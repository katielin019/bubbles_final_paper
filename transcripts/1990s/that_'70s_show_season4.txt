{START OF EPISODE 1}
Are you breaking up with me?
Well, are you giving back that ring?
- Yes.
- Then yes.
That first kiss.
Okay, well, I'm gonna call it a day.
Good night.
Night.
By the way, thanks for the ride.
God, I wish we'd never kissed.
-  -  Geez, what a drama queen.
- Who are you?
- Let's go.
- Go where?
- Well, you said you wished that you'd never kissed her.
- I can show you what would've happened if you never did.
- What are you, like, a genie?
Genies aren't real.
I'm an angel.
You're not an angel.
You don't even float.
Everyone knows angels float.
Fine.
Eric Forman God's favorite cherub come with me and I will release you of your suffering.
Don't be afraid little one.
No offense, but are you coming on to me?
- Are you ready?
- Yeah, why not?
Okay, well, I'm gonna call it a day.
Good night.
Night.
And there you go.
You and Donna never kissed.
Well, thanks.
This was nice.
- Good night.
- No, no.
We're gonna follow her home and see what happened next.
Are you an angel or a stalker?
Hey, let me do my job.
I'm gonna prove to you that it is better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all, ya pansy.
Hangin'out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We're all all right We're all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
!
Hyde was waiting for her that night?
- I didn't know that.
- Shh.
This is my favorite part.
- Hi.
- Hey.
- Thanks.
-  So you with Forman now?
I guess not.
- I mean, he didn't make a move or anything, so- - Huh.
Yeah.
- Hyde, what are you doing?
Get the hell off her!
- Eric, they can't hear you.
Don't you watch movies?
I mean, this is pretty basic stuff here.
Well, Eric, it's three months later.
Donna's with Hyde, Kelso's with Jackie, and you became-Just watch.
Does anyone want to watch Flipper?
Anyone?
Eric, I thought I told you to tar the driveway.
Yeah, but I'm hanging out with my friends.
Oh, oh!
I'm so sorry!
Now get your ass up there and get to work!
You people, out of the basement.
!
Oh, geez.
I'm sorry, Dad.
Don't be mad.
This is made-up angel crap.
I wouldn't cave to Red like that.
Ah, you've already forgotten what a wuss you were.
See, it was Donna who gave you the confidence to stand up to Red.
Oh, I'm gonna show you a lot of neat stuff like this.
Well, I guess I have no choice.
Like everyone doesn't try that.
This can't be that bad.
I'm wearing a letter sweater.
Chess Club, loser.
Ah, checkmate!
Hey, I made the marching band.
Ooh, at last I will be accepted by the cool kids and not get beat up.
Ay, no.
Not again, guys.
Hey, I got you a birthday present.
- What is it?
- A tattoo.
''Question Authority.
'' - Cool.
I love you, man.
- Prove it.
My Donna would never get a tattoo.
No, but Hyde's Donna would.
Hi, guys.
Oh, hey, Eric.
We didn't see you there.
Yeah, most people don't.
Yeah.
Huh.
So, do you still live next door?
Oh, yeah!
You bet.
Yeah.
So- Hey, Hyde, how are you?
Great.
My mom split, so- droppin' out of school.
Oh, man.
Look, Hyde, you can stay at my house.
Then you won't have to drop out.
-  - Okay, Mom.
Now get one of me giving her the corsage.
Let's roll, Twiggy.
My bra's about to snap.
I went to prom with Big Rhonda?
Sweet, huh?
Real quick, real quick.
Now, Rhoda- It's Rhonda!
Rhon-da!
God!
Rhon-da.
I'm so sorry, dear.
I told you he'd fall for the first piece of tail that came along.
Shh!
Okay- Okay.
Now smile!
Big night!
Big everything.
I'll make you a copy.
Yeah, I want to remember this night.
Whoo!
-  - Here, Son.
- You'll need this.
-  Girls like her- They like to eat before the prom.
Good luck, Son.
Hmm, another tattoo.
''Property of Hyde.
'' Classy!
What?
What's Fez doing?
- Step away from that stereo!
- But, Hyde, I got the new Leo Sayer album.
Hey, everybody!
I just made Forman a man.
Well, as much of a man as he'll ever be.
Kelso and Pam Macy?
- But Kelso and Jackie got back together on prom night.
- Never happened.
I wrote you a love poem, Pam.
It goes like this: I love your rack.
I'd love to shack up with you and do it too.
Oh, Michael.
That is so deep.
- Yeah, I kicked that poem's ass!
-  It's all a domino effect, Eric.
You see, Hyde wasn't there to takeJackie to prom, so she couldn't make up with Kelso.
See?
Oh, my God.
That's so sad.
It's like my relationship with Donna touched everyone's life.
And I was just gonna throw that a-  Okay, you're unpleasant.
Just give it up.
I don't care.
None of this is really that bad anyway.
Well, it gets a lot worse.
Come on.
We're going into the future.
- That's right: the '80s.
-  -  - Hey, what the hell was that?
Oh, you'll find out.
Welcome to 1 983- Donna and Hyde's wedding.
Man, did you have to make her pregnant?
Good God, I wish I could just wake up.
Oh-Oh, you may never wake up.
This could be a coma dream.
Congratulations, Mr. and Mrs. Steven Hyde from Cedar Rapids's number one anchorman.
Kelso, man, glad you could make it.
- Hey, oh, man, can I kiss the bride?
- Sure.
Damn it, Kelso!
You don't French the bride!
Where's the food?
- Please, honey, for the love of God- - Don't ''honey'' me.
I'm hungry, stick man.
Hey, Forman, so when are you and Big Rhonda gonna tie the knot, huh?
Oh, I don't know.
You know, I'm so busy at Price Mart, and, uh, she has her dog grooming and her cheating on me, so- Jackie Burkhart?
Is that you?
I'm sorry.
Do I know you?
It's Michael.
Kelso?
It rings a stupid, little bell.
You know, I bet if I wasn't so happy as a globe-trotting stewardess I might actually remember the tiny effect you had on me in high school.
- I'm on TV now.
- I've always loved you.
- Ow!
- Oh, oh,Jake, honey, honey.
Be nice to your big brother.
He's not strong like you.
''Brother''?
What the hell?
Your parents finally had the son they always wanted.
- Now, Son, what do we call Eric?
- Dumb-ass!
There's my boy!
Oh, what a wonderful wedding.
It's so nice when children get married and- and move far away from their parents.
Or they don't get married and stay at home with their mother who they just couldn't stand to be-  away from.
Oh, God.
Hey, Kelso, man.
I just opened your wedding gift.
- It's primo.
What do you say we go break it in?
-  - All right!
-  You're leaving?
I hate you!
Call me.
- Fez.
- Good night, Wisconsin!
This is really-  I've really missed-  We have breaking news.
I'm toasted.
Man, they pay me gobs of money to talk like that.
Fez, do something with your hair, man.
It's making me paranoid.
Guys, I have discovered a band that will change music forever.
-  -   I love to cook, you know?
- I'm really good with sauces.
-  Guys, sometimes when I do the news I don't wear any pants!
Whoo!
You know, there are some things about Earth I really miss!
Okay, welcome to your All right!
I finally grew a mustache!
Actually, it's chocolate cake.
- What happened to Kelso?
- Oh, he got fired.
Yeah, he thought the news would be funnier drunk.
Now he works for you, selling water beds.
What a loser!
- Wait, I sell water beds?
- That's right.
Kelso, what are you doing here?
You're supposed to lock up the store tonight.
It's our reunion, man.
I'll lock it up tomorrow, I promise.
- Hello, Michael.
- Hello,Jackie.
Oh, I just want to let you to know that, uh, I married Pam Macy.
She's one hell of a cook, a super lady, and I'm really, really happy.
Good, 'cause I wouldn't be with you anyway.
You're fat.
Okay, Michael.
When you're done being a pig, I'll be in the Le Car.
- Uh, I'm sorry, Rhonda.
-  - Uh, yeah.
- Rhonda?
Oh, my God, Rhonda!
Hi, Eric.
Uh, I was hoping you'd be here.
- I just wanted to thank you.
- Thank me?
Yes.
Um, after you broke up with me, I was so disgusted with my life.
I mean, if someone like you didn't want to see me-  Whoo!
So, thanks to you and Jane Fonda, I have this new, fabulous body and a successful aerobics studio.
Well, hey, you know what?
- I'm glad I could help.
- Yeah.
Oh, hey!
Hi!
Hey, Donna.
It's- It's Eric Forman from, uh, Point Place High School.
Yeah, Eric, I know.
It's our reunion.
Right.
Good one.
- So, how are you doing?
- Um, I was pretty lousy until I saw how fat Kelso got.
- It made the drive from Joliet worth it.
- Oh, right.
- I heard you guys moved.
How's Hyde?
- Hyde's good.
Kids are good.
He's gone a lot.
Prison.
Whatever.
So, Eric, uh, how- how are you?
I'm, uh, great.
I'm the number three water-bed dealer in Wisconsin.
So- - Donna, you look great.
- Oh, thanks.
You know, don't laugh, but- - Actually, never mind.
- No, no.
What?
I had a crush on you in high school.
I had a crush on you too.
You know, I almost kissed you once.
- What might've been, huh?
-  So-  So are you- are you still writing?
Oh, God.
Well, I mean, permission slips.
- Three kids, you know.
- Right.
Well, you should start again, 'cause, you know you were really good at it.
Oh, well, it's too late for that.
It's too late for a lot of- - Hey, so I'll see you, Eric.
- Yeah, I'll see ya, Donna.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Huh?
Huh?
Start the waterworks.
- Sorry.
- Come on.
You gotta feel something.
Yeah- envy.
He never had to feel the pain of losing her.
Oh, wait a minute.
You actually had a relationship with Donna?
- Wait, I thought you said he couldn't hear me.
- I'm loose with the rules.
- So sue me.
- No, seriously.
You had Donna?
Look-  We broke up.
You're much better off.
Says you!
Look at me!
I'm 28 years old.
I've only had sex with Big Rhonda, and all three times, believe me she did not look like that!
Idiot!
You're sad you were never with Donna?
Well, you got off light, man!
I had her, and I lost her!
And believe me, you don't want to know how bad that hurts!
-  -  - So -  -you're an angel, right?
- Why, yes.
Yes I am.
Can you, like- Can you do anything to help me?
Listen closely: No.
You know, Angel, thanks.
But I've got to go to sleep, 'cause I have a big day of misery ahead of me.
Okay, you win.
It was better never to have loved at all.
Thank you!
And, hey, I'll tell you what.
I'll make you a deal.
I'm gonna take it all away.
You won't feel a thing- good or bad.
Really?
Yes.
Yes, do it.
Okay.
Well, let me just remind you what you're giving up.
Hang on.
Wait.
No.
I want to keep it.
Please,just let me keep it.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Hey, Mrs. Forman.
Hey, Red.
Hello, boys.
You're up bright and early this morning.
Yeah.
We're going to Funland!
It's super fun!
Oh, Red, remember how we used to take Eric there when he was little?
Remember how I used to get on the roller-coaster with him and then,just before we took off, I'd jump out and wave good-bye?
Boy, did he scream.
Well, it sounds like fun.
Super fun!
And we figured Eric could use some fun, you know, since he and Donna broke up.
- What?
- Broke up?
Yeah, I heard Donna dumped his ass.
That's funny.
I heard Eric was the one who dumped Donna.
- Sure, he did.
- I don't think so.
- Yeah, right.
Well, Eric must be just a wreck.
-  -  -  -  Fine.
I'll just listen to A.M.  That's just cruel.
Hangin'out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We're all all right We're all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
!
Come on, Forman.
Get out of bed.
Yes, we have to go to Funland before all the fun is gone.
I'm not going.
- Geez.
- Forman, man, snap out of it.
So you had one of the hottest chicks in Point Place and you blew it.
Could be worse.
No, it couldn't.
Eric, it's not all bad.
Think about Bob being your father-in-law.
That guy'd be in all your wedding pictures.
Guys, I don't want to talk about Donna and I don't want to go to Funland.
Fine.
If you're not going with us, we'll stay here with you.
We're not going to Funland?
Don't touch the G.I.Joes.
- Hey, Eric, did you- - Hey, buddy, can we not talk?
Thanks.
Fine.
We're going to Funland.
Good.
Go.
You know what?
I'm glad you are not going to Funland because you will suck the fun right out of it.
And then-And then it would just be called ''Landland.
'' I'm sorry.
I'll get you a candy apple, okay?
Okay, okay, I got Eric out of bed.
He's on his way down.
Now remember, don't say anything about Donna.
He'll talk when he's ready.
Okay.
Gee, Son, you look like you've just been dumped.
I wasn't dumped, okay?
We broke up.
Yeah, well, run it off.
Do you want to talk about it, honey?
No.
Okay.
Are you sure?
Yes.
Yes, I'm sure.
Okay.
Let's not talk.
Eric, you are a handsome young man with a lot to offer.
Okay.
Can I go now?
No, no, no.
Not until you eat.
You look like you haven't eaten for a week.
Oh, come on, Kitty.
He always looks like that.
Well, maybe so.
But he won't have the strength to get over Donna if he doesn't eat.
Fine!
I'll eat.
Just no more talking about Donna.
For one minute, I'd like to not think about Donna.
No Donna.
- Red, you should go talk to him.
- What?
Why me?
Because I don't really know how to mend a broken heart.
I've never been dumped.
Oh, I don't believe that.
Why not?
Well, there are certain things about you that are annoying that other people might not have been as tolerant of.
You're bald!
See?
Like that!
Okay, Michael, we have to stay together.
Every time we come here you get lost.
Damn,Jackie, there's fun around every corner.
Michael, what are the rules?
Uh, no hitting you from behind with the bumper cars.
And?
And no riding the goats at the petting zoo.
And?
- We have to stay together, Michael!
- Fine!
- Balloons!
- Stay!
Hey there, kids!
I'm Woofy, the Funland Dog, and I'm here to make sure that you have fun, fun, fun!
Touch me like that again you're gonna eat your Alpo through a straw, straw, straw!
Oh.
Okeydokey.
Well, I'm going down to the saloon to look for the guy who shot my paw.
Oh, my God!
That was Woofy, and he talked to us!
Guys, we gotta pick a place to meet in case we split up.
How about the corner of Fun Street and Fun Boulevard?
I mean, that should be easy enough for even Michael to remember.
Michael?
- Great.
Now we'll never find him.
- Sure we will.
All we have to do is show people his picture, and they'll help us find him.
You have a picture of Kelso in your wallet?
Of course.
I carry pictures of all my friends.
You're friends with Nipsey Russell?
I want to be.
I know he's in there.
Go talk to him.
- I don't want to.
- Fine.
But when I broke up with Archie Wilkins, he lived with his parents until he was 40.
Good God, Kitty.
That's another 23 years!
All right.
I'm going in.
Hey, Eric.
How you doin'?
Dad, I'm really not in the mood for conversation.
Good.
Then I'll talk and you listen.
I ever tell you the story about Larry ''No Foot'' Mulligan?
Well, I can guess.
He had no foot?
Larry was a buddy of mine who lost his foot during the war.
And then, on his way back to the States ol' One Foot- at that point we were calling him One Foot- had his ship go down and a shark ate his other foot.
But he made it all the way back home.
And do you know what happened to him when he got here?
He overcame his handicap and, ironically, became a shoe salesman?
No.
His girlfriend dumped him.
Well, thank God it had a happy ending.
Look, the point of the story is, you've got both feet.
You'll be fine.
Now, put some shoes on, go on down and trim the hedges.
Yeah.
Well, you know, I think I'm just gonna stay up here.
Yeah.
Well, you know, I think you're not.
Hi.
Have you seen him?
His name is Kelso.
Kelso's trapped in a box?
Hey!
Fez, check it out.
''Fun University.
'' Now check out the back.
''F.U.'' I don't get it.
F.U., man.
F.U.!
Oh, right.
''Fu.
'' That's a good one.
That's a good one.
I tried to look for Michael, but I can't see over the crowd.
I wish Donna was here.
She's a giant.
Don't remind me.
I asked her and asked her and asked her to come, and she just kept saying ''Get out of my bathroom, Fez!
'' Well, we still have to find Michael.
What time is it?
Did someone ask what time it is?
Why, here in Funland, it's always ''Fun o'clock!
''   Yeah, yeah, thanks a lot, you morons.
Hey, you guys wouldn't happen to know what time it is, would you?
Oh, yeah!
- Rock on!
-  I thought we were in love.
Oh, God.
And then it all just blows apart.
And all that's left is this big hole, you know?
Uh, no, I don't.
Oh!
But there is a gopher hole out back.
And if you shove the hose down and flush him out I'll stand at the other end and hit him in the head with a shovel.
Uh-huh.
Just go, Dad.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Well, I see sunshine outside, but I don't see sunshine inside.
Wanna talk about the breakup, Bambi?
No, Dad, I don't want to talk about it.
You know, we were happy.
But he had to push me.
He had to define everything and get his little ring on me.
By the time it was over, we weren't even together anymore.
I'm fine.
Son of a bitch.
Listen, when you're done- I know, I know.
Put the bags on the curb.
- Hey.
- ''Hey''?
Is that all you have to say to me?
Well, what do you have to say to me?
Huh.
How about this?
''Hey.
'' - I'm not wrong!
- You are wrong, you dill-hole!
Oh, great.
That's nice.
That's really mature.
Double dill-hole!
''Double dill-hole''?
Oh, geez!
You were outside.
You were happy.
Why are you back in bed?
Well, I guess all that fresh air got me thinking that I'd rather be in bed.
Yeah, well, get up.
It's time to go to work.
Fine.
Oh, and, uh, you don't have to worry about that gopher.
It's as dead as you and Donna.
Too soon, huh?
I can't believe you two.
Poor Michael is lost, and all you've done is gone on rides and have fun.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
The Funland Princess!
The Funland Princess?
I haven't been on that ride yet.
So, I figured this is the lost and found and I lost my friends so they're bound to show up here sooner or later.
Right?
I miss my friends.
''I miss my friends.
'' - What?
- ''What?
'' - Stop it.
- ''Stop it.
'' - Stop copying me!
- ''Stop copying me!
'' - I'm stupid.
- You're stupid.
Damn it!
Hey, how about that new cashier at work?
Not bad, huh?
Single too.
- Dad, I'm not- - What?
Is it the braces?
Well you know what helps a fella get over a gal?
Pimiento loaf.
What happened here, Red?
I thought you were gonna help him.
Kitty, I yelled at him all day.
I don't know what else to do.
Well, how did you get through your first breakup?
What's to get over?
It happened.
I took it like a man.
She was the best thing that ever happened to me.
Oh, Eloise.
Oh, Eloise!
My life is over!
Yup.
Took it like a man.
That was the House of Mirrors?
I have more mirrors than that in my purse.
Why is everyone leaving?
Oh, my God.
What time is it?
Did someone ask what time it is?
Yeah, we know.
It's fun o'clock.
Get killed.
No, it's closing time, kids.
Time for you to go.
But, Woofy, we still haven't found our friend.
Yeah?
Well, golly gee, that's just too- Come on!
Get out!
- Except for you!
-    - All right.
Let's go.
- What about Michael?
Look, there's been lost dogs who've traveled hundreds of miles to be reunited with their families.
Now, Kelso is not as smart as that but I'm sure he can make it the 1 2 miles back to Forman's.
So, me and this girl Eloise were together for a while.
Everything was great.
But when things started getting serious, she dumped me.
Man, that- that hurt like hell.
- Did you cry?
- No!
No, no.
But there were times when I thought I would never get over it.
But time passed.
I moved on.
And then the day came when I didn't think about her as much.
Then a couple more days came along, and, why, I thought about her even less.
Then one day, I didn't think about her at all.
And then that made me sad.
We've got a little Irish in us, don't we, Dad?
Yes, we do.
It's just- It hurts.
You know?
Listen, I'm gonna give you a few days to pull yourself together.
You can stay in bed and sleep.
Watch TV.
Whatever you need to do.
Thank you, Dad.
And, you know not that it matters, but Donna didn't dump me.
I broke up with her.
Whatever you need to tell yourself to make it better.
Thanks a lot for the ride, Mrs. Anderson.
Hey, Einstein, you gonna eat that ice cream?
My name's not Einstein.
It's Kelso.
And, yeah, I'm gonna eat it.
- That's it.
-  -  - Get out!
- They started it!
- Get out!
See ya, Einstein.
It's not Einstein!
It's Kelso!
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Wow!
Donna, you look great.
What could it be?
Oh, I know.
You lost  Burn, Eric, burn!
Okay, first of all I weigh a 1 30- 49 pounds.
Yeah.
You look good too, Eric.
You lost your one true love, so- Looking good.
Eric, I found these records of yours, and I thought you might want them back.
Ah, the unpleasant exchange of possessions after the horrific breakup.
Awkward for them, entertaining for us.
Whoa, whoa.
Shut up.
Don Kirshner's starting.
Oh, right.
Paul McCartney and Wings are on tonight.
Okay, so- Okay, we're all here now.
So- So, Donna, you're staying?
Okay.
What I meant to say was- Look, Donna, I don't think it's cool if you hang out here.
So, what, you're, like, kicking me out?
Wow.
Okay then.
Bye.
Well, if you're kicking her out, then you're kicking me out.
No,Jackie, no.
Oh, wait.
I mean, bye!
Hangin'out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We're all all right We're all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
!
So, it's just not fair.
He doesn't, like, get my friends 'cause he has some stupid, crappy basement.
Right!
You helped make that basement what it is today.
Right.
No one would even go over there before me.
It smelled like feet.
Donna, you have to fight back.
Okay, when a couple splits up the woman deserves her fair share of the life she helped build.
- How much is that?
- All of it!
Donna, it's the law.
You know, normally, that statement would really offend me.
But now that I'm single and pissed, you're making a lot of sense.
And then shejust comes down in the basement like it's no big deal.
After what happened?
And she's just gonna act like everything's cool and everything's fine?
You don't love me, you don't get my couch or my friends.
I'm a package deal, baby.
!
So, I just told her, ''Fire up those walking sticks, Big Red, because this ain't happening.
I'm not having it.
''  Hey, Forman, we were all there, and that ain't how it happened.
You wanna talk about it some more?
Mmm, no.
- Hello, Kitty.
- Oh, Pastor Dave!
What a nice surprise.
How's God?
Fine, thank you.
So, I was wondering if, uh, Red was home.
Oh, no.
What did he do?
No.
No, no, nothing.
I just thought he might like to, uh- I don't know- goof off?
You want to spend time with Red.
- Unless it's a bad time.
- Oh, no, no, no.
This is a great time.
Oh, my God!
Red has a visitor!
Red, Pastor Dave's here!
For you!
Hurry!
Oh, yeah.
I ran into him in the hardware store.
You know, he was gonna try to paint his garage without priming.
That crazy bastard.
Oh, my.
Red has a friend.
Psst!
What are you guys doing today?
We're going to the basement.
Hmm.
Sounds fun.
But you know what sounds like even more fun?
Oh!
Playing with a bunch of monkeys?
Well, yeah.
But we got cable TV at my house which we all know has the potential for flashes of brief nudity.
Nudity!
Cable?
Oh, you are so gonna win this breakup!
Now, wait just a minute.
Eric is our friend, our brother.
We cannot just abandon him for nude boobs.
Good point, Fez.
This nudity you speak of, are we talking full frontal?
- Does it matter?
- No.
Let's go.
So, you have no idea where everyone is?
Everyone who?
Hey, you got any Popsicles?
Donna's all out.
Oh, so that's how it is?
Everyone's over at Donna's?
Eric, man, I'm sorry.
And I know that we've been friends for, like, a really long time but, uh, we were watching Barbarella on cable.
Man, and I not only saw boobs, but I saw boobs in space!
Yeah, space boobs, Eric!
There's no gravity!
She got cable?
That sneaky little wench.
No, no.
And corn dogs.
-  - Oh, dogs wrapped in corn.
Oh, sweet meat on a stick.
-Just go.
- Thank you.
''At Dave's.
Back around 5:00.
Red.
'' Oh!
I hadn't realized before, but the primer is like your emotions.
It's what's underneath the surface.
And the rust is like your anger.
Boy having a male companion to talk to is changing my life.
I wish I could tell Kitty exactly how I feel about her but I just can't find the words.
I'll help you.
We'll find the words together.
Oh, sure sometimes I feel like crying, but I just can't.
You can with me.
- Hey.
- Oh, hello.
So, how was your day?
What did you and your new friend do?
Well-   -  -  - So, that's all you did?
- Yep.
Well, you didn't talk about anything?
Nope.
- Do you hate him?
- Kitty, don't start.
No, no, no.
All I'm saying is, people with friends live longer.
And you are not good at keeping friends.
Bob's scared of you, and Earl isn't speaking to you.
- What about Frank?
- Frank's dead.
Exactly.
It is time to replace your dead friend Frank.
I win.
Oh, look, there's a boob!
There's two.
Oh, wait.
Four.
It's the mother lode.
- Oh, man.
Guy butt.
Look away.
-  I feel kinda bad.
Hon, it's just guy butt.
It won't hurt you.
No!
About Eric.
I mean, he was totally in the right to kick Donna out.
Oh, he was not right.
Now, you agree with me!
No.
-  - Agree with me.
No!
Donna broke his heart, and now she should have to pay.
- Chex Mix?
- Oh, thank you, Donna.
Oh, we are so not talking.
- All right,Jack- - I said, not talking!
- Well done.
- All right, Fez.
The- I said, well done!
Oh, there are all my friends.
Hey, Donna, I found these socks of yours so I thought I'd just, you know, run 'em right over.
Eric, you can't hang out here.
It's really uncomfortable, so- Uncomfortable?
Who's uncomfortable?
Oh, fine.
Look, man, I'd go with you, but, you know, it's cable.
Whatever.
Hey, want me to come by later and tell you about the boobs?
No!
Yeah.
It's Dave for you.
Yeah?
Fine.
Right.
Okay.
You do not grunt to a friend.
- Friends don't grunt.
-  Okay, so I was over at the Pinciottis' crouched behind the hedge next to the house, and I distinctly heard laughter.
Laughter!
Well, I will tell you what.
I am not going down without a fight.
No, sirree, Bob.
Bob!
The kids really like my jokes?
Oh.
Mr. Pinciotti, if you only knew the number of times Donna's shared one of your doozies with the gang.
Lordy, how we laugh and laugh.
- And laugh.
-  Right.
I'm goin'.
Okay.
But the tennis pro says ''We don't serve those kind of balls.
''    Welcome home, friends.
Who wants Popsicles?
Hey, I don't feel good about this.
Well, would you rather be at Donna's singing backup to ''Cha Cha Di Amore''?
-Oh.
Well, will you look who's here.
-That was a dirty trick, Forman.
Well, I'd love to stay and talk about it, but we're on our way to the movies.
Yeah.
Fine.
Then I'm taking them bowling Saturday.
Yeah!
Fine.
Ooh, what a fun weekend.
Hey, look, you guys can't buy our loyalty with these little field trips.
You're gonna have to start buying us some stuff we can take home.
Well, look, I think it's stupid to have to go day by day.
Why doesn't Donna just get us on the weekends?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
That's not fair because then Eric gets all the weekday headaches and Donna gets all the fun time.
Fine.
Then we'll make a schedule.
Eric?
Fine.
Have a seat.
Make sure to schedule time with Bob.
He takes me to Chuckle Town.
So, um, what are you and Dave gonna do today?
Go out to the garage and talk friend to friend?
That would be nice.
No.
We're gonna turn on the fight and watch two nice men beat the living hell out of each other.
That's nice.
-  - Oh.
Oh.
Oh, come on in, Pastor Dave.
Red and I are just so happy that you are here.
- Especially Red.
- Kitty.
I want you to know that it is so nice for Red to finally have a boyfriend.
For God sakes, Kitty!
Oh, lighten up, silly.
''Man friend.
'' Whatever.
Someone to talk to, share their feelings with.
Anyway, you are an important part of Red's life.
Oh.
- Well- - Wait.
No.
Don't listen to her.
I don't really want to share my feelings with you.
Hell, I don't even think I have feelings.
Now, let's just watch these two guys beat the crap out of each other.
Sold!
Well, I don't care what you say.
You're boyfriends, and that's nice.
You know, Red, I am so glad that I have someone to share with because I woke up this morning feeling upset.
Ha-ha!
I gotcha!
Good one, Dave.
Good one!
Don't ever do that again.
I'm just saying, Forman you really didn't deliver on the afternoon like I was hoping.
Dude, I took you everywhere.
I bought everything.
It was a great day.
I don't know, man.
I mean, I asked you for a six-pack.
You brought me out a tall boy.
I'm just saying.
Fine.
Whatever.
They're all yours.
Twenty minutes late.
Sorry.
We had to stop so Fez could pee.
Yes, it was my fault.
Please do not fight.
Eric, listen, travel time should come out of your time, not mine.
What's on Fez's face?
Nothing.
Nothing.
Is that ice cream?
Now he won't want dinner!
I am sorry I ate ice cream, Donna.
- Do not be mad.
- Oh.
Fez, I'm mad at Eric, not at you.
This is not about you.
Listen, I'm not about to limit our good time to help with yours.
- Why would you do anything to help me?
- Oh, you listen, missy.
- I'm not gonna- - Stop it!
Stop it!
You are tearing us apart!
I hope you're happy.
Now you've upset Fez.
Yeah, and your fighting is making me and Jackie fight and that interferes with us doing it.
And that ain't good.
So, until you guys fix this, we're not hanging out with either one of you.
Let's go.
Hyde, I'm sticky.
Come on.
Let's get you cleaned up.
And I'm sleepy.
I know.
You had a big day!
This is your fault.
None of this would have happened if you hadn't been such a jerk and kicked me out of the basement.
Well, you came in and you were just so ''Oh, we broke up, and I don't care, and, hey, let's just watch TV.
'' Tra la la la la Eric, I was faking it.
I'm miserable and uncomfortable, and this whole thing sucks.
You're miserable?
Well, that's great!
I mean, I'm miserable too.
Okay, so, how about this?
We just hang out together and pretend everything's fine for, you know- for the sake of our friends.
I can do that.
Okay.
But, you know,  you have to stop trying to look so hot when you come over.
I have not been doing that.
Red lipstick, no bra?
Okay, yeah, I did that.
And, Fez, you sit on the dryer.
Okay.
This new seating arrangement should really work.
There you kids are.
I think I finally remembered the punch line to the Italian midget joke.
- My mom made fish.
- I gotta register for the draft.
- Me too.
- I gotta go count my G.I.Joes.
I'll be in the oven.
Wow.
Tough room.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Elke Sommer to block.
Elke Sommer to block.
-  - Oh, you stupid son of a bitch.
-  -  Donna loved Hollywood Squares.
Ah, Forman.
Come on, man.
Give it a rest, huh?
So you're single now.
That's a good thing.
Now you're like me, man.
You're free to be with lotsa subpar, somewhat sleazy chicks.
It's Christmas, baby.
Oh, you disguise your heart, Hyde, but I know you need love.
- Why is that?
- 'Cause I need it.
All right.
I'm goin' to work before you two start braidin' each other's hair.
You know what?
I wish for once Hyde would fall in love, you know?
So we could make fun of him.
We'd be all, ''Hey, everyone''-  ''Hyde's in love.
''  Burn.
Oh, I know.
Let's get Hyde a woman.
We can have a ''Let's Get Hyde a Woman'' party.
And-And we can have food and music and, um- - Women?
- That's it.
Hangin'out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We're all all right We're all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
!
Hey, this party is a great idea.
I am gonna find the perfect match for Steven.
After all, my nickname is ''The Queen of Romance.
'' No one calls you that.
Now, we will each bring no less than two and no more than five girls to the party for Hyde, okay?
I will console the rejects with a hot oil massage.
I will be nude.
Well, I'm outta here.
The radio station's giving away a van, and I gotta work.
I will be clothed.
Well, I think it's a great idea.
Steven is almost a man, and he needs to meet a girl who will help him find his way.
Yeah.
A girl helped me find my way to hell!
I'm in hell.
Oh, you're not in hell.
If you're too hot, take off your sweater.
- So, it's settled.
We'll have the party here.
- No, Kitty.
I don't know what you're talkin' about, but, no.
Yes.
We're-We're havin' a little party for Steven, so he can meet his Miss Right.
Why is it here?
Why is it always here?
Well, what do you want them to do, have the party in the street?
Yes.
They puke in the street, the city cleans it up.
Oh-ho, man!
Oh, I hope I win this van.
I really need a place to do it with Jackie.
Okay.
Listen up everybody.
The rules are simple.
You place one hand on the van.
If you remove your hand for any reason, you're out.
Last person to remove his hand wins the van.
Any questions?
You're out.
Any other questions?
- Don't start without me, Max.
- Oh, God.
Hello.
My name is Daniel and I have won every WFPP contest since the Weber Gas Grill Trampoline Bounce of 1 972.
I am unbeatable, so the choice is yours: joy or despair pleasure or pain life or death.
I am Daniel!
And I cannot be beaten.
Look at what I brought.
- Big Rhonda?
- Uh-huh.
There goes the keg.
Everybody, look who's here- a caring, intelligent, snazzy young man- Ste-e-even Hyde!
Um, thanks.
Hey, man.
What's goin' on?
I thought we were watchin' Saturday Night Live.
Yeah.
Change of plans.
We're havin' a party with girls, a keg and girls.
- For no reason whatsoever.
- Great.
- And there's no agenda.
- All right.
Stop grilling me, you bastard!
Oh, hey, Melissa.
- How's the contest going?
- Lame.
But at least the boneheads are entertaining.
Check out that idiot's 'fro.
Hey, that's my dad.
- Oh!
Uh- - No.
- Okay.
Yeah.
You're right.
-  - So, hey, what are you doin' tonight?
- We're in Wisconsin so nothing.
Well, I'm goin' to this party.
It's in a stinky basement, and they'll have a stolen keg.
- I'm in.
- Cool.
Hey, Dad.
I brought you some mints and your afro pick.
Oh, thank God, Donna.
My hair was startin' to look silly.
Hey, check out the redhead.
That redhead is my baby girl Donna.
I'm her dad.
I want Donna to call me ''Daddy.
'' -  That's it!
- Ah!
Bob.
You took your hand off the van.
You lose.
This isn't over.
It is for you.
Get outta here.
And so begins the battle of wits.
Oh, man.
I've never been good at wits.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
So, chips and dip, huh?
Yeah.
And the words kinda sound alike, so that's always fun.
Look.
No offense, but I'm really not in the mood for talking.
I just broke up with my girlfriend, so- Oh, you poor thing.
You know, you have these sad lips that are just so hot.
Really?
I may not be popular, but if given the chance, I'll put out somethin' fierce.
Psst!
Psst!
How's it goin'?
Great, great, great, great.
'Cause, see, at first, I thought I should wear my hair up.
But-  let's be honest.
My hair is one of my top five features.
So, voila!
It's down.
Psst!
Psst!
Hyde, allow me to introduce you to a special lady.
So we meet every week to pray and discuss Scripture.
You in?
I used to date your dad.
Isn't that a turn-on?
It's not like head cheerleader's always the most talented but in my case, it's true.
I have to date guys who aren't as good-looking as me, otherwise, I'd never date.
You gonna eat that?
I know you're really angry and emotionally crippled but that's okay, 'cause my boyfriend's in jail.
My turn-offs include people who are mean to puppies and people who smoke or don't smoke?
Or smoke?
Wait.
Do you smoke?
Okay.
So guess which leg's real.
I'm so glad I finally got to meet you, 'cause I've, like, always been afraid of you and I like to be scared.
So?
What do you think?
You know, I think, if I time this right I can nail every single one of these girls tonight.
No, no, no, no, no.
You're supposed to pick just one- to love, not nail.
Love.
Yeah.
Right.
Okay.
Listen to me,Johnny Cool.
I threw this party for you, so you can find one girlfriend to love you.
And that is all.
One.
- You set this up?
- Yeah.
We all thought you needed help finding a quality woman.
What?
Man, you sit around and talk about me?
Is that what's goin' on?
Look.
I don't want your help.
I give and I do, and I do and I give.
And for what?
For nothing.
Well, I'm done.
Go.
- But, Fez- - I said, go.
- Hey, Hyde.
- Hey.
This is Melissa.
She just moved here from Chicago.
Work at the radio station together.
- Melissa, this is Hyde.
-  You're not leaving already, are you?
- Uh, no.
I came out to get some fresh air.
-  Oh.
It's, uh- It's fresher out here- the air.
I like air.
How 'bout you?
Air's okay.
You know what's really good?
Water.
That's really-   This summer I'm gonna visit my aunt in Mississippi.
Oh, you're goin' away?
That is sad.
Hey, you should come with me, chocolate milk.
When I looked across the room, I saw a guy who was wounded- a guy who sits in the dark waiting for the light to find him again.
If only I could find this light you speak of then maybe-just maybe- my pain might go away.
Would it help if I held you?
I doubt it.
But let's try, Katie.
Yeah.
Lower.
Yeah.
I am so disgusted.
Oh, I know.
There are way too many girls at this party.
I can't even smell my own perfume.
Well, you're the only one.
You know, you may not even be the prettiest girl here.
You shut your hole.
I am pretty!
Unsure.
Must find Michael!
Hi.
You know I'm a guy who's wounded.
- So I'm gonna go grab a beer.
- Thanks.
Get one for yourself too.
No.
I- Ca- - Can I get you a beer?
- There you go.
- Thanks.
- Right.
A toast to all my good friends.
I will miss you when I blow out of this burg with the beautiful Big Rhonda.
Now it's off to ''Missis-syphilis''!
Oh, no.
Red, they've been drinking.
Well, well.
What do ya know?
Here, Kelso.
Thought you might need some coffee to keep you goin'.
Hey, you know what would be fun?
- Seein' which one of us could drink the most coffee, huh?
- Uh-huh.
Oh, no.
- You'll just lose.
- Wha- No.
I would not.
- I could so beat you.
- Well, I doubt that.
- Oh, you're goin' down.
- Hmm.
- That's my six to your one!
- Yeah.
Ya really whipped me.
Kelso, have you ever been to Niagara Falls?
- Uh-uh.
- Hmm.
Don't you like the soothing sound of water?
- Yeah.
I guess.
- Hmm.
You ever sat beside a babbling brook listening to the beautiful, steady stream of water?
Well, I- Okay.
I don't know if you realize this, but a-all this talk about water is really making have to go pee.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
I can see that ''urine'' a lot of pain.
Yeah.
Well, y-you better shut up, 'cause you're gonna have to go too.
That's where you're wrong.
I am going.
I know I just met her, Mr. Red but I love her.
She is sturdy.
I want to climb her.
You're just desperate to give it away, aren't you, son?
Yes.
Yes, I am.
Look.
There are two things that you need to learn about women.
Oh, finally, the sex talk!
First: If a woman outweighs you by 30 pounds you're in for trouble.
But I'll put on weight.
I'll bridge the gap.
Which brings me to my second point.
- When used separately, women and alcohol can be a lot of fun.
-  But if you mix 'em, they can turn you into a dumb-ass.
- Michael!
-Jackie.
- I thought you were at the party.
- No, no, no.
It was awful.
Do you know what it's like to be the prettiest girl at a party and not have anyone acknowledge it?
Yes, I do.
- Michael, am I pretty?
- Oh, come on, cupcake.
- You are the prettiest girl in Point Place.
-  No.
You know what?
In Wisconsin.
Nice one, Pinocchio.
- Am I prettier than Pam Macy?
-  Of course.
Am I prettier than Farrah Fawcett?
Oh, all right.
Come on.
She's like a perfect 1 0.
And you are an 1 1 .
- Am I prettier than- - Oh, my God!
Am I prettier than the girl with the feathered hair at the supermarket?
Okay, okay, the blonde-haired one or the brown-haired one?
Well, does it matter?
No, 'cause ya smoke 'em both, baby!
-  Am I prettier than- - Oh, my God!
I can't take it anymore!
Am I pretty?
Am I pretty?
Am I pretty?
Shut up!
And we finally have a winner.
I did it!
Oh, my God.
I won!
Who's the best?
I'm the best!
Loser!
I'm not a loser, okay?
I win everything.
I don't lose.
I win!
Because I'm a winner!
I'm a winner!
So, Michael Kelso, tell Wisconsin how it feels to be WFPP's new Hand 2 Van winner!
Well, I guess I have to say it like this, Max: If this van's a-rockin' we're in there doin' it!
- Michael!
- Oh.
Um, I'm sorry.
I'm doin' it with Jackie Burkhart!
If you really think putting my head on your lap will make me feel better I mean, I guess I should try.
All right.
That's it.
Excuse me, girls.
I have some information- No.
Don't listen to what she's- I'm- She's the one who hurt me.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
He dumped me.
You dumped her?
Well, I had to.
She wouldn't- She wouldn't take my ring.
You wouldn't take his ring?
This is none of your business.
And you are a sad little man.
Tsk.
Oh, poor baby.
- Do you want my number?
- Yes.
Yes, I do.
- So, you havin' fun?
- That reminds me.
I have to go.
Uh, Melissa um, I was wonderin' if maybe you wanted to do somethin' sometime.
Sorry.
I did something last night, and I already made plans for sometime.
No.
Wait, wait.
Uh, let me try that again.
Um, look.
If you're not doing anything Friday night I'd like to take you out to, uh- to- to dinner and a movie.
Pizza?
The mall?
Bowling?
I'd love to.
Call me.
Call you?
That's a little unorthodox.
I'll call you.
-  - Ye-e-es.
''I'll call you.
'' ''I'll call you.
''  Whipped.
What?
I don't care about her.
Melissa who?
What the hell.
Whipped like the family pig.
Rhonda, I cannot go to Mississippi.
So, you're not coming?
I'm sorry.
But maybe we can go to the movies sometime.
And make out in the theater?
Yeah!
Call me.
- Good God.
Sober up, man.
-  Oh, screw it, Donna.
Fez likes them big.
Fez likes them small.
Fez likes them all.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Steven, it's 7-damn-30 in the morning.
What the hell are you doing here?
Red, be nice.
Steven, we're waiting.
Oh, I've been living in the basement.
You know, I did notice a dusting of curly hair on the floor but I just wrote it off to my changing teenage body.
I moved back in when my dad got transferred.
Transferred?
He's a bartender.
Where'd he get transferred to, the jukebox?
You know, Red, if it's cool, I'd kinda rather not talk about it.
Well, Steven, it's important to get these things out in the open.
Kitty, let him do what's natural and keep his feelings bottled up.
Attaboy.
Well-  welcome back, Steven.
You know, maybe we can spruce up your old room since I decided to redo the basement.
What?
You're redoing the basement?
Well, honey, no one uses it.
I use it.
Every day.
It's my Batcave.
I'll find you a good, cheap contractor.
Oh, no, no, no.
This is something I want to handle myself.
- This is going to be expensive, isn't it?
- Maybe.
Don't you like anything cheap?
I like you.
Hangin'out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We're all all right We're all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
!
Yeah, I'm gonna miss it down here.
A lot of good times.
I broke my foot climbing out of this dryer.
Yeah, I hit my head playing handball with the soap in that shower.
Me and Jackie totally did it, like, a bajillion times on this old sofa.
Michael, that's private.
I got news for you.
It wasn't that private.
Oh, my God!
That is the biggest spider I have ever seen.
I think it had a rat in its mouth.
Okay, I think maybe the basement isn't the place for me after all.
Oh, you know what, Mom?
I think you might be right.
I mean, not only is it bug-infested, but in all honesty I think it might be haunted.
Get out.
That's spooky.
I don't know, Mrs. Forman.
I mean, sure, it's a pit now but if you paint, fumigate and get rid of Eric, this could be a great room.
Hey, wh- Hey, okay.
You're not my girlfriend anymore.
Okay?
So you don't get an opinion on my stuff now.
Mom, don't listen to her.
She's crazy.
Wait, I disagree with you, so I'm crazy?
I think the last time I disagreed with you was the sanest thing I ever did.
Okay, are you referring to our breakup?
Because I must remind everyone that she wore my promise ring around her neck.
That's crazy.
Ring, finger.
Finger, ring.
- Well, you're lucky I didn't shove the ring up your ass.
- Mom!
All right.
Wait.
Who said, ''Get out''?
Anyway, Mrs. Forman, we have a bunch of decorating magazines at home.
- I'll bring 'em over.
- Well, thank you, Donna.
And I think that ring looked nice around your neck.
Donna, what the hell?
What, we're not going out anymore so you don't like my basement?
Well, I guess now that I'm an ex-girlfriend I'm free to tell the truth.
Free at last!
Free at last!
Whoo!
- Michael, get Eric some ice.
- Why?
For that wicked burn!
Burn, Eric!
Burn!
Oh, happy day.
Your friend Fez has taken his love of dance to its logical conclusion.
I have joined a ballet class.
Man, no offense, but you're, like, one good cry away from being the total woman.
Oh, really?
Well, would a total woman have her own pink satin slippers?
Oh, Red, here.
Um, meet our contractors.
This is Theo and- Hey, Mr. Eric's Dad.
This is who you hired to redo our basement?
Well, no, no.
Actually, I hired Theo.
And, uh, I didn't really expect Leo.
That was, um- That was a bonus.
Here.
Shoo, Leo.
Don't worry, ma'am.
Leo is solid.
And he's not allowed to touch anything electrical.
Kitty, I hate to interfere- I understand your concern, sir.
But I'm not an irresponsible screwup like my cousin Leo.
That's true, man.
I used to be like Leo, sitting around all day, wasting my life.
But then one day the smoke cleared.
See, Red?
He had an epiphany.
Actually, I ran out of weed, and the smoke cleared.
But, uh-  then I saw how trashed my apartment was, so I rebuilt it.
Been a contractor ever since.
Well, I'm sold.
Okay, Donna, when did you stop liking my basement?
I never liked it.
There were a lot of things I kept to myself when we were dating.
Yeah, well there were plenty of things I kept to myself.
Plenty.
Like what, for instance?
I'm sure Donna would like to know.
Yeah, like what, for instance?
Well, like-  why don't you just start first?
Okay.
You know how when you eat, and you smack your lips in that really cute way?
Yeah.
It's disgusting.
That's all you got?
No.
You have tiny wrists.
What?
No, I don't.
Mom, do I have tiny wrists?
No, not tiny.
Dainty.
No, no, no.
No, no.
The doctor always said you were in the normal range.
See?
Normal, Big Bone Magoo.
Ooh.
That's nice.
You don't have to tell me.
It's really cool you're here.
Most men won't take ballet class.
Oh, my pet, most men are not Fez.
This whole basement thing is Donna's fault.
I mean, what's her problem?
She's been messing with me all day.
- It could be payback.
- For what?
Well, she had to see you naked for two years.
That must've been unpleasant.
You know, for a guy who's been orphaned twice, you really lack compassion.
Speaking of hurtful things- Hey, where's your dad, man?
Okay.
He, uh- He went to work for the police developing high-tech handcuffs to restrain people with tiny wrists.
Hey, uh, puffy-shirt guy called.
He wants his puffy shirt back.
Things at ballet class have taken a turn for the worse.
Somehow, I've become one of the girls- a hairy, brown girl.
Hey, uh, Fez does that shirt come with its own bicycle pump?
You should talk.
That shirt makes you look like a stick of Fruit Stripe gum.
God, what did you have for breakfast this morning Carnation Instant Bitch?
Okay, that one was out of the park.
I am so bored with you two.
You know what?
I actually want to talk about Fez.
Fez, why don't the women at ballet love you?
I don't know.
They let me touch their thighs but not their hearts.
You know what might help?
If you dressed a little more masculine.
Hey, Hyde, you know what my favorite ballet is?
The Nutcracker?
Hey, guys.
Don't you think it's time to knock off?
You know, maybe forever?
Yeah, well, we're not done yet.
Don't let us get in your way.
Do whatever you'd normally do.
This is what you normally do?
I used to do this, too, back when I was being an artist.
I love art.
But I hate work.
But I love art.
But I hate work.
Do you hear that, Forman?
Theo's an artist who hates work and who at this moment is very open to suggestion.
Oh.
I gotcha, Hyde.
Theo, cluck like a chicken.
Do it.
Ow!
Oh.
Theo, if you're unhappy, and I hope you are you gotta be true to yourself.
Give up construction, man.
Go back to art.
You broke up with Art?
I don't know what Eric's problem is.
I wasn't being a bitch, was I?
Oh.
Donna, I know from bitch, and yes-yes, you were.
But I feel much closer to you now.
All right.
Okay.
I know what's going on here.
You're being mean to Eric because you wanna do it with him.
When Jackie dumped me, I had a buttload of leftover ''wanting to do it with her'' feelings.
Oh, my God.
You morons might be right.
But why do I have these stupid feelings left over?
I just want to be friends with him now.
What a child.
So innocent.
You're never gonna be friends with him.
The only reason he was friends with you was so he could do it with you.
Really?
So he made friends with me when I was five so he could do it with me when I was 1 7?
Well, that and your sweet Big Wheel.
Okay, off to ballet class now.
More masculine, yes?
Okay.
We're all done.
But you've only been here a day.
Well, you know what they say: Rome was built in a day.
No.
Uh, ''Rome wasn't built in a day.
'' Oh?
Well, your basement was built in a day.
Ta-da.
Y-You didn't do anything.
It's a commentary.
See, you wanted to change your basement into something that it wasn't.
So instead of giving you something that you thought you wanted I gave you something that you needed.
Red, I think my contractor's on dope.
No need to thank me.
Oh, we won't.
Because you didn't do anything, hophead.
Look!
It's art!
I moved everything in this basement two inches to the left.
Oh, yeah.
I call it ''Basement- Two Inches to the Left.
'' It's wild, huh?
I mean, it's like- Where are you?
All right.
Mrs. Eric's Mother would like you to leave now.
Okay, you don't get it.
But when your life shifts two inches to the left you're gonna call me.
Oh, yes.
You are gonna call me.
!
And if you like our work, tell your friends, okay?
Well, well, well.
- Look who finally got his basement back.
- Yep.
Outwitted two hippie burnouts.
- Walk tall.
-   So, hey, Hyde.
Come on.
Where's your dad?
Really.
Fine.
You want to know?
He and my mom got back together.
No way.
No way.
That's great.
So, where are they?
I can't tell you.
- Why not?
- 'Cause they won't tell me.
They split on you?
Oh, man.
Oh, man.
See, this is why I didn't wanna tell you.
I knew you'd get all After School Special on me.
Me?
Please.
It's okay.
You're home now.
- Get off me, man.
- No, you let me love you, orphan boy!
Don't hide from your feelings!
- So, hey.
- Hey.
Look, I'm sorry I've been so- Bitchy?
Yeah, I hadn't noticed.
Who said ''bitchy''?
Yeah, well, it turns out that there are some lingering feelings or something.
Not real feelings- just, like, lingering urges.
But they're just lingering feelings.
They're not actual feelings.
I just wanna make that very clear.
You have.
By using the word ''lingering,'' like, six times.
Okay.
And the basement's actually really cool.
And your wrists are very wide.
-  - Hmm.
Um, there must be some way to break the tension here.
Oh, I know.
Let's just have sex.
- Okay.
- Really?
No.
See ya.
Like I wanted to.
I did want to.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
- Good morning.
I have terrible news.
- Are we out of bacon?
- No.
I was outside, and- - Remember that time we were out of bacon?
Do I?
Nearly tore this family apart.
Listen to me!
Midge left Bob.
Are you sure?
I mean, maybe she's just lost in the backyard.
This is serious.
I was up early, and I saw Midge getting into her car with a suitcase.
And I said, ''Where are you going, Midge?
'' Because I'm concerned, not nosy.
And she said to me, ''I am leaving Bob, and I am never coming back.
'' And I said, ''Okay.
'' And then I- I- I laughed like I do when I'm uncomfortable.
But what about Donna?
I mean, what are they gonna do?
Well, okay.
They are going to depend on the kindness of their friends and neighbors which is why we need to go over there as a family to comfort them.
- Yikes.
No.
- I don't think so.
- Why not?
- Well, it just seems like it'd be- like there'd be an awful lot of- - Crying.
- Yeah.
- So, no.
- Yeah, no.
Well, fine.
Then I will go myself.
Hey!
Where are you going with my food?
To Bob and Donna.
When your wife or mother leaves you, you need a good breakfast.
I need a good breakfast.
I didn't leave you.
Eat a Pop-Tart.
When I woke up, her bag was packed and she left.
Didn't even say where she was going.
On the other hand we have pancakes with egg eyes and bacon smiley faces!
The hash-brown hair is nice.
I can't believe she would just take off without even a hint or a warning.
No warning?
Dad, she was always saying, ''I'm unhappy, and I'm gonna leave.
'' Honey, that's just what married people say.
Did she say where she was going?
Well, she said she was going to California to- to be a star on Broadway.
So- Oh, Midgie.
She may not have been smart but she sure was sweet.
And built too, boy.
Okay.
Thanks, Mrs. Forman, but I'm really not hungry.
Oh, what a nightmare.
She was unhappy, Bob.
No, she took the Eldorado.
Hangin'out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We're all all right We're all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
!
So Midge just took off?
Ah, poor Donna.
Yeah, this is really bad.
Yeah, not only did Donna lose her mom we all lost Midge's sweet, uptown rack.
Oh, good God, man, what a marvelous set of kittens.
- Remember that sweater?
- Oh.
Remember the other sweater?
Yeah.
Remember that time she ran up to us in a sweater?
Remember the week she took up jump rope?
In a sweater?
Eric!
What are you boys thinking about so hard?
- Nothing.
- Homework.
-Jesus.
- Kittens.
Okay, um, Eric, I need you to take a casserole to the Pinciottis.
So run upstairs and put on a nice, clean shirt and a sport coat.
What?
No, I'm not going over there.
Donna and I broke up, and things are weird with us.
Well, that's too bad.
Because I went over there, and Bob's a crier and a hugger.
And when you get caught in a crying-Bob hug, there is no escape.
And I cannot go back over there!
I don't know.
I like to be hugged by Bob.
He makes me feel safe.
Okay, okay, there he is.
Go talk to him.
No, Kitty.
It's a personal matter, and I- Oh!
That's mature.
Oh, hey there, Red!
Hi, Bob.
What a day, huh?
What a day to be alive.
I feel great.
You do?
Well, then I can go back inside.
Bye.
Yup, Midgie's been on me for weeks to weed the garden.
I'm finally gettin' around to it, so when she comes back, she's gonna see that I did it.
You think she's coming back?
Well, why shouldn't she?
I did all the right things.
We had an open marriage, experimented with drugs.
I even threw nudist parties.
Yeah, what more could a husband do?
All right.
Let's not get bummed out, guys, okay?
There are a lot of other hot older women out there besides Midge.
And they deserve our respect, 'cause they can teach us stuff.
Yes, I would love to make love to an 80-year-old.
They must know everything.
And not just about sex, but history and trivia too.
Yeah.
The young ones are too timid, but the older ones- They know it won't break.
How could it break?
It is invincible.
Yeah, and plus, they're, like, grateful you know, so they'll do it with, like, almost anybody.
Anybody?
Well, that's me!
Let's find Fez a dirty housewife to love.
Yeah, man, I'm in.
Hyde?
I don't know, guys.
I was gonna go watch Donahue.
What do you think the chances are of Fez gettin' burned?
- Pretty good.
- Damn good.
Then I am in.
- Hey.
- Hey.
So hey, look, I'm really sorry about your mom.
And, uh, I mean, are you okay?
I don't know.
It's weird.
Yeah, well, you know, it won't make you feel any better but for some reason I brought you a casserole.
I mean, why is it that every time something bad happens, grown-ups always think you need food?
You lost your job?
Congratulations, you get a bucket of chicken!
I mean, the last thing you want is to- Are these crushed potato chips?
Look- Donna, look.
I know we broke up but I still, you know- I still care about you.
Okay.
Okay.
So- Eric, in the bedroom.
Oh, yeah, I knew that.
I'll just- I'm gonna- Is that a tennis getup?
Yup.
Yeah, I'm out.
What's his problem?
This is the perfect outfit for picking up older ladies.
Uh-huh.
How's that?
Well, everyone knows that horny older ladies hang out at tennis clubs.
Yeah, well, see, Fez Point Place doesn't have a tennis club, or even a tennis court.
We do have that concrete wall behind the gym but people mostly use that just for smoking weed and beating up freshmen.
And foreign exchange students.
You were new, okay?
No.
You know where we gotta go to get the ladies is the grocery store.
Oh, the Piggly Wiggly?
I love the Piggly Wiggly.
They have candy.
Yeah.
And older ladies.
And candy.
Yeah, but the important thing is the older ladies!
And candy.
All right, Fez.
What do you want, the older ladies or the candy?
Fine, you win.
The older ladies.
- Thank you.
- And candy.
It was the sport coat, right?
- Again?
- Yes, please.
So, you don't want to cuddle?
That's cool.
Bob thinks Midge is coming back?
That is the saddest thing I ever heard.
Oh, come on, Kitty.
Let him think it.
Who does it hurt?
It hurts Bob.
Well, who else does it hurt?
-  - Steven.
Red, Bob has to grieve so the healing can begin.
But, Kitty, then he'll grieve all over me.
Hey, remember that time Bob ate a bad taco and grieved all inside your car?
Thank you.
Case closed.
Why would you bring that up?
Well, sorry, Mrs. Forman.
It's just that it was gross, so I think about it a lot.
Hi, kids.
Good to see you.
Good to see you.
Someone is looking lovely today, Mom.
What's with you, man?
I guess a little thing like getting back together with your old gal puts a spring in a man's step.
You and Donna are back together?
That is wonderful!
So, did you talk things through?
No.
Then how do you know you're back together?
Yeah, we talked things through.
Talked or grunted?
Stifle.
Okay, well, good.
I'm gonna need details.
Oh, there will be details aplenty in my steamy letter to Penthouse.
Okay, my mom's still behind me, isn't she?
So, you guys did it?
Twice.
Five times!
Nice.
Yech!
And you're back together?
Oh, yeah.
God, no.
It was like magic.
Oh, I feel sick.
Yup, we're back together.
And, Hyde, more than this, much more than this-  I'm sure he's forgotten all about it.
Man, back when I was cheating on Jackie I used to meet a ton of older ladies here.
Hello, Michael.
Hey,Joyce.
That's Coach Ferguson's wife!
Yeah.
She's lonely, and she drinks.
Oh, you're a Piggly Wiggly god.
Yeah.
Ooh la la!
Oh, me like.
Well, make your move, man.
Ay, no.
After I painted Midge's bathroom pink sprinkled a little lavender water in her toilet like she likes I went out and got these chocolates.
I hope she likes 'em.
I guess we'll find out when she comes back, huh?
Bob, she- I- Aw, Bob, you poor, dumb son of a bitch.
That's mean.
Bob, she's not comin' back.
- Yes, she is.
- No, she's not.
- Yes, she is.
- No, she's not.
- Yes, she is.
- No, she's not!
- Yes, she is!
- Fine!
These chocolates are for Midge, Bob?
They're for Midge?
Fine!
Let's give 'em to Midge!
Here you go, Midge!
You're throwing away Midgie's chocolates.
And why would I do that, Bob?
'Cause you're mean!
And why else?
She's not coming back, is she?
I knew that.
Listen, you wanna go get a beer?
Yeah.
Yeah.
You're a good friend.
I might cry.
And I might hit you.
Michael, how could you bring poor, sweet Fez to the Piggly Wiggly?
There are a lot of footloose women in that store.
Do you know Joyce Ferguson?
Who?
No!
That's a lie!
- What?
- What?
- What?
- What?
And you!
Grabbing strange rear ends is no way to meet a nice girl.
It's rude, ungentlemanly behavior that will not be appreciated by a woman of class.
And thank you for the compliment.
It made my day.
You know what I just noticed?
Mrs. Forman is hot.
Yeah, she's a cutie.
And firm.
You know, maybe we should get her a sweater for Christmas.
She actually doesn't want to be with you at all.
Isn't that hilarious?
Yeah, he thinks you're back together.
It's really sad.
Hold on.
What?
Look, she said she would've done it with anybody.
No, no.
Donna wouldn't say that.
I mean, it was like I would have done it with anybody.
Anybody?
Damn, and I was just over there watching stupid Donahue.
Hey, let's do it right now.
Eric's gonna be so mad.
-  Are you mad?
-  So mad.
Yeah, I'm just kidding about the ''do it'' stuff.
-  I'm sorry about your mom.
-  Thanks.
You know what?
That's it.
She can't use me like this.
I'm goin' over there to yell at her right now!
With yelling!
Seriously, let's do it right now.
Okay, listen.
You need to tell me what the hell you think you're doing!
What am I doing?
Well, my mom left us so I'm boxing up her clothes, because I can't look at them anymore.
I'm sorry for needing you, but I did.
So if you have something to say to me,just say it.
Okay, thank you!
I did have something to say, and it was good!
But that was before you said your mom stuff and your sad clothes stuff and now my s-sex stuff sounds sucky.
Look, I'm sorry if you thought that we- No.
No, I'm sorry.
Let's just-What-  What, do you need some help or something?
Yeah, thanks.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
This is mine.
-  - Midge borrowed it, and she never gave it back.
I bet my bra's here too.
I miss my li'l Midgers.
Bob, you know the rules.
You cry, you buy.
Three pitchers, please.
Hi.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Hey, Mrs. Forman.
My dad's making a cheese sandwich, but he's missing some stuff.
So, can I borrow bread and cheese?
Oh, your dad's having a hard time without your mom, isn't he?
Midge was the brains of that outfit?
Oh, I'm- I'm sorry, Donna.
- Sorry about what?
- You, get Donna bread and cheese.
Okay.
Wow.
This is a really nice dress.
I know.
Isn't it fancy?
It's for the Price Mart Ball tomorrow night.
Oh, right, the Price Mart Ball.
So who you takin'?
Who's the lucky lady?
Oh, well, I decided not to go.
Personal choice.
You don't have a date, do you?
Okay.
You know what?
It's not about, ''Can I get a date?
'' It's about this great book that I'm, like, halfway through.
Plus, you know, I could get a date.
-  - I've got numbers, buddy.
Sure you do, honey.
You're number one with me.
You're going tomorrow night.
And you'd better not go stag, Eric.
There's nothing worse than an 80-pound boy dancing with his mommy all night.
You know what?
I'll go.
I told you I would, like, months ago.
But that was before the ugliness.
Eric, I'm over it.
Hey, I'm over it.
Oh, I'm- I'm over it.
Plus, I mean, last year they had all-you-can-eat shrimp.
Well, I mean, you know, I'm over it.
Hey, I'm over it.
Yeah, I'm over it.
I was just worried that you might think it was weird, us going out on a date.
So, I mean, you know, the concern laid with you.
Eric, it's not a date.
It's not- I know.
I know it's not a date.
It's not a date.
It's a shrimp fest.
A festival of shrimp, if you will.
- Exactly.
- Okay.
- I'll see you tomorrow night.
- 'Kay.
-  - See, now, look.
My little prince is going to the ball.
Hangin'out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We're all all right We're all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
!
-  - So, Forman, you break up with Donna but you still get to have sex and go on dates with her?
Ride the big red wave, dude.
I should break up with Donna.
''Donna, we are through.
Let the sex and dating begin.
'' Oh, no.
It's not a date.
We're just friends now, because she's over it.
- Well, guess who else is over it?
- I am.
- Me too.
- So over it.
Look, man, breaking up sucks, okay?
When Jackie dumped me, you know what she said?
''Somethin' somethin'.
Never wanna see you again.
Blah, blah, blah.
'' Hey, you think that didn't hurt?
Okay.
You know what?
- I'm done talking about this.
- Good.
But I will say this.
If she doesn't want it to be a date, then it won't be a date.
I am so cool with that, because as we all know I am very mature.
Now, if you would all please excuse me my mommy has to iron my corduroys.
Ah, women.
Am I right, guys?
Ah, who am I kidding?
There's no woman for Fez.
What must Fez do to get a woman?
Well, for one thing, he's gotta cut out that third-person crap.
It's weird.
You are Fez.
You know somethin' else?
Shoes say a lot about a man.
In your case, your chukka boots are screaming ''virgin.
'' Damn you, boots.
What else have you told them?
Hey, Fez seeing you wear those chukkas makes me wanna up-chukka.
- Nice.
- Yeah.
It's like I ate too many ''chukkalate'' chip cookies.
Okay.
Yeah, how much wood could a ''woodchukka'' chukka- Hey.
Shut the chukka up.
How am I supposed to afford new boots?
My Bible-thumping host parents won't give me an allowance because I am a pagan.
You know, Leo's looking for help down at the Fotohut.
The Fotohut, huh?
I can really ''picture'' myself there.
That job and I will really ''click.
'' Oh, I am on a ''roll'' of film.
Ow.
Don't be so ''negative.
'' I am the king.
You sure you wanna get in the Fotohut game?
It can chew you up and spit you out like a stick of gum.
Or something that seemed edible till you put it in your mouth and then you realized it's not.
Or a stick of gum.
- What kind of gum?
- Big Red.
Oh, that's fine.
Okay, you're hired.
But you're on probation.
No, wait.
I'm on probation.
Oh, wow.
I gotta go see my probation officer.
- So he's my new boss?
- Welcome to paradise.
Oh, Red.
Don't the kids look nice for their date?
Yeah.
Nice as hell.
- Oh, well, thanks, Mrs. Forman.
- Actually, Mom as Donna so thoughtfully pointed out earlier, this isn't a date.
Well, I just- I like seeing you together.
You just-You look so natural.
But we're not together.
Well, sure you are.
I'm looking right at you.
Let's spend the night in the driveway looking at the kids.
That's what I wanna do.
Oh, hang on one sec.
Oh, hey, Donna?
Why don't you make like a circle and go round, okay?
That's right.
Like a circle.
Slide over or I'll hit you in the head.
All right.
-  You got yelled at .
- Shut up.
Oh, okay, this is us.
See?
This is great.
Being out together, not on a date,just friends.
I feel, like, virtually nothing for you.
Me too.
Here.
Let's have a seat.
Here you go.
Oh, whoops.
Not a date.
- Eric!
- I'm sorry.
Okay, uh, minor glitch.
Let's let the good times roll.
Isn't this nice?
Okay, Kitty.
Enough jawin'.
Drinks are only free for the first two hours.
Oh, do you think they have peach schnapps?
Peach is my favorite schnapp.
Hi.
I'm Lyle, Housewares manager in Oshkosh.
Hi.
Eric, stock boy, Point Place.
And this is my friend Donna.
We're not on a date, even though, I mean- even though I did pay for her.
But what can you do?
Tell me, Lyle.
Are you here on a real date?
Uh- Hey, that's Stewie.
Stewie.
Nice going.
Scared off Lyle.
Now we'll never meet Stewie.
Eric, what is wrong with you?
Hey, guy.
Put your arm around your date.
- Oh, no, she's not my date- - Oh,just shut up and take the picture.
Ta-da!
Quittin' time, chief?
No.
I devised a system to streamline our operations.
From now on, all orders will be filed alphabetically.
So the size of a customer's boobs?
No longer a factor.
You see, it saves time.
And time, my friend, is money.
But money is not time.
You'd think it would go both ways, but it doesn't.
Hey, Moby Dick called.
He wants his shrimp back.
It's those hilarious jokes that I miss so much since we broke up.
So, uh should I get us some punch or- Wait.
Do you get the punch?
Oh, no.
How do we get the punch?
Eric, stop it.
You're being an ass.
Well, why don't you just, you know, get over it?
I only said that because I wanna be friends again.
I mean, I wish we could pretend that we were never boyfriend and girlfriend and just, you know, be friends.
Donna, it's hard.
It's not like being friends with Hyde, okay?
I haven't, you know touched his fun parts- well, on purpose.
- We used to have a lot fun together.
- Yeah.
Just like there used to be shrimp in the world.
- Okay.
- Hmm.
Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
When I get back, we're gonna have a lot of fun together.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Hello.
Hi, I'm Connie.
Pet Supplies, Sheboygan.
You, uh, wanna dance?
Oh, uh- Yeah, I'm kind of here with someone so- Okay.
Well, um, maybe I'll see you around.
Okay.
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Okay, you hurt my arm.
She was a real looker.
And for some reason she talked to you.
- Now go get her.
- What?
No.
Dad, Donna's here.
Well, Donna's off having fun while you're sittin' here being a big lump.
Okay, first of all you are way too involved with my life, okay?
And second of all, Donna's not having fun.
She's in the bathroom.
That's not the bathroom.
Now, go talk to that girl before she comes to her senses and wants nothing to do with you.
Oh, God.
Your mother's doing shots with Gladys from Housewares.
Kitty, put it down.
My wife left me.
I don't cook.
I don't shop.
I'm hungry.
This place scares me, and I like Salisbury steak.
So you don't cook or shop, and your idea of a nice meal is gristly hamburger smothered in goo?
What woman could let all that go?
Hey, I've got an upside.
Th-There are things.
I know.
You're a good guy- a good, old-fashioned, out-of-touch, Stone Age guy.
But, you know, there's nothing wrong with you that changing yourself completely couldn't fix.
- Thank you.
-  Here.
In the meantime, have a pretzel.
- I can tell you haven't eaten anything.
- I am pretty hungry.
Oh, never shop when you're hungry 'cause you'll end up at home with 1 5 Salisbury steaks.
Give me those.
See, the problem is I have a daughter at home.
I think I'm gonna have to start feeding her.
I don't think I can do this.
Of course you can't.
Lucky for you, I'm here.
Now we just gotta find everything you need to make a meat loaf.
Wow.
You're gonna make me a meat loaf?
No.
You're gonna make me a meat loaf.
Okay, but sometimes I burn myself on the oven.
- I'm, uh- I'm Bob.
-Joanne.
Now haul ass, Bob.
- Oh.
- Oop.
Oh, sorry.
Sorry.
Oh, Donna.
Oh, oh.
So, are you having fun at the big ball?
Um, yeah.
You know, at first I wasn't.
- Eric was being really jerky and weird.
- Uh-huh.
Well, he does that.
If he gets me a glass of punch, it's not like we have to sleep together.
Well, it would have to be pretty good punch.
They have an open bar.
Uh!
I just wish Eric could relax.
Well, um, I think he can.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh, good for him.
I'm- I'm glad.
He's dancing with a beautiful skank!
Well, I will say this about Price Mart: They have wonderful balls.
Red, grab that centerpiece.
Oh, hey.
Here's another.
Donna, honey, grab that centerpiece.
Kitty, how many centerpieces do we need?
Red, they are center pieces.
!
- Okay, so don't lose my number, all right?
- All right.
Eric, what the hell?
- What?
- Why are you kissing her?
- You're on a date with me.
- It wasn't a date.
Well, it is now, you bastard!
Now come open my car door for me before I kick your ass!
The Fotohut's cool.
Hyde, your job kicks ass.
Yeah.
I never thought I'd be a workingman, man.
But, man, here I am working for the man.
And you know what, man?
I like the man.
Hey, thanks, man.
So, my probation officer was sure happy I came by.
He even wants to see me for some additional years.
He's a good guy.
Ugly, fat, whorey, old whorey, old, four-eyes, ugly, fat.
Oh, this one's kinda cute.
I mean, for a fatty.
I mean, for a whore?
Damn,Jackie!
What do you want me to say?
That's it.
I cannot work like this.
Anyone who doesn't have to be here must leave.
-  Fez- - I said, leave.
Damn, Fez.
You've only been here one day and you're already trying to change everything.
Yeah.
It's like we crossed into some different dimension where we're in some kind of Fotohut.
It's eerie, man.
And then you encourage him and what happens?
He ends up kissing a girl while he's on a date with another girl.
Once again, an open bar spells disaster for the Forman family.
Red, I am not drunk.
I am upset and drunk.
All I know is that is not the way to behave on a date.
It wasn't a date.
Oh, please.
Good morning.
No.
It was morning when I got here, on time.
Now, put this on.
Clever, huh?
Yes, very.
Fez-  Working here is about goofing off- you know, creating a model of inefficiency.
You're ruining the Fotohut, man.
And if you think I'm gonna stand idly by you're right, 'cause that's what I do here.
Oh, Hyde, you're here early.
Oh, slick uniform, man.
Is that how you spell Fotohut?
Yes, but Hyde won't wear it.
- Something's gotta change around here, man.
- Amen.
-  - I don't like what's goin' on here, man.
That little dude's making us all look bad.
- I'm afraid the boss is gonna fire me.
- Leo, you are the boss.
Did you fire him yet?
I'll take his shifts.
Hey, dude, man.
I think we decided that you're fired.
Oh.
Well, that's a cold slap in the groin.
How am I supposed to afford my new boots?
Here.
Just do what I do, man.
Just get some money out of the register when the boss isn't lookin'.
Once again, Leo, you are the boss.
And I'm not lookin'.
- Hey, kissy-face.
- Ah, well.
If it isn't Kooky McShrimplover, who doesn't know how she feels.
Comin' over here like everything's normal and nothin' happened last night.
Yep.
That's my Kooky McShrimplover.
I know.
I freaked out.
I'm sorry.
Well, that's a first.
Well, this is complicated, okay?
I mean, we do wanna be friends, right?
Yeah.
I don't wanna be nothing.
Okay.
Well, then, maybe some rules will help.
Like, when we're out on a date that's not a date - we can't make out with slutty girls.
- Uh-huh.
Or that could just be a rule for me.
Yeah, I mean, Donna, feel free- No.
Feel encouraged to make out with all the slutty girls you want.
What is this?
Is this-  kissy girl's phone number?
Uh-huh.
Okay, see ya.
I got it.
Her phone number is 729-36.
I think there are a couple more numbers than that.
Really?
Oh, yeah.
It's 729-36- ampersand?
Maybe, but I just don't really know how to dial that.
Just- Oh, yeah.
That'd be hard.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
- Oh, Wanda.
- Oh, Derek.
- Oh, Wanda.
- Yes, Derek?
You're not just my next-door neighbor.
You're also the love of my life.
Derek, I, too, have strong feelings of love for you but I have to give back this promise ball and chain.
I must leave Point Upon the Place and explore the world with my trusty cat named Sir Bonkers.
No.
- I'll never let you go.
-  - You can't make me stay.
- Oh, no?
What if I told you that I've run over the cat named Sir Bonkers and the cat named Sir Bonkers is no more?
Now submit and be my wife!
Derek, once you were a kind, peaceful man but love has made you wicked.
Oh, I am wicked.
And until you agree to be my wife I will scour the earth in search of cats named ''Sir Bonkers'' and I will kill them all!
Or at very least, spray them with water which everyone knows they hate.
I can't believe Donna would publish this in the school paper.
I know.
This could be in Reader's Digest.
It's that good.
Oh, this is the worst short story by an ex-girlfriend in a school newspaper ever.
Hangin'out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We're all all right We're all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
!
Well, if it isn't Playboy reading, panty-loving, cat-killing Derek.
I know.
How could Donna write this?
Why are you upset?
It's this Derek guy who really gets the shaft.
Fez, I am Derek.
Everything always has to be about you.
Fez, man, think about it.
Eric killed Donna's cat.
Derek killed Wanda's cat.
Donna found panties in Eric's Vista Cruiser.
Wanda found a chastity belt in Derek's Vista Carriage.
Hey, you guys, you know what goes really good with a bad short story?
Pinball!
- No.
I hate pinball.
- Hate it or love it?
- Hate it.
- Or love it?
Come on, guys.
I'm gonna buy a so let's play so I can make some money.
Where'd you get $50?
- From Jackie.
- Hey.
Oh, hey,Jackie.
Can I borrow $50?
- For what?
- To buy a dress for you.
Okay.
Wait a minute.
Eric, Derek.
Panties, chastity belt.
Dead cat, dead cat.
Oh-ho-ho!
I still got nothing.
Come on, Red.
Bob really wants us to meet his new lady friend.
Now, think about it, Kitty.
She likes Bob.
I have a hard time believing this woman even exists.
We're gonna get over there, Bob's gonna be sittin' in a rocker with a lady's wig on.
''You look lovely tonight, Bob.
'' ''So do you, Bob.
'' You've been working on that all day, haven't you?
Yeah.
Red, Kitty, I'd like you to meet a very special lady-Joanne.
Well,Joanne, it is so nice to meet you.
- Right, Red?
- We can't stay long.
Ah, Red.
Bob warned me you can be a pain in the ass.
Well, I'll tell you what.
We'll just have dinner and if it turns out you don't like me, we'll never invite you over again.
Really?
I like you already.
Well, let's get this barbecue started.
Bob, grab that meat.
Oh, I got it, Red.
Why don't you fellas make a salad?
Salad.
Oh, you're serious.
No, see, Bob and I do the grilling.
Not this time.
Kitty, you wanna give me a hand?
- Well, I'd love to.
- Oh, I don't think- But, Kitty, you might set your lovely hair on fire.
Well, it can't be that hard.
You do it.
Bob, what the hell's goin' on here?
Look, Red, I really like this woman so please, for today, just shut it.
Shut it?
Good God, Bob!
Is she teaching you to stand up for yourself?
- Yes.
- Well, cut it out!
I want to have a nice time.
Come on.
I'll give you first dibs on the aprons.
You want the fake tuxedo or the fake hairy chest?
Oh, damn it.
Give me the tuxedo!
Whoo-hoo!
Hairy chest is Joanne's favorite.
It's probably 'cause she's got one.
Ah!
Well, if it isn't the wielder of the poison pen.
- Didn't you like my story?
- No.
No, I didn't.
That's why I said ''poison pen'' not ''marshmallow pen.
''  What?
- This story is about us.
- No, it's not.
You took stuff from our life and put 'em in your story.
Like the time you found those Playboys under my bed.
Begone, Sir Bonkers.
Derek, look what I found under your bed.
Lewd renderings of naked serving wenches.
Did you commission these?
So what if I did?
I have needs, woman.
Now, ready thyself.
On this night we fornicate.
Okay, well, maybe there are some similarities.
But that's what writers do.
I mean, we take stuff from our lives.
Yeah, but you made me mean all the time, and that's mean.
Okay, maybe I exaggerated some stuff 'cause, you know, I'm writing this for stupid high school girls.
Oh, my God!
Great story!
Michael, Steven just told me that instead of buying me a dress you spent my $50 on this stupid machine.
Jackie, I did not.
Oh, yeah, I did.
Jackie, listen.
There's an old saying: You buy a girl a dress, and she looks pretty for one night.
But you buy her boyfriend a pinball machine, and she looks pretty for life.
Okay, there's another old saying, Michael: You're dumb as dirt.
That's true.
That was in the yearbook.
Okay, okay.
All right.
Listen, listen.
So, I bought a half stake in this machine, all right?
So that means for every quarter I put into it, I get half back.
That's a 50% profit!
Uh, actually, Kelso, I think that's a 50% loss.
Fez, I know it's hard for a foreigner to understand our complicated capitalist system.
But we're dealing with quarters here, not frogs or chickens.
Well, I'm not going to dignify that with a response because I can't think of one.
But when I do, a good day to you.
- All right, Fez.
Y- - I said, kiss my ass.
So, you still mad?
No.
No reason to be mad.
Your story is just a pathetic attempt to rewrite history and make yourself look good.
I'm pretty sure everyone's gonna know who the dill-hole is here.
Eric, it's just a story.
No one's gonna think anybody's a dill-hole.
- Cat killer!
- Bastard!
- Porn freak!
-  Okay, they could be talking about anybody.
Hey, we're all porn-freak bastards but he's the only one who killed a cat.
Okay, okay.
This school obviously needs to hear the Eric Forman version of things A.K.A. the truth.
So I'm gonna write my own story.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's right.
I'm throwing down the gauntlet, baby.
Really?
Okay, smarty, what's a gauntlet?
A gauntlet?
What's a gauntlet?
What's a gauntlet?
I don't know, but it's down, lady.
- Boy, this chicken's delish.
What a chef.
-  You really know your way around a grill,Joanne.
Mine's dry.
No, it isn't.
It's tender and delicious.
Maybe if I chewed it with some water.
Well, there's the hose.
- I don't like her anymore.
- Well, I do.
Kitty, I'm chopping vegetables Bob's telling me to shut it you're over there grilling with Susan B. damn Anthony.
Well, fine, Red.
If it bothers you we can invite them over, and you can do the grilling.
But for now, I'd really appreciate it if you'd just shut it.
If one more person tells me to shut it- What?
You might actually shut it?
Please, Wanda, you don't have to boil me alive.
Killing your cat was just a horrible accident.
I know, but I'm a witch.
Dear God, why is a nice, sensitive guy like me dating a lying, manipulative witch like you?
Well, maybe it's because even witches have itches.
All is forgiven!
God, why do all my stories end like that?
Don't stop.
I like where you were going.
All right, guys.
It is time to make a withdrawal from the First National Bank of Pinball.
Oh, man.
No one's playing.
Well, I would've played, but my frogs and chickens wouldn't fit into the slot.
All right.
I know what the problem is here.
This thing has been here for so long that people have forgotten about it.
I just need to advertise.
So,Jackie, put on a bikini and stand in front of the machine.
Michael, I am not wearing a bikini in here.
It would cause a riot.
Okay, what if I just put up flyers with a picture of you in a bikini?
Yeah, okay.
I mean, it'll still draw a crowd but at least they'll remain orderly.
Okay, so I just need some Magic Markers and a picture of you in a bikini.
Oh.
I have one.
Keep it.
I have plenty.
So, guys, check out my story.
I passed out a bunch of copies at lunch today.
Oh, Forman, this kind of thing always blows up in your face.
Don't ever stop doing it.
What the hell is this?
Oh, you- you didn't like my story?
Oh, yeah, I loved it.
Especially this part.
Wanda, I have performed every task thou hath asketh of me.
Please, can we finally consummate our love?
I beseech you.
Well, I said I would.
So I won't.
But I beseeched you.
Okay, let's consummate.
- Really?
- No.
Please.
I beseech you.
- Okay.
- Really?
No.
Now rub my enormous feet.
Um, guys, I don't understand.
What does ''consummate''mean?
It means to have sex.
Really?
Now I have two words for that.
Eric, you just wrote this to hurt me.
What?
I did not!
And, hey, so did you.
Look, when I wrote my story, I just sat down, and that's what came out.
I didn't, like, plan it or anything.
And besides- No, you know what?
I don't have to explain myself to you.
Okay, I'd like someone to explain it to me.
Uh, well, that's easy, Fez.
See, Donna, as an artist wrote her story to get some perspective on her life.
Forman, as a vindictive ass wrote his story to be a vindictive ass.
Oh, Eric, I think you just consummated yourself.
See what I did there?
Looks easy, but it's not.
Well, steaks are a-cookin'.
Ah, what should we have to go with dinner?
Oh, I know.
How about a salad?
Say,Joanne, why don't you make the salad?
- No, thanks.
- Oh.
Aww.
Make the salad.
Unless you don't like to do lady jobs.
Red, put this in your mouth.
Okay, you know what?
I'll make the salad.
Heh!
- Sit down, Bob.
- Sit down, Bob.
- I'd love to make a salad.
- Great.
As soon as Red admits he's not asking me to make a salad he's trying to put me in my place.
You are woman.
I hear you roar.
I can't believe you're so threatened by something as trivial as me grilling chicken.
It's not trivial.
Men grill.
It's been that way since the first caveman bonked a woolly mammoth on the head and threw it on the barbecue.
And his cave wife made the salad.
- I smell something burning.
- Oh, darn!
Well, if you didn't want it well done, you should've said something.
What the hell!
Where's my pinball machine?
Oh, where, indeed?
I remember.
I convinced the owner that pinball was out, and Space Invaders was in.
Fez, why would you stab me in the back like that?
Well, rest assured, Kelso, your frogs and chickens comment had nothing to do with it.
Well, why then?
Hey, Eric, we're sorry we called you a cat-killer bastard porn freak.
Oh, so, you read my story, huh?
No, we read part two of Donna's story.
The ending is so beautiful.
Part- Huh?
Beauti-What?
''And as Wanda walked away, she knew in her heart she would never stop loving Derek.
'' Wow, that's good writing.
It's emotional, and it screws you.
Hey.
Hey, so, uh, funny thing.
Um, your story had a second part, huh?
Yeah, the paper broke it in half, 'cause it was too long.
Oh.
Well, uh, you know, maybe my story has a second part too.
Eric, your story ended with, ''And he never saw that crazy bitch again.
'' Well, you know, that was just a prequel to a story entitled, uh ''He Did See That Crazy Bitch Again, and She Was a Delight.
'' Okay, I was- I was pretty mad when I wrote that.
Eric, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings but I guess I was mad when I wrote mine too.
At least when I started.
But once I got all that stuff off my chest, I mean, I felt better about us- more like the second half of my story.
So, uh- So what happens to Derek and Wanda?
Well, in the story, they went off on their own adventures.
Yeah.
Yeah, I mean, that's probably good for them.
Yeah, it's probably time they moved on.
Sure.
Derek's gonna be fine.
He's a smart guy.
The wenches love him.
Yeah, well, Wanda's gonna do great too.
Oh, yeah, sure.
She'll get all the wenches she wants.
Oh, my God, Donna, there's your story.
- ''Wanda and the Dirty Wenches.
'' -  - Shut up.
- I know.
I know.
That's a movie.
Uh!
Oh, Fez, I can't hold my feelings inside any longer.
Yes, we must finally tell you how much we desire you.
And it's not just us, Fez.
Oh, I knew it all along.
Now let's consummate me.
Ahh, oh, boy.
This is the best story ever.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Well, here are my boys!
How was work?
Oh, you know,just another day of restocking upper Point Place with durable household goods.
Sleep soundly, Wisconsin.
I got some big news from the Price Mart home office.
Ooh!
They finally gonna let you physically discipline the workers?
- No, but I still have a free hand at home.
- Right.
Headquarters is having every manager make a departmental training film.
And they picked me for the stockroom.
- Stockroom.
Wow!
- Yeah!
Steve from Oshkosh got ice and snow management.
Loser.
Well, Red, that is wonderful.
Yeah, I know.
Every single Price Mart stock boy will be trained in the Red Forman way.
Oh, you mean, undermining their self-esteem until they're too weak to fight back?
If you would just zip it for a second you might be interested in hearing who I want to play the stock boy.
Oh, look, Dad, I appreciate the thought- I'm gonna use this idiot!
- All right!
-  Hangin'out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We're all all right We're all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
!
Man, I guess my movie career is getting started sooner than I thought!
Kelso's playing the stock boy?
This is my favorite thing ever.
Well, Michael does have marvelous bone structure.
Oh, but you will too, honey, once you fill out.
Oh, man!
Mom burn!
Yep.
That's twice the normal burn.
Dad, how can you choose Kelso to play the Price Mart stock boy?
You have a better suggestion?
Hello!
I am a Price Mart stock boy.
I just came from stocking.
At Price Mart.
And I am currently wearing a Price Mart stock boy smock.
Good point, Eric.
Give your smock to Kelso.
Oh, I don't think my broad, photogenic shoulders are gonna fit in that little thing.
Now, don't take this personal, Son.
You're just too twitchy and skinny.
Well, you know, the camera adds 1 0 pounds.
Yeah, 1 0.
Not 40.
How could he pick Kelso to play the stock boy?
I'm the one with the acting experience.
Remember?
I was Mushroom Number Two in Alice in Wonderland.
But you were Mushroom Number One in my heart.
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.
What's up?
- We're going to lunch.
- We're going to lunch?
Well, actually, honey, we're going to lunch.
You and I are going to lunch?
Well, no.
You and Donna and I are going to lunch?
Well, almost, honey.
- You and Donna are going to lunch?
-  Nothing gets past you, Einstein.
I don't think I like the idea of you two going out to lunch together.
Well, what if we bring you back a sandwich?
Well, a sandwich isn't gonna make me feel better, Mom.
Okay, then.
We're leaving.
Well, in that case, I would like a sandwich.
Yeah, I don't like this day.
Hey, dudes.
Hey, Leo, man, Huggy Bear called.
He wants his suit back.
Huggy Bear?
This is my suit, man.
So, to what do we owe the fancy pants?
Great news, man!
I inherited a million bucks from my dead uncle!
- Shut up.
- No way.
It's true!
So, come on!
Let's share the wealth!
Come on.
I'll buy you anything you want.
Does that include burgers and nudie mags?
Include?
That's half the budget, man.
Eric, have you seen Donna?
She was supposed to help me sort out my daytime cosmetics from my nighttime cosmetics but she never showed up.
Oh, you haven't heard?
Donna's got a new friend and I, for one, think it's time you met her.
Donna!
What are you doing?
We invented a new cookie.
It's a variation of the snickerdoodle.
We're calling it the ''DonnaKitty.
'' Or the ''Ditty.
''  We haven't decided.
Donna, you're supposed to be sorting- as in, my cosmetics.
Oh, yeah.
I'm real sorry I missed that.
It started as an annoying, but innocent lunch.
And now they're inventing cookies.
It's growing, man.
It's the freakin' Blob.
Donna, why do you need a new friend?
Haven't I always been there for you?
Uh, no.
I hope your cookies burn!
Eric, old people and young people are not supposed to spend time together.
It's unnatural.
What am I supposed to do about it?
Well, you better do something.
You know what girls talk about when they get together.
Um, sugar and spice and everything nice?
That's what we're made of, you dumb-ass.
They talk about men, and that would be you.
Well, barely.
You know, you could really use a refill on the ''everything nice.
'' You know, I wasn't that worried about Donna and my mom talking about me but now that I'm all paranoid I'm all, like paranoid.
I mean, when did it become okay for them to be friends?
Right after your father replaced you with a semi-literate pretty boy.
That's me.
So, I've been thinking about great actors to model myself after and I choose Travolta.
Kelso I can think of no better way to impress Red than by acting like Travolta in his industrial film.
Bravo, man.
That is good advice.
Man, I don't want Donna and my mom talking about me.
Yeah, and Donna's a big mouth.
Like, she told me how you wore makeup to last year's class picture.
What?
I did not!
I did not.
I had a zit.
Stop looking at me.
Forman, you and I are both victims of parental abandonment.
Luckily, I have a rich hippie benefactor.
He bought me nudie mags I'd never even heard of.
Yeah, I'll stock this shelf!
.
But someday I'm gonna dance across this whole city.
That's dead-on.
Okay, we need to talk.
It's about, shall we say, your new crowd.
And don't even pretend you and Donna aren't talking about me.
I know what's going on here, and it goes a little something like this-  Oh, honey, you look wonderful.
Say, can we look at Eric's naked baby pictures again?
They're right here!
My, you could tell even then he'd always be small.
Yeah, he really is tiny.
It's not satisfying.
Well, how could it be, dear?
But at least he's nice.
Yeah, he's nice.
For a nancy boy!
So, what do you say to that?
All right, Kelso.
You'll just go through a few typical stock boy tasks while I firmly, but kindly, oversee you.
- Got it.
- All right.
Let's get started.
Kelso what the hell are you doing?
Oh, see, I'm going for a Travolta thing.
Okay, my character's actually a dancer who's just stocking shelves until he makes it big.
All right.
Let me paint a picture for you.
Just close your eyes.
Okay, imagine with your eyes open.
Just come with me.
Just stack the cans, moron.
But why am I stacking cans?
See, I'm thinking that the manager is a bad guy.
So, why would I stack cans for him?
Because if you don't stack the cans the manager is going to kill you.
Oh!
So I'm afraid for my life!
That works.
All right.
Let's act!
Oh, no.
You're all alone.
Where's your little buddy, Skipper?
Okay, sweetie.
My friendship with Donna is making you uncomfortable, so I'm gonna call it off.
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.
Well, thank you.
Maybe some of your loyalty will rub off on Dad.
Oh, don't let that bother you.
Michael may have movie-star good looks but you are much, much smarter than he is.
Okay, why couldn't you have said that in front of everyone instead of how great Kelso's bone structure is?
I don't want to make anybody feel bad.
Well, good job.
All right, guys.
Let's shop!
Thanks again, Leo.
Yes, thank you.
You know what would make this outfit perfect?
A cockatoo.
Then we'll get a cockatoo.
Or three!
Hey, Red, listen, I've got this great new idea I want to lay on you about our movie.
Dad, I've heard this idea and speaking as an unbiased observer with no score to settle it is great.
Go!
Kelso, you don't get to have ideas.
Dad, if I could just interject.
This idea will literally change industrial filmdom forever.
Go get 'em, Kelso!
Go!
Okay.
The stock boy has a love interest.
No.
Now, before you say no, I've already found the perfect person.
Oh, stock boy, I love you!
No.
Get out.
Okay, um, Eric's uncomfortable because he thinks we talk about him- which we don't.
Although that story about him wearing makeup to his class pictures was a hoot.
But I guess what I'm saying is, um we probably shouldn't see each other anymore.
But it's been so nice having someone to talk to since my mom left.
I know.
Someone who understands what I'm going through.
Oh, honey.
Someone to make banana bread with.
I ate that for dinner three nights in a row.
Oh, you poor, sweet girl.
What the hell?
Boy, being a millionaire is great.
Well, at least you put the money to good use.
Fun Tart?
Don't mind if I do.
Candy button?
I've got a million of them.
So, Leo, man, tell us about your Uncle Ed.
Why'd he leave you all his money?
Check it out, man.
It's all in this letter he sent me.
Your Uncle Ed is Ed McMahon?
Yeah.
Who knew I was Scottish?
Uh-oh.
Damn, Leo, you didn't inherit a million dollars.
That's a sweepstakes contest.
Well, then who has my money?
There is no money, you son of a bitch!
Oh.
Wow.
I guess all this stuff has to go back.
Oh, that means you too, Feathery Frank.
- Good day.
- But, Fez- I said, good day.
I'm leaving Brooklyn, Mister Formanelli.
And when I get to Manhattan, I'm gonna be a star.
So, what do you think?
You're fired.
You.
Price Mart is only as strong as its weakest stock boy.
Just look at what one well-trained worker can accomplish.
Neat, efficient, organized.
The Price Mart way.
And each job completed with that award-winning Price Mart attitude.
Remember,you can't spell stock boy without ''Oh, boy.
!
'' Perfect.
Well, who would have thought a stock boy would do a good job playing a stock boy?
Yeah, I mean, it's a topsy-turvy world.
Yeah.
You did a good job.
Wait a minute.
Are you proud of me?
No, no, no, no, no.
I didn't say that.
So do we hug now?
Men don't hug.
My daddy loves me!
- Shut it!
- I love you too, Daddy!
Oh, well, look who's here.
Do a little shopping, ladies?
Well, it's not like I can take my dad shopping.
I mean, every time the sales lady brings over some underwear he gets embarrassed and goes, ''Whoo-hoo!
'' So, I suppose you have something snarky to say about that.
You know what?
I don't.
- Really?
- No.
Look, your mom can't take you shopping, so it's cool with me if you guys want to hang out.
Honey, I am so glad you understand.
- Yeah, Eric, thanks.
- Yeah.
Yeah,just, look, please no talking about me, okay?
And no looking at my naked baby pictures either.
They're misleading.
Honey, I've already seen you naked.
Mom.
Oh, and she's already seen you naked!
You know what?
From now on, that's all we should talk about.
Okay.
Leaving now.
Okay, here he is on the potty.
Look how hard he's concentrating.
Oh, I have some earlier ones.
Look at that baby.
Didn't he have the cutest little behind?
Yeah!
So when did he lose it?
Right around when he turned 1 0.
It was the strangest thing.
Poof.
Like someone ironed him.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
So, what are you boys doing tonight?
Well, this evening, Miss Big Rhonda returns from the dirt farms of Mississippi.
I am off to the bus station and she will melt into my loving arms.
Well, you better wear a raincoat, 'cause she ain't small.
She is big, isn't she?
Well, I'm taking this chick up to the lake for some you know, bird-watching.
Ooh, bird-watching.
I think me and Jackie are going to go ''bird-watching'' too.
It's cool, 'cause they don't know what we're talking about.
Think they cracked it, Kelso.
Well, I guess it's just us Three Musketeers tonight, huh?
''All for one and one for all,'' right?
Well, um, actually your father and I were gonna do some reading upstairs together.
What your mom's trying to say is, ''Go away for 20 minutes.
'' Forty-five minutes, Red.
- Thirty.
- Thirty-five.
Fine.
Get lost for 3 5 minutes.
Fine.
But you know what?
I got a little question for you.
Why have kids if you ain't gonna spend time with them?
I suggest you use your 3 5 minutes to think about that.
He needs a new girlfriend.
Come on, Kitty.
You're on the clock.
Oh, you know what?
Just turn off your clock.
I'm gonna go talk to him.
You can't turn off the clock!
She doesn't understand the clock.
Hangin'out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We're all all right We're all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
!
Cocoa Puff!
.
Mashed potato!
- What are you doing here?
- Well, I wanted to see you because I wanted to ask you something.
- Will you go out with me this Saturday?
- Oh, my God.
- Course I will!
-   Can't breathe.
- It hurts.
- Ah, suck it up.
Wow, strong girl.
Crap-alula.
Fez just asked me out.
I'm so nervous, and I left my asthma puffer in Mississippi.
I've never been on a real date.
What am I gonna wear?
Who cares?
You could be naked with a welding hat and Fez'd still be all over you.
Well, that sounds fun.
But I want it to be special.
- You know what?
We'll help you get ready.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, that'll be great.
I wanna look pretty.
Pretty?
- Oh, sweetie, maybe you can learn some jokes or something.
-  Look, dropout, this coupon says - So pay up!
- Is there, uh, a problem here?
This sad little man has fungussy feet but won't spend the 20- Stacy.
Mr. Forman, his coupon expired.
- Oh, that's all right.
-  -  - Here's your 20 cents.
Now, you come again, huh?
- Mushroom foot.
- Stacy!
I'm sorry, Mr. Forman.
It's just that he's such a dumb-ass.
I like you.
Hey, you know who I like?
Nixon?
Stacy, that cute, new cashier at work.
You should ask her out.
Sorry, Dad.
I don't like to dip my pen in the company ink.
Well, I don't like you being home three Fridays in a row.
Look, if you don't have the guts to talk to her - I'll pave the way.
- Hey.
Listen, if anyone's gonna talk to her I'll talk to her.
Well, then we know no one's gonna talk to her.
Hey, I might.
You- You still like girls, don't you, Son?
No, Dad, they're yucky.
Oh, my God.
I know.
She is seriously hot.
No, not her.
This KISS alarm clock.
Check it out.
Wake up.
Yeah, this I like.
Forman, you have a responsibility to all of us to find out what's underneath that smock.
I bet it's boobs.
So, spying on her, huh?
Well, that's mature.
Why don't you just pull her hair and run?
- Yes, let's do that.
- All right.
All right, all right.
All right.
All right.
I'm gonna go do this.
- Yeah, all right.
I can't do this.
- Oh, geez.
- I'll go talk to her.
- No!
What?
Now you're gonna start listening to me?
Go!
Grease the wheels, pal.
Thanks for doing this.
I know you guys'll make me pretty and stuff.
Rhonda, it's no problem.
We'll just help you pick some nice clothes- clean clothes- and maybe do your hair- clean hair.
Okay, the beauty ambulance has arrived!
So, first things first.
Let's get rid of those shoulder pads.
What shoulder pads?
Okay.
So, Stacy, my son Eric is about your age.
And he's a real nice guy- skinny but nice.
And I was thinking the two of you should go out.
What do you say?
Well, I kinda like someone else.
Oh!
Oh.
Oh no.
Hey.
- So, did she like me?
- Who?
- Stacy.
- Who's Stacy?
-  She's not interested.
- She's not interested?
How can she not be interested?
Who is she?
See?
I knew I shouldn't have let you talk to her.
Great.
Now she thinks I'm a freak.
Oh, she doesn't think you're a freak.
Does she?
Yes.
Yes, she does.
- You better stay away from her.
- Well, your father's right.
If anyone's a freak, she is.
Did Stacy actually use the word ''freak''?
Why don't you just let it go?
Maybe the reason girls don't like you is because you just don't let things go!
Stacy was saying just that thing today.
I'm gonna go take a bath.
Well, now, who is this Stacy who doesn't like my son?
I have half a mind to call her mother.
I tried to set Eric up with this pretty girl at wor- Well-  not pretty.
Decent.
Less ugly than most.
Good enough for a young boy, but no man would be interested.
Red, what are you talking about?
Why can't anyone in this family just let things go?
Red, you're blushing.
Don't tell me she has a crush on you.
Kitty, I don't wanna talk about it.
Okay.
So, do you like her back?
Hi.
Stacy.
Hi.
I'm Eric Forman.
Look, I, uh, feel a little silly about my dad asking you out for me.
You probably thought I was, like ugly or slow or something.
So, I just wanted to say hi- you know, give you a chance to you know, take a gander at the goods, so to speak- and, uh, see if maybe, uh, tomorrow night you wanted to have dinner?
At your house?
Will your dad be there?
'Cause I'll go if he's there.
Okay.
What, do you, like-  do you, like, like my dad?
Oh, my God!
You like my dad?
Do you know if he's seeing anyone?
Yeah.
My mom.
And they bought furniture together, so yeah, I think it's pretty serious.
Ladies sit up straight.
Candy!
Ca- -Jackie, she doesn't have to sit like that.
- Yes, she does.
- Stop doing that!
- You stop doing that!
Hey!
If I don't get a freakin' M&M, I'm gonna start swingin'!
You stay out of this.
-  -Jackie, try to be more sensitive.
Donna, I am not gonna send her on her date looking like Sasquatch.
Huh?
She said you're very pretty ''atch.
'' Hey, guys.
I got news.
Turns out Stacy doesn't even like me.
- Yeah, we kind of expected that.
- Ooh.
I thought you said you had news.
Well, yeah.
Here it comes.
- She likes Red.
- Ohh!
- Oh, my God!
- Ohh.
You're gonna have to leave town!
- Why?
- Oh, 'cause we're gonna tell everyone!
Tell me this.
How'd the 50-year-old guy get the girl?
Look at me.
I'm an attractive man.
Well, I got you.
Technically, I got you.
And then you blew it.
Which means you didn't lose it, because you never had it.
See, there's your silver lining.
Eric, you have a lot of good qualities.
I mean, you're funny.
Like- Well, what just happened to you is funny.
Look, that chick likes Red because he's a tough guy, a hard-ass.
You?
You're soft.
How soft is he, Hyde?
Softer than Liberace at the Playboy Mansion.
Yeah!
'Cause he plays piano.
Wait.
Ohh!
Burn!
You guys kill me.
Look.
How come Red is such a hard-ass, and I am so- I mean- Okay, when a bear has a baby it's a little bear, right?
My dad's a bear, but I'm like a duck.
Eric, you were a bear when you were born but Red pounded you into the duck that we know and love.
So, what are you saying?
It's- It's Red's fault?
Yeah.
But the good news is, as a duck you can move more easily through the water.
And now back to Night of the Living Dead.
And now back to Night of the Living Dead.
Is everything okay over there, Stacy?
Come here, Mr. Forman.
I wanna show you something.
Holy crap!
You're a zombie!
I want Red.
Red!
How could you?
She's a sexy zombie!
She overpowered me!
I knew I couldn't trust you, you cheater!
Kitty!
What the hell was that?
Oh, Kitty.
Oh, I need to talk to you.
I just wanna say with regard to this Stacy thing- Look.
I'm bound to attract a certain amount of attention.
I can't help that.
- But I would never- - Oh, Red.
You wouldn't stray.
You've got too much character.
And who could blame her for being interested?
You're certainly interesting to me.
Really?
Do you, uh have some spare time?
Why?
Am I on the clock?
I'm thinking 45 minutes.
Ohh.
The scenic route.
I give you the new Rhonda!
First time in heels.
So, where's Fez?
Oh, he's nervous, so he's in the ''whoo-hoo.
'' Have you been working on her all night?
She wouldn't even let me pee.
I'd squash her like a bug if I could catch her.
But I do look pretty.
Rhonda, is that you?
Boy, you look like a different girl.
Do you like it?
Oh!
Well, I thought we would begin our evening with a hot dog eating contest.
Now, I realize you're county champion but I think I could make it interesting.
Sorry, Fez.
I don't eat hot dogs for glory or money anymore.
It's not ladylike.
- Says who?
- Says them.
Them?
What have you meddling whores done to my Rhonda?
- It was Jackie.
- It was Donna.
Fez, she wouldn't let her pee or eat.
- Donna called her Sasquatch.
- That was you too!
Shut up!
Shut up.
I just want her back like she was the first night I met her- on her knees, chugging beer straight from the keg.
But, Fez, I threw up twice that night.
Yes all over my heart.
You big, lovable, clumsy galoot.
And now, it is time that you two left.
Good day.
- But, Fez- - He said, ''Good day''!
So, I'm a duck, huh?
Yeah, we'll see who's a duck.
Oh.
Hey, there you are.
Yeah, we need to talk, man.
I've been thinking out this whole Stacy thing- It's your fault.
Yeah.
You were too tough on me, so now I'm soft.
Oh, boo-hoo.
You don't know the first thing about tough.
My old man was tough.
When I was your age, he shipped me off to the navy.
He sure as hell wasn't settin' me up with cute cashiers.
Which I'm sorry I did.
Because now I've got this creepy little girl giving me google eyes all day stickin' heart-shaped notes in my locker.
And on top of it all I had to have a talk with your mother about infidelity.
That was unpleasant!
So you just be grateful that your dad doesn't yell at you 2 4 hours a day!
And don't give me that look, because this isn't yelling!
When I yell, you'll know it!
Well, thanks.
Good talk.
Man, look at all this stuff.
I just realized how happy I am not to be a girl.
Well, that should have happened at a much younger age.
- How long was I out?
- Long enough.
You guys wanna get a burger?
Out in public?
Okay, I'll drive.
I'll buy.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Hey, hey.
Do you guys hear that?
That was me.
I had hot dogs for lunch.
Not that.
I'm talking about the sweet sound of no women.
-  - I never hear that.
Jackie's voice is burned into my brain.
I wish it would stop, but it won't.
Remember back in the day when it was just us guys?
That was good times.
More like desperate, ''I don't care if she has a mustache I'll take her anyway'' times.
You know what?
I say, who needs women?
Come on!
Let's get crazy.
What was that?
Did someone say mini golf?
I'm still not allowed back in there.
I mean, what's the point of having a windmill you can't ride?
We could go beer bowling.
That's always fun.
I am in, because beer makes you a better bowler.
That's a proven fact.
Wait.
Do I have to use the pink ladies' ball again?
Now, Fez, why do you ask that question when you already know the answer?
Pink ball only until I lose my virginity.
Sorry.
Them's the rules.
All right, fellas.
You know the rules.
You get a strike, you chug.
You get a gutter ball, you chug.
You get a 7-1 0 split seven to 1 0 chugs.
Hey, guys, look.
I got 1 0-pound balls.
Man, that joke never gets old.
Hey, guys, my balls have holes in them.
Now, why isn't that funny?
This is livin'.
A little bowling, a lot of beer, and just us guys.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Man, bowling-alley chicks are easy.
Hangin'out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We're all all right We're all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
!
Jill.
Glad you could make it.
Guys, this is Jill, the girl I told you about.
Oh, you're the one that hasn't put out yet.
Ay!
Nice to meet you.
You too.
So, who's up first?
- Me.
-  Can I be next?
Hey, buddy?
Hyde?
Buddy?
Can I talk to you for a second, buddy?
Hyde, what's goin' on?
I thought this was supposed to be guys' night.
Don't worry about it, man.
She's-She's cool.
She's like one of us.
In three beers, she'll be belchin' like a Kennedy.
This is ''guys' night only,'' man.
Yeah, I say out with the whore.
Hey, I'll buy the next round of beer.
The whore stays.
Okay, good night, you two.
Boy, thatJoanne- She's somethin', huh?
- Yeah, she's nice.
I like her.
- Good.
Good.
Me too.
Not that I'm ready to jump into anything.
I hate jumping.
Makes me jiggle.
But I won't like her if it bothers you 'cause I know you've had a tough time since your mom left.
No, Dad, I think it's nice that you have a friend.
- Really?
- Yeah.
I also think it's nice that you're bathing and shaving again.
Yeah.
That was a long eight weeks, wasn't it?
So long.
Boy, Kitty, you missed a great game.
The Bucks made a last-second shot and sent those Lakers home with their tails between their California fruitcake asses!
Go home, fruitcakes!
I've never seen old Pastor Dave so excited.
He swore at the referee.
''Son of a stitch.
'' I said, ''Son of a stitch.
'' Oh, well, I'm sure that fooled God.
Hey, Dave, the Celtics are in town tomorrow.
You up for it?
- I'm in!
- Oh.
Pastor Dave, tomorrow's Sunday.
You have church on Sunday.
Right, church.
Church, right.
Well,just get someone to sub for you.
Every Sunday I see six other guys up there in robes who only shake themselves awake when the wine comes out.
Any one of them could do your job.
Well, if God didn't want me to go to basketball he wouldn't have made foam fingers so much fun.
Check it out.
The hand of God is pointing at you.
Okay, see you at church.
Yes!
Another strike for Forman.
Man, is there anything better than bowling with the boys?
Yeah.
- Making out with a chick.
- Exactly.
But first- Hey, Kelso, there are words on my balls.
Let's go.
Fine.
Go.
But they're gonna miss the finest game of Wisconsin's ''Velvet Thumb.
'' Yes!
It's another strike!
You guys, I'm in some kind of beery zone.
All right.
That's it.
Hey,Jill?
Hey, thanks for stopping by.
Hyde, wipe your mouth.
Let's go.
I was gonna go home with Jill.
Well, we came together, Hyde so I kind of think we should leave together.
Fine.
Steven, call me later.
Forman, what the hell are you doing, man?
Me?
You spent all night making out with little Miss Can't-find-a-bra.
- Hey!
- Come on.
You made me the third wheel.
Who cares, man?
Her parents are out of town, and they got a water bed!
But you killed that dream.
I'm out of here.
But-You don't get to storm out, okay?
I storm out!
Hiya, princess.
Rhonda?
What are you doing here?
Waitin' for Fez, chompin' some cheese curls.
You know what?
Michael doesn't tell me where he goes either.
- I hate that.
- Kelso and Fez are on their way back from bowling.
They want to make out.
How'd you know all this?
Let's French, ladies!
Michael, she's in the loop!
Why am I not in the loop?
All right.
Look,Jackie.
I don't know what loop you're talking about but if she's already in it I don't think there's gonna be room for you too.
Donna.
Well, you're up early.
Surprisingly early.
You slept here?
Already?
You just met!
Listen, Donna, I'm gonna be honest with you.
Your father and I have started an intimate relationship.
And, you know, it's still a little awkward for us.
Emotionally, not physically.
Well, a little- I think I might be sick.
Look, I know this is a lot for you to take in right now.
But I think it would be better for all of us to just stop the charade and get it all out in the open.
Joanne!
When did you get here?
Oh, my God.
Oh, look at the time.
And on a personal note, I have an announcement to make.
I have always found happiness in serving the good people of Point Place.
But after talking to a dear friend I realized that church is just not where the party is, if you know what I mean.
So I'm resigning as your pastor thanks to my friend Red Forman.
Red, give the crowd a wave.
Well, if you weren't going to hell before, you're going first class now.
Go, Bucks!
Kelso, you should tellJackie where you go.
That way, when she wants to do it, she can find you and do it.
Boy, do I want to do it.
Fez, the foundation of every good relationship is three words: ''I don't know.
'' ''Where are you going?
'' ''I don't know.
'' ''What are you thinking about?
'' ''I don't know.
'' ''Who's that under you?
'' ''I don't know.
'' You see, it's bulletproof.
Why are you friends with him?
I don't know.
Hyde, what the hell?
What is she doing in my seat?
I don't know.
That's a good one, Kelso.
Just sit on the floor.
The floor?
Why don't I sit on the floor?
Visitors get the floor, all right?
And that's you, Terri Tube Top.
Oh, and by the way, it's winter!
You're a drag.
Okay, well, sayonara, Yoko.
What?
We're kind of the Beatles.
So it's just supposed to be guys' night out, right?
And in walks Hyde's skank of the week to wreck it all.
Years of friendship trumped by one pair of lopsided boobs.
Yeah, that's right.
I noticed, but I didn't say anything because I'm nice.
I had to talk to my dad's new girlfriend about the sex they had last night.
Yeah, okay, you win.
You know, at first, I thought it was great my dad had a friend.
But when I found out they were doin' it it took things to, like, a sick place, you know?
And it really made me realize that my mom is gone.
- Like, gone.
- Maybe you should say something.
No.
He's been through so much.
- I mean, I want him to be happy, you know?
- Yeah.
So Bob's sleeping with Joanne, huh?
God, am I, like, the only guy in Point Place who's not gettin' any?
Yes.
Yes, you are.
- And you think that's funny?
- Yes.
Yes, I do.
Well, Mrs. Candiotti just told me to shove a very holy book in a very unholy place.
Nice going, Red.
The whole church hates us now.
Kitty, I had nothing to do with Dave leaving the church.
You know, God works in mysterious ways.
- ''Let he who is without''- - Oh, can it.
Well, the torch-carrying mob will be here any minute.
Better turn on the light.
They won't need a light.
They've got torches.
Rhonda?
How'd you get in here?
I used my key.
Michael, why does she have a key and I don't?
Well, it's not because everyone doesn't want you to have one.
That's for sure.
- Don't sweat it, small stuff.
We're all part of the gang.
- Excuse me?
Uh, no.
I had to kiss butt for, like, a year to be part of this gang.
That was you being nice?
Good God!
She thinks she was being nice?
Look, all I know is you are not a part of this gang.
Really?
Well Snow White why don't we wrestle for it?
And if I win, I'm in.
Street rules.
No tap-outs.
- Okay, okay, you're in!
- Yea!
I'm in!
That's nice, but maybe you should wrestle her anyways.
Oh, yeah!
All right.
Shirts off!
.
Let's get it on!
Oh, good.
You're both here.
Look, I know you two are together and, Dad, I want you to be happy.
But I just don't think I'm ready for this.
Joanne!
When did you get here?
- Dad!
- Bob!
All right.
Donna, what do you want us to do?
- You want us to stop seeing each other?
- No.
No.
It's just that- Well, could you go back to lying to me?
I mean, that seemed to work.
I am always in favor of lying when it comes to children.
Bob, we were honest with Donna and now she's being honest with us.
We'll hold off on the overnight visits for a while.
Thank you.
Thanks.
That's really-Thanks.
Well, if you're not staying the night, we'd better get upstairs.
Oh, hey, Hyde.
Is that you?
I didn't recognize you without Skankarilla hanging off your face.
Are you still on this?
It's like having a wife.
Listen, don't flatter yourself.
I'd only marry someone who's nice to his friends.
Her friends.
Shut up.
The-The point is- Yeah, man, I get the point.
And you can drop it, all right?
She dumped me.
- What?
- Yeah.
She said she didn't like you.
I told her, ''Too bad.
We're friends.
'' And that was it.
Oh, man, I feel terrible.
Is there anything I can do?
I don't know, man.
I kind of really liked her.
Hey, how does 1 0 bucks sound?
Forman, 1 0 lousy bucks can't replaceJill.
Yeah.
How about 20?
Jill who?
Okay.
- Hey, Red.
- Dave, what's with you?
You don't just up and leave the church because I invited you to a basketball game on Sunday.
Red, you said it yourself.
There are six guys who would take my place.
No one would notice.
Sit down, Dave.
Let me tell you a little story about three bags of dog crap.
One on my front porch, one in my mailbox and one in the backseat of my car all from people who are so upset about losing you that they are willing to find, handle and bag dog crap.
Really?
My congregation has turned to vandalism and petty harassment on account of me?
I am truly blessed.
- Then you're staying?
- Yeah.
Good.
Now, come on.
Let's celebrate by returning those bags to their rightful owner.
Like it says in the Bible, ''As you sow, so shall you reap.
'' Jesus was talking about love, but it works for doggy doo, I think.
-Jill, what are you doing here?
- All right.
I confess.
'Twas me.
I asked Jill to meet us here.
Jill, Hyde's my friend.
That's no reason to break up with him.
What?
He broke up with me.
He said he had to spend time with you because of some brain inflammation that made you act like a dill-hole.
But I don't have a brain thing.
He forgets he has it.
It's part of the disease.
Why did you lie to me?
Yeah, and me.
Well, the thing is you like the Little River Band.
I mean, I- I can't be with a girl who likes the Little River Band.
Yeah, take that, missy!
And you!
You wouldn't shut up about me making out on guys' night which wouldn't have bothered you if you had a tongue stuck down your throat.
So for the love of God, man, find a tongue!
I do need a tongue.
Hey,Jill, I like the Little River Band.
You're both freaks!
Nice try.
- What are you guys doing here?
-Jackie and Rhonda are all mad at us.
We encourage one little topless girl fight.
And then all the sudden, we're the jerks.
- So let's bowl.
- Hey, guys, look.
I got 1 0-pound balls.
Hey, guys, my balls are black and blue.
- Good one.
- That's nice.
- That's funny.
- That was good.
My balls are finally funny.
No, no, no, no.
No tap-outs, you girl.
-  -  Yes!
We have a winner!
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
So, Eric, have you made your Christmas list for Santa yet?
Well, um, I was going to, but then I turned 1 0.
-  - Steven made his.
T-shirts.
Well, I guess I could ask for a cassette player for the Vista Cruiser like I have for the last 80 years.
But I won't get one, so I might as well just ask for a raincoat.
Oh, so you want a raincoat?
Man, remember when you used to come downstairs Christmas morning and you'd see your stocking over the fire all filled with toys?
Well, one year, I saw my mom's panty hose on the radiator and, uh, Uncle ''Strange Man'' sleeping on the floor.
He had a red nose though.
That's Christmassy.
Yeah, Christmas used to be so cool.
- Now it's just another day.
- Okay.
Okay.
It sounds like somebody needs a little holiday cheer.
I know!
You could direct the Christmas pageant at the church.
Hey, yeah, that's the worst idea I've ever heard!
Eric, you used to love that pageant when you were a little boy.
And you need some Christmas spirit.
And I already signed you up.
Well, it was fun when we were kids.
Then again, so was eating crayons.
Yeah, okay.
- I'll do it.
- Good.
Okay, now, Steven- No!
No!
Oh.
So you won't be in a show about how there was no room at the inn even though this innkeeper gave you a room?
Your guilt has no power over me!
I'll do it.
Fa la la la la La la la- boned  Hangin'out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We're all all right We're all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
!
Ho-ho-ho.
!
Guys, check this out.
It looks just like when we were kids.
And look, the wise-men gifts: gold, myrrh, and- Hyde, I think this one's yours.
That'd be my Baggie of frankincense.
Well, if it isn't Mr. First-time Director.
I thought I'd direct, but the church board whose average age is nearly dead feels that I don't speak to the younger generation.
Oh, Pastor Dave, I loved last year's Silent Night,Jazzy Night.
It was really funny.
It was a drama.
You guys, you guys!
Great news.
Rudolph, Santa Claus Is Coming to Town, The Little Drummer Boy- They're all on TV this week!
We can watch 'em!
Yeah!
We can wear our p.j.'s and eat gumdrops and drink Kool-Aid.
Hooray!
Yeah!
Okay, guys, let's talk about your parts.
Okay, Eric, I want to be the Virgin Mary.
See, she's pure and holy and rides a unicorn.
No,Jackie, she doesn't ride a unicorn.
She does now.
A white unicorn with speckles.
Write that down.
Hey, is there anyone in this show who just kind of lies there and does nothing?
Um, there's the baby in the manger.
I call baby in the manger!
Uh, Eric, I don't want to playJoseph as a carpenter.
Oh, how about if I play him as a spaceman?
Okay, uh, Kelso, I don't thinkJesus was the son of a spaceman.
Oh, really?
Well, where do you think God lives?
It's true, man.
-  - What the hell?
It's the Russians!
Aw, geez.
- Bob!
-   Hey there, hi there, ho-ho-ho there.
!
Bob, it's midnight.
Turn that crap off.
-  - What would I do that for?
Hey, check out the keister on Mrs. Claus.
-  - I know what I want for Christmas.
!
Bob, are you drunk?
I'm not sober.
!
Eric, I have a little problem with my part.
Um, it turns out you have me playing a wise man.
Why can't there be any wise women?
Yeah, okay.
I'll take that up with the guy who wrote the Bible.
Let me get back to you.
Okay, Kelso, you are now playing a wise man.
- Or a space wise man.
- Better.
Better.
How come the foreign guy has to play the shepherd?
I have never herded sheep in my life.
Well, once, as a favor.
Why can't I be a lifeguard?
Or a space lifeguard.
Then I could herd all the ladies into the pool.
''Into the pool, ladies!
'' Now, that's a good role.
Okay, uh, everyone?
Everybody?
Um, all of your ideas are all um, stupid.
Okay, moving on.
Uh, at the end of the play, when Santa comes in the door- - Ooh!
How about- - Kelso, I swear to God if you say Space Santa, I'm gonna kick you in the head.
Never mind.
Red, are you stealing Bob's Christmas decorations?
It's only stealing if you, uh- if you keep it.
I'm throwing all this crap away.
Oh, my God.
I'm married to the Grinch.
I'm Mrs. Grinch.
Well, as long as you're not Mrs. Tattletale, we'll be fine.
Leo, these guys are driving me crazy in there.
Do you know what they think is Christmassy?
Unicorns.
Right- No, I'm sorry.
Space unicorns.
Well, that's redundant.
Do you have any idea what this is gonna look like, man?
Shark!
Everybody out of the water!
And off with your tops!
Make way!
Virgin Mother coming through!
We come bearing gifts of frankincense, myrrh and Led Zeppelin IV.
Now, let me get a look at that cute little baby girl Jesus!
I'm just gonna go home.
Holiday Inn's on TV.
Now, that's Christmas.
You can't go home, man.
This pageant's your chance to spread some Christmas spirit, and that's contagious, like V.D. I just- I don't think I have it anymore, Leo.
Ah, don't be fooled, man.
V.D. comes back.
No, not- Okay.
Yeah, I'll watch for that.
So.
Dipping into the frankincense, I see.
Well, no more of that.
Okay?
We're gonna do this play the way it was meant to be done.
And no spacemen.
And anyone who doesn't like that is no Christmas friend of mine.
And we should be a little bit nicer to those of us who want to watch Christmas specials.
I mean, when Rudolph's nose shone so bright and Santa realized he could guide the sleigh at night- That was a great moment in American history.
Kelso, Rudolph was small, had a girlie voice and I'm pretty sure he was a little light in the hooves if you know what I mean.
Of course he was light in the hooves.
He could fly!
I would have guessed Prancer.
Well, you've all ignored me, so I'll take that as a resounding vote of confidence.
Guys, let's do this thing!
- What on God's green earth?
- But Pastor Dave, I was just- I know what you were doing.
I recognize that smell from the AC/DC concert.
I was handing out leaflets!
- No, but I wasn't- - Eric Forman, you're fired.
You know what?
Fine.
Rudolph had a girlfriend!
Her name was Clarice.
She thought he was cute.
Okay, if anyone was gay, it was that-that Hermey.
No straight elf has hair like that.
Well, as you may know by now, I had to let Eric go.
Wait, you fired Eric?
Who's gonna direct the play?
I guess that responsibility falls ''unto me.
'' And I am willing to be the reluctant hero on this year's pageant and whip all you ne'er-do-wells into shape.
Okay, kids, that was a good one.
Now, let's work on the scene where you untie me.
And action!
Give me my stuff back, Red!
Don't know what you're talking about, Bob.
And no!
Oh, Red,just give it back.
You don't want anybody to have a happy Christmas!
Oh, you want happy?
Drink another six-pack.
Oh, this is nice.
This is great.
I guess we have a new tradition here: the annual yuletide fight.
God, can't anybody just act decent for one freakin' day of the year?
Well, out of the mouths of babes, huh?
Well, fine.
Bob, your decorations are in the Dumpster behind the liquor store.
Thanks, Red.
If I had mistletoe, I'd kiss you.
Yeah, well, if I had ''mistlefoot,'' it'd be in your ass.
You know what I would like for Christmas?
No more talk about you putting your foot in other people's rear ends.
Maybe next year, Kitty.
Whoa, dudes.
What'd you do, man?
Leo, man.
We're just about to light the Dave.
I can't believe you guys.
You managed to bring a man of God to tears.
I'm not crying!
I'm talking about me, man.
You know, you guys can hassle your skinny friend, Eric but when it comes down to a fundamental moral core he's the only one of you that's got one.
So, congratulations.
You've ruined Christmas.
Oh, man.
Leo's right.
I mean, this probably isn't our finest hour.
I don't know.
It's pretty damn fine.
Well,Jackie, you know, since everything's ruined we could- I don't know- go home and watch Rudolph.
Michael, those shows are for babies.
But I want to watch it!
I wanna!
Grow up, Michael.
You never let me have any fun!
You guys, I feel kind of bad about Eric.
- Yeah, maybe we should go find him.
- Yeah.
Or we could stay here and wrap Dave.
- I say, get Eric!
- Come on.
Uh, guys?
Oh, right.
There you go.
Oh, honey, you looked so sad.
I am gonna let you open your big Christmas present early.
- Wow, it's kind of the size of- -  And it's kind of heavy like- - I knew you wanted one.
- I can't believe that you got me- a rain coat!
See, it's London Fog!
Did I fool you?
I put rocks in the bottom, so it would seem heavy.
- That's clever.
-  Okay, now.
I'm gonna wrap it back up.
You can open it Christmas morning and pretend you're surprised.
Uh-huh.
So, we got that to look forward to.
-  -  Okay!
Huh?
What's the matter, Kelso?
Rudolph, I can't watch you anymore.
- My friends say I'm too old.
- Ho-Ho-Hold the phone!
Too old for Christmas?
That's nonsense.
Yeah, but everyone's makin' fun of me.
You know, Kelso, people used to laugh and call me names.
''They wouldn't let poor Rudolph join in any reindeer games.
'' - So, what did you do?
- I kicked 'em in the face.
- Blitzen bled like a faucet.
-  Little Drummer Boy, what are you doing here?
- Come, they told me.
- No, but what am I supposed to do?
All my friends are gonna think that I'm a baby if I keep watching your shows.
Aw, screw those dumb-asses!
If they're too old for Christmas specials, that's their loss.
Can I go now?
I'm very cold.
Kelso, as long as you really, really believe in our magical world nothing in life can ever hurt you.
So, I can watch.
I can watch!
Whoo-hoo!
I can watch!
I can watch!
I can watch!
- Look at that face.
- What a nice kid.
- So happy.
I'm not too late.
I haven't missed them!
- Hey, Dave.
- Uh, Michael?
- A little help?
- Oh.
That wasn't fun.
One of the lights burned my neck.
You know, Pastor Dave, the only reason we mess with you is 'cause we like you.
You do?
You do!
I'm cool!
I'm cool!
Oh, well, if it isn't the dill-holes of Christmas past, present and future.
We came to talk to you about the pageant.
- Dave said he'll un-fire you.
- 'Cause I'm cool!
And we'll do the pageant however you want.
Yeah, I set 'em straight, man.
Look, Forman,just come on back, all right?
- Yeah, it'll be fun.
- Yeah.
We can all be together.
I mean, it's Christmas, you know?
Plus, we got you a present.
Oh, man.
A cassette deck.
You guys, thanks.
- So, you'll come back?
- Yeah, okay.
Ohh.
Merry Christmas, Charlie Brown!
-  -   - Hey, those decorations aren't half bad.
-   Look, it's snowing!
Yeah, I hooked up the snow machine.
Don't nobody smoke though.
This stuff might be toxic.
Ohh, a tape player.
Didn't know you wanted one of those!
Isn't it beautiful?
Hey, Steven.
Fix that light up there, will ya?
- Ah, I dropped my candy!
- Oh, no!
Oh!
Ah, my knee!
How's that?
Behold!
The virgin has given birth.
Isn't he cute?
He's got my eyes.
And my hair.
Hark, we come bearing gifts!
- Gifts from space!
- Kelso.
!
No!
Earth air!
Toxic!
Choking!
God bless us, everyone.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Hey.
L'Eggo my Eggo.
Hey.
L'Eggo my foot in your ass.
Oh.
Good morning.
Oh, here, honey.
I brought you something back from the hospital.
A lollipop.
Mom, I'm 1 7 years old.
Which is why I also brought you condoms.
Well, see, we had a teenage mom come in, and it's just- Well, you know, I worry about you.
That I'll get pregnant?
You're not a good nurse.
Now, don't be a porky mouth.
Oh.
Here.
Sexual health pamphlets.
I just want you to know that intercourse is a responsibility, not just a right.
Okay, well, this couldn't be more uncomfortable.
Oh, uh, don't forget your condoms.
I was wrong!
Hangin'out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We're all all right We're all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
!
Hey, man, Red's been spot-checking my room again.
I can't believe he still doesn't trust me.
You know, that really hurts, man.
I'm gonna need you to hide my stash.
Sure.
I'll put it in my dresser under my Hong Kong Phooey socks.
He can protect anything, because he's faster than the human eye!
You guys, the funniest thing just happened toJackie.
Michael, the most horrible thing just happened to me.
My father found out we're back together.
And if we don't break up, he'll never give me any money ever again.
Wait.
If you break up with Kelso, you'll be rich?
Talk about your win-win.
Hold on.
He didn't know we were dating?
Here comes the best part.
I mean the worst part.
My dad thinks you're a bad influence on me, so I kept our love a secret.
And now, I have to decide between you and money.
Gosh.
It's like Sophie's Choice for morons.
Hey, let's take a poll.
Who thinks Sophie should keep Kelso?
- The money?
- Ooh!
- You guys, this isn't a joke.
- But it's funny like a joke.
How do I choose between something that makes my whole life complete and you?
Well, I don't know, baby, but I love you.
Oh, Michael, I love you too.
Okay, I choose love.
I choose love!
Aw!
Yeah, aw!
Okay.
Now get a job, because I need a ton of money.
Guys, I would like you to meet Point Place's new foreign exchange student, Thomas.
- Hey.
- What's up?
Hello, pretty lady with eyes like the sea.
No.
Which sea?
Okay, easy there, Casa-new-guy.
I'm showing Thomas the ropes.
- Hello.
- What, are you crazy?
That's Nicole Mayzell.
She's way out of our league.
Oh.
Then we must be in different leagues because I just had sex with her last night.
Oh-ho-ho!
New foreign guy: uno.
Old foreign guy: nada.
This is outrageous!
The closest I have come to sex was when the football team pinned me down in the shower and made me kiss my own ass!
Hey, um, if you think that's close to sex then you're gonna be delighted with actual sex.
Yeah, Thomas, you should stay away from the football team for a while.
We wouldn't want a cutie like you to get hurt.
Oh, the football team loves me.
I'm their new placekicker!
What?
Oh, the room is spinning!
How did you do all this?
I have delightful accent.
So do I. Yes, but a nerd with an accent is still a nerd.
Now, good day, sir.
I say ''good day.
'' Now, good day.
- Good day.
- Good day.
- I said, good day!
- I said, good day!
- He stole that from me.
- But, Fez- I said, from me!
Oh, I'm out.
Out?
I am home one night this week, and you're out?
Hey, don't look at me.
You had a whole bag of'em, and you wasted 'em on Eric!
He's probably down there making balloon animals.
Well I guess we'll just sleep.
Well, couldn't we just, uh- You know, I mean, really, what are the chances?
We could have a change-of-life baby!
Oh, crap.
I'll be right back.
It's late.
We'll talk about this tomorrow.
Oh, my God.
My sock drawer.
I'm dead!
He found your stash!
Do you know what this means?
Yeah.
I get your room, and you get sent to military school.
Eric caught me stealing his things.
That's not funny.
I'm a grown man.
I don't go rummaging around in teenage boys' drawers - looking for things.
- Condoms.
That word is forbidden!
Okay.
Good night.
- Condoms.
- Quit it!
I don't know.
I've just always been good-looking.
Look at that foreign bastard cracking up the whores.
Checking the score.
Old foreign guy: nada.
New foreign guy: dos.
Hey, if I pretend to say something funny, will you laugh?
No.
That Thomas is shady.
But have you noticed he never says what country he's from?
What country are you from?
What country are you from?
America.
Fine.
Mystery solved.
Psst.
Mom.
- Is Dad around?
- No, I think he's upstairs.
Hot!
Hot, hot, hot, hot!
Love you, Mom.
Thanks for breakfast.
See ya tonight.
Bye.
Psst!
Kitty, Eric around?
No.
He just left.
Perfect!
Red, this is just silly.
You can't avoid Eric forever.
- I know that.
- Well, good.
I just have to avoid him till he goes to college.
What's that, like, a year?
I can do that.
Hey.
Michael, I'm broke.
I had to buy generic hair conditioner.
And now, I have split ends.
Oh, no one is gonna notice that, baby.
They'll all be looking at that monster zit.
I have to ration my cover-up.
So find a job already!
I'm tryin', okay?
It's tough out there.
I just had an interview at that new store in the mall, the Cheese Palace.
- Where curd is king?
- The very same.
They're hiring a new cheese maiden, you know, to hand out the samples.
- But I didn't get the job 'cause they want a girl.
- But you're pretty like a girl.
Thank you!
Man, but the manager wants an actual girl- you know, with boobs and stuff.
Hey, you know who's an actual girl with boobs and stuff?
Oh, Donna, you don't have to get a job just for me.
I was talking about you, pimple chin.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
I am not getting a job.
Ajob is for poor people.
I am a rich person who doesn't have money.
Big diff.
Hey, is that a blackhead?
No!
Cheddar?
Cheddar?
Cheddar?
Try the Swiss.
You can't miss.
Try the cheddar!
It's even better!
The floor's real shiny, and I see your heinie.
- Oh!
- Hey!
The cheese maiden hit me!
Cheese guards, seize her!
My God, this job is awful!
Are you sweating?
I mean, is work making you sweat?
No.
I'm glistening!
It's glisten!
Whatever it is-Yech!
Look, Michael the only reason I have this job is so that you and I can be together.
All you've done for our love is sit in a basement eating Fritos.
Well, for your information if I send in I get a free remote-control car which I was gonna give to you after I played with it only a little.
Now, that is love!
Thomas!
Thomas!
Thomas!
What I have to do is show everyone that I am cooler than Thomas.
You know, I once saw the Fonzie do something on TV that just might do the trick.
I am now going to jump over a shark on water skis to prove that I'm the coolest foreign exchange student in Point Place.
- He'll never make it.
- Shut up.
He can do it.
He's the Fez!
Okay, here I go.
Hit it!
- Oh!
- He's crazy, man!
- He's crazy!
- He's at the ramp!
Ay!
- Yes!
- Fez!
- Yeah, man!
You suck, Thomas!
Fez, you jumped that shark, and you're not even wet.
That's 'cause I'm cool-a-mundo.
Ay!
So, what do you think?
Not only is that the worst idea I've ever heard it was the worst moment in television history.
Yeah, you're right.
I stopped watching after that episode.
Thomas!
This is freaky, man.
Red hasn't said anything about the stash which can only mean he's gone to the much-feared stage: beyond yelling.
He's gone Darth Vader, man.
Or instead of Red snagging you maybe you snagged Red dipping into Hyde's stash!
I'm just sayin', everyone's tryin' it.
I guess Kelso's right.
Everyone is trying it.
I'm tellin' ya, this stuff isn't just for cakes.
It's great all by itself.
Mmm!
Wait, wait.
Watch this.
Look at me.
I'm Whipped-cream Head!
Fear me!
All fear Whipped-cream Head!
Mmm!
Kelso, that was delightful.
But the only part you left out is where Red kills me!
Forman, it was my stash.
I don't wanna leave you hangin'.
But I'm gonna.
So good luck in military school.
How exciting!
My first American road trip.
I can't wait to see Lake Dill-hole.
Well, the wait is over.
We're here.
Now, hop out, you crazy son of a gun.
This is the Michigan border.
- Well, what do you know.
- So where is Lake Dill-hole?
Oh, it's right there behind the Get Bent Memorial.
So get bent, dill-hole!
What's the score now?
Oh, here we go.
Fez: one.
Thomas: stranded in Michigan!
Oh, I kill me.
Nice job.
Thanks.
I learned from the best.
Thanks.
I would've taken his clothes.
That's why you're the king.
The Gouda's so good-a.
The Havarti's a party!
Hello, milady.
- ''Fondue'' you love me?
- Stop doing that!
All day with this.
''Hey, 'fondue' me.
'' ''Ooh, I stepped in 'fon-dog-due.
''' Oh, my God.
This is awful.
Michael, a few minutes ago, I smelled stinky cheese and it was me!
Look, I'm sorry.
I love you, but I can't do this.
You mean, you can't ''fondue'' it.
God, will you shut up!
Look, I am not cut out for work.
I'm cut out for having rich people give me things.
But you got a job for me.
I mean, doesn't that make you satisfied?
Oh, my gosh!
It's a check!
And that's my name!
Mine!
So we can stay together!
- Yeah, and I can still be rich!
- Yeah!
Well, if this isn't gonna go badly, I'm heading home.
No, wait.
Jackie deserves a celebration.
Hey, let's go buy me that remote-control car!
No, Michael.
Money doesn't grow on trees.
Money doesn't grow on trees!
You know, I think having a job is changing me.
Okay, think about it.
A whole new me.
That'd be great.
- I gotta- - I'm gonna- - Okay, enough!
You, sit.
You can't make me join the army, okay?
I'll cut off a toe!
- What?
- Okay, okay.
We are just gonna clear the air.
Right now.
Now, Eric, the other night your father and I were getting intimate  and we realized we didn't have any protection.
For hugging.
We just- We hug.
So your dad went to your room looking for one of those condoms I gave you and you caught him, and he has just been so embarrassed ever since.
Condoms?
Oh!
Condoms.
Yeah, condoms.
What did you think it was?
What did you think it was?
What did you do?
What did you do?
I-I didn't do anything.
Okay?
You stole condoms!
Get him, Mom.
- You're grounded.
- For a week.
Hyde too.
Whatever was in that drawer that you didn't want me to see, I'm sure it was his.
Fine.
No complaints here.
Thank you.
You suppose there was actually something in that drawer he didn't want us to see?
Who cares?
I know in orientation we talked about theft in the workplace so I would like to report a theft from my check.
Now, I don't know who FICA is but that bitch stole, like, 1 0% of my money.
Also, now, I don't know if you have this key in your typewriter but when I write ''Jackie,'' I like to dot my ''I'' with a smiley face.
Also, now, I put this in the suggestion box, but- You have something hanging from your nose.
Oh, and I want Saturday off.
Thank you.
Bye.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Hey, guys?
I'm thinking about getting a perm.
Hyde, can I get the number of your guy?
I don't have a ''guy,'' dumb-ass.
This righteous moss is a gift from God.
God gave me a perm, too, but he hit me below the belt.
What are you doing, Forman?
My stupid Cousin Penny from Florida is coming this weekend so my mom's making me clean the basement.
And I'm done.
- Penny?
- God, she was always such a tattletale.
''Eric's stealing cookies.
'' ''Eric's playing with fire.
'' ''Eric's touching himself.
'' Yeah, but Eric got her back.
He hit her with the old Ben Gay on the toothbrush and the over-the-shoulder wedgie and the butt-face gas attack.
- Butt-face gas attack?
- I'll show you later.
Thank you.
My favorite was when you trapped her in the revolving door at the library and kept spinning her.
Yeah, she ralphed and then she had to keep walking through the puddle.
'Cause it's a revolving door.
It spins in circles.
That's its nature.
It just- Hangin'out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We're all all right We're all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
!
- Penny!
- Aunt Kitty!
- It's so good to see you!
- Oh, my gosh, you have grown so- Things have- Good for you!
And good for us.
Oh, geez.
Penny.
You're so shiny.
I am just so excited you're here.
I have lots of free time these days, so I've gathered up some local foliage.
And I thought we could have a long talk while we make our own potpourri!
Well, thanks, Aunt Kitty, but right now I'd just like to catch up with Eric.
Find out how he got so foxy.
Okay, you boys be nice.
But not too nice.
Penny, I know your last trip here I was kind of a jerk, and- Oh, God, Eric!
That was so long ago.
Plus, I can't stay mad at you.
You're too cute.
- Hey, guys, what's up?
- Oh, hey, you remember my Cousin Penny?
Hey, Penny.
I didn't recognize you without Eric's butt in your face.
So, you guys ready for the movies?
You can come too.
I guess.
Thanks, but this Wisconsin air is so dry I really should go inside and moisturize before I lose my tan.
I have lotion.
I think the best plan is for all of us to go to the movies- except for me and Penny, who will stay here and moisturize each other.
What?
Screw that, I'm gonna moisturize too.
- Michael!
- I'll just do, like, a leg or something.
Fine!
Come on.
Let me show you to your room.
- Michael!
- I'm gettin' Kool-Aid!
Damn!
What losers!
Did you see them checking her out?
- Okay, she's not that hot.
- I never liked her.
You know, once when we were little she bit me, so I bit her back.
And then she said, ''Truce,'' so I said, ''Okay.
'' And then she bit me again.
Whore.
Slut.
- No, her.
- Oh, yeah.
Whore.
Yeah, we'll show Penny with our new sunlamp tans.
How dare she come into our town and try to ''out-hot'' us.
I know.
I mean, we don't go to her town and try and ''out-whore'' her.
Well, she can't just show up all hot, shaking her butt around our guys.
If our guys are gonna fantasize about moisturizing anybody, it should be us.
Right.
But we're not gonna let them do that, are we?
Let's just hope it doesn't come to that.
Have you seen that little stray cat that's been hanging around our house?
Oh, yeah, I met him this morning.
Then he met the hose.
Kitty, we don't need more things hanging around our house.
We already have Steven and Kelso and ''foreign kid.
'' Yeah, but they're always busy.
Maybe I should get my own cat.
I'm not working.
I'm home all day.
Here's my problem with cats.
Best-case scenario: You get the smartest cat in the world.
He still craps in your house.
Well, it's just, it would be nice to have something to take care of.
I'll tell you what, Kitty.
Instead of getting a cat, why don't we all just stop flushing?
It's the same thing!
Guys, I'm getting some weirdness from Cousin Penny.
Earlier, she gave me a hug, but this wasn't a cousin hug.
Our middles touched.
And not just for a second.
She pressed.
I've heard of''kissing cousins.
'' But have you ever heard of''doin' it cousins''?
'Cause that's what I think Forman should be shooting for here.
Kelso, I appreciate the advice, but your solution to every problem is ''do it with her.
'' Well, it worked with my old science teacher.
C-minus!
Well, unfortunately, Penny is my cousin.
That'd be like looking at my mom and thinking, ''Hey, baby, how''- I'm just gonna stop right there.
I've thought that about your mom, but I didn't stop right there.
Surprise!
This oughta keep you company during the week.
Roy's Pet Store?
Red, you got me a cat!
- Well, it's like a cat.
-  A fish?
Red, it's a fish.
See?
It's like a cat.
- They're both pets.
- No, they're not.
Pets are called ''pets'' because you pet them.
How do I pet this thing?
Well, you just reach in and corner it and give it a rub.
That's the thing about fish: They just love the feel of the human hand.
Jackie!
Jackie, wake up.
Oh, my God.
Donna, you're totally burned.
Really?
What have you done to me?
Me?
This was your stupid idea.
Did you call me ''stupid''?
- Ow!
- Ow!
- Lobster face!
- Ow!
Little Red Riding Bitch!
Oh, my God!
Okay!
Now, okay, let's just call a truce.
Fine.
- Ow!
- Ow!
-  - Ow!
Don't look at me.
Mrs. Paul killed these.
Here.
So must get pretty boring living in a fishbowl, huh?
Gets pretty boring around here too.
You know, I used to work at a hospital, and taking care of people-  It felt so good to be needed.
You know, like-like part of a team?
You know, people really depended on me, which I kind of miss.
Oh, at least I don't- I don't miss the bedpans.
Are you sure it's okay for me to do my yoga in here?
Do Aunt Kitty and Uncle Red allow girls in your room?
Well, you're my cousin, so you don't even really count as a girl.
You're like a rock.
A moving, talking, extremely limber rock.
Ooh, that's nice.
- Peterson's Auto Shop.
- What?
Peterson's Auto Shop.
That's what my T-shirt says.
I noticed you were trying to read it.
That's-Yes.
Yes, I was.
I, uh- I kinda have, like, a passion for T-shirt logos.
Okay, well, bedtime for this logo fan, okay?
Off you go.
Uh-oh.
Naughty thoughts a-brewin'.
Penny, you're cold.
Go get a sweatshirt.
Oh.
Okay, Uncle Red.
Eric, do I have to tell you to stop staring at your cousin?
Stop staring at your cousin.
Kitty, where's breakfast?
Honey, I'm-I'm running a little late.
I was, um, redecorating Fluffy's bowl.
Kitty, it's a stupid fish.
- What?
-  Cinnamon toast, get on it!
Oh, so, decided against the sweatshirt.
- It's a bold choice.
-  I saw Uncle Red leaving, and I wanted to talk to you alone.
See, I kind of have a crush on you.
Okay, Penny, okay.
Look, I don't know what the laws are down in Florida.
But up here, the cousin-lovin' is really frowned upon.
That's why I wanted to talk to you.
Last week, I overheard my parents talking, and I found out that I'm adopted.
So, technically, we're not even related.
Well, that's a twist.
And all those feelings that I had about you that would've been wrong?
Are pretty freakin' right!
- Bring it in.
-  Now you're warm and I don't feel bad about that.
So Penny's not even your cousin?
All right.
Well, in light of recent developments, I vote ''do it.
'' Do it, yellow belly!
Look, man, if you don't do it I'm gonna do it.
Then I'm gonna make fun of you.
All right, fellas.
I guess it's all systems go.
Just- Hey, let's keep this between us, okay?
- Hey, what's up?
-  - Forman wants to nail his cousin.
- No.
No, no, no, she's not my cousin.
She was adopted.
And what the hell happened to your face?
- What the hell happened to yours?
-  Burn!
Yeah, I gotta admit, Donna, that was a nice burn.
And I don't mean what you said just there.
I mean your face.
Nice burn.
Hey, if you ever need a date for prom, you can just flip through the family album.
-  - Oh, God.
You're just jealous because Penny is incredibly hot and you're a throbbing red pile.
Eric, my sunburn will fade, but your shame will last forever.
Yeah, well, at least my shame won't peel.
Hey, there's my girl.
New logo.
Nice.
I was just having a glass of milk before bed.
Oh, well, you know, you don't have to rush off.
Sit.
Come on.
Let's gab awhile.
-  - So let's get to the bottom of this crush, huh?
You know what I'd really love to do?
Stay up late and watch movies like we did when we were kids.
Remember?
All alone in the dark?
That's a good plan.
- And let's wear our jammies!
- Excellent addition to the plan.
Oh, but I usually just sleep in a T-shirt and panties.
Is that okay?
Well, so do I!
Er, I mean, you know, man-panties- Er- Underwear.
- You know what I meant.
- Great.
The movie starts at 1 1 :00.
- Don't be late.
- Okay, I won't.
''Man-panties''?
- Kitty?
What happened?
- Fluffy died.
Well, if it's any consolation, fish are never even really alive.
They're just less dead.
I know.
You know, he wasn't good company, but at least he was company.
-  - Red, I'm unhappy.
Oh!
I gotta go to the store.
I am a nurturer.
I am not gonna be satisfied nurturing something you'd win at a carnival.
Kitty, what do you want?
I'll get you anything you want.
Not a cat.
- I want to go back to the hospital to work.
- Oh.
As long as it's not a cat, I'm good.
Okay, I think what you mean is, ''I'm glad you're doing what makes you happy.
'' Oh, of course.
And I'm sorry that your fish died.
Don't be.
I flushed it.
Good evening, milady.
Well, we're all alone.
I told Hyde to amscray for a while.
So go ahead, take off your robe.
Penny, there's no rat- Don't, Eric!
Don't!
- No, I was- - Eric, step away from your cousin.
No, she's not my cousin.
She was adopted.
- I'm not adopted.
- Wh-What?
What?
She's lying!
Eric, I saw her mother give birth to her.
Now, what is going on?
I'm sleepwalking?
And I'm about to be ''sleepkicking'' your ass.
Eric, what kind of person would lie about something as serious as being adopted?
A liar who specializes in adoption lies: You.
A mean, vindictive person.
- Like someone who would trap someone in a revolving door?
- Yes!
Ohh.
Mom, Dad, can- can Penny and I be alone for a minute?
No!
I'm not raising any flipper grandkids.
No.
Look, I just want to apologize to Penny.
Fine.
When you're done, you head right upstairs.
I'm having Pastor Dave come over for an emergency house call.
I guess this will teach you to play pranks on innocent little girls.
This has taught me a lesson.
And that is that I'm not gonna rest until I get you back way worse than you got me!
Which by the way, wasn't really that bad!
Actually, it's pretty bad.
Cousin Penny went back home, huh?
Oh, wait, did I say cousin?
Yeah, I meant cousin.
Looks like that's two hot girls you can't have.
Well, thank you for such a conservative estimate.
- By the way, Donna, here's your copy of the pictures.
- Oh!
If you flip through 'em real fast, it looks like Eric's running.
-  - Gimme those.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Hey, guys.
It is literally a million degrees out.
I'm wearing shorts in January!
Have you ever seen prettier legs on a fella?
Michael, we'll admire your legs later.
Snow Prom is tomorrow.
We need to keep up our campaign for Snow Queen and Snow King.
Jackie, I did campaign.
I wrote our names all over the place.
Kelso, you peed in the snow.
In cursive!
It was awesome.
Okay, look, you may not take this seriously, but I do.
I used to be a rich, popular girl.
But now that my dad has cut me off, I'm not rich so I have to be twice as popular.
Okay, maybe you should spend less time worrying about being popular and more time being thoughtful, friendly, considerate.
Okay, can I get a translation because that was gibberish.
Come on, Michael.
Hey, you know what?
We should all go to Snow Prom together, in one car all of us hanging out, laughing, driving.
Whoo-hoo!
Good times.
You need a ride, don't you?
I so do.
Pick me up at the radio station.
All right.
We'll all go together.
Whoa.
Whoa.
Hyde, you're going to a school dance?
You're going to stink bomb the teachers' lounge, aren't you?
I want in!
No, man, kid stuff.
See, during the dance, I'm going to throw a party in Coach Ferguson's office.
I'm bringing my best stuff.
A party with your best stuff?
Are you saying what I think you're saying?
- You know it.
- Oh, boy, you have a pinata?
It's weird.
I feel like I'm forgetting something.
I've got my watch, my wallet, my who-am-I-kidding condom.
Yeah, sounds like you got everything, except for a tall redhead.
Yeah.
What man doesn't love a tall red- Oh, my God, Donna!
I forgot Donna.
Hangin'out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We're all all right We're all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
!
Mr. Hyde?
In school after hours?
What, are you trying to establish an alibi?
Coach Ferguson, shouldn't you be on the football field teaching boys to play with balls?
Don't push my buttons, wiseacre.
And there he goes.
I think now is a good time to go fumigate his office.
Oh.
I have exciting news for you two.
Michael, you have been elected Snow King.
Yeah!
And,Jackie, you are the new Snow Queen runner-up!
Oh, my God!
This is the happiest day of my life!
Wait, runner-up?
How could that be?
There's been a mistake!
It was fixed!
You poke me one more time, I'm gonna paddle you.
That'd be hot.
I-I have a serious announcement.
A tornado warning has been issued.
I'm told it's code red.
I don't know the codes, but red sounds serious.
Michael, this is my worst nightmare.
A tornado is your worst nightmare?
Mine's monsters.
How could I be runner-up?
If I'm not a rich, popular girl, I'm nothing.
I'm like Donna.
No,Jackie, you are the girlfriend to the Snow King.
Now, as Snow King, I must lead my people to safety.
All right, everyone!
Everyone, follow me!
Remain calm, people!
These are just sports balls!
Everyone grab a ball!
All right.
Now, I'm just so worried about Eric.
A tornado in January?
Yeah, life's full of surprises.
Like these two showing up 'cause they don't have a basement.
Surprise!
Gee, Red, you seem grouchy.
Surprise!
Red, if Eric gets caught in a tornado, he'll get blown to Canada.
He's very light.
Kitty, the gym is the town's bomb shelter.
He'll be fine.
I just hope he's not crying.
Everybody knows he's my kid.
Okay, you're right.
Eric's fine.
Let's just talk about something else.
Ooh!
You know,Joanne taught me a lot about lady orgasms.
They've been around longer than I thought.
Okay, so talking's bad.
I know, charades!
- No, thanks.
- What are you, chicken?
Did you just call me chicken?
That's it.
Move the couch, Kitty.
She's going down.
Oh, yeah.
Busted, hophead.
People of the make-out stairwell this is your Snow King speaking.
Boo!
Hit the lights, fool!
No, th-there's a tornado.
Everyone go to the gym.
The Snow King has spoken!
All right.
That's gross.
Who threw the retainer?
Oh, my God, Fez!
A tornado?
This changes everything.
This could be our last night here on earth.
Oh, no.
I'm going to die a virgin.
Not if I have anything to say about it.
You can talk all you want, but there's a tornado coming.
Fez, I mean, let's do it.
It?
''It'' it?
All right.
I'm going to need you.
- Eric, you're here!
- Donna, look, I'm sorry I'm late.
I really did want to pick you up before the dance.
So it's no big deal, really.
No big deal?
It's a huge deal.
I was in back filing records, and suddenly everyone was gone, and I was stuck here alone.
And you risked the tornado for me.
Tornado?
What tornado could stop me from helping you?
So, uh, tell me, um, is the tornado, like, um- like, out there?
Yeah.
They say it's a biggie.
- Oh.
- Eric, are you okay?
Sure.
Uh, it's just that now that I know you're okay I can finally start worrying about me.
And, see, the thing about me is I don't want to die.
So, what to do?
Let's see, there's you, there's me, candlelight.
You know, back in the old days we would have- - We're not doing that.
- Uh-huh, yeah, yeah.
So quick to dismiss the thing you once ached for.
You mean, cheese sticks?
If you want to call it that, sure.
Gyrating.
Ehh, twisting.
Uh- Hips!
You make me feel like hips!
Uh, time!
We win.
I was dancing!
''You make me feel like hips''?
It could have been a song.
Is it hard to lose, Red?
'Cause you make it look so easy.
You're in big trouble, bud.
You should suspend me.
I need a vacation.
A tornado's coming.
It's code red.
You know what that means.
I think it's serious.
-  - A tornado?
Deadly spirals of wind really freak me out.
- All right, Coach Girlie.
Calm down.
- I can't die yet!
There's so much I haven't experienced.
I bet I know one thing you haven't experienced.
Tornadoes get a bad rap, man.
It's not like the Wizard of Oz.
I mean, where are the midgets?
I bet I could bench, like, 1 0 midgets.
Hey, look at all the stuff you confiscated.
Mine.
Mine.
Ooh, la, la.
Mine now.
Why am I not Snow Queen?
For the last two weeks, I was nice to everybody.
Well, maybe not the A.V. Club, but I mean, come on.
Jackie, you can't just be nice for two weeks.
You have to be nice all the time.
Or very handsome.
Oh, my banana nose!
Oh.
I thought this was gone forever.
Ha.
It's still funny!
Maybe Donna was right.
Maybe being popular isn't as important as being nice to people.
I mean, I know that sounds wrong, but anything's possible.
Hey,Jackie, whatever makes you feel better about being a loser.
-  - Hey, watch the banana nose!
Hey, Hyde, when this is all over, you think we'll still be friends?
Well, my head says no, but my heart says no.
So, no.
I wonder what Donna and Forman are doing right now.
This is the best tornado ever!
I know!
And who better to be stuck here with than America's most beloved rock band ladies and gentlemen, Aerosmith!
Hey, as rock legends, we've had some pretty good times.
But it doesn't get any better than this.
Hello, Wisconsin!
Yeah, I dig this joint too.
Hello, Wisconsin.
That was your Aerosmith?
You're bad at that.
Steven Tyler is way cooler, and Joe Perry is so dreamy.
God, you're bad at that!
What?
That was dead-on!
Right, guys?
I bought it.
You, uh, really think I'm dreamy?
Whoa.
The station manager's stuff is way better than ours.
Well, I lived my dream.
Let's go.
Oh, wait.
We can't just leaveJackie here like that.
You're right.
Okay, we're good.
Oh, Toto.
Losing Snow Queen has left me searching for guidance.
Surely, the Wizard of Oz can help.
Oh, well,Jackie, why'd you make me the Scarecrow?
He needs a brain.
No.
No, I made you the Scarecrow because you love chasing birds.
- I do love chasing birds.
- Okay.
Is this some kind of joke, 'cause I'm not laughing.
Kelso's the Scarecrow?
Yeah.
Look, guys!
I'm a bear.
Fez, you're the Cowardly Lion.
But I want to be a bear.
- At least you got a brain.
- This sucks.
Oh, will everyone just shut up?
When it's your dream, you can be whatever you want.
I want to be a bear.
Jackie, what the hell?
She totally made you a witch.
That's so awesome!
She made you a flying monkey.
What?
Oh, crap!
- Let's kick her ass!
- Yeah.
Miss Wizard, I'm confused.
I lost Snow Queen.
And now I'm wondering if titles and popularity aren't as important as being a good person.
Well, how do you know when you're a good person?
- When everyone likes you, right?
When you're popular.
-  - And how do you know when you're popular?
- Oh, my God!
When you win titles like Snow Queen!
Winning titles and being a good person are the same thing.
So you go after that title, child.
Oh, I will, Miss Wizard.
I will.
And remember, if someone calls you shallow, they're just jealous.
Justjealous.
Jealous.
Jealous.
Ah, our own private stairwell.
This is exactly how I pictured losing my virginity except it was on a bed of flowers and there were two of you.
Tornado passed through, is heading to Illinois.
Kiss my ass, Chicago!
Oh, my God!
We're-We're safe.
Sex just doesn't seem important anymore.
I- I disagree.
And-And here's why.
Let's go celebrate with everyone.
Oh, you can make a tornado, but you can't let me do it?
No, you are not a just God!
Okay.
No six.
No six.
And - six!
-  - Look, Park Place.
- Ah, Park Place.
- Pay up.
- I told you we shouldn't spend all our money on Marvin Gardens.
Oh, and Baltic Avenue was such a help.
I bought that with my beauty-contest winnings.
Mmm.
Poor Red, losing again.
While we have this large housing development that I like to callJoanne Land.
Where's Red Land?
-  -  I'll tell you where it is.
It's right up your- -  - Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Shh.
This just in.
The National Weather Service has canceled the tornado warning.
And updating our top story, a local teen is in critical condition- Oh, game over.
Call it a tie.
A tie?
We had all the money.
So?
We had the get-out-of-jail-free card.
And you can't put a price on freedom.
Night, night.
Look,Jackie, I know you're upset and I don't know why you're not Snow Queen.
But I do know this: I am Snow King.
So that's pretty cool.
Michael, I'm not upset.
I just had the best dream.
And now I've got to campaign for next year.
Guys, how's my hair?
-  Yeah, it's fantastic.
-  Wonderful.
Wonderful.
This was fun.
We haven't just hung out in, like, forever.
Plus, you're, like, my hero.
Most guys would not risk a tornado for an ex-girlfriend.
Yeah.
Wow.
Yeah, well, I just wanted to kiss you before you found out that I went to the dance, forgot you and I didn't know about the tornado.
Okay, this was swell.
Wait, wait, wait.
So, you forgot me?
Okay, you're mad.
Actually, no.
I mean, if we were still dating, I'd be super pissed.
But we're not, so it's kind of funny.
You know what?
Let me buy you a burger.
I can't believe you totally snaked a kiss under false pretenses.
Yeah, I'm a little proud of that, yeah.
Well, I'm a lock for next year.
I introduced myself to everyone.
And I know they liked me, 'cause they laughed at everything I said.
I mean, I even shook hands with that nose-picking, chess-club guy.
Ooh, I'd better wash up.
- You ready?
- Yeah.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Extra!
Extra!
Read all about it!
"Skinny Dill-hole Talks Like an Idiot"?
Yeah, yeah.
I read it.
No.
Guess who was voted Point Place High's Most Eligible Viking?
Tommy Larkin?
Well, he is dreamy.
No.
Me, thank you very much.
Congratulations, Eric.
I guess this opens up a whole new world for you- one where you can actually date chicks.
And don't think I haven't already thought of that, my friend.
Bachelorina Number One I 've been diagnosed with a disease that makes me irresistible to women.
If you were my doctor, what would you do to treat me?
I'd order you to stay in bed for three weeks - with me.
-  Uh-oh.
I 'm feeling better already.
- Bachelorina Number Two?
- Well I 'd have you strip down for a complete physical.
-  - Well, then I guess we know what's up, Doc.
Number Three?
I 'd write you a prescription for love and tell you to take me three times a day.
Careful, I might O.D. Well, Eric it's time to choose.
Which one of these luscious, fawning chicks will it be?
Gosh, they all sound so great.
I can't decide.
Well, that's okay.
You're Point Place High's Most Eligible Viking.
You can have them all!
How tremendously fair!
Kelso, tell Eric what he gets.
-  - Bachelorina Number One is a hot cheerleader.
Bachelorina Number Two is a hot cheerleader.
Bachelorina Number Three is a hot gymnast who used to be a hot cheerleader.
Well, until next time this is Eric's jealous friend Hyde saying, "I wish I was Eric Forman".
' So long!
Forman, don't put me in your fantasies.
I don't even like being in your real life.
You can put me in your fantasies.
I don't mind.
I don't have a lot going on.
Hangin'out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We're all all right We're all all right Hello, Wisconsin!
Oh, hey, Donna.
Hey, um, did you see the school paper?
Oh, yeah.
Field hockey team 's going to state.
Whoo-hoo!
Uh-oh.
Looks like someone doesn't wanna talk about the new Most Eligible Viking.
Look, Donna, this whole, uh " Most Eligible" thing has really taught me something.
Um, I'm pretty.
So, what do you say llke, we officially start dating other people?
Oh, I've been waiting for your permission.
And can I stay out past 9:00, please, please?
As long as you're gonna be cool when you see me with one, two or seven of Point Place's juiciest tomatoes.
It's just like old times- Eric and Donna talking about meaningless crap that affects only them.
I've missed it so.
I have missed it.
I don't have a lot going on.
Hey, look here.
That '58 Corvette down at the used-car lot is still for sale.
Oh, and look here.
That diamond bracelet down at the mall is still for sale.
Hey, Red, get this.
A while back, I'm in my car crying, 'cause Midgie was gone and I kept having to reach into the glove box for tissues.
Oh, that's dangerous.
One time I had to blow my nose.
Nearly hit that cockeyed girl down the street.
I could've sworn she was lookin' right at me.
So I attached a box of tissues to the sun visor sold the idea for a bundle, and voila.
The Weeper Keeper was born.
Oh, God.
Are you rich again?
Yep.
I'm back to my I-can-buy-anything-I-want former self.
Just picked up two sombreros and a case of Lik-m-aid.
Where are you gonna wear a sombrero, Bob?
Where won't I wear it?
Okay, you guys, which one of these lucky ladies gets to go out with Point Place High's Most Eligible Viking?
Start with the gymnastics team, but go with the second string- just as limber and somethin' to prove.
- How about her?
- Yeah, I made out with her once.
Okay, I don't want my tongue where Kelso's tongue has been.
Oh, you better stay away from your mom then.
I was kidding!
- What about her?
- Hey, I know her, man.
She's not all there, if you know what I mean.
- She's a space case, huh?
- No, she's missing a toe.
Oh, you guys.
There's that girl Emily.
Problem solved.
Excuse me, fellas.
- Hey, Emily.
- Oh, hi, Eric.
- I saw your name in the paper.
- God, that totally slipped my mind - although I think I have a copy right here.
-  Look at him.
Donna, you have to start dating, or you're gonna look pathetic.
And I'm gonna look pathetic for being seen with you.
I know.
I 'll set you up.
Uh-uh.
Mm-mmm.
- Okay, if you don't wanna do this, just say so.
- I don't wanna do it.
Oh, you don't know what you want.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Rhonda just said she has something special to share with me tomorrow night.
It can only mean that we're going to do it!
No, no, no.
Listen to me.
I need a place to do it- roomy and cheap.
Just like my Rhonda.
You can use the Fotohut, man.
I'm always happy to lend it out for deflowering and bar mitzvahs.
Thank you, Leo.
Tomorrow night, Fez becomes a man.
Oh, so it is a bar mitzvah.
Well, Bob, thanks for insisting on coming along.
So, Red, what's so special about this thing?
It's barely got a trunk.
Where do you put the groceries?
This car isn't about groceries.
It's about freedom.
Speaking of freedom, they got free doughnuts.
-  -  So long, dumb-ass!
-  -  - Hey, Red.
- Hey.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, there's plenty of leg room in here.
Oh.
Glad you like it.
I just bought it.
You what?
Yeah, I'm pickin' it up tomorrow.
Sure hope that trunk will hold my sombreros.
Oh, is it my turn?
Oh, funny, 'cause tonight is also my turn- Ah!
To do it.
Guess what, Eric?
Donna has a date tonight too.
Yep, yep, yep.
Mm-hmm.
I set her up with Michael's older brother, Casey.
Oh, man, Donna's going out with Casey Keiso?
Casey "What's the big deal?
It's just a misdemeanor" Kelso?
Man, that's gonna be the best bad date ever.
Hey, we should hide in the trunk.
Oh, like Sprytle and Chimchim!
Oh, my God.
I would pay to see that date.
Oh, uh-  "So, Casey what are your thoughts on feminism"?
"Well, Donna, I think it can munch my butt".
' - Oh.
-  All right.
Hey.
My brother's not that bad, okay?
He taught us lot of good, useful stuff about chicks llke, the bigger the boobs, the smaller the brain.
That's a timeless truth.
I'll tell you another timeless truth.
I'm going to do it!
I don't know why I let you set me up with Casey Kelso.
From what I remember, he's, like, a Kelso.
-  -  Ooh, he's here.
Okay, come on.
Try to look pretty.
That's it?
That's all I get is a honk?
What kind of a jerk won't even come to the door?
Oh, my God.
Casey?
Hey, Pinciotti.
Man, you really grew into those legs.
Yeah.
And you- Your arms seem bigger.
You-  - So you ready to roll?
- Roll?
I 'm ready.
- We're gonna roll.
-    Fez, honey, what are you- Did you come for cake?
No, I- Do you have cake?
No, no, no.
I came- I came here because I have this friend.
Oh, really?
What's his name?
Name?
Uh Johnny Table.
And what's Johnny Table's problem?
Well, he and his girlfriend are about to do something very special for the first time.
You mean, they're going to engage in- Putt-putt.
They are going- They're going to putt-putt.
And-And-And she has putted around quite a bit.
But-But he is a virgin, uh, putter- a-a virgin putter.
- He has never putted.
- I see.
And my friend, uh- Ay.
-Johnny Table?
- Yes.
Um, he cannot talk to Eric or Kelso or Hyde because they make fun of me- him-Johnny Table.
So he's coming to you.
Well, honey, you tell Johnny Table to be respectful and wear a condom.
- Thankyou, Mrs. Forman.
That's good advice.
- Mm-hmm.
- So, um, may I have my piece of cake now?
- Mm-hmm.
And one forJohnny Table.
So when my dad saw that I had broken the TV with the bowling ball, I said - "You fix it, dumb-ass".
' -  Ah, it shut him up.
You know, Eric, I've had a crush on you for so long.
Well, since the paper came out.
Oh, right, the Most Eligible Viking.
Well, that's just good reporting.
-  - I can't believe you're Kelso's brother.
I mean, you're nothing like him.
'Cause he's, like- And you're all- - Hey, you want a cold one?
- Okay.
Thanks.
This is fun.
I've been spending, like, way too much time worrying about my mom and stuff.
Hey, I learned something in the army.
When things are tough turn up the music and crack open another beer.
Yeah, you mean, like, things will eventually get better?
I don't know about that.
But if they don't, at least you'll have a beer.
Red, guess what?
I went down to pay for my Corvette, and some jerk-wad bought it out from under me.
Oh.
Well, that's a tough break, Bob.
But you know what would make you feel better?
A iook at my new Corvette.
Oh, my goodness, it's beautiful.
You bought my car?
That doesn't make me feel better, Red.
I 'm sorry.
Did I say make you feel better?
I meant make me feel better.
Leo, thanks for letting me use the Fotohut for my date with Rhonda.
And when I say date, I mean-  Do it!
- Hi, Fez.
- Rhonda, you look beautiful.
Well, I'll leave you two with the same advice my father gave me: "Get a job, dopehead".
' So, here we are.
You know, Fez, I 've been with a lot of guys.
You're more special than any of them.
Now, I 've cleared a space right over here- And-And because I care about you and about us I wanna wait.
Wait?
Rhonda, hear me now: Things are turning blue.
But- But-But, Fez, I love ya.
But- But!
Oh, I love you too.
- Really?
- Yes, damn it.
So, if you want to wait, we'll wait.
Ah, come here, Cocoa Puff.
Yeah, this is nice.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go sit in the snow.
So, anyway, I just turn to my dad and I say - "Yes, I am some sort of wiseass".
' -  - Well, shut him up.
-  Anyway, this was fun.
- Call me?
- Okay.
-  - Hey, Emily!
- On the phone, silly.
- All right.
I am silly.
Hey, Foreplay, is that you?
"Foreplay".
' I forgot about that.
- Come here, little guy.
- Okay, all right.
Okay, all right.
Good to see you.
Okay.
Okay, all right.
Okay.
Okay.
Man, you haven't changed a bit.
You still got that haircut, huh?
No.
So, uh, they let you out of the army, huh?
Yeah.
It was kinda like they were always tryin' to tell me what to do.
Hey, uh, Pinciotti tells me you and her used to go out, but you dumped her.
Well, yeah.
But it was kind of complicated with the ring.
- And we talked, but she- - Yeah, it's a great story.
- Anyhow, I'll see you around, Pinciotti.
- Okay.
You too, Foreplay.
Yeah, okay.
Ooh, Casey Kelso, huh?
Better luck next time.
No, actually, I think I might go out with him again.
Okay!
What- Okay.
But, um, I have just two words for you: Donna Kelso.
See ya.
What- No!
But think of the children!
Little redheaded morons.
They'd have to go to special schools.
It'd be expensive.
Donna and Casey?
He's a Kelso!
Behold, my friends.
Your lovable foreign exchange student Fez has done it with a woman.
Fine.
I'm still a virgin!
You forced it out of me.
Stop looking at me!
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Guys, look what I got for Big Rhonda.
Oh, it's so nice to have a girlfriend on Valentine's Day.
Yeah, it definitely increases the chance of gettin' your fun stuff touched.
Well, sorry, fun stuff.
Looks like it's just you and me this year.
Unless- - Sorry, fun stuff.
- Yeah.
Oh, Rhonda's going to love these.
I just have to not eat them until Valentine's Day.
- But you love candy.
- Some would say it's an unnatural love.
Yes, I do love candy.
But I love Rhonda more.
Really?
'Cause there's three pieces missing.
Fine.
I love her the same.
Hi, sweetie.
How was work?
I am so exhausted.
Yeah, the commute from Austria must be a real bitch.
A bus full of old people stopped by the Cheese Palace.
And when they saw free samples, all hell broke loose.
But the good news is I got paid!
Oh, that's great.
'Cause Valentine's Day's coming up, and I need you to give me money and tell me whatever foo-foo crap gift you want to get.
Michael, I'm not doing that again.
Last year I gave you money, and you bought a bag of plastic dinosaurs.
For you!
Look, you need to make some cash and buy me something nice because I worked way too hard for my money, and you're not gettin' any.
Oh, I smell like hickory.
Oh, this bites.
Hey, Fez, how's it going with not eating the candy?
Fine, thank you.
Hangin'out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We're all all right We're all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
!
Oh, my God.
Casey Kelso's here.
What?
Oh, my God.
He is so fine.
You know, if you marry Casey and I marry Michael we'll be like sisters.
Yea!
Okay, go talk to him.
- I don't know.
- I want to go baby shopping with you.
Now go!
All right.
Shut up.
Oh, my God.
Casey.
Hey, Pinciotti.
How you been?
Love the jeans.
Really?
They're blue.
Um so what have you, like, you know, been up to?
I'm working part-time for the railroad.
They leave a lot of stuff unlocked.
You need any Cheerios or rebar?
- No, I'm good.
Thanks.
- Right on.
Well, listen, I'll give you a call sometime, but right now I gotta go see a guy.
He's got a leather steering-wheel cover.
Oh, yeah.
For the Trans Am.
Yeah.
I was thinkin' about using my G.I. Bill for college but, uh, Trans Ams just kick so much ass.
I love the Trans Am!
Everybody does.
- See ya.
- Okay, bye.
- He's gonna call me.
- You gave him your number?
Of course I didn't.
Damn it!
Oh, that's okay.
Kelsos never call.
They're like dogs.
They're cute, but they can't work a phone.
Hey,Jackie.
I thought about what you said about making money so I can get you a Valentine's Day gift, right?
And then I realized that it'd mean a lot more if I gave you something that I crafted with my own two loving hands.
Oh, my God!
It's horrible!
No, it's an address rock.
You put it on your lawn.
Happy Valentine's Day, my love.
Michael, a rock is not a romantic gift.
And that's not even my address.
That's my address.
No, it isn't.
That's my dad's address rock!
No, it isn't!
Hey, Dad.
You want this?
Thanks, Son.
I love you.
I'm sorry.
What?
I love you.
I really do.
Yeah.
Yeah.
-  - Donna!
What are you doing at my house?
Nothing.
I just thought I'd come by and see what you were up to.
Oh, you're here to see Casey, aren't you?
Casey, your lover's here!
You love my brother!
You're gonna do it with- Ow!
Mom!
- Thank you.
- No problem.
Spaz face.
!
- Hey, there.
- Hey.
Um, you were gonna call me, and I remember I never, like, gave you my number.
So, anyway, here's my number.
You know, I was gonna get that from you tomorrow night when we go out.
- We're going out?
- Yeah.
I'll pick you up at The Hub after school.
I'll be in the Trans Am.
I love the Trans Am!
Everybody does.
Later, Pinciotti.
Pinciotti.
Mom, was Dad abducted by aliens and replaced by an identical creature programmed to love?
Honey, this is breakfast.
Don't ask me things.
He told me he loved me.
Your father?
No!
Yeah.
I think I know what happened.
I gave your father an early Valentine's Day card that said what a wonderful husband and father he is and it rhymed, and maybe it touched him.
It didn't look like it touched him.
He just- He got up and got a beer.
But maybe deep down- deep, deep, deep down- something woke up.
I am so glad he loves you.
Yeah, but, Mom, this is weird.
He's never said that.
Ever.
One time I saved him from getting hit by a lumber truck and I think he was about to say it, but then he said ''Get in the car.
'' But how am I supposed to handle this?
You think I should say it back?
He's gonna hit me.
Maybe not.
I can't believe thatJackie wants me to get a job.
I mean, my plan has always been to coast through life on my good looks.
I mean, look at me!
It's like I was chiseled out of marble.
Okay, you guys, here goes.
Dad, I love you.
I love you, Pop.
Poppy?
Pappy?
Daddy?
No.
Oh, I have to- I have to stop eating Rhonda's chocolates.
Oh, it's hopeless.
Kelso, if you need to make some quick cash,just sell your blood.
And you!
You've had enough of this!
No, I can stop anytime I want.
I am not selling blood.
There's no way that anything inside of my body is comin' out for cash.
Well, that's too bad, Kelso, 'cause I hear there's this clinic in Madison that'll pay you for your, um, manly donations.
Manly donations?
No way!
They'll pay you for that?
Well, I'll do that.
I'm good at that.
''Do you have any serious medical conditions?
'' Puked after Crunch Berry eating contest.
- You know what?
I'll just finish that for you.
- Thank you.
Now, Mr. Chang you'll be in room two.
Some of our clients prefer a magazine.
Would you like one?
Nah.
Farrah was on Carson last night.
I should be good to go.
Okay, so I was in the kitchen and Red came in, and I was gonna tell him I loved him.
But, uh, then he said if my hair got any longer he was gonna buy me a pair of boobs, so- Yeah, you're in a tough spot.
But just know I'm here for you, 'cause I love you.
You know what would make Forman feel better?
A piece of that candy.
No, no, no.
There's only nine left.
I will guard them with my life.
Hyde!
Eric!
Fez!
Easiest money I ever made.
They paid me 50 bucks for my underpants navy.
You mean your corduroy commandos?
Yeah, your team from the inseam?
Your Battle-pants Galactica?
- Battle-pants Galactica.
Nice one.
Wow.
- It just came to me.
Thank you.
Man, this job is the greatest.
It combines all my interests, hobbies and skills into one moneymaking endeavor.
I'm gonna getJackie a sweet gift.
Popcorn?
- Dude!
- Oh, forget it!
All right, Kelso.
Where the hell is your moron brother?
He was supposed to meet me at The Hub, and he totally blew me off.
Whoa.
A Kelso blew you off?
Oh, my God.
What a shock.
Oh, hey, Colonel Mustard called.
He said get a clue.
What is wrong with you Kelsos?
Did all of you get dropped on your heads?
You know, if you're mad at Casey, why don't you go yell at him?
I'm too tired from working all day to argue.
Oh, to be a working stiff.
So, Red, you big, old softy.
Did anything special happen yesterday?
Special?
Well, let's see.
The dentist called with a cancellation, so I went in and the sadistic son of a bitch found a cavity.
The next thing I know, I'm hopped up on drugs and he's taking a jackhammer to my jaw.
I spent the rest of the day in a fog.
Oh, no.
Oh, my God.
You don't remember what you said to Eric?
Kitty, I don't even remember how I got home.
All right, Dad.
Look, I tried to figure out the right words and then I realized I just gotta say it, so- - Wait, Eric- - Mom, please.
Dad, I-  Stop!
He was drugged!
love you.
Go to your room.
Rhonda is going to be so disappointed.
All that remains is one lonely candy.
Look!
More candies!
It's a Valentine's Day miracle!
Oh, candy you've got me under your spell!
Jackie, I couldn't wait till Valentine's Day.
So here.
Oh, my God, Michael!
These earrings are gorgeous!
Big day at the office?
Yeah, I worked a double shift.
Wai-Wait.
You got a job?
Michael, I am so proud of you.
Well, now, if it wasn't for you pushing me I would've never realized how good it feels to roll up my sleeves, get a little sweaty and earn some cash.
Oh, this is so exciting!
I can't wait to come visit you at work.
That'll speed things up.
What's he talking about?
Oh.
I've been selling my love nectar.
What?
Michael, you can't do that.
You're hot.
Women are gonna want to take your little Kelsos home.
My God, she's right.
Think about it- a world full of Kelsos.
Libraries will fall into disrepair.
There'll be feathered hair as far as the eye can see.
We'll have to put padding on every sharp corner!
Hey, those sharp corners can be hazardous, man.
I mean, come on.
It's 1 97 8!
Things should be round by now!
-  - Hey!
Hey, Casey!
Hey, Pinciotti.
What the hell happened to you?
I was waiting at The Hub?
Oh, man.
See, the thing is, when I went to go pick up the steering-wheel cover the Trans Am was running kind of rough, so I thought I'd rebuild the carburetor.
But I was waiting at The Hub.
Well, you want a smooth ride, don't you?
I just think that if you say you're gonna be someplace that you should be there.
Aw, man, I guess I flaked.
I've just got this thing where a lot of times I don't show up.
I don't know what to do about it.
How about showing up?
I guess I could give that a shot.
So this will never happen again?
No, I'm pretty sure it'll happen again.
But we'll light that firecracker when we come to it.
Fair enough.
I can't believe this.
When I got here, I was so mad at you and I already totally forgave you.
Yeah.
Everybody does.
I'm sorry, miss, but I can't give it to you.
The donor himself is the only one who has legal rights over the specimen.
Fine!
Michael, you get them!
You're the only one who has rights over your ''special men.
'' Jackie, what do you care what I do with my special men?
Specimen.
I said, specimen.
I care because if there are gonna be any little Kelso babies well, I want them to be ours.
Oh.
You want to have my children?
Well, yeah.
I mean, if you get rich and don't lose your hair.
Because I love you.
I love you too.
You can't do that here.
Oh, she's right.
We'll be in room two.
- Dad?
- Oh, crap.
I was hoping that you wouldn't find me back here.
Well, that's a good icebreaker.
Look, um about the ''love'' incident- All right.
Stop right there.
There are only a few times in life when it's acceptable for a man to use that phrase- when he's drunk, when he's dying or when he's in big trouble and that's the only way out.
Which usually means he's drunk.
So, other than that- Other than that, it's just a given.
Oh.
Hey, you just kind of told me- No, I didn't.
Yes, you did.
Well, I'm drunk.
Clearly I'm drunk.
Daddy, be my valentine.
Do I have to hit you?
Go to your room.
All right.
Good news.
My boys are back in friendly hands.
Ironically, that's just where they started their journey.
That's a shame, Kelso.
It's the one job I knew you could've been a success at.
Thanks, Hyde.
Kelso, get that nasty bag of genetics out of my basement.
- This bag?
-  Burn!
It's just a big bag of candy.
Candy?
What kind of candy?
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Hey, you guys!
Great news!
I was walking around Halverson's Department Store and the owner comes right up to me, and he offered me a modeling job.
Yeah.
Whoo!
Wait, wait.
He just offered you a modeling job?
Yeah, sounds a little suspicious.
I mean, how do you know it was the owner?
Because it was Mr. Halverson.
How do you know it was Mr. Halverson?
Because I said, ''Aren't you Mr. Halverson?
'' And he said, ''Yeah.
'' - Hey, Hyde, aren't you Mr. Halverson?
- Yeah.
See?
Look, Michael.
I've been in that store over a hundred times and Mr. Halverson never asked me to be a model.
And if Mr. Halverson never asked me to be a model then there's no Mr. Halverson.
It's a scam.
I don't know.
It doesn't sound like a scam to me.
- Thank you, Donna.
- Sounds like Mr. Halverson wants you for his lover.
Either way, I'm flattered.
Hyde, will you teach me how to drive the El Camino?
Rhonda's car is a stick and until I learn to drive it I have to sit in the lady seat.
No way, man.
The Camino's cherry.
- Please?
- No.
Please, please, please?
No.
Please, please, please, please, please, please please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please.
Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please please, please, please, please, please, please - please, please, please, please, please, please, pl- - All right!
All right!
You can use the El Camino.
But you have to be careful, all right?
I don't want anything to happen to my baby.
Aw, thanks for your concern, Hyde, but I'll be fine.
And let out the clutch gently, okay?
- 'Cause this car's very powerful.
- Hyde!
We've been sitting here for half an hour.
Will you just shut your hole and let me drive?
Okay, you're clear.
-  -  In front of you.
Man, I picked a bad place to take a nap.
Hangin'out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We're all all right We're all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
!
Hey, Todd, I'm gonna take my break now.
- Michael's stopping by.
- Still dating that guy?
I guess that's fine if you like the handsome type.
But does he have a picture of himself with the guy who played Chewbacca?
'Cause I do.
Hey,Jackie!
More great modeling news.
They're startin' me in underwear.
Look, I got a W-4 and a body-waxing kit and everything.
Oh.
So you're really an underwear model?
No, not just underwear- briefs.
I mean, usually, you have to spend a year cutting your teeth in boxers before you even get into the tight stuff.
You know what?
I don't have time for this right now.
It just isn't important.
- But,Jackie- - Hey, maybe you didn't hear the lady.
She's busy.
So hit the road, guy.
I'm her boyfriend, guy.
Nuh-uh.
When she works here her boyfriend is every man, woman and child that walks in here for cheese.
Well, I don't have any money for cheese.
But I'm going to go get some, and then we'll see whose boyfriend is whose.
Let me tell you something,Jackie.
As a roving associate junior manager for Cheese Palace, Incorporated I've seen a lot of things- some I can't talk about.
But I will tell you two things.
One: With the German population that this town has we should be moving a lot more sausage.
Two: You're a stone-cold fox.
I've said too much.
I'll be in the cooler.
Now, if your gown falls open again there's no need to ring the little buzzer.
You can just cover up by yourself.
Okay, um, I'll be right back with your ''blankie.
'' - ''Thankie.
'' -  Leo, I'm so sorry I hurt you.
Ah, that's all right, man.
I'll be fine.
Least I still got it all up here.
But that's just good genes, man.
My father had a good hairline too.
Well, nice job, Fez.
The fender's dented, the taillight's shot, so you owe me 80 bucks.
Okay, good luck with that.
- I'm broke.
- Well, like my mom used to tell me ''Shut up and give me some money.
'' Hey, you guys, I was just next door and you know that weird kid from school who's always saying he can fly?
Yeah, he can't.
So, Leo, how's the hospital?
Oh, it's great, man.
Cable TV, free parking don't have to get out of bed to take a pee.
It's just like a hotel.
And Nurse Kitty and I have had some good times.
Okay, Leo, I'm going to get you a surprise dessert.
It jiggles and it rhymes with ''jerry chello.
'' I love you too, Kitty.
I love you too.
Hey, Eric, um, where's Donna?
Oh, she's out with Kelso's brother.
Which means it's only a matter of time before she calls us from the holding cell.
Well, I need a woman's opinion.
Eh, you're close enough.
Look.
I'm just really upset about Michael modeling.
I mean, that was our dream together.
But for me!
Wait, so, um, in your dream you're a model, and Kelso's, um, not there.
Whereas in real life, Kelso's a model and you, um, sell cheese.
That is delightful.
Hey, Red.
Could you give these to your wife, please?
And tell her I love her.
I'll give her the message.
Thank you.
Oh, boy!
You got a date for the Stoners' Ball.
''Roses are red.
Violets are blue.
Milk, eggs, coffee.
'' Who's the most handsome man on earth?
U-R.
Michael, I've thought about your modeling job, and I came to a decision.
I can't let you take your pants off in public.
But I take my pants off in public all the time.
You never said anything before.
Because before you weren't doing it for your glamorous new career.
You were doing it for the love of being pantsless.
So, now promise me you won't do it.
- Michael?
- Fine.
I ''plomise.
'' I heard that.
You said, ''I plomise.
'' There is no ''L'' in promise.
Michael, promise me with an ''R.
''  Fine!
I pr-o-o-mise.
Okay, you promise to what?
I promise I won't model my ''undelwear.
'' Michael!
Oh, fine!
That jerk.
He really is a jerk.
And you smell nice.
So?
Does it make you wanna buy underwear?
- No, it makes me wonder who this guy is you're massaging.
-  That's Daryl.
I'm not massaging.
It's posing.
Shut up.
God, he's got a girlfriend.
I've got a girlfriend.
Yeah, and her name is Daryl.
Hey, Fez.
Got that 80 bucks yet for the El Camino?
As a matter of fact, I do happen to not have it yet.
Well, why don't I hold on to this until you do.
My candy.
You'll get your 80 bucks in hell!
Hey,Jackie, how's it going?
You know, Michael, not so good.
You lied to me and you stole my dream.
How's it going besides that?
You knew I always wanted to be a model and you took the job anyways.
I mean, if Mr. Halverson had offered me a job as a spaceman I would have said no, 'cause that's your dream.
I thought that out of everyone that you would be the one to be happy for me, 'cause you're supposed to love me.
Well, if that's what you expected from me then obviously you don't know me very well.
Okay.
Well, when you're ready to apologize I'll be downstairs modeling stuff.
But, Michael!
Damn!
Man, if I was your boyfriend I'd be giving up modeling for you, and then taking it back up again just so I could give it up again.
Well, I'm off to the Fotohut.
Hope my new boyfriend doesn't try to make a pass at me.
I- I don't think we have to worry about that.
I see.
Kitty, I just mean the whole thing is so silly.
It's just so silly.
It's silly.
Well, it didn't used to be silly.
I remember a time when you'd beat up a guy just for looking at me.
Oh.
come on, Kitty.
I'm not worried about you and other guys.
I mean, you're a little old for crushes.
What?
Oh, I didn't mean old.
I meant advanced in beauty.
Hey.
Michael and I had a fight.
Maybe if we pretend she's not here, she'll just go away.
- I've tried.
It doesn't work.
- Mm.
Look, he actually stood up to me.
Things are changing between us.
I just don't know how to keep 'em the same.
I mean, he's not just modeling.
He's, like, leaving me behind.
Look,Jackie, you just- You can't keep trying to control him.
Yeah, that's how Eric ran me off.
Yeah, that's- Thank you.
Uh, thank you for that.
Look,Jackie.
Take it from a guy who pretty much hasn't been to second base in over two months.
You gotta let him have his own life.
You know, maybe you guys are right.
Maybe the only way to keep someone you love is by letting them go.
You know, a teacher told me that once.
But she had grown-up braces, so I didn't listen.
Oh, no.
Yup, it's me.
Hey, is my lady around?
Leo, buddy, we gotta talk.
You're getting me in a lot of trouble around here.
- Now, I'm begging you- -  Who is it, Red?
Listen, hophead!
I love that woman with a fiery passion that consumes my soul!
That's right!
So you can either walk outta here on your own or you can hop outta here with my boot in your ass!
Okay, I choose the one with nothing in my ass.
Good choice!
Well, Red that was a pretty good show you put on there.
You poured it on with a ''fiery passion that consumed your soul.
'' Hey, if you think I'm puttin' on a show to get out of the doghouse you're way off base.
If I wanted to get out of trouble, I'd just tell you how pretty you look.
Which I've been meaning to tell you.
You do.
- Oh, stow it.
- Oh, fine.
But, Kitty, you gotta understand.
If I got mad at every guy that looked at you, I'd drive myself crazy.
I don't even wanna think about all those patients down at the hospital making googly eyes at you.
Not to mention the doctors.
Don't get me started on those perverts!
They think the nursing staff is their own personal dating service.
Glorified plumbers!
Okay.
All right, Red.
You're getting very upset.
In fact, you look downright miserable.
That makes me so happy.
Hey, Donna.
I just went to the store.
Check out my new empty bag.
Empty bag, huh?
If it's empty, why are you so excited?
Well, because of its amazing potential for storage.
Storage, huh?
It better be storing an El Camino taillight.
Candy again?
You sick bastard!
You keep your distance, scalawag.
Hey!
If you guys don't shut up the phrase ''empty bag'' is gonna take on a whole new meaning for you.
- Huh?
- What?
It's a thinker.
But trust me, you don't want it to happen.
Now, Hyde, you want money.
Fez doesn't have it.
So we just need to think of something Fez can give you that's worth 80 bucks.
Eighteen dollars is your change.
Have a nice day.
Now, I know totally nude Fez isn't original but everyone seems to be happy.
I'm happy.
I'm happy too.
Hey, man, remember the three-foot rule.
All right.
I'll stay right over here.
Great.
Okay, the ball's your best friend.
Give it a big smile.
Great.
Now you're mad at the ball.
Oh, I hate you.
Bad ball.
Great.
Huh.
Didn't expect to see you here.
Well, I didn't expect to come.
But I did a lot of thinking, and- No, no.
Wh-What is it now?
You want me to drop out of high school?
Join the Salvation Army and go off and fight wars?
I came here to talk to you about your modeling, and- Yeah,Jackie, I don't have time for it right now.
It just isn't important.
Sound familiar?
Oh, yeah.
- You should go now.
- Wait, but- Okay.
Hey, let's build a sand castle.
Oh, and it's your favorite thing in the world.
Great.
!
Hey, somejerk just kicked it over.
Boo-hoo-hoo.
Great.
Todd, what are you doing here?
I saw you fighting with Michael.
I thought there might be a problem.
Even though I really hope there's not a problem.
Is there a problem?
Yeah, I think so.
Well, you know what would make you feel better?
Coming to see a movie with me.
You know what?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Let's go.
Mr. Forman, Mrs. Forman.
How may I help you?
You could help me by getting some pants on.
And for the lady?
I'll have what he's having.
Say, don't come to my house anymore.
Go, honey, go!
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Jackie, you clocked out half an hour ago.
Did you come back to tell me something?
Because I feel the same way.
I was waiting outside for Michael to pick me up, but the idiot never showed.
That's the third time this week.
Three strikes and he's out, according to the rules of baseball and love.
Actually, it's four strikes, if you count the time he showed up late 'cause he had to see how TheJetsons ended.
Man, first he goes behind your back and takes that modeling job and now this whole Jetsons thing?
No futuristic cartoon could ever keep me from you.
I just don't know what's happening to us.
Okay.
Jackie, you need to cheer up.
And the first step to cheering up is giving Todd a hug.
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.
I am so glad I went shopping today!
Hangin'out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We're all all right We're all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
!
- What do I do?
- Run like the wind!
Eric!
Did you get a haircut?
'Cause I love it.
You look just like Parker Stevenson.
Really?
'Cause I told the guy that he should- No, no, no!
That's not gonna work, tramp-face.
I saw tongue.
Okay, Eric, I know you and I don't have the best relationship.
- You mean, I hate you, and you hate me.
- Right.
So, let's turn over a new leaf by you never telling Michael what you think you just saw.
Hmm.
Or I could just torture you with this information until I'm bored.
- Eric!
- Okay, you know what?
I'll make you a deal.
You can buy two guaranteed hours of silence by carving this wheel of cheddar into a handsome likeness of me.
And go.
- Red, dinner's ready.
- Five more minutes, Kitty.
A bunch of birds threw a ''crap on my Corvette'' party.
If I don't get it off, the paint will oxidize.
Oxidize!
Why don't you just put the car in the garage?
Because if I put the car in the garage, I can't see it from the dinner table!
Kitty, don't give advice about things you don't understand!
Okay.
I'm the crazy one.
Well, um, let's just go ahead and eat.
Oh, we're not doing that yet?
You know, ever since Red got his new car, he can barely tear himself away from it.
You better watch out, Kitty, or you're gonna end up a Corvette widow.
Oh, no, he loves that car.
He deserves it.
The last treat he bought himself was a pellet gun to shoot the chipmunks that were stealing our tomatoes.
And I had to throw that away, because it was giving him war nightmares.
I'm glad you threw it out.
That thing hurt.
Kitty, I know what I'm talking about.
As soon as my ex-husband got a boat, it was like he forgot I even existed.
So I divorced him, took the boat and spent a vigorous three-day weekend on it with the harbormaster.
I don't- I don't think that's kitchen talk.
Okay, okay.
I saw Jackie making out with the guy from the cheese shop!
The little dude!
No way!
Yup.
But you're the only one I told, so don't say a word to anyone.
Okay, my little Secret Squirrel?
My lips are sealed.
Good.
'Cause I knew I could count on you.
You always can.
Think about it.
We hold information that could crush the very heart and soul of one of our best friends.
I live for days like this!
Oh, but just remember, you're the only one I told.
Your secret's safe with me.
Well, you missed a nice dinner.
Joanne said the funniest thing.
She said I was gonna end up a Corvette widow.
-  -  Isn't that a kick?
Oh, Kitty, I wouldn't leave you for the car.
Who'd make dinner?
Oh, no.
I think it's the time to proveJoanne wrong.
How are you gonna proveJoanne wrong?
What surprising and thoughtful deed are you gonna do to proveJoanne wrong?
I'm gonna prove Joanne wrong by taking you out on a special date soon.
- Tomorrow.
- Good answer!
Oh, hey, guys.
It's Kelso's loyal girlfriend,Jackie.
Hi,Jackie!
Okay, I'm not here to stay.
I just came to get Michael.
Come on.
Oh, no, stay.
We're just gonna hang out and fool around.
We all know how much you like to fool around.
Okay, Michael, come on.
Let's go to The Hub.
No, I want to stay here and fool around!
So, hey,Jackie, how's it going down at the cheese shop?
You must be so tired from giving it away at the mall.
- What are you laughing at?
- I don't know.
What are you laughing at?
I don't know.
-  What are you laughing at?
- I don't know.
-  -  What are you laughing at?
I really don't know.
- Come on, Michael.
Let's go!
- No, let's stay.
We could play Monopoly!
Oh, but that wouldn't be much fun, since we all know thatJackie cheats.
I do not!
Oh, you do cheat.
We've all caught you.
Red, this is supposed to be our special date.
There is nothing special about an auto show!
Oh, no?
How 'bout it's special 'cause you're the only woman here.
You're the queen of the auto show!
- Lord, grant me the serenity to accept- - Oh, come on, Kitty.
It'll be fun.
You're always saying how we should share each other's interests.
I only said that to get you to go to the Figurine Festival.
Okay, I do.
I want us to share our interests, so I'll start.
Teach me about cars.
I'm excited!
That's my girl.
Holy crap!
Look at the paint job on that T-bird.
Wait here.
I'll be right back.
Wait, wait.
Wait here?
Well, someone's gotta guard the car.
Who better than the queen?
Not on the bumper.
!
Oh,Jackie, great.
Just the person I was looking for.
Look, I've got this itch right above my shoulder.
Be a good girl.
Give- Give a little scratch.
Eric, I came here to talk to you about what happened yesterday.
Okay, but I can't hear you if you're not scratchin'.
Yeah!
Things between me and Michael have been weird lately and when Todd kissed me, I guess I just gave in 'cause I felt vulnerable.
But I made a terrible mistake.
And I was hoping you'd show me some compassion.
Compassion.
Wait, is that the feeling you get when someone just shined your shoes?
Because if so, you are in luck.
And go.
You know what?
I don't think so.
See, I may have kissed Todd but you knew about it all along and didn't tell Michael.
And that is way worse than what I did.
Wait, what?
Yeah.
See, girlfriends are supposed to lie.
That's what we do.
But best friends are supposed to be loyal, and you weren't.
So guess what?
You're screwed, 'cause I'm telling Michael everything!
- You wouldn't.
- Oh, I so would!
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah!
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah!
Well-Well, this certainly blew up in my face!
When I tell Michael what you did, he's gonna forget all about what I did.
Unless I get to him first.
You wouldn't.
Well, to quote a certain manager-kissing cheese maiden I know ''I so would!
'' And go!
-  Not here!
- Damn it!
Okay, Todd, like, I know we kissed and it was probably, like, the best kiss you'll ever have.
But it didn't mean anything, and nothing's gonna come of it.
So you're gonna have to get over me.
Oh, you know what?
Please don't fire me, because I really need this job.
Okay?
Great.
See you tomorrow!
Look, Kelso, I am so sorry!
- Get out of my way.
- Wait, Michael!
Great.
He hates me, right?
No.
He hates me.
We didn't even talk about you.
I mean, I told him about the kiss, and he just stormed off.
I couldn't even tell him I'm sorry.
Okay, well- I'm not going to feel sorry for you, so- Yeah.
I mean, y-you can't make me.
I just love him so much.
Oh, God.
Okay, look.
Jackie.
I-It's just one kiss, right?
That's not so bad.
Just tell Kelso what you told me about, you know, how you felt vulnerable and stuff.
Now he doesn't even want to see me.
So, you know what?
We'll go hang out in my basement and wait for him to come by.
He left his bouncy ball there, so, you know, he's bound to be by sometime.
You'd do that for me?
As long as you promise not to rat me out.
Deal.
So, friends?
As long as you promise not to tell people we're friends.
You guys are never gonna believe this.
Jackie cheated on me.
With the cheese guy!
No!
Yeah.
I was just as shocked as you are.
Well, thank God all she did was kiss him.
Yeah.
Wait.
How do you know all she did was kiss him?
Kiss?
Gee, I- I didn't say ''kiss.
'' Don't make fun of my accent.
That cheese guy's lucky he's a little fella, or I'd kick his ass.
Just, boom!
Right in the ass!
Hey, man, you gotta kick his ass.
Like, on Fantasy Island ifTattoo took one of Mr. Roarke's women up to his little tower and put it to her Roarke would slap that little dude like a drunk Southern widow!
Then he'd hit him off with some vicious voodoo.
Voodoo on Tattoo.
Voodoo.
Tattoo.
Peekaboo.
Honeydew.
Kung fu.
Koo-koo-ka-choo.
I'm done.
Well, look who's finally back.
While you were gone, some guy came by to compliment me on my headlights.
Pretty sure he wasn't talkin' about the car!
I got us funnel cakes!
It's like a second honeymoon.
Kitty, not in the car.
Hey, nice Vette.
You should come see the custom job I did on mine.
Cost me three grand and a marriage.
- Three grand?
- And a marriage!
I'll only be a minute, Kitty.
What are you lookin' at, gearhead?
Your ass is mine, cheese puff!
.
How did you know my nickname?
Wait, your nickname's cheese puff?
Stay focused.
Kick his ass!
Yeah, right.
Good.
Yeah.
What do you think you're doing kissing my girlfriend huh?
Huh?
Well, maybe if you paid more attention to that gorgeous creature than your little modeling gig, it wouldn't have happened.
Little?
That picture sold hundreds of young men's briefs all over the greater Kenosha area!
It's true.
I bought three pairs.
Very supportive.
Yeah, so look.
I know you're a little fella, but I can't let you go around kissin' my girlfriend.
So you're gonna have to take a punch.
I understand.
That didn't look like it hurt him at all.
Well, I guess it's my turn.
Okay.
I didn't mean to scare you, little guy.
I'm a black belt.
All right!
Didn't see that coming!
Thanks to your funnel-cake accident I'll have to spend half the night cleaning out the car.
Well, I hope you two will be very happy together.
Mrs. Forman!
Mrs. Forman, I have a black eye, and I need ice!
I'm not doing anything else for men today.
-Just go away.
- No.
I'm not gonna go away.
I'm having a really bad day.
I got decked by a guy who kissed Jackie.
He was huge.
And she thinks that it was okay to kiss him, because I've been ignorin' her for work.
Which I barely did!
And I got a black eye, and I need someone to care about me!
Well, well, well.
Michael ignored Jackie, and she kissed another boy.
That is completely different!
He ignored her for a stupid job.
I ignored you for a car!
- Crap.
- Oh, burn!
How many times you want to get hit today?
- Kitty, I'm sorry.
-  Next time, I'll be happy to forget about the car and go to whatever figurine quilting, macramé, man-killing thing you want to do.
Actually, there's a knitting bee at the community center right now.
You're kidding.
And you know what they say about those knitters: They spin quite a yarn!
You know what would really teach me a lesson?
Leaving me at home to, you know, think about what I've done.
If you're not in that car in two seconds, I'll make you carry my knitting basket.
Coming, dear.
Wait, wait, wait.
So Kelso got beat up?
Yeah, by the little dude at the cheese shop.
It was awesome, man.
Like a hurricane of tiny fists.
All right, look.
Jackie, here's the deal.
You cheated on me.
- You used to cheat on me all the time!
- Yeah?
Well, yeah.
But you cheated out of hate, and I cheated out of joy.
I didn't cheat out of hate, Michael.
I cheated because lately, you've been acting like I don't exist.
Well, I sure know you exist now that you Frenched the whole mall!
Look, I know that I need to pay more attention to you and I want to forgive you but I have all this anger built up inside of me and nowhere to put it.
Eric knew about the kiss all along and didn't tell you.
- You knew?
-Jackie.
What'd you expect?
You're a dead man, Forman!
Get him, Michael!
Well, guys, uh, just so you're up to speed  I knew about the kiss all along.
Eric told me.
He made me his Secret Squirrel.
What?
That dill-hole said I was the only one he told.
- Me too!
- Me too!
It was hilarious.
You guys should've seen it.
Kelso's foot got stuck in a gopher hole, and- and- Hey, w-w-why are you guys all looking at me like that?
I was your Secret Squirrel?
You son of a bitch!
Get him.
!
The '58's the only one with the chrome detail.
Mmm.
Men and cars.
Never got it, never will.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Now, Michael- Michael, for your yearbook picture don't forget to do the over-the-shoulder shot.
That's the best one.
Ah, yeah.
I love that pose.
It makes me look coy.
Oh.
Hey, guys, Tommy Hedges just got his picture taken with a big, old booger.
So, why were you in Tommy Hedges's picture?
So, wait.
He had a booger, and you didn't tell him?
He'll find out.
It'll be in the yearbook.
It's true.
That's how I found out I was adorable.
No, seriously.
The only thing more important than your yearbook picture is your yearbook quote.
Ah, I already got that covered.
My quote's gonna be, ''What a long, strange trip it's been.
'' Yeah, that's freakin' profound.
Kelso, every lame-o hippie in the history of time has used that quote.
Well, yeah.
That's 'cause it's good.
No, Michael.
Your quote has to be meaningful so you can remember the good times when you're, like, 30, with no reason left to live.
Okay, hidden in Jackie's extremely disturbing thought is a grain of truth.
We need a really good quote this year.
Well, all the best quotes are about things that mean a lot to you.
Like, for example, me.
Or my hair, or my personality or the sparkle I bring to your dull, gray lives.
Or the feeling of relief we get when you leave the room.
No.
You know what?
We need a quote about all of us.
- Like, maybe like how we all met.
- Remember how we first met?
Oh, is this a sexy story?
- It's really more sad than sexy.
- Yeah.
That's pretty much how it goes for you, isn't it?
Yeah.
Okay, now, got your brownies for the new neighbors, Eric?
Yes, Mommy.
How do I look?
- Well, you got a little something- - Don't touch it!
I had to sleep sitting up to keep it like this.
Well, I just hope these new neighbors are better than the last one.
That Gus Griffin was a complete dumb-ass.
Hiya, neighbors!
Well, hello.
We were just coming to welcome you.
Looks like we beat you to the punchity-punch.
Oh, damn.
I'm Bob Pinciotti.
This is my daughter, Donna.
My wife Midge'll be over later.
Her thumb's caught in something right now.
Well, we've all done that.
I guess.
Well, I'm Kitty, and this is Red and this is our son Eric.
Eric, say hello to Donna.
What are you looking at, string bean?
Wow.
You're strong.
-  -  Hangin'out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We're all all right We're all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
!
-  - That's-Yeah, go ahead and laugh.
None of you were punched by Madam Man-fist here.
You were creepy.
What can I say?
Forman beat up by a girl.
Seems like only yesterday.
Oh, wait.
I think it happened yesterday too.
That's- You like that story, Hyde?
Maybe I should talk about the first time you and I met.
- No.
- Yes.
- No!
- Yes.
- You promised!
- I'm telling!
Thanks for walking me home, Steven.
That redheaded girl hits really hard.
Some advice?
Never let a girl stand on your head like that.
Bad for the rep.
- Okay, Steven.
- And it's Hyde.
Thanks, Hyde.
Hey, wouldn't it be funny if my last name was Seek?
You know, Hyde and Seek!
That's stupid.
And you owe me a quarter.
Well, now.
Who do we have here?
This is Hyde.
Oh, you have a new little friend.
Red, get the camera.
I'm not his friend.
I'm a hired gun.
Kitty, don't embarrass the boy.
Oh, don't be silly.
It's nice to have a new friend.
Especially one who's so dirty!
You know what's fun?
I'm sorry, Son.
If you ever tell anyone about this, I'll kill you.
Now I have to kill you.
I don't know.
I like to bathe with friends.
They can reach places you can't.
Yeah.
That's probably best kept to yourself, buddy.
You guys, look at Eric's last-year's picture.
The famous makeup-covered zit.
Look, I just wanted one year of clear skin to remember.
And if that means breaking out the old powder puff so be it.
You've never really had a zit-free picture.
Remember the one on his nose?
Oh, and the one on his lip?
And the one on the one on his lip?
And the one we thought was a second little alien Eric growing out of his cheek?
I mean no harm to your planet.
I will attack if you attempt to pop me.
Ah, zits.
Hey, those days are over, okay?
I'm zit-free this year, and you want to know why?
- I have become a man.
-  No, I'm serious.
I am man.
I am zitless.
Hear me roar.
That should be our yearbook quote.
What about a quote from the happiest day of our lives?
- When was that?
- The day you met me.
And then Potsie says, ''Sit on it.
''  Right to the Fonz's face!
Now, that's brave!
- Hey, what's with Donna?
- What?
We're just friends.
God, why would you even ask that?
I don't like her.
Me and Donna?
It's- It's gross!
Hey, man, I was just asking why she wasn't in class today.
Oh.
Well, then, never mind.
Busted!
Help.
!
Americans, please help me.
!
- What was that?
- It's coming from in here.
Oh, hello.
Who the hell are you?
I am the new foreign exchange student.
The football team asked me if I wanted to ''hang out.
'' I shouldn't have said yes.
I can't feel my legs.
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna chuck it at him.
No, man.
Leave him alone.
Look, man, if those jocks try to do this to you again,just come find me.
Thanks.
You are my best friend.
Let's hold hands.
Uh, no.
Let's go.
- I'm Hyde.
- I'm Eric.
- Oh, you're the one that loves Donna.
- I do not!
Well, my name is- -  -  Okay, I'm not gonna remember that.
I know.
Let's call him Captain Poo-face!
Oh!
Ow!
My eye!
God!
Yeah, this happens a lot.
I'm sure it does, Donna lover.
Aww!
I forgot about Captain Poo-face!
And I did not like her then!
Damn!
You know what I love about Kelso?
Hyde just keeps beating the crap out of him.
That is false!
- Name one time!
- With pleasure.
- I love mashed potatoes.
- Oh, yeah?
Uh-oh.
Not my eye.
!
- Foul!
- You know what's foul?
Your playing.
Ow!
Oh, that's my eye!
God!
- Change it back.
- No.
Change it back.
No-o-o.
- My eye.
!
-  Seriously, man.
You keep hurting my eye.
That's a terrible story.
- I'm not even in that one.
- That's what makes it good.
Okay, people, please remain calm.
I'm still zit-free.
I'm gonna make it.
I'm gonna make it!
Okay, stop goofing around.
We need to think of a better memory.
What about the day I met you?
All of you.
You're gonna like Donna.
She's pretty cool, man.
-  Hyde!
- Wow!
Sorry.
Wow!
- What?
- You're right.
I like her!
No, wait!
I didn't see!
Wait!
-  -  Donna?
Now, that's a good memory.
Or should I say ''mammary''?
I don't want to remember that story.
It just reminds me that I'm the only one here who's never seen Donna's jahoobs.
Well, it's not like you never tried.
Oops, sorry!
Aw, damn.
Oops, sorry!
Aw, damn.
Oops, sorry!
Damn it!
Hey, speaking of boobs Forman's growin' one out of his forehead.
What?
Oh, Eric, your curse has returned.
Yeah, and it needs a bra.
Oh, yeah.
Dolly Parton called your forehead.
She wants her boob back.
God, I can actually see this thing growing.
It's likeJiffy Pop.
My friend once- He had this really big zit.
And he tried to pop it and all the pus went into his brain, and it killed him.
Really, Kelso?
What friend?
- You didn't know him.
- That's 'cause he doesn't exist.
'Cause he's dead now!
People, we are losing focus here.
Well, what is our quote gonna be?
And let's remember, our goal is to have it be about me.
I can't think about anything right now except Forman's zit.
It's hypnotic.
- It sort of follows you around the room like the Mona Lisa.
- All right.
Hey, you wanna know something that's even funnier than Eric's zit?
The day I metJackie.
You're Donna?
We haven't met before.
I guess because I'm richer than you.
- Hey,Jackie.
- Ow!
That hurt, you lumberjack!
Welcome to public school.
I can't believe I missed that.
You know, when you laugh you get a little wrinkle in your zit.
It's got personality.
Okay, well, what am I supposed to do?
It hurts way too much to pop.
Come here, man.
Let me see it.
Aah!
What?
Quit it!
Yeah, Kelso's friend died that way.
Donna, he did!
Whatever.
Look, all I know is there's gotta be some good quote offJackie getting hit in the head.
Like, ''Awesome!
Jackie got hit in the head!
'' No.
No, no.
That's a stupid story.
You know, I want to remember the happy times.
Maybe something romantic.
Ooh, like our first date.
- Yeah.
- Let me tell it.
Red, Michael's in the fort with another girl.
All right.
Everybody out.
Michael Kelso, have you been playing doctor with the Burkhart girl?
No.
I am a doctor.
Good one.
I mean, uh, you're a very bad boy.
Don't yell at him!
I love him.
Michael, that was not our first date!
Yeah, but I got further on that day than I did on our actual first date, so that's what I like to remember.
Yeah, you made a great impression on my parents that year.
Hi, Mr. Forman.
Is Eric home?
Um, yes but, uh- Kitty?
Oh, my.
Michael, honey, did you maybe forget something?
What?
My pants!
Why doesn't anyone just tell nice stories?
Everyone can think of a quote.
I mean, why can't we?
Hey, why don't we use Lisa Manning's?
''Hangin' at the mall.
Kahlúa and ice cream.
Bobby Sutton's a god.
Yeah!
'' God, this is so sad.
It's like, what have we been doing with our lives?
Hey, Kelso, who's got stronger powers- I Dream ofJeannie or Samantha from Bewitched?
That's easy.
Samantha.
Witches totally beat genies 'cause witches can fly.
Game over.
Hey, why does Jeannie wear those see-through clothes?
It's gross.
And it makes me feel funny.
No way is Samantha hotter than Jeannie!
Hey, I heard they made an episode they never aired whereJeannie gets totally naked.
The government banned it.
All I know is, with one little nose twitch Samantha's clothes could be off!
.
And that's hot.
What if you didn't have to choose?
What if you could be with both at the same time?
Is that legal?
Hey, man, if you don't get caught everything's legal.
Stolen pretzel?
Guys, this conversation is over.
Yesterday, Samantha went back in time.
That trumps anything Jeannie ever did.
Oh, yeah?
Well,Jeannie can freeze time.
So, Samantha would go back, and Jeannie could just freeze her there.
Who kicked whose ass then?
You know what would decide this whole thing?
A little Samantha-on-Jeannie mud wrestling.
I'd pay a dollar to see that.
All I know is, Samantha helps Darrin at work but what does Jeannie do for Major Nelson?
Turns his boss into a monkey.
This is not helpful.
I've got to call Major Nelson's sexuality into question here.
I mean, any guy who's got a half-naked genie- He's got her doing more than his laundry.
Hey, you know what would be best?
Samantha's hair, Jeannie's pretty bottle room and Wonder Woman's accessories.
-  -  Hey, guys.
We've been talking about this for a really, really long time.
Oh!
Ooh!
-  -   I got it!
I got the quote!
''What a long, strange trip it's been in Forman's basement.
'' -  - Yeah.
We have made a lot of memories in that basement.
Too bad we can't remember any of'em.
All right, you guys.
I think it's ready.
I'm off to pop.
Wait a minute.
I hate that quote.
My name isn't anywhere in that quote.
Okay, fine.
You know, I'll just make my quote ''What a long, strange trip it's been with Jackie Burkhart.
'' Yeah, okay but without the ''long, strange trip'' part.
- All right.
So I'll just write- - ''I loveJackie Burkhart.
'' Okay.
Okay, guys, I did it.
Looks better, right?
Great.
All right.
Picture time.
Yeah, I'll meet you guys in there.
I gotta change my blouse.
Everybody out.
- Oops, sorry!
- Kelso!
Kelso, we just talked about this today!
Well, damn, Donna.
If you'd just let me see 'em, I'd stop.
Fine.
They're beautiful.
Hangin'out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you Ooh,yeah Hello, Wisconsin.
!
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Hey, Kelso.
Well, that's a mighty big smile.
What, did you get into the Play-doh?
No.
I'm happy 'cause today is Gift Day.
And in honor of this special day, I got you all gifts.
All right.
Aerosmith Live.
Yeah, for my friend who rocks.
- Oh, man.
The new Rolling Stone.
- For my friend who reads.
Oreos!
For my friend who snacks.
-  -  -  -   A triple-decker burn!
Awesome!
Wha-There's peanut butter on my headphones!
These cookies are filled with toothpaste!
All right.
That noise did not come out of my butt.
Welcome to Prank Day.
That's right.
It's Prank Day.
''Gift Day.
'' You idiots.
A whoopee cushion?
What are you, two?
These things are great.
Hangin'out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We're all all right We're all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
!
- You got something in your ear, man.
- What?
Oh, my goodness.
It's peanut butter!
Ha-ha.
Peanut butter wet willy.
Very clever.
- But the thing about it is, you don't have to be clever.
-  Okay!
Okay!
This Prank Day is over.
Let's just watch TV.
Hey, Fez, I think there's a Nancy Drew on.
Oh!
She can solve my mystery any day.
And by the way, the mystery is in my pants.
Okay.
That's it.
I got a peanut in my ear.
Yeah.
I used chunky, so it might get up in your brain.
Yeah.
Ha-ha.
Laugh it up now, man, 'cause fun time is over.
What the hell?
I'm stuck.
I have been glued!
Not glued, superglued.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
So you covered the freezer handle and the TV knob in superglue?
Knowing Forman's love for Popsicles and Fez's love for knobs!
Yeah.
I'm an evil mastermind.
Kelso, is there a cushion glued to my butt?
No.
Not glued, superglued.
- You're a dead man.
- Yeah?
What are you gonna do- sit on me with your cushion-butt?
It won't hurt, 'cause it's a cushion-butt.
Ooh!
Oh, my goodness.
Whoa!
Okay.
If you could be the princess in any country, what country would it be?
I pick Monaco.
See, I always wanted to wear my crown with a bikini.
Donna, you're not listening to me!
This is my life here.
Oh.
Sorry.
It's just-You know, today would've been my parents' anniversary.
But my mom's gone, my dad's with Joanne, and Casey's out of town.
So it just kind of sucks.
You know what you need?
A littleJackie magic.
- I am gonna dedicate my whole day to you.
- Oh, like you did last month when I had to hold your corn dog and guard the van while you and Kelso did it at the 4-H Fair?
Yeah.
Wasn't that fun?
Man, I can't wait to see this big bucket of oatmeal landing on Kelso's big bucket of a head.
Well, good gracious, who's all this oatmeal for?
Uh, it's for the oatmeal drive for the Needy Oatmeal Lovers of America.
Right, the N.O.L.O.A. Oh, oh, this tastes awful.
You know,just because they're hoboes doesn't mean they don't respond to herbs and spices.
You know what?
That's a good point, Mom but you better leave, 'cause we don't like to do our charity work in front of other people.
Oh, now, don't be silly.
I'll help you.
Where'd I put my brown sugar?
Oh, I'm right here, honey buns.
Okay.
I'm here for our slumber party.
Wow.
When you said you were gonna dedicate your whole day to me I figured that meant only until we left The Hub.
No.
I promised you which is equal to seven days of an ugly person's time.
Well, it's just, I'm in the middle of this really good book.
Donna, books are for prisoners.
Now, I brought tons of activities.
First, some makeup for your long-overdue facial overhaul.
The greatest board game ever Mystery Date.
And-Wait.
Best of all my stuffed animals so we can perform an all-unicorn rendition of Grease.
This is perfect.
We are so gonna nail Kelso.
I still say we should have shaved his privates.
That's a burn that keeps on burnin'.
- Kelso's on his way.
- Okay, gentlemen.
Take your positions.
Okay.
I'm here.
- Where's the dead bird?
- Kelso, you're supposed to come in through the side door.
- What?
- Eric, I need you to take out the- You guys are so dead.
What the hell is this?
Eric did it because he hates you.
Hyde!
Forman, every man for himself.
No, uh, Dad, this was just a prank that's gone wrong- horribly, horribly wrong.
Well, I've got a prank too- one where my foot doesn't plow through your ass.
Let's hope it doesn't go horribly, horribly wrong!
Oh, Red.
What happened to you?
That oatmeal was for the hoboes.
Well, the idiots used it for a prank.
Eric, how many times have I told you, don't poke the bear.
Don't poke the bear!
Well, technically, we didn't poke the bear.
We pour oatmeal on the bear.
- Are you correcting my wife?
- Kelso's laughing at you.
Are you laughing?
Oh, come on.
You're covered in oatmeal!
It's funny!
- That's it!
- Oh, oh, you know what you should do, Red?
Forgive and forget.
Turn the other cheek, likeJesus.
Be likeJesus, Red.
I can't even think of a punishment big enough for this!
But trust me, it's going to be awful- the kind of thing that Harry Truman might order to end a war!
Guys, who's Harry Truman?
He invented electricity, dumb-ass.
Okay, Donna.
It's makeover time.
Let's pack those jumbo pores.
Um, you know what?
I've thought about it, and I'm glad my mom left.
More food for me.
- Oh, come on.
It'll be fun.
- I doubt it.
Unless- You were right, Donna.
Now, not only are we beautifying but we're ''groovifying.
'' Hey, I just made up a word.
Yeah.
Who ever said you can't do two great things at once?
I bet it was a one-armed, pessimistic guy.
Yeah, you just gotta stay positive, man.
Like, I don't want to learn French so everyday I think positive thoughts about not learning French.
And look at me.
I don't know a word of French.
Is Dad still gonna kill me?
Eric, I put him in his Corvette tuned the radio to a hockey game and handed him a beer.
I've done all I can.
- Dad- - All right.
Just tell me.
What the hell did you think you were doing?
Look, Kelso invented this stupid Prank Day thing and he superglued us, so the oatmeal thing was just to, you know, get him back.
And that's when my life as I know it ended.
Are you telling me, I got covered with oatmeal because you were trying to get back at Kelso which you didn't even do?
Well, that's a bit of an oversimplification.
- I think if you look at the facts- - You-  The facts are, you were bested by a Kelso.
How could you do this to your family?
I didn't realize the honor of our family was at stake.
It always is.
Hell, we've been talking about this since T-ball which you quit.
I mean, what was there to be scared of?
The ball just sits there.
All right.
Here's what I'm gonna do.
Instead of punishing you, I'm gonna show you how to do this prank business right.
Now, get the Three Stooges over to dinner tonight.
You are going to help me get them good and scared.
- Oh, well, no, Dad.
I don't wanna get Hyde and Fez.
-  - They're on my team.
- Well, your team lost.
So everybody cries.
Well, hope you boys like lasagna.
Oh, boy, lasagna- the Italian burrito.
Thanks for havin' us over, Mrs. Forman.
Oh, don't thank me.
It was Red's idea.
- Wait a minute.
Red's coming?
- Uh, yeah.
I can't believe you guys showed up.
Wait.
No.
The only reason we showed up was 'cause you said Red was workin' late tonight.
Oh, God, you know what?
He's in the kitchen.
Should I just get him?
No, you should not get him, you son of a bitch.
- I'm goin' out the window.
- Guys, calm down.
Look, what could he possibly do to us at dinner?
Ah, good.
All the half-wits are here.
I wanted to let you know that I'm going to get you and you won't know where, and you won't know when.
But it will hurt.
And you will cry, and I will laugh, and- Did I mention it will hurt?
Very good.
Now, enjoy the lasagna.
I added the special seasoning myself.
Special seasoning?
Uh-oh.
All right.
Maybe it's because I'm extra clever but I think that there might be somethin' wrong with the lasagna and I think maybe Red had somethin' to do with it.
Kelso I wouldn't do anything to the lasagna just like I wouldn't do anything to your new sneakers that are sitting by the kitchen door.
My Chucks!
Why isn't anybody eating?
Is there something wrong with my lasagna?
We have reason to believe it's been tampered with.
Is this another prank?
Because I will not have this in my house.
Now eat that lasagna.
It's perfectly fine.
I said eat it!
Mmm.
Dad, what is this special seasoning?
Oh, a little of this, a little of that.
Which reminds me.
Kitty, I cleaned out the dead moths from the porch light.
If I could only remember where I put them.
- Aw, bugs?
Sick!
- I'm out of here.
Okay, Leo.
Who's your Mystery Date?
All right.
The ski instructor.
He's hunky.
You know,Jackie, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm actually having a good time.
Wait.
Michael, what are you doing here?
Yeah, man.
This is girls' night.
Jackie, I just had dinner with Red, and he totally freaked me out.
So, first I need you to stick your hand in my Chucks.
Then I need you to hang out with me, because I'm really afraid to be alone.
- No.
No, Michael.
I am spending time with Donna.
- Okay, but I was gonna take you to the mall and tell everyone you were a Dallas Cowboy Cheerleader.
Wait, wait.
You never want to do that.
Okay.
Let's go.
Huh.
I guess it's just you and me, Leo.
A whole pan of lasagna wasted and it's a recession.
- Kitty, you don't understand.
- I understand that you need to start acting like a parent.
But we have different responsibilities as parents.
Your job is to tell him that he's cute and to clean his ears.
My job is to make him a man, which he's not.
Dad, I'm- I'm right here.
Shut up, boy.
You see how he shuts up?
That's not right.
I give up.
- Wow, she seems mad.
- Ah, she'll burn it off on her Exercycle.
- We really did freak out those guys tonight, huh?
- Hmm!
Now, it's time to go after Kelso- the head dummy.
And we're gonna have the junior dummies help us out.
You know what?
We make a good team.
It's like I'm Batman, and you're- Er- No.
You're-You're Batman.
Hey, Donna?
Wait.
Where's Leo?
Oh, he left.
He asked if he could try on my dad's clothes, and I said no, so he left.
What?
He left?
That jerk.
What a bad friend.
Jackie, you left too.
I know, I know.
Look, that's why I'm here.
I was at the mall signing autographs for a bunch of sixth graders.
You know, ''Go, Cowboys.
Love,Jackie.
'' And then I saw this little girl crying 'cause she couldn't find her mom and she reminded me of you, so I felt bad.
Jackie, that's so sweet.
So what happened with the little girl?
- She find her mom?
- You know what?
I don't know.
I left her with the snow-cone guy.
Yeah.
She smelled like poo.
Look, anyways, my point is you know, since you don't have your mom around anymore you need a girl in your life to look after you, and that's gonna be me.
- Unless I smell like poo.
- Right.
So when Kelso gets here, he'll walk by the driveway- which we've iced down with the hose- and he'll see a nudie magazine lying there- which is perfect for Kelso, because he can never resist a boob.
- Well, who among us can?
- Right.
So, he'll sprint towards it, slip on the ice and slide into a giant pile of mud.
Get ready.
I hear footsteps.
- What are we lookin' at?
- Kelso?
Wait, wait.
If you're here, then who is in the driveway?
-  - Oh, crap!
Well, the driveway was all icy, and I fell.
I think I heard a pop.
- Mrs. Forman, we are so sorry.
- Mom, are you okay?
- Okay.
Fez, grab her legs.
-  Get away from her!
Eric, you're grounded for a week.
But this prank was your idea!
- Fine.
Two weeks!
- Wha- And the rest of you, get the hell outta here.
Go on now.
Well, this was another prank?
See what happens when you act like a jackass?
Kitty, I am so sorry and I promise: no more pranks, ever.
Okay.
- So, we're done here.
- Wait!
You're not hurt.
You were faking it.
Oh, don't sound so surprised.
I fake things plenty.
- Wait.
So you're not hurt at all?
- Nope.
Wow.
You out-pranked Dad.
No, no, no.
It wasn't a prank.
It was a lesson.
And yes, I did.
So, you're the best Forman.
You're Batman.
Now you know.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Hey, guess who's dropping Jackie off here after cheerleading practice?
Leslie Cannon.
Ah, Leslie Cannon.
Nickname: The Cannon.
Why?
Because she always shoots Eric down.
Man, you were so in love with her.
Remember in the seventh grade when she asked you your name and you got all panicky and said, "Uh-bluh"?
Yeah, and then she called you "Uh-bluh" for, like, the next two years.
That was awesome.
I still don't see why we have to spend the night.
It only took me 30 minutes to get caught up with everyone at my high school reunion.
Oh, well, standing in the corner muttering "dumb-ass" at everyone doesn't count as getting caught up.
I can't wait to see some dear, old girlfriends.
Like the Miller twins.
God, I hope they're fat.
Oh, crap.
There's no way that all these bags are gonna fit in here.
Oh, geez, I was really looking forward to taking this baby out on the highway.
Well, we'll just have to take two cars.
No, we'll take the Toyota.
I can bring another dress.
Shows a little more leg so Stuart McDaniel can see what he missed out on.
Oh, hey, you guys.
Here comes Leslie.
Hey, how's my hair?
It's a little messy.
Hey, it's Uh-bluh!
Yeah, um, I'm going by Eric now.
She doesn't care what your name is, Eric.
She's a cheerleader.
Wow, this car is so hot!
Yeah, that's kind of like what I was thinking.
Really?
'Cause I was thinking she was hot.
Yeah.
Hey, mama.
So, uh, whose car is this?
Oh, uh, it's my dad's tough luck that it's mine.
So, what kind of engine is in this thing?
Oh, well, it's, uh it's a multi-piston That's, uh, twice as powerful as the the 100.
You know what?
I think you should take me for a drive tonight.
Are you talking to me?
Yeah No Sure.
Yeah No Shut up.
Yes, it's my car.
Sure.
- Pick me up at 7:00.
- Okay.
Oh, my God.
What have I done?
Well, you're using your dad's dream car to get with a totally hot chick who would otherwise never date you.
When you put it like that, it just sounds right.
Here's the keys to the Corvette.
But the only reason I'm giving them to you is so you can move it in case there's a fire.
And because you trust me.
Right!
Now, you know that I'll know if the Corvette's been moved.
I've noted its exact position in the garage the angle of the wheels and I just might have set a few booby traps.
I am so lucky to have a daddy who cares enough to set booby traps.
Fine.
Okay, I get it.
The only way I get to drive the Corvette is if there's a fire.
But to the end of the driveway.
No further.
A fire is no excuse for a joyride.
Michael, what are you doing in Casey's room?
Spittin' in his socks.
What are you doing?
We came by to say hi to Casey.
Watching you spit is just a super bonus.
Yeah?
Well, your lover's out of town.
And I asked your lover where he was going and your lover said, "Neptune," and that he'd be back tomorrow.
And then your lover punched me in the head and laughed.
But we'll see who's laughing when he puts on his socks and gets his feet all spitty.
Ha!
Casey's out of town?
He never tells me anything.
It's like the only thing I know about him is that he's Kelso's brother.
Well, you know he subscribes to Van Aficionado.
Stop snooping, Jackie.
But, Donna, you know, say this pile of stuff was to get accidentally knocked over.
Oh, no!
And while picking it up, you just happen to look through it.
Jackie, I'm not gonna snoop.
Oh, look!
He took a quiz.
"Your Ideal Chick: Van Fan or Biker Liker"?
But you know what?
You wouldn't care what kind of girl he likes.
I mean, you're only dating him.
Oh, no!
Forman, I can't believe you're actually gonna take out Red's Corvette.
Yeah, and I can't believe you're wearing brown shoes with a black belt.
That's just tacky.
Guys, the odometer's busted.
The odometer's busted!
That's a sign from God.
God loves me.
He wants me to steal the car.
Besides, I think I've learned most of Red's tricks now like this one: The old "strand of hair across the ignition" trap.
Yeah, you're a regular Green Beret, Forman.
Oh, please.
With that outfit, a green beret is the last thing he needs.
Well, here we are in my Corvette enjoying the open road and the delightful, pine-fresh scent of your hair.
That's your cheapo air freshener.
- Yuck.
- No, no, no, no.
No, no.
Hello.
Can I drive?
Uh, I don't know.
Uh-bluh.
Okay, now, if the Miller twins are fat, be nice.
But if they're still thin, I don't want to hear any "hubba-hubbas" or remarks about doubling your pleasure.
Remember, it's my reunion.
I am the prettiest one here.
Well, you are the prettiest one here.
I don't understand.
The invitation says the 29th.
Kitty, that says the 23rd.
I have been telling you for months that you need glasses.
You know, one of these days, you're gonna wander off and fall into a hole.
What hole?
Where are these holes?
They're everywhere.
You just can't see 'em, 'cause you need glasses.
Well, we spent three hours in Casey's room and all we found out is that he collects mud flaps.
Yeah, but all that snooping gave me such a rush.
Hey, let's go to the mall and shoplift some lip gloss.
No thanks, little felon.
I feel guilty enough.
Besides, I have to finish my chemistry homework.
Oh, no!
I left my chemistry book on Casey's desk, and he comes back tomorrow!
So we'll just go back and get it.
Jackie, I already went over there all, "Where's Casey"?
Now if I go back all, "Where's my book" But you are all, "Where's my book"?
But Kelso won't believe that, and then he'll think I'm a goob and then he'll tell Casey that I'm a goob!
Okay.
Okay, look.
We'll wait till later tonight, then sneak back in and get it.
Besides, Casey's got this really great clock radio I really want.
Oh, Kitty, don't tell Eric that we're coming home.
If he's doing something wrong and we both know he is it's important that I catch him.
- Why?
- Because it gives me pleasure.
- There's the three.
- Shut it!
I'm Red, dumb-ass.
Where are my muffins, dumb-ass?
Forman residence.
Dr. Hook speaking.
Who is it, dumb-ass?
Steven, honey, it's Mrs. Forman.
- Oh, hey, Mrs. Forman.
- Mrs. Forman?
Um, there's been some sort of sort of little mistake.
I finished my homework.
Now let's move on to Bible study!
It seems like my reunion was last week.
Oh, that's too bad.
You were really looking forward to seeing them fat twins, right?
So, we're coming home tonight.
Tell Eric, okay?
It's important.
Yeah, of course.
Okay.
Bye, sweetie.
They're coming home early.
You know what this means?
- Yeah, we have to hurry up and find Eric.
- No.
We have to hurry up and finish the rest of Red's beer.
Hopefully, Forman'll get blamed for that too.
Boy, this is fun, but I think race time is over now!
Good, we're slowing down.
That's good.
A little motion sickness going on.
But, uh, the car's all in one piece, so I'm on top of the world.
What was that?
That was me falling off the top of the world.
Well, the good news is, I found the hubcap in a huge field of mud.
And the other good news is, in about a hundred years some archaeologist is gonna be thrilled to find my shoes.
Sorry.
Yeah, well, you know Look, there aren't any scratches or dents.
So, just dirt.
I-I think I'm in the clear.
Eric, I'm starting to think I might like you.
- Really?
- I'm not sure though.
I think I have to drive the car some more.
Oh.
Well, I'm starting to think I might let you drive the car.
- Really?
- I'm not sure though.
I think we might have to make out some more.
- Okay, I got it.
- Okay, let's go.
Jackie?
Donna?
Am I dreaming?
Uh, yes.
- Yes, you are.
- Are we gonna do it?
Yes.
Yes, Michael, we are.
Cool.
Donna first.
So you smooched the Cannon.
How was her tongue?
Was it nimble?
Like a belly dancer.
And at one point I was touching a spot not four inches from boob.
Not bad, Forman.
Not only did you get within shouting distance of second base you successfully snaked Red's Corvette.
Yeah, well, I gotta wash it, wax it and put on a hubcap, but that should only take about an hour.
I'm gonna do it in the morning.
- Perfect.
Sleep tight.
- All right.
Oh, by the way, um, your parents called a couple hours ago.
- They'll be home in 40 minutes.
- What?
Relax, man.
We're just messing with you.
They'll be home in 20 minutes.
Okay, tire location, check.
Seat placement, check.
Picture of Fez's butt, check.
That one's going on my desk.
Okay, you guys, there's just one more thing: The strand of hair over the ignition.
Well, you're gonna get away with it.
What a bunch of crap.
Okay, you guys, they're here.
Damn it!
The air freshener!
Damn it, you remembered.
Well, there's the Corvette, safe and sound.
I'm just saying that for your benefit, in case you can't see it.
Well, I am so glad you raced all the way home without stopping for this.
Cripes, I gotta pee like a banshee.
Well, I'm off to the candy shop.
My Everlasting Gobstopper just crapped out on me.
Fez, I was sleeping in Casey's room and I think somehow I had one of his dreams, 'cause I did it with Hey, guys.
No, no, Michael.
Finish your sentence.
You did it with A hat on?
A-And you.
You, me and a hat.
It was hot.
Of course it was.
Everything's better with a hat.
Come on, fellas.
Put a hat on.
The lady deserves it.
What were you doing in Casey's bed anyway?
Oh, when he's out of town, I like to skank it up by skipping a couple showers and sleeping in it naked.
Michael, tell me more about this dream.
Was anyone else there?
Jackie, why would I have a sexy dream with anyone besides you?
Hey, Donna.
Hey, your old man wants to talk to you outside.
- Why?
Am I busted?
- Don't worry, man.
It's not about the car.
- Oh.
- Oh, Forman, I almost forgot.
It's about the car.
You gotta stop doing that, man!
Um, you wanted to see me?
Did you take my car out last night?
No.
I know you didn't.
Guess how I know!
I stuck a hair across the ignition.
A hair acro You know, someday I'm gonna use that on my son.
Anyway, since I know I can trust you, I'm gonna let you drive it.
I finally get to drive it?
Wow!
Okay, uh, where does the key go?
- Start her up.
- Okay.
And I'm grounded.
For a month!
Why did you do it?
To impress this cheerleader.
No kidding?
Well, then make it two weeks.
So, uh, you gonna see her again?
Well, can I have the car again?
Ohh, she's that girl.
I know that girl.
Stay away from that girl.
Hey, Forman, your mom wants to talk to you.
She wants to know why you drank all of Red's beer.
You know what?
Let's just call it a month.
- Michael.
- Jackie?
- Am I dreaming?
- Yes, you are.
Are we gonna do it?
- Yes, we are.
- Oh, cool.
Where's Donna?
What?
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
Any good mail?
Well, we got the new Yarn Barn catalog.
And the model is showing cleavage?
You know, if I want that in my house, I will watch McMillan and Wife.
Oh, Steven got a letter from Department of Motor Vehicles.
What?
Another damn ticket?
Hey, screw-head!
Why is the D.M.V. sending you letters?
-  Screw-head.
Hey, screw-head.
-  No, no, no.
You're screw-head.
I'm just called ''boy.
'' I got a letter from the D.M.V.?
Oh, my God.
It's about the cow.
Did I say ''cow''?
Because what I meant was countdown- countdown to better driving.
I think what Eric's trying to say is, he hit a cow.
Wait- Well, I had the right-of-way!
Go ahead.
Open it, hot rod.
You know, you are the most irresponsible careless, no-account, undisc- Oh, it's a license renewal for my 1 8th birthday.
Oh.
Happy birthday!
Guess who gets 1 8 hugs the day before his 1 8th birthday?
One, two- Everyone!
-  Three, four, five- - Okay.
- six, seven, eight- - Okay.
All right, all right!
Thanks, Mrs. Forman, but you can drop it.
I'm not really into birthdays, especially this one.
- Oh, no, you don't!
Nine, ten- - Get off me, spaz!
Oh, Steven likes birthdays.
He just doesn't know it.
Which is why we're throwing him a surprise party.
Now, I need two helpers with keen feminine sensibilities to help decorate.
Jackie and Fez.
Yea.
What the hell?
I'm feminine.
I should kick her ass for that.
Hey,Jackie, while you're up there, try not to kiss any more guys!
Man, are you guys still fighting about that?
You gotta come down hard on stuff like this.
If she'd have come down harder on me when I was cheating, I would've- Well, I would have been way sneakier about it.
You know what, you guys?
Eighteen is a big deal.
We ought to get Hyde, like, the perfect Hyde gift.
So, you know what?
Let's try to put ourselves in a total Hyde state of mind.
Yeah.
Okay, now, what would Hyde want?
Something stolen.
Stolen's good.
But you know what's better?
-  - Stolen and dirty!
So what's a good gift for Hyde that's stolen and dirty?
Someone else's pig!
No, no, wait!
I got it!
I got it!
A street sign.
We'll steal it, so it'll be stolen and it's dirty, so it'll be dirty.
Oh, my God.
Kelso just solved his first word problem.
Ohh!
Yeah, I learned those in Miss Carter's class 'cause I knew if I got one right that'd she'd give me a hug.
No bra and they were always pointy.
Now, that's good teachin'.
No problem.
You can have Hyde's party here.
There's only one thing I ask.
Can I come?
The party's at your house, Bob.
Of course you're invited.
Oh, boy, I'm in!
I'll get my Anne Murray albums!
Okay, now, you two.
I want this party to look nice.
So, um, balloons, streamers- whatever makes Steven forget he has no parents.
So, Fez, how do you want to decorate this place?
- Well, what I'm thinking- - No, no, no.
I want Arabian Nights- veils, Persian rugs.
Uh-huh.
One question,Jackie.
Is this a party for Hyde, or a bunch of whores in a whorehouse?
Oh, yeah.
Check it out!
''High Street.
'' Oh, man.
Hyde's gonna love this.
- Here, Donna, I'll give you a boost.
- Okay.
One, two, three.
Oh, yeah!
Fingers!
- Oh!
- Come on, Eric.
I'll give you a boost.
No way.
Why not?
Because you'll throw me.
What?
No, I won't!
Yeah, I will.
Look.
How about we stand on top of the van and reach it?
I think not!
We'll dent the roof.
I don't want nothin' to happen to the ''love bus.
'' Okay, I got it.
I got a better idea.
Okay,just make sure it's tight.
Right.
Okay, you're good to go.
Well, at least the roof s okay.
Steven!
I thought you were at work.
Not till later.
Why are you baking so many cupcakes?
I had four dozen eggs.
They were gonna go bad.
Mrs. Forman, I don't want a party.
And I'm not saying that because I'm fishing for a party.
I mean, I don't want a party.
- Uh-huh.
- 'Cause I know how this family works.
You guys say you don't want stuff that you actually want.
Like on Mother's Day.
You said you didn't want a fuss.
But you did want a fuss.
So we made a fuss, and you were happy?
That can drive a guy nuts.
It really can.
So now, I don't know what to do or say or not say because I really don't want a party.
Well, I don't wanna do anything you don't want.
See, I don't know what that means!
Well, it means there's no party.
Oh, please.
Would I lie to you about making you a party?
I am hurt.
Fine.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
- You lied.
- No, no.
I said, ''Would I lie?
'' It was very tricky.
I was like Houdini, but with words.
The base of the sign's all cracked.
So all we have to do is shove this firecracker in there, and blammo!
The sign comes down.
Wow, it could actually work if the base were made of pudding!
If the base were made of pudding, Eric we could just pull the sign right out.
Okay, get ready to run!
Huh.
Must be a dud.
Go find out.
- Why me?
- 'Cause you're super skinny.
If it blows up, you got the best chance of having stuff not hit you.
True, but on the other hand no one would be surprised if you blew yourself up.
That's a good point.
Oh,just move.
Here, you big babies.
Okay, what you just did, just there?
That was so hot.
I'd follow your fine behind into combat any day.
All right, look.
If we got Red's tools, I bet I could cut down that pole.
Casey showed me how to saw through rebar.
Our second date.
Wow.
I love those stories.
Hey, I'll just sneak into your garage, grab the tools.
Red'll never know.
Okay, but you gotta be really quiet.
Come on.
It's me we're talking about.
I'm like a cat.
Red.
Hey.
You're wonderin' why I'm goin' through your stuff.
Okay.
That's- See, I needed, uh, to borrow your saw because I need to chop down a tree.
Because there's something stuck in it.
An animal.
A rabbit.
There's a rabbit stuck in a tree.
And I want to return that rabbit to the wild so it can lay its eggs.
Kelso, rabbits don't- How the hell did a rabbit get up a tree?
Uh, Eric threw it up there.
Eric threw a rabbit up a tree?
Yeah.
He's a sadistic bastard.
You know he hit a cow?
You know, you've been in a bad mood all night, man.
I'm gonna cheer you up.
Ah, boo!
Ah, boo!
Aw, you don't know what's funny.
Oh, hey, uh, I can work tomorrow night if you want me to.
You're not working tomorrow, man.
It's your birthday.
Yeah, man, my 1 8th birthday.
Otherwise known as the beginning of the end.
The black hole, man.
It's the death march.
Look, if there's a war, I could get drafted.
If there's a war, I'll see you in Canada.
That's not the point, Leo.
I mean, there's other stuff too, you know.
Hey, don't get snippy with me, man.
Hyde, we need you to settle an argument.
I'm sure you know by now that we're throwing you a party.
What party?
Okay, I'm sure you know by now that we're throwing you a party.
So, what kind of theme would you like?
Throw whatever party you want, man.
I'm not gonna be there.
Well, if that's his attitude, I don't wanna do anything.
I quit.
You can't quit on me.
I quit on you you bossy little midget.
Don't even.
- What the hell?
- No!
No!
Excuse me, little boy with glasses.
That's our sign.
Um, excuse me, big dork with Farrah hair.
No, it isn't.
''Farrah hair''?
If I look like any of the Charlie's Angels, it's Jaclyn Smith!
Wow, that's true.
Hey, there, little fella.
What if I told you that I had $20 for a special someone if they gave us the sign?
- Nope.
- A month's supply of candy?
- Nope.
- What if I show you my bra strap?
Okay.
Okay!
Here.
I bet if I showed him my whole bra, he would have given me his bike.
These things are awesome.
That was hot.
Man, why is she so hot today?
'Cause you can't have her, 'cause you lost her, 'cause you're stupid.
Wait.
Um,Jackie cheated on you, right, with a little, tiny cheese guy?
Hey!
Truce, okay?
- Yeah, I think that's best.
- Yeah.
Hey, if you hadn't blown it with Donna -you'd probably be doin' it with her right now.
-  Yeah.
!
You know who's probably doin' it?
Jackie, with the cheese guy.
We had a truce!
Wow.
Yeah, this place looks great.
Fez,Jackie, the decorations are beautiful.
No.
No, no, no, no.
They haven't been here all day.
I did this because I'm feminine too.
I'm a lady.
Why can't anyone freakin' see that?
Oh, honey, no.
It's perfect.
Okay, the next time I need a feminine touch, I am using you and Fez.
What happened to those cupcakes?
Bob, there were a dozen cupcakes there.
I'm sorry, Red.
They're like vitamins to me.
Hey, you guys.
Bad news.
Hyde said he's not coming.
He's just sitting in the basement.
Oh, but it's his birthday.
He can't be alone on his birthday.
Red?
I agree.
Eric, you go home and sit with Steven.
Oh, okay, fine.
I'll go get him.
Surprise!
We got him, dudes.
All right.
Get your butt up those stairs and over to your party.
I'm not goin'.
Steven, you're 1 8 now.
It's time to start being a man.
And the first rule to being a man is you gotta spend your life doing crap you don't wanna do.
Like right now, I don't wanna be here talkin' to you but I am.
And you don't wanna go to a party but you will.
Actually, I won't.
What's the matter?
You don't like parties?
Me neither.
But as long as you're livin' under my roof you'll do what I tell you to do.
Well, lucky for me, I won't be under your roof much longer anyway.
What the hell you talkin' about?
Well, I'm 1 8.
I should be getting out of here, right?
I mean, that's what my dad did and my uncle did and my cousins did.
They were all on their own when they were my age.
What are they doin' now?
Uh, pumping gas, prison, prison, dead, prison.
And the reason you're living here is so you don't end up like them.
But if you want to leave, I can't stop you.
So, what's it gonna be, Steven?
Prison, death or a birthday party?
I guess I'll go to the party.
Thanks, Red.
You're welcome.
And, uh don't tell Eric that we had this little conversation.
'Cause when he's 1 8, he's out.
So, punch.
Yep.
Oh, fine.
Everybody, they're here!
They're- Shh!
Shh!
Surprise!
You got me, dudes.
Wow, thanks.
Oh, happy birthday.
Damn,Jackie!
Stop kissing other guys!
Wow, this is great.
Did you get this at the flea market?
- The flea market?
- Yeah, they sell 'em there for two bucks.
No, we stole it.
It took forever.
I had to show my bra!
You owe me a bumper!
Now, I made this for you.
See?
It says ''Steven'' on the front because I heard that having your name on your clothes is cool.
Plus, if anybody finds it, they can return it to you.
So, I won't be able to lose it.
- Great.
-  Put it on.
Do I have to?
You bet your ass.
Welcome to manhood.
Mrs. Forman I'm not really a pinata kind of guy.
Oh, come on, Steven.
Everyone plays pinata.
Yeah, Steven.
Hit the jackass!
Ow!
Hey!
Steven!
Just listen-
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
Okay, my friends.
Invitations to see Fez in tonight's Spring Sing charmingly illustrated by the hand of Fez.
Great, something to put my gum in.
Just kidding.
Oh, man, this concert's tonight?
Yes, it's tonight.
I've been talking about it for weeks!
- Don't you listen to me?
- Fez, I don't know what you're getting so upset about.
- You know we don't listen to you.
- Yeah, I don't know, Fez.
I mean, I'm still kind of tired from the party last night.
Party?
What party?
You know, the party.
You were there.
No, I do not know, and I was not there.
- Someone forgot to tell me.
- Wait, are you sure?
'Cause I could have sworn you were there.
Remember when the college girl got up on the table and took her top off?
- What?
- Yeah, that was great, man.
Wait, even Smokey the Bear was there?
Fine.
Fine, what's done is done.
The important thing is where you're going to be tonight- at my concert watching me.
Oh, it's gonna be such a wonderful evening.
Music, good friends and dancing.
Just like life should be.
This is my favorite part.
So, what do you think?
I think whatever you're on, I'll take two of'em.
Hangin'out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We're all all right We're all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
!
Perfecto.
Oh, Fez, was that you?
I could have sworn I just heard Wayne Newton.
Mr. and Mrs. Forman!
You came to my concert!
Well, it's the Spring Sing.
There is no place we'd rather be than the Spring Sing.
Now, Kitty, that's just a lie.
Ay, here comes my music teacher, Mr. Wilkinson.
He is unpleasant.
Are you the parents of this horrible little man?
I'll have you know, he's been imitating my accent behind my back.
Well, first of all, we are not his parents and second of all- Well, the rest of it, I just don't care about.
I'm moving you to the back row so that no one can hear that squawk box that you call a voice.
The back row?
But the back row is for the untalented and the ugly!
- Ay, you are no fun.
- Music is not about fun.
It's about passion and commitment.
Have you ever been moved to tears by the warbling timbre of your own voice?
No, because I am a man.
Well, he just, um- He doesn't seem to like you at all.
The British have always hated my people.
We won the war, buddy.
Get over it!
Oh, good one, Fez.
Well, you certainly seem in high spirits.
Of course.
Soon all of my friends are gonna be here and we'll be all like a family.
I wish you were my family.
Oh, we would be so happy together.
Okay, kids, it's nighty-night time.
- Good night, Mom.
- Night, Ma.
-  - That's my mama!
I love you, Fez.
I love you more!
I love you the most!
Daddy!
All right.
Sleep tight.
And don't let the bed bugs put their foot in your ass.
-  -  Okay, boys, lights out.
!
And no more staying up till 8:30 giving each other hugs!
-  - See you in the morning.
- Are you people singing again?
- Yes?
Good, 'cause-    -  -   Well, that was detailed.
You are one fruity kid.
Now, remember singing is all about the use of the diaphragm.
-  -   And what's so funny about the proper use of the diaphragm?
It's the muscle you breathe with.
- Below your bosom!
-  Oh!
Bloody imbeciles.
So, this must be a very exciting night for you.
Yes, yes.
If the mayor likes what he sees I'll be directing this year's Dairy Days Dance-abration.
Oh, that is always wonderful.
One time, they had a quartet dressed as cows and they sang ''Blue Moo-oo-oon.
''  'Cause they were cows!
Yes, I'm sure you thick-headed Americans could hardly contain your grunts.
Well, I thought it was delightful.
Hey, everybody!
Bob!
Hey, I saved seats for you and the gang.
- Oh, I don't think they're coming.
- Of course they are.
Well, you know, I asked if they needed a ride, but they said, ''No.
'' When I left, they were just sittin' in the basement, laughin'.
But the show's about to start.
Ooh!
Then I better get to the refreshment table.
Did you know that all that stuff was free?
It says donations accepted, but you don't gotta put nothin' in.
My friends are still in the basement?
- I wonder what they're doing.
- Oh, I'm sure they're just- Miss Kitty, please!
I'm trying to wonder.
Ooh, guys.
Fez's concert is about to start- Which means we have three more hours without his sorry ass!
Let's eat his candy!
Yeah.
My name is Fez.
I love candy.
Whore!
Good day.
I said, good day!
Yeah, and the best part is, that idiot actually thinks I'm his friend.
Like I care.
I wish he were dead.
Oh, hey, we should kill him!
No, I got a better idea.
Let's sing without him!
-  -  Yeah!
So, they would rather make fun of me than come here.
Well, honey, you know, at least they're singing- like you'll be doin' real soon.
Is there a bar here?
You know, last night they went to a party without me- a topless party.
- What?
- Where?
They were the first people to be nice to me when I came to America but maybe I am not their friend.
Maybe I am just a goofy foreign kid.
Well, can't you be both?
I would settle for friend, but I don't even think I am that.
Well, you still got ''goofy foreign kid.
'' That's something.
Well, the butts are in the seats but not one butt is the butt of a friend.
Well, this is just rude.
They better have run out of gas or hit a deer or something.
Okay, places everyone!
Let's show them what we've got.
Teeth and cleavage!
Teeth and cleavage!
Well, that does it!
Now I am mad!
All they care about is themselves and their stupid, messed-up relationships.
Boo-hoo!
Love hurts!
Well they deserve it!
Aw, geez, not another one.
Do we really have to go see that foreign boy sing?
I'm not going.
I'm in too much pain from our breakup.
Even though it was months ago, it still affects every part of my life.
Me, me, me!
No!
Me, me, me!
Wait.
What about me, me, me?
- Me!
- Me!
- Me!
Me!
-  -    Wow, I just caught the end, but that was nice.
- Leo, you made it.
- What, this?
No, I got this at a church sale.
Hey, where's that dude and that other dude, and that girl and that dude, and the other girl?
They're not here.
It's just me alone- always alone.
Aw, forget it.
I'm going home!
Hi, Fez!
Where the hell have you been?
Well, we were on our way here when we passed by your music teacher's house.
And I said, ''Fez hates that guy.
Let's toilet-paper it!
'' So- So we did!
- For me?
- Yeah, and then we had to go get some dog poop 'cause we looked at his porch and realized, ''Hey, Not enough dog poop.
''   There's enough dog poop now.
And we got you an opening-night present.
- Congratulations, buddy!
-  Bloody hell, is that my mailbox?
Bloody 'ell, is that me mailbox?
-  That's dead on!
- Yes, I'm sure you'll all remember this fondly as you rot in your Barcaloungers cheeseburgers clenched in your fat American fists!
You got that right, buddy!
Aw.
Look who has so many friends!
Don't ever leave him alone with us again.
I'm so glad you came.
Tonight wouldn't mean anything without you guys.
Aw, Fez, we wouldn't miss it.
- I mean- -      Boy, do I know how to shake it.
Imbecile, you're on!
Well, that's my cue!
This is just like A Star Is Born, and I am Barbra Streisand.
Love me!
I'm so happy to be back home with my friends.
No, nobody calls you that.
And if anyone's the space cowboy, it's me.
What?
In your dreams, Forman.
I am widely acknowledged as the space cowboy of this group.
And I also call ''midnight toker.
'' Wow.
This cheeseburger is bloody brilliant.
Dude, come here.
Good, 'cause-   Cut.
!
- You had it!
- That was your best one!
-  Cut.
!
-
{END OF EPISODE 24}{START OF EPISODE 25}
Okay, boys.
I brought cheese samples from work.
What's wrong with them?
Nothing.
Well, they were in the trash.
- Cool.
- Hand it over.
Hey.
You know how my brother locks me in the closet with a pillowcase full of dead fish until the stink makes me cry?
Well, while I was in there, I heard him make a phone call.
And it seems that he's got a little surprise for Donna tonight- the honeymoon suite at that French motel in Kenosha.
The Le Motel?
Oh, no, it sounds like Donna and Casey are going to ie do it.
Oh, yeah.
Eric's gonna freak out when we tell him.
- And why would we tell him?
- To watch him freak out.
Kelso, he's gonna take it really hard, man.
- So we just need to keep our mouths shut.
- Wow.
That's very considerate of Eric's feelings.
What the hell, man?
I just think we all need to zip it, especially you.
Hey, I can keep a secret.
I didn't tell Kelso you took five bucks from his wallet.
Hyde!
None of you guys can keep a secret.
Well, you sure can, especially when it's about you kissing other guys.
Michael, it was one guy from work, and I told you I 'm sorry.
God, how long are you gonna keep throwing that in my face?
Well, how long are you gonna keep throwing your face in other guys' faces?
Wow.
That was clever.
I think I won that!
Yeah!
Oh, Eric.
Let me just say I 'm sorry.
- For what?
- I can't tell you.
But if you were to guess that Casey is taking Donna to a honeymoon suite I'd say, "Good guess".
' Wait.
Casey and Donna got a motel room?
Yeah, but look at the bright side.
Donna and Casey may be doing it but at least they're doing it on a vibrating, heart-shaped bed.
If you see what I mean.
Well, I do now thanks to your spot-on, detailed description.
Oh, and there'll probably be a mirror too.
Okay, thanks, Fez.
- You know, so they can watch each other.
- Yeah, I know.
I 'd like to propose a toast.
My divorce papers finally came through.
- To divorce!
- Oh, no, no.
No, no.
If you're gonna drink to divorce, drink alone in the dark like regular sad people.
I'm not sad.
I'm happy 'cause now I can do all kinds of things I couldn't do before, like, uh- Joanne, we could get married.
Somethin' funny?
Bob, we've never mentioned marriage before.
You spring it on me now in front of strangers?
Oh, excuse me.
My mistake, I guess.
I guess I hurt someone's feelings.
Well, you certainly did.
We are not strangers!
So, what are you and Casey doin' tonight?
He won't tell me.
It's a surprise.
Oh, honey, it's blush, not spray paint.
A surprise, huh?
What if the surprise is something big?
Are you ready for it?
I mean, how do you really feel about Casey?
I don't know.
Well, how do you feel about his hair?
Love it.
Lots of body.
- And his body?
- Love it.
Lots of hair.
- How about his car?
- I love it.
Trans Ams kick ass.
So hair, body and car.
The big three- the Holy Trinity of Love.
Okay, I think you're ready for your big surprise.
Jackie, what is this big surprise?
All I can tell you is definitely- definiteiy shave those legs.
Well, I called the Le Motel.
Fez, you were right.
Casey has a reservation for tonight.
And, Hyde, you were right.
I cannot keep a secret.
Speaking of secrets, look what I found in Jackie's cheese.
Some guy Phil's phone number.
I -I can't take this anymore.
I just know it, Hyde.
She's cheatin' on me again.
Kelso, don't jump to conclusions.
Maybe I don't care.
Forman, man, you gotta be cool about this Donna thing or she's gonna know you're jealous.
You can't be all Simon and Garfunkely.
You gotta get Bruce Springsteeny.
Springsteenian.
Springsteenicious.
Wait.
What are we talking about?
Whoa.
Hey, you guys, I 'm not jealous.
I'm just looking out for her.
I mean, Donna's practically a sister to me.
A tall, shapely sister who I've done it with about a million times.
Look, maybe Donna and Casey won't even do it tonight.
I'd call it 50-50.
You would?
Oh, I'd be wrong.
But I'd call it that to keep you from doing somethin' stupid.
Forman, you gotta do somethin' stupid.
Sittin' around feeling helpless all day- That isn't healthy.
That's why I'm gonna stalk Jackie.
You know, I really love things with holes.
Swiss cheese, doughnuts, inner tubes.
I don't know what it is about a hole.
It just feels good.
-  -  Hello?
Is Phil there?
- Who?
- Phil!
Some guy you kissed!
I found his number in your cheese!
Michael, Phil's the guy who delivers the sausage.
You tramp!
No, idiot.
He brings food to our store.
He's our sausage guy.
Tramp!
Wait- Who's that singing?
Who's singing love songs to you?
Peter Frampton.
Are you kissing him?
- No!
-  -  - Are you sure?
-  - Hello?
Hello, this is Norman.
Shall we kiss?
Okay, Red, what Bob needs right now is a good friend.
And since I don't know where we're gonna find one, you need to talk to him.
- Kitty- - Or you can talk to Joanne.
I 'll take Bob.
I'll take Joanne.
Donna, I have to talk to you!
Leo?
Have you got Donna in there?
You know, I didn't think to ask.
Look, I have to find Donna.
Casey's gonna surprise her with the honeymoon suite.
And I know Donna.
She's not gonna like that kind of surprise.
So she'll probably be looking for an out, so I'm here to rescue her.
Kind of like Luke did with Leia in Star Wars.
You know, "I'm here to rescue you"!
The other honeymoon suite's across the hall, man.
Now, ifyou'll excuse me, I've got a game of Twister I gotta stretch for.
Casey, check it out.
They have tiny soaps.
What am I doing?
I couldn't do it, Leo.
Donna's havin' a good time.
She doesn't wanna be rescued.
But you know what?
The thing is, I still wanna go in there and stop everything, you know?
I didn't come here for her.
I came here for me.
That's a huge dilemma, man.
But you know what you really gotta ask yourself?
Is there anybody who's not in a motel room with three women that you could tell this to?
Okay, here's the thing.
Bob really likes you.
Why?
Who knows?
But that's America.
Any kook can have any damn fool idea he wants.
Look, I haven't had good luck with marriage.
When my first husband and I were dating, he was great.
But as soon as I married him, he turned into- well, something like you.
Well, I don't know what kind of crap your ex-husband used to pull but whatever it was, Bob doesn't have it in him.
He's just a nice, loyal guy with a big heart.
He's perfect for a pushy gal like you.
Well, he does have a big heart.
And we do go well together.
You know, Red, if I didn't know any better, I 'd think you were a good guy.
Well, if I didn't know any better, I 'd think I cared.
The red cheese is chewy.
The red cheese is wax.
Oh.
Hey, guess what, fellas?
Turns out I still have feelings for Donna.
Yeah.
Deep feelings.
Warm feelings.
Tingly-in-the-pants feelings.
And I can't do anything about it, because she has those feelings for someone else.
I think that admitting that you still love Donna is an important step because it reopens the door for this:  Eric loves Donna!
Eric loves Donna!
Look, you guys, I don't love her.
I just think that if she's not with me the fairest thing for everyone is if she's alone and unhappy.
No!
That is a bad plan, man.
'Cause if you leave a chick alone, the next thing you know she's lickin' the roof of some other guy's mouth.
Like the cheese guy.
I hate that guy!
But you love his cheese.
See, this is just like a Southern tragedy.
Tennessee Williams, but with cheese.
I 'm taking advanced English.
Oh, man, I gotta go to the mall.
I'm late to stalk Jackie.
I just- I can't believe Donna's in a motel room with him right now.
Man, I don't like it either.
But there is one thing you can do.
I believe you have a stack of Playboys underneath your bed.
Go use 'em.
Okay, Bob, I think the problem is that Joanne thinks you're moving just a little too fast.
That's just who I am.
I do everything fast.
I run fast.
I drive fast.
I eat fast.
Okay, what happens when you eat fast?
I get gassy.
Right.
Okay, well, a relationship works the same way.
When it grows too fast, it- it gets gassy too.
And-And- And then the bad thing happens and people leave the room.
Wow.
A lot of people have told me to slow down but nobody ever said it in a way that spoke to me.
- Hi, Bob.
- Hey, Joanne.
Okay, well, we'll just, um- We'll leave you two alone.
Okay, well, there will be no more marriage talk from Bob.
What?
There'd better be.
She's expecting it!
- Oh, crap!
- Lock the doors!
I 'm on it!
Michael!
What are you doing?
- What, are you spying on me now?
-  No!
Okay, fine.
Yeah, I 'm spying on you 'cause you're around strange guys all day and apparently, every once in a while, you up and French one of'em.
Michael, go home.
This is a place of business.
And if you don't have any business, you're not welcome at the mall.
Fine!
Stay away from my girlfriend!
Michael, what are you doing?
Well, I can be at the mall now, 'cause I got business.
Train business.
You have lost your mind!
Yep, and I don't miss it!
Michael, look at you, riding around on a kiddie train so you can spy on me.
I mean, do you not see how crazy this is?
Well, yeah.
But I-I don't know what to do.
I mean, I'm a mess.
I can't sleep, I can't eat.
Well, I can eat.
And then when I eat, I get kind of sleepy.
But I am really upset!
Look, ifwe're ever gonna get past this, you have to forget about that stupid little kiss and just try- try to remember that we love each other.
- I know.
- So can we please, please just finally move on?
I wanna say yes, but it's like we're on this track and we keep going around in circles like some kind of- some kind of- I don't know.
I lost my train of thought.
Okay, Forman, what were you doing at the Le Motel last night?
And don't say you weren't there, because Leo saw you.
Wait, wait.
Leo thinks he saw me at the Le Motel?
-  - Cut the crap, Eric.
You know Casey and I had a room last night so you went there and you pulled the fire alarm all night until we left.
Fire alarm?
I didn't- I didn't pull- Wait.
You guys left?
So you guys didn't- No!
We spent all night in the parking lot with Leo and his hooty mamas.
Eric, what were you even doing at the motel?
I don't know.
I just- I was fine, right?
I mean, we were friends, and that was cool.
And now, Donna, all of a sudden it's like the day after we broke up all over again, and- Look, I'm sorry, but when I knew you were gonna be with Casey, I just- I felt- Whatever.
No, I get it.
Remember when you wanted to date other people, and I was so cool about it?
Well, I wasn't.
It, like, broke my heart.
- So what did you do?
- Well, I didn't know what to do.
- So, I just, you know- - Right.
Casey.
Right.
Hey, look, from now on, I 'm gonna stay out of your business.
- I promise.
- Thank you.
But before that promise goes into effect I would like it duly noted for the record that I think Casey's all wrong for you and I think you guys are moving way too fast.
Duly noted.
- And I 'll stay out of your business too.
- Okay.
Good.
So I better, uh, drum me up some business, huh?
Still sleepin', huh?
Gosh.
Pulling fire alarms all night must really wear you out.
That's right.
I'm on to you, buddy.
You did a nice thing, and I'm tellin' everybody.
Oh, man, I didn't do it to be nice.
I did it because I always wanted to commit a felony.
Misdemeanors just ain't the rush they used to be.
Well, all I hear is "I love you, I love you, I love you".
'
{END OF EPISODE 25}{START OF EPISODE 26}
Oh, Hyde, get this.
Casey just came by to pick up Donna and he was out in the street just revving his Trans Am real loud and then he peels out in the street and he started doing doughnuts.
And then, out comes Donna, all smiling and, like, looking at him.
What a slut!
Look.
If she wants to date him, that's fine.
But he doesn't have to be all loud and jerky about it.
Jerky, loud, doughnut jerk.
Oh, guess what, boys.
I entered the big wiener contest at the Piggly Wiggly.
And I won a year's supply of all-beef hot dogs!
I'm a wiener winner!
Well, anyway, we're having a barbecue.
No, Kitty!
I thought we were going to talk about that.
Mm-hmm.
Oh, and I saw Donna at the grocery store and she said she's bringing her friend Casey.
What?
No.
I hate Casey.
He's Donna's new boyfriend.
Y-You have to uninvite him.
Dad, tell her.
Kitty, you've done a horrible thing.
It could scar the boy for life.
Now, let's do the right thing and cancel that barbecue.
No.
We're having it, and it'll be fun.
And we just- We won't give Casey any relish.
All right!
Once Casey finds out he's not getting any relish, he'll dump Donna for sure.
You are so screwed.
So your mom invited Casey over for hot dogs?
Well, that's a plump, juicy all-beef burn.
Ah, it's just typical women stuff.
LikeJackie kissing that guy.
Ow!
- Hyde!
- Yeah.
Okay?
I've decided if anyone brings up any more stupid girl stuff I'm gonna throw something at 'em.
This time, I threw a fist.
I'm sorry.
It's just everything reminds me.
Like, last night Rocky was on and I was thinking I'm like Rocky and Jackie is Apollo Creed.
And she bashed in my face by kissing that guy!
At least Rocky wins in the end.
Kelso, Rocky loses.
Oh, yeah?
Well, why is he jumping around all happy?
Because he goes the distance, fool.
He loses the fight, but he wins in life.
Who wants to watch a movie with a message like that?
Ice-cream man!
You guys, I've been thinking about Donna.
And I- This time I threw a magazine.
No, guys, seriously.
This barbecue might work out in my favor.
You see, Donna's only seen Casey around his smelly, tattooed Molly Hatchet-lovin' friends.
But when he comes to the barbecue, he'll be around us- good, clean, Lynyrd Skynyrd-lovin' Americans.
And the comparison will not be kind to him.
And then Donna'll come running home to you.
No.
Well, maybe.
You think?
So, instead of pounding Casey like you should, you came up with this zany scheme.
Forman, you've officially turned into Daffy Duck.
You're ''dithpicable''!
You know, I have lady problems too.
Rhonda won't let me get past second base.
I even said, ''please.
'' Magic word, my ass!
Y-You know what, Jac- I can't do this.
Why should I paint these round, berry toes if some other guy is gonna end up lickin' 'em?
Michael, what are you talking about?
I still can't get over you cheatin' on me.
And I need to hear you apologize again.
And this time, maybe you should cry or give me money!
No, Michael.
I am not gonna beg for forgiveness.
I didn't make you do that when you cheated.
Well, that is totally different.
When guys cheat, it's because they need some hot action.
But when girls cheat, it's way worse, 'cause girls don't even like sex.
We do too.
Well, why aren't we doin' it now?
Because I don't want to do it right now.
I do.
Point made.
Thank you!
No.
You know what?
We need help.
We should consult the world's highest authority on relationships.
Cosmo.
!
''Why you should touch your breasts every day.
'' No, this could help.
They seem smart.
Okay, Fez, when Casey gets here, ask him for advice about your second-base problem.
My advice is gonna be way better than his, and, uh Donna will see that he's a greasy dolt.
Hey, Forman, I have an idea.
Set up a wacky system of ropes and pulleys and when Casey gets here, drop an anvil on his head.
- Because that's what Daffy does.
- Yeah, I got that.
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.
Hey, Foreplay.
Getting a little shaggy up there, buddy.
Okay.
Well, that's enough of that!
Okay.
So, uh- Hey, you guys are just in time.
Fez was telling me about, uh, some kind of problem you're having with Rhonda.
Yeah.
Rhonda won't let me get past second base, and I really want to explore further.
Mmm.
Gosh.
Well, I don't know I think if you're patient, and you're respectful when Rhonda's ready, she'll, uh- she'll wave you over.
Well, thank you, Eric.
That is very gentlemanly advice.
Gentlemanly?
Well, uh, guilty as charged, I guess.
Hey, Casey, uh, what do you think?
Well, sometimes a seasoned lady like Rhonda she's gotten used to the usual order of things.
So, I think the next time you're fooling around just, uh, skip second and go right to third.
- What?
- It's genius!
No wonder you never get any.
Yeah, with Rhonda, you know, that just might work.
W-Wait, you like that?
Well, the words are wrong, but they sound so good coming out of his mouth.
I got a way about me.
That worked out-  ''thuper.
'' Okay, Michael.
I found something out about our situation.
This article says that cheating is a symptom of a deeper problem.
Deeper problem?
No!
I don't want a deeper problem!
I want a quick fix!
Well, too bad.
Because I realized that I'm still hurt and angry from all the times you cheated on me.
Okay?
And that is why I kissed that guy.
So what are you saying?
I'm sayin', I'm not sorry.
I'm not sorry!
Come on!
Look, now I know why I cheated.
You need to read this Cosmo and find out why you did.
I ripped out the boob pictures, so don't bother looking.
Hey, Donna, uh, would you like a hot dog?
Um, maybe half.
Whoa, man, you carry a knife?
Yeah.
You never know when a lady's gonna need a half a hot dog.
It's funny man.
You're the Boy Scout, but I'm the one who's prepared.
He's like a gladiator.
Okay, that's it.
I'm bringing out the big guns.
Oh, yeah.
I'm introducing him to my folks.
Oh, hey, Mom, meet Casey.
This is Donna's new boyfriend.
Well, you're certainly not a girl!
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Forman.
You know, you couldn't have picked a prettier day to win a year's supply of hot dogs.
Yeah, sure is a hot dog.
Mom!
Sorry, honey, it's just- He's just- I am sure you are much smarter.
Kitty, the idiot neighbors drank all my beer.
Uh-oh.
You're in a bad mood.
Hey, meet Casey.
Pleasure, sir.
Hey, maybe I can help.
I always keep an spare case of beer in the Trans Am.
Little tip I picked up in the army.
I don't know.
Seems like a pretty good kid.
Uh-huh.
So, you and Casey, huh?
Look, Hyde, whatever you heard about Casey, he's changed now.
He's- He's mature.
Oh, yeah.
He's real mature.
Well, I like him!
We're together, and if you can't deal with that, then you can just go to hell!
Hey, that's not barbecue language, young lady!
Here's that beer, sir.
I got a soda for the minor.
Now, you make sure to drink that real slow 'cause I don't want you to get a tummy ache, little guy.
Well, that's thoughtful.
- Yeah, he cramps up easy.
-   -  - Casey and Donna, man.
Hey, remember when we were 1 2?
We didn't even like girls yet.
I liked girls when I was 1 2.
Yeah, I was happy to stay at home Friday night in my underwear just tossin' a football to myself.
Yeah, never did that either.
Well, at least I gave it my best shot, right?
If Donna loves Casey and not me, then, I mean, I guess it's over.
Wha- Forman, you can't give up.
Okay, look.
Who knows what's gonna happen with me and Jackie.
But what you and Donna had?
That was, like, real.
And I'm telling you, as his brother- Look, Casey is bad news.
He's either gonna get bored and split, or something worse is gonna happen.
So, you gotta do something.
Hey, since when did you get all serious?
Been reading Cosmo.
It's very educational.
Yeah.
I never realized how much plumbing girls had down there.
Like, there's this diagram, and it's like a map of Six Flags.
Okay, everyone.
Here's lunch.
Hot dog soup!
No more hot dogs!
I'll just eat the grilled cheese.
You mean, grilled cheese with hot dogs!
Kitty, for God's sakes I ate 1 4 hot dogs yesterday!
Well, what do you want me to do, Red?
They're everywhere.
They're a curse on this house!
Oh, fine.
Let's make some calls.
Maybe we can unload the damn things on a nursery school.
You guys, I have let this thing with Casey go way too far.
Yeah, no kidding.
Donna's pretty far gone.
She's starting to lash out at people at barbecues.
You gotta kick his ass, man!
Hyde, Eric cannot beat Casey with his fists.
He's a special boy who must beat him with his special strengths.
Now, let's think.
What is Eric's special strengths?
Welcome back to TV's favorite game show- Get Into That Box.
!
Now let's meet our returning champion, Eric Forman!
Thanks.
Good to be back, Fez.
Let's meet our challenger, Casey Kelso!
Casey Kelso, it's time to-  Get Into That Box.
!
How does he do it?
He's so tiny!
I would watch that show.
Okay.
That was great.
Guys, I'm going over to Casey's.
And I don't know what I'm gonna do.
But if things get physical, I'm just gonna have to drop the hammer.
And if all else fails, kick him in the stones and run like hell.
Yeah, that's what I meant by ''drop the hammer.
'' Rhonda, your lively tongue has made me thirsty.
Would you like to wet your whistle?
Wow, thirsty lady.
Well, we're off to a nice start.
Shall we move on to second base?
Ay, no.
Guess what.
I read your little ''everything's my fault'' article and I realized why I cheated.
Remember the first time I kissed Pam Macy?
- Behind the gym?
- And in the gym, and in her car.
But, anyway- Earlier that day, I didn't have any money to buy you Tater Tots.
You said that I'd never be able to support you, 'cause I wasn't smart enough.
You're always puttin' me down like that, and it makes me feel bad about myself.
And that is why I cheated.
That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard!
Just like that.
And then I thought about it, and I realized that I'm not sorry either!
Hey!
Michael, what are you saying?
I'm sayin' that we're not right for each other, because you make me feel bad!
And- And- I don't think I can be with you anymore.
I want to break up.
Wait, break up?
No, no.
Michael, I was wrong.
Please, let's talk about this.
- No.
- Wait, but Michael!
Casey, we need to talk.
Well, I'm a little swamped right now, Foreplay.
I think Donna thinks you love her and if you don't, you shouldn't act like you do.
What are you?
The love police?
Hands up!
Love police is here.
Hey, all I'm saying is that if you don't love her just don't be with her, okay?
Because she's a really special person and someone out there could really love her.
Someone out there or someone right here?
Oh, hey, Eric.
What are you doing here?
He was just leaving.
Oh.
Well, I gotta go too.
Hey, Pinciotti.
Love ya.
Oh, well, I- Thank you.
Okay, well I'll, uh, I'll see you later.
You see, Forman, it's just words.
You don't have to mean it.
If you make her cry, I'm coming right back here to kick your ass.
Well, me and Jackie are officially over.
We're as done as this hot dog.
This hot dog isn't done!
Well, if kicking Casey's butt is the same as babbling at him from a safe distance then, boy, did I do it!
But seriously, you guys, the days of Daffy are over.
It's time for action.
I'm goin' Road Runner on his ass.
Beep, beep!
Pow!
Good.
Because thanks to his stupid advice, Rhonda dumped me.
I tried to steal third, but she blocked me and choked me.
Now there is no more baseball for Fez.
It's back to handball.
Girls, man.
They'll make you miserable.
Well, I got a date.
''Tho'' long, ''thuckerth!
'' It's like Playboy but girls look at it.
I know.
How hot is that?
Oh, look.
Six Flags!
Well, that better not be a dirty magazine.
Oh, Cosmo.
Good for you.
Cosmo?
You boys are spending too much time together.
{END OF EPISODE 26}{START OF EPISODE 27}
So, Mr. Hammond said it was fine for me to miss class 'cause I'm already getting an ''A.
'' So just as you suspected, Mom I am better than everybody.
All I know is, my little boy was very brave at the dentist today.
Wasn't he?
Yes, he was, my ''wittle snicklefwitz.
''  Okay, Mom, uh, when a boy reaches a certain age the baby voice no longer comforts him.
It urges him to kill.
- Shh!
Shh!
- Okay, let's, uh, get you some coffee.
Nobody pukes in the Trans Am.
Mrs. Forman.
Uh-oh, you look mad.
What did Eric do?
Bad Eric!
Donna?
Why aren't you in school?
No worries.
I called her in sick.
I told 'em ''lady troubles.
'' No questions asked.
Oh, hey.
Easy there, wobbles.
Have you been drinking?
I hope so.
'Cause if not, this whole place is a-spinnin'!
Hang on, boys, it's a twister!
Hangin'out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you We're all all right We're all all right Hello, Wisconsin.
!
So, my mom and I were at The Hub getting ice cream and we caught Donna with Casey skipping school.
And she was drunk, in the middle of the afternoon.
It was like- It was like Sue Ellen on Dallas.
You went to The Hub for ice cream with your mommy?
Why would you tell me that?
Hyde, the point is, he went for ice cream without us.
You cannot pick up a phone?
You know who can't pick up a phone?
Jackie.
I broke up with her and she never calls to even say hi or to offer me sad, but hot break-up sex.
I mean, that's just selfish.
Guys, my mom's over at the Pinciottis' right now telling Bob about Donna being drunk.
You can't do that kind of stuff in the middle of the afternoon.
It'll mess with your-your-your- your-your-your- thinking thing.
You know what I'm saying.
Yeah, you got to stay sharp, man.
That's why I keep myself pure until 3:00.
That's why I keep myself pure until 2:00.
I'm not wearing a watch.
Hey, you know what?
Donna getting busted is actually great for me because now she's got to realize what a jackass Casey is.
And when she dumps him I'll be standin' right here with open arms and a gentle ''I told you so.
'' Oh, yeah, that could happen.
After all, I mean I made that girl a woman.
I madeJackie a woman like, a thousand times.
We stole dead fish.
Dead fish?
What are you going to do with dead fish?
You're missing the point, man!
We stole dead fish!
Ah, you just don't get it.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- I just came by- - I miss you.
- What?
- What?
- Did you say you missed me?
- No.
- Look,just say you miss me.
- Fine, I miss you!
Michael, I miss you too.
And look, I was thinking, since we broke up because I kissed another guy what if I let you kiss another girl?
I mean, we would be even, and we could get back together.
Jackie, if you think that me kissin' another girl is going to bring us closer together I'm totally willing to make that sacrifice.
Thank you, Michael.
- Yeah.
I better go wash my face.
- Okay.
Ah, this fish is so stinky.
What the hell are we going to do with the stinky?
It's simple, man.
We're gonna find a place to hide the stinky and ruin someone's day.
Now, question is: where, how and who?
The answer is: there, that and Kelso.
Oh, it's like a bowl- a bowl for the stinky.
And we will put it, and he'll never find it, and it will smell forever!
What the hell's going on with you?
You're grounded!
No arguments!
Dad, I'm not grounded.
Okay, well, then, whatever you think is best.
No, not whatever she thinks is best.
You are grounded.
Hey, you're not my mother.
You have no say in what I do.
Well, she's got you there.
Okay, let's see.
Which chick do I want to kiss?
Oh, no, no, no, Michael.
I get to pick the girl.
But you'll pick an ''uggo.
'' You didn't call ''no uggos.
'' Hey, I just thought of something.
Your plan's good and all, but what if the girl that you pick doesn't want to kiss me?
''Doesn't want to kiss me''!
And then I told Donna she was grounded, and she said no.
She said no?
Can you do that?
No.
I need your help, Red.
I gotta get Donna away from that guy.
Oh, Dad, you know what's good?
Threaten her with the old foot in the ass.
You know, that Casey.
How can such a bad influence live in such a handsome package?
Bad people should have a- a big scar or an eye patch so you can recognize them.
The problem is you know, there's a point when your kids realize you can't do nothin' to control them.
There is?
No.
Now stop listening.
Bob, I don't want to get involved.
I've got enough problems with the 1 4 kids who think they live here now.
Why do I have to hold the fish?
Because that's what the little buddy does.
Oh!
Oh!
Someone's coming.
So the guy's trying to tell me that his Z28 is the same car as my Trans Am except for the decals.
How can people be so ignorant?
I see you, Donna!
I see you!
- Dad.
!
- Don't ''Dad'' me!
You're not going anywhere, not with this guy.
You're grounded again.
- How much did we miss?
- Shh!
Just started.
Dad, I'm gonna do whatever I want with whoever I want whenever I want to do it!
We have to have a talk right now, Donna.
Mr. Pinciotti, sir, let me just say that you're making a lot of sense here and I think that when I bring Donna home tonight you two ought to sit down and really hammer this thing out.
- Okay, that sounds fair.
-  What?
- You're just gonna let her go off with him?
- What else can I do?
Oh, good God, that's it!
Everybody in the living room.
Now!
Not you.
Bob, get in here!
Donna, what has gotten into you?
Skipping school, showing no respect for your father.
- That's right.
- Shut up, Bob.
Okay, here's snacks.
So, um, anybody need a drink?
I'll take a rum and Coke for the road.
Hey, hey, buddy, little tip?
I think booze is what got you in trouble in the first place.
How could you take this girl out drinking in the middle of the day?
Well, you know how it is.
All the older girls were at work.
Can I just say this guy is not boyfriend material.
I agree.
You're not going out with him anymore.
You two are done.
- No!
- All right.
- What?
- You got to admit this has been a real hassle.
I mean, it was fun and you're a great girl but let's just call it a day.
Wait, you're breaking up with her?
Casey, I thought you said you- -you know, you said you loved me.
- Yeah.
I have this thing where I say stuff I don't really mean.
- Casey- - Look, Donna I see what you're gettin' at, and I'm not that type of guy.
Mrs. Forman, what say we rain check that rum and Coke?
Donna, I'm- I'm really sorry.
You're not sorry.
You got exactly what you wanted.
- Ow!
- Ohh!
Eric, someone here to see you.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Okay.
Can I get anyone a snack?
- Mom.
- Right, right.
Have to stop doing that.
So, um, how are you?
Humiliated.
I'm such an idiot.
I got dumped in front of the whole world.
I don't- I don't even know what I said to your mom at The Hub and I hate that she saw me like that.
What is wrong with me?
Hey, nothing.
Look, your mom left.
Come on, you're- you're allowed to freak out.
Everybody warned me about Casey, and I fell for him anyway.
And he's such a jackass.
You know, I really, really wanted you to figure that out,just not like this.
Eric, I'm just- -  I'm so sorry.
- Hey.
I was so stupid.
- Eric, we should be together.
- Wait, what?
Let's just, like, forget all this other stuff happened.
Wait.
Wait.
Donna, I mean if you come running back to me now I- Donna, I can't be your second choice.
But you're not.
Eric.
Oh!
Oh, where am I?
Mmm.
How about I kiss her?
No way.
She's too tall, too tan, too rich.
Damn,Jackie, I don't want to kiss a short, pale, poor girl.
Okay, look, Michael, all I know is I don't want to stay broken up.
Oh!
Okay, you know what, you choose.
Kiss any girl you want.
I choose you.
Michael, that is the most romantic thing I've ever read, heard about or seen on TV.
Yeah, it was pretty romantic.
I could tell while I was doing it.
- Oh, God.
- What?
No, it's just- Look, one week you break up with me, and the next week you're Prince Charming?
I'm an incredibly complex man,Jackie.
Michael, I can't do this anymore.
Look, Michael, if you want to choose me, then choose me.
I mean, really choose me.
Let's get married.
What?
Michael, all our problems are because we haven't decided we're gonna be together forever.
So let's decide.
Hold on.
You want to get married?
Yes, Michael!
Yes, I accept!
Oh!
Oh, my God!
You know what?
I gotta go tell my dad.
And you-you have to buy a ring.
Just think about it: We are going to be the Burkhart-Kelsos!
The Who-hart What-os?
Michael and I are getting married!
Yeah, we heard.
That's why we're decorating the van.
But- But not with fish.
Ow!
Let me get this straight.
Donna wanted to get back together and you said no?
I said no.
You said no?
Dumb-ass!
Look, I have my reasons, okay?
What could they be?
What could they possibly be?
Casey dumps her and she comes to me?
Okay, I'm not a rebound.
So you're too proud to take her back?
And what do you have to be so proud of?
You're not an athlete.
The only smart thing about you is your mouth.
And look at you.
Red- Red, he looks fine.
He's just so darn stupid!
I'm- I'm very upset.
!
Well, stop, okay?
Because, I already feel bad enough as it is.
- Well, you should.
- Well, I do!
I love her.
God, why do I always have to screw these things up, you know?
Why does everything always have to be my way?
That's why we broke up in the first place.
Uh-huh, well, we've all known that for a year!
Okay.
Okay, I have to tell Donna how I feel.
Then go!
Oh, Red.
I know.
We're never gonna get him out of the house.
Donna?
Oh, hello, Mr. Pinciotti, Mrs.- I'm sorry,Joanne.
I don't know your last name.
I have something to tell you guys.
I love Donna.
Well, she isn't here.
We don't know where she is.
And-And it's Stupak.
Well, uh, if it's okay, I'll just wait.
Sure.
I always liked you.
Oh, thank you, sir.
But do me a favor.
Don't play with her undergarments.
Somethin' reeks!
Man!
- Where are you goin'?
- Bus station.
I'm going to my mom's in California.
Oh, my God.
You're runnin' away.
I don't know what else to do.
No, I know how you feel.
Jackie wants to get married.
To me!
What?
Look, a lot of people don't know this about us, butJackie's pretty much in charge.
So it might happen.
But it won't happen if I'm not here.
You know what, I'll drive you.
We'll both go to California.
Kelso, are you up for this?
Hey, if the Beverly Hillbillies can do it, so can I. Great, let's go.
Oh, my God.
What stinks?
This town, baby.
-  - We're leaving that smell behind.
Whew!
Kelso!
I'm not gonna tell you again!
Well, I was reaching for my soda.
Damn!
Man, Iowa smells like fish too.
Should have taken the bus.
