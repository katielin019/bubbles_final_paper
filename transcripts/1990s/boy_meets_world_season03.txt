{START OF EPISODE 1}
Shawn, we gotta get to school.
What?
You don't know the way without me?
Just come on.
Fine.
This pizza's bad anyway.
No, wait.
It's you.
Oh, no.
Too much cologne.
I knew this would happen.
Cologne.
Nice clothes.
The spinning.
How could I forget?
It's Wednesday.
T-day.
Topanga's back from her summer trip.
Oh, yeah.
So you're gonna do it, huh, Cor?
You're gonna ask her to be your girlfriend?
I really hope she says yes.
But come on, come on.
We're gonna be late.
Lateness.
A problem for me once.
That was, of course, until I got me a teacher roommate.
John!
Yeah?
Hey, Matthews, nice outfit.
Job interview?
Watch.
Listen, John, I'm dragging a little this morning.
I'm gonna need some extra time.
You think you could jot a note for me?
Sure.
No problem.
You know, anything you want - "late," "doctor.
" Have fun with it.
You got it.
- No way.
- What'd he write?
"No way.
" That's right, pal.
Your butt's in homeroom before that first bell rings or TV no way, snacks no way, dates no way.
OK?
Snacks?
I'm new at this.
Now, get out of here.
Shawn?
Aren't you forgetting something?
My books.
Shawn, it's a new year, a new me.
You notice the spring in my step?
- Boxer shorts.
- Oh!
- You wild man.
- Oh, yeah.
Cor, Cor, there she is.
Cory, what is this?
It's John Adams.
He was a president.
School namesake.
He was a father of our country.
Yeah, yeah.
Whatever.
Cor, why are you hiding?
No, I-I'm not hiding.
It's just Look at her, Shawn.
I mean, look at Topanga.
I thought I missed her over the summer, but I miss her even more in person.
Wow, she's pretty.
Well, come on, Cory.
Just go up to her and say hi.
You've known her your whole life.
Yeah, but that's not the Topanga I've known.
I mean, it's like she goes away for a summer and comes back a woman.
Yeah, so did Coach Franklin.
But that's another story.
Cory, look.
We have been over and over and over this.
Now, just walk up to her and ask her to go steady.
All right.
Here I go.
Am I moving yet?
All right, no skin.
Well, Mr. Matthews.
And how is the new president of the Film Society?
Proud.
Proud and dedicated.
Tell me why I'm doing this again?
Because extracurriculars look good on college applications.
Why?
My grades aren't good enough to get me into college?
Your grades, my friend, are not good enough to get you a Slurpee.
Mr. Feeny, do I have to show this movie?
I mean, Paint Your Wagon?
A cowboy musical?
Nobody's coming to this.
Yes, well, it's Coach Franklin's favorite film.
Hey, why can't I show something where people get, you know, slashed or gored or disemboweled, you know?
- Something with a story.
- No horror films, please.
Violent and twisted characters have no place on a high-school campus.
- Hello!
- Hello!
OK, off you go.
Crazy new kid swallowed his lunch money.
Luckily, Frankie's an expert at the "floor-lick" maneuver.
- Ain't that right, Frankie?
- Please, you embarrass me.
I'll see you gentlemen in detention.
Why, Mr. Feeny?
What'd you do?
Something in a previous life, I'm sure.
Yeah, I gotta say, Cor, Topanga's looking very hot.
Very fine.
Very Coppertone.
I got the idea.
All right, I'm gonna go for it.
Shawn, you're not next to me.
I must be moving.
Hello.
Cory, hi.
So, we're in all the same classes again.
Yeah, I I had a nice summer too.
Thanks.
Bye.
What just happened over there, Shawn?
I mean, I'm talking with you fine, but over there with Topanga, I became a a sea monkey.
That's a bad animal, man.
Hey, guys, guys, guys, guys You didn't hear, did you?
What?
What?
This year when the bell rings, it means get to class.
The Hunter boy giving you a rough time?
I suggest you send a note home to yourself.
All right, George, all right.
There's still a few bugs to work out.
But I'm telling you, until his parents show up, I'm glad to have him.
We had a great time over the summer break.
Well, the vacation is over.
The relationship must change accordingly.
Oh, come on, George.
You can't know everything.
How does he do it?
Cor, here's your chance.
Just ask her out for movie night.
Try and stop me.
Topanga.
Thanks for this.
- I saluted.
- We all saw.
Cor, you're making too big a deal out of this.
Just act natural.
You're right.
So, uh, Topanga.
- Friday night, what's going on?
- I don't know.
Neither do I. OK, then.
Shawn.
I did this.
Hey, hey!
Get off my back!
I'm trying to get into college here.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Shut all your traps.
It says Clint Eastwood's in this picture.
Singing.
Word around the halls is your ticket sales are a little lackluster, Matthews.
And to that end, we have a business proposition.
We'll take all the tickets and we'll sell the show out for you.
- Cool.
- For a piece, of course.
Piece.
Piece of what?
The profits.
You see, we've got our fingers in every organization in this school.
Except the mime club.
No, those guys give me the creeps.
Oh, wait a minute, I know what this is.
You guys can forget it, all right?
Hey, nobody says forget it to Joey the Rat.
Ain't that right, Frankie?
Help, Joey!
They got me in that box again.
Get out of here.
Get out of here.
Cory?
- Are you OK?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
Very OK, why?
All day you've hardly said a word to me, avoided eye contact, and did I imagine this or did you salute me?
You were in that rainforest a long time.
See saluting's in now.
Bob.
Steve.
Coach Franklin.
Cory, I know what this is about.
Why you're acting so strange?
It's about Friday night, isn't it?
Yeah!
Yeah!
Um So here's what I'm thinking.
We get a big group together, we grab a bite at Chubbie's - and then we're - Cory.
I'm going with someone else.
I sort of thought you knew.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I heard something about that.
Guess it just slipped my mind.
If you'll excuse me, I have to be in another place entirely.
Can you get me an orange?
Topanga has a date for the screenings.
You were right, Shawn.
I mean, you warned me this would happen.
- I did?
- Yeah.
You said Topanga looked hot.
And if I waited too long some other guy was gonna move right in.
- I did.
- I brought this on.
I can only blame myself.
I just wonder who asked her.
I did.
Huh?
I asked Topanga out.
You asked Topanga out?
What?
You said yourself, she's a woman now.
I can't talk to you right now.
Cool.
See you.
I was gonna ask her out.
Really, I was.
Tell me I'm dreaming.
Just send me a sign.
- Call this a sign?
- You bet it's a sign.
Come on, kid.
Lift your shirt.
Lift, lift, lift!
"Film Society screening Friday.
" Ten bucks a pair.
Cough it up.
Cough, cough, cough No, no.
This is not a good time, OK?
"Be there or be " " dead.
" It's catchy.
- It's OK, Hunter.
Don't get up.
- Well?
That's the best job interview I've been out on in months.
- All right, Eli.
So you got something?
- Yep.
The secretary's phone number.
I start Saturday night.
What about the job, man?
- Overqualified.
- Overqualified.
Eli, buddy.
When they kick you out of your apartment, you'll always have a place to stay.
- I appreciate that.
- That park across the street, man.
And they got new benches.
And we'd still be neighbors.
- All right, where is he?
- You don't believe in knocking?
No, I don't believe in anything anymore.
I demand to know where Shawn Hunter is.
- I'm right here, Cor.
- Aha!
I've found you.
- Is this about Topanga?
- What were you thinking, Shawn?
You do not ask out your best friend's girl.
- Am I right?
- How long have you been dating her?
- Never!
He didn't even make a move.
- Yeah, but I was going to.
This sounds like a clear violation of the gentlemen's code of dating.
Yes.
See, a true friend doesn't ask out a girl that his buddy likes or has just broken up with.
Right, John?
Yeah, well, you know.
Whatever.
I mean, there's always exceptions to that rule.
Yeah, and would one of these exceptions be a certain Miss Cynthia Harp?
Eli, will you let it go, man?
That was ten years ago.
Besides, you dumped her for that Spanish transfer student whose only word of English was "yes.
" - That was my favorite semester.
- OK, so don't be - That doesn't make a difference.
- Don't start Excuse me!
Knife in the back here.
All I did was ask out a girl who didn't have a boyfriend.
Which reminds me.
- I think I'll go call her and firm up plans.
- Oh, go ahead, Hunter.
Firm your little heart out.
Firm up your plans for Friday night.
And every night for that matter, my friend.
Or should I say my ex-friend?
I'm outta here.
Who's gonna tell him he's in the closet?
And I'm taking back my sweater.
Nice save.
Mom, I gotta ask you something.
Do you believe that opposites attract?
Well, yeah.
But it can never last, right?
Well, actually, Cory, your dad and I had nothing in common at first.
But then, the differences made it kind of exciting.
In fact, the first time we kissed was so incredible Stop.
Why did I even ask a woman?
They only bring you heartache.
Well, this one brings dinner every night, a roof over your head, and there was that little giving-birth thing.
Mom, that's getting real old.
You know, Mom, I'm sensing one of those brother-to-brother moments.
- I can take it from here.
- My pleasure.
He's all yours.
Thanks.
You know, Cor, a little song comes to mind that might be able to help you through these tough times.
Topanga's going out with Shawn Topanga's going out with Shawn Bite me very much.
Now, listen.
I still don't believe Topanga really likes Shawn.
In fact, I'm gonna call her and find out.
Yeah, yeah.
Why don't you just take the cordless up to the roof so after you talk to her you can jump?
You're really hurting, aren't you?
That just takes all the fun out of it.
I've never felt so horrible before.
I mean, I'm sitting here like this, and she's out there having a good time.
It makes no sense, Eric.
I gotta talk to Topanga and find out where I stand.
Look, Cory, Cory, Cory?
I got about ten seconds of sincerity left in me, so don't interrupt, all right?
Ask a girl what she's thinking, she'll feel cornered.
- So what do I do?
- Ask her best friend.
Straight answers, no pressure.
Time's up.
Oh, yeah.
Trini.
I was so totally, totally blown away that you asked me here today after school.
Considering how much I really bug you and all.
No, no.
Trini.
Um I really find your infectious, perky energy just Would you give me that?
Let an old ketchup-slapper help you out.
So, uh, what do you want?
Well, I need to ask you something.
Say there was this girl, who's always been despised by a certain guy.
I mean, they're complete opposites.
- But then, it's like, one day she just - Oh, my God.
I am so flattered.
- Why?
- Because you're asking me out.
Aren't you?
Uh Yes.
Yes, I am.
- Friday night.
Movies.
You and me.
- Do you wanna do dinner first?
No.
No.
I don't think I'll be hungry.
Uh, Frankie, Joey, what are we doing in here?
Like we told you.
Mr. Blue, Mr. Brown.
Come on.
Look, if you guys are collecting, the Film Society's broke, all right?
Nobody's buying tickets.
Maybe not from you.
But we have sold out.
What?
Are you kidding?
All these people bought tickets for Paint Your Wagon?
Paint Your Wagon.
Yeah, right.
Laugh with us.
Well, cheer up, Eric.
It's not the quantity of the audience, it's the quality.
Oh, shut up.
Well, I'd stay, but these mime people give me the creeps.
Mr. Blue, let 'em in.
Joey's Mr. Blue.
I'm Brown.
How don't you see that?
Come on, come on.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Keep it moving.
Keep it moving.
Sit, sit, sit, sit.
Hey, one to a chair.
One to a chair!
Nothing packs them in like a feel-good horror film.
Leon's Revenge.
- Don't forget about our little surprise guest.
- Oh, so Leon made it?
Yeah, but the airline lost his guts.
You should never check your guts.
Come on, Trini.
There are two over here.
Hi, Cory.
Hi, Trini.
- I like your hair.
- Oh, thanks.
- I think she meant Trini, Cor.
- Hey, you wanna step outside?
Cory.
Some people can't even make it through the cartoon.
You little badger.
Oh, great.
I've been gummed.
Hey!
How about that coyote?
What a moron, huh?
All right.
Well, on behalf of the Film Society, and their friends, we would like to thank you all for responding to the underground invitations stuffed into your lockers.
And now, here to introduce Leon's Revenge, the man you've all been waiting for.
He played Leon the Gut Sucker in parts one, three, and four.
Here he is, direct from the pits of hell, your worst nightmare.
Come on.
Here he is.
- Boo.
- It's Feeny!
Into the car, Mr. Brown.
Not until I find out what that monster's done with Leon.
Mr. Feeny, there's a very good explanation for this.
I'm sure there is.
Really?
'Cause, see, I was just kinda winging it.
Shawn?
I'll be right there.
- What are you looking at me for?
- Cory Matthews, what is your problem?
- You.
- What did I do?
Topanga, you only went out with my best friend.
Well, you didn't ask me.
Besides, you came to the make-out movies with my best friend too.
Yeah, but only to make you think I mean, I was just - Cory, would you just talk to me?
- I can't.
Don't you think I want to?
I mean, in my head this is so easy.
I've said it all summer long, a million times.
- Said what?
- I can't say it now, here, with all these empty chairs around.
Cory, it's just you and me.
We've know each other our whole lives.
We've always been able to talk.
That's what's making this so hard now.
It doesn't have to be.
Look, Topanga.
If I had to dream up the perfect woman, she wouldn't even come close to you.
Would you be my girlfriend?
Yes or no?
Man, it's about time.
You're lucky this whole thing worked, Hunter.
I almost had to kiss him.
Wait, it was a setup?
Come here.
Oh, thank you.
Now go back there, you little sea monkey.
So.
Where were we?
You little badger.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
This looks like it, Shawn.
I think it's gonna happen.
She's taking the necklace off.
Ooh, locket in the pocket.
Come on, come on.
"And I never want to see you again.
" - And I never want to see you again.
- Yes!
Yes!
Veronica Watson is back on the market.
- All right, but you better act fast.
- No, no.
I I should respect what she and Dennis had, and give her time to get over it.
All right, then.
Veronica, I saw what just happened with you and Dennis.
Look, if you're asking me out for Friday night, I really don't think I'm ready.
Yeah, I understand.
- How's Saturday?
- Perfect.
Beautiful.
I'll pick you up at eight.
That was a good move because word of their breakup was bound to spread quickly.
Veronica!
Sorry.
I'm busy Saturday.
Busy Saturday, she is.
Busy, busy, busy.
Man, I wish I could be a fly on that wall.
- Maroon, you're gonna be there.
- Even better.
- But I'll ask my parents if it's OK.
- Why would you do that?
Because you're staying with us this weekend, remember?
- Mr. Turner's going out of town.
- What?
I never heard that.
Shawn, I was standing right there when he told you.
Where was I?
Look, my parents are cool when Topanga's over.
You know, until ten o'clock.
A ten o'clock curfew.
Cory, that means if I pick her up at eight that only gives us Oh, that stinking metric system.
John!
John!
Boy, it's good No, it's great to see you.
You just saw me in class 20 minutes ago.
Then why the heck do I miss you so much?
- Tell him how good he looks.
- You look good.
Have you dropped a few LBs?
- Not my stereo again.
- Nope, still drying out.
- So, listen, my friend Cory over here.
- Hi.
He tells me you're going out of town this weekend.
What do you mean, he told you?
I told you myself.
Remember, I looked you right in the eye and I said, "I'm going out of town.
" "You're staying at the Matthews'".
Don't you listen?
What?
Do you listen?
- He's asking if you listen.
- Oh!
Oh, yeah, well, I try.
John, we talked about this.
When adults talk I hear this buzzing sound.
Well, then I'll talk over it.
I'm going out of town.
My buddy Chris is getting married.
You're staying at the Matthews'.
I rented a tuxedo.
You got me?
People get married every day.
- Excuse me, Shawn, may I?
- Please.
How many times does a guy get a date with Veronica Watson?
That's right, Mr. Turner.
The Veronica Watson.
Oh!
Oh, well, look, I'll just cancel.
Did I?
Yeah, yeah.
I'll return my nonrefundable plane ticket.
My buddy Chris will just push back his wedding.
That way, the world can make Shawn Hunter happy.
Oh, come here, man, I want to thank you.
You really touched me, man.
Are you kidding me?
You're staying at the Matthews' this weekend.
You got me?
Yeah, I got you.
Saturday.
No.
A date with Veronica Watson at your house.
Cory, what's the point?
Excuse me, Shawn.
Let's just say a certain Topanga Lawrence has never complained.
I mean, sitting on the couch, the two of us have enjoyed many a Blockbuster night.
- With your folks there?
- Look you just worry about Veronica, I'll take care of the rest.
I'm gonna dedicate this date to you, man.
- How do I answer that?
- Oh, Mr. Turner.
A reminder.
Please start Monday morning's staff meeting without me.
It was the only time I could get in to see the dentist.
Sure, George, no problem.
- Anything serious?
- No, just a checkup.
Actually, I find a visit to the dentist oddly pleasant.
Well, maybe they'll find a cavity, then you can really party.
Oh, Mr. Matthews.
A question.
Uh Who's the French guy that fixed the milk?
The clock is ticking, Mr. Matthews.
What the heck are you talking about?
A piece of unfinished business.
That ten-page paper you owe me.
What?
The semester just started.
You never said anything about a paper.
Louis B. Pasteur.
Huh?
I'm talking about the paper that was due last year.
Oh.
I forgot about that one.
Came up with that milk guy, though.
You saw that.
You were here.
Now, I suggest you get that paper to me by Monday, or your incomplete will become an F completely.
It's not gonna happen, Mr. Feeny, I've been working on it all summer.
Up here.
- Where it's safe.
- Yeah.
Yeah, it's on something called the "Manhattan Project"?
Yeah, OK.
I'm gonna need overnight delivery.
A bibliography?
Yeah, what the heck?
Slap one of those puppies on there.
No, thank you, Carl.
You guys provide a real service.
I love you, man.
All right.
"Term papers by Gerard.
If you get a D your paper is free.
" "Credit-card orders accepted.
" Eric, you don't have a credit card.
Oh, I do now.
Some bank sent me one.
What, are they stupid, or what?
Like I got the money.
- What, no calls?
- Oh, right, Topanga called.
Sounded important.
Said she'd be at the number for, like, a half hour.
It was about an hour ago, so I didn't write it down.
Eric, I've been upstairs all afternoon waiting for that call.
How could you do this to me?
Settle down, Cory.
You're acting like this is the first time.
- Well, it's the last time, bub.
- Hey, little bro.
Life's tough.
Get a helmet.
Hunter!
Hey, you're staying with us this weekend.
That's great.
You guys don't spend enough time together.
Why don't you guys just wear, like, one big shirt?
- What did he sit on?
- Just forget about him.
Listen, all systems are definitely go for you and Veronica tomorrow night.
- Deets, man.
- All right.
My parents made reservations at the Hillside Grill.
- Ah, fine steak there.
- Indeed.
However, due to circumstances beyond their control - me - their reservations have been canceled.
That means at least an hour wait.
I'm thinking by the time they get home, you'll be on your second date.
- That's great, Cory.
- What are you doing?
- I'm resting my lips.
- Huh?
I'm resting my lips.
Thanks.
Now I have to start over.
Oh, Shawn, you have great lips.
- They're so - Well-rested?
Oh!
Pretend I'm not here.
- OK.
- Shawn.
- What?
You heard her, she's not here.
- Oh, but I am.
Take a breather, Shawn.
Mom, Dad, you can't possibly be home this early.
You had reservations at the Hillside Grill, right?
Yeah, we did, but they lost them.
Turned out fine, though.
We found a great little place right across the street.
Yeah, cozy booths, candles The most romantic meal I can remember in the longest time.
And in under 90 minutes.
- They still open?
- We can take a hint.
Come on, Alan, let's go make some coffee.
No, no, no, I'm OK right here.
Ooh, fly fishing.
Just messing with you.
It's great, great.
Now you're all alone again.
Good.
Oh, me?
Sorry.
I think that's the last of them.
So where were we?
Oh, I don't know about you, but I was right I got it!
I got it!
I got it!
- Mr. Matthews.
- All right.
Mr. Feeny, welcome to my date.
I thank you.
Mr. Matthews, look what was accidentally delivered to my house.
- You almost got away with it.
- Away with what?
Did you actually think your little ploy would work?
I mean, I thought I had a chance.
I had this moment of weakness.
I was - What I have in my hand - I know, Mr. Feeny.
- because of a delivery foul-up - I am so sorry, Mr. Feeny.
is a receipt for three dollars and 75 cents.
Pay up, bucko.
I can't get anything past you!
Hello?
Here you go, Mr. Feeny.
Here's a five - you can keep that change.
Oh, joy.
Early retirement.
Shawn, is this the weirdest date you've ever been on?
Not really.
On one blind date I got fixed up with my Uncle Mary.
Long story.
- Hey, George.
How are you?
- Just in time for coffee.
- Oh, I don't mind if I do.
- Oh, good.
It's decaf, though, it's not People.
People, people, please!
Can't you see the man here is on a date?
I mean, that's Veronica Watson, for crying out loud.
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Don't make me come back there!
I'll pull this car right over.
Don't think I won't.
My God, I'm turning into my father.
All right, we're here.
You think you could take it around the block a few more times?
Out.
Good night, Veronica.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
Shawn, aren't you forgetting something?
Oh, yeah.
Sorry.
No!
The door.
Walk your date to the door.
- I don't think so.
- Why not?
I get out of this car, I ain't never coming back.
Shawn, forget it, the date is over.
Just take another shower.
I can't.
I used up all the cold water.
Cor, I gotta get out of here.
I gotta see her.
Now there's a shock.
I can't believe it.
Shawn Hunter breaking curfew.
You know, I was thinking, one night when you stay here, could you actually Oh, I don't know stay here?
Cory, your mom and dad are down there making out!
God bless 'em.
They're blocking my escape route.
How am I gonna get out of here?
- Oh, Shawn - Let me think.
Let me think.
I could climb up the chimney, over the roof - Shawn.
- and down the drainpipe.
- Shawn!
- What?
!
My parents are in the backyard.
- That's what I've been trying to tell you.
- Yeah, so that means my front door, that big hunk of wood in the front of my house, is wide open.
Cory what exactly are you saying?
I'm saying you could go out the front door.
Me go out the front door?
You know, that's so crazy it just might work.
Prepare to enter Hotel del Shawn.
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
- Oh, this is bad.
- This is bad.
- Is this bad?
- It's pretty bad, honey.
Look, Jonathan, this isn't what it looks like.
- What is it?
- Well, um See, you're her favorite teacher and she wanted to see where you live.
- Nice.
- Yeah, well, that about wraps up this tour.
- Next stop, Feeny's.
- Stay.
Shawn, what do you take me for?
Jonathan, how about I leave now and I'll drop this girl off?
OK.
All right.
Thanks, Kris.
- I'll call you later.
- All right.
Shawn, what could you possibly be thinking?
Well, you saw her.
There's not much to think about.
You were supposed to be at the Matthews'.
Shawn, if I can't trust you OK, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I really am.
I I just thought Hey.
Hey, wait a minute, how was the wedding, pal?
- That's not the point.
- Yeah, yeah, Pittsburgh.
The Big Apple, the City of Angels.
OK, look, we're getting a little off the subject here.
Yeah, that tuxedo, does it come in tuxedo?
Hey, enough!
I'm the adult here, you're the kid, remember?
What's that mean?
You can lie and I can't?
Look I need a little privacy, OK?
I got my own life, you know?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't know I was cramping your style by living here.
This is my place!
I don't have to defend myself.
Yeah.
Yeah, your place.
That says it all.
Shawn!
Hey!
Jonathan, was that your motorcycle or did the shuttle just land?
I'm sorry, George.
I didn't mean to wake you.
I'm looking for Shawn.
Yes, well, I always knew that arrangement of yours had the potential of ruining one's private life.
George, my private life is far from ruined.
I meant mine.
George!
Where do you keep your towels?
Well, as I said I'll be late Monday morning.
Dental appointment.
Dental appointment?
She is my dentist.
Hi, Jonathan.
Great to see you, always a pleasure.
Now is not a good time, OK?
Bye-bye.
Wait, wait, Alan, Alan.
It can't wait.
- I'm looking for Shawn.
- Right now, right this moment?
Yeah.
Come on in.
Shawn!
Could you come down here please?
As you probably can tell, I am not Shawn.
- Where is he?
- Well, that's the beauty here.
I don't know.
And you know what?
I am glad I don't know where he is.
For once I don't have to cover for him.
Feels good telling the truth.
- Good night, everybody.
- Good night.
Aren't you supposed to be in Pittsburgh?
Yeah.
Yeah.
- That hurt.
- What hurt?
Well, I messed up.
I told Shawn a little white lie.
I told him I was going out of town for a wedding, and actually I didn't go anywhere.
I stayed here with a date.
Ooh, let me guess.
Shawn showed up with his girlfriend at your apartment and caught you and your date.
- Oh, you're good.
- A lot of years, pal.
Alan!
The bathtub is full.
The champagne is poured, the candles are lit and Jonathan's here.
- What a sweet, wonderful surprise.
- I'll be right up.
Oh, great.
Then we can finish that conversation we were having.
Night-night.
Sorry.
So am I. Listen, I'm gonna take off.
I'm gonna go look for Shawn.
Oh, really?
Where?
I don't know.
Alan, what the heck was I thinking when I asked Shawn to come live with me?
I'm a single guy.
I'm not ready to be a parent yet.
Hey, I got three kids and I'm still not ready.
Jonathan, I've seen you with Shawn.
You're great with him.
I wasn't so great an hour ago.
So, you made a mistake.
You didn't break him in half.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
You're only human.
Yeah, why do I feel so stupid?
Well, welcome to the parent club.
Alan Matthews, member since 1978.
What got you in?
First time, Eric was four.
I lost him in an amusement park.
He rode the Colossus for six hours.
The Colossus?
The one with the Mm-hm.
And then the Yeah, you're gonna make mistakes.
The trick is learning how to deal with them.
Huh.
The Manhattan Project didn't even happen in New York, it happened in New Mexico.
What a bunch of goofballs.
Call it the "New Mexico Project," who's gonna know?
I could've been a scientist if I wanted.
Six hours, huh?
Round and round and round and round Where were you?
Another wedding?
I was out looking for you.
Yeah, well, I took off.
I realized there was no place to go, so when I got there I came back.
So here you are.
Now what do we do?
- You tell me, you're the adult.
- Hey, listen.
I'm new at this.
I'm just making this up as I go along.
I mean, you didn't come with instructions there, Shawn.
You lied to me.
Yeah, I did.
Shawn, I'm sorry.
I should have just been straight with you.
You were no angel, by the way.
bringing back girls to empty apartments.
- So, what are you gonna do?
Kick me out?
- Shawn, come on.
Every time one of us messes up doesn't mean somebody's got to take off.
We gotta talk these things out, OK?
So look, we both messed up, all right?
We'll just do it right next time.
John, do you ever feel like the walls are sort of closing in and you got no place to go where you can just be alone?
Yeah.
That's probably why I tried to run my little scam.
Yeah, it's why I ran mine.
Look, if you want to be alone with your girlfriend, you can just tell me.
- I can find things to do.
- Legal things?
In certain states.
OK, I believe you.
And if I wanna be alone with my girlfriend, you'll get lost too, right?
Hey, I had to take a shot.
- Are we OK?
- Yeah.
We're good.
It's your move.
- Veronica's behind the couch, isn't she?
- Man, I was that close to telling you.
Yeah.
- Hi, Mr. Turner.
Nice place.
- Yeah.
Huh?
Veronica Watson!
Ah, Mr. Matthews, there you are.
I've just graded your paper.
You know, Mr. Feeny, I don't know if it was the topic or I was just in the right mood, but I almost enjoyed writing this paper.
Interesting, yes.
But your assigned topic was the Manhattan Project.
The paper in my hand with your name on the cover is about Abraham Lincoln.
- It's the strangest thing.
- Uh, wait, uh What?
Well, if I recall, this is a copy of a paper written by Shawn Hunter last year.
The Best Beard in History.
" I particularly liked his comparative analysis.
"Colonel Sanders -what's up with that"?
Hey, Mr. Feeny, see, I paid for this paper.
I mean, I wrote this paper.
I mean All right, look, Mr. Feeny, you got me, OK?
I ordered the paper through a term-paper writing service I saw in the back of a magazine.
Ah.
- Term Papers by Gerard.
- Yes.
- They're good.
- Wait, that still doesn't explain I mean, how did my paper get switched with Hunter's?
Hey, big bro.
Life's tough.
Get a helmet.
Excuse me, Mr. Feeny, I've got to go make some more room at the breakfast table.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
- Cory, stop - All right, all right.
Nice level stroke and just kiss the cue ball.
Softly.
Very softly.
Uh I'm thinking darts.
All right, now The key to this game is to be very gentle with the dart and let the air do the work.
Like this?
Sorry.
Uh - Maybe it's safer if we just talk.
- Yeah.
No one ever got hurt talking.
Oh, um - Are you cold?
- A little.
Here.
- A perfect fit.
- Yeah.
Just like us.
You know, Cory, I wasn't sure what to expect, but moving from friends to boyfriend and girlfriend has been real easy.
Yeah, and fun.
I think it's because we've been such good friends for so long.
So, Cory, are you feeling what I'm feeling?
- I think I am.
Topanga?
- Yeah?
I love you.
Did you hear what I said?
Yes.
Can we go now?
- What happened to you?
- It's the weirdest thing.
Last night I'm sitting at Chubbie's, right?
I'm looking deep into Paula Balboa's chestnut eyes.
I lean forward, about to make my move, when some yahoo hits me in the butt with a dart.
You you - You didn't see who it was?
- No.
Lot of sick people out there, man.
So, how was your night with the lovely Topanga?
It was good.
Good.
And the other 20 percent?
Well, I I may have kinda gotten caught up in the moment and said some things that maybe I shouldn't have said.
Cor, did you get emotional with Topanga?
It was hard not to.
I mean, she looked so beautiful.
You didn't tell her that, did you?
N- no!
Say she's beautiful?
Yeah.
Like I'd say that, Shawn.
I said, "I love you.
" - What?
What, what, what?
- You idiot!
Once word gets around what you told Topanga, every girl's gonna wanna hear it.
- What?
"I love you"?
- Sh!
You're like a stinking canary!
Come on, Shawn.
I mean, I don't believe telling Topanga I love her is gonna affect anybody but me and her.
Hey, Eric, Eric.
Guess what?
Cory told Topanga he loved her.
Oh!
Grandma Topanga, what's not to love?
You have such an adorable little brother.
I sure do, don't I?
Christi, I'll catch up with you, OK?
OK.
What could you possibly be thinking?
Christi's gonna expect me to tell her that I love her.
Oh, man, I gotta do something now.
Think.
You gotta think, Eric.
Ow.
- Thinking cramp?
- Yeah.
- I get those, too.
- All right.
Christi, I love you.
Christi, I love you.
Christi, I I don't even know her last name.
Great, I gotta think.
Ow!
You see, Cor?
Thanks to you, dating as we know it at John Adams High is over.
But everything's all right with me and Topanga.
Are you kidding me?
From this moment on, Topanga will be a gushing, love-struck puppy, hanging on to your every word.
I really have to go.
You see?
Don't think you're getting away with this!
- Oh, go away.
- Stop right there.
Hey, captain, what is your beef?
My beef, captain, is that you just snaked my coffee.
Hey, I put my money in, the cup dropped, the coffee poured.
It's my coffee.
- How much money did you put in?
- A nickel.
Precisely, a nickel.
I had just deposited 75 cents and I turn my back for a moment to get some more cha - Give that back.
- Hey, hey, hey.
Eli, Eli.
- Just a second, Jonathan.
I got a situation.
- Yeah, yeah, more than you know.
Remember that interview I set was with a Mr. Feeny?
Yeah, you know what?
I can't wait, 'cause the first thing I'm gonna do is tell Feeny he's got a little mustached man power tripping all over his hall.
Feeny, right?
Hi.
Coffee?
- Oh, Topanga.
- No!
Shawn, are you insane?
You bull rushed me!
I had to, man.
Don't you know what you're doing?
Yeah, there's something wrong between me and Topanga and I want to find out what it is.
- Not by giving her these.
- Here.
Look, Cory, I've been doing some thinking.
Ow!
The problem with your relationship is Topanga's got all the power now.
What power?
The power you give up when you say, "I love you.
" But I do.
I mean, what's wrong with saying how I feel?
- What's wrong with telling someone - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, b-b-but, look.
The longer you can go in a relationship without saying those words, the more power you hold.
- It's in books, man.
- What books are you reading?
Men Are from Mars, Women Want to Blow Mars out of the Stinking Sky.
They're after us, Cor.
Be warned.
So, this power, how do I get it back?
- Wait her out.
Make her come to you.
- But she's avoiding me.
- Exactly.
She's laying low, making a list.
- What list?
The whipped list of all the things she wants you to do.
You know, walks on the beach, going to the Pottery Barn, drinking International Coffees.
Have you tried the Viennese Mocha?
It's great.
It's happening.
Cory, I want you to wait her out.
I don't want you going near her.
And in the meantime, I want you to make a list of your own.
Things you want to do.
Yeah.
Yeah, like yard sales and antique shops Cory!
I just want her to like my list.
Eli.
Eli, wait.
- Come on, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
- Let go of me.
Was it that bad?
I stole his coffee.
I didn't kill anybody.
Man, I'm sorry, Eli.
I still think you would have made a great teacher, though, man.
Why?
I mean, I have nothing to say to kids.
I don't even understand kids.
But you know how to communicate, man, and you know how to do it honestly.
And that's what got me fired from producing the Six O'Clock News.
I'm trying to show people what's really going on with slumlords in Philadelphia and the station manager's saying: "Well, let's see more of that woman that walks to work naked.
" Which is exactly why you'd make a great media arts teacher, man.
Getting to what the truth is.
That's what these kids need to hear.
They aren't gonna be hearing it from me after that session in hell with Mr. Mustache.
I prefer Mr. Feeny.
- Is he there all the time?
- All the time.
Man, haven't you put me through enough?
Not nearly.
- You start on Monday.
- Start what?
Mr. Williams, you show great passion.
I think our students will benefit from a teacher who's actually lived his subject matter.
So, congratulations.
Come on, George.
Even I gotta say, quit yanking the guy.
I yank you not.
To tell you the truth, Mr. Williams, you remind me of another dedicated young man who was filled with fire and fury.
George, you mean me?
I mean me, you egomaniac.
Shawn, Shawn, you were right.
Where did you learn how to speak French?
I'm an idiot savant.
You didn't know that?
Cool.
Anyway, good news.
I've got the power back.
- Oh, Topanga came to you.
- Yeah, yeah.
She left me this note.
She said she wants to meet me here and talk.
Huh?
Huh?
I could write a book of my own.
I'll call it Shawn.
I Hardly Knew Me.
Man.
You really are an idiot savant.
Hi, Cory.
Oh.
Hi, Topanga.
- Can we talk alone?
- Sure.
- Alone.
- Alone.
Cory, this isn't easy for me.
Well, you know, relationships are hard work.
I mean, they involve planning, communicating, a lot of give-and-take.
I don't think we should see each other anymore.
Was that give or take?
I'm sorry.
It's over.
Goodbye.
So, how does it feel to have the power back, huh?
This makes no sense.
Sweet, beautiful, never-hurt-anyone Topanga Lawrence dumped me.
- I was wrong.
- I thought we'd be together forever.
- I thought I'd never be wrong.
- This isn't about you.
Wrong again.
I'll deal with my pain in my own time.
Cor, let's reenact the night of the date.
Maybe there's something I missed.
Well, we were in the back room at Chubbie's holding hands Come on.
Show me exactly.
Pretend I'm Topanga.
Not gonna.
You want answers, do it.
There's nobody around.
Just do it, come on.
Big hands.
OK.
Cory, how do you feel about me?
- Well, I-I want you to know - Yeah.
that I love you.
Can't a couple of guys have a little privacy?
So what did you do after Topanga said she loved you?
- Well, she never actually said it back.
- She didn't?
No.
Isn't that strange?
No, this is great.
You left out the most important part of the puzzle.
- So now you can help me?
- Are you kidding me?
It's over.
Look, Cory.
Here she comes.
Don't let her know you're hurting so bad.
Laugh with me.
- What?
- Laugh.
- Matthews, Hunter, stand up.
- I didn't do it.
Get up.
Hunter, who's your best friend?
You are, sir!
- Matthews, who's your best friend?
- Shawn is.
And what do we do to people who mess with our best friends?
- Kill 'em?
- You're right.
And with that, I would like to introduce Mr. Eli Williams, your new media arts teacher and my best friend.
Mess with him and die.
Eli.
Thanks, John.
Now what?
- You're the teacher.
- OK, um.
Well, I guess, if nothing else, I'm here to teach you to find the truth in the media.
Because there is a difference between what they say and what is real.
That was very good.
Watch this.
Hunter, what did he just say?
Something about Israel?
Is that great?
I mean, let's face it.
TVs and newspapers are not always honest and without honesty, well, you're nowhere.
Honest?
Let me tell you a little story about a kid from Philly who was honest.
You see, he said what was in his heart and then the fu I'm sorry.
Was that out loud?
OK.
Back to Israel.
Cory, dinner was over a half-hour ago.
Yeah, it was delicious, Mom.
- Cory, what's wrong?
- I might as well tell you.
I mean, you're gonna hear about it anyway.
See, last night I was out with Topanga.
We were having a really nice time so I figured, "Why not go for it"?
Go for it?
Cory.
Wh-what are you saying?
I went too far with Topanga.
Oh, my God.
How did this happen?
She looked so pretty, Mom, and there we were all alone in the back room at Chubbie's Mom!
No, no.
That's not what happened.
Well, all right then.
Look.
I-I just told Topanga I loved her and she didn't feel the same way.
Hi, Mrs. Matthews.
Sweet little Cory.
Guess where we were.
- Pottery Barn.
- Where?
Pottery Barn.
Pottery Barn.
Eric, show them the ceramic cat.
Later.
Tell me again.
I love you.
I'm gonna make you eat that ceramic cat.
You can wash it down with the napkin holders.
I miss her, Shawn.
I really miss her.
- You've got to let it go, Cor.
- But everything reminds me of her.
Cor, don't do this to yourself.
Get her out of your head.
There is no Topanga.
You have no idea.
Look, Cory, everybody gets dumped.
- Have you ever been dumped?
- Me?
Are you kidding?
I'm Shawn.
I need to be alone.
I gotta think about this.
Fair enough, but before I go, I got one more thing to say.
That was nice.
What did you say?
I don't know.
I just speak it, I don't understand it.
Later.
This place?
It's crawling with kids.
Yeah, they spray once a month, but they keep coming back.
Now I'm real hungry.
Come on, man, the food here's not that bad.
Besides, I don't mind hanging with the kids, you know?
Make myself available in case there's ever anything they want to talk about.
Hey, hey, hey, there's that weird kid that freaked on me during class.
- Yeah, Matthews.
- What was that about?
- Go ask him.
- Oh, right.
Then he answers, we bond and I have myself a little 14-year-old friend?
No, thanks.
That's not gonna happen to me.
Hey, whatever you say, man.
- So the food here is good?
- Oh, yeah, sure.
I'll talk to Chubbie, see if he'll order out for us.
Matthews, right?
So, that freaking out stuff, that was just for the new guy?
Sorry about that.
I'm sort of having a bad day.
Really?
'Cause you hide it so well.
See, I told my girlfriend I loved her and she dumped me.
I- I-I shouldn't have said anything.
Well, didn't you mean it?
Well, of course I meant it.
She knows that.
- Then you've got nothing to apologize for.
- Yeah, I got nothing.
No girlfriend.
No jean jacket.
- Well, why did she break it off?
- She didn't say.
All she said was, "It's over.
" What I can't figure out is Look, I know she cares about me, too.
Sounds like she's not being honest.
There's more story out there.
Go find it.
What's the use?
She won't come back to me.
Yeah, maybe not, but without the truth, you got nothing.
And without your jacket, well, you're just cold.
You know, I'm sort of glad I freaked out on you today.
All right, get out of here.
Matthews.
Just keep it honest.
And don't come back here begging me for advice either, man.
- Cory, what are you doing here?
- Look, Topanga.
Now that it's over between us there are a few things of mine that I want back.
- My jean jacket.
- Fine, take it.
Now go.
No.
There's one more thing.
- I don't have anything else of yours.
- Yeah, you do.
You have all my feelings about you and I don't have any of yours.
So everything I've ever thought about you I want back.
What are you talking about?
I mean, I thought I could open up to you and tell you how I feel.
So I said I loved you.
So what?
It was the truth.
And you just blew me off without any explanation.
Without telling me how you feel.
You know, I thought I knew you, Topanga, but I was wrong.
I was scared.
What?
You wanted to know how I feel.
I was scared.
- Of me?
- No.
Of what you said.
I mean, we're only 14 years old.
These feelings When when did you know?
Promise you won't laugh?
Do you remember the time when we were in my backyard chasing fireflies?
And you had, like, 20 in your jar and I had one, with a broken bulb.
And then Eric came outside and started teasing us He said, "Cory loves Topanga.
" And you said, "Yuck, I hate her.
" - That's when I knew.
- Cory, we were only six.
Who cares?
How could you know then?
I'm not even sure I know what "I love you" means now.
Look.
All I know is you and I belong together.
I mean, I've always been able to talk to you, to make you laugh, and I've always, always wanted to take care of you.
All right.
Topanga, I've been completely honest with you.
So I got my jean jacket so I'll leave you alone.
So that's what "I love you" means?
Yeah.
Bye.
Cory.
Uh-huh?
I love you too.
I was always hoping you did.
Christi, we should rethink this whole "I love you" thing.
'Cause it only leads to heartache.
Take my little brother, Cory.
- The adorable one?
- Yeah, him.
I mean, he goes off and tells his girlfriend he loves her.
What does it get him?
They don't even speak anymore.
I'm telling you, those words are death to any relationship.
So, let's just pretend it never happened, OK?
Hi.
Tell Mom and Dad I'm walking Topanga home.
And I'm taking the long route.
Pottery Barn?
I love you, Eric Matthews.
And I love you, Christi i Uh
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Mr. Williams, there you are.
Well, all right.
A gift for makin' it through my first week, huh?
Actually, these gift baskets are from misguided seniors - trying to get college recommendations.
- Uh-huh.
Kiwi and mango, Toblerone Beluga caviar?
Hey, man, thanks.
Don't get too attached.
You're taking them as far as my car.
Here.
It's good to be you, isn't it?
- I deliver these to homeless shelters.
- Mm.
Right.
Drop that mango, man!
Boy, what some kids will do to get into college, huh?
Yes, well, save your money.
They haven't built a fruit basket big enough to sway me.
Oh, I wouldn't think of it, Mr. Feeny.
It's the furthest thing from my mind.
Right there next to your school work, huh?
You stop that.
Mr. Matthews, where did you get that papaya?
From home.
Is there a problem?
I've got my eye on you.
- Hey, George, what's up?
- Well, I just wanted to be sure you knew that the Hunter boy missed his history test this morning.
- He what?
- Oh, that's my fault, my fault.
I was supposed to tell you that Shawn had a severe case of, uh Help me out here.
- Sloth?
- Yes.
Hong Kong sloth.
That's it.
Not your best work, Mr. Matthews.
Hunter!
- What are you doin'?
- You're just in time.
I'm ordering Forrest Gump on pay-per-view.
You miss another day of school, you are Forrest Gump.
Cool.
He's done all right for himself.
He doesn't exist!
Like you in school.
- You know, you missed a history test.
- That was today?
Boy, that worked out.
I give up, Hunter.
I got too much goin' on to keep tryin' to figure you out.
Tomorrow morning, you're seeing a guidance counselor.
Ooh, I don't think so, John.
My people are celebrating a very important holiday tomorrow.
- What people would that be?
- Well We're staying home tomorrow to come up with a name.
Hong Kong sloth?
Well, Feeny came up with the "sloth," but I added the "Hong Kong" part.
Turner didn't even wanna talk about it.
He's all, "Hunter, tomorrow you're seeing the new guidance counselor.
" I'll tell you one thing, though.
Shawn Hunter is not gonna waste an hour of his life listening to some baldheaded, long-winded, leisure-suit-wearing know-it-all.
Oh, my name's on the door!
They didn't have to do that!
- You're the new guidance counselor?
- Hi, I'm Devon Collins.
Hi.
Shawn Hunter.
Guide me.
Matthews.
You're lookin' like college material.
Yeah, here's your money.
Let's see it.
- Can I pat him down?
- Maybe later, Frankie.
OK.
I believe you'll find it flawless.
- Ah, Feeny stationery.
- White as snow.
Ready for any college recommendation you care to write yourself.
Now can I pat him down?
Frankie, I'm doin' business here.
Fine.
Hey, wait a minute.
How'd you guys get your hands on Feeny's stationery?
- Let's just say it fell off a truck.
- OK.
Oh, I'm going to need a Feeny envelope.
- Frankie.
- Tuesday.
- Tuesday.
- Tuesday.
Frankie, Frankie!
Listen Oh, Griff, our leader.
Yeah, everything's fine.
Why would you think otherwise?
Joey, whenever I see you, the phrase "small doses" comes to mind.
Frankie, major news.
There I was, surfing the Internet, you know, verbally pounding people, and I got this message from Harley.
- Harley Keiner?
- Yeah.
Or as he's known on the Net, "Harlkein.
" He's gettin' out, Frankie.
Our Harley, a reform-school graduate.
- I'm brimming with pride.
- Yeah, well, save it.
He's busting out in a shipment of laundry next week.
I see nothing but good here.
Our old leader Harley can meet our new leader Griff.
They can bond and become the best of Ah.
So, Shawn, tell me what your last guidance counselor said.
- This is my first time.
- Really?
Mine too.
- Oops.
I shouldn't have said that out loud.
- Your secret's safe with me.
Now, according to your file Wow Why don't I save you time?
Let's just skip to the part where you tell me education is the key to a happy and successful life.
- Is that what I'm supposed to say?
- It's what everyone else says.
Well, it's not that simple.
You know, in my house, growing up, all my parents ever talked about were the money, marriage and mortgage.
My dad always talks about the three B's: babes, bucks and brewskis.
- Your dad sounds colorful.
- He was the philosopher of the trailer park.
He used to say, "One man's septic tank is another man's oasis.
" - But I never knew what he meant.
- Could I take a shot?
I think he meant what's good for one person doesn't hold for everyone.
All right, Dad.
I always knew high school wasn't for everyone.
'Cause, you know, not everyone's gonna end up in college.
So, you're not planning on college, huh?
You saw my file.
"Wow"?
Shawn, I felt the same exact way.
I hated the idea of college.
In fact, I took a year off and traveled around Europe.
Even lived in Spain for six months.
I'll bet I know more about bullfighting than any woman you'll ever meet.
You don't know my Aunt Debbie.
The point is, I did end up in college.
But I needed to learn about myself first.
George, George, I need a favor.
Send me a gift basket, like everyone else.
- You're on your game today.
- What is it, Mr. Williams?
- Well, my TV production class?
- Mm-hm.
We're doing these kind of practice public-service announcements, and I could use your help.
Oh, I'm sorry.
But between teaching and administrative duties, I couldn't possibly find the time.
Really?
That's too bad.
The kids thought you'd have made the perfect narrator.
- Oh?
Did they really?
- Yeah.
But you know what?
If you're too busy Well, now, I wouldn't wanna disappoint the students.
Well, great.
Here you go.
Hmph.
Hmph!
You're not married to any of this, are you?
You sure this will work, Joey?
Yeah, I e-mailed the warden that Harley's bustin' out with next week's laundry.
They'll keep him locked up for the next ten years.
I'm tellin' ya, Frankie, it's foolproof.
Hello, boys.
- Let us review.
- No time to review.
Harley's here!
Standing in front of us a week early.
Of course.
You think I'd go online with my real escape plan and tip off my enemies?
Ah, me and my boys, together again.
Guys, come on.
It's just a stupid rumor.
I mean, there's a better chance of me running into the Loch Ness monster than ever seeing that greaseball Harley Keiner here again.
I mean, re And here I am in Scotland.
Baboon.
Did you get those threatening letters I sent?
Yes, I did.
Thank you.
Sorry I didn't answer.
I've been busy.
Here's my wallet.
Enjoy.
I still got it.
- I didn't hear nothin'.
- Beep, beep, beep?
Griff is paging us.
Griff?
Who's Griff?
Yeah, Frankie.
Who's Griff?
I mean, you got a new leader or somethin'?
Joey, Joey.
The first thing you both should do is be straight with me.
Now, tell me about this Griff.
He's just some leader that we met on the rebound, Harley.
Nothin' serious.
- Maybe if you just met the guy - Let's say we meet tomorrow.
Right here, 12 noon.
We can get to know each other.
Maybe I'll get a chance to find out his blood type.
And you were worried.
No, clown, no!
Cory.
Weird dream.
So, what's so important that you had to get me up at five in the morning?
I'm taking off, Cor.
I just wanted to say goodbye before I left.
OK, bye.
No, really.
I'm leaving town.
Shawn, I know what this is.
Today's Ms. Birnbaum's biology test, and seeing that you've never met Ms. Birnbaum, you're ditching.
This has nothing to do with school.
This is about me.
I'm doing a little traveling.
Getting to know myself.
I mean, I can't be happy in school until I'm happy with myself.
- Where'd you get an idea like that?
- From the guidance counselor.
So, Turner's just letting you take off?
He doesn't know, and I don't want him to find out.
He'd just try and stop me.
So, could you just do me a favor and cover for me long enough so I can get out of town?
- Shawn, this is stupid.
- Look, I've thought all this through.
I've never been more psyched, more ready for anything in my whole life.
You got a few bucks?
No!
OK.
Just asking.
Well see ya.
Wait, Shawn.
Shawn, stop.
This whole thing is crazy.
I mean, you don't even know what you're doing here.
- Cory, are you really my friend?
- You know I am.
Then you'll let me go.
"So, in conclusion, I find Eric Matthews to be really, really, really smart, really, really, really nice and really, really, really good for your school.
" "Really.
" "Yours truly, George Milhous Feeny.
" "Princi " Uh "Princip " Uh "Head guy.
" College, here I come.
Eric, you're up early.
What do you got there?
Ah, this is a, uh It's a paper I'm working on.
Well, why didn't you use the computer?
Well, it's a paper on the Amish, and somehow it just seemed wrong.
- Well, can I read it?
- Oh.
Dad, you know the Amish.
They're very private people.
Son, you're scaring me.
Typewriter?
Oh, no.
Eric, did you put a waffle in the computer again?
Mom, I was 15.
Let it die.
I can't believe he does this to me.
- Over and over and over again!
- Does what?
- I said I don't wanna talk about it.
- You did not say that.
Well, I don't wanna talk about it.
I definitely said it that time.
Sorry.
It's been a really rough morning.
I mean, first I had this scary dream.
- The clowns?
- Yeah.
Yeah, the same one.
And then Oh, who am I kidding?
I know what I've gotta do.
- What exactly are you doing, Cory?
- The right thing.
And it's all your fault.
You had to go and raise me right.
Oh, great.
Turner's machine.
Now I gotta listen to three minutes of Cat Stevens.
Oh, dolt.
Who am I kidding?
I'll just tell him in person.
You know, I'm gonna take a shot in the dark here, but something's bugging him.
Thanks, Waffle Boy.
Alan, did you see this letter that George wrote for Eric?
Uh, Mom, uh "Dear sir, if you only accept one student this year, make it Eric Matthews.
" "Hey, would I, George Feeny, be writing this letter on my personal stationery if I really, really really didn't believe that"?
I caught him in a really, really, really good mood.
Aw!
Eli!
I have to tell you, I had the most marvelous time yesterday recording my voice.
I can't wait to see how they put it all together.
- Well, it's just a student project, George.
- Oh, I still wanna have a copy.
- Here's the thing.
- What?
See, the kids They cut you out.
- What?
- Well, I fought for you.
I fought for you, but they decided to go in a different direction.
What direction would that be?
Me.
But don't worry.
There'll be plenty of other projects throughout the entire year.
- I'm sure something will come up.
- Keep your pity, man.
Mr. Turner, we gotta talk.
It's about Sean.
Wait, don't tell me.
Today he has African sloth.
Look, I'm not supposed to tell you, but I got to.
Shawn took off.
What are you talkin' about?
Where'd he go?
I don't know!
I mean, he had that meeting with the guidance counselor, and the next thing I know, he splits.
Matthews, thanks.
You did the right thing.
Yeah.
I'm cursed.
- You Devon Collins?
- Uh-huh.
- I sent Shawn Hunter to you yesterday.
- Oh, you're Jonathan Turner.
Yeah.
Look, he's run away.
Do you have any idea where he went?
- He ran away?
- Yeah.
Why don't you tell me what you guys talked about so I can make some sense of this?
Well, we talked about family and college and finding yourself.
- Uh-oh.
- What?
I did mention my year off in Europe.
You said that?
Come on, you're a guidance counselor.
What kind of guidance is that?
Back up.
I only spent a half an hour with him.
He's lived with you for four months.
Why do you think he ran away?
Ooh, that was good.
Griff and Harley fightin' - it just don't seem right.
Maybe they won't show.
You know, maybe they realized that fightin' ain't the way to solve anything.
Maybe they both had one of those moments where suddenly everything makes sense, you know?
- An epiphany?
- No.
Joseph, is it me, or do I suddenly sense an eerie calm?
A swinging locker, paper blowing by?
Frankie, that can't be good.
We gotta bail!
We gotta get outta here now!
We can't.
My mom won't pick us up till 3:30.
You and your stinkin' carpool!
Here I am.
Punctual, as is my way.
Yet I do not see the object of my despise.
So I guess you were sent up for bad grammar?
This is Griff?
- Where's the rest of him?
- So, Brando, I hear you wanna pound me.
"Pound" is such a wussy word.
I prefer No, "pound" works.
What are you waiting for?
See, the sooner you hit me, the sooner Feeny finds out the sooner you're back in the reform school.
But I'm sure a smart guy like you already figured that out.
He's a thinker, this one.
So, the fight's over.
Who's up for a little Chinese?
I'm a thinker too.
Boys, do him.
Uh, by "do him," you mean Frankie the Enforcer, not me, Joey, 'cause let's face it - you know, I'm the brain.
I'm waitin', Frankie.
All right.
I know what I gotta do.
I'm sorry about this, but Griff, I quit.
Harley, I quit.
I can't be a lackey no more.
Frankie, what are you saying?
I'm saying exactly what you should say.
It'll do a lot of good for you, Joey.
Come on.
From in here.
I don't wanna be a lackey no more, either.
I'm gonna be my own man.
There, I said it.
Now, that's what you call an epiphany.
And it was beautiful.
Well, Harley, I guess we have nothing to fight about anymore.
Pleasure meetin' ya.
And good luck with this whole retro thing.
I stand here bemused.
Frankie and Joey showing spine.
Self-esteem.
Dare I say, chutzpa.
Yeah, well, you know.
It's gonna be a real challenge beating it out of you.
And the beauty is I gave ol' Crisco-head Keiner a fake wallet.
I'd like to see his face when he finds out.
It'll look a lot like this but perturbed.
Hey, kid, want a mango?
- Sure.
Thanks, mister.
- Oh, don't thank me.
Thank George Feeny.
Hey, there's teeth in this basket.
Oh, wait.
They're mine.
Oh!
Hunter, you're still here.
- John, how'd you find me?
- Easy.
Once I found out where you were goin', I figured, "Shawn Hunter, Europe bus.
" I'm going.
Paris.
- Paris, Texas?
- Oh.
I thought the "TX" meant "tax.
" Look, I don't know what Miss Collins told you, but running away is not the answer.
John, I'm not running away.
I'm finally going someplace.
Doing something with my life.
You know, I could ski the Alps or even go to Spain and chase the bulls.
Uh, actually, they chase you.
Who needs Spain?
Europe's a big town.
I'm sure there's tons of cool stuff I can do.
This is a big step.
How come you didn't come and talk to me about it?
Well, you know, John, you're busy.
You got your own stuff goin' on.
That doesn't mean I don't care about what's happening in your life.
Yeah, I know you care about me.
I know that inside you're like my buddy and all.
Well, yeah, you're my buddy too.
You know?
But it's more than that, Shawn.
I'm responsible for you.
John, give yourself a break.
It's not like you're my dad.
- No, I guess I'm not.
- And I'm cool with that.
I mean, I'm used to being on my own, and it's it's made me realize that I gotta look out for myself.
So, see you later.
Thanks for the roof.
Shawn!
Get back here.
- You're not going anywhere.
- I'm going to Europe.
No, you're going to Texas.
Shawn, come on, you're 15 years old, you got no money, and you have no idea what you're getting yourself into.
- You think there's a chance that I'm right?
- I don't know.
You're coming home with me, where you belong.
OK?
Look, if you really wanna go to Europe we'll go together, next summer.
I could see that working.
But only if you start going to class and getting those grades up.
OK?
Come on, you got a history test to make up.
Hey, kid.
You listen to your dad.
Yeah.
I think I'm gonna.
All right!
I'm going to Europe!
If I don't tell Turner, Shawn runs away and I lose my best friend.
- Uh, Cory - If I do tell Turner, Shawn gets mad, and even if he does come back, I lose my best friend.
- I mean, either way, I lose.
- Cory Plus, Harley Keiner's back, and I'm running out of wallets.
- Excuse me.
- And I also have these circus dreams.
I don't know.
This is really not the type of counseling I do, but when you're ready to talk about colleges, come back Look what I found.
- Sean, you're back.
- A little older, a little wiser.
Shawn, do me a favor.
Next time we talk, before you leave, could you maybe let me know what you think I said?
Huh?
And if you still have any questions, you know, you can always talk to me.
Is that everything?
'Cause I'd like a little closure with my friend here.
- Look, Cory, I'm not angry at you - Oh, you're not angry?
Well, I'm not apologizing.
Now, I know I did the right thing.
I've been doing a lot of reading, and I can no longer be responsible for your actions.
I got it.
So, I guess I missed the biology test this morning, huh?
Don't worry.
I took it for ya.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Don't forget, lab reports by the end of the day.
No extensions, no exceptions.
Any sad stories, you can try.
I'm always up for a laugh.
- Did you do your paper?
- No.
You?
I didn't even know there was one.
- So what do we tell Sorrell?
- The truth.
- That aliens abducted us.
- And ate our papers.
Good.
We've got our stories straight.
No, no, no, no, Tommy.
When I said "no exceptions" I didn't mean you.
You rest that touchdown-throwing arm of yours.
Turn your paper in by the end of football season.
I play basketball, too.
Well, then, just forget about it.
- Hey, Dr. Sorrell - No.
You know what?
Why don't I handle this?
Because Dr. Sorrell and I have the kind of close-knit relationship that goes way beyond student-teacher.
I mean, we are very tight.
He didn't even know my name.
- What are you so upset about?
- Oh, I don't know.
Could it be staying up all night to finish my paper?
Could it be breaking into school so my paper's not late?
Or could it be losing half my pants on the barbed wire?
I don't know why you didn't just walk through the gate like I did.
It was too easy.
It looked like a trap.
Come on, let's look over here.
You know what bugs me the most?
Tommy the football hero gets a free ride for throwing a stupid lucky touchdown.
Cory, let me tell you something about breaking and entering.
You usually don't hang around and vent while you're doing it.
He's only fooling himself if he thinks this hero stuff's gonna carry him through life, though.
Oh, yeah.
Troy Aikman's really hurting.
I'm a felon, Hunter.
Don't push me.
All I'm saying is, he's heading for a fall if he believes his own hype.
Come on.
Let's just put our papers on the desk and get out of here.
We are home free.
- Uh-oh.
- Check the batteries.
OK, OK.
But I need a flashlight.
We need matches now.
All right, we're in a chem lab.
There's gotta be matches around here somewhere, right?
Ta-da!
Matches.
As some famous guy once said, "Let there be light.
" Ow, ow, ow, ow!
- Backdraft!
- Oh, my God!
- Was the fire out when you left?
- It's a trash-can fire.
It'll go out by itself.
Or tomorrow, when they take out the trash.
Shawn, Shawn.
It's a chemistry lab.
Chemicals explode.
- Oh, no, this is bad.
- That's what I'm saying.
No, no, no, no.
I ended my paper, "In conclusion, chemicals don't explode.
" - Hey, where you going?
- To save the school.
Hey, while you're in there, can you change the ending on my paper?
- Shawn, I'm still scared.
- Cory, relax.
We got away with it.
We pulled the alarm, the school didn't burn down, we got our papers in.
And the beauty?
Nobody knows.
Hey, you two.
I know.
- What do you know?
- I know what you did last night.
- You, Curly.
Come with me.
- Shawn?
Quick, rub off your DNA.
This is the guy.
After the fire alarm rang, I saw him running down the hall.
Mr Matthews, is this true?
Well, if he says he saw me, then I guess he saw me.
- All right, Matthews.
Attaboy.
- Attaboy?
You betcha.
I was asleep in my office.
Well, closet.
The alarm woke me up and saved my life.
If it wasn't for your courageous action, today some other janitor would be sweeping me up.
Sounds to me like the little feller's a hero.
Yeah.
It does sound that way, doesn't it, Cory?
Irony.
Well, how fortunate for us that you were passing by the school at that moment.
- Yeah, it was.
- What exactly were you doing out there?
Oh, I don't know.
Just one of those right places at the right time things.
And am I glad he was.
Anybody who saves my life is OK in my book.
You know, Shawn, I'm a little uncomfortable with the whole school thinking I'm a hero.
- You are a hero.
- I don't think so.
Well, whoever laid down this carpet for you sure thinks you are.
Yeah, how do you know they laid it for me?
It leads directly to your locker.
It does.
Ooh.
Plush.
Cory Matthews.
- You know me?
- Do I know you?
Who doesn't?
I graded your paper this morning.
A-plus.
But, sir, it's all burned.
The only thing left is my name and the date.
I saw where you were going.
Keep up the good work.
Oh, and, Hunter?
D. Chemicals do explode.
- I got an A, Shawn.
- Wow.
A D. - I'm riding your coattails.
- You know, this doesn't feel right.
Cory, this is exactly what you were talking about yesterday.
Your free ride.
Tommy got lucky with his touchdown and you got lucky with the fire.
- The one I started?
- Nobody knows that.
Come on, you're always saying how you want to be somebody.
Now you are.
- You're a hero.
- I hope you don't mind, but I took the liberty.
Go ahead.
Press it.
It's a Locker Genie.
You like it?
And here's an extra clicker for your wife.
- Shawn, do you see this?
- Yeah.
The perks of herodom.
You know, I could get used to this.
You deserve it, Cory.
You saved a man's life.
I did, didn't I?
Click.
And you know what?
I'm glad I did.
Nice guy, that Janitor Bud.
- He deserved to have me save his life.
- You're a hero, aren't you?
You see a burned-down school anywhere?
Hero.
Shawn, there you are.
We gotta meet Cory.
- Where?
- The rally in the caff?
Oh, right.
For the football teams?
No, I hate that stuff.
You know, jocks, guys with tubas.
Cheerleaders.
Come on.
A lot of people think I'm a big deal around here because I throw touchdown passes.
And I am.
But I wouldn't have a field to do it on if it wasn't for this guy.
So this Saturday, we're dedicating our big game to our inspiration, Cory Matthews.
So here to introduce the man of the hour is his brother Eric - What's your last name?
- It's Matthews.
- Wow, same as your brother's.
- It's weird, huh?
OK, I'd like to start off with a megabig Patriots hello to all my fellow students.
Specially you, Christine Wingate.
I see you looking at me.
Cory Matthews.
Cory Matthews, Cory Matthews.
Now, what can I say, except, well Last week Stephanie and I broke up, so I am currently single and available.
Call me.
Cory Matthews, a hero.
Cory, Cory, Cory.
Thank you, Eric.
Thank you, Tommy.
My fellow heroes.
I've been asked to tell my story, to give the football team a little shot in the arm.
Excuse me, I still have some smoke in my lungs.
Now, you guys are playing this weekend, and you're scared, because the other guys are bigger than you.
Well, last night, my friends, those flames were a lot bigger than me.
- All right!
- Yeah!
- But did I run away?
- No.
That's right, my friends.
Because if you're gonna succeed in business, or on the gridiron, you have got to believe you can do it.
Remember, there's a little Cory Matthews inside each and every one of you.
It's a metaphor.
Cory, Cory.
Isn't it great what's happening to Cory?
Everyone loves him.
Cory, Cory, Cory, Cory!
This was the greatest day of my life.
Do you think the student council can really do it, Shawn?
- What?
- Get the school named after me.
Cory Adams High.
Look, Cory, I'm glad you're having a free ride and all, but What, Shawn?
What?
Well, I just want to make sure you still have your feet on the ground.
You know, it sounds like you're trying to rain on my parade.
Which I believe is on Tuesday.
I'm just saying what you said.
You know, don't buy into your own hype.
Shawn, this is different, all right?
I'm just letting people think what they want to think.
It's not like I'm gonna walk in this door and lie to my parents.
Surprise!
- For me?
- Yes.
There's the man that saved the school.
- Eric told you?
- I didn't have to.
Hey, everybody told us.
That phone hasn't stopped ringing all day.
Well, then, why didn't you just answer it?
So, Cory, tell us everything.
Well, Mom, Dad, I don't know what you guys have exactly heard, but Here's what really happened.
I was walking back from Chubbie's when I saw the flames.
I didn't have time to think.
The next thing I know, I'm running into the building Shawn, you didn't stay for dinner last night.
Yeah, I wasn't hungry.
Look, I know you're mad at me, and I didn't want to lie to my parents, but I just figured that if I'd told them the truth it would have made things a lot worse, you know?
Sure you're not just getting off on this whole thing?
Shawn, I'm just giving people what they want.
- I mean, I don't want to disappoint them.
- Disappoint them?
Listen to my morning.
Listen to this.
Photo shoot with the homecoming queen.
Sushi with Dr. Sorrell.
Then I gotta fight traffic to greet the new exchange students at the airport.
- I don't know how to make it stop.
- You could just tell them no.
- Well, I'm afraid to do that.
- Why?
'Cause I don't want to go back to being the same old Cory Matthews.
What was wrong with him?
Shawn, I've been at this school for two years, and people still call me Eric's brother, Shawn's friend, or my favorite, "Hey, kid, move.
" Cory, aren't you afraid this whole hero thing's getting out of control?
Look, I lied to my school, I lied to my folks.
How much worse can it get, right?
Matthews.
How would you like to tell the rest of Philadelphia what a hero you are?
There's your answer.
Eli called some of his buddies, arranged for an appearance on Philadelphia Tonight.
They want me on TV?
Not just you, they want your whole family.
They'll be at your house tonight.
- Huh?
How great is that?
- Excuse me.
Famous people.
They're all weird.
Come on, Eli.
He's just nervous.
I mean, he can save a guy from a burning building, but he's scared of a little TV camera.
It's almost cute.
That's it, Shawn.
I've reached my limit.
I can't go through with this.
Can't go through with what, Mr. Matthews?
Cory's gonna be on TV.
What on earth for?
They just want him to tell the whole story about the fire.
Oh, wonderful.
I've also been waiting for him to tell the whole story.
Well, Mr. Feeny, I think you pretty much know everything.
Perhaps you're right.
- What did he mean by that?
- Oh, it's Feeny.
Three years and I still don't understand a word he says.
Hello, you're on the air with Dr. Sharon.
- Hi, Dr. Sharon.
First-time caller.
- And your name is?
Gomez.
And why are you calling this afternoon?
Well, I needed somebody to talk to.
Talk to me, Gomez.
Gomez?
Oh, right.
That's me.
Well, Dr. Sharon, I'm in kind of a bad situation.
See, uh, people think I'm something I'm not, and I want to come clean.
But Well, I'm afraid the truth is only gonna make things worse.
So what I'm hearing is, you're in need of a little courage?
Yes.
Yes, I am.
But where do I find that?
I suggest you look deep inside yourself.
I've been on hold for 45 minutes, that's the best you can do?
I have another suggestion.
This evening at 7:30, tune in to "Philadelphia Tonight.
" They're doing an inspirational story about a brave boy named Cory Matthews.
Ah, what the heck do you know, lady?
Well, there's no turning back now.
The news van has pulled up.
They're bringing in cameras, cables, lights.
- Ooh.
- What?
Bagels.
You know what, Shawn?
I'm glad you're here with me for this.
Where else would I be, Gomez?
I mean, I'm partly to blame.
I'm the one who told you to ride this whole thing.
So you're gonna go on TV with me?
And lie to the entire city?
What kind of idiot would do something like that?
Half hour to our debut, boys.
Our debut?
Eric, what are you talking about?
I'll tell you what I'm talking about.
Rich Herrera.
What?
Rich Herrera.
He's the weather guy on Philly Tonight.
He is such a lame-o.
But when the TV audience gets a load of me, Herrera's out, Matthews is in.
Bet you that's not in his five-day forecast, huh?
Everybody loves Rich Herrera.
Hey, he is nothing but a head of hair and a winning smile.
So.
How do I look?
Head of hair, winning smile.
Yes!
I am so the new weatherman.
Eric, what if this TV thing didn't happen tonight?
What are you saying?
Well, what if I told you that I'm not really a hero?
That I'm the one who started the fire, and this whole thing kinda snowballed.
You're protecting Herrera, aren't you?
Shawn, this is the low point of my life.
I mean, after this I am going straight to hell.
- And you know what the worst part is?
- What?
They'll expect me to put out the fire.
OK, guys.
This is how it's gonna work, OK?
In 30 seconds they're gonna throw it to us, OK?
And then I'm gonna pop you a couple question marks.
You know, we'll talk.
You know, "We love him, we love him, we love him.
" OK?
Now, don't hold back on me.
Tears if you got 'em.
OK?
We'll do a commercial, we'll march out the hero, he'll tell his story, flames, flames, flames, flames, flames.
We load up the van and we're drinking by nine.
Well, not the young ones, of course.
- Did you work for her?
- Before she mellowed.
Hello, Connie.
As seen on TV.
Oh, and who is this handsome young man?
Hi, I'm Eric Matthews.
The pleasure's all mine.
Have you been outside today?
With the wind chill factor it's like minus 17 degrees out there.
Brr!
Put on those parkas, Philadelphia.
Oh, yeah, OK.
OK, guys.
Three things to remember.
I want you to smile, have fun, and don't you dare talk over me.
In five, four, three, two That's right, Charlie.
We are indeed in the home of Cory Matthews, the courageous young man who saved his school.
- Psst.
- And, in the process, - Hey, you.
Here's what we do.
- pulled so-called Janitor Bud We switch shirts, you do the interview and I'll hold your sound stick.
It'll be a gas.
Uh, excuse me.
Are you part of this?
Uh, excuse me, yeah.
I helped Cory start the fire.
Later in the program, Cory himself.
But first, his family.
- You must be very proud.
- Oh, yes, we are.
Yeah, he's he's he's a great kid.
And how does it feel, knowing that you've raised such a great kid?
It Well, Connie, you know, it it it's funny.
You, uh, bring this little wrinkled thing home from the hospital, and you never expect that one day Uh, you know, Connie, if I may protrude?
Uh, yes.
Eric, the brother.
I like to look at Cory as a coastal eddy.
See, he comes home from school heading east, having gathered strength over the ocean Thank you.
I'm going to get right to the point here.
Has being a hero changed Cory?
Well, you know, Connie, I've also got some birthday wishes.
Gorgeous Edna Stein is a hundred years young today.
Happy birthday, Edna.
- Eric, go to your room.
- Uh, Dad, this is live TV.
- I don't care.
- Uh, back to you, Connie.
- Go.
- Ah, those kids.
- He's going.
- You know, you asked, um, if Cory has changed now that he's a hero, and, you know, I don't think so.
- I don't think so.
- That's what's so great about Cory.
He's still the same sweet, wonderful kid he always was.
Well, you have to understand, Connie, that Cory didn't do this to be a hero.
He did this because it it it had to be done.
I mean, for Cory, doing the right thing That's what makes him special.
And we'll be right back with Cory Matthews himself, after this weather update from our own Rich Herrera.
Hey.
You see these azaleas?
They thrive on sunshine and water.
Not coaxial cables.
And take your generator off my bramble bush.
Ah, Mr. Matthews.
The eyes of Philadelphia are upon you tonight.
- Mr. Feeny, I don't feel so good.
- Preshow jitters?
No, I'm just not comfortable going on TV and being this - Hero.
- Hero.
What is that, anyway?
Well, different things to different people, I suppose.
A firefighter can be a hero.
I knew a man who worked in a factory for 30 years at a job he hated.
It was the only way he could support his family.
- I felt that he was a hero.
- Sounds like one to me.
But, to me, a real hero is someone who does the right thing, when the right thing isn't the easy thing to do.
You know, Mr. Feeny, don't you?
You've known all along.
Mr. Matthews, I don't have enough facts to make trouble for anyone, if that's what you mean.
You have an interview to do.
- Cory.
Hey, what are you doing out here?
- They're ready for you.
- Mom, Dad, I don't want to do this.
- Don't want to do what?
Go on lying to you.
Boy, this is hard.
You know that fire I put out?
I also kind of started that fire.
Cory, what are you talking about?
Well, I broke into the chem lab one night to turn in a late paper.
I mean I'm no hero, I'm just bad with matches.
- You started that fire?
- It was an accident.
And you went on letting people assume you were a hero?
What were you thinking?
I was thinking I wanted to be somebody I wasn't.
And I know, I know that was a mistake.
But the bigger mistake was not telling you guys the truth.
Well, Cory, you've made a lot of mistakes here.
Well, I just kept on hoping it would go away, so that I wouldn't get in trouble.
Well, it didn't, and you are.
So now what?
Now we go inside and we tell Connie that you're not going on TV.
And by "we," I mean "you.
" - She's gonna freak on me.
- Well, she'll just have to get in line.
Mr. Matthews?
Well done.
Your story confirmed what I suspected all along.
So you did know.
No, no.
No.
I just knew the character of the young man.
The character?
Heroic.
Oh, by the way, I'll see you at school tomorrow.
- But tomorrow's Saturday.
- Yes, I know.
Bring old clothes.
You'll be painting.
Janitor Bud, how can you take away his Locker Genie?
- I mean, he still saved your life.
- OK.
I owe you my life.
But Feeny signs the checks.
Clicker.
Mrs. Fraud?
Well, so much for the perks.
Come on, Cory.
Would you rather go back to being a hero again?
Nah.
I'm happy just being plain old Cory.
I mean, look.
I got my best friend, I got my girlfriend Hey, kid.
Move.
And I got my old name back.
Hey, Dr. Sorrell.
I got practice tomorrow, and do you think Oh, sure, Tommy.
Miss the lab.
Take all the time you need.
Oh, Dr. Sorrell.
Hey.
Um, listen.
I'm glad I ran into you.
I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow, and here's a note from my mom.
Tell someone who cares.
It's good to be me.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Cory, Cory, Cory.
Do you remember that goldfish I used to have?
- The turtle?
- Yeah.
Well, I finally replaced him.
Here, boy.
- What do you think?
- I don't know.
I'd hate to have to flush him down the toilet.
- It's a pig.
- Do you know something?
It is a pig.
Aw.
- He's cute.
- Last night I was at my old trailer park, digging around the sludge where our house used to be, and I found this little guy gnawing on my uncle Sal's old peg leg.
Poor Uncle Sal.
How does he get around without it?
Who said anything about without it?
Sal was there, he just never noticed the pig.
Shawn, I see what's going on.
I'm spending way too much time with Topanga, and this is your oh-so-subtle way of showing me that I can be replaced by a common pig.
Come on, Cory.
As flattered as you are, this piglet is nothing to do with you.
Well, come on, Little Cory.
- Time for class.
- Shawn.
Hey, it's the first name that popped in my head.
Oh, he's so adorable.
What's your name, cute feller?
His name's Little Cory.
I can see that.
- Where'd you get him?
- I found him.
Well, we have to find a nice home for Little Cory.
He has one.
With me.
No, I mean a proper home, where he can run around.
He can run around with me.
Come on, Shawn.
Do you really know how to raise a pig?
Topanga, it sounds like you're trying to tell me what to do.
- Well, it sounds like someone should.
- Guys, guys, lighten up.
I mean, any way you slice it, it's only a pig, right?
What?
You know, Cory, having a pig is sure making school fun.
- But the fun is over.
Look who's coming.
- Uh-oh.
Feeny.
- You taught him that?
- No.
He just knows.
- Hello, Principal Feeny.
- No farm animals here.
Yes, well.
The day is young.
Mr. Feeny.
Imagine finding you here.
I work here.
What can I do for you, Mr. Matthews?
You know, I've been thinking about school, reading up on colleges, trying to pick the right one for me.
Hm?
"Girls of the Ivy League.
" - Goodbye, Mr. Matthews.
- Uh, no, wait, Mr. Feeny.
Mr. Feeny.
Have you heard of a college called Ya-le?
- You mean Yale?
- Yeah.
Is that one any good?
It's one of the finest universities in the country.
Eric.
Hear my words.
It's no party school.
Oh, well, excuse me, Mr. Feeny, but according to this here girl floating on the raft reading the physics book, Yale rocks.
Eric.
Yale has perhaps the highest admission standards in the country.
Drat.
Now, have you thought of applying to someplace more accessible?
Maybe a state school?
Maybe a preschool?
All right.
Look, Mr. Feeny.
I have a question that I'm gonna need a yes-or-no answer to.
How many people get into Yale every year?
No.
Well, you gotta know somebody there.
Well, yes, I do.
But believe me, Mr. Matthews, it would take more than your grades to get you into Yale.
Oh, I'm hearing what you're saying, Mr. Feeny, and I'm winking right back at you.
Please don't.
Oh, Catherine.
Oh, Catherine, you wild woman.
Oh.
Oh, Catherine Hunter, we had an agreement.
He can't kiss me any more.
Look, Hunter, we went over the ground rules.
You can keep the pig Little Cory.
Little Cory.
But he's all yours.
I don't want to raise him.
I don't want to hear from him.
- Do we understand each other?
- Yeah.
Pig-hater.
I heard that.
Is there a thirsty pig here?
Come on.
Yes.
Hey, Shawn.
How's Little Cory doing?
- Better now.
- Well, I brought him a present.
That's nice, but it's not his birthday till Ah, heck, it's his birthday today.
A squirrel bank?
What?
They didn't have any piggy banks?
Well, I didn't think something where you shove metal into a pig's back would be that appealing to him.
Smart.
Hey, listen.
I think I'll be able to hook up with you and Topanga at Chubby's later.
Cool?
What?
You're gonna leave Little Cory alone?
You think that's a good idea?
Oh, yeah.
It's all here in What to Expect When You're Raising a Pig.
"When to Tell Your Pig About Bacon.
" Cory, Cory.
Little ears.
Listen, about tonight, hanging out with us at Chubby's.
Topanga's still a little upset about you keeping a pig in the apartment.
Little Cory.
Would you excuse us for a minute?
Cory, this is none of Topanga's business.
You're right.
You know, you're absolutely right.
And I told her that.
Good.
Thanks.
Then I told her you'd probably find a good home for it in a couple of days, right?
Wait, Cory.
Why would you do that?
Come on, Shawn, face it.
I mean, who keeps a pig in an apartment?
I do.
And you seemed to be OK with it this morning before you talked to your girlfriend.
Gimme a break, all right?
I'm not here to take anyone's side.
- Sure doesn't sound like it.
- Hey, I love the little sow.
Didn't his uncle Cory show up with a gift?
I don't know why Topanga has a problem with this.
I mean, nobody else does.
Hunter, I got a problem with your pig.
Left me a little gift on my pillow.
Was there a card?
Mr. Feeny.
Imagine finding you here.
I live here.
You stop that.
Anyway, you know, I was thinking about what you said, about how you had friends at Yale, and I was wondering what it would take for a man like George Feeny to Oh, look what Eric dropped.
Aren't you gonna pick that up?
Why?
Eric dropped it.
Here you are, Mr. Feeny.
A gift.
Two box seats to tomorrow night's opera?
- Is this a bribe?
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
This isn't a bribe.
This is, uh This is me doing something nice for you, hoping that someday you'll do something nice for me.
Yale.
Yale.
Mr. Matthews, I will do something nice for you.
Places like Yale embrace young people with culture.
- I like what I'm hearing, Mr. Feeny.
- Good.
Then I'll pick you up at 7:30.
Feeny say what?
Feeny say 7:30.
So I walk in and Chubby says, "Hey, who's the pig you're with"?
The pig points to me.
Cory, I thought you were going to talk to Shawn about keeping the pig.
Uh, I did.
Maybe it's another pig.
You know, I hear they travel in groups.
OK, if you're ordering.
Two number threes and two sodas.
Make his a diet.
Look, Shawn.
I'm not trying to be mean.
I just don't think it's fair for him to be living in an apartment.
He's a farm animal.
Yeah, well, according to my new book, Farm Animals Make Great Pets, farm animals make great pets.
You love him now, but what happens when he's 500 pounds, sitting on a couch, not moving?
Hey, I never stopped loving Aunt Gloria.
I'm not the only one who feels this way.
Right, Cory?
You look great, Topanga.
Did I mention that?
Hey, Cory, would you tell Topanga to back off?
Shawn, you don't look so bad yourself.
Cory, you didn't answer me.
Am I right or wrong?
- You're both right.
- We can't both be right.
- You can't?
- No.
Now, whose side are you on, Cory?
Well Yours, I guess.
Then let's grab a bite somewhere else.
Shawn, I You know, I Hey, you'd better go.
You don't want to keep your girlfriend waiting.
We gotta talk, Shawn.
I know you're there.
Come on, pick up.
Cory, what's going on?
Look, last night at Chubby's Shawn was out with this pig.
Hey, hey.
Hey.
I brought you up better than to talk like that.
A real pig.
And he really loves it.
But Topanga doesn't think he should keep a pig in the apartment and I kinda took her side.
Oh, well.
Um, did you think she was right?
Yeah, but, you know, he's right too.
- But you sided with Topanga.
- Yeah.
Well, of course he did.
He's a guy.
What else is he gonna do?
He could have told Topanga how he felt.
- No, she would have been mad at me.
- Well, now Shawn's mad.
Seriously, Cory, if you thought they both were right, you shouldn't have taken sides.
Well, it sounds easy.
Why was it so hard?
Well, being caught between your best friend and your girlfriend is tough.
You're growing up.
It's not always easy in the real world.
I'm going to Yale, I'm going to Yale It's a little easier in his world.
Hey, you gonna finish that?
Just asking.
- Shawn, we gotta talk.
- Excuse me.
I believe I'm with someone.
Yeah, of course you are.
Hey, there.
How you doing?
Enjoying our little school?
Meet any other pigs?
We don't get it.
Look, Shawn.
This whole thing, I know it's kind of my fault, and I'm sorry for taking Topanga's side last night.
But what's more important is we shouldn't let a little thing like this get in the way of our friendship, right?
- I mean, it's only a pig.
- Yeah, it's only a pig to you, Topanga, and whoever abandoned him at the trailer park.
- How do you know he was abandoned?
- That trailer-park manager told me.
His owners just drove off and left him.
He's all alone, man.
No home, no family, nothing.
- Poor guy.
- Yeah, I know what he's going through.
I've been there.
Don't you see?
Yeah, I think I do.
I'm not mad at you.
You took your girlfriend's side.
I'd have probably done the same thing.
Pigs and women, man.
Yeah.
Like my dad always said, they'll both break your heart.
Come on, Shawn.
I mean, this is killing me.
My best friend and my girlfriend not speaking, it's just not right.
Hey, it's her problem.
The way I see it, I'm just trying to live my life like any normal teenager.
Could you pass the pig shampoo?
Look, I, uh - I invited Topanga over.
- Why would you do that?
So she can see how much the pig means to you, and see what a great home this is.
- No.
Forget it.
- Come on.
I'm your friend.
- Yeah, well, Topanga's not.
- Just do it for me, then.
Please?
OK.
For you.
But one dig at me or Little Cory and she's gone.
Fine.
Hi, Cory.
Shawn, the light bulb was out in the hallway.
- You may want to tell the superintendent.
- That's it.
Out.
Shawn, Shawn, clearly no dig there.
I'm a little oversensitive.
So.
Cory says you're going to tell me why this is such a good home for the pig.
Topanga, I don't think I have anything to prove Shawn.
If I may.
Please.
Topanga.
Shawn is one heck of a parent.
As a matter of fact, just before you got here, he was bathing Little Cory in that - Tub.
Where is he?
- Oh, no, he's gone.
I left him in there so long he turned into broth.
- Well, there's your answer.
He walked out.
- Topanga, you left the door open.
Well, that's the kind of thing that happens when a pig lives in the city.
I'm going out to look for him.
All right.
I'll stay by the phone in case he calls.
Just go.
Oh, Little Cory.
Why would you run away?
Hunter, I found him outside, heading toward the Rib Shack.
Suicide.
You know, this pig has been nothing but trouble.
- Now I know I did the right thing.
- What thing?
I called Animal Control.
Told them there was a pig that needed a good home.
You did what?
Topanga, he has a good home.
Little Cory, let's get you out of here.
You coming with us?
Cory?
- Let's go.
- Cory?
Look, Topanga.
You put me in the middle of something, and I I I just gotta say, as much as I love you, that just That wasn't right.
And now to call the Animal Control.
I can't believe you would do that.
Come on, Shawn.
We got some serious pig-hiding to do.
You OK?
Mr. Turner, I know you don't like the pig.
So why do you let Shawn keep it?
I don't know.
Just seems real important to him, I guess.
He takes good care of the little guy.
Topanga, when you've had the kind of life Shawn's had, I guess, just in some ways Shawn needs the pig more than the pig needs Shawn.
Mr. Turner?
I think I made a big mistake.
Heads.
I trust that's your last one.
Mr. Feeny, I'm dying.
We've been here for, like, two hours.
It's been ten minutes.
Settle down and enjoy the evening.
What is there to enjoy?
We got three fat tenors going at it in Italian.
I'm fatter than you are I'm fatter than you are Shh!
Mr. Matthews.
Hush.
Mr. Feeny, I appreciate you helping me get into Yale and everything Oh, Mr. Matthews, I couldn't get you into Yale.
I couldn't get you into a Yale sweatshirt.
Oh, well, excuse me, Mr. "I'll just take the tickets and not complete the other half of the deal.
" The only deal I've ever made with you is to be your teacher and friend.
And with that, the responsibility to help make you a better person.
Mr. Feeny, I don't want to be a better person.
I just want to party with the girl on the raft.
Yes, well, you won't be doing that at Yale.
Guess I came here for nothing.
Mr. Matthews, say you did meet that young woman on the raft.
Or another woman just like her.
And say that she had a passion for culture.
Perhaps opera.
Well, now, don't you see that after this evening you now have something to talk about?
All right, Mr. Feeny, look.
It's a nice try, it's a nice plan, but don't you see?
This kind of stuff is lost on a guy like me.
Wait, I know this.
I know this.
Bom-ba-da-bom bom, bom-ba-da-bom bom This is Bugs Bunny!
It's Wagner.
No, no, we're talking cartoons here, Mr. Feeny.
You're way out of your league.
We're home free now, Shawn.
I don't know, Cory.
Hiding the pig at your house, isn't that a little obvious?
No, hiding the pig at Old MacDonald's house, that would be obvious.
And besides, if I know Topanga, I'll bet she didn't even call the Animal Control people.
Animal Control.
I am just a big fat stupidhead.
Sir.
My name's Victor Lasalle.
By law, I'm required to show you my badge.
Wait a minute.
That's your driver's license.
I'm Animal Control.
They don't give us badges.
All right.
So You must be Shawn Hunter.
Yeah, how'd you know?
Brown hair, five five.
Answers to the name "Shawn Hunter.
" He's good.
All right, OK.
Let's save ourselves a lot of time, a lot of unpleasantries.
You got a pig, I want him.
This pig you speak of.
Could you describe him?
Yeah, all right, OK.
Let's see.
He looks like a great big lion.
Oh.
- That's not our pig.
- No.
Cause, uh, cause we don't have one.
So, Mr. Animal Control man, kindly vacate my home at once.
Or else I will be forced to call the Animal-Control control people.
Yes, sir.
- Isn't that right, my dear Shawn?
- It sure is, my little Cory.
OK.
Who shaved the dog?
Control?
We got pig.
Good, good.
You have pig.
You must be real proud.
You know, son, I'm not in this business to break hearts.
The problem is, this neighborhood is not zoned for pigs.
But hey, you look like a nice enough kid.
Tell you what.
Keep it on the q. t., I got a 20-foot boa in my truck I could slip you.
Is it OK if I just say goodbye to Little Cory?
Yeah, all right.
Sure.
Why not?
But don't try to run.
I got a guy out by the back door.
Do you really?
I don't know.
Do you feel lucky?
Hey, it's not goodbye.
I'm gonna find out where you end up and I'm gonna come visit you.
'Cause I know what it's like to be passed around from home to home.
Here's looking at you, pig.
You can't take this pig.
Topanga Lawrence?
Been going out with Cory Matthews for two months?
I'm way overqualified for this job.
After I spoke to you, I saw this ad in the paper for a lost pig.
So I called its owners.
Now you don't have to take him away.
- Isn't that great, Shawn?
- Why is it great?
Yeah, I still lose Little Cory.
Doesn't matter who the owner is.
It's not me.
Here's the owner.
Hi.
Name's Turner.
I got a place outside the city, and this little guy ran off.
Belongs to my boy, Zed.
Zed?
- Is this really your pig?
- No, no.
My ark is outside, and I'm one pig short.
All right, that's it.
Hands over your head, we're going downtown.
You kidding me?
Yes, I am.
You know, two can play this sarcasm game.
All right, here's your pig.
Give my best to Zed.
You know, that offer for the 20-foot boa?
It's still good.
I'll think about it.
You got a card?
Yeah, right.
I don't even have a badge.
Hunter, I must really like you.
Thanks, man.
Topanga, you thought we couldn't give Little Cory a good home.
Why'd you change your mind?
A couple of things.
First, it's not my pig.
It's yours.
There's a start.
And then I've known you as long as I've known Cory.
So you're not just my boyfriend's friend.
You're my friend too.
You know, I think the pig's tearing up.
More!
More!
Whoo!
All right, Mr. Matthews.
The show's over.
Let's go.
That's their eighth curtain call.
Oh, more!
More!
Oh, Mr. Feeny, you opened up this whole new world for me.
The women are gonna be so impressed with my knowledge of culture.
Fortissimo!
Who knew?
Yes, well, you did very well for your first time.
Now can we go?
I'm tired.
Yeah, and a bit cranky.
Hey, Mr. Feeny, what happens if I meet a girl who doesn't like opera?
What if she likes ballet?
Can we go see that?
- Yes, yes.
- OK.
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Can we go see the philharmonic?
Yes.
May we go now?
I'm sorry, I just can't leave until something really big happens.
Nothing big happens.
It just ends.
Hey, wait.
Who's that fat lady?
OK, we can go now.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Next, we meet our own cafeteria lady.
The ever-cheerful Bertha Von Bulow.
Bertha, of course, the former nanny to the Gorbachev family, now prepares delectable Russian treats here at John Adams High.
Her specialty?
Red Square Jell-O.
Hey, girls.
Want to be in pictures?
Shawn, we're slicing Jell-O here.
Mm-mm.
Freedom never tasted so good.
Hunter.
Matthews.
Wake up.
We gotta watch your report, you gotta watch it.
But it stinks.
Maybe Mr. Williams doesn't know it stinks.
Oh, he knows.
Well, I for one think the students have a right to know how their food is prepared.
Cory did an excellent report.
- You two are an item, right?
- Uh-huh.
Matthews, you got yourself a good woman.
But the assignment was to find me a news story.
Now, how is Jell-O news?
When it's used for evil.
People, in my years as a news producer I learned two things, right?
You gotta tell the truth, and make it interesting.
You gotta find a grabber.
Now, you two keep that in mind as you redo your assignment.
Redo?
Oh, come on, Mr. Williams.
Everybody knows media arts is supposed to be an easy A. - Maybe he doesn't know that.
- Oh, he knows.
People, we go on the air in four days.
There's no reason why we can't have a great broadcast.
Mr. Williams, it's just public access.
I mean, we're on after the origami lady.
Actually, she's amazing.
She can fold up her body and make herself into a ship.
Ain't nothing wrong with that.
- Cory, come on.
You're late.
- For what?
- Put the camera over here.
- What's going on?
It's perfect.
Exactly what Mr. Williams asked for.
Across the street.
Third floor, second window on the right.
Well, what is it?
A robbery?
A sniper?
A hostage situation?
What?
- It's better.
- Shawn, unless there's something like I don't know, a woman dancing in a towel, I don't see how Shawn, there's a woman dancing in a towel.
She does this every day at 5:30.
I mean, you could set your watch by her.
Why would you do that?
Cory, it's just an expression.
Yeah, but why wouldn't you just call that number that gives the time?
I mean, sure, it's 35 cents, but it's based on the atomic clock Cory, there's a woman dancing in a towel.
You bet there is, baby.
Guys, get away from the window.
A camera?
What are you doing?
Homework.
- We're shooting a news report.
- For Mr. Williams' class.
Oh, and you're calling this news?
We think she's up to no good.
Guys, put the camera down.
Why?
Because I would like to think that you'd have the maturity and the restraint to not - Oh, boy, the towel fell down.
- Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh, my God!
Guys, guys!
Knock it off.
Exploiting someone's body is not news.
Come on, sit down.
Sit down.
We'll watch the 5:30 report, you'll see what real journalism is all about.
Up next, a very special report.
Breast enlargements.
Is bigger better?
Leonard, don't hold back.
A nervous stomach ain't nothing to be ashamed of.
Janitor Bud.
You must never embarrass a student like that.
Are you kidding?
Me and Leonard?
We're tight.
Hey, kid!
I still enjoy the chase.
All right, George.
What gives with all the beautiful women outside your office?
Oh, the secretarial prospects?
Yes, I'm interviewing today.
What happened to Mrs. Woolly?
She's moving to Florida to be closer to her grandchildren.
The little one, Monty, turns 50 this month.
So have we decided on a going-away gift yet?
Well, a couple of us chipped in and bought her an oxygen tank.
- Come on, George.
That's not even funny.
- Oh, stop it, man.
The woman's a certified scuba diver.
There's gotta be another story out there, Shawn.
Like what?
We've tried Jell-O, we tried dancing women.
- There's nothing else out there.
- There's lots of stuff.
Crime.
Scandal.
Hey, you know, we could do a story on my uncle Vic.
The one that was set up?
- Nah, it wouldn't work.
- Why?
There's a pretty good chance he'd kill us.
All right, then.
All right, we'll find a scandal of our own.
Where?
Here at John Adams?
There's no scandal here.
Tires.
Tires?
Stolen tires?
We follow Joey, we find a story.
You don't need tires, how about some tube socks?
Huh, guys?
Everybody needs tube socks.
- Oh, it's true.
It's true.
- What's true?
I heard there's some science lady looking for students to be part of a research study?
That's right.
I'm doing my thesis on psychoneurology.
So you're interested in the field of dream research?
Heck, no.
But I loved your flier.
"Earn cash while you sleep.
" Hi.
Eric Matthews, amateur sleeper, ready to turn pro.
Monique Larson.
Why don't you come in and I'll explain what we're doing?
Uh, what's to know?
Eyes shut, get cash, buy records.
So, this is my little makeshift laboratory.
And this machine will measure and record your brainwave and rapid eye movements while you sleep.
I got a job.
OK, settle down, people.
We're on the air live in 55 seconds.
This is so exciting.
- Topanga, how's my anchor doing?
- Katie Couric.
Katie Couric.
Katie Couric.
Oh, you go, girl.
- Hey, Topanga.
Are you sweating?
- I don't sweat.
I glisten.
- Yeah.
Well, you're glistening like a pig.
- Thanks.
OK, 30 seconds.
The origami lady's finishing up.
Unbelievable.
She looks just like the Queen Mary.
Right down to the deckchairs.
Ain't nothing wrong with that.
Well, Mr. Williams.
Your project has really come together.
- What can I look forward to?
- Oh, a lot of good stuff, George.
A little news, a little sports.
A profile on Janitor Bud.
Our Janitor Bud?
- He's not doing his magic tricks, is he?
- Well, I'm not sure.
You know, Matthews is in editing, finishing up the piece right now.
You're airing student reports you haven't seen?
George, these are good kids.
They haven't let me down yet.
Mr. Williams, this is high school.
Join us.
They're putting her in the water.
She's sailing away.
It's showtime.
- In five, four - Mr. Williams, Mr. Williams, I can't do this.
- three, two - You don't understand, there's no way Hello, Philadelphia.
This is Topanga Lawrence with the John Adams report.
campus police baffled by stolen tube-sock ring.
Thank you, Bob.
And once again, Bob's book, Confessions of a Crossing Guard is available in the school store.
And we'll be right back.
Topanga is doing very well.
She has a natural poise.
Leonard, a thought on the cue cards.
They're facing you!
And Hunter, where's Cory with the last story?
Mr. Williams, I can't work like this.
Everybody out of my way, I'm making TV.
OK, we're back.
In three, two And finally, a report filed by Cory Matthews on Janitor Bud?
Why?
It's out.
- Spinach.
- Cory, I'm rolling.
All right.
Remind me to edit this out, huh?
We're here in the hallways of John Adams High, where all of us are trapped.
Trapped like deer.
Deer?
Trapped deer.
All of us.
Until 3:30.
Or are some less trapped than others?
Right.
Bom bom bomm!
I'd be laughing too if I were skipping out at 2:55.
End of story?
No.
We know that Janitor Bud leaves at 2:55, yet he gets paid until 5 o'clock.
Scandal?
Oh, yeah.
Bom bom bomm!
Mr. Lincoln, meet Mr. Pocket.
And there you have it.
Janitor Bud, the man who's mopped his way into our hearts, willing to risk his spotless reputation for a few measly hours a week.
Where are our heroes?
I do not know.
But I do know this is the loneliest mop I've ever seen.
Wow.
Well This is Topanga Lawrence, and good day, and, uh Don't eat veal.
And we're clear.
Huh?
Huh, Mr. Williams?
Just what you asked for.
- News that grabs.
- Very effective report.
Well, it was tough at first, but once we found our angle we had a great time.
- Sure did some digging.
- So, Mom, Dad, how proud are you?
Your son, the investigative reporter.
Uh, Alan?
Um, well Cory, was this all true?
Well, you saw it.
"Not a dramatization.
Not a dramatization.
" - Well, that's very unfortunate.
- Why's that?
Because now I have the unpleasant task of firing Janitor Bud.
Maureen, hi.
I don't get it.
We finally do well in a class project, and people start acting all weird on us.
I mean, what's the big deal?
The big deal is nobody wants Janitor Bud fired.
Oh, he's not gonna get fired.
He's been in Feeny's office for over an hour.
Look, say what you want about Feeny.
- OK.
I think he's one of the biggest - Not now.
I'm telling you, Feeny's a fair man.
Trust me.
He'll give Janitor Bud a second chance.
- What?
No second chance?
- I wish there were some other way.
Oh, come on.
There's history between us, Georgie.
You and me, we're like brothers.
No, we're not.
Bud, you were caught on tape.
But in two months I retire.
Full pension.
I'm sorry.
OK.
I didn't want to use this, Feeny.
- But what about that time I saved your life?
- Saved my life?
You were walking down the hall when I noticed a patch of waxy buildup on the floor.
You were maybe two, three steps away.
There was no time to clean.
I had no choice but to throw myself onto the wax.
I thought you were napping.
Well, once I was down there Bud, I want to thank you for your devoted service.
Oh, come on, George.
Ammonia's in my blood.
No, really.
It is.
Oh, Bud, don't do this to yourself.
But it's all I know.
Godspeed, Bud.
I can't believe Bud was fired because of our report.
No, Shawn.
We have nothing to feel bad about, OK?
We told the truth.
If anyone should feel bad, Bud should.
I mean, he was the one goofing off.
Goofing off, huh?
You trying to tell me that leaving early for no apparent reason is goofing off?
Yeah.
Maybe you didn't get the whole story, Mr. "Didn't get the whole story.
" Did you bother to find out where our saintly Janitor B was going every day at 2:55?
- No.
- Uh-oh.
So before you go pontificating from your tokus, let me set you straight.
Every day, that sweet Bud of a man takes a few dollars that he has left, and he visits a place where there are others even less fortunate than him.
- Oh.
Oh, my stomach is bubbling.
- Good.
Your stomach should bubble.
Because that lovely man that you got canned, he's a giver.
And do you know where he gives, Matthews?
Oh, I don't want to know.
The track, Matthews.
Playing the ponies.
The joy of gambling was all he had left.
So next time you go sticking your nose someplace where it don't belong, you remember this.
You suck.
Wow.
Poor Bud.
Poor Bud?
"Saint Bud" skips work so he can bless the ponies.
Yeah, but now he's got no income what's he gonna gamble with?
Oh, he'll land on his feet.
I mean, he's a capable, talented janitor.
- Yeah, I guess you're right.
- Of course I am.
It's just weird to think that Bud's been through those doors for the last time.
And one more thing.
I know it was you two.
I put the janitor's curse upon you.
Eric?
Eric, wake up.
Gimme five more minutes, Mommy.
- Eric.
- Yeah?
Oh.
Oh, Monique.
Where's my money?
You didn't pay me while I was asleep, did you?
Eric, I have to ask you a few questions.
Questions?
Hey, wait, whoa.
That wasn't part of the deal.
Is this some kind of scam, Miss Staff?
You'll get paid.
I just have to know, do you remember any of your dreams?
Mmm No.
Do you remember any of your dreams from the past few months?
Years, even?
How am I supposed to remember 'em?
I was asleep.
- It's the oddest thing.
- What is?
Well, while you were asleep, you had this serene look on your face.
Almost goofy.
Thank you.
But you registered absolutely no brain activity.
- It's remarkable.
- Well, I've been sleeping since I was five.
If you don't mind, I'd love to run additional tests on you.
Whoa, whoa, hold on there.
Not so fast.
You want Mr. Remarkable, it's gonna cost you.
- What you're paying me today?
- Mm-hm?
I want half.
And then double it.
- You got it.
- All right.
Boy.
Even Bertha hates us over this whole janitor thing.
Well, I'd say the word "hate" is a little strong.
Read your bun.
"I hate you.
" Shawn, I'm a reporter, OK?
And it's my job to get the story, no matter what the consequences.
You OK?
- Janitor's curse, man.
- Shawn, don't let it get to you, OK?
There's no such thing.
All right?
Now, let's just relax, sit down, and enjoy our lunch.
Hey there.
Mind if we sit here?
Ah.
Taken.
Boy.
That's the last table.
Let's get out of here.
No.
No, I'm not gonna be intimidated.
It's gonna take someone a lot bigger than that to push Cory Matthews around.
Shawn, I think we have a winner.
Come on, let's go.
Man, Matthews is really taking a beating.
Yeah, but he had it coming, don't you think?
I mean, the kid's story cost Janitor Bud his job.
Yeah, but the whole school's on the little guy's case now.
- That was the assignment, wasn't it?
- Uh, yeah.
Told him to go out and get a hot news story, right?
Matthews did.
- That's the news business.
- Yeah, but this isn't the news business.
This is school.
These are kids.
Exactly.
And when I was doing it, it seemed so right.
Part of me still thinks it was, but everyone at school's treating me like a jerk.
What do you guys think?
Was I right or wrong?
- Well, I think it's obvious.
You were right.
- You were wrong.
Amy, darling, what do you mean?
I mean, Bud was caught red-handed skipping off to the track.
Oh, Alan, the poor old man was two months away from his pension.
He was a trifecta away from Tahiti.
Honey, the school was his life.
Yeah, until 2:55.
Is it just me, or am I getting mixed signals from you guys?
- Uh, Cory, this isn't about you.
- Alan, you're being a - Mom, Dad, I got great news.
- What?
What?
A letter from the University of Pennsylvania.
- You were accepted?
- Better.
They want to study me.
Yeah!
Cory, everybody's giving you such a hard time.
I hope they stop.
Topanga, come on.
I mean, people have short memories.
I mean Oh, like this has never happened to you.
I'll see you later.
Man.
That's a big old fish.
- You think?
- Listen, Matthews.
I want to talk to you.
- Yeah, well, you're the only one.
- Let's take a walk.
And leave the fish.
- So how's life?
- I don't know.
Big fish in my locker.
You tell me.
You don't deserve all this grief you're getting over this Janitor Bud thing.
I know.
I was just a reporter, doing my job.
Right?
You don't have a job.
You're a kid in school.
That's where I messed up.
You see, I'm supposed to teach you about the news business, and not put you in it.
Wait, wait.
Now I'm really confused.
Was I right or wrong?
Well, what do you think about your report?
I was proud of it.
I had a great time doing it.
Yeah.
And how do you feel about what happened to Bud?
Well, I feel bad for him.
I mean, I didn't mean for him to lose his job.
Welcome to the news business.
It's a tough game when you care.
So I was wrong when I did my story?
- No, I didn't say that.
- So I was right?
No, I didn't say that either.
There isn't always a clear right or wrong.
But I'm a kid.
I want it both ways.
Got a secret for you.
We adults do too.
When you get a chance, I'd like another cup of coffee.
Hello?
Hello?
- George.
Got a minute?
- Mr. Williams.
Oh, and Mr. Matthews.
It's a party.
You let me handle this.
Now, regarding this Janitor Bud situation.
Well, far be it from me to imply that you've said or done anything that's at all inappropriate Oh, just give the old gambler his job back.
Smooth, Matthews.
Gentlemen, save your breath.
The matter's closed.
Look, man, this is my fault.
I should have screened the tapes before I put them on the air.
But they did go on the air to the entire school board.
I had no choice.
I did what I had to do.
Come on, man.
Two more months with the school, he can retire with a full pension.
Mr. Feeny, how can you do this to a man who saved your life?
Oh, for the love of God, I saw that wax.
You know, Mr. Feeny, I always thought that deep down you had a heart of gold.
But, I mean, now I see the truth.
I see that Here's your stinking coffee.
that Janitor Bud's your secretary.
And by the way, Feeny, go easy on that buzzer.
It ain't a toy, you know.
Two months, huh?
Coasters, Feeny.
Coasters.
Blast my heart of gold.
Ladies, gentlemen, I'd like to thank you for flying in from all over the world.
As you can see, today's results are consistent with my previous research.
Fast asleep, and no brain activity whatsoever.
I know what you're thinking, Professor.
No, he's not dead.
Eric.
Eric.
What's up, Docs?
Ah.
So, Monique, how'd I do this time?
Wait, let me guess.
Remarkable.
Eric, you truly are the most content individual, without a care or worry in the world.
You are one of a kind.
Excellent.
So how'd the little mouse do?
This common field mouse has fears, hopes, dreams, goals.
Poor little guy.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
You know, Mr. Feeny, just between you and me, it's stuff like this that really makes you unpopular.
Sure.
And it's lonely at the top.
But I save a lot of money on call waiting.
What do you have against throwing an illegal rave?
- Hey, what is a rave, anyway?
- A rowdy underground party.
Get hip, Mr. Matthews.
- Topanga, do you think I'm unhip?
- Of course I don't.
Oh, you left your earmuffs at my house.
So, Cor, any advance word on where the party's gonna be?
- How the heck would I know?
- 'Cause Eric's throwing it.
What?
He hasn't said a word to me.
Since fifth grade, actually.
Eric, my brother.
What's up?
You throw the party of the year and I don't know about it.
How do you think that makes me look?
Short.
Come on, Eric.
I want in on this.
I can help you spread the word.
No!
Hey, Cor, this is my party.
I mean, I'm a senior, I'm gonna graduate in a year or two.
I'm gonna make my mark, OK?
I'm going out big at John Adams.
Come on, Eric.
For once you and I could actually do something together.
The two of us.
The Matthews brothers.
I mean, think how proud Mom and Dad would be.
Hey.
They can never know about this party.
Oh-ho, and who would they hear about it from?
- All right, you're in.
- Yes!
Cor, look, you can't say a word to anybody about this.
- You got it.
- OK.
- Shawn, guess who's - Hey!
Eric, everything's all set.
Chubbie's on board.
Oh, so he's cool with us having the rave at his place?
No.
I mean he's on board - a cruise to Mexico -which means he won't know.
- Aha, so finally we have a place to rave.
- Well, of course, because who are we?
The Matthews brothers.
Huh!
Get that.
- Hey, Mr. Lawrence.
- Ooh, harsh.
Sorry about that.
It's just weird calling my girlfriend's dad by his first name, and not just 'cause it's Jedediah.
Oh, Jedediah, let me see it.
Let me see it.
I love this moment.
Wow, it's beautiful.
And I know Alan'll love it, but in so many ways it doesn't look done.
I know.
I spent too much time on the case.
Well, I did say our anniversary's tomorrow.
Guys, keep Dad out of the kitchen.
Mr. Lawrence and I need to discuss reality.
Cool.
Eric, how could you plan the rave on the same day as Mom and Dad's anniversary?
Hey.
You're looking at me like I'm inconsiderate.
I had no idea when Mom and Dad's anniversary was, so there!
- What you got there, Dad?
- A 20th-anniversary present for your mom.
- And me.
- A tub?
A turbo-deluxe, Sunset-Tsunami-Super-Spa.
Yeah, this baby's got more jets than the Canadian air force.
Oh, for you and Mom, huh?
No, boys.
When you're 20 it's for romance.
At your dad's age it's a bubbly place to read.
- Hey!
You're older than I am, Gordy.
- And very well-read.
Did you hear that, Eric?
Mom and Dad's 20th anniversary.
- How could we have forgotten?
- Well, we weren't at the wedding.
- Well, we gotta get them a present.
- With what?
- We put all our money into the rave.
- Well, then maybe we should cancel it.
No.
We can't cancel Mom and Dad's anniversary.
I meant the rave.
Now you're talking crazy.
Get that.
Hello.
Is this by chance the Matthews' residence?
Ah, wait.
Wait.
I see it.
- See what?
- Amy's nose and brow.
Alan's eyes and pronounced chin.
You must be their son.
Wow, no one in my entire life's ever said I look like my parents.
Well, clearly no one else was an Oxford-schooled phrenologist.
Oh, are you the cable guy?
Hardly.
I'm an old friend of your parents.
Amy!
Amy, you look so lovely.
Goodness gracious.
You haven't changed.
Oh, that is so sweet.
- Who are you?
- Reg.
Reginald Fairfield.
Huh!
- Who was at the door?
- Reg.
Reginald Fairfield.
Alan.
From your college backpacking trip through Europe.
How are you?
Oh, oh Yeah.
You said if I were ever in the States, there'd be a couch with my name on it.
Dad, look.
Reg.
Reginald Fairfield.
August 18, 1974.
There we are in Windsor.
Do you remember, Alan?
To be honest, Reg, I don't remember what I had for breakfast.
Look at this.
Here we are jumping in the fountain at St. James's Park.
Hey, who's that sexy babe in that wet tank top?
She's pret - Oh, my God.
- OK.
End of walk down memory lane.
Well, I'd love to freshen up.
So, Reg, how long do you think you'll be staying with us?
Well, as long as I'm welcome.
Hear that, hon?
He left 20 minutes ago.
- I know.
He's a little - Annoying.
Well, be nice.
He did guide us through Europe.
He didn't guide us, he followed us.
Alan, do you have any softer towels than these?
And 20 years later he's picked up the trail.
So, tomorrow night, eight o'clock.
Yeah.
It's a secret party, so I wouldn't know anything about it.
Stop calling here.
- Dodged that bullet, eh?
- No, Eric.
I think it hit you right about here!
- Hey!
What was that for?
- Mom heard every word you said.
Oh, come on.
She has no idea what I'm talking about.
Hey, I'm gonna shoot over to Chubbie's, gonna give him the deposit Ooh, who's that sexy babe in the tank top?
- That would be Mom.
- Ur!
Ur!
Hello, Mum, sorry to wake you, but I have a free phone.
Amy, that man unpacked an awful lot of clothes.
Forget Reg, get this.
Tomorrow night our boys are throwing us a surprise anniversary party.
You're kidding.
They didn't forget for once.
They are really growing up.
- OK.
Hot tub's up and running.
- All right.
Darling, let's go test it out.
Uh, not so fast.
The little English guy's doing laps.
Eric, the rave is cancelled.
- What?
- Mom and Dad know.
Mamma mia!
Look, they think the rave is a surprise party for them.
- What are they, nuts?
- I know.
But it's their 20th anniversary, right?
And they're expecting a party, so we gotta give them one.
So much for making my mark.
Right now we've gotta cancel all the rave plans and turn this into a Mom-and-Dad party.
- In 24 hours?
- Hey, we can do this.
And we will, because hey hey, who are we?
Couple of great big stupidheads.
Come on, Aunt Sheila, it's Mom and Dad's Oh, really?
Well, I hope that donor comes through for you.
Yeah.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello Adults, adults, I need adults.
Adults.
Hey, Mr. Turner.
Gosh, that sounds so formal for a guy who's almost family.
You know, you guys never just come out and ask for a favor, do you?
It's not our way.
Anyhow, my parents are always saying how much they like you, and with their anniversary just around the corner, I am sure they'd love to have you at their party.
- Sure, why not?
When is it?
- Six hours, no jeans, bring a present.
Mr. Feeny.
Hey.
What are you doing tonight?
Hanging with Shawn Hunter at the mall.
You know, Mr. Feeny, that is just the kind of sense of humor that makes a guy the life of a party, OK?
Mom and Dad's anniversary, George!
George, I thought I'd lost you.
Yes, well, the best-laid plans Reg.
Reginald Fairfield, what are you doing here?
Well, your kind neighbor, Mr. Feeny, saw me over the fence and invited me for lunch.
I did not.
I merely said, "Good morning.
Are you staying with the Matthews"?
And here I am.
Reginald, I'm sorry, but I have a full morning of classes before lunch.
Why, thank you, George.
I would love to sit in.
I got you a band.
They're old guys in their 30s but I think they'll be OK.
And, Cor, I got you a guy who'll jump out of a cake.
- Why would I want that?
- It was six bucks, man.
- You paid a guy six bucks?
- No, he paid me.
Hey, Cor.
Cor, check it out.
I got the balloons.
Usually it takes two or three days, but I turned on the old Eric Matthews charm and got 300 of these babies printed up.
Check it out.
OK.
OK.
"Happy 20th, Amy and Ellen.
" - What?
- You better go get your money back, Eric.
Oh, what?
Am I supposed to do everything?
Fine, I'll do it.
I'll do it all.
OK.
I'll see you at the party.
Surprise, surprise.
They cancelled the rave.
I guess the guy throwing it wussed out.
Just once I'd like to meet a guy with some guts in this school.
Well, maybe he had a good reason.
Maybe he was doing something nice for his mommy and daddy.
- Well, you pulled this off, Cor.
- A full anniversary party in 24 hours.
Yeah, well, you know - Eric, what is this?
- A surprise party for Mom and Dad.
- Yeah, and who are these other people?
- These are all our friends from school.
And what are they doing at our parents' party?
That's right, I didn't tell you.
Good news, bro.
We're throwing both parties.
Eric, you realize right now our parents are on their way over here.
Yes, I do.
And when they arrive they'll have a blast.
I mean, come on.
They're fun people.
Ten buck cover charge.
That means you, Grandma.
No, uh, Frankie.
Frankie, no.
That's not Grandma, that's Aunt Liz.
Ten buck cover charge.
That means you, Aunt Liz.
Aunt Liz, why don't I just give your hand a little stamp?
You can go on in.
Thanks.
You see?
I mean, come on, you were worried.
This is working out great.
Frankie, Frankie!
From now on the only people you let through this door are the people on this anniversary list.
OK?
OK.
- Whoa!
Name?
- Oh, give me a break.
Topanga, I need your help.
We gotta clear out the ravers before it's too late.
- Cor?
It's too late.
- What?
Cory?
Cory, Cory, Cory.
The cheerleaders are chocolate-wrestling in the kitchen.
Well, stop 'em!
Oh, OK, but I'm gonna need a can of whipped cream and a really big spoon.
Oh, gosh.
All right, I know what I'll do.
I'll go upstairs, I'll intercept my parents, and I'll tell them that the party's at the restaurant across the street.
You guys get the anniversary guests and meet us there.
OK?
Yeah, so, you know, Wanda, after this party there's a much more exclusive party, and I'm only inviting people named Wanda.
Excuse me, Mr. Bull?
A word.
My valet.
Excuse me.
Cor, Cor, Cor.
Look at that.
She's Wanda.
She doesn't even go to our school, man.
This rave is so big.
Yeah, whoopee.
Look, Eric, if we hurry we can still get all Mom and Dad's friends across the street before they get here.
- Your parents are here.
- Of course they are.
- Eight o'clock, just like you wanted.
- Yes, they're right outside the front door.
Oh, by the way, thank you for the lift, Gordon.
Well, I really didn't have much choice, did I?
You were sitting in my car.
Oh!
Hey, there.
All right.
Hey, how are you all doing?
Yeah!
See, guys, for this party we're gonna try something a little different, a little wacky!
OK.
See, this party's got a theme, guys.
And that theme is - are you ready?
That theme is a wedding anniversary.
You know, like a uh, a surprise party.
So let's pretend that the next two people walking down those stairs are celebrating their anniversary.
Now, when you see the happy couple, I want you all to shout "Surprise.
" Fun, huh?
Huh?
Oh, kill the lights.
Surprise!
Now I know why I never come here.
Hey, Matthews.
By the way, English class, tomorrow morning?
Ten-dollar cover.
Oh, your folks are outside.
They're trying to get in.
If you're not on this list, you don't get in.
But the surprise party is for us.
For you?
Then how come you know about it?
Mom, Dad Frankie, it's all right, they're with me.
OK?
- Yeah, but you said that - Everything I've ever said to you, forget it.
OK.
Everybody in.
I suppose you guys are probably wondering Hey, Cor, give it up.
It's Mom and Dad.
We can't get anything past these guys.
- No, we can't.
- Yeah, you know, I mean, it was pretty darn crazy to think we could keep this a secret.
Eric, it's a little late for that.
I don't think we should Keep their guests waiting?
You know something?
I completely agree.
Why don't you guys go downstairs?
And try to act surprised.
Mom, Dad, happy big two-O.
Just how big a kook are you?
Hey, I'm a big enough kook to know that by tomorrow we'll be John Adams legends.
And they won't have suspected a thing.
Uh, Eric, uh, who who are these people?
Oh, Daddy.
Does family mean nothing to you?
Well, Mr. Matthews, quite a party.
Everybody's raving.
You're not gonna tell my parents, are you, Mr. Feeny?
- No.
- Thank you.
So long as the man in the neon mohawk doesn't touch me.
Uh, Cory, Cory?
Could you tell me how we're related to them?
Well, um, Dad, um - Eric, Eric?
Them.
- Dad, do you remember Uncle Howard?
How you guys had that big blowout a few years ago?
- Uh-huh.
- Those are his kids.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Wow.
- Yeah.
Hey, you with the neon mohawk, don't touch that man.
Listen, guys, I just want to tell you that, whatever happened between me and your dad, well, that was my fault.
You have no idea what I'm talking about, do you?
I'm really frightening you now, aren't I?
Since it's your anniversary, this is for you.
- My watch.
- That's how I knew you'd like it.
Honey.
Having a good time at our party?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
You?
Oh, yeah.
You know what, Eric?
- We just might actually get away with this.
- Mm-hm.
Tomorrow we'll be John Adams legends, and do you wanna know the best part?
- What's that?
- Your parents don't have a clue.
- Exactly.
- Yeah.
Look, when you found out, we tried to turn it into your anniversary party.
In fact, I stayed up all night inviting people.
- All night, huh?
- Oh, gee.
All that time and effort.
You know, a card would've done it.
Even that would've shown some thought.
But this?
This just shows that your friends mean more to you than your parents.
- No, it wasn't that.
- Well, then, what?
I just wanted one night, you know?
I mean, one night where I'd be remembered.
So did we.
- Dad, we're really sorry.
- No, look, it wasn't Cory's fault.
I mean, he wanted to do something special for you, and I I kinda screwed it up.
You know, every once in a while it wouldn't hurt to do, oh, one little thing for your parents.
- Where are you going?
- I don't know.
To help Mom collect the relatives, take them over to the house for coffee or something.
Cor, Cor, I mean, we've gotta do something.
We gotta make it up to them.
Hope I'm not too late.
It was kinda cloudy and I didn't know when the sun went down.
Your mom wanted me to bring this by.
- That's it.
Come on.
Just come on!
- What?
What?
Gordy, you were the best man at my parents' wedding.
Their wedding song - do you remember what it was?
- Uh, yeah.
"My Girl.
" - Cory, what are you thinking?
We can have the band play it.
Shawn, do you know where the band went?
They weren't on the list, so Frankie sent them away.
Frankie, you ruined the party.
How could you do this?
Tippy, Tippy.
Have you been eating meat?
Cory wants his parents' wedding song played for them, and this mall rat sent the band away.
And I might have had a meatball.
Well, the equipment's still here.
That's not a problem, I'll play.
Yeah, me too.
Let's see, "My Girl.
" How does that go?
Well, I remember the melody.
I'm kinda blanking on the lyrics.
- Yeah, me too.
- Well, I suppose if you're asking me, I wouldn't mind helping you out.
Er, key of key of D, gentlemen, please.
- Mom, Dad, you can't leave yet.
- Give us one good reason.
Honey, they're playing our song.
I got sunshine On a cloudy day How did they know?
Eric told them.
I got the month of May I guess You'd say What can make me feel this way My girl - My girl - My girl Talkin' 'bout my girl My girl You see, I knew this would all work out.
It worked out for you, and it worked out for me.
Guys, I want you to meet the woman I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with.
- We've met.
Meet your cousin, Wanda.
- Oh!
Ur!
I guess You'd say What can make me feel this way My girl My girl Talkin' 'bout my girl My girl My girl My girl My girl Huh!
I'm gonna tell you how it's gonna be You're gonna give your love to me I'm gonna love you both night and day Love is real and not fade away Love is real and not fade away - My love's bigger than a Cadillac - Whoo!

Nice sound.
Yeah.
Love is real and not fade away Love is real and not fade away - Hey!
- Yeah!
Yep!
You see, I knew this would all work out.
You know why?
Because we are Very, very lucky.
Very nice.
Thank you.
So, Gordon, Alan Matthews tells me you have a lovely big home with lots of extra bedrooms.
Oh, did he?
Well, it's barely a shack compared to Jedediah's place.
Freestanding guesthouse.
Ooh!
Perfect.
If you even drive down my street, you're a dead man.
Excuse me.
I'd just like to tell you that I really liked what I heard.
Oh.
Nah, it was nothing.
We were just messing around.
No, no, no.
You guys really got something.
I mean, believe me.
I know what I'm talking about.
I used to manage a band.
Well, a few years ago.
It's a family group.
Still got the bus we toured in!
The name sounds familiar.
It sure would be nice to be able to be able to handle an act without a mother in it.
Well, so, call me.
You know, you guys could be bigger than the Beatles.
- Bigger than the Beatles.
- Hm.
Nah!
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Topanga, how could you be sick?
I mean, you said you'd never catch a cold as long as you were taking that trout fluid.
It's fish oil and I'll be fine.
Just take good notes for me and I'll be back in school Monday.
I miss you so much and I'll call you after next period Topi.
Ahh.
Oh, drop dead.
We're in love.
Not us.
Do that again and I will hurt you.
Shawn, I'm not embarrassed about it.
I mean, Topanga and I are serious.
- We do everything together.
- Hi, Cory.
Love that shirt.
Hey, thanks.
Underneath it I'm half-naked.
You and Topanga do everything together, huh?
Even flirt with Libby Harper?
Flirt?
I was just being friendly.
And besides, girls like Libby Harper don't flirt with me.
That was before.
Now you have "the scent.
" Well, what exactly is "the scent"?
- I'll tell you about "the scent.
" - All right, stop.
- It means women want you.
- Why?
Because they can't have you.
You're with Topanga, they think you're unavailable, virgo, they want you.
- You're batty.
- So one girl may have flirted with me.
You're making it sound like all girls I don't know, Missy Robinson, are gonna come over and suddenly make small talk.
- Cory?
- Yes, Missy?
Did you know the sun sets today at 6:52?
I did not know that.
Shawn And then the papa bear said, "Missy's taking Topanga's seat.
" Hold onto your porridge, Cor.
Shh.
I'm trying to listen to what Feeny's saying.
All right.
Mr. Matthews, what was I saying?
I- I-I was too busy absorbing to listen.
Very good.
- Mr. Hunter?
- Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal.
Dear Lord, he's right.
It's been my answer for two years, Mr. Feeny.
Sooner or later, it had to pay off.
Now, don't forget, for next week's assignment you'll need to choose partners.
- Shawn?
- Who else?
Mr. Matthews, Mr. Hunter, spread the wealth, hm?
But Mr. Feeny, you can't split us up.
Oh, Cor, this is plain wrong.
He can't break us up like that.
I mean, if I can't do this project with you, my very best friend in the world, then I'm just not gonna.
- Hey, Shawn, got a partner?
- Gotta go.
How did I not see that coming?
Cory.
Trini.
What am I gonna do?
Topanga's my best friend.
She's always my partner.
You know, there are so few people who get me.
- Really, now?
- Oh, yeah.
I can call her at, like, three in the morning and not say one single thing, yet somehow, she knows it's me.
Go figure.
Hey, listen, since I don't have a partner and you don't have a partner You're right.
We'd better both get looking.
Cory.
Do you want to work with me on the project?
Uh Actually, I think I'm gonna go solo on this one.
You know, work twice as hard.
'Cause I have the strength of ten men.
- So funny.
- Am I?
- And cute.
- No.
But if you're set on working alone Miss Martin still needs a partner.
Anyone not paired up?
Mr. Matthews?
Taken.
And don't worry.
Your girlfriend, Topo Gigio, won't mind.
Actually, it's Topanga.
Whatever.
- What are you looking for?
- You're not gonna believe this.
I go to pay for my lunch and Bertha says: "Don't worry, it's already taken care of.
" This makes no sense.
Cory.
Over here.
- All right, Corrance.
- What?
You still don't smell it, do you?
The shawarma in a pocket?
They said it was fresh.
- No, I'm talking about "the scent.
" - Stop with the fingers.
Cory, I saved you a seat.
All right, look.
I'm gonna go over there, but only to talk about the history assignment.
- Hey, Cor, remember - I know, just be myself.
No.
Be me.
Jonathan, Eli.
- I'm glad I caught you.
- It's lunchtime.
Where else would we be?
Anyway, this is my last day to get pledges for the charity walkathon.
- It's for the homeless, you know?
- George, you already put me down for two bucks a mile.
Oh, shame on you.
Two dollars a mile.
Good old Janitor Bud himself pledged twice that much and he's a man of no fixed address.
You gotta beat Bud, man.
All right, fine.
Put me down for five bucks a mile and that's it.
I knew I could count on you, Johnny.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Now, Mr. Williams, how much can we massage out of your wallet, hm?
- Well, I'm always up for a good cause.
- Oh, I like your thinking.
Hey, hey, are you all right, George?
Oh, no, it's nothing at all.
It's just that when the weather gets damp, my joints tend to swell.
- Are you gonna be able to do this walk?
- Oh, I must.
Especially after last year's fiasco.
I was a no-show.
My knee swelled up like an eggplant.
Why don't I just write you a check for 50 bucks, that way you don't have to hurt yourself, huh?
No, no, no, no.
It's for charity.
Even if I just walk a block or two, the pain would be well worth the few dollars I collect.
- You know what, George?
- Mm?
You're all right.
Tell you what.
Put me down for 50 bucks a mile.
Huh?
So that way, if you don't even get past the first mile, you still got my 50.
Oh.
Ooh.
Not too tight.
So then I started using a new moisturizer.
Here, feel.
Yep.
Moist.
It somehow reminds me of our history project.
My skin reminds you of the Great Depression?
No.
Not all of it.
Just the last part when the people got all happy again.
So, our history project, shall we start this weekend?
Actually, this weekend's not good for me, with my party and all.
- Oh, you're having a party?
- Oh, you didn't know about it?
Well, you should come.
Bring Shawn.
Well, I think at least one of us should plow ahead with the project.
On a Friday night?
Come on, Cory, just come.
Please?
OK, but do you think we'll be able to find some time to talk about the Great Depression?
- Wouldn't be a party if we didn't.
- Cory.
Do you want to come with me over to Topanga's after school?
What?
You think you're the only person who cares about poor sick Topanga?
I'll have you know that I love the girl.
And she's all I think about.
I'm thinking about her now.
And now.
And now I'm going over there to think about her.
Yeah, I do some of my best studying at parties.
Shawn, really.
This is all innocent.
I'm gonna go to the party, have a good time and nothing's gonna happen because I'm my own person and I don't care what anybody else thinks.
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna run it by Topanga.
- Hey, Hunter, take this.
- OK.
Whoa!
Good thing I'm hanging a picture, huh?
Eric, I had to wrestle this away from Shawn.
He said you gave it to him.
You can relax, Dad.
With the money I'm gonna be making you, you can afford to buy yourself a whole new family.
Well, that's a very tempting offer right now.
Who is that poor man with the swollen head hanging over my fireplace?
That man is gonna be paying for my college intuition.
Where do I begin?
Mom, Dad, I got one word for you.
- Baseball collectibles are hot.
- How much?
Only 200 macaroons.
For a signed photo of Teddy "Beanbag" Bagwell?
That man is a bum!
No picture of the Bag is gonna be worth $200.
Obviously the guy didn't know what he had in his store.
When you walked in I bet he did.
Dad, what the store guy didn't know is that Baggie is only two hit by pitches away from the all-time major league record.
Two more bean balls, we all go to college.
Ok, so who holds the record now for getting hit in the head?
I'm thinking Eric.
So anywho, I couldn't get a partner for the project, so Mr. Feeny said that he and I would do it together.
but to never call him again.
Topanga, your mom said to come right up.
But she didn't say Trini was here.
Yea.
Now that Cory's here I am sure that you two don't want me hanging around.
- Well, actually, Trini - Oh, OK.
I'll stay, but just for one more hour.
I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.
Nobody gets me.
She's making a lot of progress.
- So tell me how your day was.
- Oh.
Very uneventful.
Nothing happened?
Well, in Feeny's class I got partnered up with - What's her name?
- Missy Robinson.
I know.
Trini told me.
Yeah.
Missy.
Kind of a dumb name, huh, Topanga?
But anyway, the girl's kind of a flake.
I mean, we have this huge history project and all she can talk about is her dumb party tonight.
Trini didn't say anything about a party.
Well, not many people tell Trini about parties.
- So are you going?
- Oh, please.
Without you?
Huh?
- Why don't you go?
It sounds like fun.
- Really?
Yeah, go.
OK.
OK.
But I'll tell you what, on my way back I'll pick you up some ice cream for your throat.
- You don't have to do that.
- But I want to.
Trust me.
OK, well, as long as it's made with organic rice milk.
But if they don't have that, Chunky Monkey Double Fudge with jimmies.
- You got it.
- Don't be too late.
If I'm not here by nine o'clock then we must be at war.
Huh?
I'll be here.
I'll be here.
Hi, guys.
- Are we early or something?
- No.
You're right on time.
Oh, wait a minute.
Is this a surprise party?
In a way.
Come on.
What's going on?
Where is everybody?
- This is everybody.
Surprise!
- Surprise!
That's right.
It's just the four of us.
- What are we gonna do?
- You take Missy, I'll take Libby.
No, no.
I have a girlfriend.
Her name is Topanga.
I just love your shirt.
Thanks.
It rhymes with your skirt.
Shawn, you didn't have anything to do with this, did you?
No, I dreamed it once, but you weren't here.
All right, look.
Easy way out of this, you and me, we stick together.
Side by side.
Two pillars of strength.
Oh, wow.
A- a-a-ahh.
Uhhh Ah Oh, just go!
So, Cory, - I'm really glad you came.
- Thank you.
You didn't say anything about my dress.
Oh.
It's very pretty.
My girlfriend, Topanga, has one just like it, but longer.
Let's sit down, Cory.
Hi.
Lunchroom lady, lunchroom lady, lunchroom lady.
- Cory, are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
Oh, look.
Heads.
They're my dad's.
But don't worry, he's never shot a boy I liked.
You like me?
Do you see me talking to any of the other guests?
Of course I like you, what I know about you, but I'd like to know a lot more.
I'm gonna stare deep into your eyes until I discover it all.
Well, I was born in Jefferson Hospital.
They tell me it was drizzling that day.
I loved my blue blankie.
And then in the fourth grade, the first day at gym, I found out the awful truth.
I had flat feet.
But Miss Spivey, the nurse, assured me that I'd lead a healthy and normal life, so that was cool.
- Cory.
- What?
Why don't we skip ahead to now?
Well, there's really not much going on now, except you and me and the heads.
Then let's make it interesting.
Come here, you.
But, I mean, you can't blame the entire Great Depression on Herbert Hoover.
I wouldn't think of it.
But here's what I am thinking.
Missy Robinson, you're trying to seduce me.
I wish I were doing better.
We're not even making out yet and it's past nine o'clock.
Nine o' Nine o'clock.
We're at war!
I need a phone!
Look.
I gotta talk to someone.
Do you have a cordless?
Sorry.
- That's a closet!
- Perfect.
Hi, Topanga.
Yeah, it's me, Cory.
I just wanted to let you know I'm on my way to Chubbie's to pick you up your Chunky Monkey.
Yeah.
Oh, the party, there's a lot of no-shows, but Oh.
Ohh!
Susannah, well, don't you cry for me No, you know when a song just pops into your head?
Yeah, I-I'm fine.
All right, all right, bye.
You are not getting out of here this easy.
Look, Missy, I don't think I can do this.
I think you very well can do this.
No, no, no.
Look, Missy, I have a girlfriend.
I should be with her.
But, I mean, you're a very nice person and clearly attractive, but - Get out of here now!
- a little oversensitive.
No!
No, my father's here.
- Your father?
- Yes!
And I am not supposed to have boys over.
You've got to get out of here fast.
- And how fast would that be?
- Do you see those deer?
- Yeah.
- Faster.
Get out!
Don't shoot, please.
Oh, good, it's you.
I want my best friend here when I die.
Relax.
There isn't a basement in this town I haven't escaped from.
Well, then do it, quick.
Back stairs, through the garage, over the fence, you'll land in some shrubs and it's a 30-yard dash to the highway.
Go!
I've got a hunch you've done this before.
Oh, wild pitch for the walk.
And coming up to the plate, Teddy "Beanbag" Bagwell.
Hey, Mom, Dad, come on down, it's bag time!
All right, let me get this straight.
Bagwell gets beaned two more times and then this worthless picture becomes a priceless treasure?
You're proud of me, aren't you?
- Are they leading him to home plate?
- Oh, yeah.
In the last game, he got hit in the head so many times his eyes were swollen shut.
- You guys hear that?
- What?
Ch-ching!
Ch-ching!
As Bagwell sets in the box let me remind you that the southpaw, Darren Lee, has been unbelievably wild tonight.
Daddy, it's too easy.
Here's the pitch.
Ouch!
Boy, oh, boy, you sure hate to see that.
Yes!
Yes!
Eric!
He's been hit, he's on the ground.
- He's not even moving.
- Sit down!
Yeah, look, I'm sorry.
You're right.
Too early to celebrate.
One more to the head then we all party.
What's this?
From his stretcher, Bagwell's requesting a microphone.
I have never seen anything like this.
Today, I consider myself the stupidest man on the face of the earth.
I quit baseball.
Oh, Baggy, Baggy, say it ain't so.
- 200 macaroons down the drain.
- No, no!
He'll be back.
Mark my words, that man plays baseball again or my name isn't Eric Neil Matthews.
That's not your middle name.
- Wow.
We made it here in ten minutes.
- Good thing we took the highway.
Listen, I gotta get the ice cream and get to Topanga's.
Do you have any cash?
The tollbooth guy wiped me out.
Yo, counterman, give me a quart of your finest Chunky Monkey Double Fudge.
Why did I do it, Shawn?
Why did I kiss Missy Robinson?
Better question, why are you telling everyone in Chubbie's?
What a wild imagination I have, huh?
Cory, the way I see it, Missy attacked you.
You're the victim here.
Yeah, you're right.
I'm the victim.
She was a circling great white shark and I was a little anchovy.
- You mean anch-oh-vy.
- Yeah.
Anchovy.
Cory, settle down.
You're home free.
You kissed another girl and you're actually gonna get away with it.
Hello, Topanga.
Oh, that is so not even funny, because if she Oh, Susannah, well, don't you cry for me Everybody!
'Cause I come from Alabama with my banjo on my knee Topanga, we're just singing.
What are you doing here?
I had to get out of the house.
Besides, it was getting late.
- I thought you might have forgot about me.
- Forgot?
Does this look like I forgot?
Yeah, trusty old Cory.
I'd better go.
I told my mom I'd be right home.
Is it all right if I don't kiss you?
I'm still a little germy.
I'll call you tomorrow.
Like I said, home free.
Home nothing.
Topanga, wait!
What's the matter?
- Look, I can't lie to you.
- About what?
About tonight.
I, uh I accidentally kissed Missy Robinson.
- How do you accidentally kiss someone?
- Well I mean, did she slip on a rug and your lips broke her fall?
No.
I didn't go there to kiss her, it just happened.
- I feel terrible about it.
- Well, why did you do it?
- I wasn't thinking.
- And that's supposed to make it OK?
No.
No.
Look.
All I know is I've never felt worse than I do right now.
You should feel bad.
I feel bad.
So now what do I do?
Hopefully not what I deserve.
So tell me, Cory, how did she kiss you?
Was it like this?
- Topanga, do we have to do this here?
- I need to know, Cory.
Or was it more like this?
No, it wasn't like that.
That's the first time anyone's ever kissed me like that before.
And, Cory Matthews, it's going to be the last time if you ever do anything like that again.
- Hey, John, have you seen George yet?
- No, Why?
I'm kinda worried about him.
He had that walkathon yesterday and with his bad knee and all.
Bad knee?
Who told you that?
Eli!
Jonathan!
Ah, gentlemen, there is nothing like a good ten-mile walk to invigorate the body and lift the soul.
- Ten miles?
- Good for you, George.
I owe you 50 bucks.
Wait.
Ten miles, as in ten more than you what were supposed to do?
Well, I caught a good wind.
- So, that means you owe me - $500?
You took me, George.
I'm sure I have no idea what you're talking about.
Uh-oh.
Oh, boy.
Better put a little ice on this knee.
- So, John, can you buy me lunch?
- Sure.
All year?
Does it feel like knives in your throat every time you swallow?
I don't know.
I haven't swallowed all day.
- Sounds like you've got what I had.
- I don't think I'll ever get off this couch.
Don't worry.
I've sent something over that'll have you on your feet in no time.
Hello, Corpuscle!
I am here to help you get better.
All better.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Cory!
Cory, guess what.
For New Year's Eve, I got us a limousine.
- A limousine?
- Yeah, yeah.
That's short for "limo.
" My Uncle Laslo's stretch limo.
He's not busy that night, so he's gonna be our chauffeur.
Wow, that's great.
You know, Topanga's gonna love this.
I mean, we can go to any party, anytime.
- Boys.
Quick, where are your parents?
- Oh, they're out, Mr. Feeny.
Why?
My cab to the airport is waiting, and all I have is traveler's checks, so I - You're asking us for money, aren't you?
- Yes, I've hit bottom.
Welcome!
Please, gentlemen.
I miss this flight, I kiss my week in the Bahamas goodbye.
Mr. Feeny, my man, you're in luck.
I just happen to have some of my No, no, no, no.
Cor, please.
Allow me.
Would, uh, 20 bucks get you to the airport?
I suppose.
Cor, lend me 20 bucks.
Come on.
You know, if you had thought about this ahead of time, - you wouldn't be in this situation.
- Yes, yes, yes.
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.
- Thank you!
- Hey.
Hey, you don't have to shout.
Penne arrabbiata!
Shawn, you just wished him a spicy pasta.
- I know.
- Oh, my God!
No!
No!
- No way!
- Eric, what's the matter?
Hot cha-cha!
- I heard screaming.
Something wrong?
- Oh, Dad.
Thanks for giving birth to me.
- I was there too.
- Oh, right.
Kudos, Mom.
Get this.
Your firstborn, the fruit of your loom, has a dream date this New Year's Eve with supermodel Rebecca-Alexa.
Rebecca-Alexa?
The jeans girl?
The one with the?
- Yes!
- And the?
- Yes!
- No!
- Yes, yes, yes!
- Eric, how did you scam this?
She's Jason's second cousin, she's in from out of town, she needs a date, so she's going out with me!
I am just so happy!
All those long, hard years of dating finally paid off, huh?
Well, not for her, but Oh.
No, just think.
I mean, when that clock strikes 12, I'll be kissing the famous blonde lips of supermodel Rebecca-Alexa in front of all of Philly.
Oh!
Mommy, Daddy catch me.
Amy!
Let's go.
New Year's Eve.
Big night.
Fun, fun, fun.
Let's get it over with!
- Alan, I'm still shaving my legs.
- Well, finish in the car.
Let's go.
OK, Dad.
I need your honest opinion.
How do I look?
Do I look fat?
Eric, for the last time, she's just a girl, it's just a date with someone who happens to be a model.
I'm a fat-fatty-fat.
Wow!
Whoo!
Hey.
Well worth the wait.
Which really wasn't that long.
Oh, Eric.
You look so handsome.
- Really?
- Absolutely.
Too handsome?
All right, Mom.
I'm gonna wait outside for Shawn, OK?
All right, stop.
Wait.
Let me look at you.
Come here.
Mom Oh, Alan.
Remember when the two of 'em would stay up late on New Year's Eve and eat popcorn and watch the ball drop?
What has happened to my babies?
Dad, she's not gonna cry now, is she?
Amy.
Mascara.
We haven't got that kind of time.
Oh, admit it, boys.
Those were great times.
Oh, sure.
I mean, you guys got to go out.
I was stuck here with Cory, trying to pull Raisinets out of his nose.
Yeah, if it wasn't for those shrimp forks, they'd still be up there.
You know, I haven't heard a thank-you.
Now, guys, be careful tonight.
You know, New Year's Eve brings out all the crazies.
Come on, everybody!
Let's get crazy!
- He's on my side.
- Cory, Uncle Laslo and our limo await.
- Why does that limo look so strange?
- Maybe because it's a hearse.
- That's cool.
- Yeah.
Wait till you see what's in the back seat.
Eric, you're gonna have to move that old rusty excuse for a car out of the driveway.
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey.
You're talkin' about my Lucille here.
Now, I mean, granted, she's not the most reliable car, but she gets me where I gotta be goin'.
Hey, there's nothin' you guys can say or do to pull me away from her.
- Eric, why don't you take our car tonight?
- OK, sure.
- Amy!
- No, Alan.
I don't want him driving that thing downtown.
- Here are the keys.
We'll take your car.
- OK, great.
Here are the pliers.
You want it to start, don't you?
Man, I am so glad we're spending New Year's Eve at home.
Yup.
No suits, no ties, no spending You don't know how close I came to ringing in the New Year with Janine.
- The clinger?
- Yeah.
She's OK, you know, if your mother's got plans.
I'm telling you, man, you should have stuck with Valerie.
Oh, no, no.
Two weeks was enough for me.
That girl had way too much baggage.
Our first date, she had to bring a skycap.
- No, this was not my year for women.
- Or mine.
Speaking of which, I ran into Rochelle the other day.
- Oh, yeah?
How how'd she look?
- Not so good.
- Ah, thanks, man.
- I'm lying.
I knew that.
Anyway, it's good to have the night off.
- That's right.
We got beer - Yes, sir.
Ah!
Pizza.
Yes.
- And Janine.
- Jonathan, first of all, relax.
I'm not staying.
- Come on in, Janine.
- But I saw your light on, and I know you hate to be alone, so - No, that's you, Janine.
- Right.
Anyway, I wanted to make sure you were OK.
- He's OK.
- Oh, hi, Eli.
Happy New Year.
- Jonathan, you look thin.
- Well, thanks.
It's not a compliment.
- You know what would be just terrif?
- What?
How about if I whip you up a nice lasagna?
- No, no, no.
Look, I don't - Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Lasagna, man.
No, that's real nice, Janine, really.
But we got a pizza coming and everything, so See?
See, there it is.
Somebody order a pizza with everything on it?
- Valerie.
- A very happy New Year.
Somewhere.
Val?
Janine?
Oh, my God!
Nice going, Shawn.
Without Uncle Laslo's hearse, how are we gonna make it to the parties?
Hey, hey.
It's not my fault, OK?
You see a corpse breathing, you've gotta take it back.
It's the right thing to do, man.
Look, I'm happy for the stiff, all right?
But it really stuck it to a lot of people.
Gee, guys, it's New Year's Eve.
- A time to celebrate, not fight.
- You know what?
You're right, Topanga.
OK.
And we're gonna make this the best New Year's Eve ever.
If we were dead, 'cause then we'd have a ride.
Oh, Rebecca-Alexa, I am so sorry the car broke down.
Eric, don't worry about it.
These things happen.
You understand?
You're not mean and icy?
Oh!
You are a super-duper model.
Oh, my God.
Do do you know who you are?
You're Rebecca-Alexa.
I'm a big, big, big fan.
I- I'm huge.
- Thank you.
- Hi.
Hi.
I- I'm Cory.
I'm Eric's brother.
Um, this is Topanga.
- She's a girl from school, but - Cory?
She's also my girlfriend, and I love her very much, so, uh, don't get any ideas.
So so, do supermodels have any special powers?
I mean, like, can you read what I'm thinking?
Yes.
I'm really sorry.
Rebecca-Alexa, I lucked out.
I got us the last cab in Philly.
- Oh, Eric, you gotta let us share it.
- All right, let me think.
I'm seeing a big, hairy "no.
" Eric, this is my first New Year's Eve out of the house, all right?
- I mean, without this cab, we're stranded.
- All right, hold on, hold on.
No, I tried.
I just can't care less.
Cory, I know how you feel.
My older sister never took me anywhere.
- I never forgave her.
- Cor, great idea.
Why don't you share our cab, bud?
Why, thanks, Eric.
What made you change your mind?
Why don't you come over here, and I'll tell you?
You say one sentence to me or my date, it'd better be, "Help, I'm flyin' out the cab window.
" Oh, Eric, don't you worry about that.
I am not gonna do anything stupid.
Cory, how could you do something so stupid?
You sent away the last cab in the city.
Look, I'm telling you.
There was something weird about that driver.
I mean, didn't you see his license in the windshield?
It wasn't even his picture.
Cory, if stupidity was in the Olympics, you'd win a Nobel prize.
Look, Eric, the man was obviously an impostor, OK?
I mean, for all I know, he was gonna take us to some warehouse and cut out our livers.
Hey, no biggie.
I've already had mine out.
Rebecca-Alexa, I apologize for all the stupidity that runs in this family.
- I'm just a carrier.
- It's no big deal.
I don't need to go to a big, crowded party with everyone staring at us.
- Oh, we're goin', baby.
- Hey!
Light bulb.
Why don't we just have our own little party right here?
I'm telling you, it'll be so much fun making popcorn, watching the ball drop All right, all right.
Cory, make it stop.
Look, Rebecca-Alexa, one way or another, we are gonna be seen at that party.
How?
I mean, what are we gonna do?
Take the subway?
- Great idea, Rebecca.
- I wasn't being serious.
Well, then, you lucked out, 'cause this is fun.
I mean ridin' the rails in a mighty locomotive.
I think I can, I think I can, I think I can It's nice to see you in a better mood, brother.
- Just die.
- Isn't this great?
There is something so exciting about doing things by the seat of your pants.
Yeah, like that guy.
Ohh!
Gosh!
Hey, Cory, why do I feel like we're being watched?
- You feel that too?
- Yeah, it's weird.
You know, it it feels kinda like OK.
Come on.
Let's do it, people.
We've got parties to go to.
What's your rush, Shawn?
It's only 10:30.
We have plenty of time before midnight.
Yeah.
And, Eric, you'll be kissing Rebecca in front of all of Philly, just like you wanted.
In front of all of Philly?
You know, I don't know where he gets this kinda stuff.
So your brother thinks of me as just a trophy?
- Yes!
- Cory!
How do you lie to a supermodel?
I mean, those lips can see right through you.
Eric?
I just remembered.
I have to go home.
What?
No, wait!
Rebecca-Alexa!
No!
Rebecca-Alexa!
No, wait!
Stop the train!
Stop the train!
Rebecca-Alexa!
My God!
Eric!
It's OK.
I have to get off the train.
I have to get off the train!
No.
Look, you can get off at the next stop, all right?
There aren't any cabs left in the city.
She can't get too far.
Trust me, OK?
Everything is gonna be dandy.
What did you do?
- Nothing.
- Ladies and gentlemen, this is your We seem to be experiencing a major - What did he say?
- He said Cory broke the train.
Trapped on a subway.
This is a nightmare!
Look, no one's gonna bother us if we just act tough, OK?
Boy, I love New Year's Eve.
I'd sure hate to have to kill somebody, though.
With my flu virus.
OK, if I could just pry my fingers into the door they would get stuck, like this.
Ohh!
Agh!
Attention, passengers.
The is still not functioning.
Do not, under any circumstances which may result in death or dismemberment.
Now what did he say?
He said, "Cory, go out and lick the third rail.
" Hey!
Buck up, buckers.
It's probably just a teeny electrical problem.
And look on the bright side.
The city is saving on electricity.
What is it with you tonight, Topanga?
Did you swallow Sandy Duncan?
That's it, Cory Matthews.
I am sick of being the rah-rah girl!
You try being the positive one all the time, and using words like "buckers.
" I have demons, so there!
Wow.
What a rush.
You, uh you guys don't spend a lot of time on the subway, do you?
Not on subways this nice.
- So, uh, what do you think the problem is?
- A loose wire, an air blow in the Cineston.
Duh.
- How long till they fix it?
- On a holiday?
It's hard to say, man.
Hello?
Hello?
Eric Matthews to bridge, Eric Matthews to bridge.
OK, guys.
I have been up and down this train, and here's the scoop.
Car five, parochial schoolgirls who ditched their nun.
Nice!
For Shawn.
Oh, and car two, Mrs. Ginelli just went into labor.
I saw the head.
- Hey, what are you eating there?
- Oh, that's the best part.
Some caterers are stuck in the next car.
Look.
Look, it's a tiny, tiny crab cake.
- In a light pastry shell.
- Will you forget about the crab cake?
The subway.
The subway, can they fix it?
What's wrong with it?
Why would I ask?
We've got food, babes and birth.
Eric, the cycle of life is complete.
Not without Rebecca-Alexa.
Hello?
Hello, if there's any intelligent life out there that can hear my voice Get off the box, kid.
This line is for emergencies only.
Look, sir, believe me, I have an emergency.
I am right now missing my date with supermodel Rebecca-Alexa.
- The jeans girl?
- Yes, my captain.
Life's tough.
Hey, Ernie, is that a crab cake?
Oh, no!
- I didn't know you went out with Jonathan.
- Oh, man.
Eli, I'm getting killed over there.
I know.
Shh.
- How'd he end it with you?
- He took me to dinner.
- Italian?
- Yeah.
And then he tells me, "Look.
" "You deserve to be with someone who can really appreciate you.
" - "I'm just not ready " - " for such a big commitment.
" Well, if I'm so horrible, what are you guys both doing here?
Hey, hey.
Don't bring 'em down, man.
They're having a good time.
- Uh, Eli?
- Yeah?
You wanna give me a hand with these plates?
Well, you know, I would, Jonathan, but, uh I don't think I'm ready for such a big commitment.
Oh, that's a burly look.
What are you doin'?
You're supposed to be helpin' me get rid of them.
Look, they're not goin' anywhere.
We may as well just sit back and enjoy it.
You do that.
Meanwhile, I'll light myself on fire and I'll do a happy dance.
There's something so nice about being around women.
Yeah, but the reason we planned this whole night is that we wouldn't have to be around women.
I lied.
So, Timmy, you tiger, here's the plan: I'm gonna lower you down.
When your feet hit the tracks, I want you to start running.
You're gonna find this girl, and give her this note.
OK?
Take the note, Timmy.
Now run like the wind, Timmy.
Run like the wind, Timmy.
Timmy Hey, lady!
You just take care of you, all right?
OK!
Mrs. Ginelli's real close.
Does anybody here know anything about deliveries?
You.
Pizza guy.
You'll have to do.
Come on!
Eric looks very upset.
You should talk to him.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Eric, I'm, you know You!
You're the reason for all of this.
You climbed out of my cab and sent it away.
You told Rebecca-Alexa I wanted to kiss her in front of all of Philadelphia, thus foiling my divine plan!
I'm sorry your night with Rebecca-Alexa didn't work out, OK?
All I wanted was a big party, with a lot of people having a good time.
You think this is how I wanted to spend my night?
I mean, you'd have to be an idiot to have a good time down here.
I don't know about you guys, but I am having a great time.
Oh, and that pizza guy says he'll have the baby delivered in under 30 minutes.
Which gives me plenty of time to check up on those parochial girls.
I told them my uncle was the Pope.
Well, I guess some people can have a good time anywhere.
So, Eric, if you just want to sulk and feel sorry for yourself, be my guest, OK?
But I'm gonna make the best of it, 'cause I'm here with my friends, and that's what's important.
Yep, fine.
You do that, all right?
I'm gonna use all my brainpower to will this train to move.
Ah, phooey!
I need a bigger brain.
Timmy!
Come over here.
I don't get John either, 'cause I loved Thelma and Louise, OK?
Could he be more perfect?
- Stop.
Stop.
- I know, I know.
I mean, really.
- Hey, Johnny.
Where you goin', man?
- Oh, I don't know.
I'm thinkin' the roof.
Well, remember, tuck and roll.
Hey, Eli.
I hate your guts.
The man is obviously not a people person.
Lynn.
Jonathan, I, um I just need some closure on our relationship.
Relationship?
We only went out once.
Why are you being so hostile?
I just need to be with someone who will listen to me!
- Hey, Eli!
- Yeah?
Come in, come in.
Incoming!
OK!
All aboard the party car.
We've got refreshments by the conductor's booth, we've got dancing right here, and if you guys want a quite place to chat, there is plenty of room down by the sad guy.
Hey, man, you know, I thought tonight was gonna be a wash.
But you pulled it together and turned it into a paartay.
- What?
- A party.
- Oh, cool.
Thanks.
- Hey, you're all right.
Hey, everybody!
Listen up.
How about we give it up for the man who put together this little underground paartay?
What?
- Party.
- Oh.
Yeah!
What was that for?
It's not even midnight.
I know.
But they're passing out garlic balls, and I wanted to get a fresh kiss in.
Can I get one of those?
- A lot of garlic.
- Yeah, like I got somebody to kiss.
- Look, Eric, I said I was sorry.
- No, no.
Look, I'm over Rebecca-Alexa.
You know why?
'Cause I dumped her.
I can do better than her.
You know what else?
I don't even believe me.
Thank you.
Uh You know, Eric, I was thinking.
I mean everyone always makes such a big deal out of New Year's, right?
But why?
I mean, they never turn out the way you planned.
- Yeah, you're not kiddin'.
- Yeah, especially for us.
Uh, you remember that night where we tried to make popcorn in the radiator?
How could I forget?
I mean, Mom and Dad freaked out on us, and the walls popped for weeks.
How about that year we let the blonde baby-sitter curl your hair?
Oh, yeah.
I remember that.
- When's that going away?
- I don't know.
It's Yeah, we had a lot of lousy New Year's together.
Yeah, we sure did.
They were all pretty good.
Especially this one.
I mean, big party, lot of people dancing, having a good time.
Thanks, man.
OK, everybody!
Listen up, listen up!
The New Year is coming in!
Five four three, two, one!
Hey!
Hey, hey!
Hey, good news, everybody!
- Twins!
- Mrs. Ginelli had twins?
No.
But I do.
This is Linda, and her sister, More-Linda.
Happy New Year's, Cor.
Happy New Year's, Eric.
Eric, as much as I'm liking this brother-brother moment, I - Yeah, go kiss your girlfriend.
Go.
- Thank you.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Quiche?
Don't mind if I do.
Amy, Alan Oh, this is so embarrassing.
Do you have any money?
Well, George Hamilton Feeny!
Great tan!
Yes, yes.
Well, it was a wonderful trip.
But the cab is waiting, and all I have is Bahamian cash, and airline peanuts.
Oh, I'm sorry, George.
I didn't get to the bank today.
Hey!
I got a dollar.
Dig deeper, man.
The meter's running.
Well, why don't you have the guy take you to a bank machine?
I don't want to spend another minute with this driver.
He looks nothing like his picture.
I'll be right there, Vajneesh!
Hey, Mr. Feeny.
How was your trip?
Hey, maybe the boys can loan you some money.
Oh A little short again George?
I'd rather risk my liver.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
You know the best thing about studying at your house?
- The good lighting in the bathroom?
- No Feeny.
Morning.
That is really not fair.
Shawn, you're closer to the door.
Let him in.
Why?
So he can hassle me?
No.
That door is doing exactly what it's supposed to.
Hey.
I know Feeny, all right?
The man is a pro.
Now, he leaves that principal stuff at school.
Ready for the test, gentlemen?
- Again, not fair.
- We're studying, Mr. Feeny.
See?
My history book is right here.
- Still in its original cellophane, I see.
- Uh-huh.
- I get top dollar on the resale.
- You know, Mr. Hunter, I've noticed that the students who do best in my class have usually read the book.
- Yeah, what's that get 'em?
- Into college.
More books.
George.
Are the boys in trouble?
Probably.
But that's not why I'm here.
You remembered it's my birthday this Sunday.
That is so sweet.
Oh, morning, George.
Are the boys in trouble?
- George remembered it's my birthday.
- Oh, you got a birthday coming up?
I'm kidding.
It's Sunday.
How could I forget?
The Eagles are playing.
Not for you, honey.
- A key?
- To my cottage in the mountains.
I thought you two might enjoy a romantic getaway this weekend.
Oh, George, you are the best.
Thank you.
Wait a minute.
I thought you sold your place in the Poconos.
I intend to.
I don't get up there very much.
But I assure you, it's very romantic.
Well, that's very considerate, George.
But, see, I already have plans for her birthday.
Well, hang onto the key.
Another weekend, perhaps.
Oh, whoops!
My history book just slipped.
I better go try and find it.
Cory, I believe you know the terrain best?
Um, yes.
I know this tundra like my own backyard.
Cory, I have got something incredible to tell you.
But for security reasons, I am going to use our code.
Well, we don't have a code, so you Really?
Guys like us should have a code.
Well, you know, we'll bring that up at the next meeting, but just, you know - When's our next meeting?
- Shawn, we don't have meetings.
This club blows.
Look, I think I know how to make it better.
- It's Feeny's key.
So what?
- So?
There is an empty cottage in ski country, which means a mountain full of young, healthy, snuggly snow bunnies.
Feeny's house.
You know if we went up there, he'd go mental.
A bonus.
Look, this guy goes out of his way to make my life miserable.
- Here's his way of making it up to me.
- Shawn, it's not right.
Cor, sometimes you gotta break the rules.
Look, it's deceitful and irresponsible, OK?
Plus the chances of getting away with it are slim to none.
Oh, you know I'm going.
- Two bus tickets to paradise.
- And the weather report?
Fresh blanket of snow on the mountains.
All right, Shawn.
Not to put a damper on our plans or anything, but, you know, it occurred to me in a moment of clarity that we don't ski.
Hey.
We don't learn, but we go to school, don't we?
- Uh, Mr. Turner?
Mr. Turner?
Could I - Yeah, what is it?
Oh, it's me.
Eric?
I'm Cory's brother.
- Yeah.
You're in my English lit class.
- Oh, right.
How am I doing?
- Not so great.
- Cool.
Um, anyway I saw you over there talking to Bianca Sabatini.
- Uh-huh?
- Yeah?
Well, I was just wondering, how do you know her?
- I'm her teacher.
- Could you teach her to go out with me?
'Cause, see, I know she only goes out with jocks.
I'm not really into sports, man.
Don't get me wrong, I see the occasional game, but just to see the player's wives.
They get the best-looking girls, you know.
It's got something to do with the cars, or Matthews, Matthews.
This conversation doesn't really need me, does it?
Um, no.
Not really.
But thanks for your time.
- No problem.
- OK.
See you.
Um, hi, Bianca.
I'm Eric Matthews.
We're in the same English class.
- Oh, yeah.
You're the smart one.
- Yeah.
That's right.
This year I might be class Victorian.
You're cute.
Are you a jock?
I've worn them.
So what is it with you and jocks, anyway?
I like to date winners.
So what sport do you play?
- Do you follow pool?
- Not at all.
I'm a grand master.
You know, that's funny.
I never thought of pool as a jocky kind of sport.
Really?
Do you see this scar?
Eightball championships, Mexico City, 1964.
Excuse me.
If it isn't Mr. and Mrs. Buttinski playing on the table that me and Frankie were most joyously playing upon.
Uh, whatever, guys.
Well, the table was empty, so if you don't mind, we'd just like to finish up here.
What?
Are you challenging Frankie to the table?
- I said that?
- Well, you implied it.
Come on, Eric.
I'd love to see the grand master at work.
It'd make me very happy.
OK, Frankie.
You're on.
I mean, how good could he be, right?
You're buried, Matthews.
Dead.
In the ground.
Well, here you go.
- 'Hank 'oo.
- 'Hank 'oo 'hery 'huch.
Little chilly for you city boys.
'Ittle bit.
Uh, thanks for the ride, Officer, uh Ranger.
Ranger Mark.
How old are you?
Which one of you is Feeny's grandson?
- Oh, he is.
- Oh, he is.
- Well, I am.
- We both are.
- We're brothers.
- We're cousins.
Brother-cousins.
No need to explain, son.
I'm from mountain people myself.
So, Ranger Mark, how far is the nearest ski lodge from here?
Oh, about two miles.
Manageable.
And how far if you're walking?
Two miles.
- Two miles?
- Hey, lighten up, Cor.
It's only a mile each.
You boys be sure to keep your windows and doors secured at night.
You wouldn't want to wake up in the morning with a skull full of Grady's ax.
Grady's ax?
Legend has it that years ago, a man brought his beautiful bride to Grady Pines.
And she fell in love with a young ski instructor.
The husband went crazy with jealousy, and hacked them both up, before taking his own life.
Now, the locals will tell you, every year that psycho returns to this mountain to wreak his bloody revenge.
Uh, I got a question.
If the psycho took his own life, then how can he come back?
Huh.
That's why you don't see many rangers on The Tonight Show.
Anyway, do you boys know how to turn on the electricity?
Oh, please.
I think we know how to flip a switch.
Well, good.
I gotta go.
I'm watching a video with my buddy Moose.
That's another ranger friend of yours?
A moose can't be a ranger.
Do you believe that?
Turn on the electricity.
Oh, I know.
What kind of city mama's boys does he take us for?
This is it Eric!
Yeah, see, in Mexico they have chicken wire around the table.
- What's the crowd for?
- Big game, Mr. Williams.
Come on, concentrate, Frankie.
Like you do at Thanksgiving.
- First night or the second night?
- There's only one night.
Not at my house.
Yes!
No!
- Matthews.
- Mm?
- How long you guys been playing?
- About an hour.
So let me ask you something.
Why are all the balls still on the table?
Been having some bad luck.
- Some serious bad luck.
- Uh-huh.
Well, that was the worst two hours of my life.
I can't believe the ski lodge was closed.
Yeah, you think Ranger Mark might have mentioned the little fact that there's no one else on the mountain.
There wasn't even any snow.
Yeah, what about that, Shawn?
You told me the weather report said snow in the mountains.
They did.
They said the Rocky Mountains were blanketed with fresh powder.
The Rockies.
Shawn, we're in the Poconos.
from the Rocky Mountains.
Oh, you mean that's a name?
I thought it was a description.
You know, like, "chewy nougat.
" That's great, Shawn.
No power, no lights, no heat.
What are we gonna do?
OK, OK.
Lemme think, lemme think.
Cory, either the lights just went on, or I got an idea.
- Somebody's here.
Shh, shh, shh.
- Who?
With our luck, a dead psycho ax-murderer.
You mean Grady?
No, I'm thinking Pooh Bear.
Of course, Grady.
OK, you dead psycho ax-murderer.
Let's see what you're made of.
All right, I'm here.
Time to belly up to the excuse table.
Mr. Feeny, you've got no right trespassing on your own property.
Mr. Matthews, you're up.
Actually, Mr. Feeny, my parents are on their way up, and we just rushed ahead to straighten up the place.
That's a bald-faced lie.
Every word, sir.
So, you two snaked the key from your parents and snuck up here to have a good time.
That's a bald-faced lie, Mr. Feeny.
It worked when he said it.
You know, Mr. Feeny, I thought you said you never used this place any more.
- I came to pack up so I could sell it.
- We'll take it.
Hey, now you're trespassing.
I don't even hear you anymore.
Look, Mr. Feeny, before things get too out of hand, why don't you just call our parents and they can come pick us up?
This late?
Uh-uh.
No, we're stuck here till morning, like it or not.
- How many beds are there?
- One.
I'll flip you for it.
Call it in the air.
You lose.
Why is everybody cheering?
Well, 'cause nobody's ever seen folks hold a table for three hours without sinking a single shot.
So, how's it feel to be dating a winner?
I'll let you know as soon as I find one.
So you'll call me then?
She was too good for you, Matthews.
Yeah, you know something?
You're right.
She was just holding me back.
I know I feel a lot less pressure.
All right, Frankie.
Let's play some pool.
I saw that coming.
No, really.
I did.
Time me, Cor.
Uh, Mr. Feeny, can I borrow your watch?
No.
- What is he doing, anyway?
- He's trying to beat his previous record.
Seven and a half hours.
Mr. Hunter, have you ever considered what seven and a half hours of schoolwork would do for your history grades?
Mr. Feeny, the spoon trick brings pleasure to others.
Do you enjoy doing that?
Yeah.
Why?
What do you do up here for fun?
I read books.
Care to join me?
Oh, right.
And if you jumped off a bridge, I'm supposed to do that, too?
Here, go for the gold.
- Man, what is his problem?
- Shawn, I think it's your problem.
What are you talking about?
He's the one that hates me.
No, he doesn't, all right?
Feeny's not a bad guy.
I mean, you know the British.
A little stiff, but once you get beneath the surface There's still more Feeny.
Cory, a guy like him is never gonna understand a guy like me.
- We are complete opposites.
- You should give him a chance.
OK.
I'll give him a chance.
Mr. Feeny.
Why do you hate me so much?
I beg your pardon?
I want to know why you hate me so much.
Is that what you think?
Yeah.
I mean, you're always getting on my case.
Well, if by that you mean I'm always trying to get the best out of you, then, yes, I'm always on your case.
But - I certainly don't hate you.
- You see, Shawn?
It frustrates me to see such a charismatic young man, with so much unfulfilled potential.
Yeah, I got you.
So I'm just another one of your hopeless students.
And I suppose I'm just another stodgy old principal.
The stodgiest.
What do you know about me, Mr. Hunter?
Oh, like you know anything about me.
Well, let's see.
Shawn Patrick Hunter.
Son of Chet and Virna, born in Ohio, lived in Oklahoma.
In and out of five schools before he was 12.
You memorized my transcript.
Oh, and you love a musical group named Counting Crows.
That's not in my transcript.
Do you know that much about all your students?
No, I don't.
Well.
Maybe you could give me a hand with these dishes?
Well, if you know everything about me, you must know I hate doing dishes.
Ho ho, good try.
Come on.
So, Mr. Feeny.
Tell us something about you.
Well, those closest to me would say that I also dislike doing dishes.
So, gentlemen, I give you the sink.
- Oh, look out.
My watch.
- Oh, no problem, Mr. Feeny.
Got it, got it.
Had it.
Um, sorry.
Well Well, it's nothing but a 30-year-old watch.
About time I got another one, I suppose.
- What are you doing?
- I'm reading.
No, really.
This book Feeny was looking at.
It's some kind of diary.
Shawn, you're reading Feeny's diary?
Are you crazy?
Are you nuts?
Are we in it?
He just knew so much about me, I wanted to find out some stuff about him.
Do you know he used to come up here with his wife?
- Yeah, I knew that.
- Man, I didn't even know he was married.
Listen to this.
"December 18, 1961".
"I called in sick so Lillian and I can sneak up here for a three-day weekend.
" Hah!
Feeny cut class.
"I suppose my students will miss me, but every now and then you have to break the rules.
" - Sounds like you, Shawn.
- It's more like me than you think.
December 19, the next day.
"Lillian and I never made it out to the slopes.
No regrets.
" Feeny, you dog.
Let's see here.
"February 14, 1965.
Lillian and my fifth anniversary.
" "Still no sign of the slopes.
" "In the evening we exchanged gifts.
As I lifted the wristwatch out of its box, the glass on the watch face caught Lillian's reflection.
" "A smile that lit the night sky.
" His wristwatch.
"That watch will keep time but for a moment in time.
" "But her smile will reflect in its face forever.
" Oh, morning, Mr. Feeny.
Everything's fine.
I just need a flashlight, a rope, and maybe a wet suit.
- Wet suit?
- Cory!
Can't talk now, Shawn's in over his head.
Hey, Mr. Feeny.
Oh, my God.
You're dripping on the rug.
And you reek.
Sorry, but your septic tank's a lot deeper than it looks.
All right, that does it.
I've tried to be patient, but this nonsense has gone far enough.
- Look, Mr. Feeny, before you get mad - I'm already mad.
Now, I don't want to hear a word out of the two of you until we get back into the city.
Mr. Feeny, we My watch?
Hope it still works.
Never thought I'd see this again.
We, uh We figured it meant a lot to you.
Being your anniversary watch and all.
You read a book, Mr. Hunter?
Guess I did.
Well, good for you.
I want to thank you both.
Well, now, before we get into the car, why don't you two take a dip in the lake and get cleaned up?
- But it's like 20 degrees out there.
- We'll freeze.
Take a sweater.
What the heck were you two thinking?
Look, you lied, you trespassed, and you endangered yourselves.
You are in it a lot deeper than you were in that septic tank.
George, I am very sorry.
Yeah, but believe me, the punishment will fit the crime.
Well, fine.
But bear in mind, their behavior was wrong, but their spirit is right.
They're two good guys.
Pulling for you.
Oh, uh, Mr. Feeny?
Your key.
Thought you might need it when you sell the place.
If I sell it.
Oh, and this is yours, too.
Guys, we're not finished with you yet.
Gentlemen, a word of advice.
Don't talk.
Nod a lot.
I still don't get it.
- Ahh!
- Hey.
Urgh.
- What?
Is it my shot?
- Ah, come on, Matthews.
It's over.
You guys have been playing for 15 straight hours and you have yet to sink a ball.
Besides, I gotta get to church.
- Choir practice.
Alto, you know.
- He sings like an angel.
Oh, oh, oh, come on.
I know what this is.
You guys are chickening out now that I got you right where I want you.
Ah, come on, Matthews.
You couldn't hit the broadside of a barn if it came up to you and said, "Hey, I'm the broadside of a barn.
Hit me.
" La la la la la la la All right, fine.
Go, you half-milers.
Just like Mexico.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Oh, Trevor.
- Take me with you.
- Take her, Trevor.
Take her.
No.
No, he can't.
No.
No, I can't.
The world of the submarine is far too dangerous for a woman.
I don't care.
I don't have to be alive to love you.
Oh, that's that's beautiful.
See, Cory?
Wasn't that a good movie?
Cory!
You're drooling.
No.
No, I-I-I was crying.
Through my mouth.
If you're bored, why don't you go upstairs and watch the game with your father?
Oh, hon, anyone can watch the Super Bowl, right?
I mean, it takes a special man to watch a classic like this.
Is that what you are, Cor?
A special man?
Huh?
- Eric.
What are you doing?
- I'm saving a life.
Listen to me.
You and Topanga spent the last three Friday nights at home, tearing up at chick flicks.
Excuse me, last Friday night, if you recall, Topanga and I spent a lovely evening at home, watching no TV whatsoever.
You made jam!
It was preserves, Eric.
It was preserves.
It was a nifty little recipe in this Couples magazine, see?
I told them I was married to get a subscription discount.
Are you blind in the eyes, man?
Huh?
You and Topanga are turning into an old, boring couple.
Eric, Topanga and I have been going out for five months, all right?
And in our circle, we are considered young and hip.
Hon, how are the muffins doing?
- I'll stick a fork in 'em, hon.
- Hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
If you go near that oven, I'll stick a fork in you.
- You wouldn't.
- Oh, I'd be doing you a favor.
Oh, stop being such a wisenheimer.
Who said that?
You did, Pops.
Shawn, there you are.
Quick, tell me about your weekend.
- A lot of dates, I bet.
Huh?
- Who counts?
Six.
I want you to tell me about them.
Every single one.
Tell me like your life depended on it.
Cory, I'm no rocket scientologist, but, uh I'm sensing there's something wrong.
What makes you think something's wrong?
Does my life have to be in a horrible boring rut to ask you how your weekend was?
Come on!
Throw a bone to your buddy.
No.
You doubled with your folks again.
Only on Friday and Saturday.
But Sunday, it was just me and Topanga at the mall.
Yep.
She bought me slacks.
Oh, Cory.
I think you have a problem.
Yeah, I think so too.
But you, my friend, are in luck, 'cause come on.
What am I the world's biggest expert on?
Really, not anything.
OK.
OK, but I do know a lot about love.
And it sounds to me like you and Topanga are in a slump.
No, no.
We're terrific, Shawn.
It's just It's me.
I've lost my edge.
I'm not the same old dangerous Cory.
Yeah, there's been talk.
- Really?
- No.
Look Here's your answer.
OK.
I got a special invite tonight to a dance at Hamilton High.
Why don't you come with me?
Wear your new slacks.
Really, a party at another school You know, this could be just what I need.
Wait.
Wait, I have plans with Topanga tonight.
Change 'em.
Tell her you need a night out with the boys.
Come on, there she is now.
Why don't you go talk to her?
OK, I will.
But this is not gonna be easy.
The key is to be direct and vague, yet obvious, and subtle.
Most important, I must stick to my guns no matter what she throws at me.
Hi, Cory.
I can't go.
Cory, about tonight Can we reschedule?
Some of the girls are getting together, - and if it's all right with you - Oh, don't speak.
Don't speak.
If you need to get together with the girls of your gender, I completely understand.
Cory, have you been reading Couples magazine?
- I took the quiz in the back.
95.
- Ooh.
Yo, Matthews.
Wait up.
Uh, your paper on Of Mice and Men, I got some serious questions about it.
Like, uh where is it?
Well, I can't find the book anywhere.
I've been to every pet store in the city.
I did find this pamphlet on land turtles.
I'll do you a favor.
I'll lend you my copy.
Hey, here's your pamphlet.
Matthews, how's your journalism project going?
In what?
Journalism.
You're supposed to analyze the evening news.
Oh, that's right.
I did.
Here, walk with me.
Let's talk.
- You want a paper too, don't you?
- Yes.
Oh, Mr. Matthews.
- Very interesting essay on Joan of Arc.
- Ah.
Finally, a little appreciation.
Now, did that hurt?
I doubt if "Arc" meant that Joan was from Arkansas.
- It's a theory.
- It's an F. Why can't you guys just cut me some slack?
Matthews, I'll cut you some slack.
Don't bother showing up to chemistry anymore.
Just blow up something at home and bring it in.
Thank you, Dr. Sorrell.
You are a man among men.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have Sarah-mix.
Wait, you mean ceramics?
Yeah, the ashtray class.
- You know what scares me?
- What?
He'll end up making more money than any of us.
Mom, hold my calls.
Tonight I'm gonna be studying.
Great.
Let me get my camera.
Hey, I'm serious.
I mean, I got pencils, I got notebook, I got refreshment.
I got everything I need to be a studying fool.
Where are your books?
- Eric, did you leave them in your locker?
- Yeah.
Either there or on the bus.
Oh, Eric.
You don't take the bus.
Well, then, they're safely in my locker.
What would I do without you, Mom?
You'd study the kitchen table.
Shawn, I need you to help me pick out something for the party.
- Sure.
- OK.
- What do you think of this shirt?
- It's fine.
Yeah?
But do you like it better than this?
They're both great.
Everything you got here's fine.
I mean, they're all very you.
That's the problem, Shawn.
Everything I own is me.
I mean, everything about me is me.
And me right now just ain't cutting the Dijon.
Cory, maybe it's not you.
Are you sure everything's cool between you and Topanga?
Oh, yeah.
I love her.
She's the best.
It's not Topanga.
It's me.
You know what my problem is?
I don't know what my problem is.
Come on, Cory.
Let's just go to this party, OK?
Come on.
Yeah, but dressed like this?
No way.
So wear something of mine.
What do you want?
A jacket?
A hat?
A jacket.
I'm very prone to hat head.
Sometimes I get it without even wearing a hat.
No, no, Williams, I'm telling you, I've been at this game a lot longer than you have.
You can't just show up and change the rules.
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
I thought this was supposed to be a friendly little faculty meeting.
- You cannot check and raise, man.
- He's right.
Matthews, what are you doing here?
So this is what happens at faculty meetings?
Just on Mondays.
This is our weekly game.
We don't play for money.
We talk, we relax, we try to forget there's such a thing as students.
You don't play for money?
Even you, Dr. Sorrell?
No need to.
With finals around the corner, I'm sure to have fresh cash rolling in.
- Can I join you?
- No!
Oh, what?
Are we afraid of a little competition?
Terrified.
Now go.
All right, look.
Let me make a deal with you guys.
Let me just play until I lose, and then I'll go home and study.
Now, as teachers, how do you argue with that?
- He needs the grades.
Deal him in.
- Oh, come on.
Hi, I need to see your Hamilton High ID card.
- We go to John Adams.
- Yeah, but it should be on the guestlist.
- What's the name?
- It's under Hunter.
Shawn Hunter.
Oh, wow.
Shawn Hunter.
- That's right.
- We heard you were coming.
Go right on in.
Your guest too.
I'm Hilary.
You know, I won't be stuck at the door all night.
Save me a dance, Shawn?
You bet he will.
Right, Shawn?
Wait.
No, you - Shawn, that girl thinks I'm you.
- So?
So we gotta set her straight, or else word's gonna spread that I'm Shawn Hunter.
Again, so?
Well, if people think I'm you, they - Wow.
- Let's go, Shawn.
OK.
Now, as far as anybody at this party knows, you are Shawn Hunter.
Look, one girl at the door thought I was you, OK?
That was it, Shawn.
Just one girl.
Hi, Shawn.
Uh, hi.
- Somebody's talking to you.
- Oh.
Hi, pretty girl.
Only Shawn Hunter can pull off a line like that.
Yeah, so, how did it feel, Shawn?
Well, on one hand, I'm a little flushed, but on the other hand, I notice a little kick in my step.
You know, there's something very exciting about being you.
And now you understand my Monday- morning smile.
But tonight, it's all yours.
Tomorrow you can go back to being your everyday, lackluster, boring I get it.
I get it.
Now, why don't you go check out those little ladies over there?
Or, as I might say, babes.
You're about to experience all that is Shawn.
Hey!
- Who are you doing?
- You!
No, no, no.
That wasn't me, that was Fonzie.
- Huh.
This is trickier than I thought.
- Oh, Cory, you're trying too hard.
Just relax, and be myself.
- So what are you saying?
- Don't do anything.
So you're telling me the key to being Shawn Hunter is doing nothing?
That just by sitting on this table with my arm folded, girls are gonna suddenly come over and ask me to dance?
Shawn.
Let's dance.
Hey.
Well, now, I have three aces.
Beat that, Mr. Matthews.
Darn.
I only have two jacks and a ten.
And another jack.
And another ten.
I win again.
All right, Matthews.
I know you're cheating, I just can't figure out how.
You know something, Mr. Williams?
Your words have soiled me.
Why can't you guys believe that maybe Eric Matthews is good at something?
Get off your high horse, Matthews.
We all know you're cheating.
And when I find out how, we'll talk.
Gentlemen, please.
Ante.
The sooner he loses, the sooner he studies at home, away from us.
OK, remember, girls, that is now our song.
- So how are you doing, Shawn?
- Well, the reviews are in.
We are a hit!
I know.
I saw.
Three girls at once?
No, Shawn, it's not just the girls.
It's the way I'm feeling tonight.
Not knowing what's gonna happen from moment to moment.
It is so exciting.
- Thanks for letting me be you, buddy.
- You're not being me, you're being you.
Yeah, but everyone here thinks I'm Shawn Hunter.
Sure, but you're not doing anything Cory Matthews wouldn't.
Well, whoever I am is having a pretty good time.
And it's about to get better.
Word is there's a very hot French girl here who comes from someplace in Europe.
- Possibly France?
- Yeah, France.
The gateway to St. Louis.
So fill me in.
Who is she?
What's she doing here?
- I haven't talked to her yet.
- But Shawn, that's so unlike you.
I am not Shawn tonight.
You are.
So go find her.
No, no.
That would be wrong.
I mean, I got Topanga.
I feel weird enough being at this party without her.
Come on.
All you're gonna do is talk to her.
Well, what do we talk about?
Cheese.
They love it.
Then cheese it is.
Jack high, I win.
This could be the least amount of fun I've ever had in my life.
All right, Matthews.
I'm not saying you're cheating.
I'm thinking it really hard, but I'm not saying it.
I just need to know, for my own peace of mind Stop with the pleasantries.
As principal of John Adams High, I demand to know how you're doing this.
You're not the principal.
You just keep thinking that, George.
Hey, now.
Wait a second.
I'm not doing anything wrong.
Oh, pick those up, Matthews.
Sure, there's only 238 pretzel sticks.
- What did you say?
- With, you know, 4,572 grains of salt.
The man's a counter.
So, what?
Is this like Rain Man?
Or what?
Yeah.
Yeah, de-definitely good movie.
Def-definitely good movie.
All right.
That's it.
Game over.
- Oh, but come on.
This is so much fun.
- Oh, yeah.
- Well, the fun doesn't have to stop, Eric.
- What do you mean?
Now, as it happens, I'm taking my favorite students to what I like to call a science fair this weekend in Atlantic City.
We'll be researching probabilities, statistics, and maybe a little keno.
- I don't think so, Mr. Sorrell.
- It's Dr. Sorrell.
Oh, give it up, man.
You're not a doctor.
Am too.
Listen, I've had it with you, Sorrell.
Now, I won't have a member of my faculty behaving like this.
Not a problem.
I quit.
So, Matthews, you in?
Hey.
Did you find the French girl yet?
No, but I am having the best time looking.
Adventure, the thrill of the hunt Not to be repeated, but this sure beats shopping for slacks.
You wild man.
Why are the guys all over that French girl?
It's just a stupid foreign accent.
She's right there, Cor.
You go over there, who knows what could happen.
You're right, Shawn.
I mean, there is no turning back now.
Or as the French say, Viva Las Vegas.
Wow.
So Elvis was French.
Would you like to dance?
Ah, oui.
You're the French girl?
- I'm talking to you.
- And she doesn't speak English, pal.
Now back off.
- No, you back off.
Now.
- Cory.
Don't make a scene.
Whoa!
I just understood French.
Hey, Gordo.
Guess who speaks French.
Do you want to explain to me what you're doing here?
And in English, please?
Me and my girlfriends thought it would be fun to come to another school's party.
- Yeah, and pretend to be other people?
- Well, what's wrong with that?
Well, what's wrong with being you, Topanga?
Nothing.
But being French I don't know.
It seemed exciting.
Yeah, well, it takes a pretty insecure person to pretend to be other people.
Hi, Shawn.
I've been looking for you.
Shawn?
You know, I didn't come here to be Shawn.
I mean, who'd wanna be Shawn when they can be me?
Just be you.
And can you tell me, why did you come here?
I don't know.
I mean, I came here because I needed a change, you know?
I mean, it was either coming here or buying another pair of slacks.
You came here because you wanted to have some fun.
Well, you know, we haven't had fun in a long time, Topanga.
I know.
How long's it been?
How long have we been married now?
What, 40, 50 years?
- We're in a rut.
- A big rut.
A rut filled with Couple magazines and slacks and jams.
You know, when you and I started going out, everything was so exciting for me, you know?
I mean, like, every day was something different.
There's just no mystery anymore.
Yeah.
And I see Eric and Shawn going on their dates, you know, so psyched, wondering what's gonna happen.
We've forgotten what that feels like.
Yeah.
And then, you know, I ask myself how I feel about you, and..
I feel like I still care about you as much as I always have.
You know, and that'll never change.
Are we breaking up?
I don't wanna break up.
Because when people break up, they always end up hating each other.
Well, we're not other people, Topanga.
Well, actually, we are, but but we could never hate each other.
No matter who we are, right?
- We are breaking up, aren't we?
- No!
No.
We're not.
We're never gonna break up.
Cory, maybe the people who end up hating each other are the people who waited too long to break up.
So are you saying you want to break up with me?
I'm saying I wanna keep caring about you as much as I care about you now.
Then we should break up right away so we can still stay great friends.
Which we've always been.
Yeah.
Yeah, and that'll never change, right?
Yeah.
- So I'll see ya.
- Yeah.
See ya.
Cory, maybe we're making a mis Topanga, I'm not sure this I want you to pay particular attention to the three headings and I want a comparative analysis of each one I bruise you You bruise me We both bruise Too easily Too easily To let it show I love you And that's all I know All my plans Have fallen through All my plans Depend on you Depend on you To help them grow I love you And that's all I know
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
All right.
I have enough information.
Look.
Mr. Feeny, we didn't do anything to provoke Frankie and Joey.
Thank you.
You may go.
- Like this?
- Yeah, how are we supposed to get home?
Wait till it's dark, then run very quickly.
- You think we're OK?
- Yeah, yeah.
Everyone's in class.
We couldn't have picked a better time.
That's bad.
Hey, Topanga, check out the new competition.
Pretty hot, huh?
Look at them, they must starve themselves.
I just get so nervous around such beauties.
No wonder I never made the squad.
Well, Cory, those Buns of Steel videos must have paid off.
I want to thank you both for coming down to discuss this matter.
Now, Mr. Stecchino.
- Yes.
- Yes.
- I was talking to Frankie.
- Yes.
I was talking to little Frankie.
I was talking to this lad right here.
Now.
Whose idea was it to burn students' clothes and make them dress up in cheerleaders' outfits?
I cannot say.
I must protect my friend, Joey the Rat.
Yes, well, it's too late.
Your friend, Mr. Epstein, has already been suspended.
This meeting is to try to save you from a similar fate.
Now, now, now, that won't happen to my boy, Mr. Feeny.
My boy, he's gonna straighten up and he's gonna fly right.
As an 11-time heavyweight champion of the world, I guarantee you, my boy, he's gonna toe the line.
Mr. Stecchino, I appreciate your passion, but you you don't have to bark.
Poor Joey.
Poor me.
What will I ever do without my best friend?
Someone who drags you down is not your best friend.
Now, I suggest you find a better crowd or you'll end up like your friend Joey.
You do what the man says.
You hear me?
- You don't have to yell.
- No, he's not yelling.
Well, again, thank you for dropping down.
Oh, and Mrs. Stecchino.
I'm so sorry.
- Ah, this sure feels better than those skirts.
- Well, I don't know, Shawn.
I mean, there's something to be said for the freedom that they gave.
Yeah, you thought that too?
- No, no.
- No, no.
Well, we better get out of here before Frankie comes looking for us.
Oh, not to worry, Shawn.
Mr. Feeny just read him the riot act, remember?
I mean, even Frankie wouldn't be stupid enough to mess with us after that, right?
Oh, you'd be pained at how stupid I could be.
You ratted on me and Joey.
And as Joey used to say: "Live by the rat, and die by the rat.
" - Well, what does that mean?
- Well, why don't we ask him?
Oh, wait, we cannot, for my one and only friend, Joey, has been suspended.
I walk alone in this world, except for the grilled cheese sandwich in my pocket.
- So who dies first?
- Whoa, whoa, Frankie.
You know, what I'm getting here, pal, is that friendship is very important to you.
So how about this?
You let us live, you got two new friends.
Who?
Us.
Think about it.
We could, you know, hang out, go to movies, ball games, whatever.
Poetry readings?
- Poetry readings, we're there.
- I hate poetry.
Shawn, if our friend who's gonna let us live likes poetry, then we like poetry.
Oh, poetry!
I thought you said "liver.
" So what do you say, Frankie?
Friends?
So this is a sincere effort and not just a phony move on your parts to avoid agonizing pain and suffering?
- Sincere.
- Absolutely heartfelt.
This makes me very happy.
Come here, friends.
Oh, gosh!
Nothing we ever do is right.
- You gonna get that?
- No.
Do you think it's her again?
Hi, it's me again.
And we have an answer.
John, I'm not saying you're avoiding me.
Maybe you're still at work, maybe you're out of town, or maybe you and Eli are standing there right in front of the phone and you're doing that thing with your hand covering your mouth.
She always did give me the willies, man.
Anyway, I'm in town until Sunday and I just think we owe it to each other to sit down and talk.
No pressure.
Bye.
Man gets a call, hey, lots of calls, from what sounds to be a very attractive lady.
Man doesn't speak a word of it to his little buddy, Shawn.
Hm.
Interesting.
Shawn, there's nothing to tell or I would've told you.
Man gets all squirrelly every time this girl calls.
Makes a guy think man's keeping secrets from him.
OK, Shawn, do you wanna stop with the whole "man" thing?
Man seems a little irritated lately.
It's no big deal.
It's a girl I dated a long time ago and it's over.
And don't you dare start the next sentence with "man.
" Dude's got a problem with the word "man.
" Shawn!
Come on, John, give him something.
OK.
OK.
All right, Shawn, you know those three little words that are very difficult to say to a woman unless you really mean them?
Is father home?
No, Shawn.
I love you.
Oh, you're just a little vulnerable right now.
Man needs to take a little walk.
- So who's this girl?
- You ever hear of the one that got away?
- That was her?
- Yeah.
Well, she left him, but I think John's the one that got away.
Away from what?
Well, you know everything about John, right?
Are you kidding me?
I live with the guy.
I'm his little buddy.
We have no secrets.
So you know that his parents are real rich?
He has parents?
You see, John was brought up in a big, old, stone house in Connecticut.
Private schools, trust funds, everything.
Now, all he had to do was stay in the family business, he'd have been set for the rest of his life.
Yeah, well, clearly he chose a different route.
Yeah, he did.
But before he chose this route, he had this girlfriend, see?
- The answering-machine girl.
- Melanie.
And Melanie's family grew up in a big old house too.
So everyone figured they'd get married and have rich little kids.
- So why didn't they?
- Well, Jonathan wanted his own life.
He didn't want his family's life.
Which caused disagreements between him and Melanie.
You understand?
So he gave up the good life and all that money to be a schoolteacher and teach kids like me.
What do you think of your roommate now?
That is one sad, twisted man.
I had a wonderful day at school today, Cory.
I think I'm gonna like being a regular guy and having regular friends like you.
That's really great, Frankie.
So, thanks for walking me home, OK?
You're welcome.
Hello, Mrs. Matthews.
Is it OK if Cory sleeps over at my house this Friday night?
Uh Sure.
Excuse me, Mom.
I got a question for you.
- Which part of didn't you understand?
- All right, Cory, what's going on?
Mom, it's Frankie.
I mean, it's suddenly like the guy's my new best friend.
I mean, he's not leaving me alone.
Well, maybe he's lonely.
Maybe he's just looking for people to hang with.
No, he doesn't need friends, I mean, he's Frankie the Enforcer.
Oh, Cory, everybody needs friends.
I'm sure that deep down inside he has some good qualities.
Why don't you try to find them?
No, Mom, he's a thug, all right?
I mean, he scares people.
He's made my life miserable since my first day at John Adams.
That sweet, polite boy?
Oh, yeah, Cory loves sleepovers.
You know, in fact, with Monday being a holiday, why don't you keep him all weekend?
- I could do that?
- You wouldn't be a friend if you didn't.
Right, little bro?
Whoa, John!
You've been doing some heavy cleaning today.
Oops.
That's your cologne.
- Oops, you've got noplace to live.
- So you did it, didn't you?
You called Melanie and we're all gonna move to a big house in Connecticut.
- You been talking to Eli, huh?
- A little bit.
Look, that's only who she thought I was, Shawn.
It's not who I am.
So why do you think she called you?
Because she wants to find out how I turned out.
How unhappy I am.
You know, how she made the right choice and I made the wrong one.
Get ready, Shawn.
You're about to meet Melanie Clifton, the richest girl in Westport, Connecticut.
She's gonna walk through that door, big old fur coat, jewelry, she's gonna take one look around this apartment, she's gonna criticize my lifestyle and then she's just gonna go on back to that big old house and all that money.
You just watch.
Would you be real upset if I went with her?
Hi, John.
It has been way too long.
Nice place.
You know, it kinda reminds me of mine.
- Hi, you must be Shawn.
- Hi, you must be money, M-Melanie.
- Cory.
Are you alone?
- No.
I tried to get away on my bike, but Frankie jogged behind me the entire way.
I mean, pound for pound, he is the fastest man on Earth.
Thank you, my friend.
I enjoyed our little workout.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I must replenish fluids.
Cory, the guy invited me to his house for a slumber party.
Oh, you're gonna be there too?
Yes, that's great!
You're not helping.
Look, my mom told me everyone has good qualities.
He doesn't have any good qualities.
He's a thug!
Well, now he's our thug, all right?
Let's just find the good.
What good?
Wherever he goes people scatter.
Look, look at this guy give him his burger.
From your humble servant.
It's turkey.
I hope that's not a problem.
Seventh graders just give up their table.
Yeah, they bow down to him like he's the king of the school.
- Cory.
- Yeah?
I think we have found the good.
Let us be sure.
If anyone needs me or Shawn, we'll be sitting right here with our new best friend, Frankie Stecchino.
Frankie, buddy!
- Where have you been all our lives?
- Around.
So, Melanie, this is a different look for you.
Jeans and a T-shirt, huh?
What happened?
Daddy cut off the credit cards, or what?
Actually, John, I have my own credit cards now.
I started my own little business.
So you just dress this way to make me feel comfortable?
No, I dress this way to make me feel comfortable.
This is what I wear to work.
I, um I started my own little bookstore.
What?
You don't work for your father anymore?
No, no, not for a few years now.
No.
So I guess you're not the only one who can change their life, huh?
Well, if I remember correctly, you weren't too happy with me when I changed my life.
Yeah.
I remember.
Actually, that's why I called.
Why, Mel?
Why did you call?
When you said that you were gonna become a schoolteacher, I was angry at you for throwing away your life.
Because I thought it was just so great being this little rich kid.
Well, it was, it was a good life, but, Mel, you gotta realize that eventually you have to find your own life.
Yeah, but I didn't want to.
And what made me really angry was that I knew that once you did it that someday I was gonna have to do it too.
And that scared me because I really loved my Beamer.
Yeah, those seats went all the way back, didn't they?
Yeah, John.
So anyway, I guess the reason I called was that I wanted you to know that I was trying.
And now that we know who we are, hopefully you can think of me differently.
- Do you still have the Beamer?
- Hey, a girl's gotta get around, you know?
Ah, the lunchtime rush and nowhere to sit.
What shall we do, Frankie?
Well, look.
A convenient opening.
Yeah.
See that, Frankie?
You hang with us, the seats just open.
I see it different.
You know, guys, I've been thinking about our friendship and it dawns on me, what kind of friends are we?
No, really.
Best friends.
Frankie, we value your friendship very much.
- Dry-cleaning.
- Dry-cleaning?
- They got the stain out.
- Oh, thank you.
Thank you, young man.
You're too kind.
- What's your name again?
- Robert.
No, not anymore.
From now on you are Dances With Sweaters.
I like it.
- Frankie, where are you going?
- I need to be alone and reflect.
What's the matter with him?
Mind if I sit with you guys?
Lost your way, Mr. Stecchino?
Metaphorically speaking, yes, Mr. Feeny.
You see, I found some new friends as you yourself suggested.
Yes, Mr. Hunter and Mr. Matthews.
Well done.
I'm not so sure.
Mr. Feeny, you told me hanging with a better crowd would make me a better person.
And yet here I wander, like the Israelites in the days of Yul Brynner.
You're over my head, Mr. Stecchino.
I'm still Frankie the Enforcer.
Ah.
So your new friends are not what you hoped they'd be.
It's always the same, Mr. Feeny.
Harley and Joey, Cory and Shawn, They just see this big guy who everybody's afraid of and they use my power for evil.
Why do you let them?
If pressed, Mr. Feeny, I would just have to admit I want them to like me.
- Is that so wrong?
- Everyone wants to be liked, Frankie.
Even you, Mr. Feeny?
Don't tell the students.
It would only create chaos.
When will they stop taking advantage of me?
As soon as you stand up to them.
Let them know how you feel.
I can do that?
That, Mr. Stecchino, is the test of a real friendship.
- But what if Cory and Shawn fail that test?
- Ah.
Welcome to my life.
Shawn, this is Frankie Stecchino.
I feel that you and Cory and me need to talk if we are really gonna be friends because it occurs to me that you don't know who it is I really am.
Please call me at your earliest convenience.
Please, Dad, I'm on the phone.
So she actually apologized for the way it ended?
Yeah, she did.
But I gotta tell you, man, we had a great time last night.
Yeah?
So when are we moving to Connecticut?
We're not, Shawn.
We're staying right here.
That's probably better, John.
All that money would only spoil me.
By the way, would a pillow be too much to ask for?
You know, what she was most sorry about is that she only knew me as this rich man's kid, you know.
She never really knew who I was or even tried to know.
You spent all that time together and you were never really friends.
Yeah, well.
I guess when you're young, first impressions are everything.
Sometimes you completely miss who someone really is, you know?
Cory.
What's going on?
Why did you want to meet me?
I didn't.
I got a message that you wanted to meet me.
What?
That makes no sense.
Makes a lot of sense to me.
Dances?
'Twas I who called you both.
We seventh graders aren't gonna take it anymore.
No more giving up our food.
No more doing your errands.
- What about my dry-cleaning?
- Finished.
Yeah?
Says you and what army?
My army.
We're kidding.
We love you guys.
Changing your tune?
Tune changers?
Robert, we can talk.
We can work this out.
Not so tough without your Enforcer, eh, boys?
Frankie!
Frankie?
Raid!
Wait, wait, wait, wait, guys!
Guys, wait.
What are you running from?
- Frankie The Enforcer.
- No.
No, that's only what you think of him as.
Shawn, what are you doing?
They're leaving.
Go on.
Leave.
Leave, go back to your lockers.
No.
No.
Cor, I've got something to say.
I mean, have any of you ever really looked at Frankie Stecchino?
Yeah, upside down.
No, I mean really looked at him.
I bet nobody here knows that this man has a very poetic soul.
Yeah, you know, he does.
- I mean, he goes to poetry readings.
- Yeah, that's right.
And believe me, deep down he's gentle.
Yeah, and you guys should forget about what you think he is, all right, and and just, I don't know, take a good look at him and give him a real chance.
Kinda like we should have.
Showing his teeth.
Run!
I'm sorry, man.
We tried.
All that stuff you said, did you mean it?
Or once again were you just trying to avoid an indescribable pain?
What do you think?
I think I want to grab a burger with my two new friends.
What do you think?
- Sounds good to me.
- Let's do it.
Yeah, we can get to know each other.
You know, Frankie, we're pretty lucky to have a friend like you.
Right back at you.
Yeah, I can't wait to see your dad work tonight.
So the match is at what time?
Vader time!
Papa, you don't have to be in character all the time.
Sorry, son.
I just I just get so worked up when I'm defending my belt.
And no one, I mean no one, is gonna take it from me.
And that includes you, little man!
Try it.
Go ahead.
Try it.
- I would never - Try it!
- It's too much metal for me, really.
- Come on!
I would never make it through airport security.
I'm sorry.
Cory!
Who's barking in the kitchen?
I am, little lady.
You got a problem with Vader?
Bring it on.
Oh, knock it off, Francis.
You know, you don't act this way at the PTA meetings.
So, Frankie.
Word around the halls is you've gone soft.
The Enforcer is no more, sir.
Eric, just leave him alone, all right?
After all he's done to me over the years, give me one good reason.
I'm gonna give you three.
Somebody get him a bone!
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
- That's great, Cor.
I'll see you later.
- See you.
- Cory, were you just talking to Topanga?
- Yeah.
Well, I was feeling a little chatty and, you know, even though we broke up, we're still friends.
She's your ex.
Let me spell that for you.
X!
Look, Shawn, Topanga and I aren't like other couples.
You're not a couple.
- I know.
- My point exactly.
- Then we agree.
- No!
I think we're saying the same thing.
Cory, I double-checked.
We have to be there at three for the Promwear Fashion Fest.
Fashion Fest?
Yeah.
This Saturday, Cory and I are modeling formalwear for the prom.
Isn't it great we can still do things together?
- Don't do that.
- I've always done that.
Shawn, are you crying?
I think I lost you, man.
I said I'd do this Fashion Fest thing when we were still going out.
- I mean, I can't bail on her.
- Yeah, you can.
You've got to move on.
Quit your crying.
I'm just a guy in a tux, walking down an aisle with his ex-girlfriend in a gown, in front of the entire school.
And you think I haven't moved on.
OK, Cor.
If you're really over her, then you're ready to date other girls.
Well, I should say so.
So you'd be up for a little double-date action?
Yes.
But what will you do, Shawn?
Oh, now this is the Cory I've always hoped for.
Hey, Katie, Melissa.
Do you guys want to go out with me and Cory tonight?
- Sure.
- That'd be great.
All right, Cor, we just got ourselves a double date.
What do you say?
You go.
OK.
"Penn State Office of Admissions.
" Oh, please, please, please, please.
Come on.
"Dear Eric Matthews, we have reviewed your application, and we are very pleased to announce " Oh!
Yes!
" we've had a record number of applicants.
" "Regretfully, there's not room for everybody.
" "Therefore we must reject your application " I'm sorry, Mr. Matthews.
Oh, hey!
Mr. Feeny, no.
Don't be sorry for me.
I'm not disappointed.
Actually, you wanna know why I came out here to read the letter?
It's not my business, Eric.
I know.
But my parents take these college rejections kinda hard.
I just wanna protect them.
Yeah, me?
I'm fine.
You get 30, 40 of these babies, it rolls right off your back.
Perhaps your parents could use a little pep talk?
- What would you tell them?
- Well, that no one likes rejection.
But, if you keep applying and keep trying, you and the right college will find each other.
Thanks, Mr. Feeny.
I mean, from my parents, 'cause they don't know what you've said yet.
- Cory, what are you doing?
- I'm enjoying a tasty lemon.
- Is there a reason?
- Yeah, we're out of mints.
Sucking citrus, eh?
Little Cory's got a date.
No, no.
It's not a date.
So, Cory, your dad says you're going on a date.
- It's not a date.
- Date.
The biggest.
You know, why can't you guys learn from Morgan?
She is a great sister.
I mean, she stays in her room, you don't hear from her, you don't see her, and, best of all, she stays out of my personal life.
So, rumor upstairs is you got a date.
Morgan, long time no see.
Yeah.
That was the longest time-out I've ever had.
So who's the unlucky girl?
Well, if you must know, her name is Melissa, OK?
- And we're just seeing a movie.
- With that thing on your nose?
- What thing?
- It's too easy.
Mom!
Come on, Morgan.
Let's go watch TV in the other room.
TV's not funny.
Cory's life is funny.
- Come on, Morgan.
- I just got here.
I have to leave again?
- Well, Cory has to talk with Eric.
- Yeah, sure.
Cory talks to Eric.
Cory talks to Shawn.
Cory talks to Mom and Dad.
When does Cory ever talk to Morgan?
- Are you here now?
- Yeah.
- Were you here before?
- No.
I was in my room for a real long time.
Be happy.
All right, look.
Your first date after a serious relationship can be kinda tough.
- It's not a date.
- It's not a date.
Yeah, I know.
Look I give you a lot of respect for getting back out there.
- Thanks, Eric.
Any advice?
- Yeah, look, it's a whole new world.
So whatever you do, don't mention your old girlfriend, 'cause I guarantee your date's not interested.
Now, listen.
This is the most important thing.
This is the one thing that could save you if you get in any trouble.
- Eric.
Jodie's on the phone.
- Gotta go.
Wait, Eric.
Eric, that last thing.
The saving thing.
It really wasn't that important.
Coming, Jodie.
That was such a great movie.
How was the one you guys saw?
Nice, but we missed you.
Well, hey.
I was just one theater over.
You know, that's the beauty of multiplexes.
And it's not like we're gonna do a lot of talking during the movie anyway, right?
Well, there are other things we could've done.
Could've, should've Let's not live in the past.
Are you guys gonna keep talking?
'Cause I can't hear myself kiss.
Phew!
Fresh air.
Excuse us for a minute.
Katie?
- Hi.
I'm on a date.
What are you on?
- A date.
No.
You're on the lecture circuit.
- A date is not a date until you kiss.
- That's just your opinion.
It's the reason we got out of the trees, man.
Now, look.
I'm doing this for your own good.
I don't want to have to put pressure on you, but you have got to kiss her.
- I know.
I know.
- By the end of the night.
And remember, you've got until the doorstep.
So, here we are at the doorstep.
Cory, you've said that three times already.
I just can't get over it.
I mean, a door, a step It's just a perfect word.
I mean, some words are so bogus.
"Window.
" What's that all about?
Kiss me.
Really?
Just like that?
Yeah.
Don't you want to?
Mr. Turner, Mr. Williams, Mr. Feeny.
They said it couldn't be done.
They said it was impossible.
- They said we're eating here.
- Yeah, wrong on all three counts.
- You gonna tell us?
Or just torment us?
- Both.
I hold here, in my hand, a letter of acceptance to college.
- Whose?
- Mine.
- All right, Matthews.
- Outstanding.
Congratulations, Eric.
Your parents must be relieved and very happy.
- Yeah, I sure am.
- So where are you going?
Boris.
- Boris?
- Yep.
Boris.
- Boris College?
- BC.
Forgive me, Mr. Matthews, but I'm not familiar with any Boris.
- May I see your letter?
- Oh, sure.
Hey, oh!
Can you wipe your hands first, Mr. Feeny?
This puppy's going up on the refrigerator, right under the magnetic sushi.
Once again, congratulations.
I'm sure Boris College will be very lucky to have you.
Oh, thank you, Mr. Feeny.
Hey, you know, thanks for always believing in me.
You know, when Boris plays Notre Dame you're gonna be sitting right next to me on the 50-yard line.
Hey, Kristen!
Guess who got into college!
Boris?
I'll take Notre Dame, by 60 points.
Hey, hey, hey, mi amigo.
All you did was shake her hand?
- How did you come up with that?
- It's written all over your unkissed face.
Shawn, I was gonna kiss her, all right?
I really wanted to.
I mean, my lips were primed.
My hand just got there first.
You're never gonna be over Topanga until you can kiss another girl.
- And I will.
- OK.
But it's not gonna be Melissa because, after last night, she is never gonna want to see you again.
Cory, I'd like to see you again.
- How about tonight?
- Sounds great.
You know, any other guy would've kissed me, but you didn't.
I like that.
Everything I've ever believed is wrong.
I I must try this what you call "handshake.
" Hi, Shawn.
Hi, Katie.
Can I - Can I shake your hand?
- Sure.
Cory, you're a genius.
Now, tonight, that was a flick, huh?
Well, it was nice being in the same theater with you.
Maybe next time we'll be in the same row.
Hey, I had to move.
I mean, you don't want to ask a guy to take his turban off.
So, it being our second date and all, it seems only natural that we should take the next step and Meet your parents.
Everybody decent?
You met her parents?
- How do you do that?
- No, bigger question.
How do you not kiss her?
Look, I was going to, Shawn, all right?
But every time I tried, all I could think about was Topanga.
You were right, though.
I mean, I'm not over her.
But she's not over me.
I mean, I know it, Topanga knows it, and the guy she's kissing knows it.
Why doesn't Topanga just rip my heart out and stomp on it?
She can't.
She's busy making out.
Maybe I'm dreaming.
Pinch me.
Not on the butt.
Sorry.
It was just right there.
All right, that's it.
I'm going in.
No!
Cory, Cory.
I'm not gonna let you make a fool of yourself.
But that guy's helping himself to my woman.
One, she's not your woman.
And two - Wow, he's fast.
- That's it.
I'm putting a stop to this.
- No!
That's it.
You're going home.
- But Shawn OK, watch out!
Watch your feet.
Hot soup.
Coming through.
Oh!
Ow!
Sorry, buddy.
It's not easy to hold a guy and work a lock.
Shawn, I don't know what you're doing.
I mean, as soon as you put me down, I'm going right back to Topanga.
Yeah?
And what are you gonna tell her?
I'm gonna tell her that if she keeps kissing guys like that, then then it's over!
Cory!
It is over!
Look, Topanga's doing exactly what she's supposed to.
She's met someone new, she's dating someone new, and now she's kissing someone new, just like you were gonna.
But I didn't, Shawn.
I don't want this.
- Well, Cory - I don't want this, Shawn.
What are you gonna do?
Something I should've done in the first place.
- Cory.
- Melissa.
I wasn't myself tonight.
And last night?
I mean, who was that?
But right now I know there are sparks between us.
- I know.
- I think we should see what we got here.
Oh, yes.
- Nothing.
- Oh, well.
See you in school.
My best to your folks.
I mean, as soon as I kissed Melissa, Shawn, I felt worse.
So there are no sparks between you and Melissa.
You did a good thing kissing another girl.
This way, when you see Topanga with another guy, you won't go bonkers.
Bonkers.
Hey!
Chicken fights, me and Nick.
Now I've lost him again.
Cory, hi.
Um So, do you know Nick?
Better than before.
So you must be the old boyfriend, right?
- Oh, so she's talked about me, huh?
- No.
Those are the only ones who ever jump on my back.
See you.
Cory, I know this is weird for you, but you can't be acting like this.
We're not together anymore.
Oh, so that means you can date anyone you want to?
- I'm not going to have this conversation.
- Fine.
Don't have this conversation.
I will.
- Cory, people are staring at us.
- Well, let them stare at us.
That didn't seem to bother you last night at Chubbie's.
- You were there?
- Yeah.
I mean, how do you think that made me feel?
Cory, I'm sorry you saw that.
But we both knew we were gonna see other people.
I know.
But You're not supposed to kiss anybody else.
Cory, I wish I knew what to say.
- Well, I gotta get to class.
- Well, I'm not done talking to you.
Well, I gotta go.
You know, when you were my girlfriend you would've been five minutes late.
Well, I'm not your girlfriend anymore.
Fine.
If that's the way you want it, I got a better idea.
Let's not be friends anymore either.
You don't mean that.
- Hey, Eric.
I heard your good news.
- Yeah, thanks.
Boris College.
I'm pretty stoked.
Maybe I should apply there.
I mean, we could hang out together.
Party.
Whoa!
Well, you know, I'm not sure Boris is much of a party school, but we could study together.
- That would be nice.
- All right.
George, I called the National Registry of Colleges.
- And?
- Just as you suspected.
They never heard of Boris College.
- I was hoping I was wrong.
- George, come "Boris"?
- I said "hoping.
" - You know, I've heard of these bogus scams.
They take 50 bucks from unsuspecting kids and then they mail them a diploma in whatever field they want.
- Somebody's gotta tell him.
- Yeah, I agree.
But who?
Oh, I know.
Why doesn't George do it?
- Mr. Matthews, I need a word with you.
- Oh, hey, Mr. Feeny.
If it's about that letter of recommendation I've been hounding you for, thanks, but I don't really need it.
After all, I am Boris-bound.
I have bad news.
You're not going to Boris College because, uh Well, actually, because Boris College doesn't exist.
Now, I know that's very disappointing for you to hear.
I kinda already knew.
You do?
Yeah, well, a couple of days after I got my acceptance letter, they mailed me a diploma.
And I'm no brain surgeon Actually, according to Boris, I am.
Well, if you knew, Eric, why did you go on pretending?
I don't know, Mr. Feeny.
I mean everybody's sitting around here talking about colleges, what schools they're going to, what courses they're gonna be taking and when I got that acceptance letter I felt like I was part of something.
That's what it's all about, isn't it, Mr. Feeny?
Letters.
I got the wrong letters on my report cards, I'm getting the wrong letters now.
I must say I'm very pleased that going to college means so much to you.
It's that very spirit that just may get you there.
- Yeah, I hope so.
- But, seriously, Eric.
Boris College?
Mr. Feeny, you think that's bad?
You see that girl over there?
She thinks she's going to some school called "Duke.
" Are you gonna tell her or should I?
"To Cory, Happy Valentine's Day 1991".
"Love always, Topanga.
" "Always" is pretty short these days.
"John Adams High School Prom Fashion Show.
This Saturday.
" Like that's gonna happen.
I love you beary much.
Yeah?
And I got a crush on you.
I love you bear Cory, what was that?
That was the sound of a relationship ending, Dad.
- Cory, didn't Topanga give you this?
- Yep.
I thought you two agreed to stay friends.
Yeah, so did I, Dad.
But Topanga didn't mean it.
I mean, two weeks after we break up she ends up kissing another guy.
And not just any guy, Dad.
Another guy.
I mean, I don't want this.
Look, I'm not saying you shouldn't be upset, but you have got to expect it.
Topanga is gonna go out with other guys.
And you're gonna go out with other girls.
You two are in high school.
You're supposed to date around.
- That's how you find the right person.
- I know.
But what if Topanga's my right person?
She might be.
And going out with other girls might help you find out for sure.
Your mom and I, we broke up, got back together, three or four Once.
Right, uh, once.
Before we got married.
And did you guys stay friends?
There were some rocky points, but we were always there for each other.
See, I think that's what brought us back together.
I mean, if you really care for each other you don't just throw away the most important bond you have - your friendship.
OK, guys.
We got a roomful of parents out there, all right?
I'm gonna need you lined up as couples.
- Topanga, I don't see Matthews.
- I don't think you will.
Hey.
Matthews wouldn't let you down.
That's what I thought.
Hi, everybody.
Welcome to the second, or third, or whatever, annual fashion thing.
I'm here because Mrs. Buckley is home, hacking up all kinds of good stuff.
Lucky her.
OK, so here we go!
If you see anything you like for your kids, there's order forms on the table.
If you have any questions, well, don't ask me 'cause this is the nicest thing I own.
Cory.
I'm sorry I'm late.
Come on, let's go.
Cory, wait.
There's something I want you to know.
The other day, when you said you didn't want to be my friend, you really hurt me.
Yeah, and I felt great when I saw you kissing that guy.
Cory, Nick has nothing to do with you.
Must you use his name?
Well, what do you want me to call him?
Sally!
- I want you to call him Sally.
- Cory, you're being crazy.
No, you're being crazy, OK?
Because you and I have known each other our entire lives, and it took us 14 years to kiss each other the way you kissed him.
- I didn't kiss him the way I ever kissed you.
- Oh, great.
I'm dancing now.
Cory, Nick is just a guy I'm going out with.
I don't care about him the way I cared about you.
I mean, we're only seeing other people because what else are we supposed to do?
I'm supposed to see other people.
You're supposed to wait till I die.
Cory, if it'll make you feel any better, the first time I see you kissing someone else I'll jump on her back.
- Really?
- Probably not.
But I'll sure feel like it.
- Topanga?
- Yeah?
That stuff I said before about us not being friends anymore?
Yeah?
I don't want that.
Yeah, fine.
Guys, come on.
I got some lady out there who wants to buy my clothes.
Cory, thanks for coming.
I'd never not be there for you.
- Morgan, what are you doing?
- Filling out college applications.
Are you kidding?
You're only in third grade.
Cory said that if you can go to college, anybody can go to college.
Morgan, isn't it time to go bother somebody else?
You know, you're right.
Cory!
I'm in your room!
- Afternoon, Mr. Matthews.
- Hey, Mr. Feeny.
I took your advice.
I'm not gonna let this Boris fiasco faze me.
For every rejection they sent me I'm gonna send out five new applications.
I mean, somebody's gotta cave.
Or make a clerical error.
Very good, Eric.
I thought, perhaps, this might be of help to you.
- What's this?
- Read it.
"A letter of recommendation for Eric Matthews"?
"Exceptional character " "Enormous potential " "Someone I'd bet on.
" Mr. Feeny, I can't speak.
I meant every word.
No, you see, I just sealed 500 envelopes.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
See, Dana, that's why you're such a great kisser.
How do you mean?
Well, you know, a lot of girls trap both lips in this vacuumy-suction thing and, you know, then your mouth caves in, you've gotta break the seal before your lungs pop.
It sounds like you know an awful lot about kissing.
Well, I've done some random sampling.
Purely for scientific reasons.
- Kissing research?
- I don't mind if I do.
I really like you, Dana Pruitt.
- I like you too, Shawn.
- So when's our second date?
I'm doing volunteer work for the blood drive this week.
We could work the sign-up booth together.
Not really my thing.
It's like my dad always says, "Only volunteer if they'll reduce your sentence.
" Well, maybe sometime we could go on a picnic.
Eat outside?
Why?
Just two people sitting on a blanket, really listening to what the other has to say.
I love picnics.
Do you?
No.
Sorry.
How about we get back to what we do best?
You sure put a lot of emphasis on kissing.
I just really like it.
Yeah, that's what I've heard.
Shawn, I don't think a second date is such a good idea, but thanks for tonight.
You're welcome.
What just happened here?
Shawn.
- Needless to say, I'm a little upset.
- You're always upset.
Well, more than usual.
You see, this morning I'm having breakfast with Janitor Bud.
Janitor Bud?
I owed him.
And, you know, we're talking, and it comes up that last night you were out with Dana Pruitt.
Yeah, I went out with Dana.
So?
So, first of all, you don't tell me, and second of all, Dana Pruitt is a very nice girl.
Yeah.
Very nice.
Shawn, a nice girl like that can ruin your reputation.
I mean, Janitor Bud and I were shocked.
Wow.
- And Bud's seen dead bodies.
- I'm saying!
So, what was it like going out with a nice girl?
Cor, I'm not the type of guy that talks about the women I go out with.
Yeah, you are.
Where you been?
I mean, if it wasn't for your stories and the little pictures you draw me, I would know nothing.
Well, I don't wanna talk about Dana.
And don't ask me to draw her.
You must really like this girl.
I like all girls.
And so far they've all liked me.
- Morning, Cory.
- Dana.
Shawn, could I have a word with you in private?
Yeah, sure.
I'll be right over.
Ooh, in private.
What could this be?
Well, she probably wants to finish what we started last night.
So if I'm late for class, fall asleep without me.
Oh, hey, Mr. Williams, I want to talk to you about my journalism paper.
All right.
Another episode of Eric Matthews' Excuse Theater.
All right.
Let me guess.
Let me guess.
You fell behind on your car payments and they repossessed your paper by mistake, huh?
- Wait, wait, Eli, Eli.
Let me play.
- All right, come on.
OK.
OK.
I'm seeing a pet, right?
Lying by a road, huh?
With your term paper in its mouth.
That's funny.
No, look.
Now, I'm not gonna try to snow you.
I know I deserve what I got, but I'm trying to turn things around so I can get into college.
- Study.
- Come on, I'm being serious.
Hey, Eli, what about that news internship at the station?
- Why don't you let him apply?
- Wait a sec, there's an internship?
Yeah, hands-on experience, extra credits What?
At a real TV station?
That's so cool.
- Sign me up, Mr. Williams.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Eric.
There's only one spot available.
There's gonna be a lot of competition.
"A" students.
You know what I mean?
Yeah, I know, and they're all gonna cancel each other out.
I'm a lock!
Thank you, Mr. Williams.
It's a great suggestion, Mr. Turner.
Great suggestion, Mr. Turner.
- What?
It can't hurt to let him take a shot.
- Hey, I know these people.
They're gonna scrutinize every application, look at grades, SAT scores Oh, come on.
What, are you kidding me?
It's television.
He's a lock.
- So?
- Cor.
I got a surprising little problem with the Dana situation.
What?
She wants another date with you and you don't know how to let her down?
She wants another date, but with another guy.
It's probably some pumped up pretty-boy jock, you know.
- It's you.
- Huh.
I was right.
No.
No, I can't, Shawn.
I mean, you asked her out first.
No, no, no, no.
This could be good for you.
She's great, funny, sexy penmanship.
- Does she have little hearts over the i's?
- Yeah.
- I love that.
- Who doesn't?
So, listen, you know Feel free, go for it.
- Are you sure about this?
- Yeah.
You know, I'm sure I'm not gonna be alone for long.
Hey, Rosie, Gina.
These are the girls I should be going out with anyway.
Yes, but, Morgan, how do we really know that the light bulb goes out when you close the door?
Why don't you get in there and find out?
Morgan, time for bed.
I can't.
I'm baby-sitting Shawn.
Morgan, you're the only one in this house with their own bedroom.
- Why don't you ever use it?
- 'Cause life is short.
So are you.
Go to bed.
Shawn, I don't know if you're aware, but Cory, who's actually related to us, left after dinner, so we wouldn't be offended if you did the same.
Thanks, but I'm fine.
You know, I figure I've waited three hours, I might as well wait a couple more minutes for Cory to come back from his date.
I'm sure he's gonna want to talk about it, buddy to buddy.
OK, Shawn.
Well, then we'll just go to sleep.
Buddy to buddy.
Why don't we adopt him?
Get the tax deduction.
Hello.
You come waltzing in here after nine and all I get is "hello"?
Hello sailor?
- Better.
- What are you doing here?
Oh.
Oh, sure, make me out to be the bad guy.
Look Shawn, just because my mom served us maybe the driest turkey ever doesn't mean you have to get mad at me.
It's not about the stinking turkey.
Which I'm still chewing, by the way.
How was your date with Dana?
- It was a date.
- Oh, come on, I give you more than that.
Look, Shawn, if you want to know if I kissed her, the answer's no.
Well, you know, that's OK, that's OK.
- So so do you like her?
- Yeah, she's fine.
No, come on, I mean on a scale of one to ten, how much do you like Dana Pruitt?
Ten being Topanga on your first date and one being the lunchroom lady in a thong.
- Seven.
- Good.
Now, on a scale of one to ten Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, Shawn I've never seen you act like this.
Are you fluey?
I've got a little tickle, but I don't think that's what it is.
You know, I think you're coming down with a bad case of Dana.
I don't know, Cor.
All I know is that all through the dry turkey, knowing you were going out with Dana, I kept just wanting to take the carving knife, and stab you in the head.
No offense.
Um, good.
I'm still here.
- So it's OK if I ask her out?
- I'll stab you in the head if you don't.
You're good people.
Hey, Artie.
It's Arthur.
- I hear we're up for the same internship.
- Eric.
I want to save you the embarrassment.
I'm a straight-A student.
My documentaries have garnered multiple film-festival honors and I have a letter of recommendation from Ted Turner.
Your point?
I could walk in without pants and get this job.
I've seen you in gym class, Arthur.
Wear pants.
- Hey, Shawn.
- Hey, Dana, good to see you.
So are you here to sign up for the blood drive?
- Way ahead of you.
Blood.
- Where did you get this?
Well, I went down to my Uncle Louie's butcher shop this morning.
Shawn, we're collecting human blood.
It's human.
No, no, no, from his arms.
See, he gives all the time.
He didn't even know I took it.
Thanks for thinking of me.
Yeah, there's a couple of pork chops in there for you too.
That's great, it gives me a head start on the pork-chop drive.
It's nice being here talking, isn't it?
I swear, I could be happy talking to you all day.
- Well, what would we talk about?
- Um I - So how was your date with Cory?
- Oh, we had the best time.
He's so sweet.
Really?
That's cool.
That's cool, 'cause Cory told me he had a good time too.
- So why didn't you kiss him?
- Well, you know, it was a first date.
Why rush things?
But you kissed me on the first date.
Yeah, but it's different with you.
How am I different from Cory?
Honestly?
Cory's the type of guy that could turn into a boyfriend.
And you're real cute and everything, Shawn, but face it, with your reputation, you're just What?
You can tell me.
You're not boyfriend material.
So she really said you're not boyfriend material?
I really liked her.
I'm surprised, 'cause she seems like the type of girl that would end up with me.
What are you saying?
I can't end up with nice girls?
No, no.
Calm down, my Shawn.
I mean, I would love to go out with some of the girls you go out with.
But I can't, 'cause I'm stuck being the nice guy, and all those girls want from me is directions to you.
- What do you mean by "those girls"?
- You know, sexy, hot, flashy The kind of girls I've never gone out with in my life.
Except one time.
Hello, flashy.
That's OK, Cory.
I'm happy to be thought of as a nice girl.
- Yeah, yeah, nice girl.
Have a seat.
- Look, Shawn, if this has anything to do with Dana Pruitt, I don't have all the information yet.
I've only been in the bathroom three times this morning.
So, Topanga, as the hottest and perhaps flashiest girl of the nice-girl camp, would you ever consider going out with Shawn?
Well, he'd have to ask me.
Topanga, would you ever consider going out with me?
No.
Well, why wouldn't you go out with me?
- You want the truth?
- Yeah, I want the truth.
- You couldn't handle the truth.
- I could handle the truth.
He could handle the truth.
- No, he couldn't.
- Give him the truth.
And you'll take responsibility for how he feels about it?
Absolutely.
You don't understand women.
You don't know what we are, you don't know how we feel and you don't know what we think.
You see us as dating objects and the faster we are the more you want us.
And until you can grow up and see beyond that, no matter how many girls you go out with, you will always be lonely.
You let her say that to me?
She's lying.
Shawn, look at yourself.
You go from girl to girl and that makes anyone who'd even consider a relationship with you afraid.
- Afraid of what?
- Of getting hurt.
Every girl thinks you'll eventually get bored and move on.
Wow.
They know.
Arthur, thanks for coming down.
Very impressive.
I don't know whether to offer you the intern job or my job.
That's quite a compliment, Miss Cannon.
It would be an honor just to work with a news director of your caliber.
And you have my rÃ©sumÃ©.
I'll finish it over the weekend.
"Boxboy at Daddy's store.
" "Head boxboy.
" What if they check?
- Eric.
- Arthur.
Excuse me, ma'am.
I believe I have an interview.
- And you are?
- Eric Matthews.
There really is an Eric Matthews?
So that rÃ©sumÃ© that Eli sent over wasn't a jo Come on in anyway.
And so, had press coverage into the private lives of past politicians been as invasive as it is today, such men as Franklin Roosevelt, John Kennedy, might never have been elected president.
Mr. Feeny, would you consider John Kennedy a great president?
Well, his time in office was short, but, yes, he accomplished a great deal.
And, now, the fact that he was a babe magnet didn't make him any less great, did it?
In a lot of people's eyes, it did, Shawn.
- Less of a husband, less of a leader.
- Yeah!
Well, I think we've heard from the women.
What do you think, Mr. Hunter?
Well, all I know is that it's not easy for a guy to change who he is.
Yeah.
Whoa, steady.
Whoa, whoa, steady, steady.
- You can't change if you don't try.
- I can't try unless you give me a chance.
- Mr. Hunter, you have spurred a debate.
- Yeah, fine.
When's detention?
No, no, no, it's a good thing.
I like to hear your opinions.
In fact, I would like to hear everyone's in an essay due tomorrow.
You know, Miss Cannon, your office is mighty, mighty hot.
And it was mighty, mighty nice to meet you.
- I'm not gonna get this internship, am I?
- Well, everyone has a chance.
Really?
Oh, don't do this to me.
This just in!
Eric Matthews is a huge loser.
- Why is he a loser?
- Oh.
Sorry, I didn't know anybody else was here.
I'll get out of your way and let you clean.
- I got plenty of time to clean.
- Oh, here.
Were you here for the internship?
Yep.
And I blew it.
Aw.
- How do you know?
- 'Cause I wasn't myself.
Oh, man, I really wanted this job.
- Why?
- Wh 'Cause what could be more exciting than working in TV?
I mean, all those straight-A guys want is something to put on their rÃ©sumÃ©.
You know, they don't get it here, they'll get it someplace else, but this is everything to me.
You know, Miss Cannon doesn't know this, but I'd do that job so much better than any of them 'cause I need it more.
- Did you tell her that?
- No, I was too busy choking.
I just choked in front of the most important person at the station.
- No, you didn't.
- Oh, yeah, I did.
I mean, I was sweating so much in there my shoes started to squish.
No.
No, I meant she's not the most important person at the station.
I am.
Hey, pal, I know coffee's really important and everything, but - Pat Darby, station manager.
- Where?
Right here.
Shaking the hand of our new intern.
See you Monday.
Be yourself or I'll fire you.
Oh, oh.
Oh, yes, sir.
Thank you so much, sir.
Thank you so much.
I'll be here.
One thing, real quick, one thing.
Before I go home and tell my parents, do you have, like, a business card and a photo ID?
Shawn, look, don't let what Topanga said bother you, OK?
I mean, if I listened to everything Topanga told me You guys would still be together.
Then what are you listening to me for?
- Mr. Turner, see what you can do with this.
- You wanna fill me in, Matthews?
- Yeah.
Dana Pruitt.
- Nice girl.
- Shawn Hunter.
- Oh.
OK, now you're up to speed, my work here is done.
Wish me luck, I'm going back out in the blizzard with one mitten.
Godspeed to me.
Hey, Shawn.
- You OK?
- I really like Dana, John.
And I'm pretty sure that she likes me, but she's afraid to get involved with me.
- Ah, the Hunter reputation, huh?
- And I used to be so proud of it.
Wow, Shawn, the only thing you've ever worked on, it blows up in your face.
I lost my other mitten now.
Isn't that something?
Don't mind me, I'll just look.
I mean, what was I thinking even asking out a girl like Dana Pruitt?
Because you liked her and obviously she meant something to you.
Yeah, but what's the difference?
I mean, I know exactly where I belong.
Back with all those fast, flashy girls.
It was blue, fuzzy?
You know, Shawn, it seems to me the people you care most about in the world are not very fast and flashy.
Hey, look!
It's the scarf of mine I lost last year.
Yes!
- You mean Cory, don't you?
- You think?
You see this guy right here?
This is your best relationship.
You guys listen to each other and you really trust each other.
- And that's what girls are looking for?
- Oh, yeah.
Especially the nice ones.
It's funny, 'cause Dana's the only girl that I've ever really listened to.
- Now, you see, does she know that?
- I could tell her.
Do better.
Show her.
I had it the whole time!
You gotta love Velcro, huh?
Hi, Cory.
Dana.
You're playing pool alone?
Well, normally I'd be playing with my best friend, but he's off who knows where moping because some girl played yo-yo with his feelings.
Cory, you know what his reputation is.
Yeah, I know his reputation, OK, but I also know the guy.
I mean, what's more important, Dana, the reputation or the guy?
Look, you went out with me because you thought I was nice.
That's my reputation.
But now I think you know that deep down, Cory Matthews is dangerous, dark and very edgy.
Would the owner of a bright red hypoallergenic ski jacket with one mitten please claim it at the counter?
Oh, I gotta go.
Shawn?
This this seemed like a lot better idea before my lips froze.
- Are you crazy?
It's the middle of winter.
- It's only cold for the first hour or so.
You know, then the numbness kicks in and you can't really feel anything.
You you want some hot soup?
Shawn what are you doing?
I remembered you said you liked picnics.
So I figured, "Why wait till spring"?
Besides, did you know that in winter, picnic baskets are, like, a million percent off?
You mean you were actually listening to what I said?
Look, Dana.
Um You say I'm not boyfriend material, and maybe I'm not, but why won't you give me a chance to try?
Because I'm afraid of you, OK?
Maybe you can't understand that.
But I'm afraid of you.
No, no, I can understand that.
- I'm afraid of you.
- Of me?
Yeah, and it's not even like I love you or anything.
I just like you and want to be with you.
I've never felt that way about a girl before.
And, you know, it scares me.
Come on, let's get you inside.
No.
See, I I want to be out here with you.
I want a second date.
I want to see you again, too.
- Yeah?
Do you mean that?
- Yeah.
You wanna seal it with a kiss?
What's the rush?
OK, now, remember, Morgan, decaf ones are in the chipped cups.
- Uh-oh, I put decaf in this one.
- Uh Problem solved.
I was born to be an intern.
Oh, Eric, how sweet.
You made coffee.
- For the next three years.
- Hey, wait, oh, oh.
Don't touch that, Mom and Dad.
That is for all my coworkers in what we in the biz like to call "the biz.
" Eric, it's early, I'm not following you.
Well, see, part of my job description is to get the crew their coffee.
Eric, I don't think that means you're supposed to bring it from home.
Who said anything about bringing it?
Hey!
Right on time!
Come on in!
Hey, hey.
How are you guys doing?
Come on in.
We got decaf, we got regular Ah!
The muffins.
These TV people love their baked goods.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Hey, you guys are up early.
Well, we didn't have any choice.
Someone was running the shower at 4am, singing "Heigh-ho, heigh-ho.
" That's 'cause it's off to work I go.
So now they want you at the TV station before school?
Yeah.
If I get there early enough I get to help Jimmy Jellybean lace up his floppy feet.
We all know how much the kids love their floppy feet, right, Morgan?
Uh I thought you were just interning for the news.
I am.
When Jimmy Jellybean takes off his nose, he's Arnie Cohen with sports.
Wait, I learned about potty training from a sportscaster?
Oh, that's just wrong.
Eric, wait.
Whoa.
Hey.
You're giving Cory a ride to school, remember?
Dad, you know how much I love driving Miss Cory, but I can't be late for work.
You know, if you were this devoted to your schoolwork, you wouldn't need this internship to pass journalism.
OK, now, first of all, I wasn't failing journalism because of lack of devotion.
I was failing because I was lazy and didn't do the work.
See the difference?
I don't need a new toy chest.
I can store all my toys in his head.
Besides, this internship is the single most important thing I've ever done in my entire life.
I mean, come on, little bro.
- You can walk, can't you?
- In this blizzard?
Oh, sure.
I'll just trudge all the way to school, freeze my butt off, and walk through life buttless.
Good deal.
He used to listen to us, didn't he?
Did you listen to your parents when you were 18?
Well, he's not 18 yet.
By law I can still tell him what to do for two more days.
Cor, if you wait I'll give you a ride.
Nah, that's OK, Mom.
I'm a big boy now.
I think I'm man enough to handle a couple of little snowflakes.
It's the end of the world!
So, Lincoln freed the slaves for political, as well as moral, reasons, demonstrating again that this war was far less civil than its name implies.
But far more civil than I will be if I don't see your papers on my desk by tomorrow.
Mr. Matthews.
- Thanks for dropping by.
- Hey.
Great class, Mr. Feeny.
Two thumbs up.
Eric.
This internship was supposed to earn you credits, - not keep you from graduating.
- Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Mr. Feeny, I'm here now, and once I'm in your school I give you no less than a hundred percent.
Gotta go.
Yeah, picking up the weekend anchor's toupee at the airport.
It's real panda hair from China.
It's all black, with a little bit of white right about here.
- But you didn't hear that from me.
- Mr. Matthews.
Yeah.
Do your paper, or don't graduate.
But you didn't hear that from me.
You know, Dana, having a girlfriend has been such a good influence on me.
I mean, look at us.
We're just hanging out here, studying.
We sure are.
- Are you reading?
- No, are you?
No.
Uh, I thought you said Dana was coming over to do homework.
Look, I'm sorry.
But, you know, you're supposed to be at school.
Dana's mom's about to pick her up, and, you know, John, it'd be nice to have a little privacy.
And we were doing homework, Mr. Turner.
Besides, I kissed him first.
I mean, look at this face.
You know, it actually looks better when you do that.
Oh, that must be my mom.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Uh, I'm here for Dana.
- Oh, uh, she's right here.
Come on in.
- Thanks.
Hi.
- Hey, Mrs. Maguire.
Hi.
Maguire?
I thought your last name was Pruitt.
- It is.
Her father and I are divorced.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
No, it's been a long time.
- Really?
- Mom, this is Mr. Turner.
This is Old Man Turner?
Yeah, my walker's in the shop.
John Oh, Dana.
We should get going.
- It was nice to meet you, Mr. Turner.
- Oh, gosh.
Call me John.
- Call me Susan.
- I just may do that.
OK, OK.
Let's go.
Goodbye.
Get out.
Keep moving.
What kind of disgusting display was that?
- What?
I was just being friendly.
- You were all over her.
Oh, I was not.
And, you know, just for safety reasons, if you're ever over there and I need to get ahold of you what's her number?
Shawn, I'm not gonna ask her out.
- Why can't I ask her out?
- Because she's my girlfriend's mother.
And, frankly, there's something just sick about this whole situation.
Shawn, relax.
I'm not gonna call her.
Hello?
Susan.
It's Dana's mom.
From the car.
So, while you're bundling up and hiding from bad old Mr. Blizzard, your pal Cal is gonna be soaking up the sun and the sand on a Caribbean vacation.
So until then, Philadelphia, this is Cal Kilbride, saying the sun doesn't always shine, but, boy, I sure do!
- The man's a genius.
- And we're out.
Great, Cal.
- Eric, I need that stock footage.
- On your desk.
- And I need the overnight ratings.
- On your desk.
And, uh and my dog?
Being neutered as we speak.
- I said just a shampoo.
- What?
Joke!
Laugh!
- You're doing great, Eric.
- Hey Look, Pat, just between you and me.
Do you ever get nervous hanging around a big star like Cal Kilbride?
- Big fan, huh?
- Oh, are you kidding?
Ever since I first saw Cal, all I ever wanted to be was a weatherman.
The power of it, affecting millions of people.
What do they wear?
Do they wear a sweater, sunscreen, gloves, snow tires?
Yes, no, what do they do?
Well, then, say hi.
Eric, you're part of the team.
Cal - he's a regular guy.
He's like everybody else.
Just make sure you approach him from his left.
- He's got a thing about his other side.
- OK.
Uh, excuse me, Mr. Kilbride?
Hi, I'm Eric Matthews.
I'm the new intern.
Thank you very much.
Look, I just want to say what an honor it is to be working here with a man like you, and if there's anything that you need to have done, you know, you can just call me anytime, no matter how small or personal it might be.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, boy.
I don't believe in that pecking-order garbage around here.
Come on, we're all equals on this ship, huh?
From me on top, all the way down to you.
Oh, by the way, could I get my pants hemmed?
- I'd be honored.
- Great.
Thank you, Eric.
Do a good job on the pants, who knows?
Hey, hey, Matthews.
Nice to see you finally showing up around here.
That looks like Johnny Higgins, the weekend anchor.
Yeah.
It's his hair.
You didn't hear that from me, though, all right?
Matthews, this internship doesn't excuse you from the classwork.
You know, Mr. Williams, I would love to stay and chat, - but if this doesn't go on, he doesn't go on.
- Hey, Matthews, wait Hey, thanks a lot for helping me get that internship.
Man, that is some blizzard out there, huh?
Yeah, so blizzardy you came to the wrong place.
You overshot the school by about six miles.
So did you.
Come on, Mr. Williams.
I had to come in.
I mean, with the weather they had a lot of no-shows.
And I've had one.
You.
Now look, man.
I'm on your side, but you are not a strong enough student to keep up your grades and spend all your time here.
Where's Rich Herrera?
I'm on the air in two minutes and I don't have a backup weatherman.
- Eli, shut up.
- Hey.
You're gloating 'cause you don't work for me anymore.
Pat, all the time we spent together, you think that I would gloat?
A minute 45.
Hey, hey, Pat, this isn't a problem.
Just have Arnie Cohen do it after sports.
Arnie?
The man's half-clown.
Come on, Pat.
I mean, anybody can do this.
Look, you walk over here, you find your mark, you pick up the clicker, hm?
Watch the monitor, point to the map, big smile And now back to you, Connie.
- Where'd you learn to do that?
- I've been studying Cal.
- Eric, why don't you do it?
- Do what?
- The weather.
- Me?
You do a good job, we both look good.
You screw up Don't.
Now get in there and have some fun.
Oh, I'm filling in for Cal Kilbride.
I think I'm gonna cry.
There's no time.
No time.
Here we go.
In five, four, three, two And now, the WIXB five o'clock report.
With Connie Yamaguchi, Arnie Cohen, sports, and, filling in for vacationing Cal Kilbride, Eric Matthews, weather.
That's me!
So, huh?
Did you see me?
You were so good, and you were so handsome.
- Way to go, pal.
- Bravo, Eric.
- Oh, thank you, Mr. Feeny.
- You know, when you were three years old and you told us you wanted to be a weatherman, we shouldn't have taken you to that doctor.
OK, now, Mr. Feeny, I can ask you this 'cause you don't love me as much as them.
Did you like me better on the five or ten o'clock edition?
I'm actually here to talk about your history paper and the classes you've missed.
Eric, Mr. Feeny says that you're in serious danger of not graduating.
But you are very lucky because he's gonna allow you to make up the work.
Great.
What do I have to do?
A 2,000-word essay on reconstructionism after the Civil War.
- Fine.
Done.
When do you need it?
- On my desk by three o'clock, Friday.
Ooh.
Not in my five-day forecast.
I'm on call all week.
Well, put it in your forecast, pal.
You're doing that essay.
Dad, I can't possibly do both, and You can't be asking me to give up the station.
I mean, I finally found something I'm good at.
- This isn't a discussion.
- Eric, think about this.
I have.
And I'm going back to the station.
I mean, that is where I belong.
I don't belong in the back of some classroom pretending to listen.
No offense, Mr. Feeny.
Eric, you see, that is your problem.
You don't listen.
Dad, look, I'm gonna be 18 tomorrow, in like, less than an hour.
- I think I can make my own decisions.
- Eric, I urge you to reconsider.
- There's nothing more to think about.
- Eric, are you, or are you not, going to go to school tomorrow?
I'm not going.
I can't believe I'm related to a dropout.
He's not a dropout.
Yet.
No, he's just taking a leave of absence, right?
You know, like the guy with the tinfoil hat who pushes the baby carriage filled with empty tuna-fish cans.
Looks like I'm gonna be the first Matthews to graduate from college.
- What about me?
- Yeah, right.
Morning.
- Morning.
- Morning.
- Oh, Eric - Look, Cor, I'm really not in the mood right now, all right?
OK.
I was just gonna wish you a happy birthday.
Hey.
Take a hat.
Another storm front's coming in.
- You know, you're pretty good at that stuff.
- Cory, school.
Oh, I'm there.
"Cory Matthews"?
"Here.
" So, I hope we had a good night's rest.
- Slept like a baby.
- 'Cause you are one.
Alan, we agreed.
We'll cool down, clear our heads, and have a logical discussion in the morning.
Right.
Eric, honey, I know that last night was like a dream come true to you.
Look, Mom, I know where this is going, and I know what I'm doing.
I'm going back to the station.
- And I'm going to yell.
- Alan, it is not going to help.
No.
I am not gonna remain quiet while my son makes the biggest mistake of his life.
Now, you may be some big-shot weatherman down at channel whatever it is, but here you're still my son, living in my house.
Yeah, but I'm 18 today.
Fine.
You wanna play adult?
Then let's play.
You want to continue sleeping in that room of yours upstairs, you pay rent.
Car insurance.
You pay that too.
Groceries.
Are you starting to get the idea?
Yeah.
Yeah, I get it.
I get that you two don't realize how important this job is to me.
And you know something?
If paying rent is my birthday present, well, then, happy birthday to me.
Here.
You want your rent?
Here.
Here is your rent.
Well breakfast, anyway.
- Eric.
- What?
!
Happy birthday.
Thanks, Mom.
Alan Where are they?
Where are they?
I mean, what kind of date goes past nine o'clock?
Shawn, will you stop?
Your pacing is making me nervous.
Oh, and your nagging, like that's helping me?
See what their going out is doing to us?
You're right.
You're right, Dana.
We shouldn't fight.
- We still have our relationship.
- Which is going quite well.
Wait!
What if they really like each other, and get married?
- I'm gonna call the restaurant.
- Yeah, good.
- Where'd they go?
- Some Italian restaurant.
OK.
OK.
Italian, Italian.
There's more than one!
- Hi, guys.
- Stay out of trouble?
We should be asking you the same thing.
- What are you staring at?
- OK, OK.
I'm just checking to see if she left any lip prints.
Who are you calling "she"?
She happens to be my mother.
She happens to be seducing my buddy over here.
- Guys - Mom, I think we've been insulted enough.
- Let's go.
- No, no, no.
Nobody's going anywhere.
We have something to tell you.
Sit.
- Oh, no.
- We're sisters.
Hold it, hold it, hold it.
Nobody's nobody's sister.
- Look, we had a great time tonight.
- Oh, no.
But we decided that it would be too awkward for you guys, so we're not gonna see each other anymore.
What?
My mother isn't good enough for you?
You just never gave him a chance.
Dana?
Dana?
And as Blizzard Watch '96 continues, schools tomorrow are once again closed.
Oh, that takes me back.
We're gonna This just in.
"We just received a call from Principal George Feeny, who said it's gonna take more than 32 inches of snow to close down John Adams High.
" "And, Eric, your report is still due.
" Happy hundredth birthday, Mr. Feeny.
Let's take one last look at the big map, shall we?
- Happy birthday!
- Oh!
Oh, guys.
That is so nice.
Who told you?
- You did.
- Oh, well, uh, I guess I did.
I'd just like to say thank you.
These last couple of days have been like a dream come true to me.
I'll see you tomorrow, Philadelphia.
And we're out.
Guys, thank you so much.
What a nice thought.
Hey, I'm cutting the cake.
Oh.
Pat, Pat.
The birthday wishes, the balloons, the cake, but especially the job - this is the nicest thing anybody's ever done for me.
Look, there's not a nice way to tell you this, and I really appreciate you helping me out, but I I got a real weatherman coming down from Boston.
I'm sorry?
You did great, Eric.
Then how come you're firing me?
Come on, you're a kid.
You didn't expect me just to hand you the job full time?
No, no.
I was just having a lot of fun, you know, but Yeah, I guess it was too good to be true.
Hey, you know, I love being an intern here, so I'll see you tomorrow.
Bright and early?
Hey, now, after being on the air, you really think you can go back to being a gofer?
I gotta do something.
I mean, I'm not in school anymore.
- What do you mean?
- Well, I kinda dropped out.
You know, to give you guys a hundred percent.
Oh, Eric.
We got a problem here.
You do know the internship's only open to students?
No.
No, no, no, no.
Pat, don't do this to me.
I mean, you can't take this away from me.
This is all I have.
I got noplace else to go.
This whole thing, it's not fair.
Look, Eric, I I tell you what, after college, you give me a call, I'll be happy to give you a job.
You're a good man.
Your parents should be real proud.
Cardboard.
Figures.
Oh, Eric.
There you are.
- Dad?
- Yeah.
Look, Dad, if you came down here to fight some more, - I really don't have the strength, all right?
- No.
No, no.
I just came down to see how you're doing.
See where you work.
Well, you know, this place looks a lot bigger on TV, doesn't it?
- Dad, what are you doing here?
- Uh, well, I came down here 'cause Well, I really blew it this morning and I really need to tell you something.
What?
You know, after high school I never went to college.
I went right into the navy.
- I know that.
- Yeah, well, what you don't know is how angry my dad was.
Angry enough not to wish you a happy birthday?
I deserve that.
Well, he took out all his frustrations on me, the way I did on you, and things were never the same between me and him after that.
Look, I don't have to agree with what you did, I mean, dropping out of school made life a lot harder for me, but that gives me no right to turn my back on you.
You're my son.
Always.
I know that.
And I don't want to make the same mistake my father did.
Neither do I. Happy birthday, son.
Happy birthday, Dad.
You know what I mean.
Mr. Matthews.
You're pretty early for someone who's no longer a student.
Uh Yeah, I thought about that.
I thought about it all night, actually, while I was writing this.
- Your history paper.
- Yep.
It's just what you wanted.
I said 2,000.
Whoa!
Uh That should do.
Just like that, hm?
It can be that easy?
You walk in here, turn in your paper, and all is forgotten.
Mr. Feeny, please.
I just had my butt kicked out there in the real world.
They fired me, and I really need somebody to cut me some slack.
Why should I cut you some slack?
You got a job, you lost a job, so go and find another one.
Without a high-school diploma?
You know, Mr. Feeny, I don't know if you know this or not, but it's really tough out there.
- Is it really?
- Yeah.
Well, then, perhaps you did learn something from that internship.
Welcome back.
- Thank you, Mr. Feeny.
I - Don't hug me.
Um, you know, I think there's one open in back.
I would like to shift gears slightly, and discuss those traveling entrepreneurs called the carpetbaggers.
It's good to be like this again, isn't it?
Yeah.
Back at each other's lips instead of each other's throats.
And so what if your mom wanted to date Mr. Turner.
You know, it probably shouldn't have affected us.
I think we kinda acted a little immature.
Two people should be free to date whoever they want.
I totally agree.
We should just put this thing in the past and move on.
- I know my mom has.
- Yeah, so has Mr. Turner.
I mean, he's supposed to meet a date here tonight, at Chubbie's.
Isn't that great, Dana?
Dana?
Dana?
Oh, my God!
Mr. Turner's hitting on my aunt.
We're gonna be cousins.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
- Matthews, what's with the camera?
- Well, Mr. Williams says a good newsman's always gotta have his camera ready.
You don't mind if I keep on shooting, do you?
- No, go ahead.
- All right.
Hey!
- Turn that thing off, I'll let you back in.
- Oh, come on, what are you hiding?
My disdain for you.
- Shawn, Shawn.
- On the phone, Cor.
So, Dad, how are you gonna celebrate your birthday?
Oh, that's great.
He's going to the dog track with President Clinton.
So, are you coming home soon?
Yeah.
Yeah, I understand.
Oh, well, I really miss you.
Where's Shawn's dad calling from?
He said aboard Air Force One, but I kinda have my doubts.
I heard people yelling in Spanish.
Well, I'm glad to hear you're doing so well.
What?
Oh, you gotta go?
Oh, the president needs the phone.
Yeltsin's on call waiting.
OK, well, I can't wait to Hello?
Hello?
Didn't even get a chance to sing him "Happy Birthday.
" You miss him, huh?
Oh, family's really important to the Hunters.
You know, my dad always said, "Where there's family, there's a place to hide.
" Did he say when he's coming back?
No, but he did say he can't wait to see me.
I bet it'd make him really happy to see how well I'm doing.
- Hey, well, he can.
- What do you mean?
Well, Matthews has his video camera.
You could put yourself on tape.
Yeah.
Shawn, you know, we could go down to your old trailer park and get all your relatives on tape.
I'll shoot it.
Well, Shawn, what do you say?
Putting the Hunter family on tape.
It'd be great.
It'd be like Court TV.
Without the court.
Shawn, I got a light, camera, video.
Everything we need to film your family.
Oh, great.
Hey, Cory.
Remember when you're around my Aunt Lorena, keep your hands where she can see 'em and don't reach for anything quickly in your pocket.
Hey, Matthews.
Hey, Williams.
Comma, Mister.
Glad to see you signed out all this video equipment.
I guess you're entering that news contest Channel Five's running.
No, actually, Cory's just shooting a video for me.
Wait, wait.
What contest is this?
Well, it's open to high-school kids all across Philly and they're running the best story on the air.
- I think you got a shot.
- Why, Mr. Williams, you flatter me.
You're pretty good with that camera, but you'd better get on it, it's due in two days.
Cory, what about the trailer park?
Uh, thanks, Mr. Williams, but, you know, I already promised Shawn.
All right, it's your call, but I'm telling you, if you get inspired and win a contest like this you are on your way, my man.
Well, I hear you.
Hey, slap me some!
You gotta be kidding.
Come along, Mr. Matthews, don't dawdle.
I'm not dawdling.
I'm just not wearing any underwear.
A little more than I needed to know.
Mr. Feeny, what are you gonna do with this junky old lamp?
That junky old lamp is worth over $800.
Without a light bulb?
Pshaw.
Come on, Mr. Feeny, bottom line me.
Well, I was cleaning out my attic and I stumbled on a trunk that belonged to my Great Aunt Fannie.
Fannie Feeny?
Don't go there.
Anyway, out of curiosity, I took it to Lankershim and Sloan's.
Ah, the roofers.
No.
The appraisal house.
They invite the public to bring in their so-called junk.
Every once in a while you find a treasure.
Everyday junk worth something.
Hey, wait a second, Mr. Feeny.
Wait a second.
Hold up.
I got a great idea.
Think about it.
Your junk, my junk, we'll go into business together.
Can't you see it?
Eric and Sons.
I can see why you get first billing.
Well, let's start with my Uncle Mike.
You'll love him.
Of all my relatives he's easily the warmest and friendliest.
Get lost, scum!
Shawn, maybe we shouldn't bother your uncle.
I think that's my aunt.
Uncle Mike, open up.
There is no Uncle Mike.
I'm an old shut-in living on my pension.
- Go away!
- It's me, your nephew, Shawn.
Shawn?
Shawny!
Hey!
What's with the camera?
- Shawn, you setting me up?
- No.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Uncle Mike, do you remember that video letter I told you about?
- Well, this is my buddy, Cory.
- How are you doing, Uncle Mike?
What do you know?
- Nothing.
- Then I'm doing great.
Hey, Uncle Mike, I really appreciate you doing this for me.
Hey.
I know how much family means to you, Shawny.
And besides, everybody here at the old Pink Flamingo Trailer Park is real excited about being a part of it.
Well, except for Grandpa Lewis.
Last week he got picked up.
- Police?
- Tornado.
Well, Uncle Mike, why don't you call everyone together and we can get started?
OK.
All Hunters, out now!
We didn't do it.
That's our family motto.
And go!
Hi, Dad, it's me, standing here with Grandma Hunter and her attorney.
Now, since Grandma's under a gag order and medication, her attorney's prepared the following statement: "To my alleged son Chet.
Happy birthday.
" "These loving words are in no way an admission of guilt in the trial of The People v Gertie Hunter.
" Any woman that can give birth to me is one tough broad.
Hey, Cory, thanks again for doing this.
Man, I have never seen my family open up like this.
Shawn, nobody's said anything.
Maybe the problem lies within you, outsider.
That's food for thought, sir.
I could take you.
Shawn.
Your uncle's insane.
It was an option, but he never pleaded that way.
Look, I just think the tape would be better if we got the family to, you know, talk a little more.
Hey, you want a Hunter to talk, put 'em in a situation where they're not afraid to talk.
- Action!
- Happy birthday, Chet, from all the Hunters here at this undisclosed location.
OK.
I'm gonna turn the camera off, all right?
I'm not going for my pockets.
You know, Uncle Mike, Dad's really gonna get a kick out of this.
Yeah, it was nice to have the family together.
Yeah, I'll be sure to send you a copy.
Why would you make copies?
- You're a tall, tall man.
- Thanks.
You know, Shawny, you got a good friend here.
- Uncle Mike.
- Hey.
It fell out.
- So, anybody else we gotta talk to?
- No, that's pretty much everybody.
Look who's slumming.
It's Shawn.
Eddie.
I guess this is the part where you wise up and move back to the trailer park.
You know we missed you.
- No, I'm real happy living where I am.
- Oh, yeah.
Out in the suburbs.
Where there are fancy homes built into the ground.
- Hey, built-in.
- Me?
You got a name?
Uh, it's Cory.
But my karate students refer to me as Dr. Pain.
- I could take you.
- What are you?
12?
This is a nice camera.
- It's mine.
- What are you doing with it here?
We're just filming some video of, you know, old friends and family.
And you didn't ask me to be in it?
Should I be insulted?
- Shawn, I got plenty of tape.
- Cory, no.
Look.
Eddie, I'm not bothering anybody, so why don't you and your friends just get lost?
No.
No, no, no, no.
See, we still live here.
You don't.
So the way I see it, you and your friend Corky Dorky here should get lost.
- Hey!
- Hey, what?
Hey what's the fastest way outta here?
- Eric, you're filthy.
- Yeah, filthy rich.
Why do you have a box full of junk?
Junk!
You call these gambling dogs "junk"?
Alan, take the sharp things out of that box.
All right, obviously you guys aren't gonna figure this one out by yourselves.
Obviously.
See, Mr. Feeny had goobles of old junk lying around his house.
Well, he found out some of it could be worth a ton of money.
- So I said to myself, "Kyle " - Kyle?
That's what I call myself.
So I said, "Kyle, you should get under this bandwagon and make some money by cleaning out that room of yours.
" Eric, Mr. Feeny's collectibles are from all over the world.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Amy, Amy, whoa, whoa.
I I think Eric might be on to something here.
Hm?
You know, the garage and the attic, it might be chock-full of undiscovered treasures.
Why don't you clean them out, see what you can find?
Wait a minute.
Clean out the garage and the attic?
You guys would let me?
Whatever makes you and Kyle happy.
Yes!
Uh, Mom, Dad, we're going over to Shawn's to watch a tape.
OK?
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!
Hold up a second there, Hunter.
What have you got in that box?
Just some junk I picked up at the trailer park.
Give you 30 bucks for that pink flamingo.
Sure.
Here you go.
You sucker.
"Hey, your house is on my lawn"!
Shawn, sorry about that, but that guy Eddie walked through the shot.
You know, I didn't say anything seeing as how that scary little It's no big deal.
Hey, look.
Eddie's carrying a computer.
What do you know?
The guy's a closet nerd.
Or maybe it's not his.
Well, if it's not his then that would mean Oh, my God, it's stolen.
- And I have it on tape.
This is great!
- Why is it great?
You know, that news contest on Channel Five.
How could a story like this not win?
We went there to film my family, not to win you some news award.
Look, Shawn, you got your video, right?
And I got my hot story.
Look, do me a favor, OK?
Just forget about the tape.
Oh, come on.
Give me a reason.
I don't have to.
Why don't you just drop it and go home?
No.
I'm not going anywhere without my tape.
- You want it?
- Yeah.
Fine.
Here.
Shawn, what are you doing?
You had no right to do that!
It's my family.
I can do whatever I want.
That's the last time I do you a favor, Hunter.
Hey, Cor, my dad called from the White House this morning.
- He got to use the Oval toilet.
- Look, Shawn, the only thing I want to hear from you right now is an explanation, all right?
What, is this about the tape?
Look, I'm sorry.
That's not an explanation.
Why did you rip up my tape?
It just happened, OK?
Shawn, I caught those guys on tape stealing computers, all right?
I could have won an award or something.
- Maybe I was doing you a favor.
- No, no.
You know what I think, Shawn?
I think it bothers you that I've finally found something I'm good at.
I think you should shut up and let go of me right now.
Shawn, why are you acting like I did something to you?
I said let go of me.
Fine.
All right, let's see what you got, Hunter.
No, no.
- Look, Cory, you don't want to do this.
- Yeah, I do.
Fight!
Fight!
- Hey!
Come on!
Come on!
- Break it up!
Break it up!
- Get back to class now.
- All of you, get back to class.
Hunter?
Matthews?
Did you guys know you were fighting each other?
- I'm outta here.
- No, no, no, I don't think so, Shawn.
Not until somebody tells me why you guys were going at it.
What do you want me to say?
I'm good with a camera and this guy's jealous.
Yeah, you know when I'll be jealous of you, Cory?
When you can do this.
Hey, hey, watch it.
I can't do that either.
Look.
Mr. Williams, I've been inspired, all right?
I want you to enter me in that news contest.
I don't think you'll have the time, Mr. Matthews.
Detention?
Let's not call it detention.
I prefer Hooked on Feeny.
Well, Mr. Feeny, it was excellent detention as usual, although I wasn't thrilled with your choice of my co-detainee, but we'll have to do this again sometime.
Your reservations are confirmed for tomorrow.
Hey.
Are you really going down to the trailer park?
Not that I care.
Yeah, that's exactly where I'm going.
Listen, Cory.
I'm telling you, don't go.
Those guys down there, they're hardcore.
You could get hurt.
Shawn, I can take care of myself, all right?
Mr. Hunter.
This hitting thing, it's not nice.
I'm sorry, I'm just really frustrated.
Does that help your frustration?
Yeah.
Ow.
- What did you do that for?
- Well, I'm frustrated too.
Why?
I'm frustrated to see two young men throw away a friendship.
Yeah, well, the way I see it, Mr. Feeny, you don't need friends.
OK?
Especially friends like him.
Then who do you count on, Mr. Hunter?
Family.
Your family is always there for you.
Come on, Mr. Feeny, a guy like you with no friends, you gotta know I'm right.
I mean, you've got to have a lot of family.
Well, actually, I have very little family in Philadelphia.
Yeah?
So what do you do on holidays and birthdays and stuff?
I get together with a small circle of very close friends.
It's really quite nice.
We laugh, we reminisce.
We take pride in each other.
Pretty much what you've always done with Matthews.
Yeah, but it can't be the same as being with real family.
Oh, Mr. Hunter.
You don't have to be blood to be family.
- Is the attic done?
- Oh, the attic and the garage.
I mean, hey!
Boy, I robbed you guys blind.
Oh, you didn't rob anyone.
It's just junk.
We've been meaning to clean it out for years.
Junk?
It's not junk!
Treasures!
Treasures, I say!
- Alan, tell him!
- Oh, OK.
Now that the house is clean.
Um Lankershim's and Sloan is running a scam.
I mean, how much are they gonna charge you to appraise this stuff?
$60.
Yeah, but see, I already had 70 in my wallet so it looks like I've already made ten bucks.
Eric, come on, let me help you haul this junk out to the trash.
Hey, ho, ho, ho!
Take your paws off that stuff.
This is my future we're talking about here.
Oh, look, Amy.
His future is macaroni art.
All right.
Now for a little magic.
Let's make some serial numbers disappear.
This is great.
I gotta I gotta get closer.
Wait.
I gotta get closer.
Too close.
What the heck is going on here?
No speaky.
I remember you.
You're Shawn's friend.
Yeah.
And he was filming us.
You have no idea how much trouble you're in.
Well, I-I think I have a pretty good idea, you know.
Let me see the camera.
Oh, well, now you've done it.
That is the property of John Adams High, my friend.
I'm gonna need some names and addresses.
My name is You're Dead.
And I live at the corner of Fist and Face.
Coming here was a big, big mistake.
Look, Eddie, Eddie, you made your point, all right?
Now just let me go, OK?
- Maybe he's had enough.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
The little guy's right.
Who are you calling little?
Argh!
I gotta stop thinking out loud.
Here's my problem.
I can't let you leave because I can't trust you.
So what do I do?
Maybe I keep pounding your face into the ground until you forget everything that happened tonight.
- Shawn.
- Back off, Eddie.
- Shawn, you got no business here.
- Yeah, well, it looks like I do.
You touch this guy again and you've got me to deal with.
- What?
You're gonna take a swing at me?
- No.
Then what are you gonna do?
I'll call the cops.
Let them figure it out.
Police.
You would do that to family?
Yeah.
- Shawn, what's he talking - Cor, just stay out of this.
Look.
Eddie, I'm serious.
I'll turn you in.
Come on, man, I'm your brother.
I'll do it if I have to.
Like you're so much better than me.
I'm on my way to be.
OK.
OK.
Go pretend.
Play hero.
But you'll be back.
This is who you are.
Just get outta here.
Ah, come on, let's go.
A brother?
- You have a brother?
- A half brother.
Sh-Shawn, what else have you been hiding?
A wife?
You got kids?
Sorry, Cor.
It just didn't seem worth talking about.
So that's why you didn't want me to hand in my story.
- You were protecting family.
- I guess.
They broke your camera.
- Sorry about that.
- They didn't get the tape.
You know, Mr. Williams was right.
You are a pretty good reporter.
Take it.
It's your family.
No, no, you take it.
Go win that contest.
What about protecting your family?
I just did.
Eddie's only blood.
You're my family.
- Hey, Mom, Dad.
- Uh, Eric.
About the work you did on the attic and the garage.
Your mother, being the sensitive, guilty soul that she is Oh, Alan, will you stop it?
We're gonna pay you for your work.
60 bucks.
- Oh.
- Amy, uh You got some change?
We need some twenties.
Wait, hang on a second.
Let me see if I can help you out.
Oh.
No can do.
Only got hundreds.
Where did you get that?
Oh, from that scam house.
Lankershim and Sloan's.
Well, one of those boxes had an old wooden mask.
They were so impressed they gave me a few reasons why I should sell it to 'em right on the spot.
- How-how many reasons?
- 4,000 reasons.
Hey, Mr. Feeny.
Mr, Feeny, look.
$4,000.
I'm a millionaire.
I'm a millionaire!
I'm sure you are.
Amy, do you remember that box you were storing for me?
Sure.
It was in the garage.
Terrific.
I'm on my way to the appraisal.
There's an old kabuki mask in it.
I'm curious to see if I can make a few dollars off of it.
Hey, hey, Mr. Feeny, How does $500 sound to you?
Eric.
Here.
Just take it.
Just take it.
I'm a millionaire!
I'm a millionaire!
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Finals!
Oh, my God.
I didn't even see it coming.
- Three in one day!
- English, chemistry, and history.
With only ten minutes in between?
That's not enough time to study.
Cory, do not even try to call me for the next two weeks.
I'll be incommunicado.
Wow, that's guts.
We're studying, and she's off to Mexico.
- This schedule stinks, man.
- Whoa, guys.
Guys, calm down, all right?
Now, if we devote the next two weeks to studying in the library, we got no problem.
Guys, we got a problem here.
I mean, finals start in two days.
- How did this sneak up on us?
- I don't know, man, 'cause these books haven't left my side in two weeks.
You know, Shawn, what kind of evil, sick, twisted mind would think of a finals schedule like this?
Hi, gang.
Mr. Feeny, about this finals schedule.
It's either gotta be a mistake or a joke.
And, let's face it, you're not really funny.
And you're not really studying.
I suggest you do.
You know, if we just buckle down and study, I'm sure we would have no problem at all.
I'll tell you when we've got no problem.
It's when you get rid of Feeny.
- What do you mean?
- I mean get rid of him.
Those guys give me the creeps.
Yeah, but we do have a real gripe here.
I mean, too much work, not enough time.
You know, gang, the only way Feeny's gonna listen to us is if we organize and show strength.
- Right?
- Yeah!
So are you with me?
OK, Mr. Turner.
Now, we go to school all year, and I'll be honest, we don't like it.
And now it's the end of the year, and we gotta take all these finals about stuff we already learned, and, naturally, have forgotten about.
- I mean, why does Feeny like torturing us?
- Have you got a point, Matthews?
- Well, yeah.
We're very upset.
- Yeah.
So?
It's a tough schedule.
That's what school's all about.
Yeah, but not this tough.
I mean, people are starting to crack.
Hydrogen, helium, lithium, beryllium, boron, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen And she's not even in chemistry.
Feeny's schedule is a conspiracy, man.
It's exactly like the government not telling us about the aliens that are living in our old trailer park.
- Mr. and Mrs. Monroe.
- Uh-huh.
And their little dog, too.
Look, it's not enough that we have to take all these finals, but why does he have to jam them all together?
Yeah.
It's a reasonable question.
I tell you what.
I'll talk to Feeny.
I'll get a reasonable answer.
- No!
- George, I I am not about to change my finals policy to suit the whims of a few disgruntled students.
Yeah, but, George, I think they may have a point.
I mean, why do we have to lump these finals together like that?
I mean, wouldn't it be easier if we just spread them out, just a little bit?
That would be much easier.
And if we ask them simpler questions, that would be easier still.
If we had no tests, just put on party hats and played the hokey-pokey.
I dare say that my students would love me.
If you lose the hokey-pokey thing, I think you're on to something.
George, I think they may have a valid concern.
I mean, can't you at least hear them out?
I will always have time to listen to my students.
So?
So?
Schedule changed?
He agreed to listen to one of you, so appoint a leader.
- Oh, look.
A quarter.
- Yeah!
All right, Cory.
You're our leader.
Boy, you guys have to be the cheapest gang I've ever seen.
All right, Matthews.
But if you can't change that old dinosaur's mind, we will.
Hey, Denny, Denny.
I've known the guy since I was in diapers.
I mean, I ate his dirt, for crying out loud.
Mr. Matthews.
I understand you have some concerns about the finals.
Uh, yes.
Yes I do.
Because, you gotta admit, three finals in one day is kinda tough.
How long has the exam schedule been posted?
Couple of days.
Two weeks.
And how long have you had to study the material?
Two weeks.
All semester.
And you come to me now?
How can I take you seriously?
OK.
I didn't wanna use this, but we're neighbors, right?
- Oh, here we go.
- All right.
Do you remember back when I was a kid, and I ate all that dirt, and you were good enough to call poison control?
I wanted my dirt back.
Well, I guess I want you to kinda do that again.
You know, one lifelong friend to another.
Cory.
George.
Get out.
So, Matthews, what does the new schedule look like?
Uh, well, to many of you it will look much like the old schedule, but I, as your leader I got nothing.
So the old dinosaur made no changes at all?
- 'Fraid not.
- Look, Matthews, you had your chance.
And your way worked for, uh never!
- Now it's time to do things my way.
- Well, what is your way?
Look, Feeny has made our lives miserable, uh forever.
And now it's time to give him back a little bit of what he gave us.
- Are you with me?
- Yeah!
- All right.
- All right!
- Let's go.
- Let's do it.
Shawn, Shawn.
Where are you going?
Cory, I hate these exams.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I'm Brenda.
Oh, right.
Hi.
Um - You obviously didn't get the message.
- Amy left a message?
Yeah, they had car trouble.
They're not gonna be able to make it.
Oh, well, so - I guess it's just you and me then, huh?
- Uh, yeah.
Just you and me, and the collective works of Billy-Bob Shakespeare.
Right.
Amy told me you're very devoted to your work.
Yeah.
Oh, my God.
Yeah, I know.
I was hitting puberty the exact moment they took that picture.
No, uh, I thought you were Jonathan Turner.
Your mother was fixing us up tonight, and - I feel really stupid.
- Wait, uh, no!
No, I Not at all.
I'm actually kinda flattered.
Look, I mean, my mom already called and cancelled Mr. Turner, and I haven't had dinner yet, so what say we go grab a little bite-ski?
- A little bite-ski, huh?
- Yeah.
- All right.
Let's go.
- Great.
All right.
Well, let's get out of here before you get any older.
Hey, that's funny.
Let's get outta here!
So, while the abolitionist, John Brown, thought of himself as a hero because of his night raids, he was eventually captured and hanged by the neck for his crimes.
So, with that we conclude the semester.
Finals are tomorrow.
I want to wish you all good luck.
Mr. Feeny, will the chapter on the Continental Congress be included in the test?
- Miss Lawrence - Wait!
Wait.
Miss Lawrence, you've done the work all semester.
I have no doubt that everything you need to know, you already know.
Continental Congress, yes or no?
Yes, Miss Lawrence.
Uh, Mr. Feeny?
Look, about what happened last night Yes?
- I was at the library.
- No one is accusing you.
I know you better than that.
Look, I think what those idiots did was way out of line.
Yes, Mr. Matthews.
I must agree.
I haven't always been popular with my students, but I've always had their respect.
Until last night.
You know, they're just frustrated over the exam schedule.
Frustrated?
You know, Mr. Matthews, there was a very small faction of students who were frustrated.
But the majority of them wanted to learn.
Now, with each passing year I find that authority and respect have rotted away.
And that small faction is now the majority.
Wait, Mr. Feeny, wouldn't it be easier to just spread the exams out?
You know, I mean, it makes us happier and it takes off the pressure.
Oh, yes, but don't you see?
That little bit of pressure forces that tiny nugget of education past baseball statistics, girls' phone numbers, into a place where you can store it.
And recall it.
And maybe even someday use it, huh?
Oh.
You know, Mr. Matthews, at the end of each school year, I also take a final examination.
I bet you do really well.
I examine my effectiveness as a teacher.
And I wonder: "What have I taught?
Who have I reached this year"?
Well, this year, after seeing what was done to my house, I realize that they have finally reached me.
What do you mean?
I believe the term was "dinosaur," wasn't it?
I'm an old dinosaur.
Which is a good thing.
I mean, people love dinosaurs.
I mean, you got your Barneys, right?
- Your Jurassic Parks?
- Mr. Matthews And who could forget about Dino Flintstone, right?
Mr. Matthews, I'm retiring at the end of the year.
The official announcement will be very soon.
Hey, Feeny.
- About your exam schedule.
- Yes, Mr. Burgess?
If you don't move it to later in the week, we ain't gonna show.
Well, that is your right.
And, of course, if you don't take the exam, it is my right to fail you.
Hm?
That old dinosaur just doesn't know when to become extinct.
Man, I wish I could've seen his face when he saw his house.
I did.
So, Matthews, you kiss-up, what did you tell him?
- Get off me.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Easy, easy.
Look, Cory's cool, OK?
He wouldn't have squealed.
Does that make me cool, Shawn?
Is that what makes you so cool?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Cory, Cory?
Lighten up, OK?
You're the one that said we should stand up to Feeny.
Yeah, but, Shawn, I didn't say vandalize his home.
Hey, I wasn't there, OK?
I didn't do anything.
- Yeah, but you knew about it.
- Yeah, but what was I supposed to do?
Stand up and say, "Stay away from Feeny's house"?
Look.
You didn't stop them, Shawn, OK?
And I think that makes you responsible.
Me?
You're the one that started this whole thing.
Then I think that makes me responsible too.
Well, once again, thanks for your help.
Well, I couldn't reach all the eggs, but, you know, if you throw a bunch of cheese up there and wait for a hot day, you're gonna have one heck of an omelet.
- You're a funny man, Alan.
- Yeah.
Well, I'm gonna go wash up, and Look, George, I know this bothers you, but just remember, it wasn't the whole school.
It was just a couple of kids.
Well, you're right.
But it really bothers me.
George.
What's going on here?
Oh, well, we've had a wild toga party, Mr. Turner.
Sorry we didn't invite you.
I heard this rumor you're retiring.
What is that all about?
Yes, well, I have worked hard for many years, and this just feels like, right, now.
Oh, my God.
To finally have time to garden.
To read a good book, to travel, to do all the things that I love.
George, you love teaching.
Come on.
Don't give these goons the power to change your life.
You don't garden, do you, Jonathan?
No.
But I can see where that toilet-paper plant would come in handy sometimes.
I'm surrounded by funny men.
I'm sorry, George.
Here in the garden, at the end of each season, you see the results of the seeds that you planted.
And even in a particularly bad season there is still growth.
So, Mr. Turner, sorry, but I must admit, these days I quite prefer the garden.
Well, can you see it?
Huh?
Your little boy's in love.
Oh, really?
What's this one's name?
Brenda.
Brenda Marsh.
Oh, that's funny, 'cause I work with a Brenda Marsh.
Eric, no.
You can't date Brenda Marsh.
It's 'cause she's Canadian, right?
No, 'cause she's older than you.
An older woman, huh?
An older foreign woman.
Alan, Eric cannot go out with her.
I was setting her up with Jonathan.
Hey, now, she showed up and he didn't.
Finders keepers, losers weepers.
Wait, wait, wait.
Now, if your mother says you can't date Brenda Marsh, then you can't date Brenda Marsh.
- How old is she?
- 27.
Oh, well, in that case, well, you can't date her a lot!
- Alan!
- What?
She is too old for Eric.
Honey, hold on a sec, now.
How old are you now?
24?
25?
40?
- 18.
- No!
Guys, guys, guys, guys.
I mean, come on.
She's OK with it, I'm OK with it When two mature adults make a connection Oh, come on!
You never got me a pony.
Eric, Brenda is older than you, more sophisticated, more experienced.
- Is this making sense?
- Absolutely.
Here's my wallet and my keys.
Wake me when you get in.
He'll be the one on the couch.
This place is, um It's kinda kinda funky.
Yeah, well, I tried to get reservations at that restaurant you like so much.
Oh, ChÃ¢teau du Fond du Lac.
Yeah, OK.
- Did I mention you look lovely tonight?
- Yeah, you did, Eric.
Thanks.
So, tell me, what do you do, uh what do you do when you're not in school?
Do you, uh do you travel?
Are you kidding?
Last summer I bummed my way through Pittsburgh.
- Right.
- I'm serious.
Oh.
Um, ever been to Europe?
No, just Pittsburgh.
But there is a large Polish community there.
Right, right.
You know, I think that you and I are just missing here.
What?
Missing?
Oh, here tonight.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You know, I just realized why the service here's so slow.
They don't have any waiters.
So I'm gonna go up there and I'll order us something to eat.
- Good idea.
- Great.
Matthews, you look sick.
What did you order, so I don't get the same thing?
Mr. Turner, have you ever been to Europe?
Yeah.
Oh, the food here's nothing like it though.
Come here.
Jonathan Turner, Brenda Marsh.
Oh, right.
Hey.
Yeah, from almost the other night.
Right.
All right.
I'm gonna go.
I've gotta study, you know.
Exams.
This guy's tests.
Hey, if you guys hit it off, is this gonna help me with my - No.
- All right.
Just checking.
Eric, hi.
So, Christi, have you ever been to Europe?
No, but during the summer my family's going to Pittsburgh.
Marry me?
OK, so tell me about The Great Gatsby.
The best hockey player of all time.
Next!
- They're at school.
- Who?
Denny and all those other jerks.
They got a bunch of people with them, too.
They're up to something.
Something bad.
- All right, I'm calling the cops.
- No, no, no, no, no.
There's no time.
This is our school.
I'm not turning my back.
I sleep here every day.
Look, Shawn, I know, OK?
But the police are trained in handling unruly crowds.
Come on.
All right.
I'm right behind you.
Denny!
Hey, Hunter, man.
You're just in time.
Dude, here.
Take this can and go craz I don't think so.
Are you gonna stop me?
I didn't think so.
Who is this guy?
Guys!
Come on, why are you doing this?
To show Feeny we're not gonna take his stinking tests.
Oh, yeah we are.
We're gonna go take his stinking tests right off his stinking desk.
Why don't you guys just try studying?
Yeah, well, who needs that stuff Feeny teaches anyway?
It's all about dead old guys like him.
He doesn't teach history, he is history.
He doesn't care about us.
Yeah, of course he cares about you.
I mean, he's trying to push this little nugget of education past your baseball statistics, and your criminal record, right here.
If you touch my head again I will break your finger.
You see?
I learned something.
Well, that's more than you're ever gonna learn from Feeny.
That's not true.
Let me tell you something I learned from Feeny this year.
See, it's cool for you guys to come down to the schoolyard 'cause you've got freedom of assembly.
What are you talking abou I'm talking about Amendment One of the Bill of Rights.
- Shawn?
- I accidentally read the chapter.
Yeah?
What did you learn?
Well, I learned that they've got the right to peaceably assemble.
But the second you guys broke that lock, you broke the law, and I got the right to call the cops.
Why are you defending him?
What has he ever done for you?
- You see those bolt cutters in your hands?
- Yeah, what about them?
- Well, you see I don't have any in mine?
- Yeah.
So?
That's what he's done for me.
Breaking down the door to take your finals, Mr. Burgess?
So, Mr. Hunter, you do listen in class sometimes, hm?
Yeah, well, you know.
Some days you're talking so much I can't really sleep.
Mr. Feeny, what are you doing here so late?
I'm preparing your final exams.
You're not the only ones who work hard on these tests.
I hear Feeny's making them real hard so he can cram some more of that knowledge stuff into our heads.
Oh, if you think these are tough, Mr. Hunter, wait till you see what I have in mind for you next year.
Next year?
Yes, Mr. Matthews.
Perhaps this old dinosaur still has a few hundred million years left in him.
We gotta be out of high school by then.
Oh, Shawn.
I can't look.
C, C, C, C, D. Oh, boy.
Topanga, you did pretty lousy.
- Those are your grades, Shawn.
- Oh!
Yes!
OK.
B, B, B minus, C plus, B. Boy, Cory, you did better than you thought.
You know, this is encouraging.
People, studying really is the way to go.
- Are you guys with me?
- Yeah!
Then follow me!
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Matthews.
Just the man we wanna see.
Don't you guys get enough of me at school?
Yeah, more than.
How would you like to help a couple of teachers hand out some fliers?
- I wouldn't.
- All right, thanks a lot.
Hey, guys, this year's spring dance is a '50s sock hop.
Like anyone would want to go to this.
Topanga, you wanna go to this?
No.
Of course not.
It's me, right?
Just because we're not going out anymore, you don't want to go out anymore.
- What's that about?
- Cory, it's about a decision we've made to just be friends, and I don't think we should complicate that.
Topanga, it's a dance.
In socks.
What's complicated about that?
Cory, you're the one who broke up with me.
Don't you understand that?
Of course I do.
I know exactly where we stand.
And if you're not careful I'll break up with you again.
Cory, you've got to stop living in the past.
- She's right, Cor.
- No, she's not, Shawn.
- Come on.
Are you gonna finish that?
- It's yours, buddy.
Of course it is, because you're my friend and I'm your friend.
That's the way it will always be and there's nothing complicated about that.
- You want my fries?
- Well, only if you're not gonna finish them.
- Hey, what's with this microwave?
- Oh, I unplugged it.
- It's been making this weird sound.
- What kind of weird sound?
No-o-o-o-o-o-o!
Power surge.
My computer crashed.
Somebody plugged something in.
- Here, Morgan, hold this.
- It was me.
I did it.
Dad, my term paper on the space race is gone.
Now I've got to come up with ten pages on Sputnik and I got nothing.
Sputnik was the first satellite.
Launched by the Russians.
1957.
Oh, it was a famous day in history.
It created this big panic because everybody thought that the Russians were putting up a spy satellite.
Yeah.
They were just experimenting, you know, for space travel.
How do you know so much?
You're a grocer.
We're really Russian spies.
Right, Boris?
- Yes, Natasha.
- I heard a scream.
Oh, Mr. Feeny.
Don't expect to get my paper on time.
I never do.
See, the problem is no one understands how hard I have it.
- Oh, forgive us, Mr. Matthews.
- Yeah.
I mean, computer glitches, girlfriend glitches You guys had it so easy going to high school way back in the '50s.
- Um, '70s.
- Late '70s.
I was there, Mr. Matthews.
Communist witch hunts, mass paranoia, people diving under desks for fear the bomb was going to drop.
It wasn't quite the Happy Days you think.
Yeah, well, maybe you didn't have a good time, but I bet I would have.
Hey, Howdy Doody, we're dancing here!
Why did you pull the plug?
Oh, sorry.
Wait a minute.
Topanga.
Is this the sock hop?
Did you decide to come with me?
What are you?
Cracked?
I don't date guys I don't know.
- What do you mean, you don't know?
- Hey, hey, hey!
You zooful of weirdies.
Shake a leg.
Time to get back to school.
Wait a minute.
Where am I?
Excuse me.
- What year is this?
- It's 1957.
What's the matter, kid?
You flip your wig?
It's happened.
I'm here.
Great Caesar's ghost!
I've gone back in time.
It really is the '50s.
This is hunky-dory.
Hey, hey, hey, all right.
You're here too.
Hey, hey, hey.
Don't handle the merchandise unless you intend on paying the price.
Shawn, come on, it's me.
First of all, I don't know who "me" is.
And second of all, it ain't Shawn.
It's Shawnzie.
But, Shawn, we're best friends.
No, see, I don't have any friends.
I'm a loner.
No, you're not, OK?
You just think you are, but deep down you really need a good buddy who's always gonna be there for you.
OK, buddy boy, why don't you hold this?
Ping-Pong, huh?
I love Ping-Pong.
Got a ball?
Shawnzie Hunterelli.
I warned you that your next shenanigan would be your last.
Uh, it wasn't him, it was me.
Ah, a new student trying to make a name for himself, eh?
And that name is?
If he doesn't know you, be smart.
Make one up.
My name is, uh Brad Pitt, sir.
Well, Mr. Pittser.
If you want to keep your nose clean around here, I suggest that you steer clear of bad apples like this Johnny Rottenseed.
Pittser.
You piped up for me when you didn't have to.
We help each other out, I mean, that's what we've always done, Shawn zie.
Well, if I was the type of guy that said thank you, I would.
- You're welcome.
- But I'm not that type of guy.
Young lady, your hair is far too high.
A clear violation of school policy.
And a hazard to all low-flying aircraft.
If I see an aeroplane I'll duck, all right?
And spit out that gum.
Topanga.
There you are.
- Listen, Archie, the name's TL.
- As in Topanga Lawrence.
As in tough luck for suckers who don't know better.
I'm in love.
All right, you guys, I heard a bell, that means everyone into class now.
Come on, it's my first day.
You're gonna make me look bad.
All right, settle, settle.
What does it take to calm you kids down?
Go ahead, Teach, make your mama proud.
Today's topic for discussion - what will life be like in 40 years?
Oh, yes!
OK, who wants to go first?
Young lady, your hair is up.
How about you, Shawnzie?
What do you think life will be like in 40 years?
I don't know.
I don't know what I'm having for lunch.
That was this close to a shenanigan.
- We have a volunteer.
- You bet you do.
I can say with total confidence, a man will walk on the moon, pizza will have cheese baked right into the crust and men and women will be equal partners in the workplace and in their relationships.
What an imagination.
- Tell us more about that pizza.
- That's all I got.
Good enough.
'Cause right now it's time to put on our helmets and practice our civil-defense drills.
The atomic bomb falls, we see a brilliant flash - Now, what do we do?
- We duck and cover.
Correct.
Here we go.
Flash!
You're dead, Brad.
Mr. Turner, you're telling me that if the atomic bomb falls I'll be safe if I go like this?
No, no, no.
You gotta drop to the ground, duck under desk, curl up, cover neck And kiss your butt goodbye.
All right.
Who said that?
Who said uttbay?
I did, Mr. Turner.
I said butt.
That's it.
This time you've gone too far, Hunterelli.
- For saying butt?
- Oh, this one's on me.
- How come?
- It's what we've always done.
Oh.
The ear thing.
Hello, Dean Witter, please.
Speaking?
Yes.
I'd like to buy some Xerox stock.
Never heard of it, huh?
What about IBM?
Selling at a nickel a share.
I'll take 'em all!
Here's my dilemma.
I've been accepted to both Harvard and Yale.
You're my mentor.
What's your advice?
Oh, you'd be a fine student at either institution.
Oh, undoubtedly I would.
But they've asked me to teach.
Well, as you know, Mr. Matthews, there are no females at Harvard.
Well, I wouldn't want anything to distract me from my intellectual pursuits.
Harvard it is.
Ah, young Pittser.
- Enjoying your first day?
- Oh, yes, I am, thank you.
- But about Shawnzie - Why?
Mr. Feeny, why?
Why are you sending Shawnzie off to reform school?
He'll rot in there, I tell you.
Rot, rot, rot!
Yeah.
Can't you give him another chance?
Mr. Hunterelli has run out of chances.
And as for you, missy, I suggest you mend your wayward ways and spit out that gum.
Man.
You know, things aren't as perfect around here as I thought they'd be.
Well, I say we blow this dump and head down to Slim's and grab a burger.
I got a better idea.
How about we go to the zoo and see the giraffes?
And why would I want to do a thing like that, huh?
And after the zoo we can get some Rocky Road ice cream.
Hey, who do you think you are thinking I like them giraffes and Rocky Road ice cream out of nowhere like this, huh?
Topanga, I know you better than anybody.
I told you.
Quit calling me Topanga.
And stop looking at me like that.
You're giving me the heebie-jeebies.
Everyone, quiet.
I have dire news.
The Russians have launched a satellite.
Our government believes it to be a spy satellite with an atomic warhead.
Flash!
Russian satellite, 1957?
Hey, guys, guys, relax, OK?
It's only Sputnik.
Sputnik?
Yeah.
My parents told me all about it.
It's not a bomb and it's not for spying.
The Russians are just doing some space-travel experiments.
- Are they?
- Yeah.
And this arms-race thing, trust me, where I'm from, no one even worries about it.
Where would that be, Mr. Pittser?
Moscow?
Grab that boy!
Bradley Pittser's a spy.
- Eric, please.
I'm your brother.
- Yeah, comrade, you mean.
Doesn't take a Harvard genius and future captain of industry like myself to realize you're a traitor to these United States.
Flash!
All right, that spy couldn't have gotten far.
All clear.
That was right there.
Perfect aim.
Come on, you two, we gotta scram before that bunch comes back.
- Yeah, but they'll recognize me.
- Not in this clever disguise they won't.
So, why'd you want to come here?
'Cause this is my home and whenever things get crazy this is the one place I can count on.
Why?
Is this the secret headquarters for you and the rest of the Russian spies?
I'm not a Russian spy.
Hey, hey.
Whatever.
Friends don't need to explain nothing.
- I thought you didn't have friends.
- I didn't.
Now I do.
So, TL, I guess this is goodbye, huh?
I thought I told you not to look at me like that.
Sorry.
I just can't help it.
Come on, you can find one Russian spy.
You're Harvard-trained dogs.
Mom?
Dad?
Yes!
Homemade brownies.
OK, everything's gonna be all right.
Uh, uh, uh.
Mom said no one can touch those brownies till after dinner.
- Morgan, where's Mom and Dad?
- Mom's out, but Dad's upstairs.
Hey, kids.
- Daddy!
- Hi, kitten.
Hi, son.
- Here.
Here's your allowance.
- But I'm not your son.
Well, then give me back my dime.
You know what?
I bet that's my dad.
- Dad!
- No.
Anson Williams.
- Wait a minute, you're - No.
Anson Williams.
Like I said I was.
Anson Williams.
Whoever you think I was, let's just drop it, all right?
Just calm down, young fella, and have a nice brownie, huh?
Oh, thanks, Mr. B. What's the matter with you, son?
You look like you lost something.
I have.
My entire life.
I can cheer you up.
You know, when I was down in the dumps my parents used to say Come to think of it I didn't have any parents.
Not even a house.
I hung out at other people's houses.
Not bad, really.
- Oh, Daddy, dearest.
- Yes, snowflake.
There's something you've gotta see.
It's not true.
Of course it's not.
FBI?
J Edgar Hoover, please.
J Edgar?
Tom.
Yeah, I'm here with Anson Williams and a Russian spy.
Ixnay on the otsiepay.
You're going to jail, spy.
Now, now, Morgan.
He may be a Russian spy, but until they come and haul him off, he's still our guest.
You don't understand, copper.
I'm not a Russian spy.
This is my country.
I'm from these here United States.
Hey, spy, you got visitors.
- Claim to be your folks.
- Mom!
Dad!
Please, tell him you know me.
Well, of course we do, don't we, Alan?
Well, I think we'd know our own son, Amy.
You see, their own son, finally.
I got to tell you guys, this nightmare was getting way out of hand.
Do you have the papers?
- Papers?
- On the American space program.
What?
You mean my term paper?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Why are you guys talking like Boris and Natasha?
Good.
He knows our secret code names.
Here.
Take muffin.
Oh, I get it.
It contains a secret transmitter.
During the night you'll contact me and break me out.
No, bubele, it is to eat.
You are too thin.
You need to be strong for when they savagely torture you.
And if they don't, of course, our people will.
I'm not seeing any upside here.
Oh, no!
It's the big one!
Duck and take cover!
You guys set off the alarm?
- Yes.
- Now, come on!
Let's get off of this rock.
Well, what about the FBI?
They'll recognize me.
Not in this clever chicken disguise, they won't.
Just cluck a lot and blend.
You'll you'll be safe here in my make-out pad.
It's been abandoned for years.
Well, what girl would come to make out here?
And it's rent-controlled.
So.
How did you get into the spy racket?
I'm not a Russian spy, OK?
My name is Cory Matthews.
I'm from the future.
And I can prove it.
My mom sews my name into my underwear.
I'll take a look.
"Eric Matthews"?
Oh, this day just keeps getting worse and worse.
Look.
Whoever you are, wherever you're from, it doesn't really matter.
What matters is that you're here.
What was that for?
I like to go to the zoo and look at the giraffes.
And sometimes at night when my friends are all out on dates, but I'm not because I haven't found that right boy yet, I drown my sorrows in a bowl of Rocky Road ice cream.
- Do me a favor, would you?
- Anything you want.
Would you look at me that way I don't like?
I thought you said it scared you?
It does.
We interrupt this program to bring you this news flash.
The manhunt for teenage fugitive spy, Brad Pittser, continues.
The Coast Guard's on alert.
You know, I don't understand it here.
Where I'm from, we're not so worried about bombs and satellites and Russian spies.
I mean, there are problems, sure, but most of the people get along.
It's pretty good where I'm from.
I mean, better than I thought.
Now, all I want to do is go back.
Isn't there some way out of here?
- Wise man?
- Wise man.
Wise man?
Excuse me, Mr. Wise Man?
I am playing a song, man.
All right, now I'm finished.
- Wait a minute.
You're the wise man?
- No, I am clearly the hepcat.
Now, that there is the wise man.
Yo, Mr. Wise Man.
Um Our friend here is in a lot of trouble and we figure that you're the only one Wise man see young boy in trouble now wants to go back.
Ah.
Young boy name Matthews.
Amazing.
- So can you help me?
- How did you get here?
Well, the last thing I remember I was plugging in the microwave and I must have gotten a shock or something.
Wise man says best way out is the way you came in.
- Huh?
- Huh?
Get another microwave oven and give yourself another shock.
Listen, I ain't got time for all this.
I got customers.
Look, are you guys gonna order something or are you gonna sit here all day?
- Wait a minute.
He works here?
- Hey, wise man gotta make a living.
Another shock.
Why didn't I think of that?
You did.
This is your fantasy.
Well, I know you've gotta go back, but I sure hate to lose a friend like you.
You won't.
I mean I-I think we could be friends just about anytime.
So.
I guess this is really goodbye, huh?
Yeah, I think so.
'Cause, you know, if you stayed I could really make it worth your while.
Could you hold that thought for about 40 years?
Oh, heck, you'll never find out about this anyway.
OK.
I gotta get out of here.
Wait a minute.
It's 1957.
There is no microwave.
Oopsy.
What kind of wise man says oopsy?
What do you want me to say?
Wax on, wax off?
- There he is!
- Another A plus, Mr. Matthews.
- Spy!
Spy!
- No!
I'm Cory!
- Spy!
Spy!
- I'm Cory!
I'm Cory!
I'm Cory!
- Spy!
Spy!
- I'm Cory!
I'm Cory!
- Spy!
Spy!
Spy!
Spy!
- Cory.
Cory.
Cory.
- Cory, honey, are you all right?
- I'm not Brad Pitt.
I'm not Brad Pitt!
Well, duh!
Easy, easy, pal.
You had quite a jolt there.
- Yeah, you were out cold.
- Shawnzie?
Yes-y?
You're always there for me, aren't you?
Hey.
What are you looking for, Cor?
She's here.
I know she's here.
Hey, I got you some more ice.
Are you OK?
Why are you looking at me like that?
I will always look at you like this.
- Well, stop.
- Why?
Because you're giving me the heebie-jeebies.
Good.
Eric.
I'm almost done with my term paper on the space program.
You'll be all done if you don't plug that in.
The batteries are low, man.
Oh, wait.
Eric, Eric, thank you.
You saved my life.
Uh-oh.
Not again.
Where am I?
- Cory, are you OK?
- Yeah.
Still here.
Good.
Well, let's keep it that way.
They know me.
No foreign accents.
Everything's gonna be A-OK.
Mr. Matthews.
You know, you're in my kitchen dressed in a spacesuit.
Bridge, Captain Feeny here.
I have located the earth alien and I will be escorting him back to the mother ship.
- Mr. Feeny, earth alien?
I'm - Beam us up.
Sure.
Go ahead.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Shawn.
Shawn.
Come on.
We're gonna be late for class.
Hold on.
I'm trying to check my messages.
Hey, John.
What's your secret code?
Oh, it's one, four, three, four.
Matthews, how do you know my secret code?
Easy, it's the same number as your bank card.
Oh.
I owe you 40 bucks.
Well, no messages.
My dad hasn't called in two weeks now.
I wouldn't worry too much, Shawn.
Could be a million good reasons.
Yeah.
Didn't he say he was on his way to the Vatican to visit his old friend the Pope?
- Yeah.
- Well, they only have one phone there and it's in the Pope's bedroom.
And you don't want to go in there.
It was just after his last letter, I thought he was headed this way.
I was hoping to get to see him, that's all.
Mr. Turner, we got a big problem with Shawn.
I mean, this one goes way beyond pooberty.
You mean puberty.
Yeah.
Pooberty.
Listen, you gotta get Shawn's dad out here for at least a visit.
I mean, he hasn't seen him since he took off after his mom.
And that was, like, a year ago.
I don't think he's coming back real soon, Matthews.
Why do you say that?
Well, because Chet's calls are getting fewer and far between.
And a few months back he sent me the paperwork to make me Shawn's legal guardian.
Wow.
No wonder Shawn's been so bummed out lately.
It's a big step for him.
And for me.
I mean, it's difficult enough just living together in that mousehole of an apartment.
Mr. Turner, you gotta do something.
Yeah, I do.
You know what?
You're a good guy.
- Here's the 30 bucks I owe you.
- 40.
That's a good memory.
I'm just saying I didn't like any of the apartments we saw.
- Be specific.
- OK.
The first one?
Absolutely no furniture.
Shawn, it was an unfurnished apartment.
- Thank you.
- Shawn, why are you being so difficult?
I'm not being so difficult.
You know, I didn't mind the nice duplex in the condo community, but you said that it was too expensive.
Good news!
The duplex in the condo community?
I talked him down.
And look what they're throwing in.
Carpets.
Now, my advice is to go shag 'cause it feels good between your toes.
What is wrong with right here?
I mean, look.
There's furniture everywhere.
And the neighbors - the best.
Wonderful people who mind their own business.
Hey, Mrs. Dubchek, can you quit looking at me like that?
Eli, what's going on?
Remember when Mrs. Dubchek's husband died?
And she said she'd never look at another man?
Well, she's over him.
And I'm scared.
Why?
You know, you could do worse than Mrs. Dubchek.
In fact, I've seen you do worse than Mrs. Dubchek.
This building's gonna miss that wit when you're gone.
- And when is that happy day, huh?
- As soon as Shawn finds a place he likes.
You know, since everybody's talking about me like I'm not here, I might as well not be here.
Let me know how things turn out.
Look, Mr. Turner, I know Shawn's a little antsy about this, but this idea of yours, moving into a new apartment, I think it's brilliant.
Shawn!
Wait up!
I got some linoleums that'll knock your socks off.
Mr. Matthews.
How I love the energy of a rededicated and enthusiastic senior.
Off to class, eh?
Lunch.
You know, it wouldn't be a bad idea if you took some of that pep into the classroom.
Well, you start serving mashed taters, maybe I will.
I'll take it under consideration.
Now, while you're here, I have your paper on European monarchies.
- A D?
- Yes.
Oh, Mr. Feeny.
I worked really hard on this.
Where'd I go wrong?
I'd have to say the fifth grade, when you took that ride in the dryer.
Yeah, but if it wasn't for that my hair would still look like Cory's.
Come on.
Mr. Feeny, you know how hard I've been working lately.
This grade's gonna kill my average.
Can I do another paper?
I have a better idea.
Tutoring.
I thought all the tutors got together and agreed to never work with me again.
Oh, indeed they did.
My thought was to make you a tutor.
Mr. Feeny, when'd you take your ride in the dryer?
- Do you know Jeff Lacy?
- Yeah, he's a guard in the basketball team.
Mr. Lacy has athletic scholarship offers to 20 colleges, but he needs at least a C average to get in.
OK.
So I tutor this kid, help him get into college, he turns pro, makes millions What do I get out of this?
The joy of helping someone learn.
But no money.
You get used to it.
- So?
Did you decide yet?
- About what?
The condo.
Now, look, I just got off the phone with the landlord.
There was another offer made, but I did a little dancing, I bought us another half-day.
- But you can't keep us hanging.
- "Us"?
Cory, what's in this for you?
Well, if I rent ten places, I get a cruise.
Cory, there's not gonna be any move.
Why?
What's going on?
I've been moving around ever since I was little kid.
I'm sick of it.
I don't want to do it anymore.
So I just want the next move to be the last one.
Yeah, but Turner's doing this for you.
I mean, he's a great friend.
Yeah.
A friend.
John, this does not taste like chicken Ã  I'orange.
You didn't use Tang, did you?
Eli, I said taste it, not suck the meat off the bone.
Somebody's got their apron on a little too tight.
What's with you?
Well, I spoke to an attorney today.
Guess what?
- In 48 hours I'm Shawn's legal guardian.
- Whoa.
Been on the fence about that one for a while.
You know, it's what he needs, man.
Besides, I've come this far, I might as well go the distance, you know?
Well, something like that'll change your life forever, man.
- What'll change your life forever?
- See you guys later.
Hey, Shawn, I thought you were eating dinner over at the Matthews.
Yeah, I was, but I'm tired.
I wanted to turn in early.
Chicken Ã  la Tang.
- What's the special occasion?
- Well, I got a date.
But, hey, you know, I can easily stretch this three ways.
Hey, - I finally got another letter from my dad.
- Where is he now?
He's still in that truck stop in Reading.
What did you do that for?
It's 50 miles from here, John.
I mean, the least he could do is come visit me.
Hey, you know, Shawn, I spoke to an attorney today.
A couple of signatures and I'm your legal guardian.
I thought you did that months ago.
Well, I got the forms, I just never got around to filling them out.
"Got around to filling them out"?
I'm so sorry my life didn't fit into your busy schedule.
Whoa, whoa, Shawn.
Hey, cut me some slack.
I'm just trying to do the right thing.
Yeah.
Yeah, I know you are.
Hey, enjoy your date.
All right, Jeff.
Here's an easy one.
Now, who was the king of France before Louis XIV?
I'm not following.
Come on, Jeff.
This stuff's definitely gonna be on the test.
Now it's Louis the King?
All right, last minute of play.
You answer one question, we win the big game.
- Go, baby.
- OK.
- Jeff, is that your Porsche out front?
- Yes!
We win.
You care for a little ride, ladies?
Hey, Jeff, come on.
Look away.
Studying.
Is that all you straight-C students think about?
No, but I promised Feeny.
Besides, you can't fit four people in a Porsche.
We can if the girls sit on your lap.
Break time.
All right, Jeff.
Who painted the Sistine Chapel?
- Michelangelo.
- Jeff!
Nah, just kidding.
Who?
What a waste of a night.
I just spent three hours speeding around in a Porsche with a pretty girl in my lap.
- I hate when that happens.
- Who do you know that has a Porsche?
Oh, you didn't hear?
The school's all-American point guard is being tutored by the school's all-American cheesehead.
- Cory, get the phone.
- I didn't hear it ringing.
- I'll get it.
- Eric, a tutor.
I'm proud, yet confused.
Can we be sued?
Hi, Mrs. Matthews, Mr. Matthews.
- Can you guys leave?
- No.
- Dang.
I need another plan.
- Shawn, let's just go outside.
Man, you are good on your feet.
Cory, now that your parents have left the room, I gotta ask you something.
What are you doing tonight?
Well, I'm showing a three bedroom at 7:30, but after then I'm free as a bird.
- Cool, 'cause we're going to see my dad.
- What?
You know where he is?
Yeah, he's staying at this truck stop in Reading.
And by motorcycle that's less than an hour away.
I'm there.
But can Turner get us both on the back of his bike?
Turner's not coming.
It's just you and me.
No, forget it, Shawn.
Count me out.
Oh, come on.
It's just a little field trip.
What's the worst thing that could possibly happen?
You get one phone call.
You guys really say that, huh?
Nice way to spend a date.
A little dinner, a little wine, a little prison.
Hey, at least you got dinner.
Shawn, that was a stupid, dangerous stunt you pulled.
What if you'd have lost control of the bike?
- I didn't.
- Yeah, but, Shawn, what if you had?
- But I didn't.
- You could've hurt someone and I'd be legally responsible.
Oh, so that's why you're so upset.
You don't want to be legally responsible for me.
That's a cheap shot and you know it.
Yeah?
Then why'd you take your sweet time to file for guardianship?
- Is that what this is about?
- It's what everything's about, John.
It's my life.
I mean, you've got your life, my dad's got his life, I I just feel like I've got nothing.
Shawn, if you'd have wanted to see your dad, I could've taken you.
It's it's more than that, John.
I'm I'm just tired of feeling like a guest wherever I go.
I know.
I know.
Look, Shawn, this hasn't been the easiest year for me either, you know.
I mean, going from a single guy to raising a 15 year old was not on my to-do list.
Great.
So we're both on each other's nerves.
Well, I don't know, Shawn.
I mean, I offered to get us a bigger place, you don't want any part of it.
Yeah, well, you've had the guardianship papers for months and you still haven't filled them out yet.
I don't know, maybe maybe we're both afraid to make this living arrangement permanent.
Yeah.
Maybe we are.
Got it.
Got it.
Good news, Cor.
Shawn, there's no such thing as good news before I've had my Grape-Nuts.
I'm just gonna store some stuff here until I settle in.
- Settle in?
- Yeah.
I'm moving back to the trailer park.
What?
Your dad found your mom and they're moving back?
No, I'm moving into Uncle Mike's trailer.
- Are you sure about that?
- Yeah.
I just don't know why I didn't think of this a long time ago.
Yeah, but, Shawn, I mean, you said you were only gonna make one more move and it had to be the right one.
Look, I can't keep waiting for my dad to come home.
I gotta get on with my life.
At least at the trailer park I'll be surrounded by family.
And the FBI agents who surround them.
- Ah, our son the tutor.
- So how was studying with Jeff?
Nag, nag, nag.
What are you?
My mom?
- Yes.
And what a joy it is.
- Oh I'm sorry, Mom.
I shouldn't take all my anger out on you.
That's what Cory's for.
Cory!
Eric, what's the problem?
Dad, I recite the entire history of Europe to this kid, from Henry IV's Edict of Nantes to Talleyrand and the Treaty of Vienna.
You know what he says to me?
He says, "I can burp through my ears.
" - And then he does it.
- Well, at least you tried.
You know what gets me?
This kid's got 20 colleges begging him to come there and I can't get into one.
Eric, you will get into college, and you will have earned it.
You know, maybe Jeff's onto something.
Maybe I have, like, an untapped talent that could guide me through life, huh?
Apple, sink, he shoots He sucks.
He pays.
Ear burps it is, then.
You know, Mom, Dad, when Eric's off to college that big old room of ours is gonna seem mighty lonely.
- What's your angle?
- Shawn needs a new place to live.
What?
He's not happy at Mr. Turner's?
How could he be?
It's not really his home.
Well, you know there's always room for Shawn here, but this wouldn't be his home.
It'd still be just another temporary solution.
I think what Shawn needs is something permanent.
What does Shawn's dad have to say about this?
Who knows?
I mean, no one talks in that family.
Well, I know if Shawn were my son I'd like to be consulted about his future.
OK, Topanga.
Just act natural and try and fit in.
OK.
But I'm not going to spit.
I don't see Shawn's dad anywhere.
- OK, let's go.
Maybe the bus is still here.
- No!
No.
We're on a mission.
Now cover me.
Oh, I really hope I don't have to use the bathroom.
Gentlemen.
Now that I've broken the ice, anyone here know a guy named Chet Hunter?
You know, I did forget to chalk my nose before I left the house.
Thank you, sir.
I don't care if you're having a good time, I am sick of watching you shoot pool all night.
If you're not gonna treat me like a desirable woman then I will just find me a man that can.
What about you, mister?
You look like a man who knows how to treat a woman right.
Oh, tingle.
- Do you know how to dance?
- Teach me?
Please?
Cory, what are you doing?
Well, I'm trying to see what this woman knows.
Which I'm thinking is an awful lot.
Do you really think this is a productive use of our time?
Oh, absolutely.
Hey, I found him first.
Don't make me laugh.
- Would you like to step outside?
- Yeah, I would.
Oh, this is great.
Lord love a duck.
Is that who I think it is?
Yeah.
Mr. Hunter, it's me.
Cory Matthews.
Oh.
Sorry.
My mistake.
- No.
No, I'm Shawn's friend.
- Oh, right.
Right.
How you been?
- Step into my office.
Pie?
- Oh, no, thanks.
No, I'm asking you do you think it's pie?
I got it out of the dirties.
Either apple brown betty or some kind of dim sum.
So, uh, are you working here?
Just till I pay off some parking tickets.
Then back out on the road, looking for my lovely wife, Virna.
- You ever been married?
- Oh, I'm 15.
Now, now, now.
Don't you give up hope.
Virna and I were 16 before we got hitched.
She wanted to wait till she got out of the navy.
So, CortÃ©s, what brings you up here?
Well, I actually came to talk to you about Shawn.
- Why?
Is he sick?
- No.
No, no.
He's just all confused.
And well, I think he really misses you.
Well, I miss him too.
He's a good boy.
Then come back for him.
- He needs you there.
- No.
Shawn'll be better off where he is.
Turner sends me his report cards and his tests.
He even sent me a picture of him and that new girlfriend of his.
Reminds me of his mom.
About a thousand years ago.
But, see, Shawn needs family in his life.
- And that's you.
- Come on, son.
Shawn's better off where he is now than he ever could be with a man like me.
Mr. Turner's great and all, OK?
But he's his friend.
He's not his father.
You are.
And, with all due respect, if you love him, Mr. Hunter, then you'd come back for him.
I love him.
I love him so much I can't go back.
But you, uh you tell Shawn his daddy said hey.
If you teased that hair I bet you'd be six feet tall.
OK, Louanne.
Let's do it.
Lamb chop, you have another cup of coffee.
This may take a while.
- Uh, Mr. Feeny?
- Hm?
You know, before you grade the midterms, - I just wanna - I already have, Mr. Matthews.
Mr. Feeny, I just want you to know that I worked really hard with Jeff, but you know better than anybody else that you can't teach somebody if they don't want to learn.
Well, how do you explain this?
- You gave Jeff a C plus?
- No, no.
You did.
I don't know what to say.
I thought the guy was a total lost cause.
I don't believe in lost causes.
- I think this is yours.
- Oh.
Wait, Mr. Feeny.
You didn't finish your sentence here.
You just put "A ".
"A " what?
That's your grade, Eric.
It is?
It is!
Mr. Feeny, as I stand here in front of you, my fellow students, the entire faculty, I must say that Oh, give it up, man.
It's just one test.
However, congratulations.
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Mr. Feeny.
This was your plan all along?
I teach Jeff, but really I teach myself?
He does better, I do better?
Mr. Feeny, you sly, sly dog.
Got lucky on that one.
Thanks, Mike.
Hey, I'm glad to see that promotion came through for you.
- Dad?
- Shawn?
What are you doing here?
Well, I guess I could ask you the same thing.
Evening, officer.
Hey, here's a hint, son.
Whenever you find yourself in custody, smile.
Nobody ever billy clubbed a happy man.
So, Dad.
Long time.
You look good.
- Well, right back at you.
- How'd you ever find me here?
Better question.
How'd you find yourself here?
Well, uh, I moved out of Turner's.
I was gonna move in with Uncle Mike, but his trailer's gone.
So a cop found me sleeping in the park and brought me here.
Hey, did they turn on the swirly lights when they brought you in?
That's always fun.
- So, uh so any luck finding Mom?
- Well, I saw her a couple of months ago.
Had her cornered in Mississippi, but she dove off the riverboat.
Woman swims like a seal.
Dad, how long are you gonna keep chasing her?
I just wanna give her enough time to clear her head.
- It's been a year.
- Woman's got a big head.
- Come on, who are you kidding?
- Yeah, I suppose you're right.
If your mama wanted me to catch her, well, she'd be caught.
So, uh so what's next?
What's next is we get you out of here and back to Turner's, where you belong.
Dad, you know, I was thinking, maybe you could stick around here for a while.
There ain't nothing in this town for me.
Yeah there is.
Me.
Shawn, I left you at Turner's because in my mind it was a better place.
And it was a good place, Dad, but I wouldn't call it better.
It wasn't with you.
It wasn't home.
- I don't know, Shawn.
- Come on, Dad.
I'm right here.
No chasing.
Besides I need you.
And I'm thinking you need me.
Well, if you remember, I ain't much of a cook.
- Can't be any worse than Mom.
- Ain't that the truth.
Shawn, I'm gonna do something I haven't done since you were a very little boy.
- Get a job?
- Heck, no.
Something better.
Hunter.
- You've been bailed.
- Which one?
- Little one.
- All right, Shawn.
Chet?
Look at me, Teach.
I'm a bad seed.
I was on my way to your place when I ran into a speed trap and a pile of unpaid parking tickets.
Yeah, so let me guess who's bailing you out.
Well, I'd be much obliged.
I gotta get outta here so I can take care of my boy.
- What do you mean?
- I mean I'm staying.
Wouldn't be much of a father if I didn't, would I?
- Your job's done.
- Hey, Shawn?
Dad, can I talk to John alone for a minute?
Sure.
I'd step outside, but they'd shoot me.
Hey, Shawn, I don't even need to ask.
I can tell this is what you want.
You know, John, this is like we said.
We knew that this wasn't forever.
- Hey, a roof and a bed.
- And a good friend.
The best.
Thanks.
I owe you.
You put up with a lot.
I'd do it again.
OK, Shawn, I'll meet you downstairs.
One more parking ticket and our home gets the Denver boot.
Hey, you kids, get off my front porch.
- Well, Cor, wish me luck.
- You got it.
Hey, you know, my dad told me about how you tracked him down and everything.
Shawn, we're friends.
I mean, we help each other out.
That's what we do.
You know what I've wanted to do for a long time, Cor?
Invite you to my house for dinner.
- Well, who's cooking?
- You are.
Huh.
I'm there.
OK, that's just about it.
Dad, that's Mr. Turner's TV.
Well, heck.
You've been here a year.
Besides, teachers shouldn't be watching television anyway.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
You know, Kristen, I don't mind paying Chubbie that $3 cover charge if it means I can do this.
Watch me now, hey I said-a work it all, baby Ah, you're drivin' me crazy Cory.
I'm so flattered you found the time to go out with me.
I mean, the whole school knows since you've been single you've been out with a different girl every night.
Well, I had to get 'em all out of the way to make time for a fetching gal like you.
And how do I know that's not just another line from the new Cory Matthews?
Lines?
I have no lines.
'Cause your pretty blue eyes leave me speechless.
So, what else is the school saying about me?
They say just before you kiss a girl you pass a fry from knuckle to knuckle.
Huh.
That's interesting.
That was nice, Cory.
It sure was, Topanga.
You just called me Topanga.
Oh, boy.
You called her Topanga?
Now, Shawn, it's so obvious what's going on here.
Yeah, you're really bad with names.
Do what I do, write them on the palm of your hand, Cory.
No, no.
The problem is no matter how many girls I go out with, I still end up thinking about Topanga.
So why did you break up with her in the first place?
I don't know.
I mean, I made a mistake.
I thought we could be friends like you and I are.
But, you know, when I see Topanga I want to hug her, hold her, kiss her.
When I see you I have no interest in any of those things.
Well, so how do you think she feels about you?
I will ask.
- Hey, Topanga.
- Hi, Cory.
- She wants back.
- All right, you guys.
Remember the papers for the Environmental Essay Awards I had you write at the beginning of the year?
Oh, yeah.
I finished mine last night, Mr. Turner.
Enter this puppy.
And here are the winners.
On their way to Walt Disney World in Orlando are the following students.
Kristen Hoffman.
That's good for her, you know?
A week in Florida, a little sun, a little color, a little ocean air could help her get over me.
Ronnie Waterman.
Well, she'll get over you quickly enough with Lips Waterman on the same trip.
Perfect.
Kristen with Lips in Florida.
And me free to spend the next week romancing Topanga.
You know what, Shawn?
Sometimes everything in my life just seems to go my way.
And our last winner is Topanga Lawrence.
I hate my stinking life.
Hey, Ronnie, you think this ride is safe?
I mean, what if my hair gets caught in the rotor?
Your hair is safe.
But your lips they're in danger.
No, Lips!
No, Lips!
Cory.
Are you having that nightmare again where you're kidnapped by figure skaters and forced to do compulsories against your will?
No, I only have that dream every four years.
Eric, look.
I'm in a bad way.
I need your advice.
You love Topanga and you want her back.
That's brilliant.
So very insightful.
How did you know?
Oh.
Look, Eric, ever since I broke up with Topanga I- I-I've got this gnawing in the pit of my stomach that just won't go away.
Your poor little body goes through so much.
Look, why don't you just tell her how you feel and let me go back to bed, all right?
I can't.
I mean, she's going out of town.
She won some trip to Walt Disney World.
Then, Cor, I gotta say, go to Florida.
Immediately.
Win back your woman.
Just like that?
Go to Florida?
That's insane.
What about sunscreen?
I have spoken.
Eric, I'm doing it.
I'm taking your advice.
I'm going to Florida to get back the woman I love.
- I'm proud of you, Cor.
- All right, you think you can cover for me?
- I am way ahead of you.
- Why?
What's in the bag?
You.
It's like looking into a mirror, huh?
Eric, you'd have to be the biggest idiot on the planet to actually think that's me.
Hey, Eric.
Hey, Cor.
Argh!
Boy, you really went to a lot of trouble for me.
Well, I figured you're my only brother.
It's not gonna kill me to show a little affection.
All right.
Now, all I gotta do is spend all the money I have and buy a plane ticket.
Oh, I got tickets.
From my Uncle Nicky.
Wait.
Your uncle who's in the "gaming industry"?
Yeah, yeah, and there's a slight chance we may have to break someone's knees while we're there.
Wait, "we"?
You're coming too?
Of course.
I figure all the times you've been there for me, I at least owe you one.
Thanks, man.
Maybe if I tell Topanga how I feel before she leaves, we won't have to do this whole thing.
- Uh, Topanga.
- Cory, hi.
Isn't this exciting?
I'm on my way to Florida.
Yeah.
Um Look, I'll get right to it.
You and me, we've been apart for three months now, you know, and Well, I don't know about you, but I've still got all these feelings for you.
I have feelings for you too, Cory.
That's why we're always going to be friends, right?
Well, yeah, but, come on, tell me you haven't thought about us getting back together.
Well, yeah, I've thought about it, but, I mean, it's really hard for me to trust you when this new Cory Matthews is running around dating all those other girls.
I- I went out with those other girls because I hated being alone, but even with them I was still alone because I wasn't with you.
Cory, that's really sweet.
Hey, Topanga.
Is this yours?
Yeah.
It's my carry-on of hair products.
I'll be right back.
Cory, I thought about the other night.
I was silly to run away.
No.
No.
Running away was good.
You should have run further.
You're such a gentleman.
That's why, when I get back from Florida I want to make things work between us.
"I was still alone because I wasn't with you.
" You know, Topanga, apparently you're not seeing the humor here, which is surprising.
Laugh.
Go ahead, laugh with me.
Cory, you know what I see?
You in a robe, wearing slippers, smoking a pipe.
- Wha?
- Cory Matthews, you're a a playboy!
Window or aisle seat?
Hi, everyone.
Hi.
I'm Alexandra Morris.
I'd like to welcome you to the Living Seas Pavilion.
For the next week, we're gonna be studying and observing dolphins.
Right out here.
Oh, my gosh.
Come on, I'll show you where they play.
Didn't I tell you my Uncle Nicky would take care of our travel arrangements?
We took a cargo plane, Shawn.
I sat next to a crate of live chickens.
You see this?
Peck marks.
Oh, come on, Cor.
We're here.
"The happiest place on earth.
" Yeah?
Then why am I so miserable?
You gotta do what you came here to do.
Find Topanga and tell her you still love her.
I know.
I mean, she's the most wonderful thing that ever happened to me.
How can I not have her in my life?
Shawn, there's tens of thousands of people.
You know?
I mean, we got this much chance of finding her.
Well, we better get started.
It could take days.
Oh, and excellent oral report, Cory Matthews.
Thank you.
OK.
We've got a five minute break now, Cor, and then we've got gym.
So come on.
Here we Don't struggle.
Get in there.
There we go.
All right.
- Mr. Matthews, what are you doing?
- I just put my books away.
I thought I saw you stuff your brother into your locker.
Now, why would I want to go do something like that?
I don't know.
But I clearly saw a curly-haired boy enter your locker.
Why would I want a curly-haired boy in my locker?
Again, I don't know.
Now, get him out of there.
George, can I grab a word with you a second?
Mr. Turner, I'm busy right now, but I'll be with you in a minute.
There's no Cory in here.
Do you think I'm a dummy, Mr. Matthews?
No.
Not you.
I'll see you in detention.
Shawn, we've been standing in this line for over a half an hour.
- Now, Topanga better be on this ride.
- Who said anything about a ride?
- Churro?
- Are you kidding me?
Come on, let's go.
We talk about communicating with dolphins.
The truth is we don't speak their language.
But we certainly understand their emotions.
This is Amber.
She was found beached.
We brought her here to nurse her back to health, but because she's been separated from her family and, quite possibly, her mate, she spends her time alone and, most distressing, she's lost her appetite and won't take food.
- Well, what's gonna happen?
- I don't know.
But I'm hoping she's reunited with her mate real soon.
- Shawn, I have a feeling Topanga's here.
- Why?
Because we've looked everywhere else.
Brilliant!
There she is.
Look at her.
She's so beautiful.
You know what?
I'm just gonna go over there and tell her that I love her.
I mean, that I've loved her since the day our eyes met and that I will love her till the day I die.
And what do you think she's gonna say when she hears that?
- I love you too, Cory.
- Exactly.
- Kristen.
- Coming all the way to Florida for me.
That's so romantic.
- No, you don't understand.
- Oh, but I do.
Oh, boy.
Oh.
Ow.
My back.
Every disk out of whack.
Major pain.
Oh!
Best night's sleep I ever had.
You think they sell these at the gift shop?
A thousand miles away from home.
I didn't get the girl I came for and I slept in a log.
You know what that makes me, Shawn?
A log-sleeping loser.
You know, I was just fooling myself thinking there's still a spark between me and Topanga.
Come on.
Let's go home.
- OK.
- Shawn!
My heart's been skewered and you're not gonna talk me into staying?
Well, why?
You gave it your best shot.
Clearly she's more interested in Ronnie Waterman.
Wait a second.
I have something to offer her.
Passion.
Deep passion and a history.
Shawn, I came here to woo her and, by gum, woo her I will.
- So we're staying then?
- Of course we're staying.
Oh.
I see what you just did.
Reverse psychology.
You let me think I was a loser to show me I'm really not a loser.
No, I just think she and Ronnie make a really cute couple.
- Shawn!
- But not as cute as you and Topanga.
Look, all I know is it's a new day and when I sweep Topi off her feet I want to be clean and fresh.
Cory, where are we gonna find a shower?
Now, where do we find a towel?
Topanga.
You haven't touched your food.
Guess I've just been thinking about someone.
- About me, huh?
- No.
Now, what is it with you?
I mean, ever since we got here you've been trying to kiss me.
And if I let you, then what?
Then you leave because you got your prize.
Well, I'm not a prize and I hate it when guys chase me - and the more they chase me - Topanga!
- the more I get turned off.
- Topanga!
- Topanga.
- You know, what is it with your friend?
He's just showing how much he loves you.
This one was my idea.
Topanga!
Topanga!
Uh, maybe you didn't know, but that was me in that tank.
I did know and I'd like you to stop chasing me, all right?
Please.
What are you talking about?
Look at everything I've done for you.
I mean, I flew here, I dressed in harem pants and a fez, which you know I don't pull off.
- I swam with the fishes, I - Cory.
You could hire the blimp, fly over Florida flashing my name in neon and it wouldn't mean a thing to me.
Oh, God, please don't look up.
I mean, they're all just meaningless gestures.
Mean How can they be meaningless?
They come from my heart.
I really wish I could believe you.
I really do.
But how can I when every time I turn around, there you are with another girl?
Oh, Topanga, come on, every time?
Kristen, right?
Cory, I was in the tank behind you.
You're a fast swimmer.
Look, Topanga, you can't keep running a Oh.
You're not Topanga.
What's a Topanga?
Sorry, it was just someone I was looking for.
I thought she'd be here, but I-I guess not.
I'll-I'll just get out of your way and let you do your fish work.
I don't work here.
I was just on a tour and I decided to hang back on my own.
Just me and a few dolphins and a big old bucket of smelts.
- Wanna help me feed 'em?
- Yeah, sure.
This one doesn't seem hungry.
Yeah, the trainer was telling me all about her.
Her name's Amber.
She's separated from her mate and she's having a really rough time.
She's just an animal.
Just an animal?
How do you get off saying something like that?
- Oh, I'm sorry, I just - Apologize to her.
I'm serious.
- I'm sorry.
- Personalize it.
I'm sorry, Amber.
If there's one thing I've learned hanging around here, it's that animals are like people.
They have real emotions.
I just wish I could get her to eat.
Maybe you'll have better luck.
What is your name?
Cory.
Cory, well, I hope you find who you're looking for.
So, Amber, you're separated from your mate, huh?
I know how you feel.
Not that Topanga's my mate or anything.
I just believe she is.
It's funny though.
You know, people tell you to get on with your life, go date, there's plenty of other fish in the sea.
Like I need to tell you.
But, see, we know that once you've met that special person it's hard to live knowing they're out there and they're the only one you care about.
All those things I did, I wasn't just trying to impress her, I just didn't know how to express my feelings.
Well, at least I tried, you know?
And now I'm talking to a fish.
See you, Amber.
Cory.
I heard what you said.
Wait.
No.
Look, Topanga, I read you loud and clear.
- But, Cory - I understand you, all right?
I'm not gonna chase you anymore.
We'll just go back to being friends or whatever it is you want to be.
Cory, you got on a plane and flew across the country to see me.
I know, OK?
I'm embarrassed.
I didn't even get the free miles.
I mean, you dressed in silly outfits, you swam with sharks.
I kn There were sharks in there?
I mean, it was like you were not gonna give up no matter what.
Look, how many times do I have to tell you I'm sorry?
No.
No.
Now it's my turn to tell you I'm sorry.
I mean, I never realized these things came from your heart.
Until now.
Wait, wait.
I'm really confused.
So am I. So what's going on?
I mean, are we friends or what?
Or what.
What are we doing?
I don't know.
I mean, we did break up for a reason, right?
Yeah, we did.
And that reason was So we could get back together.
Cory, gone for two days, what did you think you were gonna tell us?
I was out front chipping golf balls?
For starters, this house and school are the only two places you're gonna see for the next month.
A month?
I got more the time I said.
- Morgan!
- Morgan!
You get up to your room there.
You're grounded for two months.
I gotta learn self-control.
And, Cory Go ahead, Morgan.
Kick me when I'm down.
I thought what you did for Topanga was really sweet.
I hope some day a boy does that for me.
Look.
What I did was wrong, OK?
But just in case there's any chance of leniency Here.
Snow domes from Disney World.
Upstairs.
Then I'll be taking these back.
Cory?
I'm glad everything worked out with you and Topanga.
Me too, Mom.
You may keep yours.
Hey, Mom, Dad.
You, sit down.
We know it was you who covered for Cory while he was in Orlando.
Now, without evidence, there's no way for you to tie me to this messy affair so I bid you farewell.
Ah, Mr. Matthews.
I was planting in the garden and I dug this up.
I believe it's yours.
Oh, come on.
Is this the best you can do?
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Matthews.
The teachers got together and, well, we have a few things for you.
Oh, thanks, guys.
Graduation gift?
Confiscation gift.
You get your stuff back like we promised.
Hey!
My giant underpants.
These always got a laugh.
And my personal favorite, the Feeny puppet.
Oh, little George.
We'll leave you two alone.
Detention, Mr. Matthews.
Detention, Mr. Matthews.
What are you doing with this ridiculous thing?
It's just a dummy.
I'm not talking to you.
You're gonna miss me, aren't you, Mr. Feeny?
Am I?
Have you heard from any more colleges?
Oh, yeah.
Actually, today I got turned down from Penn State and BU.
Looks like I'm gonna end up with my first choice.
That's North Southwestern San Diego State.
Ah, yes.
Old NSWSDS.
U. Yeah, you know, I'm on the waiting list so I should get my official acceptance any day.
Then it's goodbye Philamadelphia.
- Any summer plans?
- Yeah.
I'm gonna travel.
I'm gonna spend two months in my car and see all 50 states.
How do you intend to drive to Hawaii?
I'm gonna drive till they start speaking Chinese, then hang a U-ie.
Topanga.
So.
Here we are.
Me and you.
Last day of school, back together.
Back together.
- Did I mention we're back together?
- Refresh my memory.
Listen, I want you to know that I'm completely secure with our relationship, and that if you want to spend your summer away at camp, I am totally OK with it.
- That is so mature.
- 'Cause I'm going with you.
- Cory, it's an all-girls camp.
- What time's swimming?
Cory, it's only one summer.
We will have plenty more together.
I know, but look, this is the most important summer of our lives.
I mean, it's the summer of our 15th year, and if we don't spend it together we'll never get it back.
That's really sweet, but it'll only make our 16th summer all the more special.
Look, I'll pay you a thousand dollars to hang out with me.
Cory!
It's only two months.
The time is gonna fly and before you know it we will be back together.
Back together.
Which in Spanish is "back together, muchacha.
" Well, that was a brave front.
What's the matter, Mr. Matthews?
You seem a little down.
Perhaps some more history homework would cheer you up?
Hm?
Knock it off, Eric.
You know I'm not a big fan of your Feeny puppet.
Come on, Cor.
I mean, I thought everything was great now that you and Topanga are back together.
Big kiss.
Back together.
Big kiss.
Hey, hey, hey.
Stay out of my personal life.
Hey, come on, Cory.
I mean, Topanga's leaving for the summer and I'm sorry, but that's got nothing to do with me.
I got one week left here.
Let's make it great.
Just like old times.
What old times?
OK, fine.
Topanga's going to camp.
And it's an all-girl camp.
But, I mean, there's no threat there.
There's more time for us, right?
The boys of summer.
Cory, I'm gonna spend the next two months traveling with my dad.
The boy of summer.
All right.
Just me.
Fine.
You know, I thought you said you were staying home this summer?
Well, I am.
I mean, that's the beauty of a mobile home - wherever you go, you're home.
So you're leaving too.
Well, not for a couple of days.
- Are you OK, Cor?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Fine.
I mean, I can do without my best friend and my girlfriend for a couple of months, right?
I mean, it's not like I can't make new friends.
See?
Mom, Dad, I've decided I'm spending my summer in Atlanta selling international flags at the Olympic village.
- No, you're not.
- Well, then, this summer blows.
- Cory, the summer's barely started.
- I know, Mom, and already I got no Topanga, I got no Shawn, I got nothing.
Hey, your brother's here for another week.
Yeah, Cor.
Why don't you come sit with us?
Eric's telling us about his trip.
I'm not really interested in Eric's trip.
Oh, you're right, Cor.
Why don't we put my entire cross-country trip on hold so you can tell us how great the park is?
How is that monkey-bar restoration coming?
It's a junglegym, Eric.
All right, you know what?
Why don't you tell us how you're gonna see the Grand Canyon in four-and-a-half minutes?
By donkey.
Guys, stop the sniping.
Yeah, it'll stop for good when I leave next week.
There's Eric, always leaving.
Why should I be surprised, right?
"Hey, Cor, wanna shoot some hoops?
Oh, wait.
Here comes Janice.
" Or "Hey, Cor, want a ride to school?
Wait, my friends want rides.
Sorry.
" Oh, gee, Cor, I'd love to stay and take some more abuse but - oops - I got more packing to do.
Cory, I'll be your friend this summer.
Thanks, Morgan.
Oops, I forgot.
I have day camp.
- You see?
- Cor, what are you really upset about?
What do you mean?
I'm upset that Topanga's going to camp.
- You think that's it, huh?
- Yeah.
I mean, how could she do that?
Cor, she's 15 years old.
She has a right to go to camp.
You know, you guys never sent me to camp.
- Are you insane?
- We tried to send you to camp when you were eight, but we had to come and take you home.
Every day you sent us letters telling us they were conducting medical experiments on you.
And they were.
Cor, this is gonna be a great summer.
Things are gonna work out for the best.
They always do.
- You really believe that?
- Yeah.
I do.
Eric, Uh, I just wanna tell you that, um I- I know this week hasn't been the easiest for any of us, but Oh, man.
Look at this mess.
- Yep.
A lot of years to pack away.
- Yeah.
But look at my bed.
That's actually how you left it this morning.
Uh, I certainly don't think it was anywhere near as bad till you left your mess on it.
Fine.
I will move my sock.
Thank you.
Look Cor, I know your summer's off to a rough start and everything, but, uh look at the good.
I'm gonna be outta here in a week and you're gonna have the entire room to yourself.
I've always had this room to myself.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Oh, come on, Eric.
The way you treat me and you gotta ask?
You ignore me.
- We do stuff together.
- Yeah, only when you're stuck.
I mean, you never actually did anything with me 'cause you wanted to.
What am I supposed to say to that, Cory?
I mean, you're three years younger than me.
I have my own friends.
Yeah?
And where are your friends gonna be next year?
I mean, you guys will all be off at different colleges, but I'll still be your brother, Eric.
You're right, Cory.
I am a terrible brother.
You know, buddy, in a week I'm gonna be gone and I'm gonna be the best brother you've ever had.
- Whoa.
What are you doing with this?
- I'm taking it to college.
Eric, this is my Mike Schmidt autographed baseball.
- Cor, he signed it to both of us.
- Oh, Eric, you know Just give it to me.
- Cor, cut it out, seriously.
All right.
Hey!
- Eric, stop being such a jerk.
Give it to me.
Cor, you know something?
You're absolutely right.
- This is your ball.
- Yes!
- You want it?
- Yes!
Yeah, here.
Catch!
I can't believe you just did that, Eric.
Oh, Cor, really, please.
Don't do that 'cause you're gonna get hurt.
No, I don't think so, OK?
Hey!
Hey!
Eric.
- Cut it out.
Get off of him.
Cory.
- Boys, stop it.
- Stop it.
- What is the matter with you two?
- Hey, I tried to be the nice guy.
- Oh, come on, guys.
This is our last week all together and it's your last week sharing this room.
Yeah, why do I have to share it for another week?
You know, I don't really need this anymore.
I'm outta here tomorrow.
- Eric, you are not leaving tomorrow.
- Yeah, I am.
No, maybe you didn't hear me.
You're not leaving tomorrow.
You haven't got your letter of acceptance to college yet.
I'm on the waiting list.
The official acceptance comes, like, a day before classes and I'm not giving this trip up.
Look.
You are upset about your brother, and, Eric, you are not thinking this through.
What is the difference?
A week here, a week there.
Eric, maybe when you're a parent, and your first child is about ready to leave home, you will understand that every day, every minute makes a difference.
Guys, you don't think I'm not freaked out about leaving?
Like going to college, being on my own, doing my own laundry?
I'm having nightmares.
Whites, easy.
Darks, easy.
What about my white shirt with black stripes?
What then?
Well, so?
This is tough on all of us.
Look, that's why I think it's just gonna be easier if I take off now.
You know, we have this goodbye dinner planned for you.
If you can move the dinner to tomorrow night, I'll stay an extra day.
Please.
- We'll think about it.
- Thank you.
And another little bit of advice.
You take that extra day, and you try and figure out what is bothering your brother.
I've shared that room with him for 15 years.
I have no idea what's bothering him.
Ah, well, maybe that's your answer.
- We're so glad you stayed, Eric.
- Yeah, so am I. This dinner party's really cool.
It was a good idea having Cory's friends here too.
Well, considering how he feels about Shawn and Topanga leaving for the summer we thought it'd be a good idea for him.
Take your arm off me, man.
You're making me nervous.
Topanga, am I making you nervous?
Uh-huh.
If I may, I have something more to say.
- Oh, no.
- Shh!
He's gonna be your principal one day.
Oh, no.
Eric, earlier this year, it was doubtful that you would graduate.
But you responded to the pressure, applied yourself, and not only grew as a student, but as a person.
- And I, for one, couldn't be happier.
- Thank you, Mr. Feeny.
Oh, also, I brought a little gift.
I took the liberty to pull this and have it framed.
Your high-school diploma.
Oh, oh, Mr. Feeny.
Oh, thank you.
And I know how much you hate to be touched, but give me this one, hm?
All right.
All right, Eric.
Hey.
Hey, buddy, don't you want to say something?
No, that's OK.
Come on, Cory.
He's your brother.
You should say something.
No, I don't have anything planned.
You know, I really don't think I could've done this without everyone in this room believing in me.
That's why this diploma, which signifies my intelligence, belongs as much to you as it does to I. - Me.
- I included you.
Oh, dear.
Hang on.
I do have a toast to make.
Attention, everybody.
To my brother, Eric, who's moving out.
And not just for four years, probably forever.
And I don't even know him.
And now I probably never will.
Goodbye.
I- I hope you have a nice life.
I really do.
I'm sorry, everyone.
- That's the last bag.
Car's all loaded.
- Yeah, I guess this is it.
Oh, Eric.
Are you sure you can't stay for breakfast?
I could fix you an omelet.
Toast, pancakes, muffins.
Pizza.
Ma, you just want me to stay till the freezer's empty, don't you?
- Does it show?
- Just 'cause I know you.
Well, don't forget to say goodbye to your brother.
- I didn't see him this morning.
- He slept on the coach.
He's pretty embarrassed about last night.
I gotta tell him there's nothing to be embarrassed about.
Hey, Cory.
Come on, get up.
Your brother's leaving.
Well, he said he was gonna go to the park to say goodbye to Topanga.
Maybe he already left.
Uh, yeah.
You know, um Just, uh, tell him goodbye and, you know, give him a hug for me.
Eric, I mean, we'll hug him, but I don't think that's gonna make Cory feel any better.
I'm just going off to college.
I mean, I'm still his brother.
Eric, now it's, you know, "just going off to college.
" Then it's gonna be, "Oh, I'm just getting married.
" "Just having kids.
" But you know that you'll never be the same brother as you were upstairs, sharing that room.
I'm the older brother.
I mean, it's not my fault I'm the older brother.
Yes, but it's not Cory's fault that he's the younger brother, who never understood why your buddies and your girlfriends always seemed to be more important to you than him.
He's three years younger than me.
He's got his own girlfriend.
He's got his own buddies.
I bet he'd understand me better now.
Well, it sounds like you have a lot more in common now.
Yeah, I guess we do.
And three years isn't that big a difference anymore.
No, I mean, I You know, I never really looked at it like that.
I guess Cory and I could be friends now.
His girlfriend's leaving him for the summer and his best friend's leaving him for the summer, and now his brother, who he's never really had a chance to get to know as a friend, is leaving.
Forever.
But why aren't you guys upset?
Uh, well, we got to know you.
It's OK.
You can leave.
Your father and I know you're a good guy.
And you have a good heart.
And you've always made us proud.
So I guess this is goodbye.
Uh, uh Yeah, uh You know, I'm We're not very good at this.
A few bucks, uh, you know - Emergencies, whatever.
- What about the gold card?
No.
Oh, good.
You didn't leave yet.
I wanted to give you something.
Oh, Fluffers.
Your favorite bear.
Are you giving him to me for luck, Morgan?
No.
I'm eight years old.
What do I need a stinking bear for?
- Are you gonna miss me, Morgan?
- I already do.
So, I guess there's nothing left to say, but goodbye.
I, um I love you all very much.
- We love you too.
- We love you too.
All right?
Go on, get outta here.
You wanna beat the rush hour.
- Yeah.
- Go on.
I don't know if I wanna go.
Yeah, but yesterday you could hardly wait to go.
I know.
I mean, usually I'm really looking forward to camp.
I mean, this time I feel like I'm too old for that.
I'd rather spend the summer with you.
- And that scares me.
- Look, if that's the way you feel, I want you to have a good time at camp, OK?
I mean, I'm completely secure.
You swear on your life it's an all-girls camp?
Cory, I want you to have a great time this summer.
Oh, don't you worry about me.
I mean, I'll be plenty busy doing the things I truly love to do.
Oh, Cory.
I can't leave you like this, man.
Shawn.
What are you doing here?
Me and my dad are hitting the road, so I figured I'd say goodbye.
That's my bus.
And that's my house.
I should get going.
- I'll miss you.
- Me too.
So, buddy, I'll, uh I'll see you in a couple of months, OK?
Yeah.
- Take care of yourself, Shawn.
- Yeah, you too.
It's just a summer, right?
You know, it'll go by quick.
Bye.
Cory Matthews dribbles at the top of the key.
He looks for the open man.
It's Cory Matthews.
He passes to Matthews.
Matthews sees Matthews set up for the three.
He feeds Matthews.
Matthews shoots.
Looks like your team could use some help.
- Eric.
- Hey, Cor.
I thought you'd be halfway to Jersey by now.
Yeah, I was.
Then I realized, here I am going off to college and I didn't even get a proper goodbye from my brother.
So that's why you came back?
To say goodbye?
Yeah.
Listen, Eric, I'm glad you're here, too, because, uh you know, I I never got to tell you I'm sorry for the way I've been acting.
Come on, I mean, it's no biggie.
We're brothers.
Brothers fight.
Yeah, but, see, I don't like it when we fight, you know?
And I also don't like it when I do things like this.
- It's my letter from North Southwestern.
- I know.
I took it from the mailbox yesterday.
I guess I just wasn't ready to let you go.
Eric, I-I feel like I'm just getting to know you, you know?
I mean, I've always liked you as a brother, you know, but I'm just starting to like you as a friend.
I didn't get in.
What?
They rejected me.
- Uh, maybe it was a mistake.
- It was my mistake.
It was my mistake thinking I could slack off for three and a half years, work hard for two months, and get in.
- Man, I really wanted to go to college.
- Hey, Eric.
You will, you know.
You take a couple of courses over the summer, reapply, and you know what?
I bet you get into an even better school.
- You think so?
- Hey.
You're my brother.
You know something, Cor?
Maybe you're right.
I mean, maybe I'll even find a school a little closer to home.
Well, I know where there's an open bed.
- Thanks, Cor.
- Yeah.
Think about it while you're gone.
- Where am I going?
- Across the country.
Oh, nah.
That trip was to celebrate.
There's nothing to celebrate now.
Oh, Eric.
Are you kidding me?
Come on, a trip like that?
That's something you never forget.
You know something, Cor?
You're right.
Maybe there is something to celebrate.
I'm gonna take that trip.
- First thing in the morning.
- Why wait?
I gotta wait for you to go home and pack.
- Me?
- Yeah.
Two months on the road.
I can't think of anybody else who I'd rather share the car with.
It's gonna be a summer we'll never forget.
Things always seem to work out for the best.
I've always believed that.
And on day two we see Virginia and Washington, DC.
Now, don't forget to give yourselves at least a day in Boston.
Oh.
The Cheers bar.
Maybe they'll know my name.
I was thinking more along the lines of Bunker Hill, Old North Church We have to remember, we're on a strict budget.
That's true.
But we could always sleep in President Lincoln's lap.
Yeah, yeah.
- Alan.
- Uh Oh, well see Washington.
You guys are good together.
OK, that's all we need.
The road's a-calling.
- Bye.
- Great, see you.
- Have a good trip.
- See you.
Thanks, Daddy-o.
Bye, Mommy.
Hey, now.
Remember, part of the deal of this trip is that you check out some colleges along the way.
It's the whole reason we're going.
Tulane, Ball State, uh Memphis State, uh, State Eric.
What makes you think I would want to spend my summer - the summer of my 15th year - seeing a bunch of colleges?
Because we're seeing them on our way to here.
"Myrtle Beach, South Beach, Fort Lauderdale, South Padre Island, Malibu"?
Smithsonian.
- Yeah, right!
- Yeah, right!
