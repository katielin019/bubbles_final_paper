{START OF EPISODE 1}
Happy birthday.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I'll never get this confetti out of my hair, but thank you.
The hats were my idea.
Seventeen has gotta be better than 16.
I mean, I've got a great boyfriend, I'm not new at school, and I've finally gotten used to being a witch.
- I'll have the liver-and-brie omelette.
- Here's your present.
I love presents.
It's a handbook.
One of these days, we have to talk about cool presents.
This is a study guide.
You see, when a witch turns 17, she has to take a test to get her witch's licence.
Will I have to parallel park my vacuum cleaner?
It doesn't work like that.
But for some reason you do have to take an eye exam.
A quizmaster will come in the next few days and test you.
- You only have two chances-- - Don't worry.
I can handle it.
I've gotta run or I'm gonna miss my bus.
Unless my other present is a car.
- Don't forget this.
- Next year, clothes, right?
She's never gonna study.
We have got to tell her about the consequences.
You know the rules.
We've given her the book.
Now it's up to Sabrina.
I'm sorry.
I thought I asked for an omelette.
Hello.
Don't be shellfish.
- Can I help you?
- I can't find my locker.
I'm Valerie.
This is my first day.
I'm Sabrina.
I was new last year.
Don't worry.
It's a pretty friendly school.
Freak.
- So, what's your locker number?
- Um - Twenty-seven.
- That's right near mine.
Come on.
- So where did you move from?
- Minnesota.
We move a lot.
- Why'd that girl call you a freak?
- Libby?
Because she's a cheerleader, and she has a limited vocabulary.
Oh, so you're not really odd?
No.
Well, not in a way that anyone knows about.
Good, because just once I'd like to be in a cool crowd.
Oh, I know that makes me sound really shallow.
I hate that about myself.
Look, just go on without me.
- I'm dragging you down.
- Here's your locker.
You're still talking to me.
Oh, Sabrina.
Just who I'm looking for.
I think you should take AP Algebra after school.
It's a lot of work, but you can get college credit for it.
- I think I can handle that.
- Great.
That's an interesting book.
May I see that?
Oh, it's kind of a family heirloom.
And that's why I keep it in my locker.
Oh.
- Hey, birthday girl.
- It's your birthday?
Or is that a nickname?
Harvey, this is Valerie.
Valerie, Harvey.
I love my earrings.
Thanks.
My mom said you'd like them more than a knife.
Oh, here, taste these.
I baked them for the football bake sale tomorrow.
Tastes like Tell you what.
I'll bake you cookies for the sale.
Thanks.
I was hoping you'd say that.
Better get to chemistry.
See you later.
Wow, teachers like you, you've got a cute boyfriend - Can I be your friend?
- We'll see.
I'm having interviews all week.
You're kidding, right?
Because that's happened to me before.
You'll be the editor this year?
Well, not in so many words.
Well, actually, it was just that many words.
He said, "You'll be the editor this year".
- Cool.
- And when I am the editor the school paper is going to be different.
No freakazoid news.
I can't believe Libby's taking over the paper too.
- You should take over the paper.
- Me?
Yeah.
You'd be great and fair.
And I'm not saying that because I want you to like me.
- Thanks.
- Do you like me?
Hello.
Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.
Prayers are answered.
Yeah.
Fifties, 20s.
- Oh, my.
- Oh, good.
Looks like our bond matured.
The one we got in 1660?
I knew people would say "yes" to sanitation.
You wanna go to the Slicery?
I can't.
I'm going to join the newspaper staff.
I thought you were swamped with work.
I am, but I can handle it.
And this has the added bonus of driving Libby insane.
I'll call you later.
Okay, but you haven't forgotten the dance on Friday, have you?
The big event honouring all the football players that everyone's been talking about for weeks?
I remember it.
But I forgot your name.
Looking for the loser convention?
I am.
And look: I found it.
Hi.
Hi, I'm Valerie.
Ew, they're multiplying.
I feel good about myself.
I feel good about myself.
- I feel good about myself.
- Don't panic.
When Mr. Kraft gets here we'll clean house.
Greetings, newshounds.
Welcome to the Westbridge Lantern.
I think there's been a mistake.
Mr. Kraft is the faculty advisor of this club.
Not anymore.
After 17 years, he's grown to loathe and detest the paper.
Hi, Sabrina.
Now, this year, the editorial position is not going to be a popularity contest.
- What?
- Everyone who is interested can submit an editorial by tomorrow.
This is amazing.
And I didn't even use magic.
Magic?
Yeah.
That's Westbridge slang for curse words.
I hate being new.
Great cake.
Piece number five might've been a mistake.
Do I have any frosting on my face?
Well, a birthday should be a time for fun.
Did you get a chance to study the handbook?
Not really.
Oh, man.
Study.
I've got a history test tomorrow.
Sabrina, remember: The handbook is also important.
Did our parents go through this torture?
Not with me.
I memorized the whole book.
I memorized the whole book.
- Get rid of them.
- What?
The goody two-shoes.
Oops.
Sabrina, yo!
I was just resting my eyes.
Don't you think you're overextending yourself?
No.
Okay.
My editorial's done.
Time for history.
I'm so handling things.
"Patrick Henry gave an impassioned speech in Williamsburg, where he proclaimed, 'Give me liberty or give me death".
" Actually, he was gonna say, "Give me liberty or give me some other option".
I told him I thought it needed more punch.
Hello?
Hi, Harvey.
Oh, hi, Harvey.
I'm sorry.
I know I was supposed to call you.
Now, tell me if you don't think this is deep: When you assume something, you make a Shoot.
I knew I should have written it down.
If you Shoot.
Maybe it wasn't "assume".
Sabrina?
Sabrina?
Sabrina?
--degrees here at downtown Westbridge.
Let us greet the day with The Brothers Chunk.
Ow!
- Who are you?
- I'm your quizmaster.
Please, don't hit.
- Is it time for the test?
- Are you kidding?
You are not ready.
This is a warning.
You haven't cracked this hand.
I mean, not even the knuckles.
Hey.
I like that one.
Okay, you've made your point.
I'll study.
- And stop hitting.
- When will I have the actual test?
When you least expect it.
Ohh, I hope I can handle this.
Man, I did lousy on that history test.
I know.
I got so frustrated in there, I almost used magic.
What?
- Curse words, right?
- Oh, right.
Look, Val, I gotta run.
I gotta meet Harvey for lunch.
- Okay.
Bye.
- See you.
Oh, no.
What are you doing here, quizmaster?
Well, have you been studying, Sabrina?
- The test is coming, you know.
- I know.
Look, I'm kind of in a hurry.
Oh, I can fix that.
Can you stop time, Sabrina?
Page 201.
Okay, I'll look it up.
Well, how about speeding time up?
Page 949.
Okay.
I've been warned.
Oh, great.
Now you sped up time, and now I'm late.
- Hi, Harvey.
Eating alone?
- No, he's not.
Sorry.
Time kind of got away from me.
I wanted to talk to you about tux colours.
Can I finish your sandwich?
I can't decide between powder blue and maroon.
Let me have everyone's attention, please.
Great.
Mr. School-Spirit.
Some of you freshmen have not met me yet.
I am Vice Principal Kraft.
Just like the cheese.
BOY : Loser.
And I heard that.
Now, I am happy to announce that the pep club has decided to decorate the dance this Friday with posters honouring each football player.
- Wow, Harvey, your own poster.
- And that's not all.
These posters will be made by each player's girlfriend.
So, gals, get busy.
That's ridiculous.
Ooh, let's just hope you have Tourette's, little missy.
Just because a girl's dating a football player doesn't mean she has time to do artwork for him on demand.
Yeah, well, you see, we're just talking about sprucing up the dance, not taking back the vote.
I think posters are a brilliant idea.
Well, thank you, Libby.
And thank your father for that box of steaks.
You understand what I mean, don't you?
I'd feel like your slave.
No, I understand.
It's a stupid idea.
- Who needs a poster?
- Right.
So now, what were you saying about tuxedos?
Oh, I need help deciding--  Sorry.
We'll talk later.
Oh, well.
Maybe one day you'll have a girlfriend who cares about you.
Oh, no.
Sabrina forgot this again.
I know we're not allowed to tell her what will happen if she fails, but how about I just zap it to her?
- Hey.
- It's Sabrina's responsibility.
We're not allowed to meddle.
All right.
You know, it's weird.
I keep counting this, and I keep coming up short.
Really?
Oh, please, please.
Oh, please.
- Hey.
- Hi.
I don't have time to talk.
I've gotta get to my AP Algebra after-school-lecture, credit, college-prep thing.
Well, okay, but can I have the cookies?
What cookies?
The cookies you said you'd bake for the sale.
- It's starting in five minutes.
- Right.
Wait here.
Whoa.
If you wish to run, Miss Spellman, the girl's track-and-field team meets after school.
In the hallway, we walk.
Yes, sir.
And, Miss Spellman, I would-- Well, where did those come from?
Bakery?
No, I just bumped into you five seconds ago.
You did not have any cookies.
Yes, I did.
If I weren't on antihistamines, I'd look into this.
- Oh, no.
Now?
- Are you ready?
Put those back.
I conjured those.
Oh, just reverse my spell.
- I don't know how.
- It's on page 77.
You know, you really should try studying.
Toodles.
I have to go.
Where are the cookies?
Robbery?
I'm sorry, I forgot.
I was really busy.
You know, Sabrina, you're always busy these days.
It's like you don't have time to be my girlfriend.
That's not true.
I've just had other really important stuff to do.
- So I'm not important.
- I didn't say that.
Let's just forget about the dance.
I'm sure you're too busy anyway.
Hilda, I've been thinking about what we should do with the bond money.
I think we should invest it.
Oh, no.
You promised this would be fun money.
Really?
Doesn't sound like me.
I don't wanna be practical.
Come on, Zeldy.
Imagine your wildest dream.
Okay.
Another T-bill, please.
No, no, no.
Here, I'll show you how to daydream.
- Is that Erik Estrada?
- Yeah.
I loved him in CHiPs.
Oh, but you have to see him in Dos Mujeres, Un Camino.
But you can't buy Erik Estrada.
No.
But maybe you can lure him with this '62 Thunderbird convertible.
- Now try again.
- All right.
Much better.
Ugh.
Sorry.
I really like investing.
We are not blowing centuries of interest on more interest.
At least let me lick your hands.
Sabrina?
You were a little unfocused today.
- Was I?
- Yeah.
You see, six times seven is 42, not 12.
Sorry.
Man, do I need a cupcake.
Maybe it's because I went generic, I don't know.
Darn HMO.
Who's supposed to read this?
Hi.
Got a minute?
Actually, I'm in the middle of something important.
Here's your yummy doodles.
Well, whenever you wanna talk, I'm ready.
Trouble with the little lady?
How about we buy stocks?
That's exciting.
It's just like gambling.
No one talk to me.
I have to call Harvey.
We're obviously never going to agree, so how about we flip for it?
Winner takes all.
Deal.
My head, I win.
Your head, you lose.
Yeah, like I'm gonna fall for that old trick.
Again.
What's going on?
His father said Harvey's still not home.
Why won't he talk to me?
Maybe because he's still not home.
Besides, don't you have other more important things to worry about?
- You rang?
- Great.
The stressmaster.
You know, the other kids I quiz give me stuff.
How about molecular transference, Sabrina?
Can you do that?
I'd bone up if I were you.
Oh, and remember.
Fudge is a nice way to say, "I care".
You got a cute one.
He's right.
I'm not ready.
I don't know molecular transference.
Sure, you do.
You know how to zap yourself from one place to another.
Yeah.
Go ahead.
Put yourself behind the counter.
You're thinking about too much.
Clear your mind.
Try again.
Oh, dear.
You've shorted your finger.
- Too much stress.
- Rats.
- Ha!
Well, look at that.
I won.
- Rats.
Okay.
A panel of teachers read everyone's editorials, and-- We all like Libby's.
Well, all the teachers thought Libby's was really good.
- All right.
- But not quite as interesting as Sabrina's.
Sabrina, you are the new editor of the Westbridge Lantern.
Thanks.
I can handle this.
I think.
That's just wrong.
You're the editor.
I'm the editor's friend.
There is no way this can't be cool.
Talk to you later.
What's all that?
Newspaper stuff.
- I'm editor.
I know it's more work, but-- - No.
It's great.
Lots of famous people were editors of their school newspaper.
Really?
Like who?
Charlemagne?
- Sabrina-- - I know.
- Let's never fight again.
- Okay.
And I've been thinking I'd like to make you a poster for the dance.
Doesn't that sort of go against everything you believe in?
Yeah, but big deal.
- Do you have the time?
- Sure.
- Thanks.
- And I bet if the girls in science club got their boyfriends to make them posters, you'd make one for me, right?
You bet.
They're not, are they?
I didn't mean that about the dance.
I really want you to come.
- I'd love to.
- Great.
You haven't ordered that powder-blue tux yet, have you?
There.
Poster's done.
- What do you think?
- It's gorgeous.
If you're into gushy.
Okay.
Now time to study the handbook.
I think I'll start with molecular transference.
Howdy.
- Look, I'm studying.
- Oh, great.
- It's time.
- But I'm not ready.
Hmm.
Nope.
I don't care.
Okay.
Ahem.
Sabrina Spellman, are you ready to be tested?
I told you, no.
Too bad.
Sabrina Spellman, here is your quiz: Train A left Sturbridge at 8:00.
Train B left Boston at 6:30.
What time will they meet in Westbridge?
I can do this.
Okay, what speed are they going?
I believe this is your test.
I know how to find the speed.
Molecular transference.
Come through, and there's a new ring in your future.
Yes.
Excuse me.
Seventy-five miles per hour.
Thank you.
Who are you?
I'm a dream.
You're dreaming that someone came for the speed-- Sixty-two miles per hour.
--got the speed, and left.
I hate these night runs.
Got it.
The trains should meet in Westbridge at 1:03 a.m. Right.
Unfortunately, there's only one track in Westbridge.
And it's already 1:02.
Uh-oh.
I know.
I'll just divert them.
Um Trains are big And they are leaded Move them away From where they're headed  - I did it.
- Excellent.
Except - Except what?
- Except when things are diverted they have to go somewhere.
Oops.
You have to remember that all magic has consequences.
And you have to think about the consequences before you act.
So I got it wrong?
Ooh, people are gonna write country music about how wrong you got it.
Let me guess.
You failed your first try?
- I'll get it next time.
- I'm sure you will.
But, unfortunately, there's a penalty.
No dessert?
Witch camp?
What's witch camp?
It's like military school.
If military school were run by really strict, sadistic witches.
It'll be okay.
We'll pick you up in two days.
Two days?
But I'll miss Harvey's dance.
But you'll learn to kill and cook your own food.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
This is so not me.
WITCHES : We are witches with positive powers We'll be marching For hours and hours - I don't wanna go to witch camp.
- Come on.
- It won't be that bad.
- Are you kidding?
I've been there.
- What?
- I didn't study either.
And don't bother fleeing to Canada.
It doesn't work.
Time to go.
Need a hand?
That was so not nice.
Lots of swimming pools in the Other Realm.
Ow.
Name?
Sabrina Spellman.
Regulation uniform, SP pack, dog tags, boots.
- I'm just a number to you, aren't I?
- S-dash-2103411819-dash-577-K.
Okay, so I'm a lot of numbers to you.
- I wish we could help Sabrina.
- You know we can't.
But I have something that's going to cheer you up.
I'm going to take a walk on the wild side - and spend the money.
- No.
- Yes.
I'm going to buy a lab.
- A puppy?
- A dog?
- No, a laboratory.
I'm not relieved.
It's time I branched out from physics into chemistry.
I really think I can help mankind.
Maybe end hunger, cure diseases, develop a nail-polish remover that doesn't stink.
Where are we gonna put a laboratory?
The dungeon's full.
It'll fit right on top of the dining-room table.
I'm gonna buy one of those new quantum labtops.
Oh, let's just invest it.
- Hey, look, we wore the same outfit.
- No talking during cleanup.
Ten-hut!
Well, looks like we got another crop of pathetic witches.
You couldn't zap your way out of a paper bag.
Prepare for inspection.
Get that dirt out of those fingernails, witch girl.
Those cuticles are a disgrace.
- Well done, Fink.
- Sir, I just had a manicure, sir.
Spellman.
Spellman.
Why is that name so familiar?
Hilda Spellman.
Hilda "Thorn in My Side" Spellman.
- Don't tell me you're related to Hilda.
- Okay.
All right, we all know why you're here.
You're failures.
Washouts.
Losers.
And it's my unfortunate duty to take your sorry fingers and make men out of them.
Now, get out there and make some magic.
Out!
Hut!
Hut!
Hut!
Hut!
Hut!
Hut!
Hut  Excuse me, Sergeant Slater.
I appreciate all you're trying to do, but I have a bit of a situation.
- A situation?
- Yeah, see, it's really just bad timing.
Tonight's the football formal kickoff at my high school.
- Ah, big doings in the Other Realm.
- Right, and I promised Harvey-- Your special guy.
Exactly.
I promised him that I'd be there, and I've been kind of letting him down a lot lately.
Well, precious, I know how important these high school things are.
Really?
So do you think it'll be okay if I go?
What I think is you're in witch camp now!
My hair.
I can't believe we had to scale that wall till we hit clouds.
- Crybaby.
- If I had strength, I'd trip you.
Ten-hut!
If you thought today was fun, just wait till tomorrow.
- What are these?
- Deactivators.
While that's on your ankle, you can't use your magic.
Just in case anybody's thinking about popping in popcorn or popping out to Paris.
Nighty-nights, ladies.
Just doesn't sound as mean when they really are ladies.
I see you.
Regulations prohibit puttering after lights out.
Conserve your energy, Fink.
You have a lot of kissing up to do tomorrow.
Look, I know what you're doing, and I'm going to tell.
Regulations prohibit getting out of bed before sunup.
Drat.
First thing in the morning, I'm tattling my brains out.
I'm so glad we spent our small fortune on a briefcase.
So fire it up and whip me up some hospital-grade catnip.
Uh-uh.
This is highly technical equipment.
No one touches anything until I've read the manual.
- Push the button.
- You push it.
Push it.
Cool.
Ow!
Mine!
Ow!
Yeah, I'd like to place an order.
I'll be paying with cash.
First item: mouse on a string.
Now, that's a real mouse, right?
No?
Yeah, and don't ever call me here again.
Sabrina?
You busted out of the joint?
- I've gotta get this deactivator off.
- I'll pick it with my dewclaw.
It's essentially the same lock that's on your diary.
Huh.
I clean up pretty good.
- Hey, Harvey.
- Sabrina, you finally made it.
Wild dogs couldn't keep me away.
Hey, you shaved.
Second time this month.
It's getting to be a real pain.
- So did you bring my poster?
- Poster.
Right.
Bathroom.
Be right back.
They're big enough.
Just go.
Have fun.
Here you go, Harvey.
Okay.
No, no, not again.
No.
- Okay.
- Kink?
It could be your sports name.
You know, like Shaq.
Well, at least you tried.
Let's go to the dance.
Sounds great.
You know, I think they offer art classes in summer school.
All right, I'm ready to open her up.
Put that down!
We'll put a plant over that spot.
I specifically told you not to touch anything.
I think that's what made it so tempting.
You have no expertise at this level of chemicals.
That's what they said to the guy who invented Post-its.
Ha.
Whoo!
Cool.
You know, Zelda, I can admit when I'm wrong.
I love the labtop.
We are not keeping this car.
And we are not keeping Erik Estrada.
It's not so much a poster as a cry for help.
Deep down she can't be happy, right?
Sabrina, I know I'll probably step on your toes, and it'll be really awkward, but do you wanna dance?
How can I resist?
- You're not a bad dancer.
Ow!
- Sorry.
I'm glad we're finally spending some time together.
Me too.
Spellman!
- What'd I step on?
- No, no, I'm okay.
Looks like she dances as well as she draws.
Gotta go.
Sabrina!
You lost your boot?
Unauthorized leave, upsetting a fellow recruit, deactivating your deactivator, feeding a canine officer a non-food substance.
- Hey, he picked that fight, not me.
- Oh, yeah?
That's not what he said.
Oh, my poor finger.
So sorry.
- Your two days are up.
- Woo-hoo!
Spellman, that may be a premature "woo-hoo".
If you miss your second question, you'll be mine for an entire year.
And if you're anything like your aunt, you will miss it.
Don't worry.
I won't be back.
Sabrina, we're here to take you home.
Hilda Spellman.
Oh, no, the flashbacks.
Isn't that sweet?
He remembers me.
Thanks for the soak.
Well, better go study the magic handbook.
Just as soon as I catch up with Harvey and Valerie.
Sabrina.
- What?
You can't study all the things you need to study and keep doing all the extra things you've been doing.
- You think?
- Let's make a list of all your activities - and see where we can skim the fat.
- All right.
Well, study the magic handbook, school, hang with Valerie, edit the paper, AP Algebra, and Harvey stuff.
You know, like football games, Slicery, phone calls.
Now, what can you cut out?
School?
All right, I'll-- I'll stay on the paper, but I'll give up being editor.
- And?
- And what?
Algebra.
- The Harvey stuff.
- You have to cut back a little.
I can't cut back on Harvey.
There's more at stake than you realise.
I can't say more, or Zelda will hurt me.
How can I cut back on Harvey now?
I mean, I fell asleep on the phone, I forgot about his cookies, I-- I made him the worst poster, and I left him at the school dance.
I'm a lousy girlfriend.
He deserves better.
Can't believe I have to cut back on Harvey.
How am I gonna do it?
Ow.
Salem, is this new?
No way.
Carbon-date the teeth marks if you don't believe me.
I can't even go to the game with him.
Poor Harvey.
I can't imagine how he's gonna react.
Harvey, you deserve more than a part-time girlfriend, so we have to see less of each other.
No!
No!
I can't do that to Harvey.
I don't wanna hurt him.
- Well, whip up a "no-pain" spell.
- "No-pain" spell?
Never heard of that.
- You really do need to study more.
- Okay, okay.
I'm studying, I'm studying.
Let's see "No fat, no nonsense, No, no, Nanette"?
Oh, here it is.
"No pain".
Wow, looks hard.
It's got a lot of ingredients.
Follow me.
- Okay.
Push the button.
- No, you push it.
Push it.
Cool.
Now, should I make "no-pain" pudding or "no-pain" fruitcake?
Go with the pudding.
Fruitcake is better for breaking up with retirees.
Right.
Okay, we'll make butterscotch.
Let's see.
A few drops of hydrochloride.
Ammonia phosphate.
- Raisins?
- High in fibre.
- And glycerine.
Do you see glycerine?
- I think it's the blue goo.
That can't be right.
I don't have time for this.
So when you dipped me and I looked in the mirrored ball, I suddenly felt sick, I had to get out of there.
I bet it was those quesadillas the driver's ed teacher brought.
He hasn't been the same since that sophomore ran him over.
Well, we'll make up for lost time this Friday at the football game.
- I brought you butterscotch pudding.
- Sabrina, that's so sweet.
- I'm gonna save it.
- No.
Eat it.
Looks great, but I can't.
Coach says, "You eat a pudding at lunch, you're a pudding on the field," and I think that's bad.
Have you seen the gut on that guy?
What does he know?
I guess one little bite won't hurt.
Okay.
Should pudding fizz?
Harvey, you deserve more than a part-time girlfriend, so I think we should see less of each other.
Okay.
Okay.
And I guess that means I won't be able to watch you not play in the game on Friday.
Okay.
So I don't want to leave you hanging, so I guess you should invite someone else.
Hey, Jennifer.
Wanna go to the game on Friday?
- Sure.
- Good.
I meant someone in your family.
- So how'd it go with Harvey?
- He's fine.
But I could use a pudding.
When I feel bad, I have corn dogs.
Mrs. Quick, I think the paper would be better served by an editor who has more time.
I knew she'd crack.
Sorry to lose you, Sabrina, but there was another editorial that really gave us goose bumps and was spelled correctly.
You're in.
Our new editor will be Valerie.
Valerie?
Congratulations.
You'll be great.
Yeah, it's wonderful.
I'm gonna be sick.
Okay, here's the next question.
Gibbous moon.
Significance thereof.
Right now I'm missing the football game.
Oh, please.
The boy doesn't even play.
Come on.
Gibbous moon.
When flying during a gibbous moon, there can be reduced visibility due to glare.
- Good.
- Sabrina.
It's time for your second-chance quiz.
That's it?
No witty remarks, no floorshow?
Well, I didn't have much time to prepare.
Had to buy a belt.
Can we get this over with?
I'm sick of studying.
It takes all the fun out of magic.
Oh, come with me.
I'm gonna take you to the most fun place in all the Realm.
This is the fun zone?
Where are we?
This is grey space.
Or some call it decorator white.
- And we're here because?
- Oh, this is your test.
- Show me the real Sabrina.
- What?
This wasn't in the handbook.
No, no, you're right, but if you studied, well, then you can do this.
I still don't know what you mean, but I'll try something.
Oh, very nice.
That was fun.
Finally, magic is fun again.
Sabrina Spellman, you've learned that magic is a way of life.
- It's a part of who you are.
- I passed?
- But it comes with responsibility.
- I didn't pass.
You showed you're responsible by studying, then you got to have fun.
If I cry, will you tell me?
This is the best part of the job.
Aside from the money.
- I passed!
- With flying colours.
Don't tell anyone I said that.
Woo-hoo!
I'm out of here.
Thanks for everything.
I like that girl.
Can't I just keep the kitty bunk bed?
- Afraid not, cat burglar.
- Mean.
Look, we'll make you a deal.
You have to give back the toys, but you can keep the money you took.
- Really?
- Yes, but you have to invest it.
Go with her.
She'll beat you down.
- I did it.
I passed.
Congratulations.
- I'm so proud of you.
- Give me five.
I can't.
Okay, here it is.
"With magic comes responsibility.
Sabrina Spellman.
Official learner's permit".
Learner's permit?
This is supposed to be a licence.
Who do we call?
Honey, it's right.
Everyone knows you get a permit before you get a licence.
Not me.
This permit means that you're gonna be tested on and off for the next year.
You don't get your actual witch's licence until you're 18 and can pay for the insurance.
Tested all year?
But I can't cut back on Harvey all year.
It gets worse.
If you don't get your licence, you'll become completely mortal.
I know that's bad news for you, but you have no idea how good it is to finally be able tell you.
Great.
If I study, I may lose Harvey, and if I don't study, I'll lose my powers.
This is gonna leave no time for TV.
I've been meaning to bring this by.
I think it's yours.
I don't think so.
Just go with it.
It's a little something from me.
He won't remember a thing.
- Well, maybe you should try it on.
- Maybe I should.
- Ow!
- Sorry.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Ugh.
That one's yours.
Sorry, 30 waffles is my limit.
And that's something I really didn't wanna know about myself.
Let me guess.
A tribute to Belgium?
We're trying to win the great waffle sweepstakes.
Inside one of these specially marked boxes of waffles is a genuine, solid-gold waffle.
Some parts of Canada not eligible.
Oh, good.
I thought you were just wasting time.
When you're finished with the toaster, would you send this to the Other Realm for me?
Oh, man.
You got called for witches' council duty?
Yeah, and I have to send in a postponement letter.
I'm just too busy with my chemistry.
I don't have to do witches' duty anymore.
And that's just one of the perks of being a felon.
Please don't forget to send it.
- What do we look like to you, morons?
Get the camera.
- I promise.
I'll send it.
- Thanks.
Oh, by the way, did you happen to think that the solid-gold waffle might be in the heavy box?
Why don't you come up and see me sometime?
But call first.
Look at him, Sabrina.
Kirk.
Isn't he beautiful?
And it's all on the outside, where it matters.
Hey.
You're on the football team with Kirk.
Tell me everything about him.
- Think he gets athlete's foot a lot.
- Carry me over, sweet Jehovah.
You okay?
You seem kind of down.
I just found out that Joseph Stalin was a bad guy.
Yeah, the whole school's taking it really hard.
No.
It means I flunked my European History exam.
Didn't have time to study now that coach added an extra hour to football practise.
If you talked to him, he'd let you out early.
I did talk to him.
Coach said, "Anybody can read, but you can't teach speed".
Ridiculous.
But I guess that makes sense coming from a guy who wears a weight belt to lunch.
What you writing?
An editorial for school about how too much emphasis is placed on sports and not enough on intellectual achievements.
- Seriously, what are you writing?
- Hey.
- Careful.
Tree in the kitchen.
- Thanks.
Must have spilled some bark extract when I was making a spell for that guy I dated.
- Randy?
- Yeah.
Oh!
I hope it made him a better listener.
Hilda!
You forgot to mail my postponement letter.
I have witches' council duty starting tomorrow.
Oops.
I can't believe this.
I was this close to finding a cure for acne, and now there's no hope for the oily.
Why don't you just take the notice and throw it away and say you never got it?
- I've heard witches do it all the time.
- Because it's wrong.
And I don't wanna set a bad example for Sabrina.
Don't worry.
Watching you throw away a letter is not gonna make me knock over a liquor store.
I mean, I definitely will serve.
I want to serve.
- It's just that now is not a good time.
- Attagirl.
Why couldn't I have been an only child?
What's going on here?
Don't bother looking for your editorial.
I took it out.
It was totally offensive to cheerleaders.
You can't do that.
Valerie's the editor.
Wrong.
I am.
Why is Libby saying she's the editor?
Because I kind of let her be editor for a week in exchange for introducing me to Kirk.
That makes sense.
They do that all the time at the Washington Post.
I know it was a stupid idea, but I really think this is the guy I'm supposed to marry.
- Well, did you at least meet him?
- Not exactly.
Libby pushed his face into the fountain, then blamed me for it.
He seemed more wet than smitten.
The printer's on my way home.
I could take that if you want.
Gee, thanks.
Much better.
Sabrina.
- I really liked your editorial.
- Thanks.
You were my inspiration.
I know.
I just hope coach doesn't find out.
Oh, well.
Blocking-sled drill isn't so bad once you go numb.
There you are.
Hi, Libby.
Thanks for putting my editorial in the paper.
I didn't.
You must have.
And you also must have doctored this ridiculous photo of me.
- I don't even like pie!
- Everybody likes pie.
How can you win a pie-eating contest if you don't like pie?
Sabrina, you have to write a retraction to your editorial.
What?
But it's an opinion.
You can't retract an opinion.
Oh, you can, and you will.
The biggest donations to this school come from high school sports, and I will not let that go away because of some teenage Gandhi.
I think it would be wrong for me to do that.
Look, I am in charge here.
And in order to maintain a free press, you will write whatever I tell you to.
I was sticking up for my boyfriend.
He failed an exam because the coach wouldn't let him study.
- Your boyfriend's name is Harvey?
- Uh, no.
Excuse me, I'm choking.
Sabrina causing trouble again?
Oh, I have seen her type a million times.
- The individual.
- Keep your eye on her, Mr. Kraft.
There's something weird about that girl.
You're a good American, Libby.
You best take cover.
Me and this tree here have some business to tend to.
Shouldn't we call a professional?
Just a suggestion.
Doorbell.
Mr. Kraft, what are you doing at my house?
Well, surprise is a vice principal's only friend.
Hello.
May I help you?
Well, I certainly hope so.
I'm Willard Kraft.
I'm the vice principal of Westbridge High.
SALEM : Loser.
I'm Sabrina's aunt.
Is there some sort of problem?
Well, Sabrina has written a very offensive editorial, and I think it best that she write a retraction to it.
But it's an opinion.
You can't retract an opinion.
That's what she said.
I mean, what is this place, some kind of cult?
And what is going on in there?
We just have a really loud icemaker.
Oh.
Hi.
I was just-- "The holy city which is your face, your little cheeks the streets of smiles".
E.E. Cummings.
- Who are you?
- Willard Kraft, vice principal.
Hilda Spellman.
Not interested.
You know, I've never seen anything like this before.
- It's called a tree.
- Right.
I'm glad our niece is being taught by someone so worldly.
You know, once you get this out of here, the floor's gonna be a mess.
I'd be happy to give you some tips on refinishing, you know, over coffee.
- Or maybe dinner and dancing?
- No.
I know my mother says I'm too dramatic, but this time I'm serious.
If I don't talk to Kirk soon, I will not be able to take in another breath.
Don't you quit on me, Val!
Oh, come on, it was a little funny.
There's gotta be something in here that could help Val.
Aha.
Perfect.
Cupid.
Love is beautiful, love is alive Send me Cupid for just $5.95 You're Cupid?
You don't look like Cupid.
Gee, never heard that one before.
I want you to make him attracted to her.
$5.95.
Let's see here.
- Hey, you just touched my butt.
- I didn't, I swear.
Yes, you did.
You just touched my butt.
If he's gonna fall in love with him, I want my money back.
Wait.
Just wait.
- Hi.
What's your name?
- I I can't remember.
You'll never guess who just asked me out.
Kirk.
- Should I still guess?
- I'm so excited, I can't eat.
I can't even sit down.
I think I'm gonna throw up.
- Hey.
- Oh What's wrong?
Coach was a little hard on me in practise yesterday.
He didn't like your editorial very much.
Oh, no.
He found out I was your girlfriend?
And I bet I know how.
- Maybe I should just write a retraction.
- No.
It would be wrong for you to write something you don't believe in.
No matter how it affects my spine.
Sabrina.
Here's your next assignment for the paper.
Mr. Kraft says you're not allowed to write editorials anymore.
I have to write an article on lunch menus?
No, you just have to transcribe the menus.
Can you handle that?
Sabrina.
I don't even like pie!
You filled Libby's locker with pies, didn't you?
Libby's locker?
Pies?
Me?
You.
And I think this warrants a little time in detention.
- Oh, but that's not fair.
- Oh, Sabrina.
And that would really upset my aunt Hilda, who likes you so very much.
Really?
Why, I didn't get that impression.
Oh.
She's just shy.
Doesn't get out much.
Interesting.
Yeah.
That business about the detention?
Now, that does not have to happen this year.
All right.
Thanks, Mr. Kraft.
Still catnip to the ladies.
Please?
Please?
Please?
Please go out with Mr. Kraft!
No.
He's a goofball.
Now leave me alone.
- He's nice to me when you like him.
- When have I ever liked him?
Well, you did, kind of, today.
But to change the subject, - I think he's suspicious of my magic.
- Then don't do magic at school.
Now, if you don't mind, I'm reading a very important George Clooney article.
- Please!
Please, please!
- No!
- Please?
- No!
Come on.
No.
Please!
Please!
Please!
Please!
Please!
Please!
Never!
Okay, we'll talk about it later.
Phone.
- Hello.
- Hi, may I speak with Hilda, please?
One moment, please.
Salem, what am I gonna do?
It's Mr. Kraft calling for Aunt Hilda.
Start speaking in Spanish and hang up.
Hello.
Hi, Hilda.
This is Willard Kraft.
I was wondering if you'd like to have dinner on Saturday night.
Why, I'd love to, Willard.
That was amazing.
Now do Nixon.
Love is beautiful It's never corrupt Send me the $6 Cupid Unless the rates have gone up I chafe.
Look, I need you to make my aunt temporarily attracted to my vice principal.
No problem.
First, of course, I'm going to need your aunt to sign a release form.
I didn't have to do that last time.
That's because we were dealing with a minor.
Minors don't sue.
Oh, I should say rarely.
But doesn't a release form sort of eliminate the element of surprise?
Yes, I'm sorry, but people never used to sue.
Now the slightest little thing and, boom, I got the nice diaper on and I'm standing in front of a judge.
Sorry, then I guess I just can't do it.
Well, if you change your mind, here's my card.
I also do catering.
Salem, what am I gonna do?
I have to get Aunt Hilda out on that date tonight.
I could go instead of Hilda.
You know me.
Any excuse to wear taffeta.
There's gotta be something in here.
What's this?
"How to make your friend act like a dummy.
Great for parties".
Oh, I know that spell.
The Charlie McCarthy.
They still have their motor skills, but you have to talk for them.
That's perfect.
I'll sneak along on the date and talk for Aunt Hilda.
Will you distract Zelda while I put the spell on Hilda?
Hey, is a dog dumber than a hammer?
That's a yes.
I've been meaning to talk to her anyway.
What is it, Salem?
I don't wanna be late for the witches' council.
Ahem.
Now that you're on the witches' council, I thought I'd show you a different side of Salem.
I can't get your sentence reduced.
No longer the world-domination Salem of the past, but a more charitable Salem.
Shirt-off-your-back Salem.
That's kind of his nickname down at the shelter.
Salem, how do you know Mother Teresa?
Fundraiser.
- Bye, Sabrina.
- Wait.
Where are you going?
- The gym.
- But you can't!
I mean, you don't need to go to the gym.
With that body?
I don't go for my body.
I go to flirt with that cute juice boy.
- Wait!
Aunt Hilda!
- What?
- It's so awful.
- What's so awful?
Uh Being a teenager!
You and Albert Schweitzer.
You and Desmond Tutu.
Salem, these are obviously doctored photos.
It hurts me that you would I can't keep it up.
I don't know those guys.
They wouldn't return my calls.
I just don't wanna be a cat anymore.
Oh, don't cry.
Your fur will mat.
Okay.
I'll put in a good word at the witches' council for you.
- You will?
- Sure.
What's this?
You and Shari Lewis?
Uh, ahem.
That's actually from my personal collection.
There, there.
Be a dummy, be a fool, switch off Your brain, so please don't drool Let me give this a try.
My name is Hilda.
Let me give this a try.
My name is Hilda.
- Cool.
- Cool.
- Oh.
Hilda, you look beautiful tonight.
- Thanks.
- You look totally hot.
- Really?
- These are for you.
- Thanks.
Let's go.
Okay.
You were awfully quiet in the car.
Hi.
Whew!
I mean, what a great place.
Yeah, it's my favourite.
- There's a booth.
- Cool.
What'll it be?
Sweetie, you're gonna have to order something.
I'll have iced tea and the cowboy special.
--from Indiana, and my father-- I'll have an iced tea and a cowboy special.
Fine.
Well, the waitress should be here shortly.
The special?
That's a lot of meat.
Comes with four kinds of beans.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm real hungry.
- My father was a bricklayer, so-- - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm real hungry.
Okay.
Miss?
So I haven't spoken to my ex-wife or my brother since.
You know, this is my first real date since the divorce.
Although the free time has been good for me now.
I've been able to spend some real quality time with my grandma.
I told you that I'm living with her, didn't I?
Yeah, you grossed me out with that earlier.
Enough about me.
Tell me about yourself.
Not much to tell.
I play the violin.
I want you to stop being mean to Sabrina.
I haven't been mean to Sabrina.
Have so.
You've been mean to Harvey too.
Have so.
You've been mean to Harvey too.
Now, I don't know what she's been telling you-- Just promise to quit it.
I promise.
Woo-hoo.
Kind of pushy, aren't you?
I think I like that.
Sabrina!
I'm so glad you're here!
What are you doing here?
Look, you can tell me later.
I'm on my date with Kirk, and I can't go through with it.
- You're here with Kirk?
- I don't know a Kirk.
I peaked.
I was so excited about my date that I got ready too early.
About six hours too early.
Now my hair and my makeup, it's all going downhill.
- You have not peaked.
- You have not peaked.
Really?
You mean that?
- Yeah, you look totally beautiful.
- Your hair looks great.
And that is a totally cool outfit.
Really?
You don't think it makes me look a little too hippy?
- Thanks, I needed that.
- Oh, come here.
- What's on my face, an eyelash?
- Yeah, come here.
- How's this?
- No, closer.
- You are feisty, and I like that.
- Make a wish.
Okey-dokey.
Too much garlic?
Oh!
Oh!
Oh, no.
Oh!
Whoa!
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Save your breath.
Come on, young lady.
You taking me to the witches' council?
No, I'm taking you to your Aunt Zelda.
She's much better at punishing than me.
Oh, Sabrina, how could you put a spell on Hilda?
I think when you threw away that juror letter, it did have a bad effect on me.
I'm sorry.
It was incredibly stupid.
Hey, can my punishment be that I had to eat 2 pounds of steak?
Witches' council resumes in ten minutes.
You know, putting a spell on a guardian is very dangerous.
It leaves us unable to protect you.
What if there was an emergency?
Why are you wearing that awful dress?
You don't understand.
It was the only way I could save Harvey from Kraft.
Oh, so you were doing this to save Harvey?
- Right.
- Is that the only person you were trying to save?
- Yes.
- So it was a totally selfless act?
- Okay.
- Let's see if you're telling the truth.
Sabrina, if you're telling the truth, you'll be able to stay inside the circle.
Looking good.
I'm staying in the circle.
But that's not all.
You have to stay inside the circle while wrestling your conscience.
- That's my conscience?
- Apparently.
Okay, I may have been trying to save myself just a little.
Hey!
I confessed!
Wait!
I'm not in the circle!
Why can't my conscience speak English?
So how'd your date go with Kirk?
Do I get to be maid of honour?
Not yet.
I mean, Kirk's really cute, and he's totally popular, which, by association, would make me slightly more popular, but he only talked about engines.
Could it be I'm not so shallow after all?
- Let's hope it's just a phase.
- Let's.
There is something very, very strange about you and your entire family, and I'm going to keep my eye on you.
Sabrina.
You wanna go to the Slicery after school today?
I'd love to, but I can't.
I'm grounded.
Don't move.
I got a perfect shot at an oriole.
- I hope you've learned your lesson.
- If I say I have, will you dig me up?
- Oh.
It's raining.
We should go in.
I am out of here.
What about me?
Thanks.
Exactly what I need.
A lightning rod.
I'm sorry.
You can't pay me in anchovies.
- And you won't take a cheque.
- Look, I have to be honest with you.
It's more than that.
It's against my principles.
Is it because I'm a cat and she's a woman?
No, it's because you're a cat and she's Shari Lewis.
I can make her so happy.
Besides, she's gotta be tired of that whiny lamb.
- Not even a lamb.
It's a sock.
- You sicken me.
Get a real job.
And some pants.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Salem, those roast potatoes came out great.
Thanks for the recipe.
Don't thank me.
Thank Graham Kerr.
I'd whip up a chocolate soufflÃ© if I could only get my paws around a whisk.
Not to worry.
I'll conjure up some ice cream.
There's an eye screaming in the freezer.
Hilda, you asked for ice cream, and you got an eye screaming.
I think you're coming down with a case of punnitis.
Punnitis?
Me?
No way.
Probably my subconscious telling me I've been eating too much sugar.
Lately, it's become a real monkey on my back.
- Hello.
- Uh-- Do I have Davy Jones of The Monkees on my back?
Definitely.
- Okay.
Maybe I've got a touch of punnitis.
That's right.
No one explain what's going on to the apparition.
I can cancan.
Can you?
So last night my dad sat me down to talk about goals.
- Snore.
- I know.
According to my father, my goals are: pass math, start at least one football game, get a part-time job, and date other girls.
Date other girls?
!
My dad says the teenage years are for getting to know different kinds of girls, so that later on I'll know what to look for in a mate.
Apparently, I'm supposed to watch out for gold diggers.
You really want to do this?
Don't have any choice.
It's either that or military school.
I hear that builds character.
I don't know what to do.
I'm trapped.
Well, I guess we could see other people.
But just as friends.
That's perfect.
And it'll only be for a little while.
I mean, my dad comes up with new goals for me practically every day.
I think last week it was getting through one lousy dinner without a fight.
We'll still be together, right?
Right.
But on the sly.
We'll be like Romeo and Juliet.
Right.
Except for the taking poison part.
Sabrina, we know Harvey's father is a colossal boob.
But we agree with him on this one.
What?
I can't believe you're taking his side.
You're young.
You should try new things, meet new people, have lots of wonderful experiences.
Oh.
That sounds like a lot of fun.
You need to play the field.
Aunt Hilda!
Sorry.
It's that darn punnitis flaring up again.
A fine kettle of fish.
Say it.
Oh, please, say it.
Listen, I know it's painful now.
But later on, when you're ready to settle down, you'll know what to look for in a mate.
You've got to watch out for gold diggers.
I already see Harvey less than I want to.
I don't want to date anyone else.
Why don't you try a nice witch boy?
Let me say this one more time.
Harvey, Harvey, Harvey!
Oh, just give it a try.
Mortal boys we have a plenta.
For witch fellas, we need a Yenta.
Well, okay?
All right.
So Oh, shoot.
So-- So who's looking?
- Are you okay?
- Yes, yes, I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Actually, no.
I just broke up with my boyfriend.
- Is he available for Sabrina?
- Oh.
Oh!
Kidding.
Kidding.
- If this isn't a good time - No, no.
It's-- It's better that I keep busy.
So All right, now, this guy is really cute.
He plays the cello and the flute, - and both at the same time.
- Huh?
- Huh?
- Harvey hates classical music.
Well, then.
Now, this guy, he sails his own yacht.
And lucky for you, he just got over his mermaid obsession, huh?
Wish I could say the same for my ex.
Harvey gets seasick.
Look, who's getting this date, you or this Harvey guy?
Sorry.
Look I think I have to pass.
Oh, Sabrina, some of these boys are pretty cute.
If I were 200 years younger Yes.
And still believed in love.
Look, I just want Harvey and Harvey wants me.
Neither of us can imagine being with anyone else.
You have a date already?
It's not really a date.
My dad set me up with the daughter of one of his clients.
You know, the guy who owns SeÃ±or Beef-o's?
I love that place!
But not anymore.
- Are you gonna be okay?
- Me?
I'm fine.
I have a date this weekend too.
- You do?
- With who?
- You know, the guy.
- What guy?
The guy we met at the place What place?
The place where we Why aren't you good at this?
!
Good at what?
So, what's new with your love life?
Things are definitely looking up.
I just got the brochure from that convent.
Here's the deal: I need a date.
I need one now.
Okay.
By the way, he called.
How about that blond guy?
- No.
Taken.
- Already?
It's Friday at 5.
You snooze, you lose.
You hesitate, you lose a date.
You linger, you-- All right!
There must be somebody.
I have the perfect boy for you.
He's a Cyclops.
Yes, he is, but he's a very good dancer.
He does have a tendency to bite, though.
Look, he's got a date already.
Drag your feet, you don't get to meet-- Just go.
I liked her better when she was depressed.
Roz Chast just slays me.
I know who we can set Sabrina up with.
Pete and Sheila's boy.
What's his name?
What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?
Imagine the grooming possibilities.
Mmm!
Oops.
Sorry.
Still got a little bit of punnitis.
Ahhh.
It's got cat hair on it.
Welcome to my life.
- I remember that boy's name: Dante.
- That's it.
Oh, that's a great idea.
He's adorable.
Smart, cute, laughs all the time.
- Great.
- Of course, we haven't seen him since he was 3 months old.
He must be your age by now.
Dante, this is the coolest vacuum cleaner I've ever seen.
Well, it's great for flying, but it's a little bulky for cleaning under the bed.
These guys are supposed to have the fastest fast food this side of Limbo.
May I take your order?
- Two Gotta Go burgers.
Coming at you.
Wow.
That is fast.
- Two chocolate shakes.
- Right away.
- And we'll split an order of fries.
- Okay.
- Hey!
- Sorry.
It's my first day.
Mind if I smoke?
- I really don't like cigarettes.
- I meant a ham.
I hate to say it, but we're a million light-years from home.
- I really should be heading back.
- Oh, firstclose your eyes.
I got a surprise.
Okay.
Open them.
A star.
It's so pretty.
I was gonna say the same thing about you.
- What are you doing?
- I'm tired of this happening.
I want you to take this punnitis medicine.
Stay away from me.
The last time you brewed a home remedy, it tasted like gym shorts.
- But this is different.
- No.
Ugh!
There.
Oh, I swear.
Sometimes you are such a dictator.
- Hilda - Oops.
Finally.
Someone I can talk baseball with.
I didn't know blind dates were supposed to be fun.
Me neither.
Out a little late, are we?
Get in this house before the neighbours see.
- Good night.
- Night.
So he showed me all the cool spots in the universe.
And then he took me out for hamburgers.
I almost forgot.
I had them save you guys my leftovers.
How thoughtful.
And look what Dante gave me when the date was over.
Oh, what a sweet boy.
I remember the first time a boy gave me a star.
Next thing I knew, three wise men were at the door.
- Well, good night.
- Good night.
Sweet dreams.
She seems so happy.
Remember how we used to stay up Friday night telling each other about our dates?
- We haven't done that in ages.
- I know.
We haven't in ages because we haven't had dates in ages.
Well, at least we have each other.
Oh, my heavens, I'm living with my sister.
I've got to call that Yenta.
- So how was your date?
- Really fun.
But now I'm worried about Harvey.
- Why?
- I don't know how he's gonna take it.
We weren't supposed to like the people we went out with.
Oh, haven't you heard?
He had a great time too.
- He did?
- Apparently, his date's a model or something.
Isn't thatnot particularly good information?
Hey, Sabrina.
You gonna finish that burrito?
I had a great time on my date too.
Oh.
Good.
This is silly.
I mean, we can like other people and still like each other.
You're right.
I mean, we're just doing this for our parents anyway.
We're being awfully grown-up about this, huh?
Very mature.
- So, what's she like?
- Okay.
What's he like?
Okay.
Hey, since we're being so mature about this, how about the next time we go on blind dates, we go together?
Double date?
Great idea.
Looks like everyone's a winner.
- Oh.
- Excuse me.
I have to go listen to one of my mom's Janis Ian albums.
You sure you're all right with this?
- Absolutely.
I'd love to meet - Jean.
Jean.
"Jean"?
I never liked the name Jean.
I never cared for the name Mildred.
I'm curious to see what she's like, but "Jean"?
I mean, Jean's not a name.
It's a pair of pants.
Actually, I think Jean's a very lovely name.
Cheer up, Sleepy Jean Oh, what can it mean To a Daydream believer And a homecoming queen What are you doing here?
Nobody made a pun.
Are you asking me?
Keep it down.
We've got company.
So, what do you say you and I go out, cruise for chicks?
No.
- Dante, come in.
- Hey, how you doing?
You look great.
Wow.
Better lock my vacuum.
So feel like going bowling?
Why not?
There's a first for everything.
You've never gone bowling before?
Are you kidding me?
I've never even been in the mortal realm before.
Oh, this can't be good.
So this is an authentic mortal realm house, huh?
- Man, you guys must laugh all day.
- Yeah.
Light switches, wallpaper-- - My sides hurt all the time.
- Heh.
There's something you should know.
You can't use any magic down here.
- You're kidding.
- I'm serious.
Hey, it's your world.
I'm just bowling in it.
- And these are?
- Stairs.
- Yeah, I knew that.
- But you have to walk down them.
Get out.
Wait here.
I'll grab my bag.
Yeah, I can handle this.
Whoa!
You can still bowl, right?
Let me get this.
You're supposed to roll the ball and hit all those pins without using magic?
Yep.
I don't think it's gonna catch on.
- So who are we meeting here?
- My friend Harvey and his date, Jean.
Jean goes to private school.
Probably has her own credit card.
One of those little Miss Perfects.
Yeah.
So you two have had your share of run-ins?
No.
We've never met.
Hey, Sabrina.
This is Jean.
It is so nice to meet you.
- And this is Dante.
- Hey, cool name.
Jean's awful.
Let's encase her in mud.
- No magic.
- I don't like the guy either.
Leave them alone.
So how about I get everybody a soda?
Ooh!
Walk much?
I think you have a lot of choices.
Look, I have to go.
I have to meet someone.
- Oh, your old boyfriend?
- No.
My therapist.
Now, suffice it to say that a 450-year-old man who washes dogs for a living is not exactly someone that you want to stake your future on.
So enjoy.
On your mark, get set, drool.
Hi.
My name is Steve.
I'm 35 years old.
I have my Ph.D. in astronomy.
- Loser.
- I'm the one looking for a date.
- Why don't you go wait in the kitchen?
- I'll be quiet.
Out.
Now.
Hi.
I'm Jerry.
I'm an attorney.
And I guess the best thing about me is that HILDA'S  I'm a big fat dweeb.
Hilda!
So it was our third date, and Harvey took me to a pizza-eating contest.
Two large pizzas in 15 minutes, including the crust.
We won second prize.
A free calzone.
To this day, whenever I burp, it smells like pepperoni.
Impressive.
I forgot to tell you.
His father's in the circus.
I'm Larry, and I'm writing my dissertation on the Roman poet Catullus.
But on weekends I like to cut loose with haiku.
He doesn't seem so bad.
A big hello to all the ladies out there.
The name's Salem.
But you can call me Dr. Love.
What are you doing in there?
Hey, I got wants and needs that a scratching post just can't fulfil.
Man, that hologram makes me look fat.
Hey.
You want me to get your bowling shoes?
- Thanks.
That'd be great.
- Don't bother.
I already got her some.
- Right.
- I didn't realize you're such a bowler.
- Oh, yeah.
I bowl a lot, at home.
Really?
Well, we'd better get our stuff.
- Cut it out.
- Lighten up.
I'm just trying to keep myself amused.
These mortals are boring.
Hey, I'm half mortal, you know.
Really?
You don't look it.
Who's next?
Hi.
My name's Ron.
I guess my biggest achievement is my Nobel Prize in science.
But I'm not a nerd.
I also have one in literature.
And I do have a dark side.
I've got my fair share of parking tickets.
Ohhh.
Sounds dangerous.
This is the guy for me.
He's smart, he's attractive and he's exciting.
What do you guys think?
Snore.
All right!
Dante, you're up.
Don't worry.
You'll get the hang of it.
- How did you do that?
- Just do it the way I did it.
- Don't worry.
You'll get the hang of it.
- I've never seen anything like that.
Except on The Flintstones.
Flowers?
Champagne?
What did you bring for Zelda?
I hope your sister's half as much fun as you.
Half's about right.
Zelda.
Ron's here!
What do you think?
He's cute, funny.
He's a real dear.
I'm so sorry.
There's something very wrong with you.
You're still going out with him?
Yes.
We're going to see My Best Friend's Wedding.
- Enough?
- You couldn't beat me if you had three arms.
Oh, that so, huh?
- Uhn!
- Man, that was weird.
Look at that.
Oh!
I told my dad these were cheap hats.
Aunt Hilda?
Oh, hi.
I was hungry for some cereal.
Tried to conjure a bowl.
You gotta help me.
Dante's out of control.
He won't stop using magic.
Harvey!
Say, have you tried using a power-outage spell?
Ooh.
Good idea.
Do you think they serve corn flakes here?
Best be heading home.
Good thing I wasn't in the mood for a Baked Alaska, huh?
Shoot!
Man, is it cold here.
You haven't been nice, You haven't been cordial, So for the next five minutes You're gonna be mortal  Hey, you gave me a power outage.
It's a time-out, mister.
That makes it 175 to 16.
You want to go double or nothing?
In a sec.
Four-fifty-eight, 4:59 Five minutes!
Spell's over.
It's party time.
Oh, no.
Time for plan B. Oh, no.
There is no plan B. - Mmm!
- Your hat's slipping.
Harvey!
Sabrina!
I'm beginning to get a real feel for this game.
No!
- Dante?
- What?
- Date's over.
- Fine.
I'm out of here.
What's the point in hanging out with mortals if you can't torture them?
Hooh.
I am done with hats for a while.
Where'd Harvey go?
Uh-- He went home.
Forgot to feed his fish.
I can't believe he'd just leave me.
What kind of guy would do that?
We just went over that.
Harvey.
He said he was sorry.
I thought he really liked me.
Sorry.
Gotta go.
Mm, mm.
Cheese.
Cheese good.
Mmm.
- He seems sort of dumb.
- He's a pinhead.
Rock and rubble, Thunder and wind, Release this poor schlub From his bowling pin - How'd I get here?
- Whew!
Hi, Sabrina.
Mm-hm.
Cheese good.
Mm.
There's a little residual pinheadedness.
Harvey, you look tired.
Maybe you should go home.
- "Home".
Hmm.
- Yeah.
Sabrina, we have to apologize.
I'm sorry we set you up with Dante, that antimortal creep.
He turned out to be nothing but a big bonehead.
Hey.
And they say all puns are bad.
Heh.
Come on.
I got my school pictures tomorrow.
- Great news.
I finally got a date.
- See?
It was just a matter of time.
A third cousin's okay, right?
- Sure.
See you.
- Bye.
- Hey.
- Hey, how you doing?
Have you talked to Jean?
I keep calling, but she doesn't answer the phone.
What'd I do wrong?
Oh.
Hello?
Harvey, it's for you.
Hello?
Jean?
Harvey?
This is weird.
I don't even remember dialling the phone.
But I have been thinking about you.
Really?
Me too.
DAVY JONES : I'll love you this year I'll love you next year And then forever I promised myself I wouldn't cry.
I'll always need you I'll never leave you I'll love you forever You know, these kind of things never happen to Peter Tork.
Why are you smiling?
It's a sad song.
Because I have a date.
With who?
Are you ready, love?
Could we go to a restaurant?
You know, it's been three days, and nobody's fed me.
Okay.
Oh, we've got it.
One last time.
After three, this leg to the left.
- Got it.
- It's like line dancing.
You ready?
One, two, three.
- Ow.
- Oh, sorry.
Davy, do I have to do this next to her?
That's all right.
We had this problem with Micky and Mike, but it all worked out.
Are you ready?
You ready, ladies?
Here-- Here we go.
One more time.
Wait a minute.
One thing.
Who's got their hand on my bum?
That would be me.
One, two, three.
Ready.
I really hope none of my friends come over.
Can I go home now?
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
- Stop.
- What?
Slurping.
You know I can't stand that noise.
Sorry.
I'm finished anyway.
Hey.
Don't throw that used milk out.
Oh.
Impertinent, yet lightly frosted.
Talk about annoying noises.
Clickity click, clickity click.
Fine.
I'll answer my e-mail later.
- You're doing that on purpose.
- I chipped a nail.
Now I'm doing it on purpose.
Ho-ho.
Two can play at that game, sister.
Why, you Care for a little squeaky balloon, my pretty?
This means war.
Ooh-ho-ho-ho.
- Stop!
Can we please have a little peace and quiet around here?
She's right.
Let's get her.
I'm such a nut.
So you think you guys really need some time apart?
Yes, after five centuries of living together, we're starting to get on each other's nerves.
We haven't bickered much since we picked opposite sides in the Civil War.
So why are you two going to the same spa?
- They had a two-for-one special.
- But we have separate rooms.
We're not even gonna see each other.
You packed my toothbrush, right?
Bueno.
Oh-- Hi.
It's Cousin Marigold.
She wants to talk to one of you.
No me.
You talk to her.
- No, you talk to her.
- Uhn!
- Somebody talk to her.
- Fine.
Hello, Marigold.
Uh-huh.
Oh, darn.
We'd love to babysit Amanda, but we can't, we're going away.
Oh, God bless the spa.
Sabrina?
No, no, no, that's a very bad idea.
Sabrina doesn't need $100.
- Hey!
- Could you hold a minute?
It's not worth it, honey.
I wouldn't take that brat for less than a grand.
I think I can handle a 9-year-old.
Sabrina, Amanda's a full witch.
You're half-mortal.
Just a minute.
I wanna do this.
Hi, Marigold?
Yeah, I'll watch Amanda.
Great.
I can't wait.
Okay, thanks.
Amanda says we'll be having fun before I know it.
- Whoa.
- Oh, dear.
Amanda was able to do that all the way from the Other Realm.
Nuh-uh.
I-- I'm just practicing for a beauty pageant.
Ow.
- Okay, you have our number.
- Keep the doors locked.
And don't forget to feed the cat.
I've got it.
Oh, well, Amanda's here.
Hello, I'm here to relinquish a minor to a Miss Sabrina Spellman.
- That's me.
Hi, Amanda.
- Hi.
- I hope she wasn't too much trouble.
- I'm retiring.
Thank you for flying Other Realm Air.
I saved my peanuts for us to have together.
Thanks.
See, we're sharing.
Well, okay, we're off to the spa.
- What do you have there?
- My toy box.
- I never leave home without it.
- Oop!
That's okay, it was just a bone.
Amanda, I have some crayons and colouring books.
Knock yourself out.
Whoa.
I wanna play with this.
Oh, no, Harvey gave me that.
Please, put that down.
- But I'm the guest.
- Amanda, I've asked you nicely.
- Give it to me.
- I wanna play with it!
Okay, you can have it.
That's okay.
I'm sure Harvey's family has other priceless heirlooms.
- Kitty, you wanna play?
- I don't do play.
But you're so small.
I like things big.
Salem?
Amanda, he's not declawed.
Turn him back.
Fine.
I wanted to eat you.
I feel so cheap.
Welcome to Celestial Bodies, where you can feel supernatural naturally.
Complimentary seaweed juice?
Like there's any other kind.
It may be seaweed, but with our special blend, you'll swear it's soy milk.
- Tangy.
- Oh.
It's the seaweediest.
I'll have someone show you to your room.
- Sss-ah.
Roomsss-ah.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
We saw "Spellman for two" and assumed you were married.
But now you see that you were very, very wrong.
Lawsuit wrong.
It is near the ice machine.
Yes!
I win!
I win, I win, I win.
You've beaten me at all these games and yet you remain a graceful winner.
Let's put makeup on Salem.
I'm not playing La Cage aux Kitty.
We've been playing for hours.
I've got an idea.
- Let's play Being Apart.
- No.
I want you to play with me.
Why don't you watch TV?
I said, play with me!
Amanda, get out of the TV.
You're gonna ruin your eyes.
AMANDA : But I wanna play!
- Hey.
- Hey.
What's up?
Not much.
Just yelling at something annoying on the TV.
- I was just invited to a party.
- At 7:00?
Well, I wasn't exactly invited, but people saw me hear about it and didn't warn me to keep away.
You wanna come?
Gee, I'd love to since they went to so much trouble not to ban us, but I can't.
I'm babysitting my little cousin.
Well, I can't go to a party alone.
Let me change that.
I can't go to another party alone.
- All right, someone new to play with.
- Oh, she's so cute.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
What's your blood type?
Oh!
Goody.
Minibar.
Martini?
Don't waste your money on that.
There's a convenience mart right across the galaxy.
You have gotta get into the spa spirit.
I'll have a seltzer with lemon, please.
- Macadamia nuts?
- Now you're pushing it.
There's so much to choose from.
I think I'll have the solar bronzing treatment.
Solar bronzing treatment, confirmed.
- Oh.
I want one of those.
- Solar bronzing treatment, confirmed.
Quit copying.
The point was to spend quality time away from each other.
Solar bronzing treatment, cancelled.
Guess I'll just go with an essential honey dip.
"You are dipped into a human-size beehive.
You emerge soft and supple with just a little bit of a buzz".
Cool.
I'm gonna do that.
Essential honey dip, confirmed.
Hilda, pick something else.
Okay.
Essential honey dip, cancelled.
I'll have the essential honey dip.
Am I confirmed?
Okay.
I can see why you wanted two rooms.
Who ordered the honey dip?
Me.
- Follow me, ladies.
- Ugh.
Why don't we just have someone sew us together?
I hope you get a bee up your nose.
Beep.
Yes!
I win, I win.
Of course, of course.
She always has the right cards.
It's like magic or something.
Just talk.
Nothing more, okay?
I'm from the fourth galaxy of the Other Realm.
Where are you from?
I'm from a big castle in never-never land.
You're delusional.
Harvey.
Hi.
Word's out that there's a party.
Wow, I actually got the word first?
Looks like my popularity standing's on the rise.
I am delusional.
I wanna go to the party.
I wanna go to the party.
No way.
You can't leave this house.
I want to go to the party!
She's kind of having a meltdown.
Maybe you guys should go.
Well, will you act like you're with me?
Sure.
And call me Cookie?
Is something burning?
Let me know how the party is.
So, what do you wanna play now?
A hundred dollars sounded like so much money.
Amanda, I have to clean up.
Don't you have a doll you can play with?
Good idea.
We're gonna have so much fun.
You are in so much trouble, young lady.
Oh!
Want a little more tea?
I'll be right back with some more crumpets.
- This is so humiliating.
- You?
I'm wearing pantaloons.
How did this happen?
I'm the big witch.
Look the other way when you talk.
You're creeping me out.
Here we go.
Okay, Amanda, we've had fun.
Turn me back, I'll help you get ready for bed.
I'm not going to bed, you're going to bed.
And Salem and I are going to stay up and play.
You're not gonna get away with-- - Welcome to the box.
- Who are you?
I was an ice-cream man.
Then I told Amanda we were out of chocolate.
You don't have a cigarette, do you?
I'm Carol.
I used to be her hairdresser.
Now she's mine.
Felt-tip pen.
Ouch.
I'm Dr. Rafkin.
I-- I used to be Amanda's dentist, but now, ahem, I'm a--  An action figure.
- So, what are your powers?
- I sleep about 18 hours a day.
So, what's your story?
Well, I'm Sabrina, and I was Amanda's babysitter.
Sabrina, you're never getting out of here.
None of us are getting out of here.
- I think somebody needs a hug.
- Uh-- It's an accessory.
- Oh, that honey dip was great.
- Mm.
But my bee was such a talker.
She just droned on and on.
Mine was such a name-dropper.
"The queen this and the queen that".
Hi, ladies.
Sorry about the room mix-up.
But this might cheer you up.
I just heard that Madame Eppie Dermis has had a cancellation.
The Madame Dermis?
She's the most famous facialist in all the Realm.
I've heard she has to book her appointments 50 years in advance.
Her technique is so fabulous that your face feels as if it's actually been grafted with baby-butt skin.
- I want a baby-butt-skin face.
- No, I do.
Well, one of you should grab that once-in-a-lifetime appointment.
Dibs!
Wait.
We can't do this.
If one of us takes that facial, the other will always resent it.
You're right.
- It's worth it.
- No.
Oh, fine.
Then we'll both be unhappy.
Yes, unhappy, but free from resentment.
Well, not right away.
Come on, you guys.
There's gotta be a way out of here.
There is a front door, we just never use it.
Where's my other shoe?
You're a doll, you'll never have two shoes again.
I can figure this out.
I've just got to use my Rubber head?
I've got an idea.
Amanda!
Amanda!
- The new ones are so optimistic.
- Could you not talk to me?
What?
I'm playing giddyap with Salem.
Who is it?
Please, someone feed me poison.
Amanda, I have to go to the bathroom.
You're not a Betsy Wetsy.
Was that fresh air?
You're not a Betsy Wetsy, are you?
And up and down, and up and down, and up and down, and up--  I hate my life!
You know, Sabrina, we've all been out of the box.
- Really?
- The problem is, you're still only 10 inches tall and real easy to step on.
I spent two weeks in a vacuum cleaner once.
Ate a penny to stay alive.
She's never gonna change us back.
Dr. Rafkin, superheroes don't whine.
I'm not a superhero, I'm a periodontist.
I drive a station wagon.
Well, it's official.
I'm in hell.
- It's too bad that phone doesn't work.
I do.
- I was Amanda's next-door neighbour.
- Don't ask.
Yak-yak-yak-yak-yak.
Watch my nine, I'm ticklish.
I'll just call my aunts and they'll fix everything.
Love the gingham.
Great!
You can fix everything.
No, I can't.
I'm here to give you a quiz for your witch's licence.
I'm never gonna be happy to see you, am I?
But, Sabrina, this is the perfect opportunity to test you on your witch ingenuity.
Don't make me hurt you.
Get me out of this box.
- And take us with you.
- Or at least take him.
Sorry, guys.
Amanda locked the spell.
Sabrina, your quiz is that you have to get everyone out of this box by yourself.
Now, isn't learning fun?
"Isn't learning fun"?
There's gotta be a way out of here.
I've just gotta think.
I'm blind!
I'm blind!
Sit up.
You're just not used to your doll eyes.
That's better.
Way to go.
That could have entertained us for at least a minute.
Thank you for talking me into buying these.
I love your daisy shoesies.
You know, that noise isn't making me want to rip my skin off.
I know.
It's amazing.
You haven't bugged me in hours.
I think I'm gonna go for a little walk.
You wanna come?
No.
I'm in the mood for a little nap.
Well, then I'll just walk by myself, then.
You know what makes a great sleep aid?
Belgian chocolates.
Okay, I think I have a plan, and I'll need your help.
You can really read people, can't you?
Come on, if we band our talents together, I know we can do it.
There's power in numbers.
It takes a village.
Cry freedom!
Nothing?
I'll help you, Sabrina.
- Whoo-hoo.
- Like we're so busy.
I'm in.
But you should know that I have no upper-body strength.
Come on, Ralphie.
Power to the toys.
Fine.
It'll give me something fresh to be bitter about.
All right.
Power to the toys!
Power to the toys!
Let's get to work.
Salem, time to play cat hospital.
This cotton swab is way too small.
I like things big.
Somebody needs their ears cleaned.
Salem  Okay, everybody, you know what to do.
How do you know when you're bleeding internally?
Hmm.
What else could I do with this?
Ha-ha.
What's that noise?
- Oh, yeah!
- Yeah!
Party!
Oh, please.
I've had enough therapy to know not to fall for reverse psychology.
What's this?
A new toy?
It's kind of small.
Bigger is always better.
Now it's my turn to play.
Oh, yeah?
I'm gonna have my mom stop payment on your check.
- Hello.
- So it looks like I passed, huh?
Yep.
Once again, you got yourself out of the mess you got yourself into.
I'll take that as a "well done".
Now, you're too big for stickers, right?
- Yeah.
- Yes.
More for me.
Toodles.
Hey, guys, gather your accessories.
You're going home.
- Yeah!
Yes!
We're all happy!
- Yay!
And nobody needs to touch me.
Oh, you badly needed a face peel.
This face is so dirty.
There, you dry now.
- Hello, Madame Dermis?
- What do you want from me?
I would like to make an appointment for one of your Realm-renowned baby-butt facials.
Let's see Oh.
I can take you 2:30, Tuesday, April 2nd, in the year 2047.
Great.
Could you maybe call me the day before to remind me?
Yes.
You know, word around the pool is that you have an appointment available today.
- It's taken.
- I figured.
I was just taking a walk and I happened to see your door, so I thought I'd just Hey.
I know those daisy shoesies.
- Zelda!
- I'm not Zelda.
You better show your face.
Oh!
I knew it was you.
I'm so ashamed.
You pretend like you're going to take a nap, but all along you were just going to steal the facial.
- You are so two-faced.
- Me?
You're the one who took a little walk over here to steal the facial.
Stop ganging up on me.
Then hand me my face.
Gladly.
Catch.
Oops.
I ruined your facial.
Gotta go.
Over here.
Hotter.
Colder.
Colder.
Waah!
I'm free!
Now I can go back to fighting gingivitis.
- Did you forget something?
- No.
I was just taking a minute to enjoy my full-size nostrils.
Okay, Amanda, do your stuff.
They were stupid dolls, anyway.
And a lot of them bite.
Finally.
I can stop standing on my tippy-toes.
- What do you say?
- You'll be back.
I mean, sorry.
Now that we're both out of the box, I was wondering, could we go out some time?
Oh, I'd love to, if I weren't so sick of you.
Okay, Amanda, last one.
There.
Happy?
So all that hair is really mine.
Come on, Ralphie, let's get this linen closet on the road.
Boy, there's a voice I'm not gonna miss.
- So long, kiddo.
- Ralphie?
You think I can give you that hug now?
Talk about a broken record.
Well, if it means that much to you.
Okay, I'm done.
Hey, is that a tear in your eye?
No, I'm just remembering that, heh, I have to give up that winter-nap thing.
You know, maybe I shouldn't babysit anymore.
You think?
Oh.
Right, I can bend.
Nights like these make me glad I never had kittens.
- We're home.
- Did you guys have a good time?
- I have no sister.
- No one talk to me.
Aunt Zelda, there's a piece of your cheek hanging off your face.
That qualifies as talking.
Well, I'm glad you guys had a good time at the spa.
I'm fine.
Amanda's fine.
Oh, she's upstairs asleep.
Here are my hundred "I'm sorry's".
Aw.
Here are mine.
You'll notice the "sorry's" in bold.
I still think we need to spend some time apart.
- I agree.
- So I'm going to the Poconos.
Oh, that sounds like fun.
Come on.
It's a big place.
You won't even know I'm there.
Sabrina, you'd better do as I say.
I want water.
I want water now!
Okay.
AMANDA : Thank you.
I do love a happy ending.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Sabrina.
What took you so long?
I had to fight a family for this booth.
I stood by my locker for 20 minutes waiting for Harvey, but then he decided to go hang out with the guys at that stupid garage.
Let's face it.
We've been ditched for loud things that go fast.
What do guys talk about when we're not around?
- Girls?
- Guts.
Guts are way grosser than pus.
Oh, no way, dude.
What's gonna make you yak in a movie, a few measly guts or a geyser of pus?
All right, but generally speaking, guts include pus.
Oh.
- Oh, yeah.
To be or not to bee.
Bzz-zz-zz.
Hey, guys.
The Slicery was dead, so we thought we'd hang here.
Free country.
So how's the car coming along?
We're just having trouble getting it to, you know, start.
Are you using the right key?
Because that's messed me up before.
My aunt Zelda just got her alternator replaced.
- Maybe it's the alternator.
No.
Well, it sure looks rad.
Yeah, you don't see too many low riders in Westbridge.
What does it do exactly?
Rides real low.
Fascinating.
Well, see you.
Let's never do that again.
Salem, what do boys talk about when the girls aren't around?
- Boys or boy cats?
- Is there a difference?
Not really.
Cats might be a tad more political.
Sabrina, when the womenfolk aren't around, men can relax and open up about the big stuff.
- Tell me what the big stuff is.
- Sorry, honey, but in the words of the immortal bard, that's for me to know and for you to stay up nights boohooing because you'll never find out.
- Men.
- Women.
- Cats.
- Ah.
I got it.
I got it.
Hello?
Yes, it is.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
No.
Why didn't you get it?
I'm a lazy bum.
- It was Sabrina's vice principal.
- Is Sabrina in trouble?
No.
He wants to see me again.
I can't believe it.
Last time we went out, I pepper-sprayed him.
And next time, why don't you try this: "I wanna go home now"?
You got a sec?
- Just one.
I've got a lecture to get to.
- I'll make this quick.
What's the mystery of men?
Let me get my calendar and see if I can clear the next decade.
To truly learn how men think you have to be accepted by men.
- Which can't be done.
- Unless You could try a turn-yourself-into-a-boy spell.
- You're kidding.
We can do that?
- No, absolutely not.
The last time she tried a boy spell, she got lost for 50 years because she refused to ask for directions.
Sabrina, I'm against it.
No boy spells.
Got it?
Snips.
Hmm.
Snails.
- Some puppy dog tails.
- Ugh.
Synthetic.
Add a drop of those.
- Ear of newt?
There's a new one.
- Mm-hm.
- "Boy Brew".
- Drink it.
Now, if I drink this will I have boy thoughts or my own thoughts?
Well, you mostly have your own thoughts.
You just look like how you would have been if one of your chromosomes lost a leg.
Okay.
Here goes.
Yikes.
I'm so sorry.
Don't be.
Just means that it's working.
- Really?
I don't feel any-- - Mm-hm.
Oh, boy.
--different.
Whoa.
Do I wanna look in a mirror or is this too weird?
Are you kidding?
It's fabulous.
- Dude.
- Do you feel different?
Yes and no.
I mean, I still feel like me, but for some reason I also sense that SportsCenter is on.
Now, Sabrina, this is very important.
- Each Boy Brew only lasts two hours.
- Gotcha.
Hey, cool chronograph.
Hey, I know what a chronograph is.
Cool.
Heh.
It's just me.
Forgot my notes.
Bye.
Do I smell sweat socks?
No.
I bought cheese.
Bye.
Salem, my man.
Whoa.
Adolescence is not sitting well with you.
I'm gonna walk among you guys, see what makes you tick.
Freeze!
Don't squirt that perfume unless you want to be a boy who gets beaten up.
Man, that was close.
It's not enough to look like a dude.
You have to start thinking like a dude.
- You picked a name yet?
- Kirby?
We're back to getting beaten up here.
- Hey, Valerie.
- Hey.
Do I know you?
Oh, right.
The name's Jack.
Heh.
We sat next to each other one time when homerooms were combined for an assembly on the Boer War.
I don't remember you.
I don't even remember that assembly.
Well, it was nice to see you again.
I hear some dudes are customizing some wheels.
- Don't wanna be late.
- Right.
Hey, did anyone say anything about that war being on a test?
Sweet ride.
You guys need a hand?
Who's asking?
The name's Jack.
I just transferred to Westbridge.
Hey, Harvey Kinkle.
This is Dolrimple, Ramage and over there is Baines.
Jack what?
Jack Spratsky.
Well, just don't stand there.
Give Kinkle a hand.
He got his wrench stuck in his purse strap.
Hey, any of you clowns check the alternator?
Good idea.
So I told him that I felt the answer lies in magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
You'll never guess what he said.
I got it.
Oh.
It's him.
- Thought you turned him down.
- I did.
He must be one of those resilient losers.
I'll be your best friend if you tell him I'm not home.
I'd love to help you in your life.
If only you had feigned some interest in mine.
Okay, Mr. Never-Say-Die.
This calls for drastic measures.
Ohhh.
Women.
Yeah?
Oh.
I'm here to see Hilda.
- Says who?
- Says me.
I mean, I-- I say.
Who are you?
Name's Sonny.
I ride with the Marbleheads out of Marblehead.
And you ain't seeing Hilda.
- Excuse me.
- What?
You mind terribly if I ask why?
Because she's my old lady, poindexter.
Now, if I were you, I'd make like a tailpipe and blow.
I am terribly sorry.
Misunderstanding.
And-- And may I say also that you people just did a swell job at Altamont.
Keep walking, four-eyes.
Keep walking.
You guys check out Troy Aikman last night?
He is so hot.
What's that supposed to mean?
Three hundred and twelve yards, four TD's and no I-N-T's.
Yeah, what did you think I meant, his butt?
Ha-ha-ha.
- His butt.
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.
Harvey, you sick?
No one is coming close to that.
There was greatness there and yet  Hey, Spratsky, are you in?
Yeah, let's see what you got.
- Whoa.
- You're ready for the X Games.
We gotta hang out.
How about tonight?
Can't.
Pushups.
D?
My dad's making me learn how to take inventory.
Kinkle, what's your story?
I might be doing something with Valerie.
Oooh!
Hey.
SABRINA : Can you believe it?
- Harvey wants to date Valerie.
- I thought you and Harvey did agree to see other people.
Sure.
Nitpick.
You're positive he's gonna ask her out?
Salem, he told me to Jack's face.
What am I gonna do?
Plan  Mope.
Plan  Pick up the phone and beat him to the punch.
I recommend the preemptive strike.
It's how I took Yugoslavia.
I'm not asking a girl out on a date.
Not you.
Jack.
It's so unfair.
Why does the guy always have to call?
This is one time when being a cat is better.
Being in heat eliminates the guesswork.
Valerie, what's up?
- Who's this?
- Jack Spratsky.
Spratsky?
Remember, we met in the hall?
The Boer War?
Heh-heh.
Oh, yeah.
Hey, do you think I could borrow your notes?
I didn't take any.
I was too busy looking at you.
- Really?
- Smooth.
You wanna go to the Slicery with me tonight?
Yeah, I'd love to.
Okay, 7:00.
Be there.
Ciao.
She said yes.
And you said, "Ciao".
I know.
Eww.
I have a date with a girl.
- Hello?
- Sabrina?
You'll never guess who just asked me out.
Go with the grain of your fur.
I-- I mean beard.
Dare I say it, Sabrina?
You look fly.
Salem, when was the last time you had a date?
Whoa.
Mama, hearts will be broken.
Can't believe how comfortable I am.
I'm never wearing a bra again.
I can't believe you asked me out.
I mean, I haven't had a date in practically a year.
I mean, I never get asked out.
Never.
Listen to yourself.
This is not what a guy wants to hear.
And second dates?
Forget it.
You'd think I had an unlisted number.
I don't.
It's the same number you called for this date.
So I was just wondering, you know, if anybody else asked you out for this weekend.
You're not a very good listener, are you?
Huh.
So he didn't ask her out, yet.
Hey, Val.
- Dude.
- Dude.
I didn't expect to see you two out together.
Maybe I can scare him off for good.
- Excuse us a sec.
- Sure.
The place mat has games.
Kinkle, I hope you don't mind me asking Valerie out.
- No.
It's cool.
- Good, because, you know, Val and I are kind of going out now.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
But don't tell Val that.
I mean, you know how they are when they get comfortable.
Heh.
Right.
Well, I'll check you two later.
You the man, Kinkle.
Oh.
Are we going Dutch?
Because I only brought $5.
I thought I got rid of you.
Yes, well, this may be what we in the civilised world call bad form, but I have to follow my heart.
Well, did you have to follow it here?
Look, I did not see a ring on Hilda's finger.
Therefore, I must conclude that it is open season.
What if I told you we're common law in Montana?
Ah.
She can do better than some slob in a pair of chaps that haven't fit since Watergate.
Hey, aren't you supposed to be home watching some musical on PBS?
And shouldn't you be using your unemployment cheque to buy raisin jack?
I am not going anywhere until you find Hilda and let her decide.
Don't waste your time.
She's not worth it.
Hey, that's enough.
When Hilda isn't spending my money she's yapping all the time.
You take that back.
- Make me, haircut.
Oh!
- I will.
- Hey, that was my mother's.
- Uh-oh.
You're going down!
This is better than pay-per-view.
What does she see in a slow-witted endomorph like you?
There is more to love than book learning.
Well, I rue the day we met.
What is going on?
Time out.
Break it up.
Time out.
Who are you?
And what are you doing in my house?
Oh, dear Lord, it's you.
- He started it.
- Did not.
Look, you want me to call the police?
Because I have a very good feeling about some outstanding  warrants.
That won't be necessary.
All right.
In that case, I will go.
Please give my regards to Hilda.
And next time I'm pulling your ponytail, suzy.
Did you have to stop it, Zelda?
I had 10 bucks on biker boy.
Why is it every time you're a boy, you have to start a fight?
So how did your big date go?
Great.
We totally hit it off.
I think he really likes me.
That's great, because, you know, I know a lot of times on first dates I make the mistake of talking too much or acting really desperate or putting myself down.
You shouldn't do that.
Okay, I'll try better next time.
Refill?
Hey, Val.
You wanna go to the Slicery with me tonight?
- I'd love to.
- Cool.
- Pick you up at seven?
- Cool.
Hey, do you mind if I go to the Slicery with Harvey tonight?
- He asked you out?
- Oh, no.
I should have asked you first.
No, it's okay.
Harvey and I are seeing other people.
It's just I thought you were dating Jack.
Well, I can juggle two guys.
Wow.
Two guys.
This new deodorant rocks.
I don't know what feels worse, Valerie dating Harvey or Valerie dumping Jack.
I guess I'm just not ready to see Harvey date other people.
Can I give you some advice, man to man?
- I'll try anything.
- Go to the Slicery and mark your territory.
Well, that may be the cat talking, but it works either way.
This must be your lucky night.
How do you figure?
Senior I'm dating got grounded, so you get the privilege of escorting me into the Slicery.
Just chew with your mouth closed and don't let my Diet Coke go empty.
I can handle that.
Little did you know you'd be on a date with me.
Little did you know.
You short guys should wear a sign.
Come on, I wanna play Alley Fight before the eighth graders get the buttons all sticky.
Here's a quarter.
Get yourself something pretty.
Very funny.
I mean, I never get asked out.
Never.
There was one time when a guy who works for my dad-- I wish you would learn that it's never a good idea to turn yourself into a boy.
Oh, there was no harm done.
Except for those four cheese steaks I ate.
Why don't I get rid of Mr. Kraft before we're featured on Cops?
Nope.
That's okay.
I'm kind of starting to like him.
Well, he fought to defend my honour.
Hello, Hilda.
Come on in, slugger.
Sorry I missed you before, but here I am.
Yep.
But I'm actually here to see Sonny.
I-- I just want to apologise for the donnybrook - and maybe buy him a beer.
- I'll go with you.
Oh, boy, that would still be my first choice.
But, no.
I-- I have to clear the air with Sonny.
Otherwise I won't feel right or safe.
Heh.
So if he's not here, I guess I'll just be going.
Oh, he's here.
Yes, he's in the dining room.
I just fixed him a plate of turkey.
- Zelda.
- Hilda, there's no harm.
Then I guess I'll get him.
- How've you been?
- I've been very good.
Sonny, that's disgusting.
HILDA AS  Well, you won't be hearing it much longer.
Hey, man.
What it is and what it ought to be.
Absolutely.
Brewski?
We'll take my hog.
So I guess we're back to never.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I can't hear the ocean.
Keep trying.
It's amazing.
Yeah, never's a really long time to go without a date.
Listen, there's something kind of personal I need to talk to you about.
What is it?
Forget it.
Mine's broken.
Here.
Try the hot sauce.
Get a grip.
Big boys don't cry.
Oh, hey.
Hey, Kinkle.
Jack, are you crying?
No.
I just got a wicked whiff - of some of that pine disinfectant.
- Drag.
So how's your date going?
Oh, it's not a date.
- Can you keep a secret, Sprat-man?
- Sure.
I just wanted to talk to Valerie about Sabrina.
- You did?
- Yeah.
She and I used to go out.
We're still tight, but lately I don't know.
Sometimes I just miss her.
Maybe you should tell Sabrina.
No.
I mean, we decided to slow things down and if I told her, she might feel pressured.
I don't wanna do that.
Harvey, you're the coolest.
- It is kind of piney in here, isn't it?
- Yeah.
Little word of warning, Jack.
Your mascara's running.
Oh, no.
Girl stuff.
I don't have a problem with it, but the guys will be all over you.
Thanks, brother.
Gotta go.
Nice chronograph.
My right side shouldn't be in here.
Please wear off.
Please wear off.
Please wear off.
Huh.
I'm glad to be back.
Ooh.
I'd better hurry.
- Hey, Libby, looking for someone?
- Jack's been in the bathroom forever.
You'd think he was a girl.
Sorry, Libby, but I saw Jack leave about 10 minutes ago.
Sprat split?
I listened to pepper for him.
Doesn't he know who I am?
Hey, Sabrina.
Over here.
Come have a seat.
- Hey, Val.
Hey, Harvey.
- Hey.
You know what?
I almost forgot.
I have to bring some scungilli home for my dad.
Will you two excuse me?
- What's scungilli?
- I don't know.
- You wanna try some?
- Yeah.
Sabrina, you're the only girl I know with the guts to try gross food.
You know what's really gross?
Pus.
So was it worth it?
Yep.
I learned that the mystery of men is there is no mystery.
If you wonder what they're thinking, it's whatever they're eating.
- Any more pork rinds?
- I ate them all.
When is this male-pattern behaviour gonna stop?
Soon.
By tomorrow, you'll be a total priss.
- Come on, you have to catch that.
- He quit on the ball.
He heard footsteps.
If you can't take a hit, if you don't wanna pay the price, then go play soccer.
- Am I right, ladies?
- Dude.
Just call me Buzz.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
I can't wait for our new furniture to get here.
I know.
It's gonna be here just in time for our nice, quiet Halloween at home.
You mean, we're not visiting relatives this year?
Hope, hope.
Nope.
I called them and told them that we just can't make the family gathering this year.
I am so glad.
I hate flying during the holidays.
The traffic getting back to the universe is always vacuum-to-vacuum.
Halloween might actually be fun this year?
Not that Grandpa's game of Find My Teeth isn't without its charms.
We'll rent movies, stir up some candy corn, listen to Jim Nabors, sing Halloween songs.
You're talking about the album, right?
I don't want him at the house again.
MAN'S  Hey, delivery.
Oh, I just love that Other Realm furniture.
It's always delivered on time, and you don't have to tip anybody.
- And there's a 300-year warranty.
Heh-heh-heh.
- Salem.
- If you ladies don't mind, I got a lot of new territory to mark.
Oh.
This is so not me.
How do you get to be friends with those guys?
- I think we'd have to fill in a form.
- You know what I'd say to Asher?
- What?
- "Hello".
That would take guts.
Hi, Asher, guess what.
I'm having a Halloween party - Friday night.
- Really?
It's gonna be awesome.
Great food, a DJ, me.
- And you know what the best part is?
- What?
No freaks.
Gee, you think she wanted us to hear that?
Don't let Libby get to you.
Just tell yourself what I tell myself: These are the best years of her life.
Hey.
Did you hear?
Sabrina's having a Halloween party.
- Really?
- Yeah.
And it's gonna be great.
Music, dancing and other things cool people do.
Heh.
I'm glad to know the B-list people have someplace to go.
Is she inviting teachers as well?
Sabrina's bash is gonna make your party look like a civil-service exam.
Wow, Sabrina swore she'd never have a party.
Really?
Hey, Sabrina, great news about your party.
- Party?
Whoa, party?
STUDENT 1: All right.
STUDENT 2: Whoo-hoo.
Sabrina, you might want to know, - you're having a Halloween party.
- What?
Well, I would've said my house, but I was afraid my parents would dance.
I can't have a party at my house.
Why not?
Your house is cool.
It's old, gothic, kind of spooky.
Right, it's all wrong for a Halloween party.
You have to tell them it's not happening.
- So when's the party, Sabrina?
- Uh Sabrina might not-- Probably is definitely not having the party  Aww.
almost.
So you were just making the whole thing up?
Well, what I was doing was, I was-- Telling too soon.
She wasn't supposed to tell until I asked my aunts.
So you still might have the party?
It all depends on what my aunts say.
Of course you can have a party.
A mortal Halloween, how quaint.
I need you guys to tell me no.
Don't you want to spend a quiet Halloween at home?
This is more important.
Your first party.
Why don't you have kids over more often?
Because, like most teenagers, I'm self-conscious about the fact that we're witches.
Yes, but we're people too.
Now, don't worry, we'll make sure no witchy stuff happens during the party.
Come on, think about it.
All your friends having fun, dancing.
Actually, I think it would be fun to have some people over.
You know, be normal for once.
And if all goes well, you might just go from normal to toast of the town.
And if anything goes wrong, we could always move to another town, right?
- Sometimes it's so hard to be young.
- I know.
But I think I handle it pretty well.
- Salem, those are for the guests.
- Mm.
I'm just making sure all is right.
Cheetos should be served at room temperature, you know.
Sabrina, phone call.
- It's a boy.
- Can I lick the bowl?
Yes.
Of course, you'll be horribly burned.
Hello, party central.
Hey, Sabrina, it's me.
I've got some bad news.
- I can't come to your party.
- What?
My mom and dad said I have to take my brother - and his friends trick-or-treating.
- You're kidding.
- Did they just spring this on you?
- Yeah, they just reminded me that they told me about it two weeks ago.
So they're totally to blame.
I got a bad feeling about all this free candy.
My little brother gets hyped up just eating an apple.
Oh.
I'll see you later, I hope.
Great.
Harvey can't come to my party.
He's the only guy I had confirmed.
FEMALE  Here we go again.
- Sabrina, did you turn on the TV?
No.
That's weird.
What are you putting in the candy corn?
MSG.
What could it hurt?
- What's the matter?
- Our furniture.
It's talking.
Could you people bug off?
Marvin, could you possibly be nice - to the new owners for a change?
- Aw Couches are from Mars, chairs are from Venus.
All this from a 26-year-old who still lives with his parents.
I've been looking for a place.
Think it's easy?
Thank you.
What the heck is going on here?
Apparently we accidentally bought talking furniture.
Do you want to say "duh," or should I?
Talking furniture?
What, were they people that were turned into furniture?
Of course not.
Where would you get an idea like that?
It's just furniture that talks.
That's right.
We're sideshow acts.
We have personalities and feelings, you know.
- Yeah.
- And we're great for single people.
And I can't wait to get to know each and every one of you.
- Zap them back.
- Why?
They could be fun.
- Aunt Zelda, my party.
- Okay.
- That's odd.
- What's the matter?
I know.
We put them on our credit card, and until they're paid off, we can't zap them away.
Well, I have a suggestion: Do something.
Please?
We'll just go back to the store and tell them they made a mistake.
Come on.
Okay, well, don't be too long, because I don't like being left alone with furniture I hardly know.
Here, you just relax, dear.
Phew.
Hmm!
Creepy.
Oh, I forgot everything is closed in the Other Realm on Halloween.
Except Denny's.
Let's have some pie.
No.
We'd better get back home.
Sabrina may need our help.
But pie Are you gonna put that there?
Yes.
Do you have a problem with that?
No, no, don't let a sense of style ruin your design.
How would you like to spend the rest of your life in a garage sale?
Ha-ha-ha-achoo-hoo!
A couch who's allergic to cats?
Finally, someone whose life is more pathetic than mine.
Oh, thank goodness.
Well, guys, it was nice knowing you.
Be sure to write.
I'm sorry, but everything is closed in the Other Realm.
- We can't zap them away just yet.
- Ugh.
But they can't stay here, I have mortals coming over.
Well, we'll just take the furniture - down to the basement.
- And burn it?
Calm down, calm down.
We'll just leave you there for the duration of the party.
No one will know that they're there.
We once kept a Viking down there for centuries.
Oh, we did let him go, didn't we?
Oh, yeah.
Remember when we-- I'm sure it's a cute story.
Why don't you tell it after we move the furniture.
Stop it.
Stop it.
I'm ticklish.
Maybe you should start with the striped chair.
He has no sense of humour.
I don't think that's funny.
Hey, be gentle.
Watch out for my arms.
Hey.
SMALLER  Get me out of here.
Get them off me.
All right.
- All right, calm down.
- Ouch, ouch, ouch.
- What is it?
- What's the matter?
- Ouch, ouch, ouch.
- We've got termites.
So spray something.
That won't do any good, these are Other Realm termites.
Talking furniture attracts them.
- Look.
- Help me.
- Are you gonna finish that knothole?
- Bah!
Get them off me.
This is bad.
This is really bad.
The furniture talks, the termites talk, I haven't finished decorating   And now the party's starting.
Just get the door.
- We'll think of something.
- Alert the authorities, I beg you.
Oh, pipe down.
Quack, quack, quack - Hi, it's me, Valerie.
Heh.
- Great costume.
I thought I'd get here early and help.
That way I would intentionally be the first one here instead of accidentally being the first one here.
I'm the first one here, aren't I?
- Yup.
SMALLER  I don't wanna die.
- Who's that?
- My aunt.
She's having a midlife crisis.
My dad had one of those, he bought a red car.
So, what can I do?
Um Go in the kitchen and fill some bowls with pretzels.
Okay, sure.
Sabrina, thanks for going through with this.
You're a good friend.
Thanks, Valerie, and don't worry, it's gonna be a great party.
And normal, very normal.
I swear, I will knock the stuffing out of you.
We're starting her on hormones next week.
How about those pretzels?
Now, don't forget to say "thank you".
What have we here?
Trick-or-treat for UNICEF?
Thank you.
Excuse me, but I am not going back to the basement.
Take it easy, Chair.
Okay, for now, the termites are confined to the basement.
Can't we call a magic exterminator?
No, it's a holiday, and they're very devout.
Got it.
For the time being, we could feed the termites our old, used furniture.
Yeah!
- We'll start with the old lawn chairs, the coat tree and Salem's scratching post.
- Hey.
- It's a birthday present and you never use it.
You never use the Waterpik I gave you.
Let's not get ugly.
It's for the sake of Sabrina's party.
Or the tea cosy Okay, look, guys, this is my first party, and I really need it to go well.
My aunts will keep the termites at bay.
If you behave yourselves and not say a word, I promise I'll I'm talking to furniture.
Okay, listen up, you upholstered losers.
If you misbehave for just one instant, I'll cut you, man.
Hey, guys, happy Halloween.
Thanks for coming.
Coming through.
Just working on my triceps.
Okay.
Well, help yourselves.
There's chips, soda, cookies, raw vegetables-- How'd those get there?
Sabrina, I love your bubbling cauldron-- - Aw, shoot!
- Valerie, wait.
Uh-- Okay, I'll be back in a minute.
Everyone have a good time and talk amongst yourselves.
I mean, the people talk.
Nothing else should talk.
And why would it?
Gotta go.
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
I'm a duck.
No one else here is a duck.
Dave's got a little alligator on his shirt.
It's not the same.
I always do stupid stuff like this.
Why'd you have to have this party in the first place?
Couldn't help myself.
From now on, I'm gonna be a total recluse.
I'll create this mystique around myself that people will find really fascinating, but they'll never see me in public.
Or you could just take the costume off.
I can't.
My mom sewed me in.
Sabrina, more guests have arrived.
Are any of them wearing Halloween costumes?
I'm sorry, honey.
One boy's wearing a cap.
Why didn't I take my little brother's teasing seriously?
Hey!
Stop egging that house!
Come back here, I mean it!
You know, they try juveniles as adults in this state now!
Everyone having a good time?
- What is that music?
- I don't know.
It was on the stereo.
- It sounds like Jim Nabors.
- No.
And certainly not him in person.
I know what this party needs: candy corn.
Heh.
Aunt Hilda, it was a very nice gesture, but in case you didn't notice, we're not 5 years old.
Yes, I'm very aware of that, but if I were you, I would really play up the candy-corn angle.
- Why?
- Follow me.
Is that the antique rocker my mother gave me?
- Yes.
I'm going to feed the termites.
- Do it.
What happened?
Well, we tried to double the recipe, and we accidentally squared it.
- Well, zap it away.
- I tried that, but it didn't work.
Does the recipe book have any answers?
Oh, there's a chapter called "What to Do If You Make Too Much Candy Corn".
What does it say?
"You can never make too much candy corn".
No!
Don't come in here!
No, no, no, Zelda's naked!
It's that midlife thing again.
I'm so glad you decided to come downstairs.
No, I'm just here to announce that I am now officially insane.
I could have sworn I heard a doorbell coming from inside your linen closet.
Oh, well, that's where I keep my wind chimes.
And it does get a little draughty in there.
Heh-heh-heh.
Excuse me.
Ah.
MONSTERS : Ya-la-la-la-la Oh, Halloween carollers.
Listen, we're kind of in the middle of something, so could you just make it a quick Halloween carol?
Great.
On the 12,000th day of Halloween My true love gave to me - 12,000 eyeballs - 1 1,999 ear of newt But I just came to tell you about the doorbell and now I'm leaving.
- No, you have to stay at the party.
- No, I can't, I can't.
You have to help me out here.
- But they'll laugh at me.
- Well, at least they'll be entertained.
- All right, I guess I owe you.
- Thanks.
Trick-or-treat.
Huh?
I said, trick-or-treat.
Quizmaster, not now, not tonight.
Well, when you least expect it, the perfect time for a quiz.
Would it help if I said I was having a party?
Oh, yes.
This is a party?
Man, I've been to Amish quilting bees that were more happening than this.
And when are you appearing at the Laugh Factory?
Candy corn?
What am I, 5?
- Just give me that quiz, now.
- Okay.
Pop-quiz challenge number one: - make me a pumpkin.
- Whatever you say.
This is not what I meant.
- You want me to hollow you out now?
- No.
Turn me back, woman.
Not funny.
Come on, you have to admit that was pretty impressive.
What if some kid had come around with a baseball bat?
- Can I go back to the party now?
- No.
I have one more question.
What?
Can I use your bathroom?
- Down the hall, on your left.
- Thank you.
Oh, now what?
Halloween carollers from the Other Realm.
They promised me they'd be quiet if I gave them some candy corn.
Valerie, how's the party going?
People are reading, you'd better do something quick.
I'll be right there.
Heads up, lady with a plank.
- Ooh!
Mmp!
That's it.
I've tried to be a normal teenager and have a normal social life, but it's no use.
I might as well face it, this party's over.
- Hey, is the party still going on?
- Oh-- Absolutely.
Come on in.
Thanks.
We'll give it a few minutes.
Wow, a cool guy came to your party.
I'm a duck.
So, Sabrina, this is your party, huh?
Yeah.
We have to get people to dance.
- Okay, let's make room.
- Okay.
Know what?
Why don't we just dance around the furniture?
It's all the rage in New York.
Oh, no.
Oak veneer.
I knew it wasn't the real stuff.
So how about some tunes?
Well, the stereo's kind of on the blink right now, but I think I have a transistor radio somewhere in the house.
Well, you know, Libby's got a DJ at her party.
Maybe we should all go there.
Yeah.
- No, come on, guys, stay.
We don't need music to dance.
Oop.
Valerie?
Valerie, are you all right?
Quack once for yes, twice for no.
I'm okay.
The tail-feathers broke my fall.
Weird.
These look like bite marks.
What could have caused them?
Termites.
Listen, everyone, I can explain.
And they would be?
Oh.
And that is?
Cool.
Sabrina, how did you rig all this Halloween stuff up?
It's awesome.
Oh, a little imagination and some yarn.
It's really inventive.
I mean, everyone's done spaghetti brains, but a river of candy corn?
Salem, nobody knows that this stuff is real.
Excellent.
Attention, kids.
I urge you to accept me as your ruler.
Wow, the cat talks.
Say,  "Asher.
Asher".
Loser.
Loser.
Cool party, Sabrina.
Could someone help the duck?
I'm so glad some other people decided to wear costumes.
Ha-ha.
Hey, thanks for eating those termites, pal.
No problem.
Taste like frog legs.
Thanks.
I think I'm suffering from post-traumatic trick-or-treat syndrome.
That's too bad because I've had a very restful evening.
This next song is ladies' choice.
I know what will make this night really perfect.
Wow.
It's the 10,000 Maniacs.
On bended knee I've looked through Every window then Touched the bottom The night a sleepless day instead A day when love came Came easy like What's lost now found Beneath a blinding Okay, so I forgot how good this stuff is.
What are you still doing here?
Is there another quiz?
No.
In fact, I have a confession to make.
I didn't come here to quiz you tonight.
I came because I had to work, and, well, all my family's way on the other side of the Realm.
And, well, I kind of get lonely during the holidays.
That's sweet.
So, what you're saying is, you gave me a quiz when I was having a nervous breakdown for no reason?
Basically.
Mind if I dance with the duck?
I crashed through mirrors I crashed through floors Of laughter then Libby, you're at my party?
Please.
I only came by to see the largest gathering of weirdoes ever.
Is that 10,000 Maniacs?
Yeah.
Why don't you call them weirdoes to their faces?
Heh.
I heard her party's been over for hours.
A bunch of kids egged her house.
And you would save me I throw a great party.
And I held you Like you were my child We were, we were We were, we were without In doubt We were, we were We were, we were without Saving for a rainy day Rainy day
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Can I have more mashed potatoes?
- Of course.
- And I'll have more meat.
- Another roll, please.
- And I'll have more meat.
Hey, what's a cat have to do around here to get something dead?
Salem, you've had enough to eat already.
No offence, but you're turning into a furry blimp.
Moi?
I'm as lithe as a jungle cat.
Besides, so far today, I've only had ten of the 12 food groups.
What's left?
Chocolate and lard?
Maybe you should try dieting, Salem.
I don't need to diet, because I am not fat.
I am big-boned.
- Need a push?
- You laugh, you die.
Nobody takes me seriously.
Please.
One little egg.
A scrap of sausage.
The crumbs from your toast.
No.
It's not healthy for a cat to be overweight.
We're making you diet because we care about you.
Let me just lick the jam off your knife.
Oh, find some self-respect.
Where are my Landlubbers?
Refrigerator?
What is she talking about?
Landlubbers.
The classic bell-bottom pants that I wore at the San Francisco Be-In in the Summer of Love during the Age of Aquarius.
- Again, what is she talking about?
- The '60s.
Oh, right.
Peace, love and no bathing.
I'm sorry, Hilda.
I threw those pants out years ago.
You never wore them.
I've been waiting 30 years for hip-huggers to come back in.
Now they're back and my hips remain unhugged.
- Can't you buy another pair?
- No.
That company went out when straight-legs came in.
- Sorry about your bell-hugger hips.
- Hip-hugger bells.
Kids today just don't know history.
Oh.
I gotta get to school.
Where's my lunch?
Not half-eaten and hidden in this drawer behind me, that's for sure.
Quiet.
I would say, "Good morning," but I work in a public high school.
So there are no good mornings for me.
BOY : Loser.
Heard it.
Now, your English teacher, Mrs. Reilly, had her baby last night, so she will be on maternity leave for the next six weeks.
Thank you, Bill Clinton.
Anyway, I will be taking over the class for her while she breast-feeds and bonds.
Starting tomorrow, - there will be a quiz every day.
Aww.
And tomorrow's will be on the first three chapters of The Waging of War by General Heinrich von Schlecht.
But we were studying Emily Dickinson.
Well, then, I got here just in time, didn't I?
The Waging of War.
Six hundred and fifty-one pages of blood, sweat and blood.
At least we only have to read the first three chapters.
It only has four chapters.
Vanilla again?
When do they change yogurt flavours at this school?
Well, one day last year, they changed it to pistachio.
No, we thought it was pistachio.
Turned out the machine just needed cleaning.
Eww.
- Excuse me, Mrs. Poopiepants?
It's Poupiepenz.
It's French.
Oh, well, we were just wondering if it were possible to maybe get some new flavours in the yogurt machine?
There you go.
Mocha.
Why do we bother expressing our opinions when no one ever listens to us?
Maybe it's your voices.
They make a sound only other freaks can hear.
Class.
Don't forget to visit the college fair this week.
Everyone can have a rewarding career, regardless of colour or gender, but not if you're an uneducated dolt.
So please, think of this as a week of discovery, and not just an excuse to miss class.
How about you doing an article on college week for the paper?
You know, which booths were the most popular, who's going where-- Which booths had the best snacks.
Boy, you really don't flee from controversy, do you?
You know, Val, you're doing a great job as editor.
You're really confident.
Really?
Could you tell my mom?
This is the young lady I was telling you about.
My star Algebra 2 student, Sabrina Spellman.
Heh-heh.
Your cheque's in the mail.
Huh?
Oh.
So, Sabrina, you've thought about Franklin & Lee?
It's one of the oldest colleges in America.
A very long tradition of academic excellence.
Hey, look at all the brick buildings.
Franklin & Lee delivers a fine education and turns out leaders.
Being a leader sounds good.
Why don't you take home one of our packets?
I think you might be Franklin & Lee material.
Cool.
If you really mean that, can I have a bumper sticker?
One can for breakfast, one can for lunch, then corn for dinner?
I'd rather get locked in the dishwasher again.
- Sabrina, my love-- - No.
And I know you ate my lip balm.
Let it go.
It was a pair of pants.
They were my favourite pair of pants that I've ever owned.
Ugh.
I am not being a broken record.
Those were my favourite pair of pants.
Hi, Sabrina.
- Oh, The Waging of War.
- Funnier than I would have thought.
General Heinrich Von Schlecht.
What a loser he was.
- You knew him?
- I dated him.
Oh, he could take over a country, but he couldn't pick up a cheque.
Man, well, then let me talk to your supervisor.
Hey.
Time for another check on my magic?
Hmm?
Oh, yeah, yeah, I guess.
- I'm trying to get my landlord.
- You have a landlord?
What did you think, I lived in a magic lamp?
Actually, I did.
- So, what's up?
- Got a mouse in my apartment.
Well, why don't you just catch it and set it free outside?
Oh, it's an Other Realm mouse.
Try 275 pounds.
I'd like to see its exercise wheel.
Okay, look, your assignment is to brew up something from the new home supplement to your magic book.
"Brewing and Concocting With Too Hot Tamales".
Yes.
Spells that not only work, but have a lovely presentation.
Time ball?
What's a time ball?
- That's one of our favourite recipes.
- We learned it on our trip to Atlantis.
- So, what does a time ball taste like?
- You don't eat it.
You hold it, and your surroundings become whatever decade you think of.
Cool.
Hey.
Remember those snakeskin tacos?
- Yum.
- Oh, the best.
I want that mouse out.
Now, he makes long-distance phone calls, he listens to my CDs, doesn't put them away, and he chewed a hole in my couch.
Oh, now, he denies it, but I know it was him.
Whether he contributes to the rent or not is beside the point.
- It smells like sardines.
- Well, if it smells like sardines, - then you made it right.
- Thanks for your help.
Okay.
Guess I can go get Aunt Hilda's jeans.
Sixties, here I come.
Groovy.
Made a time ball, huh?
Guess you passed.
Got a fro pick?
Like, totally groovy.
I'd like to buy these pants.
Far-out.
I'd be happy to barter if you've got any sketches or poetry.
- All I have is money.
- Wow, that's such a metaphor.
Thank you.
Well, it's the end of an era.
Wow.
Customs was a breeze.
Look.
- My pants.
How did you get these--?
- Time ball.
Oh, I wondered why we were in the '60s a minute ago.
So everyone knew the time changed?
No, only witches.
Mortals are under the spell.
But it was nice to drink Tab again.
I wonder if there's any left?
Check the cabinet.
How sad is this?
Darned canned chilli.
Here's my Christmas list: can opener.
But you wouldn't be able to use a can opener.
To hit you with.
I'm on page 270.
How about you, Harvey?
Nineteen?
Maybe we should hang up.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Read.
And turn off ESPN.
Good night, time ball.
Can it be true?
Do I smell sardines?
It doesn't look like sardines.
Oh, who cares?
Oh.
I don't feel so good.
Maybe I should have chewed that thing.
And I'm too full to lick myself, so maybe I should just watch a little TV.
Hmm.
What's on at this hour anyway?
Infomercial.
Infomercial.
Oh, Hawaiian talk show.
Nope.
Infomercial.
Yes.
The Mod Squad.
And it's a '60s marathon.
An entire night of Peggy Lipton.
Be still, my heart.
Be still, my stomach.
Where did this come from?
What's going on?
How did I get back in the '60s?
Where's my time ball?
Oh, no.
Bummer.
This wheat germ is excellent.
I really feel it invigorating my chi.
Something's wrong.
Something's only wrong if you believe it's wrong.
Heavy.
Sabrina, we think it's beautiful you're playing with the time ball again.
I haven't.
That's what's wrong, whether we believe it's wrong or not.
The time ball's missing.
What are we gonna do?
If we don't find the time ball, we can't reverse the effect.
Then we'll be stuck in the '60s forever.
All right, mellow out.
The only thing that's forever is our love for you.
- Very heavy.
- Very creepy.
Mmm, oh.
Solid.
Fresh laundry, still warm from the dryer.
Oh-ho.
Oh, to sleep, perchance to dream of Peggy Lipton.
Mmm.
Mmm.
You better get to school, or the man will lay a trip on you.
Do you have to talk like that?
It's hard not to get swept away dressed like this.
But don't worry.
We'll just fill the house with positive vibes, and the muses will guide us to the time ball.
And looking.
Don't forget looking.
Peace.
What was she doing?
Measuring to see if my skirt was long enough.
I passed.
Wouldn't it be easier to just wear jeans?
You're serious.
Girls in pants at school?
You come up with some wild ideas, Sabrina.
Hey.
Guess what I just bought.
- A '63 VW Bus.
- All right.
That's a good thing?
Well, it only goes 38 miles an hour, but it is so out of sight.
- Are you gonna paint it?
- You bet.
- Totally psychedelic.
- Oh, yes.
- Peter Maxx to the max.
- You're blowing my mind.
Well, don't make a mess.
I have to make a phone call.
I'll meet you guys in class, okay?
Far-out.
Dial?
These people were living in the Stone Age.
- I found my 12-string.
- Far-out.
Peace and love to you, whoever you are.
Did you guys find the time ball yet?
Oh, right.
The time ball.
Oh, yeah.
I meant to look for that, but I got involved in my macramÃ©.
Sorry, sister.
Look, it's round, it rolls, it could be anywhere.
Is that a haiku?
Listen, that's the bell.
I have to go to class.
I'll check in with you guys later.
- Didn't you guys hear the bell?
- That bell is the man's bell.
Okay, but you did hear it, right?
What's wrong, Sabrina?
You seem so uptight.
I'm just nervous about the quiz on The Waging of War.
We have to stop the war.
Stop the war.
ALL : Stop the war.
Stop the war.
- Absolutely.
Right on.
- Mr. Kraft?
- Power to the people.
Yeah.
I have a question about the quiz today.
A quiz?
No, no, no.
A quiz can only test you on what you've been told, not who you are.
So does that mean it's open-book?
You know, I think I'm gonna take the whole class outside today, because we need to continue our discussion on the dangers of America becoming a police state.
Isn't this an English class?
No.
This is a life class, Sabrina.
Life is a life class.
Heh.
Oh.
Heavy.
- Huh?
It's like a song.
In fact, sing with me, everybody.
What shall we sing?
- "Kumbaya".
"Kumbaya".
You're beautiful, Harvey.
Okay.
Someone's loving.
ALL : Someone's loving, Kumbaya Beautiful.
Someone's dreaming.
Someone's dreaming, Kumbaya Louder for extra credit.
Someone's loving, Kumbaya Outside.
Someone's loving-- Okay.
This is weird, but at least it's not a test on a fat book.
Kumbaya  Peggy Lipton.
Peggy, don't fall down.
Freeze, sucker.
Peggy.
Kumbaya Kumbaya, my Lord - What's this?
- A sit-in.
Against the war?
No.
Against the lack of vegetarian food on the cafeteria menu.
We will not eat our female friends.
Yeah!
Are you in?
If you're not a part of the solution, then you're part of the problem.
No beef.
ALL : No beef.
No beef.
No beef.
It's so exciting to be part of this movement.
And tofu will grow on you, right?
No beef.
No beef.
I have a message here from the principal.
Starting tomorrow, the cafeteria will serve vegetarian meat loaf, fish sticks and meatless sloppy joes.
I also have a message from your parents.
Get off the floor.
Sloppy joes?
How about sloppy sues, sexist pig?
Oh, shave your legs.
Wow, they listened to us.
I can't believe it.
No successful guy is gonna wanna marry a radical, Sabrina.
Boo!
- Oh, boo all you want.
Grooming, shopping and social climbing are grand traditions that will never die.
Freaks.
Hey, we're all freaks.
- And proud of it.
- Freak power.
ALL : Freak power.
Freak power.
Freak power.
Freak power.
I like this decade.
Freak power.
Freak power.
Freak power.
BOTH : Om  I hear bells.
Have I reached nirvana?
- It's the phone.
- Oh.
Hey, guys, don't worry about finding the time ball.
I'm having a blast.
We don't have to go to class, everyone hates Libby, and except for the fact that a few people smell, this era rocks.
Here's the article I wrote on college week.
Why are you giving it to me?
You're the editor of the school paper.
Me?
I'm a girl.
I am secretary of the Future Homemakers of America Club, Chapter 732.
Would they like this article?
Here you go.
I think I'm ready to let Franklin & Lee turn me into a leader.
I beg your pardon?
- I filled out the questionnaire.
- How nice for you.
Why don't you just take it over to the Sarah Lawrence booth and let me do my job?
Hey, Franklin & Lee, fella?
We build leaders of tomorrow at Franklin & Lee.
But I think I wanna go to Franklin & Lee.
Listen.
Franklin & Lee is a men's college.
Now, I understand if you wanna get your M-R-S, but we still can't let girls in.
M-R-S?
Missus?
You think I want a husband?
Something wrong, Sabrina?
I'm so offended.
Franklin & Lee won't talk to me because I'm a girl.
That's because men rule the world.
And they do it by oppressing women.
Forcing us into stereotypical roles and shoes that create permanent foot problems.
Here.
Let's take off our bras and burn them in defiance of the misogynistic patriarchy.
You know what?
I have to meet Harvey, but maybe we can burn our underwear together later.
Oh, Sabrina, remember.
A woman without a man is like a fish without a bicycle.
Look what I got.
- What is it?
- It's a new cartridge for my 8-track.
I can't believe we can listen to tapes while we drive.
Yeah, what's next?
Car phones?
Hey.
Something wrong?
Yeah, I'm sick of living in this stupid backwards decade.
- Backwards?
- A major college won't even talk to me because I'm a woman.
Why do you need college?
Let's stick to our plan.
After graduation, we load up my bus and travel the country, just following the music.
That's not a plan.
That's a bad vacation.
What about my future, my career?
You don't need a career.
You're my lady.
We'll grow our own food.
You'll have my children.
And someday, if it's not too much of a hassle, I might even marry you.
I'm sorry.
I stopped listening after, "My lady".
Isn't it fun to eat cheese without knowing that it's bad for us?
You know, this fondue pot would make a great wedding gift.
We've gotta find that time ball.
Hey, chicks.
What's the haps?
Yum.
Fondue.
- I smell sardines.
- Interesting thought, but sardines and hot cheese are not a combo you're gonna wanna put together.
No, I smell sardines on your breath.
Salem, you ate my time ball.
No, I didn't.
What time ball?
- The one I left on my desk.
- Oops.
I mean, what time ball?
All right, fork it over.
Yeah, Salem, I am getting really sick of sitting on the floor - with my legs crossed.
- What am I supposed to do?
It's in my stomach.
Well, by now, my duodenum.
- In any case, you're not getting it.
- I know just what to do.
This better not involve a rubber glove.
- Just getting your fur-ball medicine.
- So we can fix time again.
But I hate my fur-ball medicine.
I don't care what it says on the label, it does not taste like bubble gum.
I won't take it and you can't make me.
Nah-ah-ah.
Unless you want a great nephew born in a van, named Moonbeam, grab him.
Ha-ha.
Your evil plan backfired.
I'm skinny enough to get through my cat door.
- You'll never catch me now.
- Oh, no, Salem.
- Now what do we do?
- Get a dog?
I didn't know how difficult the '60s were for women.
We've come a long way in 30 years.
You wanna talk about a tough time for women, try the 1560s.
You couldn't own your own hovel.
And you had to marry whatever bootblack or wheelwright your family picked for you.
You could spend all day sharpening his axe or cleaning his musket, but you weren't even allowed to kill your own dinner.
Can I come out now?
Not until we get back that time ball.
- Glad Salem came home.
- I knew he would.
He's not exactly cut out for the mean streets.
Plus, he missed a whole week of his stories.
Well, can I at least have a magazine?
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Would you like some more cocoa, Aunt Zelda?
Not until I know why you're doing all this.
I just want you guys to relax.
And I want my own car.
No.
- Then you leave me no choice.
Here.
- Ow.
A C in History?
- I got a C because I don't have a car.
- That happened to me once.
I got a D because my dad wouldn't get me a rocket.
I had a report due on the Freedom Trail.
I had to go to the stupid Freedom Trail but my ride to Boston fell through, so I ran out of time.
Sabrina, you cannot blame your circumstances for not getting your work done.
If there are obstacles in your path, go around them.
That's right.
If you can't get to the Freedom Trail, try a freedom fighter.
Paper on the Freedom Trail?
The Freedom Trail includes many historical sites of significance to Boston.
Wouldn't a car have been easier?
I'm all tapped out.
I'm coming.
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.
- Ready for breakfast?
- Yeah, we're going to Big John's.
If you order the lumberjack special before 8:30, you get to keep the plate.
If you get there before 8:15, you get the fork.
Think Big John's is going out of business?
We're going to the aquarium.
We'll be back by 6.
I'm driving.
Oh, no, I'm not.
I don't have a car.
- Nice try, Sabrina.
- Have fun.
- That's weird.
It's stuck.
- Are you sure?
What's going on?
I know it sounds crazy, but the door won't open.
I wonder how that happened?
Oh, dear.
Hilda, would you check the back door?
- Right.
- And I'll try these.
Boy, that's a-- Nope.
Hilda.
Any luck?
Even the cat door won't open.
Is it time to start worrying about the oxygen supply?
Will you excuse us for a second?
- What's going on here?
- I've got a hunch.
Hilda, did you mail that mortgage payment last week?
Of course I did.
Didn't I?
Oh, I absolutely-- Don't remember.
Well, we're probably in a lockdown.
It's a scare tactic witch lenders use to remind the customer their payment is a little late.
Or that their little sister is a little brain-dead.
We've got to go there.
How am I gonna stall Harvey and Valerie?
- You'll think of something.
- But don't use a mind freeze.
When people are thawed, they tend to lose the letter R. - Go around the obstacles, right?
- That's our girl.
Then can I have a car?
No.
Sorry, guys.
Our alarm system freaked out.
My aunts went upstairs to check on it, but we're locked in.
Let me try this thing.
Is this part of the standard alarm package, or is it extra?
We're not going to Big John's.
That's okay, I'll cook.
And everyone goes home with a knife.
Wait here.
Hello, ladies.
Welcome to Budget Mortgage, where we forgo the frills to save you money.
That's why I picked it.
Yes.
I'd give you my card, but that would be a frill.
Our house has been sealed.
Has it started to fill up with sand yet?
- No.
- Well, then it's not a foreclosure.
Probably just a late payment.
Let's have a look-see.
Mm Spellman, okay.
P, Q, R Coming up.
Freshly zapped orange juice.
Okay, now should I make omelettes or eggs Benedict?
Well, since I don't know what eggs Benedict is, I guess I'll make omelettes.
Sabrina.
- Pesky earthquakes.
- We're lonely.
- Yeah, can we hang with you?
- Please don't.
I mean, I can't have you stealing all my Spellman family recipes.
For eggs?
Come on, you won't even know we're here.
- Okay.
So how do you like them?
- Scrambled's fine with me.
Okay, then.
Is that scrambled on top of the stove or in some sort of casserole?
Seventeen.
One-seven.
Five-aught-five.
How do you like this baby, huh?
A lot better than a slide rule, I'll tell you.
Alrighty.
Well, your payments are up to date.
Then why is our house sealed?
I don't know.
I could run these numbers again-- No!
Or let me see if I can get the main auditor on the blower.
- I didn't know eggs were flammable.
- No, the potholder's flammable.
It spread to the eggs.
Ethel?
Ethel, it's Ed.
Would you please try plaza 209 for me?
No hurry.
We've got all century.
- Mm.
I'm full.
- Stuffed.
Think you could see how your aunts are doing with that alarm system?
Oh, alrighty.
You bet.
Mm-hm.
You too.
One more pleasantry, and Ethel will get hurt.
Yeah, I'll call you later.
Ahem.
What my sister means is, did you find anything out?
Well, your mortgage has indeed been fully paid.
You know what you are?
You are-- Not helpful.
Ugh.
We are taking our mortgage elsewhere.
Hilda, it's a 200-year loan at 1 percent.
I don't care.
Why is it raining pork rinds?
Your house is sealed, and somebody is dumping salty snacks?
You don't have a mortgage problem.
That's family.
We don't have any relatives that we have problems with.
- Boyd and Racine.
- Ah!
Our hillbilly cousins.
Told you.
Do you think it's possible that your aunts got lost upstairs?
I think I'm getting bedsores.
What was that?
Oh, they're probably off the phone.
I'll go check.
Meanwhile, why don't you guys go play pool?
- You have a pool table?
- Yeah.
- Right through there in the parlour.
- That's awesome.
Let's play.
- Wow, it looks brand-new.
- Why were we playing cards?
- Finally.
Can we leave now?
- Unfortunately, no.
Our cousins, Racine and Boyd, have put a lockdown on the house.
But the good news is, I did pay the mortgage.
- Racine and Boyd?
- They're relatives you haven't met yet, because they're horrible.
They're just horrible.
They're mad because Great-Granny left us the magic book in her will.
They tend to lash out if they have a bad night at bingo.
But they can still do magic-- I mean, they sealed this house pretty well.
Well, on Earth a little magic goes a long way, but in the Other Realm it's about as impressive as hanging a spoon from your nose.
Oh.
It must be hard for them to manage in the Other Realm without the magic book.
Why, it would be like an American teenager without a car.
I have to hand it to her.
Even in a panic situation, she managed to pitch that car.
We have to do something.
I have mortals in the parlour.
- We don't have a parlour.
- We do now.
Calm down.
These feuds don't last forever.
It'll probably be over in a year or two.
- What?
- We'll think of a solution over lunch.
We'll eat in.
- Who could that be?
- Probably Racine and Boyd.
I just invited them for lunch.
WOMAN : Lord have mercy.
Look at the number of towels.
MAN : Like there's one towel for each person.
- Ah.
Heh.
Whoo.
- Ooh.
It's a good thing you folks have such a fancy place because you ain't never leaving it.
- Hi, I'm Sabrina.
- We're sitting in our recliners in our own front yard, and suddenly we're conjured to the mortal realm.
What would you call that, Maw Maw?
Rude.
- You must be Racine.
- And that's Boyd, Racine's husband.
And Boyd's mother, Maw Maw.
That's her given name.
Sabrina wanted us to invite you over so that we could talk about this feud.
At lunch.
Didn't somebody say something about lunch?
Hey, I got dressed.
They better be feeding us.
Maw Maw.
The towel.
Well, so far, so good.
Well, look at what the magic book can do.
This place looks like the Taj Mahal with indoor plumbing.
Sorry, folks.
Graceland is closed today.
You know, cat make real nice jerky.
Okay, well, how about we start this visit off right?
I'll get everyone some iced tea, and you guys can unseal the house.
How about I take my iced tea with a little sugar and a magic book?
Oh, well, that's certainly in the spirit of compromise.
Can't you ever talk like a normal person?
This from a woman who says "cain't"?
I think we'll feel better once we eat something.
The dining room's that way.
- Oh, no TV trays?
- What is this, Christmas?
I don't care how many times you beat me, - I'm not calling you Westbridge Slim.
- Okay.
How about just Slim?
Is the alarm fixed yet?
- Not yet.
- We should call the fire department.
- They have axes.
- No.
What Sabrina means is-- No.
The alarm company's working on it.
Well, what about the police?
- Why don't you stay for lunch?
- What?
It'll be all right.
I'll warn-- Tell our guests.
- You have guests?
- Cousins.
How did they get in if we can't get out?
Oh, well, they got here last night.
They just woke up now.
Jet lag.
- Where are they from?
- Hong Kong.
- What is this?
- I don't know.
Something expensive, I reckon.
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Look at that.
Their own still.
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Don't touch that!
I'm sorry.
It's just very sensitive equipment.
Sure, sure.
Put us down for two jugs.
Listen, before we zap in lunch, I want you to know that Sabrina's mortal friends will be joining us.
Oh, Lord.
Don't tell Maw Maw.
Maw Maw don't break bread with no mortals.
- Well, Sabrina's half mortal.
- Oh, Lord.
Don't tell Maw Maw.
Well, we won't tell Maw Maw if you won't do magic at lunch.
Deal?
Are those fancy sort of rules one might find in, say, a magic book?
Right this way.
Here, just in case you need to divert Harvey and Valerie's attention.
"Astonish Mints"?
"One fact enthrals for hours".
You really think I'm gonna need these?
Bring on the grub!
Like I said, just in case.
My, that's quite an impressive hat, Boyd.
- I wish you wouldn't wear that.
- It is just a touch silly.
It'd be fine if we could afford brand-name soda.
But with bargain soda, he looks like a fool.
Grown man with cheap soda on his head.
What message does that send?
I'll tell you what message: "This man's got no magic book".
- Magic book?
- TV Guide.
Heh.
Hong Kongians.
Anybody mind if I zap in something fried?
You're talking about using a microwave, right?
I mean, there's nothing magical about that.
Baked potato in six minutes.
That's pretty magical.
So tell us what it's like living in Hong Kong.
What is your little mortal friend talking about?
Mortal?
I ain't sitting next to it.
- Mortal?
- Mint?
- Is it my breath?
- Yeah, Harvey, you too.
Anyone ever been astonished by the number nine?
Me.
Three times nine is 27, which is two and seven-- And two and seven equals nine.
That's astonishing.
I have a calculator up in my room?
Race you?
To think I mixed with mortals.
Now I can't be buried in the family crypt.
The problem you have with mortals is the same problem you have with my aunts.
What?
Mortals have the magic book?
No.
You feud with my aunts because you don't understand them.
And they have a magic book.
You have to see things from the other person's point of view.
I think I see both sides because I'm half mortal.
I knew it.
Those eyes are too far apart.
So since everything's reversed, when I look into a mirror, I'm not seeing what you see when you look at me.
Exactly.
You look nothing like that.
That's astonishing.
I want to work.
It's just hard when you ain't got no magic book.
Or a grammar book.
We'll get more pudding.
And crackers.
You seem to like that combination.
I know what you mean.
I want a car.
Oh, just like Boyd wants a job.
- Exactly.
But I don't have the money.
- Just like we don't have a magic book.
Right.
See, now we're understanding each other.
This is the beginning of working things out.
Well, I'm glad to see someone understands our troubles.
I do.
I know how tough it is to make it on your own.
I mean, my aunts told me I have to earn the car, but it's hard to get a job when you're 17.
Are you implying that Boyd shouldn't have trouble finding work?
No, I meant it's hard for me because I'm in school.
Oh, so now you're throwing your "ed-u-cation" up in our face.
I bet you think we're nothing but witch trash.
That's not what I meant.
I'm the one who sympathises with you.
- Really?
- Absolutely.
When I think of how much the book's helped me since I got it.
The mutt has the magic book.
Oh, Maw, the mortals are taking over the world.
Sabrina, you give us that magic book, and you give it now.
But I'm studying for my witch's licence.
Here we are.
Well.
I guess there's no more reason for us to stay.
The magic book has passed hands and once again, our hands are empty.
Come on, we're missing the Wheel.
Oh, don't go.
Look, there's more pudding.
We got pudding at home.
It may be canned.
It may be government surplus.
I don't know.
It may even be pie filling.
But it's ours.
Don't be a big baby, Boyd.
Unseal this house and let those mortals go home.
We wouldn't unseal this highfalutin house for all the bacon grease in China.
How am I gonna get Valerie and Harvey out of this house?
I say we fight pork rinds with garbage.
Let's start by pelting them with rotten tomatoes.
No, no, no.
These Spellmans will not stoop to their level no matter how tempting that might be.
We will not get anywhere by trying to get  even.
This means war.
Wheel of Fortune.
No!
Ah!
Are Harvey and Valerie okay?
Yeah, they're still astonished.
It's rather astonishing.
- Hey.
- Oh, no.
Those hayseeds are messing with gravity.
And yet they can't get a job?
Two can play with the elements.
It's tornado time.
Finally, we'll see if Racine's hair can move.
Stop.
This has gone too far.
I'll just give them back the magic book.
- I wish you wouldn't.
Great-Granny.
Do you mind if we get down from here?
I had a big lunch.
Thank you.
And the ceiling needs painting.
Great-Granny, this is our niece, Sabrina.
Oh, well, aren't you just a dear?
Why in creation are you looking at me like that?
I'm sorry.
It's just-- I thought you were dead.
Is my makeup too pale?
No.
You left us the magic book in your will.
Oh, Sabrina.
We witches live so long, that we go through several wills just to thin out all the things we tend to accumulate.
It's our version of a garage sale.
Couldn't we sit down?
It really was a large lunch.
I've heard your side of the story.
Now, I wonder what would be the right thing to do.
Oh, I know.
Hear the other side.
And make it snappy.
I foolishly wore a girdle.
It's all their fault.
They hog the magic book, then they bring us here to flaunt their riches.
- Oh, that's not true.
- Liar.
Did you seem them towels?
Everybody.
Stop your bellyaching.
And, Boyd, take off that ridiculous hat.
But, Granny-- Oh, Racine, I know you're unhappy but it was fair.
Now, Hilda and Zelda got the magic book, and you got what you chose: all my money.
They got all Great-Grandma's money?
Yep.
And they bought a mansion and a jet and several butlers-- Don't forget tiaras for Maw Maw.
And then all the money was gone.
We didn't just spend it.
We invested some of it.
Yeah.
Who knew Chihuahua racing wouldn't take off?
Uh-- Everyone?
And I suppose there was no money left over for a car, right?
Racine, Boyd, your trouble is not the magic book.
Stop blaming your circumstances.
You've got obstacles.
Go around them.
Yes, I heard her.
I still don't think it's fair.
And did you see all them towels that they got up in there?
All right.
The next person who interrupts me is going straight to the corner.
Yes, that's right.
Let Great-Grandmother talk.
Zelda, corner.
But I was just--  Ugh.
- Now, get along.
Help each other.
Oh, and, Racine, unseal this house.
Finally, I'm free.
I have no place to go.
I think I'll count the towels.
- I'm sorry about the aquarium.
- Oh, who cares?
We still got to look at that rug in your room.
Look, clouds.
Oooh Great-Granny, will you come back and visit now that you're not dead?
Well, you should come and visit me.
You'd love Florida.
Unless you burn like I do.
May I please be excused?
Not until you've thought about what I said.
I just wish I could remember what it was.
I'm not letting my grades suffer because I don't have a car.
- Oh, really?
- Yep.
Taking the bus to the aquarium.
Don't expect me before dark.
Fine.
Don't expect me to be in a good mood, because I hate the bus.
Try being on the back of a burro with the rest of your husband's possessions.
Hmm?
You haven't ridden the bus lately, have you?
- Any instructions, Aunt Zelda?
- Take a sweater.
Okay.
Gotta go.
Grandma.
No.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
It's not funny, Salem.
Morning.
Why did Salem startle me?
It's Friday the 13th, the day that black witch-cats have the power to scare the living daylights out of people.
You should've seen your face.
I gotta stop laughing or milk's gonna come out of my nose.
Here comes Hilda.
Act normal.
Good morning, Hilda.
Oh, happy Friday the 13th, Salem.
Aunt Hilda, a bat just flew out of your mouth.
Oh, how embarrassing.
I have bat breath again.
Have you been eating pomegranates?
I know they don't agree with me, but I had a craving for crimson pulp.
Is it bad?
Look, a tour group.
I have to update my wardrobe.
Great.
Can we get this quiz over with?
I have to get to school.
There's no quiz.
I just came by to tell you it's Friday the 13th.
I already told her.
I might not even take a nap today.
There's more to Friday the 13th than black cats with a sorry sense of humour.
To learn more, read about it.
Like I have time for this.
"Eleventh hour, 12th of never, What?
I can do that?
Why didn't you guys tell me that on Friday the 13th I can tell a mortal I'm a witch?
Oh.
The one where you can tell anyone and they can know for 24 hours?
- Yes.
- We didn't want you to know.
Well, I learned it on the streets.
- Who should I tell, Harvey or Valerie?
Oh, Sabrina.
Telling mortals is a very bad idea.
But I wanna come out of the linen closet.
We felt the same way when we were your age, but you think you know someone This is a secret that's hard for mortals to accept.
When I was younger, I was dating a doctor.
You've probably heard of him.
My little apple strudel.
Oh, Sigmund.
Are you ready for the opera, my dear?
Yes.
But first, there's something that I must tell you.
Ah.
Something about your childhood?
You hate your mother, don't you?
- No.
- Really?
I hate your mother.
Today is Friday the 13th, and there's something that I get to share with you.
Sigmund, my darling, I'm a witch.
Oh, well, you can be a little testy.
No, no.
I have real magical powers.
Uh-huh.
Can you show me these magical powers?
Well, you remember that pocket watch that you admired?
For you, Siggy.
Get out of here.
Witch.
Witch.
Take her out of here.
We can make it work.
This didn't happen.
It was bad knackwurst.
Ja, that's right.
Once I got loose, I tripped him.
You might say it was the first Freudian slip.
Guys overreact.
You should've told a girlfriend.
I did.
I told my good friend Gwendolyn.
We were out shopping, and everything was going well  This is some joy.
- Why didn't thou tell me sooner?
- Well.
Make yon man's breeches rip.
Gwendolyn was a lot of fun, but what a blabbermouth.
She told everyone she knew, and then some.
Forsooth, 'tis true.
Zelda's a witch.
They didn't take it very well.
She made the crops fail.
It's her.
And then things really got ugly.
ALL : Dunk the witch!
Dunk the witch!
To this day I don't care for swimming.
Yeah, but by midnight, mortals don't remember.
So even if they hate you, the next day it's over.
They don't remember, but you remember.
Think long and hard about this, Sabrina.
If you tell someone, you may never feel the same way about that person again.
Well, this was uplifting.
Thanks.
I'll think about it.
Just spooked a bread truck.
The street is full of buns.
- Hi, Libby.
- Ew.
Why doesn't she like me?
I'm thinking it's a thyroid problem.
- Why do you care?
- Because I'd love to be popular.
You know, to have everyone respect me.
- Bye, Libby.
- I just ate.
- Any plans for your free period?
- Just my usual doodlefest.
You think you can help me study for my Spanish test?
I have it after Study Hall, and if I don't get at least a B, I'm toast.
Sure.
- What?
- I will help you.
I could live with a C. Excuse me.
Somebody didn't eat their vegetables.
What are you doing?
You look ridiculous.
State law says I have to wear a hairnet.
Come on.
It's time for a test of your endurance.
We're off to Alaska for the Iditarod.
Oh, but what about Valerie?
Sabrina?
Sabrina?
Where did she go?
A nerd ditched by a freak.
It's like a movie of the week.
Now, say goodbye to bat breath.
Oh, I hope it works.
Oh, great.
Now I have bass breath.
Still think I'm on the right track.
You passed.
Now get to class.
Mush.
Oh, I missed Social Studies.
You had a substitute.
He spent the entire day trying to open his desk drawer.
But here's your homework.
Great.
I had an easy class, and I smell like blubber.
Valerie.
Valerie.
Valerie, I'm so sorry I took off like that.
I failed my Spanish test.
At least I think F means the same thing in both languages.
- I'm so incredibly sorry.
- I thought you were my friend.
- Just forget it.
- Valerie, wait.
There's something I need to tell you.
You're my best friend and I've been lying to you.
I wanted to tell you the biggest secret, and then maybe you'll understand why I've disappeared in the cafeteria and been acting strange pretty much all the time.
I'm a witch.
I knew you could be a little grumpy sometimes, but-- No.
I have magical powers.
Right.
Well, can you show me some magic?
You know that sweater you've always wanted?
Get out of here.
This is so cool.
Well, it's so cool that you think it's so cool.
And you have no desire whatsoever to have me committed?
No.
But I do have a few questions.
That whole pointed-hat, wart-on-the-nose thing?
Pure Hollywood.
You don't cook potions in a cauldron?
- Now that one we do.
- This is amazing.
So you just point at stuff, and stuff happens?
That's the technical definition of it.
- Well, can we point at stuff now?
- You bet.
Shh.
Isn't he that weird lunch lady?
Valerie, I'd like you to meet my quizmaster.
Isn't this great?
I can show her all my magic.
Well, not all your magic.
You need a ticket for each time you use magic with a mortal.
This one's for the sweater.
Why do I need tickets?
Mortals don't have a lot of restraint when it comes to magic or firearms.
Quiz you later.
Hey.
Pop out the way you popped in, with all that lightning-and-smoke stuff.
See what I mean?
I blame television.
It's pointing time.
I've discovered the cure.
Eureka.
It's all in this little tablet.
Just give it to me.
Testing, one, two, three.
Yes.
It worked.
- Thanks, sister.
- I'm not just your sister.
I'm a genius.
I can end hunger.
I can save the world.
Oh, for crying out loud, it's a breath mint.
Oh, no.
SeÃ±ora Martinez.
I'd almost forgotten about my F. Hola, Valerie.
That means "hello".
Hola.
SeÃ±ora Martinez?
Of course I'll give you a second exam.
You've obviously been studying.
I love magic.
There's Harvey.
You've gotta tell him about this.
No, no, wait.
Valerie.
Sabrina's a witch.
Valerie told me your secret.
Yeah.
It's true.
Not really.
Yeah.
Here.
Have some baseball cleats.
Whoa!
I'm a witch.
- Can we talk about this?
- Sure.
A witch?
So "freak" was an understatement.
So, what is this Other Realm?
Little place we call the witchy city.
Salem talks?
And I have a pretty good singing voice.
And he stops.
Okay.
We're off to the Other Realm.
Sabrina, you're walking into a closet.
After all you've seen today, this seems weird?
Come on.
It's still a closet.
Will you wait?
- Wow.
- So, what do we do here?
Same thing we do in the mortal realm: hang out.
Balloon.
Buy your mortal a balloon.
I'll take two.
I know.
I have tomato sauce on my tie.
So, what magic does the balloon do?
Nothing.
Sucker.
Carney workers.
Hey, I could use some sunglasses.
Wow.
These are awesome.
You should get some.
I have a whole drawer full of virtual-reality sunglasses.
Wow, that's amazing.
You can look dorky in this realm too.
Of course it's true.
I heard it with my own ears and have seen it with my own eyes.
Sabrina's a witch.
Okay, okay.
The next step is to decide how to use this piece of information.
How can this help me?
Thanks for the cure, Zeldy.
Now I can enjoy pomegranate pudding, pomegranate compote, pomegranate pie.
I like pomegranates.
This is what it's all about for me.
Enabling you to eat too much fruit.
A message from the Other Realm.
I hope it didn't ruin my pomegranate toast.
It's from Elixir Pharmaceuticals.
They heard about my discovery.
They want me to come do a demonstration with my subject.
Me.
Take me.
A whole other realm of people to scare?
Yeah, take him.
There's no way I'm going to humiliate myself in front of a bunch of eggheads.
Fine.
Then no more cure.
And that means no more pomegranates.
Egghead.
Okay.
We only have two tickets left.
So for the grand finale, you each get to make a last wish.
- I wanna meet Mark Langston.
- Who?
Mark Langston.
My favourite pitcher.
Four all-star games, and he can really bring the heat.
Well, I'm assuming since it's your last wish, that's a good thing.
I saw him the day he no-hit the Mariners.
Harvey.
- Hey, how's it going, man?
- Pretty good.
- How about warming me up?
- Sure.
Please don't let this be a dream.
Oh, this is great.
Mark Langston just broke all my fingers.
I know what I want.
Say Mark Langston, we could save a ticket.
No.
My guy's funny, he can really move and he's so cute.
The Dalai Lama can dance?
Drew Carey.
I wanna dance with Drew Carey.
Thanks for the dance, Valerie.
This is the best moment of my life.
Gee, I wish I had a rose to give you.
Oh, I know.
Here.
Have these.
Hope you're nearsighted.
Was it fun?
I'm never taking these off.
Man, he's blind.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
- And you saw it with your own eyes?
- That's right.
Your children are going to school with a proven witch.
- Oh, we've gotta get her out.
- Exactly.
But first things first.
I get anything good in her locker.
Now that the pomegranate has been administered, observe what happens when Subject A speaks.
Subject A has a name.
Now open your mouth wide, so that they can see the severity of your condition.
Oh, good.
I'm late.
Hey.
Let's take a look inside your mouths.
Did you see?
Mark Langston signed my bruise.
You're gonna have to describe it to me, because I can't see a - thing!
- Valerie!
- Aah!
- Harvey!
Oh, no.
Not a swirling vortex.
Take it easy.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Don't panic.
This is bad.
This is very bad.
Hey, help me.
My friends are swirling.
Why don't you just zap them out?
- I'm out of tickets.
I guess you lost your head.
My findings suggested that if I took two parts boric acid and combined it with the shells of dung beetles You said those were raisins.
What a snore.
I need a little fresh air and a latte.
Come see the mortals in a vortex.
Only two tickets.
Reach for my hand!
Why didn't I listen?
Harvey and Valerie are gonna be sucked into oblivion, and if they come out alive, they're gonna think I'm a monster.
Come on, oblivion.
- You've got tickets.
Give me tickets.
No.
They're mine.
- Come on, you headless goon.
Yo, Sabrina.
- I just had 20 lattes.
Black cat.
Stop the vortex.
Are you guys okay?
I'm fine!
Yeah, yeah, thanks for the tickets.
You guys hate me?
No.
And I'm beginning to understand why Scotsmen wear kilts.
Nice and breezy.
We've gotta get a picture of this.
Do one nice thing today?
Oh, all right.
But I have to warn you, I tend to cut people's heads off.
Oh, I forgot.
Here's your sleeve.
Wow, you guys were near death and you still managed to save my sleeve.
- Near death?
- Anyway, thanks for everything.
Being a witch is so much more fun when you can tell your friends.
You're so lucky.
The only secret I have is that I'm allergic to watermelon.
Well, that's out.
There's the witch.
Is it true you have magical powers?
Don't ask her.
She won't admit to anything.
Ask them.
They'll corroborate my story.
What's this all about?
Come on, Harvey.
I've got a book deal in the works and a piece of it could be yours.
Libby, are you having another episode?
Forget him.
He's been under her spell since she first flew in.
- Tell them, Valerie.
- No.
You know it's the truth.
If you back me up on this, I won't forget about it.
None of the popular girls will.
I hate to do this, but I have no idea what you're talking about.
You freaks are so infuriating.
Looks like another high-school prank.
She is a witch.
And an extraterrestrial.
Look, do an alien autopsy.
You guys.
Wow, it's after midnight.
My parents are gonna wonder where I've been.
Where have I been?
Just hanging out.
Oh, man.
My hand is throbbing.
I've got a little motion sickness.
Did we break any laws?
Not really.
See you.
What are you hiding?
Sneaky.
What is it?
Nothing.
It's just a package of Bat-breath Savers.
How could you?
Look at my hair.
Well, at least you can eat all the pomegranates you want.
I'm sick of pomegranates.
Hey, you still up?
Yeah.
So how was your day?
Well, I told Valerie, and Valerie told Harvey that I'm a witch.
Oh, how did it go?
Honey, are you okay?
You were right.
I'll never feel the same way about Valerie or Harvey again.
- Really?
- Yeah.
I like them so much more.
How come you have better friends than we did?
So no matter how many people Libby told, they've all forgotten by now.
- That's the way it works.
- Good.
I wanted to make sure I wasn't gonna be burned at the stake Monday.
Oh, he had some Friday the 13th.
Poor little guy wore himself out.
Oh, he looks so peaceful.
Should we?
That's okay.
I have another eight lives.
Seven after I fall down from here.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
VILA : So you grab a chain and whack away.
- After you.
- I feel weird.
I haven't even had an argument with this cabinet.
Hold me back.
It's got a good beat and I can dance to it.
- I give it a 92.
What are you doing?
It sounds like you're smashing furniture.
Oh.
You are smashing furniture.
Why?
It's our new hobby.
We're antiquing this cabinet.
Some people wait a hundred years.
We're just beating the tar out of it.
Personally, I find knitting relaxing.
It's a great way to get out your frustration.
Take that, stupid Nobel Prize committee.
May I?
Take that, people who won't buy their dear niece a car.
Oh, shoot, I missed what Bob did with the linseed oil.
Well, let's ask him.
- Could you go over step four again?
- How did I get?
Whoa, this needs a lot of work.
Say, Bob, you ever wired a litter box for cable?
I gotta remember to crack a window when I work with varnish.
I'm ready for my close-up.
Do I have food in my teeth?
- Salem.
What?
What?
- It was like this when I found it.
- Val and I are going to the movies.
If I'm not dressed in five minutes, I'm gonna miss my ride.
Why didn't you say so?
I don't mind moving.
Even if I knew what I wanted to wear, I couldn't pick it out of this mess.
- It's full of kibble crumbs.
Brush them in a pile.
I'll eat them later.
Better clean this up.
I forgot, I'm only allowed incantations this week.
Thank you, quizmaster.
Uh Stuff is messy This place is a zoo Make things that need it Brand-spanking new Let's see if it worked.
Excellent.
"Extra charge for cat-hair removal"?
I think this is the nicest thing we ever beat up.
Except for that teamster.
Oh, no.
Our antique is brand-new again.
- That's odd.
- Meeting Valerie, Rialto Cinema.
- See you.
- Freeze.
- What?
Oh, yeah.
Back by 10.
- Cast any spells lately?
Yeah, I cast a make-everything-new spell.
- Why?
- You made it too general.
Look.
I guess now would be the wrong time to say I think it looks better like that.
- Sorry.
I was in a hurry.
- We witches have a saying: Haste makes a gigantic mess.
Got it.
Did I screw anything else up?
I found the Fountain of Youth.
It's the toilet.
No problem.
I'll just fix it with an undo spell.
I made things new And that was bad So undo it all So they won't be mad  Welcome back, trick knee.
Sabrina, you don't wanna rely on undo spells.
It's not in the spirit of magic.
You really have to get it exactly right the first time.
Otherwise, there may be side effects.
I remember one time, I was making rum balls and I got tired, so I made a make-everything-round spell.
Well, let's just say you can thank me for Columbus Day.
I'll be careful.
I don't have time to think of a spell to get rid of these wrinkles.
Help.
We think that outfit will serve as a helpful reminder.
I like her best.
- Hey.
- Hey, how can you stand it?
- The school is freezing.
- Oh, yeah.
Guess I'm too miserable to be miserable.
My Uncle Lloyd's coming to the football game on Friday.
Family members coming to cheer you on.
- It sounds terrible.
- It is terrible.
I can just hear my dad now: "Lloyd's three boys are first-string".
I never get to play.
Sure you do, that time we were up by 53.
Just once I'd like to start and shut Uncle Lloyd up.
And his two sons who can form sentences.
Well, maybe this Friday You'll start the game And Uncle Lloyd Will leave in shame Why are you talking in rhyme?
Kinkle, you're starting on Friday.
- I am?
- You are?
Well, look at that.
I love this carpet.
Yeah, this old thing is gonna go perfectly with the new stuff we made look old.
Hey, Val, look.
The Slicery's under new management.
Wow, that's the first time this month.
And they're looking for people to work after school.
- We should get jobs.
- You think?
Yeah, maybe we could save enough money to buy a car.
Or maybe our parents will get so sick of driving us to work that they'll buy us cars.
- It's win-win.
- All right, I'm in.
But I gotta warn you, I haven't had much luck with jobs.
When I was a camp counsellor, they fired me after two days.
They didn't give you a chance.
- They didn't even get to know you.
- Yeah.
And they eventually found those kids.
Hey.
Whoa, didn't mean to make you explode.
I think this cold weather's giving me the flu.
I told you to bundle up for math.
Coach finally gives me a chance to start, and now this.
I can hear my dad now, "Your nose runs faster than you do".
See you.
Poor Harvey.
Feel better.
And you will.
No spells at school unless I gotta And I do, so make it hotter Well, that concludes your orientation to the Slicery.
I'm Mrs. Popowski.
If you have any problems, my office is always open.
It's between the fryer and the wall.
Mrs. Popowski, there's a mistake on my nametag.
- My name is Sabrina, not Salinas.
- Live with it.
Yeah, and my name is Valerie, not Fred.
When I said "problems," I meant things like: "My hand is caught in the meatball maker".
Okay, Val, I'll do the dough and the sauce, - and you do the toppings.
- Check.
Slicery.
Okay, that's a large pizza, extra anchovies.
Hold the crust.
Hold the sauce.
Hold the cheese.
Salem, quit fooling around.
Crank call.
Okay.
Medium cheese.
- Medium cheese.
Check.
- Crust.
Sauce.
Cheese.
Oven.
- Check.
- We're a well-oiled machine.
- Okay.
Large pepperoni.
- Large pepperoni.
Check.
Crust.
Sauce.
Pepperoni.
Cheese.
Oh, no.
That was supposed to be cheese, pepperoni.
Okay, large, extra cheese, half mushroom.
Crust.
Sauce.
Things are gonna start hopping.
Weight Watchers meeting just let out.
I'll help.
Think that'll melt down?
- There.
Perfect.
- I don't believe it.
You've taken a beautiful rug and put it in the worst place ever.
Well, where would you put it?
- There.
Perfect.
- Yes, I see.
That is perfect, if we had our eyes gouged out.
I need a medium, half sausage, half pepperoni, quarter mushroom, quarter anchovy, extra cheese.
Val, could you get that?
Valerie?
Val, we have to get these pizzas finished now.
- Am I moving?
- No.
How about now?
- Somebody's gonna get fired.
- Oh, gosh.
This is faster than it happened at camp.
I can't tell the future That would make me omniscient But something bad's gonna happen Unless Val's more efficient Okay, that's medium, half sausage, half pepperoni, quarter mushroom, quarter anchovy, extra cheese.
Check.
Okay, the inert gases are neon, argon, krypton, leon?
Leon?
Boy, public schools have really gone downhill.
Hi, how you been?
I've been fine.
Let's get this quiz over with.
The fine art of conversation lives.
It's an easy one.
- Just clean up your room.
- It is clean.
Fine.
Here's a quiz I know I'll ace Put everything back In its rightful place Hey, that's my diary.
And I was just getting to the awkward teenage years.
Well, that was so easy, I almost feel guilty taking an A. Well, then this will make you feel a lot better.
- You failed.
- What?
You were only to clean your room, and you "put things back" where they belong.
That was a very sloppy spell.
With good results.
The room's clean and I busted Salem.
Listen to the man.
It was a sloppy spell.
Clean up your spells.
I still say it was a fine incantation.
Now, talk me through this kissing game, Seven Minutes in Heaven?
Wow, it's hot in here.
The boiler must be broken.
- What are you doing in my locker?
- Sweating.
Somebody left a heat spell running.
- Uh-oh.
That'd be me.
- I told you to be more precise.
No problem.
I'll fix it with an undo.
Let's see: It's hot in here It's making us perspire Undo the spell Or the straits will be dire.
Aah!
What's going on?
I've taken away your undoing privileges, partly to teach you a valuable lesson, partly fun for me.
How about this for fun?
Auditioning for Stomp.
So you can see by these projections, Mrs. Quick, we can easily put out two editions of the paper each week rather than one, and we can do it for 38 percent less money.
Good work, Val.
That's an excellent use of your resources.
- Check.
- Not that we need two papers a week.
You see that?
The efficiency spell I put on Val is working out great.
Oh, it looks good now, and that heat spell looked good too, yesterday.
Ow.
Ow.
- Harvey, what's the matter?
- I just burned my hand on my locker.
Oh, great, I have enough trouble catching with two good hands.
Now, how do you expect me to fix all this without an undo spell?
That's the part that's fun for me.
Think, Sabrina, think.
Okay, first let's take care of the temperature.
It's hot in here The sweat's a-pooling So let's get down To some serious cooling Cool.
Okay, now Harvey.
I got it.
The team doesn't need A Harvey that's tame So make him worthy Of the hall of fame See?
All done and no undo.
Oh, yes, but there was a hot front, which is now meeting a cold front, resulting in an occluded front.
- Oh, no.
That means-- - Yep.
Showers.
Everyone outside, where it's not raining.
I meant to do that.
And that too.
Come on.
Admit it.
That rug would look better in my room.
Please, that rug is an object of taste and refinement.
Your room is decorated with stuff a clown takes out of his pockets at night.
It's gone.
You've put it in your room, haven't you?
I most certainly did not.
Well, it's gotta be around here somewhere, then.
Psst, psst.
Tell you what happened to it for a belly rub.
Hi.
Gotta go to work.
Forgot my nametag.
The ulprit-cay just walked into the oyer-fay.
- What?
- Sabrina did it with an everything-in-its-place spell.
They threatened me.
- What did I do?
- Made our rug disappear.
Sabrina, normally I don't advocate undo spells, but I want that rug back.
I'd love to undo it, but: - If you can undo this, I can undo that.
- We can't undo that.
There's no undoing a no-can-undo.
It's a triple negative.
It's magically ungrammatical.
Sorry.
I gotta get to work.
We're introducing garlic sticks.
Now how are we gonna get our rug back?
Excuse me.
There's someone whose belly earned a rubbing.
Oh, I know.
Everyone inside is beginning to bug Help them find their stupid lost rug Close enough.
Come on, you can't vanish and rub at the same time?
- Where are we?
- I don't know.
But I bet I know who's to blame.
- Sabrina.
- Sabrina.
Oh, I'm sure she heard that.
- Salem, that's not helping.
- Hey, there's your rug.
That is our rug.
- That was helping.
You know, this place reminds me of Merlin's old weekend castle.
Oh, man.
You guys had a vicious breakup.
That was awful.
By the time it was over, the only thing I liked about him was-- --this rug.
This is Merlin's castle.
We better get out of here.
Yeah.
For a guy who wears a dress, he's a real misogynist.
Leaving?
So soon?
- Hi, Merl.
- Zelda Spellman.
I haven't seen you in 500 years.
So, what you been up to?
Oh, a little bit of this, a little bit of that.
And you?
Uh Waiting for revenge.
- Why don't you stay a while?
- How long a while?
Until you love me again.
How about if I love you?
Or me?
I can be quite tender.
I feel like we've made a hundred pizzas today.
Seventy-four.
Seventy-five.
- Check.
- Fred.
Sabrina, this is hard for me.
I'm your friend, - but also your supervisor.
- When did you become supervisor?
- Just now.
- Way to go.
I've already celebrated.
Who arranged these pepperonis?
The pepperoni fairy.
Back when I was on the line, I liked to remember the three P's: precision, placement, promptness.
- You forgot "pannoying".
- You're on your ten-minute break.
Go.
- Spellman.
- Sorry, I must have dozed off.
And you extended your break by 55 seconds.
I'll make it up at the end of the day.
I'll run into the walk-in cooler.
That would be fine if you were still part of the Slicery, but you're fired.
Look at that.
I gave myself two minutes to dismiss you, and it only took one.
Check-a-roonie.
The garlic sticks bite.
- We need a plan.
- How about we weep uncontrollably?
If only we could get a message to Sabrina, she could reverse her spell.
But we can't, so we have to work on Merlin.
Now, one thing I remember about him is he doesn't like to be challenged.
That's right.
You once questioned a word he used in Scrabble, and he turned you into an oryx, which, as I recall, was also the word.
Exactly.
Maybe if we're nice to Merlin, he'll feel sorry for us and let us go.
- So let's not antagonise him.
- Good plan.
- Dead magician walking.
- How is everyone?
- Got everything you need?
No, no, we're fine.
Now that I think about it, I could use a little freedom.
So have you decided to love me again?
I'd rather lick a dead seal.
Am I the only one who remembers the plan?
- Excuse me-- - Oh, shut up, conehead.
It can't be done.
It's a shame you've decided now to be so nasty, just when I was about to feed you.
- You're not gonna feed us?
- That's right.
And they look mighty hungry, so I'd sleep with one eye open, cat.
You're not gonna be able to keep us here forever.
My niece, Sabrina's, gonna find out we're missing, and she's gonna come after us with a lot of help.
And drunken bouncers.
Oh, I'm so scared.
Maybe I ought to send you back.
Wait a minute.
I think I got a better idea.
You're never gonna believe what happened.
My friend-- I mean soon-to-be ex-friend, Val.
--fired me.
And I know what you're gonna say: "Sloppy spells, more specific:" So please don't.
I'm pooped.
I'm going to bed.
Thanks for listening, guys.
Guess I won't be needing this anymore.
Yes, that was a better idea.
You can always count on a teenager to be self-absorbed.
Attica!
Attica!
Attica!
Please, I'm trying to concentrate on a new escape plan.
Well, why don't you try coming up with some decorating ideas for this cell, because we're never leaving?
I've got it, the perfect escape plan.
It's so simple.
I can't believe I haven't thought of it before.
- What is it?
- You marry Merlin.
What do you think about painting these bars Navajo White?
Come on, Sabrina.
No time for breakfast.
I'm late and I have to try to fix Val.
I can't believe I put a spell on her.
I'm such a dummy.
Sabrina's never gonna save us.
There's no hope.
None.
And the worst part is, we're not gonna die.
We're gonna live here forever without hope.
No hope.
Uh-oh.
I bet I had something to do with this.
- Hot news coming through.
- Hey, Val, got a sec?
No, I have to get out the next edition of the paper.
By typing continuously, I can make it a daily.
You look like you haven't slept.
If I sleep, I won't have time to learn opera.
- Can we talk?
- Friendship is inefficient use of time.
Excuse me.
Pardon me.
Coming through, sorry.
Harvey?
I think I might have overdone it with the pull-ups.
I can take care of this.
Somehow.
- Blizzard!
- Oh, no.
Think fast.
Block that snow from pouring out And stick something in That spewing spout Help, quizmaster.
Are you sure you need help?
I mean, like you said, there's nothing wrong with inexact spells as long as they get the job done.
I got it wrong, very wrong.
It was all wrong.
It was a correctness shutout.
By the way, did I say I was wrong?
Because she admitted She'd been wrong and a lout Every spell she incanted Will be undone Including several ones She doesn't even know about They just have to be exact, not pretty.
- You wanna shut him up?
- Let's do it together.
Who's going to share--?
Cool.
So all I had to do was admit I was wrong?
And?
And that I have to be more careful with my magic?
And?
And I can learn something from my elders?
And?
And that the barn door on your ski suit is open?
See you.
You'll never believe the day I had.
I've learned so much.
I'll never do an inexact spell again.
In fact, I'm gonna go upstairs and clean my room the old-fashioned way.
We've gotta send something to the quizmaster for undoing Sabrina's spell and saving us.
He strikes me as a cheese-log person.
I am forever grateful.
I don't think I've ever been in a more terrifying situation.
And yet, I remembered to grab the rug.
And I learned a valuable lesson.
Whenever there's a crisis, I can depend on you guys to turn on me.
Come on.
We're sorry.
How about that belly rub?
I'm so cheap.
Lovely.
So how'd it go at the Slicery this weekend?
Terrible.
I fell apart and overcooked some pizzas.
Once the fire department was gone and Mrs. Popowski came to, she asked me to leave.
- How'd you get fired?
- Well, it's a long story.
Hey, Harvey, you really bulked down over the weekend.
- So how'd the game go?
- Great.
I caught a pass.
And if it had been inbounds, it would've been great.
Did anyone bring an umbrella?
I hear it's supposed to rain.
Not indoors.
They fixed the roof.
Let's never talk about it again.
You skipped your breakfast again, didn't you?
Yeah.
I'll catch up with you guys in a minute.
I'm gonna put my books away.
Hey.
Quizmaster, what are you still doing in there?
My apartment's being painted.
I needed a place to crash.
Well, just don't get cheese log all over my books.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
I love this time of year.
Christmas carols, sleigh rides, gigantic electric bills.
Sabrina, want to give us a hand?
In a sec.
I'm revising my Christmas wish list.
This year I'm hoping for a computer, a mountain bike Oh, and this great ski jacket I saw at the mall.
You're not exactly the Little Match Girl, are you?
Those sound pretty expensive, Sabrina.
I know.
That's why I prepared a list of backup gift ideas in a variety of price ranges.
Gotta go.
Oh, and you'll note on the bottom, I've listed the times I won't be around, so you can wrap my presents.
Don't worry.
I went through that "give me" phase.
It'll pass.
You're right.
Hey.
Give me that wise man.
Well, guess we're almost finished decorating, except for the tree.
You know, it's lovely.
But Christmas is a mortal holiday.
Shouldn't we do the tree the mortal way?
- Okay.
I'll conjure up a plastic one.
- Oh, no.
I meant, shouldn't we go and buy a tree and decorate it by hand?
All right.
- Where do they sell trees?
- The forest?
Too much rouge?
So I can't decide whether I shoot for A, the computer and the mountain bike, B, the computer and the ski jacket, or C, all of the above.
I'd hate to be there if you got a savings bond.
Hey, you wanna go to the mall with me and do some important Christmas present research?
Can't.
Gotta work.
Got a job at Hilmann's as a Santa Claus.
Is that just for the holiday season?
It's an okay job.
What bothers me is when the little kids go home thinking they're gonna get everything they asked for.
A lot of them are gonna be disappointed.
Aw.
Poor kids.
So should I ask for a helmet with the mountain bike, or do you think that's just implied?
The Army was defeated at Brandywine  Should I get the mountain bike or the jacket?
Definitely the mountain bike.
George Washington relocated to Valley Forge.
Mountain bike, George Washington - Sabrina.
Sabrina?
Sabrina.
We're talking about a very bloody war.
Why are you smiling?
Because I've been desensitized by popular culture?
Oh, I see.
First you kill the tree, and then you humiliate it.
Doing mortal things the mortal way just feels right.
My thumbs are numb.
You know, I was thinking, when we finish with the tree, that we could roast some chestnuts the mortal way.
Oh, good grief.
What's next?
Driving to the store?
- Hey, what did you get?
- Let's see, meat glop, fruit glop, vegetable glop and glop glop.
- Yum.
Save me a seat?
- Always.
Now, what sounds edible?
A baked potato.
Excellent.
Where did you get that?
Um, I ordered the kosher meal.
- Want a bite?
- No, thanks.
It smells like vodka.
For the last time, when I push, you pull.
Got it?
- Could you be less technical?
Oh!
Keep trimming that tree, and you'll be able to use it in your car as an air freshener.
- Hi, Harvey.
- Hey, Libby.
- Got any plans for the holidays?
- Like it matters.
I hate Christmas.
What's your take on Kwanza?
Usually like all the presents, but this year I have to be around my bratty stepbrother, Russell.
Really?
Your family has a brat in it?
He colours with my lipsticks, drips chocolate on my stuff, and he can cry on cue.
What's your problem, freak?
Hoping Santa will give you a personality this year?
And a crossbow!
Push, push.
Push!
Push!
I knew those Lamaze classes would pay off.
There.
- We have the makings - of a beautiful fire hazard.
- What do you think?
That's what a mortal tree looks like?
No wonder they drink during the holidays.
I'm gonna conjure some more asparagus.
Want some?
No, thanks.
You put too much ketchup on yours.
Hey, somebody took a bite out of it.
I did.
You didn't conjure your own asparagus, you took mine.
You think there's something wrong with my magic?
Conjure something else, we'll see.
I could use some protein.
How about a wharf rat?
How about a blouse?
There.
I'm fine.
And I have good taste.
Zelda, how was the lecture?
For a six-part dissertation on the reproductive cycle of garden snails, it was awfully dry.
And, boy, it is really getting cold outside.
Here's a tip, try wearing clothes.
Hey!
What happened to my blouse?
It was my favourite-- --Green silk one?
Sabrina, how many times do I have to tell you to ask before you borrow my clothes?
Especially when I'm already wearing them.
Something's wrong with me, Aunt Zelda.
I conjured asparagus, I got Aunt Hilda's.
I tried to conjure a blouse, I got yours.
Whatever you do, don't conjure anything fur.
What do you think it is, Zeldy?
Well, from what I know, the problem may be psychological.
Now, there's nothing to be afraid of.
Dr. Bull is one of the most highly regarded witch psychiatrists around.
She's got two doctorates from Other Realm universities and one from Utah State.
And tell me again why I had to sign that lobotomy release form?
And that about wraps it up.
Can I go now?
Conjures things from others, narcissism.
Based on these symptoms, one would conclude that you're suffering from egotitis.
Me?
I'm not the one with the wall full of diplomas.
Attacks when provoked.
It's a textbook case.
You're behaving like a little girl.
Am not!
What say we have a chat with your inner child?
Hey, I recognise you.
You're always encouraging me to run with scissors.
Tell me, inner child, what do you like most about Christmas?
All the presents.
Do you enjoy being with other people at Christmas?
If they bring me presents.
Thank you.
That will be all.
INNER  Where's my presents?
Sorry.
I didn't know my inner child would be so childish.
Or sticky.
I see what's happening here.
You're trying to recapture the excitement of Christmas you felt as a child.
So you're acting like a child.
Or, medically speaking, a spoiled brat.
So do I need a shot, or can I get away with an inhaler?
It's not that easy.
The cure for this malady must come from within.
You've got to rediscover the magic of Christmas.
And when you do, your egotitis will go away.
- That's it?
- Except for this.
Hundred and twenty dollars, please.
Feeling a little more in the spirit, dear?
I'm trying, but I just don't feel very Christmassy.
Maybe some music would help.
Put on a Johnny Mathis Christmas album.
Whatever.
I'll try anything.
I swear my Christmas album was here a minute ago.
Come on, John.
Get ahold of yourself.
Oh, is he the dreamiest or what?
And his voice is good too.
Wait a second.
"Property of J. Mathis".
Sabrina, you didn't conjure up a CD.
You just took one from Johnny Mathis.
Oh, man, don't tell me my egotitis still hasn't gone away.
Hey, maybe if I open some presents, I'll feel better.
Oh, no, I shook that one last night.
It was good.
Sabrina, when you have egotitis, you can't get any presents.
Receiving gifts only makes it worse.
This better be gone by my birthday.
What's the point of Christmas without presents?
Ever notice that building with the steeple and the bells?
So there's gotta be something you guys can do.
Well, there is someone who could help.
And we didn't call him before because?
He's a very big hoo-hah in the Other Realm.
- Who is he?
- Bob.
So his parents didn't know he'd be important when they named him.
Let's summon him with the Bob song.
ZELDA : Hm.
BOTH : Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob How do you remember the lyrics?
- Hey.
What's up?
- Oh, hello, Bob.
We have a problem.
Our niece Sabrina has a case of egotitis.
Yeah, that's not your only problem.
- It isn't?
- No, you've got one sorry-looking Christmas tree.
It looked better with presents.
Ohh.
Trying to recapture the spirit of Christmas, huh?
- Mm.
Can you help?
- I'll give it a shot.
I know.
Say, why don't you and I take a little trip to Christmas past?
No, it's been done.
Trust me, the trip to the graveyard is quite depressing.
Why don't you and I try to go and recapture your childhood Christmas memories?
And maybe have a look at the new Chryslers.
You have met this guy before, right?
Ow!
- Why'd you hit me?
- "Ow"?
Oh, Russell?
- What'd you do?
- What'd you hit him for?
- It's not my fault.
What are you doing?
Merry Christmas.
Cold, fun, snow, Libby in trouble.
Bob, I'm beginning to feel a lot like Christmas.
Well, see, I told you, it was only a matter of-- Oh!
Oh, no.
Are you okay?
Oh, no.
I slipped on some ice.
And I don't remember my ankle being the size of a grapefruit.
Don't worry, I'll get you a cane.
- Oh, thanks.
My cane!
- What happened to my cane?
- Oh, just my luck.
Don't tell me I still have egotitis.
Let's see, I'm hurt, grandpa's down, you're still worried about getting presents.
Oh, smart money would be on "yes".
VoilÃ !
You know, I've got to admit it.
I'm really proud of us.
We did it all by ourselves, just like a mortal family.
Do you want to zap it, or should I?
I will.
Little gaudy, don't you think?
Help!
Hurt Bob in the kitchen!
You take it easy.
We'll get you an ice pack.
- Everything is going to be fine.
- Absolutely.
Do you realise what you've done?
- What, Bob's gonna sue?
- No.
He's Santa Claus.
- What?
That's right.
You've just maimed Father Christmas.
So I guess I'm not the only one not getting presents this year.
So if you're Santa, how come you're not chubby?
Oh, combination of cardiovascular exercise and a little weight-training.
Could be that tapeworm.
Anyway, I've got a lot of deliveries to make.
Ha-ha.
Ho, ho, ho-- Ohh!
Oh!
You are not going anywhere.
Isn't there someone that could fill in?
Like a temp service or a cousin?
Well, there's always Mrs. Claus, but I can't call her.
She works for UPS.
This time of year, they're real crazy.
Well, Hilda and I can't help.
We have to stay and take care of you.
There must be somebody.
Me?
But Bob and I were this close to curing my egotitis.
A few more hours, I'll be back to normal.
Couldn't we just order everyone something from a catalogue?
Okay, I've got it.
Head due north and look for reindeer.
But don't take the first "Santa's Workshop" exit.
Take the second.
Okay.
This is a girl who has trouble getting to school on time, and she's supposed to deliver millions of presents by tomorrow morning?
Am I the only one who sees a problem?
You know, Salem, that's an excellent point.
"That's an excellent point.
That's an excellent point".
That is the last time I point out the flaw in someone's logic.
Mayday!
Mayday!
Intruder on the premises!
- Who are you?
- Sabrina.
Don't panic.
Santa's had a little accident.
No.
It's okay.
I'm gonna fill in for him.
No, I promise it'll be fine.
Who are you?
We're Santa's elves.
Well, I thought Santa's elves were small.
You're probably thinking of Fritz.
Whenever somebody whips out a camera, guess who always happens to be next to Santa.
What are you building?
- A CD player.
- Seriously?
Man.
You guys are good.
Yeah, perhaps you didn't know this, but we're on a deadline!
- How about wrapping?
All right.
- Gotcha.
How about a palm-sized digital camera?
Not for me, but a friend who's fallen on hard times.
We'll call him Salem.
- Ohh.
Oh, boy.
- Is there anything else, Bob?
I don't want to be an imposition, please.
Oh, Bob, you could never be an imposition.
Well, if you insist.
How about a couple burgers, chocolate malted and some chips?
Hey, either of you gals up for a game of Mouse Trap?
What's that gonna be?
A Ferrari, if someone would stop breathing down my neck.
I will if I can have a pipe cleaner.
Mayday!
Mayday!
Mayday!
- Fritz is wound a little tight.
- The naughty/nice list is missing.
Okay.
It's almost midnight, the list is missing, I keep running into Fritz under the mistletoe.
Calm down.
Okay, everyone retrace your steps.
That would put me under the mistletoe.
Mayday!
Mayday!
Mayday!
That guy's beginning to get on my nerves.
I found the list!
The reindeer ate it.
The reindeer ate it.
What are you gonna do?
- Me?
- You're in charge.
Do you know how many palms I had to grease to get on that nice list?
And nobody made a copy?
Oh, there is a copy of the list on that thing, but none of us know how to use it.
Oh, I bet I can.
You know, it only takes a minute to learn how to use these things.
Santa won't let us touch it.
Not since somebody got addicted to solitaire.
Hilda, wait!
I've got a few more things for you to pick up.
Two gallons of ice cream, four lemon meringue pies, a box of frozen onion rings and a case of Birch Beer.
Nobody makes a list like Santa.
Let's go!
Let's go!
It's almost Christmas in Tokyo.
Okay, okay.
here's your itinerary.
We had AAA make you a TripTik.
- Mayday!
Mayday!
Mayday!
- I swear, one of these days He does overreact.
The reindeer are sick!
The reindeer are sick!
He may have a point.
It must have been the list they ate.
What are we gonna do?
Think Zelda will let us borrow the station waggon?
There's no time.
These children need presents.
Okay.
We've all had our little laugh.
Now, take the nose off.
Ready to rock?
Is there still something on my head?
- Good luck!
- Godspeed.
They're never gonna make it.
You-know-who is ready for his pedicure.
- Your turn.
Zelda!
I'd like the black-cherry nail polish!
It is not my turn.
I clipped his ear hair.
I clipped his ear hair.
How fast does that stuff grow?
Well, that does it for the Baltic States.
- Want another pierogi?
- No, thanks.
I've already had moussaka, baklava and pad thai.
What was I thinking?
Buck up.
I see downtown Westbridge ahead.
Hey, there's Libby's house.
Great.
I can yak in her stocking.
No, I got her the perfect present.
Merry Christmas, Libby.
- What?
- Here, Libby.
Merry Christmas.
Oh, Russell.
It's a little jewellery box.
I made it myself.
Hey.
You wanna split the roof of my gingerbread house?
So you gave her love for her stepbrother?
It seemed like the right thing to do.
I would have given her the lump of coal, but then I'm not the one wearing the red hat.
ZELDA : She'll be coming around the mountain When she comes She'll be coming Around the mountain She'll be coming around The mountain She'll be coming around The mountain when she comes - Yee-haw!
- Yee-haw!
Encore!
Encore!
Oh, but wait now.
How about some more food first?
Perhaps a bit more coq au vin?
Bob, don't you think you should maybe be watching the calories?
No.
It's just water weight.
Band-Aids, cotton balls, aspirin?
What good is a first-aid kit without a stomach pump?
- Look.
Harvey's house.
- I can't look down.
What did you get him for Christmas?
A little miracle.
Merry Christmas, Harvey.
I couldn't sleep at all last night.
Kept thinking about that line, "He sees you when you're sleeping".
- Merry Christmas.
Must eat grass.
Merry Christmas.
How was it?
You're looking at a changed woman.
I don't even care if I get any presents today.
Look.
Your egotitis is gone.
I bet there's someone that could use this more than me.
Well, congratulations, Sabrina.
You've discovered how to re-create the childhood magic of Christmas, by making Christmas magic for others.
Hey, I could have used that suit.
It was freezing out there.
Well, now that you're cured, I can go home.
But your ankle, doesn't it hurt?
- No.
I was faking the whole thing.
- You were?
- Yeah.
- To teach me a lesson, right?
Well, there's that.
Plus I could use a break from, "Mayday!
Mayday!
Mayday"!
Well, here's my ride.
Listen, uh, next year, how about I have a little Monte Cristo sandwich waiting for me by the chimney?
- Bob, there's something-- - Ah, I almost forgot.
- For us?
Well "Mozart: Live at Emperor Joseph's Court"?
Wow!
I recorded it myself.
Wolfy was really hot that night.
"An invitation to a meeting of the minds at Stephen Hawking's".
Oh, my goodness.
I've dreamed about this.
That's why no one ever stays mad at Santa.
So the next time you're abroad, remember my simple rule, Kielbasa and sauerkraut, yes.
Kielbasa and menudo and haggis, no.
I'll get it.
- Merry Christmas.
- Harvey.
I got you a present.
Oh, a mouse.
In grey.
That goes with everything.
I was planning to get you the whole computer, but then they took all those taxes out of my paycheque.
Well, it was a wonderful thought.
So was it fun playing Santa?
- Well, it's hard work.
- Don't I know it.
Oh, you'll never believe this.
I got a call from the department store.
Apparently, all the kids who came to see me got exactly what they asked for.
It's like a miracle.
You're welcome.
I mean, oh, look!
Mistletoe.
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
Oh, boy!
The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart.
How'd you know my other album got all scratched?
This is for you, Zeldy.
I made it the mortal way.
Really?
No.
What'd you get me?
Something you'll really like.
Johnny Mathis?
Cool.
This is the best Christmas ever.
O holy night The stars are brightly shining It is the night Of our dear saviour's birth Great.
I didn't get anything for Johnny.
Long may the world
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Ooh, here comes Aunt Hilda and Mr. Kraft.
- Ten bucks says he kisses her.
- Twenty bucks says she throws up.
And that is why I packed up everything I owned into my '72 Dodge Dart.
And I just left Muncie and headed for Westbridge.
- Uh-huh.
Good night.
- You know, I had a wonderful time tonight, Hilda.
A heavy heart, Beloved, Have I borne From year to year Until I saw thy face Oh, would you look at the time?
I really, really--  Isn't that your car rolling down the hill?
Oh, good Lord.
Quick.
She's coming.
Hey.
What are you guys doing?
A heavy heart, Beloved, I have borne - From year to year - Hold me, Willard.
A cat is doing an imitation of me kissing my niece's vice principal.
So this is my lowest moment.
- So where did Mr. Kraft take you?
- The cattle auction.
There's a man who likes his beef fresh.
No, he just likes to know the price of cattle.
We skipped dinner.
He's on a diet.
Whenever he's hungry, he drinks iced tea.
He hasn't lost any weight, but at least he's jittery.
I don't know what to say.
Is that a fun date for people your age?
No.
Willard's one of those people who hit middle age and just forgot how to have fun.
Hildegard Antoinette Spellman.
You used my labtop again without asking.
And then there are some people who are middle-aged their whole lives.
The purpose of the labtop is to help discover cures for the problems of the world.
Not to make fudge.
I'm sorry, Zelda.
Boy, this has not been a good night for me.
You don't have to go out with Mr. Kraft anymore.
- I'm seeing him again this weekend.
- What?
- What?
- Well, he may be a bad date, but when you live as long as we do, you have a lot of Friday nights to fill.
Well, I feel refreshed.
Oh, here.
Maybe I can help.
Have you ever tried anger therapy?
Now try it.
Oh!
Oh It usually works on the one in the faculty lounge.
Sabrina, look.
The PTA is sponsoring a ski trip to Vermont this weekend.
Let's sign up.
I can't believe the PTA came up with something fun to do.
Let's see how they ruin this.
I'm so glad they picked you to chaperon the ski trip.
Well, you know my motto: fun, with discipline.
Did your hope die first or mine?
Motion passed.
All nut items will be eliminated from future bake sales due to janitor Bill's allergic reaction.
And I am told he is finally breathing on his own again.
Okay, next up: We need to vote on how to spend the money that last year's seniors left.
Loser.
- Heard that.
Well, I think we should spend it sponsoring the cheerleaders to go to a unique cheerleading workshop in France.
Oh, please.
So the brightest and best of today's youth taking their American values over to the godless countries in Europe.
I think that is a nifty idea.
Any other proposals?
I think we should get a drinking fountain that works.
Not only would it benefit our class, but the entire student body.
Uh-huh.
Okay, well, let's vote.
Those in favour of the drinking fountain, raise their hands.
All those in favour of sending our cheerleaders to camp, raise their hands.
Okay.
Motion passed.
Congratulations, Libby.
Enjoy Europe.
More people raised their hands in favour of the water fountain.
And I used my veto to overrule them.
But I thought a student government was democratic.
And I am certain that our forefathers would have wanted our cheerleaders to see Paris.
And Brussels on the weekend.
Sabrina, have you been using my labtop again without asking?
If you're proud of my initiative, then yes?
Well, I'm not.
That gonna make dressing a problem?
What did you make with my labtop?
Hair mousse, but you would really understand if you could have seen what my hair looked like that day.
I am making a new house rule: No one plays with my labtop, period, now matter how hungry you are, - no matter how ungroomed.
- But what if--?
- No.
- And how about if--?
No.
She's waffling.
Okay, now, in order to ensure everyone's safety on this trip, I have established a few simple guidelines.
"No snacking between meals.
- Lights out at 8:00"?
- "No laughing"?
And since we'll be staying at my ex-father-in-law's condo to save a little bit of money, everyone will have to pitch in with the chores.
- Will we get paid?
- You will be paid with up to 45 minutes a day of ski time, mister.
Since it's about ten minutes until school starts, I'm sure you've got some homework you've forgotten or some property to destroy.
Coming through.
Obviously, he's never been loved.
That's sad.
Perfectly understandable, but sad.
The guy's completely forgotten what it's like to be a teenager.
If only there was some way to remind him.
- I'll be back before homeroom's over.
- Where you going?
To zap-- A-dee doo-dah into the hall.
See you.
You sure about this?
Zelda was pretty explicit about not going near this thing.
She said not to play with it.
She also said the labtop was for curing problems of the world.
Mr. Kraft is definitely a problem of the world.
Whatever.
If she knew you were brewing a potion to make Mr. Kraft understand teenagers, I know what she'd say.
Hint: It rhymes with "whoa".
Oh, it worked.
- Candy?
- No.
I'd probably break out.
"For a teenager's outlook on life, take three candies.
Caution: May result in the ability to eat an entire box of cereal".
Perfect.
I'll just slip a few into his iced tea.
The game is afoot.
All right, you clowns, get down from there.
Have you nothing better to do than climb the cafeter--?
Cafeteria?
Be in my office in five minutes.
This is a school, not a bordello.
Miss Spellman, why have you been following me around all morning?
It's your cologne, Mr. Kraft.
It's so great that I wanna buy some for my friend Harvey.
Well, you can think about my Old Spice in detention.
- But what's my crime?
- Smelling the vice principal.
Now, that's funny.
I seem to be out of detention slips.
You just wait right here while I go to the supply closet.
Now what are you doing with my iced tea?
I just thought you might be thirsty.
Miss Spellman kissing up is a way of life, not just something you do when it suits you.
Mr. Kraft, are you all right?
We need tunes.
What is this?
Ha.
"Detention".
You can feel "de" tension in "de" room, huh?
We got the ski-trip chores.
I have to paint the living room.
Mr. Barber.
Loser.
- Mr. Kraft.
- Hey.
You want something?
Hiyo!
Let's hear it for Gordie.
Nice move.
So the ski trip?
I am packing supplies for water balloons.
- Do we still have to clean the place?
- No, we'll just fake it.
You know, spread potpourri everywhere, make sure there's paper in the johns.
Hey, did I ever tell you guys about the time my toenail got infected?
It turned, like, completely green.
Excuse me, Mr. Kraft.
- What?
Sign this so the cheerleaders can get our trip approved.
Later.
- Please?
It falls off.
I took the liberty of filling in all pesky blank parts.
Give me.
Anyway, then the nail falls off.
Next day, I find the thing floating around in my sock.
How gross is that?
Okay.
There.
- Super.
- You really want this, don't you, huh?
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?
You want it?
You want it?
Harvey, think fast.
Harvey, I'm open.
Harvey.
Who was that to, Kinkle?
Ew.
Oh, here's the world's smallest violin playing the world's saddest song just for you.
Wow.
He seems different.
I know.
You're kidding.
He played "Smells Like Teen Spirit" with his nose?
Four verses.
This spell is working way better than expected.
Unbelievable.
I wonder how it's affecting his date with Hilda.
He's on a date with Aunt Hilda?
Willard, I can't tell you how much fun I had tonight.
How did you ever guess that man's weight?
Oh, that was easy.
You know, he's just a big tub of goo.
- Ha-ha.
Well - Ha.
Well Jeez, I Wow.
Touchdown, Kraft.
Hi, Aunt Hilda.
How was your date?
Great.
We threw softballs at clowns.
We held hands at the fun house.
We spit off the monorail.
I'm crazy about Willard Kraft.
Okay, so she's in love with someone who's under a spell, but at least I'm not in trouble.
Is that the bus?
No, that's the same street sweeper that went by ten minutes ago.
He'd better get here.
I'm starting to feel a camaraderie with you people.
Well, here comes Mr. Kraft.
I'm sure there's an explanation.
Mr. Kraft, why is the bus so late?
Hire the bus.
I told my mother to remind me.
I'm sorry.
Well, okay, so I goofed.
It's just not the end of the world.
- I'm sure we can fix this somehow.
- What can we do?
I know.
I'll race you to the arcade.
I really think we should stay here and make sure everyone gets a ride home.
Okay, you do that.
Come on.
If you leave, I'm going to have to report you.
He'll be back with some help.
Right.
After he stops mooning us.
Why are the halls such a mess?
Didn't you hear?
Mr. Kraft forgot to pay the janitors, so they're on strike.
Avoid the bathrooms.
You're kidding.
I didn't know he took care of that.
Or that.
Why has he been acting totally weird lately?
I hadn't really noticed.
Listen up, butt-brains.
Everyone has to write a report on last night's Team Knight Rider.
Faked you out.
Ha-ha.
Okay, maybe he has been acting a little strange.
Gotta go.
- Salem, it's me.
- So, what's the haps?
It's the spell.
You gotta find something in the magic book to reverse it.
Mr. Kraft keeps getting younger and younger.
Freeze.
N.Y.P.D.
We're going downtown.
And I think he's been watching way too much TV.
What's going on?
Why isn't anyone eating?
Mr. Kraft forgot to sign the food order.
And it was tamale day.
Who would have thought?
Guess Mr. Kraft is in charge of more stuff than just detention.
I'm hungry, and I'm not very nice when I'm hungry.
So it's a nutrition problem.
Mr. Kraft, all these students are very hungry, and there is no food.
Well, you're a girl.
Go fix lunch.
That's Neanderthal.
"That's Neanderthal".
Mr. Kraft, the students need lunch, and they need it now.
Well I have two Rolos, a jawbreaker, some ABC gum and I'm willing to share.
You are the vice principal of this school, and it is your responsibility to order the darn food.
- Is not.
- Is too.
Not, not, not, not, infinity.
I can't talk to you.
This is a ridiculous conversation.
- Is not.
- Oh, don't.
I'm hungry.
We have the statewide exams coming up in a week, and one of the things that's gonna be on them is quadratic equations.
This is Vice Principal Kraft.
He makes three times what I do.
Now that I have your attention, I just wanted to say that even though lunch today was, like, totally not my fault, I'm gonna make it up to you guys by letting you go home for three weeks.
Three weeks?
We'll never get ready for the exams.
We'll lose our accreditation.
But we'll catch up on our soaps.
Oh, uh, your uncle is calling you on the pay phone.
Uncle Salem?
What'd you find out?
You didn't mix the potion with hemlock, - did you?
- Course not.
That's the only way it could mess up, unless you mixed it with caffeine, but no one's that stupid.
I did.
I mixed it with caffeine in iced tea.
Oh, no.
Everyone knows you don't put an aging potion in with caffeine.
Did the Surgeon General make that warning?
It causes the container to absorb the potion.
Every time Mr. Kraft makes a pitcher of iced tea, he gets more potion.
I have to get that carafe.
Yes, and be careful, 99.
What?
You are so young.
Ha!
Mr. Kraft, I didn't know you were in here, uh, but then again, I didn't look in what appears to be your fort.
But since you are here, I'll go.
Tag.
You're it.
You're never gonna catch me.
You're right, I'm very bad at this game.
I quit.
Tag, I'm it.
All right, um, pain tag.
If I catch you, I give you pain.
- I don't wanna play.
Ow!
- Indian burn.
You're it.
- Heavy pillow tag.
- No fair.
No fair.
Ow!
I'm telling.
Did you get the carafe?
No, but apparently I have cooties.
There has to be some other solution.
Good luck.
I've torn that book apart looking.
Literally.
Well, there's only one thing to do.
I'm gonna have to ask an aunt.
Might I suggest Aunt Bea?
She was nice.
- Hi.
- Hi, sweetie.
I didn't hear you come in.
Well, I'm in, and I'm studying witch stuff, and I need some help.
Sure.
Uh, don't touch that green goo.
It's a little radioactive.
Let's say a person put a spell on another person, and they thought that spell would end at a certain time, but it didn't.
- Who'd you put a spell on?
- Aunt Zelda, it's hypothetical.
So how would you reverse this hypothetical problem spell?
Well, first, I'd tell my aunt what's going on.
Where's Aunt Hilda?
Maybe she can help.
- She's on a date with Mr. Kraft.
- Really?
Willard, would you mind getting off the floor?
I'm bored.
Then why don't we talk?
I had a great time the other night.
I don't remember when I laughed so much.
What are you doing?
Oh.
Here.
Ecch.
Oh, here comes our food.
- Here's your petite fillet.
- Thank you.
Here's your chocolate sundae.
- Anything else?
- More cherries.
Wish I was brave enough to order dessert for dinner, but then I like my health.
- I want that.
- Oh.
I'm the same way.
Someone's food always looks better, but not this time.
Oh, how romantic.
- Are you okay?
- I wanna go home.
Well, I'd like to finish my meal.
- I wanna go home.
- Stop that.
Would your date like some crayons?
Um, no, but could you just put a rush order on the cherries?
Sabrina.
You know, these days a lot of restaurants will put leftovers in a bag for you.
- Where's Mr. Kraft?
- Oh, he's asleep in the car.
The ride really tuckered him out, poor little fella.
Well, I'm pretty tuckered out myself.
- Good night.
- Hold it.
What spell did you put on Willard?
Before you start pointing fingers, remember one important fact: Sabrina put me up to it.
Are you gonna finish that potato morsel on your collar?
What are you making?
It's an anti-youth potion.
One part prune juice, one part Miami Beach tap water, with just a pinch of Buddy Ebsen salt.
I'll give him the medicine.
Hate to say this, but I can't wait to get the old Mr. Kraft back.
You don't change people's personalities.
And if you do, you don't mix it with caffeine.
All right, Mr. Kraft, let's get your dignity back.
Here comes the choo-choo train.
Choo-choo, choo-choo That noise is going on your permanent record, Sabrina.
What's going on here?
How did I end up here?
We were at dinner and, uh, you got sick and passed out.
Oh, dear Lord, what happened to you?
Had to dive across the nachos to keep you from hitting your head.
- Good one.
- Oh, thank you.
Listen, I insist on buying you another dinner, and I'm not leaving here until you say yes.
Say yes.
- Oh, all right.
Wonderful.
Sabrina Something very odd is going on here, and I can't help but think you were responsible.
Oh, well, you know, that could be sign of a concussion.
Well, we will visit this area again, hmm?
- Hilda, Tuesday?
- Mm-hm.
Black Angus night at the stockyards.
If I come home with a steer, it's sleeping in your bedroom.
Really?
Too much iced tea?
It's the only thing my doctor could think of.
Here you are.
- Detention?
What for?
- New policy.
Detention is now based solely on personal resentments.
Hi, Libby.
Libby, what's the matter?
What's the matter?
I thought you believed in the work of cheerleaders, but it turns out that you are no more than an-- An educator.
Libby, isn't that a little harsh?
Especially since you haven't seen this yet.
Three tickets to the Loire Valley cheerleading symposium?
Oh, Mr. Kraft, I'm I'm all choked up.
I'd give you something for your dry throat, but I'm afraid our drinking fountain is still broken.
Well, looks like the Mr. Kraft we've always known and loved is back.
Yeah.
It's nice to have lunch and lights and a clean school.
I guess we should be grateful for him.
- What--?
- Now I'm grateful.
Okay, so I ruined the ski trip for everyone, and I turned the school inside out.
But isn't being grounded enough?
Why do I have to mix this stuff up?
It's just Zelda's way of teaching us to respect the labtop.
Why would she have me make Limburger frappÃ©?
This stuff smells like something that's already been eaten.
Come on, how bad could it be?
It's just cheese.
Ugh!
Oh Salem?
Aunt Hilda, Aunt Zelda.
Help!
Salem's fainted.
Oh, Salem, you are brilliant.
Mm.
Mm Easy, easy.
Don't choke.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
I've done it.
I'm on the verge of one of the greatest scientific breakthroughs in the history of mankind.
How incredible.
Are you gonna finish that toast?
You know that formula I've been working on?
- I've found the key ingredient.
- Liquorice?
Don't be silly, Sabrina.
Liquorice won't cure allergies.
It's ostrich saliva.
The hard part is getting them to drool.
Let me see that.
Oh!
Wow.
One drop of that and the whole kitchen is spotlessly clean.
I'll say.
The walls, the table, the counters-- - Salem.
- I'm blond.
My IQ just dropped 20 points.
Blond, blond, blond.
Dead.
See you.
What's all the flap?
I got a postcard from Valerie.
She's really enjoying her trip to D.C. "Hi, everyone, I visited the Vietnam Memorial, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, and J.F.K.'s grave.
This place is really fun".
Sounds like a big loser town to me.
I have an important announcement to make.
The school will be entering a float in the town's Democracy Daze celebration.
Great, I get to hear my dad's Grenada story again.
Now, who would like to be in charge of putting the float together?
Oh, my.
Well, I think this would be the perfect opportunity for the two of you to embody our democracy's two-party system and work together.
What?
Libby.
I've got a great idea for the float.
I say we display some of our major headlines using recycled newspaper.
No, no, no.
The newspaper print would get all over the cheerleaders' uniforms.
Why would cheerleaders be on a float with a newspaper theme?
They're always on the front page, duh.
What?
Man, this house is so spotless and germ-free, Howard Hughes could live here.
Zelda, if we could market this stuff, we'd make a fortune.
Good luck.
The FDA will never approve of ostrich saliva.
Those pencil-pushing bureaucrats have ruined many a dream.
Well, we could still sell it in the Other Realm.
- What do you say, Zeldie?
- No.
I made this formula to cure allergies and end suffering, not to whiten.
You ever cleaned a toilet?
That's suffering.
Besides, you said it didn't even cure allergies.
Yet.
Medical breakthroughs take time.
Get off my back.
This is why Pasteur broke up with you.
He told me he had to work out stuff with his mother.
You gotta hand it to Zelda.
She's a pillar of integrity.
Yeah.
Let's steal her formula.
The school guidelines state that the float is required to have flowers.
- The rest of the design is up to me.
- Don't you mean "us"?
Well, I'll be using "me" as shorthand for "us".
I've already got the floral design in my head.
Oh.
Well, I'm glad your butt is working.
Oh, I'll be using "butt" as shorthand for "your head".
The coast is clear.
Operation Find the Allergy Formula That Also Cleans, Don't Get Caught, And Make a Lot of Money is under way.
You start looking, and I'll start working on a shorter code name.
Ha-ha.
Aah!
Harvey.
What are you doing under there?
Souping up the engine.
This baby will be able to go 90 miles an hour.
But we're behind the World War II veterans.
Haven't they suffered enough?
Perfect.
Libby, we agreed this would be my side.
Oh.
I'm sorry.
I thought we wanted the float to look nice.
- Found it.
- Hallelujah.
What in the Other Realm's name is going on here?
- Lost my wallet?
- She's telling the truth, I swear.
And now that I've found it, Salem and I will just get back to work and clean up.
Are we ever gonna clean up.
Ha-ha.
Wrong, wrong, wrong.
Libby, leave my side alone.
Sorry, I will not allow the town to be subjected to this.
That's it, I can't take it anymore.
To keep us out of each other's faces Keep Libby away at least five paces And, Sab-- Ooh!
I said "cheerful" and you picked yellow?
Me and my finger.
Now, that's teamwork.
- What are you doing here?
- I'm the spell police.
The distance spell you put on Libby is illegal.
- Why?
- Because you can't distance yourself from your problems.
- Really?
Watch.
- Freeze.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to cite you.
"If a distance spell is enacted, it will be reversed"?
Huh?
Instead of Libby staying away from you, you have to stay next to Libby.
- What?
- And if you do happen to move more than five paces away, something terrible will happen.
Something that will scare you to the depths of your soul.
Say hi to Libby for me.
You're a disgrace to your badge!
Ew.
You are so right.
Ha-ha.
You know, when I said "Ew" just now, I wasn't being rhetorical.
Aah Satisfied?
You just scared off a cute guy with your freak pheromones.
Don't you dare look in my locker.
I wasn't.
My, uh, new locker's here.
- Where are you going?
- To cheerleading practise.
Ready, get lost.
Hey, you know, that would make a good story for the school paper: "A Day in the Life of a Cheerleader".
But you despise cheerleaders.
And cheerleaders despise you.
You're afraid I'll write a puff piece.
Well, look, don't worry-- Here it comes.
This dungeon stone is white, but what would you call this one?
- Bright.
- Exactly.
And that's why for the next 20 minutes, we'll be telling you how you can get your house this clean with new Scientist in a Drum.
And now here's Bruce Jenner to tell you more.
I don't believe it.
You marketed my formula.
And with a poorly produced informercial.
I'm taking this matter to the Other Realm copyright court.
The toaster.
"Send me four bottles of Scientist in a Drum".
"Send ten bottles.
Everything you've got".
These are all orders for our cleanser from the Other Realm, after the first minute.
But I wanted this formula to be used for the common good.
We polled the common good.
They don't wanna be helped.
Come on, Zeldie, we need your help.
Well, I guess if surfaces are clean, that would mean a lot less dust, which could mean a lot less asthma.
Exactly.
You know, Mr. Clean was this close to getting the Nobel Prize.
Come on.
What do you say?
All right, I'll do it.
For mankind.
Okay, let's do it again.
Sabrina, if you insist on actually doing the cheers, you have to stop screaming, "Please let me die".
Ready.
Okay.
Westbridge, Westbridge Wow, wow, wow Stronger, faster, holier than thou  Whoo!
Go Westbridge!
- Harvey.
- Sabrina.
Cheerleading?
- I lost a bet.
- Okay, you guys, go take a break.
You can get a drink of water and think about how you can be more like me.
You wanna go to the Slicery and grab a bite?
I'd love to.
But I promised Libby I'd sit alarmingly close to her.
Why have you decided to become my shadow all of a sudden?
Well, I figured since we're gonna be working together, you know, maybe we could find a common ground.
Any ground I found with you would indeed be common.
Ha-ha.
Ha.
You know, um, wait.
I'm just trying to get to know you better.
Well, I'm popular, confident, nonfreakish: everything you're not.
And if you insist on traipsing after me, could you at least wear a higher-quality perfume?
Okay, enough.
Nothing is worth this.
I don't care what happens to me.
Libby.
Oh, no.
I turned her into a puzzle.
"For ages 3 and up"?
- What's that?
- I didn't do anything.
Oh I never knew working with numbers could be so sensual.
- Water.
Must have water.
- Well, make it quick.
We need you back in that lab, making lots more of this stuff.
Come on, chop, chop.
Excuse me, but since I invented the product, maybe I should be running the business.
You seem to assume that you're in charge.
If you wanna do everything I do, be my guest.
Okay, exactly what is it you do?
- Plenty.
- Stop fighting.
We're rich.
And I didn't have to marry Martha Raye.
Aunt Hilda, Aunt Zelda!
Help!
What's the matter?
- Look.
Uh-oh.
A Libby puzzle.
- Sabrina, did you blow up a mortal?
- She started it.
I told her something bad would happen if she stepped away from Libby.
You can't distance yourself from your problems.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, so I've heard.
What am I supposed to do?
All the cheerleaders are expecting her.
I can't tell them their leader has turned into a rainy-day activity.
You have to assemble her.
- And then she'll be all right?
- If you do it right.
- Help.
- Of course.
Now, try to calm down.
I know making a classmate explode can be stressful, but I've always found puzzles very relaxing.
Is that all there is?
The box is empty.
How can we be missing pieces?
Didn't you read the fine print?
"Some pieces not included in box"?
What a rip-off.
I guess you didn't see this, either.
If you don't find the missing pieces and put them in before the sand runs out, Libby will be a puzzle forever.
- What?
- Boy, in the final analysis, the Libby puzzle isn't much fun, is it?
How am I to find these pieces?
You have to explore her life, and quickly.
You know, I bet other teenagers get to spend their evenings watching TV.
Zeldie, I feel bad.
We should be able to work together without fighting.
I mean, we are more mature than Libby and Sabrina.
- I agree.
Let's get back to business.
- But I'm still in charge, right?
Aah!
Whoever's in charge, get in here, and bring some Wet-Naps.
Make that a fire extinguisher.
Ugh Gross.
Well, the piece isn't in Libby's leftover lunch.
- Only 45 minutes left.
- Will you stop with that?
I'm worried about Libby.
I need to concentrate.
That's good, because you only have 44 minutes left.
Forty-three fifty.
Ooh-- I'm not finding anything.
Aah!
Harvey.
Have you met my friend--?
Invisible.
- My friend Susie?
Remind me to introduce you sometime.
By the way, um, you didn't happen to see any jigsaw-puzzle pieces under there, did you?
No.
But to tell you the truth, I was taking a nap.
There's something really soothing about being under an engine, but I don't know what it is.
The fumes?
- Shh Sure gotta go.
Ha.
We're down to about a half an hour.
Okay, I admit it.
I like holding up the hourglass.
Maybe the piece will be in Libby's locker.
I think this one is hers.
Ha-ha Sabrina, I hate to interrupt your conversation with the voices in your head, but have you seen Libby?
Libby?
Uh No, I haven't.
But don't worry.
I'm sure she'll pull herself together real soon.
Look.
Look at this notebook.
It looks like Libby had a tutor help her in math.
- Weird.
- Why are you so surprised?
Didn't you know she was bad at math?
Yeah, but what's surprising is she cares that she's bad at math.
Sounds like you learned a little something about Libby.
And here's a piece of the puzzle.
Look, it's got Libby's address on the back.
Well, might I suggest we go there?
- Especially since we-- - Oh, get a hobby.
I don't care.
I don't want Marge in my bridge club.
She's a kook.
Have you seen what she calls furniture?
Ew.
Hold on.
- Mrs. Chessler?
- Yes.
Hi, I'm Sabrina.
I'm a friend of Libby's, and I left a book here that I came to pick up - that time when you weren't here.
- Mm-hm.
I don't care.
I don't want Marge in my house.
You're not exactly on my A list either, kook.
Well, I can see where Libby gets her meanness from.
Exactly.
And I believe that would be another piece to the puzzle.
Are you gonna cry?
Because I'll hang up.
Oh, I was just reminding you that we're-- I'm still here.
I'll just go get that book now.
Told you that one was the bathroom.
Let's try this one.
Yup, this is Libby's room, all right.
- But where do we start?
- Check the last piece of the puzzle.
Uh "One of these things is not like the other".
One of these things Just doesn't belong Can you guess?
At least I'm not holding up the hourglass.
Well, when it comes to photography, Libby has really specific tastes.
But what stands out?
Look.
This frame is purple.
All the others are gold.
And there's something on the back.
"Buy 20 gold frames, get one purple frame free".
- Yeah, now only ten minutes left.
- I know.
But we can't panic.
If we're gonna find the puzzle piece, we have to be painstakingly methodical.
I have a feeling Libby's gonna know someone was in her room.
You think?
I swear, even as a puzzle, Libby's getting on my nerves.
Wait a minute.
This one thing is definitely not like the others.
Looks like we found a sweet grandmother.
Look at the note.
"Dear, dear Libby: Sweet of you to take me to the ballet.
Your birthday, it'll be you and me on the roller coaster of your choice.
Love, Grandma".
This is it.
And there's nothing on the back.
This has gotta be the last piece.
Let's go home.
Wait a minute, I'll zap us back.
We only have a few minutes left.
MRS.
Is everything okay?
- Oh, no, the room.
- Did you find that book?
- Just now.
- And here it is.
- Good.
Do you wanna stay and see Libby?
You can wait in the garage.
- Don't do it.
She'll turn on the car.
- No, thank you.
Okay, but we're expecting her any minute.
Really?
Then I better hurry.
I mean go.
And this is the piece that came out of her tutoring notebook.
She must consider poor math skills her Achilles' heel.
This is the one that came off her mother.
Oh.
That must be her cold shoulder.
And this is the one that came from her grandmother's picture.
I know where this goes.
Her heart.
Oh, no, there's still a piece missing.
And time just ran out.
Don't worry, that piece doesn't exist yet.
It's Libby's compassion for others.
Now, you have to gradually fill that space by showing compassion for Libby even when she doesn't show it for you.
In other words, learn to work together.
- I get it.
- Mm-hm.
And by the way, could this lesson be any more heavy-handed?
Well, I could've been behind a pulpit.
See you.
What is going on?
What am I doing here?
Oh, you just came by to see if I needed a ride.
- I don't.
- I would not.
I'm getting out of here.
Uh, wait, Libby.
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.
Once again, weirdness reigns whenever "Safreakna's" around.
Oh, yeah, sympathy for Libby.
Piece of cake.
You know, Libby, I have to admit, your side of the float is looking pretty good.
I'm glad you're willing to state the obvious.
Oh, well, I I'm going to accept that as a compliment.
Then you could use a dictionary.
Libby, um, I could use some help with my crepe paper.
I have a box of matches.
But it's just that I wanted to get done this weekend so I could, uh, visit my grandma.
Oh.
Well, I would hate for part of the float to look like you did it.
- Okay, I'll help.
- Thanks.
You know, Libby, sometimes you're a real puzzle.
No talking.
Zelda, we have a problem.
Come, now, don't let the pressure get to you.
A strong business requires a strong stomach.
I'm gonna be sick.
It turns out your cleanser is more versatile than we thought.
It not only cleans, it also turns people into mutants.
Well, how do you know that happens to everyone?
What if--?
- Gross.
Help!
Oh People are demanding their money back.
And I already put a down payment on a condo in Florida.
- This is all your fault.
- My fault?
I'm not the one who invented an allergy cure and then tried to pawn it off as a cleanser.
- I never should've-- - I cannot be held responsible-- You corrupted me with your supply-side economics.
- You just-- - Hey!
You guys.
Why can't we learn to get along?
Sabrina learned to get along with Libby.
You're right.
- Thanks.
- I mean this with all of my love: Don't touch me.
Libby, Sabrina, I just want to thank you both for working together and doing such a good job.
I love the way you took two different themes and integrated them together.
My idea.
You don't have to let her take the credit.
I've met her mother.
Hey, Sabrina.
How's it going with Libby?
Well, I'm beginning to understand her, yet I still wanna wring her neck.
- It's the best of both worlds.
- Cool.
Say, do you mind if I hang around for a bit?
- I've never been on a float before.
- Oh, that's sweet.
And you just happen to be in the middle of my "Agents of Destruction" video game.
Oh, no.
Fire in the hole!
Well, I have to admit, you were right, Aunt Hilda.
Jigsaw puzzles are really relaxing.
It's the perfect way to wile away a rainy afternoon.
The fact that it's sunny and unseasonably warm outside takes nothing away from the fun.
You know, Sabrina, I don't think I told you this, but in my opinion, your Democracy Daze float was the best.
Thanks.
It did turn out great.
It's going to stand as a monument to your creative talent and democratic spirit.
Not really.
When we got back to the school, the engine Harvey had been working on blew up and the whole thing burned to the ground.
Ever reminding us that democracy is a fragile thing.
Just a few more pieces left.
This puzzle's pretty easy, considering the subject is so hard to live with.
Hurry up and finish my nose.
I need to sneeze.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
MAN : Tonight, I'll host an "Eye on Sorcery" special on the upcoming Witches Council Elections.
Richard Langston is my favourite anchorman on the Witch Channel.
Oh, I know.
He's so trustworthy.
But now, this just in from the Department of Health, Education and Magic: And he's a free-range anchorman.
There have been confirmed reports of a finger-flu epidemic.
The flu, which affects your pointing finger, can be contagious.
So be sure to bundle up those fingers.
Did you guys look outside this morning?
It's so sunny, it's almost like spring.
Yes.
And you're wearing a very nice spring outfit.
Ah.
The only thing that's missing is: Mittens?
The last time I wore mittens, everybody teased me.
- It almost ruined kindergarten for me.
- Sabrina, there's a finger-flu alert.
And as a young witch, you're highly susceptible to it.
Okay, I know you guys mean well, but what's worse than wearing mittens in school?
Okay.
Point made.
Sabrina the Greek, not "geek".
Can I borrow your history book?
I left mine at home.
Sure.
What's with the mittens?
Eczema?
No.
I promised my aunts I'd wear them, but there was no time frame on that promise.
Why am I allowed to live?
I think there are laws.
I put my idea for a town meeting on Mrs. Quick's desk.
Oh, no.
The person you want to read it will actually read it?
So you see what an awful situation it is.
Valerie, you're the only person I know that has to work up to low self-esteem.
I know.
The other day I saw this book called How to Be Confident, and I almost bought it.
But I was afraid the cashier would make fun of me.
Oh, well, you know, actually, I bought myself a copy.
Here.
You can borrow it.
Oh, wow.
Thanks, Sabrina.
Does it work?
Has the Oprah Book Club been wrong yet?
- Valerie, I read your-- - I'm sorry.
No.
I think your town-meeting idea is wonderful.
Really?
You're not just saying that?
No, believe me.
If I didn't like your proposal, I'd be avoiding you right now.
I'm afraid of confrontation.
Hey.
I asked for extra Tater Tots.
This is working already.
Ha-ha.
Oh, that's right.
It's the lunch lady's last day.
I heard Mr. Kraft's gonna make a speech in Miss Tornnanis' honour.
Uh-oh.
Whenever Mr. Kraft makes an announcement in the cafeteria, you open your mouth and get us all in trouble.
- That is not true, is it, Harvey?
- Very true.
- Attention, everyone.
- Here he comes.
- Pretend you don't know me.
- Today, we honour a woman who for the past 40 years has fed us our lunches and given us our change.
Her dedication knows no bounds.
She even served us food through her long bout with mono.
And so, for you, Ingrid Tornnanis, our appreciation and this golden hairnet.
Oh, nothing to worry about.
Just a vat of sloppy joes spilled.
You wanna get that?
Okay, and I'll mail you this.
Let's hear it for Mrs. Tornnanis.
She shouldn't have to clean that up.
I mean, without a bucket.
Anyway, moving on I would now like to announce her replacement.
- You.
- What?
Mm-hm.
That's right.
All of you will be replacing Mrs. Tornnanis.
What kind of crazy--?
Hey, Mr. Kraft is talking.
You will be divided up into groups of three and assigned lunch shifts.
And this means all of you.
You mean, I'm going to have to be of service to others?
Ha-ha.
Except for cheerleaders and football players.
They've done more than their share for the school already.
All right.
I'm off the hook.
And, of course, this applies only to the first-string football players.
That is so unfair.
Run.
Save yourselves.
So, once again, little Miss Contrarian has said her little piece, huh?
Well, I am happy to announce that the first team of three to pull cafeteria duty will be Spellman, Kinkle and their little friend.
Sorry.
- What's wrong with your hand?
- My finger feels weird.
Sorry about you being second string.
Sorry about you in general.
And the three of you can start by cleaning this up right now.
I didn't say anything.
Zellie, brush me.
Salem, I brushed you this morning.
I don't have time.
I think the neighbour is stealing our paper.
- Hilda, I have a knot.
- Salem.
What makes you think that?
Well, his shirt is all bulgy, and the paper's gone.
I'm gonna put an Indian burial ground under his house.
No, you're not.
That sort of thing affects the neighbourhood.
- It's real uncomfortable.
- Salem, you do not have a knot.
Oh, you're not coming down with something, are you?
It's probably just allergies.
I'd check the pollen count if I had the paper.
Now let me make you some tea just in case.
Do you want a blanket?
Hilda gets attention just because she might be sick.
Hey.
Oh, no.
Not you too, Salem.
Oh, yeah.
Bring it on.
Slow down.
Oh, Mr. Kraft.
- Yes.
- I've been wondering, do you think it's such a good idea to have the students work during lunch?
No.
I don't think it's a good idea.
I think it's a brilliant idea.
And if Einstein had had these kind of money-saving ideas, he could have afforded a haircut.
Okay, I was just wondering.
Mrs. Quick.
Um, I had an extra copy of this book, and I thought you might be interested.
"How to Be Confident"?
You know, from a literary standpoint.
Oh, don't worry.
I'm not offended.
I just hope it's more effective than Confidence for Dummies.
I think I'm getting worse.
Either that, or you do a lousy Jerry Lewis impersonation.
Pretty sure my liver's involved.
Maybe if you would scratch behind my ears - Ah - Well, you don't feel hot.
But maybe I should take your temperature.
Under the tongue.
Under the tongue.
Open up.
All right.
I'll check it in a few minutes.
This ought to do it.
Uh-huh.
So, what you're saying is that this "Westbridge town meeting" will actually encourage the students to express their opinions?
- Exactly.
- Mm-hm.
Oh, why don't we just let the students run the school?
That'll make for some high SATs.
- But-- - No name calling.
I said no town meeting.
- Miss Spellman.
- Hey, Mr. Kraft.
And they say we don't have mice.
Ha!
Oh, poor Salem.
We didn't realise you were running such a high temperature.
I don't wanna be a burden.
As long as you drop everything and stay focused on me, I should be fine.
- Sabrina.
- Sabrina.
I'm too weak to lie.
I didn't wear my mittens today.
I told you we should have glued them on.
Remind me to scold you when you're not such a pathetic figure.
I'm just gonna zap myself into bed.
- Gross.
- Here's some chicken soup.
It's good for you.
No, dear.
It's for your finger.
Did I mention:  - Sabrina.
- Yes?
- Where do you think you're going?
- School.
Let's see your finger.
- Oh, it looks fine.
- Come on.
Ugh.
Not only have you got finger flu, but you've obviously gone blind.
I've got to go to school.
I can't let Harvey and Valerie do lunch duty without me.
The whole thing's my fault.
You're staying home today.
And that's that.
Salem's still sick.
The two of you can keep each other company.
- Where is he?
- Ha-ha-ha.
I don't care what the critics say.
"Doonesbury" makes Alzheimer's funny.
Oh, I feel awful.
Oh All I've done all day is eat, sleep and stare off into space.
What an awful existence.
Hey.
I don't dump on your lifestyle.
I just can't enjoy myself knowing that Harvey and Valerie have to serve lunch all by themselves.
We interrupt our regularly scheduled programme for a special report.
Chaos at Westbridge High School.
And just let me assure the public that we do have the situation under control.
I'll be seeing to it that the two lunch servers who caused this fracas will be expelled.
They are Harvey Kinkle and Valerie Birkhead.
They will be expelled, impaled on stakes and paraded through town.
Sources say this would have never happened if they hadn't been shorthanded.
Oh, no.
I gotta get to school.
Some people just don't know how to enjoy being sick.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Where do you want me?
Oh, Sabrina.
I thought you were sick.
I couldn't let them turn you guys into kebabs.
Okay, well, she obviously still has a fever.
Oh, no.
We're out of tapioca pudding.
- I'd better go get some.
- Run.
I'll cover you.
Short delay.
Mrs. Tornnanis had a sixth-grade education, - and she could do this job.
- Uh-oh.
The Tater Tots are burning.
- Here.
- Thanks.
- What just happened?
- A little chilli, please.
Hello?
I know scooping is a difficult skill to master.
That's enough, Libby.
Get out of line.
- Whoa!
- Aah!
I am becoming more assertive.
Oh, no.
Mrs. Quick caught my magic.
Why is there a Seminole in full headdress in the neighbour's yard?
- Coincidence?
- Mm-hm.
Salem, you smell like chocolate.
Wha-- Uh We didn't have any cough drops, so I substituted bonbons.
You know, I'm gonna take your temperature again.
Yeah.
Let's see how you're doing.
Under the tongue.
Under the tongue.
No.
I want a more accurate reading this time.
Armpit?
Don't I get a vote in this?
Get me the SPCA.
Ow!
Man, Mrs. Quick was really forceful in there.
Really?
Do you think?
Frank.
Don't slouch.
That's better.
Oh, my spine.
I gotta call home.
Oh Where's the dial tone?
Boy, I tell you, if I had a dime for every quarter that phone took from me.
Salem's been faking it all along.
Let's bust him.
Now.
Or we could have some fun first.
That cat's gonna wish he was sick.
I'll get it.
- Hello?
Aunt Zelda?
Sabrina, I thought you were upstairs taking a nap.
You can punish me later.
I sneaked off to school.
My finger sneezed on Mrs. Quick, and she caught my magic.
What do I do?
First thing is hear me say you're in trouble.
And the next thing is get Mrs. Soon here quick.
I mean, get Mrs. Quick here soon.
How?
I can't trust my finger.
It's all stuffed up.
Then do it the mortal way, and drink fluids.
"Mortal way"?
Okay, I need a blindfold and a gun.
Well, Salem, your temperature is alarmingly high.
I'm really sick?
Yes, and that can only mean one thing: More attention and sympathy?
A nice cold bath.
What?
I'm feeling better.
I am not an animal!
- Mrs. Quick?
- Yes, Sabrina?
- I-- - No running, Doug.
- I'm feeling sick.
- Poor dear.
I was wondering if you could drive me home.
Excuse me, Mr. Kraft?
I'd like a word with you.
Fine.
If you must.
Ow!
Hot foot.
What's wrong with your finger?
I slammed it in a car door.
It'll be fine.
I'll be in the cafeteria.
Dear, you should see the nurse about your stomach, and perhaps some sort of surgeon about your finger.
Oh, but-- Mr. Kraft.
You have no right to make the students work during lunch.
Do you think I am doing this just to make the students angry?
That's just a delightful bonus.
I am doing this to appease the school board, which is something that we administrators do.
Oh You You-- You're nothing but the school board's trained chimp.
Oh, dear.
I'm freaking out.
I thought I was being confident.
But it turns out I'm just insane.
Think, Sabrina.
Think.
Uh To hide from conflict and clashes What we need Are rose-coloured glasses  MRS.
--just like the doctor told me to.
Well What am I going to do?
Mr. Kraft is a chimp.
And the world seems altered somehow.
And I'm sure everything will turn out just fine.
Now all I have to do is get home a kidnapped teacher and a chimp.
Let's do it.
Come, Mr. Kraft.
Sabrina, your finger is dripping.
How fun.
Can we hurry?
There's one thing in my room Mr. Kraft hasn't destroyed.
Never mind.
Okay.
Dr. Brickman is expecting us.
Now, he's the foremost authority on fractures.
But he's not half bad at stuff like this.
And he can take a look at that finger, but until then, could you put it somewhere?
We're going to a doctor?
Oh, good.
I'm due for a checkup.
MRS.
Whee!
I'm beginning to think I should have worn mittens.
Sabrina Spellman, the doctor will see you now.
I'm finished with this if you'd like to eat it.
Now, there's something you should know about Dr. Brickman.
Hello.
I'm Dr. Brickman.
Let me guess, he has cold hands?
Don't worry.
He performed his first operation at 2.
I even supervised my own birth.
I'm a complete professional.
Patient's finger presents as distended and yucky.
Oh, shoot.
My insurance only covers "ooky," but not "yucky".
I'm gonna have to drain this.
This child is not coming anywhere near me with anything sharp.
Ooh, my eyes are a little tired.
Must be all the lovely excitement.
Mr. Kraft is a chimp.
Mr. Kraft is a chimp.
Just like Curious George.
Wow.
That does feel better.
I invented this device.
Yes.
And he named it the wicked cool drainy thing.
Now, I'm ready for the others.
Hmm.
Fascinating.
Mrs. Quick, I'm gonna ask you to point at Mr. Kraft and cough.
Fine by me.
Wait.
Shouldn't we get Mr. Kraft some rose-coloured glasses for when he's transformed?
I think we should use something more medically sound.
A lollipop?
Okay, it's second-opinion time.
No, it's a magical lollipop.
Anyone who sucks on it will instantly become a sucker who will believe anything we tell them.
It's a highly regarded scientific procedure.
And it comes in an assortment of fruit flavours.
Mrs. Quick, please proceed.
What's going on here?
Sabrin-- You're here because you're rescuing all these people on a secret mission for the FBI.
No kidding.
Hey, this is fun.
President Clinton went on TV and said you're a big, fat stupid head.
- And that's why I'm a Republican.
- Okay.
That's enough.
What do we do next, doctor?
First of all, get back to where the spell originally took place.
Then put these in their ears and turn it counterclockwise.
It'll erase their memory of the spell.
And what will erase my memory of having to do that?
Mrs. Quick, I'm gonna stick this swab in your ear, if you don't mind.
Oh, I'm sure nothing but good will come of it.
Mr. Kraft, I'm gonna have to stick one in your ear too.
- Why?
- Because when I do, it will take years off your life and make you a famous song-and-dance man.
Oh, really?
Oh, well, then swab away.
Sabrina.
What's going on here?
Gross, gross, gross.
"The school board's trained chimp"?
Do you realise what you are saying and who you are saying it too?
Well, I-- - Oh, she's lost all her confidence.
- I mean, yes, I do.
You're their little monkey.
You just do what they want you to do, even though deep down you think it's wrong.
You know, I used to respect you.
Well Hey, you really know how to hit a guy's sore spot, don't you?
You'll never teach the students values by exploiting them.
Okay.
So we agree to disagree.
And maybe I will hire a new lunch lady.
- Yes.
- But the students will have to keep working their shifts until I do.
You got it?
Oh Grr And that includes football players and cheerleaders.
Not in this universe.
Football players and cheerleaders.
Okay.
Jeez, how do you really feel about it?
- Hey.
- Hey.
So I'm a little concerned about my newfound confidence.
It seems to be limited to getting me more Tater Tots.
Yeah, but I really appreciate it.
Valerie, I learned that if you think you are confident, you are confident.
And I learned that childhood traumas don't go away by reading a book.
Hey, hey, mister!
Oh, no.
I've created a monster.
You could fall and really hurt yourself, dear.
Come on, let's go get you some cocoa.
I want to be just like her.
All except for the low teacher's salary part.
Here comes the floor show.
It's time to wake up from my nightmare.
Ow.
Time to wake up from my nightmare.
Ow.
Time to wake up from my nightmare.
Oh, yep.
These glands are definitely swollen.
- Doesn't that usually require surgery?
- Mm-hm.
Sur-- I'm faking it.
I faked the whole thing.
- What?
- How could you?
I just wanted a little attention.
Is that so wrong?
Yes.
Salem, I hope you've learned your lesson.
It's wrong for a cat to cry wolf.
- I'll never do it again!
- Okay.
And I still have that knot, you know.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Salem, you're drinking like a dog.
I just started a new exercise programme, and I need to replenish my fluids.
Then, I'm gonna get to the exercise part.
If that's a new fashion statement, I'd rethink it.
Mark the date.
I've just invented the first portable x-ray helmet.
Take a look.
Uhn.
Can it detect internal bleeding?
It's a work in progress.
Hey, who ate all the Wheat-ios?
Did you know Addis Ababa is the capital of Ethiopia?
Not that I'm trying to change the subject.
Let's try a cat scan.
Salem, you even ate the prize.
Did someone order a Scotch?
Ha-ha-ha.
- What are you doing?
- Scanning the mailman.
I wouldn't have picked him for a boxer man.
Check to see if he's got my Muscle & Fitness magazine.
I wanna read the interview with Joe Piscopo.
That's Harvey.
Quick witch check.
I'll take this.
You take that.
No problem, honey.
Is there anything that I can get rid of?
- You?
- Gotcha.
- Hey, Harvey.
- Hey.
I brought our Social Studies project.
- Great, did you get much done?
- Yeah.
I bought the poster board.
Okay, well, we have all day to work on it.
So, what would be a good transportation system - for the town of Westbridge?
- Hmm.
- So did you finish your project?
- No.
- Did you start your project?
- No.
Sabrina, you've really gotta stop procrastinating.
We weren't procrastinating.
Harvey and I just got busy doing other more fun things.
We rotated every mattress in the house.
Sabrina, procrastination only makes things worse.
Ask Hilda about the time-- Well, ask Hilda about any time.
I'll think of a comeback for her tomorrow.
- I just wish I could get motivated.
- Three words: magical jumping beans.
One word: Huh?
No, come on.
They really make you hop to.
Beans, beans, the magical fruit.
Oh, grow up.
This sounds easy.
"Potassium benzoate, a shot of B12, and fruit extract".
And we just happen to be out of potassium benzoate, - a shot of B12, and fruit extract.
- You'll have to go to the Piggly Wiggly in the Other Realm.
They have everything.
I can't stand that place.
Pigs aren't very good at making change.
Who are they kidding with that sneezeguard over the slop bar?
Well, I'm on my way.
Sabrina, Valerie's on the phone!
Just as soon as I talk to Valerie.
Val, I don't believe in shampoo-conditioners in one.
What you gain in time you lose in body.
Look at that.
Zelda got invited to Amy Kahn's wedding and I didn't.
I forgot to put in an alarm system.
No, there's not a car in my kitchen.
If Libby says that to you again, you look her in the eye, and you say-- My beans!
No, I mean, I gotta go to the store.
I'll call you later.
The store's closed by now.
- What?
Why didn't you tell me?
- Don't blame me.
I wasn't the one procrastinating by talking on the phone.
Eavesdropping was at the top of my to-do list.
I've gotta work on my project.
I need those magical jumping beans.
I'll just substitute the ingredients.
Perfect.
I knew corn would work as well as phosphoric acid.
"Hold beans in hand, shake vigorously, and you'll feel instantly energetic".
Come on.
Ugh.
These beans are lame.
Oh, and they melt in your hands.
I should take this out to the kerb.
No, I'll do it tomorrow.
- Going to bed, Salem?
- In a minute.
I'm having a staring contest with the cat across the street.
Ha-ha!
I won!
In your face, Fluffy!
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Earthquake!
- But we're in Massachusetts.
- Well, then, what is it?
- Is that a beanstalk?
Beanstalk!
Oh, no!
Now where are we gonna plant our bulbs?
Did someone throw out some magic beans?
I threw out some magical jumping beans.
But it doesn't say anything about beanstalks.
Did you follow the recipe carefully?
Sure.
With a few substitutions.
Well, what were they?
Maybe we could just reverse the spell.
Well, extract of something, some other gobbledegook.
And tapioca.
- I was gonna write it down, but-- - See, Sabrina?
Procrastination only makes things worse.
Then you and I have to listen to Zelda.
She cannot resist-- Can we please focus on hiding the 300-foot beanstalk?
Fog?
I bet you guys did stuff like this all the time when you were my age, huh?
No, never.
Next, we have to figure out what to do about the giant.
Right.
That's what I-- Giant?
There's actually a giant at the top of the beanstalk?
- Or worse.
- Beanstalks always lead - to a bad neighbourhood.
- Here's a thought.
We don't go up.
It's not what doesn't go up there.
It's what might come down.
Exactly.
So we need someone to go up the beanstalk and stand guard.
- I vote Salem.
- I'm scared of heights.
You're a cat.
Mean.
Does the Other Realm have tree trimmers or something that might help?
Tree trimmers.
Isn't she cute?
If only it were that simple.
This is a magical beanstalk, Sabrina.
It's going to take a lot more than tree trimmers.
Hey, what about that plutonium-based root killer?
Oh, it didn't make a dent in the dandelions.
Hello.
This is your guard.
Harvey's at the front door, and send me a sandwich.
Oh, no.
Harvey's here to work on our project.
Hey.
Have you guys seen all the fog?
- It's cool.
- Thank you.
Wow, is this one of those virtual-reality games?
Sure.
That's a good explanation.
- Can I try it?
- No.
Because we need to go get something to eat before we work.
I had three chilidogs for breakfast, but sure.
Can we please not leave that thing lying around?
You're worried about a helmet, and Harvey's about to walk - into a kitchen with a beanstalk?
- Good point.
- Oh, boy, jellybeans.
- Harvey, don't look at the-- No, don't eat those!
I really meant to put these away.
Harvey!
Salem!
- Salem, did you see Harvey?
- No!
I was too busy looking for that sandwich.
Oh, where is he?
Harvey!
Harvey!
Sabrina?
Sabrina.
- Aunt Hilda, Aunt Zelda!
- Honey, what's wrong?
Harvey thought the beans were jellybeans.
He ate them and flew out the door and up the beanstalk.
He's gonna suspect something.
Okay, first things first.
Let's see if we can see him.
Since when do we have a periscope in the kitchen?
You've lived here two years, you never noticed it?
Teenagers.
Let me look.
- Oh, good.
It's not a giant.
- Let me look.
- Oh!
It's worse.
It's the Wicked Witch.
- Oh!
Wicked?
But she's so pretty.
Oh, she's had a lot of work done.
And worst of all, she feasts on mortals.
- That's horrible.
- Hence the "wicked" part - of Wicked Witch.
- I've gotta get up and save Harvey.
Sabrina, wait.
You're not used to the high altitude.
It could knock out your powers.
You'll be no match for her.
But it's almost noon.
What if she wants a Harvey melt?
Don't worry, we'll have time.
She always fattens them up first.
Sabrina, here's the new plan.
You wait here and keep an eye on Harvey through the periscope.
- Hilda and I will go to the YMCA.
- This is no time to go to the gym.
No, it stands for Yikes!
Magic Crisis Agency.
They specialise in these sorts of problems.
We'll be back in a flash.
I'm sure the line will move quickly.
Excuse me, ma'am.
How long have you been waiting?
My oldest boy, Tom, is 52.
That's nice, but how long have you been here?
He was born in this line.
What's taking them so long?
Nice to meet you, Harvey.
I'm the Wick-- Woman of the house.
Do you know where you are?
Well, last thing I remember, I was eating some jellybeans, and then suddenly I was swept up into the air.
Oh, I must've died.
But I had so much to give, so much to do.
I was supposed to mow the lawn.
It's okay, Harvey.
It's okay.
- Are we in heaven?
- Let's just call it a weigh station to heaven.
On the scale, on the scale.
You see, Harvey, the big guy upstairs doesn't trust skinny people.
Or the French.
I don't know why.
Hmm.
"Alarmingly svelte"?
Oh, this will never do.
Here, eat this stick of butter while I think of something.
That's it.
I can't wait any longer.
Peach pie, my favourite.
How did I know?
And now for a little sprinkle of my secret ingredient.
Save room for dessert.
As the official watchcat, I order you to get down.
I'm going up, and don't try to stop me, cat.
You leave me with no choice than to go with you and protect you.
- You're afraid of heights.
- Right.
Then you leave me no choice than to wish you well.
SALEM : Pull it together.
Be a man, Saberhagen.
Climb, climb.
I hope we don't get caught up in all that red tape.
I made it.
Good thing that pilot knew how to swerve.
Harvey.
Anyone with a friend or a family member up to their neck in quicksand, come to the head of the line.
Hey!
We've been waiting for hours.
We have a boy in a beanstalk about to be eaten by the Wicked Witch.
I'll get to that.
Wait.
I need a plan.
Got it.
Nothing wrong with my magic.
Yes?
Hello, I'm with the Confectionery Construction Company.
We specialise in gingerbread siding.
I don't know.
The sugary smell really attracts the kids.
Mmm.
I do love children, especially with a bÃ©arnaise sauce.
Come in.
Allow me to demonstrate.
- Ooh.
- See how nicely it blends in with your decor?
Which, by the way, is lovely.
Oh, thank you.
It was designed by I.M. Pie.
Why don't you take a look at the sample book - while I take a few measurements.
- Hmm.
Is this one of those deals where you give me a great price on the gingerbread and then kill me on the frosting?
Our price includes all extras - and you could win a trip to Hawaii.
- Ooh.
- Harvey?
- Sabrina.
Oh, no, you ate a bad bean and died too?
- What are the odds of that?
- Harvey, you're not dead, but you will be if we don't get you out.
But I haven't touched the stuffed pork chops.
Harvey, listen, that woman out there is wicked.
You wouldn't say that if you had her pralines.
- She's an awesome cook.
- She's gonna cook you.
- See?
- "Monday, Hansel.
Tuesday, Gretel.
Wednesday, Harv--" "Harvey"?
Let's get out of here.
Does this sweater make me look fat?
Oh, I see you two have met.
He is so cute, I could just eat him up with a spoon.
Heh.
Now, I wanted to ask you the price of the candy-cane rain gutters.
I just put some on the house.
Why don't you look before you decide?
She is so efficient.
I'm going to put in a good word to your supervisor.
Don't forget the Ã©clairs.
- Go, go, go!
- Oh, my thighs are rubbing.
I know this isn't the time to ask, but what the heck is happening?
Fee, fi, fo, fum, I smell a half mortal.
So have you decided on those gutters?
Make yourselves at home.
We dress for dinner here.
In your case that means oyster dressing.
Heh.
Don't look down.
One branch at a time.
Oh, a blue jay.
Eat up, kids.
I can only see one chin.
Oh, I forgot.
I have ladyfingers in the oven.
Keep an eye on the door.
I'm gonna try to pick the lock.
Got it.
Oh!
It must be the high altitude.
My powers are knocked out.
Why are my aunts always right?
Harvey!
Quick, we've gotta eat through this gingerbread wall.
- I'm kind of full.
- Just eat!
What are you doing?
Nothing.
Why, you pesky little entrÃ©es.
If you keep trying to escape, I'll just have to move up my dinner party.
Lift up your arm, please.
Meat thermometer.
You know, in her defence, the peach pie was good.
We're finally getting somewhere.
Uh-oh.
You're in the line for family members encased in stone.
You've got a beanstalk problem.
That's Window C. No.
Window C told us to come here.
Well, then you need Window E. That's the window for people Window C incorrectly told to go to Window B. Next, please!
Where is the window for people who pull people through windows?
Oh, no!
I'm out of mushrooms.
You can't make a decent gravy without mushrooms.
Harvey and I'd be happy to go to the store and pick some up for you.
Nice try.
Store's closed.
I'll just have to serve you dry.
Or you could put it off until tomorrow.
By then we'll be nice and tender.
- Undercooked Kinkle can be gristly.
- Yeah, and think about it.
What we'll taste like when we're smothered in a nice mushroom gravy.
Hmm.
And there's a wonderful tart that goes great with teenager.
The recipe's in that magazine.
Sounds delicious.
Save a piece of my leg for me.
I have been wanting to catch up on my cooking journals.
What the hey.
I'll eat you tomorrow.
Soon as I say so, we make a break for it.
Silly me, I almost forgot to keep you from getting away.
Not yet.
I gotta stop melting cheese and drinking it as a beverage.
I'm beginning to worry.
- We're starting to smell good.
- Shh!
Harvey, move over.
I need a clear shot at the door.
SoufflÃ©.
Didn't your mom ever teach you not to slam doors?
Sorry.
I don't like fast food!
Serpentine, Harvey!
Oh, for heaven's sakes.
I know what to do.
It didn't work.
She's not melting!
Get real, Harvey.
This isn't fantasy.
Now let's get off this cloud and down that beanstalk.
Now I've got you.
Nuh-uh.
Oh!
Whoa!
Finally.
I made it all the way up.
Go down, go down!
You gotta be kidding.
- You two are dead meat!
- Back off, lady.
It's the '90s.
Nobody eats mortals anymore.
And I'll have kitty for dessert.
Would you look at the time?
Huh-huh.
Huh-huh-huh!
I hope you land on your feet!
Ooh!
I'm alive!
Now where's that sandwich?
Uh-huh.
So you've got a Code 937: mortal on a beanstalk with Wicked Witch.
Yes.
Are we in the right line?
- Yes, indeed.
- Oh!
You just need to get hold of a 329-K.
- What's that?
- Tree trimmer.
Look, Sabrina.
I'm sweating off all my weight.
That's great, Harvey.
Hey, look, there's Westbridge!
You know, we could really use a monorail down Main Street.
Yeah, we should remember that for our report!
Hey, my power's back on.
WICKED  Get back here, you little Lean Cuisines!
Why didn't I eat you when I had the chance?
Because you procrastinated.
Take that!
No.
No!
She's turned me into a vegetarian!
- We made it.
- Yeah.
- Coming through.
- We've gotta save Harvey.
Harvey?
Sabrina, did you go up that beanstalk?
At least I didn't procrastinate.
Hey, you brought a tree trimmer?
He prefers to be called an arbourist.
Okay, let's get rid of this puppy.
Okay, everyone, stand clear.
Timber!
- Cool.
- Yeah, cool.
What's he gonna think when he comes to?
It's showtime.
Oh, no, the witch is gaining on us!
Harvey, you're really enjoying that virtual-reality game.
It was a game?
I knew that.
Didn't look that real.
Maybe we should work on our project.
Actually, I'd like to give this another try.
No, no more procrastinating.
Procrastinating is bad.
It only leads to terrible things.
- I will never procrastinate again.
- Good for you.
Wanna bake brownies and eat the dough?
That could be fun.
Another lesson well-learned.
What's that?
Has anyone seen Salem?
He hasn't come home for dinner.
Well, that's not like him.
Salem!
Here, kitty, kitty!
Oh, yeah, he hates that.
SALEM : I can't move.
Oh, no, is he hurt?
"Fatten Up"?
This must've fallen off the beanstalk.
Oh!
Salem, you didn't.
I did.
Well, don't just stand there.
Somebody get me a diet soda.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Sabrina, it's Valentine's Day.
You should definitely wear red to the dance.
Yeah, because no one else will have that idea.
Hey, there's Ken.
I'll bet he followed you here.
Stop it.
Hi, Ken.
Valerie.
What do you think?
Picture it with a Wonderbra.
He loves you.
Yeah, that was him asking me to marry him.
Hey, Val, you should get this dress for the dance.
That way you'll be ready if Let's see, who might ask you?
Kenny-poo?
This is a great dress.
- Look at the price.
Ouch.
- Oh, well.
My mom's plaid formal has a certain charm.
Oh!
Now, I didn't do that.
- Hey, Val.
You didn't see this tag.
- Wow, 20 percent off.
Hey, with a sale like this, I might be able to afford an even better dress.
Val, this one.
I-- I think it's a Presidents' Day sale, and all the other dresses are Canadian.
Do you like my wedding dress?
I'm on my way, Val, as soon as I find my red sweater.
I'm reading.
Yes, I've been listening to what you said.
Let me recap: "Ken, Ken, Ken".
See you.
Salem, my sweater.
Did you do this?
Hey, I was as shocked as you.
We have a major moth problem.
Oh.
By the way, Zelda and I are chaperoning the school dance Friday.
What?
Why don't you just hang a big "nerd girl" sign around my neck?
Okay.
Nobody likes a house where you can't speak figuratively.
Hello, Sabrina.
- Actually, I was here-- - My Aunt Hilda is right in there.
Oh, you dropped your "nerd girl" sign.
- Thanks.
- What can we do for you, Mr. Kraft?
Well, I heard you were chaperoning, so I thought I'd drop off the dance rules.
Okay, then.
Be careful driving home.
Our street tends to be slick.
You know, I will be at the dance myself, and I was just thinking, you know, if the kids are under control, and there's a slow dance-- You know, especially watch the dip at the bottom of the hill.
- I will.
Okay.
Very dangerous.
And thanks for the rules.
We'll make sure there's no-- Racketeering?
We have to get dates or you have to kill me.
Do you have any more money?
- We don't have enough for a tip.
- I think I'm wiped out.
Let me see.
There.
Fifty cents.
Think it's the thought that counts?
- Hi, Mrs. Popowski.
- Salinas.
Wow, two whole quarters.
Won't have to sweat the rent this month.
Emergency.
We just ran out of money, and for once, I'm actually being fun.
- We're tapped out.
- Oh.
Great.
Ken's leaving.
Hey, Val, we won some free ones.
I shall have to postpone my victory dance.
It's my lucky day.
Gotta call the mister.
It's steak tonight.
Where's my algebra book?
- Looking for this?
- Roland.
Give me that.
You're a finder, not a taker.
Not anymore.
I've changed careers.
I'm an equaliser.
By the way, you look lovely.
- A what?
- An equaliser.
You take from someone, I take from you.
It evens things out in the universe.
And this job has dental.
- What have I taken?
- Well, let's see.
You took 20 percent off a dress, I took 20 percent of your sweater.
You took pinball games, I took your algebra book.
- Sabrina, who is this gentleman?
- Roland, my cousin.
And who's this bozo?
Your new boyfriend?
Our vice principal.
Roland, perhaps you missed the sign stating that all visitors must report to the office before wandering aimlessly around the school grounds.
Are you implying that I can't read?
Sorry, he's hypoglycemic.
Nurse!
- I want my sweater fixed.
- Hey, Sabrina.
- Oh.
Look who it is.
Farm boy.
Isn't this your aunts' friend that I met last year?
If that's who I said he was.
Wanna make something of it, farm boy?
Not really.
I just wanted to tell Sabrina something about the dance on Friday.
Ooh.
Are we going to the dance together?
Mind if I throw up?
What I wanted to tell you was that-- I can't go to the dance.
I have to accompany my dad to a termite convention.
I can't believe I forgot about it.
I don't even remember hearing about it.
Okay, we're up to the Z's, and so far, every man we know is either married, busy or disgusting.
Several were all three.
What's wrong with you?
You've got a date for Valentine's Day.
Not anymore.
I'm being equalised.
Oh, please say you didn't take anyone's pet.
So I wasn't stealing, per se.
I was just trying to help Valerie.
We understand, but it was still wrong.
I took Belgium once to help Napoleon.
Big trouble.
What do I do?
I have to get rid of Roland.
He still wants to marry me.
You have to give back the things you took.
Okay, I'll just zap the dress into the store and some money into the pinball machine.
- Goodbye love-smitten equaliser.
- No, it's not that easy.
When you're equalising, you have to put forth more effort.
Basically, you have to give things back by hand.
Which is how I came to participate in a little thing called Waterloo.
Let me get this straight.
You felt so bad about the other night that you came all the way down here to give me money to give to the pinball-machine man.
- If you don't mind.
- No, of course not.
The pinball man is always running himself ragged bringing you kids extra napkins or refilling your free drinks.
No one works harder than the pinball-machine man.
Great.
So you don't mind.
Well, I think we should.
I'm against it.
That guy gives me the willies.
Fine, you're the one who wants a date.
You're right.
Okay, let's do it.
Love is special, love is alive Send me Cupid for 5.95 - You look awful.
- Hilda, it's his busy time of year.
Oh, that's not it.
I was just left at the altar.
My fiancÃ©e ran off with a policeman.
She never could resist a man in clothes.
- You wore that to get married?
- It was a formal wedding.
That's enough.
I'm getting out of the love business.
I think it's time to resign ourselves to the obvious.
We're not meant to have dates for this dance.
Maybe you can, but I can't, not with Willard Kraft and his Binaca breath.
I'll bet I can get him to snap out of it.
Come on, Cupie.
How much did you really like her?
Why?
There you go.
One debt erased.
Great, but I can't ask Valerie to return the dress.
She loves it too much.
- You could sew a duplicate.
- Sew?
I can't even staple correctly.
Sewing's easy.
I just sewed a bed skirt last weekend.
Do your aunts have a sewing room?
In the dungeon, next to the bomb shelter.
A spinning wheel?
What, a loom is too high tech?
I can't do this.
All witches can spin.
Just sit down and give it a whirl, so to speak.
Why do I have the feeling you're gonna tell me your real name is Rumpelstiltskin?
This will make you believe in love again.
"What can you say about a 25-year-old girl who died"?
Good riddance.
Hello?
Hi, Valerie.
I'll call Sabrina.
Sabrina.
She's in the dungeon with Roland.
In the dungeon?
Yeah.
- Is there any leftover pie?
- Valerie, she'll call you back.
- Hey.
- Yes, there's pie.
This is great.
I think I may have found my old-age hobby.
Wow, I never noticed how inviting this spinning-wheel spindle is.
- Do you think it would prick me?
- No.
Give it a try.
And this is my lovely bride.
Ooh.
Touch it.
Touch it.
Roland.
Stop.
How dare you try to prick Sabrina's finger on that spindle so you could run off with her?
What?
I was only gonna keep her for a century or two.
- What?
- You know very well that Sleeping Beauty spells are illegal ever since, well, Sleeping Beauty.
Hold it.
Roland, I thought we settled this last time.
- I'm not interested in marrying you.
- Dating?
Fine.
But we're still not square.
See, how she lays her hand upon her cheek!
Ken just found out he got the part of Romeo in the school play.
- How can you tell?
- He's so much fun.
- I wish he'd ask me to the dance.
- Why don't you ask him?
Because if he doesn't ask me, I can always assume that it slipped his mind.
But if I ask him and he says no, no amount of delusion will fix it.
Tell you what.
Why don't I feel him out for you?
As long as you're willing to lie about anything negative.
Absolutely.
- Hi, Ken.
- Sabrina.
What light through yonder window breaks?
Explosion in the chem.
lab?
I was just wondering if you were taking anyone to the dance on Friday.
Why, Sabrina, I'd lovest to go.
- Thou hast stolen my heart.
- No-- Valerie.
Valerie.
- Stole a mortal's heart, eh?
- No, he was just goofing.
Sabrina, you took his heart, I'm taking yours.
Still need that hall pass, mister.
And now your heart belongs to me.
Sabrina.
Are you going to the dance with Ken?
Wait for me, my darling.
Okay.
You can look.
I love it.
Well, it's not as big as a castle, but I just feel more at home under a bridge.
What's that sound?
Oh, that's just the billy goats crossing.
You'll get used to it.
It's like living near an airport.
Who's this?
That's just my old girlfriend, Thumbelina.
Well, the picture has to go.
- You're all mine now.
- Yes, ma'am.
So, what do you wanna do?
- Gaze lovingly into your eyes.
- Okay.
Oh, come on.
You've gotta cheer up.
I mean, I need a date, and I need a date.
So how goes it with diaper dan?
Well, it's more challenging than building the Panama Canal, but then, less malaria.
Look.
- What?
You're fighting a yawn?
- A smile.
You told a joke and it made me smile.
I've seen bigger on a Lutheran.
I can't believe it.
I thought I'd never smile again.
You're cured.
Hallelujah.
Now, there's the most adorable fireman down the street.
And I owe it all to you, Hilda.
- My Hilda.
- Uh-oh.
I'll get it.
- Hello, Hilda.
- Oh, great.
One more gentleman caller, and we can put on The Glass Menagerie.
- Who's he?
- Who's he?
I am someone who has the decency not to wear a diaper in front of a lady.
- What?
Why, you-- - Come on, just--  What on Earth?
Get your hands off her.
Willard, what do you want?
Well, I came to speak to you about your niece's strange behaviour in school with her cousin.
- Cousin?
Roland.
- Cousin?
Roland.
I have a bad feeling about this.
I'm gonna call Valerie.
I'll help her.
- Afraid to show your legs?
- Nice perm.
She's not at Valerie's.
- The Other Realm.
- Let's go.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
- You, go.
- You, come.
But why does he get to?
Oh, man.
- Why did you bring him along?
- So we could use the car-pool lane.
I made you a personal pan pizza.
Is there anything else I could do to make you ecstatically happy?
Pepper flakes?
Wait up, Hildie.
Go away.
Maybe we should have ditched him at Stuckey's.
That sounds like my aunts.
Aunt Zelda.
Aunt Hilda.
- Cupid?
- He's in love with me.
Ignore him.
- We're here to rescue you.
- Rescue me?
But I love it here.
I love this mouldy home.
I love Roland.
Okay, what have you done to her?
I think I know, sweetie.
I am in the love biz.
He's taken her heart.
It was a fair deal.
She stole a boy's heart, I took hers.
You are not allowed to equalise for your own benefit.
- Give it back now.
- No, I don't want it back.
I want my Roly to keep it forever and ever.
Did you also give her a saccharine pill?
Sabrina has spoken.
Now, if you'll excuse us, the ogre and his lady friend are coming over for dinner.
And there's not enough entrails for everyone.
That's right.
- Hilda, love of my life.
- Oh, no, not another one.
- Roland.
- Sabrina, the other love of my life.
Help me.
I love you.
But I still love you.
Why did you hit me with that arrow?
So that you would see that it's wrong to mess with people's hearts.
Unless you're a licensed professional.
Give Sabrina's heart back.
Now.
I will if you'll grant me one favour.
It better not involve me and a trip to Make-Out Point.
I will grant you one request within reason.
- But first, the heart.
- No, I don't care if he does love Hilda.
I still want Roland-- Away from me.
Yuck.
I can't believe I was eating soup out of a sheep's stomach.
- Are you sure you don't wanna stay?
- Very sure.
But if I change my mind about living in hell with a man I can't stand, I'll let you know.
I'm out of here.
How about you?
Not if you were the last troll living under a bridge on Earth.
Don't worry.
It was only a cheapo infatuation arrow.
- It will wear off by sundown.
- Good.
My feelings, however, are the real thing.
Now, Roland, what is your request?
Granted.
Can't believe Aunt Zelda granted your wish to come to one dance with me.
- You want me to spin you again?
- No.
I'm still mad at you for taking Harvey away.
Boy, you really know how to hold a grudge.
I'm gonna go request another disco song so we can bump.
- So how's your date working out?
- Okay.
He's not so bad once you put pants on him.
Yeah.
But maybe he should have taken the diaper off first.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Listen, Val, I didn't-- - Sabrina, I'm not mad at you.
It's not your fault Ken doesn't like me.
And believe it or not, I don't think it's my fault.
Good for you.
Hey, if you wanna dance, I'll share Roland.
In fact, I'll give you 5 bucks to take him off my hands.
- Great.
There's Ken.
- How did you spot him?
Miss Birkhead, this is a social event.
It is not a place for conversation.
Will you stop that?
I know these are practical, but, darn it, fashion means something to me.
Mind if I borrow your date?
Okay, but bring him back if there's a slow song.
I don't wanna look like a loser.
- Okay, see that girl over there?
- Yeah.
Okay, I want you to work your magic to make him attracted to her.
Oh, shoot, you didn't bring your arrows.
Hilda wouldn't let me.
Never fear.
I brought a peashooter and love peas.
Can't do it.
It would be a waste of a pea.
You mean there's no hope for those two?
No, there's no need.
That boy is already crazy about that girl.
- He's just shy.
- Ken, shy?
Well, some people cover up shyness with bravado.
Well, the job requires a certain amount of psychology.
Well, if it's true that Ken likes Val, then maybe there's a little something I can do.
Wanna dance?
I'd love to.
I've been wishing you'd ask.
Miss Birkhead, that punch will not serve itself.
Thanks.
Excuse us.
Would you give Zelda a little evening's affection?
Look, I don't wanna be working all night.
But for you, okay.
- Oh, dear Lord.
- Two birds with one stone.
Zelda's happy, and that goob is no longer fishing in my creek.
Gross to what you just said, and gross to what you just did.
- May I have this dance?
- Oh, yes.
- The deal was one dance.
- I know.
I want to apologise.
I was wrong to try and steal your heart through magic.
I just wanted you to like me.
That was nice.
Roland, I like it when you're nice.
- So we're engaged?
- No.
Look, I wanna equalise what I did to you.
You're gonna set up a large trust fund?
No.
Harvey.
I can't believe I thought I had to go to a father-son termite convention.
According to my dad, there is no such thing.
Well, now that you're here, you wanna dance?
You bet.
Thumby?
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Hilda's still not back from her audition?
No.
That's Spanish for "no".
Well, I hope she got the job.
It's so hard for her to find a place to play around here.
Yeah, her musical talent is a wonderful gift.
And she needs to bore other people with it.
Let's face it.
Classical music isn't the gravy train it used to be.
It's not like the golden age.
Vienna in the 1700s.
In those days there were more orchestras than consumption wards.
And you were never ostracized for eating a dead rat in public.
Aunt Hilda's so talented, I'm sure she got this job.
And she has a very strange way of celebrating.
Should I get my ears pierced?
Hey, guess what.
The school's having a battle of the bands.
- And I signed us up.
- I didn't know we were a band.
Every group had to start somewhere.
Usually in a garage.
We can leapfrog that and start in the gym.
What do you say?
We could have cool outfits.
- We could work on dance moves.
- Put together a light show.
- I always wanted to be in a band.
- Me too.
We're in.
- Great.
- So does anyone here actually know how to play an instrument?
- I'm so close.
- Why don't you drop cold fusion and work on an ink that doesn't stain your fingers?
All I need is a formula patented by Dr. Terdlington.
Which means I would have to call him and ask for permission.
Oh, no.
Isn't he that guy you had to compete with for the Other Realm research grant?
Exactly.
Zelda Spellman made a strong impression with her paper "Polymers: More Uses Than You Think".
But the winner is Dr. Clark Terdlington.
It's been an unbearably long evening of dull speeches, so I'll make this brief.
I'm better than you.
It was so unlike me, but I just couldn't stand his arrogance.
And now it turns out I need that sanctimonious blowhard.
Oh, just call him.
Tell him that you changed your medication and that you're feeling better.
That always works for me.
- Wish me luck.
- Another classical audition?
Sort of.
Okay, you got the job.
You're our new strolling fiddler.
Was it my Beethoven?
It's just that you fit into the costume.
Sabrina!
Oh, thank goodness.
No one was injured.
- How do we sound?
- Stay in school.
Well, if it isn't the Electric Freak Orchestra.
And by the way, the cheerleaders have a band, and we're gonna win.
- She doesn't know that.
Yes, I do.
Cheerleaders always win.
And geeks always lose.
I believe they call that the natural order.
I do not want to lose to Libby.
We have to get good, and we have to get good soon.
We're not good?
Dr. Terdlington, that is so kind of you.
Of course you're aware that it's kind.
I'll see you soon.
That pompous swine might let me use his formula.
I'm gonna be able to give the world cold fusion.
Super.
What does it mean?
May I play something for you gentlemen?
Perhaps some Chopin, Mozart?
If one of them wrote "Turkey in the Straw".
It was kind of hard to hear, but we suck, right?
And that was with gym echo.
I hope someone brought some baking soda, because something stinks in here.
Oh.
Look.
It's Sabrina's band.
I'd think of a snappy comeback, but it's true.
Okay.
Hit it.
There's a little bit of me in you A little bit in everything you do You still stuck on that whole "us winning" thing?
Come on.
It's not so bad.
I mean, the only difference between us and them is they're talented.
Makes you wonder if Hitler was actually a good painter.
Libby insults you because she's jealous.
I don't think so.
Is there a spell that can make dogs howl every time she opens her mouth?
You have to be careful how you treat people.
Even rotten people.
You might regret it one day.
Dr. Terdlington.
I believe this whoopee cushion is yours.
For instance, today.
And I thought giving Henry VIII a sponge bath was the low point of my life.
I had no idea you could bottle talent.
Where do you think that expression comes from?
A six-pack of refreshing talent, now with the handy twist-top.
Cool.
But I won't use it unless it's absolutely necessary.
Hey, I don't care how you justify it.
Promise you won't tell Aunt Hilda or Zelda?
Mum's the word.
Howdy, y'all.
Hi.
So how'd the gig go?
Lousy.
I tried to merge the worlds of art and prime rib, but I failed.
Well, the important part is that you tried.
Gotta go.
I'm glad Zelda left the labtop open.
Think I'll whip up some seasonings to make those Philistines at the steak house appreciate good music.
Not a peep out of you.
Mum's the word.
Ooh.
DÃ©jÃ  vu.
Excuse me!
Excuse m-- Put a sock in it!
Thank you.
Now, I understand that everyone has been informed that I am judging the band contest tonight.
- Yes.
- Okay, so no talent isn't the only thing against us.
Well, that information is incorrect.
For me to judge the contest would be unfair.
Now you've lost me.
The contest will be judged by the producer of Rock and a Hard Place Westbridge's only cable TV showcase for local bands.
- Dwayne Kraft.
- Kraft?
Yes, Dwayne Kraft.
My nephew.
Thank you so much for reconsidering and giving me a chance to plead my case, Dr. Terdlington.
And apologise.
Mostly I just want you to apologise.
LIBBY : Fits together perfectly  The Libby Chessler Generation!
Maybe we should've taken lessons.
Come on, you guys, we can do it.
Follow that, Freaka McEntire.
It's necessary.
Well, I'm thirsty.
How about you guys?
Want a drink?
- No, thanks.
I'm full.
- And I'm prone to gastritis.
Come on.
I need the money on the empties.
Okay, it's only fair that I let the final band compete, Although the expression "just a formality" certainly comes to mind.
Please welcome Entry Number 5.
- We forgot to come up with a name.
- Just play.
Two, three, four   One way One way or another I'm gonna find you I'm gonna getcha, getcha Getcha, getcha One way or another I'm gonna win you I'm gonna getcha, getcha Getcha, getcha One way or another I'm gonna see you I wanna meetcha, meetcha Meetcha, meetcha One day maybe next week I'm gonna meetcha I'm gonna meetcha, I'll meetcha I will Drive past your house And if The lights are all down I'll see who's around One way or another I'm gonna getcha, I'll getcha I'll getcha, getcha, getcha, getcha One way or another Okay, fine.
Fine.
Do we have a winner here, judge?
The best band in this battle is Entry Number 5!
Hello, Westbridge.
Are you ready to rock 'n' roll?
Listen.
I'd love to send a crew over here, tape you guys for my show.
Yeah!
Well, let me talk it over with my band.
- Okay, we'll do it.
- All right.
Aunt Zelda, we won.
You should've seen the look on Libby's face.
Shock and disbelief really become her.
I hope you remembered what I said about being mean to people.
Zelda.
Have you decided to forgive me yet?
Not yet.
Another one might help.
So close.
It's a great-- Sabrina, I wrote a song for our TV debut, but the drummer has a problem with it.
Take a look at it.
Valerie, you wrote a song called "My Valerie"?
Wait till you see what he wants to do.
I drew up some ideas for a complete new look for the band.
That's you and Val.
Why are we dressed like worms?
They're brown unitards.
It's a comment on an asexual society.
And I'm the universal love being, signified by the goat ears and the sleeveless spandex vestments.
- "Love being"?
- Yeah, but we can't sing about me.
- I'm trying to change America.
- Oh, yeah?
Hold it.
Why are we fighting?
We're friends.
Because he has a stupid idea.
Oh, yeah.
I am not gonna perform dressed like a bug.
- This is my band.
- Your band?
Lady, we don't need no pepper.
Oh, no, this is classical seasoning.
It adds taste.
How come you ain't playing that "Turkey in the Straw" I asked for?
You know what would be simply marvellous?
Yes, some incredibly obscure Wagner.
If you insist.
"Valerie, my Valerie, foxy little junior walking down the street.
Valerie, my Valerie--" Would you be terribly upset if I threw up in one of your shoes?
Salem, what am I gonna do?
Well, you've always been able to talk things out with Harvey.
- Hello.
- Hey, Harvey, it's Sabrina.
Hey.
So you gonna wear the brown suit?
- Uh, no.
Listen-- - Hold on.
He put me on hold.
Since when does Harvey have Muzak?
Hey.
Sorry about that.
I didn't know so many chicks had my home number.
- You're listed.
- Hold on.
Hey, sweetness.
Let me dump Sabrina, and I'll be right back-- That's okay, goat boy, I'll dump you.
I wish I'd never given them a swig of talent.
It's ruining our friendship, and I can't even enjoy winning.
Perhaps you're feeling bad because Libby sang with genuine talent and deserved to win.
Don't hit me.
Great, now I feel annoyed and guilty.
If you want your friendships back, maybe you should take the fizz out of the egos you inflated.
- I wish I could.
- You can.
They take a sip of flat talent, they go flat too.
Great.
So I'll just let these go flat, and when I see Harvey and Valerie tonight, they'll drink, and we'll go back to being talentless friends.
Did you pop one for yourself?
Me?
I haven't been affected by having things go my way.
Oh, please.
Little Miss "I'm Too Cool To Do My History Homework".
I had an autograph signing.
Okay.
Libby, are you here for the show?
Please.
I have a date tonight, and I left my sweater here.
I go to the carnival when I want to see sideshow oddities.
Maybe these won't be necessary.
Maybe Harvey and Val will show up and be their old selves.
Please.
Don't they have roadies to do that?
- Drink?
- No, thanks.
I asked for clear soda.
And I don't see the blackened-tuna papaya hummus we demanded.
Don't they know who we are?
Come on.
Let's split one.
They're good.
We'll grab some eats, and I'll tell the others about you joining the band.
- What?
- What?
Hi.
Sabrina, Valerie, I'd like you to meet Sunset.
You can't just bring someone into the band.
Especially someone named Sunset.
You said.
Listen, I'm the rhythm section, and I say-- - Oh, excuse me, drummer boy.
- Guys, let's just have a drink.
- Here's your four-alarm hummus.
- Finally!
Sorry.
Sunset says I should only have water before a performance.
Hey.
Sabrina.
I just want to tell you I think you guys have what it takes to go statewide.
- Really?
- Oh.
Big bucks to be made.
Wow.
With a lot of money, we could help a lot of people.
You could buy a lot of stuff.
Yeah.
They could always lose their talent later.
- Beg your pardon.
- Nothing.
Let me just talk it over with Harvey and Val.
That's funny.
I can't remember how to hold a guitar.
So long, lot of stuff.
Beg your pardon?
A woman of my standing enjoys caviar and fine wines.
I could not have ordered "rootin' tootin' beans".
You did, Lorlene.
And you threw in a, "Hee-haw"!
Beans, caviar, it all goes well with Rimski-Korsakov.
All right, let's get some sound levels.
All right, whenever you're ready.
Well, I see you guys took that bad-rehearsal, great-show thing to heart, huh?
I'm sorry, Mr. Kraft.
I guess the other day was just a fluke.
- We'll just go.
- No.
You just listen up, young lady.
Dwayne put his butt on the line for this remote.
Well, remind me to thank him.
And when Dwayne puts his butt on the line, his mother gets testy.
His mother, who is my sister and the owner of the house where I am currently a guest.
Where I am intent on staying a guest.
Got it?
When did we get bad again?
I can't suck on TV.
You'd think I'd be good at humiliation.
It's just another thing I failed to master.
Harvey, you go help Valerie remember how to hold a guitar, and I'll try to figure something out.
Could you get rid of Sunset?
She scares me.
If only I could really sing.
If only someone could really sing.
Libby can sing.
Wait, is that really better than embarrassing myself all over TV?
Let's go with yes.
I was just in the girls' bathroom.
What am I doing here?
Isn't it weird, you're doing something, you're mind is somewhere else, and bam, you're in a gym and you're asking, "How did I get here"?
- How did I get here?
- My point exactly.
But since you stopped by, I need a little favour.
Hello.
You don't know me, but I just wanted to say, Dr. Terdlington is a hero, Zelda Spellman is a zero.
Now on to the B's.
That's it.
I am through apologising.
Either you give me the formula, or you go.
You know, Zelda, I've always liked you.
You-- What?
Well, the science biz is so full of phoneys, but I like your fire.
Well, actually, I've always admired you.
Not your personality, but your mind.
Dinner?
Love to.
And you want me to sing for you?
In exchange for eternal gratitude, endless flattery, and a piece of the merchandising.
- I'll do it.
- You will?
But let's get one thing straight.
It's only because I love to sing.
And we love to hear you sing, because you sing so very, very well.
And you're pretty too.
Let's change "endless flattery" to cash.
Send this ghastly smear back to the galley and give the chef 30 lashes for his crimes against eating!
I'll never dine in this establishment again!
I'm appalled!
Perhaps a little Vivaldi?
You know, it's funny.
Without customers, we don't need a fiddler.
You're fired, Hilda.
Fine.
I'm keeping the dress.
There's a little bit of me in you A little bit in everything you do There's a little bit in you It goes a long way deep into you There's a little bit of you in me A little bit of you in everything I feel Makes us fit together Perfectly Cut.
Hey, Libby, you were great.
Well, good save.
Suspicious, but good.
Amazing how things worked out.
Yep.
The winner won as the freaks looked on in amazement.
All's right with the world.
Well, I happen to believe that if a waiter wants that 9 percent tip, everything has to be perfect.
- You are terrible.
- Yes.
Well, it's late.
I suppose I'd better go.
Right.
Oh, by the way, can I have that formula now?
Nope.
Never.
Then why did you put me through such misery?
Revenge.
How about dinner next Tuesday?
How about you kiss my cold fusion?
Give me back my pants!
So are we still speaking to each other?
Yes.
If we never talk about how bad we played today.
I can't figure out what went wrong.
Was there something in that hummus?
Let's remember not to let anything like this get in the way of friendship.
You mean success?
I don't think that will be a problem.
I blame Sunset.
Salem, There are five bottles here.
That's very good, Sabrina.
Now, what colour is the tablecloth?
No.
I brewed six.
Where's the last bottle of talent?
Every little thing That you have said and done - Feels like it's deep within me - Feels like it's deep within me  Doesn't really matter If you're on the run It seems like we're meant to be I don't care who you are Hey, guys.
Come on.
Where you're from The game's still tied.
What you did As long as you love me Who you are Where you're from Don't care what you did As long as you love me As long as you love me I've tried to hide it So that no one knows But I guess it shows When you look into my eyes What you did And where you're coming from I don't care As long as you love me, baby What are you doing here?
How come they didn't win?
- I don't care who you are - Who you are Where you're from
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Halt.
You're stuffing my salmon into your book bag.
That red, flaky sockeye is all I have to live for.
Sorry, Salem.
The clubs at school are collecting canned goods for the food drive.
You know, Sabrina, charity begins at home.
In fact, in my mind, it begins in the cat dish.
A whole fish.
Oh!
You're a good witch, Sabrina.
And if there were another cat in the house, I'd share it.
Well, there's always Fluffy next door.
Yeah, yeah, I'll get right on that.
Please remove your shoes and enjoy our show.
Aunt Hilda?
You gonna drive me to school?
I'm fading fast down here.
I just have to get my violin.
Zelda, watch where you're going.
You just bumped right into me.
You bumped into me.
I am so nervous.
I have an audition for a string trio, and these musicians are very serious.
They think Mozart's Requiem is too lighthearted.
- Aunt Hilda?
- Just help me find my keys.
Aunt Hilda, you have three arms.
Don't I wish.
What?
Oh!
How did that get there?
I don't know, but it doesn't match your outfit.
- Zelda.
- I know.
I know.
Aunt Zelda, you only have-- I know.
I still have two eyes.
I have an audition in half an hour.
I cannot show up at the conservatory with three arms.
That's cheating.
We've got a weather advisory for anyone travelling from Neptune to Earth this weekend.
- What's this?
- The Witch Channel.
It's a rip-off at 19.95 a month.
Sunspots will be affecting the entire inner half of the solar system.
Just as I suspected.
What?
What did you suspect?
Sunspots.
They cause molecular instability.
That's how my arm got attached to Hilda.
Is this permanent?
If it is, we'll have to cancel the canoe trip.
We have to fix this.
The people at the conservatory already think I'm a little ditzy.
Wherever would they get that idea?
Well, there was that time Yo-Yo Ma was soloing and I screamed, "Kick up the jams, Yo-Yo".
There's a spell to put our arms back, but I have to look it up.
Sabrina, you'll have to take the bus to school.
Oh!
But I'll be late.
He always picks up other kids.
I'm sorry, but I can't do everything at once.
Especially with only one arm.
I don't think I can go to school with molecular instability in the air.
I mean, what if one of my arms breaks off and gets attached to Harvey?
I don't think I could remain calm.
Because you're half mortal, we don't know how sunspots will affect you.
You'll just have to be extra careful.
I'm drawing a blank.
Now, what was the upside to being a witch?
Need a hand?
Science Club has the worst bin in school.
I brought some liquorice.
Does that help?
We're not really can people at my house.
How'd you do that?
- Do what?
- Your hair.
Oh, no.
Gotta go.
Okay, I'm gonna pass out.
Oh, no.
Molecular instability.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Hi, Harvey.
I'm not sure God ever meant ravioli to be stuffed into a can, but I've got a whole bag of them.
Oh, great, thanks.
What's that?
Hair?
Yeah.
Uh, fake-- Wig.
If you need to put it back on, I've got some duct tape in my locker.
The cheerleaders have collected more canned food than any other club.
I just wish I could get more excited about this.
It's the idea of charity.
It just seems so un-American.
Well, what if we made the food drive a competition?
Would that make it more American?
Are you suggesting we pit one service organisation against the other?
A way of saying: We're better than you are.
I like the way you think.
Competition?
Mr. Kraft, this is a food drive, not a contest.
Sabrina, your wig-thing's on the back of your jacket.
We're not supposed to be collecting food for a prize.
We should do it out of the goodness of our hearts.
Oh, I'm sure that's how it's done, in Red China.
At any rate, thanks to a wonderful suggestion from Libby, the club that collects the most food will be awarded a lovely prize.
And the rest of you can just feel bad.
Good luck, children.
- Well, how'd the audition go?
- Fine.
They wanna come over tomorrow to talk some more.
In other words, spy on me to see if I'm nuts.
Someone told them about the time you tp'd Carnegie Hall.
Don't worry.
We'll both be charming and they will love you for who you are.
Like that's ever worked before.
Oh!
This is not good.
Oh, no.
Molecular instability again.
- I'll get the magic book.
- And maybe a rope?
So, what are you gonna do to Libby?
- Yell?
Insult her in front of everyone?
- No, I'm just gonna talk to her nicely and explain to her that competition is not in the spirit of charity.
And then whack her with a can?
Hold my hair.
Good, I'm just late enough to make a perfect entrance.
Watch it, cheerleader.
Oh, excuse me, Sabrina.
I'm sorry.
Hi, guys, how are you?
What are you grinning at, Harpo?
Fish sticks again?
Couldn't there be an executive side to this cafeteria?
Oh, there's Valerie.
She's gonna sit with us.
She always sits with us.
She's so clingy.
Don't you think she's clingy?
Are you okay, Sabrina?
- Hi.
- Hi.
What?
What did I do wrong?
Nothing.
Clingy.
Hi, guys, I'm gonna go get some dessert.
Anybody want some?
My treat.
Sure, that's so nice of you, thanks.
Oh, why don't you just marry her?
Hey, Emma.
Nice outfit.
Oh, no.
- Mom was wrong again.
- You guys.
- You're hurting her feelings.
- What?
Did you see what Emma's wearing?
I mean, all that's missing is a big red nose and yellow shoes.
It doesn't matter what you wear.
What matters is what's in your heart.
"What matters is what's in your heart".
Put it on a sampler.
Wait, you wanna go to the mall?
I guess.
Hey, not so hard.
You're petting a cat, not polishing andirons.
Excuse me?
Boning up on your magic?
Duh.
I have all this power, I never do anything with it.
Maybe the captain of the football team should grovel at my feet.
Sabrina, I can't quarterback without you.
I'll get back to you.
Hm.
Focusing on the self-serving spells?
- Got a problem?
- Moi?
No way.
I tried to use my powers to take over the world, remember?
Hence the fur.
- Put a sock in it.
I'm trying to read.
- You're kidding, right?
You're not kidding.
I'm still talking.
Sorry.
Coming through.
Sabrina, on behalf of the food drive, I'm giving you this plaque for-- - Excuse me.
- Oh, boy.
Can I have everyone's attention?
Mr. Kraft has an award to present.
The Science Club collected the most canned food, through some miracle, and the award goes to-- Me.
- Thank you, Mr. Kraft.
- Sure.
I'd like to thank all the little people who worked so hard to help me.
But the truth is, I did it all by myself.
So my deepest, sincerest thanks to me.
They didn't even put my name on this stupid plaque.
It just says Science Club.
Like the Science Club would even exist without me.
I'm telling you, if I was running this school-- I wish you were running the school.
You know, the way Libby used to-- Help the blind?
--before she changed.
Yeah, everyone's always liked you, Sabrina, but we were all afraid of Libby.
Now everyone's afraid of you.
- They are?
- Oh, yeah.
You've got the power.
I do, don't I?
What are you looking at?
I can use my power for anything.
For the good of mankind or for the good of me.
Oh, Miss Spellman, I believe it's time for class.
Okay, folks, show's over.
Hilda?
What happened to you?
I'm afraid a small black hole just formed in the sink.
More molecular instability?
It just sucked the kitchen table and a whole platter of tea cakes into oblivion.
Well, what are we gonna do?
Marie and Claude will be here any minute.
They're mortals.
They don't do black holes.
What's going on?
Oh, a small infinite chasm in the sink.
Nothing to worry about.
Well, you guys seem stressed today.
Is there anything I can help you with?
No, no, but how sweet of you to offer.
Anything for two wonderful aunts.
Suckers.
Well, I'm glad to see molecular instability hasn't affected her.
But what about the trio?
We'll have to keep them out of the kitchen.
Oh, and off the sofa and out of the chair.
Gee, this isn't gonna be awkward at all.
What's up?
Looking for a spell to take over my school.
Really?
You know, Sabrina, I've noticed you've become so much more confident and assertive these last few days.
I can turn anyone into a goat.
- Why wouldn't I be confident?
- Precisely.
But since we're thinking about takeovers, why waste your efforts on some rinky-dink little high school?
With your powers, you could do so much more.
How much more?
Perhaps it's time to think globally.
- Won't you come in?
- But not too far.
First, we'll take over the school, then the state.
Then I cast a spell over Congress, making them declare me president of the United States, and at 6 I go live on Larry King.
That's when you know the world is yours.
What a lovely porch.
You feel at home before you're in their home.
I hope Sabrina's feeling better.
She was acting really weird at school.
We can fix that.
Nothing turns a frown upside down better than apple brown Betty.
And her good friend whipped cream.
We hope you don't mind having tea around the piano.
Hilda's just so dedicated to her music, she can't bear to be separated from it.
- Too bad we're not having Chinese.
- Why's that?
Because then she could play Chopsticks.
Excuse me.
Oh.
Ha-ha.
Hi, Harvey, Libby.
Um, it's a hologram.
The door was never actually here.
You know, Zelda's a physicist.
She's always playing pranks with lasers.
You know me.
Wacky Zelda.
- Is Sabrina home?
- Why?
I came by to see her.
Oh.
She's in her room.
Come in.
All right.
If there's opposition, we crush it.
Yeah!
- Resistance, we demolish it.
- Yeah!
If there's fish, we eat it.
Sabrina, you have visitors.
- See who it is and get rid of them.
- Right.
How?
I'm a housecat.
You have teeth, don't you?
Wow.
I love a woman who can take charge.
Don't sit down.
No, no-- You haven't seen our new issue of PennySaver.
I see you have a cat.
I hope you're not allergic.
If you are, we can just throw him outside.
Oh, no, don't.
I love cats.
Of course, I love all living things.
SALEM : Oh, this is wonderful.
Sabrina used to stroke me this way.
Now, what was it I came down here for?
Curse this short attention span.
Is anybody else beginning to wonder whether Sabrina heard you call?
- I'll go up and get her.
What?
Wait.
Don't go up there.
You and your sister have a lovely home, Ms. Spellman.
Would you like a tour?
Oh.
We'd love one.
Just keep your hands inside the bus.
That's a joke.
It's not ditzy.
All right, let's do it.
Dear, didn't you hear, Harvey and Libby-- - Sabrina.
- Uh-oh.
As you can see, we have very serious, sombre wallpaper.
Go.
Excuse me.
Hey, watch it.
Sabrina Spellman, by order of the Witches' Council, you are under arrest.
What's the charge?
Plotting to take over the world.
I might as well let them sit on the couch now.
Watch it.
Overdue library books.
Let's go back to the living room.
But where did those policemen come from?
There's a doughnut shop upstairs.
Sabrina, I don't understand.
What's gotten into you?
I want a lawyer.
Why do I think you had something to do with all this?
Um.
Well, I--  Ms. Spellman, in view of what we've just seen-- I know, it's back to playing square dances.
Oh, and, by the way, "Chopsticks"?
Not funny.
Goodbye.
It was just so special meeting you.
Sabrina's trial starts in five minutes.
But I didn't mean to do anything wrong.
Oh, would you get a grip?
We'll deal with you later.
Order.
Order, order, order.
Sabrina Spellman, you have been found guilty of plotting to take over the mortal world.
Oh, sure, it's mostly water.
It's all they've got.
You have anything to say before sentence is passed?
Your wig looks silly.
Sabrina, that's not what I meant when I said grovel.
Maybe it's all that sugar she eats.
Then this council has no choice but to sentence you to 100 years as a witch familiar.
Let's make her a cat.
- I object.
- On what grounds?
On the grounds that you're mean.
Why did I talk her into it?
I want my old Sabrina back.
The one who used to make me feel all safe and loved.
Maybe that Libby girl is downstairs.
She's got a gentle touch and-- Wait a minute.
Libby.
Sabrina.
But that's not right.
Sabrina.
Libby.
That's it.
Sunspots.
All Sabrina's goodness has somehow gotten into Libby and vice versa.
I have to get to that trial.
But how?
I can't open the door.
Maybe I can use molecular instability to crash my way through it.
Okay, time to go to plan B. Ooh.
Scary mask.
Any last words?
Nanny-nanny-boo-boo?
Oh, I can't watch.
Remind me never to do that again.
The phone.
But who can I call?
Other Realm Pizza, Will this be for pickup or delivery?
Delivery.
I want a pizza as fast as possible.
What kind of toppings would you like, sir?
Let me see.
Fish heads would be nice.
No, I don't have time.
Just bring me anything you got lying around and bring it now.
And don't forget the crazy bread.
- Somebody order a pizza?
Just leave it.
I have a life to save.
Pay in fur for the crime you have committed.
Wait, stop, don't touch a hair on that innocent golden head.
- What's that?
- Salem Saberhagen.
I turned him into a cat 30 years ago.
- Hey, Jimmy.
- How's it going?
Your Honour, I have new evidence which will clear Sabrina of all charges.
I hate it when this happens.
I'm sure Sabrina will be here soon.
- Sabrina, we were getting worried.
- Ew.
Now, all three of you close your eyes.
I'm confused.
Take it from someone older and wiser.
You're gonna spend most of your life confused.
Are we playing a game?
What a dweeb.
No spells in front of the M-O-R-T-A-Ls.
Right, then we'll just have to do it the old-fashioned way.
Can I open my eyes yet?
Yes, Harvey.
- So, Sabrina, you feel any better?
- I feel great.
It was so nice of you to come over.
- Maybe we could still be friends.
- In your dreams.
This house gives me the creeps.
Oh, and the front-door hologram looks completely fake.
I have to get out of here.
I have such a headache.
So you wanna pick up Valerie and get a pizza?
Works for me.
I'm starved.
Nice camouflage.
Did I by any chance try to take over the world this afternoon, get caught by the Witches' Council, get put on trail and almost become a cat, or did I just dream all that?
- Do you really wanna know?
- No.
- I'm sorry about the trio.
- Me too.
Wanna go drop some big things down the sink?
Love to.
Where's Salem?
I wanna thank him for saving the day.
And yell at him for starting the whole thing.
Double cheese, double toppings?
What was I thinking?
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
- Hi, Aunt Zelda.
- Good morning, Sabrina.
That's an interesting take on pyjamas.
By the way, can I borrow your blue sweater?
Oh, no, honey.
You're just not responsible with my clothes.
Remember what happened when you borrowed my red blouse?
Who knew silk was so flammable?
Responsible behaviour is taking care of the things you use.
If I didn't take good care of my mountain-climbing equipment, I could really hurt myself out there.
Hey, you're back.
How was Everest?
Oh, a little crowded, but I had fun.
- Responsible fun.
- Did Salem enjoy it?
Zelda?
Zelda?
Is that a yeti?
I fought the law and the law won.
Quick rehearsal.
First, you compliment him on his sweater vest.
And then you ask him if he's lost weight.
What are you guys doing?
Oh, we're gonna ask Mr. Kraft for his permission and some money to attend a journalism symposium in New York.
Well, he's in a good mood.
He was smiling when he filled out this detention slip.
- Mr. Kraft?
We were wondering-- - No.
We've got him right where we want him.
- Mr. Kraft looked really cute today-- - No.
You two are more alike than you think.
Sabrina, I am not going out with Willard Kraft again.
Know what we did on our last date?
We toured an accordion factory.
But you guys have so much in common.
I mean, you could talk about literature, art, why Valerie and I should be allowed to attend this journalism symposium.
No.
Just the thought of his lips in the same building as mine makes my blood run cold.
That's just what Bacall said about Bogie.
It's from the Other Realm Revenue Service.
Mm, let me see.
They're auditing our magic.
You know, bureaucracy makes the Other Realm seem less enchanting.
This is just a formality.
See, in the mortal realm, witches are allotted a specific amount of magic.
They were pretty lenient until the Pompeii incident.
Some witch with a lava fetish really messed up.
Auditors check up on you now and again to make sure that everything's under control.
But we have nothing to worry about.
I'll just summon our accountant.
Marty?
Zelda, Hilda.
What's up?
It really bothers me that I don't find this weird.
Are we interrupting anything?
No.
Just celebrating our receptionist's birthday.
Would you like some cake?
- Sabrina?
- It's Valerie.
Hey.
I've got big news.
Tell me.
Oh, but upstairs.
Is that filing cabinet tapping?
Yeah, Val.
There's a guy in there.
Marty.
The Other Realm is auditing our magic.
An audit?
That's what I live for.
Here's your return from last year.
Give it a look-see.
Oh.
Time for the conga line.
Don't worry.
I'll make sure everything's in order.
We'll be in touch.
Marge, stop twirling your blouse around and get off the copy machine.
Your grandmother wants to sell you her car?
Isn't it amazing?
I mean, it's not fancy or anything.
Like, there's no air conditioning or tape player or radio or heat.
And the windows don't open.
And it smells like lilacs.
But, hey, it's a car.
It's your first set of wheels.
It's so fantastic.
I know.
There's just one small problem.
I can't afford it.
- Granny's trying to gouge you?
- But I have a plan.
Okay, suppose you and I pool our savings and buy it together.
- We'll share it.
- What a great idea.
Do you what this means?
Our lives are about to change in an utter and profound way.
It'll be you, me and the open road.
Free to go wherever the spirit moves us.
Except left, because that blinker's broken.
Well, I don't know.
Owning a car is a big responsibility.
We've budgeted for maintenance and insurance.
And worked out a way to share it equitably.
See, I get the car every Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 to 12 and from 5 to 8:30.
Except for every third Wednesday when Val needs the car at 8:20 instead of 8:30.
See, and I get it every Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday from 11:15 to 2 and from 7 to 10, except on the second Tuesday in November and the fourth Tuesday in January, I don't have to return it until 10:15.
And on Saturdays, I get the car until 4, Val gets it until 6 and then we alternate every hour until midnight.
I'm getting dizzy.
But you two do seem on top of it.
All we have to do is figure out leap year.
I guess it's okay with us.
Yes.
- All right.
Okay, so according to the schedule, the car is mine tonight?
Yep.
Hey, can I borrow it?
I can't believe I wanted to share a car with someone whose motto is: "I paid for these bumpers, I'll use them".
Well, at least I don't use fast-food wrappers as seat covers.
- Hey.
- Do you look for tow-away zones?
What's it like to lose a car three times in the same parking lot on the same day?
Enough.
You two are too old to be fighting like this.
Though I bet Sabrina could have taken her.
I was right.
You're not responsible enough to handle a car.
I think you should ask Valerie to give your share back.
Fine.
I'll buy my own car.
No.
You may not have a car.
Really?
Not today, not ever.
It's all Valerie's fault.
I could have handled that car alone.
Refresh my memory.
Was it Valerie who locked me in the glove compartment?
Hey, nobody likes a back-seat cat.
I never understood why you didn't buy your own car.
Let's see.
There's the fact that I have virtually no money, my profound lack of cash and, oh, yeah, I'm broke.
Well, not here.
In the Other Realm.
Over there, cars go for peanuts.
Really?
How come?
Cars became more of a novelty item once witches realised they could fly.
If my aunts ask where I went, tell them I'm being very responsible doing something responsible people do.
Avoiding hot dogs at the track?
Well, I'm sure you'll see our magic is completely in order.
Thank you for being so accommodating.
I've never understood it, but some people just don't enjoy being audited.
Is that right?
Well, we'll summon our accountant and then you'll be on your way in no time.
- Marty?
- Marty, it's time for our audit.
Well, that's odd.
Zelda, he's not here.
What's this?
"Dear Zelda and Hilda, don't take this the wrong way, but I've run off with all your magic savings".
Oh, no.
"Someday you'll forgive me, until then, could you water my plants?
Marty".
This can't be true.
Excuse me.
Another piÃ±a colada, por favor.
There must be some mistake.
I'll check the rest of the house-- Not so fast, blondie.
Anything I can help you with, ma'am?
Quizmaster?
What are you doing here?
Sabrina.
I work here part-time.
Quizmastering may be my life's work, but it doesn't exactly pay the rent.
Not with the money you spend on clothes.
Well, I'd like to buy a car, but I'm pretty sure I can't afford one.
Well, can you afford a $5 down payment and a buck 15 a month?
If I budget.
Then you can drive home in this baby.
- Get out.
- Come on.
Let's take it for a spin.
You can see how it drives and I can pick up my dry cleaning.
Buckle up.
Woo.
Woo-hoo!
WOMAN : Mr. Pike, report to the service desk.
Mr. Pike, please report to the service desk.
So, what do you think?
This car handles like a dream.
I mean, did you see the way I swerved to miss that baby carriage?
The last thing I saw was that school bus.
I want this car.
There's just one last thing we need to go over.
Now, owning a car is a big responsibility, Sabrina.
Are you sure you can handle it?
Yes.
Jeez, you sound like my aunts.
Everything okay here, miss?
This is my boss.
Responsibility, schmonsibility.
A car like this is all about fun.
Top down, wind in your hair-- Okay.
You can save the pitch, okay?
I've got a picture of Lincoln that's burning a hole in my pocket.
- I'm buying this car.
- You've made a wise decision.
Nothing makes driving more enjoyable than a car.
Now, you have to be very careful when taking this car out.
Because accidents, they do happen.
I don't need another responsibility lecture.
Oh, this isn't a lecture.
I also sell insurance.
So did you go for the Mack truck like I told you to?
Nothing commands respect like 18 wheels and girlie mud flaps.
I picked out the cutest little car.
Dual exhaust, ragtop, Connolly hide, which I think is a good thing.
They even threw in-- --free delivery.
Now, that can't be good for the transmission.
Sabrina.
Are you okay?
It sounded like something fell.
Something like a redwood.
What's going on in there?
Salem and I are clogging.
Good night.
I've gotta zap this to the street.
If my aunts see it, I can kiss driving it goodbye.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't imply that I clog.
Why--?
Why isn't it working?
Check the emergency brake.
Oh, right.
Good, that'll buy me some time.
Whoa.
- I like this game.
- What's wrong with my magic?
Nothing.
I just don't like being alone.
You can talk?
It was on my sticker.
I don't wanna sleep outside.
In case you haven't noticed, it's cold.
Look, I know you'd rather stay in my room, but you can't.
My aunts would kill me if they found out.
I could catch pneumonia out here.
You could, if you had blood and organs.
Sabrina?
Oh, no.
Keep it down, okay?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You sound like my first wife.
Hey.
I thought I heard you.
Who were you talking to?
Pet lizard.
Where did that little guy run off to?
I came by to apologise.
You know all those horrible, nasty things I said about you?
- I didn't mean them.
- Me neither.
- Friends?
- Friends.
Hey, hot car.
When did you get it?
Uh, just a few minutes ago.
From a new neighbour who's moving to Australia.
It's so cool.
- Can I borrow it?
- But you have a car.
My grandma's ride to church died, so she wants it back.
Please?
Valerie, this is kind of hard to explain, but--  Those files aren't gonna carry themselves in here.
Just let me hear Jerry Springer's thought for the day and I'll meet you in the garage.
Uh, sure, you can borrow it.
In fact, why don't you keep it at your place?
That way you can park it somewhere warm and it will never be lonely.
- Lonely?
- British engineering.
Very delicate.
Here.
Thank goodness we saved this stuff.
No, I saved it.
I save things.
I just forget where I save them.
That's called losing things.
If I hadn't had the foresight to put everything in my name, the house, the phone, the credit cards we would never get out from under this audit.
So how was the garage?
Nice and empty?
It's from the auditors.
Oh, what a relief.
They're cancelling the audit?
No.
It says they're only going to audit you.
Why would that be?
Because everything's in your name.
Good luck, sis.
Looks like there's nothing but free time for me.
And what better way to enjoy that free time than by relaxing in the company of Mr. Kraft?
No.
I really think my plan is gonna work.
I'll just keep the car hidden at Valerie's.
You know, this is how people get hurt.
Oh, no.
What are you doing here?
Hello to you too.
You know, that little brunette is a menace to motoring.
And she sings along with the radio.
Either that or she's been injured.
Hello?
Sabrina.
I just looked outside and I can't find your car.
I think somebody stole it.
Oh, no, no, no.
I've got it.
The car's here with me.
Phew!
- Oh, well, good night.
- See you tomorrow.
Hey, I heard a good story.
- Hello?
- Why did you take the car?
Yeah, it is unbelievable.
I mean, you'd think they'd tire of it after maybe six or seven times, but no.
These seniors still seem to find removing my brake fluid very amusing.
Let me get this straight.
Your aunt had an allergic reaction to frozen yogurt, so you came over to my house in a cab and took the car?
In a manner of speaking.
Did you drive it to school today?
No.
I left it at home.
Hey.
Did you guys see the cool orange MGB parked in front of the school?
- Oh, I did drive it.
That's mine.
- But I have the keys.
I hot-wired it.
Can I have the keys back?
Okay.
Let me borrow it during lunch, please?
I don't know.
It depends on how it's behaving.
I mean running.
It was fine.
Thanks, Sabrina.
Where did you ever learn how to hot-wire a car?
My Aunt Zelda.
She did time.
When are you gonna let me tune up your new ride?
My dad showed me how to make a car go 80 miles an hour in first gear.
Why would anyone want their car to do that?
He didn't say.
Hey.
- I need my keys.
- Oh, I don't have them.
- I did something you'll love me for.
- I am?
- I lent your car to Mr. Kraft.
- What?
Apparently, he's got a hot date and a car with no brake fluid.
And guess what he gave us in return.
Permission and bus fare to attend the journalism symposium.
Way to go, Valerie.
Did Mr. Kraft say where he was going on his date?
I don't know.
When he started singing "I'm in the Mood for Love," I got woozy.
So until you produce your missing savings account, we're putting a lien on your magic.
No magic cabinet, no magic cauldron, no laptop.
But I'm a witch.
How will I cast spells?
With this.
This isn't magic.
This is a crummy bar mitzvah.
Well, don't you look stupid.
Sabrina, what are you doing home so late?
I was looking for Mr. Kraft to return a pen I borrowed.
There haven't been any live police chases on TV tonight, have there?
Mr. Kraft is at the drive-in with your aunt Hilda.
- What?
- Isn't that nice?
I'm stunned with happiness.
Hilda knew how much you wanted to go to that symposium, so she thought she'd put in a good word for you.
That was so sweet.
I should thank her.
In fact, I should thank her right now.
A Joe Don Baker retrospective.
- What a treat.
- Yep.
Buford Pusser fans don't come any bigger than me.
Hey.
Hey, car.
Oh, look who's here.
Miss I'll-Let-Anybody-Drive-Him.
Look, I promise you can stay in my room forever, okay?
If you just do me a favour and behave yourself tonight, okay?
I bet you don't even care that I'm parked on gum.
I do care.
It's just that's my aunt and my vice principal in your front seat, so if you could just keep your voice down.
You really had me fooled.
I thought you were kind and warm-hearted.
Boy, was I wrong.
Did you just snort?
Look, I'll explain everything later, okay?
Honest.
Later, later, later.
You never have time for me.
Now you sound like your first wife.
That's hitting below the fan belt.
I need to be alone.
No.
No, don't do that.
That would be bad.
Please don't be in my room.
Please don't be in my room.
Please don't be in my room.
All right.
Chalk one up to the power of positive thinking.
Aunt Hilda, how was the movie?
I laughed, I cried.
You're in big trouble.
What about Mr. Kraft?
I mean, did you put him under a spell?
No.
Fortunately, he passed out from terror.
Still breathing.
I know it's gonna be a while before you two are done yelling at me, so should we brew a magic potion for Mr. Kraft?
I can't.
The auditors booted my laptop.
Besides, sometimes I worry that all those potions we give him are gonna have some sort of side effect.
Willard, you are so witty.
Thanks again for a lovely evening.
- Good night.
- Hilda.
I was-- I have got to start videotaping my dates.
We have to think of a suitable punishment for Sabrina.
She has to learn how to behave responsibly.
It's time like these that I regret donating our iron maiden to Goodwill.
Well, look at that.
They always return to the scene of the crime.
Zelda, Hilda, what I did was wrong.
You better not be talking about buying that shirt.
You two have done so much for me.
You've kept me employed.
You-- You put a roof over my head.
How will I ever earn your forgiveness?
You can start by paying us back all the magic you stole from us.
There's a slight problem with that.
See, the guy at the casino-- Okay.
I'll earn it back.
I will.
I just need a place to lie low for a while.
We know the perfect place.
Zelda?
Hilda?
Anybody?
Is that a yeti?
WOMAN : Any available service manager, Line 1.
Quizmaster.
I can't handle this thing.
It's nothing but trouble.
That's why I sold you this car.
To make you realise you weren't ready for one.
You took a job here just to teach me a lesson?
No.
I've got college loans.
Well, let's take this baby to Guido and turn back its odometer.
Make yourself scarce, huckster.
I need a few minutes alone with Miss Learner's Permit.
No problem.
That Chrysler's teaching me Spanish.
I'm sorry things didn't work out.
Me too.
I've got something for you on my dash.
WOMAN : Any available service manager, Line 1.
"What is a friend"?
Aw.
If you read the inside, you'll see that a friend is someone who changes someone's oil once in a while.
I'll miss you too.
Walking shoes are a much better investment.
They're fun, cheap and no way you can ruin friendships or endanger innocent lives, right?
I loved that sports car.
- Kraft alert.
- How bad could it be?
He already said we couldn't go to the journalism symposium.
Miss Spellman.
Just the little miscreant I've been looking for.
Good, because I gotta go to metal shop.
Me too.
If you're late, they don't let you wear the masks.
Now, hold it.
You know what I have here?
- Your drawings?
- No.
It's a file that I've been keeping on you and all of your strange behaviour.
But they're illustrated, right?
For instance, the other night I went to the movies with your aunt.
And the next thing I know, I'm alone on your front porch.
Explain that.
Oh, well, you know what they say about men your age and memory lapses.
Okay, if you say so, I'll check into the chess club.
Gotta go.
Mother's right.
I need more potassium.
Thank goodness my magic will be restored next week.
I despise doing laundry the mortal way.
Here's a tip: It's not equal parts water and bleach.
Oh, I see you decided to bring Marty back from outer space.
Not exactly.
Haven't I been punished enough?
I mean, all I did was almost kill you and Mr. Kraft.
Get back in there and do some more filing, young lady.
And don't just stand around the water cooler telling jokes.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Hey.
Guess what.
The New Yorker accepted my short story?
Mrs. Quick read my essay, "How Math Applies to Real Life".
She liked it so much, she wants me to read it in front of math class.
That's wonderful.
Isn't it, Zelda?
Zelda?
Zelda.
Attention, Zelda.
Did you say something?
Oh.
I'm sorry.
I have to present a paper at a big scientific symposium in the Other Realm, and I have so much more research to do.
Oh, that's okay.
I just wanted to tell you about my Aunt Zelda?
Aunt Zelda!
I am really worried about her.
She hasn't eaten or slept in days.
She's even been too busy to disapprove of me.
She must be dead.
She's been working too hard.
She needs to relax.
Maybe we could try aromatherapy or a mallet?
I know what to do.
Aloha?
It's hopeless.
I guess you and I might as well have a luau.
No, thanks.
Mai tai might make me groggy for homeroom.
The cat could party.
Mmm.
Hi.
I'm Betsy Ross.
You need a flag by when?
So, what did Mrs. Quick like best about your essay?
That my ideas were clear and concise.
Clear, concise.
Got it.
Next time I write an essay, I'll be sure to be fuzzy and wordy.
That way I'll avoid the terror you're about to endure.
What are you talking about?
It's in front of students.
- What's the big deal?
- Sabrina, guess what.
I liked your essay so much, I've arranged for you to read it in front of all of the math classes in school.
Valerie thinks there's something stressful about speaking in public.
- What do you think?
- Oh, I don't know.
I don't get stressed.
I get hives.
Feed me.
Is she still working?
She's supposed to feed me every half-hour.
I'm so weak.
I'm in the mood for crepes.
Don't worry.
I've come up with a plan to bring Zelda back to reality.
Or you could feed me.
"Divide that by equal parts of--" - Must need new glasses.
- Zelda?
You have us all really worried.
I'm trying to attain a deeper understanding of molecules.
I want to ennoble humanity.
I know, and that has to stop right now.
Maybe I have been working too hard.
- I can't just stop cold turkey.
- Turkey?
Please.
Don't worry.
I've come up with a plan that will keep you occupied and relaxed all at the same time.
Come with me.
Now.
We've always wanted to organise the family photos.
And you'll be able to keep busy without working yourself into a frenzy.
Oh I've always loved this picture of Uncle Toots.
- I'll put it right here.
- Good.
Oh, this is relaxing.
But maybe Cousin Emma's photo would be better on this page.
- Zelda.
- Let's see.
Uncle Toots' black hair would look best - next to Uncle Emmet's yellow teeth.
- Zelda!
Or should I arrange them by head size?
Aren't you going to congratulate me?
I'm your new spring queen.
We haven't voted for that yet.
Voting.
You're so naive.
Come Friday and the gap between us will be even greater due to myroyal station.
I'd genuflect, but my Tater Tots are getting cold.
Well, I'm going out for track again.
But last year you impaled yourself on the hurdles.
Yes, but on the bright side I discovered I also enjoy food through a tube.
Hey, did you hear?
Sabrina's reading her essay to all the math classes.
Oh, man, that's brave.
What's the big deal?
I mean, what could go wrong?
- You might start vomiting.
- And let's not forget sweating.
Or sweating's emotional cousin: weeping.
None of these things are shameful.
unless you have a problem with a nickname like "Pit Stains".
Sabrina, here's some good news.
It took some doing, but I convinced Mr. Kraft to let you read your essay at tomorrow's assembly.
Does this look infected?
Oh.
So tomorrow's assembly.
I'll be in the front row, just like I was for Titanic.
Only this will be way more disastrous.
I've gotta find Mr. Kraft and tell him I can't do this.
You have to do it.
It's all set.
I tried to get Steve Allen, but he's already booked.
So now it's all up to you.
It's just an assembly.
Oh, no.
No, it is the first assembly that Principal Larue has put me in charge of, so it has to be a great speech.
We are talking FDR's first inaugural address.
We are talking Lincoln at Gettysburg.
We are talking Billy Crystal at the Oscars.
Has to be that good.
Well, "Pit-Stain Spellman" does have a certain ring to it.
This is so good.
- What is it?
- A sour ball I found under the couch.
Hey, how was school?
Awful.
I have a big problem.
I gotta talk to Aunt Zelda.
Wait a minute.
Why do you always go to Zelda with your problems?
I mean, I'm your aunt too.
Why don't you tell me what's going on?
Okay.
Well, I have to read an essay at an assembly, and I'm terrified.
Oh, this is a problem.
Have you considered running away from it?
That was my first thought.
Aunt Hilda, sometimes you underestimate me.
Wait, wait.
Give me a second chance.
I know.
You know, a little fear can be a good thing.
You just have to learn to live with it and deal with it.
That is good advice, but not what I wanted to hear.
What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?
Do you think I should I talk to Zelda?
Is that a Jolly Rancher under the table?
Zelda, Sabrina has a problem.
Morris' picture will completely destroy the Uncle Emmet sequence.
Zelda?
Zelda?
Danger, Will Robinson.
Zelda?
Zelda, what happened?
Speak to me.
Oh.
I love your lipstick.
You are a classy broad.
You got cul-cha.
- Come again?
- Come on, doll face.
Let's do the Charleston.
Something has happened to Zelda.
I have to deal with it.
Okay, dancing is not the answer.
Sabrina?
When are you gonna come out from under your blanket?
Never.
- Don't be afraid.
Life is short.
Oh, please.
What fearless thing have you done lately?
Well, I-- I slept in a pile of laundry I wasn't familiar with.
Look, haven't you figured this witch thing out yet?
- The magic book?
- Unless you're afraid of it now.
Let's see.
"Fear, removal of.
See Page 113.
Before extracting fear, see warning".
Hello, Sabrina.
Hey.
Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
You're the guy who said, "We have nothing to fear but fear itself".
Actually, what I wanted to say was, "We have nothing to fear but poverty," but my advisers told me I should come up with something a little punchier.
Good line.
Great delivery.
Thanks.
Sabrina, I must tell you that if you use your magic to get rid of your fear, it could cast a shadow on the rest of your life.
Have you ever had to read an essay in front of a high school assembly?
Well, no, but I did overcome polio to become the leader of the free world, and I carried this country through the biggest economic crisis in its history.
And I faced the forces of totalitarianism in the gravest conflict in recorded time.
But you never had to read an essay in front of a high school assembly?
Uh No.
Then you can't relate to what I'm saying, can you, Mr. President?
All right.
"To activate fear removal, drink a glass of water while opened to this page".
Close the book.
Close the book.
Salem, don't be such a scaredy-cat.
I can't wait for the assembly tomorrow.
My essay's gonna rock.
Looks like your fear is gone.
Yeah, you're right.
The fear must have been scared out of me.
Whoo-hoo!
Stop it.
Oh, you know I can't stand this ride.
Woo-ho-ho.
Hold me.
No doubt about it, a clear case of witch snap.
It happens to witches' minds when they've been overworked.
Okay, Skipper.
You and Gilligan forge for berries while I prepare a coconut soufflÃ©.
Why is she acting like that?
Right now she's going through gingersnap.
I'm glad you figured that out, Professor.
Now maybe you can think of a way to fix the hole in the boat.
The only thing that will cure her is no stress.
So make sure that she has nothing on her mind.
Well, if I recall that character correctly, she doesn't.
- What's up, Val?
- Aah!
Why are you looking at me like that?
You don't want to be my friend anymore, do you?
Valerie, are you all right?
No.
Sabrina keeps staring at me, and it's making me nervous.
Well, maybe you should see the nurse.
I was gonna have her check out my hives.
- I don't see any hives.
- Oh.
I can see the nurse has poisoned you with her lies too.
Come on, Valerie.
Wait a minute, is magic behind this?
Come on, Sabrina, don't jump to conclusions.
KRAFT : Attention, everyone, this is Vice Principal Kraft.
I have an important announcement to make.
I don't want to die!
Okay.
Time to jump to conclusions.
ZELDA : Grab the stwingy, Sawum.
- Isn't this fun?
- Hilda.
It'll pass.
She's just going through the sugar-snap phase of witch snap.
I'm gonna give Salem a hug.
Does Kevorkian do animals?
Ugh!
Unbelievable.
Zelda balances this chequebook every month, and I've never seen her in a homicidal rage.
Well, if you feel like killing someone, might I suggest Zelda?
Oh, no.
Zelda, your symposium is tonight.
If your paper isn't presented, you'll be kicked out of the academy.
Do you think you can pull yourself together to give it?
- I'm gonna kiss you.
- Okay, that would be a no.
Hey, Sabrina.
Zelda wants you to try to balance that chequebook.
I can't.
I'm too upset.
I-- I tried to overcome my fear by casting a spell.
Now there's this shadow following people around school.
Oh, no.
If you use magic to release your fear, the fear gets loose and preys on mortals.
Didn't Millard Fillmore warn you?
Actually, it was FDR, but I blew him off.
FDR?
Oh, they've upgraded the magic book.
Excuse me.
Aren't we in the midst of a crisis here?
Right.
You've gotta go back and get everyone in the entire school who's been affected by your fear shadow to come home with you.
Oh, no problem.
Right after I end hunger.
No, and hurry, the longer the shadow is loose, the greater the fear will grow.
Okay.
When I said crisis, I meant Zelda.
She's putting booties on me.
Wait, Valerie, stop!
Why are you so afraid?
The earth, the stars, space.
We're decomposing as we speak.
Mr. Kraft, I need you to get everyone out of this school and to my house.
Oh.
That is just what my enemies want.
- Enemies?
- I am surrounded by enemies.
People plotting against me behind my back.
People who want my assembly to fail.
There's nothing going on behind your back - except - Ah!
Mr. Kraft, when are you gonna formally make me spring queen?
I know you.
You're one of the four horsemen.
The one with too much eye shadow.
We should never have stopped school prayer.
Wait, why are you wearing so much makeup?
Because what if I'm not made spring queen?
Then the next thing you know, I'm not gonna be summer princess or autumn empress or winter goddess.
What if I never win another seasonal beauty pageant again?
Wait, you have some lipstick on your teeth!
My hives have turned into gangrene.
Will you cut off my arm?
I have a hacksaw at my house.
If we go right now-- No!
I can't risk being exposed to sunlight.
If you won't help me, then I'll just have to gnaw it off myself.
Harvey!
Don't touch me!
You could break a bone.
Good thing you stopped me.
I was gonna put my hand on your shoulder.
I just don't wanna get hurt.
Football, hockey, track, cards.
They're all so dangerous.
- Cards?
- You ever had a paper cut?
Who do you think I am, Evel Knievel?
Attention, I've just been informed that Vermont has declared war on Massachusetts.
Luckily, there's a bomb shelter at my house.
So if we all hurry, we can get there in time, but the most important thing to remember is--  Ahhh!
- Don't panic!
Okay, Salem, since I have to present Zelda's paper for her, you have to help me.
Okay.
"The uses of the hyrazine--"  It's pronounced "hyraxine".
Zelda, you're back!
- It's pronounced "hyraxine".
- Uh-oh.
Zelda, what's your favourite soft drink?
It's pronounced "hyraxine".
Great.
It's the biggest night of Zelda's scientific career, and she has the verbal skills of a potato.
It's pronounced "potahto".
I managed to get everyone from school to come home.
Great.
Now all you have to do is get the shadow through the closet and into the Other Realm.
Well, how do I get it into the house and keep everyone else out?
You know how dogs can smell fear?
Well, fear can smell dogs.
Let me in the bomb shelter.
Let me-- A pack of wild dogs!
Oh.
I thought they'd never leave.
Oh.
Well, I'm glad we took care of that.
They can handle my fear in the Other Realm.
You have to go to the Other Realm and confront your fear, or it will always haunt you.
Do I have to go alone?
Isn't there a group package available?
- Can you come?
- Oh!
Yeah, like I don't have enough to do.
- Brrrr-rrr-rrr.
- Stop that.
Why don't you take Quizmaster.
He's knowledgeable, resourceful, and he's strong.
- I'm gonna need someone strong?
- If you wanna live.
Go.
I have a paper to give.
Oh, I hate being the responsible one.
Once again, no one remembers to feed the cat.
Why is it so dark in here?
Well, your fear shadow has engulfed this whole area.
Everything you encounter here will be one of your subconscious fears.
It is the forest of your fears.
- Really?
That's what it's called?
- Well, actually, it's called Pine Valley.
Anyway, I just flew in from out of town, and, boy, is my broom tired.
Okay, so on with the lecture.
Okay, it-- It starts with kind of a triangular symbol, and then I-- I guess the scientific term for what comes next would be the thingy.
This is hard.
I-- I just have to concentrate.
Hilda.
Hilda, what are you doing?
What's going on?
Hah!
Oh, dear.
The eensy-weensy spider Went up the waterspout Now, you see that door?
You have to make it through that door without turning back.
Is that all?
I guess we came to the forest of my fears on an off day.
- Mrs. Quick!
- She's not really Mrs. Quick.
She's a symbolic manifestation of your fears.
But Mrs. Quick doesn't scare me.
Oh, I'm so glad to hear that because I've talked to several universities, and no one will accept you.
I don't like this game anymore.
I'm going home.
Sabrina, you have to move forward.
You don't know this, but you're not gonna do very well on your SATs.
No college, no future, Sabrina.
I have your fast-food uniform right here.
No!
No.
No, I'll be okay.
There's always trade school.
Wow.
I am afraid of not getting into college.
Maybe that's my biggest fear.
No, it's people jumping out from behind trees.
Sabrina, you're a good friend with a soft heart.
Ooh.
I'm shaking.
You should be because a soft heart will only hold you back in the real world.
You have to be tough in the real world.
- You mean, you can't just be nice?
- Nice guys finish last, Sabrina.
- What about Mister Rogers?
- Have you seen his ratings?
Jimmy Carter and Audrey Hepburn and other nice people.
I mean, occasionally, nice people do succeed.
You know what?
I've had enough.
I'm gonna go to my room and cower.
Sabrina, come on, you're doing okay.
You have to be brave.
That way.
Hilda, why don't you sit here and occupy yourself while I talk to the nice Nobel Laureates.
Well, you came here to hear me read my paper, so let's get right to it.
Hilda, no.
It-- It's a clown.
I've always been afraid of clowns.
Oh, so the way you dress is how you confront your fears?
Are you afraid of being snatched baldheaded?
Because that's what's going to happen.
I'm not afraid of clowns.
Why are you scaring the quizmaster in the forest of my fears?
I'm not gonna waste my scariness on you, freak.
Although, as long as I'm here, I may as well remind you that everybody has commented on how you're different.
Hey, I don't care if Sabrina's - different.
Ha-ha-ha.
But she's not just different.
I happen to know she's a witch.
ALL : You're a witch!
You're a witch!
You're a witch!
No!
No!
No!
You're a witch!
You're a witch!
Wait a minute!
Right, I am a witch.
I'm proud of being a witch because it means I can do this: Way to go, Sabrina.
All you have to do is walk through that door and face your ultimate and final fear.
If you find my nervous system anywhere around, I'd like it back.
And now, to read from her essay, "How Math Applies to Real Life," Sabrina Spellman.
"In the beginning there was the word, but in order to mark when the beginning was, we needed numbers.
Making math as big a part of life as language, although not quite as big as TV".
"At first, math seemed so complicated, I was afraid of it, but once I took the time to study, it wasn't scary to me anymore, which proves that knowledge and experience are the best weapons against fear".
Thank you.
Great speech, Sabrina.
Now you can finally face your fear.
Wow, my fear looks just like Steve Allen.
Ha-ha.
I know what fear is, believe me.
I did live TV.
- It's a pleasure to finally meet you.
- Wait a minute.
Meet.
That rhymes with sweet.
You gave me an idea for a song.
When you beat your feet Down the street All the little birdies Go tweet, tweet, tweet He's gone.
All right.
Fear is out of my life forever.
Oh, not quite.
He's there to remind you that fear is something that will always be a part of you.
You have to be willing to deal with it.
Hey, is Steve Allen gonna be on all my clothes now?
Oh, come on, Sabrina.
Don't take everything so seriously.
Lighten up.
All right, whatever you say.
Oh.
Clowns.
Yeah, well, you know, I can handle that.
Everyone said they loved my speech.
Mr. Kraft said it was up there with something Steve Allen would do.
That's nice, dear.
Aunt Zelda, you seem down in the dumps.
Oh, it's nothing.
Just my scientific career is now in a shambles.
Hey, there's a message from the Other Realm in the toaster.
Get it out so I can make an English muffin.
I don't believe it.
Because of the symposium fiasco, I've been given a grant to study abnormal phenomena in already abnormal witches.
Thank you, boys.
The songs of Bavaria, we'll never forget them.
She's in the Lawrence Welk-snap stage of witch snap.
This is perfect.
And now, a little polka.
And a one-a and a two-a and a three-a.
I didn't know it until now, but Aunt Hilda playing the accordion is my biggest fear.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
You think maybe she's dead?
- Forget it.
This is totally impossible.
- You've got to be patient.
Turning yourself into fire, water and wind is one of the hardest things a witch has to learn.
For me, it was learning when to say no to pie.
Listen, stop thinking about how bad it feels to get it wrong, and start thinking about how good it's gonna feel when you get it right.
Okay, I'll try again, but this time if my legs go numb, I want help getting off the bed not just pointing and jeering.
Concentrate.
You are no longer a physical being.
You are a fluid entity.
You are water.
Hey, I did it.
Yes, you did.
And it only took you four weeks.
Am I the only one thinking we should have purchased some rubber sheets?
It's me in a nutshell.
Oh, no.
I knew this day would come.
Zelda, there's no music.
Westbridge High just hired me to be their new substitute chemistry teacher.
But teaching's so frustrating for you.
Didn't you once storm out in the middle of a class and never come back?
Yes, but that was only because they kept asking questions.
And anyway, that was a long time ago.
Gosh, I wonder what happened to them.
Do you think Professor Spellman forgot about us?
Let's give it another five minutes.
Good morning.
- Good morning, Sabrina.
Guess who's going to be your new substitute teacher.
Me.
Great.
You know, fitting in is hard enough without someone calling me sweet pea.
I thought I was the only one you called sweet pea.
Look, it'll only be for a couple of weeks.
Mr. Melena might get out of ICU today.
Do you think sea-monkeys make good pets?
If you like low maintenance.
How long would it take to hop across the world on your tongue?
Oh, I don't know, about six or seven-- Oh, yeah.
This is a much better use of your time than studying for your elements test.
For you.
An invitation?
To what?
MAN'S  You are cordially invited to enjoy high tea at the 753rd annual quizmaster-pupil social.
Parking free with validation.
Cool.
Sounds like fun.
It's got to be better than last year.
The highlight was a piÃ±ata.
I'll pick you up this afternoon.
Today?
I can't go today.
I have a million things to do.
Sorry.
Attendance is mandatory.
You know, every once in a while you could try bringing good news.
A new Pollo Loco just opened up by my apartment.
I meant good news for me.
Hi, Sabrina.
Funny how you know my name and we are in no way related.
Hey, Sabrina, your aunt's here.
You just had to tell everyone, didn't you?
Well, are you nervous?
Oh, no, I'm feeling very confident.
My lesson is prepared.
It's clear, concise.
These students are gonna learn like they've never learned before.
Thereby creating the redox reaction.
So let's solve that problem.
So when you add the copper to the nitric acid, what will happen?
Then Mr. Copper Man marries Mrs. Acid.
And they go on their noxious gas honeymoon.
You have a question?
The bell rang ten minutes ago.
Can we go now?
I can't believe you don't know how to turn yourself into fire and wind yet.
The test is in three days.
If you don't pass you won't get your witch's licence.
You've mentioned that to me, oh, 5,000 times.
- I can turn myself into water.
- Anybody can do that.
You see that waiter there?
Those aren't cocktails, that's a tray full of students.
Ohhh.
I don't wanna know what the crab cakes were.
Good the head quizmaster doesn't know you don't know your elements.
- I'd be dead meat.
- It's all about you.
You know what your problem is?
Other students focus on getting it right.
You focus on how you don't wanna get it wrong.
Wow, how does it feel to be the most brilliant person in the universe?
You'd think it'd pay more.
Is there an exit in here?
Well, each of those chairs has a swirling vortex.
I gotta get away from my quizmaster or as I like to call him, "If-Evil-Had-a-Face".
Is that an Indian name?
Having trouble on your elements test?
Yeah.
I can't concentrate.
I mean, my quizmaster keeps lecturing me.
Really?
They're supposed to make it fun, not hard.
- Which one is he?
- The one dressed like a rodeo clown that keeps shoving tea cakes in his mouth.
So you can see why I wanna leave.
You're supposed to stay for the whole thing.
Besides, I hear there's a door prize.
Yeah, I saw it.
It's actually a door.
Well, some people think that expansion has diluted the quizmaster talent pool.
Or maybe there's just a certain type of person drawn to the job.
Sabrina, there was a student who turned herself into fire while drinking the glass of water.
That was incredible.
Darn, it's amazing the things you miss when you're desperately trying to avoid you.
Hi, everyone.
I just wanted to thank you all for coming, and tell you that I'm so pleased to see such a great turnout today.
- Who's that?
- That's the head quizmaster.
I think her official title is "the person who can fire your butt".
But she's so young.
Yeah, she looks pretty good for 600.
You okay, Sabrina?
You're whiter than usual.
Oh, no.
I'm just sick, very, very sick.
In fact, we should go before I do or say something that makes me sicker.
Hello again.
You two know each other?
- Yes, we've-- - We've never met.
You must be thinking of my evil twin, but usually she's a brunette.
Heh.
Quizmaster 72469, are you aware that Sabrina is very unhappy with your teaching?
Well, she's in high school.
She's unhappy with everything.
- What's going on?
- I don't know.
Sounds like someone ate the tapioca pudding way past the expiration date.
Effective immediately, you are terminated as Sabrina's quizmaster.
- What?
Bu-- - That will be all.
Why doesn't anybody age in this realm?
Thank you for listening, Salem.
I get frustrated trying to get these students to understand this chemistry.
It just really helps to talk about it out loud.
No problem-o.
- Hi, honey.
How was your tea?
- Pretty average, you know.
There was music, little sandwiches, tea, of course.
Oh, and I got my quizmaster fired.
- What kind of sandwiches?
- What happened?
Oh, nothing.
I inadvertently said terrible things about him to a complete stranger who turned out to be his boss.
Ha.
It's really kind of funny when you think about it.
I don't get it.
Was the quizmaster angry?
I wish.
He was hurt.
Aunt Zelda, what am I gonna do?
I have to fix this.
Well, the Witches' Council has jurisdiction over the quizmasters.
So you're gonna have to talk to them.
Good.
Maybe I can explain things and get my quizmaster back.
Oh.
That's not a joke either.
And so I'm really sorry the whole thing ever happened.
It's totally my fault.
I'm completely to blame.
And there might have been something weird in the punch.
You've stated your case eloquently.
- No.
- Why?
Miss Spellman, you explained how you got your quizmaster fired, but you never explained why you need him back.
Oh.
Well, did I mention the punch?
Quizmaster 72469, as of this moment, you are assigned a new student.
Meet Ralph.
Sir, it is an honour to meet you.
I've been following your career for years, and it is a privilege to work with you.
Ralph, I'm gonna enjoy working with you too.
You can't be serious.
You're not seriously gonna teach him, are you?
I mean, look at him.
- He's obviously a troublemaker.
- You heard the judge.
But we can fight it.
I mean, I said I was sorry.
Don't do this.
Why don't you just accept it.
I mean, you weren't learning with me.
- It's over.
- Great.
Have a nice life.
- Nice knowing you.
- Yeah.
- Well, fine, then.
- Fine.
- Fine.
- Fine!
Let's go, Ralph.
I give them a month.
I'm so at peace with what's happened between me and the quizmaster.
I believe everything happens for a reason.
And that's why we call this stage "denial".
Hi, sweetheart.
How you feeling today?
I can't believe quizmaster hasn't had the decency to call me after all the mean things he said?
Welcome, anger.
Well, maybe you two just need a little time away from each other.
Hey, I bet that's a letter from him.
Get to the real grovelling parts.
No, it's from the Witches' Council.
It says they're temporarily out of quizmasters, so you'll have to be home-schooled.
Well, I'm sure you'll be an even better teacher than the quizmaster.
I'm afraid I'm too busy substituting to do it.
It's your aunt Hilda.
You know what we haven't played in a long time?
Goofy golf.
No!
And let's give a big warm welcome to sadness.
We don't have to play.
I think I'm turning into wind.
I feel a little breeze.
That's just the life going out of us.
I guess I've kind of forgotten how to turn myself into any of the elements.
Take your time, Aunt Hilda.
It's okay, you know, my test is only in two days!
I just haven't turned myself into wind in years.
Would cabbage help?
I guess the last time was when I was on vacation in the Caribbean with my boyfriend, Danny.
We got into a fight and he stormed out to take a walk.
Well, I didn't want him to enjoy his walk, so I  But in the end, the joke was on me.
He fell in love with one of his rescue workers.
This is ridiculous.
I can't figure out this stupid redox reaction, can you?
No, but that could be because this is the class before lunch.
Well, at least we're not the only ones.
Looks like Libby's about to have a nervous breakdown.
Libby, do you have a question?
Do you want me to explain the problem again?
No.
Forget it.
Just give me an F. I'm getting an A in typing.
It'll average out.
Perhaps an analogy will help you.
Say you have a sweater and a skirt that you always wear together.
And say, one day, you decide to wear the sweater with a new skirt.
Therefore, the new skirt and the old skirt both change into something different.
That's exactly what happens to the copper.
This is great.
Is Libby actually drooling?
You see, the copper-- Gives an electron to the hydrogen in the nitric acid causing the copper to become a solution.
That's it, Libby.
And that means the hydrogen would be released as a gas.
Mm-hm.
Give it a try.
- Oh!
Oh-ho-ho.
- Way to go, Libby!
Oh.
Oh, dear Lord.
I just hugged a teacher.
Great!
Well, I can never touch Aunt Zelda again.
I've got it.
I remember how to turn myself into fire.
If it involves dry branches and kerosene, it's not really magic.
No, it's so easy.
All you have to do is think like fire.
Well, that's helpful.
I'm really enjoying Vague University.
I can't believe I finally figured out how to do it and I can't explain it.
Might I suggest the fine art of shadow puppets.
You know what, maybe it would help if I talked you through it once.
Good idea.
Ready?
Okay?
Be fire!
I'm gonna fail.
I know you can do this.
You're just not thinking.
Yes, I am.
I'm talking, aren't I?
Don't you have to think to be able to talk?
No.
Parrots talk.
So now I'm a parrot.
I'm as dumb as a bird.
Is that it?
That's not what I meant.
Besides, parrots aren't dumb.
At that show at the zoo, they ride bicycles.
I'm going upstairs.
That is, if I can figure out how to use the stairs.
Sabrina, wait.
What just happened here?
They also have a goose who can tap dance.
What?
Hi, I'm looking for my quizmaster.
Well, my ex-quizmaster.
Who are you?
I'm his roommate.
But from the way I clean up after him you'd think I was his mother.
Come on in.
Hey, some broad's here to see you.
Wow, this place would drive a rat insane.
Heh.
No offence.
Oh.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Hate to interrupt your sparkling repartee with Dorothy Parker, but we're out of charcoal briquettes.
Man, put it on the list.
Look, I just came by because I was updating my address book and I forgot your apartment number.
- It's 2.
- Right.
I'm really sorry about what happened the other day.
It was all my fault.
I was mad, and you know, I said some things-- I was beginning to worry.
Hello, Sabrina.
What's he doing here?
- Nothing.
I'm just quizzing him.
- At your apartment?
You never quizzed me at your apartment.
Really?
What about his weekend place in Lake Arrowhead?
Ralph, enough.
Why don't we end our lesson for today?
Okay.
Then I guess I'll see you tomorrow, Albert.
Your name is Albert?
You never told me your name is Albert.
You never asked.
That's not fair.
I assumed your name was Quizmaster and the fact that it was also your job just was a happy accident.
You haven't changed one bit.
You're never willing to admit you're wrong.
What?
I'm the one who keeps apologising to you.
- Just admit it.
You need me.
- You're dreaming.
I've moved on.
In fact, I found a new quizmaster and I've never been happier.
Well, me too.
Ralph is the best student I've ever had.
He can even turn himself into uranium.
Okay, I'm radioactive now, but the point is, he can do it.
So?
I've learned all the elements and passed my midterm with flying colours.
Really?
No!
She so wanted me.
I've got it!
I know why I need my quizmaster back now.
You know, you can't just barge in here assuming we have nothing to do.
Proceed.
Okay, well, he and I just got into this huge fight and I'm hurt and angry, and I never wanna see him again.
Don't you see?
We're friends.
Miss Spellman, does this dysfunctional story have a point?
Well, I didn't realise we were friends before, and that's why I need him.
I mean, when I think about all the times we've shared together     So that's why I need my quizmaster back with me.
Because nothing makes a better teacher than a friend.
Wow.
Nope!
Cool, that's the seventh time today.
Thanks for your help, Libby.
Sorry.
I'm the only person in class who still hasn't figured it out.
Don't think our foreign exchange student has gotten it either.
Way to go, Lajos.
Maybe I've used up my brain, it's just not gonna function anymore and it's going to sit on the top of my neck and get softer and softer until the weight of my hair crushes it and I have to wear a hat around.
You could work on the problem some more.
I just feel like such a dunce.
Hi, Sabrina.
Did you dress yourself today?
Yes, I dressed myself, and someday I hope to be able to feed myself.
That's right.
And how do we feed ourselves?
With a spoon.
Parrots also play tennis.
Can you?
Sabrina, you have a very special chemistry assignment today.
You get to clap the erasers.
Okay, but I feel kind of silly.
Oh.
Look, everyone.
Look how well Sabrina claps the erasers.
Sabrina likes to clap erasers.
Sabrina likes to clap erasers.
Sabrina.
Sabrina.
Don't make me touch.
What do you want, Libby?
Your aunt asked me to help with your experiment.
- What?
- Yes.
And I'm going to need to know a few things about you before we begin.
Do you know how to add and subtract?
- I don't need your help, Libby.
- Yes, you do.
In many, many ways.
- Go away!
- Not until--  What?
What's that, Libby?
I-- Sorry, I can't understand you?
Freeze!
Sabrina, what's going on?
You know Libby, my mortal enemy?
The albatross around my neck?
- That stinky-faced meanie?
- Yes.
That's the Libby you've become friends with.
And now you've asked her to be my tutor?
- Honey, I simply-- - Wanted to publicly humiliate me?
I mean, I understand.
Why not?
I can't figure out this chemistry problem and I can't even think about trying to pass my elements test.
Man, it would feel great to just disappear.
All right!
Tornado in the house.
Oh, cool.
It's you.
I was about to put on a sweater.
Wait.
There's an encore.
- Way to go.
- Oh.
I knew you could do it.
Hey, it's a letter from the Witches' Council.
I passed my elements test.
Hey, maybe I should go into teaching.
Heh-heh.
Wow, I freed up my mind and things just clicked.
Aunt Zelda, I now understand the chemistry problem.
When the copper is being oxidized, the hydrogen is being reduced.
Oh, thank goodness I don't have to fail you.
Wow, I can't remember when I felt so good.
Yes, I do.
It was with the quizmaster.
That bonehead.
Still waiting for someone to say, "Yeah, Hilda, you should go into teaching".
And that's why I need my quizmaster back.
I mean, he's the one who guides me.
Because of him, I know the joy of learning.
And if that's not it, I'm out of ideas.
No, you got it right.
We're discussing dinner plans.
- He can be your quizmaster again.
- Whoo-hoo!
Bet you're pretty impressed I figured it out, huh?
No.
Most witches get it right away.
You took so long, we actually started an office pool.
Who had Sabrina Wednesday at 3?
Everybody, pay the man.
There's something very wrong with you people.
I don't want to bother you.
I know you're probably quizzing the amazing Ralph.
No, no, no, it's okay.
Hold on.
Ralph, Sabrina and I need to talk.
Give us a few minutes, okay?
No problem, chief.
- Great kid.
Yeah.
I just wanted to let you know that I passed my elements test.
- All right!
- Yeah.
You were right, I wasn't learning because all I could do was think about getting it wrong.
Heh.
I'm proud of you, but I think I should get back to quizzing Ralph, so-- Right.
You know what?
Actually, I've been kind of rude to Ralph.
I should apologise.
Ralph!
Ralph's not here.
I've been throwing my voice.
And may I ask why?
I'm not tutoring Ralph anymore.
I broke it off.
But he was the perfect student.
I know, it was so annoying.
Well, I missed you and the way you always loathed seeing me.
I think maybe I got self-esteem issues.
This is great.
I mean, not your self-hatred.
The Witches' Council said that you can quiz me again.
- That is, if you want to.
- Of course I want to.
Great.
You know, I'll deny this under oath, but I missed you.
- I knew it.
- Heh.
I missed you too.
Great.
Well All right, see you later, okay?
- Albert?
- Yeah.
Let's just stick with Quizmaster, okay?
And, down there, that's where I went to elementary school.
Wow, almost as exciting as where you bought your toothpaste.
Wait, you're the one who thought it'd be fun to take a hot-air balloon ride.
It was more fun in my imagination.
I don't know why.
I'm having a great time.
Whoever brought the Brie, thank you.
Let's get out of here.
I've had my fill of talking vermin.
She so wants me.
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
What is this obsession you young people have with joy?
I blame the media.
Well, final examinations are just around the corner, young man, and you cannot afford to waste one minute on this hedonistic frolicking.
Oh Maybe I should study.
I didn't understand a word he said.
Buy a candy bar to help with the janitor's hip replacement?
Aren't you trespassing on government property?
No.
I'm here to inform you that you can expect a very big witch exam sometime soon.
Does it involve changing the Earth's orbit?
Because the last time I tried that a little thing called El NiÃ±o happened.
Well, I can't tell you when, but I can tell you where.
I don't know why they can't accept the misery that should be their lives.
Class trip to Florida.
We're going to Disney World!
Put them up!
Put them up!
Put up your feet and watch our show.
I am so glad we're chaperoning this trip to Disney World.
I love Splash Mountain more than life itself.
What's your favourite part?
There's a paleontological dig at the new Animal Kingdom Theme Park, and it just sounds fascinating.
Only you could make the happiest place on earth sound dry and clinical.
I like bones.
They're fake.
Disney?
Remember?
I know that.
But I also happen to know that the area was inhabited by real dinosaurs at one time.
If they were alive today, they'd ride the rides.
Well, we should get to the airport.
Salem, we're leaving.
Don't forget to feed the cat.
Ha, ha.
I love saying that.
Ha-ha-ha.
Where is the cat, anyway?
Well, it's 9:00.
He's probably upstairs watching Regis.
I can't believe we're here.
This is so exciting.
Ha.
I know.
You think Mr. Kraft has a brain lesion?
Why is it that cool people never show any emotion?
I mean, no matter how great the situation, - they never seem like they have fun.
- I know.
Why can't I be like them?
Because you have blood in your veins.
From now on I'm gonna be cool.
I'm gonna hide how much fun I'm having.
Uh, Room 346: Spellman and Birkhead.
- You are roommates.
- Yes, yes, yes!
Yes.
Don't do that.
I wish I were a cool person so I could make fun of me right now.
So I told Harvey we'd meet him in front of the Tree of Life.
Okay.
Then we should go to Harambe, Africa.
It's in the deepest, darkest part of the continent.
- Right next to the gift shop.
Heh.
- Heh.
Room service.
- I didn't order anything, did you?
- No.
- Hey.
- Oh, wait, I did order something.
Um You know what?
Why don't, um, you go ahead, and I'll meet up with you and Harvey right after I finish my liquorice.
Okay.
- I only like red.
- Who said it's for you?
Now, okay, here's your exam: You're on a survival mission.
You have to brew a potion capable of turning yourself into an animal, and another potion that will turn you back.
I already know how to do that.
You have to do it without the use of your finger.
Okay, now you're not getting a tip.
It's in case you're lost in an unknown land, your fingers are broken, and you need to become an animal in order to survive.
How many witches has this happened to before?
One.
And Slow Bob has never been the same since.
Now, here's your list of required ingredients.
Mostly plants.
Tropical plants, - which would explain Florida.
- Exactly.
Now, you only have until the end of today to complete this critical test.
You fail it, and you won't get your witch's license.
That means no rides.
Great.
Well, why don't you just take me to Paris and not let me eat the food?
This is amazing.
This tree has 325 animals carved into it.
One of them looks like Ed Asner.
I wonder where Sabrina is.
How much room-service liquorice did she order?
Never mind.
Hey, Harvey.
You sure look nice today.
- Thanks.
- Especially by comparison.
Libby, the Jungle Cruise wants its shrunken head back.
Oh, I'm sorry, that's your actual head.
How does it feel being unpopular in a tropical setting?
So ready to explore?
Actually, there's been a little change on that front.
See, I suddenly realised that I forgot to do a report on plants for science.
I'm in that class.
We don't have a report.
Did I say plants for science?
I meant government.
I'll just do a little foraging and catch up with you later, okay?
See you.
I'm in that class too.
Okay.
So we'll spend at the dinosaur place, and then the rest of the day on the rides, right?
That's not the plan, and you know it.
Well, it should be.
Uh, excuse me, but aren't you two forgetting something?
Salem, we're still mad at you for stowing away.
You are not going anywhere.
Besides, cats aren't even allowed in the park.
W-- What?
Oh, we'll try to bring you a souvenir.
Yeah.
I think it's time you started collecting spoons.
I should have known Disney wouldn't be cat-friendly.
Why else would the star attraction be a giant mouse?
Housekeeping.
Fried park food, here I come.
Ms. Spellman.
Do you mind telling me what you are doing trespassing on park property?
Uh, looking for the ice machine?
Heh.
Do you realise that instead of standing here in the hot sun, we could actually be flying through the air on Space Mountain, barfing our guts out?
Oh, my gosh.
Look what I just found.
Styrofoam from the late '80s?
No.
It's a real bone from some sort of beast.
I've just discovered the femur of a creature that lived millions of years ago.
Wow.
You can't top that.
So let's stop trying.
Sabrina?
Still looking for the ice machine?
Uh, nope.
Found it.
Delicious.
Far be it for me to question the Walt Disney corporation, but that does not seem convenient.
This kind of discovery could put me in the history books.
Are you going to alert the media?
No.
I'm going to get bug spray.
Although a mosquito bite is starting to sound exciting.
Have you noticed that Sabrina is nowhere to be seen, and Harvey's all alone?
Well, except for that girl.
- Valerie?
- Whatever.
Girls.
I think it's time I made my move on him.
I'll just hang around awkward little Valerie and work my magic on Harvey.
GIRLS : Go for it.
Hey, guys.
Not if I work my magic first.
You can't make a move on him if you can't find him.
Where did Harvey go?
Where did he go?
Karibuni.
I'm Harvey, and I'll be your guide as we tour the Harambe Wildlife Reserve.
Keep your arms inside the vehicle, and enjoy the ride.
And if anyone has a pacemaker or smells like fresh meat, let me know.
You sure you don't know where Harvey is?
Trust me.
I'd rather be wherever he is, than standing here uncomfortably waiting for him.
Hey, maybe he went to the riverboat ride.
That's what we planned to do next.
Well, great.
I'll come with you.
- But I'll be there.
- Heh.
That's okay.
- We can all share a seat.
- Really?
Try to remain calm.
Whatever.
Hey, wait up!
There you are, you little star aster.
Sabrina, I have had just about enough of these shenanigans.
Now-- You'd think they'd have more bathrooms around here.
Hey.
Want to see the personalised souvenir mug I got you?
They didn't have "Zelda" so I got "Pam".
I've got to find out more about this bone.
Of this bone There is much in doubt So of yourself Tell me all about That poem is so bad you could get a grant.
Ah, ah, ah, ah.
Hey, it talks.
My prehistoric's a little rusty.
Can you make out what it's saying?
I think it means "bone cold".
Well, now we know the phrase "duh" dates back to prehistoric times.
That was so scary.
I know.
I was sure we were gonna crash and die at the Dragon Rocks.
Really?
You covered it well with your screaming.
Where's Harvey?
That's amazing.
I was just wondering the same thing.
We are now approaching hippo river.
The hippopotamuses are among the most aggressive animals in the jungle.
Fortunately, our Harambe therapists are working with the hippos to channel that anger.
I hope this is the way to the frozen-banana stand.
Heh.
What's that?
Big pink bird!
Don't panic.
Remain calm.
Everything's under control.
Nothing to be afraid of  Run away!
Hey, after it stops raining let's go to the African village.
We can get our picture taken with a real-life poacher.
- Great.
- Hey, Valerie and Libby.
Where's Harvey?
Don't you know where he is?
I thought he was your good friend.
Oh.
Yeah, of course I know where he is.
I mean, he's obviously staying away from you.
Why are you hanging out with her?
- She wanted to hang out with me.
- No, seriously, why?
Because she wanted to.
- Wow.
You are serious.
Yeah.
Wanna come?
No, I haven't finished my report yet.
Some jerk with a leaf blower came by, and I lost half my work.
Hmm.
Maybe I should give him more consciousness.
Zelda, do the words "going overboard" mean anything to you?
Oh.
Quickly, Hilda, what's he saying?
Uh, his name is Tootie, and he wants to know if you stole his nanwama, which is either "shoes" or "wife".
Oh-- Uh-oh, we're beginning to attract attention.
We better take him back to the hotel room so we can study him further.
All right, but you're asking the management for the rollaway bed.
Witch-hazel, shaved coconut.
I hope it doesn't matter I got it from the ice-cream stand.
Palm frond--   Help!
Let me in!
Oh  Salem, what's wrong?
I just narrowly escaped death by winged beast.
- No, you didn't.
- I'm telling you, I was savagely attacked by a pterodactyl.
Is that decaf?
No.
It's the first potion for my quiz.
I need more plants for the second potion, but I thought I'd brew up this batch first.
Hi.
- So where's Libby?
- In the lobby.
You two think you're gonna be hanging out the rest of the day?
Probably.
Is that so strange?
A little.
I think she's up to something.
Oh, I guess she couldn't be hanging out with me on the off chance that she likes me.
I mean, no way I could ever be popular.
So now you're seeing my point.
I'm trying to look out for you.
By insulting me?
Look, you just can't admit that I have the ability to be cool.
And I do.
I'm being cool right now.
Well, I'm just saying that I wouldn't trust Libby.
But if you want to, fine.
I have more foraging to do.
She brought her cat?
Hi.
Ooh.
Fresh-brewed tea.
I bet Libby would love some iced tea.
Not a good idea.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a school-funded field trip, not an excuse to have fun.
Oh, I almost forgot.
I got us some iced tea.
I think it's herbal.
Valerie, where is Harvey?
- I don't know.
- You keep saying that.
It's because I keep not knowing.
No, ma'am, the impalas we're going to see are antelopes with red coats, not American-made sedans with front-wheel drive.
What about the falcons?
Yes, it's the same situation with the falcons.
Hey, let's visit the Gorilla Falls Trail.
Iced tea?
- Ew.
- Sorry.
Ugh.
The only reason I'm even standing close to you is-- Those zebras aren't supposed to Oh, get a hold of yourself, Willard.
Uh-oh.
"Property of Sabrina Spellman".
I knew it.
This weird trip, that ice machine, those zebras.
I I-- I have a sick headache.
Mm.
Ah, macadamia nuts from the minibar.
Especially tasty when they're your third jar and someone else is paying for them.
Some squirrels broke in.
I'm just tidying up.
Back so soon?
Yeah, I-- I still need one more plant for my second potion, but I came back to see if Valerie was still here so I could apologise.
What happened to my potion?
Oh.
Valerie took it.
And you didn't stop her?
Yeah, I'm gonna put down an overpriced chocolate bar just to yell at Valerie.
Get real.
Salem, this potion turns people into animals.
People into animals?
Why am I finding it hard to summon sympathy?
I've gotta get it back.
Room service.
Someone order carp, carp and more carp?
Yo.
Oh, this is the opportunity of a lifetime.
A chance to study a prehistoric creature close-up.
Yeah, I have to admit I am enjoying it.
- Really?
- Now I'm done.
I wanna plummet down the Tower of Terror, and I wanna plummet now.
What's he saying?
- Log flume.
Log flume.
- Oh, he is not.
Oh, he's hungry.
And I would like to point out that he wouldn't be hungry if you would turn him back into a bone.
I'll zap in some food.
I'm thinking anything tartare.
Wait a minute.
I don't wanna make him sick.
Maybe I'd better go back to where we found him and analyze the soil so we can get his diet right.
Give him a nut from the honour bar and see if he can keep it down.
Keep an eye on him.
Are you kidding?
A looker like that?
Take it easy.
Take it easy.
I'm upset that the hotel doesn't provide robes too, but you don't see me tearing the room apart.
Valerie?
Valerie?
Lose something?
My brew-- I mean, my bottle.
Where'd you find it?
Oddly enough, next to two wandering zebras.
You didn't happen to notice which way they went?
No, why?
Oh, because, uh-- I'm looking for Valerie, and I happen to know she's a real zebra fanatic.
- Uh-huh.
- It's a real problem.
There are no support groups.
Gotta go.
That girl is lying.
There are support groups for everything.
I guess this disproves one theory: Music doesn't soothe the savage beast, Petticoat Junction does.
Yeah, Uncle Joe is moving kind of slow.
Aunt Hilda, I need help.
Libby and Valerie accidentally spilled my potion, and now they've become zebras.
Huh.
You think that's bad.
I once accidentally turned the entire USC marching band into garter snakes.
I need a clamshell orchid for the turn-back potion.
All right, don't panic.
This is not a problem.
Clamshell orchid.
What's it shaped like?
Oh, of course.
Tootie used to live here.
He can help us.
- And he is?
- A 2-million-year-old fossil that Zelda found, brought to life and evolved so he can speak.
I can't remember what it feels like to be astonished.
All right, let's go.
Okay, and remember, no grooming the passersby.
Ape before beauty.
The black rhino you see on your left is named Tiffany.
Tiffany's turn-ons include volleyball and Judith Krantz novels.
Her turn-offs are war and people who smoke.
No, sir, she's not waving at you.
Oh, he says there's probably a clamshell orchid over there.
Well, well, well, Ms. Spellman, are we looking for a Mickey Mouse topiary to pull apart?
No, but thanks for asking.
- You have something behind you.
- Probably not.
Oh, hello, Hilda.
Hello-- Oh, my-- Who is this?
Uh, Aunt Hilda's new boyfriend, Tootie Goldberg.
- He's Swedish.
- And he's dying to see The Lion King show, so we'd better go get seats.
Heh.
See you.
Boy, Swedes do not do well in warm weather.
Okay, the clamshell orchid's in.
Let's hope this works.
I don't think being a zebra is gonna help Valerie's self-esteem.
Okay, what have we learned?
We've learned that 14 shrimp cocktails should not be accompanied by an entire shepherd's pie.
I swear, Mr. Kraft, I have no idea how I got there - or why my mouth tastes like grass.
- Me neither.
Well, I have an idea or two.
I think it might have something to do with a certain obsessive-compulsive disorder that one of you has with zebras.
- Huh?
- I want you to know, I was just trying to save her from herself.
What?
I never doubted that for a minute, Libby.
Before she went crazy, the last thing I remember was me saying I thought it would be educational if we rode the safari ride.
But we never got there.
I'm on my way there right now.
Would you care to join me?
I'd love to, Mr. Kraft.
Obsession with zebras?
Val, are you okay?
- I think.
- Good.
Okay, let's go find Zelda.
- Are we okay?
- Yeah.
Look, I-- I'm sorry I got sucked into Libby's sphere, and I'm sorry I didn't listen to you.
You were right.
Libby doesn't like me.
What tipped you off?
I don't know.
I just have this strong feeling she'd fight me over a salt lick.
I don't know why.
And I have to admit, I was a little jealous because you were being friendly with Libby.
You were?
Wow!
I've never made anyone jealous before.
Okay, I'm done savouring the moment.
- Let's go ride something.
- Great.
Hey, who was that smelly man with your aunt?
Yes, prehistoric creatures ate a bean very similar to our lima.
Somehow you find that interesting.
Hello, girls.
Where's Harvey?
- Where is Harvey?
- I thought you knew.
Uh-oh.
That concludes our trip through the Harambe reserve.
Make sure you take all your belongings with you.
And to that couple who taunted the mandrills, that stuff will come out with a little club soda.
Harvey Kinkle, do you know where you are?
Mr. Kraft.
Yes.
I'm near a termite mound that antelopes use as a lookout post.
Help me!
Harvey, where have you been?
I don't know.
I'm kind of tired, my throat's sore, and I'm suddenly very disdainful of the way America dresses.
Speaking of which, weren't we forbidden to do missionary work on this trip?
I've gotta stop letting my mom pack for me.
- I'm thirsty.
- Yeah.
Hey, you got any more of that iced tea?
Nope.
Gone, gone, gone.
Gone.
Three lemonades, please.
- Right away.
- Hey, you should work here.
You can wear your own clothes.
If I wasn't working for the mouse, I'd slap you.
So how'd I do?
Well, you passed the survival test.
Now all you have to do is spend the night alone in Antarctica.
- You're kidding.
- Heh.
As a matter of fact, I am.
It's a week.
Eh?
Yeow.
Man, I crack myself up.
So, what happened to Tootie?
- Did you turn him back into a bone?
- Oh, we couldn't do that to him.
We cleaned him up, taught him some English and found a place for him.
Hi.
Uh, large fruit punch, please.
- Ice?
- Yeah, sure.
No ice.
Do I know you?
Ice?
I don't know how long you've known Hilda, but, uh, she seem at all strange to you?
Like doing weird things you can't--  Uh-- Well, no, I mean above and beyond simply being a woman.
Heh.
So Sweden, huh?
Wow.
You must be pretty proud of the way you guys did down in Nagano.
I-- I have a good dentist we could, uh, maybe send you to.
Yeah, well, there would be some gum surgery, no question about that.
I've always liked the paintings of Edvard Munch, who's, uh, Swedish.
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
Great.
Friday afternoon.
No one around.
Levitation spell.
Follow me.
Heavy reading.
It looked like your book bag was just floating behind you.
Ha, ha, wouldn't I love that?
But I All right, that's the last time I buy Minoxidil out of somebody's trunk.
Giddyap.
Oh, I need a horse.
Hey, guess what.
I was the 23rd caller to the radio station and I won two tickets to the Lisa Loeb concert this weekend.
You're kidding.
I've devoted my life to being the 23rd caller.
But I'm a purist.
I never use speed dial.
So you wanna go?
They're great seats.
You mean we can actually see the band?
- I can't.
- Why?
Well, I went out twice last week and I sort of promised my aunts I'd stay in and do some schoolwork.
It's not like I have a lot.
Heh.
The seats are right next to the speakers.
Oh, man.
That's where the fights usually break out.
Never puts anything away.
Leaves mail everywhere.
I don't want to know.
You need something?
You in a better mood?
Oh, I'm just irritated with Hilda.
Sometimes I feel like I'm living with a small child.
Except this child can reach the high cabinets.
You know, maybe you should talk to her.
Uh, and I think it would be best if I wasn't around.
And amazingly enough, Harvey is willing to take me away to a concert.
Oh, you wanna know the time.
Friday at 9.
Didn't you say you were gonna stay home this weekend?
Possibly.
Didn't you say you had a lot of work to do?
You're paraphrasing, but yes.
And didn't you promise not to even ask permission to go somewhere?
Heh, that Aunt Hilda's a real pain, huh?
I went to a bad movie and a 99-cent store with Valerie and for that I have to miss a free concert?
Oh, I'll feel sorry for you tonight when I'm sleeping in my wicker basket by those old paint cans.
I can't believe Zelda.
Where does she get off holding me to what I agreed to?
What is that famous expression?
"If at first you don't succeed, try another aunt".
- Doesn't sound very honest.
- You want honest or do you wanna go out and bleed from your ears with Harvey?
- Lose something?
- My mind, possibly.
I bought a new pair of shoes.
I left them on this table for 10 seconds, and now they're gone.
I'd say they didn't walk off by themselves, but in this house it could happen.
I know what happened: Zelda.
She's a compulsive neat freak.
Back during the plague, she used to get upset if people didn't leave their dead in neat, tidy rows.
Speaking of neat, Harvey won these incredible concert tickets.
- Wow.
- I thought I should ask permission.
Hey, you know my motto: life's short and-- Wait a minute.
Did you talk to the queen of clean about this?
Aunt Zelda?
Well, sort of.
She was busy complaining about how messy you are.
That woman.
I'll bet she said no.
No.
She did not say no.
Well, then, note your exits and bring me a T-shirt.
All right.
Thanks, Aunt Hilda.
- Can you hear?
- What?
Can you hear?
- I only brought a dollar.
- What?
Good night, Sabrina.
- Sabrina.
- Still up?
I'll take that as a yes.
Who brewed the storm?
Hey, how was the concert?
You knew she was going?
Yeah.
I told her that she could go.
Should I not have?
- You said she didn't say no.
- Which was true.
Technically.
I see what happened here.
You didn't like my answer, so you went behind my back to my irresponsible sister.
What?
I am just as responsible as you are.
Hey, I'm trying to sleep.
Why can't you act like a normal family and argue on the front lawn?
Hilda, if you were really responsible, Sabrina would not have gone to that concert.
If you weren't a stick-in-the-mud, she wouldn't have had to come to me.
If I'm stuck in the mud, it's because of the mess you make.
Door.
Thanks.
I was just gonna get that.
So if there's no new business, then that concludes this meeting of the Science Club.
Oh, uh, uh, I know this is non-Science Club business, but uh, I was just wondering.
Uh, my parents are going away for the weekend, and, you know, we have that big-screen TV, and the indoor pool-- Empty-house party!
Great.
Why can't Gordie's parents have a couples-therapy weekend when I'm not grounded?
Hey, did you hear about Gordie's party?
I bet the cops will be there before 10.
- I can't go.
- You have to go.
You'll have nothing in common with the entire student body if you don't go.
I mean, I'll still like you, but I don't think we'll have anything to talk about.
- No.
- Oh, but everyone's going.
I even think the custodial staff is coming.
No.
No fun.
But this isn't fun.
It's a matter of survival.
If I don't go, I'll be president of the Geeks Anonymous, only I won't be anonymous.
Then I hope God grants you the serenity to know that my answer is something you can't change.
So you went home during lunch?
Your Aunt Hilda's still saying no?
Now she's moved on to "No way" and "Ask again and you'll never see sunlight".
Hi, Harvey.
Sabrina, I heard Ellen Healy can't go to the party either, so she's transferring to another school.
It's just a dumb party.
Right.
And New Year's Eve, 1999 will be just another night of hats and horns.
But don't worry, I'll be there to keep Harvey company.
This party will be so big, she'll never find me.
Where is my carbolic acid?
Hilda.
I can't ask Aunt Zelda to let me go to that party.
- Do it.
Do it.
- Okay, I'm going in.
- Aunt Zelda?
- Yes?
Uh, I'll make this quick.
Uh, the president of the Science Club is having a - What?
What?
- The Science Club.
Oh, I love the Science Club.
I wish your Aunt Hilda had had more science.
I think it makes a person organised.
Oh, well, I tried to talk to her about this, but-- Pfft.
She grew distracted by something shiny?
Ha-ha-ha.
That's a good one, Aunt Zelda.
You're pretty funny.
Well, you can tell me.
I love science.
Okay, well, um, see, this Saturday, the Science Club is having a special-- Meeting?
Yes.
People will be meeting.
Well, you go, then.
Women in science, Sabrina.
That's the future.
You go.
And you be the brightest one there.
Um Okay.
Aren't you glad you didn't miss this party?
What?
Hello, Sabrina.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
But before you ground me again, I think you should know that the trend these days is to factor in time served.
What are you gonna do to me?
Under the circumstances-- The only thing we can do.
- You're throwing me out?
- No.
I'm moving out.
This is a very odd punishment.
You guys can't split up.
Well, look at what's happened.
We're not good parents together.
This is all my fault.
Nonsense.
You're just one of a multitude of things we disagree on.
I've already picked out a lovely townhouse.
I loathe townhouses.
See?
We even disagree on that.
You'll come stay with me this weekend.
- Well, see you, Zeldy.
- Bye, Hildy.
I can't believe this happened.
I can't believe you tricked me into letting you go to that party.
Well, now that Aunt Hilda's gone, why don't we just blame it all on her and call it a night?
Ha.
Welcome to Chez Hilda.
It didn't look like this when I moved in.
I did a little remodelling with magic.
You are aware this looks exactly like Aunt Zelda's place?
It's the exact opposite.
Plus, I added a doily.
I hate it.
Come on, I'll show you your room.
How can you hate it?
It's just like home.
Because I hate change, and it smells like sweat and spit.
- That's you.
- Oh.
- Oh, hi.
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?
- Just checking out your new digs.
Can't quiz you if I can't find you.
Mind if I, uh, use your shower?
Go ahead.
Just don't use my razor again.
Hurry up and unpack.
I'll take you to school, and then I'll get ready for the party.
- Party?
- Yeah.
I'm having a housewarming.
I'll need to zap in chips, decorations, guests I better go make a list.
Don't forget the quinine water.
Fun party?
Could this get any worse.
Oh, come on.
Sure, it's a little weird, but, you know, moving between two houses has its upside.
I hear travel broadens you.
I'm a latchkey kitty.
- Hey.
- Hey, that's my lunch.
I have a message for you.
You're summoned to a meeting of the Witches' Council.
Mr. Kraft, I wanted to run an idea by you.
Mm-hm.
- Reserved seating in the cafeteria.
But-- Here's the best part: only for cheerleaders.
Now?
But I'm at--  Fascinating.
I'll have to get back to you on that.
My ex-wife is behind this.
I just know it.
Why am I here?
Oh, parking ticket?
Beheading?
I didn't ask.
This custody hearing regarding Sabrina Spellman will come to order.
But I'm already in custody.
My parents turned my witch training over to my aunts and I live with them.
But your aunts are kaput.
The Witches' Council insists you reside in only one household.
- Why?
- Check Article 12, Section 15.
Because you say so?
Now, you have to choose which aunt you wish to live with.
This choice will affect the rest of your life, so choose wisely.
Okay, who's it gonna be?
You want me to decide now?
You've lived with them for over a year.
You must have a favourite by now.
So spill it.
I got a squash game.
I don't have a favourite.
I love both.
This is a court of law.
This is not a greeting-card company.
We'll reconvene later for your decision.
Ready?
- You're going down this time, man.
- Come on.
Come on.
Come on, then.
Oh, that's it?
No help?
I hope you both get squash elbow.
Whoo.
Oh, my-- This-- That's-- You-- You should-- Whee!
So, Sabrina, I trust you've made up your mind which aunt to live with?
I can't decide.
I guess we'll just have to forget the whole thing.
We should grant you a "What if"?
spell.
What's a "What if"?
It allows you to look into the future and see what might happen if, say, you never brushed your teeth.
Or if dogs took shorthand.
I see, like, what if Kenan and Kel won the lottery?
Where did you put the ticket?
- What?
What are you doing?
- I got hungry.
Keep looking.
Oh, oh!
Oh, yes.
Hey, Kel.
Kel, man, I found the ticket, Kel.
Hey, Kel.
Man, I found the ticket--  Bite?
Okay, let me try a "what if"?
- Uh, what if--?
- Excuse me.
This is the remote.
We've gone digital.
Okay, let me try again.
Uh, what if I went to live with Aunt Hilda?
Harvey.
Hey.
Grab some wheels.
Let's go mountain biking up the stairs.
No, thanks.
I just wondered what happened to you.
Oh, right.
We were supposed to get married.
- I figured you forgot.
- No, no, no.
You gave me a licence to sign.
It's around here somewhere.
Oh, here it is.
Sorry about the gum.
- It's not too late, is it?
- Yeah.
I gave you that three years ago.
Man, I'm so disorganized.
Well, you're here now.
Let me grab my coat.
Sabrina, I've moved on.
I married someone else.
- And you didn't call?
- I did.
You told me you'd call me back after you finished your game of "Tetris".
How's that going, by the way?
Look, I came here because I wanted you to meet my wife.
Honey?
All right, she's alive.
- Can we go now?
- You wanna meet our little one?
Ew.
Okay, that's not good.
I don't thing I need to see if I choose Aunt Zelda.
Let's assume that it'd be better than that.
Never assume.
Two parts citric acid, one part noodles--  Sabrina?
- Come on in, Libby.
I've come for my weekly supply of your anti-aging cream.
Sure.
Here you go.
- What do you say?
- Sabrina's the best.
I'm a freak.
Okay, I'm helping mankind and keeping Libby on a short leash.
There's more.
Sabrina.
- Come in, Mr. Kraft.
I've come for my weekly jar of anti-aging cream.
Here you go.
Thanks so much for letting me be a part of your experiment.
Now, you be honest to me, now.
I'm in the placebo group, aren't I?
Not necessarily.
You could be part of Group C. They're getting aging cream.
- Uh-uh.
- But probably not.
If you were, you'd have suffered some loss of hearing.
Oh, thank you very much.
I just got these shoes.
Okay, well, see you next week.
Hopefully.
Say hi to Sabrina if you see her.
So my science is going well, but it looks like I'm still alone.
Sabrina, could you hand me my book if you're not busy?
Great.
Harvey and I are together.
I'm definitely voting for Aunt Zelda.
No problem, honey.
You know, as soon as I finish these next 49 experiments I'm gonna find out not just how but why you dissolved.
No rush, but I would like to be let out of the anti-aging experiment.
- Why?
- Because I think it's keeping me alive.
You've seen both scenarios.
What is your decision?
Well, I definitely don't want to live with Kenan and Kel.
- I don't know.
- I'll give you one more day, but that's it.
If you haven't made a decision by then, I'll be forced to pick for you.
And I'm thinking orphanage.
Salem, what am I gonna do?
I can't just choose one.
I have to find a way to get Aunt Hilda and Aunt Zelda back together.
Is there a spell that would force them to share a spleen?
Okay.
How about if I find something that they both love and cherish and put it in danger?
Oh, what are you gonna do to me?
Not you.
Me.
Oh, thank goodness.
But I am willing to help.
I could push you down the stairs.
Aunt Hilda?
Aunt Hilda, I think I might be sick.
That makes two of us.
Oh, let's get you to Zelda.
Crisis management is not my strong suit.
Do you mind riding in the back?
Well, the good news is no lice.
The bad news: not even enough hair for a decent combover.
Aunt Hilda, will you stay the night with me?
Yes, honey.
Do you mind, Zelda?
Oh, not at all.
I'd appreciate it.
I'm gonna go make you some nice noodle soup.
I put that under C, for chicken.
Or was it P, for poultry?
I'd better help.
Salem, it's working.
They'll be back together in no time.
I've been sizing up their spleens just in case.
Thank you for coming so quickly.
We need a specialist.
No, they called the doctor!
I was against this plan from the beginning.
I thought she was a specialist.
She is.
A specialist in hairdressing.
- She thinks you have a follicle problem.
- I think my brain might be sweating.
Ah.
Are we in the neighbourhood?
No!
It's horrible!
Oh, well, listen, don't worry.
It can be fixed.
Listen, I'm gonna need a bucket of ice, some antiseptic ointment, and I need Sabrina to sign a release form.
And, uh, why don't you turn up the stereo?
It helps drown out the screams.
Stop.
I can fix it myself.
- Would restraints help?
- It was a spell.
I was trying to get you guys back together because I don't like us not being a family anymore.
You did what?
Look, if I were sick, could I do this:  Okay, so I'm no Ken Berry.
Sabrina, we have a confession to make.
We didn't really split up.
Okay, you live in two different houses because?
We pretended to split up to help you learn that we're better parents as a unit.
You shouldn't pit us against one another.
You couldn't tell me this before because?
We did, and you responded by sneaking off to the Science Club party.
And I have no response for that because-- - You know we're right.
- But why did the cat have to suffer?
Wait, this couldn't have been a ruse.
I mean, I was called before the Witches' Council.
And we were happy to help.
It's been a slow month, and I've got teenagers at home.
Talk about your full-service organisation.
And now, if you'll excuse me, I've gotta go deal with a little boy who won't wash behind his ears.
This time, I get to be a matador.
Well, I've certainly learned my lesson.
But are we all aware that he did not fix my hair?
And now aren't you glad you're grounded?
Oh, thank you for returning Sabrina's book.
Oh, no problem.
You know, it's kind of funny.
My grandmother's been wanting me to see someone.
I'm sure you'll meet someone nice when you least expect it.
No, this is "see someone" as in psychiatrist.
Although admittedly, I have been seeing quite a few strange things here and there.
Mostly here.
I don't know what you're referring to.
Well, strange sparkly things and paper dissolving and staircase slides and a townhouse that looks identical to this Victorian home.
Oh, you don't need a psychiatrist.
You just have a wonderfully active imagination.
You probably feel so free to let yourself go around us because we're so relaxed and comforting.
- And normal.
- Good, so we're normal.
Oh, quit complaining, Salem.
I think you look cute.
- Anything else?
- I-- No.
I'm not happy.
{END OF EPISODE 24}{START OF EPISODE 25}
- You started your report yet?
- Almost.
Everyone knows a good paper's your highlighters.
Well, if and when you do start it, at least you'll have a nice, quiet place to work in.
Zelda and I are gonna take a trip.
Is that a euphemism for "plastic surgery"?
We haven't decided where we're vacationing, although Hilda is pushing for Atlantis.
The kelp is in full bloom.
Will you be all right alone while we're away?
Are you kidding?
I've never had the house to myself.
Gotta call Val.
Ow.
Right after I finish my paper.
- Such a good girl.
- And so trustworthy.
What a coincidence.
The topic of my paper is child abuse.
Let them eat cake, but save me some.
You need a hand with those?
- No, thanks.
I got them.
Huh!
Do you mind?
Check this out.
"Time-space continuum excursions.
Three days, two nights".
And you come back younger.
Oh, let's try something really different.
"The third ring of Saturn.
Now with single-deck blackjack".
Let's go see the world's largest - ball of twine.
- Twine?
One question.
Why?
And please let the answer be that you have a fever.
Twine?
Is that the brochure?
And, if so, can I keep it in my basket?
Come on, Hilda, we always go to the Other Realm, but we never get to see any real Americana.
At least tell me it's somewhere exotic.
It's in Kansas.
Oh, the Paris of the Midwest.
Do you think this knapsack would accommodate a substantial ball of twine?
- Why?
- Just asking.
Oh, great.
It's the Green Hornet.
So how's the report coming?
I have every reason to believe it will garner a fine grade.
- You still haven't started yet.
- Nope.
Well, it's gonna be tough now that you have to sign up for community service in the Other Realm.
What?
But I didn't do anything wrong.
Community service isn't just something pro athletes do to avoid jail time.
In the Other Realm, giving back to the community makes you feel good about yourself.
But I already feel fabulous about myself.
I love me.
If you want your witch's licence, you do charity work, and you have to give it your all.
You can't just phone it in.
Okay, get off my back.
I'll help others.
Let's go.
Sorry.
You have to do it on your own.
Fine.
- What's this?
- My homework.
Give it your all.
And don't just phone it in.
Oh, man, Walden?
Nothing happens in this book.
Maybe something will jump out at me.
"Washing Old Witches"?
Nope.
And, may I add, gross.
- Hi.
- Hi.
"Easy Way Out".
- Well, this shouldn't be too hard.
- Yeah, that's what I'm hoping.
Plus, it's being run by my uncle.
Hello, young lady, Dashiell.
I always get a little misty whenever I see there are young people today who still believe in the old-fashioned values of community service.
- Bobby Calzone.
- Sabrina Spellman.
Hi.
I see you've met my nephew, Dashiell.
A good, fine, young witch for a half-mortal.
- Hey, I'm half-mortal too.
- Cool.
Are you right-handed?
Yeah.
Wow, it's like looking in a mirror.
You know, here at Easy Way Out, we're always on the lookout for a few special witches like yourself.
This is real community service, right?
I promised my quizmaster I-- Sabrina, you'll be working at the Rumour Mill.
How's that for real?
- Is that good?
- Are you kidding?
In this realm, rumours are considered the highest form of entertainment.
Think Riverdance with a conscience.
But I always thought rumours were bad.
Oh, mortal.
Trust me, kiddo, the Rumour Mill is the USO of witchly community service.
A morale builder.
As a matter of fact, rumours have actually been proven to make witches healthier.
Wow, I feel more noble already.
Come on, witches need our help.
Let's start our first smear campaign.
Okay.
I'm ready to hit the open road.
- "I'm with stupid"?
- Don't personalize it, Zelda.
I'm just trying to blend in with Middle America.
Fine.
Just put your stuff in the pickup I rented.
What?
Are they out of dump trucks?
It'll be fun.
For an all-American journey, an all-American vehicle.
All right, let's go.
I call shotgun.
Salem, you're not going.
- You have to stay here with Sabrina.
- What?
You didn't think we'd leave a teenager completely unsupervised, did you?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Are you telling me that this family is going to see the world's largest ball of twine, and the cat isn't coming?
- Sorry.
- With all due respect, ladies, would I leave you behind if I were going to see the world's largest eligible bachelor?
Yes.
If our entire goal was to unravel him.
Hey, don't forget to water the plants and bring in the mail.
You know, In Cold Blood took place in Kansas.
Welcome to the Rumour Mill.
We spread more rumours by 9 a.m. than most hairdressers do all day.
Is it always this busy?
I'm going to guess you guys don't get government funds.
Hey, hey, hey.
This room brings more joy to downtrodden witches than a thousand soup kitchens.
Really?
It seems kind of rundown.
Well, if I'm lying, I'm dying.
Now, listen up.
Here's how it works.
First, you think up a juicy rumour.
For instanceoh, I don't know.
Say, Sabrina's quizmaster wears a skirt.
Then you chuck your rumour in this black hole over here, word gets out, and, hey, presto.
The masses are entertained.
In some cases, even healed.
And my quizmaster won't mind wearing a skirt?
Rumours aren't true.
They're just entertainment.
Like pro wrestling.
Whoops!
I got a Stromboli stand on the south side of the realm, and it don't run without me.
- So are we set here?
- Sure.
Beautiful.
Go get them.
Where do we begin?
I don't know many witches.
- I live in the mortal realm.
- Really?
Me too.
Revere, Massachusetts.
Westbridge.
Hey, you guys had that huge linebacker who pulverized our quarterback.
And then the game started, and things really got bad.
Hey, maybe we should start rumours about people we know.
Why would Other Realmers care about them?
Well, my uncle said all rumours are entertaining.
We might as well entertain ourselves in the process.
"Mike Stratton, Revere linebacker, is also the captain of the synchronized swim team".
I like charity.
Okay.
Here goes.
Libby Chessler is so mean, her parents made her move out.
Let me guess.
Cheerleader.
- This is fun.
- Yeah.
And the best part about it is we're helping witches.
Without having to clip their toenails.
No doubt about it, we pulled the best community service.
Yeah.
But I think washing old witches would be fun too.
If I got to do it with you.
The hills are alive with the sound of gossip.
And we used up all the paper, Uncle C. Oh, nice work.
We haven't had so many rumours started since Walter Winchell worked here.
Now you two better skedaddle on home.
So soon?
Well, I guess it's back to the mortal realm.
You wanna get there through my laundry chute?
Sure.
Hey, you know, I was thinking maybe I'd volunteer here again, like, tomorrow at 3.
How about 3:15?
You didn't let me finish.
Like 3:15.
I just hope our rumours made an impact.
Trust me.
Just because my parents have threatened to evict me, doesn't mean they've stopped caring.
That's weird.
That sounds like that rumour I started about Libby.
Pumpkin, we mustn't.
It's wrong.
Not wrong.
Inappropriate, perhaps.
But I say the heck with it.
I love your fire.
Okay.
And that sounds very similar to that other rumour I-- Sabrina, do you have any veal and jelly in your locker?
I have this tremendous craving.
Harvey, please tell me you're having a bad love-handle day.
It's weird.
None of my clothes fit, my breasts are tender.
I'm gonna be sick.
Okay.
And that's the rumour I started about Harvey being pregnant.
That settles it.
This is a major coincidence.
Aunt Hilda!
Aunt Zelda!
Is anybody home?
Salem, what's going on?
Oh, shoot.
Ah, Sabrina.
I want you to meet the heads of the four families of Westbridge.
- Don Calamari.
- How you doing?
Don Ameche.
Don Tutti Fruitti.
And, of course, Don Da Don Don.
Hi.
Nice to meet you.
Salem, you're not in the Mafia.
It was just a rumour.
Gentlemen, you will have to forgive my little friend.
Sometimes she talks when she should be reading her magic book.
Then she would know that rumours started in the Other Realm become truths in the mortal realm.
Oh, well, in that case, Don Salem, on this day, the day of your daughter's wedding, how do I make it stop?
You don't.
Some of us like being Mafia bosses.
Me, I like it.
I get to wear a cool suit.
- You want I should whack her?
- No.
Nothing happens to Sabrina while her mother's still alive.
Gee, thanks.
I'll just go ask my aunts for help.
You didn't start a rumour about them?
No, I-- Oh, no.
When you said you wanted to navigate, I assumed it was because - you could read a map.
- And I can.
We are right in front of that terrifying thing!
But where have they been abducted to?
I got a warehouse near the waterfront for that kind of stuff.
Scusi, Don Tutti Fruitti, not that kind of abduction.
But grazie.
Zelda, can you use your finger?
- No.
Can you?
- No.
Well, I hope you're happy.
Oh, sure, it may not be a huge ball of twine, but aliens are pretty nifty.
Well, if you could navigate, we wouldn't be here.
This is my fourth abduction this month.
My wife's gonna kill me if I'm late with the ice cream again.
Perhaps this gentleman can teach you how to tell when the map is upside down.
Say it, don't spray it.
That means he's ready to remove all your organs.
But watch it, I tell you.
He's got cold hands.
Or, actually, tentacles.
Isn't that great?
Back off, shorty.
You don't understand.
You're next.
And if he don't operate on you, then-- - I'll tell you whose fault this is.
- It is not.
No, Hilda.
There's a third witch we haven't factored in.
Uh, ladies first.
Sabrina.
Thanks a lot.
I rarely use my liver.
Harvey, how'd you get so pregnant so fast?
How should I know?
Get off my back.
Sorry, Sabrina.
I'm just kind of emotional these days.
It's okay.
I'll figure something out.
Somebody better figure something out because these are not birthing hips.
Libby, what's wrong?
My parents have kicked me out.
Oh, I had no idea.
And I had absolutely nothing to do with it.
My mom says they don't love me anymore.
My dad says they never did.
What am I gonna do?
I'm so sorry.
I'm never gonna do that to my baby.
I've gotta find Calzone.
That sounds really good.
With chocolate sauce on it.
Oh, Willard, Willard, Willard.
- No.
Call me Vice Principal Kraft.
- Oh!
Oh, get a room.
Calzone, you better show your face.
He's not here.
Well, we've gotta find him.
All my rumours came true.
I know.
So did mine.
You don't understand.
There's a very nice boy who's staring down the barrel of a C-section.
You think I like this?
My sister's a unicorn.
Well, it's all your sleazy uncle's fault.
Hold on now.
We need some advice.
Can your quizmaster be trusted?
We'd better hope so.
He's our only shot.
Quizmaster, quizmaster Helping others is great Now get your butt in here Before it's too late There's a rumour going around that you have something to do with this hemline.
I cannot abide a cat who would let his owners give him a name that robs him of respect.
What would you have us do, Don Salem?
Whack Fluffy.
I'll send two of my best guys.
No, wait.
I want that cat to wake up with a mouse head in his bed.
Of course, godfather.
On second thought, bring me the mouse head.
To top it off, I'm beginning to feel sorry for Libby.
That's how bad things have gotten.
I told you not to take the easy way out.
No, you said not to phone it in.
Besides, the guy said that rumours help in the Other Realm.
Oh, and you believed him?
You know rumours are bad things.
There are a lot of things I used to know that turned out not true.
For example, I used to be pretty sure that people couldn't fly.
Oh, shoot.
That reminds me.
I gave my cousin Lillian bat wings.
Hilda, I noticed something while they were examining him.
Yeah.
He should get that mole checked.
No.
They undid his restraints in order to conduct the experiment.
I bet we can trick them into freeing our arms.
And then we can zap ourselves home.
No, we can't override this magic.
And then we can hit them.
Yes.
And provided you don't navigate, we can steer this baby home.
Please, before they touch me again.
Oh, you love it.
- Who is your quizmaster?
- My Uncle Calzone.
Calzone?
I know him.
Do me a favour and go see if he's at his Stromboli stand.
Oh, sure.
Are you gonna be okay, Sabrina?
She's going to be fine.
- That kid is trouble.
- What do you mean?
His uncle has had a score to settle ever since I got him kicked out of the quizmasters for cheating.
Why did he come after me?
With all due respect, you were the snitch.
Nothing's more embarrassing for a quizmaster than to have a pupil fail to get their licence.
Although getting caught in that skirt came close.
- I'm not gonna get my licence?
- After the havoc you wreaked?
Well, isn't there anything I can do?
Well, all the damage you've done will slowly go away after you start a vicious rumour about yourself.
And make it a good one.
I can't even get my grandma to return my phone calls.
- Sabrina.
- Hi, Libby.
I just heard a rumour about you.
I wonder if it's true.
I knew it.
You've got no teeth.
Sabrina's got no teeth.
I just heard that Sabrina has no teeth.
Ew.
Whoa.
Hey, Harvey, feeling better?
Yeah.
I must have been eating way too much salt.
Sabrina?
- Yes?
- I just wanted you to know, if you ever need your food pre-chewed, I would do that for you.
How sweet.
You always make me smile.
No, don't.
Sabrina, there's a phone call for you.
And could you make it quick?
I need to call the Smart Women, Foolish Choices hot line.
I'd love to move back in, Mom.
Yeah, but before we go into that, you'll never believe what's happened at school today.
Hello.
Yes, it's me.
Of course I'm willing to testify against Calzone.
I said, I'll testify.
I said-- I'll be right there.
Marone, that's good sauce.
I add a little garlic, oregano, and then I put some sugar in there.
That's my secret.
That's my trick.
- It's the feds!
- They're coming to get us.
I plead the Fifth.
Nice landing, Zelda.
It's okay, I didn't wanna have children anyway.
Hey, I haven't driven a clutch in a while.
I better go.
Uh Now, I may be a farmer, but these fellas in your sitting room sure do look like mob bosses.
Hey, guys.
That Sabrina got no teeth.
Let's get out of here.
Hey, come back.
We were all gonna go to Vegas and get comped at Boylesque.
Salem, I'm sure there's an explanation for turning our house into a social club.
But first, where is Sabrina?
I will tell you only if you promise never to ask me about my business again.
It just isn't the same with the guys gone.
Where is Sabrina?
The Witches' Council called her in.
We better get there.
Guess I wasn't meant to be a mob boss.
I think I'm garlic-intolerant.
Yes, we understand that you think your quizmaster rocks.
But unless you can produce this Calzone, we must hold your quizmaster responsible for all the trouble you've caused.
Are you aware that you have no teeth?
I did it to right a wrong.
Can anything be done about it?
Only because we're all about to lose our lunch.
Well, like I said, I don't know Calzone's present location, but I hope it will please the court to call other witnesses who may have information about the weasel's whereabouts.
Now, just a moment.
Is this Calzone a weasel?
Because we've been looking for a man.
Oh.
The court calls Dashiell Calzone.
- Are you the fugitive's nephew?
- Yes, I am.
- And do you know his whereabouts?
- I - I do not know, Your Honour.
- He's lying.
And I'm about to get demoted to crossing guard.
We're not going to demote you.
We're gonna arrest you.
You can't let your pupils run amok like this.
Bailiff, take the quizmaster into custody.
No, you can't do this.
I've got tenure!
- Don't worry, I'll get you out.
- Sabrina, wait.
Stay away from me.
My quizmaster was right about you.
I hate to do this.
Oh, good.
This place has such great karma for me.
Sabrina, I need you to know I had nothing to do with the trouble that you're in.
But I do know where my uncle is.
Well, why didn't you say anything?
Because the council can only send him to jail.
See, where I come from, that's a bad thing.
Calzone's a wheeler and dealer.
Jail would be fun to him.
- I want him to suffer.
- Well, how do you plan on doing that?
Well, I happen to know my conniving uncle is hanging out in the mortal realm.
"Calzone comes clean in quizmaster frame-up and vows to spend the rest of his life cleaning up dog parks".
"Barehanded".
You're good.
- Friends?
- You kidding?
You saved me and my quizmaster.
So how far is it from Westbridge to Revere?
Oh, about five minutes by spaceship.
Oh, hi, guys.
Uh, this is Dashiell.
Sabrina had nothing to do with this.
It's all my fault?
He's cute.
But unfortunately, I heard a rumour that you're grounded.
Oh, you have to stop reading those tabloids.
- Okay, I'm grounded.
- It's not so bad.
My parents are making me clean up Lillian's guano.
- You'll need a loofa.
Check.
- And grab that bunion stone.
What?
Just take it.
And plenty of Band-Aids.
- Oh, and a squeegee.
- Squeegee?
Sabrina, when you clean old witches-- Hundreds of old witches.
--anything that saves time is a welcome tool.
I know you guys are just trying to gross me out, but it's not working.
We tried.
Oh, one last thing.
- The tongue scraper.
- It scrapes tongues.
No problem.
Didn't work.
- Is she gone yet?
- Yeah.
Tongue scraper.
Yuck!
{END OF EPISODE 25}{START OF EPISODE 26}
Okay, fine.
See you.
No!
What's the matter, Salem?
Ringworm got you down?
My mother's coming for a visit.
I called to wish her a happy Mother's Day, and Oh, why didn't I just send the dry-roasted almonds like I usually do?
You should be happy your mother's coming.
I haven't seen my mother in over a year.
I'm a witch and she's a mortal and if she looks at me, she'll turn into a ball of wax, which is the stupidest rule I've ever heard of-- Hey!
We were talking about me.
Well, your mom knows you're now a cat, right?
How could you keep that a secret?
It slipped my mind?
You don't understand.
My mother's very critical.
I once wore sandals to the dinner table and she sent me to military school.
Were they flip-flops?
Because then I'm with her.
Sabrina, please, don't make me face my mother as a cat.
She'll hate me.
Use your magic.
Send me somewhere.
Anywhere.
I'm begging you.
Okay.
Oh, yes.
She'll never see me here.
Watch the show, then call me in the morning.
Stat!
- Ah!
There's Salem.
- Oh, maybe he won't see us.
Please?
Ugh.
Salem, we are not sending you to Palm Beach.
Okay, Tucson, Chattanooga, Moose Jaw, anywhere.
She's your mother.
She'll find you.
I still think we should visit our mother.
I just don't feel like taking a long trip right now.
Hilda, it'll take a 50th of a second.
Aunt Zelda, Aunt Hilda.
I didn't expect to find you standing right here.
That's the problem when a linen closet is your portal to the Other Realm.
Every now and then, you need towels.
Hi, Dashiell.
How was the date?
What'd you do?
Where'd you go?
Anyone get kissed?
We'll leave you two alone.
We're her legal guardians.
We're morally obligated to snoop.
I hope you had fun tonight.
I know you never time-travelled before.
I loved it.
Sliding from Canada to Mexico on the glacier was amazing.
Except for that whole raw-butt thing.
Ha, ha.
You're the most amazing, wonderful girl I've ever been out with.
You must be a mind reader because that's exactly what I wanted to hear.
It's as if you're trying to tell me something.
You know, I've always heard that if you enjoyed a kiss, then the other person probably enjoyed it too.
Really?
I never heard that.
- No.
Yes, I did.
- Bye.
Oh.
Ow.
I don't think this is practical.
Oh, Dash.
Hey.
Ow.
- Where'd you get the rose?
- I found it.
- So, what's new in your life?
- Actually, I need a favour.
Could you help me buy a Mother's Day present?
For your mom?
Last year, I got her a can opener.
I really have to stop taking gift advice from my dad.
- Everything okay?
- I miss my mom.
She's still on an archaeology expedition in Peru.
- You should visit her.
- I would, but then-- Waiting for the ancient city of Machu Picchu to get an Arby's.
So does your mom like wine cheese?
She finds it binding.
Really?
Well, there's always jewellery or bran.
Ha, ha.
- We'll find something.
- You're the best.
Oh, Harvey.
I have a very big problem.
Hilda?
Coming.
Why are you so resistant to the idea of seeing our own mother?
Because she likes you better than she likes me.
What?
That's ridiculous.
She loves us both exactly the same.
Perhaps she should like me better, but I don't think she does.
How come on your 8th birthday you got an entire observatory and I got corrective shoes?
Because I like stars and you have those funny toes.
Is Salem in the hamper again?
No.
Hello, Braveheart.
Don't make me face her.
See?
No one wants to be with their mother.
That's why there's a billion-dollar greeting-card industry.
We're leaving.
Salem, tell Sabrina to zap in something healthy for dinner.
Not just Fluffernutter.
And don't try to escape through your cat door, because I nailed it shut.
Mean.
Mother never loved me when I was human.
One little hug and I wouldn't have tried to take over Poland.
What are you doing here?
I left my clone back in my high school.
I just hope I can read his history notes this time.
Hey, you want to become invisible and go give the queen a wedgie?
Sounds like fun.
I can't.
I promised Harv-- A friend that I'd go shopping.
Just take a rain cheque.
I'd love to, but I can't break a promise.
Man, I like you.
Would you mind if I just stared at you all day?
- I'll send you a picture.
- Ready to go shopping?
Sure.
As soon as I get my chemistry book.
- For you.
- Thanks.
Did it rain?
Salem, Mother's here.
Momsie?
- Where are you?
Down here.
Salem?
What on earth happened?
I tried to take over the world.
The Witches' Council sentenced me to 100 years as a cat.
I eat off the floor and sleep by the dryer.
Go ahead, let me have it.
Salem Saberhagen, you always disappoint me.
Uh-huh.
- You're selfish and irresponsible.
You're a terrible person.
But if you aren't the cutest little kitty I have ever seen in my entire life.
- I am?
- Come to Mama.
Chanel?
Well, that was fun.
Sorry I couldn't make up my mind about a gift.
There's nothing wrong with any of the sweaters you showed me - or the perfume.
- Or the earrings or the picture frames or the foot massagers.
I just really want this present for my mom to be perfect.
Especially since you wrecked her car last week.
And I kind of love her.
Sabrina.
- Who was that?
The oven.
Uh, I forgot, I'm baking bread.
An oven timer that calls you by name?
Hey, maybe my mom would like one.
Sabrina?
!
Sorry, you have to go.
I forgot, I have to set off a bug bomb.
Um, but maybe we can do the shopping thing again tomorrow.
Well, can I ask you one more thing?
Whatever it is, the answer's yes.
- Really?
So we can go steady again?
- Huh?
Sabrina?
!
Who's he?
Uh, Harvey, this is Dashiell.
Dashiell, this is Harvey.
You won't believe this, but you guys have so much in common.
See, Harvey's a really close friend, or was until about five minutes ago when he asked me to go steady.
And, um, Dashiell's this very new person in my life who I very recently have been seeing.
Naturally, I was gonna tell both of you about Well, both of you.
Well, we said we weren't gonna be exclusive.
And we never talked about only seeing each other.
Great.
This is good.
This is very good.
Choose.
That's odd.
I told Mother we were coming.
That's the problem.
You told her we're coming.
If it were just you, she'd be here.
But since it's me, she's probably hiding under a pile of coats.
You're being childish.
I'll just see if she left a key.
More proof.
She told me it was under the flower pot.
- How about now?
- No!
- How about now?
No!
Look, I'll let you guys know when I decide.
Just please go.
No!
What a good kitty my son is.
Yes.
- Hi, Mrs. Saberhagen.
- Hi.
You're just a big ball of fluff.
That's what you are.
Isn't he a big ball of fluff?
That's what he is, all right.
I'm going to make my son a nice big fish dinner.
With fish?
Both of you go home!
Mom's making mackerel.
Salem, can we talk?
Isn't my mother great?
I mean, all mothers are great, but isn't my mother just plain better than anyone else's?
Harvey and Dash want me to choose between them.
I don't know what to do.
Did I tell you she brushed me for hours this afternoon?
It felt so silky good.
- Salem, you're not even listening to me.
- I am too.
MRS.
Salem, you wanna lick the deboning knife?
Gotta go.
Good luck with the bake sale.
Maybe I can't see my mother without turning her into a giant candle, but I don't see why I can't write her a letter.
When it absolutely, positively has to be there in two seconds flat.
Are you crazy?
You wear those clothes and ask if I'm crazy?
Your mother is mortal.
You are half-witch.
You are not allowed to send her letters until you get your witch's licence.
And that includes airmail.
You opened my paper airplane?
I think that's illegal.
Oh, I didn't read it.
The Witches' Council did and they are furious.
They've handed down a decree.
Hey, I think you singed my eyebrows.
Oh, boy, this is worse than I ever imagined.
- What does it say?
- Well, because you broke the rules, you have to choose between being a witch or seeing your mom ever again.
I have to either give up all my magic or never see my mother again?
That's crazy.
It's unjust.
It's unfair.
I'm pretty sure it's bad for the environment.
It's the council.
They're one gaggle of bitter old witches.
No one ever said I couldn't write to my mother.
Well, it's right here in your magic book.
Not anymore.
You have to choose between your mom or your magic.
You have 12 hours.
Wasn't choosing between boyfriends enough for one day?
Unh.
"Winner of the Other Realm Science Fair: Zelda Spellman".
Oh.
"Outstanding Student of the Decade: Zelda Spellman".
Aw.
"The Best of the Best: Zelda Spellman".
Oh, you're right.
She loves us both the same.
Oh, come on.
There must be something here of yours.
Oh.
Oh, look.
She kept your hat.
She borrowed it over a hundred years ago and never returned it.
Really?
She always returns everything she borrows from me.
Aunt Zelda?
Aunt Hilda?
Can you hear me?
I need help.
The Other Realm customer you are trying to contact is not available or has travelled outside our service area.
Please try again later.
Hey, I'm supposed to have unlimited roaming with this thing.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Listen, the other day when I said choose, I meant choose me.
I wish that was the only decision I had to make.
- What?
- Nothing.
You get your mom's present yet?
No, I still haven't found anything perfect enough.
To get Harvey's mind off This romantic rift Send his mom the ideal gift You're kidding.
Uh, how about this?
Is that Heidi and her goat friends?
- It could be.
- Oh, my mom's been wanting it for years, but they stopped making it.
Three cheers for them.
My mom'll pass a stone.
- How on earth did you ever get this?
- Magic.
Carrots?
A little standard, but thanks.
They're not for you.
I bought you a pony named Petey.
- So you like me better?
- Dash, I-- Oh, come on.
Look, there's an unimaginative mortal boy and me.
What's your decision?
I'm thinking nunnery.
Ticktock.
Clock's ticking, Sabrina.
- Your mom or your magic?
- Right now, magic.
Oh, I can still do it from here.
Ticktock.
Ticktock.
How would you like your salmon today, dear?
In huge portions?
- Anybody want carrots?
Ticktock.
Ticktock.
Very subtle.
- I'll put some carrots in with the fish.
- No!
Don't taint it.
Whatever my pudding cake wants.
Ha, ha.
I can't believe I lived all those years without contact with my mom.
I tell you, Sabrina, my heart is floating.
I got to go think.
Are you catching a cold, Mommy?
Here.
Oh.
Thank you, Salem.
Oh, my little boy.
Yes, you are.
What am I gonna do?
I know, I know, ticktock.
Salem.
Sabrina, Sabrina.
Oh, I miss my mom, but I love having magic.
I know what I have to do.
Ah, ah, ah  Maybe you put too much pepper in the peppers.
- Achoo!
- Bless you.
Oh, I haven't sneezed this much since 200 years ago when your father brought home that stray  Cat!
No!
Quizmaster!
- I've made my decision.
- Ah, good, because  Sorry, I was just trying to lighten things up.
- I love being a witch.
- So that's your decision?
But I can't live without seeing my mother.
Man, you're sure you realise what this means?
Your powers will be gone forever.
You won't even be able to do card tricks.
This is the hardest decision I've ever had to make.
- I've made up my mind.
- All right, then.
Hey, you okay?
I've seen more colour in plain yoghurt.
I feel nervous and insecure and self-conscious and extremely depressed.
Then the transformation is complete.
You're a normal teenager again.
Do me a favour and zap me to my mommy.
Sure thing.
You could have been a little more gentle.
- Sabrina?
Aah!
- Mom!
- How come I'm not a ball of wax?
- Because I'm not a witch anymore.
- What happened?
- Well, it's a long story.
Is there a dunghill where we can go sit and talk?
There must be something of yours that Mother kept.
Give it up, Zelda.
There's nothing.
Oh, wait a minute.
I found something.
- What?
- This stain on the carpet.
- I spilled ink when I was young.
- That's right.
Mother had just made friends with Rorschach.
That's how she remembers me.
A smudge on the carpet of her life.
Wait.
What's this?
"The first thing little Hilda ever zapped".
My little clay horse.
Why is it in pain?
Because I gave it corrective shoes.
The point is, she kept this stupid little thing all these years because it meant so much to her.
She didn't keep anything like this of yours.
Maybe she does like me best.
Hello?
Mother, where are you?
Hilda and I have been waiting-- I see.
Uh-huh.
Well, then.
All right.
Goodbye, Mother.
What?
What?
What?
She's with Vesta.
They went shopping.
Vesta bought her some new ears and now Vesta's taking her to the Riviera to show them off.
I know she's our sister and I love Vesta, but where does she get off living so long?
Well, it does solve the mystery.
Our mother's favourite daughter.
Vesta.
- More beetle purÃ©e?
- No!
But thank you.
It was wonderful, except for the taste.
Oh, the life of an archaeologist.
Ever regret not staying an archaeology teacher and living the comfortable indoor life?
No.
I mean, no life is ever perfect, Sabrina, you know.
Every choice you make you have your good parts and your bad parts.
- Beetle husk.
- Bad part.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
Like, giving up magic was bad, but then I got you.
Of course, I'm risking malaria, but it was a lovely sunset.
But I still have to choose between Harvey and Dash.
You know what I'd do?
I would make a list of pros and cons for each guy, right?
Then I would throw it away and follow my heart.
- I missed you.
- I missed you too, honey.
So any other questions you have that only a mother can answer?
Yeah.
How do I get off this mountain?
Bye, honey.
Have a safe trip.
See you soon?
Bye.
See you soon.
You know, you might want to call my aunts to tell them I might be a little late.
Heh.
Now why are you crying?
My mom went to a doctor for allergy treatments.
She's gonna take the needle just for me.
I'm sorry you only got to see your mother for such a short time.
She's my mother.
A short time's plenty.
Look what I found.
It's Sabrina.
I rode a burro to a truck, a truck to a bus, a bus to the airplane.
The burro was the best part.
How was your trip to Peru?
I meant to ask you to pick me up an alpaca sweater.
What are you doing here?
I don't need a quizmaster.
Soap is what she needs.
And a wire brush.
I know you're going to get mad when you hear this, - but this whole thing was a test.
- What?
!
Maybe I should have broke the news away from all these sharp objects.
What kind of test?
!
What are you talking about?
Why is he always doing this to me?
Ugh.
My clothes are too encrusted with dirt.
Can someone please kick him?
One of the most important tests you take before getting your licence-- Maybe the most important.
--is to show that there is something in this universe that means more to you than magic.
And you proved that by choosing your mother.
And we couldn't be prouder of you.
Let me guess.
You two were involved in this?
We had to leave you alone so you could take the test by yourself.
Although why we couldn't have gone to Acapulco still baffles me.
Wait, this couldn't have been a test.
I mean, my powers are really out.
Why else would I have to drive Your powers were taken away so you could visit your mom.
Now that you're back, so is your magic.
- So I can really zap again?
- Absolutely.
Then what am I waiting for?
This is a thankless job.
What about Harvey and Dashiell?
Yeah, who are you gonna choose?
We're dying to know.
Well, my mom said to follow my heart, so that's what I'm gonna do.
That's how I ended up sharing a studio apartment with Vlad the Impaler.
Come on, who are you gonna choose?
I don't know, but I guess I have time to decide.
Ticktock.
- Quit it!
Is there an ETA on that bath?
Dash is really sweet and funny, but Harvey's really sweet and funny.
But Dash is half-witch, so we have so much in common.
But Harvey and I have so much history together.
I mean, a whole year.
Dash has that great smile, but Harvey has those great puppy-dog eyes.
Oh, I don't know how I'm gonna decide.
What do you think?
I think you smell.
Could we at least run a bath while you talk?
I don't think it's me.
Good grief, man!
Be civilised.
Some of us use a box.
