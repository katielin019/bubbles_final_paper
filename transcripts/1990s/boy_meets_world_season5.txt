{START OF EPISODE 1}
No, no, no, don't touch that door.
Cory, we've waited three years to go through this door.
They say the senior floor is like no other, my Shawn.
Okay?
So let us, as one, take a moment and savor.
Oh, baby!
Oh, baby!
This is gonna be the best year of our lives, Shawnie.
Welcome to the senior floor and the best year of your life.
You're seniors?
We're teachers.
We're teachers.
I have so much to learn.
So I guess, as seniors, we can expect a pretty difficult year?
Swedish massage, shiatsu, or should I Rolf you right here?
Frozen frappuccinos, iced blended mochas, and the answers to all the tests.
Enjoy.
Shawn, beverage?
Sorry.
I was just making out with my history teacher.
Hi.
I'd love to stay and chat, but I can't.
I have an exam in Roman History.
Boys.
You know, Shawn, I wonder how the cafeteria food is this year.
Prime rib.
Center-cut or end-cut?
Both.
And be quick about it, meat boy.
Wait till you see what happens to you in my fantasy.
Seniors, you've put in a lot of hard work today.
Now it's time to graduate.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Huh.
This is pretty much how I imagined it.
Yeah, yeah, me, too.
Bye.
Okay.
Shawn, I've been waiting for this my whole life.
Eric has gone to college, and the room is mine.
All mine!
What's with all the candles?
Oh!
Those are for Topanga.
Those set the mood.
It kind of looks like a church in here.
You're ruining the mood.
Finally, you know, I'm no longer a guest in this room.
It's mine.
You see that picture?
Mine.
You see that wallpaper?
Mine.
Whose queen-size bed is this?
Mine!
First room to yourself, huh?
Maybe.
It comes with the industry standard 20-year warranty.
And remember, "No means no.
" You know, Shawn, I can feel it.
We're seniors this year.
We're unstoppable, baby.
This is gonna be the best year of our lives!
Daddy's home!
Eric, what are you doing here?
Oh, you didn't get rid of my bed, did you?
First day of college, and I got no place to stay.
I show up at the dorm, I say, "Excuse me.
Front, please.
"Eric Matthews.
I go here.
"Where's my towel?
Where's my room"?
They tell me I'm not on the list.
Like there's a list!
Eric, I gave you the forms for the housing list three months ago.
Amy, go easy on him.
Our son had a little mix-up in housing.
He's home for a visit.
Cake?
Ooh!
Cut it for me?
This is not a visit.
He's back.
Why isn't Mommy happy to see me?
I am.
It's just, sometimes, you scare me.
I mean, how are you supposed to do well in college if you can't even fill out a housing application?
Oh!
It's worse than that.
I checked the wrong box on another form, now they think I'm an Eskimo.
I give up.
Oh, go on.
Relax your mother.
Tell her your plans.
Well, I thought I'd hang out here till this little housing snafu works itself out.
College is hard.
So, hoops tomorrow, Daddy?
You're on, buddy.
I'll see you on the court, man.
All right.
Bye, Mom.
I'll be looking for you!
All right!
How come you're not kissing me?
Because the second our lips touch, he's coming in here.
Watch.
Look, Cory, this is your room now, and Eric knows it.
He's not just going to walk in here and take over.
Kiss.
Okay.
Hello.
Aren't you supposed to knock before you enter my room?
Your room?
Your room!
Your room!
Hey, Topanga, be a dear and scooch over, will you?
Great.
Ah!
Big Daddy rocks!
Eric!
Big Daddy rocks!
Big Daddy rocks!
Topanga!
I should go now.
Bye.
Bye, Topanga.
Bye, Eric.
Yeah!
She didn't leave 'cause of me, did she?
No.
She left because big Daddy rocks!
Eric, why are you doing this to me?
Why are you home?
I don't know.
You know, I'm not gonna let you do this to me this time, Eric.
No way.
Tomorrow, I am dedicating my entire day to finding you a place.
A place that is not here.
Good night, sweet Cory.
You know that's coming down, right?
Good night, Cor.
And I mean, I must have shown Eric, like, 10 places.
He doesn't like anything.
Okay, one place has a white fridge.
He wants avocado.
Then he insists on something with an ocean view, so he can relax his nerves.
An ocean view sounds nice.
We live in Philadelphia!
Stop snapping.
I'm the girlfriend.
Say, "Kiss.
" Kiss.
Sorry.
It's just, I don't understand Eric.
He's got this great opportunity to be out of the house, instead he returns home to give me the business.
You know what you need?
You need some college guy to walk down those stairs, announce that he's new in town and that he needs roommates.
If you love me, you could make that happen.
Excuse me.
New guy in town.
Going to Pennbrook.
Just got a three-bedroom apartment and looking for roommates.
I heard him talking outside, but I do love you, though.
Kiss.
No time.
Yo, new guy.
This place, does it have a view?
Oh, yeah.
By the river.
Yay!
Listen, you ask about the fridge, because if he sees how happy I am, he might think I'm insane.
Fridge?
Big green one.
I think they call it avocado.
Yay!
Yay!
Have I got a roommate for you, baby.
It's not you, is it?
No, no, it's not me.
Take a look at this.
You have a picture of your brother in your wallet?
Yeah.
Why?
Oh, nothing.
I just think it's sweet.
I'm in there, too, right?
You will be.
Nice-looking guy.
Easy on the eyes.
Could be some competition for the ladies.
Nah.
Okay, I'll meet your brother.
Yes!
Finally, something good happens for Cory.
The world is my friend.
What are you doing here?
No, don't ruin this for me.
Shawn, listen, whoever this guy is, whatever minor personal infraction happened between the two of you, let it go, because the world knows that this one is gonna be Eric's roommate, and the world is my friend.
How do you two know each other?
He's my brother.
Of course he is.
He is not your brother.
Same dad, different moms.
His mom bailed on my dad years ago, found a guy with a few bucks, and I guess they've kept Jack pretty busy, 'cause we haven't heard from him.
That's not exactly the way it happened.
Whatever, Jack.
Look, Shawn, look, I think we need to talk, okay?
You turned your back on your father, and on me!
There.
We talked.
Come on now.
You got the ball?
You want the ball?
You watch the ball?
Oh!
Whoa!
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
It's nice to see father and son together again, playing a spirited game of hoops, huh?
You're not happy, are you?
For years, now, I have watched you give advice to everybody, but never me!
Why is that?
Why?
You don't ask.
Eric was supposed to be in college, but at the first little bump in the road, he comes running back home, and Alan is okay with it.
But you're not?
It was hard enough saying goodbye to Eric.
I don't want to do it again.
Well, perhaps Alan just misses Oh, that's not it.
This is it.
He's Eric's father, he's Eric's best friend.
The best friend can't bring himself to say goodbye and kick Eric out of the nest.
Thank you, George.
Oh!
Well said.
I have problems, too, you know.
So how was your day, boy?
Just another day.
Anything out of the ordinary?
Just another day.
I like this talking we're doing.
It's good.
Yeah?
Come in.
What can I do for you?
Well.
Look at you.
How are you?
Well, I been okay.
This is a surprise.
I ran into Shawn today.
You told me nothing special happened today.
Yeah, I did.
Shawn, don't be like that.
We got ourselves a little family reunion cooking here, huh?
So, how's your mama's husband?
Your stepdaddy, how is he treating you?
He treats me well.
You still in school?
I graduated from high school.
I'm going to Pennbrook now.
Well, what do you know about that?
I got me a boy in college!
I guess your new daddy raised you up good.
Yeah.
Raised him up so good, he hasn't come to visit all this time.
What are you doing here, Jack?
You know, maybe he needs a place to stay.
Look, Jack, I mean, this ain't much, but I know you're used to better, but we could get another rollaway cot, and you could Oh, it's okay.
I got an apartment by the college.
Soon as I find some roommates, the place is mine.
I asked you what you're doing here, Jack.
Did you finally get up enough guilt about Dad to pay him a little pity call?
That's not it.
I wanted to come here.
I have a brother here.
I came here to see you, too.
Yeah, right.
You know, seeing you two brothers together like that, an idea comes over me.
I don't get a whole lot of ideas, but I'm pretty sure this is a good one.
You two boys have been given an opportunity to get to know each other.
I think you should take advantage of it.
No, Dad.
He wants a roommate, I want you to live with him.
I'd love to have you as my roommate, man.
I mean, it's a great apartment, terrific area.
No.
Look, if you're worried about the rent, I can make up the difference.
There it is!
Jack is here to try and rescue me from trailer life.
No, that's not why I'm here.
Look, forget it, man.
I gotta go.
I'm sorry.
It was good to see you.
I'll call you.
You know, I just thought it would be good, Shawn, for the both of us.
Jack!
Uh Uh Here, take this.
It's gonna be a cold one tonight.
Thanks.
What are you trying to do?
Shawn, ever since you were born, I I always wanted to give you something I never could, until now.
A chance at a better life.
Take it.
He means nothing to me.
He's your brother.
He's a good boy.
I think you ought to move in with him.
Maybe some of that Pennbrook stuff will rub off on you, and I'll have two boys in college.
Dad, why are you trying to kick me out?
I might not be much of a father, but I know this is right.
So get outta here.
Scoot!
Go on!
I'm not going anywhere.
you're not much of a father.
Oh, it'll be perfect.
Now, all I ask is that, when you meet Jack, you just be yourself, okay?
And whatever you do, do not flash that big, phony, plastic, cheesy grin of yours.
No, it really turns people off.
Hey, guys!
Jack!
How are you?
Love the place.
It's not an avocado fridge, but nice!
Hey, Eric.
Yeah.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you, too, Jack.
Do you smoke?
No.
Do you smoke?
No.
You like pets?
Nah.
I have a hard enough time keeping track of myself.
You?
I'm not a pet guy.
I got four kids, though.
I thought it was funny.
Favorite color on three.
Go.
One, two, three.
Blue!
One, two, three.
Blue!
See you later, Eric.
Yeah, nice to meet you.
All right.
I don't like him.
Eric, what are you doing to me?
We had a deal.
You and Jack are so perfect for each other, you should be married.
I'm not ready.
Why are you trying to ruin my whole year?
Well, guess what, I'm not gonna let you, because starting now, you do not exist.
You are invisible to me.
Please move.
Hey, hey, Daddy-o.
Play another game of "old man can't jump"?
Oh, trash talk all you want, I'll let my hook shot do the talking.
Alan, stay!
No, no.
That's a dog command.
You don't give me a dog command.
Sit.
Okay, but you owe me a treat.
If we let him stay here, he will never grow up.
Well, you think I don't know that?
What am I supposed to do?
What kind of father throws his own son out, Cory?
I mean, why can't I have a dad like him?
Eric's never gonna leave, and he's fine with it.
I'm done.
Come on, box it out.
Box it out!
Hey, you wanna play a little two-on-two, with me and Dad?
No, I wanna play two-on-you're not here.
I don't get it.
I know you don't.
Hey.
Hey.
Daddy-o, come on.
Two-on-two.
You and me against the short guys.
Let's go.
As much as I love it when it's you and me, how long is this gonna go on?
I don't know.
We could play to, what, 21.
Or 11.
Or 17.
That'd be weird, huh?
I'm not talking about the game.
Maybe I should go.
No, no, no, you stay.
You're family.
What's going on?
Eric, there's nothing I enjoy more than having you here.
Me, too.
You got one week to find yourself a new place.
You're kicking me out?
Well, I don't get this.
I thought we were friends.
We are friends, but I am also your father, and I know that this is right.
Eric In every kid's life, there comes a time when he's just got to move on.
And I hate that that time has come, but I wouldn't be a good father if I didn't recognize it, and I need you to recognize it, too.
Hey!
If I didn't think you could make it, I wouldn't be kicking you out.
Enjoy your room.
My room?
You heard me.
You are a good father.
I hope he understands.
He will.
Thanks.
I still can't believe you give Alan Matthews half the credit.
Except for all the flowery words, I said the same thing.
Well, he just helped me see what you said.
I know how hard this is for you, Dad.
You do?
You're a good father.
Well, I guess I guess I give the man his due then.
All right, here we go.
Hey!
Favorite movie.
On three.
One, two, three.
Godfather.
One, two, three.
Godfather.
Part II.
Part II.
I don't get him.
Standard rental agreement for a year.
Let's make it three.
All right, sign here, here, and here.
Hey, Jack.
Hey!
Welcome to your new home, bud.
Thanks.
It comes with hardwood floors, high ceilings And a brother.
I know it's not much, boys, but it works.
All right!
We really need this.
You know I'm not gonna say Goodbye?
Right.
Right.
I'm not saying it.
All right?
I mean, it's very hard for me to say Goodbye?
Just give me a hug.
See you, guys.
Bye.
See you.
Bye!
How you holding up, Chet?
I did my crying in the truck.
Aw, this father thing, it's just not an easy job, is it?
No.
But I'm learning.
Well, I did it.
I got my own place.
Yeah.
Me, too.
Listen, Cor.
I'm sorry.
You know, with getting into college and moving out, it just It just seemed easier to stay.
You know, I wasn't trying to kick you out of my life.
I was trying to kick you out of my room.
Oh, thanks.
Well, I guess you got to get going.
You wanna go set that room up the way you like, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah, lots of things to do.
All right.
Listen, Cor, actually, the, uh, landlord, he made a mistake.
He made two sets of keys, so Don't be a stranger.
Mr. Feeny's sick today.
We have a substitute.
Oh!
That's great.
No, no, no, that's bad.
Whenever Feeny's sick, he handpicks his substitutes.
They're always old, they're always mean and they always make us miss Feeny.
Hello, class.
I'm Miss Valentine.
Oh!
It's her.
She was in our fantasy.
What fantasy?
No fantasy.
Mr. Feeny has graded your tests from last Friday.
A "B"?
Not bad.
A "D"?
All right.
Let me take care of this.
After all, we do have some history.
She was in our fantasy.
Say, "Kiss.
" Kiss.
Apparently it wasn't her.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Previously on Boy Meets World Excuse me.
New guy in town.
Going to Pennbrook.
Just got a three-bedroom apartment and looking for roommates.
What are you doing here?
No, don't ruin this for me.
Shawn, listen, whoever this guy is, whatever minor personal infraction happened between the two of you, let it go, because the world knows that this one is gonna be Eric's roommate, and the world is my friend.
How do you two know each other?
He's my brother.
You two boys have been given an opportunity to get to know each other.
I think you should take advantage of it.
No, Dad.
He wants a roommate, I want you to live with him.
Welcome to your new home, bud.
Thanks.
It comes with hardwood floors, high ceilings And a brother.
Hi, Janice.
Huh!
Well, my October's pretty full.
But the third Friday in November looks good.
You'll have to share me with Phyllis, but why don't I pencil you in there?
Hey, Brother Shawn.
It's me, Jack, home from college.
Got an "A".
Now they want me to teach.
Cut.
Let me explain this once again.
I'm shooting a documentary for Feeny's film class.
It's like MTV's The Real World.
Now, I'm gonna follow you around the apartment, but for this to work, I need you to please be yourselves.
Well, my October really is full.
I really did get an "A".
What's up, dudes?
Caught some major waves downtown.
Now, that's not real!
Come on!
Let's do this again.
This is the true story of three new roommates.
Eric.
How great is this?
Jack.
Do you know how great this is?
And Shawn.
This is great!
I'm not sure this will work.
It's been a long time.
Yeah, long time.
The real reason I moved in here was because my dad thought it would be a good chance for me to get to know my half-brother, Jack.
So, you like cottage cheese?
Yeah.
I do.
Ladies seem to think Jack's a pretty good-looking guy.
Not much competition for me, though.
I'm eight months older, and I work out.
Enough said.
Don't show that.
Eric spends a lot of time in front of the mirror.
But that's not going to help with the pretty babies.
See, women like a guy who's more interested in them than himself.
No, let's do it again.
I can give you a better smile.
You know, I really hope this thing works out with my brother.
Although it's been years since I've seen him and I don't even know if we're anything alike.
No, let's do it again.
I can give you more vulnerability.
An excellent start on your documentary, Mr. Matthews.
What?
Yes, excellent.
I said, "Excellent.
" And I was talking about something you did.
I don't know what came over me.
Wow.
Mr. Feeny, you really think that I made a good film?
No.
I think The Graduate was a good film.
What we have here is an excellent What?
Don't toy with me, Mr. Matthews.
I would simply suggest that this being your senior year and NYU having a wonderful film program, that this student film could be your foot in the door to a fine university.
This film could be my foot.
That said, are there any comments on the documentary we just saw?
Angela.
No offense, Cory, but your project looks like you ripped off that show on MTV, The Real World.
I have no knowledge of this Real World of which you speak.
My real world is the real, real world.
You know, Topanga, I am so inspired here.
I mean, I haven't even begun to scratch the surface on this whole apartment thing.
I mean, you got Eric who hasn't been on his own at all, and then you got two brothers who haven't seen each other in years, all sharing a single bathroom.
My God, the possibilities.
Cory, are you sure that your friends are okay with you sticking a camera in their personal lives?
Not just okay, delighted, giddy.
Where'd I put my camera anyway?
How long do I have to smile like this, Cory?
Cor?
Yeah, Jack found a pretty nice place, but that's what he's used to.
He grew up with money.
Although the apartment doesn't have the charm of the place I used to live in.
I do like the idea of being able to take a shower without worrying about whether a twister is going to suck me naked through the roof.
You go too far.
I've got a film to make, Shawn.
Now, you agreed to do this.
Cory, you have five minutes of me in the shower!
You can't use that!
Well, it's for the European version.
Okay, if I don't get into NYU, my next choice is Sweden YU.
Hello.
Hi, I'm Wendy from 3-B.
I stopped by to say hi to Jack.
Oh, he's not here.
Drop the towel.
What?
Drop the towel.
Make it look like an accident, but drop it.
Why is a strange boy with a camera dressed like Paddington Bear?
He's doing a student film.
If it embarrasses you, you can just tell him to stop.
No, no, I'm an acting major.
Here we go.
I have two monologs.
Nora from A Doll's House and one that I wrote called, "I'm a Little Unicorn.
" I'm also very good at improv.
She's good at improv.
Kiss her.
Get away!
I can do love scenes.
I'm not afraid.
Okay.
Wow.
Wow.
Call me.
Wow!
Wow!
She comes to see Jack, Shawn gets her number.
The plot thickens.
So, Shawn, how are things working out with your brother?
Don't tell her.
Let her see it on film.
Shawn, are you sure you're okay with this?
I mean, it sounds kind of personal.
It is.
But, you know, Cory's my best friend, and I trust that he's not going to make me look bad.
My vision is to show people a side of Shawn Hunter that they have never seen before.
What side is that?
Well, the side that shows you overcoming all the odds.
You know, moving out of the trailer park, getting to know your newfound brother from a different social class who desperately wants to bond with you, and in a stunning plot twist, just walked in with your new girlfriend.
Let's see what happens.
I can't believe he snaked her.
Hey, Shawn.
This is Wendy.
Yeah.
We've met.
Hi.
What do you mean you've met?
Could I talk to you for a minute?
I'm going to talk to him for a minute.
So, how do you know Wendy?
She came to the door.
I was in a towel.
You?
Orientation.
It was a lot more exciting than it sounds.
Phone number.
Phone number.
Kiss?
Kiss.
And she performed "I'm a Little Unicorn" for me.
We've got a problem here, Jack.
No.
The only problem I see is that I'm in the middle of a date, and you're in the middle of me being on a date.
Where did you take her?
To dinner and a concert.
Dinner and a concert?
Sheryl Crow.
We're here for dessert.
You win.
What?
I can't compete with dinner and a concert, Jack.
Shawn, it's not a competition.
Well, not anymore.
Look, there's more to this than Wendy, okay?
So if you want, I'll tell her to go home, and you and I could have some time to talk.
Cory?
No, you know what?
I'm sorry I bothered you at all.
Have a nice date, okay?
Cory?
Shawn and I are not getting off to a good start.
I really don't know why it isn't working.
Maybe this whole thing was a mistake.
It's been too many years.
I mean, what was my dad thinking?
He puts us in an apartment together, and we're suddenly supposed to be brothers?
I mean, what makes us brothers?
Cory's more my brother.
Guy's first time away from home.
About to do laundry, unsupervised.
Hello.
Do you know where your story is?
No, no, no, not in the hot water.
It'll shrink!
Oh!
I should be there to talk him through this.
He's an idiot.
Cut the cord.
Guys, this is Eric.
His real name is Larry.
He's my best friend, Barbie's, brother.
But around us, he's Eric.
Hi, Mom, Daddy.
What's going on, please?
We all miss Eric so much, I hired Larry to be Eric.
That's ridiculous.
Does he play basketball?
Hi, Mom, Daddy.
Who are you?
Eric.
Who are you?
Eric.
Welcome.
Hey, I'm going to need some more clothes.
No kidding.
Cory, question.
You know Shawn better than anybody else.
What is wrong with him?
Why can't he get along with Jack?
I'll talk to him.
Well, you better get over there 'cause they're gonna kill each other.
And all through my life, everyone's always asked me, "What do you want to be when you grow up, young whippersnapper"?
Who talks like that?
Crazy people.
And the point is, it was a lot of pressure, Topanga.
And now that I've found something that I'm good at, it's like the pressure's off.
Cory, why can't you just put down your camera and realize that your friend is in trouble?
Pressure, pressure from the girlfriend.
I thought I was doing you a favor.
Well, I don't need your charity.
It's not charity.
I felt bad for you because you couldn't afford those concert tickets, so I bought them.
I don't want anything you bought with your father's money, okay?
For your information, I work every summer for my money.
I'm not some spoiled little rich kid, okay?
I pay for school with student loans.
And what do you have against my father, Shawn?
Nothing.
I don't even know him.
What do you have against your real father?
Shawn, my father is the one who raised me.
I can't just have feelings for someone I don't know.
Yeah?
Well, neither can I. You can find yourself another roommate.
What do you think?
You hide behind that camera and disappear?
That must not be a very good lens if you cannot see what's going on here.
Topanga, listen, I understand what you're saying, okay?
But what you don't understand is that the assignment is to make a documentary.
I'm like the guy making a nature film in Africa, and when that antelope is about to get eaten by the lion, the guy behind the camera doesn't stop the lion.
He films it and lets nature take its course.
And as a filmmaker, maybe you're right.
But as a friend, well, then I guess we'll just have to let nature take its Nature take its what?
That's how you end a sentence?
Where do you come up with these?
Morgan, I understand that you miss Eric.
Yeah.
But you can't replace him by hiring this young man.
I'm not trying to replace him.
I just want to miss my real brother less.
Your parents can't possibly approve of this.
Yeah, they do.
My dad even plays basketball with him.
Now I want you to give him some advice, like you always gave Eric.
Run, man.
Run like the wind.
Hey, Cor.
Those junipers are coming in quite nicely this year, huh, Mr. Feeny?
Don't mock my garden.
I know you too well, Mr. Matthews.
If you have a problem, just come out with it.
Did you mean it when you said I could be an excellent filmmaker?
I think your project shows great potential.
Yeah.
Yeah, it does.
I mean, it's got passion, it's got conflict, everything that makes a film great, right?
Mmm-hmm.
Looks like you're on track.
Yeah.
The problem is Topanga.
See, she doesn't understand that the guy behind the camera has to stay behind the camera and not get emotionally involved.
Even though this means that Shawn and his new brother may not be getting along.
I see.
Well, Mr. Matthews, I think it's safe to say that no matter how your film turns out, you have the potential of being a sensitive and caring filmmaker, if you so choose.
Why do you say that?
Because I know you to be a sensitive and caring young person.
And I'll be very interested in seeing how your story turns out.
Film.
Yes.
Film.
Hey, Jack.
Got some lovelies here from Dance, Jack.
I'm dancing.
You don't seem to be enjoying yourself.
No.
He is enjoying himself, let me tell you.
This wild man here is the kind of guy who likes to dance on the inside.
Dance on the outside, Jack.
You know, maybe we should call it a night.
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no.
No, the day Eric Matthews calls it a night at 7:00 is the day he leaves the business.
You look really depressed.
Should I do a comedic monolog?
Tomorrow!
Tonight we sleep.
Tomorrow you do the monolog.
I tell you, we want to be well-rested for that monolog, too.
Hey, we're at the door now, okay?
Bye-bye then.
You know, the whole reason I wanted Shawn to move in here was so I could get to know him.
And he won't let me.
I reach out, he resents me.
I try to be honest with him, he runs out.
Maybe this brother thing isn't going to work, man.
You know, maybe you're right.
Why don't you just, you know, walk away?
Then you won't be brothers anymore, right?
Yeah, I mean, we don't even know each other.
What makes us brothers in the first place?
Okay.
When I was 12, Cory and I went to a Phillies game.
My father gave me just enough money for two hot dogs, so, you know, I went and I bought two hot dogs.
Of course I realized by the time I got back to Cory, I ate them both.
Cory cried.
This is very sad.
That was the happy part.
You want sad?
I went up and down the aisle trying to collect money from people.
Get a dime here, a quarter there.
And I went and I bought Cory a hot dog.
Man, he was so happy.
He smiled.
And then I smiled, 'cause I felt good.
You know, I did the right thing.
I was a good older brother.
He started giggling, reached his little hand out for that hot dog and took a foul ball right smack-dab in the head.
Knocked him unconscious.
Cory doesn't giggle anymore.
Next to Wendy's unicorn monolog, that's the worst story I've ever heard.
You know something?
You're right.
That is a really bad story.
So, why don't you tell me one about your brother?
Hey.
Look who's here.
The documentary man.
South Philly, making movies.
Yeah, I figured you'd be here.
Gosh, I haven't been here since you moved to the trailer park.
Yeah.
You know, Jack lived here, too.
Although I'm sure he's forgotten.
So why don't you start rolling that thing, and we'll finish your movie.
No.
No, I'm not here for that.
That's not important anymore.
It is to me.
I've got something to say.
Turn it on.
I was seven when my dad first told me that I had a brother.
You know, I always wanted a brother.
I wondered what he looked like, if he'd like me, if he even knew about me.
When I was 10, I finally got the courage to write Jack a letter telling him all about me.
I didn't get an answer.
But I kept writing to him because he was my brother.
And I must have sent him, like, 15 letters, and I never got a single thing back.
So I knew that he didn't want to have anything to do with me, and he still doesn't.
I never got any letters.
What are you doing here?
My mom must have thrown them away without showing them to me.
I don't believe that.
You're ashamed of me.
You always were.
Shawn Let me go.
No.
You're not listening to him.
Okay?
Now listen to what he has to say.
Don't get in the middle of this.
No, the problem is, Shawn, I didn't get in the middle of this in the beginning.
You were behind your camera from the beginning.
I didn't realize what was going on.
Listen, it's not about my film anymore.
It's too personal now.
This is your life.
Give it a happy ending, okay?
Did she really throw them away?
I never got them, man.
But if you had, would you have written me back?
If I had known you wanted to see me, I would've gotten on a bus and found you.
Yeah?
I found you now, didn't I?
All I ever wanted was a brother.
Okay.
You got one.
And clean up this mess, will you?
This isn't my mess, this is your mess.
Clean up this mess, you pig.
Pig?
Did you just call me a pig?
My brother just called me a pig.
I think this might work out.
Yesterday, Shawn and I went out for a couple of hot dogs.
Not much of a story, but it's a start.
They go round and round.
I mean, that's what dries them.
I could've been a good Eric.
I wasn't given a chance.
He wasn't as good an Eric as he thought.
He coasted.
Took the job for granted.
We couldn't tell Morgan this, but he stole.
We found this in his backpack.
I'm thinking of putting my house up for sale.
I thought once the kids started getting older, things would quiet down, but it just gets weirder.
I've been meeting with the people at Disney.
They are very interested in my film.
They're talking three-picture deal.
Personally, I'm thinking about going the independent route.
Maybe the Sundance Film Festival.
I need to think.
This is the story of Jack, Shawn, and Eric.
Three new roommates.
They've been through a lot, and they've made it.
Now nothing will tear them apart.
You're breathing loud again.
So I'm a loud breather.
Why can't you breathe more like me?
What do I know?
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
And that, Mr. Hunter, is how babies are made.
I still don't believe him.
Before I forget, next Friday will be college recruitment day.
Representatives will be here from USC, NYU and Rutgers.
And Mr. Matthews, your interview with Stanford has been rescheduled from 3:00 to 3:30.
Stanford?
What's that all about?
It's just an interview.
It's nothing from nothing.
Cory.
When we were little kids, you promised me that we'd go to the same college together.
Did I say that?
Yes, and you also told me that if I graduated high school, you'd take me to Vermont to watch the leaves change.
Right, Vermont.
October.
Write it down.
You know I could never get into Stanford.
Well, Stanford's just one of the many schools I'm applying to, Shawn.
I'm also applying to Wisconsin, Penn.
Wisconsin and Penn?
We never discussed those.
Well, it doesn't have to be Wisconsin or Penn, Shawnie.
It can be a school from your list.
What's on your list?
You want to know what's on my list?
Number one, I don't need a list because my best friend Cory wouldn't apply to any school that I couldn't get into.
Your list makes me feel bad.
Shawn You know, it's early.
I have no idea what my plans are.
Oh, interesting.
Your plans.
Not our plans.
Hmm.
Don't you take that tone with me, Shawn Hunter.
I'm not taking any tone.
If you want to go to college at Stanford, then go.
In fact, go now.
Give you plenty of time to start making your new college friends.
But I don't want to make new friends.
You know what?
Maybe I should start making new friends, too, huh?
But I don't want you to make new friends.
Well, you need to, Cory.
What did you think?
That I was always going to be here?
Is that what you thought?
Well, I'm not.
Shawn, what about Vermont?
I put down a deposit.
Shawn, I think we need to talk.
No.
Everything's fine.
Our little conversation this morning was very helpful in making me realize that our entire relationship has been nothing more than a lie!
Move along, move along.
Just a couple of seniors rehearsing a little playlet.
Don't you think you're being a little dramatic about this?
Dramatic?
Perhaps a little.
Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go look out the window.
I paid a skywriter a lot of money to write "Cory, I hate you" in the clouds.
Shawn.
Cory, are you sure that you and Shawn are okay?
Oh, we're just fine.
He just spent a lot of money on me.
I think he needs to vent.
See, that's the beauty of our relationship, Topanga, you know?
I mean, it's rock solid, baby.
Who are you and what are you doing in my seat?
His name is Andy.
Who's Andy?
He's my new Best friend?
Friend.
Cory, we agreed that we were going to go out and meet new people.
I'm not making you happy?
No, Cory, it's It's not you, okay?
It's me.
And right now I just need my space.
But we're still friends?
Right now, I don't know what we are.
Give me my space.
He's got a new best friend.
You're jealous.
It's so cute.
No, no, no.
I'm not jealous.
But two can play at this game, girlfriend.
Hi.
Hi.
I'm Lionel.
I know who you are.
Grapes?
I'd love some.
I'm taking another boy's grapes.
Okay, first college paper.
Playing with the big boys.
Ten thousand words.
Word number one.
I want my mommy!
That's three words.
Come on, Eric.
You had three weeks to write this paper.
You don't make fun of my learning disability!
You have a learning disability?
I would think so.
Hey, wait.
What did you write yours about?
Well, all right.
Ooh, a laptop.
For your lap.
Here it is.
Ten thousand words.
A perfectly crafted essay on my summer in China working with paleontologists.
What?
Your first college paper, you're writing about what you did on your summer vacation.
I uncovered dinosaur fossils.
You got pictures?
No.
Then you got nothing.
I think it's pretty good.
You don't get it.
We're in college now.
We're being judged on a whole new level.
Theories and footnotes, shades of meaning, nuance, spelling.
Where does it end?
Where does it end?
All right!
I didn't even go!
My sister went.
She's 10.
I got no pictures.
And I didn't go to China.
Okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
I'm going to get us through this, all right, my friend?
This is where Eric Matthews shines.
How?
We pull an all-nighter?
Work together until it's great?
I got better.
We make friends with the dean.
Cor?
It's 6:00.
You're in your pajamas.
Is everything okay?
I don't want to talk about it.
Cory and Shawn had a fight.
Shawn dumped him.
Now, nobody got dumped.
We just agreed not to see each other for a while.
And you believe that?
Well, someone from school called, a Lionel.
Is that your new boyfriend?
He's just this guy from school.
If he calls again, tell him I'm not home.
That's no way to treat him.
He'll dump you, too.
Hey, everybody.
Hey, Cor.
I had lunch at Pink's today.
How come I didn't see you there?
Why would you?
Shawn was there.
Was he alone?
No.
He was with a couple of guys.
A couple of guys.
What are you so upset about?
Pink's was our place.
Not anymore.
Mother, make her stop.
Cory, what is going on?
I'll tell you what's going on.
It's two people moving in different directions, that's what.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going in the other room to watch Lifetime and have a good cry.
Is everything okay between him and Topanga?
Great.
Never better.
When they kiss, he enjoys it, right?
Let's just go home and write our papers, man.
No, no, no, no, no.
We're not gonna have to.
You see, the beauty of befriending the dean is he's going to give us an extension on the paper.
We're never going to have to do it, or any paper thereafter.
We're actually never going to have to do any real work until we graduate, get jobs, befriend our bosses, get married, befriend our wives.
Please, man, I just want to go to college.
I just want to do the work.
Hey, I like you too much to let you do that.
Oh, thanks, man.
Hey.
Oh, Dean?
Not now.
Okay.
Hey, hey, hey.
He's gonna love us.
Oh, Dean?
You don't listen, do you?
Jack, bow.
What?
Bow your head.
Sir, we'd actually just like to discuss with you a paper that we're writing and perhaps even establish the type of relationship I had with my former mentor, Mr. Feeny.
You know the kind of people that have mentors?
People who can't think for themselves.
Weak people.
You're in college now, buddy boy.
The big leagues.
The show.
I've got over 25,000 students in this university, and each one of them lined up to kiss my dean butt, looking for an easy way.
But I'm going to tell you something.
The only easy way is the hard way.
You don't say much, pretty boy.
I'm very scared, sir.
Good.
That's how I became the dean.
We are so in.
Cory, I know you and Shawn are having some problems right now.
I don't think this is the time to bring him up.
Did you know that Lionel has a really wonderful singing voice?
Cory, come here.
I want to tell you something.
Did you enjoy that?
Yes, ma'am.
Okay, good.
Now listen to me.
Being a senior is a very scary time.
We have a lot of decisions we need to make.
Yeah, I know that.
Okay.
And you're probably going to have your choice of schools to go to all over the country.
Yeah, but that doesn't mean Shawn has to be upset with me for that.
He's not.
He's just afraid that his best friend is moving on and leaving him behind.
You know, you're right.
I mean, he's probably off somewhere alone, miserable.
He's in denial.
Three guys.
I'm only with Lionel.
Cory, talk to him.
Shawn?
Boys.
Well, this certainly appears to be a lot more than just giving each other space.
Cory, we agreed that we were going to make new friends.
No, you agreed.
I was perfectly happy with the way things were.
Then explain him!
His name is Lionel.
We met today, and we are getting along just famously because I'm young, Hunter, I'm vital, and I have a lot to offer.
Yeah, well, so do I. The difference is I have the dignity to keep my friendships personal and private, not parade them around in public for your twisted amusement.
You little punk!
You dirty man!
Cat fight.
Face it, Matthews.
Our friendship never made any sense in the first place.
You're right.
Why?
Because we're different.
You're college.
I'm townie.
It was only a matter of time before that caught up with us.
Then let's end it now before it lasts any longer than it did.
No!
Now.
Come on, boys.
Cory, why do I have to be here?
Lionel, it's no secret that Shawn and I went through a pretty brutal breakup.
Now, things could get ugly.
And if a punch gets thrown, well, I need you to take it.
I will do that for you.
Okay, great.
Now, knowing Shawn and how vindictive he is, he probably has no intention of giving me my stuff back.
Where does it end?
Shawn?
I know you're in there.
Not answering.
He must be hurting.
Gosh, I'm loving this.
Kirk, it's about time Oh.
It's you.
I'm having a party.
What?
Yeah.
A party, right.
That certainly is some shindig.
Yeah, you know.
Just pounding down some sodas, swapping a few stories with some close friends.
Close friends?
You hardly know them.
Exactly.
So if they leave, who cares?
Get out, all of you!
Now get back in there!
You see, no emotional attachment, nobody gets hurt.
That's my kind of friendship, baby.
So, this is it.
I guess so.
Well, it's been a fun run.
It has been.
Hey.
Remember the time we ate cake in the Paramus mall?
Cory, please don't.
No emotion.
It's too hard.
Have a nice, you know Whatever.
I don't hate you.
Just go.
Lionel, we're through here.
Lionel?
Lionel.
If you guys ever play basketball, make sure there's plenty of water around because Cory tends to dehydrate.
Lionel.
And let him win once in a while.
He likes that.
And, Lionel, never eat cake in Paramus.
That's ours.
Dean Borack!
Dean Borack!
Look, I was a very good student in high school.
I can write this paper.
I'm going home.
Fine, go.
High school boy.
What was that about?
What?
Nothing.
Didn't mean a thing.
Just that high school was a very important time in your life.
Probably the best years you're ever going to have.
You won a few spelling bees, you took out the prom queen, you peaked early.
Good for you.
Dean Borack!
Huh?
Hello, Dean.
Eric Matthews.
My chum Jack.
I was wondering if you could put on a pot of coffee, invite us in, and perhaps we could discuss the extension on our papers.
We brought a babka.
A babka?
You bums think you're going to buy me off with a stinking babka?
Hildy.
We're going to meet his daughter.
You're going to meet my Doberman.
Make no mistake about it, boys, I am a nasty, nasty man.
Leave the babka.
Mr. Feeny?
Mr. Feeny!
I was expecting you.
Today, tomorrow, yesterday.
It was only a matter of time.
Look, Mr. Feeny.
This is my roommate, Jack.
Why doesn't he look at me?
I'm afraid, sir.
Mr. Feeny, we're both scared, okay?
Tomorrow we've got to hand in our first college paper.
What if they find out we're nothing more than fakes?
Gentlemen, getting accepted into college is not a random act.
You both were accepted on your merits.
And by virtue of that alone, you belong.
Now, what's the topic of your paper?
It's an open assignment.
You can write on anything you want.
No rules, no guidelines, no parameters.
It doesn't even have to be in English.
You're kidding, right?
Hmm?
No.
Okay, well, the best advice I can give you is to write about something personal.
Perhaps about the anxiety you're feeling.
Yes.
That's it!
The anxiety.
Mr. Feeny!
Feeny and Eric back together again.
Just like the old days.
I make you look so good.
What about you?
I was thinking of handing in a paper I wrote about uncovering dinosaur fossils in China.
You got pictures?
Then you got nothing.
Mr. Feeny.
I got a message you wanted to see me.
You have two extra tickets to Sunday's Eagles game.
Hey, Mr. Feeny.
I heard you had an academic achievement award for me?
You!
You!
Sting!
Sting!
Oh, sit down!
Mr. Feeny, why are you doing this to us?
I asked him to see you.
Topanga!
Topanga!
You won't listen to me.
You won't listen to each other.
Maybe you'll listen to Mr. Feeny.
Well, it hasn't happened yet.
But I'll take a shot at it.
Okay, who wants to start?
I have nothing to say.
Me neither.
Okay, that was my best shot.
What?
Mr. Feeny, these people are about ready to throw away and you call that your best shot?
Shame on you.
Shame.
I show up.
I teach.
Why isn't that enough?
Why?
Look, Mr. Feeny, let's not waste anyone's time, okay?
Cory and I, we broke up.
It should have happened sooner.
But we stayed together for the kids.
In the class.
You two have been the best of friends for as long as I know you.
Now, when did this problem start?
His problem started the day he met me.
You didn't think I was good enough for you since the day you met me.
The day he met me.
Met me.
Hey!
Want to have lunch with me?
I don't think I should.
Those guys say that you live in a trailer park and I shouldn't like you.
Oh, well.
If you want to have lunch with me, I'll be right here.
Hey, Topanga.
Look, I'm a llama.
Look, I'm a Whoa!
Whoa!
Cory, I told you not to play by the llamas!
Help!
Help!
Somebody, help!
Help!
Help!
Hey, thanks for pulling me out of the llama pen.
It was fun.
My name's Cory.
I'm Shawn.
Hi.
I'm Topanga.
The wife.
I'm sorry I didn't have lunch with you.
My friends were wrong.
They're not even my friends.
I'll be your friend.
Really?
Just promise me when we grow up, you won't go to college and leave me.
Okay.
Friends forever?
Forever.
Stop it.
You're boys.
Stop it.
You're boys.
Thank you for pulling me out of the llama pen.
Thank you for having lunch with me.
Oh, here we go.
Cory, I want you to go to the best college you can get into.
We'll be best friends all our lives, no matter where you go.
And I should have been more aware of your insecurities and how sensitive you can be.
Do you think I'm sensitive?
I do.
You know what, Cor?
I'm going to work real hard.
So whatever college you get into, I'll be right there with you.
You mean it?
I've never meant anything more in my whole life.
Okay, stop it!
Okay.
We still all have to be ready for the possibility we may end up in different places.
And that's why we have to make our senior year together the best year of our lives.
I mean, I applied to the University of Miami Whoa, whoa, whoa!
You're going to Miami?
You know, I did tell you that.
If you didn't listen, that's not my fault.
No, Topanga, you never mentioned anything You two.
Sit down.
Well, it all started the day she was nagging me by the llama pit.
I don't nag!
Ah!
Hi, Dean.
It's about time, sir.
How did you get in here?
It's after hours.
This building is locked.
You're trespassing, you know that?
You're violating my personal property.
I could have you both shock-therapied.
Look, Dean.
We really need that extension.
In my entire which spans five colleges on three continents, including China Okay, just bought us a month.
You speak Chinese?
I do.
Cool.
All right.
Let's celebrate.
Dean's house?
And insult him by going anywhere else?
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Hey, Lisa from 3-B, care to join my study group?
Why are you studying in the hall?
So I can talk to girls.
Knock yourself out.
You're pretty.
Back at you.
Hey, thank you.
Hey, Jack.
Please tell me you were just trying to get out of a traffic ticket.
Will you stop?
I passed by the Gamma Epsilon fraternity.
There's a big party.
All the girls were there, so I pledged.
Yeah, but doesn't that make you feel, like, humiliated, man?
Yes, it does.
I paid $200 for this dress.
I'm never going to get to wear it again.
College is easy.
So I guess this is where Eric and Jack study, huh?
Study?
Oh, my dear, sweet, little Cory.
Let me show you what college is all about, okay?
Hi.
I'm Shawn Hunter.
Jennifer Crane from 3-B.
You guys live here?
I do indeedy.
That's college talk.
So, how do you like Pennbrook?
Oh, no, no.
Shawn doesn't go to I love Pennbrook.
Old buildings, pretty girls.
So you're taking Introduction to Western Philosophy?
Yes, I am.
Another relationship starting off on a lie.
So, I'll see you in class tomorrow?
Okay.
I'll save you a seat.
Would you look at that?
First day of college, and I got me a girlfriend.
Now, who can tell me what's wrong with that sentence?
I can.
I know, Miss Lawrence, but you're already 10 for 10.
Oh, why don't we try Mr. Matthews?
Mmm, he won't know this one.
Mr. Matthews?
She's 11 for 11.
You know, I'm not surprised that no one knows the answer to that question.
I do.
Many of you have forgotten the basics.
Now, this is alarming because you'll be entering college next fall Mr. Hunter?
Huh?
Clipping coupons?
Yep.
Odor-Eaters.
$2.49 for a dozen, and my Christmas shopping is done.
This is your senior year, your last chance, Mr. Hunter.
If you don't apply yourself now, how do you expect to make it in college?
I don't.
Uh, Mr. Feeny.
Listen, I'm worried about Shawn.
Isn't there anything you can do to help him?
I've been trying for four years.
What more would you have me do, Mr. Matthews?
Hi.
Major fraternity party Friday night.
I'm the head cheese at the fraternity, and I can't wait to see you all there.
Singles only, okay?
No children.
Great.
I'll see you.
Fraternity party!
Fraternity party, Friday night!
Hey, buddy.
Eric, this fraternity party's at our apartment.
Yes, it is.
You know, you were absolutely right.
That hazing was so humiliating, I came up with my own idea.
I'm going to start a fraternity of my own.
That way, the girls will come to me.
I don't have to wear a dress anymore.
Unless, you know, I want to.
When the dean finds out what you're doing, man, he's gonna kick you out of school.
No!
See, the dean adores me.
Why are you in my college hallway?
I'm passing out flyers.
Everybody's got a flyer.
If it ain't the chess guys, it's the drama freaks.
Save this, conserve that.
Ever since Kinko's opened, everybody's flyer crazy.
I think you're going to like this one, buddy.
Good old-fashioned fraternity party.
And it's all his idea.
I'm on my way to the library, sir.
Why is your name on it?
Why is my name on it?
We're the founding members.
What's the name of your fraternity?
It's It's Magnum Pi.
Started at the University of Hawaii.
Hey!
You ever heard of this Magnum Pi?
Get out of here.
He's not right in the head.
Hey, Topanga, listen, I'm glad you're here.
Feeny's on the warpath because Shawn's cutting classes, so I'm writing an excuse from Shawn's parents.
How do you spell Shawn?
You don't know how to spell your best friend's name?
Well, we're phone people.
Is it S-H-A-W-N or S-E-A-N?
It's S-H-A-W-N, and where is he?
Jennifer.
Hi, Shawn.
Come down here.
I saved a seat for you.
No.
Why don't you come on and sit in the back?
You, stop talking and take a seat down here.
When we left off yesterday, we were analyzing French philosopher Jacques Buridan's paradox.
A hungry dog is placed an equal distance between two bowls containing equal amounts of food.
Which does he choose?
Not me.
Not me.
Jennifer.
Buridan concluded that the dog would starve to death, implying that we can only choose that which our reason tells us is the greater good.
Refute this argument using dialectic reasoning.
You.
Um Well, I think the dog would choose the food on the right.
That's one way to go.
Why not the left?
Okay, the left.
Doesn't really matter.
I mean, anybody would eat something before they starved to death.
Did the rest of you see what he just did there?
He skipped right ahead to Schopenhauer's theory that the will to live is the predominant human trait.
Name?
Shawn.
Non-linear thinking.
Good.
Wow!
Schopenhauer.
That's like graduate level.
Really?
I like the way your mind works.
Free will.
Want to take a shot?
Do I really have a choice?
Ooh!
I got to take five.
Shawnie.
Hey, finally working on your paper for Feeny's class, huh?
Actually, I'm writing a biography on Schopenhauer.
The comic or the singer?
The philosopher.
But, you know, I wouldn't expect you to know that.
It's not stuff that they cover in high school.
You're still pretending to be in college, so you can impress that girl Jennifer, huh?
Cory, this isn't even about her anymore.
I like philosophy, and I'm good at it.
Yeah, but, Shawn, we always said that we're gonna end up in college together.
I mean, if you don't finish high school, that's never going to happen.
I'm already in college.
Obviously, I don't need high school.
We got Feeny, okay?
Let's go.
Cory, Cory, no, come on.
I got to write my philosophy paper.
Okay, fine, but that's it, Shawn, all right?
I will not compromise my name and cover for you again.
Mr. Matthews, where is Mr. Hunter?
Alaska?
That remark will cost you a 500-word essay.
Mr. Feeny, come on, I'm just trying to help out a friend here.
Make that 1,000 words on what helping out a friend really means.
Mr. Feeny, don't you think you're being a little harsh on Cory?
I mean, he waters your plants when you're out of town.
Two thousand words.
That's not fair.
He didn't even say anything.
Miss Lawrence, you just bought the entire class the same assignment.
And I want it by tomorrow.
Oh!
What?
Now, perhaps someone can tell me where Mr. Hunter is.
Excuse me.
I don't know if this makes up for anything, but lunch is on us, huh?
Mr. Hunter, class has begun.
I suggest you join us.
Thanks for the invite, but I've got to finish this paper.
I'm not asking you, Mr. Hunter.
This is high school.
I'm the teacher and you're the student.
Well, that certainly is one point of view, but I believe that there's still room for discussion.
Are you refusing to come to class?
No, I am not refusing.
I am exercising my free will.
Then I will exercise mine.
You are hereby suspended.
End of discussion.
Suspended students are not allowed in school.
Now, I have a room full of students who want to learn, so good day, Mr. Hunter.
Shawn.
How could you do this to him?
This is his senior year.
How can you suspend him?
He suspended himself.
If he wants to join all the others who failed to live up to their potential, that is his choice.
But it's Shawn.
Yes, I know.
I don't want to talk about it, okay?
Yeah, well, I do.
You took that out of my closet.
I'm pledging Omega, all right?
The dean thinks I'm in a fraternity, let him think I'm in a real fraternity.
I love him, okay?
And he loves me.
Eric, he doesn't love you.
Oh, yeah?
If he doesn't love me, how come he's coming to see me right now, then, hmm?
Eric.
Hi, Shelly.
Listen, Matthews, I happen to have a niece who attends the University of Hawaii in Oahu, and she has no knowledge of this Magnum Pi.
What do you make of that?
Well, we have no Oahu chapter.
However, we are very big on the island of Humina Humina Humina Who.
How are you funded?
Alumni.
I want names.
You!
I don't know.
You're out of school.
Famous celebrity alumni.
Well, I would love to know who.
Love to know who.
Love.
Love Love Boat.
The Love Boat's Ted Lange and Bernie Kopell, sir.
Oh!
What fun!
Well, I'll look forward to meeting them at your fraternity party.
And as soon as you started talking, I knew you were Jack.
Come inside, you hussy.
Look, not everybody is going to get Nietzsche right away.
The key is to read it in its original German.
Tutor me.
Okay.
Today we're going to explore structuralism.
Psst, hey!
What are you doing here?
Listen, you've got to come back and talk to Feeny, okay?
This is nonsense.
You don't belong here.
You!
Oh, my God, I've been hit.
Life, mortality, existence.
What are your thoughts?
Oh, I'm just visiting.
Oh.
Like in, "We're all just visiting.
" Yes.
Yes.
Exactly.
That's bull!
See?
This is what happens in philosophy class.
You throw out a few cliches, and I'm supposed to be impressed.
I'm not!
I wish I wasn't here.
Now, see?
That's a good starting point.
I'm sorry.
Sometimes I just get a little frustrated.
I look at you and wonder how many of you should still be in high school.
Here are your papers.
Listen, are you going to come back or not?
Cory, I belong here.
Shawn, I was very surprised by yours.
Yes, sir.
I was expecting a scholarly work of real accomplishment.
An "F".
I didn't even get yours.
I don't believe this.
Listen, Shawn, it's okay.
I mean, you're not in this class anyway.
No, no, this has got to be a mistake.
I really know this stuff.
I've got to talk to him.
Excuse me, Professor.
I worked really hard on this paper.
I don't understand.
Shawn, except for a few promising ideas, it was poorly written.
It was disorganized and sloppily researched.
But you said I had a good mind.
You do.
But you're in college.
You're supposed to know the basics.
I don't have time to teach them to you.
Okay, class, let's move on.
I don't belong in high school.
I don't belong in college.
Listen, talk to Feeny.
You!
Schopenhauer.
Me.
Leaving.
Yeah, it's good to have you on board, Jack.
Yeah, well, the only reason I'm here is because as long as I wore that dress, I couldn't shake the dean.
Then let the fraternity party games begin.
Girls, to the closet.
All right.
Freeze!
You two think I'm a clown, don't you?
Dean Bozo!
Well, it's been fun toying with you, but now I'm bored.
We all know there's no Magnum Pi, but what really fries my dean butt is you promised I'd get a chance to mingle with The Love Boat's Ted Lange and Bernie Kopell.
Jack, take my hand and pray.
What are you, scared, man?
You're not?
Not at all.
Can I fix anybody a drink?
Ted!
Look, Dean, The Love Boat guys.
Why do you always have to do the finger thing?
'Cause I know you hate it.
You still resent me for outranking you on the boat.
Bernie, you do know that you're not a real doctor, right?
You called them?
Of course I called them, man.
I want to live.
I want to stay in school.
Ted Lange, Bernie Kopell, I'm the dean here at Pennbrook University.
A fan from way back.
As the two most prominent celebrity alumni of Magnum Pi, we would like to say we couldn't be prouder of our Pennbrook chapter and the dean who supports it.
Can I fix anybody a drink?
They have drinks, and it's getting old.
Boys, you both proved something to me today.
I was drunk when I hired the dean of admissions.
You poodles actually believe that I'd be impressed by a couple of guys from Love Boat?
No offense.
Big fan.
Hey, we don't care.
We get paid either way.
All right, boys, first thing tomorrow morning, consider Magnum Pi closed.
Right now, Bernie and Ted, you're coming home to meet my mom.
We ordinarily do just one appearance a night.
She's a big Get Smart fan.
Well, I don't suppose it would kill us to stop by.
Bernie, you know you're not the head of a secret organization known as KAOS, right?
Well, Jack, tomorrow we're closed.
But tonight, we're open.
Ladies To the closet!
George, hi.
We just got back from Glaciers.
You in the mood for a yogurt?
Why can't I offer him a yogurt?
Do you not understand the concept of a whisper?
I think this might have something to do with my suspending Shawn Hunter.
You suspended Shawn?
Can you believe that?
Shawn's senior year.
His most important year, and Feeny suspends him.
Mr. Matthews, Shawn was skipping class, mouthing off to me.
He practically asked to be suspended.
Fine.
Okay, fine.
But this is Shawn here.
Every year, I watch bright kids like Shawn fall through the cracks.
How do you think it feels?
Cory, this isn't Mr. Feeny's fault.
You should give him another chance.
He's given me plenty of chances.
Look, Mr. Feeny, I I didn't treat you with the respect that you deserve.
Come on, let's take these yogurts inside.
Are you asking to come back to school, Shawn?
Yes.
Yes, he is.
He is.
I shouldn't be wasting any of Mr. Feeny's time.
You've never wasted any of my time.
Mr. Feeny, did you know that Shawn's taking college courses at Pennbrook?
Is that right, Shawn?
I guess it's like Buridan's paradox.
There were two bowls placed in front of me.
One was high school and one was college.
I chose college.
Why don't you show him your paper?
It's no good.
May I read it?
It's just an "F".
You know, another "F" to add to the scrapbook.
Well, I can see you have some grammar problems here.
And the structure is way off.
This entire paper is in one sentence.
But it's good.
Clearly, college level.
Really?
'Cause, you know, I was kind of enjoying college.
For the first time, I saw myself there.
I always saw you there.
So did I. But, Shawn, you must come back to class.
You have to learn the basics, and I'm going to keep teaching it.
That is my philosophy.
And every now and then, I'll throw in a little Schopenhauer for you.
What do you know about Schopenhauer?
Probably not as much as you do, but I'm willing to learn.
So, Bernie, Ted, don't you just love my family?
Oh!
We had a wonderful evening.
You're really delightful people, but we really should be heading back to the airport.
Oh, nonsense!
Come on, one more story.
It's not every day we get to meet a couple celebrities from the TV, huh?
Okay.
One more story.
When Cory was seven, he fell off of his bicycle The tooth fairy story.
That's a good one.
With the teeth.
We already heard this one.
When?
Six hours ago.
For the love of God, let us go!
No, you sit.
My son paid you.
You sit and you listen to my wife's stories.
Bernie, I'm scared.
Love Boat stalkers.
How'd you like to live here?
Anyway, Cory looked under his pillow.
But that's not the story.
This is the story.
This is so good.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Jackie!
Come on, move your behind.
We've got a club full of pretty ladies waiting for us.
You should just go without me.
I'm not real good in the clubs.
you're with me.
I know.
I'm always with you.
New guy in town, don't know a lot of people, so I get to tag along.
Come on, Jack.
This is a no frowning zone.
And you don't just tag along.
Now get behind me.
I'm just uncomfortable picking up girls.
Watch and learn.
What are you doing?
Loving you with my eyes.
Please don't.
The ladies love it.
Come on.
So if the ladies love it, how come you don't have a girlfriend?
I don't know.
Hi.
Hi, I'm Eric Alison Matthews.
You know, you're the reason we have campus escorts.
Yes, I am.
You must be Jack Hunter.
How'd you know that?
I like to know who my neighbors are.
I'm Millie from 3-B.
Well, Millie from 3-B, we're heading down to O'Dooley's.
Why don't you join us?
I'm not much of a club person.
Neither am I. You're cute.
Why don't you show me your apartment?
Sure.
Are you kidding me?
Hello!
Hello!
Anybody home?
Nobody's home?
Goodbye, pants.
Eric!
Eric, buddy, what are you doing home?
They turned O'Dooley's into a Starbucks.
I was into my third dance before I noticed.
Look, I'm sorry you had a bad night, but I got Millie out there.
Ooh.
My manners.
I'll go say hello.
Hi, Millie.
You know, I'm really glad you and Jack hooked up.
He doesn't have a lot of friends here.
It's very important for me to have Jack.
Don't get in my way.
You know, Jack, I'm really glad you met somebody, but don't you find her a little freaky?
Why?
Because she chose me instead of you?
I didn't even think of that.
Come in!
We can't move.
Hey, Millie!
I was up all night thinking about you.
What's he doing here?
Gee, I don't know, Mill.
I live here.
I brought breakfast for you, Jack.
Smells good, doesn't it?
Why don't we go have it out on the balcony?
Millie, too bad!
So sad!
You're gonna be eating all by yourself.
You see, Jack and I are running up the Rocky steps today.
But, Jack, I planned the rest of your life.
I mean, day.
I thought we'd take a nice long walk and then come back and sit outside and wait for dark.
Stop!
Stop!
Stop that!
Now, we've been stretching for this jog since September.
We're finally limber.
Why is he attacking me?
Eric, you're upsetting Millie, okay?
I would love to spend the day with you.
"Millie, I would love to spend the day with you.
" Good, you're still here.
I got up early to give you a send-off for the big jog.
Hey, who wants Rocky hats?
Thank you, Shawn.
That's sweet of you.
But see, he's not going.
He chose her over me.
Don't you see what she's doing to you, Jack?
Hugging you, holding you, kissing you!
It's just wrong.
Millie, this is Shawn.
I'm Jack's brother.
Oh, another Hunter.
So nice to meet you.
Great apartment.
I love your balcony.
We have a balcony?
That's for me.
My roommates want to see your balcony.
Hi.
Hey, I want to see it, too.
And now we return to the frightening conclusion of Halloween, Part 9.
Hi.
How did you get in here?
Jack made me a set.
Bug you?
Hey, Mill.
Hi!
Jack, we have to talk.
Fine.
Talk to him.
He belongs to me now.
Boy, she really loves it out there.
You made her keys?
She's my girlfriend.
Oh, yeah?
What's her last name, Jack?
I don't have to answer that.
What do you have against her?
I don't know, man.
It's hard to find the words.
Mean, creepy, evil, cold-hearted.
Actually, once you get started, it just kind of What is your problem?
I meet someone.
I'm happy.
You are not happy!
You're just a sweet, dumb farm kid who picked up with the first pretty girl who flashes him a smile.
I'm from New York City!
That town ain't so tough!
Look, sweetie, I'm just trying to look out for you.
All right?
I'm trying to make sure you're not gonna get hurt.
I'm just trying to be your friend.
If your idea of being my friend is to stop me from having a girlfriend, maybe you should stick to being my roommate.
Fine!
Fine!
Fine!
Cory, you, me, and a weekend in Pittsburgh.
Can you think of anything more romantic?
Yeah, a weekend in Pittsburgh without your parents.
We'll have plenty of time alone during our long, intimate drive up.
There's not gonna be any driving.
What are these?
Two plane tickets to Steel Town.
We are gonna be kissing There's no way I can fly.
Why not?
Because I'm morally opposed to it.
What?
Flying?
I thought you said hunting whales.
Wait a minute.
You're afraid to fly.
No, I'm not.
I don't think I am.
I don't know.
Cory, I've never been on a plane before.
No!
Come on.
Everyone's been on a plane.
Horses go on planes.
Well, I don't, and I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't make fun of me.
Okay, I'm sorry.
Why don't we discuss this fear of flying over a nice dinner?
Or are you afraid of restaurants, too?
If you want to be insensitive, then you can eat alone.
You know, you used to think I was funny.
Lord of Darkness, ruler of the anguished, on All Hallows' Eve, your work will be done, but there is one who stands in the way.
Hey, Millie, man.
Am I the one who's standing in the way?
How much did you hear?
I heard you talking to Satan.
Hey, guys, I got the pizza.
Ow!
Jack, did you just see that?
He tried to kiss me!
You creep!
She was talking to Satan!
What?
Jack, I think she's a witch, and not a good witch like Glinda, but a bad witch, like with the monkeys!
Are you gonna let him talk to me like this?
You know, I don't believe you, man.
For the first time, I'm doing something without you, you can't handle it and you try to take my girlfriend.
She doesn't belong to you, Jack.
She belongs to el diablo.
You just can't stand it 'cause the new guy in town doesn't need your help.
All right, all right, that's it.
I'm not gonna talk about this anymore, all right?
You gotta make a choice, man.
It's either her or me.
You're just my roommate, Eric.
Millie is much, much more than that.
We're waiting.
He chose me.
When?
All right, wait a second.
I'm not moving out.
Well, it's up to you 'cause I'm moving in.
I can't believe you're letting her move in here.
She's only staying for a few days, okay?
She's having trouble with her roommates.
What's the problem?
They don't like evil?
She's a witch, Jack.
Stop calling her names!
I see a cauldron.
It's Halloween.
It sets the mood.
So, Rosemary, how's the baby?
Look, okay.
We're gonna be living together.
Let's at least try to get along.
Hey, where's she gonna sleep, her beloved balcony?
Actually, yes.
You got yourself a good one there, Jack.
Get off my back, Matthews.
You know something?
Fine.
I'm off your back.
I thought you and I were friends.
I guess I was wrong.
I'm just another name on your lease.
Do you believe him, calling Millie a witch?
She's not?
I assumed she was.
What are you saying?
I'm saying she's a witch.
At least, that's what I heard.
Anyway, I'm gonna go help the rest of the coven.
Hey, Barbie, let me get that box for you.
There's something breathing in here.
Millie.
Hi.
Hi.
Look, I don't know your last name and I'm okay with that, but there's something I gotta know.
Are you a witch?
I am.
Does that bother you?
Never dated a witch before.
Well, this isn't the 16th century, Jack.
Witchcraft isn't spooky.
It's just a belief.
Actually, we do a lot of good.
For instance, our Pittsburgh chapter works with inner-city kids.
I didn't know that.
Well, then maybe you should check!
Sweetie, you do what you have to do, but just know that no one will ever feel about you the way that I do.
No one.
I love you.
I know you do.
Tomorrow is October We're going to have a party, I'm going to introduce you to all your new friends.
We're going to have fun.
Fun.
Okay, please tell me this is the shuttle that takes us to the real plane.
Topanga, it's a real plane.
It's a real airline.
How much did you pay for the tickets?
$12.
It's a good deal because they just got out of bankruptcy.
Cory, this is my first flight.
Please don't make jokes.
Listen, I know you're worried, okay?
But rest assured.
A good plane is like a fine wine.
It only gets better with age.
Welcome aboard.
I'm Captain Dexter Jorgenson.
Because of the nature of these smaller airplanes, I'm gonna have to redistribute some of the weight for takeoff.
Ma'am, you're perfect right where you are.
Sir, could you take that seat over there?
Got it.
Okay.
Just go to my happy place.
Bunnies.
Cute little bunnies.
Cute little bunnies in tiny, crashing planes.
Cory, please get over here now!
I have to wait for the ding.
Oh.
Ding.
Well, we have definitely learned one thing.
You are not a good flyer.
And you are going to make a very insensitive husband.
For somebody else.
Hey, you're Eric Matthews' brother.
Yes.
Yeah, I went to school with Eric.
Say hi to him.
Captain.
When you say you went to school with Eric, you mean you were his teacher, right?
Yeah!
Teacher, that's funny.
No, Eric used to tutor me.
Smart kid, your brother.
Wish I had his brains.
I wouldn't be doing this.
Come on, Mr. Feeny.
Will you please just give me the candy?
Say "trick or treat.
" It's the rules.
Trick or treat.
Say it with vigor, like you mean it.
Trick or treat!
That's better.
Now, to prove that it was worth the effort, a pocket thesaurus for each of you.
And some candy.
Here you go.
Okay, skadoodle.
Mr. Feeny, can I crash at your place tonight?
No.
Why?
I had a fight with Jack about his girlfriend.
The same old story.
Sure you heard it a thousand times.
She's a witch, she talks to the devil, and apparently I'm standing between her and the doorway to hell.
You're definitely not sleeping here.
I know, but of all the nights to fight.
I mean, Halloween!
This is the one holiday that's supposed to bring loved ones together.
Yes, well, I'm sure your friendship is strong enough that you'll endure a little argument.
Friends aren't supposed to let girls come between them.
But Jack has made it perfectly clear that I'm just his roommate.
I don't know why I'm letting this bug me.
Well, if he was just your roommate, you wouldn't be out here talking to me.
Now, Eric, just think of some way to get him to hear you.
You didn't even break a sweat on this one.
I hate to see people fight on the only holiday that brings loved ones together.
Merry Halloween, Mr. Feeny.
Mr. Feeny, hello.
Hi.
It's me, Cory.
Happy Halloween.
Listen, I need your help.
I'm sure you do.
No, no, I need you to look up someone named Dexter Jorgenson in your school records.
Mr. Matthews, those files are personal and confidential.
Why do you ask?
He's my pilot.
Uh-oh.
Whatever you do, don't get on that plane.
Goodbye, Mr. Feeny!
I love you very much!
I'm sure you'll be fine, Cory.
I lost him.
Topanga Oh, no, Topanga, I've lost you, too!
No, Cory, I'm right here.
What are you doing?
Well, Dexter heard that this was my first time flying and that I was afraid, and, unlike you, he cared, so he asked me to come up here and face my fears, and now I'm flying the plane.
Dexter?
Yes, my copilot?
Is it all right if I see what this bird can do?
Go for it.
No!
Come on, Jack, chant.
Just open your soul and let the spirit take you to the place where darkness reigns.
Can't we just bob for apples?
Okay, I want to thank whoever provided the shrouds.
Mine's a little snug.
Anyone want to trade a medium for a large?
I love Halloween!
How come everyone's wearing the same costume?
It's not a costume!
My mistake.
Can we try that one over again 'cause I wasn't ready.
Three, two, one.
All right!
Now we're wailing!
Party!
Hey, you in the shroud, get the door.
That's great.
One for the little pirate, one for the little mermaid And a little witch.
You don't get any because you mock us!
It's time.
Millie, I want to break up.
I'm not Millie.
I'm Ushkar, Queen of Malevolence, daughter of evil.
Ushkar, I want to break up.
It is time for the sacred light beam!
Shawn, we're in trouble here.
Lighten up, Jack.
Have some fun.
It's a Halloween party.
Okay, this part sucks.
Eric was right.
You lied to us, and you turned us against each other.
Why?
We needed your apartment, you fool.
From this exact spot, your balcony, once in 1,000 years, Valaris will come into alignment and Satan's tail will appear, sending a light beam through the Crystal of Death, ensuring our immortality and obliterating you.
Shawn.
What?
It started to get fun again.
It is written that in this very spot, on this very night, a Hunter will be sacrificed.
Two Hunters are even sweeter.
How about two Hunters and a Matthews?
Eric!
You've come to save us!
He wouldn't know how to save you.
Oh, yeah?
Went to the bookstore last night, picked this up.
The Bridges of Madison County?
And this, Witchcraft For Dumb-Dumbs.
Yep, think they mention a counter-spell in here somewhere.
It's too late.
It's time for the sacrificial beam!
Yeah, just hold on a second there, Ishtar.
Prepare to die the death of 1,000 deaths!
Here it is.
Ow!
Hot!
Hot!
Hot!
That's impossible!
The light beam hit you, and you're alive.
Yep.
Sunscreen.
SPF 45.
Plus a little zinc oxide on my bum.
Maybe next time, Satan.
Sorry, guys.
Yeah, it's a shame.
Shut up.
Come on, everybody out!
Scram!
Satan's children, be gone with you all!
Come on!
It's too bad.
You're cute.
You're sweet.
You'd have been the perfect sacrifice.
I appreciate that.
Hey, Millie.
Keys.
You know, it's a shame you didn't fall for me.
It could've been good.
Eric, when I saw that light beam, was that real?
Jack, maybe it was, maybe it wasn't.
There are some things just too big for our puny heads to comprehend.
Well, it's still Halloween.
I'm gonna go find another party.
Come on, Jack.
Eric, wait.
Even after all the rotten things I've said to you, you're still gonna invite me to come along?
Of course, man.
You're my friend.
Well, I know that now.
I'm a pretty lucky guy, man.
I'm buying.
You better!
Gotta love Halloween.
Really brings people together.
I love this balcony.
You do?
Yeah, it's got a great view of the river.
And you can see that guy watching TV in his underwear.
I've seen him.
I was actually just wondering if seeing Valaris did anything for you.
Is that his name?
Why are you so nervous?
I'm sorry, Sabrina.
My buddy just came off kind of a spooky relationship.
He was dating a Well, I'll just say it.
He was dating a witch.
What's so spooky about that?
So, what's next?
I don't know.
I figure maybe we'll go get a bite to eat.
Is that good?
All right, cool.
Hey, Shawn!
Want us to pick you up something, man?
No, thanks!
I'm feeling a little bloated.
See you, Shawn.
You gotta love Halloween.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Those darn hippies.
They talk about free love, then they want me to chip in for gas, like I've got a wallet.
Hypocrites.
And so the United States entered World War II on December 7, 1941.
As FDR said, "A day that will live in infamy.
" I want to thank those of you who brought in some of your family mementos.
It helped to show that this war was not just a point in history, but an event that touched all our lives.
Thank you.
Hey, listen, can I see that picture of your grandparents again?
Sure.
Wow.
They look very much in love.
Yeah.
They still are.
You know, he asked her to marry him on December 7, 1941.
Wait, I know that date.
Help me out here.
Pearl Harbor, the day that will live in infamy.
Feeny was just talking about it.
You listened to Feeny.
Oh, my God.
I listened to Feeny.
Wait.
So how old were they when they got married?
They were our age.
Wow.
Hey, kitty, are you lost?
You know, Cory, my grandpa never knew if he'd make it home, but that's the way it was back then.
People never knew how their lives would turn out.
I know.
I don't know how I'd handle living back then.
You know, I wonder what it was like during World War II.
And away we go.
Come again?
Well, I said I'm glad the US of A ain't mixed up in this war because I could never be away from my best gal.
I could never be away from you, kiddo.
Attention, everyone.
Please?
It is with great sadness that I must inform you that the United States has entered the war.
May God be with us all.
Cory, we're going down to enlist.
Uncle Sam wants us.
I wasn't going to go, but he was pointing right at me.
We're going to defend our country, Cor.
Are you coming with us?
So that's it.
We ship out tomorrow.
So that's it.
We ship out tomorrow.
Oh, no.
Surely the Army can make do without at least one of my men.
They wouldn't take me.
I have flat feet and I'm too ticklish.
Apparently, I'm a torture risk.
Eric, you'll be staying home with me?
Air raid!
Air raid!
Take it easy, everybody.
Stay calm.
It's just me.
Practicing to be neighborhood air raid warden.
They say I can keep this if we win.
Everybody's doing their part in this war.
I wanna help.
I'm gonna go back to that recruitment office and tell them that a little case of flat feet isn't going to stop Eric Matthews from fighting those evil Canadians.
I have a feeling it's not the flat feet.
Hi, everyone.
Cory, did you hear the news?
Glenn Miller and his big band orchestra are coming to town.
What do you say we go?
Jeepers, why you guys looking at me all funny?
Cory, you didn't tell Topanga?
Tell me what?
Topanga, I enlisted.
I'm going to war.
But you said you couldn't be without me.
We were going to be together forever.
Topanga, there's some things you just gotta do.
Operator?
Yes.
Connect me to Miss Topanga Lawrence at Zenith-6-5000.
No answer, huh?
Golly.
You can drive from Philly to Cleveland in a week, but they don't have a machine that can take a message.
Don't worry, Cory.
That dame loves you up to the sky and back.
She wouldn't let you ship out without saying goodbye.
Yeah.
Well, I ain't just saying goodbye.
Don't say "ain't.
" Your mother will faint.
Just because you're in the Army doesn't mean you have to talk like a sailor.
Yeah.
Sure, I could've shipped out with the other joes, but the fact is I'm on a secret mission here.
I'm guarding the Philadelphia Bell.
You mean the Liberty Bell?
I've said too much already.
Okay, it's the Liberty Bell.
It's the Liberty Bell.
Rats.
Eric, I just heard about the mental thing.
You mean my flat feet?
Yeah.
That's it.
The flat feet.
Wish I was going with you, Jack, fighting the good fight.
You would have made a great soldier.
I would have loved to have had you by my side.
You still can, pal.
Here.
It's a picture of me.
I want you to bring it with you, put it in the foxhole over your bed.
People will talk.
I know.
That's a great picture of me.
Before you ship out, I want to wish our boys courage, perseverance and a safe trip home.
And during the lull in the fighting, I'd like a thousand-word essay on "what I did during my summer in Europe.
" And, boys, remember, "please" and "thank you.
" Just because you're at war doesn't mean you can't be polite.
I give the orders now, Amy.
All right, everybody!
Let's load the buses and head to Europe!
Please!
Thank you!
Well, come on, Cor.
We gotta hit the road.
Topanga's not here yet.
Maybe she doesn't love me the way I thought.
Of course I love you, you big lug.
I wouldn't let you leave without a proper goodbye.
Listen, I'm not just saying goodbye.
There's something I need to ask you.
Name it, cupcake.
I know we're young, but we still love each other.
Now, these are crazy times.
Who knows what's gonna happen?
Cory, what are you trying to say?
Marry me, Topanga.
You want me to be Mrs. Cory Matthews?
More than anything in the world.
Stay off of the bus!
All right!
Stop tickling!
Let's go, soldier.
We're pulling out.
Topanga, I need an answer.
Yes, Cory, I'll marry you.
I'll be right here waiting for you, and when you return, we'll have the rest of our lives together.
They came from all They have optimism in their hearts and only one thing on their minds.
He's just my roommate, okay?
All right, you dog faces.
Brooklyn, distribute the K-rations.
One can per person and no belly-aching.
Cory, your mom sent you a Waldorf salad, dressing on the side.
I have a little trouble keeping the K-rations down.
So, Cory Any word from Topanga?
Not yet, and every day that goes by that I don't hear from her, I miss her that much more.
This man's hurting!
Any of you other mugs got a hard-luck story of a loved one left behind?
He's just my roommate.
You know what, Shawn, I can't expect the mail to be on time with a war on, right?
Mail call!
Anything for Cory Matthews?
Maybe.
Looks like this girl Topanga's got it bad for you.
You read my mail?
Something's gotta get me through this war.
Give me that.
My dearest Cory, I can only count the days until you return.
Every night I dream about the future.
A house in the country, children playing in the yard, someone to grow old with Hey, pipe down, will you?
We got letters, too.
Sorry.
Please come home soon.
Love, Topanga.
Incoming!
Man your battle stations.
It looks like we've got a war on our hands.
Cory, keep your head down.
You don't want to make Topanga a widow before you even marry her.
Shawn, listen to me.
I made Topanga a lot of promises, okay?
Now, if I don't come back and you do, I need you to do something for me.
Sure, pal.
Anything.
Marry her.
Wait a minute.
She's your sweetheart.
Cory, I wouldn't feel right about that.
Kissing her would be like kissing you.
Hey, you.
I said nothing about kissing.
I just want you to marry the gal.
Topanga's a real peach, she deserves everything she's ever dreamed of.
Okay.
I'll marry her.
Amy.
You're riveting.
Well, thank you.
No, no.
I mean you're riveting.
Well, I decided to join the war effort.
Well, why aren't you down at the airplane factory with Rosie and the other ladies?
Those lazy so-and-sos.
They ought to be ashamed.
The second the whistle blows, off they go to feed their kids.
Oh, George, I miss Cory and Alan.
Well, I'm sure you must get some comfort from Eric.
Well, the Liberty Bell is safe for another day.
The enemy managed to put a crack in it while my back was turned, but I spackled that puppy right back up.
Sabrina, pick up!
Come on.
I know you're there.
Pick up!
It's a boy.
Okay, it's a cat.
I'm stuck in the '40s and I'm dying here.
They haven't invented kitty litter yet.
You really miss her, don't you?
You don't play the harmonica when you're happy.
Well, this war's gonna be over soon, Cory.
You'll be back in the arms of your sweetheart before you know it.
Hey, Shawn.
Feast your eyes on this.
Wow!
That's some fancy ring.
Where'd you get it?
Cracker Jack box.
You know something?
I can hardly wait to slip this little number on her finger.
If ever two people belong together, it's you and Topanga.
Okay, but don't you forget your promise to me.
I know.
I know.
We'll get hitched.
Thanks.
Big news!
Turn on the radio.
Hurry.
Once again, the war in Europe is over.
Yes!
Yes!
Topanga, you hear that?
I'm coming home!
Last one back to Philly is a rotten egg!
Wait!
Cory, you forgot your ring!
The cease-fire will commence in 24 hours.
Wait!
Cory!
Come back!
Cory!
While many celebrate victory for the Allies, for others, the transition to peace is more difficult as time marches on.
Amy, I'm begging you.
The war's over.
There ain't nothing left to rivet.
Did you rivet the door again, darling?
Alan, if I stop riveting, it means the war really is over and Cory's not coming home.
Jack, you defended our country.
You brought back a medal.
I'm proud of the work your boys did over there.
And the boys in Europe are really proud of the work you did defending the bell.
Hug, soldier?
No.
Any word, Mrs. Matthews?
I'm all busted up inside.
Any minute now, I just know he'll be walking through that door.
He won't be able to open it, Amy.
Well, I guess I've put this off long enough.
Topanga, I need to ask you something.
What's on your mind?
Will you marry me?
I probably should have mentioned it was Cory's last wish.
Oh.
If it's what Cory wanted.
He couldn't wait to put this ring on your finger.
It's swell.
If you blow into it, it makes a siren sound.
You're not happy.
You're not Cory.
Well, I guess we should make plans.
Hey, if I had things my way, Cory would walk in the day after the honeymoon and have the whole thing annulled.
Eric, Cory is Topanga's one true love.
I just know my son is out there waiting for someone to rescue him.
If you want to be a hero, you go to Europe and find him and bring him home.
More kisses, my darling Pierre.
Oh, what the heck?
Why not one more?
But now you must get back to your painting.
Who cares about work when you're French and in love?
But the doctor says the painting might help restore your memory.
The canvas tells me nothing.
All I remember is waking up naked, my clothes burned to a crisp, and I was speaking perfect French.
You really think you were speaking perfect French?
Well, nobody's perfect.
Lighten up, Versailles.
My shorts were on fire.
Well, you do remember something.
And what about this portrait you started?
Yes.
The girl A phantom from a dream.
You know, Versailles, every night I wake up in a cold sweat, seeing her face, hearing her voice.
Maybe she's your one true love.
Mr. and Mrs. Matthews, any word yet?
No.
We have to face it.
Cory is No.
I know my son is still alive, and he loves this girl.
There.
I said it.
It's time.
Six months ago, we were allies.
Suddenly all the French have attitudes.
What exactly is an ugly American?
No idea.
Hey, lady, come on, the regular!
Chop-chop.
Let's go.
Eric, we're here to find Cory.
You know something?
You're right.
Lady!
Come on.
Back it up.
Have you seen this fellow?
Oh.
He looks familiar.
No.
We don't get many ghosts in here.
Eric, you've been showing everyone a picture of Cory in his Halloween costume?
Yeah.
It's pretty scary, huh?
I should just take a picture of that guy.
He looks a lot like Cory.
Eric, look closer.
You're alive!
My Cory!
Hey!
Hey!
I don't know any Cory.
I am Pierre, the tortured, French-speaking artist.
No.
No, no, no.
You're Cory Matthews, my kid brother from the US of A whose girlfriend's getting hitched.
We've gotta get you home before she does.
Versailles, tell these American tourists who I am!
Pierre, I knew this day would come.
I'm sorry.
I only speak French.
Pierre, if this is the way for you to find peace, you must go.
No!
No, Versailles.
The way for me to find peace is to put an end to all the dreams that haunt me.
Versailles, make me the happiest tortured Frenchman in all of Paris.
Marry me.
Well, Shawn marrying Topanga.
This is weird.
On the other hand, who would have thought, as principal, that I could perform marriages.
Wait.
I object.
Mrs. Matthews, I can't do this.
Cory's alive.
I can feel it.
When you love somebody, you just know.
That's why I sent Eric.
Mom, think about what you just said.
As brother of the groom, I'm pretty sure I'm ordained to perform the wedding ceremony.
This is what you want, yes, Pierre?
Yes, of course.
A house in the country, kids playing in the field, someone to grow old with.
What's wrong with you, Pierre?
Nothing.
Nothing.
Of course it's what I want.
I want to spend the rest of my life with you.
Is that what you want?
Topanga!
Topanga!
Look, Mom, I'm performing a wedding ceremony.
Eric, go home.
I recognize this girl.
She's the one from your painting.
Perhaps But I don't remember.
Maybe you'll remember this.
It seems familiar.
Versailles, what do you got?
Cory Matthews, if you think for one minute that I'm going to stand here Topanga!
Where am I?
The last thing I remember, I was climbing out of a foxhole to see you, and then, oh, my gosh, I'm in heaven.
Cory, you're alive.
You just lost your memory.
Yeah, but what about Shawn?
What about the promise?
Cory, I could never be with anybody else.
All those things I'd ever dreamed about, a house in the country, kids playing in the yard, they mean nothing to me unless they're with you.
Me, too.
Well, I told you I'd come back.
I found you, you big lug.
So, Cory, now that the war is over, what are you gonna do about Topanga?
I'm gonna pop the question all over again.
You got moxie, kid.
She's gotta know that I really do care about her.
And I'm not just asking because of some crazy war.
Topanga?
There's something I really need to ask you.
Cory, you were going to ask me something?
I found this really cool siren ring in my Cracker Jack box.
Would you like it?
Thanks.
I'll treasure it forever, you big lug.
Everyone finds love and romance in Paris except me.
I got to go somewhere where the people are real and down-to-earth.
LA, here I come.
What a flight!
Five and a half hours behind a screaming kid.
Somebody ought to put him in a cage and stick him down below.
Hey, are you famous?
Do people tell you you look like Tim Allen?
Because you do.
Where do I find Drew Carey?
I wanna have lunch with him.
He seems like a fun guy.
You gotta love LA.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Shawn and Angela are so cute together.
Maybe next weekend, the four of us could go out "The four of us.
" What?
Shawn's two-week rule.
So I guess that's it.
It's over.
Two weeks.
You knew that going in.
I did.
Wait.
Where are you going?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought you were done letting me down easy.
Go ahead.
Never mind.
Are you okay?
You're just taking this so well.
It was a great two weeks.
We had fun.
Yeah.
We did.
So?
So See ya?
That Angela's all right.
I'm gonna miss her.
Well, then why did you break up with her?
As they say south of the border, dos semanas.
Shawn, you guys were really getting along!
You know, your two-week rule is dumb.
No, no, no.
His one-week rule was dumb.
His two-week rule shows growth.
Shawn, just face it.
You're afraid to make a commitment.
I'm not afraid to make a I've been with Cory for 15 years.
Ah, they've been good years.
You worked very hard at it.
Hey, it takes two.
Stop!
You're afraid to get to know someone.
You're afraid of letting someone get to know you.
And unless you get over this, you're going to go through life all alone.
Except for Cory, who will bring you magazines and pudding.
There.
I think I got through to him.
Sure, you did, honey, and now he wants to hear what she has to say.
What did Topanga mean about me being afraid to commit?
You know, most relationships don't work out, and I just want to get out before anyone gets hurt, okay?
Shawn, we just want you to be happy.
Mmm-hmm.
Hey, look.
Somebody left their purse.
Hmm.
Hey, Mr. Feeny, we found this purse.
Who runs the lost and found?
I do, Mr. Matthews.
I teach English, history and film, and I run the lost and found.
We'll put up a notice.
Would you?
Maybe you should go through it and see if there's any ID.
No.
Not gonna.
I once went through my mom's purse.
Yeah.
I can't look at her anymore.
Okay.
Stand back.
I'm going in.
Okay.
No wallet.
No ID.
Well, there's got to be something in there that lets us know who she is, right?
Lip gloss.
She cares about her lips.
Hmm.
Kiwi mango.
No way!
Kiwi That is so sexy!
Do you know that the Ted Koppel show called that "the lip gloss of forbidden love"?
And look at this, a book of sonnets.
Shakespeare, I hear he's good.
Notice the bookmark.
A ticket stub to a Van Damme movie.
Only the greatest actor ever made.
Okay, so what we got here is a purse-losing, lips-protecting, poetry-reading, Van Damme-loving gal.
Wow.
I'd give her two weeks.
Mr. Feeny!
What is it, Mr. Matthews?
Crisis at college.
I have a really big test, okay?
And test scores are important in college.
It turns out they base all the grades on them.
So let's get cracking, okay?
Eric, it's time you did this on your own.
Now, you're fine.
You have all the skills.
Hey You're tutoring another student in there, aren't you?
I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about.
It's Kevin McDougal, isn't it?
The kid from the other side.
Eric, you have the ability to do fine.
Now, just study the materials.
I have confidence in you.
I just wish you had confidence in yourself.
Good luck, my boy.
He's a professional tutor!
You mean nothing to him!
All right.
Here's an easy one.
The Louisiana Purchase?
I don't know!
Stop hounding me!
Come on, man!
Two guys?
1800s?
Lewis and Lewis.
The Lewis twins.
Oh, man, who am I kidding?
I don't belong in college.
Look, just hit the books a little harder.
I'll be back, and we'll try it again, okay?
All right.
Come on, Eric, you can do this.
Just relax and focus.
Columbus.
Cortes.
Marco Come on.
Marco I can't believe this!
Marco Polo.
Marco Polo.
Mr. Feeny, what are you doing here?
I'm here to help you.
Who are you talking to?
Oh, Jack, right.
You remember my mentor, Mr. Feeny.
Yes, I do.
Who are you talking to?
Uh, Mr. Feeny.
The British guy on our couch right there.
I'm from Boston, you boob.
Uh, excuse me.
A little respect.
You're a guest in my house.
Excuse me.
I pay rent here.
I'm talking to Mr. Feeny.
Oh.
Your mentor.
Yeah.
On the couch.
Mr The guy!
Right there!
On our couch!
Eating our beer nuts!
Mmm, nutty.
Okay, I'm leaving.
Man, did I pick a rudie for a roommate.
He acts like you don't even exist.
He can't see me.
Only you can see me.
And only you can see me because I exist only in your imagination.
Okay.
So why are you here?
To take you to the library.
You need to study, and I'm here to help you.
That makes sense.
Can you just hang on one second?
Jack?
Yeah.
Hey, buddy, quick question.
Uh, Feeny or no Feeny?
No Feeny.
Thank you.
You ready?
I'm driving.
Come on.
Hey.
Anyone call about that purse yet?
"Love is not love "Which alters when it alteration finds "Or bends with the remover to remove" No one called, huh?
Bummer.
Anyway, listen.
Topanga and I were talking about your problem.
I don't have a problem.
We feel that if you met the right girl Wait, wait, wait.
Is this you or Topanga talking?
She decided we're one person.
Anyway, Topanga's got this friend.
Debra.
No.
No, no, no.
I don't want to be fixed up.
Hey, you know what else I found in this purse?
A guitar pick, a Greenpeace sticker and a box of Sno-Caps, only the greatest movie snack ever made.
Wait a minute.
Shawn.
Listen.
Don't you want that feeling?
What feeling?
You know, that feeling you get when you meet someone special.
It's the feeling I get every day when I'm with Topanga.
You know, it's warm and happy and fuzzy.
I can't describe it, but there are bunnies.
Lots of bunnies.
You know, we just want you to have that feeling.
Okay?
So meet Debbie.
Fine.
I'll meet Debbie.
Good.
I wonder if Debbie's anything like this girl.
What girl?
The purse girl.
Did you know that she likes classical music?
Shawn, you hate classical music.
Well, I just never gave it a chance.
This is the part where the violin rocks!
Shawn, Shawn, please don't.
Don't.
Don't do this, okay?
Because your date, Debbie, is under the impression that you don't do this.
Okay.
Hello, ladies.
Hello, hello.
Hi.
And Debbie, how are you?
Hi.
I'm Cory, and this is my best friend, Shawn Hunter.
You're very thin!
Is that bad?
Oh, no!
It's good.
Low impact, high impact, kickboxing, cross training.
What are you doing?
Because whatever it is, it's working.
I eat a lot of burgers.
Good!
Good!
Eat fat to burn fat.
Debbie is an aerobics instructor!
Really!
No!
Excellent, excellent!
Excellent!
This is good!
Why would you think that this girl is for me?
Word around the gym, Shawn Hunter is quite a kisser.
This could work.
They seem right for each other.
I don't know.
Shawn doesn't sweat that much.
I hope she's okay with that.
Why don't we talk first?
Um, what kind of music do you like?
Not this.
You can't work out to this.
I like it.
Debbie, if you close your eyes, you can actually see spring.
Animals awakening from their winter rest, flowers blossoming into full bloom.
Try it.
I just see fat people bouncing.
I think there's a relationship happening here.
Let us go to our new couple friends and make plans for weekends at the cottage.
"Love is not love "Which alters when it alteration finds "Or bends with the remover to remove" Why are you doing this to me?
Hi!
How's the happy couple doing?
I need chocolate.
That's 14 grams of fat.
And you have a purse.
Yes, I do.
Come on, now.
That's not really his purse.
He found that purse.
Oh, well, he found an ugly one.
Hey.
I happen to like this purse.
Topanga, I don't think this is working.
Debbie, give it a chance.
No, no, look.
Um I can't do this, okay?
Shawn.
Don't fix me up.
Shawn.
No.
You know what?
I am perfectly happy with the way things are.
Hey.
Hey.
Listen, sorry about last night.
On paper, Debbie sounded pretty good.
Oh!
Forget about it.
Here, have a Sno-Cap.
Hey, Shawn.
Hey, Angela.
Something's different about you.
What is that, a new shirt?
This old thing?
No.
Stop.
Well, it works for you.
Thanks.
Thanks.
Bye.
Okay, why are you so happy?
Well, I I think I met someone.
Someone special.
Shawn, you just giggled.
Yeah.
I've been doing that a lot.
I have the feeling, Cory.
Do you know the one that you were trying to explain?
Well, I woke up this morning, and it was like rays of sunshine were No, no, no, no.
It was more like fluffy, marshmallow clouds coated in No.
I can't explain it either, but I thought I saw a bunny.
Well, good for you, Shawn.
So who is it?
It's her.
The purse girl.
Shawn, you don't know her.
Cory, I do know this girl.
Look, I know everything about her.
I'm in love.
Well, hey, I hope you find her.
It's like you and Topanga, you know?
A perfect fit.
Yeah, but I didn't fall in love with her luggage.
B!
A B in college is, like, the best you can do!
You did very well, Eric.
Hello.
You know, a lot of people might not appreciate what you do, but I do.
You know, Mr. Matthews, I understand that I'm in your imagination, but this ascot I think we can do better.
I'll do anything you want.
Another thing, you've got me in briefs.
I'm a boxer man.
You want me to change your underwear?
Hey, buddy!
I'm waving a B in history!
You're kidding me.
How did you get a B?
Feeny.
Thanks.
Oh, right, your invisible mentor guy.
Come on, man, if you've got a secret, let me in on it.
It's no secret.
It's Feeny.
I believed in him, he helped me.
I got a good grade.
Mr. Feeny?
Mr. Feeny, are you here, sir?
It's, uh It's me, Jack, Eric's friend.
Look, I know you're not my mentor, but I just got beat by Eric on a test.
That's just plain wrong.
So if you could, sir, begin.
I'm ready to learn.
Jack.
He's not there.
He's not?
No.
He's on the balcony.
Oh, Shawnie, I'm glad you're here.
Listen.
Um Based on the information we've gathered from the contents of the purse, I've put together a composite drawing of the woman you love.
Huh?
Okay.
Okay, she's gorgeous, but she's sad.
Sad because she lost her purse.
She She called.
She saw the notice and called.
That's great!
Who is it?
Who is it?
I don't know.
Jack took the message.
I'm supposed to meet her at Chubbie's.
Well, why don't you take this with you to make sure it's her?
I'm not going.
You go.
I don't understand.
Cory, I can't meet her.
This feeling is so incredible, I just want to hold on to it for as long as possible.
I know, but do you understand that when you meet her, that feeling will only get better?
And what if it doesn't?
And what if it's not as good as what I have now?
With the purse?
Just drop it, Cory.
Listen, what are you so afraid of?
I'm afraid of getting hurt, okay?
I mean, I've seen the pain on my father's face every time a woman walks out because he's not good enough.
Shawn.
You are not your father, okay?
And this thing is not real!
Hi, guys.
Oh, hey.
This is real.
All right?
I smile at her, she smiles back.
She's there for me.
Through the good and the bad.
Yeah, well, where I've come from, I've never seen love work.
But it can.
Okay?
This girl here could be your love, your destiny.
That was beautiful, Cory.
What is that, kiwi mango?
It's very sexy.
Whitman.
Major work, Leaves of Grass.
Poe.
Major work, The Raven.
"Quoth the raven " "'Nevermore.
'" Mr. Feeny.
Aren't you a little overdressed for the library?
Oh, not for the one in Laughlin, Nevada.
Ooh, Laughlin, Nevada.
Population, 8,900.
Major business, legalized gambling.
Birthplace of the $2.99 prime rib special.
Wait, why are we going to Laughlin?
We're not going.
I'm going.
Wait a second, Mr. Feeny, I can't do this without you.
Eric, you did this all on your own.
You've always had the skills.
Just keep using them, and you'll never be without me.
That's what you The real Mr. Feeny would say.
Smart man, that Feeny.
Oh, look.
A rare bird.
Huh?
Marco Marco Polo, Mr. Matthews.
Hey!
Don't ever talk to me about love or destiny again.
What happened?
I went there, okay?
I put my heart on the line.
She's got a boyfriend, Cory, and do you know what I feel now?
Pain.
It's like my heart's been ripped out and stepped on!
So just do me a favor and stay out of my personal life, okay?
Shawn, I'm sorry.
I mean it!
I will.
I mean it.
You are so lucky that someone found your purse.
I know, I thought it was gone forever.
Well, here's all your stuff back.
Great.
Wait a minute.
Angela's stuff was in your purse?
Yeah.
I lent it to her.
I felt awful when I lost it.
Your stuff was in her purse?
The lip gloss, the Sno-Caps?
Yeah.
And my book of sonnets.
I can't live without these.
Mr. Feeny?
It's me, Jack.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
You need help studying, don't you?
Who, me?
Nah.
Come on in.
Come on in.
Your prayers have been answered.
Come on.
You?
Yeah.
Oh, man!
I was kind of hoping for your, you know, magical, invisible Mr. Feeny mentor guy.
Okay, listen.
First of all, he doesn't exist, okay?
Second of all, he's in Laughlin, Nevada.
Third of all, you've got the skills, my friend.
You just gotta use them.
Okay?
Take a seat.
Come on.
All right.
I'm gonna shoot a question out at you now.
All right?
You ready?
You sure?
It's a tough one.
Poe's major work.
Gonna give you a hint.
"'Nevermore.
'" This is calculus.
Mr. Feeny.
Mr. Feeny!
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Previously on Boy Meets World Hey, look.
Somebody left their purse.
Shakespeare, I hear he's good.
Notice the bookmark.
A ticket stub to a Van Damme movie.
Only the greatest actor ever made.
Okay, so what we got here is a purse-losing, lips-protecting, poetry-reading, Van Damme-loving gal.
Wow.
I'd give her two weeks.
I went there, okay?
I put my heart on the line.
She's got a boyfriend, Cory, and do you know what I feel now?
Pain.
It's like my heart's been ripped out and stepped on!
So just do me a favor and stay out of my personal life, okay?
Give me a "T"!
Give me an "E"!
Give me an "R"!
Shawn Hunter!
See?
I can make a cheer about anything.
And they wouldn't let you on the cheerleading squad.
Do you wanna make out?
So, Angela, the coach says, "Scooter"!
That's what he calls me, Scooter.
"Go in there and save the day.
" Gee, what happened, Scooter?
Well, I saved the day.
You wanna make out?
I got to tell him.
Shawn told you not to interfere in his personal life.
Yeah, but, Topanga, this is the woman of his dreams, okay?
The woman he could spend the rest of his life with.
I don't consider that personal.
Shawn, Shawn, let the nice lady breathe.
I need to talk to you about Angela.
This better be important.
Well, do you consider the purse girl important?
Yes.
Listen.
Everything that was in that purse, okay?
The book of poetry, the Vivaldi, the Van Damme ticket stub, it was all her.
Who?
Angela.
All that stuff belongs to Angela.
The purse belonged to Beth.
No, Angela borrowed Beth's purse.
But that's none of our business now, is it, Cory?
No, it's not our business at all.
What are you going to do about it, mister?
Nothing.
Angela and I went out for two weeks.
If I was in love with her, you don't think I'd know it?
Shawn, listen.
Angela's everything you've ever wanted in a girl, okay?
But you don't know it because you haven't looked into her eyes yet.
Look into her eyes.
Hey, Shawn.
Hey.
Is this Is this a book of sonnets?
Yes.
Why are you giggling?
Am I?
What's the matter with you?
Look into her eyes.
Shawn, why are you looking at me like that?
Because I never have before.
I It's Angela.
Cory!
Hey, Shawnie's in love.
You call her?
No.
I'm way too nervous.
I wouldn't know where to start.
Well, how about starting by saying hello?
That's too risky, Cory.
It would probably come out, "I want to have your children.
" I can't believe this is Shawn Hunter, man of a thousand dates, and he's afraid to call a girl.
How dare you?
My family comes from Cossacks.
I fear nothing!
Good.
Here she comes.
Hi, Angela.
Hi, Cory.
Uh, Shawn's in the closet.
Hey, Shawn.
Angela!
You smell nice.
Hey, Topanga.
Hey, Angela.
Hey, Cory, these balloons just arrived from Balloon-atics.
It says, "Happy anniversary.
Love, Norman.
" I'm pretty sure I said Cory.
And I also made us reservations at Barelli's.
Wasn't it our anniversary last month?
No, no, no, we were just doubling with my parents.
It was their anniversary.
Okay, wait, so, when's ours?
It's Wednesday.
How come Janitor Bud knows our anniversary?
Oh, no, no, that's Shawn.
He's hiding from Angela.
Oh, that is so sweet.
It's like everything I have ever known about girls has been completely erased from my brain.
Hello, sir.
See?
I know that was wrong.
Shawn, listen, you got to pull yourself together.
All my life, I have never worried about whether a girl likes me or not.
But with Angela, it matters.
I really want her to like me.
That is so cute.
Personally, I worship the man.
It's a little sad.
Well, here she comes again.
Why don't you talk to her?
I can't!
I don't think so.
Hey, Shawn.
Hi.
Do you want to go out and get something to eat later?
I'd like that.
I saw this and I thought of you.
See ya.
What'd she give you?
It's a little seashell.
Do you like seashells?
I like this one.
Yes, Mother, I completely understand.
Have fun on your cruise.
Love to Dad.
Bye.
Eric, looks like I'm going to be alone for Thanksgiving.
Yeah, it's kind of sad.
Maybe I could join you and your family for Thanksgiving.
No.
Well, it's just, you know, I don't know if they want to chance inviting anybody else over after last year.
We had Feeny over.
He ate all the white meat.
I guess I'll just stay here and order a pizza or something.
That's great.
So you're covered.
Eric!
I'm kidding.
I love needling you.
Jackie, what if we have Thanksgiving here?
Eric, it's us.
We could ruin Thanksgiving for a lot of people.
Man!
Am I glad you weren't at Plymouth Rock.
"Ooh, I'm hungry.
Let's go back to Sweden.
" My gosh!
Is that Yes.
My black book.
Early '90s edition.
Wow.
May I look?
No, no, no.
There are some names in here that may upset you and your parents.
Shawn, that's the old you, though.
I mean, there's a girl out there who likes you, who asked you out.
I know, but I started thinking that if I got into a relationship, I'd be giving up all this.
It's not what you're giving up, it's what you're gaining.
No offense, Cory, but you have no idea what I'd be giving up.
You know, if you can find one girl in there that you actually care about, then call her.
"A," Angela.
She's the first name in my book.
She's the one I want.
But a real relationship?
That is so new to me.
Do you remember that airplane movie where the nun had to fly the plane and the air traffic controller had to talk her down?
I'm going to be your air traffic controller.
So that means all I have to do is Yes.
Be the nun.
Come on, you big chunk of ice, be a turkey!
Be a big turkey.
Gobble, gobble, block of ice!
It's three days till Thanksgiving.
Aren't you afraid it might melt?
That's why I'm making it bigger.
All right, my pumpkin pies are ready.
Ahhh!
Here, try this, man.
Mmm!
Look at that.
It looks terrific.
Let me try this here.
So?
Is pumpkin pie supposed to have bones?
That's it.
I'm calling the caterers.
Your parents are expecting some traditional feast.
My parents?
Come on.
Thanksgiving's like the least important day of the year to them.
They don't even exchange gifts.
Hi, Jack.
Eric.
Hey.
Hey, I know you guys are busy, so I'm going to get right to this.
Thanksgiving is the most important day of the year to me.
I'm sure Eric told you that.
No, no, he didn't.
Yeah, I did, Dad.
He hears what he wants to hear.
Thirty years ago, I sat down to Thanksgiving dinner with my Grandpa Charlie.
We feasted on turkey, stuffing, cranberries, yams and pie.
Then we sat down.
I watched my first football game on TV, sitting on my grandpa's knee.
He gave me this watch.
And then he went upstairs to take a little nap and died in his sleep.
Daddy, I miss Grandpa Charlie.
Three days till turkey.
You make better pies.
Vivaldi's Four Seasons.
I love that.
So do I. It's so beautiful.
If you close your eyes, you can actually see the seasons change.
I said that.
I said the exact same thing.
You know, I really like hanging out with you.
Maybe we could see a movie later on this week.
I hear there's a new Van Damme movie opening.
I love Van Damme.
I know.
So, how about Friday night?
Oh.
I have plans with Ted that night.
You're still going out with Ted?
Yeah.
Oh.
I'd better go check on our food.
She's still going out with Ted.
Yeah, I know.
He's a two-weeker, okay?
He means nothing.
Just a name in her book.
Tell her how you feel, okay?
Speak from your heart.
Are you sure?
Hey, who's flying the plane?
Cory is.
Well, here we go.
Great.
Can I ask you something?
You can ask me anything.
What do you think of Cory and Topanga?
I think they're a great couple.
Maybe we can have what they have.
Shawn, we're not even dating.
What do you call what we're doing right now?
You asked me out on a date, right?
I asked you to go get something to eat.
You gave me a seashell.
Sometimes a seashell is just a seashell.
Look, Angela, I want to be with you more than anybody in this entire world.
Why can't we be Cory and Topanga?
I'm sorry.
I got to go.
Stupid!
Stupid!
Stupid!
Shawn!
Cory, you should have seen it.
Crash and burn.
Nuns should never fly airplanes.
I'm just going to go back to the way things were.
No.
No, you don't, okay?
You can't go back to this.
This will never make you happy.
My aunt!
Look, I gave it a shot, okay?
I opened myself up and I got hurt.
Obviously Angela doesn't want what I want.
No, she doesn't know what she wants, okay?
I know what she wants.
Here, I want to tell you a story.
Now, 13 years ago, Shawn, I was in the sandbox with Topanga, and then she started going after Joey Hutchinson.
I don't have to tell you how that made me feel.
You were four.
Well, you don't have to be five to have feelings.
Anyway, I could have given up, right?
I mean, the sandbox was filled with pretty babies, but I didn't give up.
So I told Joey that he could fly, and I pointed to the monkey bars.
And for that brief moment that Joey was airborne, I told Topanga she had beautiful lips and I kissed her.
Wait a minute.
When you were four, you told Topanga she had beautiful lips?
And a very cute tush.
I want what you have.
Then go get it.
Angela, hear me out.
It will just take a minute.
You don't mind, do you?
You want a fry?
Look, I read the same books as you, I listen to the same music, and I go to the same movies.
So when I tell you how I feel, it is not just words.
Hunter, I'm on a date here.
Come on.
Why are you doing this?
We went out.
You told me it was only going to be for two weeks and then it was going to be over.
I know that you're scared, okay?
I'm scared, too.
We both love Vivaldi, and we're both scared.
I'm scared, too.
Shawn, you've never been in a relationship for longer than two weeks and neither have I. We wouldn't know what to do.
You know what?
This is getting too heavy for me, so I'm taking my fries and I'm leaving.
Ted!
I paid for these fries.
Give me a chance.
I just want to see you.
Well, Dad, it's another anniversary night for me and Topanga.
What says "I love you" more, a fern or a ficus?
Cory, how long have you and Topanga been together?
Why?
Well, sometimes it seems like you've been together longer than me and your mom.
Isn't it great?
Cory, I told her this was a very casual evening.
Yeah, well, that's my casual suit.
Why is he wearing your suit?
Well, Dad, because tonight romance and love fill the air.
You're 90!
All right, now, listen, you and Angela have 8:00 reservations at Barelli's.
Barelli's?
I don't really see Angela and me in a place like that.
Shawn, you said you want to be like me and Topanga.
Well, me and Topanga go to Barelli's because Barelli's is the place where dreams come true.
I mean, it says so on the menu.
Shawn, this is really fancy.
You think this is fancy?
I don't think it's that fancy.
Topanga, why are you angry with me?
I mean, was it the fern?
Because for the extra $2, I'll happily change it for the ficus.
Cory, it wasn't the fern.
This isn't about the fern!
Okay, then, what's it about?
Look, let's just try to get through the evening, okay?
Signor Cory.
Signora Topanga.
How many years you been married now, huh?
The kids, they good, no?
We are not married and we do not have kids.
Eduardo, she's a little angry at me.
Here's a fiver.
Why don't you put an extra shrimp on her cocktail?
Si.
Come.
Okay.
Shawn and Angela!
What a surprise, huh?
Hi, guys.
Talk about coincidences.
Of all the restaurants in the town.
Yeah, and all the suits.
Enjoy.
I have come to take your order.
You no touch the pate.
It's not good?
I really don't know what it is.
It's Come si dice?
Goose liver.
You requested it when you telephoned this afternoon.
When I called, did I sound like I had curly hair and was 90?
Cory?
You're looking at them more than you're looking at me.
Ah, look at those two.
I mean, it's us 20 years ago.
Cory, what's happening to us?
What What do you mean, what's happening to us?
We're out celebrating another one of our delightful occasions.
Who talks like that?
Shawn, you said you knew me.
If you really knew me, why would you bring me here?
Because I have no idea what I'm doing.
I don't know how to be myself around you.
I really want you to like me, Angela.
I do like you.
If I didn't, I wouldn't be here.
So, then why is this so hard?
I've never had a serious relationship either.
Every time I got close to someone, I just figured it was best to get away before we hurt each other.
Is someone going to get hurt here, Shawn?
No.
No, not if we're ourselves.
Hey, Eduardo.
Could you get rid of this and just bring us a couple of burgers?
You no like?
No.
We like burgers.
Barelli's is a place where all your dreams come true.
Two burgers!
Fries.
Oh, yeah, and get some ketchup, too.
Hmm!
Do you mind if I take this tie off?
Oh, please, never wear a tie again, okay?
Why do you have that thing anyway?
It can't be yours.
Well, you know, I'm not one to give up any names, but Cory.
All of this was Cory.
He's a good guy.
He just wants us to have what he and Topanga have.
That's it!
That's it!
I have had it!
I don't want to put the Sweet'N Low in my purse!
You're going to get us in trouble in our place.
I don't want this to be our place.
You're ruining our anniversary.
What anniversary is this anyway?
Is this the first time we kissed?
The first time we went out?
The first time we met?
What?
What is it?
It's the anniversary of the first time we ate at Barelli's.
How could you forget?
Because I hate Barelli's.
I am 50 years away from going to Barelli's.
Can't we just go downtown and grab a pretzel from a cart?
Fine.
I'm not making you happy?
Go!
You think you're going to find somebody else at your age?
Signora Topanga, I must request that you keep your voice down.
Thank you so much.
This is what scares me.
You get close to someone, and you end up hating each other.
Angela, there's nothing to be scared of.
When two people are truly, truly in love, there's no way they can end up hating each other.
Cory, look at us!
I am yelling at you, and you're not even getting mad at me.
You call that a growl?
That was pathetic.
Well, I could never really get mad at you.
Cory, I just don't want to celebrate any more occasions.
I was just doing it 'cause I thought that's what you wanted.
No.
I just want to be 17.
Me too.
Shawn?
Angela?
I want what they have.
It's Thanksgiving and all we have is an Easter basket and Santa Claus.
My dad's going to kill you.
I told you we'd ruin Thanksgiving for everybody.
It's all right.
I got it.
I spend a few nights in the hospital, they'll forget about the whole thing.
Hit me.
What?
Hit me.
Bust me in the nose.
Crack a rib.
Come on.
Eric, that's a stupid idea.
You know something, you're right.
I'll hit you.
What the Come on, come on.
Face or gut?
Just a second.
I am sorry, buddy.
Come in!
Hey!
Look, Jack, they found our turkey.
Did you two actually believe that we thought you could pull this off, huh?
You guys can't make toast.
Eric, do you at least have some clean dishes?
No.
I'll carve the bird.
Now, everybody wants dark meat, right?
No!
Cory, this is so nice, us all being together on Thanksgiving.
You know, I want to tell you something.
I'm so glad I'm here, Shawn.
Um, before we sit down, I'd like to say thanks for all the good things that have happened to us.
And to me.
Happy Thanksgiving, everyone.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
You know, that is exactly the type of behavior that is gonna get you fired from the work-study program.
Nobody gets fired from the work-study program.
Let's try and have a good time.
They're not paying us to have a good time.
Cory, they're not paying us at all, which is exactly why the CEO of this company is going to get a photocopy of my butt.
They're paying us in experience.
Working in the mailroom?
You know, a lot of people in this company started in the mailroom.
I began right where you're standing 43 years ago.
You see that?
And where do you work now?
Right where you're standing.
Move.
Forty-three years with the same company.
Wow.
You must really love advertising.
Advertising?
Is that what they do here?
I like this guy.
He reminds me of me, but more mature.
You know, Shawn, if it's a role model you're looking for, there's someone else in this very room that you could look to.
Well, I don't see anyone except you.
Yes, me.
This corporate world is my very essence.
Okay?
And as I climb the ladder to success, I want you there right with me.
Next to you?
Behind me.
That's how ladders work.
So, Shawn, listen and learn.
Is that where you want to be, upstairs with the big fellas?
Oh, yes, very much.
Bon voyage.
Hey.
How are you?
Hey.
Good to see you.
Ooh, nice-looking family.
You've lost weight.
Shawn, what are you doing?
You never make eye contact with senior management.
You have to know your place.
Observe.
Hi.
How you doing?
Nice loafers.
See?
Shawn, what are you doing?
Hey, I may not know much about business, but I do know that when a phone rings, you answer it.
Hello.
Keller-Marsden.
Uh, no, I don't see him.
Can I help you?
Shawn, hang up the phone.
Hang up.
What are you yelling for?
Oh, my God, there's yelling.
Yell back.
If you were supposed to have it today and it's not there, don't you think that we have a very good reason?
Mr. Becker, we weren't going to send those ads out until they were perfect.
Uh-huh.
You'll have them Monday.
No, no.
Thank you, Mr. Becker.
Cor Who are you?
His name is George Feeny.
Shawn Hunter.
Work-study program.
Who are you?
Tom Morris.
Vice President, Keller-Marsden Advertising.
Oh.
You just got a phone call.
I heard.
I like the way you handled Becker.
I did, too.
My temp didn't show up today, and I could use somebody like you.
I work in the mailroom with Cory.
Well, I want you up here with me.
Wow!
How about that, huh?
Two hours on the job, and look who's out of the mailroom.
Mom.
Mom, get a life.
Eric, what are you doing?
I've watched this show for four years now.
I've never missed an episode.
What do you mean, get a life?
I just feel that a woman like you should be out doing something productive.
Oh, yeah?
What do you call raising three children?
Done.
Hatched.
Raised.
Listen, Mom, I'm gonna give you the same pearls of wisdom you once gave me, okay?
There's a whole big world out there.
You go be part of it, young man.
Well, there is one thing I've always wanted to try.
Don't care.
Just go do something.
Thank you, Eric.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
She doesn't love you, Victor.
Hey.
How you doing?
Things are a little crazy, but I'm handling it.
Mr. Morris is still letting you play assistant, huh?
Yeah.
He even gave me a little assignment.
It's a It's a toothpaste account.
And Mr. Morris wants to know what teenagers are looking for.
Easy.
Bacteria.
I just saved your job, pal.
Actually, I was thinking that fresh breath is sexy No, Shawn, no.
Okay?
Sex does not sell.
Focus on the bacteria, on the gingivitis, on teeth falling out.
That's the pitch.
I don't know, Cor.
I've kissed a lot of girls, and I gotta say, I'm a breath man.
Shawn, this is the business world, okay?
I know what I'm talking about.
Shawn, toothpaste!
Let's hear what you got.
Bacteria.
Hey, bud.
Oh, sorry, buddy.
This seat's saved for Monica.
What happened to Bridget?
She found out about Monica.
Oh, excuse me.
Is this seat taken?
Yes, Mom.
Mom?
Eric?
What are you doing here?
Am I in trouble?
I'm in creative writing.
But this is creative writing.
Oh, I had no idea this was your class.
But, well, you said to get out there in the world, so here I am, back in school.
Hey, maybe we could all have lunch together.
Your mom is, like, so cool.
No, she's not.
Look, Mom, when I said get back in the world, I meant, like, the mall.
Eric, I'm in creative writing because I always wanted to write.
And your words really inspired me.
I was hoping you'd be happy for me.
Happy.
I am.
I'm happy.
Yeah.
Who wouldn't be happy going to school with their mom?
Look, at least scoot down one, okay?
The seat's saved for Monica.
Gotcha.
You won't even know I'm here.
Yeah.
Hi.
Oh, you must be Monica.
Eric, she's really pretty.
Hi.
Who are you?
I'm Eric's mother.
Sit up straight, dear.
So then the senator told me that he really liked what I said, and now it's going to be a law.
I know what you mean.
Why, here in the mailroom, I suggested that we start using self-adhesive stamps.
Well, what'd they say?
"Yeah, whatever.
" Cory, you'll work your way out of the mailroom.
Don't bet on it.
Who's that?
My boss.
Where's Shawn?
You know, he's upstairs.
Look, Cory, I hope you're looking out for him.
He really looks up to you.
Isn't she cute?
Like a young Nancy Sinatra.
Hey.
Shawn, you're back in the mailroom.
Listen, they shouldn't have put you in a job you weren't ready for.
Actually, I pitched my sexy breath idea, and Mr. Morris liked it.
He liked it?
Yeah.
I guess you're not the only one with good ideas.
You know, I don't get it, Phil.
All he did was pick up a phone.
Was it ringing?
Yeah.
He's a smart kid.
"And as I turned the corner "and walked down that road, it occurred to me, "either I was going the wrong way, or that semi truck was, "but that's life.
"And it's all we have.
" Thank you.
Thank you, Eric.
Next, we will hear from Amy.
Oh.
Um, "A Young Married Woman, by Amy Matthews.
" Oh, this is great.
A thousand words on dryer lint.
"The wedding was over.
"I was 19 and about to embark on a new life.
"The hotel suite was as lovely as a picture.
"Alan walked toward me, and I began to tremble.
" Oh, my God.
"My lips " Uh, hello.
Tom Morris' office.
Can I help you?
No, he's still in the The bathroom.
Uh, well, sir, we were gonna send it to your office today, but it wasn't good.
Hello?
No, please don't yell.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Who was that?
Uh That was Mr. Davis from Brock Toys.
Well, what did he want?
Well, he said something about moving his account to another agency.
Hey, why don't I do a lunch run, huh?
Falafel?
Shawn, want to get Davis back on the phone?
Uh, Mr. Morris Look, nothing personal, but maybe this isn't the right place for you.
You better pack your things.
I have Mr. Davis on line two.
Sir What am I supposed to do?
Well, not everybody's cut out for the business world.
Cory, I'm I'm sorry.
Oh, Susan Lucci, how do you not win an Emmy?
Well, somebody looks like he just got canned from work-study.
I did.
You're kidding.
No.
Oh, boy.
Well, you know, not every person is right for every job.
Dad, I know, but I was supposed to be the one to succeed, not Shawn.
Everyone knows that.
Well, maybe you ought to give Shawn a little more credit.
I mean, if he's doing well, you should be happy for him.
No, I am happy for him, but what about me?
You know, if I don't succeed in the business world, the future of this country looks very bleak.
Stop putting so much pressure on yourself.
You know you'll do fine.
What are you doing here?
I was just having lunch with Mr. Davis from Brock Toys.
What exactly did you say to him?
I don't want to talk about it, okay?
If you'll excuse me, I was about to take a nap.
Why, I just came by with some news that may cheer you up.
I'm listening.
Well, I talked to Morris, and he agreed to let you come back to the agency.
Really?
Yeah, but you're gonna have to take a drug test.
They think you're a little "wound.
" They want me back.
This has got to be a mistake.
Don't tell me you're not qualified for this job either.
I'm supposed to be an executive, Phil, making important executive decisions.
You will.
Now, here are the deodorizers for the toilet.
You decide how many to put in each one.
I'll give you a hint.
It's less than two.
No, no, I I won't do it.
Okay, listen, the work-study program is supposed to prepare you for life.
Where's the lesson in this?
The lesson is that you do whatever they ask you to do, and you do it as well as you can.
Oh, come on, you're a good kid.
Oh, don't take home the toilet paper.
They check cars.
Cory, what are you doing dressed as a janitor?
I don't know, Shawn.
You tell me.
Well, I thought they gave you your old job back in the mailroom.
No.
This is my job.
You're kidding.
No.
So that's the toothpaste campaign, huh?
Yeah.
Looks like I was wrong.
Sex does sell.
Just a different way to go.
Hey, Shawn, I spilled my coffee.
You want to get the guy to clean up that mess?
I'm the guy.
Hey, bud.
Hi, kids.
Hi, Amy.
Amy?
Her name is not Amy.
Her name is Mrs. Matthews.
So, what are you guys doing?
I had a little trouble with my writing assignment, so Amy offered to help.
By the way, that last paper you wrote, I couldn't stop thinking about it.
That's because it was smut!
"My lips quivered.
" It was filth!
It was squeamy filth!
Eric, the teacher gave Amy an "A".
He's dirty, too.
Well, I think he's really going to like my next paper.
Let me see this.
Let me see this.
"An evening in Cape Cod.
" Now this is more like it.
"As Alan touched me, my lips began to quiver.
" Don't you do anything but quiver?
Oh, my God, you do.
Give me that.
Mom, college is my time.
You shouldn't be here.
You should be at home raising your kids.
They're not done yet.
I've been a mother and a wife for most of my life, and I've loved it.
But I need to be more.
And if you're uncomfortable with that, then you're right, I shouldn't be here.
Mmm.
Mmm!
Mmm?
Oh.
Oh!
Oh, well, okay.
Whoo!
Well, what do you think?
Amy, it's some of the most provocative fiction I have ever read.
It's all true, George.
Oh, dear.
Well, nevertheless, you have a lot of talent.
I mean, as a storyteller.
Well, it doesn't really matter, 'cause I'm dropping the class.
Eric shouldn't have to be embarrassed by having his mother with him.
You can't do that, Amy.
Why are you calling me Amy?
Because that's your human name.
I reread your paper, and I realized that you're more than just a mother and a housewife.
You're also a really good storyteller, and you should You should come back to class.
Really?
Yeah.
And if that's what you want to do, you should come back, and you should really keep writing.
That means so much coming from you.
Mom, your paper was so good, and I was so proud of you, that I sent a copy to Grandma.
Mother?
Oh, dear.
Cory, look, I know it's awkward for you to be doing so much better than Shawn, but this dinner has been planned for a long time, okay?
We just won't talk about work.
Okay.
Hey, you guys.
These are for you.
Let's put them in water.
Hey.
Cory.
Hi.
I'm I'm glad you came.
Why wouldn't I come?
I was invited for dinner, so I'm here for dinner.
Where's my dinner?
Cory's right.
Why don't we eat?
Aren't you going to get that?
No, it's It's just the fax.
They gave you a fax.
Why didn't they give you a fax, Cory?
Well, at my level, they don't fax you.
You just know.
What's that ringing?
Nothing.
A cell phone?
The The company gave it to him.
Good for you, Shawn.
Yeah.
They also gave him a credit card.
Oh, a credit card, too.
Cory, the company gave Shawn a cell phone and a credit card.
What did they give you?
They gave me these.
Cory, they look like janitor's keys.
Yeah, they are.
I'm a janitor, okay?
It's all out in the open now.
I hope you're happy.
Thanks.
Cory, there's nothing wrong with being a janitor.
Cory.
Cory, look, I didn't want any of this to happen, but it did, okay?
I really want to enjoy it.
Shawn, no one's stopping you.
I can't enjoy this because of what it's doing to you.
Because it's killing me!
Okay?
All of my life, you're the one that messes up, I'm the one that cleans up after you.
That's the way it's always been.
I know.
For the first time, I'm doing something on my own.
And it feels good.
It feels really good.
Well, I mean, it's supposed to feel good.
You did great.
I guess for the first time, I'm just jealous of you.
Of me?
Cory, stop putting so much pressure on yourself.
Everyone knows you're going to be fine.
I'm sorry I underestimated you.
I'm real proud of you.
Yeah, well, I'm proud of you, too.
For what?
Well, you know the executive washroom on the 30th floor?
I heard Keller say to Marsden that it's never been cleaner.
That was me.
So, Eric, are you okay with having your mom stay in the class?
Sure.
We had a little discussion, and she promised no more revealing stories about her and Dad.
I'm going to miss those.
Especially the one in the elevator.
Amy, would you like to read us your latest short story?
I'd be glad to.
All right, Mom!
"A Mother's Struggle, by Amy Matthews.
"After 36 hours of screaming and sweating, "my bundle of joy, Eric, "gallantly made his way through the birth canal.
" Hey, hey, hey, hey!
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
You know what I love most about these tortilla chips?
They're free.
We need more chips over here, por favor.
Senorita?
Los waitress.
Stop calling me "waitress.
" I have a name, you know.
Yeah, "Ramona.
" Yes, it's Spanish for Topanga.
Look it up.
And why are you being so rude?
Listen, girls, it's your first day of work, okay?
We're just trying to break you in by doing our little obnoxious customer routine.
Shawn?
This is cubed ice.
I asked for crushed.
Oh, and this is the salsa for your chips.
Thank you.
So, ladies, we thought you might want to celebrate your first day in the work field by taking us out to dinner.
Well, actually, we were thinking of going out with a bunch of people from work.
Yeah, you two should join us.
Well, we'd love to.
Good.
We're going dancing.
No!
Dancing?
Puh!
Yeah.
Puh!
Shawn, we really like dancing.
You should come with us.
It'll be fun.
Cor, maybe I should go dancing, you know?
My relationship with Angela is new.
I don't want to disappoint her.
Hey.
You're a guy.
She's got to get used to it.
Shawn, we are men, okay?
Now if men don't want to dance, we do not dance.
Tonight we do what men do.
Right!
What's that?
We go to the gym!
We pump some iron.
And we sweat.
Are there private showers?
Well, there better be.
So, guys?
Dancing?
Yes?
No?
No, no.
You girls go with your friends from work and do your little dance routine.
Shawn, does that go for you, too?
Are you sure I'm not going to get hurt on this?
It's the way God intended it.
No, go dance.
It's God's will.
So, ladies.
You're coming dancing tonight with myself and my equally handsome and beautiful friend Sergio?
Yes?
Yes.
Boy, we pumped a ton of iron last night.
How you feeling?
Good.
How about you?
Good.
You want to help me take off my jacket?
Yeah.
Listen, what's important is we had a good time doing our guy thing, and the girls got dancing out of their systems.
I just wonder if Nunzio or Sergio tried anything.
I don't trust anyone with that many zippers on their pants.
I'm going to ask.
Never!
And appear to be jealous?
You never ask.
Never.
Under any circumstances.
Hey, guys.
What happened last night?
You see what I did there?
Nothing happened.
We danced.
I am a little tired.
You got a problem.
Boy, that Nunzio sure knows how to move.
Oh, I got a problem, too.
Sergio's no slouch on the dance floor, either.
I didn't ask.
Why, Topanga, I think they're jealous.
I am not jealous, okay?
Did he touch you?
Sergio or Nunzio?
What difference does it make?
Angela, you were out with other guys, dancing and sweating.
And what is with all those zippers?
We asked you to come along.
Yes, and I believe your words were, "Puh"!
Puh-ssibly.
We like to dance.
Our friends from work like to dance.
We did nothing wrong.
What's the big deal?
It's no big deal.
It's no big deal at all.
So, then, you guys will come with us next time?
Hey.
Wouldn't miss it.
We're going dancing with them?
No.
We're going to the gym so we can beat the zippers off of Sergio and Nunzio.
There are the girls.
Okay, remember, if they ask, we are not here because we're jealous of the gorgeous Latin men.
We're here for the el grande burrito for $2.99.
Got it.
Okay.
Let's go.
Hey!
What are you guys doing here?
We're here to beat up Sergio and Nunzio.
Shawn!
But we'd like to start with two el grande burritos, please.
Chicken, beef.
Look, Cory, you can't do this.
This is the busiest night of the week.
Angela?
Sorry we can't talk.
We got tables.
Of all the lame excuses, "We've got tables.
" Welcome to El Coyote.
I'm the manager.
Yeah, I know who you are.
We met the other night, Sergio.
No, I am Nunzio.
Sergio is the one with the big muscles and the handsome smile.
Where?
Over there.
Talking to Angela.
Hey, Sergio!
Hands offio.
Oh, yes.
You are Shawn.
The one who belittles the art of the dance.
We could take you.
And don't tell me.
You are Cory.
The luckiest man alive, for you are dating Topanga, who is as beautiful as a flower.
No, no, no, no.
Not a flower.
A garden.
A garden full of beautiful flowers.
Your words are beautiful.
Gracias.
And because you are special to Topanga and Angela, you are special to Nunzio.
I give you a special table.
And please don't order off the children's menu anymore.
Hey, Topanga, what time did you say you're getting off?
Cory, I'm carrying a sizzling plate of fajitas.
Ow, ow, ow, ow!
What's with her tonight?
Maybe Angela knows what's bothering her.
Angela, honey?
Sorry, I got a table of 12.
You're not fooling anyone.
All right, enough of this.
Topanga!
What?
Topanga!
What?
I'd like a baby burrito, a junior taco, and your boyfriend would also like to know what time his girlfriend's getting home from work.
I told you, I don't know.
I bet Sergio and Nunzio would know.
Stop that!
Look, I need to concentrate on my work right now, and I'm having a hard time doing that with you here.
I'll call you when I have a better idea of what time I'm through.
Topanga, table 5, please.
Got it.
Sure, for Nunzio, she has all the time in the world.
Hey, George?
Check it out.
Satellite TV, Amy must be thrilled.
So that's it?
That's our Saturday night?
You installing that stupid dish?
Oh, honey, look.
Just let me set it up, and the rest of the night is yours, all right?
Yeah, I believe that.
Hey, Dad.
I think you got a bad satellite dish, man.
I don't see anything yet.
Just hold the ladder, all right?
And don't speak!
Hello, Katherine.
George Feeny.
Good evening.
Pleasant evening for a stroll, isn't it?
What are you doing home on a Saturday night?
A handsome man like yourself.
Stop that.
I'm about to sit in front of a fire, enjoy a glass of sherry, and dive into a good book.
Alone?
Yes.
Alone.
Well, I was going to go up the street to Starbucks and have a coffee, also alone.
Well, I hear they make a heck of a mocha.
Good night, Katherine.
Mr. Feeny?
What?
A hotty like Kathy Anderson asks you out, and you just blow her off?
She asked me out?
She was practically throwing herself at you.
When?
"I'm going to Starbucks, also alone.
" I heard that.
She wanted some coffee.
Yeah, with a side of you.
She thinks you're cute.
Wait a minute.
You think she wanted a date?
Ah!
Now you're getting it.
Why didn't I see that?
Well, Mr. Feeny, I'm in college.
You're still in high school.
Eric!
What?
Push, push, push, push!
I can't.
Come on, you wimp.
Now push.
Sergio could.
Nunzio could.
Nunzio!
That's one.
Okay, your turn.
That was a good rep.
You did not give up on it.
Thank you.
Cor, we trust our girls, right?
Of course, we trust them.
That's why I'm going to call Topanga.
She won't get mad?
No, no.
She'll be flattered.
Women love that kind of attention.
Well, when you're done with Topanga, put Angela on.
I want to flatter her, too.
Hola.
This is Nunzio.
Hello, Nunzio.
El Coyote is now closed.
If this is for reservations, please call tomorrow during normal business hours.
If you need to contact me, Topanga, Sergio, or Angela, you can reach us at the Boom Boom Room at 438 Thanks, guys.
Cory, what are you doing here?
No, here's a better question.
What are you doing here?
I live here.
Well, if you live here, why aren't you inside at 12:00 at night?
Well, we worked late, and a bunch of us went out.
I know, Topanga, but you were supposed to call me.
I did call you.
Your mom said you were out for the evening.
So, where did you go, dancing?
Yes, Cory.
I like it, especially after a long night at work.
Okay.
It helps me unwind.
Okay, so Cory's not home.
You just run off with Nunzio to the Boom Boom Room.
How did you know I was at the Boom Boom Room?
I called the restaurant, okay?
It was on the machine.
So you were checking up on me?
No.
No.
I was checking on tomorrow's special.
I mean, the seafood enchilada for $3.50?
How do they do that?
I mean, the shrimp It's so big.
Cory, I don't like this jealous side of you.
Nunzio is just a friend who likes to dance.
I've asked you to take me dancing a million times.
This has nothing to do with that.
I forbid you to see him again.
I'm going to bed.
I forbid you to go to bed.
You know, I don't get women.
Why can't they be more like men?
Yeah, I'll tell you one thing.
There'd be a lot less Emma Thompson movies.
Hi, guys.
Hey, Sonja.
Hey, Cookie.
Looking good.
Go for the burn.
Cor, let's try to figure this thing out.
The girls want to dance more than anything in the world.
And we want to make them happy.
Okay, there's got to be a simple solution to all of this.
Anything?
Nothing.
Wait!
Here it comes.
Okay.
The girls talk about how it's okay to have guys who are just "friends".
Well, what if we got ourselves a couple of girls who are just "friends"?
Cory, that's brilliant.
That's the simple solution.
You know what, Shawn?
I've got a strange craving for Mexican.
Oh, I am right with you.
You think they deliver?
I told Shawn, Sergio and I are just friends, and he practically called me a liar.
Cory did the exact same thing to me.
It's like they're sharing a brain, and there's not enough for one.
Having friends of the opposite sex is such a simple idea.
Why can't they get it?
Because since the beginning of time, men have been idiots.
This will never change.
But the truth is, if my girlfriend went out dancing with somebody who looked like me, I would be insane as well.
Well, maybe we should be a little more understanding.
Yeah, we did kind of throw Sergio and Nunzio in their faces.
Ooh, that has got to hurt.
Maybe we should cut them some slack.
Hold that thought.
Okay, ladies, order anything you want.
Okay?
When you're out with us, calories don't count.
Ooh!
Chimichangas, here I come.
Nunzio!
Not even Nunzio could help you now.
Hi, guys.
Topanga, come here.
We want you to meet our friends.
Okay, this is Cookie and Sonja.
Sonja can bench-press 300 pounds.
That's very impressive.
It's nice to meet you.
Thank you.
Bring me a cola.
You got it.
Topanga, Topanga.
You didn't tell us what you think of our "friends.
" Good one.
Well, they seem like very nice, attractive, well-toned girls.
You're jealous.
You are the man.
How dumb are you?
Almost as dumb as Cory.
I told him it would backfire.
So, did Cory tell you why exactly you were here?
He said we would have a romantic dinner, and I could maybe get my green card.
I'm pretty sure I said greeting card.
They brought you here to make us, their girlfriends, jealous.
I'll be right back with your cola.
So you're just using us?
So then what happened?
I just don't get Lucy, you know?
I call her up, she says she's sick in bed, and chicken soup will make her feel better.
Mmm-hmm.
I said it probably would.
Then I went bowling.
Now she's mad at me.
Maybe she wanted you to bring her the chicken soup.
Well, why didn't she just say so?
Women, man.
They speak in code.
Hey, Mr. Feeny?
How did your date go with Kathy?
Well, it seemed to be going quite well.
I mean, she even invited me into her home.
Ooh!
Go, Feeny.
Go, Feeny.
She read me some of her poetry and asked what I thought.
And I told her.
Well, I mean, you told her you loved it, right?
I said it was promising for a beginner.
She said she'd been writing for 20 years.
And here I am.
Okay, see, that's not what she wanted to hear.
Well, then, why did she ask?
He's been chicken-souped.
Alan, it's me or that satellite dish.
You make the choice.
Hey, guys.
Angela doesn't even get me.
It's like Topanga and me are speaking different languages.
Well, one thing's obvious.
It's not us, it's them.
Yeah.
Well, now, wait a minute.
Maybe we should all just think a second.
No.
Shawn and I tried that.
It doesn't work.
Okay, I've been silent long enough.
Guys, I've been working on a theory.
Men are idiots.
What?
What?
No, wait, there's more.
All right, there it is.
Men are big idiots.
Oh.
Yeah, see that?
So what do we do?
You know, maybe we should just try listening to them.
I'm sorry.
I don't know what I was thinking.
That's crazy talk.
Maybe we should try Cory's thinking thing again.
What is the matter tonight, Topanga?
You're not enjoying Nunzio as I am enjoying Nunzio.
It's Cory.
He hasn't called me in two days.
You know, I don't care if he won't dance.
I miss him.
He misses you, too.
Of this I am sure.
I just called the apartment again.
They're not there.
Of course, they're not there.
Of this I am sure.
Oh, Topanga.
This is great.
Thank you.
Mr. Matthews is okay with this?
Oh, he is so stuck in front of that satellite TV, he doesn't even know I'm here.
He knows you are here.
Of this I am sure.
Katherine?
What are you doing here?
I love dancing.
I wish there was a way to get your neighbor here.
Come on, Topanga.
I miss Shawn, too, but let's just try to have fun.
I can't have fun.
I really want to be with Cory.
Why do men have to be so stubborn?
Ladies?
Hello.
Since the beginning of time, men have been idiots.
This will make up for it.
Where did you learn to dance?
"Everyone can learn to dance.
Of this I am sure.
" Nunzio taught you how to dance?
Yeah, but he didn't teach me how to do this.
Hey, come on.
Show me that spin move.
This little thing?
Oh, where did you learn to step like that?
Channel 728.
The Saturday Night Fever channel.
All Travolta, all the time.
You know, George, I did write another poem.
Oh, I don't have to read it.
It's wonderful.
Check this out.
You like to dance?
Um, no, thanks.
I'm not really good at dancing.
That was not a question.
Whoa!
So, have you heard of the Lord of the Dance?
It's me.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Twenty years and our aluminum tree looks good as new.
Love this tree.
I like you, Eric, but I love this tree.
Okay, please, I am just asking you, please, Topanga's gonna be staying here for Christmas, overnight.
Could we please not run naked down the hall singing We Wish You a Merry Christmas?
I'm looking at you.
I only do it because people have come to expect it.
Anything embarrassing about your dad you'd care to mention?
Well, at this stage of your life, are you capable of change?
Nope.
Okay, so just when you do it, say, "excuse me.
" Eric, come here.
What?
What do you think of this?
A ring.
This is so sweet, Cory, but I can't accept this.
We're family.
It'd be wrong.
No.
It's a promise ring for Topanga.
It means we're gonna be together forever.
That's really precious.
You guys must be the most precious couple in the universe.
You're freaks.
No naked running.
You got it?
Cor, look what I brought you for Christmas.
Look, Miss Topanga head.
Hi, guys.
Thanks for letting me spend Christmas with you.
My parents went on a cruise to Barbados, but I told them, no, I wanted to spend Christmas with Cory.
Hey, why don't we toast Topanga's first Matthews Christmas with some of my special eggnog?
Yeah!
There you are.
Mmm, this is really good.
Have you guys ever tried hot mulled cider?
No.
Nog.
We're an eggnog family.
Wait.
If this is tradition, I would never want to interfere with tradition.
It's just that, you know, my family's always had cider.
Well, we can have both, huh?
How?
How could we have both?
You ever been to the supermarket?
The cider's nowhere near the eggnog.
You know why?
They hate each other.
Go get Topanga some cider.
Gas money?
No.
Go.
I'm gonna go with him.
Listen, Topanga, is there anything else we can get for you that's gonna make your Christmas with us more enjoyable?
No, and I'm really sorry to put you guys out.
It's just that cider on Christmas is, like, my family's one tradition.
Well, that and we go to our favorite evergreen tree farm.
But everybody has one of What the heck is that?
As long as we're in Vermont, could we stop and get some syrup?
We'd be nuts not to.
This is gonna be the best Christmas ever.
Ask her if she still wants it on the 25th, Cor!
You guys, this is my first Christmas away from my family, and I just really want to thank you for making me feel like part of yours.
You're welcome, honey.
So what time on Christmas Eve do you guys open your presents?
We open them on Christmas morning.
Oh.
"Oh"?
Oh.
Oh.
Conference.
Come here.
Come here.
What?
What?
Welcome to the rest of your life.
Eric, so she opens her presents on Christmas Eve.
This isn't about the presents.
So she wanted a real tree.
This isn't about the Okay, so she makes purring noises when we make out.
But perhaps I've said too much.
Listen, what this is about is today she takes over Christmas, tomorrow it's the rest of your life.
Goodbye, Cory Matthews.
Hello, whatever your Topanga name is.
What's the big deal about when we open presents?
And my Topanga name is Captain Take-Me-Shopping.
Yeah, well, Captain, this isn't about the presents, okay?
This is about the power struggle between men and women since the creation of man over 300 years ago.
Wait till you guys see what I have to put on top of that tree.
I'll be right back.
Okay, okay.
Okay.
Hey, another conference.
Come here.
Come here.
What?
Why are you letting her walk all over you?
She is not walking all over me.
Watch, okay?
When she comes downstairs with her little ornament, I am gonna let her know that our cardboard noodle star is going on our tree, or I'm not Captain Take-Me-Shopping.
Hi, guys.
He guessed.
It was a guess.
Won't this look beautiful on top of the tree?
Topanga, I have something to say to you.
Let me guess.
You love the angel!
I love the angel.
I have failed.
Duh!
Um, hi, Topanga.
About you spending Christmas with us, the Matthews, I have a problem.
Eric, if this is about the spending limits on presents, I'm sorry.
I just saw something that was so Eric, and I had to get it.
I love you.
Welcome to our family.
Okay, okay.
Hello.
Greetings of the season.
It's Christmas Carol time.
I love A Christmas Carol.
Yeah.
Every year, Mr. Feeny comes over and reads it to us.
No one ever asks him to.
He just does.
Tradition.
You know what might be fun?
Tradition.
What if instead of you just reading the story, we all took parts and acted them out?
Cory, did someone express a problem with how I read this last year?
Because if I was a little slow, I could always pick up the pace.
Morgan would have a blast playing Tiny Tim.
I'm gonna go tell her.
But I'm Tiny Tim.
And Scrooge.
And all of them.
I'm sorry.
She likes things done her own way, but it's just one time of year, you know?
It's not my whole life.
It's just Christmas.
And every morning when she tells me what to wear.
Nice shirt.
So, Jack, how do you usually celebrate Christmas?
We usually go to Val d'Isere and ski the French Alps.
How about you?
Well, those of us in the trailer park just like to thank God for all that we have this time of year.
We pray on the plane.
Okay, two brothers, not a whole lot in common.
Nothing alike whatsoever.
So how should we celebrate Christmas?
I don't think it's important what we do as long as we do it together.
So what do we do?
Hey, when I was a kid, I used to always wonder what it'd be like to celebrate Christmas with my brother.
Now I'm gonna get that chance.
This is gonna be the best Christmas ever.
So what do you want to do?
Cory.
Cory, wake up.
Topanga?
I mean, Topanga, you frisky little girl, come in.
No.
I'm here because I couldn't sleep.
Well, I think you need a nice little snuggle, so come in.
No, I'm not here to "come in.
" Then why did you wake me up?
I was wondering what you were doing.
At 3:00 in the morning?
I'm usually sleeping and dreaming, and in my dream, I said, "come in," and you did.
Don't you ever wake up in the middle of the night?
Not once ever.
Why?
Well, to think about things.
What sort of things are you thinking about?
Like, I know that Eric likes his eggnog and that your father loves his aluminum tree, and I know that you understand that I have my traditions, too.
And you're okay with that, aren't you?
Well, yeah.
I mean, we all have our own traditions.
In fact, one of my favorite is sleeping when it's dark.
'Cause, you know, Cory, we're not the same people, and sometimes the way that I would do things is totally different than the way that you would do things.
Yeah, I know that.
I knew you would.
It's just good to know that for the rest of our lives, you'll get up with me at 3:00 in the morning to talk about things.
Good night.
Now I'm up.
Dad, what are you doing up in the middle of the night?
I'm always up now.
How come?
Oh, every night I just wish that I can make it to the morning without that tap, tap, tap.
"Alan, are you up"?
"Yes, pumpkin.
" Then those words, "Let's talk.
" She talks until she falls asleep, and then I make models.
Zoom!
Why are you up?
Topanga.
She also likes to get up at 3:00 in the morning.
You know, Dad, she's been here for less than eight hours, and I'm just now finding out all these new things about her.
And that's bad?
Yeah.
I mean, I always thought we were so much alike, and I thought that's why we get along so well.
Oh.
So just when you get to the point where you think that she's you, you find out that she's her.
So what do I do?
I've been saving one of these for each of my sons.
Enjoy.
Merry Christmas Eve morning, sleepyhead.
Morning.
I made you my traditional Christmas Eve morning breakfast.
Pancakes shaped like Christmas trees.
Thank you.
Oh, no.
No syrup.
We drove to Vermont for it.
These trees get snow.
You know, I'm not really that hungry.
I think I'm gonna take the garbage cans out front.
Silly, there's no collection on Christmas Eve day.
Actually, I was gonna hang out there till the 4th of January.
Somebody got up on the wrong side of the bed.
Here, a glass of orange juice will wake you up.
Thanks.
So Ah!
What?
This isn't orange juice!
Well, I squeezed in some grapefruit.
But why?
Orange juice on its own is very delightful.
Cory, you're a little tense.
Why don't we go for a walk?
Along the way, I'll show you the route we'll take when we go caroling.
No.
Topanga, you know I can't sing.
It's Christmas.
We'll sing together.
No, you're not hearing me.
I can't sing.
I don't like to sing.
I get embarrassed when I sing.
It's just singing.
No, it's not just singing.
I like opening presents on Christmas morning.
I miss our aluminum tree.
You're right, you know, we're two different people, and we're not gonna change that.
Boy, you're with somebody for 32 years, you think you know them.
You walked out on Topanga on Christmas Eve day?
Cory, go back.
No.
I'm not gonna go back.
You know, Jack, he doesn't realize how lucky he is to have a girl like Topanga.
I don't really know her.
You know, I was gonna give her this ring, Shawn, you know?
I was gonna give her this ring that meant that we're gonna be together forever.
Okay?
But then I started learning all these new things about her.
What kind of human being puts grapefruit juice in orange juice?
Cory, I am but a simple idiot, but the one thing I do know is that you and Topanga are just like grapefruit juice and orange juice.
Okay?
You shouldn't be together, yet somehow you are.
You know, I'm sure I'll get to know her.
And if I don't, I don't.
Well, Merry Christmas, everyone.
Shawn, you know, I thought Topanga and I were exactly alike, but we're not.
We're different people.
But I guess it's better I found this out now.
Cory, you want to talk about different people?
Me and Jack, don't have one thing in common.
Nothing.
We're spending Christmas together trying to find one similarity.
Hey, some girl's here to see you.
Now, Cory, I know you're upset with me.
I'm sorry, I love you, and if you never want to go caroling with me, you don't have to.
I'm sorry that my family's traditions are different than your family's.
I'll just be waiting for you back at your house whenever you want to come home.
Go after her, Cory.
It's Christmas.
No, I need to think.
If Topanga won't let me fall asleep listening to Feeny read A Christmas Carol, I'm gonna fall asleep watching it on TV.
Okay.
Do whatever you want, but I'm going ice skating.
Wait a minute.
You like ice skating?
I love ice skating.
I love ice skating, too.
You're kidding!
No!
Now we got something in common, man!
All right!
Yeah!
Let's go ice skating.
All right.
And every Christmas, we'll go ice skating.
We're starting a tradition right here.
I especially love ice skating in France.
Don't kill this.
Okay.
And now we return to Charles Dickens' immortal classic, A Christmas Carol.
Mr. Matthews, wake up!
Mr. Feeny.
I am not Feeny.
I am the Ghost of Christmas Future.
No.
You're a doorman at the Plaza Hotel.
You were watching A Christmas Carol and you fell asleep.
Now I am here to show you what will become of you if you stick to the path you have chosen.
I don't want to play.
Well, hey, look, there's Eric.
See, everything's the same.
Hey, bro.
He can't hear you.
This is Christmas future.
Well, look who lost his looks.
Cory, I'm home!
Got your aluminum tree, your eggnog, and I had your pants let out!
Now, why would I need my pants let out?
Oh, I'm a big boy.
Once you let Topanga out of your life, you took comfort in food.
Not just any food, for some inexplicable reason, you eat only one thing.
Breakfast, lunch, dinner, Gosh.
Okay, Mr. Feeny, I want you to show me how horrible and miserable Topanga ended up without me.
Oh, you don't want to see this, Mr. Matthews.
It's pretty grim, huh?
Show me.
Topanga.
She's beautiful.
But she's alone, isn't she?
I guess that's what happens when you have to have everything your own way.
Look at that.
She even has to have wood delivered.
Probably no husband around to chop it for her.
Hey, wait a minute, that's Jack.
I don't really know you too well, but thanks for marrying me.
Well, obviously, it's a loveless marriage.
Those are supposed to be my kids.
All right, children, it's Christmas Eve.
Time to open presents.
You see that?
Everything her own way.
Look at the tree.
It's aluminum.
Topanga would never have an aluminum tree.
How did Jack get her to do that?
Perhaps he never ran out of the house like a coward.
Perhaps he realized that the spirit of love brings compromise, that when two people grow together, they start their own traditions.
You know everything, don't you?
Oh, no, Mr. Matthews.
This is your dream.
I'm merely in it.
Topanga, I'm sorry, okay?
We can have Christmas your way.
And the next year, maybe we can have it my way.
And the year after, we can have a combination of both of our ways, with the emphasis on your way.
She can't hear you.
Topanga, I love you.
I love you, too, Jack.
Come, Mr. Matthews.
Time to go.
I really thought Cory would be back by now.
This is all my fault.
Hello.
If I would have never come here, Cory would have never run away.
I've ruined your Christmas.
I just wanted so much to be part of your family.
I never wanted to push Cory away.
Hi.
Hi.
Merry Christmas.
Cory.
It's a promise ring.
It means that we're gonna be together forever.
You mean you want to be together with me even though we're so different from each other?
Yeah.
And don't get me a present this year, because, you already did.
You know, I thought I knew everything about you, but I'm just starting to find out.
It's good we're different.
Yeah, it is.
Open your present.
It's a promise ring.
And now for my favorite part of the holidays.
A Christmas Carol, by Charles Dickens.
"A Christmas Carol, by Charles Dickens," as read by George Feeny.
"Marley was dead, "to begin with.
"There was no doubt whatever about that.
"The registrar of his burial was signed by the clergyman, "the clerk, the undertaker "And so, as Tiny Tim observed, "God bless us, every one.
" Bah, humbug!
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Oh, oh, oh.
Oh, in your face!
This is for the game.
Not in my house.
Your house?
I pay the mortgage.
All right, I got next.
There is no next, Cor.
This is for the Matthews Championship!
Well, I'm a Matthews.
No!
Eric is the king!
All right, rematch.
Rematch.
No, no, no, no, no.
New season starts tomorrow.
Don't get fat in the off-season.
I gotta hit the showers.
All right, Dad.
Come on.
Let's go.
No, Cor.
No.
I'm wiped.
I played two hours of racquetball with Eric this morning.
You were just gonna play Eric.
Come on.
Well, that was for the championship.
All right, fine.
This will be for our championship.
Come on.
Cor, I told you.
I got nothing.
Here.
You take it out.
Maybe tomorrow, all right?
What?
If Eric's not around?
Come on.
What?
Never mind, Dad.
Give me the ball.
What?
So you can throw it at me again?
No, forget it.
No, knock it off.
Give me the Just give me the ball.
What is wrong with you?
Dad, I'm Alan, what happened?
Ask your son.
I swear I don't know anything.
Cor?
I just wanted to play.
Oh, yeah.
Hey, the super told me to tell you that the people above us let their bathtub overflow, and whatever you do, don't Don't poke at the big bubble on my ceiling?
Yeah.
You got the message?
Yeah.
Just now.
My whole room's flooded, and there's a half a bathtub hanging over my bed.
So stay in my room.
So when people throw garbage down the chute, this is where it winds up, huh?
Are you calling me a pig?
A pig would never live in here.
Oh, yeah?
I'm sleeping out on the couch, man.
Shawn, I need to sleep on your couch.
What happened?
I got into a fight with my dad.
Everybody gets into a fight with their dad.
Yeah.
I knocked him down.
That's not quite as common.
I wanted to play basketball with him, like he does with Eric.
I can't believe you hit your dad.
Now, does he have to leave the house in shame?
Do you get his woman?
Well, I didn't actually hit him.
I shoved him, and he went down.
He does all these things with Eric.
Why won't he do things with me?
Well, he's afraid you're gonna hit him again.
Eric has the good relationship with him.
You know that?
They ski together.
They go camping together.
I even heard them planning on jumping out of a plane together.
All we do is talk.
Cory, you have a great relationship with your dad.
I'm not gonna go through the rest of my life as the guy my father talked to.
You know?
Great conversations are not memories you look back on.
You have tons of memories with your dad.
Like what?
Like the time you beat him up.
You're gonna talk about that for years.
George It's 2:00 in the morning.
Is everything okay?
No, Alan.
Everything's not okay.
I know what happened this afternoon between you and Cory.
Yeah?
I waited for you.
I waited for Cory.
Nothing.
Nobody came over.
Something like this happens, somebody should come over.
I mean, he knocked you on your keister, man.
You're obviously upset, so, please, can we talk about it so I can get some sleep?
You want to come in, George?
Well, yes.
I'm making a little snack.
Help yourself.
Don't mind if I do.
You know, George, I mean, it's one thing for the boys to ask for your help, but I am a capable adult.
I can handle this on my own.
You are absolutely right, and I am sorry that I intruded on your privacy.
He pushed me down, George.
My own son pushed me down.
Doesn't sound like Cory.
No, it doesn't.
I mean, he knows if anything is bothering him, he can come and talk to me.
I mean, talking is the basis of our relationship.
Maybe that's what's bothering him.
You never stop teaching, do you, George?
Next time, don't keep me up all night.
Are you insane?
What?
Who sleeps with the light on?
Me, okay?
When I was a kid, our trailer park was right next to an off-ramp.
All night long, truck headlights shone through the window.
The light comforts me.
You know, when the teamsters went on strike in '82, I didn't sleep till there was a settlement.
That's a really lovely story.
It'd make a great children's book.
Here's another great children's book, Good Night, Light.
Good night, Shawn.
Good night, pig.
Hey!
Hey, Jack, you're a guest in my room.
Why don't you start behaving like one?
The pig has a name.
It's Little Cory.
Fine.
Good night, Little Cory.
Good night, pig.
Good night.
Crickets?
It's a tape.
Sounds of the Trailer Park.
It helps me sleep.
It's actually kind of soothing.
Shut up!
Shut up!
Drop the weapon and come out!
Get up!
Get up.
Get up.
Hey!
Hey.
God, I wouldn't have asked you to stay here if I knew you were gonna be so weird.
Oh!
Oh.
I'm weird?
You know what puts me to sleep?
A glass of milk, not the truck that delivers the milk.
But you'll have to excuse me.
I was raised in an actual house.
Oh.
I see.
Well, as long as you put it that way, I would be happy to turn out your lights.
I wouldn't, man.
Piedmont Prep boxing team!
Come on.
Let's go.
You know, if I really wanted to hit you, I would have.
Well, when you want to, I'll be right here, asleep in the dark, like normal people.
Cory.
Cory.
What?
Cory, get up.
No.
I don't want to get up.
I hit my father.
That's gotta be a bad sin.
If this were the Bible, I'd be a father smiter.
I'd be Cory, son of Alan the bruised.
Cory, you've got a great relationship with your father.
You know what?
You shouldn't be here.
If they find you here with me, they'll stone you.
Save yourself, Topanga, daughter of Miriam.
Cory, go home and talk this out with him.
No.
That's the whole point, Topanga.
All we do is talk.
You know, that's all our relationship is.
That's not like him and Eric.
They do stuff together.
Well, I wanna do stuff, too.
I never want to talk to him again!
You're coming with us.
Can we talk about this?
Okay!
You've successfully completed the ground course!
Welcome to your first jump!
Yeah!
I actually, I wasn't paying attention on the ground, and I feel I shouldn't be allowed up here!
You know what I love?
It's the drama!
You know, like, will the chute open or will it not?
This isn't fair!
When you hit the ground, you were not 10,000 feet above it!
Now, Cory, this is something Eric and I have been talking about doing.
There's no reason you shouldn't be a part of it!
So this isn't because I pushed you down?
Well, yes, it is because you pushed me down.
You know, if you're that upset about something, I have to take a hard look at what I'm doing wrong.
I just feel like I want to do things with you, not just talk about stuff.
Well, Cory, I don't do things with Eric because I don't want to do them with you.
It's just the way Eric and I relate.
Yeah.
Dad just doesn't look at you as as much of an action-adventure guy as he looks at me, Cor.
But it takes real guts just to get up here in the first place.
You did good.
You don't wanna have to jump, you don't have to.
No, no, no!
If this is what you guys do, I'm with you guys.
Okay, Cor, that's great.
If you wanna jump with us, then you jump, or if you wanna play basketball or baseball or whatever, I'll be there, but just promise me one thing.
I don't want to lose that part of our relationship that I consider most special!
What?
What?
What?
Special part!
The relationship!
What part is special?
I love when we talk!
You do?
You do?
Yeah!
You know, I enjoy your opinions and your views on things, and I wouldn't trade being able to talk to you for anything!
You tell me this now?
Well, yeah!
I mean, what good is playing basketball or throwing around a football if you don't have good conversation, right, Dad?
All right!
We're at the jump point!
Remember, in the rare but not impossible event that your chute fails to deploy, just pull on your red ripcord, which will engage your backup chute!
What do you mean, "fail to open"?
What do you mean, "deploy"?
Ready to go?
Okay, okay!
Let's do it!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Cory, wait!
You know, now that we've got our relationship back on track, why don't we, you know, go home, play basketball or something?
Why?
Because you're afraid I can't keep up with you guys, huh?
Well, watch this!
He did it!
Come on, boy.
Go!
Go get 'em!
Go get 'em!
Hey, how come I don't have that special relationship like you have with Cory?
What?
What?
What?
Well, like, do you value my views and opinions on things?
Good!
His chute opened!
That's great.
Listen, all we ever do is buddy stuff.
We have nothing!
I want more!
From this moment on, you gotta start listening to my views on philosophy, politics, and what makes the universe go round!
I don't think so!
Hey, I'm talking to you!
You are going down, Matthews.
Not in my house, Matthews!
Come on.
Oh, no!
You jumped out of a plane rather than talk to me.
No.
You're You're exaggerating.
The wind sucked me out like a vacuum.
You hit the ground and started running!
Momentum.
I just wanted to talk to you, you know, like you do with Cory.
Eric, I'm in the middle of a game here.
Talk to me.
No.
Give me the ball.
Look, just talk to me.
Give me the ball.
All right, fine.
Here.
Did you push him again?
Dad, are you okay?
No, no!
Stay away from me.
You awake?
What kind of moron are you?
I can't take this.
You live like a pig, and you do weird things during the night.
Like what?
Like you talk in your sleep, and you snore.
Nice try, Jack, but that's impossible, okay?
Either I talk or I snore.
You can't do both.
Oh, yeah?
I'm going to the market to pick up some eggs.
Rub two eggs together, and you'll get a spark.
My head's on fire.
Someone please put it out.
Hey.
Hey!
You taped over my Sounds of the Trailer Park tape!
Yeah, I did.
Go to the car wash and buy a new one.
I don't own a car, and if I did, Jack, I would have the pride to wash it myself, you hoity-toity, stuck-up, middle-class snot!
Just 'cause you want to live like a pig doesn't mean I have to.
Well, yes, it does.
You're my guest, and this is my room.
Oh, really?
Okay.
Here!
How about this?
What's all this?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
You're upsetting my pig!
Now, come on.
Clean this up!
Make me.
Hello, Philly General?
Have any middle-aged men been admitted this afternoon with basketball injuries?
That many, huh?
Eric.
How'd you find me?
You live here.
Not anymore.
I'm volunteering for the Witness Protection Program.
Eric, you didn't witness any crime.
I hit my father, and I saw the whole thing.
By this time tomorrow, I'll no longer be your brother.
I'll be Dr. Abraham Shapiro of Passaic, New Jersey, cardiologist.
Eric, Dad's fine.
What's gotten into you?
All we ever do is pal around, you know?
That's what our relationship is.
It's not like the relationship you have with Dad.
I mean, I want to talk to him, too.
Well, you and Dad talk.
Yeah, we talk.
We talk about the Sixers and the Flyers and the Baywatch chicks.
I mean, you know.
I don't know.
I want to talk about important stuff like you guys do.
It's time people learned who the real Eric was.
Dr. Shapiro.
You come in here!
You criticize my room!
You spook my pig, and you turn out my light!
So?
So, maybe I like the way I live!
Maybe I wasn't born with my life on a silver spoon!
Yeah.
I like the way I was brought up!
I like the way I was brought up.
The only thing I didn't like is I didn't get to know my brother.
Now say, "uncle.
" I don't know who my uncle is!
I would've liked to know him, too.
His name's Dave!
His name's Dave.
He's in the corrugated box business.
I can't breathe.
We weren't fighting about the messy room, were we?
Just think, all those years we didn't know each other, we could've been beating the crap outta each other.
I've waited 17 years to do this.
Oh, yeah?
Well, back at you.
Now say, "uncle.
" Uncle!
Say "uncle" to your big brother!
Uncle!
Uncle Dave in the box business!
Yes.
Yes.
What's the score?
Sons, two.
Dad, nothing.
Amy, what am I doing wrong here?
You really want to know?
I'm not doing anything wrong.
I am a very good father.
Yes, you are.
You are a very good father to your son and your daughter.
We have two sons.
We do?
Here it comes.
Alan, remember how we always wanted a boy and a girl?
Yeah.
Well, on the way to getting there, we got two boys.
Two complete boys that want a complete relationship with their dad, and now they are calling you on it.
They have a complete relationship with me.
No, they don't.
No, they don't.
No.
Cory gets your mind, and Eric gets the Wide World of Sports.
Well, that's just the way we are together.
No!
Alan, you are the father.
You have defined the relationships.
Honey, be proud that we have raised them so well that they can tell you they want more.
We have two boys.
Yeah, we do.
Well, that's even better.
Yeah, it is.
Dr. Shapiro.
So why did you guys bring me to a museum?
Well, I wanted to do something with you that I've done on occasion with Cory.
I came here with my school once, and I really liked it, so I told Dad about it, and we've been here a couple times.
What we like to do, we pick out a piece and then we try and guess what the artist is trying to say.
How about this one?
It's fascinating.
Topanga and I plan to own one someday.
What do you think the artist is trying to say, Eric?
It's abstract.
It means what it means.
There's no right or wrong.
A monkey.
Two monkeys, and they're fighting over a coconut, which symbolizes the father monkey's attention.
Uh, this may not have been a good idea.
Well, Dad, it is open to interpretation, you know?
My interpretation is that the artist is illustrating a very painful situation, where the father monkey has two sons, but only one coconut, so he splits the coconut in half, but only a half a coconut isn't enough for either son.
Uh-huh.
So, what kind of art you wanna talk about now?
Neoclassicism?
Impressionism?
Photographic art?
Ansel Adams, American landscape?
He's probably my favorite, but you didn't know that.
No, I I didn't.
How do you know about all this?
I learned about it at school.
We just, you know, never talked about it.
Didn't think you'd want to hear it from me.
I just always tried to be the person I thought you wanted me to be.
You know, I'd really love to hear what you have to say about this piece.
I would love to tell you.
What you doing, Dad?
Taking down this hoop.
No good can come from it.
Hey, Morgan.
We have a pretty good relationship, right?
I guess so.
Yeah.
We talk, right?
Yeah.
And we have fun, right?
Yeah.
I should've had all girls.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
An interesting thing happened when I was grading this assignment, Mr. Hunter.
Yours wasn't there.
Oh!
I can explain that.
I was speaking to Mr. Hunter.
Well, see, Shawn and I, we think so much alike that we decided to write one paper.
Really?
Yeah.
Then you won't mind sharing your grade.
No.
All right.
So what do we get?
Well, this was a well thought out paper.
It deserves a B. Very fair.
Divided by two, makes a D for you and a D for you.
Hey!
Still fair.
Still good.
But, Mr. Feeny, come on.
It's the middle of our senior year.
Okay, why are you being so tough on us with these assignments?
You know, you're right.
Let's forget about those D's.
Make it two F's.
No!
Don't fail them.
Ah!
The third musketeer chimes in.
An F follows you around for the rest of your life.
Okay.
We'll take your D's.
Our college applications are already in.
Yeah, well, yours are.
What, you haven't sent your college applications in?
Shawn, I filled them out for you.
Cory, don't start, okay?
What's the point?
People like me don't go to college.
Do your assignments, Mr. Hunter, and you'll go to college.
And if I get in, how am I supposed to afford it, huh?
There's just so many things standing in the way.
Besides, I mean, why are we doing all these assignments?
They're just busywork.
What's left to learn?
Uh Mr. Feeny, he just means that we've been here four years, and there's nothing really left that you can teach us.
Whoa!
Look at Feeny, man.
Feeny, you okay?
Shawn!
This is that moment that we talked about.
Yeah, he's definitely gonna blow.
Stand up.
Okay.
This is bad.
The rest of the class, please leave.
Bad, bad.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Mr. Feeny, why don't you just give them a makeup assignment?
Don't fail them.
You'd better stay, too, you little control freak.
So, just because you sent in your college applications, nothing that I teach you from now on means anything?
I was just having this discussion with them the other day.
Quiet!
You yelled at me.
But I'm Topanga.
Shawn, I want this assignment brought to my house by 5:00 this afternoon.
This afternoon today?
That's impossible.
Oh, no.
He's keyed into something you said.
This afternoon today?
Why doesn't he just ask me to come up with tickets to the Super Bowl?
Mr. Hunter, here's your new assignment, to come up with two tickets to the Super Bowl by the end of the week.
Oh, come on, Mr. Feeny Quiet!
You yelled at me.
But I'm Topanga.
Mr. Feeny, what are you so upset about?
Miss Lawrence, I have an assignment for you as well.
Butt out of other people's lives for one week.
Otherwise, you get an F. But I've never failed before.
There's a first time for everything.
That argument doesn't get you anywhere with her.
And as for you, Mr. Matthews, since you feel so responsible for your friends' fate, I put their fate in your hands.
Their success is your success.
But if either of them fails, so do you.
Thanks a lot, Topanga.
Hey.
Didn't hear you come in last night.
Must have had a pretty good time on your date, huh?
The evening began at 7:00.
It started with some intimate pre-dinner conversation at a quaint little Mexican place I happen to know.
Came back here and Let's just say my clothes were off within five minutes.
You opened your big mouth.
She walked out.
You ate alone at Taco Bell, came home, took off all your clothes, and were asleep by 8:00.
How'd you do?
Not as good.
Jack, what are we gonna do?
I don't know.
It's not us.
No, it is not us.
You know who it is?
Them.
All of them.
We need to make a change.
Yeah.
It's time to be more choosy, my friend, find women who are more compatible.
You know something?
You're right.
No more randomly just picking out women, hoping that they like us.
I say we embark upon a mission to find our perfect companions, our soul mates.
What about them?
Hey, you two!
No, not Yeah, okay, you!
Today's forecast is chilly in Philly as the record-breaking cold snap continues.
Okay.
What do you got?
I got four can't-miss ways on how to get Super Bowl tickets.
Okay.
Give me the best one.
I go back in time to the first Super Bowl when tickets weren't that hard to get.
Good.
Good.
Very good.
I don't need to hear the other three.
If you're gonna go back in time, you could do the original assignment, and we wouldn't be in this mess.
Tra-la-la-la-la Topanga, butting in in musical form is still butting in.
Oh!
Oh!
Ask Topanga.
That was my next idea.
We get advice from Topanga.
If I give advice, I get an F. You can afford one stinking F in your life.
No!
I can't!
I've worked very hard to be perfect up till now.
I am throwing up.
I am throwing up all over you.
Okay!
Are you ready to win some Super Bowl tickets?
Okay.
If I was a pair of Super Bowl tickets, how would I find me?
It's an interesting question, Shawn.
Another interesting question, why would Feeny make such an impossible assignment?
We've got the last pair of Super Bowl tickets available in the known universe!
And we're down to 10 more chances to win them, so call me now.
Topanga!
Will you turn down the radio?
We're trying to think here.
No jazzercise in the kitchen.
And we're down to our five final callers.
555-wkzn.
That's 555-wkzn.
I think she's trying to tell us something.
Well, you know her better than I do.
Okay, okay.
Bowl.
Can.
There's trouble in the Balkans?
Is that what the radio said, girl?
Soup.
Bowl.
Soup or bowl.
All right, soup.
555-wkzn, 102.5, and we're down to our last caller for a chance to go to the Super Bowl!
Hey!
They're giving away tickets to the Super Bowl.
And we almost missed it!
Thanks a lot, Topanga!
Hello?
Yeah?
I'm caller 20!
Yes!
What?
I gotta do what?
If you're wondering why everybody's looking up at the sky, it's because there are people on that billboard!
Hey, hey, this is Johnny Latte from the 102.5 wkzn morning zoo!
And we're coming at you live from our billboard in downtown Philadelphia, where it's a crisp and clean, no-caffeine 16 degrees out here.
Let's check out our remaining four Our remaining three freezing contestants.
I'm here with a small but very loyal crowd of well-wishers.
Jump!
And the obligatory lunatic.
We'll be back with hour 32 of our Super Bowl madness right after this word from The Bahamas.
We are warm and you are cold We are warm and you are cold We don't need We are warm and you are cold We Hey, hey!
How are you?
I brought you some hot chocolate.
Thank you so much, Cory.
Wait a minute.
I can't do this.
This isn't right.
That's it.
I don't even like football.
I like billboards, and you've ruined this for me.
Well, okay!
One more guy down.
Shawn, there's only one more guy, and we're at the Super Bowl.
I can't win this, Cory.
No, no!
Of course you can win.
You've made it down to one more guy, and I'm here to help you.
What can I do for you?
Cory, look at the other guy.
The other guy's an Eskimo.
And he's eating an ice-cream cone.
He's from the Inuit tribe.
He comes to Philadelphia with his family every January for summer vacation.
I am warm and you are cold Hey!
I really thought I had a chance to go to the Super Bowl, but I guess I never really did, huh?
There's always gonna be an Eskimo standing in my way, isn't there, Cory?
Come on.
I'll help you down.
This whole thing was impossible.
Feeny knew that.
All right, Mr. Feeny, we got this one figured out.
You got the Super Bowl tickets?
This was never about Super Bowl tickets.
It wasn't?
You don't think we know you, Mr. Feeny?
You don't think we know that when you're teaching us something, we should look for the lesson behind the lesson?
Well, we looked, and we figured this one out all by ourselves.
And I didn't even help them, Mr. Feeny.
Even though we think something's impossible, we still should have tried because that's all you wanted.
You wanted us to try.
And even though it's not important to do work during our senior year, we should still make you think we're trying.
You see?
You see how I haven't given them any advice on what to say?
I don't fail.
I don't.
Now, aren't you proud of us, Mr. Feeny, huh?
Where are the Super Bowl tickets?
"Where are the tickets"?
Good one.
You know we don't have any tickets!
Mr. Feeny, that No, Miss Lawrence.
All you had to do was stay out of it.
And you had to help them succeed.
That was the assignment.
Now, where are the tickets?
Mr. Feeny, I really tried.
We know that's what you wanted.
You have no idea what I want.
Get the tickets or fail.
Mr. Feeny Stay out of it or fail.
Mr. Feeny, come on.
How are we Help them both or fail.
Thanks a lot, Topanga.
What are you doing?
They'll be here any minute.
I have a psych test on Monday.
You see, this is why you'll never end up with any woman worth having.
We finally met two girls that are different than any other girls we've ever dated before.
Why?
Because they're coming back!
You know why they're coming back?
Because they see in us what we see in them, compatibility.
We're perfect for each other.
You're putting your studies before your soul mate.
I'm studying so I can give my soul mate a nice life someday.
Do like me.
Be a secret agent.
I mean, once you're in the CIA, they take care of you for life.
Or they kill you.
Soul mates.
Oh, please!
What are the chances we just happened to find two girls who are anything like us?
What are the chances that we didn't?
Hi, Eric.
Hey, Jack.
Boy, do we have an evening planned for you.
Yeah, a wonderful little French restaurant with only four tables.
Seven courses, and we can linger for hours.
Hope you brought your fat pants, ladies.
I love French food, but I can't stay too late because I have an exam on Monday.
Hey!
Give me a couple of tacos, and I'm a happy girl.
But I got these reservations.
Taco!
I love tacos.
But he has reservations.
We can't just not show up, man!
Taco!
Well, you ready?
Okay, great.
Yeah.
Let's go.
So, Jill, tell me about yourself.
Do you have any brothers or sisters?
One sister.
We were separated when my parents divorced, but I reconnected with her when I came to Pennbrook.
Pretty weird, huh?
Unbelievable.
So, Carol, what are you studying?
You don't need to study for what I'm gonna do.
Once you're in the CIA, they take care of you for life.
Or they Kill you.
I want Carol.
Jill's perfect for me.
Jack and Jill, why didn't we see it before?
Eric and Carol?
I told you he'd be here.
No, you didn't!
You were waving a dollar and yawning at me.
Bill-bored!
How much simpler could it be?
Well, you could have just said it.
That would be butting in.
So far, I'm the only one not getting an F Foot on my head!
Foot on my head!
Hey, Lucy!
Ricky!
I'm up here trying to think.
What are you thinking about?
Whenever I've wanted anything in my life, there's always been an Eskimo standing in my way.
One word.
Sounds like Metaphor!
Oh!
You remember when you went to summer camp and I couldn't afford to?
That was an Eskimo.
Uh-huh.
All the other kids grew up in real houses with real backyards.
I grew up in a trailer park.
Eskimo.
There's just so many things standing in my way.
Well, I'm going to the Super Bowl.
Shawn, you don't have any tickets.
I don't care!
You have no way of getting there.
It doesn't matter!
Cory, people like me, we don't go anywhere because we don't believe that we can get there!
I'm my own worst Eskimo!
Shawn, listen to me.
I'm trying to help you here.
You don't have to go anywhere.
Yes, I do!
I do have to go somewhere because if I don't, I'll never go anywhere.
Now be my best friend and get out of my way.
You're sitting very close to me.
And why are you sitting next to me, anyway?
I think you're confused.
You think I'm confused?
Your name is Carol.
You want to work in espionage.
You love tacos.
You have no idea what color amber is.
Now who's confused?
I am.
And you're sitting even closer to me now.
Your studies are important to you, you appreciate French cuisine, and you want to read The Sunday Times book review section in an unfurnished apartment while you lie on the hardwood floor with your lover massaging your bare feet.
Yeah.
So?
All right.
Now you're sitting way too close.
You're hitting on me.
Am I?
Yes!
What is going on here?
Listen to me.
Carol, don't you see?
We were meant for each other.
I mean, the reason I want someone like you is because you're someone like me.
Hey.
I'm here to see Jack.
I thought you two were friends.
Best friends.
We support each other entirely.
Eric's a moron!
I lay his clothes out in the morning!
You and I belong together.
We're like peanut butter and jelly.
We're like jelly and jelly.
Jack.
I am not comfortable here.
Eric, I'd like to leave.
I'm with Carol.
How rude.
At least let me walk you home.
That way we can talk, and you can see how right we are for each other.
What is going on here?
We were just switching you around!
What's the big deal?
Wait, wait!
We just wanted to establish serious meaningful relationships.
With a couple of hotties who have the same interests we do!
Don't you want that, too?
Now, I know you do!
You, I don't know what you want.
Well, we just went out with you 'cause you were cute.
Besides, why would we want to be with someone exactly like ourselves?
Nobody makes a sandwich out of jelly and jelly!
That would be tedious and redundant.
We have the same vocabulary.
We could look those words up together.
I don't want to look those words up with you.
I want somebody who can tell me what they mean.
I spend all day with me.
You seemed like fun, and now we'll never know.
We learned an important lesson here today, Jack.
Yeah, looks like finding soul mates isn't going to be as easy as we thought.
Maybe we can't just find them.
Maybe the girls taught us we were too aggressive, and we just have to sit back and let the universe bring our soul mates to us.
You're a wise man, Jack Hunter.
I guess they're actually not coming after us.
Those idiots.
Mr. Feeny, I failed you.
As we speak, our young Shawn is foolishly rolling westward towards San Diego and certain disappointment.
Did he get the tickets?
No.
He said the tickets didn't matter.
He said nothing mattered and that he'd find a way in.
That's what he said, huh?
Yeah.
I mean, I was standing in front of him, and he asked me to move out of the way so he could go.
And did you move out of the way, Mr. Matthews?
Well, yeah.
I mean, I really felt like I should.
I know the assignment was to help him succeed, but, Mr. Feeny, it was like he didn't need my help on this one, you know?
He was gonna do this one on his own, no matter what.
Guess I failed, huh?
On the contrary, Mr. Matthews, you passed with flying colors and so does Mr. Hunter.
Of course we did.
Mmm-hmm.
And clearly you've wasted all your time, as I continue to comprehend nothing.
Cory, Shawn isn't going to go to college and succeed because you want him to.
He has to want to and believe that he can.
And the only way he can do that is on his own without your help.
Then why did you want me to help him?
You need to know you won't always be able to.
Yeah, like pretty soon we're all gonna have to do things on our own without someone's help.
Right, Mr. Feeny?
I think I understand why you've been so upset.
And I think I know why you're gonna keep giving us assignments every day until our last day with you.
Miss Lawrence, you're butting in.
Yeah, I am, so fail me.
That's life.
You won't be perfect anymore.
No one should be perfect.
Besides, you learn from failure.
And I need to know that, right?
You just yelled at me.
But I'm Mr. Feeny.
One day you're going to have to let us go.
One day you won't be able to teach us anymore, and you can't be sure if we're going to be all right.
Life is a lot tougher than school, my dears.
But the right thing to do is just step aside and let us live it.
I mean, we learned that because you taught it to us.
Oh!
What a game!
This is the best Super Bowl since Super Bowl XX!
Yes!
This makes them so happy.
What else is on?
Well, Fox is counterprogramming with America's Worst Family Atrocities.
You change that channel, and you're gonna be on that program.
Yeah!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Yeah!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Look at that!
Look at what, George?
That play's over.
I'm looking at the crowd!
Look at the boy holding up the sign!
Which one?
The one that says, "Hey, Feeny.
Nothing's impossible.
"
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
All right, everyone.
The bus will be here in a few minutes.
Now, remember, even though this ski trip is about having fun, we live in a land of laws which must be obeyed if this society is to survive.
In other words, I'll be watching you two.
All I heard was "fun.
" It's our first romantic weekend away with the girls.
And the school's picking up the tab.
Okay.
I was able to obtain a blueprint of the ski lodge.
Our room is here.
The girls' room is here.
Feeny's room is right in the middle.
Huh!
He's a sly one.
At precisely 2:00 a. m. you will sneak from our room to Feeny's door to check for snoring.
Rhythmic or intermittent?
Rhythmic!
I told you rhythmic!
Am I alone in this?
Okay, okay, rhythmic snoring confirmed.
Then I proceed to sneak over to the girls' room, and I tell Angela that you're dreaming and calling out her name.
She then walks down the hallway, past a snoring Feeny, to your room.
While you're with Angela, I'm gonna be busy keeping Topanga occupied until Angela returns.
Many hours later.
You know, maybe we should tell the girls about our top-secret plans, you know, so we don't spring it on them.
What?
No, no, no, no, no.
Cory, Cory, Cory.
You are so naive.
The women want to come to our room.
They just need some lame excuse, and we are just the guys to give it to them.
I love skiing.
Look at those two.
You know what they're planning, don't you?
Yeah, the midnight switch.
You gotta love the effort.
Yeah, it looks like they're working hard, too.
I see diagrams.
You know, the humane thing to do would be to tell them they don't have a prayer.
Oh, sure.
But the fun thing to do is We love you.
Never gonna happen.
All right, everyone.
The bus is here.
Now, remember, I don't want another incident like last year's fiasco in the Amish country.
Why is everyone looking at me?
Someone's planning a romantic weekend, huh?
Well, it is a weekend without our parents, so you can't blame me for thinking about it.
I'm thinking about it, too.
Really?
Yeah.
But it might be more romantic if you talked to me about our weekend plans instead of Shawn.
Okay.
That could be.
That could be.
We start by tipping the guy so he stops the ski lift at around sunset.
Uh-huh.
And then there's no one around to keep you warm except me.
I get so cold.
And what do you do?
And what do you do?
Well, I'd put you in front of the fireplace, and we'd do some of this, and we'd drink hot chocolate and do some of this.
You see how we like all the same things, Cory?
Yeah.
Listen Let's never get off the couch, okay?
Well, that doesn't leave us a lot of time for skiing.
Oh!
There's plenty of time to ski.
We're gonna be together for the rest of our lives.
Ow!
It's broken!
It's broken in seven places!
Give me 50 cc's of St. Joseph's Chewable Aspirin, stat!
The slopes are treacherous.
He fell getting off the bus.
Those buses are treacherous.
Hmm.
Well, I don't think anything's broken.
It's probably just a mild sprain.
Embellish it for my friends.
I'll have the doctor come and embellish it for you.
My guess is, you'll live but you won't ski.
Sorry.
Well, there goes our senior ski weekend, huh?
No, Cory, we can have a great weekend here together.
We can sit here while everybody else is out playing in the snow and skiing and having fun, and we can talk about how much fun they're having without us.
Go ski.
Thank you.
No, go ahead.
Go.
Shawn never would've left me.
Hey, Cory, get your foot out of Ski injury.
I hit a little ice patch on Devil's Run.
Devil's Run is closed this weekend.
Then what I did was insane.
So, how about some hot chocolate, insane person?
Well, I'd get you some, but my foot really hurts.
No, I'll get it for us.
It's part of my job.
This must be a great place to work.
Yeah, but during the day it gets a little quiet 'cause everyone's out on the hill and I'm stuck inside.
Well, I guess today you're stuck with me.
I've been stuck with worse.
Thanks.
Do you play backgammon?
My middle name is backgammon.
What's your first name?
Cory.
Mine's Lauren.
We spent two hours on a jigsaw puzzle, and half the pieces are missing?
Yeah, these idiots keep putting the money into the snow-making equipment and completely skimp on the puzzle budget.
How do they stay in business?
You know, you can still see the picture if you use a little imagination.
Yeah, there's a curly-haired kid falling off a bus.
And a cute mountain girl coming to his rescue.
Cory, I had so much fun.
I got on the wrong lift, and wound up doing six runs with the Olympic team.
Good for you.
No, but the best part is I think I'm gonna be in a ChapStick commercial.
Good for you.
I'm sorry, Cory, you must be so bored.
Ok, I'll change out of my ski suit, and when I get back, we'll spend the rest of the night together, okay?
Looks like you'll be in good hands.
Here.
Your own piece of the mountain.
Keep it as a souvenir.
Lauren.
Thanks.
It's been the best day with a mildly sprained ankle I've ever had.
Well, somebody's got a crush.
Lauren's just being nice, that's all.
Cory.
You think I don't know you better than anybody?
Shawn, Lauren's being nice to me because it's her job.
Okay?
As a matter of fact, after today, I'm not planning on spending any more time with her.
Cory, you think I don't know you better than anybody?
Okay, Topanga, it's your turn.
If you could change your mate into one animal, what pet would it be and why?
Please, nothing fuzzy-wuzzy.
A falcon.
Yes!
A falcon, the hunter of all that is fuzzy-wuzzy.
No, a falcon, because I want you to be free to soar majestically as long as I know that you'll always come back to me.
If I ever get like that, kill me.
I would have to.
Hey, Lauren!
Why don't you join us?
No, Lauren's probably got better things to do.
Oh, no.
Yes, please come join us.
We could use someone whose answers aren't so pukey.
You know, I could take you.
You don't wanna dance with me, girl.
You don't see me running, do you?
Bring it on, Topanga.
Oh, it's on.
All right, chick fight!
Move the table.
Ready?
Ready!
Oh, no!
Help!
Stop, stop, stop.
You guys look comfortable enough without me.
No, no, no, come on, let's keep playing.
You can ask the next question.
Cory's up.
Is it hot in here, or is it just me?
Because I'm hot, okay?
So I can't be the only one who's hot, so who's hot?
Well, maybe you're sitting too close to the fire.
Why would you say that?
I can't believe you said that.
Okay.
If you had an affair, do you think the guilt would change your behavior?
Where do they come up with that?
Why, I mean, that is such a crazy question.
I mean, why would they ask me that question?
Me?
The falcon!
I mean, everyone knows that falcons are notoriously monogamous birds.
I mean, it's just so crazy.
I can't believe it.
Oh, wow!
Oh, now I'm exhausted.
Me, too.
I'm going to bed.
Well, I'm right behind you.
I mean, I'm going to my room.
Right?
That's where I'm going?
Right.
That's where you're going.
Right.
Right.
I'll be in my room.
Reading.
The Bible.
Wait, I'm not tired.
Who wants to see a movie?
Then, Cory, you can stay up, but don't stay up too late because I want my Cory falcon flying down the slopes with me tomorrow, okay?
Good night.
Good night, Lauren.
Good night.
Well, I better get some sleep, too.
Yeah, go ahead.
I'm just gonna sit here, let the fire die down and watch the moon rise over the mountains.
Sounds nice.
I've never done anything like that before 'cause I'm from the city.
And in the city we don't see that many stars because of what they call Ambient light.
Right.
Ambient light.
I was raised in the city, too.
Philadelphia?
Mmm-mmm.
New York.
But we moved when I was 13.
I thought I'd hate living in the mountains, but now I wouldn't live anywhere else.
Well, I'm from the city.
I could only live in the city, you know.
Couldn't live without that ambient light.
In fact, I don't want to see anything in the sky.
Look.
Okay.
Wow, there's so many stars up there.
It's so beautiful.
You were distracted by the city lights.
The fire's going out.
Should I throw another log on it?
So the next thing I know, I'm jumping out of a plane.
My dad and brother are scared to death Wait, you can jump off a plane, but you can't get off a bus?
Well, I'm an ironic kind of guy.
I like that.
And I like the way you're really interested in what I'm saying.
Well, you're easy to listen to.
And I do think you're interesting.
You're the most interesting cute mountain girl who's ever rescued me.
See?
You do listen.
Thanks for pointing out all this natural beauty of everything around me.
How you doing?
Mr. Feeny.
What are you doing up this late?
Au contraire, Mr. Matthews.
I am up with the sun, ready to make first tracks.
But I'm quite surprised to see you up this early.
Cory.
Lauren.
It's morning.
So, Lauren, I had a nice time talking to you.
So did I. I like you, Cory.
Yeah, I like you, too.
But we can't do anything about that, can we?
No.
So, guess I should get ready for work.
Well, I'm ready.
Lauren.
We could be friends.
Hey, your ankle's better.
So I guess you'll be skiing today.
Yeah, that's what I came up here for.
Yeah.
I mean, you wouldn't want to stay inside on your last day.
Have fun.
Don't get hurt.
All night?
Nothing happened, Shawn.
We were just talking.
All night?
Good morning, Cory.
How's your ankle feeling?
It's confused.
What?
I mean, it's bothering me, and it's not bothering me.
I don't know what I should do.
If it's bothering you at all, then you should stay off of it.
Yeah, it's bothering me.
Hey!
I saw you with Lauren.
Your ankle's fine.
You lied to Topanga!
I didn't do anything.
You lied to Topanga!
Shawn, all we did was talk.
All you did was talk?
That's it.
No kissy?
Just talky.
Well, are you gonna tell Topanga?
Why would I tell Topanga about something that's not gonna turn into anything?
If it's not gonna turn into anything, then how come you lied about your ankle?
Listen, I've been with Topanga forever.
Okay?
I don't want to have feelings for another girl.
I can't have feelings for another girl.
Lauren will understand that.
Sure, she will.
Everything's fine.
You don't have a problem at all.
Read the Bible!
Yes, sir, may I help you?
I don't wanna have feelings for another girl.
Neither do I. Why aren't you skiing?
I can't have feelings for another girl.
You understand that, right?
I understand it.
And I respect it.
Why aren't you skiing?
Because I need to make sure we understand that last night didn't mean anything.
Does Topanga know you're here?
No, I told her my ankle was still sore.
So you lied to your girlfriend because last night didn't mean anything.
I lied to my girlfriend because I don't want to hurt her.
And I don't know what last night meant.
Cory, you know in that game, they ask, "If you could describe your perfect mate, who would it be"?
Well, I've always known the answer.
Please don't do this.
It wasn't you.
Oh!
I'm trying to say, I wasn't expecting you.
But sometimes people take you by surprise.
Surprise.
Good.
Well, I'm glad we cleared this up.
You kissed her?
What am I gonna do?
Well, I'll tell you what you're not gonna do, Cory.
You are not gonna tell Topanga, you understand me?
I know women, Cor, and I know she'll forgive you for talking to Lauren, and I know she'll even forgive you for lying to her because you never have before, but she will never ever forgive you for kissing another girl.
Don't tell her, Cor.
Don't.
I want this whole thing never to have happened.
Well, it's too late for that.
Hi, Topanga.
Hi, Cory.
You're back on your feet.
Do you wanna ski a few runs with me before they close the ski lifts?
We need to talk.
Okay.
Honesty's the most important thing in a relationship.
And you mean everything to me, so I want to be honest with you.
I lied about my ankle today so I could stay at the lodge.
Why would you want to stay at the lodge?
Well, I met an interesting person that I liked talking to.
Lauren.
You lied to me so you can spend time with another girl?
See, after you went to bed last night, we spent the whole night talking.
And this morning I told her it didn't mean anything.
You lied to me?
I'm sorry.
I'd rather break my ankle into I'm never gonna lie to you again.
Cory, it's okay for you to talk to an interesting person, but it's not okay that you lied to me.
I know.
I shouldn't lie to someone I love more than anything.
I love you, too.
Did anything else happen between you?
What?
I'm sorry.
What?
Did anything else happen between you?
No.
Nothing.
Be sure and tell your friends about the Mount Sun Lodge!
They make me say that.
It was nice meeting you, Lauren.
Listen, I don't want to cause any trouble between you and your girlfriend.
You don't have to apologize.
I wasn't going to.
You ran off before we could talk.
I said I like you, Cory, and I meant it.
I don't want to ignore that.
Well, it's all in this letter.
I hope you'll read it.
Are we ready?
I gotta go.
Hi.
Hi.
Can I sit next to you on the bus?
You better.
Let's talk all the way home, okay?
I'd love that.
Good.
I'll just put this stuff on the bus.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Okay, what's with you?
Feeny asked 20 questions, and you only answered 12.
This fell out of Cory's bag at the ski lodge.
I think it might be from Lauren.
"Talk-all-night" Lauren?
That girl should have a radio show.
What more could she have to say?
I don't know.
I haven't read it.
Yeah, right.
Hey, you did a good job of sealing it back up.
No.
Really, I didn't read it.
It wouldn't be right.
Hello!
And stealing your boyfriend is?
All they did was talk.
Ooh, there's a new saint in town, Saint Topanga of the deep.
Deep denial.
Okay.
You say "denial," I say "trust.
" Whoops!
Look at that.
It opened.
No!
No!
I don't want anything to change my relationship with Cory.
I don't want to read that letter.
I want to burn it.
Ooh!
Actually, you don't have to burn it.
This thing's already smoking.
Give me that.
I don't think you should see this.
No.
Please.
Give it to me.
No!
I'm trying to protect you, you short, little white girl.
You're right.
I don't want to read that letter.
Oh, no.
I get so depressed around Valentine's Day.
What's depressing about Valentine's Day, Shawn, especially when you have a girlfriend to spend it with?
First of all, I have to remember it.
It's not like Christmas, when you have all month to think about it.
I'm still cleaning up after Groundhog Day, and I turn around, and the mailman gives me a valentine.
From who?
From the mailman.
And of course, I didn't get him anything, and I can't really tell him it's in the mail.
Okay, Shawn, forget the mailman.
But what about your girlfriend?
This is the first Valentine's Day that's ever meant anything to me, and I'm just afraid I'm gonna screw it up.
Well, you know what?
I'm gonna help you.
Okay?
I am a Valentine's Day veteran, Shawn.
I march in the parade.
What do you and Topanga have planned, the usual perfect romantic evening?
Mmm-hmm.
We have a dinner at Chubbie's.
See, every Valentine's Day, Topanga and I try and recreate our first date so we remember how much we love each other and that nothing can get in the way of that.
Sort of like renewing your vows.
Which is especially important to do in your teen years.
See, Shawn, if you want a perfect relationship, just do what Topanga and I do.
You I want to talk to you!
All right!
I want to talk to you!
When were you planning on telling me about Lauren's letter?
Uh Now.
I was gonna tell you about it now.
Cory, I have never once had to wonder if you were telling me the truth.
You kissed her, and you lied to me about it.
I don't know if I trust you now.
I don't know how we're gonna work that out, Cory.
Oh, no.
Oh, how could you let Topanga read this?
Well, we hit this boring stretch on the bus ride home, so I figured, "Hey, we got some spare time.
"Why not destroy the relationship"?
I thought I'd lost the letter.
Hey, hey, don't jump on me, okay?
I'm not the one who kissed you.
No, but, you know, you are the one who told me to lie about the kiss in the first place.
I'm sorry, Cory.
It was the best thing I could think of at the time.
And I don't see where lying's the issue.
And tell the gym coach I have malaria.
I hear Cory Matthews met some mountain girl on the senior ski trip and Topanga found out.
Yeah?
Well, I hear you're really a guy.
So?
That's what I thought.
Cory and Topanga are history?
I told you that wasn't gonna work out.
You said that Hey, Angela.
Why did Cory lie to Topanga about the kiss and the letter?
How do you possibly know about this?
Just face it, all men are dogs.
Not all men.
Oh, come on.
You got Cujo.
Shawn's not a dog.
He's a great guy.
Yeah.
I thought so, too.
He made a picnic for me in the snow and told me how special I was and that we were always going to be together.
We even made plans for this Valentine's Day.
He made plans with you this Valentine's Day?
He made plans with me, and he said I was his girlfriend.
Which I was, for about a week.
Oh, I got two weeks.
But he gave me a cold.
So, he told you you're gonna spend Valentine's Day together?
That he'd take you somewhere nice.
That you'd be together forever.
We're going to dinner and a movie.
Nothing fancy.
No big deal.
Shawn's incapable of committing to a Valentine's Day date.
He knows how important it is to a relationship.
He'll back out.
Because he doesn't know how to be a boyfriend.
He says things he thinks we want to hear, but he doesn't mean them.
I think he should pay.
I said, "No comment," you little Jimmy Olsen freak.
And please, no more pictures.
Hi, Topanga.
You poor thing.
Look, I know it's early, but whenever you're ready, my brother's face is really clearing up.
Are you two vultures finished?
Look, what's going on between me and Cory is going on between me and Cory.
Okay?
That's not a quote, Ira!
Look, ladies, thanks for your concern, but I think I know Shawn better than all of you.
And I trust him.
She thinks she knows him, huh?
Hey.
I can't believe what's going on between Cory and Topanga.
I know.
Like, whose idea was that to lie to her?
Well, it was the best thing I could think of at the time.
What?
I was trying to protect them.
Would you lie to me?
No.
You said that a little fast.
Well, I wouldn't.
Look, I would never lie to you, okay?
I would never disappoint you.
We still on for tonight?
Yeah.
In fact, I'm gonna take you to someplace nice, and I'm gonna surprise you with candy and flowers.
Shawn, that's great, but I don't care as much about candy and flowers as much as us being together.
She's buying it.
Didn't we?
I wish there was a way to show Angela what Shawn's really like before she gets hurt.
Maybe there is.
You know what?
I think Shawn Hunter's finally gonna keep a date for Valentine's Day.
You know, this whole Valentine's Day thing is one big scam.
The greeting card companies, the candy stores all trying to rip off the innocent consumer.
No date, huh?
I am so lonely.
Let me tell you something, my friend.
You rejoice in your solitude and kiss it on the lips.
Why would I do that?
Because having a date on Valentine's Day is like an IOU for the rest of your life.
Yeah.
You know, women take this day way too seriously.
Today is the one day women turn their men into love puppets.
Got a hot date there, Pinocchio?
I got her candy.
Oh, never give a chick candy, man.
Slip her 20 bucks instead.
She'll appreciate the cash.
Maybe she'll buy you something nice with it.
What is this, nougat?
That's good!
So my little brother likes somebody enough to go on a Valentine's Day date, huh?
Yeah.
You know, usually I find a reason not to show up, but think I'm gonna make it to this one.
You're really gonna do this, huh?
Yeah, I really am.
Love?
We got love?
He's dressed very nicely.
Hey, does she feel the same way about you?
Yeah, I guess she does.
"I can't stop thinking about you.
"Here's to our night of romance.
"Meet me at the boathouse.
Love, Angela.
" Excuse me, boys, but I have a date that I want to keep.
Next Valentine's Day?
Dates.
Definitely dates.
Yeah.
Angela?
Your valentine's here.
Your valentine?
Shawn?
Women.
Can't be on time to their own romantic rendezvous.
Men.
Don't know a trap set by their ex-girlfriends when they walk right into it.
Jennifer.
What What are you doing here?
Oh, we're just keeping our dates for Valentine's Day, remember?
Hey, Shawn.
Dana.
Wow!
Your tastes have changed since our last date when we went skating.
Yeah.
A lot of things have changed, Shawn, but not you.
Even though Angela thinks you have.
But we know better.
Libby.
How you doing?
What What's the tape for, I wonder?
This is the one time your sweet-talking isn't gonna get you out of anything.
We're not gonna let you hurt Angela.
Why would I hurt Angela?
I love her.
You guys are hurting Angela by not letting me go.
Why are you doing this?
Oh, you'll have your time to speak, Shawn.
But not now.
Now, you're in our court.
Let the trial of Shawn Hunter begin.
Happy Valentine's Day.
Hi.
Melissa?
Jack Hunter.
Happy Valentine's Day.
I know you probably don't remember me Oh, you do?
She was the hottest girl in third grade, man.
So, Melissa, look, I know this is short notice, but if you don't have a date tonight Oh, that's Sister Melissa now?
Are you still hot?
Hello?
You just gave up too easy.
Hey, guys.
Oh!
Hey, Angela.
What are you doing here?
Meeting Shawn for our Valentine's date.
Here?
Here.
He's here, isn't he?
You said you were gonna call, and you never did.
One night of kissing and you were out the door.
Did you think that didn't mean anything to me?
Ow!
It was kissing.
I mean I didn't know it was supposed to mean anything.
I say we move right to the penalty phase.
Wait, wait, wait a minute.
Can I say something here?
We should let him talk.
Thank you, Dana.
You were always the reasonable one.
Well, what was I?
You were the Look, I understand what you guys are trying to do here.
You're trying to protect Angela from me.
But you don't have to.
Because I really care about her.
Didn't you really care about me?
Yeah, I did at the time.
And what about me?
Yeah.
I did.
And what about me?
Yeah Look at that.
Shawn broke his date with Angela to be with three girls.
Wait a minute.
He's handcuffed.
That little devil!
I don't think he's enjoying it.
That's his problem.
That's an awful lot of candy for somebody who's already so sweet.
One box is from Henry, and one box is from Jimmy.
I haven't decided which one's my boyfriend yet.
Ooh, we're raising a very fickle woman, honey.
Well, at least somebody got some candy.
Well, I was gonna get you a box, but I know you're watching your weight.
Ooh.
Gee, isn't that an interesting thing I just said?
With the weight thing, and Eric said that maybe you would prefer cash.
So, here.
I happen to have some cash on me.
Ten dozen roses to Miss Topanga Lawrence, please.
I'll call you right back.
Angela.
Hey.
Hi.
Is Shawn here?
Uh Stop it.
He's standing me up, isn't he?
No.
I guess Jennifer was right.
He's just not ready for a serious relationship.
Wait a minute.
You're doubting your whole relationship over one missed date?
Come on, that's nothing.
Listen, when you're in a relationship, you don't doubt first.
You trust first.
Interesting you say that, considering your current situation.
Well, my current situation is only my current situation.
Topanga?
Hi, Eric.
Shawn did what?
What boathouse?
Yeah.
Angela's right here.
Uh Then he said he wanted to be my boyfriend and only go out with me.
And I believed him.
And you said that you liked me, but you just didn't "love me" like me.
And what did you think of that?
I didn't understand him, actually.
Then when he stopped calling, I understood that.
Thank you.
The prosecution calls Libby Harper.
He came over to my house, and we made out for, like, three hours.
I liked you, Shawn.
And I thought you liked me.
I did.
But people grow apart.
And I had another date that night.
Yeah, with me!
Sorry, Lib.
That's okay.
You're not on trial here.
But he is.
You know what you are.
The only person Shawn Hunter is capable of really liking is Shawn Hunter.
And that little curly-haired guy.
How about a witness for the defense?
Oh, Jack!
Man, am I glad you're here.
Hey, Eric.
What's up?
What do you girls think you're doing?
How come Shawn's getting all this attention?
We're friends of Angela.
We're protecting one of our own.
We don't want her to get hurt like he hurt us, so he's on trial for sins against womanhood.
I gotta go.
Yow!
Look.
Shawn's my brother, okay?
He's a good guy, and any girl'd be lucky to have him.
And what about you?
Eric.
You know me.
Tell her what kind of guy I am so I can get out of here.
You're pretty.
He's a bad, bad man.
Jack, I was supposed to meet Angela over an hour ago.
Help me out here.
I object.
On what grounds?
He doesn't know any better.
He's a man.
A lousy, no-good man, just like the rest of us.
Oh, God, why was I born with this curse?
Please.
It's Valentine's Day.
I made a promise to Angela.
You made the same promise to me, Shawn.
Oh, yeah.
I did.
But, Dana, that was six months ago.
Nobody makes a promise that far in advance that they expect to keep.
Really?
How far in advance can you make a promise?
A week?
A day?
You promised Angela that you'd never disappoint her.
How long will it be till you hurt Angela like you hurt us?
A week?
A day?
I don't know.
What do you three witches think you're doing?
Angela!
We're doing you a favor, Angela.
You just don't know it.
What I do know is Shawn would've been here for our date if it wasn't for you guys.
I tried.
I wanted to be with you more than anything tonight.
The defendant will refrain from using his charm to sway the witness.
And we're not leaving until you admit that you're not boyfriend material.
You know what?
Give the guy a break, okay?
I mean, Shawn's made some mistakes, yeah, but he is learning from them.
I guess you would know about making mistakes, Cory Matthews.
You made the biggest one of all when you lied to Topanga.
I never liked you, did I?
No.
Cory Matthews, Exhibit A. All-around nice guy.
If he can't be trusted, can any man be trusted?
You know what?
We all make mistakes, okay?
But that's all right, because love doesn't require you to be perfect.
But it does require you to forgive.
Why don't you tell that to our surprise witness?
Topanga!
What are you doing here?
They wanted to know if I could ever trust you after what you've done.
I heard what you said and it was beautiful.
Listen, I'm so glad you're here, okay?
I'm so sorry about this whole thing.
Let's just pretend it never happened.
I wish it never happened, too.
Good.
Then let's go to Chubbie's, okay?
We'll pretend it's our first date again.
We'll start all over.
Cory, I don't want to have to start all over.
But I'm just so disappointed in you.
Hey.
Hey.
I want to talk to you.
Shawn, I don't care what these girls think.
But they're right.
I have always wanted to feel for somebody what Cory feels for Topanga.
So I made promises that I couldn't keep.
And I said things that I wanted to feel.
And I kissed you like I loved you.
I'm sorry if I hurt any of you.
I didn't mean to.
But I care about you too much to do that to you.
I want to change our relationship.
Because I think you have to be friends before you can fall in love.
You want to be my friend?
That's where I want to start.
And where do you want to end up?
I don't want to end up saying things that I don't mean.
And I don't want to end up making a promise that I can't keep.
Not to you.
Why not to me?
I don't want to say.
Because you care about me?
I'm not talking.
What are you doing tonight?
Nothing.
You want to hang out?
Yeah.
Good.
Hey, Cor.
You shouldn't be alone.
Why don't you come with us?
No.
You guys go ahead.
I'm gonna go to Chubbie's.
Why?
Why are you gonna go there?
'Cause Topanga's gonna be there.
Okay?
I know her.
She'll be there.
At least, I hope she's there.
That was just so sweet.
Isn't it the best to have friends?
Oh, shut up.
Valentine's Day blows.
But it really doesn't have to.
I mean, what do you guys think about a nice romantic dinner?
No lies, no false promises.
Just a lovely evening with two well-intentioned guys.
Well-intentioned guys.
Is there really such a thing?
Oh!
You've gotta learn to be more trusting.
Let's go.
Hey
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
You and Topanga can't be apart like this.
It's giving me a heart attack.
Shawn, I didn't even do anything, okay?
I meet one other girl, I talk to her, and I get a little thank you note.
Cory, she wrote you the most passionate love letter I've ever read that didn't start with "Dear Shawn.
" I can't control what another person puts in a letter, Shawn.
Now, Topanga knows that.
Okay, okay, it's been raining for seven days.
How do you explain that?
Warm air meets a low-pressure system?
Wrong.
It's raining because God is crying.
And he's crying because he created you and Topanga to be the role model of the perfect couple for the entire universe.
You know, Shawn, Topanga's angry at me.
What are you so upset about?
Because, you know, someday, after a slew of meaningless relationships, it's possible that I'm gonna want what you have.
Now, how can I want what you have if you don't have it?
I want you to still have it.
Shawn, I didn't do anything, okay.
I fell off a bus.
I sat on a couch.
I talked to some girl.
I didn't write that letter, and she kissed me.
Cory, a guy can do no better than Topanga Lawrence.
Yeah, I know that.
Then be at Chubbie's after school.
He lied to me.
He lied to me about staying up all night with Lauren.
Strike one.
All they did was talk.
He lied to me about kissing her.
Strike two.
All they did was talk and kiss.
I read the letter, Shawn.
She's crazy about him.
Because she knows what you know, Topanga.
A girl can do no better than Cory Matthews.
You're a good friend, Shawn, and I think it's great what you're trying to do for Cory, but I'm not just doing this for Cory.
What?
You're my friend, Topanga.
You're one of the two best people I know.
Who's first?
He is.
But you and me are the two best things in his life.
Who's first?
You are.
Please let him tell you that some girl named Lauren came on to him, and it was flattering, but it didn't mean anything.
And he's never gonna see her again for the rest of his life.
Talk to him, Topanga.
Where?
Chubbie's.
After school.
Will you be there?
You know, I'm actually a little bit nervous.
Don't be nervous.
She's about to forgive you, Cory.
Nothing can go wrong.
Yeah, but it's kind of like a first date, you know?
I mean, I wonder what she'll be wearing.
Hi.
Oh, my God.
She's wearing a Lauren costume.
Cory.
What are you doing here?
I just spent four hours on the bus, Cory.
Can you give me something better than, "What are you doing here"?
You have to leave.
Sweet talker.
No wonder I couldn't stop thinking about you.
Lauren, listen, I'm meeting someone here, and really, I don't mean to be rude, but Get out!
Get out!
You, get out!
Cory, if you want me to leave, I will.
But I needed to see you.
You never answered my letter, and I needed to know if what we had was just because of the fireplace and the mountains and the sky.
All right, listen, toots.
May I call you toots?
What you had was, "You, get out"!
Lauren, I'm meeting Topanga here, okay?
And I don't want her to see us together.
Can't always get what you want.
Strike three.
Topanga, I'm sorry, it didn't mean what it sounded like, okay?
I had no idea she was gonna be here.
She came all this way to talk to you, and If you feel that you need to talk to her, then that's what you should do.
It's a trap.
Take Topanga and go.
Trap.
I couldn't be with somebody who wasn't 100% sure.
So if you need some time, then, yeah, take it.
And the world as we know it has ended.
Oh, Eric.
I just had a phone call.
I need to ask you a favor.
Oh, no problem.
Just give me your keys.
I'll mow your lawn and water those ugly little plants.
You don't think I'd actually let you inside my house.
No.
No, what I'm talking about is a lot more important than watering plants.
Oh, look, Mr. Feeny, don't get my hopes up that you're actually gonna trust me with something, okay?
I'll wash your car.
No biggie.
My citizenship class is starting a series of practice tests this week.
Unfortunately, I have a scheduling conflict.
I need you to proctor.
Me?
Proctor?
Proctor Matthews.
You know what proctor is?
Yeah.
It's a tushie doctor.
I'm not gonna do that!
Maybe you better just wash the car.
No, Mr. Feeny.
No problem.
What do you want me to do?
Well, you see, this is a class of people from foreign countries who want to become American citizens.
All I want you to do, all Is pass out the pencils and tests and gather them at the end of the class.
You do nothing else.
Do you understand?
All right, everybody hold your tests up like this.
Now do this.
There will be no test today.
Throw away the textbooks, throw away the tests.
Throw away the textbooks You're my class now, and for the first time in my life, I'm the smartest guy in the room.
Can we all just take a second and let that sink in?
In my country, I was a nuclear physicist.
Yeah, but, see, everybody here starts with a clean slate.
And as your proctologist, I'm gonna show you something.
Please don't pick me.
Pick a card, any card you want.
You know, Topanga practically told me to go out with Lauren.
What did she mean by that?
She's a woman.
She was speaking to you in "womanese.
" Oh, you speak that language?
I'm conversational.
I wouldn't say I was fluent.
What I do know is that you have to look for stuff that's not there.
And believe me, there's a whole lot she was saying that's not there.
What do your parents think?
I haven't told them yet.
Haven't told us what?
That I agreed to see that girl I met up at the mountains.
Lauren.
Yeah.
Order me not to see her.
Order me.
Cory, nobody loves Topanga as much as we do, but if you think you really like this girl, then you owe it to yourself and to Topanga and Lauren to find out.
You know, a long time ago, when your mom and I were dating, she let me go out with another girl.
Her name was Teresa Lulich.
So, I went out with her just to test my love of your mother.
I never let you go out with any Teresa Lulich.
I would never do that.
We wouldn't be together this very day.
Actually, I'm mixing up a couple of stories here.
Gee!
What are these, peaches?
Where do they go?
Cory, the rest of your life, you're gonna be presented with opportunities and temptations.
And it's how you deal with them that matters.
Yeah.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi, Shawn.
Oh, stop trying to butter me up, Yoko.
I'm Lauren.
I met Cory up at the mountains.
Hi, Teresa.
Nice to meet you.
Are you kidding me?
Hi, Lauren, nice to meet you.
Cory's told us so much about you.
Oh!
What is this?
Oaties.
You know what goes good with Oaties?
Peaches.
You know where they are?
They're right over here.
I told my parents how you took care of me up at the lodge, how, you know, we stayed up and talked all night.
That's why I needed to see you.
I don't think we really finished talking.
I hope it's okay.
Shawn, don't be mad at me.
I would never hurt your friend.
What's she really saying?
She's saying she wouldn't hurt you.
Ready?
Yeah.
Mom, Dad.
Have a good time.
Have a time.
Shawn?
Lauren?
Shawn?
Have him home by midnight.
Not a minute after.
I like her.
I like her.
I like her, too.
So you want to live in a cottage, huh?
Yeah.
A little wood house.
That's all I want.
That's it?
You don't want a big brick house in the suburbs with walk-in closets and a skylight over the Jacuzzi?
Who would want any of that?
Nobody.
No, just, want to be in love with someone and maybe have some kids someday.
Do you want to have kids?
Yeah, but I have to be home by midnight.
No, I do.
So, I'm not the wild and reckless guy you thought I was, huh?
It's not what I'm looking for.
I've met too many of them.
All talk, nothing real.
Slick and boring.
Yeah, Topanga always says the reason that I Sorry.
It's okay.
She's a big part of your life.
Yeah, she is.
It's raining.
Here, let's get inside somewhere.
No, no, no, no.
Let's not.
But I'm not the kind of guy who stands out in the rain without the appropriate outerwear.
Here, let me keep you warm and dry.
So, you got any film you need developed?
I love the rain!
Yeah.
I do, too, now.
You do?
'Cause I got your rain right here.
Good, good.
Tell you what.
You can dry your hair off.
Come here.
You're worried about something, aren't you?
Yeah.
Aren't you having fun with me?
That's what I'm worried about.
I had a good time.
Cory, you're soaking wet.
I went out with Lauren.
We had fun.
I had fun with a girl who isn't Topanga.
You got a tough choice to make here.
We are going to decide this scientifically.
Hand me those jelly beans over there.
First off, personality.
Which girl makes you laugh?
We're not gonna decide the rest of my life with jelly beans, Shawn.
Then who is going to decide the rest of your life, Cory, you?
Okay, but don't use the red ones.
I want to eat those.
Who makes you laugh?
Topanga makes me laugh.
But, you know, Lauren makes me laugh, too.
All right, which girl would you rather have deep conversations with?
Well, I mean, I can talk to Topanga about anything.
But I like talking to Lauren also.
All right.
Honesty.
You can trust her.
Very key.
Very key.
Well, Topanga's the most honest person I've ever met.
Well, that's a double beaner, and I'm gonna use red.
But Lauren has been honest with me, Shawn, from the very beginning.
Okay.
Okay, now I'm gonna ask you a very important question.
Who's got the better You know.
Who's got the perfume going?
Who do you see yourself Oh, you mean Well, there's only one Topanga, and she's got the "Huh-huh-huh" with the "ra-ra" and the "hockity-hockity.
" Oh, yeah.
But there's nothing like being inside Lauren's Jacket.
What?
Just pour the beans.
It's a tie.
You like Lauren as much as you like Topanga, and you can't live without either of them.
Maybe this was a bad idea.
No.
No, this was a good idea.
Shawn, yeah, I like Lauren.
I like spending time with her.
But I can live without her.
I can't live without Topanga.
It's no contest.
All right, Raj, your turn.
What do you got, babe?
I'm lucky enough to have picked an ace.
Ooh!
An ace.
Okay, category is pop culture.
Pop culture.
Pet Detective launched the career of funny movie man Jim Carrey.
Very nice.
Do nothing!
I said all I wanted you to do was nothing.
Just watch them take the test.
Oh, no tests.
Tore them up.
You what?
I understand what you were doing.
You were testing me, to see if I had initiative.
You think I should be a teacher.
No, I don't!
I just wanted you to pass out the test.
And what has Ace Ventura got to do with United States citizenship?
Eric, for the love of God.
Mr. Feeny, if you don't mind, I'm in the middle of teaching a class, okay?
Minh, your turn.
Come on.
I have a king.
Let me guess.
King Kong.
Don King.
Donkey Kong King.
Okay, those were all good answers, weren't they?
Except for the Donkey Kong King.
Look, Mr. Feeny, you can't play.
You're already a citizen, okay?
All right, Minh, you're holding a king.
Category is civil rights.
"I have a dream that my four little children will live in a nation "where they will not be judged by the color of their skin "but by the content of their character.
" Dr. Martin Luther King.
Well, I must say, although unorthodox, I'm very impressed with your teaching methods, Mr. Matthews.
Well, thank you, Mr. Feeny.
That means a lot coming from you.
You know, Mr. Feeny, all of us from different backgrounds are like cards in deck.
Some cards are red, some cards are black, some are kings and queens, and some are sixes and sevens.
But without even one of them, the deck of cards doesn't work, and that's what Mr. Matthews says is America.
Topanga.
Hi.
I'm glad you're here.
Sit, sit.
I want to tell you everything that happened.
Okay, I went out with Lauren, and I'm not gonna lie to you, we had a great time.
Well, Lauren's a nice girl, Cory.
I knew you'd have fun.
Yeah, but I didn't know I was allowed to.
See, when I first met Lauren, she was the first girl besides you that I ever thought I could like.
And that made me feel bad because I thought if I liked another girl, it somehow meant that I liked you less.
I'm sorry you felt bad.
No, no, no.
But it was good that I went through this, because it taught me that liking someone else could never, ever take away from loving you.
And I don't have to be afraid of what I feel about anybody else, because I know that it could never take away from loving you.
And I always will.
And I know that completely now.
You know that now?
Yeah.
Is there anything else you have to tell me?
Love you completely, know that now, always will No, that's it.
So, listen, can you put me in your jacket, because I only want to be in your jacket.
Cory, I can't see you anymore.
What?
Do you have any idea how many guys hit on me?
What are you talking about?
I never needed to test my feelings for you.
I moved away from my parents in Pittsburgh to be close to you.
Ever since we were little kids, I felt like I belonged with you and I would've given you everything, Cory.
Topanga I'm so sorry.
I forgive you.
I forgive you for lying at the lodge, I forgive you for kissing her, and I forgive you for the letter, which I read.
I know how intimately she felt about you.
But that you needed to see her to test how you felt about me I don't forgive you for that, Cory.
No.
No!
You told me to see her, Topanga!
You told me to see how I felt.
And you listened.
Topanga, what's up?
It's gonna be okay.
No.
No, it won't.
"We the People of the United States, "in order to form a more perfect union, "establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility " "Secure the blessings of liberty "to ourselves and our posterity, "do ordain and establish this constitution "for the United States of America.
" "We hold these truths to be self-evident, "that all men are created equal, "and they are endowed by their creator "with certain unalienable rights, "that among these "are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
" I never understood why anybody would want to be a teacher until now.
That's because you're seeing your students succeed and grow right in front of your eyes.
Makes you feel so proud to know you made a difference in somebody's life, doesn't it, Mr. Feeny?
Yes, it does, my boy.
Indeed it does.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Hey, what are you doing in my seat?
Well, the wife and I aren't together anymore, and I figured it would be safer if I had a buffer.
This break-up is now having severe ramifications on me.
Ooh.
Ramifications.
Nice word, Jughead.
You see?
Now Feeny knows I'm in the class.
It's just logistics, Shawn.
Listen, if I sit in that seat, I can still smell her hair, hear her breathe, watch her sweater go up when she raises her hand.
Oh!
Okay, I'll sit here.
But I'm only between you two, okay?
I'm not in the middle of you.
Hey, Topanga, can I borrow your big pencil?
They're not divorced, Kenny.
It's just a trial separation.
Don't think I don't know what "borrow a pencil" means, okay?
Nobody.
Nobody's borrowed more pencils than Shawn Hunter.
Hey, thanks for not getting in the middle of this.
He was just asking for a pencil.
I know what he was asking for, and if he asks again, I'll stab that big pencil through his heart.
You hear me, Kenny?
Huh?
Why is Shawn so obsessed with you two?
I don't know, but he's almost taking it harder than me and Cory.
We'll return to The Young and the Restless right after this word from Feeny.
And here is the word.
Shut up.
Mr. Feeny, I'm sure if you recall the pain of being stabbed in the back by a girlfriend I didn't stab him!
He stabbed me!
Oh, I'd stab myself before I'd stab you.
Kenny, give me that pencil.
I don't have one.
Now, listen.
This class will not be more interested in the romantic goings-on of its students, than it is with whatever the hell I'm teaching.
Matthews, go sit on that side of the room.
Lawrence, you sit on this side.
Right now, let's go!
Mr. Feeny, you can't do that.
You're contributing to the furtherance of their apartness.
I'm trying to teach a class here.
Now, Mr. Hunter, Nebraska Oh, don't try and change the subject.
Quiet!
One more crazy interruption, and all you nuts are going into detention.
Oh, that's it.
You know, I didn't think seniors still got detention.
They do when they act like two-year-olds.
"They do when they act like two-year-olds.
" Mr. Matthews, when one mocks someone, one should wait until they're not looking right at them.
I'm not in my regular seat.
This is detention, people.
That means no talking, moving, or fraternizing for the next hour and a half.
Where are you going, Mr. Feeny?
I am not in detention, Mr. Hunter.
I can do as I please.
And don't, for a moment, think because of my absence from this room, that you're not being watched.
All I wanted was a pencil.
Oh, shut up, Kenny.
You're lucky to even be here.
I don't happen to see it that way.
Where do you think you're going?
Well, if we're going to be in here for over an hour, then I'm going to my locker to get my cheese product.
Can you believe this?
Feeny locked us in.
He can't do that!
It's against the Geneva Detention Convention.
Whoa.
Do you think he works on that look?
Hey, Giggles, we're locked in.
Do you have the key?
Great.
You wanna let us out?
Hey, this is getting scary.
What is going on?
I don't know, but I like it.
Now I don't like it as much.
It's Feeny.
There's blood on the blackboard, Shawn.
I don't think it's 'cause he ran out of chalk.
No, no.
It's fake.
It's all fake.
Feeny's pulling some elaborate hoax.
Why?
Well, why does Feeny do anything?
To teach us something.
What's he trying to teach us?
To pay attention or we die.
You're nuts.
Stop attacking me, okay?
You've given up your right to attack me.
This doesn't make any sense.
It does if you've seen as many horror films as I have.
This is classic.
The locked door, the scary janitor, the bloody warning, and our soon-to-be first victim.
Me?
Why me?
Well, Kenny, it's certainly not going to be any of us.
What are you thinking?
What is this guy doing?
All right.
You're the horror film expert, what's that?
That's the sound of our beating hearts.
It signifies our heightened fear.
And the fact that something horrible is about to walk in that door right now!
Heidi ho!
Who bled on the blackboard?
What are you guys doing here?
Well, Jack and I had the hankering for some hoops.
Miss the smell of the old John Adams locker room, you know.
Did you guys see Feeny out there?
Nope.
Not a soul.
Actually, it was kind of creepy.
Why creepy?
Why's it creepy?
Why'd you say creepy?
Why creepy?
I think it had something to do with that janitor.
I knew it!
See, we were finished playing, went to the locker room to change, and there he was, pushing his squeaky bin, emptying the wastebaskets.
Well, that's not so creepy.
Oh, and there was blood coming out of the showers.
Eric, how was the pressure?
Oh, really good.
Got all the soap out of my hair Blood in the showers?
This is straight out of that horror film classic, Blood in the Showers.
No, this isn't the janitor.
This is the work of a diabolical master villain.
Feeny?
Absolutely, Feeny.
I just feel so bad that Kenny has to be the first to die.
I really wish you'd stop saying that.
So what do you think Feeny's trying to do?
I think that he knows we're too old for detention to scare us like it did when we were little kids, right?
So he's turned this school into a total chamber of horrors.
Dr. Feeny's house of terror!
That doesn't scare me.
Nothing scares me.
And Topanga doesn't belong to your best friend, Cor anymore.
And if I want to borrow a pencil from her, I will.
And what are you gonna do about it?
You put on a little weight since the last time you were scared?
No, no, no.
You scream when the lights go off.
If you scream when the lights come on, it takes away from the first scream.
Now you're just being loud.
We'll always remember he was that tall.
Oh, my gosh, they killed Kenny!
Yeah!
Welcome to John Adams High Where you are gonna die That's right Feeny, Feeny, Feeny, you are so low-budget.
Wake up, Shawn.
This could not be Mr. Feeny.
No, then what?
There really is some psycho killer on the loose?
You'd rather believe that?
Oh, my God!
What?
What?
My basketball's gone, too!
No, it's not.
I've got it.
Oh, good.
Look, I don't care who's behind this.
I'm scared.
Can we please get out of here?
Of course we can't get out of here.
Feeny is the only one with the keys to all the doors.
And they're all locked and chained by now.
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Darn it, he's right!
Why won't you believe me?
It's all so predictable.
Yeah?
Well, what's gonna happen next?
First, there'll be some strange shrouded figure creeping behind us none of us will see.
Then the lights will flicker, and Feeny will pop up and reveal his master plan to us.
Here's a knife, here's a gun They'll be fun for everyone Death is on the menu tonight Mr. Feeny, I have got to hand it to you.
You have really outdone yourself this time.
I mean, killing Kenny, obvious choice.
But the pencil, George!
I mean, that was genius.
I knew it was you all along.
What's the big lesson?
What were you trying to teach us?
Oh, my gosh!
They killed Feeny!
I was wrong.
Feeny's dead.
Feeny's dead.
Mr. Feeny is dead.
Feeny can't die.
How can Feeny die?
He was the first suspect.
It's my fault.
The second I suspected him, I signed his death warrant.
Well, is any one of us safe?
Yeah, virgins.
Virgins never die!
All right.
Thanks for saving me.
I'm dead.
I'm dead.
Well, I'll get as sick as you can get without actually dying.
What about Feeny?
He's dead.
Hey, hey, hey.
Go, Feeny!
Go, Feeny!
Go, Feeny!
Go, Feeny!
I said, go, go, go Feeny.
I said, go, go, go Okay!
Listen.
As happy as I am for Feeny, I am scared to death here.
Okay, what do we do?
Okay, all right, let's calmly recap.
Kenny's dead, Feeny's dead, we're trapped inside with the killer!
So basically, we have to figure out who the killer is.
Yeah, we should split up.
Right away, wrong.
Okay, fine, we'll just stay right here, and we'll all be fine.
Don't say it!
The janitor's the killer.
And that's the end of the janitor.
Oh, stop being crazy.
Yeah, Shawn, you were wrong about Feeny, and you're wrong about this.
You were wrong to break up with Cory.
What does that have to do with anything?
Did any of this happen when you two were together?
No.
You've killed us.
You've killed us all.
Hey, hey, hey, now you're overreacting.
There's only two people that are horribly dead.
That's an acceptable loss.
Oh, my God, it's coming closer.
He's coming.
He's coming for all of us!
Come on, let's get out of here!
Go, go, go, go!
You know, you are really good at that.
Thank you.
So where is he?
He's probably on his way.
I don't think so.
Angela?
Yeah?
You sick of screaming?
Yes.
Then don't look in here.
There's, like, And this.
Oh, me, okay.
Wait a second.
The killer's dead!
We're off the hook!
Up top!
I don't get it, man.
It had to be the janitor.
There's nobody else in here.
Is there?
All right, how do you explain this?
Easy.
The death of the janitor signifies the end of the last of the obvious suspects.
Just like in the cult classic, The Last of the Obvious Suspects.
But that would mean The killer is one of us.
Like in The Killer is One of Us.
Enough already!
Why?
Do we upset you?
Yes!
Upset you enough to kill?
Dun, dun, dun!
I'm done.
Okay, I think we need to face it, everybody.
One of us is a crazy, psychopathic murderer.
The question is which one of us is it?
Look, none of us is a killer.
There has to be somebody else in here and there has to be another way out.
Somebody has to find a way out.
Fine, I'll do it.
I'm the oldest.
Actually, I'm the oldest.
Yeah, but I've lived the longest.
Okay, fine, you can go.
All right, so, you know, what just happened here?
You get to stay out here all by yourself.
Oh, good!
Good luck.
Thanks, man.
Excuse me?
Killer!
Killer!
You're the killer!
And I know you're gonna tell me you're not the killer.
Because you're beautiful, you think I'm gonna believe you, but I'm not!
This is just like that movie, Killer, Killer, You're the Killer.
And I knew you're gonna tell me that I'm not the killer.
I believe you.
See, I'm a new student here, and I was in study hall and I got locked in.
I've been so frightened.
You are very friendly, aren't you?
I'm friendly enough to keep you safe from the bad, bad killer man.
Hi.
Eric Matthews.
And you are?
Jennifer Love Fefferman.
It's such a beautiful name.
Can I call you Feffy?
Everybody does.
She doesn't look like the killer type to me.
Me, neither.
I am, however, less sure about Eric.
Don't assume.
It's always the one you think can't be the killer.
You can hang out with us, Feffy.
Yeah, as long as we all hang out together, we'll all be safe.
I'm sorry, you Yes, girl, I am the screamer around here.
Hello?
Do you like scary movies?
What's your favorite?
Ooh, okay.
Well, I like that one with the hotty-hot-hot from Party of Five.
Neve Campbell?
Duh.
Guys, we can use the phone to help us.
That's a great idea because when we find out who the killer is, we can hit him with this.
Hello?
Oh, hey!
It's the killer.
Uh-huh.
Mmm-hmm.
Ooh.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
All righty.
Bye-bye.
On and on.
What did he say?
Was he mad?
He said what all killers say.
He wants to come here, he wants to kill us.
Wants us to wait right here.
You know, I don't trust this Jennifer Love Fefferman any more than I can throw her.
I know.
We don't know anything about her, do we?
When did this school get a library?
Every day's a new adventure, isn't it?
All right, everybody, as much as this goes against my horror movie instincts, I think we should split up.
That way the killer can't get to us all at once.
You know, I don't understand why anyone would do this to us.
I mean, we're good kids.
Why?
For what reason?
Yeah.
Hey, we're all scared, but you know what?
Don't worry.
We're going to get out of this.
Feffy!
I'll save you!
No, it's too late, but I think I know who the killer is.
Save your breath, Feffy.
There'll be plenty of time for that later.
Eric, I'm dying.
Oh, right!
Okay, then maybe you should tell me now.
I caught a glimpse of the killer just before the books hit me.
The killer is Eric!
Feffy.
Eric!
Oh, he was my friend, my roommate.
I didn't really know her.
He paid half the rent.
Now I can't afford to live in my apartment anymore.
Wait, if I can't afford to live in my apartment anymore, then I don't wanna live.
Wait!
Wait!
Shawn is still your roommate.
Together you can make the rent.
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
Let's go back inside now.
Thanks.
Okay, I know I was wrong before, but I really, really think this guy's the killer.
Why are you doing this to us?
Shawn?
Shawn?
Hey, Shawn.
Cory.
You fell asleep.
Feeny's looking at you like he's going to kill you.
No, he's not the killer.
I am.
What?
Mr. Feeny, you can let everybody else go.
It's not their fault we're in detention.
It's mine.
How do you figure that?
Well, Cory and Topanga aren't together anymore.
Yes, I know.
I, too, read Teen Beat, Mr. Hunter.
And I guess I've been taking it pretty hard.
And I'm sorry I disrupted the class and killed everybody, but I think I know why I did it.
Pray tell.
You guys have been together since before I even knew you.
And if you're not, then I guess I feel like there's nothing I can depend on.
And it really makes me angry that there's nothing I can do to fix that.
Shawn.
You're not responsible for this.
What do you mean?
This isn't your fault.
Something bad happened, Mr. Hunter, but for the very first time, you're not responsible.
How come I feel so bad?
Well, because you're a troubled young man.
I recognize that from the movie, A Troubled Young Man.
You may all go.
It's obvious that you've been punished enough.
The Great Society, Mr. Matthews.
Lyndon Johnson's agenda for his public policy, sir, Mr. Feeny, sir!
Nebraska.
Miss Lawrence.
Gee, I don't know.
You've actually stumped me, sir, Mr. Feeny, sir!
Nebraska, Mr. Hunter.
The only state with a unicameral legislature, sir, Mr. Feeny, sir!
Pythagorean theorem, Miss Moore.
A squared plus B squared equals C squared, sir, Mr. Feeny, sir!
Actually, I've written a thesis which disputes that theory, and when I accept my Fields Medal for mathematics, I will be sure to thank you, sir, Mr. Feeny, sir.
Come on, everyone, let's give a hand for sir, Mr. Feeny, sir!
Nebraska, Mr. Hunter.
Nebraska!
That's the 75th state.
Major export, tortillas.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Well, there's I'll never have back.
Just when I think Feeny's class can't get any more boring, feudalism.
I'm beyond bored.
I'm angry.
Feudalism?
Uh-huh.
It's okay.
Have a nice weekend, Topanga.
You, too, Cory.
Shawn, did you hear how she said, "You, too, Cory"?
I mean, there was coldness there.
There was not.
Nonsense!
I could practically see her breath.
Shawn, why isn't she suffering as much as I am?
Cory, she's suffering.
She's just doing it with something you know nothing about.
Feudalism?
No.
Dignity.
Topanga's handling this breakup with dignity.
While you, Norton, are a train wreck.
I'm dignified.
You burst into tears every three, two, one Stop exaggerating!
Cory!
Who carries these things around?
What did you do?
Dig up your grandfather and pick his pocket?
It's Grandpa Poppy.
He always had seeds in his teeth.
And that's why we called him Poppy.
Ugh!
You're depressing.
You're depressing to be around.
That's why you're not invited to Kimberly Sussman's party tonight.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Kimberly Sussman's having a party tonight?
Yeah.
To celebrate her new nose.
Like, the whole world's going.
I'm sure if I wasn't invited, Shawn, it's probably due to some tremendous oversight.
Does, "7:30 sharp.
"And whatever you do, don't tell Cory," sound like an oversight?
The word's out on you, man.
Nobody wants to be around Cory, the downer.
Three, two, one Including you?
I'm getting there.
Shawn, listen, you think I like myself like this.
I don't.
Okay, I don't blame everyone for not wanting to be around me.
I don't want to be around me either.
I'm done with me.
So, now that you're going out with Shawn, does this mean that I can't dance with him tonight?
You can dance with him all you want, Kimberly, but he'll be going home with me.
What are you doing here?
I'm crashing.
Crashing the party.
Get out!
Say that again?
Get out!
You know who you look like, don't you?
Bridget Fonda.
Get out.
No, I'm serious.
I mean, your old nose, it was fine, but now it's La Femme Nikita, baby.
Look, as long as you're here, why don't you stay?
I think Topanga's coming.
Who?
I'm sorry, but right now I can't see anybody past Kimberly Sussman Fonda.
Cory.
So they got Hunter kidnapped and handcuffed to a pole, and I have to step in and save Shawn's butt because I have a way with women, as you can probably tell by the fact that I've never been more available in my life.
Tickets go on sale at the box office.
Okay, who are you?
And what have you done with Cory the mope?
Shawnie, it's me.
Now, if you'll excuse me, Cory's got that groove thing going.
Cory.
Hey.
The ex-other-half- of-my-heart-and-soul.
How's the family?
Good.
Cory You look really Uh, not very cool.
Thanks.
That's what I'm going for.
See, they told me to relax and have a good time, that's what I'm trying to do.
Okay, well, I'm not gonna stay very long.
Stay as long as you like.
Mmm-hmm.
He's been like this since he got here.
I've got to say, he's the life of the party.
So, are you and Cory officially broken up?
Because I think he's really cute.
Cory's free to do whatever he wants.
So are you.
Angela, I'll talk to you later.
Sounds like a yes to me.
You make one move on my best friend's man, and that new nose is gonna look like your old nose.
Okay?
Hey!
I didn't know you were gonna be here.
But since you're the most exciting person here, I propose a toast.
To us.
Cory, open up!
It's Shawn, my sidekick.
Hello.
You've been in here for, like, an hour and a half.
Are they asking for me?
Topanga left.
She did?
That's too bad.
I was gonna dance with her.
Is that yours?
This was given to me when I stole it from my father.
You want?
Wait a minute.
Cory is the one holding the bottle.
What's wrong with this picture?
Because you said that no one wants to be around Cory the downer, so now I'm not Cory the downer.
You want a drink?
I told you to have fun, not put away a pint of whiskey.
I am having a good time, and I want you to have a good time, too.
So drink.
I don't need that.
What's it taste like?
It's the foulest tasting stuff I've ever had.
Here.
Ugh!
Why would I want to do this?
'Cause your goody-goody friend Cory did it, and you will not be able to live with yourself unless you do it, too.
I'm not falling for that peer-pressure crap.
Oh!
Yikes!
I know, and yet, such a small price to pay for its magical powers.
Ah!
Ugh!
You know, I just can't understand why they don't sell this stuff to kids.
I mean This will forever be remembered as the night we peed on a police car.
Pretty unbelievable, huh?
You know, Shawn, normally I can't go when another guy's standing right next to me.
What a perfect target.
I mean, I bet you that's why they put those numbers on the roof.
I can't think of any other reason.
Well, here is to squad car Oh, no, no, no.
No.
No.
No.
You ain't gonna finish that.
Ah!
Well, the party is over.
Gravity.
Hey.
Hey.
I was gonna put flowers in that and present to Armanga as a token of my steam.
Wait a minute, Cory.
What?
You just called her Armanga.
No, not our Manga.
My Manga.
No luck, huh?
Those things never pay off.
So why do you play?
I like losing.
Well, hey, hey, hey.
How'd you like a chance to lose five more times?
Wait, five lottery tickets is only five bucks.
That's a $10.
You buy yourself five lottery tickets, and you buy us a six-pack with the change.
No, if I buy beer for a minor, I can get arrested.
You a cop?
Do we look like cops?
Do I?
You know what, Shawnie?
I always thought that Topanga was the one person I could never live without.
But she's gone, and you're here, and I'm alive.
So it must be you.
I'd take a bullet for you.
Shawnie, I love you.
Yeah.
I love you, too, Cory.
And I'm not ashamed.
Now I'm ashamed.
It's okay.
It's okay.
My brother's also chosen an alternative lifestyle.
Let's keep in touch.
You know what I can't get over?
When I left the house, I was almost half-crocked, and my dad didn't notice a thing.
That's what happens when you get up there in years.
You know, you start to lose your edge.
Okay, wait, wait.
This is a toast.
To the best friend in the whole world on the best night ever.
Oh, no.
It's Sipowicz.
Stand very still, and we won't get in trouble.
Why does that number look so familiar?
Sit down.
So, how's it feel to put one over on your parents?
You feel good?
No.
I cannot believe that my kid stole liquor from my cabinet, like Well, like somebody else's kid!
Have they been charged with anything?
Are they gonna have a record?
No, the charges were dropped, because they are juveniles and there was no prior arrest.
Cory, this isn't you.
No, of course it isn't!
Somebody influenced him, didn't someone?
Alan.
No, Dad, okay?
You're completely wrong.
I did this completely on my own.
Come on.
You're covering up for Shawn, like you always do.
No.
I'm not.
In fact, I'm the one who got him to drink.
No.
No, no, no.
Stop protecting me, Cory.
Yeah, you know how lousy he's been feeling.
Well, he wanted to feel good.
And I showed him how.
Shawn, what are you doing?
I am sick and tired of overlooking the influence you have on my kid.
Alan, that's enough.
Come into the other room.
I want to talk to you.
That's probably a good idea.
Listen, Shawn, why are you taking the rap for me?
Because your dad's right, Cory.
All my life you've had my back.
Just let me take the heat this time.
But I'm the one who got us into trouble.
I'm not in any trouble.
You are.
People expect this from me.
I'm the screw-up.
You're Mr. Teenage America.
Especially in the eyes of your parents.
They've got you on this pedestal.
I'm not going to let you fall off.
Okay.
This is what we think.
First, we feel that you two need some time apart.
Now, this doesn't mean that the friendship is over.
No.
No!
Forget it, Dad, okay?
Forget it.
I'm not doing that.
I'm not giving you the choice.
Cory, you were drinking tonight.
I don't care, Mom!
Dad drinks.
I am slightly over 21.
And when I do drink, I drink responsibly.
And when you are ready to do what I do, then you can get out of this house and get a job!
What if Kimberly's party wasn't within walking distance?
Would you have driven?
I wouldn't drink and drive.
I'm not a moron.
You peed on a cop car.
How smart is that?
Look, I appreciate the lecture, and thanks for coming to the station to pick me up, but you're not my parents.
And, yeah, I'll just stay away from Cory if that's what's gonna put everything back to normal.
Normal.
You know I just broke up with someone that I've spent my entire life with.
I don't have a heart anymore.
I've lost my life.
So I went up to your liquor cabinet and I took a bottle of whiskey, and I made Shawn drink, because I didn't want to be alone.
Shawn Forget it.
No.
I was worried about my kid, and I said some things that I shouldn't have.
That's okay.
It is not okay.
And I apologize.
No more drinking?
Yeah.
No more drinking.
Topanga, listen.
About Friday night Cory, you don't need to apologize to me.
No, there was a reason I was acting so strange.
I don't really care.
You don't?
No.
Okay.
It's okay with you that I don't care?
No!
Class, as we continue our study of feudalism, I would like to focus today on the life of the serf.
Mr. Hunter?
I don't wanna.
You don't want to what?
Boring.
It's boring!
That's why the whole feudalism thing didn't work out.
They got bored out of their freaking minds!
What?
It's too far.
No, you know, just once, I would like to learn something somewhat relevant to our lives.
Shawn, shut up.
I say this with love.
What's the matter with you?
Nothing.
Now, why don't you stop being so crazy and sit on Cory's lap?
Mr. Hunter, we will discuss your outburst at the end of the class.
Cool, so let the boredom begin.
Mr. Hunter, please leave.
Okay.
But only because you asked me so nicely.
Listen, Mr. Feeny, can I Go, go.
Are you kidding me?
I'm sorry, did you want one?
You get kicked out of class, you fight me all the way home, you puke on my shoes, and you still want another beer?
Why don't you go home, Cory the monitor?
You know what, I I could've sworn we agreed to stop drinking.
Yeah, well, I've been drinking all week, and you haven't noticed a thing.
You've been drinking all week?
Yeah.
See, I'm doing this for you.
You're worried about me, you stop thinking about Topanga.
By the way, you know, she's getting out of school right about now.
Why don't you go across the street from her and cry?
What?
What are you doing?
It's a beer!
What's the big deal here?
We got drunk at a party the other night.
I think he might've liked it a little too much.
Yeah, well, a beer's a big deal for us.
Goody, goody.
Now I get the lecture from the big brother, who I've known all of six months.
You don't have a clue, do you?
About what?
About Dad!
Yeah.
Yeah, Dad used to drink, and then he stopped.
Next?
You know why he stopped drinking?
Because he ran out of money?
You know why my mom left him?
'Cause she went for a guy with more money?
She left him because he was an abusive, ugly drunk.
Don't you ever talk about my dad Shawn!
Shawn!
Stop!
He's my father, too, man!
Alcoholism is in our family, and you shouldn't drink!
Shawn?
After the other night, Shawn, I feel like I can never drink again.
You were drinking?
Yeah.
What do you figure that was about?
I wonder!
You know what, Shawn?
Shut up.
Okay?
We agreed to stop drinking.
I have.
You obviously haven't.
What do you think that's about?
I wonder.
And, by the way, I happen to have been an adorable drunk.
You should have seen me.
I did.
You weren't.
And this isn't about us.
Shawn, it's okay.
Look, we can talk about anything.
If there's a problem, we can figure out what to do.
Nobody's listening to me.
Okay.
I drink this stuff because I like it.
It makes me feel good.
Hello!
Hello!
Is this thing on?
I have no problem.
Okay.
Maybe we don't have to talk about this in front of everybody.
Let's just go out into the hall Don't!
I don't like that you drink.
Call me when you don't.
How did that just happen?
Hi.
I, um I just wanted to let you know that you don't have to worry about me having a drink anymore.
But if you want me to stay away from Cory because of all the other idiot stuff I do, I understand.
Come on in.
You know, I wouldn't want two friends to be kept apart.
When I said that, I was under the influence of alcohol.
You were drunk, too?
No, you were.
And so was Cory, and I didn't like seeing you that way.
Yeah.
That seems to be the general consensus.
So When can Cory come out and play?
Can I, Dad?
Huh?
Huh?
Can I?
What month is it?
It's still March.
Sorry, Shawn.
Maybe next time, you won't be so easily influenced by your rotten friends!
Yeah, well, he's the only one I got.
Angela hasn't called back yet?
No.
She won't return my messages.
I picked a fine time to quit drinking.
Yeah, I've got a lot of apologizing to do.
An apple?
Are you kidding me?
What I did in class yesterday was so out of line.
If you won't accept my apology, then I want you to have this $12.
The only thing of value for me, Mr. Hunter, would be to know that you're all right.
Are you all right?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm all right.
My brother and I, decided to talk to this guy who's gonna help us understand how to deal with this.
Good for you, Shawn.
That's the right thing to do.
Topanga I know you're sorry.
I got the card and the fruit basket.
It was missing an apple, by the way.
Right.
Here.
How you doing?
Hey.
Wanna hang out two weeks from Thursday?
I'll be there.
Good morning, Topanga.
I still love you.
We can't start off the day like that, Cory.
I don't care what you think.
Fine.
Fine!
Hi.
Hi.
I don't like me when I drink, either.
Good.
Because I sure like you when you don't.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Yep, without me, Judy, your pretty little legs wouldn't have a balcony to stand on.
Is it secure?
That baby's as secure as I am.
Why?
What, you don't think I'm secure?
Oh, Dylan, are you okay?
Dylan?
I have no feeling in my arms or my legs!
Oh, great.
Now I've got no Romeo.
Okay!
Who built the balcony?
Okay, in retrospect, it might have been foolish of me to consider paste the nail's silent cousin.
But you live, you learn.
I have 400 people coming, not to mention Mr. Joffrey Menell, the esteemed theater critic from the PennySaver.
What do you suggest I do?
Well, you're really old.
Why don't you retire?
Dylan, are you sure you can't go on?
Clear!
What about just the matinee?
Okay, okay, I'll just get some tights, and I'll take these funny little booties here.
Thanks.
You Romeo?
'Tis to laugh.
'Tis it?
"O my love, "my wife!
"Thou art not conquered "Beauty's ensign yet "Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks, "And death's pale flag has not advanced there.
" Oh, my.
That was exquisite.
Yeah, well, been building that balcony since the first rehearsal.
I can do the whole play.
I can do Lady Capulet, I can do Friar Laurence, I can do Cartman.
I'm not fat.
I'm festively plump.
Please, go and put your tights on.
Okay.
But I do have the part, right?
Mercutio slain!
Fire-eyed fury be my conduct now.
Now, Tybalt, take the villain back again for Mercutio's soul is but a little way above our heads, waiting for thine to keep him company.
Either thou or I, or both must go with him!
Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here shalt with him hence.
This shall determine that.
Prepare to die, Jedi Master.
Bravo, Eric!
Bravo!
I haven't seen such raw talent since I directed Meryl Streep in the 1977 senior class production of The Meryl Streep Show.
Eric, you were amazing.
You know something?
You didn't like me at all before I became Romeo, did you?
But now all of a sudden all these people are applauding for me, and that impresses you.
You know, there's a name for people like you.
Really?
What?
Mrs. Eric Matthews.
I have finally found my niece.
You mean niche.
Probably.
Unbelievable.
These reviews are incredible.
Look, Mom, if you're gonna pay attention to the good reviews, you gotta look at the bad ones.
But there are no bad ones.
I know!
Listen to this.
"Matthews' King Lear rules.
" "Matthews' performance would tame any shrew.
" Promise me you won't let these things go to your head.
I would never.
Oh, look.
Bloomingdale's is having a white sale.
That's not about me!
Come on, Jack!
Cory's gonna be here, like Now.
Get your coat!
Topanga.
What are you doing here?
There's something I want to talk to you about.
Well, actually, we were just on our way out.
I just want to make sure you and I are okay.
Yeah, yeah, we're okay.
Why?
Well, I know since Cory and I broke up, things have been kind of weird between us.
I care about being your friend.
Jack!
What happened to your face?
Apparently she doesn't care about being my friend.
We're on our way to a basketball game.
Now is not the time to be making fun of Jack's face.
No, he's not going anywhere.
Those look like chicken pox.
Do they itch?
No, not really.
However, these are a little irritating.
All right, you've got it.
This is serious.
If you don't take care of these now, you could get really sick.
I don't want to die.
Nobody's dying.
We are going to the game.
That's Cory.
No!
Cory!
Don't come in here!
Okay.
Topanga, what are you doing in there?
She's trying to keep us from going to see the Sixers.
Cory, they have chicken pox!
Run away, or you could catch them!
Save your breath, Topanga.
He is not going to listen to you.
I can't believe how whipped that boy is.
And what do you mean, "They have chicken pox"?
I don't want to die.
You're not going to die.
I'm going to stay here and take care of both of you.
Jack has full-blown chicken pox, and you have half-blown chicken pox.
That is so ridiculous, okay.
If I have chicken pox, where are my dots?
Should I connect them for you?
Oh, man, you're dying worse than I am.
I feel fine.
So I have dots.
That's because it hasn't hit you yet.
When I had it, I had dots, a fever, and I couldn't stand on my own two feet.
At any time during this sickness, did you ever get quiet?
I'll excuse that because I know you're sick.
I am not sick.
I have never felt better.
Or perhaps I have.
Put out your arms now.
There he is!
You know, the real tragedy tonight is that William Shakespeare couldn't be here to see how good you are.
He'll come tomorrow.
I mean, we're here all week.
Unbelievable.
I cannot believe how deeply you feel up there, Eric.
I mean, when you jumped into Ophelia's grave, overcome with emotion, and then wept openly, where did you get your motivation?
They got it right here in the script.
Look.
"Weeps openly.
" I mean, they tell you what to do.
Indeed.
A true thespian.
Eric.
There are some gentlemen here who want to talk to you about your future.
Are they gypsies?
Randolf Dickson.
Juilliard.
What's that?
The most prestigious acting school in the country.
Sir Ralph Kramdensen, RSC.
What's that?
Royal Shakespeare Company.
The most famous theatrical company in the world.
Excuse me.
Matt Frazier, ABC.
What's that?
The American Broadcasting Company, the number one network alphabetically in the world.
How would you like to come to Hollywood and be on television?
Me?
In the TV?
I'm home.
This is where I belong.
Thanks for coming with me, Mr. Feeny.
It would have been so uncool if my parents came.
I'm just here to see that you get settled.
Now, remember, keep both your feet on the ground.
This town is swimming with sharks.
Hey!
Stop attacking my town.
And the people here are real down-to-earth, good kindly folk.
Hey!
Get out of my space!
Hey, there's one of them now.
Hi, nice person.
What do I have to do, call my attorney?
Get out of my space!
Thank you.
You're welcome.
And who might you be, little girl?
I'm not a little girl.
I'm 42.
I just play little girls on TV.
Hello.
Eric.
Are you sure you want to go through with this?
More than anything.
"And as he looked into her dying eyes "and gently cradled her dying head, "he knew they would be together again someday.
" In heaven?
Yes.
Okay, Topanga.
It's very nice.
My brother and I appreciate everything you're doing for us, but we're all better now.
So the next time we get chicken pox, we'll give you a call.
Shawn, stop scratching.
Topanga, I really don't want your help.
Well, I do, Shawn.
Topanga's a good nurse.
My fever's down to malaria level.
I think I can go back to my village now.
He's delirious.
Jack, you can't get off this couch, okay?
Okay.
I don't care what he says, I want you to stay.
Jack Shawn, it's okay.
He doesn't know what he's saying.
It's the fever talking.
That's not right.
He doesn't want to be friends with you because you broke up with Cory.
That means you were never really friends.
No friends.
No friends at all.
Although it seems to be a very perceptive fever, doesn't it?
Hey, Eric!
Hey, come here, buddy.
Meet some of the cast in your new family for the next 100 episodes, I hope, I hope, I hope!
Hey, guys, this is Eric Matthews.
He's going to be playing the role of the long-lost brother.
He's come all the way from Philadelphia to try out, so let's make him feel welcome.
Yeah.
This is our star, Ben Sandwich.
Hey, maybe you've heard of his brother, Bread Sandwich?
Oh, from that show!
Yeah!
Hey, how you doin'?
Listen, let me tell you what this show is not.
This is not Long-lost Brother Gets Acquainted With the Universe, okay?
Okay.
How you doin'?
Sometimes I get shy.
People who aren't shy make me nervous.
Hi!
Oh, no, it's her.
Are you the new guy?
Yeah.
Hi!
Welcome!
Hi.
Have you met Schneider?
Schneider is very shy.
Too close, too close, too close, too close!
Deep down, I'm shy, too.
I'm a wounded bird.
Schneider and me are wounded birds.
Help me!
Why do they need you?
What?
Well, they got me already.
Why do they need you?
Actually, they just told me They got me.
This doesn't make any sense.
If they got me, why do they need you?
Where's my banana?
Is it or is it not 2:15?
Hey, banana boy!
Where's my banana boy?
All right, mango boy.
You're promoted, baby.
Nutty.
Okay.
Mr. Feeny, these people are Mr. Feeny?
You call this a classroom?
There are only nine desks.
Are we supposed to believe there are only 9 students in the whole class?
Well, actually, camera angles will make it appear to be more.
That's diabolical.
All right, everybody, let's show Eric how it's done.
Into costumes.
Come on.
Hey, Schneider, listen.
Maybe you could give me a little something to play off today, okay?
You dead person.
You silent freak.
You know, I am so sick and tired of carrying this show.
Sorry, Mr. Sandwich.
Please don't be upset with me.
I need this job so I can pay for college and get an education.
Education?
Son, listen, this show goes four years, they'll give you an honorary degree.
You'll be Dr. Creepy Weirdo.
Okay, come on, places.
All right.
Three, two, one, action.
Look, Rory, all you have to do is get the keys to your father's car and his credit card I don't know, Shane.
I got a real bad feeling about this one.
You know?
I've never done anything like this before Oh, man!
We're doing this story again?
How many times have we done this, Matt, 100,000?
He's yelling again.
Stop the yelling.
How can I learn so much every week and still be so stupid?
Make him stop!
Make him stop!
Okay, okay, we'll get the writers to fix it.
Come on, Ben, we got the best writers in town.
Yeah, that's all I hear, Matt!
"They're young, they're hip, they're fun.
" Hey!
Do your jobs!
Oh, what's wrong?
Did I hurt your feelings?
Good!
Because you know what this script is?
Poopy!
It's not poopy!
You're poopy!
Oh, boy.
That was a good thing to say.
Let's just watch what happens now.
All right, that's it!
You're fired, all of you!
Get out!
And clean out your cubbies!
Oh, yeah?
Well, you can kiss my diapered butt.
I am too old and too rich.
Mommy, I'm fired again.
Okay, Eric, you're playing Derek, right?
The older, good-looking, not the sharpest knife in the drawer, long-lost brother with a heart of gold.
You think you can play that?
Can do.
You don't mean real gold, right?
Just like that.
Okay?
We ready to roll?
As they say here in Hollywood, "And action.
" Ouchy Mcgouchy, little bro!
If I can't have my lucky tube socks, I shall never pass the astronaut test.
That was great, Eric!
I personally loved it.
Don't do it that way, okay?
Don't do Shakespeare.
Do you.
Don't do Shakespeare?
All I've ever done is Shakespeare.
Do you.
The role is you, Eric.
Do you.
I don't know how to do that.
Just be honest.
Acting is about honesty.
So, all I have to do is just stand up here and just be honest?
That's it.
I can do that.
Sure!
All right.
Hey, let's take it from Ben's line.
And action.
I'm really sorry, Derek, but I washed your lucky tube socks, and, well You're not sorry.
What?
What, all of a sudden the cameras are on you, you're a different person?
What's that all about?
What?
What?
I just saw the way you were acting with the writers over there.
You're just mean.
Methinks you shrunk my socks on purpose.
Like that?
And cut!
Sorry for dragging you out to California, Mr. Feeny.
I had no idea the Windy City would be so cruel.
Eric, just because Mr. Frazier didn't like your performance and we got thrown out of the studio, doesn't mean you weren't good.
I mean, that's just one man's opinion.
Well, what's your opinion?
Same as his.
But what you have to understand is that what comes easily goes just as easily.
I mean, if you want to be an actor badly enough, you have to take classes, study for years, face rejection on a daily basis, and then after 10,000 nos, there might be a glimmer of a chance that someone might say yes.
Next I want to be the heavyweight champion of the world.
Great.
Let's go home.
Okay.
Hey, bud.
Goin' to the grocery store.
You want anything?
No.
Thanks for asking.
You're welcome.
Hey, you're sure there's nothing you need, right?
Like maybe to call up a friend and tell her you're sorry?
I don't know what you're talking about.
You know who I mean.
Come on.
She took care of us.
She was here for a couple of days.
Now she hasn't been around.
You know the one I mean.
Her name rhymes with noshmanga.
It's not my fault, Jack.
This is what happens when you're friends with a couple and they break up.
You're forced to choose sides.
And Cory's my best friend.
Yeah.
I'm sure she realizes that.
Well, yeah, thanks to you.
Hey, look, my temperature was, like, 112.
I didn't know what I was saying.
It's okay.
I'm sure she felt uncomfortable, too.
She's not coming back.
Yeah, you're probably right.
Hey.
There's my favorite nurse.
Thank you.
Look, Shawn.
I know you're in a tough situation.
Cory's your best friend.
You know, he used to tell me how wonderful you were.
But guys always say great things about their girlfriends until they break up.
And that's when the truth comes out.
You know, I've waited 15 years to find out what he really thinks about you.
Do you want to know what he thinks about you now that you're broken up?
Shawn, I don't want to talk about that.
You know, I just came here to tell you that you are an unappreciative little jerk, and if you're so uncomfortable around me that we can't be friends now that I'm not seeing Cory, then maybe we were never really friends at all.
And I want you to tell me that to my face.
Now that you've broken up, he still tells me how wonderful you are.
He's completely brokenhearted over what he's lost.
So am I. Cory's my best friend.
But I want to tell you to your face that if I knew that you and I weren't friends anymore it'd break my heart, too.
You want soup?
Will you feed it to me?
Where are they?
What are you looking for?
I'm supposed to shoot hoops.
I can't find them anywhere.
Can't find what?
My tube socks!
My lucky tube socks.
Have you by any chance seen them anywhere?
Oh, uh You're gonna find this kind of hard to believe, Eric, but, last night for no logical reason that you could possibly think of, I did the wash instead of Mom, and Well This is so funny.
Where are my lucky tube socks?
Well.
I don't think they're so lucky anymore.
That's not the line.
What?
The line was, "Honey, I shrunk the tube socks.
" Oh, I know.
I'm sorry, Will.
I was trying something new.
Oh!
You were just You were trying something new, huh?
Yeah.
Here, why don't you try this, huh?
Is this new?
Does this all look new to you?
Here's new!
Yeah!
I quit!
I'm out of here!
Cory!
Eric!
Guess what!
I blew up another mailbox.
What, Will flip out again?
Yeah, yeah, he did.
What are we gonna do?
I mean, he's gonna be hard to replace.
Yeah, you're right.
Hey, banana boy!
Want to be a star?
Huh?
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
I'm proud of you, Cory.
We have been here for a full minute and you have not once mentioned I'll never forget the first time I saw her, Shawn.
Oh, here we go.
I was over there on the monkey bars.
Crying, because I didn't know how to get down.
But she gave me the courage to jump!
I mean, I tore some cartilage, sure, but I knew, Shawnie, that I had found my playground mate for life.
Topanga!
Mommy!
Stop it!
Stop it, Cory!
You're being ridiculous.
You know we were supposed to go to the museum today?
Oh, God.
No, No.
Topanga was real excited about this new Van Gogh exhibit that was coming to town.
She went without me, didn't she?
No, no, you're there with her right now.
Why don't you tell me the monkey bars story again?
'Cause I wanna see if my head will actually explode!
Oh, I'm a clown to you, huh?
Am I here to amuse you?
Angela went with her.
Well, I was supposed to go with her.
Did you know that I camped out overnight at the Philadelphia Museum of Art to beat the mad rush for tickets?
And in the morning, I was the first guy on line.
Cory, you were the only guy on line.
This city is a cultural vacuum, my friend.
That's why my people settled here.
"Silas Matthews and Ebenezer Hunter, founding fathers.
" I knew I shouldn't have come here.
I was supposed to come here with Cory.
Everything reminds me of him.
Angela, I miss him.
Topanga, you've been waiting forever to see this exhibit.
How could he talk to another girl all night?
How could he kiss her?
He told you it didn't mean anything.
How could it not mean anything?
He kissed another girl.
You don't kiss somebody and have it not mean anything.
I don't understand that.
Should have left him up on those monkey bars.
Oh, please, not the monkey bar story.
Monkey bars.
I was in the sandbox and I saw the cutest little curly-haired boy on the monkey Okay, just forget it.
"Van Gogh's brush strokes and choice of color "emphasize his heightened sense of emotion.
" Yeah.
Ooh!
Mmm, if you wanna talk about emotion, check out the motion coming this way.
Ooh, Lord, I forget my name.
Hi, I'm Nancy or something.
Excuse me, is your name Topanga?
Angela.
My name is Angela.
But I already have a boyfriend, but Oh, her.
Yes, my name is Topanga.
Well, I'm Ricky Ferris.
I'm sure you don't remember me, but I certainly remember you.
Oh, you two know each other.
Sort of.
You changed my life forever when we were about six years old.
I did?
She did?
You ended my little league career.
Hit me with a fast ball so hard right on my left cheek.
I think I still have a mark there, but you don't want to see that.
I do.
You see, you were the one who helped me realize I was more of an artist than an athlete.
Oh, he owes you.
Make him pay.
I'm sorry and I promise never to hit you on the tush with a fast ball ever again.
Well, why don't you make it up to me by seeing the Van Gogh exhibit together?
Oh, I think I should go check out that painting over there, entitled, "Go with him, he's cute.
" I can't believe it's here, under this roof.
The most important painting and the greatest legacy of paintings ever to enrich the world.
Irises?
Well, no, actually, this is my second favorite.
I was talking about Starry Night.
Do you know it?
Oh, I saw it in a book once, but I don't think the book did it justice.
No, it didn't.
See, what you need is somebody who's passionate about it to make you passionate about it, too.
You know anyone like that?
Yeah, I do.
I think this is the most spiritual piece ever painted.
Look at the way he painted the stars.
See how they protect the small town?
It's like these swirling divine lights from God that say, "I will always protect you.
" Well, it says here that Van Gogh found religion around the time he painted this.
Yeah, he found his soul, and he put it on this canvas.
That's what's moving you.
Someone is able to let you see right into his soul.
I'm sorry.
I guess I could talk about this painting all day.
You did.
The museum will be closing shortly.
Oh, my gosh, we talked all day.
No, it's not enough.
What?
What are you doing for dinner tomorrow night?
So, dinner?
We can keep talking about Starry Night or the real stars if you want.
Ricky, look, I've had a really great time talking to you.
I can't believe we talked all day, but I don't know, my heads in a funny place right now.
Topanga, do you plan on eating dinner tomorrow night?
Yes.
So do I. So how's this?
Tomorrow night at 8:00, we'll meet at Thibault de Chattelu's.
That little French cafe?
Right.
Now here's the thing.
We're going to be sitting at the same table.
And I'm going to be sitting across from you.
Now, if you want it to be a date, you look up from your dinner.
If you don't want it to be a date, don't look up.
But if you do look up, I'll be looking back at you.
All right, come out.
You know I couldn't help overhearing.
Should I go out with him or not?
Well, he's gorgeous, cultured, sensitive artist type, wants to take you to a romantic French restaurant.
Should you go out with him?
Hmm, let me think.
Yes!
I don't know.
You don't know what?
He is everything you could want.
He's not Cory.
No, he's not Cory.
So if I go out with him, then Cory and I are really, really finished, aren't we?
I don't see where it would help the relationship, no.
I don't know what to do.
I mean, Ricky and I talked all day.
He knew so much about the paintings.
That's what makes me want to get to know him better.
He's so complex and interesting.
Well, do you think Cory is complex and interesting?
Yeah, but it's different.
Even though I've known Cory all my life, how can I go out with another guy until I know what Cory feels about this painting?
Topanga, this guy swept you off your feet.
You gotta give him a chance.
Maybe one day you won't be telling people that you met the guy you love on the monkey bars, but you met him in front of a masterpiece and he told you how he felt about it, and he swept you off your feet.
I'm not leaving my feet for anybody until I give Cory a chance.
Okay.
What do you see?
Topanga, why'd you bring me here?
I want to know what you feel about this painting.
Well, I don't get what that has to do with anything.
Did something happen here yesterday?
This has nothing to do with what happened yesterday.
This is about you and me right now.
You and I were supposed to come here together and I want to know what would have happened if we did.
Oh, so this is some kind of test.
Right, big test.
Test, the biggest.
Well, forget it, Topanga.
I'm not taking a test.
Listen, you don't reduce our relationship to what you think about me because of what I see in a painting.
That's not important.
What matters is what I see in you and what you see in me.
What I see in you?
Portrait of somebody I thought I knew!
How were you able to spend the whole night talking to some girl, then kiss her the next day and still think you care about me?
Because I did and I do.
You don't!
Or you wouldn't be able to do those things, Cory.
Those things don't just happen for no reason.
Listen.
Don't tell me how I feel about you, okay?
I know how I feel about you.
And she kissed me.
Oh, and you moved away?
What did you do to stop her?
Nothing!
Nothing!
I said, "Kiss me, baby sweetie.
"Kill the relationship with the person I care about more than anything "and make me miserable for the rest of my horrible life.
" That's what I said.
Her kiss meant nothing to me.
And you were right.
Those kind of things do not happen for no reason.
They happen to teach you something.
And I know now that I will never, ever love anybody more than I love you.
What do you see in the painting, Cory?
I see an attack.
An attack?
An attack from another world.
An attack from another world.
All right, let's look again.
What about the relationship between God and man?
Oh, okay, I was about to get there.
Um, see, God, unhappy with how some particular humans treat other particular humans who love them has decided it's the end of the world.
And I think he's right.
God is protecting the people in this little town.
They live their lives and they come out of their houses and they see this sky.
And they know God's protection and love.
And that everything will be all right.
Listen, how do you expect me to see good in anything when I feel so bad in here?
This is just a painting.
This is a masterpiece.
We're a masterpiece.
And I don't care what you think right now.
We're going to be together forever.
And I know that.
But you still need to find that out.
You know where I'll be.
So, anyway, I bought this beret and I grew some hair on my chin here and then I told my parents I wanted to put off college and go to Paris and paint for a year.
How crazy did they go?
No, they thought it'd be a good idea and expand my individuality, but I was just testing them.
Now I really have to go.
I thought I had the only parents like that in the world.
See, my mom got this job in Pittsburgh and we were all set to move and at the last minute, I told them I wasn't going with them.
And they let me stay here and live with my aunt.
What was so important that you wanted to stay here?
Oh, there was this boy.
Oh, so you've been in love.
Yeah.
Yeah, I have.
But I've never been to Paris.
Well, maybe now you'll have an excuse.
I hardly know you.
We've known each other for a whole day and dinner and we're almost done with dessert.
Can I see what you're drawing?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, wow.
They're beautiful.
It's no Van Gogh, but you said you liked irises, so.
You know, I've had a really rough day.
You're making it less rough.
I've been thinking about you ever since the museum.
It's amazing when it can be a day like any other day and without even expecting it, you meet somebody interesting, inspiring, and talk for hours.
What did you say?
Those things don't just happen for no reason.
You're right.
They happen to teach you something.
Yeah.
You're going to kiss me now, aren't you?
Mmm-hmm.
How could you let her go out with another guy?
Let her?
I told her to.
Okay, all right, time out.
Time out, Angela.
You and I, we're doing pretty good, right?
Yeah.
Right, so then we should start to show each other all the different sides of our personalities, right?
Mmm-hmm.
Okay, okay, good, so then this is me really, really mad.
You told her to?
To go out with another guy!
How does that help them get back together?
Now, granted, I may not be the smartest kid in school, but I think it's bad!
All right, this is me really, really practical.
Cory and Topanga have broken up.
They both need to get on with their lives.
They're not broken up!
They're broken up!
They're taking a break!
They're broken up!
They're Broken up!
Hey, he went out with another girl!
She went out with another guy.
Okay, if I went out with another girl tonight, that wouldn't mean that I don't love you and we wouldn't be broken up tomorrow.
Oh, yeah, well, you go out with another girl tonight and you'll be plenty broken tomorrow because I will break you.
They've been together for 15 years, Angela.
These love rules don't apply to them.
Look, all I'm saying is that they're stuck.
They need to see where life takes them.
Otherwise, they're going to be unhappy every day.
I don't want that for my friend.
I don't want that for my friend, either.
Angela, I have to talk to you.
Something happened.
Good or bad?
Amazing.
Absolutely wonderful.
I've never had a kiss that meant more to me in my life.
Ooh.
I'm sorry, Shawn, it's over.
Cor, we gotta talk.
Good afternoon.
I hope everyone enjoyed reading their last Shakespeare play while in high school.
Oh, hey, I didn't know you felt that way about it.
Okay, we'll do one more.
Psych!
Mr. Hunter, perhaps you'll share with us a passage from Antony and Cleopatra.
Maybe something that was meaningful for you.
"Though it be honest, "it is never good to bring bad news.
" Act 2, scene 5.
Interesting passage.
Why did you choose that?
Well, because I want everyone to understand how important it is not to kill the messenger.
Okay, messenger, deliver.
Cor, what I'm about to tell you is going to make you want to kill me.
I'm not going to kill you, Shawn.
It takes too much time to break in a new best friend.
Topanga went out with another guy last night.
I'm sorry.
You know we're the only two guys in the world who still think there's hope for me and Topanga.
You're throwing in the towel?
Yeah, I am.
Okay.
Thank you.
You okay?
Yeah, sure.
It's an interesting feeling though.
What, to know it's over?
To be the only guy in the world who knows it's not.
So you like this guy, huh?
I'm in love with him.
I knew it the minute I kissed him.
Topanga, you're coming off a long relationship and you're vulnerable right now.
And you shouldn't rush into something because of one kiss from some gorgeous, perfect guy.
It was just a kiss, wasn't it?
That's all it took.
Do you know what I felt when he kissed me?
Yeah, I probably do.
Nothing.
What?
I called him today to let him know I can't ever see him again.
You did?
Because I'm in love, Angela.
I don't mean high school "I love you, I love you, too.
" I mean I am in love with Cory Matthews.
And I want to be.
There's nobody else in the world for me, and there never will be.
I'm taken.
Whatcha doing up there?
Well, I was hoping I could sit up here and a beautiful girl would help me down and we'd fall in love for the next 15 years.
It worked once.
I met this guy.
I went back to look at that painting.
We talked all day.
I wanted to see what you saw in it.
We went on a date and he drew me a picture of some flowers.
And I spent a half an hour looking at it.
Trying to understand it.
And then he kissed me.
But I couldn't get it.
Not by myself.
But then I remembered what you said.
That God protects people in their little homes.
That they live their lives, and they come outside and they look up at the sky and they know God's protection and love.
And that everything's going to be okay.
But I'm not like you, Topanga, that I can understand those kind of things so fast.
I need you to help me.
And I'm not like you that I understand that you can kiss somebody and have it not mean anything.
That you can care about somebody so deeply that nothing can change that.
No matter how many times you tried to tell me.
But I understand now.
It was a beautiful painting.
But it's just a painting.
We're real, and you always understood that.
I love you and I will always love you.
Another guy kissed you?
Yeah.
You wanna do something about it?
I felt that, boy.
So we starting over?
Yeah.
What does this make you think of?
And, um, what's this make you think of?
And what about this?
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Previously on Boy Meets World Surprise.
Good.
Well, I'm glad we cleared this up.
Cory, if you want me to leave, I will.
But I needed to see you.
You never answered my letter, and I needed to know if what we had was just because of the fireplace and the mountains and the sky.
Lauren, I'm meeting Topanga here, okay?
And I Really, I don't want her to see us together.
I like Lauren.
I like spending time with her.
But I can live without her.
I can't live without Topanga.
Cory, I can't see you anymore.
What?
You're going to kiss me now, aren't you?
Do you know what I felt when he kissed me?
Yeah, I probably do.
Nothing.
What?
I called him today to let him know I can't ever see him again.
You did?
Because I'm in love, Angela.
I don't mean high school "I love you, I love you, too.
" I mean I am in love with Cory Matthews.
And I want to be.
There's nobody else in the world for me, and there never will be.
I'm taken.
So are we starting over?
Yeah.
Morning, Mr. Feeny.
Wait a minute.
You're sitting together.
You're talking in unison?
Everything's better.
We worked out our differences.
We got back together.
Oh, well, good.
Aw, shucks.
And I'm sure I'm not half as thrilled as Shawn was when you told him the good news.
Oh, no.
I mean, he was even more broken-hearted than you two.
You did tell Shawn, didn't you?
Well, we just got back together last night.
I've had a lot of stuff on my mind.
You should've told Shawn before you told me.
Cory.
It's okay.
I mean, we'll tell him now.
It's not like anybody else knows, right?
Congratulations, you guys.
Oh, my gosh.
Shawn is going to kill me if he finds out he was not the first person to know.
He tried every way he knew how to get us back together.
Okay, listen.
There is only one thing to do.
Ho ho!
Is that the stupid idea train coming 'round the bend?
We have to pretend to still be apart for his sake.
All aboard!
Whoo-whoo!
It is so simple.
We'll set it up so he can reunite us.
It's a great plan!
It's not a great plan.
It's an anti-great plan.
If I may, five words.
Topanga is correct.
That's only three.
You moron.
Okay.
Listen, Topanga, you got to help me.
Help me convince Shawn it's up to him to get us back together.
Why can't we just tell him the truth?
Because look at him.
He bleeds for us.
You and I could make him the happiest guy in the universe.
Oh, this can't possibly come out well.
I can't believe you said that to me, you stunted little whiny Brillo head!
Wow!
Oh, yeah?
Well, you're a short little nasal-voiced blimpo-lipped So and so.
I need more time.
When will this madness end?
Very soon, I hope.
It's all so crazy.
I feel like I'm just clinging to the wreckage.
Well, day 53 of the wreckage.
You kiss my blimpo lips and tell them you're sorry.
Well, I would, but my Brillo head might poke your eyes out.
I'm sorry.
Okay.
Now, let's be mad at each other.
Whoo-whoo!
Your plan is working.
Shawn still thinks you're apart.
I can't believe we were ever apart, my little love dumpling.
With plum sauce.
On the other hand, you both sicken me.
I know this is wrong, but I'm actually starting to enjoy this deceitful little game.
You are?
Really?
Yeah.
I mean, don't you find it sexy, Cory?
Cory and sexy in the same sentence, wow.
I do believe your resolve is weakening, my little kumquat.
Oh, I want to kiss you so bad.
This sneaking around stuff seems to be agreeing with you.
Only if I can be sneaky with you.
On the other hand, you sicken me, too.
And I have serious misgivings about being part of your little Bighorn Where General Custer and his wife Mrs. Custer had a beach house.
Oh, I'm way too involved.
Here he comes.
All set?
All set.
I can't believe how many good years I've wasted on you, Cory Matthews!
But, Topanga, think of everything we've had, everything we've shared.
Sure, we've had some kicks, a few laughs.
Maybe you should've thought about that before you spent time with that skinny-lipped ski bunny.
Ah!
She has a name.
I can't take this anymore.
Shawn!
We need your help.
But it's hopeless.
No, it is not hopeless.
Yes, it is.
Cory, look at how callous and uncaring she is about you.
Look at her again.
Nah, she's like ice.
Hey.
What are these tears, Topanga?
Are Are these the tears of hope?
Maybe a little.
But I just saw him pleading with you to take him back, and you didn't.
That wasn't my heart talking, Shawn.
Cory and I are meant to be together.
I just fear that there's too much damage done for us to put us back together ourselves.
You are our last hope.
Really?
Yeah.
I am?
But I'm sure all you have to do is say so, and he'll come running.
If only it were that easy.
One of the things I love most about Cory is his fierce pride.
That's crazy.
I've known Cory all my life.
He has no pride at all.
Watch this.
Hey, Cor, I think she'll take you back.
She can rot in hell.
Wow.
You know him better than I do.
Say you'll help us.
Perhaps you thought I'd used up all my emotional strength over the last but I have kept just a little right here, in the pumper, for I always knew this day would come, and I am prepared for you, my beloved friends, to squeeze out the last drop of my emotional toothpaste.
I'm telling him.
He's making a speech.
Let him talk.
I will save you two.
Oh, yes.
I will.
What a jerk.
"She can rot in hell"?
It's too much?
Ah, you're actually pretty good at this.
Thank you.
You're actually pretty good at Whoa.
I was actually I was going to say, you're good at field hockey, but you're good at this, too.
Hey, let me ask you something about Cory and Topanga.
Are they still estranged?
That was on my word-a-day calendar.
Good thing you asked me today, too, because if you asked me tomorrow, I would've said "Are they still estranged"?
Hey.
I think they both want to get back together.
They just need me to give them a push in the right You know.
Estranged?
Yeah, estranged.
He's getting worse.
I have been trying to help them all along, but nothing I do works.
Their Their relationship is just more complicated than most.
They're different.
If I figured out why they're different, maybe I could help them.
They're different because they love each other.
Then why did they break up?
I don't know.
I just know I need to help them.
No!
You can't help them today.
Today's estranged day, and so is tomorrow.
You can't get them back together on estranged day.
You got to wait till the day after tomorrow.
Why?
What word is that?
That would be "estranged.
" Hey!
You know, this is the last time I buy anything from All right.
Get in the shed.
I hate this.
Okay, Shawn, how are you going to save our doomed relationship?
It's not doomed.
It's just hopeless.
Good.
Good for both of you.
Admitting there's a problem is always the first step in recovery.
Okay, so what do we do?
Well, the first thing we all have to realize is that this is going to take time.
Time.
Time is it.
And it might not even happen soon.
But, you know, we could wake up tomorrow And be back together!
Shawn, thanks, buddy!
Let's just see what happens tomorrow.
Okay.
So, we all know that this is going to take an enormous amount of time.
Because, well, he kissed another girl and then he went on a date with her.
Yes, thank you, Shawn.
And she was catting around with that good-looking art guy.
Yeah, okay.
And when I was thinking about this on the way over, I realized, yeah, it's possible that they may not belong together.
I mean, the heartless cruelty you inflicted on each other, who does that to each other?
No.
No.
There just may be too much damage done.
Fortunately, I know you better than you know yourselves, and I know that deep down, in your souls, you love each other.
You sure?
Yeah.
That's good.
So we're done?
No.
We're just getting started.
Cory, if there was one thing that you could change about Topanga, what would that be?
I wouldn't change a thing.
Oh, work with me here.
Be brutally honest.
Name one thing that you would change.
Don't think, feel!
But I'm not sure Humor him.
But I wouldn't change anything about you.
Come on, Cory.
We've been broken up for 53 days.
I'm sure you can find a teensy bit of anger and resentment somewhere in you if you dig real deep and think about all the pain I've caused you lately.
Is there, Cory?
Is there some anger that the two of you still need to work out?
You know, I never knew you could be so cold and unforgiving.
And how do you feel about that?
Terrible!
Topanga, I was only No more secrets!
But I was only No more hostility!
Now, what about you, Topanga?
I can't believe what an insensitive jerk you are!
Are you serious?
How do you feel about that, Cory?
Not good.
Why would you say I was cold and unforgiving?
I don't know.
It seemed like the right thing for an insensitive jerk to say.
Well, good!
Okay!
You see, we've got a dialogue going now, and we're on the road to reconciliation, right, guys?
Right?
Aren't we on that road?
Maybe an access road?
We even in the car?
You're right.
I'm cold and unforgiving, so I have no idea how I thought we could've gotten back together.
She really left!
I told you, this is going to be tough.
What?
Well, maybe we're just going to have to accept the fact that you and Topanga aren't going to get back together.
You big, stupid idiot!
That's great!
Let it out.
You don't understand.
We were back together.
We just wanted to make you feel like you had something to do with it.
What?
You mean, you didn't need my help really?
Hey, you'll forgive me if I don't feel bad for you right now.
Well, what kind of stupid thing was it for you to care whether I put you back together or not?
What are you, Humpty Dumpty?
No, no, no, Shawn.
You do not understand.
We told Feeny first, okay?
You would've been very, very upset.
Wait.
Wait a minute.
You told Feeny before you told me?
Yes.
Who cares?
The main thing is you're back together!
But we're not now!
You just broke us up again!
You're just telling me that so I can put you back together again.
I don't like your sick games, Cory the mind bender.
You know, we really should have taken more classes during our senior year.
We have entirely way too much time on our hands.
Okay.
I've gathered you all here today to ask one question.
By a show of hands, how many of us are sick of the Cory-Topanga issue?
Eric, you're the only one not raising your hand.
That's right.
Why is that, Eric?
Because I'm the extension.
You mean exception?
Was today's word "exception"?
No, today's word was "pertinent," but I didn't that was having anything to do with this situation.
All right.
By a show of hands, how many people are tired of Eric?
Cool.
It's ubiquitous.
Look, Shawn, it was really nice of you to stage this little intervention for us, but I really think Cory and I can handle our relationship or non-relationship or whatever it was or is or might be.
I don't think so, Topanga.
You've had your chance.
I'm taking your relationship out of your hands.
I don't think you even understand your relationship.
They love each other.
Then why did they break up?
I don't even know what she's upset about.
You called me cold and unforgiving.
You used to think I was pretty perfect!
You called me an insensitive jerk!
You used to think I was the most considerate guy in the world.
Maybe we've just known each other for too long.
Maybe we don't really belong together anymore.
Or maybe there's just some residual anger keeping you apart.
Residual!
To leave over.
Like if your mom makes a pot roast and you don't finish it, what you have left over is the residual pot roast.
Residual.
You don't know what it's like to live here, man.
You don't.
Then why do you stay?
Because He's my friend.
Because I like him, and no matter what crazy things he says or does, I still like him.
God help me, I still like him.
Oh, hey, come here, man.
Come here.
Oh, look at them.
They're, like, a million miles apart.
I don't think so.
I don't think we ever understood how close they actually are.
What?
Cor, we need you to be back home when Morgan gets back from her art lesson.
Hi, Topanga.
Hi.
Why, you got a big emergency?
Your mother needs me to go shopping with her for bath towels.
Suddenly she can't buy them without me.
Alan, I am perfectly capable of picking out towels by myself.
I just want to make sure I don't pick out something too pink or too fluffy this time.
Buy whatever you want.
Just don't punish me over towels, okay?
Maybe the punishment is because you forgot my mother's birthday.
I didn't forget.
I made a choice.
Oh, that is the most insensitive thing I have ever heard!
Runs in the family.
Fine.
You know, let's just get this over with, so I can get back for the game.
Oh, the precious Phillies.
I'm sure this game will make a difference between, what, fourth or fifth place?
What What did you just say?
I said they stink!
You want to watch baseball, move to Baltimore.
What did you just say?
Give me the keys.
I'm driving.
It's 5:00.
You're a lunatic at rush hour.
Mom, come on.
When you said lunatic It's not the traffic that makes me crazy, dear.
"Oh, oh, look out!
Turn right here, please.
"Oh, you're too close!
Yield"!
And if I'm such a bad driver, why did you marry me?
Dad, when you say why did you marry me I wouldn't have if I had listened to my mother.
Mom, Dad, please.
Listen You know, I am glad that I forgot your mother's birthday, and when June 14th rolls around, I might forget someone else's, too.
Oh, you think it's funny if I forget your birthday, huh?
That's your birthday.
What?
And I know just what I'm going to get you, you big lug.
What?
What are you going to get me?
Come on, give me a hint.
I'm not going to tell.
Give me a hint.
Then it won't be a surprise.
Come on, come on.
Oh, I know.
You're going to give me bath towels.
Right?
Well, maybe I'll tell you in the car.
Okay.
You want to drive?
No, you can drive, but don't listen to the game on the radio, because I want to talk to you.
About what?
About whatever you want.
All right, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Come on, whoa.
Wait a minute.
What just happened here?
You two just said horrible things to each other and then got all lovey-dovey.
Hey, I was going to say that!
How come you say that when I was going to say that?
Who cares who says it as long as it gets said?
Then what are we arguing about?
We sound like them.
Oh, no.
We do.
Why Why do we sound like you?
Because you love each other.
No matter what crazy things he says or does, you still love each other.
Then why did we break up?
Because we're in high school, and you think you're supposed to.
But when two people are really in love, it doesn't matter that there are disagreements sometimes.
It comes with the territory.
And when two people are really in love, they don't break up just 'cause they have a fight.
Love would be pretty dull if you agreed about everything.
Besides, then they'd never get to make up.
When two people are in love, they don't break up just because they fight.
Want to make up now?
Now, that was the most incredible thing I've ever seen.
Thank you.
What, like you had anything to do with it?
Shawn?
Shawn, Cory and I are back together now.
We wanted you to be the first one to know.
Hey, Cory and Topanga are back together.
They are?
Yeah.
And, listen, Shawn, I'm sorry we ever put any pressure on you to get us back together.
You know, I mean, even though you're my best friend, no one could ever do that.
I guess friendship only goes so far.
Morning, boys.
Salutations, my didactic friend.
Excuse me?
Hi.
He said hi.
I know what he said.
Does he know what he said?
Oh, Mr. Feeny, I appreciate your sardonic jocularity.
It's his word-a-day calendar.
It took him some time, but he's finally got it down.
Oh, well, Eric, I salute you.
A good vocabulary is an important asset in life.
Well, thank you, Mr. Feeny.
I'm certain my erudite loquaciousness will be most advantageous, particularly as regards intellectual discourse.
I can see where this is going to get old quick.
Can you?
Snap him out of it.
So, Eric, have you perused the tastefully lascivious Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue?
Tushies for sale!
Cool!
You're a good teacher, Mr. Feeny.
Yeah, well, when you live next door to a house full of psychos
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Oh, so this is it.
The big night.
The biggest night of our lives.
The night we leave as boys and come back men.
Are we talking about the same thing?
I certainly hope so.
Okay.
So, after the prom Romance in the air, you and Angela, you're going to look in each other's eyes Me and Angela?
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe.
What do you think, we sat down and discussed it?
How dorky do you think we are?
What about you and Topanga?
We sat down and discussed it.
And, you know, we weighed the pros and cons.
We made a chart, actually, but, you know, we haven't 'Cause she feels that But I You know So Maybe.
Really?
Topanga said, "Maybe.
" Maybe.
Assuming that everything goes exactly, perfectly right.
So, naturally you're going to do everything in your power To make sure everything goes exactly, perfectly right.
Oh, maybe!
Maybe!
Maybe what?
Oh, it's just guy stuff.
Oh.
"Guy stuff" on prom night.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Sit down.
Listen.
You know, um, your senior prom can be a night to remember without it being a big night.
Cory, I want you to remember that things can happen in a minute that could change your life forever.
You understand me?
Yes, Dad.
Yes, Dad.
All right.
Have a great time.
Wait!
Picture of the boys on prom night.
Have a great time.
All right.
Bye.
How did I do?
Oh, honey, you were great.
I am so proud of you.
Well, thank you.
I'm pregnant.
I'm not kidding.
"I'm not kidding.
" Oh, stop it.
Here.
Oh, well, you know, these things aren't right always.
You know, the first Ah!
Aren't you happy?
Uh, well I don't understand the question.
You're not happy at all.
Oh Hon Honey.
Honey.
So, you and Shawn talked about You know You two After the prom, the big night?
Well, we haven't really talked about it.
It's funny.
I mean, people think he's really cool, but he is so shy.
He has such a hard time discussing it.
I've decided we're not ready until he is ready to at least talk about it.
I've been thinking about it, too.
Cory and I have been through so much.
Now that we know how much we love each other, we've decided that when the time is exactly, perfectly right So, in other words, when you say so.
Yeah.
Wow!
You look You You look Wow!
You look pretty wow yourself.
Thank you.
Shall we?
Go ahead.
We'll catch up.
All right.
We'll be waiting in the limo.
Hi.
Hi.
Listen, I want you to know that there is no one else in the world that I'd rather be with tonight.
Me, too.
And I I just I want everything to go exactly Exactly, perfectly right?
Yeah.
Me, too.
Topanga!
You look radiant.
Howie, what are you doing here?
I'm here to take you to the prom.
My dad's waiting outside in the Plymouth.
What are you talking about?
Don't you remember a few weeks ago when I asked you if you had a date for the prom, and you said, "No," and I said, "Great"?
Don't you remember?
There must've been a misunderstanding.
See, Cory and I are back together.
So, do we or do we not have a date?
No, you do not have a date!
Capisci?
Back in the Plymouth!
I'm sorry, Howie.
Who am I kidding?
Even my mother said it didn't make any sense.
Well You two go.
Have fun.
See you at the reunion.
Howie.
Howie, wait.
Oh, please, no.
Please, no.
Please, no.
Please, no Cory, I feel bad.
Topanga, this is our prom night.
It's his prom night, too.
Yes, but I want everything to go exactly, perfectly right.
If poor Howie is sitting home alone crying his eyes out because of me, I will not feel exactly, perfectly right!
So, Howie So, you want to be our date?
Howie Thanks for being such a good sport about Howie.
Are you kidding?
As long as I'm with you, Topanga, nothing else matters.
Hey, Zamsky!
Look who I'm with!
Hey, look, there's a band!
Oh, wasn't there a band at your prom?
There might've been.
All I can remember is being in the back of the limo with Karen Uzelle.
Barbie Feldman.
You know, I can't even remember my own prom 'cause I was so preoccupied with what might happen after.
Me, too.
Anything happen?
None of your business.
Me neither.
Well, this has been one heck of a prom, and now that it's over You want to go hang out in the back of the limo?
And do what?
I don't know.
Play?
So, pretty soon the prom's going to be over Cory, we just got here.
No, we didn't just get here.
I mean, it's Really, it's taken us 15 years to get here, you know?
I mean, we're not kids anymore, Topanga.
We're adults.
And I think we're ready for an adult relationship.
Fine.
Let's get a hotel room.
Hello.
Hello.
Are you checking in?
Me?
No, no.
You thought I was checking in?
No.
No, I was just admiring your bell here.
What's this made of?
Is this real bell, huh?
No, no.
I was just here to say Hello.
Hello.
Hi.
I'd like a room, please.
All right.
For the reason of Of tiredness and it's been a very long journey.
So, then you want a bed.
Yes!
Uh, but, I mean, it doesn't always have to be a bed.
We could do some dancing first.
So, will you want a king-size bed or two doubles?
What What would you recommend for someone such as me?
Well, have you ever been tired before?
Uh, no, actually.
This is This is my first time ever being tired.
And exactly how tired are you?
Well, let's put it this way.
If I don't get a room real soon, I may fall asleep right here.
Yes.
Well, we wouldn't want that to happen.
So, one room, one bed, one big night.
Yes.
Name?
Why?
I mean, why do you need that?
I just need a name to put in the computer.
Any name.
Any name will do.
Oh, this is silly.
You must go through this all the time.
I'll just I'll give you my real name.
It's Don.
Don Quixote.
That's me.
That's new.
Address?
One, four, one, four.
De La Mancha.
So, Senor Quixote De La Mancha.
I'll just be needing your credit card.
Oh, did I catch you off guard, Senor Quixote?
Credit card.
Mmm-hmm.
Card credito.
Darn.
I've left mi casa without it.
Eric!
Emergency!
Listen!
I need your credit card.
Don't ask me why.
I just need it.
Okay, okay, but it might be maxed out.
I just bought some gum.
Just give me the card!
Well, I Room 702 for the former Senor Quixote and currently Eric Matthews.
But I suppose a man of your ilk has many names.
Thanks, chief.
And now there are no more obstacles to Cory Matthews' big night.
Alan This is so romantic.
We haven't spent the night at a hotel since our prom night.
Well, we may not get a chance to do something like this again for a long time.
Which I couldn't be happier about.
Wait a minute.
I got a great idea.
You check in, then meet me in the lounge, and we'll pretend we don't know each other.
I'll be Shavaughn.
Ooh, you are bad!
Well, I'll see you later, Shavaughn.
Quick, I need a room.
In a hurry.
Oh, the voice of experience.
My wife and I are celebrating.
We're having a baby.
I'm going to be a father.
Which I couldn't be happier about!
Well, congratulations!
Daddy Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Jack!
Jack!
My father just checked into a hotel room with a woman who is not his wife or my mother.
You're crazy.
Your father's happily married.
I just saw it with my own eyes!
Prom fever.
What?
Prom fever.
It makes every man go crazy on prom night.
We can't even remember our own proms 'cause we were so obsessed with what might happen after.
I got to save these kids.
And I got to save my father.
You are the best dancer.
I mean, you could be a professional.
All right, where do you think you're sneaking off to?
The bathroom?
Nice try.
I wasn't born yesterday.
Now get back in there to the only prom you're ever going to have.
I must say, Jack, you're a much better chaperone than I thought you'd be.
No one gets by.
Attaboy.
Good soldier.
Come on, come on, come on.
Yes!
It works!
I did it!
Wait a minute.
What am I forgetting?
The girl.
May I have your attention, please?
It's time to announce your prom king and queen.
Thank you.
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Cory Matthews and Topanga Lawrence!
What a surprise.
Here we go.
Lovely.
You told them?
Come on.
Come on.
All right, where do you think you two are going?
So What do you want to do?
Hello?
Hotel man!
Hi.
I need to know what room Mr. Matthews is in, please.
Pronto.
I'm sorry.
We don't give out that kind of information.
Really?
Well Perhaps my friend Mr. Washington will help change your mind?
Ooh!
So You want to see something I've always wanted to do?
Yeah.
So, what are you going to do?
Hi, there.
Hi, there.
Don't hurt me!
Listen, do you think it's rushing it if I take off my jacket?
Because I won't take off my jacket if you think it's rushing.
Okay, okay.
Come here.
Topanga, I'm stuck.
I'm stuck.
Well, maybe if I unbutton this Wait, I'm pretty sure I'm supposed to see this part.
Topanga, put it back.
It's the vice squad!
Okay!
Don't do this!
The tramp isn't worth it!
Hey, Topanga.
Hi, Cory.
Good, you guys got here first.
Where's Dad?
Eric, do you not see this?
Wait a second.
The guy said this was the Matthews' room.
It is.
Now get out!
It's just you and Topanga?
Yes.
Alone in a hotel room?
Yes.
On prom night?
Yes!
So What you doin'?
Okay, that's enough.
Goodbye, Eric.
Excuse me!
Excuse me!
Not that Mr. Matthews.
The other Mr. Matthews, the cheating Mr. Matthews I used to be proud to call my daddy.
What room is he in?
What room is he in?
What room is he in, huh?
I'm afraid Mr. Washington has received all the information that Mr. Washington is going to get.
Now, if Mr. Franklin were asking Ah.
Well.
Mr. Franklin isn't here, but how about two Mr. Lincolns And a mystery bag?
Maybe it's good.
Maybe it's not.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
Cory?
What?
Do you love me?
I just came to tell you I won't be needing a ride home.
This is Jan from the Hertz Rent-a-Car counter.
She says I resemble her ex-husband Murray.
Quick.
Let's get this over with before Feeny gets here.
You want to get this over with?
Oh, no, no, no!
I didn't mean it like that.
I just mean We don't need any more interruptions, you know?
We've been waiting for everything to be exactly, perfectly right, and now it is, so Maybe we need to be more spontaneous.
Not when we think we have to, like, one day on the way home from the library.
What, do you want a book?
Here!
Here!
Here's a book!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
And it's just starting to get dark, and you hold me because I'm cold.
And we look into each other's eyes and we just know.
Maybe that's when it happens.
When?
When?
When?
Cory, I want to.
When?
That's why we're here.
When?
I'll do whatever you think is right.
When?
I'm just so confused.
Listen, you don't have to be confused, okay?
We're adults now, and adults do not get confused.
You're right.
We're adults.
Let's go.
Ow, my eye!
My eye!
Ow!
Oh, God!
Let me look at your eye No, don't worry about it.
I've got another eye.
Just do everything on my right side.
No, no, no.
You need to get some ice.
No!
Come on Ow!
Gosh!
Cory, get some ice!
I'm not going anywhere, and we have all night.
Okay.
Oh, and bring back a couple of sodas.
I'll be right back, Shavaughn.
Yes!
Honey, I'm back.
Come on out.
Don't be shy, Shavaughn.
Let me see what's behind that door.
Yes!
Honey?
You like?
Thought you can get away with it, didn't you?
How could you do this to my mother?
Uh, well, um Nobody planned this.
I mean, it wasn't something we planned on.
It just kind of happened, you know.
It was like one of those wonderful miracles that's happened to me three times before already.
You don't even live in the house anymore!
It's not like I'm asking you to give up your room.
Wait a second.
You're moving her into the house?
I can't do this anymore.
I got to know who's in there.
Come out!
Now!
Topanga?
Oh, Daddy!
How could you do this to Mom and Cory?
Oh.
I am so out of the loop.
Wait a minute.
What are you guys doing here?
Well We're celebrating!
We were going to tell you tomorrow, but We're having a baby!
You're having a baby?
We're having a baby!
They're having a baby!
I'm going to be an uncle!
So, you're having another kid?
Yes, we are, and we're thrilled about it.
Is this something you planned?
No, Cory, it isn't, you know.
It's like I told you before.
Sometimes things can happen in a minute that will change your life forever.
We're just lucky that for us, it came at a time when we can handle it.
Have a nice night, you two.
Wow.
They trust us.
Boy, this is the biggest night of our lives, huh?
Yeah.
Shall we?
You know, I can't think of anything else I'd rather be doing right now.
Me neither.
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
I have in my hand four envelopes from the office of admissions at the University of Pennbrook.
You robbed our mailboxes!
Hey, it's a federal offense.
I am so proud of you.
I'm in.
I did it!
I'm in!
Oh, well, I I guess not everybody can get in.
But I did.
All right.
Why don't you go now, Cory?
I'm in!
I'm in!
Those idiots let me in!
Whoo!
All right, all right.
Wait, wait, wait.
We got one more to go, and let's not lie.
This is a toughie.
Shawn, no matter what happens, I love you.
I'm ready.
Okay.
Wait list!
All right!
What?
I'm on the wait list, so if they don't get filled up with all the people that they've already accepted, I get in.
But the plan was for all of us to go to school together.
What's the big deal?
We're always gonna be friends.
No, no, no.
Everyone says that.
And then they graduate from high school, and they never see each other again.
Could that happen?
I'm getting you into Pennbrook.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
You're telling me that you got in to New Jersey Turnpike Community College, and you're going to Pennbrook?
That's crazy!
Look, everybody in my family went to Pennbrook.
Topanga.
Could you help us out for a second?
In your opinion, which school is better?
Turnpike or Pennbrook?
Any school's better than Pennbrook.
Pennbrook's yucky.
And what do you know about the Pike?
I would never go there.
And why not?
Well, I hear they have a promiscuity problem.
Really.
Yeah.
Pike girls are way too easy.
They never want a commitment.
You go from girl to girl every day.
And they talk about shallow.
You know, I didn't know any of this.
I gotta go think.
I can't believe I'm helping you do this.
I feel dirty.
No, no, no.
You're not helping me, Topanga.
You're helping Shawn.
Do you really think you can kick people out of Pennbrook to make room for him?
Do you know how crazy you are?
Barry!
Bud.
Did you think about what we talked about?
Oh, think about it, man, I am doing it.
I am turning down Pennbrook and going to Tahiti for six years.
Barry, Pennbrook gave you a full scholarship!
Yeah.
When I told my dad, he took a swing at me.
Cory, I know you want us all to be together, but if it's meant to happen, it will.
Oh, it's meant to happen, Topanga, and if it's not meant to happen, I'll make it meant to happen.
Craig.
Have you heard about today's Army?
I've convinced so many people not to go to Pennbrook that you and I are gonna be the only guys there.
You're exposing my photographs.
Hey, it's dark in here.
That's why it's called a darkroom, college boy.
Come on.
I've only been here three weeks.
You want to get me fired already?
No, listen.
After you graduate from Pennbrook, my friend, your boss is gonna be working for you.
Come on.
I'm just on the waiting list for college, Cor.
You know, I'm not waiting for anything here.
Jonathan's already got me developing my own pictures, you know?
Doin' good.
But then, Shawn, this is just a hobby, okay.
You can take these kind of courses in college.
I might not get in.
You want me to be smart?
I'm smart to consider other options.
What other options?
Cool.
What?
My picture.
It's finished, and it's good.
What do you think?
I think you haven't listened to a thing I've said, Shawn.
Duckies!
Come on, Alan.
If we pick out the wallpaper together, it'll be more fun.
It's not fun.
It's torture.
I've told you a thousand times, woman, I'm no good at this.
Wallpaper is your business.
Duckies!
Well, I'm not doing it without you.
It'll only breed anger and resentment.
Just tell me which one you like best.
Duckies.
Okay.
This one.
No!
Was that duckies?
No.
Garbage.
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Matthews.
Ooh, wallpaper!
Fun!
So!
Two weeks till graduation.
How are you two holding up?
It's exciting, but it's scary.
No, it's not scary.
What's there to be scared about?
Hey, for me it was like jumpin' off a cliff.
Now, you see, duckies are good because not only do they give you that nonthreatening sense of security, but you can feed 'em crackers and you can ride 'em.
See, duckies are the horsies of the ocean.
No.
I mean, they are.
Okay, somebody explain to me about duckies before I hit him with a spoon.
It's wallpaper.
It's adorable.
It's for your room.
For my room?
Duckies rule!
You see, I had duckies when I was growing up.
I I turned out fine.
It's for the baby.
But don't worry.
We won't re-duck-erate till you move out.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Who Who said I'm moving out?
I mean, I will when I go to college, but can we slow down for a second?
I I sort of thought that you guys would keep my room the way it is.
Actually, Cor, for that, I think you have to be unexpectedly killed by a truck or something.
Cory, everything's gonna be okay.
No.
I I know it's gonna be okay.
It's always been okay, Topanga.
I know we're all gonna go to college together.
We're all gonna live here in the same town.
We're all gonna have the same jobs.
We're all gonna take vacations together.
And we're gonna die together and be buried next to each other.
If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go to Chubbie's to be in my regular booth, my regular place, to have the usual.
That's good.
Everything's getting better.
I'm getting happy.
You know, we're all together.
I'm getting a burger.
Everything is good.
Well, you know what else is good.
Tell him the good news, honey.
No more part-time job.
My boss says that after I graduate, he wants me to be his full-time assistant.
That's great, Shawn!
Yeah.
That's the big news?
Tell 'em what else.
This came in the mail today.
Yes!
Is it from Pennbrook?
Yes!
You did it!
You're in!
We are all together forever.
Well, wait.
Let's not get carried away.
We don't know what's in the letter.
No, no, no.
I know what it says because I know what it has to say.
"It is our pleasure to inform you "that due to our latest enrollment figures, "you have been moved off the wait list "and are officially accepted into Pennbrook University.
" Yes!
The enrollment figures.
That was me.
I fixed 'em.
That was me.
Oh, God, I am so proud of you.
Thanks.
She meant Shawn.
What'd he do?
Wow.
I did it.
I actually got into college.
This is a big day.
This is the biggest day, Shawn.
See, Topanga, I told you.
Everything is gonna work out.
Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention for a second?
My best friend, Shawn Hunter I think I'm gonna take the job.
is throwing away his entire life.
I'm just saying I need time to think.
No thinking!
Barry is on his way to Tahiti because of you.
You are going to college!
You're not my father, Cory.
If I was your father, Shawn, I'd spank you!
Because that's what you deserve!
A big spanking!
Now, take down your pants!
Topanga has some news.
Right, Topanga?
This is probably a bad time.
Topanga got a letter from Yale.
If you don't go to Pennbrook, we are finished.
Don't worry, honey.
I don't even know if Yale accepted me yet.
I was talking to Shawn.
What are you talking about?
Go ahead.
Open it.
I applied to Yale when Cory and I broke up.
You know, you have a chance to have a real future here.
Not because I really wanted to go.
I just wanted to see if I could get in.
To get the kind of education where you do not have to talk about exhaust manifolds for the rest of your life.
'Cause, you know, with my GPA being so high and my boards being so, well, high You deserve more, Shawn, okay?
Give yourself a chance.
Give me that.
Here's your food.
Not hungry.
Not my problem.
Still have to pay.
Shawn.
I need time to think, Cor.
You made the wait list, kid.
Nice going.
I think I'll give the check to You.
Gee.
I really thought I'd get in.
Cory, I feel awful.
You feel awful?
About what?
Not getting into Yale.
Yale?
Shawn could never get into Yale.
I mean, you could hardly get into Yale.
What?
What is the most important thing in a young man's life?
Education.
And what is Shawn about to do?
Stop his education.
And it's your job as Shawn's older brother to what?
Fix this?
Why?
Because he knows all your tricks and he's sick and tired of listening to you.
Now, go get him.
Okay.
What do we got?
You've got the Nikon loaded with Tri-X, and the Hasselblad's ready for the close-ups.
Mmm.
Perfect, Shawn.
You're learning fast.
Keep this up, I'm gonna be working for you.
I'll get to you in a second.
The most important thing in a young man's life is education.
Now, as Shawn's older brother, I'm not gonna stand by and watch him throw his life away.
I appreciate what you've done for him, but he's young and impressionable, and I'm not.
Have you ever modeled?
No.
Why do you ask?
Yes!
Yes!
Good!
Good!
Good!
Oh!
Now.
Wistful.
Oh.
You have done this.
You have done this before!
Perfect!
Thanks for bringing me this guy.
He's gold.
Do you do angst?
Excellent!
Shawn, go see if Terri's ready.
Right away.
Shawn.
Shawn.
Yeah.
Let me ask you something.
As your friend As your best friend, just tell me why you would consider giving up everything for this.
How do I look, Shawn?
Uh Come here, Terri.
Perfect.
You're the best.
Stop.
I'm waiting for an answer.
Cory, I like working here, and I'm good at it.
You know?
They treat me with respect.
I make a good paycheck.
And I'm learning a lot.
Every single day, I can't wait for school to be over so I can come here and learn more.
I've never felt that way about high school, so I'm sure I'm not gonna feel that way about college.
I've found something here, Cor.
Well, you sound like you've already made your decision.
Yeah.
I have.
But thanks for the advice.
You know, I'm not gonna give up on this, Shawn.
Of course you're not.
What am I going to college for?
To get a good education, to get a good job, to make good money, to get one girl to hang all over me that looks like this.
And here I have two.
I'm staying.
Gosh.
What are you I have a doorbell.
Yes?
You're my last hope.
I need you to talk to Shawn.
As a matter of fact, I was just on the phone with him.
Oh, thank you.
I told Shawn I support his decision.
You what?
I gave him my blessing.
What are you, the Pope?
Mr. Feeny, Shawn and I are supposed to go to college together.
We're supposed to be roommates.
Well, I'm sorry, but things change, and not just for students.
You know, why can't you ever just say what you mean?
Why does everything that you say have to have some hidden explanation?
Cory Cory, I'm retiring.
What do you mean by that?
Well, the school board is offering early retirement, and I've decided to take it.
But Mr. Feeny, you love teaching.
Without teaching, you're not Mr. Feeny.
You're just crazy George, the guy next door.
There comes a time when making a change feels right.
I'm thinking about moving to Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
I'll spend my time reading, fishing.
Who knows, I might even become crazy George of Jackson Hole.
You know, I can't believe you're doing this.
I mean, what did you guys all do?
Did you all get together and decide to ruin my life?
Cory.
Everything will be all right.
Hi.
I don't like the sound of that.
This came from Yale.
Dear Cory, the Ivy League is pleased to announce the further disintegration of your world.
Congratulations, Topanga.
I mean that.
How did you know I was accepted?
Because I know the way my life works.
Mom and Dad sent me out to see if you were okay.
Are you?
Well, I've been better.
How about you?
I've been better, too.
I got a 67 on my history test.
Listen, Morgan, you're not going to do anything silly, like not go to college and get a job, are you?
No.
You're not going to have a baby, or go to Yale or retire to Wyoming?
I'm still a little girl, Cory.
God bless you.
You know, this has been my booth since before you were born, Morgan.
In fact, I was sitting in this very booth when they told me I had a baby sister.
So this place means a lot to you, huh?
It's the last place left that makes any sense.
Cory, you're going crazy.
No, no, no.
The world is going crazy, Morgan.
Everything is changing so fast that I just want to be in the one place I can count on with the one person I can count on.
You, Morgan.
I'm having a great time with you, too, Cory.
Ahoy, mateys!
And now it's over.
What'll it be?
We'll have two Chubbie burgers, two fries, and two root beers.
Two buccaneer burgers, two treasure taters, and two root beers.
Why are you talking like that?
And, Maria, what are you wearing?
Please don't tell him.
Oh, my gosh, you don't know.
Please don't tell him.
Don't know what?
Everything's changed.
Chubbie.
You've been sitting here for over three hours.
Chubbie!
He moved to Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
Hey, wait a minute.
Oh, could you at least scoot over to this barrel over here while the workers pirate-ize your booth?
Oh, yeah, right.
Like it would take just a few seconds to change a booth where my girlfriend and I reunited eight different times.
To change a booth where my best friend Shawn and I dressed up like women to prove a point or something.
I forget.
So I doubt very much, missy, that you can change that much history in just a few seconds.
Wrong again.
So where is the little guy?
Ah.
Morgan, I ask you to get help and you bring him?
I was worried about you.
You were acting like a psycho.
Hey, it's about time this place got some class.
Anybody want to split a couple of buccaneer burgers?
Oh, I get it.
It's pirates.
You know, Eric, I just I've worked so hard and so long to keep everything together.
You know, what am I supposed to do, just sit here, smile, eat a buccaneer burger, and pretend everything's okay?
You're scared of change, huh?
You know, I went through that same thing when I first graduated from high school, but that's why I took a year off before I went to college.
You didn't have the grades to get into college.
I'm talking here.
Sit down.
Good things are happening to your friends, Cory, and you need to be happy for them Or else what kind of friend are you?
Okay, matey, you're the first to walk the plank.
Let me know how it is.
You know, if I take a bite of this, it's like Chubbie's is just a memory.
It's like everything's changing.
And we don't know what's going to happen.
Just taste it.
Oh, no.
It's good.
Hey, what happened to Chubbie's?
Well, guys, it's not Chubbie's anymore.
It's Peg Leg Pete's.
We've got to do something about Never mind.
Here, Jack.
Oh, no, no, no.
I have a modeling career now.
Beef goes right to the hips.
All right, guys.
Sit down.
We need to talk.
Cory, about the letter from Yale I was just really excited about getting accepted, but, I want to be with you, Cory.
Topanga, I want to be with you, too.
But this is Yale we're talking about, you know.
You can't just give that up.
And I accept that.
Good for you, Cory.
But Cory, Yale's in I don't care if Yale is on the other side of the moon.
Nothing is going to keep us apart.
And, Shawn I still think you're making the biggest mistake of your life.
But I accept it.
Thanks, Cory.
I'll try to make you proud.
There's going to be a lot of changes in your life, Cory.
It's not the changes that matter, it's how you react to the changes.
I mean, that's what makes you who you are.
Then I even accept that Feeny's retiring.
What?
He's moving to Jackson Hole.
Here in Philadelphia?
No, in Hawaii, you incredible, unbelievable moron.
Feeny can't do that.
How can Feeny do that?
I mean, I need him.
He's my mentor.
I go to him for everything.
Hmm.
Why are you not more upset about this?
Hey, things change.
Mr. Feeny!
Dude!
Regretting this immediately.
What?
There's a gnarly curl, bra.
Let's go get tubed.
All right, here I go.
So, what's with the bitchin' board, bro?
Hey, I'm coming with you to Jackson Hole, surfing capital of the world.
Come on, grab your stick.
Let's jam.
Eric, do you have any idea where Jackson Hole is?
Sure do.
Hawaii.
It's in Wyoming, you macadamia nut.
Do they surf in Wyoming, Mr. Feeny?
No, Mr. Matthews, they don't.
Well, what do they do in this Wyoming?
Well, they take the time to enjoy God's beautiful landscape.
They stop to appreciate their quiet surroundings and contemplate on what life is all about.
It sounds like a nice place.
Yes, it is.
Mr. Feeny?
Hmm?
If I'm really, really quiet, will you stay?
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
Hey, Debbie, you wanna sign my I guess you don't.
Hey, Mike, let me sign your We were never that close.
Isn't this great?
I mean, I love this week.
Yeah, me, too.
Is it over yet?
No.
Look at Frankie and Joey.
I mean, they're gonna be graduating this year, and it only took them eight years.
This is it, my good friend Joey.
Our last week as juvenile delinquents.
Yeah.
Out of high school.
The real world.
So what do you think we should be?
Criminals?
Okay.
But we should start small.
Yeah.
Let's rob our friends.
Cory, Shawn.
Hey.
Because we have shared both times good and bad, we would be honored if you would sign these yearbooks we have pilfered.
Wait.
You took somebody else's yearbooks?
But you get your own.
Where's the joy in that?
You know what, Shawn?
Even Frankie and Joey have the spirit this week, right?
I mean, what would you like me to say?
Just put down your address.
Yeah, and what time you're not gonna be home, you know.
You don't have a big dog or nothing, do you?
Just, right there.
You boys take care of yourselves.
And remember, always stay friends.
That's nice, Frankie.
Yeah, well, we like to think of ourselves as the Cory and Shawn of the underworld.
Oh, I wanna be Cory!
Can I be Cory?
That makes me Shawn.
Come on, Joey.
You see that, Shawn, huh?
Do you see how important this week is?
Saying goodbye to people we might never see again.
Saying goodbye to people who've been around, but we've sort of lost touch with.
Like who?
Well, I don't know.
I guess there's nobody really like that.
Hi, Minkus.
Oh, now it's "Hi, Minkus.
" For the last four years, it's like I haven't even been in the same school with you guys.
Well, you know, we just never saw you around.
I was.
I was just in the other part of the school.
What other part of the school?
You know, over there.
Well, we don't go there.
Yeah.
You go over there, you may never come back.
Ah, that's crazy.
Hey, Mr. Turner, wait up.
Well, Shawn, I think the time has come to sign each other's yearbooks.
Shall we talk about it first?
No, no.
Let's just do it.
Okay.
Boy, oh, boy, where to begin, huh?
What am I gonna say to you?
Man, this is gonna take me at least a week.
I'm done.
You're done?
"Hey"?
You write "hey"?
And I mean it.
You don't even write my name?
Cory, it's your yearbook.
Who else would it be to?
You know how I feel about you.
Why do I have to write it down?
Because it's just the spirit of the week, Shawn.
It's about this place.
Now, why don't you care about this?
Look what we got.
Oh!
Our senior rings.
Yeah.
They just got here.
You can pick up yours in the cafeteria, Shawn.
No, I can't because I didn't order one.
They're stupid.
They mean nothing To me.
So, have you been thinking about Yale?
This is a big decision.
I told you, Cory.
I'm going to Pennbrook with you.
That's what I want.
You don't turn down Yale without thinking about it first.
I have thought about it.
Listen, I got you some information from the Internet last night.
Okay, but promise me you'll read it before you make up your mind.
I love you, Cory.
Well, you should.
Pretending to be supportive.
Very smooth.
I'm not pretending, Shawn, and I'm not smooth.
Topanga got into Yale, and I'm proud of her.
If she cheats herself out of going because of me, how do I live with that?
But you don't want her to go.
I want to support her, and I want you to support me for supporting her.
I support you.
Go, Cory!
You're pretending, aren't you?
Yeah, Cor, just like you.
Welcome to your final week of Feeny, everyone.
Here's your assignment.
Oh, shut up.
I'm tired, too.
Now, this assignment is completely optional and is for no credit.
Oh, well, I'll get started on it right away.
Oh, look!
I'm done!
That's right, Mr. Hunter.
You don't have to do it.
I want you to write about what's in your heart during these last weeks of school.
Why are you looking at me?
I don't have to do it, right?
Do it, Shawn.
It's no pressure.
It'll be fun.
It would not be fun.
Why not?
I'm doing it, and I'm getting an A. It's for no credit, Miss Lawrence.
I have 699 A's.
I need one more.
Give me the A, Feeny!
Okay, fine.
You've got an A. You don't even have to do it.
I'll just give you an A because I'm scared of you.
Now that makes an even 700.
Seven hundred.
That's more than anybody, right?
Oh, more than anybody.
Good luck in hell, Mr. Matthews.
Surprise, Mr. Graduator!
Jack, I told you.
I'm not into this.
Oh, yeah?
Well, I got something that may change your mind.
Ta-da!
Is that supposed to be me?
Yeah.
Isn't it great?
I had a guy do it from a snapshot.
Yeah, yeah, it's great.
Now graduation really means a lot to me.
What was that?
Why don't you appreciate my caricature of you with a big head and a tiny body and you're riding the big diploma like it's a magic carpet ride to your future, huh?
Why?
You don't appreciate anything, man.
It's a crappy picture.
I hate it!
Don't you understand, man?
You will never go to high school ever again!
Yeah?
Hooray!
Well, you know what?
I'm just trying to put you in touch with your feelings.
No, no.
You're trying to put me in touch with your feelings.
Why do we always end up wrestling?
I think it's how we communicate.
Yeah.
Well, I have something else to say.
Yeah, you would.
Feeny thinks he's retiring?
He thinks he's moving away?
Uh-uh.
I'm gonna stop him.
I don't know how, but I am.
Maybe I'll ask the French for help.
Or the Belgians.
They're not doing anything.
You babies stop fighting.
Chickens in the hallway.
Chickens in the hallway!
Huh?
Someone must have let them loose as the official senior prank.
Why, this is hilarious!
Look at 'em!
Look at 'em!
Oh, my gosh!
Look at the chickens!
Chicken alert!
Yeah!
Oh, my gosh, this is crazy!
I wonder which crazy senior thought this up?
This is nuts, huh?
What'd you do, rent a couple of chickens?
Yeah.
Don't step on 'em, or else I lose my deposit.
Chickens!
You know, if I were into this, which I'm not, I'd do a senior prank that you'd remember.
Oh, I'm sure you would, Mr. Hunter.
Are you working on that assignment about what high school's meant to you?
Oh, yeah!
The assignment!
No, I'm not.
Chicken alert!
I really think you should.
Are you saying I have to?
What you end up doing, Mr. Hunter, is up to you.
Always has been.
I'm just here to point out what page we're on.
Chicken mania!
Yeah!
Whoo!
Finished my valedictorian speech.
You guys wanna hear it?
Oh?
And what makes you so sure you're the class valedictorian, little missy?
Because I'm Topanga.
Well, I'm Minkus, and I have 699 A's, which, according to my records, is the same as you.
You counted A's?
What kind of sick psychopath counts A's?
Oh, yeah.
I'll tell you what to do, Stuart.
You can go get Feeny's grade book and count them again.
You did something.
She did something, didn't she?
Take it easy, Minkus.
You never had a chance.
Oh, she's evil, Cory.
She's an evil little girl.
Yeah, but every time I kiss her, I don't care.
I read that material on Yale you gave me.
Yeah?
What do you think?
Cory, when you said you were serious about being supportive, you weren't saying that just to be supportive, were you?
Topanga, listen.
Yale is one of the best schools in the country, and you deserve to go there.
I always tried to be a good student because I thought college would be the most important decision in my life.
It is!
What could be a more important decision?
Listen, Topanga, I'm okay with this.
Really?
Yeah.
Go.
Thank you.
You guys gonna leave me, too?
Topanga's going to Yale.
Told you, man.
This is gonna be a terrible week.
Gosh.
Why did I have to act so supportive?
So you were just pretending.
I didn't think she'd actually go through with it.
So, tell her how you really feel.
I can't.
Why not?
Because I don't want her making the wrong choice because of me.
And you're not pretending this time?
No, I'm not.
Mr. Feeny, hey.
I was in the library, and I saw your light on.
What are you still doing here?
Oh, just packing up a few things.
What on earth are you doing in the library?
I was working on my valedictorian speech.
Oh, your speech will be fine.
Give yourself a break.
Yeah, but now that I'm going to Yale, everyone's going to expect it to be like from someone who's going to Yale.
Fine's not gonna be enough.
Miss Lawrence, what did you actually come here to ask me?
I don't know what to do.
Should I go to Yale?
If you're asking me if Yale is one of the finest academic institutions in the country, I would have to say, "duh"!
That's not why I'm asking.
Well, if you're asking me whether or not you would be successful there, Yale wouldn't have accepted you if they didn't think you could live up to the challenge.
That's not why I'm asking.
I'll tell you what.
I retire right now, hmm?
What do you want?
If I knew what I wanted, I wouldn't have come to you.
Well, then listen very carefully.
Unless you have a very good reason for not going to Yale, you should go.
Thanks, Mr. Feeny.
You're welcome.
If you need any more counseling, my door is always open to my students.
Okay, Mr. Feeny, you are not retiring.
You're not going anywhere.
However, I must learn to close my window.
You are gonna live in that house next to my parents until you die or until I die, whichever one comes first.
Although, you know, it'd probably be you because you're like, what, 80?
Get out!
Okay.
Hey, Topanga.
Hi.
Well, the bell is about to ring.
In a few minutes, you'll be flying out of here like your pants were on fire.
But since this is our last class together, I just wanna say Usually, I time it better than that.
Okay.
The bell rang.
We wanna hear what you have to say.
We've got time.
Oh, well, I was just gonna say good luck.
The truth is, I'm not very good at saying goodbye.
We're not gonna get all sappy, are we?
We wanted to know if your decision to retire had anything to do with us.
Mr. Feeny, we know we haven't made life that easy for you these past couple of years.
I mean, when you think about all the stupid stuff we pulled You have to be leaving because of us.
Well, I am.
But not because of what you've done to me.
Because of what you've done for me.
We haven't done anything for you.
You three have given me more gratification in the past four years than I ever dreamed possible.
You must know that.
But you always complained about how difficult we are.
Well, you are.
But sometimes the things you complain most about are the things that you care most about.
Unfortunately, we don't always know that until it's too late.
By the way, how is that paper coming?
I would like to welcome you all to the graduation ceremonies of the class of '98.
Congratulations.
We did it!
And now it's time to introduce our valedictorian, a student who exemplifies academic excellence, as well as extracurricular achievement and social conscience.
She got one more lousy A than I did!
Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Topanga Lawrence.
Cory, you're not clapping.
I can't.
The closer we get to graduating, the closer she gets to Yale.
Thank you, Mr. Feeny.
Ladies and gentlemen, my fellow class members of the class of '98, I'm very honored to be your valedictorian, and I worked very hard on this speech, however, I'm not going to give it.
'Cause I know somebody who could give a much better speech than I ever could.
Ladies and gentlemen, my good friend, Shawn Hunter.
Hey!
You only go to high school once.
Thank you, Topanga.
You know, I read her speech.
It kicked butt.
I attended John Adams High School sporadically during the last four years.
I barely have a C average, that's why I'm here.
Mr. Feeny asked us to write about what we were feeling this week, and, of course, I was feeling like I always do, I couldn't wait to get out of here.
Cory, I know what I wanna do with my life.
Shh.
Shawn's speaking in public.
This will never happen again in our lives.
But now high school is over.
And just when I'm finally free, I find myself sneaking back into this place and sitting in the hall, thinking about my friends and all the time we spent here.
And you, Mr. Feeny.
I started thinking about you and how you've always told us what to do without ever telling us what to do.
You taught us about life.
I was thinking about how much this place has been my home and how many times I screwed up while I was here, how I could've done better.
I could've done better.
That's, um That's what I wrote.
That's how I feel.
I'm sorry.
I could've done better.
Congratulations to those of you who did.
Shawn That was a fine paper.
No one could've done better.
Now I would like to say something.
No!
You're not going anywhere.
Hi, everybody.
Hey, Mom.
Hey, Dad.
Excuse me.
Hey, kids, congratulations.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Need this.
Eric Uh, as most of you already know, at the end of this school year, Mr. Feeny will be retiring, and as a former student at John Adams High, it made me real mad.
Hello.
I'm Eric Matthews.
Eric, give me the microphone.
Back off, old man.
Eric!
Cor, I know what I'm doing.
Mr. Feeny, um, I could tell you what I think about you, but it would just come out a bunch of words, and I know that nobody could say it better than a little girl named Lulu.
Music.
Come on.
Let's get out of here.
Shawn Hunter.
Erica Jackson.
My little brother up there.
Shh!
Topanga Lawrence.
Cynthia Little.
Cory Matthews.
Jackie Miller.
Stuart Minkus.
Angela Moore.
Phyllis Nakamura.
Steven So you were gonna say something.
Was that important?
You mean that I decided what I want to do with my life?
Yeah, that.
Mr. Feeny said I should go to Yale unless I have a really good reason not to.
Well, there isn't any good reason.
Actually, there is.
Myra Zinkerman.
Cory What?
Ladies and gentlemen, the John Adams High School class of 1998.
Will you marry me?
