{START OF EPISODE 1}
It's amazing to me that people move thousands of miles away to another city.
They think nothing of it.
They get on a plane.
They live there now.
Just a thousand miles I'm living over there.
You know, pioneers It took years to cross the country.
Now people will move thousands of miles just for one season.
I don't think any pioneers did that.
"Yeah, it took us a decade to get there and we stayed for the summer.
It was nice.
It had a pool.
The kids loved it.
And then we left about 10 years ago, and we just got back.
We had a great summer.
It took us 20 years and now our lives are over".
- Kramer was on Murphy Brown?
- Yeah.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
Murphy Brown, the TV show?
Come on, will you?
Kramer was on Murphy Brown?
That son of a gun.
- It's something, isn't it?
- With Candice Bergen.
- I know.
- I've always liked her.
Remember her in Carnal Knowledge?
- Sure.
- She show her breasts in that?
She's not really the naked type.
I can't believe I missed Kramer.
He asked me to go with him.
- He did?
- Yeah.
I turned him down.
- How come you didn't tell me?
- He asked me to keep it a secret.
- You can never keep a secret.
- I know.
This was like a record.
My previous record was when Jodi Hirsch asked me not to tell anybody we slept together.
I kept a lid on that for about 28 seconds.
- Well, you've come a long way.
- I've matured.
The Tonight Show called and they want me to do the show on the 28th.
They're giving me free tickets to L.A. You wanna go?
A free ticket?
Yeah.
In fact, we could track down Kramer.
I always felt bad about the way he left.
That was a mess.
I never should've taken back those keys.
- What about accommodations?
- All taken care of.
Is there a meal allowance?
What about seat assignments?
Could I have the kosher meal?
I hear the kosher meal is good.
And I need clothes.
I gotta get a haircut.
And I have to refill my allergy medication.
Do I need a hat?
I need a hat, don't I?
Could we do the Universal tour?
They have that Backdraft exhibit.
Now, that looks very cool to me.
See, my acting technique My personal acting technique is working with color.
Imagining color and then finding the emotional, vibrational mood connected to the color.
If you look through my scripts you'll see that my lines have a special color.
So I don't memorize the language.
I memorize color.
This way, I can go through red, yellow, green, blue.
And you have a full palette of emotions.
Hey.
Didn't I tell you to get out of here?
- Did you?
- Let's go.
- I was just - Yeah, you were just nothing.
Come on, let's go.
We'll talk about this a little later.
- Let's go.
- Are you an actor?
See you, Mike!
- Murphy Brown.
- Yeah, Candice Bergen, please.
Who's calling, please?
Well, just tell her that it's Kramer.
All right, I'll I'll call her at home.
Here.
Go ahead.
It's all yours.
- Hello, Kramer.
- Oh, Helene.
How are you?
I haven't worked since 1934.
How do you think I am?
Well, that's only - Fifty-eight years.
- It was a Three Stooges short.
"Sappy Pappies".
I played Mr. Sugarman's secretary, remember?
Right, yeah.
That was a Shemp, right?
No, no.
Curly.
The boys played three sailors who find a baby.
The baby's been kidnapped, and the police think they did it.
- Right.
- Of course, they didn't do it.
The police have made an awful mistake.
Moe hits Curly with an ax.
- The Stooges catch the kidnappers.
- Right.
- But it's too late.
- Really?
- The baby's dead.
- Really?
The boys are sent to death row and are executed.
Well, I don't remember that part.
I play Mr. Sugarman's secretary.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
You were very good.
It was sad for a Three Stooges, what with the dead baby and the Stooges being executed and all.
Yeah, well, that was an unusual choice for the Stooges.
Would you like to buy me a fat-free frozen yogurt at the store, Kramer?
Well, you know, I can't right now, you know.
I got a very big meeting.
I got these people interested in my movie treatment.
So we'll have to make it another time, all right?
No, no!
No, no, don't go up there, Kramer.
They'll hurt you.
You'll never make it in this town.
You're too sensitive, like me.
Helene, you're wrong.
You know, I'm not that sensitive.
I was engaged to Mickey Rooney.
He left me at the altar.
Kramer.
Kramer!
- What is this?
- What?
We're going on a two-day trip.
What are you, Diana Ross?
I happen to dress based on mood.
But you essentially wear the same thing all the time.
Seemingly.
Seemingly.
But within that basic framework, there are many subtle variations only discernible to an acute observer that reflect the many moods, the many shades the many sides of George Costanza.
- What mood is this?
- This is "morning mist".
What do you figure?
Twenty?
- Twenty-one?
- Close enough.
Forensics ought to be able to nail it down.
- No ID?
- No ID.
- No witnesses?
- Just the trees, Johnny.
Just the trees.
Pretty young thing.
She was.
Not anymore.
Somebody saw to that.
Sure did, Johnny.
Damn shame too.
What do you make of it?
I don't know.
But I don't like it.
Look at this guy.
He's like a cat burglar.
He thinks if he goes through real slow, the machine won't detect him.
I've always been nervous about going through these things.
I'm afraid I'm gonna step into another dimension.
Just go.
I made it.
Empty your pockets, please.
Walk through again, please.
Are you sure you don't have metal on you?
- Bracelets, rings, anklets?
- Anklets?
No.
- A lot of men wear anklets.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- What do you have in your bag, sir?
- My bag?
- Step over here, please.
- Over here?
- Do you have a knife in the bag?
A knife?
Open the bag, please.
- What's this?
- Moisturizer.
For your wife?
No.
I I use it.
Spread your arms and legs, please.
Ladies and gentlemen, I implore you.
Have a good trip.
- All right.
- That's it?
- That's it.
- All right.
Come on, Jerry, let's go.
- What was that all about?
- I must have iron-rich blood.
- Here we go.
L.A. - The coast.
La-la land.
- I got the window seat, right?
- Who said that?
- I called it.
- Oh, no.
It seems to me that the closest thing we have to royalty in America are the people that get to ride in those carts through the airport.
Don't you hate these things?
They come out of nowhere.
Beep-beep.
"Cart people.
Look out.
Cart people.
Look out".
We all scurry out of the way like worthless peasants.
"It's cart people.
I hope we didn't slow you down.
Wave to the cart people, Timmy.
They're the best people in the world".
You know, if you're too fat, slow and disoriented to get to your gate on time, you're not ready for air travel.
I hate the people that get onto the moving walkway and then just stand there.
Like it's a ride.
"Excuse me, there's no animated pirates or bears along the way here.
Do your legs work at all"?
Yeah, I'm here for the audition.
Which audition?
The music video, the horror movie the exercise tape, or the infomercial?
Let's see.
Well You scream good.
You too.
- So can I keep this treatment?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
I got 20 copies.
Because I can show it to my manager.
He has connections with West German television money.
Yeah, they're trying to put together a miniseries for me on Eva Braun.
I mean, think about it.
Is that a great idea?
We know nothing about Eva Braun, only that she was Hitler's girlfriend.
What was it like having sex with Adolf Hitler?
What do you wear in a bunker?
What did her parents think of Hitler as a potential son-in-law?
- I could go on and on - Wait, wait, hold on.
Look who's over there.
Don't look, don't look.
It's Fred Savage.
- Big deal.
- He'd be perfect for my movie.
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
I gotta go over there.
I gotta give him a copy of my treatment.
Why are you breathing so hard?
I'm just a little nervous.
Okay, I gotta relax.
All right.
Wish me luck, huh?
Hey.
Oh, did I frighten you?
I'm not crazy.
I look weird, but I'm just like you.
I'm just a regular guy trying to make it in this business.
You know, I really like your work.
The - Thank you.
- I can't remember the name.
- My mind's a blank.
I'm nervous.
- That's okay.
- You know - Just relax.
Okay, yeah.
But I got Stupid table.
I'm not normally like this.
Usually I'm cool and charming.
I don't mean to bother you.
It's fate that you happened to be here at the same time as me.
It's fate.
You can't avoid your fate.
I got this treatment I think you'd be great in.
- I'll give it to you.
- Yeah, okay.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
Oh, wait.
Are you going now?
- Bye.
- Wait, wait.
Yeah, that's Kramer.
K-R-A-M-E-R.
I don't know, wavy.
George, how would you describe Kramer's hair?
- Curly.
- Wavy.
- What did you ask me for?
- Yeah.
I'll hold on.
George, did you see a piece of paper on the nightstand like, crumpled up like a napkin?
- No.
Because I had three jokes on it.
They were perfectly worded just the way I wanted to have it.
I can't find it.
Hello?
Hey, a shoe-buffing machine.
I don't know, 6'3"?
George, how tall is Kramer?
You got your own shampoo, conditioner Body lotion, Jerry, body lotion.
- About 6'3".
- A shower cap.
Come in.
Hello.
I have more towels.
Oh, good, good.
Come in, come in.
Welcome.
I'm George.
- Hello.
- Hi.
And this is Jerry over there on the phone.
That's Jerry.
And you are?
- Lupe.
- Lupe.
That's very nice.
Listen, are you gonna be making the bed in the morning?
- Oh, yes.
- Fine, excellent.
Could you do me a favor?
Could you not tuck the blankets in?
Because I can't sleep all tucked in.
- Oh, yes, yes.
- Yes.
I like to just be able to take the blankets and swish them and swirl them.
You know what I mean?
You know, I don't like them all tucked in.
I just don't.
I like to have a lot of room.
I like to have my toes pointed up in the air.
I just like to scrunch up the blankets.
Yes, yes.
It's too tight to sleep.
Exactly.
You know what I'm talking about, right?
Yes.
It's too tight.
- Him too?
- You want your blankets tucked in?
- What?
- Want your blankets tucked in?
- What blankets?
- When Lupe makes up the beds.
I don't know.
Whatever they do.
I tuck in, yes?
Tuck in.
Tuck in.
All right.
So that's one tuck and one no-tuck.
- Okay.
- Yes.
One second, sweetheart.
Jerry, it'd be easier if you didn't tuck.
Excuse me.
Fine.
You don't want me to tuck put me down for a no-tuck.
It's two no-tucks.
Hang on a second.
You know what?
Changed my mind.
Make it a tuck.
- You just said you weren't tucking.
- I'm tucking.
Hello?
Hello?
They hung up on me.
They don't know where Kramer is anyway.
Alrighty.
So that's one tuck and one no-tuck.
You got that?
Excuse me.
Did you see a piece of paper on the nightstand here earlier today, crumpled up like a napkin?
Oh, yes, yes.
I throw away when we clean the room.
- Oh, okay.
Thanks.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
All right, Lupe, bye-bye now.
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.
I can't believe she threw that out.
I had the perfect wording of a joke I was gonna do about the airport.
I was gonna do it on The Tonight Show.
Now I can't remember it.
What did you want?
You left it on the table.
They're not supposed to throw everything out.
Hey, hey!
It's not Lupe's fault.
- You shouldn't have left it out.
- All right.
Just get your thing together and let's get out of here.
All right.
Now, what mood am I in?
What mood am l?
- You shouldn't have tucked.
- I like it tucked.
Nobody tucks anymore.
- Hey, lieutenant?
- Yeah.
This was found on her person.
On her person?
- What kind of expression is that?
- I don't know, sir.
Police lingo.
Oh, yeah?
What's your name, son?
- Ross.
- Ross.
- You see that person there, Ross?
- Yes, sir.
She's dead.
- Have you got that?
- Yes, sir.
Good.
Get out before you find yourself on transit patrol writing tickets to senior citizens with fake bus passes.
Yes, sir.
I think we just caught a break.
This is very exciting.
You're on The Tonight Show.
NBC.
Who else is on the show?
- I don't know.
- You might meet a celebrity.
I can't believe she threw out my napkin.
What are you worried about?
You know it.
- You're gonna be all right here?
- Yeah.
Go about your business.
- I'll just wander around.
- All right.
Don't wander too far.
I'll meet you back here in 15 minutes.
Go, go.
Don't worry about me.
Hey.
Corbin Bernsen.
How you doing?
- Big fan.
Big fan.
- Thank you.
- Hey, you grew a beard, huh?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm doing a movie during my hiatus.
Hey, you know Do I have a case for you guys to do on L.A. Law.
Really.
So mind you, at this point, I'm only going out with her two, three weeks.
So she goes out of town, and she asks me to feed her cat.
So, at this time, there's a lot of stuff going on in my life and it slips my mind for a few days.
Maybe a week.
Not even a week.
Five, six days.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So, what happened?
Well, it's the damnedest thing.
The cat dies.
So she comes back.
She finds the cat, lying on the carpet, stiff as a board.
- So you killed the cat?
- That's what she says.
I say, "Listen It was an old cat.
It died of natural causes".
So get this.
Now she tells me that I gotta buy her a brand-new cat.
I say, "Listen, honey, first of all it was a pretty old cat.
I'm not gonna buy you a brand-new cat to replace an old dying cat.
And second of all, I go out to the garbage I find you a new cat in 15 seconds".
I say, "You show me an autopsy report that says this cat died of starvation I spring for a new cat".
So she says something to me, like, I don't know "Get the hell out of here".
And she breaks up with me.
Now, don't you think that would be a great case on L.A. Law?
I don't wanna tell you how to run your show No, of course not.
It's enough with the bar already, you know what I'm saying?
Have they thought about changing the setting?
Doubt it.
I doubt it.
Yeah.
Because people do meet in places besides a bar.
Well, yeah, they do.
What about a rec room, huh?
Or a community center.
You ought to write one of those.
I'll bring it up with the producers.
I gotta Fabulous.
I'll think about that, George.
Thank you.
- How's it going?
- Great, great.
I actually just had two meaningful, intelligent conversations with Corbin Bernsen and George Wendt.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Not fan talk.
Not gushing.
You know?
Actual conversation.
I was incredibly articulate.
You got toilet paper on your heel there.
It's The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.
Tonight Jay welcomes Corbin Bernsen, George Wendt and comedian, Jerry Seinfeld.
Oh, yeah.
People are always trying to give me a great case for L.A. Law.
Just a few seconds ago, right outside in the hallway this nut, some sick nut comes up to me and says he was supposed to watch this girl's cat while she was away out of town.
Anyway, he forgets to feed the cat.
The cat dies, starves to death.
He kills the cat.
Refuses to get her a new one.
Won't give her any money, won't pay her.
And he wants Arnie Becker to represent him.
Nice guy.
Yeah, that'd make a great case for L.A. Law.
Thanks a lot.
He's a very handsome man.
Passionate, intense.
But troubled, strange.
I think he may be in love with me.
Of course, there's nothing abnormal about that.
I have many suitors.
It's funny, because even after all these years we still get people giving us advice how to improve the show.
Actually, a few moments ago, I ran into a nut back there who said that maybe we should think about you know, not doing the show in a bar.
So that's when I said, "Hey, Kramer, dude you ever kill a man before"?
And he said, "What do you think, junior?
These hands have been soaking in lvory Liquid"?
That guy you talked to, what did he look like?
- Short little bald guy with glasses.
- That's the same guy I talked to.
Never ends, does it?
So I'm going through the airport, and I put my bag on that little The The conveyor belt.
Issue an arrest warrant.
Put out an APB.
Let's pick up this Kramer.
- I was terrible.
- What, are you crazy?
You were fine.
I couldn't remember what I was trying to say.
- That whole thing about the - Conveyor belt.
Yeah.
Because she threw out my napkin.
I can't believe You're blaming Lupe?
Yes.
Lupe.
I'm blaming Lupe.
Our top story tonight: There's been a break in the so-called Smog Stranglings.
Police have just released a photo of the suspect being sought in connection with the slaying.
He is known only as Kramer.
Talk show hosts never seem to have any idea how much time is left in the show.
They're always looking off-camera: "Do we have time?
How are we doing on time?
Anybody know what the time is?
What's the time"?
You never see Magnum P.I. go, "Should I strangle this guy or are we gonna take a break here?
Can you stay for another beating?
I'll bop him in the head.
We'll do a commercial, come back, I'll drive the car real fast.
Stay with us".
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Last week on Seinfeld.
Yeah, I'm here for the audition.
The Tonight Show called and they want me to do the show on the 28th.
They're giving me tickets to L.A. - You wanna go?
- A free ticket?
In fact, we could track down Kramer.
I got a very big meeting.
I got people interested in my treatment.
- Pretty young thing.
- She was.
It's a two-day trip.
What are you, Diana Ross?
Ladies and gentlemen, I implore you.
Don't look.
Don't look.
It's Fred Savage.
Did I frighten you?
I may look weird, but I'm just like you.
I'm just a regular guy, just trying to make it in this business.
- No witnesses?
- Just the trees, Johnny.
Just the trees.
Could you not tuck the blankets in?
Because I can't sleep all tucked in.
I think we just caught a break.
All right.
So that's one tuck and one no-tuck.
So that's when I said, "Hey, Kramer, dude, you ever kill a man before"?
You're on The Tonight Show.
NBC.
- Who else is on?
- I don't know.
Corbin Bernsen.
Do I have a case for you guys to do on L.A. Law.
I don't wanna tell you how to run the show - No, of course not.
- It's enough with the bar already.
He's a very handsome man.
Passionate, intense.
But troubled, strange.
- Let's pick up this Kramer.
- Kramer!
Police have just released a photo of the suspect being sought in connection with the slayings.
He is known only as Kramer.
There are many different jobs in the police.
It seems to me that "chalk outline guy" is one of the better jobs that you can get.
You know, it's not too dangerous.
The criminals are long gone.
That seems like a good one.
I guess they're people that wanted to be sketch artists but they couldn't draw too well.
"Listen, Johnson, forget the sketches.
Do you think if we left the body right there on the sidewalk you could manage to trace around it?
Could you do that"?
How does that even help them solve the crime?
They look at the thing.
"His arm was like that when he hit the pavement.
That means the killer must have been Jim".
- He's on the loose.
- Let go of my arm.
You'll get us killed.
What are we supposed to do?
What do you do in this situation?
Should we call a lawyer or the police?
Obviously, we're gonna call the police and tell them he's not the guy.
- We hope he's not the guy.
- Couldn't be the guy.
God, I'm starved.
I'm weak with hunger.
How can you think of food at a time like this?
A time like what?
I'm hungry.
My stomach doesn't know that Kramer's wanted.
I told you, you should have had breakfast.
I couldn't have breakfast.
It was lunchtime.
The three-hour time difference threw me.
I wanted a tuna fish sandwich.
They wouldn't serve me one because they were only serving breakfast.
- You should've had some eggs.
- For lunch?
Who eats eggs for lunch?
Have you ever heard of egg salad?
Why didn't you say something?
I gotta tell you about egg salad?
I need food, Jerry.
I'm feeling faint.
I'm getting lightheaded.
I gotta call the police.
There's a pay phone.
Pay phone in L.A. Look, it's a miracle.
I have no change.
You got any change?
No, I don't.
I never carry change.
- We need change.
All I got is 20s.
- I have a 10.
- So break it.
- I hate asking for change.
They make a face.
It's like I'm asking them to donate a kidney.
- So buy something.
- What?
I don't know.
Some mints or Tic Tacs.
- Breath problem?
- No.
I just want some change.
- Tell me.
- Your breath is fine.
It's delightful.
It's delicious.
- You know, I haven't eaten anything.
- I just wanna call the police.
Why don't you just call 911?
- But is this an emergency?
- Of course it is.
How is this an emergency?
Your friend has been accused of being a serial killer.
I think that qualifies.
All right, I'll call 911.
Do you think he did it?
Could he have done it?
He couldn't have done it.
How could he have?
Couldn't do it.
Could he?
Hello, 911?
How are you?
I'm sorry.
Just a reflex.
I know it's an emergency number.
It is an emergency.
My friend's been accused of being the Smog Strangler and I know he didn't do it.
They're putting me through to the detective in charge.
Making terrific headway.
What is my name?
Who am I?
I'm George Costanza.
What's the matter?
Are you crazy?
- What are you using my name for?
- Don't be a baby.
- What are you scared of?
- I'm scared of the same thing you are: Everything.
Why don't you just use your own name?
Your name is a good name.
Costanza.
Sounds like it stands for something.
- They'll believe us.
- Really?
- Sure.
- You think so?
Oh, yeah.
Yes, I have very important information regarding the Smog Strangler.
Get yourself a mint or something.
Can I come in right now?
I suppose.
Where are you located?
Where is that?
I don't know where we are.
Where are we?
- I don't know - We don't know.
He says, "Ask somebody".
Ask that guy.
- Excuse me, where are we?
- Earth.
Hey, you know, I'm on the phone with the police.
Some guy just gave me a wise answer.
Ask that woman.
- Excuse me, what street are we on?
- I don't know.
- You don't know?
- I don't know.
How could you not know what street you're on?
You don't know.
George, it says here on the phone.
It's 12145 Ventura Boulevard.
Okay.
Do we know where the 101 is?
No.
Do we know where the 170 is?
No.
Do we know where the 134 is?
No.
Okay.
He's gonna send a black and white to pick us up.
- Black and white?
- Cop car.
- Why didn't you just say that?
- I thought it sounded cool.
- Yeah, real cool.
You're a cool guy.
- Oh, you are.
I guarantee you Lupe's gonna tuck your covers in.
- I'll bet you.
How much?
- Her tip.
- You got a bet.
- Okay.
How much do you tip a chambermaid?
Which one of you is Costanza?
Get in.
Hi.
How are you?
Guys, listen do either one of you have a mint, or a piece of gum, or something?
Hey, Jerry, do me a favor.
Close your window.
Hey, get out of here.
- Hey, he's fooling around back here.
- Cut it out back there.
- He started it.
- I did not.
You guys gonna go through some red lights?
I don't think so.
- But you could.
- Oh, yeah.
Of course we could.
We could do anything we want.
We can drive on the wrong side of the road.
We do that all the time.
You should see the looks on the people's faces.
Shoot people.
You guys ever shot anybody?
- No.
- No.
- Can I flip on the siren?
- Why are you bothering them?
I'm just asking.
All they have to do is say no.
Yeah, go ahead.
- Check it out.
- Can I try it?
Yeah, go ahead.
Hurry up.
Scared the hell out of that guy.
You know what I've never understood?
Why did they change the siren noise?
When I was a kid, it was always: You know, and now it's: Why'd they do that?
Did they do some research?
Did they find out "woo-woo" is more effective than "waa"?
Yeah, hey, what about those English sirens, you know?
Hey!
I'm dizzy.
- Nice shotgun.
- Thanks.
- Clean as a whistle.
- You could eat off that shotgun.
- What is that, a 12-gauge?
- Yeah.
Twelve-gauge.
Seems to be the most popular gauge.
- Big gauge.
My favorite.
- Mine too.
Love the 12-gauge.
Makes the 11 -gauge look like a cap pistol.
- What do we got over there?
- What?
- I don't know.
- Looks like a possible 519.
- 519?
What's a 519?
- Where?
- You think so?
- Looks like it.
- I can't believe this.
A 519?
- Where?
Where?
I can't see.
This is car 23.
We have a possible All right.
Let's pull over and check it out.
Pull over?
You can't pull over.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
Pull over?
The lieutenant is waiting to see us.
- Hey, hey, hey.
We're in a rush here!
- We have an appointment.
What are you doing?
Great.
There's a bag of Pepperidge Farm cookies up there.
- What kind?
- Milano.
Cops eating Milanos?
What kind of crazy town is this?
- Should I take some?
- I think that's a 519.
I'm starving.
- Spread them.
- Hey, they're busting this guy.
They're cuffing him.
I can't believe this.
I can't believe that cops still have to read that whole "you have the right to remain silent" speech to every criminal they arrest.
Is there anybody that doesn't know that by now?
Can't they go, "You're under arrest.
You ever seen a Baretta"?
"Yeah".
"Good.
Get in the car".
Hi.
Hi, I'm Jerry.
George.
How you doing?
What'd you do?
- Nothing.
- Nothing.
Oh, yeah, right.
Me neither.
Hey, I didn't do nothing.
Shut up.
- Hot out.
- Brutal.
What do you tip a chambermaid?
I don't know.
Five bucks a night.
No.
A dollar.
Two, tops.
Hey, you guys aren't cuffed.
What are you, narcs?
- Narcs.
- Imagine.
Us, narcs.
No, no.
No, actually, we're friends of a serial killer.
- Just trying to help him out.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- That's very nice.
- Thank you.
- Suspected serial killer.
- He didn't actually do it.
- Yeah, well, we don't think.
We're pretty sure.
- A dollar a night?
- Yeah.
That's a good tip.
- That stinks.
- I read it in Ann Landers.
- Ann Landers sucks!
- Hey, shut up back there.
Attention, all units.
Attention, all units.
All units, code three.
All units in the area, code three in progress.
assistance in apprehension, 702.
- That's the Smog Strangler.
- Kramer.
- They got him.
- Let's go.
We've gotta go.
Let's see what's happening.
I don't know why I'm doing this.
Oh, man.
Jerry.
George.
You're under arrest for first-degree murder in the death of Chelsea Lange.
Why'd you do it?
Why'd you do it?
People wanna know, please!
- What possessed you?
- Well, I don't know.
- Do you have any regrets?
- How are you?
Hey!
Hey!
- Hey, how you doing?
Jerry!
George!
- We're doing fine.
How are you?
What?
Me?
Fabulous.
Just fabulous.
I got a lot of auditions, a lot of callbacks.
I got a lot of interest in my movie treatment.
You know, I'm in development.
I'm developing vehicles.
Man, there's a lot of energy here, man.
You know, the vibe, it's powerful.
I'm just swept up in it.
Yeah, I'm a player.
- You're a player?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
I'm a player.
Kramer, do you realize what's going on here?
Do you know why you're here?
What, this?
I'll be out of here in a couple of hours.
Hey, guess who I met today.
Fred Savage.
Oh, nice kid.
A really good kid.
You know, we're talking about doing a project together.
Kramer, you've been arrested as a serial killer.
So?
I'm innocent.
I mean, you guys believe that I'm innocent, don't you?
Jerry?
George?
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah, sure.
Kramer, let's go.
Lieutenant wants to see you.
Yeah, okay, yeah.
All right.
Look, I'll be out of here by noon.
Hey, maybe we'll have lunch together, huh?
Hey, is it all right if I talk to them again?
Yeah, okay.
Help me!
Oh, God, help me!
Get me out of here!
George, Jerry, get me out!
Get me!
I didn't kill anyone.
I swear.
I swear to God!
Don't you ever swear to my God, Kramer.
My God protects the innocent and punishes evil scum like you.
- Have you got that?
- You're making a big mistake.
No!
You made a mistake, Kramer.
Sickies like you always do.
The only difference is this time you're gonna pay.
Now, you might beat the gas chamber, Kramer.
But as long as I've got a breath you will never see the light of day again.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
You got the wrong man!
It wasn't me!
Yeah, right.
Maybe it was one of your other personalities.
What?
The wise guy, the little kid, the bellhop, the ballplayer?
Maybe the door-to-door vacuum cleaner salesman, but not you.
No, you wouldn't hurt a fly.
You just couldn't help yourself, could you, Kramer?
You saw a life, brimming brightly with optimism and verve and you just had to snuff it out.
- Can I talk to somebody?
- You're not letting me explain!
- I don't want your explanations.
Sure, I bet you've got a million of them.
Maybe your mom didn't love you enough.
Maybe the teacher didn't call on you when you had your hand raised.
Maybe the pervert in the park had a present in his pants, huh?
Oh, I got another theory for you.
- You're a weed.
- No.
- Society's filled with them.
- No.
You're choking the life out of all the pretty flowers.
You see something young and pretty you just got to choke the life out of it, don't you?
You killed the pretty flowers, didn't you, Kramer?
You killed the pretty little flowers, didn't you?
You dirty, filthy, stinking weed!
Didn't you?
I Lieutenant, for you.
Martel.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
- What is it, lieutenant?
- Let him go.
- What?
But, lieutenant - You heard me.
Let him go.
Get him out of here.
They just found another body up in Laurel Canyon.
Go on, Kramer.
Get out of my sight.
How'd you know about the guy in the park?
I said, beat it.
- What happened?
- Somebody got killed while they had me in custody.
- Really?
Hear that?
Somebody else was killed.
No kidding!
Somebody else got killed?
While he was in jail.
So you're free!
Yes, I'm free because the murderer struck again.
Hey!
So, Kramer, what are you gonna do?
Do?
Do?
Hey, I'm doing what I do.
You know, I've always done what I do.
I'm doing what I do.
The way I've always done it, and the way I'll always do it.
Kramer, what the hell are you talking about?
Well, what do you want me to say?
That things haven't worked out the way I've planned?
That I'm struggling, barely able to keep my head above water?
That L.A.'s a cold place even in the middle of summer.
That it's a lonely place even when you're stuck in traffic on the freeway?
That I'm no better than the screenwriter driving a cab the starlet turning tricks, the producer in a house he can't afford?
Is that what you want me to say?
- I'd like to hear that.
- Yeah.
Well, I'm not saying that.
You know, things are going pretty well for me here.
- I met a girl.
- Kramer, she was murdered.
Yeah, well, you know, I wasn't looking for a long-term relationship.
- I was on TV.
- As a suspect in a serial killing.
Okay, yeah, all right.
You guys gotta put a negative spin on everything.
What do they put in this tuna?
Tastes like a dill.
I think it's a dill.
- So you're not coming back with us?
- No, I'm not ready, you know.
I mean, things are starting to happen for me.
Taste this.
Is this a dill?
No, it's a tarragon.
Listen, Kramer, I'm sorry about that whole fight we had about you having my apartment keys and everything.
All right.
Okay, it's forgotten.
- Tarragon?
- Yeah.
Oh, you're crazy.
- Take it easy, buddy.
- Yeah, okay.
Yep, take care.
Stay in touch.
Hey, wait, wait, wait.
Come on, give me a hug, you guys.
Kramer, my sandwich.
You're crushing my sandwich.
You know, it's so nice when it happens good.
- Mint?
- No, thanks.
I gotta tell you.
I'm really disappointed in Lupe.
It's been three days already.
Forget about Lupe.
Think she gets to take any of those little bars of soap home?
No, I don't.
You'd think when they hand out the checks, they'd throw in a few soaps.
Yeah, maybe they should throw in a couple of lamps too.
I'll tell you, if I owned a company, my employees would love me.
They'd have huge pictures of me on the walls and in their home.
Like Lenin.
How much did you wind up tipping her?
Oh, my God, I forgot.
That's why communism didn't work.
Hey!
- Got any mustard?
This is empty.
- Yeah, there's a new one in there.
No, no.
I don't like this one.
It's too yellow.
- Did you know he was back?
- No.
- Got any pickles?
- Help yourself.
Yeah.
All right.
Kramer, what are you doing here?
I'm getting something to eat.
Kramer.
Here.
Authorities disclosed today that the latest Smog Stranglings suspect was apprehended this week on an unrelated charge but somehow managed to escape from the police car in which he was being held.
Tobias Lehigh Nagy, who is also wanted in connection with unrelated slayings in the Northwest is still at large, his whereabouts unknown.
He is described as 5'5", bald and reputedly a very generous tipper.
The thing about L.A. to me that kind of threw me was when, you know, they have the smog alerts out there.
And they actually recommend that people stay indoors during the smog alert.
Now, maybe I'm way off but don't you think?
Wouldn't you assume that the air in the house pretty much comes from the air in the city where the house is?
What do they think?
We live in a jar with a couple of holes punched in the top?
What the hell's going on out there?
It's very strange.
Do you realize it is now possible for parents to say to their children: "All right, kids, I want you in the house and get some fresh air.
Summer vacation.
Everybody indoors".
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Parents like to drag kids to historical sights.
I remember going to Colonial Williamsburg and you see the supposedly authentic blacksmith there.
He's got the three-cornered hat, knickers and the Def Leppard shirt.
My parents took me to the Amish country, which to a kid to see a bunch of people that have no cars, no TV, no phone they go, "So what?
Neither do I." So it's the whole community that's been grounded.
That's the way they should punish the kids.
"All right, get up to your room.
I've had it.
You are Amish, young man.
For the rest of this weekend.
Did you hear me?
Amish.
Don't come down till you make some noodles and raise a barn".
They have a guide.
He takes you shows you the battlefield, gives you a bit of the history.
How far is Gettysburg?
I'd like to go.
- About three hours.
- Tommy, you're on.
- Gotta go.
- Have a good set.
What did they do for toilet paper in the Civil War?
Wonder what toilet paper was like in the 1860s.
Did they?
Did they carry it in rolls in their duffel bags?
Everything with you comes down to toilet paper.
- What?
- That's always the first question with you.
Why is that always your focus?
- Then what did they do?
- I don't know.
Maybe they gave out big loose clumps to all the soldiers.
It would be nice if there was some sort of historical record of it.
They should have a toilet-paper museum.
Would you like that?
So we could see all the toilet-paper advancements down through the ages.
Toilet paper during the Crusades.
The development of the perforation.
The first six-pack.
Excuse me, Jerry.
I'm Stu Schirmack.
I'm from NBC.
- Could we speak for a few moments?
- Sure.
- Hi.
Jay Crespi.
- Hello.
- C-R-E-S-P-I.
- That's right.
I'm unbelievable at spelling last names.
- Give give me a last name.
- I'm not George.
All right.
All right.
First of all that was a terrific show.
- Thank you very much.
- And And I just wanted to let you know that we've been discussing you at some of our meetings, and we'd be very interested in doing something.
- Really?
- So if you had an idea for, like a TV show for yourself, well, we'd just love to talk about it.
I'd be very interested in that.
Well, here.
Why don't you give us a call, and maybe we can develop a series.
Okay.
Great.
Thanks.
- It was very nice meeting you.
- Thank you.
- Nice meeting you.
- Nice meeting you.
- What was that all about?
- They said they were interested in me.
- For what?
- You know, TV show.
- Your own show?
- Yeah, I guess so.
They want you to do a TV show?
They want me to come up with an idea.
I mean, I don't have any ideas.
Come on.
How hard is that?
Look at all the junk that's on TV.
You want an idea?
Here's an idea.
You coach a gymnastics team in high school, and you're married.
Your son is not interested in gymnastics, and you're pushing him.
Why should I care if my son's into gymnastics?
- You're the teacher.
It's only natural.
- But gymnastics is not for everybody.
- I know, but he's your son.
- So what?
All right, forget that idea.
It's not for you.
Okay, okay.
I got it.
You run an antique store.
- Yeah.
And?
- And people come into the store and you get involved in their lives.
What person who runs an antique store gets involved in people's lives?
- Why not?
- So someone comes in to buy an old lamp, and suddenly I'm getting them out of a jam.
I could see if I was a pharmacist.
Because a pharmacist knows what's wrong with everybody.
Antiques are very popular right now.
- No, they're not.
They used to be.
- Oh, sure.
- Like you know.
- Oh, like you do.
And you're the manager of the circus.
- The circus?
- Oh, come on.
This is a great idea.
Look at the characters.
You got all these freaks in the show.
A woman with a mustache.
Who wouldn't tune in to see a woman with a mustache?
You got the tallest man in the world.
A guy who's just a head.
- I don't think so.
- Look the show isn't about the circus.
It's about watching freaks.
I don't think the network would go for it.
- Why not?
- I'm not pitching a show about freaks.
Oh, come on, Jerry.
You're wrong.
People, they wanna watch freaks.
This is a "can't miss".
- Kramer.
- Hello, Newman.
I got the helmet.
Go get the radar detector.
Okay.
I'll be back in a second.
You guys coming to my party?
- Yeah.
Sure.
- Of course.
- What's this about?
- We're making a trade.
I'm giving him my motorcycle helmet.
He's giving me his radar detector.
- I didn't know you have a motorcycle.
- Well, my girlfriend had one.
You have a girlfriend?
I had a girlfriend.
And she was pretty wild.
- I don't remember you with a girl.
- Nevertheless.
This is a pretty bad deal for Kramer.
A radar detector's worth much more than that helmet.
You're cheating him.
- Don't say anything.
- All right.
Hey, you know you're getting gypped over here.
Really.
Hey.
We had a deal.
Are you reneging out of the deal?
Are you reneging?
- That's a renege.
- Stop saying "reneging".
- Well, you're reneging.
- Okay, okay.
I'm not reneging.
All right.
Give it to me.
- All right, let go.
- Come on.
- Let go on three.
- Give me that.
Just give me that!
- Three.
- Here.
Idiots.
Thanks, buddy.
So long.
- Does that thing work?
- No.
I got a postcard from Elaine.
- Really?
- Yeah.
They're in London now.
They'll be back in a few weeks.
I can't believe she got involved with her shrink.
What about the TV show?
Got anything?
No.
Nothing.
Why don't they have salsa on the table?
What do you need salsa for?
Salsa is now the number-one condiment in America.
Do you know why?
Because people like to say "salsa".
Do you have any salsa?
We need more salsa.
Where is the salsa?
No salsa?
You know, it must be impossible for a Spanish person to order seltzer and not get salsa.
I wanted seltzer, not salsa.
Don't you know the difference between them?
You have the seltzer after the salsa.
This should be the show.
This is the show.
- What?
- This.
Just talking.
Yeah.
Right.
No, I'm really serious.
I think that's a good idea.
Just talking?
Well, what's the show about?
It's about nothing.
- No story?
- No, forget the story.
- You gotta have a story.
- Who says you gotta have a story?
Remember when we were waiting for that table in that Chinese restaurant?
That could be a TV show.
And who's on the show?
Who are the characters?
I could be a character.
- You?
- Yeah.
You base a character on me.
So on the show there's a character named George Costanza?
Yeah.
What?
There's something wrong with that?
I'm a character.
People are always saying to me, "You know, you're quite a character".
And who else is on the show?
Elaine could be a character.
Kramer.
Now, he's a character.
So everybody I know is a character on the show.
Right.
- And it's about nothing.
- Absolutely nothing.
So you're saying I go into NBC and tell them I got this idea for a show about nothing.
We go into NBC.
We?
Since when are you a writer?
What writer?
We're talking about a sitcom.
You wanna go with me to NBC?
Yeah, we really got something here.
- What do we got?
- An idea.
- What idea?
- An idea for the show.
- I still don't know what the idea is.
- It's about nothing.
- Right.
- Everybody's doing something.
We'll do nothing.
We go into NBC, tell them we got an idea for a show about nothing.
- Exactly.
- "What's your show about"?
- I say, "Nothing".
- There you go.
I think you may have something here.
So the show would be about my real life and one of the characters would be based on you.
No, I don't think so.
What do you mean, you don't you think so?
- I don't like it.
- I don't understand.
- What don't you like?
- I don't like the idea of a character based on me.
- Why not?
I don't know.
It just doesn't sit well.
You're my neighbor.
There's gotta be a character.
- That's your problem, buddy.
- I don't understand what the deal is.
Okay.
You can do it on one condition.
- Whatever you want.
- I get to play Kramer.
- You can't play Kramer.
- I am Kramer.
But you can't act.
- Okay, fine, we'll use Newman.
- Newman?
- Use me for what?
- Nothing.
What do you want?
Well, you'll never guess what happened to me today.
I was driving home on the Palisades Parkway when I look in the rearview mirror, and what did I see?
The fuzz.
And it's funny because my new radar detector was on, but I didn't hear a thing.
- Isn't that strange?
- Yeah, that's strange.
Because the radar detector, as I understand it, detects radar!
With a series of beeps and flashing lights.
But for some reason, I didn't hear a thing except for the sound of a police siren.
Well, that's queer, huh?
I want my helmet back!
You give me back my helmet, and pay for that ticket!
Oh, yeah, yeah.
You better think again, MoJumbo.
You gave me a defective detector.
- Jerry?
- Buyer beware.
Are you gonna give me back my helmet?
No, we had a deal.
There's no guarantees in life.
No, but there's karma, Kramer.
Karma Kramer?
And one more thing: I'm not coming to your party!
Salsa, seltzer.
Do you have any salsa?
No, not seltzer, salsa.
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.
You sure?
- You look a little pale.
- No, I'm fine.
I'm good.
Fine.
Very good.
- What, are you nervous?
- No, I'm not nervous.
I'm very good.
- I can't do this.
I can't do this.
- What?
I can't.
I've tried.
I'm here.
It's impossible.
- This was your idea.
- What idea?
I just said something.
I didn't know you were gonna listen to me!
Don't worry about it.
They're just TV executives.
They're men with jobs, Jerry!
They wear suits and ties.
They're married.
They have secretaries!
- I told you not to come.
- I need some water.
I gotta get some water.
- They'll give us water in there.
- Really?
That's pretty good.
- Oh, God, it's Joe Davola.
- Who?
This guy's a writer.
He's a total nut.
I think he goes to the same shrink as Elaine.
Oh, God, he saw me.
- Hello, Jerry.
- Hey, Joe!
How you doing?
You're under no obligation to shake my hand.
Oh, no.
Just a custom.
That's my friend, George.
You look good.
Why shouldn't I look good?
No.
No reason.
You do the karate, right?
Yeah, you wanna hit me?
- What are you doing here?
- I dropped a script off.
Good for you.
Well.
- You don't have to say anything.
- No - Hey, I guess I'll see you Sunday night.
- Why?
Kramer's party.
- Kramer's having a party?
- No.
No, he's not having a party.
He's doing something.
I don't know.
It's nothing.
He's not doing anything.
I thought Kramer and I were very close friends.
No, I'm sure you are.
I'm sure you're very close friends.
Very close.
Give my best to Hinckley.
- What was that?
- I can't believe what I did.
I didn't know Kramer didn't invite him.
I gotta call Kramer.
They're ready for you.
Okay.
Okay.
Look.
- You You do all the talking.
Okay?
- Oh, relax!
- Who are they?
- Yeah.
- They're not better than me.
- Of course not.
- Who are they?
- They're nobody.
- What about me?
- What about you?
- Why them?
Why not me?
- Why not you?
- I'm just as good as them.
- Better.
- You really think so?
- No.
The bit The bit I really liked was where the parakeet flew into the mirror.
That was funny.
The parakeet in the mirror.
That is a good one, Stu.
Yeah.
One of my favorites.
What about you, George?
Have you written anything we might know?
Well, possibly.
I I wrote an off-Broadway show.
La Cocina.
Actually, it was off-off Broadway.
It was a comedy about a Mexican chef.
It was It was very funny.
There was one great scene with the chef.
What was his name?
- Pepe.
- Oh, Pepe.
Yes, Pepe.
And he was making tamales.
Oh, he actually cooked on the stage?
No, no, he mimed it.
That's what was so funny about it.
So, what have you two come up with?
We thought about this in a variety of ways but the basic idea is I play myself - May I?
Go ahead.
I think I can sum up the show for you with one word: Nothing.
- Nothing?
- Nothing.
What does that mean?
The show is about nothing.
- It's not about nothing.
- No, it's about nothing.
Well, maybe in philosophy.
But even nothing is something.
Mr. Dalrymple, your niece is on the phone.
- I'll call back.
- D-A-L-R-l-M-P-E-L.
Not even close.
- Is that with a Y?
- No.
- What's the premise?
- As I was saying, I would play myself as a comedian living in New York and I have a friend and a neighbor and an ex-girlfriend.
- Which is all true.
- But nothing happens on the show.
You see, it's just like life.
You know, you eat, you go shopping, you read, you eat you read, you go shopping.
- You read?
You read on the show?
Well, I don't know about the reading.
We didn't discuss the reading.
All right, tell me about the stories.
- What kind of stories?
- Oh, no.
No stories.
No stories?
- So, what is it?
- What did you do today?
- I got up and came to work.
- There's a show.
That's a show.
How is that a show?
Well, maybe something happens to you on the way to work.
No.
No!
No!
Nothing happens!
Well, something happens.
- Well, why am I watching it?
- Because it's on TV.
Not yet.
Okay, look.
If you wanna just keep doing the same old thing then maybe this idea is not for you.
I, for one, am not going to compromise my artistic integrity.
And I'll tell you something else: This is the show, and we're not gonna change it.
Right?
How about this?
I manage a circus.
I don't even wanna talk about it anymore.
What were you thinking?
What was going on in your mind?
Artistic integrity.
Well, where did you come up with that?
You're not artistic, and you have no integrity.
You really need some help.
A regular psychiatrist couldn't even help you.
You need to go to, like, Vienna or something.
You know what I mean?
You need to get involved at the university level.
Like where Freud studied, and have people looking and checking up on you.
That's the kind you need.
Not the once-a-week for 80 bucks.
No.
You need a team.
A team of psychiatrists, working round the clock thinking about you, having conferences.
Observing you, like the way they did with the Elephant Man.
That's what I'm talking about.
That's the only way you're gonna get better.
I thought the woman was kind of cute.
Hold it.
I really wanna be clear about this.
Are you talking about the woman in the meeting?
Is that the woman you're talking about?
Yeah.
I thought I might give her a call.
I don't meet that many women.
I meet, like, three women a year.
I mean, we've been introduced.
She knows my name.
- It's completely inappropriate.
- Why?
Maybe she liked me.
I mean, she She was looking right at me.
I think she was impressed.
We had good eye contact through the whole meeting.
- Oh, I forgot to call Kramer.
- Wait a minute, let me call Susan.
- No, this is more important.
- She might leave work any minute.
No, I gotta warn him that I told Joe Davola about his party.
No!
What is it?
I was just thinking about this patient of mine.
What?
Just wondering if he's taking his medication.
Come on.
We're on vacation.
Well, we were standing in the waiting area there and you know how Davola is.
He's all - Yeah?
- It's George.
And so I felt very uncomfortable with him and, you know, I just blurted out something about your party.
- Back up a second.
- I didn't know that you didn't invite him.
Why would I invite him?
- Well, I just assumed that - Assumed?
Never assume anything.
I don't want that nut in my house.
You know he's on medication.
- Well, hello.
Oh, hello.
- Hello.
You remember Susan from NBC.
- Of course.
How are you?
- Fine.
Good to see you.
- This is Kramer.
- Hello.
All right, go ahead, Susan.
Tell him.
- Tell me what?
- Well, l I'm sorry.
Excuse me one second.
- Hello?
- Hi would you be interested in switching to TMI long distance?
Oh, l I can't talk right now.
Why don't you give me your home number, and I'll call you later?
I'm sorry.
We're not allowed to do that.
I guess you don't want people calling you at home.
- No.
- Well, now you know how I feel.
- So go ahead.
Tell him.
- Well Kramer, are you drinking that milk?
- Yeah.
- What's the expiration date on that?
September third.
- The third?
- The third?
Never should have brought her up there.
Should have known better.
I should have seen it coming.
I didn't see it coming.
I think she saw it coming.
You know, she was behind the idea.
She was gonna champion the show.
I was bringing her up to tell you, and she liked me.
Look, just because Kramer vomited on her doesn't mean the deal is dead.
What are you, crazy?
It's a traumatic thing to be thrown up on.
Vomiting is not a deal-breaker.
If Hitler had vomited on Chamberlain he still would have given him Czechoslovakia.
Chamberlain.
You could hold his head in the toilet, he'd still give you half of Europe.
What happened to you?
Davola came after me.
What?
Davola?
See, this guy is crazy.
I can't believe this.
What happened?
Can I get coffee?
You know, I was walking home I had to pick up my helmet from the shop.
I had to get a new strap.
So I had it on, and I was checking the strap out to make sure it fit.
And suddenly, I feel this kick hit me on the side of the head.
It knocks me down.
I look up, and it's Crazy Joe Davola.
And he says, "That's what I think of your party".
Boy, that is some kick.
Newman's helmet, it saved my life.
Look at that.
Wow, Newman's helmet.
I got bad news for you, buddy.
Davola says you're next.
Me?
Why?
He doesn't like you.
What does he want from me?
I didn't do anything.
See, this is all Elaine's fault.
She took off to Europe with his psychiatrist.
He can't get his medication.
Now I got some nut after me.
Pass the cream.
Wait a second.
All right.
When you vomit on somebody it is a social faux pas from which there is really no recovery.
At that point, there's really very little you can say to the person.
There's no Hallmark cards that cover this occasion.
There's no vomit sympathy-card section of the store, you know.
"You wear it well".
You know, there's no words that really capture, you know "Next time, lunch is on me".
There's no, really, way to phrase the sentiment.
Where the hell did I put it?
- Where did I put it?
- What are you looking for?
The remote.
The remote.
I can't find the remote.
Did l?
I lost it.
Did you take it?
- Did you put it someplace?
- No, no, no.
All right, what is this?
- What is what?
- All right, very funny.
I get it.
- You're in a weird mood.
- Come on.
Go to your apartment and fix it.
- Fix what?
- Your pants!
What is this?
Why do I got one pant leg on for?
Don't you know?
Look at your face.
You only shaved the right side of your face.
- What is this, a joke?
- No joke.
What?
A joke?
You think this is funny?
Well, look at your face in the mirror.
- Yeah?
- It's George.
Come on up.
- I don't believe this.
- You didn't know you were doing this?
No, I swear.
I'll bet this is from that kick from that Crazy Joe Davola.
You better see a doctor and get some x-rays.
Just the man I'm looking for.
- Me?
- Yeah.
Here you go.
- What's this?
- A dry-cleaning bill.
- From that woman at NBC?
- Yeah.
Dry cleaning bill for what?
For vomiting on her vest.
Oh, come on, George.
I didn't do that on purpose.
- I shouldn't have to pay.
- Neither should I. Jerry left the milk in the refrigerator.
- Yeah, it's your milk.
- He drank it.
- I didn't know.
- All right.
Well, we should all chip in, I guess.
- Yeah.
- How much was it to clean the vest?
Eighteen dollars.
Can you get vomit out of suede?
- I don't know.
- Yo-Yo Ma!
What?
Yo-Yo Ma?
What about him?
- You just said, "Yo-Yo Ma".
- What's Yo-Yo Ma?
He's a cellist.
You should see a doctor today.
All right.
Let's go.
Six dollars.
I can't believe she sent a cleaning bill.
I know.
And it doesn't really bode well for the show, does it?
Forget about the show.
We should take the idea to a different network.
Oh, yeah.
Right.
Like anybody's ever gonna do this.
How did you get me to go with that?
A show about nothing.
It was a good idea.
Susan liked it.
And if he hadn't vomited all over her, we'd be writing it right now.
What are you doing?
What's wrong with you?
What are you doing?
Give me that.
Go to your apartment and lie down.
I'll make an appointment for a doctor.
Hello?
Oh, hi, I'm sorry.
No, that's my neighbor.
He's not quite himself.
He got kicked in the head.
What?
Really?
You're kidding.
Today?
Yeah, sure.
We could make it.
Two o'clock?
Yeah, we could do that.
Okay.
Great.
Thanks a million.
Okay.
Bye.
- What?
- NBC.
They wanna have another meeting.
They wanna have another meeting?
They wanna buy it!
They wanna buy it!
What did I tell you?
We'll be rich!
What are we gonna get?
- Fifty, 60 thousand.
- I don't know about 60.
Oh, it's gotta be 50.
You know how much Ted Danson makes?
Ted Danson.
Now, how are you comparing us to Ted Danson?
- I didn't say we're Ted Danson.
- You did.
You said we're Ted Danson.
- You know, I think he wears a piece.
- Yeah, don't worry.
He can afford it.
- What time do you have?
- Five till.
See, I'm 10 minutes slow again.
That's it for this piece of junk.
I've had it.
- The one your parents gave you?
- It never works.
We're supposed to be there.
We should take a cab.
We'll be a little late.
I'm not taking a cab.
- I'll pay for it.
- It's not the money.
What is it you object to?
The comfort?
The speed?
The convenience?
Jerry!
- Uncle Leo!
- Hello!
Hello there.
How you doing?
- How are you?
How's Mom and Dad?
- Good.
Fine.
What, are you getting to be too much of a big shot now to give me a call?
I don't hear from you anymore.
Oh, no, I've been kind of busy, that's all.
You know where I just came from?
- Danny Barber.
- Oh, sure.
Danny.
He used to be in the pajama business.
Remember, I got my pajamas for free.
I used to come over and give you pajamas.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I remember.
Funny thing is, I can't wear them.
I get too hot.
I sleep in my underwear and a T-shirt.
If it gets too hot, I just take the T-shirt off.
Anyway, Danny says to me: - "You need any pajamas"?
- I'm sorry, Uncle Leo.
I really gotta get going.
Well, you gotta get going, so go.
We got a big meeting with the president of NBC.
- Nobody got a gun to your head.
- Yeah.
I'm really sorry.
Go.
Really, I understand.
You got an appointment.
Go to your appointment.
- I'm sorry.
Really.
- You know I know plenty of people in Hollywood too.
Sorry.
Really.
- Yeah?
- Come on, are you ready?
Let's go.
- For what?
- What's with you?
I just talked to you 15 minutes ago.
- About what?
- The courthouse.
You gotta go with me to court.
I'm contesting the ticket.
- I can't.
I'm going to the doctor's later.
- You gotta go.
You're my alibi.
You have to take the stand.
- Well, I can't.
- Well, let me remind you of something.
You wouldn't even be here today if it wasn't for me and my helmet.
I saved your life.
You would be dead!
You would cease to exist.
You'd be gone for the rest of eternity.
Can you even begin to comprehend what that means?
Shut up!
I'll get my coat.
Don't step on anything.
There are many things that I think you can point to as proof that the humans are not smart.
But my personal favorite would have to be that we had to invent the helmet.
What happened was we were involved in a lot of activities that were cracking our heads.
We chose not to avoid doing these activities, but instead to come up with some sort of device to help us continue enjoying our head-cracking lifestyles: The helmet.
Not enough people were wearing them so we had to come up with the helmet law which is even stupider.
The idea behind the helmet law is to preserve a brain whose judgment is so poor it does not even try to stop the cracking of the head it's in.
Did you see the look on his face?
Did you see how insulted he was?
What could I do?
What are we supposed to do?
You can't leave.
There's no excuse good enough to justify walking away from a conversation with one of my relatives.
I didn't shave this morning.
I don't feel like myself.
You could be a fireman on a fire truck on the way to a fire.
You bump into one of my relatives, "Sorry, Uncle Leo there's a building full of people burning down.
I do have to be running".
He'll go, "Go.
Go ahead.
Go to your fancy fire.
If that's what you have to do".
- Look at this.
- Why didn't you shave this morning?
Because I shaved yesterday in the afternoon.
- Why?
- Because of the day before.
It's a long story.
I can't get back on schedule.
Is that Joe Davola?
It's not him!
I can't live like this.
I'm being stalked.
Mr. Seinfeld.
They're ready for you.
Mr. Seinfeld.
What about Mr. Costanza?
I'm not here?
All right.
You promised.
You're gonna be a little more flexible on the nothing idea.
- Just a little.
- All right.
A little.
Okay.
You all set?
You got your story?
- No.
- When he stopped me I told him I was rushing because my friend was about to commit suicide.
Now, you're that friend.
All we need is a reason why you were gonna commit suicide.
I never had an air conditioner.
No.
That's no reason to kill yourself.
Why?
It gets hot at night.
You can't sleep.
You ever try to sleep in a hot room?
I sleep in a really hot room.
I don't wanna kill myself.
I've slept in really hot rooms, and I wanted to kill myself.
No, no, that's not gonna work.
Something else.
I was never able to become a banker.
Banker!
So you're killing yourself because your dreams of becoming a banker have gone unfulfilled.
You You You can't live without being a banker.
Yeah, yeah.
If I can't be a banker, I don't wanna live.
- You must be a banker!
- Must be a banker!
Okay, we'll go with the banker story.
Story is the foundation of all entertainment.
You must have a good story.
Otherwise, it's just masturbation.
And people really have to care about the characters.
Care?
Forget about care.
Love.
They have to love them.
Otherwise why tune in?
- Wouldn't tune in.
- Would they tune in?
- No tune.
We like to look at a show as if it were an EKG.
You have your highs and your lows.
And it goes up and down.
This show will be like a heart attack.
Just a huge, massive coronary.
So, what you said last week about no story you're a little flexible on that now.
Is that what I said, "no story"?
Because Jerry had to tell me later.
He couldn't believe it.
I said I said, "Get out of here.
No story?
Is that what I said"?
Well, I informed him that he was exceeding the speed limit and that's when he told me that he was racing home because his friend was about to commit suicide.
And then what happened?
He became very loud and hysterical.
He was flailing his arms about as he told the story and then he threw himself on the ground and he grabbed me around the legs and he begged me to let him go.
And when I refused that's when he began to scream, "My friend's going to die.
My friend's going to die".
I don't know how you guys feel, but we would like to be in business with you.
- We would like to be in business.
- Love to be in business.
- We'll do business.
- Business.
- Let's have business.
- This is business.
Would it be possible to get a copy of La Cocina?
Your off-Broadway play.
Gee, you know It's It's the damndest thing.
l I moved recently, and my files disappeared.
Now l I don't know if they fell off the truck or if there was some foul play, but let me tell you: I am not through with that moving company.
That's my vow to you.
Well, I got a feeling about you two.
And even more than that I place great confidence in this lady's judgment.
- Good judgment.
- Good judgment.
- That's a pile of judgment.
- Yes.
Yes, judgment with earrings on.
So let's make a pilot.
I had gone up to Westchester.
I go every Tuesday.
I do charity work with the blind in my spare time for the Lighthouse.
I was in the middle of a game of Parcheesi with an old blind man and I excused myself to call my friend as he was very depressed lately because he never became a banker.
I don't understand.
You see, it had been his lifelong dream to be a banker, and he Just the day before, he was turned down by a bank.
I believe it was the Manufacturers Hanover on Lexington and 40th Street.
That was the third bank in two weeks to turn him down so I was I was a little concerned.
I wanted to see how he was doing.
Well, Your Honor, he was barely audible but l I distinctly recall him saying Hey, Yo-Yo Ma.
So I sped home to save my friend's life, and I was stopped for speeding.
Yes, I admit I was speeding but it was to save a man's life.
A close friend.
An innocent person who wanted nothing more out of life than to love to be loved and to be a banker.
So then he didn't kill himself?
No, sir, he did not.
But only by the grace of God.
He is in the courtroom today, sitting right over there!
And he can corroborate my entire testimony.
See!
Told you!
I told you!
- Now all we gotta do is write it.
- Yes!
How are we gonna do that?
- Hey!
Congratulations.
- Thanks.
- Thank you.
Thanks.
- Thank you.
You know, I thought you were mad at me.
Mr. Seinfeld, you have a telephone call.
Phone call?
Who knows I'm here?
Hello?
Mom?
How did you know I was here?
Oh, I was not rude to him.
That is baloney!
I couldn't talk.
I had a meeting.
I don't know.
He He went off on some thing about pajamas.
When you sent me the bill, I thought the show didn't have a chance.
Oh, it was only vomit.
Anyway, I would like to pay for the dry cleaning.
- Oh, no, no.
It's okay.
- Oh, no, no, no.
We all chipped in.
We have the money.
Well, it was $ 18.
- Okay, $ 18.
There it is.
There you go.
- All right.
So maybe we could get together this weekend.
- Yeah.
Call me.
- All right.
Great.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Thanks.
Bye.
I can't believe she took the money.
Why?
I offered to pay.
She should have said no.
She did.
You insisted.
This is what the pilot should be about.
Vomiting on somebody's vest.
How much are we gonna get for this?
- Oh, l I don't know.
- We gotta get 50.
Gotta get 50.
We'll go.
You call your manager.
Maybe they made an offer.
- Okay.
- All right, let's go, let's go.
Thirteen thousand?
Thirteen thousand.
- Apiece?
- No, for both.
That's insulting.
Ted Danson makes $800,000 an episode.
- Would you stop with the Ted Danson?
- Well, he does.
- You're nuts.
- I'm sorry.
I can't live knowing that Ted Danson makes that much more than me.
- Who's he?
- He's somebody.
- What about me?
- You're nobody.
- Why him?
Why not me?
- He's good.
You're not.
- I'm better than him.
- You're worse.
Much, much worse.
- There's Davola.
- What?
Where?
- Where?
- Outside.
I just saw him outside.
What is it?
Oh, it's this patient.
Again?
I'm fairly certain.
I forgot to leave him an extra prescription for his medication.
Well, so he can live without his Valium for a couple of days.
No, you don't understand.
He could be dangerous.
Go outside and see if he's there.
I can't go.
He knows we're friends.
Well, what am I supposed to do?
I gotta take Kramer to the doctor.
- Tell the cop.
- Good idea.
Excuse me, officer.
There's a guy outside, and he's a nutjob, and he's waiting to beat me up.
If you could just walk me outside and wait till I get into a cab.
Yeah, all right.
Just Just let me get a muffin.
Thanks.
He's gonna get a muffin.
Then he'll walk us outside.
This is a great way to go through life, isn't it?
Hey, he's looking at the menu now.
What's he looking at the menu for?
I thought you said he was gonna get a muffin.
What are you doing?
- What?
- What, you're ordering food now?
Yeah.
Yeah, I decided to get a sandwich.
What happened to the muffin?
I got a little hungry.
All of a sudden you get hungry?
Yeah.
You got a problem with that?
No.
Enjoy your lunch.
You know, a muffin can be very filling.
- He's getting a sandwich now.
- I thought he was gonna have a muffin.
All of a sudden, he gets hungry.
- You know, a muffin can be very filling.
- I know.
Mr. Kramer you heard the testimony so far.
Would you please tell the court, in your own words what happened on the afternoon of September 10th?
What do you mean, "in my own words"?
Whose words are they gonna be?
You know what I mean.
- I was very upset that day.
- And why was that?
- Would you let me say?
Let me talk.
- All right.
Go ahead.
- All right.
- Okay.
I was very upset that day because I could never become a banker.
And this failure to become a banker was eating at you.
Eating, eating, eating at you inside.
Yeah.
It was your family that pushed you into banking.
It was their dream for you.
- Mr. Newman?
- I'm trying to establish Mr. Kramer's fragile emotional state.
My entire case depends on it.
Continue.
- As you were saying, Mr. Kramer?
- What was the question?
You're telling how your parents pushed you into banking.
Well, my father, when I was a kid he took me to the bank and he lifted me up, and he pointed to the teller, and he said: "Sonny boy, take a good look at him.
That's gonna be you someday".
But you never became a banker, did you, Mr. Kramer?
Why?
Why did you fail?
I don't know.
Because you hated your father and you would do anything to displease him!
Isn't that true?
- Could you get to the speeding?
- Yes, I intend to, Your Honor.
And then, on the afternoon of September 10th you received a phone call, did you not?
Phone call?
Yes, a phone call.
From who?
- From me.
- From you?
Yes, from me!
From me!
I called you, remember?
- You called me?
- Yes, I called you, you idiot!
Because you were going to - You were going to Remember?
- What?
You were gonna You were gonna You were gonna do something to yourself.
You were gonna do something.
Remember the banking!
The banking!
It wasn't working out.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to call - Yes, a banker!
- What banker?
You're a banker!
- Your Honor - That's enough, Mr Mr. Kramer is obviously very distraught.
- I'm distraught?
- You shut up!
I demand a recess so that I can take him outside and help him regain his composure.
That'll be $ 75.
What's the matter with you, you jerk?
We had it all worked out!
Is he out there?
Do you see him?
I'm not sure.
Well, either you see him or you don't.
All right, I don't.
What is he doing?
Is he getting coffee?
I think he's getting coffee.
What's with this guy?
Did you just order coffee?
- Yeah.
- This is really too much.
- What is your problem?
- I'm sitting over there waiting for you to finish for 20 minutes.
Now you're drinking coffee.
That's another 10 minutes.
Well, you're just gonna have to wait.
You never said anything about the banking.
- You're off your rocker!
- Hey, you guys.
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?
- Is Davola outside?
- Davola?
- Yeah.
- No, I didn't see him.
- Crazy Joe Davola?
- Jerry, yours is $ 11.
- Eleven dollars?
For what?
Muffin, sandwich and coffee.
Hey, NBC okayed our idea.
We're gonna make the pilot.
The circus freak show?
- No.
- A pilot?
What do you make for something like that?
Fifty, 60 thousand?
What's the difference?
The money's not important.
- Hey, Newman, is that your red car?
- Yeah.
- I think you're getting a ticket.
- Run.
- Go!
Go!
Go!
- Hey, what are you doing?
It's after 6:00!
You can't give me a ticket!
You're not gonna get away with this.
I'll fight this.
- I've got witnesses.
- I saw the whole thing.
This would be a good idea for the pilot.
Get out of here.
The vomiting is funnier.
Oh, like you know.
No.
You do.
Many states now have traffic school when you have an infraction.
I went to traffic school.
I didn't mind it.
I felt bad for the instructor.
This guy goes to traffic school every day, no matter how he drives.
What is his incentive to not speed?
He's going to traffic school, anyway.
Why not get a racecar, do 200 miles an hour down the street?
Cop stops you.
"Where you going"?
"Traffic school".
"Go ahead.
And you better hurry.
You really need it".
The punishment should be, instead of traffic school or traffic court, just traffic.
They sentence you to 100 hours of traffic.
Five people drive all around you at five miles an hour wherever you go.
You're on your way to Vegas.
There isn't a car in sight.
Come on, move it.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 5}
My parents had two arguments while they were driving over either how fast my father was going or how much gas was left in the tank.
My father had a standard defense for either one of these.
It was always, "That's because you're looking at it from an angle.
If you were over here It looks from where you're sitting it looks like I'm doing 90 on empty.
But that's because you're over there.
If you were over here, you'd know I'm in the driveway with a full tank".
George and I went up to NBC, and we told them the idea for the series.
- We're waiting to sign the contract.
- They liked the idea?
- Yeah.
- What, you got leather seats here?
- Since when is George a writer?
- What writer?
It's a sitcom.
This is exciting.
When are you gonna sign the contract?
Soon.
There's a few problems.
I wanna tell you, that meal was the worst.
What do you expect?
It's airline food.
They give you that fish.
How could you eat fish on a plane?
Because she puts up a stink every time I have a piece of meat.
What kind of problems?
Well, George doesn't think $ 13,000 is enough money.
What?
He's not even working.
George is right.
Those people will try to get away with murder.
Believe me, they're all crooks.
- Jerry, I want you to sign that contract.
- We're gonna sign it.
In fact, George is out with the woman from NBC right now.
So I'm afraid we're gonna have to pass.
- You're passing?
- Well, it's much too low.
Are you and Jerry in agreement on this?
Yeah, we've talked.
I believe I can speak for the both of us on this.
You know, because this is your first show, it's a pretty standard deal.
- Standard?
- Yeah.
Is Ted Danson's deal standard?
- Ted Danson?
- You know, the guy from Cheers.
Yeah, I know who he is.
You're not Ted Danson.
I didn't say I was Ted Danson.
- All right, I'll tell Russell tomorrow.
- You tell Russell.
Oh, before I forget.
Cuban cigars.
It's a present from my father.
Do I have to write him a note or something?
- I'm sure he'd appreciate that.
- What would I say in the note?
You're a writer.
You'll think of something.
Oh, yeah.
I'm a writer.
I forgot.
Were you waiting long at the gate?
I don't even know.
Where's that watch we bought you?
Oh That's it for this piece of junk.
I've had it.
- Is it the one your parents gave you?
- It never works.
It's being fixed.
I got a guarantee on that watch.
Give it to me.
I'll take it back.
- It's at the jeweler.
- You send me the bill.
I'm not sending it.
That watch was a gift.
You shouldn't have to pay for it.
- That's $ 18.50.
- Here, I got it.
What are you talking about?
It's my car.
Let me pay.
- No, no, put it away.
- Dad.
- Stop it.
- I have money.
I make money.
- Yeah, yeah, you make money.
- You don't think I make money.
- I don't think that.
- You do.
That's what you both think.
- I'm paying.
- Dad, I'm paying.
- Get out.
- You're not paying.
- Jerry, do not do this.
- No, no.
Over my dead body, Jerry.
I'm telling you right now you're not gonna do it.
Boy, you got a lot of stuff here.
- Dad, what are you doing?
- Nothing, nothing.
Leave it.
What about your back?
- Morty, what are you doing?
- All right, all right.
You come here to see a back specialist and you're lifting heavy suitcases.
Hey, Morty.
Hey, Mr. Kramer.
- Hey, Mrs. Seinfeld.
- Kramer, hi.
What happened to you?
Oh, some guy kicked me in the side of the head.
- What guy?
- Crazy Joe Davola.
- Why?
- Well, I was having this party and I didn't invite him, and then Jerry tipped him off.
Why did you tell this guy that Kramer didn't invite him to his party?
I didn't know he wasn't invited.
Hey, these are very comfortable pants.
You know what I paid for these, Jerry?
- So why did you say anything?
- It was a mistake.
They're good around the house, and they're good for outside.
- Are you okay?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
I was little off last week, huh, Jerry?
But the doctor says it's just a slight concussion.
What's the matter with this Davola guy?
He's got, like, a chemical imbalance.
- He needs to be on medication.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
He's after Jerry now.
- Kramer.
- He's what?
- He's joking.
- He's after you?
- No.
- Why's he after you?
He's not after me.
Morty, do you hear this?
Some crazy guy is after Jerry.
- I'll make a few phone calls.
- Who you gonna call?
What are you worried about?
I wanna know what you did to this guy.
- I didn't do anything.
- You must've done something.
No, he just doesn't like me.
Doesn't like you?
How could anyone not like you?
- I know, it seems impossible.
- Doesn't Doesn't like you?
How could that be?
Ma, this may be hard for you to understand but I'm sure there are many people who do not like me.
Jerry, don't say that.
- It's true.
- No, it isn't.
It's not true.
You're a wonderful, wonderful boy.
Everybody likes you.
It's impossible not to like you.
Morty?
Maybe some people don't like him.
I can see that.
- Kramer?
- Yeah, I like him.
Hey, Jerry, what time you got?
I haven't got my watch on.
It's being fixed.
When are you getting it back?
- Next week.
- Next week?
How come it's taking so long?
I said, how come it's taking so long?
I don't know.
They're backed up.
Wait a minute.
Where did you take it?
- Where did I take it?
- Yeah.
Where did I take it?
To that place on Columbus and 85th, okay?
What, Jimmy Sherman?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I know the guy.
I take my stuff in there.
I can get your watch back by tomorrow morning.
No, I don't want you to say anything to him.
I'd be happy to.
He's a friend of mine.
I'd like to follow the regular procedures.
I don't want any special treatment.
Hey, I'm gonna get that watch back for you by tomorrow, buddy.
- Bring me the receipt.
- I'll get that too.
Be right back.
Look, there's no watch.
I threw it in the garbage can on the street.
My parents gave it to me, but I didn't like it.
So don't mention it again, okay?
- Yeah, all right.
- All right.
Wait, wait Well, no What was that about?
Oh, no he's got my calamine lotion.
I told him not to return it.
If he needs it, he should keep it.
He's got a thing on his ankle.
How could anyone not like him?
Hi.
Morty Seinfeld.
I have a 2:00 appointment.
Yes, Mr. Seinfeld.
Would you please fill this out?
All this?
This whole thing?
It's gonna take me 45 minutes.
I know, it's very long.
Look at this.
It's a book.
"Employer's address".
Why do they need this?
I never had a back problem until that night I slept on the convertible sofa.
- My back was fine.
- Oh, it's not the sofa.
You stick up for that sofa like I'm criticizing a person.
We got it from Sullivan's.
It's a good store.
Well, one day somebody's gonna sleep on that thing, and we'll get sued.
I hope this doctor knows what he's doing.
Leo says he's the best there is.
Leo.
I'm listening to Leo now.
You're lucky he got you this.
You know what the waiting list is?
Well, if he fixes my back, I'll be happy.
Have you ever had a sexually transmitted disease?
That's it.
Here, you got my name, you got my address.
That's enough.
Julie, you wanna take him back?
You what?
You passed?
How could you do that?
Jerry, my young friend you're so naive.
You are so, so naive.
You know about a few things.
You know about comedy a little bit about relationships, some baseball but you're so far out of your element here, you're embarrassing yourself.
Now, listen to me.
I'm negotiating.
Negotiation.
This is what you do in business.
Let me explain to you what you just did.
There are literally hundreds of people trying to get pilot deals with them.
They go with maybe five, okay?
If we pass, that's it.
They go to the next show.
I'm scared.
Oh, they're not gonna do the show.
We're lucky they're even interested in the idea in the first place.
We got a show about nothing.
With no story.
Do you think they're going, "Maybe we should give those two guys who have no experience and no idea, more money"?
Oh, what are we gonna do?
I'm shaking.
I'm shaking.
- I think you're wrong.
- We'll just see.
- Yes, we will.
- Yes, we will.
- I just said that.
- I know.
- Good for you.
- Good for you.
- Are you repeating everything?
- Are you repeating everything?
- Well, George is an idiot.
- Well, George All right.
All right.
Let's go already!
They keep you in here a year.
They don't give a damn.
I could die in here.
Excuse me.
Excuse me!
What's going on?
I'm in here 20 minutes.
Can somebody please help me?
- Quiet.
Everyone can hear you.
- I've been waiting 20 minutes.
Well, the doctor must be busy.
Well, why do they make appointments for if they can't keep them?
Look, if I did that in my business, I wouldn't have made a nickel.
Hello, Mr. Seinfeld.
- I thought you forgot about me.
- We didn't forget.
- What's wrong?
- The Velcro.
I can't stand Velcro.
That tearing sound.
I used to be in raincoats.
I refused to put that in any of my lines.
Okay, Mr. Seinfeld, please come this way.
We need some x-rays.
- Leave all my stuff here?
- Leave it.
Oh, hey, by the way do you want a box of Cuban cigars?
I smoked one last night.
I got nauseous.
No, I don't want them.
I'll take it.
No, I'll take it.
What is it?
- Here you go.
- What, cigars?
- Yeah, Cubans.
- Oh, yeah?
Yeah, the kind that Castro smoked.
You can't buy them anywhere.
Castro, huh?
- Yeah?
- Federal Express.
Federal Express?
Come on up.
Federal Express?
I'm not expecting a package.
You know what you just did?
You let a burglar in the building.
- You think so?
- Federal Express?
Of course.
That's the oldest trick in the book.
It might not be a burglar.
It could be a murderer.
So you wanna just abolish all home-package delivery?
Yes, it's dangerous.
Wait.
- Who is it?
- Federal Express.
Okay.
Hi, Kramer.
Oh, God.
I thought you were in California.
- Well, I came back for you.
- Oh, shut up.
- I missed you.
- Really?
- You really missed me?
- Yeah.
Me too, miss.
I miss.
Yeah, big missing going on around here.
Hey, I'm gonna get a match.
Oh, God.
Whose suitcase is this?
My parents'.
My father came up to see a back specialist.
Oh, God.
It's probably from sleeping on that sofa.
- Boy, you look really great.
- Yeah.
- You lie.
- No, no, you really look great.
So tell us about the trip.
How's Dr. Reston?
Oh, he's fine.
- Things are good?
- Yeah, you know.
- What?
- Did you see that?
Yeah, I saw it.
- What?
- It's a tell.
You got a tell.
What tell?
What's a tell?
When you ask about their relationship and they touch their face you know it's not going too well.
Go ahead.
Ask me how it's going with somebody.
- How's it going with Alice?
- Good, going good.
The higher up on the face you go, the worse the relationship is getting.
You know, it's like: Pretty good.
Not bad.
I gotta get out.
- How high did I go?
- You almost did the nose.
Are you eating my peanut butter out of the jar with your disgusting fingers?
This is a sickening display.
What, I'm not eating bread now.
I'm off bread.
You're off bread.
- So, what happened?
Is it over?
- No, not quite.
- Why not?
- He was my psychiatrist, you know.
I mean, he knows all my patterns.
He knows in relationships I always find some reason to leave.
So he says, as my doctor, he can't allow me do this so he's not letting me leave.
- What do you mean, not letting you?
- He has this power over me, okay?
He has this way of manipulating every little word that I say.
He's like a Svenjolly.
Svengali.
- What did I say?
- Svenjolly.
Svenjolly?
I did not say, Svenjolly.
- George?
- Svenjolly.
I don't see how I could've said, Svenjolly.
Maybe he's got, like, a cheerful mental hold on you.
- I can't find a match anywhere.
- You know what you should do?
Tell this guy you're seeing somebody else.
That's the easiest way.
No, it's not gonna work with this guy.
You just tell him an old boyfriend's come back into your life.
I don't think so.
- Nice try.
- Took a shot.
This is a good cigar.
So when do I get to see the doctor?
He'll be in with the x-rays in a few minutes.
You can get dressed.
He stole my wallet.
The bum stole my wallet.
My wallet's gone!
My wallet's gone!
I had my wallet in my back pocket.
It's gone.
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.
I went in to get my x-rays.
Somebody takes my wallet.
Is that the operation?
Mr. Seinfeld, I'm Dr. Dembrow.
I've been going over your x-rays.
I'm not interested in the x-rays.
I want my money back.
Somebody stole my wallet.
I had $225 in there.
- I don't see how that happened.
- Oh, you don't see.
You don't see.
Well, it happened.
Believe me.
- What's going on?
- They stole my wallet.
- What?
- Yeah, while I was in getting x-rayed.
All right, Mr. Seinfeld, I am sorry about your wallet.
Would you like me to look over the x-rays?
- What kind of joint you running here?
- All right.
Fine.
At least you could've heard your diagnosis.
I'm not interested in his diagnosis.
He's a bum.
You came all the way from Florida to see him.
I wanna know what kind of office this is where you can't leave your pants.
You tell me.
I'm sorry, but there's somebody else.
Well, it's nothing I planned on happening, you know.
It just kind of happened.
- Tell me about him.
- Well, there's not really much to tell.
You know, he's just a guy, really.
- Yes, well, I assume he's a guy.
- Right.
And you've known him how long?
Years.
Many years.
We've been close friends, and then recently, something just, you know happened.
- You mean sexually?
- Yeah, yeah.
Sexually.
I think your Excuse me.
Yes?
Oh, yes, Bobo.
No, it's just east of Madison.
Around 4 will be fine.
All right, Bobo, see you then.
I'm sorry.
Where were we?
Well, I was just telling you about this other guy.
Elaine, do you remember your dream where you had a sexual encounter with a Chinese woman?
Yeah, yeah.
Elaine, I'm concerned about you.
Oh, no.
Don't concern yourself with me, because I'm good.
I'm very good.
I mean, I'm really very, very good.
Elaine have you been urinating a lot again?
No.
And how often have you been seeing I'm sorry.
What is his name?
- His name?
- Yes, his name.
- Well, what's the difference?
- Are you afraid to tell me his name?
No, I just don't really see how that's relevant.
It doesn't matter if you don't see how.
I see how.
His name.
I don't even know.
You wanna know his name?
I'll tell you his name.
His name is Kramer.
Kramer.
Is that his first name or his last name?
You know, I'm really uncomfortable talking about this.
- Elaine, I want you to do me a favor.
- What?
I want you to tell this young man to give me a call.
- It's very important that I speak to him.
- Oh, no, no, I can't do that.
- You can do it, and you will do it.
- No, I can't.
You can, and you will.
Okay.
Okay, yeah, I'll have Kramer give you a call.
So you didn't even let the doctor treat you?
I wouldn't give him the satisfaction.
Why did you leave your wallet in your pants?
What are you talking about?
What, was I supposed to hide it?
- You could've taken it with you.
- Yeah.
I'll be lying on an x-ray table with my wallet in my mouth.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Hi, Uncle Leo.
I just spoke to Dr. Dembrow's son.
He said they almost had to call the police.
What?
I'm the one who should've called the police.
They stole my wallet.
You know how hard it was for me to get that appointment for you?
You can't just walk in on this guy.
He did me a personal favor.
- All right, Leo.
- And you walked out without paying.
How was I supposed to pay?
I didn't have my wallet.
Well, I hope you send him a check.
- What for?
- What for?
This man was nice enough to see you.
He did me a personal favor.
That's the second time you said personal favor.
Why do you say that?
- I said it once.
- Twice.
And Dembrow doesn't even know you.
His son happens to live on your floor.
Leo, where did you get that watch?
You know where I got this?
I found it in the garbage can.
It kept terrible time.
I brought it over to Jimmy Sherman right here on 85th and Columbus.
Gave it to me back the next day, works great.
What kind of an idiot throws away a perfectly good watch?
Doesn't that watch look like the one that we gave Jerry?
Hey, where's the waiter?
Dad, let's have some red meat.
- Let's live a little.
- Let me see that.
Could we continue this another time?
Don't you hate "to be continueds" on TV?
It's horrible when you sense the "to be continued" coming, you know.
You're watching the show.
You're into the story.
There's five minutes left, and you realize: "Hey, they can't make it.
Timmy's still stuck in the cave.
There's no way they wrap this up in five minutes".
I mean, the whole reason you watch a TV show is because it ends.
If I wanted a long boring story with no point to it, I have my life.
A comedian can't do that, see?
I can't go, "A man walks into a bar with a pig.
Can you come back next week"?
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Here's what happened last week.
George and I went up to NBC, and we told them the idea for the series.
We're waiting to sign the contract.
- Jerry, I want you to sign that contract.
- We're gonna sign it.
In fact, George is out with the woman from NBC right now.
I'm afraid we're gonna have to pass.
- You're passing?
- Well, it's much too low.
That's it for this piece of junk.
I've had it.
- Is it the one your parents gave you?
- It never works.
- Where's that watch we bought you?
- It's at the jeweler.
I would like somebody to hit me.
What's the matter with this Davola guy?
He's after Jerry now.
I never had a back problem until that night I slept on the convertible sofa.
Cuban cigars.
It's a present from my father.
- Here you go.
- What, cigars?
Yeah, Cubans.
- What's wrong?
- The Velcro.
I can't stand Velcro.
That tearing sound.
Now, listen to me.
I'm negotiating.
Negotiation.
This is what you do in business.
- Leave all my stuff here?
- Leave it.
Tell us about the trip.
How's Dr. Reston?
He has this power over me, okay?
He has this way of manipulating every little word that I say.
He's like a Svenjolly.
Tell this guy you're seeing somebody else.
That's the easiest way.
His name is Kramer.
I want you to tell this young man to give me a call.
My wallet's gone!
My wallet's gone!
Where did you get that watch?
I found it in the garbage can.
What kind of an idiot throws away a perfectly good watch?
It's an entire industry of bad gifts, all those executive gifts.
Any stupid, goofy, brass, wood thing.
They put a piece of green felt on the bottom.
"It's a golf, desk, tie and stress organizer, Dad".
Well, to me, nothing compares with the paperweight as a bad gift.
There's no better way than a paperweight to express to someone that, "I refuse to put any thought into this at all".
Where are these people working that papers are blowing right off of desks?
Are the desks screwed to the back of a flatbed truck going down the highway?
Are they typing in the crow's-nest of a clipper ship?
What do you need a paperweight for?
I don't understand this jeweler, Jimmy Sherman.
He brings a watch, takes over a week to fix it.
He fixed yours in one day.
Oh, you know these jewelers.
They're enigmas.
They're mysteries wrapped in a riddle.
- She's very attractive.
- She's okay.
- Just okay?
- She's nice.
- She's better than nice.
- She's all right.
- She's beautiful.
- She's not beautiful.
- I think she's beautiful.
- So you ask her out.
- I'm not gonna ask her out.
- Why not?
If you don't think she's beautiful, something's wrong.
She's pretty.
She's not beautiful.
I should drop dead if she's not beautiful.
- I think that's a little extreme.
- She's all right.
Two exact same watches.
He tells you a week and him a day.
How could that be?
Something's fishy about this.
He said what?
- "The hell with them".
- "The hell with them"?
- Those were his exact words.
- Oh, boy.
He said, "We've got 500 shows to choose from.
Why should we give two guys with no idea or experience more money"?
He was pretty emphatic?
- He pounded on his desk.
- He pounded?
I told you to take the offer.
Look, I had nothing to do with this.
It wasn't my decision.
It was Jerry.
Jerry told me.
I'm the creative guy.
- He handles the business end.
- You said it was insulting.
I was quoting him.
Why would I be insulted?
I'm never insulted.
You could call me "baldy," dump soup on my head.
Nothing insults me.
- Well, there's nothing I can do.
- Don't they make a counteroffer?
How can he just cancel the deal?
What kind of a maniac is this guy?
- He just says no, and that's it?
- Yeah, that's the way Russell is.
- He doesn't like to play games.
- He has to play.
He can't not play.
We're playing.
I gotta see him.
How do I get in touch with him?
- You'll have to wait till Monday.
- No.
I can't wait till Monday.
That's impossible.
I gotta talk to him now.
Where does he live?
I can't give you his address.
- Give me that address.
- Hey, give me that!
He just wants to talk to you.
I couldn't talk him out of it.
So you just tell him that you're my boyfriend and that we're in love, okay?
- Can you do that?
- Yeah, I'm your boyfriend.
Yeah.
- Okay.
- Have we been intimate?
Yeah.
Yeah, we've been intimate.
All right, how often do we do it?
Kramer, how is that important?
Honestly, do you really think he's going to ask?
- He's a psychiatrist.
They're interested in stuff like that.
All right.
All right.
We do it five times a week, okay?
- Oh, baby.
- Oh, my All right, listen.
- Just tell me what you'll say.
- I know what to say.
- No, but I would like to hear it.
- I don't wanna say it out loud.
It kills the spontaneity.
You know, Gleason, he never rehearsed.
- Go ahead.
Do it.
- Okay.
You talk to him.
- I'll talk to him.
- Hey, how's your hair?
Well, yeah, it's good.
You're not the type who should be playing with matches, seriously.
Yes.
Dr. Reston.
Is he in?
Well, this is Kramer, and he's expecting my call.
- Is he?
- Yes, yes, Dr. Reston.
Well, hello there.
- Well, I'm a good friend of Elaine's.
- No, no, not friends.
We're actually We're not friends.
We're much more than friends.
And I'm afraid we have a bit of a problem.
Well, the point is doctor, I'm very much in love with Elaine and she's very much in love with me, and, well we would appreciate it if you would cease and desist and allow us to pursue our courtship unfettered.
If not, I can assure you, doctor, that I can make things unpleasant for you and your staff, if you have one.
Yes.
Yeah, but the point that l Well, no.
Well, yeah, that's It's possible.
Well, I suppose I could, but I'd have to shift a few things around.
Wait.
Hold on for a second, will you?
Go ahead.
Yeah.
All right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, okay.
I look forward to it too.
Okay, so long.
What happened?
What did he say?
What's going on?
- Okay, he wants to get together.
- Get together?
- Why?
- You know, he wants to talk.
Why didn't you just say no?
That's interesting.
- Did you enjoy your croissant?
- It was different.
- And how was yours?
- Oh, very good.
Try our mousse.
It'll change your life expectancy.
No, thanks.
Just the check.
What's the matter with you?
- What?
- Why didn't you didn't flirt?
- Come on.
- She was flirting with you.
- Why didn't you say something?
- What would I say?
- You just sat there.
- Well, you made me uncomfortable.
You're a comedian.
Couldn't you come up with something?
- Where's the bathroom?
- In the back, on your right.
- Dad.
- Will you stop it.
Jerry, let go.
- Jerry.
- Would you let me pay just once?
- You're out of your mind.
- You don't even have a wallet.
- Don't worry about it.
- What'll you do?
What's the difference?
We'll figure it out.
- You're not paying.
- All right, fine.
You figure it out.
I'd be curious to know how you pick up a check with no money.
Because if this works, the whole monetary system's obsolete.
We're back to wampum.
I'm going to the bathroom.
How the hell am I gonna pay for this?
They give you some portion here, huh?
Uncle Leo, I hope I wasn't rude that day I bumped into you on the street.
- I really did have to get to a meeting.
- Oh, no, no, I understand.
I got plenty of friends in show business.
I know you're all very busy.
So you found that watch in a garbage can, huh?
Yeah.
In fact, it was right after I ran into you.
You know, a friend of mine has a watch just like that.
I'd love to replace it for him as a gift.
Well, I haven't seen too many like these.
Yeah, I know.
Maybe you wanna sell me that one?
Oh, sure.
Hang on a second.
I got a little proposition for you.
There is a George Bonanza to see you.
- Costanza.
Costanza.
- George Costanza.
The guy who pitched the show with stories about nothing.
- Jerry Seinfeld's friend.
- Seinfeld friend.
He says call him Monday.
Mr. Dalrymple, I have to talk to you.
It's about the show.
It was all a terrible misunderstanding.
Just five minutes of your time.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Dalrymple.
Very good, sir.
You don't understand.
I can't allow my son to pay for me.
Look, as soon as I get back to Florida, I promise you, I'll mail you a check.
Why don't you just let him pay, and then you can pay him back.
- No, no.
He won't let me do that.
- Why don't you put the money in his pants pocket unsuspectingly?
- He could wash them.
- We are running a reputable business.
Don't tell me about business.
I sold raincoats for 35 years.
- But you did not give them away.
- You don't understand I cannot get involved with you and your family.
Okay, now, look.
Don't take too long.
Look at this building.
What is this?
I don't know.
It's a building.
- The doors are on a diagonal.
- So what?
It's architecturally incorrect.
Just go.
Is this a bad time?
I hope I'm not disturbing anything.
We were about to sit down to dinner.
- This is Cynthia.
- Oh, hi.
Hi.
Nice to meet you.
- What are you having?
Veal?
- No.
- Looks like veal.
- It's not veal.
Well, it's a good-looking piece of meat.
Wow, this is some place.
A duplex, huh?
Look, stairs in an apartment.
All my life I dreamed about having steps in an apartment.
Even one step.
Sunken living room.
Although one step is not all that sunken.
- Who gave you my address?
- No, that's a fair question.
It is.
Jerry.
Yeah.
Jerry's a friend of mine.
He gave it to me.
Unbelievable how many addresses this guy has.
He's got Marlon Brando's.
I could go to Marlon Brando's house if I wanted.
Of course, I wouldn't.
The guy is Obviously, the guy has his problems.
So you wanna talk about the show?
Well, you know, it's really very funny.
Because, you know what we got here, really?
We really just have a terrible misunderstanding.
See when I passed on the deal, I thought that's what Jerry wanted me to say.
- I misinterpreted.
- Russell, where's the TV Guide?
What time is it?
8:30.
I'll tell you what's on.
You got Major Dad, Blossom Very funny program.
- Blossom's on Monday.
- Are you sure?
Look who I'm talking to.
The president of NBC.
Mr. Costanza, it's too late anyway.
I made a deal with another writing team.
All right, look.
We're people, you and me.
Businessmen, colleagues, if I may.
Let's not quibble.
We'll do it for the $ 13,000.
Thirteen thousand, and I never came up here.
We never talked.
You take good care.
It's nice seeing you again.
- Nice meeting you.
Cynthia, right?
- Now, look.
These deals are already made.
All right.
Let me just say this.
Ten thousand dollars.
I'm going below what you wanted to pay.
You're having your dinner.
Have your veal or whatever it is.
Enjoy.
- Mr. Costanza.
- All right.
That's it.
All right.
Good, $8000.
Cynthia, again, nice meeting you.
Have I commented on the shoes?
I love suede.
It's so thick and rich.
Do you ever rub it against the grain?
Russell, can we eat?
- All right, 8000.
- You made Jerry very happy.
Could I just use your bathroom for a moment?
All right, 200.
That's as high as I can go.
I think you're being unreasonable.
Jerry, I'd give you the watch.
It's not the money.
I happen to like it.
Look, I happen to know how much that watch costs.
It's a $60 watch.
You paid 40 to get it fixed.
That's $ 100.
- I'm offering you 200.
- I never seen a band like this.
All right, 300.
Plus 50 for the repair.
Three-fifty, that's it.
Do you have it on you?
Yeah, I think I do.
This is unbelievable.
What the hell is going on here?
Well, it's a pleasure to meet you.
- Thank you for coming in.
- Thank you.
- Please sit down.
- Alrighty.
Could I offer you something to drink?
Coffee, anything?
Okay, yeah.
I'll have a Do you have a decaf cappuccino?
I don't think we have that.
Well, that's a little strange.
- Why does that surprise you?
- Well, it's a very popular drink.
- This is an office.
- That's true.
- But, you know, I can't help but think - So tell me, Mr. Kramer Okay, sure.
Tell me all about you and Elaine.
Oh, alrighty Well, what we have here, doctor, is an extraordinary situation.
- Is it?
Oh, you'd better believe it.
You really have a terrible voice.
Do I know you?
- I don't think so.
- Because you really look familiar.
Oh, well, maybe you've seen me.
My face is on Mount Rushmore.
- Yes, of course.
That's it.
I guess I'm just used to seeing it on a much larger scale.
Oh, yeah, right.
I replaced Teddy Roosevelt.
Oh, really?
Trustbuster.
Bust this.
You know, I never thought of it like that before, doctor.
- You are absolutely right.
- I'm glad we agree.
Would you like a cigar?
They're Cubans.
- I'd love one.
- Yeah.
I think Elaine is a wonderful woman.
You two will make a wonderful couple.
If you ever feel you need to talk to someone about anything, you have my number.
Well, that's very kind of you.
These are good, huh?
I cannot believe I'm doing this.
I never meet people like this.
- You're not a nut, are you?
- No, I don't think so.
I can't believe I'm doing this.
I never do stuff like this.
Really?
I give my number to just about every customer who comes in here.
- You don't seem that desperate.
- Oh, yeah.
Actually I'm a little disappointed.
I kind of had my eye on Uncle Leo.
Well, I'll give you a call, and thanks for the fish.
- You know why fish are so thin?
- Why?
They eat fish.
- Hey.
- What happened?
- What took you so long?
- He's a terrific guy.
What are you talking about?
What did he say?
- We talked about a lot of things.
- You talked about a lot of things.
Well, did you talk about us?
I'm in love.
I just met her outside in the street.
Her name's Elaine.
She is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen.
Did you say Elaine?
How come with the psychiatrist, every "the hour" is only 50 minutes?
What do they do with that Do they just sit there going, "Boy, that guy was crazy.
I couldn't believe the things he was saying.
What a nut.
Who's coming in next?
Oh, no, another headcase".
- You should've told me it didn't work.
- I know, I know.
- You didn't have to throw it out.
- I was always late.
It was frustrating.
I'm sorry.
I really am.
- That must be Leo.
- I would've taken you to the airport.
- He has nothing to do.
- Neither do I. - Yeah?
- It's George.
Come on up.
It's George.
- Oh, George.
- Whatever happened with NBC?
- George turned it down.
- He turned it down?
- Why did he do that?
- Because of Ted Danson.
- What does he have to do with it?
- Maybe he doesn't like Ted Danson.
Who knows?
Maybe we'll wind up getting more money.
- Hey.
- Hey, Georgie boy.
How are you?
Hey, Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld.
How are you?
What's the matter with you?
- What did I do?
- What about NBC?
Hear anything?
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I did.
We got a deal.
You see, he had the right idea.
Hold out.
That's how you get the big money, huh, George?
- Please, Morty.
- He knows how to talk to these people.
No one's gonna take advantage of Georgie.
I'm just happy to be working with your talented son who is not doing this for the money.
That is so refreshing.
- So, what did we get?
- Eight thousand dollars.
- Beautiful.
- That's for the two of us.
- Four thousand apiece?
- Let me see if I understand this.
In other words, you held out for less money.
- I was wrong.
You were right.
- The basic idea of negotiation as I understand it is to get your price to go up.
- You're smart.
I'm dumb.
- This is how they negotiate in the Bizarro World.
That's gotta be Leo.
- Yeah.
- It's Leo.
- All right, we're coming down.
- Let's get going.
Dad, before we go, I got a little something for you.
- A present.
- A present?
Hey, look at this, a wallet.
Exactly what I needed.
- You see?
- Come on, you lost your wallet.
- I figured I'd get you another.
- I hope you didn't spend too much.
This is one of the most thoughtful gifts anyone's ever given me.
- He's something, your son, isn't he?
- All right.
Let's go.
- You're a terrific kid.
- Yeah, he's something, isn't he?
How can anybody not like you?
- You're very special.
- Yeah.
I'm good for about $4000.
- Hey, let's go.
It's 12:22.
- All right, Leo.
- Hey, Uncle Leo.
How you doing?
- Hi, hi.
I got it.
This is some beautiful parking spot you've got here.
- I hate to give it up.
- Yeah.
Dad, you're sure you don't need more money?
- Jerry.
- All right, I'm just joking.
Listen, have a nice trip.
- Bye, Mrs. Seinfeld.
Take care.
- Thanks again for the wallet.
- Morty, always a pleasure.
- Yes.
Take care, now.
So long.
- Yeah, like he'd take your money.
- He took it.
I put $400 in the wallet.
He lost all that cash.
It was the only way I could give it back.
- Otherwise, he wouldn't accept it.
- I'd love to see the look on his face.
- You believe this?
- What?
- It's Velcro.
- You're kidding.
Who needs this?
Leo, let's go.
The main difference between women's and men's wallets is the photo section.
True?
Women carry with them a photo of every person they've ever met every day in their whole life since the beginning of time.
Every picture's out of date.
You know what I mean?
"Here's my cousin, 3 years old.
She's in the Marines now.
This is my dog.
He died during the Johnson administration".
You get stopped by a cop.
No license, no registration.
"Here's 56 people that know me".
Cop goes, "Just wanted to make sure you had some friends.
Move it along.
Routine pal check".
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Ever called someone and were disappointed when they answered?
You wanted the machine.
You're always thrown off.
You go, "Oh, l I didn't know you were there.
I just wanted to leave a message saying, 'Sorry I missed you".
' So here's two people who hate each other, don't really ever wanna talk but the phone machine is like this relationship respirator keeping these marginal, brain-dead relationships alive.
We do it so when we come home, you can see the little flashing red light.
You go, "All right, messages".
You see, people need that.
It's very important for human beings to feel popular and well-liked amongst a large group of people we don't care for.
Well, this is it.
Oh, this is nice.
- Thanks again for the Chinese food.
- Oh, you're welcome.
- I think I ate too much of that garlic.
- Me too.
I ate the whole plate.
I didn't know.
I thought they were peanuts.
You know what, I think Naked Gun is on.
Oh, I've seen it.
I laughed through that whole thing.
Wanna watch?
No.
- I mean, I don't think so.
- I thought you liked to laugh.
I thought you were happy-go-lucky.
No, no.
I'm not happy, I'm not lucky, and I don't go.
If anything, I'm sad-stop-unlucky.
That's not funny, Naomi.
I didn't mean to be funny there.
Why don't you check the TV Guide?
I think Holocaust is on.
Jerry, it's George.
You all set for the weekend?
This is gonna be great.
You'll have a great time with Naomi.
All right, she's got that laugh.
What'd you say, it's like Elmer Fudd sitting on a juicer?
I was thinking we'd take two cars up to the cabin.
That way, you know, if one of us wanted to stay This thing has never worked right.
You think I laugh like Elmer Fudd sitting on a juicer?
Well, first of all, Elmer Fudd is one of the most beloved internationally known cartoon characters of all time.
"I'm gonna kill that cwazy wabbit".
Come on!
Not only that, a juicer is one of the healthiest ways It makes juice, it extracts the pulp and And then the vitamins.
For long life and vitality.
How could you leave a message like that?
How could you play it to just anyone?
I didn't think you'd leave it.
- I didn't think you'd play it.
- Now she's not coming this weekend.
What do you mean, not going?
We got plans.
Call her up.
Ah, it's better anyway.
I mean, really.
What was gonna happen?
I'm a comedian.
How can I go out with a girl with a laugh like that?
It's like Coco Chanel going out with a fishmonger.
You know, she's with all the perfumes, and a fishmonger's a pretty bad smell.
Well, maybe you should ask Elaine.
But if I ask Elaine, Kramer will feel slighted.
Oh, no, no.
Don't say anything to Kramer.
Susan can't stand him.
He vomited all over her.
Wait a minute.
Do you smell smoke?
- Ah, Kramer.
- Hello, boys.
Top of the morning to you.
What do you say?
What do you be?
Put that thing out before you start another fire.
You had to give him cigars.
So, what are you guys doing this weekend?
- Ah, we're - Because I'm gonna be playing golf at the Westchester Country Club.
Westchester?
Isn't that a private club?
That's right, buddy.
It's private.
It's very private.
I met the pro at the golf shop up on and he invites me for a free round.
Then he says, anytime I lay one of these on him, it'll be the same deal.
- Wow.
- Isn't that beautiful?
Man, I'm gonna be hitting the links all weekend.
- Gee, that's That's too bad.
- Yeah.
Too bad.
- Why?
What?
What?
- Because we were just saying we were gonna ask you to the country.
Susan's father has a cabin up there, but all right.
They got any golf courses up there?
No, no, no.
- No, no, that's pie country.
- Yeah.
Yeah, they do a lot of baking up there.
They sell them by the road.
Blueberry, blackberry.
- Blackberry, boysenberry.
- Boysenberry, huckleberry.
- Raspberry, strawberry.
- Strawberry, cranberry.
Peach.
- I don't know.
- Come on, I don't wanna tag along with George and Susan.
With you, it's a better group.
- What's that?
- Oh, it's an autographed picture for my dry cleaner.
I never know what to write on these things.
I hate doing this.
"I'm very impressed"?
You mean "pressed" because it's a dry cleaner?
Yeah, see?
That's why I hate it.
So come on, you wanna go?
Well, what about the sleeping arrangements in the cabin?
Well Same bed, and underwear and a T-shirt.
- What about me?
- Well, you'd be naked, of course.
- Excuse me.
Jerry Seinfeld?
- Yeah.
My names Sanger, Mel Sanger.
I drive that truck out there.
- The Yoo-hoo?
- Yeah.
- I love Yoo-hoo.
- Yes, it's a fine product.
I saw you on The Tonight Show a couple of weeks ago.
I was watching the show with my son Donald.
He's got this rare immune deficiency in his blood.
The damnedest thing.
Doctors say he has to live in a plastic bubble.
Can you imagine that?
A bubble.
- A bubble?
- A bubble?
Yes, a bubble.
- Do you mind?
May I?
- Oh, sure.
It'd break your heart seeing him in there.
He's like a prisoner.
No friends.
Just his mother and me.
And I'm out there six days a week hauling Yoo-hoo.
We have sacrificed everything, all for the sake of our little bubble boy.
- Excuse me.
- Oh, here.
Excuse me.
Anyway, we were watching you on TV You get in the bubble with him?
No.
He can see through the bubble, it's plastic.
- Oh, I thought it was like an igloo.
- No.
It's clear.
Who has the remote?
He does.
The remote goes through the bubble?
Yeah.
He's in the bubble with the remote.
So you have no control over the remote?
No.
It's frustrating.
Yeah.
Of course.
Yeah.
So anyway, you're his favorite comedian.
He laughed so hard the other night we had to give him an extra shot of hemoglobin.
That's nice.
Tomorrow is his birthday.
And it would mean so much to him if you could find it in your heart to pay him a visit and just say hello.
- Oh, well, tomorrow, l Jerry.
Of course he'd pay him a visit.
You'd be happy to.
Yeah.
Okay Tomorrow.
Where do you live?
Uptown?
Up Westside?
- No.
Upstate.
- Upstate.
He's a bubble boy!
- A bubble boy?
- Yes, a bubble boy.
- What's a bubble boy?
- He lives in a bubble.
Boy.
What kind of a bubble, like an igloo?
No, that's what I thought.
It's a piece of plastic dividing the room.
What kind of plastic do you think it is?
Like that dry-cleaning plastic?
That's no good.
He wouldn't last 10 minutes in there.
What can I do?
I promised I'd go visit him tomorrow.
It's his birthday.
I can't go to the cabin.
- Well, where does he live?
- I don't know.
Upstate.
Fall-something.
Wait a minute.
This is right on the way to the cabin.
Oh, all right.
Beautiful.
So you stop in, visit the bubble boy for 20 minutes then we can go.
- You think so?
I know exactly where this is.
You can just follow us.
Oh, great.
Okay, we're going away.
- I think I'm excited.
- I'm excited.
Oh, you're gonna love this cabin.
My grandfather built it in 1947.
- It's incredible.
- There you go.
It's a '47 cabin.
- So we'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.
Well, hey.
Very nice.
Very nice.
- Well, I'm off to the links.
- Yeah.
I wanna thank you for the invite upstate.
I'm sorry I can't make it.
- The what?
- Nothing.
Let's get going.
Come on.
- Did you?
- No, no, we'll talk about it later.
Is that one of the cigars my father gave you?
Hey, what's with George and Susan?
Does he actually like her?
I don't know if he likes her as much as he likes it.
Oh, that's nice.
What's he doing?
What is his hurry?
Oh, you know George.
He's gotta make "good time".
He once went from West 81 st St. to Kennedy airport in 25 minutes.
I never heard the end of it.
Look at him.
Would you stop that, please?
Just stop that.
- Why?
- Knock it off.
You're distracting me.
We're making incredible time here.
I once made it to Kennedy airport from West 81 St. in 15 minutes.
Oh, here.
Hold this.
It's $ 10 for the tolls.
What's he doing?
Is he out of his mind?
Do you see him?
I don't even see him anymore.
Where is he?
- Isn't that blue car him?
- No, no, that's not him.
What happened to him?
I can't believe it.
I lost him.
That stupid idiot.
- Now what are we gonna do?
- It's no big deal, Jerry.
We'll just meet him at the bubble boy's house.
I don't even know where the bubble boy lives.
I don't even remember the name of the town.
- You don't have the directions?
- No, I was following him!
How could you not take the directions?
Because he's my directions.
I don't see them, George.
You make plans, then he goes 100 miles an hour the weekend's over just like that.
Poor little bubble boy.
He's sitting there waiting for you in his bubble or igloo thing, whatever.
I don't know what to do.
I don't know where I am.
Just get off at this exit.
We'll figure something out.
We lost them.
Do you know that?
We lost them.
Well, it's not my fault.
Seinfeld can't drive.
How hard is it to follow somebody?
Well, now what are you gonna do?
It's fine.
We'll just meet him at the bubble boy's house.
Does he have the address?
Yeah.
Leave a message, I'll call you back.
Thanks.
Hi, Jerry.
It's Naomi.
Listen, if it's not too late, I changed my mind.
- I'd like to go to the cabin.
- Wait.
Wait.
Yeah, hello.
Hi.
This is Kramer.
Yeah.
I'm the next-door neighbor.
You know, Jerry's left, but listen, you see, my golf game got canceled.
I'm thinking of going up myself.
They got pies, and I got the directions right here.
I drive all the way to the country club and then I find out there's a tournament going on.
- You mind if I smoke?
- No.
These are Cubans.
I don't know if this is the house.
I don't see Jerry's car anywhere.
Would you stop it?
Would you quit it, please?
Someone is gonna see us here.
So what?
You are such a prude.
Hey.
I am not a prude, sweetheart.
I swing with the best of them.
- Come on, let's go in.
- What?
We should tell them what happened.
They might be very late if they make it all.
- I can't go in there.
I can't face the bubble boy.
- What's the matter?
- I don't react well to these situations.
My grandmother died two months early from how I reacted in the hospital.
She was getting better.
Then I paid her a visit.
She saw my face, boom.
That was the end of her.
- We're going in.
- Wait, please - Come on, George.
George, stop.
- Would you wait one moment I can't believe a little thing like George speeding and my whole weekend is gone.
The plans, the packing.
Everything.
Your whole weekend?
What about the bubble boy?
Why do you keep bringing up the bubble boy?
You don't have to mention him.
I know about the bubble boy.
I'm aware of the bubble boy.
Why do you keep reminding me about the bubble boy?
I'll have a cup of coffee and a turkey club.
- How about you?
- I'll just have a glass of water.
You can't just have water.
Why not?
That's all I want.
This isn't a park bench where you come in and sit down.
It's a business.
Hold it a second.
Don't you play on TV?
- Oh, no.
- Yes.
Yes, you saw him on TV.
- What's your name?
- Jerry Seinfeld.
- Elaine - Gary Seinfield.
- I saw you on The Tonight Show.
- Right.
Wouldn't you like an autographed picture?
I don't have any more pictures, Elaine.
He's lying.
They're in the trunk.
- Now you get to sign another one.
- I'm not lying.
Yeah.
Yeah, he is.
She'll have a cup of coffee and a broiled chicken.
See, it's not really a bubble.
A lot of people think it's an igloo, but it's really just a plastic divider.
Can you go in the bubble?
Well, you have to put so many things on because of the germs.
The gloves, the mask, it's a whole production.
So then he makes his own bed?
Well, that's one of the things we fight about.
Would you like to meet him?
- Ah, well, you know - Oh, he loves games.
Maybe you could play Trivial Pursuit with him.
Hey, Ma!
What the hell do I gotta do to get some food around here?
I'm starving.
And if it's peanut butter, I'm gonna shove it in your face!
- One picture left in the trunk.
- Thanks.
This is fun.
Yeah, this turned out to be a great weekend.
Where's my water?
Oh, it's coming.
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
What'd you write?
"Nothing's finer than being in your diner".
There is "nothing finer than being in your diner"?
- No good?
- This is what you came up with?
Well?
That is so lame, Jerry.
People will be reading that for the next 20 years and laughing at you.
Yeah.
Yeah, you're right.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Would you mind?
I'd like the picture back.
- Why?
- I'm not happy with what I wrote.
- It's good.
I like it.
- No, believe me, it's not good.
I'll mail you one with something really funny.
Well, when you mail me a new one, I'll send you back this one.
You don't understand.
I want the picture.
Right.
This is Donald.
- Hi.
- Hello.
Who are you?
- Where's Seinfeld?
- He's on his way.
These are his friends.
What are you looking at?
Never seen a kid in a bubble before?
Of course I have.
Come on.
My cousin's in a bubble.
My friend Jeffrey's sister also, bubble, you know I got a lot of bubble experience.
Come on.
- What's your story?
- I have no story.
She works for NBC.
How about taking your top off?
Donald, behave yourself.
Come on.
I know, I know.
Why don't you play a game of Trivial Pursuit?
Ah, you know, we gotta be running What, are you afraid?
- No.
You see, it's - I'm gonna kick your ass.
I was nice enough to give you the picture.
I don't like what I wrote.
I don't want it up there.
Please just give it back.
You are really starting to get under my skin.
- I want that picture.
- Well, you can't have it.
In fact, maybe you better just pay your check, and get out.
I'm not paying until I get that back.
Well, you ain't getting it back.
Well, maybe I'll just take it back.
This chicken is really good.
Okay, history.
This is for the game.
How you doing over there?
Not too good.
All right, bubble boy.
Let's just play.
"Who invaded Spain in the eighth century"?
That's a joke.
The Moors.
Oh, no.
I'm so sorry.
It's the "Moops".
The correct answer is the Moops.
Moops?
Let me see that.
That's not Moops, you jerk.
It's Moors.
It's a misprint.
I'm sorry.
The card says Moops.
It doesn't matter.
It's Moors.
There's no Moops.
- It's Moops.
- Moors.
- Moops.
- Moors!
Hey!
Anybody home?
- Oh, boy.
- What should we do?
Hold these pies.
Okay.
Help.
Someone - There's no Moops, you idiot!
- Stop it!
Let go of him.
Donald.
Stop it.
Now, let go of him, Donald.
- I'm gonna kill him.
- He's choking me.
- Donald.
Stop.
- Moors!
Say Moors!
Moops.
Moops.
Donald, stop it.
What are you doing?
You're choking me.
Elaine!
- Are you gonna pay today?
- No, I want that picture back!
Something's happened to the bubble boy!
- They're rushing him to hospital.
- What?
The bubble boy?
He lives around here?
That's his house, down the road.
He got in a fight with some guy.
Who kind of a person would hurt the bubble boy?
Some little bald guy from the city.
Come on, Vern.
Page, Preston, don't you think we ought to do something?
Naomi, come on, let's get going.
But that lake must be freezing.
No, it's good for you.
Retards the aging process.
Ready to go swimming?
Let's go.
Okay.
Jerry, what happened to you?
What happened to you?
You were going 100 miles an hour.
I was not.
Bubble boy tried to kill me.
- What?
- Susan, tell them.
It's a long story.
- Hey, Seinfeld.
- Hey, happy birthday.
Thanks for showing up.
- You know, your friend tried to kill me.
- He's a lying snot.
He's a cheater, aren't you, little twerp?
- Moors!
- Moops!
- Moors!
- Moops!
There's the guy who tried to kill the bubble boy.
Get him!
Fire engines.
Must be a big one.
Do you smell something?
- Yeah.
- Smoke.
Yeah.
Definite smoke.
Look, it's a fire!
Holy cow, look at that!
- It's my father's cabin!
- The cabin is on fire.
I just realized, you never gave me back the change from the tolls.
How could this have happened?
Oh, my God.
The cabin.
What are you two doing here?
Look at that.
Hey, you didn't: My Cubans.
Something very scary and exciting about fire.
People always run to see a fire.
They're very proud if they have a fireplace.
I think that's what smoking is really all about.
That's the power of smoking.
It's just this thing: "I got fire right here in my hand.
Smoke and fire is literally coming right out of my mouth".
And it's very intimidating to the nonsmoker.
It's like talking to someone going: "My head could open up.
Lava could explode out.
Pour right down my face.
Doesn't bother me a bit".
And a cigar is even worse.
I mean, a cigar is like: You think this end is bad.
Look at this wet, disgusting nub, huh?
How scary is that?
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
I think people think of their office as a stationery store with Danish.
You know what I mean?
You wanna get your pastry your envelopes, your supplies your toilet paper, six cups of coffee, and you go home.
Why do people that work in offices have pictures of their family on their desk facing them?
Do they forget that they're married?
Do they go, "5:00.
Time to hit the bars and pick up hookers.
Hold it a second.
I got a wife and three kids.
I better get home.
I completely forgot".
- She hasn't told her father yet?
- We're supposed to tell him tonight.
- What do you mean, "we're"?
- Susan wants me to be there.
You're meeting the father for the first time?
- Yeah.
- You'll make quite an impression when you tell him how you burned his cabin down.
I didn't burn it down.
Kramer did.
I mean, the whole thing is ironic.
Think of it.
The guy's nice enough to give you a box of very fine Cuban cigars - I know what happened.
- No, wait.
- Then you dump them off onto Kramer.
- I know.
Who proceeds to burn the man's cabin down with one of those very same cigars.
It's very comical.
Maybe we shouldn't start writing today.
I got a lot on my mind.
We've put this off long enough.
Today's the day.
I wonder how Susan's father's gonna react.
What's the worst he can do?
So you burn a house down.
Come on.
Not even a house.
It's like a cabin.
We could build a cabin like that.
Well, maybe not us, but two men could.
BICs?
What, did you get BICs?
What, you got a problem with the pen, now?
I like a Rolling Writer.
They're smooth.
All right, let's just get to work.
NBC pilot.
Seinfeld Project.
Act 1, Scene A. So you're gonna sit there?
Let me explain to you one of the key elements involved in the writing process.
Because it may seem outwardly that the pen and the paper and the chair play a large role.
But they're all somewhat incidental to the actual using of the brain.
Okay, so just Just park yourself.
All right.
Act 1, Scene A. - Drink?
- No.
No drink.
- All right.
Here we go.
- Act 1, Scene A. - Weren't you supposed to call Elaine?
- Yes.
Hi, is Elaine there?
Oh, hi, Sandra.
Yeah, I can hold.
Every time I call, I gotta chitchat with her assistant for, like, 20 minutes.
Oh, hi, Sandra.
Listen, I'm at a pay phone.
There's a lot of people waiting to use it.
I'll be off in a minute!
Yeah, could you put me through to Elaine?
Okay, thanks.
Are you thinking of ideas?
Is there any way I can get you directly?
Every time I call, Sandra bends my ear for, like, 20 minutes.
So we're on for later?
Yeah, I'll come by after work.
Hey, I got a rubber-pencil thing happening here.
I gotta go.
I gotta go.
Sandra?
Sandra?
Can you come here for a second?
- Okay.
Let's go.
- Here we go.
- You got it?
Here we go.
- Yeah.
Okay, how about this: I'm in my apartment.
You come in.
It's beautiful.
And what do I say?
Could you do me a favor?
When my friends call could you not talk to them for too long?
Why, did Jerry say something?
No.
No.
He must've said something.
Oh, no, he didn't say anything.
- I can't work for you.
- Oh, God.
- I can't.
I'm leaving.
- No, Sandra I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I really am.
Listen, Jerry's under a lot of pressure right now.
It's very hard being a stand-up comedian.
Sometimes they don't laugh.
- All right, let's get going.
- All right, let's go to work.
- Let's go.
- Okay.
- Hey.
- We're in the middle of something.
- We're trying to do a little work here.
- Yeah, come on.
What's with you?
- No more golf.
- Why?
Remember I told you about the pro at the Westchester Country Club who's letting me play every time I gave him those Cuban cigars?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, well, I lost them all in the fire!
Hey, George, maybe you can ask Susan's father for some more.
What are you, crazy?
I can't ask the guy for more cigars after you burned down his cabin.
What's one thing got to do with another?
Kramer, please.
Well, I can't go back to the public courses now.
I can't.
I won't.
I mean, you know what that's like?
It's crowded.
The grass has big brown patches in it.
They don't rake the sand traps.
Not to mention the caliber of people you have to play with.
I can't help you.
You're gonna have to get them someplace else.
Where?
They're Cubans.
- You know what?
I should take off.
- What?
I gotta go to Susan's parents' house for dinner.
I wanna shower first, and I wanna leave plenty of time.
You got four hours.
What about the script?
I think we got a bite on it.
Doesn't George look like your sister Sara?
A slight resemblance.
Her son's a podiatrist, you know.
Oh, I have tremendous respect for people who work with feet.
I mean, to dedicate yourself to the foot You're toiling in virtual anonymity.
I mean How are you enjoying those cigars I gave you?
Oh, the cigars.
I'm sucking them down.
I'm puffing my brains out, yeah.
You know, those cigars are made special for Castro.
I did not know that.
Weird.
Wild.
- What?
- He's doing Johnny Carson, Daddy.
I didn't care much for his jokes.
- Daddy never laughs.
- Oh, well, so what?
Laughter.
What is that?
I mean, what is the point of opening your mouth and going: What is that?
You know, you can't get those cigars anywhere.
You and your cigars.
Wear some more lipstick.
Daddy, there's There's something that we have to talk to you about.
Oh, I forgot to ask you: how'd you like the cabin?
Oh, the The cabin.
Well After we get off the phone you tell her?
Of course she knows it was me who complained.
Now I'm responsible for this woman quitting.
- Oh, this is unbelievable.
- I know.
I screwed up.
It's all my fault.
- Would you call her?
- Oh, dial the number.
How could you do this?
I was just trying to help you.
Trying to help me.
Hello.
Sandra.
Hi, this is Jerry Seinfeld.
Listen, I wanted to tell you there's been a terrible misunderstanding.
See, I told Elaine that it was a real treat talking to you on the phone.
And she thought I was being sarcastic because I'm a comedian, and all.
She thought, I think, "Yeah, it's a real treat talking to her on the phone".
But I was really being sincere.
No, of course I like you.
Tonight?
Hold on a second.
- She wants to have a drink with me.
- Just go.
Go.
- Oh, I don't - Go.
Yeah, I think I can.
Yeah, I know where that is.
Okay.
I'll see you there.
Okay, bye.
Now I gotta have a drink with her.
The cabin.
Well Susan?
- About the cabin - I love that place.
My father built that cabin in 1947.
My mother was recuperating from impetigo at the time and Dad thought it would be a good idea to get her out into the fresh air.
She died there the following winter.
And Dad passed away His last words to me were: "Cherish the cabin".
Not, "Take care of your sister".
She's a paraplegic.
But, "Cherish the cabin".
And I have, for 45 years.
It's often been a sanctuary for me.
Kind of like Superman's Fortress of Solitude.
What?
Superman.
He built a Fortress of Solitude up at the North Pole to, you know, sort of get away from it all.
When I go, I'm passing it on to her.
Well, I'll take a hotel any day.
- Daddy?
- Yes.
Daddy, about the cabin.
Look, Henry, I spilled wine on me.
- What about it?
- Well, the thing is - What, what is it?
- Well, the cabin is kind of - George?
- Burned.
- Burned?
- There was a fire, and it Burned.
- The cabin burned?
- Yeah, burned.
Burned?
Was anything found?
Was it all burned to the ground?
Did they find anything?
- No.
Nothing.
- Nothing?
But, you know, Mr. Ross, if you look at the whole situation what with it being your cigars and everything it's really rather ironic.
One might even say, in a sense, comical.
Really.
Think about it.
- I can't believe you said that.
- What?
How could you say something like that to me?
What?
You were the one who was talking dirty.
I was just trying to keep up.
- That was a weird thing to say.
- Why?
It didn't mean anything.
I was trying to join in so you wouldn't feel embarrassed.
- Oh, I think you're really sick.
- I'm not sick.
You said much sicker things than me.
- I'm leaving.
- You're making too much of this.
Excuse me.
- Let me walk you to a cab.
- That's okay.
The main thing is that this is just between us.
- And that'll be the end of it.
- Oh, really?
I mean, people, they're not interested in things like this.
They don't wanna hear about it.
They really don't.
So we're drinking and talking.
And so she starts rubbing my leg.
Wow, what did you do?
Have you ever told a woman to stop touching your leg?
- Yeah.
Right.
- I know it's the wrong thing to do.
She works in Elaine's office.
But I can't get that hand off my leg.
I'm looking at the hand thinking, "That hand should not be on my leg".
But I can't make my brain to get my mouth to say the words: "Would you mind"?
Yet women have no problem getting the hand off.
How do they do that?
I don't know.
They're working on a whole other level.
- All right, so go ahead.
- So then we go back to my apartment.
So we're fooling around there.
You know, it's getting a little passionate.
And she starts with the dirty talking.
All right, all right.
Hold on.
Time out.
- What did she say?
- You know.
The usual.
No, I don't know.
How do I know the usual?
- Typical things.
- What's typical?
Give me typical.
She says That's very dirty.
That's absolutely filthy.
And then she starts talking about her panties.
I'm gonna need some water here.
So I said something.
Okay, what did you say?
Now, bear in mind, I am just trying to keep up.
- Of course.
- Okay.
So she's talking about her panties.
So So I said: "You mean, the panties your mother laid out for you".
"The panties your mother laid out for you"?
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.
It just popped out.
- Well, how did she react?
- She flipped out.
Just left.
Well, that's not offensive.
It's abnormal, but it's not offensive.
Look, the main thing is I don't want Elaine to know about any of this.
I mean, especially the pantie remark.
I mean, it's embarrassing.
She'd never let me hear the end of it.
What if this girl says something?
She will.
She's going back to work.
I talked her into it.
How stupid was that.
So Susan's father took that news pretty hard, huh?
Yeah.
He went into the bedroom and started sobbing.
- Guess he didn't see the humor in it.
- Yeah.
- Let's go.
We got a lot of work to do.
- All right.
- Big workday.
- That's right.
- Okay.
- Let's go.
- Right now.
- Let's do it.
- Okay.
- All right.
- What do you got?
- I got, you enter, you go, "Hi".
And I go, "Hello".
Now, we need something here.
- Oh, hey.
- Kramer!
Hey!
- Buddy!
- You guys are working.
I'll come back.
- No, no!
Come on.
- No, no!
No, you guys should get back to work.
- Don't leave.
We're taking a break.
- Oh, yeah?
George, did you talk to that guy about getting more cigars?
I told you.
I'm not gonna do that.
Okay.
Well I guess I'm just gonna have to take matters into my own hands, huh?
All right.
I'll see you guys.
Where are you going?
Don't run off like that.
Okay - I need to talk to someone.
- Well, what is this about?
Well, it's a very private matter, but extremely urgent.
- Are you an American?
- Oh, yeah.
I see.
- Excuse me.
- Okay.
- Okay, let's get going.
- Let's get focused here.
Come on, now.
Come on, let's get it together.
- Yeah?
- It's Elaine.
Come on up.
All right, you know what we should do?
We should go to the movies.
- Get away from the script for a while.
- We should.
I just have to go over to the Rosses' and drop off Susan's sunglasses.
- Come with me?
- Yeah.
Does she live with them?
No, no.
- Hey, nice going, Jerome Seinfeld.
- What?
I just got a message from Sandra.
She's coming back to work.
Well, then you've just gotta fire her.
Don't even think about it.
There's no two ways about it.
- Why, what happened?
Did you talk?
- Talk?
Did I talk?
l You're darn right I talked to her.
We talked up a storm.
I've concluded, from the basis the those talks that this isn't anybody you should be talking to.
- You really think I should fire her?
- Oh, yeah.
In fact, if George and I weren't so busy working, I'd do it myself.
What is your name, señor?
Kramer.
So Señor Kramer, what is this about?
- Cigars.
- Cigars?
- Cigars.
- What about cigars?
See, here, l I saved one of the cigar rings.
- You mean, one of these.
- Yeah, yeah.
That's them.
Okay, so I'd like to buy a couple of boxes of those from you.
You realize, of course, these are illegal in your country.
Well, illegal, huh?
I like that jacket.
- Hi!
- Hi.
How are you?
- Hey, Jerry.
- Hi.
I thought you guys were working today.
- Just taking a little break.
- Yeah.
- Oh, here's your sunglasses.
- Oh, thanks.
Come on in for a second.
This is my brother Ricky.
He's home from college for the weekend.
Hey, there, young fella.
- What's your major?
- I don't have one.
Well, you should always consider podiatry.
Nothing wrong with the feet.
And this is my aunt, Sara.
He doesn't look like me.
Sara, what do you have on your wheels?
Nothing.
They're clean.
Ricky, did you wipe her wheels off?
- Yes.
- Well, they're filthy.
It's just a matter of common courtesy.
You come in the house, you wipe your wheels.
Excuse me.
Hello, Raymond.
The man from the insurance company dropped this off.
Said it was the only thing left from the remains of the fire.
Oh, thank you.
Wow, I've never seen this before.
Oh, they're letters.
- Here.
- Oh, sure.
From From John Cheever!
"Dear Henry last night with you was bliss.
I fear my orgasm has left me a cripple.
I don't know how I shall ever get back to work.
I love you madly, John.
P.S. Loved the cabin".
- Well, we really should be - Yeah, look at the time.
heading out.
You know, it's a time The box!
My letters!
Give me that!
Who told you to open it?
Who's John?
Who's John?
!
- I knew it.
- I wanna know who John is!
John Cheever?
Dad!
You and John Cheever?
Yes.
Yes, he was the most wonderful person I've ever known.
And I loved him deeply.
In a way you could never understand.
Well, we really should be heading out.
Jerry hates to miss the coming attractions.
- Yeah, and because of the time.
- Yeah.
Time is what he's indicating there.
Anyway, onward and upward.
- Here we go.
- Let's go.
- Come on, now.
- Right now.
- You and me.
No fooling.
- You got it.
- All right, what do you got?
- I got, you come in, you say, "Hi".
And then I say, "Hello".
- All right.
So we need something.
- Yeah.
How about this: I say, "How's it going"?
"How's it going"?
Beautiful.
- Come on.
We were just on a roll now.
- All right.
- Did you get that line?
- "How's it going"?
- Did you write it down?
- I'm writing it.
"How's it going"?
- Real good!
- What?
You know how much money you cost me today?
$429.
- What, how?
- I got Sandra transferred to another office upstairs, okay.
So she blabs to Lippman about my long-distance calls to Europe!
- What calls?
- I made a friend when I was in Europe.
And we've been in touch, and Sandra told Lippman!
Did she say anything else to you?
Anything else?
What do you mean, "anything else"?
So she just left the office didn't say a word to you about anything?
- Yeah.
- Beautiful.
Why is that beautiful?
Oh, no.
Not beautiful.
It's $429!
Hey, look, I'm gonna pay for that.
- No, no.
- No, I insist.
I was the one that encouraged you to fire her.
- The whole thing was all my - Okay.
Fault.
Do you smell smoke?
Oh, hey!
Hey, Jer, I want you to meet my new friends here.
This is Luis, Jorge and Umberto.
- Hey.
- How you doing?
Nice to meet you.
Yeah, we're heading up to Westchester.
Gonna hit the links.
- Yeah.
- Hey, isn't that your?
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
We're going.
All right.
Hey, what are you reading?
The Falconer, by John Cheever.
It's really excellent.
John Cheever.
You ever read any of his stuff?
Yeah, I'm familiar with some of his writing.
You know.
Look, we gotta get back to work.
We just had a big breakthrough.
- Okay.
I'll leave you two alone.
- Okay.
Maybe I'll visit my mother.
She just bought me some new panties, and they're all laid out for me.
There's this whole talking-during-sex business.
I mean, what are we doing here?
The question is does the talking really improve the sex?
Or is the sex act now just there to spice up the conversation?
Eventually, I'm sure people will get too lazy even for phone sex.
They'll start having phone machine sex.
"Yeah, I want you really bad.
Just leave it on the tape".
Then, I guess, the phone company will come out with sex-waiting.
That'll be the new thing.
"Yeah, hold on, honey.
I got another call.
Oh, hi, baby.
One second.
Honey, I've gotta take this.
Yeah, I've got sex-waiting on the other line and I've got to take this".
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
The tuxedo is a woman's view that men are all the same.
We might as well dress them that way.
To me, a wedding is the joining together of a beautiful, glowing bride and some guy.
The tuxedo is a wedding safety device, created by women because they know that men are undependable.
So in case the groom chickens out everybody takes one step over, and she marries the next guy.
That's why the wedding vow isn't, "Do you take Bill Simpson"?
It's, "Do you take this man"?
Leave a message.
I'll call you back.
Thanks.
Jerry?
Joe Davola.
I have a hair on my tongue.
Can't get it off.
You know how much I hate that?
Of course you do.
You put it there.
I know what you said about me, Seinfeld.
I know you bad-mouthed me to the execs at NBC.
Put the kibosh on my deal.
Now I'm gonna put the kibosh on you.
You know I've kiboshed before.
And I will kibosh again.
- So, what do you think?
- About what?
- About the opera.
- I don't wanna go.
- You gotta go.
- I don't like the opera.
What are they singing for?
Who sings?
You got something to say, say it.
You don't understand.
That's the way they talk in Italy.
They sing to one another.
All right.
All right.
That's their way.
You listen to the language.
It's got that sing-songy quality to it.
It's the language, Jerry.
The language.
- So why don't they talk like that now?
- It's too hard to keep up.
You know, they got They were tired.
- Better get that.
- Yeah.
- It's me.
- Come on up.
- So?
- I don't know.
Come on.
It's opening night.
Black-tie, Pagliacci.
The great clown.
The great, sad, tragic clown, like you.
Well, that's very flattering.
How'd you get tickets?
They're impossible to get.
Well, I have many associates.
I don't know.
Opera, it's not my kind of thing.
Then I'm gonna call the whole thing off.
Wait a minute.
What about George, Susan and Elaine?
- Why do you need me?
- You're the nucleus the straw that stirs the drink.
You're the "magliana".
I guess if I'm the magliana, I should go.
All right.
All right.
- Good.
- Hey.
You got the tickets, right?
- No, I don't have them on me.
- What?
That's why I came over here.
My friend's got them.
I'll pick them up tomorrow.
I was gonna surprise Joey with them.
You got an extra one, right?
Oh, yeah!
So I finally get to meet your pal Joey.
- It's killing you, isn't it?
- Yeah.
So Joey's a great lover of the opera.
Listen I got news for you.
It's nice to be involved with somebody who's interested in something other than Nick at Nite.
You know, he's got a grip on reality.
He's He's happy.
He's well-adjusted.
Looking forward to meeting him.
I gotta go.
Where?
What's the rush?
To surprise Joey.
I've never been to his place.
- I'm just gonna pop in.
- Good, men love that.
Hey.
You got a message, buddy.
It could be from that blond.
Jerry?
Joe Davola.
I have a hair on my tongue.
What am I gonna do?
He's gonna put the kibosh on me.
- He's crazy, out of his mind!
- Steady, steady!
Now, calm yourself!
He's supposed to be on medication.
He told me he was on medication.
- What happened to his medication?
- Quiet!
Now let me think.
I'm gonna call the cops.
That's what I'm doing.
The cops.
Why?
!
They're not gonna do anything!
They're the cops.
They gotta do something.
He'll put the kibosh on me.
Do you know what it is to be kiboshed?
- Kibosh.
- It's a terrible mistake.
He thinks I ruined some deal at NBC.
I don't know anything about it.
- Call and tell him that.
- That That's what I'll do.
I'll just call him and tell him.
That's all I'll do.
Right.
He's a human being.
I'll talk to him.
He'll understand, right?
Yeah.
Don't mention my name.
Oh, I got the machine.
- What's his message like?
- Nice.
Hello, Joe.
Listen, this is Jerry Seinfeld.
I think there's been a huge, colossal misunderstanding.
Big.
Big.
If we could just talk, we could straighten this out so call me back.
Bye.
Joey?
Joey?
Oh, God.
It's you.
You scared me.
Good.
Fear's our most primal emotion.
You left your door open.
I know.
I like to encourage intruders.
What is all this?
Do you like it?
My home is a shrine to you.
Where did you get all these pictures?
I took them myself with a telephoto lens.
Coming out of your office, your apartment.
Shopping.
Showering.
Showering?
I develop them myself in my darkroom.
Would you?
Would you like to see?
In the darkroom?
Oh, no, thank you.
Not right now.
I'm a day person.
Are?
Are you all right?
Why?
Well, I don't know.
You just don't seem yourself.
- Who am I?
- Who am I supposed to be?
- That's a good question.
Good question.
It's very existential.
Who are you?
Who am I?
Well What are you doing here?
Oh, nothing.
I just stopped by to chat.
You know, shoot the breeze.
Were you able to get those Pagliacci opera tickets from your friend?
I'm really looking forward to it.
No, he couldn't get them.
We're not going.
Really?
Oh, damn it.
I just remembered I gotta go.
I left something on.
The gas, the lights, the water in the tub.
Something is on somewhere, so I'm just gonna get the Do you know the story of Pagliacci, Nedda?
I'm Elaine.
He's a clown whose wife is unfaithful to him.
Do you think I'm a clown, Nedda?
Do I think you're a clown?
No.
Not if it's bad to be a clown.
If it's bad to be a clown, then you are definitely not a clown.
But if it's good to be a clown, then I would have to rethink the whole thing.
You've betrayed me with another, haven't you, Nedda?
Who is he?
I want you to tell me who he is.
I want his name.
Tell me his name.
Oh, like any man would ever look at me.
Come on.
I'm gonna get out of here.
Pagliacci kills his wife.
See?
Now that's terrible.
That is That's not a nice thing to do at all.
I would assume I don't know how this Pagliacci thing turns out.
But I would assume that there was big, big trouble for that clown.
You're not leaving.
But, officer, he threatened me.
I don't understand.
That's not right.
What if it was the president of the U.S.?
I bet you'd investigate.
So, what's the difference?
I'm a comedian of the United States.
And I'll tell you, I'm under just as much pressure.
All right.
Thanks anyway.
Okay, bye.
- Who is it?
- It's George.
- You're locking the door now?
- Yeah.
Well, well.
Look at you.
It's a little skimpy there, isn't it?
You know the last time I wore this thing?
Six years ago.
When I made that toast at Bobby Leighton's wedding.
Oh, that was a bad toast.
It wasn't that bad.
I never heard anybody curse in a toast.
I was trying to loosen them up a little bit.
There were old people there.
All the relatives.
You were like a Redd Foxx record.
At the end of the toast, nobody even drank.
They were just standing.
They were just frozen.
People That might have been one of the worst all-time toasts.
Still, her father didn't have to throw me out like that.
He could've asked me to leave.
He had me in a headlock.
Susan's not going tonight.
What do you mean, not going?
Why not?
She had to pick up a friend at the airport.
It cost me $ 100, this ticket.
- Why didn't she pay for hers?
- That's a very good question.
She and I go to dinner, she doesn't even reach for the check.
All I'm asking for is a reach.
Is that so much to ask for?
It's nice to get a reach.
- Who is it?
- It's me!
Why are you locking the door now?
Because of Davola.
Get in here.
What the?
- How come you're not dressed?
- I am dressed.
- You're going like this?
- Yeah.
I want you to hear something.
- You said people dress up for opera.
- Well, people do.
I don't.
If you're going like that, I'm not going like this.
Wait a minute!
Do you think I'm comfortable here?
I can't change.
I got no clothes here.
You gotta go like that.
I can't go like this alone.
Why should I be uncomfortable because my apartment is closer?
That's not the issue.
We're friends.
If I gotta be uncomfortable, you gotta too.
All right.
I'll wear this.
It's bad enough I gotta go to the opera I gotta sit next to Ozzie Nelson over here.
Would you turn that down?
What is that crap?
It's Pagliacci.
Oh, beautiful.
We got a little problem here.
We got two extra tickets.
- Why, what happened?
- Susan isn't going and Elaine's friend isn't going.
- Fantastic.
We'll scalp the tickets.
We can make maybe 500 a ticket.
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.
People are looking for tickets here?
Are you kidding?
Opening night, Pavarotti in Pagliacci?
- We're gonna clean up.
- Oh, man, I knew I'd love the opera.
- Yeah, right.
- Come on, let's go get the tickets.
Listen, I gotta wait for Elaine.
I'll meet you at the theater.
- All right, yeah.
- Isn't scalping illegal?
Oh, yeah.
You sprayed him in the eyes with Binaca?
Cherry Binaca.
It's new.
See, I don't get that.
First they come out with regular.
A year later, they have cherry.
They know we like cherry.
Start with cherry.
Then come out with regular.
It was like I didn't know him.
He was a different person.
You should hear the message from my nut.
Where's George and Kramer?
I wanna get inside already.
I feel very vulnerable.
What you doing?
That's my quarter.
- No, it's not.
It's mine.
- I was just flipping it.
That's mine.
No, I dropped it.
It's mine.
All right, you want it, take it, but don't try and tell me it's yours.
Well, it is mine.
What, you think I care about the money?
Is that what you think?
I'll show you.
Look at this.
Here's a dollar.
Look.
That's how much I care about money.
You think I care about money.
That's how much I care about money.
- Why don't you get lost?
- Why don't you?
- Because I was standing here.
- Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
I kind of like this opera crowd.
I feel tough.
Anybody else got a problem?
- Hey, clown.
- Clown.
Make us laugh, clown.
- Nice face, clown.
- Make me laugh, clown.
I got two.
I got two.
Pagliacci.
Who needs Pagliacci, huh?
Come on, the great tragic clown.
Come on, check it out.
He laughs, he cries, he sings.
Pagliacci.
I got two beauties right here.
Check it out.
- All right.
- Hey, hey, you selling?
I'm selling.
- Where are they?
- Orchestra, row G, dead center.
Primo.
You think you died and went to heaven.
What do you want for them?
I'll tell you what I'll do.
You look like a nice guy.
A thousand dollars for the deuce.
- Give you $500 for the pair.
- Yeah.
It's a deal.
- No.
- What, no?
Are you crazy?
- Look, let me handle this.
- That's $500.
That's a great deal.
You're blowing it.
The guy's a pigeon.
Oh, God, see, he's walking away.
What is wrong with you?
That was a $300 profit.
I know what I'm doing here, George.
This is not a Metallica concert.
It's an opera, all right?
A little dignity.
A little class.
Give me my ticket.
I will stand over here and sell it.
Thank you.
Stand over there.
I'll stand over here.
- I know where I'm standing.
- All right.
- Get your Pagliaccis here!
- Pagliaccis right here, huh?
Where are they already?
I guarantee you they don't sell those tickets.
Hey, look.
There's Bobby Leighton's father-in-law.
Mr. Reichman.
George and I were just talking about him.
He threw George out of the wedding.
Oh, yeah, when George made that bad toast.
- You remember the curse toast?
- Oh, yeah.
The curse toast.
Can you believe that message?
I gotta spend my life looking over my shoulder.
Me too.
Crazy Joe Davola.
- How do you know his name?
- Why wouldn't I know his name?
- I never told you his name.
- I never told you his name.
- Who are we talking about here?
- Joe Davola.
Right, Joe Davola.
How do you know his name?
I've been out with him three times.
I should know the man's name.
- Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
- He's stalking you?
- Are you kidding me?
- You're dating the madman who's trying to kill me?
- Why didn't you tell me his name?
Last night he accused me of seeing someone else.
- He said, "Tell me his name"!
- He said that?
If he sees us, can you imagine what he'll do?
If he thinks I ruined his NBC deal and stole his girl!
- That will be a kibosh for sure.
- What about me?
Excuse me.
Come on.
This is Pavarotti.
Three hundred dollars.
That's a lot of money.
Steven Holtzman did a production in Tunis last year.
From what I understand, the Muslims really took to it.
I'll tell you what.
You seem like a nice guy.
Let's stop jerking around.
Give me $250.
I got people waiting for me.
I gotta get the hell out of here.
Scalping.
I told them to put on extra security.
Excuse me.
Pop, would you buzz off?
I got something cooking here.
- Costanza?
- Mr. Reichman?
Still a sewer-mouth.
Give me those tickets.
Harold, don't.
Harold, be careful of your hair transplant!
Anything is welcome.
I accept change.
I don't have anything.
I gave it to that guy.
You know, you could just say no.
You don't have to humiliate me.
I may be dressed as a clown, but I am a person.
- The guy took - I don't need people like you looking down their noses at me.
I am just a street performer trying to make enough to get by.
Doctor, is there a doctor anywhere?
We need a doctor!
What are you, showing off for your girlfriend here, is that it?
I'm not his girlfriend.
We dated for a while but things didn't work out.
You people make me sick.
That is one angry clown.
The hardest part about being a clown it seems to me, would be that you're constantly referred to as a clown.
"Who is that clown?
I'm not working with that clown.
Did you hire that clown?
The guy's a clown".
How do you even start into being a clown?
How do you know you wanna be a clown?
I guess you just get to a point where your pants look so bad it's actually easier to become a clown than having the proper alterations done.
If you think about it, a clown, if there isn't a circus around them is really just a very annoying person.
I mean, you're in the back seat of this guy's Volkswagen "What, you're picking somebody else up?
Oh, man".
I got one.
Who needs one?
Pagliacci.
Pagliacci.
The tragic clown.
Pagliacci What did you say?
What, are you a cop?
No.
I'm a clown.
Man, you look familiar.
You ever been to the circus?
- Well, when I was a kid.
- Did you like it?
Well, it was fun.
Was kind of scared of the clowns.
Are you still scared of clowns?
Yeah.
We're gonna miss the overture.
Overture, curtains, lights This is it, we'll hit the heights And, oh, what heights we'll hit On with the show, this is it You know, it is so sad.
All your knowledge of high culture comes from Bugs Bunny cartoons.
Oh, there's that clown again.
What does he want from me?
Look, I'm serious.
I don't have the quarter.
- That guy took it.
- I don't want any money.
I smell cherry.
- It's Binaca.
- Binaca?
Go!
Go!
- All right, what did we say, 275?
- Two fifty.
- Two fifty?
Are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm sure.
- All right.
All right, 250.
- George!
- Susan.
- I don't believe it.
I'm so glad I caught you.
What are you doing here?
You were going to the airport.
Some plane problems.
They landed in Philadelphia.
So what?
They don't have another plane?
She couldn't take a bus?
She's coming in tomorrow.
But I made it.
Yeah.
How about that?
You made it.
I'm so excited.
Now we get to see the opera together.
We get to go to the opera Get out of here Together.
- Who's that?
- That's, that's Harry Fong.
He's a very good friend of mine.
He's a big opera buff.
Enjoy the show there, Harry!
- Come on.
Let's go.
- You know what?
- Come on.
You gotta let us in.
- Not without tickets.
We have tickets.
Just not with us.
Well, that's a problem.
Excuse me.
You don't understand.
Someone's after us, a crazy clown.
- He's trying to kill us!
- A crazy clown is after you?
Oh, that's rich.
Clear the way so people with tickets can pass.
- We're with him.
- Are you guys ready?
- Yes.
Yes.
- Have you seen George?
- We thought he was with you.
- Come on.
He's on his own.
Here.
Here I come.
- These are great seats, huh?
- Yeah.
Boy, some cast, huh?
Pavarotti, Eva Marton.
Eva Marton.
I've heard of her.
- Who's she playing?
- She's playing Pagliacci's wife, Nedda.
- Nedda?
- Yeah.
Oh, my God.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Susan, what are you doing here?
- My friend's flight couldn't make it.
- Hi.
- Where's George?
- I got his ticket.
He decided not to come.
He said he was uncomfortable.
Uncomfortable?
How do you think I feel?
- How much did you pay for that ticket?
- One seventy-five.
Kramer, who did you sell your ticket to?
Some nut in a clown suit.
I had some friends drag me to an opera recently.
They've all got those little opera glasses.
Do you really need binoculars?
How big do these people have to get before you can spot them?
These opera kids, they're going They're wearing big white woolly vests.
The women have the breastplates, the bullet hats, the horns coming out.
You can't pick these people out, forget opera.
Think about optometry.
Maybe that's more your thing.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
There's no easy way to break up.
When you start dating, they ought to give you "Get out of Relationship Free" cards.
You know what I mean?
So you could just go up to the person and go, "Here you go.
I'm sorry.
I'll grab the tennis racket.
Don't even bother to get up.
Have a good one.
Sorry".
Which is fine, unless the person you're in the relationship with has a "Eight More Months of Guilt, Torture and Pain" card.
"Hold it.
I got a little something for you".
- We're dead.
- We're not dead.
- We are dead.
- Come on.
We got all day tomorrow to think of a story.
All day tomorrow?
We had a month to come up with something.
We didn't do anything.
So we'll do it tomorrow.
Let me ask you: when's the last time you went skiing?
About six years ago.
I think you can take the lift ticket off your jacket now.
Women like skiers.
So what?
You can't meet anybody.
You're with Susan.
Yeah.
Right.
See those two women over there?
I almost dated the one on the right.
She's in the closet business.
Closet business?
- What's the closet business?
- What is it your business?
- I'm interested.
- She reorganizes your closet and shows you how to maximize your closet space.
She looked into my closet.
You thought she was good-looking.
This was a way to meet her.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
So, what happened?
She mentioned she had a boyfriend.
Then it hit me: What do I need more closet space for?
- Hi, Marla.
- Jerry.
- George, Marla.
- Marla.
George.
Jerry, Stacy.
- Stacy.
George, Stacy.
- Jerry.
- Stacy.
- George.
George.
Jerry, Marla.
Stacy.
- So, how was your trip to Berlin?
- Trip to Berlin?
Remember, that's why you put off the closets.
You said you were going to Berlin.
Oh, right, right.
The Wall had just come down.
You told me you wanted to be part of the celebration.
Yes, yes, I did, but you know, I was watching it on CNN and they covered it so well, I thought, why knock my brains out?
You know, my boyfriend went.
- Really?
- Yes, I told him all about you going and he got all excited and decided to go.
- Oh, did he like it?
- I don't know.
He never came back.
Anyway, we met with NBC about a month ago, and they gave us the green light to go ahead and write a pilot.
We got a big meeting with them tomorrow.
They gotta approve the story before we can write it.
Wow.
What a great job.
A writer.
Not a bad way to earn a buck.
Sounds great.
Well, I'll tell you, Stacy it's a lot of hard work.
But it comes fairly easy to me.
Some people write symphonies.
This is my gift.
- So you gonna go out with her?
- I might.
- What about Susan?
- What?
I'm not married.
I'm not allowed to go out with somebody else?
- Depends.
- Depends on what?
- On many factors.
- Like what?
Well, how long you've been seeing her.
What's your phone-call frequency?
Are you on a daily?
No.
Semi-daily.
Four, five times a week.
Saturday nights, do you ask her out, or is the date implied?
- Implied.
- She got anything in your medicine cabinet?
Might be some moisturizer.
Let me ask you this: Is there any Tampax in your house?
Yeah.
- I'll tell you what you got here.
- Yeah?
You got a girlfriend.
Oh, no, no.
What?
Are you sure, a girlfriend?
I'm looking at a guy in a semi-daily, with Tampax in his house and an implied date on Saturday night.
- I would like to help you out, but - Do you believe my luck?
The first time I have a good answer to "What do you do"?
and I have a girlfriend.
You don't need a girlfriend when you can answer that.
That's what you say in order to get girlfriends.
Once you can get girlfriends, you just want more girlfriends.
You're gonna make a very good father someday.
Well, it's not fair, Jerry.
It's just not fair.
That's it.
I'm getting out of this thing.
Break up with her.
But you know what this means.
- No, what?
- The script, the pilot, the TV show.
- That's all over.
- What do you mean?
Figure it out.
She's one of the executives that's gonna make the decision whether or not they pick up the show.
She's one of our biggest fans.
You drop her, you think they're gonna pick us up?
Oh, right.
Oh, no!
Man.
You know, it's a very interesting situation.
Here you have a job that could help you get girls.
But you also have a relationship.
But if you get rid of the relationship so you can get girls you lose the job.
- You see the irony?
- Yeah, yeah.
I see the All right, what about this?
What if I could find some way to break up with her so that she'll still like me, and it doesn't affect the deal?
- Yeah.
- Wait, wait.
Hear me out.
Hear me out.
Don't dismiss this.
You're quick to dismiss.
Don't dismiss.
She's got a big crush on David Letterman.
I mean, a big crush.
She talks about him all the time.
Suppose I go up to David Letterman.
He works at NBC.
I work at NBC.
I explain my situation.
He agrees to meet her.
They go out.
They fall madly in love and she dumps me for David Letterman.
- This is your plan?
- No, no, I'm just thinking.
I don't think you are.
Well, let me tell you what I see.
Please.
And be brutal.
I have no closet sensitivity.
- Are you very fussy about your pants?
- I don't think I am.
Because I have a very radical idea.
- Can you handle it?
- Try me.
Here's what I'm proposing.
We'll eliminate all this.
The hangers, the bar, the shelves, and in its place, install a series of hooks.
We'll put everything on hooks.
- Everything?
- Everything.
The shirts, pants, sports jackets, pajamas.
We can get 80 hooks on here.
You're quite mad, you know.
Oh, I don't believe this.
Hey.
Well, what are you doing?
I'm watching The Bold and the Beautiful.
- No.
- Wait, wait.
- This is not a good time.
- Five minutes.
What did you give your TV to George for?
Because I've been watching too much.
It was an addiction.
I couldn't stop.
It was destroying my brain cells.
Yeah, but now you're in here all the time.
Well Whoa.
- Marla, Kramer.
- Hello.
- Go out.
It's nice out.
- There's nothing out there for me.
- There's weather.
- I don't need weather.
Weather doesn't do it for me.
I'm telling George to give you your TV back.
No, no.
I don't want it back.
Are you gonna watch the Knick game tonight?
- I don't know.
- Will you tape it?
- Kramer.
- Oh, yeah.
So your boyfriend never came back from Berlin.
- Never came back.
- Oh, you must have been devastated being left for a wall.
Well it was about to end anyway.
There was this problem.
Excuse me one second.
- Yeah.
- It's me.
Come on up.
That's Elaine.
She's just a friend of mine.
I don't know what she's doing here now.
I'm sorry.
- What?
- I didn't get it.
So you were saying there was this problem.
Well, he wanted me to move in with him.
- Snapple?
- No, thanks.
- Go on.
- Well, I wouldn't move in, because - Yes?
- Well, because - Yeah?
- Well, because I'm a virgin.
Hello.
Hi.
Marla, Elaine.
Sorry, I didn't know you had company.
- I wanted to return your tape.
- Oh, thanks a lot.
Two weeks late.
Now it cost me $35 to see Havana.
I'm sorry.
I really am.
I just kept forgetting.
- I should be going.
- No, no, no.
I'm leaving.
I like that thing in your hair.
Yeah?
This woman was selling them at this crazy party I was at last night.
You'll appreciate this.
Snapple?
No, thanks.
I was talking to this guy, and I just happened to throw my purse on the sofa.
And my diaphragm goes flying out.
So I just froze, you know: Staring at my diaphragm, you know?
It's just lying there.
So this woman who sold me this hair thing she grabbed it before the guy noticed, so I mean big deal, right?
So I carry around my diaphragm.
Who doesn't?
I mean, like, it's a big, big secret that women carry around their diaphragms.
You never know when you're gonna need it.
I should be going.
- So we'll talk about the hooks then.
- Yes.
- What, was it something I said?
- She's a virgin.
She just told me.
- Well, I didn't know.
- Well, it's not like spotting a toupee.
Well, you think I should say something?
Should I say something, apologize?
- Was I being anti-virgin?
- No, no.
- I mean - Because I'm not anti-virgin.
- I'm gonna I'll be right back.
- Don't Elaine.
Elaine.
- Yeah?
- It's George.
- She's a virgin?
- A virgin.
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.
I'm very attracted to her.
That accent is so sexy.
I don't think I could do it.
They always remember the first time.
I don't wanna be remembered.
I wanna be forgotten.
You need a little pioneer spirit.
You don't have any of that Lewis and Clark in you.
You know, sometimes those guys don't make it back.
- I'm really hungry.
- Yeah, me too.
We gotta get something.
I don't wanna go on an empty stomach.
Let's get Chinese.
- Wanna order?
- All right, then we gotta get work done.
Let me just call Kramer.
See if he wants anything.
Hey.
We're ordering Chinese food.
If you want anything, let me know what and I'll order it for you.
- I'm in.
Let's go for it.
- All right.
What do you want?
- I don't care.
- All right.
Why don't we get a couple of dishes and share.
- All right.
- What are you getting?
- I think I'm gonna get a chow fun.
- What's a chow fun?
It's a broad noodle.
- What do you mean "a broad noodle"?
- It's a big, flat noodle.
Well, I don't want a big, flat noodle.
- What kind of noodle do you want?
- Who says I want a noodle?
I'm getting the chow fun.
You don't have to have any.
I'll get the pea pods, and you can't have any of my pea pods.
- Fine.
- And get extra MSG.
Look, Marla, this whole sex thing is totally overrated.
Now, the one thing you've gotta be ready for is how the man changes into a completely different person five seconds after it's over.
I mean, something happens to their personality.
It's really quite astounding.
It's like they committed a crime and wanna flee the scene before police get there.
- So they just leave?
- Yeah.
Pretty much, yeah.
Well, the smart ones start working on their getaway stories during dinner.
How, you know, they gotta get up early tomorrow.
It's always about being up early.
They all turn into farmers suddenly.
It must be really good to put up with all that.
Let's go.
We don't have time before the meeting.
The food.
What happened to Ping?
Don't worry, he'll be here.
Look, we only got two hours.
We need to come up with one good idea, we can get through this meeting.
There's your food.
Hey, what about this?
I'm in a car accident.
The motorist is uninsured.
- You with me?
- Yeah.
My car's totaled.
It's all his fault.
Now, he has absolutely no money.
There is no way that he could pay me.
So the judge decrees that he becomes my butler.
- Your butler?
- Right.
He cooks my food, cleans my house, does my shopping, there you go.
That's your program.
- What about me?
- Don't worry.
We find something for you.
That's the stupidest idea I ever heard.
Sentenced to be a butler.
- Ping, what happened?
- There was an accident.
Head hurts.
- Head really hurts.
- What happened?
Marla and I went out for coffee, and I was crossing the street and he was biking towards me, so I got out of the way in time but he ran into a parked car, hit his head and everything went flying.
Something happened to the food?
Could only save one bag.
Should I call an ambulance?
Wanna see a doctor?
I'll get some ice.
The pea pods?
All you saved was the pea pods?
- Hey, you got the food?
- Yeah, here.
Man, what took you so long?
Hey, Ping.
- Kramer.
- Yeah.
- Where's yours?
- He dropped it.
Oh, that's too bad.
You should slow down, you know.
It's dangerous to go that fast.
No, no, I have green light.
You jaywalk.
- Are you watching Oprah?
- I did not jaywalk.
You're giving him back that TV.
- Yes, you jaywalk.
- No, I don't want it.
Jaywalker.
I can slap a suit on you.
- What?
- We've got work to do.
- What about the meeting?
- An hour with Patrick Swayze.
A month and a half we had.
We did nothing.
We put it off until today.
Then we couldn't do anything because Elaine runs to apologize to a virgin crosses against the light and knocks over a Chinese delivery boy.
And now we're gonna go make fools of ourselves.
We got nothing.
You're not even in show business.
I got a reputation.
You're dragging me into the sewer with you.
I've been on TV, buddy boy.
You know how fast word spreads in show business?
Just like that: One bad impression, you're out of the business!
Let's postpone it.
Let's get out of here.
What?
They know we're here.
I'll fake an illness.
My back!
My back!
I can't move my back!
No, no.
Would you get up?
- I could do this, Jerry.
- No.
All right, I'll tell them that my sister died.
My poor sister died.
She was standing on the street, and then she was laughing and then they shot her!
That's the kind of a sick city we're living in!
They shoot you for laughing!
I must go and comfort my poor family.
Jerry, come on.
Take me home so I can comfort my My poor family.
- What?
- That's David Letterman.
I just saw David Letterman walk by.
Be right back.
Mr. Seinfeld, they're ready for you now.
Yes, I was very wise to hitch my wagon to his star.
- Hey, Jerry.
- Hi.
How you doing?
Nice to see you all.
- Hello, Jerry.
I'm Rita Kirson.
- Oh, nice to meet you.
- Where's Russell?
- He had to go to L.A. There's a problem on the set at Blossom.
Oh, poor Blossom.
Anyway, he asked me to sit in for him.
Where's George?
He ran to say something to David Letterman.
- David Letterman's on the floor?
- Yeah, he just walked by.
I think we should get started, anyway.
Yeah.
Good idea.
- So how are you guys coming along?
- Good.
Good.
We've got a number of ideas.
Good.
Have you been to a Chinese restaurant and they say five minutes for a table, and you wind up waiting there for 30 minutes?
Well, we thought it would be very funny to do an entire show where all you're doing is waiting for the table.
Because we've all been in that situation.
You know, you're You're waiting, and you're hungry and you bump into somebody you know.
- When is Russell coming back?
- So that's the idea?
Well, no.
That's one.
We have many others.
We have an idea where l I get into an accident with a guy who has no insurance and the judge sentences him to be my butler.
You know, and he cooks.
He has to cook for me.
And cleans my house and he's doing my shopping, you know.
And I'm walking around with one of those big neck-collar things.
Those collars are funny.
You see somebody in one of those, you start laughing immediately.
Are you telling them the butler story?
Is that beautiful or what?
Hey, I'm sorry I'm late.
Russell?
- I'm Rita Kirson.
- Oh, Rita.
Hey, Mr. Schirmack.
How are you?
Good to see you, Stu and Jay.
Always a pleasure.
Hi, sweetie.
Yeah, yeah, that butler idea, that's beautiful, isn't it?
Is that a killer?
- I thought I was getting the butler.
- Don't worry.
We'll find something for you.
So Letterman didn't spark to your idea, huh?
He said there was nothing he could do and next time I should probably break the Prozacs in half.
Hey, wanna hold it down.
I'm watching JEOPARD Y!
Would you give him back the TV?
Oh, by the way, Susan called for you a minute ago.
I'll bet they're probably doing somersaults about us over there.
You think they get butler stories like that every day?
Who is Joseph Cotten?
Giddyup.
- Hello?
- Yeah, hi, it's me.
It's Georgie boy.
- What's going on?
- What's going on?
What's going on?
I'll tell you what's going on.
I'm fired.
Fired, why?
Because you kissed me.
You kissed me, you stupid idiot.
Rita called Russell, and he fired me over the phone.
What is pi?
Giddyup again.
I'm killing, man.
But I didn't I had no idea I didn't realize.
You didn't realize?
How could you not realize?
You're stupid.
You are a stupid, stupid man.
I just feel terrible.
This is just terrible.
What is the cha-cha?
Yes, indeed.
I'll speak to you later.
This is great.
He fired her!
This is incredible.
He fired her!
I'm out, baby!
I'm out!
- Why'd he fire her?
- Because I kissed her in the meeting!
Russell found out.
He fired her over the phone!
Finally, my stupidity pays off!
What is "Here Come De Judge"?
"Here Come De Judge"!
You can't break up with her.
Her life is shattered.
You got her fired.
You gotta be there for her.
You gotta wait until she gets another job.
- Another job?
- A couple of interviews.
Oh, this is unbelievable.
I'm stuck.
Every time I think I'm out they pull me back in.
Are you going to want to leave after it's over?
You know, if we have sex.
What, leave?
Where, why?
You know, the apartment.
- Why would I?
This is my apartment.
- Well, what if it was my apartment?
Who gave you this idea I would wanna leave?
Well, Elaine said men like to leave after it's over.
I wouldn't put stock in anything Elaine has to say about relationships.
She comes from a broken home.
And I mean that literally.
A tree fell on the roof and cracked the structure.
Her parents got along beautifully, but the house was in bad shape.
Maybe I should be going.
- And what else did you say to her?
- Nothing.
I was just giving her the straight dope.
More like a dope was giving it to her straight.
Another cup of coffee with you, she'll wind up in a convent.
Listen, there was a lot more I could've told her, believe me.
What about leaving after sex?
Did I leave with you?
You might have, if I had stayed.
So you know what, I got served with papers today.
Ping is suing me.
I need your virgin as a witness, so be nice.
I was trying to be.
Look at George.
He lucked out, huh?
You're not kidding.
Who figured Susan would break up with him?
- They had a good thing going.
- Yeah.
Since she met him, she's been vomited on her family cabin's been burned down learned her father's a homosexual and got fired from a high-paying job.
Yeah, they had a real good thing going.
What do I do?
Well, actually, I'm a writer.
In fact, I'm writing a comedy pilot for NBC right now.
A sitcom?
How can you write that crap?
Carol.
This guy's writing a sitcom.
A sitcom?
A sitcom.
Can you imagine?
And he actually tried to use it to hit on me.
In ancient tribal cultures, they would actually sacrifice a virgin.
I mean, they would find some girl that had never been with anybody and throw her into a volcano.
There's a first date you'll never forget.
She winds up in heaven, talking with Chuck Woolery, so "Tell me, Lisa, how did the date end"?
"Not well, Chuck.
Not well".
"Well, if you'd like to be thrown into a volcano again, we'll pay for it".
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Don't visualize your parents having sex.
You know what I mean?
It's somehow very uncomfortable.
You know they had to have sex at least once to have you.
But you still kind of maintain the image in your head: "Well, I don't know.
I'm not positive.
I can't prove it.
I don't know if that actually happened".
That's why if I found I was adopted, that would come as great news.
"I'm adopted?
That's great".
I'd be happy to hear that.
That means technically it's possible, that my mother and father are just really great friends.
Sex is great, but you don't wanna think your whole life began because somebody had a little too much wine with dinner.
Let me ask you a question.
You're a hostage captured by terrorists.
- Who, me?
- You, anybody.
Whatever.
You're in the little room.
You're chained to the floor.
You're there for a long time.
Do you think they would consider doing laundry?
They have to.
It's in the Geneva Convention.
You.
Take off your socks and pants.
We're doing the wash.
Come on.
Take it off.
Take it off.
- Hey, Georgie.
- Hi.
What's the matter?
My mother caught me.
Caught you?
Doing what?
You know.
I was alone You mean?
- She caught you?
- Where?
I stopped by the house to drop the car off and I went inside for a few minutes.
Nobody was there.
They're supposed to be working.
My mother had a Glamour magazine.
I started leafing through it.
Glamour?
- So one thing led to another.
- What did she do?
First she screams, "George, what are you doing?
My God"!
Looked like she was gonna faint.
She started clutching the wall, trying to hang onto it.
I didn't know whether to keep her from falling or zip up.
- What did you do?
- I zipped up.
- So she fell?
- Yeah.
Well, I couldn't run over there the way I was.
- No, I guess you couldn't.
- I wouldn't think so.
So she fell, and then she starts screaming, "My back, my back"!
I picked her up.
I took her to the hospital.
- How is she?
- She's in traction.
- I'm sorry.
- It's not funny, Elaine.
I know.
I'm sorry.
It's serious.
Her back went out.
She's gotta be there for a couple of days.
All she said on the way over in the car was, "Why, George, why"?
I said, "Because it's there".
Glamour?
I'll tell you this, though: I am never doing that again.
What?
You mean in your mother's house or altogether?
- Altogether.
- Give me a break.
Yeah, right.
- You don't think I can?
- No chance.
- You think you could?
- I could hold out longer than you.
Care to make it interesting?
Sure.
How much?
Hundred dollars?
You're on.
Wait a second.
Wait a second.
Count me in on this.
You?
You'll be out before we get the check.
I want in on this.
- No, no.
- It's apples and oranges.
- It's different.
- Why?
Why?
- Because you're a woman.
- So what?
It's easier for a woman not to do it than a man.
We have to do it.
It's part of our lifestyle.
It's like shaving.
That is such baloney.
I shave my legs.
Not every day.
- You wanna be in?
- Yeah.
You gotta give us odds.
At least 2-1.
You gotta put up $200.
No.
A thousand.
No.
I'll put up 150.
- All right.
You're in for 150.
- Okay, 150.
How we gonna monitor this?
Obviously, we all know each other very well.
I'm sure we'll all feel comfortable within the confines of the honor system.
All right.
Come on.
No, Ma.
I'm not gonna see a psychiatrist.
I don't care if you do pay for it.
No.
Discussion over.
Yeah, all right.
I'll see you later.
Yes, of course I'm gonna come by.
All right.
My mother wants me to see a psychiatrist now.
Why?
Because she caught me?
You know, if everyone who did that had to go see a psychiatrist Yeah?
Whatever.
- How is she?
- She'll be fine.
I gotta go see her at the hospital.
- Yeah?
- It's me.
Come on up.
- Hey, what are you doing tonight?
- Date with Marla.
- Oh, the virgin?
- Yeah.
Any progress there?
What's the latest?
I got my troops amassed along the border.
I'm waiting for someone to give me the go-ahead.
Hey, look at this.
Come here.
There's a naked woman across the street.
Where?
Second floor from the top.
See the window on the left?
Who walks around the house like that?
Maybe she's a nudist.
You know those nudist-colony people.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Let me ask you, in these nudist colonies do they eat naked in the dining room?
I would imagine it's all naked.
Are the chambermaids naked too?
They're naked.
The gardener's naked.
Bellhops.
It's one big nude-o-rama.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Well, where's my money?
Who caved?
- Not me.
- Not me.
- What are you looking at?
- A naked woman across the street.
This is gonna be the easiest money I've ever made in my life.
My friend Joyce is teaching an aerobics class.
I'm gonna go tonight.
Yeah, well, the waitress should've taken it back.
Then, I got a call this morning.
I was chosen to go on the space shuttle.
- We're going to Mars.
- Have a good time.
I'm out.
What?
Yeah, I'm out.
I'm out of the contest.
- You're out?
- Yeah.
Wow, that was fast.
Well, it was that woman across the street.
You know, you better be careful, buddy.
She'll get you next.
And then there were three.
I don't understand you.
I really don't.
You have nothing better to do at 3:00 in the afternoon?
I go out for a quart of milk.
I come home and find my son treating his body like it was an amusement park.
Ma Don't give me "Ma".
It's good I didn't hit the table.
I could have cracked my head open.
People can hear you.
Too bad you can't do that for a living.
You'd be very successful at it.
You could sell out Madison Square Garden.
Thousands of people could watch you.
You could be a big star.
All right.
That's enough.
I want you to go see a psychiatrist.
No!
I am not going to see a psychiatrist!
- Why not?
Why won't you go?
- Because I don't want to.
- I want you to go see somebody.
- Well, I am not going.
It's a good thing your father's in Chicago.
Hello, Aunt Estelle.
Look at you.
- How did this happen?
- Is that important, really?
What is this, a police investigation?
She's been through enough.
She has to relive the experience?
Hi, Denise.
6:30, time for your sponge bath.
Is it 6:30 already?
I fell asleep.
So, George what are you doing now?
I hear you got some kind of television writing thing.
Yeah.
Television.
Let me help you off with that.
Here, just slip it over your head.
Well, it's about time.
We thought you were gonna wind up on the street.
So what is it you're doing, exactly?
George, your cousin Shelly is talking to you!
So when was the last time you took a class?
- It's been a while.
- Are you psyched?
Yeah.
I'm really psyched.
You're gonna thank me for getting you in here.
- Why is that?
- See the guy with the dark hair and the red shorts?
Oh, my God.
John F. Kennedy Jr. is here.
- He's gonna be in your class today.
- In my class?
John Kennedy's gonna be in my class?
I can get you a spot right behind him.
He has got a great butt.
Yeah.
Butt, butt.
Great butt.
John-John's butt.
- Let's slow it down a little.
- Slow it down?
Well, you know.
Yeah.
I know.
You're okay with that, right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Of course.
You think I care about the sex?
What kind of person do you think I am?
That doesn't mean anything to me.
I don't care about that.
I'll see you Saturday night, then?
Sure.
Saturday night.
- All right, then.
Good night.
- Good night.
Not just a good night.
A great night.
Good morning.
Yeah, good morning.
Nothing like some good, solid sack-time.
She's not there.
She's doing her wash.
So did you make it through the night?
Yes, I'm proud to say I did.
So you're still master of your domain.
Yes.
Yes, I am.
Master of my domain.
But I will tell you this: I am going over to her apartment and I'm telling her to put those shades down.
Wait.
What did you just say?
I can't take it anymore.
She's driving me crazy.
I can't sleep.
I can't leave the house.
I'm climbing walls.
I'm dating a virgin, I'm in this contest.
Something's gotta give.
Do you hear what you're saying?
Can you hear it?
This is a beautiful woman walking around naked and you wanna tell her to stop?
That's the dumbest thing I ever heard!
It's incomprehensible I won't let you.
- I'm doing it.
Get out of my way.
- No, no.
You can't.
This is something that comes about once in a lifetime.
When we were boys looking through our windows we'd think, "Why can't a woman out there take her clothes off"?
Now that wish has come true, and you wanna throw it away?
- I'm sorry.
- I'm not gonna let you do it.
- Kramer, get out of my way.
- Don't do it.
For my sake.
God knows, I don't ask you for much.
Please, Jerry.
I'm begging you.
Please!
Come on!
Please!
- All right, all right.
- Yes!
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
She's not there.
Oh, I can wait.
The nurse was giving her a sponge bath?
Every night at 6:30.
The nurse was gorgeous.
Then I got a look at the patient.
I was going nuts.
I guess you'll be going back to that hospital.
Well, my mother, Jerry.
But are you still master of your domain?
I am king of the county.
- You?
- Lord of the manor.
John F. Kennedy Jr. What?
He was in my aerobics class.
Really?
Did you talk to him?
No, you don't understand.
He was working out in front of me.
After the class was over, I timed my walk to the door so we'd get there at the exact same moment.
And he says to me, "Quite a workout".
"Quite a workout"?
- What did you say?
- I said, "Yeah".
Good one.
Listen, listen.
Then I showered, and I dressed and I saw him again on the way out.
So we're walking and talking, and he asked me my name and I think I said Elaine, but I mean, who the hell knows?
So then he says to me: "Do you wanna split a cab uptown"?
And I said, "Sure," even though I was going downtown.
So we get in the cab, and I mean, I have no idea where I'm going, right?
But this is John F. Kennedy Jr. we're talking about.
So he says, "Where do you live"?
I was close to your block, so I said your building.
He dropped me off in front and then I had to take a cab all the way back downtown to my house.
Oh, God.
The question is are you still master of your domain?
I'm queen of the castle.
You're back.
Of course I'm back.
Why wouldn't I be back?
My mother is in the hospital.
I'm gonna pay her a visit.
I know, but two days in a row?
You didn't have to do this.
You're my mother.
What wouldn't I do for you?
You know what you could do?
I haven't eaten lunch or dinner.
I can't eat this hospital food.
Maybe you could run down to the deli and get me a sandwich.
You got it, Ma.
A little later.
Could you go now, Georgie?
I'm very hungry.
I'm weak.
Wait a while.
What's the difference?
I don't understand why you can't do this for me!
I just got here, Ma.
I'd like to spend a little time with you.
But if you wait, they won't let you back in!
Visiting hours are almost over!
Ten minutes.
Here.
Have some Tic Tacs.
Get the hell out of here.
I'm sorry you came.
George.
I'm hungry.
Hang on, Ma.
Hang on.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Did you get your hair done today?
No, I just fixed it a little bit.
You-know-who isn't here.
He was in the early class today, but I think you made quite an impression on him yesterday.
What?
What?
Who?
Me?
- What impression?
- Let me put this back.
No, no, now!
Tell me now!
What did he say?
- He asked about you.
- He asked about me?
John Kennedy asked about me?
What did he say?
He wanted to know your situation.
- What?
I have a situation?
- I said you were single.
- That was good.
That was very good.
- He said you were just his type.
Okay.
You're trying to hurt me?
You're trying to injure me?
He told me to tell you he'll be in your neighborhood tomorrow around 9:00.
He'll stop in front of your building if you wanna come down and say hello.
All right, Ma.
I'll talk to you later.
Nothing.
I'm watching Tiny Toons here on Nickelodeon.
I like kids' shows.
They have a very innocent, wholesome quality.
Okay.
All right, talk to you later.
Bye.
Yeah, that's good.
That's good.
That's very, very good.
It's hot in there, so just walk around.
Yeah.
Don't be ashamed.
Don't be ashamed.
That's good.
Yes, yes, yes.
The woman across the block Has nothing on Nothing on, nothing on The woman across the block Has nothing on, nothing on All through the day All you got is instant coffee?
Why don't you get some real coffee?
I don't keep real coffee here.
I get my coffee on the outside.
Yeah!
- It's Elaine.
- Come on up!
- Where did you get those socks?
- I don't know.
- I think those are my socks.
- How are these your socks?
I don't know, but those are my socks.
I had a blue-striped pair just like that, and now I don't have them anymore.
Yeah, you fell asleep on the sofa, and I took them off your stinking feet!
They looked so good, I had to have them!
- Well, they're my socks!
- They're my socks!
- Oh, boy.
Oh, boy.
- What are we doing here?
- This is ridiculous.
- You believe this?
We're fighting.
I haven't been myself.
I've snapped at everybody.
I'm yelling at strangers on the street.
Hello.
You caved?
- It's over?
- You're out?
Oh, my God.
The queen is dead.
I figured you'd cruise, at least through the spring.
- What happened?
- It was John-John.
- John-John.
- John-John.
But you made it through the day before.
But he told Joyce that he wants to meet me outside here at 9:00 tonight.
- Why outside here?
- Because he thinks I live here.
Remember the cab?
He dropped me off out front.
He's picking me up.
All right, Costanza it's you and me.
And then, there were two.
Elaine Benes Kennedy Jr. Let's go in the bedroom.
- Really?
- Yes.
- You sure?
- Yes.
- You really want to?
- I do.
I'm ready.
Okay.
I know how difficult this must have been for you.
You don't know the half of it.
- What do you mean?
- It's kind of silly, but Contest?
A contest?
This is what you do with your friends?
It was just a bet.
It actually started with George and his mother.
I don't wanna hear another word!
To think how close I came to you being the one!
I must have been out of my mind.
Marla.
Hi.
I'm glad I ran into you.
I don't wanna have anything to do with you or your perverted friends.
Get away from me.
You're horrible, horrible.
All of you.
- What happened?
- I told her about the contest.
Boy.
She's a wacko.
- Hey, what happened?
- What?
- You were meeting Kennedy.
- He didn't show.
Yeah, he did.
What?
He's out there?
- Oh, my God.
I gotta go.
- No, no, he just left.
- What?
- He was talking to Marla.
Marla?
She was, like, crying.
He was consoling her.
She got into his car, and they just drove away.
- He left with Marla, the virgin?
- Yeah.
- They drove away?
- Yeah, drove away.
- You know, I said hello to him.
He's - Oh, my God in heaven.
Is that?
Kramer?
He's waving.
Oh, John that was wonderful.
Men wanna see women naked.
Whatever it is you won't show us that's what we're obsessed with seeing.
If women always wore hats in public, all the time you'd see men buying Playhead magazine you know, Skulls of the Big 10.
This would be what we're interested in.
What about cultures, like in National Geographic where everybody is naked?
What are men in these cultures trying to look at when the women walk by?
How could you have a strip club there?
Woman takes off the necklace and the nose ring, that's it, show's over.
The men are going, "Boy, did you see that little indentation in her lip?
I told you, man, this place is hot"!
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Everything on planes is tiny.
Tiny food, tiny liquor bottles, tiny pillows tiny bathroom, tiny sink, tiny soap.
Everyone's in a cramped seat working on a tiny computer.
Always a small problem.
"Be a slight delay.
You'll be a bit late.
If you could be a little patient.
We're just trying to get one of those little trucks to pull us a little closer to the Jetway so you can walk down the narrow hallway.
There'll be a man in a tight suit.
He'll tell you you have little time to make your connecting flight.
So move it".
Hey, could you do me a favor?
Could you shut up?
Open the window, please.
It's hot in here.
- You're wearing that heavy jacket.
- Fine, I'll take it off.
Grab the wheel.
- I don't want to do that.
- Come on.
Just do it.
- No, I don't like to do this.
- Elaine, just get it.
- My hand is stuck.
- Okay, don't fool around.
- My hand.
My hand!
- Don't Jer All right, fine.
Elaine.
Hey, guess what.
- This window doesn't work.
- I hate rental cars.
Nothing ever works.
Window doesn't work.
Radio doesn't work.
And it smells like a cheap hooker.
Or is that you?
Give me 10 bucks and find out.
So this worked out pretty good.
Them giving me an extra ticket.
You get a trip to St. Louis.
I did my gig.
- You got to see your sister.
- Yeah, it worked out good.
- And here's the beauty.
- What?
George is picking us up at the airport.
- Get out of here.
Why?
- You know that awning outside my building?
- Yeah.
He always brags about his vertical leap so I bet him 50 bucks that he couldn't touch the awning.
- So, what happened?
- He didn't come within 2 feet of it.
He's waving at it.
So I told him if he picks us up at the airport, he wouldn't have to pay me.
Hey, how we doing on time?
Timed out perfectly.
Drop off the car, pick up the rental-car shuttle, we walk on the plane.
- Wait up!
- Wait up!
- Sorry.
- Wait!
- Where you going?
- JFK.
I need some small bills for a tip, got any?
- Yeah.
You want a 5?
- Give me a 10.
- You're giving him $ 10?
- Well, we got three bags.
- That's a pretty big tip.
- That's what they get.
- They don't get that much.
- Let's ask him.
- You can't ask him.
- Let's see what he says.
- Jerry, we don't have time.
- Two seconds.
Excuse me.
My friend and I were having a discussion.
We were just wondering what you usually get for a tip.
- Depends on the person and the bag.
- How about people like us?
People like you?
Not much.
You don't know what you're doing.
- Come on, seriously.
- Well, since you asked.
Usually, I get $5 a bag.
- What?
- That's right.
- Five dollars a bag?
I don't think so.
- Look, you asked, I told you.
You got some nerve trying to take advantage of us.
All right, look, we're late.
Thank you very much.
- You're lucky I don't report you.
- Come on.
JFK.
Honolulu.
Wait up.
See?
Never be late for a plane with a girl.
Because a girl runs like a girl, with the little steps and the arms flailing out.
You wanna make this plane, you gotta run like a man.
Get your knees up!
- The flight's been canceled?
- Everything into JFK is booked.
Wait, I have two seats into La Guardia but they're not together.
It's boarding now.
- We'll take them.
- We won't sit together?
So what?
It's not long.
You'll read.
What about George?
He's picking us up at Kennedy.
- We'll call him.
- There's no time.
- Is there time?
- There's no time.
There's no time.
We'll call him from the plane.
I have one seat in first class and one in coach.
The price is the same because your flight was canceled.
Well I'll take the first class.
- Jerry.
- What?
Why should you get the first class?
Elaine, have you ever flown first class?
- No.
- All right, then.
You won't know what you're missing.
I've flown first class, Elaine.
I can't go back to coach.
- I can't.
I won't.
- You flew here coach.
- Yeah, that's a point.
- All right, fine.
I don't care.
The plane crashes, everybody in first class is gonna die anyway.
Yeah, I'm sure you'll live.
Third row, right.
Oh, you're in here, sir.
Welcome aboard.
Bon voyage, Lainey.
Oh, excuse me.
Excuse me, Miss.
I think you're sitting in my seat.
What?
- Yeah, 13C.
That's me.
- Sorry.
No, that's all right.
I never check my bags.
Can't stand that waiting in the baggage area.
Great.
Help me.
Excuse me.
I think you're in my seat.
Oh, really?
My mistake.
My mistake.
Thank you.
- Hey, thanks for coming with me.
- Oh, yeah.
What made you think you could touch that awning?
I confused it with another awning.
Man.
- So how we doing on time?
- We're perfect.
I timed this out so we'd pull up at the terminal exactly 17 minutes after their flight is supposed to land.
That gives them enough time to get off the plane pick up their bags, and be walking out of the terminal as we roll up.
I tell you, it's a thing of beauty.
I cannot express to you the feeling I get from a perfect pickup.
- What are you doing?
- What?
What are you getting on the Long Island Expressway for?
You know what the traffic will be like?
This is a suicide mission!
- Will you relax?
- I had it perfectly timed out.
The Grand Central.
The Van Wyck.
You've destroyed my whole timing.
This is the best way to go.
Do you know what happens if I miss him?
I don't get credit for the pickup, and I lose my $50.
George, there's no traffic at this time.
Come on.
Really?
If anything, we'll probably get there early.
I'll have a chance to go to the duty-free shop.
- The duty-free shop?
- Yeah.
Duty-free is the biggest sucker deal in retail.
- You know how much duty is?
- Duty?
- Yeah.
You know how much duty is?
- No, I don't know how much duty is.
Duty's nothing.
It's like sales tax.
Well, I'd still like to stop at the duty-free shop.
I like to stop At the duty-free shop I like to stop At the duty-free shop I like to stop At the duty-free shop So he says, "Squeeze your breasts together".
And I say, "I thought this was an ad for shoes".
Oh, my.
- Is that the new Esquire?
- Yeah.
Turn to page 146.
Coming out of the shower.
Good thing they gave you that washcloth to cover yourself up.
What is this an ad for?
See those wrinkled jeans slung over the chair?
Way in the background, out of focus?
How does it look on your side?
We'll get there.
Oh, look at this.
He's sleeping, and I have to go to the bathroom.
Maybe he'll wake up soon.
What if my kidneys burst?
Is it worth it not to wake this man up to damage a major organ?
I hope this disgusting slob appreciates what I'm doing for him.
Yeah, make a little more noise with your gum.
That's helpful.
They're not here.
You cost me 50 bucks.
Look at you.
You run like a girl.
Come on.
Run like a man.
Lift your knees.
We're wasting our time here.
We're a half-hour late.
They probably took it off the board!
No, there it is.
Right there, 133.
And it's canceled.
Canceled?
Do I still get credit for the pickup?
- I was here.
- Let's check at the ticket counter.
There it is, honey.
Gate 18A, 8:30.
Did you see that guy?
- No.
What guy?
- That guy.
He was standing right here.
- No, I didn't.
Go over to the ticket counter.
I'll go to the gift shop and get a copy of TIME magazine.
There's supposed to be a blurb about Jerry.
I think he mentioned my name.
I know that guy.
Yeah.
Gotta get my TIME magazine.
Never miss my TIME.
Okay, get your magazine.
Let's get out of here.
Hey.
I was gonna take that.
Gee, I'm sorry.
I got here first.
- I don't care.
I want the magazine.
- Okay, let's go.
You don't understand.
There's a blurb about me in this.
A blurb?
You're a blurb.
Check out the cover, idiot.
- Let's go.
- Just give me second.
- I want the magazine!
- No.
You know what I would do to you if I wasn't in these shackles?
But you are, Blanche.
You are in the shackles.
You little son of a Oh, I can't wait to read my TIME magazine.
Last copy too.
Maybe I'll read it tomorrow, in the park.
Supposed to be a beautiful day.
Have a nice life sentence, that is.
You miserable They're on a different flight.
They're scheduled to land in half an hour at La Guardia.
La Guardia?
Right, come on.
- Wait a second.
- Come on.
- Where do I know that guy from?
- We gotta go, come on.
Wake up, you human slug.
Wake up.
Wake up!
I can't hold it anymore.
Excuse me.
I've gotta go to the bathroom.
I've gotta go to the bathroom.
I'm sorry.
Can you move that?
Would you move your seat up, please?
Oh, my, that is refreshing.
Would you care for some slippers?
- Sounds lovely.
- Here you are.
Thank you very much.
May I?
Please.
Why, it's a perfect fit.
You must be Cinderella.
My name is not mentioned in this blurb.
- That's it.
It's Grossbard.
- Do you believe this?
- Nowhere to be found.
- I knew that face looked familiar.
- It's Grossbard.
- Who's Grossbard?
When I lived on Third Avenue and 18th Street, 20 years ago I had this roommate who was always behind in his rent.
One month, he asked me to loan him his share of the rent, 240 bucks.
He took the cash and disappears.
I tried to find him.
I went to his girlfriend's house, even his family.
Never got that money back.
He screwed me.
And that's the guy.
John Grossbard.
Kramer, come on.
It was 240 bucks 20 years ago.
- I'm gonna turn around, get that guy.
- You can't.
- Let go of me.
- Kramer, you cannot go back.
Kramer, you cannot abandon people in an airport pickup.
It's a binding social contract.
We must go forward.
Not back.
Tia, did you see all the flowers in that bathroom?
- It's like an English garden in there.
- They're beautiful.
They're gardenias, mostly.
- I thought I smelled lilac.
- Yes, there are a few of those too.
It's almost overwhelming.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the captain.
Due to equipment problems on the runway at La Guardia we've been instructed by the tower to reroute and land at JFK.
We apologize for any inconvenience.
What did he say?
What did he say?
- Well, you're not gonna believe it.
- What?
The plane's rerouted back to Kennedy.
We got 45 minutes.
Let's go.
Listen to the bell, Grossbard.
It tolls for thee.
We have some delicious Chateaubriand.
My personal favorite.
Or if you prefer something lighter a poached Dover sole in a delicate white-wine sauce with a hint of saffron.
Oh, saffron.
That sounds good.
And today we're featuring wines from the Tuscany region.
- Tuscany.
- Tuscany.
Hi.
Can I get to my seat?
You're just gonna have to wait.
I'm right there.
You just passed it.
I'm sitting next to that guy.
You're not supposed to get up during the food service.
Well, nobody told me that.
Look.
This plane is full.
I got a lot of people to serve.
Now, please.
You're just gonna have to wait.
There it is.
Gate 46.
We got plenty of time.
Grossbard's plane leaves in 10 minutes.
I've still got time to catch him.
How?
He probably boarded the plane already.
Give me your credit card.
- My credit card?
- Give it to me.
Don't ask questions.
I'm not giving you my card unless you tell me what it's for.
To buy a ticket to get on that flight.
You'll spend more for the ticket than you'll get from Grossbard.
I'm not gonna use the ticket.
I'll get my money, get off the plane, turn your ticket in for a refund.
Not gonna cost you a dime.
- Come on, give me the card.
- This is a great idea.
Here.
Use this one.
I get frequent flyer miles with every purchase.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Get two tickets.
You're returning it anyway, what's the difference?
- I'll get double the bonus miles.
- Yes.
Yes.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry to make you do this, but I got stuck in the aisle.
The flight attendant wouldn't let me through.
There's no way to get around that cart.
You're not supposed to get up during food service.
I'll try and remember that.
Where's my meal?
He asked me.
But you were gone so long, I thought you switched seats.
Excuse me.
Excuse me, I didn't get a meal.
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.
I would know if a tray of food had been served to me.
- Would you?
- Yes.
Well, the only meal left is a kosher meal.
A kosher meal?
I don't want a kosher meal.
I don't even know what a kosher meal is.
I think it means when a rabbi has inspected it or something.
No, no, it all has to do with the way they kill the pig.
- Come on, but they don't eat pigs.
- They do if it's killed right.
- Under a rabbi's supervision.
- Oh, you know what?
I ordered the kosher meal.
- Then why didn't you take it?
- I ordered it six weeks ago.
I forgot.
You're eating my food.
Hey, I got earplugs to collect.
Do you want it or not?
- This is the best sundae I've ever had.
- Oh, man.
You know what?
They got the fudge on the bottom.
You see?
That enables you to control your fudge distribution as you're eating your ice cream.
I never met a man who knew so much about nothing.
Thank you.
- More anything?
- More everything.
Look.
I did good.
I got supersavers.
Come on.
Supersavers?
Are they refundable?
You bought nonrefundable tickets.
You idiot.
She talked me into it.
Said it was the best deal.
- Do you know how much this'll cost?
- I'll tell you what.
I'll split it with you, huh?
- Listen, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
- Okay, okay.
Hey.
- How about that, huh?
- Excuse me?
- Do you recognize me?
- No.
- Come on.
Twenty years ago.
- What?
- Eighteenth Street?
- I don't know what you're talking about.
Give me your money.
Where's your wallet?
The $240.
Just a minute.
Hey, buddy.
Kramer!
George!
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
What?
Oh, no, nothing for me, thank you.
I'm fine.
What is your name?
Elaine Benes.
You're going to have to go back to coach.
But there was nobody sitting here.
Yes, but you're still not allowed.
These seats are very expensive.
No.
Please don't send me back there.
I'll do anything.
It's so nice up here.
It's so comfortable up here.
I don't wanna go back there.
Please, don't send me back there.
Oh, you got cookies.
You're going to have to go back to your seat.
Okay, fine.
I'll go back.
You know, our goal should be a society without classes.
Do you realize the people up here are getting cookies?
!
What is all the racket back there?
You're trying to relax on the plane, and this is what you have to put up with.
What is going on?
Sir, this woman tried to sneak into first class.
Oh, you see, that's terrible.
The problem is that curtain is no security.
There really should be a locking door.
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
Hey!
Come on.
Let go of me.
I'm telling you, I didn't do anything wrong.
- That guy owes me 240 bucks.
- Listen, pal, you're in big trouble.
Couldn't be.
Where are they already?
I don't see them anywhere.
I got my bags.
I'm ready to go.
Yeah, you got your bags.
That was the worst flight I've ever been on in my entire life.
Yeah, me too.
- I'll call you.
- Okay.
It's a business thing.
Hey.
- You guys ready?
- Yeah.
Where's George?
Kramer!
But I have to admit that I like flying.
I like those little bathrooms that they have on the plane.
It's like a small apartment of your own on the plane.
You go in, close the door, the light comes on.
It's like a surprise party every time you go in there.
But the worst way of flying, I think, is standby.
You ever fly standby?
It never works.
That's why they call it "standby".
You end up standing there going, "Bye.
I didn't Yeah".
I was on this plane where the flight attendant It was her first day on the job.
So they didn't have a uniform for her yet.
And that really makes a big difference.
Here's just some regular person coming over, going: "Would you bring your seatback all the way up"?
"Who the hell are you"?
She says, "I'm the flight attendant".
"Yeah, well, then I'm the pilot, all right?
So why don't you sit down?
I'm about to bring her in".
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
So I went to a fashion show.
The concept of modeling is counterproductive to the fashion industry.
Because when these women are around, who's looking at clothes?
I didn't notice any of the clothes.
We're all applauding.
Yeah.
What are we applauding?
"There's great-looking women here.
This is great.
I'm glad I'm here with all these great-looking women".
Anybody can design a shirt.
It takes talent to get all these girls in one spot.
That's talent.
What is this goofy walk that the models do?
You know this walk that they do down the runway?
Like they have to go somewhere.
They're walking like they're really on the way somewhere.
Then they get to the end, and it's like: "Well, I guess I'll just go back".
I loved her, Jerry.
I loved her.
No, you didn't.
- And she loved me.
She really did.
- No, she didn't.
What am I gonna do now?
I can't live without Susan.
I gotta get her back.
How?
How am I gonna to get her back?
Not only didn't you love her, you didn't even like her!
- Who says?
- You did!
A beautiful, successful, intelligent woman's in love with me.
And I throw it all away.
Oh, boy.
Now I'll spend the rest of my life living alone.
I'll sit in my disgusting little apartment watching basketball games, eating Chinese takeout walking around with no underwear because I'm too lazy to do the laundry.
You walk around with no underwear?
What do you do when you run out of laundry?
I do a wash.
Who am I gonna meet that's better than her?
No one, Jerry.
No one's better than her.
When you were with her, you said you couldn't stand her.
I loved her.
You said going up the steps to her apartment was like being taken to a cell.
I would give anything to be going up those stairs again.
I gotta call her.
Should I call her?
I don't know if that's such a good idea.
- Why?
- You need some professional advice.
Why don't you go see Elaine's friend?
She's a therapist.
I'm not gonna see that nut doctor she went to Europe with.
No, no.
Elaine, what's the name of that friend of yours that's a therapist?
The woman.
- Dana Foley.
- Right.
Dana Foley.
- She any good?
- Yeah, she's terrific.
Why?
You thinking of going?
Tia?
Who's that?
It's that model I met on the plane.
She sent you a Christmas card?
And we're going out Saturday night.
My darling, Susan.
My darling!
- What are you doing?
- Date with Fred.
- The religious guy?
- He's not that religious.
Let us pray.
- You got any Double Crunch?
- Yeah.
Kramer, should I call Susan?
Now, what does the little man inside you say?
See, you gotta listen to the little man.
- My little man doesn't know.
- The little man knows all.
My little man's an idiot.
See, she was clever.
She put her picture on her card.
I never do anything like that.
You want a picture on a card.
I can do that.
She kept such a nice, clean apartment.
She was so sanitary.
No.
I was thinking out loud.
I don't want my picture on a card.
I'll take it.
I'll take care of everything.
She made a big breakfast every Sunday.
I don't know what she put in those eggs.
You come on over.
I'll have my cereal, and I'll take your picture.
Really?
Can you take a picture?
He takes good pictures.
He's got equipment there.
- All right.
- Yeah.
- I don't know about that outfit, though.
- What's wrong with it?
Well, we'll have to improvise.
Oh, hey If you happen to see The most beautiful girl Who walked out on me Tell her I'm sorry Tell her I need my baby Won't you tell her That I love her?
- Oh, hey - George.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
So I'm thinking of putting in a tropical-fish tank right here.
Are sure you're ready for that kind of commitment?
Well, if it doesn't work out, I can flush them down the toilet.
That's horrible.
What's the perfume you're wearing?
Oh, I completely forgot.
I want you to see this.
That Calvin Klein ad I was telling you about came out today.
- What is that smell?
- It's here somewhere.
- It smells like the beach.
- Exactly.
- Oh, my God.
Is that the new perfume?
- Yeah.
I can't believe this.
My neighbor had the idea for this perfume last year.
He met with a Calvin Klein executive.
I can't believe they stole his idea.
- Are you sure?
- And you're the model for this perfume?
That's him.
He just came home.
I'll lock the door.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey, how you doing?
Yeah, I'll see you later.
I just wanted to borrow your DustBuster.
All right, come on in.
- Just wait over here.
- What?
Just wait here, and I'll get it for you.
- Kramer, this is Tia.
- Hello.
- How tall are you?
- 5'10".
Let's see.
Come on.
Back to back.
- No, Kramer!
- What?
What's the matter?
I wanted to see how tall she was.
You're tall.
She's tall.
I'm tall.
What's the difference?
We're all tall.
- What's that?
- What?
- That smell.
What's that smell?
- What smell?
It's very familiar.
I can't put my finger on it.
It's familiar.
Oh, they're all the same.
Here.
Now, if you'll excuse us.
- Okay.
I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yeah.
- Nice meeting you.
- Nice meeting you too.
Yeah, I'll see you later.
That was close.
The beach!
You smell like the beach.
What's that perfume you're wearing?
- It's Ocean by Calvin Klein.
- Calvin Klein?
No.
No, that's my idea.
They stole my idea.
I had the idea of a cologne that made you smell like the beach.
I know.
Look at this.
That's you.
What is going on here?
The jerk!
He laughs at me.
Then he steals my idea!
I could've been a millionaire.
I could have been a fragrance millionaire, Jerry.
They're not gonna get away with this.
Hello, George.
Come in, come in.
I've heard an awful lot about you.
- Please sit down.
- Well, hello.
Specifically, the reason that I'm here I don't know what Elaine told you, but I broke up with my girlfriend a couple of weeks ago.
Actually, she broke up with me, and Well, I was the cause of it, and I just wanted to find out from you What's with this thing?
- So she broke up with you.
- Yeah, and Why won't this go down?
It's all right.
Don't worry about it.
So why'd she break up with you?
What is with this damn zipper?
It doesn't matter.
Fix it later.
Tell me about your girlfriend.
It's stuck on a piece of cloth here.
I can't get the cloth out.
- It doesn't matter - This is a new jacket.
Boy, this really burns me up.
George.
George, look at me.
Okay, forget about the zipper.
What's your girlfriend's name?
- Susan.
- Okay, we're getting somewhere.
It's just so frustrating.
It's a brand-new jacket for crying out loud.
So Fred and I are gonna do volunteer work for that church on Amsterdam.
Volunteer work.
See, that's what I love about the holiday season.
That's the true spirit of Christmas.
People being helped by people other than me.
That makes me feel good inside.
Oh, look at what we have here.
A Christmas card from Lainey.
Thank you.
You didn't have to go to that trouble.
It was no trouble.
My assistant did the whole thing.
- How'd the picture come out?
- Oh, you know.
It's a picture.
Oh, look at that.
Looks good.
Kramer did a good job.
Yeah, well, how hard is it to take a picture?
- What?
- Did you look at this picture carefully?
Carefully?
Because I'm not sure, and correct me if I'm wrong but I think I see a nipple.
- What?
- Here, take a look.
What is that?
Oh, my God!
That's my nipple!
- That's what I thought.
- That's my nipple!
My nipple's exposed!
I sent this card to hundreds of people.
My parents.
My boss.
Nana and Papa.
- Didn't you look at the picture?
- Oh, God, I didn't notice.
What am I gonna do?
You know, your whole life, you go through painstaking efforts to hide your nipple, and then boom.
Suddenly hundreds of people get their own personal shot of it.
Hey.
- Have you seen the card?
- What card?
- My Christmas card.
- Yeah.
Of course, I took it.
Did you notice anything unusual about it?
- No.
- Well, come here and take a look.
- Yeah, so?
- So, what's that?
- That's a nipple.
- Right.
- Oh, great.
Didn't you see that?
- No, I didn't notice it.
It's because you made me wear that stupid shirt.
Well, maybe no one noticed it.
You didn't notice it.
- Let's see if Newman sees it.
- No, I don't want him looking.
What's the difference?
Everybody else has it.
Give me that.
Oh, my God, I sent one to the super in my building, my mailman.
My 10-year-old little nephew.
Sister Mary Catherine, Father Chelios.
Oh, my God, Fred.
I sent one to Fred.
- Okay, what is it?
- Here.
Take a look at this card.
Tell me if you notice anything unusual.
Yeah, your nipple's showing.
Okay, thanks.
- Anything else?
- No.
All right.
See you later.
What?
So what?
It's a nipple.
It's a little brown, circular protuberance.
What's the big deal?
Everybody's got them.
Look, I got them.
- I got them too.
- Look at this.
Everybody's got them.
See, it's kind of gotta little piece of cloth that's stuck underneath and Well, can you pull it up a bit?
Well, here you hold it.
Wait, hold it.
Hold it.
Damn it.
I can't move it.
God, I've never seen a zipper so stubborn.
Damn it.
I almost had it.
Okay.
Wait, that'll separate it.
- Let me try.
- Take it off the track.
You're gonna rip it.
You're gonna rip it.
I'm afraid we're gonna have to stop now.
Okay.
My mother is gonna pay for the session.
Oh, is this Elaine?
Yeah.
No!
No!
No.
Oh, no.
I've called every day for four days.
She hasn't returned one call.
Was it a scratch or a pick?
It was a scratch.
Hey, it's me.
Don't you think I know the difference between a pick and a scratch?
- Yeah.
- It's me.
Come on up.
Was there any nostril penetration?
There may have been some incidental penetration but from her angle, she was in no position to make the call.
So let's say, in her mind, she witnessed a pick.
- Okay, so then what?
- Is that so unforgivable?
Is that like breaking a commandment?
Did God say to Moses, "Thou shalt not pick"?
I guarantee you Moses was a picker.
You wander through the desert for 40 years with that dry air.
You telling me you're not gonna have occasion to clean house a little?
Let me ask you something.
If you were dating somebody and she did that, would you continue going out with her?
No.
That's disgusting.
You cannot believe what I am going through.
That card is plastered all over the office.
Everybody's calling me "Nip".
Yeah, that's my new nickname at the office.
Nip.
These guys keep asking me out for drinks.
Not only that.
Fred, you know, the guy I told you about he hasn't called me in three days.
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.
How come I didn't get a Christmas card?
Everybody else got one.
Jerry got one.
Kramer got one.
I thought we were good friends.
I don't get a Christmas card.
I don't get it.
You want a Christmas card?
You want a Christmas card?
All right, here.
Here's your Christmas card.
You got any Double Crunch?
Yeah, I think I do.
- What's that perfume?
- It's the ocean.
That's mine.
That's my smell.
Jerry, get that model to get me an appointment with Calvin Klein.
I can't.
She won't return my calls because she caught me in a pick at a light.
- I thought you said it was a scratch.
- That's not what she thinks.
Call her agency.
Maybe she's been out of town and didn't get the calls.
Get it.
All right.
I'll call the agency.
Hello.
I'm trying to get in touch with Tia Van Kamp.
Do you know if she's been in town?
Oh, really?
- Well, thank you very much.
- What?
She has been in town.
She's at Calvin Klein right now.
Let's go.
It'll be different this time.
I promise.
I promise difference.
I'm committed to difference.
I need someone a little more stable.
I'm not stable?
I'm like a rock.
I take these glasses off, you can't tell the difference between me and a rock.
I put these glasses on a rock, you know what jumps into people's minds?
Costanza.
- People don't change.
- I change.
I change.
Two weeks ago, I tried a soft-boiled egg.
Never liked it before.
Now, I'm dunking a piece of toast in there and loving it.
I'm not a soft-boiled egg.
And I am not a piece of toast.
I just don't think that we have anything in common.
That's okay.
That's good.
You think Louis Pasteur and his wife had anything in common?
He was in the fields all day with the cows and the milk examining the milk, delving into milk, consumed with milk.
Pasteurization.
Homogenization.
And she was in the kitchen, killing cockroaches with a boot on each hand.
Why were there so many cockroaches?
Because there was a lot of cake lying around the house just sitting there with all the excess milk from the all experiments.
- And they got along?
- Yes.
Yes.
She didn't know about pasteurization.
He didn't know about fumigation.
But they made it work.
- You can't go in.
- I want to talk to Calvin.
- Let me talk to Calvin.
- Wait.
- I just want to talk to Calvin.
- Kramer?
- Oh, Tia, hi.
- Who are you?
I'm here to talk about the ocean.
Oh, yes, Kramer.
I think I know something about this.
Would you excuse us, Tia?
- I don't want any trouble, Calvin.
- Neither do I. Hello.
There you are.
Hello.
What are you doing here?
I had to talk to you.
You haven't returned my calls.
Well, I've been busy.
I thought we had a good time.
The only explanation I could come up with is you think that you caught me I'd rather not talk about this.
But I was clearly on the outer edge of the nostril.
- I know what I saw.
- But there was no pick.
I did not pick.
There was no pick.
- I gotta go.
- No.
No pick.
Now here's the scoop, Calvin.
I came in here last January to talk to one of your flunkies.
Interesting face.
And when I told him my idea about the beach cologne you know, he laughed at me.
You're very lithe, aren't you?
Very graceful.
Well, yeah.
- Sit down.
- All right.
You're very lean.
But muscular.
You know, I try to take care of myself.
I watch what I eat.
Just recently, I cut out fructose.
I think you're spectacular.
I told you, Fred.
My friend's next-door neighbor took it.
So, what happened?
Well, l I must have missed a button.
I forgot to button it.
I really don't see how you could miss a button like that.
Oh, you've never missed a button?
- Yeah.
- It's your sister, Gail.
Oh, God.
My nephew.
Hi, Gail.
Yeah.
Yes, Gail, I know how old he is.
Hey, Nip, you need that manuscript, or can I take it?
Take it.
Take it.
And stop calling me Nip.
It was an accident.
Well, it's gotta be somewhere.
Look under his mattress.
About the focus group?
I have nothing to do with the focus group.
Oh, yeah.
He's sexual athletic and without a trace of self-consciousness.
His buttocks are sublime.
His pectorals could use some work.
Get him into the weight room.
No.
Let's get him in the studio today.
We could send these out immediately.
You've done it again, C.K. And what if I did do it?
Even though I admit to nothing and never will.
What does that make me?
I'm not just defending myself, but all those pickers who have been caught.
Each and every one of them who has to suffer the shame and humiliation because of people like you.
Are we not human?
If we pick, do we not bleed?
I am not an animal.
I did not bare myself deliberately, but I tell you, I wish now that I had.
Because it is not me that has been exposed, but you.
For I have seen the nipple on your soul!
So the minute I started up the steps to her apartment I knew I made a terrible mistake.
Going back with her.
So we're in her apartment.
She goes into the bathroom.
I'm cursing myself.
Now how do I get out of there?
And then it hits me like a bolt of lightning.
The pick.
- The pick?
- The pick?
She comes out of the bathroom, I'm in up to my wrist.
You should've seen the look on her face.
I think I've seen that look.
Hey, I got the magazine.
The underwear ad came out.
Hey, Calvin Klein!
- Hey, you look great!
- Neat.
Boy, they really worked on your pectorals.
- Well.
- Your buttocks are spectacular.
- Oh, my.
- What?
Well, I'm not sure but I think I see your The human body is a lot of maintenance.
A lot of showering, a lot of shaving, a lot of cleaning, a lot of clipping a lot of checking.
If your body was a car, you wouldn't buy it.
It's too much upkeep.
It's a pain.
But women definitely go to the absolute extreme.
To me, it's amazing the way women take care of all the hair on their bodies.
One of the great mysteries to me is the fact that a woman could pour hot wax on her legs rip the hair out by the root and still be afraid of a spider.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
What are lawyers really?
To me, a lawyer is basically the person that knows the rules of the country.
We're all throwing the dice, playing the game moving our pieces around the board, but if there's a problem the lawyer is the only person that has read the inside top of the box.
I think one of the fun things for them is to say "objection".
"Objection!
Objection, Your Honor".
"Objection," of course, is the adult version of "afraid not".
To which the judge can say two things: He can say "overruled," which is the adult version of "afraid so".
Or he can say "sustained," which is the adult version of "duh".
So So you're a lawyer.
What kind of cases do you handle?
Oh, everything.
Divorce, patents, immigration and naturalization.
What is that?
lmmigrants come over, you show them how to act natural?
Are your friends as funny as you?
No, they're not funny at all.
No.
I have no funny friends.
I'm the funny one.
El Clown-o.
Look, I was nice enough to pick it up for you.
Hey, I've been back four days.
I want my mail.
It's mostly bills, magazines and junk mail anyway.
Elaine, that's what mail is.
Without bills, magazines and junk mail, there is no mail.
- Here's my card.
- Oh, okay.
Thank you.
- Hey, good talking to you.
- Nice meeting you.
- Hi.
- Hey, how you doing?
You would not believe what just happened.
I was waiting for you, and this woman was sitting at the counter.
- What, the one who just left?
- Yeah.
And so we started talking and she's this lawyer, who's incredible.
You know, everything I said was funny.
She laughed at everything I said.
She thinks I'm hilarious.
You know, in a way, it was almost too good.
I started so good, I can't go anyplace but down now, you know.
I got no place to go.
Yeah, well, guess it's all over.
Hey, is that Babu?
- It is.
Hey, Babu!
- Jerry.
Look at you.
You got the job.
- Yes, they give me job, thanks to you.
- Oh, I didn't do anything.
No, you do everything.
Get me job, get me place to live in your building.
- Come on.
- You very good man.
- Stop.
- You did everything for me.
I can never thank you enough for everything you do.
You see, this is what I do with women.
I start out too strong.
Now I have to become real.
That's when it all falls apart.
What good is real?
They don't want real.
They want funny.
- No, they don't.
No.
- Oh, yes, they do, Elaine.
Oh, you gotta put on a show.
You always gotta give them a big show.
You always have to be on.
Otherwise, why would they like me?
They'd just go for a better-looking guy with more money.
You mean that's true?
I'm right?
Okay, great.
Well, I'm glad everything worked out, Babu.
- Yes.
Everything wonderful.
- I'll see you around the building.
I'll see you in the building.
- Remember Babu Bhatt?
- Who's he?
Remember that guy, opened the restaurant across the street from the building last year and he wasn't doing so well?
I told him he should make it into all-Pakistani.
- It drove him right out of business.
- Right.
So you going with me to the auto show Saturday?
- Yeah, yeah.
- Can you bring my mail then please?
- What mail?
- I picked up his mail while he was on the road.
- Why didn't Kramer pick it up?
Because he was at that baseball fantasy camp in Florida.
Oh, yeah, right.
When's he coming back?
- Monday, I think.
- Kramer goes to a fantasy camp.
His whole life is a fantasy camp.
People should plunk down $2000 to live like him for a week.
Do nothing, fall ass backwards in the money mooch food off your neighbors and have sex without dating.
That's a fantasy camp.
Listen, if you're gonna go out with this lawyer, have dinner with us then maybe you can go to the auto show with her if you want.
Have a little company.
Take the pressure off.
He never heard of corduroy!
Stop it, you're killing me!
Never heard of corduroy.
True story.
True story.
Funny.
- No.
No, I don't I don't think so.
- Why?
Well, I think I'm better off going one-on-one.
I don't know why you wanna play man-to-man when you could play zone.
She might not be comfortable.
Why?
We're all very nice.
We're very friendly.
- We'll be funny.
- No.
No.
It's not good.
I don't think so.
All right.
If you change your mind, we'll wind up at Isabella's around 7.
No.
No Isabella's.
I don't want to go to Isabella's.
- Why?
- No, it's too trendy.
No Isabella's.
Excellent.
Like I really know what I'm talking about.
Toasting makes me uncomfortable.
But toast I love.
Never start the day without a good piece of toast.
In fact, let's toast to toast.
Look who's here.
Georgie boy.
What are you doing here?
I thought you said you hated Isabella's.
No, I talked him into it.
What happened to the auto show?
Oh, we're still going.
Still going.
Elaine, do the spokesmodel.
The turbo quadramatic transmission offers you the power and prestige to propel you well into the 21 st century.
Hi.
- Hi.
- Cheryl, this is Elaine and Jerry.
Hi.
Nice to meet you.
- Would you like to join us?
- No, no.
They don't wanna join us.
- No, it's okay.
Don't be silly.
- Okay.
Why don't we put these tables together.
You can't do that.
They're round.
It makes an eight, and it just Jerry.
Jerry, tell them that funny story you were telling me No.
No.
No, George, it's so funny.
We saw this cab driver's picture, right?
You know, we should really order.
The service is so slow here.
By the time you get anything Oh, Cheryl, can I ask you a legal question?
- I'm being sued.
- Oh, what happened?
Well, I ran out to apologize to a virgin, and I crossed against the light and I knocked over the delivery boy.
Was he Chinese?
Yeah.
Is your?
Is your last name "Benes"?
- How did you know?
- Oh, God!
Ping is my cousin.
No.
- That's so funny.
- I'm handling his case.
What?
- You're Cheryl Fong?
- That's right.
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, God.
I can't believe it.
This is such a coincidence.
I know.
Wow.
Well, l I guess you don't have any advice for me on how to win the case.
Will you excuse me?
I have to make a call.
Tell Ping I said hello.
Tell him you think you may have broken the case wide open.
I can't believe it.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
- What?
- This is not good.
This is not good.
- What's the matter?
- I don't think it's a great idea for you to sit here.
- Why not?
He thinks if you're too funny, he might not look so funny.
Biff.
What?
- You're not worried about that?
- No, of course not.
I mean, so what if I'm funny.
Who cares?
He thinks that if a woman sees a guy put on a better show she'll walk out on his show, go see the other show.
Well, should we leave?
Well, maybe you don't have to be so funny.
Would it kill you not to be so funny all the time?
That's all I'm asking.
This woman thinks I'm very funny.
Now you're gonna be funny, so, what am I gonna be?
I'll be a short, bald guy with glasses who suddenly doesn't seem so funny.
This is so ridiculous.
Can we just go over there?
Look, I don't have to be funny.
I don't care.
- You don't?
- No way.
It's completely under my control.
No, it's not.
You cannot not be funny.
Of course I can.
Am I being funny now?
A little.
Oh, this is funny?
I'm being funny?
Yeah.
George, is this funny?
It's funny.
And it wouldn't kill you to not be so funny either.
What?
What did I do?
- Hi.
- Hi.
Hello.
Welcome back.
I'm sorry.
It was my aunt's birthday.
She makes such a big deal about it.
Well, nobody likes to get old, right?
Well, birthdays are merely symbolic of how another year has gone by and how little we've grown.
No matter how desperate we are that someday a better self will emerge, each flicker of the candles on the cake we know it's not to be.
But for the rest of our sad, wretched, pathetic lives this is who we are to the bitter end inevitably, irrevocably.
Happy birthday?
No such thing.
Funny guy, huh?
Here, take it.
I was glad to get rid of it.
Well, thank you very much.
It's about time.
Oh, listen.
So guess what.
Cheryl convinced Ping to drop the case against me.
Drop the case?
Wow, congratulations.
That will save you some money.
Yeah.
No kidding.
That lawyer was gonna charge me a fortune.
Oh, great.
Birth announcement from Arnie and Joy Harris.
Hear that?
Guess who's back.
Thought you weren't coming back till Monday.
Well, the camp ended a few days early.
Why?
Well, there was an incident.
What happened?
I punched Mickey Mantle in the mouth.
- What?
- Yeah, I punched him and they took him to the hospital and then they canceled the rest of the week.
You punched who in the mouth?
Mickey Mantle.
What happened?
Well, you know, we were playing a game and I was pitching.
I was really throwing some smoke.
And Joe Pepitone, he was up and, man, that guy, he was crowding the plate.
Wow, Joe Pepitone.
Well, Joe Pepitone or not, I own the inside of that plate.
So, you know, I throw one inside, you know.
A little chin music right on his pants because I gotta intimidate, you know, when I'm on the mound.
Well, the next pitch, he's right back in the same place.
So I had to plunk him.
- You plunked him?
- Oh, yeah.
Well, he throws down his bat, he comes racing up to the mound.
Next thing, both benches are cleared, you know.
A brouhaha breaks out between the guys in the camp, you know and the old Yankee players.
As I'm trying to get Moose Skowron off of one of my teammates somebody pulls me from behind and I turned around and I popped him.
I looked down and whoa, man!
It's Mickey.
I punched his lights out.
Wow, this is incredible.
Leave me alone!
You can't do this to me.
What's going on out there?
What are you doing?
This is not right, people.
You're making a very bad mistake.
Very bad.
Babu.
I'll be right back.
- Yeah, so - Hank Bauer, he's screaming: "Mickey!
What have you done with Mickey!
You killed Mickey"!
- So, what did you do?
- Well, I got the hell out of there.
They took Babu away.
They took Babu away?
Yeah, the immigration guy said his visa was expired.
Poor Babu.
Everything was going so well for him.
He had an apartment, he had a job.
- What a shame.
- Jerry!
Help me!
I will, Babu!
I will help you, Babu!
Don't worry!
Then Hank Bauer, you know, he's chasing me around.
He trips over third base and knocks over Clete Boyer.
What?
- Well, this is interesting.
- What is it?
It's a letter from the lmmigration Bureau.
It's Babu's visa-renewal application form.
They must have put it in my mailbox by mistake.
Well, doesn't he need that?
If you'd given me my mail last week, this never would have happened.
Well, you should have come to my house to pick it up.
- So am I being funny now?
- No, actually, you're not.
See, I told you I wasn't funny all the time.
Hey, George, look, I'm not funny now.
No, and you weren't funny last night.
You got us both so depressed she asked me to drive her home after dinner.
I need to get in touch with Cheryl.
Babu needs a lawyer.
His visa's expired.
There's a million lawyers.
Yeah, but you said this is one of the things that her firm does.
All right, but no funny business.
Same deal as last night.
- Will you stop it already.
- Jerry, please.
How long is this gonna go on?
Till I'm comfortable.
Well, when is that gonna be?
After consummation.
Consummation?
I don't think you have enough material.
I have a friend in the immigration department who owes me a big favor.
You're very lucky.
That's wonderful news.
Thank you.
You're a very serious person, aren't you?
Well, with so many people in the world deprived and unhappy it doesn't seem like it would be fair to be cheerful.
I understand.
I think that's curdled.
I don't care.
Do you ever laugh?
Not really.
Sometimes when I'm in the tub.
That's so sad.
What do you do?
I'm a comedian.
Oh, let me get that.
You've been so helpful.
Hey, we're gonna go see Babu now, right?
Yeah, I'll just pay for this.
I'm just gonna say hi to Cheryl.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Listen, gosh, I wanted to thank you so much for convincing Ping to drop the case.
After we met, you were all so nice, I just couldn't go through with it.
But between you and me, you would have paid through the nose.
- You're kidding.
- No, I'm not.
- Babu.
- Jerry!
Jerry.
Hello, Jerry, - You remember Elaine.
- Yes, yes, of course.
- Nice to meet you.
- So nice of you both to come.
- Oh, Babu.
- No, you're both very kind.
Very kind.
- Oh, well, you know, we try.
- We do what we can.
- We do what we can.
- See the problem is, I never got my visa-renewal form in the mail.
- I was expecting it.
- Yes.
See, here's the thing, Babu.
What happened was I was away for a couple of weeks doing some comedy shows.
The comedy shows, you're very funny man.
Well, Elaine, here, was picking up my mail while I was away because that little box can get very full.
Yes, of course.
TV Guide, magazines, everything.
I would have picked up your mail.
- Your box is right next to mine.
- I don't want to bother you.
No bother.
You get me job.
You get me apartment, you very good man.
Well, yesterday, after they took you away I looked in my mail, and I noticed that the mailman accidentally put your visa-renewal in my mailbox.
Come again?
See, I've been home for a week and Elaine didn't give me my mail till yesterday even though I asked her repeatedly for it.
Yeah, but, Babu, he could have come to my house to pick it up.
You had my visa application?
- Well, not technically.
- I kill you!
- What about her?
- I kill both of you!
- Babu.
- No Babu.
No Babu.
You're bad man.
You're very bad man.
You're very lazy, bad man.
Babu, I'm gonna fix everything.
I have a lawyer who knows someone in the immigration department.
They'll straighten the whole thing out.
The wheels are in motion.
Things are happening as we speak.
- The wheels are in motion?
- The wheels are in motion.
Things are happening.
Jerry?
I'm very attracted to him.
You think the person you were talking to was him?
That's not even close to him.
He's funny.
Jerry's funny.
- He's never said anything funny.
- He can't not be funny.
No, no.
He's dark and disturbed.
Dark and disturbed?
His whole life revolves around Superman and cereal.
What kind of a friend are you?
I convinced him to act like that so that you would think I was funnier.
That's how disturbed I am.
You want disturbed?
That's disturbed.
I mean, you can't find sickness like that anywhere.
You think sickness like that grows on trees?
Nobody is sicker than me.
Nobody.
He's pretending.
I am the genuine article.
You're telling me Jerry's whole thing was an act?
And I put him up to it, because I'm sick.
I'm the one that needs help.
I gotta go.
Well, should I call you later?
Please don't.
But But I'm disturbed.
I'm depressed.
I'm inadequate.
I got it all!
So, what's up with Babu?
How come he's not back?
I don't know.
I don't understand it.
Cheryl was supposed to take care of it.
He should be back by now.
- Yeah?
- George.
- Come on up.
- Babu.
- Babu, what happened to you?
- Babu must be back.
- Well, where's Babu?
- He is in Pakistan!
- Who are you?
- I am his brother.
He knew a lawyer.
It was all going to be fixed.
I'm sure the lawyer did everything they could.
Then where is Babu?
What happened to Babu?
Show me Babu!
- Snapple?
- No.
Too fruity.
Hey, what happened?
I thought Cheryl was gonna help Babu get his visa.
- She didn't help him?
- No.
- Where is he?
- He's in Pakistan.
Oh, boy What do you mean, "Oh, boy"?
Well, last night she told me that she liked you.
Not you, the disturbed you.
So I had to tell her the truth.
You told her the truth?
Well, you got Babu deported!
What do you mean I "got"?
You didn't give him his visa application.
That's because she had my mail.
Well, I wouldn't have to get your mail if he didn't go to that fantasy camp.
Well, I just came back from Mickey Mantle's restaurant.
How could you go in there?
Well, I had to.
I had to apologize.
I mean, I punched Mickey Mantle, my idol.
It was eating me up inside!
Well, what happened?
I got down on my knees, and I went, "Go ahead, Mickey, hit me.
I'm begging you, Mickey.
Please, hit me.
Come on, hit me.
I love you, Mickey.
I love you".
So, what did he do?
Well, the four of them, they picked me up by my pants and they threw me outside, right into a horse.
- Kramer.
- Hey!
Yeah.
It's my Chinese food.
Oh, Ping.
Hi.
Listen, thank you so much for dropping that lawsuit against me.
- Not anymore.
- What?
Cheryl call me last night.
Lawsuit back on.
Why?
She call you and your friends big liars.
You think she nice girl?
Wait till you see her in court.
She's a shark!
They call her "The Terminator".
She never lose a case, and now you make her mad.
She doubled the damages.
Hasta la vista, baby.
So his friend had the mail, but she did not give it to him.
And then he came to visit me said a lawyer would call and help.
He said the wheels were in motion.
But there was no motion.
There was nothing.
And so they sent me back here.
This is a terrible story, Babu.
What are you going to do?
I'm going to save up every rupee for someday I will get back to America, and when I do I will exact vengeance on this man.
I cannot forget him.
He haunts me.
He's a very bad man.
He's a very, very bad man.
I am for open immigration but that sign we have on the Statue of Liberty: "Give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses".
Can't we just say, "Hey, the door's open, we'll take whoever you got".
Do we have to specify the "wretched refuse"?
I mean, why don't we just say: "Give us the unhappy, the sad, the slow, the ugly people that can't drive, that they have trouble merging if they can't stay in their lane, don't signal, can't parallel park if they're sneezing, if they're stuffed up, if they're clogged if they have bad penmanship, don't return calls, if they have dandruff food between their teeth, if they have bad credit, if they have no credit missed a spot shaving".
In other words any dysfunctional, defective slob that you can somehow cattle prod onto a wagon send them over, we want them.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
The age-gap hiring policy at movie theaters: They never hire anyone between the ages of 15 and 80.
Know what I mean?
The girl that sells you the tickets, she's 10.
Then there's the guy that rips it, he's 102.
What happened in the middle?
Couldn't find anybody?
It's like they want to show you how life comes full circle.
You're 15.
You're selling tickets.
Then you leave.
You go out, you have a family, kids, marriage, career, grandchildren.
Eighty years later, you're back at the same theater 3 feet away, ripping tickets.
Took you 80 years to move 3 feet.
The show's delayed?
Why?
I don't know.
Diane told me to hold it for 15 minutes.
But I got this all timed out.
I got another spot across town at 9:50.
I'm not gonna make it.
- I hear you, guy.
- And I'm doing Letterman Monday.
You know, I gotta work out the material.
Let me see what I can do.
Oh, no, Buckles?
You're not putting him on tonight, are you?
No.
He hangs around in case somebody drops out.
Look, why don't you come back and do the 11:00 spot.
I was supposed to meet my friends to see this movie Checkmate at 10:30.
All right, forget the movie.
I'll do the 11:00 spot.
I'll be back.
- Hey, Jer.
- Hey.
Excuse me.
Do you have a ticket?
- No.
- Okay.
Good.
You missed your spot.
It was 9:15.
But, Maurice, I'm positive you told me 9:50.
In any event, I had no alternative but to reassign your spot to one of your peers who possesses a clearer understanding of our scheduling policies.
- Jerry!
- What are you doing here?
Hey, do you think this is funny?
Why do they call it "athlete's foot"?
You don't have to be an athlete to get it.
I mean, my father gets it all the time and, believe me, he's no athlete.
- I gotta go.
- Wait.
Where?
- The movies.
- I thought you told Kernis you were going back to do the 11:00.
I'm just gonna stop by and tell my friends I can't make it.
- Cool.
I'll split a cab with you.
- I could be a while over there.
I got time.
It'll give us a chance to get to know each other a little better.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Where is everybody?
- Everybody's late.
Because they know I'll get in line early.
I've been dying to see Checkmate.
Well, if it's as good as Ponce de León, I'll be happy.
Ponce de León?
Are you kidding me?
I hated that movie.
Ponce de León?
But that was great.
Oh, come on.
That fountain of youth scene at the end where they're splashing around and they go running over to the mirror to see if it really worked.
I mean, come on.
It's so stupid.
Let me tell you something: When Ponce looked in that mirror and saw that he hadn't changed and that tear started to roll down his cheek, I lost it.
- Oh, there you are.
- Where have you been?
Around the corner at the Paradise Twin.
- Well, I told you the Paragon.
- No, you said Paradise.
- It's playing there too, you know.
- No.
I would not have said Paradise.
That's a twin theater.
I want to see this movie on a big screen.
I'm gonna get a hot dog at Papaya King.
- You'll never make it back in time.
- I haven't had any dinner.
You can get a hot dog at the theater.
I don't want a movie dog.
I want a Papaya King hot dog.
Kramer, Jerry is gonna be here any second.
Then this line's gonna start moving, and we'll end up in the front row.
- Just save me a seat.
- No, I don't wanna save seats.
Don't put me through that.
I once had the fleece ripped out of my winter coat in a seat-saving incident.
- Give me my ticket, then.
- Well, I don't have them yet.
You don't have them yet?
Well, I'm in line to buy.
No, George, this is a ticket-holders' line.
No, it's not.
It's the ticket-buyers' line.
- Then how come we're not moving?
- Good question.
Is this the ticket-holders' line or the buyers'?
Holders'.
When I asked you before if you had a ticket, you said no.
I didn't.
My friend was getting it.
That's good.
It's good to be accurate.
Stay here.
I'll go get tickets.
- Can you believe him?
- He spaced out.
And how long would you have stood in the ticket-holders' line?
Yeah, exactly.
It's sold out.
Oh, real good, George.
Real good.
Hey, I asked the guy if he had a ticket.
- All right, what time is it?
- Twenty after 10.
They got one at the Paradise at 10:45.
No, I don't wanna go to a miniplex multi-theater.
It's the same movie.
What's the difference?
No, it's not a theater.
It's a room where they bring in POWs to show them propaganda films.
All right, I'm going.
It's in Dolby.
Well, what about Jerry?
You go get the tickets.
I'll wait for him.
- Terrific.
All right, come on.
- All right.
So then, when I was 12, the whole family moved from Bensonhurst to Sheepshead Bay.
We were right on the water.
The whole atmosphere stunk from fish.
You know that fishy smell I'm talking about?
Yeah, yeah.
The fishy smell.
To this day I won't eat fish.
- Do you eat fish?
- Yes!
Yes, I eat fish!
- I don't know how you eat that crap.
- Take the Park.
No, no, take 55th.
No, there's beautiful homes there.
There's lovely, talented, attractive people.
You'll thank me.
Jerry, I want you to do me a favor: No more fish.
Okay.
I get your point.
I have a point?
- Got them.
- Beautiful.
Hey, you know what else is playing here?
Rochelle Rochelle.
- I wouldn't mind seeing that.
- Yeah.
Men can sit through the most pointless, boring movie if there's the slightest possibility that a woman will take her top off.
So, what's your point?
By the way, you owe me $ 7.50.
- All right.
Can you break a 20?
- No.
I don't have any change.
Well, then I'll pay you later.
Or I could take the 20, and I could pay you later.
Yeah, you could.
Might be easier.
Well, how's that easier?
I mean, then you would owe me $ 12.50 instead of me owing you $ 7.50.
- Either way.
- Yeah, it's the same thing.
So can I have it?
I tell you what, I'll get the popcorn and the soda.
What do you mean, you'll get the popcorn and the soda?
I will buy your popcorn and soda, and we'll call it even.
Tell you what.
Give me the 20, I'll buy you a popcorn and soda and I'll throw in a bonbons.
- George, you're sapping my strength.
Come on.
Go.
What about Kramer and Jerry?
I'll wait here for them.
You go save seats.
Me?
But that's three seats.
I can't save three seats.
I told you about that guy who tore up my coat.
- Save them, go.
- No, but George Fifty-Fifth Street.
Great idea.
Saturday night, theater traffic.
Good move.
I wonder how lke Turner would react in traffic.
"You better move that car, girl, before I bust you up".
And what about Jose Feliciano?
"It's not bad enough that I can't see, I have to sit here for two hours.
I don't think so".
It can be anybody.
People down through history reacting in traffic.
Franklin Roosevelt: - "Driver" - All right, all right.
I got the bit.
Jerry, I want you to have this piece of material.
That's nice of you.
I can't do the voices.
Jerry, don't start up with me.
I gotta get out of this cab.
But, Jerry, we're riffing.
No, I'm not riffing.
I'm ignoring.
Do you understand the difference?
Can you help me get on The Tonight Show?
No, these are saved.
- All of them?
- Yeah.
- You can't take four seats.
- What, is that a rule?
- Are these your things?
- Yeah.
Elaine, I can't wait anymore.
I'm gonna miss the beginning.
Well, we'll take these seats.
Would you please remove your stuff?
- No, no, they'll be here.
- But I am here.
They are not.
They're coming.
George, listen, run over to the Paragon and give Kramer the two tickets so they can come in.
These are taken.
Taken.
If you hurry back, you won't miss the beginning.
You go, and I could save the seats.
You don't like saving anyway.
No, taken!
Taken, taken.
I'm getting the hang of it.
Why don't you give me the 20, I'll stop and get change and then you and I can, you know, settle up.
Can we do this later, George?
What's the point of discussing it anymore.
You'll give me the money when you have it.
I trust you.
Will you do me a favor?
You see a guy who's about 5 foot 11 he's got a big head and flared nostrils tell him his friend's gonna be right back, okay?
No, I'm sorry.
These are taken.
They're in the lobby buying popcorn.
What are you doing?
These are taken!
- Which one?
- These two and this one.
No, don't come over here!
These are taken.
Go!
Go!
These are taken.
They're taken!
They're taken!
Oh, take them.
Excuse me, have you seen a guy with, like a horse face, big teeth and a pointed nose?
- Flared nostrils?
- Yeah.
Nope.
Haven't seen him.
Jerry, could you do me a personal favor?
And if I'm out of line, please let me know.
Could I keep my trench coat in your closet for a few months?
Your trench coat in my closet?
Jerry, my closet is packed to the gills.
I'm afraid to open the door.
Just for a few months.
It'll make all the difference in the world.
I can't keep your coat in my closet.
- I'm sorry you feel that way.
- Well, that's how I feel.
Hey, your friends aren't here.
They must be inside.
I'm gonna run in and tell them I can't make the movie.
We should go see Rochelle Rochelle.
I hear it's really hot.
- No, thanks.
Maybe some other time.
- Really?
Do you mean that?
No, I don't.
But you like the athlete's-foot bit, right?
No.
No.
I was kidding.
It was terrible.
Here you go.
I'll see you later.
- Do you want me to wait for you?
- No.
Don't wait.
Jerry, I'll wait just to make sure you get in, that's all.
I got friends inside I need to get a message to.
You mind if I walk through real quick?
Go ahead.
Bye-bye.
Hey, did that guy show up?
The guy with the horse face and the big teeth?
No, the guy with the big head and the flared nostrils.
Haven't seen him.
There was a short guy with glasses looked like Humpty-Dumpty with a melon head.
But he left.
So I got home, and he was vacuuming.
I mean, he's 12 years old.
Who else but my Alan would do something like that?
And then last night, he put on my high heels.
He put on such a show for us.
He was dancing around, lip-synching to A Chorus Line.
I mean, you can see he's got talent.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
What's the problem?
You're talking.
It's the coming attractions.
So anyway, he sings, he dances.
And you know what he's gotten into now?
He is cooking.
He does a great Ticket, sir?
I just went out.
I went to look for my friend.
Do you have your stub?
My stub?
Who keeps the stub?
No one holds on to the stub.
I'm going to the movies for 25 years, nobody ever asked me for the stub.
- You don't remember me?
- It's a big city, sir.
I went in with a pretty woman.
You know, short, big wall of hair, face like a frying pan.
Nope.
- I can't find it.
- I can't let you in without your stub.
All right.
Here.
It's my friend's ticket.
Elaine?
- Elaine?
- Sit down!
- Elaine?
- Hey, shut up!
I'm looking for my friend.
Check the bathroom.
You're bothering us.
I know my friend's here.
What do you want me to do?
You can shut up!
- Elaine?
- Shut up!
Elaine?
Elaine?
The Village Voice calls it a masterpiece.
A young woman's strange, erotic journey from Milan to Minsk.
It's a story about life and love and becoming a woman.
Rochelle Rochelle.
Now playing at the Paradise Two.
Thank you.
Can I have a medium Diet Coke?
- You want the medium or middle size?
- What's the difference?
Well, we have three sizes: medium, large and jumbo.
What happened to the small?
There is no small.
Small's medium.
So, what's medium?
Medium's large, and large is jumbo.
- Okay, give me the large.
- That's medium.
Right.
Yeah.
Can I have a small popcorn?
There is no small.
Child-size is small.
- What's medium?
- Adult.
- Do adults ever order the child-size?
- Not usually.
- Okay, give me the adult.
- Do you want butter?
- Is it real butter?
- It's butter flavoring.
Yeah, well, what is it made of?
It's yellow.
Thanks.
Thank you.
You don't know how long I've been waiting out there.
Very busy tonight.
Very busy.
Where you go?
Forty-Fourth and 9th.
- Have you got a cigarette?
- No.
Ticket, sir?
We've just been through this.
You don't remember?
We just had this exact conversation a minute ago.
I need to see your stub.
I got the stub.
I got the stub.
I put it right in my pocket.
I got the I'm telling you, I got the stub.
I just - I don't know where it is.
- I can't let you in without your stub.
You just let me in.
We just did this a minute ago!
All right.
Okay.
There.
There you go, okay?
That's my other friend's ticket.
Happy now?
You got two tickets.
Two of my friends.
Ticket, sir?
No, see, my friend bought me a ticket.
See, I'm late.
She's already inside.
- Go ahead.
Enjoy the movie.
- Thanks.
- What is it, Your Majesty?
- Anyone asks - Is that seat taken?
- It's all yours.
When I tell you something, you damn better well listen.
- I'm getting tired of these questions.
- Yes, Your Majesty.
I'm sorry, Grendel, I I've been very taxed lately.
Yeah, I'm very sorry.
You give me a few minutes.
I have to stop for gasoline.
Gasoline?
Can't you get it after you drop me off?
No.
Impossible.
It is on empty.
See.
Yeah, yeah.
Okay.
What happened to my seat?
Oh, my God, where was I?
- Hey, sit down.
I can't see.
- Get out of the way.
I can't find my seat.
- Just move!
- No, you move!
Get the hell out of here!
Come, come, you're soaking wet.
Come in.
My name is Rochelle.
I'm from Milan.
I'm supposed to visit my relatives in Minsk.
Yes.
Come by the fire.
Take off those wet clothes.
You'll catch cold.
My hands are so cold, I can barely get these buttons open.
That's much better.
Much, much better.
Listen, I just went to go get popcorn and God.
I just went to go get popcorn, okay and somebody took my seat, and my coat is in there.
There's a seat in the front row.
No, no, I can't sit in the front row.
You're gonna have to wait then.
I can't stand around here for two hours.
I can let you see Rochelle Rochelle.
Thanks.
Hey, listen, by the way have you seen a tall, lanky doofus with a bird face and hair like the Bride of Frankenstein?
Haven't seen him.
Okay.
Let's go.
I'm gonna miss my spot.
Yes, yes, we go.
We go.
One minute.
I run across the street for cigarettes.
I don't have time.
I'm gonna miss my spot.
No, no.
We go very soon.
I didn't know you enjoyed chess, Your Majesty.
Why wouldn't I?
Well, because the king is always in jeopardy.
Yes, but it's only a game.
Yes, of course.
Only a game.
- Hey, did I make it?
- Sorry.
Great.
That's great.
What a night.
Pat Buckles, ladies and gentlemen.
Another round of applause for Pat Buckles.
Good set.
You got my spot?
- That athlete's-foot bit killed.
- Really?
- You think I need to lose some weight?
- Weight?
No.
You just need some height.
Jerry, don't start up with me.
What are you doing now?
What am I doing?
My whole night's ruined.
I didn't do any sets.
I didn't go to the movies.
Come on.
We can still catch most of Rochelle Rochelle.
Rochelle Rochelle?
A young girl's strange, erotic journey from Milan to Minsk.
Minsk?
My father was a shoemaker.
He worked hard, and we didn't have much money.
Rochelle, Rochelle, what are we going to do with you?
- I'm going away tomorrow.
- Where?
Where are you going?
I want to go with you.
Take me with you.
Well, don't be a silly goose.
But I've never seen Minsk.
I hear there's so much hustle and bustle.
You're being absurd.
Leave me alone.
- Rochelle, Rochelle, do you know?
- Give me a break!
Elaine?
- Jerry.
- Elaine.
- Shut up.
- Jerry?
- George?
- Elaine?
George.
- But where's Kramer?
- Will you shut up?
I don't know.
Does this movie stink or what?
Let's get out of here.
I'll see you.
- You're leaving?
- Yeah.
Jerry, take the coat.
Please.
One month.
I don't want the coat.
Jerry, call me when you get home, so I know you're okay.
- What happened to you?
- I missed you at the other theater.
Then I missed my set, and I had nothing to do.
Man.
Look at this.
I sat in gum.
What happened to Checkmate?
Oh, I went out to get popcorn, and some creep took my seat.
Hey, by the way, you owe me $ 7.50.
- But I didn't even use the ticket.
- I still paid for it.
- I only have a 20.
- Hi.
- Hey!
- What happened to you?
That's my coat.
Give me that.
Where did you get that?
It was on the seat.
You took my seat?
- You owe me $ 7.50.
- Yeah.
Right.
What is this stain?
It's yellow mustard.
Can you break a 20?
But I always get confused in the movie theater by the plot.
It's embarrassing to have to admit, but I'm the one you see in the parking lot, after the movie, talking with his friends, going: "You mean, that was the same guy from the beginning"?
Nobody will explain it to you.
In the theater, you can't find out.
Why did they kill that guy?
Why did they kill him?
Who was that guy?
Who was that guy?
I thought he was with them.
Wasn't he with them?
Why would they kill him if he was with them?
Oh, he wasn't really with them.
I thought he was with them.
It's a good thing they killed him.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
I'm tired of pretending I'm excited every time it's somebody's birthday.
What is the big deal?
How many times do we have to celebrate that someone was born?
Every year, over and over.
All you did was not die for 12 months.
That's all you've done, as far as I could tell.
I love the astrology things that tell you the people that have the same birthday as you.
It's always an odd group of people to it.
It's like Ed Asner, Elijah Muhammed and Secretariat.
I don't wanna live.
I don't wanna live!
Because of me?
You must be joking.
Who wouldn't wanna live because of me?
- I'm nothing.
- No.
- You're something.
- You can do better than me.
You could throw a dart out the window and hit someone better than me.
I'm no good.
You're good.
You're good.
I'm bad.
I'm bad.
You're killing me!
So what could I do?
I couldn't go through with it.
She threatened to kill herself.
Over you?
Yes.
Why, is that so inconceivable?
- Well - I'm trying to get in touch with Sharon Leonard.
She works for the NYU paper.
This is Jerry Seinfeld.
She was supposed to meet me for an interview.
Oh, what are you gonna get Jerry for his birthday?
- I got him a great gift.
- Really?
What?
I got two tickets to see Guys and Dolls.
Oh, that is a good gift.
Maybe he'll take me.
No, I'm gonna go with him.
What did you get him?
I got him a two-line phone.
Really?
That's good.
Unbelievable.
She's not there.
- What paper does she write for?
- For the NYU school newspaper.
She's a grad student in journalism.
Never been to a comedy club.
Never seen me.
Has no idea who I am.
Never even seen you?
Gotta kind of envy that.
You know, you've been developing quite the acid tongue lately.
Really?
Who do you think is the most unattractive world leader?
- Living or all-time?
- All-time.
If it's all-time, there's no contest.
It begins and ends with Brezhnev.
I don't know.
Did you ever get a good look at De Gaulle?
Lyndon Johnson was uglier than De Gaulle.
I got news for you.
Golda Meir could make them all run up a tree.
Golda Meir.
Good one, babe.
Hey, come here.
Come here.
Those two girls behind you, they're eavesdropping.
- Really?
- You know just because you two are homosexuals, so what?
I mean, you should come out of the closet and be openly gay already.
So, what do you say?
You know you'll always be the only man I'll ever love.
What's the matter with you?
- Come on.
Go along.
- I'm not going along.
I could just see you in Berlin in 1939 goose-stepping past me.
"Come on, Jerry.
Go along.
Go along".
- You're no fun.
- You know, I hear that all the time.
- Hear what?
- That I'm gay.
People think I'm gay.
Yeah, people ask me that about you too.
Yeah, because I'm single, I'm thin, and I'm neat.
And you get along well with women.
I guess that leaves me in the clear.
Hi, Jerry, it's Sharon Leonard from the NYU paper.
I'm here at the coffee shop, and I was a little late.
We must have missed each other.
- I'm going to the bathroom.
- Me too.
I'll be here for a little while longer, and I'll try to hook up with you later.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I just thought of a great name for myself, if I ever become a porno actor.
Oh, yeah?
What?
Buck Naked?
Yeah.
How did you know that?
You told me that already.
Like two months ago.
Let me ask you something.
What do you think of this shirt?
Well Allison bought it for me.
- How you gonna get out of that one?
- I don't know.
I guess I have to wait for her to die.
- Yeah?
- Sharon from N YU.
Come on up.
- Who's that?
- Oh, that's that reporter from NYU.
She's doing the interview.
I told her to come here so we won't miss each other.
- Do you want me to stay or?
- Sure, I don't care.
Hi.
Hi, I'm I'm Sharon.
Hi, I'm Jerry.
- Something the matter?
- No, no.
Nothing.
- You look familiar.
Have we ever met?
- I'm not sure.
Have we?
You look familiar.
Why don't we do this over here?
This is George.
Oh, hi.
Nice to meet you.
- He'll hang around, if that's okay.
- Sure, I'd like to talk to him too.
Oh, really?
- Okay.
- Okay.
There we go.
- Oh, is that a problem?
- No, I just hate my voice on tape.
It always sounds so high and whiny.
- Well, shall we start?
- Fire away.
Okay, let's see.
Are you just a comedian, or do you do anything else?
Well, right now George and I are writing a pilot for NBC.
Oh, so you also work together.
Yeah.
Jerry, did you wash this pear?
- Yeah, I washed it.
- It looks like it hasn't been washed.
So wash it.
You hear the way he talks to me?
You should hear how my boyfriend talks to me.
What?
Hey, let me ask you something.
What do you think of this shirt?
It's nice.
Jerry said he didn't like it.
I didn't say I didn't like it.
I said it was okay.
- Oh, you said you didn't like it.
- Oh, well, so what if I don't like it?
Is that, like, the end of the world or something?
So how did you two meet?
Oh, actually, we met in a gym locker room.
Yeah.
Actually, it was in gym class.
I was trying to climb the ropes and Jerry was spotting me.
And I kept slipping and burning my thighs.
And then finally I slipped, and I fell on Jerry's head.
We've been close ever since.
Do you guys live together?
- Live together?
- No, I got my own place.
Oh, and do your parents know?
- Know what?
- My parents?
They don't know what's going on.
You're that girl in the coffee shop that was eavesdropping on us.
I knew you looked familiar.
Oh, no!
No!
- I better get going.
- There's been a big misunderstanding.
We did that for your benefit.
We knew you were eavesdropping.
That's why my friend said all that.
It was on purpose.
We're not gay.
Not that there's anything wrong with that.
- No, of course not.
- It's fine, if that's who you are.
- Absolutely.
- I mean, I have many gay friends.
- My father's gay.
- Look I know what I heard.
- Heard.
It was a joke.
- Look, you wanna have sex right now?
Do you wanna have sex with me right now?
Let's go.
Come on!
Let's go, baby!
Come on!
Hey, come on.
Let's go.
I thought we were gonna take a steam.
- No, I don't want any steam.
- No.
No steam.
Well, I don't wanna sit there naked all by myself.
The whole thing's your fault.
You want me to talk to her?
I'd be perfectly willing to.
- I don't think so.
- Because you know me I walk into a room, problem solved.
She says she'll think about it.
So what, even if it does come out.
It'll just be in an NYU paper.
Why don't you take your jacket off?
- No, I'm okay.
- I'm gonna try her again.
Boy.
Happy birthday.
"Faruba"!
- Today's not my birthday.
- Well, I beg to differ.
Well, I think I know when my birthday is.
Yeah, well, you'd think so, but you'd be wrong.
Maybe he's right.
Maybe it is my birthday.
Would you take the jacket off?
Leave me alone.
Get off my back about the jacket.
- Oh, look at this.
A phone.
- Yeah.
A two-line phone.
That's terrific!
Thanks a lot.
Now when someone's on the phone, I can make a call.
- Yeah.
- Look, Elaine, a two-line phone.
Yeah, I see it.
I'm gonna get one myself.
Where you going?
I gotta go return something.
I got a dial tone.
- Okay, this is the maiden call.
- Yeah.
Wait, wait.
I wanna get the first call.
All right.
Go to your house.
I'll call you.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Hey, it's working.
This is great.
Thanks a lot.
- Happy birthday, buddy.
- Wait, I got a call on the other line.
- Okay, later.
- All right, I'll talk to you later.
- Hello?
- Jerry, it's Sharon from N YU.
- Oh, hi.
- I was just calling to tell you I'm not gonna play up that angle we talked about on the story.
Oh, thank you very much.
That's great.
Hold on a second.
I got a call on the other line.
- Hello.
- Hey.
How you doing?
You know I got that reporter from the newspaper on the other line.
- So, what did she say?
She said she's not gonna play up that angle in the story.
She thinks we're heterosexual.
I guess we fooled her.
All right, I'll get rid of her.
Hold on.
Sharon?
Hello?
Sharon, are you there?
- I'm back.
- You know I could hear you on the other line.
What are you talking about?
I heard what you said: "Sharon, are you there"?
You heard me talking on the other line?
Are you sure?
Yes, I heard you.
Maybe she was disconnected.
Maybe she wasn't.
Maybe she heard the whole conversation.
All right.
Let me call Kramer, and see if you can hear anything.
Hold on.
- Hello.
- There may be a problem with the phone.
Hold on.
"There may be a problem with the phone".
Oh, no!
Kramer, this phone's a piece of junk.
Goodbye.
"This phone's a piece of junk".
Oh, no!
She's heard everything!
What will we do?
She thinks we're gay.
Not that there's anything wrong with it.
No, no, of course not.
People's personal sexual preferences are nobody's business but their own.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Elaine, right?
Nice to meet you.
- Thanks for meeting with me.
- Sure.
Would you like to take a seat?
- Sure.
- Thank you.
Why don't you take your coat off?
So she kept insisting I take off my coat.
I refused, and then she forcibly tried to get me to remove it.
She didn't take her coat off in my house, either.
You know there are tribes in Indonesia where if you keep your coat on in somebody's house, the families go to war.
Give me a break.
So you don't take your coat off, and now everyone at NYU thinks I'm gay.
Not that there's anything wrong with that.
Not at all.
- Take that coat off.
- I don't want to take it off.
Take your coat off, already.
When will we see it?
I'd like to read the article.
They're sending it to me.
All right, well - Here you go.
Happy birthday.
- Thank you.
Two tickets to Guys and Dolls.
I'm gonna go with you.
Guys and Dolls?
Isn't that a lavish Broadway musical?
It's Guys and Dolls, not Guys and Guys.
You're right.
Guys and Dolls.
Thanks.
Thanks very much.
- All right.
- All right, well - Happy birthday.
- Oh, Lainey!
The Collected Works of Bette Midler.
What?
l I thought you liked Bette Midler.
She's all right.
- You said you liked her.
- Well, so what?
Maybe I do like her.
- So what?
- So nothing.
- Well, thanks for the CDs.
- Yeah, you're welcome.
Why are those two people pointing at you over there?
I don't know.
- What've you got there?
- The New York Post.
They've got an article about you.
"Although they maintain separate residences the comedian and his longtime companion seem to be inseparable".
Oh, no, The Associated Press picked up the NYU story.
That's gonna be in every paper.
I've been outed.
I wasn't even in.
Now everyone's gonna think we're gay.
Not that there's anything wrong with that.
No, not at all.
"Within the confines of his fastidious bachelor pad Seinfeld and Costanza bicker over the cleanliness of a piece of fruit like an old married couple".
I told you that pear was washed.
I thought we were friends.
Here we go.
I mean, how could you two keep this a secret from me?
- It's not true.
- Enough lying.
The lying is through.
Come on, Jerry, the masquerade is over.
You're thin, late 30s, single.
- So are you.
- Yeah.
- Hello.
- George?
Mrs. Seinfeld?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Ma?
- Jerry?
- Ma.
Oh, my God!
My mother!
- Jerry.
- Ma, it's not true.
It was those culottes you made him wear when he was 5.
They weren't culottes.
They were shorts.
They were culottes!
You bought them in the girls' department.
By mistake.
By mistake, Jerry.
I'm sorry.
It looked like he was wearing a skirt, for crying out loud.
It has nothing to do with the culottes.
Not that there's anything wrong with that, Jerry.
I open up the paper, and this is what I have to read about?
I fell right off the toilet.
My back went out again.
I couldn't move.
The super had to come and help me up.
I was half-naked.
It's not true.
Every day it's something else with you.
I don't know anything about you anymore.
Who are you?
What kind of life are you leading?
Who knows what you're doing.
Maybe you're making porno films.
Yeah.
I'm Buck Naked.
You're who?
Buck Naked?
Jerry, I can see.
He's so neat and thin.
Not that there's anything wrong with it.
Of course not.
Six-thirty, Scott.
Time for your sponge bath.
Six-thirty already?
I fell asleep.
Let me help you off with that.
Here, I'll Just slip it over your head.
- The water's nice and warm, isn't it?
- Oh, that feels really good.
George, are you telling me the truth?
George, I'm talking to you!
Guess who left a message on my machine.
That reporter from NYU.
I wonder what she wants.
All right.
Now the play is tomorrow night.
Would you like dinner first or just meet at the theater?
Excuse me, sir, I'm sorry to bother you.
I want you to know that it took a lot of guts to come out how you did and that you've inspired me to do the same even though that may mean a discharge from the service.
Thanks.
You know, I think I'll pass on the Guys and Dolls.
All right, fine, don't go.
I try and go out and do something special for your birthday and this is the thanks I get.
Everything's tainted now.
- Would you keep your voice down?
- No, I will not keep my voice down!
Nothing can make me keep my voice down!
If you boys cannot control yourselves then I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
- Fine, I'll take Elaine.
- Yes.
Just don't say anything to Allison.
No, I won't.
Did she see the article?
- No.
Just imagine her reaction.
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.
- What?
She hasn't seen the article.
When she sees it, she's gonna think I'm out, baby!
I'm out!
Yeah, so?
"Yeah, so"?
Well, this is nice.
They mention your name.
Don't you see what it says here?
Don't you understand what that's implying?
No.
What?
I'm gay.
I'm a gay man.
I'm very, very gay.
- You're gay?
- Extraordinarily gay.
Steeped in gayness.
I don't believe it.
You don't believe me, ask Jerry.
- I will.
- What do you mean, you will?
No, no, no.
That's a bad idea.
- Jerry's a very private person.
- I wanna hear it from Jerry.
Oh, can you ever forgive me?
I don't know.
All right, I forgive you.
You know, the funny thing is, I was attracted to you immediately.
I was attracted to you too.
You remind me of Lois Lane.
Jerry!
Oh, my God!
What are you doing?
What?
You're with a woman!
I know.
What are you doing here?
I leave you alone for two seconds, and this is what you do?
I trusted you!
- Would you get the hell out of here?
- Stop it.
- What?
What's going on?
- Yeah, what's going on?
All right.
Tell her.
Go ahead.
- Tell her what?
- You know, about us.
- Are you crazy?
- Tell her, Jerry.
Tell her.
I'm telling her nothing.
Do you know what you're saying?
This This is too weird.
Wait a minute.
You wrote the article.
Go ahead.
Tell her.
I'm out of here.
It's not true!
It's not true!
Not that there's anything wrong with that.
- You stupid idiot.
- Oh, please don't be upset.
Oh, would you stop it with that stuff?
What's going on?
All right, I'll tell you the truth.
I'm not gay.
My name's Buck Naked.
I'm a porno actor.
- Really?
- Oh, my God.
- Hey, how you doing?
- How you doing?
Hello.
- Hi.
How are you?
- Hi.
How are you?
All right, we'll see you later.
He's the phone man.
Not that there's anything wrong with that.
I am not gay.
I am, however, thin, single and neat.
When someone is thin, single and neat people assume they're gay because that's the stereotype.
We normally don't think of gay people as fat, sloppy and married.
Although I'm sure there are, I don't want to perpetuate the stereotype.
I'm sure they're the minority, though, within the gay community.
Probably discriminated against.
Because of that, people say to them: "You know, Joe, I enjoy being gay with you but it's about time you got in shape, tucked your shirt in and lost the wife".
If people are gonna assume that neat people are gay instead of doing this: "I think Joe might be a little" They should vacuum.
"You know, I think Joe might be" Yeah.
I got a feeling he's a little
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
The problem with the beginning of the relationship is each person has their own sexual timetable of what should happen when, that the other person knows nothing about.
That's why I think we need some sort of sexual rule book where it's written down and agreed upon sexual standard dating procedure.
Know what I mean?
So if there's any problems, you can go: "Look, honey, I'm sorry, but we've been out three times and according to Article 7, Section 5 there's got to be some physical contact, as you can see right there.
Otherwise, I will report you to the board and they can issue a warrant for an embrace".
Wait a second.
Wait a second.
Then the butler says, "I'm not cleaning it up.
- I'm sick of cleaning"!
- That's funny.
That's funny.
"I'm sick of cleaning".
That's very funny.
I've never seen a pilot script this funny.
- Yeah, it's funny.
- How funny is this?
- It's funny.
- I mean, we're not stupid, right?
- We know when something's funny.
- It cannot not be funny.
Come on, let's stay with it.
We gotta finish this today.
Maybe I should give it to my therapist to read.
- She's smart.
I trust her.
- Maybe I'll give it to Elaine.
We haven't brought the Elaine character into the show yet.
We should get her into this scene.
Right.
Right.
Okay.
"Elaine enters".
Right.
What does she say?
- I don't know.
What do women say?
- I don't know.
I don't even know what they think.
That's why I'm in therapy.
If we bring Elaine in, it'll be so many people to keep track of.
It's too hard.
I forget where everybody is standing.
You, me, Kramer, the butler.
It's too much.
- All right, forget Elaine.
- All right.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You are never gonna believe who I just ran into today.
- Who?
- Your old flame: Gail Cunningham.
Did you talk to her?
Well, I was on my way to the Y, and I saw her coming towards me.
I didn't know what to do.
I remember you had three dates with her and she wouldn't kiss you good night.
So now I'm thinking, "What is my duty to my friend?
Do I acknowledge her?
Do I ignore her"?
- I mean, what is my responsibility?
- So, what happened?
You know, she sees me and she goes, "Hi, Kramer"!
Like nothing happened.
Like she never went three dates with you and refused to kiss you.
- Yeah, I know about the three dates.
- You know what I did?
I snubbed her.
- What do you mean you snubbed her?
- I walked by her, never said a word.
- Right by her?
- Right by her.
What do you say about a guy like this, huh?
You are some great friend.
I'll tell you.
Snubbed her.
Not that I condone it.
I've never condoned snubbing in my administration.
But your loyalty is beyond question.
Well, you know, she's lucky I was in a good mood.
Could have been a lot worse.
- I'm not even in here.
- Yeah, I know.
I thought there was gonna be a character named "Elaine Benes".
There were too many people in the room.
We couldn't keep track of everybody: George and the butler You "couldn't keep track of everybody"?
Well, we tried.
We couldn't.
We didn't know how to We couldn't write for a woman.
We didn't know what you would say.
Even right now, I know you're gonna say something.
I have no idea what it is.
You have no idea?
Something derogatory?
- I thought I'd find you here.
- Well, Gail Cunningham.
- Hi, Gail.
- Hi, Elaine.
- What is with your friend, Kramer?
- Why?
He snubbed me.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.
- What did you tell him?
- Nothing.
Hey, give me that.
- I thought you finished.
- I took two bites.
How am I finished?
Plus, you're coming down with something.
You want me to get sick?
Bite?
I wanna know.
Why did Kramer do that?
I don't know.
Once he leaves the building, he's out of my jurisdiction.
- Tell him that I am mad at him.
- All right.
So where you cooking now?
- Pfieffer's.
- Oh, the power-lunch crowd.
Nice shoes.
- Thank you.
- Where did you get them?
They're Botticelli's.
Botticelli's.
Look at you.
I'm afraid to go in there.
Really?
- Would you care to join us?
- No, no.
I gotta get to the restaurant.
- See you.
- See you.
"Look at you with your Botticelli's".
- That bothered you?
- Yes, it bothered me.
So I bought a pair of shoes at Botticelli's.
I'm not allowed to shop there?
That really embarrassed me.
- It did?
- Yes.
Couldn't you see that?
No.
This is why you're not in the pilot.
Well, George, I think you're beginning to get some perspective on things.
I think we're making progress.
- Yeah, I feel like I've grown.
- Good.
Let's pick up on this next week.
Great.
By the way, did you get a chance to read the script?
Yes.
Yes, I did.
Well, what did you think?
It was good.
You didn't like it?
Well, no I can't believe this.
What was wrong with it?
What didn't you like about it?
It wasn't funny.
It wasn't funny?
What, are you kidding?
No.
I didn't find it funny.
You didn't find it funny?
This is what I'm paying for?
Well, that whole story line about a guy who gets into a car accident doesn't have insurance, so the judge sentences him to be a butler?
I didn't really buy that.
Let me tell you who did buy it.
We pitched this story to Russell Dalrymple, the president of NBC, and he ate it up with a spoon.
If you're going to be in a creative field you're gonna have to learn how to deal with criticism.
How's this for criticism?
You stink.
How do you like that criticism?
You know what's funny to me?
That diploma up on the wall.
That is my idea of comedy.
You sitting here, telling people what to do.
- I think you'd better go.
- I'm going baby.
I'm going!
It's Jerry's fault.
He took out all my good lines.
He's such a control freak.
So you send me to this therapist to help me with my emotional disorders and she criticizes our script.
What kind of a therapist is that?
Well, I guess she didn't think it was funny.
Oh, she didn't think it was funny.
What is she, Rowan and Martin?
We're supposed to meet with NBC tomorrow.
She completely shattered my confidence.
And I'm paying for this.
She's my employee.
- I thought your mother's paying for it.
- And she slaves to earn every penny so that someday I might be able to walk up to a woman and say: "Yes, I'm bald, but I'm still a good person".
He's right.
It's not her place to criticize the script.
Which reminds me.
What did you think of it?
You never told me - What did I think of it?
- Yeah.
Hey, buddy, I got something to tell you.
Now, one second.
You won't get off that easy.
Tell me what you thought.
- Well, you know - I just kissed Gail Cunningham.
- You what?
- Yeah, I kissed her.
- You kissed her?
- Right on the mouth.
What kind of great friend are you?
How do you go from snubbing to kissing?
I saw her outside the Y. She came up to me, she started yelling because I snubbed her.
Then we started talking a little bit and I walked her to her building.
And just before I left I put my arm around her waist.
I pulled her to me and I planted one.
- What did she do?
- She kissed me back.
I don't get this.
I go out with this girl three times, she won't shake my hand.
Why is she kissing you?
Because I snubbed her.
You see?
Women, they like that.
Yes, I understand women.
The snub is good.
They love the snub.
No they don't.
I tried that once.
I snubbed for a year.
Nothing.
Every woman I saw, I snubbed.
You never saw people so pleased.
So I understand you're buying new shoes now at Botticelli's.
What?
Who told you that?
Gail Cunningham.
I don't understand.
Why is this woman talking about my shoes?
Why are my shoes a topic of conversation?
We were just talking, and she mentioned how you're buying your shoes now at Botticelli's.
How I'm buying my shoes now at Botticelli's.
Did you hear this?
So what?
So what?
She is talking about my shoes.
She is discussing my shoes.
It is nobody's business where I buy my shoes.
- Hey, Gail?
- Yeah.
Elaine.
- Why are you talking about my shoes?
- What?
My Botticelli shoes.
You've been talking about my Botticelli shoes.
What are you talking about?
Did you or did you not tell Kramer that I got my shoes at Botticelli's?
Too spicy.
He wants another one.
- You got that pasta primavera?
- Elaine, I am very busy here.
Who else have you mentioned my shoes to?
I want to know why my footwear is your conversation?
I am not discussing this.
This is insane.
You got that pasta primavera?
Let's go!
Here you are, Mr. Dalrymple.
Sorry for the delay.
Enjoy your lunch.
- Well, come in.
Come in.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Sorry to make you come up here but I wasn't feeling well enough to go back to the office.
Well, it's the only chance I have to meet with you this week.
- Are you all right?
- It's my stomach.
There must have been something in the pasta primavera I had for lunch.
- Where did you eat?
- Pfeiffer's.
- I know the chef there.
- Food is usually terrific.
My cousin worked for Bouchard's.
They used to use the bouillabaise for a toilet.
What are you saying?
Well, you didn't hear it from me, but needless to say if you go in there, stick with the consommé.
We better get started.
My daughter's gonna be here soon.
Oh, you have a daughter.
- She just turned 15 last week.
- That's a fun age.
Yeah.
All right.
The script.
Now, I've read this thing three times.
Yeah?
And every time I read it What?
- Excuse me for a second.
- What?
Would you like a Pepto-Bismol?
I keep them in my wallet.
You think he liked it?
I'm not sure.
- What was that dish he said - Pasta primavera.
You know, "primavera" is Italian for "spring".
- No?
- Yeah.
Really, I'm terribly sorry.
It's just all of a sudden, it just hit me.
So you were saying, about the script.
Right.
The script.
Your script needs It needs - More jokes?
- Another ending?
A different name for the butler?
Maybe we should go.
We haven't heard his notes yet.
We don't know how he feels about our work.
Oh, no.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
I can't listen to anymore of this.
The guy's losing a lung in there.
Hello.
- Hi.
- I'm Molly.
- I'm Jerry.
- George.
We're discussing our script with your father.
He just read it.
- Daddy, are you okay?
- Yeah.
Yeah, sweetie, I'm fine.
- So you live with your mother?
- Yeah.
Divorce is very difficult, especially on the kid Of course, I'm the result of my parents having stayed together.
So you never know.
Crapshoot.
Dad, you all right?
What's the matter?
- It's just a stomach thing.
- Yuck.
We're gonna have to do this some other time.
So if you give me your number, I'll call you later.
Suddenly I'm in the mood for pasta primavera myself.
Get a good look, Costanza?
- What were you doing?
- It's not my fault.
You poked me.
You're supposed to just take a peek after a poke.
You were like you just put a quarter in one of those metal things on top of the Empire State Building It was cleavage.
I couldn't look away.
What, am I waiting to win an Oscar here?
This is all I have in my life.
Looking at cleavage is like looking at the sun.
You don't stare at it.
It's too risky.
- You get a sense of it, then look away.
- All right.
He caught me in a cleavage peek.
So big deal.
Who wouldn't look at cleavage?
She's got nice cleavage.
- That's why I poked.
- Why I peeked.
- Hi.
- Hey.
- What is with your friend Elaine?
- What?
She comes to my restaurant, comes right in my kitchen starts complaining that I'm talking about her shoes.
- She did?
- Right in the kitchen.
Disgraceful.
I don't like people coming into my kitchen.
I think she sneezed all over someone's pasta primavera.
Someone might have gotten sick because of her.
- Pasta primavera?
- Is that what she said?
Hey, she's something, huh?
She's a wild one.
She's wearing me out.
- She is?
- She's real sensual.
You know, with the cooking and all.
Hello?
Hi, Stu.
- From NBC?
- Yeah.
What's going on?
What?
Really?
Oh, my God.
Did he give you a reason?
Oh, boy.
Okay.
All right.
Thanks.
Dalrymple just canceled the pilot.
If you hadn't gone there, this wouldn't have happened.
I don't like people talking about my shoes behind my back, okay?
My shoes are my business.
You two shouldn't have been looking at some 15-year-old's cleavage.
- He poked me!
- There was cleavage in the area.
That's a reflex.
Cleavage, poke.
Cleavage, poke.
But she was 15.
You don't consider age in the face of cleavage.
This occurs on a molecular level.
You can't control it.
We're like some kind of weird fish where the eyes operate independently of the head.
What's the difference?
What are we gonna do now?
He won't take our calls.
We can't get into his office.
You know what we could do?
He eats at Pfeiffer's.
We can have Gail call us when he's there, go there and talk to him.
- You're on to something.
- The whole thing is so stupid.
Like he wouldn't do the same thing if Elaine walked by in a low-cut dress.
- Well, maybe not Elaine, but - No.
- Somebody like Gail, though.
- Yeah.
What?
What do you mean Gail?
What?
Hey, Kramer, listen, I want you to ask Gail to do me a favor.
The next time Russell Dalrymple comes in the restaurant ask her if she would call me.
- All right, I'll call her right now.
What do you mean Gail?
You don't think I can attract attention, put asses in the seats?
Look, sweetheart, you know you've got it all.
But let's face it - She said she'll do it.
- All right.
- Great.
Beautiful.
- Beautiful.
But she wants the shoes.
- What?
- She says she wants those shoes.
She wants my shoes?
What kind of person is this?
- She is not getting them.
- Come on, I'll buy you another pair.
No, these were the last pair of these that they had.
- I'll get you another just like it.
- But these were the only cool ones.
Don't you see how everybody likes them and everybody talks about them?
Elaine this pilot, it doesn't matter to me.
It's not me I'm concerned about it's my mother.
She's already been in the hospital this year.
- Yeah, because she caught you - Never mind!
Oh, come on.
Wait a second.
This whole thing is ridiculous.
How do I even know she wears the same size?
- All right, what size are you?
- Seven and a half.
Bingo.
Sauce this.
Yeah, he's here.
Oh, and one more thing, bring the shoes.
Hey, will you look!
Fancy meeting you here.
Hello.
Pasta primavera.
Back on the horse.
It's funny, after the pilot got canceled, we hadn't heard from you.
- We didn't hear anything.
- We were wondering what happened.
Well, it just didn't seem to be the right project for us right now.
So, what were you saying?
The show.
Because if it had anything at all to do with what you perceived as me leering at your daughter, I really have to take issue with that.
- I did not leer.
Did I leer?
- No leer.
Excuse me.
- Are you using that ketchup?
- No.
Because if I'm looking straight ahead and something enters my field of vision that's merely a happenstance.
Look, under the circumstances I don't really feel that we should be in business together.
Here's your ketchup back.
You know, I had the hardest time trying to get some out.
I just kept pounding and pounding on the bottom of it.
- Do you ever have any trouble?
- No.
Do you have a ketchup secret?
No Don't have a ketchup secret.
Because if you do have a ketchup secret I would really, really like to know what it is.
Field of vision, huh?
How's everything?
- Really good.
- This pasta primavera is fabulous.
- Very tasty.
- How did it go with that NBC guy?
Great.
Pilot is back on.
In fact, Elaine's going out with him tomorrow night.
Hey, listen, Elaine if Russell mentions anything about the pilot you'll, of course, tell him how much you liked it.
You know I happen to have the script right here with me and on page three, for example suppose the Elaine character comes in wearing a low-cut dress and the butler is very distracted and can't work.
That kind of comedy, that's a little broad for us.
I'm sure it's right up Russell's alley.
- Well, it's a funny idea.
- It's funny.
- Come on, funny is funny.
- Funny's funny.
We're here to entertain, right?
All right.
Well, maybe I'll mention it to Russell tomorrow night.
- lf you can.
- Yeah.
- Where is he taking you, by the way?
- Bouchard's, on 53rd.
I think what he's trying to say is, "Get the bouillabaise".
Men are obsessed with cleavage, women are obsessed with shoes.
It's the same for both sexes.
It doesn't matter how many times we've seen these things.
Every time these objects are presented to us we have to look.
We cannot not look.
To men, cleavage is like the nearest thing to a nearby UFO landing.
That's what it is.
Women, if women buy a pair of shoes that they really love this is like boarding the alien ship.
It's possible that aliens have landed and they haven't been able to get our attention because we're so preoccupied with cleavage and shoes.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
The life expectancy now is 72, I think, for men.
Seventy-five or six or something for women.
It's amazing to think that a couple thousand years ago life expectancy was 30.
Which, in our terms, would mean you get your driver's license around 5 you'd marry at 9, divorced at 15.
In your late teens, you move down to Florida.
I guess that's how spring break got started.
I don't know.
And eventually people say things about you, like: "Well, it's amazing, he's 28, but he's still very alert.
His mind is so sharp, you would think you're talking to a 2-year-old".
What's the point?
When I like them, they don't like me.
When they like me, I don't like them.
Why can't I act with ones I like the way I do with ones I don't?
Well, you've only got another 50 years or so to go and it'll all be over.
Maybe I need someone who doesn't speak English.
Yeah, how about a mute?
A mute would be good.
Where you gonna meet a mute?
This is what my life has come to: Trying to meet a mute.
I don't know, Jerry, Something's missing.
There's a void, Jerry.
There's a void.
A deep, yawning chasm.
Well, there's gotta be more to life than this.
What gives you pleasure?
Listening to you.
I listen to this for 15 minutes, I'm on top of the world.
Your misery is my pleasure.
- Hey, boys.
- Hey, how you doing?
Good.
Okay.
Well, it's all set.
I start tomorrow.
- Start what?
- I signed up to do volunteer work with senior citizens.
- Really?
Yeah.
God.
I can't tell you how I feel.
I mean, I feel so good.
I really feel good.
The strange thing is, I mean, I haven't even met the woman yet.
- Volunteer work?
- What are you gonna do down there?
They say all it is is you go over to their apartment and you take them out for a walk and you get a cup of coffee and it's supposed to make them feel good.
That's what I do with him.
Wait.
When did you get this idea?
Last time I had lunch with you here.
You were going on and on and on about how you wanna meet somebody who didn't speak English.
What, do you break it in with her then you try it out on me?
- And anybody could do this?
- Yeah.
Really?
Helping people.
Of course.
Of course.
It makes perfect sense.
How could I not be doing this?
- I am gonna help somebody, damn it.
- What about you?
No, it's not for me.
Jerry, if anybody should be doing this, it's you.
What kind of a person are you?
I think I'm pretty much like you.
Only successful.
This is a wonderful thing.
They're so grateful to have someone to talk to.
And I can tell you that everyone who participates finds the experience extremely rewarding.
Well, I feel better already.
I mean, I'm feeling like a good person.
- Good luck.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
Hey, hey, what's your guy's name again?
Fields.
Sidney Fields.
Eighty-seven years old.
Eighty-seven.
- How about your guy?
- Ben Cantwell, 85.
You think we'll make it to that age?
We?
No.
- Hey.
- Hey.
So, what's up, diggety-dog?
George and I just signed up with the senior citizens volunteer agency.
Same thing Elaine's doing.
Oh, that's too bad.
Don't say I didn't try to warn you.
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, Jerry, I'm surprised at you.
- What?
- It's a con.
These agencies are usually a front for some money-laundering scheme.
Or they're bunco artists.
Bilking people out of their life savings.
Oh, yeah.
- Where do you get this?
- The alternative media, Jerry.
That's where you hear the truth.
Kramer?
Kramer?
Kramer!
Where are you?
Kramer!
Come on, I'm in here.
Come on.
- There you are.
- Yeah.
Hello, Newman.
Jerry.
George.
So did you ask him about the records?
- Well - What records?
Newman and I are going partners, selling used records.
You know Ron's Records down on Bleecker?
They pay big cash for used records.
So we thought if you had any of those big old-fashioned useless records just lying around, you know We'd take them off your hands.
Free.
Let me ask you something.
What do you do for a living, Newman?
I'm a United States postal worker.
Aren't those the guys that always go crazy and come back with a gun and shoot everybody?
Sometimes.
- Why is that?
- Because the mail never stops.
It just keeps coming and coming and coming.
Never a letup.
It's relentless.
Every day it piles up more and more and you gotta get it out but more keeps coming in!
Then the bar code reader breaks, and it's Publishers Clearing House day!
All right, all right, all right.
Just take the records.
They're in the bedroom.
Take them.
- Take anything you want.
- Yeah, yeah.
I'll give you 5 bucks.
- Five bucks?
- Five bucks?
- Do you know what those are worth?
- Yeah, I do.
Five dollars.
Those records are worth more than 5 dollars.
- He's gypping us.
- You're gypping us.
Well, what do you got?
You know, you got Don Ho Live In Honolulu.
You got Jerry Vale Sings Italian Love Songs.
And you got Sergio Mendes.
Now, come on!
Wait, wait, wait.
Sergio Mendes has a cult following.
Why, they follow him like a cult.
Can't walk down the street in South America.
Look, that's his problem, all right?
Now, you don't like it?
Too bad.
- I don't like it.
- I don't like it.
Then get out of my store, all right?
You bring me something decent, I'll give you some money.
- All right, we'll be back, Jack.
- All right.
- Come on.
- We'll be back Jack.
Hi.
I'm Jerry Seinfeld.
The agency sent me.
- Agency?
- Yeah.
Is this Sid Fields' residence?
- Sid Fields?
- What the hell is it?
- Mr. Fields?
- What?
Hi.
I'm Jerry Seinfeld.
The agency sent me.
The agency?
What agency?
The CIA?
- No, no, the senior - Who let you in here?
- The woman.
- Oh, her.
She steals from me.
Steals my money.
She says she doesn't speak English.
My ass, she doesn't speak English.
Plays that freaking voodoo music.
Tries to hypnotize me.
She thinks she's gonna turn me into a zombie and then rob me blind.
Well, I wasn't born yesterday.
I might drop dead today, but I sure as hell wasn't born yesterday.
Now, get the hell out of my house.
But, Mr. Fields, I'm here to spend some time with you.
Oh, really?
Are you the boyfriend?
I know she's got a boyfriend.
Are you gonna kill me?
I'm an old man, for crying out loud.
You gonna kill an old man, you coward?
No, Mr. Fields.
Look.
Really.
I'm Here's my ident I can't read that, you fool.
- Well, what's all this stuff?
- Trash.
Garbage.
You're throwing this out?
I believe that's what you do with garbage, you idiot.
Really?
You don't want any of this?
Well, if I wanted it, I wouldn't be throwing it away, would I, Einstein?
I have friends that would really love to have these.
Well, take it.
I sure as hell am not gonna give it to my family.
Well, do you wanna go out and go for a walk, get a cup of coffee?
With you?
I'd rather be dead.
Well, maybe I'll get going, then.
I just remembered I got an appointment to get my tonsils out.
Good.
Thank God.
Good riddance.
Oh, listen, before you go would you mind changing my diaper?
Oh, I feel great for 85.
You know, the average life span for an American male is, like, 72.
You're really kind of pushing the envelope there.
I'm not afraid to die, and I never think about it.
You don't?
Boy, I think about it a lot.
I think about it at my age.
Imagine how much I'll be thinking about it at your age.
All I'll do is keep thinking about it till it drives me insane.
I'm grateful for every moment I have.
Grateful?
How can you be grateful when you're so close to the end?
When you know that any second: It could all be over.
I mean, you're not stupid.
You can read the handwriting on the wall.
It's a matter of simple arithmetic, for God's sake.
I guess I just don't care.
What are you talking about?
How can you sit there and look me in the eye and tell me that you're not worried?
Don't you have any sense?
Don't you have a brain?
Are you so completely senile you don't even know what you're talking about anymore?
Wait a second.
Where are you going?
Life's too short to waste on you.
- Whoa, whoa, please.
- Get out of my way.
But, Mr. Cantwell, you owe me for the soup.
- Mrs. Oliver?
- Yes, my dear?
- What's the trouble?
Are you all right?
- Yeah.
Yeah Yes.
Yeah.
It's my goiter, isn't it?
Did you say goiter?
What goiter?
This football-shaped lump jutting out the side of my neck.
That goiter.
Hey.
What do you know?
Does it bother you?
Bother me?
Why would a little goiter like that bother me?
No.
Not a bit.
It's nothing.
It's nothing.
It's In fact, it's very distinctive.
You know?
I mean, you wanna know something?
I wish I had one.
Really.
Come on, Elaine, it's just a goiter.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
I can't look the woman in the face.
I mean, I keep thinking that goiter's gonna start talking to me.
You'd think that they'd mention that before they sent you over there.
"Oh, by the way, this woman almost has a second head".
But no, no.
I didn't get any goiter information.
They really should mention that in the breakdown.
Height.
Weight.
Goiter.
You know, you try to do some good.
You wanna be a good person, but this is too much to ask.
Well, I'd rather talk to a goiter with a nice disposition than the nut they sent me to.
Georgie, what happened with your guy?
I don't think it's gonna work out.
- What do you mean?
- He fired me.
He fired you?
How do you get fired from a volunteer job?
I don't know.
I was just talking to the man, and he walked out on me.
Well, I don't know about you two, but I'm quitting.
I hate my guy.
He's a mean, mean guy.
- I wish I could quit.
- So quit.
Yeah, I'm a great quitter.
It's one of the few things I do well.
I come from a long line of quitters.
My father was a quitter.
My grandfather was a quitter.
I was raised to give up.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Well, here's your albums.
- What happened?
- Five dollars.
- He offered us 5 dollars.
- What kind of stuff you listening to?
You embarrassed me at that store.
That guy thought we were a couple of total squares.
Oh, yeah, you and your Sergio Mendes.
Hey, that guy can't even go to the bathroom in South America.
You should have seen the albums this old guy I was visiting today was throwing away.
Sinatra, Duke Ellington, Al Jolson, Benny Goodman.
- Wait, he's throwing them out?
- I asked if my friends could have them.
- He said, "Yeah".
- The coot's sitting on a mountain of gold.
- Yeah.
You have to get them.
I'm not carrying them.
- But you're gonna come.
- Yeah.
I'm going there today.
In fact, you should see this housekeeper.
She's from Senegal.
Wild, wild stuff.
Senegal?
So you don't speak any English at all?
- English?
No.
- No.
Hey, what are those bums doing back there?
You said they could come and take the records.
It's like watching a couple of hyenas going through the garbage.
- You don't speak any English?
- No English.
I would like to dip my bald head in oil and rub it all over your body.
You don't understand.
It's a miracle.
You don't understand because you don't speak English.
So I just don't know if this arrangement Hey.
Hey.
I don't like what's going on around here.
- I want all of you bums out of here.
- Calm down - Don't tell me to calm down.
- Please - Get your hands off me.
- Cool it, pops.
- Why, you little - Wait, wait, Mr. Fields.
He's biting me!
My teeth.
My teeth!
Where's his teeth?
Where's his teeth?
I saw something fly over here.
Well, turn the light on.
That's the garbage disposal.
My teeth.
You idiots.
Well, we'll take you to your dentist.
Where's your dentist?
- Downtown.
- All right.
George, Kramer, look after Mr. Fields.
I'll go get the cab.
Bunch of morons.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Where's the old man?
I thought George was keeping an eye on him.
- Me?
I thought you were.
- Come on, we lost the old man.
Let's go.
Get out of the car.
Go.
We've gotta find him.
He can't have gotten far.
And we would take long automobile trips.
- Well, that sounds like a lot of fun.
- Yes, and just staring out the window you'd see a long view of rolling pastures and - Get you going, right there.
and very big Brahman cows and - Oh, cows?
Oh, that's - Yeah, that was when fascinating.
I began my affair with Mohandas.
- What?
- Mohandas.
Gandhi?
The passion.
The forbidden pleasure.
You had an affair with Gandhi?
He used to dip his bald head in oil and he'd rub it all over my body.
Here.
Look.
Oh, my God.
The Mahatma?
We're supposed to be looking for the old man.
Oh, we will.
We will.
Twenty bucks.
Twenty bucks?
Are you out of your mind?
- Take it or leave it.
- We got Al Jolson here.
Al Jolson!
Al Jolson.
What the hell do I care about Al Jolson?
I'd just as soon hear you sing "Mammy".
This guy is nothing but a piece of crap.
You are nothing but a piece of crap.
What did you call me?
- A piece of crap.
- A piece of crap.
- I find you extremely ugly.
- I find you extremely ugly.
- Do you?
- You emit a foul and unpleasant odor.
- You emit a foul and unpleasant odor.
- Oh, is that right?
- I loathe you.
- I loathe you.
That's it.
Get out of my store.
- Make us.
- Make us.
Make us.
Make us.
- I'll make you.
- Wait a minute.
Wait!
Wait!
Do you realize how irresponsible this is?
Our agency's sole purpose is to care for senior citizens.
And in one fell swoop you have single-handedly destroyed our reputation.
Yes, but - Yes?
- It's Tim Fields.
Mr. Fields' son.
All right, come on up.
Oh, great.
I don't know what happened.
We tried to take him to the dentist.
Why were you taking him to the dentist?
Well, his false teeth got mangled up in the garbage disposal.
What were his teeth doing in the garbage disposal?
- Well, after he bit my friend - Bit your friend?
What the hell is going on here?
How do you lose a human being?
- I am sorry.
- And who were these other people?
What were they doing in the apartment?
Well, I brought them up there to take his records.
Take his records?
Do you realize how valuable that record collection is?
- Hey!
- There you are.
Did you find him?
No.
We took the records over to Ron's, and he tried to screw us and then we got in a fight.
- A real melee.
Yeah, a real brouhaha.
- Then all the records broke.
- The records?
My father's records?
- Did anybody try and call him?
- Yeah, I called, but there's no answer.
Well, the line's busy now.
The line's busy.
He must be home.
We We couldn't find him.
What the hell's the point?
When you like them, they don't like you and when they like you, you don't like them.
Oh, you don't know what you want.
You should see a psychiatrist.
I got fixed up last week.
I never would get fixed up.
I go to pick her up, and she opens the door and she's got this huge goiter growing out of the side of her neck.
Looked like a football.
- What did you do?
- Well, we get to talking and as it turns out, the woman knew Gandhi.
We talked for hours.
Well, are you gonna see her again?
We were getting along real good and then she made some tea.
Put some milk in it without asking me.
Now, that's a turnoff.
You don't need that.
The thing about old people is everything about them gets smaller.
You know, their bodies get smaller.
They move into smaller places.
They sleep less time, they eat smaller meals.
Except the car.
The older they get, the bigger their car gets.
I've never understood that.
Old people have a way of backing out of the driveway.
Know what I mean?
They don't turn side to side.
They just go, "I'm old.
I've been waiting a long time.
I'm backing it out".
You know?
"I'm coming back.
Watch out.
I'm coming," you know.
And you've gotta watch out for them.
And then once they get out there they drive so slowly.
I would think the less time you have in life the faster you would wanna go.
I think old people should be allowed to drive their age.
If you're 80, do 80.
If you're 100, go 100.
They can't see where they're going anyway, let them have fun out there.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
I don't belong to a health club.
I have a limit on naked men I see in one day.
Zero.
That's it.
What is with the high level of security at health clubs, you know?
The picture IDs.
Security guards.
Signing in and out.
What is this, the Kremlin?
I mean, the people with a membership go twice a year.
Who's breaking in?
Is this a big problem, people stealing exercise?
And what if they catch the person?
What then?
They run.
It's aerobic.
Makes it even worse.
- Hi, Jerry.
- Oh, hi, Sidra.
I last about 10 minutes on the StairMaster.
Unless someone's stretching in front of me in a leotard, then I can go an hour.
- Really?
- That's why it's called the StairMaster.
You get up there and you stare.
Well, I'm done.
I think I'm gonna go take a sauna.
I'll see you Thursday night?
- Thursday night.
- Okay.
Good workout?
Tremendous workout.
- It's a pretty girl.
- Tremendous girl.
- She the one you went out with?
- Yeah.
I really like her.
You know, they're fake.
- What?
Don't say that.
- No.
They're fake.
- How do you know?
- I can tell.
You know how you always brag how you can spot a lesbian?
I'm not bragging.
I happen to have a very keen lesbian eye.
Hi, how you doing?
Oh, right.
Come on.
Don't you think they seem just a bit too perfect?
Yes, they do.
I never knew you were into breasts.
Thought you were a leg man.
Leg man?
Why would I be a leg man?
I don't need legs.
I have legs.
Have you seen her naked in the locker room?
- No.
- Then I can't accept your testimony.
Maybe if you'd seen her naked.
- I don't wanna see her naked.
- Well, I do.
Well, that's your problem.
Look, you made the allegation.
The least you could do is follow up.
Jerry, what am I gonna do?
Go in there and spy on her in the sauna?
Yes.
Go in there.
Do a little investigative journalism.
I need to know.
But a few more dates, you can find out for yourself.
Don't be so sure.
Look at George.
He's on his ninth date with Betsy.
Still hasn't got anywhere.
What's his problem?
Every time he makes a move something screws up.
Their last date they were on the couch but she was on his wrong side.
- Wrong side?
Yeah, she was on his right side.
He can't make a move with his left hand.
Can't go left.
- He can't go left?
- No.
I'm lefty.
Can't go right.
What about women?
They go left or right?
No, we just play defense.
Could I ask you a question?
Would you mind switching seats?
Actually, I'd really prefer to sit here.
I don't hear very well out of this ear.
I always try to sit to the right of people.
I'll shout.
Well, I really think I feel more comfortable here.
Come on, come on.
- Come on, really.
Come on.
- George, l - Now, come on.
- No, I really See, now is that so bad?
What?
- Oh, l - The machine will get it.
No, it's not on.
- They'll call back.
- George, what if it's an emergency?
In the whole world right now there's maybe three emergencies.
Why would you think on this planet that you're one of those three?
George, please.
Hello.
What?
Oh, my God.
All right, maybe four.
Boy, I'm really sweating.
Good sweat.
Beads of sweat.
Sweating bullets.
Look at her.
I don't need to see her naked to know those aren't real.
I mean, why'd she even tie the towel around her?
She's got a rack on her chest.
Oh, God.
Sidra's taking the towel off.
Doctor.
That's it.
I knew it.
I knew it.
They're definitely fake.
So when's the funeral?
Oh, well.
Aunt Clarice was so ill I guess it was really a blessing.
Yeah, I'll fly home as soon as I can.
Okay.
You too.
Get some sleep.
- You're sure?
- Positive.
This chick's playing with Confederate money.
Then that's it.
That's the end of that.
- What?
Just because that?
- Just because of that?
It's like finding out Mickey Mantle corked his bat.
You've dated women with nose jobs.
What's the difference?
You don't touch the nose.
You don't aspire to reach the nose.
You don't unhook anything to get to a nose and no man has ever tried to look up a woman's nostrils.
You've put a lot of thought into this, haven't you?
Well, I take it very seriously.
Sometimes when I think you're the shallowest man I've ever met you somehow manage to drain a little more out of the pool.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You know, I do kind of wonder what fake breasts feel like.
Well, I know what they feel like.
You?
How do you know?
Well, I lived in Los Angeles for three months.
- I thought you hated Los Angeles.
- No, I do.
Just miss the warm weather, you know?
Oh, man, I wish I could get away.
Real busy now, down at the office?
No.
You know who I saw at the health club?
Salman Rushdie.
- No.
- Yeah, right.
Salman Rushdie.
Well, I could see that.
You got five million Moslems after you.
You wanna stay in pretty good shape.
I know what the problem is.
I like her too much.
That's why I can't make a move.
- You put her on a pedestal.
- I put them on a dental chair.
He puts them on a dental chair.
I'm not her boyfriend.
I wanna be her boyfriend.
It's like a sauna in here.
- That's funny.
- You're a funny guy.
Never heard that before.
So you going to the funeral?
- You think I should?
- Are you kidding?
It's a golden opportunity to advance the relationship.
She's crying.
You put your arm around her and console her.
You're the consolation guy.
- I'm the consolation guy.
- Consolation guy is big.
Her aunt dying is the best thing for you.
It's like 10 dates in one shot.
This confers upon you instant boyfriend status.
The family's there.
You're taking care of things.
You're getting sandwiches.
You're the rock.
It's in Detroit, though.
It's an expensive flight.
Why don't you get a "death in the family" fare?
What?
Go to the airlines.
Tell them that you have a death in the family they give you - Really?
- In fact listen, I'll go with you.
We'll tell them there's a death in my family.
You buy the ticket.
I'll split it.
Then I'll get the bonus miles and you'll get to Detroit for a quarter of the price.
Boy, I'm getting a good sweat here.
Great sweat.
Good beads.
Nice beads.
Oh, look who's here.
Silicon Valley.
Oh, so anyway.
We go out on one date, and he asks me out for a second and then out of nowhere he calls me, cancels the date and says he doesn't wanna see me again.
Sorry.
I couldn't help overhearing.
- Oh, that's okay.
- Did he give you a reason?
Yeah.
He's going back to his old girlfriend.
Really?
Said she's mentally ill.
He's one of those guys who is obsessed with neatness and order.
Everything has gotta be just so.
He would have made a great Nazi.
Hey, does he ever talk about Superman?
- Yes.
How did you know?
- I know the type.
- Oh, so you can relate?
- Oh, yeah.
You know, I've seen you around the club.
My name's Sidra.
This is Marcy.
- Oh, hi.
I'm Elaine.
- Hi.
Anyway, I stood up to shake her hand and suddenly I lost my balance and I fell right into her.
- You fell on her?
I touched them.
You what?
I touched them.
You touched them?
I needed them to help me break my fall.
If it hadn't been for them, I could have really injured myself.
Anyway they're real.
Excuse me.
I think they might be real.
Oh, what do you know?
You have no breast-touching experience.
- I've touched mine.
- So have I. Oh, right, I forgot.
Anyway, touching two breasts doesn't make you an expert.
All right.
Anyway, I think they're real, and if they are, they are spectacular.
What are you doing to me?
You see my friend here, his aunt passed away last Oh, I'm very sorry.
I saw her last week.
She looked healthy and peaceful but she knew.
You poor thing.
You don't think you could buy the ticket yourself?
Oh, no, okay.
- I couldn't - No, please.
There, there.
You sit.
I'll purchase the ticket for you.
You're a good friend.
I understand you offer a Yes.
You have to pay the full fare now then return to one of our counters with a copy of the death certificate, and we'll refund half your fare.
The death certificate?
Yes, we do need documentation or people could take advantage.
What kind of a sick person would do a thing like that?
I know but it happens.
You want my friend to ask his uncle, a man who lost his wife of 44 years for a death certificate to save a few bucks on a flight?
That would be $387 round trip.
- You'll need my frequent flyer number.
- Yes.
I don't know.
One minute they're fake the next they're real.
I don't know what to believe.
Hey, of the two of us, I'm the only one who's touched them.
Well, you were grabbing onto them to save your life.
If you were drowning and I threw you a life preserver you think you could tell me if it was an inflatable?
I wouldn't have said anything if I'd known you'd stop seeing her.
I don't mind a phony personality but I gotta draw the line somewhere.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- George off to Detroit?
- Yep.
And in two days l'm off to Puerto Rico.
Hey, Kramer, by the way I saw that guy at the health club.
That is not Salman Rushdie.
Wrong.
- There's Sidra.
- There's Salman.
- Where?
- Talking to that woman.
- To Sidra?
- lf that's Sidra, she's talking to Salman.
- I don't think that's Salman.
- I don't think they're real.
- lf that's Rushdie, they're real.
- lf they're real, that's Rushdie.
- I gotta know.
I'm talking to Sidra.
- I gotta know.
I'm talking to Salman.
Like a sauna in here, huh?
Feel like I'm back at the desert.
- You've lived in the desert?
- Oh, yeah.
I've I spent a little time in the Mideast.
You ever been to the Mideast?
- Yes, I've been there.
- Look, my name's Kramer.
- Sal Bass.
- Yeah.
- Pleased to meet you, Kramer.
- Yeah.
So what kind of work do you do?
I'm a writer.
- Have you met my boyfriend, George?
- No.
George, this is Aunt May and Father Jessup.
Oh, and that's my brother, Timmy.
This is my boyfriend, George.
Oh, George, how nice of you to come all this way.
Well, I'm the boyfriend.
Otherwise, what's the point of being the boyfriend.
This is where you have to be when you're the boyfriend.
Betsy, dear, have you had anything to eat?
- I'm not very hungry.
- They have some very nice snacks.
I'm about to get myself a snack.
Oh, no.
You sit right here.
I will get you a nice snack.
This is my third wake this month.
Never gets any easier.
Well, losing a loved one is I mean, forget about it.
You You seem to be of great comfort to Betsy.
We're very appreciative.
Comfort "schmomfort".
Listen, Father, can I ask you a question?
In a terrible time like this who would I get the death certificate from?
- Oh, Jerry.
- Oh, how can you be so sure?
Jerry, are you blind?
He's a writer.
He said his name was Sal Bass.
Bass, Jerry.
Instead of salmon, he went with bass.
He just substituted one fish for another.
Look, you idiot, first of all, it's "Salman," not "salmon".
Jerry, Jerry, you're missing the big picture.
All right.
Maybe it is, but listen, I gotta get ready Sidra's coming over so if you don't mind - What, did you ask her?
- I'm gonna find out tonight.
Yes.
Why do you need a death certificate?
Well, Dr. Allenwood I was hoping to compile an admittedly rudimentary scrapbook of her life.
Something that Betsy could have and hold on to.
Well, I suppose I could make a copy of it.
Oh, that would be wonderful.
- Well, it's nice meeting you, George.
- Likewise.
What are you doing?
- What?
- Did?
Did you just double dip that chip?
- Excuse me?
- You double dipped the chip.
Double dipped?
What are you talking about?
You dipped the chip.
You took a bite and you dipped again.
- So?
- It's like putting your whole mouth right in the dip.
From now on, when you take a chip just take one dip and end it.
Well, I'm sorry, Timmy but I don't dip that way.
- Oh, you don't, huh?
- No.
You dip the way you wanna dip l'll dip the way I wanna dip.
- Give me the chip.
- Hey, hey, hey!
Give me the chip.
I don't know what I'm doing here.
I must be crazy.
- Hey, you mind switching seats?
- Why?
I don't know.
I like sitting to the left of people.
Makes me feel like I'm driving.
Okay.
- How you doing?
- Good.
- How you doing?
- Good.
Feel good.
You know that Jayne Mansfield had some big breasts.
Really big Huge.
Just coming out the top of her dress.
They were choking her.
- I hear that's how she died.
- Yeah.
Have you noticed that women today are?
You know, they seem bigger.
- A lot of women are having them done.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- How do you like that?
A lot of people ask me if I've had mine done.
You know people.
Gets a little tiring.
It's none of their business.
Oh, the nerve.
You know some people have asked me if you've done that.
And what do you tell them?
Whatever you want me to tell them.
Well, I think you'll find out soon enough.
- Aren't you gonna get that?
- No.
- Well, what if it's an emergency?
- Oh, there's no emergency.
Jerry.
Come on.
It's an emergency.
Excuse me.
All right.
What is it?
You're interrupting.
I'm packing for Puerto Rico.
I need to borrow your bathing suit.
This is an emergency?
You need a bathing suit?
Well, I like yours.
I don't know, my bathing suit?
That's a little familiar.
I don't want your boys down there.
What's the matter with my boys?
Your boys should stay in their neighborhood.
- All right, come on.
- All right.
It's in the top drawer.
- Hurry up.
- Hey.
- Hi, Jer.
- Hi, Elaine.
- Oh, hi, Sidra.
- Hi.
Elaine?
- What are you doing here?
- Looking for Kramer.
- What's going on?
- She was just showing me pictures of places in Puerto Rico.
- When you two went down there.
- Oh, yeah.
All right.
- Well, just - You know, these - Yeah, yeah.
- All right.
So where were we?
- I was just leaving.
- Right.
You were leaving.
I can't believe you sent a woman into the sauna to do that?
That was an accident.
I think you're both mentally ill.
And by the way, they're real and they're spectacular.
Stop it, George.
Get out.
Get out!
I never wanna see you again.
- Go back to New York.
- Get out.
All right, sir.
Now all I need is a death certificate and you'll be on your way.
Well, you see what happened was the doctor, the very same doctor that was attending my late aunt suffered an untimely stroke and lost the use of his right hand so obviously I was unable to get the death certificate.
However, I do have this.
What's this?
- A picture of me next to the coffin.
- Nice try.
- Not even close, huh?
No.
The cosmetic surgery procedures that are available to people today Liposuction.
Are you familiar with this?
This is a fat-sucking machine.
Now, you know, somewhere, somebody is working on a way that this thing could go into a restaurant.
And you could just order it off the menu.
Give me the cheesecake, crank me up to nine and put a scoop of ice cream on the side.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
A friend's getting married.
The bachelor party and bridal shower are the same day, so it's conceivable that while she's getting lingerie he'll be at a nude bar watching a dancer in the same outfit.
That is possible.
But the difference between single and married is the form of government.
You see, when you're single you're the dictator of your own life.
I have complete power.
When I give the order to fall asleep on the sofa with the TV on no one can overrule me.
When you're married you are part of a vast decision-making body.
Before anything's done, there are meetings.
Committees have to study the situation.
And this is if the marriage works.
That's what so painful about divorce: You've been impeached.
You weren't even the president.
Hey, is it my imagination, or do really good-looking women walk a lot faster than everybody else?
We don't walk that fast.
- No, seriously.
- Seriously, we don't.
The better-looking they are, the faster they go.
I see them on the street zooming around.
They're a blur.
It's like they got a motor on their ass.
Hey, Jerry, come on, let's go.
We're gonna miss the previews.
What's the big hurry?
How we getting to Scott Drake's party on Saturday night?
Oh, Drake's party.
I forgot to buy a present.
What, I gotta buy a present now?
Of course you do.
It's an engagement party.
It never ends, this present stuff.
Engagement present.
Then they get married.
You gotta get them something.
Then a baby.
Another present.
Then the baby starts getting their presents.
I don't even like Drake.
- Don't like the Drake?
- Hate the Drake.
- I love the Drake.
- How could you not like the Drake?
- Who's the Drake?
- Who's the Drake?
The Drake is good.
So, what are you gonna get him?
You know, I haven't even met the fiancée.
Oh, whatever!
Elaine, look.
I drew this triangle freehand.
It's a doodle.
It's perfect.
So what?
That's easy.
Easy?
Hi.
Hey, have you gotten a present yet for the Drake?
- No, no, not yet.
- You like the Drake?
I love the Drake.
I'm looking forward to meeting the "Drakette".
I'm lukewarm about the Drakette.
Boy, that's a nice triangle.
It's isosceles.
Isosceles.
You know, I love the name "Isosceles".
If I had a kid, I would name him Isosceles.
Isosceles Kramer.
Hey, you know what, maybe we should all chip in for the gift.
- The chip-in.
- Hey, pretty good idea?
- Yeah.
- The chip-in.
Definitely.
Let's go to that mall in Lynbrook before the party.
- We'll take your car.
It's got room.
- No, no.
My car's not running.
What about your father's car?
No.
Out of the question.
I was over there today.
He's got the good spot in front of the good building.
I know he's not gonna want to move.
- Are you serious?
- You don't know what it means to him.
Once he gets it, he doesn't go out for weeks.
How about this: You put your car in the good spot.
That'll hold the good spot, and we can get the good car.
- Good thinking.
- Good to meet you.
- So, what are we gonna get him?
- Anything we want.
We're chipping in.
I like this area.
I could live out here.
Yeah, we ought to all get a house and live together out here.
That's a good idea.
Tell you what, chuckles l'll give you permission to sublet my room right now.
Look at this.
There's no spaces here.
- Excuse me.
You getting out?
- No.
Why don't you take the handicapped spot?
- You think?
- No, no.
We'll find a space.
- There's spaces in the other lot.
- I don't wanna walk that far.
What if a handicapped person needs it?
- No, come on, they don't drive.
- Yes, they do.
Have you ever seen a handicapped person pull into a space and park?
The space is there, they must drive.
No, they don't.
If they could drive, they wouldn't be handicapped.
So if you can drive, you're not handicapped?
We're not gonna be long.
We gotta get to the party.
I got news for you: Handicapped people don't even want to park there.
They want to be treated just like everybody else.
That's why those spaces are always empty.
He's right.
It's the same thing with the feminists.
They want everything to be equal.
Everything.
But when the check comes, where are they?
What does that mean?
Yeah.
- All right, I'm pulling in.
- Go ahead, George.
- George!
- Come on.
It's five minutes.
Don't forget where the car is parked.
- Don't worry.
- We'll remember.
Do you believe the deal we got on this?
- A big-screen TV at that price?
- What a sale, huh?
And how about that store delivering it tonight.
We're gonna be swimming in thank-yous.
Why did I get the veggieburger?
You got a veggieburger, so I got one.
It's like eating a loaf of crumbs.
No one's gonna have a better gift than this big-screen TV.
Good for them.
Love the Drake.
Got to love the Drake.
Hey, what's going on over here?
There must have been an accident.
What's going on?
Some jerk parked in the handicapped spot so this woman in a wheelchair had to wheel up this incline.
Halfway up, her batteries gave out, and she rolled backwards into the wall.
Had to take her to Saint Elizabeth's.
- Is she okay?
- I don't know.
We're just waiting for the owner of this car to show up.
He may not get out alive.
Taking up a handicapped spot.
He's gonna pay.
Sons of bitches.
Well, good luck finding them.
Him.
Whatever.
I'd like to get my hands on him myself, but I gotta take off.
We're gonna get you, you coward!
- They'll kill us.
- You happy?
Are you happy now?
- How long you think they'll be here?
- Don't know.
What about the party, the Drake?
- Oh, screw the Drake!
- I love the Drake.
Let's just take a bus back into the city.
I can't leave the car here.
- Why not?
- It's my father's car.
- Let's smash it!
- Yeah!
Hey, hey!
Leave the car alone!
All right, let's get out of here.
We gotta figure something out.
What are we gonna do?
How will we get out?
Even if we go to the car and they're not there how do we know they're not hiding?
They have to give up some time.
They can't stay out there all night.
What are we, John Dillinger?
How did this get to be the crime of the century?
It's not like we stuck a broomstick in her spokes and she went flying.
What I don't get is, just because the batteries went dead you'd think she'd be able to roll it up the hill with her hands.
You'd think.
Batteries have gone dead before.
Aren't they prepared?
You know, most of them don't even have batteries.
Must have been a rich, spoiled handicapped person who didn't want to do any work.
Just wanted to sit in her wheelchair and take it easy.
- Yeah.
- Well, I'm sorry.
Our big-screen TV is probably arriving just about now.
How we getting out?
We need a plan.
I got it.
We'll give the keys to Elaine.
- Me?
- Yeah.
You're a woman.
Men won't hit a woman.
Oh, they won't?
Not if they don't know you.
I'm not going for this.
Kramer should go.
You know, it was all his idea.
No chance in hell.
What if we created some sort of diversion?
What if we went over and started screaming: "There's the guy that took the handicapped spot".
When they run the other direction, we'll jump in the car.
- That's good.
- Let's give it a try.
If that doesn't work, we'll give them Kramer.
Oh, my God.
You know, a lot of these scratches will buff right out.
Eight years I had that car, not a scratch on it.
Eight years.
- Two crack.
- Three dot.
Beautiful Mercury.
I special ordered that bench seat.
Dad, this other car cut us off.
They had swastikas all over it.
They were hurling racial epithets at us.
- I could have been killed.
- I told you not to give it to him.
- Three crack.
- Four bam.
You know, my insurance doesn't even cover this.
The whole thing is a total loss.
The important thing is he didn't get hurt.
No, it isn't.
So, what are you doing now, Georgie?
- North.
- I'm writing a pilot for NBC.
- Where the hell's my paper?
- You're writing a pilot?
With his friend Jerry Seinfeld, the comedian.
So, what's it about?
Well, Jerry's car gets hit and the other driver doesn't have any insurance so the judge sentences him to be Jerry's butler.
- It's the same situation.
- Exactly.
Frank, maybe you ought to make him your butler.
Flower.
Every time you're with that Kramer something happens.
- He's a real troublemaker.
- He didn't have anything to do with it.
He's all together crazy, that one.
And Jerry I used to think was nice.
I don't know what happened to him.
Nine bam.
- One dot.
- Two crack.
- Three bam.
- Mahjongg.
So it was a good party, huh?
You're welcome.
You're welcome.
They loved the TV.
Loved it.
Yeah.
Wait.
I'll ask her.
That's a great idea.
Drake wants to know if we'll come out to Mineola since we missed the party.
- Get something to eat.
- Sure.
Sure.
Okay.
Don't worry, I'm taking my car.
Okay.
All right, we'll see you later.
Bye.
The Drake is great.
He's so nice.
Man, I'm really happy for them.
Yeah.
Well, I don't know if I'm happy for them.
I'm glad they're happy, but frankly it doesn't do anything for me.
- Yes?
- It's me.
Come on up.
Hey.
I just came from Saint Elizabeth's.
Saint Elizabeth's Hospital?
Why?
Well, the handicapped woman, I went to see her.
- You went to see her?
- Yeah.
Wow, what happened?
I'm in love.
- What?
- Yeah.
She is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen.
I love her, Jerry.
I mean, I really love her.
I'm gonna ask her to marry me.
She's got everything I've always wanted in another human being.
Except for the walking.
What's the difference.
You don't go out that much.
- I'm glad you're here.
- Why?
We gotta go out, we gotta buy a wheelchair.
A wheelchair?
What for?
I went to the hospital today.
I saw the woman.
The wheelchair is totaled.
We gotta get her another one.
Doesn't she have collision?
George, I'm in love with her.
Look, my father works for the United Volunteers.
- Maybe he can get her one.
- No.
She needs it now.
What about these two?
Aren't they gonna chip in?
Hey, we told you not to park there.
Can't we just fix the old one?
All right, all right.
Fine, George, don't chip in.
But some day we'll be driving along we're gonna look out the window, see her crawling along Fifth Avenue.
- Is that what you want?
- All right!
All right!
We'll buy a wheelchair.
Wheelchairs.
Engagement presents.
It never ends!
This is our best model, the Cougar 9000.
It's the Rolls-Royce of wheelchairs.
This is like you're almost glad to be handicapped.
So, now, what's this got?
It's got inductive joystick, dynamic braking, flip-up arms.
It's fully loaded.
I put Stephen Hawking in one of these two months ago, he's loving it.
It's rated number one by Hospital Supply and Prosthetic Magazine.
- How much?
- Sixty-two hundred.
Do you have something a little more less expensive?
- Hi!
How you doing?
- Hey, Drake.
- Hi, Drake!
- Hi, Allison.
There's the TV.
Elaine, look at this.
Oh, my God, this is fantastic.
So tell me, were you guys just blown away or what?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, it's fantastic.
I am gonna make good use of this.
I'm watching every Super Bowl here.
Every big fight.
Oh, man, there is nothing like a really big TV, huh?
So, where are we eating?
- Well, actually, Jerry - I'm really hungry.
We just broke up.
- When did this happen?
- About 20 minutes ago.
Hey, I am really sorry about this, guys.
- Hell of a picture on this thing.
- Crystal clear.
They know how to make them.
Drake?
Are there any good Italian restaurants around here?
Gagliano's.
That's pretty good.
- Well, we should - Get moving.
Yeah.
Hey, Drake, whatever happens, I'm sure it'll be for the best.
Yeah.
Take it easy.
Bye-bye, Allison.
The remote.
Okay, I'm just gonna put it on top of the television Oh, God!
This one's about 8 years old.
Not a scratch on it.
It was owned by some lady who only used it to go to the kitchen to feed her cats.
- But this will get you around?
- Oh, sure.
It just doesn't have any of the frills of the Cougar.
- Like what?
- For example, your tremor-damping.
- Now, what's that?
- It helps to control the direction regardless of the operator's tremors or "spasticity".
- Well, is it all right if I try it?
- Hop in.
Oh, yeah.
I tell you when I see someone enjoying themselves like that it reminds me of why I got into this business in the first place.
How much?
How about $240?
- We'll take it.
- We'll take it.
- Drake gave her the TV?
- Gave her all the gifts.
He felt guilty.
Well, she can't keep it.
It's not fair.
That's our TV.
I know it is!
Boy, I'm really starting to dislike the Drake.
Hate the Drake!
Maybe the whole thing was a scam.
Anybody can just get engaged, get presents, and keep them.
Maybe they're on the way to Chicago to do the whole thing all over again.
They don't know anybody in Chicago.
Don't worry, they'll make friends fast with that nice TV.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Guess what?
The Drake broke up.
The Drake broke up!
That's fantastic!
We'll get the TV back.
Help defray some of the cost of the wheelchair.
- I don't know about defraying.
- Why?
We're not getting that TV.
What?
The engagement's off.
We get the TV back.
That's business.
The Drakette took it.
She can't take it.
It's not hers.
It's theirs.
Once there's no theirs, there's no hers.
It should be ours.
Well, she has it.
I told you the Drake was bad.
I hate the Drake!
Maybe we should call her.
- Oh, come on.
Who's gonna call?
- You are.
What?
Why is it me who always has to do these things?
Because that's your thing.
Calling people I hardly know and demanding they return expensive gifts?
That's my thing?
Yeah, that's your thing.
All right.
Give me the phone.
That's my thing.
You know, I'm thinking about getting a yo-yo.
- Really?
- Yeah.
I could see that.
- Hello?
- Allison.
Hi, this is Elaine.
I gave all the gifts to charity.
Oh, okay.
Well, thanks a lot.
Sorry again about you and the Drake.
- I hate the Drake.
- Everybody does.
Bye-bye.
- She gave it to charity.
- Charity?
That's appalling.
How could anybody be so selfish and inconsiderate.
Hey.
Well, I gave her the wheelchair.
You should have seen the look on her face.
Then she told me the old wheelchair wasn't any good anyway.
So you see, George, the whole incident was a God blessing.
Yeah.
- You mean a blessing in disguise?
- Yeah.
I would also like to take this time to personally thank our gracious host, Frank Costanza who earned the Silver Circle Award and is our unanimous choice for the United Volunteer representative of the month.
Due to his tireless effort, he has personally raised over $22,000.
And that's a lot of wheelchairs.
On behalf of the United Volunteers of New York, we thank you.
Thank you very much.
Mr. Costanza?
- Yes?
- You're under arrest.
Under arrest?
What for?
Reckless endangerment of public safety in violation of traffic code 342-A.
- What's that?
- Parking in a handicap spot.
Let's go.
George!
George!
Your father got arrested.
For what?
Parking in a handicapped spot.
Right in the middle of his United Volunteer's meeting.
When he got back, he chased after me with a baseball bat.
Holy Between the car being totaled, the towing charge and the fine there's no way I could ever pay him back.
So, what are you gonna do?
I agreed to become his butler.
What?
- What's the matter?
- It's over.
- What's over?
- Me and Lola.
- Who we bought the wheelchair for?
- She dumped me.
- She dumped you?
- She dumped me.
She rolled right over me.
Said I was a hipster doofus.
Am I a hipster doofus?
- No.
- No.
Said I'm not good-looking enough.
Not good-looking.
Jerry, look at me.
Look at my face.
Am I beautiful?
George, am I beautiful?
- You're very attractive.
- Yeah.
She says she doesn't want to see me again.
Told me to drop dead!
- Drop dead.
- Boy, even I never heard that one.
She's pretty rough.
Well, we just blew $240 on a wheelchair.
- $240 bucks?
- Well, it was slightly used.
Used?
I don't think you did such a good job on these.
- What?
- Supposed to see your face there.
Do you see your face in there?
Yeah.
Oh, really?
How about that.
Went right down a hill?
Okay.
All right.
Bye.
George, forget about the shoes.
I want you to do something for me.
This handicapped woman had an accident.
Somebody gave her a used wheelchair with defective brakes.
Sons of bitches!
Pick up this big-screen TV and deliver it to her.
- Big-screen TV.
- You think you can handle it?
- Yes?
- Hi, we're from the United Volunteers.
We've come to pick up the TV.
Great, it's right over there.
It's a big one.
- Who's got the receipt?
- I do.
- Will they give us cash?
- That's their policy.
I hate this mall.
There are never any spaces here.
Why don't you park in front of the hydrant?
- What if there's a fire?
- Now what are the chances of that?
The handicapped parking spot is the mirage of the parking desert.
Do you know that feeling?
You see it there in the distance.
You can't believe your eyes.
It's too good to be true.
It's a big wide spot by the entrance.
Somehow everybody missed it.
What is the handicapped parking situation at the Special Olympics?
They must have to just stack, like, a hundred cars into those two spots.
How else are they gonna do it?
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
When you ask for the doggy bag in a restaurant there's a sense of failure.
People always whisper it to the waiter, "Excuse me l'm sorry, you're gonna have to give me the doggy bag.
I couldn't make it".
It is embarrassing because a doggy bag means either you were at a restaurant when you're not hungry or you've chosen the stupidest way to get dog food that there is.
How about the doggy bag on a date?
That's a good move for a guy, huh?
Let me tell you, if you're a guy and you ask for the doggy bag on a date you might as well have them just wrap up your genitals too.
You're not gonna be needing those for a while either.
- Is that bothering you?
- No.
Not at all.
It's the BMW.
Oh, could you please hurry?
"Please hurry".
Look at you.
Look what you've become.
What?
What have I become?
I haven't become anything.
Oh, Carl can't wait a few more minutes?
- I don't want to keep him waiting.
- He'll like you more.
- That's impossible.
Stan, why do you have to pick your teeth at the table?
- Leave me alone.
- It's disgusting.
Yeah, I'm gonna get married real soon.
- So where am I dropping you?
- His place.
Guy's got quite a racket.
I take you to dinner then drop you at his apartment.
And he gets the rest of my chicken.
So is tonight the night?
You never know.
Baby doll.
Thank you, brother.
What, do you smell something?
Do I smell something?
What am I, hard of smelling?
- Of course I smell something.
- What is it?
I think its BO.
What?
It's BO.
The valet must've had BO.
It can't be.
Nobody has BO like this.
Jerry, its BO.
But the whole car smells.
- So?
- So when somebody has BO the O usually stays with the B. Once the B leaves, the O goes with it.
Oh, my God.
- I can't believe you ski.
- I'm a great skier.
Yeah, what else?
Let's see.
I ski, I fish I pillage, I plunder.
- You pillage and plunder?
- When I travel.
See, finally, finally I get to meet a man who pillages and plunders.
I'm so lucky.
- It should only take a second.
- Yeah, I'm gonna poke around.
Hey, what do you know?
Look at that.
A lesbian sighting.
My lucky day.
They're so fascinating.
Why is that?
Because they don't want us.
You gotta respect that.
Oh, my God.
It's Susan!
But what do I do?
George?
- Susan.
Hi.
- Hi.
Oh, boy.
What are you doing here?
- Renting a video.
- Right.
What do you got there?
Oh, some some stupid movie.
This is Mona.
Hi.
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Yes.
Well Well, I'll let you two catch up.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Yes.
I just haven't seen you in a long time.
And you didn't expect me to be holding hands with a woman.
Oh, please.
Me?
Come on, that's great.
Are you kidding?
I think that's fantastic.
I've always encouraged experimentation.
I'm the first guy in the pool.
Who do you think you're talking to?
- I know who I'm talking to.
- Of course you do.
It's just, you know, I never knew that - I like women?
- There you go.
So how long has this been going on?
Since you and I broke up.
So after me, you went that way?
Yeah.
I think that's fantastic.
Good for you.
Nice.
That's very nice.
- So, what do you got there?
- I don't - Rochelle, Rochelle.
- Yeah.
It's a foreign movie.
A film is what it is, actually.
- A lot of nudity in that, huh?
- No, no, just a tiny bit.
It's not even frontal nudity.
It's "sidal" nudity.
Next.
- That's me.
- Good seeing you, George.
Yes, good to see you too.
And good luck with With the whole thing there.
What are you returning?
Rochelle, Rochelle.
Oh, Rochelle, Rochelle.
A young girl's strange erotic journey from Milan to Minsk?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
That'll be $3.49.
Three forty-nine?
It says $ 1.49.
You didn't rewind it.
There's a $2 charge for not rewinding.
But there's no signs here.
- This is an outrage.
- Don't give him any money for that.
It'll cost you less to keep it another day, rewind it and bring it back tomorrow.
Don't give him the satisfaction.
I'm not giving you the satisfaction.
I'm gonna watch it again.
How could that hurt?
So this morning I go down to the garage to check the car out.
I figure by this time, the odor molecules have had at least 12 hours to "de-smellify".
- Right.
I open the car door like a punch in the face the stench hits me.
It's almost as if it had gained strength throughout the night.
You know, I can think of at least six known offensive odors that I would rather smell than what's living in your car.
- What about skunk?
- I don't mind skunk.
- Horse manure?
- I love horse manure.
I've never seen anything like this in my life.
In fact, I went to the car wash they want $250 to detail it and get the smell out.
I'm not paying for that.
That's not my responsibility.
I'm driving to that restaurant, and demand they pay for it.
Absolutely.
Listen, let me ask you something.
When you're with a guy and he tells you he has to get up early what does that mean?
- It means he's lying.
- Why, is that what he told you?
- Yeah.
Last night.
Oh, come on.
Men have to get up early sometime.
No.
Never.
Jerry, I'm sure I've seen men on the street early in the morning.
Well, sometimes we do have to get up early but a man will always trade sleep for sex.
Is it possible I'm not as attractive as I think I am?
Anything's possible.
Yeah.
- What's the matter with you?
- Steinbrenner!
- He's ruining my life.
- Oh, yes.
- Steinbrenner.
- I can't take another season with him.
He just traded away their best prospects just like he did with Buhner, McGee, Drabeck, McGriff.
I know the list.
What's that smell?
What?
What smell?
You stink.
- What do you mean, I stink?
- You stink.
- Why don't you take a shower.
- I showered.
Oh, wait a second.
Since I showered, I've been in the car.
- So?
- Don't you see what's happening?
It's attached itself to me.
It's alive.
If it's attached itself to you Oh, my God.
That's why Carl said he had to get up early, because I stink.
Jerry, he thinks I have BO.
Me.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- It's George.
- I'm coming right down.
- All right, what happened?
- What happened?
My car stinks is what happened.
And it's destroying the lives of everyone in its path.
- This is BO?
- Yes.
- This is unbelievable BO.
- I know.
At the car wash, the guy told me in 38 years in the business he's never smelled anything like it.
So let me ask you, do you think I could've done this?
No, no.
It's the valet guy.
No, no.
I mean, driven Susan to lesbianism.
Oh, no.
That's ridiculous.
What if her experience with me drove her to it.
Suicide, maybe.
Not lesbianism.
The woman she was "lesbianing" with Susan told me she's never been with a guy.
Oh, this isn't even BO.
This is beyond BO.
It's BBO.
There should be a BO squad that patrols the city to sniff them out, strip them down and wash them with a soapy brush.
The funny thing is, somehow I find her more appealing now.
Like, if I knew she was a lesbian when we went out I never would've broken up with her.
Let me see if I understand this.
On second thought Oh, my God, there he is.
That's the guy.
No, thank you.
Go back.
No, go back.
No, back, back.
Go back.
I got it.
I'll park it.
I'll park it.
Go back.
You go back.
Sorry.
Thank you.
Thank you, no.
What do you mean "stunk up"?
I mean the car stinks.
George, does the car stink?
- Stinks.
- Stinks.
Well, perhaps you're the one who has the odor.
I've never smelled in my life, buddy.
- Really?
Well, I can smell you now.
- That's from the car.
Maybe you stunk up the car, rather than the car stinking up you.
Oh, it's the chicken and the egg.
Thank you very much.
Well then, go out and smell the car.
See which smells worse.
I don't have time to smell cars.
Forget about smelling the car.
Smell the valet.
Go to the source.
- You gotta smell the car.
- I'm a busy man.
Come on.
One whiff.
All right.
One whiff.
All right.
I give up.
I admit it, it stinks.
Now could you let me out?
- Yeah, you'll pay for the cleaning?
- Yes, $50.
I'll give you $50.
- Fifty dollars, that's not gonna cover it.
- Whatever you want.
- I'll give you whatever you want!
- I want half, 125.
Yes!
Yes, 125 is good.
Now could you please open the door!
- All right.
- Let me out of here!
- Oh, my God.
- What?
The video.
Someone stole the video right out of the car.
- Someone stole Rochelle, Rochelle?
- Well, you left the window open.
We had to air out the car.
- You should pay for it.
- I'm not paying for that.
They already got my $ 7.
Erotic journey from Milan to Minsk.
- The valet had such bad BO?
- Oh, man, just rampant, mutant BO.
The O went from the valet's B to the car to me.
It clings to everything.
Jerry thinks it's an entity.
But I showered, and I shampooed.
So - That's a relief.
- Yeah.
- What?
- It's still there.
No, no, it can't be.
I shampooed.
I rinsed.
- I repeated.
- It's still there.
I smelled it.
I don't smell anything.
Take another smell.
- No.
No.
- No, here, just Please!
Which movie was that again?
Rochelle, Rochelle.
George.
Hey.
Thanks for meeting me here.
- Yeah, I don't have much time.
- Yeah, listen, I gotta ask you I was a little concerned that perhaps I was responsible in some way for your metamorphosis.
That'll be $98.
What $98?
That's what I said, $98.
How could that piece of crap cost $98?
- George, I really have - Do you believe this?
Ninety-eight dollars!
Do you have any cash?
I guess.
I need, like, 35.
Thanks.
So was it me?
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
Is that what you wanted to talk to me about?
- Here.
- Oh, thanks.
- Thanks a lot.
I'll pay you back.
- Yeah, sure.
- I gotta go.
- Listen.
Let me ask you something: If you and Mona were ever to dance how do you decide who leads?
I mean, do you take turns?
Do you discuss it beforehand?
How does that work?
You're an idiot.
Why?
That's a legitimate sociological question.
- I'll see you.
- But Oh, and George, by the way you stink.
You need a bath.
It's not me!
It's the car!
I didn't think I'd come.
I knew you would.
- Oh, Mona.
- Oh, Kramer.
You can give it the executive treatment.
That includes complete deionization of the entire vehicle.
Where we spray everything with Ozium-D, let it deionize vacuum the spray out with a deionizing machine.
Hit it with high-pressure compressed air and wet-dry vac it to extract the remaining liquids.
And we top it off with one of our seven air fresheners.
In your case, I would recommend the jasmine or the potpourri.
Let's do it.
The first thing that we're gonna do is flush the follicles with the five essential oils.
Then we put you under a vapor machine, and then a heated cap.
Then we shampoo and shampoo and condition and condition.
Then we saturate the hair in diluted vinegar.
Two parts vinegar, 10 parts water.
Now, if that doesn't work we have one last resort.
Tomato sauce.
Tomato sauce?
Thanks a lot.
Wait a minute.
It still smells.
It still smells!
It still smells.
It still smells.
- How could it still smell after all that?
- I don't know.
- What are you gonna do?
- I'll tell you what, I'm selling that car.
- You're selling the car?
- You don't understand what I'm up against.
This is a force more powerful than anything you can imagine.
Even Superman would be helpless against this kind of stench.
And I'll take anything I can get for it.
Maybe I'll buy it.
Are you crazy?
Don't you understand what I'm saying to you?
This isn't just an odor.
You need a priest to get rid of this thing.
- I still smell.
- You see?
You see what I'm saying to you?
It's a presence.
It's the beast.
All right, let me smell you.
Kramer.
Kramer!
- What's that?
What's going on?
- Kramer open up, I know you're there!
- Susan.
- Kramer!
- What is going on?
- You know what's going on?
First, he vomits on me.
Then he burns down my father's cabin.
And now he's taken Mona away from me.
- He stole your girlfriend?
- Yes.
She's in love with him.
Amazing.
I drive them to lesbianism, he brings them back.
Hello.
- She still there?
- No.
She left.
- What is going on?
What did you do?
- I don't know, I didn't do anything.
I was in the video store, and I was practicing my golf swing, you know.
You know, with a broom, and Yeah.
But she saw me take a swing, and she told me that the club is going back too fast.
Well, we started talking.
She's a golf teacher.
So I went to a lesson, and, you know something happened between us.
She's a golf teacher.
I've struck gold!
I've already taken six strokes off my game.
That's the least of what you've accomplished.
I'm gonna have dinner with her.
Can I borrow your jacket?
- Oh, sure.
- Yeah.
Wait a minute.
Kramer, Kramer.
Hold on a second, I don't get this.
This woman has never been with a man her entire life.
I'm Kramer.
Look, I know what you're going through.
Women.
Who knows what they want?
I just don't know what she sees in Kramer.
Listen, you're beautiful.
You're intelligent.
You'll meet other girls.
- You think so?
- Yes, I know so.
You happen to be a very eligible lesbian.
- You're very sweet.
- Hey, I know what I'm talking about.
But I gotta be honest with you, I gotta tell you ever since I saw you holding hands with that woman I can't get you out of my mind.
- Really?
- Yeah.
You're just so hip.
- Oh, my God.
- What?
It's Allison.
I dated her right after you.
She was obsessed with me.
George?
Allison.
Hi.
- Oh, my God.
How are you?
- Good.
You know, you owe me $50.
Fifty dollars, right.
Right.
I don't have it on me right now.
Allison, this is Susan.
Susan, Allison.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
That's a beautiful vest.
Thank you.
I don't understand it.
I was with her last night at my apartment.
It was very romantic.
With that fake wood wallpaper, the atmosphere is fabulous in there now.
It's like a ski lodge.
- What year did you say this was?
- Ninety.
We're on the couch.
I moved to hug her, next she tells me she's leaving she's got to get up early.
- That's strange.
- How many miles you got on this?
Twenty-three thousand.
And I was looking good too.
I had a nice new shirt on.
I'm wearing your jacket.
Wait a second.
My jacket.
I wore that in the car.
The beast.
- This wicked funk.
- What?
I can't sell this car.
This thing.
It's got to be stopped.
- So, what do you want to do?
- Sauce me.
Why do we need BO?
What is the function of it?
Everything in nature has a reason, has a purpose, except BO.
It doesn't make any sense.
Do something good hard work, exercise, you smell very bad.
This is the way the human being is designed.
You move, you stink.
Why can't our bodies help us?
Why can't sweat smell good?
lt'd be a different world, wouldn't it?
Instead of putting your laundry in the hamper, put it in a vase.
Go down to the drug store, pick up some odorant and perspirant.
Probably have a dirty sock hanging from the rearview mirror of your car.
Then on a special night, maybe a little underwear coming out of your breast pocket.
Just to show her that she's important.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
You can't have adultery.
You commit it.
You can't even commit adultery unless you already have a commitment.
So you have to make the commitment before thinking about committing it.
There's no commit without the commit.
Then, once you commit, then you can commit the adultery.
Then you get caught, get divorced, lose your mind and they have you committed.
You know, some people actually cheat on the people they're cheating with which is like, you know, being in a holdup and turning to the robber next to you and going: "All right, give me everything you have too".
You met her at the supermarket?
How?
Produce section.
Very provocative area.
Lots of melons and shapes.
Everyone squeezing and smelling.
It just happened.
- So when you gonna see her?
- Tonight.
- What's her name?
- I don't know.
- How could you not know her name?
- I was nervous.
I got distracted.
It had something to do with a car or a fish.
Look at Why do I get bananas?
They're good for one day.
Oh, my God.
I forgot to tell you.
I got a letter today from the State Controller's Office.
Back in public school in Brooklyn every week I put 50 cents in the Lincoln Savings Bank.
- Yeah, I did that too.
- Remember the little bankbook?
I haven't put anything in it since sixth grade.
I completely forgot about it.
The State Controller's Office tracks me down.
The interest has accumulated to $ 1900.
Nineteen hundred dollars.
They're sending me a check.
Yeah.
Interest.
It's an amazing thing.
You make money without doing anything.
I have some friends that try and base their whole life on that principle.
- Really?
Who?
- Nobody you know.
Maybe I'll go down to the track, put it all on a horse.
Why don't you put it in the bank.
Bank?
This is found money.
I want to parlay it.
I wanna make a big score.
You mean you wanna lose it.
Yeah.
All right.
- You got it, huh?
- Yes, I did.
- Yes.
- What's with the gloves?
Well, I'm staining my floors.
You know, I don't wanna get my hands dirty.
- What, the whole apartment?
- The whole apartment.
And I'm buying that fake-wood wallpaper.
I'm gonna surround myself in wood.
It's gonna be like a log cabin.
Because I need wood around me.
Wood, Jerry.
Wood.
- Wood is good.
- Definitely.
So we're still going to play racquetball, right?
- Yeah.
Whenever you're ready.
- Okay.
Soon as Elaine gets here.
- What, you rented Home Alone?
- Yeah.
- I thought you saw that.
- No, I saw Home Alone 2.
Oh, right.
But you hated it.
Well, I was lost.
I never saw the first one.
- By the way, you mind if I watch it here?
- What for?
If I watch it at my apartment, I feel like I'm not doing anything.
If I watch it here, I'm out of the house, I'm doing something.
All right, go ahead.
- Yeah?
- It's me.
Are you ready to go?
No.
Come on up.
I can't work with these.
- What's wrong?
- You bought me dishwashing gloves.
- There's no fine touch.
- You said "gloves".
No.
No, these are too thick.
- Is that Home Alone?
- Yeah.
The original.
- Hey, boys-o.
- Hey!
Hello.
Hey, get your stuff.
Let's go.
Wait a minute.
There's a change of plans.
- What?
- Remember Roy, the artist?
- Oh, the triangle guy.
- Yeah.
Exactly.
The triangle guy.
Yeah.
You liked him.
What happened?
Yeah, I did.
He was very talented.
He was just, I don't know, a little too - Artsy?
- Fat.
He was a fat starving artist, you know?
- That's very rare.
- Yeah.
Anyway, he's in the hospital, he's having surgery and I should go visit him.
- What's wrong?
Something with his spleen.
It'll just take five minutes.
Okay?
The hospital's right on the way.
- All right.
We'll wait for you.
- I can get some rubber gloves there.
Listen, Jerry, could you do me a favor?
Could you go into the room with me to visit him?
Because I don't want him to think that I'm, you know, interested.
Oh, you want me to pretend to be your boyfriend.
- Well - Well, I think I can do that.
I've played that role before to some critical acclaim.
- All right, let's go.
- All right.
- Yep.
- What's with him?
You know, a lot of people have asked that.
Roy.
Elaine.
What a surprise.
Oh, my God.
I hardly recognize you.
You look so - Yeah, I've lost some weight.
- A lot of weight.
- I know.
- You look terrific.
Thank you.
So do you.
This is You really lost weight.
- Thank you.
- Jerry.
I'm the boyfriend.
Dr. Whittenberg, outside call.
Dr. Whittenberg, outside call.
The mother lode.
I can't believe it.
You were huge.
Like blubber.
I couldn't even get my arms around you.
Yes.
I remember.
Well, that's a positive thing about getting sick.
- You get to lose weight.
- Elaine, it wasn't the illness.
- It was you.
- Me?
Yeah.
After you stopped seeing me, I was devastated.
I couldn't eat for weeks.
Get out!
- Really.
It's the truth.
- Jerry, did you hear this?
He couldn't eat for weeks.
That's terrible.
I had no idea I had that kind of effect on you.
You did.
You know, I can't get this damn thing to sleep.
Now, listen, Roy, tell me something: - When are you getting out of here?
- Next Thursday.
Okay, I tell you what.
How about on Friday I take you out for a big meal, because you are getting too thin.
Honey aren't we going to the Poconos next Friday?
No, that's the week after.
No, I believe it's next week.
- You're wrong.
- No, I'm not.
Shut up.
Pay dirt.
Roy, this is Kramer.
He's one of our friends.
- How do you do?
- I do great.
- Hi, Roy.
- Hey, Dr. Siegel.
Hey, doc, check this out.
- Hey.
- I just learned that.
I just wanted to stop by see if you had any questions about tomorrow's operation.
Yeah, yeah, I have I have a question.
What do you know about interabdominal retractors?
Are you asking because you saw 20/20 last night?
I sure am.
Well, that report was about one very specific type of retractor.
And I can assure you we do not use that retractor in your friend's procedure.
But you will use a retractor.
We have to.
I'll tell you what.
You're obviously concerned about your friend's welfare.
A few of my students will be observing tomorrow's operation from the viewing gallery.
How would you like to watch it with them?
- I'd love to watch the operation, yeah.
- I don't know.
Come on, Jerry, you gotta see the operation.
They're gonna cut him open.
His guts will be all over the place.
- Yeah, that's true.
- They'll saw through bone.
We'll see what's inside bone.
- Hey.
- Hi.
- What are you doing?
You're crying?
- No.
You're crying from Home Alone?
- The old man got to me.
- All right.
Get yourself together.
I don't know if I can be friends with you anymore after this display.
- Oh, shut up.
What are you doing back so soon, anyway?
I never even got to the gym.
Kramer got the gloves wanted to come home and start working on his floor.
- How's the guy?
- He's okay.
In fact, him and Elaine are getting pretty chummy.
Now Elaine wants me to buy some of his art.
- That's nerve.
- Yeah.
So she and triangle boy can go out to fancy restaurants.
You know what it is?
It's Clara Nightingale Syndrome.
- He falls ill, she falls in love.
- You mean Florence Nightingale.
- What did I say, "Clara"?
- You must have meant Clara Barton.
Clara Barton?
What did she do?
I'm not sure, but I think she was nice.
Susan B. Anthony I think I'd have a problem with.
Yeah, I think you would.
So are you gonna buy his art?
No.
Why don't you buy it.
You got $ 1900.
Yeah.
That's what I want.
Triangles.
I'm out of here.
Have fun with whatshername.
I will.
You know, now you gotta ask her her name.
It's so embarrassing.
- No, it isn't.
I can find out.
- Yeah?
How?
There are ways.
You know, I remember when I was a kid growing up kids would make fun of my name like you wouldn't believe.
"Jerry, Jerry, Dingleberry" and "Seinsmelled".
- Seinsmelled?
Yeah.
What about you?
Did people make fun of your name?
Are you kidding?
They were merciless.
What do you expect when your name rhymes with a part of the female anatomy?
Of course, not everybody can be as sweet as you are.
- Oh, Jerry.
- Oh, you.
Now, let's try "breast".
Celeste.
- Kest.
- No.
- Rest.
Sest.
Hest.
- Hest?
That's not a name.
- You should have just asked her.
- I know I should have asked.
- What are you gonna do now?
- I don't know.
I can't ask her now.
I've already made out with her.
Once you make out with a woman, you can't ask her her name.
Aretha.
No.
- Bovary.
- All right, that's enough.
You know what you gotta do?
You gotta go through her purse.
The credit cards, driver's license.
- Well, how am I gonna do that?
- When she goes to the bathroom.
- There you are.
- Hey.
My date stood me up.
Listen, will you guys go to the operation with me?
You asked a date to go to the operation?
Yeah.
So come on.
What do you say?
- What kind of operation is it?
- Splenectomy.
- Isn't that where they remove the?
- Don't ruin it.
I haven't seen it yet.
Now, come on.
What do you say?
Mulva.
Mulva?
Come on, come on.
You wanna go?
- Come on.
Yeah.
- All right.
All right.
Just let me finish my coffee.
Then we'll watch them go slice this fat bastard up.
Now we'll open the peritoneal cavity exposing the body's internal organs.
Nurse, retractor.
- What are you eating?
- Junior Mints.
- You want one?
- No.
Now, I can't see.
Could you get?
Where'd you get those?
- The machine.
You want one?
- No.
- Here.
Take one.
- I don't want one.
- No, they're good.
- I don't want any.
- Just take one.
- No.
Stop Kramer, stop it.
- Did it go in?
- Yes.
Over the balcony, bounced off some respirator thing into the patient.
What do you mean, "Into the patient"?
Into the patient.
Literally.
- Into the hole?
- Yes.
The hole.
- Didn't they notice it?
- No.
- How could they not notice it?
- Because it's a little mint.
It's a Junior Mint.
Well, what did they do?
They sealed him up with the mint inside.
- They left the Junior Mint in him?
- Yes.
Well, l I guess it can't hurt him.
People eat pounds of those things.
Yes, they eat them.
They don't put them next to vital organs in their abdominal cavity.
- Yeah.
- It's me.
Come on up.
Hey.
This wallpaper is very good.
My place looks like a ski lodge.
Why'd you force that mint on me?
I didn't want the mint!
- What?
I didn't believe you.
- How could you not?
Well, who's gonna turn down a Junior Mint?
It's chocolate, it's peppermint.
It's delicious.
- That's true.
- It's very refreshing.
Well, just don't say anything about this to Elaine.
Prognosis negative.
Prognosis negative?
He's not doing well.
The doctors don't know what it is.
They're baffled.
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.
Just my luck, you know?
Just when he was getting thin and attractive.
You know, Jerry, you should buy some of his art.
- That would really lift his spirits.
- It's that bleak?
You know, if the guy dies the art could really be worth something.
- We gotta confess.
- Really?
- Yes.
- We could be tried for murder.
I can't have this on my conscience.
We're Leopold and Loeb.
- You're not saying anything.
- You can't stop me.
No, you're not!
Hey, Elaine, put me down for some of that art.
Nineteen hundred dollars' worth.
Yeah, that's the spot.
What are you so tense about?
Nothing, really.
Just a homicide.
That's terrific Mulva.
What?
Mulva?
Mulva?
My My aunt's name is Mulva.
She's a masseuse.
I'm going to the bathroom.
I'll be right back.
Good idea.
What are you doing?
I was just looking for some gum.
- Or a mint.
- I have Junior Mints.
No!
No.
I mean No, thank you.
No.
- Any news?
- No.
No.
You better get out of here.
No, wait a sec.
Wait a second.
I don't know the name of this woman in the bathroom.
So when she comes out, you introduce yourself.
- She'll be forced to say her name.
- Ten-four.
Okay.
- Hello.
- Hello, I'm Kramer.
- Nice to meet you.
- See you later.
I'd better get going.
I don't wanna be late for the play.
- Okay.
- My cousin knows the producer.
I may get to go backstage and meet Olympia Dukakis.
- There's a name you don't forget.
- Bye, Jerry.
Bye.
- Hi.
- Hi, I'm George.
- Nice to meet you, George.
- Yeah.
I gave it a shot.
So any word on the artiste?
No.
I haven't heard anything.
- Well, I got my triangles.
- Really?
Yep.
You know, they really spruce up the apartment.
Yeah, I'm sure.
I gotta call the hospital.
I gotta tell them what happened.
- No, no.
Jerry, I wouldn't do that.
- Why?
You could get in trouble.
Look, I gotta try and help the guy.
Who are you to play God?
!
Every man's time comes.
If his number is up, who are you to interfere?
Yes, I'd like to speak with Dr. Siegel.
It's about Roy Corning's condition.
- What?
What?
- That's fantastic.
- He didn't get better, did he?
- Thank you very much.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
He's gonna be okay.
Where's the luck?
There's no luck.
Nineteen hundred dollars down the drain.
You saved my life, George.
You buying my art is what inspired me to get better.
I'll never forget what you did for me.
Well, that's great.
It's really great.
You know, art's a great investment.
They'll be great in your apartment.
Yes, I look forward to many years of looking at the triangles.
Well, I'll I'll wait for you outside.
- Hey, George.
- Yeah?
- All right.
- That's nice.
Thanks, Roy.
Hey.
There's the guy who saved my life.
You know, I don't want to totally discount the emotional element in your recovery but I think there were other factors at play here.
- What do you mean?
- I have no medical evidence to back me up, but something happened during the operation that staved off that infection.
Something beyond science.
Something perhaps from above.
Mint?
Those can be very refreshing.
So Elaine where we going for our big dinner on Friday?
I'm so sorry, Roy but, actually, we are going to the Poconos on Friday.
Right, honey?
I don't think so.
Yeah, I believe that we We are.
I believe we're not.
- Please, can we go to the Poconos?
- Well, I'll think about it.
Great seats.
You could see the actors spitting.
Really.
Afterwards, we went backstage, and Olympia Dukakis autographed my playbill.
- Wait a second.
You got her autograph?
- Yeah.
- Do you have it with you?
- Yeah, it's in my purse.
Let me see.
You know, I really think I'm falling for you, Jerry Seinfeld.
Well, I really think I'm falling for you "Joseph Poglia".
I had it autographed for my uncle.
Yeah, I know.
You don't know my name, do you?
- Yes, I do.
- What is it?
It rhymes with a female body part.
What is it?
Mulva?
Gipple?
Loleola?
Dolores!
Ages 0 through 10, candy is your life.
There's nothing else.
Family, friends, school, they're only obstacles in the way of getting more candy.
You have your favorite candies that you love.
You know, "I love those.
I hate those.
I hate those.
I love those".
Only a 7-year-old kid can actually taste the difference between, like, a red M&M and a light-brown M&M.
That's two totally different things when you're a 7-year-old.
"Well, your red is more of a main-course M&M but the brown, it's a more of a mellower flavor.
It's an after-dinner M&M, really".
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
To me, the whole concept of fear of success is proof that we are definitely scraping the bottom of the fear barrel.
Will we have to have AA-type meetings for these people?
"Hi, my name is Bill, and the one thing I'm worried about is having a stereo and a cream-colored couch".
According to most studies, people's number-one fear is public speaking.
Number two is death.
Death is number two.
Now, this means to the average person, if you have to go to a funeral you're better off in the casket than doing the eulogy.
Why can't I play Kramer?
Look, we've been through this already.
You're not an actor.
- Well, neither are you.
- I know.
Why do we need two people that can't act?
Oh, come on, Jerry.
How hard is it to act?
You say something.
I'll pretend it's funny.
- What?
- My grandmother's in the hospital.
Your grandmother's in the hospital.
- This is real believable.
- You didn't think I was laughing?
- It stinks.
- All right, let me see you do it.
- Say something funny.
- All right.
I've never been to Mars, but I imagine it's quite lovely.
Mine was better than that.
Come on, look: - Why are you pretending to laugh?
- We're acting.
Oh, yeah, real good.
- Any word from NBC?
- No.
I don't understand.
They're supposed to be casting this week.
Maybe they're not doing it.
Well, at least let me audition.
He wants to play Kramer in the pilot.
Out of the question.
How could we not hear anything?
What's with this Russell?
What's he doing?
Hi, Russell.
Sit.
Sit down.
It's okay.
I really appreciate you coming.
Oh, that's okay.
l I don't have much time, though, so All right, well, first of all I want to apologize for all the phone calls.
It's just It's just I don't understand.
We went out once, and Yeah, that was two months ago.
Yes, I know, and l l I just I can't get you out of my mind.
Ever since that The day in that restaurant when we met - Do you have a ketchup secret?
- No, but Russell, you are the president of NBC.
You can have any woman you want.
But I want you.
God, I hate these mixtures.
I don't know why Why don't they just put pretzels out on the table?
Or even peanuts would be good, but I don't know who eats these cheesy things.
Is it something I said?
Or did?
Look, Russell you're a very sweet guy, but I gotta be honest with you.
I don't like television.
And that's your world.
That's your life.
Maybe if you were in Greenpeace or something, that would be different but network television, I mean come on, Russell.
You're part of the problem.
Elaine, we're doing some very interesting things right now.
We've got very exciting pilots for next season.
We have one with a bright young comedian, Jerry Seinfeld.
Oh, yeah, you know, I've heard of him.
He's that: "Did you ever notice this?
Did you ever notice that"?
guy.
In fact, he was in the restaurant the day that we met.
Well, anyway, it's a groundbreaking show.
Really?
What is it about?
Well, really It's It's really It's very unusual.
It's about nothing.
What do you mean, it's about nothing?
For example, what did you do today?
I got up.
I went to work.
Then I came here.
There's a show.
That's a show.
Russell, see, I'm really not interested in this and I do have to go to work, so - Elaine, when?
When are we?
- When are we gonna see each other?
- I'm sorry, Russell.
I'm sorry, okay?
Bye-bye.
- So I'll see you later, huh?
- Yeah.
Hello.
Yeah, he's here.
Hey!
- It's for you.
- Oh, yeah?
He's getting phone calls here now?
Hello.
Again with the sweatpants?
What?
I'm comfortable.
You know the message you're sending with these sweatpants?
You're telling the world, "I give up.
I can't compete in normal society.
I'm miserable, so I might as well be comfortable".
Hold on a second, I got another call.
Hello.
Yeah, he'll call you back.
- Who is it?
- That's NBC.
NBC?
!
Give me the phone!
- I'm having a conversation here.
- Get off the phone.
Okay, look, I'll call you back.
Yeah.
You know I'm waiting to hear from them.
- Who was it?
- Russell Dalrymple's secretary.
All right.
Now you're doing something to help me.
Hello.
Yes, it's Jerry Seinfeld returning the call.
Okay, great.
Thanks a lot.
Casting tomorrow at NBC, 4:00.
We're in business.
The pilot's on!
You're gonna be successful.
What if the pilot gets picked up and it becomes a series?
That would be wonderful.
You'll be rich and successful.
That's why I'm worried.
God will kill me before letting me be successful.
- He'll never let me be happy.
- You don't believe in God.
I do for the bad things.
Do you hear what you're saying?
God isn't out to get you, George.
What?
What is that on your lip?
- What?
- It's like a discoloration.
It's white.
Yes.
Yes, it's white.
- Why is that white?
- You'd better get that checked out.
- "Better get that checked out"?
- I would.
What kind of a therapist are you?
I'm telling you I'm scared something will happen and you look for tumors?
- I'm trying to help you.
- What are you, like, a sadist?
No matter how bad somebody feels, you can make it worse.
- You're rooting for a tumor.
- You'd better go.
I'm going, baby.
I'm going!
- Where?
- Right here.
Get out of here, it's nothing.
Excuse me.
Do you see anything on my lip?
Yeah.
Like a discoloration.
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, it's all white.
It's all white, Jerry.
It's all white.
Would you stop?
I'd get that checked out.
Again with the checked out.
I'm not going to the doctor.
If I don't, nothing will happen.
If I go, he might find something.
If you go, maybe they'll catch it in time.
Catch what in time?
- Whatever it is.
- You think it's something?
I hate these bums with their rags.
No, no, no, I don't want it.
Get away.
Get away.
Get away from my car.
You know, these squeegee Oh, my God, it's Crazy Joe Davola.
Good luck on the pilot, Jerry.
Yeah, I think I see it.
It's like a white discoloration.
What do you think it is?
It's like a white discoloration.
Okay, guys, are we ready to start?
Where's Russell?
I thought he was gonna be here.
I don't know.
I saw him this morning, and I said hello.
He walked past me.
He must be worried about the fall schedule.
- It's a real bear.
- Yeah.
So, what's going on?
We're gonna shoot the pilot then it's gonna be on TV the next week?
Yeah, right.
This is Mark Matts.
He'll be auditioning for the role of George.
- How you doing?
- Hey, Mark, how are you?
They've gotta be kidding.
This guy's perfect.
Okay, let's read this.
And I'll be reading Jerry's part.
Anyone call for Vandelay Industries?
- No, why?
- Listen to me.
I told the unemployment office I was close to a job with them and I gave them your number.
When you answer the phone, you've got to say, "Vandelay Industries".
- I'm Vandelay Industries?
- Right.
- What is that?
- You're in latex.
What do I do with latex?
I don't know.
You manufacture it.
This is Michael Barth, another George.
- Hi, Michael.
- How you doing?
- Everything all right?
- I just came from the podiatrist.
Something's wrong with my foot.
A little gangrene.
They'll probably have to amputate.
Any questions?
What are we looking at?
Is this guy a real loser?
No, not a loser.
Let's start with the second scene.
You have it?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
A man gave me a massage.
So?
Well, he He had his hands, you know and he was - He was what?
Well, he was, you know He was touching and rubbing.
That's a massage.
I think it moved.
This is Melissa Shannon.
- Hi.
- Hi, how you doing?
Melissa is reading for Elaine.
It's like a bald convention out there.
Sorry, I made a faux pas.
No, you didn't, he knows he's bald.
So how about that guy wearing sweatpants?
Is that for the part, or does he walk around like that?
Okay.
Shall we start?
You know what?
I'll read with her.
Oh, great.
- All right, wanna start?
- Yeah.
Okay.
- What was that look?
- What look?
That look you just gave me.
- I gave a look?
- Yes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Let's see some more Kramers.
- Hi, how you doing?
- Hi.
- How you doing?
- Good.
- What is this about?
- Levels.
- Levels?
- Yeah.
Getting rid of all my furniture.
All of it.
I'm building levels with steps, completely carpeted with pillows.
Like ancient Egypt.
How are you gonna be comfortable like that?
I'll be comfortable.
- Very good.
- Very nice.
Tom, that was terrific.
Thank you for coming in.
- Wonderful reading.
- That's really something.
- Bye.
- Okay.
Thank you.
Take it easy.
I thought he was really good, very funny.
Yeah, I liked him.
What happened to the raisins?
Yeah, there was a box of raisins there.
Did he just steal the raisins?
You think he stole them?
This is Martin Van Nostrand.
- What are you doing here?
- You two know each other?
Wait a minute.
I know you.
You're the guy from the Calvin Klein underwear ads.
That's true.
I saw Joe DiMaggio in Dinky Doughnuts again.
But this time I went in.
Where's the bathroom?
I think if you go down the hall, it's on the right at the very end.
Be right back.
Sorry, buddy.
Full house.
Sorry.
Customers only.
Hey, you need a ticket.
- So who's playing Elaine?
- Oh, don't worry about it.
Very talented young actress.
- Really?
- Yes.
- Who is it?
- She's an Eskimo, actually.
- Oh, God.
- She came down from Juneau by sled.
She was in the Iditarod.
Got to the finish line, just kept going.
She's got the dogs with her in the hotel room.
Listen, was Russell at the casting?
No, he didn't show up.
You know l'm a little bit worried about him.
I don't understand.
We had one date two months ago.
Am I that charming and beautiful?
No.
No, you're not.
- Why do I keep setting you up?
- I don't know.
Could we get a little more?
Heat more.
Ever since this new owner took over, the service here is really slow.
Yeah.
Have you noticed anything else that's different since the new management?
They're putting a little lemon in the tuna.
I love that.
Besides that.
Look at the waitresses.
Yeah?
What physical characteristic would you say is common to all of them?
I mean, look at this.
Every waitress working here has the same proportions, wouldn't you say?
Yes.
I would say.
What's going on here?
How is this possible?
- Do you think it's a coincidence?
- No.
l I haven't seen four women like this together outside of a Russ Meyer film.
Hi.
Excuse me.
Who does all the hiring of waitresses here?
He does.
We're looking for another girl if you know anyone.
You know what?
That's discriminatory.
That is unfair.
Why should these women have all the advantages?
They get all the attention from men.
They get all the waitress jobs too?
Hey, that's life.
Good-looking men have the same advantage.
You don't see any handsome homeless.
You see, it's right here.
It's It's a little white.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
I've never seen this before.
"Never seen this before"?
I'm gonna have to take a biopsy on this.
- A what?
- A biopsy.
- A biopsy?
- Yeah.
Cancer?
Is it cancer?
Do I have cancer?
Well, I don't know what it is.
He took a biopsy, Jerry.
A biopsy.
- What'd he say?
- He didn't know what it was.
All right, so?
When I asked him about cancer, he didn't say, "Get out of here".
That's what I wanted to hear, "Cancer?
Get out of here".
Maybe he doesn't have a "get out of here" kind of personality.
How could a doctor not say, "Get out of here"?
It should be part of medical school training.
"Cancer?
Get out of here.
Go home.
What are you, crazy?
It's a little test.
It's nothing.
You're a real nut, you know that"?
Told you God would never let me be successful.
I never should've written that pilot.
The show will be a hit, make millions, and I'll be dead.
Dead, Jerry.
Because of this.
Can't you at least die with a little dignity?
No, I can't.
I can't die with dignity.
I have no dignity.
I want to be the person who doesn't die with dignity.
I lived my whole life in shame.
Why die with dignity?
Hey.
What happened to you yesterday?
I got mugged.
- You got mugged?
- Mugged?
I wouldn't have minded, but I was running home to go to the bathroom.
- Why didn't you use it in the building?
- It was full.
I tried a few other places, you know, but that didn't work.
I mean, it was an emergency, Jerry.
I was really percolating.
So I decided to run home through the park, and then two guys stopped me.
- Yeah?
- It's me.
Come on up.
Now I got a big problem, buddy.
- What is it?
- Well I waited so long, l I missed my chance.
- You didn't go?
- No, and now I can't get it back.
The best thing to do is just not think about it.
How could you not think about it?
- Hey.
- Hey.
What's the matter with him?
He's a little backed-up.
Elaine.
So I spoke to some of my sisters about that coffee shop.
Oh, the sisters.
Have you seen the waitresses in there?
I never had so much coffee in my life.
So we decided I should go over there and apply for a job myself.
Apply for a job?
What for?
Because it's discriminatory.
It's a coincidence.
- This is what you're gonna wear?
- Yeah.
You're not gonna get the job.
Exactly.
Hello.
Oh, hi.
Yeah, I guess we could do that.
At what time?
All right.
I'll see you there.
Okay, bye.
- Who's that?
- TV Elaine.
She wants to talk about the part.
- What about the dogs?
- They're having sex in the hotel room.
So the Elaine character is based on someone you know.
- Yes.
- And she's really your ex-girlfriend.
- Yeah.
- I want to know her from the inside.
What is she like?
Tell me about her.
Well, she's fascinated with Greenland.
She enjoys teasing animals Banlon and seeing people running for their lives.
She loves throwing garbage out the window, yet she's extremely dainty.
How would she eat a hamburger?
- With her hands.
- What about pasta?
Also with her hands.
Seriously.
I want to experience everything she's experienced.
Everything?
- Everything.
- All right, she cuts pasta with a knife.
Good.
What's her favorite movie?
Shaft.
You gotta give me her picture.
What about sex?
She likes talking during sex.
Dirty talking?
No.
Just chitchat, movies, current events.
Regular stuff.
- You know, Sandi - Elaine.
- What?
- Call me Elaine.
All right Elaine.
- How does Elaine kiss?
- Well - Does she kiss like this?
Actually, she has a thing where she spirals her tongue around.
It's like a Like this?
I think you got it.
Now, I like to eat spaghetti with just a fork.
Because I can keep the strands long and I can slurp it up to my mouth like this.
Look.
Now, sex, I like the bottom.
Let them do all the work, you know?
You should be writing this stuff down.
Yeah.
Bran flakes.
One hundred percent.
I got a big problem.
- And I'll have the hamburger.
That's it.
- Yeah.
- Thanks a lot.
- That's good.
Now, I like to play golf.
Look, this stuff doesn't matter to me.
See, I'm gonna do the character like me, not like you.
You gotta play him like me.
I'm Kramer.
- I'm Kramer.
- I'm Kramer.
What can I do for you?
Would you like table?
No, I'd like to apply for a waitress job.
Have you ever waited on tables before?
Oh, yeah.
I've been a professional waitress for the last 10 years.
I've worked all over this city.
These are my references.
I'm sure you'll find that I'm more than qualified.
I don't think I need anyone else right now.
You're in big trouble, mister!
And I mean trouble with a capital T!
What?
What did I do?
Anyway, there's at least four of them, and they're all huge.
I mean, one is bigger than the next.
It's like a Russ Meyer movie.
Who's Russ Meyer?
He's this guy who made these terrible movies in the '70s with these kinds of women.
He's obsessed.
He's obsessed with breasts.
That's hard to say.
Anyway, go on.
There's not really much more to tell.
He was looking for waitresses I went in to apply, and he looked me up and down, and he rejected me.
Paul, come here for a second.
I want you to listen to this.
- Hi.
- Hi.
The woman here claims there's a restaurant on the West Side that's only hiring large-breasted women.
Really?
- What do you mean, made-up?
- It's made-up.
Häagen-Dazs is made-up.
It's not Danish.
- You're crazy.
- No, I'm not.
George, is Häagen-Dazs Danish?
- What do you mean, Danish?
- This guy stinks.
Danish.
Is it from Denmark?
They make it in New Jersey.
It's just a Danish-sounding name.
I can't believe that.
They fooled me, Jerry.
Boy, talk about a show about nothing.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
This This is not right.
May I?
You see, you're going: "They fooled me, Jerry".
You want to hit "fooled" more.
"They fooled me, Jerry".
You see the difference?
I'm not gonna say it like that.
Just a suggestion.
All right, everybody.
- Take a five.
- Yep, that's five.
George?
I don't have much experience with acting but from what I can gather they're a little touchy about being told how to say the lines.
Why is that?
I don't know, but they don't seem to like it.
By the way, how am I doing?
Oh, you're You're fine.
You're fine.
So you think this guy playing Kramer took the raisins?
Why would he steal a box of raisins?
Yeah.
It's bizarre.
That little bald guy's driving me nuts.
I'm gonna rip him a new one if he doesn't leave me alone.
I wish that was our real problem.
What is the real problem?
It's Seinfeld.
He can't act.
It's pathetic.
I told you these stand-ups can't act.
I'm cringing watching him.
What's with him?
Russell?
Russell?
- What?
- You okay?
Yeah.
No, l I was just thinking of something.
I'll be back in a second.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
You're acting weird.
Is anything wrong?
No.
Are you breaking up with me?
Are we going out?
You're breaking up with me, aren't you?
Do you want me to?
If that's what you want.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Fine, break up with me.
All right, we're broken up.
Can we still be friends?
- Remember when you auditioned?
- Yeah.
There was a box of raisins on the coffee table.
Did you, by any chance, take them with you when you left?
What are you talking about?
Well, we were all eating the raisins.
And I remember you You were eating some of the raisins.
And then you left and the raisins were gone.
I was just wondering if, you know maybe you took them with you.
Are you accusing me of stealing the raisins?
- Oh, no, no - Why would I steal a box of raisins?
No, you wouldn't.
Nobody would, you know.
It's just that they were missing, and well, I'm just inquiring.
Let me give you a word of advice, okay?
Stay away from me.
I don't wanna talk to you.
And I don't wanna hear any more of your stupid notes and suggestions.
I don't like you.
So if you got any other problems, whether it's raisins, prunes figs or any other dried fruit just keep it to yourself and stay out of my way, okay?
All right.
I don't think we're gonna have any problem with that.
Good talking to you, Tom.

- What about me?
I was a total failure.
Everything was fine.
Now this thing's gonna be a success, and God gives me a terminal disease.
This actress playing Elaine, she's crazy.
The guy playing Kramer threatened me.
- Why?
- I asked him about the raisins.
You mentioned the raisins.
- Oh, yeah.
- Did he take them?
I don't know.
Well, if he didn't take them what happened to them?
That's what I'm trying to find out.

- Hey.
- Any luck?
- No.
No, nothing.
I got no peristalsis.

Well, my friend it may be time to consider the dreaded apparatus.
Hold it right there.
If you're suggesting what I think, you're wasting your time.
I am not, Jerry, under any circumstances, doing any inserting in that area.
Oh, it's not that bad.
Yes, it is.
Well it's all taken care of.
I filed a report.
An investigation is under way.
So you going to the taping?
No, I don't think I should go.
I don't want to bump into Russell.
He called me the other day.
Come on, you gotta go.
He's harmless.
He's got a little crush on you.
Jerry, this is not a crush.
This is a complete fixation.
He makes me very uncomfortable.
We need you there.
- Hey, are you gonna go?
- No, no, l I'm gonna stay home.
I I wanna be close to my home base, in case there's any news from the front.
No.
Pick it up more in the front.

Why?
Why?
What?
Negative's good?
Yes, of course.
How stupid of me.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
What was I worried about?
Listen.
I know we've had our problems in the past but we got a show to do tonight.
Time to pull together as a team.
Life's too short.
I say, let's let bygones be bygones.
If you took the raisins, if you didn't take the raisins They weren't even my raisins.
l I was just curious because seems like a strange thing to do to walk into a room, audition and walk out with a box of raisins.
Anyway, whatever.
If you ever want to tell me about it, the door to my office is always open.
In the event that I get an office.
You'll come in.
We'll talk about the raisins.
We'll have a nice laugh.
How would you like it if I just pulled your heart out of your chest now and shoved it down your throat?
Good evening.
Welcome to a taping of the new show Jerry.
Does everybody know what a pilot is?

And we hope it becomes a series.
It's called Jerry.
I'm playing Jerry Sic semper tyrannis!
What about Davola?
Did you believe that?
What was that thing he yelled out, sic semper tyrannis?
Is that Latin?
John Wilkes Booth yelled it when he shot Lincoln.
- Really?
What's it mean?
- It means "death to tyrants".
I could see that.
See, now, this is exciting!
This is exciting!
- Did I miss anything already?
- No, it starts in five minutes.
You were there.
What's the big deal?
Now it's on TV.
It's different.
- I told everybody I know to watch it.
- Yeah, me too.
- Did you hear from Russell?
- No.
Strange, him not showing up at the taping.
Well, well.
- Congratulations.
- Well, thank you.
- You went for the big E, huh?
- Wet and wild.
- Kramer, sit down.
It's about to start.
- Oh, yes.
Hey, what is this?
Look, a wallet.
- A wallet?
Let me see that.
- Here.
It's my father's wallet.
He thought they stole it at the doctor's office.
- This is it.
- How do you like that?
You hurt me.
- Hey.
- Hey, George.
- New sneakers?
- Yeah.
- What do you need new sneakers for?
- I like sneakers.
How do you decide which ones to wear?
I'd go crazy if I had to decide.
You're crazy anyway.
Why did you eat the top off the muffins?
- So what?
- I can't eat it now.
- George.
- George.
What kind of stupid show is this?
Hey, that's that idiot that took all my records.
John, what are you doing?
Come back to bed.
This show looks interesting.
Isn't he that Seinfeld fella you went out with?
Oh, he's horrible.
Horrible.
Nevertheless.
That Jerry's a funny guy, huh?
Got to love the "Sein".
I hate the "Sein".
This is a piece of crap.
Oh, Donald, you used to like him.
What a sellout.
Give me that remote.
Give me that.
- Give me the remote.
- Donald.
- Jerry, the commercial's almost over.
- All right.
You know, I really like this guy playing the butler.
Yeah, he's good.
He's John Ritter's cousin.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Hello, Charles.
- Hello.
So where do you want me to start today?
- Why don't you start in the bedroom.
- I'll start in your bedroom.
- Hey.
- Hey.
The butler's here.
He is?
Listen.
When he's finished, send him over to my house.
- I'm not sending him to your house.
- Why not?
The judge decreed he'd become my butler, not my friend's butler.
Jerry, he is your butler.
You can give him any order you want.
- That's what butlers do.
- But I don't want to.
Jerry, my house is a pigsty.
Come on.
- Yeah?
- It's Elaine.
Come on up.
- I need more Pledge.
- More Pledge?
I just bought two cans last week, and I don't have any wood here.
Well, it goes fast.
Hello.
Hello.
What's all this about?
- We had a date last week.
- You had a date?
You went out with my butler?
Who said you could go out with my butler?
- Why do I need your permission?
- Because he's my butler.
That's terrific.
How could anyone not like him?
I like his style.
He has a sort of casual elegance.
But he picks his nose.
Nevertheless.
He's a member of our health club, isn't he?
Yeah.
You know, that Kim Novak had some big breasts.
You ever notice a lot of butlers are named Jeeves?
You know, I think when you When you name a baby Jeeves you've pretty much mapped out his future, wouldn't you say?
Not much chance he's gonna be a hit man, I think, after that.
"I'm terribly sorry, sir, but I'm going to have to whack you".
Yeah.
Oh, wow, that was great.
That show was so funny.
It was really funny.
I'm not just saying that because I know you.
All right.
Well, let's go out and celebrate.
- That was so good.
- Come on, let's eat something.
I think this will get picked up, George.
You're gonna be rich!
- You really think so?
- Oh, yeah.
And God didn't kill me.
- Hello?
- Hi, Jerry.
- This is Rita Kirson.
- Oh, hi, Rita.
I'm calling to let you know Russell Dalrymple is no longer with this network.
Oh, my God.
Did he get fired?
To be honest with you, nobody really knows.
He seems to have disappeared.
Russell's disappeared?
In any event, I've been made the new president of NBC.
As you may or may not know Russell and I did not see eye to eye on many, many projects.
And as my first order of business, I'm passing on your show.
You're passing already?
The show just ended two minutes ago.
Well, I just got the job.
Goodbye, Jerry.
Yeah.
See you.
What are you?
What are you looking at me for?
- It was you.
- What?
What did I do?
Do you realize his obsession with you cost us a TV series?
!
I didn't know that he'd fall for me, and I'd drive him insane, I mean - You know, that's not my fault.
- Yes, it is!
You're very charming!
I can't believe this.
What happened to him?
Where is he?
No one knows.
She works for Pendant Publishing.
She's the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
You know I used to work for NBC, but when I go back to her this time she'll respect me.
You'd better get down.
They might start firing soon.
Hey, look at this.
What is going on here?
Well, well.
Nothing has changed.
How did this happen?
I talked to these guys at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
Hey.
What are you two guys doing here?
I thought you were gonna do something.
Now you're eating here?
No, that's That's That's why we're here.
We're checking things out.
- We're checking it out.
- Checking it out?
See you back at the office, guys.
Fred, Paul, lunch and dinner?
Boy, you guys ought to move in.
How about a piece of pie, on me, huh?
Sophia, take care of these fellows.
Hey, come here.
I want you to know something.
You are not gonna get away with this.
- Get away with what?
- "With what"?
You know what.
With the waitresses, how they're all alike.
Of course they're alike.
They are my daughters.
Your daughters.
You must be very proud, Mr. Visaki.
And may I say, sir, they're lovely girls.
Absolutely lovely girls.
It's nice to see such fine, upstanding women in gainful employment, Mr. Visaki.
- Here's table for you.
- Oh, a table right here.
- Peggy.
Peggy.
All right.

His daughter Peggy.

One of the family.

Thank you very much.
- So guess what I gotta do tomorrow.
- What?
Start looking for a job.
You know what you ought to do?
You should work for Greenpeace.
You know, they attack the whalers out on the open sea.
Are you crazy?
You take your life in your hands with those nuts.
Keep fighting it, matey.
Get your head above the water.
I've got you, matey.
I got you.
Matey.
I'll remember her name.
Elaine Benes.
I'll write to her.
I'll tell her all about you and what you did out here.
Goodbye, matey.
Goodbye.
Now, I know women often complain about the number of things you have to do to get male attention.
The high heels, the pantyhose, the makeup.
It's even worse if you're a man.
If you're a man, you don't know what to do.
That's why we're building bridges, climbing mountains exploring uncharted territories.
You think we wanna do these things?
Nobody wants to build a bridge.
It's really, really hard.
Designing rockets, flying off into space.
I guarantee you, every astronaut, when he comes back from space goes up to a girl and goes, "So did you see me up there"?
