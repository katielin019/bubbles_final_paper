{START OF EPISODE 1}
They say the Everglades are drying up and being built on.
- No.
- Yes.
Such a beautiful place.
Eventually, there won't be any land anywhere.
It's a shame.
Oh, it is.
It really is.
- You know what's also a shame?
- What?
When you sit down and your thighs become twice their size, that's a shame.
I am so excited about this.
Mink breeding is great idea.
- I didn't think you'd like it.
- Why?
I know how you feel about animals.
Since it's for fur, they'll have to be killed.
- I didn't think you'd go for it.
- Do they have to be killed?
No, Rose.
Many women like wearing coats that urinate.
I understand.
I grew up on a farm.
I'm used to it.
You see, farmers, they love animals but kill 'em cos it's the cycle of life.
Good animals serve man and go to heaven.
- Heaven?
- Yes.
Heaven's full of cows and chickens and horses and pigs.
I hope heaven has boots.
Isn't Blanche gonna help?
She won't come out of her room.
She's never been in there that long.
Except for that time with the lifeguard.
She must really be depressed.
She'll cheer up when the minks come.
If they come from Neiman Marcus.
Did Stan ever get you a mink coat?
Stan wouldn't get a popcorn at the movies.
I always wanted mink.
I thought I would look elegant and impressive.
We didn't have mink in Sicily.
To impress someone, you shot their brother.
Oh, Blanche, you must be feeling better.
Better?
Better?
- Blanche?
What's wrong?
- Nothing.
- What is it, Blanche?
- Nothing.
You've been crying, honey.
Or are those tears of joy?
Joy.
Joy.
- Was that joy?
- It doesn't look like joy.
- What is wrong?
- I'm eating.
- Eating is good.
- I'm nauseated.
- Then stop eating.
- How did this happen to me?
How?
- What, Blanche?
- Oh, my God.
Blanche, please, tell us what's wrong.
We're your friends.
Nothing's so terrible we wouldn't understand.
You can tell us.
What is it?
I'm pregnant.
- Rose.
- Rose.
Rose.
Play nice, girls.
Sophia.
She fainted.
Are you all right, honey?
I don't know what happened.
I just saw stars and blackness.
It was like being at the planetarium.
- It was the shock of the news.
- Sorry, Blanche.
No, it's quite all right.
It was shocking news.
I would have fainted myself, only I was afraid I'd fall down and chip my beautiful teeth.
- What shocking news?
- Blanche is pregnant.
Holy cow.
Blanche, are you sure?
I did a home pregnancy test.
It's right here.
It looks like a perfume sample.
Put it behind your ears, Rose.
See, it starts out red, and if it doesn't change colour, they say you're not pregnant.
If you are, it turns pink or grey.
I had drapes that colour.
I think it's called puce.
Is that puce?
I always wondered.
So the decorator told me.
- It looks lavender to me.
- I hated those drapes.
Lavender brings out my eyes.
- Your eyes aren't lavender - Girls.
Blanche, who's the father?
The father?
Gee, I don't know.
You'd better figure it out.
When was your fertile period?
I'm nine weeks late, it was two weeks before, so 11 weeks ago.
Nine weeks late and you just realised something is wrong?
Yes.
I kinda lost track.
Get your book and find out what you did that week.
We know what she did.
We don't know with who.
We had a pig once.
The male pigs loved her.
She was beautiful.
And she got pregnant and we never knew who the father was.
Oh, my God, Rose.
What did you do on Father's Day?
- Week of the 7th.
Let's see.
- Who was it?
- Blanche?
- I don't know.
But, Blanche, who did you see?
That was a particularly active time for me.
I looked stunning.
I'd had my teeth bonded.
I was irresistible.
- Who, Blanche?
- A few people.
How many is a few?
Two?
Three?
Do we hear four?
That was more like a ten-day two-week span.
For me, that's a lifetime span.
Not even.
You realise I'll be 65 when this child graduates high school?
Try 70.
I'll be the oldest mother.
What I loved about my children was everybody thought I was their sister.
My body won't recover this time.
It barely did last time.
This is too depressing.
I'm going back to bed.
A baby.
She's gonna have a baby.
She can name it after its father, Rick Joe Bob Don Dave.
We've done everything to get them in the mood.
Music, soft lighting.
What else can we do?
Leave them alone.
You're always here, looking.
It's sick.
I'm not always here, Sophia.
I work.
You call at lunchtime.
Sophia, go take a look.
- They need an aphrodisiac.
- An African what?
An aphrodisiac.
It's a substance that makes you feel sexy.
Really?
Like what?
- Like Spanish fly.
- Spanish flies?
Fly.
Fly, Rose.
One fly.
Come on, Dorothy.
I've been to Spain.
It's not the cleanest country in the world.
They got thousands of flies.
Valencia alone It is not a fly, Rose.
- Spanish fly is not a fly?
- It's a beetle.
- A fly that's really a beetle?
- Yes.
- How do they know it's Spanish?
- It wears a little sombrero.
Why don't they just call it a beetle, Spanish beetle?
Because they call it Spanish fly.
- What do they call their flies?
- I don't care, Rose.
Forget it.
I don't care.
The minks can sit there and we'll lose our money.
Just don't mention Spanish fly to me again.
You're really touchy about these Spanish flies, aren't you?
Blanche, what did the doctor say?
Say?
Say?
Blanche?
What happened?
- Blanche?
- She's in there.
Really, Columbo?
Yes.
- Blanche, come on.
- What did the doctor say?
- The worst thing.
- Oh, no, honey.
It's not.
It's OK.
The baby's gonna be fine.
You'll have amniocentesis, and the baby will be fine.
We'll help you.
The baby will have three mothers.
It'll be fun.
We can take turns feeding him, waking up with him.
I can do the car pools for school.
I'll help with homework.
I'm a teacher.
Then we can send him to the University of Minnesota.
Minnesota.
Are you crazy, Rose?
This kid is going to Harvard.
Oh, Dorothy.
Those Ivy League schools are so snotty with those preppy people.
- Minnesota has a nice mix.
- Of cattle, maybe.
- This boy goes to Harvard.
- Who says?
We'll vote.
Nobody is going to vote for Minnesota over Harvard, Rose.
- Oh, really?
- He's not going anywhere.
- It's a girl?
- Neither.
I'm not pregnant.
It's worse.
It's much worse.
- Blanche, what is it?
- My life is over.
Oh, Blanche.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for thinking all those bad things about you when I thought you were pregnant.
Like what a slut you were for having all those men.
The things only a tramp would do.
But now that you're dying, please forgive me, I didn't know.
I am not dying, but I might as well be.
It's menopause.
As far as I'm concerned, this is the end of my life.
I don't know why I'm seeing a psychiatrist.
Because you haven't gotten out of bed all week.
You don't eat or sleep, just cry.
You see him or we do.
I don't know why you all have to be with me.
Because you're having lunch at Wolfie's after.
See him?
Total fruitcake.
We're talking serial murderer.
When somebody tries to murder his cereal, he should see a psychiatrist.
Don't talk for the rest of the afternoon.
Ma, perfectly normal people see psychiatrists.
It's like talking to an old, knowledgeable, good friend.
If that was the case, they wouldn't call them psychiatrists.
They'd call them friends.
Psychiatrists means "psych".
For psycho.
- It does not.
- She's right.
I'm not staying.
He'll think I'm crazy cos why else would I be here?
- Blanche.
- Take your hands off me.
I won't talk to a perfect stranger who thinks I'm crazy and reveal my secrets.
I won't do it.
I can't.
Pull yourself together.
You're in a psychiatrist's office.
- Blanche Deveraux.
- Oh, my God.
You go on, honey.
We'll be right here.
See him?
Banana boat time.
He's talking to himself.
He is not.
He's wearing dentures and they keep slipping.
Sure, right.
Excuse me, sir, are you talking to yourself?
Franwok is talking to me.
He's my Martian friend who landed his spacecraft in my yard.
See you at Wolfie's.
But why is your life over?
Because it is.
Because it means I'm old.
It means I'm not a real woman anymore.
It really means you can no longer bear children.
It means much more than that.
I just don't know how it happened.
Only yesterday, I was Magnolia Queen.
I remember my Aunt Lynette going crazy about that time, my mother saying in a hushed voice, "She's going through the change".
I thought, "Poor Aunt Lynette having to go through this change thing".
I had no idea what it was, but I knew it was never going to happen to me.
- Here I am.
I'm Aunt Lynette.
- No, you're not.
You're Blanche, and all that's happening is a biological process, which means one thing and one thing only: You can no longer have children.
It means more than that.
Much more.
I can't even believe I'm really here.
At this point in my life, I can't believe we're having this conversation about me.
It's hard for you to accept.
Nobody in my family has ever seen a psychiatrist.
Except, of course, when they were institutionalised.
It's just so awful.
But you're a man.
You wouldn't understand.
Why wouldn't I understand?
You don't get old and lose your appeal the way women do.
Cary Grant can have any woman he wants in his 80s.
Show me a woman like that.
Don't say Joan Collins.
She belongs in a wax museum.
It's not just menopause.
It's what it represents to you.
- Growing older.
- Yes.
Representing a loss of attractiveness.
Yes.
- Is that all it is, sex appeal?
- Yes.
- Men only value that in you?
- They used to.
Now my only hope is to become an intellectual and find a retired Jew.
Blanche, you have to change your thinking.
You have to find all the other things you are, all the other ways you please people.
There's more to you than you know.
Sometimes I look in the mirror and see my mother looking at me.
Not all the time.
Just now and then, when the light's too bright, or it's too early, or late, or I look real fast.
There it is, my mother's face.
It scares me to death.
It just scares me to death.
I get so depressed, I don't want to get out of bed in the morning.
I don't want to get out of bed ever again.
I hope Dr Parks can get those minks in the mood.
He's a wonderful vet.
He'll solve the problem.
Blanche, you're out of bed.
This is wonderful.
No, it is not wonderful, Dorothy.
I was in bed, eating.
If I don't get up, I'll be like a hippo.
And life has to go on in one form or the other.
I'll just spend my remaining years in the company of women.
Only reason I'm sticking around is to read Danielle Steel's next book.
This is because of the change?
God, I hate that expression.
What is the big deal?
It's nothing.
Look at this way.
You don't get cramps once a month.
You don't go on eating binges once a month.
You just grow a beard.
Don't listen to her, Blanche.
Believe me.
I woke up one morning, I looked like Arafat.
Oh, my God.
- I never grew a beard.
- You never grew brains, either.
I tell you, menopause was wonderful for me.
It meant no more PMS.
- I never had PMS.
- Neither did I. But I had a BMW.
A red one.
Charlie bought it for me.
PMS.
Pre-menstrual syndrome, Rose.
You mean, you never got crazy once a month?
- No.
- Boy, I did.
I would cry, scream, carry on, put on 10Ibs of water.
Menopause put an end to that.
I loved it.
How could you love it?
Because I didn't see it as having anything to do with my sexuality.
I am exactly the same as I was.
- Unfortunately.
- Thank you.
Men are so lucky.
They never get periods in the first place.
They never have to go through this.
They blame us for being crazy when we get 'em.
The first time I got my period, nobody had told me anything.
Your mother didn't tell you?
She was very prim and proper.
Oh, what a surprise.
Well, my whole childhood, I kept hearing about the curse.
How when I was 13, I was going to get the curse.
I was absolutely terrified.
The year of my 13th birthday, I slept with the lights on all year.
I was sure there was a witch behind every wisteria.
I didn't go out on Halloween.
But the year went by and no curse.
Then the next year went by, no curse.
Finally, when I was 15, Mama took me to the doctor.
And he said, "Blanche, do you mean you don't have your period"?
I said, "Of course I have my period, you fool.
For almost two years".
"It's the curse I don't have".
I got it, or I didn't get it, nobody told me.
I figured, "This is life," and ate my meatballs.
Then when I stopped, it just happened.
A few hot flashes and that was it.
- I've heard about those.
- They didn't bother me.
In Florida, who can tell a hot flash from a weather front?
Oh, but it's all so depressing.
My cousin didn't get her period for - Ma, that never happened.
- Yes, it did.
Then it must be in the Guinness Book Of Records.
It is.
The Sicilian one.
The Garibaldi Book Of Records.
Ma, no 72-year-old woman ever became pregnant.
So what?
It cheered her up.
She'll cheer up when she realises it makes no difference at all in her life.
It is just a concept.
It is not based on reality.
- No.
It's rained on my parade.
- Oh, Dr Parks, come right in.
- Who is that?
- The vet.
- I don't think you met Blanche.
- No, he has not.
I would have remembered.
Thank you for coming.
A man as brilliant as you must be terribly busy.
The change of life didn't change her life.
Well, it's no mystery.
The minks won't breed because they're too old.
- You're kidding.
- Isn't he brilliant?
Somebody sold you minks that are too old to breed.
They're worn out.
They're not interested.
- You can be too old?
- Rodents can be, not humans.
Is that a theory or is that based on personal experience?
Both.
Doctor, there's a lizard out on the lanai that's looking piqued.
- I wonder if you'd mind taking a look.
- Not at all.
I'm so worried about the poor little thing, I just can't sleep at all.
I'm such a lover of animals.
She could be in a coma.
Put a man within five miles, and she'd shave her legs.
I cannot believe they sold us minks that are too old.
- Who can you trust?
- No one.
I learned that in Sicily.
Works in Miami, too.
Well, we wound up spending $678 in the mink business.
- What did we make?
- Make?
A mistake, Rose.
A very large, expensive mistake.
- Hello.
- Hi.
How did it go?
- Is your lizard still alive?
- He just loved me.
But he would.
I'm sophisticated, worldly, glamorous.
Maybe he's too down to earth, nice and decent, you know what I mean?
- Yes.
- Yes.
Well, I had a good time.
He was very nice.
The best part is, I think I'm over my menopausal depression.
You just needed the confidence to know you're still attractive.
Dr Parks helped do that.
Maybe a little.
I know that beauty like mine cannot fade overnight.
He didn't have that much to do with it.
It was you girls.
You let me go and be crazy and you were right there.
We live here.
You were caring and supportive and I thank you for it.
I'm lucky to have friends like you.
The little rats are still here.
The animal people are coming tomorrow.
- No, they aren't.
- I called.
- I cancelled.
- What do you mean?
We are not giving away Fluffy, Muffy, Buffy and Joanne.
Rose, they are non-breeding minks, who eat their weight in food every day.
Joanne?
Dorothy, this is their home now.
Eat their weight in food every day?
When I'm depressed, so do I. No, Rose, they go.
No, the minks stay.
- They served man, we serve them.
- Come on.
Are you saying that because they're too old to breed, they're useless?
The minks stay.
Right.
Come on.
Let's cook them something to eat.
- Oh, my God.
- What?
- I think they're making - What?
They're making a stole.
Let me see.
Let me see.
- We're back in business.
- Oh, please.
They are, Dorothy.
They really are.
Oh, they certainly are.
But don't count your money yet.
Those are the two males.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Yep.
Yeah.
- Yep.
- Well?
Your infestation profile is threefold.
You have silverfish and water bugs in the drainage areas.
Under the baseboards you have Blattaria andropolis.
Hear that?
The Greek president lives under our baseboard.
Blattaria andropolis is a cockroach.
Maybe he'll be voted out next election.
What do you do to get rid of them?
The next step is to ascertain the condition of your exterior.
I need to perform a cursory inspection of your subterranean substructure.
- Crawl under the house?
- Easy to make it sound stupid.
Poor man, how does he face himself every day knowing his life is devoted to killing living things?
Rose, I don't think a guy who drives around with a fibreglass termite on his van ponders many deep questions.
Blanche, what's the matter?
Oh, girls, I'm just in ecstasy.
My body is tingling all over.
Guess what just happened.
We know what happened.
What part of the Middle East is he from?
I just won the raffle at the movie theatre.
Tickets to the premiere of Burt Reynolds' new movie tomorrow.
- That's nice.
- Yes.
And passes for me and my two best friends to the private party afterwards to be hosted by none other than Mr Burt Reynolds himself.
- Sophia, honey - Oh, no.
Not this time.
I'm tired of being Tonto of the group.
I couldn't get another ticket.
Then this time we'll draw cards.
I missed out on Evita.
Ma, I'm not giving up a chance to meet Burt Reynolds.
- Me neither.
- Et tu, Blanche?
Sophia, Burt Reynolds is one of our finest living actors.
He should have won the Oscar for Deliverance.
Not to mention Starting Over.
That Academy's just jealous.
Put Sir Laurence Olivier in Cannonball Run, see what he can do.
I'm sorry, Sophia, but the answer's no.
Fine.
Break an old lady's heart.
I'll be out back with the rest of the garbage.
Don't worry, she'll get over it.
And even if she doesn't, who cares?
We're gonna meet Burt Reynolds.
I always get this reaction when I wear the tight jumpsuit.
- What did you find?
- Bad news.
You've got termites.
- No.
Can you get rid of 'em?
- Haven't you heard our motto?
- What is it?
- "We get rid of termites".
We'll tent the house.
You'll have to move out for two days.
Where will we stay?
How about a beautiful hotel over on Miami Beach?
We're meeting Burt Reynolds.
Let's make a weekend out of it.
We can't afford a hotel there.
I'll find one we can afford.
What do you say?
- I think it's a terrific idea.
- OK.
You can start tomorrow.
I'm off to find us the perfect hotel for our perfect weekend.
Ma, a hotel on the beach.
Doesn't that sound like fun?
I can go?
I don't get gassed with the termites?
Dorothy, you're such a good daughter.
She'll get over it.
And if she doesn't, who cares?
We're going to meet Burt Reynolds.
You want the bed next to the TV or the window?
The bed next to Burt Reynolds.
Fine, I'll take this one.
- Ma, are you all right?
- Yeah.
Just a little relapse from my pneumonia.
You remember.
I ran six miles in the rain to bring you the cannoli for your lunchbox.
Ma, please.
Don't worry, I'll be all right.
You all go schmooze with Burt and his buddies.
I'll stay here and hack myself unconscious.
That's being a good sport.
Dorothy, you think Burt's gonna like this dress?
Yeah.
That plunging neckline will really show off his chest hair.
The last time I wore this was at the 1972 presidential inauguration.
I danced in the arms of the president.
The next morning I woke up still in his arms.
Blanche.
You and Nixon?
Nixon?
No.
I can't even picture Nixon naked.
He must look like one of those little dress-up dolls.
Little mounds of plastic to indicate where things oughta be.
No, I was talking about Mr William "Buster" Collier.
The president of the Chamber of Commerce.
Oh, that presidential inauguration.
Buster wanted me to be his First Lady - but he died two days later.
- I'm sorry.
He was performing his first official function: Breaking a champagne bottle over the new tollbooth.
But before he could step out of the way, he was run over by ten Shriners on minibikes who just happened to have the exact change.
So many of our great leaders have gone that way.
There's a story in the paper about the party tonight.
- Really?
- Look who's gonna be there.
Dom DeLuise.
Loni Anderson.
Charles Nelson Reilly.
Charles Nelson Reilly.
God.
Who else?
- John Forsythe.
- Mr John Forsythe.
Oh, my God.
He's just the sexiest man in television.
And Burt is the sexiest man in the movies.
I cannot believe this.
All that manliness in one crowded room.
Hot crowded room.
Everybody's steamy bodies all pressed Blanche.
Relax.
You'll set off the smoke detector.
Hello?
This is Rose Nylund.
What?
I'm one of the winners of the Publishers Clearing House?
Ed McMahon wants to see me right away?
Leave my Burt Reynolds ticket on the dresser before I go?
Ma, get off the phone.
Mind your own business.
Guess what.
I think this is Sophia.
Which room's available?
Room 506.
The room is 50, the young lady's 100.
Make it quick.
I'm not running a hotel here.
Girls, don't you just love our hotel?
It's much nicer than those big chains.
How did you find it?
It's in our price range, near the beach and it had the most men in the lobby.
Let's go.
We don't wanna keep Burt waiting.
Wait a minute.
Let's have a quick drink in the bar.
- Oh, Blanche.
- Come on.
It'll be fun.
OK, but let's make it quick.
Miss.
Girls, you see that man over there staring at me?
He's undressing me with his eyes.
- Do you wanna move tables?
- Not yet, he's only half done.
Excuse me, I couldn't help but notice you from across the room.
My friends and I would like to buy you ladies a drink.
Thank you, but we don't have much time.
- This is Carl and this is John.
- We're all from Kenosha.
I know a John from Kenosha.
I'll bet you know a lot of Johns.
That's a good one.
It must be regional humour.
- We're at the clothing show.
- Oh, is leather big this year?
It is with Carl.
Yeah.
As long as I don't have to pay extra.
Even I don't get that one.
What's your name?
Blanche.
These are my friends Rose and Dorothy.
So, how long have you girls been working?
That's an odd lead-off question, Carl.
But actually I've been working about 30 years.
You must really know your business.
Dorothy's a very experienced teacher.
Everybody who's had her says she's great.
Let's get some drinks, go upstairs and have Dorothy teach us the three Rs.
Reading, writing, running around the bed.
As enticing as the offer is, we really must pass.
If you don't wanna party, there are younger girls that'll take our money.
Girls who'll take their money.
You know what he thinks we are?
Waitresses?
No, Rose.
Hookers.
God, that must mean everybody here is Everybody is under arrest.
It's a raid.
All right, everybody stay right where they are.
The wagons will be here momentarily to transport all of you downtown.
Downtown?
He means jail.
Oh, really, Rose.
I thought he meant Neiman Marcus.
I've never been in jail.
I won't make it.
They always prey on the weak and innocent.
They'll taunt me for trying to excel at my work in the laundry.
I'll fall in with a bad crowd whose leader looks like Ethel Merman.
I'll be forced to engineer a prison break using my laundry cart.
From that time on I won't know a moment's peace.
I'll scar my fingerprints with battery acid and run from town to town taking jobs that people have who got bad grades.
Then one day they'll find me, holed up in a shack in the Louisiana bayou.
A sheriff named Bull will call my name over a megaphone.
When I run, he'll riddle my body with bullets.
Please don't let them take me downtown.
I wanna live.
You're not good in a crisis, are you, Rose?
Dorothy, what are we gonna do?
We'll have to explain that this is all a terrible mistake.
Officer.
What can I do for the senior statesman of the group?
I'll let that pass because you have the upper hand.
My friends and I are totally innocent.
- I'm innocent too.
- Me too.
Quiet, you trash.
Go on, Dorothy.
Officer, if I could see you for just a moment, I'm sure we could settle this matter to your satisfaction.
Forget it.
I happen to be a married man.
All of you downtown.
We're moving now.
Officer, you don't understand.
We were on our way to see Burt Reynolds.
Don't you dare drag Burt's good name into this.
Move.
Move, all of you.
Let's go.
Move it.
Come on.
Come on.
I cannot believe it.
Arrested.
- I've never been in jail in my life.
- Relax, honey.
With the notches you must have on your garter belt it was bound to happen.
Oh, Rose.
Rose, honey.
Are you all right?
I was booked.
Fingerprints, mug shots.
I'm a known criminal.
I can't go back to my home town.
- Nobody's ever gonna find out.
- Oh, yes, they will.
The St Olaf Courier Dispatch is known for its investigative reporting.
You're right.
That series they did on oat fungus was an uncompromising piece of journalism.
Damn.
I bet you Burt is greeting his guests right now.
I can't believe we're gonna miss it.
I won't accept it.
Excuse me.
Officer.
A grievous injustice has been perpetrated against my friends and me.
We are totally innocent.
We're just three helpless females, desperately in need of a big strong strapping man like yourself.
What cute earrings.
Did you really think you could get us out by flirting with that guard?
- Yes, if he'd been a man.
- Sure.
It's always a man with you.
Men and sex, sex and men.
There's nothing wrong with being career-oriented.
It's your overactive sex drive that got us into this mess.
Who picks a hotel because of all the men?
Just get off my back.
You think I'm happy about being arrested?
You think I'm happy about missing Burt Reynolds or about being locked up with this gutter trash?
What did you just say?
What cute earrings.
Nobody calls me names.
Come on, I'll let you have the first punch.
Punch?
Heavens.
Fight, fight.
You cut that out right now.
I'm gonna tear you apart.
Listen, you punk.
You wanna fight, you'll have to fight me.
But I warn you, I did time in Attica.
Attica's a men's prison.
I know.
I was there a year before they found out.
Sorry, chief.
I didn't mean to ruffle your feathers.
Oh, Dorothy.
That was magnificent.
How did you ever pull that off?
I work in the public school system.
It's not that different.
Oh, Blanche.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
I apologise.
Don't you worry.
We're all on edge.
This is the biggest disappointment of my life.
Yes.
And I've known some real disappointment, believe me.
You're not gonna tell us that story about the exploding pig again, are you?
I never told you a story about an exploding pig, Dorothy.
It was a peg-legged pig.
Our possum was the one that exploded.
Forgive me, Rose.
With so many possum explosions, it's hard to keep track.
So what was this great disappointment in your life?
Butter.
I wanted to be Butter Queen.
What an actress.
She was so good in Gone With The Wind.
I wanted to be Miss Olivia de Havilland myself.
- Blanche, are you listening?
- Bits and pieces.
Go on, Rose.
Butter Queen was our town's highest honour.
From the time I was born my folks groomed me for it.
Singing lessons, dancing lessons, junior butter pageants.
For 16 years my entire life revolved around butter.
You were very fortunate.
So many of us wasted our youth.
When the time came for the pageant, I was incredible.
I showed poise in the evening-gown competition.
I was brilliant in the oral butter quiz.
They couldn't even trip me up with a trick margarine question.
That evening butter was spelt R-O-S-E.
Rose, you're embarrassing yourself.
Please don't go on.
I have to.
I've kept these bitter butter memories too long.
As the pageant drew to its frenzied finale, there I was, alongside the other two finalists, churning my guts out.
When all of a sudden, for no apparent reason, my churn jammed.
- Oh, no.
- Yes.
And just like that, it was over.
I'd lost.
It was the biggest disappointment in my life.
It was small consolation to find out, years later, there had been churn-tampering involved.
Blanche.
Rose, we're going to the other end of the cell.
Don't cross this line.
Did I hear you say that you were from St Olaf?
- Yes.
- I'm from St Gustaf.
We're neighbours.
My name's Meg.
I'm Rose.
What are you doing here, Meg?
I was arrested for being a hooker, like you.
I'm not a hooker.
I was arrested by mistake.
That's what I always tell the judge, too.
How did you get mixed up in this?
I don't know.
Things were bad at home.
I ended up in Miami.
It just happened.
Nothing could be bad enough at home for you to end up doing what you're doing.
I don't need a lecture.
But you can't be happy with your life.
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- If you ever wanna talk, you know, neighbour to neighbour, I'm here.
Ma, thank God you're here.
Arrested for prostitution.
I can't believe it.
Sophia.
Sophia, we're innocent.
How can these cops think anyone would pay to sleep with you?
Sophia, did you come to bail us out?
No, Rose, she's dropping off a manicotti with a file in it.
We're gonna see Burt after all.
I thought these tickets were gonna go to waste.
Which one of you isn't going?
I'm the one who won the tickets.
It's my mom who's bailing us out.
I lost Butter Queen.
Haven't I suffered enough?
- We'll draw straws.
- No.
- We'll flip a coin.
- No.
Sophia, now try and be understanding.
Understanding?
I came to bail you out and you won't let me go?
Ma, stop complaining and get us out of here.
Where are your roommates?
- They're not here.
- Ma.
Don't "Ma" me, you cheap floozy.
Ma, you would do this to your own flesh and blood?
You'll get over it.
If you don't, who cares?
I'm off to see Burt Reynolds.
And then, you're gonna love this, Dom DeLuise insists I tell Burt the story.
Sophia, I don't wanna hear any more.
Not even the part where Burt and Dom insisted I tell it to Loni?
That's it.
I don't wanna hear another word.
Cinderella's back from the ball and her wicked roommates are jealous.
We are not jealous, Ma.
We are angry.
You left us in jail.
I sent bail money.
You were out an hour later.
That was the time I was nibbling a giant shrimp out of Jerry Reed's hand.
You're making this up just to rub it in.
You have never met these people.
Jealousy is a very ugly thing, Dorothy.
And so are you in anything backless.
Last night was a bigger disappointment than losing Butter Queen.
- Do you wanna know why?
- No.
Meg.
Come in.
I can't, my taxi's waiting.
I just wanted to stop by and say thank you.
- For what?
- For convincing me to go home.
I figured I'd give it another try.
Oh, that's great.
What was it I said?
Nothing.
I didn't wanna be your age and still be in the business.
Well, good luck.
I've never felt so good and so cheap in my whole life.
At least something good came out of that horrible night.
- Sophia around?
- Hi, Burt.
- How about a little lunch?
- How about a big lunch?
My God.
You're Mr Burt Reynolds.
I hope so, otherwise I got the wrong underwear on.
- These your roommates?
- Yeah.
- Which one's the slut?
- I am.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
14.
Here's what I figure your take would be for the first month.
So what do you say?
Partners?
Making extra money appeals to me but why the sandwich business?
Because we don't have enough counter space to make kidney machines.
- So are we partners or what?
- It sounds kinda complicated.
Selling sandwiches at a construction site?
I don't know about business.
Ask Dorothy.
Or Blanche.
- At least they'd have some input.
- I know.
So are we partners?
How do I look?
Nice.
Now put some make-up on.
- Ma, I'm wearing make-up.
- Then eat by candlelight.
You look lovely, you really do.
She's got a date with Geoffrey the commodore.
He's a commodore?
In the navy?
No, Rose, the singing group.
In the middle.
He was on the end till Lionel Richie left.
You've been spending a lot of time together.
Oh, yes.
Just when I'd given up hope of meeting someone, along came the most gallant, sophisticated, charming man I've met in ages.
I bet he can tie a lot of neat knots.
- Dorothy, guess who's here?
- My date.
- Your husband.
- I don't have one.
Call the police.
- Your ex-husband.
- I'll call the police.
Hi, everyone.
It's me, Stan.
Dorothy, in the future I would appreciate advance notice when you're expecting a gentleman.
This time it's only Stan but next time it could be somebody appealing or charming or good-Iooking.
- No offence, Stan.
- None taken.
- Could we talk for a minute?
- Of course.
Come on.
Is your wife here or is she at home cleaning out her toy box?
Ma, I told you.
Stan and Chrissie got a divorce.
I thought you said they got a horse.
I'm 80.
You gotta enunciate.
Don't get me wrong.
Horse, divorce, I could care less.
I just hate being left with egg on my face.
Alright, Stan, what's wrong?
- Why should something be wrong?
- We were married for 38 years.
You can disguise your bald head but you can't hide your emotions.
- Now, what's wrong?
- I lost it, Dorothy.
You never had it, Stanley.
The business.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
flushed down the toilet like a snotty ball of Kleenex.
You could always write poetry for a living.
I'm sorry.
I know how devastated you must be.
- I have one question, though.
- I can manage the alimony.
That was not my question.
Could we possibly discuss this tomorrow?
- I have plans to go out.
- Dorothy, please I'm afraid to be alone tonight.
My world is crumbling.
I don't know what I might do.
You'll watch an old Barnaby Jones, eat a half-gallon of rum raisin, throw up and fall asleep in your kimono.
See, Dorothy, nobody knows me like you.
Look, I really have plans.
I made dinner reservations at Monty's.
We could take a walk on the beach, go dancing at the Breakers, if there's no cover charge.
- I really can't.
- Dorothy, please.
Say yes.
I need a shoulder to cry on.
Oh, alright.
Give me a minute.
Girls, I need a shoulder to cry on.
- What did that creep do?
- It's not for me, it's Stan.
He lost the business.
He has to take his mind off it.
- What do you want us to do?
- Go out with him.
What?
I feel terrible but I'm not about to cancel my date.
- So I have to cancel mine.
- You don't have one.
Nobody knows that.
I'd do it, but I'm really no good at listening to people's problems.
Rose, you're a grief counsellor.
It's what you do.
I know but I have the highest suicide rate in the office.
Rose, if you don't want to go out with Stan, just say so.
I don't want to.
Oh, honey, I know going out with Stan is big favour.
The biggest.
You're asking me to spend my evening with a man you describe as having the personality of a dial tone.
And why?
So you can have a splendid evening with a dashing naval officer.
Absolutely not.
Under no circumstances will I entertain the notion.
I'll let you borrow my cashmere sweater.
- No.
- I'll give you outright my practically full bottle of Chanel No.
5.
- Perfume or cologne?
- Cologne.
- Forget it.
- I'll introduce you to all of Geoffrey's naval officer friends.
Some of them have been at sea for over six months.
Make yourself comfortable.
I'll be with you in two minutes.
Use these potatoes.
We're out of tomatoes.
- I don't think this'll work.
- We just say it fast.
Bacon lettuce and potato.
Bacon lettuce and potato.
Hey, what are you two doing up?
- It's after midnight.
- We're going into business.
How did she talk you into this?
Sophia didn't talk me into it.
As she said, if I had half a brain, I'd have thought of it myself.
Besides, it'll be fun, Dorothy.
Just like when I was little and sold Belgian waffles alongside the road.
You had a Belgian waffle stand?
Well, actually they were English muffins that I carved ridges in.
But people bought 'em anyway.
I was cute so I got away with it.
You get cute again at 80.
That's how I'll peddle this slop.
- How was your date?
- Glorious.
Geoffrey is a dream.
It was even worth the guilt I felt over Blanche.
Is she speaking to me?
- She's not home yet.
- Poor Blanche.
When Stan is depressed, he is the second most boring man in the world.
- Who's the first?
- Stan when he's not depressed.
This is the most bizarre evening I've ever spent with a man.
Including the time with the Nicaraguan Jai-Alai team?
She said one man.
That was the most bizarre evening she spent with a team.
Are those sandwiches?
I am starving.
They're bacon lettuce and potato.
Potato?
Work on it, Rose.
Remember, you're not cute any more.
I thought Stan took you to dinner.
- He did.
- Let me guess.
You were on your way to a candlelit dinner at Monty's when Stan spotted a charming little Pakistani restaurant.
Indian.
Cocktails consisted of warm beer in two different shaped glasses.
He ordered, would not let you see the menu, and when he paid, he got change from a ten.
- A five.
- Dorothy, that's amazing.
Try me now.
I'll think about what I had for dinner.
I'm not psychic.
I just know Stan's idea of a night out.
You know, actually, it wasn't so bad.
I kind of enjoyed myself.
I didn't have to impress him and he knew he couldn't impress me so we just kind of had fun.
We're doing it again tomorrow.
- What?
- Well, unless you mind.
I should have asked you first.
I'll cancel.
Don't be ridiculous.
Why should I object?
- He was your husband.
- Was.
We're divorced, remember?
He left me for a woman half Blanche's age.
It's wonderful you're going out with Stan again.
Geoff and I are going to a formal dinner at the base.
He looks so dashing in his dress uniform.
Dorothy went out with a commodore, Blanche went out with Stan, I spent the evening making bacon, lettuce and potato sandwiches.
Step on it.
The sun's coming up.
Why do we leave so early?
We don't want a crummy location.
Shouldn't we have dry ice to keep these cold?
We should charge them for a hot lunch.
- What are you two doing up?
- Go back to bed.
It's 5:30.
It's a little early to be selling lunch.
We wanted to get the best corner before Johnny No-Thumbs shows up.
Johnny No-Thumbs?
Actually, he has several fingers missing from each hand.
It's remarkable to watch him make a veal and pepper hero.
Ma, you are trying to muscle in on a guy named Johnny No-Thumbs?
He's probably connected with the Mob.
If they were friends, he'd still have thumbs.
He's a very sweet man.
But the first time he waved hello, Sophia misunderstood and gave him the finger back.
Why don't you get some more sleep?
- I can't sleep.
I'm too upset.
- What's wrong?
I won't be seeing Geoffrey anymore.
He's leaving.
I knew it.
The minute I heard you were dating a sailor, I said to myself there'll be nothing but heartaches.
Those swabbies drift into port, park their diddies on your doorstep, show you some tricks they learnt in the Orient and then it's, "Avast, me hearties," and they shove off with a serpent tattoo and your heart as souvenirs.
You've been reading Treasure Island again, Rose.
I know this from my ancestors.
The Vikings were a seafaring people, you know.
They also wore horns on their head and metal brassieres.
This is not the same.
- So he dumped you?
- He did not dump me.
He's being transferred to the Aleutian Islands.
He's going to a secret base where he can't have contact with the outside world.
- He dumped you.
- Yes.
- Dorothy, I'm sorry.
- Why, whenever I think I've met Mr Right, am I wrong?
Because, Dorothy, you're not the most perceptive woman in the world.
What's everybody doing up?
I thought you'd still be asleep.
We thought you were.
Where were you?
With Stan.
I'll tell you all about it in the morning.
- This is the morning.
- Why, so it is.
So it is.
- Six cakes of soap - Dorothy, please speak to me.
- One can of cleanser - No cleanser until you talk to me.
If you won't talk, how can I understand why you're angry with me?
- Just a walk along the beach.
- What about it?
When you come back from a walk along the beach you spend an hour shaking the sand out of your underalls.
What do you mean?
Blanche Devereaux does not stay out all night with a man just to walk along the beach.
Never before, that's true.
But as Beauregard Jefferson pointed out when I was 16, there's a first time for everything.
Last night was the first time you slept with Stan.
- That's a lie.
- So it was not the first time.
Oh, Dorothy.
Dorothy.
Get out of my way, you old fool.
Why won't you believe me?
And why does it matter?
You don't even like Stan anymore.
You begged me to go out with him to get him off your back.
Now you're angry cos I didn't have a terrible time?
Why do you care?
I just know I'm terribly upset because I'm letting this get me terribly upset.
- Blanche, I'm sorry.
- That's alright.
You've been dumped by the man of your dreams.
It's not surprising you're a little irritable.
But to be upset about Stan.
I'm so embarrassed.
It's not as if he means anything to me.
Honey, I know exactly what you're going through, believe me.
I'm just so glad we had this little talk.
If we hadn't, I'd feel strange about going out with Stan again tonight.
You're going out with Stan tonight?
He has tickets to the Burt Reynolds Dinner Theatre.
- And you're going?
- Of course I am.
I'm not missing Mr Jamie Farr in the Caine Mutiny Court Martial.
I hurt my back.
I'm paralysed.
Oh, it's you.
Look where you're going.
We're almost through with our half of the list.
Rose, I want to double the number of sandwiches.
Grab some foil.
You're still gonna sell lunches after Johnny No-Thumbs leaned on you again?
No, Blanche, he said he had friends who would lean on us.
Well, I got friends, too.
One phone call to Palermo and Johnny's lunch wagon will have concrete tires.
Ma, the only person you know in Palermo is Uncle Vito and he's a harmless old man.
Give him some piano wire, make fun of his limp and see what happens.
Do you think they're really gonna make any money?
- One fabric softener - Now what's the matter?
I'll tell you what's the matter.
I cannot believe you're going out with Stan again.
- Why shouldn't I?
- You're right.
My mistake.
- I thought you were my friend.
- I am.
Then why are you sleeping with my husband?
What are y'all looking at?
Get back to your LeSueur Peas.
Dorothy, I promise, there's nothing between us.
Then you will not go out with him tonight.
Isn't that right?
We're only going to see a play.
And he's her ex-husband.
Why am I even explaining this to you?
Why am I explaining this to anybody?
- Who's Lenny?
- Tall, red hair Ioves tuna on wholewheat.
Why do we have his IOU for two bucks?
He only had a hundred and we didn't have change.
- What about these?
- They all had hundreds, too.
Rose, let me give you a few lessons in economics.
Lesson number one: Quit being an idiot.
OK.
Lesson number two: The law of supply and demand.
Before you supply sandwiches, demand the money.
OK.
Lesson number three: Quit being an idiot.
Oh.
I thought you were Blanche.
Once I thought I was Bess Truman but then they switched me to 20mg a day.
My cousin thought he was Jiminy Cricket.
It was just after Pinocchio came out and everyone at the bank went along with it.
And I wondered how you two got together.
- Call me when Blanche gets in.
- Are you two talking again?
Just to give her a piece of my mind.
Is she upset cos she thinks Blanche is sleeping with Stan?
Could be.
Or is it because she thinks she's lying?
- That's a good one, too.
- Don't you care?
Of course.
You think I have no feelings?
I'll tell you a story.
Picture this.
A crowded Mediterranean port, teeming with your tired, your poor, your hungry.
You know, your huddled masses yearning to be free.
We boarded the ship and set sail for America.
singing, laughing, drinking.
Actually, only the Irish were drinking.
But I digress.
Of course, on the second day, things took a turn for the worse.
For the next month and a half, the storm-tossed seas made our lives a living hell.
If I wasn't fighting for a blanket, I was fighting for food.
If I wasn't fighting for food, I was fighting for shuffleboard equipment.
I just threw that in to see if you were paying attention.
Anyway, the storm broke, and through the mist I saw the beautiful lady I'd been longing to see for months.
- The Statue of Liberty.
- No, my mother.
That's how dense the fog was.
But beyond her was the Statue of Liberty.
I remember the first words I shouted.
"There she is.
Lady Liberty".
And I remember the second words I shouted.
"Slow down, you yutz, you're going past her".
But he didn't hear.
And that's why today, Rose, there's an unusually large Italian population in Spilsbury, Massachusetts.
That's a really moving story, Sophia, but what exactly is the point?
The point is, you forgot lessons one and three.
Quit being an idiot.
I stole 40 bucks while you were listening to that cockamamie story.
- She's not back yet?
- No.
I don't understand.
What could they be doing?
- You know what.
- I also know Stan.
We were married for 38 years.
And if you added up all the times that we did what he is doing right now, Blanche still should have been home Where are you going?
To get ice cream or commit a felony.
I'll decide in the car.
- Yes?
- I'm Vinnie.
This is Rocco.
Johnny No-Thumbs sent us.
Sophia, it's for you.
- Who is it?
- Dorothy.
Dorothy.
Stay under the covers.
I'll get rid of her.
- It's late.
What do you want?
- Open the door, Stanley.
You're in your nightgown.
I came on an impulse.
I couldn't help it.
It's a nice gesture, babe, but I'll have to take a rain check.
Stanley, you truly are one chromosome away from being a potato.
I gotta get up early tomorrow.
I need to get to sleep.
You're wearing your toupee to bed.
That means one of two things.
There's a woman in there or Suzanne Sommers is on the Tonight Show.
Would you get to your point, Dorothy?
I came here to talk to her.
It'll just take a minute then you can get back to it.
Thank you.
I have been trying to figure out why you're doing this.
Trying to find one reason that would make it OK, but I can't.
I cannot believe that you would jeopardise our relationship for this.
I guess it's possible you were attracted to Stan.
I stayed with him for 38 years.
But I think this time you could have resisted just in case it might have made a difference to me.
The thing that hurts most of all is that you didn't have the guts to tell me that you're sleeping with my husband.
Well, gee, I would have.
But I didn't know myself until about an hour ago.
Hey, what's all this?
Aren't they beautiful?
- Johnny No-Thumbs sent them.
- He sent you flowers?
You remember harmless old Uncle Vito?
He sent a note to Johnny No-Thumbs.
He addressed it to Johnny No-Knees.
He got the message, we got the flowers.
Come on, Ma.
And Rose and I are getting out of sandwiches.
The profits weren't quite what we expected.
- Is Blanche back yet?
- In the living room.
Thanks.
Blanche, I want to apologise.
OK.
- I apologise.
- That's it?
I can't think of anything else to say.
I behaved terribly.
- I know.
- No, you don't.
I went to Stan's hotel room because I thought you were there.
- Well, I wasn't.
- I know.
I told him that I couldn't see him anymore.
- I've been such a creep.
- I know.
I wish I could explain it but I can't.
I think some of it may be that I didn't want to share my memories.
That part of my life, with Stan, is over, but I still wanted it to be just mine.
I was afraid that you might take that part away and And I was feeling jealous and Ionely and - God knows what else.
- Magenta.
- Excuse me?
- Magenta.
That's what I call it.
All kinds of feelings tumbling all over themselves.
You're not quite blue because you're not really sad and although you're jealous, you're not green with envy and every now and then you realise you're kinda scared but you'd hardly call yourself yellow.
I hate that feeling, and I hate the colour magenta.
That's why I named it that.
Magenta.
No way to really explain it but, fortunately, between friends, you don't have to.
Oh, Dorothy.
Dorothy.
Listen, now that we're talking to each other, can I ask a question?
Why in hell did you ever marry Stan?
It was my magenta period.
And, you know, Stan was rather handsome when he had hair.
- Come on.
- He had a certain - elegant charm.
- Oh, please.
And, of course, I was four months pregnant.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Hi, Ma.
How did you do?
- I got 35 people to sign up.
- That's great.
Wait, Ma, three of these people are dead.
Who are they gonna tell?
- Hi.
- Hi, Blanche.
There you go.
You've been gone three hours and you only got one guy to sign?
Give me a chance to freshen up.
I'll get you another one.
Girls.
I've got some bad news.
I couldn't get Mrs Claxton to sign the petition.
That tree's on her property.
If she doesn't sign, the city will chop the tree down.
It doesn't make sense.
Why would she wanna cut down that 200-year-old oak?
Because Frieda Claxton is a miserable, vile, scum-sucking crank who gives nice old ladies like me a bad name.
Believe me, she's a totally rotten human being.
There is no such a thing as a rotten human being.
There's good in everybody.
I agree with Sophia.
Mrs Claxton is a mean old woman.
- All the neighbours hate her.
- Don't say that.
Come on.
Last Halloween, half the kids in the neighbourhood wore Frieda Claxton costumes.
Maybe she just needs to be shown some kindness, like a fellow I knew back home.
Ernest Minky.
I'm suddenly so hungry.
I'll get some food.
Boy, that was a close call.
One more story about the colourful people from St Olaf, and I'll explode.
- He was St Olaf's librarian.
- Kaboom.
He was also our town's only dentist.
His office was in the library.
He did both jobs at the same time.
Everyone hated Minky.
He seemed to enjoy giving other people pain.
They hated him so much, nobody ever went to the dentist or the library.
In 1938, you could tell if someone was from St Olaf.
They were illiterate and they had teeth that looked like Indian corn.
Thank you, Rose.
That was a wonderful story.
I'm only half done.
I passed a kidney stone once that was less painful than this.
One summer, I worked up enough nerve to check out the latest Nancy Drew mystery and Mr Minky was stamping my book and his tie caught in the stamping machine.
He'd have died, if I hadn't cut his tie with my Girl Scout knife.
He was so grateful, he checked my book out for a week.
- What's so special about that?
- Usually it was for an hour.
Mr Minky always said, "Books belong in a library".
Really?
'Cause I always thought Churchill said that at Yalta.
The point is, some people seem mean but just need a little kindness.
And some people, like old lady Claxton, are just plain rotten.
I'm gonna prove you all wrong.
There is a week left before the commissioners' meeting.
I'll be as nice as I can.
I bet, by then, she'll be as anxious to save that tree as us.
Hello, Mrs Claxton?
This is Rose Nylund.
How are you?
I've never sat on one before, but wouldn't that be painful?
Sophia, Forget it.
We can't do that.
- Why not?
- Because stapling a $20 bill to the petition is illegal.
It's bribery.
Don't say that's how you got things done in Sicily.
That's not how we got things done in Sicily.
Bribery was how we got things done in New York.
In Sicily, you cut off a horse's head and put it in somebody's bed.
- Sophia, you're making that up.
- Like hell.
Our garbage commissioner, Fredo Lombardy, went on strike once.
He woke up the next morning sharing a pillow with National Velvet.
At 7.00am, he was out cleaning the street with his tongue.
Sophia, we live in the greatest country in the world.
A country founded on the principles of honesty, truth and fairness.
I'm certain that, once we present our petition, the democratic system will prevail.
And our noble effort to save that mighty oak will prove victorious.
- You certainly sound pretty confident.
- She slept with two commissioners.
That works in Sicily and New York.
Girls, I've got great news.
I've just come from Mrs Claxton's and she says she wants to save the tree.
- You're kidding.
- How did you manage that?
Persistence.
I have gone to her house every day with home-made Danish, begging her.
She didn't want the apricot nor the cheese, but the prune did the trick.
Always does for me.
After she snarfed down two, she said she'd save the tree.
Speak of the devil, here's the miserable witch.
Sophia Mrs Claxton, how lovely to see you again.
Who are you?
Your neighbour, Blanche Devereaux.
Yeah.
I didn't recognise you with your clothes on.
I beg your pardon?
With my binoculars, I have a terrific view in your bedroom window.
Some of the stuff you do must be illegal.
I'm looking into it.
Why, you miserable old Let's try to get along.
Mrs Claxton, I don't know if you remember me.
Dorothy Zbornak.
Sure.
You're the one with nothing going on in your bedroom.
- Why, you miserable old - Dorothy.
Mrs Claxton, we want you to know we all appreciate you helping us to save the tree.
I'm not.
I'm here to make sure they tear it down.
I hate trees.
And people.
Rose told us you said you would help us.
- That's right.
- Now you're not?
- Why did you lie?
- To get the Danish.
Look, there's nothing I hate more than someone who thinks everyone who lives alone wants company and a few kind words.
I live alone because I like it.
I've no use for people.
Never have.
See you inside.
- Where are you going?
- To throw holy water on her.
If her head spins around, we're in big trouble.
It is the consensus of the committee that the promoters' petition for the outdoor concert be denied.
Next on the agenda is the proposal to widen Richmond Street.
Will the representative of those wanting to block this step forward?
- Wish me luck.
- Wait.
Why should you do it?
Because we'll have a better chance.
I happen to be a wonderful orator.
Two of the commissioners can verify that.
Blanche, "orator" means "speaker".
Really?
Somebody else do the talking.
- Ladies, we're waiting.
- Let me save everyone time.
My name is Frieda Claxton.
The tree is on my property and I don't care if the city wants to cut it down.
they've all signed to save the tree.
Concrete's cleaner.
- They'll get used to it.
- Mrs Claxton, please.
I have pictures of it to show you.
You wanna look at pictures?
I've got pictures.
Of her roommate, the human slinky.
Shut up, Claxton.
Were there any other faces recognisable in those pictures?
You shut up too, Ed.
Stop wasting the taxpayers' money.
Yank out that tree and start pouring cement.
Mrs Claxton, think about what you're doing.
That beautiful old tree is 200 years old.
How can you hate a living thing?
I hate you.
That's it.
I have had all I'm gonna take from you.
If you don't have the common decency to treat people like human beings, then I'm not gonna waste my time kissing your fanny.
If you don't like it, Mrs Claxton, you sit there and shut up while we have our say.
If you don't like it, drop dead.
Go on, Dorothy.
- What happened?
- You know you said, "Drop dead"?
- Yes.
- I think she did.
Why do people die, Dorothy?
Rose, please.
I don't even know why fools fall in love.
I killed her.
I might as well have shot her with a gun.
Honey, the woman was 83.
She had a heart attack.
It was coincidence.
You haven't slept for two days.
Stop torturing yourself.
I guess you're right.
- Rose, you can't sleep again?
- No.
Rose, you have to put this behind you.
You killed Mrs Claxton two days ago.
Blanche.
I mean she died two days ago.
Rose knows she didn't do anything.
She's just upset.
Go to her funeral, have a good cry.
You'll feel better.
There won't be a funeral.
Mrs Claxton didn't have any friends or relatives.
She'll be buried in an unmarked grave in a potter's field.
That's too bad.
Is there any more cheesecake?
Blanche, how can you be so callous?
Sorry, but I won't pretend to be in mourning.
Mrs Claxton worked overtime at being a nasty woman.
Blanche is right.
That's why nobody wants to go to her funeral.
How would you feel if you dropped dead and nobody showed up at your funeral?
It's probably a personal thing, but for me, I think dropping dead would be the bigger disappointment.
There'll be tons of people at mine.
How can you be sure?
I was at my funeral at 16.
I saw it all.
What?
My hormones were racing, my body was blossoming.
I had urges and yearnings so strong.
Sometimes I'd wake up in the night, sweating and screaming and clawing, like a trapped panther.
Unable to release the lusty, steamy passions that constantly threatened to erupt from within me.
When I was 16, I had acne and played the accordion in a marching band.
Nothing seemed to go right that year.
But the final indignity occurred during the Miss Magnolia Blossom Pageant.
Instead of awarding me the crown as the most beautiful girl in the county, they made me runner-up.
And awarded me Miss Congeniality instead.
At that moment, I vowed to make that town pay for valuing my personality over my perfect body.
I hear Vanna White has the same problem.
I decided to kill myself to teach that town a lesson.
I phonied-up my death in a riverboat accident.
I had the captain, who I was seeing after school, help me.
Everything went perfectly.
The town had never seen a funeral like mine.
Hundreds of people, beautiful eulogies.
Then, just as the minister was getting everybody in a frenzy of grieving, I rushed out and said, "Yoo-hoo.
It's me, Blanche.
I'm not really dead".
The next thing I knew, my daddy was horse-whipping that riverboat captain and dragging me off to a religious girls' school in Atlanta.
My daddy didn't get angry, but when he was, he was a real peckerwood.
What's everybody talking about?
I can honestly say I have no idea.
We started out talking about Mrs Claxton's funeral.
But somewhere along the way, we segued into Blanche, The Miniseries.
When's her funeral?
I wanna pay my respects.
- But I thought you hated her.
- I did.
You go to a funeral to show the man upstairs your respect for human life, no matter how wretched.
Any idiot knows that.
- I knew that.
- See?
Mrs Claxton won't have a funeral.
She had no friends and no relatives.
- We'll pop for her funeral.
- Why?
To show the man upstairs that we have some regard for human life.
No, it's a Sicilian custom.
It's good luck to bury somebody you hate.
You're not fooling me.
You feel bad because Mrs Claxton didn't have anybody.
Maybe I do.
What's it to you?
- You're right.
I'll chip in.
- Sophia, count me in, too.
Sophia, I think you're a wonderful person.
It's a lovely idea to share Mrs Claxton's funeral expenses equally.
I figure your share should be half.
After all, you're the one who killed her.
- Let's get this over with.
- Try to calm down.
Funeral homes give me the willies.
That's why I've avoided them.
I've only been to two funerals and I'm 45.
You're such a liar.
Alright, then, three funerals.
The point is, let's hurry up and go.
- Hello.
- I'm alright, I'm fine.
Excuse her.
Funeral homes make her nervous.
They used to make me nervous, too.
At funeral homes, all they talk about is caskets and burials.
At Forever Peaceful, we've got rid of all that death stuff.
Are you running a sushi bar?
Come this way.
This is our slumber chamber.
And here's my card.
How may I be of service to you?
- Mr Pfeiffer.
- That's Pfeiffer, no silent P. Mr Pfeiffer.
We're interested in arranging a funeral.
Isn't that lovely?
The three of you planning for Mother.
Pfeiffer, how would you like a punch in your p-face?
The funeral is for a neighbour.
- My condolences.
- No need.
We didn't like her.
The whole neighbourhood despised her.
- How did she pass on?
- She killed her.
Rough neighbourhood.
Look, Mr Pfeiffer About the p-funeral.
About the About the funeral arrangements, we'd like something simple, - tasteful, yet incredibly cheap.
OK.
Let's get down to brass handles.
Ladies, I'd like to present to you the winner of the 1985 Casket Design Award.
Paris has been talking about it.
- It's the Omega 3,000.
- How much?
That top is hand-embellished gold-leaf detail work.
The satin interior is imported from a textile mill outside Gstaad.
- How much?
- It's also lead-lined We're not burying Superman.
How much?
- $6,000.
- My first house cost less.
Mr Pfeiffer, we have already told you we are bereaved on a budget.
Now, if you can't accommodate us, we'll find someone who can.
You know, the Avanti Supreme is a big seller.
- That retails for just $3,000.
- What's this one?
- A pine box.
- How much?
- $200.
- Sold.
When would you like the services?
- I don't know.
- Thursday night?
- Thursday night.
- Not Thursday.
Hell, no.
I'm sorry, I forgot.
The Cosby Show.
- How about Friday?
- You have a TV guide?
- Friday will be fine.
- Thank you.
As long as you're here, have you thought about your own final farewell?
I intend to go out with a bang.
And she means that.
My God, this is terrible.
Such a tragedy, such a tragedy.
Ma, try not to upset yourself.
Two men on, the bottom of the ninth.
That botcher hasn't bunked.
Give me that.
I'm tired of sitting here.
Let's go.
I can't believe it.
There was an announcement in the paper.
Her friends must have realised she died.
Why didn't they come?
They were too busy celebrating.
You go ahead, I just wanna sit here a while longer.
I hope I'm not too late for the funeral.
Why, no.
- No, not at all.
- Thank goodness.
I'd have felt terrible if I'd missed it.
She was one of my dearest friends.
Hear that?
One of her dearest friends.
Yes.
Oh, my.
We've been friends for nearly 60 years.
Would you mind saying a few words?
Me?
Mind?
I'd be happy to.
Up here?
Today is a day of great sadness.
Not only for me, but also for the people whose lives have been touched by the warmth and the kindness of this woman who is lying here.
I wish I knew how many charities and hospitals and orphanages have benefited from her generosity.
But now, no-one will ever know.
Because she preferred to do all of her good work anonymously.
I'm sure a lot of people never even knew that she worked for 15 years in a leper colony.
Yes, Celia Rubinstein loved all mankind.
- She was - Who?
Celia Rubinstein.
This funeral isn't for Celia Rubinstein.
It's for Frieda Claxton.
The Rubinstein funeral's down the hall.
I'm so sorry for the intrusion.
Frieda Claxton?
Didn't she own that old house on Richmond Street?
Yes.
You were all right.
Frieda Claxton didn't have a friend in the world.
She didn't make any difference to anybody.
She might as well never even have existed.
- Rose, honey.
- Let her be by herself.
This has been a hell of a night.
I'm glad it's over.
At least we've done the right thing.
Mrs Claxton is in somebody else's hands now.
I'm afraid for the moment she's in mine.
- What?
- There was a mix-up out back.
Mrs Claxton was cremated by mistake.
We never should have hired a high-school student.
Whatever.
Ladies.
You're forgetting something.
Mrs Claxton.
We can't keep her.
- Morning, Blanche.
- I wanna ask you something.
Last night, at two in the morning, did you hear shrieking and screaming?
No, but usually, if your door's closed, I can't hear anything.
Not me.
Those sounds were coming from that urn with Mrs Claxton in it.
Blanche, you were dreaming.
This house is possessed by her spirit.
- Morning.
- Last night, at two o'clock, did you hear some awful, ghastly sounds?
Heard 'em?
I made 'em.
There's a reason for expiration dates on cottage cheese.
My kingdom for an Alka-Seltzer.
Girls, I have great news.
I've found a resting place for Mrs Claxton.
You found one of her relatives?
I spread her ashes round the tree in front of her house.
- What on earth for?
- To prove her life had meaning.
- As fertiliser?
- No.
After I spread the ashes and said a prayer, I went to City Hall and told them.
I said it might not be such a good idea to disturb a person's resting place.
They're not going to cut the tree down.
Rose, that's lovely.
Odd, but lovely.
Girls, come look at the tree.
Isn't it breathtaking?
- It sure is.
- It's always gonna be there.
All because of Mrs Claxton.
I guess you were right all along, Rose.
Mrs Claxton did have a reason for being here.
- That tree will be a reminder.
- Reminder?
Reminder to do something nice whenever I can for somebody else.
I want my life to have meaning while I'm still living.
- What are you all looking at?
- That beautiful old oak tree.
Mrs Claxton's spirit's part of that tree now.
That's really lovely.
It's touching how that Great Dane is paying its respects.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Hi, Ma.
What are you watching?
I don't know.
One of those Steven Spielburger movies.
That's not a Steven Spielberg movie.
What are they doing?
You know.
We had that talk when you were 12.
Ma, I can't believe this.
You rented a dirty movie?
Dirty is in the eye of the beholder.
OK, maybe that's a little dirty.
I cannot watch any more of this.
Hi.
Wrong button.
That's fast forward.
Oh, my.
What are they doing?
I know what they're doing, but I never saw it at that speed.
It reminds me of my Uncle Ricky's rabbit farm.
- That's reverse, Dorothy.
- I did that once.
It was his birthday.
Ma, we did not get a VCR so you could watch dirty movies.
I'm 81, what are you worried about?
That I'll find someone to do that with?
- When's Jean coming?
- She's left the airport.
I hope she has a good time.
It was so tough for me after Charlie died.
She's getting better every day.
How long were Jean and Pat married?
They were together eight years.
Poor thing.
I wish there was something I could do.
I know.
I'll make my famous ice-cream clown sundaes.
The ones with little raisin eyes and sugar-cone caps.
If that doesn't fill the void, nothing will.
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.
Nothing.
I'm nervous about Jean.
She's very special.
I don't know if she'll get along with Blanche and Rose.
- Because she's a lesbian?
- Oh, Ma, she's not a lesbian.
What an absurd thing How did you know?
I've known since you two were in college together.
She didn't even know in college.
- How did you know?
- A mother knows.
Should I tell Rose and Blanche?
Jean is a nice person.
She just likes girls instead of guys.
Some people like cats instead of dogs.
I'd rather live with a lesbian than a cat.
Unless a lesbian sheds.
That I don't know.
- Jean.
- Dorothy.
Oh, honey, it is so good to see you.
Sophia.
You haven't aged a bit.
You look great.
You were always a terrific girl.
Dorothy, why can't you be more like Jean?
Scratch that.
- Where are your roommates?
- Jean, that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
I don't know how to phrase this.
The lesbian thing.
Do you keep it under your hat, or what?
Ma.
Jean, do you?
- I mean - I know what you mean.
You didn't say Pat was a woman.
They just assumed Pat was your husband.
I wanted to check with you before I told them.
Dorothy, I'm not embarrassed or ashamed of who I am.
You know your friends better than I do.
If you think they can handle it, I'd prefer to tell them.
Here we are.
Ice-cream clowns with hats for everybody.
It'll be our little secret.
Hi, Jean.
I'm Rose.
Nice to meet you, Rose.
- Ice-cream clown sundae?
- Jean will be here for a week.
Let's not have all the really big fun right away.
Oh, Blanche, this is my friend Jean.
- I'm so glad to meet you, Jean.
- Me too, Blanche.
I've heard so much about you, I feel like we're bosom buddies.
Ma, not a word.
We're gonna have such fun.
I know the best restaurants, - the best clubs, the best men.
- Blanche.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Was that insensitive of me?
Maybe you're not ready for men yet.
You don't know the half of it.
Jean, put your suitcase in Ma's room.
Ma's gonna sleep with me.
- You wouldn't mind?
- No problem.
I'll just remember when I get up at night the bathroom is to my left.
Last time we had a guest, I killed two potted palms.
So, tell me.
What do you have planned today, Jean?
Nothing special.
Jean, forgive me for dwelling on the subject of men, but isn't it about time you planned something special?
Oh, I couldn't.
Oh, come on.
Of course you could.
Believe her, Blanche, she couldn't.
I couldn't even think of another man for years after my husband died.
That's exactly why you have bad muscle tone.
Let me know if you change your mind.
I haven't eaten a breakfast like this since I left the farm.
Really?
You were raised on a farm?
- Until I was 17.
A dairy farm.
- Whoa.
A dairy farm?
Just like me.
Did you hear that?
Jean was raised on a dairy farm.
Why didn't you tell me Jean was raised on a dairy farm?
I was afraid it might be too much excitement for you.
- Did you help with the milking?
- Oh, yes.
Until we got a milking machine.
Thank goodness for the milking machine.
Hard as it is to leave, - I have to get ready for work.
- Yes, me too.
I can be in late today.
- Would you come to a matinee?
- That sounds great.
I remember when we first got our milking machine.
I hooked Molly up to it and she dropped like a rock.
- Oh, no.
- She wasn't electrocuted.
After that, she was no good for milking.
But she became the most popular cow during mating season.
I do love the rain so.
It reminds me of my first kiss.
Your first kiss was in the rain.
No, it was in the shower.
Sophia.
Where have you been?
I thought you were taking a nap.
- I went to the video store.
- I told you I'd go.
Forget it.
The last time you brought back Seven Brides For Seven Brothers.
You know how disappointed I was that it's a musical?
So, Jean and Rose aren't back yet?
They're probably having lunch together again.
They certainly have hit it off, haven't they?
I'm so glad.
Jean's such a lovely person.
Oh, yes, she is.
Lovely.
Dorothy, I don't want you to take this the wrong way, but there's something about Jean - that bothers me.
- Bothers you?
Every time I suggest she go on a date, you change the subject.
Come on, Blanche, that's ridiculous.
Look.
I think the rain is beginning to let up.
Dorothy, I may be a lot of things, but naive is not one of them.
Face it.
Your friend Jean is seeing a married man.
Blanche, that is absolutely uncanny.
I wasn't born yesterday.
- Oh, my God.
What happened?
- Don't worry, she'll be fine.
Of course you will, honey.
That phoney hair colour won't come out just cos it got wet.
It's not that.
We saw Love Story and Terms Of Endearment.
It was the Cry Me A River matinee at the Rialto.
I'll be back.
I want to change, then I'll make us some tea.
Blanche, would you mind if I spoke to Dorothy privately?
Mind?
Why, of course not.
And listen, don't you worry, your secret is safe with me.
Dorothy, I'm afraid I'm going to have to leave today.
Because of Blanche?
No, nothing to do with Blanche.
Something unexpected has come up.
- Back home?
Is it serious?
- It's not back home, but it is serious.
I haven't met anyone as good and decent as Rose since Pat died.
And I think I'm falling in love.
Not tonight, Salvadore, I've been cooking all day.
Ma, it's me.
It's Dorothy.
Oh, Dorothy.
The way your elbow was poking me, I thought it was your father sneaking up on me.
I'm sorry, Ma.
Go back to sleep.
- Ma - Is it morning already?
No.
- I want to ask you a question.
- What?
How would you react if you were told one of your kids was gay?
Your brother Phil is gay?
I knew it.
As a kid, we couldn't keep him away from gladiator movies.
Ma, Phil is not gay.
You mean you're gay?
Is Jean having a membership drive?
- Ma - Dorothy, I know you don't get many dates, but stick with what you know.
At your age, it's hard to break into something new.
- Good night.
- Ma.
I am not gay.
I just wanted to get your reaction.
I'll tell you the truth, Dorothy.
If one of my kids was gay, I wouldn't love him one bit less.
I would wish him every happiness.
You're the greatest mother in the world.
And I love you.
Fine.
Now keep your fat mouth shut so I can get some sleep.
Jean thinks she's in love with Rose.
Ma, come on.
It's not funny.
The hell it's not.
Jean in love with Little Miss Muffet?
Come on.
What is going on?
Nothing.
Come on.
I heard you laughing.
What's so funny?
For starters, Jean is a lesbian.
Ma.
What's funny about that?
- You aren't surprised?
- Of course not.
I've never known any personally, but isn't Danny Thomas one?
Not Lebanese, Blanche.
Lesbian.
Lesbian.
Lesbian.
Lesbian?
But isn't that where one woman and another We already know what it means.
Jean's very attractive.
She could have any man she wants.
- She doesn't want them.
- Well, why not?
A man has so much more to offer, you know?
I found that out when Mark Perper ran for Class President in the third grade.
What?
His slogan was "Vote for me, I'll show you my wee-wee".
He won by a landslide.
Well, I'll never understand what Jean doesn't see in the opposite sex.
But if that makes her happy, that's fine by me.
Jean's in love with Rose.
Rose?
Jean has the hots for Rose?
I do not believe it.
- I was pretty surprised myself.
- Well, I'll bet.
To think Jean would prefer Rose over me?
That's ridiculous.
Blanche, please.
If you had to pick me or Rose, who would you pick?
Blanche, pull yourself together.
Oh.
I'm sorry.
- Does Rose know?
- No.
Oh, good.
You shouldn't tell her.
After all, she's not as worldly about these things as I am.
If she hears Danny Thomas is a lesbian, it'll break her heart.
- Bless you.
- Stop blessing her.
She shouldn't have run around in the rain for dirty movies.
- I'm going to bed.
- Me, too.
I'll call it a night.
Don't sleep in the same bed as Sophia.
- You could get that cold.
- You're right.
Ma, take your own room.
Jean can sleep in my room.
You're letting a sick, old woman sleep in her own bed?
Bless you, warden.
I wouldn't mind sleeping here on the sofa.
That lumpy thing?
No.
You're sleeping in my room.
I think I'll retire too, to do my facial packs and compresses.
It takes me an hour, but that's why my skin is as smooth as a baby's bottom.
That must explain the urge I sometimes have to diaper your head.
- Want to play a few more hands?
- Sure.
Staying up like this playing games reminds me of my teenage slumber parties.
Oh, God.
Oh, I'll never forget my first slumber party.
We all fought over who had the cutest date for the prom.
- I never got to go to the prom.
- You're kidding.
Why?
Well, I really wanted to go with Delbert Twitchell.
He was the most gorgeous boy at our school.
And he was captain of the Precision Combine Drill team.
Actually, I was so sure Delbert was going to ask me, I turned down a foreign exchange student, Cyril Mountbatten.
Daddy didn't like Cyril anyway, cos he was British.
Daddy said the relationship would never work out, on account of the language barrier.
Daddy was a very caring and ignorant man.
Finally, it got to the day before the prom and Delbert still hadn't asked me.
So, I marched across a crowded cafeteria, stared him straight in the eye and said, "Delbert, what gives"?
He said, "Jenny McCoy.
That's why I'm taking her to the prom".
The first year after Charlie died was the hardest.
I'd lie awake for hours.
I could not get used to sleeping alone.
Then I took the extra pillows and shoved them under the covers to lie next to them.
It didn't really feel like Charlie, but sometimes it helped me fall asleep.
I'll have to try that.
Oh, it can't be two o'clock.
It is.
Oh, I'd better let you get some sleep.
- Good night, Rose.
- Good night.
Oh, Jean.
With it this late, don't wake Dorothy.
- Stay in my room tonight.
- Well, I suppose that makes more sense than waking Dorothy.
Good.
By the way, you're not a cover hog, are you?
- No.
- Good, cos I am.
Rose, are you awake?
Rose?
Am I hogging the covers?
Oh, no, no, no.
Everything's fine.
Rose, I want to tell you something.
If I don't say it, I'll never get to sleep.
What?
I like you very much, Rose.
I like you too, Jean.
I think you're very special.
I think you're special, too.
What I really want to say is, I I'm quite fond of you.
I'm fond of you, too.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Blanche, have you seen Jean?
- No.
I wonder where she could be.
Did she say anything when you got up?
- She never came to bed.
- Maybe she stayed with Sophia.
Ma, did Jean sleep with you last night?
There are a lot of things I want to try before I die, but that's not one of them.
Then she must have stayed in Rose's room.
My God.
You don't suppose Jean would ever you know?
Listen, Blanche.
I do not believe for one moment that anything other than gin rummy happened between Rose and Jean last night.
Dorothy?
Something terrible happened.
Oh, God.
If someone told you to jump off a bridge, would you do it?
Sophia, Blanche, would you excuse us?
You don't want to talk to me?
Thanks, but it really involves Dorothy's friend.
We're going, we're going.
OK, Rose, what is it?
- It's about Jean.
- What about Jean?
I don't want to shock you, Dorothy, but Jean I know.
Jean is gay.
You know already?
- How about Blanche?
- No, Blanche is not gay.
I don't mean that.
I mean, she knows?
- And Ma.
- You told everybody but me?
I didn't even know if you'd know what a lesbian was.
I could have looked it up.
I'm sorry.
I thought I was doing the right thing.
I guess I underestimated you.
That's not important.
I've got a problem.
I like Jean.
I like her a lot.
But I think she's in love with me.
- She told you?
- Well, not in so many words.
But I knew what she meant.
Unless I'm wrong, Dorothy.
You know I'm wrong about so many things.
You're not wrong about this.
Dorothy, what am I gonna do?
Dorothy, I Oh, hi, Rose.
What's with the suitcase?
I decided I do have to go.
- But you were going to stay - Dorothy, would you mind if I spoke with Jean?
No.
Fine.
Go ahead.
I'm going.
I'm going.
- Want a cup of coffee?
- Maybe I will have a coffee.
Rose, about last night.
I should never have said anything.
You only said what you were feeling.
It's just that this last year has been so difficult for me.
Pat was the person I planned to spend the rest of my life with.
And when she died, I just felt so terribly alone.
Empty.
I thought I could never care for anyone again.
Until I met you.
I just got very confused.
I hope I didn't make you feel uncomfortable.
Well, I have to admit, I don't understand these kinds of feelings.
But if I did understand, if I were, you know, like you, I'd be very flattered and proud that you thought of me that way.
Thank you, Rose.
I guess that's all I had to say.
Except you don't have to go.
Unless you think our friendship alone isn't enough.
It's enough.
This isn't what it looks like.
I know, I was listening at the door.
Why were you listening at the door?
Because I'm not tall enough to see through the window.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Morning, Ma.
Working on the crossword puzzle?
Nope.
Just lining up a few dates.
Let's see.
Maria Malanero, survived by her husband Tony Malanero.
You're getting dates out of the obituaries?
That's sick.
It is not sick.
It's practical.
Life is for the living.
Maria's loss is my date for the Early Bird Special.
Dorothy, this is unbelievable.
Look at this.
Heart surgeon turns out to be produce manager at A&P.
Further over.
Miami retailers to sponsor songwriting contest?
The Miami retailers are awarding $10,000 to the person who comes up with the best new song about Miami.
- $10,000?
- That's right.
I'm gonna enter.
You?
I have written songs before.
I wrote the fight song for our high school.
Onward, St Olaf.
They still sing it.
Onward, St Olaf Onward we go Onward and onward St Olaf's go Go, go, go Go, go, go, go, go Rose, Rose, I tell you Honey, it's a catchy tune, but who wrote those lyrics?
I did.
Lyrics aren't even my strong point.
I just got lucky that one time.
You're going to have to get a lot luckier than that to win that $10,000.
Rose, I have to confess, I dabbled a little in poetry-writing in high school.
That's nothing to be ashamed of.
A lot of tall girls who couldn't get dates wrote poetry in high school.
No, I meant that for $10,000 I might try my hand at lyric-writing.
I mean, maybe we could team up.
You mean, music by Rose Nylund and lyrics by Dorothy Zbornak?
Why not?
We could be the next Rodgers and Hammerstein.
The next Simon and Garfunkel.
The next Shari Lewis and Lamb Chop.
I don't know if I could get my hand that far up your dress.
But for $10,000, I'd be willing to give it a try.
- Good morning.
- Hi, Blanche.
Dorothy and I have decided to enter a songwriting contest together.
Now, that sounds like fun.
I always wanted to write a song.
It's like writing poetry, which I was never any good at.
Only the tall girls who couldn't get dates wrote poetry.
Hello?
Hello, Big Daddy.
No, no, no, she's right here.
Yeah, you take care, too.
Bye-bye, Big.
Big Daddy.
How in the world are you?
I'm just fine.
How can you say I look younger and more beautiful over the telephone?
No, it's true.
I just wondered how you knew over the telephone.
You're kidding.
That's great.
I'll see you Friday at four.
Bye-bye.
How exciting.
Big Daddy's going to be here on Friday.
He has a surprise for me.
I can't wait to see what it is.
Tony Malanero won't go out with me Friday night.
Ma, I'm not surprised.
His wife just died.
The man is still in mourning.
That's not the reason.
May Bloomfield beat me to him.
Did you get a chance to play around with those lyrics I gave you?
Yeah.
Listen to this.
That sounds great.
Let's take it from the top.
"From the top".
That sounds so musical.
Tickle the ivories, Rose.
Rose, play or die.
Miami is nice So I'll say it twice Miami is nice, Miami is nice Miami is n Wait a minute.
Wait.
You put in an extra "Miami is nice".
I had to, for the music's sake.
But the lyrics don't make any sense.
It goes, Miami is nice So I'll say it twice I see your point.
What about this?
Miami is nice So I'll say it thrice - Who the hell says "thrice"?
- It's a word.
So is "intrauterine".
But it does not belong in a song.
Miami, you're cuter than An intrauterine Here.
Rose, Dorothy, here, smell me.
I only do that with the milk, Blanche.
This is the last drop of that perfume Big Daddy gave me on my 21 st.
That was 20 years ago.
Blanche.
If your 21 st birthday was then, you'd only be 41.
- That's right.
- You look terrible for your age.
- Howdy, Dorothy.
- Mr Hollingsworth.
- Come in.
- Rose.
Big Daddy, let me look at you.
Let me look at you.
You're still as pretty as a ladybug sunning itself on a lily pad on a misty spring day south of Savannah.
Could you be more specific, Big Daddy?
Do my eyes deceive me or do I see Sophia Petrillo standing before me?
Or did you all get Sophia Loren as the new roommate?
Get out the boots.
He's back.
Come on.
Sit down here on the sofa betwixt us.
- "Betwixt"?
- Another word you don't know.
You don't even know the thrice of them were sitting on the couch together.
Big Daddy, what's this surprise?
Tell me, tell me before I burst.
I don't know how you'll take this.
Here goes.
There's a ladyfriend I've been spending a lot of time with recently.
- Do I know her?
- I don't think so.
Helen and Rooney McCoy introduced me to widow Spencer at their son's wedding a few months ago.
- I'd like to meet her sometime.
- She's coming tomorrow evening.
Just exactly what is this surprise, Daddy?
Don't get too excited, but we're planning on walking down the aisle.
Is she happy or sad?
I'm not sure.
She's never made that sound before.
I once heard her make that sound.
She was happy.
Daddy, I have never been happier in my entire life.
I'm glad.
I was worried how you'd react.
Nobody can ever replace Momma in my heart, but the important thing is for you to be happy.
- I wish you all the best.
- I hope you two will be happy.
I'll throw you and the widow Spencer the best wedding ever.
We hate fuss.
We're getting married in the Bahamas.
No, a Hollingsworth has to get married in style.
I don't want to impose.
No, let's have the wedding here.
We'll even write a song for the occasion.
No, we won't, Rose.
- Daddy, please.
- All right.
I never could say no to you.
Hello?
That's too bad.
A tragedy.
A terrible tragedy.
May she rest in peace.
Great news.
Theresa Lombardi passed away.
Ma, what's so great about that?
Her husband Freddy, he has nothing to do, and neither of us has seen Ruthless People.
Do you have a minute?
We've been up all night working on a song.
I think we might've hit on something.
M-l-A, another M-I M-l-A-M-I spells "Miami Beach" Girls.
It stirs emotion Girls.
It's by the ocean Girls.
So bring your suntan - Girls.
- What?
M-l-A-M-I don't spell "Miami Beach".
That spells "Miami".
- I told you not to add "Beach".
- Fine, fine.
You find something to rhyme with "Miami", hotshot.
Mammy!
Whammy, clammy, Alabamy, hootenanny, salami.
"Hootenanny" is marginal, and I refuse to accept "salami".
I have to go put up some coffee.
I'm expecting that lady from the caterer's.
I don't want to be a bad hostess.
"Salami", please.
I never had this trouble when I worked alone.
When you worked alone, you could only rhyme "go" with "go".
- Hello.
- Please come in.
You must be from the catering company.
Actually, I'm from Atlanta.
I'm Margaret Spencer.
What a coincidence.
Blanche's father is marrying a Margaret Spencer from Atlanta.
Only she's much older.
I think.
What do you think, Dorothy?
I'm just getting so excited about Big Daddy's wedding.
- Hello.
I'm Blanche Devereaux.
- Blanche, this is I'd like you to meet Say hello to Big Mommy.
I'm sorry I'm so early.
Traffic wasn't what I expected.
The important thing is, you got here safely.
It's so good to finally meet you, Blanche.
Your father's told me so much about you.
- I wish I could say the same.
- Margaret, please, sit down.
We ought to get her a booster seat.
- Can I get you a drink?
- Chocolate milk?
So, Margaret, you're from Atlanta.
That's right.
That child is trying to steal my Daddy away.
She's no better than a tick on a slow-moving dog.
Why is everyone around here talking like Burl Ives?
I'll get it.
Lovely city.
Have they rebuilt it since it burned down in Gone With The Wind?
Big Daddy.
I'm glad you're here.
I see you're getting acquainted.
Hi, darling.
We need to talk.
Rose, let's show Margaret how you make the hose dance around when you turn it on full blast.
You said I couldn't do that anymore.
Today's a special day.
She makes it all twirl around.
It's such fun.
What do you think of Maggie?
- Does it matter?
- Of course it does.
All right, then.
I'll be frank.
- She's a gold-diggin' hussy.
- You watch your tongue, missy.
That woman is too young for you.
She's practically my age.
I'm not ashamed to love a younger woman.
- Why keep it a secret?
- I didn't.
I didn't think age mattered to you.
Daddy, this is wrong.
You're just making a fool of yourself.
As long as the Good Lord keeps me on this earth, I'm your father.
Don't you ever call me a fool.
Daddy, just please call off this wedding.
Once, in grade school, I crossed a rutabaga and a potato, but I couldn't decide whether to call it a "rutatato" or a "potatobaga".
Yeah, you'll have to excuse Rose.
That hose dance brings up a lot of childhood memories.
Can I please speak to you in private?
Blanche, this conversation is over.
Margaret, we're leaving.
Daddy.
She's not for you.
You're just dragging our family name through the mud.
Blanche, I've always given you my love and respect.
If you can't give a little back, you're no longer a part of our family.
We're doing great.
The song will be fine.
We just need a rhyme for "orange".
What rhymes with "orange"?
- Cheesecake?
- "Orange cheesecake".
"Orange cheesecake".
I suppose that could work.
I meant to eat, Rose.
- Why are you not at the piano?
- We're blocked.
I've been having good luck with Tank, immediately followed by a granola bar.
- How are you doing?
- I feel terrible.
I'm a wreck.
All I can think about is Big Daddy and that woman.
Cut me some cheesecake.
Bigger.
Why are you getting so upset?
You see older men with younger women all the time.
It's very common.
Look at John Derek and Ursula Andress.
John Derek and Linda Evans.
John Derek and Bo Derek.
You know, maybe it's not so common.
Maybe it's just one guy.
If older men knew how ridiculous they look with younger women, - they wouldn't do it.
- They don't see it that way.
In a restaurant the other night, a man of 60 walked in wearing four gold chains and his shirt open to his navel.
I thought people were staring at the scars to his bypass surgery.
They were staring at the 22-year-old blonde on his arm.
Honey, he was not embarrassed, he was proud.
Maybe he was out with the woman he loved.
Please, Rose.
There was a 40-year age difference.
What could they possibly have in common?
Girls, love has no definition, no boundaries.
Age has nothing to do with it.
Sometimes two people who seem to have the least in common turn out to be the most in love.
That was the case with OIlie Stettlenmeier and Molly-Jane Doe.
OIlie and Molly?
Must we take yet another trip to Petticoat Junction?
OIlie was the mayor and our town's most respected citizen.
He was also Artistic Director at the St Olaf Community Playhouse.
A lot of people don't know this, but the family drama Hey, That's My Tractor started right there.
Wasn't the musical version called Hey, Hey, That's My Tractor?
Anyway, during the auditions, the first woman who walked through that door was Molly-Jane Doe, the town manicurist.
For five extra dollars, she'd buff more than your nails.
Five dollars?
It was during the Depression.
In Italy, for five dollars you got a woman, a manicure, a cappuccino and a box of cookies for your wife.
- A fact.
Use it as you wish.
- It was love at first sight.
Nobody in town could believe that this man, who'd lived for 52 years with his mother, would fall head over heels in love with the town squeeze.
But he did.
And the next day they were married and they went on to live happily together for 25 years.
What has this to do with my father?
Because nobody knows why two people fall in love, and it's really nobody's business.
He's my father.
It is my business.
I'll give those two a piece of my mind.
If you go over there angry, you'll make things worse.
I'm sorry, but I have to say what I feel.
"I have to say what I feel".
I have to say what I feel Miami has so much appeal A great place to get a seafood meal Miami.
- Simon?
- Yes, Garfunkel?
- To the eighty-eights.
- Yes.
Yes?
Yes, just give us something on the beach.
We'll be there on our honeymoon.
Come on in, sweetheart, door's open.
Yes, just a sea view and plenty of privacy.
- Isn't that right, darling?
- No, Daddy, it isn't.
Excuse me.
I'll call you back.
I'm not sure I want to see you.
I reckon you spoke your piece already.
I've been thinking, and I think I've started to understand the reasons you're doing what you're doing.
Can I talk to you?
Daddy, when a man reaches your age, he wonders who's going to be there to take care of him.
Yes.
And he might even start looking for somebody to replace his first wife.
- He might.
- He might even look for ways to feel a little bit younger.
He certainly might.
But, Daddy, is that reason to get married?
Just 'cause some pretty, sexy, bouncing, bubbly young thing takes an interest in you?
Hell, yes.
But there's another reason.
Blanche, when you spend six months watching the person you love more than anybody else slowly die, you wonder if you'll ever love again.
After that, believe me, if you can even think of marrying someone else, there's only one reason.
You're in love.
I know Momma's dying hurt you quite a bit.
Yes, it did.
But I'm talking about Margaret.
Her husband died two years ago, shortly after your momma.
- I didn't know.
- She loves me and I love her and we want to get married.
Sorry, Daddy.
I'm trying to help you and it turns out you don't need me.
No, that's not true.
The reason we came down here in the first place is because we do need you and your blessing on our marriage.
I'm sorry.
It's all right.
I was just leaving.
I want to say something to you first.
What is it, Blanche?
Looks like you and I have more in common than we thought.
We both love Big Daddy and want him to be happy, so welcome to the family.
Sophia, here's a postcard from Big Daddy and Margaret.
They're having the time of their life in the Bahamas.
Please.
The big news is, he lived through the wedding night.
People in their seventies and eighties can have great sex.
Yeah, with people in their seventies and eighties.
Put me in a bedroom with Tom Cruise and you'd be peeling me off the ceiling.
According to Big Daddy, he still has both his feet on the ground.
I gotta say, you handled it better than I thought you would.
I'm not thrilled, but as long as they're in love and I don't have to call her Mommy, I can live with it.
How did you do?
- We came in second.
- Terrific.
What did you get?
Treated badly.
They told us to get out of the way when they took the winner's picture.
Photos and judges.
I'd love to hear your song.
- Forget it, Blanche.
- The experience was painful.
- Please.
- We want to forget it.
- Please.
- Hit it, Rose.
I have to say what I feel Miami has so much appeal A great place to get a seafood meal Miami Miami, Miami You've got style Blue skies, sunshine White sand by the mile When you live in this town Each day is sublime The coldest of winters Are warm and divine Miami, Miami You've got style Blue skies, sunshine White sand by the mile There's more clubs and nightclubs All within reach Dance the samba till morning Then lie on the beach Each view is a postcard Each day a great time The cream of the crop It's the top of the line Miami, Miami You've got style Blue skies, sunshine White sand by the mile Miami You've got style.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Ma, what are you doing?
It's a funny little habit I picked up.
I call it eating.
Rose made it for her daughter.
You can't eat till she comes.
Oh, please, there's enough food here to feed my entire village in Sicily.
- Blanche.
- Help me.
Oh, my back gave out.
I figured that would be the third thing to go.
What happened?
I was in my aerobics class when I noticed this gorgeous man.
During the buttocks lifts, he motioned for my number.
I didn't wanna appear easy, so I rolled over and flung my legs over my head.
That's what I call giving him the brush-off.
- Hi, Mom.
- My God, it's Michael.
Michael.
Look, Ma, it's Michael.
Oh, honey, what a surprise.
You look great.
I'm glad to see you.
I've missed you.
Why the hell haven't you written, you little ingrate?
He's a musician in New York.
He hasn't time to write.
- Hi, Grandma.
- Don't hi me.
You can't pick up a phone and call your grandmother?
You look terrific, Grandma.
I know.
So give me a kiss.
I want you to meet my friend, Blanche.
Blanche, Michael.
I would get up but I've thrown my back out of whack You don't have to explain.
Mother told me about you.
- Why didn't you say you were coming?
- I could have cooked a meal.
My job at the jazz club ended so I came here.
- I'm so glad you did.
- You play jazz?
The only white boy from Brooklyn who could scat.
But I thought the job was till the end of summer.
I had artistic differences with the club owner.
People pick on him because he's talented.
He wanted everyone to wear a tie and I refused.
Michael stands up for his principles.
He's the Norma Rae of the music business.
Everybody, I want you to meet my daughter, Bridget.
Bridget, this is Blanche.
And Dorothy.
And Sophia.
And a total stranger.
This is my son, Michael.
He's staying with us.
Ma, you don't have the space.
Don't be silly, you can have my room.
I'll camp out on the couch.
Michael, it's nice meeting you.
Dorothy's told us about you.
- This is my daughter, Bridget.
- Hello.
Bridget's going to study at Oxford, England.
I've found a terrific flat on campus.
Great.
I hear the commute from here's a killer.
- Pardon me?
- It was a joke.
- Cute.
- Where do you go to school?
College isn't really my style.
I attend the school of life.
A lot of people go there when they can't get accepted anywhere else.
Cute.
Bridget, I know you're hungry after your trip, honey.
- I fixed your favourite things.
- It looks delicious.
Wait.
Where are the wooden shoes I carved out of cheese?
My mother spread them on the tiny windmill you built out of Triscuits.
- This is my best breakfast in ages.
- Me, too.
Normally she feeds me lumpy oatmeal and black bananas.
- I'll do that.
- No, you won't.
- You don't have to.
- I enjoy doing it.
Here, why not double your fun?
- Good morning.
- How's your back?
- Terrible.
- What did the doctor say?
I am the most spectacular specimen of the female anatomy he has seen since Julie Newmar.
- He said it's a back problem.
- Thank God he's a specialist.
He said no activity for a week.
I have to wear a corset and lie back with my legs elevated.
That's the same thing you did last Saturday.
Honey, you just follow the doctor's orders and everything'll be fine.
I don't think I can go without physical activity for a week.
I have serious needs.
I'm at my sexual peak.
- Blanche.
- Well, I am, Dorothy.
- When a woman's at her peak - This is my child.
I wish you wouldn't treat me like a child.
Don't be ridiculous.
I don't treat you like one.
Here's $10.
Go take your grandmother to see The Journey Of Natty Gann.
Shut up and take the money.
Forget the movie.
We'll double our money at the track, and goof on bums.
- Michael seems like a nice man.
- Oh, he really is.
But I'm worried about him.
He's always been a little flighty.
I wouldn't worry about that.
Grandma always said I was a little flighty.
Or was it a little floozy?
- Morning, everyone.
- You want some breakfast?
No.
Bridget packed a delicious meal and drove me to the country.
We took a walk and picked wild flowers.
We waded in the creek and then guess what?
Julie Andrews showed up, you all fed deer and sang, "If I Had A Hammer".
Rose, sounds like you had a lovely morning.
Oh, it was.
But it made me sad.
I realised how much I'll miss her.
We've always been close.
I was the same way with Michael.
Was?
I thought you got on great.
It's not that we don't get on.
It's just that we think differently.
I think he should settle down and find a job.
He thinks he should be travelling over the country, trying to find himself.
Maybe what Michael needs is a little exposure.
- Exposure to what?
- To plutonium, Rose.
To somebody more career-oriented, somebody like Bridget.
Maybe if they spent time together, she'd be a positive influence.
Are you suggesting that Michael and Bridget go out?
That is exactly what I'm suggesting.
I don't think so.
I stay out of my children's social lives.
- I'm afraid I agree with Rose.
- Like that Scandinavian saying, "You can lead a herring to water but you have to walk really fast or he'll die".
Alright, fine.
I thought they'd have more fun together instead of hanging around with me and three old ladies.
I'll get changed.
Bridget's taking me to the House of Fabrics for the felt sale.
I hope I don't get too crazy.
You'd better take a tranquilliser before you go.
Remember, last time, you hyperventilated and almost passed out.
I never passed out at the House of Fabrics.
I passed out at the World of Wool.
For the first time in my life, my body feels old.
I can't do the things I used to.
Rubber Woman couldn't do the things you used to.
It's only natural that, as you're growing older, your body changes.
- It falls apart.
- It does not fall apart.
For 50 years, I look like Chita Rivera.
One morning, my butt's like a bulldog's neck.
I remember when I felt I was getting older.
I was visiting my daughter.
She had a walk-up apartment, five flights up.
It got harder and harder each year to climb those stairs.
Finally, one year, I couldn't make it without stopping.
It depressed me for weeks.
Oh, my God.
Is that what I have to look forward to, 15 years from now?
- Another game?
- I don't feel like it.
- Play with Michael.
- He's not here.
- Where is he?
- You were at the market.
The kids decided to go out.
- Michael asked Bridget out?
- Not exactly, no.
I just happened to have some free tickets to the symphony.
So I suggested they take 'em.
Both Rose and I told you not to interfere with their social lives.
I just thought it might be fun.
A set-up date is never fun.
In Sicily, everything is set up.
Dates, marriage, death.
Especially death.
Whenever I go into a restaurant, I sit with my back to the wall.
Except any diner in Newark, where if you're against the wall, you stick.
Hi, Blanche.
Shouldn't you be lying down?
But I'm tired of being on my back.
Did I just say that?
Are the kids back from their date?
- Our kids?
- No, the Katzenjammer Kids.
Of course our kids.
We decided not to interfere.
We did, but Blanche here decided differently.
Oh, Blanche, how could you?
Well, I don't know what all the fuss is about.
- I heard 'em come in hours ago.
- I'll say good night to Bridget.
- Can you bring my heating pad?
- Sure.
Dorothy, do you realise it's been four days since I've enjoyed the company of a man?
I know, Blanche.
I've been marking the days off on my Big Ships of the Navy calendar.
I can't stand it much longer.
My body feels like a Corvette on blocks with its engine racing and the wheels just spinning with nowhere to go.
I feel like I'm gonna explode.
Dorothy, you must help me.
Do something.
Honey, there's nothing I can do.
So let go of my hand.
Oh, my God.
Hi there.
Rose, don't look.
- Michael, get out of that bed.
- Believe me, Mom, I'd like to.
But as my clothes are hanging on the doorknob, it's not a good idea.
Oh, my God.
They're naked.
People usually are in this situation, Rose.
Unless they're all dressed up in costumes.
Sorry.
What's all the commotion?
Oh, boy.
- This isn't what it looks like.
- I'm 80 years old.
I may not remember what it feels like, but I remember what it looks like.
- Grandma, listen - You, listen.
How dare you come here and act like a gigolo?
You've embarrassed me, your mother, our friends.
Not to mention that poor, stupid, flat-chested girl.
You've broken my heart.
I'm ashamed you're my grandson.
Look what you've done.
I hope you're proud of yourself.
Bridget, I am shocked at your behaviour.
Why doesn't everybody just calm down?
Bridget and Michael went out, had a great time.
It was nice.
I wouldn't call it great.
Sorry, too much wine.
Would you like us to leave so you can try again?
Dorothy.
I don't think we should encourage them.
Why don't we let them get dressed?
Then we can discuss this like rational human beings.
That's a good idea, Blanche.
Rose, I meant let them get dressed in private.
Oh, sorry.
I guess I'm still in shock.
I've never seen Bridget in bed with a man.
Except Raggedy Andy.
- I just can't believe it.
- Believe it, Rose.
I can't.
You know when you can't believe something?
I can't believe Alan Thicke has a hit series.
That doesn't mean it isn't so.
- I blame you for this, Blanche.
- Why?
But for that date, Michael wouldn't have seduced Bridget.
- What?
He didn't seduce her.
- You were there?
- I happen to know.
- How?
- Bridget isn't his type.
- No, she's too good for him.
How about a nice glass of lemonade?
- Why is she too good for him?
- He has no job.
Neither does Henry Kissinger but he's still highly regarded.
- My son is an artist.
- A nice way of saying loser.
My son is not a loser.
He happens to be very talented.
Yes, at taking advantage of poor young girls.
You agree he does have talent.
Rose, face it, your daughter moves faster than Marcus Allen.
I can't face it.
I don't even know who Marcus Allen is.
Let me put it to you another way.
When are you gonna accept that your daughter is not the goody two-shoes you think?
- What do you mean?
- What would you call a girl who sleeps with a man she's known for one day?
A damn good sport.
- I call her a tramp.
- What?
You heard me, tramp.
Tramp, tramp, tramp.
Dorothy, we've always had our differences.
But I don't think you've said anything so vicious or so cruel.
I don't think I can speak to you again.
- Go after her.
- I will not.
I'm not the only one who was cruel.
- Morning.
- I'm not talking to you.
You're still upset with me about last night?
No, I'm upset because Crockett and Tubbs are wearing darker colours.
Good morning.
Why are you dressed like that?
I'm introducing my line of tennis wear.
What do you think?
I'm in mourning.
- For whom, Sophia?
- Michael.
After last night, he doesn't exist.
Oh, excuse me, I didn't see you.
Morning, Rose.
I guess you're still mad at me, too, huh?
- That's right.
- Oh, girls.
Nobody could be more upset about last night than I am.
I was just trying to be hospitable.
I sent the kids to the symphony to hear Henry Mancini's tribute to the Pink Panther.
I didn't expect them to jump into bed.
Besides, it's not the end of the world.
These things do happen.
The same thing happened to me in my early 20s.
I was taking some classes at Miss McGyver's finishing school.
One night, Bobby Jo Springer had escorted me back to my dormitory after the annual Fine Manners ball, when an innocent good-night kiss developed into an evening of passion.
But at 3am, the door flung open and there stood Miss McGyver, making one of those bed checks she was famous for.
I tried to handle the whole thing like a lady.
I waved politely over Bobby Jo's shoulder with my foot.
She was unmoved.
Next day, she sat me down, lectured me and kicked me out of school.
Only, I didn't care.
I knew what ecstasy was.
All she could do was walk around with a dictionary on her head.
Alright, maybe you don't feel like talking to me.
But talk to your children.
Tell them how you feel.
Only, make sure after it's all over that it's brought you closer together, not further apart.
Who are you, Mr Spock?
I think you mean Dr Spock, Sophia.
They're both real smart and they've got big ears, so don't get technical, OK?
I am speaking from experience, Sophia.
I failed to listen to my children.
You don't see any of them visiting here.
I don't even see my hand in front of my face.
Blanche, you're making a lot of sense.
We were so busy protecting our kids, we fought with each other.
- I owe you an apology.
- I owe you one.
- No, no, no - Girls, what's the difference?
The important thing is, we're all friends again.
Maybe you're all friends again, but not me.
I don't forgive or forget.
I'm prone to growing moles.
I'm Italian.
No, no, please, go on.
That's enough.
- Let's talk about last night.
- Sure, Ma.
You ungrateful brat, how could you do this to me?
I'm sorry.
That's not what I planned on saying.
It's OK.
You've every right to be angry.
I don't understand how you could do this.
It wasn't anything planned.
The whole thing just kind of happened.
Just kind of happened?
Michael, dandruff just kind of happens.
Not a thing like this.
If you don't know that, I've failed somewhere.
Stop torturing yourself.
None of this is your fault.
- It is.
Where did I go wrong?
- You're a great mother.
If I were, you would be graduating from medical school, not playing doctor with my best friend's daughter here in this house.
Ma, I'm sorry.
It wasn't the right time and it ended up embarrassing you and your friends.
- I guess I wasn't thinking.
- That's your problem, Michael.
You go through life not thinking.
You go from town to town, job to job, relationship to relationship.
Michael, you're 29 years old.
When will you grow up and accept some responsibility?
I'm sorry about what happened.
I'm sorry I won't be all you hoped I'd be.
The only thing I want you to be is happy.
I don't want you waking up one morning, sorry for choices you made.
I appreciate that.
But, Ma, I have to live my own life.
Despite my flaws, I am basically a decent, honest person.
Do you think you could just love me for that?
I already do.
Then you forgive me?
Of course I forgive you.
But if you ever pull a stunt like that again, I am going to throw you out on your flawed but honest behind.
- So, did you two make up?
- Yes, Ma.
Did you apologise and beg her forgiveness?
- Yes, Grandma.
- OK, now do it to me.
I'm sorry.
I wouldn't hurt you.
I hope you can forgive me.
- That's it?
- I promise to write more often.
- And?
- And call you every week.
Every week?
You think I don't have a social life?
You can call me every other week.
- OK, every other week.
- Good, you're forgiven.
Thank God this is over.
I couldn't see a thing through this crap.
I'm all packed and ready to go.
I'll have your lunch done soon.
Mom, I think we should talk.
- Why don't we forget about it?
- I don't want to.
I forgive you.
I know it wasn't your fault.
Mom.
You've got to stop pretending I'm some perfect angel.
I'm not.
I make mistakes.
What I did the other night was one of them.
I am sorry about embarrassing you and your friends.
But that doesn't change the fact that I slept with Michael.
Oh, honey, I so wanted your first time to be special.
It was, Mom.
Four years ago.
Oh, I really don't wanna talk about this.
I want us to talk about this.
I want us to have an open, honest relationship.
I wanna be able to share my deepest, darkest secrets with you.
Couldn't we just wear matching outfits?
Mother.
I'm sorry, honey, but it's just that Suddenly, it's like you're a whole new person.
It's gonna take a little getting used to.
I understand.
- I'll miss you very much.
- I'll miss you, too, Mom.
You're sure I can't drive you to the airport?
No, I'll be fine.
Dorothy, Sophia, thank you for having me.
Don't thank me, thank my grandson.
Well, gotta go.
I thought you were staying till the end of the week.
I got a call for a gig in New Orleans.
Good luck to you, sweetheart.
Call me when you get there.
I will.
Bye-bye, Grandma.
- Be good, Michael.
- Rose.
- Wanna share a taxi?
- Sounds great.
Make sure that's all you share.
- You two have a safe trip.
- Bye-bye, Mom.
Girls, how do I look?
- Where are you going?
- On a date.
The doctor said take it easy.
He did, but I'm going stir-crazy.
I have to get out.
- Stick to the doctor's orders.
- I think Dorothy's right.
Who knows my body better than I do?
Any man in Miami not attached to a woman or a respirator.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Ma, you sure you'll be all right while we're away?
- Dorothy, I'll be fine.
- Listen.
Behave yourself.
Don't use the car.
No parties.
And stay out of the liquor cabinet while we're gone.
Hey, who am I?
Gidget?
Get out of here.
- Do you have the tickets?
- Yes, Rose.
- And the passports?
- Yes, Rose.
- And Pepto-Bismol?
- Yes, Rose.
- Dramamine?
- Yes, Rose.
- Chewing gum to pop our ears?
- Yes, Rose.
Did you call a cab to get to the airport?
I called two.
One for Blanche and me and one for you.
You're making me crazy.
I'm just worried about travelling out of the country.
With the problems in the Middle East.
We're going to an island in the Caribbean.
Our biggest worry is getting strap marks.
Come on, now.
Blanche, you can't take all that luggage.
But, Dorothy, I may run into a celebrity while I'm sunbathing.
I packed what I need to make me look devastating.
Then I hope you packed a tight butt.
Oh.
Oh, yes.
Is this your cab or mine?
Rose, there's only one cab.
How am I getting to the airport?
Run behind it.
I hate leaving you like this.
Why don't you come with us?
Come on, Sophia, it'll be fun.
And the resort is gorgeous.
Look here.
Isn't that beautiful?
You can have the king-size bed.
There's already two people in it.
Ma, please.
If not, I'll spend my entire vacation worrying about you.
It'll be nice to have the house to myself.
I can vacuum in the nude.
Now, get out of here.
Take care, Sophia.
I'll call you the minute I get to the hotel.
Mr Mitsumo.
Hi, Mr Mitsumo.
I've been meaning to tell you you did a lovely job getting rid of the snails.
It's nice not crunching when I go to the mailbox.
Did I mention that my daughter and her roommates just left on vacation?
They'll be gone for five days.
Anyway, I notice we're always smiling at each other.
So I was thinking now that we have a little privacy, maybe sometime we could smile and talk over a glass of Tang or something.
Tang.
Tang is not the catchword here.
What I mean is, I think you're very nice and I thought we liked each other, you and me.
This is very embarrassing.
You don't understand a word I'm saying.
Understand.
Little.
You can put the luggage right There would be fine, too.
Girls, this room looks nothing like the pictures in the brochure.
This isn't good enough for you?
Well, not for $100 a night.
Americans.
You measure everything by the dollar.
We're trying to learn the metric system.
It's not that easy.
This place is like a sweatbox.
Oh, great.
The air conditioner's not working.
Who needs air conditioning?
We have a fresh ocean breeze and a breathtaking view.
We have no view.
When the revolution comes, and the heads of Imperialist swine are impaled on sticks stuck in the sand for people to spit on, you'll be glad you don't got a view.
This isn't solving anything.
I'm going to call the manager.
Hello.
Hello?
Great.
The phone's dead.
Makes no difference.
You only get lies from that scum-sucking pig.
Would you go downstairs and tell the scumsucker we want to see him?
OK.
But his days are numbered.
When the revolution comes, he's the second to be shot.
- Who's the first?
- Morales.
My next-door neighbour, who knocked up my sister.
This is dandy.
Just dandy.
I should never have been talked into coming to this godforsaken place.
Come off it, Blanche.
We agreed this is where we'd spend our vacation.
All I wanted was a tan on my thighs.
Now I'll probably end up a prisoner of the revolution.
They'll rip my blouse and make me cook for the officers and spit food in my face and make fun of my recipes.
And, eventually, I'll catch the eye of some fat general with big sweat stains under his arms.
And he'll force me to let out his uniforms and satisfy his ugly needs.
It sounds like Christmas with my ex-husband.
I don't know what you are complaining about.
I'm the one who'll suffer most.
With no air conditioning, I'll get all wilted.
No man will talk to me.
How can I get dates without a telephone?
The way you always do.
Go sit in the bar without underwear.
Evening.
I'm Jacques Decourville, manager of Rustling Palms and reigning island limbo king.
Oh, please, please, come in.
Talk to me.
What's the problem here?
To begin with, Mr Decourville, in here it says that every room has an ocean view.
Now, where is ours?
Give me it.
Come here, Kiddo.
Here, over here.
Stick your head out of the window.
Look to the extreme left and what do you see?
Two guys beating up an old lady.
Beyond that.
- The ocean.
- I rest my case.
Wait.
You call that an ocean view?
You have to be a contortionist.
Hey, it doesn't say "great ocean view".
Now, look, these accommodations are simply unacceptable.
We want the room described in the brochure or we take our business elsewhere.
OK, have it your way.
But don't expect a refund.
We've just checked in.
We haven't paid for this room.
Yes, we have.
I'm sorry.
My travel agent said it would be easier to prepay everything.
Believe me, it is.
What do we do now?
We have no choice.
We have to stay.
Goody.
If you need anything, any time day or night, you call me.
We can't.
The phone is dead.
There's plenty of stationery in the bureau drawer.
Write me.
I'm starting to root for the revolution.
Well, we're here now.
Come on.
Let's make the best of it.
Maybe this room isn't a total loss.
A vibrating bed.
Let's give it a try.
Come on.
Come on, it'll be fun.
Are you ready?
Guantanamera Juanita Guantanamera Guantanamera Juanita Guantanamera This has been a great day, Mr Mitsumo.
Toshiro.
This has been a great day, Toshiro.
Driving your Lawn-Boy was so exciting.
Eat.
Eat.
That's amazing.
You eat with little sticks, never missing a bite.
My people drop half their meal while using a fork, a spoon and bread.
So, see, so.
So, exactly Exactly what is this stuff?
Is sushi.
Raw fish.
Very good.
That flew right out of my hand.
That was delicious.
I couldn't eat another bite.
I've got to tell you.
Even though you eat raw fish and listen to a piano being tuned, I find you awfully cute.
Sophia, cuter.
Blanche, what is all that stuff?
Just my natural beauty supplements.
This is my apricot facial scrub and my honey skin toner and my coconut moisturizer.
If I put cracked ice and an umbrella on your head, you'd be a mai tai.
I wish we had packed a bug spray.
Girls, I've got our whole day planned tomorrow.
After breakfast, we're going to go out on a glass-bottomed boat.
And then at ten o'clock, we'll tour an old Spanish fort.
Then at three o'clock, we'll visit the wreck of the Santa Juanita.
We'll finish off the day with a sunset hike to explore a dormant volcano.
All right, forget the volcano.
No, Rose, I just killed a mosquito on your cheek.
Thank you very much, Dorothy.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll go wash this squashed bug off my face.
Yeah, just a minute.
Won't be very long.
Okey-dokey, take your time.
There's somebody in the bathroom.
He said he wouldn't be long.
Hey, don't rush me.
It'll take as long as it's gonna take.
I don't believe this.
There's a man in our bathroom.
Dorothy, relax, let me handle this.
Hello there.
Excuse me, sir.
Are you married?
As a matter of fact, I'm not.
I hope one day you meet the woman of your dreams, but who are you and why are you in our bathroom?
- I'm Dwayne and that's Rick.
- And I'm Winston Hardwick III.
We're very glad to meet you, but what are you doing in our bathroom?
This is our room.
I'm afraid we six have to share this bathroom.
I'm not sharing a bathroom with three strange men.
I don't care if it is my vacation.
You've got no choice, lady.
There just aren't enough johns.
- This is ridiculous.
- Yeah?
You think we're happy having to gargle next to Grandma Moses and the Mosettes?
You You You rude person.
Go easy on him, Lola.
Ladies, as long as we're stuck with each other, let me give you a piece of friendly advice.
Buzz off.
- Beat it.
- Yeah, scram.
Look, kid, you can just kiss my patootie.
This is our john, and if you have to go, the jungle's that way.
Come on, ladies.
The meal was disgusting.
What do you girls want to do now?
Let's draw cards for the rest of the Pepto-Bismol.
Oh, no, it's those nasty boys.
Ladies, I hate to disturb you, but we would like to buy you a drink.
- Why, thank you.
- Blanche.
I'm sorry.
It was a reflex reaction.
No, thank you and goodbye.
Look, we had a chance to think about what we said last night and we're real sorry.
It must have been a shock finding us in your bathroom.
Please accept our apologies.
Well all right, apology accepted.
Now you can buy us that drink.
A magnum of your best champagne.
So, how have you ladies been enjoying your vacation?
As a child during the Depression, I had to have my wisdom teeth extracted by a shoemaker.
That was more fun than this.
Ladies, let's face it.
The island's a bore.
However, I just happen to have access to a sailboat tonight.
Are you interested in an evening cruise?
I'm game.
What about you girls?
- Sounds like fun.
- Why not?
We'll meet you back here in 45 minutes.
That'll give me enough time to call my mother.
Your mother's still living?
I'm sorry.
Now try the veal piccata.
You'll weep.
Sophia very sweet.
Toshiro, can I make a confession?
You bring out the beast in me.
I know you look at me, you think, "There's a chick who gets around".
But until I met you, I didn't know I still had those feelings.
You made me realize there's a lot of wisdom in what Sicilians say about the old olive tree.
Although it's ancient and gnarled, and not much to look at, it still has the tastiest, plumpest olives.
Toshiro, how about an olive?
Olive?
I realize you don't understand most of this.
But that's OK.
I was married 45 years.
My husband spoke perfect English, never understood a word I said.
Toshiro, I think it's time you learned some English.
Lesson number one.
Kiss.
Who the hell is this?
Dorothy, nice to hear from you.
How's the vacation?
Good.
Nothing's happening here.
Take care.
Lesson number one.
Kiss.
Oh, beautiful Mother Earth.
Land, land at last.
How long were we out there?
At least two rosaries.
We're lucky to be alive.
You miserable low-down piece of Yankee slime.
Blanche, I sense some hostility towards me.
How'd you like to sense a coconut upside your head?
- Get a hold of yourself.
- I don't want to.
They sail us right out in the middle of a storm.
And we end up shipwrecked on this godforsaken island.
So, we made a few mistakes.
Nobody's perfect.
- What's the big deal?
- "What's the big deal"?
You almost killed us, you nitwits.
I hate you.
I curse the day I ever laid eyes on you.
I curse the day your momma laid eyes on your daddy, and the day he laid down with her.
You ladies should be grateful.
It was our superior sailing skill that saved your lives.
Hanging onto the mast, screaming, "Please, God, take the old ladies, but don't hurt us".
That does not qualify as skill.
Look, ladies, we've taken all the guff we're gonna take.
You're gonna take all the guff I got and like it.
All right, everybody, now shut the hell up.
I'm in charge.
From now on, everyone listens to me.
Why should we listen to you?
I am the most decorated pioneer scout in the history of northern Minnesota.
I can build a 100-foot rope bridge, start a fire with rocks, distil sea water into drinking water.
If you want to get out of this alive, listen to me.
Any objections?
No.
I didn't think so.
Start breaking up the boat.
We need wood for a fire.
And, you three, head up that ridge.
Based on rock formations, there's a good chance of a waterfall.
If you find nothing, head back to the coastline and look for our fire.
Now, move.
I said move.
Dorothy, should we be listening to Rose?
Quiet.
I don't think we're allowed to talk while we work.
How long have they been gone?
Over four hours.
Think anything happened to them?
No, they probably just stopped to rest.
Maybe they're looking for something to carry water.
Maybe they were clawed to death by bloodthirsty animals.
Unfortunately, water isn't all that can be around that rock formation.
You're kidding?
A pioneer scout always tells the truth.
So I'm going to be even more honest.
Our big worry is nobody knows we're missing so nobody's looking for us.
The odds are decent that we're all gonna die.
Oh, Rose.
Come on, now.
You're just tired and thirsty.
Yeah, we're all tired and thirsty.
Let's not wait for the boys.
Whip us up a batch of fresh water made from sea water.
About the sea water - You don't know how to do it?
- I know how.
There's just one little problem.
I need a ten-gallon copper pot, seven feet of aluminium tubing and a big roll of cheesecloth.
Why didn't you say this while you were bossing us around, Miss Pioneer Dope?
Things were going so well and everybody was paying attention.
I just kind of got caught up in the moment.
But it's Ionely at the top.
I don't want to be leader any more.
I nominate Dorothy.
What are you going to do?
My first official act is to banish you from my kingdom.
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
I know you meant well.
I'm not crying about the comment.
I'm crying because we're dying and I've so many things to tell you.
- Like what?
- Like once I read your diary.
You what?
It was an accident.
You left it open.
I was 20 pages in before I realized it wasn't a Sidney Sheldon novel.
Rose Nylund, I want you out of my house this instant.
Blanche.
I'll never speak to you again as long as I live.
And since we have no water, that means about another 48 hours.
Since we're gonna die anyway, I might as well be honest, too.
Rose.
I slept with your cross-eyed cousin Nolan when he visited us from Ohio.
And he was lousy in bed.
I knew about that a long time ago.
Nolan told me.
He said you were the one that was lousy.
Take that back.
- Won't.
- Will.
Let's examine our priorities.
We have no food, water or shelter.
Besides, I also slept with Nolan on that fateful trip.
And as your leader, I must decree that the fault indeed lies with Nolan.
Well, since we're being honest, Dorothy, I have a question for you.
You're supposed to be my best friend.
Best friends should be able to confide in one another.
How come I overheard you on the telephone telling Anita I had my tubes tied?
I said you'd bought a tube top.
When did you have your tubes tied?
I didn't.
If I had, it'd have been when you had your nose done.
I never had my nose done.
Rose is the one who had it done.
Whoops.
Sorry, Rose.
I don't believe you two kept that secret from me.
Why didn't you tell me?
You're always so critical about those kinds of things.
I am not.
How much did it cost you?
- $ 700.
- Boy, you were gypped.
You see?
That's exactly why Rose didn't want to tell you.
You are overly critical.
That's what I like least about you.
You know what I like least about you?
You are overbearing.
Know what I like least about you both?
- You always tell me what to do.
- Shut up.
Will somebody say, "I'm sorry" before I burst?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry and if I die, I'm glad I'm with my two best friends.
- I love you.
- I love you.
And I love both of you.
I'm just so full of love, I have to let it out.
I'd like to teach the world to sing in perfect harmony We'd like to hold it in our arms and keep it company How about a mai tai?
Where have you been?
Rose said there might be a waterfall.
You were right.
There is a waterfall.
And it empties into a pool in the lobby of the Hyatt Regency.
We never left the island.
We got shipwrecked on the good side.
Our new hotel is half a mile this way.
We reserved you a room.
Put out the fire.
Ladies, as long as we're not going to die, I suggest everything we said won't go further than us three.
In the scouts we made it official by pricking our fingers with a penknife and taking a blood oath.
- What do you say?
- Shut up, Rose.
I sure am glad everything's back to normal.
I'd like to teach the world to sing in perfect harmony I'd like to hold it in my arms
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
I'll set these down and show you through the house.
You didn't have to wait outside.
Come in.
It's OK, fella.
I don't mind if I do.
Nice place you got here.
Well, thank you.
Can I offer you something?
Coffee?
Tea?
Scraps from last night's dinner?
Oh, you're pulling my tail.
Aren't you a little old for imaginary friends?
Sophia, I wasn't talking to myself.
I was talking to the dog.
My Auntie Bet talked to woodpeckers.
He's adorable.
I found him at the market.
I'll keep him till I find his owner.
Find his owner before Dorothy gets home.
She hates dogs.
Hello.
Oh, well, look at the cute little puppy dog.
Hello there, honey.
He likes me.
He must be a male.
Then you don't mind if he stays till I find his owner?
Mind?
Of course I mind.
You can't keep that filthy beast in my house.
But you said he was cute.
He is.
But a dog belongs outdoors in his natural habitat where he's free to roam and lick himself in the privacy of his doghouse.
He won't be any trouble.
I'll keep him in my room.
You won't know he's here.
OK, but we're not the only ones living here.
Dorothy has to agree, too.
- Thanks, Blanche.
- If he lifts his leg, I'll rub your nose in it.
That seems fair.
Bye, Auntie Blanche.
Bye, Auntie Sophia.
She gets away with it.
If she was my age she'd be locked up making boats out of sticks.
I've had it.
I've just had it.
In the past few days I've been turned down for every available part-time job in Dade County that didn't involved selling cocaine.
Oh, Dorothy, it's just so unfair.
They shouldn't do this to a fine teacher like you.
It's part of the experimental year-round school system.
Every teacher is required to take a ten-week leave and my ten weeks are now.
You should've taken the job I suggested.
Ma, you wanted me to be a nun.
It's steady work, they supply the uniform and you're married to God.
At least he's home every night.
Maybe it's time you reconsidered working at the museum with me.
Come on, we've had that conversation.
All I know about museums is not to eat the veal in the cafeteria.
You can't find a job and you need the money.
It might be fun working together.
- Well - I won't take no for an answer.
I'll set up an interview with Mr Allen tomorrow.
What was that?
Rose found a dog at the supermarket.
Couldn't she get stew meat like she usually does?
Dorothy, don't be upset.
The poor thing was lost.
He followed me home.
You drive to the market.
Did he follow you in a taxi?
He looked so hungry and sad.
I couldn't just leave him.
I hunted hours for his owner.
I hate dogs, Rose.
Dorothy, come on.
Nobody hates dogs.
Please, just for the night.
I promise.
Please, Auntie Dorothy.
I won't be any trouble.
Please.
All right.
But just for the night.
Thank you, Auntie Dorothy.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Well, do you believe this?
I saw her lips move.
I took several art courses in college and I've also substituted in art appreciation classes in the public school system.
Mr Allen, Dorothy was telling you about her background.
I'm sorry, I'm distracted.
It's not every day you find your friend in bed with your wife.
I'm so sorry.
That must have been quite a shock.
It was.
Arthur's never come home at lunch before.
He caught me red-handed.
- Now, where were we?
- We were talking about art.
The thing we hang on the wall here.
- What about it?
- Dorothy knows a lot about it.
She studied in Rome and lectured in Paris and she has a very keen eye for colour and light and form.
She's always the first one to compliment me on my wardrobe.
- Blanche thinks highly of you.
- She's taking my résumé to the Vatican this afternoon.
Pardon?
That's just a little joke to ease the tension of the moment.
Right.
I tried to think of something funny to say when Art walked in.
But standing there in my shorts, nothing came to mind.
Mr Allen.
- Does Dorothy get the job?
- Sure.
I don't care.
Thank you, Mr Allen.
I hope I live up to your expectations.
Come on, sweetheart.
That's a boy.
Dorothy, why are you up so early?
Never mind.
It's over a week.
Why is that mutt still here?
I promised to take him to the pound, but he wasn't well.
- I'm a little worried.
- Don't be, it was a hangover.
- What?
- A hangover from the sherry.
Ma, you gave the dog sherry?
That's terrible.
I was having a few sips while I rinsed out my underwear.
It's a little thing I do Mondays and Thursdays.
Anyway, the dog walks in, looks at me, and it's your Uncle Aldo's face begging for a drink.
I give him a swallow, but he doesn't know when to stop, also like Aldo.
We sing some Puccini, stretch out on the couch and take a nap.
All in all, a pleasant afternoon.
Rose, the dog is drooling on my foot.
You say that like it's a bad thing.
Rose, we had an agreement.
You said the dog would be gone by now.
Just one more day, Dorothy.
I'll find the owner.
I have posters all over the neighbourhood.
One more day or I'll get rid of the dog myself.
I'll take him out to the lanai.
Come on, sweetheart.
Auntie Dorothy.
Lighten up.
- Morning.
- Morning, Auntie Blanche.
- The pup's still here.
- Yeah.
One more day, unless Ma takes him bar hopping.
How come you're dressed so early?
I told Mr Allen I'd come in early to get the press list information ready before lunch.
You're such a treasure.
I hope he appreciates you.
After only a week you know as much about that museum as I do.
What's to know?
Bang in a nail, hang a picture.
Any idiot could do that.
Stop bragging.
You're only saying that cos I'm your daughter.
I'm very proud of the job you're doing, Dorothy.
Hello?
Just a minute.
Mr Allen on the phone.
He's never called me at home before.
And he's not now.
It's for Dorothy.
Thank you.
Good morning, Mr Allen.
Well, thank you.
Thank you, yeah.
Well, thank you very much.
Very sweet of you to call.
Yes.
Thank you so much.
I'll see you later.
Bye-bye.
- What did he want?
- To thank me for my work on the Hotchkiss project.
That's lovely.
Just lovely.
Especially since there wasn't that much work involved.
Ma, it's 8 a.m. What are you doing with the sherry?
I'm not gonna drink it.
I was hiding it from the dog.
Ma, you expect me to believe that?
Promise me you won't drive.
Dorothy, look who I found.
- Ma.
What are you doing here?
- You left your lunch at home.
Thanks.
You didn't have to come.
Good excuse to put my teeth in.
While you're here, would you like a tour?
No.
If I want to look at pictures, I go to FotoMatt.
Rose brought me.
She's outside with the dog.
You ever stick your head out of a car window doing 50?
What a rush.
Hello.
And who do we have here?
This is my mother Sophia Petrillo.
Ma, this is my boss Mr Allen.
Pleased to meet you, Mrs Petrillo.
What brings you to our humble home?
Is he gay?
Come on, I'll walk you to the car.
Goodbye.
Sorry you didn't have an opportunity to experience our museum.
I'd love for you to see my most prized acquisition.
A magnificent pair of Gauguins.
What are you, a pervert?
I was married 45 years.
I never even saw my husband's Gauguins.
I forgot why I came to talk to you.
About the banquet.
Don't you worry about a thing.
I love to throw a party.
Leave it to me.
Actually, I've decided to leave everything to Dorothy.
- Excuse me?
- I've put Dorothy in charge of the arrangements for the banquet.
You won't have to do a thing.
You'll have your time free to devote to the exhibition.
But, Mr Allen, I'd always assumed that I was gonna handle it.
You were, but that was before we found Dorothy.
Tell her I want to see her.
Hello.
Dorothy isn't here.
She was arrested on a morals charge this morning.
You never know, do you?
Have a nice day.
Ma, gimme a break.
The Di-Gel's on the bottom shelf.
You.
Come on.
That does it.
Come on, out.
Come on.
Out.
Move it.
Out.
Right now.
Come on, now, this isn't fair.
Come on.
I'm not falling for those big sad eyes and floppy ears and wet nose.
The last time I did, it ended in divorce.
Stan couldn't even catch a Frisbee in his teeth.
Listen.
Honey, it's not a personal thing.
I don't hate you.
As a matter of fact, I once had a dog.
A schnauzer name Wa-Wa.
Yeah, well, I know that sounds strange, but my daughter was only two when she named him during a walk.
And I figured between that and Number One, Wa-Wa was the hands-down winner.
He was the greatest dog in the world.
Present company excluded.
I loved that dog.
He was always with me.
I thought I'd never be able to get along without him.
And one day he died.
I cried for a week.
And I decided then I would never ever go through that again.
So, you see, it's not My God.
I've spilled my guts to someone who drinks out of a toilet.
Listen, I'm sorry, you are out of here.
One Wa-Wa in my life was enough.
Look, I've had it with that disgusting dog.
I've tolerated him as long as I can.
- He's got to go.
- But, Dorothy - No "buts", Rose.
- OK, I'll need a few more days.
A few more days and that is it.
Get me a doggie bone.
I don't know.
I don't think you deserve one.
Not for me.
It's to lure that mutt out of my room.
That's OK.
I'll get him out.
Aunt Dorothy's certainly a grouch.
You couldn't sleep either, huh?
No, I guess it's the knife in my back.
Come again?
I wasn't going to mention this, but I won't be able to sleep until I do.
You have backed me into a corner.
When that happens, I come out fighting like a wild cat.
Unless I'm drunk.
I slide down the wall and make passionate love on the carpet.
Blanche, what the hell are you talking about?
You stole the banquet of the only art show I've ever put together.
I did not steal your banquet.
Mr Allen assigned it to me.
Why?
Why give it to you and not to me?
I've been working there for five years.
I'm the one who's been wearing low-cut blouses and picking up pencils off the floor.
I'm the one he always gropes at the Christmas party.
And they picked Sandra Day O'Connor over you?
I'm not taking this sitting down.
When it comes to art, you cannot hold a candle to me.
Give me back my banquet before you mess it up.
Listen, Mr Allen gave me that banquet and I'll take charge of it, regardless of your childish insecurities.
- Who are you calling childish?
- Who did you call back-stabber?
Girls, this little fella better stick around a while.
- Get rid of him.
- He's ill.
Who cares?
Don't explain, Rose.
I lived with some bitches myself.
- Dorothy, is Blanche around?
- She hasn't come in yet.
Good, we can talk about the banquet.
- How's everything going?
- She doesn't suspect a thing.
I can't wait to see her face when she sees the banquet is to honour her good work.
- I can't either.
- I'll finish my speech for Blanche.
When it's done, would you look at it?
I'd be happy to, Mr Allen.
Be happy to, Mr Allen.
My, aren't we licking boots a little early?
I had a light breakfast.
- Here's your mail.
- Why not tell me what's in it?
What?
Haven't you already steamed it open?
Please, I have a lot of work to get done before lunch.
Don't let little ineffectual, insignificant me - get between you and your work.
- Thank you.
I wouldn't want to come between your lips and Mr Allen's behind.
Blanche, that does it, I have had it.
Up until we started working together, you were my best friend.
We were good friends because you trusted me.
Now you think I'm some other person, someone who'd stab you in the back.
I am not that person.
Blanche, I am still your best friend, whether or not you think so.
Dorothy, I I've been acting like such a fool.
I don't know what in the hell got into me.
I know you'd never hide anything behind my back.
Please forgive me, Dorothy.
Please, Dorothy.
Please.
You really hurt my feelings.
I I don't know.
Please.
This is tearing me up.
I'm a mess.
You can't tell from the way I look, but it's true.
OK, Blanche.
I forgive you.
Dorothy, I've got the thing I want you to look over.
The thing.
I'll look at it later.
So, where would you like to have lunch?
How about that new pizza place on the corner?
- Great.
- Dorothy.
Yes?
What was that thing Mr Allen just gave you?
- What thing?
- That thing in your drawer.
That thing.
- It's nothing.
- If it's nothing, let me see it.
I am really hungry.
Let's go out and get that pizza now.
It's 9.15.
I don't want pizza, I want to see that.
- I'm sorry, Blanche, you can't.
- Why?
- Because.
- Why?
Because it's none of your business.
None of my business?
I will have you know that before you came here, everything was my business.
- Show me that paper.
- I'm sorry, Blanche, I can't.
I knew you'd been hiding something.
You no-good, back-stabbing jezebel.
I demand you show me that paper.
I'm sorry, flattery won't work.
I'll tell you what won't work.
You and me in the same office.
Stealing that banquet was bad enough, but hiding things is going too far.
If you want this job that bad that you have to lie, you can have it.
I quit.
Gin.
- Aren't you gonna get mad?
- No.
Want to play again?
Nah.
If you don't get mad, it's no fun.
- You still upset about Blanche?
- Yes, Ma.
Tell her that cockamamie banquet is for her.
I can't, I was sworn to secrecy.
- Hi, Blanche.
- Eat dirt and die, trash.
Just hold it right there, Blanche.
You stay out of this, Ma.
That banquet you're mad about is in your honour.
- What?
- I told you, it was a secret.
Your secret, not mine.
- Is this true?
- Yes, it is.
Now you feel like the dirt you wanted her to eat, I think I'll have a hard candy.
Dorothy, I I don't know what to say.
- I understand, Blanche.
- Oh, no, you don't.
See, I thought I was a miracle worker, that nobody could do what I do at the museum.
Then you came and learned my job in a week and I realised any idiot can do it.
And you were afraid you couldn't find the right words to apologise.
There are no right words, Dorothy.
Words cannot begin to ease the pain I've inflicted on you.
But I want to make it up to you.
I want to give you something personal, something from the heart.
The most beautiful thing I own, to the most beautiful person I know.
I guess that would be my emerald earrings.
I'm sure as hell not gonna give you those.
But I want to give you something.
Something personal.
I know, how about a personal cheque for $ 75?
On the bottom I'll write, "I was a big fat jerk".
Blanche, I don't want your cheque I am trying to find some way to tell you I'm sorry.
OK, I'll take it but I won't cash it.
I'll keep it as a reminder for the next time you behave like a big fat jerk.
OK.
Will you be able to pretend to be surprised at that banquet?
Of course.
I've pretended to be a virgin enough times.
Girls, I've got great news.
I found the dog's owner.
How did you know?
He recognised the picture.
And the dog came to him when he called.
That's wonderful.
I'm so glad he found his owner.
Dorothy, why, are you crying?
No, I just have something in my eye.
That's dog love in your eyes.
All right, I admit it.
I love dogs.
It just breaks my heart that that dog is gone.
I felt the same when I dropped him off.
That's why I stopped at the animal shelter.
Come on in, guys.
Come on, guys.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Sophia.
Your card game run late?
They changed the route on the number 10 bus.
Didn't put up a sign.
Where did you end up?
Who knows?
Only one person spoke English, and he blamed me for the Bay of Pigs.
- How did you get home?
- On another bus.
But they'd changed the name of the number 10 to number 7.
I'm gonna write David Horowitz.
Sophia, I think you got on the wrong bus.
Maybe, but I'm gonna write Horowitz, anyway.
I want someone to arrest David Harper's dentist.
Rose, I have a date.
Do you plan to use your silver bracelet?
I plan to spend the evening reorganizing my recipe file.
Are you dressing for that, or can I borrow the bracelet?
- All yours.
- Thank you.
I'm borrowing your pearl earrings.
What if I'm using them?
Honey, I would be so happy for you.
But you don't have a date.
The only woman who went without male companionship longer than you was Heather Swain, who went to the sanatorium for what Reverend Samuels said was the croup, but which all Mayflower County knew was a social disease.
Congratulations, Rose.
A new record.
And you've done it without needing penicillin.
Now, Rose knows I don't mean anything.
Don't you?
We all have our dry spells.
You can borrow the earrings, Blanche.
I'm not going anywhere.
And keep them till I do need them.
Come on, Rose.
Don't let this bother you.
You'll date again.
Of course.
Honey, have you given any thought to advertising?
Blanche.
I could never dress the way you do.
Besides, I have to wear undies.
Not all my wool skirts are lined.
That's not what I meant.
Blanche, do you mean like a personals column?
- Yeah.
- That's a great idea.
- I don't know.
- What do you have to lose?
If you don't find anyone interesting, you don't have to reply.
And the Community Centre runs their service in the newsletter for free.
And they'll even run your picture, and let you use a 100-word biography.
- How do you know that?
- Rumour.
I could try it, but I could never go out with a man I met that way.
Honey, desperate times call for desperate measures.
Blanche, I'm not the only woman in Miami without a date.
Rose, I need to borrow a silk scarf tonight.
You have a date?
No, I'm doing the Dance of the Seven Veils, and I'm one short.
Sometimes I worry about her.
Girls, was this the only mail today?
Yes, People magazine is late again.
I have to give that mailman another talking-to.
This time, try something a little more forceful than asking him in for a Café Vienna and a warm bath.
Dorothy, the man had just recovered from a hernia operation, and he was having trouble carrying his sack.
I can't believe the response to my personal ad.
It's terrible.
- No-one interested?
- No.
Two weeks, not one letter.
Hi, Sophia.
Do any of you see a fedora in the window?
- I don't.
- Good.
I lost him.
- Lost who?
- A guy who keeps following me.
He's English.
I met him at the Centre.
He's got the hots for me.
As much as an English guy can get the hots.
Sophia gets chased, and I don't even get a letter.
- You can have Willy.
- What's wrong with him?
There's nothing wrong with him.
OK, so he's 90.
He has a tom-turkey profile, and his butt hits his heels.
He thinks he can pull it off by wearing a jaunty cap.
He sounds kinda cute, Ma.
Why are you avoiding him?
There's no magic, Dorothy.
No sparks.
You know?
He's 90; you're 80.
Sparks are dangerous.
I know.
I wouldn't date a man unless I felt sparks.
Well, fortunately, you carry flints in your bra.
I can't believe I'm listening to a discussion about Sophia's love life.
Hook up with Willy.
He needs to forget me.
- No, thank you.
- You don't know what you're missing.
There aren't many guys who remember where they were when the Archduke Ferdinand was shot.
Rose, don't let this personals thing depress you.
I can't help it.
I haven't been this depressed since I was rejected by Uncle Sam.
Honey, if he was your uncle, it wasn't meant to be.
It's not like he was your cousin.
That relationship might have a future.
Tell me, Blanche.
Did any of your relatives appear in Deliverance?
It was during the Korean conflict.
I was rejected as a WAC.
I failed the ink-blot test.
Rose, how can you fail an ink-blot test?
I didn't know you couldn't cut them out.
I never felt so rejected in my life.
Until now.
Boy, this personals idea was really a mistake.
- Is there something we can do?
- We've done enough.
I know.
I'll set her up with one of my discards, Henry Barnes.
He's reasonably good-Iooking; he drives a new Buick Riviera; and I heard he just opened a third dry-cleaning store.
- Blanche, where are you going?
- To call him.
I'm free tonight.
- And Rose?
- She can call Bud Needham.
Who's he?
He just took Henry's place in my discard pile.
So, tell Jackie you'd prefer Marla to do your hair.
I can't.
Jackie and I go way back, before bouffant.
- You're practically family.
- I know.
So, I'll take Marla, and you take Jackie.
But Jackie makes you look like a chicken.
But with your nose, it could work.
You'll never believe what happened.
I got a response from my personal ad.
- You're kidding.
- And it's the sweetest letter.
He apologises for waiting so long to respond.
He says he's shy about meeting someone through personals.
We have so much in common.
We both love all dairy foods, and we both requested to stand with Bert Parks in Hands Across America.
- He sounds very nice.
- Will you go out with him?
I couldn't go out with him.
That was an experiment.
But the letter's so sweet I'm going to write and tell him how I appreciate it.
Isn't it nice to see Rose feeling so good about herself?
This is the first time I've seen her smile since all this started.
Dorothy, I have a confession to make.
I wrote that letter to Rose.
What?
I wrote that letter myself.
I made up a name and answered Rose's ad.
Blanche, how could you?
She thinks someone took an interest in her.
Someone did.
Me.
But what if she expects another letter or decides to go out with him?
We just write one last farewell letter, before he moves to Saskatchewan, and that's the end of Isaac Newton.
Isaac Newton?
The first name that came to mind.
Isaac Newton was the first name that came to mind?
Actually, Ted Koppel was the first name that came to mind.
But he looks like Howdy Doody's illegitimate son.
Gin.
- He could end it with a poem.
- He did last time.
No, he wrote a poem three letters ago.
He doesn't write poems, Blanche.
We write poems.
Lord Byron writes poems.
We just copy them onto loose-leaf paper.
In cleverly disguised handwriting, I might add.
Why did I agree to do this?
We have to tell Rose the truth.
No, it would crush her.
Then we ship Isaac Newton to Saskatchewan.
You can't send a citrus farmer to Saskatchewan.
How's he going to live?
Excuse me.
Next time we invent a person, let's make sure that he has a trade that travels.
Besides, I'm kind of proud of Isaac.
I'd hate to see him go, myself.
We have created a poetry-writing citrus farmer, who writes letters with a lavender felt pen.
And Rose thinks he's fascinating.
Now, what do you think that says?
- About Rose?
- About the whole bunch of us.
Dorothy, I got a big problem.
The Metamucil's in the top cabinet.
I mean the Cheswick dude.
I explained to him that at 90 there would never be anything between us.
- What did he say?
- "Not never, but with a little luck every six weeks".
I'm glad everybody's still up.
I just had a terrific idea.
What?
I've been reading and re-reading Isaac's letters, and I've decided to tell him I want to meet.
But you said you wouldn't.
Only 'cause I never believed I'd find such a special man.
What makes you think he's special?
I mean, you hardly know him.
I suppose, but it feels like I've known him for ages, and that he's known me.
I've found the most wonderful man, and I owe it all to the two of you.
How do you spell Saskatchewan?
- Ma, have you seen my watch?
- Here.
I borrowed it.
I wanted it tonight.
Can't you ask?
And disturb you while you're taming your cowlick?
It's silly to take three cars to this reception.
Four couples can fit into two.
Fine with me, and Howard won't mind.
Ma, bring your date with us.
What date?
Willy scared off all the eligible men at the Centre.
Blanche, can I borrow my earrings?
Sure, and bring your cousin with us.
- I'm not taking him.
- Why not?
You have no date.
I don't, either.
We can sit by the sweet table and guess people's weight.
I have a date, but not Cousin Arnold.
Good.
I never liked your cousin Arnold.
You have a date?
Anyone we know?
Isaac.
- Excuse me?
- Isaac, from the personals.
- You're not serious?
- Sure I am.
Before I could write and suggest we meet, I got a letter from him, saying he was moving to Saskatchewan.
To be the Smudge Pot Supervisor of the first domed orange grove in Canada.
Anyway, he's leaving Tuesday, so there's no time to waste.
We shouldn't have done this.
I looked through all the phone books, and there was only one listing for Isaac Q Newton.
I called him and invited him to the reception.
He should be here any minute.
Are you saying you got your date from the phone book?
It's not like the Yellow Pages.
It's not like I don't know him.
Rose, exactly what did he say when you called him?
I was pretty nervous, so I didn't give him much chance to say anything.
- He accepted your invitation?
- I told him he had to.
I'd better finish getting ready.
Blanche, could I borrow my beaded purse?
Yeah, sure, honey.
Dorothy, what are we going to do?
We can't let Rose meet someone who said yes to a woman who'd picked his name from a book.
You say that like nobody ever does it.
Besides, it's just for this one date.
- After that he leaves for Saskatchewan.
- He doesn't.
We made that up.
Alright.
Well if he's wonderful, we'd have ruined her evening for nothing.
Let's meet him.
He might be Rose's dream come true.
So much for that theory.
Good evening.
Wilfred Whitney Cheswick here.
Might this be the home of the widow Petrillo?
- There you are, Sophia.
- Willy, what are you doing?
I've come to escort you to the reception, and I won't take no for an answer.
Yeah?
Take this for an answer.
Ma.
Alright, Cheswick.
You might as well make use of that monkey suit.
But if anybody cute asks me to dance, make yourself scarce.
Once I have you in my arms on that dance floor, Sophia, you won't so much as glance at another man.
Dream on, Piccadilly.
Come on, Blanche.
Let's go confess to Rose and beg her forgiveness.
- Hi.
Rose?
- No, I'm Dorothy.
- Hi.
Rose?
- Blanche.
You're Isaac Newton?
Yes.
I bet you take a lot of kidding about that.
About what?
Rose should be ready any moment.
Just make yourself comfortable.
No, I couldn't.
I'm never comfortable.
You can't tell because my arms are lowered, but I've nearly sweated through this suit.
I guess Rose forgot to mention the reception tonight's black-tie.
I have it in my pocket.
I'll bet you were surprised when Rose called you up suddenly and invited you out.
Yes, I was.
I don't date very much.
I mean, I try.
I took a lot of ribbing at the boarding house this evening.
Hi.
I'm ready.
Rose, this is Isaac.
You're really beautiful.
Thank you, Isaac.
Rose, we have to talk to you.
- That's a very nice dress.
- Thank you.
I've worn it once before.
But the pantyhose are new.
Rose, if Blanche and I could see you outside for a moment.
If I may be so bold, the pantyhose are nice, too.
At least the hose part.
I'm so happy to finally meet you, Isaac.
You two just run along, and we'll catch up.
- Blanche.
- Something is happening here.
Yes, it's the beginning of a disaster.
No, everything could turn out fine.
Can I get you something before we go?
Coffee?
Tea?
A dairy product?
Cheese would be nice.
Tends to calm my nerves.
Thank you, sweet Jesus.
It's a miracle.
Howard, could you get me another champagne?
- Roger, be a dear.
- I haven't seen them anywhere.
Oh, my God.
What if he's a depraved ex-convict who's kidnapped Rose, and taken her on a rampage of violence and destruction unparalleled in the annals of modern crime?
Then we probably should have told her about the letters.
- I think you're right.
- Let's see if we can find them.
Being Vice-Principal of a junior high school isn't as glamorous as it was.
I still get to keep all the Chocolate Clusters from the new band uniform drive, and I am the adviser to the French Club.
But for 15 years I've been asking myself, "Is that enough"?
And a week ago I answered with a big fat "no".
Good for you.
It takes a special man to talk to himself like that.
Well, merci.
That's French for "thank you".
That's when I decided it's about time I fulfilled my lifelong dream to join those men who soar above the earth.
You want to be an astronaut?
No, I couldn't go to the bathroom in my suit.
I want to be a traffic reporter.
I want the name Isaac Newton to be remembered.
You're remarkable, Isaac.
All this and citrus farming, too.
Hello there.
Girls, isn't it a wonderful party?
- Glorious.
- You two having a good time?
My only regret is not calling Isaac sooner.
That would have been hard.
Mom only just gave me my own phone.
Don't be too tough on her.
Look how great you turned out.
- Merci.
- Could we have some champagne?
Is that the stuff in the bottle or the bowl?
Never mind.
I'll figure it out.
Rose, we have to talk.
I want to talk to you.
Isaac is so shy.
He won't discuss anything about his letters.
- Rose, we really - Listen.
I guess I shouldn't push it.
If he wants to hide his romantic side because it embarrasses him, fine.
But why won't he explain how his smudge pot works?
- Look, Rose.
- Here we are, ladies.
- Two champagnes.
- Thank you.
There's a dance floor in the garden area.
I know you love to dance.
I do?
Then, let's have at it.
- See what I mean?
- Listen, Rose.
We'll be back in just a little while.
You can't get rid of me, Sophia.
I won't give up until I make you mine.
Here.
Hold this.
I know what you're thinking.
That I'm only after your money.
But I love you from the depths of my soul.
The fact that you're a wealthy widow only makes me want to protect you, not to take advantage of you.
Whoa, Willy.
You got your brains in your ascot?
Why do you think I'm wealthy?
- RJ Jolonoux.
- Yes, so he'd take me to bingo.
- You aren't a wealthy widow?
- I barely have a bank account.
My regards to your lovely family.
Don't get upset.
I told you I couldn't dance.
- Your letter said you loved to.
- Howard.
- What is this letter?
- I don't mean one letter.
- Rose.
- I mean all the letters.
- You mean the alphabet?
- Didn't you mean any of it?
This was all your idea of a joke.
No, no, I swear.
I have no sense of humour.
Rose, listen to us.
Rose, we're the ones who wrote those letters.
- What?
- We wanted to cheer you up.
And we couldn't find the right moment to tell you about it.
We're so sorry.
I'm glad you straightened that out.
I was beginning to remember writing those letters.
I know I saw her come in.
Rose?
Honey, are you in there?
Rose, please come out and talk to us.
Go away.
I'm not talking to you again.
Look, Rose, you have every right to be angry.
What we did was inexcusable.
But let us try to explain why we did it.
- No.
Leave me alone.
- We'll just be a second.
Rose, we are not leaving until we talk, even if it takes all night.
How could you do this?
Aren't you my friends?
We are, Rose, and what we did we did out of friendship.
Friendship?
You made me look like a fool.
I wondered where they moved the party to.
Isaac, this is where ladies go to the bathroom.
How do you lift this baby up?
Isaac, later.
I guess you have to stand back when you flush this thing.
Rose.
Rose, honey, please come out.
We've already told you how sorry we are.
I mean, we never expected this to go so far.
But that wasn't the worst part.
The worst part was making me believe that somebody felt those special things about me.
Somebody wanted to hear why sometimes I hate my job, or like to eat my lunch in the park.
It was so nice.
It was so important to me that someone cared about me as much as the person who wrote those letters.
It meant so much to have somebody like that in my life.
You do, Rose, honey.
You have us.
We're the ones who wrote those letters, Rose, and we meant every word.
It was still a pretty crazy thing to do, but at least you did it because you cared about me.
OK, let's get back to our dates.
I want Howard to get me tipsy and take advantage of me.
Blanche.
Howard's my date.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Rose?
Dorothy?
Sophia?
The coast is clear.
Come on in, Ed.
My roommates are out shopping, so we have the place to ourselves.
It's time to find out who's naughty or nice.
Didn't you have the best time Christmas shopping, Dorothy?
I loved it.
Being pushed and shoved all day to buy gifts I can't afford.
It's a regular Yuletide treat.
- You've been grouchy all day.
- I'm sorry, Rose.
I'm sad because Christmas doesn't have a meaning anymore.
It's so commercial.
How can you say that?
The three wise men in Burdines' nativity scene were wearing Ralph Lauren ski parkas.
Catch me, catch me, catch me.
Let me take a wild guess.
You didn't expect us home this early.
- I'd like you to meet - We know who he is, Blanche.
Santa, how could you?
Rose, this is Ed Kletner.
He works at the mall.
He's on his break.
Santa is never off duty, mister.
In that uniform, the only thing on your mind should be giving people what they want for Christmas.
He was trying to, Rose.
I saw Blanche's list.
Get your cap, get your beard and get moving.
Rose.
I had to wait for a hour to sit on his lap.
Tough holly.
- What would Mrs Claus say?
- Not to mention Mrs Kletner.
- Who was that?
- He's a Santa Claus.
You're kidding.
I thought it was Fidel Castro.
- What was he doing here?
- Blanche picked him up at the mall.
I can't help it.
A man in a Santa Claus suit drives me absolutely crazy.
Maybe it's the warmth of all that red, hot, sweaty flannel.
Set against the austere coldness of those black patent leather jackboots.
Or maybe it's because those rosy cheeks and twinkling eyes bespeak a passion about to erupt from a man who spent a Ionely year cooped up with dwarves.
I'm not sure.
But the sight of a Santa sets my body aflame with unbridled desire.
Blanche, you do realise you're in the minority on this?
- Did you finish your shopping?
- Yeah, just about.
It's unbelievable how much things cost.
I just spent $89 for a doll for my granddaughter.
Ma, you had $89?
Don't be ridiculous.
I charged my gifts with your credit card.
You're taking them back.
Even the beautiful cashmere sweater I got for Blanche?
Cashmere?
I love cashmere.
Don't tell me.
Tell Scrooge.
Rose, I hope you didn't have your heart set on a video recorder.
You bought me a video recorder?
I bought you a video recorder.
Two video recorders?
This is going to be the best Christmas ever.
How did you think I'd pay for all this?
On time.
Loosen up the mousetrap a little.
It's Christmas.
You see what this holiday has become?
You see?
Everybody thinks you show someone you care by going into debt.
Where is the love?
Where's the sharing?
Where is the true spirit of Christmas?
Neiman Marcus, ladies' apparel, third floor.
Maybe you're right, Dorothy.
I've spent too much again this year.
Girls, I have a terrific idea.
Before we go home to spend Christmas with our families, why not have a celebration right here?
St. Olaf style.
I will not drink eggnog while wearing a cast-iron brassiere.
We don't do that at Christmas.
We do that at Easter.
At Christmas we exchange gifts we make for each other.
Rose, that is a great idea.
We'll return all those meaningless impersonal gifts that we always buy for each other and make something that comes from the heart.
- That's a terrific idea.
- What do you say, Ma?
Unless you make a lamb's-wool jacket with a fake fur collar, my heart stays with Neiman Marcus ladies' apparel, third floor.
This one's from me, Dorothy.
They're popular back home.
It took me a week to whittle it.
Rose.
- Do you like it?
- Like it?
Honey, I love it.
Who wouldn't love a wooden brooch in the shape of a turkey's head?
No, that's a maple syrup spigot.
You know what she took back?
Pearl earrings.
- The ones I fell in love with?
- Yep.
Ho, ho, ho.
Ma.
Who cares?
Rose, I love it.
This'll come in a lot handier than pearl earrings, when I'm lost in the woods with a stack of pancakes.
Dorothy.
I wanna give you all my gift next.
I thought this was such a cute idea, I made the same for each of you.
Here.
Sophia.
"The Men Of Blanche's Boudoir".
It's a calendar.
Each month has the picture of a man who's brought some special joy into my life.
Blanche.
Honey.
This is so thoughtful.
- September?
- Yep.
I'm surprised you could walk in October.
Just think, girls, tomorrow's Christmas Eve, and we'll be back home with our families.
There's nothing like Christmas in Minnesota.
Unless it's Christmas in New York.
A light snow falling over Fifth Avenue, ice skaters at Rockefeller Center, Santas on every street corner.
Really?
I guess my very favourite Christmas ever was in New York.
It was Christmas, 1932.
You remember, Ma?
Do I remember?
No.
My family doesn't stay in touch during the year, but come Christmas we all manage to make it back home.
I guess that's what Christmas is all about.
- I'm looking forward to it.
- I guess we all are.
We should get some rest.
We have a big day tomorrow.
I have to work in the morning.
Can you girls pick me up?
No problem, honey.
Coming to bed, Ma?
I thought I'd sit and look at the tree.
It sure is beautiful, isn't it?
- I think I'll keep you company.
- That's a good idea.
I hate to see a pleasant evening end.
Me too.
The first Noel The angels did say - W - Did I ever tell you about One Christmas we tried to launch a production of A Christmas Carol with an all-chicken cast.
- Look at the time.
- Is it that late?
I'm so tired.
Mr Thurber, I don't understand your problem.
Then I guess I don't have one.
Mr Thurber, this is a crisis center.
I'm a trained counsellor.
Don't be embarrassed about opening up to me.
Whatever's bothering you, I know I can help you.
OK.
In the past week, I've lost my job, my wife, my girlfriend, my house, my car and all my money.
And then just today I've seriously gotten into playing with matches.
You'll have to have the professional services of Dr Escobar.
He'll be back from lunch soon.
Why don't you have a seat.
Mr Thompson.
You're next.
Excuse me.
Rose, let's go.
Ma's waiting in the car.
I'll only be a minute.
Have a seat.
Hello.
Hello.
Do you have a match?
I think so.
Let's see.
Here you go.
Thanks.
Have you ever looked at fire?
I mean, really looked at it.
It's beautiful.
It's amazing to think how much damage it could do if it fell into the wrong hands.
Rose are you going to be very much longer?
Not now, Dorothy.
This man is very down about his financial situation.
He was a principal backer of Howard The Duck.
Going somewhere for Christmas?
Yes, I'm going home to see my family.
I wish I was going somewhere for Christmas.
But my family disowned me.
They're embarrassed because I'm an artist.
What kind of artist?
An unsuccessful one.
I haven't sold a painting in a year.
I haven't eaten in a week.
I burned my brushes just to stay warm.
That must have been beautiful.
I hate to see an artist suffer.
Look here, $20.
You have Christmas dinner on me.
Go on.
I'll see you after the first of the year.
And happy New Year.
- Right, I'm ready to go.
- Thanks for the money.
- Did you give Mr Meyer money?
- Yes, he's a starving artist.
He owns the most successful wide-size shoe store in the city.
He's a pathological liar.
- I am not.
- See?
Who cares?
Come on, Rose.
We're gonna be late.
Merry Christmas.
Hello there, tall, dark and jolly.
Blanche, maybe you should talk to a counsellor, too.
Look.
Santa's come to spread some Christmas cheer.
Great.
Good luck with these Gloomy Guses.
Hold it.
No one's going anywhere.
We don't want to give you trouble.
Take our money.
I'm not here to rob anybody.
I'm Santa's helper for God's sake, give me a break.
What's this all about?
I wanted to share an old-fashioned Christmas with others.
At gunpoint?
Would you spend Christmas with me if I just asked you?
No.
Well Why would you want to spend Christmas with a bunch of total strangers?
Has to be better than spending it alone.
See, Christmas for me is Christmas has always been rotten and Ionely as long as I can remember.
I always have the Christmas spirit, but no one notices.
I never get gifts, cards, dyed eggs.
- Dyed eggs?
That's Easter.
- Another rotten holiday.
Get away from the door.
That's it.
Why don't we get this celebration on its feet?
Let's sing Christmas carols.
Does everybody know "Silent Night"?
Know it?
I wrote it.
- You did not.
- Yes, I did.
I'll prove it.
Silent night Holy night What an honour.
I want to shake your hand.
Move it.
We'll miss our plane.
What can we do?
I'll create a diversion by picking up something seductively, and you two sneak up and give him a karate chop.
Blanche, what do we look like?
Charlie's Angels?
I have been told I bear a striking resemblance to Miss Cheryl Ladd.
Although my bosoms are perkier.
Not even if you were hanging upside down on a trapeze.
Excuse me.
Did you know that that guy who wrote "Silent Night" was the original choice for Potsie on Happy Days?
How the mighty have fallen.
This place is always filled with such nice people.
Years ago, when I had a problem, coming here always used to cheer me up.
That's why I decided to spend Christmas here.
Let's get to the presents.
I brought enough for everybody.
We'll miss going home because of him.
There's nothing we can do.
OK, here's your presents.
I really hope you like them.
- We don't want your presents.
- But it's Christmas.
- Not for us.
You've ruined it.
- Rose.
I'll handle this, Dorothy.
I'm not surprised that you spend Christmas by yourself.
You know why?
You don't know what Christmas is all about.
People don't owe you a nice Christmas because you decided that's what makes you happy.
You can force us to stay here all night, but I'll be damned if you'll force us to celebrate this joyous holiday with you.
I've been sitting in the car for half an hour.
What am I, a dachshund?
Ma, be careful.
He has a gun.
This is a toy.
He has been holding us hostage with a toy gun?
I can't believe it.
Dorothy, you call yourself an Italian?
You can't tell the difference between a toy and a real piece?
I feel so ashamed.
Everything you said about me is true.
I'm a loser.
You're not a loser, you just need some help.
Maybe you're right.
Mrs Nylund, a lot of what you said applies to me, too.
My whole life has been one lie after another.
I realise now I was doing it just to get attention.
I think it's time for me to stop.
Mr Meyer, that's wonderful.
Marvellous.
Let's go.
I could've walked to New York by now.
Dr Escobar, I'm so glad you're here.
I don't have time to explain, but this gentleman would like to talk to you.
Merry Christmas.
Dr Escobar?
We should talk, too.
Dr Rooney from the Mayo Clinic.
I'll fill you in on the particulars of this case.
Good Lord, we made it.
Girls, I don't know what to say.
Say goodbye.
Our plane leaves in five minutes.
Goodbye.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas, Sophia.
Have a wonderful time.
- Bye-bye.
- I'll miss you like crazy.
Bye.
Merry Christmas.
Bye.
Ladies and gentlemen, due to the severe storm front in the area, all flights in and out of Miami International Airport have been cancelled until 6am tomorrow.
Have a merry Christmas.
Excuse me.
Would you like to buy a flower?
Beat it, chrome dome!
And while you're at it, get a job, get a suit, get on your knees and beg your mother's forgiveness.
I am chilled to the bone.
I've never seen it this cold in Miami.
That storm is getting worse.
It was at its worst when we ran out of gas and had to run two blocks in the rain.
I appreciate everyone leaving me stranded after my heel fell off at that intersection.
Good evening, ladies.
Welcome to Albert's Diner.
- I'm Albert.
Merry Christmas.
- Thank you.
- Just a cup of coffee, please.
- Sure.
Coffee all around?
I'd like hot apple cider with a cinnamon stick.
Lady, does this look like Knott's Berry Farm?
- Coffee'll be fine.
- Coffee.
I ever tell you I met my husband George on Christmas Eve?
Blanche, how exciting.
Let me tell you how exciting a Christmas Eve can be.
I was home on Christmas vacation when my best friend fixed me up with the most beautiful boy.
George.
No, this was Richard J. Wild.
Believe me, his name said it all.
We must have pulled over five times on our way to that dance.
It's always best to drive defensively over the holidays.
Anyway, when we got to the dance, Richard dropped me off, and I ran smack into a man so gorgeous, he made Richard J. Wild look like a prepubescent choirboy.
- George.
- No, no, no, Ernie Willis.
Ernie smiled, and the next thing I knew, we were dancing in a local bar.
All of a sudden I heard a voice say, "May I cut in"?
It was the man I knew I'd spend my life with.
George.
No, no, Thomas Penville.
Thomas and I left the bar Blanche, I could get herpes listening to this story.
At what point in the evening did you finally meet George?
I didn't meet George until the next Christmas Eve.
That was a boring story.
I said I'd tell an exciting story.
Ladies, I hate to see people just drink coffee.
It's Christmas.
Please have some cheesecake on me.
- How very sweet of you.
- My pleasure.
I'm depressed.
I don't even want this cheesecake.
Are you ladies having a bad Christmas?
- The worst.
- I'm a little down myself.
It's tough working on Christmas Eve.
I'd like to be with my family.
We know.
We can't be with our families.
You all are not related?
- No.
- Really?
The way you were teasing and talking, I thought you were family.
Isn't that something?
Isn't it funny how sometimes it takes a total stranger to point out something that's been right there in front of your face?
We were feeling so sorry for ourselves, we forgot we are celebrating Christmas with family.
Merry Christmas, Rose.
Merry Christmas, Blanche.
Merry Christmas, Dorothy.
- Merry Christmas, Blanche.
- Merry Christmas, Rose.
What the hell is this, the Waltons?
So we're a family a family stuck in a diner on Christmas Eve.
Yeah, but at least we're together.
I know I'm feeling better.
My craving for cheesecake has returned.
Wish there was something we could do for that man.
Maybe there is.
Excuse me.
Yes, ma'am?
How would you like to go home and spend Christmas Eve with your family?
- I'd love to, but - If you trust us, we'd be happy to watch the place.
- Can you cook?
- Are you black?
I promise I'll be back in less than an hour.
- Thank you and merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
Girls, you know what this cheesecake is missing?
Chocolate syrup.
- I wonder if he has any.
- I'll look in the back.
- My God.
I don't believe it.
- What?
- Take a look.
- That's snow.
It's kinda light and whippy, but it is snow.
A white Christmas in Miami?
Can you beat that?
This calls for some Christmas music.
I pushed the wrong button.
Rose, don't worry about it.
Somehow, this Christmas it fits.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Hi, Ma.
Aren't you going to ask me why I'm sitting in the dark?
I know.
Your birthday's this weekend and you're depressed about being older.
No.
I'm depressed because you give me such lousy birthday presents.
Ma, you want better presents, adopt Monty Hall.
I wish I could.
Jewish sons are the best.
They give great gifts, always call, and you don't have to worry about them getting hurt playing sports.
Ma, trust me.
You are going to love your present.
- What is it?
- You'll find out Saturday.
I'm old.
I could die before I see it.
You'd feel terrible.
Of course I would.
I got it on sale.
I can't return it.
We just went shopping for Sophia's party.
That's what I want to talk about.
It's hard finding a present.
- What are you getting?
- I'd rather not say.
- A surprise.
- You know what it is?
That's right.
How come I don't get to know?
Rose.
How can I say this diplomatically?
You're a blabbermouth, Rose.
You're a blabbermouth.
OK, so I made one little slip.
So I told Harriet Webster you had your ears pinned back in college.
Dorothy, you had your ears pinned back.
What did they use, a big ear stapler?
OK, so I made a few little slips.
But I can keep a secret.
I'll prove it to you.
If I spill the beans, I'll give you my most prized possession.
No, Rose, I couldn't do that.
I couldn't accept your favourite album, Hans Klabnermeyer Yodels Beethoven.
Actually, I am going to tell you what I'm getting Ma, because I need your help.
Wait.
My nose.
Ma, quit listening at the door.
I'm flying my mother's sister Angela over from Sicily.
And she's bringing the surprise?
Rose, she is the surprise.
They haven't seen each other since Angela moved back to Sicily That's a wonderful surprise.
I need your help to set up the party and keep Ma out of the house while I pick up Angela.
Ma, get away from the back door.
Have you got eyes in the back of your head?
Ma, why can't you just relax and enjoy your surprise?
Because the last surprise I got was walking in on cousin Vito parading around in my girdle.
You're going to love this one, Sophia.
You know what it is?
What about the blabbermouth, does she know?
Maybe.
She knows.
Rose, after dinner, what do you say we ride over to the Dairy Queen for chocolate cones?
My treat.
With rainbow sprinkles?
They're five cents extra.
What the hell?
I'm a sport.
Are you still here?
Dorothy's due back with Angela.
Sophia keeps finding excuses not to go shopping.
I'm ready, Rose.
Sophia, what's the matter?
I saw the doctor yesterday and he I can't talk about it.
Let's go.
Wait a minute.
What is it?
You dragged it out of me.
My heart is a time bomb.
But don't be concerned.
Even though I've only made love in one position, I've led a very full life.
- Let's go.
- Wait a minute.
Isn't there something we can do?
He says any little shock or surprise and it's kaboom.
I guess all we can do is pray.
Unless you know of any surprises, Rose?
Sophia, now, you stop trying to trick Rose, just because she's weak and vulnerable and dim-witted.
Yeah.
OK, Blanche, I give up.
Rose, let's go shopping.
Sorry you got stuck shopping with me.
I realise Dorothy is forcing you.
- No, she isn't.
- Yes, she is.
She always takes terrible advantage of you, Rose.
- We should go.
- Wait.
Listen.
At the movies, who always stands in line for the popcorn?
I do.
- Who always lifts up furniture?
- I do.
When we clean the kitchen, who always mops?
- Dorothy.
- Who cleans the mop?
I do.
She takes advantage, Rose, and it's time you stood up to her.
There's no time like the present.
Speaking of presents Rose, what are you doing here?
I asked you to take Ma shopping.
Take your mop and put it where herring don't swim.
I was this close.
Dorothy, you're home.
Where's Angela?
Still out in the car.
Aunt Angela, you were supposed to wait in the car.
- Did anyone see you?
- Relax.
Somebody passed by and I made like I was a lawn jockey.
I think it worked.
His dog tried to pee on me.
Aunt Angela, please meet my dear friend Blanche.
Blanche, this is my Aunt Angela.
Pleasure to meet you.
Shall I get Angela's luggage?
- She doesn't have any luggage.
- I never travel with luggage.
Ever since I found a dead man in my suitcase.
You found a dead man in your suitcase?
Right.
Picture it.
New York City.
1956.
I was a young widow returning to Sicily.
There I was on the boat alone, watching Lady Liberty grow smaller in the distance.
When suddenly I heard a voice from the vicinity of my knees.
I looked down.
There was a midget.
It turns out that his name was Peewee Bonbunzi, and he was fleeing from the Mob.
For the next few days, we ate together, laughed together, and went for short walks in circles.
And then, one day, suddenly Peewee disappeared.
We docked in Sicily.
I was going through customs.
I noticed a strange odour coming from my suitcase.
I thought it was the veal shank I was bringing for Mother's Day.
But when the customs man opened the suitcase, there was Peewee.
Someone had stuffed him in my suitcase between the veal shank and my beaver coat.
The Mob had gotten Peewee after all.
You must have been heartbroken.
I was absolutely devastated.
I mean, first I had to burn the suitcase and then the beaver coat.
And the veal shank never did taste right.
Aunt Angela, you made that up.
I'm 80.
As long as I keep talking, I know my heart is still beating.
Angela, may I offer you something to eat?
As long as it isn't veal.
It's not because of Peewee.
I had some on the plane.
Ma, what are you doing home?
My shopping list is in the kitchen.
There you are, Sophia.
She outsmarted me, Dorothy.
You're kidding.
I mean, how is that possible?
It wasn't my fault.
We were backing down the driveway and Sophia said I ran over Mrs Stofer.
And you believed her?
I had to check.
Last week I pinned her to the fence on a right turn.
I'll get my shopping list.
I have your shopping list.
Everyone is happy with the possible exception of Mrs Stofer.
Enjoy your shopping.
Why don't I show Angela where she'll be staying?
Get yourself settled and then we'll catch up on family.
OK.
You know, Blanche here could be the identical twin of your cousin Apollonia.
Apollonia was a stunningly beautiful woman.
Thank you.
Except for that huge donkey butt.
Hi, Ma, are you having fun?
No, give me my present.
Not until after we slice my looks-like-chocolate, tastes-like-spice, you'Il-wish-you-had- a-bigger-slice marble cake.
- Know where it got its name?
- No, give me my present.
I'll go get the candles.
Rose, I've got to congratulate you.
You made it without giving away my present.
You stop trying to make me tell you.
Relax, Rose.
Dorothy already told me what it is.
- She did?
- Yeah, what a present.
Boy, was I surprised.
Dorothy, I didn't know you'd already told Sophia her surprise was Rose.
All right, Ma.
You'll get your present right now.
I give up.
You win.
You always win.
I know.
Me and Mighty Mouse.
All right, everybody, gather round.
My daughter is about to give me my big birthday surprise.
I just want to say happy birthday to my mother, whom I love very, very much.
And I just hope that you love this present as much as I love giving it to you.
OK, Blanche.
Angela?
No, Gina Lollobrigida.
This is my surprise?
Yes.
- Happy birthday, Ma.
- Happy birthday?
You call this old bag a present?
You brought me all the way from Sicily to be insulted?
I hate that woman.
I hate her double.
- Did you get 'em talking?
- Nope.
I just spent a half hour out in the hall talking to two closed doors.
Don't feel bad.
Sometimes I talk to the little pigs on my shower curtain.
I was trying to talk to my mother and Aunt Angela.
But they wouldn't talk to me or each other.
I have no idea what this is about.
There's only one thing that turns relatives into enemies.
Jealousy.
I ought to know.
You see, I was a devastatingly beautiful child.
Pink cheeks, cute little button nose, red ruby lips, adorable, little ringlet curls.
I was the tallest baby in the history of New York and had a rash on my head till I was two.
My sister Charmaine was insanely jealous of me from when I was a gorgeous little infant.
She was one year ahead and we'd compete for everything.
But there was one thing Charmaine did excel at.
Cheerleading.
Not only could she twirl that baton like a propeller, but knew every cheer in the county.
And she could twist her body into the shape of an R. Charmaine decided it was her turn in the spotlight.
She challenged me to compete against her for captain of the cheerleading squad.
We had to perform in front of the entire school, and Charmaine was fantastic.
She twirled those batons so fast, she looked like a DC3 coming in for a landing.
Then it was my turn.
So I did some cartwheels and only fell once.
I did a handstand and almost got my balance.
And I only dropped my baton four times.
And when I was finished, I was unanimously voted captain of the cheerleading squad.
Blanche, how was that possible?
Underneath my regulation uniform, I was wearing little, black French lace panties.
Bearing the words "bonjour".
Or was it "bon appétit"?
I don't remember.
Anyway, it was something in French.
I guess, nobody minded I couldn't do a handstand, but they surely did appreciate me trying.
I don't understand.
Blanche, just once, why couldn't you let your sister win?
I told you.
Jealousy is a terrible thing.
That'll teach Charmaine to be Daddy's favourite.
Girls, there is only one way we're going to solve this problem.
We have to find out what Sophia and Angela are mad about.
And then force them to settle it.
It's like that old Scandinavian saying.
"You can let two angry mackerel fight it out in a purse, but don't plan on carrying that purse to a formal affair".
It loses a little in the Translation.
But the point of it is, it's human nature to want to make up.
People stay angry out of habit.
If we can just get Angela and Sophia to talk, they'll do the rest.
- Sounds logical to me.
- To me, too.
But don't forget we're dealing with two old women who think that boils on a man are a sign of virility.
I mean, logic doesn't exactly apply here.
- At least we can give it a try.
- Rose is right.
You take Angela, we'll take Sophia.
Fine.
At this point I'll try anything.
I thought it was the size of a man's feet that were a sign of virility.
I thought it was the number of newspapers piled outside the motel room door.
Aunt Angela, please.
We have to talk.
What's to talk about?
Your mother's a stubborn old goat, who apparently pays a buck and a half to have her hair done.
- What is going on between you two?
- I don't want to talk about it.
I spent weeks working on this surprise, only to have it blow up in my face.
I deserve to know why.
OK.
OK, you want to know so bad, I'll tell you.
Picture it.
New York City.
Christmas 1955.
It's Francesca Ragouso's annual Christmas bash.
Everybody is there, eating, drinking, guzzling the Pepto-Bismol.
Francesca's a beautiful woman, but she makes a manicotti like you could anchor a boat with.
As usual Sophia's stationed at the eggnog and she's drinking right from the bowl through a swizzle stick.
My husband Carmine walks in and passes under the mistletoe.
She makes a beeline to him and gives him such a kiss she practically sucks the beard off his face.
I don't remember Uncle Carmine having a beard.
He was in a Santa suit with one of those hook-on beards.
I mean, I can't believe what I'm looking at.
I yank her into the pantry and I say, "What do you think you're doing"?
She says she thought Cunio the bookmaker was in the Santa suit.
I say, "That's a lie".
We have a big fight about it.
She denies the whole thing and we never speak again.
That was 30 years ago.
Don't you think you should talk to each other?
I won't say one word unless she apologises.
That's the only reason I came here.
Aunt Angela, please.
We're talking about family here.
Won't you try to work it out?
Do it for your favourite niece.
What's your cousin Graziella got to do with this?
Please, just do it.
Please.
Please.
- Pretty please.
- All right.
Don't beg.
You sound just like your Uncle Carmine after he'd been away on a goat drive.
- You won't tell us?
- Nope.
That's your choice, but you're making a mistake.
The same thing happened in my family once.
- My cousin Astrid - I'll tell you what happened.
Picture it.
New York City.
Christmas, 1955.
Francesca Ragouso's annual Christmas bash.
Everyone was there including the neighbourhood heartthrob Salvadore.
All the women adore Salvadore, the only guy in the room with a neck.
Anyway, I'm feeling a little queasy.
Francesca makes a great party, but she bakes a manicotti you could anchor a boat with.
So I go upstairs for a seltzer when suddenly Salvadore grabs me from behind and begins passionately kissing me.
Being a respectable married woman, I cop a few good feels.
I push him away and run back to the party.
I tell the only person in the world I trust.
My sister Angela.
Five minutes later, everybody at the party is talking about it.
I drag Angela into the pantry and ask her how she could betray her sister.
We have a big fight, she denies everything and we never speak again.
But, Sophia, honey, that was 30 years ago.
Isn't it time to forgive and forget?
Forget I do plenty.
I never forgive.
But Angela's your sister.
If she wants to talk to me, she knows where to find me.
- In the closet.
- Ma.
Angela has something she'd like to say.
So does Sophia.
Hello.
Yeah, hello.
Your hair got white.
So did yours.
You still got that cat?
The same cat I had 30 years ago?
Fine.
You ask the questions.
- Don't tell me what to do.
- Let's not lose our tempers.
If you don't apologise, why don't you leave?
- Why should I apologise?
- I'll tell you why.
You're nothing but a backstabbing Judas in sensible shoes.
You know what you are?
You're a two-lira tramp with cheap bridgework.
May you put your dentures in upside down and chew your head off.
May your legs grow old and gnarled and withered like an olive branch.
You should be so lucky.
May your moles grow hair thicker than Jerry Vale's.
May your marinara sauce never cling to your pasta.
That's it.
Come here and say that to my face.
Aunt Angela, you really don't have to go.
Dorothy, I'd like to stay, but I hate your mother.
Goodbye, ladies, and thank you for everything.
- She's still here?
- No, I left an hour ago.
- What does it look like?
- At least say goodbye.
Like civilized human beings.
That's it.
I give up.
Ma, goodbye.
Angela, let's go.
No, wait.
I have something I want to say.
When I was a little girl, there were two people I admired more than anyone else in the world.
My mother and my favourite aunt.
Now the two of you are at each other's throats and it's breaking my heart.
So my mother kissed your husband at some stupid party.
What does it matter now?
You realise that this may be the last time you two see each other ever?
Is this the way you want things left between you?
Wait.
Are you referring to Francesca Ragouso's Christmas party back in '55?
The one where you kissed Carmine.
What?
I never kissed Carmine.
You never even kissed Carmine.
I remember it like it was yesterday.
You wore a green satin dress and a fringed shawl which you did everything but sleep in.
You're crazy.
I lent my shawl to Maria Fenestru.
Who?
Maria, the one with the huge breasts.
There was no entertainment, so the men pitched pennies into her cleavage.
She walked off with $19 of my husband's hard-earned money.
She was wearing the fringed shawl.
Are you saying it was Maria who came on to Carmine?
Him and every other male there.
So why am I mad at you?
I'm mad at you.
You betrayed me.
I never betrayed anybody in my life.
Bull.
You told everybody Salvadore de Milo tried to kiss me.
- I never told a soul.
- Nobody else knew but you.
We were alone when I spilled my guts out.
We weren't alone.
Vinny Jamala was drunk under the table.
What are you talking about?
I can't believe you don't remember.
He threw up on your shoe.
That was Vinny?
He must have overheard everything.
He blabbed your secret.
- Then you never betrayed me?
- Of course not.
- You're my sister.
- Angela.
Sophia.
I don't believe this.
- I think it's sweet.
- I think I'm going to cry.
I think they should both be committed.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Somebody get that.
I'll just be a minute.
- I'm not dressed yet.
Rose?
- I can't.
Sophia, would you?
Sure, why not?
I'm over 80.
I've had plenty of chances to rest in my lifetime.
Today alone, I probably sat down three, four times.
I'll answer the door and then I'll hot-tar the roof.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Tell me, how many of me do you see?
- We're twins.
- We're here to see Blanche.
So she's taking vitamins again.
- Good evening, Rob.
- Hello, Blanche.
Rob, you didn't tell me your brother Bob was a twin.
You didn't tell me your roommate was Grandma Moses.
I could fix your face so you don't look like twins.
Sophia.
This is Dorothy's mother.
Dorothy's the roommate who'll be joining us tonight.
Hello, everybody.
I'm sorry I kept you waiting.
This is Rob and his brother, Bob.
I swear I have seen you somewhere before.
There you are.
That's a joke.
Blanche didn't mention that you were twins.
I never met Bob until tonight.
Blanche, I told you we were exactly alike.
Dorothy, you'll be thanking me for years to come.
At least we won't argue over who has the cuter date.
- Stanley.
- Dorothy, I need to talk.
Stan is her ex-husband.
Biggest loser you'll see.
Good evening.
Always good to see you, doll-face.
I'm going out.
We'll talk some other time.
And in future, I would appreciate some notice before you drop by.
Let's say one, two, six months.
I have a stack of papers we need to go over before the surgery.
Surgery?
Finally going ahead with that hair transplant?
Sophia, not everybody knows this isn't real.
Please.
Stevie Wonder could tell it's a rug.
Believe me, I wish it were only a hair transplant.
But look I won't ruin your evening.
I'll be here when you return.
God willing.
We're seeing Merv Griffin in The Crucible.
I'll risk it.
Come on, let's go.
Look, Stan, I made these plans a week ago.
How can you expect me to disappoint Rob?
- Bob.
- Bob.
Stan Stan, are we talking life and death?
The doctors say I'm lucky to be talking at all.
Hi, everybody.
Rose, could you take my place with Rob?
- Bob.
- Bob.
I wish I could, but I'm driving the bookmobile for the Grief Centre.
Isn't that during the day?
Usually, but I got tied up at work and now I feel so guilty.
There are so many depressed people with nothing to read.
Of course, when I'm depressed, I can't read.
I knit.
Maybe I should drive a knitmobile.
Maybe she should drive a nitwitmobile.
I think you should call a friend.
Boys, would you wait in the car?
I wanna talk to Dorothy.
- Sure.
Come on, Rob.
- Bob.
Bob.
Blanche, I'm sorry, but I have to stay and talk to Stan.
You'll get somebody.
I have mixed feelings about calling anybody.
There's something strangely provocative about this evening.
I would never have a relationship with both twins at the same time.
That would be obscene.
Unless, of course, it was tastefully done.
What was it you wanted to talk about?
Not now, Dorothy.
Finish your thought, Blanche.
Into the kitchen, Stanley.
I'll send one of them home.
Only, which one?
You know, Sophia, I used to have this recurring dream about twins.
They always killed each other over me.
Maybe I'll drive.
I have a recurring dream.
John Cameron Swayze straps a Timex to my chin and tosses me across an icy pond.
I checked a book of symbols.
Nothing there.
That's it.
I'm done.
What?
You want me to bring down a curtain?
Bypass surgery.
You mean heart bypass?
Yeah, the doctor says the problem's been brewing for years.
I don't understand it.
I always exercise, eat healthy.
Please.
Your idea of healthy eating is taking the skin off a knockwurst.
Whatever.
He says I don't have a choice anymore.
Dorothy.
Come on, you have to pull yourself together.
Babe, don't worry.
I'm a survivor.
Everything's cool.
The cat who's gonna cut me is primo.
I said pull yourself together, not talk like Sammy Davis Jr. I only meant that the operation is a very common procedure.
Everything's gonna turn out just fine.
On the other hand, they are going to crack open my chest and slice my heart like the lox platter at Wolfie's.
Good, someone's going for lox.
Get bagels, an assortment.
Ma, Stanley's having bypass surgery on Friday.
So?
He can take the car.
And, Stan, no poppy seeds.
They get caught under my dentures.
Sophia, at least you could pretend to be concerned.
Really, I'm worried sick.
Also, a half a dozen sour pickles and two prune Danish.
I want the lox to visit, not set up shop there.
Ma, this is serious surgery.
Surgery is easy.
The tough part is after.
- Who'll take care of you?
- I haven't thought about that.
Think about it.
You live alone, no one likes you.
- Be nice, Ma.
- Come here to recover.
- Not that nice, Ma.
- Dorothy, he's still family.
It's your fault he's family, but let's not dwell on that.
The yutz could die.
Sophia's got a point.
What am I gonna do?
Stan, Ma's right.
Come here to recover.
Have my room.
I'll move in with Ma.
Sophia, Dorothy, you're the greatest.
I don't know what to say.
Is it just your heart that's clogged or your ears too?
Half a pound of lox, a dozen bagels, assorted, two prune Danish, six sour pickles and a container of cream cheese.
Come in.
Tomorrow's the big day.
Are you excited?
Rose He's having a bypass, not going off to college.
You're gonna be fine.
I've brought you some clean towels.
Babe, you are a remarkable woman.
I said towels, Stanley, not a kidney.
- She is trying to be brave.
- She's very convincing.
Have a wonderful night.
We're wishing you luck in case we don't see you again.
Before you leave, for the hospital, not another world.
Let's not bother him anymore.
Let Stan rest in peace.
Sorry.
I've gotta pack your bag.
We have to leave at 7:30 to be admitted by 8:00.
- Dorothy.
- Yeah?
I really appreciate everything you're doing.
- I know that.
- I've never been this scared.
Come on.
You said yourself, it's a very common operation.
Still, something could go wrong.
There's always a chance.
When there's a chance, with me, it usually does.
The way I figure it, I'm gonna die, Dorothy.
Stanley, you're not going to die.
Yes, I am.
I'm gonna die.
That's why there are some things I must say to you.
I love you, Dorothy.
That sounds crazy because I walked out on you, but it's true.
I've already forgiven you for that.
Besides, in the grand scheme of things, it's not bad to wait 38 years to make your first big mistake.
- It wasn't my first mistake.
- What?
The Chain-Linked Fence Retailers' Convention in Atlantic City in 1957?
My God.
You had an affair at the convention.
There was no convention.
I just had an affair.
- Stanley.
- She didn't mean a thing to me.
She was a waitress in a little Greek diner.
She'd put some rolls on the table and say, "Can I butter your buns"?
One morning she said it and there were no rolls on the table.
Next thing I knew, we were in Atlantic City.
Dorothy, I swear to you, it was just that one time.
Forgive me.
Forgive you?
I'm sitting at home with two screaming kids praying you'll sell enough to put food on the table, and you're off planting your flag on Mount Olympus.
Dorothy, you make it sound so cheap.
Say you understand.
I need to know you forgive me before they cut me open.
They may have to stand in line.
Dorothy, please.
Alright, alright.
You're off the hook, Stanley.
Go to the hospital with a clean conscience.
I forgive you.
Dorothy, you've got the compassion of a priest, you do.
But you'd have to be the Vatican softball team to forgive me for the other time.
The other time?
I didn't mean it to happen.
I was in the bar next to that diner.
A woman sat next to me.
We talked, we drank, we broke a few dishes.
The next thing I knew, I came to in a motel, my toupee in my mouth.
I cannot believe this.
I cannot believe that I am hearing this.
I always assumed something like this could happen, but that it would be your secretary who couldn't type or take shorthand.
You're wrong on two counts, Dorothy.
She could take shorthand and I did have an affair with her.
I am shocked.
That airhead could take shorthand?
Dorothy, I am going into hospital and may not come out.
If so, I want you to know that, despite everything, I have never loved anyone as much as you.
- I know that, Stan.
- Then you forgive me?
- I forgive you.
- I feel so much better.
And that makes me feel so much better.
Ma, where were you?
We've been worried.
You know who's in this hospital?
Rochelle Devito.
She slipped in the shower, broke her hip, fell through the shower doors, hit her head against the sink got a concussion and swallowed her dentures.
To hear her complaining, you'd think no one else had problems.
I took some of her cookies.
Hungry?
- I'm too upset to eat.
- They're doing all they can.
I know, I know.
I'm sorry.
I'm just scared.
- It's understandable.
- No, it's surprising.
You know, when I was married to Stan, there were moments when I'd think, "My God, what if I lost him"?
I guess you can't turn your back on 38 years of living because part of me feels that way.
I didn't expect it.
I thought the next time I'd visit would be for Ma.
As I'm here, I'll break my hip so you won't have to come back.
You know, it's strange.
If anything happened to Stan, I would feel like his widow.
I know I'm not, but we've been through so much together that that's how I'd feel.
I remember the first time anybody called me a widow.
I was terribly Ionely and depressed, just missing George something awful.
Finally, my best friend persuaded me to join her for a night out.
We no sooner stepped through the door into the Boots And Saddle Grill than these two big truckers offered us a drink.
That is, till one of them noticed my wedding band.
I was so stunned I couldn't speak.
But Becky-Sue said, "That's alright, she's a widow".
- Blanche, you poor baby.
- I know.
Next time I decided to party when George was out of town, I left that ring at home.
Blanche, you were unfaithful to George?
No, I was only flirting.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Keeps you healthy, keeps you in shape.
Keeps your buttocks firm.
And I wasted all that time on jazzercise.
I have to confess, I hate being called a widow.
It sounds so permanent and final.
I don't believe for one minute that it is.
Someday Charlie and I will be together again.
Probably not in the old house.
We don't need that much room.
The kids are grown and we'll be dead.
- Excuse me, Mrs Zbornak.
- Yes.
I'm Dr Deutsch.
I wanted to let you know Mr Zbornak's out of surgery and doing fine.
- Thank God.
- He's in recovery.
He'll be out of intensive care within 48 hours.
Ma.
I understand he'll be spending his recovery period with you.
- That's right.
- It's a critical time for him.
But with proper care, he'll be good as new within three months.
Did you say three months?
Ma, he said three months.
You call that wrestling, you pansy?
If you can't take a crotch slam, get out of the business.
This is great, just great.
You and me watching television together.
There's a great basketball game on Seven.
I said come out of your room, not talk to me.
I'm kind of an expert in basketball.
That's what's interesting about me.
You've lived here for two months, there's nothing interesting about you.
No.
I mean it.
Ask me anything.
When the hell are you moving out?
- You kill me.
- I'd love to.
- Hello there, Stanley.
- Hi, guys.
Wait right here, honey.
You'll never guess what this wonderful fool just did.
He bought a fire-engine red convertible.
Put it on his credit card.
- I have to get a wrap.
- Dude, so you won out.
I figured you would.
I overheard Blanche telling the girls last night that you got all the brains, charm and sex appeal, while your brother Rob the slob batted a big fat zero.
OK, Rob, I'm ready.
Let's go.
You're Rob?
- Bye, Blanche.
- Why?
What's wrong?
Ask him.
- Stan?
- I thought Rob was Bob and I said something I shouldn't have.
Stan, I'm gonna kill you.
I'm gonna kill you.
Do you know what this is?
A plate I dropped.
I was gonna pick it up.
This is not just a plate, mister.
This is a family heirloom.
It's Great-Great-Grandma Nylund's ceremonial wedding plate.
- Wedding plate?
- Yes.
The bride's family fills the plate with fruit and the guests eat from it.
When the last piece is gone, the bride and groom leave to start their wedding night in a tent or a Best Western.
A Best Western?
The Vikings have always been a very progressive people.
Anyway, that's when it's time for the husband to symbolically offer himself to his new bride.
On the plate.
I ate a tuna sandwich on that plate this afternoon.
Stan, I'm never going to forgive you for this.
My niece is getting married.
What will her husband do?
I bet a gravy boat would work, at a pinch.
Stan, I went to three stores, but I finally found the stuff to make you sleep.
Strawberry Quik.
You are the best, babe.
I'm gonna take a shower.
If you could bring me a mug in ten minutes, that'd be perfect.
- That man is driving me crazy.
- Me too.
We have to get him out of here.
I know it's difficult living with Stanley.
I did it for 38 years.
But the man is recovering from major surgery.
He needs us.
- He is taking advantage of you.
- He is sick.
He's the only one who knows when he's ready to leave.
It's his decision.
Sometimes people need help making decisions.
That's the way it was with Thor.
Our pet lamb.
From the time he was first separated from his mother, he wouldn't eat, he wouldn't sleep, he wouldn't frolic with the other sheep.
You're slipping into verse, Rose.
Keep it simple.
Daddy got the idea of taking this old inner tube, wrapping it in wool and putting it next to Thor's bed at night.
We named it Brun Hilda.
It did the trick.
Thor felt like he was back with his mother and he began eating and sleeping - And frolicking.
- Yes.
But then one day, Thor got playful and accidentally bit Brun Hilda.
The poor little guy just stood there, watching his mother deflate before his very eyes.
He was never the same after that.
Sure, once in a while he'd "baa" at the back tires of a car.
But for the most part, he just kept to himself.
- I see your point.
- You do?
Who cares?
You wanna hear the sequel?
The point is Stan is getting too comfortable.
He may never wanna leave.
- She is right, Dorothy.
- She is not.
He is recuperating.
He is not getting comfortable.
He doesn't wanna stay any longer than necessary.
- Stan, you're wearing my robe.
- Tell me about it.
Which one of Stan's angels forgot to pick up my dry-cleaning?
Cheesecake.
I just love it when we all get together like this.
Stanley, don't you think it's a coincidence you get a relapse on the day the doctor says you can move back home?
The heart's a funny organ.
I bet most of your organs get a laugh.
- Blanche, I sense hostility.
- Good, because I hate you.
She's edgy because we've been taking care of you for two months, you've been eating all our food and making life unbearable.
That's not a very charitable view.
What are you making for lunch?
Listen, we've been more than charitable.
In the village my ancestors came from, if a man was bad company, unable to provide for his family and no fun under the yak skin, the women would leave him to die.
Tough village.
I spoke to Dr Deutsch.
He says there's nothing to worry about.
Some patients do experience a sudden setback like this, just when their recovery seems to be complete.
Boy, what rotten luck.
I guess I was pushing myself too hard, trying to do too many things.
Could you hand me the remote control from the top of the television?
I think you should get some sleep.
Maybe you're right.
Wake me for lunch, OK?
Davis is bringing the ball up.
He's taking it slow to mid-court.
He's making a move.
He's driving the lane.
It's up.
It's good.
You feeling better, Magic?
Dorothy, Dorothy, I I know this sounds insane.
But I thought that physical activity would help me snap this setback.
I was wrong, you were right.
I should rest.
Could you help me get back into bed?
Stanley, how could you fake a relapse?
Do I deserve this?
I took care of you because I thought you needed me.
I defended you to my friends.
I mean, why did you do this?
I'm scared, Dorothy.
I'm scared of being alone.
This whole experience has made me feel so vulnerable.
So mortal.
Being here with you makes me feel secure.
Sure, it's great having somebody cook your meals, clean your room, do your laundry, entertain you.
It's terrific.
But that's not why I wanted to stay.
It's just a bonus.
I wanted to stay because I'm happiest with the people I love.
Stanley Stanley, you know, in all the years we've been together I don't think you've ever opened up to me this way and poured out such crap.
Didn't buy any of it?
Not true.
I believe you're scared.
You've just discovered something most of us have known for years: Life doesn't always turn out exactly the way you like it.
I found that out when you divorced me.
I was scared and alone.
But I survived.
And now you will too.
Because you have to.
Does this mean you're throwing me out?
I'm not throwing you out, I'm pushing you out of the nest.
You can't come here with every problem.
I'm not your mother.
I'm not even your wife anymore.
Now, Stanley, it's time that you grew up.
Happy birthday, Peter Pan.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
- Hi, Dorothy.
- Hi, Ma.
Why are you wearing a raincoat?
It's 80 degrees outside.
I had a chill.
I have another question.
Is that a sabre under your coat?
Yeah, I think it is.
See you later.
Ma, take off the coat.
Ma, did you forget to take your blood pressure medicine again?
I've got a job at Captain Jack's Seafood Shanty.
- Why?
- I need money.
- I give you money.
- An allowance.
Who am I, Dennis the Menace?
Look, Ma, you're 81.
Working all day is too much for you.
- I absolutely forbid it.
- Really, warden?
Are you sending me back to that home?
Ma, Shady Pines happens to be a beautiful retirement village.
Right.
And Morley Safer just wandered in there by mistake.
Dorothy, we have great news.
Guess who's starring in our production at the Community Theatre.
Blanche, please.
You say that every year.
And every year, we end up with Miami's answer to Meryl Streep.
Phyllis Hammerow.
She stinks.
I thought she was terrific in The Diary Of Anne Frank.
Please.
During the entire second act, the audience kept yelling, "She's in the attic.
She's in the attic".
This year, we just happen to have gotten a real actor.
A star of incredible magnitude.
Dorothy.
The Miami Community Players are gonna have the extraordinary experience of working with none other than the incandescent Mr Patrick Vaughn.
Patrick Vaughn?
Oh, my God.
He is my all-time favourite TV actor.
I cannot believe I am actually going to meet Patrick Vaughn.
I've had a crush on him for years.
He is the sexiest actor on TV.
I hate to admit it, but he melts my Haagen-Dazs.
Rose, you tramp.
I'll see you later, I'm going to work.
Ma, I absolutely forbid you to leave this house.
- I'm going to work.
- Over my dead body.
Fine, have it your way.
Go.
I'm tired of arguing with you.
Sophia.
Is that a Captain Jack's Seafood Shanty uniform you're wearing?
No, Rose.
I'm off to discover the Strait of Magellan.
Dorothy, is this a good champagne?
It's hard to tell.
The "two for $ 7" sticker is covering the year of vintage.
I'm sorry, Dorothy, but the welcoming committee is on a budget.
Hurry up arranging those flowers.
Mr Vaughn's arriving from the airport any minute.
My God, that's him.
- How does the room look?
- Who cares?
How do I look?
Welcome, Mr Ma.
- Thanks, Dorothy.
- Give me those.
- What are you doing here?
- I had an hour to kill.
I'm here to meet Mr Hollywood.
- You can't stay.
- Are you embarrassed by me?
Dressed like Vasco da Gama, yes.
Am I in the right place?
Are you ever.
Allow me to introduce myself.
I'm Patrick Vaughn.
Rose.
Look, Rose, it's It's He's I'm We This is my daughter Dorothy.
She's an English teacher.
- And you are?
- Linda Ronstadt.
I'm doing The Pirates Of Penzance across town.
This is my mother, Sophia Petrillo.
Who has to be going.
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.
Mr Vaughn, my name is Blanche Devereaux.
- Blanche.
- And this is Rose Nylund.
Rose.
And this over here is Dorothy Zbornak.
We just want you to know how excited we are that an artist of your stature is performing in our little theatre.
Ladies, there are no small theatres, no small parts, - only small actors.
- Like Herve Villechaize.
I was speaking metaphorically.
Please go on.
That's such a beautiful language.
Rose, why don't we just show Mr Vaughn around the theatre?
Why don't I do that myself?
I've had the most experience performing here.
Blanche, the parking lot doesn't count.
I'll do it.
I want to do it.
I don't have the time now.
I'm doing another project in town.
I have to meet the director to discuss the nuances of my character.
I read about that.
Aren't you playing a tangerine in a commercial?
Yes.
How exciting.
Have you ever been a fruit before?
No, but having been in musical theatre for 30 years, I've had my share of offers.
It was a delight meeting you.
Mr Vaughn, remember, casting is tomorrow at two.
I'm looking forward to it.
I trust all of you will read for the part of my leading lady.
To hell with this town.
Come away with me.
But Biff, you are a drifter.
How can I just pull up stakes and run off with you?
Please reconsider, Josie.
You're the prettiest girl in the county.
Shut up.
Go on, Biff.
I need your answer now, Josie.
What's it gonna be?
I want you to take me, Biff.
Right here on the stage.
Pardon me?
I'm sorry.
That was just an ad-lib.
Blanche Devereaux?
Just a moment.
My God.
My rear tires have less pressure in them.
I'm ready.
The moon is hanging awful low in the sky tonight, isn't it, Busty?
Josie.
It sure is, Biff.
- It makes me want to kiss you.
- Mind your manners, Biff.
We're at the 4th of July picnic.
The whole town is here.
- Come away with me.
- But you're a drifter, Biff.
I can't just run off with you.
Please reconsider.
You're the prettiest girl in the county.
I need to have your answer now.
What's it gonna be?
I want you to take me, Biff.
Blanche, I am sorry.
I'm afraid I popped your bosom.
Don't you worry about a thing, Patrick.
My backup pair can take a lot more punishment.
You've made a complete fool of yourself.
Yeah?
Wait and see who gets the part.
Could I have everyone's attention, please?
We had to make a few very difficult choices, but remember, and I mean this, everyone here is a star.
Now, playing the part of Josie will be Phyllis Hammerow.
The sheriff will be played by Ronald Bromberg.
The rest of you will be non-speaking townspeople.
Thank you very much.
I don't believe it.
- Phyllis Hammerow.
- I am stunned.
- He didn't like any one of us.
- Let's get out of here.
I'll meet you at the car.
I forgot my purse.
Blanche.
Yes, Judas?
You're mad because you didn't get the part.
Darned right.
Was Phyllis better than me?
Much better.
But you are far more attractive.
- I know.
What's your point?
- I've never done this before.
I hardly know you.
But would you consider having dinner with me?
Why, yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Wait till my friends hear about this.
This must be our little secret.
I'm in the middle of a rather messy divorce, - and if reporters - Say no more.
I'm not naive about these things.
I have a subscription to People magazine.
Then, until tonight at eight o'clock.
See you later, Boff.
Biff.
Patrick.
Blanche, come on.
- Hi, Mr Vaughn.
- Please, call me Patrick.
Rose, there's been something I've wanted to ask you all day.
Mine are real.
That's not what I wanted to ask, but that is good to know.
Rose, ever since we met, I felt there was something between us.
Would you have dinner with me?
Jeepers.
Yes.
Wait till Blanche and Dorothy hear It'll have to be our secret.
I'm in the middle of a messy divorce.
I understand.
I read People magazine.
Then, until tonight, at ten o'clock.
I don't know what you just did, but you'd make one hell of a yodeller.
Blanche?
Rose?
Hello.
I'm glad you're here.
There's something I want to ask you.
One, do you read People magazine?
And two, are you doing anything tonight around midnight?
It's been a wonderful afternoon.
It's been a wonderful week, Blanche.
Our relationship's so special, I can't keep it a secret any longer.
It's hard on me too, Blanche.
But one day, I'll rent a plane and write it in the sky.
Patrick, sit down.
I want to make a confession.
I've never told this to another living soul, but I'm not perfect.
- Blanche.
- No, I mean it.
Look in my left eye.
What do you see?
There's a little sleep crust in the corner.
No, I mean in the centre.
See, there's just a slight flaw in my iris.
Yes.
- Blanche.
Patrick.
- What are you doing here?
- I live here.
- You are roommates?
That's right.
Now what is going on?
Patrick was helping me rehearse my part in the play.
Rehearse what?
You're a non-speaking townsperson.
We added a stunt, where Blanche gets tossed to the floor.
Watch.
I'm getting the hang of that.
I think I'll just go and practice it on the lawn.
Patrick, what is really going on?
I made up that flimsy excuse hoping to run into you.
- I've really missed you.
- Wait a minute.
Do you think I'm an idiot?
You said you didn't know Blanche and I were roommates.
- And she believed it.
- God, you're a wonderful actor.
There's no acting involved when I'm around you, Dorothy.
- This week has been incredible.
- Let's tell everyone how we feel about each other.
Patrick.
What are you doing here?
Why are you on the floor?
I dropped a contact.
You expect me to believe that?
You don't wear contacts.
She dropped my contact.
You see, I ran into Dorothy downtown and mentioned that I'd run out of contact solution.
She said she had plenty here, because she doesn't wear them.
So, here we are.
OK.
Here it is.
I found it.
- You found what?
- The lens.
Which I'll now rinse out in the solution we have too much of.
Thank goodness you're here.
I made up that ridiculous explanation hoping I'd run into you.
- So, you live here too?
- Yes.
- Why ask if I live here if?
- Kiss me, Rose.
Go easy, Patrick.
It's not a toy.
I have to go.
- We're still on for tonight?
- You betcha.
- Same rendezvous as last night.
- 10:45, you'll pull up behind the theatre and leave the trunk open.
Yes.
Goodbye.
- You're leaving so soon?
- I'm afraid so.
I'll see you tonight.
At the theatre.
Yes.
Just at the theatre.
- I must take my leave.
- Don't leave your lens.
My lens.
I think maybe I'd better put it in now.
There, that's better.
Farewell.
God, he's good.
Excuse me.
Have you seen Patrick?
- Have you seen Patrick?
- No.
- Who's the flower for?
- It's for Patrick.
It's a rose for good luck on opening night.
- I'll give it to him.
- Why?
Have you heard that old theatrical saying?
- No.
- Never accept a rose from somebody named Rose on opening night.
- Good evening, ladies.
- Hello, Patrick.
I got you something in honour of opening night.
Thank you, Blanche.
That's very thoughtful.
I'd have gotten you a rose too, if I was named Violet.
Mr Vaughn.
Mr Vaughn.
Did you hear about the cast change?
Ronald Bromberg has the flu.
- He can't play the sheriff.
- Who can take over the part?
Hello.
She's the only one who fits into the costume.
Dorothy, maybe we'd better run the lines.
Isn't he the greatest?
Yeah, the great ones always throw in a back rub.
What?
- Have you seen Patrick?
- Yes, he's rehearsing lines.
What do you want him for?
- I want to give him this.
- I'll give it to him.
Believe me, he'd rather get it from me.
He has been all week.
What?
He swore me to secrecy, but I have to tell someone.
We're in love.
We've been together since he got into town.
Have a good show.
Phyllis is such a liar.
She sure is.
Since Patrick got into town, he's been seeing me.
Places, everyone.
My name's Biff.
I'm a drifter.
My story isn't a pretty one, but it needs to be told.
It was 1952.
Wykahatchie, Mississippi.
The town 4th of July picnic.
Evenin', Sheriff.
Evening, fellow Wykahatchiite.
- Evening, Sheriff.
- Evening, Biff.
What you doing here?
The usual.
Just drifting.
You stabbed me in the back.
Me?
You're the backstabber.
Excuse us.
How much longer you planning on staying in town, Biff?
Hard to tell.
I'm gonna keep my eye on you.
The sun was mighty hot today, wasn't it, Josie?
It sure was, Biff.
Patrick swore that I was the only woman in his life.
- He told me the same thing.
- You liar.
He said he was gonna tell everybody about us.
When the time was right, he was gonna rent a plane and write it in the sky?
Yes.
You, sir, are a dirt bag.
I'm sorry.
It must be the heat.
What are you two doing?
Patrick is in the middle of an exquisite performance.
You have no idea how many performances he has been giving.
- What?
- He's been seeing me and Blanche and Phyllis behind our backs.
You're a dirt bag.
- He's been seeing me, too.
- What?
- Yes.
- That man is slime.
- Pond scum.
- Flugenachen.
What?
Flugenachen.
It's Scandinavian for someone who docks his boat in a handicapped slip.
It's time that man was exposed for what he really is.
- I'm gonna tell him right now.
- Blanche.
I love you, Josie.
You're the only woman in my life.
That's a sack of cold chestnuts, mister.
- Blanche.
- Don't Blanche me, lowlife.
You think you can just have your way with any woman?
- There was someone else?
- Yes.
There was me, Rose - And me.
- You slept with the sheriff?
Lord knows how many others he took advantage of.
Ladies, I can explain.
But now is not the time.
I'll tell you what time it is.
Time for a hanging.
Get me a rope.
And a tree from props.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Let me speak.
All right.
I admit, I'm guilty.
But what's the big deal?
We all had a good time.
All of you who had a good time, put your hands back up.
You liar.
Put your hand down.
So what harm did I do?
What harm did you do?
You lied to everybody.
You, sir, are nothing but a low-down, carpetbagging scallywag.
And as God is my witness, I will never shampoo your hair again.
And another thing You'll never what?
- Don't ask.
- You know how we all feel.
So why don't you get out of our sight, our lives and our town right now?
- I feel like such a fool.
- Me too.
Don't worry, girls.
The audience had a good time.
And they got their money back.
That's not what we're talking about, you titmouse.
We were talking about how humiliated we all were by Patrick.
You're right.
I feel so common, so cheap.
So used.
How do you usually deal with that, Blanche?
Just for that, I'm gonna flush the toilet while you're taking a shower.
It's all our own fault.
We behaved like a bunch of teenage groupies.
The first good-Iooking, sexy, debonair, charming man that rolls into town, and we got on him quicker than mustard on a tie at a county fair.
It's hard to stay mad at the guy.
I don't know.
There was something special about him.
He made me feel beautiful.
He made me feel young.
He made me feel smart.
God, what an actor.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
- What the hell is that?
- A wedding cake for Joanie Winston up the street.
Sam and Edna's daughter.
That's a girl?
- Dorothy, why are you up?
- Her banging woke me.
- What do you mean?
- The toilet seat.
Four women live in this house.
The toilet seat never has to move.
You always make it bang.
Forgive me, sweetheart.
Just get me a litter box to keep next to my night stand.
Rose, is that a wedding cake you're making?
It's my wedding present to Joanie Winston.
Joanie Winston's getting married?
How lovely.
I wonder how she'll fix the hair on her ears.
The wildest part of the evening was when the busboy dropped his brush in my lap.
- Not the man of your dreams?
- He's a seven.
- That's not bad.
- He was more like a five, but he looked so good with me on his arm, I added two points.
That cake looks delicious.
Let's cut her up.
I was gonna give it to Joanie Winston.
But if you're hungry, I'd still have time to make another one.
Course I have to address those 3,000 envelopes.
After I pick up the decorations for the hootenanny.
But I'll still have time to wash cars in the afternoon.
And give blood before seven.
Rose, this is insane.
You have to learn how to say no.
Why don't you sit down and relax a while?
- Shall we have our usual?
- Great idea.
- I'll get bowls and spoons.
- I'll get the ice cream.
I'll get chocolate sauce and whipped cream.
Did anybody see a piece of paper with directions on it?
We've made sundaes hundreds of times.
We don't need directions.
I mean directions for the wedding.
They need the cake by eight.
Do you believe her?
She doesn't stop for a minute.
I understand the thinking behind it.
My granddaddy was the same way.
He said, "Idle hands are the devil's workshop".
Course he also said, "Sitting on cold concrete will cause haemorrhoids".
So we just learned when to ignore him.
- Oh, my God.
- Rose.
- What happened?
Honey.
- Call an ambulance.
- My goodness.
- Rose.
Take it easy.
Dorothy, I'm scared.
I've never seen Rose look so terrible.
- I know.
I'm worried, too.
- Knock it off.
There's nothing to worry about.
How do you know that?
At my age, you can spot the 12 warning signs of death.
- What are they?
- Number one, your children start visiting during the week.
Number two, your doctor won't let you postdate a cheque.
Number three, you can't eat Cream O' Wheat because it's too spicy.
Will you stop?
Will you stop?
- I mean, this could be serious.
- Of course it could.
So I'm trying not to think about it.
If anything happened to Rose, it would be like losing my own child.
I'm going to the cafeteria.
My canasta club gives the hospital jello three stars.
Excuse me, are you the ladies with Mrs Nylund?
Yes.
I'm Dr Wallerstein.
I've been treating her.
Dorothy, she's gonna be all right.
Her doctor's a Jew.
Blanche, please.
How is she, Dr Jew?
- Wallerstein.
- Come and see for yourselves.
Rose, honey.
How are you feeling?
You gave us quite a scare.
- Doctor, will she be all right?
- She'll be fine.
- It was an oesophageal spasm.
- A what?
A constriction of the food pipe.
It can be painful and frightening, but it's not serious.
- Thank God.
- She just needs to take it easy.
Rose, relax here for a few more minutes, then your friends can take you home.
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Yes, thank you.
Is he gone?
Yeah.
Is something wrong?
You want him back?
No, I have to tell you what happened.
I died.
I died and went to heaven.
Rose, honey, you didn't die.
You passed out.
Hallucinated.
Remember that New Year's Eve when you had the three margaritas?
You thought you were an animated broom in Fantasia?
Look, I know it sounds crazy.
That's why I wouldn't tell anybody but my closest friends.
But it's true.
It really is.
I died and went to heaven.
It wasn't actually heaven proper.
It was somewhere on the outskirts.
You died and went to a suburb of heaven?
No.
No, it was an enormous train station.
Like Grand Central, only cleaner.
And without Hare Krishnas asking for money.
There were people everywhere, rushing off to catch trains, sitting on benches, browsing in the souvenir shop.
- The souvenir shop?
- Of course, Blanche.
They were all buying T-shirts, saying, "Today is the first day of the end of your life".
And at the information desk was this huge train schedule.
And next to every departure, it said, "Destination Heaven".
My first thought was, "What a great title for a movie".
My second thought was, "Damn.
I'm dead".
I was so stunned, I started wandering aimlessly through this train station, when I heard a familiar voice calling, "Wose.
Wose.
Is that weally you"?
It was my Uncle Johannsen.
He died when I was nine years old.
A steam shovel hit him in the mouth.
I was so happy to see a familiar face.
At least from the nose up.
Right.
Anyway, Uncle Johannsen asked to see my ticket.
And he said, "Whoa.
Wose, this is a wound-twip ticket".
"You can go back and continue to live your life".
"But before you go, I have two pieces of advice".
"Don't get hit in the mouth with a steam shovel, that can kill you".
"And make the most of the time you're given".
"You'd be surpwised how quickly it goes".
Rose, it's been a tough night, so why don't we go home, west, and talk about your twip in the morning.
Dorothy, don't you realise what happened?
I died and came back.
I was given a second chance.
A chance to do all the things I've never done, live my life for myself for a change.
You're looking at a new Rose Nylund.
The girl who's gonna eat life.
Hi, cookie.
How are you feeling?
Fine, Sophia.
But I did die.
I died and went to heaven.
That's nice.
Find out what pills they gave her and ask for a doggie bag.
I'm coming.
Hello?
No, Rose is not here.
Do you know what time it is?
It is not party time, it is sleepy time.
No, that is not an invitation.
Sir, you cannot die from that.
No, it's just uncomfortable.
Take a cold shower and the normal colour will return.
Bye-bye.
Now, who in hell was that?
- Another one of Rose's new friends.
- Friends?
They're more like animals.
All they do is party all hours of the night.
I am abhorred.
We know what you are.
Glad to hear you admit it.
Sophia, I said abhorred.
A whore, a slut, a tramp, it's all the same.
Ma, we're talking about Rose.
Yeah, lately she's been a whore, too.
Frankly, I am worried about her.
This new lifestyle is probably harder on her than on us.
What do you mean harder on her?
We have to carry the responsibility around here while she's out there "eating life".
I ate Life once.
Not a bad cereal.
When we run out of Shredded Wheat, let's try it.
- Ma, go to bed.
- I'll have Shredded Wheat now.
That way, we'll get to the Life sooner.
I'm really worried about her.
Sophia's always like that in the middle of the night.
Not Ma.
Rose.
Ever since she took that death trip, she's changed.
That's no excuse.
Shirley MacLaine died six times, and she's sweet as pie.
Hi, girls.
I'm glad you're up.
We're going to the beach for a sunrise breakfast.
- Why don't you join us?
- No, thank you, Rose.
Suit yourself.
I'll just grab a few blankets.
Rose, come on, sit down.
We have to talk.
I can't.
I've got people waiting and they're a rowdy bunch.
- Aren't you overdoing this?
- Overdoing what?
Come on, Rose.
It's OK to want more out of life, but you're pushing yourself too hard.
- I can handle it.
- You can't.
And you're driving us crazy.
- I'm just living my life.
- Yes, but you're ruining ours.
You get calls at all hours.
You have people running around this house.
And you don't help around here anymore.
So that's what this is about.
You're upset because I'm not doing things for everybody else.
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.
Rose, honey, we're only thinking of you.
I'm only thinking of me, too.
If you can't adjust to my new lifestyle, maybe we have a problem here.
No, Rose.
You're the one who has a problem.
I can't live my life the way I want?
Not if it disrupts everybody else's life.
You're impossible to live with.
Is that so?
Then there's just one thing to do.
I'll just have to move out.
I got a letter from Gina Marie Donatelli.
Her cousin Joe is hanging wallpaper in Tony Bennett's guest bathroom.
That's nice.
Celebrities stop by all the time.
In one day, he saw Dean Martin, Liberace, Don Rickles and Mitzi Gaynor.
All these people used the bathroom in the same day?
What am I, urologist to the stars?
I'm just telling you what she told me.
Sorry, Ma, I wasn't paying attention.
- I keep thinking about Rose.
- Forget about her.
If she doesn't want to be our roommate, fine.
I'm happy she's leaving.
You see how happy I am?
You try.
If you don't mind, Blanche, I'll laugh on the inside.
I'm ready to go.
Rose, before you go, I just want to give you a little advice.
Sometimes in life, you start out down one path.
Suddenly, the wind changes direction, and you find yourself swimming upstream, looking for new horizons.
What the hell does that mean?
Don't get smart with me.
If I was a short, bald guy in a diaper spouting this gibberish, I'd be running India.
- I guess this is it.
- Yep, guess so.
Isn't it funny how things turn out?
Being dead really changed my life.
It does that for a lot of people.
I know you don't understand or approve, but I'm doing what I have to and I feel good about it.
Thanks for everything.
It's been great.
Rose.
I'll see that all your mail is forwarded.
Thanks, I'd appreciate that.
Rose.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- Hi, Stephanie.
- Hi, Rhonda.
- It's Rose.
- Sorry.
That's quite all right.
There's a little poem that might help you remember.
Your name is Rose.
I think I can handle that.
Okey-dokey.
Why don't we take a nice walk on the beach?
- I hate the beach.
- Then why live here?
It's near work.
- Do you have a Valium?
- No.
But I do have a tangerine Lifesaver.
That helps chase the blues away.
No, thanks.
I don't like the hard stuff.
- Hi, Steph.
- Stephanie.
God, am I beat.
That London trip is a killer.
I've got to be in Paris in 12 hours.
Hi, Liz.
We haven't met.
Stephanie's mother.
I'd recognize you anywhere.
No.
No, I'm Rose, your new roommate.
Great.
Welcome aboard.
She seems like a nice person.
- Where is she from?
- I don't know.
- Is she a beach person?
- I don't know.
How long have you lived together?
- About a year.
- Really?
Look, Rose, we all go our separate ways around here.
Besides, you have your own friends, don't you?
I've sort of lost touch with my new beach friends.
But that's OK.
I'm a Ioner.
A rebel.
I can't believe I'm living right on the beach.
I remember the first time I ever saw the ocean.
On my honeymoon.
My husband and I drove from Minnesota to New York.
Actually, we were driving to California.
We were young and in love, and I was blowing in Charlie's ear.
He lost his sense of direction on the turnpike.
We didn't care.
We were just so so crazy about each other that - Hi, Dorothy.
- What's all that stuff?
We've been so down since Rose moved out, so I bought us something.
- How sweet of you.
- I know.
This is for me.
This is for me.
This is for me.
This was for you, but it's so cute, now it's for me.
This is for you.
Edible panties.
What a lovely sentiment.
Thank you.
- You really like them?
- Like 'em?
I love 'em.
In fact, I may have the waistband with some milk before I go to bed tonight.
What's going on here?
I went shopping to cheer us up, but it didn't work.
- Let me tell you two a story.
- No.
- A short story.
- No.
An anecdote.
I won't take no for an answer.
Picture this.
sitting on a park bench.
Ralph says to Nunzio, "Whatever happened to that streaking craze"?
Nunzio says, "What streaking craze"?
Ralph says, "When everybody took off their clothes and ran down the street".
Nunzio says, "That sounds like fun.
I'll do it right now".
So, 90 years old, he gets naked and goes off down the street, right past these two old ladies, Carlotta and Maria.
Maria turns to Carlotta and says, "What the hell was that"?
And Carlotta says, "I don't know, but whatever it was, it sure needs ironing".
Ma, what's the point?
With a story, you get a point.
With an anecdote, pure entertainment.
We are upset about Rose.
We don't want to be entertained.
I'll give you a point without a story, just this once.
If you really miss her, go tell her.
Maybe she misses you too.
I don't know, Blanche.
What do you think?
- I really miss her.
- So do I. Let's go tell her.
Wait.
If she misses us, why hasn't she called?
Maybe she died, Blanche.
It happened before.
Maybe this time it took.
- Hello, Stephanie.
- Hi, Rose.
Liz, I didn't know you were home.
My flight got cancelled.
This is the first time we've been together in two weeks.
I have a great idea.
I'll whip us up a fancy dinner.
- Sorry, Rose, I have plans.
- So do I. See you later.
Look, Rose, you're a real sweet person, but I have to be honest.
We're all just roommates, not friends.
I hope that's OK.
That's fine.
Great.
Good.
Good night, Rose.
- Hello.
Is Rose Nylund?
- Dorothy.
Blanche.
Come on in.
Liz, Steph, these are my old roommates, - Dorothy and Blanche.
- Pleased to meet you.
- Have to run.
Sorry.
- Nice meeting you.
- I'll catch up with you later.
- What?
We have so many running jokes.
- What brings you two here?
- No, thanks.
We were in the neighbourhood and thought we'd just drop by.
It's lucky you caught me.
I'm usually out with Liz and Steph and the beach crowd.
- Then are things working out?
- I'll be honest.
- Yes?
- It is a dream come true.
Great.
Great.
That's just great.
Yup.
Rose, look.
We came here for a reason.
We wanted to tell you how happy we are that you're doing so well.
- I guess we should get going.
- You don't have to rush off.
I thought you were meeting your roommates.
Yeah, that's right.
We're just gonna be doing some beach stuff.
- You take care.
- You, too.
And you certainly do have a pretty place here.
Yeah.
Who wouldn't love it?
- Bye-bye, Rose.
- Bye.
- Hello?
- Front door.
Hello, front door.
Did two ladies just leave?
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you.
Hello, front door?
It's me again.
My name is Rose Nylund in 118.
I We haven't actually met, and I know this may sound a little bold, but I was wondering if Do you suppose you might like to go and have a cup of coffee?
I'd like to, but I'm pretty heavily involved with 122.
Sounds like a nice number.
Good night.
I cannot believe it is Saturday night, and I, Blanche Devereaux, the most witty, stunning, criminally sensuous woman to come out of the South since Miss Tallulah Bankhead, do not have a date.
- So?
I don't have one, either.
- What's your point?
So, what do you want to do tonight?
I guess we could clean our closets.
We could go to a movie.
We could do what we normally do.
Talk dirty and pig out.
I'll get the bowls and the spoons.
- I'll get the ice cream.
- I'll get the sauce and cream.
Anything interesting happen while I was gone?
- Does this mean you're back?
- If you'll have me.
Ma got a letter from Gina Marie Donatelli.
Her cousin Joe is hanging wallpaper in Tony Bennett's guest bathroom.
- I love Tony Bennett.
- So do I. He was always so sweet to me.
Blanche, you dated Tony Bennett?
I did more than date him.
He left his heart in San Francisco, but he left his shorts on my radiator.
- You're kidding.
- Hell, no.
Picture this
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Good morning, Ma.
What are you eating?
- Linguini with clam sauce.
- Who eats that for breakfast?
Mother Teresa.
It's a recipe from her new workout book.
Good morning, girls.
What are you eating, Sophia?
- Linguini with clam sauce.
- For breakfast?
Morning.
What are you eating, Sophia?
It's incredible.
on a peach, nobody would notice.
Ma, what's really going on?
You don't usually eat pasta for breakfast.
I'm carbohydrate loading.
I signed up for the charity walkathon.
Ma, are you nuts?
This is for people who walk a lot.
So what do I do, hover?
I've been walking since 1904.
They have a category for people over 80.
I think it's a terrific idea.
- Maybe we ought to join.
- We already did.
- What did you say?
- We already did.
I work all week.
I don't want to walk ten miles on a Saturday.
- We won't walk, we'll sit.
- Fine by me.
I like to sit.
We know.
It's your second-favourite position.
I don't mean sitting sitting, I mean baby-sitting.
Here, for the participants' children on race day.
Baby-sitting?
I don't like other people's children in my house.
Not even my own children.
- What else can we do?
- It'll be easy.
They're dropped off in the morning, picked up by four.
- Here's something.
How about sponging?
- What's that?
It says here, "Spongers help cool off the walkers by sponging and rubbing down their hot bodies as they pump their way through Miami".
It doesn't make much sense.
Get 'em all hot and then cool them down.
I swear, sometimes you can read my mind.
- Let's stick to baby-sitting.
- I agree.
All right.
Only for one day.
This is gonna be great.
I love charities.
In fact, I helped establish the Henry Fjord Foundation.
The Fjord Foundation?
Yes, Dorothy.
That's the man who built the Fjord Fjalcon.
Henry Fjord was a saint.
He dedicated his whole life to eliminating pond scum from Lake St Olaf.
His son, however, was a big disappointment.
Henry Fjord Junior.
He didn't want to follow in his father's footsteps.
He thought scum was beneath him.
I just realised the best reason of all - to join this walkathon.
- What's that, Ma?
I'd get away from this ditz for a whole day.
Hi, Rose.
What are you doing?
It's a variation on an old idea.
Home-made Mr Potato Heads.
You take a baked potato, give him two little raisin eyes, a carrot nose and a cucumber mouth.
Do you think we should give him some broccoli hair?
Why not add a gold chain?
We'll call it Sammy Potato Junior.
How did I let you talk me into this?
Those kids will break everything.
Blanche, you are overreacting.
For two days, you've taken everything we own and put it up on high shelves.
- I'm off.
Wish me luck.
- Good luck, Sophia.
Ma, are you sure about this?
I'm not even sure I have these pants on right.
I want you to go slow and pace yourself.
That's what I told your father.
All he did faster than eat was make love.
In both cases, before I was finished, he'd say, "I've had enough".
I wish you'd help me.
Those little monsters will be here any minute.
Hi.
I'm Bob Henderson.
This is my son Norman.
Hi, Norman.
My name is Rose.
You ready to have some fun?
Yes, ma'am.
Here's a list of Norman's likes and dislikes.
- These are only dislikes.
- Yeah, that's my Norman.
Fortunately, for today, he's your Norman.
Bye-bye.
Norman, I'd like you to meet my friends.
- This is Dorothy.
- Hello, Norman.
It's the bride of Frankenstein.
And I'm Blanche.
Can I interest you in arts and crafts?
- This really bites.
- What would you like to do?
I like army men.
There was a colonel here on Tuesday, but he went back to the base.
He means those little guys with the helmets.
I'm sorry, I only date officers.
Like to play with the potato head?
Sure.
What do you feel like doing?
That was fun.
You want to try it again?
- Are the babies asleep yet?
- They're pretending.
They're waiting to make fun of the way I change a diaper.
That's silly.
I bet they have only nice things to say about you.
Rose, I wasn't serious.
I know babies can't talk.
Yes, they can.
It's just that they're only understood by other babies.
And, of course, advanced civilizations far, far away.
Like where, Rose?
Vero Beach?
- Child, what are you doing?
- Nothing.
You're ripping pages from our book.
Somebody should take a hickory switch to your behind.
Calm down.
Calm down.
Let me show you how a professional teacher deals with this.
Norman, why are you ripping the pages out of that book?
Because my daddy's rich.
Do you know there are boys and girls less fortunate who have never even seen a book?
Everybody's got their sad stories.
He's all yours, Blanche.
How about a game of hide-and-seek?
- Sure.
- Yeah.
How about you, Norman?
Isn't that outfit a little young for you?
Come on, Norman, let's go.
- That boy hates me.
- No, he doesn't.
But he's right about the outfit.
Dorothy, you don't understand.
I've never felt comfortable around children.
And they can sense it.
I guess it's cos I was never really a child myself.
From the time I entered school, I behaved like a mature, young lady.
In fifth grade, my boyfriend had a fake ID.
I guess to relate to a child, it helps to have the mind of a child.
I'm the leader of the garbage man band Blanche, where would you get a crazy idea like that?
I'm the leader of the garbage man band Come on, honey.
There's no reason to cry.
Your mommy's gonna be here soon.
Still no answer at her parents' house.
They should have been here hours ago.
Call the walkathon people again.
Blanche, they said they'd call if they had any information about her parents.
Why does she keep crying like that?
She probably just misses her mother, and needs to hear a feminine voice.
And what was I doing?
My Ben Gazzara impersonation?
Let Blanche try.
We're not having any luck.
Me?
Heavens, no.
I don't know anything about that.
No.
I can't.
I don't Look at that.
She likes me.
Thank God.
Emily, pack up your diapers, you're going home.
Ma.
Why didn't you use your key?
I left it home.
It'd weigh me down.
Sophia.
How did you do?
- Great.
Easily a personal best.
- Tell us what happened.
It was electric.
The starter fired his pistol and I left half my competition in the dust.
You were that fast?
No, it was the over-80s.
Most of them dropped from fright.
You're kidding.
Please.
There's a natural build to these stories.
- Sorry.
- So, finally, the race was underway.
I start off slow.
I'm cagey, like a panther.
When the time is right, I pounce.
The crowd is on its feet.
"Sophia.
Sophia".
My heart is pounding in my ears.
Then again, it always pounds in my ears.
I could see the finish line.
It was only 200-300 yards away.
And then it happened.
What every runner dreads.
- I hit the wall.
- Ma, you ran out of steam.
No, I actually hit a wall.
They put up a new Wendy's on Collins Avenue.
From what they told me, I staggered over the finish line and collapsed.
People are talking national magazine covers.
- Why's that kid still here?
- Her parents haven't come yet.
Maybe they won't come back at all.
It happens.
Ma, don't be ridiculous.
You're just overly tired.
- Why don't you go to bed?
- Good idea.
If that's Sports Illustrated, tell them to call back tomorrow.
Hello?
Yes.
I see.
Yeah, I appreciate that.
Thank you.
- Emily's mom?
- The walkathon people.
Everybody's left the staging area, there's no sign of Emily's parents.
- What do we do now?
- I'm not sure, but I I think there's a possibility that Sophia might be right.
Maybe Emily has been abandoned.
Yes, officer, that's correct.
We've been trying to reach them all afternoon.
Sure, I can hold.
Every time I turn around, you're holding the baby.
It's amazing.
Every time I pick her up, she goes to sleep.
Don't.
The baby won't get used to sleeping alone.
You never get used to sleeping alone.
I haven't.
Please.
Siamese twins sleep alone more than you do.
- Who are you on the phone with?
- The police, about the baby.
I see.
No, no, no.
No problem.
And that's the standard procedure?
We'll have to discuss it and come to a decision.
- Thank you.
- What did he say?
He said that since Emily's parents left her in our care, we have two options.
We can wait for the Children's Protective Services to call, which takes 48 hours, or we can take her in.
Take her in?
Where?
Around the inseam, Rose.
To the police.
Why should we take her to jail?
She hasn't done anything.
Just because her parents abandoned her, does that mean we should, too?
Being abandoned is the worst.
I know.
I was almost abandoned.
- Almost?
- I was nine.
It was the last night of the Deep-Root Vegetable Carnival, and I was having the greatest time.
Eating candied turnips, guessing how many sweet potatoes were in the glass jar.
Bobbing for yams.
I had a knack of always coming up with the firmest, most appealing yams.
I was once told I had the firmest, most appealing gams.
Blanche, try and stay with us.
Anyway, the last time I surfaced, clutching a humdinger of a yam between my teeth, my parents were gone.
Frantically, I searched the carnival grounds.
I was convinced I'd spend the rest of my days with the bearded lady as my foster mother, and the man who hoses down the elephants as my dad.
Anyway, I was lost.
And scared.
But then I did what generations before me had done.
I gazed up into that dark night sky and found the bright star that could guide me home.
- The North Star.
- Actually, it was the Texaco star.
From a service station across the street.
Our farm was just down the road from it.
Rose, have you been washing the fruit off before you eat it?
Listen, we have a decision to make.
What do we do about Emily?
Nobody can raise this baby better than we can.
Fine.
But if she's gonna stay another couple of days, we'd better get more diapers and food.
- I'm thawing some pork chops.
- Honey.
She only has two teeth.
How is she supposed to eat a pork chop?
Uncle Lester only had one tooth, and he could eat corn on the cob.
Of course, he didn't get a lot of it into his mouth.
So they'd cream what fell on his pants, and he'd eat it later.
You two go to the store.
I'll stay here with Emily.
Let's go to that all-night market on Maple.
Good idea, Dorothy.
Do you think it's open?
- That's what all-night usually means.
- Of course.
Creamed what was left on his pants?
We ought to go to that all-night market more often.
Why, Rose?
They're so much more expensive.
Maybe so, but where else can you get beef jerky and Family Circle this time of night?
Girls, please, keep it down.
The baby's asleep.
Isn't this amazing?
When the diapers get dirty, the cute teddy bears disappear.
That's not amazing.
Whenever my kids' diapers got dirty, my husband disappeared.
I used to love to change diapers.
Face it, Rose.
You march to a different drummer.
I didn't hate changing diapers, but I was never any good at it.
Especially with the boys.
They always had dry bottoms but wet T-shirts, cos I forgot to point their little ooh-hoos south.
I didn't even think about that until Michael was at least six months old.
What's an ooh-hoo?
It's a chocolate soft drink.
I never had one.
You know, if we had to, we could do a good job of raising Emily.
I don't know if we'd have the energy.
But we'd find it easier, after all we've been through.
- What have we been through?
- Yellowstone Park, Rose.
Raising children.
My mother always used to say, "The older you get, the better you get.
Unless you're a banana".
I think we ought to call up those Child Services people and tell them we want to raise Emily ourselves.
Don't be crazy.
I only said that hypothetically.
That if we had to, we could probably do it.
I didn't get to do those things with my kids.
I had a nanny do all that for me.
My child woke up on Christmas and went running to his nanny.
Children do that sort of thing, Blanche.
How about when they're 21, and still don't come to you because they think you weren't there for 'em?
I have a pretty tough time living with that, you know.
And I just intend to make damn sure that if the time ever comes, there's gonna be somebody there for Emily.
Darling.
No, no, no, no, sweetheart.
Precious, don't cry, don't cry.
I'm here.
I'm here.
You're all right, you're all right.
You know, this reminds me of when I was a young mother.
Maybe it's because you look just a tad like my children.
Or maybe it's because I still look like I'm 27.
My, how those years did fly by.
Before I knew it, the children were cleaning out the attic for their own places.
While I tried to be happy for them, I was sadder than I ever remember being.
Why?
I realized, too late, that I'd put myself ahead of my children.
I've never made up all the time I didn't spend with them.
Why am I telling you this?
I don't know.
Maybe it's because, deep down, I wish you were really mine.
So I could try it again with what I now know.
- Is Emily all right?
- Yes.
We're going to eat.
How do you know she wants to?
She's licking her lips and staring at my chest.
Let's go in the kitchen so we don't wake Ma.
You're not gonna wake Sophia.
She is exhausted.
I didn't hear her, but I did hear Emily.
It's a lot nicer having a baby wake you up than a garbage man.
I never slept with one, I wouldn't know.
and you can't keep the kid quiet?
- What do you think she needs?
- A chin.
Ma, babies don't have chins.
It makes it easier to breast-feed.
You had a chin.
But then, we also showed home movies on your forehead.
- How are you feeling, Sophia?
- My ear hurts.
You were in a walkathon.
Why should your ear hurt?
Talking on the phone to hundreds of well-wishers.
I'm a sports celebrity.
- Who could that be at this hour?
- Who do you think?
The paparazzi.
Now I know why Sean Penn gets so ticked off.
- Can I help you?
- Hi, I'm here to pick up Emily.
Child Services said we could keep her till Monday.
I'm not from Child Services.
I'm Emily's father.
- How do I know that?
- I can see the resemblance.
Neither one of them can tell time.
Where the hell have you been?
You dropped this child off yesterday and you didn't call.
- This is not a dry-cleaners.
- I did call.
Last night.
A woman said she'd just won the Ironman Triathlon.
I don't remember this guy calling.
You don't remember?
I couldn't pick up Emily.
My wife just had triplets.
Triplets?
I thought you said she had gimlets.
I figured if she wants to drink, it's her business.
- Your wife had triplets?
- What are they?
When three babies are born at the same time.
Look, I appreciate you all taking care of Emily.
Sorry if I caused any trouble.
She was no trouble.
She was a precious little angel.
It's time to go home now, Emily.
- It has been nice having you.
- Thanks again.
- You're welcome.
- Good luck.
Bye-bye, Emily.
- Blanche - I'm fine.
You didn't really think she could stay with us, did you?
No.
She was just my last chance to prove that I could be a good mother and a friend.
No, she wasn't, Blanche.
Honey, you're still a mother.
Even though your kids are grown up act like they don't need you, they do.
I'm not so sure about that, Dorothy.
You're right, Dorothy.
And I'll tell you something else.
A mother sometimes needs her children even more.
Thank you, Ma.
That's very sweet.
- Give me $20.
- No.
Rose, did I say a mother needs a child?
I meant roommate.
- Give me $20.
- What for?
Seoul, Korea, 1988.
The Olympics.
I'd like to compete for the USA.
Contribute now, and I'll get you a Sophia lapel pin.
OK.
- Good luck.
We'll be watching.
- Thanks.
Dorothy, if Gladys calls, I can make bingo tonight.
Hello?
Janet?
This is Momma.
Hi.
Nothing's wrong.
Do I have to have a reason to call you?
I just thought I'd call, see how you're doing.
Really?
That's great.
You know, Janet, I was thinking.
Maybe I could just sneak away for a few days and come see you.
Middle of next week, maybe.
No, no, I understand.
I understand.
How about how about the next week?
Then you pick a time.
Honey, I really do want to see you.
I think we have a lot to talk about, Janet.
I've been thinking a lot about you lately.
You mean this coming weekend?
Sure I can.
All right.
All right, I'll see you then.
Janet?
I love you, baby.
Bye-bye.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
- Sophia, what are you doing up?
- I'm cooking.
I couldn't sleep.
Me neither.
What are you making?
Sausage and peppers, pasta pesto, and ziti with oil and garlic.
- And what's this?
- Garbage.
Rose cooked it.
This kitchen smells terrific.
My chipped beef must be done.
Sophia, would you like a scoop on some lightly-toasted bread.
Do I look like Beetle Bailey?
Ma, guess who I was on the phone with.
- Uncle Vito.
- How did you know?
I picked it up and listened.
It's a little thing I do.
My Uncle Vito is coming to Miami and he's staying with us.
He arrives Thursday.
He's staying a whole week.
- Where's he gonna stay?
- My room.
I'll sleep with Ma.
I was staying with you.
My cousin Milo's coming, don't you remember?
He's gonna be in town for the 14th Annual Hog Expo.
Is it the 14th Annual already?
It seems just like yesterday it was the 12th Annual.
Sunrise, sunset - Sunrise, sunset.
- Dorothy, now cut it out.
What are we going to do?
We'll figure out some arrangements.
We always make do.
Everything'll work out fine as long as I do not have to sleep with Rose.
Me?
Why don't you want to?
Honey, for starters, you talk in your sleep.
Let's face it, you're no Dick Cavett awake.
I do not talk in my sleep.
Yes, you do too.
And you snore.
No, I don't.
Dorothy snores.
Right.
Dorothy, you snore worse than a sailor passed out at an adult motel after a night of unbridled passion while I called a cab to take me ho Never mind.
The point is, you snore.
None of you is a day at the beach.
Remember when we had that cold snap and the heat gave out?
What a night.
Salvadore, if you wanna fool around, take off your T-shirt.
You're gonna get linguine all over me.
Ma.
Ma, go back to sleep.
It's just me.
Dorothy.
Get the hell out of my bed.
Ma, have a heart.
The heat went out again.
I'm freezing to death.
You're the only one with an electric blanket.
I'll die under here with you.
You're like a heat sponge.
You'll suck up the heat and I'll get up a frozen fish stick.
Don't be ridiculous.
Turn up the heat.
It's already on nine.
On ten you can cook a Lean Cuisine.
Good night, Ma.
You know, Ma, this reminds me of the time the heat went out in our apartment in Brooklyn.
I was about seven years old, cos I was still sleeping with my rag doll Mrs Doolittle.
I woke up in the night with my teeth chattering.
I got out of bed and tiptoed to your bedroom door.
I opened it a crack and I whispered, "Mommy, Mrs Doolittle is cold".
"Mommy, Mrs Doolittle".
- Dorothy?
- Yes, Ma.
Cut the crap, I'm not in the mood.
Girls, girls, can I please share your electric blanket?
- No.
- Come on.
I can't sleep.
My bed's never been so cold.
Specially on a Saturday night.
All right.
Get in.
Did you hear that sound?
Yeah.
In my own bed, I'll do what I want.
I meant it sounded like the heat kicking on.
Thank God.
Get back to your own beds.
- Everybody.
- What are you doing?
Trying to get the heater to work.
Rose, you're a genius.
Boy, that's a sentence you don't hear every day.
She's working great now except for one little thing.
I turned the air conditioner on and now it won't go off.
Great.
It's going to be colder inside than it is outside.
You're right.
There's an icicle forming on the nose of my bunny slippers.
Move over.
There.
That's not so bad.
Get your bunny nose out of my butt.
- Let's just get some sleep.
- Good night, Ma.
Good night, Moe.
Good night, Larry.
I can't sleep.
I'm on the wrong side of the bed.
I usually sleep on the right and I wanna be on the right.
What the hell is everyone so particular about?
In Sicily, four in a bed is a treat.
It means half your family is on vacation.
I slept with my two brothers until I was 17.
I was engaged to one for a short period of time.
But that's a separate story.
I wouldn't mind hearing it.
Rose, shut up.
Everybody, stay where you are and go to sleep.
I have to go to work early in the morning.
Darn, I forgot something.
Go in your pyjamas.
No, it's not that.
I forgot to say my prayers.
Rose, God wouldn't mind if you skipped a night.
He's very busy these days.
Most of his free time is spent talking to Pat Robertson.
Hello, God, it's me.
Rose Nylund.
Sorry to get in touch so late.
I hope I didn't wake you.
Oh, God.
One at a time, Blanche.
Anyway, I just wanted to say I think you're still doing a terrific job.
Course, there's some things I don't understand.
Like poverty.
And the spokesmodel category on Star Search.
But then again, you work your wonders in mysterious ways.
A couple of years ago, on a night like this, I'd have frozen to death cos I was by myself.
Now I have Dorothy and Blanche and Sophia to keep me warm.
Not just on a cold winter's night, but all year long.
Take care of them, God.
If anything happened, I just Rose, thanks for the lovely prayer.
Now shut up and get into bed.
Amen.
- Nice work, Dorothy.
- Wasn't me.
Sweet Jesus, am I in trouble.
Now I lay me down to sleep You know, I'd almost forgotten about that night.
With all of us cramped into that bed, I had to sleep in positions I never thought possible.
Me too.
- When will the food be ready?
- My chipped beef is ready.
- I wanted something hot.
- Mine's hot.
- I wanted something spicy.
- Mine's spicy.
She wanted something that wouldn't test her gag reflex.
I'll fix you a plate of mine.
I'll try some of yours, Rose.
Coming right up.
I hate thunderstorms.
They make me a nervous wreck.
That's another reason I can't bunk with you.
Everything makes you nervous and when you're nervous, you get unbearable.
You remember that awful night you barged into my room like a lunatic?
I was ready to kill you.
Come in.
Blanche.
I heard on the radio two killers escaped from the Georgia State Penitentiary.
- So?
- So.
They could be heading here.
Honey, they escaped in Georgia.
- Why would they come to Miami?
- For the same reason we did.
Eligible men?
I'm sure there's nothing to worry about.
I just thought you ought to know.
I appreciate it.
I won't bother you again.
Good night.
Please, Blanche, please.
I'm too scared to go back to my room.
This kind of thing has frightened me since I was a girl, when I first heard my parents whispering about the St. Olaf slasher.
Slasher?
Yes.
He terrorised St. Olaf for months.
In the dark of night, he'd sneak into an unsuspecting farmer's field and mercilessly slash his scarecrow to shreds.
He was a scarecrow slasher?
Primarily.
Although he was suspected in the disfigurement of several whisk brooms.
I was so scared, I'd sleep in the closet.
Rose, get into bed but don't say another word.
You'll never even know I'm here.
Fine.
- When are you coming to bed?
- In a minute.
What are you doing?
I am contouring my eyebrows.
I use Miss Christie Brinkley as a guide cos we have the same bone structure.
I hope she doesn't go to pot after that baby comes.
I don't want that big-eyed husband of hers coming after me.
I never do very much with my eyebrows.
That's why, from the nose up, you look like Wilfred Brimley.
Don't say another word.
Just go to sleep.
- Can I leave my light on?
- All right, yes, yes.
I want you to know, I really appreciate this.
Did I just say go to sleep?
I can't, I'm too scared.
- Tell me a story.
- What?
It worked when I was little.
- I don't know any stories.
- Make one up.
All right.
Once upon a time - there were three bears.
- Not that.
- Pigs.
- No.
Elephants.
They lived with a girl named Rose.
The elephants lived in the house?
They were elephant dolls.
When Rose went to bed she'd take the elephants because they made her feel so safe.
- Elephant dolls?
- Right.
Elephant dolls.
Until they got so tired of Rose annoying them that they went to sleep someplace else.
And two escaped convicts snuck in and murdered Rose in her sleep.
Rose.
Rose.
Grow up.
Sophia, that ziti was delicious.
Please, tell me something I don't know.
Dorothy, you didn't even taste my chipped beef.
Of course I did, Rose.
- You didn't like it.
- That's ridiculous.
I loved it.
Then, have another bite.
Okay.
The power lines must be down.
Great.
I've got 10Ibs of fresh clams in the refrigerator.
Rose, that was delicious.
Thank you.
Who moved my purse?
Why does it feel so heavy?
Now, listen, you know, we have these people who are coming to visit and we still haven't decided on our sleeping arrangements.
- I'll sleep with Sophia.
- No, I should sleep with Ma.
We've done it many times before.
We always get along fine.
Except when you're sick, like when you had bronchitis.
Honey, I was really ill.
Cool as a cucumber, thank God.
Ma, you woke me up.
It's time to take your medicine.
I just took my medicine.
You took it after dinner, then you fell asleep.
Read me how much you're supposed to take.
I don't remember.
- Two teaspoons every six hours.
- That's wrong.
It's here in black and white.
The pharmacist made a mistake.
He's not perfect.
If he knew what he was doing, he'd be a doctor instead of dressing like one.
Give me a break.
I'll take my medicine later.
- You're a lousy patient.
- What do you want from me?
- I'm sick.
- I don't know that?
You think I sat here for three nights just to look at you?
Believe me, you're no oil painting.
I've been here because I thought you needed me.
You needed me when you had the mumps, the chickenpox, whooping cough, rubella.
Or was Rubella our cleaning lady?
It doesn't matter.
The point is, it hurts me to see my baby sick.
But if I'm only being a nuisance, I'll leave you alone.
Come on, Ma, wait.
Ma, no, don't.
Ma.
Ma, don't go.
Ma, Ma.
Please.
Come back here, Ma.
I do need you.
I do need you.
I'm sorry, I'm just cranky.
You're right.
I am a lousy patient.
I always have been.
I remember when I was a little girl and I used to get those terrible chest colds.
And you'd whip up a batch of that homemade liniment to rub on my chest.
That was nasty stuff.
Cod-liver oil, garlic, petroleum jelly, parsley.
I remember once I asked you, "Why parsley"?
You said, "Presentation is very important".
Whenever I saw you coming down the hall with that ceramic bowl and a paintbrush, I'd run and hide under my bed and cry.
Then you'd rub some on my doll, Mrs Doolittle, to show me that it didn't hurt.
I'd come out from under the bed and you'd put it on my chest.
Next day I'd always feel better.
You remember, Ma?
Good night, Ma.
Thanks for everything.
I heard every word.
I wasn't asleep.
Just resting my eyes so you'd leave me alone.
I did that with your father.
It only worked about half of the time.
Asleep, awake, it didn't matter to him.
Men are built that way.
It's a fact.
Dr Art Ulene explained it on the Today Show with a plastic model.
Please, Ma, you slept like a baby.
I know because I spent the whole night awake in that chair.
It couldn't be worse than sleeping on a wooden bench in the middle of a railway station.
Boy, you do it anyplace, don't you, Blanche?
Blanche is talking about coming back from Edna McCarthy's funeral.
Edna McCarthy is dead?
My God, that's terrible.
I just sent her a chain letter.
There's a dollar I'll never see.
What a terrible night that was.
We were trying to make a connection to get back to Miami.
We only have ten minutes to catch our train.
I can't take another three hours on a train.
I'm looking forward to it.
But then again, I've always loved trains.
Excuse me.
What track does the 9:15 to Miami leave on?
Ma'am, we've only got one track.
But we call it track 19.
Nobody knows why, but it gives everybody something to talk about while they're waiting on the next tornado to hit their mobile home.
Thank you very much.
And please say hello to Opie and Aunt Bee for me.
Let's wait on the platform.
It'll be along in a minute.
The 9:15 to Miami left at 8:45.
How could our train have left a half hour early?
All the trains out of Apalapachoby leave early.
That's what our town's famous for.
Y'all may think this sounds kinda silly, but we actually printed "Our trains leave early" right on the town seal.
You have a town seal?
Can he play a song on those horns?
No, but he'll balance a ball on his nose if you throw him a catfish.
This is like The Twilight Zone.
Somehow we got on a train that ended up inside Rose's mind.
Yeah, when is the next train to Miami?
We've got one scheduled to leave at 6am tomorrow morning.
Does that mean it'll actually leave at 5:30?
Welcome to Apalapachoby.
I don't believe this.
This has to be the most depressing day of my life.
First, Edna McCarthy's funeral, now this.
Being at her funeral made me think about how quickly life can pass you by.
Maybe I ought to be more adventurous.
More adventurous?
The Kamasutra had to publish a supplement because of you.
I don't mean men, I mean things I've always wanted to do, but never got around to trying.
Dorothy, didn't you have something you wanted to do, some secret desire you kept on the back burner?
I always wanted to try a nudist camp.
Some big pots belong on the back burner.
Don't you have a cousin you should be dating?
Wait a minute.
You said there weren't any trains until morning.
No more trains to Miami.
That's the 9:20 to Sarasota.
Maybe we should try and get some sleep.
I won't be able to sleep.
I'm too depressed.
Me too.
This has been a terrible day.
A friend's funeral, stuck in a station in the middle of nowhere, trying to sleep on a wooden bench.
I don't think I have ever been this depressed in my entire life.
Rose, take off some of that make-up before you go to sleep.
What?
I don't believe it.
A circus.
Where did they come from?
The 9:20 to Sarasota's a circus train.
Girls, this is a miracle.
Our paths crossed here so they could cheer us up.
Excuse me.
Mr Clown.
Could you do something to put smiles on the faces of three Gloomy Guses?
Buzz off, lady.
I'm on a cigarette break.
What a terrible night that was.
It wasn't so bad.
Something good came out of it.
I dated Floppo the clown for several months after that.
You know, his feet really were that big.
Which, of course, as I'm sure you're both aware, means Ma, is there any more of that ziti?
There's not a drop of food left.
- Let's call it a night.
- Wait a minute.
What will we do about Milo and Vito?
They're family, they'll understand.
Let's chip in and put 'em up at the Holiday Inn.
- Sounds good to me.
- Me too.
What about you, Ma?
You know, in the right hands and the right bag, this chipped beef is not half bad.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
You will not believe what happened to to me.
I'm driving home, listening to my yodelling tapes, when the driver behind me starts furiously honking his horn.
I decide to be a lady and let him pass.
What does he do?
Pulls alongside, shouts obscenities that'd make Joan Rivers blush and then speeds off down the street.
- Rose, I got my own problems.
- Your own problems?
I can't find my lucky handkerchief.
- Lucky handkerchief?
- What are you?
A mynah bird?
I'm getting my kit together for a bingo game and it's not here.
Playing without it is like Kareem without his goggles.
I'm sorry, Sophia, I'm just so upset.
You would feel a lot better if you had shouted back.
I couldn't do that.
I get so flustered in those situations.
A well-chosen gesture can be very effective.
Something like this.
Sophia, isn't that obscene?
No.
They mean, "good health," "have a nice day" and "would you like to squeeze my concertina"?
You spent the afternoon together.
He didn't ask you out?
What did you do wrong?
- Who didn't ask you out?
- You got a phone book?
Frank Leahy, the teacher I've been working with on the youth fair.
Two weeks and he hasn't asked her out yet.
I don't know him know him.
We have spent exactly two Saturday mornings building display booths and painting signs.
We're hardly close.
You could be, if you'd ask him out.
He's too shy to ask you.
Maybe he just doesn't like her.
Thank you, Rose.
Incidentally, you look fat.
The time for subtlety has passed.
If you want this man, ask him out.
I don't know.
I feel so awkward asking a man out on a date.
You could invite him here to dinner, wouldn't seem as pushy.
Great idea, then we can all check him out.
- I don't think I can do it.
- Of course you can.
You be Frank.
I'll be you.
OK?
Why, Frank, you know I've been thinking, this is our third Saturday and I don't even know what you like to eat.
Come over for dinner this Saturday night and let me find out what whets your appetite.
And what are you serving for dessert, Blanche, penicillin?
I'll do it my own way.
If you do, you'd better use Jane Fonda's body, otherwise, it'll be just four of us for dinner.
Frank Frank, I'm sorry.
I was just going to say that the sign seemed a little high on one side.
- How about a coffee break?
- Sure.
When you get the chance, would you fix that sign?
Seems a little high on one side.
Yeah, sure, Frank.
I notice a lot of your students call you "Frank".
- You don't approve?
- No.
On the contrary.
Anything other than "Yo, Teach".
Is an educational breakthrough.
Formal titles can be very intimidating.
This way, I'm just one of the guys.
You think a lot of these kids.
- So do you.
- I do, but I sense a special dedication from you.
- It's nice.
- Thanks, Dorothy.
I've been at this a long time.
I know their families, been to their homes for dinner.
Really?
You've been to their homes for dinner?
They spread a newspaper on the floor for me.
I'm kidding.
You seem so amazed.
I'm not amazed.
I just think it's nice that you do that.
I just assumed that you knew that I ate dinner.
It's nice that you go to people's homes for dinner.
How would you like to go home with me?
I mean, for dinner.
Next week?
My roommates would love to meet you.
- What's a good night?
- Bingo night.
Or I'd have to introduce you to my mother.
But the table looked fine, right where we always keep it.
But with her complexion, those yellow garden lights make Dorothy look like Eric Severeid.
Look out, St Dominic's.
Sophia feels lucky tonight.
Tonight's the big bingo game, isn't it?
The biggest.
I got my lucky handkerchief.
I can't lose.
- Where did you find it?
- In my bra.
In your bra?
What was your lucky handkerchief doing in there?
I was blowing my breasts, Rose.
To give me cleavage, to turn on the butcher to get a decent piece of veal.
Now, if you'll excuse me, there's an electric weed whacker with my name on it.
When we go out there for dinner, sit on the far side and I'll sit next to you.
- Why?
- In case anyone wants to play footsie.
That sounds like fun.
I haven't played footsie in years.
- Charlie never - Rose.
Frank and Dorothy might play footsie.
- How do I look?
- Beautiful.
Go back and change.
That might be alright for a gay funeral in New Orleans, but it's too it's much too subtle for this evening.
Put on something flashy.
- Flashy.
Something colourful.
- That's really not me, Blanche.
I know, honey, but take a chance.
Be a woman.
It's an awful lot to ask, but I'll try.
Go.
Rose, come on.
Let's go see about supper.
Don't you think you might be pushing Dorothy a little hard?
No, and I need all your help.
She needs your help, too.
She won't have too many chances.
She doesn't have my beauty or your We'll help you next week.
The point is she glows every time she speaks his name.
Do you think Dorothy's in love?
She's very definitely smitten.
With help from us, she can fire Cupid's arrow into the tushie of love.
The "tushie of love"?
For some strange reason, I find that provocative.
You really ought to date more, Rose.
That must be him.
Heat up the rolls and cool yourself down.
Good evening.
Good evening, Father.
This must be an important cause.
Don't you usually make the nuns ask for money?
I'll get my purse.
I'm Frank.
I'm here to see Dorothy.
You're the hunk?
I mean Forgive me, Father.
That is, forgive my language, not in your official capacity.
I'm not even a Catholic.
I'm a Baptist and you can't forgive us Baptists.
Sweet Jesus, why am I babbling?
I meant that in all due reverence.
I never take the Lord's name in vain.
God.
Now I'm lying to a priest.
Why don't you come on in and sit down.
I'm Blanche.
Would you get the door?
Dorothy's told me a great deal about you.
Well, she left out one itty-bitty detail about you.
That I'm a priest?
She didn't know.
What'd she think?
You were just a boring dresser?
She's just never seen me in cleric's clothing.
I didn't know you priests could take your clothes off.
We do a lot of things real people do.
Except for one very important thing.
Boy, is that gonna put a hitch in Dorothy's plans.
Hello.
I'm Rose Nylund.
You must be Frank.
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Thank you.
Nice to meet you.
- Dorothy's talked about you for weeks.
- Rose.
Every time she mentions your name, she glows.
- Rose.
- I think she's very smitten.
Rose.
- He's a priest, isn't he?
- Yes, Rose.
I'm so sorry Hell Town was cancelled.
Frank, I'm sorry I Please tell me that's a Nehru jacket.
No, it's not.
Rose, let's go heat up the lasagne.
Come on.
Why didn't you tell me it was Father Leahy?
- I assumed you knew.
- No, I didn't.
I mean, frankly, I'm - I'm a little embarrassed.
- Me, too.
We can still be friends, can't we?
Of course we can.
I'm glad you're here.
Yeah, so am I. You look lovely tonight.
I look like the mother of a Solid Gold dancer.
Dorothy, I'm sorry about this misunderstanding.
I know.
I know.
It's alright.
OK, everybody, we're ready to serve the appetisers.
Come on, Frank.
We're eating out on the lanai.
Now, where am I supposed to sit?
Where you damn well please.
What difference does it make?
Go.
So first you were a teacher and then you became a priest.
First, I went to medical school for a year.
Then I quit and became an assistant basketball coach, then a teacher, then came the priesthood.
What do you think you'll do next?
Anybody care for more coffee?
I have another pot brewing.
Let me give you a hand.
Excuse me.
You know, black is your colour.
Did that influence your decision to enter the priesthood?
It wasn't the evening I'd planned, but it's turned out to be pleasant enough.
Frank is a very special person, isn't he?
Yes, he is and he obviously thinks the same about you.
Of course he does.
We're friends.
Dorothy, I hesitate to say this, but Something in Frank's eyes says he thinks of you as more than a friend.
Blanche, the man is a priest.
The man's a man.
I'm not listening to this.
I was in a similar situation once.
He was a man of the cloth.
Totally dedicated to his vocation or so he said, but his eyes told me he was dedicated to me.
We both knew it was wrong and we fought our feelings with every bone in our hot, longing, writhing bodies.
It was just too much for us and we checked into a Best Western.
You had an affair with a priest?
I said, "a man of the cloth".
He was a fabric salesman.
We never made love again, but he did cover my La-Z-Boy for free.
Wonderful, Blanche.
Something in his eyes says he wants you, in the biblical sense.
I will not listen to this.
The coffee's ready.
Ma, the bingo game's over already?
It wasn't a game.
It was a travesty.
They call four lousy numbers and, boom, Gloria's a winner.
Six more numbers, Kessler's jumping up and down, shouting, "I'm rich".
Of course she also does this on the boardwalk to attract men.
I think the whole thing was fixed.
That's why I'm gonna ask Hugh Downs to investigate.
I guess they sent you over to shut me up.
Ma, this is Father Leahy.
He had dinner with us tonight.
Pleased to meet you.
What happened to your date?
Father Leahy is her date.
Come here.
Dorothy, sometimes a mother gets a little busy and forgets to tell her daughter everything she needs to know.
So I'm telling you now.
Don't date a priest.
It's bad luck.
- Ma - Trust me on this one.
What happened to me at bingo tonight was no accident.
I didn't realise how late it was.
I should be going.
Thank you, all.
I had a wonderful time.
I'll see you on Saturday at the youth fair.
Dinner before then?
Something I want to talk about.
Sure.
What is it?
Thanks to you, I'm on the verge of making an important decision.
I'm thinking of leaving the Church.
Good night.
I thought I heard you up.
I couldn't sleep.
I had a horrible nightmare.
Tell it to me.
I'm awful good at interpreting dreams.
I was a contestant on The Dating Game and I won.
I went to meet the bachelor who picked me and it was the Pope.
That is a tough one.
Where did you go on the date?
Forget it, forget it.
Good night, Blanche.
What are you doing?
I thought you were asleep.
Provisions.
I figured we'd be up all night talking.
- I'm going.
- She don't feel like talking.
But I got chocolate macadamia-nut cheesecake and rum-raisin ice cream.
Alright.
Start cutting.
You scoop.
That's my girl.
Did you decide what you're gonna do?
No.
My luck.
The first really wonderful guy I've met in a long time and he turns out to have a more serious involvement.
- With whom?
- Pam Dawber.
The Church.
Or he did until he met me.
Take the religious aspect out of this and it's romantic.
Giving up everything for the woman he loves, like the Duke of Windsor.
Or the story of Rose and Charlie Nylund.
When I think of one, I automatically think of the other.
When Charlie and I started dating, I felt his folks didn't like me.
That's when I decided to get to the bottom of things and the ancient feud between the Nylunds and the Gorkleknabygens.
That was my mother's maiden name.
Gorkleknabygen?
Originally, it was Gorkleknabygen-Höffstädlerfeil.
But they shortened it.
Most of my mother's family were in show business.
Anyway, when Charlie told them we were gonna get married, they forbade it.
They said they'd disown him if he married - A Gorkleknabygen.
- Right.
He'd lose his share of the family tile grout fortune.
He didn't care.
He told them he loved me more than grout.
Must have been a tough choice for old Charlie.
I thought I heard voices.
Only two of them are God-fearing.
Ma, get off my back.
I feel bad enough.
What about me?
even when the Pope said I didn't have to.
I go to Mass, I light candles, and for what?
To be flushed down the toilet, because my daughter dates Father Happy Pants.
Ma, you're not making it any easier.
Look, Dorothy, in the end, only you can decide what's right for you.
Whatever decision it is, I'll stand by you.
- Thanks, Ma.
- Just remember, make the wrong decision, you'll burn in hell forever.
Sleep tight, pussycat.
I'm not here to confess, I did that a day ago.
At my age, how much can I sin?
I had an impure thought?
I'd kill to have an impure thought.
That would be two sins.
But now I'm telling you your business.
Let me get to the real point.
It's about you and my daughter.
I know everything and, frankly, I'm not thrilled.
If you wanna leave the priesthood, that's between you and the Vatican, but you should know about Dorothy, before you get carried away.
So, Frank, have you made your decision?
I can serve the Church better as a teaching priest at St Helen's, instead of a parish priest here.
We're gonna miss you around here.
Look, I know priests are men and they have urges.
What is it, lust?
It'll pass.
I do without.
You get used to it.
Get cable TV.
- Lots of luck.
- Thanks.
- Frank.
- Dorothy?
- What are you doing here?
- Free time between classes.
So you drove 18 miles across town?
OK.
I wanted to talk to you.
I didn't want to wait.
The thought that I might be responsible for the decision you're making is too much.
This is crazy.
It's not like you pushed me towards this decision.
You didn't know I was thinking about it.
Blanche did.
She saw it in your eyes.
- My eyes?
- You're a very special person.
I knew the moment I met you and you felt the same about me.
I can't tell you how flattering that is.
I mean, at this stage of a woman's life, to have someone instantly feel that spark for her is a dream come true.
Maybe in the dream he wouldn't be a priest, but that doesn't make it any the less flattering, but it does make it a lot more complicated.
So, Frank, you cannot go through with this.
- Dorothy.
- No, no, no.
It's a mistake that we would both regret for the rest of our lives.
No matter how strongly you feel, I cannot let you leave the priesthood for me.
What?
I understand how hurt you must feel.
Alright, maybe I don't understand exactly.
I'm sorry, Dorothy, but our relationship seems to be one misunderstanding after another.
Misunderstanding?
I'm not leaving the priesthood.
I'm leaving the Church, this church.
But Well If you're not leaving the priesthood, then I just made a complete ass of myself.
Excuse my language, Father, but, as an English teacher, I can tell you that's the most appropriate description.
- No, it's not.
- How can you say that?
I created an entire relationship in my imagination.
It wasn't in your imagination.
There is something special between us.
We appreciate each other.
You could help me see where I could do most good, as a teaching priest.
It's taken me a little while, but I think I've got it.
Alright.
Listen, your silence is deafening.
I didn't wanna whip this one out, but I have no choice.
She's been divorced.
You know the rulebook.
We're talking eternity here.
Are we still on for dinner Thursday night?
Yes.
Just so there won't be another misunderstanding, who is buying?
- How about a Dutch treat?
- Great.
See you Thursday.
Dorothy, thanks.
It's like you didn't hear a word I said!
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
This has been the NBC Nightly News with Tom Brokaw.
Please stay tuned for our next program in progress.
Gosh.
Wasn't that story about the heart transplant amazing?
I wasn't paying attention.
I was fantasising what Tom Brokaw looks like naked.
He must have sensed it.
I thought I saw him looking down your blouse.
Hi, Ma.
Hi, Tony.
We won the dance contest at the Sons Of Italy bar.
That's fantastic.
I had no idea you were such a dancer.
In the over-80s we were the only couple to do the mambo without a walker.
Don't believe her.
She has great moves.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- OK, Tony, take care.
Give me a break, would you?
Bye.
You really like Tony a lot.
He's the best catch in town.
He's got his own hair, his own teeth and a totally unrestricted driver's license.
At my age, that's like dating Tom Cruise.
- Hi, everybody.
- Hi, Rose.
- Hi.
- Rose?
Yes, Dorothy.
Is that a chicken you're carrying in that cage?
- I think it is.
See you.
- Rose.
- Before you all say no - No.
Please, just hear me out.
You've heard me speak about Sylvia Butell.
This is her chicken.
Sylvia Butell?
Isn't she the woman who thought Milton Berle was sending her secret messages through her dentures?
Yes, but with extensive counselling and some new bridgework, she's totally back to normal.
The woman keeps a chicken in her house.
How normal can she be?
- I kept a chicken in my home.
- You see my point?
I will not have that filthy beast in my house.
- It belongs in a barnyard.
- This is not a farm chicken.
Count Bessie is a showbiz chicken.
Wait till you see this.
A showbiz chicken?
What does she do, play the piano?
She plays the piano.
You just wait until you see this.
OK, honey, come on, it's showtime.
Yeah, come on, sweetheart.
I know.
Here we go.
OK, Count, hit it.
Isn't she incredible?
What do you say, girls?
Can she stay?
- I guess so.
All right.
- Thank you.
Just be sure and keep her in her cage.
Maybe I can convince the Count to give us some live entertainment with dessert.
Have you any requests?
How about Bye Bye Birdie?
Sometimes I get confused.
I want to make sure I have this absolutely right.
Rose works somewhere where they help people with mental problems?
- That's right, Ma.
- Can we contact Morley Safer?
I wonder who that could be.
Maybe it's the Count's clarinet player Henny Goodman.
Aunt Angela.
No, Sophia Loren.
I stopped using Oil of Olay.
- Angela.
- Sophia.
Hello there.
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.
You travelled 5,000 miles from Sicily for nothing?
I know.
The Valducci-Petrillo vendetta is still on.
Dorothy, buy a dozen mattresses, and some aluminium foil for the windows.
There is no vendetta.
There's not even a Valducci family anymore.
They ate some sausages that they shouldn't have at their last family picnic and they all died.
Food poisoning?
No, they stole the sausage from the Calabresi family.
So, what are you doing here?
I took a vacation to come and see you.
- Didn't you get my letter?
- No.
We never got a letter.
She never sent it.
She forgets.
- I don't forget anything.
- Hi, Angela.
- Hi, Blanche.
- No, I'm Blanche.
Isn't that confusing, having two Blanches in the same house?
Wouldn't you like to lie down?
You've had a long trip.
No.
I just got here.
I always get tired after a long trip.
I remember one time Daddy took the whole family cross state on our tractor to visit Great-grandfather Zingbarten.
Great-grandpa Ziggy was a famous inventor.
He developed the first, and to my knowledge, the only, low-voltage meter to detect what kind of centre pieces of candy had.
Anyway, we were just a few miles out You know, I am a little tired.
I think I will lie down.
- I'm tired myself.
- Me, too.
I'm exhausted.
Fine, but I'm warning you all right now, I'm telling the rest of that story as soon as you get up.
That was the best meal I've ever had.
You left half of it.
- I ate every bite.
- There's some sauce left.
If you really like it, you'll use bread to sop it all up.
- You can afford it.
- No.
I've put on a few pounds.
- You haven't noticed.
- Am I blind?
I can see that.
I meant the bread.
You can afford the bread.
It's only 89 cents a loaf.
Angela, sit down.
I'll serve dessert.
You two made such a fantastic meal, I can't imagine what dessert could be.
- I made dessert.
- Damn.
What'd you say, Blanche?
Yum, I said yum.
Rose, is this another one of those Scandinavian Viking concoctions?
Yes.
It's called gnurchen-frurgen cake.
It's an ancient recipe, but I Americanised it.
One might say you brought geflirchen-nirchen into the '80s?
Yes, but I'm not one to blow my own verturgen-furgen.
I can't even reach mine.
Have you had a chance to catch up on old times?
Angela filled me in on how my friends and family are doing.
- How is everybody, Angela?
- Dead.
Angela and I are the only two left of the original family.
That's terrible, Angela.
Does that mean you're all alone?
No, I have a goat.
Actually, I lead a very full life.
I get up, milk the goat, go to a funeral, come back, feed the goat.
Then I drink Chianti and I pass out.
It's a shame you and Ma don't live closer to each other.
Dorothy is right.
How many years do we have left?
We should live in the same town.
You want to come back to Sicily?
Am I a woman who beats her laundry on a rock?
You should move here, to Miami.
That's a great idea.
You'd love Miami.
- Angela, what do you say?
- I don't know.
I'm too old to move to a strange country.
What?
Before your husband died, you lived here for 30 years.
I don't know.
Think about it.
Who would you rather live with?
Your sister or a goat?
Give me a minute.
All right, I'll do it.
- Wonderful.
- Good for you.
While you're in Sicily, we'll look for a place for you to live.
Why should she make two trips?
She can stay here until we find her a place.
That sounds wonderful, I mean, if nobody minds.
Mind?
Why should we mind?
Dorothy, could I see you in the living room for a moment?
- Are you out of your mind?
- What?
Why did you invite my sister to live here?
You're the one who invited her to live in Miami.
Yeah, Miami the city, not Miami my house.
Am I missing something?
You don't know Angela like I do.
She always wanted whatever I had.
Even if she didn't want it.
She'll try to muscle in.
Come on.
I think you're overreacting.
Aunt Angela, where are you going?
I'll tape my name on the mailbox.
After all, I live here now.
Any more bright ideas, linguini-for-brains?
Hi, Rose, what you got there?
Just a little snack.
Darn, I forgot something.
Not bad.
What is it?
I'm not sure.
The pet store calls it Chicken Chow.
Maledizione, maledizione.
Ma, what's wrong now?
Living with Angela has been a nightmare.
She'll never leave.
- What has she done now?
- She used up my Porcelana.
Look at all these liver spots.
I've got more brown skin than the Temptations.
Ma, I'll get you another bottle.
At least try to get along with her.
I have tried.
Did I complain about sharing my bed?
- Yes.
- Or her using my Polygrip?
Yes.
Did I complain when she washed your sweater in a ditch?
- She ruined my sweater?
- Maybe I shouldn't say.
She's not going to be here that much longer.
I wish you'd try to be patient.
She's out right now looking at another place.
How many places has she seen in the past three weeks?
They're "too small," "not enough light," "no room for a goat".
She'll be here for ever.
Like I told you, whatever I have, she wants.
- How was the apartment?
- She liked it very much.
What's not to like?
Some lovely people live there.
- It's close to the beach.
- Are you going to take it?
It's kind of small and there's not enough light.
And there's no room for a goat.
Come on in the kitchen.
I made dinner.
It should be ready.
- I was gonna cook dinner.
- I thought, for a change, we'd have a meal with flavour.
I'm supposed to get along with that?
That smells great.
She probably defrosted something I already cooked.
Yeah, I did.
But I had to throw it out.
It smelt like it had gone bad.
It was probably no good.
You cooked it.
That does it.
Ma got something caught in her throat.
There.
That should take care of it.
We're out of fresh pepper.
Do you have any?
Yeah, in the pantry in the back.
Boy, this chicken looks great.
Girls.
Girls, Count Bessie is missing.
I went to the garage to feed her and her cage was empty.
Where could she be?
Aunt Angela.
Where did you get this chicken?
The garage.
I guess this means no live entertainment with dessert.
Rose.
Honey, you've got to stop torturing yourself like this.
- Now, Count Bessie is gone.
- I know.
It's just such a tragedy.
Who cooks a musician at the height of her career?
You've got to put this in perspective.
Count Bessie was a chicken.
Angela didn't fire up Doc Severinsen.
- How are you doing, Rose?
- Not very good.
You may not think so now, but in a few days you'll feel better.
No, I won't.
Mrs Butell will be back by then.
What am I supposed to say?
Welcome home.
How was your trip?
By the way, here's Count Bessie.
Rose, honey, think of the positive things.
Count Bessie accomplished more in a few years on this earth than most chickens do in a lifetime.
Give me a break.
I'm making this up as I go along.
Above all else, that chicken was a great entertainer.
And a great entertainer deserves to be remembered in a special way.
Yeah.
Like with a roast at the Friars Club.
I was only kidding.
- It was just a joke.
- And a pretty darn good one.
Rose, what have you got there?
Exhibit A. You know, I like Rose.
But when a woman throws herself on a chicken screaming "murderer", she's not playing with a full set of balls.
I'm getting out of here just in time.
- You found an apartment?
- Yeah.
I went down to the Senior Citizens' Centre this morning.
Decaf coffee, sodium-free bacon and a chest x-ray.
I saw some advertisements for roommates, so I picked out a few places and I found one I liked.
Isn't that wonderful?
My new roommate will come to help me move my stuff.
- Thief.
- What?
- What's that on your neck?
- A wart.
That's my necklace Momma gave me for confirmation.
- You always wanted it.
- I did not.
- Why take it?
- To cover the wart.
- Give me back my necklace.
- Come on, Ma.
No, no, no, come on.
Here.
Forget it.
She's accused me of stealing everything of hers that wasn't nailed down.
I'm sick of it.
I'm glad I'm moving.
- Moving?
- Angela found an apartment.
I know you hate me, so don't bother visiting.
Come on, you two.
Ma, she is your only sister.
OK.
All we've done is fight for three weeks.
How about a truce?
OK.
A truce.
Hi.
Hi, Tony.
- You know him?
- He's my boyfriend.
That's my new roommate.
I thought this address sounded familiar.
Boy, this is some coincidence.
This is no coincidence.
Everything I have, you try to steal.
May the bags under your eyes grow so large your head falls in 'em.
May your shampoo get mixed up with Preparation H and shrink your head to mushroom size.
Tony, the bag.
Come on, just try it.
It doesn't hurt.
See?
Hi, Dorothy.
Hi, Rose.
Rose, do you know offhand if 911 is the right number to call for a straitjacket?
- I can explain.
- I know you can.
That's the scary part.
You don't understand.
When Mrs Butell finds out about Count Bessie, she'll be devastated.
There'll be a void in her life, that only another musical chicken can fill.
If you're worried about voids, start with the one in your head.
Come on, honey.
Just a few notes.
Dorothy, do you believe it?
Four chickens and not one of them has any musical ability.
It's a sad commentary, Rose.
All the young chickens are wasting their time playing video games.
Can I make y'all some lunch?
Fruit salad.
That sounds good.
I'll get Sophia.
She has no appetite since she was stabbed in the back.
My God.
Who stabbed Sophia?
The chef at Benihana.
Angela.
Ma thinks that Angela tried to steal her boyfriend.
- And you don't?
- Of course not.
Don't be so sure, Dorothy.
Angela and Sophia are sisters.
Sisters have a natural adversarial relationship.
That's 'cause it's genetic.
It has to do with the double helix of the DNA molecule.
What?
I saw it on television.
Peter Marshall played this microbiologist on The Love Boat and he was conducting sinister experiments on the Landers sisters.
My apologies, Rose.
For a moment there, I didn't think it had been documented.
What is happening between Sophia and Angela is not unlike an incident between my sister Virginia and me when we were in high school.
Can you believe that one's very own sister could seduce her sibling's boyfriend on the eve of that sibling's senior prom?
- Virginia did that to you?
- No, I did that to Virginia.
She deserved it.
She borrowed my saddle shoes without asking.
What?
She scuffed those shoes.
I hardly left a mark on that boy.
I'll see you later.
I'm going over to Tony's.
- For lunch?
- No.
I called him.
He was in bed.
I heard female laughter.
It was Angela.
They're sleeping together, like I suspected.
I'm going to kill her.
I'll be back for Wheel Of Fortune.
Open up, tramp.
I know you're in there.
You can run but you can't hide.
Run?
I can barely walk.
Fine.
Rub it in.
What are you talking about?
You and Tony have been fooling around.
That's a lie.
I've been shopping all day.
- In your bath robe?
- I took a shower.
Kill me.
Why do you think I came over?
How will you do it?
Make me eat your ziti?
- Take that back.
- I will not.
May the hair on your lip get tangled with the hair from your nose.
May you take a diuretic and not be able to get your pantyhose off.
What's going on here?
Taking a shower?
I suppose this is your loofah sponge.
What are you talking about?
You toyed with my emotions.
You toyed with my affection.
You toyed with my sister.
That's not true, Sophia.
Angela's just my roommate.
You're the only woman in my life.
There can be no-one else but you, dear.
Tony.
Angela.
Boy, who is that woman?
This woman.
- She's my cleaning lady.
- What?
But I'm "the only woman in your life".
You've insulted my sister's honour.
I don't know what to say.
I'll tell you what to say.
Say "ouch".
- Say "that hurts".
- Say "please stop hitting me".
You two just started hitting him with your purses?
He was cheating on me.
In Sicily, if Uncle Bruno had heard about this, he'd have been in hot water.
- What would Uncle Bruno do?
- She just told you.
He would have put him in hot water.
Something good came out of this.
You two are close again.
Yeah, right now, but before long we'll be fighting again.
It's not that we don't love each other.
It's just our relationship.
- We get it from our mother.
- Our father.
- Shut up.
- You shut up.
- May your nose - Ma.
You're right.
You're right.
We get it from our father.
Now, Angela, there's something I want to give you.
Here.
That's the necklace Momma gave you.
I want you to have it.
It's my way of apologising for the way I acted.
Sophia, this is the nicest thing anybody ever gave me.
Don't get choked up.
It's only to hide that wart.
My God, it can't be.
It is.
Count Bessie.
Angela, that chicken you cooked the other night, didn't you get that from the garage?
- Yes, right.
- Out of a cage?
No, from the freezer.
Do you think I can kill a live chicken?
Am I Conan the Barbarian?
I must have left the door open and she wandered away.
I've got to get another apartment.
Aunt Angela, until you find a place, stay right here with us.
Dorothy, can I see you for a moment?
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
You scared me to death.
What are you doing?
Getting a close-up of your face.
I'm too close.
Did you have a poppy-seed bagel for breakfast?
Put that down.
What do you think you're doing?
Making a video for my class at the junior college.
Really?
It sounds like fun.
I'm glad you think so.
I want you as one of the stars.
I don't think so.
I'm uncomfortable in front of a camera.
Besides, I always come out looking like Fess Parker.
This is a documentary.
It's OK if you're not good-Iooking.
Rose, stop trying to appeal to my ego.
The answer is no.
Sophia, how would you like to star in my video?
Are there any nude love scenes?
No.
If it's integral to the plot, I'm happy to do it.
Dorothy, Sophia wants to be in my video.
Why won't you?
Dorothy's always been camera-shy.
You'd be, if you looked like Fess Parker in heels.
Blanche, how do you feel about performing in front of a video camera?
It's OK as long as you've had at least three dates.
It's for my video class.
My final project is A Day In The Life Of My Roommates.
Sure, honey, that sounds like fun.
Thank you, Blanche.
You're a real friend.
You and Sophia.
I'll just shoot around Dorothy.
Alright, alright, Rose, I'll do it.
But just don't shoot from too low.
Stan used to do that in our home movies and I always looked like someone from another planet.
She looked like Fess Parker from another planet.
I just got an invitation to the reunion of my college sorority, the Alpha Gams.
I belonged to a sorority when I was in college, the Alpha Yams.
It was an agricultural college.
I cannot wait to see my sorority sisters.
Scarlett and Melanie and all the rest of the girls.
It's gonna be exactly like old times.
Maybe not just exactly.
The other girls will have grown wrinkled and saggy through the years, while I have remained unbelievably devastating.
I cannot wait to go back there and rub their noses in it.
It's wonderful.
You make lifelong bonds when you join a sorority.
I never belonged to one.
I was blackballed.
I think that is so cruel.
The Alpha Yams didn't have blackballing.
We believed that any girl who wanted to help her community and foster a feeling of sisterhood - should be allowed to join.
- Very commendable.
As long as she could castrate a sheep.
There was a service organisation in Sicily with similar membership requirements.
Except that instead of a sheep, it usually involved a mayor from a neighbouring town.
Ma.
Some of Italy's finest sopranos were former mayors.
Hi, Rose.
Dorothy, you're supposed to pretend I'm not here.
Look, I'm sorry, Rose, but ever since you filmed me naked doing a pedicure, I've become slightly aware of your presence.
Dorothy, my child.
Sunshine of my life.
You got that in a close-up, Rose?
Why are you dressed like someone who just escaped from It's A Small World?
Come, my darling daughter.
Mother has made you your favourite breakfast.
Lasagne in meat sauce?
Doesn't it look delicious?
And think, for just $5.95, the recipe can be yours.
Hold it.
Stop.
Stop the camera.
Cut.
The director's the one who says when to cut.
Unless the actor is big and mad.
Ma, what is going on?
Dorothy, this could be my big chance.
With the exposure I get, I could hawk my recipes around the country.
That's ridiculous.
No.
If you wanna move your product, you gotta have exposure.
All the great Italian chefs had it.
Mamma Celeste, Chef Boyardee and Chef Balducci.
I don't remember Chef Balducci.
Right.
He didn't have television exposure, that was indecent exposure.
He should've stuffed cannelloni in the traditional manner.
Hi, girls.
What are you doing here?
I thought the reunion wasn't over till tomorrow.
No, it isn't.
I just decided I'd come home early.
Is there something wrong?
No, nothing.
Whatever gave you that idea?
As long as nothing's bothering you.
Should we defrost a loin of pork so you can scoop up the sauce?
I can't help it.
I'm so upset.
Seeing my sorority sisters was just dreadful.
Why?
It was as if time had stood still for 30 years.
Every woman looked wonderful.
They'd hardly aged at all.
I saw a movie like that once.
All the women were sucked up into flying saucers.
And mechanical doubles were sent back to earth to take their place.
Did any of them mention a leader named Zardos?
Rose, I'm saying they had all had face-lifts and they looked absolutely gorgeous.
It was the most disgusting spectacle I've ever witnessed in my life.
Wait a minute.
Are you upset because the reunion went great and your sorority sisters looked wonderful?
Of course not.
That would be childish.
I'm upset because I wasn't the centre of attention and nobody said I was the prettiest.
Come on now, Blanche.
What difference does it make?
Dorothy.
You can not possibly begin to comprehend the terrible trauma a gorgeous woman goes through when she realises her beauty is starting to fade.
And who do you see when you look at me?
Joe Pepitone?
All my life my beauty has outshone every other woman's.
But no more.
Now people are cuter than me, my life is over.
If you feel like that about it, you can get a face-lift, too.
I can't.
Surgery scares me to death.
That's out of the question.
You'll just have to grow old along with the rest of us.
I couldn't go on if I looked like you two.
You know, she had me in her corner right up until the end.
- Hi, Ma.
Want some tea?
- Nah, I'm trying to cut back.
Tea stains my dentures.
I had to soak them in Ajax.
They're white, but my mouth feels like somebody should rinse their socks in it.
- Glass of milk?
- Nah, it upsets my stomach.
- Orange juice?
- Too acidic.
- Can I get you anything?
- Cup of tea would be nice.
The rough-cut of my documentary is done for you to see.
Where's Blanche?
Where she's been for the past two days.
Locked in her room crying.
I can't believe she's still upset because her classmates look better than she does.
I can.
I tell you, her looks have always been very important to Blanche.
Blanche is a vain person and vanity is a terrible thing.
I should know.
I was vain myself.
You, Sophia?
You think I was born with white hair and a Play-Doh butt?
When I was a teenager, I was gorgeous.
Eyes as deep and black as ripe olives.
Skin as smooth and creamy as fresh butter.
Hair flaming red like a rich marinara sauce.
Ma, that's not you, that's your lasagne recipe.
Shut up.
Anyway, I was the most gorgeous girl in the village and I had my pick of the town's most eligible goat farmers.
Until Anna Maria Alonso Paladino, known to her friends as Muffin, moved to our village.
Suddenly, all the men, who were always fighting over who would keep the footprints I left in the mud, were after Muffin.
So, I decided Wait, just a minute.
They would fight over who kept the footprints you left in the mud?
It was a poor village, Dorothy.
What did you want them to collect, Fabergé eggs?
I was too vain to be the second-most beautiful girl in the village.
So, I went to Muffin and I told her how I felt.
That was when I found out that beautiful girl was even more beautiful inside.
She offered to move to the neighbouring village.
And you felt guilty 'cause you'd been vain.
Hell, no.
I helped her pack.
But it all backfired in my face because the next day, all the good-Iooking men followed her.
That's how I ended up with your father.
Boy, talk about learning a lesson the hard way.
Hi.
Hi, girls.
- How are you feeling?
- Much better.
I've decided I've been acting foolish about this whole thing.
I guess I still look pretty good.
Pretty good?
You look terrific.
I know.
I also decided to be a bit more modest.
But in this case that's lying, which is worse.
So, you're right.
I do look terrific.
Thank goodness that's over with.
I'm dying for your opinion on my movie.
It's ready.
I didn't do the soundtrack yet, but I got the editing done.
Remember, it'd be better with a bigger TV.
- We know.
- It'd be better with music.
- We understand.
- And it'd be better It would be better with Shelley Hack.
Turn it on.
Here goes.
That's Sophia walking into the kitchen.
I didn't know Fess Parker was in this picture.
- Ma, what are you doing?
- Mugging for the camera.
You're mugging me.
You're stealing money from my pocket.
I'm seeing if you have change for the bus.
Now I'm stealing.
My God.
Is that me?
I look awful.
- No, I was out of focus.
- You always are.
No, I look old.
I look decrepit.
I look ancient.
I look shrivelled up and wrinkled like a prune.
Could be worse.
She could look like Fess Parker.
- Turn that thing off right now.
- Blanche.
Blanche, Blanche, now calm down.
I'm just as calm as can be.
And you know why?
Because my worst suspicions have just been confirmed.
My good looks are fading.
The camera does not lie.
That leaves me with only one choice.
I am gonna be perfect.
I'm gonna be gorgeous.
I'm gonna have my tummy tucked and my butt firmed and my breasts raised and my face lifted.
It's a shame to do all that and keep that hairdo.
Here, Rose.
What do you think of Cheryl Tiegs' nose?
Very nice.
Kinda small.
Grandpa Nylund always said, "The air is free.
Have a big honker and suck up as much as you can".
Course, he looked like he'd caught a boomerang in his face.
- I like this.
I'm gonna get it.
- What are you getting?
I'm picking out the kind of face to show the plastic surgeon.
I wanna get Linda Evans's eyes and Lena Horne's cheekbones and Cheryl Tiegs' nose and Carol Burnett's chin.
You can get that chin through a catalogue.
If you put the pieces together, you see what the new me's gonna look like.
See, there.
What do you think?
Why is everyone looking at a picture of Gavin MacLeod?
No, this is a collage of the things I'm having done to my face.
You're going ahead with the surgery?
I am.
I'm looking forward to it.
I don't believe in it.
It's unnatural.
This from a woman who slept with a pig until she was 11.
If it makes you feel better to look better, there's nothing wrong with it.
I guess that looking good isn't important to me.
What are you talking about?
You wear make-up, have your nails done, colour your hair.
This is my hair's natural colour.
Yeah, and John Madden is a finicky eater.
You might have a point.
But plastic surgery is so drastic.
I'd be scared.
Believe me, honey, there is nothing to it.
It's not that bad.
Dorothy, have you had plastic surgery?
I don't believe it.
- What did you have done?
- My eyes.
Worth every penny.
Please, you spent $1,500, you go out on two dates a year.
I didn't do it for anybody else.
I did it for me.
Most people didn't know I'd had surgery.
But I knew.
It made me feel better about myself.
You were lucky.
It doesn't always work out that well.
It sure didn't for Olga Fetchik.
Just a minute, Rose.
Somebody give me a hand signal when she's finished.
Olga Fetchik was our town beautician.
And one of God's most unattractive creations since the aardvark.
Anyway, over the years, Olga had been secretly squirreling away money for plastic surgery.
One day she left without telling anyone, had the surgery and didn't return for months.
Nobody could believe their eyes.
Olga Fetchik had turned into a stunning beauty.
Every man in town wanted her.
She ended up marrying St. Olaf's most handsome and eligible bachelor, dance instructor Adolph Step.
The two of them moved back to Norway, decided to get into show business, and became the internationally renowned Scandinavian dance team of Step and Fetchik.
Rose, not that I care, but since you've already gone to so much trouble, just how did having plastic surgery ruin Olga's life?
It didn't ruin her life, it almost ruined St. Olaf.
After she left, the town didn't have a professional beautician for years.
Women started giving each other home perms.
Soon, everybody looked like Art Garfunkel.
Husbands stopped sleeping with their wives, the population started to go down.
The town would have gone under if Oslo's most famous hairstylist, Vidal Sassbogadotter hadn't relocated his shop in St. Olaf because of our more favourable tax laws.
Now, you see why I don't like plastic surgery?
What did you do that for?
Why should we be alone in pain?
You were saying, Rose?
Mrs Devereaux, come in, please.
I'm Dr Taylor.
- Pleased to meet you.
- Let's go over your form.
Fine.
Shall I disrobe here or do you have an examining room?
Your medical form that you filled out in the waiting room.
Sorry.
You are proposing some very extensive surgery here.
Eyes, nose, stomach And breasts.
These are from a magazine.
What do you think?
Very nice.
The angle's a little steep for my personal tastes.
But they certainly do make a statement.
Yes, they do, they say "big".
That's exactly what I want.
It just so happens that breasts are my specialty.
You have that in common with a linebacker on the Miami Dolphins.
As a matter of fact, I've worked on a few celebrities.
Tell me, what celebrities have you done?
Now, I can't tell you that.
That would be unethical.
Let's just say that some of my handiwork is prominently featured on NBC's Thursday night line-up.
- Now, Mrs Devereaux - Call me Blanche.
We're talking about tightening my behind and pumping up my bosoms.
We can be on a first-name basis.
Alright, Blanche.
But I think there's some things that you don't understand.
There are good reasons for having this kind of work done.
But there are also bad ones.
Plastic surgery will only improve your general appearance.
It won't make you perfect.
And, as with any surgery, there are risks involved.
There are absolutely no guarantees, no miracles.
Dr Taylor, you are not going to dissuade me from having this surgery.
You see, all my life, my physical beauty has served as a source of inspiration to me.
And to countless others.
But now that beauty seems to be fading and I'm scared.
I've never had to do without it and I don't know if I can.
I don't mind growing older, as long as I look the same.
There's no doubt.
I don't care about the risks.
I definitely intend to have this surgery.
Blanche, honey.
How are you?
You're probably uncomfortable now, but in a few days you'll feel fine.
Can we get you anything?
You've got yourself one hell of a lawsuit there, Blanche.
Was this a last-minute decision?
We're very sorry, sir.
Nurse, do you know what happened to Mrs Devereaux?
She cancelled her surgery.
She checked out this morning.
Sorry for the inconvenience, Mr. Diodoro.
It's time for your medication.
Diodoro?
Funny, he didn't look Italian.
- She's not out there.
- She isn't in her bedroom.
There's no one in the kitchen now, but the coffee's still warm.
Because we were drinking it less than an hour ago.
Excuse me, Miss Marple, I'm new at this.
- Where have you been?
- You had us worried sick.
I'm sorry, I thought I'd get home before you left.
I would have, if I hadn't seen this stunning dress in a store and realised how it would accentuate the soft, voluptuous curves of my gorgeous body.
Gorgeous body?
Yesterday it was a bag of russet potatoes with earrings.
That depends on how you look at it.
And Dr Gordon Taylor obviously looked at it with desire in his eyes.
He asked me out on Friday night.
So you cancelled the surgery for a date?
It wasn't any old date.
It was with a plastic surgeon.
Beauty is his stock in trade.
He can create any face, any body he wants.
What he wanted was mine.
That got me to thinking.
All my life I have had a unique charm that just kind of flowed naturally.
If I tampered with that, I could risk losing forever that special magic that is Blanche Devereaux.
That was a risk I was not willing to take.
That's why you decided not to have surgery.
No, I landed myself a doctor, so he can pay for it.
Besides, I can live with the lines and wrinkles and sagging, as long as I have you three to grow old with.
What a lovely thing to say.
Yeah.
Specially since no matter how old we get, I'll always be the youngest, and the prettiest and by far the most desirable.
You know, once again she had me in her corner right up until the end.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
- Hi, Sophia.
- Hi, Rose.
You're all dressed up.
Where are you going?
The President is in town.
I'm going to his hotel to see his wife.
I just loved her in Father Knows Best.
Sophia, you're a little confused, honey.
That was Jane Wyatt.
The President was married to Jane Wyman.
That old crow from Falcon Crest?
Well, they're not married anymore.
Now he's married to Nancy Davis.
- From All About Eve?
- That's Bette Davis.
Who beat her kids with wire hangers?
No, that was Joan Crawford.
The fat cop from Highway Patrol?
That was Broderick Crawford.
The President was married to Broderick Crawford?
And Mondale still lost?
What an idiot!
How does this dress look on me?
Why worry?
It'll soon be on the floor next to an empty Jack Daniel's bottle.
Blanche, I want to ask a question.
Who is the President married to?
- Nancy Reagan.
- Of course.
The one he helps out of helicopters.
This idiot thinks he's married to Broderick Crawford.
Get some help, Rose.
Blanche, that outfit sure is risquÃ©.
Oh, thank you!
Would you check my clasp?
Now, I just need those earrings you borrowed from me.
- I put them back in your room.
- Oh, no, not again?
- I didn't lose them.
- Oh, you lose everything.
You lost our tickets to see Julio Iglesias.
You misplaced two sets of house keys.
You couldn't find your car at the airport.
I didn't lose those earrings.
I'll find them.
Hurry up.
I'm due there at six o'clock.
We've still got plenty of time.
It's only Oh, sorry.
I forgot all about your tutoring session.
- OK.
We were just finishing.
- Hi, Blanche.
You look pretty.
You should see me with earrings.
So, what are you all doing?
- Algebra.
- Why do I have to learn that?
Because I had to learn to teach it!
I'm checking the grammar in Mario's story for English.
This is really terrific.
It's not terrific.
It's just OK.
It is much better than OK.
Blanche, listen.
Don't read it.
You'll embarrass me.
All right.
I'll just read it from there to there.
OK?
But then you'll miss the spirit of the whole piece.
Take it from here.
"On his first night in America, his uncle took him to a movie".
"He felt more excited than ever in his life, watching that movie, because of the feeling he got, sitting there with those other people, laughing together, getting scared together".
"He felt like they were his friends".
"To him, that feeling was the feeling of living in America".
"In America, you always felt like you were among friends".
Mario, that's just beautiful.
You should hear it when I read it.
- Hi, Rose.
- Hi, Mario.
How about a snack?
Sure.
I'm starving.
How about a herring sandwich on raisin bread?
Oh, I'm gonna miss my bus.
Your bus doesn't leave till See you tomorrow.
Bye, Rose, Blanche.
Adios, Teach.
Hasta maÃ±ana.
Maybe I should submit his story in the district contest.
I think you should.
He's a very special kid, Dorothy.
He really is.
I'm crazy about him.
He wants so much to learn.
He gets this look in his eyes when he's listening.
You don't see that very often.
I think that look is the whole reason that teachers teach.
Of course, there's a similar look that means, "I'm gonna slash your tires".
But an experienced teacher can tell the difference.
I'm going to a party tonight.
Can I borrow your earrings?
Of course, but why not wear your usual ones?
Would you like to field that one, Rose?
Blanche, I have looked all over the house.
I cannot find your earrings.
But I found the Julio Iglesias tickets.
Boy, we had great seats.
Blanche, I feel awful about this.
Oh, forget it.
I never intended to keep those earrings my entire life, like my momma did.
And my grandmomma.
And my great-grandmomma, who fashioned those earrings from the Civil War bullets that killed Great-Grandaddy.
- I'll make this up to you.
- Forget it.
No, I've already decided.
For one week I am going to be your personal videnfrogen.
Can one woman do that for another?
Only if they're the same height.
What the hell is a weedenfrurgen?
Videnfrogen.
It's a personal servant.
It's the only way to make up for this.
We've done it in my family for years.
Ever since Uncle Ben lost Lars Olsen's artificial leg.
It was the day of the big four-county toboggan race, and without his leg, Lars came in dead last.
That was a day to remember.
I think every American remembers where he was the day Lars lost that toboggan race.
Well, Uncle Ben felt just terrible.
I mean, Lars said he forgave him, but you could tell there were still hard feelings.
Lars kept trying to run Ben down with his bicycle.
But with only one leg, - how fast -  Could he pedal?
Well, finally, Uncle Ben suggested something to clear the air properly.
For one week, he would be Lars's personal videnfrogen, and do whatever Lars wanted.
Lars agreed, and it worked.
It always works.
So, won't you give it a try?
Fine, but not now.
I'm late for my date.
I'll grab those earrings.
See you later.
- I'd better see if I can help.
- Rose Listen.
I'm going to ask a question that I know I'll hate myself for asking, but whatever happened to Lars's missing leg?
They found it, at the annual Edelweiss and Jarlsberg Choral Festival.
Uncle had used it to beat off wolves when he set up the bleachers.
Just as I suspected.
Now I know why they say lying in the sun is dangerous.
Oh, Sophia, we've only been out here for a little while.
At your age you don't need to worry about wrinkles.
Who's talking about wrinkles?
I can't get up.
My butt is stuck to the chair.
- I'll help you.
- Oh, I'll do that.
- That's alright, Rose.
- That's what a servant is for.
I'm sorry.
I'm not comfortable having you work for me.
I am.
You wanna be my servant?
I'm not talking about big things.
It's about little things, like doing your laundry.
My laundry's more fun, Rose.
Then I'll feel better about losing your earrings.
Ever see panties from the '20s, Rose?
They got pockets.
Please, Blanche.
Oh, I just don't feel right.
You don't feel right?
Well, what about me?
What about the guilt that twists deeper and deeper inside me?
What about the tortured days and the sleepless nights I've spent thinking of some way to make up for this?
Oh, Blanche.
Don't be so selfish.
Let me be your videnfrogen.
All right.
Be my vleedenflugen.
Frogen.
Girls, terrific news!
Remember Mario's story that I submitted in the contest?
It won first prize!
Why, Dorothy, that's wonderful!
Anyway, I thought that tomorrow, when he comes for his lesson, I would give him a surprise party to celebrate.
Oh, that's a great idea!
I just love surprise parties.
Every year on my birthday, George took me to the Country Club, saying it would be a nice, quiet little dinner.
Then we'd walk into the dining room, and our friends, all from the finest families, would yell, "Surprise"!
And every year I'd pretend to be surprised.
It always made George so happy.
But how could you fake it every year?
Well, Dorothy, I faked it three times a week.
That always made George happy, too.
I've only been to one surprise party, but I'll never forget it.
It was for Grandma Nylund's She was from a whaling village, so we made that the theme.
We all dressed as Vikings, with helmets and spears.
And we all crowded into her little room over the barn, and she walked in and lit a candle.
And we yelled, "Surprise"!
And she dropped dead right there.
We all thought that was such a nice way to go.
Dorothy If I live to be 100, make me a promise.
I promise, Ma, no surprise party.
No, promise me a new apartment.
They make me crazy.
Well, I'd better start planning Mario's party.
- Let me plan it.
- Oh, you don't have to.
No, but I want to.
There's nothing I like better than planning a party.
- Sure?
- Yes, there's nothing to it.
Well, fine, thanks.
- Rose.
- Yes.
Plan the party.
I went as fast as I could.
You forgot the peanut-butter vanilla ice cream.
That's Mario's favorite.
I was sure chocolate was his favorite.
That's why I bought it.
Oh, my goodness me!
I think you're right.
Whose favorite is the peanut butter?
Oh, it must be mine!
Just put that in the freezer for me, would you, Rose?
Mmm, videnfrogens, what a lovely idea.
If we'd had them in the old days, we wouldn't have had that disruptive Civil War.
Has anyone seen today's paper?
Sophia left it on the lanai.
Just in time.
Rose, fetch the paper.
Okey-dokey.
Seems like you've gotten more comfortable giving Rose things to do.
Oh, well, deep down it still saddens me, but psychologically it's very important to Rose.
I just don't give her anything too demeaning.
Here.
Should I read it to you and massage your feet, like this morning?
No.
Just be a good videnfrogen and keep your mouth shut.
I've heard there's an article in here about Mario's winning the contest.
God, there's a picture, and I'm in it.
- Let's see.
- No, I look terrible.
Oh, come on.
You always think you look terrible in pictures.
Let's see it.
Now, that's ugly.
I think I hear him in the kitchen.
Come on.
Surprise!
Louder next time.
My heart's still beating.
Sorry, Ma.
We thought you were Mario.
You'll have to scream louder to kill him.
- Hi.
What's going on?
- Oh, Mario!
You spoiled our surprise.
Sorry.
I'll come in again, totally unsuspecting.
Here I come, suspecting nothing.
Surprise!
Oh, this is great!
What a surprise!
But it's not my birthday.
I know, honey.
We're celebrating your winning that contest.
Oh, wow!
Thank you.
We're so very, very proud of you.
And Dorothy says your friend Barbara was proud of you, too!
Yes?
- Dorothy Zbornak?
- Yes.
Burt Nesbitt.
I'm looking for Mario Sanchez.
- The school said he'd be here.
- Yes, he Is something wrong?
I'm with the Immigration And Naturalization Service.
We believe he's in this country illegally.
Mario?
You'll have to come with me.
I can't sleep.
I just keep lying there, thinking about Mario's face when he heard he might be deported.
-  Well - Might be, not will be.
Maybe the judge will let him stay.
But it's all my fault.
I probably got him kicked out of the country.
He was here illegally.
You can't blame yourself.
You just have to trust the justice system.
That's easy for you to say.
You're not responsible for what happened.
Well, I know just how Dorothy feels.
When I was young, I witnessed a horse theft on Grandaddy's plantation.
I screamed for help.
Grandaddy got on his stallion and rode the thief down.
Then, to teach me about justice, Grandaddy dragged that thief into court, with me as the star witness.
I had to testify in front of a packed courtroom.
You must have been terrified.
Oh, honey, I was.
I didn't know what to wear.
I only had two dresses.
One bright one, suitable for weddings or a cotillion, and one darker one, for funerals or a hanging.
See, my folks were poor.
I just had one of those reversible hanginglcotillion dresses.
Well, I picked the bright one.
Now, when I took the stand, a hush fell over that courtroom.
I told the judge what I'd seen, and after my testimony, that horse thief's fate was sealed.
Justice won the day!
What's that got to do with what's going on now?
Well, like any good story, mine was deliberately ambiguous, affording the listener the opportunity to glean from it whatever he may.
And I hate being left out of conversations.
Hello?
Yes.
No, he isn't.
What?
What?
Oh Oh, my God!
Yes, er all right.
All right.
-  What is it?
- Mario's uncle.
He's run away.
- Oh, no!
Where will he go?
- There's only one place I know.
Oh, wait a minute.
We'll go with you, Dorothy.
I can't see a thing.
What kind of a movie is this?
-  Rip his throat out!
- It's a musical, Rose.
I think that's Mario sitting down there in the front.
You girls stay here.
Oh, I just hate violent movies.
- Shhh!
- It's like watching an autopsy.
Shhh!
Is this seat taken?
Did I miss the part where he rips the guy's throat out?
You've seen this movie six times, so you shouldn't mind a few questions.
Does this mean you've decided to run away, instead of going to see that judge?
Well, I can't make you change your mind.
I can't even make you put an R in "February".
But I'd like to talk about it.
That judge will send me back.
He might not.
Some people come here and stay.
You're looking at one.
Arnold Schwarzenegger.
He became an American citizen, started a whole new career, married a Kennedy.
Right now he's tearing off another guy's arm and hitting him with it, but you do see my point?
I don't want to go back.
I know you don't, and I don't want you to go, either.
I wish I could say you won't have to, but I can't.
I promise you, though, that running away is not the answer.
- Aaaargh!
- Whoa!
Oh, I'm sorry, Mario.
I just I never realized that ripping off a nose would leave that big a hole.
Anyway, I read a story once that said that in America you always feel like you're among friends.
What do you think?
That was just a story.
It was a true story.
Will you see that judge with me?
Will you start putting an R in "February"?
OK.
Let's go home.
- OK, girls.
Let's go.
-  Good.
Blanche!
Dorothy, I just can't take my eyes off that man's body.
I want to see more.
He's covered with oil, wearing a loincloth.
How much more can you see?
I don't know, but I'm going down front to find out.
Whoa!
What time did Mario say he was coming?
When he hears from the judge.
Why couldn't that judge decide at the hearing?
I thought he was going to.
I spent 20 minutes giving him reasons why Mario should be allowed to stay.
He said "thank you" and excused us.
Blanche, I've made your lunch.
It's on the table.
- Won't you join me, Dorothy?
- Thanks.
It might take my mind off Mario.
- Did you make enough for three?
- Oh, yes.
Well, have yours when you've finished rotating my tires.
Yes?
Hi.
I'm Sam Burns.
I'm a friend of Blanche's.
- Oh, yeah, come in.
- No, don't bother.
I just wanted to drop something off.
I found these between the cushions of my love seat.
- Blanche's earrings!
- She left them there last week.
Oh, and er she er left her watch, too.
Her watch?
Thank you.
I'll see that she gets them.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Blanche, could you come out here?
- What's wrong, honey?
- Er that was Sam Burns.
He found these in his love seat.
- My earrings!
Thank you.
- Aren't we forgetting?
- What?
- An apology.
Oh, honey, you don't have to apologize for sleeping with Sam.
Everybody does.
Blanche Devereaux, you sit down and shut up and listen.
I didn't sleep with him or lose the earrings.
You did.
Along with my watch, which I didn't know you'd borrowed.
- I thought I said.
- No.
- I'm sorry.
- Well, "sorry" doesn't cut it.
I've been making your bed, your breakfast, your stinking tuna sandwiches with the crusts cut off.
And for what?
For nothing.
Well, it's all over.
You won't have this videnfrogen to kick around anymore.
What is all the shouting about?
I'll explain later.
Right now I have to pour on a little Southern charm.
And if that doesn't work, I might have to eat Yankee crow.
I don't like that look.
Bad news.
They're sending me back.
- Oh, Mario, I'm sorry.
- It's not your fault.
Oh, but it's just It's so unfair.
I can't believe it.
But we don't have to give up.
We'll fight this.
There are legal ways to keep you here, and tomorrow we'll find them.
- I have to go tomorrow.
- Then I'll do it myself, and we'll get you back here.
I promise.
- I'm gonna miss you.
- I'm gonna miss you, too.
Now, you keep up with your homework and tell me how you're doing.
I will.
I'll never forget you.
Huh!
You won't have time to.
You'll be back here before you know it.
This is your home, where you belong.
You're what this country is all about.
Say goodbye to Rose and Blanche for me.
OK.
Adios, Teach.
Mario So, I was doing it for your own good.
Treating you like a dog was really doing you a favor.
So, why don't we forget all about it?
OK?
Hmm?
- Mario's got to go home.
- Oh, Dorothy!
Oh - He asked me to say goodbye.
- Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.
Boy, I could sure use a family hug now.
Oh, darling!
Oh, honey.
Dorothy, you've had a rough day.
I'll tell you what.
Get into bed, and I'll bring you a hot chocolate.
- Oh, you needn't.
- I want to.
I'll bring some cookies and move the TV in.
- You don't have to bother.
- Oh, it's no bother.
Thanks.
You heard her, Blanche.
Get cracking.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Give me a break!
This is highway robbery.
I'm on a fixed income.
OK.
I'm desperate.
You got a deal.
60.
Oh, good news.
I got your date for the banquet.
- Ma, I'll get my own date.
- Fine, pay 100.
Here.
Help me finish these invitations.
Hi, girls.
Boy, am I stuffed!
I sampled food from over ten caterers.
- Find one for the banquet?
- Not yet.
Oh, but I did learn that baked Alaska can actually be cooked locally.
I have an even bigger scoop for you.
Mars bars are made right here on earth.
Oh, girls, this time I have really done it.
Thanks to me, the hospital charity banquet will be in the Bedford Hotel!
Blanche, the Committee is on a budget.
- I know.
I worked out a deal.
- We can't afford that room.
But I worked out a deal.
I told the manager, if we got that room, I'd persuade my sister to sing in his bar.
- You mean your sister Virginia?
- No, my sister Susan Anton.
Blanche, how could you tell such a lie?
He didn't believe me for a minute.
Said I was too attractive to be related to her.
But we got the room, cos he liked my moxie.
And you liked showing him it.
Well, we have a place.
Now we need a caterer.
One's dropping by this afternoon.
- Did you hire the band?
- Rose is supposed to.
I warn you, we may end up with the Hansger Flugenhaben Yodeling Quartet.
-  - Not true.
They broke up.
But the Sonia Van KÃ¼gel Tuba Band is free.
Hi.
I'm Jake Smollens from VIP Catering.
Hello.
I'm Rose Nylund from St Olaf, Minnesota.
These are my friends, Dorothy and Blanche.
Blanche Devereaux.
I am Chairman of the Planning Committee.
So, could you tell us something about your background?
Well, I've run VIP Catering for five years.
Before that I was a cook in the Navy.
I can cook beef for 1,500 or Chateaubriand for two.
No, Mr Smollens.
What I meant was, are you married?
No, I'm not, and please, call me Jake.
- Oh, my pleasure.
- I once had an Uncle Jake.
Of course, he could never cook.
He also could never get through our 4th of July picnics without unzipping his overalls.
Too bad your uncle can't make it to the banquet.
So, er tell me, Jake.
How much do you think these meals will cost?
Well, do you want something simple or fancy?
We want something cheap.
- I admire your honesty.
- I admire your chest.
I mean, er exactly what kind of meal are we talking about?
I could do a nice Yankee pot roast.
Mashed potatoes, mixed vegetables, wild green salad.
And for starters, my special, clam chowder.
No charge.
Mm-mm.
That sounds delicious.
Just consider yourself hired.
Now when shall I come to your place to sample what you have to offer?
I got a better idea.
There's a romantic diner on the Boardwalk.
They use my recipes.
I'll pick you up tomorrow, and we'll check out a few things.
- I thought you'd never ask!
- Swell.
- I'll see you tomorrow night.
- OK.
Nice meeting you, ladies.
- Nice meeting you.
- Our pleasure.
Wow!
What a hunk!
I know.
Eat your hearts out!
Did it ever occur to you that Rose or I might be interested in Jake?
Yes.
And you still used every ploy to nab him?
- Yes.
- Then what do you have to say?
Damn, I'm good.
Well, isn't this romantic?
Oh, yes, it certainly is if you happen to be Popeye.
Jake, what can I do for you?
- We'd like the best table.
- OK, buddy.
Oh, this is great.
Thanks.
And we'll have the usual.
Alright.
Is this really the best table?
- Did you get a splinter?
- No.
Then this is the best table.
- You're pulling my leg.
- I'd like to.
- Stop being naughty!
- Sorry.
I didn't mean that.
Neither did I. Be naughty again!
You're one hell of a woman.
I know.
Go on.
Well, in all my years in the Navy I've never met anybody like you.
Well, in all my years dating the Navy, I've never met anybody like you.
Erm Jake, is it my imagination, or is there a tattoo of a nose on your arm?
Yeah.
I got that when I first joined the Navy back in '51.
I was a kid.
I was drunk.
So was the tattooist.
I asked for a rose, he thought I said "nose".
- Oh, thanks.
- Thanks.
Well, Blanche - I really like being with you.
- I like being with you, too.
Mmm.
This looks delicious.
Now, before you eat that clam chowder, there's one thing.
What?
It tastes better if your lips are warmed up.
I see now why it's so romantic here.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And now, for my next number, I'll play something by one of my favorites and, I hope, one of yours.
Huey Lewis And The News!
Er I think we've heard enough, Mr Hinkley.
OK.
We go right to the big finale.
- I'm afraid we're out of time.
- But it's a real show-stopper.
I hold up two lit sparklers with my hands, and play Hey, Look Me Over with my feet.
- Smoking a cigarette?
- No?
Darn.
You were this close.
Goodbye.
Oh, we're in trouble.
We've auditioned a dozen musicians.
The banquet is two weeks away, and we've no band.
What do we do?
I'll tell you what we're gonna do, Rose.
We're gonna eat a cheesecake.
Hi, Ma.
Shouldn't you be finishing those invitations?
I'm here for some water.
Stamp-licking dries me out.
- Why don't you use a sponge?
- I'd rather drink from a glass.
Blanche, don't you and Jake have dinner reservations tonight?
Yes, we do.
He's late.
Well, he must have a good reason.
Anyway, who cares?
He is a dreamboat.
Yes, being with Jake has been wonderful, but I cannot get used to some things.
Really?
Like what?
Well, it's a question of breeding.
He uses fingers instead of his knife to eat.
Tucks his napkin into his collar.
Wears white after Labor Day.
Blanche, the man is a winner.
What's the matter with you?
I don't know.
Maybe I'm just overly critical.
That sometimes happens when you're stunningly beautiful.
Not to mention endlessly irritating.
Blanche, Jake's here.
Make yourself at home.
Don't touch anything.
- Hi, everybody.
- You are filthy!
I helped a lady stranded by the roadside, and ended up fixing her transmission.
Aren't there professionals who do that?
Andy Granatelli does.
Although he doesn't actually fix them himself.
Doesn't want to dirty his trench coat.
But I hear he has this special school I know: "Shut up, Rose".
Please, honey.
I'll make it up to you.
I'll pack a picnic basket and we'll drive to the beach.
I'll spread a blanket on the sand, take you in my arms I forgive you.
I mean I mean Blanche should forgive you.
Oh, alright.
I forgive you.
But forget the picnic.
I'll get us that blanket.
- He's a wonderful man.
- Oh, I know.
Why can't I ever attract men like that?
- You can, Dorothy.
- Oh, Ma, you really think so?
No, but you think I'm gonna tell you that?
Ma, did you mail all the invitations?
None of the Gs through the Ls has responded.
Sure, I took them in a shoebox to the post office.
- Unless - Unless what?
Unless I sent my best pair of heels overnight mail.
Ma, this is terrible!
You're telling me.
Now I don't have shoes for the party.
Girls, I am so excited!
We have a band.
- You hired somebody?
- Yep, The Great Pretenders.
It's an all-female jazz band.
They're supposed to be fantastic.
Well, now it's going to be a good party!
Oh, it's too bad you couldn't find a better date than Harvey.
Well, I wouldn't brag about my date, if I were you.
Incidentally, is Walter renting that blue tuxedo again?
Walter never rented a blue tuxedo, and you know it.
He owns that blue tuxedo.
Girls, did Jake call?
He is half an hour late.
No, Blanche.
Will Jake be able to take you to the banquet?
Well, he might be able to take me, but my date is Hunter McCoy.
- What about Jake?
- What about him?
Well, Jake has to take you.
You'll both be there.
He'll expect you to be there with him.
How could you do this?
Well, you make it sound so terrible.
It's not.
Jake just doesn't belong with certain people.
He's a blue-jeans kind of guy.
This is a black-tie affair.
We wouldn't have any fun.
Sometimes you act just like a woman I knew in St Olaf.
Please, no-one say, "What woman"?
Blanche, Jake is crazy about you.
You'll break his heart.
Honey, don't be silly.
Jake knows I care for him, but our relationship can only go so far.
-  - That's probably him.
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hello, everybody.
- Hi.
Is there somewhere we could be alone?
- Can't it wait till later?
- No.
Alright, I'm flexible.
But of course, you know that already!
No, no, no, no.
I want to ask you something now.
Right here, where we first met.
Erm Ma, Rose, why don't we go into the kitchen?
- What, and miss all this?
- Get up!
Listen.
I know what you want to ask me.
Now, I've been giving our relationship a great deal of thought, and I just think you're a wonderful man.
I love the time we spend together.
But we do come from two different worlds, you know, so our relationship can only go so far, and I can't go to the banquet with you.
Well That's not what I was gonna ask you, but you answered my question.
Why?
I don't understand.
I was gonna ask you to marry me.
Rose, what are you doing up?
I can't sleep.
I'm having nightmares about the banquet.
Oh?
What kind of nightmares?
I'm at the banquet.
It looks beautiful.
I look beautiful.
Everybody looks beautiful.
And suddenly Charlton Heston walks in, dressed like Moses.
And he tries to part the dessert table.
When that doesn't work, he rounds up the guests and leads them to the lingerie department of the nearest JCPenney's where everybody starts making fun of the fat-lady underwear.
What do you suppose it means?
That you've spent too many years sleeping on curlers.
Ma, you can't sleep, either?
No, I'm sleeping so good, I thought I'd come try it in the sink.
I guess everybody's a little jumpy about the banquet.
Except Blanche.
She could at least have the good taste to pretend she can't sleep.
She's probably nervous about running into Jake.
Sometimes, when people are under pressure, they sleep to escape.
Dorothy's father used to do that.
Unfortunately, it was usually during foreplay.
- Ma, the man is dead.
- Longer than you think.
I feel bad for Blanche.
She's been moping since she and Jake split.
Oh, don't expect me to feel sorry.
It's not often that somebody like Jake comes along, and she throws him away.
Oh, what's everybody doing up?
We were saying how dumb you were to give up Jake.
I'm so upset about it I can't sleep.
- Well, give him a call.
- Oh, I can't.
He'd try to see me again.
That's out of the question.
I don't understand.
What's wrong with Jake?
I think he's wonderful.
And you're miserable without him.
Well, that may be, but in some ways, in some very important ways, we're not compatible.
You mean he's not good enough?
- No, I don't.
- Blanche!
If we stayed together, our differences would turn us against each other.
I care too much to allow that.
You're lucky you have a choice.
My marriage was arranged.
- You didn't pick Pop?
- He didn't pick me, either.
We learned to love each other, but it wasn't our idea.
There were eight unmarried girls and eight unmarried boys in the village.
- How did they match them up?
- Height.
If I hadn't stood on that rock, I'd have ended up with Luigi the pig-boy.
If I got another chance at Mr Right, I'd want somebody entirely different from Charlie.
But I thought you adored him.
I did.
I am.
We had a wonderful life together.
But I'd like somebody really wild.
Somebody impulsive, who'd sweep me off my feet.
He'd come in his convertible Porsche and whisk me to the airport.
We'd fly to his villa in France, where we'd blindfold the orchestra and dance until dawn.
Then we'd watch the sun come up over two steaming cups of cocoa.
Cocoa?
With little marshmallows.
Marshmallows?
Rose, you trollop.
Dorothy, what kind of guy would you like now?
Somebody to get old with.
- You can do that by yourself.
- I'm aware of that, Rose.
Stan didn't want to get old.
No, I'd like someone to sit on the porch with, hold hands, listen to the birds, watch the grass grow.
- Blanche, what man do you want?
- I don't know.
You certainly do your share of comparison shopping.
Come on, Blanche.
What are you looking for?
I don't know.
I just know it's not Jake.
But that won't discourage me from finding Mr Right.
And I won't compromise my standards, either.
I will look high and low, far and wide, and never lose heart, for I know one day my prince will come.
What was that supposed to mean?
I wasn't paying close attention, but I gathered she's gonna sleep with that little black guy, Prince.
Rose, Rose, can I speak to you?
Oh, sure, Dorothy.
Excuse me.
Rose, there is something very odd about that all-female jazz band.
- What?
- They're all men.
I just thought they were really ugly women.
- What do we do?
- Nothing.
They're great.
If we pretend nothing is wrong, maybe no-one will notice.
Hey, did you get a load of those queens on the bandstand?
- Keep your voice down.
- Why?
They know they're queens.
- I think we're a success.
- Congratulations, Blanche.
Much of the credit goes to the food - original yet familiar, piquant yet comforting.
Blanche tells me she worked very closely with the caterer.
Did she mention they were naked?
You'll have to excuse my mother.
She was a witness to the Hindenburg disaster.
Jake did a wonderful job.
Where is he?
Oh, probably out in the kitchen.
There he is, by the dessert table.
Oh, he looks great in his tux!
Hunter, would you be a dear and er get me another wine spritzer?
Will you do me a favor?
Keep Hunter occupied while I go after Jake.
What?
You said you never wanted to see him again.
I made a mistake.
A terrible, terrible mistake.
What could I have been thinking?
How could I let him go?
What difference does it make how he dresses or eats?
What matters is, he's the man I love.
Excuse me.
Erm Where's Blanche going?
Erm she went to powder her nose.
At the dessert table?
Er well, the powder sticks better if you put a thin layer of caramel first.
Hunter, you look skeptical.
Well, hello.
I didn't see you standing there.
Really?
I haven't been able to take my eyes off you.
You look great.
Jake, the reason I came over I wanted to tell you I made a mistake.
Our differences don't really matter.
Blanche, I admire you.
You're a very special woman.
But you didn't make a mistake.
You were right.
Blanche, I'm happy.
I like myself.
I want to share my life with somebody who's as comfortable with me as I am with them.
I don't want to wonder if I'm using the wrong fork.
I know.
You said our differences don't matter.
But they did before, and they will again.
Blanche, knowing you has been one of the best things that's happened to me in my whole life.
Remember that.
- Jake - Let me kiss you.
Goodbye.
Blanche, what happened?
Well, Jake said he thinks we have too many differences, so we're not getting back together.
Oh, Blanche, I'm so sorry.
I don't understand how I let this thing happen.
I'm so confused.
Honey, you think you're confused?
Take a look at our horn section.
Blanche, aren't you even going to try to sleep?
I'm too upset.
Oh, let's face it.
I'm not 16 anymore.
There's no line of beaux on the front porch waiting to walk me to town.
No more cotillions, no more sorority parties.
I just lost the best thing that's happened to me since I met George.
I'm just a stupid old fool, sitting up all night with a broken heart.
Blanche Devereaux, I cannot believe what I am hearing.
You are the prettiest, most vibrant, most exciting woman I know.
Men still line up for you.
Really?
Your dance card is going to be full for the rest of your life.
I don't know whether you meant that or not, Dorothy, but thank you.
Damn, I'm good.
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
A few more snacks like that, the only thing you'll fit into is a saddle.
I'm not going to eat it all at once.
There's an I Love Lucy marathon on tonight.
I'm setting up for 12 straight hours of classic TV.
I never liked it.
Every episode Lucy said the same thing.
"Ricky, why can't I be in the show"?
Why couldn't she be in the show?
She was a riot at home.
His show with the club stank.
What's entertaining about a Cuban beating a drum?
Rose, there's an I Love Lucy marathon on tonight.
- You wanna watch it with me?
- That sounds great.
Who's in it?
Who's in it?
Um Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz.
The Ricardos and Mertzes.
Don't tell me you never saw I Love Lucy.
No.
I never watched much TV until I moved in here.
Charlie and I never had a TV.
We talked about getting one, but he said it wasn't perfected yet.
It sounds like to me Charlie was a little on the cheap side.
I'll say.
Charlie was a wonderful man, but he could squeeze a nickel till the buffalo pooped.
I'll tell you, there's something to the power of suggestion.
Excuse me.
Dorothy, would you like to stay up and watch I Like Lucy?
I Love Lucy.
I haven't seen it yet, so I don't know how I'll feel.
I won't have time with my daughter coming tonight.
We're gonna be talking about the - Nothing.
- What's the nothing?
The nothing is a nothing.
If it were something, I'd call it something.
There are more important things to talk about.
Is that rumaki?
Dorothy, you're keeping a secret from us.
I tell you everything.
I told you a secret last night.
- You're not a natural blonde?
- I am a natural blonde.
Right, Rose.
You and Tina Turner.
Did Dorothy tell you she's gonna be a grandma?
Oh, Ma, that was a secret!
Oh, Dorothy, why didn't you tell us?
Because we're not 100%% sure.
I didn't talk to Kate.
Ma did.
She had something she wanted to tell us in person and then she had to throw up.
Call me Kreskin.
She and Dennis have been trying to have children.
Oh, Dorothy, this is so exciting.
But, honey, we're not sure yet.
-  - That's Kate.
I am so nervous all of a sudden.
I am also very excited.
I have dreamed about this moment all my life.
Oh, honey.
Darling.
Is it my imagination, or was that my ex-husband Stanley?
Dorothy, it's me, your ex-husband Stan.
Excuse me.
With that new toupee I thought you were Ted Danson.
I just got it today.
It hasn't had time to settle.
Oh, wow, is that rumaki?
- Why are you here?
- I just came to see Kate.
How did you know she was coming?
She left a message.
I was in Lauderdale.
Oh, of course, I forgot.
It's spring break.
- Do you know why she's coming?
- No, I don't.
- Look at Dorothy's nose grow.
- Oh, shut up.
The yutz has a right to know.
What should the yutz know?
Well, we're not sure, but we think that Kate may be pregnant.
Wow!
That's incredible.
That makes me A yutz.
Some things never change.
You're gonna be a granddaddy, Stanley.
Wow.
Isn't life a gas?
This is amazing.
Excuse me again.
I can't believe it.
I am going to be a grandfather.
Think about it.
Part of me will be passed on to that child.
- But we'll learn to love it.
-  - Oh, Kate, honey.
- Mom.
Oh.
- Hello, Princess.
- Daddy.
It's so good to see you again.
You look wonderful.
I guess you have some big news, huh?
Rose, we'll give them their privacy.
Oh, you don't have to go.
I can speak in front of you.
I knew it.
I knew it.
I just knew it.
Stanley, I'm so happy.
Dennis had an affair and I've left him.
Stan, take your damn hands off me!
I'll be honest, I never liked him.
I knew that worm was no good.
What kind of a man has so little respect for marriage that he can cheat on a wonderful woman and jump into bed with the first available bimbo?
But enough about you, Stanley.
Let's talk about Kate's problems.
We had no problems, Mom.
That's why this was all such a shock.
- Not even in bed?
- Oh, Stanley.
Hey, I'm just trying to help.
Most men cheat on their wives because what they have at home is less than satisfying.
Oh, really, Mr. 30 Seconds?
Mom, Dad.
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
We're both being very insensitive.
How are you feeling, kitten?
Fine, Grandma.
That's okay.
A brave front is the first step back.
Bertrand Russell said that.
Or was it Nipsey Russell?
They're both so witty.
You're right, Grandma.
I'm not fine.
He really hurt me.
I feel so alone.
Honey, you are not alone.
You have your family with you.
Your grandma, mother and father will see you through this.
Absolutely.
I have a business appointment tonight.
I'm gonna call now and cancel and be here for you.
I don't want you to do that.
I'm fine.
Alright.
But I'll only be gone an hour.
Less than half an hour if she doesn't want dinner.
Keep your chin up, princess.
Your chins too, Dorothy.
You know, I'm still a little confused.
Now, who exactly is Ricky?
Lucy's husband.
- I thought Desi was.
- Not on the show.
- Desi wasn't on the show?
- Desi played Ricky.
- Who did Lucy play?
- Lucy.
I know.
But who did she play?
- Lucy.
- Right.
But who did she play?
Lucy played Lucy.
Well, then, why didn't Desi play Desi?
He wasn't tall enough.
I have never seen Kate so upset.
I am a wreck.
I feel like this has happened to me.
Like I am the one who had my heart stomped on.
Thank you for all your support.
Oh, I'm sorry, Dorothy.
It's just that Lucy doesn't know that that's really Fred dressed up as a burglar.
I'm sorry.
I didn't realize this was more important.
Rose, Blanche, this is the part where my good friends are supposed to shut off the TV.
So shut off the TV or it's out the window.
Thank you.
I'm touched.
- How you holding up?
- I threatened to hurl the TV.
That should give you some indication.
Kate seems to be handling things pretty well.
That's tonight.
She's still in shock.
Oh, I remember when Stanley told me he was having an affair.
It was at least 24 hours before I cut the crotches out of all of his slacks.
You didn't.
I was teaching English Lit at the time.
Symbolism was my life.
I remember how I felt when I thought Charlie was cheating on me.
Charlie?
We'd been married for 18 years.
And up until then, everything had seemed so perfect.
Then one night it happened.
He came home, had dinner, walked upstairs and went to sleep.
I went in the bathroom and cried my eyes out.
Rose, I don't want to encourage long stories, but it seems in this story you left out the - The story.
- That's the word.
Well, Charlie went right to sleep.
We didn't, well you know And he'd promised?
No!
It's just that that was the first time it had happened in 18 years of married life.
Get out of here.
You mean to say that every night without fail for 18 years, you and Charlie Of course.
Right after dinner.
Well, no wonder you never heard of I Love Lucy.
Of course, as it turned out, I was just overreacting.
I mean, it was a freak, one-time thing.
By the next morning, everything was back to normal.
By morning?
You mean to tell me, that every morning?
Charlie said that's why we didn't have headaches and we both had really shiny hair.
Listen, Rose, no offense, but I find that story a little hard to believe.
You don't even like to talk about sex.
In my experience, people who talk about it don't do it very often.
- Coffee, anyone?
-  - That must be Stan.
- I'll get it.
Oh, Blanche.
Blanche, why do they do it?
Why do men do it and think they can get away with it?
Same reason a dog licks himself, Dorothy.
Because he can.
Where's Stan?
- It wasn't Stan at the door.
- Who was it?
Just stay calm.
Just relax and don't do anything you'll be sorry for.
- Dennis.
- Hello, Mother Dorothy.
I can't believe you'd show your face.
I think you should leave.
- Mother Dorothy - Do not call me that.
I hate it when you call me Mother Dorothy.
I feel I should be handing out rice on the streets of Calcutta.
- Where is Kate?
- She's not here.
- She said she was coming here.
- She left.
- Where did she go?
- To meet with Marlo Thomas.
They're going to drink white wine spritzers and figure out how to fry your wandering male behind.
Dennis.
- Kate, we have to talk.
- She has nothing to say.
Get out.
Mom, you don't have to speak for me.
- Dennis, get out.
- Kate, please.
You don't owe it to me and I'll go if you want.
I'm just asking to speak to you.
I wonder how he's going to talk his way out of this one.
No matter what he says, she'll see right though it.
Good for Kate.
That bum deserves everything he gets.
I'm glad he showed up.
She can get it over with.
You think she'll still see Marlo Thomas?
'Cause I'd sure like an autograph.
Oh  I can't stand it anymore.
I thought you said everybody loved Lucy.
She's talking about Kate and Dennis.
How long have they been in there?
Since Lucy went to Scotland.
That would make it over 30 years.
It's been an hour, but Kate had a lot to get off her chest.
You think he'd have the courtesy to say goodbye.
- He's coming back, Mom.
- What?
He's getting a suitcase out of the car.
We talked things over.
Everything's okay.
Okay?
Everything's okay?
- Come on, Rose.
- What about Lucy?
We'll watch it on the portable.
But that set's black-and-white.
Dennis explained everything.
Explained?
Explained what?
How he did it?
I explained that when you were 12.
I can live with his apology.
He's very sorry.
He'll never do it again.
I don't want to end my marriage over this.
I think you're making a mistake.
Mom, Dennis is my husband and if I forgive him, you should, too.
- Forgive him?
- Look, it's my marriage.
I never should have come here.
That was a big mistake.
We'll be out of here in the morning.
Ma.
Ma.
What's going on?
I'm sorry, but I have to talk to you.
Dennis told Kate he was sorry for what he did - and they've made up.
- Marvelous.
Get the hell out!
Dennis had an affair.
How could she forgive him?
Dorothy, please, let me go back to sleep.
I was dreaming I was being held captive on a desert island by Cesar Romero in a loincloth.
Ma, Kate and I had a fight.
I have to talk to you.
You know that washcloth in my bathroom?
That's how big Cesar's loincloth was.
Good night.
Ma.
- Ma!
- Alright.
What did you and Kate have a fight about?
About advertising condoms on TV.
About Dennis.
I can't believe she would go back to him.
I told her it was a big mistake.
Who's asking you?
It's none of your business.
Kate came to me.
She came to you to listen.
You should stay out of it.
I don't know what to do.
Alright, alright.
Sit.
Listen.
Learn.
Picture this.
Brooklyn, July, 1949.
Ma, put a sentence together.
You sound like a sportscaster.
Oh, shut up.
Anyway, it was the night of your first anniversary.
You showed up at my house at two in the morning, crying.
You looked like hell.
You told me you had cooked an anniversary dinner for Stan.
He came home late and there was lipstick on his shirt.
You kept saying to me, "Ma, what should I do"?
- Remember what I told you?
- Yeah.
Thank God.
What was it?
I forgot.
You said that if you could erase this one day, is this still the man you want to be with?
And you said yes.
I thought to myself, "Idiot", but I kept my mouth shut.
I knew this was a decision you had to make.
You're saying I should stay out of this mess between Kate and Dennis.
I said it, used it in a story.
You want me to embroider it on your underwear?
Stay out of it!
I don't know if I can do that.
Then you're gonna lose Kate.
And someday Stan is gonna call you up and tell you you have a grandchild who you're never gonna see.
Good night, Ma.
Not tonight, Cesar.
I'm not in the mood anymore.
That last episode of I Love Lucy was hilarious.
It sure was.
I never realized you could have that much fun staying up all night.
Oh?
Not even with Charlie?
Oh, we never stayed up all night.
Just seven till midnight and five to seven every morning.
And, of course, till noon on Sundays.
Lord, no wonder you still mourn that man.
- Morning.
- Hi.
How are you doing?
Much better.
Ma and I talked and I know what I want to do.
For once you'll keep your mouth shut.
If I want things to be okay, I must get it off my chest.
Fine.
You'll feel better, but you'll lose your daughter.
- Morning, everyone.
- How did you get in?
The key under the mat.
- Do I smell waffles?
- No.
Could I smell waffles?
What does this look like?
The House of Pancakes?
- So, how's Kate doing?
- Better than I am.
Dennis is here and she's forgiven him.
He's here?
Somebody hold my hair.
I'm gonna kill him!
Oh, sit down and shut up.
Good morning, everybody.
Hi, Daddy.
Listen, I hear that you and Dennis are back together.
That's right.
We're leaving for the airport now.
- Kate, I want to say something.
- Yeah?
Not to you, to Dennis.
Dennis, I want to speak with you.
Mother.
It's alright, Kate.
Is your name Dennis?
I have a right to be there.
One sperm with a sense of direction and I pay for it for the rest of my life.
- Dorothy, I - Please, Dennis.
I just want you to listen.
Yesterday, Kate came to me, crying.
She was more hurt than I had ever seen her before.
- Dorothy - Please.
I want you to understand what that does to a parent.
Seeing your child hurt is worse than any pain you can possibly feel yourself.
When they're little, you protect them from the bullies on the playground, and then later you suffer with them through acne and puppy love.
Then the first date, then the first time alone in a car.
Finally they meet someone who will love them and take care of them and they don't need you.
You're not thrilled, but you get used to it.
And then something happens and you find out there's still bullies on the playground.
And the old instincts come back.
That's what happened yesterday.
I know you have made up, but I still have the same feelings.
Do you understand?
Yes, I do.
I did a very stupid thing that can't be undone.
I'm going to do everything to make it up to Kate.
I love her.
I promise you that nothing like this will happen again.
Good.
Good.
Because if it does, I will break every bone in your hand.
You'll spend your life selling newspapers out of a wagon.
Keep it zipped, buddy.
She's not kidding.
Dennis, is everything okay?
Everything is fine.
You'd better hurry.
You'll miss your plane.
Thanks, Mom.
Thanks, Dad.
If you're not doing anything around Memorial Day, visit us.
- How about me?
- Of course, Dennis.
Of course.
You're always included.
Dorothy, you're hurting me.
- Goodbye again.
- Bye, darling.
Oh, Dorothy, I'm so glad things worked out.
- Me too.
- Maybe you're not a grandmomma, but you're still a darned good momma.
Kate's gonna be a darned good momma too sometime.
How do you know?
'Cause it runs in the family.
Well, I guess I'll be going, too.
You know, Dorothy, out on the lanai out there, it was like old times.
You and me, a team, united.
Partners.
It felt pretty good, didn't it?
It sure did.
Where did it go wrong, Dorothy?
Oh Who knows?
These things happen.
I remember.
I wasn't happy at home under the sheets.
Dorothy, you're hurting me.
I mean it.
You're really hurting me.
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
- Can I offer you more coffee?
- No, thanks.
Rod, we better go - before we outstay our welcome.
- Too late.
We certainly enjoyed having you.
- Yeah, right.
- Welcome to the neighborhood.
Bye.
Good night already.
Ma, I cannot believe you, rushing them out of the house!
Rushing?
They took forever.
Two hours to eat pasta and salad?
Your father could eat dinner, read the paper, make love and have a pedicure in an hour.
And without getting up from the kitchen table.
- I think they were delightful.
- I did too.
So did I. I just love to welcome people to the neighborhood.
In fact, back home, I used to run our town's VÃ¤lkomm Wagon.
Oh, boy, was that fun!
Whenever a new family would move in to St. Olaf, we'd hop on the tractor and go to the neighbors' farm, carrying vats of smoked fish and big pitchers of freshly-squeezed potato juice.
While Cousin Dat played "Getting To Know You" through the hole in his windpipe.
Tell me, did you ever accompany him through the hole in your head?
Sophia, would you mind getting that, please?
No problem.
I'll drag my bad leg over to the door.
Ma'am, you shouldn't open the door - without asking who it is.
- Fine.
- Who is it?
- Detective Mullins, Miami PD.
Please, come in.
Please excuse my mother.
She's a little upset.
She just found out she has the same hairdresser as Whoopi Goldberg.
This is my associate, Bobby Hopkins.
Detective Mullins, I am Blanche Devereaux.
These are my roommates, Dorothy and Rose.
They're innocent.
I am not.
No, Bobby, you don't have to write that last part.
That was just a come-on.
I'm sorry to take up your time at this hour, but I'd like to ask some questions.
I am single, I'm free Saturday night.
And I can arch my back until my head touches my heels.
If you don't mind, I'll write that down.
Won't you sit down?
I'd like to ask you about your neighbors, the McDowells.
- They're not who you think.
- You mean we invited the wrong people to dinner?
In a manner of speaking.
You see, your next-door neighbors are dealers in stolen gems.
- Those sweet people?
- I'm afraid so.
We think they'll be making a major move in the next 72 hours, so we'd like to set up shop here.
Well, of course.
You can both stay in my room.
Now, wait just a minute.
All right, you can have the boy.
They can't just move in here.
Let them do their work from a van, like real police on TV.
We'd like your cooperation, but you have every right to say no.
No.
Um, girls, I think we need to discuss this.
Gentlemen, if you'll just excuse us for a moment.
Ladies, I think we must do this.
It's our duty as Americans.
I don't know.
Two policemen living in our house?
What's there to be afraid of?
Once you strip away the gruff exterior, badge, gun and uniform You've got a naked policeman.
Exactly.
Blanche, this is serious.
If we can assist the police, we should.
Their job is hard enough.
I know.
My father was a policeman.
Wasn't your father a farmer?
On the weekdays.
Saturday and Sunday, he and the other farmers became volunteer policemen.
Of course, the only crime in St. Olaf was that more people didn't practice better oral hygiene.
Mostly they sat around the jailhouse and took pictures of each other behind the bars in goofy poses.
- I vote no.
- Well, I agree with Ma.
Why should we get involved in something that might be dangerous?
If it was dangerous, they wouldn't let us get involved.
Blanche has a point.
And if anything happens, we've got the police right here with us.
- Maybe you're right.
- OK, then, it's all settled.
They can stay.
Detective Mullins, we decided you all can stay, so welcome to our home.
Thank you.
We appreciate this very much.
We'll be back tomorrow to set up.
You won't have to change your lifestyles.
We just need a bedroom and bathroom.
We'll use the kitchen as base.
Fine.
We'll just cook in the fireplace and pee in the broom closet.
Al?
Al!
- Yeah?
- How do you like the pasta?
It's OK.
I'm not that crazy about Italian food.
Lucky for you you carry a gun.
Excuse me?
The last three days with you have really been fun.
Hi, Sophia.
Hi, Al.
You hear anything on the wiretap yet?
Save your breath.
He can't hear a word.
Really?
Yeah.
I've been entertaining myself all afternoon.
Watch.
Hey, you dumb Bacciagaloop.
Your face looks like the rear end of a donkey.
This kills me.
You try it.
No, I will not!
I don't think you should talk to him like that either.
He's practically your daughter's boyfriend.
What?
They hate each other.
They fight all the time.
Very passionate fights.
It has all the signs of a classic lovelhate relationship.
From the sparks of that conflict rise the flames of desire.
Flames that ignite in an uncontrollable frenzy of lust, passion and ecstasy.
I'm sorry.
Where was I?
Oh, I don't believe this.
- Hey, Dick Tracy - What's your problem now?
I said move this someplace else where it would not be in the way.
I said I'd try.
I tried.
Would you also try to remember to put down the toilet seat after you use it?
Sorry, that was me.
I was experimenting with something but it didn't work out.
Dorothy, he's only trying to do his job.
It can't be very pleasant for him either.
As far as stakeouts go, it's nice.
I thought you couldn't hear with those on.
I do that for Sophia.
She likes calling me names, so I let her.
She's really a sweet lady.
She just doesn't like to show it.
- Is that a family trait?
-  You won't believe what happened to me at the store.
I saw the McDowells.
Luckily, they didn't see me, so I followed them through the store and I wrote down everything they bought.
Why?
For evidence, silly!
Rose, they steal jewels, not Geno's pizza rolls.
Ladies, listen to me now.
I know it seems like we're in this together, but they're dangerous.
Leave the police work to us.
Ready for a break, Al?
Thanks.
I'll get some fresh air.
Won't the neighbors see you?
A gentleman visitor.
But it'd look better with one of you.
Come on, Dotty.
"Come on"?
If you want me to do you a favor, ask me.
OK, don't bite my head off!
- You're a real charmer!
- Who are you?
Lady Di?
Do me a favor and join the bomb squad.
Oh, God, I am crazy nuts about this guy!
Hi, Rose.
It's Martha McDowell, your new neighbor.
I was here for dinner, and yesterday you followed me - around the supermarket.
-  Oh, my God!
Why, Dorothy, look, it's, uh it's Mrs. McDowell.
- Why is everyone staring at me?
- Your handbag and shoes clash.
We're a very fashion-conscious neighborhood.
It's short notice, but would you like to come to dinner tomorrow?
Oh, hello.
We haven't met.
I'm Martha McDowell from next door.
Hi, Martha.
You've met my son Alfonso and my grandson Bobby.
They're here from New York on a fishing trip.
All they've caught is a cold.
Nice touch, but I work alone.
Listen, I've got to run.
You let me know about dinner tomorrow night.
Bye.
Well, thank you, Sophia.
That was quick thinking.
No big deal.
I mistake a lot of people for my grandson.
- She invited you to dinner?
- Yes.
- Al - Forget it.
It's too dangerous.
- We can break the case open.
- What are you talking about?
We need a bug in their house.
- Bobby, it's not their job.
- We've got zip on the phone.
They're too smart.
To get a warrant, we need a bug.
- I'll do it.
I'll be the plant.
- You are a plant.
Rose, honey, you don't do too well under pressure.
Remember the time in the coffee shop when you didn't have enough money?
You ran into the ladies' and tried to climb out through the skylight.
That doesn't happen anymore, since I switched to decaf.
I would volunteer, but I'd be too conspicuous.
It's a dinner party and I plan to show cleavage.
If anybody does it, it should be me.
- Why you?
- I am the best under pressure.
And she bears a striking resemblance to Barnaby Jones.
You've been tossing and turning all night.
- What's bothering you?
- Nothing, nothing.
Don't you break a commandment.
What commandment?
Thou shalt not toss and turn?
- No, thou shalt not lie.
- That's not a commandment.
Really?
That doesn't make any sense.
There's, "thou shalt not commit adultery," "thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife".
Two refer to hitting the sheets, and they couldn't fit in lying?
Does anybody think before they write this down?
You're not making sense.
I can't talk to you when you're half asleep.
Excuse me, it's 4am.
Why don't you get a hose and whack me around until I'm razor-sharp?
Ma, I have a problem.
I'm worried about tomorrow.
I don't know whether or not I should go on that mission.
Dorothy, for 50 years you've told me your problems.
Who should I take to the prom?
Should I marry Stan?
These were things I could help you with.
"Should I go on this mission"?
is not my area of expertise.
Who am I, Oliver North?
You're not making this any easier.
All right, if you think it'll help land this Al character, do it.
Al?
Who said anything about landing Al?
Do you think I'd risk my life for Al?
I'm doing this because I think it's right.
Because I'm a concerned citizen.
And I'd give my right arm to land Al!
I'm scared.
I don't know.
Your problem isn't unique.
People do crazy things for love all the time.
Let me tell you a story.
Picture this: Sicily, August 1908.
No, that's not it.
But if you ever need a story about jealousy, this is a pip.
- Ma, just go to sleep.
- No, I remember.
Havana, 1957.
No, I was never in Havana.
- Ma!
- I meant Brooklyn, 1958.
No, that's not it.
I don't believe it.
I'm dry!
I got nothing!
- It's OK, Ma.
- No, it's not.
Tommy Lasorda should be standing by the bed, waving to the bullpen.
Ma, don't let it bother you.
I just can't leave you hanging.
Would you settle for a very wise observation?
Yes.
Al's a good guy, and he makes you happy.
If you're doing it for that alone, it's worth it.
You're also doing it because you feel it's the right thing.
Thanks, Ma.
That means a lot to me.
Good.
Now, get some rest, pussycat.
Tomorrow could be your last day.
It's a shame we have to go to the McDowells' tonight.
- There's a great movie on TV.
- What?
In Cold Blood.
It's about This innocent family is brutally murdered - May I see that, Rose?
- Sure.
Thank you.
Rose, we're nervous enough about going over.
Do you have to make it worse?
Well, it's nothing to be nervous about.
Bobby and Al are watching through the window the whole time.
If we get in trouble, we just signal them.
How are we doing, ladies?
To be honest, we're a little nervous.
All right.
Let's go over the plan once more.
Check.
At 1800 hours, we enter the suspects' domicile.
At 1830 hours, we sit down to dinner.
After wine is poured at approximately 1840 hours, I begin telling the story about Uncle Hertis and the skunks, - which should last about - 1900 hours.
Dorothy, here's the transmitter.
Keep it in your hand.
Then, with one quick movement, stick it under the table.
That's it.
All right, so, any other questions?
Well, I guess that's it.
Good luck.
- Let's go.
- Ma, you're not going.
I am.
If anything goes wrong, - you need someone experienced.
- In what?
Life.
You're looking at a woman who lived through two wars, 15 vendettas, four operations and two Darrins on Bewitched.
I don't think those are very good reasons to go.
No?
How about this one?
I'm hungry.
Let's roll, Danno.
Al All right, that's the front door closing.
Yeah, the ladies are out of the house.
The transmitter's working perfectly.
Clear as a bell.
They did it.
I can't believe it.
I had doubts about this one.
- Congratulations.
Great job.
- Thank you.
- It's really working?
- Give her the phones.
I hate to say this, but it was almost fun.
Fun?
My pulse was racing, my heart was pounding!
I could barely get my breath!
That's the most fun I've ever had standing up!
No, I take it back.
There was that one time on that 74 7.
They keep talking about the noodle-head in the red dress.
Could that be code?
Only to the noodle-head in the red dress.
OK, what happens next?
We should get enough to get warrants and be out of your lives by tomorrow.
- I'm beat.
I'm going to bed.
- Me too.
Boy, I'm too excited to sleep!
- You're not.
You're beat too.
- Oh, yeah.
I'm beat too.
I'm so beat, I won't be able to hear a thing that goes on.
But I'd like to hear about it tomorrow.
Give me the earphones.
Get some rest.
OK, Al.
Hey, Dorothy, I just wanna say you did a nice job.
- Thanks, Al.
And Dorothy I also wanted to say it took guts.
- Thanks, Al.
You see, Dorothy, I just wanted to ask you I wanted to ask you  For God's sakes, he wants to ask you to go out with him!
You got your listening equipment, I got mine.
Good night.
-  - Come in.
Bobby, here's those extra towels you asked for, honey.
- Thanks, Blanche.
- You're welcome.
Blanche, thank you for everything you've done the past few days.
You don't have to thank me for anything.
Actually, I kind of enjoyed doing it.
You remind me a lot of my son, Matthew, except he doesn't carry a gun.
Bobby, does your momma know you carry that gun?
Blanche, I'm a grown man.
I don't need her permission.
Although, to be honest, she's not thrilled about it.
That's because she loves you.
I'd be a nervous wreck if Matthew were a police officer.
I worry about him enough, and he's a CPA.
I guess that's just a mother's nature.
Well, I'll see you in the morning.
Hey, Blanche, listen, uh My mom's in Oregon.
I don't get a home-cooked meal too often.
OK if I stop by sometime?
I think that would be great.
I don't care how old you think you are - it's light's out.
- Yes, ma'am.
- OK.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Bobby, let's go!
The exchange is going down!
Move it!
- What's going on?
- It's the McDowells.
Get on the floor and stay there!
Now!
- I'm scared!
- I'm scared too!
I'm scared for Al and Bobby.
- Shh!
What was that noise?
- That was me.
Thanks for calling it to everyone's attention.
Oh What's happening out there?
- Shut up.
I hear something.
- I don't.
-  - Gunshots!
Oh, sweet Jesus!
That could have been Al!
We have to do something.
We have to wait till he comes back.
What if he can't come back?
-  Thank God you're OK!
- Is everything OK?
Just stay down.
It's Mullins.
I need an ambulance at the stakeout.
My partner's shot.
Oh!
Yeah, at first I was really scared, but then I realized it was a shoulder wound and calmed down.
Actually, I passed out.
But I did it calmly.
- Bobby, you're so brave.
- You're so stupid!
You're supposed to duck a bullet.
In Sicily, you don't pass kindergarten till you learn that.
Really?
In St. Olaf, we just had to promise not to eat paste.
All right, ladies, let's not baby him.
- Al, how are you doing?
- Great.
The DA will put away the McDowells for a long time.
Gee, who's going to look after their lawn?
Rose, while we're here, maybe you should have a CAT scan.
Come on, Bobby, out of bed.
You've got to go out to the sun deck.
- Who wants to drive?
- I'll do it.
It's nice not to be a passenger for a change.
I want you to tell me the whole story from the beginning.
From the time that you left Dorothy I want to ask you something.
How about you and I go out sometime, huh?
Dorothy, I want to see you again.
- I want to see you again too.
- Great.
- But I can't.
- Why not?
Because I could get serious about you.
- I don't get it.
- Al, until the other night, I thought this whole thing was a game, but after what happened, I realized it isn't.
You don't want to become involved with someone who could get hurt.
I'm sorry, Al.
It's not the first time I've heard it.
I understand.
Thanks.
You take good care of yourself, you hear?
Yeah.
- So, are you two an item?
- No.
No, we decided it was best - if we didn't see each other.
- Are you sure, Dorothy?
- In your heart, are you sure?
- Yes, Ma.
Fine, then I want you to meet someone.
Dr. Tansy This is my daughter.
And this guy is nobody.
Beat it, Al.
{END OF EPISODE 24}{START OF EPISODE 25}
I got the ice.
Haven't you finished the hors d'oeuvres yet?
- I'm doing the celery sticks.
-  Did you finish the decorations?
No, not yet.
I kinda got sidetracked.
Look!
This is what you've been doing for 45 minutes?
Uh-huh.
Isn't he cute?
I call him Scotty.
Now you can call him garbage.
Help Blanche with the hors d'oeuvres.
What time's the birthday girl getting here?
Roberta will be here at two.
- Does she suspect anything?
- Please!
The woman is 88.
She still tries to find Gunsmoke on Sunday nights.
Dorothy, get the cake and we'll take these in.
Good idea.
Wait, where's the cake?
- Rose, did you take it?
- I haven't even seen it yet.
- Ma, where's the cake?
- I haven't seen it yet, either.
What do you mean?
You were supposed to bake it!
I was?
- Oh, Ma!
You forgot!
- I didn't forget.
I wanted it to be fresh.
I'll bake it now.
Roberta will be here in 45 minutes.
You don't have time.
and knit you a sweater!
Out of my way.
The maestro approaches the podium.
Gee, I hope Sophia finishes in time.
You can't give a good birthday party without a cake.
I recall a party with three cakes that was not so terrific.
Three?
Rose had planned a surprise birthday party for me.
You were still living at Shady Pines.
You mean the home.
Say it, Dorothy.
The home.
Anyway, Rose had planned this surprise birthday party for me.
I'll never forget it.
I've never had such a surprise in my life.
?
Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you ?
Happy birthday boys and girls ?
Happy birthday to you ?
Welcome to Mr. Ha Ha's Hot Dog Hacienda!
I have lots of fun planned for you.
But finish your Mr. Ha Ha dog first because ?
A Ha Ha dog is fun to eat ?
A Ha Ha dog is really neat ?
A Ha Ha dog is a great big treat ?
And it's only $ 1.79 without a beverage ?
Wooh!
See you soon, kids!
Isn't this fun?
Dorothy, you haven't even touched your Mr. Ha Ha dog.
- You're right.
-  There, I touched it.
You're not having any fun, are you, Dorothy?
Am I that transparent?
You're the one who always complains that her birthday parties are boring.
When I saw Mr. Ha Ha's on TV, it looked like fun.
For a five-year-old, Rose.
Or someone who thinks like one!
- I've ruined your birthday.
- Oh, no, you haven't.
- You haven't ruined it.
- Yes, I have.
I'm a big dope.
You must hate me.
Oh, honey, come on now, don't cry.
Rose, I don't hate you!
I'm really having fun.
It's just that it took me a little while to get into the spirit of things.
- Seriously?
- Oh, yes.
Both Blanche and I are having a lot of fun.
Aren't we, Blanche?
Who wouldn't have fun eating a foot-Iong Mr. Ha Ha dog?
And drinking a 32-ounce Cherry Burpy.
If you drink three, you get to keep Mr. Ha Ha's hat.
If you drink three, you should get to keep Mr. Ha Ha's kidney!
Guess who's back?
Mr. Ha Ha!
That's right!
Now it's time for the Mr. Ha Ha birthday roundup!
When I call your name, please come up on stage.
Bobby Spina!
Please say you didn't do this, Rose.
-  Jeannie Taylor!
- Please tell me you didn't.
Dorothy Zbornak!
- Dorothy Zbornak!
- Stop that!
You're making a fool of yourself.
Mr. Ha Ha's looking at you.
- Are you Dorothy Zbornak?
- That's right.
- Get up on stage, Dorothy!
- Get bent, Ha Ha!
Come on, kids.
Let's give Dorothy a great big Ha Ha cheer!
- Ha Ha!
-   Dorothy!
Dorothy!
Dorothy!
Dorothy!
Dorothy!
Dorothy!
Dorothy!
Dorothy!
Dorothy!
Dorothy!
Dorothy!
Dorothy!
Dorothy!
Dorothy!
It says here on my Ha Ha birthday list that Bobby is seven Jeannie is nine, and Dorothy is I'll punch your heart out, Ha Ha.
Dorothy is the oldest!
And, as the oldest, you get to lead the birthday parade!
Here is your parade leader's hat.
Mr. Music, if you please.
Don't prolong this.
I know what car you drive.
The parade's over!
Let's hear it for all the birthday boys and girls!
But the fun's just about to begin.
Because it's time for your Ha Ha hot fudge cake!
Free to all my birthday boys and girls.
Only $1.98 to the rest of you.
No, thank you.
I've had enough.
Oh!
I think we have a cranky birthday girl!
You see, kids, when you get a little older, you can get a little cranky.
And when you get as old as Dorothy, you can be a real pain in the Ha Ha.
So, Dorothy, lighten up, enjoy your cake and make a wish, OK?
Come on, kids.
Make a wish and blow out the candles.
I hope everybody gets what they wished for.
Do you really, Mr. Ha Ha?
Dorothy, if I were you, I'd put the cake down.
You see, Mr. Music's brother is Mr. Lawyer.
Besides, that's not a very adult thing to do.
You're right.
I can't do it.
- Mr. Ha Ha?
- Yes, Bobby?
Happy birthday, Dorothy.
I'm sorry I missed that one, but I was At the home.
We know, Ma.
How's the cake coming, Sophia?
Beautiful.
I got everything.
Coconut, eggs, unbleached flour, rum.
- Oh, you making a rum cake?
- No.
Gee, I love to bake.
In St. Olaf, I baked our birthday cakes.
Charlie loved 'em.
I remember the last cake I baked in St. Olaf.
It was kinda different.
Oh, my birthday!
I completely forgot!
Well!
I'd better make a wish and blow out those candles before Mr. Hickenlooper has the volunteer fire brigade up here pumping water on my clean kitchen floor.
I swear, that man will look for any excuse to make that siren sound through his nose.
Inga Lundqvist told me just this last week I know.
Shut up, Rose, and blow out your candles.
OK.
A wish.
I guess that was kind of a silly wish.
I know you can't really be here with me, Charlie.
It's taken me these past eight months to accept that, but I finally have.
Then why our usual little private birthday celebration?
It somehow feels less Ionely, Charlie.
I mean, this is the first special day I've had to spend without you.
If it had been Christmas, I'd have hung your stocking.
Or if it had been your birthday, I probably would have still asked the clerk down at Tuttles to help me pick out a tie for you.
I bet that would have gotten me some strange looks from the sales staff.
Although they already look at me strangely.
Because of the time I tried to special-order a double-breasted suit with a drop-seat in the pants for cousin Wendell.
Anyway, that was part of the reason.
The other part was I wanted to talk to you.
I know.
I didn't need a special occasion for that.
It would be more of an occasion if I stopped talking.
But I I figured since it was my birthday, you wouldn't be upset when you hear what I've got to tell you.
I've decided to sell the house and leave St. Olaf, Charlie.
The winters are rough here in Minnesota.
And this place is too filled with memories to let me get on with my life.
I need to start over without you, Charlie.
And I think this is the best way.
I know it'll be tough in a strange town all alone.
But I've read some wonderful things about Miami.
It won't be long before I meet nice people and make some new friends.
I have a real good feeling about that.
So I just wanted you to know what I decided.
I hope to be in Florida before the next winter comes.
But I know that wherever I am, you'll be right there with me.
I love you, Charlie.
I miss you.
It's my birthday!
You know the rules.
I get the rose.
and a pinch of baking soda.
Ma, that looked like an awfully big pinch.
Who cares?
Sophia, maybe you should sit down.
I am sitting.
You know, I'm gonna make you a nice pot of coffee.
Don't panic, I'm fine.
I haven't had that much.
Besides, you think I'd ruin Roberta's milestone birthday?
- Milestone?
She's 88.
- Right.
After 80, every year without a headstone is a milestone.
I think my milestone birthday was when I turned 50.
Oh, Ma, I remember your 50th.
We were meant to go to a party at Guido's, but you fought with Pop.
I'll never forget it.
It was Brooklyn, April, 1956.
Dorothy, I tell the stories around here.
Picture it: Brooklyn, April, 1956  Fine!
If that's the way you feel!
Sophia, I'm staying right here!
Fine!
Stay there forever, you big Bacciagaloop!
- I curse the day I met you!
-  Doubled!
Ma, it's me, Dorothy!
- Happy birthday, Ma.
- Ah, shut up!
You're welcome.
You'll be late for your birthday party.
Stan's in the car.
- I'm not going.
- What do you mean?
What do I have to celebrate?
A miserable marriage and leaving my husband?
- You had a fight.
- You love to show off that college education, don't you?
OK, why are you mad at Pop?
Because your father is a miserable, no-good, insensitive bum!
-  I heard that!
- Good, then hear this!
May you lose the three hairs left on your head!
Oh, yeah?
May you lose your tweezers so your eyebrows meet to cover the wart on your forehead!
That's not a wart, that's a beauty mark!
On Sophia Loren, it's a beauty mark!
On you and Khrushchev, it's a wart!
Pop, enough!
Come out of the bedroom now!
Not while she's there.
She hit me.
- Ma!
- With a piece of bread.
Five days old!
Like a jack handle!
He deserved it for how he wished me a happy 50th.
What are you talking about?
You're 48.
That's what I thought.
But last night, during Your Show Of Shows, he hands me papers he found.
He says they made a mistake on my birth certificate when I came into this country and I'm actually 50!
So what's the difference?
You're 50.
What's the difference?
I gave him the best years of my life and he just stole two more!
I've never been so depressed.
Oh, Ma, it doesn't mean anything.
You don't understand, Dorothy.
I always had plans, dreams, things I wanted to accomplish by the time I was 50.
- What kind of dreams?
- Well for one thing, I always wanted to be a ballerina.
Please!
With those legs?
Come on out, Salvadore, I've got more bread waiting for you!
I've got news for you.
It wouldn't have been easier to break into ballet at 48.
But I'd still have two more years to dream.
I can't believe it.
I'm 50!
I'm an old lady who hasn't accomplished a thing in life.
You haven't accomplished a thing?
You raised three kids during the Depression and always managed to have food on the table.
You had two jobs as far back as I can remember, but were always there when we needed you.
You got me through college, by helping pay for it, and by encouraging me when I felt like giving up.
Do you want me to go on, Ma?
We could be here all night.
Enough.
Ralph Edwards makes less of a fuss over people.
I'm tired of this old lady business!
You're acting like an ass!
You don't look 50.
You don't look 48.
You're as beautiful as the day I married you.
Oh, Salvadore!
Tell me that again.
You're acting like an ass!
He's right.
Salvadore, open the door.
We have a birthday party to go to.
Ma!
Pop, come on.
You'll be late for the party.
Er we'll be there in about an hour, Dorothy.
Oh, Salvadore!
Dorothy!
Er make that two hours!
Wow.
Happy birthday, Ma.
Actually, we never got to the party at all.
There were a lot of disappointed people.
I wasn't one of them.
Neither was your father, if memory serves me correctly.
Is this cake ready?
Roberta's gonna be here any minute.
It's ready when it's ready.
Oh, well, she won't be surprised anyway.
Surprise birthday parties never work.
Yeah?
What about the surprise party we threw for you when we first moved in?
That worked.
Almost.
I mean, it kind of worked.
Hi, Rose, I picked up Blanche's birthday cake.
- What are you doing?
- Decorating Blanche's cake.
There, it's finished.
I said I would get the cake!
I know, but where I come from, most people won't eat store-bought.
Rose, where you come from, most people live in windmills and make love to polka music.
Stop it, Dorothy, you're making me homesick.
We're coming!
Who could that be?
Everybody I invited is already here.
-  Sophia!
- Ma!
What are you doing here?
You shouldn't leave the home.
You're recovering from a stroke!
What recovering?
I'm back 100%%, knock wood.
Come in!
Just listen.
We are throwing a surprise birthday party for Blanche.
Go out to the lanai - and mingle with the guests.
- Check.
- What's a lanai?
- The porch!
Excuse me, Krystle Carrington!
Blanche is gonna be surprised!
It's lucky I found out today's her birthday.
- Blanche, what's wrong?
- Nothing.
I want to take a bath and forget about today.
- Oh, OK.
- No!
Girls, we haven't lived together very long, but when I come home mad and say nothing's wrong, you have to draw what's wrong out of me.
Blanche, what's wrong?
Nothing.
OK.
Oh, all right, quit badgering me!
I didn't want to tell you this, but today's my birthday.
Today's your birthday, Blanche?
Today?
Dorothy, did you hear that?
Today is Blanche's birthday!
- And I hate birthdays.
- And she hates birthdays.
The only thing worse is surprise parties.
What did I get at work today?
A surprise birthday party.
Oh, I was so upset I almost threw up.
Did you hear that, Dorothy?
Surprise parties make Blanche want to throw up.
Honey, go and take that bath.
We'll just forget the fact that today is really your birthday.
Well, I don't see how anybody can hate birthdays.
Well, because they are constant reminders that with each year our bodies begin to sag, our faces begin to wrinkle, our hair begins to turn gray.
Of course, none of that's happened to me yet.
But it's only a question of time until I look like you two.
Blanche, keep that up, you won't have that much time left.
Hi, Blanche.
I'm here for your surprise birthday party.
My what?
What?
You didn't.
Of course we didn't.
Ma, there's no party.
- Maybe I should take you home.
- Am I Frances Farmer?
I know there's a party out there!
Blanche, I guess we made a mistake.
Look, we'll cancel the party.
We'll forget that the whole thing ever happened.
Whoa, everybody!
The party's off!
They want us out!
But you're welcome to come back to my place.
If someone can tell me where it is.
Roger!
Edgar!
Burt!
Leland!
Well, what are they all doing here?
I invited everybody in your address book.
The little red one by my night stand?
No, the little black one next to your hot body oil dispenser.
Wait a minute, fellas.
No need to rush off like this.
It is my birthday.
Who wants to be the first one to spank me?
Boy, that turned out to be some evening, didn't it?
It sure did.
From that night on, I learned to love surprise parties.
It reminded me of a party in St. Olaf, as a little girl.
Big Sven and Little Sven were celebrating the first anniversary of their smoked herring hoagie house, when Big Sven -  -  I'll get it!
It's my cake.
I'll get it.
Ma, that looks like a cookie.
You put too much rum in it.
Stick an umbrella in it and serve it with straws.
Everyone will think they're at Trader Vic's.
Let's take it in.
Roberta will be here any minute.
I hope she's surprised.
The best part of a birthday is being surprised.
Surprise!
What?
- Happy birthday, Blanche.
- But but my birthday's not till next week.
We know.
But you said last time we'd never be able to surprise you again.
- It was the only way to do it.
- You did a great job.
- I don't know what to say.
- Say it's conga time!
{END OF EPISODE 25}{START OF EPISODE 26}
Sophia.
I wish Mr. Fix-It would finish fixing that dishwasher.
The dishes are piling up like crazy.
Blanche, we could wash them.
Before dishwashers, people didn't just eat and wipe the dishes on their pants.
I used to love washing dishes.
In Minnesota, the whole family would get together and wash dishes.
Even Uncle Gustaf, after the giant Swiss army knife accident, learned to dry dishes with his feet.
We used to laugh and have such a happy time.
What is it with you?
You only had happy times?
It's sickening.
Happy times freezing in the cold, happy times during a locust invasion, happy times eating reindeer.
Death?
Did you have happy times then?
Well, yes, actually, we did.
We could get together and remember other happy times.
She's beginning to get to me.
Ma.
In Sicily, we washed our dishes in the river.
-  - I hope that's Mr. Fix-It.
We used to beat them against the rocks.
No, Sophia.
You beat the clothes on the rocks, not the dishes.
No wonder they broke.
Okay, who wants to go shopping?
It's early for that, Renee.
Then we'll eat.
Shopping or eating.
Take your pick.
- You didn't talk to him.
- I couldn't.
George was on call all weekend.
Three heart attacks, a stroke, two aneurysms and a spastic colon.
Sounds like a guy I play checkers with.
- Hi, Renee.
- Hi, Rose.
- You'll talk to him tonight?
- I will try.
Renee.
It's crazy, but how can I bother him?
He's doing all this important stuff.
Saving lives.
I'm gonna bother him because I'm unhappy?
Renee, Jenny just left for college.
All your kids are gone.
This is a perfectly legitimate problem.
Empty-nest syndrome.
When I had it, I didn't know it.
I was depressed.
When I figured it out, I was gonna tell Charlie, but he died that night.
I was so full of grief, I forgot to be depressed about the empty nest.
I never had that empty-nest depression.
I couldn't wait for my kids to go.
I got depressed watching them grow older 'cause it meant I was older.
They were like noisy little calendars.
The minute they entered high school, I told everybody they were my husband's from a previous marriage.
And you wonder why they're in therapy.
Maybe I should go into therapy.
At 2am, waiting for George to come home, I called a radio talk show with a solution to the Middle East crisis.
Giving the Palestinians Greenland?
You heard it?
I didn't know that was you.
You were great.
Giving the Palestinians Greenland?
It's a big place.
Nobody uses it.
You'd take desert people and put them in ice and snow?
With the proper clothes, they'll be fine.
Renee, listen, you wanna talk, don't call a talk show.
Talk to your husband.
Blanche, at the hospital they call him St. George.
I'm married to a saint and I tell him to work less, I'm Ionely?
Don't you think St. Francis of Assisi's wife had a similar problem?
Don't you think she said, "Frank, enough donkeys"?
So what, I ask George to cut back on his practice?
Don't do that.
- I can't go to another doctor.
- See?
George is the only man to ever see me naked.
Get outta here.
Well, except for Charlie, of course.
- Get outta here.
- And the vet.
The vet?
Our prize hen, Henrietta, had some kind of a chicken disease or something.
I don't exactly know what it was.
Chickenpox.
No, I don't think so.
I had an earache, so he saw us both at the same time.
- For that you got naked?
- I thought it was strange, too.
You know, Dorothy, you're right.
I've got to talk to George.
- Good girl.
- I'll go home and tell him.
I'll cook breakfast for him.
He loves waffles.
No, I'll tell him at dinner.
Dinner's better.
He won't be rushing.
I'll make something great.
I'll tell him in bed.
- Bed's better.
- It always works.
Asleep.
I'll tell him when he's sleeping.
Renee!
I sound like a wimp.
I can't possibly tell him.
If I can talk about my stool sample, you can say you're Ionely.
Leonard, help me out here.
Where on that diet I gave you does it say creamed chipped beef and Polish sausage are okay to eat?
Leonard, you're 5'6", you weigh 300Ibs.
What do you mean you can carry it?
Bekins couldn't carry it.
Make an appointment for tomorrow.
We'll talk about it.
Right.
-  - Goodbye, Leonard.
Chuck.
I'm a multiple personality.
How do you know which of me I am?
Because Mr. Fix-It and Boris use a key.
Ah.
We all live in one body.
Why don't they let me use the key?
Isn't there medication at the home?
No, doctor says I don't need it anymore.
It doesn't stop the personalities.
It just relieves anxiety.
I'm not anxious.
I make other people anxious.
- Hi, Chuckie.
- Hi, sis.
- You're over here early.
- I'm looking for an apartment.
Doctor says I can get my own place.
- Oh!
- Who can afford three bedrooms?
Can I go upstairs and see the dog?
Sure.
Go ahead.
Renee, we don't have a dog.
If he thinks we do, who am I to stop him?
Maybe we have one.
Maybe he sees things we don't have the power to see.
I read that.
People with mental illnesses are the chosen.
Who chooses them - Shirley MacLaine?
- George, we gotta have a talk.
- Okay.
- We have marital problems.
-  Excuse me, honey.
Hello?
Yeah.
Hello, Mr. Schecter.
Oh, that is good news.
Great news.
I'm very happy for you.
Congratulations.
Goodbye, Mr. Schecter.
Mr. Schecter peed.
Oh.
He's 97.
We're both very relieved.
- A catheter's no fun.
- So, what do you think?
I'd be thrilled to pee at his age.
-  - What about our marriage?
- I'm worried about us.
- What?
We're great.
I don't think we're great.
- Hi, Rose, Sophia.
- Hi.
Come on in.
Sit down.
We're sorry to barge in.
Is Mr. Fix-It here?
- Chuck is here.
-  Oh, darn.
Could he change into Mr. Fix-It?
It's a mental illness, Rose, not a masquerade party.
A guy in Sicily had a multiple personality.
They didn't get along.
One personality put out a contract on the other.
He had a shoot-out with himself in the piazza.
He winged a priest, a waiter and shot down the Cinzano sign.
He was able to beat himself senseless before anyone else got hurt.
I rewired your phone.
You can call all over the world for free.
Except for Albania and North Korea.
And you can use your TV remote to flush the toilet.
I'm going to the freeway, see if any cars need help.
This guy knocks me out.
Chuck, could you finish our dishwasher first?
I'm not Chuck, I'm Mr. Fix-It.
Here to please.
No problem too big or too small.
This is great.
It's better than vaudeville.
I'm all ears, ladies.
Lead me to the trouble.
There's nothing I can't fix.
Except this noggin.
That could use rewiring.
- Let's go.
- Come on, Sophia.
We don't want to lose him.
- I'd better get to the office.
- We're not done.
- Couldn't it wait?
- No, it cannot wait.
The kids are gone, you're never here.
I have nothing to do anymore.
- What do your friends do?
- Shop, lunch.
Some play golf, some have affairs.
- Which ones are having affairs?
- I don't know.
Come on, I'll never tell.
The ones who are happy for no reason.
- George, my life is empty.
- Why don't you get a job?
I thought of that.
I could go back to show business.
Renee, you were the legs in the dancing cigarette box.
Everybody loved me.
I brought joy to people.
You sold cigarettes.
You brought cancer to people.
No matter what you think, I'll try to get work in the entertainment business.
But that's just my part.
You've got a part, too.
- You've got to be here more.
- You never complained before.
The kids were here.
I didn't notice.
But, George, time is important now.
With them gone, we're supposed to be together in a new way.
It was on a coffee commercial.
I think Taster's Choice.
This couple - we're supposed to be like that.
- Like what?
- Like this couple.
They're there, just the two of them, sipping coffee together, for as long as they have left.
Must be one hell of a cup of coffee.
I'm in real trouble here, George.
- Our marriage is in trouble.
-  Excuse me, honey.
Hello.
Yeah.
Describe the pain.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Okay, meet in my office.
Yes, right now.
- I gotta go.
-  I got a sick person.
See you later.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Come on, a movie will cheer you up.
- What are you seeing?
- Nightmare On Elm Street 4.
Do you have to see the others?
No, Rose, it stands alone.
- Hi, everybody.
- Jenny!
Jenny, what are you doing home from school?
- You're sick?
You're pregnant?
- I quit.
- Thank God.
- I thought you'd be mad.
I am.
I'm also glad you're not pregnant.
Honey, why did you quit?
I went to be with my boyfriend, but he was practically living with somebody else.
- He'd replaced me.
- With what?
A hand puppet, Rose.
Honey, I am so sorry.
You shouldn't have gone to Columbia University.
It's in New York City, for heaven's sake.
A subway runs right through it.
You want to go where there are green lawns and willow trees and young men in chinos and ties and professors with just a touch of gray at the temple.
Wise, learned men who look up your skirt if you're in the first row.
Meetings with them so they can explain Plato.
And they lean over your books with you and you can smell their pipe tobacco and their maleness.
Then their arm accidentally brushes against your bosoms and the room is filled with the heat of a taboo lust.
Where is this school?
Jenny, what happened?
- He met a thin, blonde goddess.
- Uh-huh.
One of those girls who has everything, you know.
Looks, money, brains, a body, and now my boyfriend.
Honey, I've been in that position more than once.
You've been in every position more than once.
- My position?
- Oh, goodness, no.
The goddess' position.
We have our problems, too.
Especially when the goddess is now twice the size.
Honey, I know what you're feeling.
Everyone's been rejected.
And, honey, the loss of your first love is the worst, the very worst.
I know.
I remember mine.
It was probably a cow.
How on earth did you know that, Sophia?
Wild guess.
Mine was Larry Raganetti.
Oh, how I loved him.
He was gorgeous.
He left me for Cookie Kelly.
She kissed with her mouth open.
Why not kiss with your mouth open?
I was eight.
So?
It's happened to all of us, sweetheart.
We've all survived.
- Never happened to me.
- Oh, come on.
You were never rejected?
- Well, once.
But just once.
- By who?
Weight Watchers for being too thin.
Come on, girls.
- Thanks for coming over.
- Bye, honey.
- Hi, George.
- Hello.
- Bye, George.
- Hi, George.
- Sophia.
- Hi, George.
Bye, George.
Hi, honey.
Sweetheart!
Oh!
- What are you doing home?
- She's not sick or pregnant.
- Is it Thanksgiving already?
- Dennis dumped me.
Oh.
Sugar, I'm so sorry.
I wish I could say something to make you feel better.
- What if I said I hated him?
- Oh, Daddy.
I know how much it hurts, darling.
But you know, I've been rejected many times.
So has your daddy.
I can't go back.
I can't.
I just can't.
What if I run into them?
I'll die of embarrassment.
No, you won't.
I'm a doctor and I've never seen anyone die of embarrassment.
If it'll make it easier, I'll go with you and help get you settled.
- Will you?
- Absolutely.
- Hi, everybody.
- Hi, Oliver.
You wanna know who I spent the night with?
- No, Oliver.
- The cabin crew of Lufthansa.
- I have to go?
- You're 18.
You don't have to.
We won't force you.
We'll cut you off without a dime and never talk to you again.
- So you strongly recommend.
- Yes.
Okay.
- I owe you a beer.
- I'll make some calls - and see some friends.
- Where are you going?
- Back to school.
- Flying?
- Yeah.
- You'd be safer hitching.
- Oliver, don't start.
- I'm a test pilot.
- I know what goes on.
- I don't need to hear this.
Or what goes on in the cockpit.
- Hey, come on.
- Goodbye, Oliver.
- Bye, Jen.
- Poor kid.
- But we did the right thing.
- Absolutely.
- You really think so?
- I don't know.
George, would you take a look at this?
This is a family discussion, Oliver.
Hey, that's nice.
I wish I had a family.
- I think it's skin cancer.
- It's not.
We're right.
She has to go back.
If she actually dies of embarrassment, I'll never forgive myself.
- So, what is this thing?
- A liver spot.
Oh-ho-ho, no.
Oh-ho-ho, God.
- A liver spot?
- It's benign.
My father had liver spots.
He looked like a Dalmatian.
So, what's this family talk about, guys?
- It's private, Oliver.
- Oh, I see.
- So would you please excuse us?
- Sure.
Get out of my house!
- Oh, you mean go?
- Yes.
- Why didn't you say?
Bye, guys.
- You know something?
- What's that?
- Oliver!
What?
- We were great with Jen.
- We were.
We were a team.
George, I want us to be a team.
Does that mean we should get uniforms?
Come on, George.
It means that we did something together and it felt great.
We've gotta do that without the kids, but you're never here.
- What do you want me to do?
- Cut back on your practice.
Do I tell a guy in cardiac arrest, "Sorry, meeting my wife for sushi"?
George, do you know why I'm going to New York with Jenny?
Not just to help her.
To be with someone who needs me.
Think about it.
Think about that.
I've got the second half of my life to take care of.
And I don't want to do it alone.
Then Renee calls and says she's got an agent.
- Oh, nice.
- Not nice, Oliver.
Within six days she has an agent who'll get her commercials.
Who knows what the hell she'll do?
It'd be funny if she never came back.
This house is so empty without her.
I'm Ionely.
That's why I never got married.
I didn't want to be Ionely.
And I didn't want somebody else driving my car.
You're out of Perrier.
This is what Renee was talking about.
She was Ionely.
You're out of beer and peanut butter.
Hell, George, get her back.
I'm gonna starve to death.
Oh, Dorothy.
What a nice surprise.
For you maybe.
George, I wanted to talk.
Do I detect a note of hostility?
A note?
How about a symphony?
We thought you might like to join us for dinner.
I get the feeling you might be mad at me.
Why?
How about stopping by New Year's Eve with three naked women, throwing up in the pool, passing out in the punchbowl, and relieving yourself in the linen closet?
That was six months ago.
George, what do you say?
- We'd really love to have you.
- Maybe some other time.
What about forgive and forget, Dot?
I am not "Dot".
Goodbye, George.
Goodbye, Dot.
- Where are you going?
- New York.
- Great, let's do it.
- You're not invited.
- I'm going alone.
- Yeah, but we could Hi, Ma.
Hey, how'd you like to have Come on, that was three or four months ago.
Coming.
Thank God.
I was a wreck.
I sat there every night with Oliver, Ionely as hell.
I didn't know what was going on.
I thought, "What if I lose her?
What would I do without her?
I want her here with me and I want to be there with her".
So, here I am.
And there's going to be some changes.
And I love you.
Why the hell are you opening a door without saying, "Who's there"?
I wasn't going to stay here, George.
I missed you.
I couldn't stand it.
And I realize I've been going too fast for you.
You can't change overnight.
I'd like to try.
Here's step one.
I drew a sketch on the plane.
I've decided to make an office in the house and move my practice there.
- No?
- Yeah.
And I got Maz Lansky to take part of my patient load.
I got him to take it all for three days while we're here on our second honeymoon.
George, I love you.
I love you, too.
But, honey, this isn't our second honeymoon.
It's our third?
- We never had one.
- Of course we had one.
George, you were an intern.
Two hours in a hospital bed next to a man in a coma isn't a honeymoon.
- I lied.
He wasn't in a coma.
- Oh!
- What if I make it up to you?
- How?
Oh, George.
What a great three days.
This has been a wonderful honeymoon.
It should be.
You waited long enough.
Mm.
You think we'll stay like this always?
I think eventually we'll have to go to the bathroom.
- And you'll love me always?
- Always.
Because I won't always look like this.
Honey.
You don't look like you did ten years ago.
Promise me you'll never get your teeth bonded and go with stewardesses.
I promise.
- You swear?
- I swear.
I love you.
I love you too, sweetheart.
- George.
- Hm?
Promise me one more thing.
What?
Promise me you'll never die.
