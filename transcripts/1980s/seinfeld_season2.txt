{START OF EPISODE 1}
I'm always in traffic with the lane expert.
Do you know this type of person?
Constantly re-evaluating their lane choice.
Never quite sure: " Is this the best lane for me, for my life"?
They're always a little bit ahead.
" Can I get in over there?
Can I get ahead of you"?
Yeah, come on over here, pal.
We're zooming over here.
This is the secret lane, nobody knows about it.
The ultimate I think the ultimate psychological test of traffic is the total dead stop.
Not even rolling and you look out the window, you see gum clearly.
But we know that in the future, traffic will get even worse than that.
What will happen?
Will it start moving backwards?
Is that possible?
That someday we'll be going, " Boy, this is some really bad traffic now.
This is really bad.
I'm gonna try and get off, and get back on going the other way".
- She can't kill me, right?
- No, of course not.
- People break up all the time.
- Every day.
It just didn't work out.
What can I do?
I wanted to love her.
I tried to love her.
I couldn't.
You tried.
I'd be looking at her face, I'd go, " Come on.
Love her.
Love her".
- Did you tell her you loved her?
- I had no choice.
She squeezed it out of me.
She'd tell me she loved me.
All right, so at first, I'd just look at her.
I'd go, "Oh, really"?
Or, " Boy, that's That's something".
But eventually, you have to come back with: "Well, I love you".
You know, you can only hold out for so long.
- You're a human being.
- I didn't even ask her out.
She asked me out first.
She called me up.
What was I supposed to do, say no?
I can't do that to someone.
- You're too nice a guy.
- I am.
I'm a nice guy.
And then she seduced me.
We're in my apartment, I'm on the couch, she's on the chair.
I get up to go to the bathroom, I come back she's on the couch.
What am I supposed to do?
Not do anything?
I couldn't.
I would've insulted her.
- You're flesh and blood.
- I had nothing to do with any of this.
I met all her friends.
I didn't want to meet them.
I kept trying to avoid it.
I knew it would only get me in deeper.
But they were everywhere.
They kept popping up all over the place.
"This is Nancy, Susan, Amy, my cousin, my brother, my father".
- It's like I'm in quicksand here.
- I told you when I met her.
My back is killing me.
You gotta go to my chiropractor.
He's the best.
- Everybody's guy is the best.
- I'll make an appointment for you.
- We'll go together.
- Please, they don't do anything.
Do I have to break up with her in person?
Can't I do it over the phone?
- I have no stomach for these things.
- Do it like a Band-Aid.
One motion, right off!
- Hi.
- Hi.
- What are you doing?
- I'm letting you in.
No, I don't want to sit in back.
I'll be left out of the conversation.
- No, you won't.
- Yes, I will, George.
I'll have to stick my chin on top of the seat.
- Okay.
- Why can't you sit in the middle?
Please.
It doesn't look good.
Boy, boy, girl.
I think you're afraid to sit next to a man.
You're a little homophobic, aren't you?
Is it that obvious?
- Hello, Jerry.
- Hello.
- Did you get a haircut?
- Nope.
Shower.
So where are we eating?
Tell me if you think this is strange.
There's this guy who lives in my building who I was introduced to a couple years ago.
He's a teacher or something.
Anyway, after we met, whenever we'd run into each other in the street or in the lobby, or whatever we would stop and chat a little bit.
Nothing much.
Little pleasantries.
He's a nice guy.
He's got a family.
Then after a while, I noticed there was no more stopping, just saying hello and continuing on our way.
And then the verbal hellos stopped and we just went into these little sort of nods of recognition.
So fine, I figure, that's where this relationship is finally gonna settle.
Polite nodding.
Then one day he doesn't nod.
Like I don't exist?
He went from nods to nothing.
Now there's this intense animosity whenever we pass.
I mean, it's like we really hate each other.
It's based on nothing.
A relationship is an organism.
You created this thing and then you starved it, so it turned against you.
Same thing happened in The Blob.
I think you absolutely have to say something to this guy.
Confront him.
- Really?
- Yes.
- Would you do that?
- Lf I was a different person.
Hello?
Hello, is Glen there?
I'm sorry.
Is this 805-555-3234?
Yes, I know I have the wrong number.
I want to know if I dialled wrong or Why do people do that?
Come on up.
Oh, it's you again.
See?
If you'd answered me, I wouldn't have had to do this.
That's two long-distance calls I've made to you.
Why can't you?
Why?
Why do they just hang up like that?
Thank you very much.
- Taste this.
- No, I just had a sandwich.
- No, taste it.
- I don't want cantaloupe now.
- You never had it like this before.
- I only eat cantaloupe - Jerry, this is great cantaloupe.
- All right.
- It's very good.
It's good.
- It's good, huh?
I got it at Joe's, 49 cents a pound.
That's practically half than what you pay at the supermarket.
I don't know why you don't go to Joe's.
It's too far.
It's three blocks further.
You could use my shopping cart.
I'm not pulling a shopping cart.
Am I supposed to wear a kerchief put stockings on rolled below my knee?
The other thing is, if you don't like anything he takes it back.
- I don't return fruit.
Fruit's a gamble.
I know that going in.
I did it!
It's over.
- You did it?
What happened?
- I told her, in the kitchen.
Which was risky, because it's near all the knives.
I started with the word " listen".
I said: " Listen, Marlene".
The next thing I know, I'm in the middle of it.
There's this voice inside me going, "You're doing it".
Then she started to cry, and I weakened a little bit.
I almost relented, but the voice, Jerry, the voice said: " Keep going.
Keep going.
You're almost out".
It's like I was making a prison break.
I'm heading for the wall.
And I trip and twist my ankle and they throw that light on you.
You know?
Somehow I get through the crying and I keep running.
Then the cursing started.
She's firing at me from the guard towers.
"Son of a" Bang!
"Son of a" Boom!
I get to the top of the wall, the front door I open it up, I'm one foot away.
I take one last look around the penitentiary, and I jump!
See?
Never as bad as you imagine.
I like that Marlene.
What's her number?
Yeah, no, l I don't think so.
Could you stop that smacking?
George, I want you to taste this cantaloupe.
- No, thank you.
- It's the best cantaloupe I've had.
- No, really.
- I'll get you a piece.
- Jerry, tell him how good it is.
- Very good cantaloupe.
So that's it.
You're out.
Except for one small problem.
I left some books in her apartment.
So?
Go get them.
No, I can't go back there.
Jerry, it's so awkward.
It could be dangerous, sexually.
Something could happen.
I'd be right back where I started from.
So forget about the books.
- Did you read them?
- Well, yeah.
What do you need them for?
I don't know.
They're books.
What is this obsession people have with books?
They put them in their houses like they're trophies.
What do you need it for after you read it?
They're my books.
So you want me to get the books, is that it?
So it must have been 95 degrees that night and everyone's standing around the pool with little drinks in their hands.
I was wearing my old jeans and T-shirt.
I don't know, I was just in one of those moods so I said to myself, " Marlene, just do it".
And I jumped in.
As I'm getting out, I feel all these eyes on me.
So I look up, and everyone is just staring at me.
So, what did you do?
Well, nothing.
It's no skin off my hide if people like to look.
I just didn't see what the big attraction was.
Well, I have a general idea what it was.
I could take a guess.
Hey, you know, Jerry just because George and I don't see each other doesn't mean we shouldn't stay friends.
No.
Good enough.
I'm really glad we got that settled.
Great.
I don't know how this happened.
Jerry, it's not my fault.
No, it's not your fault.
" Books, books, I need my books".
Have you reread those books yet, by the way?
The great thing, when you read Moby Dick the second time Ahab and the whale become good friends.
It's not like Marlene's a bad person or anything but, my God, we've had three lunches and a movie and she never stops calling.
And it's those meaningless, purposeless, blather calls.
She never asks if I'm busy or anything.
I just pick up the phone and she's in the middle of a sentence.
It's standard.
Has she left you a message where she uses up the whole machine?
You know, sometimes she'll go, " Hello, Jerry"?
And I'll go, "Oh, hi, Marlene".
And then it's, "Jerry I don't know sometimes".
- " Know sometimes".
What about trying to get off the phone?
You can't.
It's impossible.
There's no break in the conversation where you can go: "All right, then".
You know, it just goes on and on without a break in the wall.
I mean, I've gotta put a stop to this.
Just do it like a Band-Aid.
One motion.
Right off!
She is sexy, though.
- Don't you think?
- Yeah.
Yeah, she is.
- Mr. Costanza?
- Yeah?
The doctor will see you now.
Yeah.
" Doctor".
I'm gonna have to wait in that little room all by myself, aren't I?
I better take this.
I hate the little room.
Oh, hello, doctor.
Waiting room.
I hate when they make you wait in the room.
Because it says waiting room.
There's no chance of not waiting because they call it the waiting room.
They're gonna use it.
It's all set up for you to wait.
You sit there and you got your little magazine.
You pretend you read it, but you're really looking at other people.
You know, you're thinking about them.
Things like: " I wonder what he's got".
And, "Soon as she goes, I'm getting her magazine".
Then they finally call you, and it's a very exciting moment.
They finally call you.
You stand up and kind of look around at the other people.
"Well, I guess I've been chosen.
I'll see you all later".
You think you're gonna see the doctor, but you're not, are you?
No.
You're going into the next waiting room.
The littler waiting room.
But if they are doing some sort of medical thing to you you want to be in the smallest room that they have.
I think.
You don't want to be in the largest room that they have.
You ever see these operating theatres that they have with, like, stadium seating?
You don't want them doing anything that makes other doctors go, " I have to see this.
Are you kidding?
Are they gonna really do that to him?
Are there seats?
Can we get in"?
Do they scalp tickets to these things?
" I got two for the Winslow tumour.
I got two".
So how was it?
I was in there for two minutes.
He didn't do anything.
Touch this, feel that.
7 5 bucks.
Well, it's a first visit.
What's 7 5 bucks?
What, am I seeing Sinatra in there?
Am I being entertained?
I don't understand this.
I'm only paying half.
- You can't do that.
- Why not?
He's a doctor.
You gotta pay what he says.
No, no, no.
I pay what I say.
You feeling weird?
No.
I'm fine.
- Nothing really happened.
- Yeah.
I know.
We just kissed a little.
People kiss.
Yeah.
Well Night.
Good night.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- I got it.
This time I got it.
- All right.
Hips.
See, it's all in the hips.
Gotta come through with the hips first.
That is out there.
Definitely.
- Joe's?
- No.
Supermarket.
Well, is it good?
- It's It's okay.
- Let me taste that.
See?
That stinks.
- You can't eat that.
Take that back.
- I'm not taking it back.
- I'll take it back.
- I don't care about it.
You should care.
Cantaloupe like this should be out of circulation.
All right.
Take it back.
- No.
- Leave a message.
I'll call you back.
Jerry, have you ever tak en a bath in the dark?
I'm not talking into the soap right now.
Call me back.
Who was that?
- Marlene.
- Mar - Marlene.
- Yeah.
I took her home one night.
We started up a little in the car.
- I thought you were getting rid of her.
- I was.
But she's got me, like, hypnotized or something.
- Does George know?
- No.
He'd go nuts.
Yeah, no kidding.
I feel terrible.
I've seen her a couple of times since then and I know I can't go any further, but She's got this psychosexual hold over me.
I just want her.
I can't breathe.
It's like a drug.
Psychosexual.
I don't know how I'm gonna tell him.
Man, I don't understand people.
Why would George want to deprive you of pleasure?
Is it just me?
It's partially you, yeah.
You're his friend.
Better that she should sleep with someone else?
Some jerk that he doesn't even know?
- He can't kill me, right?
- You're a human being.
She called me.
I never called her.
She started it.
- You're flesh and blood.
- I'm a nice guy.
- Hi.
- Hi, Elaine.
My little airplane lamp.
You have the slowest elevator in the entire city.
That's hard to get used to when you're on so many fast ones.
Apartment elevators are always slower than offices because you don't have to be home on time.
- Unless you're married to a dictator.
- Yeah.
Because they'd be very demanding people.
Right.
Exactly.
I imagine at some point somebody's gonna offer me some cantaloupe?
No.
No good.
Well, you know what they say, lucky in love, unlucky with fruit.
Well, I'm taking this back.
So I had what you might call a little encounter this morning.
Really?
That guy who stopped saying hello?
- Yes.
- You talk to him?
Yes.
I spotted him getting his mail.
At first I was just gonna walk on by but then I thought, " No, no.
- Do not be afraid of this man".
- Right.
So I walked up behind him, tapped him on the shoulder and said: " Hi, remember me"?
And he furrows his brow as if he's really trying to figure it out.
So I said to him I said, "You little phoney.
You know exactly who I am".
- You said, "You little phoney"?
- I did.
I most certainly did.
And he goes, "Oh, yeah, you're Jeanette's friend.
We did meet once".
I said, " How do you go from that to totally ignoring a person when they walk by"?
- This is amazing.
And he says, " Look, I just didn't want to say hello anymore, all right"?
And I said, " Fine.
I didn't want to say hello anymore either.
But I just wanted you to know that I'm aware of it".
You are the queen of confrontation.
You're my new hero.
You've inspired me.
I'm gonna call George about something right now.
This cantaloupe stinks.
I don't care.
- You're kidding.
- No, I don't care.
- You mean that?
- Absolutely.
- You don't care?
- No.
- How could you not care?
- I don't know, but I don't.
Actually, I'm almost happy to hear it.
- I thought you'd be upset.
- I guess I should be, but I'm not.
Am I a bad person?
Did I do something terrible?
You're a fine person.
You're a humanitarian.
She's very sexy.
- That voice.
She's driving me crazy.
- I know.
I know.
I can see her tonight and you don't care?
See her tonight.
See her tomorrow.
Go, knock yourself out.
- She's too crazy for me.
- All right.
As long as you're okay.
- I can't stop thinking about it.
- I'm okay.
I'm fine.
I'm wonderful.
I never felt better in my whole life.
Good.
I'll tell you what.
You don't have to pay the $35 I gave the chiropractor for the rest of your bill.
You paid that crook?
- I had to.
- He didn't do anything, Jerry.
- It's a scam.
Who told you to do that?
- It was embarrassing to me.
I was trying to make a point.
Why don't you make a point with your own doctor?
What's wrong?
- I think I swallowed a fly.
- Oh, God.
I swallowed a fly!
What do I do?
What can happen?
So you want to come up for a few minutes?
I'm sorry, Jerry.
I just don't think this is gonna work.
Really?
- I thought - I know.
I'm sorry.
I just didn't expect it from the way you've been acting.
Are you sure you want to talk about this?
I sure don't.
Of course I want to talk about it.
Well, okay.
I guess things changed for me on Tuesday night.
Tuesday night?
What happened Tuesday night?
I saw your act.
My act?
What does that have to do with anything?
Well, to be honest it just didn't make it for me.
It's just so much fluff.
I can't believe this.
What are you saying?
You didn't like my act?
So that's it?
I can't be with someone if I don't respect what they do.
You're a cashier.
Look, Jerry, it just wasn't my kind of humour.
You can't go by the audience.
It was late, they were terrible.
I heard the material.
I have other stuff.
You should come see me on the weekend.
Women need to like the job of the guy they're with.
If they don't like the job, they don't like the guy.
Men know this.
Which is why we make up the phoney, bogus names for the jobs we have.
" Right now, I'm the regional management supervisor.
I'm in development, research, consulting".
Men, on the other hand, if they are physically attracted to a woman are not that concerned with her job, are we?
Men don't really care.
Men just go, " Really, slaughterhouse?
That where you work?
Interesting.
You got a big cleaver, just lopping their heads off?
Sounds great.
Listen, why don't you shower up and we'll get some burgers and catch a movie".
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
My parents live in Florida now.
They moved there last year.
They didn't wanna move to Florida, but they're in their 60s and that's the law.
And you know how it works.
They got the leisure police.
They pull up in front of the old people's house with the golf cart.
" Let's go, pop.
White belt, white pants, white shoes, get in the back.
Drop the snow shovel, right there.
Drop it"!
I am not much for the family gathering.
You ever sit there, and the conversation's so boring, it's so dull?
And you start to fantasize.
You know, you think: "What if I just got up and jumped out that window?
I wonder what" Just crash right through the glass, you know.
Come back.
There's broken glass.
Everybody's upset.
" No, I'm all right.
I was just a little bored there.
And, no, I'm fine.
I came back.
I wanna hear more about that Hummel collection, Aunt Rose.
Let's pick it up right there".
You have so many nice jackets.
I don't know why you had to bring this jacket.
Who wears a jacket like this?
What's wrong with that nice grey one?
You have beautiful clothes.
They sit in your closet.
Morty, you can't wear this.
- Are you getting that?
- I thought you were getting it.
- Should I pick up?
- Do you want me to get that?
- I'll get it.
- I'll get it.
Hello.
Hello.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Would you make this thing lower?
- I can hear it on the street.
- Hey, Jer, how did you do?
We won.
I made an incredible play in the field.
It was a tag-up at third base.
I threw the guy out, from left field, on a fly.
We'll be in the championship game Wednesday because of me.
It was the single greatest moment in my life.
This is your greatest moment, a game?
Well, no.
Sharon Besser, of course.
You know what my greatest moment was, don't you?
In 1 946, I went to work for Harry Flemming and I came up with the idea for the beltless trench coat.
Jerry, look at this sport jacket.
Is this a jacket to wear to an anniversary party?
Well, the man's an individualist.
He worked for Harry Flemming.
- He knows what he's doing.
- But it's their 50th anniversary.
Your mother doesn't like my taste in clothing.
I spoke to Manya and Isaac on the phone today.
They invited you again.
I think you should go.
First of all, I made plans with Elaine.
So bring her.
I don't even know them.
What is she, your second cousin?
I mean, I met them three times in my life.
I don't know her either.
She made me fly from Florida for this, and then she criticizes my jacket.
At least come and say hello, have a cup of coffee, then you leave.
How come he gets to leave?
If I wind up sitting next to Uncle Leo, I am leaving.
He's always grabbing my arm when he talks to me.
I guess because so many people have left in the middle of his conversation.
And it's always about Jeffrey, right?
Yeah.
He talks about him like he split the atom.
The kid works for the Parks Department.
- Morty, you coming in?
- Oh, yeah.
I forgot all about it.
- Hey.
How'd you do?
- We won.
- We're in the finals on Wednesday.
- Yeah!
What is this about?
I'm completely changing the configuration of the apartment.
You're not gonna believe it when you see it.
Whole new lifestyle.
- What are you doing?
- Levels.
- Levels.
- Yeah.
I'm getting rid of all my furniture, all of it and I'm gonna build these different levels.
You know, with steps.
And it'll all be carpeted.
With a lot of pillows.
You know, like ancient Egypt.
- You drew up plans for this?
- No.
No, it's all in my head.
I don't see how you can get comfortable.
Oh, I'll get comfortable.
When do you intend to do this?
Should be done by the end of the month.
- Gonna do this yourself?
- It's a simple job.
- Well, you don't think I can, huh?
- No, it's not that I don't think you can.
I know that you can't, and I'm positive that you won't.
Well, I got the tools.
I got the pillows.
All I need is the lumber.
- Hey, that's some big job.
- I don't see it happening.
Yeah, well, this time This time you're wrong.
- Come on, I'll even bet you.
- Seriously?
I don't want you betting.
Morty, don't let them bet.
A big dinner with dessert, but I got till the end of the month.
- I'll give you a year.
- No, no.
- No, no, a month.
End of the month.
- It's a bet.
Seriously, do you wanna switch chairs?
No, no.
I'm fine.
Oh, Jerry, you listening to this?
Yeah, Uncle Leo.
So now the Parks commissioner is recommending Jeffrey for a citation.
Right, for the reducing of the pond scum?
No, no, no.
For the walking tours.
Oh, yeah, where the people eat the plant life, the edible-foliage tour.
That's exactly right.
He knows the whole history of the park.
For two hours, he's talking and answering questions.
But you wanna know something?
Whenever he has a problem with a high-powered big shot from the Parks Department you know who he calls?
Mickey Mantle?
Jerry.
Jerry.
Did you taste these peas?
These peas are great.
These peas are bursting with country-fresh flavour.
Phenomenal peas.
- Are you ready for dessert?
- Well actually, we do have to kind of get going.
You're going?
- I don't really eat dessert.
I'm dieting.
- Yeah, I can't eat dessert either.
The sugar makes my ankles swell up, and I can't dance.
- Can't dance?
- He's kidding, Manya.
Is that a joke?
So did you hear Claire's getting married?
Yeah, yeah.
I hear the fellow owns a couple racehorses.
- You know, trotters, like at Yonkers.
- Horses.
They're like big riding dogs.
What about ponies, huh?
What kind of abnormal animal is that?
And those kids who had their own ponies.
Oh, I know.
I hated those kids.
In fact, I hate anyone that ever had a pony when they were growing up.
I had a pony.
Well, I didn't really mean a pony per se.
When I was a little girl in Poland we all had ponies.
My sister had pony.
My cousin had pony.
- So, what's wrong with that?
- Nothing, nothing at all.
- I was just merely expressing - Should we have some coffee?
Who's having coffee?
He was a beautiful pony, and I loved him.
Well, I'm sure you did.
Who wouldn't love a pony?
Who wouldn't love a person that had a pony?
You.
You said so.
No, see, we didn't have ponies.
I'm sure at that time in Poland, they were common.
They were probably like compact cars.
That's it.
I had enough.
Have your coffee, everybody.
She's a little upset.
It's been an emotional day.
I didn't know she had a pony.
How was I to know she had a pony?
Who figures an immigrant is gonna have a pony?
Do you know what the odds are on that?
I mean, in all the pictures I saw of immigrants on boats coming into New York Harbour I never saw one of them sitting on a pony.
But why would anyone come here if they had a pony?
Who leaves a country packed with ponies to go to a non-pony country?
It doesn't make sense.
Am I wrong?
- I'll drive you to the airport.
- No, we're taking a cab.
I just hope that whole pony incident didn't put a damper on the trip.
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
It was a misunderstanding.
Hey, I agree with him.
Nobody likes a kid with a pony.
Well, if you ever talk to her, tell her I'm sorry.
Elaine too.
She feels terrible.
- You know, you should call Manya.
- Maybe I will.
- Oh, hi.
Hey.
- Hey.
I just came to say goodbye.
- Hey, need any help with those?
- It's nothing.
I got it.
So how are your levels coming along?
Well, I decided I'm not gonna do it.
Really?
What a shock.
- Goodbye.
We'll call you.
- Take care.
- Bye, Jer.
- Bye, Dad.
Take it easy.
- Bye, Mr. Kramer.
- Yeah, so long, Morty.
So when do I get my dinner?
There's no dinner.
The bet's off.
I'm not gonna do it.
Yes, I know you're not gonna do it.
That's why I bet.
Yeah, well, there's no bet if I'm not doing it.
That's the bet, that you're not doing it.
Yeah, I could do it.
I don't wanna do it.
We didn't bet on if you wanted to do it we bet on if it would be done.
- And it could be done.
- Well, of course it could be done.
Anything could be done, but it only is done if it's done.
Show me the levels.
- The bet is the levels.
- I don't want the levels.
That's the bet.
Man.
Hello.
No.
Oh, hi.
No, they just left.
Oh, my God.
Hang on a second, maybe I can still catch them.
Ma.
Ma, up here.
Don't get in the cab.
Manya died.
Manya died!
- Who'd you talk to?
- Uncle Leo.
- And when's the funeral?
- I don't know, said he'd call back.
You know what this means?
We lost the supersaver.
Those tickets are nonrefundable.
She just had a checkup.
The doctor said she was fine.
- Unless - What?
What?
Nothing.
You don't think?
What, the pony remark?
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
She was an old woman.
You don't think I killed her?
You know what that flight will cost us?
It was an innocent comment.
I didn't know she had a pony.
Maybe we could get an Army transport flight.
They got a base in Sarasota, I think.
I mean, the whole thing was taken out of context.
It was a joke.
That's probably Uncle Leo.
Hello.
Yes, I know.
Well, it's just one of those things.
Sure, sure.
We'll see you then.
The funeral's Wednesday.
Wednesday?
What?
What Wednesday?
Two o'clock, Wednesday.
- What?
- I got a softball game on Wednesday.
It's the championship.
So you're not obligated.
Go play in your game.
- I didn't even know the woman.
- So don't go.
I mean, I met her three times.
I don't even know her last name.
Jerry, no one's forcing you.
I mean, who has a funeral on a Wednesday?
That's what I wanna know.
I mean this is the championship.
I'm hitting everything.
I don't have a dress to wear.
And, you, you don't have anything.
I got my sport jacket.
You're not wearing that to a funeral.
- What's wrong with it?
- It looks ridiculous.
What, I'm gonna buy a new sport jacket now?
I don't know what to do.
You know what this funeral's gonna wind up costing me?
Oh, boy.
We don't understand death.
And the proof of this is that we give dead people a pillow.
And, I mean, hey, you know.
I think if you can't stretch out and get some solid rest at that point I don't see how bedding accessories really make the difference.
I mean, they got the guy in a suit, with a pillow.
Now, is he going to a meeting, or is he catching 40 winks?
I mean, let's make up our mind where we think they're going.
I actually like ponies.
I was just trying to make conversation.
- What time is your game?
- 2:45.
- And what time is the funeral?
- Two o'clock.
How long does a funeral take?
Depends on how nice the person was but you gotta figure even Oswald took 45 minutes.
So you can't do both.
You know, if the situation were reversed and Manya had some mahjong championship or something I wouldn't expect her to go to my funeral.
I would understand.
How can you even consider not going?
You know, I've been thinking.
I cannot envision any circumstance in which I'll ever have the opportunity to have sex again.
How's it gonna happen?
I just don't see how it could occur.
You know, funerals always make me think about my own mortality and how I'm actually gonna die someday.
Me, dead.
Imagine that.
They always make me take stock of my life how I've pretty much wasted all of it and how I plan to continue wasting it.
I know, then you say to yourself: " From this moment on, I'm not gonna waste any more of it".
But then you go, " How?
I mean, what can I do that's not wasting it"?
Well, is this a waste of time?
What should we be doing?
- Can't you have coffee with people?
- You know You know, I can't believe you're even considering not playing.
We need you.
You're hitting everything.
He has to go.
He may have killed her.
Me?
What about you?
You brought up the pony.
Oh, yeah, but I didn't say I hated anyone who had one.
- Who's gonna play left field?
- Bender?
Bender?
He can't play left.
He stinks.
I just don't see what purpose it's gonna serve, you going.
I mean, you think dead people care who's at their funeral?
They don't even know they're having a funeral.
It's not like she's in the back going, " I can't believe Jerry didn't show up".
Maybe she's there in spirit.
How about that?
If you're a spirit, and you can travel to other dimensions and galaxies and find out the mysteries of the universe you think she'll be at Drexler's Funeral Home on Ocean Parkway?
George, I met this woman.
She is not travelling to any other dimensions.
Do you know how easy it is for dead people to travel?
It's not like getting on a bus.
One second: It's all mental.
Fifty years they were married.
Now he's moving to Phoenix.
Phoenix?
What's happening with his apartment?
I don't know.
They've been in there since, like, World War II.
Rent's $300 a month.
Three hundred a month?
Oh, my God.
Although this may seem like a sad event it should not be a day of mourning for Manya had a rich, fulfilling life.
She grew up in a different world, a simpler world with loving parents, a beautiful home in the country.
And from what I understand, she even had a pony.
Oh, how she loved that pony.
Even in her declining years, whenever she would speak of it her eyes would light up.
Its lustrous coat, its flowing mane.
It was the pride of Cracow.
Well, game's starting just about now.
It was good that the two of you came.
It was a nice gesture.
I'm not a doctor yet, Uncle Morty.
I'm just an intern.
I can't write a note to an airline.
You got your degree.
They don't care.
They just wanna see something.
- I just wanted to say how sorry I was.
- Jerry you wanna hear something?
Your cousin Jeffrey is switching parks.
They're transferring him to Riverside so he'll completely revamp that operation, you understand?
Yeah.
He'll do in Riverside now what he did in Central Park.
More money.
So that's your cousin.
You don't understand.
I've never paid full fare.
Once again, I just wanted to say how sorry I am about the other night.
- Oh, me too.
Oh, no, no, no.
She forgot all about that.
She was much more upset about the potato salad.
So I understand you're moving to Phoenix.
Yeah.
My brother lives there.
I think Manya would've liked Phoenix.
Gorgeous, exquisite town.
So, what's happening with your apartment?
Of course it's very hot there.
I'll have to get an air conditioner.
Oh, you can have mine.
I'll ship it out to you.
But what about that big apartment on West End Avenue?
Although, they say it's a dry heat.
Dry, wet.
What's happening with your apartment?
I don't even know if I should take my winter clothing.
I have an idea.
Leave the winter clothing in the apartment and I'll watch it for you.
And I'll live there, and I'll make sure that nothing happens to it.
Oh, the apartment.
Jeffrey's taking the apartment.
- Oh, Jeffrey.
- You know Jeffrey.
Yeah, from what I understand, he works for the Parks Department.
- It's raining.
- It's raining?
It's raining.
The game will be postponed.
We'll play tomorrow.
Believe me, I wouldn't bother you if the Army hadn't closed that base in Sarasota.
- Here, scribble a little something here.
- I can't.
I'll get in trouble.
Oh, for God's sake.
Who gets picked off in softball?
- It's unheard-of.
- Never happened to me before.
I remember saying to myself, "Why is Jerry so far off the base"?
I'll have to live with this shame for the rest of my life.
Look.
Then in the fifth inning, why did you take off on the pop fly?
I thought there were two outs.
I couldn't believe it when I saw you running.
I thought maybe they had changed the rules or something.
It was the single worst moment of my life.
What about Sharon Besser?
Oh, well, of course, 1 97 3.
- Makes you wonder, doesn't it?
- Wonder about what?
You know, the spirit world.
Wait, you think Manya showed up during the game and put a hex on me?
I never saw anyone play like that.
But I went to the funeral.
Yeah, but that doesn't make up for killing her.
Maybe Manya missed the funeral because she was off visiting another galaxy that day.
Don't you think she would've heard I was there?
Not necessarily.
Who figures an immigrant is gonna have a pony?
What is the pony?
What is the point of the pony?
Why do we have these animals, these ponies?
What do we do with them, besides the pony ride?
Well, why ponies?
What are we doing with them?
I mean, police don't use them for, you know, crowd control.
" Hey, you wanna get back behind the barricades?
Hey.
Hey, little boy.
Yeah, I'm talking to you.
Just Behind the barricades".
So somebody, I assume, genetically engineered these ponies.
Think they could make them any size?
Like the size of a quarter if they want?
That would be fun for Monopoly, wouldn't it?
Have a little pony.
And you put him on the " Baltic, that's two down.
Go ahead.
Hold it.
There.
Baltic, that's Yeah, Fine.
Right there, hold it right there".
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
I hate clothes, okay?
I hate buying them.
I hate picking them out of my closet.
I can't stand every day trying to come up with little outfits for myself.
I think eventually fashion won't even exist.
We'll all be wearing the same thing.
Because any time I see a movie or a TV show where there's people from the future they're all wearing the same thing.
Somehow they decided, "This is going to be our outfit".
One-piece silver jumpsuit, V-stripe and boots.
That's it.
We should come up with an outfit for Earth.
An Earth outfit.
We should vote on it.
Candidates propose different outfits.
No speeches.
They walk out, twirl, walk off.
We just sit in the audience and go, "That was nice.
I could wear that".
- I think I've seen enough.
- I might have something in the back.
The back?
They never find anything in the back.
If they had anything good, they'd put it in the front.
Why don't they open an entire store for the back?
Call it "Just Back".
All back.
No front.
You walk in the front, you're immediately in the back.
Look, Elaine.
Tie carwash.
- I just read that.
That's terrific.
- Her father wrote that.
- Alton Benes is your father?
- Yeah.
I always felt he deserved a wider audience.
I'm not so sure he wants one.
Hey, don't forget Sunday, okay?
You and George are coming, right?
Hotel Westbury, 8:00.
Yeah, I guess I'm coming.
I mean - What, you don't wanna go now?
- No, I'll go.
I'm going.
No, Jerry, you have to.
I need a buffer.
I haven't seen my father in a while, and, you know, it's I'm worried I won't be able talk to him.
He's such a great writer.
Frankly, I prefer the company of nitwits.
So that's why we're not together anymore.
What is this?
This is beautiful.
These jackets never fit me right.
Try it on.
Wow.
This is soft suede.
This may be the most perfect jacket I have ever put on.
- How much is it?
- Oh, my God.
Bad?
- Very bad?
- You have no idea.
- I have some idea.
- No idea.
- I've got a ballpark.
- There's no park and the team has relocated.
Let me see that.
That is high.
Oh, man, that is a beautiful jacket, though.
What's with the pink lining with the candy stripes?
It's just lining.
You can always have it changed.
Should I get it?
I hate these moments.
I'm hearing the dual voices now, you know?
"What about the money"?
"What's money"?
It looks wonderful on you.
- Hey.
- Hey.
New jacket.
- What do you think?
- It's beautiful.
- Is it me?
- That's definitely you.
- Really?
- That's more you than you've ever been.
- What is with the pink lining?
- I don't know.
It's got a pink lining.
- So, what'd you pay for this?
- I paid what it costs.
- How much?
- What's the difference?
- You're not gonna tell me?
- I'd rather not say out loud.
It's embarrassing.
- Over 300?
- Yes.
But let's just stop it right there.
- It's over 400.
- I'm really not answering anymore.
- Is it over 400?
- Would you?
Whoa, Nelson.
I know.
I know.
What are you gonna do with the leather one?
I don't know.
Are you gonna wear it?
- I don't know, maybe.
- Well, you're not gonna wear this.
Do you want it?
Yeah, okay, I'll take it.
I like that jacket.
- Okay, take it.
- Hey.
Good karma for you.
Oh, baby.
What is that song?
It's from Les Misérables.
I went to see it last week.
I can't get it out of my head.
I just keep singing it over and over.
It just comes out.
I have no control over it.
I'm singing it on elevators, buses.
Singing in front of clients.
It's taking over my life.
You know, Schumann went mad from that.
Artie Schumann from Camp Hatchapee?
- No, you idiot.
- What are you, Bud Abbott?
What are you calling me an idiot for?
You don't know Robert Schumann, the composer?
Oh, Schumann.
Of course.
He went crazy from one note.
Couldn't get it out of his head.
I think it was an A. He kept repeating it over and over again.
He had to be institutionalised.
Really?
Well, what if it doesn't stop?
Oh, that I really needed to hear.
That helps a lot.
All right, just say something.
Just start talking.
Change the subject.
Let's just go, all right?
I can't believe we're having dinner with Alton Benes.
I know exactly what's gonna happen.
I'm gonna try and act like I'm not impressed.
- He'll see right through it.
- He'll look at us like he's backstage at a puppet show.
Let me just get my jacket.
This is huge.
- When did this happen?
- Wednesday.
This jacket has completely changed my life.
When I leave the house in this it's with a whole different confidence.
Like, tonight I might've been a little nervous, but inside this jacket I am composed, grounded, secure that I can meet any social challenge.
Can I say one thing to you?
And I say this with an unblemished record of staunch heterosexuality.
Absolutely.
It's fabulous.
- I know.
- And I'll tell you something else l'm not even gonna ask you.
I wanna know, but I'm not gonna ask.
You'll tell me when you feel comfortable.
So, what was it, 400?
Five hundred?
Did you pay 500 for this?
Over 6?
Can't be 7.
Don't tell me you paid $7 00 for this jacket.
Did you pay $7 00 for this jacket?
Is that what you're saying to me?
You are sick!
Is that what you paid for this jacket?
Over 7 00?
!
What did you pay for this jacket?
I won't say anything.
I wanna know what you paid for this jacket.
Oh, my God!
A thousand dollars?
!
You paid $1 000 for this jacket.
All right.
I'm walking out of here right now thinking you paid $1 000 for this jacket unless you tell me different.
All right, I'll tell you what.
If you don't say anything in five seconds, I'll know it was over 1 000.
Hey.
Hey, will you do me a solid?
- What kind of solid?
- Sit in the car for two minutes while it's double-parked.
I gotta pick up some birds.
- Birds?
- A friend of mine, he's a magician.
He's away on vacation.
He asked me to take care of his doves.
- So take a cab.
- They won't take a cage full of birds.
I can't.
I'm on my way out.
There's no way I can do it.
- George, do me a solid.
Two minutes.
- Well, I'm going with him.
I'd like to.
I've never done a solid before.
All right.
I'll Yeah.
All right.
Have a good one.
Two minutes.
Believe me, I know his two minutes.
By his conception of time, his life will last over 2000 years.
Schumann.
Where are they?
Maybe he didn't show up.
What, you don't wanna do this?
There's never been an appointment in my life where I wanted the other guy to show up.
Wait a second.
Is that him?
Yeah.
I think it is.
Where's Elaine?
I'm nervous.
- Excuse me, Mr. Benes.
- Yeah.
I'm Jerry, Elaine's friend.
This is George.
It's a great thrill to meet you, sir.
Sit down.
- Want a drink?
- Sure.
- What'll you have?
- Cranberry juice with two limes.
And I'll have a club soda with no ice.
I'll have another scotch with plenty of ice.
You like ice.
- I say, do you like ice?
- Like it?
Don't you find that you get more without it?
- Where's Elaine?
- Well, we thought she was meeting you earlier.
She's usually pretty punctual.
Don't you find that, George?
Yeah.
Yeah, she's punctual, and she's been late sometimes.
Yeah, yeah.
Sometimes she's on time and sometimes she's late.
I guess today she's late.
It appears that way.
- Yep.
- Yep.
- Looks like rain.
- I know.
I know.
That's what they said.
- Who said?
- The weather guy, Dr. Waldo.
I don't need anybody to tell me it's gonna rain.
Oh, no.
Of course not.
L All I have to do is stick my head out the window.
Which one's supposed to be the funny guy?
- Oh, he's the comedian.
- I'm just a regular person.
No, no.
He's just being modest.
We had a funny guy with us in Korea.
A tail gunner.
They blew his brains out all over the Pacific.
There's nothing funny about that.
Would you excuse me?
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
I'll be right back.
I just wanted to tell you that I really enjoyed Fair Game.
I thought it was just brilliant.
Drivel.
Yeah, maybe some parts.
What parts?
The drivel parts.
Oh, my gosh.
I just realized I have to make a phone call.
I can't believe Would you?
I'll be right back.
Thank you for leaving me alone with him.
That was brutal.
I can't go back out there.
- Well, let's just leave.
- Elaine will kill me.
- Where is she?
- She's gotta be here soon.
How could she leave us alone with this lunatic?
Ten more minutes, and that's it, I'm leaving.
I have to tell you, this guy scares me.
The waiter was trembling.
We can't possibly have dinner with him alone.
- How we gonna get out of it?
- We say we're frightened and we have to go home.
Yeah, that's good.
He'd clunk our heads together like Moe.
I don't know.
Just start scratching.
Tell him you have the crabs.
He was in the military.
He'll understand that.
All fathers are intimidating.
They're intimidating because they are fathers.
Once a man has children, for the rest of his life his attitude is: "The hell with the world, I can make my own people.
I'll eat whatever I want.
I'll wear whatever I want and I'll create whoever I want".
Who'd you call?
My uncle is having an operation.
I just wanted to see how he was.
What kind of an operation?
Bone marrow.
- Mr. Benes?
- Yeah.
Message for you.
From Elaine.
She got tied up.
She'll be here in 30 minutes.
Yeah, they should have taken care of Castro when they had the chance.
Like we did in Guatemala in '53.
- Well, Guatemala - Sure.
Guatemala.
All right.
You boys get yourselves together.
We'll head up to the restaurant.
I'll leave a note for Elaine.
I'm going to the bathroom.
- Let's go.
- What about Elaine?
- Hell with Elaine.
- She'll be furious.
We're dying here!
That's her.
She's here.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Where is Dad?
He's in the bathroom.
Where have you been?
Kramer.
That Kramer.
I'm just about to leave, he calls me up.
He begs me to sit in his car for two minutes so he can pick up these birds.
Oh, you didn't.
Well, he said he'd drive me here right after.
So I am sitting in his car for 20 minutes!
He doesn't come down.
I am freezing.
Then a cop comes by.
Tells me to get out of the car.
He's a city marshal.
He's towing the car away.
Kramer owes thousands of dollars in back tickets.
He was gonna tow it with me in the car.
So they tow the car.
Now I am standing outside and I am freezing, but I cannot leave because I gotta tell him what happened to the car.
So finally, finally, he comes down with this giant cage filled with doves.
He said he was getting instructions, that each dove has a different diet.
So we're wandering around, trying to get a cab when two of these doves fly out.
Now we're running after these doves.
I almost got hit by a bus.
So how is everything going over here?
- Great.
- Couldn't be better.
Good, because Dad can make some people a little uncomfortable.
- Oh, no.
- Get out of here.
Man, Kramer.
I could kill him.
You know better than to get involved with Kramer.
- He said he'd give me a lift.
- The lift.
Like the lure of the Siren's song.
Never what it seems to be.
Yet who among us can resist?
Where do you come up with this stuff?
- Well, look who's here.
- Oh, hi, Dad.
Hello, dear.
- Who's the lipstick for?
- No one.
- How's your mother?
- Fine.
How about you, are you working?
Yeah.
I'm reading manuscripts for Pendant Publishing.
I told you 1 0 times.
Pendant?
Those bastards.
Well, all right, boys.
We'll go to that Pakistani restaurant on 46th Street.
You're not afraid of a little spice, are you?
Pipe down, chorus boy.
Chorus boy?
It's snowing.
It's beautiful.
Snow?
Snow, that can't be good for suede, can it?
I wouldn't think so.
What should I do?
We're taking a cab, aren't we?
Cab?
It's only five blocks.
- Why don't you turn it inside out?
- Inside out.
Great.
Wait a minute.
- What the hell do you call this?
- I turned my jacket inside out.
Well, you look like a damn fool.
Well, it's a new suede jacket.
It might get ruined.
Well, you're not walking with me and my daughter dressed like that.
That's for damn sure.
It's It's only a few blocks.
- Elaine?
- Yeah.
Come on up.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- I gotta feed the birds.
- So?
You got any of those Mini Ritzes?
I can't believe that I do.
- What, are you going out?
- Yeah.
Hey, where's your new jacket?
- Oh, what'd you do to it?
- I was out in the snow last night.
Don't you know what that does to suede?
I have an idea.
We can make the 9:30 at Cinema Three.
Okay.
Hello.
Thanks again for coming last night.
Dad said he had a great time.
- Is he still in town?
- He's driving back to Maryland tonight.
So, what are you gonna do with that one now?
- I don't know.
- Well I didn't wanna tell you this, but usually he hates everyone.
Really?
- You gonna throw this out?
- Well, I can't wear it.
Yeah, he liked you, though.
Said you reminded him of somebody he knew in Korea.
Well, if you're just gonna throw it out, you know, I could take it.
Yeah.
Go ahead.
Take it.
Dad thinks George is gay.
Oh, because of all the singing?
No.
He pretty much thinks everyone is gay.
See, I like it like this.
Isn't that?
Is this from the snow last night?
You know what you should have done?
You should have turned it inside out.
I'll try and remember that.
Boy, it's too bad you gave me this one too.
Yeah.
Too bad.
Gonna have to do something about this lining.
I had a leather jacket that got ruined.
Now, why does moisture ruin leather?
I don't get this.
Aren't cows outside most of the time?
I don't understand.
When it's raining, do cows go up to the farmhouse: " Let us in.
We're all wearing leather!
Open the door.
We're gonna ruin the whole outfit here".
" Is it suede"?
" I am suede.
The whole thing is suede.
I can't have this cleaned.
It's all I got".
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
The bad thing about television is that everybody you see on television is doing something better than what you're doing.
You never see anybody on TV sliding off the sofa with crumbs on their face.
Some people have a little too much fun.
The soda commercial people.
Where do they summon this enthusiasm?
Have you seen them?
''We have soda!
We have soda!
We have soda!
'' Jumping, laughing, flying through the air.
lt's a can of soda.
Have you ever been standing there and you're watching TV and you're drinking the exact product that they're advertising right there on TV?
And it's like, you know, they're spiking volleyballs, jet-skiing, girls in bikinis and l'm standing there, '' Maybe l'm putting too much ice in mine.
'' So then, as we were leaving we were just kind of standing there, and she was smiling at me.
l wasn't sure if she wanted me to ask her out.
When women smile, l don't know what it means.
Sometimes l interpret it like they're psychotic.
l don't know if l'm supposed to smile back.
l just stood there.
Remember Quayle when Bentsen gave him the Kennedy line?
That's what l looked like.
-So you didn't ask?
-No.
l froze.
-Counter.
-Oh, yeah.
So wait, wait.
Half-hour later l'm back at the office.
l tell Lloyd the story.
He says, ''Why don't you call her?
'' l says, '' l can't!
'' l couldn't do it then.
For me to ask a woman out, l gotta get into a mental state like karate guys before they break bricks.
So then Lloyd calls me a wuss.
-He said ''wuss''?
-Yeah.
Anyway, he shamed me into it.
-So you called?
-Right.
And to cover my nervousness, l started eating an apple.
l think if they hear you chewing on the other end of the phone -makes you sound casual.
-Yeah, like a farm boy.
Right.
So l call her up, l tell her it's me.
She gives me an enthusiastic '' Hi!
'' Enthusiastic hi, that's beautiful.
l don't get the enthusiastic hi, l'm out of there.
So you're chewing your apple.
You got your enthusiastic hi.
We're talking.
l don't go too long before l ask them out.
l want to get it over with right away.
So l just blurt out, ''What are you doing Saturday night?
'' And?
She bought.
Great day in the morning.
Then l got off the phone right away.
lt's like robbing a bank.
Don't loiter in front of the teller with a bag of money.
You make your hit and get out.
We both have dates on the same night.
l can't remember the last time that happened.
l can't stand doing laundry, that's why l have 40 pairs of underwear.
-You do not.
-Absolutely.
Because instead of doing a wash, l just keep buying underwear.
My goal is to have over 360 pair.
That way, l only have to do wash once a year.
Come on, try it!
Let me hear you try a Scottish accent.
-That's lrish.
-lrish, Scottish.
What's the difference, lassie?
So thanks for dinner.
lt was great.
Yeah.
We should do this again.
Would you like to come upstairs for coffee?
No, thanks.
l can't drink coffee at night.
lt keeps me up.
So.
Okay.
Okay.
Good night.
Yeah.
Take it easy.
-Thanks again for the movie.
-You're welcome.
l'd invite you up, but the place is being painted.
Oh, that's okay.
Unless you want to go to your place.
Okay, but there's no cake or anything, if that's what you're looking for.
''Take it easy.
'' ''Take it easy!
'' l think if one's going to kill oneself the least you could do is leave a note.
lt's common courtesy.
l don't know.
That's just the way l was brought up.
-Values are important.
-So important.
What are you doing Thursday night?
You wanna have dinner?
Thursday's great.
Tan pants.
Why do l buy tan pants, Donna?
l don't feel comfortable in them.
Are those cotton Dockers?
l can't begin to tell you how much l hate that commercial.
Really?
l like that commercial.
You like that commercial?
Yeah.
lt's clever.
You mean the one where the guys are all standing around supposedly being very casual and witty?
Yeah.
That's the one.
What could you possibly like about that?
l don't know.
l like the guys.
Yeah they're so funny and so comfortable with each other.
And l could be comfortable too, if l had pants like that.
l could sit on a porch and wrestle around and maybe even be part of a real bull session.
l know guys like that.
To me, the dialogue rings true.
Even if the dialogue did ring true even if somehow, somewhere men actually talk like that what does that have anything to do with the pants?
Doesn't that bother you?
That's the idea.
That is what is clever about it.
-They're not talking about pants.
-They're talking about nothing.
-That's the point.
-l know the point.
No one is telling you to like it.
All those quick shots of the pants.
Just pants, pants, pants, pants.
What is that supposed to be?
What's brutal about the date is the scrutiny you put each other through.
Because whenever you think about this person in terms of the future, you have to magnify everything about them.
The guy will be like, '' l don't think her eyebrows are even.
Could l look at uneven eyebrows for the rest of my life?
'' Of course, the woman's looking at the guy thinking: ''What is he looking at?
Do l want someone looking at me like this for the rest of my life?
'' l'm supposed to see her again on Thursday.
But can l go out with someone that actually likes this commercial?
l once broke up with a guy because he didn't keep his bathroom clean.
No kidding.
Did you tell him that was the reason?
Yeah.
l told him all the time.
You would not have believed his tub.
Germs were building a town in there.
They were constructing offices.
Houses near the drain were going for $1 50,000.
Hi.
You're still thinking about this?
She invites me up at 1 2:00 at night for coffee.
And l don't go up.
'' No, thank you.
l don't want coffee.
lt keeps me up.
Too late for me to drink coffee.
'' l said this to her.
People this stupid shouldn't be allowed to live.
l can't imagine what she must think of me.
She thinks you're a guy that doesn't like coffee.
She invited me up!
Coffee's not coffee.
-Coffee is sex.
-Maybe coffee was coffee.
Coffee's coffee in the morning, not at 1 2:00 at night.
Some people drink coffee that late.
Yeah, people who work at NORAD who are on 24-hour missile watch.
Everything was going along so great.
She was laughing.
l was funny.
l kept saying to myself, '' Keep it up, don't blow it.
You're doing great.
'' lt's all in your head.
All she knows is she had a good time.
-l think you should call her.
-l can't call her now.
lt's too soon.
l'm planning a Wednesday call.
Why?
l love it when guys call me the next day.
Of course you do, but you're imagining a guy you like.
Not a guy who goes, '' No.
l don't drink coffee late at night.
'' lf l call her now, she's gonna think l'm needy.
Women don't want to see need.
They want a take-charge guy, a colonel, a Kaiser, a czar.
All she'll think is that you like her.
That's exactly what l'm trying to avoid.
She wants you to like her.
Yes, she wants me to like her, if she likes me, but she doesn't like me.
l don't know what your parents did to you.
Hey.
Hey.
l just thought of a really funny thing for your act.
All right.
You're up there.
You're on stage, and you go: ''You ever notice how cars here in New York never get out of the way of ambulances?
Someone's in a life-and-death situation, and we're thinking: 'Sorry, buddy.
Should've thought of that when you were eating cheese omelets for breakfast every morning for the last 30 years.
''' So you gonna use it?
l don't think so.
-Well, it's funny.
-lt's funny.
l like to do my own material.
That's as good as anything you do.
All right, l gotta make a call.
Everybody out.
Come on.
-Why do we have to leave?
-l can't call a woman -with other people in the room.
-Oh, see?
This is the problem.
You're kicking me out of my house?
-Yes.
-Don't forget.
Right.
Jerry, do you have any apples?
Don't do the apples.
lt's enough already with the apples.
Hi, it's Carol.
I'll get back to you.
Hi!
lt's George.
George Costanza.
Remember me?
The guy who didn't come up for coffee.
You see, l didn't realize that coffee didn't really mean.
Well, whatever.
Anyway.
lt was fun.
lt was.
lt was fun, so.
Oh, boy.
So.
You call me back.
lf you want.
That's up to you, you know.
Whatever you want to do.
Either way.
The ball's in your court.
So.
Take it easy.
l'm just getting my jacket.
l'll meet you downstairs.
What's the matter?
Did you call?
Got her machine.
l'm dead.
l'm a dead man.
That's it, l'm dead.
l'm a dead man.
Dead man.
-What'd you say?
-l don't know what the hell l said.
l gave her an ultimatum, and there's nothing l can do.
lt's a machine.
The little light's blinking right now.
'' Come and listen to the idiot.
Hey, everybody, the idiot's on!
'' After one date you try and improvise on a machine?
Now l'm in the worst position of all.
My brother-in-law once left a message on this guy's machine.
And he blurted out business information he wasn't supposed to.
lt would have cost him $1 5,000 so he waited outside the guy's house.
When the guy came home, he went with him and switched the tape.
-He did that?
-Yeah.
Somebody did that?
She'll call you back.
You're overreacting.
-Not once.
-Never?
l have never seen one episode of I Love Lucy in my life ever.
-That's amazing.
-Thank you.
Anything else l should know?
Yes.
l'm lactose intolerant.
-Really?
-l have no patience for lactose and l won't stand for it.
l'll be right back.
Wait till you hear this.
l'm sorry.
l had no idea-- Wait.
Wait.
He's in the bathroom.
l wanted to talk to him for a minute, but l'll come back.
You don't have to leave.
-You sure?
-Yes.
Okay.
-l'm Donna.
-Donna.
You're the one that likes that commercial!
He told you that?
No.
He didn't actually tell me that.
We were talking about that commercial.
ln fact l think l brought it up because l like that commercial.
No.
He would never actually tell me anything like that.
He never discusses anything.
He's-- He's like a clam.
You're not gonna mention this to him--?
So you tell your friends l'm not hip because l like that commercial.
What?
-What did you say?
-Say?
What?
Nothing.
You told him how l like the commercial.
So what if l said that?
You didn't have to tell your friends.
No, l had to tell my friends.
My friends didn't have to tell you.
Why'd you have to get me in trouble?
l don't like you talking about me behind my back.
-Oh, boy.
-l said l couldn't believe you liked that commercial.
So what?
l asked some friends this weekend, all of them like the commercial.
Boy, l bet you got a regular Algonquin Round Table there.
Hey.
Kramer, this is Donna.
-Cotton Dockers!
-Hello.
We should be going.
Come on.
-What?
Where are we going?
-Don't bother.
l'm leaving.
You're making too much of this.
''One hundred percent cotton Dockers.
lf they're not Dockers, they're just pants.
'' Kramer, please.
Donna.
l don't wanna hear it.
l can't believe l said that.
You know me.
l'm a vault.
Don't worry, it wasn't working anyway.
-What happened there?
-l'll tell you later.
You're not gonna believe what's going on with this woman.
You remember l made the initial call Sunday.
She doesn't call back.
l call again Monday.
l leave another message.
l call Tuesday, l get the machine again.
'' l know you're there.
l don't know what your story is.
'' Yesterday, l'm a volcano.
l try one more call.
The machine comes on, and l let fly like Mussolini from the balcony.
''Where the hell do you get the nerve?
You invite me up for coffee, and then you don't call me back for four days?
l don't like coffee.
l don't have to come up!
l'd like to get one more shot at the coffee so l can spit it in your face!
'' -You said that?
-l lost it.
l can't blame you.
l can't believe she never called you back.
She did.
Today.
-What?
-She called my office.
She said she's been in the Hamptons since Sunday.
She didn't know if l was trying to get in touch.
Her machine broke, and she's been using her old machine.
And she doesn't have the beeper for it.
-She didn't get the messages.
-Exactly.
But they're on there waiting.
She can't wait to see me, we're having dinner tonight.
She's supposed to call me when she gets home.
But what about the messages?
Elaine's thing?
How you gonna get in?
l'll meet her outside the building.
But you know as soon as she gets in, she's going for that machine.
Unless she goes for the bathroom, that's my only chance.
Who am l kidding?
l can't do this!
l can't do this!
l don't know how to work the stupid machines.
There's nothing to it.
You lift the lid.
lt comes right out.
-You do it for me.
-What?
Come on.
lt'll be so much easier.
How are you gonna get me up there?
l'll tell her l bumped into you.
l'm giving you a ride uptown.
-Who makes the switch?
-You do.
-l do.
-l can't do it.
l'll keep her busy.
l can't get involved in this.
l think l may be in love with this woman.
What if she sees me?
You are such a wuss.
-A wuss?
-Yeah.
Did you call me a wuss?
Well, there is traffic.
lt might take her till 8: 1 5.
l got one problem.
You're keeping her busy in the other room.
Now what if she somehow gets away from you and is coming in?
You have to signal me that she's coming.
A signal.
Right.
Okay.
The signal is l'll call out ''Tippy-toe!
'' Tippy-toe?
l don't think so.
-You don't like tippy-toe?
-No tippy-toe.
All right.
Okay.
l got it.
-l'll sing.
-What song?
'' How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria?
'' -What is that?
-lt's a lovely song.
Got anything else?
You pick it.
-'' Lemon Tree.
'' -Peter, Paul and Mary?
No.
Trini Lopez.
Okay.
You got the tape?
Standard.
-Micro.
-How do you feel, confident?
-l feel good.
-Nervous?
Not at all.
Get up, get up.
lt's her.
To hell with this!
l'm scared.
Walk away.
Cancel everything.
Hey, what are you doing here?
l was supposed to call you when l got home.
l couldn't wait.
l was too anxious to see you.
That's so sweet.
This is my friend, Jerry Seinfeld.
l just bumped into him around the corner.
lsn't that a coincidence?
The funny thing is, l see him all the time.
-All the time.
-Nice to meet you.
Hi.
So l'm starving.
Where are we gonna eat?
You know, we could go uptown and that way we can give Jerry a ride home.
Okay.
Let's go.
l'm ready.
Where'd you park?
Don't you want to go upstairs first?
No.
What for?
l'll just give my bag to the doorman.
You know l really need to use the bathroom.
There's a bathroom in the coffee shop just next door.
Yes.
Yes.
-But l have to make a call, so-- -Well, they have a phone.
l know Jerry.
He has this phobia about public toilets.
l think we really should go upstairs.
You know, l think l will go upstairs.
l can check my machine.
Right.
Right.
The bathroom's down the hall to the right.
You know why don't you go first?
You just had a long trip.
No, l'm fine.
You know, it's the damnedest thing.
lt went away.
Well, that's weird.
No, no, that can happen.
l've read about that in medical journals.
lt's a freak thing.
Let me just check my messages and we'll go.
-Carol, could l talk to you right now?
-Sure.
Please, this is-- This is very important.
Tippy-toe!
Tippy-toe!
Lemon tree!
Now l know who you are.
You're a comedian.
l've seen you.
lt's been driving me crazy.
Right.
l am.
Carol, that's so rude.
-Please, l'm serious.
-Okay.
Just for a moment, if you wouldn't mind.
And then we'll talk to Jerry.
Hey, you two, l'm ready to go.
That's what you had to tell me?
Your father wears sneakers in the pool?
Don't you find that strange?
Yes.
l'll just check my machine, and we'll go.
No.
Nothing here.
Let's go.
l forgot to tell you.
After l talked to you, my neighbour called, played my messages to me.
Yours were hilarious.
We were both cracking up.
l just love jokes like that.
l love my phone machine.
l wish l was a phone machine.
lf l saw somebody on the street l didn't want to talk to, l could go: '' Excuse me.
l'm not in right now.
lf you could just leave a message, l could walk away.
'' l also have a cordless phone, but l don't like that as much.
Because you can't slam down a cordless phone.
You get mad at somebody on a real phone: ''You can't talk to me like that.
'' Bang.
You know.
Cordless phone.
''You can't talk to me like that.
'' l told him.

{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Well, I painted my apartment again.
I've been living there for years.
Every time I paint it, it gets me down.
I look around and I think, "Well, it's a little bit smaller now".
It's the thickness of the paint, but I'm aware of it.
It just keeps coming in and coming in.
Every time I paint it, it's closer and closer.
I don't know where the wall outlets are.
I just look for a lump with two slots in it.
Looks like a pig is trying to push his way through from the other side.
That's where I plug in.
My idea of the perfect living room would be the bridge on the starship Enterprise.
You know what I mean?
Big chair, nice screen, remote control.
That's why Star Trek really was the ultimate male fantasy.
Just hurtling through space in your living room watching TV.
The aliens were always dropping in because Kirk was the only one that had the big screen.
They'd come over Friday nights.
Klingon boxing.
Got to be there.
- What did you do?
- Mousse.
I moussed up.
- I guess it was just a matter of time.
- I should've done this years ago.
I mean, I feel like I've had two lives.
My pre-mousse, and now I begin my post-mousse.
Tell me the truth, have you ever seen a better-looking guy?
Looks is so subjective.
I don't mean to interrupt or anything but on Sunday, my friend is having a brunch for the New York Marathon Oh, God I keep forgetting to enter that.
She lives right above First Avenue, has a perfect view of the race.
- She said I could invite some friends.
- Maybe.
No!
I'm not going up there!
Harold and Manny.
Boys, boys.
Oh, Jerry.
I slid the rent under your door, Harold.
Did you get it?
Hey, Jerry.
Would you like anything from Ms. Hudwalker's apartment?
I was only joking.
He thinks I'm gonna give you Ms. Hudwalker's things.
We have to go up now and clean the apartment.
It's a good thing her rent was overdue.
She'd be rotting there for a month.
She died?
Mrs. Hudwalker died?
Ninety-four years old.
I found her yesterday.
She didn't have her wig on.
It was horrifying.
What's the matter with you?
I'm talking!
So you know anybody who needs an apartment?
You know my friend Elaine?
Oh, yeah.
I like her.
She always says hello.
It's not promised to anyone?
She'd take it in a second.
Well, Manny wanted it for his brother, but he got deported.
- What's the difference?
It's true.
- So it's okay?
She can have it?
Sure.
She's getting a bargain too.
It's only $400 a month.
Okay.
- Okay.
- Hey, Harold.
What do you think?
Manny, look.
Kramer put mousse in his hair.
Thanks.
What was that all about?
Oh, nothing important.
What's going on?
What is that look?
What look?
Nothing.
Something's going on here.
I don't know if you should sit for this or not.
Sitting is good if you faint but standing is good for jumping up and down.
- I can't decide.
- Jumping up and down?
What are you talking about?
Come on, cough it up.
Oh, Elaine, you know the way I am rarely ever thinking of myself.
My only concern is the welfare and happiness of those close to me.
Sure, it hurts sometimes to give and give and give Would you please?
What would you say if I told you that?
Told me what?
I got you an apartment in this building.
- No!
- Yes.
- No!
You didn't!
- Yes.
I did.
You got me an apartment in the building?
I got you an apartment in the building.
- How did you?
- Remember Mrs. Hudwalker?
The 94-year-old woman who lived above me.
- No.
- She died.
- She died?
- She died.
- She died!
- Yeah.
- And the rent is only $400 a month.
- Get out!
Four hundred a month?
Only 400 a month?
- Four hundred a month.
- I'd be right upstairs?
- Right upstairs.
- Right above you?
Right above me.
We're neighbours.
I'll be here all the time!
All the time.
We can exchange keys so we can come in and out.
Oh, this is gonna be great.
All the time.
The problem with talking is nobody stops you from saying the wrong thing.
I think life would be a lot better if it was like you're always making a movie.
You mess up, somebody just walks on the set and stops the whole shot.
Think of the things you wish you could take back.
You're out somewhere with people.
"Gee, you look pregnant.
Are you"?
" Cut, cut, cut!
That's not gonna work at all.
Walk out the door.
Come back in.
Let's take this whole scene again.
People, think about what you're saying".
Thanks.
See you later, Donna.
- What happened?
- You can't believe what I did.
- What did you do?
- I could tell you but you won't believe it.
It's not believable.
- How could I have done that?
- Done what?
I told Elaine about an apartment opening up in my building.
- She's going to move in.
- Elaine's moving into your building?
- Yes.
Right above me.
- Right above you?
- You're gonna be neighbours.
- I know.
Neighbours.
- She's right above you?
- Right above me.
- How could you do that?
- Because I'm an idiot.
You think you're an idiot, but with all due respect l'm a much bigger idiot than you are.
Don't insult me, my friend.
Remember who you're talking to.
No one's a bigger idiot than me.
Ever ask an ex-girlfriend to move into your building?
Ever go to a singles' weekend in the Poconos?
She's right in my building.
Right above me.
Every time I come in, I'll have to sneak around like a cat burglar.
You're doomed.
You'll have all your sex at women's apartments.
It'll be a permanent road trip.
Forget about the home-bed advantage.
- But I need the home-bed advantage.
- Of course.
We all do.
- Come in for two minutes.
Sit with me.
- I was just in there.
It's embarrassing.
Oh, who's gonna know?
- They all saw me walk out.
- Two minutes.
My censoring system broke down.
You know that little guy in your head who watches everything you say?
He went for a cup of coffee.
And, in that second, ruined my life.
My censor quit two years ago.
Checked into a clinic, emotionally exhausted.
So is there any way out of this Elaine thing?
Tough.
Water pressure's terrible in my building.
She loves a good shower.
Never heard of anyone turning down an apartment because of weak showers.
If they were fanatic about showers, they might.
For that rent, she'd take a bath in the toilet tank if she had to.
Look at this woman feeding her baby greasy, disgusting, coffee-shop corned beef hash.
Isn't that child abuse?
I'd like to have a kid.
Of course, you have to have a date first.
Remember my friend Adam from Detroit?
- Yeah, the guy with the flat head.
- He's a cube.
Anyway, he got married about six months ago.
Ever since he's worn a wedding band women have been coming on to him everywhere.
- I've heard that about wedding bands.
- I wonder if that's really true.
That'd be an interesting sociological experiment.
You know, Kramer has his father's band.
He'd loan it to you.
Hey, thanks a lot.
I'll give it back in a week.
I don't know why you're fooling around with this ring.
I've been telling you, get yourself some plugs or a piece.
- I'm not doing that.
Oh, man.
You know, you're crazy.
You're a good-looking guy.
What do you want to walk around like that for?
No, I'll put a half a can of mousse in my head like you.
I told you I don't like these sponges.
They're too small.
I want a big sponge!
You can't pick up anything.
There's no absorption.
Boys, boys.
Hi, Jerry.
Hello, Jerry.
Okay.
Okay.
Your friend can't have the apartment, Jerry.
- What?
- Because somebody offered Manny $5000 for the apartment.
I don't want to do it.
Manny wants to do it.
Because it's true.
Why shouldn't I tell him?
Hey, hey, I understand.
You're businessmen.
Okay, okay.
Now he says that if your friend has $5000, we'll give it to her.
That's a lot of money but if that's the way it's gotta be, that's the way it's gotta be.
You know, I used to think that the universe is a random, chaotic sequence of meaningless events.
But I see now that there is reason and purpose to all things.
What happened to you?
Religion, my friend.
That's what happened to me.
Because I have just been informed that it's going to cost Elaine the sum of $5000 to get the apartment upstairs.
Five thousand dollars?
She doesn't have $5000.
- Of course she doesn't.
- So she can't get the apartment.
- Can't get it.
- She doesn't move in.
No move.
So you see?
It's all part of a divine plan.
And how does the baldness fit into that plan?
- Elaine?
- Yeah.
All right.
This is gonna require some great acting now.
I have to pretend I'm disappointed.
So you'll see me really being a phoney.
I hope you can take this.
You should go in the other room.
Are you kidding?
I lie every second of the day.
My whole life is a sham.
- Because I love Elaine.
- Of course you do.
But, you know, not in the building.
Really, I feel terrible about this.
My intentions were good.
What can I do?
Tell me.
No.
I'll be seeing you.
Have you ever gotten up in the morning and felt that it's great to be alive?
That every breath is a gift of sweet life from above.
Before I forget I have the checks for the first month, last month, security deposit.
I have $7 5 left in my account.
Well, there's a little bit of a problem.
Oh, I know.
There's a weak shower spray.
I've already thought about it.
I am switching to baths.
Winston Churchill said, "Why stand when you can sit"?
Maybe I'll get some rubber duckies.
No.
Someone offered Harold and Manny 5000 for the apartment.
They'd just as soon give it to you but you would have to come up with that money.
Five thousand dollars?
- I don't have $5000.
- I know.
How am I gonna get $5000?
I have no idea.
Hey!
My new neighbour.
I'm not moving in.
- What?
- They want $5000 now.
So okay, what's the problem?
I don't have $5000.
Oh, come on!
You can come up with $5000.
Jerry, you don't have $5000 you can lend her?
Come on.
Yeah, well, I didn't I mean Is that something you want to borrow?
No, that's too much money to borrow.
Loan her the money.
You can afford it.
She doesn't want to borrow the money.
Oh, come on.
She'll pay you back.
What's 5 grand between friends?
- Of course I'd pay you back.
- Yeah.
So, what's the problem?
- Who said there's a problem?
- See?
- He said he'd loan you the money.
- Well, now, Jerry it might take a while for me to pay you back.
Maybe a few years.
How do you feel about that?
It's okay.
He doesn't care.
You know, money can sometimes come between friends.
- Get out of here.
- Well, let me think about it.
- What's there to think about?
- I don't know.
Five thousand?
Let me just take one more look at it.
It was all over.
Taken care of.
Done.
Finished.
Five thousand.
Where was she gonna get 5000?
She doesn't have 5000.
Clean.
Goodbye.
She's gone.
Then you come in.
"Why don't you loan her 5000?
What do you care?
You got 5000.
Give her 5000"!
- You didn't want her in the building?
- No, I didn't.
Then what did you loan her the $5000 for?
Well, look, maybe she won't take it.
She did say that she was gonna think about it.
People don't turn down money.
It's what separates us from the animals.
Yeah, well, I don't understand what the problem is having her in the building.
Let me explain something to you.
You see you're not normal.
You're a great guy.
I love you, but you're a pod.
l, on the other hand, am a human being.
I sometimes feel awkward, uncomfortable even inhibited in certain situations with the other human beings.
- You wouldn't understand.
- Yeah.
Because I'm a pod.
I'll take it!
No.
- Hi, Elaine.
- Oh, hi, Roxanne.
Nice to be here.
These are my friends.
This is George.
- And this is Jerry.
- Hi.
Jerry's the one who got me my new apartment.
So you're Elaine's hero.
Yes, it's my life's work.
There are so few true heroes left in this world.
Yeah, my wife couldn't make it today.
She's got some thing with her mother.
Who knows what's going on with her?
Don't let anybody kid you.
It's tough.
Well, better load up on some carbos before the race.
- Oh, the marathon is great, isn't it?
- Oh, yes.
Particularly if you're not in it.
- I wish we had a view of the finish line.
- What's to see?
A woman from Norway, a guy from Kenya and 20,000 losers.
My wife started getting on me about the lawn today.
I tell you, it's one thing after another.
- Is she here?
- No, no, she's working.
What does she do?
She's an entomologist.
You know, bees, flies, gnats.
What about you?
I work for the director of Madison Square Garden.
It's great.
I can get free tickets to any sporting event in New York.
Anyway, she's a very lucky woman.
Enjoy the race.
But Hi, Stan.
Joanne.
Come in.
Oh, Jerry, this is Joanne and this is Stan.
They're in my short story class with Roxanne and me.
Hey, Jerry just got me a great apartment in his building.
Well, Jerry, it'll be nice to have a close friend nearby.
- Fantastic.
- She can pop in whenever she wants.
I know.
- She doesn't even need to knock.
- It's tremendous.
- Any time of day.
- I'm in heaven.
Oh, Rita.
Rita, come here.
This is Jerry.
He's the one who got me the apartment.
Oh, hi.
Bob, this is the guy who got Elaine her apartment.
I'm sorry, I just don't see the big deal about being a matador.
I mean, the bull charges, you move the cape what's so hard?
So are you really married?
I've actually heard of single guys who wear wedding bands to attract women.
You would have to be a real loser to try something like that.
That's too bad because I really have a thing for bald guys with glasses.
Hey, everybody, here come the runners.
Oh, excuse me.
So you and Roxanne are hitting it off, huh?
- I wouldn't quite say that.
- Really?
From a distance, you seemed to be coming on to her.
Oh, I'm a guy.
It always looks like that.
Because I was thinking are you at all concerned that living in the same building will, you know, cramp our styles?
Because I was worried that there might be a situation in which one of us came home with somebody.
It could get a little uncomfortable.
But as long as you're okay with it, it's fine with me.
I've never been able to be with just one person.
I can, however, carry on strictly physical relationships which can last for years and years.
It's a shame you're married.
I'm not.
- It's just a sociological experiment.
- Please.
You have no idea what an idiot is.
Elaine just gave me a chance to get out, and I didn't take it.
This is an idiot.
Is that right?
I just threw away a lifetime of guilt-free sex and floor seats for every sporting event in Madison Square Garden.
So, please, a little respect.
For I am Costanza, lord of the idiots.
You're all winners!
But, suddenly, a new contender has emerged.
George, I didn't sleep at all last night.
I decided I have to tell her.
I'm just gonna be honest, that's all.
Yes, I'm nervous.
Are you listening to me?
Just put some soap on your finger.
It'll slide right off.
Well, then try axle grease.
I'll call you back after I talk to her.
Well it's all taken care of.
Everything's cool.
- What?
What's cool?
- Elaine.
What are you talking about?
I just found a guy who's willing to pay $1 0,000 for the apartment.
You what?
Get out!
- Ten thousand?
- Cash!
- Who would pay that much?
- He's in the music business.
Elaine would never borrow that much money.
Kramer, my God, man.
This is beautiful.
I think I'm in the clear here.
Elaine's not moving in.
I don't have to confront her.
She has no idea I never wanted her to move in.
I'm golden.
Well, occasionally, I like to help the humans.
- Wow, you're right, that is loud.
- It's just unbelievable.
- They rehearse all the time?
- All the time.
I've been up there six times.
They refuse to stop.
I can't live like this.
I don't know what to do.
I'm headed for a breakdown.
- Can't you do something?
- I'm not going up.
- It stinks up there.
- Manny?
I'm not the one who said they could play till 1 1:00.
He makes up his own rules.
Boy, too bad.
If I was up there, you'd never hear a peep out of me.
- I'm as quiet as a mouse.
- Hey.
I love the one they do right after this one.
What do you do when a neighbour is making a lot of noise at 3:00 in the morning?
Can you knock on someone's door and tell them to keep it down?
You're really altering your whole self-image.
What am l, Fred Mertz now?
What's happening to me?
Can I do this?
Am I a shusher?
I used to be a shushee.
There's a lot of shushing in movie theatres.
People are always shushing.
Doesn't work.
Nobody knows where it's coming from.
They just hear"Was that a shush?
I think somebody shushed me"?
Some people you can't shush.
There's always a certain group.
They're talking.
Everyone around them is shushing them.
They won't shush.
They're the unshushables.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
I have to tell you that I did get some very exciting news recently.
I don't know if I should tell you what it is, because it's not definite yet.
- Come on!
- Come on!
Well, I will tell you what I do know so far.
According to the information that I have in the envelope that I received it seems that I may have already won some very valuable prizes.
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much.
Well, thank you.
It's very nice to hear that.
But in all honesty I have to say, I didn't even know I was in this thing.
But according to the readout it looks like I am among the top people that they are considering.
That annoys me about sweepstakes.
They tease you with, "You may have already won".
I'd like once for a sweepstakes company to have some guts.
Just tell people the truth one time.
Send out envelopes: "You have definitely lost".
You turn it over, giant printing: " Not even close".
You open it, there's a letter of explanation: " Even we cannot believe how badly you've done in this contest".
To the right.
Boy, that took a while.
- Don't get up.
- I'd like to help, but my neck So how long has it been in the basement?
Since my grandfather died.
I was supposed to send it to my parents, but they didn't want it.
They said get rid of it, but I felt funny.
And then I forgot about it.
It's been sitting there for three years until he saw it.
All right, so just take what you want, and let's get it out of here.
What's in it?
Grandpa clothes.
I can't wear them.
You want these?
Knee socks.
You don't wear knee socks.
No.
Go ahead.
Look at this place.
I can't wait to get it cleaned.
I know somebody who'll do it.
She's good, she's honest No, Elaine's got this writer friend from Finland.
Rava.
Her boyfriend goes to Columbia grad school.
And he's supposed to do it.
Students can't clean.
It's anathema.
They don't like it.
How long you been waiting to squeeze that into a conversation?
Now, this, I like.
Wait a second.
I can't believe this.
- Let me see this.
- Wait, wait.
- Let me just see it for a second.
- No.
Come on, come on.
- Oh, my God.
It's exactly the same.
- What?
When I was 1 0 years old, my parents had this very same statue on the mantel of our apartment.
Exactly.
And one day I grabbed it, I was using it as a microphone.
I was singing " MacArthur Park".
And I got to the part about, " I'll never have the recipe again" and it slipped out my hand, and it broke.
My parents looked at me like I smashed the Ten Commandments.
To this day, they bring it up.
It was the single most damaging experience of my life.
Aside from seeing my father naked.
- Come on, I saw it first.
- Kramer, I have to have the statue.
- I got dibs.
- No dibs.
I need the statue.
Give it!
Spread out.
You numbskulls.
Why don't you just settle it like mature adults?
- Potato man.
- No, no.
No potato man.
Inka-dink.
Okay.
- Yeah, start with me.
- Yeah.
Good, good.
Inka-dink, a bottle of ink The cork fell out, and you stink Not because you're dirty Not because you're clean Just because you kissed a girl Behind the magazine - And you are - Wait a minute.
No.
it - What?
What are you doing?
No, no.
Oh, okay.
All right.
He's out, I get it.
- No, no, no.
I'm it.
I win.
- No.
He's it.
He wins.
It is good.
Do over.
Start with him.
No, no.
Come on, Kramer.
Now, you got the socks.
All right, you can have it.
Okay.
I'm gonna take the suit and shoes and the hat.
- All right.
Let's go.
Hey, I look like Joe Friday in Dragnet.
I can't believe I won at inka-dink.
- Come on, let's go.
- Yeah.
- Aren't you gonna take it?
- I don't wanna carry it around.
I'll pick it up later.
What about your stuff?
Okay.
All right, let's go.
Hey You know, you owe me one.
- What?
- The inka-dink.
You were it.
- It's bad?
- It's very bad.
If they don't let you be my editor on this I go to another publisher.
It's that simple.
- You told them that?
- Of course.
Oh, this is so fantastic.
I don't know how to thank you.
Where's this boyfriend of yours?
I can't wait much longer, I got a flight.
He's probably caught in traffic.
Or maybe he's dead.
So, what do you write, children's books?
That's Ray.
Greetings.
Greetings and salutations.
I beg your forgiveness.
My tardiness was unavoidable.
Rava, my love.
Elaine, dear friend.
And you must be Jerry, lord of the manor.
My liege.
A pleasure to serve you.
All right.
Well, we have to get back to work.
I gotta get to the airport.
Your palace shall sparkle like the stars in heaven upon your safe arrival, sire.
The toilet brush is under the sink.
I don't feel comfortable with a maid either.
There's that guilt when someone's cleaning your house.
You're sitting on the sofa, they go by with the vacuum.
" I'm really sorry about this.
I don't know why I left that stuff over there".
That's why I could never be a maid.
I would have that attitude.
I'd find them, wherever they are.
" I suppose you couldn't do this.
No, don't get up.
Let me clean up your filth.
No, you couldn't dust.
Oh, this is too tough, isn't it"?
He really did an amazing job.
Look.
He uncoagulated the top of the dishwashing liquid.
He cleaned out the bottom of the little egg cups.
Come here, look at this.
He cleaned in the little one-inch area between the refrigerator and the counter.
How'd he get in there?
He must be like Rubber Man.
There's no Rubber Man.
Why did I think there was a Rubber Man?
There's Elastic Man, Plastic Man - I'm leaving.
- Where are you going?
To Rava's.
I gotta pick up her manuscript.
- Oh, wait, I'll go with you.
- Okay.
Elaine, he Windexed the little peephole.
So the meeting with Lippman is all set.
He's the editor in chief.
- I think because of your request.
- Demand.
They're gonna promote me to editor.
Darn tooting.
There's Ray, late as usual.
Well.
This is an unexpected surprise.
And delight.
The once and future king of comedy, Jerry the first gracing our humble abode.
Rava, we are in the presence of royalty.
Hey, Ray, listen.
You really did a tremendous job cleaning that apartment.
But I didn't just clean your apartment.
It was a ritual, a ceremony.
A celebration of life.
Shouldn't you be out on a ledge somewhere?
He's funny.
- Water's boiling.
Are we having tea?
- Yes.
Yes.
Jerry?
- Jerry.
- What?
Ray, would you give me a hand, please?
Yeah, I'm coming.
I think that's the statue from my house.
That looks like the statue from my house.
- What statue?
- I had a statue.
You do?
I never saw a statue.
My grandfather gave me a statue.
- Since when?
- What's the difference?
That's the one.
He ripped me off.
This guy ripped me off.
Do you take sugar?
- No.
- No.
I can't believe it.
This guy ripped me off.
- Do you realize what you're saying?
- Yes, this guy ripped me off.
He stole that statue right out of my house.
Lemon?
- Sure.
- Yeah.
- Are you sure?
- Pretty sure.
- 99-percent sure.
- 99-percent sure?
Sweet elixir, its fragrant nectar a soothing balm for the soul.
Those are the pastries.
Take care of that.
I'm gonna get Elaine the manuscript.
The pastries.
Maybe it just looks the same.
It's a coincidence.
Coincidence?
This guy's in my apartment, and by coincidence he has the exact same statue in his apartment?
- I never saw any statue.
- I had a statue.
What should I do?
I'll call Kramer.
He can check my house.
Oh, Jerry.
- Don't blow this for me.
- Don't worry.
Kramer.
It's Jerry.
Jerry.
From next door.
Never mind where I am.
Yes, Jerry Seinfeld.
Ma, I told you just dip the bread in the batter and put it in the pan.
Okay, bye.
My mother.
She forgot how to make French toast.
You know how mothers are.
My mother left us when I was 6 years old.
All seven of us.
We never heard from her again.
I hope she's rotting in an alley somewhere.
My mom's down in Florida.
She's got one of those condos.
Hot down there in the summer.
You ever been down there?
I love these pastries.
In Scandinavian mythology, the pastries were the food of the gods.
Listen, I just remembered, I'm getting a facial.
Oh, I'll see you tomorrow morning.
- How about dinner?
- No, I don't eat dinner.
Dinner's for suckers.
Yeah, okay.
Thanks anyway.
Bye.
Nope.
Cop says it's my word against his.
There's nothing they can do.
Let's go get him.
- Yeah, right.
- We can't let him get away with this.
You realize how crazy he had to be to do this?
He knew I was gonna know it's missing and that he took it.
And of all things to take.
I left my watch, tape recorder, stereo.
He's crazy.
You wanna go get him?
If he's crazy, you should just forget it.
Forget it?
I already called my parents.
I told them to expect the surprise of a lifetime.
My mother's making her roasted potatoes.
George, do you realize that Rava has asked me to edit her book?
Who is this Rava?
I say we get him.
- Let me just call him.
- I'll call him.
Hello, Ray?
Hi, Ray.
This is Rava's friend, Elaine's friend, Jerry.
Yeah, the king of comedy, right.
Listen, you know that statue on your mantel the one with?
The blue lady?
Would you shut up?
!
Yeah.
Oh, you don't want to talk about it over the phone.
You don't want Rava to hear.
Yeah, I understand.
You know the coffee shop near my house, Monk's?
All right, tomorrow, 1:00.
Great.
Okay, bye.
All right, look.
Look, look.
- Let's say he stole it.
- Oh, he stole it.
You can't do anything about it.
The cops won't do anything.
What, are you gonna go fight him?
Why don't you just forget it.
- No.
- No.
Thought you said 1:00.
Relax.
He's late.
He's always late.
It's part of his m.o. Remember, don't take any crap.
Yeah, yeah.
Don't worry about it.
- I'll be right here.
- That's comforting.
He's coming.
Ray.
Jerry.
I can't believe you asked me about that statue.
You know how much trouble you could've gotten me in?
- Well, l - Rava was standing right next to me.
I never told her where I got the statue.
- I wonder why.
- Well, just give it back and I won't say anything.
- Give it back?
- Yeah.
- What are you talking about?
- What's he talking about?
- I'm talking about the statue.
- Yeah, me too.
- Give it back to whom?
- Me.
- You?
- Yeah, me.
- I'm not getting this.
- You already got it.
Ray, I had a statue in my house.
You were in my house.
And then I saw it in your house.
- What are you saying?
- What am I saying?
Take a wild guess.
Are you saying I stole your statue?
- What a mind.
- Well, l - I can't believe what I'm hearing.
- I can't believe what I'm hearing.
For your information, I got that statue in a pawnshop.
- Pawnshop?
- A pawnshop?
In Chinatown, with money I earned cleaning apartments.
- Cleaning them out.
- Oh, excuse me.
Yeah.
Look, Ray, you were the only person in my house.
What's behind this?
It's Rava, isn't it?
Again with the Rava.
- You want her.
- No, she's a little too cheery for me.
She's from Finland, for crying out loud.
Finland!
Do you understand?
I know Finland.
They're neutral.
Is it me?
Do I rub you the wrong way?
No, actually, I find you quite charming.
A bit verbose at times.
" I find you so charming".
You wuss.
- Did you call me a wuss?
- What did you say?
I said, " luss".
I'm at a " luss".
I'd love to take you to the pawnshop where I got it.
That's not necessary.
You know, maybe it's not that bad an idea.
And I would love to.
Nothing would please me more.
But unfortunately, the guy retired and moved to Singapore.
Singapore?
Do you hear this?
If you really want, maybe I can contact the guy in Singapore.
Have him make a Photostat of the receipt and send it over.
- That's it.
That's it!
I can't take it.
I can't take it anymore!
You stole the statue!
You're a thief!
You're a liar!
- George.
- Who is this?
I'm the judge and the jury, pal.
And the verdict is, guilty!
- What is going on here?
- Guilty!
- Your friend is crazy.
- Oh, I'm crazy!
- George, George.
- I've gotta get going.
I have a class.
Oh, a class, huh?
A class.
At Columbia?
Let me tell you something.
I called the registrar's office.
I checked you out.
They have no record of a Ray Thomas at that school, you liar!
That is because I am registered under my full legal name Raymond Thomas Wochinski.
Ray Thomas is my professional name.
You mean "alias".
You are starting to make me angry.
Well that was bound to happen.
I hope you think about what you've done here today.
And if you wanna call and apologize you know where to reach me.
- Hey, Ray.
- Yes?
How did you get the goop out of the top of the dishwashing liquid?
It was like a brand-new nozzle.
- Nervous?
- Why should I be?
Yeah.
Right.
Your notes were very insightful.
The book is great.
Did you go out last night?
No, we made love on the floor like two animals.
Ray is insatiable.
They all are.
Was Jerry?
I can't remember.
You know, Ray is very upset over these accusations.
I'm staying out of this one.
This is between them.
I am not getting involved.
So you think he stole it?
You have to admit, the circumstantial evidence I admit nothing.
Will you put that cigarette out, please?
I mean, he was in the apartment and then it's gone, and it's in your apartment.
- Maybe you think we're in cahoots.
- No.
But it's quite a coincidence.
Yes, that's all, a coincidence.
Big coincidence.
Not a big coincidence.
A coincidence.
No, that's a big coincidence.
That's what a coincidence is.
There are no small coincidences and big coincidences.
No.
There are degrees of coincidences.
No.
There are only coincidences.
Ask anyone.
Are there big coincidences and small coincidences or just coincidences?
Well?
Will you put that cigarette out?
Maybe I put it out on your face.
It's just like Ray said.
You and Jerry, you're jealous of our love.
You're trying to destroy us.
Shouldn't you be out on a ledge somewhere?
Ma, will you stop?
It's just a statue.
How is it my fault?
It was stolen.
I didn't even touch it this time.
Okay, fine.
I don't see why this should affect the potatoes.
Okay!
Goodbye.
She doesn't react to disappointment very well.
Unlike me.
I'm not happy about this.
Why don't we just throw a Molotov cocktail through their window.
There's just no justice.
This experience has changed me.
It's made me more cynical, more bitter, more jaded.
- Really?
- Sure.
Why not?
How do you think I feel?
Instead of editing the first novel of a major young writing talent I am proofreading a food-allergy cookbook.
- Can't you talk to your boss?
- I did.
He loves Rava.
Worse, he loves Ray.
And he doesn't think you're funny at all.
I'm not happy about this.
Perhaps we can take comfort in the knowledge that in the next world, Ray will be the recipient of a much larger and more harsh brand of justice.
Yeah, he'll have my parents.
Police.
Open up!
Police?
- Freeze, mama!
- Hey, hey Shut up!
Spread them.
I said, spread them!
You're in big trouble, son.
Burglary, grand larceny possession of stolen goods.
- And murder!
- Murder?
Shut up!
Keep them spread.
You just make love to that wall, pervert.
Hey, I think you have me confused with somebody else.
- Is your name Ray?
- Yeah.
Yeah, you're the punk I'm looking for!
Hey.
Hey, are you a cop?
Yeah, I'm a cop.
I'm a good cop.
I'm a damn good cop!
And today's your lucky day, junior.
Because I'm gonna let you off with just a warning.
Any more of this criminal activity, and you'll be sorry.
You got me?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Good, good.
Let's keep it that way.
All right, all right.
What's the big hubbub, bub?
Kramer, I can't believe it.
- Oh, you're my hero!
- Yeah.
- Kramer, what did you do?
- Well, let's put it this way: I didn't take him to People's Court.
I feel like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders.
l I feel happy!
Kramer, I don't know how to thank you.
Well, I'll think of something.
People are going to steal from you.
You can't stop them.
But everybody has their own little personal security things.
Things that they think will foil the crooks, you know, in your mind.
You go to the beach, go in the water.
Put your wallet in the sneaker.
Who's gonna know?
What criminal mind could penetrate this fortress of security?
" I tied a bow.
They can't get through that".
" I put the wallet down by the toe of the sneaker.
They never look there.
They check the heel, they move on".
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Whenever I see the news and they're hauling in some criminal, terrorist, psycho, maniac, mass-murderer guy You notice he's always covering up his face?
What is he worried about?
I mean, what is this man's reputation that he has to worry about this kind of exposure damaging his good name?
I mean, what is he, up for a big job promotion down at the office or something?
Afraid the boss is gonna catch this on TV and go: " Isn't that Johnson from sales?
He's up in that clock tower, picking people off one by one.
I don't know if that's the kind of man we want heading up that new branch office.
He should be in bill collection.
I think he's got aptitude".
She was great.
You don't want to know.
Hey, Brecky, remind me to tell you what we did in Lake George.
Get this, I got it all on video.
That's it.
This is it.
I'm done!
Through!
It's over!
I'm gone!
Finished!
Over!
I will never work for you again!
Look at you.
You think you're an important man?
You are a laughingstock.
You are a joke.
These people are laughing at you!
You're nothing!
You have no brains, no ability, nothing!
I quit!
- Hey.
- Hey.
Boy, I have really had it with Newman.
He wakes me up again, last night, at 3:00 in the morning to tell me he's going on the roof to kill himself.
- Well, what did you say?
- I said, "Jump".
He's been threatening to do this for years.
I said, " If you're gonna kill yourself, do it already and stop bothering me".
At least I'd respect the guy for accomplishing something.
What's his problem?
No job, no women.
He called the right guy.
What am I supposed to tell him?
How much there is for him to live for?
Why should I lie to him?
I'm leaving.
I'm going to the laundry.
Why don't you use the machines down in the basement?
Fluff and fold, the only way to live.
I drop it off, I pick it up.
It's a delight.
- How about if I put a?
- I don't want to do that.
- What, you're going over there, what?
- I don't want to mix in everything.
My guys don't know your guys.
You can't just lock them all in the same machine together.
They'll start a riot.
Have you ever met my guys?
- No, I can't say as I have.
- Well All right, put them on top.
Oh, beautiful.
This stuff on top is my friend's.
Could I get it done in a separate machine?
I'll have to charge you for another machine.
Whatever it costs.
In fact I would prefer it if the machines are not even touching each other because something could, you know, jump across.
Guess what.
- How did you know I was here?
- Kramer.
Guess what.
- I don't know.
- I quit my job.
- Get out of here.
- I couldn't take it anymore.
You can have this on Monday.
What happened?
Levitan?
I go in to use his private bathroom.
Everybody uses it.
And then I get a memo A memo telling me to use the men's room in the hall.
I mean, we share it with Pace Electronics.
It's disgusting!
You and your toilets.
I snapped.
It was the last straw.
What are you gonna do?
Look for something else in real estate?
Nobody's hiring now.
The market's terrible.
So, what are you gonna do?
I like sports.
I could do something in sports.
In what capacity?
You know, like the general manager of a baseball team.
Yeah, well, that That can be tough to get.
Well, it doesn't even have to be the general manager.
Maybe I could be, like, an announcer, like, a colour man.
You know how I always make interesting comments during the game?
Yeah.
Yeah, you make good comments.
So, what about that?
Well, they tend to give those jobs to ex-ballplayers and people that are, you know, in broadcasting.
- Well, that's really not fair.
- I know.
Well, okay, okay.
What else do you like?
Movies.
I like to watch movies.
Yeah, yeah.
Do they pay people to watch movies?
Projectionists.
- That's true.
- But you got to know how to work the projector.
Right.
And it's probably a union thing.
Those unions.
Okay, sports movies What about a talk show host?
Talk show host, that's good.
I think I'd be good at that.
I talk to people all the time.
Someone said once I'd be a good talk show host.
- Really?
- Yeah, a couple of people.
How do you get that?
Where do you start?
Well, that's where it gets tricky.
You can't walk into a building and say, " I want to be a talk show host".
I wouldn't think so.
It's all politics.
All right, okay, sports, movies, talk show host What else?
This could have been a huge mistake.
Yeah, well, it doesn't sound like you completely thought this through.
I guess not.
- What should I do?
- Maybe you can just go back.
- Go back?
- Yeah.
Pretend like it never happened.
You mean just walk in on Monday morning like it never happened?
Sure.
You're an emotional person.
People don't take you seriously.
Just go back.
- Pretend it never happened.
- Never happened.
I was blowing off a little steam.
So what?
- So what?
You're entitled.
- I'm emotional.
That's right, you're emotional.
- Never happened.
- Never happened.
To me, the most annoying thing about the couple of times I did work in an office is when you go in in the morning, you say " hi" to everyone and then, throughout the day you have to continue to greet these people all day, every time you see them.
" Morning, Bill".
" Morning, Bob".
" How you doing"?
" Fine".
Ten minutes later, you see them in the hall, " How you doing"?
Every time you pass, you've gotta come up with another greeting.
You start racking your brains.
You do the little eyebrow, you know, " Hey".
You start coming up with nicknames for them.
"Jimbo".
How you doing?
What are you doing here?
What?
I work here.
I thought you quit.
What quit?
Who quit?
Bill, how was your weekend?
Excellent weekend.
What about your weekend?
- Fine weekend.
- Yeah, good weekend.
Went up to the Cape.
Took the kids sailing.
Lisa was a little scared at first but that kid's gonna be a good sailor someday.
She's gonna be a fine sailor.
Ava, what happened to you Friday afternoon?
- I got tied up.
- I'll bet you did.
I want to remind everyone that the 1 0th anniversary party for Rick Barr Properties is gonna be Wednesday afternoon at 4:00 in Lasky's Bar on Madison and 48th.
I want all of you to be there.
This really means a lot to me.
Is that Costanza over there?
What are you doing here?
- What?
- Am I crazy or didn't you quit?
- When?
- Friday.
Oh, what?
That?
Are you kidding?
I didn't quit.
Why, you took that seriously?
You mean " laughingstock," all that stuff.
Come on.
Will you stop it?
- " No brains, no ability"?
- Teasing.
Okay, I want you out of here.
I don't know where you're getting this from.
You're serious, aren't you?
Oh, you see you just don't know my sense of humour.
I mean, Dan, don't I joke around all the time?
I wouldn't say all the time.
You can't win.
You can't beat me.
That's why I'm here, and you're there.
Because I'm a winner.
I'll always be a winner and you'll always be a loser.
" I'll always be a winner, and you'll always be a loser".
This is what he said to me.
- Well, so that's that.
- No, that's not that.
- That's not that?
- No.
Well, if that's not that, what is that?
I got some plans.
I got plans.
- What kind of plans?
- What's the difference?
You don't wanna tell me?
I'm gonna slip him a Mickey.
What, in his drink?
Are you out of your mind?
What are you, Peter Lorre?
You don't understand.
He's got this big party coming up.
He's been looking forward to this.
This is gonna destroy the whole thing.
- What if you destroy him?
- No, no, no.
Don't worry.
It's perfectly safe.
I researched it.
He'll get a little woozy.
He might keel over.
- Well, what does that do?
Big deal.
- This is what they'd do in the movies.
It's the beautiful thing.
It's like a movie.
I'm gonna slip him a Mickey.
You've really gone mental.
Where are you gonna get this Mickey?
I can't believe I'm saying " Mickey".
I got a source.
You got a Mickey source?
And Elaine is gonna keep him busy.
Elaine?
How did you rope her into this?
I told her what a sexist he is.
How he cheats on his wife.
- She knew that.
- She didn't know he doesn't recycle.
What is the point of all this?
- Revenge.
- The best revenge is living well.
There's no chance of that.
- Did you get your laundry?
- Yeah.
What's with you?
He jumped.
- What?
- Newman jumped.
- Did he call you last night?
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
What did you say?
I said, "Wave to me when you pass my window".
Did he wave?
No.
He jumped from the second floor.
Mr. Papanicolas saw him from across the street.
He's lying out there faking.
See, he's trying to get back at me.
- Oh, my God.
- What?
What's the matter?
On Thursday when I came home, I had 1 500 dollars on me.
For some reason, I decided to hide it in my laundry bag and then I completely forgot about it.
And then I took the laundry in on Friday!
- Oh, come on, let's go.
- Where?
Where?
To the Laundromat.
I never saw it.
Okay, come on, give the guy his money.
What are you doing?
Hey, you see that sign up there?
I see.
You put up a sign so you can do whatever you want.
You're not a part of society.
Yeah, that's right.
Because this place is my country and I'm the president, and that's my Constitution.
I'm not responsible.
So anybody leaves anything here, you could just take it.
You have a license to steal.
You are like the James Bond of laundry.
- You ever hear of a bank?
- Come on, let's go.
No, you can't let him get away with this.
- Which one is he?
- That's him over there.
The one that looks like a blowfish.
- Oh, yeah.
I see him.
- Yeah.
Hey, thanks for doing this.
Why pass up the opportunity to go to prison?
This is the most exciting thing I've ever done.
Yeah, it is kind of cool.
First time in my life I've ever gotten back at someone.
I can't believe we're doing this.
It's the kind of thing they do in the movies.
That's exactly what I told Jerry.
- Really?
- Yes.
God, I've never felt so alive.
Maybe we should call this off.
Come on, what's the big deal?
We're just gonna put a little concrete in the washing machine.
- And what's gonna happen?
- Well, it'll mix up with the water and then, by the end of the cycle, it'll be a solid block.
If only you could put your mind to something worthwhile.
You're like Lex Luthor.
You keep him busy.
You go over there, you start flirting with him and I'll come by, and while you're keeping him busy l'll slip it in his drink.
Wouldn't it be easier just to punch him in the mouth?
Come on.
They're terrible.
They got no infield.
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.
I'm gonna get some food.
You want some?
No.
Hi.
Hi.
God bless you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Really, I mean that.
I am not one of those people who gives insincere thank-yous.
No, sir.
No, sir.
When I thank somebody, I really thank them.
So thank you.
- You're welcome.
- People don't say "God bless you" as much as they used to.
Have you noticed that?
No.
So I'm going to a nudist colony next week.
Nudist colony?
Really?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I love nudist colonies.
They help me unwind.
I've never been to a nudist colony.
Oh, really?
Oh, you should go.
They're great.
They're great.
Of course, when it's over, it's hard to get used to all this clothing, you know.
So a lot of times I'll just lock the door to my office and I'll just sit there naked.
- Seriously?
- Oh, yeah.
I usually work naked a couple hours a day.
Glenda, can I ask you a favour?
Could I have this seat?
What do you have to sit here for?
There are plenty of other seats.
I can't explain.
It's very important that I sit here.
What are you doing here anyway?
I thought you were fired.
Okay, okay.
Fine.
I cook naked, I clean I clean naked.
I drive naked.
Naked, naked, naked.
Who are you?
Oh, you don't want to know, mister.
I'm trouble.
Big trouble.
What about the gentle cycle?
You ever use that?
Do you think it's effeminate for a man to put clothes in a gentle cycle?
What about fine fabrics?
How do you deal with that kind of temperament?
What about stonewashing?
You ever witness one of those?
That must be something.
What, do they just pummel the jeans with rocks?
I didn't realize it was a full box.
I'm gonna count to three.
If you don't give up the chair the wig is coming off.
I don't wear a wig.
One No, I'm sorry.
I don't really have a phone.
In fact, I don't really have an apartment.
I kind of sleep around.
I just like to have a few drinks and then just let the guy do whatever he wants.
Would you close your eyes a second?
I want to tell you a secret about my bra.
Hello, Rick.
Hey, look who's here.
That's right, Ricky boy, it's me.
You know something, Costanza, I'm a very lucky man.
I've always been lucky.
Things just to seem to fall right in my lap.
You wouldn't believe it if I told you.
In fact, I'm glad you're here, you know.
Maybe I've been a little rough on you.
Why should we let personal differences get in the way of business?
I I want you to come back.
And you can use my bathroom anytime you want.
- You want me to come back?
- Yeah.
Hey, how about a toast, huh?
- Everybody, a toast!
- Rick.
Everyone, I want to propose a toast to 1 0 great years at Rick Barr Properties - Rick.
and all the people in this room that made that possible.
- Rick.
I'd also like to welcome back into the fold our little, shrimpy friend, George Costanza who, although he really didn't have a very good year How you blew that McConnell deal, I'll never know but, hey, what the hell, huh?
We've always enjoyed his antics around the office.
Anything you want to add to this?
Drink up!
I like history, the Civil War.
Maybe I could be a professor or something.
Well, to teach something, you really have to know a lot about it.
- I think you need a degree.
- Yeah, that's true.
- Hey, don't - What?
Oh, my God, the money.
- The 1 500, where'd you find it?
- It was in my laundry.
In your laundry?
The whole time?
I told you not to mix in our guys.
What did we figure the damage on that machine would be?
It was about 1 200 bucks.
Kramer!
That's Newman.
I'm on the roof!
Well?
What are you waiting for?
Elaine, take a walk with me to the Laundromat.
I got to pay this guy the money.
I like horses.
Maybe I could be a stable boy.
You want to shoot some pool tonight?
I can't.
I'm going to a movie!
Nah, it's probably a union thing.
People like the idea of revenge.
You ever hear the expression: "The best revenge is living well"?
I've said this.
In other words, it means, supposedly the best way to get back at someone is by being happy and successful in your own life.
Sounds nice.
Doesn't really work on that Charles Bronson kind of level.
You know, those movies where his whole family gets wiped out by some street scum.
You think you could go up to him: " Charlie, forget the.
357.
You need a custom-made suit and a convertible new carpeting, French doors, a divan.
That'll show those punks".
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
You know, I gotta say that I'm enjoying adulthood for a lot of reasons.
I'll tell you reason number one: As an adult, if I want a cookie, I have a cookie, okay?
I have three cookies or four cookies or 1 1 cookies if I want.
Many times, I will intentionally ruin my entire appetite.
Just ruin it.
And then I call my mother up right after to tell her that I did it.
" Hello, Mom?
Yeah, I just ruined my entire appetite.
Cookies".
So what if you ruin it?
As an adult, we understand even if you ruin an appetite there's another appetite coming right behind it.
There's no danger in running out of appetites.
I've got millions of them.
I ruin them whenever I want.
Look, Zigmond.
Look at the sky!
The planet's on fire!
It is just as you prophesised!
The planets of our solar system incinerating lik e flaming globes, Zigmond, lik e flaming globes!
Zigmond - Coffee.
- Thank you.
What do you got, a cucumber?
Yeah.
So what?
You're bringing in an outside cucumber?
They refuse to put cucumber in the salad.
I need cucumber.
What have I done?
What?
I can't read this.
" Fullman hurtel vom"?
I got up last night, I wrote this down.
I thought I had this great bit.
Wait a second.
" Fax me some halibut".
Is that funny?
Is that a joke?
No.
Let me see that.
" Don't mess with Johnny".
Johnny?
Johnny who?
Johnny Carson?
Did I insult Johnny on The Tonight Show?
Did you mess with Johnny, Jerry?
Let me see that.
- Hey, where's Kramer?
- I don't know.
That's like asking, "Where's Waldo"?
I think I'm having a heart attack.
I don't think that's it.
- I'm not kidding.
- What does that mean?
I think what he's trying to say is that he's having a heart attack.
Oh, he's having a heart attack.
- Tightness.
- Come on.
- Shortness of breath.
- This is ridiculous.
- Radiating waves of pain.
- I know what this is!
You saw that show on PBS last night, Coronary Country.
I saw it in the TV Guide, I called him told him make sure and not watch it.
There was nothing else on.
- Here, have some water.
- Oh, the left arm, left arm.
He saw that show on anorexia last year ate like an animal for two weeks.
Why can't I have a heart attack?
!
I'm allowed.
You want me to take you to the hospital?
Manhattan Memorial.
Less of a line.
I'll call an ambulance.
Is everything all right?
We'll just take a check.
You made a mistake on the George.
Are you okay?
I'm George.
George Costanza.
I never been in the hospital a day in my life except when I had my tonsils out.
You know, they never gave me any ice cream.
- I always felt that if they - Shut up!
- Well, what do you think?
- "Salami salami bologna".
Definitely.
"Salami salami bologna"?
Oh, your friend's fine.
He didn't have a heart attack.
I'll be in in a few minutes.
What a surprise.
Hey.
How you doing, buddy?
You need anything?
You want me to go out, get you a Superman comic?
No.
No, thanks.
You know, I was wondering you know that Blackhawks jacket you have?
Oh, sure, my Blackhawks jacket.
I love my Blackhawks jacket.
Well, you know, I was thinking, if things don't exactly work out Well, it wouldn't fit you.
The sleeves are too short.
No, I tried it on.
It fits good.
I didn't think about what I was gonna do with all the things - Well, you know Well - Well, okay.
- Oh, and do you think it'd be all right if I called Susan Davis?
Susan Davis?
!
Hey, wait a second!
Well, it's not like we'll be bumping into you.
I don't know.
You and Susan Davis?
You know if your future was more certain Okay.
Go ahead.
Call her.
Get married.
Have babies.
Have a great life.
What do I care?
I'm finished.
It's all over for me.
In fact let's end it right now.
Jerry kill me.
Kill me now.
I'm begging you.
Let's just get it over with.
Be a pal.
Just take the pillow and put it over my face.
Well - What, kind of like this?
- What?
What are you?
Jerry!
Hey!
Jerry!
Elaine.
What are you doing here?
Jerk-off.
There's nothing wrong with him.
I saw the doctor.
He's fine.
Hi, George.
How you feeling?
Is anybody getting your apartment?
I'll tell you, if I ever get out of here l'm gonna change my life.
I'm gonna do a whole Zen thing.
Take up yoga.
Meditate.
I'll eat right.
Calm down, you know?
Lose my anger.
Hey, is anybody listening?
!
Hello.
Mr. Costanza.
Excuse me.
Yeah, you know, doc, I gotta tell you, I feel a lot better.
Well, we looked at your EKGs, ran some tests, did a complete workup.
Oh, God.
Mommy.
Well, you simply haven't had a heart attack.
I haven't?
I'm okay?
I'm okay?
Oh, thank you!
Thank you!
I don't know how to thank you!
Hey, that was really fun, George.
Can we go home now?
No, we'd like to keep him overnight for observation, just to be safe.
Oh, sure, sure, anything.
Can you believe it?
Nothing's wrong with me.
Well, I wouldn't go that far.
What?
Oh, my God.
What?
Is it meningitis?
Scoliosis?
Lupus?
Is it lupus?
!
Have you ever had your tonsils taken out?
My tonsils?
Yeah, when I was a kid.
Well, they've grown back.
And your adenoids are swollen too.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Oh, whose tonsils grow back?
- It happens.
Yeah, if you've been exposed to gamma rays.
I still have my tonsils.
Everyone in my family has theirs.
In fact, we were forbidden to socialize with anybody who didn't have their tonsils.
That's interesting, because no one in my family has their tonsils.
And we were forbidden to socialize with tonsil people.
Well, it's like the Capulets and the Montagues.
Excuse me.
Anyway, I strongly recommend they come out.
What?
You mean, with a knife?
Yes, with a knife.
You know, snip, snip.
Anyway, you'd be completely under.
You wouldn't feel a thing.
And when you wake up, you can have some ice cream.
Yeah, that's what they told me the last time.
Think about it.
Excuse me.
- Sorry.
- I'm sorry.
I just have to ask that doctor one more question.
Women go after doctors like men go after models.
They want someone with knowledge of the body.
We just want the body.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Boy they got a great cafeteria downstairs.
Hot food, sandwiches, a salad bar.
It's like Sizzler opened up a hospital.
Boy So how did you have a heart attack?
You're a young man.
What were you doing?
They gonna do a zipper job?
- Oh, they love to do zipper jobs.
- Kramer.
You know, the really bad thing about the heart is the sex thing.
See, you gotta be careful about sex now.
You get that heart pumping Suddenly, boom!
Next thing you know you got a hose coming out of your chest attached to a piece of luggage.
Kramer, George didn't have a heart attack.
No?
That's good.
I have to have my tonsils taken out.
Oh, man.
No.
George, we gotta get you out of here.
Get out right now.
They'll kill you in here.
It's routine surgery.
Oh, yeah?
My friend Bob Sacamano he came in here for a hernia operation.
Oh, yeah, " routine surgery".
Now he's sitting in a chair by a window going: " My name is Bob"!
George, whatever you do, don't let them cut you.
Don't let them cut you.
Well, what should I do, Kramer?
- For one thing, don't listen to him.
- I'll tell you what you do.
I'll tell you what you do.
You go to Tor Ackman.
Tor.
He'll fix you right up.
He's an herbalist, a healer, George.
He's not just gonna fix the tonsils and the adenoids.
He is gonna change the whole way you function.
Body and mind.
Ackman?
I thought he was doing time.
No, no, he's out.
He got out.
See, the medical establishment See, they tried to frame him.
It's all politics, but he's a rebel.
A rebel?
No, Johnny Yuma was a rebel.
Ackman is a nut.
You wanna take care of your tonsils, do it in a hospital with a doctor.
He's holistic.
George, he's holistic.
- Holistic?
- Yeah.
That sounds right.
George, you need a medical doctor.
Let me ask you something.
How much do you think it would cost to have tonsils and adenoids removed in a hospital?
Well, an overnight stay in a hospital, minor surgery, I don't know four grand?
- How much does the healer charge?
- First visit?
38 bucks.
Oh, yeah.
Holistic.
That's what I need.
That's the answer.
You like the way I talked you into coming?
Don't flatter yourself, my friend.
I'm here strictly for material.
And I have a feeling this is a potential gold mine.
I still think you're nuts, though.
All I know is, I've been going to doctors all my life.
What's it gotten me?
I'm 33, I haven't outgrown the problems of puberty l'm already facing the problems of old age.
I completely skipped healthy adulthood.
I went from having orgasms immediately to taking forever.
You can do your taxes in the time it takes me to have an orgasm.
I never had a normal medium orgasm.
I never had a really good pickle.
Besides, what's it gonna cost me, Would you not put your foot on that, please?
Sorry.
- What month were you born?
- April.
You should have been born in August.
Your parents would have been well-advised to wait.
Really?
Do you use hot water in the shower?
- Yes.
- Stop using it.
- Okay.
- I'm off hot water.
Kramer tells me that you are interested in an alternative to surgery.
Yes.
Yes, I am.
I think we can help you.
See, unfortunately, the medical establishment is a business like any other business.
And business needs customers.
They want to sell you their most expensive item which is unnecessary surgery.
Can I use hot water on my face?
No.
You know I am not a businessman.
I am a holistic healer.
It's a calling.
It's a gift.
You see, it's in the best interest of the medical profession that you remain sick.
See, that insures good business.
You're not a patient, you're a customer.
And you're not a doctor, but you play one in real life.
What about shaving?
You're eating too much dairy.
May I?
I guess so.
You see?
You are in disharmony.
The throat is the gateway to the lung.
Tonsillitis, adenoiditis is, in Chinese medical terms an invasion of heat and wind.
There's some hot air blowing in here.
You know I lived with the Eskimos many years ago and they used to plunge their faces into the snow.
Can it be lukewarm?
Too much dairy?
You really think I'm eating too much dairy.
The tongue.
Yes, the tongue.
Or, in medical terms, the glossa.
It's a muscular organ.
Consists of two parts: The body and the root.
You see, it's covered by this mucous membrane.
These raised little projections here are the papillae.
It's what gives it its furred appearance.
Very tactile.
Your tea is ready now.
This will solve your so-called tonsil problem.
It's a special concoction.
- It contains cramp bark.
- I love cramp bark.
Cleavers.
Cleaver?
I once had cleaver as a kid.
I was able to lift a car.
And some couch grass.
Couch grass and cramp bark?
I think that's what killed Curly.
Go ahead, drink it, George.
Excuse me.
Tor?
May I ask you a question?
You have intuitive abilities.
You're in touch with a lot of cosmic kind of things.
I have this note I can't read.
I was wondering if Yes!
" Cleveland, 1 1 7.
San Antonio, 1 09".
Go ahead, George, drink it.
It's not too bad.
I'm an eggplant!
I'm an eggplant!
I'm a vegetable!
I didn't take your Chuckle!
I had five Chuckles.
I ate the green and the yellow.
The red is missing.
- I don't even like Chuckles!
- Maybe he doesn't like them.
My face!
My face!
Get me to the hospital!
I want that Chuckle, you hear?
You want me to get you a Chuckle?
- Pull over.
- Pull over?
- " Pull over"?
You want a piece of me?
- Yeah!
- What, you're gonna fight?
- No!
I'm a mutant!
- Let me drive.
- Come on, man, pull over!
All right.
I'm gonna mess you up, man!
Really, gentlemen, please.
My heart!
Where are you going?
!
Are you crazy?
!
- I'm gonna kick his ass!
- Hey, do you have keys?
You can't leave!
This is an ambulance!
- This is an emergency!
- I don't like Chuckles, man.
If I hear you one more time, I'm gonna kill you!
- All this over a Chuckle.
- What's a Chuckle?
It's a jelly candy.
Comes in five flavours.
You see, taste buds run on grooves along surfaces.
- Can you let go of my tongue now?
- What?
- Let go of my tongue.
- Oh, sorry.
Well, I should get going.
- What are you doing?
- I was gonna kiss you good night.
A kiss?
With the tongue?
The glossa with the bumps and the papillae?
I don't think so.
- You can't just leave him there.
- I told him I was gonna mess him up.
- Can you call him an ambulance?
- I told him I didn't take his Chuckle!
- I don't eat that gooey crap!
- Hey, watch the road.
- Watch the road, man.
- Hey, you want some of what he got?
- Hey, watch out!
- Watch out!
How you doing?
Can't talk?
Hey, how'd you get the plastic one?
I like that.
So how's life without tonsils?
What?
What's that?
So how much is this thing gonna cost you, like 5000, 6000?
Well, live and learn.
At least we lived.
Kramer went to Ackman.
He feels all better already.
What?
What are you doing?
Oh, poor George.
I'm sorry, I can't stay long.
I don't want to run into Dr. Tongue.
Here, I brought you something.
See?
- Oh, please, come on.
It's nothing.
- Hey, turn up the TV.
The planet's on fire!
It is just as you prophesised.
The planets of our solar system incinerating lik e flaming globes, Zigmond, lik e flaming globes!
That's it!
That's it!
" Flaming globes of Zigmond"!
That's my note.
That's what I thought was so funny.
It's not funny.
There's nothing funny about that.
Shut up!
I have a friend who's a hypochondriac.
Always thinks he's sick, never is.
Then you have another type of person always thinks they're well, no matter how bad they are.
You know this type of person?
Very annoying.
" Feel great.
I like being on a respirator.
Intravenous, heart-lung machine.
I never felt better in my life".
Medical science is making advances every day to control health problems.
In fact, it's probably only a matter of time before a heart attack becomes like a headache.
We'll just see people on TV going: " I had a heart attack this big but I gave myself one of these: Clear!
And it's gone".
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
I was watching women in the department store trying on clothes.
And I notice that they do it differently from men.
Women don't try on the clothes, they get behind the clothes.
They take a dress off the rack and they hold it up against themself.
They can tell something from this.
They stick one leg way out.
They need to know, " If someday I'm one-legged at a 45-degree angle what am I gonna wear"?
You never see a man do that, see a guy take a suit off the rack put his head in the neck, go, "What about this suit?
I'll get it.
Looks fine.
Put some shoes by the bottom of the pants.
I want to make sure.
Perfect.
Now, what if I'm walking?
Move the shoes, move the shoes.
Move the shoes".
What are you doing?
All right.
All right.
What's the matter with that?
What about that one?
Robert Vaughn, The Helsinki Formula?
He was good in Man From U.N. C.L.E. Guess whose birthday is coming up soon.
I know.
I know.
I'm having my root canal the same week.
I hope you got a good oral surgeon, because that can be very serious.
Hey, lookit.
Naked people.
No, I don't want to see the naked people.
Been a while?
I have a vague recollection of doing something with someone but it was a long, long time ago.
I think my last time was in Rochester.
My hair was a lot shorter.
I remember that it's a good thing.
And someday, I hope to do it again.
What?
What?
- What was that look?
- What look?
The look you just gave me.
- I gave a look?
- Yes.
- What kind of a look?
- I know that look.
- So, what was it?
- Why should I tell you?
Well, you're the big look expert.
I want to see how smart you are.
Trust me.
I know the look.
- So?
- What?
- What about the look?
- I don't know.
- You got something on your mind?
- No.
Things pop into your head.
You?
Things occur to me from time to time.
Yeah.
Me too.
Well, you can't expect to just forget the past completely.
Well, no, of course not.
I mean, it's something we did.
Probably about what, 25 times.
Thirty-seven.
Yeah, we pretty much know what we're doing in there.
- We know the terrain.
- No big surprises.
Nope.
- What do you think?
- I don't know.
What do you think?
Well, it's something to consider.
- Yeah.
- I mean, let's say what if we did?
- What if?
Is that, like, the end of the world or something?
- Certainly not.
- Why shouldn't we be able to do that once in a while if we want to?
- I know.
I mean, really, what is the big deal?
We go in there we're in there for a while, then we come back out here.
That's not complicated.
It's almost stupid if we didn't.
- It's moronic.
- Absurd.
Course I guess maybe some little problems could arise.
There are always a few.
I mean, if anything happened and we couldn't be friends the way we are now, that would really be bad.
- Devastating.
- Because this is very good.
And that would be good.
That would be good too.
The idea is to combine the this and the that.
But this cannot be disturbed.
Yeah, we just want to take this and add that.
But of course, we'd have to figure out a way to avoid the things that cause the little problems.
Maybe some rules or something.
For example: Now I call you whenever I'm inclined, and vice versa.
But if we did that, we might feel a certain obligation to call.
Well, why should that be?
I have an idea.
No calls the day after that.
Beautiful.
Let's make it a rule.
All right, sir.
- Now, here's another little rule.
- Yeah.
When we see each other now we retire to our separate quarters.
But sometimes when people get involved with that they feel pressure to sleep over.
When that is not really sleep.
Sleep is separate from that, and I don't see why sleep got all tied up and connected with that.
Okay, okay, rule number two: Spending the night is optional.
Well, now we're getting somewhere.
Good.
- What about the kiss good night?
- Tough one.
Your call.
It's bourgeois.
Fine.
Well.
Well.
You ready?
Ready.
So you think you can handle this?
Definitely.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Got the paper?
- Not yet.
- No paper.
- I haven't been out yet.
Well, what's taking you so long?
Oh, yeah.
What's the deal with Aquaman?
Could he go on the land, or was he just restricted to water?
No, I think I saw him on land a couple times.
So how's the job situation going?
Still looking.
Pretty bad out there.
What about you?
Nothing much.
I slept with Elaine last night.
Oxygen.
I need some oxygen.
- This is major.
- I thought you'd like that.
Oh, this is huge!
- I know.
- All right, okay.
Let's go.
Details.
No, I can't give details.
- You what?
- I can't give details.
No details?
I'm not in the mood.
You ask me here to have lunch tell me you slept with Elaine and then say you're not in the mood for details.
Now, you listen to me.
I want details, and I want them right now.
I don't have a job, I have no place to go.
You're not in the mood?
Well, you get in the mood!
All right.
Okay.
We were in my apartment, watching TV.
- Where you sitting?
- On the couch.
- Next to each other?
- Separate.
- Time?
- Around 1 1.
Okay, go ahead.
So she's flipping around the TV and she gets to the naked station.
See, that's why I don't have cable, because of that naked station.
If I had that in my house, I would never turn it off.
I wouldn't sleep.
I wouldn't eat.
Eventually, firemen would break through the door.
They'd find me in my pyjamas with drool coming down my face.
All right, so you're watching the naked station.
And then somehow we started talking about, "What if we had sex"?
Boy, these are really bad details.
It pains me to say this, but I may be getting too mature for details.
I hate to hear this.
Any kind of growth really irritates me.
- I'll tell you, it was really passionate.
- Better than before?
She must have taken some kind of seminar or something.
This is all too much.
So, what are you feeling?
What's going on?
Are you, like, a couple again now?
- Not exactly.
- " Not exactly".
What does that mean?
Well, we've tried to arrange a situation where we'll be able to do this once in a while and still be friends.
What?
Where are you living?
Are you here?
Are you on this planet?
It's impossible.
It can't be done.
Thousands of years, people have tried to have their cake and eat it too.
So all of a sudden, the two of you are gonna come along and do it.
Where do you get the ego?
No one can do it.
It can't be done.
I think we've worked out a system.
You know what you're like?
You're like a pathetic gambler.
One of these losers in Las Vegas who keeps thinking he's gonna come up with a way to win at blackjack.
No, this is very advanced.
We've designed a set of rules.
That we can maintain the friendship by avoiding all the relationship pitfalls.
All right, all right.
Tell me the rules.
Okay.
No calls the next day.
So you have the sex, next day, you don't have to call.
That's pretty good.
- Go ahead.
- You ready for the second one?
I have to tell you, I'm very impressed with the first one.
Spending the night: Optional.
No.
No.
You see?
You got greedy.
No, that's the rule.
It's optional.
I know less about women than anyone in the world.
But the one thing I do know is, they're not happy if you don't spend the night.
It could be a hot, sweaty room with no air conditioning and all they have is a little Army cot this wide.
You're not going anywhere.
- I think you're wrong.
- I hope I am.
- Is this yours or the roommate's?
- Roommate's.
- Would she mind?
- She keeps track of everything.
Well, that's too bad, because I'm taking it.
Oh, thanks.
Well guess I'll get going.
I got that root canal tomorrow morning.
It'll be easy if I go home.
Fine.
Go ahead.
I don't understand.
Is there a problem?
I'm getting the impression there's a problem.
- Just go.
- I'm having surgery tomorrow.
- Surgery!
You're going to the dentist!
- You said it could be very serious.
Okay.
So fine, go.
What happened to the rules?
Remember?
Sleeping over was optional.
- It's my house, it's my option!
- It has nothing to do with that!
- Of course it does.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- HI.
- Hi, Jerry.
- Hi.
Such a great improv class tonight.
Really?
I had this improv where I pretended I was working in one of those booths in an amusement park where you shoot water in the clown's mouth and blow up the balloon.
Tina, could you excuse us for just one second?
Yeah.
I'll excuse you.
- What are you doing?
- I can't go if you're mad.
I'm not mad.
You seem a little mad.
No, Jerry, I'm fine.
Really, it's okay.
So you're okay with everything?
Definitely.
Are you?
Definitely.
Well good night.
- Good ni - What are you doing?
- What?
The rules.
Hey, who took my cake?
What about jewellery?
That's a nice birthday gift.
Oh, no, I have to be very careful here.
I don't want to send the wrong message.
Not after the other night.
- Maybe I'll get her some jewellery.
- No.
You can't get her anything better than me.
Whatever I spend, you have to spend half.
What am I supposed to get, a bazooka?
You don't understand.
I'm in a very delicate position.
Whatever I give her, she'll be bringing in experts from all over the country to interpret the meaning behind it.
What does she need?
Maybe there's something that she needs.
I think I heard her say something about a bench.
A bench?
- What kind of a bench?
- I don't know.
- She mentioned a bench.
- What, like at a bus stop?
- I don't know.
- Like a park bench?
I have no idea.
- Who puts a bench in the house?
- Forget the bench!
I got it.
You want something nice?
What about a music box?
No, too relationship-y.
I mean, she opens it up, she hears that " Lara's Theme," I'm dead.
Okay, what about a nice frame with a picture of another guy in it?
The frame says, " I care for you, but if you want to get serious perhaps you'd be interested in someone like this".
Nice-looking fellow.
- What about candleholders?
- Too romantic.
- Lingerie?
- Too sexual.
- Waffle maker?
- Too domestic.
Bust of Nelson Rockefeller?
Too gubernatorial.
Let's work on the card.
I had to buy a gift for someone.
The hardest part is that card.
The card is a killer.
I never know what it's supposed to say.
And it's getting so tough, because the relationships are so complicated greeting-card companies now put out cards that are blank on the inside.
Nothing.
No message.
It's like the card company says: "We give up.
You think of something".
You know?
" For 7 5 cents, I don't want to get involved".
- Maybe you won't like it.
- How could I not like it?
- Of course I'll like it.
- You could not like it.
Just the fact that you remembered means everything.
Of course I remembered.
You reminded me every day for two months.
Oh, the card.
- Cash?
- What do you think?
You got me cash?
This way, I figure you could go out and get yourself whatever you want.
No good?
Who are you, my uncle?
Hey.
Come on, it's $1 82 there.
I don't think that's anything to sneeze at.
Let me see the card.
"To a wonderful girl, a great pal and more".
Hey.
Elaine, I'm glad you're here.
Stay right here.
I'm gonna be right back.
Stay.
" Pal"?
You think I'm your pal?
I said, "and more".
I am not your pal.
What's wrong with pal?
Why is everybody so down on pal?
- Hey.
- Oh, what is this?
- You got me something?
- Yeah.
Yeah, open it.
Kramer!
The bench!
You got me the bench that I wanted!
- That's pretty good, huh?
- Great.
You remember when she mentioned it?
I made a mental note of it.
Well, goody for you.
Yeah.
See, I'm very sensitive about that.
I mean, someone's birthday comes up, I keep my ears open.
So, what did you get her?
Cash?
You've gotta be kidding.
What kind of gift is that?
That's like something her uncle would give her.
"Think where man's glory most begins and ends and say my glory was I had such a friend".
Yeats.
Oh, Kramer.
Could you excuse us, please?
What?
We're talking.
Oh, the relationship.
You know, we never had one fight before this deal.
- I know.
- Never.
- Ever.
- We got along beautifully.
- Like clams.
- It was wonderful.
A pleasure.
So I think we should forget the whole deal and go back to being friends.
I can't do it.
You what?
I can't do that.
You mean, it's: No this?
No that.
No this or that.
Oh, boy.
What do you want?
This, that and the other.
Oh, sure.
Of course.
You're entitled.
Who doesn't want this, that and the other?
You.
Well Those birthdays.
I told you, they're relationship killers.
If a relationship's having any problems whatsoever, a birthday brings it out.
I never should have made up those rules.
What is it about sex that just disrupts everything?
Is it the touching?
Is it the nudity?
It can't be the nudity.
I never got into these terrible fights and misunderstandings when I was changing before gym class.
This means I can't see her anymore either.
- Why?
- It's breakup by association.
Besides, she's mad at me anyway because of my birthday present.
Why?
What did you wind up giving her?
Ninety-one dollars.
Sorry about that.
So, what are you gonna do?
If I call her, there's no joking around anymore.
This is pretty much it.
So maybe this should be it.
- Could be it.
- She seems like an it.
She's as it as you get.
Imagine bumping into her on the street in five years with a husband.
And she tells me that he's a sculptor.
They live in Vermont.
We'd have to kill him.
We'd get caught.
I'd get the chair.
I'd go to prison as your accomplice.
Have to wear that really heavy denim.
The cafeteria, with the guy who slops the mashed potatoes onto your plate.
Go to the bathroom in front of hundreds of people.
Plus you know what else.
You better call her.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- You got the paper yet?
- Yeah.
Well, where is it?
- Hey, you done with that?
- No.
Well, you're not reading it now.
All right, you can take it, but I want it back.
Yeah, yeah.
So what are you guys gonna do today?
This and that.
And the other.
Boy, I really liked the two of you much better when you weren't a couple.
Why is commitment such a big problem for a man?
I think that for some reason when a man is driving down that freeway of life the woman he's involved with is like an exit.
But he doesn't want to get out.
He wants to keep driving.
The woman is like, " Look.
Gas, food, lodging.
That's our exit.
That's everything we need to be happy.
Get out, here, now"!
But the man focuses on the sign underneath that says, " Next exit, 27 miles".
And he thinks, " I can make it".
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Men flip around the television more than women, I think.
Men get that remote control in their hands They don't even know what they're not watching.
" Rerun, don't wanna watch it".
"What are you watching"?
" Don't care".
"Who was that"?
" Don't know".
" Isn't that your father"?
" Doesn't matter, I gotta keep going".
Women don't do that.
See, now, women will stop and go, "Well, let me see what the show is before I change the channel".
You see, but men just fly.
Because women You see, women nest, and men hunt.
That's why we watch TV differently.
Before there was flipping around, before there was television kings and emperors and pharaohs and such had storytellers that would tell them stories.
That was their entertainment.
I always wonder in that era if they would get 30 storytellers together so they could still flip around.
Just go: "Tell me your story.
I don't wanna hear anymore.
Shut up.
Next guy.
What are you talking about?
Is there a girl in that story?
No?
Shut up.
What have you got?
I don't wanna hear that.
What are you talking about?
Don't wanna hear it.
Now, the whole of you, get out of here.
I'm going to bed".
She's pregnant?
Leslie is pregnant?
Oh, see, there is no justice.
She's the performance artist, right?
Yeah, performance artist.
She's a performer, a real trouper.
What's her husband's name again?
Chip?
Kip?
Skip?
- Todd.
- Todd.
Oh, yeah.
- He's a Kennedy.
- No, he's not.
- Come on, he's a third cousin.
- By marriage.
Oh, by marriage, yeah.
We went to the wedding.
Should've heard them talk about Chappaquiddick.
Tried to blame the whole thing on bad directions.
That woman was unequivocally the worst date of my life.
Pardon me for setting you up with a beautiful, intelligent woman.
What, you don't think I can attract beautiful, intelligent women?
Thin ice, George, very thin ice.
Maybe for her new performance piece, she'll give birth on-stage.
She stopped performing.
What a huge blow to the culture.
You believe this guy?
He holds a grudge like Khomeini.
She dragged me down to that warehouse on the waterfront in Brooklyn to see one of her performances.
Oh, and she's on-stage cooking dinner for some celebrity?
God.
She's cooking dinner for God.
She's yelling, and the next thing I know she throws a big can of chocolate syrup all over my new red shirt.
- It was an accident.
- Oh, yeah, accident, right.
She was aiming at me, like she was putting out a fire.
So for the rest of the show I'm sitting there with chocolate all over me.
Flies are landing on me.
I'm boiling, I'm fantasizing all the things I'm gonna say to her.
Later, finally, backstage, when I talk to her l'm like a little grovelling worm: "What kind of chocolate was that"?
" Do you throw any other foods"?
You know He thought he still had a shot.
Then, then, then she leaves with somebody else.
Never even Never even said goodbye.
Never called me back.
Never apologized.
Nothing.
Like I was dirt.
What ever happened with the shirt?
I still have it.
The collar's okay.
I wear it under sweaters.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
She asked me to give her a baby shower.
Asked you?
You're not gonna do that, are you?
Anyone else, never.
But Leslie I have a problem saying no to her.
For some reason, I seem to want her approval.
Let Maria Shriver give her a baby shower.
Ask not what I can do for you, ask what you can do for me.
Ich bin ein sucker.
Would you two stop with the Kennedys?
Why does everyone make such a big deal about the Kennedys?
I mean, what is this fascination?
Who cares?
It's all so boring.
Look, she doesn't deserve a baby shower.
She deserves a baby monsoon.
She deserves Rosemary's baby.
I do have one teeny little problem, though.
Never said goodbye.
Never apologized.
Nothing.
See, I was gonna give the shower in my apartment - But?
- My roommate has Lyme disease.
Lyme disease?
I thought she had Epstein-Barr syndrome.
She has this in addition to Epstein-Barr.
It's like Epstein-Barr with a twist of Lyme disease.
- How'd she get Lyme disease?
- I don't know.
She did some outdoor version of Hair in Danbury, Connecticut.
- They still do that play?
- It's a classic.
- With the nudity?
- I guess.
She must've rolled over on a tick during the love-in.
Never said goodbye.
Goodbye.
Explain to me how this baby shower thing works.
What do you want to know?
Well, I mean does it ever erupt into a drunken orgy of violence?
Rarely.
There's no hazing of the foetus or anything, is there?
No.
- When is this supposed to be?
- Saturday.
Saturday.
Well, I have a show in Buffalo on Saturday.
They're not gonna bust up my apartment, are they?
No, I'll take full responsibility.
Because I've seen pregnant women and they sometimes misjudge their foetal girth.
And they'll Just, like, one wrong turn, the whole buffet is, like, right off the table.
Someday, before I die, mark my words l'm gonna tell that woman what I think of her.
I'll never be able to forgive myself until I do.
- And if you do?
- I still won't forgive myself but at least it won't be about this.
What are you doing this for?
Look at you.
- Quiet.
I'm trying to get a picture.
- But you don't have to.
- The guy is waiting in my house.
- Leave me alone.
It's a one-time fee, 1 50 bucks.
- Why live like this?
- I'm not getting illegal cable.
So you're gonna wait for the cable companies to resolve their dispute?
They'll be in court for years.
- I read in the paper - Oh, the paper - They might hook us up again.
- Oh, God.
You're so naive.
All the cable companies care about is the big "mamoo".
Look at you.
You're banging things.
You're just pathetic.
Just wasting your life.
I'm offering you 56 channels.
Movies, sports, nudity, and it's free for life!
Stop shouting.
You're ruining the reception.
Can you hear yourself?
Can?
Do you know what you're saying?
- What you're suggesting is illegal.
- It's not illegal.
- It's against the law.
- Well, yeah.
Just hold this.
Can you hold that?
Look, will you at least let me bring the guy over?
He's an amazing man.
He's a Russian immigrant.
He escaped from the Gulag.
He's like the Sakharov of cable guys.
He'll slow down your gas meter.
He sells slugs, Jerry.
Slugs for the subway.
- He's a real human-rights nut, huh?
- Yeah.
He's intense, man.
I don't know.
- What if I get caught?
- You're not gonna get caught.
Let me get him in.
It's the '90s.
It's Hammer Time.
Come on.
Just let me get him.
Jerry, Jerry, this is the cable man.
You know, why don't we wait because I'm going out of town tomorrow Tomorrow okay.
No problem.
You'll have the whole thing installed by the time you get back.
No, every time I turn on a TV, sirens are gonna go off.
They're gonna track me down like a dog, I know it.
Look, now, Jerry, it's no risk.
I swear.
The Mets have 7 5 games on cable this year.
Put it in.
You won't regret it.
Yeah, Jerry's gonna be a cable boy A cable boy, a cable boy - Mr. Steinfeld?
- Seinfeld.
We're with the FBI.
You wanna tell us about your cable hookup?
My cable hookup?
What about it?
It's been illegally installed.
It has?
I've been out of town.
How did you know?
Jerry, I had to tell them.
I had to.
I had no choice.
They were onto the scam from the very beginning.
You're in very serious trouble, Mr. Steinfeld.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Hold on.
We're just patsies.
We're just a couple of users.
We never sold the stuff.
What about the Russian guy?
The Russian guy's the guy you want.
Mr. Seinfeld?
Agent Stone, FBI undercover.
No, Jerry!
No!
Cable boy?
Cable boy?
What have you done to my little cable boy?
Excuse me, could I get something to drink?
I'm afraid not.
What's with this airline?
You're cutting out the drinks?
No, sir, we're flying into a blizzard.
Please fasten your seat belt.
We're making an emergency landing.
Are they gonna go over the instructions again?
My name is Bill.
I might be the last person you ever see.
I'm not afraid of flying, although many people do have fear of flying.
And I have no argument with that.
I think fear of flying is quite rational, because human beings cannot fly.
Humans have fear of flying, same way fish have fear of driving.
You put a fish behind the wheel, and they go, "This isn't right.
I shouldn't be doing this.
I don't belong here".
- Sounds like a rough trip.
- Well there were fire engines and ambulances all on the runway.
And then when we landed safely, they all seemed so disappointed.
So the college cancelled the gig?
There was so much snow, the roads were closed.
I really appreciate you picking me up.
Thanks again.
- Forget it.
- No, really, an airport run.
It's nothing.
It's one thing if I asked you, " Could you do me a favour"?
But to suggest it When you told me what you went through on the plane it makes you stop and think.
I appreciate having a real friend.
If Richie Brandis did this, I'd be suspicious.
You know how he's always got some ulterior motive?
Ulterior motive Wait a minute.
Don't take the bridge.
Get off here.
We can't go back to my place.
Elaine's having the shower.
- What, tonight?
Now?
- Yeah.
Yeah, I forgot all about it.
No big deal.
We'll go back to your place.
My place?
No, no.
I hate my place.
I don't wanna go back to my place.
Well, you wanna get a bite?
Well, yeah, I would.
It's just that I just ate a whole pot roast.
Well, so, what should we do?
You know, shouldn't we at least drop off your bag?
Red shirt!
Red shirt!
That's the red shirt!
- What are you talking about?
- You're wearing the chocolate shirt!
I am.
What a strange coincidence.
Nice try, my friend, but you gotta get up pretty early in the morning.
You gotta let me go over there.
What, you're gonna badger a pregnant woman at her own baby shower?
You're gonna take it off and make her rinse it in club soda?
No.
I'm gonna hold it under her nose so she can smell the scent of stale Bosco that I had to live with for three years.
Then I'm gonna say, " Remember this shirt, baby?
Well, now it's payback time"!
We just bought an apartment on Riverside Drive.
Bernard Goetz's mother used to live there.
- So where's Todd?
- Up in Hyannisport.
Oh, my God, Hyannisport?
With the Kennedys?
Who else is up there?
Is Rose up there?
- So when's your due date?
- March 20th, 9 a.m. - You know the time?
- I'm having a planned C-section.
My therapist told me if I go through labour, I might get psychotic.
Leslie, Leslie, what ever happened to Sargent Shriver?
Is he still with them?
You don't hear much about him these days.
Is he, like, out of the loop, or?
Elaine, who catered this, Sears?
What is this?
What are you doing here?
- We're putting in the cable.
- The cable?
No, I'm having a party here.
You can't do this now.
Oh, we have to do this now.
- Who is this guy?
- Which one?
- Both of them.
- They're Soviet cable guys.
Okay.
Does Jerry know about this?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
It's all authorized.
Yeah.
- You can't.
You can't do this now!
- Elaine Do you know how booked up this guy is?
If I send him away now, it's gonna take Jerry months to get him back.
He won't like that.
All right.
Just do it fast, and then get out.
Anatole?
Giddap.
Go.
It's only gonna take a few minutes.
Then you and the gals can take a load off and watch something on Lifetime.
What if we go up there, what are you gonna say to her?
- What am I gonna say?
- Yeah.
"What did you go out with me for?
Just to dump chocolate on my shirt, and then dump me altogether?
I don't deserve that kind of treatment.
You don't have the common courtesy to return my calls?
To apologize?
You think I'm some sort of a loser that likes to be abused and ignored?
Whose shirt can be ruined without financial restitution?
Some sort of a masochist who enjoys being humiliated?
You think you can just avoid me like I have some disease?
You have the disease!
You have the disease!
You may be beautiful and rich and physically just unbelievable, but you sicken me.
You disgust me.
You and everyone like you".
- You'll never say that to her face.
- Watch me.
Yeah, I eat the whole apple.
Core, stem, seeds, just everything.
Kramer.
Kramer, look at him.
- Look.
He's eating all the food.
- Yeah, yeah.
Well, you know, there are many differences between American and Soviet cultures that you're not aware of.
See, in Russia, the cable guy, they got the whole run of the house.
Yeah, that's tradition.
You ever eat the bark off of a pineapple?
- Kramer!
Kramer!
- Excuse me.
Wow, man!
What are you doing here?
I thought you were out of town.
The show was cancelled.
There was a blizzard.
I can't believe you told Kramer to install cable during the shower.
Jerry, look, look.
They've eaten everything.
Jerry, what a surprise.
I thought you'd left town.
Well, Leslie, sometimes the road less travelled is less travelled for a reason.
George, don't even think about it.
Don't even dream about it.
- About what?
- Kramer!
Leslie.
Yeah?
George.
George Costanza.
Hi.
I guess you don't remember me but we actually went out a couple years ago once.
Remember?
- Vaguely.
- Yeah.
You took me to see one of your shows.
And?
And it was quite good.
In fact, you even incorporated me into the show.
I'm not actually a performer, although my parents felt I had talent Jerry?
Remember me?
- I'm sorry - Mary Contardi.
No?
Doesn't ring a bell, Jerry?
We had a date three years ago.
You took me to one of your shows.
- I think I remember.
- Told me you had a great time.
- Said you'd call me the next day.
- I'm sure I meant to call.
- I probably just lost your - Liar!
Liar!
You were never going to call me.
You thought you could waltz through life and never bump into me again.
But you were wrong, Jerry.
You were wrong.
What do you think?
I'm some poor pathetic wretch?
- I didn't think that.
- To be dismissed and ignored.
Some insignificant piece of dust?
Some person who doesn't deserve respect and attention?
Well, you're the one who doesn't deserve my respect and attention!
You're the insignificant piece of dust!
Actually, I never had any formal training.
I guess I'd be better suited for improvs or something Thanks a lot.
Oh, bye.
- Oh, I'm so sorry you have to go.
- Yeah, I really have to be going.
All right, listen.
I've changed my mind.
I don't want the cable.
- Jerry, don't be a fool.
- You don't want?
No, I don't want.
Tell me what I owe you for your trouble Four hundred dollars.
Four hundred dollars.
You told me 1 50.
Oh, well I'm going.
Obviously.
Oh, Leslie, I am so sorry about everything that went on here tonight.
- I had no idea - Elaine I was watching you tonight, and I realized something.
You're just like you were in college.
Thank you.
What was I like in college?
Come on, let's go.
Be right back.
I'm not paying $400.
I don't even want the thing.
What are you gonna do?
Every woman on the face of the earth has complete control of my life and yet I want them all.
Is that irony?
Why can't I meet a Kennedy?
I saw John Jr. Once downtown.
I was on a bus.
I hit the ding.
It didn't stop.
All right.
I said I had a good time and I'd call but who takes that literally?
Hey, come on over.
Doctor Zhivago's on cable in five minutes.
I'm making popcorn!
What do you do at the end of a date when you know you don't want to see this person ever again for the rest of your life?
What do you say?
What do you say?
It doesn't No matter what you say, it's a lie.
" I'll see you around.
See you around.
If you're around and I'm around l'll see you around that area.
You'll be around other people, you won't be around me but you will be around.
Take care now".
You ever say that to somebody?
"Take care now.
Take care now.
Because I'm not gonna be taking care of you so you should take care now".
"Take care, take care".
What does that mean?
"Take care".
"Take off".
Isn't that what you really wanna say?
"Take off now.
Get out of here".
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
I'm on the street the other day, make a pay phone call go overtime on the call hang up the phone, walk away.
You've had this happen?
What?
Phone rings.
It's the phone company.
They want more money.
Don't you love this?
And you've got them right where you want them for the first time in your life.
You're on the street.
There's nothing they can do.
I like to let it ring a few times you know, let her sweat a little over there and then just pick it up.
"Yeah, hello, operator?
Oh, I've got the money.
I've got the money right here.
You hear that?
That's a quarter.
Yeah, you want that, don't you"?
No, they just have to get more cops on the force, it's as simple as that.
Cops, I don't even care about cops.
I wanna see garbage men.
It's much more important.
All I wanna see are garbage trucks, garbage cans and garbage men.
You're never gonna stop crime.
We should at least be clean.
I tell you what they should do.
They should combine the two jobs.
Make it one job.
Coplgarbage man.
I always see cops walking around with nothing to do.
Grab a broom.
Start sweeping.
You sweep, sweep, sweep.
Catch a criminal, get right back to sweeping.
- You should run for mayor.
- Nobody listens.
Where is someone?
I'm starving.
Think this is him right here.
- Is there a table ready?
- How many?
- How many?
- Is Tatiana coming?
Well, I don't know.
I have to call her, tell her where we are.
I'm very lucky she's even considering seeing me at all.
Really?
I thought things were going okay.
They were.
It's kind of complicated.
Well, what is it?
- How many?
- All right, four.
Seinfeld.
Four.
That'll be five, 1 0 minutes.
- What do you wanna do?
- Let's go someplace else.
- I am too hungry.
- We might as well just stay here.
We haven't got much time before the movie.
I'm gonna call Tatiana.
There's the phone.
Tatiana.
Excuse me.
Are you gonna be very long?
Lasbrook, four.
- So did I do a terrible thing?
- You mean lying to your uncle?
I couldn't have dinner with him.
Plan 9 from Outer Space.
One night only.
The big screen.
My hands are tied.
You know, it's a public phone.
You're not supposed to just chitchat.
Jerry, get menus so when we sit down we'll be able to order right away.
Can't look at a menu now, I gotta be at the table.
He knows I'm waiting.
He sees me.
He just doesn't wanna look.
Everything's gotta be just so all the time with you, doesn't it?
I offered you those cookies in my house.
Health cookies.
I hate those little dust-board fructose things.
I just can't believe the way people are.
What is it with humanity?
What kind of a world do we live in?
What?
There's a woman over there looks really familiar.
Dark hair, striped shirt.
I've never seen her before.
I know this woman.
This is gonna drive me crazy.
- Excuse me.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
Did you see that?
Those people Look, they're getting a table.
Maybe they were here from before.
No, no, they weren't here before.
Are you gonna be much longer?
I have to make a very important call.
Find out what's going on.
Excuse me.
Didn't those people just come in?
- I believe we were ahead of them.
- Yeah.
- What's your name?
- Seinfeld.
No, no.
They were here before.
Kackige, two.
You ever notice how happy people are when they finally get a table?
They feel so special because they've been chosen.
It's enough to make you sick.
Boy, you are really hungry.
Hey.
If anything happens here, can I count on you?
What?
If we decide to go at it.
Yeah, I wanna get into a rumble.
I have to get in touch with Tatiana.
Look at his little outfit.
It's all so coordinated.
The little socks match the little shirt.
I really hate this guy.
Oh, I'm gonna faint.
George who is that woman In the stripes?
I don't know her.
She looks so familiar.
It's not fair that people are seated first come, first served.
It should be based on who's hungriest.
I feel like walking over there and taking some food off of somebody's plate.
I'll tell you what.
There's 50 bucks in it for you if you do it.
What do you mean?
You walk over to that table you pick up an egg roll, you don't say anything you eat it say, "Thank you very much" wipe your mouth, walk away I give you 50 bucks.
- What are they gonna do?
- They won't do anything.
In fact you'll be giving them a story to tell for the rest of their lives.
Fifty bucks?
You'll give me 50 bucks?
Fifty bucks.
That table over there.
The three couples.
Okay, I don't wanna go over there and do it and then come back here and find out there was some little loophole like I didn't put mustard on it or something.
No tricks.
- Should I do it, George?
- For 50 bucks?
I'd put my face in their soup and blow.
All right.
All right.
Here, hold this.
I'm doing it.
I know this sounds crazy, but the two men standing behind me will give me 50 bucks if I stand here and eat one of your egg rolls.
I'll give you 25 if you let me do it.
- What?
- What is she talking about?
What did she say?
What did she say?
- Will someone tell me what she said?
- Twenty-five dollars?
- What happened?
- Did you see that?
- What were you telling them?
- I offered them 25.
- They had no idea why.
- Oh, God.
- George, the phone's free.
- Hallelujah.
Excuse me.
I was waiting here.
- Where?
I didn't see you.
- I've been here for 1 0 minutes.
- I won't be long.
- That's not the point.
The point is I was here first.
Well, if you were here first you'd be holding the phone.
You know, we're living in a society!
We're supposed to act in a civilized way!
Does she care?
No.
Does anyone ever display the slightest sensitivity over the problems of a fellow individual?
No.
No!
A resounding no.
- Hey, sorry I took so long.
- Oh, that's okay.
Really, don't worry about it.
How do people fast?
Did Gandhi get this crazy?
I'm gonna go walk around and see what dishes look good.
I told my uncle I had a stomachache.
Think he bought that?
Yeah, he probably bought it.
So, what happened with Tatiana?
- I shouldn't even tell you.
- Come on.
After dinner last week, she invites me to her apartment.
I'm with you.
Well, it's this little place with this little bathroom.
And it's, like, right there, you know?
It's not even down a little hall or off in an alcove, you understand?
There's no buffer zone.
So we start to fool around and it's the first time, and it's early in the going and I begin to perceive this impending intestinal requirement whose needs are going to surpass, by great lengths anything in the sexual realm.
So I know I'm gonna have to stop.
And as this is happening, I'm thinking even if I can somehow manage to momentarily extricate myself from the proceedings and relieve this unstoppable force I know that that bathroom is not gonna provide me with the privacy that I know I'm going to need.
This could only happen to you.
So I finally stop and say: "Tatiana, I hope you don't take this the wrong way but I think it would be best if I left".
You said this to her after?
No.
During.
- Oh, boy.
- Yeah.
Wow.
So?
So I'm dressing, and she's staring up at me struggling to compute this unprecedented turn of events.
I don't know what to say to reassure her.
And worst of all, I don't have the time to say it.
The only excuse she might possibly have accepted is if I told her I am, in reality, Batman.
And I'm very sorry, I just saw the Bat Signal.
It took me three days of phone calls to get her to agree to see me again.
Now she's waiting for me to call, and she's still on the phone.
I hate this place.
I don't know why we came here.
I am never coming back here again.
Who is that woman?
Remember when you first went out to eat with your parents?
Remember?
It was such a treat to go.
And they serve you this different food that you never saw before.
And they put it in front of you and it was such a delicious and exciting adventure.
And now I just feel like a big sweaty hog waiting for them to fill up the trough.
Oh, she's off.
- Jerry, talk to that guy again.
- What am I gonna say?
Tell him we wanna catch a movie and that we're late.
Hey.
What stinks in here?
Mr. Cohen, haven't seen you for a couple of weeks.
Well, I've been looking for a better place.
Better place!
Want a?
Want a table?
No, just bring me a plate, and I'll eat here.
Bring him a plate.
He'll eat here.
Come on, I'll give you a table.
Excuse me.
We've been waiting here.
Now, I know we were ahead of that guy.
He just came in.
Oh, no.
Mr. Cohen always here.
He's always here?
What does that mean?
What does that mean?
Mr. Cohen, very nice man.
He live on Park Avenue.
Where am I?
Is this a dream?
What in God's name is going on here?
She's not there.
She left.
She must have waited and left, because those people wouldn't get off.
- Did you leave a message?
- Yeah, I told her to call me here and to tell anyone that answers to ask for a balding, stocky man with glasses.
I better tell them I'm expecting a call.
- Jerry, here comes that woman.
- Where do I know her?
- Hi, Jerry.
- Hey.
How are you doing?
- How is everything?
- Good, good.
What's going on?
I'm working hard.
And you?
Oh, you know, working around.
Same stuff.
Doing whatever.
- You haven't been around in a while.
- I know.
I know.
Well you know.
You should come by.
Definitely.
I plan to.
I'm not just saying that.
- Hi.
I'm Elaine.
- Oh, Lorraine Catalano.
I'm sorry.
Lorraine, this is Elaine.
Well, it was nice seeing you, Jerry.
And nice meeting you.
Oh, nice to meet you too, Lorraine.
Oh, my God, Lorraine.
That's Lorraine from my uncle's office.
I am in big, big trouble.
- The one you broke the plans with?
- Yeah, she works in his office.
Now she's gonna see him tomorrow and tell him she saw me here tonight.
He's gonna tell his wife.
His wife's gonna call my mother.
Oh, this is bad.
You don't know.
The chain reaction of calls this is gonna set off.
New York, Long Island, Florida.
It's like the Bermuda Triangle.
Unfortunately, nobody ever disappears.
My uncle to my aunt, my aunt to my mother my mother to my uncle.
My uncle to my cousin, my cousin to my sister, my sister to me.
You should've just had dinner with him tonight and gotten it over with.
- It's just a movie.
- Just a movie?
You don't understand.
This isn't Plans 1-8 from Outer Space.
This is Plan 9.
This is the one that worked.
The worst movie ever made.
I'm really looking forward to it.
I got news for you.
If we're making this movie we gotta get a table immediately.
Let's stop fooling around.
Let's just slip him some money.
In a Chinese restaurant?
Do they take money?
" Do they take money"?
Everyone takes money.
I went out with a guy who did it all the time.
You slip them 20 bucks.
Twenty bucks?
Isn't that excessive?
Well, what do you wanna give him, change?
It's more than the meal.
Oh, come on, we'll divide it up three ways.
All right.
Seven, seven, six.
I'm not gonna eat that much.
I'm counting your shrimps.
Okay, who's gonna do it?
Oh, no, I can't do it.
I'm not good at these things.
I get flustered.
Once I tried to bribe an usher at the Roller Derby.
I almost got arrested.
I guess it's you, Jer.
- Me?
What about you?
- Oh, I can't do that.
It's a guy thing.
The women's movement just can't seem to make any progress in the world of bribery, can they?
Give me the money.
How's it going?
Very busy.
Boy, we are really anxious to sit down.
Very good specials tonight.
If there's anything you can do to get us a table we'd really appreciate it.
Oh, what is your name?
No, no, I wanna eat now.
Yes, whole sea bass dinner tonight, very fresh.
Here.
Take this.
I'm starving.
Take it.
Take it.
Dennison, four!
Your table is ready.
No, no.
I want that table.
I want that table!
Come on, did you see that?
What was that?
He took the money.
He didn't give us a table.
- You lost the 20.
- Well, how could he do that?
- You didn't make it clear.
- Make it clear?
What a sorry exhibition that was.
All right, let me get the money back.
Excuse me.
I realize this is extremely embarrassing.
My friend here apparently made a mistake.
Your name?
- Seinfeld.
- Yes, Seinfeld, four.
No, no.
Do you see the girl over there with the long hair?
Oh, yes, yes.
Very beautiful girl.
Very beautiful.
Your girlfriend?
Well, actually, we did date for a while, but That's really not relevant here.
Relationships are difficult.
It is very hard to stay together All right, listen.
All right.
How much longer is it gonna be?
Be about five, 1 0 minutes.
So?
There seems to be a bit of a discrepancy.
- So when are we gonna eat?
- Five, 1 0 minutes.
We should've left earlier.
I told you.
I don't see any way we can eat and make this movie.
Oh, well, I have to eat.
Let's order it to go, We'll eat it in the cab.
Eat it in the cab?
Chinese food in a cab?
- We'll eat it in the movie.
- Where do you think you're going?
You think they have big picnic tables there?
- Well, what do you suggest?
- I say we leave now we go to Sky Burger, and we scarf them down.
I'm not going to Sky Burger.
Besides, it's in the opposite direction.
- Let's just eat popcorn or something.
- Cartwright?
I can't have popcorn for dinner.
- Cartwright!
- I have to eat.
Well, they have hot dogs there.
Oh, movie hot dogs?
I'd rather lick the food off the floor.
I can't go anyway.
I have to wait here for Tatiana's call.
Let me just check.
Excuse me, I'm expecting a call.
Costanza?
Yes.
I just got a call.
I yell, " Cartwright?
Cartwright"!
Just like that.
Nobody came up.
I hang up.
Well, was it for Costanza or?
Yes, yes, that's it.
Nobody answered.
Was it a woman?
Yes, yes.
I tell her you not here.
She said curse word.
I hang up.
She called.
He yelled, " Cartwright".
I missed her.
Who's Cartwright?
I'm Cartwright.
- You're not Cartwright.
- Of course I'm not Cartwright!
Why don't you two go to the movies by yourselves.
I'm not in the mood.
Well, me either.
I'm going to Sky Burger.
- So you're not going?
- You don't need us.
Well, I can't go to a bad movie by myself.
What, am I gonna make sarcastic remarks to strangers?
I guess I'll just go to my uncle's.
- Should we tell him we're leaving?
- What for?
Let's just get out of here.
Seinfeld, four!
Hunger will make people do amazing things.
I mean, the proof of that is cannibalism.
Cannibalism.
What?
What do they say?
I mean, they're eating, you know.
"This is good.
Who is this?
I like this person".
You know, I mean I would think the hardest thing about being a cannibal is trying to get some really deep sleep.
You know what I mean?
I would think you'd be like: "What was that?
Who's there?
Who's there?
Is somebody there?
What do you want?
What do you want?
You look hungry.
Are you hungry?
Get out of here".
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
I'm not a foodie.
I don't: "Oh, this is too rare.
Oh, it's too salty".
Just eat it and shut up.
I'll eat anywhere, whatever they're having.
I've eaten rolls off of room-service trays in hotel hallways.
I have.
That's not a joke.
This is my life.
I don't know, somebody left it.
Why would somebody poison a roll and leave it in the hallway for some comic coming down at 2:00 in the morning?
Why would they do that?
Sometimes you go to a restaurant, they put the check in a little book.
What is this, the story of the bill?
"Once upon a time, there were some very hungry people".
What is this?
Little gold tassel hanging down.
Am I graduating from the restaurant?
What is this about?
You want some of mine?
- Take some of mine.
- Why do I get pesto?
Why do I think I'll like it?
I keep trying to like it.
- Like I have to like it.
- Who said you have to like it?
Everybody likes pesto.
You walk into a restaurant, that's all you hear.
Pesto.
Pesto.
- I don't like pesto.
- Where was pesto 1 0 years ago?
Look at that guy.
I'll bet you he's getting hair transplants.
Anytime you see a guy that age wearing a baseball cap, 1 0-1, plugs.
The thing about that painting is with the colours and Oh, yeah, plugola.
One more thing about the car.
Let it warm up for a minute.
Yeah, that's a tough minute.
It's like waiting in the shower for the conditioner to work.
I don't understand why he couldn't take a cab.
- Who?
- Elaine is having a houseguest.
She's picking him up at the airport tonight.
- A guy?
- Yes, it's a guy.
He's from Yakima, right?
- Seattle.
- Everybody's moving to Seattle.
It's the pesto of cities.
So?
Well, you tell.
Well, from what I can piece together, our friend here met a gentleman - Ed.
- Who was in town on a business venture, and?
We shared an interpersonal experience.
- Go on.
- So they went out a few times but, apparently, when the fellow returned home he discovered that the Benes tattoo does not wash off so easily.
On some people.
So he's coming to stay with her for a week.
It was just gonna be a weekend, but then, somehow, it became a week.
- Wait a second.
- All right, okay.
- All right, all right, okay.
- What happened?
Oh, the busboy left the menu a little close to the candle.
I'm sorry for the disturbance.
- I'm never eating here again.
- Yeah.
- Nice going.
- Thank you.
- That ought to get us a free dessert.
- Yeah.
I think the busboy's in trouble.
Did I get him in trouble because of what I said?
I just told him what happened.
He didn't do it on purpose.
He pointed at me.
- Why did they point at me?
- I said I would never eat here again but he had to know I was kidding.
I didn't say anything.
I can't believe it.
He's going.
He's fired.
- Oh, I said it in a kidding way.
- I didn't know he'd get fired.
He'll probably kill his family over this.
What if he's waiting for me outside?
He pointed at me.
Did you see him point?
Lot of ex-cons become busboys.
They seem to gravitate towards it.
- Was it my fault?
- Was it my fault?
Maybe I'll try that pesto.
Look, I feel bad for him too, but he'll get another job.
Let's face it, it's not a profession where you embellish your rásumá and undergo a series of gruelling interviews.
- Like you really know busboys.
- Oh, like you do.
- Hey, at least I was a camp waiter.
- Camp.
It was a fat camp.
Those kids depended on me.
- Elaine?
- Yeah.
Busboys are always changing jobs.
That's the business.
I know, I work with these guys.
I talk with them in the kitchens at the comedy clubs.
Why don't you get him another job?
I'd love to.
But I don't know anything about him.
He could walk around the street pricking people with pins.
I don't know if you people are aware of this but I am one clever chickadee.
What, did you get the busboy's number?
His phone's been disconnected, but I was able to obtain an address.
apartment 4D.
Now, I did my job.
- May I have the car keys, please?
- How did you get all this?
Does the word "charm" mean anything to you?
No.
Now you're going to his apartment?
I think this is nuts.
I'd like to apologize.
I wanna tell him I didn't mean to get him in trouble.
- So you're going now?
- Yeah.
I'm gonna see if there's anything I can do.
Get him another job.
Maybe I'll hear of something.
Maybe the fat camp.
- You're not going?
- I would but I have to pick up Ed at the airport.
I just don't think you should go alone.
- Can't you wait till after my set?
- It will take too long.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Take the K-Man.
A little support.
- I don't - What?
What?
Take me where?
Where?
Look, I really appreciate your coming but if you wouldn't mind try not to say too much.
What am I gonna say?
I don't know.
Well, I'm not an idiot.
Certainly not.
Then we're cool.
Yeah.
Yeah, we're cool.
I'm sorry to bother you.
I was in the restaurant earlier and I was wondering if I could talk to you about what happened.
Thanks.
I hope I'm not interrupting anything.
It's just that I think I may have, without realizing it been responsible for getting you fired.
And I just I wanted you to know that I did not intend for that to happen.
He's a hell of a guy.
This is a guy I know.
Kramer.
Oh, my God.
Waterbed?
Anyway, I I just wanted to let you know that I'm really sorry that happened.
And if I can help out in any way, I'll certainly be glad to do that.
Well, I guess that's about it.
You got anything to drink?
- We really should be going.
- Let me get a glass of water.
Hurry up.
Paquita?
Paquita?
His cat's gone.
Who left the door open?
Who left the door open?
Come on!
Come on!
Help me look!
You know, the cats, they run away all the time.
You know, my aunt, she had a cat, ran away, showed up three years later.
You never know.
They got things in their brains.
They remember where they're from.
Unless somebody starts feeding her.
See, that's what you gotta worry about.
Once again, Antonio, I can't even begin to say how deeply, deeply sorry I am about everything.
The job the cat The lamp.
There's wire sticking out.
Yeah.
Here's my card.
I'm in real estate.
So if you're ever looking for something bigger, something nicer Maybe not right away.
Anyway You ought to get that wire fixed.
I got the door.
George, stop worrying about this guy.
It wasn't your fault.
Come on.
He's not stalking you.
- Hey.
- Hey.
He doesn't even know where you live.
Who told you to give him your business card?
That's Elaine.
Kramer.
George wants to know when you wanna go look for the cat again.
Well, it's been a week.
It's up to the cat now.
Kramer says it's up to the cat now.
It'll be on your conscience.
- Oh, how do you figure?
- How do you figure?
You're the one who left the door open.
Why was I in charge of closing the door?
Why was he in charge of closing the door?
Because you came in after him.
- So?
- So?
- Last person in should close the door.
- Let me talk to him.
Talk Call him from your house.
He's calling you now.
Okay.
Ed's downstairs.
Can I have the car keys?
- No " hello"?
- You got any aspirin?
Hello.
Now, lookit, you guarantee me this car's gonna get me to the airport tomorrow, no problem?
Guarantee?
Hey, it's a car.
Because if there's even the slightest chance of any problem I don't wanna take it.
If I don't get this guy on a plane to Seattle and out of my life, I'm gonna kill him and anyone who tries to stop me.
So did you have a nice week together?
I heard a little ping in the car last time.
What was that ping?
There's no ping.
Why are you so wacky?
Jerry, you cannot imagine how much I hate this guy.
And he hasn't even done anything.
It's this situation.
He's a wonderful guy, but I hate his guts.
So have you two been?
No!
I told him I've been having my period the last five days.
And I'm sleeping all squished over on the edge of my bed.
But I've only got 1 4 hours to go, and nothing can go wrong now.
I've taken care of everything.
I've confirmed the plane reservation checked weather - What's your airport route?
I got it all mapped out.
I'm taking the tunnel.
What about the Van Wyck?
I spoke to a cab driver.
For 5 bucks, he turned me onto the Rockaway Boulevard shortcut.
Now look, his plane leaves at 1 0: 1 5, we're getting up at about 8.
- Gives us enough time, right?
- You still using that alarm clock?
No, I bought a new one today.
It's got everything.
If you oversleep, a hand comes out and slaps you in the face.
Flying doesn't make me nervous.
Driving to the airport can make you very nervous.
Because when you're flying, getting on a plane if you miss that plane, there's no alternative.
On the ground, you have options.
You have buses, you have taxis, you have trains.
But when you're taking a flight, if you miss it, that's it.
No airline goes, "Well, you missed the flight.
We do have a cannon leaving in 1 0 minutes.
Would you be interested in that?
It's not a direct cannon.
You have to change cannons after you land".
"Sir, where are you going, Chicago?
Oh, Dallas.
All right.
Wait a second.
Dallas, that's about Dallas.
Texas, anyway.
You should hit Texas.
Ready?
Get out of the net immediately because we shoot the luggage in right after you".
Get up.
The alarm didn't go off.
You're gonna miss the plane, it's 9: 1 5.
- 9: 1 5?
- Yeah.
It's 9: 1 5!
We'll never make it.
I'll leave tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
Are you crazy?
No.
Now, now, let's go.
Let's go.
You get dressed, you get dressed.
- Can I shower?
- Shower?
Are you out of your mind?
I gotta shower.
I'll feel dirty all day.
Forget the shower.
The shower's out.
Just move it.
Put your clothes on.
- Where are you going?
- The kitchen.
- The kitchen?
- Got a bag of cashews in there.
No, they're not making it.
Here, put your pants on.
- Put your pants on.
- What's the big deal?
- I'll go tomorrow or the next day.
- No, you have your ticket.
- You have to go now.
- We'll never make it.
- Don't say that.
- Well, it takes 45 minutes to get It takes 45 minutes to get there.
That will only leave me five minutes to get to the plane.
- Shut up and pack!
And what if I don't make the plane?
You'll have left.
Then what do I do?
You're talking too much.
- Where's my sweater?
- What?
- My brown sweater.
- What sweater?
- My brown sweater.
- You didn't bring a brown sweater.
- I got a brown sweater.
- Here.
You want a sweater?
You want a brown sweater, you got a brown sweater.
- I can't take your sweater.
- It's brown!
What are you doing?
No.
There's no time for folding, no time for folding.
I think that's it.
- My shoes, you packed my shoes.
- Shoes?
Shoes?
Shoes weren't invented till the fourth century.
People walked around for thousands of years without them!
I have this!
Let's go.
Let's go.
- Anywhere in the city?
- Anywhere in the city.
I'll tell you the best public toilet.
Okay 54th and Sixth.
Sperry-Rand building, Mention my name, she'll give you the key.
All right, 65th and 1 0th.
Are you kidding?
Lincoln Center, Alice Tully Hall, the Met.
Magnificent facilities.
I never knew I could drive like that.
I was going faster than I've ever gone before.
And yet it all seemed to be happening in slow motion.
I was seeing three and four moves ahead weaving in and out of lanes like an Olympic skier on a gold-medal run.
I knew I was challenging the very laws of physics.
At Queens Boulevard, I took the shoulder.
At Jewel Avenue, I used the median.
I had it.
I was there.
And then I hit the Van Wyck.
They say no one's ever beaten the Van Wyck but, gentlemen, I tell you this: I came as close as anyone ever has.
And if it hadn't been for that five-car pileup on Rockaway Boulevard that numbskull would be on a plane for Seattle right now instead of looking for a parking space downstairs.
- You did everything.
- You tried.
The busboy's coming.
- The busboy's coming.
- The busboy's coming?
- You don't mean here.
- I buzzed him in.
He's on his way up.
He's coming up?
I'll check you out later.
- Where are you going?
- I'm the one he wants.
- He's coming to settle the score.
- No.
You three all know each other.
There's no point in me getting involved at this stage.
No, he's not gonna do anything.
I guarantee it.
The hell with it!
Let him kill me, l Antonio!
Antonio, in here.
Hey, Antonio, how's it going?
Three nights ago a gas main beneath the restaurant exploded killing five people in my section including the busboy who replaced me.
If I'm not fired that night because of you and your thoughtless, stupid, insensitive remarks it would have been me.
You saved my life!
Come on.
- Yeah?
- It's Eddie.
- He's coming up.
- And the same night of the accident while looking for Paquita I find a job in a restaurant where they pay me almost twice what I was making before.
And, when I returned to the apartment Paquita, perhaps frightened from the explosion had miraculously returned.
Well now I must go, for today I am starting my new, wonderful job and I am very late.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you all.
Hey, watch where you're going.
You almost knocked my head off.
Why don't you watch where you're going, okay?
- Because you bumped into me.
- Who do you think you're talking to?
Hey, get your hands off me!
You go to hell!
He'll get another job.
He's a busboy.
It won't be for a while.
At least not till after the cast comes off.
That fall down the stairs, that's what did it.
That's not how it happened.
It's when he fell on him with his knee.
That was awful.
Poor Antonio.
Thanks.
So, much longer?
Till when?
Till he goes back to Seattle or till he can feed himself?
I guess it's not important.
Take care of yourselves.
I should probably get going too.
If I don't feed Paquita by 7, she goes all over everything.
Take it easy.
Yeah.
How you doing?
First of all, I can't believe that people actually do fight.
People have fistfights in life.
I can't really believe that we have boxing, either.
It's really an amazing thing.
The problem with boxing, you have two guys having a fight that have no prior argument.
Why don't they have the boxers come into the ring in little cars drive around a bit, have a little accident, they get out: " Didn't you see my signal?
Look at that fender"!
Then you'd see a real fight.
