{START OF EPISODE 1}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
- Carla, give me a beer.
- Right.
What's the story with Sam?
Isn't he back from ltaly yet?
No.
Three whole days, and we haven't heard a word.
He just went there to stop Diane and Frasier from getting married.
Don't know what could be taking him so long.
Maybe Frasier's still thanking him.
I wouldn't be a bit surprised if Diane now had a "Malone" after her name.
Well, could be, Cliffie.
That ltaly's an awfully darn romantic place.
I almost went there myself on my honeymoon.
Had the plane reservations and the hotel reservations.
Everything.
Well, what stopped you, Norm?
Oh, Vera.
You know, she insisted on coming.
I bet you wanna know how it went in ltaly.
No, no, not really.
How about you, Cliffie?
Well, I'm gonna tell you anyway.
Got off the plane and I took a cab to the Marino estate, where I had been told they were gonna get married.
But they wouldn't let me in, so I jumped over the fence and landed in the middle of seven snarling rottweilers.
Rottweilers.
It comes from the German word "Rott--" - Cliff, shut up.
- Yes, sir.
Luckily, I outsmarted the dogs by diving into a moat.
While the police were fishing me out, I discovered that Diane and Frasier had decided to get married someplace else.
This was right before they threw me in jail.
Jail?
How'd you get out?
Well, a local landowner bailed me out.
Actually, he didn't bail me out.
There's a different system over there.
He purchased me.
Seems Seems his ox died or something.
I really don't wanna talk about this anymore.
I'm gonna be in my office.
Oh, yeah, one more thing.
I am through with that woman forever.
I will never think about, see or mention her ever again.
And if anyone even uses the words "Diane Chambers," I will have no other choice but to kill that person.
Wow.
Poor guy.
Who is this Diane Chambers anyhow?
Who said that?
No!
.
No!
.
No!
.
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!
What do you say, Norm?
Any cheap, tawdry thing that'll get me a beer.
- Hey, Norman.
- You seem pretty chipper today.
A few notches up from your usual abysmal.
Well, thank you, Cliffie.
That's because I have a little bit of good news here.
- What's that?
- You know how I've been trying to get Vera pregnant?
Congratulate me.
- Hey!
- Have a cigar.
Whoa.
Well, I think this calls for some champagne here.
- Well, thank you, Sam.
- What sex do you want it to be?
Sex?
Come on, I thought you just asked for the vintage.
You know?
Wait, wait.
I see your mistake.
Vera's not with child.
She just told me I didn't have to try to get her pregnant anymore.
Let's celebrate!
Come on!
Party!
This is amazing.
Hundreds of bottles.
Red and white wine glasses.
High-grade Naugahyde stool covers.
And a brass rail.
And a big-city bartender with a joke at the ready.
You from out of town?
Okay, I'll bite.
Yeah, I'm from out of town.
Can I help you?
Well, that went right over my head.
- Excuse me, my name's Woody Boyd.
- Woody.
Hi, I'm Sam Malone.
Howdy.
I'm a friend of Coach's.
Is he around?
I'm sorry, Woody.
I guess you hadn't heard.
No, Coach passed away a couple of months ago.
But, yeah, I'd like to think he's still around.
Coach, gone.
I can hardly believe it.
Well, he had a lot of friends.
I don't-- I don't remember him mentioning a Woody.
Well, we never met.
We were kind of like pen pals.
You exchanged letters?
No, pens.
It was Coach's idea.
Oh, well, that figures.
Can I get you something to drink here?
Well, a soda pop would be good.
Soda pop.
All right, all right.
See, I got in the habit of writing to the bars in the big city, in the hopes of landing a job, and once I wrote a letter to Cheers, and Coach answered my letter.
I liked him right away.
Maybe it was because he was the only one who wrote back to me.
Woody, did you say you were looking for work?
Well, actually, I came to Boston on a fact-finding tour.
See, I tend bar back home in lndiana.
Well, it's not a bar exactly.
It's more like a pigsty with a jukebox, if we had a jukebox.
Carla.
I'd like you to meet Woody Boyd.
Woody, this is Carla Tortelli.
- Hi, ma'am.
- Ma'am?
What's that supposed to mean?
I believe it's a term of respect.
No wonder it sounded so weird.
Who is this guy?
Well, he's a friend of Coach's, and he's looking for work.
What do you think?
You wanna give him a try?
Me?
Mr Malone, this is the proudest day of my life!
I'd work like a slave and I wouldn't take anything more than minimum wage.
And, of course, I'd wash your car.
And if you ever need someone to just, you know, yell at, I'm your man.
I think we better keep him, Sam.
He wouldn't be safe on the streets.
- Thanks, Carla.
- What the hell.
Woody, come on around here and we'll check you out.
You won't regret it, Mr Malone.
I love bartending.
You get behind a bar, and right away strangers are your best friends.
They call you great names, like "buddy" and "pal" and "chief" and "ace".
Here's your apron, sport.
Sport!
Another great one!
But listen, let me make one thing clear.
One mistake, and I'm out on my butt.
Hey, Cliffie, next time you try to imitate that helicopter, I think you ought to chalk up the cues before you stick them in your ears.
You kidding, Norm?
I'd look pretty silly with chalk in my ears.
Cliff, Norm, Woody Boyd.
Woody's gonna be helping us out around here.
- Hey.
- Nice to meet you.
- All right.
- What's your pleasure, gents?
Make it anything you want.
Now, where I come from, all anyone ever drinks is beer.
Beer's fine, but any monkey can pull down a tap.
Why study years to be an ace mixologist just to serve beer after beer after beer?
So, what will it be?
Beer.
Same.
So while it's a common belief that the Tyrannosaurus rex was the king of the dinosaurs, you know, as a-- As indicated by the appellative "-saurus," the smartest of the spiny reptiles was actually the thyropatroid.
Frasier W. Crane.
Oh, the man who won the hand of Diane Chambers.
Found out he had to keep the rest of her.
Hello, Carla, Norm, Cliff.
It's been a long time.
Yeah, we got a lot of catching up to do.
So, what's new?
- I couldn't begin to tell you.
- Okay, well, that's even better.
What's your pleasure?
My life is devoid of pleasure.
You need a good laugh.
Are you from out of town?
Just give me a whiskey, punk.
Punk!
Oh, that's great!
Where's Malone?
I mean, where's my good friend Sam?
Mr Malone's in his office.
You want me to give him a buzz?
No, no, I'll surprise him.
Oh, by the way, any peculiar noises you hear coming out of that room, don't let it bother you.
It's just a couple of old friends having a little fun together.
Yo.
I think my joke loosened him up a little.
Hello, Sam, old buddy.
Frasier.
What the hell are you doing here?
- Are you alone?
- Yes, I'm alone.
I didn't marry Diane.
You didn't?
No, I didn't.
Does that make you happy?
Well, I'm happy for you.
Just how'd you manage that?
Well, she left me at the altar.
I had just vowed to take her for my wife.
The priest asked her if she would marry me.
She looked around and asked if he was talking to her.
He nodded, and she was gone.
Gee, Fras, that's tough.
She just took off, huh?
No explanation or anything?
Well, there was no explanation necessary.
It was you she loved all along.
And it was the thought of you that made me lose her.
The story of my humiliation spread like wildfire through the university and then to the entire ltalian countryside.
Everyone knew about it.
Everyone knew about my shame.
- You must have been imagining that.
- Oh, was l?
Do you know that in soccer, when a player kicks at the ball, misses and falls down, it's now called a "Frasier"?
That could be a coincidence.
If he's knocked cold, it's called a "Frasier Crane".
I've lost everything, Malone.
My tenure, my practice and my Diane.
My life is ruined, and it's all your fault.
Now, don't you think someone should pay for that?
If by "someone," you mean someone in this room, I can I can honestly answer no, I don't.
Oh, come on.
Oh, wait-- What are you doing?
The gun's not even loaded.
- Certainly it's loaded.
- No, it isn't.
Of course you know it's not, because Frasier Crane is a harmless person.
He never caused you a moment's concern, not a moment's worry.
He was never a threat to your relationship with Diane, and he's not a threat now.
Is that it, Sam?
No, it's just the little holes there are empty.
Once again, you're ahead of me, Sam.
I just hoped to see you quaking in your boots a little bit or something, but you've cheated me even of that.
Boy.
Boy, you're really bent out of shape over this, aren't you?
Just out of totally idle curiosity, whatever did happen to Diane?
Well, I was recently informed by my mentor, Dr Bennett Ludlow, whose care I'm now under, incidentally.
And believe me, he's doing a heck of a job.
He told me that she's at St. Anselm's Abbey, an hour outside of Boston, with the Sisters of the Divine Severity.
Oh, whoa, whoa, wait.
You can't be a nun if you've already-- Oh, she's not becoming a nun, you idiot!
She's working there.
She's cleaning, serving meals, wearing sackcloth, - that sort of thing.
- I'll be damned.
You see, after she left me, Diane embarked upon a spree of decadence in ltaly.
I'd hear stories about dancing on tables in caf√©s, swimming in public fountains, cavorting with counts and soccer players.
Well, now she's doing penance for la dolce vita.
She's seeking peace.
I hope she's found it.
Diane, dancing on tabletops?
You mean my--?
Your--?
Our--?
The Diane?
Yes, all of them.
But now listen, Sam, - you won't go and see her will you?
- No!
I mean, it would be disaster for everyone.
No, no.
Believe me, I wouldn't do that.
No, I'm over her.
You know, and if you know what's good for you, I think you should forget about her too.
Oh, I'll forget about her.
I'll forget about her when the moon turns to ashes and the birds sing nevermore.
There you go.
Well, I'm sorry about the histrionics, Sam.
- Oh, no, don't.
- You know, it's funny, even through all this, I still think of you as my goombah.
Well, it's best that I get going.
But let's do the lunch thing sometime.
I'd like that.
Yeah.
Take care.
You won't go see her?
No way.
No.
- Hi, Diane.
- Hi, Sam.
Calm-- Calm down, here.
I just popped in to say howdy.
Are you okay?
What the hell--?
Heck are you doing here?
I bumped into Frasier, and he told me that you checked into a convent, and I was afraid you got all squirrelly again.
Thank you for your carefully worded concern, - Well, now, you know-- - but I assure you, I am fine.
Oh, Sam, I was so sorry to hear about the Coach.
Yeah, I know, I know.
Not a day goes by when I don't miss him terribly.
Me too.
You know what helps me, though, is I always remember what he used to say about the afterlife, "l hope there are not a lot of stairs".
- It's wise in its way.
- Yeah.
Sam, you're really gonna have to leave.
It's wrong for you to be here.
All right, but there's something I gotta say first, though.
All right, fine.
But if they find you, it's your problem.
- All right.
- I'm not covering for you.
Sister Catherine!
Have you met the rice inspector?
The rice inspector sent by the archdiocese to inspect the rice, which is what they do.
Ah, yes, very good.
Sam, what is it?
Tell me what you have to say and then leave, please.
Listen, I want you to come back to Cheers.
I don't think you belong here, Diane.
No, Sam, I do belong here.
Although I'm not of their order, the sisters took me in, and working here among them has helped me find the peace that had so eluded me.
Besides, if I came back to Cheers, it would lead to nothing but terrible problems between you and me.
No, no, it's not like that anymore.
Because all I feel for you is the concern of a friend.
The same way I would for, say, Norm or a dog.
You say that, but you know our passions always overcome our intentions.
We say it's over, and yet we still end up in each other's arms, hugging, then kissing, perhaps lightly at first but then with open mouths hungry, probing tongues Go on, please.
I appreciate the offer, Sam, but I'm needed here, and I need to be here and I need to be needed here.
- You really mean this, don't you?
- Yes, I do.
Well, I guess that's what matters.
I guess I better be going.
I recognised one of the ladies, and I think that I'm the reason why she's here in the first place.
I'm glad I got to see you.
Yeah, I'm glad I came.
Turned out kind of nice, huh?
Yes, it was good.
I'm glad we had a chance to end it this way.
Cleanly, spiritually.
Free of rancour and sexual tens-- Tens-- Tension.
Whatever.
- Well, this is where it ends, huh?
- Yeah.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
I swore I'd never tell you this ever, but I guess maybe because we're never gonna see each other again You know, you always used to accuse me of being an unromantic slob, but you wanna know the truth?
When you called me to tell me that you were marrying Frasier, I flew on a plane to ltaly to stop the wedding.
I guess I thought I was in love with you and that you and l should be married.
Not that I feel that way now.
But, well, I just thought you ought to know that.
Have a good life.
Bye.
Good evening.
Good-- Good evening, Sister Marie.
I heard that the rice inspector was here.
He wasn't the rice inspector.
He was a man from my past.
Say no more.
There's no need to explain.
- I feel I must.
- I knew you would.
He wanted me to return to the outside, to the life I used to know.
By the way, I hope you like this.
I got a little creative tonight.
- Oh, yet again.
- Taste it.
At any rate, I told him that I wasn't going to leave, that I'm needed too much here.
Do you think I am, Sister?
I mean, I feel that I'm ready now to leave, to get on with my life, but I feel so safe here.
What do you think?
Put your faith in God.
I know I'm going to.
Time to do the floors.
These ladies can be so messy.
Rice everywhere.
I haven't done this since I was a child but when in Rome Now, I know there are far greater problems in the world than mine, but I'm feeling as though I'm at a crossroads.
And I was wondering if you could give me a little sign to tell me what to do.
Excuse me.
Hi.
You wouldn't know where a men's room was around here, would you?
Sam, would you put a men's room in a convent?
Right now I would, yes.
Just any sign.
Something-- Oh!
Oh!
Well it's not the parting of the Red Sea.
That's nitpicking.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
- Oh, no.
- What's wrong, Mr Peterson?
It's my anniversary, I have nothing for Vera, and stores are closed.
Normie's in big trouble now.
Will Mrs Peterson give you the cold shoulder?
It's not the cold shoulder I mind.
It's the hard knee.
Well, not to worry there, Norm.
I think with your wit and resourcefulness, you'll come up with a suitable gift.
Yeah.
You're absolutely right, Cliffie.
I tried.
I'm doomed.
I know where there's a gas station open.
Why don't you get her a can of 40-weight.
- Very funny.
- Hey, why not give her the best gift of all, Mr Peterson?
A night of romance.
Carla, where's that gas station at?
Come on.
Come on, Norm.
You can do better than that.
- What?
- That ashtray's better than that.
Come on, man.
Ashtray, huh?
It's a little shoddy, but You know, with a nice pack of cigarettes or something, a nice snappy new pack of matches, I think we got something here.
- Hey, hey, hey, Norm!
- Does Vera even smoke?
Oh, yeah, she's been known to smoke.
Occasionally after sex.
Usually during.
Well, not the best I've had, but it'll serve.
Refill, Sam.
Frasier, I'm not sure how to get into this, but your bar bill's up to 500 dollars.
My God.
Really?
I'm shocked.
Well, I promised myself that if I reached 500 dollars, I'd quit.
So that does it.
I'll raise my limit to 1,000.
I hope you understand it's just business, but 500's a little out of my comfort zone there.
Oh, I understand, Sam.
Seems nobody wants to pay a man for sitting around and drinking all day.
Yeah, it's a world gone mad, huh, Fras?
Sam, I've come to a very important decision.
I've just taken stock of myself.
It's not exactly AT&T, is it?
I'm gonna pick up the pieces of my shattered life.
But in order to do that, you gotta hit rock bottom first.
For you, that's three flights up.
Carla, you wanna see if anyone in the back has open wounds to salt?
Spoilsport.
- Sam, you are my inspiration.
- Well, thank you.
You, too, were a worthless, drooling drunk.
Carla, hold it a second.
Sam, I'm sorry.
See, the point is that you pulled yourself together.
I have to rebuild my life, my career, my reputation, my self-esteem.
I'm no longer worthy to practice psychiatry, but I'm gonna make myself worthy.
I'll start at the lowest, most menial level.
- Sam, who sweeps the floors here?
- Me and Woody.
Mostly Woody.
All right, Woody.
Well, let me do it for both of you.
- You can pay me whatever you'd like.
- Oh, gee, Frasier.
I don't know.
No, Sam, I know you think it's beneath me, but I really need this now.
No, no, I just don't know where Woody put the broom.
Maybe if you try in the back closet there.
I mean, it's okay with me, but you sure you want Diane to see this?
Yes.
Let her confront her guilt for what she's wrought by her refusal to work out our relationship.
And if I have a scintilla of psychological acumen left, when she sees my humiliation, she'll eat her liver.
What's Frasier doing?
Well, he's the new janitor.
Poor Frasier.
I had no idea he'd take it so hard.
This is my saddest romantic legacy.
But I refuse to hold myself responsible.
Do I beg men to fall in love with me?
I certainly hope not.
I'd like to think I was special.
Have you made any friends since you moved to Boston?
A few, if you count cats.
You're really cute.
I'd love to have a friend like you.
Look, Sam.
Could we be in on the inception of a budding romance?
You talking about a foursome here?
How can you make a sweet, innocent flirtation into something tawdry?
I could tell you, but it'd be a lot more fun to show you.
So, Woody, maybe we could go out for coffee after you get off work.
Oh, gee, Lisa, I'd like to, but I gotta - I gotta do something else.
- What?
I don't know, but I gotta start right now.
Excuse me.
My God.
I don't think I've ever seen a man Woody's age so painfully shy around women.
That young lady asked him out.
He refused her.
- Two beers, Sam.
- Well, maybe Maybe she came on too strong.
Some guys don't like that.
Well, I know how the lad feels.
I mean, in the mating ritual, I like to be the aggressor.
Of course, I don't mind a woman giving me a clear signal that I caught her eye.
You mean like sticking a finger down her throat?
Woody hasn't had a date since he came to work here.
Well, look, later on tonight, I'm gonna go cruising for chicks, a popular pastime among virile studs of today.
I'll take Woody along.
There's not a man yet that's come back from a Clavin love safari without some trophy to hang on his game-room wall.
Especially the horns, you know.
Hey, Woody.
Lookit, later on, I'm going out scouting for chickereenios.
- You wanna come?
- Well, sure.
What is that, some kind of cereal?
I'm not sure, but I think he means girls.
Yeah, that's right.
Come on, Wood.
Look, I got this great pickup line.
We pull up next to this cute-looking babe, right?
I say, "Hey, my friend likes you".
Yeah, and if that doesn't work, Cliff throws an egg at her.
It's great.
That sounds like swell times, but I'm not much in the mood for it.
Thanks.
Woody, would you mind if I stuck my big fat nose in your affairs?
Stick your big fat nose wherever you like, Miss Chambers.
There's no need to hide your feelings.
You're afraid of ladies rejecting you, aren't you?
No, it's not so much that.
It's just that Well, I got this problem.
What problem?
We at Cheers always share our problems.
Besides, we kind of ran out of things to talk about, so we'd appreciate it.
All right.
There's this girl back home named Beth Curtis, and she is the most wonderful girl in the world.
We dated ever since we were kids, but last year we split up.
You know, I wanted to travel around and see the world.
She wanted to stay in lndiana.
At first I thought it would be okay but now I just can't seem to get her out of my mind.
Everything I do, everywhere I go, everything I see reminds me of her.
Beth.
Poor kid, huh?
Oh, wait a second.
Was that your meddling "hmm"?
Oh, Sam, we have to get those two back together.
There's nothing sadder than a man who wants his maiden and is denied her.
It tears my heart out.
Frasier.
You're getting dirt on my new Joan & Davids.
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!
What do you say to a beer, Normie?
Hi, sailor.
New in town?
Where's Diane?
Back from the airport yet?
No, no, not yet.
What's Diane doing down at the airport?
Well, we all got together and thought it'd be kind of fun to get Woody's girlfriend out here and surprise him.
She's still picking her up.
What do you mean, "we all got together"?
I didn't all get together.
Did you, Norm?
Yeah.
Yeah, it was a good meeting, actually.
Had some hors d'oeuvres.
It kind of turned into a little party, you know.
Well, you might have invited me.
Oh, we might have, but we wanted to enjoy ourselves.
- Hey, Fras, how's the job going, bud?
- Oh, great.
Yeah, I hear you're really cleaning up in your new business.
At least I was invited to the party.
Great rumaki, Sam.
Everyone, this is Beth Curtis.
- Hi, Beth.
- Hi, everybody.
How you doing?
Sam Malone.
I guess-- I guess Woody told you all about me.
I haven't spoken to Woody in ages.
That's all right.
What could he tell you that you can't see?
Sam, please.
I'd really like to thank whoever all's responsible for bringing me out here.
- Yeah.
Cliff Clavin, do-gooder.
- Hi.
Gosh, I can't believe how big this city is.
Yeah, yeah, quite a place.
You know, Boston is the hub of Boston proper, which comprises some-- There's probably, what, two and three-quarter million people spread out in 83 cities and towns.
Get out of here.
You question my figures?
No, I want you to get out of here.
So where's my butterball?
- You mean Woody?
- Yeah.
He doesn't mind me calling him that.
He's not very sensitive about his weight.
Woody's not fat, Beth.
He was the last time I saw him.
- Wow.
He lost weight too?
- Too?
Yeah.
I don't like to brag or anything, but I just lost 50 pounds.
I don't think Woody will even recognise me.
Beth, that's wonderful.
Norman, isn't that wonderful?
Yeah, it's great.
Great.
You know, actually, I just lost a little weight recently myself.
No, I just found it.
Beth?
You shrunk.
I shrunk?
Look at you.
Wow, my hands can touch.
This is a dream come true.
What are you doing here?
- Well, your friends brought me out.
- They did?
Thanks, guys.
You've been so good to me.
In fact, next to the Twilley brothers back home, you're the closest friends I have.
Woody, after you left, both Twilley brothers made improper advances to me.
Hey, that makes you my closest friends.
Woody, why don't you take the rest of the day off.
Oh, really?
Thanks, Sam.
- Look at you.
I can't believe it.
- I can't believe it either.
You know, in high school, we were voted the couple most likely to explode.
Hey, I'll show you the sights.
What do you wanna see first?
I'd kind of like to get a bite.
Didn't you eat on the plane?
Yeah, but not enough, I guess, because I'm kind of hungry again.
Yeah, I'm famished.
See you later.
Do you find that strange?
The first thing they wanted to do was eat?
Yeah, yeah, Woody just got back from lunch too.
Yeah, I'll say it's strange.
If I hadn't seen my girl in that long, I know what the first thing on her mind would be.
"How did he find me in Tibet"?
Sam, I finally did it.
It took three days, but I removed every trace of Carla's number from the men's room.
Would you mind your own business?
Frasier, for God's sake, hasn't this gone on long enough?
If you're trying to make me feel guilty, you succeeded.
Don't flatter yourself, Your Highness.
I'm working here because I enjoy it.
The Crane family is no stranger to hard work.
When my ancestors first came to this country, they had nothing but strong backs, a dream of freedom and a small personal fortune.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have a life to live.
Sam, where do you keep the Jonny Mop?
Sam, stop him.
Don't let him put on this stupid display.
Well, sweetheart, I'm helping him regain his self-respect.
Besides, people come here specifically to see the sweeping psychiatrist.
Sorry I'm late.
Beth and I had to go to Baskin-Robbins for the changing of the flavours.
Woody, how are you and Beth getting along?
Oh, great.
We had this wonderful breakfast this morning.
Pancakes and sausages and hash browns.
And then we discovered this great little treat.
You know how when you get to the end of a meal and you find something to kind of top it off?
- You mean like a sorbet?
- No, like eggs Benedict.
It really hit the spot.
Woody, that's kind of like topping off a steak dinner with pork chops.
- Great idea.
- Well, it's not original.
It's the Hungry Heifer Carnivore Platter.
Woody, it's none of my business, but aren't you and Beth worried that you might put back on some of the weight you worked so hard to take off?
No, we're very careful.
We always stop eating before we get lightheaded.
Oh, who am I kidding?
It's happening all over again.
I swore after I took that 1 00 pounds off that I'd never tub out again.
Now I'm gonna have to send home for my fat clothes.
I don't know what comes over us when we get together.
You know, Woody, I thought of something.
I have old drinking buddies I can't be around without wanting a drink.
Automatic thing.
I think that maybe Beth is-- Well, she's like your old eating buddy.
- Very good, Sam.
- Well, thank you.
And just when we were about to hang a "for rent" sign on Sam's forehead.
He's right, Woody.
Friends with whom we share a common vice sometimes reinforce our behaviour.
I'm sure that's what's happening in your case.
Thank you, amateur psychologists for your simple-minded diagnostic attempts.
Now, Woody, tell me, do you come from a strict moral upbringing?
- What do you mean by that?
- Well, do you and Beth feel that premarital relations are wrong?
Well, I don't wanna talk about it.
Beth and I feel there's some things you just don't talk about.
- Like what?
- I don't know.
We never talk about it.
Now listen to me, Woody.
As healthy but moral human beings, you and Beth sublimated your lust into the sensual pleasure of eating.
As your fondness grew, so did your appetites.
Well, in short, food became your substitute for sex.
Vera became mine.
You really think that's what it is, Dr Crane?
Yes, it's quite common.
Well, for example, when Diane left Sam, and he started drinking again, he was filling the void that Diane left.
And Diane filled her emptiness by toying with and destroying a man who's her cultural and intellectual superior in every way!
You see the point I'm trying to make, Woody.
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- I rest my case.
Go rest your mouth.
Hey.
You mean to tell me you've never slept with Beth?
Well, it's simple, then.
You sleep with her, you stop eating.
What a great reason too.
I mean, as if you needed one.
Sam, I can't do that.
I can't ask a nice girl like Beth to sleep with me out of wedlock.
The younger generation.
I just don't know what to say to them.
Why don't you just marry her?
I don't think we're ready for marriage yet.
Forget Frasier's Freudian rantings.
As anyone will tell you, I am a Skinnerian behaviourist.
I say we must address your symptoms.
You and Beth must learn to retrain your eating habits together.
We've thought about diets before.
All it does is make us hungrier.
Well, then I'll help.
I'll take you out to dinner and show you how to eat a light but satisfying meal.
Oh, well, I'll try anything.
Hey, Sam, you wanna join us?
Well, Sam could join us if he so desires.
We'll have a sparse but nutritious meal and a lot of delightful conversation.
Thanks, Diane, but I got something a little more fun planned for myself.
I'm gonna go home, shave my head with a cheese grater while chewing on tinfoil.
How about tomorrow night?
- Wasn't it good?
- Yeah.
Sam, can I tempt you with the last piece of broccoli?
Depends on what you're gonna do with it.
Aren't we just the trendsetters?
It's not everyone that could walk into an elite French restaurant and order nothing but vegetables.
Yeah, I gotta admit, I don't feel as full as if I had eaten food or something.
Really, Diane, we appreciate what you're trying to do, but what do you say we cleanse our palate with some √©clairs?
Yo, waiter!
Yes, a sense of humour's very important when dieting.
But remember, this one meal isn't going to change your lives.
You're going to have to continue this way on your own.
You think we can, Woody?
Oh, sure.
Yeah, this was kind of nice.
You know, I usually feel so full I can't really do anything.
- But now l - I know.
I feel a lot more energetic.
You know, I've been thinking about what the janitor at Cheers said about sublimation.
About what?
Well, he said that, for us, eating took the place of Woody, maybe you should go over to that table over there so you can be heard above Sam's termite impression.
Yeah, that might be better.
I'm sorry.
Eating took the place of what?
Well, you know, that subject that you don't like to talk about.
What subject don't I like to talk about?
You know, that subject that you never talk about.
The reason we never talk about that is because you don't wanna talk about it.
I don't mind talking about it.
In fact, I think about it all the time.
Well, I don't mind talking about it either.
- In fact, I think about it too.
- You think about it too?
Then maybe we should talk about it.
Yeah, I think we should talk about it.
You don't suppose there's a chance we're not talking about the same thing.
- No.
- No.
Well, I think we've talked about it enough.
Me too.
Well, I think we're gonna be shoving off.
Where are you going?
We don't wanna talk about it.
- I think I understand.
- Yeah.
Understand what?
Oh, yeah, right.
Probably gonna get something to eat, right?
Don't be silly.
- lsn't it beautiful?
- What's that?
Two people in love.
Yeah, you said it, all right.
- What?
- I just had the funniest stray thought.
Remember the first tryst you and I shared?
Yeah, I think I had Cheez Whiz on my half.
I'm talking about making love.
I know.
Yeah, of course I remember.
It was It was great, wasn't it?
It was wonderful.
Yeah, I think we gave new meaning to the word "cooking".
Sometimes I thought it would go on forever.
Hey, I came pretty darn close a couple of times, didn't l?
That's not what I meant.
You were wonderful.
Yeah, you were pretty wonderful yourself.
- It can be so wonderful, can't it, Sam?
- You bet.
Thank God there's no danger of all of that starting up again.
Right.
We know what kind of hell that would lead to.
Amen.
Will there be anything else?
- I want two of these.
Keep it coming.
- Make it three.
I think the word is "chocolate".
I want more chocolate.
That's it.
Go away.
Go away.
We must come back.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Hey, Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
- Great game.
- Yeah.
Hey, look, they're showing chicks in the stands every-- Oh, look at that one.
Come to papa!
Oh, yeah, Cliffie, they didn't build that stadium in Foxboro for nothing, pal.
They sure didn't.
I'll bet it cost millions.
I suppose you're wondering why a person of my breeding would be working among the lumpen proletariat.
Do you mind?
I'm researching a novel, and working here gives me insight into their simple pleasures.
Oh, wait, wait.
They're zooming in on a cheerleader here.
I think I've zoomed in on that one myself.
This language supplies the rich texture that distinguished Fitzgerald's work.
Cliffie, here comes the wave.
Well, you have to go along with them, or they get testy.
That's good.
Good.
Seeing Baryshnikov dance Giselle was the experience of a lifetime.
When he took the stage in his cabriole, it was breathtaking.
- I'd never seen his Albrecht before.
- You mean he split his tights?
I wish.
Hey, Diane, you got a minute?
Listen, I want you to know that you are the last person on earth that I would ask for help.
But I figure you've been in college for a zillion years, so you must have picked up something.
- Now that you've buttered me up - Well, my kid Gino, he made this generator for his school science fair, - and he can't get it to work.
- What's the problem?
He's not very smart.
Here, take a look at this thing.
If you're asking me to do Gino's homework for him, I won't.
It's unethical.
- Hey, Mrs T?
- What?
You know, you ought to ask Mr Clavin.
He's very sharp.
He's got more information in his whole head than I got in my little finger.
- You got that backwards.
- See?
Oh, yeah, Carla, it is common knowledge that I'm scientifically handy.
As a matter of fact, I spent a good part of my youth in a laboratory.
And you'd still be there today if the chimpanzee hadn't taught you how to open your cage.
Hey.
Will you look at that?
One of those new marital aids, huh?
Okay, Clavin, the science fair is in one week.
This is your chance to either gain my respect or lose your tonsils.
Hey, well, thanks for the opportunity, Carla.
So, Norm, what do you say?
You wanna give me a hand here?
No.
I think I'll pass, Dr Frankenstein.
Cliff, have one on the house here for your good deed.
Oh, thank you, Sammy.
What about one for lgor?
Sam, who's sitting here?
I don't know, but his coat's been taking up bar space all night.
So I've noticed.
Cashmere.
Very nice.
Hand stitching.
Tortoiseshell buttons.
This is a very expensive garment.
Doesn't look that expensive to me.
It has a Bemberg lining.
Oh, well, no fair, now.
You didn't mention that.
I'm gonna hang it up.
Oh, a pipe smoker.
I don't believe it's a domestic blend.
Sam, what do you think?
- I don't smell anything.
- Of course not.
Your olfactory senses have been destroyed by that cologne you marinate in.
Oh, I should've known.
Of course, it's a perique blend.
Jack Meechan, my father's partner, used to smoke it.
The memory's so clearly etched in my mind.
He'd sit in his office smoking his pipe.
I'd beg to sit in his lap, and he'd say, "Okay, little miss, but you have to pay the toll first".
So I'd give him a big hug, and then he'd ask, "How about a tip for the gatekeeper"?
So I'd give him a peck on the cheek, and he'd toss me in the air, yelling, "Who's your favourite uncle"?
And I'd squeal, "Uncle Jack, Uncle Jack".
Was this before or after you met me?
This is weird.
What are you making a big deal about the coat for?
I was merely trying to conjure up an image of the owner.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Fantasy's healthy.
Everybody does it.
Didn't you ever fantasize about me?
Yeah, I guess I did.
And I you.
What did you fantasize about?
Mostly that you'd stop using phrases like, "And I you".
Okay, Watson, fire up.
Cliffie, are you all right?
It went right from my neck to my lower regions, Norm.
- Anything we can do?
- Yeah.
Crank it up again.
Woody, would you add up these receipts for me, please?
Sure.
There's eight of them.
Thank you, Woody.
That's what I got too.
Hey, Sam, this guy never came back for his coat.
Probably saw Diane sniffing it.
- Night, all.
- Night, Woody.
- Okay, Sam, lost and found.
- Give me that.
Maybe there's some identification.
No wallet.
Well, there must be some clue here.
You see?
Two tickets to the Grand Kabuki.
So he likes to watch two fat guys with diapers butt heads.
- What's that tell you?
- That you're an idiot.
You're confusing sumo wrestling with classic Japanese theatre.
Gee, please don't tell the guys.
A dried rose.
What a romantic.
Could it be a memento from a golden midi d'amour in some sylvan setting?
What's that?
A classy way of saying a nooner?
Boy, you're really losing it here.
You know, you can't tell what a guy's like by what he's got in his pocket.
I certainly can.
What do you have in your pockets?
Why don't you check it out yourself and you tell me.
I think my point is made.
Has it occurred to you this guy may look like Jo-Jo the Dog-Faced Boy?
I can tell you right now that the owner of this coat could well be the most attractive man I've ever encountered, whatever he looks like.
Down, girl, down.
What a person looks like has nothing to do with who that person is.
If my face were transposed on another soul, would it matter?
To the poor sap who got it, it would.
Cheers.
Oh, well, hold on a sec.
I'll check.
Have we seen a cashmere coat with Bemberg lining around here?
Sam.
Yeah, why don't you talk to our coat-check girl.
The dream man for Miss Chambers.
Hello.
My name is Diane Chambers, and I want you to rest assured that your lovely coat is safe in my charge.
I think we have a bad connection.
Your car phone?
You know, I imagined you had a car phone.
Well, what I meant was, is we were playing this game, wondering what you'd be like based on your coat.
Me?
Well, close your eyes and imagine.
Oh, no, don't.
We don't want you rear-ending a bus.
Oh, forgive my merry sense of humour.
I get it from my mother's side.
- Oh, my God.
- He sounds wonderful.
Really?
Well, why don't you ask him out, then.
Yes.
Listen, you sound like a charming man.
If it's not too forward, perhaps we could go for an espresso sometime?
Sometime?
Now, there's a commitment for you.
On second thought, I'm getting off work now.
If you're not busy, we could do it tonight.
Oh, we're both such spontaneous madcaps, aren't we?
You're right down the block?
Momentarily, then.
Making a date with a stranger over the telephone is a big mistake, Diane.
I tried it.
It was nothing but trouble.
Of course, mine was an obscene phone call.
I hope this works out.
Busted expectations are a real bummer.
- I won't be disappointed.
- No, no, I was talking about him.
Hey, hey, hey.
Here comes Mr Right down the steps as we speak.
Socks.
He's already got my guy beat.
- What, are you nervous there?
- Not at all.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- I bet you're the guy without the coat.
- Yes, I am.
Diane?
You should be so lucky.
Diane.
Aren't you going to introduce yourself to this lovely gentleman?
Of course I am.
I was just waiting for the proper moment.
I'm Diane Chambers.
How do you do?
Welcome to Cheers.
I'm Stuart Sorenson.
- Well.
- Yes.
- Oh, good, you have my coat.
- Ah, yes.
I can't tell you how grateful I am for you taking such good care of it.
Oh, it was my pleasure.
It's a lovely garment.
Did you get it on the Continent?
- France.
- "The Continent".
Nice try, Diane.
Hi, Stuart, I'm Sam Malone.
I haven't seen you in here before, have l?
Well, I'm new to the Boston area.
I'm in the midst of restoring a carriage house on Beacon Hill.
And I needed a break, so I just wandered in here.
- It's a nice little pub you have.
- Well, thank you.
- That makes you a carpenter, huh?
- Sam, he's probably an architect.
- Why, yes, I am an architect.
- An architect, you say?
- Did you hear that, Sam?
- Three times.
Listen, Diane, about that date, I realise we made it over the phone and-- Well, here's your chance to back out.
This lady's not going to let you off that easily.
But it was a nice try there, Stuart.
Do you know a place still open for espresso?
As a matter of fact, I know a wonderful little bo√Æte.
Every time I go there, I'm reminded of the Caf√© Lumi√®re, opposite the Bois de Boulogne.
I know exactly the one you're talking about.
It's in the lobby of the H√¥tel Sainte-C√©cile.
- Yes.
- Well.
That's the only place I stay when I'm in Paris.
Oh, I'm sorry.
That sounded so pretentious.
There's my car phone.
That sounded pretentious too.
Oh, hell, so I'm pretentious.
- Do you mind if I go get that?
- Not at all.
I'll meet you at your car.
There's a back way out of here.
You gotta shinny up a drainpipe, crawl over some broken glass, but I think it may be worth it.
What are you talking about?
I feel totally vindicated.
He's everything I thought he would be.
He's charming, intelligent, self-deprecating.
I didn't hear "attractive" in there.
- I find him attractive.
- Oh, come on, Diane.
On a scale of one to ten, me being a 12, of course, where are you gonna rate Stuart?
Let's change that to lQ.
While your score would remain 12 his would skyrocket.
It's too bad you're not gonna be gazing across the table at his lQ.
Why don't you just admit you're jealous.
All right, I am.
You're right, but can you blame me?
Sam, are you saying what I think you're saying?
You bet I am.
I'd kill for a car phone.
Two vodka tonics.
- So where's the stick?
- She and Stuart are on another date.
They went to see a play.
I think it's a whodunit.
With him in the audience, it's a what-is-it.
Hey, hey, come on.
Lighten up on him, will you?
He turned out to be kind of a nice fella.
Gonna have to give Diane credit on this one.
Her intuition proved to be right.
I'm a great believer in intuition.
It's like when I first saw you, Sam.
Something told me you were super smooth with the ladies.
Maybe it was that time you walked out of here with four of them, one on each arm.
You know, you always just seem to know the right moves.
Sometimes I like to just stand around and watch you operate.
- It's like going to school.
- I never really thought of it like that.
Well, yes, I have.
Well, so there we were, me and 25 soaking wet Japanese architects in my apartment, and I'm out of Brie.
Oh, Stuart, what a life you've led.
Make yourself comfortable.
I'll get our drinks.
Hey, Stuart, how was the theatre?
- Great fun, Sam.
- Oh, good.
Hey, Miss Chambers?
I've been meaning to tell you, I really like your friend Stuart.
Oh, thank you, Woody.
Hey, you think you could get him to do that great trick for me?
What trick?
The one Sam says he does when he makes the clock stop by looking at it.
Wasn't that just supposed to be between you, me and the lamppost?
Well, look at her.
It's an easy mistake.
Excuse me.
I have to speak with Sam.
I'll be back before the bouquet leaves the glasses.
Might I speak with you briefly?
You might, but I don't think you will.
I'm sorry about that clock comment.
I made it before I realised what a nice guy he is.
I'm such a pooh.
- Beg your pardon?
- You heard me.
A pooh.
After all these years, I have to admit it.
I'm all talk.
Oh, well, of course you are, honey, but we've all gotten used to that.
Sam, I have spent the week with a person who can converse on a multitude of subjects, who listens when I talk, who treats me with respect.
And a person with whom I can think of nothing but, "Why aren't you great-looking"?
Or, "Why can't I stop wishing you were great-looking"?
This is probably not the right time to say I told you so, so if you could just remind me to get to it later.
Oh, Sam.
I'm small and vain and petty.
Will you stop being hard on yourself?
I mean, that's my job here.
Come on.
You had, what, few casual dates with him?
What's the big deal?
Yes, but as often happens in my life, this gentleman is becoming much too serious, much too fast.
He's wearing that smitten look I know so well.
I've got to do something before it goes any further.
Uh-huh, I see.
For the first time in my life I can't bring myself to tell the truth to a man so I need a lie.
And God forgive me, I'm coming to you for help.
Well, I'm flattered.
All right, let me Let me give this a little thought here.
All right.
All right, I've never passed this one on before, but I think it's-- I think it's the ticket here.
It's neat, fast, clean and, best of all, it makes them want to get away from you.
Now, here's what you do.
You tell him that you have a contagious skin condition and that insanity runs in your family.
Very sensitive.
Well, thank you.
It's a gift.
Sam, I have never been more grateful to you than I am now.
I just looked into the face of insensitivity and dishonesty, and it made me blanch.
I am going out there, and I'm going to break up with Stuart.
But I'm going to do it honestly, straightforwardly and yet, caringly.
I'll tell him the truth of my feelings, that I'm not attracted to him romantically, although I am very attracted to him as a friend.
And I'll say it in a way that he will accept and understand and be grateful for.
Do you even begin to understand what I'm trying to say?
Everything except the part where you changed your name to Blanche.
Goodbye, Sam.
Goodbye, Blanche.
Thank you.
- Listen, Stuart-- - Diane, I'm sorry.
I can't put this off any longer.
There's something I have to tell you.
Diane, for the first time in my life, I'm thinking of making a permanent commitment with a woman.
Stuart, I have a contagious skin disease and insanity runs in my family.
My God, Diane, I'm terribly sorry to hear that.
Thank you.
I thought you should know.
Well, that makes me feel a little selfish, talking about my good news after hearing that.
Your good news?
Diane, what I'm trying to say is there's someone else.
She's someone I knew before I met you.
I honestly thought it was over between us, but-- Well, we spoke earlier today, and we decided to work things through.
You're telling the truth, aren't you, Stuart?
Well, that's the most wonderful thing I ever heard.
It's tearing me apart inside.
I'm a total wreck.
Don't give up hope, Diane.
No relationship is guaranteed.
Except yours.
Don't you doubt for a moment.
- We're talking ironclad here.
- Well, thank you.
By the way, have you seen a doctor about that condition of yours?
What con--?
Oh, yes, yes.
I'm seeing a wonderful man.
He's almost cleared it up completely.
He's about got that insanity thing licked too.
He's a skin and brain man.
It's a new specialty.
Sounds fascinating.
Well, Diane, I'm really glad we had this chance to know each other.
Me too.
- Goodbye, Diane.
- Goodbye, Stuart.
Hey, congratulations.
You're free and clear.
Don't congratulate me.
He's a terrific guy.
And I cast him aside because of his appearance.
I'm greatly ashamed.
Well, from where I was sitting, it sounded like he was-- All right, Sam, let's not split hairs.
The point is, he's gone.
For the first time ever, I let appearance taint my feelings toward a man.
Boy, you know what's wrong with you?
You just can't be honest with yourself.
Looks are all that ever mattered to you.
What are you talking about?
That is utterly inaccurate.
Oh, yeah?
Want me to prove it to you?
Yes.
Who were you more crazy about than anyone else in your entire life?
Not including yourself there.
Don't answer.
It was me.
And there was only one reason why you ever went out with me, and that was because of my looks.
- Not entirely.
- Yes, entirely.
Name one other reason why anyone would go out with me.
Go on, name one.
You can't, can you?
No, Sam, I can't.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Hey, Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
Hey, everybody, I got a letter from my dog.
Pretty spiffy handwriting for a dog.
Well, it's not actually from my dog.
My mom writes the letters as if they're from my dog, Truman.
Weird beyond imagination, Norm.
Listen to this:.
"Dear Woody, Boy, what a great day I had.
I pulled all the laundry off the line, chewed up your father's bowling shoes, and grabbed a Yankee pot roast off the table.
Yum, yum".
Isn't that cute?
The mutt eats better than I do.
"By the way, now that you're not here to keep me in line, your mother's thinking about putting me to sleep.
I certainly wouldn't blame her, and I don't want you to either after I'm gone".
Sam, cover me.
I gotta make a phone call.
- Drinks are up.
- Right away.
I need a vodka Gibson, up, a bloody mary, a Johnnie Walker black, two Beck's, and change for a 20.
- Change for a 20, Sam.
- Damn!
Carla's been on the phone for two hours here.
She probably got an obscene phone call and won't let him off.
Okay, five, ten, ten, 20.
Can you believe it, Sam?
How far I've come?
Right before your eyes, I've turned into a waitressing machine.
Even in this pandemonium, I have everything perfectly under control.
There you go.
And here's your change for the 20.
Thank you.
See what I mean?
Always sit at her station.
Did you hear that, Sam?
Still busy.
Sam, I've got to get home and start preparing for that interview for the part-time job.
What interview?
You know, the teaching assistant at the college.
Oh, right.
All right, go on, take off.
Woody and l will take care of you here.
Listen, don't fall in that same trap you did with Sumner.
Sam, my intimate relationship with Sumner had nothing to do with the fact that I was his teaching assistant.
Sumner took advantage of a naive young coed.
I have learned since then, from bitter experience.
I am older, wiser, and I have a lot more units under my belt.
Hey, Woody, give me a refill, would you?
Coming up.
You know, Mr. Peterson, you're amazing.
How do you keep putting them away?
Well, it's all done with mirrors, son.
I just never look in one.
- Hey, everybody.
- Hey.
Buckle your seatbelts and get ready for a blast into the unknown.
I've got a phenomenon here which, well, I'm sure will inspire the legendary Jack Palance to utter the infamous words, "Believe it or not".
Get a load of this.
- What's that?
- Potato, right?
It's no ordinary, common, garden-variety russet, Norm.
Though, I'm proud to say, I did grow it myself.
It's the spitting image of Richard Milhous Nixon.
Look.
What, you find this amusing?
No.
No, I find it historically significant, Cliff.
Look, look at the eye.
Well, all right, forget about the third one there, but look at those eyes.
The ski-jump nose, the jowls, huh?
He's even got a little bit of sweat there on the upper lip.
Come on, man.
All right, maybe this will help you out.
I am not a crook.
Sorry, it still doesn't look like Nixon.
Sure sounds like him though.
Hi, guys.
Hey, Carla, I got a potato here looks just like Richard Nixon.
Big deal.
Find one that doesn't, then get back to me.
We were really hopping around here a couple hours ago, you know.
So why didn't you call me sooner?
I tried to, but your phone was busy.
Oh, sorry.
My oldest must have been talking to his girlfriend.
- Where's Diane anyway?
- Oh, I gave her the night off.
She's trying to interview for a TA job down at the college.
She'll never get it.
She's a big A with no Ts.
So Anthony has got himself a girlfriend, huh?
It's sickening, Sam.
Everyday it's, "Annie this.
Annie that".
Walks around the apartment all moony-eyed.
I think my kid's turned into a weenie.
Well, don't be too hard on the lad, Carla.
You know, men will do some pretty strange things to have a woman by their side.
In your case, inflate one.
You know who I hold responsible for this?
Nick.
- Who's Nick?
- He's Anthony's father.
His biological father.
Wow, a scientist.
You know, what my boy needs now is just a little adult male companionship to snap him out of this.
How about it, Sam?
Come on, find somebody else.
Call Nick.
Come on.
You know Nick's idea of fatherhood: When the egg splits, so does he.
- Come on.
- What exactly would I have to do?
Just take him out and show him a great time, you know?
A real night on the town.
Wild, crazy, borderline illegal.
I guess I could handle that.
Yeah, why not?
It's about time the kid learned how much fun it was to play the field.
- Right.
- Hey, wait just a second here.
Let's not give marriage a bad rap, huh?
It's a fine institution.
Matter of fact, go ahead and ask any single man here if he wouldn't gladly trade places with me for a night.
Anybody?
Please.
One night.
Oh, come on, fellas.
I'm offering transportation and a hot meal.
No, no, this is second-term Nixon.
Yeah.
Yeah, this tater is definitely showing the strain of Watergate here.
Not--?
Not newsworthy?
Oh, well, excuse me for living there, buddy boy.
Yeah, I'll call you back when my potato marries a rock star!
New York Times, my foot!
If the news doesn't come out of Moscow, they're not interested.
Hey, what do you think?
You like the game?
Yeah, that was great.
Where's your phone, Sammo?
Oh, come on, give her a break, will you?
You called her four times tonight.
She's probably half asleep.
Cheers.
Just a minute.
Who you looking for?
Some girl wants to talk to the outlaw of love.
She tracked me down.
Hey, hey, that's Annie.
That's Annie.
Let me have it.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
He's fine, Annie, and he'll call you tomorrow.
Yes, he's still a hunk.
Okay, I will.
Good night.
I owe you one, Sam.
Anthony, consider yourself kissed good night.
Okay, you want that root beer, huh?
Great.
That's me and Annie's favourite.
She loves it when I make it come out my nose.
Yeah, I know.
That always works for me too.
Listen, Anthony -I know you like Annie a lot-- - Oh, no.
I love her.
Anthony, there's only two times a man uses that word: tennis, and when he's already paid for the room.
You know what I mean?
My ma, she says the same thing.
She acts like we're kids or something.
I'll tell you, just between you and me-- I mean, you don't tell my ma.
Me and Annie, we're talking about getting married.
- What?
You get her pregnant?
- Oh, she ain't pregnant!
We think that sex before marriage is a sin.
Afterwards, it's just one more damn thing to take your pants off for, you know?
Anthony, you don't know what you're doing.
I mean, look at me, will you?
I'm single.
I've got a great life going here.
Look, most guys go through their entire life with only one woman.
- Yeah.
- I got three under Q. This whole book is women?
This book and my life.
Tell you what pick a name, any name.
I'm gonna show you what a no-strings good time I got at my fingertips here.
Go ahead.
Any name.
- Beth Hollister.
- Beth Hollister.
All right.
Very good choice.
It's a toll call, but it's worth it.
Hey, Beth?
Hi, it's Sam Malone.
Yeah.
Yeah, well, I know it's been a long time.
That's why I'm calling.
I thought maybe we'd get together tonight.
Oh, no.
Well, is it something you can put off until later?
No, no, no.
No, I wouldn't want you to miss your first Weight Watchers meeting.
Tomorrow?
Me?
Well God, Beth, I think my appendix just burst.
Will you excuse me?
Being single means you gotta think fast on your feet.
Go ahead.
Pick another name.
Any name.
- Candy.
Candy Simpson.
- Candy Simpson.
Come to Papa.
All right.
You're good, kid.
Then again, so is Candy.
Hi, is Candy in?
Candy.
Sam Malone.
Yeah, you remember me?
Yeah, all right.
You still into hot fudge sundaes for breakfast?
You're not?
Oh, hell, I'm on the wrong page here.
Listen what I want-- What I want to say here, Candy is I want you.
Yeah.
Well, there you go.
Will you excuse me for a minute?
This is getting kind of hot.
I'm gonna take this in my office.
Woody, you wanna hang that up?
Just make yourself comfortable there.
That guy's got a great life, doesn't he?
Great?
He's got no one to come home to, nobody to care about, and no reason to even get up in the morning.
And he drives a Corvette.
This looks excellent, Miss Chambers.
I'd have to say, on the basis of this r√©sum√©, that you're my leading candidate.
Oh, I can't tell you how thrilled I am.
I think you're the best in your department, and I'd love to work with you.
Well, good.
Now, I do have to interview a couple of people tomorrow, but I'll be letting you know anon.
Terribly good to hear the King's English.
- Thank you for coming.
- Oh, my pleasure.
Oh, by the way, I got an excellent recommendation for you.
- Recommendation?
- From Sumner Sloane.
He's a colleague of mine.
You used to work for him, right?
That's right.
How nice of him.
Lovely man, Sumner.
He gave you very high marks.
- Well, goodbye.
- Bye-bye.
High marks?
What exactly did you mean by that?
Well, among other things, that you have an unbridled enthusiasm.
I see.
Goodbye.
I'm a little unclear on "enthusiasm".
Well, enthusiasm: That you don't mind taking on extra duties and working overtime, if necessary.
Of course that's what he meant.
What else could he mean?
Goodbye.
I will not sleep with you!
What?
Oh, my God, I can't believe I said that.
I think that concludes our interview.
Dr Moffat, I'm terribly sorry.
I didn't for a moment mean to imply that you want to have sex with me.
I'm sure that's the farthest thing from your mind.
Not that you don't have a healthy interest in sex.
I'm sure you think about it all the time.
Well, not all the time.
You're not obsessed.
But when it comes to sex, I'm sure you could hold your own with a man half your age.
That's not to say that you like young men.
Or any men.
Not that any man wouldn't be happy to have you.
As would any woman.
Except me.
Although, I could be.
But I'm not.
But that's not saying that I couldn't be.
This just isn't the time or the place or the circumstance.
But by that, I'm certainly not saying that you're flabby.
Why did I say that?
This isn't going well, is it?
Okay.
All right, everybody.
Open your eyes.
What's--?
What's so funny?
A blue suit with a brown tie?
Well, hey, I did the best I could, you know.
It's not easy coming up with a Ken doll on short notice.
I wonder if you guys realize how limited his wardrobe is.
Now, Barbie's is much more extensive.
She's got her own car, little high heels.
Cliff.
Listen to me, Cliff.
You're my best friend, okay?
If the situation were reversed, I'd want you to say this to me.
You've gone completely off the deep end.
You've always been kind of a weird guy, but this is just a little bit too much.
I want you to look what you've done and think about this, Cliff.
You've knocked the head off a doll and put a potato in its place.
And you actually want people to, like, come and know this.
Well, yeah, I guess you're right, Normie.
Yeah.
Been taking it a little bit too seriously.
I've been under some strain lately and It's okay, it's okay.
Thanks.
You know, thanks for pulling in those reins and saying, "Whoa, Paint, you're working up a froth".
Hey, how's Anthony doing, Carla?
I hope he didn't break little Annie's heart.
But then again, he did see life in the Sammy lane.
Oh, how do you do that?
How do you make your eyes shake like that?
Anthony's talking about getting married!
I don't know what happened after he left here, but up until that point, Annie had "Destination Dump City" written all over her.
Yeah, well, he said he'd only been thinking about getting married until last night when you changed his mind.
No way did he want to end up, and I quote, "A lonely old skirt-chaser like Sam".
Blasphemy.
What did you tell my kid, huh?
Well, basically, why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?
Well, I'll tell you why.
Companionship, warmth on a cold night, someone to share your old age with.
You think he should marry her?
I thought we were talking about a cow.
- Hey, Ma!
- Hello, Mrs Tortelli.
Vixen.
- Nice to see you too.
- What are you doing here?
Look, Ma, I don't like us being all mad at each other.
You know I love you.
So let's be buds.
What do you want?
I don't want nothing.
Except for you to sign this consent form, Ma.
Consent?
You want me to sign a consent form?
Yeah.
Annie's parents already agreed to sign it, Ma.
Sure, no problem.
I'll sign a consent form.
This is my new way of signing my name.
- Ma!
- No!
You're only 16.
You were pregnant when you were 16.
Yeah, but I wasn't stupid enough to be married.
Come on, Anthony.
Let's just take the bus to Jersey to see your old man.
You only need one parent's permission.
Oh, forget him.
My father's a bum.
Hey, don't you talk about your father that way.
- Okay, he's a sleazy bum.
- That's better.
But I'll tell you this, Ma: If I don't get your consent, I'll get his, because one way or another, I am marrying Annie.
And I was hoping that I could have Annie as my lovely wife and still keep my mother.
Ma, don't make me make a choice.
Come on, Anthony, you don't mean that.
He's a proud man, Mrs Tortelli.
I guess that's why I love him more than any man I've ever known.
Isn't she great, Ma?
Yeah.
I'm not losing a son, I'm gaining your face.
You're not making any points here, Ma.
- What am I supposed to do, Sam?
- Just calm down.
I gotta stop this.
I can't believe they're serious.
I can't believe that any son of Nick Tortelli would even think about getting married without a bun in some oven.
Sam, Sammy!
That is the answer!
Listen, listen.
Anthony is a Tortelli man, right?
Now, all Tortelli men are scum.
Ergo, given time, his eye will wander, and the rest of his slimy body will follow.
Come on, Mrs Tortelli, we haven't got all day.
I have to clean my room before dinner.
I just don't see what your hurry is.
I mean, why don't you two have a little engagement period, huh?
I'll tell you what, I'll make a deal with you.
Give me two weeks.
What do you mean?
You two stay totally apart.
Don't see each other, don't talk to each other, don't send messages for two weeks.
Then, at that time, if you still want to get married, I'll give you my blessing.
- That's all we have to do?
- That's all?
I'll die.
Our burning love will keep you alive, Anthony.
I don't know.
What's the matter, Anthony?
You afraid?
Listen, if you don't think your love is strong enough-- Oh, no, no.
We ain't afraid of nothing.
Okay, you got it.
But we come back here in two weeks and we're even more sure.
And after that we'll be together, forever and ever.
You mean like through eternity?
No, like through the weekend, momar.
I'm gonna be heartsick missing you.
That is the most childish, unsanitary thing I've ever seen in my life.
Boy, I'll say.
Don't they realize that gum is a breeding ground for cooties?
Anthony, would you get away from the window?
You're fogging up the glass with your lovesick breath.
Don't be such a grump, Ma.
I warned you my feelings wouldn't change.
Not in two weeks, not in two years.
You blew it.
I'm dead meat, Sam.
I thought you had this figured out, logically.
Yeah, well, he never went out of the damn house.
How's he supposed to have his head turned by another woman if he never saw one?
He just locked himself in a room, and he never came out except for hot meals and cold showers.
So you gonna sign the consent?
What else can I do?
They kept their end of the bargain.
- Anthony!
- Annie!
Sinuses, Carla.
Well, Mrs Tortelli, it's been two weeks.
I think it's still clear that Anthony and l are very much in love and wanna get married.
Right, Anthony?
That's right.
Here's the form, Ma.
You said you would sign it.
You're too damn young, Anthony.
Please, this is the worst mistake anybody could make.
Believe me, I made it.
You gave your word.
Yeah, I did, didn't l?
Hey, hurry it up, Annie.
I'm double-parked.
We'll be right there.
Won't this be great, Anthony?
You and me together for all time.
Yeah, that's great.
Who is that?
Oh, that's my cousin, Gabrielle.
Gabrielle, my fianc√©.
Will you hurry it up and sign?
We haven't got all day.
Hey, Gabrielle, it's nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
You're even cuter than Annie said.
How come I haven't met you before?
I've been at cheerleading school.
Hey, when are we having your cousin over for dinner?
Let's say we get married first.
Then we'll discuss the dinner guests.
Yeah, well, my word is my word.
I guess I'd better be signing this document so you two can be alone together forever.
What's your hurry, Ma?
Why don't you buds have a root beer?
I'm gonna help Gabrielle find a parking space.
- I'm worried about her.
- Anthony!
Hey, just get off my back.
This will take two minutes.
Nag, nag, nag.
Gabrielle, you ever have a hot fudge sundae for breakfast?
- They're not coming back, are they?
- Nope.
Gee, and I got 50 boy cousins who can drive.
It was bound to happen.
Pretty smart, Mrs Tortelli.
Let me fill you in on something, Annie.
There are three things that you can say about Tortelli men: One, they draw women like flies.
Two, they treat women like flies.
Three, their brains are in their flies.
Yeah, one more thing: They throw away the best women.
You know, for a loser, you're not bad.
Ditto, Mrs T.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
Okay, guys, time's almost up.
How do they expect you to form words with all the letters mixed up like that?
- That's the point of the game, Woody.
- Hey, Sam, where's Diane?
She's been burning the midnight oil, studying for exams.
I'm letting her catch a few winks in the office.
She couldn't catch winks if she walked naked through a troop train.
Say, I wonder if she's dreaming about me.
Fat chance.
That's it, time's up.
What do you got?
You first.
I've got "reap," "pear" and "ear".
Well, I'm sorry, Woody.
I got those too, so it cancels yours out.
But I've also got "flork," "ferd" and "snot".
Come on, man, there's no such word as "flork".
What are you talking about?
You know those little flags on the mailboxes?
What do you think holds them on?
Gee, Mr Clavin, you're so smart I don't even know why I bother playing with you.
You always win.
You know what I say, Woody?
You just gotta be tenacious, just like the great horned "muren".
Hey, well, besides, you almost beat me in the last game.
Yeah, just missed by a cat's "pleck".
Yep.
Boy, that's some storm out there tonight, huh, Mr Clavin?
Well, to the layman perhaps, Woody.
But in my profession we have a saying: "Neither rain nor sleet nor gloom of night shall stay this courier from the swift completion of his appointed rounds".
Cliff, my car is stalled outside.
How about getting me your jumper cables?
What, and catch my death?
Hit the bricks.
Appreciate it.
Sam, table six wants a bottle of the house red.
Woody, would you mind going down to the wine cellar - and getting some more, please?
- Of course not.
You know, I used to be afraid of the dark, but I got myself over it.
Oh, yeah?
How'd you do that?
Oh, well, I just shut my eyes and pretended it wasn't there.
Wine cellar?
Since when have we had a wine cellar?
Vodka rocks, please.
On your day off, I had a couple of workers checking the plumbing, and they discovered that there was a staircase behind the wall in the closet there.
That's amazing.
You mean it's just been there all this time?
Yeah.
A long time ago, when this was just a private house here, the owners used to keep their crazy old grandmother down there.
They say that if you're real quiet, you can hear her chains rattle.
Supposedly, she swore to seek vengeance on blond waitresses.
Very funny.
- Evening, everybody.
- Norm!
- Norman.
- Still pouring, Norm?
That's funny.
I was about to ask you the same thing.
Hey, some storm, huh?
Yeah.
If I don't get home to Vera soon, that road's gonna be closed.
Say about another half hour or so ought to do it.
Hey, Sam, where's the paper?
I wanna see what they say about the storm.
Woody had it a minute ago.
Where is he anyway?
Better go check on him.
It's been a whole week since I taught him how to climb stairs.
- Oh, here it is.
Wait a minute.
- I'll take that, Sammy.
I told Vera I'd check for double coupons.
Oh, Norman, that's very sweet.
Yeah, you know, Diane, marriage is a full-time job.
Oh, hey, Diane.
Remember that lunatic that tried to strangle you while you were doing that scene from Othello up there?
Oh, yeah, what was his name?
Andy Schroeder?
- There he is.
- What about him?
It says here that he escaped from the state-- - Whoa, she does remember him.
- Yeah.
Anyway, it says here he could be dangerous.
I don't know.
Hey, hey, come on, Normie, what's it say about the storm?
Sam, didn't you hear that?
Andy-Andy, the man who tried to kill me, is loose.
Hey, calm down.
No lunatic's gonna go out on a night like this.
He'd have to be nuts.
Boy, I hope my new wine cellar stays dry.
Where are those guys anyway?
- I'll go investigate for you, Sammy.
- Thank you.
Yeah, I've been anxious to check out your salon de vin anyway.
Hey, look, if I'm any more than five minutes, send down some cheese and crackers, huh?
Kind of a spooky night, huh?
Sam, how can you be so calm knowing this man is free?
You've never taken him seriously.
Just because he smiles at you with that pink-cheeked, round kewpie doll face and says, "Hi there," you think he's harmless.
Well, he's not.
He's a cold-blooded homicidal maniac.
Hey, no guy is gonna walk in here into this brightly lit bar and attack you.
- Probably not in a dark one either.
- Oh, Sam!
What?
Now, come on, everybody, just relax here.
I got candles now.
That's right, everybody, just keep calm, all right?
I mean, no reason to panic here.
Sammy, those taps operate when the power is out, don't they?
Why haven't the others come up from the wine cellar?
They sure have a knack for picking the wrong time - to goof off, don't they?
- All right, I'll go roust those guys out.
Or else I'll just have to bury their bodies.
All right, that's it.
I'm calling the power company.
God, Sam, the phone is dead.
Oh, you're kidding.
Wow, no phone, no power.
Cut off from the outside world on a stormy night with a homicidal maniac on the loose.
Isn't that always just the way?
God, that was Norman!
- What's happening?
- Oh, come on, whoa!
You are such a sucker.
Don't you see what's happening?
They know you found out about Andy, and they're just trying to scare you to death.
Why don't you go down there and just get it over with?
I'm gonna go check the fuse box.
Oh, of course that's it.
Oh, I am such a goose.
What should I expect from this devilish crew?
Here I come.
I'm opening the door.
Oh, I hope nobody's down here.
Because it sure would scare me if people yelled out a bloodcurdling boo.
Well, looks like the candle is in on your little joke too.
Why won't this light?
Hi there.
What?
What?
Oh, God.
I just had the worst nightmare of my entire life.
By the way, Sam, you were beastly to me.
Oh, really?
Well, how was l?
You weren't in it.
Of course.
Beastly?
Can you be specific?
- All right.
- Sam, l-- I don't think Diane's dreams are anything you should be meddling in.
Maybe you're right.
Starring in them is enough, I guess.
You were having another one of those dreams, weren't you?
Yes.
But it wasn't as bad this time.
Diane, you've got to stop this nonsense about Andy-Andy.
You've been dreaming about him for months now, since you found out he was released from the state mental hospital.
Can you blame me?
The man tried to kill me, Frasier.
Look, Diane.
Listen, I've-- I've talked with him.
You what?
Yes, as soon as you started having those dreams, I found out where Andy was living, and I went to see him.
I wanted to learn if your fears were unfounded, and, believe me, they are, Diane.
I've counselled him for several weeks now, and his progress has been remarkable.
Frasier, I don't believe this.
I want you to confront this fear.
I mean, just talk to the man.
Never.
Never, never, never!
Diane, I sense resistance.
Diane, I heard screams.
Oh, well, I dreamt I was being murdered.
Was I the one who was murdering you?
- No.
- Was I helping in any way?
Sam, I'm still a bit shaken up.
May I have the rest - of the evening off, please?
- You bet.
Thank you.
She came in, she fell asleep, and now she's going home.
Diane, what you need now is a little TLC.
Tender, loving Crane.
Well, thanks anyway.
I'm sure I'll be fine.
After that nightmare, maybe now I can sleep through the night without being haunted by that homicidal cherub.
Listen, at least let me drive you home.
When you're this close to hysteria, you need the calming influence of a strong and mature man.
Hi there.
- Diane?
- Yes.
The reason I came here is to tell you how deeply sorry I am that I hurt you.
And I also want you to know that I'm leaving the country.
And it would mean so much to me if I had your forgiveness.
Fine, you're forgiven.
Now get out.
You can wish the man bon voyage at least, for God's sake.
You're right.
Andy, I hope everything works out for the best.
- Do you really mean that?
- Yes.
Well, then maybe you can help me.
I've fallen in love with a wonderful girl, and we're going to get married.
And I'd like you to meet her.
- There's just one hitch.
- You killed her.
Hey, hey.
She-- She doesn't know about my prison background.
So I've-- I've told her a few tiny fibs.
Like I have friends and a life.
And I've adopted you people to be it.
She's coming here to meet you all, and I hope you'll back me up.
- l-- I don't know about this, Andrew.
- I disapprove.
Well, wait a second now.
If I could just throw in my two cents worth here, I really couldn't give a damn one way or the other.
Please, l-- All I'm asking is for what society promised me.
A chance to start over.
Wait a second here.
Frasier, Diane, Iet me talk to you over here for a minute, will you?
We'll be right back.
Hold on a sec.
Come here.
Come on, let's sit down over here.
Listen.
Is Andy cured, or isn't he?
Well, Sam, a trained psychiatrist never uses the term "cured".
Unless we're talking about ham.
That's pretty good.
No, to wax serious, Andy's progress has been remarkable, and, well, I'll-- I'll vouch for his stability.
Well, then I say let's help him.
I mean, we'll be giving both of them a new chance on life there.
By George, Sam, sometimes out of the mouths of babes.
No, let's not talk women now.
What do you say, huh?
I'm not so sure about this.
Well, Diane, instead of dwelling on the bad person that Andy used to be, we reinforce the good person he wants to be.
Oh, come on, loosen up, will you?
It might even be fun if you'd unclench your keister long enough.
That was pretty good.
Hey, come on.
Andy?
Andy, we're with you.
I really appreciate it.
Listen, before she gets here, let me coach you on the little lies I told her.
My God, she's early.
What am I gonna do?
Please, everybody, whatever I say, just go along.
- Trust me.
- All right.
- Andy.
- Cynthia.
- Everybody, this is Cynthia.
- Hello, Cynthia.
- Hi.
- Hi, Cynthia.
I've heard so much about you all.
Andy, I really love your bar.
Andy's bar?
Oh, you must be Sam.
Yes, that's right, I'm Sam.
I'm really glad to see you putting your life back together again.
Well, I'm-- I'm trying.
Well, I really admire Andy's philosophy on giving ex-cons a second chance.
Even a flasher.
Well, you know what they say, if you've got it, why not--?
Sam.
You must be Diane.
- lndeed I am.
- Poor, poor Diane.
Yes.
Well No, really, it's all right.
It's all right, he's told me everything.
What did he tell you?
How you so wanted to have his child.
And this, of course, is Frasier Crane.
Oh, the poor wretch you've been counselling.
Yes, he's helped me quite a bit.
I hope so.
Are you still having trouble with that little habit?
Habit?
- What little habit is that, Fras?
- Yeah, Frasier.
Do tell, do tell.
It's an illness.
He's not ashamed of it.
- Are you, Frasier?
- Oh, certainly not.
Not exactly.
Well, not entirely.
- It all depends on the-- - He's a kleptomaniac.
And not making much progress, I'm afraid.
He shoplifted his entire wardrobe.
Well, not all of it, but these pants are pretty hot.
Sam, are we having a good night?
- How much have I got in the register?
- Oh, I don't know.
It's been pretty slow.
Probably no more than about 50 bucks.
Are you kidding?
We must have 1,000 in here.
- Thank you, Woody.
- I just thought the owner should know.
I'll need the cash for my trip.
- Oh, Andy, I don't know about that.
- Oh, Sam, loosen up.
Unclench your cash register.
Listen, Andy, how about tearing up all my unpaid bar chits - as kind of a little going-away present?
- Norm, you're a good and valued customer, but I can't do that.
- Nice try there, Norm.
- Do it yourself, big guy.
- All right.
Hey.
- Hey, that's great, Andy.
- Hey, how about me, pal?
- Not a chance.
Well, it looks like you did a little better than I thought you did there, Andy.
Let's see here.
One hundred, 200-- Oh, don't bother counting it, Sam.
I'll just take it all.
Say, look at the time.
We have to fly.
Diane, baby, for old time's sake.
The man just gives and gives and gives.
Sam, take care of my bar and take care of this little gal of mine.
It was nice meeting you all.
Oh, us too.
And by the way, I love your choker.
I'm not wearing a choker.
- You will be.
- Come along there.
Bye.
Sam.
You have to stop Andy.
He's taking all your money.
He'll be back.
Just give him a chance.
Are you crazy?
He's never coming back.
I'm calling the police.
Oh, come on, l-- He's coming back, Diane.
You know, I've made jokes about your dearth of living brain cells, but it's not funny anymore.
Don't you get tired of being wrong?
- Thank you, everybody.
- Hold it a second, Andy, Diane's making a fool of herself here.
Sam, you guys made me look like a big shot in Cynthia's eyes.
You guys were wonderful.
- I'll never forget you.
- Well I'm most touched that you trusted me, Diane.
You, who had reason to fear and to hate me the most.
- Sam.
- Oh, yeah.
Goodbye.
Sam, I'm sorry, l-- Sam, wait.
How could I have been so wrong?
A lifetime of practice.
Sam?
Sam, I'm sorry.
I feel awful.
You were right.
Please accept my apology.
Oh, forget it, Diane.
I forgive you.
The quality of mercy is not strained.
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath.
It is twice blest.
It blesseth him that gives and him that takes.
Thank you, Sam.
What did you say?
I think you heard me.
Yes, but you said it.
Well, perhaps in his pithy way, Blake said it best.
Oh, yes.
And throughout eternity I forgive you, and you forgive me.
- I can't believe my ears.
- Oh, come on, Diane.
You really didn't believe that buffoonish fa√ßade that I've been perpetrating for the benefit of my blue-collar clientele, did you?
Oh, my God.
My heart is racing, Sam.
Oh, dear.
Well, I know just the thing.
Perhaps a spot of chamomile tea would calm you down.
There you go.
Please.
- Careful.
- Sam, I never found you so attractive.
Oh, well, how nice.
Listen, before we take this any further, would you mind sitting down?
I'd love to play you a little something from an opera that I've been writing.
It's-- It's based on the Old Testament.
It combines the brooding intensity of Mahler with the pesky insouciance of Poulenc, and it goes something like this.
Sam?
Sam?
Take me.
Now.
I want you.
Put the keyboard away, and let me be the instrument you play on.
- Diane?
- Yes.
Do you realize you just ended that proposition with a preposition?
Just have me.
Have me.
Oh, Diane.
Diane.
Diane, Diane?
Hey.
Sam.
This may be a silly question, but you don't have a velvet smoking jacket, do you?
Hey, come on, I'm smoking in any jacket.
- What is this?
What's going on?
- But of course.
I just had the weirdest dream.
I thought I was waking up from a dream, but I was in another dream.
Andy-Andy came back.
Oh, it was terrible.
And there was a wine cellar here.
And we all went into it.
And Frasier was a kleptomaniac, and you were smart.
When did it get weird?
Hey, Sam?
You wanna come continue this word game?
Woody's on the brink of forming a syllable.
Oh, yeah.
Whoa, wait a second.
You never told me how that dream ended.
Did you and l?
Certainly not.
Oh, well, that really was a bad dream, wasn't it?
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
- Okay, who's next?
- Make way for Norm.
Come on in, Mr Peterson, and we've got the bathroom-stuffing record.
World's record, here we come!
We did it!
Congratulations!
Drinks are on me!
The door's stuck.
It won't budge.
There's too many people in here.
Bartender must've stepped out.
Have a seat.
I gotta use the bathroom, okay?
Occupied.
Norm, we had the bathroom-stuffing championship in our grasp and blew it.
Oh, gee, I see how I miscounted.
Boy, I had myself down here twice.
See, "Woody" and "me".
Here's to noble failure, huh?
Norm, I can't drink to that.
There's nothing noble about failure.
If there was, you'd be a duke.
Hey, Diane, hold it.
Hold it.
Those aren't empty.
Sorry, guys, I'm a little distracted tonight.
Oh, yeah?
You got problems, Diane, or just the usual?
What do you mean, "the usual"?
You know, just how you usually are, you know.
How am I usually?
So you're distracted, huh?
Yes, I have to come up with $500 as quickly as possible.
What for?
Hush money for Miss Clairol?
No.
But I love the new thing that you've done with your hair, and I think you should continue washing it.
"Continue".
That was totally uncalled-for.
So what do you need 500 bucks for?
Well, are you familiar with the Farthing for Your Thoughts bookstore?
I've dallied there betimes, yeah.
Very funny, Norman.
Anyway, I was browsing there this morning when I unearthed a rare Hemingway volume.
I know what everybody's thinking: "Diane Chambers' sensibilities attuned to Hemingway"?
Wow, that's really close.
Anyway, I discovered that Hemingway's signature is in the book.
And it's priced at a laughable $500.
The owners of the store don't know what they're doing.
It's right there on the title page: "Ernest Hemingway, Madrid, 1927".
Why don't you ask that rich old lady of yours, huh?
She's got more money than me and God put together.
No, I can't ask Mummy.
- I'd rather die.
- I like that even better.
I told her long ago I was going to prove my own worth.
I refuse to go to her begging now.
Come on, Diane, she's your ma.
She carried you for nine months.
Eight.
I was premature.
Couldn't wait to get out and start yapping.
It has occurred to me that I could possibly get the money right here at Cheers.
If you can't rely on friends, who can you rely on?
I thought maybe I could ask Sam.
You bet.
He's got a lot of money.
But I don't know.
Given our past relationship, I just don't think I'd feel comfortable borrowing from him.
On the other hand, I don't know where else to turn.
Well, Miss Chambers, I'm gonna give you every bit of money I have.
- Oh, no, Woody.
I couldn't.
- No, no, I insist.
Oh, wow, that's wonderful.
I must've got my pockets picked again.
Well, welcome to the big city.
Thank you, Mr Clavin.
Woody.
- Thanks for trying to help.
- Thanks.
Well, I guess I have no choice.
Now, how best to approach Sam?
I could appeal to his generosity his good nature.
It wouldn't hurt to remind him that I'm a woman.
I'd carry a sign.
Sam?
Is now a bad time?
No, but I think it's about to be.
You goose.
Sam, would you say that our relationship has matured?
If you mean getting kind of old, yeah.
Well, you're a regular Noel Coward with a liquor license.
I don't-- I don't get it.
I'm painfully aware of that.
Sam, I know you to be a man of pride and principle, but strength is also to be found in the ability to bend.
Witness the willow, nature's strongest tree.
No, I thought the oak was the strongest tree.
Only in furniture.
What about the saying "strong as the mighty oak"?
The oak can be felled by a single harsh wind under the right circumstances.
But what about birch and mahogany?
Now, those-- Would you shut up about the damn trees?
You brought them up.
Sam, would you loan me $500, please?
Well, sure.
But I haven't even told you what it's for yet.
Well, it doesn't matter.
Use it for whatever you babes buy.
Hair curlers, clothes, sewing notions.
Whatever.
It's nothing as trivial as that.
Hey, listen.
I mean it.
It doesn't matter.
Really.
I know how hard it was for you to come in here begging like a dog for a bone.
So I'm just trying to be sensitive and not make things worse.
Thank you for making it easy for me, Sam.
This really is an extraordinary attitude.
The truth is, I've had a lot of trouble loaning people money in the past.
You know, hurt a lot of feelings.
Lost a couple of buddies once.
So I decided from now on, anybody asks me, I'm just gonna give them the money and never expect to see it again.
Oh, you'll see it again.
Diane Chambers always honours her debts.
Hey, I could care less.
Really.
You walk out that door, I'm not even gonna think about that money anymore.
- You'll see it again.
- All right.
- Thank you, Sam.
- Yeah.
You handled this even better than I expected.
But even so, it was hard to come in here and ask for this, given our past physical relationship.
Yeah, it kind of feels like you should be giving me the money, doesn't it?
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!
- Norman.
- What's the good word, Norm?
Plop, plop, fizz, fizz.
- No, not the Hungry Heifer.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
One heartburn cocktail coming up.
What's this Hungry Heifer place you guys keep talking about?
It's this terrible restaurant where Norm insists on torturing himself.
Hey, you're always giving the Hungry Heifer a bad rap.
I don't get it.
So I've had a few bad meals there.
But it's the best value in town.
Woody, their steaks come by the pound.
Wow, the steaks are that big?
No, that's where they get them.
- I'll have to try it sometime.
- Yeah, I recommend Thursday night.
That's when the chef does his tribute to swine.
Sam, two vodka tonics and a Rob Roy, please.
By the way, Sam, has Diane paid back that loan yet?
No, Carla, she hasn't.
But I could care less.
Not one dime?
It's been two weeks already, hasn't it?
Yes, Carla, it has.
But you can't expect her to pay back that kind of money overnight.
She's just a hard-working waitress.
Diane got a job as a waitress somewhere?
Sam, could you also give me change, please?
- You bet.
- Okay.
My, what a lovely sweater, Diane.
- Why, thank you, Carla.
- Is it new?
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
How nice of you to notice.
Well, how could I help but notice such a beautiful garment?
Cashmere, unless I miss my guess.
Yes, it is.
Must have cost you an arm and a leg, huh?
No, no, it was marked down 2 percent at Haute and Bothered last week.
Well, we girls deserve to splurge on ourselves once in a while.
- Don't you think, Sam?
- I could care less.
All right, I'm ready for a beer, Sam.
Hey, what's Mr Clavin doing?
You're not gonna believe this, but he's trying to get into the record book for walking backwards.
Everybody, afternoon good.
That's-- That's "good afternoon, everybody" backwards.
And you're an "assjack".
How close are you to the record, Cliff?
Well, in two days, I'll be backing myself into the history books.
Thank you, Sammy.
I think I'll just take a quick reverse strut around the old pool table, pick up some women backwards.
All right, I know you guys think that Cliff is pretty weird, but I'll say this much for him, he'll probably never reproduce.
Hey, that looks pretty good.
- You should just taste it.
- What is it?
It's lobster salad.
Lobster?
Was there a sale on that stuff?
This time of year?
Are you kidding?
- Would you like a bite?
- No, no.
No, thanks.
No, it's okay, I got too much.
I'll just end up feeding it to a cat.
No, thank you.
Thanks, anyway.
I lost my appetite here for some reason.
- She's got new shoes too.
- Who does?
You know who.
The one dribbling lobster all over her cashmere.
- I could care less.
- You know something, Sam, Diane certainly borrowed this money from the right guy.
I mean, here she is, throwing her cash around like water, and she owes you a bundle.
Most people I know would be going crazy now, especially if they knew what she spent that money on.
What do I gotta do, tell you over and over?
I don't wanna know what she spent it on.
I don't care what she spent it on.
I'm not interested in what she spent it on.
Sam, by the way, I'm gonna be a little late tomorrow.
I'm having a facial and a massage.
What did she spend it on?
A book.
- A book.
- A book.
- One book?
- One single $500 book.
And it's already been a movie.
- A book.
- Excuse me.
Would anybody like to buy some cookies?
Oh, I'd love to.
I just can't refuse.
- I'll take three boxes.
- Oh, thank you, ma'am.
And thank you.
There's a little something extra there for you.
Wow, thank you.
Oh, I just love these things.
Well, aren't you going to ask Sam if he'd like some?
Of course I am.
Care for a cookie, Sam?
Oh, don't worry, I have a lot more at home.
- Help yourself.
- Don't mind if I do.
Those are delicious.
I think I'll have a few more here.
Boy, but once you start, you just can't stop, can you?
I probably shouldn't have had that last one.
I like my cookies this way.
It takes the work out of chewing, you know?
Oh, hey, Diane, I'm so sorry about this afternoon.
I don't know what happened.
I feel like a sack of dirt.
Don't be so hard on yourself, Sam.
I'm sure you're not the first man in history to throw a frothing fit over 'Nana Doodles.
I just don't know what came over me.
I do.
Despite your assurances, you do not lend money with the sang-froid you claim.
I would like to see you in your office.
I have something I want to give you.
How about a good spanking?
I think I deserve it.
For some mysterious reason, you seem to have doubted my good intentions to pay you back.
Well, what's the mystery?
I haven't seen dime one.
Believe me, I fully intend to return all your money.
And to prove my good faith, I'm going to give you what I purchased with the $500 for you to hold as collateral until I repay you.
God, it really is a book.
It's a book, and a very valuable book.
It's a first-edition Hemingway.
The Sun Also Rises.
Oh, that's real profound.
I purchased it for $500, but I'm sure it's worth a great deal more.
It's signed by Ernest Hemingway himself.
For 500 bucks, you'd think Margaux Hemingway would come over to your house and act it out for you.
I'm taking a big risk entrusting this to you, Sam.
Please, go put it in the safe.
And whatever you do, don't let anything happen to it.
Don't touch it, don't scratch it, don't scratch with it.
Hey, you know, you really make me angry when you treat me like some kind of animal.
I'm sorry, Sam.
It won't happen again.
Just put it in the safe, please.
I'm sure there's room in there right next to your bowl of kibble.
Smells boring.
Mr Clavin, you're walking forward.
What happened to the record?
I was hours away, and I met utter defeat.
Oh, that's too bad.
Yeah, it's doubly tragic.
If I had had a witness, I would've gotten the world's record for the loudest scream after I backed into Ma's curling iron.
Well, I'll tell you something, Mr Clavin, whether you set the record or not, everyone here considers you a winner.
That's pronounced "wiener".
- Hey.
Hey.
Diane around yet?
- Not yet.
Good.
Does anybody know how to fix this?
What is it?
Well, it's Diane's $500 book.
No wonder it's so expensive.
It's inflatable.
No, no, it's not supposed to look like that, Woody.
- What the heck happened to that?
- Well, I got interested in the darned thing, and I took it home with me and Then picture this.
I get into a nice hot tub.
I'm lying down to soak and read, naked as a jaybird.
And I'm reading, and I'm reading, and I'm-- Hold on, I can't get one of your socks off.
Never mind.
I can.
Anyway, I'm reading and reading, and I finally come to the part where they tell us the terrible thing that happened to this Jake Barnes guy during the war.
- What's that?
- Well, Iet's just say that suddenly he could hit those high notes Iike he never could before.
Ouch.
Yeah, ouch.
That's why I dropped the book in the water.
Now the darned thing won't shut.
All right, just rip out every other page.
Come on, man.
Diane's gonna be really angry at me.
She told me not to touch it, I touched it, and now it's fat.
- Hello, everybody.
- Hi.
Hey, how's it going?
Oh, splendidly.
How's my precious volume?
It's fine.
Why do you even bring it up?
Well, don't be so sensitive.
I just asked because I bought the most beautiful antique bookstand for it.
Is it expandable?
It's very nice.
It's very nice.
The perfect complement to my inscribed first edition The Sun Also Rises.
Isn't it exquisite?
Excuse me, my name is Bruce Sayers.
I'm an avid collector of Hello.
Diane Chambers.
I heard you say that you have an inscribed Sun Also Rises.
- Is it in good condition?
- Oh, it's a lovely copy.
No jacket, of course, but signed by Papa himself.
And it's a lovely thought.
"Dear F. Scott, boy, that Zelda is one crazy chick".
- It's a simple autograph.
- I wonder if it might be for sale?
Oh, no.
I couldn't possibly place a monetary value on something so personal to me.
I'd give you $1,000 for it.
Make the check out to Diane Chambers.
Sam, will you get this man's Hemingway?
- No, you can't do that.
- No, it's perfect.
Now I can pay you back.
No, you can't sell the book.
You love the book, Diane.
Sam, we love people.
We own books.
Besides, even as a child I found Hemingway to be pretentious and over-mannered.
For my taste.
- Sam, go get it from the safe.
- Yeah, I see.
All right, yeah.
This may take a minute.
The safe's-- The combination's kind of complex.
Oh, don't you remember?
It's your birthday.
It is?
Hell, I should be out there celebrating.
Go, Sam.
Pull out these Sam?
Yeah?
I thought it would he better to conduct our business in private.
- What's taking you so long?
- Well, I was just thinking.
Say no more.
You know, I was about to open the safe and a voice in the back of my head said, "Don't let Diane sell the book.
She loves that book".
The voice was wrong.
Open the safe.
I completely understand the value of sentiment, but I must have that book.
Yeah, me too.
That's why I'm gonna give you 1,010.
- Sam.
- Eleven hundred.
- Eleven-ten.
- Do you know what you're doing?
- Eleven-fifty.
- I know it sounds crazy, but when I was getting your book out of the safe very carefully, I started to look through the pages very, very, very carefully, and l Well, I fell in love with the darned thing.
- You're serious, aren't you?
- Yeah, you bet I am.
- Eleven-sixty.
- It must be an extraordinary specimen.
- Eleven-seventy-five.
- Twelve hundred.
- Twelve-- - Stop.
Enough.
We're throwing around monetary figures here as if they had a place in the world of art.
Sam Malone, you have taught me a lesson about the true value of literature tonight.
I'm sorry, Mr Sayers, the book is no longer for sale.
I want Sam to have it.
Oh, all right.
Hey, I hope there are no hard feelings here, Sayers, old man.
I can't say I'm not disappointed, but it's heartening to know there are people around like you.
People who love books.
Love them?
I just wish you could eat them.
I don't know what to say.
I'm looking at you in an entirely new light.
- What do you mean?
- Well, I don't know myself, but I think tonight I saw in full flower the sensitivity you try so hard to conceal.
Oh, well, that's-- That's no big deal.
Oh, no.
You were wonderful.
Yeah, well, I guess my little masquerade's over.
I am sensitive as all get-out.
Honestly, Sam, I don't know what brought about this change, but I find myself extremely attracted to you just now.
There's something stirring inside me.
I don't know what it is, but I'm becoming flushed.
Yeah, maybe it is getting a little hot in here.
Very hot.
And you mean all I had to do was go nuts over a book?
Oh, I know it's crazy.
All the warning signals are flashing.
I never intended for this to happen, but it's out of my control.
Kiss me, Sam.
You know, truth is, I've been thinking about getting a lot more books.
Yeah, maybe even getting a library card, huh?
- Oh, Sam.
- What?
- lsn't it amazing how life works out?
- Yeah.
When we woke up this morning, who would have guessed that we'd end the day this way?
Just look.
You have a beautiful book, I've made myself a tidy little profit, and we're in each other's arms.
A tidy little profit?
Yes.
Your last bid was $1,200.
You expecting $1,200 from me?
No, of course not, you big, foolish man.
I intend to deduct the $500 I owe you, and you really only owe me $700.
But let's stop talking and start rejoicing.
Hold me, Sam.
Sam, you're holding me a little tight.
Sam, I can't breathe.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
Oh, let me help you with that, Sam.
That's okay, Woody.
I'm not as old as I look.
Really?
Sam, I don't know if this would interest you, but I have an extra ticket tonight, Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well and Living in Paris.
He's not doing that underwater stuff anymore?
Jacques Brel was a Belgian balladeer who wrote songs of great passion and power in the '50s and '60s.
You mean like "Who Put the Bop in the Bop Sh-bop Sh-bop"?
So you're busy.
"Who Put the Bop"?
Yeah, you remember that?
The great old song, - right up there with "Yakety Yak".
- "Yakety Yak"?
Oh, come on, you remember the Coasters, don't you?
- No.
- You're kidding.
How about the Shirelles or the Platters or Dixie Cups?
Sorry.
You don't remember any of those old groups?
Oh, old groups.
You mean like Devo.
Maybe you better take this.
Off to class, huh?
What do you got today?
Sissy French Painters of the 1 7th Century.
As a matter of fact, I'm on my way to my Beginning Mime class.
- "Meem"?
- Most people pronounce it mime.
Mime?
Yeah, you know, Woody, those guys with white paint all over their faces so bouncy and happy you just wanna strangle them.
You're not serious.
- Everyone loves a mime.
- No, everybody loves a clown.
Everybody hates a mime.
That's simply not true.
Well, you know, I saw this guy on the Common one day.
Did an amazing performance.
He-- He did a crane, a mother crane, feeding its young.
Turns out the guy was actually choking on a piece of gum.
But I was moved, frankly.
Yeah, well, you know, Norm, you can make light of it all you want, but it is an ancient art form.
It has been around since the times of Caesar Augustine.
Yeah?
So have those socks you're wearing.
Who cares?
Well, you know, it is the purest form of communication.
Diane, why don't you give us a little exhibition here.
Oh, I couldn't.
I'm really just a novice.
I've only had three lessons.
All right.
Oh, all right, ladies and gentlemen, Diane, the "mimette".
All right, she's starting off here with your basic cop directing traffic.
And segueing into a waiter carrying a heavy tray of dishes.
Yes, good.
And completing it with the midget imitating Judy Garland.
Very nice, bravo, bravo!
Very good.
It was a person trapped in a shrinking box.
I'd say you'd better scurry off to class.
You got a lot of practicing to do.
Now, that I know.
- Hey, Sammy, mail in?
- Yeah, there you go.
- You expecting something special?
- Oh, I don't wanna talk about it.
It's too depressing.
Oh, come on.
We're your buddies here.
Yeah, you don't wanna keep that stuff inside, Carla.
It'll eat you up.
Oh, yeah, it's just what I need.
You chowderheads trying to solve my problems.
Come on now, I'd say that four brains plus whatever Cliffy has are better than one.
Come on.
We wanna help.
Let us help.
- Yeah.
- Okay, okay, try this one for size.
In case you haven't noticed, my luck with men hasn't been so great lately.
In fact, all my dates fall into two categories: geeks and those studying to enter the geekhood.
So in order to increase my odds, I decided to enlist the full resources of the media.
I put this ad in the personals of Boston Scene.
So it's been two weeks, and no one has answered.
Can you help with that?
- Well, all right.
- Yeah.
Give us a second here.
All right, guys?
- Hey.
- Yeah, what?
What do you got?
You got a crack in the ceiling there, Sammy.
Just what I thought.
Thanks, guys.
Oh, come on, come on back here, would you?
We're just kidding now.
Now we're gonna really help.
Hey, why would he write you here anyway?
Well, you think I want some sex-starved creep camped out on my doorstep?
One of my neighbours might get him first.
Just let me-- Let me see the ad.
Which one is it?
Right there.
Right after "speed eater seeks same".
All right, all right.
"Divorced female, warm, witty and ltalian in every way except fat".
- Well, sounds good so far.
- Yeah.
"Thirty-three, 5-foot and a quarter inch, dark brown hair, brown eyes, no visible scars, tattoos or birthmarks.
Seeking possible serious relationship.
Note, I have six children.
This is not a misprint.
Six".
Oh, my, I can't believe not one guy has answered this.
Carla, my dear, you're forgetting, like, the basic principle of advertising.
Lying.
Oh, sure, I could tell him I got no kids, right?
- Right.
Right.
- I could tell him that I'm 21, 5'9", - Right.
- gorgeous green eyes, flaming red hair and ta-tas till Tuesday.
But how am I gonna explain the way I really look when he sees me?
Stress?
Hey, all right, next time I spill my guts, remind me to do it in front of friends.
- I was just trying to cheer you up.
- I am in no mood to be cheered up.
Next guy tries to cheer me up is gonna get open-face surgery.
I don't get it.
She's got ta-tas till Monday afternoon at least.
Boy, she's really bad off.
Come on, come on, listen, we gotta think here now.
All right, come on, put ourselves in her place.
What would I do if I couldn't get a date?
Who am I kidding?
- Well, why don't one of us write her?
- You wanna date her?
No, no, no.
No, I think he means, why don't we make up a guy?
I don't know, man.
Make up a guy, it's just too risky.
Too risky.
Yeah, she'd suspect something the minute she met him.
No, no, no, we wouldn't have to let it go that far.
In the meantime, we're giving her hope, a little confidence.
The more confident she is, the more attractive she'll feel.
That'll make her more attractive to some real guy.
Or something like that.
- Sounds good.
- All right, I'm in.
- Okay?
- Yep, we got two.
All for one, one for all, huh?
Gee, Mr Clavin, your hands are soft like a girl's.
My feet have got calluses on them, just like every other part of my body.
Woody, get me some paper there.
Hey, Carla's gonna love this, don't you think?
I hope she realizes what great friends she has here.
You bet.
She will.
And if she doesn't, what do you say we just have - this guy dump all over her?
- Good idea.
- We don't have any with lines.
- That's okay, I'll be careful.
Okay, before we start writing, I suggest we just figure out who exactly this guy is.
No, we're making him up.
He can be anybody we want him to be.
Doctor, ski instructor-- No, that's the point.
If the guy's too fabulous, she'll be on to us.
All right, it's gotta be somebody, though, who's not in her league usually.
We could make him a postman.
- No, no, too much.
- No, no.
Boy, you guys, we're sunk already.
She asked for a picture.
Yeah?
Now, wait-- Wait a second.
Here, we're back afloat here.
Check this out.
How's this for your basic stud?
- Oh, oh, nice.
- Oh, nice, great.
Who is he?
No idea.
Just came with the wallet.
Hey, look at this.
Letter for Carla Tortelli.
- What?
- My goodness.
- Let me see.
Come on, come on!
- What's the magic word?
- Gelding.
- That's the one.
What is it, Carla?
Someone or thing had the nerve to answer my ad.
Okay, everybody, gather around for a good laugh.
"My dearest Carla, I was intrigued by your warm, honest ad.
I'll be candid as well.
I was married myself, but, sadly, it failed.
I'm not much for bars or the singles scene.
I prefer a quiet night, a warm fire and pleasant company".
- Very sensitive, very sensitive.
- Yeah, yeah.
"I'd love to meet you soon, but unfortunately my job as an international airline pilot keeps me real busy flying places most people only dream about".
- Talking adventuresome.
- Yeah.
"For the moment, then, we'll have to depend on the U.S. Postal Service".
No trouble there.
"Sincerely, Mitch Wainwright.
- P.S., I love kids".
- Oh, no, you're kidding me.
Boy.
You really hit the mother lode there, didn't you?
- I don't know.
- What do you mean, you don't know?
What do you want?
Well, I guess he does sound kind of great.
- You bet he does.
- Yeah.
Carla, you have no way of knowing if this man is telling the truth - about himself.
- Don't you think I've thought of that?
But if this guy is only half as good as he sounds, he's twice as good as any of the dirtbags I've ever dated.
- I just wish he'd sent a picture.
- He did.
- What?
- Probably.
He probably did.
- Yeah.
- Check in the envelope there.
Check.
- There is a picture.
- You're kidding.
- Oh, yeah?
- Hey.
- Come to Mama.
- Oh, look at that guy.
- Handsome.
- Oh, yeah.
Hey, how about that?
Good times, huh?
- Yeah.
- There's something suspicious - about this whole situation.
- No, there's nothing suspicious here.
- How do you know?
- I know.
I know.
Sam, is this your handiwork?
I can't believe you did something this stupid.
She was depressed.
We were trying to help her out.
That's all.
Nothing's going to top the depression of going after the man of her dreams and finding you there.
Believe me, I know whereof I speak.
There's no way she's gonna find out.
Hey, this guy looks familiar.
- Where have I seen this face before?
- Probably the airport.
- Yeah.
- Pilots hang out there.
- All the time.
- I got it.
He's in a frame I just bought at Woolworth's.
You're kidding.
Oh, my God.
He's a model too.
Is that right?
So did Carla get the latest edition of the Mitch Gazette yet?
Yeah, she's in the back reading it right now.
Have you noticed how Carla is kind of perking up lately?
I'll admit she's much less repulsive.
Bordering on sufferable, but that doesn't make what you're doing right.
Oh, come on, give her her moment in the sun there.
I mean, after all, you had yours with me.
You're not referring to that nanosecond under a penlight are you?
Oh, no, what--?
- What is that?
- A little surprise I have for you, Sam.
I hate surprises.
And you know what else I hate.
Bravo!
Sam, I'd like you to meet Lev Agajanian, better known as Sotto the Mime.
Sotto, this is Sam Malone.
Oh, hi.
Oh, that's very funny, very funny.
- Get him out of here, please.
- Sam, be nice.
Sotto is our mime-in-residence at the college and a visitor to this country.
- Whatever.
- Hi!
My name's Woody Boyd!
- Woody, you don't have to shout.
- Oh, he's a lip-reader.
Sam, what would you say if I told you that Sotto has generously offered to entertain your customers?
- No.
- Oh, please.
- No.
- I predict that by the end of the evening you'll have fallen in love with this art form, and Sotto will have picked up a lot of spare change.
See, this is the stuff I hate.
Sam, this is his art.
- Well, just keep his art out of my face.
- Thank you, Sam.
Hey, would you please get off my bar there?
You won't regret this.
Oh, so where's your flyboy off to this time, Carla?
Cairo.
He's gonna buzz the Sphinx for me in his 747.
Good Lord.
Even the stick's jealous.
I just can't wait to meet this guy face to face.
Although I am gonna play hard to get.
I intend to meet him with all my clothes on.
Carla, since you mentioned it, when are you going to meet this Mitch fellow?
Well, he's doing the Paris to Bombay flight now.
I have to wait until they switch him back to the domestic route.
- You know, life's funny.
- Why is that?
I mean, today I'm with Mitch on top of the world.
And just a couple of weeks ago, I'd have settled for fish bait - like Vinnie Claussen.
- Who's Vinnie Claussen?
Some loser who had the nerve to answer my ad.
Carla?
Yeah, wait, wait, hold on a second here.
Listen, maybe you should reconsider this.
- You know, Mitch is out of town a lot.
- Yeah.
Maybe you might like this Vinnie guy.
Yeah, there's nothing wrong with playing the field.
Except with someone who's grazing in it.
- What are you talking about?
- Look at this guy.
Fetch.
Really, take a look at him.
He's not that bad-looking.
Yeah, but next to Mitch he looks like a weasel.
But looks aren't everything, Carla.
I mean, Vinnie, I bet he's got a lot of stuff going for him.
Oh, I don't know about you, but being a funeral director seems darn near - as thrilling as aviation to me.
- Yeah, they got flowers, limousines.
Hey, forget it, forget it, all right?
I'm through with bozos like that.
I'm at the University of Mitch now.
Well, I hope you're all proud of yourselves.
Carla is now turning down living, breathing human beings for your mythical aviator.
Guys, how come we didn't see this one coming?
Oh, this from a group who every year fails to see winter coming.
Thanks for reminding me, Diane.
I gotta take those screens down.
Hey, Sam, what time does the floor show end?
Yeah, I got it, I got it, I got it.
Hey, come here, come here, come here.
Listen, Sotto, we gotta talk.
Yeah, all right, all right.
Now, don't do this.
Listen, the whole-- That's very clever, yeah.
Listen, you've been here three hours.
This is just not working out.
I'm gonna start losing customers here.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
Now, I want you to beat it.
Oh, God, don't tempt me, man.
Don't - Sam, is there a problem?
- Yeah, get him out of here before there's clown white all over the walls.
- Yeah.
- Sotto.
I think my attempt at enlightening Sam has failed.
I'm afraid you're going to have to go.
So I'll see you tomorrow.
I know.
I know what will win them over.
Do your robot that winds down.
Wonderful.
You're a master.
What control.
Mime putting.
Same time tomorrow?
He spoke!
It's a miracle!
Yeah, okay, all right.
From now on nobody works in this bar that wears more makeup than you do.
All right.
Excuse me.
My name is Vinnie Claussen.
How do you do?
Well, you don't look like a weasel.
Thank you.
Neither do you.
- Is Carla Tortelli here?
- Oh, just a minute.
Hey, Carla?
- Vinnie Claussen is here to see you.
- What's he doing here?
You better not watch this, kid.
You're about to see a guy's dreams dashed on the rocks of Tortelli Point.
- Carla?
- Yeah.
- I'm Vinnie Claussen.
- Yeah, I know, I got your letter.
Already?
Oh, I was hoping to meet you before you got it.
I don't express myself very well on paper, and it's not the best picture of me-- Look, Vinnie, Vinnie, I really-- I don't wanna see you making a fool of yourself in front of all these people.
The fact of the matter is someone beat you to me.
Oh, gee, I'm sorry to hear that.
Especially now that I've met you.
Well, I'd offer her as a consolation prize, but you're probably sick - of dealing with stiffs.
- Well, I guess I'll be leaving then.
- Yeah, better luck next time.
- Sam.
Vinnie, let me buy you a drink here, would you?
Take care of him.
- Carla, can I talk to you for a second?
- Yep.
So how long you been interested in dead guys?
Listen, before I start, do me a favour, will you?
Stick your hands in your pockets and keep them there till I'm finished.
- What's going on?
- Just humour me, will you?
Okay, but don't start in on me about going out with this Claussen guy.
I mean, he's all right, but he's no Mitch.
Listen to me.
Mitch doesn't exist.
The guys and I made him up.
- You what?
- Well, you were so depressed we figured we had to do something, so we made the guy up, wrote the letters and rented a post office box for you to write to him.
Oh, damn.
- Damn, I forgot the feet.
- You are scum.
You are the scum that scum scrapes off the bottom of their shoes.
You're always looking at the negative side to everything.
I hate your guts.
I hate every one of you.
I mean, why did you do this?
What, was it some big laugh, huh?
You wanted to see me get all moony-eyed and then yank the rug out.
Was that it, get a big laugh?
- No, sweetheart.
- No?
Then what did you do it for?
What did you think was gonna come of this?
Well, we had that covered.
We weren't gonna let you get hurt.
When it came time to meet the guy, we were gonna have the plane go down in the South Pacific.
Damn!
- Okay, I'm sorry.
- Hey, just drop dead twice.
Carla, wait.
Wait.
Now, there's something you don't understand.
What they did was imbecilic, moronic and ill-conceived.
Oh, that's the way, sugarcoat it.
But it was not done to make you the butt of a joke.
It was done because your friends saw their dear friend hurting.
And they wanted to help.
Now, you can either walk out of here angrily, or you can trust your friends and forgive them.
And take advantage of the opportunity seated at the bar.
Come on, why don't you give the guy a chance?
I mean, he answered your ad.
He's dying to date you.
Hey, where do you think you're going?
- Oh, I finished my drink.
- Sit down!
Nice touch, nice touch.
Does this--?
Does this mean you're gonna go out with him?
- I'm thinking about it.
- All right, okay, okay.
Actually, in a dimly lit bar he's not the worst thing I've ever seen.
Writes a good letter.
I'd probably give him as big a thrill as this Mitch guy was giving me.
Get out of here.
Honey, what do you say?
Oh, all right, you're off the hook.
Just tell me one thing.
Who wrote all those lovey parts?
Oh, that was my department.
You did a real good job.
Well, I'm sorry if I got carried away there.
But with you, it's kind of easy.
So they say.
So how do you feel about girls on the rebound?
Oh, I've dated a few.
Mostly widows.
Yeah.
Let's get out of here, huh?
Oh, I know this real nice restaurant.
Great, great.
So you like kids, huh?
Like them?
I love them.
I got seven of my own.
- Carla.
Carla.
- I'm joking.
I'm only joking.
Hey, Vinnie, could you do me a favour?
I mean, just for tonight, could you pretend that your name is Mitch and that you're an airline pilot?
Well, I guess.
If you'll call yourself Raven and pretend you're a Vegas showgirl.
You're weird.
I like that.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
You sure you don't wanna have another round?
Not me, pal.
Let's get out of here.
What's the damage, Mac?
Oh, just let me figure it up here.
That'll be 27.50.
Ouch.
You sure?
Yep, you two gentlemen had four peach daiquiris and three cr√®me de menthe frapp√©s.
Something funny, dipstick?
In the paper this morning, yeah, it seems that, oh, the Sarge got tricked by Beetle Bailey again.
See, Beetle put some itching powder in his shorts.
Oh, we thought that maybe you was laughing at our drink order.
Oh, on the contrary.
No, no, no-- Woody, let me have another mocha froth, will you?
And keep them coming.
Hey, guess who's gonna interview me on the radio tonight?
Someone with a taste for adventure.
- Dave Richards, my old buddy.
- Hey.
And a 2-by-4 for a brain.
I need Dewar's rocks, please.
What's your big problem with Dave?
I mean, ever since he came in this place, you've been badmouthing the guy.
For some strange reason, I find it hard to respect a man with the bumper sticker "Honk if you're horny".
- That's pretty good.
- Yeah.
Honk, honk, honk!
Oh, there's news.
Hey, Sam, what time do you have to be at the radio station?
No, it's a phone interview.
You know, it's that sports talk show that Dave does after the Red Sox games.
- Evening, everybody.
- Norm!
- What do you say, Norm?
- Well, I never met a beer I didn't drink.
And down it goes, huh?
- We missed you last night, buddy.
- You did?
- Yeah.
- Well, Vera and I went out dancing with the Henshaws.
The next-door neighbours.
- Oh, what, again?
- Normie, dancing?
- Yeah.
- I didn't think you liked walking.
You kidding?
I love dancing.
I could watch for hours.
You don't dance yourself?
Vera's the dancer in our family.
She even has dancer's buns, Sammy.
Too bad they're on her calves, though.
You know, it's kind of So, Normie, who was the--?
Who was Vera dancing with then?
- The guy, Ron Henshaw.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
Good dancer.
- Oh, is he?
Well, they dance the slow dances, do they?
Yeah, a few times.
Why do you ask, Cliff?
Oh, no reason, no reason.
But you know, during the slow dances, certain parts of the body rub up against one another.
You know, thigh touches thigh, purely by accident.
Before you know it, you're hosing them off like dogs.
It's good clean fun, all right, Cliffy?
Yeah, well, I know which way the wind blows.
Yeah, usually out of your mouth.
Cheers.
Oh, yeah, he's right here.
Sam, it's some guy from the radio station.
Dave's ready to go on the air!
All right, all right, I'll be in my office.
Pipe down.
I can't believe I'm talking to a real radio station.
Hey, hey, listen, while I've got you, could you please play "Roxanne" and dedicate it to my girl?
No, no, her name's Beth.
But I don't think there's a song called "Beth".
Oh, hi, Sam.
Oh, right, I'll hang up.
Goodbye.
Well, it's not really goodbye because we're not actually-- Right now?
Yes, okay.
They're ready.
- What's the score?
- What's the line?
- Who's ahead?
- Who's behind?
Hey, let's ask Dave!
Who's behind?
Come on, can we say that on the air?
Yes, it's me, Dave Richards, with Sports Shorts.
Well, we don't have much time because the Red Sox were involved in another long, boring extra-inning game.
So let's get right to tonight's guest.
He's former Red Sox relief pitcher and one of my buds, Sam Malone.
How you doing?
Sure am, Dave.
How are you?
- Just great.
And you?
- Couldn't be better.
That's great to hear.
Boy, we've had some fun Where does one send for a transcript?
Well, I think we've hogged the airwaves long enough, Sam.
So let's open up those phone lines for you listeners out there.
Got a question you've been dying to ask Sam Malone?
Well, here's your chance.
Former major league great Mayday Malone.
All the lines are clear, and it is a toll-free call.
It doesn't have to be about baseball.
Anything at all.
Anything.
Hey, we've got a call.
You're on the Shorts.
Hey, Sam, where'd you put the olives?
Woody-- Woody, get off the-- Get off the phone!
- He said, "Anything at all".
- Here's another one.
- Go ahead.
- Sam, you were known as quite a ladies' man during your playing days.
Are women more impressed by a man in a baseball uniform?
Well, actually I found women were a lot more impressed when I was out of my uniform, if you get my drift.
Hey.
No, seriously, you know, a lot of the chicks I dated know nothing about the game of baseball at all.
You know, in fact, one former love bunny actually brought a book to a Red Sox game to pass time between pitches.
- "Love bunny"?
- A book?
You mean, like, to read?
I swear to God, Dave.
Gee, I wonder who that was, Diane.
--his grandchildren about that.
Anyway, this is Dave Richards saying, "Be a sport.
Don't be a jerk.
" Goodbye.
Great show.
Hey, do you love me, public?
Love bunny?
What's wrong with that?
How dare you callously and cruelly lump me in with the other conglomeration of Twinkies that constitutes your sexual past.
There's just no pleasing that woman.
- Hello, Norm.
- Oh, Phyllis.
- What are you doing here?
- Well, I took the chance - I might find you here.
- Whoa, what are the odds?
You guys, this is Phyllis Henshaw.
- Hi.
- So where's Ron?
I don't know.
Could we talk privately?
Sure, yeah.
Just follow me here.
- Can I get you anything?
- No.
No, thank you.
What's up?
Norm, I've been trying to think of an easy way to say this, but I can't.
I think Vera and Ron are having an affair.
Vera and Ron?
Did you guys all get that back there?
That's just great.
How about you guys?
Did you get that, everyone?
Come on, let's just get away from the peanut gallery here.
This is kind of hard to believe, Phyllis.
I mean, what makes you think they are?
- Oh, Norm, come on.
You're not blind.
- What?
What?
Haven't you seen the way they look at each other when they're dancing?
And I don't have to tell you how attractive Vera is.
No, you certainly don't.
And Ron's always going over to "borrow" things from you.
Yeah, but-- Well, all right, yeah.
Now, Vera said that he came over yesterday to borrow a power drill, - but I really - Norm, we have a power drill.
Variable speed?
Yes.
- Cordless?
- Oh, my God!
Phyllis, this doesn't necessarily mean anything.
Well, we have to find out.
I think we ought to hire a private detective.
No, I think you're jumping the gun a little bit.
- Oh, are we?
- Yes.
Yeah, I do.
Well, Ron told me he'd be home all night.
Let's just see if he is.
Phyllis, I'm sure-- Look-- Get-- So, what's up, buddy?
It's probably nothing, I hope.
Oh, come on, Norm.
Fill us in, will you?
I mean, we're-- We're your friends here.
We're sensitive and caring, and our only concern is your support.
You know that, Norman.
Well, all right, how much did you overhear so far?
Well, everything but the location where they're satisfying their pagan lust.
No, this just can't be true, Mr Peterson.
They wouldn't do that.
I mean, they're both married, for Pete's sake.
How old are you?
Well, what--?
What happened?
Ron's not home.
- Hire a private dick, Norm.
- Hey, my cousin Santo's a gumshoe, - and a great one.
- Great, great.
He's professional, thorough and a master of disguise.
- I'm sure he is.
- Not just as people either, but things.
Furniture.
I mean, he could be here right now.
Norman, I think it's a mistake.
Don't give in to suspicion.
Baloney!
Hire Santo.
Better safe than sorry.
- No, Norm - Norman, trust-- Trust-- Who are these people?
All right.
Wait a minute.
Just-- Would you wait a minute, now?
Phyllis, you may not know about Ron, but Vera happens to love me, all right?
And I certainly love her.
I'm gonna call her right this minute.
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna tell her that.
- Yeah.
- She better be there to hear it.
She will.
Oh, hi, honey.
No, nothing, nothing, I just, actually, called to tell you that I love you.
The usual time.
All right, fine.
Yeah, bye.
Bye.
She said she's just sitting home alone listening to records.
Oh, I could hear Johnny Mathis singing in the background.
There you go.
I knew it.
Now, that's good news, isn't it, Mr Peterson?
Yeah.
It'd even be better if we had a Johnny Mathis album.
We have one.
All right, Carla, call your cousin.
Hey.
Did you enjoy your dinner?
Hey.
Hey, listen.
Excuse me, miss?
Are you or are you not speaking to me?
Never ever again.
How could you?
After all we've been through.
What we had together was real and special, and now you've cheapened it for all eternity by broadcasting to the entire Boston metropolitan area that I was nothing but an odalisque in your seraglio.
If that's your idea of the silent treatment, it needs a little work.
Oh, come on All right, all right, whatever it is I said, and whatever the hell it was that you just said, what if--?
What if I go back on the air there and apologize?
Will that fix things up?
Do whatever you want.
I couldn't care less.
Keep it short and simple.
Something dignified.
No sweat.
I'll write the script for you.
Well, is there anything else you can tell me?
No.
No, I think that's just about everything.
When can you start?
Look, you both seem like nice people, huh?
Do yourselves a favour.
Don't hire me.
Well, that's an interesting sales pitch you have there, - but we're quite serious about this.
- And you don't know what you're letting yourselves in for here.
A lot of pain, a lot of heartache, a lot of misery.
And that's just when you see the bill.
My cousin, she's a pistol.
Mr Carbone, by hiring you, we hope to prove our spouses innocent.
- Yeah, there you go.
- Well, in most of these cases the news is otherwise.
Believe me, I've seen it a million times.
A bored husband, fed up with leftovers in the bedroom as well as the kitchen, starts eyeing the cute little pastry tart next door who's only too happy to serve up a little dessert.
That's not true in our case, is it, Norm?
No.
No way.
Anyone else hungry?
Look, nothing like this has ever happened before.
Up until now, we've both had happy marriages.
Please, believe me, people who don't know are better off.
- Could you excuse us for a minute?
- Yeah, sure.
Well, Norm, what do you think?
I'm not so sure we should hire this guy.
Well, if we're being made fools of, I'd prefer to know it.
Can't we just assume it and save a little money here?
All right, look, Mr Carbone, we're gonna hire your services, all right?
Your funeral.
- Thanks for the referral, Carla.
- Yeah, see you, Santo.
Yeah.
- You're Diane Chambers, aren't you?
- Yes, I am.
You look familiar.
Weren't you an attendant at Goldenbrook?
That was just my cover.
Santo was the one who I hired to track you down at the insane asylum.
It wasn't an insane asylum, damn it!
It was more like a spa.
You're out already, huh?
Of course I'm out.
- Why wouldn't I be out?
- No reason.
Look, you take it easy.
Okay, Sam Malone is back on the show with a prepared statement that he's gonna read.
Go ahead, Sammy.
Ladies and gentlemen, a week ago on this program, l, Sam Malone, committed a faux pas of the highest magnitude.
I insensitively included a wonderful woman in a category in which she certainly did not merit inclusion.
I apologize to her and indeed to women everywhere, both living and dead, whose sensibilities may have been offended.
Yeah, yeah, well, whatever peels your potatoes, Sam.
Our next guest is a guy that played-- - Very well done.
Thank you, Sam.
- Yeah?
You're welcome, little love bunny.
Oy vey.
You all right, Mr Peterson?
You've been awful quiet tonight.
I was thinking about a high school football game, actually.
That was a long time ago, Woody.
And far away from here.
We were playing our archrivals for the state championship, you know?
And I saw the cutest little cheerleader that I've ever seen in my life just cheering her heart out.
Yeah.
I looked at her, and the sun seemed to be shining only where she stood.
You know what I mean?
And she seemed to be everything that was bright and pure and good.
I knew right then and there that l wanted to make that little gal my wife.
So I turned to Vera, and I said, "Honey, would you mind introducing me to that cheerleader"?
I'm joking, Woody.
Of course that little cheerleader was Vera.
Hey, can I ask you a question, Mr Peterson?
- Sure, Woody.
- Who won the game?
You know, I really couldn't tell you who won, Woody, but tonight I sure know who lost.
Well, can't you figure it out from that?
- Could I have another beer, please?
- Yeah.
Coming up.
Norm.
Hi, I just got a call from Mr Carbone.
He's gonna drop by with his report in a few minutes.
- Did he say anything?
- No, he said he wanted to wait and talk to us in person.
Oh, man.
Could we wait in the backroom, where it's private?
All right.
Sure.
- Oh, Norm, where did we go wrong?
- I don't know.
I've been racking my brain trying to figure it out.
I mean, day after day, night after night, I sit on that stool out there wondering, "Why did she lose interest in me"?
Norm, listen.
Whatever the outcome, I want you to know I couldn't have gotten through this without you.
You've been a tower of strength.
You've been great too, Phyllis.
Thank you.
What if the news is bad?
I mean, what then?
- Well, I know what I'm gonna do.
- Oh, yeah?
I'm gonna go right out and have an affair myself.
Maybe lots of them.
You are darn right.
That's exactly what I'm gonna do.
Just watch my dust.
Of course, the difficult part is finding the right person.
It's hard, all right.
Now, that's always the hard part.
You know, it would have to be someone who really understands me.
You know what I mean?
Someone you could depend on?
But who?
I wouldn't know where to begin.
I'd be completely lost.
Of course, I wouldn't wanna break up a marriage like those two home wreckers.
Those jackals.
Adulterers.
Fornicators.
All right-- Oh, for God's sakes!
Boy, this is one for the books.
God help us all.
All right.
Just-- No commentary, please.
Skip it and just give us the report here.
All right, all right.
I followed them everywhere.
From the supermarket to the movie theatre to the golf course.
Last night I got what I wanted at the Sea Shanty restaurant.
- Well, let's hear the tape.
- Yeah, let's.
I don't wanna hang around here any longer than I gotta.
- We've put this off too long.
- Well, we wanted to be sure - about some things.
- Right, l-- - Busboy dropped a tray.
- What did she say?
- I couldn't hear a thing.
- What did you say?
I said I can't go through with it.
I just can't hurt Norm.
I feel exactly the same way.
I can't hurt Norm either.
- Well, I guess that's that.
- Yeah, I just realized in a strange kind of way that I still love him.
With all his faults.
He's never home.
And so he hangs out in some bar downtown.
As far as our sex life goes, he's not exactly Don Juan.
It's more like Don of the Dead.
I think we get the gist here.
So nothing went on.
Nothing.
Vera and Ron happen to be two of the sweetest people I ever ran across.
They actually changed my mind about this filthy business.
Then I walk in here, and I'm right back in the sewer.
Well, you'll pardon me if I go home now, won't you?
I mean, suddenly I feel like a shower.
Hey-- You know-- I'm gonna miss him.
I Well that's good news then, right, Norm?
Yeah, I guess so.
So I guess we don't have to go out and find somebody to have an affair with.
Guess not.
Norm, can I ask you something?
Yeah.
When we kissed before, did anything happen?
Of course something happened.
Why would you ask that?
You don't believe what Vera said about our sex life?
- No, no, not at all.
- Okay.
Fine.
It's just that, well, you know, just because Ron and Vera didn't do anything doesn't mean that we have to Well, what I'm trying to say is, is that when we kissed something happened to me.
When I heard that tape, Phyllis, something happened to me.
I realized how much Vera means to me.
Well, then, why don't you just run on home to your precious little wife?
All right, I'm gonna.
I'm gonna do just that.
Right after a couple more beers.
- I'm sorry, Norm.
- No, no, no.
You know, in a strange kind of way, I like Vera.
Yeah, well, that's the only kind of way you can.
Oh, stop it.
Yeah.
I kind of like her too.
- You know, she's a lucky woman.
- Come on.
You are a definite hunk.
Bye-bye.
Norm Peterson hunk.
- Hi there.
- Get lost.
Right.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
Buon giorno, Norm.
Cliffie.
Yeah.
- Kind of bright out there today, huh?
- Yeah, I wouldn't know.
Yeah.
I feel sorry for all those people that have to squint.
Say, Cliff, those wouldn't be new glasses, would they?
Oh, hey, you noticed, huh?
Yeah, ltalian imports.
Sixty-five smack-a-roonies.
That's right.
Notice the sleek, European styling there, the sturdy reinforced frames, and the hi-tech, shatterproof reflective lenses that allow me to scope out the dollies without drawing attention to myself.
You could walk up to them naked with your hair on fire and not draw attention to yourself.
Yeah?
What would you know?
They only work on women.
You!
They seem to have given you courage.
- Prove it.
- Well, what do you mean?
Yeah, I wouldn't mind seeing a little demonstration myself.
- So - All right, all right.
All right.
All right!
You've got the shades.
What are you worrying about?
Excuse me.
Oh, perfect!
Thanks.
Well, I don't care what anybody says, we had better chatter out there.
Shut up, Cliff.
Sounds suspiciously as if there is no joy in Mudville.
Who gives a damn?
We lost.
We didn't lose.
We got dumped on.
We were dragged by our noses through the dung heap.
They ripped out our guts, held them up for us to see, and then they rammed them down our throats.
It's a grand old game.
Damn!
Now I know why they weren't afraid to let me play.
They were great out there.
They were like the '27 Yankees.
He's exaggerating.
There were only nine of them.
Come on, guys.
We can't just sit around crying in our beer here.
- Norman's right.
- We don't have any.
Come on, Diane, step on it, will you.
I feel a tear welling up here.
What the hell?
First round on the house.
Hey, Sammy!
Yeah, well, if you think I'm drinking with you guys, you're nuts!
I'd rather drink with those snail pellets from Gary's Old Towne Tavern.
- At least they're winners.
- That really hurts, Carla.
Hey, really, I don't think we played so bad, you know.
- Listen to Mr Gold Glove over here.
- Come on!
Yeah?
You drew more flies than bad liver.
Oh, give me a break!
The only thing more amazing than that was you dropped every one of them.
Come on, will you.
I just have a little problem with balls hit directly at me.
The I think it's probably the sun, you know, or that I can't bend over.
Poor Norman.
Well, at least some of us looked good out there, huh?
Yeah, Cliff, the less of your face showing, the better.
Oh, listen to yourselves.
You're letting a minor setback in some trivial competition ruin what is an otherwise lovely day.
Forget it, Sam.
You just don't get it, do you?
It's not just that the guys from Gary's beat us at basketball, volleyball, darts and every other sport known to mankind.
It's more than that.
I'm a jock.
This is a jock bar, but if we keep losing, all the jocks are gonna say, "Hey, Cheers is for losers.
Let's go drink over at Gary's".
Oh, they'll never say that.
They'll say, "Me no like Cheers.
Let's go to Gary's".
Gentlemen of Cheers.
And ladies.
- Tough game out there today.
- What are you doing here?
Boy, you guys have the worst luck.
Yeah, it looks like it just followed us home, huh?
Listen, we were over having a celebration at my little tavern and I kept thinking, "Something's missing".
It wasn't as happy as it usually is when we beat you.
And then I realized what it was.
I didn't get a chance to thank you guys for the game.
So I came over here to do it now.
Way to go.
The pop-up king.
Many thanks.
Great glasses.
This is what I was afraid of.
Hard feelings.
What are you talking about?
You guys have nothing to hang your heads about.
You played hard.
You played clean.
You gave it your all.
Just remember, it takes two sides to make a victory.
One side to win and you guys.
Excuse me, but you've obviously come here to belittle my friends.
Why?
I can only speculate.
Perhaps you're compensating for some physical shortcoming.
I don't know.
But it's tragic that you place such stock in a silly competition.
What of higher attainments?
What of loftier pursuits?
What of art?
And philosophy?
What of music?
I graduated magna cum laude in American Literature from Princeton.
Oh?
Couldn't make summa?
Hey, look, Gar.
You only came here to rub our noses in it.
You've done a great job.
Mission accomplished.
Now why don't you take off.
- Yeah, take a hike.
- Sam, I came here in the spirit of sportsmanship.
I'll show you sportsmanship.
People!
People!
This is neither the time nor the place for such childish behaviour.
Yeah, let's save it for when we kick his butt.
In what?
We're kind of running out of sports, aren't we?
Well, it's really been a truly enjoyable afternoon.
Gentlemen, ladies.
- See you.
- Hey, hey, hey.
Listen, I'll have you know that I'm putting together a team right this moment, that's gonna have you shaking in those shoes of yours.
Hey, those are nice.
Well, thanks.
And is that a challenge?
- Yeah.
- In what sport?
I'll tell you in what sport.
In - Bowling.
- Yeah, bowling.
Great!
I've knocked down a pin or two in my day.
- When and where?
- Well, I'll just let you know.
- Okay?
- Okay.
Okay.
- Okay.
- Okay!
- Okay!
- Okay!
- Okay!
- Okay!
Bowling?
Don't worry.
I got this theory, Sam.
You see, all of those other sports required real athletic ability, but with bowling, we got the makings of a great team!
- Oh, Carla, l - Oh, listen, listen!
You go to any bowling alley, what do you see?
A bunch of out-of-shape couch potatoes who do nothing but sit around and swill beer.
All right, we're number one!
Back so soon from the sport of the great unwashed?
How was the audition?
Tryout.
Diane, in sports, it's called a tryout.
- We got a team.
- Yeah, of what, I'd like to know.
I'm gonna call Gary and call it off.
I'm telling you, when one lousy bar can't produce four decent bowlers, it's time for America to take a long, hard look at itself.
Hey, you!
You don't know anything about bowling, do you?
Hey, Woodhead I asked you if you know how to bowl.
You have bowled, haven't you?
- Yes.
- When?
- When?
- Before.
- Before what?
- Before I came to Cheers.
You're good, aren't you?
I won a couple trophies.
Sammy.
Sam, Sam, don't-- Don't call it off!
What?
What?
Hold on a second.
- We got a ringer.
- Got a what?
We got a ringer.
Woody.
Woody is a bowling machine.
Trust me.
He's got a room full of trophies.
Hey, Gar.
No, we're not wimping out.
Yeah, tomorrow.
Vic's Bowl-A-Rama.
We rumble.
Okay!
Okay!
- All right, Woody!
- Woody!
Please don't ask me to bowl.
I can't.
Why not?
The tragedy.
- Well, what tragedy?
- What tragedy?
Once I maimed a man in a bowling accident.
I'll never bowl again as long as I live.
Great idea, Sam.
Bowling.
Okay, it's time to go.
Let's see if we can, you know, maybe somehow manage not to embarrass ourselves.
Ladies and gentlemen, Knute Rockne.
Come on, let's go.
I wanna warm up.
Hold on a second, guys.
Say, Woody, it's still not too late to change your mind.
Don't you understand?
I maimed a man.
Bowling accidents happen.
You read about them in the paper all the time.
He was only an innocent maintenance man.
Come on, man.
He knew the risks.
I still don't know what happened.
One minute, I was picking up the eight-ten split, and the next thing I know, the ten pin flies and hits old Sully right between the eyes and he goes down like a sack of wheat.
Sam, I ruined the man's life.
I'm sure you're exaggerating.
Oh, no.
No, I'm not.
Old Sully got too dim-witted to stay in bowling maintenance.
Last I heard, he was a clown at children's birthday parties.
- Well, what's wrong with that?
- He wasn't invited to them.
Come on, Woody.
Listen, man, I've never begged for anything in my life that I actually enjoyed once I got it.
Come on.
Please.
Come on, join the team here.
We need you, Woody.
Come on.
I can't!
Since the accident, I haven't been able to set foot in a bowling alley.
Well, why don't you just try it today.
Maybe the memory's faded.
- You don't understand what's at stake.
- Can't you hear me?
No!
Sammy, I'll take a crack at him here.
Listen to me, all right?
Now, every once in a while you just gotta look beyond yourself, okay?
And think about the team.
Like my old high school football coach used to always say: "Give the ball to Peterson.
He'll know what to do with it".
Well, hey, I didn't want that responsibility, but for the good of the team, you understand, I took it.
We went ahead and we had a great season.
- Were you the fullback?
- No, I was the equipment manager.
- But that's not my point.
- Oh, come on, Norm.
You're wasting your breath.
He ain't bowling.
All right, think about that, Woody.
Go team!
Yeah!
Not too shabby.
Old Towne Tavern!
Old Towne Tavern!
Old Towne Tavern!
- Old Towne Tavern!
- Quiet, you guys.
Let's show our worthy opponent a little courtesy.
Back off, buster, or I'll put Vaseline in your finger holes.
Just try to touch my ball.
I'm talking about your nose.
- Choke on it!
- Choke on it!
You got the cheering under control.
I'll mosey up to the bar for a beer.
- You're gonna miss the game, Norm.
- Then that's a perfect plan, huh?
Hey, Cliffie, how're we doing here?
Fifty pins down, sinking like a stone, Sammy.
Norm!
How the hell they know him here?
He's got a life, you know.
That's all right, man.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Hey, Tawny, has anyone ever told you you make even bowling shoes look sexy?
Don't you ever stop?
You're fraternizing with the enemy.
No, I'm just trying to distract her here so she won't know what to do.
A little wink, a sexy nod, and a glimpse of these taut athletic buns.
Oh, wait a second here, Tawny.
Oh, what's this?
I think your butt needs a tune-up.
- Sam.
- Hey, what're you doing here?
I'm here as a driver only, but I brought someone with me who'd like to bowl.
- Woody!
- Woody!
Hey, time out, Gary.
- Who's taking care of the bar here?
- Oh, don't worry.
We closed it.
We would have been here sooner, but it took a while to get those people out.
Oh, well, great.
Yeah.
All right, go get some shoes on here.
Woody!
- What made him change his mind?
- I don't know.
He was right in the middle of doing something and he said, "l can't let the guys down.
Let's go".
Hey, Woody!
How are we gonna do this?
We've already started here.
Cliff, what about your wrist injury?
- What injury?
- Don't make me hurt you.
Easy, easy.
Gary, we're gonna need an injury substitution here.
Hey, you got it.
The one thing I've never been called is unfair.
I can believe that's the one thing you've never been called.
All right, I'm gonna go fire Woody up here.
The alleys.
Thanks.
It's really a sensory experience, you know.
The scent of Aqua Net on a beehive hairdo.
The roar of polyester against old Naugahyde.
The sight of a cigarette stubbed out in a patty melt.
All this, plus the anticipation of placing your feet in shoes only 7,000 others have worn before you.
Woody!
Yeah!
All right!
Let's go!
Listen, if this is gonna be tough on you, I want you to know that you don't have to do this.
No, I want to, Sam.
You're absolutely sure?
Oh, I'm sure.
You all have been like family to me.
I love you guys.
Okay, all right, Woody.
- Watch this, Gar.
- Yeah.
If you're having second thoughts, that's okay, pal.
No, no, I want to do this.
- Okay, I'm ready.
- All right.
All right.
- Woody?
- I wanna do this, Sam.
Remember, I love you guys.
I'm ready, Sam.
It's okay, Woody.
I'm gonna bowl.
I don't know what I was worried about.
This is easy.
Those guys are dead meat.
You know what I'm saying, Sam?
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Old Towne Tavern!
Old Towne Tavern!
Old Towne Tavern!
Old Towne Tavern!
- Hey, nice game, Sam.
- Oh, get out of here.
We said two out of three, and we're taking you to the wall.
That's right!
All right, all of you in favour of saving what shred of dignity we have left and sneaking out of here, raise your hands.
That's one Hey, how come you voted?
You're not even playing.
I thought we were ordering pizza.
Sam, we can't quit.
Listen, Sam, maybe we can sweeten the pot a little.
- Get out of here, will you.
- No, no, no.
If you guys win, I'll set you up with Tawny.
Maybe we can talk.
And if we win, you set me up with the Sweetheart of Sigma Chi.
Excuse me.
I didn't date Sigma Chis.
I was Phi Epsilon Delta.
You girls had quite a reputation.
Yes, for academic achievement.
Is that what it was?
Tell me, isn't it true that Phi Epsilon is Greek for "Hi, sailor"?
Give me your shoes.
Give me your shoes.
- Oh, Diane, are you bowling?
- Yes.
- Come on.
Well, are you any good?
- Yes.
And if you whisper a word of this to anyone who matters, I'll find you and I'll kill you.
Did you think I came by my utter contempt for the sport by accident?
Hardly.
I took it in college.
- You bowled in college?
- Yes.
I needed the PE credits.
I could read between frames, and you didn't have to run.
I spent six semesters sweating in a tawdry bowling alley.
Bowlers don't sweat.
They do when they're wearing tweed.
In spite of my complete disdain for the experience, I have no intention of letting this lvy League lounge lizard insult me and my sorority sisters and send Cheers to ignominious defeat.
Your mama!
Chambers!
Chambers!
Chambers!
Chambers!
Chambers!
- Chambers!
Chambers!
- Thank you!
Thank you!
Now put me down!
I'm afraid of heights, and someone has very cold hands.
Okay, everybody, line up.
I'm pouring beers.
I gotta hand it to you, Whitey.
For once, you did something that didn't make me wanna shove a rat in your mouth and sew your lips shut.
Such praise.
I blush.
- Congratulations, Sam.
- Yeah.
Thank you.
Oh, excuse me.
Continue celebrating.
Huzzah, huzzah.
- It was a great win, wasn't it, Sam?
- Yeah, it was.
- Thanks to you.
- Oh, don't thank me.
I've been amply rewarded just seeing how well you're taking this.
The old Sam Malone would have died before letting a woman salvage his athletic pride.
- You've grown.
- You know something?
I think I have.
Oh, by the way.
Tawny wasn't the only one looking sexy out there in bowling shoes.
Well, thank you.
No, oh, no, no.
I was talking about me.
You know, I'm surprised you didn't mention something.
No, seriously, seriously.
Great form out there.
- Thank you.
- No, no, I was still talking about me.
All right, all jokes aside here, thank you very much for helping me beat Gary.
Well, I was getting tired of listening to some ignorant blowhard take himself and some stupid competition so seriously.
Boy, he really does that, doesn't he?
No, I was talking about you.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
Okay, Mr Peterson, it's your turn to send a tape-recorded hello to my folks back home.
I don't know what to say here, Woody.
Just hurry it up, will you.
I've got some audio gems that'll have them howling in the old Hoosier state.
Okay, just let me find the end of Miss Chambers' message here.
Alrighty.
Your son is a hardworking young man.
You should be proud.
We at Cheers certainly are.
And what's more-- I think it's a little further along here.
I believe it was Elizabeth Barrett Browning who said-- Now let me tell you a little bit about myself.
All right, fill me up, Woody.
I think we're in here for a while.
Okeydokey, Mr Peterson, found the end of Miss Chambers' message.
It's ready to go.
Hi, folks.
This is Norm.
Oh, no, that's the end of the tape.
Sorry you didn't get to leave your whole message.
That was the whole message.
Oh, thanks.
Sam, two Beefeater martinis, please.
Well, you're just bubbling with energy.
You must've mastered the childproof cap on your Flintstones vitamins.
That's pretty cute, Diane.
Scored again.
Yeah, I guess I'll be saying that a lot tonight.
You got an evening of romance planned, Sam?
Yeah, I sure do.
Who's the bimbo du jour?
That's the girl, all right.
Claudia's been a tough nut to crack.
But tonight's the night she's gonna be enjoying all the rides in Sammy's magic kingdom.
She's in for a Mickey Mouse evening with Goofy as her guide.
Boy, Sam, I wish I could read women like you.
I mean, I can never really tell when a woman likes me.
Well, Woody, women give off different subtle signs of interest.
Me, I stand there naked with a rose in my teeth.
I'll watch for that one.
So, Sam, what signal is your date giving you?
Not only is Claudia mentally undressing me, she's mentally fixing me breakfast the next morning.
I'm sorry this is taking so long here.
I hope you're not getting bored.
Oh, no.
I enjoy watching you work.
I'm glad to hear that.
I've got some mirrors at home.
We can both watch.
One second.
Yeah.
Yeah, as a matter of fact he is.
Hold on one second, will you.
Cliffie, telephone.
Somebody wants to talk to Cliff?
Cliffie.
This is a first, bud.
I don't think anyone's ever called you here before.
Yeah, I know who this is.
It's a tootsie on my route who's been eyeing the cut of my jib through her Levolors.
Her old man's probably out of town, she's looking for a little C.O.D.: Cliffie on demand.
I know how to handle this babe.
Hello.
Listen, I never wanna speak to you again as long as I live.
Goodbye.
- Who was that?
- That was a man who has the nerve to call himself my father.
He'd have to have nerve to admit that.
Are you still carrying a grudge?
Damn straight.
How would you feel if your father deserted you at the formative age of 9?
Cliff, don't you at least wanna hear what he has to say?
- Perhaps he's trying to make amends.
- No way.
I don't wanna have anything to do with that bum.
Well, I know how these father/son relationships can be.
My dad didn't want me to get serious with Vera.
- He heard she had loose morals.
- You're kidding me.
Actually, he got the story wrong.
Turns out she had loose molars.
At least you had a father figure, Norm.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, well.
- Sam.
- Five minutes, we'll be out of here.
What's this?
A date of yours reading Artforum magazine.
And it's right side up too.
Hope this doesn't mean that we're gonna have to talk afterwards.
Why do I keep trying to communicate with you?
It must be the Margaret Mead in me.
That's a wonderful issue.
Yes, it is.
Did you happen to read their article on Chinese tapestries?
- Yes, it was fascinating.
- Wasn't it?
Yeah, the only problem was that 20 minutes later, I wanted to read it again.
Reads and has a sense of humour.
Did you lose a bet?
Excuse me?
- I'm Diane Chambers.
- Claudia Mitchell.
So you and Sam are going out?
Yes, we're gonna try that new lndian restaurant, Rajah's.
Oh, I understand their chef is a master of tandoori cooking.
Well, I don't really know that much about lndian food.
It's the one area where I'm not really able to be pretentious.
Well, I am, so we have the bases covered.
- Mind if I sit down?
- Please.
Oh, yeah, and after all, the game of billiards was invented by the ancient Phoenicians, Norm.
Well, however, it did gain newfound popularity after a group of Benedictine monks invented felt.
Thank you, Sam.
Good Lord.
I think that's my father.
There's still time to slip out the bathroom window.
No, no, no.
I wanna hear what the rat has to say.
Don't let out who I am.
- Can I help you?
- Do you happen to know Cliff Clavin?
I I Sam, I'm no good under pressure.
- Hi, I'm Sam Malone.
I'm the owner.
- Oh, hi.
I'm Cliff Sr, his father.
I called his ma, she said he hangs out here sometimes.
Is he around?
Well, no.
Actually he's not.
I think he's away on business.
- Yeah.
- Too bad.
I wanted to talk to him.
It's funny.
My own son.
I don't even know what he does for a living.
I don't even know what he looks like.
Cliff might be away for a while here.
Is there any message you'd like me to give to him?
I'll hang around a while.
It's kind of personal.
I'd like to deliver it myself.
- Oh, yeah, here you go.
- Oh, thanks.
Excuse me.
I got something to say.
Could I have the sports page?
Oh, yeah, sure.
Here you are.
Boy, you two seem to be getting along.
- Are you ready?
- Oh, not to mention willing and able.
I'll be at the Hey, I have this great idea.
Why don't we invite Diane to come with us for dinner.
- What?
- No, I don't think that'd be a good idea.
No, don't be silly.
It would be perfect.
Diane knows all about lndian food.
Oh, hey, so do l. I'll order buffalo, you can have the Geronimo burger.
Claudia, I really don't want to be a third wheel.
- Yeah, but I want you to come.
- Yeah, but I want us to be alone.
Well, there's plenty of time for that later.
Besides, what could you do in a restaurant full of people?
You'd be surprised.
- Yes, you would.
- Why don't you just butt out of this-- Look, Sam, I think you're being kind of a drip about this.
Quite frankly, I am surprised at you.
Oh.
Well, all right.
Diane, if you have nothing better to do than tag along, why don't you join us.
- I really don't think-- - No, please, Diane.
I insist.
- lt'll be fun.
- Yeah, loads.
- Great, then we're set.
- Okay.
- I'm gonna go freshen up.
- Okeydoke.
- Please get me out of this.
- No, no.
If you don't go, she'll think that I told you not to go.
And then she's gonna think I'm even a bigger heel.
You're going.
Okay.
Fine.
Fine.
You bet, "Fine.
Fine".
Give me the phone, will you.
- Sam, you're out of your mind.
- Hey, please.
I may look stupid, but I'm way ahead of her.
Give me some credit for having brains.
Hello.
Hello.
Yeah, this is Sam Malone.
I made a reservation for two at 7::00.
I wanna make sure it's an intimate table that seats only two.
Yeah, and there'll be a third person coming along, but I wanna make sure that she's seated far away.
Yeah, no, no.
The farther the better.
In fact, do you have something in Bombay?
- Goodbye.
- You're a genius.
I kind of think I'm wasting my time here.
If Cliffie comes in, tell him I was here.
Thanks for the beer.
- Aren't you gonna say something?
- I've got nothing to say.
Mr Clavin, maybe Cliff will call you later.
Well, he'd better make it fast.
I'm leaving tomorrow.
Gee, it's too bad.
I'd really like to make my peace with the kid.
Well, thanks anyway.
Hold it right there, Clavin.
I'm Cliff Clavin Jr. You're Cliff.
You wasted your time coming here.
After what you've done, there can be no peace between us.
Hit the bricks.
Cliffie.
- What?
- What's that?
- Where?
- Gotcha!
Oh, Dad, you always knew how to push the right buttons.
Hey.
I just can't stop talking about that meal.
It was simple and delicate, yet provocative.
Well, I never had anything quite like that lamb vindaloo.
Great recommendation, Diane.
How was your meal, Sam?
The only thing that tasted good at the table turned out later to be a candle.
You're not still angry about sitting alone?
I wasn't alone.
You're forgetting about that 300-pound Hindu with the goitre that kept fanning me.
Look, Sam, I know this date hasn't turned out the way you planned it.
Well, maybe we could still salvage something of the evening.
Maybe we could go someplace for dessert.
If I might make a suggestion, why don't you two go upstairs to Melville's.
They have great cheesecake.
I have a better idea.
Why don't we go over to my place for a little Sammy's jubilee.
The beer distributor, he says there's some problem with next month's order.
Well, let him talk to Woody.
Woody handled it last month.
I think that's the problem.
Damn.
All right, listen.
We'll go up to Melville's for your cheesecake, but then we're going to my place for your beefcake.
You've got some work to do, don't you?
- Evening, everybody.
- Norm!
- Norman.
- What's your pleasure, Mr Peterson?
Boxer shorts and loose shoes, but I'll settle for a beer.
So how was the Hungry Heifer?
- It wasn't too good.
- No?
Well, what'd you have?
Well, I got the chef's special ribs.
- That sounds pretty good.
- That's what I thought, but the chef just came out and made fun of my tie.
- So Cliffie and his dad not back yet?
- Oh, no, they had very big plans.
Mr Clavin wanted to spend the evening getting to know his son.
Yeah, and the rest of his life trying to forget.
Woody, next time you order beer from the distributor, try to be a little more specific than "lots".
- Sorry, Sam.
- That's all right.
I called Melville's.
They have just two pieces of cheesecake left.
No more.
No less.
No Diane.
Boy, next to Sammy's life, my life sure looks dull, doesn't it?
Next to a barnacle my life seems dull.
Say, you know, that cheesecake can be pretty fattening.
You got any ideas how we could work it off?
- May I say something to you, Sam?
- Please.
You know, the first few times that we went out, I thought you were coming on a little strong.
I now miss those gentler times.
Claudia, trust me.
You're about to come upon the gentlest time that you've ever known.
Good Lord, Sam.
What?
That was good.
I'm afraid we're just not what each other's looking for.
All right, maybe you're right.
Oh, wait, listen, here.
I wanna wish you a happy life.
As happy as you can be without me.
There are no hard feelings here, are there?
No, no, on the contrary.
I'm glad that this happened.
Because I feel that everything, no matter how degrading and humiliating, should be experienced at least once in life.
Well, wait a second, here, Claudia.
Let's talk about this.
Claudia.
Claudia left rather abruptly.
She didn't even say goodbye.
Was she upset about something?
Yeah, she was upset about something.
Your little plan worked perfectly.
What are you talking about?
I can't believe you're actually making me say this.
- What?
- Why don't you just admit you're nuts about me and you can't stand me going out with other women so you try to eliminate the competition.
Sam, your hormones have staged a coup d'√©tat on your brain.
No, no, no.
Don't try to distract me with hormone talk.
Well, as long as we're talking about transparent plans, why don't you just admit that you brought that clone of me here because you are still hung up on me.
Are you kidding me?
There is only one reason why you came back here.
Because you asked me.
I asked you, you begged to come back.
We're splitting hairs here.
Sam, Melville's want to know if you still want that cheesecake.
Yes, I want that cheesecake.
Tell them I'll be right up.
I'm gonna go up and have that cheesecake all by myself.
It'll be the best company I've had all evening.
Indeed.
Unless you wanna come along and make the evening a complete disaster.
I wouldn't have cheesecake with you if you were the last man on Earth and it was the last morsel of food.
I'm getting kind of used to eating by myself anyway.
Well, it is delicious cheesecake.
Does your offer include coffee?
Maybe.
- And a refill?
- Don't push it.
Sam I am sorry that you had to eat alone.
That's okay.
What did you guys talk about anyway?
Well, we talked about the postmodernists and the trend away from minimalism in literature.
All of a sudden, my table doesn't seem so bad after all.
And he says, "Yeah, my sister".
His sister!
Time for a little in-flight refuelling here.
Oh, good.
Now you're good for another 1,000 miles.
You two look like you've been having a heck of a time.
What did you do?
- lt'd be better to ask what we didn't do.
- Yeah.
How about if we just withdrew the question.
We caught the first quarter of the Celtics game, went down to the petting zoo.
It was night, but we peeked over the fence.
Then we went fishing and Dad took me to the all-night barber's to get a haircut.
Yeah, next time he's gonna get them all cut.
Then later, we had a father-and-son talk about the birds and bees.
Yeah, well, I already knew about that stuff.
There was one thing that was a little bit shocking.
Excuse me, Daddy.
I gotta make a pit stop.
Yeah, yeah, go right ahead.
I'll refuel a little myself.
Tell me about Cliffie.
You guys know him a lot better than I do.
- Is he really as nice as he seems?
- Oh, you bet.
And smart too.
One of the smartest guys I've ever met.
And dependable.
You call Cliff at 4::00 in the morning, he's there.
Where the hell else would he be?
Hey, Mr Clavin, do you have the gift of gab like your son?
No, it comes from his mother's side.
She's the real yapper in the family.
My God, she gets rolling, she's like a hyena on bennies.
Hey, Dad, come on.
Time's a-wasting.
What do you say we go out and get a set of matching tattoos?
Cliffie, I gotta get cracking.
I got a plane to catch.
Come on, Dad.
So much time, you know, we haven't talked.
- We don't know about each other.
- Cliffie.
- I just had a terrific idea.
- Oh, yeah?
What's that, Dad?
Why don't you come to Australia with me.
Australia?
I don't know if I can leave all this.
My friends, my job.
You can make new friends, and you don't need a job.
- What?
- I got a lot of dough stashed away.
- Well, I need time to think about it.
- There's no time.
I got to go now.
What's the rush?
I have got to get out of this country as fast as I can.
- What's going on?
- Okay, listen.
I'll level with you.
You're my son.
I can trust you.
My business has gotten me in a little trouble with the law.
- What kind of business is that?
- Real estate fraud.
- Dad, that's illegal.
- Good, I'm not going too fast for you.
Listen, come on, you gonna come with me?
No, no, look, Dad, I can't let you do this.
How about you give the money back, throw yourself at the court's mercy.
They'll let you off with 1 0 years max.
Ten years.
Come on, grow up, will you.
We're talking about heavy cake here.
Now, I want you to come.
Are you gonna come or no?
Well, how do you know I'm not gonna turn you in?
Cliffie, you're not gonna turn in your own father.
I know that and you know that.
Yeah, you're right, Dad.
I had a couple beers.
I'm gonna make one more stop and then I'm gone.
Give me the phone.
What's wrong?
My old man's a crook.
He's leaving the country one step ahead of the law.
You're not gonna rat on your old man!
Think about this, will you.
Got nothing to think about now.
Information?
Yeah, give me the federal authorities.
I don't know.
Somebody in charge of rotten daddies.
I can't do it.
I've aided a fugitive from justice.
I'm a disgrace to my uniform.
Hey, come on.
Come off it, Clavin.
You didn't disgrace anything.
You can't turn the old guy in because you love him.
Now, anyone would understand that.
Thank you, Carla.
You're right.
I do love him.
Matter of fact, I think I'll go give him a big hug right now.
It might be a little uncool to hug him in the men's room, you know?
I guess you're right, Norm.
What the heck.
I can't wait.
It's the longest we've been apart all day.
Carla, you know, for a minute there, you treated Cliff as if he was a human being.
What you are experiencing is a half-melvin.
You breathe one word of this and I am going to give you a full-melvin.
I think we understand each other.
He's gone.
This is all that's left.
What do you suppose happened to him?
It's obvious, isn't it?
My father didn't trust me, so he gave me the slip out of the bathroom window.
Guess I'll just go home.
You're ruling out the other possibility.
What other possibility?
Well, it's a little-known fact, but more and more people have been going into men's rooms and vaporizing.
I mean, just disappearing into thin air.
It's an unexplained phenomenon.
- It's kind of like the Bermuda Triangle.
- That's right.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Get serious, will you.
Have it your way.
Well, you know, however, this much is true, you know.
There's been recent sightings of human beings being shot up into the underbelly of alien spacecraft.
You know, and speaking of the Bermuda Triangle, - it's not technically a triangle.
- It's not?
Heck, no!
It's a trapezedo-rhomboid.
They're perfect for attracting Martian spacecraft.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
- All right, 1 955 AL MVP.
- Yogi Berra.
All right, height of the left field wall at Fenway.
- The Green Monster is 37 feet high.
- Told you.
All right, here you go.
- lke Delock's lifetime ERA.
- 4:03.
Had enough?
Give it up, Norm.
The woman's a lean, mean trivia machine.
- Unbelievable.
You're the best.
- I know.
- Ask me something.
- Forget it, Zeke.
There aren't any questions about wheat in there.
Oh, and I suppose you know everything that's in this book.
- If it's in there, I know it.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
What's the Library of Congress card catalogue number?
Seven, eight, zero, three, four, seven, six.
- That's not even close.
- What do you mean?
Look there.
What?
That's it exactly.
Hey, everybody.
Guess what I grew in my greenhouse?
Not another potato that looks like Richard Nixon.
No, I learned the error of my ways there.
Yeah, I guess I was pretty off the deep end then, huh?
No, but this is nothing like that.
Look at that.
A map of the Hawaiian lslands.
See the little bumps in the exact shape and formation of our 50th state.
Come on, Cliff, don't make me look, please.
Normy, Normy, this is one of nature's fascinating little mutations here.
Resting in the hands of one of her bigger ones.
All right, no skin off my nose.
I'll just put it in the bag and take it on home.
Hey, guess what's in the bag.
"Human Sexuality"?
You don't have to broadcast it.
It happens to be assigned reading for a required course.
You're blushing.
I am not blushing.
I prefer to maintain a sense of decorum, unlike you who brought in coloured slides of your wedding night.
They were a big hit.
And your break was over ten minutes ago.
Oh, Carla, please.
I have to come up with a topic for my psychology paper by tonight.
I'm at a complete loss.
Of course I could turn out your run-of-the-mill essay on sadomasochism, bestiality, bondage and discipline but I'm looking for something with a little pizzazz.
- Hello, everybody.
- Oh, Sam.
Would you please see if you can light a fire under the stick?
She's been goofing off for an hour.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
She's gotta write some paper about sex and she can't think of anything to write about.
You're kidding me.
She studied for a whole year at Sammy State.
Hey there.
I hear you're writing a paper on sex.
- Is there any way I can help out?
- Thank you, Sam.
This paper is on human sexuality.
No, come on, I'm serious.
I want to help.
Well, it had occurred to me to use you as a case study, but I lack the proper clinical distance, so that's out of the question.
What are you talking about?
You got an A plus staring you in the face, here.
Come on, we're pals, aren't we?
Come on, let me feel useful.
Well, you would be an interesting study.
Great.
Kind of slow in here, why don't you step into my laboratory.
Well, all right.
I am desperate.
Sam this has to be done in a professional manner.
I hope you'll take this seriously.
I'm only this far away from a master's degree in-- Well, 37 different subjects.
But if I do well in this class, psychology could well become my major major.
Wow, and we were here, huh, Cliff?
We're always here.
Sam, before we start, I want to warn you.
This will be frank and candid.
We may be touching on some highly sensitive areas.
I like the sound of it already.
Go ahead.
Go ahead.
Okay, why don't we start with your parents.
Would you describe them as physically demonstrative?
I'm here, aren't l?
They must have been.
But why are you asking me about my parents?
I'm asking about your parents to lay a psychological foundation - for your later behaviour.
- Boy, this isn't as much fun as I thought it was gonna be.
When are we gonna get to me?
Okay, why don't we jump to your relationships outside the family.
Yeah.
At what age did you have your first sexual encounter?
That's more like it.
Okay.
"Trevor, a Case Study".
Who's Trevor?
- That's you.
- You're not gonna use my name?
Of course not.
So I do all the work and this Trevor guy gets the credit?
Sam, this is not your r√©sum√©.
In a psychological treatise, real names are never used.
Yeah, but at least I should be able to choose my own name.
How about "Duke"?
- This is my paper, and I like Trevor.
- All right.
All right.
Let's see where were we?
You wanted to know about my first time, right?
Yes.
How old were you?
Boy, I'm not sure.
I know I couldn't get to her house until the crossing guard showed up.
Wow.
First time is kind of hard to remember.
- What about your first time?
- I'm the scientist, Sam.
My first time has nothing to do with this.
But just to lay the subject to rest it was the summer of my 19th year.
He was a young man in uniform.
It was a brief encounter.
He left my arms and went to his doom.
Oh, no, he was killed, huh?
No, no, he went off to boot camp and came back with the most God-awful haircut I'd ever seen.
Now, may we get back to you?
And limit your responses to attitudes.
Please leave out the gory details.
Now, what about your second encounter?
Well, that would be the crossing guard.
So, Woody, ready to take on Carla in the sports trivia contest?
Yeah, well, now, I've been studying all week long, so go ahead.
- Test me.
- All right.
In what game did Ted Williams break his elbow.
Ted who?
I'd take another quick peek in the book, Woods.
- Diane?
- Dr Greenspon.
What on earth are you doing here?
I just wanted to come by and tell you in person, I've read your paper, and I think it is absolutely extraordinary.
In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if The New England Journal of Psychology wanted to publish it.
Forgive me for losing my academic demeanour for a few moments.
- I'm sorry.
Sorry.
- That's quite all right.
- Would you like a drink?
- I'd love a beer, please.
Wonderful.
Coming right up.
Of course I do have a couple of reservations.
Well, the most significant concerns your psychological subject, Trevor.
Since you seem to have found such a near perfect example of Don Juanism, there are bound to be those who are going to doubt this paper's authenticity.
Doctor, I assure you, every word is true, although I understand your doubt.
It is hard to believe that such a man exists.
Doctor, have a seat over there for just a couple of minutes.
I'll join you soon.
There are a few things I have to do.
- Sam.
- Yeah.
Would you mind if I revealed your identity to my psychology professor, Dr Greenspon?
Mind?
Yo, doc, Trevor here.
- Alias: Sam Malone.
- Lowell Greenspon.
That's an amazing case history you have.
Yeah, isn't it?
Knock on wood.
So you'd say that the paper is accurate?
Well, now, we had to change a few of the names to protect the satisfied.
- Well, it's been very nice to meet you.
- Yeah, you too.
- Thank you, Sam.
- Yeah.
No, thank you very much.
What a find you have there, Diane.
So you really think it's publishable?
Well, that brings me to my other reservation.
- What?
- In Trevor, you've shown us the cause, yes?
What the paper lacks is the effect.
Now, if you could possibly find one of these conquests to learn why she's so gullible.
What gives her such low self-esteem so that she could possibly fall for this blatant manipulation.
I don't know.
Well, if you did, I don't see how the Journal could fail to publish it.
Hey, Woody.
Come on, buddy, get your nose out of that book.
How much more trivia can you cram into that head?
Yeah, maybe you're right.
My brain must be filled up, because my hair hurts.
Why don't you call Carla over before I forget everything.
Carla, you got a brash, young challenger over here who says he's gonna boot you off the top of sports trivia mountain.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
Well, he said it before and I've always left him bleeding in the dust.
I say, Jethro goes down in three questions.
Okay, everybody, gather around for the sports trivia championships.
- Give me your best shot.
- Okay.
What was the lowest round ever recorded in a PGA-sanctioned golf tournament?
- Fifty-nine, Al Geiberger.
- He's right.
All right.
Who was the oldest heavyweight champion?
- Jersey Joe Walcott.
- Yeah.
Bingo.
- All right, those were easy questions.
- Two for two.
You're gonna choke on this one.
Who was the only pitcher to ever lose a one-hitter in the World Series?
- Bill Bevans.
- He did it.
All right.
New York Yankees, 1947, against the Brooklyn Dodgers.
- All right.
That's good, Woody.
- Goodwoody.
Elmer Goodwoody, shortstop, Boston Beaneaters.
It's all right, buddy, take a rest.
Take A Rest, winner of the California Derby, 1 959.
Ten-eighty to win, six-forty to place, three-twenty to show.
- So you liked my rewrite?
- Oh, yes.
I just can't get over it.
I mean, who would have thought that this "Colette" that you described as "rapturously beautiful, intelligent, indeed brilliant with an ethereal quality" could be so easily manipulated by Trevor.
Trevor is not without his charms, crude as they may be.
Well, but they're so transparent.
The woman would have to be addled.
- She'd have to be totally lacking.
- Thank you.
Your point is made.
Oh, hi, doc.
- Oh, my, is that the paper there?
- This is it.
You know, I still haven't had a chance to read that.
- Mind if I take a look?
- You wouldn't enjoy it.
Oh, don't be modest, Diane.
I'm looking forward to your presentation of it in class tonight.
- Thank you, doctor.
- Tonight?
Hey, you know, wait a second, I'm the headline act of that thing.
- You mind if I sit in on class?
- Oh, Sam.
- You wouldn't enjoy the class, either.
- It's very dry and boring.
No reflection on you, professor.
I mean to someone of Sam's limited intelligence.
No reflection on you, Sam.
What I mean is, don't you have to cover for Woody tonight?
Oh, you're right.
Darn it.
Well, too bad, huh?
Doc.
Shoot, and that did sound like fun too.
Wait a second, I've got an idea.
Why don't you bring them all over here.
Kind of a field trip.
See Trevor in action.
We could hardly do that.
But I don't think some of the members would mind coming by for a drink after.
It would give them a chance to meet the clinical case in the flesh.
Oh, I'm not going to promise that.
We'll just see how the evening goes.
He's remarkable.
Sam.
- Sam.
- No, not now.
I'm going to prepare my lecture, here.
You know, it's about time I gave something back to the sport that's given me so much.
Sam, I think you should read this after all.
It's not what you think.
If you change your mind about the class coming here tonight, call me at home.
I'll understand.
"The Don Juan Syndrome in Modern Culture: An Analysis of Sat-- Sate-- Sater-- Satyriasis".
Oh, man, she did it.
She even made my sex life boring.
And not for the first time.
Excuse me, is there a Cliff Clovin here?
It's Cliff Clavin, partner, and you're looking at him.
Oh, hi.
I'm a reporter from the Chronicle.
You the guy that sent in this picture of a squash - with the Hawaiian lslands on it.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
What did I tell you guys?
This is one story they couldn't squash.
There you go.
To be honest, it's not the squash I'm looking for.
Actually, it's a part of a larger story on eccentrics here in Boston.
You know, the lunatic fringe.
Lonely people desperate for attention.
Yeah, yeah, but where do I fit in?
You come right after the old lady with the 84 snakes.
Okay, I'm insulted, and I'll thank you to leave this bar.
They don't pay me enough.
Cliffy.
All right, you stuck up to that guy.
- You didn't let him exploit you.
- Yeah.
Who the hell they think they're dealing with.
I ain't giving my squash second billing to a broad with a bunch of snakes.
Hey, how would you like to get a look inside that old bag's head, huh?
Professor Malone, I think you've got a little class in session there.
Hi, doc.
Over here.
Welcome, everybody.
Why don't you come over and take a seat anywhere over here.
There's no need to be so formal, but if you have something prepared.
Oh, just a few things off the top of my head.
Did you bring an apple for the teacher?
- Sam.
- Yeah.
I didn't hear from you, so I assume you read the paper.
Paper?
Oh, yeah.
Couldn't put it down.
Are you sure you still want to go through with this?
- Oh, absolutely.
- But, Sam, I don't feel this-- No, come on.
Take a seat here.
Don't want to be late for class.
Okay, sit down.
Welcome, everybody.
Now, I realize you came here to meet me and find out what makes a guy like me tick.
So I asked myself: "What makes you so different from everybody else when it comes to scoring big with women"?
And I think it's-- I think it's this: I love ladies.
I love the way they smell, the way they sound, the way they feel.
And by the way, that shade of lipstick really compliments that rosy glow on your cheeks.
- Unbelievable.
- Now, see, I'm not the only one who thinks that.
Okay.
All right, let's-- Enough about me here.
Let's open up this discussion a little bit.
- What's your name, son?
- Barry.
Barry.
All right, Barry.
Why don't you tell me what you do when you meet a girl for the first time.
Well, I talk to her and I let her know that I respect her as a human being.
I ask her out without putting any pressure on her, and I let the relationship grow naturally.
Well, we all have some pretty crazy ideas when we're young.
Okay, can anyone tell me where Barry went off the beam?
Miss Chambers has a thought here.
All right.
Well, all right, I guess so.
We can take five here.
Smoke them if you got them.
- You didn't read this, did you?
- Didn't have to, I lived it.
Sit down, please.
"Trevor is the image of the arrested adolescent, entirely self-oriented, still intimidated by the women around him and attempting to prove himself superior to them.
Through sexual conquest he can, for a time, quell his constant fears of inferiority and failure.
Indeed, the idea of a nonsexual relationship is completely foreign to him.
As the years pass and his physical attractiveness diminishes, he'll be doomed to a life of loneliness and despair, unable to give or receive love".
- Is this really how you feel about me?
- This is my clinical view of you.
As a woman, I might have felt something different than I feel as an academician.
It makes my life seem so cheap and pathetic.
- Sam, you're reading things into this.
- Like here where it says: "His life is cheap and pathetic".
Don't be hurt.
I hate it when you're hurt.
This is not a true picture of you.
I exaggerated in order to corroborate my thesis.
Boy, I don't know.
Maybe I am gonna end up this way.
You're not listening to me.
This is a paper.
Theory and conjecture.
I was going for a grade.
I told the professor what I thought he wanted to hear.
You're just saying that to make me feel better.
I mean, everything in here is true, including the part about I've never had a nonsexual relationship.
Now, there, that's a good example of exaggeration.
You and I have a nonsexual relationship.
How can you say that?
Well, I think that the fact that we don't have sex is a major hint.
That's just because we promised to try to keep our distance.
And we have.
Our relationship has reached the mature adult stage.
Well, I wish there were some way I could prove it to you.
Well, maybe there is.
Sit on my lap.
I'm just trying to convince myself that I can be close to a woman without it being sexual.
- This is the silliest thing I've ever-- - Hey, come on, Diane.
Well, if it'll help prove something to you, all right.
- Boy, you're nervous.
- I am not.
- There, we did it.
- Hey, come on.
Come on, you can't just get up like that.
That doesn't prove anything.
Come sit here, and let's just try to have a normal conversation.
There is nothing normal about this.
- What do you want to talk about?
- It doesn't matter.
Anything.
- How about the weather?
- Okay.
- Nice weather.
- A little nippy.
Well, that's because we're in Boston.
Now, if we were in, say, Tahiti.
- We'd be lying in the sun.
- Getting a tan.
Maybe even a sunburn.
Well, not if we rubbed oil all over each other.
What are we trying to prove again?
Something about that I can carry on a normal conversation - without it being sexual.
- Well, so much for the weather.
- Yeah.
- How about music?
- No, we don't like the same music.
- Well, we can talk about that.
- All right.
I like rock 'n' roll.
- I like classical.
- Harmonies.
- Grandeur.
- The hot guitar licks.
- The strings washing over you in a darkened concert hall.
The driving beat.
The low moan of the cello.
The drums, pounding, pounding, pounding.
- But if we don't agree, we don't agree.
- Yeah, right.
- What's that leave us?
- Religion.
Religion.
All right, the Bible.
- Adam.
- Eve.
- Fig leaves.
- Sin.
All right.
- Okay.
- Well, I think we've proved our point.
Clearly we have a nonsexual relationship.
And you are a fine human being.
- Well, thank you, Diane.
- So if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go out there and tell them my paper is completely invalid.
- There you go.
- Your knob.
Yes, I believe so.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
What can I get you?
What have you got?
Anything you want.
I'll bet you do.
Why don't you tell me.
Maybe you'd like to see a menu.
No, I don't need one.
I know what I want.
Are we talking about the same thing?
I think so.
Then maybe you'd like to whisper what you want in my ear.
Scotch and soda?
He's toying with me.
Chased out of the pocket, he's gonna throw it on the run, it's incomplete.
Good Lord, Sam, isn't this the tenth football game you've watched today?
It only seems that way.
That's the beauty of football.
Sundays.
The incessant drone of the television, the stench of beer and monosyllabic conversation.
That's it.
Get into it, girl.
Oh, Diane.
Listen, I dropped by to give you a bit of news.
I've decided to go away for a while.
I just wanna collect my thoughts and see if things look brighter from a new perspective.
Frasier, I think that's terrific news.
A very positive step.
I'm so happy for you.
Well, thank you.
I'm happy for myself.
Say, wait a second, Diane.
Crazy notion just jumped into my head, I don't know where it came from, but I was wondering if you'd like to come along.
I mean, after all, we do travel well together, and we have that matching luggage.
Frasier, I really don't think that would be a good idea at all.
Of course.
I understand.
Oh, Diane.
I've been putting off telling you something, but I feel I must now.
You've been using the word "really" far too frequently.
In fact, it's become really noticeable.
It's really quite maddening, really.
Frasier, I know you're disappointed that I didn't accept your invitation, but I really-- I don't think that's any reason to get on my case.
"Get on my case".
What a charming bit of slang.
Frasier, nitpicking at my choice of the correct modern English does not make you any more attractive to me.
If that's the purpose in your visits here, perhaps you should find another tavern in which to bore the life out of the clientele.
I'm so sorry to disappoint you, Miss God's-Gift-to-Men.
It just so happens that I come here to share the companionship of my male friends.
So, men, what's on the agenda tonight?
- Football.
- Oh, good Lord.
I mean, "Rah".
Using a colloquialism to ingratiate yourself with the rabble?
How very sad.
How really very sad.
Did you see that bootleg by Montana?
The guy's unstoppable.
Woody, looks like you're gonna win the bar pool today.
The Rams still have a chance, and if they make a comeback, - I take the pool.
- Woody, you know, if you win this, that's gonna make three weeks straight you've been in the money.
Yeah, yeah, I guess I'm on a streak.
You know, I've always been a lucky guy.
Back home I won a haircut.
The heck kind of contest was that?
Well, it wasn't really a contest.
It was just policy.
See, if the barber nicks your ear, you get a free haircut.
I think Schopenhauer put it aptly when he said: "Noise is the most contemptuous of all forms of interruption.
It is--" Impertinent.
Excuse me?
What you were trying to say was: "Noise is the most impertinent of all forms of interruption".
She said "contemptuous," can you believe that?
I thought I'd have a conniption.
Stop this quibbling at once.
As the only two entities of any discernible intellect in this place, it is our duty to set an example for the others.
You're only saying that because you know I'm smarter than you are.
This from a man who mispronounced "r√©moulade" at a dinner party.
Diane, I am fed up with the r√©moulade incident!
- lsn't it true?
- You are totally overblowing it.
Hey, hey!
Would you two cut it out.
You're drowning out a perfectly good tire commercial.
There's the gun.
Final score: 24 Yeah, all right.
There's the final.
Looks like you won, Woodrow.
- Hey, Woody.
- Hey, Woodrow.
Thank you very much.
I want you to know I couldn't have done it without all you guys because, well, this is your money.
Here you go.
Seventy-five big ones.
Paul, second place.
Twenty-five.
You did good, kid, but I still think I got a more reliable system.
Yeah?
I could really use one.
What's yours?
I just bet opposite whatever you pick.
So, Woody, what's this system you got up your sleeve there, huh?
- Yeah, Woody.
- Well, I don't actually have one.
I just kind of look at the picks and one team jumps out at me.
- He's got it down to a science.
- Really.
Imagine how much he'd have made if he'd parlayed some of those bets.
- What's that mean?
- Well, that's when you bet a series of games with a bookie.
I mean, you gotta win them all, - so the odds are pretty long.
- Do you guys know a real bookie?
I got a friend who's got a friend who's got a friend.
- And he's a bookie?
- No, but his friend is.
Wow.
You know, if I bet with a bookie, I'd have something to tell my grandchildren.
Sam, I don't think you should encourage Woody to pursue illegal activities.
Oh, lighten up, will you, Diane.
It's a part of a guy's passage into maturity.
You know, like going to a cathouse or whizzing off a balcony or mooning out of the back of a car.
Or on a really good night, all three.
- Yes, the triple.
- Triple.
Hey, why don't we-- Yeah, good idea.
I got the schedule for next week's games here.
Anything jumping out at you?
Oh, yeah!
These are the strongest feelings I've had yet.
- Well, what?
What do you got?
- What's up?
All right.
Indianapolis, Tampa Bay, Buffalo just hit me right in the eye.
Houston.
- Yeah, I'll bet.
- Yeah, I'll bet it did.
- What's so funny?
- All those teams you picked, they're a long shot, Woody.
He doesn't even know - what the point spreads are.
- What difference does that make?
I haven't looked at the point spreads all year.
Hey, Sam, I'd like to bet these teams with your bookie.
Okay.
All right.
How much you wanna put down?
Twenty, 30 bucks?
Thousand dollars.
You own $1 000?
Yes, ma'am, it's all my savings.
Woody, I'm not gonna let you throw away all your money on gambling.
You know, Woody, all that money on one shot, you gotta be nuts.
Yeah, why don't you sit down and give it a little thought here.
Excuse me.
I've been observing what's been going on over here and I have something to say.
Listen up here, Woody.
Do you realize that in the course of the evening, Diane has made 1 7 errors in the areas of grammar etiquette and statement of fact?
Frasier, your pedantry is insufferable.
And you suck eggs.
All right, Sam, I've thought about it, and I've decided - I definitely wanna make the bet.
- No, you don't.
Think some more.
Well, I'm the one who's been winning the pool.
And you know what I think?
You think I'm some dumb hick who can't make it on his own in the big city.
No, I don't.
I just think it's a dumb bet.
Case closed, Woody.
But it's my money and I'm willing to take the risk.
Woody, I can dig up a bookie somewhere.
- I'll make the bet for you.
- Woody, I'll make the bet for you.
Might as well keep it in the family.
- Sam - No, no.
You heard him.
It's his decision.
It's his money.
He's a grown-up.
- Where's your money?
- Thanks, Sam.
Come on, man, don't tell me you keep your money in your shoe.
Boy, you guys really do think I just fell off the turnip truck.
This is where I keep the map of where the money's buried in my backyard.
- Hey, is that him?
- Yeah, yeah, I think it is.
For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow For he - Good to see you all too.
- Sorry, Sammy, - we thought you were Woody.
- Can you believe it?
- The kid actually hit his parlay.
- I know.
Boy, that's fantastic, isn't it?
- Yeah.
- So, what is this?
- What are you guys doing?
- We're planning a little celebration - in honour of Woody's good fortune.
- A celebration, huh?
You mean like food, music, drink, that kind of thing?
We're not providing any of that, but we're hoping Mr Moneybags will spring for that when he gets here.
I don't think it's such a good idea to make a big deal out of this.
You'd just be encouraging him to gamble some more.
He won 10,000 bucks.
What more encouragement does he need?
- Oh, fine.
- Hey!
Thanks a lot, guys.
Hey, but guess what.
I've got some great news.
I won that parlay.
We know, Woody.
Congratulations.
Well, thanks, Miss Chambers.
- So, Sam, did my money get here yet?
- No, not yet.
They'll be bringing it pretty soon.
Matter of fact, I'll call right now.
Carla, why don't you start that celebration here.
Hi, everybody.
Diane, listen.
I'm here to tell you that I've just spent the most painful week of my entire life.
I was ice-fishing in subzero-degree temperatures in Nova Scotia.
I don't think I could have stood it for another minute, but it was worth it.
Because every iota of pettiness in me was left back on that frozen tundra.
So I'm here just to ask you to please forgive me.
- Apology accepted.
- lncomplete sentence.
Oh, my God.
I hope they're still biting.
What's this?
"Please" -something.
- Please get in here!
Sam, is this an M or a double N?
Just forget about that and sit down, will you.
I'm in big, big trouble.
I did something that-- It felt so right when I did it, but now it turns out to be all wrong.
What's her name, and how many months?
I never placed Woody's bet.
Oh, my God.
Sam, for the first time in your life you had the right intentions, and it still blew up in your face.
It was such a stupid bet.
I was just trying to protect him.
What am I gonna do?
I mean, I don't have $10,000.
Oh, dear.
Well, we know that Woody actually did pick the winning teams.
Yeah?
So?
- So why don't you go to the bookie - Bookie.
and tell him that you honestly intended to wager on the winning teams and see if he won't give you the money.
That's a good idea.
While I'm at it, why don't I just tell him that I meant to bet on - all the winning teams since 1975?
- Can you do that?
Please!
Well, Sam.
Why don't I just sound Woody out for you?
There's always the possibility that the money isn't important to him.
Yeah.
Maybe not.
Oh, that's a good idea.
Oh, thank you.
Sam, by the way, thank you for coming to me for advice.
I'm touched.
Well, if this works out, you will be.
Hey, Sam, that guy still didn't show up with the money.
- He is gonna give it to me, isn't he?
- Of course he will.
No bookie would welsh on a bet.
He'd be the lowest spitwad on earth.
Actually, murderers are lower.
You know, back home we'd take welshers, rub them with bacon fat and throw them in the sty with Romeo, the friendly hog.
- Well, gee whiz-- - Woody, why don't you and l - have a chat.
- Yeah.
- Oh, sure, Miss Chambers.
- There's a table right over here.
Woody I want to speak metaphysically.
And you need money for the language lessons.
No problem.
Let's start again.
What I'm talking about is the meaning of money.
What is it worth?
It can't buy love, it can't buy friends, it can't buy happiness.
Well, you're right, and I already have all those things.
So, in fact, you have everything.
And it wouldn't matter if you never got that money at all.
Oh, you're serious.
Oh, I'm sorry, Miss Chambers.
You see, it's just that my family never had a lot of money and still my folks were always making sacrifices for us kids, especially my mom.
I remember something she used to say to me, she'd say: "Woody, hold on to your dream.
I lost mine, but I want yours to come true".
It always made me sad to think of what Mom gave up for us.
What was your mom's dream?
To be a drummer in a power trio.
Her big hero was Ginger Baker in Cream.
Whenever we'd walk by the music store in town, she'd just stare and stare at the Ludwigs in the window.
I knew even though she was standing in front of Keller's Music, that in her head she was up on some stage banging out the solo in "Toad".
It must have been tough to go back to breading cutlets.
Now she's gonna get those drums.
And with heavy metal coming back, who knows what might happen.
Bless you, Woody.
Bless you, Miss Chambers.
How'd it go?
Not well.
Sam, I feel utterly defeated.
Here you came to me as a friend asking for my advice, - and I let you down.
- I know.
Is there anything I can do to help you in this time of crisis?
Not dressed.
What a shot!
Sam, maybe you ought to call the bookie again.
Sit down for a minute here, will you.
Woody, you know that old expression, "When you win a bet, you never get paid for eight days"?
- No, but I like it.
- Well, it's an old lrish expression.
Which is probably why the bookie hasn't shown up yet.
But you know what, it gives you an opportunity - to do some financial planning.
- Financial planning?
Yeah.
Yeah, you know, like spreading out the payments over a period of time, just like they do with the lottery winners.
- Lottery winners?
- Yeah, yeah.
All right.
Listen.
Here's my plan.
Now, I'll keep the $10,000 for you and I'll give you, let's say, $1 a week for 10,000 weeks.
Or, all right, maybe the deluxe plan.
Two bucks for 5000 weeks.
What do you say?
Well, it's a tough choice, but I think out of those, I'll stick to the whole thing at once.
- You're kidding me!
- No.
No, you're missing the obvious benefit of spreading out the tax burden.
- Am I right, Norm?
- Oh, yeah.
Great plan.
You'll be real happy you did it when you reach the age of 412, I think.
Let's talk, Woody.
Come on.
Sit down, Woody.
I've been trying to think of an easy way of saying this, but I don't think there is any.
I never placed your bet with my bookie.
Here's your thousand dollars back.
You never placed the bet?
No, I was trying to take care of you the way Coach used to take care of me.
And it worked out about as well, too, which scares the hell out of me.
Sam I wanna thank you.
You're welcome.
Oh, wait a second here.
Why aren't you going crazy?
Because it's the nicest thing that anyone ever did for me.
Are you kidding me?
I mean, not only did I not make the bet, I lied about it.
Woody, you should be going crazy.
It was for my own good, Sam.
Come on, man, don't do this to me.
You're out $10,000 because of me.
You couldn't have known how it was gonna turn out.
You thought I was gonna lose.
No, wait a second.
What difference does that make?
Come on!
Man, I cheated you out of $10,000.
I mean, who do I think I am?
You should wanna kill me, Woody.
It happened.
I really don't see the point in getting angry.
Now, you're not being honest.
Now, down deep, you're mad.
- You know you are.
- Maybe I am, just a little.
No, you mean, "Hell, yes, I am, Sam"!
Come on.
It was still the nicest thing that anyone ever did for me.
You're a great man, Sam.
Oh, man, you're hopeless.
Go on, get out of here.
At least let me feel like a jerk in private.
Sure, Sam.
- Sorry.
- No, don't say-- - Sam?
- What?
I can't stand to see you like this.
Would it make you feel better if I took the dollar a week?
Come on, man.
A dollar a week is meaningless.
How about a dollar a week and a raise?
Nice gesture.
Not good enough.
Okay.
How about a dollar a week, a raise and your Corvette?
My car?
Not a chance.
- Why not?
- Don't be ridiculous.
It's my car.
- But you owe me $10,000.
- I don't care.
I mean, it's my car.
But you said you wanted to make it up to me.
We're talking about my car, Woody.
I see.
You say you're sorry, you say you care, but when it comes down to it, - it's just a lot of lip motion.
- No-- Well, I think that stinks!
- That's good.
- You're nothing but a selfish, - lying creep!
- That's good.
That's good.
- You're angry now.
- Oh, you bet I am!
- Now I'm gonna go pack my bags.
- Oh, no.
Wait a second.
What are you doing?
What do you mean?
Oh, you're my boss and I yelled at you, I can't stick around.
Woody, Woody, Woody.
That was just a little yelling.
- Now, that doesn't mean anything.
- Well, no, but I've never yelled at anybody like that before in my life.
- We can't be friends anymore.
- Woody, come on.
Woody, friends yell at each other.
It's okay.
Coach and I used to fight all the time, but we were good friends.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Yeah, as a matter of fact, it made us closer sometimes.
- Oh, sure.
- No, I'm serious.
Come here.
Come here.
Listen.
Coach was a great peacemaker.
He had this little trick.
He'd You know, after a big fight, he'd make us put our arms around each other and sing "Home, Home on the Range".
- I know.
It sounds pretty silly, huh?
- Yeah.
Well, do it for me anyway.
Come on, Woody.
Come on.
Yeah, there you go.
Coach used to start me out on the first few notes.
Oh, give me a home Where the buffalo roam And the deer and the antelope play - How long we gotta sing this?
- Half an hour.
Coach said that if you could sing "Home on the Range" with a man for half an hour, you couldn't possibly hold a grudge.
Where seldom is heard A discouraging word And the skies are not cloudy all day - You feeling better?
- I still want your car.
Home, home on the range Where the deer and the antelope play - Coach's old trick.
- Oh, good.
Everything's okay.
A discouraging word And the skies are not cloudy all day Home, home on the range
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
- Hello, everyone.
- Hey.
Oh, come on, what kind of a greeting is that?
When Norm comes in, you all yell, "Norm," make a big fuss over him.
ls it asking too much for me to get the same treatment once in a while?
- She's right.
Try it again, sweetheart.
- Yeah.
Thanks.
- Hello, everyone.
- Norm!
That's better.
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!
- How's life, Mr Peterson?
- l'm waiting for the movie.
Normie, you're in early tonight.
Yeah, l wanted to talk to you guys before this evening.
What's this evening?
Well, l'm meeting a prospective client and his wife here.
He runs a huge dairy.
He's looking for someone to take care of his books.
All right.
He wants to squeeze a little bit more out of his taxes there, huh?
That's a very funny joke, Mr Clavin.
- You got any udders?
- "Udders".
All right, guys.
This is exactly the kind of sparkling wit that l'm talking about, okay?
Now, it's really important that l impress these people, so l'd appreciate it if you'd kind of leave me alone with the Brubakers.
Yeah, yeah.
Listen to the man, fellas.
Don't worry, Normie, l'll keep them away from us.
All right, Cliff, that last comment was specifically addressed to you, okay?
What are you saying, Norm?
What, you're ashamed of your best friend, huh?
Afraid l'm gonna embarrass you?
Afraid l'm gonna be a big bore?
Thanks for understanding, Cliff.
All right.
All right, Norm, my lips are sealed.
l'm mute.
You won't hear another word out of me on any subject.
How did you do it?
Sam, l'm going to have to take a couple hours off this evening.
Wait a minute.
Our absentee waitress strikes again?
What is it this time, bleach-bag?
Hey, hey.
Carla, do you mind?
l'm the employer here.
l'll handle this.
What is it this time, bleach-bag?
l volunteered to work the first two-hour shift on an auction for public television.
- You'll be on TV?
No kidding, huh?
- Yeah.
They're selling off celebrity belongings from the Boston area.
We have a baton that Leinsdorf used, a letter from Henry Cabot Lodge-- - And nothing from Sam Malone?
- Come on.
Not such a crazy idea.
As a matter of fact, some fellows named Yastrzemski, Bobby Orr, - something like Havlicek - Yeah.
have donated their athletic accoutrements.
Would you be interested, Sam?
Come on.
l mean, l was a good athlete, but, l mean, those guys are superstars.
Well, to some of us, you are too, Sammy.
Yeah, Sam, you may not have been out there as long as those guys, but you were loved.
- Please.
Please.
- Go ahead.
Don't be embarrassed.
No, no.
l mean, please, a little louder.
The rest of the bar didn't hear.
- Then you'll do it?
- Yeah, if it's for a worthy cause, l guess l could give them my old jersey.
You know, old number 1 6.
Yeah, l'm gonna do it.
l'll make a call, and-- You know, l'll tell you what.
lf this sells, maybe l could give them some more of my athletic equipment.
While you're at it, Sam, why don't you give them one of your old jockstraps.
No.
Too many memories.
Now, come on, all you baseball fans out there.
Our celebrities-- Hey, Sam, have they sold your jersey yet?
Are you kidding?
lt's been on sale for half an hour.
Sam's fans are probably clogging the switchboard.
Come on, Carla, let's not get carried away here.
- Mr Brubaker?
- Peterson?
Yes, Norm Peterson.
Yes.
Hi.
- This must be the lovely wife.
- Yes.
How do you do, ma'am.
Well, come on in, folks.
We have just a few moments till our table's ready upstairs.
And we can just have a drink here and get acquainted.
Just have a seat, folks.
This is Cheers.
l think you'll find it a friendly, warm, pub-like atmosphere.
l hate bars.
Well, l think they should be abolished, actually.
But we just have to be here a few moments.
Then we can go on upstairs and strap on the old feedbag.
- There are a lot of things l can't eat.
- Yes, we're both very careful.
Well, l have a very sensitive stomach myself, so Good news.
We just got in those taco- flavoured pork rinds you love so much.
Friendly serving wench, you know.
Now, come on, all you baseball fans out there.
l'm sure one ofyou wanna make a bid on this priceless piece ofbaseball memorabilia donated by ex-Red Sox star Sam Maloney.
- That's "Malone".
- Oh, yes.
Thank you for that.
Perhaps we should meet some of our volunteers now.
- And what is your name, miss?
- Diane Chambers.
l wasjust giggling with one of our callers over ajoke - that l'd love to share with you, Bob.
- Well, please.
How many Surrealists does it take to screw in a light bulb ?
- How many?
- The fish.
l guess Surrealistic humour isn't your cup offur.
Mr Brubaker, would you tell me a little bit about the dairy game?
l've always felt it must be really fascinating.
Really?
Why would you think that?
l Because of all the different products.
You have, you know, your milk, cheese and Now, we still have yet to receive a single offer for this authentic old baseball shirt.
Double-stitched.
A very nice garment, even ifyou're not a baseball fan.
- l have a bid, Bob.
- You do?
How much?
- A hundred dollars, Bob.
- Wonderful.
Well, there's a very generous offer.
Going once, twice, sold.
- Yeah!
- All right!
Yeah.
That's not too bad.
A hundred big ones.
- Yeah, way to go, Sam.
- Mayday's back, huh?
l just feel good to be able to do something to help out quality television.
l think maybe we should start watching this station more often.
Well, enough of this pledge break.
Let's get back to our program.
Hydro-Mulching: How Much?
How Soon?
Okay, wrestling.
- Hi, Sam.
l'm back.
- Hey, get in here.
So, what'd you think, huh?
Hundred bucks.
That's not too bad, is it?
Yes, the station asked me to convey their appreciation - to you for helping them out.
- Oh, well, l was glad to.
l mean, that's my favourite station.
- lt is?
- Yeah, yeah.
l especially like those two guys that talk about the day's events.
- MacNeil, Lehrer?
- No, no.
Bert and Ernie.
Oh, wait a minute.
Unless Maybe that's their last names.
- Could be.
- Anyway, listen.
l was thinking maybe l should donate a few more of my baseball treasures.
You know, like, l got some hats in here.
- No.
- Sam.
Sam.
- l really don't think that's necessary.
- Oh, hey, listen.
We got 1 00 bucks for my jersey.
We could be looking at a thou for the whole Sam Malone package.
Let me just call these folks here.
l bought the jersey.
- You did?
- Yes, l did.
Well, l know you don't like to sleep alone, but why didn't you come to me?
l couldn't bear just seeing it sit there and nobody bidding on it.
l felt sort of responsible, and the station let me buy it.
Well, why'd you do that?
l mean, you barely gave it a chance, really.
What difference does it make?
lt's over.
The station has their money, and you have your jersey back.
Well No, l want you to take that back.
Truth is, l haven't thought about baseball in a long time.
Seeing that jersey up there with all those great athletes' stuff just, you know, kind of got my juices going again.
Come on, take it back.
lt'll sell.
l know it will.
- Come on.
- Okay, Sam.
Sure.
- Maybe it will.
- Yeah.
- Maybe l responded prematurely.
- Thank you.
l'll leave it up there until it sells or ends up on Mr. Bobo's table.
There you-- There you go.
That's the spirit.
Diane?
Can l?
- Yes, Sam.
- l'm sorry, whose table?
Mr. Bobo's table.
- What's that?
- That's where things are put when they aren't sold.
- Well, then what happens?
- You don't wanna know.
Yes, l do.
Tell me.
ln the last ten minutes of the telethon, a chimpanzee, Mr. Bobo, draws viewers' names out of a coconut, and they give the things away.
You mean that egghead station of yours lets some dumb animal choose who gets the prizes?
That "dumb animal," as you called him, was part of a language experiment at Cornell University.
He has a vocabulary of 500 words.
Five-- Oh, come on, Diane, l find that completely - l'd better hurry.
- Yeah, hurry.
Wait.
Dubious!
Yeah, dubious.
Volunteers are standing by to take your calls.
Sam, l'm getting a little worried.
Nobody's made a bid on your jersey - since they put it back on sale.
- lt's only been an hour.
They just gotta give it a chance, that's all.
--keep this station alive.
Oh, and look who's here.
lt's Mr. Bobo.
lsn't he impressive?
We'll be seeing more of Mr. Bobo in the later stages of our auction.
Thank you for stopping by, Mr. Bobo.
You know, all of a sudden, l don't think l can stick it out and watch that old jersey sell.
l'm getting kind of sentimental.
Just wish somebody would buy the damn thing.
Oh, what are you worried about?
There are thousands of baseball fans out there who remember Sam Malone and who would kill to have a souvenir of him.
Carla, from your lips to God's ears.
l think somebody's making a bid there.
Well, this is interesting.
We have a lady on the phone who wants to buy old number 16 here for the sum of$200.
All right, huh?
That's just wonderful.
l'm going to tell Sam personally.
No, no.
No check.
l'll pay cash and pick up the jersey later.
Damn.
- lt's all right.
l don't blame you.
- Yeah.
After all, we both had the same fear, that it wouldn't sell, and you'd be humiliated.
Shamed.
- Disgraced in front of-- - Thank you.
Thank you.
You know, they used to cheer when l walked out of the bullpen.
l mean, just the sight of old number 1 6 would start them off.
Now, see, those were great days.
Yes, they were.
But you have more great days ahead.
You have a real job now, and friends.
And you've got your health.
God, that's low.
- What is?
- The health crack.
- Well, all l meant was-- - l know what you meant.
That was pity talking.
You don't tell somebody they still have their health unless what you mean is that's all they've got.
- Forget l said it.
- No, l'm not gonna forget it.
You told me l had good health.
l'm not gonna take that.
- Sam, you're sick.
- lt's too late to make up.
You know something?
You were pitying me, and if there's one thing l can't stand from you, it's pity.
You know, what the hell.
l'm gonna put that jersey back in the auction.
- And it's gonna sell.
- Well, l hope it does.
No, it's gonna sell because l said it's gonna sell.
Thank you very much for reminding me that l have a little self-respect left.
That l have some pride in who l am.
Hello?
l'd like to return that young man's jersey.
And so the woodchuck says to the lumberjack, "l was talking to the log".
l never much cared for jokes in which animals speak.
- Let's go.
- No, no.
Neither do l. l used that as a kind of awful joke a mediocre accountant might use.
Can we have some coffee?
What do you say?
No, thank you.
lt keeps me awake.
Well, l can see why you wouldn't want that.
No, sir.
Come on.
We haven't discussed business at all, sir.
l really think we ought to just have a spot of something.
What do you say?
- Well, l'd like a glass of water.
- Specialty of the house.
Come on, sit down.
Sit down, and l'll just run up to the bar and get it myself.
lt'll be much quicker that way.
Just keep the old party going, you know.
Cliff.
Man, l'm in Death Valley over here.
Help me out.
Woody, give me a glass of water.
Just help me out, will you?
Just come on over and just talk a little bit.
Who, me, Norm?
The laughingstock, windbag, the boob?
All right, l'm really sorry for whatever l may have said this afternoon.
l just didn't know what these people would be like.
Oh, yeah?
What are they like, Norm?
They're like Like dead people without the rouge.
Sorry, Norm.
Can't help you out.
All right, there's something you should know.
Listen, l found out over dinner that both their fathers were postmen.
Postal brats?
Normie, Normie, Normie, you should have said so.
Stand aside, me bucko, and l'll take care of the rest.
So your parents wore the colours, huh?
Well, l didn't follow my father into the service.
And Henry's in milk.
Oh, well, that explains the lovely complexion.
- Well, thank you.
- Oh, yeah, yours too.
So, you know, speaking of milk, here's a little-known fact.
The cow was domesticated by the Mesopotamians.
- Oh, no.
- Yeah, that's right.
In fact, it wasn't originally a milk-bearing animal.
Oh, no.
It was originally used as a guard animal for the Chinese emperors during the Chung King dynasty.
Just when you think you know an animal.
Well, allow me to elucidate.
Thank you, Norm.
Get me a beer, will you?
Yeah.
Theory was that the intruder would step on a cowpie - How we doing?
- Great.
- They keep talking about your jersey.
- Really?
And still no bids for the jersey time forgot.
- Donations can be made by check - I'd make a big donation if I could go a couple of rounds with that guy.
Sam, would you relax?
I'm your biggest fan, I'm not worried.
That jersey is gonna sell, and for a wad.
- You think so?
- Absolutely.
Money in the bank.
Just stop doubting yourself and trust me.
You're right.
What am I doing?
Woody, how much have we raised?
We got $116 and a pledge for a quart of buttermilk.
What are you do--?
What's going on?
Oh, Sam, we're just trying to help.
Well, I don't need your help.
Nobody goes near the telephone.
You hear me?
Nobody.
Well, I think we're gonna have to move on.
I'm afraid we're gonna have to take the Malone jersey off the bidding table to make room for this ingenious potato-powered clock.
We'll be seeing more of the jersey on Mr. Bobo's portion of the show.
One of the things folks love about public television - is the fact we show no commercials.
- Sam, I'm sorry.
That's okay.
Well.
This is it, huh?
The end of an era.
Well, maybe I can finally put my career in perspective.
Enjoy it for what it was.
I was a small player in a big town.
But that's okay.
That's okay.
I had-- I had some laughs, some good times, some bad times.
And now, I guess I'm no longer Sam Malone, ex-baseball player.
I'm Sam Malone, ex-ex-baseball player.
Just an average guy doing an average job.
That's something I can be proud of.
Hold everything.
We've had a $300 bid on Sam Malone's jersey.
All right!
Oh, I own this burg!
- Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
- Sam Did any of you do it?
Come on, just admit it if you did it.
Please.
Honest, Sam.
Nobody here bought it.
Hey, do you think we have enough for that potato-powered clock?
They bought my jersey.
Three hundred bucks.
Sammy, I got a great idea.
Why don't you call, have that guy who bought it come here.
- You could autograph it for him.
- You can take pictures, - send them to the newspaper.
- That's a good idea.
It's a terrible idea.
Sam, don't you see what's happening?
- What?
- This is a last desperate grasp - at glory that you just said was over.
- Oh, come on.
Lighten up, will you?
Do you have to take the fun out of everything?
Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot.
You do.
You're a delight, Clifford.
Oh, enchant√©, Enid.
Drive carefully, huh?
What?
What?
Where are they going?
Where are they going?
Henry's gotta get up early in the morning, and Enid's sciatica's flaring up again.
Oh, what that woman endures.
Forget her, what about me?
Did I get the job?
Oh, jeez, Norm.
Norm, I forgot to ask.
Hey, look, don't worry.
I'll bring it up this weekend.
This weekend?
Yeah, they invited me up to the farm.
Forty-eight hours of Charades, food and Yahtzee.
- Sam Malone?
-Yeah.
Hey, everybody.
- I want you to meet a Mayday fan.
- I'm Bert Simpson.
Bert, hi.
Sam Malone.
Oh, Diane, come on over here and meet Bert.
- Hello, Bert?
- How are you?
Well, this must be pretty thrilling for you.
- Did you see me pitch at Fenway?
- No.
- Caught me on the tube then, huh?
- Not really.
Actually, I've never heard of you.
But to tell the truth, I wouldn't know a baseball from a meatball.
Boy, catch me having spaghetti at his house.
Why don't you just let me sign that thing for you, and you can get the hell out of here.
I have no interest in that.
I thought you might like it back.
Why did you buy it if you didn't want it?
Oh, frankly, it was getting on my nerves.
I mean, the thing kept coming back.
Finally I said to myself, "It's for a worthy cause.
Put the damn thing out of its misery".
Excuse me.
Can I see you in my office?
Gee, Sam, I'm awfully busy right now.
No hurry.
Whenever you have a minute.
- Now, Sam-- - Relax, relax.
What's the matter?
You're upset.
You're humiliated.
And you're angry.
This shirt thing has been an emotional roller coaster for you, and you want someone on whom to vent your frustration.
Come on, take a look at me.
Do I look upset?
Do I look angry?
- Then why'd you drag me in here?
- Well, because I know that you were just dying to call me a big dope.
- No.
Not me.
- Yeah.
I thought I'd give you a chance to do it privately.
- I see what you're doing.
- What?
You want an excuse to blow up and let it all out so you'll feel better.
And you want me to provide the excuse.
Well, I'm not falling for that.
I am not gonna blow up.
I just think that we're not gonna be able to lay this thing to rest until you call me a big dope.
It's what's in your mind, so why not just say it.
Get it over with, and we'll go on with our lives.
No.
Well, I really wish you would.
I think it would be good for me to hear.
- Well, maybe you should-- - I knew it!
I knew it!
I knew you couldn't keep your big fat mouth shut.
Oh, God, you think you know everything, don't you?
In your entire life, you've never said, "I don't know," or, "I think this".
Or, "In my humble opinion".
Oh, no, you always just say this.
And you just say that.
This, that!
This, that!
You know, you're nuts.
You are crazy.
And in your twisted little mind, you probably think you're gonna make me crazy just like you made Frasier crazy, just like you make everybody crazy.
But you won't make me crazy.
You wanna know why?
I'm gonna tell you why.
Are you listening?
Here it comes.
I don't know!
I'll tell you something else.
You don't know either.
Nobody knows why you're not gonna make me crazy.
So stick that in your hat and smoke it.
- Thank you.
- Anytime.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
Woody, let me have a C.C., rocks Something with a twist and whatever else table ten was drinking.
Boy, your batteries are running low there, Carla.
I got two sick kids, kept me up half the night.
The neighbour's dog went into heat at 5:00 this morning.
And I am in the middle of a double shift here.
Well, on the bright side, you look like hell.
Oh, dear.
I think this calls for drastic measures.
- G-6?
- Yeah.
Oh, no.
Not G-6.
And leave it off.
Good lord, Sam, have you been swimming laps in that cologne of yours?
No, I just dropped the bottle all over the floor in there.
Another $2.50 down the drain.
Oh, the big bottle.
Hey.
Look, The Three Musketeers is coming on in ten minutes.
- All right.
- Oh, good for you two.
Excellent choice.
Of course, there's no substitution for the Dumas p√®re novel.
But all in all it wasn't a bad translation into film.
You better believe it.
I love all that duelling.
Yeah, and the best part is when Curly backs into that guard's sword and makes that "boing" sound.
What makes me think we're not talking about the same film?
- She probably likes Shemp.
- Right.
Is it possible that occasionally you people might spend an afternoon doing something that actually involves intelligent thought?
- Like what?
- I can't conceive.
And we can all breathe a sigh of relief for that.
Actually, just observing people can be very interesting.
Don't you ever make up little stories about the people you see in the bar?
Nope.
Well, for example, this couple over here.
What's their story?
That's a guy and a girl having a drink.
Fascinating.
Come on, you can do better than that.
Just use a little imagination.
Okay, that's a guy and a naked girl having a drink.
That's funny, right?
No kidding, fellas.
That was really nifty.
I appreciate you taking me.
Where did they take you, Woody?
Well, we watched the Greater Boston Women's 1 0K run.
I should've known.
No, now wait a minute.
Hold on there, Diane.
We happen to think it's inspiring to watch a bunch of women excel in a sport from which only until recently they've been barred from competing.
Well, I'm sorry, Clifford.
I guess I misjudged you.
Besides, there wasn't a bra on the field.
It was an awfully chilly morning, if you know what I mean.
More coffee for Chuckles.
Who?
That guy over there.
Haven't you noticed him?
He's been sitting there for a couple hours drinking coffee and staring at us.
So, what's the problem?
I'll tell you what's the problem.
He doesn't smile.
He doesn't talk.
He looks at me like I'm not there.
You'd think I'd slept with him or something.
So what?
He's not bothering anyone.
He's bothering me.
He gives me the creeps.
Look.
See that?
He's writing something down.
- Now, what do you think he's up to?
- Come on.
For all we know, he's writing down a shopping list.
Well, here's the perfect chance for us to play our little game.
Oh, yeah?
What game's that?
Well, we were just fantasizing about customers in the bar, making up little stories about them.
Two beers, Woody.
Well, he's probably a writer or a poet or something.
Oh, that's very good.
What do you think he's writing, Woody?
Well, I hope he's not writing about a boy and his dog who roam through the countryside doing good deeds and drinking beer.
Why?
Because that's the story I'm writing.
He's still looking at us.
So, what's the big deal?
As long as he's minding his own business.
That's just it, Sam.
He's not minding his own business.
It's like he's spying on us.
See that?
He just wrote something else down.
There's an easy way to figure out what he's up to.
- Somebody just go ask him.
- Oh, let me.
All right.
I'm from the Midwest, and we have kind of a down-home charm that makes people kind of open up to us.
Howdy.
I'm Woody Boyd from Hanover, lndiana.
That's the place mat capitol of the world.
My mother's name's Margaret and my father's name's Edgel.
My favourite colour is blue and I've saved all my baby teeth.
How about you?
Go away.
What'd you find out?
I've lived kind of a dull life.
Look, what's he doing now?
I'd say he's fixing a cigarette lighter of some sort.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Perhaps to the terminally naive.
Those of us in the know can spot a highly sensitive Rolleiflex espionage camera.
Yep.
Yeah, look, he's taking pictures of us right now.
Oh, come on, man.
Just because he looks like a spy and acts like a spy, it doesn't mean he is a spy, does it?
I think it pretty much does, Sam.
Well, it certainly isn't unheard of for an individual to come under some sort of surveillance.
As soon as you get into a computer hundreds of organizations have information about every aspect of your personal life.
- Wow, really?
- Yes.
In fact, you could be bugged right now.
Well, now that you mention it, I am a little ticked, but I guess You don't suppose this guy's with, like, the ClA - or FBl or anything, do you?
- Could be.
Or he may be All right, I'll say it.
He may be with the KGB.
Come to think of it, this guy does kind of have a detective look about him.
All right, let's go over the four things we know about him: He's been here since we opened, he's not drinking, he's not waiting for a table upstairs.
Actually, that's only three.
Anybody else know anything?
You're an idiot.
That would be four then.
You know, if he's a detective, he's obviously after one of us.
If it was anyone else, he would've followed them right out the door.
We're the only ones who have been here the whole time he has.
Look, I got an idea.
I'm gonna go call him on the phone and distract him.
Cliff, you go see what he's been writing about us, and don't get caught.
Oh, no, don't worry about that.
Even if he does, he won't get anything out of me.
You don't know anything.
Cheers.
Yeah, who may--?
Who may I say is calling?
Excuse me, sir, phone for you.
- Who is it?
- They didn't say.
Take a number.
Five.
Oh, they hung up.
Probably call back.
Man.
He didn't even take a phone call.
This is getting weird.
All right.
Look, we gotta go to some private place and have a huddle.
All right, how about my office.
Sam, aren't you forgetting about your cologne?
Come on, would you?
It's had all day to wear off.
Okay.
We'll give it a few more minutes.
The ladies' room.
He's never gonna walk in on us there.
Don't you think that'll look a little weird?
Well, not if we go in one at a time so he doesn't notice.
Woody, cover the bar.
I think we could've spaced it out a little better.
Okay, if anybody here knows any reason why their personal conduct should be coming under investigation, I hope they have enough hormones to step forward and say so.
Okay.
Okay.
I'll bet it's Woody.
Come on, man.
That's crazy.
Why, Sam?
The fact that he's not here to defend himself makes him the perfect choice.
Well, yeah, there's that.
But, also Well, what do we know about Woody, huh?
I mean, he comes in here off the street out of nowhere.
Sam gives him a job.
No r√©sum√©, no nothing, huh?
For all we know, he could be in cahoots with that guy.
I say Woody's a plant.
Only from the neck up.
Come on, Cliff.
Think about it.
Woody?
I mean, you're a little off base here, pal.
- Oh, am l?
- Yeah.
Well, he just might've infiltrated the bar to keep tabs on you, Norm.
Me?
What for?
Oh, he's just saying you hypothetically.
- Well.
- Not really.
What's that supposed to mean, Cliff?
Think I'm some sort of crooked accountant, is that it?
No, no, no, Norm.
I'm just postulating the possibility there that the lRS might think your accounting's a little creative.
Oh, yeah?
Creative, huh?
I say the guy might be a postal investigator, Cliff.
You haven't bought a stamp since the Johnson administration.
And I'm talking about Andrew, pal.
Andrew Johnson.
Take that back right now.
I've been a postman for 1 1 years.
- Relax.
Take it easy.
- Oh, sure, relax.
From Mr Love-Them-and-Leave-Them here.
For all we know, he's sniffing out a paternity suit on you.
Oh, come on.
I think we might be getting a little carried away.
And this from the woman who toured Europe on her back.
That's it.
That's it!
The guy's upsetting my customers and my business.
I'm gonna go find out what he's doing.
Sam.
Sam.
Please.
I know.
I know.
You guys are trying to talk me out of making those charitable contributions, but somebody's gotta do it.
Hey, buddy Listen, what's your story here?
- You come in here and you-- - Sam.
He's a friend of mine.
- You know this guy?
- Yes.
Thank you, lrving.
You may leave now.
- Sure.
See you in class.
- Okay.
We went zooey over a guy named lrving?
He's a member of my psychology class.
He's assisting me in a little experiment about paranoia.
What do you mean, "experiment"?
Well, the idea was to introduce a foreign element into an established, secure environment in order to observe the ensuing behaviour.
I, for one, found it extremely interesting and highly educational.
Didn't all of you find it extremely interesting and highly educational?
Anybody?
Oh, come on.
Don't get mad.
It's silly to get mad.
Diane, we don't get mad.
Pardon me, Diane.
Excuse me, is there anything on my back, like a "kick me" sign?
- No.
- Thank you.
For several days I've been expecting the people here to get back at me for something I did.
I brought a man in Wait a minute.
Why are you so curious?
Just do your crossword and mind your own beeswax.
Oh, hey, Miss Chambers.
I stopped into the bakery on the way in to work and I got some muffins.
Would you like one?
Oh, here it is.
Muffins?
Yeah, blueberry or bran.
Which one do you want?
Which one do you want, Woody?
I'll take the blueberry, I think.
No, no.
I'll take the blueberry.
Okay.
Wait.
It's okay with you that I take the blueberry?
Then I want the bran.
Sure, Miss Chambers.
Enjoy it.
I just love the feel of warm muffins in the morning.
You a little nervous or something?
Me, nervous?
I'm not nervous.
I'm not a bit nervous.
I'm positively placid.
- Hello, everyone.
- Oh, Frasier.
Thank God you're here.
What took you so long?
I came as soon as I got your message.
- Well, I called your office hours ago.
- Well, I'd stepped out to Denver.
Well, if I'd known you were out of town I would never have expected you to come here.
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't be silly.
Listen, I was fed up with Denver anyway.
Breathtaking mountains, wide-open spaces, that hauntingly beautiful woman that kept coming onto me in the ski lodge.
Oh, good.
Well, as long as you're here, I wanna talk with you.
Woody, there's a little bit under that chair.
Diane, I've dreamed of this day.
Oh, Frasier.
I hope you didn't misinterpret my message as a wish to rekindle our romance.
No, of course not.
This is Tuesday, right?
When I said I dreamed of this day, I meant I dreamt of Tuesday.
Listen, I am very proud of the fact that I am completely over you.
Now, what is it?
Well, the other day I was conducting an experiment for my Behavioural Sciences Colloquium.
- I brought a man in.
- Man.
What man?
A classmate.
Oh, never mind.
The point is that I played this harmless trick on them, and now they're going to get back at me.
At first I approached it with my usual good humour, but now I find I'm obsessed.
I need your help.
Well, I think one or two sessions should clear it up.
Oh, Frasier, I don't want counselling.
I want you to spy on them.
Get close to them.
Find out what heinous revenge they have planned--!
Diane, look at yourself.
No wonder you're such easy fodder for their little pranks.
Look, the problem is you take everything so seriously.
Take it from me, who used to do the same thing, it's not worth it.
I'm much happier now that I let things bounce off of me.
Now that I'm happy-go-lucky Frasier Crane.
Frasier, you're right.
I do take things too seriously.
I need to lighten up a little.
Great.
Now that we've taken care of that, do you think there's any chance that you'll ever love me again before I lie mouldering in the grave?
Oh, I'm joking, of course.
It's just another example of my devil-may-care attitude.
Well, you've been a big help.
Thank you.
Diane, there's somebody here who wants to talk to you.
- Yes?
- Miss Chambers, I'm Martin Gallagher, WLBD, public broadcasting.
One of your professors at the university sent us some of your poetry.
And we thought you'd make a wonderful guest for our program, Boston's Working Poets.
- Really?
- Yes.
- You want me to appear on television?
- Yes.
- Well, I'm honoured.
- Well, you should be.
- lsn't that great?
- Oh, yes, it's really unbelievable.
Why don't you tell me a bit more about your show.
Well, the concept is part-time poets in their working habitat reading their own verse.
- Won't that be exciting?
- Why, yes.
Little old me on television.
My, my, my.
- Well, when do we get started?
- Well, would right now be all right?
Your Mr. Malone has kindly offered his poolroom.
Well, wasn't that nice of him?
I guess right now would be perfect, wouldn't it?
- Well, good.
- Let me show you where to set up.
So nice of you to drop by Cheers where I serve the public many beers.
This is it.
Are you sure?
I doubt if the collective intelligence of them could devise this complicated a ruse.
I'm absolutely sure.
They expect me to give a sensitive rendition of my poetry.
And then at some future date they'll play it back while they swill beer and throw spitwads at the screen and make unpleasant animal noises.
Well, I'm not going to fall for it.
- I have a little surprise for them.
- Now, that's the spirit.
Oh, Diane, what a couple we'd have made.
Two irrepressible zanies.
Wow, Miss Chambers, what kind of poetry are you gonna recite?
You too, Woody.
Oh, what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive.
Well, I hate to burst your bubble, but I've heard that before.
- We're ready for you, Miss Chambers.
- Yes, I'm sure you are.
- And I'm ready for you.
- Good.
You just stand over here.
Aren't you going to give me a clever introduction?
Oh, we'll dub that in later.
- Oh, why didn't I think of that?
- And roll camera.
As soon as you're ready, Miss Chambers, just begin.
Well, I would like to begin with one of my favourites, and I hope you'll like it too.
It's called "Ode to a Cornish Hen".
Sam, if you have an ounce of humanity, turn that off.
What did you think you were doing up there?
- I didn't think it was a real show.
- Are you kidding me?
I mean, who would make up something that boring?
Well, I thought you did.
I thought it was a joke.
I figured that you set it up to get back at me because of my psychology experiment.
What a great joke.
I wish we had thought of that.
I can't think of it now.
I made an absolute ass of myself.
Oh, come on, Diane.
Lighten up.
It wasn't that bad.
It really wasn't.
Heck, no.
I've known chickens who can't do that as well as you.
Hey, hey, come on.
It's no big deal.
Nobody watches that stuff.
It's not just the show.
After I filmed that thing, I felt kind of good thinking that you guys had gone to all that trouble to get back at me like you would with each other.
And I was thinking of myself as one of the gang, and now I don't know whether I'm more disappointed at that awful display on television or the fact that you still think of me as an outsider.
Oh, boy.
I'm sorry if I don't know what to say Go into my place, lie down.
Take as much time as you want.
- Feel better.
- Thank you, Sam.
I love you guys!
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
- Evening, everybody.
- Norm!
- What can I do for you, Mr Peterson?
- Elope with my wife.
What do you think, huh?
- Hey, Norm.
- Hey, Cliffie.
Pretend we're having a normal conversation, huh?
With you?
Party.
My house.
Saturday.
Twelve noon sharp.
You're invited.
- A party at noon?
- Keep it under your hat, will you?
You're the only one in the bar I invited.
I don't want to hurt anybody's feelings.
- Hurt mine.
- Norm, Norm, Norm.
Look, we're gonna have plenty of beer, cold cuts galore, a big bucket of slaw.
Oh, you're gonna love it.
And we're gonna maybe do a little painting.
- Painting?
- Well, just the attic.
That's not the point.
I'm inviting a lot of the guys from the post office.
- lt'll be a great time.
- I don't think so, Clifford.
- Hey, what's the problem here, Norm?
- You know I hate to paint.
- You know that.
- Yeah, so who doesn't?
But, hey, with all these guys around there, it'll take no time at all.
Oh, all right.
But don't tell Vera, all right?
She'd get upset.
I haven't finished painting our house yet.
Oh, how far have you gotten?
Oh, I bought the little hat.
I am so tired tonight.
I can't wait to get home and take a nice hot bath.
What?
Little Miss Popularity has a free evening?
Don't tell me you've been through all the men in Boston.
Oh, really, Frasier.
I heard you used to be a psychiatrist, Dr Crane.
Yes, I once belonged to that ridiculous profession where pompous intellectuals get together and discuss the illusion that there's something they can do to alter the human situation and deny that man is condemned to a life of bitterness and despair.
Yeah, but you got your weekends off.
I'm sorry, will you excuse me.
Poor Frasier.
Lost his job, and all he's got working for him is a drinking problem.
Well, you know, we ought to help Dr Crane.
I mean, we're his friends.
Somebody ought to give him a good talking to.
Don't you think I've done that?
You can't imagine how long and how hard I've talked.
Oh, yes, we can.
He's lost his self-esteem.
Without that, how can he hope to practice his profession?
You know what Frasier needs?
He needs to come out of the bullpen and get his first out.
You know, get his confidence back, his rhythm.
Sam, you're right.
If he could only cure someone.
Do we know someone with a problem?
Yeah, stumper.
Come on, doesn't anyone want to talk to Frasier?
- I mean, he's a trained psychiatrist.
- Hey, you're the one who had her brain overhauled.
Aren't you still under warranty or something?
If I talk to him in any personal way, he'll interpret it as a romantic overture.
Look, we don't even need someone with a real problem.
One of you could go to him with some symptoms, Iet him advise you, wait a while, then tell him you feel better.
I don't know, Diane.
I think it's a good plan.
- Well, thank you, Woody.
- It's quick, it's simple, and you don't have to send away for one of those kits or anything.
What kits?
You know, like the coyote does in the Road Runner cartoons.
By the way, now, I always wondered, if he can afford to buy those kits to catch the Road Runner, why can't he afford to buy something to eat?
Woody, I think you're missing the point here.
It's not that Wile E. Coyote wants to eat, necessarily, or that he wants to eat a roadrunner.
What he wants is to eat that particular roadrunner.
It's very existential.
We're trying to save a man's life here.
Yeah, Cliff, really.
Besides, I have to disagree with you, you know.
You never see the coyote eat anything else.
Think about it.
You never really see him eat anything at all, which could be why he's missing the damn bird all the time, you know.
The brain needs sugar.
Think about it.
You gotta clamp Yeah, yeah, yeah.
But did you guys ever see the one - where there were two roadrunners?
- Two roadrunners?
- Sam, Sam, Sam.
- What?
I think this plan will work, and you're the one that has to do it.
Me?
Oh, come on.
You can't expect me to pull something over on Frasier.
I don't know anything about psychology.
But you have no idea how simple this will be.
I'm talking about something as easy as, say, depression.
- Depression?
- Yes.
The symptoms are loss of appetite, inability to sleep, loss of sex drive.
Loss of sex drive, like in not wanting to have any sex?
Forget it.
No, no, no.
I don't like to lie about things like that.
Oh, Sam, why not?
Well, when I was a kid, I used to make goofy faces.
My mom used to say, "Don't do that.
It may stay that way".
I'm not doing anything goofy with my sex life.
No, I'm sorry.
Come on.
Sam, Sam, Sam.
Do this for me, and I'll owe you a big, big favour that doesn't involve sex, sex or sex.
- How about sex?
- Or sex.
Hey, Woody, pour me a beer, will you?
Thanks.
Sam, do it for Frasier, your friend.
Now, there's a head I can shrink.
- Say, Frasier.
- Yeah, Sam?
Can I talk to you for a minute in my office, please?
This won't take long.
Look, Sam, I know my bar bill's way up there, but I'm gonna be selling off part of my library, possibly some office furniture.
No, no, no, forget it.
I mean, I want you to pay your bar bill, but that's not what I want to talk about.
Frasier, I got a problem.
I'm depressed.
Oh, hey, who isn't?
Oh, well, no, no, no.
This is serious.
I think I need some professional help on this one.
I can't eat, can't sleep and I can't have sex.
- Those are the classic symptoms.
- Well, the sex part's not that bad.
I don't even know why I brought it up.
Well, what do you think has caused this problem?
The completely nonsexual one?
Well, I don't know.
I don't know.
What do you think it is?
You know, you're the only person I trust to listen to on this one.
Well, okay, Sam, I think I have some advice for you.
- Oh, good.
What?
- Well, get yourself a qualified therapist to help you get over your depression.
And when you do, give me his name.
No way can a coyote survive a gunpowder sandwich.
Well, I suppose that proves that the coyote's the Antichrist.
Come on.
Well, I can tell by the look on your face and Frasier's that it didn't go well.
Not only did it not work, but I had to tell another man that my equipment was on the fritz.
It was humiliating.
Well, I really appreciate that you gave it a try, Sam.
Thank you.
Oh, wait a minute.
You still owe me a favour here, don't you?
Oh, I suppose I do.
Do you have something in mind?
Yeah, let's go to bed.
Sam, have you forgotten my caveats?
Almost.
I was hoping to refresh my memory.
Good morning, one and all.
I feel delicious.
- Well, good morning, Frasier.
- Good morning.
- Coffee.
May l, Sam?
- Sure.
- Certainly.
- Listen, Diane, if you wouldn't mind, I'd like to have a word in private with Sam.
- Of course.
Help yourself.
- Thank you.
Sam, I had the most incredible evening.
Last night I dreamed about something not Diane.
Well, she was in the background chattering on about something.
Naked.
But the important thing is I was a therapist again.
And you were my patient, and we were discussing that problem.
- Problem?
What problem?
- You know, the one about your-- Jingle bells, jingle bells Jingle all the way Why don't we just go into my office and talk about it there.
- I'm sorry it's so messy.
- All right.
I got home last night, and I couldn't get your problem out of my mind.
- I think I've got a handle on it.
- Well, great.
Your whole problem stems from the fact that you're still in love with Diane.
You've been suppressing that emotion, denying it.
Well, what's your opinion about that?
Let me go find out.
I mean, let me think it out.
I think better out here, more light.
- I hope you're happy.
- Why?
What happened?
Frasier thinks I'm depressed because I'm in love with you.
Oh, dear.
I didn't see that coming.
Yeah.
I'm gonna go back in there and tell him the truth - before this gets even more ridiculous.
- Oh, Sam.
Didn't you see the bounce in that man's step?
The twinkle in his eye?
Let him think he made a good diagnosis.
What harm could it possibly do?
Oh, I don't know.
As long as you don't think I'm in love with you.
- Well, I don't.
- All right.
Not entirely.
At all.
Much.
Not a bit.
Mostly.
- Okay, you got it.
- Got what?
Oh, come on.
We don't have to rehash this over and over again.
- You said it, and I agree with it.
- But trust me.
Sam, say it.
Take a step toward feeling stronger and better.
Free yourself.
Sam, say it now.
Okay.
Okay.
- I love Diane.
- Oh, God, it's true.
Thank you, Sam.
You're welcome.
Are you all right?
I'm better than all right.
I'm reborn.
That revelation was just the catharsis I needed.
I've looked at the truth in its pure, undiluted form.
Now I can get on with my life.
Oh, well, great.
Hey, I feel better.
You feel better.
What could be better?
No, just a second, Sam.
You've only just begun.
- What do you mean?
- You've admitted that you love Diane.
To get rid of your depression, you'll have to admit it to her.
Sam, you must tell her that you love her.
Come on, man, don't make me say that.
Don't-- Come on.
- Well, why not?
- Because I don't-- - Because I don't want to.
- Come on, man.
Tell Diane you love her.
Let some fresh air and sunlight in there.
- Frasier?
- What, Sam?
I don't like guys touching my head.
Well, there's our next session.
I'm gonna run over to Louis and take a look at the new spring line.
See what I can do for the outer man, eh, Sam?
Yeah.
Yeah, good idea.
So this thing with Diane doesn't have - to take place right away?
- Oh, yes, it does.
Sam, it's very important.
You must tell her immediately.
I'll be back tomorrow, and you can fill me in on everything that transpires.
Every thought, every nuance, every detail.
- Every thought?
- Absolutely.
Oh, and, Sam, - this one's on the house.
- Oh, great.
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!
- What can I get you, Mr Peterson?
- Clifford Clavin's head.
Well, what are you upset with Mr Clavin about?
I spent the whole day yesterday at Cliff's house at a painting party, and I was the only one who showed up.
I painted all day while Cliff and his mother argued over who forgot to pick up the food and beer.
Did they at least thank you for your hard work?
Well, Woody, that depends if you consider "your friend sweats like a mule" a thank you.
No, that's really more like polite conversation.
Hey, what a party.
What a night.
Hey, Norm.
Tell me, did I make an ass out of myself, huh?
I'd bet on it.
Sam, calm down.
There's nothing to be excited about.
Tell Frasier you told me you loved me.
- Simple as that, huh?
- Certainly.
Well, for your information, he wants details.
Every thought, every moment.
Oh, dear, you're right.
Knowing Frasier, he'll want a complete account.
- Yeah, right.
- Well, it's still quite simple.
Tell him you said, "Diane, I love you".
I said, "How very sad for you".
- Then you said-- - No, no, no.
Whoa, whoa.
This was your stupid plan.
Now, if I have to be in love with you, then you have to be in love with me.
- Oh, all right, if it'll help Frasier.
- All right.
So I love you, and you're gaga over me.
"Gaga" makes it sound like I'm more in love with you than you are with me.
If we're going to do this, I want to be only as much in love with you as you are with me.
Okay, I love you, you love me.
Now the story.
Okay, we went out for Chinese, told each other you know what, and then we went back to my place and tore one off.
- Good lord.
- What?
Well, Frasier knows I would never be seduced by such a pedestrian approach.
Hey, who said anything about walking?
Fine.
Fine.
Let me hear your suggestion.
This ought to be good.
Oh, how about this?
Do you remember that romantic hideaway in Marblehead?
- The one with the fabulous seafood?
- Yeah.
Tell him we arrived at sunset.
The maitre d' - You better write this down.
- Oh, I like this.
All right.
Sunset.
- We asked for our table.
- Yeah, right by the big fireplace.
- With the ocean view.
- Okay.
Now, what did we eat?
He's not going to ask you what we ate.
We were too hungry to eat.
Oh, that's good.
That's good.
No, it's not good.
No, no, no.
You see, hungry usually means food.
- Now, what I'm doing here-- - No, I get it.
It's just not good.
Erase that.
All right.
All right.
Tell him you were so filled with passion that you pushed the plates aside and grabbed my hand.
"Filled with passion".
Then you say what you brought me up there to tell me.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
"l love you".
Well, Sam, I think you can enhance it a bit.
Like, "l love you, Diane.
I've always loved you, and I always will, till the day I die.
No, not even the grave will diminish my love.
Only Only make its flame burn brighter".
Whatever.
- Then, of course, it's my turn.
- Yeah, right.
What do you say to me?
I look you in the eyes and I say, "You're not so bad yourself".
No, no, no.
Come on.
After what I just said to you?
No, no, no.
It's gotta be more.
Something like, "l love you so much, I can't stand it.
As far as I'm concerned, you're the only person in the world that matters to me, and I'd jump at the chance to be your love slave".
Whatever.
All right, all right, all right.
Okay, so then we go upstairs.
If you insist.
We can leave the rest to Frasier's imagination.
We're already up there, I mean I mean, the room is paid for.
All right, all right.
I'll just build a fire.
- If you like.
- Yeah.
Then go over to the bed, and I'll start nibbling on your ear.
Yeah.
You always used to love that.
Oh, yeah.
- What do you mean, "Oh, yeah"?
- Oh, nothing.
No, no, no.
Come on, what do you mean?
Well, I don't suppose it would do any harm to tell you.
As long as we're on the subject, I never particularly cared for that.
The ear nibbles?
Well, you sure seemed to.
I didn't want to upset you, male pride and all that.
What else did you seem to enjoy?
Everything else was fine.
Just the ear nibbles were annoying.
I'm only bringing this up because there's no longer anything between us, - and we've grown so.
- Yeah, yeah.
Grown.
You know, while we're on the subject here, you remember that little yellow nightie you used to wear?
As I recall, I never wore it very long.
- You loved that nightie.
- No, no, you just thought I loved it.
- You didn't love it?
- It made you look like a big banana.
It's good that we can laugh like this, right?
I can't believe I paraded around in that damn nightgown thinking I was arousing you, and instead, I was amusing you.
It wasn't amusing that long.
I mean, after a while, it got kind of sad.
Why didn't you tell me?
Well, because I knew we'd get in a fight, and you'd end up saying that you hate me.
- Well, I do hate you, Sam.
- Well, I hate you, Diane.
You're incapable of any originality.
Now, you just said you hate me because I said I hate you.
All right, fine.
I'll change mine.
Yours was "l hate you".
Mine will be "l hate you"!
Oh, great.
And I just bought three ltalian suits.
- Oh, shut up, Frasier!
- Sam, what happened here?
Well, the same thing that always happens.
She's a nut.
She's certifiably insane.
Look, Sam, is that any way to talk to the woman you love?
Oh, come on, Frasier!
Let me fill you in here, pal.
I don't love Diane.
That was just part of her plan to make you feel better by making you think that you'd cured me.
- I see.
- I'm sorry.
Frasier, you were once a brilliant psychiatrist.
We couldn't bear standing by, seeing you throw it all away.
So this is what it's come to.
You were practicing deceit to get my confidence back.
You took pity on me.
You, of all people.
Two of the most pitiful people I know.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
She's a lot more pitiful than I am.
- Sam.
- You're both pitiful.
I'm pitiful.
We're, all three, a pitiful m√©nage √† boobs.
Well, this boob is moving on.
You two may not have the courage to face it, but I finally do.
Sam and Diane, you are now and have always been, hopelessly in, I guess the word for it is "love".
And unfortunately for you, like it or not, you always will be.
I know!
I know!
Now you're gonna deny it.
Even though it's ludicrously obvious to everyone around you, you two will go on pretending it's not true because you're emotional infants!
You're in a living hell.
You love each other and you hate each other.
And you hate yourselves for loving each other.
Well, my dear friends, I want no part of it.
It's time I just picked up my life where I left off.
It's time to put Humpty-Dumpty back together again.
So I'll get out of here now so you can just get on with your denial fest.
Well?
Well, what?
What do you think about what Frasier said?
Frasier's a pretty sharp guy.
Well, we agree on something.
What's next?
Well, if this is hell, I'm I'm not that unhappy.
Then we agree on something else.
Yeah.
Hey, I only said that That I didn't like your nightgown because you said that you didn't like my ear nibbles.
Well, I would've liked your ear nibbles if you hadn't sounded so much like a chipmunk.
Well, I'd rather sound like a chipmunk than look like a banana.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
Cheers.
Yes, ma'am, right away.
There's some lady screaming her head off.
What does she want?
I don't know.
All I could make out was "two-timing".
Sam, telephone.
Woody, listen up and learn something.
Sammy here.
Oh, hey, I thought you'd like those flowers.
Yeah.
No, no, that sounds like my note.
"Thanks for a wonderful evening, Barbara.
I had a great time".
Well, of course I know your name's Karen.
You know, hey, I see your mistake here.
You see, you didn't realise that, to me, Barbara means Karen.
Well, because.
Because Because "Barbara" reminds me of Barbra Streisand, and you know that song about people?
Well, I am getting to it.
You know the line, "First be a person who needs people"?
Well, who was the first person?
Yeah, all right, but the first female person was Eve.
And who's the most famous Eve of all, but Christmas Eve, right?
Yeah, well, what do you do on Christmas Eve, but you go carolling.
Right?
No, I know, your name's not Carolyn.
But after you go carolling, what you do is, you Karen the gifts.
Karen.
Yeah.
Well, apology accepted, sweetheart.
I'll talk to you later.
Hello, everybody.
- Hey.
- Clifford.
Well, Cliff Clavin is here to bid you all glad tidings and buy drinks for all my friends.
All right.
What's the occasion, Cliffie?
New air-cushion insoles or something?
No, no, no.
Better than that, Normie.
My branch office voted me Postman of the Year.
It's a very prestigious award too.
Only 267 given out in the greater Boston area.
- We're very proud of you.
- Yeah.
Will there be a ceremony?
Oh, of course.
Yeah, yeah.
As is traditional, to be held at the gala Postman's Ball.
Yeah, unfortunately it's not gonna be televised.
I hear it's blacked out in this area anyway, so But I understand the postmaster general is gonna make the toast.
Wow, a man of his position helping out in the kitchen.
Only in America.
Excuse me, Diane?
Can I have a word with you?
Of course.
"l, Cliff Clavin, would be ever so honoured if you, a lady of exquisite loveliness and taste, whom I hold in the highest respect and esteem, would accompany me with your presence at the gala Postman's Ball on the 1 8th of this month.
You would be doing this only as a friend.
There is no ulterior motive or strings attached.
Thank you for listening".
- Cliff, I'd love to.
- You would?
Yes, but I have something else planned that night.
It's all right.
You know, just asked on the spur of the moment.
I'm sorry, Cliff.
- No.
- I mean it.
I am.
- Oh, poor Cliff.
- Why?
What happened?
Well, he asked me to his Postman's Ball, and I had to tell him I already had plans for that evening.
What plans?
My cheese club meets that night.
So you're gonna eat cheese instead of helping Cliff out on this?
We don't only eat cheese.
We talk about eating cheese.
Come on.
Obviously, it means a lot to him.
All he wants to do is be seen with a classy-looking chick.
Oh, I don't know, Sam.
Look at all the people who've fallen hopelessly in love with me, with only the slightest encouragement.
- You, Frasier - Yourself.
- Well, perhaps I was being selfish.
- There you go.
- I'll talk to Cliff the first chance I get.
- Thank you.
Diane was crushed when she found she couldn't go to the ball with me.
Well, what are you gonna do now, Mr Clavin?
I'll just have to ask Carla.
Are you nuts?
Carla won't go with you.
She despises you.
Well, just because she despises me, doesn't mean she can't spend an evening dining and dancing with me.
Carlacould I ask you a favour?
What?
- Can we talk in the poolroom?
- No.
Carla, that wasn't the favour.
There's more?
What I have to endure.
Now for the kill.
Carla, "l, Cliff Clavin, would be ever so honoured if you, a lady of-- A lady would accompany me with your presence at the gala Postman's Ball on the 18th of this month.
You would be doing this only as a friend.
There is no ulterior motive or strings attached.
Thank you for listening".
Carla Carla Carla, this is really important to me.
I know.
But think of me.
All right, look, Carla, you don't have to dance with me and I'll buy you a dress.
- Nah.
- A corsage.
A hundred bucks.
- Nah.
- A VCR.
VCR?
Nice touch, but I'll have to pass.
Good Lord.
Is that a tear?
Look, I think my greed is overcoming your repulsiveness.
- I'll go.
- You'll go?
- Oh, Carla-- - First rule: No physical contact of any kind.
But, Carla, I'm so happy, I gotta hug something.
Okay, you can hug me for 5 bucks.
That's it.
My pleasure.
Well, got a date with Carla.
- Seriously?
- Are you kidding?
She fell for me like a sack of cannolis.
Yeah, you gotta love them, the little wenches.
Oh, Clifford, may I speak with you for a moment?
Yeah, certainly, Diane.
I've been thinking about it, and I've decided to break my engagement and join you in your evening of triumph.
- You'll go with me?
- I wouldn't miss it for the world.
Normie, Normie, did you hear that?
Diane will go to the ball with me.
- I'm taking Diane to the ball!
- Cliff, Cliff.
Think just a minute, now.
What's wrong with this picture?
Sam, change for a 20?
What are you talking about?
Oh, yeah, I forgot.
Well, I'll just have to have a huddle here with the man who knows almost as much about women as I do.
- Sammy?
- Yeah?
- A word, if you will.
- What's up?
Well, I seem to have one of those situations again.
You know, two dollies lined up for the same evening.
Oh, well, does this have to do with Diane, Carla and that postman thing?
- Yeah.
- Well, fair's fair.
Who said yes first?
Carla.
Well, you just have to tell Diane you can't go with her.
Make up some excuse.
Tell her that your girl cousin from Michigan is in town just for the day and that you gotta take her.
No, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
No, she's already heard that one.
Clifford, I've been thinking.
Oh, yeah, you can't go, huh, Diane?
Hey, I understand.
Honestly, you're so insecure.
I was going to say that I thought of the perfect dress to wear.
Sassy little strapless number, very graceful for dancing.
With my hair up and a hint of jewellery to catch the eye.
I'm going to make you very proud.
Now what, Sammy?
Yeah, this is a tough one.
Yeah, if Carla finds out you asked Diane first, you're gonna be dead before you hit the ground.
Hey, hold on a minute.
All you gotta do is, you gotta find Carla another date.
Someone better than you.
Hey, Sammy, Sammy, you are a genius.
Well, thank you.
Oh, yeah, listen.
When you talk to her about the guy, be vague.
Be general.
Don't get locked into anybody specific.
All right.
Vague.
General.
Carla?
How'd you like to go to the Postman's Ball with a guy who looks like Robert Redford and drives a Porsche?
Why aren't I going with you?
Well, see, there's this buddy of mine down at the P.O. You might have seen him in here.
He's been in a couple of times.
Well, son of a gun if he didn't say he's got a big crush on you, and, well, he wanted me to see if you'd go to the ball with him.
Now-- This isn't just some way of getting out of giving me the VCR, is it?
No!
No, no, no.
You'll get everything I promised.
Plus the bonus of not having to go out with you, which leads me to believe that this guy is a bigger loser than you are.
Just forget it, Clavin!
What kind of girl do you think I am?
One who would like a big-screen TV?
That's the kind.
Hello, everyone.
Good heavens.
- Miss Chambers, you look beautiful.
- Yeah.
- Thank you, Woody.
- Doesn't she?
Boy, you know, that just opens up the floodgates to a lot of memories.
Why, thank you, Sam, but I don't remember us ever going to a formal occasion while we were dating.
No, I was thinking about the girl I took to my high school prom.
Just kidding.
Just kidding.
Miss Chambers, can I tell you something?
Sure, Woody.
You look like a hundred bucks.
Thank you, Woody.
Oh, what am I saying?
Two hundred.
Woody, you're turning my head.
Okay, a hundred.
Oh, look out.
Here comes your boyfriend.
Everybody, I'd like you to meet Lucas.
Lucas, the gang.
Right.
He said hello.
You see, Lucas is sort of used to talking to himself.
Lucas, you wanna step on down to the bar and have something to drink?
- Oh, Diane, you look beautiful.
- Thank you.
Oh, this is for you.
Just a little token of my affection.
Thank you, Clifford.
If you don't mind my asking, who is this Lucas fellow, and why is he here?
Oh, well, we're gonna double with him and his date Carla.
Carla?
Well, I guess they're a match.
Although he does look like he's been around a mushroom or two.
Oh, Cliff.
Gee, this is big.
Big and beautiful.
Yeah, why don't you try it on.
Oh, no, no, something this big and beautiful should be preserved.
Oh, don't worry about that, Diane.
That's guaranteed to last through a 20-knot wind.
Sorry I'm late.
The baby spit up on my dress.
I had to buy a brooch big enough to cover it.
Real diamond chips.
Seventy-five bucks.
What is whitey doing here dressed like that?
Diane's the only date I could scrape up at the last minute.
Oh, yeah?
What are you paying her?
- Transistor radio.
- A cheap date.
I knew it.
Carla, don't you wanna meet your date?
I thought he was supposed to look like Robert Redford.
Well, he does from a distance.
Yeah, Mars.
And I think you'll soon find out just why a planet came to mind.
Carla, I'd like you to meet Lucas.
Lucas, your date, Carla.
What did he say?
I can't believe it matters.
Well, I can see this is gonna be a laugh a minute.
An evening with the stick, the nerd and door number three.
You kids have a great time.
Good night.
Jimmy!
Yo!
Well, you two seem to be getting on pretty well.
Yeah, well, I sure hate to have to admit this, Clavin, but tall, dark and gruesome here turned out to be a real groove.
Not a great dancer, though.
He mashed in the toes of my shoes.
I'll bill you for a new pair.
I don't believe this.
You should be buying me a VCR.
Just wait a minute.
You're not gonna welsh on our deal, are you?
Carla, come on, will you?
You're making out like a bandit here.
At least you're getting some loving tonight.
Boy, I made the wrong choice between you and Diane.
What did you say?
I said you and Diane look really choice tonight.
I see.
So where is the stick anyway?
She's just going to freshen up.
She'll be out in a couple of minutes.
You know, I never would have thought it.
You two.
What are you talking about?
Look, I shouldn't be telling you this, but when you two guys went to get some punch, Diane told me that she wished you'd come on a little stronger.
In fact, she said that she wished that you would do the one thing to her that no man has ever done.
I mean, not even Sammy.
- The one thing that makes her crazy.
- What?
What?
Just out of curiosity.
Run your fingers up and down her arm, Iook into her eyes and sing "Misty".
Sorry to hold you up.
Well, let's be on our way, Clifford.
Clifford, I want you to know that I liked your speech best.
Out of all 267.
- Really?
- Absolutely.
Listen, Diane, I want to thank you for keeping up the act tonight.
You know, staying by my side.
It wasn't entirely an act, Cliff.
I think tonight was the first time I saw you with your guard down.
You were yourself, not some mutation of Sam Malone, trying to impress people with tales of sexual exploits.
Women don't really like that, Cliff.
They want men to be sweet and vulnerable.
Then how come Sammy always scores?
Because he's gorgeous.
I mean, he has low standards.
He'll go out with any floozy who comes down the pike.
Speaking of pike, how come we're not on it?
Well, I wanted to take the long way home.
Yeah I just had the time of my life tonight, and I don't want it to end.
I just want to feel the night wind in my hair and share the company of you good people.
I think it's wonderful, Cliff.
Yeah, I think tonight was a real breakthrough for you.
Perhaps we've seen the end of the old insecure, arrested adolescent and we're seeing the emergence of the real Cliff Clavin.
- What?
- Darn.
- What?
What's wrong?
- We ran out of gas.
Well, the gauge reads half full.
Yeah, yeah, it always reads half full.
It's stuck there.
I guess in the excitement of the night, I just forgot to fill the tank.
Well, what are we going to do?
We're miles from a gas station.
Look at me I'm as helpless as a kitten in a tree And I'm clinging to a cloud I can't understand I get misty Just holding your hand Walk my way Get out.
- And a thousand vio-- - Now.
Yes, ma'am.
Diane, look, I'm sorry.
You don't understand.
I don't know what happened to me tonight.
The wine must have gone to my head, Diane.
Look, you know I hold you in the highest respect and esteem, and I would never, ever do anything to upset you.
Well, running out of gas?
Really!
- Well, we did run out of gas, Diane.
- Clifford.
Well, look, would a sign from God convince you?
Maybe.
All right.
Almighty God please, if I'm telling the truth about this car running out of gas tonight, Iet it start now, even on an empty tank.
Diane, hallelujah!
Oh, hallelujah!
Diane!
Oh, hey!
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
Good evening, you lucky dogs and doggettes.
Hey.
Hey, inside this airtight container is a taste sensation second to none.
Get your taste buds ready.
Ma's homemade pretzels.
You know, they kind of look like they were made in a home, Cliff.
Yeah, well, they're a little misshapen, you know?
Ma's arthritis made her hands stiffen up on her.
That explains the smell of mentholatum then, huh?
Yeah, here you go, Sam.
Chow down.
They're completely organic.
So, what word would you folks use to describe these babies?
- Filling.
- Okay.
All right, they're filling.
No, no.
I just lost one.
Yeah, well, you know, Norm, they're pretzels.
They're supposed to be hard.
Hey, look, I'm gonna go share a few with the guys in the back.
A little bit of salt and mustard on there and you really got something.
Yeah, a lawsuit.
I need some water.
I'm having trouble swallowing.
Why are you trying?
Well, I figure it's either that, or I have to take it out and look at it.
Everybody, I'd like you to meet my date, Dr. Lilith Sternin, M.D., Ph.D., Ed.D., APA.
Boy, it sure isn't spelled like it sounds.
I'm so proud of Frasier.
He's making good on his vow to start a new life.
Lilith and I met over drinks after the chemical-dependency seminar last week.
By the way, I noticed your drinking went beyond sociability.
Woody, may I have two cognacs?
And what would you like?
Come on, it was just a meaningless joke.
There's no such thing as a meaningless joke.
- I'd forgotten.
- I'll have a white wine.
I'll have a beer.
A beer, Woody, and white wine for the charming lady.
Charming?
Your flattery is obligatory and specious.
Thank you.
So how do you like Cheers?
Well, it seems adequate for its purpose.
But I have a feeling that you only brought me to this place to surround yourself with people you know and I don't.
Well, yes.
But what's more, I thought that we might have a drink or two, thereby lowering our inhibitions a bit, and enabling us to go back to your place, and have a physical encounter of some sort.
Well, we won't.
I appreciate your candour.
No, you don't.
You're right.
I feel like striking you.
Your attempt at machismo is totally inadequate.
You can't even make eye contact.
I could look at you if I wanted to.
But frankly, I've grown tired of counting the comb marks in your hair.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go and use the little boys' room.
Why does a grown man feel the need to euphemize?
Well, he did drink that beer awfully fast.
That's the hospital.
I'm on call.
With any luck, it will be one of my manic-depressives and the evening will take an upturn.
Well, you gotta love her, don't you?
Excuse me, miss?
Would you please inform Dr Crane that I had to leave on an emergency?
And kindly relay this message: "I've had a very uncomfortable evening, and I don't think we should see each other in the future, except professionally".
What?
No good-night kiss?
I kiss only as a prelude to passion.
Well, we've been warned.
Oh, dear.
It appears Frasier has been rejected again.
That poor yutz.
Even the trash only gets dumped once a week.
- Where's Lilith?
- Dr Sternin was called away on an emergency.
Well, that's all right.
Anyway, I didn't much care for Lilith.
Sam, do you mind if I just use your office for a moment?
Sure, sure.
How come?
I'm going to weep.
Poor Frasier.
I wish he could find someone to help him ease his loneliness.
Sam, couldn't you give him one of your hand-me-downs?
I already did.
No, I was thinking of someone who would be, like, fun.
Well, now that you mention it, I guess I could prescribe a little Candi Pearson for Dr Crane.
Candi.
I like Candi.
I sincerely doubt that Frasier would approve being set up for a one-night stand with one of your jiggling jugheads.
I am not talking about sex necessarily.
I just think that Frasier should know that women don't always mean misery.
I think Candi is just what the doctor prescribed.
She's cute, she's fun and she's never met a man she didn't like.
A lot.
- Hi, Sam.
- Hey, Candi.
Boy, is it good to see you.
You are beautiful as ever.
Sam, I'm getting a little low.
I'm also running out of beer.
Well, yeah.
Maybe I can help you out on both counts here, Frasier.
I'd like you to meet Candi.
- Hi.
- Hi, yourself.
Anyone ever tell you you've got a cute forehead?
Frankly, no, but I've been told I have acute anxiety.
What's your name?
Dr Frasier Crane.
I'm Candi.
Yes, so I see from your necklace.
Candi, with an l. Well, I used to spell it with a Y, but nobody ever took me seriously.
So then I switched it to an l. You know, like Gandhi?
Yes, yes.
I understand that's why he did it.
Could I buy you a drink?
Oh, sure.
- Something with bubbles.
- Very well.
Sam, champagne cocktails √† deux.
It looks like you and Candi are becoming friends.
Well, she seems like a very pleasant sort.
Sam, she's not here for you, is she?
No, no, no.
It looks to me like she's here for you, Frasier.
Well, yes, it does.
Well, you're lucky, doc.
You know, Sammy has never bothered to set me up with one of his bevy of babes.
Not that I need help.
No, just mercy.
Oh, I see.
This is all a set-up.
Well, I've seen that movie before.
When all else fails, hire some strumpet to date the town wretch.
Hey, this is not a set-up, and she's not a strumpet.
She's just here because I thought you might like each other.
No expectations, no frills.
You know, just kind of a casual thing.
Well, thanks, Sam, but no thanks.
Yeah, but I see your little attempt to corrupt Frasier has failed miserably.
I'm sorry, miss, but I just figured out what this is all about.
I'm not in the habit of fraternizing with women of your type.
What type is that?
You know.
Fun.
Good night.
I don't believe it.
Frasier just turned down Candi.
If it was me, I'd be making her scrambled eggs by now.
I'm sure she'd prefer that to sex.
Why do you open your mouth?
I didn't know she was there, Norm.
You know, we need to put a little bell on her.
I don't know what you think this is all about, but I just came here because Sam said you were a nice guy and you were down in the dumps.
And I thought maybe we could talk a little bit and have a couple of laughs.
Well, fine.
We've had that.
You've done your charity work for the evening.
Charity work?
You really are a sad case.
How a guy with such a great forehead could get so messed up.
Wait.
The least I can do is give you a ride home.
I'm going in your direction.
- Which direction?
- Out.
Thank you, Frasier.
You're sweet.
Say, you know, I just realized I'm feeling kind of hungry.
- Would you like to get some food?
- Oh, food.
My favourite.
Good Lord.
Frasier left with her?
Well, they have nothing in common.
What could he possibly have to say to that woman?
"Thank you, thank you, thank you".
Pretzels.
Fresh pretzels.
Get your fresh pretzels here.
Delivered to you piping hot from Ma Clavin's kitchen.
Come on, Norm.
You're his friend.
You promised you'd tell him to stop bringing that stuff in here.
All right.
I'll take care of it while I still have some teeth left.
Hey, incidentally, Normie, I don't mind telling you, you know, how much Ma appreciates the fact that you guys like her pretzels.
- Great, Cliff, listen-- - She's been down in the dumps these past 40 years.
You know, when she heard how you felt about these babies, well, she just broke right down and cried.
Oh, boy, pretzels.
Anyone seen Frasier yet?
No, not since he left last night with Candi.
Yeah, I wonder what they did, you know?
I'm sure they just went out and had dinner.
Yeah, I bet they had some dinner, all right.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
A real good dinner in a real fine restaurant, huh?
Actually, the best.
I wonder if the restaurant was crowded.
I sincerely doubt that Frasier took advantage of that young girl.
Come on, Diane.
Frasier's a guy, no different from the rest of us.
- Yeah.
- There's one difference.
He's scored since the invention of the wheel.
It doesn't have to be a big bell as long as we can hear it.
Trust me.
He might have taken pity on that poor girl and done something to be nice to her.
Frasier is far too sophisticated a man to be swept away by her transparent charms.
Greetings, one and all.
Say hello to Mrs Frasier Crane.
You're married?
Well, no.
No, we're not married.
And we won't be for a long time.
An hour.
Yeah, we're gonna tie the knot right here today where we met just 16 hours ago.
- That is, if it's okay with you, Sam.
- Yeah.
Sixteen hours isn't much time, Frasier.
Well, that depends on how you spend those 16 hours.
Hey, Woody, some champagne here.
I mean, this is quite an occasion.
I know I'm responsible for that, but I didn't even see that coming.
The thought never even crossed my mind.
Thoughts can't cross your mind, Sam.
The bridge is out.
Okay, well, I would like to propose a toast, then.
This is one that my father said at my wedding, and it's kind of always stuck with me.
"Thank God I'm not paying for this".
Thank you.
Thank you, all.
Spot.
Look at me.
I'm rumpled and loving it.
Sam, I'll never be able to thank you enough for introducing me to this precious flower.
That goes double for me.
Candi is the perfect girl for me.
I got so tired of thinking and dating at the same time.
But with Candi, I'm no longer "Frasier Crane, pompous intellectual".
I'm "Fras, pompous madcap".
And I kind of like him.
Come on, darling.
We'll just stop off at my place for a quick celebration, and then we've got a ring to buy before the justice of the peace arrives.
Oh, Fras?
Just a moment, dear.
What is it, Diane?
I hate what I'm about to say, and I pray to God it's not true, but I think you're doing this to draw me out, to force me to make a stand.
Please, tell me if I'm wrong, and I'll be forever silent.
- You're wrong.
- No, I'm not.
Yes, you are, Diane.
Okay.
Fine.
He's lost his mind.
Well, Cliffie, we got time for a wedding on this evening's agenda?
Yeah, yeah, well, if we put back the billiards game.
And we gotta miss the first ten minutes of nighttime Wheel of Fortune.
I hate it when someone throws a monkey wrench in the works.
No, don't worry, Norm.
Look, we'll just postpone the darts game until after the vows.
Yeah?
Aren't you forgetting something, Mr Organizer?
Today's the day when People magazine comes out.
- Yeah, so?
- So when are we supposed to black out celebrities' teeth?
Tell me that.
You know, you're not so dumb.
Thank you, Carla.
Frasier's not my cup of tea, but as husbands go, he could be all right.
He won't hurt you, and I think he'll always be faithful.
And if he isn't, who cares?
That's kind of beautiful.
Yeah.
Dr Crane?
I couldn't be happier for you.
- She is a beautiful girl.
- Thank you, Woody.
My dream is to someday fall in love with a beautiful girl, and for her to fall in love with me.
We get married and have three wonderful children who grow up, and move away from us, and hardly ever write.
She and I would grow old in an empty house together and die.
I forgot.
I also want a boat.
It'll happen for you, Woody.
I know it.
Shall we begin?
May we all gather down at this end?
My dear?
You look lovely.
You too, Frasier.
But you know what we're missing?
Music.
Music.
Of course.
Say, anybody play the piano?
I play a little.
Well, get up there, young man, and regale us with your virtuosity.
Woody?
Woody?
I don't think that's quite right for a wedding.
- It's perfect, senseless.
Madcap.
- Yeah.
Frasier would've hated it.
Fras thinks it's swell.
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to join this man and this woman in matrimony.
Marriage is a sacred union not to be entered into lightly.
If there is any person present who knows a reason why this couple should not be united, speak now, or forever hold your peace.
I do.
Right phrase, wrong wedding.
I have to stop this and stop it now.
There's something I must say.
I've tried to avoid it.
I've tried to hold my peace, but I can't.
It's urgent.
Please.
Sam, help.
Let's go, fast.
Listen up, everybody.
We'll be back in a minute here.
In the meantime, you'll be entertained by the magic fingers of Mr Woody Boyd.
Frasier, Candi, I apologize for interrupting what should be the most important moment in a person's life.
But I'm compelled to do this by my affection and respect for both of you.
Isn't it possible, that in the heat of recent events, you might be confusing physical attraction for deeper, more sublime emotions?
You know, in the psychiatric profession, we have a statement for that little theory of yours: Frasier.
You have to admit you and Candi are as different as night and day.
You are as different as Sam and l. Frasier, hear me out.
We were, as you are, diametrically opposed personalities.
At first, our differences were charming to us.
I found Sam's lack of refinement and sophistication crudely provocative.
Yeah, and I liked the way her hair smelled.
I'm sure, in addition, you were excited by the intellectual vistas to which I exposed you?
No, I really think it was that conditioner.
The point I'm trying to make is that the only thing we had - was a great physical relationship.
- Yeah, and we had a lot of that.
But when we'd go to concerts, Sam would be bored stiff, and I'd be excited, and we'd be on totally different planes.
Yeah, but we caught the same flight once we got home and hit the old Posturepedic.
Don't you see what you're doing here?
You feel guilty, at least subconsciously, for rejecting me, and that's causing you to act out.
For once in your life, Frasier, put away your flashcard psychoanalysis and face the truth.
How dare you insult my professional acumen!
Here's what I think-- Candi, please, you were not put on this earth to think.
Diane, you are without a doubt-- Oh, my God.
What have I done?
What have I said?
You said, "l wasn't put on this earth--" No, I know what I said.
I just can't believe I said it.
Candi?
I didn't mean it.
Please forgive me.
Yes, you did mean it, Frasier.
And what's more, you're right.
You know, I didn't understand anything anybody was saying except for Sam.
We can't get married, because I don't deserve you.
No, no, I don't deserve you.
I don't deserve to put polish on your toenails.
Although it was the highlight of breakfast.
Maybe we should spend more time together before we take this step.
You mean, like, the weekend?
That long?
Well, maybe.
I think you've made a very wise decision.
I think we'll be going now.
Listen, I'm-- I'm sorry I snapped at you that way.
It's the first time I've raised my voice to you in anger, and I promise it'll be the last.
That's too bad.
I thought you were kind of sexy when you were mad.
Really?
Well, don't just sit there.
Get a move on!
Sam, your office is a pigsty.
- See to it.
- Oh, Frasier.
And you know, if we can put a man on the moon, why can't we put metal in a microwave?
Diane, I gotta compliment you on the way you handled Frasier.
That was pretty good.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
Yeah, I hate to see a man and woman make a mistake.
- Frasier and Candi.
- Frasier and Candi.
Yeah.
Well, no, no, I mean, you gotta hang out with somebody for a long time.
You gotta really get to know them before you take a big step like that.
Yes.
If something's worthwhile, it's worth waiting for.
Absolutely.
Well.
A lot of people out there waiting for a wedding, and no bride, no groom.
Guess it's up to us, huh?
My God, Sam.
I can't believe my ears.
You're serious, aren't you?
Oh, no, no.
I just meant that we should go out there and serve those people some drinks.
That's all.
- That's what I meant too.
- No, it isn't.
What did you think I was talking about?
- Come on.
- Well, for a moment there, I confess, I thought you were talking about something else.
And what would your answer have been?
No, Sam.
That's the sort of question that has to be asked before it can be answered.
Well, if I heard the answer, maybe it would be easier for me to ask the question.
Very well.
The answer is no.
Well, the question was, "Have you ever met a man who gave you the hots more than me"?
I'd like to change my answer.
- Fine.
Go on.
- Then the answer is yes.
Well, then the question was, "Do you wanna go to bed with me"?
I wanna change my answer again.
Well, that's okay.
And I'll change my question to, "ls there any way that you would not object to not going to bed with me"?
Wait a minute.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
Mrs Tortelli?
Oh, you must be Vito Ragonzoni.
That's right.
The young man who wants to take out my little Anne Marie.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Soda, Sam.
Thanks for coming by, Vito.
Anne Marie told me that you wanted to take her to the movies, and I just wanted to meet you, get to know you a little better, you know.
Okay.
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
Well You certainly are a fine-looking young gentleman.
- No doubt about that.
- Thank you, ma'am.
What movie you taking Anne Marie to see?
- Oh, that's a Walt Disney, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.
Oh, one of my favourites, as I recall.
It is not only entertaining-- Turn to the left, please.
--it has a nice message.
Now to the right.
Thank you.
Ms Tortelli, I'm getting the feeling that you don't trust me too much.
Oh, gee, Vito, I'm sorry.
I guess I'm being a little overprotective.
You know, it's my little baby's first date.
But now that I see you, I see you're a fine upstanding gentleman, so here, tell you what.
Go on, get out of here.
Have some popcorn on me.
Have a good time.
Thanks, Mrs Tortelli.
Sam keep it in a safe place till the boys from the lab get here.
A hearty heigh-ho, everyone.
Hey, Frasier.
- What's with the bird there?
- Oh, do you like it?
I was doing some spring-cleaning the other day, and I came across old Plato here.
He was my father's pet.
Couldn't bear to part with him, not even in death, so he had him stuffed.
He's really got a lot of sentimental value for me.
He's an excellent example of taxidermy.
Quite valuable, I'm sure.
And I'd like you to have him.
Frasier, I don't think so.
- Well, then toss it.
- All right.
Oh, and, Diane, I came across these slides of our trip to Europe.
I didn't want to throw them away and didn't want them.
I thought perhaps you'd like them.
Oh, that's very thoughtful, Frasier.
I'd love to look at them.
Well, hey, I got a projector and a screen in the backroom there.
You said that projector was broken when I wanted to show my slides of Colombian art.
Well, yes, it is broken when you wanna show your slides of Colombian art.
I don't see any reason why we should show these slides here.
Well, why not?
I think those slides might benefit everyone.
It's a chance to see Europe's cultural and artistic highlights with an informed commentary by people who've been there.
Anyone who wants to see slides of Diane's and my trip to Europe, raise your hands.
You could make disgusting noises and shadow animals.
Fine.
I'll go set it up.
- Say, Cliff.
- Yeah?
Slides of the European trip, poolroom, five minutes.
Be there.
Hey.
Hey, yeah, great.
Wouldn't miss it.
There's a major yawn.
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!
- Norman.
- Hey, what's happening, Norm?
You know, it's a dog-eat-dog world, Sammy, and I'm wearing Milk-Bone underwear.
Yeah.
Vera has been phoning every 15 minutes here.
So, what's this for?
Well, I told her you'd call the second you got in.
- Well, you lied.
- All right.
Norman, maybe it's an emergency.
No, I know why she's calling.
You know the account-manager job I'm up for?
Well, it's between me and this one other guy, and today's the day they're making their decision.
Pins and needles time, huh?
Yeah.
Vera's really a mess, you know.
Except she's always had kind of a low threshold for excitement, you know.
Yeah.
You wouldn't believe the tizzy she went into the day she cracked open a double-yolked egg.
I made the mistake of telling Vera that if I get the promotion, we could buy a new house.
You know, so It's always been a dream of hers to have house with a bathroom so big, if you fall down, you won't hit your head on anything.
Well, now, that's smart.
That's smart.
Because, little-known fact, are caused by accidents in the home.
So were you.
Anyway, these guys, they're really giving us the full treatment.
- What?
- Yesterday, the executive wives invited Vera to a luncheon at a fancy French restaurant.
- Hey, hey.
- Experience really changed her.
She now refers to the Velveeta as fromage, thank you.
Well, you must be getting pretty excited about this yourself.
- Yeah.
- Not really.
- Come on, man.
Come on.
Come on.
- All right, all right, I'm psyched.
All right.
Norman.
If diligence, dedication and the old-fashioned puritan work ethic have anything to do with it, I'm sure Good luck, Norman.
Well, it's time I stopped avoiding the success that's been nipping at my heels all these years.
- My whole life stands before me.
- Right.
I'm poised here on the brink of destiny, guys.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Look out, world, get off my runway.
Ho!
Look out!
Hey, is everybody ready for the slide show?
Yeah, what the hell.
I got nothing better to do.
All right, everybody.
Filter on in here.
There's plenty of seats for everybody.
Yup, come along, now.
Come along.
Now, if everybody's passports are in order, we begin our sojourn in merry old England.
Yes.
Here's Diane at the Tower of London.
Where's the tower?
It's right there.
She's standing in front of it.
Yeah.
And here she is at the changing of the guard.
- Where are the guards?
- Well, if you look very closely, you can see them in the reflection of her sunglasses.
Which hide her eyes.
Which hide her emotions.
And here she is in front of Big Ben.
That wall looks just like the other wall.
But imagine that at the top of this wall there's a clock.
Do you actually ever take pictures of things where you could see the things themselves?
- Well, I'm sure I must have.
- Well Scenery at last.
Now, this is Diane boating on the Seine.
- Oh, yeah.
- You know, I think that was my last carefree day on the Continent.
But I digress.
Yeah.
Here she is pretending to enjoy herself in front of Notre Dame.
I was enjoying myself.
Of course you were.
I didn't mean to imply anything else.
And on to sunny ltaly.
Boy, she doesn't look happy there, does she?
- No.
- How could she?
She was much too preoccupied with thoughts of desertion.
- Frasier.
- I'm sorry.
Ignore that.
Ah, yes, beautiful Florence.
She looks just like Miss Chambers.
It is Diane, Woody.
I think this is the night I proposed to her.
Yes.
You see, she's laughing at me.
I am not laughing at you.
I'm smiling for the camera.
Of course you were.
You're about to rip out my heart.
Yes.
Yes, here she is plotting her betrayal in front of the Ponte Vecchio.
How appropriate, in the country of Lucrezia Borgia.
- Frasier, you're incorrigible.
- Oh, Diane, wait.
No, wait.
Hey, let her-- Well, that was a thrill a minute, huh, Norm?
I'd say your Florida slides were better than that, Cliffie.
Oh, I got them in the trunk of my car.
It's a good place for them.
I'm sorry.
I am so sorry.
I thought I was getting better.
Frasier, sit down.
You keep saying you're getting better, but I haven't seen any evidence of it.
Now, hard as it may be, you've got to stop being preoccupied with me.
- Get a hold of yourself.
- Enough said.
You don't have to hit Frasier Crane over the head.
Unless, of course, you'd like to.
Where is your sense of humour?
Frasier, here.
Listen, been a long time since I went out and raised a little hell.
What do you say you and I go out and get crazy?
You know, a couple of guys giving the women of Boston their best shot?
- Well, this is a pity offer, isn't it?
- Basically.
Okay.
Might be just what the doctor ordered.
Rattle my cage a little.
All right, that's the ticket.
Listen, I got a few things to do for a while, so why don't you just sit down here and be a good little boy, and Sammy Claus will take you out later and get your tree trimmed.
- Hey, Norm.
- Jeff.
What are you doing here?
I just wanna have a beer with the new accounts manager.
- Did I get the job?
- I haven't heard anything definite, but if I had an extra dollar to wager, I'd bet it on Norm Peterson.
Since I don't, could you buy me a beer?
All right.
Woody, two beers.
- Come on.
Have a seat.
- Great, great.
I just wanted to come down and wish you good luck.
There's a lot of scuttlebutt around the water cooler that you and Morrison are neck and neck.
But there's a lot of us down in the trenches who are pulling for you.
Thanks.
That means a lot coming from your peers.
I just hope when you're up in the executive suite and I'm down in steerage we can still be friends.
Of course.
Were we before?
"Were we before"?
Oh, God, that's great.
Oh, I tell you, it's gonna be so great to have somebody up there with a sense of humour.
That's terrific.
And by the way, that was a brilliant job you did on the Stallings audit.
I mean, who else would've figured out how to write off Mrs Stallings' - breast reduction as a depreciation?
- Yeah.
You know, I hear that Stallings will be eligible for parole in our lifetime.
Does anyone have more fun than bookkeepers?
Oh, face it, Norm, you deserve to win.
You're more experienced, you're a nicer guy, and you got some professional ethics, unlike Morrison.
What are you talking about?
Are you kidding?
You don't know about Morrison and the boss's wife?
They've been making it every Tuesday night for the past five months.
- Jeffrey, I can't believe that.
- No, I'm serious.
Once a week?
Well, I guess if you're young, you can handle that kind of schedule.
I better shove off.
- Mrs Reinhardt?
- Mrs Reinhardt.
- Hey, Norm?
- Yeah.
Would you promise me one thing?
When you get the promotion and it's time to hire an assistant, you'll remember my name?
- Sure.
Yeah.
What's that last name?
- You big lug, you.
That's Warren, with two R's.
W-A-R-R-E-N.
Well Woody, a little champagne, please.
Sammy, some cigars for all my friends.
On the new accounts manager.
No kidding, Norm?
You got the job?
No, not yet, but just learned a little bit of information about my competition that ought to clinch it when I accidentally let it slip.
All right, Norm.
- Hey, Norm?
- Yeah.
Norm, I might have spoken out of turn about Morrison and Mrs Reinhardt.
You wouldn't let it go any further, would you?
Jeffrey, I'm insulted, man.
So as I was about to say, Jeff here lets it slip that my competition's making the sheets sing with the boss's wife.
Oh, yeah, that's pretty hot information there, isn't it?
You're gonna rat on him?
No, I'm gonna sing "Moon River" outside their motel room.
I know you want this job pretty bad.
You think that's the way to go about it?
I have to agree, Norman.
This just isn't you talking.
You're not the ruthless, cutthroat, aggressive type.
I don't know where you guys got the idea that I'm just some passive, easygoing lump.
Norm, if your buns didn't fall asleep, you'd never get off the bar stool.
They're wide awake now, guys, and I want this promotion.
I want it for Vera.
She deserves it.
Norman, think for a moment what you're about to do.
This could even backfire on you.
You don't even know if this terrible rumour is true.
Well, I have a pretty good idea it might be.
Mrs Reinhardt came on to me at the Christmas party.
What did she say?
"Move it.
You're standing in front of the cheese dip".
But she said it with bedroom eyes.
I'm telling you, this is a mistake.
You guys all think that this is a bad idea for me to use this information?
Of course we do.
Not everybody.
You know, Norm, this Morrison is an adulterer and shouldn't be allowed to prosper by it.
Now, if we let this type of un-American activity go unchecked, before you know it, our leaders will be in chains, our women will be learning how to shot put, and all we vital American males will be force-fed borscht along with generous helpings of Das Kapital.
That's not those fish eggs, is it?
No, but it smells as bad.
Well, then you tell them Woody Boyd says nyet.
Attaboy, Woody.
Norman, a snitch is the lowest thing on this earth.
You know it.
Little kids know it.
Old ladies know it.
Dirty, rotten-toothed prisoners in dark, wet cells know it.
Norman, if you tell on this guy, and your friends find out about it, - they are gonna hate your guts.
- How are they gonna know?
I'll squeal like a stuck pig.
Norm, come on.
You can't do this.
All right.
You're right, you're right.
Guys don't tell on other guys.
It's just not right.
I can't do it.
Hey, Frasier, I'm ready if you are.
Oh, wonderful.
Let's begin our evening of revelry.
All right.
Now, listen.
I wanna get one thing straight: Tonight, I don't wanna hear one word about Diane Chambers.
Okay?
We're gonna get out there and get your mind on more pleasant things.
Agreed.
Where are we going?
Well, I think the first thing we need is some female companionship.
I know a couple of the hot spots, so why don't we just mosey along here.
Let me tell you how this evening's gonna go here.
Now, we're gonna probably walk into some really nice little spot there.
You're gonna see a beautiful woman across the room.
I mean hot, sexy.
A woman you dream about.
All right, now, her friend is for you.
Got it?
Good Lord.
That's my boss, Mr Reinhardt.
That's the poor sap, huh?
Cliffie, quick, breath test.
What do you smell when I do this?
Milwaukee.
Mr Reinhardt.
Hi, sir, how are you do--?
Coincidence that you caught me in here.
I was just using the washroom.
- What do you say we?
- At ease, Peterson.
We know you spend a lot of time here.
This is where we send your checks.
That's very good.
That's good, sir.
That's good.
Well, have a seat.
So to what do I owe this pleasure?
Well, I wanted to come and tell you in person.
It's not the easiest thing I've ever had to say, but you didn't get the job.
I appreciate your coming here to tell me that, sir.
It was a tossup between you and Morrison right up to the end.
I have to tell you, in virtually every way, you match up perfectly.
You both exemplify the high standards we expect from our employees.
In fact, we can't find a black mark against either one of you.
Your behaviour and Morrison's, in and out of the office, is impeccable.
If there were-- If there were just one thing, one tiny thing to tip the scale in your favour, I'd go to bat for you.
Sir, I think I ought to tell you something.
This is terribly personal, and it could really be painful for you.
Probably gonna change your life in every way but before I get into it, would you like a cheese doodle?
I have a craving for Could I have some cheese doodles, please?
- No, Norman.
- Yeah, yes, Norm.
Yes, yes.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- Yes, yes, do it, do it.
Yes, yes, yes.
Who are those people, Peterson, and why doesn't one of them want you to have a cheese doodle?
She's actually-- She's trying to help me watch my dairy intake, sir.
Well, what was the terribly personal thing you were gonna tell me - that's gonna change my life?
- Oh, that.
It was-- That was nothing.
You had something in between your teeth.
Do you have a--?
No, no, no.
It's-- I guess, you know, it's gone now.
That combination of syllables in your last sentence - must have just kicked it right out, sir.
- I see.
- Well, I'd best be going.
- Sir.
There's something you're not telling me here.
I mean, why didn't I get this job?
Oh, I suppose I owe you the truth, Peterson.
Well, yeah, you do.
It's your wife.
What does my wife have to do with this?
Well, she didn't fit in with the other company wives.
That's-- Vera's a wonderful woman.
What are you talking--?
Well, yes, I'm sure in her own circle she is, but that lunch the other wives took her to yesterday was sort of a test.
A spouse has to be able to mix easily with other people in the company.
That's just great.
Well, that's great.
Sir, tell you what.
If my wife isn't good enough for this company, neither am l. Oh, I'm sorry you feel that way, Peterson.
But I understand.
And I admire you for your loyalty to her.
Now, wait a minute.
Morrison's wife is somehow more acceptable than mine?
No.
As a matter of fact, Morrison's never had a wife.
Oh, yeah, well, I wouldn't be too sure about that one, sir.
- Good luck.
- All right, fine.
I'm so sorry, Norman.
Thanks.
That was the easy part.
Now I have to break the news to Vera.
What are you gonna tell her?
The truth, I guess.
When she went to lunch with the other wives, she didn't pass muster.
Well, maybe she couldn't reach it.
Hi, Vera.
Listen, honey, no point beating around the bush here.
I didn't get the promotion.
In fact, I just got so mad at the guy, I just went ahead and quit.
Yeah.
Yes.
Yes, they did, they gave me a reason, hon.
They said that well, what they said was, I'm just not the right man for the job, you know.
You just face it, honey, I'm a loser.
I don't know why you just don't go just pack up your bags and leave me.
Hello?
That's very funny.
That's cute.
Listen, sweetie.
There's something I have to tell you.
Even on a terrible day like today, I feel like I'm the luckiest man in the world, because I married you.
I don't know.
I've had two, three, maybe.
I'll talk to you later.
Yeah.
- Norman?
- Yeah.
That's one of the finest things I have ever seen a man do.
Yes.
How great, I'm unemployed.
Don't worry, Mr Peterson.
Something else will come along.
No, no, I mean, great, I'm unemployed.
Give me a beer here.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
It was your fault we lost that contest.
- It was not my fault.
- We'll find out whose fault it was.
- "Heart of My Heart" from the top.
- All right, sing it.
Heart of my heart - I love that melody - Love that melody Heart of my heart Brings back Right there!
That's the note that cost us the championship.
Oh, yeah?
Well, that remark just cost you a bass!
Hey, wait a minute, Jim.
Now we gotta find ourselves another bass.
Three beers.
You know, I love barbershop quartets.
You mind if I make a little request?
Not at all.
Could you give me a little trim around the ears later?
Excuse me, fellas.
I couldn't help overhearing what happened.
It's always been a lifelong dream of mine to sing in a barbershop quartet.
I wonder if you might give me a try?
Why not?
"Good Night, Ladies" okay?
Yeah "Good Night, Ladies".
All right.
All right.
Good night, ladies Good night, ladies Good night, ladies We're going to leave you now - That was fantastic!
- Hey, we got ourselves a new bass!
Yeah, well, no.
You know, I'm really flattered, fellas, but I don't think so.
You said it was your lifelong dream to sing in a barbershop quartet.
Well, it was and now I've done it.
Thanks for the memories.
The farmer in the dell The farmer in the dell Hey, everybody, howdy-doody.
- Guess what I got in the bag.
- What's left of your mind?
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to introduce a turnip that needs no introduction: Miss June Lockhart.
Hey, look here.
You put a little makeup on her.
Shampoo and set her root hairs.
Finish her off with a delicate strand of pearls Is it me or is this getting a little weird?
You passed weird six months ago.
Now you're boldly going where no man has gone before.
Boy, I guess it's true what they say, huh?
It's a fine line between gardening and madness.
Cliff, old man maybe a little vacation would do you some good.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I gotta get back to my office.
Hey, doc?
Doc, listen, you mind if I tag along with you?
Just for the stroll, you know, a little informal chat on the way?
You bet, Cliff.
I'd enjoy the company.
Well, yeah, good.
Listen, I'm a very private man.
I've gotta warn you at the outset.
I just don't bare my soul at the drop of a hat.
Oh, I understand.
Yeah, I was breast-fed a lot longer than most youngsters.
I mean, babies.
Hey, everybody.
Oh, hey, Sam.
I thought you weren't coming in till 5.
Oh, well, I had to pick up some stuff.
We're gonna play some racquetball.
Oh, Bonnie, Woody.
Woody, Bonnie.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Are you all right?
So where you guys been?
Oh, we spent the afternoon at Bonnie's apartment listening to the latest album of John Cougar Mellensomething.
- Mellencamp.
Yeah, he's great.
- Yeah, you're telling me.
So, what rock groups you like, Bonnie?
Let's see.
I like the Thompson Twins, Tears for Fears, U2.
- Oh, I love U2.
- Yeah.
Yeah, we look great together, don't we?
Hey, I'll be right back.
I'm gonna get my equipment.
- Pretty girl, Sam.
- Yeah.
Thank you.
Be careful she doesn't lose a baby tooth giving you a hickey.
What's that crack supposed to mean?
She young or something?
Well, you must admit, there's a bit of a gap between your ages.
Oh, yeah?
She's a very sophisticated woman, and she has travelled extensively.
She's been to Hawaii.
Boy, I envy Sammy - his carefree lifestyle.
- Yeah.
Night after night, he dates pretty girls, while I sit here and wrestle with the world's problems.
You do not.
What do you mean?
Last night, I let out that moan at the thought of nuclear war.
It wasn't because of nuclear war.
It was because we ran out of beer nuts.
It was a combination of the two.
- Y'all set?
- Oh, yeah.
You know, Sam, Woody's a really rad guy.
Well, you know my motto: "Hire the rad".
Wait a second, here, let me get some money.
I'll be right back.
Hey, have a good game.
Thanks, Woody.
I'll see you Saturday?
Saturday?
What's happening Saturday?
Oh, Saturday, Woody and l, we're gonna play racquetball.
I didn't know you played racquetball.
Yeah, I play a little.
Why didn't you tell me?
Well, I didn't think the two of us should play.
Well, why not?
Oh, come on, man, just because I'm a professional athlete?
No, it wasn't that.
It was more because you're a little I mean, you're a few years Yeah, it's because you're a professional athlete.
No, it wasn't.
It's because you think I was old, maybe.
Oh, no, no, not old, Sam.
Just older.
You wanna take me on, you little guy, you?
Sure, I'd like that.
All right.
Carla, you wanna tend the bar here?
Got it.
Sam, has it occurred to you that you challenged Woody to a contest because he threatened your relationship with Bonnie?
No.
But has this occurred to you: Leave me alone.
You all set, man?
- Sure am.
- Great.
Great.
Oh, hey, is that somebody famous up?
Oh, I guess not.
I'm sorry.
My mistake.
Okay, we're off here, huh?
You're not too tired to work behind the bar now, are you, Woody?
- I can take over if you are.
- No, I'm fine.
Sam, are you limping?
I don't know.
Let me take a look here.
Oh, by golly, look at that.
It must be these new shoes.
- Who won?
- Sam did.
Yeah.
You should have seen him out there.
He was great!
You know, I especially liked that last shot you made diving across the court.
And that little scream you let out?
Oh, that's my victory scream.
I always do that when I win.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, why?
Your upper lip is sweating profusely.
I just played racquetball.
People sweat when they do that.
On their lips?
Didn't you take a shower afterwards?
Of course I did.
Maybe I just forgot to dry my lip.
Does Sam's behaviour give you pause?
Methinks the man does protest too much.
Excuse me, Miss Chambers, but shouldn't it be "l thinks"?
Not in your case, Woody.
What's with the skis, Sam?
Oh, all this physical activity's put me in a physical mood.
I feel like doing something else physical.
I think I'm gonna go skiing for a while.
If you need help behind the bar, Woody, call Bob.
Sam, this is all rather sudden.
Where are you going?
How long will you be gone?
Sugarloaf, Maine.
If the snow's cold and the women hot, I'll be gone forever.
See you guys.
Bye-bye.
What a guy!
We just get through playing a hard game of racquetball and he's still raring to go.
You just never know what he's gonna do next.
Like now, for example.
Are you absolutely sure?
Thank you.
Oh, dear me, my worst fears are confirmed.
There's been a peroxide embargo?
This is no time for levity.
I just called every hotel in Sugarloaf, and there's no Sam Malone registered anywhere.
Maybe he's staying under an assumed name.
No, I checked all the assumed names he usually uses.
There's no Lance Manion.
Nor is there a Honeyboy Wilson.
Hi, everybody.
Hey, doc, I really gotta hand it to you for that job you did on Cliffie.
He's really been in good spirits lately and rarely discusses vegetables.
Yeah, it seems our little impromptu session's been quite beneficial.
You know, for my part, I hope to get an article published in either Psychology Today or the Burpee Seed Catalogue.
No, seriously, it's always very gratifying to help another human being.
Hey, Sigmund Fraud.
Are you addressing me, Cliff?
This bill is outrageous, I've had several of Ma's organs taken out for less than that.
It was not a little chat.
It was seven hours of intensive psychotherapy, which I flatter myself to say has done you a world of good.
Oh, yeah?
You think so?
Yeah, well, I don't think so.
And neither does Meryl Streep!
- Are you ladies ready for a check?
- Yes, thank you.
Anyway, I've been at Boston Mercy for five years, and I have never had a more relentless patient than I had today.
Even when he was in constant pain, he never stopped coming on to me.
My God, it's Sam!
Are you all right?
The patient you're talking about.
Is it by any chance Sam Malone?
- No.
- Thank God.
His name is Lance Manion.
Oh, yeah, thank you.
Certainly.
Is there anything else I can get?
Yeah.
Naked.
Actually, I don't think I could handle it today.
Boy, these hernias always hurt so bad?
Oh, just for a few days.
Well, if you need anything else, just ring.
Thank you.
Oh, God Sam?
Hey, boy, what a coincidence!
Just donated a pint of blood.
The volunteer will be back.
Just have a seat here and Hey, bless your heart for giving, really I know why you're here.
As luck would have it, a couple of nurses stopped by the bar.
They had your fingerprints all over them.
I see.
In that case, you don't mind if I sit down, do you?
From this angle, it's preferable.
Sam, I know what this is all about.
Dating young girls.
Nearly killing yourself to beat Woody.
Not telling us you were in the hospital.
No, I didn't tell you I was in the hospital because I got a hernia, and it's an old man's problem, and I didn't want the guys to make fun of me.
That's all.
First of all people of all ages get hernias.
Second of all getting older is the most natural thing in the world.
There's nothing to fear.
Accept it.
I will not accept it!
Listen, the day you start accepting getting old is the day you get old.
- All right, Sam.
Have it your way.
- Yeah.
But I think you'd be much happier and content if instead of fighting the advancing years, you embrace them joyfully.
No.
Hi, how you doing today?
- Great, as a matter of fact.
Thank you.
- Well, I'm glad to hear that.
- Diane?
- Oh, yeah.
Diane Chambers?
Yes, that's right.
Don't you remember me?
Steve McDunna.
You tutored me for a while when I was in junior high.
Stevie McDunna?
Little Stevie?
Little Dr Steve Big little Dr Stevie?
Yes, yeah.
It's very nice to see you again.
I'm sorry, I have to run.
I'll check in with you later.
Yeah, bye-bye.
I'm old and alone in Boston.
Sammy's back!
Sam, what are you doing back here?
You should be in for at least another week.
Dr Stevie said so.
I got me a second opinion.
My own.
I'm as healthy as an ox.
Hey, good to have you back, Sammy, my man!
- Can't keep a good man down, huh?
- Yeah, no, it's good to be back.
Now don't encourage him.
He's rushing things.
- Good to have you back, Sammy.
- Yeah, thank you very much.
Carla, could you cover the bar a second?
I'm just gonna grab a case of Bass Ale.
Oh, hey, hold on there, young fella.
I'll get that.
I'll get that.
Don't be stupid, Sammy.
You just had an operation.
Hey, the day that I can't pick up a case of beer is the day that I sell this place.
Sam, what are you trying to prove?
I'm not trying to prove anything.
I'm just trying to run a bar here.
Not too shabby, huh?
- Nice going, Sammy.
- Yeah.
Sam?
Do you wanna go back to the hospital?
Very badly.
No, I can do it.
I can do it.
Welcome back, Valentino.
Hey, that's the first time you didn't accidentally check the starch in my whites.
Oh, yeah, about that, I'm sorry if I got fresh.
Don't apologize.
We nurses didn't cut the ties off the back of your gown for nothing.
Company's coming!
I'm sorry, Sam, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to do this.
I know you didn't.
That's all right.
It's okay.
He's been like this ever since you left, Sam.
Sam, l I've come to donate an organ or something.
Woody, Woody, I have a hernia.
Well, if you need another one, take mine.
Well, thank you.
Thank you, man.
Hey, thanks for coming down.
I really appreciate that.
You You're depressing the hell out of me.
It may be better if you took off.
Yeah?
You got it, Sam.
- I'll see you.
- All right.
Bye-bye.
Here you go, Sam.
I want you to have that.
It's kind of a family heirloom.
- What is it?
- A truss.
It came over with my grandfather from the old country.
Actually, it came over on my grandfather.
Oh, well, yeah, gee, that's nice.
Thank you.
It's a joke!
You don't need this thing.
You're Sammy.
Sammy don't wear no truss.
Geez!
Oh, that's funny.
That's very funny.
Yeah, well, don't pop your stitches laughing.
I'm sorry.
It's just this stupid hernia thing's getting me feeling my age.
What are you talking about?
Would you stop that?
Sam Malone never ages.
It's one of life's great truths.
Let me tell you something, Sammy.
When you're 87, you'll still be a hunk to me.
Of course, I'll be senile and blind.
- And pregnant.
- Yeah, probably.
- I'll look you up.
- You better.
Fun's over.
See you around, Sam.
Thank you, Carla.
Bye, Carla.
You see?
There are other parts to a hospital besides the maternity ward.
Bite it.
Hi, Sam.
How are you?
I don't even know why you bother asking.
You know how I am.
I'm old.
- Sam, please.
- No, no, no, you were right.
You know, I tried denying it, but it's no use.
All I got to look forward to is slowing down, wearing out, and breaking the occasional hip.
Oh, Sam!
Oh, I can't stand to hear you talk like that.
You were right.
I was wrong.
You can't just lie back and accept getting old.
You have to live each day to the fullest.
I don't know.
It's No, really, I mean it.
Besides, you men get better looking the older that you get.
Look at this guy.
Huh?
Strong.
Vital.
Sexy.
Isn't he something?
You really think I'm better looking now?
You're a much more attractive man than when I first met you.
Much more.
And there's no telling what you may yet achieve.
I went to the library today, and I found a book that contains a list of people who made contributions well into their latter years.
Listen to this: Leo Tolstoy, Albert Schweitzer, Grandma Moses, Bertrand Russell, Picasso, Goethe - Oh, now, he's my favourite.
- Yeah, mine too.
Mine too.
He What are you doing?
Well, I just thought I'd make the room look a little more romantic.
You keep reading.
You go right ahead.
Oh, Sam, this is wonderful.
An old person wouldn't be doing this.
This is the act of a vital, strong, young man.
Who wants a woman.
Who wants sex.
Who won't get it.
But this is a very positive sign.
Ah, hey, come on, you know.
This is a chance of a lifetime to play doctor in a real hospital.
Now come on.
It's tempting, it's tempting, but I think not.
I'm going to go now and let you rest.
Yeah.
Hey, listen.
I don't want you to make too big a deal out of this, but thank you very much for coming.
Your visit helped a lot today.
Well, if we can't reach out in our moment of need, if we can't span the gap that separates each human.
If we can't allow Sweetheart, sweetheart, that's what I meant by making too big a deal.
- Okay.
Goodbye, Sam.
- Bye-bye.
Hi.
- Howdy.
- Hi.
Thanks, I can handle it.
- I'm Jack Turner, your new roomie.
- Sam Malone.
How you doing?
Great.
Hey, Sam Malone.
You're the baseball player, aren't you?
Yeah, yeah, that's me.
Yeah, so what are you in for?
Hernia.
- No kidding?
- Yeah.
Yeah, I had one of those a couple of years ago.
- Didn't slow me down a bit.
- Yeah?
Is that right?
Really?
Well, you and I are about the same age, aren't we?
Yeah, sure.
Well, what are you back here for?
Bone spur.
Yeah.
Sam Malone.
I remember seeing you out at Fenway.
Yeah.
Well, it looks like you've taken pretty good care of yourself.
Yeah, I work at it.
You're not looking too shabby there yourself.
I can do more pushups now than when I was 20.
Hey, me too, you know.
Me too.
Really.
As a matter of fact, I haven't felt better in my entire life.
You know, they say a man reaches his sexual peak at 1 8.
Bet some 1 8-year-old said that, huh?
Yeah, the nurses cut the ties on my gown here.
- Get out of here!
- No, I'm not kidding!
- Hey, here's my gal now.
- Oh, well.
Hey, Judy.
Judy, I want you to meet Sam Malone.
Isn't she something, Sam?
Sure is.
Listen, if you ever wanna dump him, you can make a house call on Sammy here anytime you want.
Hey, Sam, this is my daughter you're talking to.
Your daughter, really?
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
It's all right.
Come on, honey, let's take a look around, huh?
Nice to meet you, sir.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Hey, Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
Miss Chambers, can I ask you something?
You're a girl, right?
Well, I'm a woman.
Well, that's close enough.
You see, in about five minutes I'm going out on my first date with a city girl, and I'm really nervous about it.
You know, I'm afraid I might get tongue-tied and make a fool of myself.
I don't want that to get in the way of me picking up the babes.
Et tu, Woody?
After only a few months here at Cheers, you're starting to talk like the other reprobates.
Well, thanks, Miss Chambers, but, you know that's not enough.
I wanna be smooth with the ladies like Sam.
Well, I think I can help you out.
Have a seat.
A good conversationalist is usually a good listener.
I've found that people love to talk about themselves.
- Really?
- Oh, yes.
People have an endless fascination with their own little world.
It's an observation I made as a small child, although I've never understood why it holds true.
I, myself, have always found many more interesting topics to talk about.
Of course, I've always made it a point to broaden my horizons.
As a matter of fact, I was reading the New York Times at the age of 4.
And from then, on to the classics.
Of course, it caused some hardships as a youngster, always being far and away the brightest in the class.
Usually, the brightest in the class is regarded as some sort of a pimply faced egghead.
I'm sorry, Clifford, what was your question again?
Boy, just when you think you can't get any older, you go and read the paper.
- Why?
What happened?
- Look at this.
There's gonna be a reunion of The Boston Boppers.
Oh, my goodness.
Look at that.
- Who are The Boston Boppers?
- It's not a who, it's a what.
Like you.
It was a local TV show, kind of like American Bandstand.
- Carla used to dance on it.
- Oh, yeah.
I danced my way into New England's heart.
Till they made up that stupid rule.
What rule's that?
The one that said that pregnant Those were repressive times.
Well, you must be very excited about the reunion, Carla.
I'm not going.
Oh, how come?
I thought you loved that place.
I did love it.
But Nick was my dance partner.
That was before we had to get married.
Boy, they sure have tough dance laws up here.
Wipe that table off there, will you, Woody?
We were a great team.
We really got along when we were dancing.
And when we were dancing, if you know what I mean.
Yes, it's frighteningly clear.
Well, why don't you just ask Nick if he wants to go?
Forget it.
Oh, come on.
You're not gonna pass up all that fun just for a little pride, are you?
It's not only fun.
There's a chance to win 500 bucks and a trip to Hawaii in that dance contest.
And we could do it.
- Then what--?
- There's no way I'd call and ask him.
And I really don't want anyone else getting any crazy ideas, like calling him in Atlantic City at 555-4397.
Well, here I go, out of earshot in the poolroom for about 1 5 minutes.
Oh, Carla.
Hey, I got an idea.
Why don't one of us call Nick?
That'd be a good idea.
- Anybody know the area code?
- 609!
Thank you.
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!
How's life, Mr. Peterson?
Oh, I look at it every once in a while when I'm in the john.
I didn't mean the magazine.
Neither did l. - So how's that job-hunt going, Norm?
- Great.
- Hey, you got one, huh?
- Yeah, well.
No, no.
Vera did.
Boy, Normie, don't you feel the least bit emasculated?
I mean, isn't it gut-wrenching to watch your wife go off to work every morning?
It's gut-wrenching to watch Vera do anything.
- Who are you?
- I'm Woody Boyd.
Big deal.
Where--?
Where is everybody?
Oh, there's those two bozos.
Nick, Loretta.
Hello, sweetcakes.
You been thinking about me?
Only during flea-and-tick season.
Yeah?
Well, in my neighbourhood, that's all year round.
I'm sure it is.
- Hey, Nick.
- Sam.
- Hi, Loretta.
- Hello.
- Excuse me.
Glad you made it.
- Of course I made it.
Anytime Carla needs a favour, and I can benefit financially, and you send me the bus fare, I'm there.
Hey, that's quite a testimonial.
So how you doing?
You still in the TV-repair business?
That's a sideline now.
I'm into bigger and better things.
What do you got there?
"Nick's Talent Emporium, Hi-Class Talent for Less.
Nick Tortelli, Talent Manager".
Well, I'll be darned.
I only got one.
Nick's managing my career now.
Oh, yeah?
You still singing with the Grinning Americans?
Boy, I love that group.
Oh, step into the '80s.
The Grinning Americans are so pass√© it's laughable.
I'm with the Lemon Sisters.
The Lemon Sisters?
Yeah, it's Loretta and two other dames.
I thought up the name.
Well, don't people confuse you with the Lennon Sisters?
I don't know.
Do they throw their drinks at The Lennon Sisters?
It's pure coincidence that the names sound alike.
Besides, I got other people on my roster.
I also handle Wayne Newman.
Ginger ale and a Scotch.
Nick Tortelli?
As I live and breathe, what a surprise.
What do you say, Carla?
Are we gonna kill them at that dance contest?
You came here to go to that dance contest with me?
Sure.
Yeah, I'm gonna win that contest and go to Hawaii, where the girls wear grass skirts.
And I'm planning on bringing my hedge clippers.
You gotta admit, the guy's a panic.
I can't believe it.
You guys really used to rock out on The Boston Boppers, huh?
Sure.
We were the stars.
They couldn't stop us.
Hey, you remember the host, Floyd Panjeric?
Yeah, what a dork.
Remember that time we pantsed him during the station break?
It's gonna be great to see everybody.
I just hope I can dance as good.
I - I'm a little rusty.
- Oh, no sweat.
I'm in great shape.
I'm glad to hear that, Carla, but it takes two to tango.
And if I'm rusty, we're nowhere.
What's that supposed to mean?
Look, I'm trying to be a gentleman here.
Everybody knew who was more talented.
- Yeah, me.
- Give me a break.
I carried you.
You carried me?
I carried you.
In your hat.
I carried you!
In your hat!
I carried you!
Carla, the fact is, I can go to the dance with a monkey and win that contest.
Oh, yeah?
Who'd lead?
That's it.
If you were the last babe on earth, I wouldn't dance with you.
I got an idea.
I'm gonna show you how good a dancer I am.
I'm gonna go with Loretta.
Oh, Nicky, I'm honoured.
We haven't danced since our wedding.
And we've never danced fully clothed.
There you go.
It's me and Loretta.
And you, Carla, can eat dirt.
That's what you think.
I'm gonna get myself a new partner and beat the pants off of you.
Oh, yeah?
Who are you gonna get?
Eddie Csznyk.
Eddie Csznyk, the Polish Prancer?
That's right.
He was always wanting to dance with me, and I always turned him down to go with you.
Yeah, that was the last smart move you ever made.
Come on, Loretta, we're gonna practice until our feet bleed.
Okay.
Bye, gang at Cheers.
Hey, Carla, I saw him, I saw him.
He's dancing down the street.
Boy, he's beautiful.
Makes Fred Astaire look like a gorilla.
- You sure it's him?
- Yeah, I'm sure it's him.
I called out, "Hey, Eddie Csznyk," and he waved back.
This is it.
My luck is finally changing.
- Eddie!
- Carla!
Check out my footwork.
Eddie, your shoelace is un tied.
Good luck, Carla.
I'm really sorry about this.
- Knock them dead, kid.
- Yeah, yeah.
Listen, mac, I'd put a cervical collar on that knee.
Give him Give him about Better make that 40.
- What are you gonna do now?
- I don't know.
I gotta get another partner.
Does anybody here dance?
I should've known better.
The only time I've seen any of you dance is when the restrooms are crowded.
Sam?
- Why don't you help her out.
- What are you talking about?
Oh, you know very well what I'm talking about.
You're a great dancer.
You won that trophy at our ballroom-dancing class.
Don't, don't The fact that you talked me into taking that stupid class is embarrassing enough.
- Sam, are you going to help Carla?
- No, I'm not.
- Why not?
- I am a jock.
I've got an image to protect.
I don't want people thinking I'm too graceful, if you know what I mean.
There's nothing wrong with being graceful.
I'm not worried about being graceful.
I'm worried about being too graceful.
It's not like you're being asked to perform Swan Lake in a tutu.
Why did that particular image come to mind?
Sam, please.
Baryshnikov is graceful, and he's one of the sexiest men alive.
Oh, come on.
Barysh We all know why women go for Baryshnikov.
- Oh, and why is that?
- Well, because of what he wears.
I mean, those tights have no secrets.
Don't believe everything you see, Sammy.
You know, I think he's padded.
Probably orders it from that catalogue.
What catalogue?
Well, I heard some guys talking.
Well, no luck back there either.
Well, I can still take the honourable way out.
I'm going home to burn my feet on the radiator.
No, no, Carla.
Carla, come here.
Come here.
Wait.
Let's see if we can do something here.
Sammy.
You're graceful.
Carla.
- Is that you?
- Yeah.
- Cheryl, is that you?
- Yeah.
We never liked each other very much.
Hey.
What are you doing here with Sam?
I thought you were coming with Eddie Csznyk.
Sam happens to be a much better dancer.
And he has the grace of a swan.
Bull swan.
Hi, kids.
That's the way he started every show.
That's catchy.
A lot of great years, and a lot of great music, and a lot of grey hairs have gone by.
But you know what?
Out of all the music, I think our music was the best music.
- What do you say?
- You're a lame-o!
Oh, you kids.
Spunky as ever.
But we're gonna have a lot of fun tonight.
Hey, I got an idea.
Why don't we see how far we've all come since the old Boston Boppers days?
Tell us the person you most admired then and the person you most admire now.
I'm Cheryl Koski from Brockton.
And back then, I guess the person I admired the most was Frankie Avalon.
- And now?
- Now I'd have to say Fabian.
All right.
All right.
Now that you're warmed up, Iet's get down to what you're all here for: a chance to dance your way to Waikiki.
The rules are simple.
If the judges tap you, you're out.
You know, Sammy, when Nick and I used to go to these dance contests, we always used to spit on each other's shoes for good luck.
Well?
You missed.
I hope you dance better than you spit.
Here we go with "Tutti-Frutti".
Well, I'm sorry, kids.
You're out.
- Oh, come on, man!
- Hey, you stupid Hey, they suck swamp water too.
We have our winners!
Hold it a minute, Floyd.
A great wrong is about to be done.
You know me.
I'm Nick Tortelli.
High school class of '62, '63, '64.
The reason I didn't win this contest is because my partner stunk.
And I refuse to leave until I show you how it's done with my ex-lovely wife, Carla.
Nicky.
- Come on, Carla.
- Forget it, Nick.
Floyd, "Unchained Melody".
Well, guess it's just you and me.
Beg your pardon?
I'd like to do something with you that'll make him sorry.
And I don't mean dancing.
Do you have a van?
I don't really think you wanna do something you're gonna regret later.
Oh, yes, I do.
And I wanna do it right now.
And I'm good too.
Even though I don't like it very much.
You're making too big a deal out of this.
I mean, it's just a dance.
How good?
Introducing the winner of The Boston Boppers dance contest, Miss Carla Tortelli!
Oh, yay!
That's wonderful.
- You two did it.
- Well, no, no.
Actually, Carla and Nick won.
I guess I just wasn't graceful enough.
Come on, Sammy.
You were plenty graceful.
No, I wasn't.
No, really.
You should've seen Carla and Nick out there.
They were like Fred and Ethel.
Really.
Yeah, it was a magical moment.
You know, it was like I was transported back in time.
I wasn't a tired old woman with six kids.
I was a fresh young teenager with two kids.
Come on, you guys.
Let me drive you home.
Oh, good.
Sammy, I think I just wanna sit here for a little while and bask in the glow.
Relive the moment and have a couple of belts.
Yeah, enjoy.
Thanks.
Congratulations, Carla.
Now, aren't you glad you went?
I'll bet you looked great out there on the dance floor.
Yeah, I did, actually.
You know, why don't you come by my place, and I'll show you my Watusi?
And then later on, we can dance a little bit.
On second thought, I'm going to hitchhike.
You meet a better class of people.
My love, my darling I hunger for your touch - What are you doing here?
- I had to see you.
Carla tonight was destiny.
What are you talking about?
It was destiny that Eddie Csznyk fell down those stairs.
And it was destiny that The Boppers even had a reunion.
And it was destiny that we won the contest.
When we were dancing out on that floor tonight, we were like the only two people on earth.
I know we belong together, and we always will.
Come on, Nick.
We're great when we're on the dance floor, but when the music stops, we stink on ice.
No, no.
We were meant to be together.
Carla, you know me.
Look in my eyes and you'll know I'll tell you the truth.
- You're serious.
- Yeah.
What are you saying?
I'm saying I want you to go to Hawaii with me tonight.
Now.
Please, Carla.
Make this dream of mine come true.
- Tonight was incredible.
- Yeah.
- Wow, you and me in Hawaii.
- Yeah.
- Palm trees.
- Palm trees.
- Sipping mai tais on the beach.
- Yeah, mai tais.
- lt'd be paradise.
- Yeah.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
- What about Loretta?
- What about her?
She's waiting for us at the airport.
Is that a no?
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
Oh, no.
It's almost 5:00.
What's the problem with 5:00, Woody?
Well, every day at 5, this guy comes in and blabbers and blabbers and talks my ear off.
- I don't know what to do.
- Why don't you do what I do.
Tell him to shut his fat, ugly mouth.
Oh, no, it's not Mr Clavin.
Woody, Woody.
Calm yourself.
There's no need for concern.
I'm sure he's just a lonely man who wandered in here one day and found a sympathetic ear.
Unfortunately, indulging him will only aggravate the problem.
You see, people in this situation have a tendency to prattle on endlessly, totally unaware of how others are receiving this unwanted, innocuous information.
Now, the next time a neurotic personality such as this gets off on one of these jags, just turn your back and walk away.
Because, you see, the important thing is, well Well, just a second, I was Oh, you merry band.
- Diane here yet?
- No, no.
Miss Tardy-Slip is late again.
She probably stopped somewhere to think up another lame-o excuse for being late in the first place.
I'm sorry I'm late.
I was taking a nap, and I forgot to set my alarm.
And my down comforter felt so toasty.
Well, you know me.
I'm something of a slumber cat.
Jack Dalton called.
Oh, my God.
Jack Dalton?
I haven't heard that name for months.
Jack Dalton.
- Who is he?
- Nobody.
Well, Mr Nobody just landed his private jet at Hyannis Port and is coming over to see you right now.
You never mentioned this guy to me.
How come?
Well, there's not much to say.
He's a man I dated a bit in Europe.
Was that before or after you dumped Dr Crane and sent him into an alcoholic tailspin?
After.
How long after?
Days.
I met Jack at the running of the bulls in Pamplona.
Isn't that just like a woman?
While I wept bitterly into the Adriatic, she was busy dodging bovines in sunny Spain.
Frasier, I was upset.
I would have done anything.
I wasn't running to Jack, I was running away from you.
Well, I feel better now.
As fortune would have it, Jack came into my life at that point, and his love of danger intoxicated me.
If he said, "Let's try the luge run at St Moritz," I said, "Why not".
I guess for a brief while, I was danger's mistress.
Is there anyone whose mistress you weren't?
Put a cork in it, Frasier.
Jack is from a period in my life that I would rather put behind me.
I'm more mature now.
More centred.
Sam, I'm going to hide in the back.
When Jack comes, just tell him I'm dead.
Chambers!
Jack.
Diane's dead.
- Still light as a bird, huh?
- Oh, Jack.
Listen, I want you to meet everybody.
This is Carla Tortelli.
Tortelli!
Easy, Hercules.
I just had chilli.
- I'm Woody Boyd.
- Boyd!
- I'm Cliff Clavin.
- Clavin!
Norm Peterson.
Norm.
I got a whistle to wet.
Hey, barkeep, how'd you like to arm-wrestle me for a beer?
Hey, all right!
Alrighty, but I have to warn you, I was arm-wrestling champion of Posey County.
- Fair enough.
- All right.
One, two, three Ladies and gents, the new champ of Posey County.
All right, who's next?
Thanks, not me.
You look like you could give me a run for my money.
I think I'll take a rain check.
Come on, man, just for the sport of it.
Jack, I'll buy you the beer.
You don't have to beat everybody in the bar.
What makes you think I'm gonna lose?
Sam Malone here.
I'm the owner of the bar, and I've yet to lose a beer in it.
Well, there's a first time for everything.
One, two, three So how long you in town for?
Just for the day.
I'm on my way to the Air Races in Reno.
Reno?
Yeah, that's lovely this time of year.
Beautiful.
Well, I guess I owe you a beer here.
Diane, how the hell are you?
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
My God, you look pale.
You folks should've seen her frolicking in the surf at Mykonos.
Her little bottom was as brown as a berry.
The stick running around buck-naked?
- It was a semiprivate beach.
- Used to be a semiprivate bottom.
So, Jack, what's been happening with you lately?
Oh, nothing much.
I spent most of last year in Tibet centring my consciousness with secrets from the Book of the Dead.
Fun place, Tibet.
I studied under this Buddhist monk who had such a pixyish sense of humour.
I remember this one particular morning.
We were clad in goatskin.
The sun was just coming over the Himalayas.
At that moment I took my first trip out of my body to nirvana.
A trip like that could well be deductible.
See, well, I'm a CPA.
Unemployed CPA.
Kind of a funny, unemployed CPA.
Mr Dalton, you've had so many bizarre and terrifying experiences.
Some people say that I have a death wish.
Far from it.
- I have a life wish.
- Yeah, so does Normie.
- What, what, what?
- He wishes he had one.
Hey, Chambers!
Come on, tell us all about you.
Now, the last time I saw you, you turned down my offer to travel around the world because you had a secret love back in Boston.
Baseball player, wasn't it?
Yes, Mickey Mantle.
It didn't work out.
I always say the best remedy for unrequited love is a trip around the world on a raft.
Sound tempting?
Jack, I feel kind of settled now.
I'll admit that when you knew me in Europe, it was important for me to test myself that way.
And I was rather fearless.
But that was the nadir of my existence.
My life now is complete and happy, and I'm scared of my own shadow.
Well, the least you can do is give me this evening.
Come on, take a spin in my new plane.
I'll show you what that baby can do.
Hey, what kind of aircraft you got up there, Dalton?
Messerschmitt?
Fokker?
No, it's a Bobcat with a couple of Pratt & Whitney JT1 5D-1A engines.
Twenty-two hundred pounds of thrust apiece.
Hey, good little birdy.
Come on, Diane, let's go.
Jack thank you for your kind invitation, but Sam couldn't possibly let me go at the beginning of my shift.
Oh, hey, it's kind of slow tonight.
Why don't you go.
May I speak with you a moment, Sam?
I'd really rather not go flying tonight.
- What?
- Sam, please.
Tell him I have to work tonight, and I couldn't possibly accompany him.
I have a better idea.
Why don't you do it.
You were his berry-bottomed baby.
Maybe you're right.
It's up to me.
Oh, Jack.
I think it would be better if I didn't go out with you tonight.
No, no, no.
Say it ain't so.
The crazy, impulsive Diane I knew in Europe has turned into Miss Nine-to-Five, Play-lt-Safe, Dare-l-Eat-a-Peach?
What a shame.
So long, Diane.
- Well, you don't have to be angry.
- I'm not angry.
I'm just sad at what's lost.
The army of dullness has recruited another soul.
Well, a little spin doesn't sound so bad.
It's a very clear night.
Hey!
Does the woman ever say no?
Only to you.
Jack, just one thing.
Would you mind if Sam accompanies us?
Wait, how'd I get on board this thing?
May I speak with you again?
What do you want?
Sam, it would mean a great deal to me if you came along for protection.
He's not the kind of man I trust myself to be alone with.
Oh, yeah.
Like me, you mean?
You do understand.
Okay, all right.
Jack?
I guess I'm coming along.
Hey, the more the merrier.
- Malone!
- Don't do that.
- Shall we go?
- Yeah, I guess so.
Hey, you know, Dalton, a spin up in that little birdy of yours sure sounds inviting.
- Yeah, they'll tell you all about it.
- Yeah, I guess they will.
This is truly lovely.
The moon and stars our only companions as we gently brush aside the billowing clouds.
- Diane, take the controls.
- What?
What'd you say?
Me?
I know nothing about flying.
Well, just put both hands on this like this.
That's right.
Attagirl.
Okay, I heard something rattling around in back there.
Gotta go secure it.
Come on, Sam.
Why don't you sit up there.
That's it.
Come on, the view's great.
Okay, now, just fly her steady as she goes.
Don't touch any controls.
Don't touch anything.
You're headed in the right direction.
Hi, Diane.
Hey, Jack?
What do you call this steering-wheel thing here?
It's called a steering wheel.
No, I'm just kidding.
It's called a yoke.
A bad yoke.
This is so frightening.
And yet exhilarating.
It's okay.
It's okay.
I think we're getting the hang of this, Sam.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Feeling pretty powerful, huh?
Well, I have to admit, I kind of feel like I own the sky.
- Jack is really something, isn't he?
- Are you kidding me?
I mean I could do all that macho stuff if I wanted to, but it wouldn't make me any more of a man.
Do I detect a hint of raised consciousness?
Yeah.
I mean, a real guy doesn't have to jump on sharks and dodge poison darts just to prove he's a guy.
I'm astonished.
A real guy just has to score heavy with the babes, that's all.
Hey, Jack.
Hey, Jack, you know, I have to admit, you're right.
This is kind of fun.
Jack?
Yo, Jack?
Well, he couldn't have gone too far.
Unless he bailed out.
- Jack?
- Jack?
Sam?
He's dead.
- What do you mean dead?
- I mean "dead," dead.
- He hasn't got a pulse.
- Oh, come on.
I can't believe a guy like that's ever gonna die.
Yeah?
Well, trust me.
Like hell I will.
We're going to crash.
We're going to die.
They'll check out our dental records to identify our remains.
And I haven't been to Dr Oberding for as much as a polish in over six months.
- He's dead.
- I know, dead.
Okay.
All right, but we're not dead yet.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
All right.
All right, I saw this movie once where this perfectly ordinary lady had to land this airliner.
So all we gotta do now is make radio contact with some guy on the ground, and he'll talk us down onto the runway.
What do you remember?
Wait, what do you remember?
I remember thinking that, "These people are in a lot of trouble".
Sam, we're going to die.
Hey, hey.
Do you mind, please?
I'm in complete control here, Diane.
I just gotta find the damn radio, that's all.
How do you know which one is the radio?
- I don't.
- Will you stop indiscriminately pushing buttons?
Oh, my God.
I don't wanna die.
- You're not making this any easier.
- We're too young.
Just relax, will you?
I mean, we're still flying, aren't we?
We're still going in a basically straight line here.
And we got plenty of fuel, according to the fuel-gauge thing there.
That's a clock.
Well, all right.
It's early.
We've still got a lot of time to sort this whole thing out.
Damn.
You're right, you're right.
We're still aloft.
Maybe somebody will pick us up on their radar or something and talk us down, and everything will be wonderful.
- Oh, Sam, what did you do?
- I don't know.
Well, don't do it again.
We're sinking.
No, don't be silly.
Ships sink.
Planes All right, I'm gonna pull back on this thing here.
Right here.
Okay, here I go.
All right?
- Oh, this is good.
- All right.
All right.
- Yeah, yeah.
- This is good.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Absolutely wonderful.
Okay, all right.
All right, now we're back.
Normal here.
I'm just gonna keep looking for this damn radio.
Please, please, please, please, please.
- Look out!
- Will you stop that!
People don't fly well when people are screaming in their ears.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Good God, please, please.
Oh, God, please.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, Jesus.
- Sam, I think we're going down.
- Yeah, I think so too.
Oh, God, I can't believe this.
All right.
All right.
All right.
Let's just have a little dignity here and try to be calm, huh?
- How do we do that?
- Oh, Jesus.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Talk about something.
- Like what?
- Anything.
Talk about anything.
Talk about all the good things that have happened to us, huh?
Good things?
What about all the things that are never gonna happen?
I'm never gonna get married.
I'm never gonna have a baby.
I'm never gonna get old.
I don't even have a grey hair.
- Sure you do, right there.
- I do?
Where?
- Oh, please, please.
- Sam, hold me.
Oh, God.
Oh, it would have been us one of these days, wouldn't it?
You and me married?
Yeah, yeah.
- Little Sams and Dianes running - Oh, yeah.
Oh, God.
Why didn't I ask you when I had the chance?
- Why did I go to Europe?
- Oh, it's okay.
- At least we're going together.
- Yeah.
I love it.
Jack, what the hell are you doing alive?
Dalton, fly the damn plane.
It was a little trick I learned in Tibet.
I slowed my metabolism down to a heartbeat a minute.
- Why the hell did you do that, Jack?
- Fly the damn plane, will you, man.
- This is about to crash.
- Oh, we're not gonna crash.
- We're at 20,000 feet.
- Big deal, Jack.
Hey, relax, folks.
You were on autopilot the whole time.
Well, you were when I left.
Who's been screwing around with the controls here, huh?
That was the rottenest, stupidest, sleaziest thing anyone's ever done.
Chambers, I saw comfortable and safe and domestic written all over your face tonight and couldn't stand it.
You needed this.
You too, Malone.
You needed a step to the brink.
You needed to look into the gaping maw of death and live to tell about it.
I'm gonna stick my fist in your gaping maw.
Oh, no, you won't.
You'll live to thank me.
From this day forward, you're reborn.
Everything in your life's gonna be better.
- You're crazy.
- Food is gonna taste better.
- I don't care.
- Flowers are gonna smell better.
- You're nuts.
- Sex is gonna feel better.
Well, I never want to see you again as long as I live.
You're a big, dangerous baby, Jack Dalton.
- That's right, yeah.
- And regressing at a rapid pace.
You know something?
You know, I feel like punching your lights out.
Sam.
Sam, he's the only one that knows how to land the plane.
That's right.
Okay, all right, all right.
Yeah, but when we get on the ground, you are dog meat, friend.
So, Sam, you never did tell us how you got that shiner.
We hit some turbulence there, and l knocked myself into the alta-gyroscope thing.
Oh, boy, when are they ever gonna recess those things, huh?
Is that gizmo there in the shape of a fist?
All right, so Dalton caught me with a sucker punch.
- Yeah, but you should see him.
- We got even.
We told the FAA on him.
So, what did you guys talk about when you thought you were gonna die?
Oh, I don't know You remember anything, Diane?
Not a word.
There were a lot of frightening things going on.
Well, I'm kind of tired.
I'm gonna get ready to go.
Well, you know, Normie, all this talk of danger has inspired me to go out and do something really crazy, eh?
What do you say you and me go out and ring some doorbells and run away, eh?
Yeah, yeah.
Mind if I get going, Sam?
In ten minutes, my sitter's going on overtime, and my kids ain't worth a buck an hour.
- Go, go.
Yeah.
- Thanks.
You're a pal.
Hey, Sam, I want you to know, if I'm ever in a life-or-death situation and things look hopeless, like there's no way of getting out alive, I want you there with me.
Thanks, buddy.
No, no, wait.
Don't leave me here with Where did everybody go?
Oh, home, I guess.
- Well, I guess I'll do the same.
- Yeah.
Quite a night, right, Sam?
Yeah, quite a night.
- Good night.
- Yeah, good night.
Look, Sam some things were said between us that have never been said before.
And they were said because we were facing death.
And now that the crisis is over, I think we should set aside some of those things for when we can better deal with them.
What I'm trying to say is that I think we should, for the time being, forget what was said on that plane.
Hey, what plane, huh?
The plane where you said your deepest desire was to marry me.
Oh, yeah, that plane.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Hey, Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
Hey, man, where's this relief waitress you hired?
Oh, don't worry, Sam, she's a great waitress, a complete professional.
Well, how come she's not here?
Well, she called and said she'd be about 20 minutes late.
She wants to get in all her breaks before she starts.
Oh, there she is.
Hey, Corinne, over here.
When you asked them for a waitress, did you tell them this was a bar, not a truck stop?
Hi, honey.
Is this it?
Yep, Corinne, this is my boss, Sam Malone.
Hi, honey.
Just give me some checks and we're all set.
Okay, Woody, why don't you show her where they are?
It's right down here.
Would you look at the size of this place?
My dogs'll be barking tonight.
Pardon me, am I mistaken, or did you used to work at the Hungry Heifer?
- Sure, I worked there.
- Yeah?
Say, I know you.
The girls there had a pet name for you.
- What was that?
- That guy who comes back.
Hey, listen, thanks for helping out.
From now on let me pick the waitresses.
My customers are used to something with a little more sex appeal.
Sam.
Where'd you get the fox?
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!
- How's life in the fast lane, Normie?
- Beats me.
I can't find the on-ramp.
Hey, hey, your brow is a little furrowed there, my friend.
What's the boney, Maroney?
Well, Vera's getting the urge to go on vacation again.
Don't worry.
It'll pass.
Happens every year.
I think she's serious this time.
Maps have been unfolded.
- Where does she wanna go?
- The tropics.
Says she wants to lay in the sand and bake in the sun.
I offered a compromise.
I said, just turn up the radiator and stick your feet in the cat box.
- And she didn't go for that?
- No, no.
It's my own damn fault.
You know, I think I've spoiled that woman.
Mr Peterson, if you want the vacation of a lifetime, without spending a fortune, I have one word for you: - Yeah?
- Hanover, lndiana.
All right.
Well, what would I do for excitement in, say, Hanover, lndiana?
Well, if you leave right away, you can catch the Corn Parade.
Now, that's kind of like the Rose Parade.
But instead of using flowers for the floats-- - They use corn.
- You've heard of it.
Well, hold on a second.
- Carla, it's for you.
- Who is it?
I don't know.
It's one of your daughters.
- Which one?
- I couldn't tell.
- It sounded like, "Humanity".
- Oh, it's Anne Marie.
She's wearing a retainer on her teeth, and she's feeling a little insecure.
Anne Marie?
No, I didn't know it was you from your ugly voice.
Hon, no.
Anne Marie, people are not gonna make fun of you every time you open your mouth.
Honey, your family are not people.
Yeah, right, goodbye.
Poor kid.
I remember when I was at that awkward age.
Any little difference between me and the other children and I was embarrassed and humiliated in front of what felt like the world.
- Hi, Diane.
- And on it goes.
You left your sweater at my apartment.
Oh, thank you, Dennis.
And thanks for bringing it by in this all-too-brief visit.
- Why are you dressed like that?
- I'm working the Renaissance Faire.
Don't they have dressing rooms there?
I thought you'd get a kick out of it.
You said it was your favourite era.
Dennis, there's a time and place for everything.
And the time for this was the 14th century.
I'm sorry.
So are we still on for Saturday night?
Next Saturday would be impossible.
You don't wanna go out with me again, do you?
I didn't say that, Dennis.
You're putting words in my mouth.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to.
No, no, they're the right words.
I'll give you a call, Dennis.
All right.
I know what's coming.
Let's get on with it.
- What?
What are you talking about?
- You know.
Dennis.
He didn't, well - He didn't look very ordinary.
- Oh, nonsense.
I thought he looked great.
Especially if he was gonna spend the day in Sherwood Forest.
You're not being very fair.
Dennis is a really special guy.
Yeah, and I sensed that, Diane.
I said to myself-- As soon as he walked in, I said, now there's a sissy with a dream.
Dennis Kaufman is a brilliant puppeteer.
He does a wonderful Punch and Judy.
He'd better have a wonderful punch if he's gonna dress like Judy.
Oh, you really pick them, Diane.
Next to him, even Frasier looks like Rambo.
Look what I've stooped to.
Dennis is a fine human being, and I hustled him out of here like he had the plague.
All in an effort to avoid your childish gibes.
How will I ever make it up to him?
Well, you could always offer to set his hair.
Fine, fine.
Thank you all.
Oh, come on.
You're overreacting.
We were simply indulging in a couple of yuks.
Were we not, guys?
Well, I can understand why you act like this, and Sam stooping to such puerile behaviour.
You're jealous.
But I don't know why everyone else jumps in.
Now, Woody here was the only one of you mature enough to refrain from jumping on your mudslinging bandwagon.
Well, why should l, Miss Chambers?
I liked Denise.
- No, that's Dennis.
- I know.
Hey, Normie?
You feel like doing something adventurous tonight?
I'm already doing that, Cliffie.
Vera's trying on a new facial mask this evening, and I kind of wanna rush home and watch it crack.
- All right.
- Why?
What did you have in mind?
Well, I heard from one of the guys down in the junk-mail room that there's a new act down at the old Wham Bam Room.
Oh, hot dog.
Presenting the finest in nudie entertainment.
Come on, Fras, what do you say?
Let's go.
Oh, you're inviting me along to this evening of devilment?
- You got a credit card, don't you?
- There you go.
You know, I'm not so sure if it really fits in with my image, you know?
A desperately lonely character on the make?
- Well, I guess I'm in.
- All right.
Oh, sure.
Just when I'm about to have fun.
- That's Mrs Benedict.
- How did you know that?
Because she's the person I'd least like to hear from.
Even her beep is whiny.
Excuse me, just two seconds.
Guys, Carla, get your coats.
You're coming over to my place.
Tonight, on the tube, The Magnificent Seven.
Cliffie, the Wham Bam Room will always be there, but only tonight will the Seven ride.
Say no more.
Bronson, McQueen, Coburn.
- Don't think I ever saw that one.
- You're kidding.
Then tonight you become a man.
- Well, I'm off.
- Hey, change of plans, Frasier.
The Magnificent Seven, Sammy's TV, tonight.
The Seven?
Great.
I never miss a Horst Buchholz film.
Listen, l-- Tell you what.
I'll catch up to you just as soon as I talk Mrs Benedict out of her hamper.
You guys do this a lot?
Well, yeah, every time one of the classics is on TV, we all head over to Sammy's, make some popcorn, and glue our eyeballs to the set.
You know, I'm not ordinarily a fan of American Westerns, but because The Magnificent Seven is a remake of the far superior and more complex Japanese film, The Seven Samurai, a comparison will be interesting.
We'll be sure to do that.
Now you don't mind locking up, do you, sweetheart?
Oh, of course not.
We didn't hear anything.
No, no, I'm gonna check this out.
I'm sorry.
You wanna come with us, sweetheart?
No.
I don't wanna ruin your fun.
When I first walked into this place, I felt like an alien, and four years later, I still feel like an alien.
Well, if the antenna fits.
Diane, wait a second.
- I just wanna go home, Sam.
- Well, maybe if you I don't know, guys.
I don't feel good about the movie tonight.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Cheers.
Oh, hi, Diane.
Why aren't you here?
Are you sick or something?
Oh, well, you sound all stuffed up.
Well, I hope you feel better.
Bye-bye.
- What's the matter with her?
- She said she's got this allergy where you weep uncontrollably.
What do you think?
Do you think we hurt her feelings a little bit too much last night?
Hey, maybe we ought to do something to make it up to her.
- Like send her a bouquet of flowers.
- Oh, clich√© city, huh?
You know, whenever I break the heart of a member of the gentler sex, I always send her a nice box of dried figs.
Figs won't do it.
Let me see if I can explain this.
Diane has always tried to take part in your activities.
Why don't you return the favour by joining her in something she finds entertaining?
Oh, boy.
All right, what egghead torture do we have to endure now?
Well, how about the opera?
- Oh, man, come on.
- Oh, gross.
It's not like we threw her down a flight of stairs.
Come on.
Tell you what.
Leave it to me.
I'll make all the arrangements, right down to her favourite flowers.
All you guys have to do is just show up.
All right, what do you say, guys?
I mean, it's the least we could do.
- Well?
- All right, all right, all right.
Do me a favour, just pick an opera where it doesn't sound like somebody backing over a cat.
Please.
We do happen to be in luck.
You see, they're playing Diane's favourite tomorrow night.
Lucia di Lammermoor by Donizetti.
Yeah?
Well, count me out.
You know, every time we had a family gathering, they always tried to get me interested in opera.
I just couldn't stand it.
It's just a bunch of fat, homely people screeching and trying to stab each other.
Well, Carla, you know, not all operas are like that.
I was talking about the family gathering.
Check it out, boys.
Better than the skyview seats at Fenway.
Look at these chairs.
They're not even bolted down.
Oh, hey, that's class for you.
Boy, you gotta really hand it to Frasier, don't you?
He really knows what melts Diane's butter.
Look at this.
All right, all right, now if we stick together tonight, I think we won't have any casualties.
Hey, hey, just as long as you remember your job there, Woody.
Anybody starts falling asleep, give them a nudge.
Hey, don't worry, Mr Clavin.
There's no way I'm gonna fall asleep.
I had a four-hour nap this afternoon, drank 12 cups of coffee, and I'm wearing extra-tight shoes.
- So where's Diane?
- Oh, she's powdering her nose.
She started to cry again.
I mean, what a woman, huh?
Do you believe that?
She started to cry when we told her we're gonna take her to the opera, she cried when she saw us in our tuxes.
And she cried when she saw the limo.
She's got it under control, though.
She said she won't do it anymore.
No, thank you.
I'll seat myself.
Oh, this is the best box.
- Now, you promised-- - I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.
Madame, your seat.
No, no.
Come on, yeah, that's good.
Gentlemen.
What a glorious night.
Somebody pinch me.
That's just an expression, Cliff.
On second thought, don't pinch me.
If this is a dream, I do not want to awaken.
Listen, I know that you're all novices to the opera, so I'd like to give you a little background.
Tonight's performance is in ltalian.
I'm sure that you will find it both enlightening and entertaining.
Oh, by the way, does anyone need opera glasses?
Oh, no, no.
I brought a pair of my own there, Diane.
Cliffie, think those are powerful enough, pal?
You better believe it, Norm.
Get a load of the warheads on that cellist.
No, hey, hey, hey.
Don't, don't, don't.
So this charming piece is in three acts.
It begins with Edgardo leaving for France to renew his vow of love for Lucia.
Though both houses have maintained a feud for years.
Enrico, Lucia's brother, arranges a marriage between his friend Arturo and Lucia by tricking her into believing that Edgardo has been untrue.
But let's watch.
The maestro.
Wasn't that lovely?
Good night.
Good night.
So how'd it go?
Well, I had a problem with one of the customers.
- Oh, yeah, what?
- He refused to keep his hands on me.
- Go home.
I'll finish up here.
- Thanks.
Yeah.
Diane, you probably noticed I wasn't there tonight.
Oh, yes.
Thank you, Carla.
- It was a really sweet gesture.
- You're welcome.
- May I offer you a cognac?
- Yes, that would be lovely.
Thank you again, Sam, for your thoughtfulness.
It may not seem like much to you, but it really meant a lot to me.
No, no, it seemed like quite a bit to us too.
This evening was so special, so wonderful to me.
And it was all your doing.
Well, there were some other people involved.
Oh, no, you're their leader.
They do nothing without you.
- Well - But so gallant.
Well, thank you.
I can't help helping, I guess.
Every detail was so well-thought-out, right down to your choice of opera.
Oh, well, I knew that Lucywas your favourite.
It was perfect.
You hit all the right chords.
Well, I think I know you pretty well by now.
Sam, I confess, I underestimated you.
I had no idea you thought so much about me in ways other than sexual.
Unfortunately, I can't possibly do that at the moment.
Oh, Sam.
You moved me very deeply tonight.
Well, it moves me deeply to move you deeply.
Speaking of depths, would I be sinking to one if I were to suggest that we carry this conversation back to my place?
- Sam, my God.
- Oh, dear, what?
I wasn't expecting this.
I'm experiencing emotions I haven't felt for so long.
My heart's saying yes, my mind's saying no.
Well, why don't you let some other part of your body break the tie for you?
I think I'd better go.
My purse.
Oh, boy.
Oh, Sam, I can't fight it.
Everything tonight has been leading me right into your arms.
Let me get this clear here.
You're saying that we-- We always get into so much trouble when we talk.
Let's not.
Let's just do.
From now on, no words.
I can't believe this.
This is like a dream I had once.
- This was good back here.
- Yeah, it was.
This is becoming the most perfect evening we've ever had together.
Oh, boy.
Sam?
- What is it?
- Oh, l-- I can't believe I'm about to say this.
I gotta be honest with you.
Frasier planned the whole evening.
I had nothing to do with it.
What do you think about that?
Now Your saying this to me now is one of the most wonderful things you have ever done.
Oh, boy.
I'm even more attracted to you now than before.
Oh, that's great.
Oh, that's great.
Let's go.
- Sam, wait.
- No, no, don't say wait.
Don't say wait.
- We can't possibly have sex tonight.
- Sure we can.
Sure we can.
No, don't you realize what you did?
You insisted on being honest to me.
Respecting me as a person.
Even though it meant risking the loss of a night of passion.
Yeah, well, that kind of stuff should be rewarded, you know?
Sam, you know, for a change, tonight you had the cooler head, and you were right to stop me.
We are developing a very special relationship, and it would be wrong to jeopardize it by having sex.
No.
I want to jeopardize it with sex.
- It would be a test.
- Sam.
Sam, we're regressing.
You're backsliding.
We're not ready yet.
Well, do you have an estimate on when we might be ready?
I mean, is it minutes here?
Come on.
Sam, this was a real breakthrough for us.
I think it's very important for each of us to be alone.
No, I agree.
As soon as we're done, I'll leave.
I promise.
- Good night, Sam.
- No, no, wait.
Here.
Oh, no.
No.
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
You go all over town There ought to be a law.
- Bunch of meatheads.
- So it's true.
He keeps on talking even when people aren't there.
Yes, but if no one's there to hear it, does he really make a sound?
Cliffie, is it worth my asking what the problem is?
Yeah, Norm, it's my transmission.
Spend day after day taking it to garages all over town, - nobody can fix it.
- Here we go, Cliffie.
Pierson's Garage, Braintree.
They can fix anything.
All right?
Yeah, well, yeah.
Thank you very much, Normie.
You know, my toaster's on the blink.
You think they could fix it?
Well, only if you got one in your car.
See, they're auto mechanics, Woody.
Oh, great, it's in the back seat right now.
All right, all right.
Take it easy, Norm.
The kid's good, but you can take him.
All right, I have to select my words rather carefully here.
Woody, they can fix only those things that originally came with the car when you bought it.
As far as I know, cars don't come with toasters.
Well, mine did.
It was part of a promotional campaign.
You know, if I'd bought a convertible, I'd have got a food processor.
Ask for Luis.
He doesn't speak English.
Woody, whisky neat.
Frasier, what are you doing here?
I thought you had a date tonight.
I did, but when I showed up, she was in the middle of a shower.
Well, couldn't you wait?
It was her bridal shower.
Next time I make a date two months in advance, I'll call to confirm.
Afternoon, everybody.
- Hey, Sam, how were the mountains?
- It rained all weekend.
Sam, you forgot this.
Yeah, thank you.
In other words, it was great.
Hey, Diane, how you doing there?
How am I doing?
Did you ask me how I'm doing?
No, not me.
That was Woody.
He's a ventriloquist.
Why?
What's the matter?
- Last week - Yeah?
we were at passion's portal standing on the threshold of a new and excitingly textured relationship.
We were about to open the door on a brand-new beginning for us.
Well, I knocked at the door, but nobody was home, so I went to the mountains with the girl next door.
I see.
Apparently last week meant more to me than it did to you.
Come on, what are you doing here?
Are you saying that even though we're not really going together, you want me not to date anybody else?
It's not what I want, Sam.
It's what you want that's important.
Well, good.
Because what l wanted to do was go to the mountains with Andrea.
Very well.
Let's just forget the whole thing.
Oh, come on, Diane.
It was just physical.
I mean, that stuff doesn't mean anything to me.
Come on, don't you see what I'm doing here?
I'm just honing my skills for that magical night that you and I hit the sheets running.
Sam, you and I will couple when 1,000 ice ages have come and gone.
All right.
How soon do we get to play touchy-feely?
Lighten up, will you?
- Good evening, citizens.
- Looking a little beat, buddy.
Been staying up late watching those adult movies on cable again?
Ma put a lock on that channel.
It's my paperboy, Normie.
He's hitting every place but the front porch.
So I got a little plan worked out now.
All right, get this, 4::30 tomorrow morning in the a.m., I'm gonna put on the old camouflage jacket, stick a couple of branches behind my ears, and duck in the rhododendron bush.
He's smart, but I'm a little bit smarter.
You talking about the kid or the rhododendron bush?
I wanna see all my employees in my office, immediately.
Cheers staff, this means you.
In the office, on the double.
Hey, come on, you heard me.
We didn't hear the magic word.
- Please.
- That's not it.
Come on, Carla, what's the magic word?
Money.
We all want a dollar.
Okay, okay, all right.
Come on, come on, here you go.
Here's one for you.
Here you go.
One for you.
One for you.
Whoa, wait, whoa.
What are you trying to do?
- Beat me out of a buck here?
- Sammy.
I'm here out of a fierce sense of loyalty as your accountant, pal.
And the dollar is your little way of saying thank you.
Well, thank you for coming.
I want you all to take a look at this in the newspaper.
It really got me going here.
"Grown Man Lives in Refrigerator"?
No.
No, no.
Not that part.
Let me see that.
Oh, my God, look at that.
He's got a TV in there.
Sam, what is this about?
Oh, yeah, all right.
Yeah, column three, down at the bottom.
"Don Talbot's Locker Room, Grand Opening".
Yeah, not only that, Don has got two other pubs opening the same time.
I mean, he's doing fantastic business here.
What's this got to do with the guy in the refrigerator?
Nothing, Woody, nothing.
This has to do with me.
This has to do with my life.
I mean, Don was up with the Red Sox for what, a cup of coffee, for goodness sake.
I was there five years, and now this clown is a celebrity, and I'm paying my employees to come talk to me.
You're gonna be paying us a lot more unless this conversation starts getting exciting.
Okay, fair enough.
I brought you in here because I wanna ask you a question: What is Cheers missing?
A mechanical bull.
No, Woody, that was one of those questions you ask when you don't really want an answer.
You mean, rhetorical.
Yeah, rhetorical, right.
Anyway, what I'm gonna do here, is I am gonna come out from behind the bar, and I'm gonna become a full-time manager/host.
A what?
Manager/host.
Yeah, I greet people.
No, it's perfect.
I mean, let's face it.
I'm recognized on the street.
So is a fire hydrant.
You see, at the same time, I'll be able to hustle up some more business, I'll be able to handle the publicity, the quality control, handling bookings.
I mean, it's great.
What do you think?
Is that another rhetorical question?
Well, yeah, it is, Woody, actually, because we're gonna do it.
We're gonna start immediately.
Does that mean you won't be bartending anymore?
I'm glad you asked that.
Now that I've moved up to management, we're gonna have an opening behind the bar, and we're gonna need to fill it.
Wait a minute.
You know, there was a guy in here the other day, - had an application.
He was fantastic-- - Hey, now wait.
Time out, Sammy.
Does this mean that you're gonna be hiring - another full-time bartender?
- Yeah.
I have to advise you, I think that's unwise.
- You sure?
- I'd stake my career on it.
You're unemployed.
All right, I'll stake your career on it.
You really-- You can't afford yourself as a full-time host/manager.
No, see, that's the beauty of it.
As manager, I'll be thinking up new schemes to bring in more business, but I'll be so darned charming as the host, that people will start bringing in more friends.
It's perfect.
I'll be thinking and charming all at the same time.
Add chewing gum, and we can sell tickets.
Sammy, I'm sceptical, but more importantly, I'm thirsty, so Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Thanks for coming in.
Ken, don't forget to run a handkerchief over those shoes.
Mr Malone, they're tennis shoes.
Well, don't spend too long on them then.
Hey, what's with the spread, Sam?
Well, I really topped myself tonight.
I booked a party in here.
The-- Let's see.
The Fraternal Order of the Caribou's sending a group over.
Great.
A group of loudmouthed, rowdy conventioneers, drinking like fish, swearing like sailors, and putting their paws all over us.
Yeah, happy birthday to me.
How many are coming?
Well, I don't know.
They said they're sending over a whole herd, so I guess we're gonna be swamped here.
I just hope we have enough food.
What do you think?
Welcome.
I'm Sam Malone, your host and owner of Cheers.
You may remember me as Mayday Malone, the relief pitcher for the Red Sox?
Anyway, I just want you to know the autographs are free, but the drinks are gonna cost you.
Make him go away, Neal.
Well, welcome.
Carla, a couple tables over here you may wanna get to.
Gee, wait on tables.
Is that what a waitress is supposed to do?
Thanks for the tip, Sam.
Diane, we need a mop over here, please.
I'll buy the bullets if you'll pull the trigger.
Shooting is too quick.
I want him to suffer.
Why don't you date him again?
Get it in gear, girls.
We got new customers coming in.
Not if you greet them.
What?
Sam, this isn't working.
We've done this for a week, and I haven't seen any more customers than there were before you took over as host.
In fact, there are less.
And you haven't come up with one good idea to increase business.
Tonight's different.
I've booked a whole lodge into this place.
I mean, tonight-- Tonight we're making Cheers history here.
A little of the old Malone magic is beginning to spread.
I could use some of that on my flowers.
Just-- Well, Woody, Iooks like the new man behind the bar is working out pretty well, huh?
Yeah, he's doing pretty well considering the pressure he's under.
I mean, after all, working around a man of my experience is probably a little bit intimidating.
Good, he seems to be adjusting.
Excuse me, I'm looking for Sam Malone.
Yeah.
Let go of me, you little devil.
Yes, I am.
I'm-- - I'm the manager.
- Hi.
Nice to meet you.
- Well, thank you.
- Fred Anderson.
- Social Director, Caribou Lodge.
- Yeah, right.
I got you.
- Well, you ready for us?
- You bet I am.
Great, great.
Come on in, guys.
Looks clean.
Gather around, employees, please.
Okay, now, next couple hours it's gonna be hell.
You're gonna be running your little tushies off.
But tonight, when you put your head down on the pillow, you're gonna know it was worth it, because tonight is the night that we put Cheers on the map.
Okay, all right.
You guys are the whole lodge?
Yeah, we just got our charter last week.
You're right, Sam.
We just got on the map.
Cheers, population: three Caribou, one jackass.
Aren't people like that sad?
Huddled together, totally lacking confidence in their own individuality.
And incapable of an original thought.
You know, as Dr Bennett Ludlow once said, "I'll speak no thought but mine own".
All right, I'll admit that things haven't turned out exactly the way I planned them, but it'll be okay.
They'll tell their friends, and their friends will tell their friends.
Do you have anything else?
I'm allergic to shellfish.
Sammy, I'd face reality if I were you.
You have three guys in bad suits and enough food to cater the Crusades.
Next to this, Hula Night was a smashing success.
All right, it's okay.
I know things haven't gone exactly great up to this point, but they will, they will.
I'll think of something.
Hey, skimpy outfits on the waitresses, Sammy.
- That's not bad.
- Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
I don't want people having to look at something I'm ashamed of.
- You got a lovely body.
- Yeah.
I'm talking about hers.
You see, Sammy, topless waitresses, scientific fact, they can deliver drinks faster than their clothed counterparts.
Just forget it, Clavin.
This is just your slimy way of trying to cop a look at my tooters.
Well, everything seems to be running smoothly out here.
Think I'll step in my office and think up some more ideas here.
I don't wanna be disturbed.
Go away, Diane.
Sam, may I speak to you for a minute?
This situation isn't working.
Your schemes aren't working, and you're driving Carla and me crazy, and if you continue this entrepreneurial bent of yours, you're going to bankrupt the bar.
Don't worry about it.
I'll think of something.
Well, I don't know what.
Well, because you don't have my brain.
Well, whoever has it should return it.
You need it right now.
Hey, leave me alone, please.
Oh, Sam, I'm sorry.
It's just obvious what has to happen here.
You have to go back behind the bar.
I know.
I know.
I've known it for a long time.
But why aren't you doing anything about it?
Well, because doing something about it means I have to fire Ken.
Right.
And he's such a nice guy too.
Yeah, damn it.
All right, I've put this off long enough.
Go get Ken.
I'll handle this right now, and I'll do it quickly, cleanly and painlessly.
Just like a surgeon.
Yeah.
Yeah, just like a surgeon.
Very well.
- He's headed this way.
- All right.
I suggest you start scrubbing up, Dr Malone.
- Sam, you got a minute?
- Yeah, Ken.
I'd like you to meet my family.
I just want you to know that it was pretty rough going there for a while, - for the four of us.
- The five of us.
But thanks to you, we've turned the corner.
Kids, this is Mr Sam Malone.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Hi.
Well, this-- This is very nice, Ken, but I do need to talk to you.
Oh, yeah, well, all right, there you go.
Yes, Mr Malone?
Ken I'm giving you a raise.
That's terrific.
Well, thank you.
Thank you, Mr Malone.
Come on, honey, I want to introduce you to the others, okay?
Okay.
Nice to meet you.
Yeah, you too.
You too.
- Come on, children.
- We want to stay with Uncle Sam.
- Is that all right, Sam?
- Sure, sure.
Well, quite an operation, Dr Malone.
What am I gonna do?
I can't fire Woody.
Well, maybe if he knew the situation, he'd wanna go.
Why don't you just explain it to him, and let him draw his own conclusion?
Maybe he'll volunteer to leave.
He's such a sweet guy.
I'll bet he will.
Boy, he is a sweet guy.
Of course he will.
Sam, you look quite natural sitting there with a babe on each knee.
She's seen babes in my lap before.
Yes, but these know how to tie their own shoes.
Goodbye, you sweet little cherubs.
I don't like her.
Try dating her.
Sam, you wanted to see me?
Yes, I do, Woody.
Say, you know Ken's two kids here, don't you?
Yeah, I met them before.
Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Yeah.
Sit down, Woody.
I called you in here because I got a kind of problem.
I hope I can help you, Sam.
Well, I hope so too, Woody.
You know, that scheme of mine to come out from behind the bar and be a host/manager hasn't turned out too well.
Well, that's putting it mildly.
But if it means I'm gonna get you back behind the bar, then I can't say I'm sorry.
Well, it does mean that you're getting me back behind the bar, Woody, but the problem is, I can't afford three bartenders.
You did meet Ken's kids here, haven't you?
- Yeah, I did.
Hi.
- Hi.
So, what it boils down to, Woody, is I'm gonna have to let somebody go.
Boy, that's tough, Sam.
Yeah.
You kids are getting awful heavy here.
Why don't you go sit on old Uncle Woody's lap there, huh?
There you go.
There you go.
Hey, there we go.
Okay, now, Woody, try to follow me closely on this, okay?
Now, see, I can't fire myself because, well, I own the place.
- Well, that makes sense.
- Yeah.
So that means either you or Ken, the father of these two kids.
You get what I'm saying here, Woody?
- No.
- I do.
I do.
No, no, no.
Listen, maybe you kids ought to go now, huh?
Thank you.
Bye-bye, sweetheart, bye-bye.
You're firing me, Sam.
Woody, l-- Boy, I don't know what to say here, man.
Leave Cheers.
You know, I always thought this job was just too good to keep forever.
Well, I understand.
You know, I'm young and unattached, and I can afford to be out of work more than Ken.
- You are the sweetest guy I know.
- You are too, Sam.
Whoa, what are we doing here?
This doesn't have to be a big goodbye.
I'll help you find another job, and if Ken ever leaves, you'll be first in line.
I appreciate that.
Woody-- No, I know what you're gonna say, Sam.
Really?
I don't.
Well, it would have been great.
I'll see you, Sam.
I'm gonna go get my things.
Oh, boy.
Sam, this has gotta be the strangest night of my life.
Yeah, it must be something in the air.
Boy, I don't even know how to bring this up, but Well, there was a guy sitting at the bar, said he was from the Harvard Club.
Wait a minute.
Here's his card.
Anyway, he said he liked the cut of my jib, and he asked me if I wanna go and work for him.
Now the money he's offering would be hard to turn down.
- Sam?
- Woody!
I swear to uphold the bylaws of the lodge and to defend the dignity of the herd.
Woody, Woody, Woody.
Wait, wait, wait, man.
Wait, wait, wait.
Listen, there's somebody in the bar here, somebody from the Harvard Club, who wants to hire Ken, so you don't have to leave.
I mean, just get back behind the bar, man.
God.
What a relief.
Wait a minute, Sam.
What?
What do you think I am?
I got fired from a job that means more to me than anything else in the world, and you want me to just come walking back in here because Ken wants to leave?
Well, I can't do that.
Listen, I need you.
Please, isn't there anything I can do to change your mind here?
- Hundred-dollar-a-month raise?
- Hundred dollars?
No, no, Woody, wait, wait.
I need you.
Yeah, okay, a hundred bucks.
- It's a deal.
- Yeah.
All right.
Boy, yeah, you know, you really surprised me here.
I-- You're a pretty tough negotiator.
Yeah, Sam, boy, I know you think I'm just a country bumpkin.
And the Boyd family may not be too sharp about a lot of things.
I mean, we don't know much about math.
We don't know much about science.
We don't know much about politics.
We don't know much about medicine.
We don't know much about world affairs, but I'll tell you, there's something we're pretty darned sharp about.
What's that?
What were we talking about?
Machinery.
We don't know much about machinery.
I'll tell you, my uncle, he lost his arm in some kind of contraption-- Oh, you're kidding me.
Wait a minute.
- What?
What?
- I remember.
We were talking about money.
That's right.
That's right.
We were talking about your $50-a-month raise.
Sam, it was 1 00 a month.
But you know, I'll tell you.
I think 100 a month is too steep.
- I'll settle for 30 a week.
- You got it.
Host/manager extraordinaire.
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
Oh, boy, that's the third time you beat me, Mike.
- I guess I owe you another beer.
- No, that's okay.
I gotta run.
I'll take a rain check on that one, huh?
Lost again, huh?
Yeah, I don't know what's the matter with me.
It seems like that guy just has my number, you know?
Forget about it.
Next time he comes in here, you just challenge him to some ltalian arm wrestling.
- Oh, I never tried that.
- Come here.
Give me your arm.
Okay, now, I'm gonna pull as hard as I can, and you resist me with all your strength.
- All right.
- Go.
I beat Carla!
And I'm not even ltalian.
You wine them.
You dine them.
Tell them how pretty they are.
Buy them fancy presents.
Finally, you get up the nerve to ask one of the little dears to marry you.
What do you get for all your trouble?
Squat.
I thought you'd pretty much gotten over that Diane problem of yours.
Oh, it's not as serious as it sounds.
See, this is the one-year anniversary of the day Diane deserted me at the altar.
To repress my bitterness would be detrimental to my recovery.
So on this day, and on this day alone, I'm going to spew out my venom and exorcise the blond demon that haunts my soul.
Well, happy anniversary.
Holy moly guacamole.
Terre Haute, lndiana.
Oh, I wouldn't throw her out of my bed for eating crackers.
Why else would she be there?
Yeah, that's very humorous, Normie.
Yeah, in light of the fact that a leading woman's magazine just recently completed a survey which showed that postmen are the most desired lovers right after-- Rock stars and heart surgeons.
Well, you know what they say down at the P.O "Postmen deliver daily".
Have we had this conversation before, Norm?
Cliffie, we've had every conversation before.
Boy, when people start finishing each other's sentences, they're-- Spending far too much time together.
Say, Woody, let me have another beer there.
Hey, did you hear the one about the--?
Shepherd and the parrot?
Yeah.
That was a good one.
- I had a very nice time, Brian.
- Me too.
Well, well, if it isn't Kitten With a Whip.
That's funny.
Sam, I'd like you to meet Brian.
Brian, this is Sam.
And?
Oh, this is, yeah, April.
April, that's Brian.
Hi.
- And I'm obviously, I guess, Diane.
- Oh, right, yeah.
- So you two have a good time?
- Oh, very nice.
Very nice time.
- Yeah, we had a great time.
- Yeah, we had a fabulous time.
It was just a movie and a burger afterwards.
Oh, but what a film.
And the ground beef was excellent, very lean.
Listen, I wanna thank you for giving me a ride home.
That's a great car you've got there.
Yes, Brian has a wonderful car too, and it gets excellent mileage.
What kind of mileage you get?
Thirty-five on the highway, Thirty-two and 24.
Sorry.
Well, thanks again.
Good night.
What a putrid display.
You know, people come here to relax and enjoy themselves.
They don't wanna look at that.
Do you?
Yeah!
This is sick.
Brian has a big-screen TV.
- April has a satellite dish.
- You are so childish.
Excuse me, are you the owner?
Yeah, that's right, Sam Malone.
Hi.
Phil Schumacher, campaign manager for Janet Eldridge.
She's running for re-election to city council.
Listen, the councillor is just down the street on a walking tour of the district.
Would it be all right if she came in to meet the folks, and perhaps answer some questions for the newspaper reporters?
- Sure.
Why not?
- Great.
Thanks a lot, Sam.
Hey, how about that?
We're a stop on the old campaign trail.
Oh, Sam.
You're so politically naive.
Janet Eldridge is an old-money conservative who consistently supports big-business interests over badly-needed social programs.
She's a real political opportunist.
Well, if she's that bad, I'll have her out of here in a flash.
Ladies and gentlemen, Councillor Janet Eldridge.
She's got until Christmas, then she's out of here.
I could use your support in the upcoming election.
Yeah, right.
You got fame, money, power and looks.
- What you need, I ain't got.
- I need your vote.
I need a man.
But you don't see me going around bars begging for one.
I give.
I know when I'm overmatched.
I'm glad I'm not running against you.
She's smooth.
I'll give her that.
Sam, I'd like you to meet Councillor Eldridge.
Councillor, this is-- "Mayday" Malone needs no introduction to me or anyone else in this town.
I was a big fan when you pitched for the Sox.
I think you're just wonderful.
Well, it's mutual.
- Oh, you're a fan of the councillor's?
- No, I think I'm wonderful too.
Hey, hey, hey, Sammy.
Unless these tired old eyes are deceiving me, pal, there's something going on between you and the councillor.
I don't think so.
No, no, no.
Watching that woman work this room has brought me to a decision.
You've decided to work it too for a change?
I'm going to campaign for Janet Eldridge's opponent - in the coming election.
- Is that right?
I've voted for him before, but he really needs my help now.
Would anyone like to join me in this campaign?
Working side by side untiringly to carry James Fleener to victory?
I would.
James Fleener is the finest man to enter public life in the last decade.
I'd be honoured to work for him.
All right.
He needs all the help he can get.
Who the hell is James Fleener?
- Boy, oh, boy, is Miss Eldridge pretty.
- Yeah.
You know, back home in Hanover, everybody on the town council has a paunch and smokes big, smelly cigars.
Don't you have any women on the town council there?
Yeah.
Sammy, I've been noticing she just can't take her eyes off you.
- You gonna ask her out?
- What are you talking about?
Well, look at her.
She's a good woman, Sam.
She deserves it.
I don't know.
Yeah, politics makes strange bedfellows, Sam.
So do you and anyone or anything.
I guess she's a little out of your league when you come right down to it, huh?
Yeah, what's the matter, Sam?
She too much for you?
I just don't think it's a good idea to hop into bed with someone who could raise my taxes.
Councillor Eldridge will take a few questions now.
Jerry Baker, Boston Star.
Councillor, do you support the effort of the so-called Grant Avenue Coalition to overturn the city council's rezoning of that neighbourhood for commercial use?
I voted in favour of rezoning and would do so again.
My reasons are a matter of public record.
No, I do not support them.
Clifford C. Clavin, U.S. Postal Service, South Central Branch.
In view of the carnage taking place in our postal routes, are you in favour of beefing up our leash laws to include Iife imprisonment for the canine offenders?
I think that's a bit drastic, but I am in favour of doing all we can to support our overworked and underpaid postal carriers.
You do a wonderful job.
That woman has got my support, and I will deliver you the postal vote.
Too bad it'll be to the wrong address.
My name is Diane Chambers, and I have a question.
- Do you work here?
- How come no one ever knows that?
Yes, I'm a waitress and proud of it.
In a work-ethic kind of way.
Councillor, you have been accused of being out of touch with your constituency.
Do you expect this stroll through the neighbourhood to make up for four years of neglect?
- Hold on just-- - It's all right.
Miss Chambers, I represent every one of the people in my district.
If I don't get out and talk as often as I'd like, it's because I'm in my office or at council meetings or in conference with civic and business leaders 1 6 hours a day.
I've never missed a vote in my four years on the council, and if I'm elected again I intend to work even harder for the people I am privileged to represent.
Good, Diane, you got her on the ropes.
Tom Edwards, Boston Sentinel.
Oh, excuse me, I think this gentleman had his hand up first.
Yeah, I'm not a reporter, I'm just a voter.
But I have a very important question.
Do you like Chinese food, and if so, have you ever eaten it in the bathtub?
Yes, and no comment.
Well, in that case I have a follow-up question here.
What are you doing for dinner Thursday night?
The offer is very tempting, Mr Malone, but I will have to respectfully decline.
- The campaign keeps me very busy.
- I understand.
What I won't give up for the people of this district.
- Thank you all, ladies and gentlemen.
- Thank you very much.
Look at that, Norm.
She shot Sammy down.
Impeachment proceedings should begin immediately.
She may be out of touch with the common man, but she can sure spot a common roach.
- Sam?
- Yeah?
This is Janet's private number.
She wants you to call her.
- Guys, Janet's private number here.
- All right!
Sammy!
Sammy!
Sammy!
Fleener!
Fleener!
Fleener!
Okay.
Fleener!
- Sammy!
Sammy!
- Fleener!
Fleener!
Say, Diane did you happen to hear that Sam is going out with Councillor Eldridge again tonight?
I believe I heard something like that.
Did you know it was for dinner at the governor's mansion?
I recall someone mentioning it.
Did they also mention that they were going in a limousine?
- A limo?
- Not a limo.
A limousine.
So, what are you doing tonight, Diane?
Frasier and I are going canvassing for Jim Fleener in the neighbourhood, and then we're stuffing mailers into envelopes later on.
Well, that sounds like fun too.
- Evening, everybody.
- Norm!
- Norman.
- What's happening, Mr Peterson?
The question is, Woody, why is it happening to me?
Well, you're a little late there, Normie.
Where you been?
Well, I was at Hurley's Market.
I took Vera out for a little grocery shopping, then a little dinner.
Oh, gee, that's nice, Mr P. Where did you go to dinner?
Hurley's Market.
They were giving out those little sausage samples on toothpicks.
By the way, guys, for your information, a dozen appears to be the cut-off number.
Say, did you hear that I'm going to the governor's place tonight for dinner?
Yes.
There was a rumour in the air.
Back when there was air.
You got a second here?
Listen you know that ice cream stuff they serve in the middle of dinner there?
- Is it okay--?
- Sorbet.
Sorbet, right, sorbet.
Is it okay if I were to ask for chocolate sauce with that?
- I think it's wise not to.
- All right, all right.
And for God's sake, remember that a bowl of warm water - with a slice of lemon in it-- - I know, I know.
It's a finger bowl, it's not lemon soup.
You know, nobody would've known that time if you hadn't screamed.
You certainly have been at the councillor's beck and call lately.
I never thought I'd see you so controlled by a woman.
What happened to the Sam Malone who once said to me, "Hey, we're gonna do what I wanna do from now on"?
You left him in a restaurant with a face full of fettuccini.
That doesn't mean I didn't like him.
"Wim with Jim"?
I thought it up.
It's very Joycean.
If that means stupid, I agree.
Frasier, put the box in the back, please.
If you're looking for something to do, you can start stuffing the envelopes.
I've been stuffing all day, Diane.
Frankly, the task has lost its considerable power to charm me.
Frasier, that's a defeatist attitude.
We don't need quitters on the Fleener team.
- Hey, Sam, you're on TV.
- Oh, yeah, look at that.
- Nice-looking threads, Sam.
- Yeah.
Janet picked out the suit.
She really knows what looks good on the tube.
Carla, even though we have our differences, and we're frequently at odds, there's one thing we very much have in common: We both like Sam.
And I'm concerned about him.
I think he might get hurt by this liaison with Janet Eldridge.
Yeah, you're right.
He's having a lot of laughs and a hot time with a beautiful woman.
The man is a glutton for punishment.
This is no romp, Carla.
It's more serious than that.
And the worst part is that she's just using him.
I mean, it all adds up.
He's an outstanding sports figure, he's attractive, and in this town it doesn't hurt that he's lrish.
- He's a vote getter.
- So what?
So when the election's over, it's "So long, Sam".
And I think he's really going to be hurt by this.
That's "so what".
You are full of beans.
Women come and women go in Sam's life.
He's just having a few grins, and I can prove it.
Hey, a word over here, heartthrob.
Coming at you.
Cliffie, Cliffie.
I got this one.
You know, Sammy, I've been thinking.
You have got a great set-up with this Eldridge babe.
You're going to all these high-toned parties, meeting a lot of fancy people, driving around in big cars.
And the best thing is, you are getting to do to a politician what they've been doing to us for years.
You know, Carla, sometimes you got a lousy sense of humour.
Sorry.
"A few grins," Carla?
- Boy, you look fabulous.
- Thank you.
So do you.
Well, thank you.
Listen, I am famished here.
Do you know what kind of sorbet they're serving?
- No, I was curious about that myself.
- Well-- Before we go I have to make a couple of phone calls.
- May I use your office?
- Yeah.
Right under the whale there.
Look at the size of that limo.
Hey, Your Excellence?
- Does it have a TV?
- Yes, it does.
Go and take a look at it if you want.
Oh, hot dog!
- Oh, boy, the exuberance of youth.
- Yeah.
Wide-eyed and innocent.
Well, I guess those days are long gone for you and me.
Yeah, yeah.
Thanks, Edith.
Yeah, I'll talk to you tomorrow.
Bye-bye.
I'm sorry to interrupt, Councillor Eldridge.
Please, call me Janet.
What can I do for you?
It's Diane, isn't it?
Yes.
I'm speaking on behalf of everyone here at Cheers, and I would just like to say that we're all very fond of Sam.
And, frankly, we're a little worried about him.
We wouldn't like to see him get hurt.
What are you getting at?
Janet, I've made no secret of my opposition to you politically, but let's retract our claws for the moment, shall we?
Let's stop hissing at each other.
Do you have a problem with cats?
No.
But it's the consensus of opinion around here that you're using Sam to get re-elected, with total disregard for his feelings, and we don't think that's a very nice thing to do.
I see.
Well, I'll be honest with you, Diane.
That's exactly why I started seeing him.
So l-- We were right.
Well, I'm warning you, I have some influence with Sam.
Yes, I know.
He thinks a great deal of you.
Anytime I wanted to-- He said that?
Yes.
He mentions you often.
And Sam is a man of few words.
Well, he only knows a few.
Yes.
He is a simple man in many ways, but I think that's his strength.
I mean, I never met anyone who didn't like him.
Well, good.
But I don't understand why we're standing here chatting so enjoyably when you just admitted that you're using Sam.
That's not what I said, Diane.
You didn't let me finish.
Please.
Well, when I first started seeing Sam, perhaps I had ulterior motives in mind, but my attitude toward him has changed dramatically.
I've learned that Sam has something that's pretty special.
I've never experienced with any other man the feeling I have when I'm with him.
When we're at a fundraiser or something like that, I'll watch him across the room talking with some people, and sometimes a feeling comes over me so strong that it nearly makes me ache.
Oh, God.
I sound like a silly schoolgirl.
That's the truth.
Does that make you feel better?
It certainly does.
I'm awfully glad we put this matter to rest.
You like Sam.
And Sam likes you.
No one's going to get hurt.
Well, "wack to berk".
Boy, you're really good.
You almost had me fooled there.
But I don't believe a word you said.
When this campaign is over, Sam's going to last about as long as your campaign promises.
Well, back to work.
And I would like to thank each and every one of you.
- This is a victory for all of us.
- Yes!
Well, not quite all of us.
I guess that's about-- I guess that's about it.
Thanks.
Thanks, Diane, for all your help.
Nobody ever worked harder for me than you.
In fact, I think you worked harder than I did.
You did your best.
That's all that matters.
Say, listen, did you know you're out of liquor?
And now I would like to bring up a man without whom I would not be standing here tonight.
- Sam?
- Yeah?
- Would you let Phil through, please?
- Oh, yeah.
My campaign manager, Mr Phil Schumacher!
And this guy has been such a tremendous help to me in this campaign.
I'm sure he needs no introduction.
But for those ladies in the audience who would like an introduction, you're not gonna get one.
That was my last chance.
Looks like I blew it.
Me too.
{END OF EPISODE 24}{START OF EPISODE 25}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
I'm sorry I'm late.
Oh, hey, I bet you can't guess who I met at Janet's house last night.
- Sam, please.
- What?
This is really getting out of hand.
In the month that you've been dating the lovely Councillor Eldridge you've done nothing but drop names.
You'd think you'd never seen a celebrity before.
So spare me your stargazing.
Hey, hey, Gary Hart.
- Gary Hart, there he is.
- Oh, hey, senator.
Hi, Sam, you left your coat in my car last night.
That's sweet of you to bring it by.
Thank you.
Least I could do for a Trivial Pursuit partner.
By the way, thanks for your help with those sports questions.
Well, that's my strong point.
Thank you for helping me with everything else.
- That's my strong point.
- Yeah.
Gary.
What say you park her down here, and I'll buy you a brewski, eh?
Thanks.
I think I'll take a rain check.
Oh, well, in that case you can buy me one.
Just kidding, you know.
Sort of.
- Sam, I better run.
Thanks.
- Yeah.
- Good to see you again.
- Thank you.
Thanks for dropping by.
Oh, my God, it's Gary Hart.
Did you see Gary Hart?
I saw Gary Hart.
Senator Gary Hart.
Could have been President Gary Hart.
Could still be President Gary Hart.
Gary Hart, that's Gary I was just showing you how silly it looks.
Please, don't do it again.
Frasier, it was awfully nice of you to invite me out for a drink.
Oh, well, it's my pleasure, Jim.
I just couldn't bear to see you so down in the dumps after you lost the election.
I thought this might cheer you up.
I'm sure it will.
Woody Iet me get a Scotch on the rocks.
- Oh, well, make that two.
- Coming right up.
Say, aren't you that guy that Janet Eldridge whipped in the election?
- Woody.
- Oh, oh, I'm sorry.
I guess you just look like him.
Did that Fleener guy take a shellacking or what?
All right.
Jim, you have to look on the bright side of this.
Yeah.
Well, for example, what were the positive things about your campaign?
Well Well, of course, there was Diane.
Diane?
She was wonderful.
She was absolutely wonderful.
You know, a man could go far with a woman like that at his side.
In fact, now that the campaign is over, I thought I might ask her out.
Well, I think that's wonderfully open-minded of you, considering her operation.
What operation was that?
Well, she had a sex-change operation.
Surely you knew.
Sex change?
No, l, l-- Diane?
Hi, Frasier.
- Jim, what are you doing here?
- Diane, Diane, what a courageous person you are.
- What are you talking about?
- What a wonderful job they did.
I, l-- Of course, now that I know, I can tell the difference.
Well, I think I'm gonna be going now.
Bye, Diane.
It's great to see old Jimbo again, isn't it?
Frasier, have you been telling people I had a sex-change operation again?
No.
He guessed.
Why, thank you, gentlemen.
Well, you look nice too, Miss Eldridge.
Sam, we didn't expect to see you here today.
Well, Janet wanted me to change my tie.
Why don't you sit here.
I think the black one's under the bar.
I just wore this as a kind of gag anyway.
Good one.
Do you?
Do you want a white wine?
- I'd love it.
- Fine.
Woody, would you do that?
- And a club soda for myself.
- Sure, Sam.
- Hello, Sam.
- Oh, hi.
- My, going formal again.
- Yeah.
You've logged a lot of hours in the tuxedo lately.
Kind of getting used to the old monkey suit.
You know, I never realized until now just how appropriate that nickname is.
That's very funny.
My, aren't we a grumpy primate?
She's jealous you're going to a party at the mayor's house, and she's not.
As a matter of fact, I have a wonderful evening planned.
My date Gregory and l are going to the theatre and then to a late-night supper and dancing.
Boy, does that bring back memories.
Oh, are you recalling a similar evening, Woody?
No, I just remembered your date called and cancelled.
He said that he had to go on duty at the hospital, and that he was really very sorry.
Oh, I'm sorry too, sweetheart.
Well, it's okay.
Really.
It's not like I went out and spent $31 2 on a new dress.
Then you'd really feel dumb.
- Evening, everybody.
- Hey, Norm!
What's going down, Mr Peterson?
My cheeks on this barstool.
What's the problem there, Norm?
Trouble, Cliffie, with a capital D. Vera's younger sister, Donna, is coming to visit.
She insists on prancing around the house wearing next to nothing.
She's always exercising in front of me in skimpy little leotards and stuff.
She'll shower with the door half open, right in front of me.
I see your problem here.
Sounds like you got a case of the frustrated female over there.
I know just what to do.
We'll try a little Acu-Clavin on her.
- Let me go get the car.
- Thank you for changing, Sam.
I mean, it did say on the invitation, black tie.
Leash optional.
Well, Diane.
The election is long over and you must be tremendously relieved.
- About what?
- Remember, you were so concerned I was going to abandon Sam after he'd served my political purposes.
Obviously you were wrong about Sam and l. - Wrong about Sam and me.
- That too.
Excuse me.
Sam's waiting.
I'd love to belt you.
Welcome to the losers' club, baby.
Now that you've paid your dues, here's your membership card.
Yeah, we're a pair, aren't we?
A couple of chumps that life just kicked in the teeth, and why am l talking like Broderick Crawford?
Frasier, I know you think I'm jealous of Janet and Sam's relationship, but I'm not.
I just don't want to see him get hurt.
That's really all there is to it.
I think you're kidding yourself, Diane.
We both know the reason you've been down in the dumps.
But believe me, there's no need to be.
Sam is not really happy with that woman.
Imagine the mental strain it must be trying to use the right fork all the time.
Don't give up hope.
I haven't.
You're a lovely man.
I'm sorry I hurt you.
I wish there was some way I could make you forgive me.
Well, marry me.
Bear my children.
Let me die in your arms.
I was thinking more along the lines of making fudge.
Well, I like your fudge.
- Hey, Diane, I'm leaving.
- Okay.
I'm gonna shut off the light and lock you in.
- Okay.
- Don't forget to cover the pool table.
- Okay.
- Make sure you pull your arms off - and stuff them down your throat.
- Okay.
What did?
I'm sorry, honey.
Let me just check and make sure Woody remembered.
Go ahead.
I know it's had you preoccupied.
You hardly slept a wink during the mayor's entire speech.
Oh, darn it, Woody.
I knew he'd forget.
He forgot to leave the check for the beer man.
Or did I forget to tell him?
No, no, no, he forgot to remind me to tell him.
- That's what it was.
- Did you have a good time tonight?
I had a great time.
- That was nice.
- Yeah, nice in a great sort of way.
By the way, wasn't it funny running into one of your old girlfriends - working for the caterer tonight?
- Was that weird?
- What are the odds on that?
- Pretty good, I'd say.
We run into your girlfriends all over town.
I'd like to point out that we didn't see one in the limo on the way home.
What's the longest relationship you've ever had, Sam?
Oh, let's see.
I went out with one person there for a whole year.
- Mind if I ask who she was?
- No, not at all.
Any time.
Oh, right, you're asking now.
Well, all right.
You're not gonna believe this.
Nobody did.
I mean, I even have trouble believing it.
It was Diane.
Unbelievable, huh?
No, actually it explains quite a few things.
Well, that's That's Diane for you.
Unbelievable and explaining things.
But anyway, that's all over now.
Since things are over between you and Diane, - I wonder why she still works here.
- Why, she's gotta work someplace.
Does she owe you money she's trying to work off?
No.
Would you lose customers if she leaves?
No.
As a matter of fact, I'd probably get a few back if I did let her go.
Sam, nobody said anything about letting her go, but, as a matter of fact, you might be doing her a favour.
Unless, of course, there are still feelings left between you two that I should know about.
Don't be silly.
Of course not.
I'm glad to hear that.
You know how much I care for you.
What are we doing here?
Let's go home.
Listen, don't worry about that.
Diane is probably staying here because she thinks that I can't do without her.
- Sam?
- Yeah?
Do you really think that talented, bright, lovely woman belongs in a bar serving drinks?
I guess not.
I mean, no, of course not.
Maybe she just needs a friendly shove out of the nest.
I hadn't thought about that before, in that way.
The sooner you do it, the sooner she'll be out of this dead-end job and on to something a lot more meaningful in her life.
- Yeah, I guess so.
- Oh, Sam, what am I doing?
I'm not being honest.
The truth is I'm just not comfortable with Diane working here.
I mean, you've had a past with her.
And I'm as insecure as anybody.
Are you saying that you think I should fire her?
Sam, it's not my business.
And I'm not trying to interfere.
But if I were you, I'd do it right away.
Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?
- Yes.
Why not?
Yeah, why not?
I mean, tomorrow is as good as any time, I guess.
Hey, Carla?
Carla, is Diane here yet?
No, Diane is not here yet.
That is the third time you've asked me that.
Why would you, or anyone for that matter, want to see her?
Well Just curious.
No reason.
Well, when she gets here, I'll make an announcement, okay?
What's your problem?
Carla has it ever occurred to you that Diane doesn't really belong here?
You mean this bar or this planet?
Either way, it's yes.
Sometimes I think this place just isn't good enough for somebody like her, you know?
I mean, she's a cocktail waitress.
That's a dead-end job.
There's no future, no reward.
She, she's-- She's a junior cocktail waitress.
You are a senior cocktail waitress.
There's a big difference.
Listen, Sam, I know what this is all about.
You're not really that serious about this Eldridge babe, are you?
To tell you the truth, I don't know how serious I am.
But I do know that I'm having the best time of my life.
And as you know, my life has been wall-to-wall fun.
She's smart, but at the same time she doesn't make me feel not smart.
I feel important when I'm around her.
I like that.
- Oh, puke.
- What?
Will you cut it out?
I mean, that is the sappiest junk I've ever heard.
Look, you've proven your point.
You can go out with classy dames like her.
You can go out with anybody.
Now, you've had your fun.
I want you to just quit fooling around, march right out there, and find yourself an airhead with big casabas.
What the heck has gotten into you, Carla?
Sammy, it's just not right.
You are not a one-woman guy.
I mean, it's like the time of your great sickness.
- When I went out with Diane.
- That's right.
You're starting to get me worried.
No, no, no, you're nuts.
You're nuts, Carla.
When Diane gets here, say something.
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!
Hey, Mr Peterson.
Can I pour you a beer?
Well, okay, Woody, but be sure to stop me at one.
Make that 1 :30.
So, Normie, did Vera's sister, Donna, show?
Yeah, she showed all right, Cliff.
She showed plenty.
Well, don't tell me she's still prancing around in her Skivvies, eh.
All right, listen to this.
I have to go to the room to get something, right?
So I knock.
Once, twice, no answer.
So in I go, right?
There she is, sitting on the bed, doing her nails, buck-naked.
Buck?
Totally buck.
She tried to cover herself up, but believe me, an emery board doesn't hide much.
My nerves are just frazzled.
I don't know what I should do, Cliffie.
Well, I've got you covered here, Normie.
You need to relax.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's it.
Relax.
- Right.
- Yeah, see, why don't you and l go over to your house and watch some tube, eh?
Cheers.
Oh, just a minute.
It's for you, Mr Peterson.
Oh, hey, Miss Chambers.
Hello, Woody.
- Where's Sam?
- He's in his office.
- He's dying to see you.
- Do you have an envelope behind the bar, Woody?
Oh, Normie, you're as white as a sheet.
What's cooking?
Oh, that was Vera.
Her aunt's taken sick.
She has to go to Springfield for a few days.
That leaves me at home alone with Donna.
Just you and the siren.
Hey, Mr Peterson, maybe you can use that siren thing to scare off your sister-in-law.
- Hi, Diane.
- Hello, Frasier.
Oh, say, what--?
What's the matter with you?
Sam thinks he's going to fire me.
But I have a little surprise for him.
- I'm resigning.
- You're leaving Cheers?
- That's right.
- Well, great.
You can work for me.
I need a new receptionist.
Frasier, you have a wonderful receptionist.
Mrs McGrady has worked for you and your family for 20 years.
Well, yes, but I caught her in a typo the other day, so she's history.
- Thank you, Frasier.
I don't think so.
- Okay, but one word from you and that blue-haired head rolls.
Is she here yet?
Oh, good, good.
You're just the person I wanna see.
Sweetheart, you are far too bright, talented and lovely to waste your-- Before you go any further, read this.
All right.
Well, does this--?
Does this mean you're quitting?
Isn't that what it clearly states on page five?
But why?
I mean, I don't understand why.
My reasons are enumerated here above the graph.
Oh.
Oh, well, this-- This is great.
I mean, it's not great.
It's awful.
But I mean it's, well, it's great for you.
Don't you think?
I mean, it's probably best for everybody in the long run.
Personally, I feel awful about this.
I know what you were going to do.
You were going to fire me.
What makes you say that?
Let's just say a woman knows.
You were going to fire me.
And what have I done?
I've made it easier for you.
People have always made things easier for you.
Well, I'm not going to let you off the hook.
I withdraw my resignation.
Fire me, if you can.
But I don't think you have the guts.
After all we've gone through, the good times and the bad, I say you don't have the courage to fire me to my face.
- You're fired.
- Too late.
I resign.
No, you can't do that.
No, you took back your resignation and you dared me to fire you.
No, you can't do that.
You're fired.
I did it.
The last time we had an official parting of the ways there was some question as to who left whom.
That is why this time I've gone to the trouble of tendering my resignation in the written form.
Legal precedent states that the written document always supersedes the spoken word, especially when it's spoken by a goof.
Oh, fine.
Fine.
Who cares?
See you in the funny papers.
Oh, that's perfect.
The funny papers.
Don't say another word.
Let that be the last utterance I remember.
And now I'm off to begin a new life.
- I shall forget you in a trice.
- Oh, a trice?
Please, let that be the last word I hear from you.
You troglodyte.
That's even better!
Attention, everyone.
May I have your attention, please?
I have resigned.
I know this comes as a shock, but I've decided that I no longer fit into the scheme of things around here.
I go willingly with a gladful heart, for it has been my pleasure to serve you, and my privilege to know you, lo, these many years.
I shall miss you all.
But weep no tears for Diane Chambers.
She's tougher than you think.
She's going to be okay.
You bet she is.
So this is goodbye.
For there's one thing I know: You will never, ever see me again.
Farewell.
Hey, look, everyone.
It's Diane.
{END OF EPISODE 25}{START OF EPISODE 26}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
You sending another recorded message home to the folks, Wood?
Oh, yeah.
lt's a lot cheaper than a phone call.
Hi, folks.
This is your son, Woody Boyd.
But enough about me.
You know, things have been getting really crazy around Cheers lately.
Remember l told you that Sam was going out with this real pretty politician lady named Janet Eldridge?
Well, things are still going hot and heavy.
Oh, Miss Chambers quit.
Yeah, l think this stuff between Sam and Miss Eldridge finally got to her.
Anyway, she says she's never coming back in here again.
Gee, l'm gonna miss her.
Well, that's it.
Bye.
Let's hear how it sounds.
We shall fight on the seas and the oceans.
We shall fight in growing confidence and growing strength in the air.
You know, l guess it's true.
You listen to the sound of your own voice, it always sounds different.
Afternoon, everybody.
Norm!
How you feeling today, Mr Peterson?
- Poor.
- Oh, l'm sorry to hear that.
No, l meant, pour.
- Trouble in paradise, Norm?
- No, at home, Cliffie.
l just put Vera on the train to Springfield.
l have to spend the next few days at home alone with her oversexed, exhibitionist sister, Donna.
Maybe she's an innocent kid, and you misinterpret her friendliness.
Maybe you're right.
You tell me, is it normal for a girl to get dressed on the front lawn?
Hey, hey.
Didn't you see the sign outside?
We reserve the right to refuse service to skinny ex-waitresses with bad dye jobs.
Oh, Carla, couldn't we make an exception just this once?
Thanks, Woody.
But l'm not here for the potables.
l'm here to see Sam.
He should be down in a few minutes.
He's at Melville's with Miss Eldridge.
She's telling him what to say and what not to say at the press conference today.
Oh, there's a press conference?
Yeah, and it's gonna be right here in the bar.
Oh, that's quite unorthodox.
No, l think it's open to all faiths.
l'll have a seltzer, please.
Hey, whitey.
About that dye job crack l'm sorry.
You're sorry?
l don't think l've heard you say that before.
Thanks, Woody.
Yeah, l know.
But l figure it's about time.
l mean, now that you're Boston's number-one loser, l'm feeling kind of different about you.
l'm flattered.
ln fact l wanna apologize for all the crummy things l've said to you over the years.
Why, thank you, Carla.
Except for that one about your lizard lips.
- l like that one.
- Exception noted.
And you know, the one about you having a personality you could store meat in.
l'd like to keep that one alive too.
This is so like you.
Covering up what are obviously some very fine, warm feelings.
But l happen to know what you're really saying is you like me.
You're touching me.
- lt's called communication.
- No, it's called a death wish.
Hey, Diane, l understand you're hitting the bricks in Unemployment City there along with Normie.
Oh, actually, l've found other employment.
Oh, yeah?
See that, Norm?
What's the job that you landed there?
Well it's only temporary until l hear about this other job.
ln fact, it's so temporary l don't even bother to take my coat off when l'm there, if you get my point.
l'm a checkout clerk at Hurley's Market.
What?
A checkout clerk at Hurley's Market.
Are you deaf?
Hey, Diane, that's where l shop.
Next time l come in, l'll say hi.
lf you don't, l'll be angry.
Well, excuse me, l have to make a call about that other job.
l'm sure Sam won't mind me using his office.
Cheers.
Oh, just a minute, please.
lt's for you, Mr Peterson.
Hello.
- Oh, hi, Donna.
- Hey.
Donna.
Yeah.
Yeah, l don't know.
Usual time, l guess.
Fine, yeah.
No, it sounds great.
Okay.
- What did she want, Norm?
- ''What did she want, Norm?
'' What she wanted was, she wanted me to come home early.
She's making a turkey dinner, all right?
And then she paused and said there'd be no dressing.
Do you suppose she meant the bird or us?
Either way, there's gonna be some plump, succulent thighs at that table.
- Hi, Miss Chambers.
- Hi, Woody.
- l thought you left.
- No, no, l'm waiting for Sam.
l have a call to make.
Well, he's up in the restaurant.
l can go get him if you want.
l mean, he's probably just eating or something.
No, that's okay.
Thank you.
l have calls to make.
Actually, Woody, l'm not really in here to make phone calls.
l came back to apologize to Sam.
l loathe to admit that l eavesdropped on a conversation he had with Janet the other day, and that's inexcusable.
My conscience was bothering me, so l came back to confess.
Thus allowing me to close this chapter in my life.
Okey-dokey.
Woody?
Woody?
May l ask you a question?
Sure, if you're not fussy about the answer.
Has Sam ever talked to you about his feelings toward Miss Eldridge?
Well l heard him say that he kind of likes her.
But in my opinion, you and Sam make a much better couple.
- Really?
- Yeah.
You're my two favourite people in the whole world.
Oh, Woody.
Thank you.
Except for my parents.
- l know.
- And my teachers at school.
Oh, wait a minute.
l can put you ahead of my 8th grade teacher, Mr Thorndike.
He always had chalk on his suit and he smelled kind of funny.
But, you know, l don't wanna hurt Mr Thorndike's feelings, so let's just forget this conversation.
l was planning to, Woody.
- Hey, Sam.
- Hey, Woody.
Could we go into your office?
l need to talk to you about a personal matter.
Sam, this is serious.
So is this.
We have this press conference today, and l just want you to know that it's becoming increasingly difficult for me to answer questions - about what our future plans are.
- Why?
Because l don't know what our future plans are.
Wait, wait, what are you saying?
Well, this may sound a little old-fashioned, but l guess l'm asking what your intentions are toward me.
lntentions?
Well, l mean, haven't you ever thought about you and me tying the knot?
Oh, now, you told me you didn't go in for that kinky stuff.
Okay.
All right, all right.
Well, do you?
You see, you see You and l really have never even talked about, you know-- - The word is marriage, Sam.
- Yeah.
lt won't bite you.
Reporters are bound to ask about us at the press conference today.
l don't know what we're gonna tell them.
Do you?
Well gee, l-- l don't-- - l don't know that-- - Oh, take it easy, Sam.
- What?
- l'm not trying to trap you.
Oh, are you kidding?
l don't feel trapped.
Excuse me.
Let me, let me just l'm not putting any pressure on you, darling.
l know a man like you hates that kind of thing from a woman.
lt's just in my profession, l have to take things seriously because l'm in the public eye.
lt'd be different if l worked in a supermarket or something.
All l'm saying is that it's something we have to think about.
We can't go on indefinitely like we have been.
Not that l have any complaints about what we have been.
Okay, l'll give it some thought.
l will.
l promise.
Good.
l'll see you later.
Okay.
- Sam?
- Yeah, what?
l just wanted to remind you again.
When are you gonna replace Miss Chambers?
- You haven't put an ad in the paper.
- l'll get to it, Woody.
Well, you keep saying that.
- Would you stop bugging me, please?
- Okay, Sam.
Sorry.
By the way where is Miss Chambers?
Hey, how should l know where she is, Wood?
Give me a break, will you?
She came in here to wait.
- She what?
- Yeah.
Wait on tables here at Cheers, and you fired her.
And you know the rest.
Thank you for the recap, Woody.
Miss Chambers?
l covered for your eavesdropping this time, but you know, l think you have a real problem.
l think you ought to get some help.
l will, Woody.
l promise.
Do me one favour, will you?
Please, just tell me when Sam steps into the men's room.
Oh, God, it's worse than l imagined.
l can't believe this.
Cameras, reporters, government officials.
And to think, only a few short months ago, l was back in lndiana pumping suds for a bunch of bozos.
Hey, goober, how about pouring us another round?
Coming right up.
Hey, Woody, give us a couple of beers, will you?
- Hey, where you guys been?
- Normie took me to meet Donna, the alleged Lolita.
Yeah, maybe she's not quite as bad as l made her out to be.
Are you kidding?
She's the sweetest, most innocent freckle-faced youngster l ever wanted to meet.
And for you to imply she was unwholesome and behaved in a salacious manner towards you is unbelievable.
Well, maybe my imagination's a little overactive, l guess.
Especially if you think that that young lady is coming on to you.
She's coming on to me like gangbusters.
Cliffie, you know, you're really kind of a handy guy to have around.
Just when l think l've gone completely off the deep end, l look over at you, and there you are diving off the cliffs at Acapulco.
Yeah, but looking mucho primo in my bikini briefs, eh?
Excuse me.
Well, if it isn't Rebecca of Skinnybrook Farm.
Shouldn't you be out collecting shopping carts?
Well, l was in the neighbourhood, and l thought l'd drop by and unwind.
Sure.
lt just happens to be five minutes before Sam and Janet's press conference.
Oh, is that today?
Mercy.
Well, l'm a concerned citizen.
Perhaps l'll just stick around and see what happens.
Okay, l think we're ready now.
- Well, Sam, we're on.
- Wait a-- Wait a minute.
l don't know about this tie.
Come on.
When have you ever not looked fabulous?
Oh, yeah, right.
Right.
Shows you how nervous l am, huh?
- You'll be just fine.
- Yeah.
Thanks.
Good day, ladies and gentlemen.
We hold so many of our press conferences in my stuffy old office, l thought it would be nice to show you reporters what the inside of a bar looks like.
There won't be any opening statement today.
l'll just take your questions.
Councillor Eldridge, what's your priority in your next two years of office?
You must be new in town.
Mass transit.
l'll see to it that Boston has the finest system in this country or die trying.
Councillor, in view of your re-election to city council, l'd like to pose a question that l'm sure is on everybody's mind here today.
How do you think the Red Sox are gonna do this season?
Why don't l turn this over to my special consultant on this issue, Mayday Malone.
Whether the Red Sox do well or not is not the point.
l think they're gonna bring a lot of money into this city, and that can do nothing but help the tax base of our fair city.
ln layman's terms, the Sox are gonna clean up this year.
- l have a question.
- What?
What are you--?
Excuse me.
What paper do you represent?
Hurley's Market Shopper's Guide.
l'm afraid this is for newspaper reporters only.
Oh, l'm sorry.
l thought this was America.
No, no, Phil, it's okay.
- Hello again, Miss Chambers.
- Hello, and thank you.
Councillor, on the less political side, there seems to be a lot of interest in the two of you.
Mr Malone, would you care to comment on your plans for the future?
l thought we'd grab a pizza, then try to catch a movie on the tube later on.
How delightful.
But let me be a little more specific.
The hottest topic in town is whether or not there are wedding bells in Sam and Janet's future.
Can you confirm or deny these rumours?
Give us a scoop.
l'm sure there are more important issues to be discussed in this forum than that, Miss Chambers.
What do you have to say about this marriage business, Sam?
Oh, well, gee, l-- l don't know if-- l don't think this is the time or the place-- No, wait, wait.
Actually, l'll-- l will handle this.
Sweetheart.
Fellas, l think we're jumping the gun a little bit here.
l mean, we've only known each other about four months, so-- Really?
By my calculations, it's only six weeks.
Whatever.
Perhaps it just seems longer.
Next question, please.
Councillor, do you agree with Mr Malone that the relationship seems to be dragging on?
Yeah, l-- l know what you're trying to do here, Diane.
How dumb do you think l am?
l believe we're supposed to ask the questions.
Janet, how dumb do you think Sam is?
Could we please confine our questions to matters of public interest, please?
Councillor, how do you plan to alleviate the overnight parking problem?
The overnight parking problem, unfortunately, cannot be solved overnight.
l have, however, persuaded the city council to hasten the formation of a fact-finding committee for the purpose of looking into selecting sites.
Of course, there are problems to contend with, such as environmental-impact studies and reports.
Stop it!
All right, that's it!
You see that?
She just squirted me!
- She has a little yellow squirt-- - Will you stop this?
Yeah, all right.
l'll stop it.
l'm all right.
Yeah, l'm gonna escort this woman out of my bar forever.
Very well.
l'll leave.
And l never want to see your fat, ugly face again.
- You're about to see my fat, ugly fist.
- l'm shaking in my boots.
- My tie.
- Going up.
l believe the gentleman from The Globe had a question.
Well, l certainly have to hand it to you, Sammy.
You throw one helluva press conference.
l haven't seen such an ugly scene since my kids' school picture.
l just got off the phone with the last newspaper.
l'm not sure how much damage was done.
What'd you say?
l told them you took some sinus medication and had an allergic reaction.
- They buy it?
- Not unless there's something else you can put in a crock.
Oh, come on.
l know it was a bit unpleasant earlier tonight, but, l mean, when you look back on it, you can't help but laugh.
Unless you try really hard.
Oh, come on.
Now, there's a grin in there.
Come on.
Now, that'll turn into a smile.
All right, there you go.
Come on, l'm sorry.
How the hell did l ever get into this mess?
l'm crazy about a guy who's the worst thing in the world for me.
We can't go on like this, Sam.
You have no regard for my career.
And what's worse, you have no regard for me.
You lied when you said you had no feelings for Diane.
- You obviously have strong feelings.
- No, no, come on, please.
That-- No, Sam, face it.
You're trying to leave every option open, and you just can't do that.
You have to make some choices and some commitments.
lt's called growing up.
Boy, looks like Sammy got his walking papers.
l know how he feels.
l think we've all been there before.
Well, it's never happened to me, so l guess l'll just have to imagine it, huh?
Cliffie, l think you actually have to go with someone before you get dumped.
Good night.
Good night.
See you guys later.
Drive carefully.
Why don't we do this tomorrow, huh?
Let's go home.
No argument here.
l'm beat.
Boy, Sam, you had a rough day today.
You lost two great gals in one day.
Two?
Well, yeah, you know, l always thought that someday Miss Chambers would be Mrs Malone.
That's crazy, huh?
Well, Woody, there are more where they came from.
You know, l'm glad you said that because there's this girl in my building l wish you could meet.
She's really cute.
She's got a great personality.
She's really fun to be with, and she has got a gorgeous figure.
And if l were a young single guy in this town See you tomorrow, Sam.
- You okay?
- l don't know, Carla.
l think l screwed up my life here.
l mean, look at me.
l'm pushing 40, and what have l got to show for it?
Maybe it's time l settle down, huh?
Maybe the time's right for Mayday to get married.
The answer is yes.
You didn't ask a question, did you?
Listen, Sam, when the right dame comes along, you'll know it.
Well, that's what l'm afraid of.
l think she did, and l let her go.
No.
She didn't come along yet.
Casabas are your destiny, Sam.
Hold out.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Hi, it's-- lt's me.
Look l've been thinking about you.
Oh, what the hell.
Will you marry me?
