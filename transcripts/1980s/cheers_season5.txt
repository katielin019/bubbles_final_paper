{START OF EPISODE 1}
Hey, Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
Hi, it's me.
Li-listen, I've, uh I've been thinking about you and Oh, what the hell.
Will you marry me?
Sam?
Well, who else do you think it'd be?
Sam, if this is some kind of a joke  No, I'm serious.
Will you marry me?
Oh!
Oh, my God.
I'm I'm stunned.
I mean, it's-it's not like I never expected to hear this from you.
It's just that one is is never quite prepared for the question.
Oh, Sam, I'm touched.
I  All All at once, I I'm-I'm feeling giddiness, fear, euphoria, relief.
I-I don't know what to say.
Oh, that's okay.
I'm not listening anymore.
Sam, I-I-I I can't answer you now.
Not like this.
Every woman wants her proposal to be enchanting, something she can remember for the rest of her life.
Find something like that.
Keeping in mind I don't care for sports arenas, theme parks or miniature golf.
All right, young lady, you just prepare to be swept off your feet tomorrow night.
I already have been.
Bon soir, mon coeur.
R-Right, right.
Ugh.
I'll get another one.
Making your way in the world today Takes everything you've got Taking a break from all your worries Sure would help a lot Wouldn't you like to get away Sometimes you want to go Where everybody knows your name And they're always glad you came You want to be where you can see Our troubles are all the same You want to be where everybody knows your name You want to go where people know People are all the same You want to go where everybody knows your name.
Good afternoon, everybody.
Norm.
Hey, Mr. Peterson.
What's the story?
Boy meets beer.
Boy drinks beer.
Boy gets another beer.
Uh, boy, have I got an evening cooked up for us.
Yeah?
thanks for thinking of me, Cliffy, but, uh, I think I better get home early today.
What?
Yeah, Vera's getting home from Springfield, and I thought a special elegant meal would be the proper way to welcome her home, you know.
How thoughtful, Norm.
Say, what's on the menu?
Yeah, whatever she feels like whipping up after a five-hour bus trip.
Oh.
Hey Woody, didn't you say you'd been to this, uh, Le Petit Orange Restaurant?
Yeah.
Hey, Woody, you been to that, uh, fancy joint, eh?
Yeah, a couple of times.
Yeah?
Yeah, well, how was it?
Did they treat you well?
I didn't eat there.
I just went in to use the men's room.
Well, the-the restaurant part-- did it look like a a nice romantic place to take a lady?
Well, who could tell, Sam?
It's real dark in there, and they got this guy running around playing a violin.
Oh, no.
I bet they got those pictures of those guys that are half men, half horse, too, right?
I'm glad you said that, Sam.
I thought I was seeing things.
I've been racking my brains all day trying to find a place that's out of the ordinary and classy for dinner tonight.
How about a nude barbecue?
No.
It's kind of dangerous with all those sparks.
Oh, right.
Uh, well, what's the occasion there, Stretch?
Well, let's just Let's just say it's a special evening for a special lady.
Ooh!
Get out your scorecards, boys.
Sounds like Sammy's back in action.
Yeah!
Yeah!
I, uh, take it this means you've terminated your relationship with Councilor Eldridge.
Ooh, yeah, in-in the dumper.
Well, gentlemen, in memory of the Councilor, may I suggest we lower our cocktail napkins to half mast, huh?
Yes, let's not forget the traditional 21-peanut salute.
Oh, no.
Sammy, another round for the back?
Yeah, but I want to know who's the lucky lady tonight.
Yeah, come on, Sammy.
You'll-You'll find out soon enough.
Just come on, help me think of a place here.
Well, all right, Sam, I-I got something that might be just the ticket for you.
How about this?
A sailboat anchored offshore, you know, chilled champagne, candlelit dinner underneath the stars, huh?
Worked great for Sean and Madonna.
Where do you hear all this stupid stuff?
Let's just say inquiring minds want to know, huh.
A sailboat.
That's a good idea.
Maybe I'll call and see if I can rent one.
Hey, Sam, I just remembered something that might help you.
What's that?
Now my Uncle Wade was a master at putting women in a romantic mood.
Well, what-what'd he do?
Gave 'em money.
Worked like a charm.
Uh, thank you, Woody, but I'm looking for a place to take someone, a-a very special place.
As a matter of fact, come here.
Can you keep a secret?
Can I keep a secret?
You still don't know Carla leaves early on your night off, do you?
Good, good.
Listen, I'm only telling you this because I-I like you, and I and I trust you.
I'm thinking about proposing.
Oh, well, Sam, I'm flattered, but You probably don't mean me, huh?
We'll talk later.
Boy, oh, boy, I wouldn't mind being a barnacle on the rudder of Sam's sailboat, if you know what I mean.
I'm sure you'd be better-looking, but would you be happier?
Ooh.
Woody, are you in pain, buddy?
No, I was just thinking.
Yeah, well, the first time's always the worst.
Who do you think Sam's gonna propose to tonight?
What're you babbling about, Billy Bob Joe Jim?
Well, Sam said he was gonna propose to someone.
That's odd.
He said he broke up with Councilor Eldridge.
Who could he possibly be talking about proposing to?
You've chosen the most beautiful spot in which to anchor.
Everything's absolutely perfect.
This is the most wonderful idea any man ever came up with.
Who came up with it?
Come on, give me some credit.
I have an original thought now and then.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
Was it Frasier?
Actually, it was Cliff.
Well, okay then, don't tell me.
Right now I'm having a rather unoriginal thought.
Are you as happy as I?
Oh, yeah.
I just wish I could get this song out of my head.
Song?
Yeah.
You-You know how sometimes you connect certain places and things with certain songs?
Oh, I know exactly what you mean.
Thank you.
This may sound a bit pretentious, but every time I'm in a taxi, I can't help but hum "Dove Sono" from Le Nozze Di Figaro simply because once a rather zaftig Parisian cabbie sang the entire aria on a trip through Montparnasse to La Coupole.
Anyway, whenever I get out on the water like this, I can't help thinking about this tune.
Uh, Cappy Johnny, the old sailor who taught me how to sail used to whistle it all the time.
"Popeye the Sailor Man"?
You know it?
Oh, yes.
Well, that one haunts me, too.
May I propose a toast?
Indeed you may.
No, no, a, uh, shrimp toast.
A shrimp toast is even better.
Hmm.
To us.
How eloquent.
To us.
Boy, us.
Mm.
What a pair, huh?
The important thing is that this finally seems right.
Yeah.
I'm so happy about us.
I feel so good.
To think I almost let you get away because of Janet.
Well, you had some crazy notion you cared about her.
Well, hey, if it weren't for Janet, I wouldn't be here right now.
Which reminds me, I guess I better better get to why I came here in the first place.
Can you, uh, give me some room here?
Oh, oh, yes, indeed.
Mm.
Ha, ha!
You know, for the longest time, I kept pretending about you.
I guess I was afraid to really admit my feelings.
But from the very start, down deep inside, I have been crazy about you.
Crazier about you than any other woman I've ever met.
I mean, hell, I was crazy about you even when I hated you.
What I'm trying to say is will you marry me?
No.
No?
No.
Are you serious?
I'm afraid I am.
Well seems to me you have two choices.
One, I can throw you in, or two, you can jump in.
Sam, I warn you It's very simple.
One or two.
Sam, you haven't It's not open for debate, Diane.
Sam, I think after you've heard my explanation, you won't Sam, throw me a line, please?
!
Okay.
What's a nice girl like you doing in an ocean like this?
Sam!
What are you doing?
The dishes!
Sam calm down.
You're upset.
Only that I fished you out.
I know my answer was unexpected Unexpected.
No, no.
Don't be silly.
I brought you out here so I could be dumped with a nautical theme.
Sam if you'll stop that for a moment if you'll stop that for a moment, I'll try and explain my answer.
Are you done?
Maybe.
All right, then.
As it happens, I came out here with every intention of accepting your proposal but when you spoke of Janet, I had this enormous pang of doubt.
"What if wanting to get married "is a knee-jerk reaction to losing her?
Does he want me or just someone"?
Oh, Sam, I want it so much, but I have to be free of doubt before I can say yes.
Sam?
Did you notice that?
Notice what?
Everything just got calm.
I don't notice any difference.
Oh, yes, yes.
There's a difference in everything.
The whole world just changed for me.
Oh!
Look!
The stars are new.
The moon is new.
Sam Malone is new, and I like him.
And I like them, and they like me.
And none of us like you.
Am I going overboard again?
No, no, no, don't be silly.
That would mean I care, and I don't.
Bye-bye, Diane.
Where are you going?
I'm going to swim ashore.
You can't do that.
Very well I'll take the dinghy.
You See how quickly the new Sam adjusts?
You're going to just leave me out here all alone?
Yes, I am.
Sam.
Sam Malone.
If you leave me out here all alone, you are the most despicable creature on Earth!
Well, I yam what I yam, and that's all what I yam.
Hello, Mr. Clavin.
Hey, Woodrow.
Uh, suds du jour, please.
Oh, there he is!
Normie, eh!
So, uh, Vera get home from Springfield last night, huh?
Yep.
Yeah, yeah?
So, uh, how'd it go?
Well, I'll tell you, Cliff, it got pretty hot in our bedroom last night.
Whoo-hoo!
Yeah, yeah?
Air conditioning broke down.
Hey, hey!
The lucky fella.
Let me get this over with.
Uh, I asked her.
She said no.
End of bulletin.
Sorry, Sam.
I feel like dirt.
I'm fine, everybody.
I just don't want to talk about it, that's all.
Can I talk to you just for a minute?
Sure, Sam.
What can I do you for?
Well I'm kind of worried that Diane may get hurt.
My God, Sam, that is very noble of you.
No, I-I mean that I I had a dream last night that I killed her and-and-and-and it felt really good.
Does this mean I'm-I'm crazy or?
No, no, of course not.
It's very normal for most sane people to entertain insane impulses sometimes, and it's very natural to want to hurt someone that's rejected you.
Well, for example Well, there's me.
But I can't tell you how many times I felt my own hands around her windpipe strangling her fingers tightening cartilage snapping!
And, uh, I'm a respected psychiatrist.
Look, Sam, you've been through an emotional meat grinder.
My best advice to you is get away, relax reflect on what's happened.
You know, I still have the boat rented for a couple of days.
I guess I could sail up to Marblehead.
Great.
Cool it out there.
Thank you.
You know, maybe I'll work on the old tan.
Terrific.
It'll be just what the doctor ordered, Sam: sun, salt air, ocean spray in your face.
I know I-I wish I could come with you.
Well, I wish I could ask.
I understand.
Ooh, boy, how 'bout that Diane, huh?
Eh, just like all women.
If they're not turnin' down your proposal of marriage, they're they're accusin' you of suspicious behavior in the lingerie changin' room.
Oh, uh, hello, Diane.
Norman.
Excuse me, miss, aren't you confusing this bar with the one where everyone isn't repulsed by your presence?
Oh, Frasier, please tell me where Sam is.
I have to talk with him.
Diane in light of your disposal of him last night, I think it's better that he be left alone right now.
That poor man.
Can you imagine how he must feel?
Gee, I'll try.
Of course.
I'm sorry.
It's just that I'm so distraught.
I fear I've made a terrible mistake.
Sam's instincts were superior to my own.
He was right, and I was wrong.
I should've said yes.
You're running back to him?
If he'll have me.
I Oh my neck is so stiff from that water last night.
Would you give me one of your special massages?
Please?
Please, please, please?
Certainly.
Thank you.
I was such a fool out in that boat last night.
When I told him no, I was listening to my head and not my heart.
I should've known.
Sam and I are inevitable.
Why fight it?
Why fight it?
Why fight it?
Frasier You don't mind me talking to you about this, do you?
No, no, no, no.
Uh, I'm happy for you.
Feels better.
Thank you.
Good, good.
No, I'm-I'm really happy for you.
Uh, Diane, I think it's wise to go to him now.
Yes.
Uh, right-right now.
Yes, yes, right Where is he?
Oh, uh : He, uh, he, uh, took the boat to Marblehead.
Oh, thank you, Frasier.
I'll wait till tonight and motor out to the boat.
Yes.
Oh, this is perfect.
Sam will already be asleep, and I'll slip into bed beside him and give him the surprise of his life.
Eh, uh, Diane?
Sam's nose is, uh, pushed out of joint, and I think you better let him cool down.
Oh, don't be silly.
He proposed.
You can't turn off emotions like a spigot.
Besides, making up has always been the cornerstone of our relationship.
You know, that's that's what I always loved about the two of you, Diane.
That's-that's beautiful, really.
You and Sam are magic.
I should've killed her while I had the chance.
Hey, everybody.
Sam!
Thought you were on the high seas.
Yeah, well, I changed my mind.
I decided the best way to forget about Diane was to start dating some babes long on legs and short on syllables.
Sounds like a good plan, too.
Besides, I ran into an old friend of mine, Monsignor Demarest.
He needed to relax a little bit, so I sent him out to Marblehead on the boat.
Oh, my God!
What?
Nothing.
Nothing.
Oh.
Thanks for the lift.
Yes!
Yes, what?
Yes, I will marry you.
Oh, oh, I see what's happening here.
You-you're still under the assumption that that offer is still valid.
No, no, no, no.
The-the statute of limitations on that proposal ran out the second your feet hit the water.
In that case, may I suggest you propose again?
I assure you this time, I will accept your proposal.
Fine.
I propose that you step in front of a speeding bus.
You know, and I from now on, I'm dedicating myself to life, liberty and the pursuit of every woman in Boston except that one, so, to celebrate, drinks are on the house.
Come on, everybody!
Wh-What do you think you're doing?
I'm going to work.
I'll probably stop working when we get married, but I need a little money for my trousseau.
Who knows when the first little Malone will come along?
Yeah, how do I say this clearly enough to register with you?
I'm buying everybody a drink in this bar to seal the fact that you and I are through forever.
Oh, come on, Sam, come on.
Nobody believes that.
Well, go ahead.
Ask them.
Yeah, all right, I will.
Hey, turn around here for a minute, guys.
Now, after everything I just said, do you think that Diane and I will ever get back together again?
Could I have my drink before I answer?
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
Sam, two nights ago on the boat, you demonstrated in no uncertain terms that you and I are inevitable.
You said those words I had hoped to hear for so long, "Will you marry me"?
Before thinking, I responded no.
But then I realized all I needed was some time alone to clear my mind.
Now I have returned to you with a resounding "yes".
Say, Sam, I don't like it any more than you do, but I've decided to accept it.
Therefore, I am going to work here so that when you finally accept it, as we both know you will, we can move forward to build and nurture our relationship.
Excuse me.
I have customers to wait on.
No, you!
Listen, listen, I, I don't want you here.
I don't want you in the building.
I don't want you on this planet.
He's crazy about me.
No, I'm not crazy about her.
You make me sick to my stomach.
That's how I am about her.
We have kind of a little thing going.
Now, what would you like?
I'm sorry.
This isn't my table.
Miss Chambers?
You know I'm your friend and friends should stick together, so I'm really happy you're back.
Oh, Woody, thanks.
Well, kind of happy, 'cause Sam's my friend, too.
So I can't be too happy or else he'll can me, which will make me really sad.
And I know you, as my friend, wouldn't be happy about that.
So, whatever you do, don't tell Sam what I just told you.
What did you just tell me?
Perfect.
Ã¢â¢Âª Making your way in the world today Ã¢â¢Âª Takes everything you've got Taking a break from all your worries Sure would help a lot Wouldn't you like to get away Sometimes you want to go Where everybody knows your name And they're always glad you came You want to be where you can see Our troubles are all the same You want to be where everybody knows your name You want to go where people know People are all the same You want to go where everybody knows your name.
Sam, what do you think of Vivaldi at the ceremony?
You can invite anybody you want.
I don't care.
I'm not going to be As a matter of fact, nobody's going to be there 'cause there's not going to be a wedding, but if you want to work here, that's fine.
You got my blessings.
I'm glad you've come around to see the wisdom of it.
Oh, there's wisdom in it.
There's tons of wisdom.
Let me tell you why.
I want you to have a front-row seat here for all the luscious babes I'm going to have marching through here every night.
As a matter of fact, from now on, it's casaba city, and you're looking at the mayor.
You'll pardon me if I don't refer to you as "Your Honor".
You know, I'm going down to the Cape this weekend for a little R&R.
That's Rhonda and room service.
I love the Cape.
We spent so many happy hours there.
Sightseeing, talking Yeah, well, Rhonda and I aren't going to have any time for sightseeing.
We're going to be just coming up for air long enough to order some of that fish head soup.
Bouillabaisse.
No, I mean it.
Fine.
I couldn't care less.
I'll just continue on, secure in the knowledge that you love me.
I did I did not say I loved you.
You proposed to me.
Love and marriage go together.
Why else would you propose to someone?
Nevertheless do what you will, but keep in mind that you might try to sabotage this tryst of yours because deep in your heart, you know it's not right.
We are.
Oh, yeah, I see what you're doing here.
You're trying to plant a little seed in my brain.
Oh, don't be silly.
I know of nothing that grows in solid rock.
Yeah.
Hi, everybody.
: Hi, Diane.
Welcome back.
Carla, you don't seem surprised that I'm working here.
I knew you'd return.
Your kind always does.
Like roaches after atomic testing.
Well, I must say I'm relieved to see you act this way.
I was expecting something a little more violent.
No.
I'm glad you're back.
You see, I got this theory.
If you and Sam hang around each other long enough, one of you is going to kill the other.
Now, if Sam kills you, fine.
If you kill Sam, I'll turn you in, get a reward, and you'll get the chair.
Either way I come up a winner.
I think we're becoming friends.
Let's have a slumber party sometime.
Hey, there's a kitty-cat in here.
A guy gave 'em to me on the way in this morning.
You know my kids have been giving me a lot of crap about not having any pets, so I figure Max here ought to shut 'em up for a while.
Well, what do you call the little one?
What little one?
You know, all that wheat's making you hallucinate.
Oh, great, she's having babies!
There's another one!
You're a farmboy.
What are you supposed to do to stop this?
Well, it's too late to go to the drugstore.
I swear, I swear, this cat was not pregnant when I got it.
The minute it becomes a Tortelli, it starts dropping 'em like  Oh, yeah, there you are.
Well, I'm off for my weekend, Diane.
Cheers.
Oh, by the way, did I tell you that Rhonda was double-jointed?
Hey, Sam, it's for you.
Yeah, hello.
Oh, hey, Rhonda.
I was just talking about you.
Oh, oh, no, don't do this to me.
Well can't you be born again on Monday?
All right, all right, Well, you, too.
Whew, do you believe that?
She canceled on me.
Women.
Reminds me of what my Uncle Henry used to say.
Oh, yeah?
What was that, Woody?
Women.
Hey, uh, Sammy, don't let Diane hear about Rhonda.
She'll load that info into her shotgun and take aim, huh?
Yeah, no one is going to ruin Sam Malone's weekend, no matter what Diane says.
Yeah, hello, Vicki?
Yeah, it's Sam Malone.
Yeah, yeah, listen, uh, how, how does the idea of, uh, 48 hours of sun and surf up at the Cape grab ya?
Oh, yeah?
Well, if that grabs ya, how's the idea of me grabbing you grab you?
Yeah, all right.
All right.
Yeah, me, too.
Okay, I, I'll see ya in about two hours then, Vicki.
All right.
Bye-bye.
Yeah.
I thought her name was Rhonda.
Well, uh Rhonda canceled.
But that's good.
That's good because I like, I like Vicki better than Rhonda.
As a matter of fact, I kind of hope that, that Vicki cancels because I have somebody even better waiting in the wings.
I know.
Me.
No, no, not you.
You know, Vicki, I just want you to know that this is going to be the most beautiful, terrific, special weekend of my entire life.
Listen, you don't need to keep selling me on this weekend.
No, I I'm sold.
All right.
I'm famished.
I wish they'd take our order.
Oh, they'll be here.
Don't worry.
Nothing's going to ruin this weekend, I'll tell ya.
Ah, perfect.
Have you decided?
What'll you have?
Ah, what's the Catch of the Day?
You mean besides me?
Ah, this is great.
Isn't this great?
We're having fun, right.
I'll take the scallops.
Yeah, uh, that two of those.
That'll be good.
Oh, geez!
Are you sure you're okay?
Yeah, are you kidding me?
That was fun for me.
Wasn't it fun for you?
I mean, it's spontaneous, refreshing.
Oh, it's great.
I'll move you to another table.
Don't you dare.
This is perfect.
Thank you very much.
You know, someone tried to convince me that this weekend was going to be a total disaster.
Really?
Who?
That person right there!
Sam!
What a surprise.
Hello.
Hello.
I'm Vicki.
I'm Leaving immediately.
Diane.
Are you enjoying your weekend?
Of course she's enjoying her weekend.
It's a fantastic weekend.
Did you notice your table's all wet?
That's 'cause we want it that way.
As a matter of fact, we ordered it wet.
Hey, you know, I think it's drying out a little bit, don't you?
Here you go.
That's better.
Excuse me, Miss.
There's a telephone call for you at the desk.
Thank you.
I'll be right back.
I'll miss you.
What the hell are you doing here?
Mm, you know, all your talk of a lovely weekend at the Cape made me realize how much I needed to get away myself.
It's just the most incredible coincidence that we ended up at the same place.
I know what you're trying to do.
You're trying to rattle me, but the joke's on you, because I'm better under pressure.
I don't rattle.
Only when you shake your head.
Have fun.
Okay.
You know, you just guaranteed this is going to be the most perfect weekend ever.
Oh, good, yeah, you're back.
Yeah, that's perfect.
Now why don't you sit down over there.
This might be wet here.
Sam?
Hmm?
I'm afraid I have to leave.
Oh, God, no, don't say that, please.
I'm sorry.
Look, that was my sister on the phone.
Our grandmother's ill.
I have to fly to Idaho.
Why?
You're not a doctor.
Please, please, don't Sam, I'm sorry this happened, but you're going to have to drive me back.
No, no, uh I have to stay here.
Uh, I'll call you a cab.
Well, as long as you don't go out of your way.
What, again, Vicki?
Even rabbits take a break to eat.
When you're finished there, go upstairs and help the lady in Mr. Malone's room with her bags.
She's checking out?
Her grandmother's ill.
I'd heard she was dead.
It's nice to know she's just sick.
WOMAN : Pat, I'd like to buy a vowel.
A vowel?
There are only two spaces left.
She wants to buy a vowel.
Where do they get these people?
Who is it?
Room service.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, good, thank you.
Put put it right over there.
Okay.
I bet you're wondering why I ordered two of everything when there's only me up here, huh?
Uh, no, not really.
Well, actually, it's 'cause I want to give the impression that there are two people in the room.
Well, you fooled me.
Oh.
Good, good, good.
Where are my hot fudge sundaes?
I couldn't fit 'em on the tray.
I'll be right back up.
All right.
Great, great.
Uh, make sure you parade around the lobby a couple of times before you bring 'em on up.
Will ya?
Sure.
Hello.
Hi, Sam.
How's it going up there?
Uh, fine.
Fine.
Oh, don't do that, Vicki.
I'm ticklish.
Sam, I feel an apology is in order.
I may have made your friend Vicki a bit uncomfortable earlier today.
Well, she's plenty comfortable right now, so, uh, I'll pass on her message.
Bye-bye, Diane.
No, no, Sam.
I wouldn't feel right unless I expressed my feelings personally.
Let me speak with her, please.
Shoot.
She's in the, uh, the bathroom right now.
She's tickling you from the bathroom?
Well, she just went in there.
She she always runs into the bathroom after she tickles me.
Perhaps it's nausea.
Sam, I, I really want to apologize to her face-to-face.
I'll be right up.
No, no, no, no, don't  Oh, good, good, good.
Do me a favor, will ya?
I'll pay you $50.
I beg your pardon.
Let's go, Harvey.
No, no, no, please.
No funny stuff at all.
Uh, come, come on now.
You'll be saving my life here.
Come, come on in.
Come in.
Now hold it now.
Just a minute here.
I promise you.
No weird stuff.
I just want your wife to go in the bathroom and make some noises.
What kind of noises?
I don't know, uh woman kind of stuff.
Like you're getting all dolled up for some hot action.
What does that sound like?
Uh, eh, I don't know.
Whatever you and Harvey do Never mind.
Never mind.
Just, uh Here you go.
$50.
Hi, Sam.
Hey.
Where's Vicki?
She's, uh, still in the bathroom.
Well, I'll just wait.
Huh?
No, uh You know, um this could take a little while here.
Why don't you, uh, why don't you just yell your apologies through the door here?
Oh, that's silly.
I'll be here all weekend.
I can certainly wait.
She sure is busy.
Is that enough or should we snap some towels?
It's the, uh, bathroom inspector.
It's a new thing.
Sam let's call an end to this nonsense right now.
I don't care how rough you were on her; that is not Vicki.
See, I know Vicki left.
I've known all along.
And you let me go through this whole stupid act?
Well, I wanted to see how far you'd go-- ordering two sets of meals, leaving empty bottles of Vitamin E outside your door Yeah, well, what about you?
You know, coming all the way up here to spy on me?
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
Yeah?
What's the use?
We both look like imbeciles.
All we do is find new ways to humiliate each other.
I humiliate you by saying "no" to your sweet proposal.
You humiliate me by rejecting my retraction.
You carry off this ridiculous charade.
I spy on you in hotel rooms.
It's become sick and degrading.
And, quite frankly, I'm embarrassed to be a part of it, Sam.
Yeah, well, I'm not too thrilled you're part of it either.
Here you go, pal.
Oh Oh, yeah, yeah.
I guess this all looks pretty weird, doesn't it?
Oh, nothing I haven't seen before.
I believe you owe us $50.
Now there's a new one.
Boy, Carla, you know, I never thought you'd be able to unload all those kittens in one night.
Yeah, it was just a simple matter of marketing technique, you know.
Giving away a beer with each kitten really did the trick.
Come on.
Here, Toots, time for your first cab ride.
You know you guys are really gonna love Vera.
She has legs just like a scratching post.
Oh, good evening.
Good evening.
Oh, it's you.
Small world.
Mm I thought I was eating late enough to avoid seeing you.
Me, too.
The only reason why I waited so long to eat.
Oh, I thought perhaps it was because you've been eating for two.
I'm kind of glad you're here.
I've been sitting here driving myself crazy.
When we used to come here, wasn't there a lobster trap out in the lobby?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I guess the lobsters finally wised up and starting coming through the kitchen.
By the way, I suppose I owe you an apology for being here this weekend.
In retrospect, I guess it was probably a mistake.
Probably?
I'd say "definitely" if you were to admit that it was a mistake to flaunt your date in front of me.
Apology accepted.
Boy, you know the one thing I really hate is to eat alone.
I always feel like someone's looking at me.
I'm the only one here.
Well, you're looking at me.
Then you can either join me or I can eat with my eyes closed.
Well, I hate to have you butter your knuckles.
Good.
Sam, you know what I remember most about being here before?
Oh, sure, sure.
Yeah, I think the salt air gives me extra stamina.
Actually, I was thinking of the Clams Oregano, but now that you mention it, I did enjoy the salt air.
Sam, what I said before about our relationship, I'm I'm sorry I said it.
I was upset.
It may not be ideal, but it hasn't been without its moments.
Speaking of moments, this, uh, is beginning to feel like one here.
Yes, I think I've decided what I want, and it's not on the menu.
Oh, you want to skip the main course and jump right into the "Sammy SoufflÃ©"?
I see you haven't lost your way with words.
Let's go.
Yes, this is the perfect moment.
But it is with the understanding, isn't it, of what this step we're about to take means?
Oh, yeah, yeah, no problem.
If they give us any trouble, I'll just pay for both rooms.
What it means between us.
Oh, now wait, listen.
Listen.
No, it has to mean something, Sam.
I'm only gonna agree to do this if, if we agree that it doesn't mean anything.
How can our lovemaking not mean something?
Well, it's easy.
Just concentrate.
I don't want to get caught up in a war of words with you.
What I'm feeling right now is very special, and I think we should go upstairs and be with each other and figure out what it means afterwards.
Let's go.
No.
What?
I-I gotta be clear what I'm doing here.
I mean, my gut's telling me one thing, but my, my head's telling me something quite different.
I don't believe what I'm hearing.
Oh!
Gotcha.
You were joking?
Yeah.
How's it feel?
I mean, how do you like it when you get your motor all revved up and then someone jerks the rug out from under you?
Well, mixed metaphors aside, I don't like it a bit.
Yeah.
But your point is well taken, and I deserved that.
Well, great.
All right.
Come on.
Let's go.
No.
What do you mean "no"?
Oh, all right, I see what you doing.
That's good.
That's, that's very funny.
That's  All right.
Come on.
No, the only place I'm going is home.
You know, it's very funny.
I laughed.
The joke's over.
Sam, this is the wrong time for physical dalliance.
It's too soon.
If we rush into a physical encounter now, we might ruin the much more important nuptial consummation coming up.
Smell the old salt air.
Sam, please.
This is nothing to worry about.
We're on the right course.
When we're married, you'll be happy we waited.
Really, this is nothing to be upset about.
Bye-bye.
Fine.
Fine, fine, fine, fine.
I mean, it's perfect.
You said someone was gonna ruin this weekend, but now I'm really gonna have some fun here.
Shoot.
Did we lose another one?
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
Hey, Mr. Clavin's back.
Whatta you say, Woody?
How was your trip to Expo?
Oh, a once-in-a-lifetime experience.
I tell ya.
You know, no ears have heard, no eyes have seen the wonders I've experienced these past two weeks in Canada.
If I died right now, I'd be a happy person.
You wouldn't be the only one.
Hey, uh, Normie, you should have seen this 3-D movie they had about life in Vancouver.
You know, with those glasses on, you felt like you were really there.
You were there, Cliff.
I've been readin' up on Expo.
Did you catch that bullet train they got there?
No, I guess I missed that one.
Did you see the Great Hall of Ramses?
Uh, no, no, I guess that slid right by me yeah.
Uh, how about the U.S. space exhibit?
No.
Chinese acrobats?
Uh-uh.
Hey, Cliff!
How was Expo?
A major disappointment, Sam.
Making your way in the world today Takes everything you've got Taking a break from all your worries Sure would help a lot Wouldn't you like to get away Sometimes you want to go Where everybody knows your name And they're always glad you came You want to be where you can see Our troubles are all the same You want to be where everybody knows your name You want to go where people know People are all the same Ã¢â¢Âª You want to go where everybody knows your name.
Ã¢â¢Âª Sam, Yeah.
I need a Dewar's rocks and a Grand Marnier, please.
Comin' up.
Did you have a chance to look at the catalog I left for you?
What catalog?
This catalog with the silverware patterns.
To go with our china and fine crystal.
Sam, we have to make a decision, if we're going to be registered.
Some people in the bar are starting to ask about gifts.
Who?
What people?
Where?
Aw, Norm.
I just asked if ya had to give one, all right?
Anyway, Sam, should we have a big wedding?
No, no, I think we should have a military one.
All 21 guns aimed at the bride.
Hey, Fitz.
Still Irish?
As Paddy's pig.
All right.
Make it the usual, Sam.
Uh, drinks for everybody.
So, uh, who's the geezer?
That's Mr. Fitzgerald.
He's come in every day for the past two weeks and bought drinks for everybody.
Yeah?
Gee, he's a heck of a guy.
You know, I think, in many ways, Mr. Fitzgerald and I are alike.
We both come here seeking warmth and camaraderie.
A safe haven from the outside world.
You know, a place where you can always feel welcome.
Excuse me, pal, you're on my stool.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't realize.
Eh, look at him, huh?
Mr. Big Shot over there.
What does he think he is, a "bon vivone" or something?
He's about the richest guy you'll ever meet, Cliff.
Why don't we join him?
Hey, Fitzie, thanks for that $20 tip last night.
But I don't want ya gettin' the wrong idea about me.
Carla, I know that your favors are not for sale.
See?
That's what I mean about the wrong idea.
Eh, howdy.
Cliff Clavin.
Duncan Fitzgerald.
Nice to meet you.
Yeah, so, uh, you, uh, you live in the neighborhood?
Well, I just moved here.
I was originally from Michigan.
The, uh, Wolverine State, huh?
Interesting, interesting.
So, I hear you're stinkin' rich.
Real smooth, Cliff.
Very smooth.
Uh, Fitz is actually kind of a minor celebrity, I guess.
He invented a little something we call the, uh, the refill, right?
Is that right?
No, no, no, no.
It wasn't the refill.
It was The metal vapor input valve.
It's, uh, used on most, uh, commercial and military jet engines.
Oh, yeah.
I never step on a plane without lookin' right out on that wing and see if there's one out there.
Actually, it's located in the tail.
Uh, well, yeah, yeah.
It's, uh, 'cause if ya saw it on the wing, then you'd know you were in a lot of trouble, huh?
As long as we're talkin' business here, who, uh, who does your books, sir?
McCann and Williams.
McCann and Williams.
Uh, can I talk to you about that over a game of darts?
Sure.
I think I could do better than those guys.
What do you like best about them?
Well, I must say I like their aggressiveness.
Sir, I think I can be just as aggressive.
I doubt that.
Yeah, you're probably right.
He's a great guy.
Yeah, it's too bad that we seem to be his only family.
No wife?
He's a widower.
Boy, I'm tellin' you, with all the millions he's got, if I was an old bat, I'd snatch him up in a minute.
Ma.
What's that, Cliff?
Huh?
Oh, uh, well, you know, my ma's been dyin' to come down here for, uh, years to meet all the guys at the bar.
Hey!
Tonight's a good a night as any, huh?
I wish I'd thought of that.
I'd try to get my mother down here first, but it takes a forklift to get her off the couch.
Hey, Clavin, Fitz really wants to leave.
Yeah, yeah, she's comin' now.
Just hang on a minute.
Hold him there.
Hi, there.
Ma, what took you so long to get down here?
Well, I wanted to look my best for your friends.
And this is two hours' worth?
Uh, Ma, this is Cheers.
Yeah, this is the odor I'm always washing out of your shirts.
Well, come on in, Ma.
I, I want to introduce you to the finest, greatest bunch of pals a guy could have anywhere on the Earth.
I'm tellin' ya.
Everybody, this is Ma.
Ma, this everybody.
Ma, you just stand right there for a few seconds, huh?
I'll be right back.
So I guess Mr. Clavin's told you a lot about us, huh?
No, actually, Clifford doesn't talk much around the house.
That Cliff?
That's right.
Some days, not a peep.
Of course, the same thing occurs in nature, too.
It's a little-known fact that arctic wolves that remained in the den too long exhibited a tendency to be reticent in their howling.
Ah.
Now, when I read that Hey, Ma, Ma, Ma, come on.
You're boring the pants off these people here.
Well, look who's here.
Ma, I'd like you to meet a dear, dear, old, very close friend of mine.
Mr. Fitzgerald, this is my ma, Esther Clavin.
Nice to meet you.
Duncan here's originally from Michigan, Ma.
Oh.
Have a seat.
Yeah, my ma's been to your home state.
Oh, really?
No, I've been to Maine and Montana, but not Michigan.
Isn't that fascinating, huh?
Perhaps, if you live in a cave.
Isn't she a firecracker?
Uh, say, Mrs. Clavin, uh, did you know that Fitz over there invented a technical gizmo on jet airplanes?
Oh, really?
Yeah, yeah, what a coincidence, huh, Ma?
You've, uh, you've ridden in jet planes before, haven't you?
No, I walked to Montana.
Normie, I'm sinkin' fast.
Uh, correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't you two share a war together?
Hey, yeah.
That's, that's right.
Uh, Ma, where were you during the big one?
Clifford, you know I was in New York.
I worked at the USO on 42nd Street.
I was in charge of table games.
Universal checker championships, Tuesdays and Thursdays at 9:00 p.m. Oh, my goodness!
Ladies red, gentlemen black.
Right.
Your host  Bobby Holloway.
That's right!
That's right.
Bobby Holloway.
Oh, Bobby Holloway.
Oh, Bobby Holloway.
Isn't this beautiful, huh?
Hey, why don't you two finish up your reminiscing over some nice baked sea bass, huh?
That's the, uh, special up there at Melville's.
Well, I could use a bite.
Well, I guess I'm feeling kind of peckish, too.
Great.
Hey, and listen, it's my treat.
Now, I absolutely, positively, insist-- dinner is on me.
Oh, I can take care of it, Cliff.
You got it!
Oh, what lovely buttons.
Did you know that buttons on a man's jacket sleeve have absolutely no purpose?
They originated on the uniforms of Napoleon's army when he discovered that his soldiers were using their sleeves to wipe their noses.
Oh, she's gonna flap her gums all the way to the poorhouse.
Hey, Cliff!
Hey, Sammy!
Have you heard the latest in the, uh, Ma-Fitz romance?
No, no.
What's goin' on?
Yeah, they're celebratin' their first week together with a picnic on the Charles.
Whoa, the Charles!
Boy, that's the make-out capital of the world.
And if he does as well as I do, there's gonna be a lotta panting and rolling around and shopping.
There's a mall right next to the Charles.
Oh, yeah.
Speaking of the devil Oh, hey, Ma, Fitz!
I thought you two were on the way to the Charles.
Well, we are.
Are you busy?
What's up, Ma?
Sit down, son.
Clifford, now I know how much your father meant to you, and I know it's going to take a while for you to adjust to this, to having a new father.
Daddy!
My God!
Clifford, I haven't even kissed him on the lips.
Hey, everybody!
Wedding bells at the Clavin compound!
When's the happy day, folks?
Tomorrow.
Sammy, champagne!
Oh, Duncan, I'm gonna throw you the biggest bachelor bash Beantown's ever seen!
Normie, call all my friends.
I think he moved.
Well, then call all yours.
Woody, I'm gonna make you entertainment chairman, huh?
Hot dog!
Get on the horn there, call the Parker House and, uh, order me up their fanciest room.
You got it.
Wow, my first bachelor party.
No dates, right?
No.
Hey, uh, congratulations there, Fitzie.
Thank you.
Listen, if things don't work out with Esther, here is my mother's number, okay?
Let it ring ten or 15 minutes.
She'll get there.
Oh, you two.
I'm so happy for you.
You know, Cliff, your mother is the first person who's ever really loved me for me instead of my checkbook.
Oh, Ma That's why I'm donating the bulk of my fortune to charity.
Giving money away.
Actually it was your mother's idea.
Ma's?
I didn't want Duncan to have any doubts about my feelings.
How are you two gonna live?
Well, I'm not gonna give it all away.
I'll keep enough for the two of us to be comfortable.
We're simple people-- we don't need much to live.
And you're self-sufficient, not to mention that postal pension you're always bragging about.
Mr. Clavin, it's the Parker House.
They want to know if you want the Embassy Court or the Grand Ballroom.
Give me that!
Give me that phone!
Fraternity prank.
What, are you nuts, Woody?
I can't afford a party.
Parties are for rich people.
I'm poor.
I've always been poor.
I'll always be poor.
I'm gonna die poor!
I'd like to resign as entertainment chairman.
Listen, I don't know how to say this to you without offending you, but you're behaving like a class-A jerk.
Oh, am I?
Well, what have I got to celebrate?
Well, for one thing, your mother's met a very nice man who's making her very happy.
And?
Cliff!
Well all right.
All right, of course you're right.
I guess I just forgot how much Ma means to me.
Yeah, I'll have the party for her sake.
It'll just have to be the economy version.
You know, no frills.
Well, if it'll help out, we'll close the bar early, and you can have it here.
Why, thank you, Samuel.
That's very nice of you.
Hey!
Hey, wait a second.
Who knows, when Fitz sees what a nice guy I am, maybe he'll, uh, remember me in his will.
Yeah.
"To the idiot son of my new wife, I leave squat".
Uh, Mr. Clavin, some of your guests have been asking if they can take the plastic wrap off the food.
Huh.
Don't they understand?
When food is exposed to air, just about anything can happen.
Yeah, people could eat it.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, very funny, wise guy.
Oink, oink, Mr. Peterson.
Let's have a little restraint.
This food's got to last us the rest of the night.
Oh, the girls are here!
Oh, Sammy, Sammy, I thought this was gonna be a low-budget affair.
My treat.
Oh, hey, well, in that case, ladies, welcome!
Shake it, bake it, let's see if we can take it!
Oh, come on in here and let me introduce you to the, uh, the guest of honor tonight.
There he is.
Sic him!
: Hey!
Eh, so, Fitz, how are you enjoying your bachelor party so far?
I haven't been this excited since I first trapped vapor in my input valve.
No man forgets his first time, huh?
: Oh, my!
Hey, don't worry, Fitz, they're not gonna bite.
Yeah, he's right.
That costs extra.
Hey!
Hey, girls.
What're you doing back here?
I thought you had a bachelorette party going.
Yeah, yeah, but, uh, I have to borrow some money against next week's loan.
Can you give me 50 bucks?
All right.
What do you, uh what do you need it for?
We're going to a dance recital.
You need 50 bucks for a dance recital?
We have to have something to stick in the guys' underwear.
Good for you.
Esther here is okay.
I mean, you can't blame her for one horrible crime against humanity.
Where, uh where's Diane?
We ditched her.
There you are!
How on earth did we get separated?
I have no idea.
I thought we all got in the taxi, but when it pulled away from the curb, I was the only one inside.
Uh, this is this is fun, but, I you girls are gonna have to leave.
This is "men only" here.
Oh Oh Okay, okay.
You know, instead of going to that club you suggested, we could try Cafe au Lait.
They have a wonderful new harpist, I hear.
Oh, great.
No, that sounds like fun.
I'll hail a cab.
Let's go!
Hey, Normie, Normie, things are going very smoothly.
Yeah, yeah, I think Fitz might donate some money to, uh, my favorite charity.
Yeah?
What's that?
Save the Clavin Foundation.
I am having the time of my life!
I knew you would, Fitz.
You know, I didn't warm up to you at first, but, uh, I'm beginning to think you're not so bad after all.
Yeah?
When did you come to that conclusion?
Figure it out for yourself.
Then she says to her girlfriend, "Maybe so, but this one's eating my popcorn".
Okay, okay, I guess it's time for me to take off the psychiatrist's cap and tell one of my own.
All right!
All right, well, it seems there's these two men stranded on a deserted island.
Doug and Dave.
Oh, oh, wait, wait, wait.
This is better with dialects.
Uh Okay, so an Irishman and a Dane are stranded on a-- no, wait a second.
I-I don't do Danish.
Um Okay!
An Irishman and a Swede.
All right.
That's it.
Patrick and Lars.
So Lars turns to Patrick one day, and he goes, uh : "How much water have you left"?
Oh, no, gee, wait a second.
I-I think one of them's supposed to be a rabbi.
Whoa!
The King of the Conga.
Hey, Cliffy, how am I doing?
Ah, you're a vision, Fitz, a vision!
Woody, I don't think I've done that since my wedding.
Oh, you conga'd at your wedding?
No, I sweated.
Okay, now, I want to get the punch line just right because otherwise, I'll ruin the whole joke.
Uh, you know, it's all the noise in here.
Would you mind?
It's kind of distracting.
I'll, uh, I'll be back in a second.
Kick up your heels, Fitz.
That's it, faster!
Hey, Fitz!
Fitz, hey, maybe you ought to sit one out.
You've been going pretty hard there.
No, no, Sammy, it's his last night to howl.
Let him live it up, huh?
Hey, listen, thank you, Cliffy.
You've given me one of the very great nights of my life.
And I want to promise you I'm gonna take very good care of you.
Sammy is there a tear in my eye?
No, no.
Are there dollar signs in my eyes?
Yeah, I think there are, Cliffy.
: Oh-ho Hey, Normie, did you hear that?
I'm gonna be rollin' in it!
Yeah, you been rollin' in it for years, Cliff.
Come quick!
This is terrible!
Fitz is really sick!
Oh, my God!
Okay, I've got it!
: "Glory be.
Nobody knows the rubble I've seen".
No, no, that wasn't it.
All right, before we go home, one more time.
Fitz.
Hell of a guy.
To Fitz.
Fitz.
Fitz.
It was a lovely service.
And, Diane, your choice of poem was wonderful.
Thank you.
I just wish I hadn't been cut off right in the middle.
We had to-- the eternal flame was starting to go out.
Good night, Sammy.
Yeah.
Good night, all.
You know, funerals are a lot different here than they are back home.
Yeah?
How's that, Woody?
Well, where I come from, when somebody dies, people come from miles around, bake lots of pies, bring all kinds of food, make speeches, ride the roller coaster.
Oh, wait, that might be the state fair.
Ma you okay?
I'm fine.
I just was gonna straighten up in here a little.
You don't have to do that, Ma.
No, I want to.
Oh, will you look at the rings on this table.
Don't people use coasters anymore?
Ma whenever you're trying to hide something inside, you always pick up some household chore to do.
Now, I don't know if you realize it, but since Fitz passed away, you you haven't cried, you you haven't got upset, you haven't shown any kind of emotion.
Well, what's there to be upset about?
I barely knew the man.
We just had some good times together, that's all.
Ma stop wiping.
That's it, Ma.
You just let it all out now.
Good, good.
Now, don't you feel better?
Yeah, that should just about do it, huh?
Good.
One last little spurt.
Ma, you know, there's a fine line between expressing your feelings and blubbering.
I'm sorry.
I guess you're right.
I'll get you a glass of water, Ma.
Oh, well.
Life goes on.
I guess I have to accept the fact that I'm not the type that good things happen to.
Well, I don't know, Ma.
I mean, there was, uh, one good thing that happened to you about, uh, well, 37 years ago.
There certainly was-- not many women get to shake hands with Bing Crosby.
: Well, there you are, huh?
Oh, Cliff, you know I mean you.
You're my pride and joy.
You're the best thing that ever happened to me.
Gee, think of that.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
MAN : so grab your rod and reel, and join us next week when Jim takes us trolling on Lake Winnebeshaki.
Nice show, huh?
Well, if you ask me, there's something wrong with watching televised fishing.
Not the same impact as watching it live, huh, Woody?
Hey, you know something?
I got a great idea.
What's to stop us from taking a little fishing trip ourselves?
We don't want to?
Oh.
Come on, it'd be fun.
You know, we could go this very afternoon, head out to Lake Winthrop, huh?
What do you say?
All right.
Okay.
All right, let's get organized here, uh, Woody.
Uh, I'd like you to be in charge of bait and tackle, okay?
Got you.
Cliffy in charge of, uh, food and the transportation.
Okay.
Well, what're you in charge of, Mr. Peterson?
Finding a reason not to go.
Ah, here we go.
Huh?
Gladiator film festival at the Majestic.
Yeah, that's a good one.
Boom, boom, boom, boom  De gustibus non est disputandum!
Making your way in the world today Takes everything you've got Taking a break from all your worries Sure would help a lot Wouldn't you like to get away Ã¢â¢Âª Sometimes you want to go Ã¢â¢Âª Ã¢â¢Âª Where everybody knows your name Ã¢â¢Âª And they're always glad you came You want to be where you can see Our troubles are all the same You want to be where everybody knows your name You want to go where people know People are all the same You want to go where everybody knows your name.
Hi, Sam.
Hi.
Oh, uh, some customer was in with some tickets to some concert, sounded foreign and dull.
I thought you wouldn't want to miss it.
Thank you.
Jean Pierre Rampal!
It was just some customer.
I didn't really catch his name.
Oh.
He's a flautist.
Nothing less than brilliant.
No other player could so eloquently fuse the world of classical music to that of modern jazz.
What a perfect performer for us to see on this, our first official date together in our new-found relationship.
What should I wear?
Something long or tea length?
Why don't you wear something you can stretch out in?
Oh.
The seat next to you's gonna be empty.
Sam!
Come on, please.
Can't you scrape somebody else up to go?
Please.
And the operative word there is "scrape".
There's only one man I want to be with.
No, no, I'll go alone.
And it'll be fine.
Mm.
Miss Chambers, I might be back from my fishing trip in time to take you, if I don't stop to clean up first.
No, thank you, Woody, that's very sweet.
Maybe next time.
Okeydoke, but I don't know when I'm gonna be going fishing again.
Cliffy, it was not ten.
I had 11 of 'em.
11!
You're wrong, Normie, you're wrong, wrong, wrong.
How was the Gladiator film fest, fellas?
Not now, Sammy.
We're awash in controversy.
You had ten, Norm, just like me.
Ten what?
Anachronisms.
Huh?
Oh, you know, those things that, uh, aren't in the time period in which the film is set.
Normie and I like to see who-who gets the most.
Today it was me.
11!
Normie, you had ten just like me.
There was no way it was Caesar Augustus wearing Reeboks.
Hey, so you guys ready to go fishing?
Uh we got to You know, Woody, uh, couple beers first.
You know, I work up a powerful thirst watching, uh, Thoracian dogs smite Spartan pigs, you know.
Greetings, everyone.
Hey, Frasier.
How about a beer?
Oh, well, no, Sam, just make it a club soda.
I've got to appear on TV today, and I want to keep my wits about me.
Oh my!
No kidding?
What's the TV show?
Well, it's a local talk show called Psychology This Week.
Oh.
Oh, maybe you heard it.
I don't know.
I know all about that show.
It's where once a week a couple of shrinks get together and debate certain aspects of the psychological condition.
That's right.
Oh, man, we had to pick today to go fishing, huh, Cliff?
Well, I'm surprised.
I didn't know you were a fan.
Hmm Well, he was, but he stopped watching when they lost the hostess with the big Hindenburgs.
It's on at 4:00.
It promises to be very cerebral, and, uh, I might add, uh, darned entertaining.
Well, uh, unfortunately, Frasier, it interferes with another highly cerebral event-- the, uh, Raiders - Patriots game.
Yeah, right.
I realize that football is a rarity on television in the fall, but don't you think we could spare half an hour to see our friend, Frasier?
Do you have any idea how much action you can miss in a half an hour of football?
About 18 seconds.
Oh, all right, all right.
I guess it won't hurt much.
Thank you, Sam.
Cheers.
Yeah, hold on a second.
Oh.
You want to tell me what the taxicab was doing, uh, parked in front of the Temple of Athena?
Yeah all right, uh, it was, uh uh it was, uh, probably taking Demitrius to the airport.
Well, thank you.
Well, as it turns out, you can now watch your game with a clear conscience.
I won't be doing that show after all.
What changed your mind, Frasier?
Well, Dr. Foster had to cancel, and, uh Dr. Sternin is going to take his place.
Lilith Sternin?
You mean that-- uh, pardon my French-- woman you once dated?
That's a rather charitable description, Cliff.
Well, I just hope they can find someone to replace me as readily as they did Dr. Foster.
Can't handle debating a woman, eh?
A woman, yes.
An ice cube in heels, no!
Look, I have no intention of entering a debate with those cold, gray eyes and those clever, smirking lips.
I'd rather clip my nails in a Cuisinart.
Oh, my.
What's wrong?
Oh, don't you see?
Frasier's in love.
He's what?
Oh, come on, Sam.
You're forgetting I was once romantically involved with Frasier.
I know when he's enamored of someone.
Didn't you see his nostrils flare?
And everyone knows that hate is not the opposite of love.
Indifference is.
Well, whatever you say.
I really don't care.
Touch?
, Sam.
Let's be honest.
Quite often you've expressed feelings of antagonism toward me, and we both know how much you love me.
I I do not love you, Diane, and I have the nostrils to prove it.
And you You're wrong about Frasier.
I mean, I know psychobabble when I hear it, and I also Wait.
Uh Frasier?
There's a theory going around the bar that you're ticked off with Dr. Sternin because you're in love with her.
What do you think?
Well, that sounds like someone who doesn't know shortcake from Shinola.
Hey, good guess, good guess-- Diane.
Oh, well, hmm.
That's nothing but mere cocktail-party psychology.
Believe it or not, Sam, it's actually possible to have hostile feelings toward someone without being in love with them.
You mean I can actually hate Diane without having it mean anything more than I hate her?
Feel free.
Ooh!
Oh, I better cancel that appearance before it's too late.
Hang on.
There you go.
Uh-oh!
Frost warning.
Good afternoon, Dr. Crane.
Dr. Sternin.
What a lovely surprise.
I hope I can regard that as civility in light of today's situation, rather than sarcasm at my expense.
No, that was completely at your expense.
You know, I wasn't going to do today's show when I heard you were the other guest, but then I realized I'd relish proving my superiority over you in public.
Yes, that appeals to me, too.
So, I felt we should at least discuss some procedures of conduct.
Ah, well Don't you dare.
My mistake.
So, am I to assume that you just naturally thought that I'd be at this drinking establishment?
Actually, knowing your obsessive-compulsiveness, I checked with your service, and indeed, you'd left them a very complete itinerary of your day.
I trust all went well at the dry cleaner's.
Thank you, yes.
And I can assume from your questioning that you're attempting to make idle conversation rather than articulating some control dysfunction with my personal habits.
That's correct.
Are they fighting?
First of all, I think any mention of our past relationship could tarnish the objectivity factor of the show.
You call that a relationship?
I mean, we dated one time.
The closest we came to physical contact was when you closed the car door on my hand.
Are you repressing?
Oh!
Forgive me.
Actually, you're quite right.
Yes, I should be straightforward in telling you that you are passionless, stoic and emotionally numb.
Apology accepted.
Merci.
Yeah, I'm pretty sure they're fighting.
He just asked for mercy.
Secondly, I think perhaps we Look, Dr. Sternin, if you'll excuse me, I have to cash a check and fill up my gas tank before the show.
Yes, I know.
Have the attendant make sure your tires aren't as inflated as your ego.
You know, you perplex me.
Oh?
Yes, normally people of your limited physical appeal make up for it with an actual personality.
Dr. Sternin, excuse me.
I overheard Dr. Crane's remarks.
If it's any consolation, I can empathize with your hurt feelings.
If you'd like to share any of them with me as a fellow woman, I would consider it an honor.
Who are you?
Diane Chambers.
I'm an old friend of Dr. Crane's, a student, and until my imminent marriage, an employee here at Cheers.
Please, let's sit down.
Well, I suppose I am just a little sensitive when it pertains to my appearance.
Well, if I may be so bold as to step into your arena, I believe that Frasier's hostility is masking a deep attraction to you.
Thank you, Diane.
It's been a long time since I've had such a good laugh.
Why would Frasier Crane be attracted to me?
I'm not that kind of woman.
But you can be.
It just takes a little softening of the edges.
Perhaps loosen the bun a bit to relieve some of the tension in your face.
I'm afraid it's not as easy as all that.
Oh, that's nonsense.
Look I'm not far from here.
Why don't you come over to my place, and I'll show you what I mean?
We'll just put a little more makeup on, or some.
I really don't think I can do that.
Oh, come on, Dr. Sternin.
You're going to be on television today.
A little refinement of your appearance might give you an edge in the debate.
Well, I suppose it wouldn't hurt.
Good, good!
Let me get my things.
Sam, may I have my purse, please?
Oh, and I'm going to be taking my lunch hour a little early today.
Thank you for showing up at all.
You're welcome.
Shall we go?
You know, I've always envied women like you who could simply tumble out of bed each morning looking blonde and perky.
Oh, well, I must admit, in my case, there is a little labor involved.
A little labor?
She's calls in Local 416.
Yeah.
Oh.
Yeah?
Come on, guys.
Yeah, I think they Okay, the tank's full, and the gear's all loaded.
I got everything you could possibly need for a fishing trip.
Uh, Woody, look, uh, we're right in the middle of the game, huh?
I got a battery-operated portable TV in the car.
We got a few beers to finish here yet, buddy.
I got a cooler full icing down in the trunk.
Yup, I think the kid's outlasted us, Norm.
Hot dog!
Look out, trout!
Hey, if you guys don't mind, I'll do the driving.
All right, I got shotgun.
Wouldn't it be more sporting to use a fishing pole?
Oh, this is gonna be great!
It's a fumble.
Davis picks it up for the Patriots, He's got a clear field Come on, come on, come on   Aw, come on, Diane.
It's a great game.
What're you do?
Now let's all check our watches.
Did we not promise to watch Frasier's show at 4:00?
All right, everybody see it?
Yeah.
All right, fine!
I'm not gonna play cat-and-mouse with a silly remote control box.
You know, all you people ever see of Frasier Crane is an ordinary Joe sitting at the bar being one of the guys.
You should see him in his mÃ©tier.
He's a brilliantly perceptive man.
Does anybody have a box that'll shut her up?
No, but I'd be glad to do it manually.
Oh!
Come on, you guys.
We made a promise.
Aw, Sammy!
Thank you, Sam.
First I'd like to introduce Dr. Frasier Crane.
Dr. Crane is an eminent psychiatrist here in the Boston area specializing in treatment of phobias.
Joining Dr. Crane in this discussion is Dr. Lilith Sternin.
Dr. Sternin is a member of the psychiatric staff at Boston General Hospital.
Welcome, Dr. Sternin.
Thank you.
Dr. Crane.
You really made her look beautiful, Diane.
Physician, heal thyself.
You've made many excellent points, Dr. Sternin.
How do you respond to them, Dr. Crane?
Dr. Crane?
Oh, excu What was the question?
Oh, uh, yes, of course.
Excuse me, uh Yes, my method of flooding, uh, seeks out the patient's, well, most sensitive and vulnerable spot in the defense system, and, uh penetrates probing deeper and deeper into the patient's psyche, thrusting over and over.
And thereby uncovering the reality behind the irrational fear.
Thank you, Dr. Crane.
Anything to add, Dr. Sternin?
Yes.
Uh : Although Dr. Crane's method is faster a slow and methodical approach can be much more rewarding.
Gentle stroking of the psyche will bring about a far more intense release of emotion building until the patient quite often will literally cry out in a release of satisfaction and joy.
: Point well taken.
This intellectual stuff's getting me all hot.
This is embarrassing.
We shouldn't be watching this.
Mm.
Well, maybe just a little while Yeah.
and that concludes this afternoon's program.
Aw!
Oh, no, no, hey.
Boo!
Come on!
Dr. Sternin, Dr. Crane, thank you for joining us.
Oh, excuse me.
For a written transcript of this afternoon's show, please send a self-addressed, stamped envelope to Psychology This Week, Box 84037, Boston, Massachusetts, What was that box number again?
Uh, 02205.
Hey, fellas, how was the fishing trip?
Geez.
It would have been a little better without Cliff's jabbering.
Guy catches one fish, turns into Ernest Hemingway.
Oh, congratulations, Cliff.
Thank you, Sammy.
Yeah, it was man against fish.
The rest of the world was shut out.
It was a good fish, a clean fish, a strong fish.
A little fish.
Get that stinking, slimy thing out of here.
And take your fish with you.
Oh, Frasier, I didn't expect to see you here.
Thought you'd be exchanging psychological positions with Dr. Sternin.
Please, Sam.
I made a complete fool of myself today and Dr. Sternin.
If they'd had a hose at the studio, they would have turned it on us.
Actually, that sounds kind of fun.
I'll never be able to look her in the eye again.
The only consolation is that nobody ever watches that show.
Way to go, sex machine!
I'm ruined.
Half of New England saw me today as a rutting pig.
Come on, Frasier.
You're not in rut, you're in love.
Oh, nonsense!
I don't think that because two people breathe heavily on a TV show is any cause for them to declare their undying love.
Breathe heavily?
I thought you were gonna suck in a chair there.
Listen, a TV station may not have been the best place in the world to sprout antlers, but it happened.
Go with it.
Dr. Sternin, you're back.
Diane, I'd like to thank you for your Pygmalion-like efforts.
I'd like to, but I can't, because they led to disaster.
Good evening, Dr. Crane.
Dr. Sternin.
It's, uh, nice to see you again.
And you.
I apologize for my overzealous behavior this afternoon.
And for making fools of us both.
Yes, well, I would also like to apologize for my completely unprofessional attitude, and I promise you that that sort of thing will never happen again.
Fine.
I've already penned a letter to the American Psychiatric Association apologizing for my behavior.
I would suggest that you do likewise.
Of course, of course.
And I think perhaps for the sake of our professional reputations, it's best we put this matter behind us and go on with our lives.
Oh.
That is probably wise.
You see, I've already lost three patients as a result of today's fiasco.
That's odd.
I picked up three.
While we're on the subject, Dr. Crane, I suggest that your behavior indicates an unacceptable level of sexual frustration.
You strike me as a man who needs professional help.
Or perhaps a girlfriend.
And you strike me as a woman who could use a good cuffing.
Good day, Dr. Crane.
Good day, Dr. Sternin.
Uh, just a moment, Dr. Sternin.
Um Sam, isn't the refrigerator door stuck again?
I don't think so.
Oh, I think it is.
And we need a hairpin to open it up.
Dr. Sternin, could we borrow a hairpin?
I don't see how a hairpin will help.
Strangely enough, it does.
Oh, well, don't you see?
What these two people who are such geniuses at romance are trying to do is to get you to take your hair down, thinking that it will stimulate me like some sort of Pavlovian dog.
So, why don't you just oblige them, get this silliness over with so we can get on with our lives?
You mean like this?
Precisely.
You know what?
What?
I'm going to kiss you.
I'm going to kiss you hard, and I'm going to kiss you long.
But make no mistake about it, I am going to kiss you.
In fact, I'm going to kiss you like you've never  Yes, like that.
Now listen, Lilith, I think you and I have just been too articulate for words.
We talk and we talk, and what we really want to do is show how we feel.
I think, Dr. Crane Look, I don't care what you think!
We both want to be animals.
Now I'm going back to my tastefully decorated townhouse and prove it.
Well, I-I suggest you come with me.
I think I see what you're trying to do, Dr. Crane, and I just want you to know it worked.
Let's go.
Isn't it exciting to see the blush of new-found love on their faces?
Do you realize we've just seen the birth of a new ro Don't you have someplace to go?
Oh, yes.
The concert.
By myself.
I'll go.
And sure, I'll be alone, but I don't care.
Because I'm in love.
And no one who's truly in love can ever be alone.
And I know my fellow loves me.
He just doesn't know it yet.
So I'll go to this concert, listen to the music, and dream again of the day when he'll be sitting beside me, holding my hand, sharing the moment.
That's my dream, and mine alone.
And no one can Get her out of here!
I'll go.
Only if you really want to.
But this is not a date.
The fact that we sit together has nothing to do with anything.
We're gonna take separate cabs.
I will not talk to you during the intermission.
I'm not gonna take you anywhere afterwards, and we will not mention this ever again, okay?
Fine.
Okay.
Is that love, or what?
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
Yeah, it says here there's another sighting of the Loch Ness monster.
Yeah?
Do you believe that?
There's even a picture of him.
Whoa!
Looks kind of like President Reagan.
That is Reagan.
The other picture's the monster.
Oh, I see.
Wonder if they'll ever catch that thing, huh?
Well, I, for one, hope they never do.
I mean, none of us really want to see that poor beast hauled out of the water and put on display in some sideshow.
Well, I sure would.
You know, we could all go together.
I don't mind driving.
Yeah, but, uh, you see, Woody, they You know, it'd be kind of fun.
We could pack a lunch.
No, Woody, they All right, who wants peanut butter and jelly and who wants bologna?
Woody, they I'll have one of each, all right?
Making your way in the world today Takes everything you've got Taking a break from all your worries Sure would help a lot Wouldn't you like to get away Sometimes you want to go Where everybody knows your name And they're always glad you came You want to be where you can see Our troubles are all the same You want to be where everybody knows your name You want to go where people know People are all the same You want to go where everybody knows your name.
Hey, Carla, how's that house-hunting going, huh?
Does that answer your question?
Yes, very nicely.
Boy, I'll tell you, it's hopeless.
I've looked everywhere in the Boston area, and I just cannot find a house in my price range.
After scrimping and saving for years, I think I got finally enough set aside for a little place, and find out I ain't got squat.
Well, what's the big rush?
Your apartment's fine.
No, it's not.
My kids get bigger, my apartment gets smaller.
I don't know what it's like to be alone in a bathroom anymore.
What's it like, Sam?
Is it everything people say it is?
More.
Much, much more.
I knew it.
Hello, everyone.
Hi.
Sam, I happen to be free tonight.
If a certain gentleman should come to knock on my door, say, about 7:30, I wouldn't be adverse to going out.
I sure hope you get lucky.
Because I did; I got myself a hot date tonight.
I see what you're doing.
Even though I eventually agreed to marry you, you're still smarting from the sting of my initial rejection and looking for ways to punish me.
No, I'm not going out with other women to punish you.
That's just one of the perks.
If you're trying to make me jealous, you can stop.
I want you to date these women.
While they may look better in leotards-- then again, they may not-- they can't compare to the total package you've experienced with me.
Oh, I see-- we're talking brains.
Listen, I'll have you know that Tiffany happens to be a very exceptional young woman.
Ah, yes, Tiffany-- the girl with the IQ of a lamp.
Let me describe her for you: spandex wardrobe.
Spends all of her time in a gym.
Breasts that would provide shade for a small boy.
You, you're not even close.
You, you're so far from being close.
She makes me crazy.
Did you hear that?
Yup.
Hi, can I speak to Tiffany, please?
I don't know; try the aerobics class.
Yeah, yeah, will you just tell her that Sam can't make it tonight.
Uh, something's upset his stomach.
Yeah, thank you.
Whew.
Boy.
Got to be somebody in here with a brain.
I mean, I don't even care if she's good-looking.
You got a sister, Frasier?
No.
You have a dress?
What's the occasion?
Hey, tutti-frutti and a rooti.
Oh, boy, a good and gracious afternoon to every one of you wonderful people.
Oh, Cliffie, cheer up, bud.
Eh, Normie, I'm a happy man.
I started a new route today.
So, where is it?
Uh, Meadowview Acres.
You know, just north of the airport?
It's a real plum.
Yeah, best route in the city.
No one else wanted it, huh?
Are you kidding?
It's a nesting ground for stewardesses out there.
Yeah, there's a house full of them, you know, living all together.
And they're nuts about me.
Well, how do you know that, Mr. Clavin?
Woody, they stand behind the curtain, laughing and giggling the way women do when they're taken with a man.
Have a couple of drafts, Woody?
Oh, hey, Carla, listen, if you're still, uh, searching out a new house, uh, I got a doozy out there on my route.
I wrote out the, uh, particulars.
Give me this.
"Meadowview Acres".
I know where that is.
I couldn't afford Hey, this thing is in my price range which means it is either built on quicksand, or is currently on fire.
Look, Carla, I looked at it and it looked all right to me.
Come on, Carla, check it out.
What do you got to lose?
You really think I should?
Yeah, remember what your horoscope said today?
"Take a chance, explore other avenues".
That's right!
And you know what?
That jives with my other two horoscopes, my tarot cards, and Madame Livinda's latest palm reading.
Well, there you go.
I think I better go give this thing a look-see.
I'll be back later.
Yeah, bye-bye.
Okay.
Hey, Mr. Peterson, I'm a Leo.
What's my horoscope say?
Young bartender should refill mug of thirsty patron at corner of bar.
Those things are so vague, they could apply to anyone.
Sammy!
Sammy!
Listen, I went to see that house, and it was perfect.
I mean, listen to this.
Me and the older kids could have rooms of our own.
Oh-ho!
And there's this big kitchen with Formica as far as the eye could see.
And there's grass, Sammy.
I mean, can you imagine having grass of your very own to water and mow and lie down in naked anytime you want.
That's the American dream, all right.
Yeah.
Oh, oh, oh-- there's a fireplace.
Finally the kids are going to have a place where they're supposed to start a fire.
I'm so excited, I don't know what to do.
Carla, you're talking like you've already bought the place.
I did.
You what?
I bought it!
I did!
They took my first offer.
Went through without a hitch.
Your very first offer?
Yeah, yeah, they could see I'd be a tough negotiator and buckled under.
Well, when do you move in?
In a few weeks.
I got to wait for the loan to clear, but the guy at the bank said not to worry, so I'm not going to.
Life is too wonderful to worry.
Thank you.
Carla, Carla, don't you think there's somebody else you ought to say something to?
Oh.
Cliff.
Stop.
Don't move.
Don't turn around.
Don't say anything.
Just look at the floor.
Huh?
Just do as I said.
Cliff, I want to thank you for telling me about the house.
You're welcome.
Oh, puke.
I knew you'd get mushy.
I see the search for intelligent forms of life continues.
Do you mind?
You're in my light.
I am your light.
Happy hunting.
Uh-huh.
Evening, everybody.
Norm!
What's shakin', Mr. Peterson?
What isn't?
Hey, there, Norm.
Carla bought that house I told her about.
And she knew its history?
What, what do you mean?
Well, the asking price just seemed a little low for that area, so I did a little checking on my own.
Oh, no.
I don't think I want to hear this.
Yeah, apparently, the house is built directly over the graveyard of a 17th-century prison.
Oh, my God!
It wasn't exactly a white-collar prison, either.
The worst murderers and cutthroats of their time.
They executed hundreds of them.
Local legend has it that they're going to rise from the grave and seek revenge on whoever dares to live there.
Well, we all know how superstitious Carla is.
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God, oh, God!
What's with him?
He, uh, forgot his dry cleaning.
Let me have a scotch and an Irish coffee.
I guess she doesn't know about it, huh?
Of course she doesn't know.
Would you buy a house that had that kind of history?
Houses have karmas.
Look at her; she's so happy.
But she has a right to know.
Well, I don't know.
It's always dangerous to mess with Carla, but especially when she's happy.
It's like when, uh, Frankenstein was playing with the little girl, you know?
It was a bad time to go up to him with a torch.
Yes, it's a terrible time; a terrible, terrible time.
I don't know; I think Diane's right.
I think we should tell her.
Maybe it's not too late to do something about it.
Hey, Carla?
Yeah, Sam?
I got something to tell you about the house.
Something not great.
I knew it.
Carla Tortelli, when will you ever learn?
After all these years of heartbreak, you still get your hopes up.
Okay, get it over with.
What's wrong with it?
Diane?
Carla, your house is built over a 17th-century prison graveyard.
That's it?
Mm-hmm.
Thank God!
I thought you were gonna say it had dry rot.
Dry?
Oh, no problem.
So, how's the new homeowner, huh?
Fine.
Just great.
Well, are you still living out of those cardboard boxes?
Yeah, you know how it is.
You know, Carla, I really admire you.
It took such courage to overlook the unhallowed ground on which your house is built.
I know I would've had my last earthly moment of rest in that house the moment I moved in.
Why, I could no more close my eyes in that cauldron of blood than sever my own arm.
Hey, Diane Oh, yes, well Angels on your pillow.
You know, I get this feeling in my gut that something's bothering Carla.
I'm going to find out what it is.
Hey, uh, so, Carla, how's the house?
It's a great house!
It's a wonderful house!
It's the best house in the world!
: Ooh!
What's the matter?
Nothing.
Did you find a problem after you moved in?
No 'cause I haven't actually moved in yet.
So you are bothered by the house's history?
Of course I'm bothered by it.
I saw Poltergeist.
Do you think I want to end up in the TV?
I just didn't say anything before 'cause I didn't want anyone to know I was scared.
Sammy, there's something evil in that house, something cold and clammy and horrible.
It doesn't want me there.
Carla, I've had phobias before, and I've found that the first essential step in overcoming one is to confront it.
I'll bet if you spent one night, God help you, in that house your fears would be licked.
Hey.
You're not going to let anything stand in the way of your dreams, are you?
No, I'm not.
I've never been a quitter.
I'm going to spend tonight in that house.
Good for you, Carla.
Damn right!
I'm going to conquer this thing.
I'm not going to let any demons from the other world deny me my house.
Last chance to stop me.
Only ten more hours to go.
What are you two ding-a-lings doing here?
Well, uh, we, uh, come to spend the night.
And, uh I brought you a little pizza with anchovies.
I hate anchovies.
Yeah, me, too.
Then let's eat, huh?
Hey, you know, this is a, uh, nice place, Carla.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah, hey, look.
Great fireplace here, Normie.
Yeah.
Super living room.
Hey, you know, with a, uh, little fresh paint and some new wallpaper you'll have some, uh fresh paint and new wallpaper.
Look, I appreciate what you guys are trying to do, but it's not necessary.
I'm fine.
Oh, sure, you're fine.
It's a terrific place, Carla.
It's got a really nice feeling in here.
It's, uh, warm and cozy.
Have you checked out the rest of the place yet?
No, I thought it might be a good idea to have a beer first.
Yeah, I find that pretty much applies to just about everything.
What was that?
Hound from hell.
No, no, no, no.
That's, a that was a Dalmatian.
I'd say probably six, seven years old.
Definitely neutered.
Yep I've, uh, never been bitten by that breed, but, uh  What was that?
It was the telephone.
Keep an eye on Indiana Jones here, huh?
I do not have a good feeling about this place, Cliff.
All right, Normie, look, I said we're going to stick it out, and that's exactly what we're going to do, eh?
All right, if the going gets tough, you can count on Norm Peterson.
Well, that was Sam.
Vera called.
She wants you to come home.
Yep.
I'm out of here.
Norm, Norm, come on!
I mean, since when are you in such a rush to get home to Vera?
Since you moved in over a graveyard, Carla.
Guys, look, I-I'm sorry.
I just I don't know.
Scary stuff just scares me.
Hey, hey, Normie, you're driving!
Well, guess it's, uh just the two of us, huh?
Yep.
You can take off, too, you know.
There's nothing keeping you here.
Yeah, no, I know.
Oh I love that song.
Gee, I went to a lot of dances in high school.
You were a dancer?
No, no, I was on the, uh, decorating committee.
I still have crepe paper stains on my fingers.
Yeah, I remember, you know, watching all those kids out there having one hell of a time, and I thought, "Boy, I'd love to be out there with them," but I could never find a partner to practice with.
Fascinating.
Hey, hey, hey, keep your grubby fingers off my piece there.
Hey, Carla, you know something?
This is the, uh, first time we've ever been alone together.
Please, I'm eating.
Can I ask you a question?
Who's stopping you?
How come you're always getting on me?
Is it my fault you're such a yutz?
And as long as we're asking questions, what are you doing here tonight?
Well, having a little beer and a little pizza, and, uh helping a friend through a scary night.
You think I'm scared?
I'm not scared.
No, Carla it's nothing to be ashamed of.
Remember what, uh, Ernest Hemingway said Would you shut up?
No, I think that was Jack London.
Look, Carla, I feel a little responsible for getting you into this, and I just thought you needed, uh, somebody to be here with you.
I don't need anybody, least of all you.
All right.
Fine.
Cliff?
You know, uh I taught a couple of guys to dance in my day.
So?
So nothing.
First rule: no stepping on the teacher's feet.
Well, yes, ma'am.
Give me your hands.
Loosen up, would ya?
I don't bite.
Well, not you.
All right, rock, walk.
Rock don't bounce.
Rock, walk, rock, walk  There you go.
Hey!
Hey!
What was your leg doing underneath my head?
I don't know.
Hey, I was asleep.
I, I, I didn't even enjoy it.
You better not have.
What, uh, what time is it?
It's 4:30 in the morning.
Whoo It's gonna be dawn soon.
Hey!
I did it!
I stayed here all night!
The spell is broken.
Thank you, Cliff.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Oh, I wonder how long she's been wanting to do that.
It's gonna be okay.
My luck is finally changing.
Hey, can you feel it?
Uh, feel what?
The house, it's different now.
It likes me.
It wants me.
You know what?
I think I'm gonna put the couch right over here.
And the oil painting of me and Elvis on that wall.
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
And the easy chair  What's that?
I don't know.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
They're coming to get us.
They're gonna drag us back down to the grave with them!
No, wait, no, Carla, know what that is?
It it's-it's not the dead coming out of the grave to feast on human flesh.
It's an L-1011 wide-body.
You know, the sounds are very similar.
Yeah.
And I understand that during foggy weather, they have to reroute those babies to runway two-niner.
It must be near here.
Do you mean that this house, my house, is at the end of a runway?
: Uh-huh.
And that was a wide-body jet landing ten feet from my backyard?
: Yeah.
And this house is not cheap because it's haunted, but because it is right next to the airport?
Yeah.
I'm home!
Yay!
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
Boy, did I have a crazy dream last night.
What was it?
I was at this party with a bunch of strangers.
The food was great.
The music was loud.
All of a sudden, everybody in the place stopped and was lookin' at me, and I realized that I wasn't wearing any pants.
Oh, yes, yes.
I've had that dream a million times.
Yeah, me, too, and boy, is it ever embarrassing, huh?
Why is that?
Uh uh, Norm?
Never embarrassed me.
Tell you the one I hate.
You know, you're back in college, right?
And you haven't been to class the entire semester, and the teacher's about to give the final exam.
Oh, yeah, that one's the worst.
What're you talkin' about, Carla?
You never went to college.
It's a dream, stupid.
Well, how about the one where you go to this fancy restaurant, and before they let you in, they make you leave your legs at the door?
Then the girl gives you claim check number six.
So you go in, but instead of food, everyone's eatin' their silverware.
Only you can't really enjoy your fork because you're so worried that whoever got claim check number nine might finish first and pick up your legs by mistake.
Yeah, oh, yeah.
Making your way in the world today Takes everything you've got Taking a break from all your worries Sure would help a lot Wouldn't you like to get away Sometimes you want to go Ã¢â¢Âª Where everybody knows your name Ã¢â¢Âª Ã¢â¢Âª And they're always glad you came Ã¢â¢Âª You want to be where you can see Our troubles are all the same You want to be where everybody knows your name You want to go where people know People are all the same You want to go where everybody knows your name.
Two vodka martinis and a Wallbanger.
Wallbanger!
Sam, I need to ask a big favor.
All right, as long as it doesn't interfere with your job.
Okay, then, I need to ask a huge favor.
Would it be possible two weeks from this coming Wednesday for me to leave work early about ten minutes?
Sure, why not?
Oh, thank you, Sam.
Thank you very much.
And thank you for not prying further into the matter.
Especially since, well, I've no valid excuse for my early departure.
Sam, I must be frank.
Sounds good.
I'll be Bob.
I mean, it's not as if I had a dental appointment or had to pick up some relative at the airport.
Okay, Diane, why do you have to leave early two weeks from this Wednesday?
Well, if you must know I have a date.
Oh, yeah, I've heard of those.
Have fun.
Oh, sweet transparent bravado.
Could there be a soul dearer than the little boy lost, trembling on the edge of despair, yet struggling manfully to maintain his stiff upper lip?
Thank you for noticing.
Oh, wait, Sam, wait.
One more thing.
What?
After our five-star-dinner- and-season-premiere- of-the-ballet date, Chad-- Dr. Stark, may desire a kiss.
Would you mind-- should he ask-- if I let his lips touch mine?
Touch your what?
Oh, Mr. Peterson, I forgot.
Some guy dropped by earlier and asked me to give this to you.
Oh, thank you, Woody.
And thank you, God!
Oh, well, what's that, Normie?
A research grant from the National Beer Foundation?
No, Cliffie, just a measly little pair of sky-view seats for the Sox-Yankee doubleheader tomorrow.
Whoa, you're kidding me!
I pulled every string I had and I could only score standing room.
Come on.
How'd you get that?
Sammy, it's not who you know, it's who I know, all right?
Yeah.
A client friend of mine, Jerry Donahue, sent those babies over to thank me for being such a fantastic financial counselor.
No, seriously, how'd you get 'em?
I'm tellin' you, I saved the guy a bundle on his taxes last year.
He asked me to invest his windfall, you know?
And in the space of six short months, I kinda doubled his money.
We got lucky on a little convenience mart in Worcester.
What'd you do?
Hold it up?
You guys are hilarious.
But Jerry's laughing all the way to the bank, all right?
I diversified the guy.
We went into, uh, mutuals, and a very pretty little biotech company that just went public.
Boy, sounds like you got the Midas touch there.
You should hear some of the other great ideas we have cooked up.
Yeah?
Like what?
Mm no, no, sorry, guys.
My lips are sealed.
Buy you a beer.
It's called "Tan 'N Wash".
Tan and wash, guys.
The ultimate marriage of luxury and convenience.
A combination tanning salon and coin-operated laundry.
Get real.
Come on.
The timing's right on this.
Summer tans are fading.
Winter's coming.
It's always dirty clothes season.
It's gonna be the hottest place in town.
I'm glad you're already thinking about arson.
: Yeah, arson.
Don't listen to them, Norman.
And never be deterred by the mindless jibes of the ignorant masses.
Those ignorant masses are gonna be our customers.
Hey, I'll be there will bells on.
Everyone'll be there, buddy, fluffing, folding, relaxing happily beneath the healthful rays of a federally approved UVA bronzing unit.
Well, Normie, I gotta say it's the silliest, most harebrained scheme I've ever heard of.
Yeah.
Well, I gotta go.
: Normie, walk me out.
I'm not leaving yet, Cliff.
Neither am I. Ma and I want in.
In where?
Don't be naive, Normie.
Put me up for five shares.
No, no, no.
Investments are risky, Cliff.
Look, I never do business with friends, all right?
Besides, it's 200 bucks a share.
Put me down for five, too, will ya?
Oh, great, Norm, now the cat's outta the bag!
I think you're all crazy.
But if Clavin makes big bucks and I don't, I won't be able to live with the shame.
Give me a share.
Oh, me, too!
Me, too!
You, Diane?
Laying bets on a laundry?
Well, in my case, it's not a gamble, but rather a show of faith in our great free enterprise system.
Yes, even Diane Chambers is not immune to the renaissance of American patriotism in the 1980s.
Although I hasten to remind you this does not imply any shifting of my support toward the current administration.
I hope nobody was looking for a silent partner.
You know, Diane, you shouldn't be investin' in a tanning salon.
You oughta be usin' one.
You got skin the color of Elmer's glue.
I happen to have what Restoration poets refer to as "alabaster skin".
Well, at least your hair looks nice.
Besides, with my rendezvous with Chad coming up, I dare not risk freckling.
Why not?
If it got boring, you could always play connect-the-dots.
God, how this must torment you.
No, no, no, come on, Norm.
You gonna let us in or not?
Let's just change the subject, all right?
Hey, he's tryin' to sidetrack us.
This thing must be a gold mine.
Yeah, yeah, hey, Normie, uh, correct me if I'm wrong, but yesterday you had a letter you needed mailed.
I did it, and you can at least return the favor.
Cliffie, that's your job.
Well, all right.
Then, as one professional to another-- come on, Norm!
I know what's gonna happen!
I know what's gonna happen.
Somethin's gonna go wrong and you're all gonna blame me.
All right, well, well.
All right, yes!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Hey, Wood, do you want in?
I don't think so.
You know, when I left home, my father gave me some very sound advice.
"Never trust a man who can't look ya in the eye.
"Never talk when you can listen.
"And never spend venture capital on a limited partnership without a detailed, analytical fiduciary prospectus".
Afternoon, everybody.
Norm!
Hey, Norm, how's the world been treatin' ya?
Like a baby treats a diaper.
So what's the deal with the, uh, "Tan 'N Wash"?
For a new business, I'd say Tan 'N Wash is doing as well as could be expected.
Oh, yeah?
I dropped by this morning and the only customer in the place was a lonely woman kicking the hell out of a jammed change machine.
Oh, come on.
By the way, you owe me a quarter and a new pair of shoes.
Patience, Carla, all right?
Patience.
There are gray skies on the horizon.
Yeah, it's gonna get cold and damp and miserable.
We'll be wading in customers.
Yeah, I think we're wading in something right now.
I've worked out a great new promotional campaign.
Promotional campaign?
Yeah.
Whew!
Hey, hey!
Check out Mr. Tan there, huh?
Say, Sammy, did you just fly to the tropics and spend a week and thousands of dollars under the blazing, unhealthy sun?
No, no, Norm.
No, I just spent my lunch hour under some healthful, federally approved UVA rays at the Tan 'N Wash.
Say, those clothes are really lookin' clean there, pal.
Well, thank you, Norm.
Yeah.
Now is it true that with these coupons anyone can get 25% off on their first five visits?
Well, that's what I hear.
Great.
Well!
Hey I tell ya, is that Cliff Clavin or is that Don Ho, huh?
Uh Where ya been, buddy, some, uh, faraway island resort?
Oh, easy mistake, Norm, but, no, I got this tan right here in Beantown.
Is that at the new Tan 'N Wash I've been hearing so danged much about?
That's right, Normie.
And, by the way, did you realize that the tan first gained popularity in what is now known as the Bronze Age?
Great, great.
Well, I'm sold.
Oh, and, by the way, look how white I used to be.
You wore your socks in the tanning booth?
Well, I, I gotta be careful, Sammy.
The Clavin men have, uh, feet like a baby's bottom.
With faces to match.
Will you back off, Carla?
I don't see you pitchin' in for the cause here.
Yeah, yeah?
Well, all I know is I wouldn't stick a fork in a toaster, never mind my valuables.
Come on, guys.
Uh, whatta you say we snap up these flyers?
They can't last forever.
Wouldn't be so sure, Norm.
You know, Peterson, you've got the guts of a burglar.
In here peddling a tanning salon on the sunniest day of the year.
Outside of someone with a financial interest in the place, who'd be stupid enough to spend a minute in your rip-off joint?
You try to help out a few newly enterprising friends and what do you get for your trouble?
Sit.
Keep it down, will ya?
Keep it down here.
Keep it down?
I've got the worst sunburn of my life, thanks to a faulty thermo-regulator on tanning machine number three, the Bahama Mama.
Frasier, you're supposed to start off slowly, all right?
But I must say, you do have one heck of a fantastic base coat there, Fras.
Yeah.
Yeah, and your, uh, your shirt sure smells fresher.
Really?
It's not too lemony?
Not for you.
Sorry.
Well, it's just that it's such a lovely, sunny day out as your tanned faces will attest.
Well, I guess I'm feeling especially girlish.
How come, Miss Chambers?
Nah, nah, nah, don't, don't.
You know, Woody-- the usual thing that puts a bounce in a girl's step.
Ah!
Support hose.
You're adorable.
No, I'm referring to a very special evening.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Didn't you have a date or something last night?
You know perfectly well I saw Chad, but-- it was no big deal.
Yeah.
I refuse to ask her about last night.
You ask her, Woody.
Gotcha.
Well, looky here.
The paper predicts the same high for Boston as Honolulu.
That is Honolulu, Hawaii, the state where you can get a free tan all year round.
Carla, if you're trying to say something, why don't you just spit it out, all right?
Tan 'N' Wash bites it.
Okay, I'll admit Indian summer's killing us temporarily, but this is Boston.
It's gonna get cold.
Hey, Sam.
I found out all about Miss Chambers' date.
I mean, uh beautiful night of magic.
Just spill it, will ya, Woody?
Well, the ballet was exquisite, but it paled by comparison to the enchanting coach ride under the stars.
Chad held her porcelain - like hand lightly, tracing tiny circles on her alamander Alabaster.
alabaster skin, and then, fearing that the spell might be broken, she invited him up to her pied-de-teer for some quiet conversation and warm brandy, and then What?
Miss Chambers said if you want to hear the rest, you gotta ask her yourself.
Oh Forget it!
Forget it, man!
Oh, ask her, Sam.
Sounds like you won't be disappointed.
Forget it.
Frasier, a sunburn?
No, I'm doing my impression of a blood blister.
Hey, Frasier.
You know, there's something I've always been meaning to ask you.
What was your reaction the first time you saw Diane naked?
Normie, I can't hold out any longer.
Ma's getting antsy.
The last time she spent a thousand dollars was on a house.
Cliff, I'm sorry.
I-I really am, but you guys begged me to let ya in.
It's not like I didn't warn you.
Oh, sure.
"Don't do this.
I pray to God you don't do this".
You call that a warning?
You know, I predicted this.
You guys are nervous Nellies and you're trying to blame it all on me.
I want out, Norm.
Yeah, me, too.
Who wants a tan in the winter anyway?
Wait, wait.
This is not the smart move.
You gotta hang in there.
You gotta roll with the punches, all right?
You're gonna roll with the punches if you don't get us outta this.
Nah, I just don't think that we're cut out for it.
No.
Apparently not, all right?
Yeah, geez, have it your way, guys, okay?
Look, all right, I tell ya what.
Okay?
I'll personally buy out your shares, all right?
I'll have your checks in the mail within a week.
Stupid mistake.
Stupid.
Stupid.
Ooh, ooh, boy.
It's still snowing out there.
Yeah, and every flake means another buck in Norm's pocket.
You, you guys still moaning because Norm hit the jackpot and you didn't?
Hey, come on, Paul, give us some credit for being adults, huh?
Hey, what do you say we toilet paper his house?
Nah, it'd only make it look better.
Sam, excuse me.
May I have your ear for a moment?
Sure.
Just don't leave any bite marks.
Sam, I've decided to break off my relationship with Chad.
Who?
What an actor you are.
You know, if you hadn't chosen bartending, you could well have had a career in the theater.
Or as a model.
Anyway, you needn't continue this charade of nonchalance.
I'm ending my affaire de coeur because I can sense how it's secretly gnawing away at you.
Okay.
all right.
I'm glad.
All I've been able to think about is you and Chad.
In your apartment.
In his car, on the stairs.
Doing things even we never did.
I mean, I can't eat, I can't sleep.
Oh, Sam.
Really?
Gee, maybe I could have been an actor.
Oh!
Afternoon, everybody.
Norm!
Norman.
How're you feeling today, Norm?
Rich and thirsty.
Pour me a beer.
Yes, sir, Mr. Peterson.
Boy, you sure have gotten successful, huh?
Well, Woody, you know what they say about success.
It's one percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration.
So is your shirt.
Yeah, and you know what else they say about success there, Mr. Rockeflounder?
It's lonely at the top.
Yeah, but the food's better, Cliff.
Hey, you don't have to rub our noses in it, man.
I mean, we're your friends, after all.
Friends?
You call yourselves friends?
The last four or five times I've walked in here, you treat me as if I've done something wrong.
You know, not one of you guys has bothered to congratulate me for my success.
Which, I might add, you all had a chance to share in.
Maybe I should just take my refreshment business elsewhere.
When I think of all the hours I wasted in here when I could have been wasting them somewhere else.
Norman, Norman.
Please don't leave.
We're taking it out on you, but we're really mad at ourselves.
The hostility you're feeling is for our own stupidity at bailing out of this project.
Right, everyone?
You guys are beautiful.
Oh, well, come on, wait a second.
Come on back here.
Yeah, we've been actin' like creeps, Normie.
I'll fluff up your favorite stool.
Yeah, I'll open a fresh bag of pretzels.
And I'll pour you a beer just the way you like it-- within reach.
What we're trying to say here is, we're sorry.
Yeah.
You had the guts to stick it out, and we didn't, and you deserve all the success now.
Thank you, Sam.
Guys.
I'm really glad to hear that because, uh, I have a little surprise for you guys.
I never took you out of Tan 'N' Wash at all.
And here are your first dividend checks right here, huh?
Oh, Norman!
You're kidding me.
?
For he's a jolly good fellow ?
For he's a jolly good fellow, ?
For he's a jolly good fellow, ?
Cheers.
It's for you.
Put 'em on hold.
Which nobody can deny.
Hey.
All right.
This is great.
Hey, look at that!
It's snowing even harder out now.
Oh, it's a harbinger of good fortune!
You said it, bone butt!
Snow today means dough tomorrow.
Hey, let's carry Mr. Peterson around the bar on our shoulders and then go play in the snow.
Let's go play in the snow.
Hold it!
Hold it!
Last one out's a Clavin.
No, you're not.
You're not gonna get me this time.
Oh, I'm always the Clavin.
Ah, Woody.
Woody, Woody, Woody.
Look at them, huh?
Isn't that great?
They're singin' and dancin'.
It gives me a great feeling all over to do something good for those people.
Oh, speaking of people, you got one on hold here.
Hello.
Yeah, hi.
Oh, no.
No.
No, get out.
No!
What're you?
No, man, no!
No Well, at least we No?
!
We, no, but wait a, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Bad news, Mr. Peterson?
Wrong number, Woody.
Aren't those annoying?
Uh Huh!
Guys!
Good friends!
Listen, people, uh, excuse me!
Listen, I know things have been going just beautifully, but, uh, hey, would you stop jumping up and down for a second?
!
Thank you.
Now let's just take a hypothetical situation.
Just for fun, let's just say that the roof collapsed over at Tan 'N' Wash from the weight of all this snow and by some little quirk we didn't have any insurance.
How would you guys feel about that, huh?
Just checking.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
Why don't you wait?
I'll get our coats.
Mm.
Okay?
Hope to see you again soon.
Thank you, Miss.
Oh, great.
I can't even read that check.
Well, I'm so sorry if my handwriting isn't up to your high and mighty standards, but some of us don't get to sit around on our buns all day and practice our penmanship.
Some of us have to go out and earn a living!
Here are your glasses, dear.
You left them in your coat again.
Oh, thanks.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Let's go.
Oh, hey, um I'm really sorry.
I-I I don't know what to say, except I had a really bad day.
Oh yeah, sure, Carla, bad day.
Bad life is more like it.
House full of kids, this crummy job.
If I keep treatin' my customers this way, I'm going to lose even that.
Uh, uh, here you go.
I hope things'll start looking up.
Oh, no, no, no, no, I couldn't, I couldn't.
Not the way I treated you.
No, please, please, please, we insist.
Ten bucks?
Excuse me, Miss.
You forgot to, uh, give me a napkin.
I'm so sorry!
I don't know what to say, except I've had a really bad day.
Bad day?
Bad life is more like it.
A house full of kids  Ã¢â¢Âª Making your way in the world today Ã¢â¢Âª Takes everything you've got Taking a break from all your worries Sure would help a lot Wouldn't you like to get away Sometimes you want to go Where everybody knows your name And they're always glad you came You want to be where you can see Our troubles are all the same You want to be where everybody knows your name You want to go where people know People are all the same You want to go where everybody knows your name.
Yep!
Hey, everybody, guess what?
Today marks the beginning of my seventh year as a U.S. postal carrier.
Well, all right.
Woody, I think that calls for a little drink on the house.
What do you think, huh?
I think you're right, Mr. Peterson.
Yeah?
Hey, what the hell, give Cliffie one, too.
Hey This guy, huh?
Oh, yeah, imagine that.
Seven years carrying the old bag around.
Yeah, I know the feeling.
That's, uh that's quite an achievement, though, Cliffie.
Oh, yeah?
Look who's talkin'.
Oh, okay, all right.
I know some people around here don't exactly think that I'm an overachiever, but, uh I'll tell you, I don't plan to go to my grave until I've made some sort of impression on this world.
I'd say you've already made a deep one.
You know, I plan on leavin' somethin' behind for the world to remember me by.
Yeah?
And here it is.
It's a glass of Windex, Woody.
No, it's a drink.
And Woody Boyd is going to become the next Jim Sheehan.
Who?
Certainly you've heard of the inventor of the Fish House Punch?
I can't say we have, Wood, but then again, we don't get out that much, you know?
Well, I'm callin' mine the Blue Boyd of Happiness.
Can I tempt you?
Not bad.
Really.
Oh, hey, that's delicious.
Now all I got to do is fill out these forms and register with Bartender's Monthly Magazine, and my name will be a household word.
Yeah: doorknob.
Hey, Sam, you want to try my new drink?
Woody, I can't touch that stuff.
I'm an alcoholic.
You are?
Oh, I I'm sorry.
I-I thought you knew.
Yeah, I drank myself out of baseball and out of a marriage.
Gee, that's hard to believe.
Well, it's true.
Right, gang?
Yeah Guy had a face full of booze No, no, no, I believe you were a drunk, Sam.
I just didn't know you'd been married.
Mmm, pretty good Blue Moon.
You mean it's already a drink?
Aw, don't feel disappointed there, Woody.
Every combination in the world's been done to death by now.
You couldn't possibly invent anything new.
Hello, Cheers.
Hey, Woody, gin and tonic.
Oh, uh, somebody's already invented that.
No, you horseshoe, I'm ordering one.
Oh, no!
Really?
Tonight?
Oh!
Oh, I can't wait!
Yes, thank you.
Oh!
I have the most exciting news, everyone.
Tonight I am eating dinner at The Cafe.
Ah, gee, that's pretty exciting.
Tonight I'm driving home in The Car.
No, you see, um actually, Sam, The Cafe is one of the trendiest restaurants.
Eating there is considered, uh, to be rather a coup among certain, oh self-important and pretentious circles.
Congratulations, Diane.
If this place is so hot, how come they can't think of a better name than The Cafe?
Oh, Carla, if you had any sense of style, you would know that a simple name connotes the very best of taste.
Hey, you're right about that, Diane.
There's this joint out on Route One called "Eat".
Don't miss it.
It's great.
Say, you know, Darlene and I can't make up our mind whether to have some chili or a hamburger.
Maybe this Cafe joint sounds just like the ticket.
Well, you got the number there?
What?
What's the number?
What?
Pardonne mon laughteur, Sam.
This is not the sort of place you just call and make a reservation.
My dinner companion is a Brundage, and even with that pull, he had to wait three months for a table.
Ooh, geez, I wonder how long he had to wait for the chairs.
Look what I'm dealing with.
You consider food as a fuel to be salted down heavily, covered with ketchup, stuffed in your mouth, and on a good day, chewed.
What I'm trying to say is, Sam, you couldn't possibly get a reservation at this late hour.
Diane, I can get a reservation in any restaurant I want.
The name "Sam Malone" still carries a little clout in this town.
Right.
Hey, hey, hey.
Very well, Sam.
Let's give it a try.
Allow me to call The Cafe.
Well, now, li-lis I'm not even sure I want to go there.
Afraid, Sam?
They have not built the restaurant that can scare me.
Come on.
Um, yes, hold on, please.
Um, hello, uh, I'd like to make a reservation, please.
Nothing tonight?
Well, this happens to be Sam "Mayday" Malone, formerly of the Red Sox.
Well, yeah, that'll be fine.
Thank you very much.
Hey, all right, Sammy.
You got it, huh?
Sure did.
When, next March?
No, next February.
Well done, Sam.
God, I hate it when she's right.
Ah, you didn't want to eat there anyway, Sam.
The waiters pride themselves on rudeness, the portions are too small, and it's exorbitantly overpriced.
Oh, you couldn't get in either, huh?
Not till April.
Well, I certainly hope Diane had a big lunch.
Hi, I'd like to, uh, cancel a reservation for tonight, please.
The name is Brundage.
Party of two.
Yes, that Brundage.
Thank you.
Uh-uh, uh-uh, Sammy.
Canceling Diane's reservation?
Ooh, heart of stone.
I love it.
Yeah, hi, this is, uh, Sam Malone again.
I'm just wondering if you might've had a surprise cancellation for tonight.
What do you mean, you don't?
You must have.
I just No, no, n-never mind, never mind.
Boy, I'd sure love to waltz into that joint tonight just so I could see the look on her face.
Well, if it's that important to you, Sam, give me the phone.
If Julian Weinstein, my good friend, can't get you in, nobody can.
Ooh, the heart transplant wizard?
Oh, one and the same, yeah.
We went to prep school together.
He's a well-known gourmet.
Yeah, well, wh-why would he want to do this for me, though?
He'd love to do me a favor.
See, we dissected our first frog together.
Hello, Julian.
Julian, hi.
Frasier Crane.
How are you?
Crane.
C-R-A-N-E.
Yes, yes, Dr. Frasier Crane.
All right, fine.
Uh, listen, I was wondering what you know about, uh No, it's A-N-E!
Oh, skip it!
I'll tell you, you know, you open a few thoraxes, you forget who your friends are.
Oh, it's beautiful.
A feast for the eyes as well as the palate.
Ah, that must be our table.
Uh, the Brundage party.
Brundage?
Ah, Brundage.
You canceled.
That's impossible.
I-I made the reservations over three months ago.
Well, obviously, there's been some mistake.
The best we can do is give you the next available table.
And when might that be?
If all goes well, perhaps tonight.
Perhaps?
Jordan, don't make a fuss, please.
We'll straighten this out.
He's sorry.
Dr. Weinstein, your table is ready.
Excuse me, Miss.
I don't believe it.
Oh, neither do I. I was this close to Dr. Julian Weinstein.
That's not Julian Weinstein.
That's the man who stole our reservation.
That's not Julian Weinstein.
That's an imposter.
Ask him for his I.D. Ask him to spell I.D. Do you know how to order in a place like this?
Oh, yeah, yeah, my, uh, friend Frasier read a review about the menu.
He coached me.
No problem.
Dr. Weinstein.
Uh-uh, uh-uh.
You swine.
It's one thing to pretend to be somebody else on the phone, but convincing others that you're a sophisticated gourmet is a little bit more than you can handle.
You're going to blow it, Sam.
You're going to be embarrassed in front of some of the most important people in Boston.
And then you're going to slink out of here with your curly little swine tail between your legs.
You don't think I can handle this?
Well, just watch.
Excuse me, we'd like to start off with BouchÃ©es Parmentier au Fromage, followed by a salade maison, and for our entrÃ©e, we'll have Tourte Froide D'Anguille Rabelais.
Thank you so much.
Good, Sam; that was your busboy.
I knew that.
He's got lips.
He can tell the waiter, can't he?
Bon appetit, Dr. Weinstein.
Who's Miss Grumpus?
Excuse me, uh, you aren't, uh, Dr. Julian Weinstein, are you?
Uh yes.
This is really an honor.
I'm, I'm Dr. Peter Fisher.
Oh.
Uh, nice to meet you.
Yeah.
You know, I had no idea you were so young.
Well, I, uh, skipped a few grades in med school.
You got to have a sense of humor in this line of work.
Say, if you'll indulge in a little shop talk, uh, where did you come up with that concept of combining antithymocyte globulin with, uh, cyclosporin A to combat tissue rejection?
On the beach.
Nice meeting you.
Excuse me, Dr. Weinstein.
Oh, uh, yeah, here we go.
Our chef Claude would like to say hello.
He met you while he was a chef at La Ronde.
Do you mind?
Oh, uh well, actu-actually It won't take but a moment.
Maybe, uh Grab your purse.
We've got to get Dr. Weinstein, so good You're not Dr. Weinstein.
Yes, I am.
Perhaps you hadn't heard about my accident.
Why, no, I didn't.
Oh, yes, yes, uh terribly disfigured.
Uh, thank God for plastic surgery.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
But they've done a wonderful job.
Hmm You look much better.
And taller.
Traction.
It, uh Well, nice to see you again.
You, too.
Boy, you pulled it off.
Mm.
That's pretty smart.
Yeah, well, of course I'm smart.
I'm a doctor.
: Oh!
Right.
All right, whiskey, vermouth, bitters-- that's a Paddy Cocktail.
Gin, vermouth, grapefruit juice-- that's a Palm Beach.
Oh, wait a minute.
How about gin, vermouth and black coffee?
That's paint remover.
All right, I'll try something else.
Oh, great, I'm out of limes.
Don't panic.
Sam always keeps some extras around.
Where?
Call the doctor and find out.
Telephone for Dr. Weinstein.
Oh, um It's a Dr. Woody.
He's in the middle of surgery, and he says he needs your opinion.
Thank you.
Hello?
Wha-what?
You're out of them?
No, look, just, just check in the box right next to the scotch uh, tape.
The scotch tape.
We, uh Sometimes we run out of stitches and have to improvise.
Thank you, Dr. Woody.
Dr. Weinstein?
My date needs medical attention.
Can you help?
My food just arrived.
Well, I'm a doctor.
Sit down.
I-I want the world-famous heart surgeon, Dr. Julian Weinstein.
Well, of course; I bow to his greater skill.
No, no, no, uh, why don't you go ahead there, Fisher, and give him a shot?
He's having chest pains, Doctor!
Oh, well, uh, why don't you time them and see how far apart they are?
All right, I'll, uh, give him a look-see, I guess.
Right this way, Doctor.
Everything'll be all right.
Don't worry.
What are you doing?
You're ruining my dinner.
Ruining your dinner?
Ruining your dinner?
!
Everybody, now Sam, this is the cruelest thing you've ever done!
Yeah, what about the crummy thing you did to me earlier today, making me feel like a big nobody?
I apologize.
I spoke irrationally.
You're not a nobody.
Now, will you and your date kindly leave so that Jordan and I can have our rightful meal, and the two of you can sashay over to the Colonel's across the street?
Will you excuse me?
My meal is getting cold.
Now Well, we may have a long wait ahead of us, but we are going to stay until we get seated.
No, you're going to stay until you get seated.
Right about now a bucket of extra crispy doesn't sound half bad.
Okay, Dr. Crane, just drink up.
Woody, please, you promised you'd stop after the rum and trail mix.
That wasn't a drink.
That was just something to cleanse your palate.
Now come on, here.
My God, Woody!
That bad, huh?
No, no, it's terrific.
Here, try this.
I've never had anything like it.
All right!
Oh!
Oh, yeah!
This one gets you in the cocktail hall of fame!
So, what's in it, Wood?
Yeah, what's the secret recipe?
Well, it's, uh, two parts  Your change, Dr. Weinstein.
Ah, thank you very much.
Whew, boy, remember the good old days when you could spend $200 for a meal and then still have enough change to buy a mint patty?
Ah, Paul, memorable.
Aw, gee  Madam, we've had our last seating.
I'm afraid we won't be able to accommodate you this evening.
Oh, Paul, uh could I speak to you for a minute?
I'll meet you outside.
Listen, it, it would be a great personal favor to me, Dr. Julian Weinstein-- in fact, to the entire Weinstein family, and pretty much to doctors all over the world-- if if you could, uh, make sure she gets some food.
Well, uh, if you'll agree to honor us with your presence again, Dr. Weinstein, I'll see to it personally.
Well, I appreciate that.
Enjoy, Diane.
Thank you.
I intend to.
Thank you.
This will do nicely.
Would you like to hear our menu?
Thank you, no.
I've memorized it.
I'll have the Tournedos Rossini.
I'm sorry, we're all out of that.
Uh, then I'll have the Jambon Farci et Braise.
Once again, I'm sorry.
Let's attack this from another direction.
You tell me what you have left.
Fricadelles de veau a la Nicoise.
Great, I'm in a Fricadelle mood.
Hi.
What are you doing here?
Well, I'm still hungry, actually.
What happened to, uh, Darlene?
Oh, I put her in a cab and sent her home.
Well, you don't have to do me any favors.
No, I'm not doing you any favors.
I-I'm really hungry.
May I, uh, join you?
I don't care what you do.
Well, thank you.
Thank you, Sam.
You're welcome.
Doctor.
Ah, Paul.
Can I get you anything else?
Uh, what do you have?
Anything for you, Dr. Weinstein.
Ah, well You know, I just can't make up my mind.
Why don't you have my dear friend Claude mix me up something special?
Very good.
I really do appreciate your coming back, Sam.
It was sweet.
No, no, it's not sweet.
I I did it for myself.
I was feeling guilty out there, and I don't like to feel guilty.
Well, that's sweet in itself.
Well, we'll see how sweet you think it is when I have you pay for your own meal.
Madam.
Doctor.
Everything was delightful and well worth the wait.
Ooh, yes, I enjoyed it very much.
I'll be right with you.
Say, uh, I seem to be running a little short on cash.
You know, Sam, I think it was a really good idea you had about us going Dutch.
See, this way, we don't feel that we owe each other anything.
This is not funny.
This could be very embarrassing for both of us.
Please.
Why?
I've already paid for my meal, and I'm leaving.
Good night, Dr. Weinstein.
See you in surgery.
Hey, I'm serious.
Hey, come on, don't do this!
MAITRE D': Is there a problem, Doctor?
No, no, no problem at all.
Um I'll just use my credit card here.
Mm, very well.
Uh, Dr. Weinstein, this appears to be the credit card of a Mr. Sam Malone.
Let me see that.
Well, I'll be darned.
You know, I must have, uh, switched wallets with this Malone character.
You know, I bet it happened at the club.
Yes, it did; I remember him now.
A baseball player.
Malone.
You, uh, you ever heard of him?
No.
Oh, well, why don't you, uh, put it on this credit card anyway, and I'll take this Malone guy out to dinner some other time, hmm?
I'm afraid not.
Well, all right, I don't suppose you take a personal check, do you?
And whose name would be on that?
Okay, well, uh, why don't we try this, then?
Oh, my God, look at the size of that cat!
Hey, you, come back here!
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Hey, Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
Afternoon, Woody!
Oh, hiya, Mr. Twitchell.
If it isn't Walter Q. Twitchell, the man who put the "nie" in weenie.
You South Central Branch types are all alike-- wisenheimers.
Good Lord, Miss Agnes!
You're wearing your postal keychain and you're not on active duty?
Well That's a direct violation of postal regulations.
I'm filing a report on you.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
I'd love to see the supervisor's face when he calls me out on the mat and I whip out this little baby.
Heh?
Care to take a peep at the old French peeper here, Twitch?
I warn ya, it's, uh, pretty hot stuff.
You're a sick man, Clavin.
What are you?
Oh, nice shiner there, Twitch.
Yeah, they could never pass up a chance to sneak a peek at Natalie in her nightie.
Nightie?
!
Wasn't wearing anything I could see.
Huh?
Revenge is sweet.
Here's your mail.
Have a nice  Making your way in the world today Takes everything you've got Taking a break from all your worries Sure would help a lot Wouldn't you like to get away Sometimes you want to go Where everybody knows your name Ã¢â¢Âª And they're always glad you came Ã¢â¢Âª Ã¢â¢Âª You want to be where you can see Ã¢â¢Âª Our troubles are all the same You want to be where everybody knows your name You want to go where people know People are all the same You want to go where everybody knows your name.
Are you developing a slow leak, Diane?
No.
I have a problem.
I just don't know who to talk to.
Oh.
Well, how about me?
I don't think that would be appropriate in this case.
You see, it's a romantic problem.
Oh.
Considering our past, I don't think you could possibly maintain your objectivity.
Oh, come on.
Give it a shot.
Very well.
As you know, last week, I was substituting as a teaching assistant at the college and it seems that one of the students has fallen in love with me.
Marry him.
See!
Sam, in this case, the smitten youth is particularly good-looking.
Ah.
No, make that exceptionally good-looking.
All right.
No, make it Greek-god-like.
The problem is that he's very persistent and with his beauty and youthful ardor, I find myself inexplicably drawn to him.
He's asked me out several times.
Now, I don't want to encourage him, but on the other hand, I'm tempted.
What do you think I should do, Sam?
I'm sorry.
I got sidetracked there.
I was looking at my foot.
Sam, please.
As you know, I'm one who prides herself on her attraction to the inner man, but every once in awhile, someone comes along that makes you go, "zowie".
Oh, stop it, will ya?
You're just trying to make me jealous.
Your being jealous was the farthest thing from my mind although, now that you bring it up, any sane man would be jealous of Lance Apollonaire.
Oh, come on.
If you're gonna make a guy up, at least give him a name that doesn't sound like a bad aftershave.
I knew it was a mistake to talk to you.
I'll just have to deal with this on my own.
Rest assured, though, that the last thing I need is to become that young man's "Mrs. Robinson".
Wouldn't that be Mrs. Apollonaire?
No, Woody.
Mrs. Robinson was a Yes, it would.
Well, top of the day, everybody, and what a fine day it is, too, huh?
Why the good spirits, Mr. Clavin?
Well, uh, you guys ever hear of the Knights of the Scimitar?
Yeah, it's one of those lodges, right?
The lodge, Sammy.
You know, it's always, uh, been a dream of mine to become a member.
Well, yesterday, I made it.
You guys are looking at a Knight.
Hey, that's great, man.
Thanks Thank you.
Thank you very much.
You know, uh, Dad himself was a Knight.
When I was a kid, I used to sneak up into his room when he was out at work and, uh, try on his turban and sword.
And unless I miss my guess, you completed the outfit with your mother's bra and high heels.
Carla, this is serious.
It's no easy task getting into the Knights.
Oh, sure, as the son of an alumnus, I was, uh, guaranteed full membership, but, uh, well, hey, my oath does not permit me to say any more.
Thank God.
Yeah.
But the best part is Your oath, Clavin, your oath.
No, no, this stuff's permissible, Carla.
Oh, shut up, anyway.
Well, oh, well, so don't listen!
Hey, look, uh, listen, you guys.
The best part is that, uh, you know, now that I'm a member, I can get all you guys in.
Huh?
You know, of course it's gonna have to be one at a time.
Now, uh, I figured out a fair way to do the choosing, okay?
Now I'm thinking of a number between one and ten.
Whoever has the closest wins.
Uh, Norm, you first.
Two million and 12.
Two million 13.
Two million 14.
Well, the number was four.
Norm's closest with two million 12.
Darn!
I was gonna say four.
I shoulda stuck with my first instinct.
Cliffy, uh, thanks a lot, but I-I'm just not interested.
You know, I guess I'm an example of the old adage, "I'd never join a club that would have someone like you as a member," you know?
That's great.
Hey, Normie, Normie, you know, the Knights, they got a lot of, uh, you know, bankers, lawyers, and assorted captains of industry down there.
Yeah, so?
Well, so, they're gonna need accountants, and, uh, God knows you could use a few clients.
Yeah, I've heard those places are great for making contacts.
Yeah.
My business has been down just a bit this past year.
There you go.
Woody, give me the horn, will ya?
Oh, boy.
Hey, you're gonna love it down at the lodge, you know.
After a hard day's work, it's a great place to unwind.
Yeah, wearing those turbans, you probably need a place to unwind.
You know, unwind.
Turbans?
How they're all wound up around your head and you gotta unwind 'em?
Hey, uh good one, Woody.
I was voted class clown.
You should be proud.
Yeah, I was only running for class president.
Oh, Diane, will you do me a favor and run up and get some change from Melville's, please?
Oh.
What, what are you doing?
Lance is definitely taller than you are.
For a while there, I thought you were taller, but I see why I was mistaken.
Your shoulders are less broad, thus giving you the illusion of greater height.
I promised not to bring up this Adonis-like creature, didn't I?
Sorry.
No, no, hey, don't be sorry about a little fantasy.
I mean, I'm not sorry about the fantasy I had a couple of hours ago.
By the way, how many nurses do you think can fit in a standard-size hot tub?
Sam, I assure you, Lance is not a fantasy, and the feelings he inspires are very real, too.
Change.
Not for you or any man.
No, no, Diane.
Change: Nickels, dimes, quarters.
Can I ask you a question here, Carla?
Mm-hmm.
Who's the handsomest man you know?
Robert Redford.
No, no, he's a movie star.
I mean someone you really know.
Robert Redford.
You don't know Robert Redford.
Yes, I do.
How come you never mentioned it?
If you were the only woman in Boston he was messing around with, would you tell anybody?
Okay, all right, besides Robert Redford.
I mean, some somebody you see in the city here.
Who's the handsomest guy you see in the city?
Um, Dwight Evans.
No, not-not an athlete.
Somebody that you see every day.
My butcher.
In this bar, Carla.
Well, uh Standing next to you, getting very angry.
Well, that would be you, Sam.
Well, why do you put me through this stuff?
Put you through what?
Oh, hey, uh, Woody.
Come here for a second, will ya?
Uh, let me ask you a question.
Who, uh, who's the handsomest guy you know?
Oh, that's easy-- Carla's butcher.
Evening, everybody.
Norm!
What's the latest, Mr. Peterson?
Zsa Zsa marries a millionaire.
Peterson drinks a beer.
Film at 11:00.
Hey, uh, Normie, you're supposed to be at your interview down at the lodge.
Oh, yeah, I've already been, Cliff.
Already That took what, 15 minutes?
Yeah, something like that.
Oh, uh, so, did you get to meet the, uh, High Sultan?
Good guy he was.
Yeah.
Oh, well, so tell me, what'd you say to him?
Uh, something like, uh, "Hi, High".
That's great, Norm.
I told you to be friendly, not flippant.
You know, frankly, this just doesn't bode at all well for you.
Cheers.
It's for you.
Hmm.
It's probably those guys.
They said they were gonna call.
Yeah, like they called Joan of Arc before they turned her into French toast.
Now look, look.
Just treat this guy with respect, all right?
Hello.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Hi, High.
Yeah.
Great.
Oh, no, no, no.
No apology necessary.
That's okay.
Sure.
All right, bye.
Here.
You blew it.
You got nobody to blame but yourself, Norm.
No, Cliffie, he just, uh, apologized for making me wait so long.
I'm, uh, I'm a Knight.
Oh!
Great!
Congratulations.
How's that for the old Clavin clout, eh?
Evening, Sam.
Hey, Frasier.
What's with your voice?
Oh, I spent the afternoon screaming at a patient.
Oh.
What, what kind of therapy is that?
No, it's not therapy.
He burned a hole in my carpet.
Anyway how you doing, Sam, old man?
You know, Frasier, I, uh, I don't like that phrase "old man" anymore.
Uh, I-I prefer "buddy".
Oh, well, how you doing, Sam, old buddy?
Look, is, uh, something bothering you?
Well, yeah.
Diane's made up some guy who's supposed to be great-looking, just to get me riled.
Only I could care less about the whole thing.
Well, good for you, Sam.
You know, the old Sam would've rambled on and on about how jealous he isn't, proving only that he really is.
Right.
I mean, I could give a rat's rear what Diane does or who she does it with.
And I certainly am not jealous about some college punk kid.
And even if I were, which I'm not Call me at the office.
Hey, Sammy, you want to see a sap?
Sure, why not?
That's me, Carla.
Uh-huh.
But a great-looking sap, right?
Not bad.
Why?
Not bad?
He's a killer.
And I can't believe, with a mug like that, you're letting Diane do a number on you.
What are you talking about?
Oh, come on, she's just trying to make you jealous, and you're sucking it up like a Hoover deluxe.
No, I'm not.
I mean, first of all, I don't believe this Lance guy exists.
But if he does exist, I don't believe he's crazy about her.
And even if he exists and he's crazy about her, he's got to have a face like a fish.
Uh, excuse me.
Is Diane Chambers here?
Uh, she'll be right back, Mister?
Apollonaire.
Check out what Diane thinks is great-looking, will you?
Carla?
Is she gonna be all right?
Yeah, of course she's gonna be all right.
Are you all right?
You okay?
Yeah, yeah, I'm-I'm fine.
I just had this dream that I saw the handsomest man.
Would you stop that, please?
Oh, nice going, Sam.
I was hoping he'd give me mouth-to-mouth.
You still can, you know.
Diane's upstairs.
She'll be right down.
Can I get you something?
Yeah.
How about a beer?
Oh, dear, now, I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to ask you for an I.D.  Yeah, sure.
Is something funny?
Yeah, yeah, it says here you're six two and a half.
So?
Ha!
I'm six three.
Oh, Diane, your little friend's here to see you.
Lance, what are you doing here?
Well, I brought these for you.
Six two and a half.
Oh, thank you.
They're beautiful.
They must have cost you a fortune.
Oh, no, I I picked them all myself.
And arranged them, too.
I was hoping they might change your mind about going with me to Vermont.
Lance, I've already told you, I don't think it would be a good idea for you and me to go away together.
Will you at least think about it?
Okay I'll I'll think about it.
Fair enough.
Talk to you on Friday.
Uh-huh.
Oh, dear.
Things are beginning to get complicated.
Lance is becoming more insistent that I go away with him this weekend.
So, Sam, should I go or not with this figment of my imagination?
Well, if you do, just make sure he doesn't eat first.
Children tend to get car sick.
I know I shouldn't even be considering it, but when I look at him, I consider it.
Excuse me, but what happened to the woman who said it's the inner man who counts?
That woman just pictured Lance gathering flowers in his bikini briefs.
So did this one.
Thank you, Brother Tanner, for reading the minutes of last week's meeting.
Now, Brother Foley, what is the next order of business?
According to the agenda, High Sultan, we're to welcome our newest member into the Knights of the Scimitar.
Ah, yes.
Stand up, Norm Peterson, and be welcomed.
Norm, uh, Norm, why don't you tell us a little bit about yourself, huh?
Well, there's really nothing to say, guys.
Now don't be modest.
No, I mean it.
There's really nothing to say.
Uh Let's see, I was born in Chicago, uh I moved to Boston and became an accountant.
Are you married?
Yeah.
To?
Long.
By the way, uh, in case you guys need a good accountant, you know, I did happen to bring some of my business cards along, so, uh Oh, sorry, Norm, I-I guess you didn't get the word.
It-it's against the rules to do business with fellow lodge members.
You know, Cliff said My fault for listening.
HIGH  Well, Norm, the time has now arrived for you to undergo the initiation ritual.
Stand, please.
Approach me.
Are you prepared?
Yeah.
Congratulations.
Just, uh, just like that, huh?
Yeah, that's it.
Uh, grab a hat and sword out of the bin, hmm?
Great.
Yeah, my God, the pageantry, huh?
Okay, our, uh, next order of business is our third annual Hey, uh, Normie, look, I'm sorry about that business rule.
I, uh, I didn't know, I guess.
Great time to find out, Cliff.
Oh, hey, if it's any consolation, these guys give great parties.
Hoo-hoo-hoo, hey.
Oh, I'll tell you, I thought this was going to be really stupid, but these are a good bunch of guys, I tell you.
Yep.
Well, have I ever steered you wrong, Norm?
Oh, yeah; that's why I thought it was going to be stupid.
But, uh, you know, it's too bad about the business stuff, but I-I feel pretty comfortable with these guys.
Yeah.
Really, thank you for sponsoring me, buddy.
Mm-hmm.
I can't wait for some of these parties.
Bang, zoom, eh?
HIGH  Oh, uh, before I forget, the, uh, referendum that we ban beer at all lodge functions has been passed.
Good-bye!
So, what time's Peewee coming in?
If you're referring to Lance, I'm expecting him shortl soon.
And I don't appreciate these constant attempts to denigrate him.
Let me ask you a question.
What do you see in him?
You mean besides a young, brainy, stunningly gorgeous man with many interests similar to mine who's fawning over me and giving me all the attention I could ever ask for?
Yeah.
I see what I used to see in you before you decided to spend the last few months flogging me with your apathy.
Well, I'm sorry, Diane, but that's all I had handy.
Hi, Diane.
Have you made a decision?
Have I, Sam?
Send me a postcard.
I don't think I can go, because it would upset someone too much.
Diane, go with someone's blessings.
Excuse me.
May I speak with you for a moment?
Hop up on a stool there, Lance.
Carla, why don't you pour him a beer?
I know you're still smarting from my turning down your proposal of marriage, but how long can you drag this out?
You're hurting me, but you're also hurting yourself with this feigned indifference.
Well, while we're talking about hurting people, how do you think Lance is going to feel when he finds out that you're using him to get to me?
I am not using him.
I like him.
He treats me wonderfully.
And I don't, so go with him.
Mr. Malone, I'm about to call your bluff.
I'm going to go with him, and I'm going to have a great time, and it will leave you a hollow, broken man.
All right.
All right.
Just watch while I give you a little preview of our weekend together.
I'm going to kiss him in front of you and the whole bar, and it's going to kill you.
Lance this is for the flowers.
Now, Mr. Indifference, are you going to tell me that doesn't bother you?
Well, I have to admit for a while there, my life passed before my eyes but the funny thing is you weren't in it.
Right.
Lance, let's go.
Diane?
Yes, Sam?
It would've bothered me if he had done this.
Yes, I can see where that might have given you cause for concern.
Uh, so, Diane, are you about ready to go?
Uh Lance.
Thank you.
Um Lance, I-I-I just remembered I have to work this weekend.
That's okay.
I understand.
Bye.
Good-bye, Lance.
Well, kid, you blew it.
You know what would've really have bothered Sam would be if you had kissed her like this.
Carla, you're not involved in this.
I am now.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
Hey, Sam!
Hey, Woody.
Is it all right if I hang some Christmas decorations in here?
Sure.
Boy, is it that time again?
Wow, Christmas comes earlier every year, doesn't it?
I think if you check, Sam, it always comes on the 25th of December.
Of course, of course, of course.
Thank you, Woody, thank you.
Oh, look at that, will ya?
Nice Rudolph.
I made him myself.
No kidding?
You know, uh, Rudolph is my favorite guy in the Christmas songs.
Yeah.
You know, apparently then, Woody, you're unaware that the story of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer is one of the most unrealistic, and therefore potentially damaging in all of children's music.
It gives them a horribly distorted view of reality.
Yeah, but you gotta admit, it's easy to whistle.
Look, I'm serious.
You know, first the other reindeer tease and then ostracize him.
And then when his abnormality proves of service, they use him.
But then do they allow him to play in their stupid reindeer games?
Yes.
Oh, no, no, no, I know how the song goes.
In fact, not only do Donner, Blitzen, et al, not love him and laugh out with glee, but they doubly despise the bulbous-nosed little wimp.
Well, I gotta be off.
: Happy Holidays!
Making your way in the world today Ã¢â¢Âª Takes everything you've got Ã¢â¢Âª Ã¢â¢Âª Taking a break from all your worries Ã¢â¢Âª Sure would help a lot Wouldn't you like to get away Sometimes you want to go Where everybody knows your name And they're always glad you came You want to be where you can see Our troubles are all the same You want to be where everybody knows your name You want to go where people know People are all the same You want to go where everybody knows your name.
Prithee, friends, what thinkst thou?
You look ridiculous.
I beg your pardon.
This is an absolutely authentic example of feminine colonial headwear.
I'm sorry.
Thou lookest ridiculous.
Hey, Miss Chambers, what's the pilgrim get-up for?
Oh, I was hoping somebody might ask.
We're gonna have to talk later, Woody.
My graduate American Literature professor, Doctor Narsutis, annually recreates the first Thanksgiving dinner at his home.
He only invites two or three favored students to break bread with his family and other honored guests such as William Styron.
And guess who's going to be there?
William Styron?
Yes, Woody.
Ah, heck, anybody coulda got it if they'd really been listening.
What a wonderful opportunity for you, Diane.
You know, perhaps in the evening you can establish a rapport with Mr. Styron while passing the yams.
Who knows?
Come pie time, he may well have taken you under his wing and launched you into the literary galaxy.
Frasier, you and I are of like mind.
Except one of us is kidding.
Sam, I had thought we would spend the holidays together, but when you made no move in that direction, I made these alternate plans.
I hope it won't spoil your holiday.
Thank you.
No, I, I have, I have other plans.
Oh, good.
I'm glad to hear that.
And in all fairness, I will understand if you get an escort for the day.
It really wouldn't hurt my feelings in the slightest.
Good.
Good, good, 'cause I already have a date with Wendy.
How could you?
Now you just said that it was okay, didn't you?
Yes.
I'm sorry.
It's fine.
Enjoy.
Thank you.
Besides, I know that we'll have many holidays together when you and I are one.
You already are one, Diane.
So, what's everybody else doing?
Oh, the holidays just kind of snuck up  My mother-in-law Yeah, that sounds like fun, too.
Well, I'm on my own this year.
Kids aren't with ya?
Nah.
They're in Atlantic City with Nick.
Yeah, this is my first Thanksgiving away from home.
I mean, unless you count last year.
Wait a second.
Listen to you.
Carla, you have a new place.
You could have a little gathering.
Forget it.
Oh, come on.
What could be more enjoyable than opening your heart with holiday cheer?
Opening yours with a can opener?
That sounds great!
No, I meant the first part, Miss Chambers.
Well, why not?
But it's gonna have to be potluck.
Sammy, why don't you bring your date and join us?
All right.
Tell you what, Carla.
I'm good for dessert.
So I've been told.
You know, I'm glad to see that you're all fending off the holiday blues.
This time of year is filled with arguments, suicides, murders.
Yeah, I guess it's the seasonal happiness of others tends to throw a glaring light on the flaws in our own interpersonal relationships.
But see, of course, that's no problem for me.
I'm alone.
Wanna join us for some bird, Frasier?
Could I?
Sure.
The more the merrier.
Hey, so, uh, what time do you want us there, Carla?
What do you mean "us," Clavin?
Well, you know This party is for lonelies, not homelies.
Besides, you'll be with your mother.
No, no, not this year.
Uh, she's goin' down and ladle out some cream of something to the folks down at the Rescue Mission.
Yeah.
Oh, how sweet.
Why don't you join her?
Are you kiddin'?
I did my part this year.
I was in "Hands Across America," remember?
Oh.
Okay.
All right.
Norm, how about you and Vera?
Yeah?
No, I can't make it this year.
Why not?
I mean, we never even met Vera.
Yeah.
No, we gotta go to Vera's mother's.
Such a drag.
No beer, no TV, heat turned up to 80.
That's all right, Normie, you know.
You gotta do what your little wifey wants you to do.
You either got 'em or you don't.
All right.
You know somethin', Cliff, you're absolutely right.
Eight years I've been goin' to that old bat's house.
I think Vera owes me one, all right?
I'm gonna march into that house.
I'm just gonna say, "Vera, this year we're goin' to Carla's for Thanksgiving.
That's the last I wanna hear on the subject".
All right!
Good for you, Norm.
Okay, Norm's out.
Just count me in, all right?
You'll see.
Well, my house, noonish?
Oh, this is gonna be the greatest, huh?
All right.
Well, I'm so relieved.
Now I don't have to worry about my poor little Thanksgiving orphans whilst I sup with the literati.
Boy, you know, I don't know who's luckier.
You, 'cause you get to go to that great party, or us 'cause you get to go to that great party.
Taken down at the 40.
And there's the gun ending the first half.
Yeah, this is just like bein' back home.
Yeah, hey, uh, Carla, look, I, uh, I really wanna tell ya how much I appreciate you, uh, invitin' me over here.
Don't mention it.
I, uh, really appreciate it.
No, I mean, don't ever mention to anyone that I let you in this house.
May I change the channel or are you guys watching this halftime salute to our fabulous universe?
No, go ahead.
Oh, the parade.
And who's this flying our way?
None other than a 60-foot Mighty Mouse.
All right, Mighty Mouse!
I'll get it.
Afternoon, everybody.
Norm!
Where's Vera?
She's, uh, she's gonna put on a little more makeup.
That, uh, first coat didn't really take.
She is comin', isn't she?
Well, uh, maybe.
Well, what're you sayin' there, Normie?
We had the worst fight of our marriage.
Oh, it's tough.
She knew how much this meant to me and she still insisted on goin' to her mother's.
So I told her, "Look, I'm goin' to Carla's.
"You wanna meet me there, fine.
"If you want to go to your mother's, you can just stay there".
Brutal.
Well, you know, Norm, I don't think you should worry about it.
She'll probably come to her senses and show up.
The important thing is that you're here with us now.
This is gonna be the best Thanksgiving ever.
All right, Woody.
You know, I brought that turkey and, uh Mr. P., that turkey seems kinda big and raw.
You think it's gonna be ready in time for dinner?
Well, I had planned on just a bit more cookin' time, Woods, but, uh, traffic on I-93 was bumper-to-bumper.
I-93?
I took the side streets.
I got here in 35 minutes, buddy.
You didn't take Mass Avenue all the way?
I took Commonwealth.
I need the quickest way to get to the kitchen right now.
Oh, yeah, come on.
I'll show you where everything is.
Oh, hey, no waitin' around for my contribution.
Here ya go.
Popcorn balls!
Chow down, hear?
Hey, aren't these what you brought to the Halloween party?
Well, yeah, they're a perennial favorite, Woodman.
Yeah, but aren't these the ones you brought to the Halloween party?
Hi.
Oh, hi, Sammy.
I thought maybe you were Vera.
Boy, I can't wait to meet her.
Sammy, yo!
Hey, Sammy!
Hey, Sam.
So, uh, where's your date?
Oh.
Well, there's a change of plans.
Her sister showed up from out of town and they didn't like my idea, so what the hell, you know?
Hey, guys.
Hey, yeah, watch the parade.
You know, the important thing is that you're here now, huh?
We're all here.
This is gonna be the greatest.
Yeah.
Who needs family?
You know, Woody, you're right.
Family is not necessarily limited to blood relations.
That's right.
Uh, this is much better than, uh, hangin' around with a bunch of dingbat cousins all day long that you don't get to see but once a year, huh?
Yeah, or waiting for some duddy old aunt to show up  and spoil all your fun.
Gobble, gobble!
Come on, open the door.
No, no It's Thanksgiving, Carla.
Oh!
Okay maybe she'll choke on a drumstick.
Yeah.
Thank you, Carla.
Hello, everyone.
Hi, Miss Chambers.
Hey, uh, Diane.
Ooh, Carla, I like what you've done with the place.
What do you want?
Well, I decided that I'd rather be among friends than with my stuffy old professor.
Oh, dear, oh, dear.
What happened?
Oh Come on.
I'm afraid my golden afternoon turned to dross.
I thought it was clouding up.
The moment I arrived at the home of my professor, I was greeted by a man with a clipboard who handed me a tray and told me to serve a daiquiri to Ms. Radziwill.
Oh We students were invited as domestic help.
That might be all right when you're a wide-eyed 19-year-old, but it's certainly not all right when you're not.
We're all we're very sorry, Diane.
Thank you, Sam.
Yeah.
Well, at least you told that pinhead off, didn't ya?
Oh, I dropped the tray, burst into tears, took a moment to freshen up my mascara, and fled.
The important thing is you're here now, huh?
This is gonna be great.
Would somebody put a gag on Andy Hardy?
You know, Diane, if I were you, I'd call that guy up and nail his sheepskin to the wall.
You're absolutely right.
Hey, better yet.
Why don't you go on over there and tell him in person?
Yeah, good idea.
Yeah, that's right.
Hello, Dr. Narsutis?
This is Diane Chambers.
I yes, the one who fled.
Listen, I I beg your pardon?
Well, yes, of course I accept your apology.
He's invited me back.
Go, go.
Go.
Dr. Narsutis, I'm sorry, I can't.
I'm here with my friends, my support system, and there's really no place I'd rather be.
I trust this won't affect my grade?
Thank you.
Good day, sir.
Turned him down, huh?
Now that I find myself in the warmth of your company how could I possibly go?
Take Mass Ave.
I-93.
You holiday hooligans.
Give me a beer.
So, Sam-- Thanks.
Where's your date?
Oh, change of plans.
Her sister showed up.
Of course she did.
Chortle, chortle.
No, I'm serious.
I had a date and it fell through.
Oh, you don't have to convince me, Sam.
I believe you.
I'm telling you the truth.
And I love you for it.
How's the turkey doing there, Norm?
I'd say pretty good for about five minutes.
Oh.
Hey, half-time's over.
The game's back on.
Oh, great.
Oh, you're watching sports?
Hey, don't worry about it, Diane.
Game's almost over.
Oh, I hope so.
knocked away and it's incomplete at the 45.
Yeah, I deliver his mail.
Isn't this game over yet?
Not yet.
Well, their uniforms are different colors than before.
Uh, well, they gotta change them every time they score a touchdown, Diane.
Hey, Normie, where the hell is that bird?
Cliffy, it's a big turkey.
So are you.
with a tremendous body slam!
Now wait a minute!
Diane, Diane, you're absolutely right.
You know, let's turn it back on the football, guys.
There you go.
No, no, no!
Enough is enough!
I don't think watching television was the pilgrims' original intent when they created the holiday.
Well, uh No, hey, hey, hey Hey, come on!
All right, all right, look, look, look, look, the turkey's probably almost done.
Let's just adjourn to the dining room, huh?
All right!
I second that emotion.
Okay, we'll be sitting boy-girl, boy-girl.
Clavin, you can sit anywhere.
Somebody save me a seat.
I got to see a man about a horse.
He doesn't really have to see a man about a horse.
All right.
Well, what do you say we, uh, dig into this, uh, Jell-O surprise here?
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh we're not eating until the turkey is on the table.
Everybody went to a lot of bother to make this fine meal.
We're not going to eat it in pieces.
Keep your hands off the food.
Listen, guys, the, uh, turkey's not exactly brown just yet.
What color is it, then?
Off-white.
But I've reset the timer and I turned up the gas.
I expect the little pop thing will be popping out any time now.
Great.
Well, I hope it hurries 'cause I'm starved.
Well, I suggest we take advantage of the delay and engage in one of my family's favorite little Thanksgiving traditions.
Sam, I know you're standing in the hallway.
Get in here.
Rats.
In lieu of grace, we stand up and take turns toasting that for which we are thankful.
Since you're already standing, Sam, why don't you begin?
All right, I'm, uh I'm thankful that I have a super car and a cool stereo and that I'm not dressed in a pilgrim's outfit.
I'll drink to that.
You make a mockery of everything.
Oh, well Hey, can I go next?
I don't see a line.
: Woody.
Woody.
Woody.
Uh I'm thankful that I'm an American.
Hey, all right.
I'm thankful for the upbringing my parents gave me.
Uh, I'm thankful for all the friends I've made in Boston.
And, uh I'm thankful that I can do this.
Yo!
Put it away.
Hey, can you guys do this?
Oh!
That makes my thing look kinda stupid.
I can wiggle my ears, watch this.
You guys ever see tongue push-ups?
Look at these ears flapping.
Watch this.
Please, please!
We are not here to be thankful for strange things we can do with our bodies.
Norman, you're next.
Well, I'm thankful that there's a turkey in the kitchen that needs to be checked.
Yeah.
Yeah, get the damn thing out here.
All right, I guess I need to give you an indication of what I had in mind.
Now I, too, am very thankful for my health and for my dear friends.
But on this very special occasion, my mind goes back over the years to the people who have influenced me.
And I would like to name some of them for you.
Teilhard Chardin George Sand Caravaggio Oh, Emily Dickenson the Buddha Frank Lloyd Wright Jean d'Arc Shari Lewis and Lamb Chop.
Uh, guys, uh, listen, I'm having a slight, uh, problem with the damn bird, all right?
What color is it now, Norman?
Well, I think we're moving into the earth tones.
This better be good news, Norm.
Look, uh, I'm sorry, guys.
The little pop thing won't pop out.
There's something wrong with it.
There's something wrong with you.
No, no, it's the little pop thing.
Hey, could somebody please explain to me where the little pop thing is on the turkey?
I mean, 'cause maybe it's different in the city, but in the country where I come from, turkeys aren't born with little pop things.
The little pop thing has a name!
It's called a thermometer!
Now can we all please say "thermometer".
: Thermometer!
Thermometer, yeah!
We can say it till we're blue in the face.
It's not gonna make it pop out any faster.
I think something's wrong with your oven, Carla.
Hey, my oven was just fine until you stuffed Birdzilla in it.
Come on, you guys, come on.
We don't have to bite each other's heads off here.
It may be the only thing we get to eat this day, Sammy.
Hey, you guys, this is Thanksgiving.
And I still say this is going to be the greatest.
Oh, who the hell do we think we're kidding?
We're all a bunch of pathetic dropouts.
Scorned by our loved ones, as if anybody ever loved us at all.
Hey, will you lighten up, man?
The only thing wrong here is we're hungry.
Now who else wants to join me in these ice-cold potatoes?
Hey, they'll go great here with the, uh, Jell-O soup.
I'm dying to try some of the hair growing on the cruditÃ©s.
Well, pass me my peas.
I made them so I know they're okay.
Was that remark, uh, directed at me, Carla, by any chance?
No, it was directed at your stupid turkey and your stupid stuffing and your stupid gravy.
What's wrong with my gravy?
Oh, nothing, except you could walk across the skin on top of it.
Oh, well, I'm sorry, Julia Child.
Here's your perfect peas.
Oh, look, I spilled one.
Sorry.
Thank you.
Norm, I'm sorry about what I said about your gravy.
All right.
It's okay.
Fine.
And so are the carrots.
Uh, anybody want some of these, uh, lovely yams?
Woody, would you care to test the gravy skin?
People!
People!
People!
Stop this immediately!
I have never been witness to such a silly, soph Sam Malone kiss your butt good-bye!
Food fight!
I knew this was gonna be the greatest.
Huh?
Good bird.
Hey, Diane, may I say you look saucy in cranberry.
Laugh while you can, Sam.
Just remember that revenge is a dish best served cold.
You won't know when and you won't know where, but I'm going to get you.
Now that we're done with dinner, I'd like to make a toast to our loved ones who weren't fortunate enough to be here with us.
Nice thought.
Uh, Mom, Dad Uncle Fergie My kids.
All right, Vera.
Yeah.
Ma.
Coach.
Yeah.
Oh God bless you all.
Very nice.
Well, I think we're about ready for dessert.
Yeah.
Everybody get enough to eat?
You know, I never had a chance to try the potatoes.
I'll get it.
Oh, well, here, let me, uh Oh, thank you.
There you go, man.
Sure.
Vera.
You came.
Honey, I'm so happy.
Hey, you guys, uh Come on, Vera, come on in, meet all the guys.
This is great.
We finally get to meet Vera.
Sam think fast!
Everybody, this is, uh, Vera  Charming friends, Norm.
Get your coat.
Yes, dear.

Of all the stinkin', dirty, rotten, maggot-sucking, vermin-infested stinkweeds!
Practicing for that Mother of the Year speech again, Carla?
Shut up!
What seems to be the problem?
I've been planning my Elvis pilgrimage to Memphis for weeks, and now Nick is backing out of taking care of the kids.
He says his appendix burst.
Well, that seems serious to me.
His appendix bursts every time I need a favor.
Boy, if he was smart, he'd have that removed.
Hello, one and all.
Hello.
How are you, love of my life?
Just fine, pain in my neck.
The most exciting thing has happened.
You'll never guess.
I got a letter from Syzygy.
Stop it!
Yeah!
All right, all right, who's Syzygy?
It's not a who-- it's a new literary review, dedicated to publishing the prose and poetry that's right on the cutting edge.
Well, I, for one, am excited for you, Diane.
Ah, there, it passed.
Oh let-let me have a look at it.
What does the letter say?
Well, I submitted one of my poems for publication, and quite honestly, I was overwhelmed by the response.
It was more than I could ever have hoped for.
But I blush.
Read it.
It speaks for itself.
Oh, uh this is a rejection letter.
It's not a rejection letter per se.
It's a "soon and inevitably to be accepted" letter.
Listen to this.
"Your work is not entirely without promise".
They're almost begging for another submission.
Boy, you know, I I hope you don't get your hopes up there too high, because that looks like a form letter to me.
Poor Sam.
This really threatens you, doesn't it?
Let me assure you that I can heed my man as well as my muse.
Syzygy would not even have bothered to respond to my letter if they hadn't perceived me as an up-and-coming literary talent.
You know, this is just like you.
You-you turn every defeat into a victory.
It's like the time when I said that I didn't want to see you anymore, and you all of a sudden start making wedding plans.
Sam, we can talk about the wedding later-- I have work to do.
You know, I bet I could, uh, send a poem to that magazine and get the same letter back that you did.
Oh, Sam, you don't want to write a poem.
Poetry is very, very difficult.
What's the big deal?
All you got to do is rhyme.
Most great modern poetry doesn't necessarily have to rhyme.
Well, that's even easier, isn't it?
Fine.
Fine, fine, fine.
Go ahead, write your little poem.
You don't think I can even write a stupid poem.
Of course you can.
Don't forget to capitalize the first letter.
I'm gonna do this.
I'm gonna show you that I can be as much of a reject as you.
I told you, I was not rejected.
Whatever.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a little creating to do.
Coffee : Any of you guys know how to write poetry?
Uh, I know how to make fun of 'em.
No.
Great, Nick.
That's wonderful.
You're not as much of a scum bucket as I thought you were.
No, that's not an attempt at reconciliation.
Hey, Nick's gonna take care of the kids.
Graceland, here I come.
Hey, all right.
Hey, all right.
Didn't you go to Graceland last year?
Yeah, but this is special-- I mean, how many times does the tenth anniversary of Elvis's death roll around?
Don't ask me.
I wasn't a fan.
Hi, Sam.
Hello.
Sam, have you received that rejection letter for your poem yet?
No, I haven't.
Hmm.
The letter I received arrived within two weeks of my submission, and here it is, three weeks, and nothing for you.
Isn't that odd?
Odd.
What's this?
It's that magazine you couldn't get your poetry into.
Thank you, Woody.
I mean, what is it doing here?
Well, I decided if I'm gonna try to write, I might as well read some of that poetry stuff.
Sam, that's very commendable.
I didn't realize the new issue was out.
Yeah, it's not bad, either.
They got one I really like.
Page 37, I believe.
Yeah, read it out loud.
It'd be good for me to hear.
All right.
"Nocturne" by Sam Mal oh!
Now ooh, Diane, come on, please, books are our friends.
The page is 37 there.
Yes, thank you.
Yeah.
Well  Diane Chambers is nothing if not open-minded.
Perhaps you you do have some spark of talent.
They published your poem, huh?
All right!
Hey, don't let it get out, though, that I'm a sensitive guy.
Oh, yeah, yeah!
Hey, Sammy!
Very well, I've arrived at my objective opinion.
All right.
This is one of the most amateurish, hackneyed, odious pieces of effluvium ever to wash down the pike.
Listen to this drivel.
"I fly through a puckish arena, "where echoes dance, where echoes dance, where echoes dance" This sounds familiar.
Well, you said it three times.
This poem is plagiarized.
Oh, now I stole it?
And a minute ago, you said it stunk.
It does stink.
Leave it to you to not have the sense to steal something worthwhile.
Aw, you know, I realize that it's tough to have somebody come along and swipe your dreams of glory, so I will not take offense at that remark.
That poem is fraudulent, and I intend to find its true source, even if I have to search through every greeting card to do so.
Believe me, Sam Malone, I will not rest until today, the blackest day in the history of literature, is blotted out for all eternity.
Diane, I think you're getting overexcited.
Uh, why don't you just calm down?
I tell you, I've just come from my Coping With Anxiety Group, and I have just the trick.
Now, here.
Put this over your head and breathe.
I assure you, I am in complete control.
I think the bag's a good idea anyhow.
It's been proven time and time again that reincarnation breaks no physical laws as we know 'em.
You know, I was thinking about this the other day, and, uh, I think in my next life I'd like to come back as the president of France.
Why is that, Wood?
Well, I think it'd attract a lot of business to the bar.
Coffee, Woody.
Oh, sure thing, Miss Chambers.
I'll take the pot.
Say, what's with Diane there?
She's still searching for Sam's poem.
Dr. Crane, I think you ought to talk to her.
I mean, all she does is read, read, read.
I bet she goes through a book a week.
Uh Diane, uh, Diane, you don't smoke.
What's your point?
Hey, there!
Still looking for that poem, huh?
I'm sure it's a post-war piece.
It's not British.
The syntax is wrong.
I have a hunch it might be regional.
You may not believe this, but, uh, I do sympathize with you.
It's not easy to watch those people you scoffed at run past you while you remain stuck in the mud like a weighted-down elephant.
Made that up.
Does this mean that you've stopped trying to get your poetry published?
Not at all.
Oh I'm diligently producing new work.
Well, that-that's good.
Uh, I'd love to talk to you about it.
Uh, how's it goin', Diane?
Would you like to know how it's going?
Yeah.
This is how it's going.
I'm totally blocked.
I can't write another word.
Hmm.
"Hurricane of Wills," unfinished.
"The Death of a Shallow Man," unfinished.
"A Bartender Dismembered," unfinished.
I suffer failure after failure while you, a despoiler of the English language are lionized in front of the world.
That's how it's going.
Well, maybe this little literary chat wasn't such a good idea.
Wanna make out?
Well Make out?
Diane, now listen, uh, listen, I think the joke's gone far enough, don't you?
You haven't eaten a decent meal in a week.
You're living off of cigarettes and coffee.
I mean, for God's sake, this little literary magazine's circulation must be what, 600.
That's just the beginning.
You see, the original 600 readers drop their copies on buses, in taxicabs and doctors' offices.
And another 600 people pick them up and take them to the airport, where they go all over the country.
And then they get taken on international flights.
Tierra del Fuego, Sierra Leone; all the remotest parts of the world.
And soon, I defy you to find me a house, a hut, an igloo or a wickiup that doesn't have a copy on the coffee table.
Diane And then, then, then : everyone in the world, every living thing will be laughing at me!
Because he got published, and I did not!
Hi, everybody, I'm back!
Hey, Carla!
How was the trip?
Greatest vacation I have ever taken in my life.
Graceland does not disappoint.
And to commemorate the special anniversary, I had this picture taken of me and Elvis.
Oh, look at that.
How do they do that?
They use cardboard cutouts.
Wow, you know, you look almost lifelike here.
So do you, Woody.
Woody, more coffee.
Okay, Miss Chambers.
I've got something to cheer ya up.
I sent in a poem to that magazine of yours.
Oh, my God, don't tell me that they published yours, too?
No, I got one of your "soon and inevitably to be accepted" letters.
Huh?
That's pretty exciting.
Oh, my God.
Sam was right.
Sam the Bard.
It was a form letter all along.
We two were sent a condescending form letter.
I'm framing mine.
Hi.
You okay?
You win, Sam.
I've struggled so hard for so long to keep my dreams alive, and I haven't fooled anyone but myself.
I know all along you all considered me a pretentious, self-deluded windbag and apparently, you've all been right.
I'm never going to be Diane Chambers, the great poet, the world-famous novelist, the revered artist.
I've gone as high as I'm going to go.
I'm a waitress in a beer hall and not a very good one.
A waitress.
A waitress.
A waitress.
Miss, could you take our order?
Come on.
Let's go have a talk in my office.
Come on.
Sweetheart?
Okay, come on, sweetheart.
Come on.
Sit in the big chair there.
Okay, I have something, uh, I have to say here.
And, uh, I just want you to promise before I say it that you, uh, won't go crazy.
Don't worry.
I've hit rock bottom.
I have no emotions left.
Oh, all right.
Um I, uh, I did copy that poem.
You are scum.
I tried to make one up myself, but I-I just couldn't, and so I-I copied one.
I never thought it would be published, I promise.
What could you possibly have been thinking of, Sam?
It obviously had been published to begin with.
No, no, no, it hadn't.
Well, then please tell me.
I think you owe me that much.
Where did it come from?
Well, actually, it, uh, came from a letter that you wrote to me.
One of my letters?
Mm-hmm.
And when you didn't recognize it out there, I decided to play it out, and rub your smug little nose in it.
I'm sorry.
I probably went too far.
Oh, my God, it's one of mine.
How could I not recognize this exquisite fluidity?
The characteristic Chambers' grace in the face of hard imagery?
Come on.
You told me that it stunk.
Sam, I'm a poet, not a critic.
Oh I'm published!
Yeah!
I'm published!
Oh, this is so exciting!
This is like like the first time I ever rode a bicycle.
Oh, this is great.
You're-you're not mad.
Mad?
I'm elated.
Hey, all I'm elated, too.
Oh, what a glorious day.
I'm going to go do what poets do drink myself stinky.
Wait a minute.
This always happens.
You always squirm out of these things unscathed.
You did a terrible thing!
I know it.
No, you don't.
You put me through hell.
This time it's going to be different.
I'm going to make you suffer.
What-what're you going to do?
I don't know.
Yes, I do.
You're going out there and admit to everyone that you stole this poem from me.
Oh, come on, you mean I have to go out and tell the whole bar that I'm not a poet?
You sure do, mister.
Let's go.
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?
Mm What are you doin'?
Oh, yeah, I've heard about this.
Mm-mm.
You wanna go back to my place and ride a bike?
Don't you ever, ever again try to tell me that you don't love me.
Oh, God, every time I think I'm about to get my hedge clipped, you start talkin' about love, and it's just not fair.
You saved my love letters.
I was so excited about being a published poet, it didn't sink in at first.
This proves it.
You love me now as you always did, madly and completely.
Hey, wait, listen to me.
I did not save your letters.
Where did this come from?
I found it in my apartment.
I got pizza boxes that old that have more meaning.
Come on.
Sam Malone, look me in the eyes and tell me you don't love me.
If you can do that, then I have no choice but to believe you.
Oh, boy, I'm sorry, but I don't love you, Diane.
Uh, I thought I did once, but I was wrong.
There's nothin' goin' on between us here.
I mean, it's all over.
Very well.
That was in the eyes, wasn't it?
I guess I'll go before I make a bigger fool of myself.
Aha!
What the hell are you doing?
I came to catch you in a lie, and I did.
Don't I know my darling better than anyone else?
Okay, so I kept some of your letters.
Big deal.
I mean, that doesn't prove anything.
I mean, I got lots of junk in here.
Look at this.
I save all sorts of things.
Look-look at that.
Where is it?
A warranty for my toaster.
Look at that, huh?
My letters.
A ticket-- here-here it is-- a ticket to, uh, 1980 boat show.
Your protests only prove my point.
There, poker chips.
Three poker chips.
You know, Sam, Each one of these poker chips I was thinking.
means more to me than your letters.
You know when we finally do get married, A key.
we could move to the country.
A whistle.
Not too far away Look at that-- a whistle.
because I couldn't be far from the theater.
A double-C battery.
And I know how much you love the ocean.
Sam Four paper clips.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
I'll tell you, Woody, the psychiatric profession can really get rough sometimes.
I think if I hear one more person telling me about one more problem, I'll explode.
I know just how you feel, Dr. Crane.
Actually, I suppose you do.
Our professions are really very much alike.
We both have to listen patiently while people unload their grief and suffering.
Sometimes it's just more than I can bear.
I know just how you feel, Dr. Crane.
You know, if only I had your ability to listen to a person's problem, sympathize with them, and yet still go on about my business calmly and happily.
How do you do it, Wood?
I know just how you feel, Dr. Crane.
You're not listening to me, are you?
I know just how you feel, Dr. Crane.
How about a double scotch rocks?
Coming right up.
Making your way in the world today Takes everything you've got Taking a break from all your worries Sure would help a lot Wouldn't you like to get away Sometimes you want to go Where everybody knows your name And they're always glad you came You want to be where you can see Our troubles are all the same You want to be where everybody knows your name You want to go where people know People are all the same You want to go where everybody knows your name.
All right, here, here it is, troops.
The reason I called you in was to tell you I just got a chance to go up to Moose River to do some fishing with some old baseball buddies.
Ah, a fishing trip.
Another desperate yet futile attempt to forget me.
No, no, just another desperate yet futile attempt to catch some fish.
The problem is I want to leave right now.
So, who wants to be saddled with taking charge of the place while I'm gone?
Oh, me, me!
I do!
I want to!
Uh, wait a minute here.
Uh, all right, sit down, sit down.
I guess I'm gonna have to make an executive decision here.
All right, hold out your fists.
There you go.
One potato, two potato, three potato, four Oh, Sam, Sam, Sam.
This isn't fair.
It isn't?
No-- everybody knows that when you do "one potato, two potato" with three people, you end up with the same person with whom you started.
Oh, yeah, all right.
Uh Oh, I got something else here.
All right, all right.
My dog died last night.
What color is his blood?
What kind of disgusting game is that?
It's something I played when I was a kid.
Now pick a color.
What for?
Your dog's blood.
Oh, this is horrible.
You played this as a child?
Well, no wonder you're so disturbed.
Would you please pick a color so I can spell it and knock somebody out?
All right, mauve.
All right, all right, um Here we go, yeah.
We'll use a bat here.
Good idea.
Okay, I'm in charge!
Sam.
Actually, I, uh, had this is mind.
Woody, you know how to do this.
Here you go.
All right, here.
Oh, oh  Oh!
He grabbed the little knobby thing at the top.
You can't do that.
That's not part of the bat.
The little knobby thing is so a part of the bat.
Well, can he grab it?
Sure he can grab it.
!
Yeah.
And then you and I get three turns trying to kick it out of his fingers and the one who kicks it out wins.
Well, how do we decide who kicks first?
One potato, two potato Oh!
You're going to have to make a decision like a rational adult human being.
All right, all right.
Okay, Woody's my man.
Oh!
Oh, no!
Come on!
Why Woody?
Well, because he's the only person who hasn't irritated the hell out of me in the last five minutes.
Come on.
Get out of here.
Let me, uh, go over some of the management rules with him.
Go on, go on.
I think you're really gonna enjoy this weekend, boss.
Okay, first rule-- keep this with you at all times.
Oh, Woody, here's a letter from Indiana.
Oh, boy!
It's from my girlfriend, Beth.
So how are things in the great Midwest, huh, Woods?
Well, let's everybody gather 'round and we'll find out, huh?
Oh, great, let's pull up the stove, whittle a tetch and chaw some tabacky.
Boy, Beth writes the greatest letters in the world.
I can't wait for you guys to hear this.
"Dear Woody, "this is the hardest letter I've ever had to write.
"What I have to say is that I care about you very much, "but I'm afraid we can't stay together anymore.
"You see, I've fallen in love with Leonard Twilley "and we're flying up to Niagara Falls "on the 20th to be married.
"We're gonna drop by and see you on our way.
"I feel I have to explain in person.
"I hope you understand "and find it in your heart to forgive me.
See you Saturday.
Love, Beth".
Well, this isn't quite as good as her usual letters.
I'm so sorry, Woody.
I can't believe it.
Beth and Leonard Twilley.
Woody, today's Saturday, you know.
Uh, she could be here any minute.
Gosh, I'm feeling kind of bad.
Listen, if you'll excuse me, I think I'd like to be alone now.
Oh, I guess it'd be easier if I left.
Uh, wait a sec, Wood.
You know, maybe this is really a blessing in disguise.
You see, sometimes in order to achieve maturity, it's necessary to disengage oneself from relationships that keep one's growth rooted in an artificially prolonged period of stasis.
I know just how you feel, Dr. Crane.
Woody, come on.
Sometimes things work out for the best, you know?
Look at it this way.
Boston's crawling with beautiful, single women.
Just get on out there.
Yeah, he's right, you know.
Take it from one who knows.
Yeah, but since Sammy's not here, just take it from us.
Yeah, you know, he is, uh, right there, Woody.
You know, the best way to forget about Beth is go out there, find some skirt, have her, use her and throw her away.
Maybe you guys are right.
Maybe the best way to get over this is to make wild, crazy, passionate love to the first available woman who comes along.
Woody, don't listen to them.
It's not necessary for you to suppress your grief in debauchery.
It's important for you to experience it.
People grow from intense suffering.
Yeah?
Then how come I haven't grown an inch since I've known you?
Oh, boy, Normie, look at this.
Another psychic's head exploded.
Kind of makes you wonder why anyone goes into that line of work, doesn't it?
Excuse me.
I've been experiencing grief all afternoon and instead of killing myself, I'd like to take you out to dinner.
Sounds great, but no thank you.
Did I say it was my treat?
Woody, you've hit on nearly every woman in the bar.
Why are you so persistent?
Well, when Beth gets here, you know, I want to show her that I got someone else, too.
If there's one thing I can't stand, it's that look of pity in her eyes.
I'm sure she's far too wrapped up in her own happiness to have time to pity you.
Well, that is a comfort.
Hi, Woody.
Oh, hi, Beth.
Hi, Leonard.
Did you get my letter?
Yeah, I got it.
Are you mad?
Oh, no, I'm not mad at all.
You know, you're the last person in the world I ever wanted to hurt.
Hey, I'm fine, really.
Can I get you guys something to drink?
Wine.
How 'bout a brewski?
Brewski Woody, we didn't mean for this to happen.
It was fate.
I was in Fryer's Hardware Store looking at some copper tubing.
Beth was buying a lawn sprinkler and, well I never stood a chance.
Oh, Leonard, I can't stand it.
Look what we've done to him.
I know, it's worse than I thought it would be.
Oh, please, guys, don't do that.
How can we happily walk down the aisle knowing we're leaving him here like this?
I won't be in the mood for any cake.
Beth Leonard I keep getting this picture of you sitting alone in your room, night after night, and it makes me want to cry.
Hi, Beth.
Nice to meet you, Leonard.
Woody, uh, don't you think it's time to tell Beth about you-know-who?
Who?
Well, that lovely young lady you've been seeing so much of.
Is this true?
Yes.
Well, I'm glad you found someone, Woody.
What's she like?
Well, uh, uh, she's about four, five, five, five feet four or five.
She's kind of hard to describe.
Cornflower blue eyes, titian hair, Raphaelesque figure.
And she smells good.
I feel so much better knowing you won't be alone.
Well Come on, Leonard.
We'd better be going.
It was nice seeing you, Woody.
Bye, Beth.
Good luck.
Yeah, good luck, Beth.
Well, it's too bad you two had to leave.
I know you would have enjoyed meeting Woody's girlfriend.
She's extraordinary.
Yeah, we could have had dinner tonight.
Actually our plane doesn't leave till midnight.
Oh, that's right.
Well, we can all have dinner together.
Oh, great.
Yeah, fine.
Way to go, Miss Chambers.
What am I gonna do now?
I'm sorry, Woody.
I have a strict rule about meddling in other people's affairs.
Why did Miss Chambers have to shoot my big mouth off for me?
Boy, this is the worst thing that's ever happened to anybody.
Oh, I don't know about that, Woody.
Uh, did you ever have your head explode?
Woody, as a way of apologizing, let me try to think of another way out of this.
Now, let's see.
I'm sure we can think of something.
Well, it better be good, 'cause I need a date quick.
Oh, boy, it's too bad Sammy's not here to help ya.
Hey, Sammy may not be here, but his inventory is.
Yeah, Woody.
Oh, hey, hey, hey Woody, put that down on the bar very carefully and walk away.
Yeah, it's a little bit too hot for you to handle there, Woodman.
I'll tell ya what I'll do.
I'll give you the number of one of my tootsies.
I think he'd prefer something that lives above ground.
Wait a minute.
Do you really think it's proper to be rifling through a man's personal papers?
No matter how close a friend, no matter how Miss Chambers, you're in here.
Give me that.
"Diane Chambers.
"Probably the most incredible woman I ever met.
Don't you agree, Diane"?
Well Hey, here's one.
Three stars.
"Tina Wilson.
Fun, sexy, easy".
Well, she sounds interesting.
And you know just what to do with sweet Tina Wilson.
Have her, use her, and I'll throw her away.
I don't think you're going to get an answer.
Why not?
I'm sweet Tina Wilson.
Well, what would be a good time to call you?
Ah, it's not workin'.
I'm no good at this.
No, no, no, Woody.
Don't give up so easily.
Oh, here's one.
Oh, oh, look at this here, the ultimate one, too, huh?
She's got a whole page to herself.
Yeah!
"Desiree Harrison".
Oh, look at all those stars.
Yeah, any more stars you'd have to pledge allegiance to her.
Yeah, hey.
"The best, the best, the best".
Hey, get on the horn there, Woods.
Woody, something tells me you shouldn't do this.
Please reconsider.
Oh, that's easy for you to say.
You got him into this.
Why don't you do something extraordinary for once and butt out?
What do I say to her?
Uh, tell her you're a friend of Sam Malone.
Good.
Hi, uh, De, Desiree?
Yeah, I'm a friend of Sam Malone.
Hold on.
She wants to know why I called.
Tell her that, uh, Sammy said she was the best.
And you want to find out for yourself.
Oh, good.
Uh, yeah, Sam says you're the best and I wanna find out for myself.
Hold on.
She wants to know my name.
Wing it.
Yeah, it's Woody Boyd.
Yeah, how about 7:00 tonight?
Yeah?
Okay, uh, well, I'll see ya here in the bar.
Great.
Ha-ha!
All right, Woody!
Well, seein' as how it's Gomer's night out that leaves me in charge of the bar.
Oh, not necessarily.
Woody, who do you assign to take command of the bar?
Well, I don't know how to choose between the two of you.
Oh, I know, I know.
We're both your friends.
No, it's not that.
You ruined "one potato, two potato".
Okay, why don't we let the bar decide?
Well, that seems the fair and democratic thing to do.
We should each make a speech presenting our best arguments as to why we should be in charge of the bar and we'll leave it up to you.
Carla, the floor is yours, and not for the first time, I might add.
If I'm elected, no way will Diane make a speech.
Whoo!
Whoo!
Hey, hubba-hubba!
How do I look?
Is my tie crooked?
Uh, no, but your pants are on backwards.
Made ya look.
Made ya look.
That's very funny, Mr. Clavin, but I guess I'm not in the mood for that clever humor.
Yeah, you and the rest of creation.
Yeah, I'm worried about my date with, uh, Desiree.
She's one of Sam's women.
She may be too much for one man.
Is there somebody here named Woody?
Yeah.
I'm Desiree.
Uh, just a minute, please.
Is it me or does she look different than she did on the phone?
She comes highly recommended by the master.
All right, here goes nothin'.
So you're Desiree?
Yeah.
Hi, I'm Woody.
Can I get your coat?
What's she doin' here?
That's Woody's date.
Woody's goin' out with Sam's cleaning lady?
Cleaning lady?
That's right.
Sam says she's the best.
So how are you?
Fine.
Shall we get started?
What?
Right, right here?
Here or in the back if you prefer.
Well, don't you want any dinner first?
No, I'd like to get right to it.
I'll stop to eat when I get a little tired.
Wow.
I figure you probably have your own equipment.
If not, I have mine out in the car.
What sort of equipment?
Well, the first thing we'll need is a bucket.
Really?
Yeah, and some rubber gloves and one of those really hard brushes with a long handle.
You've gotta be kiddin' me.
Well, I need something to get to those hard-to-reach places.
Would you excuse me for a moment, please?
Guys, I think there's things about Sam that we don't know.
No, no, Woody, she's not Sam's date.
She's his maid.
Yeah, Carla told us.
Those stars mean she's the best housekeeper around.
Oh, boy, do I feel stupid!
What am I gonna do now?
Maybe you should, uh, tell her the truth.
Yeah, yeah, okay.
Uh, listen, ma'am, I think there's been a terrible mistake.
I don't think I'm gonna be Hi, Woody.
So that's what you call titian hair.
Hi, I'm Beth.
I'm Desiree.
This is my fiancÃ©, Leonard.
Good.
Yeah, they're gonna be joining us for dinner tonight.
Dinner?
You wanna take me out to dinner?
Yeah.
So what do you say?
Well, it beats scrubbin' grout with a toothbrush.
You folks and your big-city expressions.
Yes, I thought we'd eat at Melville's, if that's okay with you, ma'am.
Okay.
I was expecting someone a little younger, Woody.
Me, too.
That was fun.
Nice seein' ya.
Listen, have a nice marriage.
Well, didn't somebody mention dancing?
We still have time before our plane leaves.
Now you want to take me dancing?
It sure beats scrubbin' grout with a toothbrush.
Hey, I could live here.
Let me go freshen up.
Oh, dancing.
I hope my knees hold out.
Is it any wonder I love her?
I like her, Woody.
Yeah, listen, why don't you two have a seat?
I'll get you somethin' to drink.
Woody I know I got you into this, but it's time to stop.
I know Beth hurt you, but she doesn't deserve to be lied to.
Besides, would your mother be proud of you if she knew what you were doing?
Let Beth know how you feel.
I think it would do you both good.
You're right, Miss Chambers.
I guess I owe Beth that much.
Oh, you won't tell my mother, will you?
Mum's the word.
You won't tell my mum, will you?
Excuse me, uh, Beth, can I talk to you for a moment?
Sure, Woody.
Excuse us, Leonard.
Sure.
You're not gonna steal her back from me, are you, Woody?
Go drink your beer, Leonard.
Yes, dear.
Uh, listen, Beth.
Desiree's not my girlfriend.
Well, I had a feeling.
What gave it away?
When she forgot your name during dinner.
See, I was so hurt, I, I didn't want you to think that I was on my own.
I'm sorry.
But you know we couldn't have lasted.
We've grown apart.
We're just too different now.
You're the adventurous type.
I just want to settle down.
I love you, Beth.
I love you, too, Woody.
Leonard's more a part of my world.
Well, maybe I could move back to Indiana.
Do you want to do that?
No.
And I could never live in Boston, so how does that leave us?
Real sad.
Yeah.
Well, I hope you get happy.
There's, uh, something I want to give you.
Oh, no, it's okay.
The drinks are on me.
No.
I meant this.
Good-bye, Woody.
That, Leonard, is, uh, how the tractor was born.
Come on, Leonard.
We have a plane to catch.
Okay.
Well, good-bye.
You guys ever find yourselves in Indiana, you know what to do.
Yeah, run screamin' to the airport.
See ya, Woody.
Bye, Leonard.
You take care of her.
I will.
You better.
Are you okay, Woody?
Well, I feel pretty bad.
It hurts, but at least it's settled.
Now I can go back to bein' Woody Boyd again.
Oh, hey, Woody Boyd, what about Mrs. Clean in the back there?
Come on, you guys.
Take it easy.
She happens to be a very nice lady.
We had a good time tonight.
She talked about all kinds of interesting things: movies, sports How to get cat hair out of the drapes.
Good-bye, Woody.
Uh, no, Desiree, please, don't go.
I'm not stupid.
Don't pay any attention to them.
Look, I'm not exactly sure what happened here tonight.
Something tells me you got trapped into this.
So I'm gonna let you off the hook.
Now, look, when, when I talked to you earlier today, I admit I thought you were somebody else.
But I had fun tonight.
I like you.
I guess what I'm tryin' to say is I need somebody to talk to.
What'd you have in mind?
I don't know.
I, uh, thought maybe a cup of coffee.
Sure.
Why not?
This isn't gonna turn into one of those May/December romances, is it?
Well, with the holidays comin' up, December's no good, but May's okay.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
Hey, wow, Sammy!
Woody, Woody, Woody, jump up there and fix the TV.
again, will you?
Whoa, whoa!
Perfect, Perfect!
Don't move!
Oh, wait a second, Woody-- uh, just a just a minor adjustment.
That's it!
Oh, I sure hope this game doesn't go into overtime.
Making your way in the world today Takes everything you've got Taking a break from all your worries Sure would help a lot Wouldn't you like to get away Sometimes you want to go Where everybody knows your name And they're always glad you came You want to be where you can see Our troubles are all the same You want to be where everybody knows your name You want to go where people know People are all the same You want to go where everybody knows your name.
Sam, here's your change.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, dear.
What?
I can't remember whether or not I left my stove on.
Oh, boy.
No, it's off.
A-ha.
I think.
It's off.
Of course it's off.
It's on.
My apartment's on fire.
Still Go, go, go, go, go.
Oh, wait, uh, before you go, uh, while you were up there at Melville's a Madame Likova called.
Something about showing up tonight with, uh, a videotape and analysis?
Here?
Madame Likova?
Yeah.
Well, we've got to get this place cleaned up.
Everyone, out!
What's the big deal?
Who is she?
What?
Well, she Promise me, all of you, that you won't make fun of me.
Yeah, right.
Hey Carla, come on.
No, we, uh, we won't make fun of you, we promise.
I've been studying ballet.
Sam!
You laughed.
No, no, we just, uh, all thought of a joke.
What joke?
You in a tutu.
Come on.
What is this?
Come on.
Tell us all about it.
Madame Likova has been visiting Boston and she consented to teach a class at the college.
On a caprice, I decided to enroll and I was accepted.
Our final session entailed doing a solo performance on videotape.
Oh, I get it-- that way she could puke in the privacy of her own home.
Diane, uh, why the sudden interest in ballet?
Oh, Norman, it's not sudden.
I've had an on-again, off-again love affair with the ballet since I was seven years old.
I studied for a while, then gave it up.
Regrettably, of course.
Although I was blessed with a swan-like neck and natural grace I abandoned my dream of becoming a prima ballerina and concentrated instead on my career as a novelist.
Which explains why you're here in a bar pushing beers.
Oh, I remember the first time I ever put on my toe shoes Excuse me, Diane.
Isn't your apartment on fire?
Oh, my God!
I completely forgot!
My poor kitty.
Wait a minute.
I'm sure I turned it off.
Hi, Cliff.
Hey, Diane.
Hi, everybody.
Sammy?
Hey!
Mind if I put one of these up on the old, uh, bulletin board?
Go ahead.
Ah, better take this old one of mine down, huh?
Boy, oh, boy, nobody was interested in my singles potluck sÃ©ance.
What's going up this time?
Well, you know, for years I've been saving up and, uh, finally made it.
I bought myself a snazzy Italian sports car.
Yup.
As of tomorrow I'm going to be the owner of a brand new Alfredo.
Hey, all right.
But first I got to, uh, sell off the old Cliff-mobile.
Wait a minute.
Now you own a 1965 Chevy station wagon, right?
Yes, sir.
This is a picture of a Rolls-Royce.
What are you doing?
Uh, read the copy there, Sammy.
"Chevy, the Rolls-Royce of station wagons".
Oh, come on.
Smart.
Um, ex excuse me.
Yeah?
I'm looking for Diane Chambers.
Oh, she's not here right now.
Oh, I'll bet you, you're Madame Lik Likova.
Oh!
Oh, goodness no.
No.
How Madame would laugh if she heard you say that.
And then she would strike me.
No, I, I am Leeza, her assistant.
Oh, Sam Malone, hi.
Hello.
Hello.
Frasier Crane.
Hello.
Uh, well, is Madame going to come here later on tonight?
Oh, no, no, Madame Likova would never come to a tavern.
No, I am bringing by the tape and analysis for Diane.
Normally the students pick them up themselves, but, well, Madame Likova can be very harsh, so I wanted to soften the blow by bringing them here myself.
Her dancing's that bad, huh?
I am afraid so.
That is why I, I, I wanted to come here myself and, and tell her not to dance anymore.
Uh, but I, I have to go now.
Uh, we are checking out tonight.
And an impatient Madame Likova is a dangerous Madame Likova.
Oh.
Uh, give her this videotape and this envelope and tell her I'm so sorry.
Well, I will.
Thank you very much.
Yes, thank you.
Do Svidaniya.
"Do Svidaniya", huh?
Those Russkies can never leave without slipping in some Soviet propaganda.
Hey, you guys think, uh, Diane is really that bad of a dancer?
I don't know.
Guess there's no way of ever knowing, is there?
Yeah, none that I can really think of.
Me, uh, neither.
And who knows if that VCR in Sammy's office even works, you know?
There's, uh, there's only one way to find out, you know.
How's that?
Get a tape and, uh, slip it right in there.
Talk about luck.
Here's a tape right here.
That's extremely insensitive.
No, it's not.
No, it's not.
It's like driving by the scene of an accident.
You don't want to look, but you just can't help yourself.
Yeah, and in this case you get to play it over and over again.
Is it working?
Guess so.
Hey, that's Miss Chambers.
Oh, boy.
Why is she hopping around like that?
Well, she's dancing, Woody.
Get out!
I don't know, guys.
You know, maybe this isn't funny.
Sam, are you looking at the screen?
I-I-I'm sorry.
I'm just  Being laughed at is going to be the least of Diane's worries.
If she ever reads this analysis, she's going to be shattered.
Take a look at this thing.
Oh, boy.
"Poor, poor, poor, terrible" Ooh, how was her attendance?
What I mean, what are we gonna do?
She thinks her teacher's going to show up tonight.
Uh, what are we going to tell her?
We're not going to tell her anything.
Madame Likova is going to write her a splendid analysis.
Can I borrow your office?
Oh, hey, now wait a second now.
Do you think this is the right way to do it?
Oh, listen, what harm can it do?
I mean, she said this was a one-shot deal.
Why not let her leave it a winner?
Uh, why would you, her favorite doormat, want to make her feel better about herself?
Oh, I hear what you're saying.
Yeah, sure, she mocked me, debased me, humiliated me, ridiculed me, finally left me at the altar, but you never really can forget your first love, can you?
Back again.
And you'll all be happy to know that my oven was off.
Ah!
But I had left the milk out, so it wasn't a wasted trip.
Uh, Diane, while you were out, your, uh, dance teacher's assistant came by.
Oh, poo.
Madame Likova didn't come?
No, no, uh, she got hold of a bad bowl of borscht.
Uh but she, she, uh, told us to make sure you got this.
Here it is.
Yeah.
The moment of truth.
Mm Oh, I can't.
Oh, oh, come on.
You, you're going to have to open it sometime.
"Technique: very good.
"Strength: very good.
"Emotional response: outstanding.
Flexibility: average"?
Well, I always thought I was very flexible.
"Excellent natural instincts".
"Soul of a dancer".
"If not for the late start, could have had a career in dance".
Oh, my.
Oh, I'd love to call her and thank her.
Maybe I can still catch her at the hotel.
Oh, no, no, Diane, I don't think that's a good idea at all.
Why not?
Why not?
Why not?
Because, uh, because Well, uh, you know, she's probably packing and if you disturb her right now, she'd probably put, uh, her, her work clothes in one bag and her regular stuff in another bag.
Then if the airline lost one of those bags, then she, you know, either she wouldn't be able to work or she'd look real goofy out there on the street.
That's why not.
Is there something you're not telling me?
No!
Ha!
No.
We're just, uh What are we doing here?
Uh, well, we're, ha, we're horsing around.
Horsing around, huh?
No, listen.
The fact is we're all just thrilled to death about the report.
Now you go ahead and call her.
I'm out of here, fellas.
Sit.
Ah, yes, Madame Likova, please.
Oh, boy  Oh, I see.
She's busy, huh?
Well, maybe Oh, Madame Likova!
Madame Likova!
Yes, yes.
This is Diane Chambers.
I'm, I'm so glad I caught you.
I Yes.
Yes, Madame Likova.
I read it.
I Did you really mean everything you said?
Ah, yes, I'm sorry.
I know you always mean what you say.
Hello?
She hung up.
Well, she was never one to chat.
This is unbelievable.
Mmm.
I never thought I was this good.
Maybe I've been too critical of myself.
I really don't think that's possible.
I must view my tape again-- through Madame's eyes.
Would any of you mind, if?
Mind?
We'd be angry if you didn't.
Oh, my friends.
I'm, I'm so glad you're all here to share this moment with me.
I tell you what.
What don't you come and stand right up close to the television here?
Oh, okay.
So you get the best possible viewing, and we'll just sort of surround you behind you so we don't distract you, all right?
Hit it!
Yes, yes.
Look at me.
Ever since I was a child, I wanted to dance so badly.
Ooh, looks like you got your wish.
Norman, don't you think it's time you got home to your beloved?
No, no, it's, uh, Vera's night to howl tonight.
She's, uh, hosting a Tupperware party.
I'd say, uh, right about now they're probably knee-deep in lettuce crispers.
Vera's really into Tupperware?
Are you kidding?
She wants to be buried in one of those things.
I can just, uh, see the service.
You know, they lower you into the ground, somebody burps the corner and you're sealed fresh for eternity, I guess.
Oh Was that a sigh, Diane?
I don't know.
Come on.
What's the matter?
Come on.
Nothing.
You mentioned eternity, and it got me to thinking.
"For of all the sad words of tongue or pen, The saddest are these: It might have been".
Yeah.
I wonder what might have happened if I had pursued my dream.
Who knows?
I might have ended up an accomplished ballerina.
Now I'll never know.
Yeah, that is tough, but, uh, well, that's what you get for dreaming.
Didn't you ever have a dream, Norman?
No.
Not at all?
Nope.
You never wanted something that was out of reach?
Well, uh beer nuts.
Norman, I'm serious.
So am I. Could you just Yeah.
Everyone has dreams, Norman.
Everyone except me.
I learned early in life not to have 'em.
Oh Yeah!
I figure they're useless.
They don't come true anyway.
Norman Yeah, life's tough enough without getting yourself all worked up over something that's not gonna happen.
Mm-mm.
Dreams-- they just give you heartache.
But isn't the real heartache knowing that you had the potential to do something and you never tried?
Listen to me.
Listen to me!
Do I have another choice?
I have the potential to be a dancer.
I still have a fighting chance to make my dream come true.
I'm gonna send my tape to Boston Ballet.
You know In fact, I am going to drop it in the mail tonight.
I, uh Oh, Norman Diane?
Oh, this is so wonderful.
Well Thank you so much.
Um I'm too excited to stick around.
Anyway, you know how to lock up, right, Norman?
You kidding?
I'm the one who taught you.
Right.
Good night.
Yeah.
Well.
Ah, alone in a bar.
Maybe Diane is right.
I guess dreams can come true.
Hello, everyone.
My!
Don't you look the ballerina.
Thank you, Carla.
Now, why don't you take a flying leap?
Sam, the reason I came early was to tell you that I'm going to be a little late.
You're not early.
You're right on time.
Oh.
Well, then, I'm going to be quite late.
I'm auditioning for Boston Ballet.
Would you mind if I warmed up?
This seems a tad high, but it might serve as a barre.
Well, it is a bar, Miss Chambers.
No, Woody, when a dancer warms up, they hold onto a barre.
That is a bar.
If I might interrupt here, uh Please.
Diane, what audition?
Well, you know I sent off my tape to Boston Ballet.
Yeah.
What audition?
Well, they had the nerve to send it back unopened.
They never even looked at it.
I think that's patently unfair.
Is that giving art a chance?
Well, uh, Diane, do you think, uh, maybe you're just not ready for the Boston Ballet?
Hmm?
Yes, I am.
I know it.
Madame Likova knows it.
The only people who don't know it are the people at Boston Ballet, and they're about to find out.
They're rehearsing now.
They're going to see me if I have to do a grand jet?
over the gate.
Uh, Diane, I think that might be a mistake.
Why?
Don't you think I'm good enough?
Oh, no.
Oh, hey, are you kidding me?
I think you're wonderful.
Heh.
So what's the point?
Um, Frasier, the point?
The point is You know you two have been behaving very mysteriously lately.
Oh Are you planning a surprise party?
: You're onto us.
Darn!
Oh Well, I will try to act surprised.
Oh.
Well, that's great, but as I was saying, Diane, the point is well, not to make a big scene about this thing.
You see, I-I'm sure the Boston Ballet must have, uh, open auditions, you know, from time to time.
Why not, uh, wait till then?
I've wasted enough time already.
Thank you.
No, wait, Di-Diane, wait a second here.
Uh, oh, boy.
Listen, I-I'm going to  I-I'm going to have to tell you something, and, uh, you may not like it.
You see, the-the truth the truth is that Sam, I know what it is.
You're afraid of losing me to the world of ballet.
No, no, see, that's See, that's not what I'm afraid of at all.
Oh, my plucky little man.
I-I-I Whoo, boy!
I'm just going to have to come right out and, uh, say this.
Uh, I-I hope I don't hurt your feelings here, um Please, please, please, don't do this.
Help me here, Frasier.
Diane, please, please, please, don't do this.
Sam this is one of the most genuine displays of affection you've ever shown me.
With love like this in my corner, how could I possibly fail?
Yeah, well Hmm Frasier, she's not going to believe me.
Tell her.
Come on, tell her.
Diane, Diane, just a second.
There's something I've got to get off my chest.
Uh Yes, Frasier?
Knock 'em dead.
Thank you.
What?
!
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Excuse me!
Miss, we're in the middle of a rehearsal.
Yes, yes, and-and you're all very wonderful, but I have something I'd like to say.
Miss, please This will only take a second.
Hold it, everybody.
Oh, you may put her down.
Kirby, please show the lady to the wings.
Oh, no, no, please.
I must prove to you that I indeed belong in your fine fraternity.
Kirby!
I'm sorry, miss, but we just don't have time for this right now.
I don't have much time myself.
A dancer's career is not a long one.
I'm sorry, but it's true.
I have a dream: to be a dancer.
And in order for it to come true, you must see me dance.
Oh, yes, my technique is not quite as polished as it should be, but is that all there is to art?
Mere technique?
Or is it not the passion and emotion and pain that lie deep within our souls?
For I have that emotion.
I have felt that pain.
I I am a feeling person, and I can communicate those feelings to you through dance, so judge me not by what my arms and legs are doing.
Judge me by what I make you feel.
No, most importantly, judge me for I must dance.
Damn it, I must!
Well Oh!
Thank you!
You won't be disappointed.
Oh, oh!
SAM : Psst!
Hey!
Never mind.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
Hey, fellas, do me a favor.
You guys have had a few drinks.
Sit down.
Let me buy you some coffee.
Aw, th-thanks anyway, Sam, but everything's under control.
Pete hasn't had a thing to drink all night.
He's our designated driver.
Oh, I'm glad to hear it.
That's a good idea, Pete.
I'm not the designated driver.
I thought you were.
No, no, I-I'm not the designated driver.
What about you, Mark?
I'm with Sam.
I think we ought to try it sometime.
Wait right here.
I'm gonna call you a cab.
Speaking of driving someone home, since you've been drinking, I'd be happy to give you a lift.
Oh, thanks, but, uh, all I've been drinking is soda water.
Oh.
Well, in that case, Woody, make me a double martini.
One of us is getting driven home tonight.
Making your way in the world today Takes everything you've got Taking a break from all your worries Sure would help a lot Wouldn't you like to get away Sometimes you want to go Where everybody knows your name And they're always glad you came You want to be where you can see Our troubles are all the same You want to be where everybody knows your name You want to go where people know People are all the same You want to go where everybody knows your name.
Afternoon, everybody.
Norm!
How are you today, Mr. Peterson?
Never been better, Woody.
You know, just once I'd like to be better.
What's the matter there, Normie?
You look a little, uh, down in the mouth, huh?
I don't know, Cliff.
There's something missing from my life, I think.
I mean, sure, I got, you know, the nice wife, uh, career, a house, but I guess I'm talking about that spiritual something that can kind of give it all meaning, you know?
Enable me to be at peace with myself and the world.
Uh, The Miss Teeny Bikini Beauty Pageant's on tonight.
Well, that ought to do it.
Da dum la de da dum La de da dum Oh, isn't it a glorious day?
Well, it sure is, Miss Chambers.
Especially if you like it cloudy and damp.
Woody, I'm not talking about superficial things, like the weather.
I'm talking about the day.
Today is going to be the most special day of my life.
Do you believe in intuition?
No.
But I have this strange feeling that someday I will.
Hi, guys.
Hey, Sammy!
What's the matter?
You got a weird look on your face.
I don't know if I should tell you.
Well, let me help you out.
Don't.
Well, Sam, this morning I woke up with the most overwhelming feeling that you would propose to me today.
Whew.
Talk about fate.
Talk about coincidence.
You have the same feeling?
No, I just wish you'd talk about fate or coincidence.
Anything but marriage.
Look, I am not gonna propose to you, Diane.
I know this sounds crazy.
It's not like me to be given to mystical nonsense, but the feeling is so strong.
It's an absolute certainty.
Well, if it's fate, it's fate.
Diane, will you do me the honor of becoming my w-w-waitress?
Pretty good, huh?
Sam, will you give me a Cutty rocks?
Did you hear that?
Diane said she woke up with this feeling that I'm gonna propose to her.
The stupidest thing I've ever heard.
Don't ever make fun of a woman when she says she has a feeling about something.
Sammy, you're tampering with the psychic world here, and you're gonna be sorry.
Oh, come on.
No, no, no, I'm serious.
It has to do with a woman's cycle.
See, somehow it's plugged into the supernatural.
Oh, you're being ridiculous.
No, no, Sammy, please.
Come here.
Please.
What?
Just promise me you'll be careful.
Okay, I'll be careful.
Thank you.
Oh, oh, oh, my God!
What?
Ooh!
What?
Something's happened to me here.
What?
Carla, get Diane over here.
I'm gonna ask her to marry me buddy Norm!
Oh!
That's twice, man.
Hey, there, Sammy!
Today's my big day!
All right, Tom.
Will you marry me?
The results of the last bar exam are due out, and I'm feeling lucky.
Hey, you know what they say, eleventh time's the charm.
Okay, okay, okay, I had a few problems in the past.
But this time, I really nailed it.
Tell me, Tom, is the a free Big Gulp with every, uh, law degree?
Hey, Tom, how come you're not downtown waiting for the old results, huh?
I got a friend calling me here when they're posted.
But I got a hunch I did pretty well this time.
Yeah, like General Custer had a hunch that the Little Big Horn was a gift shop and picnic grounds, huh?
Hey, hey, lay off.
The guy's worked hard.
Woody, how about a beer for our future barrister here?
Okay?
Thank you, Norm.
All right.
So what, uh, what kind of law are you gonna specialize in there, Tom?
Specialize?
So a free Big Gulp, you say, huh?
Sam, it doesn't have to be a formal proposal.
Excuse me?
Well, we've already gone the traditional route, and I know how you loathe long sentences.
I know you think I'm gonna propose to you.
But, trust me, it's not gonna happen.
Before I ask you to marry me, Diane, there'll be snowflakes in hell, pigs will fly, Norm will hate beer Hey, everybody, I'm an attorney!
Nah.
TV  Thank you, Barbara G. Bridleton, Miss Teeny Bikini, South Dakota.
Well, that's it.
I think Miss Arkansas has got it hands down.
In your hat, Miss Arkansas.
Miss Nebraska's the class of this field.
Oh, yeah, Miss Nebraska.
I was particularly impressed by her life's ambition to work for world peace and open an aerobics dance studio.
Now, wait a minute.
Look at this one here.
Ooh, yeah.
Not that often you see an impression of Edward G. Robinson while twirling a baton.
Hey, Woody, Miss Indiana.
Yeah, but Boston's my home now.
Dum dum da da da da da De da da da de.
Anytime you're ready, Sam.
Gee, I'd love to propose to you, Diane, but I'm tied up kind of for the rest of my life.
Deep down inside, you know this is going to happen.
You're going to propose to me.
You say that every day.
But I don't say this every day.
It's today.
That is one scary woman.
Sammy, come on.
It's late.
It's time to go home.
It's my turn to lock up.
Besides, you look tired.
You need your rest.
And you might do something stupid that you'll regret for the rest of your life.
Go on.
Would you relax, please?
Do I look like a guy who's about to do something stupid?
Always.
That's not the point, Sam.
Leave me alone, will ya?
Guys, I'm gonna I'm gonna lock up now.
Yeah, all right, Sammy.
We can watch the rest of this meat show over at Normie's house.
No, no, no.
No, no, no.
Vera won't let me watch those, uh, beauty contests, Cliffie.
Yeah?
How come?
Well, sheshe's says they're degrading to women and they make me randy as a jackrabbit.
Woody, you go on home.
I'll finish up here.
I want to be alone with Sam.
Run, Sam, run!
Diane, don't you think You know, on second thought, guys, why don't you take off?
I'd like to have a little private moment here with Diane.
That's it!
It is all over!
Now I don't have the strength to fight anymore.
All chance of victory is gone.
The only thing for me now is to go home, pick up the pieces of my shattered life, and try to go on.
Good night, Miss Chambers.
And, uh, good luck.
Oh, thanks, Woody.
But since Sam and I are destined to be married, luck is the one thing we don't need.
Oh.
Well, how about a salad bowl?
Yes, that would be nice.
Great.
You saved me some shopping.
Good night, Woody.
Good night, Sammy.
Good night, Woody.
Well, Sam, you clever boy.
Since you've arranged for us to be alone, I'm all ears.
But you better hurry.
Almost midnight.
I wanted to talk to you alone 'cause I didn't want to embarrass you in in front of the other people.
Sit down, will you, please?
Look, Diane I want you to stop this nonsense about me proposing to you.
About us being married.
About us getting about us period.
I've had it.
That's it.
I don't want to hear any more.
Yes, Sam, fine, fine, but you really should get at it, okay?
Would you stop it, please?
Man, you're making me nuts!
This is exactly what I'm talking about!
You know, all right, it was fun for a while, like a little game, but it's not cute anymore.
It's serious, Diane.
You know, I-I was really ticked off at first when you turned me down.
But now I see how smart you were.
I am never gonna ask you to marry me again.
Can I be any more clear than this?
I'm never gonna ask you to marry me again.
Oh, no, oh, no, no, come on, Oh, no, no!
No, no, no, no, stop that!
Listen, you know how much I hate it when you cry.
But I know you know, so it's not gonna work.
Forget it.
This really hadn't occurred to me but I guess it's actually a possibility.
I'm not listening.
Uh-uh.
Maybe you don't love me.
: God in heaven, it's not possible!
Nothing!
That's it!
It's not affecting me at all.
I'm immune to this stuff.
Yeah, you're not gonna soften me up.
No way.
That's it.
You know, it's not gonna make me feel sorry for you.
In fact, I'll tell you what it's gonna make me do.
You want to know what it's gonna make me do?
I'm gonna tell you what it's gonna make me do.
It's gonna make me propose to you, is what it's gonna do.
Oh, come on, don'tdon't cry.
Oh, Diane, will you marry me?
No, Sam.
The Lord is my Shepherd; I shall not want.
In verdant pastures, He gives me repose.
Beside restful waters, He leads me.
He refreshes my soul Oh, Warden, have you heard from the governor yet?
I'm sorry, Sam.
Oh, well.
He maketh me lie down in green pastures; He leadeth me beside the still waters.
He restoreth my soul; He leadeth me in the paths of ri Father, do you really believe in the afterlife?
Yes, my son, I do.
Well, good.
Maybe I can find her there, and get her again!
Mmm-mmm!
Ooh!
What's wrong?
Mmm.
Oh I just had a flash that I got the electric chair for killing you.
Well, that's silly.
Massachusetts doesn't have the death penalty.
What?
Uh Nothing.
Nothing at all.
No death penalty, huh?
No, not at present, but I'm-I'm sure they're going to reinstate it.
In fact, I'm on my way to campaign for it at this very moment.
Excuse me.
Hey, everybody, you're not going to believe this.
Well, you passed the bar.
I'll believe anything.
Yeah?
Well, Sam's in jail, smarty pants.
What?
Yeah.
Diane had him arrested for assault and battery.
My hero.
Is Diane all right?
I think she's fine.
I just don't have all the details.
Well, how do you know all this stuff?
Sam called me to retain my services.
Oh, to do what, prune his trees?
Has he been arraigned yet?
No, 2:00.
Well, maybe we ought to go down to the courthouse in case Sammy needs character witnesses.
No, they don't do that until the trial, Carla.
Well, what sort of defense you plan on using?
I'm thinking about pleading insanity.
Yeah, yeah, that's a good idea.
What about Sammy?
Bail is set at $2,500.
Next case.
Your Honor, I swear I never touched her.
Take a seat.
Case number one five seven eight six-- the Commonwealth of Massachusetts versus Sam Malone.
Defendant is charged with willful assault  Oh, what is this?
I swear I never laid a hand on her, Your Honor.
Mr. Malone I'm sorry, Your Honor.
Just take a seat, Miss Chambers.
Thank you.
The defendant is charged with willful assault and battery against the person of one Diane Chambers.
How does the defendant plead?
Not guilty.
Motions, gentlemen.
Your Honor, due to the violent circumstances of this crime, and in order to protect the victim from a reoccurrence of the events of evening last, the State recommends that bail be set at an amount commensurate with the serious nature of this offense.
Motion denied.
Hey!
I'm the one that's supposed to say that.
Right, right.
Sorry, Your Honor, uh, it's my first case.
You're kidding!
Your Honor, my client, uh, has no prior convictions or arrests.
A well-known businessman and respected member of this community.
I therefore move that bail be waived and he be released on his own recognizance.
I don't think Mr. Malone poses any general threat to the community; so moved.
All right!
Sorry, Your Honor.
Trial is set for two months from this date at 10:00 a.m. All right, everybody, it's been a long day.
This court will reconvene tomorrow morning.
Your Honor?
Yes, Miss, uh Chambers?
Would it be all right if I said something at this time?
I don't think that's really necessary.
I think it might help to expedite matters.
Well, if you must, but please be brief.
Oh, geez!
Your Honor, I just want you to know Should I come up there?
Why not?
Your Honor, I, I just want you to know that I understand why the accused-- and, by the way, the man I intend to marry-- was, uh, was upset last night.
After all, I did just turn down his proposal of marriage.
I see.
But if you intend to marry him, why did you say no to his proposal?
It's a long story.
Make it a short one, and maybe we can save the good people of Massachusetts the cost of a trial.
Well, let's see.
Um, the accused and I have been going together on and off for about four years.
I guess you could describe our relationship as a bit stormy, but that's also part of its excitement.
Earlier this year, the accused proposed to me.
I said no because I thought he was on the rebound from another relationship.
I was wrong, so I changed my mind.
But he wouldn't propose to me again, the little dickens.
Until last night, that is, but this time I fear he was only asking me to marry him because I was crying and upset albeit unintentional.
It was emotional blackmail on my part.
I couldn't say yes under those circumstances.
You do understand, don't you, Your Honor?
I'm sorry, I was just trying to imagine the long version of the story.
Although gallant, his proposal couldn't have been sincere.
The accused was merely respons Hey, will you say my na Sam, my name is Sam.
Make her say my name, will you please?
Calm down, Mr. Malone.
Go on, Miss Chambers.
Well, the next thing I know, the acc Sam is chasing me down the street-- for six blocks, to be exact-- until I tripped and fell thus sustaining my injuries, a bruised thigh and a wrenched neck.
Did he hit you or push you in any way?
Well, no.
Not exactly.
Look, Miss Chambers, it doesn't appear that Mr. Malone is directly responsible for your injuries.
Now, is there any way I could persuade you to drop the charges against him?
I have a solution, if it pleases the court.
If you can get us out of this, it absolutely thrills the court.
What if my client proposes to her again?
Yes, I could alwa Are you crazy?
!
I like the idea.
Does the State have any objections to his proposing?
None, Your Honor.
How about it, Miss Chambers?
This all right with you?
I suppose it would be all right if it were a sincere proposal.
Well, I guess it's your move, Mr. Malone.
You mean, I have to propose to her to keep from going to jail where I wouldn't be going in the first place if she'd said yes to any one of my three proposals?
That's a very ironic way of putting it.
Now, which is it going to be, a wedding or a trial?
How long would I have to be in jail?
Diane, will you marry me?
That didn't sound very sincere.
I ask the court, did that sound sincere?
No, it didn't.
Try again.
Y-You, you have no idea what you're sentencing me to.
Mr. Malone, come up here and let's get this over with.
Diane will you marry me?
Okay.
Case dismissed.
Congratulations.
All rise.
What do you know?
I got you off!
Thank you, Tom.
Yeah, Yeah, all in a day's work, Sammy, my boy.
You're looking at Thomas Babson, Esquire undefeated.
Oh, Tom?
Uh, if you got any time next week, my trees need pruning.
How about Saturday?
Be fine; thanks.
Well, guess I don't need this for a while.
Sam I'm sorry.
I guess I got a little carried away.
I wanted to expose our relationship to the scrutiny of the court.
God knows I've tried to figure it out.
I'm at a complete loss.
Oh, it makes perfect sense to me.
You want me to propose to you.
I propose to you.
You say no, I say fine, I never want to see you again.
You drive me nuts telling me you want me to propose again.
I do, you turn me down.
Next thing I know, I'm in a court of law where I've got to propose to you or I'll go to jail.
It's the classic American love story.
That's pretty absurd.
Well, don't worry.
I'm not going to hold you to that proposal.
I know it was made under duress.
Bye, Sam.
Where are you going?
You know, you're not going to get off that easy.
No, you're going to pay for what you put me through.
What do you mean?
I proposed to you, you said yes.
Now, they can stop me from killing you, but they can't stop me from marrying you.
Oh, Sam!
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
Here's something about a show of impressionists coming to Boston this fall.
Well, why wait?
I do one that'll knock your socks off.
He's talkin' about French painters, doofus.
Yeah?
Well, so am I. Yeah, I do a great Cezanne.
Get outta here.
No, I do.
Watch this.
: Hosey, posey, life is perfect.
: Hey, ya better smile when ya say that, Pilgrim.
: Now, now, now, now, just a-just a darned second there, young fella.
Okay, okay, I got one.
Watch this.
: Hey, fellers.
I believe we might be in for just a little rain before this day's over.
Woody, who is that?
It's Dwight Womack, mayor of Hanover, Indiana.
No, Woody, Woody, when you do impressions, you gotta do impressions of famous people.
Well, if I could do somebody famous, why would I be doin' Dwight Womack?
Yeah, good point.
Yeah, he's got a point.
Making your way in the world today Takes everything you've got Taking a break from all your worries Sure would help a lot Wouldn't you like to get away Sometimes you want to go Where everybody knows your name And they're always glad you came You want to be where you can see Our troubles are all the same You want to be where everybody knows your name You want to go where people know People are all the same Ã¢â¢Âª You want to go where everybody knows your name.
Ã¢â¢Âª Hey, everybody.
Sam?
This is our first time back in Cheers since, you know, yesterday.
Don't you think we should announce our engagement?
Oh.
All right.
Okay.
Go ahead.
Go ahead.
Oh, no, no, you do it.
You're the man.
All right, listen up, everybody.
I have an announcement to make here.
Uh, Diane and I decided to Oh, Sam,  what are you going to say?
Well, I was just going to tell them  I see.
Well, what do you want me to say?
Oh, come on, Diane, nobody knows who the Lunts are.
Due to our desire to be-- what?
Conjoined.
Conjoined, uh hey, well, Diane and I, uh, would like you to, uh, celebrate with us by, uh, toasting our nuptials.
Ouch.
No, no, Woody, it's, uh What Sam so eloquently expressed was that he and I have officially become engaged to be married.
How about that Al, huh?
Oh, marriage, Sam.
I thought you'd said you'd never marry Diane.
Well, I-I never, uh, said that exactly.
No, no, I think the exact words were "I'd rather have every hair on my body pulled out simultaneously".
Well, that-that's just an expression.
I mean No, seriously, you know, we all knew it was going to happen sooner or later.
I just thought I'd get it over with.
Well, Diane, Sam, congratulations to both of you.
Diane, I hope you're planning to stay for the entire ceremony this time.
Ours was  Ours was very touching, I thought.
Well, another one bites the matrimonial dust.
I guess that leaves only one stud to satisfy all the babes in this bar.
Yeah, I can handle it, too.
Hi.
I bet you never thought you'd see the day, huh?
Nice shirt, Sam.
Is it new?
No, it's not.
It, uh Did you hear what I said up there about me and Diane getting engaged?
The beer distributor called.
He wants to know if he can change the delivery day to Wednesday.
Carla, I know that we haven't always seen eye-to-eye, but you could at least wish us well.
I need a draft.
Fascinating.
She's experiencing denial.
What's that mean, Dr. Crane?
Well, simply put, it means that the human mind blocks out that which it cannot emotionally accept.
What's that mean, Dr. Crane?
It means that you don't understand this, and you never will.
Oh.
I think perhaps I should get personally involved in this.
After all, Carla is a good friend.
I think I could help her alleviate her suffering.
Besides, there's nothing good on TV.
So I don't see any ring here.
What gives, you guys, huh?
Well, we're doing a little window shopping.
Yeah?
But she's got her eye on a big ol' diamond in the window of, uh, Barton and Lyles.
Yeah?
Oh, no, no, Sam.
Now that's much too expensive.
I would be content with any one of the smaller stones we saw today.
Oh, now wait a second.
Hey, Woody, give me the phone there, will ya?
Listen, you might as well have the best ring.
You got the best husband.
Hmm?
Is it any wonder I love you?
I'm twice blessed.
I'm getting the most wonderful guy and one helluva rock.
Yeah, let me, uh, let me find out just how much this thing is here.
Yeah, find out there, Sammy.
Hi, uh, you got a ring in the window there by the door?
It's a big diamond with two little diamonds on either side there.
Yeah, uh, that's the one.
Yeah, how-how much does that cost?
How much?
Fifty-two hundred.
Boy, what am I going to do here?
Bruce.
What?
Friend of mine in the jewelry business.
He buys diamonds and gold wholesale and then you don't have to pay the markup, which is like a zillion percent.
Oh, you know, that-that's kinda silly.
No, no.
It's the same gold, same diamonds.
Well, if it's the same ring, it's the same ring.
Absolutely.
Give me the phone.
All right.
Yeah, I'll call the guy.
Yeah, do it, do it.
Uh, Sam, I don't think that's a good idea.
Why not?
Diane's not the kind of woman who'd like to find out that her ring was bought from a jeweler who begins every transaction with, "Psst, buddy".
Oh, no, you make you're makin' it sound worse than it is.
I mean, I'm sure everything's legit.
All right, fine, Bruce.
Great.
Psst, Sammy, come here.
Dee-daa.
Huh?
Not bad for 1,200 bucks, huh?
Wow, I'll say.
Hey, Carla, you, uh, see the ring that Sammy got for Diane here?
You know, I'm thinking about having my house texture-coated.
You have your choice of 24 decorator colors.
Amazing.
Yeah, and surprisingly reasonable.
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, you guys, you want to see a classic?
Here, watch.
Hi, Diane.
Hi, Sam.
Oh boy, hey, you know, that finger looks a little warm there.
Maybe you should cool it down with some ice.
: Sam.
What?
What?
What's the matter?
What's wrong?
Nothing.
It's beautiful.
Oh.
Oh.
Just think, hours ago, I was admiring this magnificent ring in the window, thinking it was an unattainable treasure.
And now, here it is on my finger.
Yep, there it is, all right.
That's the one.
How about that, huh?
Oh, thank you, thank you.
Well, yeah  Thank you.
Yeah.
You're welcome.
Hey, uh, Carla, do you realize that when Sammy and Diane get married, uh, Diane's going to be your boss?
Nice shirt, Norm.
Is it new?
Sam I felt that I couldn't possibly ask you for this, but now that you've actually gone out and purchased it, I can tell you.
This is the only ring I ever wanted.
Mmm.
Where's the box?
Box?
Yeah, you know, the one it came in.
Oh, yeah, uh this, this one didn't seem to come with one of those, did it?
Really?
Oh, I'm surprised they didn't give you one, especially considering how much this must have cost.
Oh, well, they did, they did.
It's just that I told them, uh, keep the box.
She'll just wear it.
That's what I said, all right.
Sam?
Yeah.
This may sound frivolous, but every woman wants to keep the box that her engagement ring came in.
I already have a space reserved for it in my memento drawer, right between my French Club pin and my retainer.
All right, all right.
I mean, fine, honey, I'll just, uh, go on, go back, and, uh I'll get the box.
Uh, don't forget your receipt there, Sammy.
Ah, they'll probably remember your face.
You can relax, everybody.
Got the box.
All right, Sammy.
They just, uh, gave it to ya, huh?
No, no, I had to buy something.
Oh, yeah?
Wha, wha, what'd you get?
Sterling silver corncob holders.
Do you believe that?
Wow.
Why'd you buy those things?
Well, everything else seemed like such a rip-off.
I'm still way ahead, though.
It's okay.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, sure.
Think about it.
Oh, Sam, there you are.
Yeah, and here you are, my little darling.
One ring box, just your size.
How 'bout that, huh?
You happy?
Delirious.
Oh, good.
I just wish I'd gone with you when you went back to Barton and Lyles.
I want to buy myself that dress.
Oh, which dress is that?
The one in the window.
Right next door in Justine's window.
Don't you remember?
I was admiring it as we walked by.
Oh, sure, sure, sure, yeah.
Yeah oh, it's perfect.
I'd love it.
Well, you know, it's kinda slack now.
Why don't ya take off?
Do a little shopping.
Really?
Yeah, go ahead.
Oh, Sam.
Uh.
I'll get my purse.
All right.
So, uh, Sammy when Diane sees the ring in the window of the fancy store and also on her finger, what do you think she'll say?
Well, I'm off.
Uh, no, Diane, uh, wait a second here.
Uh, I can't I can't let you go through with this.
What?
Well, uh, I, I bought that dress for ya.
Sam Malone Yeah.
I don't believe you.
No, it's a fact.
It's in my car right up there.
Oh, you scamp.
Oh, go get it, please.
Uh, you know, I I was kinda hopin' to surprise you with it.
Well, I already know about it now.
Right.
What am I standin' here for then, huh?
Oh Say, you know, that's, uh that was such an interesting dress.
How would you describe that color?
Pink.
Pink!
Right.
You always know the perfect word.
Pink.
Who woulda thought?
I wonder what's keeping Sam.
He's certainly been gone a long time.
Where is Sam?
"Where is Sam"?
: I think she's starting to relate to her environment again.
Well, I think we've made great progress.
Carla, can you tell me who Sam is?
Of course.
He's my boss.
Did you know that he is now engaged to be married?
Yes.
I'm very happy for him.
See how well we've done?
Carla who is the charming soul that has agreed to marry him?
Norm.
Well, I'm not the miracle worker.
Here we go.
The one you wanted and, uh, three more.
Oh, Sam!
What?
You impetuous fool.
Oh, I love them.
: Oh.
Oh, thank you.
Uh-huh.
Wait a minute.
You were gone an awfully long time.
I thought you were just going to your car.
Well, I got a-a parking ticket, and I, uh, I wanted to fight it in court.
Do I, uh, detect a snafu there, Sammy?
Every damn dress in the window was pink.
Oh, boy, that must have, uh, cost you a pretty penny.
That's all right.
I'll get some of it back.
She couldn't possibly like all four of them.
Oh, Sam, I love all of them.
I can't decide which one to wear tonight to dinner.
Oh, go oh, boy, uh, right.
What did we say, uh, 7:00?
Oh, could we make it a little later?
I have to stop by the store to get the ring appraised.
Pardon me?
The insurance man said that there has to be an appraisal on file in order to have this covered in my theft policy.
Boy, they, uh they don't make it easy, do they?
Uh, I'll tell you what.
Why don't you, uh, let me handle that?
I'll have it appraised.
Uh, why yeah, why don't you give me the ring?
Oh, no, Sam!
Just as our love is forever, so is this ring.
From here on out, it will never leave my finger.
Beautiful.
That's really beautiful.
Woody, you want to get me some aspirin there?
Sam, I think this has gone too far.
You're caught in a quagmire of deceit.
You're just going to sink deeper and deeper, and to what avail?
To my butt's avail.
Yeah, maybe you're right.
Maybe I should just bite the bullet and be honest with her.
I mean, I really want this relationship to work.
We do, too, Sammy.
Uh, Diane?
Yes.
I, uh, I have something I want to say to you.
Uh, I'm afraid you're not going to like it.
After receiving this beautiful symbol of our relationship-- a symbol that has touched me very deeply-- nothing you say could ever disappoint me.
What is it?
I have to go to the doctor.
What for?
No, it's nothing serious.
It's, uh I just figured that, you know, we-we're getting married.
Uh, I might as well have a check-up and make sure the old Evinrude's still cranking.
I don't see any cause for alarm in that.
No.
In fact, I think it's quite sensible.
Good, good.
I love the dresses.
Oh, me, too.
Thanks so much.
Lovely.
So, uh, what now, Kemo Sammy?
It's no problem.
It's no problem.
I'll just, uh I'll go back to the store and I'll I'll handle it.
Tell you, though no way in the world am I going to buy that expensive ring.
The ring is bought.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, you shelled out for the ring in the window, didn't you, Sammy?
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
I got a real interesting price on it.
Full price?
Right around there, yeah.
As soon as I switch this one for the ring on her finger, my problems are over.
Oh, Sam, what did the doctor say?
Same thing he always does: "Wow"!
But you're fine, yes?
Oh, yeah, no problem there.
No, uh You know, actually, I-I was sitting in the, uh, waiting room there, and I, uh, realized that, uh, I had never officially put that ring on your finger, and I'd well, I'd kind of like to.
Sam, you're just sweeping me off my feet.
Um, okay, well, uh, close your eyes.
Why?
Uh, well, there, uh there-there's something I want to say to you, and, uh, I might get embarrassed if-if you saw me say it.
Okay.
All right.
I can't wait to hear this.
Right Diane you're really neat.
I think this big step we've taken has made you positively goofy.
Well, maybe it has.
That's me-- just one big goof.
Yeah, they, uh they haven't found a chick that can outsmart me.
All right, Sammy.
Did he say "chick" or "chimp"?
Cheers.
Uh, no, I'm sorry.
Norman is uncharacteristically absent.
May I take a message for him?
Uh-huh.
Bruce wants to know about the ring?
Mm-hmm.
Uh-huh Yes, I think it's safe to say that Sam's fiancÃ©e was completely fooled by it.
Boy, I'm starved.
I hear it's a great restaurant.
You're quite the little chatterbox tonight.
Oh, you want me to talk?
Well, it's not necessary.
Fine, I'll talk.
I don't appreciate being given junk jewelry and then lied to about it.
Oh, now, wait a second, that is not junk jewelry, Diane.
Oh, Sam, please, no more lies.
How could you pledge your troth with a paste ring?
Oh, that is not a paste ring!
All right, all right, there was there was another ring.
I but I switched it for the one in the window.
I swear to God I did, Diane!
Oh, please, don't bother swearing.
You have no idea what this day has I know this obviously means nothing to you.
I'd rather go without than wear a lie.
No, no, no!
Explain that part about switching rings again.
Oh, there's something shiny!
No.
Just another paper wrapper.
Oh, look at us.
We're filthy.
Yeah.
By the way, I hate that dress.
Considering the circumstances under which it was obtained, it's hardly one of my favorites anymore.
Okay.
Then I can count on you not wearing it when you visit me in the poorhouse that you put me in.
Oh, Sam, get off it.
No, no, no, wait a second.
Le-Let's tally up the damages here.
The first ring was $1,200.
The box was $290.
Four lovely pink frocks was a mere $950.
The, uh, damages on the car will be at least a grand.
And let's not forget about the $5,200 bite I was hoping to avoid in the first place.
Bringing it to a grand total of $9,000 for a ring I no longer have.
Well, I hasten to add that this was all of your own volition.
Ah $290 for the box?
Yeah.
Do you like do you like corn on the cob?
Well, I guess I'm just stupid to think that I could make someone like you happy on a budget of someone like me.
I'm sorry.
Well, you should be.
All right, I said I was!
Give me a bit of slack.
Even had that been the bargain ring, it would've been sinfully impetuous of me to cast it away.
Well, here's the bargain ring right now.
Why don't you give it the old heave-ho, too?
Hmm Hmm.
I'm somehow reminded of a fable penned by an anonymous 18th century author concerning the young mistress of a great feudal estate and a woodchopper who worked on the estate Diane not now, please?
Could I just tell you the moral?
What?
You're really neat.
Hardly a rich soul, I know.
The fact remains that no matter what the cost a ring is, above all else, a symbol of the feelings that two people have for each other.
So, truly, Sam, this is the ring I want.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, here.
Let me do this.
Uh But nothing says we can't keep looking.
: No!
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
Are you, uh, are you going to make a move in our lifetime?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Oh, come on, Norm.
Why don't you just give up?
You're finished.
Well, not necessarily.
He could move this piece over to here.
My God, Woody, that's brilliant.
You're suggesting that after two futile interpositions, he attempt to force unobstructed access to the eighth rank.
Well, no, I'm saying he should take your horsey with his little pointy-headed guy.
No, not that one.
Too late!
Checkmate!
Good game, Norm.
Okay, next victim.
Well, what's with this obsession with chess here, huh?
Oh, it's just a hobby, Sam.
You know, uh, relieve the tension.
Well, I got a better way to relieve tension.
Her name's Tawny.
You want her number?
No, thanks, Sam.
I prefer something with a little mental stimulation as well.
So read to her first.
No, thanks.
I'll stick to chess.
You know, that and fencing were my two outlets during college.
Oh, boy, fencing.
I haven't had the old epÃ©e out in years.
Boy, that'd make me pretty tense, too.
Making your way in the world today Takes everything you've got Taking a break from all your worries Sure would help a lot Wouldn't you like to get away Ã¢â¢Âª Sometimes you want to go Ã¢â¢Âª Ã¢â¢Âª Where everybody knows your name Ã¢â¢Âª And they're always glad you came You want to be where you can see Our troubles are all the same You want to be where everybody knows your name You want to go where people know People are all the same You want to go where everybody knows your name.
Mind if I play, Dr. Crane?
No, not at all, Woody.
I've thrashed everybody else in the bar.
You may as well be allowed your chance at ignominious defeat.
Well, thank you, Dr. Crane.
Hi, Sam.
Hi, Lor are you all right, Loretta?
I'm fine, and you?
Oh, I'm-I'm fine.
That's nice to hear.
Is Carla working tonight?
Yeah.
She's right over there.
Thank you, Sam.
It's been nice talking with you.
Excuse me, Carla, but I caught Nick cheating on me and I've decided to leave him.
So you finally found out my ex-husband is a jerk.
Well, I told you that before you married the bum.
I've done my part.
Carla Don't ignore her in her time of need.
Can't you tell when a woman is dying?
Sure.
When the roots start showing.
Like that.
Want a drink?
A diet cola would be wonderful.
Okay.
Look, kid, I'm sorry this happened to you.
Oh, thank you, Carla, thank you.
I'm moved beyond recognition.
How long did it take you to mend your broken heart?
I'll let you know when it happens.
Loretta would you like to talk about it?
Not really.
To come home and find out that a loved one has been unfaithful is a terrible blow.
The best therapy is to tell how you feel about it.
I'm against it.
All right, Diane, you've got your catharsis.
Now leave the girl alone.
Well, at least I'm trying to help.
You're merely trying to figure out why your king's about to be mated.
Oh, my God.
Woody, you must be an idiot savant.
Yeah, but I cover it by smiling a lot.
Come on, Loretta.
Don't hold it inside.
Well, Nick, who is my husband, has been seeing another woman.
I just realized it today when I found blonde hairs on Nick's shirt.
Loretta, you're a blonde.
Sure.
Take his side.
Would you excuse us, please?
Look, it's closing time.
Loretta needs someone to confide in right now.
Sam, why don't you go on home, and we ladies will take care of her.
Wh-What is this "we" bit?
I feel very strongly that it's our duty as women to be there for another woman when she wants to talk.
Just as I feel very strongly that it's my duty as a man to be there for a woman when she doesn't want to talk.
Same kind of thing.
We'll miss that kind of poignancy, Sam.
Now, what do you say?
Will you do it?
Oh, all right.
But only because no living thing should be subjected to a night alone with you.
That's the spirit.
Let's wrap it up, guys.
Oh, oh, well, all right, Sam.
We can, uh, finish this up tomorrow, Woody.
Well, who's winning now, Dr. Crane?
Oh, what does it matter who's winning?
We'll just start out fresh tomorrow, okay?
Night, Sam.
Oh, Carla, I still love him.
Nothing you can do.
We're talking about Nick Tortelli.
He wants you, you got no choice.
This is the part I don't get.
Here's a man that quicksand would spit up and yet he has this strange Svengali-like power over you.
Oh, yes.
From the moment I first saw him, I knew I'd follow him to the ends of the earth.
Where he's obviously spent a lot of time.
You know, there's, there's something about him.
I mean, he knows women.
Like a jeweler knows jewels.
Like a meat cutter knows meat.
Like a marine biologist knows marines.
Knowing me as well as I do, I'll probably end up crawling right back to him.
Yeah, and he'll be there waiting with that cute look on his face and those three little words, "She's my cousin".
You're not crawling back to him.
We're gonna fight this together.
You don't need that reptile.
You can take care of yourself.
But what'll I do?
Well, you must be good at something.
Well I'm great at singing.
Okay.
In fact, before I married Nick, I was on my way to becoming a taller, blonder, less Mormon Marie Osmond.
Loretta, if Nick's going to treat you this way, you can't let him come between you and your career.
You're right.
I've got to sing again.
Do you think Sam would let me sing here?
Let me take care of it.
I can talk him into anything.
No, Diane, I told you.
Absolutely not.
I wish you'd reconsider.
Oh, please Loretta needs a job.
And you've never had a singer before.
Oh, I've had a singer.
You probably mean Yes, in the bar.
Right.
It might be good for business.
I, uh I don't need a-a singer.
C-Can you waitress?
No, but I can do a salute to waitresses in my act.
Come on, it's only temporary, until she can get back on her feet.
Okay, all right.
Okay.
I ran across an interesting fact the other day.
You know, if I took a, uh, ride in a spaceship at the speed of light for ten years, when I return, I'd be ten years older, but everybody else here would be 80 years older.
Now, do you realize the ramifications of that?
Yeah, for once you'd be the best player on our softball team.
I just can't discuss science with you.
Cliffie, Cliffie Give me a break.
W-Wait!
Carla!
Nick.
Long time, no see.
You do somethin' to your hair?
No.
Think about it.
Nick, be a cannibal.
Eat a rat.
The magic is still there, Carla.
Whatever happened between us?
You lied, you cheated, you neglected the kids, you never came home, and you drank too much.
Nah.
It'd have to be more than that.
Say the word, blondie, and we can happen.
I'd rather be the love toy of a Greek army battalion.
Who wouldn't?
But dreaming gets you nowhere.
Nicky!
Loretta.
I've decided to forgive you for bursting in on me and Miss Romero in the shower.
I'm sorry, Nicky.
You oughta be.
It was very embarrassing.
Let's go home.
Okay.
Be strong.
I mean No.
That sounded negative to me.
I'm here for you.
I'm not going home with you.
I'm leaving you, Nick.
Uh get-g-get in the car, sugar lump.
Don't make me mad now.
Hey, Nick, why don't you leave her alone?
Uh, Sam, she's coming home with me.
Uh, in case you have forgotten, she is my, uh, betrothed.
She doesn't want to go back to him.
All right.
Please help her.
I know.
I know.
Nick, come on.
Beat it.
She doesn't want to be around you right now.
Eh, Sam, buddy, uh, it is not a good thing for them to see us fighting here.
Uh, these people, uh, they look up to us.
Uh, we're role models.
Then don't make me ask again.
Okay, okay, I'm not looking for trouble.
Eh, but mark my words.
Eh, I'm coming back for my woman.
Oh, Sam, you stood up for me.
Nobody's ever done that for me before.
Oh.
Sam, I'm aghast.
What?
You of all people?
!
Have you no respect for our blessed union?
Oh, come on, Nick.
There's nothing going on here.
I'm not interested in Loretta.
Uh, I got one thing to say to you, Sam.
Two can play the same game.
You took my woman I'm gonna take yours.
Me?
You're taking me?
The only thing you should be taking is penicillin.
This is great.
Nick is gonna cast a love spell on Miss Goody Two Shoes, and I get to watch.
Actually, I'm not gonna make my romantic approach tonight.
It's getting too late for that.
Ah, yes, goodness look at the time.
Time.
Time to lay back.
Time to forget your inhibitions.
This is diabolical.
From this day forward, there will be nobody for you but me.
You will fall hopelessly in love and follow me to the ends of the earth.
Oh, yeah and bring a six-pack.
God, the man is insane to think that anyone would be gullible enough to fall for that idiotic nonsense.
?
Mr. Sandman, bring me a dream.
?
Thank you, thank you.
You've been a wonderful audience.
Expecting someone, Diane?
No, not really.
Sure you are.
He's out there somewhere.
Waiting.
I've heard so much about Nick Tortelli's magic, but it's been a week, and I haven't seen any evidence of it.
Don't you see what he's doing?
It's all part of his plan.
You know, like when the drums stop in a jungle movie?
You sit and wonder what are the natives doing?
And then you start to sweat.
He's a genius.
Woody, I refuse to continue playing if every time you take one of my pieces, you go  I'm sorry, Dr. Crane; I thought it added a little bit of excitement to the game.
Well, it doesn't!
Okay, Woody.
You know, I think it's time we took off the gloves.
I have allowed you to defeat me several times because I was going easy on you, so as not to crush your natural enthusiasm.
But I think it's time you took a giant step toward maturity.
There are a great many lessons to be learned in defeat.
Chief among them is how to lose gracefully.
Checkmate.
You missed my king.
Dr. Crane!
Good night, Loretta.
Thanks, Sam.
Mm-hmm.
Never again does she sing in this bar.
Yes, dear.
You know, Sammy, I know you kind of like Diane.
But you're gonna have to face it.
She's his now.
Oh, come on, will you stop it?
I mean, Nick and Diane-- they don't even belong on the same planet.
The guy doesn't have any table manners.
I mean, he thinks he's God's gift to women.
And when was the last time he even picked up a book?
How's that different from you, Sam?
All right, there's a big difference there's a big difference between thinking you're God's gift and knowing it.
You know, Sammy, I, uh, think Nick is getting to you.
Why?
You think I'm worried about this?
Are you kidding?
Uh-huh, well, look at this.
You added these receipts all wrong.
I did not.
Then you're saying we took in $32 million tonight?
Well, there was that party of ten in the corner table there.
Yeah.
I'm gonna go add these on the machine, okay?
Yeah, maybe you better.
Uh Diane, I'm going to go home now and watch the, uh, last half of the Celtics game.
All right?
Okay, Sam.
See you in the morning.
Okay.
I'll be dreaming of you.
I'll be dreaming of me, too.
Closing!
Good evening, Miss Chambers.
Nick, you had better be here to tell me that you've given up your quest to win my favor.
Please, Miss Chambers, this is for you and you alone, my sweet.
God, you've got to be kidding!
In matters of amore, Nick Tortelli never kids.
Sit.
I am not a dog.
Of course you're not.
You think I'd spend this kinda dough on an ug-o?
Now, come on.
We have a night of magic ahead of us.
Let us commence.
Nick, there will be no dinner, no magic, no us.
You and I have to talk.
Now, please, sit down.
Okay.
Nick will you give up on me?
You and I are an impossibility.
The only thing you instill in me is the desire to flee.
And then to be de-flea'd.
I'm sensing that, uh, we're not gonna hit the sheets together.
That is correct.
Save it!
Why are you wasting your time on this?
Loretta's the woman for you.
She's spending all of her time with Sam.
Women can't get their eyes off of that guy.
I guess, in his own way, he's good-looking.
Oh, Nick, you're every bit as mistaken as you can be.
Sam and Loretta are not an item.
Sam is mine.
So, why don't you do something decent for once and go back and make your marriage work?
: Get up, get up, get up!
What's going on here?
Surprise!
I just came because I forgot my my charts.
Is this all for me?
Of course it's for you.
It's my attempt to win you back into my heart.
Isn't that right, Miss Chambers?
Oh, yes, yes.
He's really a sweet guy, isn't he, Loretta?
He sure is.
Yeah.
If he weren't already taken, I'd snap him up for myself.
Well, I'll leave you two lovebirds alone.
I'm just going in the back to freshen up.
I'll be out of here in just a few minutes.
I really like that Debbie.
Uh Loretta, if I have caused you, uh, any heartache, I want to say I'm sorry.
But I really do love you, and I know you love me, and it's crazy for us not to be together.
You're the only woman on Earth for me.
How come the cake says "Nick and Diane"?
Excuse me?
How come the cake says "Nick and Diane"?
You know what a lousy speller I am.
Oh, right.
But, wait, that's pretty bad.
This wasn't for me after all, was it?
This was for some girl named Diane!
No!
It's no use.
We're through forever.
If you ever need a singer, I'm available for any gig.
Cut it!
Nick.
Carla!
What's all this?
This is for you, my sweet.
All this is for me?
Yeah.
And if this is not an attempt at reconciliation, uh, I don't know what is.
This is.
You don't believe me?
Whose lipstick is on the glass?
What?
I'm gonna have the caterer flogged.
Right, Nick.
I hope you guys got your money up front.
Nick?
Diane.
Diane, look how fate once again has brought us together this evening.
Uh, excuse me if I don't get up for you.
Where's Loretta?
Uh, I don't know.
She, uh, she got up and ran out on me.
Uh, apparently, she didn't like the cake.
Nick, do yourself a favor.
Get up out of that chair, march out that door Do you mind?
March out that door, find your wife, take her in your arms, sweep her up off her feet, and tell her that "if our hearts cannot be as one for all eternity, life will have lost all meaning".
Okay, I'll do that.
That's it, boys.
You're off the clock.
Find your own ways home.
Loretta!
Did I miss something here?
Men.
They are so stupid.
What are you doing here?
Oh, well, I thought it was more important for me to be here with you than watching some silly old basketball game.
Your TV's broken?
Yeah.
This whole thing is so sad, really very sad.
Oh, that's all right.
It's under warranty.
It'll be okay.
No, I'm talking about life.
Oh, oh, oh, yeah.
How a good woman can make all the difference in the world, and yet men are constantly letting them slip away.
Mm I hope you don't let that happen to you and a certain flaxen-haired beauty in your life.
Don't worry.
I won't.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
Okay, guys, that's it.
Closing time.
Already?
It's hard to believe Well, good night, Sammy.
Good night.
Guys, don't forget, tonight's the night we go off daylight savings time.
Be sure to change your clocks.
Let's see now, it's 2:00 now, so which way does it go?
That's "spring forward, fall back," Mr. Peterson.
All right, so it's, uh, 1:00.
Set 'em up, Sammy.
I was this close to going home.
I love this universe.
Making your way in the world today Takes everything you've got Taking a break from all your worries Sure would help a lot Wouldn't you like to get away Sometimes you want to go Where everybody knows your name And they're always glad you came You want to be where you can see Our troubles are all the same You want to be where everybody knows your name You want to go where people know People are all the same You want to go where everybody knows your name.
Afternoon, Sam.
Everyone.
Hey, Frasier.
What's wrong?
You look like you lost your best friend.
Well, in a manner of speaking, I have.
A colleague of sorts passed away today.
Someone who contributed volumes to the world of psychology.
Well, I'm sorry.
Is it anybody I know?
Bombo the chimpanzee.
Oh.
Don't you remember, Sam?
They shared an office.
See, Bombo was one of Dr. Harry Harlow's apes.
Dr. Harlow was a behavioral theorist who worked extensively with primates studying human parenting and child rearing.
Bombo was the last of the group.
And he was the baby.
I can still see him clutching his little cloth surrogate mother.
I don't think we'll ever see his like again.
Can I get you anything?
Please.
Something to take my mind off my troubles.
How about a banana daiquiri?
Cute.
Yeah.
Good afternoon, everyone.
Hello.
Oh, hello, my darling.
Oh, my, will you look at that ring.
My boyfriend gave it to me.
You'll have to pardon my giddiness.
I am in such a glorious mood today.
I don't think anything could spoil it.
Bombo is dead.
Nope.
Not even that.
I have been selected to serve the Commonwealth of Massachusetts on jury duty.
I'm so sorry.
That's awful.
They tried to get me once, but I got off 'cause I got a good excuse.
I'm the sole support of six kids.
I suppose they felt that anyone who hadn't mastered birth control isn't smart enough for jury duty.
You know, I tried to serve, but they disqualified me.
Yeah?
Yeah.
I can't understand it, 'cause they went for my theory.
What theory's that?
The one about, uh, bringing back the guillotine.
Gee, they, uh, turned you down, huh?
I guess the old inmates are running the asylum, huh?
Well, I'm honored to have been chosen to participate in our system of jurisprudence.
I'll be proud to serve on a jury of my peers.
Or so they'll think.
You know, other than voting, I think jury duty is the single greatest privilege America bestows on her citizenry.
Couldn't get out of it, huh?
I tried everything.
Hey, you know who that is?
Yeah.
Oh, yeah, it's Eddie LeBec.
Eddie LeBec right here.
All right.
Wow, Eddie LeBec.
Who is Eddie LeBec?
Well, if they're excited about seeing him, he's either a sports figure or he holds the world's record for stuffing beer nuts up his nose.
Uh-uh-uh, that is Jimmy "The Snorkel" Stevens, Diane.
Yeah, he's a, uh, new goalie for the Bruins.
Hey, that old guy is hardly new.
He's been around the league for a while.
Yeah, but since the Bruins picked him up, he's won five in a row.
Boy, the injustice of it.
A man rises to such popular acclaim simply by stopping a hockey puck with his face while a courageous little chimp who advanced man's scientific knowledge dies almost anonymously.
You should have gotten the monkey a pair of skates.
You know, I've always had this thing for the goalies and catchers.
Guys who wear masks.
Some girls like the scorers, you know, the glamour guys?
Me, I like the grunts who crouch down and take everything that's thrown at them-- scarred faces, teeth missing, noses mashed to a meaty pulp.
God, they're sexy.
He's looking pretty thirsty over there, Carla.
Why don't you, uh?
Ooh, let me at him.
Hi, there.
Uh, could I have a glass of club soda, no ice, two slices of lime and a red straw, please?
Club soda, no ice, two slices of lime, and a red straw, please.
Sam, a club, club soda Yep, I heard, I heard, I heard.
Yeah, that was masterful, Carla.
Hey, you know what, you know what line I think really won his heart?
Wow, Eddie LeBec.
It sure is exciting seeing a sports figure in real life.
What about, what about me, Woody?
Well, I can't speak for you, Sam.
I only know I'm excited.
Oh, thank you.
Uh, Eddie, uh sorry I'm a little tongue-tied.
I I guess it's because I'm really a big fan of yours.
Oh, really?
Yeah.
You know who I am?
Are you kidding?
Eddie LeBec, born Hull, Quebec.
Drafted out of the juniors in the fifth round to the Toronto Maple Leafs.
Played for a year with the Leafs, then traded to the Winnipeg Jets, then to Calgary, then to Boston.
Wow.
Two game misconducts, 78 and 81.
Currently leads the league in goals against.
Mm-hmm.
Unmarried.
Favorite number is 5-5-5-7-8-4-3.
What's that?
Where I can be reached at night.
Oh.
Well, heh, it's really nice meeting you.
Carla.
Oh.
Carla Tortelli.
Hey.
Could I get you some pretzels?
Oh, no, I just drink, uh, one club soda, no ice, two slices of lime and a, and a red straw before every game.
Oh, superstitious, huh?
Oh, uh, no.
Just things have been going so well for me here in Boston, I, uh, don't want to do anything that might change that, you know?
Oh, right.
Well, uh, what other little rituals do you have?
Oh, I don't know.
Uh, I brush my teeth every day.
No kidding.
I, um I don't know.
I lace my left skate first, then my right skate.
Left and right, yeah.
And, um, since my winning streak started, I, I wear my underwear inside out.
You are really a fascinating guy.
Oh, gosh, Carla, you know, I, I got to go.
Uh Yeah.
It was really nice meeting you.
Yeah, you, too.
Yeah, thank you.
Say, Carla, would you like my tickets for tonight's game?
Whoa!
Yeah, well, you can just pick them up at Will Call.
Oh, thanks!
It was really nice meeting you.
You too, Eddie.
Okay.
Bye.
Bye.
See you.
Guys!
Guys, guys, get this!
I've got Eddie's tickets to the Garden tonight!
No way!
Bruins and Canadiens.
Seats so choice you can smell the sweat.
Oh, yeah.
Anybody want the other ticket?
Oh, God, I'd love to go, but I can't.
I got to work.
Oh, too bad, Sam.
Wait a minute.
Don't you have to work, too?
You don't think you can keep me here, do you?
Come on, what happened to "Sam, could I please have the night off"?
Sam, may I please have the night off?
Yes.
See how easy it is if you just ask?
So, who's it going to be?
Well, I only have one.
Cliff, Cliff, wait a second now.
I mean, our friendship's a little too important to be ripped apart by something as stupid as a hockey ticket, all right?
Well, I guess you're right, Normie.
A sporting event's only for a few hours.
Friendship like ours lasts forever.
Right.
There you go.
So, who's going to take it?
None of you, you, you.
Get out of here!
Isn't there anybody else?
What about Frasier?
Hey, Frasier, you look like you could use a pick-me-up.
A hockey game?
Yeah.
No, thank you.
I've been to the bullfights in Spain.
I've been to the altar with Diane.
I think that's enough carnage for one life.
Oh, come on, Frasier, go.
Bombo would have wanted you to.
Perhaps you're right.
You know, I've always wondered what makes the average person turn into an animal at a sporting event.
Perhaps I could witness the phenomenon and write a paper on it.
Put Dr. Frasier Crane back on the map.
Carla, thank you.
I accept.
Well, at least I won't be fondled all night.
Man, what a game!
Eddie stopped 40 shots!
Oh!
I mean, I haven't seen a guy have a night like that since Harmon Killebrew hit those three moon-shot homers off of you, Sam.
Yes, I was certainly lucky to be there to see that, wasn't I?
Then at the end of the game when the crowd was giving Eddie his standing "O," he skated right past me and spit.
Well, you're very lucky, Carla.
Most men would have been embarrassed to make such a show of affection in public.
You know, I got to believe you're right.
Yeah, Carla, where's Frasier?
I don't know.
The last I saw of him, they were hauling him off in a security van.
Well, just curious.
"Security van"?
What happened?
I don't know.
I was watching the game.
I guess there was some kind of scuffle.
He got caught up in it.
Good Lord!
Oh, hey, Carla, look who came back, eh?
I'm sure he's not here just to see me.
Yeah?
Carla, the man spit.
Hey, great game, Eddie.
Thanks, Carla.
Want a beer?
Yeah, sure.
Beer, Sam.
So, uh what're you doing back here?
Well, I'm kind of new in Boston.
I really don't know anybody.
That'll be all.
Well, how about the other guys on the team?
I don't know.
Most of the other guys are, I don't know, married or they have girlfriends, so I just thought I'd come back and see you know, how you liked your seats.
Loved 'em!
I like your seat, too.
Carla, you coquette.
Say, uh, Carla, you, can you come around and sit down and, uh, maybe we can talk a little bit.
Sure!
Oh, thanks.
So, you're a hockey fan, eh?
Oh, yeah.
Well what else should I know about you?
Me?
Well, uh, I'm in my mid-20s, never been married, got no kids.
You're next in line to the throne of England.
Dr. Frasier Crane, noted psychiatrist, winner of the Mildred Bergen Fellowship, author of 27 published articles, is out on bail.
Frasier, what happened?
Well, you know, I've always prided myself on being a man of control and maturity.
But suddenly I was swept up into this crowd's excitement.
Well, damn me to a junior college for saying it, I was enjoying myself.
But I guess the controlled mayhem of the situation made me more assertive.
Also, there was this guy sitting in front of me who insisted on wearing his cowboy hat.
Well, I asked this huckleberry several times to remove it, and he refused, and so then I just took it off his head and handed it to him, and he handed it back to me with his fist in it.
Next thing I know, I'm in a holding cell at some North End station house with the cast of The Road Warrior.
Did you get Mel Gibson's autograph?
So, uh, so you had a little fight.
You stood up for yourself.
Come on, look me in the eye face-to-face here.
Didn't it feel great?
Well, I have to admit,  There was a moment there when I had a feeling of satisfaction like never before in my life.
Sorry, Diane.
Oh So, Carla, I'd better get back to my place.
I gotta look at some films.
I just, uh, I don't know, I just wanted to stop in and see, you know, just Hey, Eddie, you know, I really should be honest with you.
I do have kids.
Two.
Well, I love kids.
Six.
I'd still like to see ya again, okay?
Oh, anytime.
Okay.
No, no, no, no.
If these guys, you know, find out that you kissed me, that's all I'd be hearing about for the next month.
All right.
Come on.
He kissed me!
Well, Sam, that was my lawyer.
He's managed to get the authorities to drop all the charges.
All right.
Okay.
Got off scot-free, huh?
Not exactly.
It seems I have to undergo seven hours of psychological counseling.
Man, it is busy back there, Sam.
So, uh, Carla, you're seeing old #33 again tonight, huh?
No, Cliff, Eddie's got a game tonight.
Yeah, after a couple of nights with you, he's looking for something a little less strenuous to do, eh?
Listen, you couch potatoes, don't get the wrong idea.
There's nothing serious between us.
We're just friends.
Well, you say that, Carla, but why am I picking up the subtle fragrance of la belle amour?
You know, I like Eddie well enough.
And what can I say?
It's kind of a kick dating a star.
I mean, I've never been out before with a guy who has a driver come and pick him up and take him anywhere he wants to go.
Ooh, he's got a limousine?
No, he has me.
But he pays for everything.
You know, movies, parking, refreshments.
Do you know how much a tub of popcorn is going for these days?
It's, uh, $3.70 at the Alto.
Yeah, that Eddie takes care of me real good.
But you're not falling for him, right?
Oh, look, who are we fooling here, Sam?
I mean, you know my luck with men.
You can't swing a dead cat without hitting some bum who once dumped on me.
And Eddie LeBec is a star.
You know, once he's been here a while, he'll know a lot more people, and it's "Bye-bye, Carla".
Hey.
No way some guy like that ends up with me.
Listen, will you stop cutting yourself short?
You offer a lot of things to a guy.
Oh, yeah, sure.
Six kids, mortgage up to my ears, stack of bills, dead-end job and fallen arches.
You know, if I weren't already engaged Hi, Sam.
Hello.
Sorry I'm late.
The first day of the trial went a little longer than I expected.
Oh, that's all right.
Just grab an apron.
We got the Bruins playing tonight.
And the Eddie LeBec Fan Club is holding forth, led by President Carla Tortelli.
Right.
Luck of the draw.
I think I have gotten the most challenging and interesting case of the year.
Oh, that's great.
Listen, do me a favor, will ya?
Go upstairs and get me some change, please?
Fine.
Of course, I can't discuss the details of the trial, but, oh, only if I could.
Quarters.
Mostly quarters, yeah.
I can tell you that I've been chosen foreman of the jury.
Well, that's great.
Yeah, listen, you do good with this change thing, and I'll make you captain of the bar.
Well just as well that I'm leaving.
I wouldn't want to slip and divulge too much information.
Particularly in this case.
Attempted murder.
This is the last place I'd talk about it.
Once I let something out, you'd all be prodding me endlessly for details.
Sammy, is Diane coming in today?
: Yeah.
Hey, folks.
Hey, Sam.
Hey.
Hey, Carla.
Eddie.
How you doing?
Woody, get that man a club soda, no ice, two slices of lime, and a red straw.
Is that really what you want?
Yes, sir.
How'd you know that, Sam?
He ordered it yesterday.
Oh, well, then I'd better hurry.
You know, I used to, uh I used to have this little ritual when I was pitching for the Red Sox.
Mm-hmm.
Before every game, I'd go out to our third base coach, Ernie Pantusso, and he'd rub my tummy and I'd rub his head.
Next thing we knew, the whole stadium was looking at two grown men standing in the middle of the field rubbing each other.
After that we, we did it in the locker room.
Pretty soon after that, we just stopped altogether.
Anyway, all I know is that I've never played better than, than this in my life.
Yeah?
The puck's looking as big as a frisbee.
My reactions are quicker than ever.
I've never been happier.
I'm not gonna do anything to break my routine.
Except to add one thing.
Whoa.
I'm dedicating tonight's game to you.
Good night, Eddie.
Good night.
Hey, Eddie.
Your wallet fell out of your coat.
Oh.
Stop kidding around.
Okay, I'll see ya.
He's always kidding around.
SPORTS  is on the attack.
They bring it out on center ice now on the red line.
The puck is tipped away, Flyers.
The Bruins get it back again, and Of course, I can't really talk about the trial.
No, no, I had the vodka gimlet.
Oh, right, I'm sorry.
I could, I suppose, give you a hypothetical case, just to give you an idea.
Not that it would be the same, but similar.
Now, we have a defendant who's accused of attempted murder of his wife.
We'll call him Scum.
And a wife.
Let's call her Victim.
I really shouldn't be telling you this.
It's just that I can't help it.
I'm compelled to share it with someone.
But no, no, I'm not going to say another word.
I'm going to zip my mouth.
Can I get you anything else?
No, zipping your mouth will be fine.
Hey, how much time we got left?
Minute and a half.
Oh, come on, Eddie.
Come on.
You got it.
He's got to be the greatest.
I mean, three periods and overtime, and the Flyers have only put one in against him.
Sure.
Man, can he ever hold them.
Oh, you think he can hold 'em?
I've had four beers this period alone.
I have not left this barstool.
All right?
Give me an A. A!
Give me a B!
B!
Give me a C!
C!
Give me a D!
D!
Wait, wait a minute, Woody.
What're you doing?
The alphabet.
We're warming up here.
Give me a What exactly is the definition of attempted murder?
Does does the accused actually have to go through with the crime and fail?
Or is it our duty to look into his craven heart and determine his intent?
I mean, how often does someone just happen to lose control of a power saw?
Come on, Eddie!
I'm here!
I'm with you!
Uh, Carla, he picked a heck of a game to dedicate to you, huh?
You're telling me.
Sammy.
Sam, would you look at me?
I'm on top of the world.
I'm Eddie LeBec's chick.
I mean, I am dating the hottest goalie in the league, and everybody knows me.
For once in my life, I really feel like I'm somebody.
No, no, no, the Flyers stole it!
Now, don't worry, boys.
It's time for the old Tortelli lucky charm.
Eddie, for you.
Battle for the puck along the boards.
Time running out.
Doesn't look like they'll get a shot off.
Five seconds, four seconds.
Brock plays it on the boards and Fratti shoots.
He scores!
The winning goal for Philadelphia!
The game is over on a shot that LeBec should have blocked in his sleep.
Great.
Eddie blew it.
Just my luck.
You know, if it was me in that fairy tale, and I kissed the frog, he'd end up turning into a lizard.
One who couldn't go to his left.
Come on, come on, come on.
Lighten up on him.
He just had an off night, that's all.
I mean, that guy is gonna take us all the way to the Stanley Cup.
You're right.
I mean, what am I saying?
Yeah.
He'll bounce back tomorrow.
You bet.
He'll be fine.
Inside of a week, that Muyaak will be ice fishing in Nova Scotia.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
Hi, Sam, this is Carla.
I'll be in a little late today.
Eddie's really down about his losing streak, and I want to cheer him up.
It may take six or seven hours.
You know hockey players.
Bye.
Hi, Sam, it's me.
I'm on a little break from the trial.
We had some of the most fascinating testimony today.
Of course, I'm not at liberty to discuss it.
Suffice it to say  and the defendant had the unmitigated gall to get Oh, uh, they're calling us back in.
I have to go.
Love you.
Bye.
Uh, this is Woody.
Sam, uh, I got home tonight and remembered Diane called after you left and wanted me to give you a message.
I love you.
Bye.
Uh, Sam, this is Woody again.
That message I just left-- you understand it was Diane saying I love you, not me.
All right, bye.
This is Woody again.
Uh, don't misunderstand me, I really like you a lot.
This is Woody again.
Uh, I've been thinking it over, Sam.
I do love you.
Making your way in the world today Takes everything you've got Taking a break from all your worries Ã¢â¢Âª Sure would help a lot Ã¢â¢Âª Ã¢â¢Âª Wouldn't you like to get awayÃ¢â¢Âª Ã¢â¢Âª Sometimes you want to go Where everybody knows your name And they're always glad you came You want to be where you can see Our troubles are all the same You want to be where everybody knows your name You want to go where people know People are all the same You want to go where everybody knows your name.
Hey, uh, Normie?
Are you going to do my taxes again this year?
Sure thing, bud.
Yeah, boy, I'm going to need some help shuffling through these new tax laws, I'll tell you.
What new tax laws?
Maybe, uh, maybe I'll just short-form it this year.
See there's a little more Eddie LeBec trade talk here.
Oh, yeah?
Oh, terrific.
Uh, Bruins are playing Gretzky at Edmonton tonight.
Boy, another chance to see Eddie "Come on in and bring your puck" LeBec.
: Yeah.
Boy, I tell you, that zuke is a disgrace to his teammates and this fair city.
Come on, give him a break.
Well, Sammy, it's not like we're not for the guy.
I mean, especially with Carla going out with him.
But, you know, the guy's in a major slump, let's face it.
Hey, I can tell you an interesting thing about slumps, too.
Uh, statistics show that they can be grouped into four categories.
Yeah?
Yeah, that's right.
Uh, 65 percent physical, yeah, 15 percent psychological and, uh, three percent dental.
Cliffie, you know something, man?
You're a walking encyclopedia.
Oh, thank you, Normie.
Unfortunately, you're also a talking encyclopedia.
Motions, recess, motions, recess.
When is this thing going to end?
Two weeks, and the wife hasn't even taken the stand yet.
Sorry.
I missed a couple words of testimony.
I wanted to go back and double-check it with the court reporter.
Why do you keep your own record of the testimony?
They write down everything that's said.
They don't write down emotions attitudes, telling facial glances.
Study my face.
What am I thinking?
As the foreman of your jury, I feel that it is my duty to record each shred of evidence to give us every kernel of information so that we can make the thoughtful and correct decision.
Well, I've already made my decision.
I think he's innocent.
Yes.
Me, too.
Well, why don't we just tell the judge that and go home?
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
How can you possibly think that?
I believed his testimony.
Seems like a good guy.
And he was impeccably dressed.
I can't believe that I'm hearing this.
These are your grounds for acquittal?
Well, pardon me my objectivity, but I don't happen to agree.
He did it!
I'm sure of it.
I can tell just by looking at him.
Oh, yeah?
Yes.
I was in a very similar situation to the wife in that my fiancÃ© has the same disarming brand of charm.
Are you saying that you're about to marry a murderer?
No, don't stop her.
Let her do it.
Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha!
Laugh if you will.
I'm not fooled by Mr. Grand, and neither should you be.
Ladies and gentlemen, the judge would like you back in the courtroom.
What's going on?
Well, just between us, Mrs. Grand is dropping the charges.
Dropping charges?
Why?
She realized she still loves her husband.
Excuse me.
Would it be possible for me to talk with Mrs. Grand?
Are you serious?
It's over.
Oh, I am so happy for him.
I'm happy for us.
No more jury duty.
Oh, where are you guys going afterward?
I tell you, the guy's a bum!
Sammy, two, uh, drafts and a Manhattan.
And who's a bum?
Eddie.
Fisher.
Eddie Fisher.
The guy hasn't had a hit record in years.
Well, you better be talking about him and not my Eddie.
Are you worried about the game tonight?
Of course I'm worried about it.
I know Eddie's had a couple of bad games.
Seven.
Nine.
Seven.
I've never been very good with numbers.
Yeah, well, I got a really good feeling about tonight's game, you know?
The weather's cleared, it's a full moon, and it's an even-numbered day in an even-numbered month.
He'll turn it around tonight, you'll see.
Oh, I think you're right.
Oh, yeah, absolutely, Carla.
There you go.
Absolutely.
Hey, uh, I don't know if you guys have the same feeling I do, but I think it is just more than a coincidence that Eddie LeBec's, uh, bad run started when he began dating Carla.
I say she's a jinx.
Oh, come on; hey, don't say that.
I mean, Carla's finally found someone she really likes.
But what else could it possibly be, Sam?
Aw, it's ridiculous.
I-I don't believe in that.
Yeah, hey, Frasier, come here.
Listen, tell these guys, will you, that there's nothing to the idea that Carla might be jinxing Eddie.
Well, Sam, technically, there is no such thing as a jinx, unless someone thinks there is.
Now, we know that Eddie's very superstitious.
If he believes that Carla's a jinx, I'm afraid it becomes a self - fulfilling prophecy.
All right, so Carla's a jinx.
What are we going to do about it?
Well, I don't know about the rest of you guys, but I am not going to let that woman kiss me.
Yeah, right.
Like there's a real danger of that happening.
Right.
Hello, everyone.
Oh, hello.
Well, Sam, you'll be happy to know that you have me back full-time now.
Oh.
The trial is over.
Well, good.
Who won?
Certainly not justice.
I'm afraid the wife decided to drop all charges.
But I say the husband is a con artist who somehow managed to convince that naive woman that he loves her.
How can a man tell a woman that he loves her and yet try to kill her?
I can see it.
I can see it.
Sammy, uh, could you, uh, step down to my office for one second, please?
Listen, uh, we were thinking maybe someone's got to tell Carla that she's jinxing Eddie.
And what suicidal idiot did you have in mind to do that?
You know, your name kept coming up in the discussion No, no, no, no, no Come on, Sammy.
Look, it's just for all us guys whose lives are so damn shallow that we depend upon the success of our local sports teams to give us a little identity around here.
Am I right?
Huh?
No, no, no, no way.
Listen, if you want to do this, then we'll do it fair and square.
We'll draw straws.
Don't look.
Oh, that's fair, Normie.
Now, I want the person who has to tell Carla to know that there's a choir job waiting for them in Vienna.
Sorry, Norm.
Well, on the upside, Normie, you're in for some great strudel.
Oh, damn.
I've never been to Europe.
Listen, uh Carla, uh a few of the guys and I have been thinking.
Now, this probably has, like, absolutely nothing to do with anything, but, uh You know, Norm, I've been thinking about Eddie and what's happened to his game and all that, and do you think it's possible that I could be jinxing him?
You?
Jinxing Eddie?
That's silly.
No way!
: No.
: Thank you, God.
Sam?
Yeah?
You don't think it's possible that I'm jinxing Eddie, do you?
No.
Me, either.
It's got to be something else.
And when he comes here, we're going to figure it out together.
You really like the guy, don't you?
I am this close to falling hard for him.
Oh, boy.
Hey, Eddie!
Oh  Hey, Eddie!
Hi.
How's it going?
Well, after my last game, a fan sent me some new equipment.
Dark glasses and a white cane.
Oh, you're just having a slump.
You'll get out of it.
I don't know, Sam.
I've tried everything.
I've been watching game films, taking extra practice.
I don't know what to do.
What did you used to do to break out of slumps when you were pitching, Sam?
Me?
Well, I, uh, drank myself into a coma.
Did it work?
Hey, Eddie.
Hey, hey, Carla.
Tonight's your night; I know it.
Yeah, well, facing Gretzky, eh?
Hey, forget him.
You carrying that lucky clove of garlic I gave you?
Yeah.
Yes, he is.
I don't know, Carla.
I'm starting to get that choking feeling I usually get a day or two before they send me down to the minors.
No, no, no, come on!
I don't want to hear any of that.
There's got to be an explanation for this, and we're going to figure it out right now.
Let's take it from the beginning, okay?
When was the last time you won?
Well, let's see.
I think that would be the Canadiens game, eh?
Um, that's right, because I remember that's the night we met.
Yeah could've been somewhere around then.
Yeah, so, um, when did things start going bad?
Well, I guess that would be the next game.
Right.
All right, now think really hard.
Have you been doing anything different during that time-- um, eating different foods, taking a different route to the Garden, buying different magazines?
I mean, anything, anything at all?
No, no, nothing at all.
I I've been living my life the same way as I've always lived it.
Except for one thing.
Eddie, do me a favor.
Yeah, Carla.
Beat it.
What's the problem?
The problem is we just don't work anymore.
It's been a lot of grins, but we both knew it wasn't going to last forever.
So, it's time for you to hit the pavement.
Well, hey, I I don't get it.
I thought things were going great for us.
Yeah, well, they were, but they're not anymore, and I just don't want to talk about it, so shove off!
Okay.
Whatever you say.
I'll see you around, I guess.
Pretty gutsy thing to do.
Gutsy?
Nothin'.
I'm going to prove to all you yutzes and to myself that I'm no jinx.
If Eddie loses tonight, it's not my fault.
You'll see.
He can stink just as bad without me as he stunk with me.
It's not Romeo and Juliet, but it has a certain charm.
TV  Time running out in the third period.
It's still one-nothing, favor of the Boston Bruins.
Here's Gretzky across the Boston line, taps in front.
Rolling save by Eddie LeBec!
He went sprawling to the front side and kicked it out with his right hand.
Sammy, two beers and a vodka rocks.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Come on, is my order up yet?
What?
Oh, c-come on, give me a second.
Whoa-ho-ho-ho!
There's people here, Sammy?
Are you running a bar or you just watching some stupid hockey game?
All right, all right, all right.
You want to know what the score is?
Is Boston leading?
Yeah.
Did the Oilers score on Eddie?
No.
I'm not interested.
Whoa, look out, whoa!
Penalty?
!
He calls that slashing?
Well, Frasier, he nearly cut Curry in half there.
Oh, ticky-tack.
It's a wussy call.
Let the guys play the game.
Good eve Aren't you Bill and Sherry Grand?
That's right.
: Oh What an incredible coincidence.
I was the foreman of the jury at your trial.
Oh, yeah, the one with the notebook.
Oh, you noticed?
It was hard not to.
I was keeping track of the testimony.
Diane Chambers.
Hello.
Well, it's a pleasure to meet you.
Why weren't you at the party?
Party?
What party?
The party the jury threw for me.
I'm surprised they would've had it without you.
You seem so attractive and intelligent.
Yes, well, those qualities confuse some people.
Besides, I had to work.
But who cares about me?
The important thing is you two are back together again, huh?
Thank you.
Could we maybe order?
I'd like a glass of white wine.
Wine.
What-what would you like?
I'll have a Bloody Mary.
Excuse me.
I know this is very forward of me, but the last time I saw you in court, you were ranting and raving, calling this man a wife murderer.
It's very shocking for me to see you with him now, so blissful.
I guess I just realized how much I love him.
I really admire your your trust, your conviction.
If you don't mind a little friendly advice, I'd sleep with one eye open.
I'll get the drinks.
It's a good thing you dropped the charges.
I'd hate to have my fate in her hands.
Bill why did you have the power saw in the kitchen?
Sam Hit 'em!
A white wine and a Bloody Mary.
Oh human nature.
What?
!
Oh that couple over there.
They're the Grands.
You remember.
The case on which I was foreman of the jury?
Oh, right, right, right, the, uh, power saw.
I know.
You don't trust me?
Oh, I tell you, it never ceases to amaze me how some people can be so ignorant of what is obvious to the rest of the world.
Well, I guess there's something to be said for forgiveness.
In fact, in this rather jaded day and age, it's nice to know that amor vincit omnia.
Hmm?
Love conquers all.
Mm.
And I, for one, shall not stand in its way.
You know, Sam, I'm going to pay for this round.
Well, you better hurry.
It looks like he's about to fire up the old Black & Decker there.
Oh, don't touch me!
Stay away from me!
Just stay away from me!
What happened?
What happened?
Why don't you check your stupid little notebook?
!
So the system works after all.
TV  Back the Oilers go, back behind the net.
Mark Muskee starting out for the center ice.
Oilers trailing, one-nothing.
They fool the goal tender.
Pressure really on Eddie LeBec right now.
Please screw up, please screw up, please screw up.
Sam, I don't understand.
Why does Carla want Eddie to screw up?
Well, you see, if Eddie loses, then Carla wins, because it proves she's no longer a jinx.
But if he wins, then Carla loses, 'cause it reinforces the jinx theory.
Ah, the old "boy loses, girl wins, boy wins, girl loses" jinx reinforcement theory.
If I've seen it once, I've seen it TV  Still one-nothing, Boston Bruins lead.
Time running out on the game.
Oilers bring it out to center ice.
Here's Mark Messier across the red line into the Bruins' zone.
Gives it down the left side to Glenn Anderson, cutting in in front-- he shoots!
And it's saved by Eddie LeBec!
Point-blank range.
Eddie LeBec with a great save, wins the game for the Boston Bruins.
Damn!
Hey, Sam.
Hey.
See the game tonight?
I sure did.
Congratulations.
Thanks.
Yeah.
It felt great.
Did you ever have one of those nights you just knew you could do no wrong?
Oh, yeah, all the time.
Well, twice.
There you go.
Thanks.
What are you doing here?
Just came by for a drink.
That okay?
Free country.
You know Carla, after the game tonight, I I figured out why you dumped me.
I guess I'm a little slow on the uptake since I've taken so many on the melon.
I, uh I guess you wanted to see if you were causin' my slump, eh?
Yeah, and guess what?
Well, it doesn't seem fair that the girl that means more to me than anybody else ever has, you know, turns out to be a turns out, you know Say it: a jinx.
A hex, a whammy, a voodoo, a curse.
What am I going to do?
You're not going to do anything.
I'm not going to be responsible for the Bruins missing the playoffs or for your career going down the toilet.
Hey, Eddie.
Yeah.
Knock 'em dead.
Yeah.
And watch out for those wrist shots low in the corner on your stick side.
Okay, you got it.
Oh.
I wanted you to have this.
What is it?
It's a recording of our song.
I thought you know, maybe sometime, you would I don't know, maybe play it and and, um, think of me you know, think good stuff.
I will.
Okay.
All right, I'll see you, Carla.
Yeah.
See you.
You, too, Sam.
Well For a refreshing change, Carla Tortelli ends up without the guy.
This shirt's drip-dry if you want to give it a No, no, come on.
It's happened so many times, my tear ducts are all dried up.
Why don't you go on home, Sam?
Come on.
I'll clean up here.
Is that what you want?
Yeah, yeah, I think I want to be alone for awhile.
Okay but if you want someone to talk to, I'll be over at Diane's.
So, you know, if you want to call, just go ahead.
Please call.
Thanks, Sam.
Good night.
MALE SINGER : ?

With glowing hearts, we see thee rise The True North strong and free Hey, Wood, what you working on?
Cheers newsletter.
Wood, Cheers doesn't have a newsletter.
Wow, there's a scoop.
I'll make that my lead story.
Ah.
Night, Wood.
G'night.
Say, Carla, you sure you don't want to go to the game with me tonight?
I'm really on a hot streak.
You're tellin' me you're on a hot streak.
For the past few weeks, you've been fantastic.
Not bad on the ice, either.
Hey, Eddie, do me a favor and beat it!
What's the problem?
Problem is we just don't work anymore.
It's been a lot of grins, but we both knew it wasn't going to last forever.
I don't get it.
I thought things were great between us.
Well, they were, but they're not anymore, so hit the bricks.
All right, whatever you say.
Say, I was in here a couple of weeks ago.
Didn't Carla and her boyfriend break up then?
Yeah.
They do that before every game.
It's kind of a ritual.
Hey, Carla, that's it!
We're finished!
Through!
Good-bye!
Good-bye!
Red Wings Thursday night.
See you then, eh?
Superstitious little guy, but he's mine.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Hey, Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
Hi, Wood.
Let me get a beer, will you?
Oh, say, what'd you do to your thumb there?
Oh, well, it's a long story, but, uh, I was playing this guy some pool last night, and I had this one- four-seven combination.
Yeah.
So, I was trying to show off and sink all of them in one shot, but the balls were positioned in such a way that I had to lean way over the edge of the table and get in a kind of twisted-up Yeah, so, what, you fell and you broke your thumb?
No.
I still couldn't get the shot, so I went and got the bridge and I got up on a chair and I put all my weight on the bridge.
And it snapped and you fell and broke your thumb?
No.
I made the shot and I beat the guy.
Oh, so he got angry and he broke your thumb, right?
No, I beat him fair and square and he paid me the ten bucks he owed me.
So, how did you break your thumb?
I slipped on the ice on the way home.
Woody, why did you go into all that long-winded detail about the game?
Well, now, it wouldn't have been much of a story without the pool stuff.
Hello, Woody.
What happened to your thumb?
Oh, I slipped on the ice.
Woody, why didn't you tell him the long, drawn-out version?
That's the guy I was playing pool with.
Making your way in the world today Takes everything you've got Taking a break from all your worries Ã¢â¢Âª Sure would help a lot Ã¢â¢Âª Ã¢â¢Âª Wouldn't you like to get awayÃ¢â¢Âª Ã¢â¢Âª Sometimes you want to go Where everybody knows your name And they're always glad you came You want to be where you can see Our troubles are all the same You want to be where everybody knows your name You want to go where people know People are all the same You want to go where everybody knows your name.
What the hell is keeping Diane?
I'm gonna be late for school.
School, Carla?
Well, I must say I'm delightfully astonished.
You know, I've always held that adult education is one of the finest gifts that one can give oneself.
Kudos on joining the ever-burgeoning ranks of enlightened, wondering minds seeking betterment through knowledge.
It's traffic school, you nimrod.
You got pinched, huh, Carla?
Yeah, speeding.
But it wasn't my fault.
There was a leaf stuck on my windshield, and I had to gun her up to 80 to blow it off.
What, and the cop didn't believe you?
No.
Couldn't be bribed, either.
Carla, what, you offered a policeman money?
Money?
With a body like this?
Huh.
Hello, everyone.
We're back.
Sammy, where you been, man?
Picking china patterns.
This may have been the stupidest morning of my life.
Oh, Sam, don't forget.
Tomorrow we register for flatware.
The second stupidest.
Well, did you select something nice?
We've committed to Royal Doulton's Carlisle for the fine china, but Sam still hasn't made up his mind about the everyday ware.
Yes, I have.
I, I like the dishes with the different colored flowers.
Oh, ish!
Come on, I love those.
They're just like I had when I was a kid.
They're real pretty, and-and if you don't like the food on your plate, you can hide it in the pattern.
Okay, fine.
Well, uh, why don't you think about it, and if you still insist that they're not the most garish, bourgeois, stomach-turningly ugly pattern in the book, then that's what we'll get.
She's making me nuts with this wedding stuff.
So, ditch her.
You know, if I had my way, I would find the nearest justice of the peace and, and tie the knot.
You know, that's not such a bad idea.
Right.
Or you could ditch her.
Don't you have traffic school, or something?
Nuts!
Now I'm gonna be late!
Well, I guess I can make it if I run all the yellows.
Sam Yo.
I've got Penelope from the bridal registry on the line, and we're going back over the linen choices.
Now, for the fingertip towels in the guest bath, do we want monogrammed, or is that too ootsie?
The second thing you said.
I agree.
Of course a simple initial can be elegant.
Oh, I think you'd better look at the picture.
I need a man's opinion.
Frasier, help Diane, will you please?
Sam, these will be our fingertip towels for the rest of our lives.
We'd better get married quick, or I'm gonna kill her.
All right, all right, that's it.
Bachelor party here tonight.
What are you talking about?
Well, didn't you hear the man?
Uh, they might be eloping.
And I'm not gonna be, uh, done out of my right as best man to, uh, throw him the best wingding of the century.
All right now, so what're we gonna have?
Just a second here, Cliff.
Uh, Sam asked you to be his best man?
Well, not in so many words, but, uh, you know, who's closest?
So, uh  Hold on now, I don't know.
I may not have known Sam as long as some of you guys, but we're pretty darned close.
I think I'm kind of like the brother he never had.
Wait, Woody, Sam has a brother.
Guess we're not as close as I thought.
Well, look, I think we better throw the greatest bachelor party for the greatest bachelor who ever lived.
Tell you what.
I'll pick up some deli platters and some champagne, and you guys can just reimburse me, you know, at your leisure, all right?
Why didn't you say so in the first place?
Okay, we got the food and the drink taken care of.
Now we need a little bit of entertainment.
Who's gonna?
Well, I-I think tradition calls for, uh, what about a stag film, huh?
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I think there's a place on my route that might sell them.
Uh, the, uh, Hot and Nasty Video Boutique.
Yeah, I think there might be one or two laying around there.
Okay, we got the food, drink, entertainment.
Now all we need is a, uh, a girl jumping out of the cake.
Oh, yeah, I've seen them do that in the movies all the time.
That seems like a waste of good cake to me.
You see, Woody, the cake is really immaterial.
It's the girl who's the actual dessert.
Right.
Well, then I think it should be Miss Chambers.
Ooh.
Aw, come on.
you know, no guy wants his fiancÃ©e jumping out of a cake.
It's, I mean, it's like taking your mother to the prom.
Or so I'm told.
Okay, okay, okay, so where can we get Sammy someone hot?
Dare we look in his book?
Nah, Sammy's had all those girls.
Oh, Sam, stop being such a grumble-bunny.
Just grit your teeth and pick out a dust ruffle.
Guys, I still say we're missing a bet right under our noses.
Look, pal, trust me Oh, it's that's okay.
Listen, I it wouldn't hurt to ask.
No, no, no, no, don't, don't Excuse me, Miss Chambers?
Yes, Woody?
Uh Uh, would you like to jump out of Sam's bachelor party cake?
Woody, I abhor such juvenile, sexist male rituals.
Yeah, but would you do it?
Just checking.
All right, guys, you're right.
We're going to have to find some other beautiful girl to be Sam's dessert.
Wait a minute.
I, I just realized why you want me, the bride-to-be, to jump from the cake.
It's a wonderful irony.
Oh Of course I'll do it.
Of course.
Oh, great.
Imagine me, of all people, missing the point of a joke.
Hey, don't worry about it, Miss Chambers.
It even happens to me.
Sammy, uh, what time you got there, man?
I'd better be getting home to, uh, Vera.
: Oh, yeah.
Yeah, you know what they say: "An early bird catches the obsessive-compulsive".
'Night, Sam.
Oh, boy!
They sure took off in a hurry, didn't they?
Yeah, but that doesn't seem suspicious to you, does it?
No, I I guess not.
Oh, hey, I have an idea.
You go in the back and total these receipts, and we'll get out of here.
Okay.
All right.
Say, Woody, when I come back out here, there's not going to be a surprise for me, is there?
A surprise party, maybe?
No.
You're not lying, are you?
Sam, you'd know if I was lying.
I'd I'd tell you.
Right.
I'll, uh, I'll be in my office.
All right.
Come on in, guys.
He doesn't suspect a thing.
Come on down, fellas.
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
Okay?
In the words of the immortal bard, "Party"!
Uh, Sam, you can go home now.
Surprise!
Wow!
Sam, you should have seen the look on your face!
Ooh!
Hey!
All right!
Boy!
Thanks, guys.
Yeah, man.
That last scene gave me new respect for rowing machines.
I hear you, bud.
Ooh!
Hey, you guys, oh!
Thank you.
This has been fantastic.
I have to admit that I used to think that bachelor parties were kind of embarrassing.
Get the lights!
Oh, God, not again  Girl in there, right?
Well Just your type.
So make the obligatory speech and have at her!
Yeah!
Oh, no, I can't do it.
I you know  No, I-I know you went to a lot of trouble.
I'm sorry, but it just wouldn't be right.
What?
Come on, Sammy.
What is this?
Malone, King of the Road!
Better make hay, buddy.
After this, it is one woman for the rest of your life.
Oh, boy.
Yeah I-I never really thought about it in those terms before.
One woman for the rest of my life.
I mean, don't get me wrong.
I mean, she's she's a she's a great woman, but, uh there's only one of her for the rest of my life.
But, you know, it'll go quickly.
Just go-go ahead, cut the cake.
Boy, it really makes you think.
You know, I've been a bachelor a good long time.
I mean, a good lot of women.
Now there won't be any more women.
Just woman.
One woman.
Yeah, but what a woman!
I mean, you know what?
I've got an idea.
Why don't we have some cake?
One perfume.
One set of earlobes.
Not, not even sensitive earlobes.
One pair of lips flapping in my ears day after day until I die.
Oh, my God!
Sammy, Sammy, that's great.
Look, we got a big, wonderful cake here, you know, with a with a very special surprise inside which just might spoil if you don't shut up!
Uh I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
What am I doing?
I mean, if I'm going to tie myself to the old ball and chain, I might as well get one last night of freedom in here.
Okay, bring her out here.
Strap her on.
Come on.
Yeah!
Strap this on!
Sam, you should see the look on your face!
Hi, guys.
Hey, Carla, how was traffic school?
Eh, it was all right.
Yeah?
Well, don't all those gory movies they show kind of turn your stomach a bit?
Hey, Norm, you're forgetting I've seen Diane without makeup.
Hello, everyone.
Hi.
Hello, you.
Let me help you with that.
Well, all right.
Boy, you look fantastic, dear.
That is a great outfit on you.
Sam Hmm?
You make a lousy sycophant.
Yes, but I make a great margarita.
May I speak to you in your office, please?
Sure, anything you want.
You bet cha.
Oh, come on, smile.
For some reason, I don't feel like smiling.
Did I ever tell you how cute you are when you're mad?
Come on, listen, snap out of this, will you?
I mean, I-I didn't say all that stuff last night to hurt your feelings.
My feelings aren't hurt.
I just feel bad for you.
Sentenced to a life with one perfume one set of insensitive earlobes, one set of lips flapping in your ear till you die.
Come on!
I was with a bunch of guys.
I mean, they forced me to make a speech.
How the hell did I know my fiancÃ©e was hiding in the cake, taking dictation?
Did you mean it, Sam?
No.
See, it's just this this whole marriage thing's kind of snuck up on me, that's all.
I mean, I'm happy that you're the only woman I'll make love to again ever.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, but-but, you see I mean, if I had known that the last one was going to be the last one, I-I-I would've prepared myself for it.
Sweetheart, it's kind of like popcorn.
Now, you-you can munch away as long as you know there's a bowlful, but, you know, if all of a sudden, it's all gone, there's nothing left but the salt and the duds, well, you feel bad, because if you'd known the last kernel was the last one, you would've savored it.
Am I making myself clear on this?
Oh, yes, yes Oh.
I'm salt and duds.
Well, I-I-I don't know.
I I don't know what to say to make this right, except I'm sorry.
Would 24 hours of wild, uninhibited, hedonistic sexual carousing with anything in a tube top suffice?
In-in a-addition to saying I'm sorry?
Sam, you can apologize till the cows come home, but it won't alleviate the problem.
After much consideration, I propose that you go on a flesh binge.
Sow your wild oats.
Get it out of your system.
Savor your last kernel of popcorn.
Are you serious?
Absolutely.
It's the only way we can establish a clean slate.
No guilt, no remorse, no regrets.
So dive into that little black book of yours and enjoy.
Oh, you know, I threw that dumb thing away when we got engaged.
I'm sure you have one or two numbers etched in your memory.
You listen to me.
I'm only going to agree to do this because I love you, Diane.
Well, don't do it for me, Sam.
Do it for the health of our future marriage.
Right, right, right.
Uh, excuse me, uh when do my, uh, 24 hours begin?
Right now.
All right.
The same as mine.
Okay.
Wait, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Yours?
Of course, Sam.
This is the only way we can be sure that I have all other men out of my system.
No no Sammy back yet?
Uh, well, uh, "T" minus 30 minutes and counting.
I figure right about now, Sammy's probably leaning back in bed and smoking.
Oh, wait, I don't, uh, remember ever seeing Sammy smoke a cigarette.
Who said anything about cigarettes?
Ho, the man!
All right!
Hey, what's the score, Sammy?
Oh, Norm, you know he's not the kind of guy to kiss and tell not that he wastes much time kissing, anyway, eh, compadre?
Yeah, you guys know me, all right.
So, has anyone, uh anyone heard from Diane?
No, not a word.
It's been heaven.
Ah.
Why?
You worried about her?
No, I'm not worried.
Wha-What makes you think I'm worried?
Uh, what time is it, anyway?
It's time for you to stop worrying.
I mean, for God's sakes, Sammy, who'd be stupid enough to touch Diane?
Besides you.
Good point.
You know, uh, yeah, what am I worried about here?
Oh, Rick, you really came through.
Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam!
Rick was kind enough to drive me to work when my car broke down.
I knew that.
I, uh I just wanted to give him a thank-you shake.
Thank you, thank you.
Uh, maybe I'll, uh, take a rain check on that drink.
Uh, good luck with your marriage.
Yes.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, Rick.
Well I guess I'll just, uh begin my shift.
Uh, yeah, like hell you will!
Sam?
Now, Sam!
Sam!
All right.
Where were you last night, hmm?
I was taking full advantage of my 24 hours.
I looked into the recesses of my heart, and I realized that I still had one oat that needed to be sown.
One fantastic oat.
Is that all you think about-- sex?
You know, it's disgusting!
Wh-Wh-Whatever happened to romance, to commitment?
I mean, look at you!
Look at you-- you haven't even changed your dress!
I am wearing this dress again because I like it.
It sets off my eyes.
Yeah, I'll set off your eyes.
You know You want know something?
I had the exact same 24 hours you did, and I didn't do anything.
You know why?
Because I happen to be a one-woman guy.
I mean, I mean, I think we got something special going here, and I didn't want to cheapen it, like somebody else I could mention.
You-you know, people could refer to you as a tart.
How can you say that?
Easy.
Tart!
Tart, tart, tart, tart!
I mean, what-what else do you call somebody who didn't go home?
How do you know that?
Because I was idiot enough to spend the entire night watching your apartment from my car, and you did not go home.
Well, you must be exhausted.
Yeah, yeah, that's right!
I'm exhausted.
You're damned right, I'm exhausted.
Oh, come on, Sam.
Now, you had a little catnap around 6:00 a.m. Did not.
How'd you know that?
Because I was down the street in my car watching you watch me.
Oh, my God, you spied on me!
I mean, that stinks!
What what hap what happened to faith?
What-what-what happened what happened to trust?
My God!
Sam!
I took a lover's leap of faith in granting you sexual carte blanche for the past 24 hours!
And just as my heart suspected, instead of gallivanting about, you spent the whole time spying on me.
I had one last night to go out and have a great time, and I blow it.
God, I'm a poor excuse for a stud.
I don't know about that.
We still have five minutes left in our deal.
Five minutes?
Mm-hmm.
Well, hell, somebody should've told me that.
Damn it!
How long did you say we have here?
Five minutes.
Not enough time.
Now, come on, Sam.
We'd better skip to the good part.
No come on.
We have to go to work!
Sam!
Whoo!
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
Don't work too hard there, Diane.
I don't mind.
Our wedding day draws ever nearer, and all this conditioning is simply preparation for that special moment.
When you and I exchange rings, my hands must be pristine, because everyone's eyes will be on my fingers.
And everyone's fingers'll be down their throats.
Oh, Carla.
Sweet, pathetic Carla.
Can't you see that I am in far too good a mood to let your petty asides bother me?
I'm afraid you'll just have to find some other way of bugging me.
If you insist.
Making your way in the world today Takes everything you've got Taking a break from all your worries Sure would help a lot Wouldn't you like to get away Sometimes you want to go Where everybody knows your name And they're always glad you came You want to be where you can see Our troubles are all the same You want to be where everybody knows your name You want to go where people know People are all the same You want to go where everybody knows your name.
Yes!
Thank you for telling me.
If you don't hear from me in an hour, I'll be there.
Okay, thank you.
Oh, Sam, uh, may I speak to you for a minute?
Oh, it'd be a new record if you do.
Um, that was a Buddhist monastery called The Glade.
I've been hoping to go on retreat there, and guess what?
They have a vacancy.
Oh, great!
Yeah, I heard all the monks went to Fort Lauderdale this year.
No, Sam, it's not a resort.
It's a contemplative retreat where people go as a means of purifying their souls.
For two weeks, you're isolated from others to commune with yourself.
You are provided with a small room.
You're fed pure, toxin-free foods.
Oh, oh, wait, wait.
And they have the biggest Buddha east of the Mississippi.
Ooh!
Man!
Boy, he is a bruiser, isn't he?
Uh-huh.
Well, it's not exactly Vegas, but, uh, all right, I'll give it a try.
Wh-Wh-What should I bring?
Oh No, Sam I'm going alone.
Only in my solitude can I discover who we are.
Oh, wait-wait a minute here.
This isn't one of those weird cults where they-they mess with your head and you end up handing out flowers at the airport.
You will be coming back, won't you?
No, I won't be coming back, but I will.
I guess I just made up a little Zen koan, didn't I?
Let me explain.
A koan is a a paradox upon which one meditates in order to become more enlightened.
Uh, well, for example, what was your face before your parents were born?
Easy.
A ten.
This is kind of fun.
You got any more?
Well, I'm off to The Glade.
It is all right, isn't it?
Yeah, yeah, what the heck?
Why not?
Sure, go ahead.
Good-bye, my love.
Bye-bye.
Steal me an ashtray.
Hey, hey, hey, is Diane taking the day off again?
No.
Good.
She's taking two weeks off.
No, Sammy, that's not fair!
Come on, she's always takin' off for one stupid reason or another.
Can't we just kill her?
Sh-She's my fiancÃ©e, Carla.
Is that a yes?
No, it's not.
Hey, hey, everybody.
Hey, Cliffie.
What's with your leg?
Eh, I'd rather not talk about it.
Got bitten by a dog.
Ten stitches to close the wound.
I tell you, these unleashed animals are a menace to postal workers.
Well, you're going to sue, aren't you?
Well Now, I may be wrong, Carla, but I don't think you can sue members of the animal kingdom.
I'm talking about the owners, Nellie Belle.
No, there-there's no need to sue.
I left a, uh, strongly worded note in their mailbox.
Well, that's too bad, Cliff.
I know a lawyer who would take it on a contingency basis.
It wouldn't cost you a dime, and you might end up with a sizable settlement.
All right, if it'll get you off my back.
All right.
Cheers.
Yeah, oh, just a minute, please.
Mr. Clavin, for you.
Uh, take a message.
I'll call 'em back, Wood.
Yeah, can he get back to you?
Oh, yes, ma'am.
She wants to know how your leg is.
Eh?
Eh?
See?
The mutt's owner tracked me down.
Well, tell her that she can deep-six that phony concern of hers.
It doesn't cut it with me.
You can deep-six your phony concern.
It doesn't cut it with him.
Tell her my leg and I will see her in court.
His leg and him will see you in court.
Oh, okay, I'll tell him.
Uh, your mom wants you to be home by 6:00 for dinner.
Woody, Woody, why didn't you tell me it was my mother?
I just did.
No, I mean before.
Well, I didn't know it was her till I picked up the phone.
No, Woody When you were talkin' to her, why didn't you say it was her?
She already knew that.
Uh, I'd leave it alone, Cliff.
I think it's one of those Zen koan things.
Eh, buono sera, mi amigos.
Hey, Cliffie, how's your leg?
Oh, stiffening up there, Sammy.
Uh, the muscle's all cramped, and I think the, uh, wound's getting a little infected.
And the mental anguish that goes along with this You know, you just you just can't put a price on this.
Well, let me guess here.
You've seen an attorney.
Yep.
Yeah, yeah, the guy said that, uh, you know, decided in favor of the postman.
Well, good for you, Cliff.
You deserve to get a little satisfaction out of this.
Yeah, yeah, about, uh, Two hundred thousand?
!
Dinner is on Cliff, all right?
Huh, what do you say, buddy?
I'll go upstairs, snag us a table, check out the specials.
I'll be right back.
Eh, eh?
Hey, maybe I could sue somebody about my broken thumb.
I mean, after all, I did slip on the ice.
Well, maybe so.
Where'd it happen?
Right outside the bar here.
No, you don't have a case.
Hey, Cliff?
Huh?
Have you ever thought that you might be suing some poor, sweet, little old lady?
Hey, listen, uh, sharpie, who she is is irrelevant.
It's the letter of the law that's been violated here, and I just can't wait to get her into court and tear her to pieces with my verbal gymnastics.
Um I'm looking for a Mr. Cliff Clavin.
Yep.
You left this note in my mailbox.
I'm afraid it was my dog that bit you.
Uh Uh Excuse me.
Cliffie, wh-what are you trying to say?
Yes, sh-she is very attractive.
Mr. Clavin, I'm terribly sorry about what happened.
Uh, how is your leg?
Cliffie, we're in luck.
The special is filet of filet filet filet Great.
Stereo.
Hey, guys, guys, guys, guys, hey, hey, hey, hey, whoa, whoa!
Sit down, sit down.
Come on, come on, come on.
Can I, uh can I can I offer you a-a drink, Miss?
Keith.
Madeline Keith.
A white wine would be lovely, thank you.
Coming right up.
Look, um I don't have very much money, but I'd like to help with the doctor bills.
That's good.
That's good.
Anything to ease the burden on you and your family.
You're not married.
You're not married.
Oh, oh, I mean, I'm not married.
But I could be if I wanted to, right, Sam?
Sure, Cliff.
Well I can't imagine a man like you living alone.
Uh, uh, I don't live alone.
I live with my mother.
Oh?
Yeah, well, it's, you know, not that I have to.
It's we're related.
Uh, well, you know, don't get me wrong.
I mean, I like her.
Uh No, I think it's wonderful that you're taking care of your mother in her old age.
Oh, uh couldn't throw her out in the street, I guess, huh?
Hey, I mean, who-who'd make my lunch?
Oh, Mr. Clavin You know it's too bad we didn't meet under different circumstances.
We could've been friends.
Yeah I guess that is too bad, huh?
Look here is my number.
If you need anything call me.
Maybe it's just me, but I think that woman's kind of pretty.
Really?
I, uh hadn't noticed.
Too busy thinking about the lawsuit, huh?
Lawsuit?
TV  Jake the Snake is body-slammed to the mat.
He's pinned by Hulk Hogan.
One, two, three!
The Hulk wins it!
Oh, man, that Hulk Hogan is amazing, isn't he?
Woody, the thing is fixed.
Oh, that's too bad.
Hulk Hogan can't have children.
It's evolution's loss.
Hey, everybody.
Cliffie, who died?
The old Cliff Clavin, that's who, Normie.
Nice threads.
Ah, thank you, Sammy.
Can I have a little drink there, uh, Woody?
We have, uh, enough time before Madeline and I go out to dinner this evening.
Wait a minute, are you still seeing each other?
Every day this week, buddy.
Oh, things are getting pretty hot, huh?
Sammy, our relationship is not based merely on the physical, huh?
He isn't getting any.
Well, I, uh, better go check up on our reservations.
Uh, Cliff, I hate to bring up an ugly subject, but, uh Oh, that's okay, Sam.
We're already in the area.
Are-Are you still planning to go through with the lawsuit?
Well, you, uh, you know how slowly the wheels of justice grind there, Samuel.
Uh-oh.
Guess what sap is being suckered into dropping a lawsuit?
Well, now, not necessarily now, all right?
Let's just take a look at all these facts, as complicated as they may be, and see if we can come to a conclusion about this.
Okay, let's start where this gorgeous woman is interested in Cliff, all right?
Now, I don't think we have to go any further than that.
No, now, just a second.
I mean, I don't think we're really being fair.
Now, let's say if an ugly woman were interested in Cliff, would any of us be suspicious?
If a living woman were interested in Cliff, I'd be suspicious.
You know, I got to go along with Dr. Crane on this one.
I can't believe that someone would actually lie just to save a lot of money.
Woody, don't help me, okay?
Listen, somebody's got to tell Cliff the truth.
I guarantee that he'll never talk to the person who does.
Okay, you talked me into it.
Hey, Hopalong!
Come here.
I want to talk to you.
Huh?
I don't know how to tell you this.
Wait a minute.
Yes, I do.
You're an idiot!
Everybody in the bar thinks that babe is playing you for a fool and the second you drop your lawsuit, you're history.
You are a sap.
I know but I'm having the time of my life.
You know, uh, how often am I a sap with a beautiful woman?
I mean, I usually am a sap with the bowsers, but, uh when Madeline and I walk into a restaurant, all the guys' heads, they turn.
And they're not saying, "Hey there's a beautiful woman over there with a sap".
Yes, they are.
Look, all I know is that as long as we're together, there's a good chance she may grant me the, uh, ultimate favor.
Yeah, right, Clavin.
You're threatening to sue her, not kill her.
Oh, uh, Madeline.
You You look ravishing as ever.
Thank you, Cliff.
I thought you would like it.
Like it?
!
If I had better legs, I'd get one for myself.
Oh, Cliff, you're adorable.
Uh, we better get going.
Uh, late for the reservations, huh?
Um, before we go, I think we need to sit down and have a talk.
Is, there, uh, something wrong?
Actually, yes.
What, uh what is it, Madeline?
Well this lawsuit has been preying on my mind, and well, my attorney gave me this.
It's a waiver form.
It releases me from all liability for the dog bite.
And, uh, I guess you want me to sign it, huh?
I want you to tear it up.
Well, I don't understand Please, just tear it up.
When this first began, I thought I could get you to drop the lawsuit, if I was nice to you.
But then, the funniest thing happened.
I grew to like you a lot.
But I'll understand if you hate me for what I was going to do.
I was playing with your emotions when you've been so honest with me.
Uh, well, I-I forgive you, Madeline, uh No, you're a decent guy, Cliff.
Maybe I just better go.
No, uh, Madeline, wait.
Uh, look, I-I-I Anything you did, it doesn't make a difference to me.
You're not just saying that to make me feel better?
No, I swear it.
Scout's honor.
Oh, Cliff, oh!
Oh!
Doesn't it feel good to clear the air?
Oh, yeah, it does.
Look, why don't we forget about the dinner and rent a room somewhere and just celebrate our socks off?
Really?
Well, uh well, the, uh, Ritz is just around the corner.
Why, Cliff, I think that's a wonderful idea.
Carla, would, uh, you be a dear and, uh, cancel dinner reservations for the, uh, Sap party?
We're, uh we're going to have, uh, Ritz service at the room.
I, uh, I meant Ritz service at the room.
Can you believe I said "Ritz service at the room"?
What I meant was, uh, Ritz service at the room.
Cheers.
Oh, hey, Mr. Clavin, what's new?
Sure thing.
Hold on.
Sam, it's for you.
Yeah, Cliff?
Oh, hey, Sammy Sammy?
It's, uh, it's about to happen.
And y-you stopped to call me?
She's, uh, she's in the john putting on her best bib and tucker.
Hey, uh, Sam, can I make a small confession?
Sure.
I'm scared.
Well, Cliff, if it's any consolation, I've seen her, and I'm scared for you.
Oh, my God Oh, Sam Slide over, Cliff.
No, I meant this way, Cliff.
Oh.
Yes, ma'am.
Now isn't this wonderful?
Yeah I wish the guys in the bar could see us.
Really?
: Oh, I mean, you know, it's just a figure of speech.
Uh uh, they just think that we're together because you-you want me to drop the lawsuit and Well, they couldn't be more wrong.
Oh, no, I know, uh I know.
It's just, uh I wish I could, uh convince them of that.
I know.
If only that silly lawsuit were out of the way, I could focus my total attention on you, taking you to a height of ecstasy you never dreamed possible.
Yeah, I could go for that but, uh, well, I, uh I ripped up that release form in the bar.
Well, there No Unless Unless what?
Unless No No, what?
No, tell me.
Well, I happen to have another copy of that release form in my purse.
Oh, what a break!
I'm a lucky guy!
Uh, you got a pen?
Oh!
Oh, I feel a terrible burden lifted off my shoulders.
Oh, yeah.
Me, too.
W-W-W-W-What now?
Well, you just lie back Yeah?
And close your eyes Oh, yeah!
And I'll check my phone messages.
Uh, excuse me?
Well, I get very distracted when I haven't checked my messages.
And you don't want me to be distracted, do you?
Oh, my God!
Uh-oh.
And, uh, she hung up the phone and said, "Cliff, uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but, uh, my husband's come back".
Wait a minute now.
She's married all this time and never told you?
Yeah.
Seems that her husband, a true and gallant soldier of these United States, was, uh, lost and presumed dead during some, uh, secret mission out there in the Far East.
Oh, as it turns out, he was only wounded, and although he suffered, uh, years of torture, see, uh, uh, somehow, he managed to, uh, dig a tunnel with a pair of chopsticks and make his way to a, uh, pay phone and, uh, give her a call.
Cliff, this is an unbelievable story.
Oh, yeah, Sammy.
It's unbelievable to me, and I was there.
But, uh, she barely had time to blow me a kiss and wish me a happy life, and, uh then she was gone like a dream in the night.
What a maroon.
I I guess we were like a pair of lovers that were never meant to be.
Like Romeo and Juliet Rhett, Scarlett Heathcliff, Kathy Heath, Cliff and Kathy?
Isn't that three people, Mr. Clavin?
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
Hey, what're you doing there, Norm?
Oh, Vera signed me up to give a speech at her Women's Auxiliary Club.
I hate public speaking.
Yeah, you're not alone there, pal.
Well, it's awful, you know.
You're standing there in front of a group of total strangers palms sweating, your throat dry, your mouth feels like it's full of cotton.
your knees practically buckling.
It can be a miserable experience.
I tell you.
So what's the topic?
"Poise: The Key to Success".
Making your way in the world today Takes everything you've got Taking a break from all your worries Sure would help a lot Wouldn't you like to get away Sometimes you want to go Where everybody knows your name And they're always glad you came You want to be where you can see Our troubles are all the same You want to be where everybody knows your name You want to go where people know People are all the same You want to go where everybody knows your name.
Thanks, Mom.
Yeah, don't worry about it.
I'll find somebody to sit for the kids.
Bye.
She can't do it?
She's scared to.
Oh, yeah, I'll, uh, watch the kids for you, Carla.
It's not fair.
This always happens to me when I have a date on a weeknight.
Oh, who's the lucky guy?
My butcher.
Oh, yeah?
What happened to Eddie?
Eddie's in Vancouver.
My butcher's three blocks down.
Life is short.
I wouldn't mind, uh, looking after your kids for you, Carla.
What am I gonna do now?
Well, I'd do it, but I'm working on Wednesday.
Yeah.
Yeah, Vera and I would love to, but, uh, we have this thing Wednesday night.
Yeah, uh, Diane and I have a thing, too.
Yeah.
Maybe it's the same thing.
I don't think so.
Probably not.
Oh, I'm, uh, I'm not busy Wednesday.
Well, guess I'm gonna have to cancel my date.
Well, is this a day to press in your memory books or what?
Well, you guys sound pretty chipper.
Shall I tell them, Lilith?
Out with it, or I'm liable to burst with anticipation.
Doctors Sternin and Crane are proud to announce that they are now officially POSSLQ's.
It means "Persons of the Opposite Sex Sharing Living Quarters".
Yes.
Oh.
You see, it's a little, uh, lovers' in-joke we picked up from a Census Bureau acronym.
Oh, I love those.
Well, man, hey, that's great.
Congratulations.
Yes, yes.
Thank you.
But this is quite a surprise.
You've only known each other a few months, and you're moving in together?
That's pretty impetuous.
Well, a week ago, we decided to take a chance on cohabitation, but we waited a week before announcing the news, so as to avoid putting any undue pressure on the success or failure of the endeavor.
And now we are pleased to announce the effort a limited success.
Yes, pretty darn impetuous.
Well, we thought that the two of you were responsible for Lilith and I finding each other in this cockeyed world, so, we, uh, we thought we'd like to have you over for dinner on Wednesday night as our very first guests.
Aw.
Why, we'd be honored.
Yeah, I'll be there.
Great.
We'll get away from the hurly-burly of this place and concentrate completely on the lost art of conversation.
Hmm.
I'll be there anyway.
All right, Wednesday night it is then.
Oh, uh, shall we say, oh, uh, what Wonderful.
You don't know how happy this makes me.
So, you and Diane have this thing Wednesday night, huh?
Well, why don't you just come out and say it?
You don't want to spend an evening alone with my kids.
We don't want to spend an evening alone with your kids.
Neither do I. But what choice do I have?
Well Carla, I think Cliff might be interested in watching them.
Hey, hey, what are you doing Wednesday night?
Pumping iron.
Okay, Cliff, you're up.
Be at my house Wednesday at 6:00.
But remember, you asked for it.
Here, come here.
Here obviously, she doesn't think that I can handle the kids, huh?
Yeah, but my guess is that, uh, they'll settle down once they're confronted with a strong male authority figure.
Are you bringing your mom?
I'm home, sweet potato.
Just a moment, cinnamon bear.
How was your day?
Oh, I want to take you now, by the dip.
You impulsive man.
We have guests coming.
Yes, I know.
It'll be our little joke on them.
Every time they say the word "dip," we'll become giddy with remembrance.
The word itself will become a syllable filled with our overwhelming passion.
Dear, you're using sex to express your aggression toward the confines of polite society.
Dip.
I love that.
What is that heavenly aroma coming from the kitchen?
Dinner.
Oh, yes, of course, dinner.
Well, I'm sorry I'm late, by the way.
I got No explanation is necessary.
I know you far too well to have expected you to be on time tonight.
Oh, right.
Why is that?
Because I've learned that a certain self-centered insensitivity is a fundamental part of your psychological makeup.
And it only endears you to me.
I'm so glad you shared that with me.
Of course you can't know everything about me.
I mean, who would have thought that I'd enjoy living with you, but here we are.
You didn't expect to enjoy living with me?
Well, you do have a uncompromising quality.
Mm.
A very attractive one it is, though.
Well, if you were hesitant, why do it?
That's the way you arranged it, isn't it?
It was your idea.
Ah, yes, well, you see, you're forgetting the, uh, passive-aggressive trick you have of leading someone else into doing something that you want to do, thereby absolving yourself of responsibility.
And very adorable it is, too, my little parsnip.
Why do you insist on displaying your magazines in that insipid accordion design?
I'm sorry if this one little touch of theatrical flair is too much for your retentive nature.
We'll go into my retentive nature later.
For now, we have guests coming.
You know, I see what you're trying to do here.
You want me to begin the argument that you wish you could start yourself.
Well, I will not do it.
If you want to have an altercation, you will have to How could you be late on a night like this?
!
Didn't you know I'd be nervous making my first dinner in your house while your stupid friends are looking at me and judging my every move?
I'll never forgive you for this!
Never, never, never, never!
Just a minute!
Darling, I think that was a real breakthrough.
So come out of the bathroom, and after dinner, we'll build on it.
But, our-our guests are here now.
Dear heart?
Darling.
Coming!
Coming!
Hi!
Come in, come in!
I hope we're not early.
Oh, no, no, no, your timing is just perfect.
Oh.
Boy, am I hungry.
Sam.
Well, I am.
So, where's your lovely POSSLQ?
Oh, she's around somewhere.
Peach blossom?
Don't make yourself too beautiful.
I can hardly stand to look at you now.
: Come on please come out, darling.
Please.
: What was that?
Oh, uh got something stuck in her contact lens.
Oh, I hate that.
Yeah.
Li-Listen, here, come sit down, relax.
Uh, pour yourself some wine, whatever.
Just, uh, make yourselves comfortable.
Oh, oh, Diane, could you hand me that cheese knife, please?
Thank you.
Uh, enjoy.
I'll be right back.
What do you think you're doing?
!
Might I have a little privacy?
We can resolve all this later, but for now, these people may be my friends, but they are not the greatest conversationalists in the world, and I could use your help.
Good chips.
Lilith.
Ah.
Welcome to our home.
I am so happy for the both of you.
Yeah, absolutely.
Congratulations.
Yeah, that's great.
Love what you've done with this place, man.
Oh, yes, I love the masculine touches.
Thank you.
Say, that, uh, that dip looks good.
Mmm.
Dip?
Yeah, the, uh, the dip.
Could you, uh, pass it, please?
: Yes, of course.
Be my guest.
Here you are.
Oh, thank you.
Oh Oh, yeah, that is great dip.
Mmm, here.
Yeah, try it.
Mmm, delicious, Lilith.
Frasier, have you tried some of Lilith's dip?
Yes, I-I have, yes.
Well, then I don't have to tell you how good it is.
Mmm.
It's quite good.
Well, I don't mean to hog it here.
Uh, you guys look hungry.
He-Help yourself.
So, Frasier, was it good for you, too?
What the hell's in this dip?
Well may I propose a toast?
Mmm!
To your house.
Our house.
Hear, hear.
Yes.
?
Our house ?
Oh, I love that.
Is a very, very, very fine house With two cats in the yard Life used to be so hard Now everything is easy 'cause of you And our Our house : ?
Is a very, very, very fine house ?
With two cats in the yard : ?
Life used to be so hard ?
?
Now ?
Et cetera, et cetera.
You know what I love about your relationship?
No.
You never seem to have an unexpressed thought.
I've noticed that.
How do you maintain that level of honesty?
Well, it's simple.
Frasier and I keep no secrets from each other.
Oh, come on.
You don't mean to tell me you tell each other everything.
Certainly.
Exactly.
We've bared our souls to each other.
Oh, now no guy's going to tell his brand-new girlfriend about all the women he You know.
Oh, but there must be no secrets in that area.
That's where honesty counts most.
Gee, you know, I-I'm afraid I don't think that's such a good idea.
You mean the two of you, planning marriage, haven't already had this discussion?
Of course we have.
Well, Diane's told us about both of hers, and we're just about up to the Johnson Administration on mine.
Uh, seriously, though, um, I-I think that we're all entitled to our little secrets.
Why?
They only lead to embarrassment when they're inevitably revealed.
Exactly.
I know I feel better knowing that Frasier has told you he and I were once engaged, so I don't have to worry about you discovering it at some inopportune moment.
Like now, for instance.
Dear dear, I thought I told you that Diane and I used to date.
Date, yes.
That you had decided to marry and spend the rest of your life with her, no.
Semantics.
And why were you afraid to tell me that one detail?
Because she still means something to you, doesn't she?
She means absolutely nothing to me.
I mean, if I notice her at all, it's merely as an annoyance, like a bug flying around in a room.
Diane, Diane, be a dear.
Would you grab me the cheese knife, please?
Frasier, I'm sorry this happened, but I think it would be best for everyone if you told her the truth.
Diane's right.
All right, all right.
Darling, I'm going to tell you the whole truth.
Out with it.
All right, uh, Diane and I were engaged to be married and she left me at the altar.
The whole experience was so humiliating, I-I-I've just been trying to forget it ever since.
Your feelings for her were genuine?
Yes.
And it's only on account of her action that you're not married to her at this very moment?
Well, I-I never really looked at it that way.
And if Sam were out of the picture, you'd throw me over and run back to her, wouldn't you?
I don't love her anymore.
You switch your passions on and off very quickly, Dr. Crane.
I do not!
Then you do still love her!
Well, I never did!
You were going to marry her!
Well, maybe I just thought I loved her!
How do I know you don't just think you love me?
Well, I don't.
I mean, I-I didn't I-I never I will not be grilled like a common criminal!
Cheese knife?
All right, thank you very much.
Bye.
Ordering another round for the corner table, honey.
All right, Corinne.
Now listen, uh, thanks a lot for subbin' on such short notice.
Hey, this is my life.
It shouldn't, uh, it shouldn't be so bad.
You know, it's not really very crowded tonight.
That's what you said the last time.
When I got home, my can was dragging this far off the ground.
Thanks for sharing that with us, Corinne.
Well, that was Carla's daughter.
She said that, uh, the kids are going to drop off Mr. Clavin.
All right.
All right.
I don't think her kids are old enough to drive.
What was that?
Cliff!
Cliff!
Cliff, Cliff buddy, are you all right?
Wait, there's a note.
"Don't open until Christmas".
Aw, shoot.
Now look here, Lilith, you needn't worry about Frasier carrying a torch for me.
I assure you he feels nothing but resentment toward me.
He knows I was using him to forget the real love I felt, and feel, for Sam here.
Is there any more Chex Mix?
You see, Sam is my real love.
I'm ashamed to say that Frasier was a convenient dalliance on my part, at a time when I needed someone, anyone.
I'm sorry it was him.
So, essentially, Frasier was a toy you played with briefly and then threw away.
Well, it wasn't that bad.
A fellow human being, whose emotions you twisted for your own satisfaction, with no consideration for his feelings.
Frasier had some fun.
We would speak nothing but French on Sundays.
I heard it all.
How could I have been so blind?
Don't blame yourself.
That's right.
You can't blame anyone in these situations.
He can blame you.
Now look here.
Our relationship was a two-way street.
Yes, and I was run over in both directions.
Oh, Frasier, you had fun.
Diane, I never had a whit of fun, especially on Sundays.
And the only thing more egregious than your French pronunciation is your syntax.
Dinner, everyone.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait.
Come on, this whole thing has gone on too far here.
Hey, listen up.
This is what happens when you open old wounds.
I mean, I don't know what happened between Frasier and Diane, but it seems to me they had a little fun, but they just weren't right for each other.
But now that they've found somebody that, uh, is right for them, I-I think you both should be happy for each other.
And leave it at that.
Oh.
Je regrette, mes amis.
I'm sorry, too, Diane.
I don't know what came over me.
Diane, can you forgive me?
Oh, I'm the one who's sorry.
And happy for both of you.
Thank you.
And thank you, Sam.
Yes.
Mmm, well, I just thought it went on long enough.
Besides, I-I have to use the bathroom here.
Would anyone like some more lasagna?
No, thank you.
I think we've had our fill.
Fine, then I'll just get the coffee.
Lasagna?
I wasn't even thinking Italian.
Well, I was closest.
I said something with meat.
That will be all then, Jill.
You can come by and clean up in the morning.
Thank you, Dr. Sternin.
You mean you had someone back there helping you with this?
With the side dishes, yes.
But at the risk of sounding immodest, I have to take credit for the lasagna myself.
Oh, well.
Well, bravo.
Well, shall we adjourn to the living room for some coffee?
Nice.
Oh, may I propose another toast?
Why stop at seven?
Hah.
Well, we have all learned a valuable lesson this evening.
We shouldn't be frightened of the past, or of any affairs our lovers have had.
Indeed, we should be grateful for those past experiences because they've made him or her the person we love today.
Hear, hear.
Well said.
Oh, hey, let me, uh, fill some of these wine glasses here.
Good night, Dr. Sternin.
Good night.
Oh, Sam Malone!
Oh, you beautiful man!
Where have you been keeping yourself?
Hey, Jill, how the hell you been, huh?
Great, just great.
Well, you still doing massage?
Just the way you like 'em.
Who is this, Sam?
Uh, you know, it's gettin' kinda late.
Maybe you oughta take off.
Bye-bye.
Huh!
Why is it that we cannot go to one, single, solitary place in the entire city of Boston without running into some woman that you've had a fling with?
Oh, come on, you're exaggerating here.
Mm-hmm.
At the market, at the movies, when we got our blood test, for heaven's sake.
Well, what're we supposed to do, move?
I mean, come on.
Excuse me.
Oh, now, don't, no, don't-don't go What-what're you so upset about?
I wasn't even dating you when I went out with Jill.
That's when you were living with Frasier.
She lived with you?
Well, only briefly.
Uh You said you'd never lived with anyone but me!
Yeah, open that's right.
What are you doing?
I should have thought of this earlier.
Yeah.
What was that?
Frasier, what are you doing?
Frasier, the door seems to be jammed.
Frasier?
Sam, open the door.
Macanudo?
Oh!
Frasier!
Don't mind if I do.
Thank you.
Open the door.
You know, I don't think I can stand this caterwauling in here.
Why don't we go upstairs.
I've got all 13 episodes of I, Claudius on tape.
Great.
Man, I love gladiator flicks.
Frasier, we are not amused!
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
Well, I'm out of here, I guess.
Going to stop over at the health club.
You belong to a health club?
Yeah, yeah.
Vera gave me a membership for my birthday.
It's, uh, real subtle, huh?
You-You actually go there and work out?
Yeah.
I try to do, uh, about Laps?
Cannonballs.
Making your way in the world today Takes everything you've got Taking a break from all your worries Sure would help a lot Wouldn't you like to get away Sometimes you want to go Where everybody knows your name And they're always glad you came You want to be where you can see Our troubles are all the same You want to be where everybody knows your name You want to go where people know People are all the same You want to go where everybody knows your name.
Uh, great, Miss Harville, thanks.
Hot dog!
What's up?
They just delivered my new mattress.
Finally, a decent night's rest.
Now all I got to do is figure out what to do with my old mattress.
Any suggestions?
Well, mine's in the Smithsonian.
Oh, will they send a truck?
Hey, Frasier!
The usual?
Oh, not just yet.
I'm meeting a friend for a drink.
Simon Finch-Royce.
Mm.
Dr. Simon Finch-Royce, the n-noted marriage counselor?
No, Dr. Finch-Royce, the circus geek.
Ah.
Yes, of course, the marriage counselor.
We were students together when I was a Rhodes Scholar.
Wow, you were a Rhodes Scholar?
Tell me this: how come the stuff they fill in the potholes with is darker than the rest of the road?
I don't know, Woody.
I missed that day.
And now it's come back to haunt you.
Sam Simon Finch-Royce is an eminent psychotherapist who specializes in marital relations.
Does "eminent" by any chance mean "rich and single"?
Anyway, Sam, I think it's safe to say that he has saved hundreds, nay, thousands of troubled marriages.
It's even rumored that he had a hand in helping Chuck and Di.
Speaking of that, why don't you upchuck and die?
Three little maids from school are we Pert as a schoolgirl well may be Filled to the brim with girlish glee Three little maids from school.
Sam, you want me to call the police?
Uh, no no cause for alarm, Woody.
Simon and I did the spring musical together at Oxford.
It was The Mikado.
Simon played Pitti-Sing, and I was Yum-Yum.
And a handsomer Yum-Yum I've never seen.
It's good to see you, Simon.
Uh, how was your flight?
All right?
Oh, relatively crash-free.
Can I buy you a drink?
Yes, a pint of beer, but none of that weak-kneed American bile.
Give me, uh, a little something with hair on it.
Here I am.
So, uh, you married?
Yes, quite happily.
Too bad.
Could've been my first Englishman.
No, no, no, wait, there was that one other guy, but he was so white, I kept losing him in the sheets.
Do we know her?
Yes, that's Carla.
Have her scrubbed and sent to my tent.
Sam, a Guinness for my friend.
Guinness coming right up.
Oh, Simon, by the way: Sam Malone, Woody Boyd.
Simon Finch-Royce.
Hi.
Hi.
Howdy.
Howdy.
Oh, and, uh, this is Diane Chambers.
Oh, how do you do?
Delighted to make your acquaintance.
You're so much taller than you looked on your book jacket.
Ah, yes, but you see, the book's only about that big.
That must be it.
So, what brings you here?
Oh, I'm accepting an honorary degree.
It's nothing much-- just a small college-- but, uh, any excuse to pop over the pond.
Doc, uh, Hi.
I'm Norm Peterson.
Oh.
I have to tell you that my wife is a big fan of yours, sir.
Oh.
Yeah, she reads all those marriage improvement books.
Great.
Have they helped?
Well, they've helped me.
It, uh, gives her something to do in bed.
I have a few questions Thank you, Norm.
Shall we just go over here, where it's a little quieter?
Splendid idea.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, Frasier, please join us.
Oh, Sam, may I have a seltzer, please?
You know, I had a thought.
Sam and I are about to be married, and dare I ask it, could you be persuaded to possibly have a session or two with us?
Oh, Diane I think it's a capital idea.
Ah, well, then, let it be my wedding gift to you.
I was considering the gravy boat, but I think our relationship transcends mere crockery.
Are you sure you don't mind?
Oh, not at all.
I'm a terrible workaholic.
And also, it'll be refreshing to work with a couple who are not on the brink of disaster.
Thank you, Sam.
Will you excuse us for a minute here?
Can I talk to you for a minute, please?
Oh, excuse me.
Why do you want to do this?
We're not in trouble.
We're not even married yet.
Sam, marriage counselors aren't just for people who are having troubles.
His expertise will help us lay a solid foundation for our married life.
: Now, what say we give it a go?
Hey, wh-what's with this English accent?
Ever since he walked in here, you-you been talking like the queen was your Aunt Betty or something.
: Oh, tosh.
What twaddle.
See, th Hey, yeah, but, you know, so, if you Brits ever find yourself in trouble against, uh, another major military power like Argentina, you know, one thing is, uh, well, we Yanks'll be there to bail you out just like we were during the last two big ones, huh?
Cliffie, Cliff!
There's a gentleman over here that thinks you know absolutely nothing about photosynthesis.
Oh, yeah, who?
Why Why, I'll straighten him out.
The first paper that was done So, Doctor, when shall we begin?
Why not right now?
Sure.
Is-is there anywhere with a little privacy?
Well, there's Sam's office.
You don't mind, do you, Sam?
Of course you don't.
Lovely.
Oh, Simon, Simon, this is strictly professional.
I want you to bill me for this.
Oh, right.
Yes.
And I do want you to completely disregard our years and years of friendship when determining your fee.
Oh, well, whatever you say.
Look, I mean it, now.
I-I'll hear nothing of that 40% psychiatrist's courtesy discount that's customary here in the States.
I wouldn't dream of insulting you.
Well, I'm glad we worked that out.
Well, now, uh, where to begin.
Well, usually, at this point, you would tell me what a loathsome, contemptible swine he is, and, uh, you would describe in some detail what a wanton, libidinous trollop she is but as you're only engaged, we'll just have to look forward to that.
When I was on the staff of the London Psychiatric Hospital just after my divorce, we had a couple that Excuse me.
Hmm?
You've been divorced?
Yes, I have.
: That's great.
Now, Sam, Sam, I can say to you with pride, "Yes, I have been divorced," because it is only from our failures that we gain knowledge.
Consequently, I was able to make a much better choice of a second wife.
Perhaps my vision was clearer for the tears that I had shed.
You are the wisest man I know.
High praise, indeed.
Well, now, uh I need to begin to get to know you two, so, Diane, why don't, why don't you start?
Well, they say you don't have prenatal memories, but I have a distinct in-utero recollection of a Fourth of July concert my mother attended.
There was at least one Souza march And then he proposed to me in, of all places, a court of law.
This time I acquiesced and agreed to become Mrs. Malone  which brings us here today.
You know, my wife has a skirt very similar to the one you're wearing.
Sam a little of your history, please.
Oh, right, all right.
Okay, uh Let's see, uh, it was, uh, August 5, 1973.
I, uh, got my first major league save.
It was in Baltimore.
Sam, you don't have to go into all of that.
If you can go back to the womb, I can go back to the damn Oriole doubleheader.
Anyway, uh sweltering day.
Frank Robinson had been killing me all season, but this day, I'm telling you it happened every single time.
Which means that, no matter what town you were in, these women would just hang around outside your locker room, I mean, complete strangers, and-and throw themselves at you?
Yeah.
: It was great.
Well, uh, moving on.
Now, um, what-what are the keys to a successful marriage?
Well, there are numerous schools of thought.
Uh, many experts claim that the most important single ingredient in a marriage is Quickly now.
Love?
Sex.
Honesty because from honesty springs Fidelity.
Sex.
Yes, trust.
Oh, I was going to say that.
Well, those people are wrong.
Now, during the, uh, course of my counseling, I have come up with a number of scenarios, the responses to which give very useful pointers to a couple's compatibility.
So, Sam, we'll start with you.
You're on your honeymoon.
With Diane?
With Diane.
Now, the two of you are on a tropical beach wearing nothing but your swimming togs.
Uh, Doctor, I do have a tendency to freckle.
Diane is wearing a big hat.
Now, Sam, you see a woman walk by.
Her flesh is tawny from the tropic sun.
Her proud yet supple bosoms heave mightily against the constraints of her tiny bikini.
You think she is the most beautiful creature that you have ever seen.
At this moment, Diane turns to you and says, "A penny for your thoughts".
Do you share them with her?
Uh, gee, that's, uh, that's hard to say.
Wh-When you say "bikini", is it that French cut?
Sam!
I'm just trying to clarify things here.
All right, all right, do I tell her?
Um No, of course not.
You wouldn't trust me to handle that?
Well, yes, of course I would.
Did I say no?
I meant yes.
All right.
Diane, it's your wedding night.
You and Sam have just made love, and Sam has not performed to your satisfaction.
He asks you how it was.
Do you tell him?
I never have before.
: I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.
I tell you I'm kidding.
Of course I wouldn't tell him.
It would hurt his feelings.
Fine.
Well, I just have to express my appreciation that you've been so open with me.
I've heard enough.
That's it?
Of course, Sam, that's all he has to hear.
The good doctor is a brilliant man.
I'm sure he has a complete handle on our relationship.
Yes, I have.
You two should not only not get married, you should never see each other again.
What?
!
Well, I'm sorry to be so blunt, but sometimes a surgeon has to cut in order to cure.
Whoa what's the problem?
Well, would that there were only one, but there are so many.
Oh, yeah, yeah, I see what you mean.
I mean first of all, and most obviously, you have absolutely nothing in common.
Then, on top of that, you have an appalling lack of communication.
What about the idea that opposites attract?
Ah, the song of the truly desperate.
Well, take it from take it from one who has observed dozens of failed marriages-- the only thing that opposites attract is divorce.
Well, don't, wait a minute, don't go.
What shall we do?
Well, think yourselves lucky.
I mean, you found out now.
Saved yourself years, perhaps decades, of pain and heartache.
Cheerio.
Ah, Simon!
Simon, I've signed a blank check.
Now, remember, no favors.
I want you to fill in your regular fee.
Oh, as you wish.
Thanks.
Say, excuse me, I must dash back to the hotel.
Oh, listen, just for my ledger, uh, what amount should I fill in?
$1,500.
Fine.
$1,500.
Done.
Pretentious limey bastard.
Well, what am I saying?
It was your wedding gift and he is the best.
The man's a quack.
Imagine he had the nerve to say that Sam and I shouldn't get married.
: That we have absolutely nothing in common.
Excuse me, Diane.
What exactly do you two have in common?
Well, we Wait a minute.
Somebody suggesting Sam and Diane aren't right for each other.
Now, where have I heard that be Of course.
My prayers.
What are we gone do?
We're going to get married, of course.
We're not going to listen to that sack of fish 'n' chips.
Wait a minute.
Why, that wily old bird.
He's brilliant.
Hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it.
First, he's brilliant, then he's a quack, and now he's brilliant again?
!
Don't you see?
It was a test.
He was testing our resolve in the face of his pronouncement.
Come on, let's go to his hotel.
No, I don't want to do that.
Come on.
Sam, we have to prove to him that we are indivisible.
Oh, I can't believe that I almost fell for the oldest trick in the book.
Come on.
Why, I thought the oldest trick in the book was the one where the guy tells you you got a spot on your shirt and then when you look down, bud-oom-- flicks you in the nose.
Well, uh, Woody, you do have a spot on your shirt there.
Ah, no, no, no, no, no, Mr. Clavin.
I'm not falling for that.
I'm much too smart for you.
Wait, no, no, Woody, Woody.
You, you got a spot right there.
Yeah, yeah, right.
You're not gone make me look like a dope.
No, darling, I've settled in for the evening.
I'm desperate for a bit of peace and quiet, so I'll just have a bite to eat and a bath and pop into bed.
Oh, that pompous twit Frasier Crane says hello.
Yes, bad as usual, if not worse.
Still, you may be amused to know I stuck him for $1,500.
Oh, uh, excuse me, darling.
There's someone at the door.
Shall we say Yes, all right.
Yes, I love you, too.
Oh!
Hello, Doctor.
Ah, this is a surprise.
Uh, sorry about this.
We didn't catch you on the hopper, did we?
Uh No, but thanks for asking.
Come in.
This will only take a moment.
You know, you're a very clever man.
It wasn't until after you'd left that we realized you were merely testing our resolve.
So we stand before you now as proof we are steadfast in our devotion to one another.
Well, that's very lovely, but it wasn't a test.
Oh, listen to him, Sam.
It's yet another test.
I'm afraid I haven't made myself sufficiently clear.
Um you two are an accident waiting to marry.
Well, you couldn't be more wrong.
If you only knew the enormous obstacles we've overcome, you would know that we are destined to die in each other's arms.
Because, although we are very different people, our parts mesh together perfectly.
We have achieved symbiosis.
Well, not every time, but it's close.
Sorry about this.
Aren't we all?
All I'm saying is maybe he's right.
Maybe we should give it some thought.
Maybe we should wait.
Maybe I'm a confirmed bachelor.
Maybe you'll do me the honor of sticking a sock in it.
I take it it didn't go so well.
He claims it wasn't a test.
If you ask me, his methods are highly suspect.
How can he say that we are mismatched on the basis of two silly questions.
I didn't even answer mine accurately.
I said what I thought he wanted to hear.
Sam, did you answer the way you wanted to answer or the way you thought he wanted you to answer?
Or the way you thought I wanted you to answer?
I don't know, I got confused after the babe in the bikini walked by.
Well, Diane, did you tell Simon all this?
No, I didn't.
But I'm going to now.
Come on, Sam.
We just came back from that hotel.
I'm not going back there again.
Sam, this is a crucial point in our relationship.
Oh, I am starved.
I haven't eaten all day.
Come on.
Uh, both of you, go to Finch-Royce.
Tell him the truth.
Let him make an accurate assessment of your relationship.
You owe it to me.
You owe it to him.
And most of all, you owe it to yourselves.
Now don't come back until you're fully satisfied.
I don't care how long it takes.
All right, all right.
Right.
Thank you.
Frasier Crane can play hardball, too.
If you need anything else, just let me know.
Oh, thank you.
Now, are you sure the soup is piping hot this time?
Oh, yes, sir.
I burned myself on the bowl.
Excellent.
Ah, how lovely to see you again.
What's it been, 30 minutes?
I'm sorry to barge in.
I hope we're not disturbing you.
Well, actually, I was just about to have my dinner.
Dinner?
Yes, I mean, uh, I don't want to sound rude, but I actually would like to eat it while it's hot.
I'm sorry, but this is simply too important to put it off.
It's been preying on our minds.
We really can't think of anything else.
Isn't that right, Sam?
Yeah, right.
Are you gone eat those crackers?
Yes, I am.
Now, could you please just say whatever it is you've come to say?
Very well.
From the moment of your pronouncement, we felt that you were wrong, and now we realize why.
We gave you the wrong answers to your questions about the honeymoon.
We've thought it over and now we want to give you our real answers.
Yes, well, it doesn't matter what you say now.
You see, I mean, what matters is your first response, your gut reaction.
I mean, you've had two hours to think about it now.
Yes, well, sometimes, it takes Sam two hours to come up with his first thought.
I don't, I don't appreciate that.
You know, it was your stupid idea to come here in the first place.
All of a sudden, he says something you don't like and now you, you don't believe him anymore?
Well, he's wrong.
He doesn't know what he's talking about.
Don't you think he's capable of making a mistake?
That's highly unlikely-- although I did let the two of you in.
Excuse me, um Come on, let's get out of here, will you?
I'm starved, I'm gone go have some dinner.
You want to join me?
Please say yes.
Oh, I wondered what was keeping you.
I was beginning to get worried.
Did we get you out of the shower?
No, no, no, no, the, uh, the soup was so hot it set off the sprinkler system.
Sam and I have been to the library and we've done extensive research.
We're here to tell you that you are full of rubbish.
How thoughtful.
Most people would only have phoned.
Now, if you'll just examine the parts that I have marked I think I've shown remarkable restraint so far, but I have had just about enough of this.
Now, I've said that you're not compatible and you have done nothing to show me otherwise.
Look, I don't know what we're supposed to do or what we're supposed to say, but we're here, fighting for our lives together.
Now doesn't that count for something?
No.
Why not?
Well, let me answer you this way: Sam, do you really want to be here?
No.
Oh, what do you mean "no"?
I mean no.
I don't want to be here.
I mean, this whole thing was your stupid idea.
What do we care if this guy doesn't think we should get married?
Nobody we know thinks we should get married.
We don't go bugging them in the middle of the night, do we?
All right, what do you suggest we do?
Nothing.
Oh!
That's your solution to everything: nothing!
Is that what you're going to do for the rest of your life: nothing?
I haven't decided yet.
I've grown to hate them.
That's it.
I've died and gone to hell.
Doctor, there's one thing you haven't considered.
Right.
Fine.
All right.
Okay.
Um, Sam, Diane, you two are perfect together.
I'm sorry I made a mistake, but I now see that you are the most perfectly matched couple on the face of the earth.
But, why, why am I telling you this?
Let's, let's share it with the rest of the world, shall we?
Hear this, world, the rest of you can stop getting married now!
It's been done to perfection!
Envy them, sofa.
Envy them, chair.
For you shall never be as cozy as they.
For I guarantee that their marriage will be a total epoch-shattering success.
And I stake my life on it!
Wait, let, let me put that on record.
I, Dr. Simon Finch-Royce, being of sound mind, declare that Sam and Diane shall be together throughout all eternity, and if I am wrong, I hereby promise that I will take my own life in the most disgusting manner possible!
Here, take the tape.
No, no, no, no, no!
Take the whole machine.
It's my wedding gift to you-- to you, the most perfect couple since the dawn of time!
See?

Hey, come on.
We're not that busy around here.
What're you doing?
As a matter of fact, why don't why don't you go to the play with Diane?
Ha.
How about it, Carla?
We rarely do things together.
We never do things together.
It'll be fun.
It'll broaden your horizons.
You what're you saying?

Greetings, everyone.
Hey, Doctor.
A beer, stout yeoman.
Boy, you're in a good mood, Dr. Crane.
And why shouldn't I be?
Next week marks the anniversary of the day my beloved Lilith and I first met.
No kiddin'?
Yeah.
As a show of my affection, I bought her a Louis Quatorze armoire at a little antique shop I saw on the Hill today.
It set me back quite a penny.
You know, I think when you're trying to express your affection for your mate, old wood says it best.
What do I say?
I was talking about the armoire.
I never say that.
I don't even know what an armoire is.
It's a large chest.
Well, hey, what woman wouldn't want that?
So, uh, what's Lilith getting you there, Doc?
A set of golf clubs.
Eh.
Although she doesn't know it yet.
Well, how can you be so sure?
Well, I've left a lot of clues around the house.
You'd have to be an idiot not to know what I want.
And what's that, Dr. Crane?
I-I haven't decided yet, Wood.
Ah.
So, uh eh, Doc, I didn't know you were a fellow linkster.
You know, uh, someday, when you feel you're good enough, I'll, uh, take you down to my private country club for a little, uh, mano a mano.
Eh, Normie, remember I took you down?
I had a great time.
I got, uh, three holes in one, and I birdied the windmill.
Hey, barkeep, I hear you pour a mean root beer in this saloon.
Joyce?
Oh, my God.
Joyce.
Hi.
Surprise.
Oh.
Ha.
Boy, look at you.
It's been ages, you know that?
Yeah.
Hey, everybody, this is Coach's niece, Joyce Pantusso.
Nice to meet you.
Look at you.
It's so good to see you.
Oh, we couldn't be more thrilled to have you here.
Who are you?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Diane Chambers, Sam's fiancÃ©e.
Oh.
I'm sure he must've mentioned me.
Oh, no.
Well, it must have been an oversight.
Anyway, it's so nice.
We finally get to meet.
We've all got goose bumps.
Sit down here.
Let me get you a soda or something.
Oh, I'll get it.
I'll get it.
All right.
Thanks, thanks.
Why didn't you tell me you were coming to Boston?
Well, I wanted to surprise you.
I start college at BU in the spring quarter.
Oh, my God.
A Pantusso attending college.
Yeah.
A Pantusso pronouncing college.
Yeah, yeah, my mom and dad are really proud.
Oh, I'll bet.
Tell me, how-how-how's everybody at Reedsport?
Well, um, the family's fine.
Would you believe the twins are starting high school.
No kidding.
Who are the twins?
Mom's calligraphy business is, uh, doing well.
Yeah?
Well, what about that nutty wild man dad of yours?
Oh, God, Coach's baby brother.
I mean, you never knew what he was going to do next.
Oh, he threw his back out vacuuming.
What a nut, huh?
Oh, you know what?
He asked me to give you something.
There you go.
Oh.
Sam.
Beer distributor on the phone.
Tell him I'll call back, please.
Sammy, hey, hey.
Where are your priorities?
Come on.
I'll be right back.
So where is Reedsport?
Oh, it's in Oregon, about Well!
A left coaster, huh?
Yeah.
You know, uh, recent medical studies have shown that, uh, time zone transference, aka jet lag, not only can be very upsetting to one's metabolism, but, uh, also directly correlates to the, uh, loss of, uh, hair follicles.
Are you a doctor?
No, he's a floon.
Who is that?
Nobody knows.
So, any last minute fatherly pearls of wisdom?
Read for yourself.
Mmm.
"Dear Sam, would you mind keeping an eye on my Joyce?
"Coach always trusted you.
"She's my little girl, "and she's all alone in the big city.
"If anything ever happened to her, "I'd go into the shed and blow my brains out.
Phyllis says hi".
He writes a nice letter.
Well, that certainly puts the pressure on me.
You?
!
Well, yes.
What do you know about taking care of an 18-year-old in the city of Boston?
A young girl away from home needs a big sister.
Listen, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but she's my responsibility, and I am perfectly capable of handling it.
You know, kids are a lot different than when we were young.
I mean, today they're smart.
You gotta give 'em a lot of room to make their own mistakes.
Yeah, so I hear you're from out of town.
Yeah.
Hey, hey, hey, what-what're you doing there?
I'm just making some polite conversation.
Yeah, well, buddy, this is a bar.
You want to make polite conversation, you take it outside.
Whatever you say.
Do you believe that?
Sam, that wasn't necessary.
I'm not a little girl.
Forget about it.
Come on.
Come on.
Get up here and sit up on my bar here and, uh, tell me.
Well, are you all, uh, you all checked in at college, huh?
Well, uh, not really.
The my dorm is having plumbing troubles, and I have no place to stay.
Well, that's not a problem.
You can stay with me.
I just have to pick up a few things.
A bottle of juice, a loaf of bread.
A door for the bathroom.
My, God, yeah.
Joyce, the only logical place for you to stay is with me.
Oh.
Coach was like a father to me.
Well, I mean, if it's no problem.
Why not?
None at all.
We'll have fun.
It'll be one long slumber party.
Oh, goody.
Can I come over and bring my Frankie Avalon records?
I have dibs on cutting off her hair when she goes to sleep.
Yeah, and if we can get our hands on a laser, we'll try cutting Carla's.
Listen, uh, it'll be a little while before I can get off.
You know what?
Since this is your first day in Boston, I bet you'd love to see some of the sights.
Well, yes, I would.
Good.
Yeah, uh, it's a great idea, but I can't get out of the bar today.
Oh, Sammy, she can come on my route with me, if you want.
No, no.
Uh  Sam?
Sam What?
No problem.
We'll, uh, we'll just find someone else to show her the sights.
All right.
Someone who's enthusiastic.
Someone who's non threatening.
That's good.
That's good.
Somebody, uh, trustworthy.
Somebody, uh, innocent.
Right.
Hey, Sam, you remember that little bird whose wing I mended?
Well, this morning, I was Hey, do you mind?
I'm trying to think here, Woody.
Sam Oh, yeah, right.
Well, hey, do you mind?
I'll handle this.
Woody, come here for a second here, will ya?
You know, I've been thinking long and hard about this, Woody.
Look, there's, uh, somebody I want you to meet here.
Come here.
Joyce, Woody.
Hi.
Wow, what a coincidence.
My first name is Woody.
How would you like to take the rest of the day off and show, uh, Joyce around the town?
Oh, gee, I'd love to.
Well, good.
Take off.
Go on.
Okay, great.
Uh, can we see Old Ironsides first?
Well, I don't know if Raymond Burr lives in Boston.
Well, I'm off.
Fore!
Oh, you get those clubs yet, Fras?
No, but it's just a matter of time.
See, I placed brochures strategically about the house for Lilith to notice.
One nestled under her pillow.
One by the wine rack.
One next to the whip locker.
Hey, Sammy, is Woody out with Joyce again today?
Yeah.
That makes every day this week.
They are so cute together.
You know where he's taking her now?
They're going out for ice cream, and then they're going roller skating.
Oh, those kiddleys, huh?
Well, doesn't that just remind you of your youth?
Not one damn bit.
That's why I feel good about it.
You know, I just think it's a stroke of genius that I had Woody squire Joyce around town.
I mean, she's safe, and I have my peace of mind.
Personally, I'm a little worried about Joyce.
She's been seeing an awful lot of Woody.
So what?
Do you know what time she got in last night?
Who knows what they were up to?
: Oh, come on.
We're talking about Woody.
I mean, the guy is a, is a walking Disney character without the fur.
I think you should talk to them.
There's nothing to talk about.
Hey, I'll talk to her.
No, you won't.
Why not?
Because you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
All right, fine.
I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.
And that's the last you'll hear from me.
Thank you.
Hey, so there you are.
What kind of ice cream did you get?
Tutti-frutti.
Ha-ha!
Tutti-frutti.
Did you hear that?
Yeah, you better be careful 'cause that can lead to the hard stuff-- double chocolate.
So, uh, is he treating you well?
Yeah, yeah, he sure is.
You know, I think he is the sweetest person I've ever met.
: Me, too.
You know, Sam, I am having the best time I've ever had in my life, and I have you to thank for it.
Well, if you're happy, we're happy.
If that makes you happy, you're going to do cartwheels when you hear this.
Joyce and I are engaged.
Hey, uh, Sam?
Are you, are you okay?
Yeah, why?
You're filling your shoes with beer.
Will this be enough for you?
Could you two sit down over at the table there, please?
I'll be right with you.
Just butt out.
Well thank you.
You're welcome.
Soyou're engaged.
Yeah, yeah, and, and we wanted you to be the first one to know about it since you were the one who put us together.
Well, thank you.
Why are you doing this to me?
Well, Sam, we thought this would make you happy.
Well, I am, in a, a sad and disappointed way.
Well, listen, I know it sounds crazy.
We've only known each other a few days, but it seems like several.
Listen, listen, you guys, listen, listen.
I, I was in your shoes once.
I mean, I was young.
I-I, I had a whirlwind romance and I got married and it turned out to be a disaster.
I don't want this to happen to you now.
I mean, look at, look at Diane and me.
We waited five years to get married, and if it were up to me, we'd wait another five.
I'm just trying to make a point.
Do you mind?
The point is, the point is that you got to, you got to, you got to get to know each other better if you're going to take a big step like this.
You got to get past this, this early infatuation and get to the point where you're sick and tired of each other.
Then you're ready for marriage.
Sam, we're never going to be sick of each other.
You know, there, there are hundreds of good, solid reasons why you two should not get married.
Like?
Like like I forbid you to, young lady.
Wait, you can't forbid me.
You're not my father.
All right, all right.
Woody, I forbid you to marry Joyce.
Sam, you're only my boss.
Damn it, I, I'm going to forbid somebody something, I'll tell you.
Norm, I-I forbid you to leave that stool.
Sorry, Sam, uh, nature calls.
Hey, hey, you, whoa, whoa.
You go and you're cut off.
Whatever you say, Pop.
Let's get down to brass tacks here.
How much do you want?
Okay, I'm not a, you know, I'm not a rich guy, but I'm comfortable, so let's stop jerking old Sammy around, and name your price.
Come on.
We don't want anything.
We just want to be together.
Oh, no, don't do Just get into my office, will you?
Come on, both of you.
I've tried to talk to you on an emotional level, a logical level and in an economic level.
Now we're just going to have to raise this whole discussion up to a higher plane.
Have pity on me.
Oh, please don't do this to me, please.
I-I haven't had an easy life.
This is going to hurt me, and I-I don't want to be hurt.
I mean, I-I don't like pain.
And think about your parents.
They hate pain, too.
Not, not as much as me, but pretty much.
Oh, come on, this news'll kill them, you guys.
It'll kill me, too.
I-I please don't, please, come on, don't do this to me!
Don't make me beg.
Oh Gee, Sam, you feel pretty strongly about this?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, maybe he's right, Woody.
Maybe we could get to know each other better.
Really?
It couldn't hurt.
Oh, oh, oh, bless you.
Bless you, kids.
Oh, you, you're the greatest.
Hang in there, buddy.
Oh, oh, thanks, Wood.
Oh heh-heh, they bought it.
See you later, Sam.
Yeah, yeah.
Hey, listen, you know, what you said in there made a lot of sense.
I think you may have stopped us from making a pretty big mistake.
Yes, thank you.
Yeah, my pleasure.
Well, what else can I do around here that I'm great at?
Nauseate us?
Maybe some other time.
Hey, Fras, thought you'd be out on the links by now.
It would be exceedingly difficult to tee off with this.
What's, uh, what's that, Fras?
This is my extra special gift from Lilith.
It's a tie.
Yes, and I hate it.
It's ugly.
It's just a tie.
An ordinary gray tie.
I wanted golf clubs!
It's not special!
I hate it, I hate it, I hate it!
Glad she didn't give him a puppy.
Oh, come, come on, come on.
We're not even married yet.
Oh, Sam.
It's never too early to start thinking about names for our children.
It-It is if you're thinking about the name Emile.
What's wrong with Emile?
Emile is something you eat.
It's not something you name your kid.
Why-Why don't you just name him Socrates, after me?
Ah!
you two kids still basking in the glow of my wisdom?
We sure are.
We thought about what you said, and we decided it was the best advice anyone had ever given us in our lives.
You hear that, Diane?
That's why we've decided to call off the wedding and move in together.
Hear that, Socrates?
Would you two kids go into my office and, and wait for a second?
Sure, Sam.
Thank you.
You know something?
I could handle this, too, if I wanted to.
But I think I'm going to be a good sport about this and, uh, let you take a crack at it.
So, what you're saying is that you screwed up miserably, and now you want me to bail you out.
No!
Of course not.
Absolutely not.
Well, yes.
Yes.
Well, Sam, you don't deserve it, but I'll give it a shot.
Stand aside, Sam.
You're about to see fly into action.
So, you're going to live together.
Why?
Talk to me.
Well, Sam said we should get to know each other better before we got married, and, and we thought this might be the best way.
Mm-hmm.
But I think you've forgotten something.
The reason Joyce came to Boston in the first place.
College.
That was my mom's idea.
I decided I'm not going to college.
Not not going to college?
No.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Oh, no, no.
Oh, you must listen to me.
You You have your whole life ahead of you.
You can't throw it away like this.
If you don't go to college, you can't earn a living.
And, and without a job, what will you do when he leaves you with a litter of kids and, and you have to sell them, one after another, just to put food on your pathetic little table?
And, in the end, you'll be left with nothing.
Nothing but worn-out hips and sagging breasts.
Is that really what you want?
Well, I can't speak for Joyce, but I could do without that.
So, tell me that you'll give up this insane idea of shacking up together and concentrate on your college career.
Well, um I guess I could move into the dorm and try a couple classes.
Yes.
Yeah.
And we could still date and see each other, couldn't we?
Sure, oh, sure, sure.
Dating's good.
Dating's fine.
Yeah.
Sure, I like that idea.
Well, thanks, Miss Chambers.
Okay.
Yes, thank you.
Aw Thank you.
How'd it go?
Oh, well, suffice it to say, the Chambers expertise worked its magic.
You begged, huh?
How do you know?
Your nylons are all baggy there.
How about you?
I don't wear nylons.
I mean, how did you talk them out of getting married?
Me?
I begged like a dog for a bone.
Oh, Sam Mm.
Well, how can we avoid having this problem with our own children?
Never have sex again.
I think it's worth it.
Me, too.
Absolutely.
Yeah, yeah It's worth it.
Absolutely.
Well, may maybe just
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
You missing something, Woody?
Yeah, well, I had a $20 bill in my pocket and now it's gone.
Well, say good-bye to that Andy Jackson.
Oh, see you later, Andy.
Boy, oh, boy.
Talk about your lucky days, huh?
Just found 20 smackers back there in the pool room.
Yeah, and to celebrate my good fortune, I'm gonna buy a round of drinks for all my, uh, friends.
What are you gonna do with the other 19 bucks?
Woody, that could be your $20 bill.
The one you lost.
Hey, yeah, you know, I was in the pool room earlier.
Wait a second.
Now let's be fair about this.
Uh, give me the serial number.
Oh, come on, man.
Nobody knows serial numbers.
L-2-1-8-8-6-1-1-9-B That's amazing.
How'd you do that?
Oh, I memorize the serial numbers on all my currency.
Why?
For just such an occasion.
Tell you, though, I pray everyday I don't get rich.
Making your way in the world today Takes everything you've got Taking a break from all your worries Sure would help a lot Wouldn't you like to get away Sometimes you want to go Where everybody knows your name And they're always glad you came You want to be where you can see Our troubles are all the same You want to be where everybody knows your name You want to go where people know People are all the same You want to go where everybody knows your name.
Oh, groom.
Hmm?
Sweetheart, we're going to have to decide where we're going for our honeymoon.
Where do you want to go?
Boy, I don't know.
Where, where, where do you want to go?
I told you where I want to go-- Tibet.
Well, it's our honeymoon.
Of course we're going to bed.
No, you whammo.
Tibet the country.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Sam, imagine getting up in the morning and looking out on the roof of the world.
Look where we'd stay.
Isn't it quaint?
Looks like where the dogs sleep.
It is.
The dogs sleep with us.
You wouldn't want to freeze to death, would you?
Diane, I didn't sleep with dogs when I was single.
I'm not about to start now.
For goodness sake, don't you want to taste the exciting and fascinating things that life has to offer?
No.
I'd rather marry you.
Afternoon, everybody.
Norm!
Hey, Mr. Peterson, what do you say to a cold one?
"See ya later, Vera, I'll be at Cheers".
You're looking unusually chipper today.
Yeah, I'm feeling kind of chipper, Fras.
Is there any particular reason, other than the fact that we live in a democracy and sushi bars appear to be on the decline?
Well, I was gonna tell Vera first, but why break tradition?
I just landed a great new job at Masters and Holly and Dixon.
Oh, wonderful!
It's one of the top C.P.A. firms in Boston.
Yes, I hear that's quite a successful firm.
You know, over half of their executives require therapy on a regular basis.
So, uh, here's my card.
Oh, great.
Just in case.
Thank you.
It's a very impressive place.
Uh, they occupy the entire 25th floor of the Boston Towers.
And they hired you?
It must have been the altitude.
No, no, no, no, seriously, Norm, I'm sorry.
You know, I hope this works out to be, you know, sort of a long-term arrangement for you.
Long enough anyway for them to see you wear your other suit.
Very funny.
Very funny, you guys.
But I'll have you know they gave me the key to the executive washroom this morning.
Did it come with a bucket and mop?
Laugh all you want, okay, but I think this is finally the job for me.
I've got a secretary.
I have an expense account, a very ritzy office all to myself, so Good for you, Norman.
How about a round of applause for our new executive?
Well, I started late.
I didn't want to be impolite.
I'm really excited for you, Norman.
Thanks.
I can tell by the way you're talking that this is the job that's going to fire your enthusiasm.
When do you start?
About, uh, three hours ago.
What are you doing here?
I didn't want to appear over-anxious, you know.
Yeah, no danger there, huh, Buddy?
No, no, I'm on my lunch hour.
Oh.
But, you know, I could be late if I wanted to.
I mean, I got free rein over there.
I happen to be my own boss.
So that's how you got the job.
Thanks for the send-off, guys.
Well, I hope you're all proud of yourselves.
Why?
What'd we do?
Well, I think we could have been a bit more thunderous in our applause.
Uh, except for Woody.
Sam, didn't you see the hurt in Norman's eyes?
He was seeking our support and approval.
It's his first day on the job and all we did was give him jibes.
Don't worry about it, sweetheart.
He's had hundreds of first days on the job.
You know, Diane's right.
It's obvious how much we mean to him.
I think we may have let him down.
Oh Gee, I hope not.
Yeah, me, too.
Oh, too late to do anything about that now.
Refill, huh, Sam?
Hey, it's not too late.
We could march en masse down to Norman's office and show him that we're in his corner.
Oh, sure.
Perhaps buy the new hotshot a little office warming gift.
Maybe a potted plant.
Good!
Okay, hurry up.
Let's get going here.
Wonderful, Carla.
That's the kind of enthusiasm that's going to make Norman feel better.
The hell with that yutz.
I wanna go downtown and see some Yuppie buns in tight Italian suits.
Well, then it's settled.
We'll go.
Wish I could join you, but I've got an appointment at 1:00.
Oh, what the hell?
Mrs. Segal's rather a compulsive cleaner.
If I'm a little late, maybe she'll tidy up the office.
Give my best to Norm.
Well, aren't you coming?
Oh, I gotta take care of the bar here.
Oh, Sam, we've got to show Norman our impressive phalanx.
Oh, that's all right, honey.
He saw mine at the gym.
And then there was this 1938 accident where the elevator plunged 86 floors.
Get me out of this thing!
Oh, my.
What an exquisite place to come to work everyday.
Have you ever seen such sumptuous surroundings?
Well, you obviously haven't been to the, uh, new downtown postal annex, Diane.
So, uh, where's Woody?
I hope he's not lost.
Gee, what are the odds?
Damn.
Got another one of those carpet shocks.
Well, Carla, if you'd walk like a lady, that wouldn't happen.
If I walked like a lady, nothing would happen.
Sorry I'm late.
Ah, Woody, uh, couldn't you find a bigger one?
No.
You know, at the risk of sounding self-congratulatory, I think we're fabulous.
Just think how Norman will appreciate this.
You know, I remember the first day I worked at The Third Eye Bookstore.
Ramu was explaining to me the difference between I think it was between psychic and occult.
Ouch!
Think we could get this carpet for the bar?
All right.
Everyone ready?
Surprise!
Don't you guys ever think about maybe calling first?
Yeah, well, we couldn't find a phone booth.
Until now.
Say, did anybody ever see Das Boot?
What're you guys doing here?
Well, we wanted to come down and celebrate your first day on the new job.
Yeah, we brought you a gift.
Uh, let me find the perfect spot for this.
There.
Don't forget to water it.
Thanks, I'll write myself a note, Woody.
So, guys, I, uh guess I probably exaggerated a little bit about the office.
But, uh, you know, it's just 'cause you were razzing me so much, and it's actually quite a big step to have an office at all.
I mean, many people in this firm have to share an office.
Oh, just a sec.
Sorry.
Yeah?
Just, uh, set it right here, that's fine.
Let me guess.
Peterson.
Right.
I'm Thompkins.
Looks like we're office partners.
So if you're lookin' for a secretary, I'm available.
But I want you to know I do not take shorthand, I don't type and I don't make coffee.
Well, what do you do?
Hire me and find out.
Carla, I don't think he caught that.
Next time try to be more obvious.
Okay, let's let Norman get back to work.
Thanks.
Oh, Norman, keep up the spirits, huh?
Remember-- no small offices, only small people.
That's right, right.
Okay oh, my God, look at the time.
If I don't get back right now, Mrs. Segal will be shampooing the rug.
Well, okay.
Thanks, thanks a lot for the plant.
Wait, wait, my supervisor.
Everybody hide.
Peterson.
Hi, sir.
What are all these people doing in here?
Well, they're new clients, sir, and, uh, we were just holding a little impromptu seminar on the tax laws, and, uh So in conclusion, folks, I'd like you to, uh, file early and, um file out.
Right, fine.
Thank you, Mr. Peterson.
Thank you.
New clients, sir, so You're, uh, you're Thompkins, aren't you?
Yes, sir.
Yes, well, welcome aboard.
Pay attention.
You can learn a lot from this man.
Thank you, sir.
That's very kind of you to say.
No, I was talking to you.
By the way, sir, I understand you're a big Red Sox fan.
Yeah.
You know, my father has season tickets, uh, right behind the dugout.
No kidding?
Yeah, you know, I'm, I'm usually so busy with work here, I, I rarely get to use them.
Thompkins, let's have lunch.
Thank you.
Oh, that's a, wait.
That's a, uh, lovely tie you've got there, sir.
What, this ugly thing?
Yeah.
Oh, my wife bought it.
Yeah, how is the missus?
We're divorcing.
Well, I hope you stick it to her, sir.
I just wanted to make sure you're okay.
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm great.
Top of the world, ma!
Hey, the first day at a new job is always traumatic.
Look at me.
I'm pushing 40, practically starting over again.
Oh, Norman, that's not true.
Yes, it is.
Yeah?
Yeah, I'm delivering supplies to the supply room.
This isn't the supply room.
Sorry.
Well, it's 2511, right?
Right.
Then it's the supply room.
Well, it may have been the supply room once, okay, but now it's my office.
What does it say on this invoice?
Thank you.
See what I mean, Diane?
I just wasn't meant to be a success.
Norman, may I speak to you for a moment?
You make me sick.
You're a quitter, Norman.
No, you're worse than that.
You're a non-starter.
You don't even try.
You sit around the bar all day.
You sit around your house all day.
You sit around here all day.
You sit around life all day.
How are you gonna feel some day at the end of your life when you're lying, no, make that sitting, on your deathbed and you realize that the only thing you've done in your life is sit around and watch people do things, make things out of their lives.
Well, maybe you're right, Norman.
Maybe you're not meant for success.
Maybe you're meant for exactly what you are.
Nothing.
Diane, you have no right to say that to me.
Norman, I said those things to you because I care.
You must care an awful lot about me.
Well, I do.
All of your friends care about you an awful lot.
And we're tired of seeing you give up so easily.
Maybe I won't give up so easily this time.
Maybe those harsh, stinging, offensive words of yours, words that I'll take to my grave, by the way maybe they finally struck a cord with me, Diane.
Oh, Norman, do you mean it?
Oh, yes, I do, Diane.
You know, every place I've worked, my name has been synonymous with patsy.
Well, I think it's high time my name stood for ruthless.
Now people may not like the new me, but they're gonna respect the new me.
Diane, I want you to mark this date on your calendar, for today is the day the new me is born.
Happy birthday.
Sign here.
Uh-uh.
I'm gonna tell the boss.
No, no, Norman, Norman, Norman Thank you, Mr. Springsteen.
Well, it's a start.
Yeah.
You know, I was thinking while you were gone, it's not really fair to have you make all the honeymoon plans, so I went ahead and I did them myself.
All you have to do is pack your bags and set your dial for fun.
Oh, God, it's Niagara Falls, isn't it?
No, it's not Niagara Falls.
That place is a tourist trap.
You ready for this?
Disneyworld.
You want to go to Disneyworld for our honeymoon?
Oh, yeah.
But, Sam, I always thought that would be someplace we'd go when we have kids.
Well, hey, no, this is not just for kids.
This, this is for "children of all ages".
I mean, can you say the same thing about Tibet?
Well, how can you compare Disneyworld and Tibet where we might possibly unravel the mysteries of life?
Well, there, there are lots of mysteries you can unravel at Disneyworld.
For example?
Um, all right, all right, uh, why is it that, uh, Donald Duck wears a top and no bottom, whereas Mickey wears a bottom and no top?
Oh, Sammy, it-it's because, you know, uh, a duck's private's are hidden by their feathers and mouse's is, uh, well, need I say more?
While you're at it, I mean, why is it we've never seen Donald fly?
I mean, I've seen that damn duck do The Carioca.
Yeah, and if Mickey's dating Minnie, how come he has such a high voice?
Oh, now, whoa, wait, are you trying to tell me that Mickey All right, all right, all right, we'll go!
We'll go!
Evening, everybody.
Norm!
Norman.
Well, look at you.
You look like the cat that swallowed the canary.
Give me a beer to wash him down.
Hey, you're, uh, you're in kinda late there, me bucko.
So how was your first day?
Well, I tell you, I feel a lot better now than I did this morning.
Diane, I took your advice and I spent the afternoon jotting down some ideas I think'll save the company a lot of money.
Oh, Norman!
That's wonderful!
I'm gonna pitch it to my supervisor tomorrow.
But, I tell you, I'm a little nervous about putting my butt on the line.
How do you think the line feels?
Norman why waste time with the supervisor?
He'll only take credit for the idea himself.
Why don't you go right to the top?
Present your idea to the Board of Directors.
I don't know, the thought of standing there in a room full of bigwigs just gives me the cold sweats.
Boy, yeah, I can sympathize with you there, Normie.
Yeah?
Yeah, I'll never forget my first oral report.
Sixth grade.
Yeah?
Yeah, boy, was I nervous.
I tell you.
I went to my father and he said, "Hey, just relax.
"You'll be fine as long as you can imagine the other kids in their underwear".
Which was no big deal for me because I'd gotten that far with half the girls in class already.
Even then, huh?
Yeah, anyway, I was, uh, just describing how they make maple syrup by draining the sap from trees when I happened to look down and notice how nicely Cindy Van Rippen had filled out.
Ooh.
Oh, yes.
Ha-ha.
Well, what happened next?
Oh, well, I, uh, I smiled at her and she smiled at me and then after my little speech we stole a few moments in the cloakroom.
No, I mean after they drain the sap from the trees.
I don't remember, Woody.
Oh, great, Sam.
Get us all revved up and then leave out the best part.
Norman, nothing takes the place of personal support.
Therefore, when you're ready to make your proposal, I will be at your side.
Tell them that you've hired a personal secretary to assist you, at your expense.
Diane, please, I mean, you've been more than helpful already, okay?
I don't need anyone to hold my hand.
I just need a little practice.
Well, uh, Normie, well, why don't you, uh, try it out on us, huh?
That's a good idea actually.
Oh, yes, it is good.
Good, good.
Stand up here so we can all see you.
All right.
Uh, now remember, guys, uh, this room'll be a pressure cooker, so just, uh, you know, stay on top of me, okay?
Really heckle me.
It'll help.
Good morning, gentlemen.
Uh, what's good about it?
What time can you be there?
enjoy a 58% growth.
Cash flow.
And we'll achieve it no later Thank God.
Thank God you're here.
Norman, don't worry, please.
Everything is going to be perfect.
I hope so.
I'm, uh, having a very tough time picturing the chairman of the board in his underpants.
Oh, no.
What?
Now what?
What?
Oh, Pierre forgot the chocolate croissant I ordered.
Don't worry about it.
It wasn't that good.
That's a nice suit, Peterson.
They make it in your size?
Pay no attention to him.
Norman is making a proposal today at the board meeting.
Well, he's wasting his time.
Those stuffed shirts don't care about anybody's ideas.
Why don't you just have the courage to wish him well?
Why don't you take a flying leap?
Touche.
Now listen, I don't like to make predictions, but you're going to be in the top echelon of this company someday.
Your idea is so good they can't help but applaud it.
I hope you're right, Diane, but, uh, we have a few minutes now and I just, I wanna splash some water on my face.
Fine, fine, I'll go prepare the coffee.
Okay.
It's a special Viennese blend.
They're bound to be impressed.
Oh, great, great.
For my part I think I'd like to get a second opinion on this pastry, you know what I mean?
Diane!
It's-It's gone!
What's gone?
Well, my proposal and my career.
The pastry!
Oh, no.
If my plan is implemented immediately, we'll enjoy a 58% growth in cash flow.
And we'll achieve it no later than the third quarter of the next fiscal year.
Thompkins.
The thief.
Get in there and defend yourself.
Damn right I will.
Thompkins, you idiot!
You've completely ignored the obvious.
Our resulting tax liability would cost us a fortune.
Uh, actually, sir, it's not my plan.
It's the new guy, Peterson's, you see  Don't try blaming another man for this garbage.
Now stop wasting our time and get back to work.
Just my luck.
I had to share the office with a moron.
Hey, sorry.
I'll give him this, though.
The man knows his pastry.
Oh, geez.
Now, Norman.
Please.
Now don't let this faze you.
You have to keep pushing.
I know that this idea didn't succeed, but others will.
No, no, Diane.
A few moments ago I almost made the biggest mistake of my professional life, okay?
And it was because I was doing something that just wasn't me.
I am not a go-getter.
I've never been a go-getter.
And what's more, I don't even want to be a go-getter.
I'm very happy right where I am.
And I'm tired of all these people saying, "Peterson, you've gotta push.
"You gotta get ahead.
You gotta make that goal".
I don't even wanna make the goal, Diane.
I wanna be a bench warmer, okay?
The world needs bench warmers.
I mean, if there were no bench warmers, what would we have?
We'd have cold benches.
A lot of cold benches.
And the world does not need that, Diane.
In this great pageantry of life, Norm Peterson may be a, a motionless lump, but he's a very damn good one.
Norman, I've never seen you so impassioned.
That's 'cause I believe in this, Diane.
Look, Norm Peterson is totally happy being an anonymous cog in the gigantic machinery of this firm.
Oh, I forgot.
Didn't you wanna say something at the meeting?
Just how delighted I was to be part of the firm, sir.
Well, we're glad to have you aboard, Springsteen.
I'm home.
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
I know, Dad, but still Well, whatever you think is best, Dad.
Right.
Bye, Dad.
That was my dad.
Really.
Yeah, he's threatening to make me move back home to Indiana.
He's been talking to my Uncle Fergie.
The guy who was here last week?
I thought he had a great time.
Well, he did.
But all he told them about was the two times he got mugged.
Oh, that was just bad luck.
Yeah.
Woody, you've lived here two years.
How many times you been mugged?
Ten.
But You know, that's including the two times with Uncle Fergie.
Oh.
So now my parents are convinced that Boston is a dangerous town and all my friends are seedy lowlifes.
Well, surely they don't want you to go back to Indiana because we're a corrupting influence.
Well, who knows?
Somehow, they got the idea that every guy in Boston is some lonely, pathetic weirdo.
Look, is this or is this not the spitting image of George Schultz?
So, uh, Woody, what time does your bus leave?
Making your way in the world today Takes everything you've got Taking a break from all your worries Sure would help a lot Wouldn't you like to get away Sometimes you want to go Where everybody knows your name And they're always glad you came You want to be where you can see Our troubles are all the same You want to be where everybody knows your name Ã¢â¢Âª You want to go where people know Ã¢â¢Âª Ã¢â¢Âª People are all the same Ã¢â¢Âª You want to go where everybody knows your name.
Okay, let's take it again.
Diane, do we really have to do this again?
We all agreed that the best way to persuade Woody's parents to let him stay was to show them how decent and upstanding his friends are, right?
Okay.
And what better way to show them than by making a film of his everyday life?
And who better to serve as auteur than the person who ruined the curve in her film techniques class.
Hey, Diane, shoot the damn film.
Would you tell Fellini "Shoot the damn film"?
Would you tell Antonioni "Shoot the damn film"?
Would you tell Bergman "Shoot the damn film"?
No, I'm telling you, shoot the damn film.
Better yet, shoot the damn Diane.
Please.
A little more reverence for the words I've written.
Stick to the script.
And try to be spontaneous.
Okay.
Take 17, "Man-child in Beantown".
Action!
"You know, when, the average Joe like me gets off work, "he needs to come to a place like this where he can sort of unwind with his surrogate family".
"Took the words right out of my mouth, Norm.
"But it feels as if a, uh, crucial part of our support system is missing".
"You're right.
Uh, what do you think that would be, Carla"?
"Could it be that bucolic ray of sunshine from Indiana"?
Stupid.
This whole thing is stupid, Diane!
People, people, work with me!
Work with me!
I hate that.
I hate "People, people" Please, Sam.
All right, all right.
Um, "You're right.
Woody's not here.
"The place seems so empty without his smiling countenance".
"Hello, buddies".
"Hello, Woody"!
"Come on over and join us for some male bonding".
"Well, that sounds good, but first, I have to call my mother".
"Yeah, it sure is refreshing to see a son "being so considerate of his mother.
Isn't it, Carla"?
It's stupid!
"You know, my lovely and cherished" Fawn-like.
"fawn-like bride-to-be, Diane Chambers" You're right, Carla, this is stupid.
The whole thing is stupid!
I mean, why can't we just use our own words?
Be ourselves here?
Fine, Mr. Smarty Pants.
You're such an expert, you take the camera.
Go ahead.
All right.
All right, I will.
Just don't come crying to me when the whole mise-en-scene deteriorates.
You'll find that film is an exacting art requiring a lot more than just knowing where the "on" button is.
Good luck.
Yeah, well, we don't need any luck.
And we don't need you, either Cinema Puss.
Where is the "on" button on this?
Oh, good, good, good, good.
You're just in time to see our masterpiece.
Should I alert Pauline Kael?
Well, if you want to, but tell her to get her butt in gear, we're about to start.
Cliffie, get the lights there.
Yeah, come on.
This part was my idea.
Look at this.
Startlingly original use of the subjective camera.
No, not really.
They use it in all your finer chain saw movies.
Hi, Mom!
Dad!
What a surprise!
I was hoping you'd get to see where I worked.
Welcome to the best bar in Boston.
Pretty wholesome and unseedy looking, huh?
And here are the best and most uncorrupting friends a guy could hope to have.
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Boyd!
First, I'd like ya to meet my boss and good friend, Sam Malone.
Sam used to be a relief pitcher for the Boston Red Sox.
Now he owns Cheers.
Hi!
This is Sam's office.
And over there, that's Sam.
He's more than just a boss to me.
He's like the big brother I never had.
Well, except for Tom.
Hi, Woody.
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Boyd.
Another good friend, Mr. Norm Peterson, has been kind enough to run the camera for us today.
So, uh, Sam, you're, you're reading the Bible again huh?
Well, yeah, I didn't think I was gonna get caught.
Yes, I was just, uh, enjoying St. Paul's, uh, Epistle to the Galatians.
Boy, those Galatians.
When will they listen, huh?
Woody, uh, what's going on?
Oh, well, I have a little dilemma here, Sam.
My father might call me back home and, uh, if he does-- and I sure hope he doesn't-- what am I gonna do with this?
I mean, after all, what kind of a place is a small farm to raise a puppy?
I was hoping you could take him, Sam.
Well, gee, Woody, I don't have the room.
I guess you'll just have to put the poor little fella to sleep.
Put this poor puppy to sleep because I have to leave Boston?
Well, if that's what my father wants What a shame, Woody.
What kind of dog is it?
What's the difference?
He's gonna die.
Well, maybe your daddy will let you stay here and take care of him.
I'd sure prefer that.
What about you, pooch?
Would you prefer that to dying?
Subtle tug at the old heartstrings there, guys.
: Boy, I'll say.
Hey, shut up, everybody, you're missing my yard.
Hi!
Welcome to our cookout.
Another chicken leg, Mr. Peterson?
Oh, well, nah yeah!
What the hey, it looks pretty good if I do say so myself.
This is my co-worker here, Carla Tortelli.
Hi.
What do we have here?
Uh, this is just the sort of family type thing we do here in Boston.
Hi.
Say something besides "hi".
Hello.
You hear that?
Well, uh, Carla lives near the airport so  actually, sometimes, it's hard to hear.
Why wasn't I invited?
You didn't miss much, Diane.
Carla's kids stole the beef and then they stuck Woody's shoes on the fire.
NORM : More smoked tongue, anyone?
Give me that!
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Boyd.
I'm Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Boyd.
I'm Cliff Clavin, a good pal of Woody's and a proud member of the U.S. Postal Service.
Come on along with me and I'll show you the kind of work we do routinely at the USPS.
CLIFF : Morning, Woody.
Hi, Mr. Clavin.
Hi, Judy!
Well, let's see what we got in the mail bag.
Well, look at this!
It's a letter all the way from Guam to a man right here in Boston.
Wow!
It's made it this far, and it's up to me to see that it gets where it's intended.
Woody, I could get in big trouble for that.
Oh.
I'm only one link in this chain-- a strong link, a vital link A missing link.
Come on in.
Pretty impressive, huh, Woody?
Sure is, Mr. Clavin.
Hey, just think, all these letters traveling thousands of miles over oceans and rough terrain, right into the hands of their, uh, intended addressees.
Hey, why thanks, Woody.
You did that pretty well.
Thanks.
Would, uh, would you like to try one on your own?
Well, gee, Mr. Clavin, I'm not a government employee.
: Pretty good, Woody.
I was just testing him.
Smart boy.
Yeah, Woods, next time you lick a stamp and put it on an envelope, drop it in that old mailbox, be sure to give some thought to, uh, the thousands of men and women in the U.S. Postal Service who work very hard, day after day, to make sure that your mail is delivered safely.
You know, Woods, you'd make a good postal carrier yourself.
Yeah?
You've got, uh, youth, stamina and a friend down at the post office.
Oh, who's that, Mr. Clavin?
But then again, bartending is a noble profession.
But, Woody, you know there's nothing quite like the pride a postman feels on the swift completion of his appointed rounds.
You don't have to worry about me going hungry if I stay here in Boston.
This town is famous for its finer health food restaurants.
Hi.
And the best of them all is the Hungry Heifer.
That's right, Woody.
I found out about this place through a guy who's helped me plan my life here in Boston, a good friend and my financial advisor, Mr. Norm Peterson.
Hi.
Are you hungry?
Norm!
Uh, nice place, huh?
Yeah, normally, for this sort of ambiance, you'd have to travel to Albuquerque.
Hi, Corinne.
Hi, honey.
Studying at the feet of the master?
Huh?
What can I get you, Norm?
The, uh, Feeding Frenzy Special for two.
How about you, honey?
Well, I think he was ordering for both of us.
No.
No.
Oh, well, give me just one.
Anything for you, Sam?
Smart move.
Oh, Corinne, I think you forgot the, uh, French fries.
Don't you wanna save room for dessert?
You're one step ahead of me.
They take care of you here.
Finally I want you to meet my good friend, Dr. Frasier Crane.
Now, I know what you always said about psychiatrists, Dad, but, uh, he's not a crook or a nut case or anything.
He's a pretty smart guy.
Well, here you go, Dr. Crane.
Thank you, Woody.
Mr. and Mrs. Boyd, in Woody, you have raised a young man of singular character, not easily swayed by the attitudes of those around him.
Trust him.
Trust yourselves.
Let him do what he wants to with his life.
Now, let me address some of your reservations about the psychiatric profession.
In this building, you see 18 floors of highly trained, dedicated professionals, whose sole purpose is to heal the mind.
And, you know, I think my mentor Norm, Norm, could you run that back for me, please?
FRASIER : seek to find  you know, I think my mentor I've gotta tell Dr. Judd to keep his windows closed during his depression seminar.
Well, uh, what'd you think?
After seeing that, I think we should all move to Indiana.
I don't know how you guys did it, but you made me out as, uh, some kind of a jerk.
Well, talk about movie magic, huh?
Maybe you're just too close to the subject, huh, Cliff?
No, I thought he looked like a jerk, too.
Yeah, you all look like jerks to me.
Oh May I say something?
Go ahead, go ahead.
Tell me how right you were.
Get it over with.
On the contrary, I was about to say that I don't think any of these people realize what a fine job you did.
Oh, right.
No, I mean that.
What you have here is the raw material for a truly fine film.
Well, thank you.
The problem is entirely with its structure.
It's too linear.
Yeah, that was gnawing at me, too.
We need to make a film that appeals to the emotions, not the intellect.
If you'll allow me, I can transform your film into a shattering emotional experience.
What are you gonna do to it?
Oh, a snip here, a snip there, nothing much.
In a world gone mad, where can a young man go?
Where?
Where?
Tell me where?
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Boyd.
And here are the best and most uncorrupting friends a guy could hope to have.
First, I'd like you to meet my boss and good friend, Sam Malone.
Sam used to be a relief pitcher for the Boston Red Sox.
Uh, this is just the sort of family-type thing we do here in Boston.
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Boyd.
Welcome to our cookout.
Another chicken leg, Mr. Peterson?
Be sure to give some thought to, uh, the thousands of men and women in uniform.
In Woody, you have raised a young man of singular character, not easily swayed by the attitudes of those around him.
Trust him.
Trust yourselves.
Let him do what he wants to with his life.
Shouldn't we all have the chance to live our lives the way we choose?
Please, give us that chance in the time we have left.
Well?
Gee, uh, you know Oh, you're hurt because I was the only one who had a credit at the end.
You keep the credits.
Oh, thanks.
It's just that I felt I transformed your film into a personal statement that was pure Diane Chambers.
It was pure something.
I don't know, Miss Chambers.
Maybe we better not send this film to my folks.
Oh, Woody, it's a fait accompli.
Was it ever.
No, I mean, I've already sent a copy to your father.
For all we know, he may be viewing it as we speak.
Oh, I think that's a mistake.
Why?
Well, your film, uh, didn't have enough well, there, there was too much it needed a little, uh Yeah, and it stunk, too.
Thank you, Siskel and Ebert.
Take my word for it, after Woody's father sees this impassioned plea for individual freedom, there is no way he will be able to order Woody to leave here against his will.
Well, I guess this is good-bye, then.
I just can't believe you're leaving us, Woody.
Are you sure my film had no effect on your father?
Oh, come on, face it.
All that weird stuff wouldn't mean anything to a guy like Mr. Boyd.
Yeah.
Besides, he thought it was too derivative of Godard.
You sure you don't mind if I take this picture, Sam?
No, I want you to have it.
While we're at it, Woody, here.
Oh, one of your Elvis earrings.
Yeah.
Well, he was one of a kind and so are you.
Oh Besides, the guy I went out with last night, he swallowed the other one.
Here.
I want you to have this.
It's a copy of Being and Nothingness.
My mother gave it to me in grade school.
Aw, thanks, Miss Chambers.
I don't think I've read this one.
Woody, uh a six-pack.
All the, uh, beer you've poured me over the years, you know.
Thanks a lot, Mr. Peterson.
So, Woods, uh, I've got a sheet of commemorative stamps here depicting, uh, all the U.S. Presidents, uh, well, except nine.
That's great.
Thank you, Mr. Clavin.
See, I didn't know, I didn't know we were giving gifts.
I could, uh, could I send you something?
Ah, that's fine, Dr. Crane.
It's been an honor knowing you, Woody.
You know, if somebody had told me, I could've picked something up.
Uh I gotta go.
I'll walk you to the car.
No, no, no, I I wanna remember you guys the way you're standing.
Bye, Woody.
Well, hell, we don't have to stand around here forever, do we?
Does anybody know his shirt size?
Come on, let me buy you all a beer on the house, here.
No, none for me, Sammy.
Hello, Cheers.
Beer's just gonna remind me of the kid.
It'll be quite some time before I can even touch one again.
Well, that oughta do it, I guess.
Hey, hey, it's Woody's dad.
Get him!
Get him!
Oh, oh!
Woody!
Woody, your father's on the phone.
Hey, guys, how you been?
Hello?
Dad?
Really?
Oh, well, thank you.
Thank you.
You don't know how happy this makes me.
Yeah, I love you, too.
Bye!
Oh, I can stay!
Oh, Woody!
Yeah, after reflecting on my film, he was finally moved by its timeless message.
No, he tossed it in the thresher.
Well, what, what happened, Woody?
Someone sent him a real simple note that changed his mind.
What did it say?
It said, "Let your son choose his own path and it will always lead back to you".
Oh, how eloquent.
Yeah, but it wasn't signed.
Hey, come on, guys, fess up.
Who did it?
Oh, not me.
No.
Don't look at me.
Carla?
Yeah, right.
I sure wish I knew who it was, so I could thank them.
Don't mention it, kid.
{END OF EPISODE 24}{START OF EPISODE 25}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
Guinness stout and a gin and tonic.
Something the matter, Carla?
Yeah, something's the matter.
My life is the pits.
Seems like good things happen to everybody except me, you know?
Norm has a new job.
Frasier actually seems happy since he met his creepy girlfriend.
And Sam has given up women and decided to marry Diane.
And what have I got?
Zip.
Woody, I mean, how do you keep such a sunny disposition in this rotten, stink-infested world?
You mean, what do I do when I see Mr. Blues peeking around the corner?
Oh, God, he even has a cute name for depression.
Well, I just close my eyes, and I think a happy thought.
Here, I-I'll show you.
What was your thought?
I'm glad I'm not you.
Making your way in the world today Takes everything you've got Taking a break from all your worries Sure would help a lot Wouldn't you like to get away Sometimes you want to go Where everybody knows your name And they're always glad you came You want to be where you can see Our troubles are all the same You want to be where everybody knows your name You want to go where people know People are all the same You want to go where everybody knows your name.
Hey, Mr. Peterson.
Yeah.
I'm working on this month's issue of the Cheers newsletter, and I wondered what's new with you?
Nothing, really, Woody.
Well, you sure?
Uh, I don't know.
Check last month.
What was I up to then?
Let's see.
Norm Peterson.
Nothing.
Oh.
Well, I guess it's not new then, eh?
How about you, Dr. Crane?
What's new in my life?
Well, it's not easily put into words, Wood.
Perhaps it has something to do with my relationship with Lilith.
And perhaps it's just a maturity that comes with age.
All I know is that I feel I finally know who I am, and I'm happy with that person.
Does that answer your question?
Sure does.
Dr. Crane: Nothing.
Sam!
Great news!
I found a house.
Hey!
Turn it in.
Maybe you'll get a reward.
No, you goose.
I found our house.
I was driving to work today and, as luck would have it, there was an eight-car smash-up.
Yeah, that didn't come out right.
What I meant was I was forced to take an alternate route, and it sent me right past the perfect house.
Oh, Sam, you should see it.
Three bedrooms, two and a half baths, a formal dining room, a huge fireplace in the living room.
Excuse me for interrupting, but we're not looking for a house.
I know.
I already found it.
No, I mean that we agreed to live in my apartment for a year first.
Well, yes, that was the original plan.
Yeah.
But that was before I saw hardwood floors, bay windows, crown moldings.
Yeah, well, so what's wrong with my apartment?
Well, granted this house doesn't have your view of the Exotic Dancing Academy.
But I think you could learn to live in the shade of a stately elm.
Oh, uh, I, uh, hate to be a buttinsky here, but, uh, this is the absolute worst time to buy a house.
Why is that?
Ah, seller's market.
Unless you run into that, uh, rare breed, you know, the motivated seller.
Now, you know, for a price, I could put you in a sweet little, uh, three-bed, two-bath number.
Uh, it's got, uh, fishnetting over the patio and a handmade, uh, uh, lava rock fire pit in the back.
Cliffie, uh, that sounds a little bit like your house.
It is my house, Norm.
Wait, wait, wait now.
You said your mother was going to live there till the day she died.
Well, uh, she's clean, and she doesn't eat much.
Sam, please.
Just come with me and take a look at it.
I'm not-I'm not ready to own a home.
It's a you-you got to work up to that.
Sammy's right.
It's a big responsibility.
You got uh, lawns to mow.
You got plumbing to fix.
You got gutters to clean.
Then, you know, every couple of years, you got to paint the entire thing from top to bottom.
Honestly, I don't know where Vera gets the energy sometimes.
Norm, you should be ashamed of yourself.
Yeah, I guess I should, shouldn't I?
You know, thank God I'm not, huh?
Well, Sam and I will split the chores at our house.
Would you just slow down?
We're not buyin' a house.
I mean it.
Now, Sam, don't be so hasty.
This could be the house for you.
Does it have a basement?
Yes, it does.
A large one.
Great.
You can convert it into a dungeon to keep Diane in.
Then, when you're done torturing her, you could bury the body under the cement floor, cover it with a Ping-Pong table.
Well, maybe.
I don't know.
Sam.
No, no, maybe you, not her.
Will you stop stalling and come with me, please?
Just give me one good reason why I should.
Because we own it.
That's a pretty good reason, Sam.
You bought a house without asking me?
Well, I-I didn't exactly buy it.
Uh-huh.
I put down the teeniest of refundable deposits.
You know, I don't believe this.
Oh, now, Sam, there was another couple there, and they were all ready to make a bid on it.
I had to move quickly.
Yeah, talking about moving quickly, you get into my office right now and you call them tell them that I want my deposit back.
Okay, Sam, whatever you say.
But first I want to call the decorator about ordering drapes.
Yeah, well, make it quick.
Well, I guess it's time we started thinking about a housewarming gift.
Ah, it's pathetic.
Yeah, you'd never catch a woman of mine leading me around by the nose.
No, but you might catch her sunning herself on a rock.
It's ours.
It's finally ours.
I can't believe it.
Neither can I. Wow, you know, every time I come here I like this place more and more.
Oh.
Thank God you talked me into this.
Oh, yeah.
Oh.
You don't think we spent too much money on it?
Oh, absolutely.
What the hell?
It's a great house.
Yeah.
And it's ours.
Well, not quite yet.
You know, I never feel at home until I hang this little baby up.
Oh, God, Sam.
What?
Oh, not where people can see it.
You know, I have never understood your attitude about this painting.
I mean, it's a classic.
"Dogs Playing Blackjack".
I never look at this without cracking up.
Ah.
Well, that's the purpose of great art.
You know something?
I think you, you're missing the subtle humor here.
I mean, see this guy right here?
He's cheating.
Oh.
Oh, Sam, I can hardly wait till I'm in the kitchen, pot holders in hand, cooking a nice big roast, calling out to you, "Dinner's ready, honey".
"I'll be right there.
I'm in the workshop".
The workshop?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
My dad always had one.
I used to go down there all the time.
I just loved the smell of sawdust.
Wonder where I can buy some of that.
Oh, Sam, I have wonderful plans for every room in the entire house.
That's funny, so do I.  Why don't we start right here in the living room?
Yeah, these floors look like they could use a little polishing.
Oh, Sam.
Sam.
We really have to leave now, my dear.
Yes, I guess you're right.
Uh, hello?
Hello?
Oh.
You must be the new owner.
Yeah, yeah, I'm, uh, I'm Sam Malone.
How do you do?
How are you?
This is my, uh, fiancÃ©e, Diane Chambers.
Hi.
Bert and Lillian Miller.
Oh.
Hi, how are you?
Pleased to meet you.
Oh, it's a pleasure.
The house is beautiful.
Mmm.
Oh, yes, yes.
Well, of course, we know we're supposed to be out of here by now, but, well, we forgot a few odds and ends, you know?
And, uh, well, we just wanted to take a last look.
Well, you know, when you've lived in a house for 40 years, taking that last step out the door, well, it-it-it's pretty hard.
Of course.
I confess, I touched liquor this morning.
Oh, tha that's all right, my girl.
But you look like a fine couple.
I'm glad the house is going to you.
Thank you.
Oh, yeah, yeah, we plan to do great things in it-- with it, with it.
So many memories.
Like when Mikey climbed up the bookshelves and hit his head on the mantle.
You remember?
Oh, we were all so worried.
And that's where little Janey rehearsed her dance for the school play.
Oh.
You know, I studied ballet as a child.
So I became quite experien Berty Junior took his first steps on this very spot right here.
And that's where we always put our Christmas tree.
Every year.
Thirty-nine.
Hmm?
Well, we didn't quite make it to Christmas this year.
Oh, sure.
You know, I think we'll miss the Christmases most of all.
I know, Bert.
The children and the grandchildren.
Ah, never mind.
There, there now.
Out with the old.
And in with the new.
Now, we're just going to get out of your way, so that you two can share your lives.
Well, good luck to you.
Thank you.
Can I help you with those boxes there?
Oh no, they'll be fine.
No.
We're just going as far as the bus stop.
Okay, okay.
Have a nice day.
Yeah.
Glad to meet you.
Thank you.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
: Good-bye, house.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye now.
Gee, what a sweet couple, huh?
Let's see, where were we?
Oh, yes, yes, yes, I think we were, uh, talking about polishing the floor.
Do want to wax or shall we buff?
I cannot live a single day in this house.
Oh, God.
Come on, come on.
It's all right.
I mean it, Sam.
I could never live here.
No, don't say that.
Don't say that.
Listen, hey, I got a surprise for you.
Look, I took the picture down.
Sam, it has nothing to do with the picture.
I-I Although I do appreciate that.
This place belongs to Bert and Lillian.
It's alive with their memories.
Oh, poor Mikey.
Now, that must have smarted.
Come on, come on, we love this house.
Now, I know how you feel right now, but but wait till we make some changes here.
Look, we can we can we can knock out this wall right here and make the whole room different.
I mean, yeah, what the hell?
Look at that.
They got writing all over this wall.
Oh, look.
"Mikey at one year, 30 inches".
"Bert Jr. at two years, 36 inches".
How can you possibly think of tearing this down?
Can't you see this is a record of their lives?
Well, all I can see is that little Janey here was a moose.
How'd you like to have that coming at you in a tutu, huh?
You have the sensitivity of a dung beetle.
I'm just trying to lighten the mood up here.
Well, I'm not in the mood for fun and games.
Well  Happy housewarming!
Hey, hey No, don't.
This isn't our house.
We don't belong in it.
I'll never live here.
Not one day, not one minute.
Please, leave, please.
You know, Sammy, a couple of years ago, this might've taken me by surprise, but now I just kind of roll with it.
This is great!
I got the one where they're on the train.
Yeah.
Not now, Woody.
Look at that.
I never noticed that.
The bloodhound's doubling down.
Look at that.
Uh, I'm sorry about this, you guys.
It's a it's a bad time.
Wait till the honeymoon!
We're trespassers here, Sam.
The love and warmth that fill these walls didn't come from us.
We can change the wallpaper, we can paint, we can put up new curtains, but the soul of this house will still be those two sweet, old people.
I'd be afraid to wash the dishes for fear I'd turn the faucet on, and instead of water coming out, it would be Lillian's tears.
Oh, brother.
I-I-I'll put a purifier in.
All houses have ghosts.
You know, memories of people who lived there before.
Now, the only way you can get rid of them is to-to start making your own memories, and the only way we can do that is if we move in here and start living here.
Mm maybe you're right.
Yeah.
I guess I've been overreacting.
Oh, that's okay.
What do you say we carry on this conversation naked?
Do you think I could ever make love in this house?
Afternoon, everybody.
Norm!
Hey, Mr. Peterson, how's life?
Oh, the plot's okay, Woody, but it kind of falls apart at the end.
Where's Sammy and Diane?
They're in the office trying to unload The Nightmare on Diane Street.
Well they'll just have to miss my big news.
Woody, I want you to stop the presses on that, uh, newsletter.
You'll never guess who I saw in front of my office today.
Robert Urich.
Okay?
I want to tell you he's just as nice a guy driving past at 50 miles an hour as he looks on that TV screen.
Hey, Woody, Woody, Woody.
Another round.
Quick, too.
Hey, how's it going in there?
Oh, great.
The couple in there are crazier about the house than we were.
You know, I have to admit, I was a little ticked off when Diane said she wanted to sell the house, but as it turns out, I think we're going to make a-- that's good, Woody-- make a nice little profit here.
Are you sure I can't change your mind?
I'm sorry.
That's my final decision.
You know, I-I-I'm getting on in years, and my hearing may not be what it used to be, but did you just queer this whole deal?
I had to turn them down.
Why?
Sam, those people were bereft of soul.
They had no intention of embracing that house.
Their only desire was to live there.
They wanted to live in the house they just bought?
My God, they must've been raised by wolves.
They weren't the right kind of people to live in Bert and Lillian's house.
Oh, you know That's it, that's it.
You know, I we have always done things your way.
I have bent over backwards to make you happy.
I bought the ring you wanted, the china you wanted, the-the crystal you wanted.
I even agreed to have a duvet cover on my bed, and I don't know what a duvet is or what it's supposed to cover.
When are we going to do something that I want to do?
May I remind you that we're going to Disney World for our honeymoon?
Big deal.
Who isn't?
Sam, every time I look at that place, I can't help but think about that poor, old couple, shambling away from their house, wishing they could spend one last Christmas there with their family.
Well, then why not just give them one last Christmas there, if that's what they want?
But rid yourself of the guilt you feel by robbing them of the last few happy memories left them.
Oh, you know, that-that's the screwiest idea I've ever heard.
No, Sam, he's right.
We-we'll-we'll call the Millers and all their children, and we'll plan a Christmas party.
Oh, Sam, it'll make the transition easier for them and for me.
Well, what are we supposed to do until December?
Bunk out with Ma Clavin?
No, I mean, we'll do it now.
This year, Christmas comes next week.
Oh Huh?
Oh, it'll be fun.
Oh, gee, I hate it when they change holidays around just to make a three-day weekend.
Who's ready for some delicious hot apple cider?
Can I have mine with ice?
It's 80 degrees outside.
Where's your Christmas spirit, Naomi?
It melted.
There's another present for you there, Naomi.
Isn't that right, Santa?
I'm looking, I'm looking, I'm looking.
All right, here it is, here it is.
There you go, kid.
There you are.
Oh, boy!
What do you say, Naomi?
Thank you, Santa.
Ah And what do you say, Santa?
Yeah, Mrs. Claus is going to pay for this.
Come here.
Look, look, how much longer do we have to do this?
Oh, the children are loving it.
Yeah, well, can I at least take this beard off?
No, no, no, no.
Now, we don't want to spoil their illusions.
Don't you think the fact that Santa's here in mid-May sweating bullets is making 'em a little suspicious already?
Uh, yes, Santa, what a great idea.
Why don't you lead us all in some Christmas carols?
Uh, m-m-maybe somebody else ought to do that.
Uh, Santa's got a little summer cold going here.
Oh, well, David is the musician of the family.
Well "Let it Snow" in "E" flat.
Oh, the weather outside is frightful But the fire is so delightful And since there's no place to go Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow All right, all right, look, we-we did it, we did it.
They're singing their carols.
We passed out the presents.
Now can we put out the stupid fire and-and get the Millers out of here, please?
Oh, but, Sam, we haven't roasted the chestnuts yet.
Oh, guess again, sweetheart.
Well, you know, that was great, kids, but I think perhaps we-we ought to thank the kind and generous friends who've let us make this Yuletide possible.
Oh, no.
No, no.
You really don't have to.
No, no, not at all.
Now, Sam and Diane have opened their home-- it is their home now-- so that we can enjoy one last Christmas here together.
Well, of course, we've known a lot of Christmases around this hearth, but for you kids, this will be the last one.
And all they'll have is pictures, home movies and memories to fill the gap through their lives.
Oh, I hope the memories survive.
Say you'll remember, children.
We'll all remember, Grandma.
Yes, and-and what about Easter?
Will you remember the Easters, too?
I don't remember, Grandpa.
Oh, honey Please don't make Grandma and Grandpa leave, lady.
No, go Oh, oh, th-th-they don't have to.
Listen, why don't you come over next week, and we'll have a big Easter egg hunt right here.
And I will make it an annual occasion.
Yay!
No, no, no, no!
No, no, I am not putting on a bunny suit for anybody!
Now, now, listen, we've done everything-- more than everything-- anybody could possibly expect.
We got to draw the line somewhere here.
I mean, we can't arrange our lives just for you people.
I mean, this is our house now.
Y-Y-You can't have it anymore.
Please, I mean, w-we-we need a chance to start our own lives here.
I mean, for God's sake, we haven't even had a chance to be intimate in our own home yet.
What does Santa mean, Mommy?
Mommy will explain it later, dear.
Yeah, and somewhere else, Mommy.
Uh, c-come on, everybody, please, out.
Oh, no, no, no.
Now, don't grumble.
Santa is right.
He may have been a little rude about it but it is true.
We have been imposing.
So let's all go over to Grandma and Grandpa's new condo and have Christmas there.
Yay!
Frosty the Snowman was a jolly, happy soul Bye-bye, happy holidays.
?
With a corncob pipe and button nose ?
Yeah, bye-bye, bye-bye.
?
And two eyes made out of coal ?
There we go.
Bye-bye.
Thank you.
There we go.
What about our presents?
Uh, we'll ship 'em to you.
I can't believe what you just did, Sam.
I am not going to apologize, Diane.
Suddenly, the house is ours.
You mean that?
You claimed it for me.
Oh.
Just stood up and claimed it for me like some animal out of the wild.
Oh, Sam you're so sexy when you're territorial.
So, uh anything special you want from Santa this year, little girl?
Oh, Santa Well, I think that can be arranged.
There you go Where is that?
It's in there someplace.
You know, Santa?
Hmm?
I think it's time to take you up on that offer to polish the floor.
Oh, well, uh what room would you like to start in here?
Hmm how about the dining room?
Oh, good, good, good, good, good.
{END OF EPISODE 25}{START OF EPISODE 26}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
Sammy, got three questions.
One, who's going to fix the ball return on the pool table?
Okay, I'll check that today.
Check.
Two, how much vermouth do you want next month?
Uh, an extra case.
Check.
Three, why, why, why?
!
Oh, come on, don't start with me about the wedding, will you?
Oh, Sammy-- Sam, it actually looks like you're going to go through with this horrible thing.
Why do you want to marry this woman?
I don't know, Carla.
It It's not easy to explain.
I mean, why did you marry Nick?
Why?
!
'Cause I was stupid, that's why.
Well actually, there was a little more.
What?
You tell anybody this, and I'll kill you.
: No, I won't.
Nick made me feel all : all squooshy inside.
"Squooshy"?
Squooshy.
Uh, well that's how Diane makes me feel-- all squooshy.
: Oh, yuck!
Double yuck!
Oh, I'm gonna throw up!
This is so disgusting!
You said it.
What do y?
I married Nick 'cause he knocked me up.
This is sickening!
Ugh!
I only said it 'cause you said it.
What are you do?
I need some air.
Hey, guys, listen to this!
No, don't, please don't!
Sam says Diane makes him feel all squooshy!
Ooh, Sammy!
"Squooshy".
Oh!
Sometimes you want to go Where everybody knows your name And they're always glad you came You want to be where you can see Our troubles are all the same You want to go where everybody knows your name.
Excuse me, young man.
I'm Dr. Sumner Sloane.
I'm looking for Diane Chambers.
Gee, I hope she's not sick.
No, I'm not a medical doctor.
I'm in the Literature Department at Boston University where I occupy a chair.
Huh.
Hey, don't worry about it.
That's all I did in school, too.
Hey, that's Sumner Sloane there.
The famous Sumner Sloane-- the man who jilted Diane?
Yup.
He made a bigger doofus out of her than she made out of you.
No easy trick.
Oh, boy, yeah, that was one of your major league dumps, too.
Poor little Diane, left there on our doorstep, you know, turning to us for, uh, shelter from life's storm.
Boy, oh, boy, it seems like a long time ago, doesn't it, Normie?
Yep.
A lot's changed since that fateful night, eh?
Yeah.
As I recall, you were sitting over there, drinking a beer, and I was sitting right here having a beer, kind of wishing you'd shut up.
Good memory.
Yeah.
Hello, Diane.
Hello, Sumner.
Hello, Sam, old man.
Sumner.
I understand congratulations are in order.
You've heard about our engagement?
Yes.
Wonderful news travels fast.
Sam, old man, I'd like to steal away your lovely bride-to-be for a private chat.
With your permission, of course.
You're not going to try to take her away from me, are you, Sumner?
It's obvious you've cast a spell over Diane that someone with even my considerable charms would find difficult to break.
Well, maybe with your charms and a jug of cheap wine.
Hello, I'm Dr. Frasier Crane.
Perhaps you've heard of me.
Not till this moment.
Well, it just so happens that I was once engaged to Diane, too.
Ah.
Is there anyone in this bar you haven't been engaged to?
Well, I believe the floor is now open to nominations for "pompous ass of the year" award.
Hey, uh, remember us, uh, Dr. Sloane?
How could I forget?
Barney, Wally, Ed.
When I heard of your impending marriage to Sam, I thought perhaps I had overestimated you.
So, I pored through everything that you'd written-- letters, poems, short stories.
The pages burned with your talent, Diane, and I was singed.
Why are you telling me this?
I was so impressed by one of your unfinished novels, I took the liberty of sending it to a friend who's an editor at Houghton Mifflin.
You had no right to do that.
While he concurs with me that it's rough, embryonic and immature, he loves it and thinks it has a very good chance of being published.
Published?
I knew it.
I felt it.
I've never been more alive in my life than when I was writing that.
Which one was it?
Jocasta's Conundrum.
Yes!
I'm going to be a novelist.
I'm going to be a novelist.
Now, this doesn't guarantee publication.
He has other people to convince.
And he'll have to see the finished work.
Actually, I haven't quite finished it.
I haven't written for five years.
That's about the same amount of time you've been interred in this, uh, tomb of thought.
Oh roughly.
Well, then it's imperative you get out of here and finish this novel immediately.
You can use my cabin in Maine.
It's where I go to do most of my profound thinking.
You'll love it!
Ted Koppel has a little place right down the road.
I can't.
I'm going to marry Sam.
Do you realize the implications of the choice you're making?
There's no choice.
A woman can be married and write, too.
Oh, I get it.
You're going to write the great American novel in between driving the kids to Little League games, changing a litter box and teaching Sam pinochle so you can finally have the Mundanes over to dinner.
Well, even if I can't do both, I don't care.
Of course you don't.
Sam's bludgeoned all the spirit out of you and dragged you back down to his level.
No one was dragged, Sumner.
Sam and I walked arm in arm to his level.
I think you'd better leave now.
Yes, I'll leave.
But the time will come when you'll look back on this moment and realize you've made a terrible mistake.
I'm glad I won't be around to witness that.
So am I. Touch?
.
How appropriate that as I take my leave of you, you are holding the eight ball.
Good-bye, Diane.
Sam?
Yeah.
Oh, there you are.
Where have you been?
I, uh, was at the dentist.
I, uh, had something caught in my teeth.
What are you up to there?
I've started addressing our wedding invitations.
So what did Sumner have to say?
Well, it seems he has submitted the manuscript of one of my novels to an editor who thinks it might be publishable with a little work.
Well, that's great, isn't it?
Yeah, it's very flattering.
And I'm not easily flattered.
Oh, I know, I know.
That's, uh That's one of the most remarkable things about you.
Thank you, Sam.
Hey, wait a minute.
You know, this this could work out perfectly.
Why don't we why don't we postpone the wedding?
Postpone it?
Yeah, absolutely.
I mean, you-you could go off and finish your book, and it'd give me a chance to do something I've wanted to do all my life.
What?
What do you mean what?
You want me to name it?
That'd be good.
Well, I, uh, take a trip to the Orient.
Yeah, yeah, I always wanted to go to the Orient.
You've never said anything about a trip to the Orient.
Well, not in so many words, but I mean, you know how much I like Chinese food.
It's Sam, I've waited several years for this marriage, and I don't want to wait any longer.
I'm starting to get scared.
Oh, no.
Something always seems to screw us up-- usually it's you.
Sometimes it's me.
Let's get married now.
What do you mean "now"?
Now.
Tonight.
Tonight?
Yeah.
You know, what's the rush?
I mean, it feels like you want to do this fast so that you don't change your mind.
You're the one who seems to be changing his mind.
No, no, I'm not, no, I'm not.
Well, good, then there's no problem.
Let's marry tonight.
Well, maybe we will, maybe we won't.
We ought to think about this.
All right, fine.
You sit down and think about it.
I'll make us some tea.
If you get stuck, call me.
I'll come in and jiggle your head.
Tea time, dear.
I've had a great life.
My grandson's a 25-game winner with the Red Sox.
Got the prettiest wife in town.
And I can still fire off the old booster rockets now and again.
And don't forget your pinochle's coming along quite well.
Yes, yes.
You know, now that I got the hang of it, I kind of like that game.
Who called there a minute ago?
That was your granddaughter, Samantha.
She said to tell her gramps that she has a new boyfriend.
Uh-oh.
What's he like?
Well, he sounds like a fine young man.
She said he has his doctorate in laser beam demolecularization.
There's only one thing that kept me from going into that myself.
I don't have the brains of a turnip.
I'll get it.
Maybe you better do it.
I'd rather watch you walk anyway.
You know, it's absolutely amazing how you've held onto your figure.
Well, it's amazing how you've held onto it, too.
Oh, Clifford.
Er you hit the jackpot there, Diane.
Oh, thanks so much.
Would you like to come in and have a cup of tea?
Oh, don't mind if I do.
Good.
When are you going to retire, Cliff?
"Retire"?
: Hells bells, Sammy.
Being a mailman's still the surest way I know of, uh, meeting the, uh Women.
Women.
I'll get it.
No, maybe not.
Let me.
We seem to be very popular today.
Evening, everybody.
Norm!
Norm!
Norman.
What's up, Norm?
Me, about 30 times a night.
Norman, shall I get you a cup so you can join us in some tea?
No, no, thanks, Diane.
I'm just here to pick up Cliffie.
We're going to go on over to Woody's bar and have a few beers.
Well, tell Woody we say hi.
Mm-hmm, yeah.
How's he doing with the bar?
Well, Sammy, he's, uh, turned it into a real family enterprise, you know.
Hmm.
He's, uh He and, uh, his kid are are working behind the bar, and he's got his-his wife and his daughter actually waiting tables.
And in the evening, they, uh, apparently take off all their shoes and socks and add up the receipts.
Oh Yep.
We're out of here.
Cliffie?
Women.
No, we're out of here.
Er eh really, eh, nice seeing you two again.
Eh, Diane, you get, uh, better looking every year.
Why, thank you, Clifford.
Yeah, wish I could say the same thing about Vera.
Oh, Norman, didn't you tell us that Vera still has the figure of a young girl?
That's right; it's tattooed on her back.
Good one.
Good one.
You know, Sam, Mm-hmm?
we are blessed.
With wonderful friends and a wonderful family.
It certainly has been a good life.
Do you have any regrets?
None.
Now, what about that book you were going to write a long time ago?
Now, don't you ever wish that you had done that instead of marrying me?
Oh, that was years and years ago, Sam.
I know that, but don't you have any regrets?
Sam Malone I wouldn't trade one minute of my life with you for a Nobel Prize in Literature.
I'll get it.
Oh.
Hello.
I don't know why, Carla-- because I love her!
Now, can we just leave this alone, please?
!
Teatime, Sam.
So, what's your answer?
"Yes" or "I need more time to think about it"?
Hmm.
Okay.
You mean it?
Yeah.
Oh, Sam!
You won't regret it.
Well, I just hope you don't.
Oh, I never shall.
Thank you.
Mm.
Come on, let's do it.
Let's go get a justice of the peace.
Better yet, let's wed at Cheers.
The bar?
It's ideal.
Right there in front of our dearest friends who've been witness to our love, seeing the good times and the bad times, shared our joys and sorrows.
How perfect.
Those dear souls who will share our moment of ultimate joy.
Better still, why don't we have 'em over right here?
We'll do it right here.
Oh, I don't want those people in my house.
All right, I got 20 bucks says they won't do it.
All right, well, I got, eh, 30 here says they, uh, tie the knot-ski tonight-ski.
I'd like a piece of that, Cliff, because you see, I'm convinced that the words "I do" are not in the woman's vocabulary.
Eh, all right, let's see how much you got there.
Come on, put your money where your mouth is.
Hey, everybody!
Hey!
Wish me luck.
Sammy, uh, let me just give you a little piece of advice I wish somebody would've given me once.
Run, Sammy, run.
Run like the wind.
Disappear into the night.
Go, Sam, go!
I understand that this has been a long time in coming.
So without further delay, uh, we'll get to the matter at hand.
You, Sam, and you, Diane, have complied with the general laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and there are no apparent impediments to this marriage.
Therefore, do you, Sam Malone, take this woman, Diane Chambers, to be your lawfully wedded wife till death do you part?
I do.
Cheers.
Oh, just a second.
Miss Chambers, it's for you.
Woody, I'm kind of busy.
Oh.
Uh, listen, she's getting married.
Can I take a message?
You're kidding.
Oh, that's Yeah, that's great.
That's unbelievable.
You're welcome.
Go ahead.
No, no, don't go ahead.
Woody, what is it?
They're going to publish Miss Chambers' book.
They're giving her a big advance to finish it.
Um, to, uh, continue Diane Chambers, do you take this man, Samuel Malone, to be your lawfully wedded husband till death do you part?
What?
Oh, yes, of course.
Why wouldn't I?
Well, then, by the powers vested in me by the governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, I now pronounce you man No, you don't.
I want to change my answer.
What did he say?
Sam Look, you got to do this book.
You have to.
I don't care about the book.
I care about you.
Go ahead, from the beginning, please.
This is inhuman.
You, Sam, and you, Diane, have complied with the general regulations and the laws of the Commonwealth No, no, w-w-w-wait-wait.
Look, I-I-I don't want to be married to a woman who's going to be always asking, "What if"?
I'll tell you what.
Y-Y-You're bad at ballet.
You're terrible at acting.
You don't you can't draw worth a lick.
You're bad at-at poetry, photography, cinema and omelets.
I mean, they're going to have to start inventing things for you to be bad at.
Make your point, Sam.
You're-you're good at writing.
I mean, I think we finally found something you don't stink at.
But, Sam, I-I Look, look, this is important for you.
I mean, I-I-I had my day in the sun.
I-I may not have been the greatest relief pitcher in the world Yeah, you were, Sammy.
Thank you.
The point is the point is I took a shot.
You've got to take your shot.
Well we've always gone with our feelings.
Yeah.
Are these your feelings?
Yes, they are.
I only want to do what's best for us.
So do you agree that we shouldn't get married?
I do.
Thank you, thank you.
Well, Maine awaits.
See you in six months.
Right.
Right.
Next time, let's have our wedding somewhere else.
Anything you say.
Hey.
Have a good life.
"Have a good life"?
What?
Well, that's something you say when something's over.
Sam, I'm going away for six months.
That's all.
So no more of this "have a good life" stuff.
You never know.
You-you could die.
I could die.
The world could end.
One of us could bump our heads and, uh, wander the streets for the rest of our life with amnesia.
Or maybe one of us will decide they want something else.
None of those things will happen.
I'll be back here.
I will.
I'll see you in six months.
Okay?
Okay.
Okay.
That's better.
Have a good life.
