{START OF EPISODE 1}
Trust me, Michelle.
You are ready.
Okay.
Come on down, you guys!
Everybody, come on out in the living room!
Hurry up!
We gotta do this right now.
Hurry up!
Come on!
- We gotta do this right now.
- Okay, what?
Michelle is ready for another try.
Freeze.
- She's just gonna do it to us again.
- No, she won't.
I've been working with her all day.
Believe me, the kid is psyched.
Let's give the little ankle biter one more try.
Come on, everybody.
Here we go.
Come on, Michelle.
Ring around the rosey A pocket full of posey Ashes, ashes We all fall down She did it again.
The kid's got a real mean streak.
First rule of rock 'n' roll: Never cut a guy's power off when he's duck-walking.
I'm sorry.
But it's time for your appointment.
And what appointment would this be?
Your haircut appointment with Mr. Stephanie.
Come on, Uncle Jesse.
Let's play beauty parlor.
Uncle Jesse doesn't wanna play beauty parlor.
- Yes, he does.
- No, he doesn't.
- Yes, he does.
- No, he doesn't.
Yes, he does.
Stephanie.
Now, listen, you're 6 years old, you're in first grade this phony crying routine and this lip motif is not gonna work anymore.
- It's not?
- No.
I knew this would happen someday.
Okay, forget beauty parlor.
- How do you play beauty parlor?
- Come to my salon!
Why am I such a sucker?
- Because you love me.
- I knew I had a good reason.
- Hey, she's not finished yet.
- Joey is going to look fabulous.
Good God.
Thank goodness you came to me when you did.
If you don't look good, I don't look good.
Joseph, I have two words for you: pearl earrings.
Those would look nice.
Next!
- Next.
- Thank you, Josephina.
- Toes up or you'll drip!
- Okay, toes up or I'll drip.
Okay, I got it.
You're gonna need a weed whacker for that bush.
No, I won't.
- Those are real scissors.
- Yeah.
Well, isn't this a pretend haircut?
- Yeah.
- Then where are the pretend scissors?
Mr. Stephanie does have other appointments.
All right, all right.
Just be very, very careful, Mr. Stephanie because as we all know, no one really cuts my hair except for Alejandro.
So have you heard who Miss Piggy's been dating lately?
Would you mind watching the girls tonight?
I wanna try my new Roger Rabbit impression at Laugh Machine.
Joey, it's Saturday night.
Oh, come on, Jess.
Please.
Pretty please.
Be a sport.
Be a pal.
Be a chum.
I'll give you a big, wet kiss.
What "oops"?
What does "oops" mean?
Hey, breakfast is ready.
We're having pan-- Cuts.
I can't believe you did that.
What did you do?
Well.
Have mercy.
- Jesse.
- I can't believe you did that.
She cut my hair.
I've been butchered.
Jesse, take it easy.
It'll grow back.
- It's just hair.
- No.
Your hair is just hair.
My hair is in her hand.
I can't believe you did that.
Here, give me my hair back.
Maybe Alejandro can sew it back on.
Jesse, would you like me to pack it in some ice?
Maybe we can get Erik Estrada to be a hair donor.
Erik Estrada.
- I'm sorry, Uncle Jesse.
- So am I. - I can't believe you did that.
- I can't believe you're still saying that.
Stephanie.
I believe she did that.
- Steph, what are you doing?
- Punishing myself.
I'm sorry, toys.
I don't deserve to play with you anymore.
Here, take Emily.
Goodbye, fun.
Honey, you don't have to do this.
Yes, I do.
I'm too dumb to have toys.
And I don't deserve pillows or blankets or sheets too.
Steph, you don't wanna sleep on your mattress.
You'll wake up with those button marks all over your back.
Look.
You know, Uncle Jesse knows you didn't do it on purpose.
So, honey, there's no reason for you to feel bad.
Come on, let's go have breakfast.
I can't leave the room.
I grounded myself until I'm 82.
You are not grounded.
I am your father and I am ordering you to play with your toys.
Here.
Daddy, please don't make me have fun.
I'm sorry, honey, but someday when you're a parent, you'll understand.
Now, come on, have fun.
Hot dog.
Michelle, don't do that.
Michelle, don't do that.
Michelle, okay.
Why don't we play a little game called Let's Clean Up Our Mess.
First, we're gonna put Mr. Magazine back on Mr. Coffee Table.
Can you do that?
Very good!
And now we're gonna do what Daddy always does.
We're gonna put them in order neatly.
We're gonna put the biggest magazine on the bottom, that'd be the Rolling Stone.
And now comes the tricky part because People, Sports Illustrated and TIME, they're all the same size.
So, what do we do?
We alphabetize.
Perfect.
And then on the very top, sweetheart, goes the TV Guide.
Go ahead, honey.
Put the TV Guide on top.
The child is gifted.
Oh, Danny, don't turn this sweet, little innocent girl into a compulsive, neurotic nut case like well, you, for example.
Okay, N-A-P.
Let's go.
Now, while you're sleeping, don't wrinkle your pajamas.
Dad, we finished the dishes.
I stacked saucers on the salad plates, salad plates on the dinner plates and the glasses by color and size.
Good work, girls.
Daddy, I've tried really hard to have fun.
Now can I please go back to being sad?
Steph, you're being much too hard on yourself.
It was just a little chunk of Uncle Jesse's hair.
Not even a chunk, it was a chunkette.
Hi.
Come on in, Jesse.
- Uncle Jesse, what happened?
- Jesse, what happened?
- Tell us what's going on.
- I started to m-- Wait.
Okay, what happened?
I'll tell you exactly what happened.
Thanks to Mr. Stephanie's pretend haircut I was forced to get a real one.
Which I hate.
After that, I hopped on my Harley and raced out of the parking lot.
Guess I was so upset, I failed to see that little tiny sign that says: "Severe tire damage".
I wrecked my bike.
Next thing I know, concrete sleeves.
- Thanks for helping me, Rhonda.
- My pleasure.
Here's my number.
If you need a sponge bath, give me a call.
And if you need a sponge bath.
Well, you look like a shower person.
Oh, Jess, does it hurt much?
Only when I think about the next six weeks.
What am I gonna do with two broken arms?
Well, I think you can scratch bowling off the list.
I think you can scratch scratching off the list.
I'm sorry, Uncle Jesse.
It's all my fault.
Oh, Steph, it's not all your fault.
- Jesse, tell her it's not all her fault.
- It's not all your fault.
- Not a big help.
- Well, let's see your new haircut.
No, I'd rather you remember me the way I was.
- Come on, let's check it out.
- No, leave my hat on!
Leave it on!
Joey!
Somebody say something.
Pretty cool.
Definite possibilities.
Yeah, you went from Eddie Van Halen to Pee-wee Van Herman.
I think you look handsome.
Well, forget the hair.
I'm just happy you're okay.
Thanks, Deej.
I'm happy you're okay too.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Stephanie, please.
Be a little more careful.
I'm starving.
I'm gonna fix myself a bowl of cereal.
- I'll get the door.
- I got it.
Takes more than a couple of broken bones to slow down Big J. Baby alert.
Danny, wait.
Was that a hungry cry or a wet cry?
- That was a hungry cry.
- In that case, I'll help you.
- Come on, let's go help Uncle Jesse.
- Help him?
I can't even hug him.
Steph!
Uncle Jesse, I'll help you.
D.J., I'm perfectly capable of making a simple bowl of cereal.
It's dead.
I think you can eat it now.
He's fine.
He's perfectly capable of making a simple bowl of cereal.
Let me give you a hand.
Now, do I look like someone who needs a hand?
You look good in a hat.
Jesse, don't make a mess.
Let's get you into your highchair, Michelle.
Thattagirl.
Keep Uncle Jesse company.
I'm gonna change for work.
- Here you go.
You might need this.
- Thank you.
Michelle, keep an eye on your uncle Jesse for me.
Okay, Michelle, watch your uncle J in action here.
We simply pour in the milk.
Perfect.
Now, we add my favorite part the bananas, or, as you would call them, "nanners".
And we simply shake.
This is too easy.
Now, we slice and peel.
We slice and peel, but how?
I got it.
Observe this, Michelle.
Observe this.
What are you laughing at?
All right, now, grab a spoon and I'm ready to enjoy a nice bowl of Oat Boats.
If you liked that, Michelle, you'll love this.
What's the matter, you never seen a grown man eat cereal before?
Not like a Great Dane.
Jesse, face it.
You got two broken arms.
Let us help you.
- If it'll make you feel better, help, help.
- All right.
Michelle, I think your uncle needs this more than you do.
Open up.
No, slower than that.
Faster than that.
Slower than that.
D.J., this is music.
- Stephanie, why don't you do this.
- No way.
All you do is mope around.
Come on, everybody's helping out but you.
- I can't help.
- Come on, girls.
All right, just forget it.
It's stupid.
I can't even play my music.
I can't take care of myself.
This is so humiliating.
Just forget it, girls, all right.
Come with me.
- Danny, open the back door!
- Got it.
- Open the back door!
- Got it.
Now, slam it.
Thank you.
Dad, Stephanie won't help Uncle Jesse.
- Steph, is that true?
- I don't wanna break him.
I don't ever wanna hurt Uncle Jesse again.
Steph, you didn't do anything to hurt Uncle Jesse.
I only scalped him wrecked his motorcycle and broke his arms.
No wonder he's so mad at me.
- Deej, why don't you go take a break.
- Really?
I'm off duty?
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Why am I still here?
Steph, I can see where you might think that you're a little bit jinxed.
Jinxed?
Daddy, I'm the kiss of death.
- Am I interrupting something?
- I don't wanna talk about it right now.
I'd leave, but I can't reach the gate hook.
Jesse, there is nothing you can do about your arms.
But there is something you can do about Stephanie.
What are you talking about?
Steph is scared to death to go near you.
- She's afraid she's gonna hurt you again.
- Well, tell the little rug rat she's wacko.
I think you should tell the little rug rat she's wacko.
In maybe a little nicer way.
You're right.
Send her out here.
Thanks.
- Hey, babe.
- Hi.
You can come a little closer.
I better not.
I'm dangerous.
That's why you hate me.
Stephanie Judith Tanner, I do not hate you.
Then why are you yelling and being so grouchy and telling Daddy to slam doors?
Well, because I'm frustrated.
- You know what?
- What?
I've been feeling sorry for myself.
I've been acting like a baby.
I didn't mean to blame you.
I'm very sorry.
You mean you're really not mad at me?
No, I'm not-- Stephanie, you made one little mistake.
Everybody makes mistakes.
Look, I'm an expert bike rider, right?
I've never had one problem.
I miss one little sign: I'm the mummy man.
Same deal with you.
How many pretend haircuts have you given?
Counting yours.
Million.
See, you're an expert too, but you made one little mistake.
Stephanie, I promise, I'm gonna be as good as new.
Okay?
- Okay.
- All right, now, you get over here and you give me the world's biggest hug.
Lay it on me, baby.
What?
Do I have the cooties or something?
Come here, sit on my lap.
Easy.
Go ahead.
There you go.
- All right, I'm gonna need your help.
- What do you mean?
Since I can't play my music I was thinking on working on some lyrics.
That is, if you could write them down for me.
I could do that.
If you write about dog, cat, tree and Stephanie.
- Can you spell baby?
- B-A-B-Y.
Good, then we have a hit.
You know what the best part is about you helping me?
- What?
- I get to spend more time - with my little buddy.
- I'm so glad you broke your arms.
- Hey.
- Hey, what?
You're hugging me, and I'm not even hurting.
You're right.
The curse is broken!
- Have mercy!
- Have mercy!
Michelle.
Thank you.
Thank you.
All right.
So, what do you think of my new haircut?
- Better than Garry Shandling's?
- No.
- All right, how about Don King's?
- No.
Thanks, I feel a lot better.
Michelle I've had a lot of time to think.
Because let's face it, there's not much else I can do.
You know how I'm always saying that things happen for a reason?
Well, maybe the reason all this is happening to me is because it's time to make some changes in my life.
You know about changes, don't you, Michelle?
You realize that since I've been 16 years old I've had the exact same haircut?
I've ridden the same Harley, I've dressed the same I've listened to the same music.
Had the same boring job, killing bugs.
You know, for a guy who likes to live his life on the edge I've been living on the edge of a rut.
No.
You know something, Michelle?
Starting right now, I'm gonna start shaking my life up a little bit.
Oh, what?
You think I'm afraid to change?
I get it.
You think I'm caught up in this whole rebel thing and I refuse to grow up.
From now on, I'm gonna be a lot more open to change.
I'm gonna start acting like a mature adult.
Joey!
I need you!
- Again?
- Well, I had four glasses of iced tea.
Okay, go on.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
- Michelle, you wanna go sleepy?
- No.
What do you wanna do?
Stay up all night?
No.
- Is Mr. Horsey tired?
- No.
- Are you gonna say anything but "no"?
- No.
What's your favorite James Bond movie?
Would it happen to be Doctor?
No.
Well, Joseph, it seems like we're unable to put a 2-year-old to bed.
- Is it possible she's smarter than us?
- Yes.
Boil that cabbage down, boy Turn them cakes brown Okay, Michelle, here is a handy hint.
If you put masking tape around your hand sticky side out it's useful for removing that unsightly lint from jacket or sweater.
There's something every toddler should know.
Okay, I made a list of the food I need for Kimmy's surprise birthday party: Grape soda, orange soda, caramel corn, cherry licorice and ice cream.
Why shop?
Just put out a bowl of white sugar.
I'll get it.
Hello.
Okay, I'll be right there.
Bye-bye.
That was my boss.
He wants me down at the station.
He says he's got some good news.
Actually, he said big news.
Ooh, that could be bad news.
Why didn't he say?
Why didn't I ask him?
I'll worry on the way.
- Bye, honey.
- Bye.
Bye-bye.
Why does he make himself so crazy?
I don't know.
But on the plus side, there is no lint on the phone.
D.J., which one of these dresses will I look cuter in at your party?
Uh, Steph, you wouldn't like this party.
It's gonna be a bunch of sixth-graders.
In that case, I'll wear this one.
It makes me look older.
Uh, let me say this is as nice as I can.
You're in first grade, and all the kids at this party are in the sixth grade.
What if I bring five other first-graders?
Okay, I've tried to be nice.
- Uncle Jesse.
- Joey.
- She won't let me go to her party!
- You're not coming.
You're too young.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hold it.
Neutral corners.
D.J. first.
She thinks she's coming to my party.
I do think that.
Uh, Steph, I have a great idea.
Why don't we have our own super-duper party upstairs.
Doesn't that sound like fun?
Does it sound like fun to you?
Thanks, guys.
- Ready for school, Deej?
Kimmy.
How could you just barge into people's houses?
Don't you ever knock?
I looked in the window.
Nobody was in their underwear.
When you're in your underwear, I knock.
We gotta get a guard dog.
Happy birthday.
Now, remember, we're going to the movies tonight so come get me at exactly 7:00.
Movies?
What happened to Kimmy's surprise party?
A surprise party for me?
All right!
Oops.
You're dead meat.
Don't worry, D.J. I'll act surprised.
Hey.
Can I invite my two friends from karate class, Nina and Melissa?
It's your surprise party.
You can invite whoever you want.
I'm free tonight.
Invite me.
D.J.: Bye, guys.
Bye.
You don't have to answer that now.
Think it over!
How rude.
Well, here it is, the set of Wake Up, San Francisco.
- You like it?
- Like it?
I love it.
I could live here.
All this place needs is a sink, a toaster oven and maybe a wall right about there.
Oh, I can't wait to meet my cohost.
- Danny should be here any second.
- Terrific.
That was him.
He'll be back.
Oh, there you are Mr.Strowbridge.
Excuse me, miss.
I couldn't wait to hear the big news.
Just out of curiosity, sir, it is big, good news, isn't it?
Very good news.
Tonight will be your last sportscast.
It's interesting how one man's good is another man's bad.
- Tanner-- - What did I do?
I'm always on time.
The ratings are up.
I never step on the weatherman's jokes.
- Who are you gonna get to replace me?
- Tanner, Tanner, I'd like you to meet the newest member of the Channel 8 family Miss Rebecca Donaldson.
- It's wonderful to meet you.
- It's wonderful to meet you too.
You're going to hire her?
Oh, please don't take any of this personally.
Are you out of your mind?
Don't take that personally either, sir.
It's just-- Before you accept this job, if you could just look at my three little girls here.
You can't see their feet, but, boy, do they go through shoes.
- Cute kids.
- You're not being fired.
You and Rebecca will be cohosting Wake Up, San Francisco.
- Really?
- Uh-huh.
- You're serious?
- Uh-huh.
I'm the new host of Wake Up, San Francisco?
Cohost.
I can live with that.
- Oh, thank you.
Thank you.
- Yes, yes.
Oh, this is great.
You'll get used to this.
- I hug everybody.
- I like people who hug.
This was just what I was hoping for.
Chemistry.
That's what's gonna take us from number three to number one.
That and the fact they moved Wheel of Fortune.
San Francisco is gonna fall in love with you two.
You'll be fine.
You'll be great.
You'll be starting Monday.
Starting Monday?
Well, that's the best way to do it: just jump right in there and have fun.
Just jump right in there and have fun?
It's gonna take hours and hours of relentless rehearsal to make it look like we're having fun.
Unless we actually are having fun.
Rebecca, no offense, but have you ever hosted a talk show before?
As a matter of fact, I have.
A.M. Omaha, for two years.
How about you?
Have you ever hosted a talk show?
That's kind of personal.
It's party time.
D.J.: Almost.
Michelle, you're supposed to be in the kitchen, not carrying around pretzels.
It's okay, Michelle.
I'll clean it up.
Michelle.
Oh, you little-- What are you doing here?
What happened?
All right, come on.
D.J.
This is a party.
Why is everyone so quiet?
They think you're cute.
Where were they when I was 12?
- Not born.
Bye.
- Bye-bye.
Okay, I promise that was the last interruption.
Oh, that's Kimmy.
Everyone get ready.
Surprise!
For me?
You shouldn't have.
We didn't.
What are you doing down here?
I just went to check the mail.
Nothing yet.
Ah, pretzels.
- Don't mind if I do.
- Well, I mind if you do.
Stephanie, please go upstairs.
Oh, dear me, I almost forgot.
I do have a super-duper party waiting for me upstairs.
Hello, what a pretty sweater.
Love your hair.
We must do this again sometime.
Surprise!
Oh.
A surprise party for me?
What a surprise.
D.J., these are the two friends you said I could invite.
Nina and Melissa.
They're in junior high.
Ooh.
I'm D.J. I'm glad you could make it.
We wouldn't miss a party for our new pal, Kammy.
Her name's Kimmy.
They wear lipstick.
They can call me whatever they want.
This party is dead.
- Hey, is your dad home?
- No.
He's gone.
- Good.
This is a great party house.
- Thanks.
Much better than the house we trashed last weekend.
- Where's the phone?
- Oh, it's over here.
Let's call Greg, Andy and the Duke.
Uh, before you call any dukes, do you mind telling me what you're doing?
Don't worry.
In an hour we'll have 50 or 60 kids here.
Hello, Duke.
What's the address here?
Hello, Duke, this is a crank call.
What a dweeb.
Hey, this party isn't for you and your friends.
It's a party for Kimmy and her friends.
D.J., you're messing everything up.
Don't you get it?
They're in junior high.
- Who cares?
- This is the land of the lame.
Come on, Kimmy, let's get out of here.
Kimmy, wait.
You can't leave your own birthday party.
You can't tell me what to do.
I'm not telling you what to do.
I'm just saying don't act dumb.
- Oh, now I'm dumb.
- You are if you stay here.
Come on, the mall's open till 9.
Let's do it.
There will be no talking in class.
Everyone turn to page.
Mr. Bear, if it's so funny, why don't you share it with everybody.
Hi, D.J. Wanna play school?
No.
I wanna quit school.
Is that because you ate lunch by yourself today?
I wasn't eating by myself.
I was eating alone.
There's a big difference.
Any questions, class?
Yes, Mr. Bear?
Mr. Bear wants to know why all the kids in school were calling you a "geekburger".
Mr. Bear is going to the principal's office.
That's the cafeteria.
I told them you weren't a geekburger.
Then they called me geekburger junior.
How rude.
It's all Kimmy's fault.
She hates my guts because I wouldn't let her friends take over the party and wreck my house.
Now she turned the whole school against me.
Don't feel bad.
I know you're not a geekburger.
Thanks.
- And you're not a geekburger junior.
- Thanks back.
But until this blows over I think I'll change my name.
To Connie Chung.
Danny, the TV is fine.
Will you stop Windex-ing?
Come on, we're dying to watch your first show.
- Okay, okay.
- Don't show it till Uncle Jesse's here.
Oh, the tape.
I knew I forgot something.
No, I have it.
It's in my bag.
What a team.
I forget, and you remember.
- Here it is.
- That's a groovy-- Have mercy.
- Hi.
- Hi.
You must be Jesse Danny's brother-in-law.
- Danny told me about you.
- Oh, yeah?
What did he say?
He said he had a brother-in-law named Jesse.
Oh.
Thanks for the buildup, pal.
- So you must be Rebecca?
- No, please-- Please call me Becky.
Becky.
I like that.
Becky, Becky, Becky.
Uh, I was gonna get something to drink.
Would you like something?
- Sure, what do you got?
- What do you like?
- Whatever you have.
- Why don't we get it together, huh?
- Okay.
- That's fascinating.
I can see why you have your own talk show.
D.J., is everything okay?
Yeah.
Fine, Dad.
I can't wait to watch your show.
- So have you found an apartment yet?
- I found plenty of them.
The problem is they all have people living inside.
People.
See, I find a sense of humor very attractive in a woman.
You know, this is gonna sound weird but you remind me of someone.
Oh, yeah?
Who's that?
- It's silly.
You don't wanna hear it.
- People tell me all the time.
Go ahead.
- It's so ridiculous.
- Come on, pretty mama, lay it on me.
- You remind me of Corky.
- Yeah.
See, people tell me-- Corky?
My little baby brother.
He used to do that same cute Elvis voice.
I remind you of little baby brother?
Yeah, it's uncanny.
Corky and I would go up to Sutter's Pond to catch frogs.
And he would always say: "Come on, little froggy mama".
Elvis never said that.
You really are cute.
We are so far from where I wanna be.
Okay, now remember, this is our first show, so we were a little bit nervous.
Play the tape.
- Just play the tape.
Why don't I just play the tape.
Great idea.
Okay.
All right.
Here we go.
Wake up!
- Good morning.
- It's time to wake up, San Francisco.
- I'm Danny Tanner.
- And I'm Rebecca Donaldson.
And we'd like to know all your names, but we're only an hour show and we've only got one phone.
I thought that was a pretty good ad lib.
Yeah, that was good.
Danny, that was a terrific 12 seconds.
Is there more?
Oh, yeah.
Wait till you see the next 12 seconds.
Rebecca comes to us from two years as host of A.M. Omaha.
Isn't Nebraska one of the plain states?
Well, Danny, we have tried to decorate it.
You didn't laugh at my joke.
- We were laughing inside.
- Yeah, kind of an internal thing.
- Should I back it up and show it again?
No.
Danny, we have lives to lead.
Okay.
This is so great.
This is so much better than reading sports scores and interviewing sweaty guys.
Cartoons!
Michelle, you just turned off Daddy's new show.
- Dad, wait!
- Yeah, this is a good one.
It's okay.
I've already seen it.
Hello.
Yeah, hold on a second.
D.J.!
Here she comes.
- It's Kimmy Gibbler.
- Oh, thanks.
Something wrong, Deej?
I told that kid a million times to keep her junk off my bed.
Pretty bummed, aren't you?
- No, I'm not bummed.
Yes, you are bummed.
You always twirl your hair like that when you're bummed.
You'd be bummed too if Kimmy got the whole school saying you're a geekburger.
- Maybe she called to apologize.
Yeah.
Well, she can dial till her fingers fall off.
I'm never talking to that little traitor again.
Oh, come on D.J. You don't mean that.
Kimmy's your best friend.
Ex-best friend.
D.J., I know you're upset with Kimmy, but that doesn't mean you throw the whole friendship out the window.
Ex-friendship out the ex-window.
You know, I know why you're so upset.
Because the people that can hurt you the most are the people you love the most.
Take me and Jesse, for example.
Is that the best example?
- It just kind of popped out.
- Just kidding.
No, he's right.
Here.
Here's a perfect story.
Just last week, Joey taped over my favorite Elvis video with Pee-wee's Playhouse.
I mean, how would you like to be sitting there watching the king and all of a sudden he's singing, "You ain't nothing but a hound dog--" : "I know you are, but what am I"?
The point is, Joey made a mistake, but I forgave him.
Erasing a friendship is a lot worse than erasing a tape.
Well, I still think she's a nerd bomber.
D.J., do you remember your beat-up, old, flat soccer ball that I accidentally threw away?
You mean the one I scored my first goal with?
- Yeah, that one.
- Yeah, I remember.
I was so mad at you.
See, you're not mad at me anymore.
- No.
- Well, see D.J., if you hadn't forgiven me, we would've missed out on all the good times we've had between then and now.
And all the good times we're gonna have.
You know what I'm saying?
You're saying give Kimmy another chance.
Sure.
Part of having a best friend is being a best friend.
Let the hurt go away, not Kimmy.
D.J., Kimmy Gibbler's downstairs.
I guess I'll go talk to her.
- Attagirl.
- Thanks.
Joseph, that-- I'm-- That was-- I'm touched.
That was-- That was really beautiful.
I think we really helped the kid out, huh, Ozzie?
We sure did, Harriet.
- Hi.
- Hi.
So go ahead.
- Go ahead what?
- Apologize.
- Apologize?
- Isn't that why you came here?
No.
My mom told me to come over here and get my presents.
But if you don't apologize, then how can I forgive you?
Forgive me for what?
Getting kicked out of my own party?
I didn't kick you out.
You left.
Because you embarrassed me in front of Nina and Melissa.
What's wrong with you?
I can't believe you'd rather be friends with girls who aren't your friends than friends with a friend who already was your friend.
I don't know what you just said, but same to you, geekburger.
- Don't call me that, Kimmy Gobbler.
- Double geekburger with cheese.
- I hate you.
- I hate you too.
Mail me my presents.
Wait.
You can't leave.
How could you call me all those names in school?
I wasn't the only one.
Everybody was calling you.
Well, you know, the G word.
But you're supposed to be my friend.
Best friend.
Best friend.
Well, if we don't make up, how are we gonna share lockers in junior high.
We won't get to go to college together.
And we won't be able to marry identical twins and be congresswomen.
We gotta make up or our lives will be ruined.
D.J., I really am sorry.
I'm sorry I brought those dumb junior high girls to the party.
I'm sorry I left with them.
I'm sorry they dumped me when they met those two cute guys at the mall.
And I'm really sorry I told everybody you were a geekburger.
I'm the geekburger.
Don't say that about my best friend.
Wait, you never opened up your birthday present.
Happy birthday.
Wow, this is, like, only the raddest hat in the entire universe!
It should be.
It cost a fortune.
- What do you wanna do now?
- Why don't we open all your presents - and go to mall and exchange them.
- But I might like them.
No, you won't.
Believe me.
I already opened them.
You won't like the denim sweater.
It's, like, not a good color for you.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Hurry up, everybody.
Let's go to the Halloween party.
Hop to it.
We're late, we're late for a very important date.
Make way for Cleopatra, Queen of the Nile.
- Why did you pick that?
- Because Dad wouldn't let me be Elvira.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
- Hey, Moe.
- Spread out, knuckleheads.
- See this?
- Yeah.
What are you laughing at, pudding-head?
- You see this?
- Ah, begonias.
Girls, we're a lock to win the costume contest.
Forget it, guys.
Candy.
We're all dead meat.
Come here, Michelle.
Boys, let's take it from the top one more time.
Here we go.
One, two.
One, two, three.
- Hold it.
- What?
Jess, you've never written an advertising jingle before, have you?
No, Joseph.
Why?
If you're gonna sell this thing, you'll need something that no one else has.
Me.
Lucy, I didn't say you could be in the show.
Oh, Ricky.
Sit down.
Here we go.
One more time, guys.
One, two.
One, two, three, four.
- Hey.
- What?
- We're back from the dentist.
- No cavities, baby.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
- All right.
Unfortunately Stephanie has her very first cavity.
Why do I have to have a filling?
I'm gonna lose it anyway, it's a baby tooth.
- Oh, come on, Steph, it's not that bad.
- I told you, honey.
It's not that bad.
When everybody says, "It's not that bad," it's bad.
Steph, I got the perfect thing to cheer you up.
You can help me rehearse my jingle presentation, okay?
Hot dog.
Now, come on, you and D.J. sit over here and pretend like you're important advertising executives, okay?
Here we go.
Let's go, fellas, ahem.
Good afternoon, I'm Jesse Katsopolis.
Your secretary saw my band play and thought the tunes were kind of catchy.
I heard you guys were looking for a jingle for your new water theme park, Splash City.
I'm a songwriter, so I thought I'd put something together.
Ready?
One, two.
One, two, three.
When the sun has got you So doggone hot You got nowhere left to run And the nearest beach Is way out of reach - There's only one place to go for fun - Do you wanna have fun?
- We're going to-- - Splash City to make a big wave - We're going to-- - Splash City the H2O craze - We're going to-- - Splash City it's nothing but fun - We're going to-- - Splash City for everyone I'm going to Splash City I'm going to have fun I'm going to Splash City Well, maybe I'll just stay home.
And.
Splash City So, what do you think, Steph?
I think it's gonna fall out anyway, it's a baby tooth.
- What?
- You even copied my name.
Hello.
What are you doing?
- Brushing away my cavity.
- She's been brushing for three days.
Kid, you can't brush it away.
You can't wish it away.
You have to drill it away.
Did you hear about Kathy Santoni?
She went in for a filling and came out with her mouth wired shut and she had to eat through a hole in her throat.
- Guess who's here.
- You.
Well, yes, it is me, but there's someone else.
It's Grandpa Katsopolis, open up.
Where are my two little ladybugs?
D.J.: Grandpa.
Grandma.
- Grandma.
- Oh, my darling.
Switch.
Ah!
Hello, darling.
You have company.
See you later, Deej.
Hey, Kimmy, still copying people's homework?
- I'm trying to cut down.
STEPH AND  Bye.
I see you're stressing good oral hygiene.
Kimmy Gibbler said I'd have to wear mouth wires and eat through a hole in my throat.
Honey, you know Kimmy has a tendency to-- Sometimes Kimmy's imagination-- Kimmy's an airhead.
So, uh, Grandpa Nick, you have anything that needs unwrapping?
Tacky, Deej.
You can't expect presents every time they visit.
Did you get me anything?
Girls, we give each other love, not toys and bags of money.
Very true.
I wanna see Michelle.
Has she learned to say "Grandma" yet?
She's working on it.
Right now it sounds like "Granola".
- Coming, Nick?
- No, I wanna finish my lecture.
Come here, girls.
Now, you can't expect presents every time we pop over.
Here's 5 bucks for both of you.
- Thanks, Grandpa.
- Thanks, Grandpa.
But remember, don't tell Grandma.
- Got it.
- Got it.
Mm, try this.
I'd rather eat the spoon.
Why don't I make a nice eggplant parmigiana, huh?
- Bless you.
- Well, what can I do to help?
Go to your room.
- I can do that.
- Yes.
Oh, I wanna eat that face for dessert.
Ooh.
Thanks, Nick, but I gotta run.
Jesse should be back any minute.
I've gotta get to the station and tape promos.
Bye, Michelle.
- Michelle, I got your nose.
Where's your nose?
Where is it?
There it is.
You wanna ride the horse?
Come on.
Let's all ride the horse.
There you go.
Irene, I have a terrific idea.
Let's have another baby.
Sweetie, if your brain was a pasture, the sheep would starve.
I read in the National Intruder that a 95-year-old great-grandmother gave birth to twins.
She had a 19-year-old boyfriend.
What are you saying?
What are you saying?
Are you saying I'm running out of gas?
What about last night?
Was I out of gas then?
You're a Texaco station, okay?
Have mercy.
- Kids in the room.
- Kids in the room.
Hi, kids.
Uncle Jesse's back.
He's got big news.
- It's about time.
- Okay.
- Joey!
- Come here, girls.
Girls, come here.
Here's 5 bucks for each of you.
- Thanks, Grandma.
- Thanks, Grandma.
Now, remember our deal.
Don't you dare tell Grandpa.
- Got it.
- Got it.
Me money.
I let you off work for your little music hobby - but tomorrow I need you early.
- Okay, Dad, I got great news.
So do I. Fraser Street is crawling with cockroaches.
It's an exterminator's dream.
- So, what's the big news?
- They bought it!
I sold my first jingle.
- All right!
- Yeah!
Oh, the man is hot.
- Pretty good, huh, Pop?
- Good going.
Now, back to the real world.
Cockroaches.
Pick you up at 5 a.m. We attack at dawn.
Ah!
Finally, he puts up Sinatra.
There is a God.
I'm doing a little redecorating.
You didn't call me up here to talk about redecorating, did you?
- How did you know that?
- Jesse, I gave birth to you.
- I powdered your little tushy.
- Stop with the tushy, Mom.
Come on.
Sit down.
Ma, I wanna talk to you about my life and my music and I hope you'll understand.
Oh, sure, I'll understand.
Hey, it's me.
I'm hip, I'm with it.
I'm bad.
Who's bad?
I'm bad, you know it.
So tell me what you have to tell me.
Okay, well, I've been working as an exterminator to earn a living until my band made it, right?
Well, selling this jingle made me realize that I can earn a living playing music right now.
The bottom line is I don't wanna work with Pop anymore.
I knew this day was coming.
I was hoping I'd be dead when it did.
- He's gonna flip out, isn't he?
- He's dreamed you'd take the business and follow in his footsteps.
But you-- You gotta follow your own dreams.
So you tell him, but when you do it - do it with love, okay?
- Love.
Thanks, Ma.
Ah, Francis Albert.
When he sings, you understand the words.
Yeah, well, you turned me on to Frank, Pop.
You know your music.
- Greeks invented music.
- And Italians perfected it.
Sit down a second, Pop.
I'm making a lot of changes in my life.
You know, I cut my hair I'm dressing nicer, I'm growing up.
And I think it's time that I made a real commitment to my career.
Really?
You're finally ready to be a partner.
This is great.
This is beautiful.
You know, son, 27 years ago I started out with nothing but a fly swatter and a dream.
Today, over one billion squashed.
Uh, Nick, ahem, you're not listening.
He's trying to tell you something.
Irene, when it comes to my son, I don't need your help.
Oh, really?
I suppose when he was born you went into labor.
You think carrying you out to the car wasn't labor?
Starting with the weight again.
That was love weight, Nick.
Come on.
Please, please.
Come on, now.
Pop, I found a way to make money doing something I love, music.
You gonna make a living with this, Mr. Musician?
How many records have you sold?
- Well, none.
- How many bugs have you killed?
- Millions.
- Ah, stick with a winner.
Pop, I can't do something just because you want me to do it.
We're two totally different people.
- We're the same.
- We're different.
- We're the same.
- We're different.
Will you listen to me?
I've made up my mind, Pop.
- Meaning what?
- Meaning - I quit.
- You can't quit.
- I built this business for you.
- Dad, it's not what I wanna do.
- Then quit.
- Okay, I quit.
Fine.
If you're out of the family business you're out of the family.
- Pop.
- Nick.
"Good night clocks and good night".
Socks.
"Good night little house and good night".
- Mouse.
- Mouse.
Hey, Jess.
Wanna help me put Michelle to bed?
No.
I just wanna watch a great dad in action.
You listen to her, you try to understand her problems.
You accept her for who she is, her goals, her values.
She's a 2-year-old.
Her goal is to eat with a fork.
Still, you respect that.
Michelle, let's cut the story short tonight because I think Uncle Jesse needs me more than you do.
Okay.
- Good night, little mouse.
- Good night, Daddy.
Did you try calling your dad?
What's the point?
He kicked me out of the family.
The point is you're sitting on the floor in the hallway like a potted plant.
Jesse, let's talk about it.
Get up.
Come with me.
Look at this room, it's a mess.
Sorry, just slipped out.
Look, Jess, I know Nick.
He didn't mean it.
He's just a hot-headed stubborn guy.
But underneath all that anger is more anger.
But underneath that is a man who's really hurting because he really loves you.
Well, he's gotta stop trying to run my life.
I'm 25 years old.
He's gotta start accepting me as an adult who can make decisions.
It's my life, man.
I'm gonna do whatever it takes to make me happy.
- Good.
Are you happy?
- No, I'm miserable.
Jesse, you're not gonna be happy until you do everything you can to make things right with your father.
You've gotta reach out to him.
Come on.
Sleep on it, okay?
- All right.
- Think about it.
Good night, little mouse.
Good night.
What am I doing?
It's 7:00.
No dentist.
I'm not going.
I'm not going.
I'm not going.
- I'm not going.
- May I help you?
- Where am I?
- In my bed.
- What are you doing in here?
- I don't know.
I had a bad dream.
I was running in a forest and all the trees were dentists and they were chasing me yelling, "Open wide, open wide".
It was just a dream.
How do I know you're not a dream telling me it's just a dream?
Ow!
I'm awake.
You're supposed to pinch yourself, you little nerd-bomber.
I'm sorry, but I'm not myself.
D.J., I'm really afraid of the dentist.
That's because you're a little kid.
A long time ago, back when I was a little kid I was afraid of getting sucked down the drain in the bathtub.
- Really?
- Yeah.
When you were a year old, I put you in the tub and pulled the plug.
And when you didn't go anywhere, I knew it was safe.
You tried to send me down the drain?
Hey, you were only a year old.
I hardly knew you.
Stephanie, are you ready to open your mouth?
- Mm-mm.
- Then how am I gonna fill your cavity?
Hm-mm.
Uh, Doc, why don't you give us a minute?
I'll go find a nice toy, just in case you change your mind.
Mm-mm.
I know this isn't as much fun as the circus but you have to be brave.
So you know what you're gonna need?
- Courage.
- Courage?
I mean: Hm-hm?
Remember the Cowardly Lion in The Wizard of Oz?
If I were king of the forest Ruff, ruff.
The Cowardly Lion thought he needed the Wizard to give him courage but he really had it all along, and so do you.
Everybody keeps their courage in a different place.
Me, I keep mine right here.
Where do you think my courage is?
I don't know but look, we're in luck.
A courage detector.
Last time I was here, it was a spit sucker.
Well, it does that too.
Let's find out where your courage is.
I found it.
This is great.
Your courage is inside your mouth.
- Really?
- Yeah, here, take a look.
See?
See in the back of your throat there, that little hangy ball thing?
- Hey, yeah, what is that?
- Well, that's your courage hangy ball.
I thought that was there for decoration.
How we doing here?
- Wanna give it a try?
- Well, okay.
You better not be kidding me about this hangy ball business.
Michelle, since I'm out of the bug biz, maybe you and I ought to put an act together, take it on the road, huh?
Here, sing this.
Sing it.
That settles it, you be Sonny.
Sing it again.
Hi.
Hi.
I thought you said Barney Manilow wasn't gonna be here.
- Pop, I asked Ma to bring you over here.
Hold that.
- I don't have anything to say.
- Nick, find something to say.
I can't stand seeing the two of you not speaking to each other.
There are two men in this world that I love more than anyone.
Marcello Mastroianni and one of you guys.
Come on.
How did you get here?
Did you take Market Street?
Market Street at this hour?
What am I, an idiot?
- Is this why you called me over here?
- Pop, what are you yelling at me for?
This is small talk, we haven't got to the fight.
Oh, yes, we have.
If you think I'm gonna admit that I was wrong, you're crazy.
- My only son quits the family business-- - Look who wants to visit Grandpa.
This isn't fair.
I was very steamed, I wanna stay steamed.
Come here, my little angel.
- It's Grandpa.
It's Grandpa.
- Nick, we have a wonderful son.
He loves you very much and you love him.
Now, forgive him or we're getting Ozzie and Harriet beds.
Come on, my angel.
Come on, that was good.
Pop, I want out of the family business, I don't want out of the family.
Come on, Dad.
What do you think, I woke up yesterday and say: "What should I do today, make an omelet or break my father's heart"?
Dad, this is one of the hardest things I've ever done.
But you can't throw me out of the family.
I'm your son.
I didn't build a business to sell to some stranger.
You really messed up my dream.
What about my dream?
Don't you want to see me happy?
- Yeah, yeah.
- Then why can't you be proud of me?
Who said I wasn't proud of you?
You're proud of me, really?
I mean, you're proud of me for standing up to you and doing what I believe?
No, I hate that.
I told you, you really messed up my dream.
But you came through on another dream.
The one about you growing up to be the kind of man I respect.
When your sister died may she rest in peace the whole family was devastated.
The way you moved in here and you pulled us all together.
The sacrifices you made to help Danny raise our granddaughters.
That really made me proud.
Thanks, Pop.
But I'm a musician and I want you to be proud of me for that too.
I want you in my corner.
Ah, I guess I was a little rough on you.
Look, I'm never gonna be happy about this music thing but I'm always gonna be in your corner.
I'm your old man.
Ma, you can come back in now.
I never left.
Ta-da!
Look who's back from the dentist.
It was great.
I got a Snoopy toothbrush dental floss, cinnamon and sugarless gum, very tasty.
For my next birthday, forget the clown.
I want a dentist.
- Look.
- Show me.
That gave me courage.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Hi, Michelle.
Nap.
You woke me up to tell me I'm taking a nap?
Yeah.
Well, thank you.
If I fall asleep again make sure you wake me up and let me know, okay?
- Okay.
- Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
- Michelle, look at this.
What is this?
- Chickie.
It's a chickie?
Pet the chickie.
Pet it.
Oh, yeah, give the chickie a kiss.
- The chickie's nice.
- Yeah.
Give the chickie love.
Give him a hug.
Oh, that's nice.
Pet the chickie.
Pet him.
Pet him.
Pet him.
- Chickie.
- Oh, this is a great picture.
I gotta get this.
Say, "cheese".
- Cheese.
- Oh, very good.
- That's nice.
So pretty.
- Let me get one of you guys.
- Okay.
- You hold her.
- Wanna take another picture?
- Here we go.
Because you're so pretty.
Becky, what do you say after the show you and I slip away and get a little lunch together?
Say, "okay".
Okay.
Very sneaky.
What are you doing here anyway?
It's Saturday and the girls wanted to come watch you guys shoot your show.
Are you laughing at me or with me?
I'm not laughing so that pretty much answers my question.
No, Danny, you look cute.
The theme of the show is a bit of country in the city.
So believe me, nobody's laughing at you.
Come here, Michelle, let's go look at the horse.
Let's look at the horse.
Isn't he the most gorgeous creature you've ever seen?
No, Patrick Swayze is.
Look at the pretty horse.
- What's his name?
- Rocket.
- Hello, Rocket.
- Hello, Stephanie.
I beg your pardon?
I said, hello, Stephanie.
He talks!
The horse talks!
And he knows my name.
Stephanie, it's Joey.
There's no Joey here.
Pay no attention to that man whose lips are moving.
That is not funny.
I'm never gonna trust another talking horse.
Steph, I'll make it up to you.
Hey, I'll show you a duck over here that sounds just like Elmer Fudd.
He goes, "Quack, quack, quack.
Hello".
Looks like that horse has taken a shine to you.
Old Rocket's been a little lonely since his owner moved to Chicago.
What's gonna happen to him?
The fact is, I'm supposed to find him a good home.
Somebody could have themselves a free horse.
A free horse?
No money?
Zero dollars?
An absolutely free horse?
- I might be interested.
- Not so fast, honey.
It costs $100 every two weeks to feed and stable him.
A hundred dollars?
I'll get back to you.
Just put the horse on layaway.
Kimmy, a horse of my very own.
My dream come true.
Let's do this together.
We'll be the only kids in the sixth grade with a real horse.
That'll make Kathy Santoni shut up about her stupid moped.
We'll get our parents to split the money.
I'll ask my dad now.
Dad.
Dad.
Can I have a pet?
I'll feed it.
I'll take care of it.
I'll be totally responsible.
- Honey, a pet is a big responsibility.
- I just covered that.
Well, I don't know.
Maybe something small like a parakeet or a goldfish.
Nothing with teeth.
Danny, we're on.
That's my dad.
Bye, Dad.
Good morning, and welcome to a special Saturday edition of Wake Up San Francisco.
- I'm Danny Tanner.
- I'm Rebecca Donaldson.
And today we're live from Golden Gate Stables.
Danny, isn't this wonderful?
It reminds me of growing up in Nebraska.
Reminds me of a rerun of Green Acres.
You know, sometimes I really miss farm life.
But not today, because I have a special 4-H kind of surprise for you.
Rebecca, I don't like surprises.
- I know.
- Come on, honey.
Come on, Marilyn.
- Hi, goat.
- Hi, goat.
Surprise!
San Francisco is gonna watch you learn how to milk a goat.
Now, you sit down right here.
Watch out, honey.
And you grab on right under there.
Rebecca, I have a thing about touching goats below the waist.
Come on, it's easy.
Like this.
Come on, honey.
Now, you try it.
Hi, Marilyn.
Danny Tanner.
Kids, don't try this at home.
- Well, I asked my mom about the horse.
- What did she say?
She said, "Kimberly Louise Gibbler, have you lost your mind"?
I didn't really have an answer for that.
Did you try asking your dad again?
No, I have a better idea.
If we take care of Rocket all by ourselves for two weeks our parents will be impressed, they'll let us keep him.
I love the way your mind works.
How does your mind say we pay for two weeks of stable fees?
My mind says if we take our allowance and all our savings we'll have just enough money.
Yeah!
All I have to do is give up shopping.
Give up shopping?
Did those words come out of my mouth?
Kimmy, how can you compare shopping to having our very own horse?
Come on, say it with me.
We're gonna get a horse.
- We're gonna get a horse.
- We're gonna get a horse.
We're gonna get a horse.
We're gonna get a horse.
Stephanie, you didn't hear that.
Of course I did.
We're gonna get a horse!
See, I heard it.
Tell you what.
If you can keep the horse a secret for two weeks - I'll let you own part of the horse.
- Which part?
- The tail.
- My very own tail?
Deal.
I think I'll name it Buttercup.
Are you sure you can trust her?
She is such a blabbermouth.
I can keep a secret.
No one knows about the bag of Halloween candy in my sock drawer.
I am a blabbermouth.
- Halloween candy.
- Halloween candy.
- Give it to me!
I want it!
- Wait!
It's not in there anymore.
It's stale.
It'll rot your teeth.
Okay, Michelle, you ready to go for a ride in your brand-new car?
Okay, here we go.
Fasten your seat belt.
Okay, Michelle, let's burn rubber.
Ready?
Beep the horn.
Oh, look out!
Hey, bum, out of my way.
- You ready for your nap, Michelle?
- Hey, bum.
You gotta be careful what you say in front of these kids.
Michelle, look at this.
We got you a toy.
Now you take a nap, and by the time you're done we'll have it all blown up for you, okay?
- She better sleep for a month.
- Hope so.
- See you.
- See you.
You and Joey are gonna be great parents.
- You guys should have kids of your own.
- Well, we've talked about it.
Actually, neither one of us is willing to go through labor.
- You need some help with that?
- No, I can take care of this.
- It's a man's job.
- All right.
- In that case, I'll get back to the studio.
- No, wait!
Don't go yet.
I'm gonna faint.
You know, I really had a great time with you.
So did I. Listen, Becky, can I ask you a personal question?
- Sure.
- Do you eat dinner?
- Almost every night.
- This is amazing!
So do I. Two people, both dinner-eaters.
How often does that happen?
- Have dinner with me tonight, please?
- I can't tonight.
I have to work on Monday's show.
It's the weekend.
Oh, I know, but this job is a big opportunity for me - and I really have to stay focused.
- I got an idea.
Take an hour and focus on some pasta fazool.
Don't misunderstand.
I really like having you as a friend.
Besides, it's gonna take you all weekend to blow up Godzilla.
- Bye.
- Bye.
What am I doing wrong?
Am I scaring her off?
It's you.
All right, I'll have dinner with you.
Come on, let's go eat Tokyo.
Rocket, we're going to take such good care of you.
- You wanna ride him first?
- You mean get on him?
In my new outfit?
Why don't I just go tell everybody in school we got a horse?
Later, partner.
Rocket, let's go for a nice long ride and I'll try to explain Kimmy to you.
Rocket, these have been the best two weeks of my life.
You're the best horse I've ever owned.
And I'm not just saying that because you're the only horse I've ever owned.
If I owned a hundred horses, you'd always be my favorite.
Hi, D.J. Hi, Rocket.
Kimmy, where have you been?
I need your $50.
- Has it been two weeks already?
- Fifty dollars, Kimmy.
- Do you like my new shirt and boots?
- Yeah, they're really nice.
Oh, Kimmy, you didn't.
- I did.
- You went to the mall?
I don't even know how I got there.
I tried to leave, but then I saw this shirt and these boots-- Gibbler, you're a mallaholic.
I'm sorry I spent the money.
I'm sorry I let you down.
I'm not ready for this responsibility yet.
Bye, D.J. Bye, Rocket.
Hi, kiddo.
Something wrong, dumpling?
My friend wimped out on me.
I only have $50.
Well, now, that leaves you about $50 short.
Now, if you can't afford to take care of the horse I gotta find someone who can.
Well, wait.
Let me check my backpack.
I have a hairbrush.
A math book that's never been used.
Oh, wait, something better than cash.
A George Michael CD.
Either that boy's wearing an earring or that gal's got some serious stubble.
No, I'm sorry, honey, I gotta have cash.
I gotta go tell the boss that he's gotta find a new owner for Rocket.
Well, wait.
Can I just take him for one last ride?
No harm in that.
I'll be back.
Don't worry, Rocket.
I'll think of something.
Nobody's ever gonna take you away from me.
- I win.
- I let you win.
- I let you let me win.
- Got it, chief.
- Would you like anything to eat, Harry?
- Let's see.
I'll have a steak, medium-rare.
We're out of steak.
I'll make you my specialty, cheese doughnuts.
- How do you make that?
- Simple.
- See, cheese doughnuts.
- Wow, where'd you learn to cook?
Hello, rug rats.
Steph, go see if D.J.'s home so she can help me unpack these groceries, okay?
- Come on, let's go see.
- Oh, good, cheese doughnuts.
Buttercup!
Wow, a horse in the living room!
I'm not even allowed to eat in my living room.
I'm gonna go home and ask if I can sleepover.
D.J., are Rocket and Buttercup gonna live with us?
No.
I came in to get Rocket a carrot and he followed me in.
I gotta get him out to the back yard.
Why did you bring him here?
I didn't have enough money for stable fees.
Once Dad sees Rocket, I know he'll fall in love with him.
But he won't love him in the house.
- I gotta get him out to the back yard.
- Uncle Jesse's in the kitchen.
We're dead.
Don't get me in trouble.
Hide the tail.
I'll get him out.
You get Uncle Jesse upstairs, and don't say a word about the horse.
Who'd believe me?
Hey, Uncle Jesse, since Daddy's not home wanna go upstairs and jump on his bed, huh?
Sound like fun?
- What was that?
- D.J. She's watching Mr. Ed.
Sounds so real, doesn't it?
Too real.
How did?
Where did you?
How--?
Help me out here.
- I can explain.
- No, no, wait, don't tell me.
You're walking by the supermarket some kid had a litter of these in a cardboard box.
Joey!
Jess, I am trying to put the baby to-- Horse.
How did you?
- Where did you?
How did it--?
- My words exactly.
Great.
Danny's gonna walk in, see this horse and blame me for the whole thing.
You know why?
Because this is very funny.
Help me.
I gotta get Rocket outside before Dad comes home.
- Steph, just keep a lookout for Dad.
- Okay.
Danny's gonna flip his gourd.
We gotta get this horse out of here.
- How do we get him out?
- We'll feed him, give him food.
- What does he eat?
- Hay.
- We don't have any hay.
- Jess, you went to the market and you didn't pick up any hay?
- Daddy's coming home.
- Guys, please.
I'm begging you.
Help me.
Jess, I got a plan.
Follow my lead and agree with everything I say.
- Okay.
- Come on.
Act natural.
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Danny we got a big surprise for you.
Right, Jess?
It's big.
Yeah, it's in the kitchen, so close your eyes.
Right, close your eyes.
- Close your eyes.
- Here we go.
Wait.
I know what the surprise is.
Joey, you're making that chili again.
- No.
Better than that.
- Watch the steps.
Here we go.
- In the kitchen.
- You are gonna love this.
- Keep them closed.
- Keep them closed.
There's a horse in my living room.
He didn't hear it from me.
What are you doing here?
Hello, Dad.
Good impression, Steph.
A little more Johnny Cash, though.
Dad, I can't tell a lie.
This is my horse.
- I've had him for two weeks.
- You can't tell a lie?
There's a horse in my living room.
There has to be a lie involved here somewhere.
I can explain everything.
How in the world did you get it?
What were you thinking?
Has it been here for two weeks?
Welcome to Father Knows Nothing.
Dad, this is Rocket.
D.J., we have to talk.
Go to your room.
Would you guys please get this thing outside?
I can't believe this.
I just vacuumed in here.
Well, you know anything about getting a horse to move?
Well, yeah, there's a little coin slot you just drop a quarter into.
All right, I'll ride him out.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Stay.
Stay.
- All right, let's go, Buttercup.
- Right here.
There you go.
Hi-yo, Buttercup!
You know how much I love horses.
I just thought if I could prove to you I could take care of Rocket by myself that you would let me keep him.
Why didn't you just come to me in the first place?
Well, I started to but then I saw you were gonna say no, so I stopped.
But then you went ahead and did exactly what you wanted to.
I'm sorry, Dad.
Well, I'm sorry too.
Because now I've got a big problem.
What?
Well, you got a horse without my permission you lied where you've been after school and you involved your sister.
For the past two weeks, it's been nothing but lies, hasn't it?
Yeah.
So how will I ever know when you're telling me the truth?
I don't know.
I'm sorry, Dad.
All I could think about was getting a horse.
I just want you to trust me again.
What can I do?
Well I don't know, D.J.
But I want you to know even if you do something I don't like I'm always gonna love you.
We'll find a way to work this out.
Here.
You're still gonna punish me, aren't you?
Oh, yeah.
Bigtime.
Well, what about Rocket?
What would you do if you were me?
I'd definitely let me keep him.
Well, I'm sorry, honey but you have to give up the horse.
I'm sorry, Rocket.
When I first wanted to get you I just thought it'd be fun to have a horse.
Now that I know you and how sweet you are you're my friend.
I'm gonna miss you so much.
Would you like to meet Rocket's new owner?
I don't think so.
We've already met.
Becky, you're getting Rocket?
Well, your dad told me what was going on and growing up on a farm and all, I really miss being around animals.
Especially horses.
So here I am.
You're lucky.
You're getting a great horse.
And, Rocket, you're getting a nice owner.
Well, D.J., I was wondering.
Maybe you'd like to help me take care of him, even ride him once in a while.
I'd love to but I have to ask my dad.
Could I help take care of Rocket after my punishment's over?
I think we can work something out.
- Thank you.
You're the best.
- You're right.
I am.
- Thank you, Rebecca.
- You're welcome.
Look, Michelle.
A horsey.
You wanna pet the horsey?
What does a horsey say?
This is a gifted child.
I love you, Rocket.

Harry's in my class.
He sits next to the crayon bin.
That's very impressive.
Listen, I've got two hours to write a jingle for Fred's Tire Town, so let me work.
I can help.
In school, I wrote a poem about milk.
It made me want a cookie real bad.
Stephanie, I'm involved in the creation of a very sophisticated musical composition-- See if this sparks anything.
It goes like this.
Fred's Tire Town How about this.
It's a very, very, very, very, very, very Very nice place She's done it again.
All right, thanks for trying.
Let's go.
Anybody who's not me, out of the room.
Goodbye.
Nice meeting you, Harry.
Jess.
You will not believe what Michelle just said: "Poo-poo".
Thank you for sharing that with me, Joseph.
Jess, this kid is not all talk.
First she said it and then she did it.
I called Danny at work.
He said it's a sure sign - Michelle is ready for potty training.
- All right, high-five, Michelle.
High-five.
So how's the tire jingle coming?
Joseph, I've lost it, man.
I'm all dried up.
I got jingle block.
Jess, lighten up.
It'll come to you.
Hey, look, Michelle, a picture of a tire.
Look.
Isn't that a cool tire?
Huh?
Yeah, it's, like, totally radial, dude.
Get out.
Go.
Get out.
Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.
"Totally radial, dude".
Totally radial-- You think?
It's funny.
Totally radial.
It's kind of hooky, actually.
Totally radial.
You got me!
Master of the Universe, your tea is ready.
I'm not Master of the Universe anymore.
I'm G.I. Joe.
And G.I. Joe doesn't drink tea.
He does when he plays house with me.
Got it, chief.
Sweet'N Low, Joe?
This tea is poison!
Freeze, nerd-bombers!
Up, up, up, up!
Better keep away from my stuff.
I got back from karate class, and I'm pumped.
You're just jealous because I have a boyfriend and you don't.
You're dreaming.
You don't have a boyfriend.
- It so happens I do.
- Who?
Him.
Me?
You're a boy.
You're my friend.
That makes you my boyfriend.
Got it, chief.
More tea, soldier?
I'm never having kids.
Joey!
Joey!
- Yeah?
What is it?
- Where's Michelle?
- Where is my little genius?
- Well, last time I saw Madame Curie she was licking squash off the highchair.
- She's taking a nap.
- Look at this.
The latest high-tech potty.
It's Japanese, it's state-of-the-art and it's digital.
Wow, it's all happening so fast.
Potty training.
Pretty soon, Michelle will be off to school.
- Meeting boys.
- Going to the prom.
Getting married.
You know, we ought to think about having another one.
The kid's back.
- You sold the jingle?
- Yes, sir!
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
Hey!
It's totally radial at Fred's Tire Town "Totally radial".
That's pretty clever, Jesse.
- Don't look at me, Joey came up with it.
- I did?
Of course I did.
Thanks to you, Joseph, I have a check for $827 and half of it, my friend, is yours.
Wow, thanks, Jess.
That is very generous of you.
But you know what's really important to me is that I get it in cash.
- I'm glad I could help.
You did more than that.
You snapped me out of my jingle slump.
I almost feel like hugging you.
Almost.
You know, this is so great.
Guys, listen to me.
We should celebrate.
Let's all go out for nonfat frozen yogurt.
Before we get down and get totally funky there's one more piece of good news.
The, uh, the agency's giving me a shot at a national commercial.
It's this thing for Kitty Krispies cat food.
Got to come up with a funny-type jingle thing.
So, Joey, if you have a little time and you'd like to do a little work together maybe, I don't know, you and I could become-- - Yes!
- Partners.
- Yes!
- You wanna do it, Joey?
- I don't know.
- Get out, Joey!
- Of course I will.
All right, good.
I really need you on this jingle.
This could make my career take off.
We'll make a great team.
Yeah, we'll be like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, huh?
- Great.
Can I be Butch?
- Not in that shirt.
Now, Michelle, with any luck this is something you'll be doing the rest of your life.
Now, watch closely.
Potty Polly sits down.
And she makes the bell go "ding, ding".
And then she gets a cookie.
Hat.
Hat.
No, no, bad hat.
Not a big hit in the Easter parade.
Let's try some different musical styles.
- Let's do a little reggae, boy.
- Oh, yeah, man.
Yeah, man.
One, two.
Day-o We eat the cat food every day-o We got that out of our system.
- You got that, man.
- All right, let's try a little-- Like a conga thing.
Like a. Like this.
That's it.
Do we like this music?
Do we like this music?
I think I threw my back out All right.
Come on, let's get back to our roots.
Let's get a little rock 'n' roll going here.
Kind of like: Yeah.
Oh, big daddy, now, this music says cat food.
All right, good.
That's the style.
That's the motif.
Now, what we need are some words.
Lucky for me, my partner happens to be the King of Comedy.
Ready, Joey?
Be funny.
Hey, what a great audience.
So where you from?
Cut it out.
Get out of here.
Come on, Joey, I need like-- Something catchy, like this "totally radial" thing you got for me.
But I need it to be cat-food funny.
Okay, ready?
Be funny.
Okay, cats.
Funny cat food.
- Funny cats, funny cats.
- Funnier.
Funnier.
Two cats walk into a bar.
Take my cat, please.
A priest, a rabbi and a cat are sitting in a rowboat.
- Joey, that's not funny.
- It's not me, it's the room.
It's like working a telethon.
We need a funny room.
We'll go to my room.
- My room is the funny room.
- All right, fine.
Now!
- Ow.
Ow.
Ow.
- Ow.
Ow.
Ow.
Ice cream race bad idea.
Funny room, funny room Everyone's going to the funny room I love coming here.
Stephanie, I was saving those ice cream bars for me and Kimmy.
They're mine.
Well, they don't have your name on them.
Yes they do.
Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle.
- Here, D.J. - Stephanie!
You're always messing up my stuff.
I warned you, and I'm gonna get you back.
You won't know when it's coming and you won't know how it's coming, but it's coming.
Can you see why she doesn't have a boyfriend?
- Warm up the funny bone a little bit.
- Good.
: Hello.
Ooh, I hate that rabbit.
And now something we hope you really like.
Thanks, Rocky.
How embarrassing.
I love you, Spartacus.
All right.
Now, that's funny.
Here, think cat food.
- Go ahead.
- Okay, okay.
I got it.
A duet.
- A guy sings with his cat.
- That's good, Joey.
All right, let me give you a little music here.
So it goes like, uh.
Well, I went to my cat the other day - Wait.
You'll be the guy.
I'll be the cat.
- Love it.
- I'll sing in a cat voice.
- Love it.
- When we go in, I'll wear a cat suit.
- I hate it.
Come on, partner.
I can get a cat costume.
My friend was in a Broadway play.
What the heck was the name of it again?
- Cats.
- That's the one!
Joseph, tomorrow morning, we're going in to make a presentation to a very important advertising agency.
Now, it's gonna be a room full of serious suits and ties.
We can't go acting like amateurs.
Trust me, I'm a professional.
Hey, trust me, I am a professional too.
Jess, they want a funny jingle.
Let's go in there and be funny.
Give me that.
- No cat suit.
- How about just ears and a tail?
Joseph, this is no joke, now.
You look me in the eye and promise me no cat suit.
I promise, no cat suit.
Thank you.
So I guess a 6-foot ball of yarn is out of the quest--?
My partner should be here any moment.
But in the meantime, can I get you anything?
Freshen up your coffee?
Sharpen your pencils?
Yeah, you look like a happy crowd.
- Right this way, Mr. Gladstone.
- Oh, good.
Hi, Joey.
- This is my partner, Joseph Gladstone.
- Hi, nice to meet you.
Great.
My partner and I have worked long and hard to come up with a campaign that we feel has strong consumer appeal.
May I present.
A cat puppet?
A cat puppet.
Joseph, I think you and I have to have a little talk.
Right after this word from Kitty Krispies.
No-- Well, I went to my cat the other day And asked him what he'd like to eat I said, "I'm sick of that junk You're feeding me How about a brand-new treat"?
He said, "I'm sick of that junk You're feeding me How about a brand-new treat"?
So I went to the supermarket To find that special blend I said, "Buy me those Kitty Krispies, man And I'll be your best friend" He said, "Buy me those Kitty Krispies, man And I'll be your best friend"  Now me and my cat are buddies We really do get along I serve him cases and cases Of Krispies now And all we do is sing this song We serve him cases and cases Of Krispies now And all we do is sing this song Now my little kitty Is sitting really pretty Eating Kitty Krispies now  Come here, you little food processor.
I got you.
Don't worry, no more potty training today.
All I really want is for you to be happy get good grades and get into an Ivy League college.
Of course, most major universities do want you to be potty trained.
Give me a kiss.
Aw.
Daddy!
Look what D.J. did.
I did it for your own good.
Boy, are you gonna get it.
Okay, Daddy, ready?
On your mark, get set, punish.
She's always messing with my stuff.
I had to teach her a lesson.
I'll take it from here, okay?
Stephanie.
Honey, you know that we need to treat each other's property with respect.
And, D.J., in this family, we do not tie together each other's shoes.
Unless there's some kind of weird emergency.
- Okay.
Sure.
Red light.
What's our rule after we fight?
- Never walk away angry.
- Never walk away angry.
Very good.
Now, go ahead and apologize.
- Sorry.
- Sorry.
Now, D.J., help Stephanie untie her shoes.
Poo-poo.
Poo-poo?
Oh, Michelle.
Oh, I'll tell you what why don't we just mosey on upstairs and, you know, just sit down, maybe on the potty and thumb through some college catalogues.
Okay, D.J., you heard the man, untie my shoes.
The man said "help" untie your shoes.
Here's some help: start with the little white sneaker.
- You have to untie them too.
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.
- No, I don't.
- You do.
- No, I don't.
You do.
No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't!
- Yes, you did!
- No, I didn't!
- Yes, you did!
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.
See what you started.
Why do I get all the blame for this, huh?
They said, "Thank you, but we're going another way".
Which is advertising lingo for: "Put your puppet where the sun don't shine".
- I took a risk.
I dared to be silly.
- Why didn't you tell me before you dared to be silly?
You promised.
I kept my promise.
I did not wear a cat suit.
You wore a cat suit on your hand.
And you stabbed me in the back with it.
Jess, this is not that big a deal.
You're not really mad at me.
There's something else bothering you.
So, what is your problem, really?
My problem: I'm living in the same house with you.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Maybe we don't need three fathers.
Haven't you ever seen My Two Dads?
Two is all you need.
- All right, fine with me.
- Fine with me!
- Fine.
- Fine.
- Fine.
This is ridiculous.
D.J., they sound really mad.
Are they gonna get a divorce?
Not if we get them to make up.
You get Uncle Jesse, and I'll get Joey.
We'll all meet back in our room.
You have a great mind, D.J. If you could only use it for good.
I'm sure there are no monsters in your closet, but I'll check for you.
I don't believe you broke a window.
I don't believe it, because it's not broken.
Well, well, well, look who's here.
Well, well, well, look who's leaving.
- I'm out of here.
- Red light.
We have a rule in this house: never walk away angry.
So say you're sorry to each other.
Please?
- Sorry.
- Sorry.
That was pathetic.
I don't wanna get anybody's hopes up but Michelle is on the verge of a major breakthrough.
Oh, my God, we're missing it.
Michelle, we did it.
That's my big girl.
All right, Michelle!
You're one step closer to a diaper-free world.
Come on, little mouse.
I'll get you ready and we'll all go out and celebrate.
Isn't that little pumpkin something.
Did you see her with that magazine?
Was that too cute or what?
Does this mean you're not gonna get a divorce?
- Divorce?
What are you talking about?
- You said there were too many dads here.
You guys heard us fighting, huh?
We don't want anybody to leave.
Uh, we need to talk.
Come on, let's sit down.
Girls, nobody is leaving this house.
Right.
We just had a little fight.
You see, sometimes in the heat of the moment you say things that you don't really mean.
You know that, you guys fight all the time.
We're sisters, we're supposed to fight.
It's our job.
Well, same with us, we fight like brothers.
You mean that?
You think of me like a brother?
Well, you definitely irritate me like a brother.
Jess, that is the nicest thing you've ever said to me.
Well, we help raise these kids together do the laundry together, we make school lunches together.
Somewhere along the line, we became brothers.
Housewives.
I'm sorry about springing that puppet on you.
I thought it would be a big hit.
I was trying to surprise you.
I guess I should've talked to you about it first.
Ah, it was cute.
I'm sorry for getting crazy, Joey.
Joey, you know that thing you said about something else was bothering me?
You're right.
I'm scared.
- You're scared?
- Scared of what?
Scared of not making it.
You don't know how hard it was to break away from my father leave the family business.
The thought of me crawling back, killing bugs again.
Admitting that I failed.
I just don't know if I'm good enough.
Jess, no one ever knows.
I go through that same fear every time I jump on-stage and try and make people laugh.
But you gotta hang tough.
You got real talent.
If it makes it any easier for you, we've all got faith in you.
"Fred's Tire Town" is my favorite song.
We're gonna sing it at graduation.
Well, I'm gonna ask.
Thank you, guys.
That makes me feel a lot better.
You know, Joseph.
A few problems in the beginning - but we did make a pretty good team.
- Yeah, we did some good stuff.
What do you say, you still wanna be partners?
Like Butch and Sundance?
- Martin and Lewis.
- Bert and Ernie!
- No puppets.
- No puppets.
Put her there, partner.
Come here, bro.
- This calls for a tea party.
All right!
Let's have some tea.
Okay, here we go.
A little toast to our friendship.
Here we go.
This tea is poison!
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
"And Cinderella and the handsome prince lived happily ever after".
Wasn't that a nice story?
Again.
Again?
Okay.
"Once upon a time, Cinderella lost a shoe found a shoe and lived happily ever after".
Bad story.
Again.
Pretty smart for somebody who drools.
"Once upon a time, in a faraway land, there lived a girl named Ella who was both kind and very beautiful".
Stephanie, what are you doing?
I'm looking for the giant glow-in-the-dark dinosaur.
You know Dad's rule: Never put your arm inside somebody else's breakfast.
Uh-oh.
He escaped.
Cowabunga, beach bunnies.
All right.
Surf's up, dude.
Hi, Daddy.
I cannot believe The Beach Boys are gonna be on my show today.
I am stoked.
Whatever that means.
You like The Beach Boys.
I like The Beach Boys.
We both like the same group?
I must be getting old.
Boy, we're mediocre.
Morning, girls.
D.J.: Morning.
Morning, girls.
Hold it.
Steph, what are you doing?
Looking for a dinosaur.
Check the Flintstone vitamins.
Thanks again for inviting me and Jess to meet The Beach Boys.
Are you kidding?
Joey, remember the first time we ever heard The Beach Boys?
- We tried to become surfers.
- What a disaster.
Who knew ironing boards didn't float?
I remember the first time I heard "Good Vibrations".
I was in the first grade.
I turned to my date and said, "Have mercy".
What the heck is this?
That can't be my giant glow-in-the-dark dinosaur.
It looks more like a dino-shrimp.
Thirty seconds, Danny.
Guys, hang in there.
The Beach Boys will be on in the next segment.
- All right.
- Go get them.
Jess, I have a crazy idea.
No.
You know our jingle for Beach Butter suntan lotion we've been trying to sell?
- Sure.
Beach Butter, butter your bod.
- Butter your bod.
- Yeah, I know the one.
- Yeah.
Well, suntan lotion The Beach Boys, our Beach Butter jingle.
- Getting any connection here?
- Joseph, these guys are legends, man.
We can't ask The Beach Boys to sing a measly jingle.
- It wouldn't hurt to ask.
- Wrong.
You ask, and I'll hurt you.
Welcome back.
I am stoked.
Whatever that means.
Well, according to our schedule my cohost Rebecca is walking down the hall with The Beach Boys as we speak.
And now I'm getting a note.
And now I'm getting a migraine.
Oh, The Beach Boys' plane can't land due to fog.
But, hey, I promised you'd hear "Good Vibrations" and I never break a promise.
- Oh, no, he wouldn't.
- He shouldn't.
I'm pickin' up good vibrations She's giving me excitations Then, the second guy goes: Good, good, good, good vibrations Then, the third guy goes: Good, good, good, good vibrations Then, the fourth guy goes:  Then, the machine goes:  Okay.
Great-- Oh.
Hi, Mr. Tanner.
Ironing your tie again?
- Is D.J. home?
- She's doing her homework.
But I'm sure you'll put an end to that.
Tough break about The Beach Boys not showing up.
I guess they had something better to do.
Ever hear of fog, Gibbler?
Danny, where's the radio at?
Quick.
Turn it on.
They're playing our jingle at 3:45.
Shh.
Here we go.
Here we go.
From a waffle to a falafel, you can get it all at Beano's.
- Here it comes.
MEN : Eat at Beano's.
That's it?
I can't believe it.
They chopped our jingle to shreds.
It's supposed to go: Eat at Beano's today Those butchers!
Okay, it's time for our big contest where you can win a dream night with The Beach Boys.
Whoa, fellas.
Including two front row seats for tomorrow night's concert.
Just be our seventh caller and name The Beach Boys hit.
No, wait!
It's the seventh caller.
"Hello, you're the third caller.
Hello, you're the fourth caller.
- Hello, you're the fifth--" - Give me that!
Hello--?
D.J., sorry.
D.J. was on the phone.
Better get that kid her own line, folks.
We have our seventh caller.
What's your name?
D.J. : D. J. Tanner.
D.J.?
- D.J., you're on the radio.
- I know, I know.
Be quiet.
Pardon me?
- Not you.
Okay, D. J. Tanner, for that dream night with The Beach Boys can you name this hit song?
"Help Me, Rhonda".
Uh.
The name of the song is.
Help me, Gibbler.
Help me, Gibbler?
Could you repeat that answer please?
- What did I just say?
- You said, "Help me, Gibbler".
Uh, I think what I said was "Help me".
Rhonda!
- Rhonda?
That's right"!
Help Me, Rhonda".
- We did it!
We won!
D. J. Tanner, you're going to be picked up in a limousine - by The Beach Boys themselves.
D.J.: Oh, yes!
You'll travel with them to their sold-out concert.
Oh, thank you, thank you!
All right, a night with rock 'n' roll royalty, folks.
And another chance to pitch them Beach Butter.
Maybe I can get them back on my show.
Have you thought about who you'll be bringing with you to share this once-in-a-lifetime night with The Beach Boys?
Everyone in San Francisco would love to go.
But remember, you can only bring one lucky guest.
Only one?
Me.
Me.
Cheeseburgers for breakfast?
- Hey, I can scramble yours if you like.
- Look, I know what he's up to.
He's making D.J.'s favorite food to butter her up so she'll take him to The Beach Boys concert.
Joseph, you're a disgrace.
Uncle Jesse, thanks for making a tape of my favorite songs.
One disgrace burger.
Hey, I had an extra tape.
And five hours to kill.
Cheeseburgers for breakfast?
Nice touch, Joey.
Any fries?
I bet I know who wants a plate of my mom's double fudge brownies.
- I do!
I do!
- Dream on, squirt.
These are for D.J., from her best friend Kimmy, with love.
If you think she's gonna pick you over her own sister then you haven't seen how I made her bed this morning.
Guys, enough of this.
D.J. is not gonna make her choice based on bribes or special treatment.
That's not how I raised my daughter, my first-born.
- Now, tell everybody who you're picking.
- Yeah, here we go.
Okay, here it goes.
I pick.
Boy, I hate to see this end.
I wish I could take all of you.
But since I can't, I pick.
- Uncle Jesse.
- Oh, yeah!
Have mercy.
- Thank you.
- Hey, congratulations.
Thanks.
Congratulations.
Well, what a surprise.
Have a great time, Jess.
Thanks.
I'll bring you guys back T-shirts and stuff.
Two T-shirts.
D.J.: Yeah.
Oh, Michelle, that's so abstract, so surreal.
- Pretty.
- Pretty.
Yes, that too.
But, honey, the secret to great art is to keep all the paint on the paper.
Dad, is this a good outfit for tonight?
Oh, yeah, that's beautiful, honey.
You're gonna have a great time.
- I can't wait.
- D.J., hold on.
Just out of curiosity how come you picked Uncle Jesse to go with you tonight?
Because he loves The Beach Boys and he's a musician.
Oh.
Well, that makes sense.
I mean, Dad, you're a talk-show host.
If I won a night with Oprah Winfrey, I would definitely pick you.
Well, thanks, but I like music too.
Just because I'm not in a band.
I mean, I grew up with The Beach Boys.
But, hey, it's no big deal.
- Dad, you don't feel bad, do you?
- No, no, it's no problem.
After all, I got to go with you to see Smurfs On Ice.
Go ahead.
Go get dressed.
Okay, Dad.
Pretty.
Oh, Michelle.
Honey, on the paper.
On the paper.
Daddy pretty.
Oh, no, Michelle.
Can you say "dry cleaner"?
Say, "dry cleaner".
Jess, picture it.
You and D.J. sitting in a limo with The Beach Boys you just happen to have a tape of our awesome totally tubular gnarly Beach Butter jingle, dude.
A, don't call me "dude".
B, it's a dumb idea.
And two, I don't have a tape.
Check your pocket.
How do you do that?
- Never mind.
Just think about it.
- Okay.
Get out.
You need to mellow down, dude.
I'm serious, man.
I said, can you--?
Hi, how are you?
Come on in.
Jesse, look at this.
An original Michelle Tanner.
One day this will be hanging in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
On their refrigerator.
Oh, great, you're both here.
I forgot I promised Kimmy we'd go ice-skating.
So, Dad, I want you to go with Uncle Jesse to The Beach Boys tonight.
Have a great time.
D.J.?
What was that all about?
Oh, maybe she thinks she hurt my feelings when she picked you to go, instead of her own father.
Did she hurt your feelings?
Well, maybe a little.
I just thought she'd wanna go with her dad.
But I guess I can't compete with Uncle Rock 'n' Roll.
What are you saying here?
You're saying that you're jealous of me?
If there's anybody who should be jealous, it should be me jealous of you.
That makes no sense.
Danny, you have something going with these girls that I will never have.
I mean, like Stephanie.
When she made her first ceramic handprint who did she give it to?
Dad.
And what was Michelle's very first word?
- Cookie.
- After cookie.
She looked up to you and she said, "Dada".
And D.J., when she gets married, who's gonna march her down the aisle?
- Dad.
- That's right, Dad.
See, there's three good reasons why I envy you.
I just hope one day I'm lucky enough to have kids that love me as much as those girls love you.
They do worship me, don't they?
Jesse thanks for reminding me how lucky I am.
You're gonna hug me, aren't you?
- You leave me no choice.
- Oh, jeez.
D.J., look.
I'm sorry I put you in a tough spot.
Picking Uncle Jesse was fine.
You two should just go and have a great time.
But The Beach Boys mean a lot to you.
I want you to go.
D.J., I've changed my mind about The Beach Boys.
- I want you to go with your father.
- I'm not going.
Well, I'm not going.
This concert was supposed to be fun.
Now everybody's either hurt or disappointed.
It's just not worth it.
I'm not going.
I'll go.
- You'll go where?
- To see The Beach Boys.
Wanna be my date?
What are you wearing?
We should coordinate.
Hold it.
D.J. is going.
I said, I'm not going.
Well, if you're not going, then no one is going.
D.J.: Then fine, no one go.
What do you mean?
Why don't you go?
You're out of it.
Hello?
Excuse me!
I'm on the phone.
No.
No.
No.
No.
Bye.
- Who was it?
- Some Beach Boy.
He called from a limo right in our driveway.
I told him no one was going.
- Wait!
Hold it!
D.J.: Wait!
Did I miss something?
- Catch them.
- Hold it!
I hope they're still-- - Wait, wait, wait.
Wait!
Okay.
Hey, you're The Beach Boys.
Come on in.
Would you mind wiping your feet first?
- Thanks, I got a clean thing.
Come on in, Dr. Love.
- Carl Wilson.
D.J.: Hi.
Hey.
Hi.
Nice to see you.
Hi, Brian.
Hi.
- Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
Wow.
You're Al.
You're Bruce.
You're Brian.
You're Carl.
You're Mike.
Hi, Bruce.
How are you doing?
Hey, Mike, Carl.
- I love your song.
I love your music.
Hey, Mike.
Is there a D.J. Tanner here?
Yeah, that's me.
Hi.
We hear you're not coming to the concert.
Bon Jovi in town?
No, it's a long story.
- Well, we've got time.
- They never start the show without us.
Let's order a vegetarian pizza.
Hey, who are these guys?
Well, Stephanie, I'd like to introduce to you the legendary Beach Boys.
Big boys.
Cute kid.
Yeah!
- All right!
D.J.: Yeah!
Yeah!
Man, this is great.
Hanging out with The Beach Boys.
Singing.
Eating pizza.
You guys wanna come up and see my room?
What am I saying?
- Uh, Jess, come here for a minute.
- Oh, okay.
Excuse me, Beach Boys.
This is our big chance.
They're at our house.
- Give them our tape.
- That's a good point.
They're cool guys.
Hanging out with us, eating pizza.
I'm gonna give it a shot.
- Go get them, partner.
- All right.
I don't have a tape.
Check your pocket.
How do you do that?
Thanks, it's really been a great evening.
And for once, nobody bugged us to listen to some song they've written.
I hate when that happens, Mike.
Okay, D.J., who's coming with you?
Uh.
Well.
Beach Boy huddle.
Come on.
Well, we talked it over and we'd like all of you to be our guests.
All right!
D.J.: Thank you, thank you, thank you.
- Thanks, Bruce.
This is so kind of you guys.
Thank you so much.
Kokomo.
A request.
Number one, thank you!
Thank you, "Kokomo".
That was really good.
Thank you for singing along, everybody, on "Kokomo".
And now, we'd like to introduce some new friends to help us sing our next song.
They are the Tanner family!
Yeah!
How about the Tanner family!
Let's hear it for the Tanner family, San Francisco!
All right!

Okay.
Here.
All right, let's see your muscles.
Muscle.

By day a mere toddler, but by night Superbaby.
Look out, it's Superbaby coming to save the world.
She got me.
Superbaby got me.
Thank you, Superbaby.
- Let's see your muscles.
- Muscles.
Mmm, great fried chicken.
Joey, this could be your most delicious meal of the year.
Thanks.
I was a little nervous at first but once I actually drove up to the takeout window, I felt strong.
- Let's clean up.
- No, no, no.
Sit.
I'll clean up.
It's our pleasure to serve you.
And for dessert, I am proud to present genuine imitation pudding.
None for me.
I have a karate tournament this weekend.
I wanna stay lean and mean.
Here, Michelle.
Kung fu this.
Oh, attack of the ninja baby.
She has broken our dinner.
She must pay.
You haven't eaten a thing.
Don't you like your potatoes?
Cookie.
Doesn't that chicken look good?
Cookie, Joey.
Okay, here are some Boston baked cookies.
- Bean.
- Beans?
So they are.
My mistake.
All right, everybody, gather around.
Gather around.
Guess who's playing at Slim's this weekend?
- George Michael?
Bon Jovi?
- Barbie and the Rockers?
No, huh.
Me.
This is major league.
I've got to find a way to fill this club.
Your worries are over.
- I'll tell the whole first grade.
- Thank you.
I got a great idea.
Why doesn't your band play on my talk show Friday morning?
- I love this man.
- Don't love me yet.
- You gotta audition for my producer.
- I'm there for you, babe.
We're doing a gig tonight.
Help me pick a song for the audition.
Hey, I'm there for you, babe.
Girls, I'll be out late.
Joey's in charge.
Great.
I'll run Michelle's bath.
Hey, I'm there for you, babe.
- Steph, this works out perfect.
- Good.
What works out perfect?
Joey's in charge.
We can stay up late to watch Tiffany: Live From Tokyo.
This works out perfect.
And if Joey gives us any trouble, we'll hit him with the secret weapon - the bunny nose.
- The bunny nose.
I'm working on a new impression for my act.
Let me know what you think.
It's Bullwinkle talking to Bill Murray.
Okay, here goes.
Gee whiz, Bill.
Why won't the girls go out with me?
Well, listen up, Winkmeister.
You know, A, you're a moose.
You got a coat rack on your head.
And B, you hang out with that whiney little squirrel, Rocky.
I mean, sure, he flies, you know, so he's got that going for him.
Oh, come on, now.
Cut it out.
I love you people.
- Isn't it fun hanging out with Joey?
- The funnest.
Let's do something with Joey tonight.
Hey, Joey, look what's on the tube.
An educational special about Japan.
It's our lucky day.
Let me see this educational special about Japan.
- Would it be Tiffany: Live From Tokyo?
- Yeah, that's it.
This is a school night.
It looks like Tiffany will be live in Japan until 10:30.
a nice long nap today.
Why did you take a nap if you didn't know this was gonna be on till just now?
Uh.
D.J., why did I do that?
Woman's intuition.
Yeah, what she said.
I know exactly what's going on here.
You waited till your Dad left to ask me because you know he would've said no.
Please.
Oh, not the bunny nose.
Steph, this isn't gonna work.
Oh, not the double bunny nose.
No man is this strong.
- All right, all right, all right.
- Yay, thank you.
- You can watch.
- Thank you, Joey.
All right, I'll make the popcorn.
- Joey, Joey, Joey.
- Joey, Joey, Joey.
Next time we go straight to the bunny nose.
Don't think we're alone now - Hi, Danny.
- Hi, Joey.
Hi, Stephanie.
Hi, D.J. Hi, Tiffany.
Bye, Tiffany.
The girls asked me if they could stay up a little late.
We had no idea he'd say yes.
Plus, it was an educational program.
- Tiffany?
- Tiffany: Live from Tokyo.
Danny, this is coming to us via satellite from one of Japan's oldest and most sacred malls.
- Oh, it's been a long day.
- Yeah, I'm bushed.
I can hardly keep my eyes open.
- Night, Dad.
- Good night, Daddy.
- Good night, Dad.
- Hold it, son.
Joey, face it.
You're a soft touch.
You let the girls take advantage of you.
I know, Danny.
I don't wanna be a bad guy.
No, no.
Freddy Krueger is a bad guy.
Sometimes a parent has to say no.
If you put your foot down they'll respect you more.
Are you sure?
Trust me, I know my dad stuff.
Okay, from now on, no more Mr. Pushover.
- Good.
- I can be as tough as any authority figure in this house.
- You can do it.
- Maybe I ought to tape the rest of that special for the girls-- But they'll watch it when I tell them they can watch it.
Well, what do you think?
I don't know about music, but I know what I like.
- Did you like it?
- I don't know.
Well, here's a fun idea.
After they sing their song, have Danny do a number with the band.
That's your fun idea?
This is your show too.
Why don't you sing?
No, the audience loves to see you embarrass yourself.
- I love to see it too.
- And I love it as well.
Don't forget I'll be in Fresno judging the Miss Kadota Fig Pageant.
That's right.
Fresno, fig judging.
- I won't have any time to rehearse.
- He won't have time to rehearse.
Trust me, sir, he does need a lot of rehearsal.
- He's not exactly a rock 'n' roll animal.
- I can get another band.
On the other hand, he does have that Mick Jagger quality.
Hello, Mrs. Gibbler.
This is Joey Gladstone again.
Have you heard from D.J. yet?
No?
Well, I'm worried sick and I don't know who else to call.
Well, listen, if you hear from D.J., tell her I want her home immediately.
Uh-huh.
Thanks.
Cookie.
Michelle, no more cookies.
Look at this.
You can eat a magic little green tree.
Stephie, eat.
Stephie?
Eat broccoli?
Get real.
Steph.
Has D.J. ever been late like this before?
I don't think so, but everything before I was 5 is a little bit fuzzy.
Hi.
D.J., you're home.
It's nice to see you too.
- You're an hour late.
- Oh, sorry.
After karate we hung around and planned strategy for the big tournament on Saturday.
It's gonna be so rad.
What'd you make for dinner?
Can we order pizza?
D.J., I was scared to death.
I didn't know what happened to you.
Joey, I'm fine.
I was with my friends.
It's no big deal.
It's a very big deal.
D.J., you know the rules.
Why didn't you pick up a phone and call me?
- I forgot.
- That's no excuse.
If your father was here, you'd remember.
Joey, why are you acting like this?
Because you had me worried sick and you don't seem to care.
- Joey, don't have a cow.
- Don't have a cow?
That's it.
This weekend you are grounded.
This weekend is my karate tournament.
I've been practicing for months.
I guess you're just gonna have to miss it.
You've gotta be kidding.
I can't miss it.
- Yes, you can.
- No, I can't.
When Dad's home, he'll say I'm ungrounded.
I wouldn't count on that.
I'm in charge here.
I say you're grounded.
No, I'm not.
I'm going to that karate tournament.
- D.J. - You can't tell me what to do.
You're not my father.
Michelle, you want some egg?
I made it look like the sun.
See, there's little rays made of cheese.
Cookie.
Now, Michelle I know I'm not your father but it would make me very happy if you ate some breakfast.
Okay, Joey.
Okay, here, Michelle.
Thank you.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
Joseph, make sure to watch me on Danny's talk show.
You too, spanky.
Gimme a kiss.
Gimme a kiss.
Egg sun with cheese rays.
Very creative.
Hey, Jess, have you seen D.J. today?
Yes, I have.
You're not her favorite guy this morning.
- Oh, man.
- Joseph.
Kid was late.
She didn't call.
You had to do something.
Just glad it was you and not me.
I hate having D.J. mad at me like this.
It's driving me nuts.
I hate all this tension.
I'm gonna go upstairs now and let her off the hook.
Joseph, take it from a guy whose father grounded him a lot.
Most of the '70s.
We yelled and we screamed, but it all blew over.
It's the right thing.
Stick to your guns.
Thanks.
You done with that, Michelle?
Oh, I guess not.
Glad to see your appetite is back.
Wish me luck.
- Good luck.
- Bye.
Bye.
Hi, Michelle.
Hi.
- Good morning, D.J. - Good day, Mr. Gladstone.
I made your lunch.
No, thank you.
I'll be purchasing my meal.
- There's my ride.
- Have a nice day.
I intend to.
Don't worry, Joey.
I still love you, no matter how much you punish D.J. Can I eat her lunch?
Over the years, the fig has gotten a bad rap.
A lot of people think of it as only a filling for a Newton.
That's fascinating.
I can see why you're Miss Kadota Fig.
You should.
You were one of the judges.
Yes.
Well, what else do we have for today?
- Your brother-in-law's band.
- Oh, right.
Honest, the fact that we're related has nothing to do with him being here.
Unfortunately, due to your newfound interest in Kadota figs we only have time for one song.
Let's get right to Jesse and the Rippers singing "Devil With a Blue Dress On".
Tanner.
You sing.
Danny, I've had a request for you to sing your song instead.
As a special treat, here is our own Danny Tanner singing with the band.
I don't know, they're so good without me.
Hi, Jess.
Ladies and gentlemen, Jesse and the Rippers and me.
- I'm Danny Tanner.
- We'll talk about this at home.
Isn't he great?
You know, every now and then you watch Wake Up, San Francisco because it's nice and easy.
Well, this morning I had a little too much coffee so we're gonna do it nice and rough.
Hit it, boys.
D.J.?
Watch me.
Help me.
Hurt me.
Good gosh almighty.
Great balls of fire.
Tutti frutti, oh, rooty.
Proud Mary.
Jesse and the Rippers.
This weekend at Slim's.
I promise I won't be there.
Danny, I had no idea you were so musical.
Well, I was president of the Boy's Glee Club.
Yeah.
We'll see you next Monday for another edition of Wake Up, San Francisco.
Bye-bye.
Stay cool.
Take us home, boys.
Take yourself home.
D.J., what are you doing here?
Mrs. Gibbler dropped me off.
I have to talk to you.
- Guess what Joey did?
- Jesse told me the whole story.
I know you're upset, but you gotta get to school.
- But, Dad-- - Look, right after school we'll have a family meeting and talk this out.
Can you give D.J. a ride to school?
Sure.
I'm your backup band.
I'll be your chauffeur.
Would you like me to come back and peel a fig for you?
Okay, we have a family problem.
That means we have a family meeting.
- Now, who'd like to review the rules?
- Me, me, me.
Stephanie.
This is the talking stick.
Only the person that holds it can talk.
Okay?
Now that I have your attention Christmas will be coming soon.
I'm getting bigger, my bike is getting smaller.
Thank you, Stephanie.
Now, who would like to start?
I'll start.
Dad, Joey had no right to try to ground me when I have a karate tournament.
Dad, tell Joey he can't do that.
D.J., you know that when I'm not here, I turn over all responsibility for you three girls to Jesse and Joey.
Dad, that punishment is way too unfair.
Cheating.
No stick.
Shh.
That wasn't talking, that was explaining.
The reason this is so hard for you is it's the first time Joey's put his foot down.
I have to say that I side with Joseph You do the crime, you do the time.
You pay the piper face the music.
Man, you got to bite the bu-- I've been watching too many old movies.
This meeting is not fair.
Everyone's against me.
Dad, do something.
Joey's decision is final.
- How can you do this to me?
- D.J., you should have called.
- But it's not fair.
- That's right.
You should've called.
Stop it!
I hate to see everyone fighting.
Just sit and listen to what I have to say.
Danny, you told me if I put my foot down the girls would respect me.
Now D.J. hates me and my foot.
D.J. was the one who came in late without calling.
Why are you blaming yourself?
Because this whole thing started when I tried to be Mr. Discipline.
It's not me.
The best part about this family is all the love and all the great times we have together.
My family was always fighting.
I don't wanna go through that again.
Look, Joseph, there's no such thing as a family that doesn't fight.
I mean, even Herman Munster yelled at poor little Eddie once in a while.
Look, Joey the love, the fun, the responsibility, the discipline, they all go together.
When you're in this family, you're in all the way.
You did the right thing.
D.J. deserved to be punished.
Am I right, D.J.?
Okay, I give up.
I won't go to my karate tournament.
But if you're waiting for me to be happy about it, it won't happen.
- I'll go talk to her.
- No.
I'll go talk to her.
I have here the names of everyone who talked without the stick.
Uncle Jesse, me, Daddy, me again-- D.J., can I talk to you a little more?
Sure.
I'm not going anywhere, remember?
I'm worried about what's happening to us.
- We've always been buddies, right?
- Yeah, I guess.
D.J., you know we have.
I've known you your whole life.
I was at the hospital when you were born.
Boy, when I first saw you-- Talk about crying.
You were fine, I was sobbing hysterically.
- I did you a favor that day, remember?
- Joey, I was a day old.
Well, I remember.
Your mom and dad wanted to name you Farrah.
Farrah?
I said, "Hey, we can't name her after a hairstyle".
That was close.
Well, I better do my homework.
D.J., we've always been great buddies.
And I thought that living together would bring us even closer.
But now that I'm like a parent, it kind of changes things.
Yeah.
I never pictured you punishing me.
Yeah, me either.
D.J. Last night when I didn't know where you were, I was scared to death.
If anything ever happened to you.
I'm sorry about all those mean things I said to you.
I was just mad.
Well, that's good.
Because I love you so much.
I love you too, Joey.
Hey, if it weren't for you, I'd be Farrah Jo Tanner.
You know what I'm thinking, Deej?
I'm kind of new at this discipline thing.
I know that you should be grounded but maybe grounding you for this weekend was a little unfair.
You mean it?
I can go to my karate tournament?
- Yeah, what the heck.
- Thank you, thank you, thank you.
You're gonna make a great dad.
- Because you got what you wanted?
- No.
Because you were fair.
Well, thanks.
Now remember, next weekend you're grounded.
Oh, that's fine, that's great, that's perfect.
Oh, wait, I just remembered.
Kimmy and I had plans to go horseback riding.
You know I had to try.
Okay, just karate.
Okay, I'm convinced.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
- Stop.
- Where you headed, toots?
- Kitchen.
- Kitchen?
Hop on.
That'll be 50 cents, please.
Okay, this crazy sock Goes with this wacky sock And this sock goes-- Well, at least we came out even, Michelle.
- My sock.
- Oh, there it is.
All right, where's my sock, Poopy Longstockings?
Sock bye-bye.
"Sock bye-bye".
Come here, you.
Oh, yeah.
Danny, if you guys get some matching outfits you could go on Dance Fever.
Life is so beautiful.
I met someone today at the market.
Julio Iglesias?
Her name is Denise.
We met in the produce section.
She turned to me and said: "The broccoli looks fresh today".
And I looked deep into her eyes and I said, "It's a great source of fiber".
Next thing I knew, she was coming over here for dinner tonight.
Hold it a second.
You picked up a woman at the market?
That wasn't on the shopping list.
Well, there's just one little snag.
Denise had dinner plans tonight with her two single friends so I told her, "I've got two single roommates.
Maybe--" Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I do not go on blind dates, capeesh?
Look, I'm not gonna beg you.
Yes, I am.
Please do this for me.
Aah!
Okay.
I'll do it if you stop hugging.
Thank you.
You guys are the best.
Hey, Danny, why didn't you beg me?
- Joey-- - Okay, I'll do it.
Great.
Okay, I'm with Denise.
You guys are with Cheryl and Zoey.
Zoey?
She's your date.
- Hey, why do I get Zoey?
- Because Joey and Zoey.
You already make a cute couple.
All right, let's make these girls something nice, huh?
Michelle do you happen to know how my sock got in the freezer, young lady?
Joey.
Jess, she's trying to frame me.
Look at her shifty eyes.
And I thought while Uncle Jesse, Joey and I are having our dinner party you girls could stay with the Gibblers.
I hate going there.
All they do is watch the Home Shopping Network.
Dad, why don't you let me babysit?
It's the perfect job for me.
D.J., babysitting is a big responsibility.
But since I will be right downstairs, I suppose we can give it a try.
Steph, you mind your big sister.
- You can't put D.J. in charge of me.
- Why not?
Because when you're around, she's a sweet little angel.
The minute you leave, it's  "I'll get you, my pretty".
Isn't she precious?
Dad, don't worry.
I'm ready for the responsibility I'm ready to be in charge, and I'm ready for 3 dollars an hour.
You want me to pay you to stay at home and spend an evening with your little sisters?
Good point.
Three fifty.
- Two fifty.
- Deal.
Deal.
Why do I feel like I'm raising a used-car salesman?
I'll get you, my pretty.
And your little bear too.
Thanks for going on these blind dates tonight.
Everything is gonna work out great.
We're there for you.
And the important thing is that you have a good time.
Thanks.
I can't believe I really met a woman.
I was charming, I asked her out, and she said yes.
I was like a real guy, wasn't I?
Well, as opposed to an inflatable guy, I'd say yes.
All right, open wide.
Very good.
It is a masterpiece.
Check it out.
Oh, yeah.
No wonder she digs me.
I'm happening.
You know, I've been thinking.
Maybe it's time to take my wedding ring off.
What do you think?
Well, it's your decision.
Yeah, Jesse's right.
Pam gave this ring to me It's like a part of me.
I know my sister, and I know she'd want you to get on with your life.
Just because you start something new doesn't make your memories any less special.
Thanks, guys.
What would I do without you?
Well, you'd be stuck with three dates tonight.
Which wouldn't be so bad.
Kimmy, this babysitting job is such a piece of cake.
I get paid $2.50 an hour for watching TV and having Stephanie wait on me hand and foot.
Okay, here's your popcorn, your soda TV Guide, extra napkins and salt.
Thank you.
Will you get my slippers for me, please?
Now the queen wants her slippers.
We have to keep Her Majesty happy.
Slippers.
Aren't you gonna put them on me?
I'm not touching your cootie feet.
Let me see.
- The tie is fine?
Everything looks good, you look good.
Here we go.
Hi.
Come on in.
I'm Danny.
You must be Cheryl and Zoey.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Where's Denise?
She backed out, didn't she?
I knew it.
Well, you guys have fun, I'll just catch a movie or something.
Denise is just trying to find a parking space.
Oh, great.
Park on the sidewalk!
- I'm Jesse.
- I'm Cheryl.
- I'm Zoey.
- I'm a happy camper.
Zoey, what an unusual name.
Are you one of Frank Zappa's kids?
I was named after my grandmother.
It was her dying wish that her name live on.
Ouch.
Well, this is going along swimmingly.
Why don't I jet into the kitchen and check on my cheese delights.
Shall I?
Excuse me.
Joseph, you're on a roll.
- Denise.
- Danny, hi.
Oh, I brought you these.
Aww.
A broccoli bouquet.
You remembered our vegetable.
Come on in.
I'd like you to meet my best friend, Joey.
- Oh, and that's my brother-in-law-- - Jesse.
- Denise.
- I never thought I'd see you again.
Have you two met?
Well, we were sort of involved a while back.
You're that Denise?
- This is the Jesse?
- The one you named your puppy after?
Well, that's all ancient history now.
The important thing is that my brother-in-law and a dear old friend have stumbled upon each other and, frankly, don't they make a cute couple?
Well, saved by the cheese delights.
Excuse me.
- You're on a roll, Jess.
- Shut up.
Come on, Michelle.
Follow me.
Who do we look like, Michelle?
Daddy.
Now we're gonna smell like Daddy.
Freeze, nerdbombers.
What are you doing dressed in Dad's stuff?
I tried to stop her.
Shame on you, Michelle.
I can't take my eye off you children for a minute.
Okay, now, take all Dad's stuff off now.
Okay, don't have a hissy fit.
Hey, that's Dad's watch.
And his wedding ring.
I'm in charge, and I say you're both in really big trouble.
Dad's wedding ring went down the drain.
Uh-oh.
Okay, Michelle's in bed.
Did you get Daddy's wedding ring out of the drain yet?
No, but I got a plan.
If I stick this gum to the end of a tie I'll just stuff the tie down the drain and when the ring sticks to the gum, I'll pull it up and voilÃ .
You're gonna ruin Dad's tie.
The ring is more important than the tie.
You're so dumb.
I'm dumb?
Who knocked the ring down the drain, Miss Rocket Scientist?
Okay, wait.
I think I got it.
Oh, no.
It's stuck.
Well, I'd say the day's about shot.
- Good night.
- Freeze.
I have to take this sink apart, and you have to help me get Dad's toolbox.
If I help you, will you let me stay up late and do whatever I want?
Sure, why not?
I'll never be in charge again.
Thank you.
Well, doesn't that look like a Hallmark card, huh?
Jess, this looks great.
- You're the king of blackened swordfish.
- Thank you, Joseph.
I remember the first time we ate blackened swordfish.
That weekend in New Orleans.
You're that Denise too?
Help me out here, will you?
Yeah, she's that Denise too.
Oh, I got you.
Uh, does anybody here like impressions?
Oh, I love impressions.
- Oh, he's great.
- Thanks, Jess.
This is kind of a weird one.
This Jimi Hendrix on guitar.
Here we go.
Jimi Hendrix was a great artist who lived a tortured and tragic life.
Ouch.
Hi, I'm Stephanie Judith Tanner.
I live upstairs.
Then why aren't you upstairs living?
Because I came down to teach you a new song I learned in school today.
Come on, everybody.
Okay-- Okay.
Now, this has to be the right pipe.
Now, when the ring falls out, catch it.
Are you ready?
- I'm ready, D.J. - Okay.
Did you catch the ring?
Did I catch the ring?
Do I look like I caught the ring?
- Do you know how to turn this off?
- Another stupid question.
Well, get me something to catch the water in!
Got it.
Here.
Great.
It's working.
But it's filling up fast.
Get me something bigger.
Got it.
This is worth more than $2.50 an hour.
Here's a big bowl.
It's full of popcorn.
Stephanie, just throw it away.
- Now what?
- Just get rid of the water.
I did it.
D. You did nothing.
What are we gonna do?
Let's get into our bathing suits.
Danny, your water pressure's a little low.
That should be my only problem.
I'll give you this.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I'll be in the living room.
Jess, is there any woman in this city you haven't dated?
Danny, Denise and I are over, done with.
She came because you two had a magical moment in the produce department.
- You really think so?
- Yes, of course.
She brought you a bouquet of broccoli.
No woman's ever brought me broccoli.
Now, you get your fanny in there, and you turn on that vegetable charm.
Get them, champ.
Cheryl, can I give you a hand with those glasses?
Denise is my best friend.
I'm sorry, I was way out of line for asking, excuse me.
Listen, Denise.
I know this must be kind of awkward with Jesse and all.
It is for me.
Danny, I am so sorry.
I'm not being fair to you.
I'm just gonna put Jesse out of my mind.
I came over here tonight because I thought you were sweet and charming.
- Now what do you think?
- I still think you're sweet and charming.
That is so sweet and charming of you to say that I'm sweet and charming.
- Danny-- - Oh!
What?
I cut my lip on your earring.
Danny, I'm so sorry.
I just can't stop thinking about Jesse.
No, it's okay.
It's my fault.
I have very bad eye-to-lip coordination.
If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go into the kitchen and clot.
- Excuse me.
Excuse me.
- How'd it go?
I cut my lip kissing Denise.
That girl's a wild animal.
I missed her lips and kissed her earring.
Jess, she's still hung up on you.
I'm sorry, Danny.
Hey, if it makes you feel any better, my date hates my guts.
I promise you, next time it's gonna go smooth sailing, okay?
Can't sail without water.
Switch!
D.J., how long do we have to do this?
My fingers look like little pink raisins.
Oh!
Dad, everything is under control.
Everything's under control?
Everything's underwater.
Yay!
How'd you do that?
I just turned the water valve off, girls.
Let's remember that for next time.
You kids have been watching too much Double Dare.
Don't look at me.
She's the babysitter.
Dad, I'm really sorry.
I accidentally dropped your wedding ring down the drain.
My wedding ring?
All right.
Everybody out of the pool.
Excuse me.
I need a minute alone with my daughter.
Nice to meet you.
I think I'm gonna tuck myself right into bed and get a full night's sleep.
I'm the good daughter.
I'll take care of Michelle.
My guess is she's wet too.
Oh, let me help you, I love babies.
Jesse, could I talk to you for a minute?
Sure.
Excuse us.
You know, maybe all this is happening so that we could have a second chance.
You know, Danny really likes you.
Jesse I can't believe you didn't feel anything when you saw me tonight.
Look, the timing's all off between us.
And if it doesn't work out with you and Danny, that's okay but I don't wanna be the reason.
I understand.
It just wasn't meant to be.
But I just have one question.
Oh, yeah, what's that?
Why are you living in a room with so many little pink bunnies?
Well, I started off with two, and then.
Look, Animal, isn't Michelle cute?
Okey-dokey, Kermit.
- How adorable.
- Oh, did you hear that, Michelle?
She thinks you're adorable.
I was talking about you.
Did you hear that, Michelle?
She thinks I'm adorable.
Pretty.
Yes, she's very pretty.
I felt so bad about losing your ring.
I know I should've come to you in the first place, but I panicked.
I learned a good lesson in responsibility.
Well, okay.
Don't let it happen again.
Wait a minute.
"Don't let it happen again"?
That's the worst dad speech I've ever heard.
I'm sorry, Deej.
Not that you don't deserve a good dad speech I've just had a horrible night.
Denise and I didn't hit it off.
I guess I'm just not the dating type.
That's not true.
You're tall, you're smart, and you're handsome.
Dad, you're a fox.
If some girl's too dumb to see that, then you don't want her anyway.
Thanks, Deej.
That's the best daughter speech I've ever heard.
- I found your ring.
- Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you.
Well, good night, Dad.
By the way, about my babysitting money?
Forget the tip.
Thank you.
This means a lot to me.
How did you find it?
Oh, it was on the floor.
I just went in to clean up.
You see, I can't stand a messy bathroom.
Really?
I love that in a woman.
Here we go.
Well, Danny, thanks for a nice evening.
You're very welcome.
- Nice meeting you.
Bye-bye.
- It was nice to meet you too.
Denise, I'm glad you and I finally got to say goodbye as friends.
Me too, Jesse.
Thanks.
I really enjoyed meeting you.
Same here.
You were a lot of fun.
You're a lot of fun too.
Remember, always presoak your fine washables.
In tepid water.
Have mercy.
Call me.
- Call me too.
- Okay.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Jesse don't call me.
And you guys were worried the blind dates wouldn't work out.
Hey, the night turned out great.
Bathroom's still a mess.
I'll handle it, boys.
I'm feeling so good, I might just clean the whole house.
Well, Jess, I gotta go catch that girl.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Here we go.
Let's go, Danny.
Okay, this is for our Christmas card.
Everybody look merry, peaceful and joyous.
- Okay, come on.
This is it.
- Here we go.
Everyone say "Christmas cheese".
Christmas cheese.
- I'll get it.
- No, no, no!
- Come on.
Here we go.
- Smile.
Hi.
Merry Christmas and Happy Hanukkah to all you viewers of Wake Up, San Francisco.
I'm off to Colorado for the first annual Tanner family Christmas reunion.
But through the magic of home video, you're gonna see it all starting with our Christmas tree.
Look, there it is unflocked and fire-retardant.
And, of course, with the traditional smoke-alarm angel on top.
- There's my brother-in-law, Jesse.
- How are you?
Nice to see you again.
Guys, say something to the viewers.
Hey, you there on the couch.
Dig those kooky pajamas.
Jess, anything you wanna say?
Just that Danny's taping this vacation so he can write it off as a tax deduction.
Memo to me: Edit that out.
Careful, Jess.
The red bag is full of the girls' presents.
Joey, remember to bring your Santa suit?
Danny I am psyched.
All week long I've been working on my "Ho, ho, ho--" Home, home on the range Here's my daughter Stephanie.
This happy little girl is what Christmas is all about.
Daddy, I don't want to go on this dumb trip.
Stephanie, camera's running.
Try to be a little bit cuter.
I don't wanna go on this dumb trip.
Daddy, Santa Claus will never find me in Colorado.
He knows I live here.
Trust me, Steph, he'll be there Christmas morning.
Well, just to make sure I drew this map for Santa so he can find me.
It's got the North Pole, "You are here".
And San Francisco, "Stephanie was here".
And Colorado, "Stephanie will be here Christmas morning".
And this is a bird named Tony.
There, perfect.
Michelle, could you keep a secret?
Okay, D.J. Great, I've been dying to tell someone.
I found out where Dad hid all our Christmas presents.
I just happened to be wandering through the crawlspace in the attic.
Guess what?
I'm getting my new CD player.
Stephanie's getting her roller skates.
And you are gonna be rolling in new toys.
Toys!
You promised you wouldn't say anything, remember?
And here's the Tanner family getting ready for liftoff.
D.J., tell us what's going on.
I'm getting ready to buckle my seat belt and return my seat back to its original upright position.
I made a sign for Santa.
"Stephanie on board".
Look, Michelle, we're gonna take a trip with all these nice people.
- Say, "Hi, people".
- Hi, people.
Isn't this exciting?
It's her first trip on an airplane.
Whoever designed these airline bathrooms was not wearing pantyhose.
Excuse me.
Nice hat, Ma.
There are gonna be a lot of grandsons at this reunion.
None of them mine.
Pop, you promised you weren't gonna bug me about this.
Nick, the boy's right.
Stop pestering him about grandsons.
- At least wait until he's married.
- Thank you.
- By the way, when will that be?
- Mother.
- Hey, what are you guys doing here?
- Hey, Becky.
I don't believe this!
It's my cohost, Rebecca Donaldson.
This tape is for our show.
Say something.
Hi, viewers.
I bet Danny's making this tape so he can write off his vacation.
Well, I could do that but it would be wrong.
Becky, what a surprise.
I didn't know you were going to Colorado.
Maybe, I don't know, you and I could slip away and go skiing?
Thank you, but, actually, I'm just changing planes in Denver because I'm going home to Nebraska.
You know, I've always wanted to ski Nebraska.
You are so cute.
Well, gotta get a magazine.
That was Jesse Katsopolis striking out.
Memo to you: Edit that out.
Hey, you're sitting in my seat.
I've got 1B, child.
No, I have 1B, adult.
That makes three of us.
It seems we've assigned three people to the same seat.
Silly us.
Well, I reserved that seat three months ago and that's where I'm going to sit.
Well, I do have two openings in first class.
Oh, I'll take one.
No, you reserved that seat three months ago and that's where you're going to sit.
How would you girls like to sit in first class?
Okay!
What is first class?
It's behind that curtain.
It's a magic land where people sit in seats as big as sofas and eat shrimp cocktail.
Okay, let's get out of this dump!
Did you enjoy your dinner?
Well, the liver wasn't bad.
You had the chicken, sir.
In that case, it was awful.
First class is so rad.
We had lobster and ice cream sundaes.
What did you guys have?
We had the liver-in-a-chicken-suit.
Girls, come on.
It's the pilot's birthday and they're gonna cut the cake.
Rebecca's a nice girl.
Very pretty.
You two would make a wonderful couple.
I've tried, Pop.
She just wants to be friends.
She's one of those girls that her career comes first.
Hey, I understand that girls' lib stuff but you gotta tell them who's boss.
- I didn't hear that.
- Good.
Jesse, hold up Michelle.
I wanna get a shot of her little junior pilot wings.
Here we go.
Hey, man.
Kid, can't you see I'm trying to work here?
Smile, Michelle.
Kitty.
Hey, hey, hey!
Sir, I'm really terribly sorry.
She loves animals.
Give me back my hair.
Oh, it's okay, Michelle.
Way to go, mister.
Make a kid cry on Christmas.
It's okay, Michelle.
I'll sing your favorite little lullaby.
Everyone sing.
Sing along.
Your attention, please.
The captain's said there's a heavy snowstorm in the Rocky Mountain area so we will be making an unscheduled landing.
- What?
!
- Sorry if I bummed you out.
- Let's go, girls.
Hurry up, hurry up.
- Daddy, Daddy, we can't stay here!
Don't worry, sweetheart.
I'm sure we won't be here long.
Ladies and gentlemen due to this totally incredible blizzard, flight 411, that's us will remain grounded until morning.
- What?
- What did you say?
!
So let me be the first to wish you and yours a very merry Christmas.
I spent months planning this reunion and now we're gonna miss it.
We're gonna spend Christmas in an airport?
I told you we never should have gone on this trip.
Santa will never find us now.
Operator, if Santa's not listed, then give me the number for Mrs. Claus.
Hello?
Hello?
How rude.
Somebody do something!
I can't get Santa on the phone.
He'll never find me here.
I'll handle this.
I know how to talk to kids.
Come here, shrimp.
Excuse me.
- Is your tribe sitting here?
- Yeah.
Why?
Well, then I'm sitting way over there.
Jesse, look at Rebecca over there.
She looks miserable.
Now's your chance.
- Pop, what are you talking about?
- She needs comforting.
Times of crisis always bring people together.
Trust me.
I met your mother the day Elvis got drafted.
Pop, that's taking advantage.
I-- It might work.
- Hi, Becky, how you doing?
- Oh, I'm doing okay, Jess.
It's just that moving to San Francisco has kind of made me homesick.
I was really looking forward to spending Christmas with my family.
Ten of us kids gathered around a big turkey.
This was my year for a drumstick.
Well, I'm sure my parents would like to think of you as part of my family.
It's been so long since I've seen everyone.
You know, my little brother says Janice has really blossomed.
- Oh, yeah?
Is Janice your sister?
- No, my cow.
I'm gonna call home again.
Excuse me.
- What happened?
- She went to call her cow.
- Where's the bag with the presents?
- I don't know.
It hasn't come in yet.
They lost the bag with the presents?
Joey, what are we gonna do?
Maybe we should look for it?
You are so good under pressure.
Tomorrow when you wake up I guarantee the roller skates you asked for will be here.
How can you be sure?
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer will find you because his nose is radar.
All these years I thought it was just a headlight.
- Any luck finding the present bag?
- Nothing yet.
This is horrible.
Daddy!
Daddy!
Good news.
D.J. explained it.
Santa will get here with the presents because Rudolph has red-nose radar.
Stephanie, you know, red-nose radar doesn't always work in real heavy snow.
Are you saying Santa's not coming?
Well, if he doesn't make it here, I'm sure he'll find you in a couple of days.
But it's not the same.
It won't be Christmas morning.
Dad, what were you thinking?
I had her all cheered up and then you bum her out bigtime.
D.J., I think you're old enough to hear the truth.
The airline lost our bag with the Christmas presents.
What?
No presents?
You mean they lost my new CD player?
How did you know you were getting a CD player?
Did I say "CD player"?
Yes.
That's exactly what you just said.
Well, it doesn't matter.
I'm not getting it anyway.
Stephanie was right, we should've never gone on this trip.
This is the worst Christmas ever.
This is not going well.
Any ideas?
Kitty.
Ho, ho, ho.
Santa Claus, you found me!
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas!
Who is that?
Santa Claus.
Sit on my knee, Stephanie.
You know my name.
Well, I know when you're sleeping.
I know when you're awake.
I know if you've been bad or good.
So why are you so surprised?
I've tried so hard to be good this year.
Well, I know that you've been cleaning your room and making your bed.
Hospital corners.
I know that you ate that last slice of pizza that Joey was saving for breakfast.
You do know everything.
I also know that you've been very kind to your family and friends.
Little girls like you make the world a lot better place.
Come on, let's go see Santa Claus.
Come here, little girl.
- Ho, ho, ho, Michelle.
- Ho, ho, Joey.
No, Michelle, that's not Joey.
That's Santa Claus.
See?
It is Joey!
No, I'm Santa Claus.
Why, people all over the world come up to me and say: "Aren't you Joey Gladstone"?
What a mean trick!
Stephanie, wait.
Santa can't be everywhere at once.
So Joey is one of Santa's helpers.
I cover all the airports.
No you don't.
And don't try to make me feel better.
I'm going back to my phone booth.
- Poor kid.
- What a rotten Christmas.
The presents are lost.
I broke Stephanie's heart.
The presents are lost.
I won't see my family on Christmas.
Or my cow.
Did I mention the presents are lost?
It's all my fault.
If it wasn't for me we'd be spending Christmas at home instead of in a baggage claim.
What's the matter with you people?
The first Christmas was in a manger.
They did okay.
So what if we're stuck in this crummy dump?
Christmas isn't about presents or Santa Claus or cows.
It's about a feeling.
It's about-- It's about people.
It's about us forgetting about our problems and reaching out to help other people.
Christmas doesn't have to happen in one certain place.
It happens in our hearts.
So if you think about it we could have Christmas anywhere.
I mean, even in a baggage claim.
D.J., what do you see right there?
- A coat rack.
- No.
I see a big, beautiful Christmas tree.
Joseph, what do you see back there?
- Vending machines.
- No.
I see a Christmas dinner with all the trimmings.
Pop, what do you see back there?
- A conveyor belt.
- No.
I see-- Okay, yes, that's a conveyor belt.
The point I'm trying to make is we could give these kids the best Christmas they ever had!
And you know why?
Because "Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling 'yoo-hoo.
'" Come on.
Yeah.
That's it!
All right!
Bye, Daddy.
Michelle.
Come here, you little insomniac.
Hey.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas, Michelle.
It's Christmas.
Wake up, everybody!
Merry Christmas!
It's Christmas!
In an airport.
Hot dog.
We did a great job.
It really does look like Christmas.
And it doesn't even matter if there are no presents.
- Merry Christmas, Deej.
- Merry Christmas.
What's that?
I don't know.
Everybody stand back.
I'll handle this.
Jess, could you go see what that is?
It's okay.
It's only Danny.
Probably dreaming of a white Christmas.
Very funny.
You all right?
Come on.
Merry Christmas, Frosty.
I'll get you some hot coffee.
Does anybody have quarters for the machine?
I do, but they're frozen to my thigh.
Come on, Danny.
Sit down.
Jesse, what do you see over there?
I see Becky by the coffee machine, Dad.
I see a woman waiting to be kissed - under the mistletoe.
- Pop.
The first time I ever kissed your mother was under the mistletoe.
It lasted till New Year's.
Hey, there are two things Katsopolis men are known for: Kissing and great hair.
- Merry Christmas, Becky.
- Oh, merry Christmas, Jesse.
Listen, I want you to know, if I can't be with my family on Christmas it's really nice to be with your family.
Well, I'm happy you're with us too.
Go ahead.
Go ahead.
And I'm also happy we just so happen to be standing under the mistletoe.
- You know what that means.
- Jesse.
No, I know, you just wanna be friends.
But believe me, I hate this just as much as you do, but it is a Christmas law.
Well, I am a law-abiding citizen.
Have mercy.
That was great.
I can't wait till we can do that again.
Next Christmas.
Ho, ho, ho!
Hi, Joey.
Hi, Steph.
Merry Christmas, everybody!
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas, Stephanie!
Wait a minute.
Are you really Santa?
Give it a tug.
It's a real beard!
That means-- That means-- That means you're really Santa Claus!
And I want you to have the merriest Christmas ever.
Whoa, it's our Christmas presents!
Neato!
I don't believe this.
Thank you, Santa.
Hey, where did Santa go?
He probably went to change out of your Santa costume.
I don't think so.
Hey, guys, come here.
What do you make of this?
Look at the screen.
"Merry Christmas!
Ho, ho, ho"?
No.
I just saw Santa Claus flying away.
- You think?
- I don't know what to think.
All I know is, this turned out to be a great Christmas.
- Let's go open the presents.
- Yeah.
All right!
You're welcome, Santa.
Come on, Steph.
We're gonna open presents and sing Christmas carols.
Here we go!
My present says-- My present says "Stephanie".
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Uh, ah.
Ooh.
Do more, Michelle.
- Dip it in there.
Put it in and blow it.
- Here goes a double.
- See that?
- Huge.
Huge bubble, Joey.
Watch how I do it.
Take it up.
Now, blow it.
Wait.
Watch how big mine is.
- Good.
I got bubbles till they turn--  Look out!
- Watch this, Joey.
Look at all these bubbles.
Wait a minute.
Look at this one.
- Check this.
- Not bad.
Watch.
Triple.
- Watch this.
- Watch how many I can do.
Now, boys, I don't mind you playing but I hope you finished your homework.
- Yeah, we finished our homework.
- One more time.
Joey.
Okay, Michelle, Daddy is gonna make a home video of you to show all the nice viewers of Wake Up, San Francisco.
All right, when I say action you walk over to the table and you show everybody how you eat like a big girl.
All right, Michelle?
Alrighty.
Okay, now, go to the table.
And action.
No, no.
No horsey.
No horsey, honey.
Sit at the table.
The table.
The table.
Horsey.
Okay, fine.
We'll make it a Western.
All right.
Okay, can you say, "Yippie-yayo-kayay"?
No.
Daddy, Daddy, guess what.
I did 103 Hula-Hoops at school today!
It was awesome.
- One, two, three, four, five--  Uh, Stephanie.
Honey, I'm very happy for you but right now I'm busy making a movie about your adorable little sister.
Daddy, I can be adorable too.
One, two, three, four, five, six.
Stephanie.
I'm very sorry, but this tape is just about Michelle.
I'll watch you later.
Oh, sure.
Oh, sure.
Oh, sure.
Oh, sure.
Don't worry, Mr. Dreyer.
You're gonna have the Sweat World health club jingle first thing tomorrow morning just like we promised.
Yes, sir.
How's it coming along?
We got a barrel full of good ideas.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, I gotta-- I gotta go.
Yeah.
Another great idea just hit me.
Okay.
Yes, sir.
I promise, tomorrow morning you'll-- Joseph.
You'll have jingle magic.
Yes, sir.
Bye-bye.
Joseph, you are so immature!
I'm sorry, Jess.
I'm just frustrated.
We gotta get this jingle.
Okay, what's the problem?
I'm a funny guy.
It must be you.
This is no time to start turning on each other.
Now, we make a great team, man.
We're the best.
We're the brightest.
This jingle is taking a little extra time because we're holding out for quality.
Now, check the trash again.
Hey, remember this one?
It's that rap thing we did.
- We hated that three days ago.
- Three days ago I wasn't on my knees sifting through garbage.
Good point.
Get up.
- Okay.
- Let's try-- Oh, the jump thing.
All right, let's try it out.
If your body's looking chubby Your friends call you tubby And your wife's out shopping For a brand-new hubby Then you better stop crying And start pumping iron at the: Sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat-- Sweat World - Yes!
- Yes!
That was good, right?
Very nice.
- That stinks.
- That was the worst.
Not good.
Guess what.
I broke the first-grade record.
Watch me do 103 Hulas.
- One, two, three - Steph.
Steph.
- four, five, six - Steph.
Steph.
Steph.
- seven, eight, nine, 10 - Steph.
Steph.
Steph.
11, 12, 13, 14.
- Tell you what.
We'll watch you later.
- Later?
I'm getting to hate that word.
Stephanie, we're sorry, but your Uncle Jesse and Joey are under tremendous pressure.
- All right, let's get this thing going.
- Guys you gotta help with my science homework.
I'm desperate.
Sorry, D.J., you'll have to wait till later.
Uncle Jesse and Joey are under tremendous pressure.
Please, I really need your help.
I have to build some kind of homemade thingy to drop an egg two stories without breaking it.
- And it's due tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?
Your teacher only gave you one day to do this, uh, homemade thingy?
Well, he gave us a little more than a day.
How little more?
Maybe a day or two or 20.
Twenty?
You had 20 days to do this and you waited till the last minute, young lady?
Technically, the last minute isn't until 8:59 tomorrow morning.
You ought to start thinking about law school.
Guys, if I fail this science project, I won't get out of the sixth grade.
Oh, come on, Joey.
Please, please please, please, pretty please.
Well.
Okay.
Oh, sure.
Go right to Mr. Softy.
We don't have time to be dropping eggs.
Now, we gotta concentrate on this jingle.
Now, I'm gonna sit down right now and come up with a great idea.
Let's help the kid.
Great idea.
Ninety-five, 96, 97, 98 - 99, 100, 101, 102-- - Steph, look out.
We have work to do.
D.J., I was one Hula away from my record.
Sorry, Steph, but you happen to be hooping in my laboratory.
Hey, what can we use to build this thing?
- Uh, anything around the house.
- How about a suitcase full of cotton?
Rule number 26: No suitcases full of cotton.
Hey, no fair.
You said you were too busy to play with me.
- How come you're playing with D.J.?
- Stephanie, we're not playing.
- This is for D.J.'s school.
- Yeah, this happens to be a sixth-grade science project.
Well, pin a rose on your nose.
You're just too young to understand.
I got it.
I got a great idea.
We put the egg inside nature's perfect shock absorber a Twinkie.
Good thinking, Ding Dong.
Watch and be amazed.
All right, let's give it a try.
Let her rip.
I'm too young for this?
Sheesh.
Okay, Daddy, it's later.
Aw, Steph, Michelle was just singing the cutest little song.
I learned a new song in school today.
Steph, Steph.
As happy as I am to hear that the public schools are keeping that song alive I really have to get some footage of Michelle singing her little song.
You think you're so cute.
Don't worry, be happy Oh, no.
You are so cute.
Sorry, Mr. Bear.
My heart's just not in it.
Anyway, you're probably more interested in D.J. and Michelle.
Everybody else is.
Nobody cares what I do.
Come on, Michelle.
- You can do it.
- Come on.
- You're the best.
Hi, everybody.
I just got back from Mars.
I'm the first kid in space.
Oh, that's nice, honey.
Wipe your feet.
Shh.
She's ready to do it now.
Don't mess up her concentration.
Ready?
She did it.
She blinked.
She's so cute.
Excuse me.
Did anybody hear me say, "I went to Mars"?
Steph, Steph, later.
Michelle, for being so cute and adorable and such a good blinker.
Joey, tell her what she's won.
Well, Jess, cute, blinking Michelle has won Stephanie's bike!
My bike?
My bike.
You get my bike for blinking?
I just got back from Mars.
What do I get?
Get the door.
Hot dog.
For me?
No, for me.
Get off my rug, you little nerdbomber.
D.J.!
Oh.
We missed you.
- My first-born.
We're so proud of you.
- What'd she do?
- I went to the mailbox and got the mail.
But I went to Mars.
Look what I learned to do.
D.J., D.J., D.J. - You are the best daughter.
- Let me get this straight.
You walked all the way to the mailbox and back all by yourself?
Talk about guts.
It was scary, guys.
There were cracks in the sidewalk.
Ooh.
Yoo-hoo, up here.
A person is flying.
D.J., let's go to the kitchen and get your party started.
Patrick Swayze's in there, and he wants the first dance.
I love being first-born.
Oh, uh, Steph, as long as you're up there could you, uh, dust the top of the mantel?
How rude.
How very rude.
Come in.
Hi, chief.
I wanna get a picture of you and your hoop for my scrapbook.
Smile.
Harry, you're the only one who cares about me.
Your family cares about you.
No, they don't.
D.J. is the oldest, and Michelle is the cutest, and I'm nothing.
I wish I could move out, but I'm stuck living here until I get married.
- Tough break.
- Yeah.
Unless you marry me.
Marry you?
I'm not even allowed to cross the street.
- Married people are allowed.
- Really?
Okay, I'll marry you.
Harry, you have to propose.
A girl waits her whole life for this moment.
- Get down on one knee.
- Okay, chief.
I can see up your nose.
Harry, this is supposed to be romantic.
Sorry.
I can see up your nose, darling.
Never mind.
We'll get married today.
I'll call our friends, and we can get a house.
Then I wouldn't have to put up with D.J. and Michelle anymore.
I'll be Stephanie Takayama.
And I'll be Harry Tanner.
I hope our egg-drop thingy works.
D.J., how can it fail?
It's quite simple.
You see, we simply drop the Tinkertoy frame down to the ground.
The elastic stretches, taking in the impact allowing the egg to remain gently in its resting place, Michelle's bootee.
All right, pal, count it down.
Ninety-nine, 98, 97 96, 95, 94-- Will you stop that, huh?
Start at five.
I love getting you all riled up.
Five, four, three, two   I'll get it.
- one.
- Eggs away.
- Oh.
- Whoa.
Good hands.
I'd like to take this opportunity to thank you all so very much for allowing me to play an important part in my daughter's education.
We're here for Stephanie's wedding.
Which way to the backyard?
- Through the kitchen and hang a left.
- Got it.
Come on, gang.
Right through here.
On the double.
- Let's go, let's go.
Come on.
- Who are all these kids?
Well, that's Dopey, Sneezy, Blinky Moe, Curly, Shemp, Spanky and of course Father Guido Sarducci as the Beaver.
Well, what do you say, guys?
- Back to the drawing board?
- Sorry, we gotta get back to writing our Sweat World jingle.
Come on.
Wait, hold it.
I got it.
All we do is slow it down.
Oh, that's a good idea.
We do it like a ballad.
Like a Sinatra thing.
Meet me down at Sweat World, baby   Will you stop that, huh?
Not the jingle, the egg.
We slow it down with a parachute.
- Oh, yes, I'll try anything.
- Let's go get a handkerchief.
Our careers are over, but we're gonna pass sixth-grade science.
Wait up.
Come on, Harry.
Let's get this show on the road.
Are you sure you know how to marry people?
My dad's a minister.
He's dragged me to hundreds of these.
Music.
Dearly beloved we are gathered here today to join Stephanie and Harry in holy mattress money.
Harry, do you take Stephanie--?
I'll take her anywhere.
After we're married, we can cross the street.
No, no.
What he means is do you promise to pay lots of attention to me no matter what D.J. does or how cute Michelle is?
Yeah, why not.
Now, it's time for the wedding bows.
Now, say, "I do".
- I do.
- I do too.
- May I have the ring, please?
- Wait.
Did you get a ring?
Better.
I got a stick-on tattoo of Scooby Doo.
Lick your hand.
Stay.
It's beautiful.
Ooh!
Stephanie and Harry I now announce you man and wife.
You may kiss the bride.
Ew!
If you don't kiss, you're not really married.
He's not a bad kisser.
- Are you ready?
- All set.
Jess, I think we got it.
Hanky parachute, double Twinkie landing craft.
Well, Mr. Wizard, we do have the technology.
Deej, let her rip.
Eggs away, take two.
Yeah!
D.J.: All right.
- Yes.
Thank you, thank you.
- All right.
- Thank you.
- All right.
You're welcome.
Now, Joseph and I have to get back to our jingle for Sweat World.
- Thank you, D.J. - You guys are geniuses.
Well, you know what Edison said: "Genius is 1 percent inspiration, What's that supposed to mean?
It means if you don't sweat it, you don't get it.
If you don't sweat it, you don't get it.
That's it, Joseph.
Let's put it with the music.
Okay.
If you don't sweat it, you don't get it - For the bod they'll admire - You got to perspire Down at Sweat World - Hey, come on in.
- And get pumped.
- That's it.
Let's go.
- Let's write it down.
If you don't sweat it-- It's a good melody too.
Come on, honey.
Oh, come on.
Come on-- Go around, go around-- Come here, you cutie.
People, I would like to make a very important announcement.
I was married this afternoon.
- Pardon me?
- Hi, Dad.
Well, don't you two make a cute little bride and groom.
You could stand on top of your own wedding cake.
Well, goodbye, everyone.
It's been a great six years.
Harry, let's go house-hunting.
No, I have to go home.
Bye, Steph.
Bye, Pop.
Wait, wait.
You can't walk out on me.
Yes, I can.
Tonight's meatloaf night.
Great.
Nobody wants me.
Steph, what do you mean nobody wants you?
Your family wants you.
Some family.
You didn't even care that I broke the Hula-Hoop record or went to Mars.
You went to Mars?
Maybe we have been a tad preoccupied.
Kiddo, we're-- We're sorry if we ignored you.
We didn't mean to.
Yeah, I think we were just a little caught up in what we were doing.
Well, now that my science project's done, I can watch you Hula-Hoop.
Forget it.
It doesn't matter.
You're always gonna be the oldest and Michelle's always gonna be the baby.
I'm always gonna be stuck in the middle!
- Hold it, Goldilocks.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
See what I mean?
I'm stuck in the middle again.
- Stephanie.
- Sit down.
I understand how you're feeling.
But there's another way to look at this.
There's a lot of special things - about being in the middle.
- Yeah, your pop's right.
Take a bologna sandwich, for instance.
What's the best part of a bologna sandwich?
- The bologna.
- And where's the bologna?
- In the middle.
- Bingo.
All right, and a Oreo cookie.
What's the best part of an Oreo cookie?
- The chocolate milk you dunk it in.
- Come on, Steph.
You know where I'm going with this.
I know.
The cream's the best part.
Yes, Joseph.
The cream-- - And where is the cream?
- In the middle.
Don't help.
It's in the?
- Middle.
- Right.
Steph, what all this bologna and cookie talk is getting to is every position in the family is special in its own way.
Yeah, you're the only one in the family who has a big sister and a little sister.
That's true.
What else you got?
Well, another good thing about being the middle child is a lot of the mistakes we made raising D.J - we won't have to make on you.
- I'm getting depressed.
I'm the soggy part of the sandwich and the throwaway part of the cookie.
I like that.
Stephanie, come here.
You have to realize that sometimes your sisters are gonna need our attention.
But if you ever feel like you're not getting your fair share I want you to come and tell us about it.
Really?
I can do that?
You better.
Every time I get a little busy with something I don't want you to run off and get married.
Me neither.
I don't know about this husband thing.
One whiff of their mom's meatloaf and they're gone.
Come here, you beautiful bride.
Me next.
Okay, lay one on your Uncle J. You know how it's done.
All right.
Oh, well, come on.
Hug.
You know, I think this home video would be so much better if it had all three of my girls.
Let me see.
You wanna sing "I Write the Songs" or go for the Hula-Hoop record?
Daddy, I can do both.
Ooh!
Everybody.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
I'm so happy you could stay for dinner, Becky.
Me too.
I love to see a grown man cry.
Becky, you really ought to go out with him.
You're breaking the guy's heart.
Back off, man, I was chopping onions.
Come on in, Michelle.
Bring the bread with you.
Heavy.
There we go.
Thank you.
And for being such a good girl, you get to ride on your horsey.
Thank you, Joey.
- Try this.
- Mm.
Mm!
- Very good.
- A little garlic.
Okay.
Now that you're both here, I need a favor.
As you both know the Women in Media Charity Bachelor Auction is this Thursday.
And as you also know, I'm the one in charge of finding eligible bachelors to auction off as dates.
- So I was wondering--?
- Becky this kind of thing, it's, um, embarrassing for me.
I mean, you know, women checking me out poking me and prodding me like I'm a slab of beef.
I'll do it.
- Thanks, Joey.
- All right.
Oh, Jesse, won't you do it for me?
Please?
Pretty please?
As a personal favor?
It'd make me really, really happy.
- This is really, really unfair.
- But it's for a really, really good cause.
I'm really, really gonna regret this.
Thanks, Jess.
Guys, I gotta warn you, Rebecca's gonna try to-- - Beat me home.
- I caught all the lights.
Good news, though.
Joey and Jesse said yes.
We're gonna make a fortune auctioning dates with you three handsome devils.
Three?
Rebecca, you can't auction me off.
I'm the auctioneer.
You never auction off the auctioneer.
That'd make the auctioneer the auctionee.
It's confusing.
I'm confused just saying it.
Danny, won't you do it for me?
As a personal favor?
It'd make me really, really happy.
Well I guess I feel real special now.
Stop the homework.
But if I stop, you won't have anything to copy.
Well, this is more important.
How do you feel about Michael Monfort?
He's okay, I guess.
Well, I heard from Tom Altobello who sits next to the Epstein twins that Michael Monfort likes you.
Are you serious?
He's so cute.
But I thought he was just okay.
That was before I knew he liked me.
Are you sure he likes me?
He wants you to meet him tomorrow after school at the bike racks.
Is this a trick?
If I'm lying, I will never go shopping again.
He really does like me.
Ah.
Michael and D. J. sitting in a tree K-I-S-S-- How did you find out about this?
I-N-G.
First comes love Then comes marriage-- Does the whole school know?
I don't think the third grade knows.
They were on a field trip.
Then comes D. J. with a baby carriage  Michael and D. J. sitting in a tree.
All right, now when Michael gets here we have to be cool.
- Right.
How do I look?
- You look great.
How do I look?
What's the difference?
Here he comes.
- Hi, Michael.
- Hey, Gibbler.
Bye, Michael.
Tell me everything.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Lot of bikes, huh?
Yeah, good thing they got all these bike racks.
So are you gonna eat lunch tomorrow?
- Probably.
- Me too.
Maybe we can eat together.
Okay.
But won't people say that we're boyfriend-girlfriend?
Yeah, maybe.
Is that okay?
Yeah, I guess so.
You want this?
It's a friendship bracelet.
Oh, yeah, sure.
Thanks.
It's really neat.
Woo!
Way to go, D.J.
We have a boyfriend.
It's about time.
Okay, Grandpa, the name of the game is seven-card stud.
But this time, only sixes, nines, twos, kings and one-eyed jacks are wild.
- Bingo.
- Wrong game, Michelle.
Come on, guys.
You don't wanna be late.
Let's go.
- Okay.
- Okay.
So glad this isn't a rental.
Wow, you guys look so handsome.
Nah.
Okay, bye.
What's the big rush?
We have to wait for Rebecca.
D.J. doesn't want you to meet her new boyfriend, Michael.
Ooh.
I thought he was coming over to do homework.
Since when is he your boyfriend?
Since Tuesday at lunch.
Did you mention he also gave you a bracelet?
Ooh.
Dad, if it's Michael, promise you won't embarrass me.
Me?
Be Rebecca.
Be Rebecca.
Hi, Michael!
Let's go do our homework.
Hello, Michael.
I'm Mr. Tanner, D.J.'s father.
Dad.
- I'll get it.
- Come on, Michael, now's our chance.
Have mercy.
Wow, Jess, you cleaned up real nice.
All three of you.
You look so handsome.
: Nah.
Yeah.
- Come on, let's go.
- All right.
- See you later.
Bye-bye.
Bye.
Have fun.
- Bye!
See you later.
- Bye.
- Bye.
I'll see your two Flintstone stickers and raise you three Hello Kitty's.
I call.
Seven queens.
Beat that.
Seven aces.
Bingo.
- No way.
- Really.
- No way.
- I swear.
My dad was alive when Neil Armstrong walked on the moon.
- No way.
It's in our history book.
- He said.
Amazing.
Well, I gotta get home.
- So I'll see you at lunch tomorrow?
- I can't.
- Why not?
- I promised Kathy Santoni I'd sit with her tomorrow.
Kathy Santoni?
You can't eat lunch with Kathy Santoni.
Everybody will say you're boyfriend-girlfriend.
Maybe.
But I thought we were boyfriend-girlfriend.
Yeah, well, you're real nice and fun and smart but Kathy Santoni is so pretty.
Thanks for helping me with my homework.
I gotta go.
Hi, D.J. How come your boyfriend left so soon?
I don't have a boyfriend.
Uh-oh.
Did he dump you?
We broke up.
Just forget it.
I want to be alone.
Here's your sleeping bag.
Your pajamas and your pillow.
- Go sleep with Michelle.
- But-- But-- But-- Aren't you forgetting something?
How rude.
Number 12.
I'll remember that.
Wh-- Whoa, whoa!
I'll remember that.
See that?
That woman pinched me like a ripe tomato.
At least she noticed you.
I feel like I'm back in high school.
Nobody wants me.
I'm going to be totally humiliated.
I'll probably get a zit.
Come on, this is fun.
Now we know how women feel.
Let's go to the bathroom together.
Hi, guys.
Having a good time?
Is there any way I can get out of this fiasco?
Hi, I'm Crystal.

You're a little gift for my granddaughter.
Oh, Heather.
Hi.
He's cute.
Thanks, Grandma.
Yeah, thanks, Grandma.
And that brings us to bachelor number 12.
Wait a minute.
It seems that Danny has conveniently forgotten that he's bachelor number 11.
Ladies, Mr. Danny Tanner.
He's my cohost on Wake Up, San Francisco.
He's a barrel of fun, and look, he can change colors.
He's turning red before our eyes.

Sold for $150 to the lady with the bird on her hat.

- Oh, no, sweetie.
You're for me.
We're gonna boogie all night long.
I'll take a nap that day.
Okay, it's time now for bachelor number 12, Mr. Jesse Katsopolis.
Come on, Jesse.
Jesse is an up-and-coming advertising jingle writer, he's a musician-- Would you just get on with the bidding.
Right.
Do I have $100?
Ooh, stupid question.
Two hundred?
Three hundred?
I bid $1000.
- What do you think of that?
- A thousand dollars for a night with me?
No pressure there.
A thousand dollars, going once, going twice-- Eleven hundred!
Eleven hundred?
Twelve hundred.
Thirteen hundred.
Fourteen hundred.
Seventeen hundred dollars.
All right.
How about 1800?
Anybody?
Take him.
I could never explain $1800 to my husband.
Sold to Rebecca Donaldson for $1700.
- I can't believe Joey just did that.
- Hey, all you guys get sold?
Nick, I got a great girl.
I got her grandmother.
Well, I got Becky.
Pop, she paid 1700 bucks for me.
- What are you, nuts?
- That's what I said.
- Staple them.
- Okay.
Well, it was for a good cause and I. So, Nick, how are the kids?
Well, Steph had to sleep with Michelle because D.J. wanted to be alone.
Her boyfriend broke up with her.
- Oh, no.
- She must be crushed.
Her first broken heart.
This sounds like a job for Dad.
What should Dad say?
- You better take along junior dads.
- Junior dads.
- Junior dads.
- Junior dads.
You paid 1700 bucks for Jesse, huh?
I don't know if you're aware of this but you could have had him for free.
D.J.: Hi.
We heard what happened.
Did you have a fight?
No.
It's all because I'm not pretty.
- Oh.
- Come on.
That's not true.
I think you're very pretty.
You have to think that.
You're my dad.
Honey, did I ever tell you the story of The Ugly Duckling?
- Right, good story.
- Yeah, tell The Ugly Duckling story.
Ugly?
You guys think I'm ugly?
I just thought I wasn't pretty, now I'm ugly.
- Deej.
- D.J. - We don't think you're ugly.
- Yeah.
It's the duck that's ugly.
- The duck turns into a beautiful swan.
- I don't believe it.
You guys told her the story of The Ugly Duckling?
Yeah.
You never tell that story unless it's about some other kid.
Would you try talking to her?
Maybe D.J. needs a woman to talk to.
We should have told her Hansel and Gretel.
That's for kids in the woods, ding-dong.
- D.J.?
- Oh, good.
My room's open.
D.J.?
It's just Becky.
Do you wanna come out so we can talk?
Forgot my stuff.
Come on, sweetheart, let's go in your room.
Sorry, Mr. Bear.
You've had a rough night.
Becky, there's nothing to talk about.
I'm ugly, boys don't like me and that's it.
D.J., that's not true.
You happen to be a very pretty girl.
But I know how you feel.
When I was in the seventh grade, I had the biggest crush on Sven Anderson.
But he liked blonds, so I got a big bottle of peroxide.
- Did it work?
- Hmm, it turned my hair orange.
I looked like Howdy Doody in a miniskirt.
Howdy who?
Anyway, my mother said: "Don't you worry about what a boyfriend or anybody else thinks of you.
You just be the best Becky you can be".
Then she made me stand there and list all my good points.
You're not gonna make me do that, are you?
Yes, I am.
Now, go on, try it.
Well I'm pretty good at school.
I have a lot of friends.
I have a purple belt in karate.
I'm nice to animals.
I have great hair.
You see?
You know what?
Those are just a few of the wonderful things about you.
Deej, that boy blew it.
You are the best.
- Thanks, Becky.
- You're welcome.
Do you think I'll ever have another boyfriend?
Oh, you'll have lots of boyfriends.
And some will break your heart and if I'm not mistaken, you'll probably break a few hearts yourself.
It'll be great.
And then someday when you least expect it you'll meet that one special guy and before you know it you'll be paying $1700 to go out on a date with him.
- I don't understand.
- Neither do I. - But you're feeling better?
- Yeah, I guess.
- Good.
- Becky?
Would it be all right if I called you sometime to talk about girl stuff?
- Any time you want.
- Thanks.
You're welcome.
You go on, I'll handle this.
- Is D.J. okay?
- Yeah, she's feeling better.
She just needed a little girl talk.
- Thanks for the help.
- You're welcome.
I'll go say good night.
They should put a warning label on the Ugly Duckling story.
- Some hot chocolate, Beck?
- Sure.
- Jess, we have to talk.
- I know.
Look, um, I'm not gonna hold you to this date thing.
I mean, I know I've asked you out a few times, actually several times and you've made it clear your career comes first - and you just wanna be friends-- - Jesse, I know-- I know what happened.
The excitement, everybody bidding and you had money-- Jesse-- To be honest.
Oh, boy.
Tonight, when Crystal was about to win that date with you something happened to me.
I was, uh.
A little jealous?
I wanted to claw her eyes out.
Really?
Uh-huh.
Hmm.
Jesse, I know what I said before but I think maybe now we should go out.
I mean, who knows, maybe this could turn into something.
Or maybe it won't or maybe it already has or maybe you should just shut me up.
Okay.
Okay, come on.
Have mercy.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Okay, Michelle.
I'm putting my act together for tonight.
What's your favorite impression?
Jay Leno?
So have you seen this in the paper?
Now, this is ridiculous.
This never seems to happen to you or I. It always seem to happen to those two wacky brothers living in Idaho.
Is it Rodney Dangerfield?
Oh, boy, I get no respect.
Michelle, you know, when I was a baby my parents used to save the dirty diapers and throw me away.
You don't know comedy when you see it.
No respect.
No respect?
Me funny.
You funny?
You little monster.
Kiss.
Michelle, that smells delicious.
- What are you making?
- Eggs.
Eggs.
Oh, look, and you prepared them my favorite way polyvinyl-side up.
Daddy, can you make French toast for breakfast?
Dad, don't listen to her.
Waffles, waffles, waffles.
- French toast.
- Waffles.
Hey, hold it!
We'll go to the tie-breaker.
Michelle, you want French toast or waffles?
Cookies.
I can live with that.
Jess, you better check the expiration date on that mousse.
I've never seen anyone look so wiped out.
Joseph, we did it.
We stayed up all night, but finally finished that jingle.
Yeah, that sunrise was real inspiring.
Good morning.
I'm here for the weekend.
They're just kidding.
Kimmy, we're gonna have so much fun.
I'll get it.
Thanks for letting me stay, Mr. Tanner.
Don't forget, I'm allergic to dairy products feather pillows and 6-year-olds.
Don't look at me, I'm 6 and three quarters.
Your parents are coming back Sunday?
Absolutely.
Wednesday at the latest.
Who wants to chip in for a hotel?
- Joey?
- Cheryl.
Are you the same Joey I've been dating for two months?
No, I'm Joey's grungy twin brother, Sloppy Joe.
Let me go get Handsome Joe.
Hold on.
I'm just on my way to the gym and I thought I'd stop by and see if maybe you wanna go skiing.
Really?
You wanna go away with me knowing this could happen again tomorrow morning?
Well, you haven't seen my evil twin yet.
No-makeup Cheryl.
I'll pick you up around 5.
Strawberry jelly donut.
I'll pick up a dozen for the weekend.
- Bye, Joey.
- Bye.
- See you.
- Bye.
All right.
- What are you doing?
- The Loco-Motion.
- Where did you get this tape?
- It was in there.
Oh, no.
Please tell me you didn't tape over my Casa de Pancakes jingle.
- What are you doing?
- The Loco-Motion.
I can't believe it, it's gone.
You guys destroyed it!
I have to do the whole thing again.
Not the whole thing.
You've still got: This is my room.
You have no right being in here without my permission.
- But-- - No buts.
- But-- - What did I just say?
How much does it take to check a tape before you record over it?
Why don't you just get out of here before I get mad.
Before?
Look, I'm really sorry.
It was an accident.
But you don't have to worry, I'll never come in here again.
- What happened?
- They messed up my jingle tape.
Joey's going away, I'll have to do this whole thing over again.
- Don't you think you're overreacting?
- Overreacting?
You think I'm overreacting?
I'm not overreacting!
I spent the whole night working this out now my whole life is ruined!
Okay, now I'm overreacting.
Jess you lost your temper again, huh?
Well, she shouldn't be in here-- I'm just tired.
I lost my cool.
I did come down on her pretty hard, didn't I?
- She'll be okay?
- I think you better straighten this out.
Yeah, all right.
- I know just how to handle this.
- Good.
Jesse.
Do you need a hug?
Haven't I been through enough?
Hi, Michelle.
What a day.
D.J. was playing all day with Kimmy Gibble-burger.
I don't believe I'm gonna say this but would you play with me?
No.
Please.
Pretty please.
I'll play anything you want.
Horsy.
Okay, hop on.
Go horsy.
Come on.
Mr. Bear, I can't believe I've sunk this low.
Deej, I need to see you downstairs!
What'd I do now?
You didn't do anything.
I got a fun surprise for you.
Be careful.
It could be a trick.
It's not a trick.
"Harry Levin Trio"?
Well, I got a good deal.
Harry's going back in the deli business.
Deej, they're for you.
For me?
Why?
Well, I just wanted to make sure we're buddies.
- We cool now?
- Yeah, I guess.
All right, this is great.
Thanks for the skins, bud.
Okay, give them a try, Deej.
Okay.
How am I doing?
Well, you're facing the right direction.
Here, let me show you.
I played a little in junior high school.
See if I remember anything.
Well, see, what you do is you start off with the bass drum like this.
Then you add the snare.
Then you add the high-hat.
And before long, you get this: Hey, what a welcome.
Look, we got drums.
No, we got drums.
No, I got drums.
- Come on, we better get to Tahoe.
- Better hurry up.
- The fog is really getting thick.
- How thick is it?
Well, I wouldn't say it's as thick as pea soup but people are throwing croutons out their windows.
And now let's have a big round of applause for the Harry Levin Trio.
Thank you.
You're a nutty guy.
Thanks very much.
Thank you, boys.
Don't forget to turn off the bubble machine.
Bye.
- How you doing, Pop?
- Hey.
- Hey, Jess.
Looking good.
- You too.
Thanks.
- How's it going, daddy-o?
- Everything is great.
I thought I'd find you here.
Girls, your grandpa's moving in forever.
- Give Grandma a hug.
- Hi, Grandma.
- What'd you do this time?
- Well, I simply suggested that she spend a little less time at night school and concentrate on her domestic responsibilities.
His exact words were: "Yo, Irene, drop out of that flaky college, come home and make me dinner".
- I don't talk like that.
First place-- - That's just what you-- There's kids in the room.
D.J., I didn't know you could play the drums.
I can't.
Listen.
Oh, no.
That racket is coming from my house.
Dad, Uncle Jesse bought me these drums.
Oh, did he really?
Oh, good old Uncle J. Uncle J., could I see you in the K?
Right away?
Why, yes, you may.
When can I have a turn?
Right after I get good at this.
So I guess the answer is never.
Drums?
Did I do something to you?
Come on, Danny, every kid in America wants a set of drums.
Good.
Then we'll have no trouble selling them.
Will you please stop that drumming?
Oh, sorry.
What possessed you to buy her drums?
Well, I felt bad about yelling at her, so I thought I'd buy her something to kind of make things better.
That's how you solve problems?
You buy the kid off?
It worked.
She loves the drums.
She loves me.
What's your problem?
My problem is, instead of talking to D.J you went out and bought her the world's most obnoxious gift.
A thousand apologies for bringing the joy of music into a young girl's life.
- Jesse-- - No, don't worry.
I'll handle this.
Deej I got bad news.
Your dad doesn't want you to have the drums.
But Dad, they're a present from Uncle Jesse.
- That's not fair.
- Thanks, Jess.
Now I'm the bad guy.
Come on, Danny, let the kid have a drum.
Nick, I think you should let them work it out.
Now that I live here, I should be involved.
You live here now?
Nick will tell you all about it.
Then you can call me at home, and I'll tell you what really happened.
- Goodbye, everybody.
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye, Grandma.
- Bye-bye.
She'll be back.
- I'm back.
- Did I call it?
I am back because the fog is so thick I couldn't see the steps.
Looks like you're moving in too, huh, Ma?
Well, isn't this great?
Here we are, all fogged in together.
One big, happy family.
And, of course, the Harry Levin Trio.
Dad, did you decide about my drums yet?
No, honey.
I wanna sleep on it.
Isn't it more comfortable to sleep on your bed?
- Came to say good night.
- Good night, Grandpa.
Night, Danny.
Good night, honey.
Okay, good night.
- Good night, honey.
- Good night, honey.
- Good night.
- I'll be sleeping in Joey's room in case anybody wants to beg for forgiveness.
- Good night, kids.
- Good night, Grandma.
- Good night.
- Good night, Grandpa.
Okay, everybody in bed.
Dad, how come everybody's mad tonight?
Maybe it's because Kimmy Gibbler's here.
I don't think so.
Maybe.
"I meant what I said and I said what I meant.
An elephant's faithful 100 percent".
Look at that elephant.
Look at that elephant.
Hi.
- Just came in to check on Michelle.
- Don't worry.
I didn't buy her a thing.
So, Michelle, where were we?
Oh, yes.
So.
The nice handsome prince with great hair gave the young princess a magical, musical gift.
Just then the tall, geeky giant came in and took the gift away.
The princess was so sad and that, Michelle, was the day the music died.
Give me my kid.
Geeky giant.
Geeky giant.
Yeah, Michelle, that was my favorite part too.
Give me a kiss.
Give me a kiss.
Let me tell you the real story.
Once upon a time the tall and lean and elegant prince from the Land of Wisdom came to save the princess from the hotheaded troubadour who spent way too much time on his hair.
Geeky giant.
Does she snore that loud because she has all that air in her head?
This is so weird.
She never snores when she's sleeping in class.
Let's get her out of here.
Come on, Kimmy.
Get up.
It's time for your sleep walk.
Come on.
Come on.
I pity the fool who marries this woman.
- Let's go, Kimmy.
Come on.
- Come on.
Come on, Kimmy.
Let's go visit your new bed.
- Why?
- Because you snore like a garbage truck.
Look, Kimmy, here's your new bed.
Snore your head off.
Now you're Michelle's problem.
Oh, no.
Sorry we never made it out of town.
Yeah, me too.
At least that fog cleared up a little or we'd still be driving around that Kmart parking lot.
- Good night.
- Night.
Irene?
That you?
Hello, sweetheart.
You wanna kiss and make up?
I don't know.
First college, now this?
What's going on?
Oh, my God.
Mom.
- What's going on here?
- Nick.
Never in a million, billion years would I be in here with your wife.
What's wrong with his wife?
Nothing.
You're a very attractive woman.
Hey, back off, man.
That's my mommy you're talking about.
- Sorry.
- Here, put a robe on.
Nobody wants to see this.
Nick, your wife shouldn't be sleeping alone.
She loves to cuddle.
All right, now that you're both awake sit down and settle this problem.
Hey, all right, I'm sorry I lost my temper.
First thing in the morning we'll go to that shop you like buy you a brand-new outfit.
Nick, you can't just buy me a new outfit and expect everything to be all better.
You're right.
I'll throw in a pair of shoes.
Help me here.
Pop, she wants to talk about the problem.
She doesn't want you to buy her gifts.
You can't just buy-- - Oh, boy.
- What's the matter?
The geeky giant was right.
I did the same thing with D.J. that you're doing with Mom.
Pop, I got a lot of great things from you.
I got your pride, your ambition your hair.
Thank you, by the way.
But I also got your temper.
And let's face it.
It gets us in a lot of trouble, doesn't it?
Are you two ready to really talk to each other?
When you say "you two" you really mean me.
I think we can do better, Pop.
- Yeah, you're right, Jess.
- Good.
Because this fog is gonna lift and frankly, Father, you can't live here.
That's my boy.
About this drum thing, I'm sorry.
I was wrong, and you were right.
Thanks, Jess.
What's going on down there?
D.J., what are you doing up?
Well, first it was Kimmy snoring, and then there was a loud crash then people screaming.
This time I was on my way back from the bathroom.
Can you come down here?
I wanna talk to you.
- Now?
- Jess, it's 3:00 in the morning.
- Can't it wait?
- I just wanna tell her - that I was wrong, and you were right.
- D.J., get down here.
Come on, honey.
Uncle Jesse needs to talk to you right away.
Dad, can I keep my drum set?
- Yes, you can keep the drums.
- All right.
But the sticks have gotta go.
D.J. I should have talked to you today about our fight instead of buying you a big gift.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
You know, kid people have things they don't like about themselves and.
Well, me, I have my temper.
And sometimes I say things the wrong way and I hurt the people that I love.
I don't blame you for being mad at me.
I did tape over your pancake jingle.
But I didn't handle it right.
I embarrassed you in front of your friend, I hurt your feelings and then I tried to buy your forgiveness.
That was wrong.
You know what I'm saying?
Kind of.
Maybe this will help you.
When I was a kid and I did something wrong my dad would blow his top and send me to my room.
A couple hours later, he'd come back with a Batman comic book.
And that's how I knew everything was okay.
But we never.
We never talked about the problem.
You know, we never talked about our feelings, the way I felt.
I don't want that to happen to you and me.
I want our relationship to be better than that.
I think we're doing pretty good.
You ain't seen nothing yet, kid.
When I was your age, I used to get in so much trouble.
I remember this one time I was playing football and Pop was watching TV.
His favorite show, The Beverly Hillbillies.
I kicked a field goal right through Jethro's face.
He yelled at me all night long.
He had nothing better to do, the TV was busted.
Anyway, kid, the point that I'm trying to make here is.
D.J.?
D.J.?
And they lived happily ever after.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
All right.
Way to go, Michelle.
What an athlete.
D.J., what's the big deal?
We're holding her hands.
I'm building her confidence.
This is a waste of time.
She's 2 years old.
I didn't skate till I was 4.
Well?
She's lying about her age.
Joseph, Joseph, Joseph.
We need something to give this jingle some pizzazz, you know?
Sammy.
We'll both do it.
We'll give them a Sammy double whammy.
That's good thinking, man.
Kind of a dueling Sammy.
- Shop fast - Shop smart - Shop around the clock at - Hurry-Mart - And I mean that, babe - And I mean that, babe It loses it without the real Sammy.
We gotta have this thing done by tomorrow.
How long before the girls come home?
Well, at the stroke of 3, we turn back into housewives.
All right, quick.
What comes to your mind when I say "24-hour convenience store"?
Six dollars for a loaf of bread.
That's not a catchy jingle.
All right, think.
Now, Hurry-Mart has everything you need on your way home.
- Kind of like the old general store.
- Yes-- That's it.
That's it.
"Hurry-Mart: The Great American General Store".
I love it.
Kind of like a "Little Mini-Mart on the Prairie".
If you will, yes.
All right, how much time do we have left?
- Hi.
- None.
Uncle Jesse, it's your day to drive the Honeybee carpool.
We can't "bee" late.
I'm ready to buzz out of here.
- Joey, will you help me with my karate?
- Sure.
Go for it.
I pity the guy who tries to attack you with a pencil.
Uncle Jesse, will you teach me an Elvis song for the Honeybee talent show?
I'd be happy to help you out, little mama.
Thank you very much.
You're beautiful, uncle.
No, get the Honey collar up, get the lip up.
Go ahead.
Try it again.
Thank you very much.
You're beautiful, uncle.
- Come on, phone, ring.
- Ring.
- Ring.
- Ring.
- Ring.
- Ring.
Not you, the telephone, huh?
Well, I finally cleaned under my bed.
Joey, the ad agency was supposed to call at 1:30.
It is now 1:32.
They must've hated our jingle.
Relax, it's obvious what happened.
They liked it so much they threw a party and lost all track of time.
What's obvious is, when you were a baby somebody played the bongos on your soft spot.
You live in a dream world.
Give me a hand with these.
They're heavy.
All right, hurry up, now.
Michelle, take a walk with us.
She locked us out.
Come on, Michelle.
Open the door.
- Turn the little thingy on the handle.
- Come on.
This is not funny.
Open the door.
Get the phone.
Hi, man.
Michelle, it's the ad agency.
Take a message.
Grab a pencil on the desk.
Oh, and I live in a dream world?
Joey, bye-bye.
No.
Joey, here-here.
Bye, man.
- Michelle.
- She's going to the front door.
- Michelle!
- Michelle!
Hi, Michelle.
Where's Joey and Uncle Jesse?
Patio.
- When did you learn to say "patio"?
- Sunday.
- When did you learn to say "Sunday"?
- Monday.
- Michelle!
- Michelle!
Come on, please open the door.
If you open, I'll give you a cookie and a kiss.
- Yes.
- Where's my kiss and cookie?
I'll get the cookie.
I'll get it.
Hello.
Mr. Malatesta.
You just called?
We gotta get a new answering service.
- They bought our jingle, Joseph!
- Yes!
All right!
That's awfully good news, sir.
Okay.
Great.
We'll be down there.
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, sir.
All right, Joseph, go get ready.
Somebody still owes me a kiss.
Thanks.
I was hoping it would be you.
There they are.
Very fine work, gentlemen.
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, Mr. Malatesta.
- You really liked our jingle?
- No, I like my wife.
I love the jingle.
It's so catchy.
Hurry-Mart - The Great American General Store - Yeah.
How would you guys like to take that jingle and turn it into a whole campaign?
You want us to do a whole commercial?
The dialogue, concept, the whole deal?
Exactly.
I want this commercial to be the best you've ever come up with.
No problem there.
We've never come up with one before.
I have faith in you guys.
You've sold us three jingles in a row.
If you do well on this one I'm gonna offer you a full-time job.
- Great.
- Thank you, sir.
Come on, Joseph.
We'll be back next week with brilliance.
No, no, wait.
We've got a presentation to put together.
We pitch it to the client tomorrow.
Pitch it to the-- Come on, guys.
Right this way.
Right over here.
- Make yourselves at home.
- Thank you.
Come on.
Yes.
- You like the office?
- No, we like your wife.
We love the office.
You like-- What's with this guy?
Yeah, don't worry, Jesse.
I'll cover for you with the girls.
Dad, could you raise it a little higher?
Honey, I'll be off the phone in a minute.
Just practice your scary faces.
So, hey, Jess, if you guys get stuck and need any help with funny ideas for your commercial, I could-- Hello?
Hello?
Where's Uncle Jesse?
He's supposed to teach me an Elvis song for the Honeybee talent show.
Girls, Uncle Jesse and Joey are stuck at work.
But the Honeybee talent show is tomorrow.
I don't know whether to curl my hips or wiggle my lips or what.
And tomorrow's my test for my green belt.
I need help with my karate.
Nobody panic.
I am gonna teach you how to do Elvis and I'm gonna teach you how to do karate.
Because Elvis did karate.
Watch this.
Thank you very much.
That was Elvis?
Yeah.
Presley?
Dad, are you okay?
Too much Elvis.
I'm down at the end of Backache Street, at Bengay Hotel.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Hello.
- Sorry we're home so late.
That's okay, Dad helped me practice my karate.
And he taught me to do Elvis.
Presley?
Just taking care of business.
- How was your day at work?
- The boss loved our ideas.
Tomorrow we're gonna pitch our commercial to the client.
If they like it and everything goes well, we got a shot at a full-time job.
That's great.
Isn't that great, girls?
- I think so.
- I guess.
Sure it is.
- Good night, girls.
- Good night.
You know, this is so amazing.
When you guys moved in here, you didn't even like each other.
And now you might be working together full-time.
This is one of the happiest days of my life.
Pretty sad, isn't it?
- Go to bed, girls.
- Okay.
Do you think they're really gonna get a full-time job?
It sounds like it to me.
They were pretty excited.
But if Uncle Jesse, Joey and Daddy are all working who's gonna take care of us?
All right, everything is perfect.
Joseph, we've come up with a great campaign.
Just think about it, pal.
Any moment, our future's gonna come walking through that door.
Hi, people.
Michelle.
Michelle, where's Grandma?
She's here.
She just can't walk as fast as a 2-year-old.
What are you doing here?
I'm dropping the baby off like we agreed.
The client is running late.
Can you watch her a little longer, please?
No, I'm sorry, I gotta get to school.
- What a gorgeous office.
- Mother?
- You boys are becoming so successful.
- Thank you.
I remember when Jesse was just a little pumpkin running around in his diapers.
He had the cutest little tushy.
Mother, please, you do this every time I get a new job.
Do not grab my tushy at work.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Okay.
Joey, they're coming.
Do something with the kid.
Look.
Here, Michelle, let's play a little game of hide-and-seek.
You go under the desk and hide, and at some point in the near future - we'll come and seek you.
- Right.
Okay.
Here we go, here we go, here we go.
Here we go, here we go.
- Ad boys.
- Good.
Gladstone, Katsopolis I'd like to introduce the vice president of marketing for Hurry-Mart, Edna Foley.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Hi.
Hi, sorry, I'm late.
- Gentlemen, it's all yours.
- Thank you.
All right.
Edna, our goal here is to get people to associate Hurry-Mart with traditional American values.
Our story begins with a typical American family, the Applebys.
They're taking a drive in their station wagon.
You see Dad.
Hi there.
- Mom.
- Hi.
- Little Timmy.
- Party, dude.
Sister Susie.
And, of course, lovable Scruffy.
Down, Scruffy.
Up ahead, a modern Hurry-Mart magically becomes the old general store.
The friendly clerk greets them at the door.
He looks like your grandpa.
- Grandpapa.
- Right.
Dagnab it, Pepino, look, it's the Applebys.
Howdy, folks.
Inside, the Applebys go shopping.
And.
The little kids run around.
See, there they are, running around.
They're running.
Little kids are good little runners, aren't they?
They run.
They run.
- Help me out, Joseph.
- Look at those Applebys go.
The family is driving away, waving goodbye to the friendly clerk.
Even Scruffy barks "so long".
Moo.
"Moo"?
A stray cow wanders by.
See?
See?
A stray cow wanders by.
And as we bid a fond farewell to the Applebys and that unexpected, yet adorable little cow, we hear: Hurry-Mart The Great American General Store I'm not sure how the cow fits in - but I love the concept.
- All right.
Dagnab it, Malatesta, you got yourself a new account.
- Wonderful.
- And you better make sure these two - are working on it.
- Are you kidding?
These are my boys.
In fact, they just went to work for me full-time.
- Smart move.
- Congratulations!
Come on, guys.
We've got a strategy meeting to go to.
You can put the stray cow back in her barn.
Mr. Malatesta, there's something you should know.
This is not a stray cow.
Joey and I have a baby.
Hey, your personal lives are none of my business.
Dagnab it.
Joseph, a toast to our new careers.
This is the last time I buy champagne in a can.
Oh, you're back.
You guys missed a major banner Tanner day.
I'd like to present San Francisco's newest green belt our own karate kid, D.J. Tanner.
- Show them some moves.
- Dad.
Come on, Deej, I spent a fortune on karate lessons.
Give them a little: Well, with no further ado, the winner of the Golden Hive Award for Talent the queen bee of rock and roll.
Thank you, boys.
I'm gonna buy every one of you a Cadillac.
Steph, you look great.
How'd you do?
I was a hunk, a hunk of burning love.
We're very sorry we missed you girls today.
That's all right.
I explained you had to work late again.
But good news.
- I got it all on tape.
- Great.
Joseph and I have a piece of good news ourselves.
We landed a full-time job today.
That's great!
Way to go.
- Aren't you girls happy for us?
- Come on, girls, where's our hug?
This family hugs when the mail comes.
How can you guys do this?
Yeah, what's gonna happen to us?
We're gonna be all alone.
Girls you know you're always gonna be taken care of.
This job is a big chance for Joey and Uncle Jesse.
Think of all the things they've done for you.
And not because they had to, but just because they love you.
We're not gonna leave you, girls.
We'll still see you every morning before school.
- That's right.
And every day after work.
- And every weekend.
All federal holidays.
- But it won't be the same.
- You guys missed today.
You missed everything yesterday.
Now, you're gonna miss the whole rest of our lives.
And we'd miss you so much.
All right, maybe there were a few things we didn't consider when we took this job.
All right, Jess.
Red checkers are reasons to keep the job black checkers are reasons to quit.
One major black checker is we get a lot of great things out of raising these kids.
I never thought I'd say this before, but I dig being Mr. Mom.
I never thought I'd say this, but I think you look smashing in an apron.
All right.
Missing the girls is one good reason not to keep the job.
On the other hand, the job pays more money than we've ever seen in our lives and that is a major red checker.
We wouldn't just be writing jingles.
We'll come up with whole commercial campaigns.
That's a big step up.
Plus, we like what we do.
All right, red checker.
And it did feel great sitting in that big office, being out in the real world.
- King me.
- You got it.
- Well, it looks like we're going to work.
- I guess so.
Joseph, there's one thing I'm forgetting.
My music.
I mean, if we took this job there wouldn't be any time to write or play gigs.
That's a major part of my life.
Stack a black.
And, hey, I'd have no time to work on my comedy.
I mean, what good would this Bullwinkle voice be at the office?
Black checker.
All right, Joseph, really think about this.
Now, are we?
Are we ready to give up our dreams?
- I don't want to.
- Neither do I. But you have to admit we've had more success in three months of advertising than of all those years in music and comedy.
- Red checker.
- Red checker.
Oh, boy.
You know, Jess, life is like a salad bar.
You have all these great choices but you can't help but think to yourself: "How often are they changing those beets"?
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.
Somebody wants to say good night.
- Say "Good night, Joey".
- Night, Joey.
Night-night, Michelle.
Oh, I love you, Michelle.
Black checker.
Say "Night-night, Jesse".
- Night-night, Jesse.
- Night, Michelle.
Guys, I swear I didn't do this to make you feel guilty.
She really wanted to say good night.
Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Oh, boy.
- You wanna see me about something?
- Yes, sir.
Sir, Jesse and I are having some second thoughts.
Let me ask you something.
Our job is to sit down and come up with brilliant ideas, right?
So it wouldn't matter where we're sitting when we come up with these ideas, right?
Is this a trick question?
No, no, no.
The point is that it doesn't really matter where we're sitting.
Okay, yeah, it was a trick question.
Joey.
Sir, it would solve a lot of our problems if we could work at home.
- Work at home?
- Yes.
Jesse and I have some dreams that we're not ready to give up yet.
And we have these kids we'd really miss.
Oh, right.
The stray cow.
Well, I suppose I could hire you on a project-by-project basis.
It's a little unusual, but if working at home makes you happy.
Although it would be inconvenient for me.
I guess it'd be best for everyone concerned if you guys got out of here.
To go home and go to work.
I love you guys.
It's a deal.
I got you.
Did you see your face?
Surprise!
Mr. Malatesta, these are our kids, and this is Danny-- Remember, your personal lives are none of my business.
We brought plants for your new office.
All right, pack them in the car and take them home.
That's where we're working from now on.
All right!
Did you guys quit your jobs for us?
We didn't quit.
We arranged it so we could work at home.
Daddy, can you do your TV show at home?
No, honey.
All those crew people would scuff up our floors.
Unfortunately, most parents' jobs aren't that flexible.
Before we go home, you gotta check out this view.
Yeah.
Come here.
Let's see if we can find our house.
- Come on, Michelle.
It's out there.
- Okay, wait.
- Come on, Michelle.
- Wouldn't it be over there?
- It's great.
Wait till you see this.
- To your left.
- Michelle.
- Michelle.
- Michelle, open the door.
- Michelle.
- Come on, open the door.
- Open the door, Michelle.
Michelle, please.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
What are you doing eating with your hands?
Someday you're gonna be invited to the White House to eat fruit cocktail with the president and if you eat with your fingers there's a chance you'll gross out the commander in chief.
Now, you eat with a spoon, all right?
No, thank you.
No, thank you?
Michelle, grab that spoon and eat.
Okay, but you're on your own when the soup comes, young lady.
I see you.
I see that you're sneaking one with your hands.
I see you.
- And here's a valentine for my teacher.
- Okay, tongue out.
Thank you.
Hurry up, Steph.
Michelle's drying up.
What do I do about Wendell Berman's valentine?
I can't sign, "Love, Stephanie" to someone who has his finger in his nose all day.
Well, why don't you just put, "From Stephanie, to Wendell" and just throw in a little piece of Kleenex?
Good thinking.
My funny valentine - Happy Valentine's Day, girls!
- Happy Valentine's Day.
- Joey, you like these earrings?
- Oh, Jess, they are beautiful.
I'll get my ears pierced tomorrow.
They're not for you, huh?
They're for Becky.
It's our very first Valentine's.
It's part of my Valentine's dream night.
Check these out, girls.
Ooh.
- Uncle Jesse, are you in love?
- Well, Becky and I-- Well, let me see, how do I say this?
But the two of-- If you-- - Okay, if you see both of us toge-- - He's babbling.
It's love.
Happy Valentine's Day, girls.
All right, Dad!
Fashion Central.
You got my royal blue sweater.
I don't know anything about a royal blue sweater.
Guys, know anything about a blue sweater?
- Nope.
Nothing.
- No way.
Yes, you do.
I started hinting for it the day after Christmas.
Could we please open our presents right now?
- Pretty please?
- Pretty please.
Pretty please.
Oh, no.
The triple leg hug "pretty please".
Happy Valentine's Day!
Well, these are from all three of us.
D.J., this is for you.
- Thank you.
- And, Steph, this is for you.
And come here, Michelle, this one's for you.
All right.
- A gold heart.
It's so pretty.
Thank you.
- Yeah, well, look.
It's a locket.
You open it up and there's pictures inside.
Who are these people?
They're Bill and Mary, they come with every new picture frame and wallet.
And now, the moment we've all been waiting for.
Well, I've been waiting for.
Oh, thank you for my royal blue socks.
Won't those royal blue socks go fabulous with your new royal blue sweater?
- Oh, my God.
Thank you, thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.
- I told you.
Thank you, Daddy.
No, no, Michelle.
No, there's more.
No, keep digging.
You know, this would make a great dress if I put a belt on it.
I'm gonna belt you, you little nerdbomber.
Take it off right now.
- Hey, D.J., be cool.
- No, look, she's stretching it out.
You don't have to yell at me.
I've got ears.
But you've got nothing between them, you little chicken wing.
Oh, yeah?
Well, if I'm a chicken wing then you're a double-decker lame-oid chicken sandwich.
You're lucky to have a sister.
Say something nice about each other.
Okay.
Stephanie, you have a wonderful big sister.
And, D.J., you have an even more wonderful little sister.
Yes, I do.
Her name's Michelle.
Dad, is it okay if I wear my new sweater to school?
- Sure, honey.
But take good care of it.
- I will.
Help.
Let's help her open it before she outgrows it.
- Here, come on.
Rip that off.
- What is it?
What is it?
Here we go.
- Pretty.
- Happy Valentine's Day, Michelle.
Thank you.
I say next year we just get the kid a box.
And, Mr. Bear, this one's from Jason Fleming.
And this one's from Jason Greenblatt.
And this one's from Jason Yamagato.
And this one's from Wendell Berman.
- D.J., what's wrong?
- Don't ask.
It's too late.
I already asked.
Hey, where's your new sweater?
Right here.
And here.
And here.
What happened?
Did it blow up?
I was so stupid.
I was playing soccer at recess and I took my sweater off so it wouldn't get all sweaty.
Next thing I know, the gardener drives his stupid lawn mower right over my sweater.
Daddy is gonna freak out.
Not if my plan works.
Have no fear.
Kimmy Gibbler's here.
If she's part of your plan, you need a new plan.
No, I need a new sweater.
My plan is to go back to the store and buy one.
Here's $11.80.
It's all the money I have.
Oh, Kimmy, you're the best friend in the whole world.
Okay, here's the other $5.
Well, I have $27 in my "I gotta get a car the day I turn 16" fund.
You can have all the money in my piggy bank too.
- Great.
- Just turn around and shut your eyes.
It's in my secret hiding place.
Steph, we're in a hurry.
Just get it out of the toy chest and let's go.
That's the old secret hiding place.
I don't keep it there anymore.
Just turn around and shut your eyes.
Thanks for the ride, Joey.
We'll be done in about 10 minutes.
I'll go down to the one-hour photo store and watch people's vacations go by.
- Bye, girls.
- Bye.
Oh, here it is.
It's so pretty, it's so perfect, it's so in one piece, it's so-- - Eighty dollars?
- Hi.
May I help you, girls?
Yes.
By any chance would this sweater be going on sale soon?
Like in the next 10 minutes?
- No, I'm sorry.
- Well, we only have $43.80.
Plus.
Three hundred and twenty-two pennies in cash.
I'm sorry, you're a little short.
I can't help it.
I'm only 6.
That's it.
I'm gonna have to tell Joey, Uncle Jesse and Dad that I turned their Valentine's Day present into $80 worth of royal blue dishrags.
That's too bad.
But as long as we're here, let's try stuff on.
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- Yes?
Is this sign true?
I can buy something now and pay for it later?
Why, yes.
People buy now and pay later all the time.
It's called credit.
Hear that, Mr. Bear?
I can buy D.J. the sweater now and when I save up enough money I can pay for it later.
- Come on, Steph.
Let's go find Joey.
- Okay.
Oh, excuse me, ma'am, I need to look inside your bag.
I hate shoplifters.
They drive up the prices for everyone.
- Thanks for the ride, Joey.
- You're welcome.
I'm still amazed the three of you went into a mall for 20 minutes and not one of you bought a thing.
We were practicing our browsing.
You know, Kimmy, one day you're gonna make a lucky young man very confused.
Great.
How am I gonna tell everybody about the sweater?
You don't have to.
Ta da!
Stephanie, how'd you pay for that sweater?
I didn't have to.
The lady said I could buy now and pay later.
So I took it for you.
You're welcome.
Oh, Stephanie.
- What's wrong?
- You ripped it off.
No, I didn't.
It's wrong to steal.
Look, Stephanie, I know you were trying to help me but you took the sweater without paying.
That's called credit.
Well, if you don't have a credit card, it's called shoplifting.
- It is?
- I gotta get out of here.
If the police ever connect me with this crime I might be banned from the mall forever.
I'm a criminal?
I broke the law?
D.J., I'm scared.
I don't want to go to jail.
Am I gonna go to prison?
Steph, don't panic.
You're not gonna go to jail.
Look, all we have to do is return the sweater tomorrow and everything will be just fine.
Just calm down.
I feel much better.
Let's go, valentines.
We've got a date tonight.
Oh, D.J., wear your new sweater.
I can't wait to see how it looks on you.
Now what do we do?
Well, if I wear the stolen sweater to dinner and return it tomorrow at least I won't ruin everyone's Valentine's Day.
I'd ruin tomorrow instead.
You have such a good heart.
Now, all I have to do is get this plastic alarm thingy off.
Ugh, it won't come off.
That's all right.
I think it looks nice.
There's gotta be a way to hide it.
Come on, girls, let's go.
Ahoy, land lover.
I'm setting sail for me Valentine costume party.
Does you have any spinach in a can?
This frozen stuff shivers me timbers.
I thought you were to go as a famous romantic couple.
- What happened to Cheryl?
- Oh, Olive Oyl.
It's your Romeo.
Oh, hi, Popeye.
No, wait.
Cheryl, it's more like, "Oh, Popeye.
My hero".
Oh, Popeye.
My hero!
We'll work on it.
Well, I'll work on my voice and you work on these muscles.
And she's got a little smart mouth on her, it's gonna be.
All right, now, where's that little Swee'pea?
Oh, Swee'pea.
Oh, Michelle, come here.
That's how you looked the day you were born.
Oh, gosh, how adorable.
Hi, Popeye.
Here you go.
Danny, I wish you was coming with me.
Now that I takes a good looks at you you're built more like Olive Oyl than Cheryl is.
Come on, Olive.
Let's go before my forearms explode.
Come on, girls.
Let's go.
Daddy, your dates are ready.
Girls, why are your sweaters rolled up on the side?
It's the latest style.
Pretty cool, huh?
- Try it, Daddy.
- Hey.
If anyone's ready to take a fashion risk, it's your rad dad.
Oh, bless you.
Jesse took me on a hayride through the streets of San Francisco.
It was so romantic.
The stars twinkling, the city lights shining Jesse sneezing.
A little allergy to the hay.
Well, we're off to see Roger Rabbit for the fifth time.
- Come on, girls.
- Bye, guys.
- Bye, girls.
Have fun.
- You too.
Danny, what's with the sweater?
It's the latest style, dude.
Yeah.
There's a look I don't wanna know better.
- Boy, you really went all out tonight.
- Oh, you ain't seen nothing yet, kid.
First, a little language of love some mÃºsica.
Next some fire to heat up the evening a little.
As if we needed it.
And now, a little toast.
Here we are.
To my valentine.
To finding each other.
Happy Valentine's Day.
Becky, I have a little something for you.
That's not it.
I hope you like them.
And I hope you like this.
Oh.
Oh, Jesse, sapphire earrings.
They're beautiful.
Whoa.
A genuine Elvis spoon.
- Thank you.
- I had no idea that you were gonna be extravagant.
If I'd known-- I love it, it's great, man.
It's gonna go perfect with my Elvis cheese grater.
- I've gotta try these on.
- All right.
Let's see how they look.
All right.
They're beautiful.
Thank you.
You know, Becky, I'm glad you made me wait four months before I got to go out with you.
It gave us a chance to know each other without all the pressures of dating.
I don't know.
I really feel like your friend.
You're different.
You're.
You're interesting.
You're honest.
You're open.
I mean, those qualities are hard to find.
Trust me, I've looked.
Listen to me, I'm rambling on here.
What I'm trying to say is I've always had trouble making commitments in the past.
- And I think maybe it's time that-- - Jesse, I know-- I know.
A lot of guys can say that to you but I'm gonna show you that I really mean it.
See this?
This is my little black book.
Actually, they were out of black the day I got it.
I'm won't need these phone numbers anymore because I wanna be with you every weekend.
So goodbye, ladies.
Well, actually, not every weekend.
I have a date this Saturday.
You have a date?
Well, we never talked about not seeing other people.
You have a date?
Okay.
Fine.
I can get a date for Saturday night too.
Yeah.
Let me see.
Oh, Becky, what am I doing?
I don't wanna play games.
- I just wanna be with you.
- I wanna be with you too.
But I feel like things are moving too fast for me.
Can't you just give me a little more time?
Yeah.
I'm not gonna blow this.
I'll wait for you.
Well, you don't have to wait alone.
Mmm, whoa, I thought we were gonna take this slow.
Okay.
Then let's do this slow.
Have mercy.
Okay.
We walk in, put the sweater back you stole, and walk out.
Now, just act casual.
What are you doing?
- Acting casual.
- Just act regular.
Hold it, young lady.
Do you have a receipt for this sweater?
No, ma'am, I don't have a receipt.
I'm a shoplifter.
You're gonna laugh when I explain this story to you.
Well, see, my cute little baby sister.
See how cute?
Well, see, she thought that "buy now, pay later" meant you could come back and pay later for it.
Little kids.
Do you girls realize that shoplifting is a serious crime?
- Yes.
- I'm going have to call your parents.
Could you ask to speak to Joey?
Follow me.
- You all right?
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, Dad.
- Hi.
Are you their father?
I am.
How dare you accuse these sweet, innocent girls of shoplifting.
- Dad, it was-- - Stephanie was Honeybee of the Month.
Don't you have anything better to do than harass my perfect little nieces?
Uncle Jesse, I stole the sweater.
Not everyone's perfect.
She stole the sweater for me because I ruined the one you gave me.
When I first came in here, did I throw a little hissy fit?
You know, that is so unlike him.
- Dad, I'm really sorry.
- I'm sorrier.
I'm just in shock because I raised my daughters to know the difference between right and wrong.
My hat.
Home, Joey.
We'll be paying cash for the hat.
You guys are very lucky that nobody is pressing charges.
You're not kidding.
They almost sent me up the stream.
That's up the river.
Hey, I'm new at this.
Girls, I really like that you tried to help each other but why didn't you come to me when you were in trouble?
Because I thought I could handle things on my own.
D.J., you always think that, but to be honest you're better at getting into trouble than getting out of it.
Well, is there any way to practice getting out without getting in?
Well, no.
But once you get in, you have to come to me or Uncle Jesse or Joey and let us help you.
Because no matter what happens, we're always on your side.
- Thanks, Dad.
- I love you.
Yeah, thanks, Daddy.
Maybe you can help us fix D.J.'s sweater.
I'll sure give it a try.
This was an $80 sweater.
But what's really important here is that we all learned a good lesson.
Eighty dollars.
Well, you little chicken wing, thanks for trying to help me.
Hey, you're my sister and you were in trouble.
Somebody had to do something.
I want you to know if you're ever in trouble, you can always count on me.
- Thanks.
Sisters forever?
- Sisters forever.
Does this mean I can play with your toys and borrow your CDs and clothes anytime I want?
Not a chance.
Hey, there was never gonna be a better time to ask.
Okay, one thing.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Now, you're never too young to learn who's cute and who's not.
Now, Michelle, this is George Michael.
Cute.
He was cute when he was with Wham!
He's graduated to rad.
Rad.
Now, this is Michael J. Fox.
The bad news is he's married.
The good news is he's our size.
Now, out of all these pictures, pick the cutest guy.
Big Bird.
Big Bird?
No one even knows if he's a guy.
Oh, good work, Michelle.
I am very proud of you.
Now.
Honey, now I'm gonna teach you the Tanner family motto: "Clean is good and dirt is bad".
Dirt bad.
The future is in good hands.
Stop!
I just finished cleaning the floors.
Something to think about.
If you hang a vine up here we can swing in like Tarzan.
- We're trapped.
- No, no, we're not.
Observe, Joseph.
Jess, don't get any dirt on the paper towels.
"Dirt on the paper towels.
Dirt on the paper towels".
Look at those nutty guys, Michelle.
If it wasn't for me, they would never have met.
Now, they're inseparable.
Isn't life ironic?
Yup.
Dad, we're home.
Stop!
Dirt bad.
No.
Dad taught Michelle the Tanner family motto.
Deej, I'm working on a new Tanner family motto: "Don't make fun of Dad until you can afford your own apartment".
Okay, here we go, Michelle.
Good girl.
Okay.
These are for you.
- Harry, let's do our math homework.
- Forget it.
I can't learn subtraction.
I'm gonna quit school and join the Boy Scouts.
I don't want my boyfriend to be a first-grade dropout.
How embarrassing.
Okay, look.
You have four oranges.
And then you take away two.
How many do you have left?
- Two.
- That's subtraction.
Very good, Harry.
Thanks, D.J. You're the smartest woman in the world.
Oh, yeah, four minus two.
Real genius.
D.J., can you tell me where babies come from?
Harry, stick to fruit.
Here we go.
Our first cup of coffee in our new office.
All right, Joseph, here's to Double J Creative Services.
Boy, next time, we gotta remember to plug that coffee machine in.
All right, Joseph, now that your room is our office we have to do a little redecoration in this joint.
Look at this place, you got hockey dummies you got puppets nailed to the wall you got Mr. Potato Head here.
Come on, it makes the room fun.
Fun?
Joey, this is not fun to me.
It's like working in Pee-wee's Playhouse.
That's right, boys and girls.
And today's secret word is "office".
Joey, I'm seri-- - I'm serious.
- I know you are, but what am I?
All right!
I give up with you.
- I like what you've done with your office.
- "Office"!
Joseph, you are a knucklehead.
Oh, come on, now.
Cut it out.
Hey, Joey, it's Jesse's turn to babysit tonight.
Why don't we eat in Chinatown and catch a movie?
Sounds great.
Why don't we pick up some pizza first and play some pool.
Hello.
Hi, man.
Hold on.
Jesse.
Well, it looks like we found ourselves a secretary.
Thank you, Michelle.
Hello.
Double J Creative Services, J speaking.
Joey, it's the boss.
Yes, sir.
What's up, Mr. Malatesta?
Oh, no.
- Oh, no.
- What's wrong?
We got a major crisis with the Chippy Chunk-Nut cookie account.
They found more chunk-nuts than chippys in the chocolates so all the chewy chippy chunk-nuts have to be called Nutty-Chewy Chunk Chips.
- How can they do that?
- How can they say that?
Yes, sir.
We'll take care of it.
Thank you, sir.
Well, partner, looks like we're gonna work tonight.
- Sorry, Danny.
- I'm sorry too.
I've been looking forward to this for at least 30 seconds.
- Hey, why don't we hang out tomorrow?
- Tomorrow's bad.
I'm supposed to go over next week's shows with Rebecca.
I got an idea.
I'll just ask her to move it to Sunday.
Why don't we go to the gym, shoot hoops like the old days.
Sounds great.
Same stakes?
Yep.
Loser does the other guy's homework.
- I'll get it.
- We have a secretary now, remember?
Hi, man.
Bye, man.
That's it, young lady.
You're fired.
Pack up and get out of our office.
"Office"!
- Mail call.
- Anything for me?
Oh, let's see.
Resident, that's for you.
Occupant, that's for you.
Detergent sample?
- That's for Dad.
- That's for Dad.
- Hi, ladies.
- Hi, Harry.
Oh, Harry.
An "I love you" lollipop.
You are so sweet.
Thank you.
It's for D.J. You're in love with D.J.?
Harry Takayama!
How can this be true?
Sorry, chief, but ever since yesterday, all I wanna do is subtract.
Wanna have lunch tomorrow?
Thanks for asking, Harry but lucky for me, I'm having lunch with Kimmy tomorrow.
No problem.
I'll bring a friend.
We'll double.
- See you, honey.
- Oh, Harold, honey?
Harold?
- Bye, chief.
- Don't call me chief.
You rat!
You skunk!
You skunky rat!
You stole my man.
Man?
I have Ken dolls bigger than him.
Danny, come on.
Gumby doesn't stretch as much as you do.
Proper warm-up prevents injury.
Okay, I'm ready.
Let's go.
Play ball.
All right.
Hey, look, the girls' locker room is open.
The only reason I still fall for that is because of the one time it was open.
- Okay, your ball out.
- Okay.
Look, a glacier passed by the window.
Isn't this great?
It's just like the old days.
I'm still taller than you.
Remember the last time we played?
July 29th, 1972.
It was raining.
You got mad because I fouled you with my umbrella.
- Joseph.
- Hey, Jess, what's up?
- Guys, we're in the middle of a game.
- Traveling.
My ball.
Great news.
We saved the cookie account.
That is great news.
Danny, my mom's watching the girls.
I'm going to Hippo's.
A bunch of us are gonna celebrate turning Chippy Chunk-nuts - into Nutty-Chewy Chunk Chips.
- I'm your partner.
I'm going with you.
- Bye, Danny.
- Jess.
I promised Danny that I'd play basketball-- No, no.
Don't let me ruin your fun.
Go, party with strangers.
Hold on.
Danny, we'll play sudden death.
We'll finish the game.
Next basket wins.
Thanks for squeezing me in, pal.
- Hurry up, Joey.
I'll wait for you.
- All right.
Here we go.
Foul.
On the big man.
I got wristing.
Wristing?
What the heck is wristing?
You hit me on the wrist.
Got a better name for it?
I hit all ball.
Jesse, you saw it.
Did I wrist him?
You did hit him on the wrist.
If there is such a thing as wristing I'd have to say you wristed him.
Okay, fine.
Take his side.
What else is new?
Thanks for the game.
Nice hanging out.
Real quality time.
Danny, we'll play later.
What's the big deal?
If I have to explain it to you, I don't know why we were friends in the first place.
Danny, you're acting like a little kid.
I am not.
Now, give me back my ball.
Hi, D.J. Michelle, what are you doing in here?
I don't know.
Here's the rest of your stuff, Michelle.
Thanks for switching rooms with me.
Stephanie, there's no way I'm sharing a room with a 2-year-old.
There's no way I'm sharing a room with a no-good, skunky, ratty rotten, lame-oid boyfriend-stealer.
Would you get off this?
Harry's a first-grade kid with a crush on an attractive older woman.
Watch out, Michelle.
She'll be your best buddy until you've got something she wants.
And then nothing is safe.
Michelle, don't believe her.
You know you can trust me.
My bunny.
Well, it had to happen.
The vacuum cleaner finally turned on him.
Danny, what's going on with you?
Why'd you walk off the court today?
Oh, no, you don't.
Don't give me the vacuum treatment.
Never pull my plug when I'm cleaning.
Never point your finger at me unless I have food on my face.
Never tell me what to do-- Fred, Ethel.
Are you guys gonna let a basketball game break up a 20-year friendship?
The only reason we became friends was because the day we met, I saved his butt.
You got that all backwards, jack.
I saved your butt.
Excuse me, but if my memory serves me, and it always does it happened exactly like this.
We were in the fifth grade.
We'd just finished lunch.
I remember, it was macaroni and cheese and Jell-O cubes.
Wait a second, I traded the Jell-O cubes for succotash.
I don't like Jell-O cubes.
The pieces of fruit get stuck in your teeth.
Just tell the story, huh?
Okay.
The year was 1968.
We were sitting out in front of school on a bench.
My nose was bleeding again.
Off to a bad start at your new school, Joseph Gladstone.
Clowns belong in the circus, not in the schoolyard.
Now, unless you wanna be suspended on your first day, sit right here and don't move a muscle.
How's that nosebleed, Daniel?
Clotting nicely.
Thank you, Miss Borland.
Who wants a kiss?
What's the matter?
Doofy Danny got a boo-boo?
You threw the ball at my head when I wasn't looking.
Well, you're looking now.
Made you flinch.
Hey, I like your hair.
- Thanks.
- Who cuts it, Roto-Rooter?
- Oh, yeah?
- Good comeback.
Is that your head, or did your neck blow a bubble?
Thank you, thank you.
Cut it out.
Where'd you get all those great jokes?
This book, A Thousand and One Insults.
Pretty groovy, huh?
Hey, one at a time.
There's the kid who was picking on me.
That's it.
I'm calling your parents.
- But-- - Wait, Miss Borland.
That boy's lying.
Joseph has been a perfect angel.
- Tanner's the liar.
- That's not possible.
Daniel Tanner's never been in trouble a day in his life.
Let's you and I visit the principal, Sheldon.
- Sheldon?
- Sheldon?
- Thanks, man.
You saved my life.
- You saved me first.
We saved each other.
That means we're soul brothers.
To make it official, we each have to bury something real important to us.
Bury something?
Won't we get dirty?
It's okay, I'll be careful.
Good.
Let's do the soul shake.
Until you learn to stop chasing the girls, Jesse Katsopolis you're gonna sit right here with me.
Have mercy.
I remember that teacher.
I used to have fantasies about Miss Borland dancing on Laugh-In with "Sock it to me" painted on her tummy.
Sorry.
That was a beautiful story.
You guys were there for each other.
Were there for each other.
I should have let Sheldon cream you.
Come on, guys, don't you realize how lucky you are?
I wish I had one good friend all these years.
You have history.
You guys buried something together.
You're soul brothers.
All in the past.
I'm gonna go dig up that box we buried because I don't want my stuff resting next to yours for all eternity.
I'm going with you because I want my stuff too and I don't remember where we buried it.
Well, that just says it all.
Miss Borland.
I wonder if I still have her number.
Sorry, Michelle, but you can't live here.
Now, go back to your room.
No, this is my room.
You live with D.J. now.
Michelle, don't listen to her.
Go back to your room.
What a day.
Hi, Steph.
Hi, honey.
Your boyfriend's here.
He is not my boyfriend.
All I did was teach him how to subtract.
You hypnotized him with oranges and you put him in a love trance.
Enough of this.
Everybody step into my room.
We're gonna play a game of Junior Love Connection.
Come on.
I'd rather play Divorce Court.
Michelle, what are you doing?
Don't read my mail.
That's personal.
What am I saying?
All right.
Come on, now.
You go to your own little room, okay?
What room?
First she reads my mail, then she gives me lip.
Come on, get out of here.
All right.
D.J., Harry, come here.
Now, D.J., as nicely as you can tell Harry how you really feel about him.
Kid, you don't have a prayer.
Nicer, huh?
Look, Harry, don't blow a good thing.
You already have a great girl right here, Stephanie Tanner.
Sorry, chief.
Forgive me?
In your dreams.
What Harry is trying to say is: "I've made a big mistake.
The biggest mistake of my life.
Come on, chief.
Don't forget the good old days.
Kindergarten.
Please, I'm begging you.
Take me back.
Take me back".
"Oh, Harry, I forgive you".
"I'm so happy.
Shake".
There you go.
Okay, you're my boyfriend again.
Great.
- What was that for?
- You're it!
Love is weird.
Trust me, babe.
It gets a lot weirder.
Danny, come on, you dig slower than you play basketball.
There goes that glacier again.
You think you can do better?
- Here.
You dig.
- Okay.
I hit something.
I don't believe this.
This is it.
Oh, man.
It's my old Giants cap.
My very first insult book.
What's this?
That's the pledge.
I forgot all about this.
"This is to prove that on February 23rd, 1968 we pledge on our most sacred possessions to be soul brothers for life even if one guy moves real far away.
Right on.
Get down.
Stay funky".
Signed, Daniel Ernest Tanner and Joseph Alvin Gladstone.
We have horrible middle names.
The worst.
But we kept this pledge, didn't we?
It's amazing.
When we were growing up, man, we did everything together.
We're still doing everything together.
Yeah, but, Joey, it's not the same.
I feel really stupid saying this but ever since you and Jesse became good buddies, and now you're partners I don't know, I feel left out.
Is that what this is all about?
Why didn't you just tell me this in the first place?
I didn't want you to get the wrong idea.
I'm glad you and Jesse are friends.
I just miss the way our friendship used to be.
Danny, I live in your house.
I'm helping you raise your girls.
I've always been your best friend, I'll always be your best friend.
Says so right here in the pledge.
I've been acting like a jerk.
No.
Yes, you have.
But you had a good reason.
Danny, I'm sorry I've been taking our friendship for granted.
But just remember this: No matter what happens, we're always there for each other.
What do you say we bury this stuff again and come back when we're old and dig it up.
Yeah.
By then I'll be so shriveled up, this cap might fit me.
Okay.
Here's my cap.
My book.
The pledge.
Wait a minute.
Something's missing here.
You guys are nuts.
I had to stash the girls at the Gibblers' rush down here just to bring you my blow dryer?
Sorry, we needed your most prized possession.
Sign here.
"This is to prove that Danny T., Joey G. and Jesse K. are official soul brothers pals and best friends forever".
You don't have to do this.
This is your thing.
- Now, it's our thing.
- We're all in this together.
Thank you, guys.
I'm touched.
But my blow dryer?
All right.
But if my hair looks like hell tomorrow, I'm digging that thing up.
Now, we gotta do the official soul-brother handshake.
- Guys, isn't this a little silly?
- We could all hug.
Let's do the shake.
Okay.
Watch.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Look, Michelle, look who Kimmy brought to see you.
Do you wanna pet the baby Sharpei?
Uh-huh.
Come and see our new puppies.
Say hi fast before my mom sells them for a bundle.
Hi, doggy.
Let's teach them some tricks.
Okay.
Roll over.
D. Roll over.
Michelle, you make a great pet.
I wonder if she can catch a Frisbee in her mouth.
Come on, Michelle.
Pet the puppies.
Okay, Michelle.
I'm watering my big plant, Scooby-Doo.
You water your little plant, Scrappy-Doo.
: I'm thirsty, Michelle.
Water me.
Water me.
Good morning, kids.
Come on, we gotta watch Danny's show.
- What's up?
- Well Becky will wink if I have a date with her tonight.
One wink for yes.
Two winks for no.
If she gets something caught in her eye, you could end up engaged.
CHORUS  Wake up!
All right, here we go.
Wake up, San Francisco.
I'm Danny Tanner.
And I'm Rebecca Donaldson.
Is that a wink or a blink?
I don't know.
I was staring at her legs.
Anyway, before we bring our first guest out, I have a surprise.
I thought it'd be fun to see our city fresh through the eyes of a typical tourist from the Midwest, Mr. Anderson.
Hi there, Mr. Anderson.
Ooh.
- What brings you to San Francisco?
- Mommy.
Howie, say hi to the Bay Area.
Hi, Bay.
Hi, Howie.
Howie came all the way from Nebraska to visit with his Aunt Becky.
Oh, hold it.
You said, "tourist".
This is your nephew.
Yes, my nephew the tourist.
Howie, before you give us your impressions on the city wave to Grandma Rose and Grandpa Wilbur.
Howie cute.
Rebecca, this is a shameless display of using our show just to talk to your family.
I'm sorry you had to see that, Mom, Dad, Cousin Ed.
Sorry, Danny.
I just thought it would be a nice gesture.
Hot dog, Joseph.
A double wink.
Chill that champagne, pal.
Howie, you're out of here.
Blow a kiss to San Francisco.
Oh, that was sweet.
Come back anytime, Mr. Anderson.
We'll be back with some real guests, so don't go away.
Ah, Michelle.
Joseph, it looks like our girl Michelle's got her very first crush.
You mean it, Michelle?
You really like Howie?
Nice boy.
Wait right there.
Wait right there.
Michelle, do you know who's right outside that door, young lady?
I don't know.
Well, then, Joey tell Michelle about the bachelor she chose for her dream date.
Well, he's 2'9" and has blond hair and baby-blue eyes.
He hails from Valentine, Nebraska where his hobbies are playing with his food and hiding his shoes in the toilet.
Michelle, say hello to Howie Anderson.
Howie.
- Howie, say hi to Michelle.
- Hi, Michelle.
Hi, Howie.
I know what you're thinking, Michelle.
He's a lot taller in person.
Monkey.
Thank you.
I'd like you to meet Michelle's very first boyfriend Rebecca's nephew, Howie.
- Hey, kid.
- Hi, Howie.
Hi, girls.
He's cute, Michelle.
Now you have a boyfriend and I have a boyfriend and.
Well, two out of three is not bad.
Dad, was she really necessary?
Jess, can you watch the kids?
I wanna catch Joey's set at the Laugh Machine.
Because I love his act, and I get in free.
- Becky and I supposed to go out tonight.
- No, that's okay.
I can bring Howie back here.
I can give my sister a break on her last night in town.
The kids can play, and later you and I can play.
Have mercy.
You hear that, Michelle?
It's our first double-date.
Camel.
Elephant.
I see where Michelle picked up that little trick.
Hey, I got it from the kid.
Ask her.
This thing's broken.
There, it's fixed.
Good, because it's yours.
I got it.
The all-time monster classic.
- The Wolf Man.
- All right!
All right!
All wrong.
You're not gonna watch this movie with us.
Yes, I am.
It's my house too.
This is too scary for you and this conversation is over.
We'll see about that.
Uncle Jesse.
Uncle Jesse.
She is such a tattletale.
I am not.
And I'm telling you said that.
What's all the ruckus in here?
They say I can't watch The Wolf Man.
Whoa, The Wolf Man.
This is a great flick.
This guy's got scarier hair than Don King.
I gotta see this movie.
You're too young.
Remember when you watched The Blob?
You wouldn't go near Jell-O for a month.
So?
I watched The Wizard of Oz and I wasn't afraid of the Wicked Witch of the West.
See, I'm cool.
Maybe she should wait until she's a little older.
Come on.
They can handle it.
The key to watching The Wolf Man is that he's a regular guy that gets a little cranky when the moon comes out.
I slay myself.
You'll be sorry.
The Wolf Man is gonna scare you bigtime.
If you don't scare me, nothing will.
Sorry.
Jess, I don't think that Stephanie's old enough to watch The Wolf Man.
Oh, come on, it's a fun little monster movie.
What's fun about a guy with a lot of hair who bites people?
Come here, I'll show you.
Jess, are you telling me you'd let your kids watch anything they wanted?
I'd make sure little Dustin knows the difference - between real and make-believe but-- - Yes, but what if?
Dustin?
You would name a kid Dustin?
- Yeah, you got a better name?
- I sure do.
Emily.
No son of ours is gonna be called Emily.
Our daughter's name is Emily.
Our son's name is Prescott.
Prescott?
May as well name him Emily.
Our son is gonna be called Dustin.
- Prescott.
- Dustin.
- Prescott.
- Dust-- When did we have a kid?
I don't know.
I'm sorry I missed it.
Oh, God, I'm embarrassed.
- Oh, boy.
I'll make you a deal.
- Hmm.
We won't name our kids until we've been dating at least three months.
- Okay, that's a fair deal.
- Deal.
Deal.
Hey, I'm into it.
D. Hey, look out, lady!
The Wolf Man's behind that tree.
Why is that woman in the woods at night anyway?
She should be in a restaurant.
Shh.
- Drinks?
: Aah!
I told you they'd be scared.
They were scared of you, not the movie.
Shh.
Something's gonna happen.
I can tell because the music's getting scarier.
You girls all know that this is just make-believe, right?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
You women okay?
Good.
All right.
Enjoy the movie.
It's a good flick.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
: Aww.
: Aww.
: Aww.
- Connie, look at your son.
- What a cute couple.
They haven't left each other's side all day.
We better go.
You don't wanna miss your plane.
You're right.
It might accidentally take off on time.
Come on, Howie.
Wake up.
It's time to go.
Gotta go home.
Howie no go.
Howie yes go.
Howie go back home.
- Me go.
- No, little kemosabe.
No can go to Nebraska.
Take many moons.
Okay.
Now say goodbye to Howie.
- Bye, Howie.
Well, she's hugging already.
She's definitely a Tanner.
Let's go, come on.
Come on.
- All right, let's go.
- All right, bye, everybody.
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.
I'm sorry, Michelle.
But you have to go back to sleep now.
- There you go.
Good night.
- Night-night.
Howie no bye-bye.
Howie no bye-bye.
Howie no bye-bye.
Howie.
Come on, honey.
You've gotta go to sleep.
It's 2 a.m. It's like she lost her best friend.
All she kept saying was, "Howie.
Howie".
Shh.
Don't say the H word.
Look, she's finally asleep.
- Good night, Michelle.
- Good night, Michelle.
D.J. D.J., did that horn wake you up?
No, you woke me up, you little nerd bomber.
I know the Wolf Man's not real but if he was, would he be driving an Isuzu?
Stephanie, the Wolf Man is just an actor who needs a flea collar.
Scary movies are just for fun.
In that case, I'm having the funnest night of my life.
Ha, ha, ha.
That was the Gibblers' dog.
Look, I'll go make you some warm milk.
That'll help you sleep.
Thanks, D.J. Hurry up.
Mr. Bear, did George Michael have that much hair on his face yesterday?
I didn't think so.
Hey, hey, hey.
What's going on here?
Why are you choking Mr. Bear?
I thought he was the Wolf Man.
You said there was no Wolf Man.
Joey, go get him.
He's driving an Isuzu.
What's going on?
The Wolf Man movie scared Stephanie.
Who gave you permission to watch a monster movie?
What?
I just woke up.
How could I be in trouble?
You let Stephanie watch The Wolf Man, now she can't sleep.
Well, D.J. and Kimmy were watching, and I didn't.
- You said you weren't gonna be scared.
- And you believed me?
Honey I know you wanna do everything your big sister does but sometimes some things have to wait until you're older.
Every time I close my eyes I see that scary Wolf Man.
I admit he's no Rob Lowe.
If you saw him at home with his parents you'd probably think he's pretty funny.
The Wolf Man has parents?
- Get out of here.
- Well, sure he does.
Let me show you.
Let's see.
We need a Wolf Man.
Someone with wild, uncontrollable hair.
Oh, gee.
Who let her watch the movie?
Okay, I'll be Wolfie.
Good, I'll be the father, Mr. Wolf.
And I'll be the mother, Virginia Wolf.
Wolfie, what's the matter with you?
Look at that posture.
Straighten up.
You'll get a hunchback.
You'll never get into Notre Dame.
Kids nowadays.
Were you out scaring people again, young man?
King Kong does it.
Oh, and I suppose if King Kong jumped off the Empire State Building you'd do it too.
Now there's going to be no more howling at the moon no more chasing cars, and you tell little Stephanie you're sorry for scaring her.
I'm sorry, Steph.
I didn't think the movie would frighten you.
It's okay, Wolfie.
I'm not scared anymore.
Right.
Now, you see, Steph, see?
Next time you're scared you just take all that scary stuff and turn it into something funny.
That'll come in handy next time I watch a monster movie.
Which will be never.
Come on, Steph.
Let's go to bed.
- I'll go tuck them in.
- I'll take care of them.
You, young man, go right back to bed, and remember brush your fangs and comb your face.
Good morning, Michelle.
Where Howie?
Oh, pal, your friend Howie went back home to Nebraska which is a good four-week toddle from here.
Come on.
- You want some breakfast?
- I want Howie.
Michelle.
Michelle, you.
Anybody out there?
Help.
All right, Michelle.
Now if I give you a ride, will that make you happy?
No.
How's she doing?
Howie.
Any other questions?
We gotta cheer this kid up.
Michelle, we'll play with your rings.
These are great.
- Let's play zoo.
- Want me to read you Dr. Seuss?
Let's sing.
Stop.
Where Howie?
You know what?
I got just the thing that'll work.
Michelle, let's go.
Come with me, Michelle.
I probably didn't need to say that, now did I?
Howie.
We may have to move to Nebraska.
This is gonna get old fast.
- You ready?
- Yeah.
There you go.
Now, come on, Michelle.
You know what I love more than anything in this whole wide world?
That's to see you smile.
Come on, give me one of those famous Michelle smiles, please.
Howie.
Oh, kid.
I know you miss your friend Howie.
But don't forget about your family who loves you like crazy right here.
Remember all the good times we had together?
I'm gonna sing that song I wrote for you, okay?
- Okay.
- Okay, let me sing it for you, all right?
All right.
Michelle's at home The cats are purring She doesn't know what worry is She's safe and warm And she's not sorry She doesn't know what sorry is Michelle smiling Michelle smiling Michelle smiling The news is on And Michelle's laughing Can't make sense of what The pictures show She knows no fear She keeps on laughing If we could only know What Michelle knows Michelle smiling Michelle smiling Michelle smiling Oh, there you go.
That's a girl.
Where Howie?
Jess, where are you?
I'm coming.
I'm coming.
- How's Michelle doing?
- The poor kid's got a broken heart.
I have a tape here that might help.
Let's watch the tape.
Watch this, Michelle.
Howie!
Hi, Michelle.
Hi, Howie.
How are you?
I'm fine.
- I miss you.
- Me too.
Now, that's the smile I was singing about, kid.
Rebecca, you might be onto something here.
- Fisher-Price video dating.
- We made it last night at the airport.
I just thought these two would make great video pals.
This is weird.
I mean, I know Michelle's only 2, but she's acting like a real person.
I guess you're never too young to need a friend.
Our little Michelle is growing up.
Maybe it's time to put her in a playgroup with kids her age.
That's a great idea.
At least she'd have some friends in the same zip code.
I'm so impressed with you.
You're right about everything.
You were right about the monster movie you had this idea to make a tape for Michelle.
You're gonna make a great mom.
Thanks.
You already are one.
Howie, again.
Michelle, you just saw Howie.
Howie.
Howie.
Howie.
Hey, why don't we watch a little HTV?
All Howie, all the time.
: Howie.
Howie.
Howie.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
That's mine.
You already had two.
One of mine was broken.
It didn't count.
Listen, Stephanie Judith.
I'm listening, Donna Jo Margaret.
Stop it.
Be nice.
Okay, you can have the cookie.
No, it's your cookie.
My cookie.
You know who she reminds me of?
You.
- Here you go, Jesse.
- Thank you.
Two gallons of milk.
All right, a can of tomato juice.
Think fast.
And of course, the box boy's own personal touch bread on the bottom of the bag.
Break out the root beer, boys.
My report card is awesome.
: All right.
Three A's, a B and a B minus.
I wish I got grades like that.
I stayed after school so often people thought I was the janitor.
Steph, these are terrific grades.
But your teacher wrote here: "Stephanie is a wonderful student but she needs to control her talking in class".
Dad, it's not my fault.
Kids are always asking me for help.
And who can blame them?
Check out these grades.
If you're always talking during class, you might miss something important.
Yeah, like recess.
Or reading and writing and fundamental things.
Steph, you have to stop being such a little chatterbox.
So.
My own family thinks I'm a chatterbox?
- How rude.
- Steph-- No, no, it's fine.
From now on, this little chatterbox is all locked up.
Dad, you've gotta do something.
Listen to my report card.
It's so unfair.
- A, A, A, A-- - How dare they?
This is an outrage.
You didn't hear my Spanish grade, D. A D in Spanish?
Huh?
SeÃ±orita Mosley hates me.
I don't know why, but she just does.
She loves me.
I got a C. Hold it.
You got a C in Spanish and D.J. got a D?
Hey man, I saw La Bamba five times.
Six A's and one D. Something's wrong here.
I think I'll have a talk with your teacher.
Thanks, Dad.
I knew I could count on you.
D.J., one day you're gonna be very happy you can speak a second language.
It always comes in handy.
Oh, excuse me, Mr. Berlitz.
- What other languages do you speak?
- Well, it just so happens I speak several.
I'm fluent in frog.
Let's see, I studied moose at Whatsamatta U. And I speaks just a smattering of sailor.
: Whoa!
- Who is it?
Stephanie?
It's Mr. Malatesta.
Jesse and Joey's boss.
Thanks.
Uh, are the fellas in?
Where's their office?
Down through the kitchen and down the stairs.
Thanks.
Just what we need in San Francisco.
Another mime.
- Peekeeboo.
- Peekeeboo.
- Peekeeboo.
- Peekeeboo.
- Peekeeboo.
- Peekeeboo.
I see you.
I see you too.
Joseph, company.
Mr. Malatesta.
Now I know why you fellas work at home.
It's so hard to get up a good game of peekeeboo at the agency.
I'll go make some coffee.
I'll make my bed.
Fellas, we got big trouble on the Mr. Marshmallow account.
We need a new slogan and we need it now.
Peekeeboo.
Not now, Michelle.
We're trying to work.
All right, you just sit here and enjoy these delicious marshmallows.
- Delicious.
How about that?
- It's been done.
Yummy.
"Yummy".
Now there's a great word.
But it needs more.
Michelle, what else you got?
No, no, no.
It needs "yummy in the tummy".
Yummy in the tummy.
- It works for her.
- It works for me too.
And I love it coming from a cute little baby.
Okay, picture this, sir.
Picture this.
You got the baby, right?
She's floating on a cloud that looks like a marshmallow.
- You got the music, the wind blowing-- - Great.
Now we gotta find the most adorable baby in San Francisco.
Fellas, she is cute, but don't you think we should use a professional baby?
Sir, this kid has got two years of experience playing a baby.
Give him a kiss.
Give him a kiss.
Okay, kid, you've got the job.
But you better be good.
Don't worry, be happy.
And this is my Spanish class.
Now remember, Dad, that D was totally unfair.
Don't worry, I'm on your side.
I'll get your grade straightened out.
Hi, Steph.
How's it going?
You think she's carrying this "I'm not a chatterbox" thing too far?
Personally, I find it a refreshing change of pace.
Hey, Mr. Tanner, did you get D.J.'s grade changed yet?
Did you yell at SeÃ±orita Mosley?
Did you make her cry?
He hasn't gone in yet.
Chicken?
Kimmy, you're doing so well in Spanish.
You ever think of moving to Mexico?
Come on, Dad.
Class is gonna start.
Now go in there and show no mercy.
Okay, don't worry, Deej.
I'm totally cool.
Excuse me, SeÃ±orita Mosley?
Danny Tanner?
I mean, Mr. Tanner.
Oh, I love your talk show.
I watch you all the time.
You know, you're taller than I thought you'd be.
Yeah, well, on TV I'm only this big.
Oh, you are so funny.
I loved the show last week where you learned how to make pizza dough.
Really?
You know, it's harder than it looks.
First you gotta pound the dough.
Dad's really giving it to her now.
Or you can just pick up a phone and order one.
Oh, you're so witty.
No wonder you're such a big star.
Oh, well, I wouldn't call myself a big star.
But you just did.
It would be pretty silly for me to argue, huh?
- Well, it's nice meeting you.
- Nice meeting you.
Oh, wait.
I came here to talk about D.J.'s grade.
Why did she get a D?
Well, she started out getting B's and C's.
But then as the work got harder, she got discouraged and she stopped trying.
Well, I was wondering, do you think--?
Oh, look, I'm sorry, class is starting.
You know, I'd be happy to stop by after school and set up a study program to help D.J. catch up.
Really?
I'd appreciate that.
- Thank you.
- Well, I'm here to help.
Well, until later.
Uh, El Pollo Loco.
- Bye.
- Bye.
So, what's my new grade?
A?
A plus?
A minus?
D. D?
That's the grade I had.
I thought you were on my side.
I am, D.J. SeÃ±orita Mosley thinks she can help you bring up that D. We'll talk about this after school.
Yummy in the tummy.
That was good, Michelle.
Next time, try it with more energy.
Nice and loud.
Yummy in the tummy!
What are you doing?
You're turning my sweet little Michelle into Sam Kinison.
Come on, Michelle, grab your wardrobe.
You're gonna make that Gerber baby wanna hang up her booties.
Come on, come on.
And we'll label the door, "la puerta".
- La puerta.
- See you later, Danny.
Nice meeting you, Linda.
Right back at you.
Oh, wait a minute.
Oh, good luck, Michelle.
When you're a big star, remember who changed your diapers all those years.
: Me.
Come on, let's keep labeling.
This is a fun way for D.J. to help build her Spanish vocabulary.
This is el sofa.
The sofa is el sofa?
How could she get a D in this language?
Well, they're not all that easy.
Oh.
Perro.
That means two of, right?
As in you have a lovely perro eyes.
That's very sweet of you, but no.
It means dog, and it's pronounced: "Perro".
The double R is very important in the Spanish language.
It rolls.
Come on, try it with me.
Perro.
Perro.
Perro.
You need more lips.
Now, watch my mouth.
Perro.
I'm sorry.
Oh, no, no.
Linda, wait a minute.
Don't be sorry.
That felt nice.
Whoa, baby.
So that's why you took her side.
Thanks for sticking up for me, Dad.
D.J., something tells me we need to talk.
There's nothing to talk about.
You kissed my teacher.
You kissed Mr. Zambruskie?
No, I kissed SeÃ±orita Mosley.
You kissed a teacher?
Ew!
Oops.
There I go again.
Chattering away.
Silly me.
I can't believe you sold out your own daughter for a kiss.
That's not what happened.
You said you were on my side.
Let's get a few things straight here.
My kissing SeÃ±orita Mosley had nothing to do with you.
Kissing her was a mistake, and it will never happen again.
But that has nothing to do with your D in Spanish.
Dad, forget my grade.
You kissed my teacher.
And all my friends saw it.
Look, parents make mistakes too.
I don't know what else to say.
You're just gonna have to accept my apology.
Fine.
Apology accepted.
Excuse me.
That went well.
All right, the lighting is a little harsh.
Can you turn it down, please?
You're starting to toast my marshmallows.
Thank you, you're a nice kid.
Don't change.
All right, let me see.
Yeah.
- Look at our son.
- He's such a big shot now.
It seems like just yesterday I diapered this little tushy.
Whoa, Mother, please, with my tushy?
I have to work with these people, huh?
- What are you guys doing here?
- Oh, you asked us to pick up Michelle.
Yes, at 6:00.
- It's only 4, Mother.
- Oh, are we early?
Irene, you have a camera around your neck.
- You're not fooling anybody.
- Okay, okay.
We came to see Michelle.
Where's our little superstar?
Step aside, please.
Make way for Miss Tanner.
Hey, babe.
Hey, babe.
I told you you'd get a laugh with that.
No, please, no autographs.
Miss Tanner can't write.
Look at this little cutie-pie.
She's like.
Irene, who's that redhead I like on Gilligan's Island?
Not Mary Ann, the movie star.
- Tina Louise.
- That's right.
She's a teeny, tiny Tina.
- Hey, look at that little tushy.
- No, Mother, whoa!
Mother, do you have to grab everyone's tushy?
Come on, Irene.
All right.
Here we go, little angel.
Okay, now.
What you do, you sit up here on the marshmallow-- - Ma?
- Okay.
Okay.
- Stand by, everyone.
Stand by, everyone.
- We're almost ready.
- Okay, ready.
- To make marshmallow magic.
- That's it, marshmallow magic.
Okay, Michelle, let's show Mr. Malatesta just how we practiced it.
No more.
- This is just how she warms up.
- That's right.
She throws one first.
Meryl Streep, same technique.
Okay, Michelle, remember: "Yummy in the tummy".
Yucky.
It sounded like she said "yucky".
Tummy full.
What's happened, sir, is she's rehearsed all day.
She went through a whole bag of these.
I understand.
It happens.
Dump the baby.
See if you can get me the baby from the dogfood commercial.
Sir, let her digest.
Is this guy crazy?
This is the next Tina Louise.
Nicky, let me talk to him.
I can be nice.
Mother, that's my boss.
Don't touch his tushy.
Oh, Michelle, you were terrific.
We just let you eat too many marshmallows.
Now, don't take this personally.
You're fired.
- You're fired.
- No, you're fired.
- No, you.
- No, you.
- No.
- No.
Give me a kiss.
You're still fired.
You're fired.
Come on, Steph, we made your all-time favorite lunch.
Peanut butter, jelly and banana.
We've gotta get that kid to talk.
I have no idea what's going on in the first grade.
Come on, D.J., you're gonna be late for school.
Oh, I don't wanna go to school.
I feel sick.
D.J., you're not sick.
You're worried the kids will tease you about your dad kissing the teacher, right?
Oh, yeah.
Well, I'll tell you the perfect way to handle this.
What you do is you go in and tell jokes about your dad kissing the teacher.
That way it's no fun to tease you.
You beat them to the punchline.
- But I don't know any jokes.
- I'll help you write them.
You know, when I was in sixth grade, I had a face full of zits.
- Nobody teased me.
- Why not?
I beat up the first guy who said something.
Actually, it might be best to go with Joey's plan in this case.
Linda, it's not that I'm not attracted to you.
I just think it's inappropriate for us to date while you're D.J.'s teacher.
You're right.
Why did I kiss you?
How could I do such a horrible thing?
I just said it was inappropriate.
I didn't think it was repulsive.
I meant, I shouldn't be involved with a student's parent.
And I don't want to put D.J. in an awkward position.
But you know I'll only be her teacher for three more months.
We'll have dinner the day she graduates.
You're on.
I'd better slip out the back door.
Oh, Danny, Danny, that's the closet.
Ah, let's not get settled yet.
We're gonna take a field trip to the cafeteria to learn the Spanish words for knife, fork and mystery meat.
: Ooh.
That's okay, SeÃ±orita Mosley.
Ooh?
That's the best you can do?
You guys need some help.
How about this: Knock, knock.
- Who's there?
- Deej.
- Deej who?
- Deej you see my father kiss the teacher?
- D.J.-- - Oh, no, you'll love this one.
Why does my father wear "I love SeÃ±orita Mosley" suspenders?
To keep my grades up.
Oh, hi, Deej.
: Ooh.
What did I ever do to you?
- Class, this isn't what you think.
- That's right.
Well, guys, I'm sure you've all seen my TV show every day.
We're doing a special on great closets in San Francisco.
When will that closet special be on, Mr. Tanner?
I'll let you know, Kimmy.
Thanks for asking.
Amazing.
That guy looks just like my dad.
Dad, why did you hide in the closet?
That's the first place everyone looks.
I wasn't hiding, I was trying to leave.
D.J., do you remember that speech I gave you - about parents making mistakes?
- Mm-hm.
You wanna hear it again?
Look, I just want you to know that I'm not gonna see Linda while she's your teacher.
And I'm really sorry, again, that I embarrassed you, again.
But I think we should talk about what started this whole mess.
That you wouldn't get my grade changed?
You know you deserved that D. All right.
Maybe I just sort of gave up.
But let's face it, I'm no good in Spanish.
Hold it, Deej.
Come here.
Look.
Honey, I understand it's frustrating.
So many things come so easily to you.
But not everything will.
And if you give up on something just because it's difficult you're gonna miss out on a lot that's valuable.
There's no better feeling than conquering something that's really hard for you.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
But what if I work as hard as I can and I still can't get an A?
Then I'll be proud of you for working as hard as you can.
Okay, I'll try.
- Thanks.
- That's "gracias".
You're a padre muy bueno.
Huh?
That means you're a great dad.
Come on, Steph.
I can't take the silence.
Please.
I miss the old chatterbox.
- Let's hear a little chatter.
- Are you sure?
Yeah, are you guys sure?
We wanna hear everything that happened today.
I think I'll go do my Spanish homework.
Okay, boys, have a seat.
Okay.
This morning Mr. Gibbler ran his car over a garbage can then got TV dinner trays all over the street.
- You don't say.
- I do say.
Then I saw a dog that looked just like a lion.
I thought it really was a lion.
Then Mrs. Norton hit it on the head with a newspaper.
And then it barked, so I was pretty sure it was a dog.
- Really?
- Would I make that up?
Did you hear what happened to Virginia Gauding?
She got $5 from the tooth fairy.
Must have been a big tooth.
Are my teeth too small, or do I have a cheap tooth fairy?
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Baby, baby, baby.
Baby, baby, baby.
You sing.
It sounds great.
I mean, it's your song, you made it up.
You keep singing it.
Please.
All right, if you really want me to sing your song.
Baby, baby, baby.
Stop.
My turn.
Baby, baby, baby.
Baby, baby, baby.
Hey, you wrote it you know how to sing it.
Baby, baby, baby.
Good morning, troops.
It is now 0700 and it's time to attack the enemy.
Grease, grime, slime, sludge.
And that's just Joey's room.
Now, what is dirt?
Dirt bad.
I can't hear you.
Dirt bad!
Daddy's really into spring-cleaning, isn't he?
Steph, it may be spring-cleaning to us, but to Dad, it's Christmas.
Permission to whine.
Permission denied.
Get back in line, soldier.
Yes, your spotlessness.
- Look alive!
- Oh!
Don't do that.
I was having a beautiful dream.
We hired a cleaning service.
Now, troops, you all have your assignments.
Now sound off.
If we find dirt we will attack If we find dirt we will attack And we'll get Danny off our back And we'll get Danny off our back - Sound off - One, two - Sound off - Dirt bad Aah.
I love the smell of Lysol in the morning.
Mr. Bear, part of spring-cleaning is giving the toys we don't play with anymore to charity.
Should we keep Candy Land?
No, there's no real candy in it.
You are such a nutty bear.
Toys!
Michelle, before we give these toys away, is there something you want?
I want that.
Freeze, bearnapper!
Who, me?
Mr. Bear is not a toy.
He's one of the family.
If Mr. Bear's related to anyone in this room, it's the mattress.
Mr. Bear says, "How rude".
- Girls, what stuff's going to charity?
- Everything over there.
Okay.
Are you sure you wanna give this little baby doll?
It's Baby Giggle-tummy.
You push right there and she giggles.
Joey, let's go.
The truck's waiting downstairs.
Right away, your tidy bowlness.
Steph, come here.
You're the one small enough to clean behind the refrigerator.
- Michelle, you want this job?
- No, thank you.
Well, Michelle, my kitchen is immaculate.
How are you doing with your kitchen?
Dirt gone.
Yes, dirt gone.
But never forget, dirt come back.
Some dirt came back right there.
Daddy will get it.
Yo, Danny!
Oh!
You waxed the counter?
And you just buffed it.
Thanks, Jess.
I'm all finished cleaning.
I even hosed down the hose.
Everything's perfect.
Did I say perfect?
You broke off the handle.
You just ruined my kitchen.
I'll take care of it.
I'll get a new one.
Next time you see this kitchen, it'll be perfect.
- Michelle, wanna go for a ride in the car?
- Car dirty.
I hope you're proud of yourself.
Come on, you.
Come here.
Daddy, Daddy, have you seen Mr. Bear?
I can't find him anywhere.
Steph, I'm sure he's around here somewhere.
Maybe Joey's seen him.
If you see Mr. Bear before I do, tell him he's in very big trouble.
I'll give him the message.
Come on, Dad, let's go.
We're gonna be late for my karate match.
D.J., just a minute.
Joey, is the living room ready for inspection?
Yes, your neurotic compulsiveness.
Well, this might look beautiful to the naked eye but let's see if it passes the Tanner test for tidiness.
Yes, Danny, I cleaned all the logs in the fireplace.
I know how crazy you get about burning dirty wood.
Life doesn't get any better than this.
Yeah.
Dad, let's go.
Christmas is over.
Boy, I hate to leave.
Don't worry, Danny.
I'll stand guard here in case any dust tries to settle.
Oh, that felt so good.
Where's Mr. Bear?
Monkeys, rhinos, bunnies.
Not a bear in the bunch.
Call the FBI.
Call the police.
Call me a cab, I've got a bear to find.
Steph, come on.
Don't panic, just settle down.
Take a nice deep breath.
Good.
Now, when was the last time that--?
Steph, you can let the breath out now.
Good, good.
Now, when was the last time you saw Mr. Bear?
He was sitting on my bed helping me sort out toys.
Right.
He was here when I came up to collect the clothes and toys to give away to charity.
You didn't give away Mr. Bear, did you?
Steph, why don't you keep looking, and I'll see if I can track him down.
- Okay.
- Good.
God, I hate to bother you.
I know you've got a lot of stuff to do but Mr. Bear's missing.
So if you could squeeze in just one little miracle I'd be a happy camper.
D.J., you were great.
That kid was twice your size.
Thanks, Dad.
But next time I win a match, don't try and start a wave.
Ooh, I'm glad I'm not a part of this.
You're back already?
Do me a favor, keep your pop out of this kitchen for say, three or four days, huh?
Work fast.
Maybe I can give you three or four minutes.
- D.J., I'm gonna go start dinner.
- Dad, let's go have some Chinese food.
Okay.
Why don't we go to Chinatown?
We always go to Chinatown.
Let's go to China.
- I'll get the menu.
We'll call for takeout.
- Dad, don't go in there.
Huh.
Why did you let me go in there?
Could have gone to China.
Hi, pally, how are you?
You'd probably like an explanation, wouldn't you?
What happened is I went to the hardware store to buy a new handle.
But the design's discontinued.
So I got whole new set.
I got this whole new set.
Pretty decorative, huh?
Well, see, and then what happened was the screws were too fat.
I got a bunch of fat screws to make the holes bigger.
So I'm drilling, thus, breaking the veneer on the fronts.
So I had to put whole new fronts on the drawers.
Those.
You're wondering about those.
As well you should.
Well, see this part, this makes perfect sense because the cabinets and the drawers have to match.
Cabinet, drawers.
So, what I did was I got new fittings, but they didn't fit.
The fronts didn't fit, so I shaved them.
So when you walked in, I'm shaving.
I'm whistling, you walk-- I swear I'll clean it all up.
Everything was all cleaned up.
How could you do this to me?
On my day.
This is my Christmas.
You don't like the new handles?
Please.
I've looked everywhere.
I'm telling you, he was kidnapped.
Slow down.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Now, who was kidnapped?
My best friend in the whole world, Mr. Bear.
Let me get some information.
Now, does Mr. Bear have a first name?
Teddy.
He's exactly this tall: Brown hat, gray trench coat, brown snout.
This Mr. Bear, he's a stuffed animal, isn't he?
Well, technically.
You called the police because I messed up your kitchen?
Officer, what happened was the design was discontinued.
I put a new thing.
I'm doing new holes, it breaks, I'm shaving and he walks in.
Jesse, I didn't call the police.
Officer, what's the problem?
This little girl flagged me down to report a missing bear.
Brown hat, gray trench coat, brown snout.
Steph, I think I know what might have happened.
I may have accidentally put Mr. Bear in the bag of toys we gave to charity.
I tried to track him, but he's been given away.
You gave away Mr. Bear?
Officer, arrest this man.
- Steph, I'm really sorry.
- How could you do this to me?
Steph, how many of these posters are you gonna make?
I'm gonna put one on every telephone pole in America.
I've gotta find Mr. Bear.
Steph, why don't we try talking about something else besides Mr. Bear?
Okay, let's talk about Joey.
Why'd he give away Mr. Bear?
Don't blame Joey.
Accidents happen.
Like, remember the time you lost my pillow person?
He was so cute.
He had dangling arms and legs.
I was mad at you for losing him, but then I got over it.
I grew up.
I moved on.
I found your pillow person under my mattress.
My pillow person!
Oh, I thought I'd never see you again!
I mean, what a pleasant surprise.
Hi, girls.
Steph, I feel terrible about this Mr. Bear thing.
- Is there a way I can make it up to you?
- Remember what Mr. Bear looked like?
- Well, yeah, sure.
- Then grab a crayon.
Pass me a brown.
- Jesse, do I wanna come in there?
- Yep, come on in.
You're gonna love it.
- Well?
- I do love it.
This is great.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Never hug me in front of my power tools.
Stephanie, come meet some new friends.
Stephanie's on her way down.
Oh, there's my baby.
Give Grandma a great big kiss.
Toys!
Nice seeing you too, sweetheart.
- My bear.
- Oh, no, honey.
Stephanie picks first, okay?
I hope this works.
Steph's really taking this hard.
I realize she's attached to this thing, but it's just a stuffed animal.
Oh, just a stuffed animal.
Do you remember Doggy Katsopolis?
Not in front of people, huh?
Doggy Katsopolis?
Come on, Dad.
Let's go in the kitchen and work with our hands.
You loved that stuffed mutt.
You'd throw him around the room for hours.
I didn't throw him.
He flew.
- Your little Doggy Katsopolis had wings?
- Don't be stupid.
He flew by flapping his little ears.
Hi, Grandma.
Hi, Grandpa.
Hi, honey.
Hi, honey.
Hi, honey.
Look what Grandpa Nick and I brought you.
Some new friends.
Why don't you get to know them?
All right, I'll give it a try.
Let me ask you guys a question.
If D.J. was picking on me, what would you do?
Anybody?
These guys are duds.
- Hi, Steph.
- You found him!
- Steph, let me explain-- - Mr. Bear, you had me worried half to-- Who is this?
The real Mr. Bear had a little scar where I closed the toy box on his nose.
- This bear is an imposter.
- Steph, wait.
I couldn't find Mr. Bear but I found Mr. Bear's successful twin brother, Dr. Bear.
Sorry, Joey.
Could you take him back to the store?
Looking at that face is just too painful.
I tried.
Danny, we gotta snap the kid out of this.
I can't understand why she's so attached to that bear.
Well, I guess we better bring these back too.
Too late, Grandpa.
My bear.
Steph, I know you miss Mr. Bear, but it's not like you're all alone in the world.
You still got us.
I guess so.
Okay, young lady.
I'm tired of this moping around.
Come out here and you lay one of those killer smiles on me.
Okay, come on.
Steph, a real smile.
Mr. Bear would want you to be happy because that's the kind of bear he was, right?
Wherever Mr. Bear went, I'm sure he's bringing happiness to some other kid.
That's true.
He was very good at that.
He's been making me happy since I met him.
I remember the exact day.
It was when Mom came home from the hospital with our baby sister, Michelle.
That's right.
She gave D.J. a charm bracelet and she gave you Mr. Bear.
That's why Mr. Bear is important to you because he was a present from Mom?
Oh, yeah.
I forgot Mom gave me Mr. Bear.
That must be why I love him so much.
You know, after Mom died I could remember everything about her.
How she looked.
Her voice.
The way her perfume smelled.
She used to sing to us at bedtime.
Now, it's getting harder and harder to remember.
Daddy, am I gonna forget all about Mama?
No, honey.
Listen, at first, after the car accident we talked about your mom all the time.
But lately, well.
Maybe the reason we haven't talked about your mom is because we're afraid it'd bring that pain back.
Maybe so.
Know what, girls?
You know what I do when I start to miss Pam and I'm feeling sad and stuff?
I just think about all the good times.
She was a great sister.
I remember my first junior high school dance.
Thanks to John Travolta, I had to get a white suit and learn The Hustle.
She worked with me the whole weekend.
Forty-eight hours of dancing to "Disco Inferno".
She must have really loved me.
God, I loved her.
And your mom had that great laugh.
It was contagious.
Every time I'd work on new material, I'd bring her down to the club.
Used to set her right in the front row.
Pretty soon she'd start laughing then she'd have the whole place cracking up.
It was great.
I remember her laugh.
Like, every time we sang that silly song with Mom.
Oh, yeah.
On top of spaghetti All covered with cheese I lost my poor meatball When somebody sneezed  You see?
You girls don't ever have to worry about forgetting your mom because you can think about those happy times whenever you want.
That's right.
See the key thing is to keep happy memories of Pam in our hearts.
That way, she'll always be with us.
You know another thing that helps me remember?
I see so much of Pam in you three girls.
D.J., everything you do you try to be the best at.
- That's just like your mom.
- What about me?
You know how you get so excited about everything?
Yeah, yeah!
- That's exactly like your mom.
- All right!
Hey, let's not forget little Michelle.
Every time I see this kid giggle, I think of Pam.
It's good that we remember Mommy because we have to tell Michelle what she was like.
You know what I'm thinking, girls?
It's been a long time since we watched those home movies of Danny's.
What do you say?
You guys wanna go look at them?
- Yeah, let's go watch them.
- Can we do it now?
Are you kidding?
If spring-cleaning is my Christmas home movies are my New Year's Eve.
Come on.
I shot this the day your mom came home from the hospital with Michelle.
All right, you guys wait right there.
Danny, get that thing out of my face.
- Smile, Jesse.
- Cut, please-- Maybe I should grow my hair long again, huh?
Nah.
Get this.
Okay, Pammy, you can come in now.
Hey, anybody order a pizza?
Give me my baby, Joey.
You're not a pizza, Michelle.
No, you're a big, beautiful meatball.
Steph, Deej, don't go away.
We got presents for you out in the car.
- Michelle.
- Isn't she pretty?
- Hi, Michelle.
- Mom looks like you, D.J.
She looks like you too.
Oh, what a beautiful baby.
Good news, Danny.
She doesn't look a thing like you.
Don't worry, in a few years from now, you'll laugh at that.
Wrong.
Danny, get a close-up of this gorgeous little face.
Not me, the baby, huh?
Say, "Hi, Daddy.
Hi, Daddy".
Baby!
- Michelle, that's you.
- No.
- Yes.
- Cute baby.
Look, there's Mr. Bear!
Mr. Bear.
In addition to your new beautiful baby sister, you've won something else.
- Presents!
- Look how young Mr. Bear looks.
Great, Joey.
Nice presents.
Mr. Bear?
It's you!
It's really you!
All right.
- Michelle, did you hide Mr. Bear?
- Yes.
- How could you do this to me?
- I don't know.
Joey, I'm sorry I blamed you.
That doesn't matter.
All that matters is the bear is back.
- Yeah.
D.J.: Right.
Look at this.
I'm so glad you're home.
I'm so glad you're both home.
Now we have the three most wonderful daughters in the whole world.
Isn't Mom beautiful?
See your uncle there?
DANNY : She has my nose.
Hi.
Wave to Daddy.
Hi, Daddy.
We love you.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Let's see your tummy.
Let me see it.
Oh, my gosh, you're getting fatter than your Uncle Jesse.
Quick!
Put the sweater on.
No, I do it.
- Are you sure you don't want any help?
- No, I do it.
Oh, feeling a little independent, are you?
Okay, that's fine with me.
I'll just sit down and catch up on my Dr. Seuss.
Help!
Come here, you.
All right, quick.
We gotta put the hand through there then the head through there.
Then we put this there.
And then.
Gosh, I told you it was a two-man job.
I did it.
Well, I helped.
I did it.
- I did it.
- No, I did it.
No, I did it.
So, Jess, any thoughts on that muffler commercial yet?
No, but I found something very interesting.
If you shake a pencil just right, it looks like it turns to rubber, see?
Hey, you guys working?
No.
Snitch.
Oh, man, I love this time of year.
First spring-cleaning, and now it's income tax time.
I get it.
Hello.
Hi, lady.
I went poo-poo in the potty.
I hope that's a wrong number.
Will you give me that, huh?
Double J Creative Services, J-- Oh, yeah, he's right here.
Can I say who's calling?
Hold on a second.
Joey, it's a Patty Fogerty.
- Patty?
- Fogerty?
Hold on, please.
Who is Patty?
Fogerty?
She's my old girlfriend from college.
I can't talk to her.
- Joey, say hello.
- Jess, you don't understand.
Patty was the one.
I was gonna ask her to marry me.
Until she walked out on you.
No phone call.
No goodbye.
She left me a note.
On her new boyfriend's stationery.
- Ouch.
- Face it, Joey.
She ripped out your heart, and threw it on the ground and did the Mexican hat dance on it.
Oh, look, here he is now.
- Talk.
- Don't worry, I'll talk to her.
But I'm not going to see her.
Hello, Patricia.
Come on over.
My address is 1882 Girard.
I'll see you tonight at 7.
All right.
Hey, she said "please".
Why don't you just leave your heart on the doorstep so she can wipe her feet on it.
Can't you see this was the great love of his life?
Man, we're talking about romance here.
Besides, my boy can make his own decisions.
Now, what you'll do is, you see her.
You tell her everything you wanted to say.
Then you sweep her right off her feet.
See, he can make his own mind up.
As you can see, I have here an empty tube.
Michelle, say the magic words.
Please and thank you.
Ta-da!
Yay.
Good magic.
Let me do the trick you taught me.
And now, the ball of mystery.
D.J., you dropped your ball of mystery.
- Thanks.
- Hey.
So I have three hands.
So what?
Let's get back to some real magic.
I need two volunteers.
Me, me.
I'll pick you and you.
Aw, nuts.
I have here a pair of solid steel handcuffs.
Now, have we ever met before?
Unfortunately, we have.
I place the handcuffs on my two lovely volunteers.
D.J.: This better work.
Now, I take the magic scarf and place it over the handcuffs.
Let me make sure they're good and tight.
Okay.
Presto change-o!
You're free.
I'll go home and get the key.
If your dad finds out, he'll call my mom.
She'll tell my brother I took his magic set and he'll make my life disappear.
He already made your brain disappear.
Still doing your taxes?
Why don't you fill out the short form?
- It took me 10 minutes.
- You wouldn't ask such questions if you would take the time to read your tax codes.
Study, learn, save.
Snooze.
You may be entitled to a refund of hundreds, maybe thousands of dollars.
Give me that book.
Whoa.
Well, what do you think?
Joey, don't try to impress her.
What?
I just want to show her what she gave up 10 years ago.
Yeah.
- I don't know if I can-- - No, no.
Do everything we worked on.
Be cool, be smooth, be a heartbreaker.
Okay.
Go get them, killer.
Joseph, the fly, the fly.
Joey.
Hi.
Hi, Patty.
You look great.
Did you bring back my Peter Frampton album?
You're still making me laugh.
This is my roommate, Jesse Katsopolis.
- Hi.
How are you?
- Hi.
- Fine.
- Joey's told me so much about you.
Nothing specific, you know, mostly good things.
They were vague.
But good things.
Who is this woman?
Patty, you remember Danny.
- Hi.
- Danny, hi.
- How you doing?
- Boy, seeing you and Joey together brings back so many memories.
I'll bet seeing you brings back a few memories for Joey too.
I think it's great you and Danny are still friends aft-- Reminiscing always makes me feel like dancing.
Patty, why don't we go down to my room.
It's kind of hard to talk in the middle of a fiesta.
Oh, come on.
You look depressed.
Cheer up.
Read the tax code.
So I moved in here to help Danny raise the three girls and everything seems to be working out great.
You haven't changed a bit.
Oh, Joey.
Patty, just out of curiosity, why are you here?
Well, I was married for a while and I just got divorced.
And I started thinking when was the last time in my life I was really happy?
When I was with you.
I just wanted to touch that part of my life again.
Yeah, there were a lot of great times.
But, Patty, come on, things-- Oh, Popeye.
You still have the doll I gave you.
Oh!
You remember the first time you did the voice for me?
Yeah, it was right after our first kiss.
Remember, I went:  You know, anytime I need a really good laugh I think about the first time I saw you.
Oh, no, not halftime at the homecoming game.
Yep.
Fifty-six thousand people waiting to see the crowning of the homecoming queen and there's this maniac streaking the full length of the football field buck-naked.
I was not buck-naked.
I was wearing high-tops and a Nixon mask.
I miss all the fun we had.
It was a lot of fun, wasn't it?
Until you walked out on me.
How could you do that to me?
You never even said goodbye.
You just took off with Michael Winchester and left me a lousy note.
Do you know how much that hurt?
Do you have any idea what you put me through?
I wanted to say goodbye, I just couldn't face you.
I'm so sorry.
I still don't know why you left me for Michael.
Because.
Despite all the fun we were having I needed some romance in my life.
I wanted someone to sweep me up in their arms and say "I love you".
I said I love you.
Yeah, as Bullwinkle, Yosemite Sam, Elmer Fudd.
I wanted to hear you say it.
I can't believe you didn't know how I felt about you.
Patty, I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you.
You know, for 10 years, I've wondered what it would feel like to hold you again.
How's it feel?
Wonderful.
I really did love you.
I don't think I ever stopped.
Doing my taxes is really neat And I'm so cool I saved all my receipts All right.
This long form's really gonna make me more money.
Let's get to it.
I found these receipts from last year.
Let's start with this one.
This is good.
This is where I took my boss to lunch.
We got two quarter-pounders and a French fry.
Now, would that be considered a "McWriteoff"?
Get it?
Come on.
"McWriteoff".
I'm sorry, Jesse.
I'm just worried about Joey.
How long does it take to say, "Patty, I never want to see you again"?
Don't worry about it.
I just hope he doesn't fall back under her spell.
See?
Nothing to worry about.
Now.
- We made it.
- Hi, guys.
Aah!
Don't do that.
- Did you get the key?
- No.
No?
The key is in Reno with my brother.
But the good news is he'll be back tomorrow morning to pick up his unemployment check.
- Girls.
- Please don't get me in trouble.
The bed.
Oh, Mr. Tanner.
I just had to come by and give you a good-night hug.
Thank you, Kimmy.
Oh, your mom called.
I don't know why, but she wants you home.
- I'll see you in the morning.
- You better.
Why are you two in the same bed?
- I love my little sis.
- And I love my big sis.
You see, I always told you this would happen.
As you get older, you're gonna grow closer and closer.
Dad, we couldn't get any closer than we are right now.
- Good night, girls.
Good night.
This is so sweet.
This is a nightmare.
What now?
I guess we go to sleep.
D.J., I can't sleep on my back.
No way.
- There.
Are you settled?
- Yes.
Are you settled?
- Yes.
Good night.
- Good night.
- D.J.?
- What?
I think I drank too much lemonade after dinner.
Oh!
Okay, Michelle, it's time to finish Uncle Jesse's taxes.
Now, Can you help me add all these numbers?
- Do you know how smart you are?
- Daddy smart too.
"Daddy smart too".
And not a witness in the room.
Danny, are we done yet?
We've been up all night.
Jesse, I am about to make you a very happy man.
According to your short form, you were getting back a measly $352 tax refund.
But thanks to using the long form, you are now entitled to.
Pay the government $48.17.
I have to pay?
I've been up all night with you.
Haven't I paid enough?
Don't worry, be happy.
Love, love Everywhere there's love Love is here Love is there Love is even hiding under the chair Ho, ho, ho Were you out all night, young man?
Yes, I was Yes, I was Were you with Patty?
Yes, I was Yes, I was Ho, ho, ho Hey, Pavarotten.
Wait up.
I want some details.
Look, Daddy.
Oh, no, Michelle, what did you do?
Table all clean.
Yes, table all clean.
Oh, I've taught you well.
But I think I've created a monster.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
It's the monster.
Then Patty and I went back to all our old hangouts we talked about all our old friends, she laughed at all my old jokes.
I've heard your old jokes.
She must be in love with you.
Joey, listen.
There's millions of fish in the sea.
Why pick the fish that you know is gonna break your heart?
Danny, I'm back with Patty.
It feels great.
Now, why can't you just be happy for me?
Well, maybe I have been a little down on this whole thing.
A little?
Don't you remember: I'm sorry, Joey.
I just don't wanna see you get hurt again.
Don't worry, this time I'm gonna do it right.
Tonight, I'm cooking Patty dinner and I am going to be Mr. Romance.
Well, actually that name's taken already.
Oh, hey, girls.
What do you want for breakfast?
We just came to say that we're not hungry.
Girls, wait a minute.
Come here.
You're wearing the exact same clothes - you were wearing yesterday.
- So is Joey.
Well, that's because I had so much fun in them yesterday that I woke up early, washed them and put them back on again.
Us too.
Hi, Tanners.
D.J., bad news.
My brother's staying in Reno for a week.
You can't get the key?
- Let me at her.
- Whoa!
Kimmy, did you handcuff my daughters together?
Boy, nothing gets by you.
All right, no problem.
Those are magic cuffs.
Had them when I was a kid.
Very simple.
I'll need an assistant.
Not you.
Kimmy?
Now, we simply place an ordinary apron over the handcuffs and the lovely and talented Miss Gibbler sticks her hands under.
And.
- Abracadabra!
- All right.
Hey, this isn't funny.
Get these off.
I don't know.
Should I take them off?
- No.
- No.
No.
- Sorry babe.
- Wait.
Don't go.
I'm stuck.
Boy, nothing gets by you.
May the magic of this moment live forever.
How sweet.
Mmm.
You know what this spaghetti reminds me of?
Come on.
Remember?
Come on.
- That's a little silly, don't you think?
- Oh, for old times' sake.
Well, Lady and The Tramp was the most romantic cartoon ever made.
Sure.
You always make me laugh.
Joey.
Let's streak.
Let's take off our clothes and run through your neighborhood.
Patty, I can't run through the streets naked.
These people have a neighborhood watch program.
I have a better idea.
- Food fight.
- Patty.
Good thing I didn't make baked potatoes.
Patty, I thought you wanted me to be romantic.
That was 10 years ago.
I came back for the old crazy Joey.
There's no old crazy Joey.
There's only this Joey.
Come on, you're still the same guy that always made me laugh.
No, I am not the same guy.
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.
You don't know anything about this Joey.
I work in advertising, I'm raising three little girls.
I have a whole new life now.
Why are you getting so upset?
I thought we were falling in love again.
So did I. But I think we're falling in love with the memories.
Patty, let's face it.
All we have is our past.
What about our future?
Joey, we're getting a second chance.
Only this time, we could have a happy ending.
I know.
Patty, you came back into my life just like I dreamed you would.
It should be perfect.
But it's not.
Let's face it.
We really don't know each other.
Yeah.
- I guess you're right.
- But in a way, it's still a happy ending.
I got to say things that I needed to say and I got to hear things that I wanted to hear.
And now when I think back about us I can feel good about it.
All of a sudden, I feel like we're strangers.
We're standing here in front of two plates of spaghetti that are getting cold.
Why don't we sit down, enjoy this beautiful dinner, get to know each other.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Okay.
Hi, I'm Joey Gladstone.
Hi.
Patricia Fogerty.
Patricia Fogerty, nice to meet you.
Do you like Italian food?
- Yes, I do.
And this looks delicious.
- Mm-hm.
The great part about it is if they don't deliver it within a half-hour, it's free.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Can I help you?
Stephie play horsy.
Stephie's very busy.
Stephie doesn't wanna play horsy.
Yes she does.
No she doesn't.
Yes she does.
No she doesn't.
Yes she does.
Okay, let's play horsy.
Yay!
How could I fall for the old crying routine?
I invented it.
Michelle.
Make a wish.
Yay!
Thank you.
Look at this, a guitar-shaped waffle.
Guys you didn't have to do this.
My birthday's no big deal.
There are presents, aren't there?
- That's from me.
- And me.
And me.
Stephanie and I signed it and Michelle stepped paint and walked on it.
We made it because we love you so much.
Well, this is the best present a guy could ever get.
Thank you, girls.
- You're welcome.
- You're welcome.
- Okay, happy birthday, Jesse.
- Look out.
What did I get?
An appointment book.
Outrageous.
Well, now you can be as organized as me.
You see, I even started filling out your "things to do" today.
Thing number one, pretend you like this gift.
It's the best appointment book I've received.
- Well, here you go partner.
- Hey, give me that.
What did I get?
An Elvis watch.
Right hand points to the hours, left hand points to the minutes.
And his hips tick off the seconds.
Sing it.
Tick, baby, tock, baby.
Tick, baby, tock, baby.
Time to buy a Cadillac.
So, old timer, how's it feel to be 26?
It feels great, folks.
This is my year, man.
Got a great family, finally got a perfect girlfriend.
Our advertising stuff's going well.
I think this is the year my band's gonna make it.
You're coming to see the band?
- Yeah.
- We wouldn't miss it.
- All right.
- Let's get dressed for school.
We have to go to school on Uncle Jesse's birthday?
Don't worry.
I'm sure there will be some kind of assembly in his honor.
Uncle Jesse, don't forget our soccer game at 3:30.
Deej, I'm the coach.
I'm there for you, babe.
Without me, you got no strategy.
No motivation.
No ride.
Get out.
- My birthday.
- Hey!
Get back here, you little gift grabber.
Give me that loot.
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.
Here, keep the appointment book.
No, thank you.
Hey, Jess, listen to this.
I think I finally came up with the lyrics to this dentist jingle.
If you need a root canal You don't have any money, pal Relax, don't sweat it Dr. Lennox gives you credit Dr. Lennox, America's top credit dentist.
And now climbing the charts, the music to this wonderful jingle.
That sounds like a dentist's drill.
Sorry, I was working on something for the gig tonight.
Don't worry.
I'm there for you, babe.
Okay, guys, I got some news.
Jesse, you get out your new appointment book.
Write down 7:30 tonight.
Sam Battersby, Smash Club.
Sam Battersby, the music critic from The San Francisco Mirror?
- That Sam Battersby?
- You bet.
He was in the studio doing a segment on the club scene.
And I talked him into coming to hear your band.
I've tried to get him forever.
How did you do it?
Well, I just used my wit, my charm and my two Giants tickets.
Danny, you're the greatest brother-in-law.
Jesse, you're hugging me.
I've been living in this house too long.
Next thing you know, you'll be filling up that appointment book.
- What's the matter, Michelle?
- Where's Jack?
Jack's in the box.
Jack, come out.
Please.
Let me see that.
All right, Jack.
Michelle and I are outside and we got you surrounded.
You come out now or we're coming in after you, sweetheart.
Jess, come on, it's already 3:20.

- I'm sorry.
We'll finish when I get back.
- Jess.
I'm sorry, Joey.
I realize it looks like I'm running out on you, but Joseph I would never do that to you.
And I'll tell you why when I get back.
You'll never get the ball past me.
- Look, Kimmy!
Jeans on sale.
- Where?
Yes, Tanner scores a goal!
Don't ever make jokes about a sale.
That's so cruel.
All right.
Come on girls.
Go, go, go!
We got a tough game today.
Let's go!

Uncle Jesse, Uncle Jesse!
Stephanie, Stephanie!
Tomorrow's my school bake sale.

How could I turn it down?
You really can't.

Oh, yeah?
Well, If I'm a chicken wing then you're a can of chicken noodle soup.
You have the brain of a paramecium.
Maybe I have the brain of a paramecium, you only have the brain of one mecium.
There's no way to beat her, is there?
No, not really.
Let's go, girls!
Come on, look alive now.
Mr. Bear, while Uncle Jesse's baking cookies for the bake sale you better let me lick the bowl.
You've put on a couple of pounds.
Yeah!

And now: on your mark, get set, bake cookies.
All right!
I'm there for you, babe.
- Hi, everybody.
- Hi.
- Happy 26th.
- Thank you.
Twenty six?
Wow!
That's more than halfway to 50.
It's all downhill from here.
Have I ever told you how much I appreciate having you around?
- No.
- Good.
So I'll give you your birthday present later.
But first here's a little preview.
If you're going to the Smash Club to watch my band you best get dressed.
Go-- Oh, thanks for inviting me.
Hold it!
Gibbler.
Too late.
She's already home trying on new outfits.
I'll go get changed.
You just bake, baby, bake.
When should I pick you up for the wedding?
- What wedding?
- Don't tell me you forgot.
Oh, why would I forget your cousin's wedding?
Niece's?
Old roommate's?
Hair dresser?
It's my Uncle's first wife's son-in-law.
That was my next guess.
Don't worry, I'm there for you, babe.
Jess, you gotta write the music to this dentist jingle.
I really need your help.
My car is starting to sound like my Uncle Fred.
It is!
It's going: I mean, my car needs a mechanic and my Uncle Fred needs a vaporizer.
Don't worry.
I'll get to your car.
We'll do the jingle.
I'm gonna cook Stephanie's cookies tomorrow.
But right now, Elvis's hands are telling me it's 5 to 6 and I gotta be down at the Smash Club at 6:15.
See you boys and girls later.
Oh, hi.
I'm Danny Tanner.
I talked to you about bringing my daughters to see their uncle play on his birthday.
- Thanks.
- Hey, not so fast.
Aren't you forgetting something?
Oh, right.
Here's your two Giants tickets.
I may never see a game.
- This place is so rad.
- Yeah!
Look at all these cute guys.
At least no one's wearing my outfit.
Hey, Jess, we're over here.
Oh, Jesse, good look.
Bon Jovi have a garage sale?
Danny, not a good time for jokes.
Jesse's band didn't show up.
I'm such an idiot.
I double booked us.
The band's playing a Holiday Inn in Sacramento.
I could have sworn I cancelled that.
I'm confused.
So many things going on with the kids and work.
- I can't keep track of everything.
- Tough break.
Anybody wanna see a movie?
Hey, Katsopolis.
- Yes, sir.
- Time's up.
I don't care where your band is.
Start playing.
By myself?
Come here.
You see that guy?
That's Sam Battersby.
His reviews could make you or break you.
Me, I could just break you.
- Showtime!
- Right.
So where am I gonna find a band?
We're there for you, babe.
Remember, it's one of the easiest songs ever written.
Okay, it's two chords.
E, A, E, A. - We can do it.
You ready?
- And break!
Now it's come down to this.
Jesse and The Partridge Family.
Ladies and Gentlemen, the Smash Club is proud to.
No.
The Smash Club is contractually obligated - to present Jesse and?
- These other guys.
Jesse and these other guys.
- All right, how you doing San Francisco?
!
- All right!
Yeah!
- You guys ready to Rock and Roll?
- Yeah!
I hope we are.
Rock and Roll!
Drum solo, D.J.!
Go, Dad, go!
Take it, Joey!
- Come on.
- This stinks.
Thank you, you beautiful audience.
One more time!
B-I-N-G-O.
Go, Bingo.
Uncle Jesse, wake up.
N-G-O!
Oh, Steph, thanks for waking me up.
I was having a horrible nightmare.
There's an article in the paper about our band.
- Oh, no, it wasn't a nightmare.
- Listen to this.
"If you missed Jesse and these other guys last night you're luckier than I am".
Wait, there's more.
"They were so bad, a room full of tone deaf metalheads were forced to flee the building".
Let me see that.
Gotta be something good in here.
Tone deaf.
Right here, see?
The bright spot of the evening.
"The bright spot of the evening was the inspired keyboard playing of the adorable Kimmy Gibbler".
Adorable?
Are you sure it doesn't say "a doorbell"?
That's it.
My career is over.
At least you have plenty of time to make my cookies for the bake sale.
- It's today.
- I'm there for you, babe.
No Jack.
Oh, Michelle, I'm sorry.
I know I promised to fix it.
Fix it now.
- Uncle Jesse!
- I'm coming, D.J. I'll be right back, Michelle.
Nuts.
You aren't dressed?
Our game's in an hour.
He can't be your coach, he's baking my cookies.
Forget the cookies.
Just grab a bunch of Oreos and scrape the name off.
All right, girls, don't worry.
Everything is under control, okay?
- I'll bake the cookies, play soccer-- - Okay, partner, dental music time.
- How you coming with that jingle?
- Let me get my keyboard.
- Hey!
- Hey!
- What about my soccer?
- What about my cookies?
What about Jack?
- Sorry, let me see that.
- Hey, Jesse I ruined my shirt, but I found my problem with my car.
Any idea why this carburetor won't work?
Yeah, it's in your hand and not under your hood.
Jess, you promised you'd help me with my car.
- And my jingle.
- And my cookies.
- And my soccer.
- And Jack.
No problem.
We got everything under control.
We'll just simply tow the car down to the soccer field and while I'm fixing the carburetor, I'll angle the side view mirror so I can see the field and coach the game and during timeouts, I'll rush into the cafeteria and bake your cookies.
And I'll swing by metal shop, cut Jack out of the box.
And, don't worry about the jingle, because I'm gonna be whistling while I work.
This is your Uncle J. I can handle this.
It may take split second timing but I can make this happen.
You can't wear a bathrobe to the wedding.
The wedding.
How can I go to the wedding?
I got soccer balls to bake I gotta tune up the dentist jingle.
Make the carburetor pop out of the box.
What's wrong with you?
!
Just because I'm 26 doesn't mean I can do 26 things at once!
Because I can't!
I can't!
Did you read our review?
Don't worry, be happy.
Your breakfast is served.
- Hey, Jesse.
- Jess.
- Hi, Uncle Jesse.
- Hi, Uncle Jesse.
- What are you doing?
- This is day one of your well-deserved one day vacation.
Your reading material.
I recommend Curious George.
It's the best monkey book ever written.
And for your viewing pleasure, complete works of The Three Stooges.
Yes, watch them mature from the silly: To the sophisticatedcertainly.
This is real nice, you guys, but I don't really deserve this.
I mean, you guys were counting on me and I let you down.
Jesse, give yourself a break.
It's great that you wanna do everything but you can't do everything at once.
Well, what about all the stuff I promised to do for you guys?
It's all taken care of.
I got us some extra time to finish our jingle.
And my cousin Sharon will keep me company at the wedding.
- Joey's coaching soccer.
- And Daddy's baking my cookies.
And Mr. Goodwrench is fixing my car.
You see, I don't wanna miss any of this stuff.
I mean, you guys count on me and I love being there for you.
I feel like I'm needed, you know?
This is my family and I'm supposed to be the world's greatest uncle.
You are.
But you still have to learn to balance your priorities.
I mean, it's great that you wanna bake cookies for Stephanie but not if it means it's gonna cost your job.
Unless you wanna be a baker.
Thank you, Stephanie.
- You're welcome.
- He was being sarcastic.
So was I. Jess, it's okay to ask for help once in a while.
We're not shy about asking you.
And besides, we're all a team here.
Thank you.
I love being part of this team.
Okay, everybody.
Dog pile on Uncle Jesse!
Oh, man.
We don't do this nearly enough.
Okay, Uncle Jesse's on vacation and we got stuff to do.
- Let's go.
- Okay, cookies-- Thanks very much.
And as soon as the wedding's over, I'm coming right back here and see if I can't get you totally relaxed.
Let me just say, have mercy.
I like the way you say that.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Wake up Jack.
Hey, I'm sorry, babe, but your Uncle J. is on vacation.
I love you.
And I love you too.
Thank you.
Come here.
Let's see if we can get that old box working.
- All right, are you ready?
- Yes.
Here we go.
See?
I told you I'm there for you, babe.
For you, babe.
No, for you, babe.
For you, babe.
For you, babe.
No, for you, babe.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Okay, Michelle, your lunch is ready.
Michelle?
What have we here?
I am a doggy.
- Well, you're a very pretty doggy.
- Daddy be doggy.
Okay.
Nice doggy.
Go get it.
All right, but I'm not sleeping outside tonight.
Go and get it.
Go get it.
Okay, Michelle, which of these two dresses do you wanna take on our trip to Lake Tahoe?
That one.
Oh, yeah, I'm looking forward to those shopping years.
All right, this suitcase should be big enough for Michelle.
Okay, Jesse.
Michelle, get out of there.
You're carryon luggage.
All right, boys, I better warn you.
You're not gonna see me much this weekend because I'm gonna spend every moment with Becky.
Jesse, this trip is for work.
Rebecca and I are doing our first show on location.
If this goes well I might get more free vacations.
Well, I just hope she can keep her mind on her work because this weekend, I'm going to tell her the three little words that every woman wants to hear.
Honey, I'm wrong.
I love you.
Jess, I am so touched.
You and Becky have been going out a long time.
You haven't told her "I love you" yet?
Well, you know how Becky is, she likes to take things slow and I didn't wanna scare her off, but I'm crazy about this girl.
I can't keep my feelings in any longer.
It's gonna be beautiful.
I'm gonna take her in my arms, passionately look into her eyes and say: Hi, is the cab here yet?
- Yeah.
We gotta go.
- Let's go.
Lake Tahoe.
Yeah.
- See you downstairs.
- Do you have everything?
Okay.
Don't forget me.
Guys, I think you forgot something.
What did we--?
Oh, Michelle.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to forget you.
I'm not mad.
- Jess, I am so excited about this trip.
- Yeah, me too.
Rebecca, this is gonna be a trip that you will never, I mean, never forget.
Tell me about it.
Todd Masters is gonna be on our show.
He is the biggest movie star I've ever interviewed.
What a hunk.
"What a hunk".
Okay, girls, this is your room.
All right!
A TV set, a dresser a bed, a phone and look, curtains.
Steph, calm down.
We have all this at home.
Yeah, but we don't have this guy.
Sorry.
Thank you, Myron.
Welcome to the fabulous Ali Baba Hotel and Casino.
I am Mr. Santana manager of the fabulous Ali Baba Hotel and Casino.

- No problem.
Yes, the love never stops here at the fabulous Ali Baba Hotel and Casino.
Michelle, tomorrow you will be in the fabulous Ali Baba Hotel and Casino daycare center.
Flabulous.
"Flabulous".
And guess what.
They have a TV there!
So who are you gonna watch tomorrow morning at 9:OO?
Gilligan!
Gilligan?
Oh, Michelle, aren't you gonna watch Daddy's show?
Gilligan funny.
Aw, come on, Michelle.
Haven't you caught on by now?
They're never getting off that island.
All right, who wants a good-night kiss?
Me, me, me.
Me, me, me.
All right.
Ready?
Michelle, go give your sisters a kiss good night.
How you doing?
Pretty good.
Jess, let's get down to the showroom.
We can still catch Harem Bare'em '89.
I'm not interested, Joseph.
I'm gonna spend the evening with Rebecca by the lake, counting stars.
Jesse, don't count on her.
She has to prepare for our show tomorrow.
Oh, really?
Observe the power of love.
- Hello.
- Hello, baby.
Hey, hey.
No, it's Jesse.
Don't hang up.
All right, Becky, how's this sound?
A romantic moonlit stroll by the lake.
Oh, Jess.
It sounds wonderful.
"Oh, Jess.
It sounds wonderful".
I'll be by your room in 10 minutes.
Jess, I'm sorry.
It's just I have to prepare my interview with Todd Masters.
Um, I'll take a rain check though.
Mm-hm.
We'll talk about it over breakfast.
Good night.
Actually, you know on second thought you do have a big show tomorrow.
And I think maybe it'd be best that you stay in and get some work done.
Hey-- Now, now, don't argue with me, young lady.
I mean it.
Okay?
Danny, do you have those notes on the Todd Masters introduction?
Thanks.
See you in the morning.
Who is this?
Leave me alone.
- Come on, let's go catch the show.
- I like this one better.
Okay, Loretta's gonna check my makeup, you girls have a seat.
Wake up, San Francisco.
I'm Danny Tanner.
And I'm Rebecca Donaldson.
And our guests today are George Michael Patrick Swayze and Tom Cruise.
And our two very special guests Ken and Barbie.
Oh, girls, that is so cute.
Actually, that's too cute.
Now, out of those chairs before I'm out of a job.
Okay.
We'll go play with those slot machines.
- They look like fun.
- Just a minute, honey.
It's against the law to play those machines unless you're over 21.
Now, why don't you and D.J. have a seat over here.
This is my first live audience.
I need you guys to cheer me on.
Hey, we're there for you, babe.
Danny, I'm sorry I'm late.
We were supposed to have breakfast together.
- Didn't Danny give you my message?
- Not yet.
Jess, Becky can't make it.
She has a breakfast meeting with Todd Masters.
How could you do this?
- Well, I've been nervous about the show.
- Not you.
- You.
- Jess, I'm really sorry.
But we'll have to talk about this later.
Danny, we go on the air in a minute.
- What's going on here?
- She's just excited to meet a movie star.
I mean, suppose you could spend some time with Michelle Pfeiffer.
What would you do?
Becky wouldn't dare.
Two, one.
Wake up!
Wake up, San Francisco, I'm Danny Tanner.
And I'm Rebecca Donaldson.
Welcome to a very special edition of Wake Up San Francisco.
Live from the fabulous Ali Baba Hotel and Casino.
Fabulous!
You folks are in for a very special treat.
Our first guest is one of the biggest movie stars in Hollywood.
I don't think I need to say anything but two words Todd Masters.
Hi, Danny.
Nice to see you again, Rebecca.
Ladies, I did something this morning with Todd that every woman in America fantasizes about.
Whoa!
We ate breakfast together.
And now I know why breakfast is the most important meal of the day.
Well, we'll be back with more of "My Breakfast with Todd" after a word from the people who pay for my breakfast.
Let's go see what's going on!
Joey, did you see the way Becky's drooling all over Todd Masters?
I'm gonna go upstairs and join Michelle in the daycare center and catch the last half of Gilligan.
Joey, check it out!
A lady just won a ton of money.
I wish we could play.
Settle down, girls.
Let me tell you something about gambling.
Most of these people lose.
I don't hear anyone screaming, "I lost, I lost"!
Well, girls, stay behind the ropes and watch as I teach you how stupid it is to gamble.
- You won!
You won!
- All right, Joey!
Two dollars!
Girls, first rule of gambling: Never be fooled by beginner's luck.
- Whoa, 10 dollars!
All right!
- Yeah!
Girls, second rule of gambling: Don't quit while you're hot.
Come on, baby.
Joey needs a new pair of shoes.
Orange, orange, orange!
Yes!
Twenty dollars worth of juice!
Don't stop now.
If you get four sevens, you can win $100,000.
Girls, I'm gonna get one of those change buckets.
You stay here, guard my machines with your lives.
If anybody goes near it, scream.
Because I'm hot, I'm burning I'm wasting time.
Yes!
Oh, I can't take it.
It's driving me crazy.
- I've got to play that machine.
- Here.
- Use my silver dollar.
- Oh, thanks, Steph.
If we win any money, I'll split it.
Now, is the coast is clear?
- The coast is clear.
- All right.
Yes!
Hurry!
Joey's gonna be back.
That's one seven, that's two sevens that's three sevens!
Yes!
We won!
We won!
- We won!
Yes!
- We won!
Girls, what happened?
Who won my $100,000 jackpot?
- I did.
- With my silver dollar.
- We'll split it three ways.
- Start jumping up and down.
- Yes!
Yes!
- We won!
We won!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
We're back live from Lake Tahoe where somebody has just won the big jackpot.
Come on, Perry, we're going back into the casino.
- This is what live television is all about.
- Dad, Joey won the big jackpot.
You hear that ladies and gentlemen?
Joey just won-- Joey?
Our Joey?
My Joey?
Oh, my God!
Perry, Perry!
Joey!
Joey!
Joey, you won the jackpot?
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Oh, sorry, Perry.
Sorry.
Joey, you've been broke your entire life.
How does it feel to win $100,000?
- Well-- - It feels unbelievable.
I mean, not that I would know personally, but-- This has to be the raddest day of Joey's life.
I'm going to Disneyland.
What the heck, I'm gonna buy it.
Congratulations, congratulations, congratulations!
Yes, everyone's a winner here at the fabulous Ali Baba Hotel and Casino.
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
I'm really sorry about Danny running off with the camera like that.
Well, that's all right.
I'm having fun here with you.
As a matter of fact why don't we continue our breakfast at dinner tonight?
Oh, well, thanks, Todd.
But I have a boyfriend and I'm really crazy about him.
He's a very lucky guy.
I tell you what, why don't I take both of you out to dinner.
- That's very sweet of you.
- Great.
It's a date.
I'll have my driver pick you up at 7.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What the hell's going on here?
You're going to dinner with this joker?
- Jess-- - No, no, hey.
No, I understand.
Good-looking guy comes to town, goes on your show he hits on you, you're all over him like a cheap suit.
Is this guy really that big a deal?
Ooh.
Knock it off.
- Jesse, please.
- How would you like it if I hit on every incredibly gorgeous blond that walks by me?
Excuse me.
Hi.
I'd like to see you tonight.
You can cook me dinner, I'll cook you breakfast and in between, babe, we'll just cook.
Get out of my face, you creep.
Well, we're heading back to the stage and nobody's here.
We'll talk about this later.
We'll talk about this now.
Oh, here they are.
What a pleasant surprise, my brother-in-law, Jesse.
Right in the middle of the most important broadcast of my career.
- Welcome, Jesse.
- Thank you.
How could you do this to me?
This was supposed to be our weekend.
Could we have this discussion during the next commercial?
No, we're talking about our relationship.
It's much more important than some stupid talk show.
This is my brother-in-law.
I love him dearly.
Security!
- What's going through your mind?
- You're making a fool of yourself.
Sit down, funboy.
Jesse, Todd is right.
You're making a really big mistake.
Oh, really?
Good!
Then this is the last mistake I make with you because we're breaking up.
- Well, fine.
Then, it's over.
- Well, fine!
You're looking at a free man.
Whoa.
Well, you won't see that on Gilligan's Island.
With my share of the jackpot I'm gonna buy a ranch full of horses, a red Corvette.
I'm gonna buy my own jet plane.
That bus takes forever to get to school.
Now, girls, when Mr. Fabulous comes here to give me my check for a hundred grand, just let me do the talking.
As long as you let us do the spending.
Hey, hey, hey.
Mr. Lucky!
Oh, man, come with me into the casino and help me pick a slot machine.
Let D.J. pick it.
She won the jackpot.
Steph.
D.J. won?
Joey, you let the girls gamble?
No, I had nothing to do with it.
I was getting a money bucket.
You girls were gambling after I told you not to?
I'm not happy about this at all.
Would $10,000 cheer you up?
You girls won that money illegally and you can't accept it.
Well, there is a bright side to this.
I can accept it.
You didn't really win that money either.
Well, no, not technically.
But if the girls hadn't jumped in there, the next pull would've been mine, and-- Don't shake your head "no".
I've got a case.
Yes, I do.
Read my head.
Mr. Gladstone, just the gentleman I need to chat with.
Well, before you give me my $100,000, I'd like to tell you a funny story.
You see, I was playing the machine and I stepped away for a minute a second, heck, a microsecond.
Well, I told the girls here to guard my machine which they did by putting a silver dollar over the coin slot which accidentally fell into the coin slot.
I couldn't accept the money without clearing my conscience.
But I feel great now, so lay it on me.
- What's this?
- A video cassette.
Our security camera got a nice clean shot of the children gambling.
You didn't come into the picture until many, many microseconds later.
I'm not getting the money, am I?
No.
But you can keep the video cassette as a souvenir of not having won the jackpot here at the fabulous Ali Baba Hotel and Casino.
- Do you hate us, Joey?
- No.
Don't be silly, girls.
I love you very much.
But we cost you $100,000.
Is there any way we can make it up to you?
No, I don't think so.
Mom, I have never been so embarrassed in my life.
I never wanna talk to Jesse again.
He is the most obstinate, pig-headed--   Becky.
- Oh, Mom, that's him.
I gotta go.
What am I doing?
Talk.
I'm listening.
There's a maid, a bellhop and some guy getting ice staring at me.
Since when does an audience bother you?
Hey, I just came by here to tell you something.
It was not my fault.
And the fact that we broke up is all your fault.
You're absolutely right, Jess.
It is my fault.
I met Todd Masters.
I watched him eat scrambled eggs and then I did the only logical thing: I threw our whole relationship out the window.
Don't turn it around.
You were going to dinner with this blow-dried side of beef.
You don't even know what you're talking about.
There you go-- - I know what I'm talking about!
- No, you don't!
We've been going out, some clown comes in and you go to dinner with him?
- Yes, you were!
- No, I wasn't!
- Let me tell you something.
- What--?
- No, I wasn't!
- Yes, you were!
No, I wasn't.
If you think kissing me's gonna solve this you've been watching too many old movies.
And the blow-dried side of beef and I were gonna have dinner tonight with you.
If you didn't lose your temper and act like a jealous maniac I could've told you that in the first place.
Whoa, I'm a jerk.
So what you're saying is that.
That I broke up with you for no reason.
Well, look who just woke up.
I'm sorry, but that's the way I am.
That's how I live my life.
If I feel something, I go with it.
I feel jealous, I act jealous.
Tell me about it.
I'm not the only one who acts jealous.
When have I ever been jealous?
How about when I hit on that waitress.
Right before she punched me admit it, you were jealous.
- Okay, maybe for a split second.
- Okay, so how does it feel?
- The worst split second of my life.
- That's what I've been feeling since I got up here.
This was gonna be the most romantic most perfect weekend.
I was gonna tell you I love you.
- I love you too.
- I had it all planned out.
We were gonna take a nice walk by the lake, under the stars-- Jesse.
- Did you hear what I said?
- Yeah, you said "I love you too".
- You love me?
- Yes.
And I love you.
Woo!
That means we're in love!
Yes!
It's about time.
Becky, I've been in love with you since the first day I saw you.
We're in love!
We gotta do something.
We have to be together all the time.
I never want to go through this again.
I wanna know that you're mine.
Now, we're in Nevada, let's get married.
Jess, do you know what you just said?
Yes.
Yeah.
We're in Nevada, let's get married right now.
Today.
I don't know what to say.
Rebecca Donaldson I love you.
And if anything has ever been right it's you and me.
Will you marry me?
Jesse, this is so.
Yes.
Have mercy.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
This weekend, I'm going to tell her the three little words that every woman wants to hear.
I did something this morning with Todd that every woman in America fantasizes about.
And then.
It's a date.
I'll have my driver pick you up at 7.
You're making a really big mistake.
Oh, really?
This is the last mistake I make with you because we're breaking up.
Well, fine.
Then, it's over.
And the blow-dried side of beef and I were gonna have dinner tonight with you.
I'm a jerk.
- I was gonna tell you that I love you.
- I love you too.
That means we're in love!
Yes!
We're in Nevada, let's get married right now.
Today.
I don't know what to say.
Will you marry me?
What will happen?
I don't know.
Will you marry me?
Jesse, this is so.
Yes.
Have mercy.
- We gotta get married right now.
- Wait a minute.
Right now?
Yes, we declared our love.
You said you'd marry me.
We're in Nevada.
- Let's do it!
- Jesse.
Jesse, hold on a second.
This is crazy.
I never do things like this.
I always do things like this.
I love this.
Here.
Sit down.
Now, we gotta find a place to get married.
I need a phone book.
Here we go.
Now, what am I looking for?
Place.
P. P-L.
There's no wedding chapels here in Neva-- Wedding chapel, as in W. I promise I'll be much smarter once we get married.
I've gotta get my hair done, find a dress, a place to have the reception.
Look at this: "The Ali Baba Hotel and Casino Wedding Chapel".
Perfect, we can get married here in the hotel.
Okay, I've gotta call my mom, dad, Connie, Corky.
I better make a list.
Hello, this is Jesse Katsopolis, and I'm madly, I repeat madly in love with Rebecca Donaldson, and I gotta get married now.
- Jess, Jess, we'll need some flowers.
- Yes.
- And we have to hire a band.
- Okay, good.
Oh, and let's get those little matchbooks that say "Jesse and Rebecca".
- I'm gonna need at least six months.
- Great.
They can take us in an hour.
- An hour?
- Yes.
- Jesse, are you crazy?
That's insane.
- This is magic, this is passion.
Man, this is spontaneity.
Look, we don't need a big wedding with all kinds of people.
Rebecca, all that matters is you and me and our pledging our love to each other.
When you put it that way, it does sound romantic.
It will be.
After we're married, we'll throw a party, invite our friends and family and a few others that might bring us really nice gifts.
But until we say "I do," this will be our little secret, okay?
- Okay.
- All right.
Jess, I just can't believe we're gonna do this.
I feel like I'm flying.
Well, fasten your seat belt, babe, because we're about to take off.
Come in.
Why say "come in" when you don't mean it?
You guys ready to go horseback riding?
- Horseback--?
- No, we, no.
We can't go horseback riding because we-- What?
We're gonna run some emergency errands.
Yeah, emergency errands.
Are you guys hiding something?
- "Are you guys hiding something"?
- "Are you guys hiding something"?
I don't get it.
Well, I have an idea.
Why don't you call your dad and see if he can go horseback riding.
- Right.
Stay right here.
- It's right here.
Use my phone.
- Have fun.
- That's right, have fun.
See you later, girls.
They're up to something.
Steph, we have a mystery to solve.
Let's be detectives, like S im o n a n d S im o n. Okay.
But I get to be Simon.
Come on, baby.
Show me some similar fruit.
Fruit cocktail.
Pardon me, are you finished with that machine?
You see, I have a system.
I play a row at a time, and you're in my row.
Sorry, but I can't leave this machine.
This morning I walked away from one and the next pull won the $100,000 jackpot.
Oh, yeah.
The whole casino has been buzzing about you.
You're known as the Jackpot Jerk.
Hey, it's Joey the Jackpot Jerk.
Nice to meet you.
I'm Shirley.
See this quarter?
I'm saving it for the minute you leave that machine.
I have got a whole bucket of quarters that are gonna make me a winner.
Well, I have waited out three husbands.
And I can wait out you, honey.
- Hey, Joey.
- Hi, Danny.
Michelle, what are you all dressed up for?
Her prom.
No, I'm gonna teach Michelle to swim like a fish.
- Are you ready to be a little fishy?
- Big fishy.
Don't make me call security.
Come on, Daddy.
Swim.
Wait, Michelle, you're heading for the buffet.
Sweetie, somebody might mistake you for a jumbo shrimp.
Mr. Katsopolis.
- Doesn't anybody shake hands anymore?
- I am just so excited for you.
On behalf of the management of the fabulous Ali Baba Hotel and Casino and Wedding Chapel-- Hold it, I'm trying to keep this a secret, so we gotta.
Do you have a wedding ring?
Because we have a fabulous jewelry store here at the-- Save it, I've been there already.
- Fabulous.
- Fabulous.
Look at this.
All right, I gotta get back to Becky.
I'll see you.
It's so strange, I feel like I'm being watched.
You're getting married.
Get used to it.
- See you at 2.
- Okay.
Our very first clue.
But it's an empty bag.
But it's from a jewelry store.
There goes Becky.
Let's follow her.
Well, that's it.
That's my last quarter.
It's your machine.
How could I lose?
Well, it's simple, Shirl, you see you thought I spent my last quarter, but I didn't.
Yes.
Oh, baby, the curse is broken.
A $5 jackpot, and I am even.
Shirley, the key to responsible gambling is knowing when to walk away.
Twenty-five dollars.
Baby.
Baby.
Baby.
Hi, Becky.
- Imagine us running into you here.
- How did your secret errands go?
Well, they weren't secret errands.
They were boring errands.
In fact, I can't even remember where I went or why I'm holding this bag.
- Becky, I just talked-- Hi, girls.
- Hello.
Jess, why don't you talk to me out in the hallway where the light is better.
That's right, the light is better.
Makes sense.
Quick, Steph, search the room.
Becky bought a new fancy dress.
And a blue headband.
Steph, look at this.
They drew a heart around the Ali Baba Wedding Chapel.
Uncle Jesse and Becky are getting married.
We solved the mystery.
Yay, we won.
We won.
Uncle Jesse and Becky are getting married?
Girls, let us in.
Don't tell Uncle Jesse and Becky we know.
Get the blue headband off.
Go, go.
Run, quick.
Go.
Hurry.
Hurry.
- What's going on in here?
- Oh, nothing.
The wind must've blew the door shut.
And locked it.
- Bye.
- Bye.
You think those two are up to something?
Uncle Jesse and Becky are getting married.
I don't know why, but they don't want us to know about it.
So we gotta keep this a secret.
Me, keep this a secret?
Do you know who you're talking to?
- Hey, we're back.
- Hi, chicks.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Michelle, how'd you like swimming in Lake Tahoe?
Water too cold.
Girls, where's your Uncle Jess?
Uncle Jesse?
Never heard of him.
Somebody has a secret.
Let's see, if we wanna get information out of these two girls I think we ought to speak to.
- Stephanie.
- Stephanie.
Okay.
Come on, honey, you were born to blab.
Come on, you know you're dying to tell somebody.
Steph, come on.
There's nothing more fun than blabbing a big, juicy secret.
- Well.
- Fight it, Steph, fight it.
Spill those secret beans.
Pardon me one moment.
Jesse getting married?
Jesse's getting married?
Blabbermouth.
What makes you think Jesse's getting married?
Uncle Jesse bought something at a jewelry store.
Becky bought a new dress.
And look, the biggest clue of all: There's a heart around the Ali Baba Wedding Chapel.
It does say 2:00 right here.
This is Jesse's handwriting.
Looks to me like Jesse and Becky are eloping.
Yeah, well, not if I can help it.
If they run off and get married like this, it will be a big mistake.
We got five minutes to put a stop to this wedding.
Jesse getting married.
I've gotta stop Jesse and Becky from eloping.
Danny, wait a minute.
You and Pam ran off and got married.
Yeah, and both of our families went crazy.
My mom cried for a month.
And I'm sure Jesse's forgetting how he felt.
He was only 13, but he was very upset.
He tried to beat me up.
Danny, he did beat you up.
Yeah, well, if you call a fractured rib beat up.
You know what you're doing?
You know what you're wearing?
Come on, let's go.
- I'm with her.
- Follow Michelle.
When did Michelle take over?
By the power vested in me by the fabulous state of Nevada I now pronounce you husband and-- Stop.
You're making a horrible mistake.
I feel like a total idiot.
Well, you know what they say.
Clothes make the man.
Thank you very much.
Have a happy life together.
If you hurry, you can have your parking validated at the front desk.
- What are you guys doing here?
- Jesse, don't do this.
I'm trying to save you from making the same mistake I made.
Don't you remember how angry you were when I eloped with your sister?
Yeah, I beat you up.
And I may do it again.
We were gonna tell all of you tonight and throw a big party when we got home.
- Yeah.
- I don't mean to rush everybody but the Koppelmans have the chapel in 15 minutes.
Make that 12.
- All right, we better get going.
- Look, I'm sorry.
I just had to get that off my chest.
I want you both to know I love you very much and I wish you nothing but happiness.
Thank you, Danny.
Come on, the Koppelmans are breathing down your neck.
Get married already.
You are all here, I want you to stay.
This is my wedding day.
All right.
- You girls wanna be my bridesmaids?
- Oh, yeah.
And I want you two boys to be my best man-- Best men.
Yeah.
Well, it's a good thing I wore my formal cabana suit.
Folks, all this chitchat is cutting into your 12 minutes, which is now eight.
Princess, you're going to be our little flower girl.
Music.
Places, everybody, places.
- This is it.
- I guess so.
- I love you.
- I love you too.
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here at the fabulous Ali Baba Hotel and Casino Wedding Chapel to share with these two people their commitment to journey together wherever life's roads may take them.
Where are you going?
We're gonna stay here in San Francisco.
It means we'll always be together.
- Go ahead.
Thanks.
- Well, wait a minute.
What if I get a better job offer in New York?
I mean then we'd have to move.
Excuse us one second.
Come here.
What do you mean, New York?
It's just hypothetical.
I mean, it could be Los Angeles, Chicago, anywhere.
I just meant wherever life's journey takes me, we go together.
What's wrong with San Francisco?
My family's there my band, my advertising career.
Five minutes.
No pressure.
We'll talk about it on the honeymoon, okay?
Hurry up, people.
Hurry up.
Today, you begin your first day together as a family.
May your marriage be blessed with many, many children.
- And soon.
- Oh, well, not too soon.
What does "not too soon" mean to you?
Well, I don't know.
Five, 10 years.
In five or 10 years I thought we'd have five or 10 kids.
Excuse us.
We'll be right back.
Ten kids?
- What?
- I have a lot to do in my career before I have children.
You're so good with kids.
- You'll make a great mother.
- When I'm ready.
Don't I have anything to say about this?
Jess, I think we both have a lot to say about this.
Two-minute warning.
Move it, people.
We'll say it after we say "I do".
Come on.
Let's cut right to the chase.
Do you, Jesse Katsopolis, take Rebecca Donaldson to be your wedded wife, till death do you part?
Say, "I do".
- I do.
- Do you, Rebecca Donaldson take Jesse Katsopolis to be your lawfully wedded husband in sickness and health, till death do you part?
Say, "I do".
I-- I-- I think I need more time to think this over.
Think fast.
You have 45 seconds until the Koppelman wedding.
Becky.
I'm sorry, Jesse, I can't go through with this.
I do.
Jess, it's Becky, can I talk to you?
Hold on a second.
Hang on.
Yeah, come on in.
Crystal, yeah, free man now.
Saturday night?
Oh, yeah, sounds great.
Yeah, I'm really looking forward to it.
Sorry, Crystal, gotta go, got another call.
Bye, Crys.
Hey, Beck, how you doing, babe?
Good to see you.
How's it shaking?
You don't have to put on this act.
Are you saying this smile isn't sincere?
Jess, I'm really sorry about what happened.
I didn't wanna hurt you.
Please.
You hurt me?
Come on, man.
You're talking to Jesse.
I'm a fighter.
I get knocked downI'm right back up again.
I'm on-- How could you do this to me?
When you turned and walked out on me like that, it killed me.
I'm sorry, it's just that I needed time to think.
I mean, everything was happening so fast.
What's the matter with things happening fast?
Can you honestly tell me that you were ready to get married move into my place, have children, turn your whole life upside down?
That's the way I do things.
I see something, commit to it and go for it.
Jesse, we didn't even think it through.
When we were walking up the aisle and down the aisle and up the aisle and down, we discovered that we had big differences.
You know what, you're right.
Thanks for-- Thank you.
I'm glad we found this out.
You saved us from making a horrible mistake.
Thanks very much.
Jesse.
Listen to yourself.
Why does everything have to be all or nothing?
Yes, we learned that we have some differences that we need to work out.
But we also learned we have something in common.
Like what?
Like we love each other.
You still love me?
Hey, I almost married you at the fabulous Ali Baba Hotel and Casino Wedding Chapel.
Now, that is love, babe.
Oh, my God, we almost got married.
It's just that I was so excited that you finally said you loved me.
It was such a wonderful feeling.
I didn't want it to end, so I proposed.
I just didn't think about the next day or the days after.
Why did you say yes, anyway?
Are you crazy?
I'm crazy about you.
Right back at you, babe.
So can we keep getting to know each other?
Yes.
Yes.
Because when I get married, I want it to last forever.
You okay, Jesse?
Yes, I'm okay.
You can come in now.
You didn't have to send in the munchkin spy.
We were just in the girls' room, and.
Waiting for the right time to send Michelle in.
Don't worry, everything's okay.
We're not getting married but we're still in love.
All right, so let's celebrate.
Put a little music on.
Oh, I'm glad it worked out.
That's nice.
Oh, now, there's a happy song.
Hey, the Tanners can make anything happy.
