{START OF EPISODE 1}
How about a beer, chief?
How about an ID?
An ID?
That's very flattering!
Wait till I tell the missus.
Military ID.
First Sergeant Walter Keller, born 1944.
That makes you 38.
- Must've fought in Vietnam.
- Yeah.
- What was it like?
- It was gross.
Yeah, that's what they say.
War is gross.
I'm sorry, soldier.
This is the thanks we get.
Sumner, this is crazy.
Diane, we're about to be married.
Married!
Congratulations!
Let's celebrate with a drink.
I think not.
I give it six months.
Perhaps we won't have children right away.
- Come on.
Let's sit here.
- We have a plane to catch.
I insist you have my grandmother's antique gold wedding ring.
Didn't you say it's still on your ex-wife's finger?
I don't need it.
- You're enough for me.
- True.
But symbols are important.
Let me call Barbara and see if she's home.
The phone's back here.
As long as we're here, let's celebrate with some champagne.
Hello?
Sam?
Are you Sam?
- Yes.
- Yes, he's here.
Someone named Vicki.
No.
No, she knows you're here.
I told her you're here.
Well Now, look I'm sorry, I was wrong.
He had to step out.
Where?
Well, I think what happened is he he had to go to mime class.
Yes, I'll take a message.
You're welcome.
- Well?
- You're a magnificent pagan beast.
Thanks.
What's the message?
Listen, I didn't like doing that.
I'm sorry.
If I didn't own this place, I'd fire me on the spot.
For lying for me, I'll buy you your first drink.
I'd like a bottle of your best champagne.
It wasn't that great a lie.
- No, we'll pay for it.
- We're on our way to get married.
Then this is on me.
Congratulations.
Barbara was home.
She said I can come over.
Well, do you want me to go with you?
No, it could get a trifle sticky.
Besides, if she saw the dazzling beauty who's about to succeed her, it would break her heart again.
Sumner, I'm not beautiful.
Blasphemy.
So where's the ceremony gonna be?
- Tomorrow, in Barbados.
- Nice.
I'm Dr Sumner Sloane, Professor of World Literature at the U. He has an article in Harper's.
Diane's been my teaching assistant for two years.
Today, I was sitting in my office with Diane.
I looked up from my Proust, she had her nose in her Yeats.
I said to myself, "I would be crazy to let this girl get out of my life".
So, right there on the spot, I said, "Let's get married".
What he actually said was, "Come with me and be my love, and we will some new pleasures prove".
- That's Donne.
- I certainly hope so.
No.
John Donne, the poet.
Well, that's lovely.
Listen, I must dash.
I'll be back in ten minutes.
- Excuse me, what's your name?
- Sam.
Listen, Sam, old man, I have an errand to run.
Diane will stay here.
I'd appreciate it if you would keep an eye on her.
For you, Sumner, old man, I'll keep both my eyes on her.
Sumner, am I stupid to let you go see a woman you were once in love with?
Darling, I'm leaving you alone in a bar.
- Which one of us is the stupider?
- Too close to call.
In any case, you sit at the bar and chat with Sam while I'm gone.
I'll be back before you know it with your wedding ring.
He's quite a fella, your fiancé.
Listen, you don't have to make conversation with me.
I'm not in the habit of talking with bartenders.
I understand.
One's trying to move into my neighbourhood.
Call that a football team?
- What's wrong, Coach?
- The Patriots did it again.
This is the worst draft yet.
They got a first-round pick.
Did they get a jackrabbit for the backfield?
No.
A gunslinger at quarterback?
No.
A linebacker they get.
I've seen a good linebacker turn a team around.
Yeah, me, too.
- Hi.
- Hello.
I hope nobody told you the bus goes by here.
She'll be here for a while.
Excuse me.
I hate to keep asking for special attention, but could you not discuss my private life with everyone?
- What would you like me to tell him?
- I don't care.
- She's a hooker.
- Yeah?
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.
- Carla's late again.
- Nuts.
OK, I'm late!
My kid was throwing up all over the place.
You don't buy that excuse, I quit.
I don't work for a man who has no compassion for my children.
And you're not exactly swamped here.
I'm usually punctual.
If you don't like it, fine.
This ain't such a great job.
I'm gonna change.
Think I was too hard on her?
- Hiya, Coach.
- Hi, Carla.
Patriots finally got the linebacker they needed.
Are you nuts?
They're up to their ears in linebackers!
That's true.
They do have a lot.
I love to see a woman who isn't afraid to take her luggage out for a drink.
She doesn't want to be disturbed.
Well, tell Her Nibs I'm sorry.
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!
- Norm, what do you know?
- Not enough.
What do you think of the Patriots' draft?
They need linebackers like I need antlers.
That new linebacker will put 'em in the Super Bowl.
He'll probably do that.
I got an awful headache.
Sox lost again today, Sam.
Sure could have used you.
Not in the shape I'm in, Norm.
You, miss!
Wouldn't you love to see Sammy flinging the horsehide?
Flinging what?
Don't you know who he is?
He was one of the best pitchers in baseball.
Samuel "Mayday" Malone.
I coached this kid in double-A ball, and with the Red Sox.
He was one of the best Little Leaguers ever.
- Take it easy, Coach.
- No, I mean it, he was the best.
- Sure as the earth is round.
- You don't believe that.
I didn't until I saw those pictures from the space shuttle.
Sam once struck out Cash, Kaline and Freehan with a tying run on second.
How long is the wimp convention in town?
Carla, heel.
If you were so good, why aren't you still playing?
I developed an elbow problem.
I bent it too much.
You were a drunk?
Are you kidding?
He was a great drunk.
Anything he did, it was great.
I was not a great drunk.
I was a good drunk.
Are you drunk now?
I haven't had a drink in three years.
I'm proud you licked it, Sammy.
Must've been hell.
- Why do you own a bar?
- I bought it when I was a drunk.
I held on to it for sentimental reasons.
You, miss.
What you reading?
A book?
Excuse me.
Where is your bathroom?
Next to my bedroom.
Down the hall.
So, what's Goldilocks's story?
- Never mind.
- Come on, Sam.
- Why can't you tell us?
- Yeah, what's the big deal?
Take it easy.
Sam's shy about these things.
- I'll fill you in.
She's a hooker.
- She's not a hooker.
Well, not in the traditional sense.
She's not a hooker at all.
Finest young lady I ever met.
My head is killing me.
Look, she does not want to be bothered.
She's waiting for her fiancé.
They're going to the Caribbean to get married.
OK?
They missed you.
Another beer, Norm?
Well, yeah, one more quick one.
Thanks.
- He's not back yet?
- No.
Why don't you make a run for it?
You're a bitter little person, aren't you?
Yeah.
Well, I have a right to be.
- My husband left me with four kids.
- Four kids?
Right.
And after I paid his way through school hustling drinks.
What school did your husband go to?
The Colletti Academy.
TV repair.
So the minute he graduated, he left me.
Said I wouldn't fit in with the other repairmen's wives.
Big shot!
- He sounds like a cur.
- Yeah.
Well, he's not all bad.
He still fixes my set and only bills me for parts.
If it's my missus, I'm on my way.
Cheers.
Yeah, just a sec.
Is there an Ernie Pantusso?
- That's you, Coach.
- Speaking.
I'd like two draughts and a Scotch on the rocks.
That group's arguing about the sweatiest movie ever made.
The what?
What movie did people sweat most in?
That's easy.
Rocky II.
No, not even close.
Body Heat.
Sweat city.
Ben Hur.
The boys in that galley sweat like pigs.
Alien.
Buckets.
The night before my wedding and I'm in the middle of a sweat contest.
Speaking of sweat, here's a little-known fact.
Women have fewer sweat glands than men, but they're larger, more active.
- The human body.
- Consequently, they sweat more.
Really?
Sure.
How about you, miss?
What are your perspiration patterns?
Sumner, I'm so glad to see you.
These men have been arguing over the sweatiest movie ever made.
- Cool Hand Luke.
- That's one!
What happened to you?
It's been over an hour.
Diane, that woman is extraordinary.
- Did she give you the ring?
- I couldn't take it.
- We've got a plane to catch.
- Diane, I love you.
But when I was with Barbara, something stirred inside me.
We can talk about it on the flight.
I can't fly to Barbados this confused.
It's OK, the pilot knows the way.
I love your wit.
You're a beautiful child.
- Let's go to Barbados.
- Let's go to Barbados.
- Who isn't here?
- Me.
Cheers.
Just a minute.
If you're not, I apologise, but is your name Sumner Sloane?
Yes, it is.
Hello?
No, it's alright.
She understands and I understand.
Barbara, that's very human of you.
I'll be right over.
And, Barbara, your depth frightens me.
She insists that you have the ring.
We won't have time to catch our flight.
You call and get us on a later flight.
I'll get the ring.
- Sumner - Yes?
- How about a kiss?
- Maybe.
I'll play it by ear.
Cheer up, cookie.
He may have been in an accident.
I'm knocking off, Sam.
Home to my book.
- Still working on that novel?
- Yeah, coming on six years now.
I got a feeling I might finish it tonight.
- You're writing a novel?
- No, reading one.
Wait a second.
I want you to take Norm home.
- Norm!
- I'm up.
One quick one then I really gotta fly.
- Coach will take you home.
- I'll give you a lift.
- Goodnight, Sam.
- Goodnight.
Coach, we stop somewhere, I'll buy you a beer.
Norm, you're in here every night.
Doesn't your wife wonder where you're at?
Wonders.
Doesn't care.
Night, Sam.
Thanks for letting me bend your ear.
That's OK, Ron.
Goodnight.
You must get real tired of hearing people cry in their beer.
I wonder why people tell bartenders their problems.
- It's kind of sad, isn't it?
- Yeah.
These poor wretches with no one in the world to turn to but some stranger who mixes drinks.
I met Sumner two years ago.
I was so flattered when he went out of his way to pick me as his teaching assistant.
I'm still kind of in awe of him, you know.
He's the most brilliant man I've ever known.
For the last two years, he's been the most important thing in my life, and now I may be losing him.
Come on.
Look, you are a very attractive young lady.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Sure.
You're gonna find someone a lot better than that goofy professor.
Goofy?
Are you talking about Sumner?
- I'm talking about Sumner.
- You don't like Sumner.
I don't like Sumner.
- You know why you don't like Sumner?
- Because he's goofy.
No.
Because he's everything you're not.
He's well bred, highly educated, he's distinguished, he's urbane - You left out "goofy".
- I did not leave out "goofy"!
- You were coming to it?
- I should have expected this.
That goof will be on the cover of Saturday Review someday.
That goof is probably gonna be on a beach tomorrow, rubbing suntan oil on his ex-wife.
I've had a real rough day, and I'm now going to reward myself by getting out of here.
When Sumner comes back, will you say I've gone home?
Fine.
I forgot to change the reservations again.
- Use this one.
- Thank you.
I'd like to change the reservations for Mr and Mrs Sumner Sloane, flight 481 to Barbados.
They did?
Are you sure?
No, thank you.
- I'm sorry.
- How did you know?
Bartenders' intuition.
A shame such an astute observer of human nature is stuck behind a bar.
That's what I think.
Well, why not bring your remarkable powers to bear and enlighten me as to what my future holds?
I'm probably gonna regret this, but you could work here.
Sam.
Shut up for a second, will you?
I need I need two vodka gimlets, one straight up, one blended, rocks, Chivas rocks, soda, a Comfort Manhattan, no cherry, a white wine spritzer, an Old Bushmill Irish decaf, no sugar.
What makes you think I would ever work in a place like this?
Simple.
You can't go back to the professor for work.
I need a waitress.
You need a job.
You like the people here.
You think they like you.
And the phrase "magnificent pagan beast" has never left your mind.
Now, look, buster.
I do need a job.
And I'll find one.
And you can bet that it won't be waiting tables.
What are you qualified to do?
Nothing.
But somewhere, there is a job that I'm perfect for, that's perfect for me.
I'll find it.
And when I do, I'll know it.
Carla, what am I making?
Two vodka gimlets, one straight up, one blended, rocks, Chivas rocks, soda, a Comfort Manhattan, no cherry, a white wine spritzer with a twist, one Old Bushmill lrish decaf, hold the sugar.
Your first customers.
- Wish me luck.
- Luck.
Hello.
Welcome to Cheers.
My name is Diane.
I will be serving you.
Why don't you sit down here?
I should tell you, parenthetically, that you are the first people that I have ever served.
If anyone had told me a week ago that I would be doing this, I would have thought them insane.
When Sam offered me the job, I laughed in his face.
But then it occurred to me, here I am, I'm a student.
Not just in an academic sense, but a student of life.
And where better than here to study life in all its many facets?
People meet in bars, they part, they rejoice, they suffer.
They come here to be with their own kind.
What can I get you?
Where is police?
We have lost our luggage.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Sam, when you were in the back, one of your women called.
She said to tell you that you're a lying piece of garbage and she never wants to see you again.
Did she leave her name?
No, but she did tell me to add one more thing.
What's that?
Yeah, that's Patty.
Your move, Sammy.
Sam, I'll only ask this once.
If you say no, it's no.
But I would love to start doing caricatures of the customers here.
Caricature is a satirical form of art that the common man loves.
It would be a wonderful memento of our customers' visits here.
No.
My art instructor said I'm an original and this would be an invaluable experience.
No.
I'd only do it during the slow periods It wouldn't interfere with waiting tables.
- No.
- What do you say?
Can I do it?
- No.
- We'll talk about it later.
No, we won't talk about this later.
I don't want you to do that.
I'm going to do it anyway.
Well, at least she cleared it with me first.
Here you go, Carla.
- Gin Collins, vodka Collins.
- Thanks.
Which one's which?
The gin Collins is in Larry, the vodka Collins is in Steve.
- Coach, what are you talking about?
- Larry and Steve.
- You've named the glasses?
- How else do I know which is which?
I mean, over here is Pete, Glen, Fred, Al Not to offend the ladies, we've got Jeannie, Ginger, Gracie, Sally - How do you tell which one is which?
- To me, they're different.
Except the Wilson brothers.
Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!
- Norman.
Gentlemen, start your taps.
- How's it going?
- Not so good.
I missed a digit in the debit column today.
The boss is now using my butt for an ashtray.
Norm, would you please watch your language today?
- Sure.
What's the problem?
- Lisa's coming over.
I didn't know that.
It'll be great to see her.
Who is Lisa?
That's the Coach's daughter.
Or is it a martini glass?
- How's she doing?
- She's absolutely wonderful.
She's introducing me to her fiancé.
Great.
You never told me she was engaged.
She said she was married to her work.
Well, like most women, she wants both.
This is the 19 what, '80s?
Come here.
- Listen, are you alright?
- You see, I never met the fella.
I'm just hoping that I can hit it off with him.
- It's really been bugging me.
- Relax.
You're gonna do just fine.
Yeah, I guess I do worry too much.
Since Lisa's mother died, she's been my whole life.
Coach, you did a great job with Lisa.
Don't worry.
Thanks, Sam.
Great guy, that Sam.
Why don't you name a glass after him?
Excuse me, my name is Diane.
I'm the Cheers caricaturist.
I couldn't help but notice that you are very much in love with this lady.
And I have a sketch for you.
Which one of us is that?
That's a pretty good caricature.
Don't toy with my emotions.
I'm serious.
It looks just like her, I think.
Of course.
Yes, excuse me.
Hello.
I'm Diane, the Cheers caricaturist.
I have a drawing of you.
- Let me see.
- Just a minute.
Do you have a hobby?
- Horseback riding.
- Yes, that is fun, isn't it?
Now you may look.
This is me?
Why am I sitting on a lizard?
- Daddy!
- Lisa!
Honey, it's so good to see you.
Everybody, here's my daughter Lisa.
- Hi, Sam.
- How are you doing?
- Really good.
- You look good.
- Thanks.
- This is Diane.
- Very nice to meet you.
- You also.
Where's your fiancé?
Roy'll be right in.
He's parking the car.
So, where did you meet the guy?
We both work for the same company.
He's our top salesman.
Good for you.
That's great.
Everybody!
This is my daughter's fiancé.
Let's hear it.
Darling.
Roy, this is Carla and Diane and Sam.
- Hi.
- Hi.
And this is my father Ernie.
- A pleasure to meet you.
- The feeling's ditto.
- Can I get you a nice cold beer?
- Sure, Pops.
Mind if I smoke?
Listen, cigar smoke bothers me.
I know.
It stinks, but it tastes great.
So, Lisa tells me you and Sam were in baseball.
- That's right.
- I think it's a dead sport.
They just haven't claimed the body yet.
People need action these days.
What sport do you like?
Female full-contact karate.
Excuse me, I have to go jump-start my brain.
Look out for that one.
She could steal my heart.
Cliff, I smell Chinese food.
lt's a cigar.
So, you're a salesman with my daughter's firm?
Yeah.
Talk about coincidence.
Lisa's my district manager.
Has my fate in her hands.
I'm working Jersey now, but I'm moving up to Pennsylvania soon.
I suppose something could be arranged.
- What do you sell?
- Suits door-to-door.
Is this one of the suits here?
- You took the bait, Sam.
- I did?
Hold this.
I'm wearing an Omni suit right now, and, man, am I comfortable.
The best part is its versatility.
This suit comes with two coats, three pairs of pants and five vests.
The ensemble makes 120 combinations.
Everything from dignified to sporty.
If you owned one, you could go from a funeral to a night on the town without even going home.
Well, I was trapped in just that situation Tuesday night.
We're gonna be late for our dinner reservation.
Sam, you and I happen.
Catch you later.
Let's go put on the feedbags.
We'll be back in a little while.
Daddy, come with us.
No, you go ahead, I got something to do.
I'll see you later.
- Alright, I'll see you later.
- Alright.
You know, I am so glad that you two finally got a chance to meet.
Ciao.
Do you get it?
We're going to eat and I said ciao.
Ciao.
I'm a funny guy.
Could you cover for me for a couple of moments?
- Sure.
Where are you going?
- To toss my lunch.
Chuck, how's the job search going?
I got something.
I'm not crazy about it.
I'm a janitor at a biology lab where they do DNA experiments making mutant viruses.
- Sounds like a good job to me.
- I don't know.
Makes me a little nervous, all that weird stuff floating around.
- Don't worry about it.
- Don't sweat it.
They handle all that stuff.
You're right.
Must be getting paranoid.
See you later.
I feel better already.
Bye-bye.
- Bye.
- Take care, Chuck.
He used the phone.
The man's a pig.
I just had dinner with a pig.
He's even more disgusting when he's around food.
- That's hard to believe.
- Hard to believe?
The last thing I saw, he was pulling his chair up to a dessert cart.
- What will you do about this?
- I gave Lisa everything she wanted.
- What can I do?
- You have to tell her how you feel.
- I can no longer hold my tongue.
- Want me to do it?
Coach, come here.
I'm a daughter myself.
Let me tell you something about my father.
My father is a very wise and learned man, but he never gave himself a chance to get to know the boys I brought home.
He would decide he didn't like them for no better reason than one had bad posture or another one had facial hair.
I'll never forget when I was foolish enough to bring home a utopian socialist.
- Oh, my God!
- No!
I know, it's unbelievable.
I was a rebel then.
The point is, you mustn't make the mistake of judging too quickly.
- Now, call me crazy - You are crazy.
Very funny.
What I am struggling to say is, call me a bleeding heart You're a bleeding heart.
Call me cute as a button.
Fine.
Coach, I'm a humanist.
That means that I have to believe there's something fine and noble about every human being.
If we haven't found what's fine and noble about Roy yet, it means that we haven't looked deeply enough.
You're right.
You're absolutely right.
Your mother!
Like no one ever knocked over a dessert cart before.
How about a beer?
Look, you've gotta talk to her.
Coach, you have to give Roy a chance.
- You don't.
- That's not a bad restaurant.
The dessert guy's a dink but the cuisine was tasty.
But what am I telling you, chubs?
- Where's Lisa?
- She's upstairs settling the bill.
Are you saying you had her pay for dinner?
They wouldn't take a post-dated four-party cheque.
If they're going to be hard-nosed, they should put up a sign.
Do you still say there's something good in that?
There must be.
Roy, how about if you and I chat over here?
Good idea.
Will you excuse us for a moment?
The suit's getting to you, isn't it?
Roy, your personality is very - strong.
- Amen.
But I know that's not the real you.
You know, an aggressive personality is often a mask for a very shy and sensitive soul.
I'm willing to gamble that you are such a person.
You're not wearing a bra, are you?
The man is pond scum.
Coach?
Stop her.
Lock her in the car if you have to, but stop her.
Sam, I can't stop her.
She wants him.
Sam, I haven't forgotten about you.
How about I run to the car for cloth swatches?
I can be out there before you can scream no 700 times.
- You better be quick.
- You better be quick.
Coach, let me talk to you.
Do you remember a double-header against Cleveland on a hot August day, 1974?
Yeah, I remember part of that.
- What part?
- I remember hot.
Well, that's good.
That's a beginning.
Do you remember I was on the mound?
Johnson had been thrown out.
You filled in as manager.
It was the last inning.
I had just walked.
The base was loaded.
- Gosh, who was up?
- Charlie Spikes.
That's it.
Charlie Spikes.
Anyway, you came out to the mound to talk to me.
I was in a jam.
I didn't have any good stuff left.
I thought you were going to yank me but you didn't.
Instead, you said that something I've never forgotten.
Do you remember what you said?
What did I say?
You said, "Go get him".
- I said that?
- Yeah.
And I got him, Coach.
Well, I was glad to be there to help out.
I'm glad you were there, too.
If you hadn't said that, my career may have ended that day, instead of when it did, a couple of weeks later.
What the hell are we talking about this now for?
Go get him.
- Hi, Daddy.
- Get him.
Lisa, I want to talk to you about Roy here in Sam's office.
Go get him.
What a marvellously pithy phrase.
That's exactly what our third baseman said at the time.
I'm sorry, Lisa.
The time has come to put my foot in my mouth.
You cannot marry this man.
You absolutely, positively cannot marry this man.
I never heard you talk like this before.
Well, now you have.
I'll tell you something.
I don't like this guy Roy.
I don't like Charlie Spikes.
You can't marry either one of them.
Look, Daddy, I'm not dumb.
I know Roy's abrasive.
I know he's insensitive.
I know he's probably only marrying me so he can get Pennsylvania.
But why would you want to marry a man like this?
Isn't it obvious to you?
Nothing's ever obvious to me.
Daddy, don't make me say this.
What?
I wanna be married and I wanna have children.
Roy is the first man that asked me to marry him and I'm afraid he's gonna be the last.
Honey, there must've been dozens of young fellas that proposed to you.
No, Daddy, wake up.
Roy is the first one ever.
- But you're so beautiful, so - Beautiful?
You have been saying that I'm beautiful ever since I was a very little girl.
But look at me.
Not as my father.
Like you're looking at me for the first time.
And please try to see me as I really am.
Oh, my God, I didn't realise how much you looked like your mother.
I know.
I look exactly like her, and Mom was not comfortable about her beauty.
But that's what made her more beautiful.
Your mother grew more beautiful every day of her life.
- She was really beautiful.
- Yes, and so are you.
You're the most beautiful kid in the whole world.
Thanks, Daddy.
Go ahead.
Come on, go ahead, try it.
The man doesn't lie.
The stuff won't burn.
That's a drawback.
Roy?
About time.
What were you talking about in there?
We were talking about me.
My father thinks I'm beautiful.
Do you?
What?
Of course you're beautiful.
You're stylish, you're contemporary and you travel well.
You just said that about your suits.
Roy, I don't want to marry you.
I decided that I want a man as good as my father.
Hold on here.
What about Pennsylvania?
Roy, you don't get Pennsylvania and you don't get me.
You just get more and more obnoxious.
Look, it's not like this marriage was gonna change my life.
But I want you to know that if I walk out that door right now, I'm gone.
Do you hear what I said?
Is that what you want, Lisa?
- That's what I want.
- Then that's what you got.
Goodbye, baby.
Don't bother calling me cos we're through.
This doesn't mean we can't put you in a new suit.
You've made me so happy.
I mean it.
Care to capture this moment in a caricature?
No.
Tacky.
Come on, let's celebrate.
I'll buy you some ice cream.
Daddy, no.
I'm not in the mood for ice cream.
I just lost my fiancé.
He wasn't the greatest guy, but it'll take a while to get over it.
- Rocky Road?
- You got it.
- Can we go?
- Take off.
- I got him.
- You got him.
So long, everybody.
- Bye.
- Bye-bye, Lisa.
Lisa made the right decision.
- Forgive my storybook mentality - You're forgiven.
Well, laugh if you will.
Every woman has a Mr Right in mind.
It's a mistake to settle for anyone less.
Do you have a Mr Right in mind?
Well, I suppose I do.
Every woman does.
- What's he like?
- Come on.
No, come on, maybe I know the guy.
Maybe I know him real well Well, for one thing, he would be very intelligent.
Very well educated.
Perhaps overeducated, if there is such a thing.
Not particularly athletic, perhaps even clumsy, but charmingly so.
Blond, blue-eyed, with a Byron-like innocence.
- I know this person.
- Who?
You.
You described yourself perfectly.
I hope you'll be very happy together.
- I have had enough - Don't throw that.
That's Herbie.
He's got a wife and four little shot glasses.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
OK.
Shot of bourbon.
Beer chaser.
Bloody Mary without Tabasco, and with extra Tabasco.
Coffee.
Cream.
Sugar.
Sweet'N Low.
CC water back.
Pretzels.
Pitcher of water with three glasses.
Those are our drinks.
I'm terribly sorry.
I don't suppose I could impose upon you people to save me a few steps?
Thanks.
Thank you, really.
Thanks so much.
Free pretzels for everybody.
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!
Norman.
- Beer, Norm?
- I've heard of that stuff.
Better give me a tall one in case I like it.
- Another day, another dollar.
- 50 cents after taxes.
- Hey, Norm.
- Hey, girl.
How's the kids?
Two of them are ugly, one's obnoxious and one's just stupid.
He's my favourite.
- Get me Gus.
- Yes, sir.
Right away.
Gus who?
Don't be a wise guy.
Just get him.
Alright, yes, sir.
Norm, do you know a Gus?
- Gus who?
- He hates that question.
Gus, the owner of this bar.
I know who you mean.
That was two owners ago.
I'll never forget that guy.
He had such a great name.
Gus.
I came from Seattle to talk to him.
Gus is the man.
You got troubles, you take 'em to Gus, he straightens you up.
I've gotta be back in Seattle Thursday night.
Take it easy.
Listen, I managed in the minors, I coached in the majors, I've been a bartender for five years.
I've had my share of people with problems.
Why not give me a try?
My son comes home from college with his new fiancé, who's black.
And your son's not?
Yo, Coach.
Get Gus.
I'll make a few calls.
Good idea.
Give me a Scotch.
I'll be right back.
- Holy !
- What's the matter, Norm?
Somebody pinch me.
I've got to be hallucinating.
Look at those legs!
If they're attached to anything, even a truck, I'm gonna marry it.
Please come down here.
Please.
She's coming down here!
Alright, everybody, just act natural.
This I gotta see.
I don't believe this.
I feel like I've been transported in time back to a fraternity house in the '50s.
Come on, guys.
In this day and age, aren't we beyond ogling women?
Holy !
Norm, is that the one?
- Hi.
- Hi.
Excuse me, miss.
The gentleman at the end of the bar would like to buy you an automobile.
- May I help you?
- White wine, please.
- White wine.
- Here, allow me.
I got it.
- Thank you very much.
- You're very welcome.
Don't get your hopes up, boys.
As soon as Sam comes out here, it's dinner for two at his place.
Come on.
I hardly think that's the sort of woman Sam would go out with.
Listen, she may not be flashy enough for Sammy.
They had Sammy in mind when they built her.
Really?
I don't buy that.
I know I've only worked here a short time, but it seems to me Sam has more depth than that.
Follow me.
Sam, would you come here a second?
Carla, never disturb me unless there's a customer.
No, don't drink that.
I've got something much better.
I think you're gonna like this.
It's an amusing little wine.
You like to laugh?
- I love to laugh.
How did you know?
- Call it a hunch.
The great ones make it look so easy.
Is there chance that you and I could go someplace and laugh together?
My mother told me to watch out for guys in bars.
Well then, let's get out of this bar so you don't have to worry.
I do feel like a movie tonight.
I've been in the mood for a movie all day long.
- What kind of movie shall we see?
- Something short.
Could you be a little more specific?
Does anybody know any good movies?
What's that new Australian film that's good?
No.
No Australian films.
This one's no problem.
It's dubbed.
Will you excuse me?
Diane, can I talk to you in the poolroom?
Sure.
I'll be right back.
What's your name?
Brandee.
With two Es.
Brandee with two Es?
A big company like this, they spelled it wrong.
- OK, what was that all about?
- What was what all about?
All that laughing and stuff?
"I love to laugh".
- Diane, can we have two beers?
- Coming up.
- No.
Not right now.
- Sam, we're thirsty.
Drink chalk.
Sam, I didn't mean anything by that.
I laughed.
Life is funny.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I get the impression that you don't approve of Brandee.
Is that Brandy with a Y or two Es?
I may be the dim ex-baseball player and you're the postgraduate, but I'm the boss and I didn't hire you as a critic, - I hired you as a waitress.
- You'd never know it by me.
Beer.
With two Es.
Will you guys just sit down for a minute, please?
Thank you.
Why don't you be honest with me?
You think Brandee's dumb.
- I never said that.
- But you think she's dumb.
- I don't know that I think that.
- Diane, she's a tree stump.
Come on.
I guess she'll do until dumb comes along.
Well, thank you very much.
The truth comes out.
She's a total airhead.
- Incredible body, no mind.
- Who?
I don't think that.
To you, Brandee's a one-night woman.
Built for cheap laughs, wild times and easy sex.
- Where?
- Will you just admit it?
Sam, I've got a message for you.
Your date, Miss Bigbuckets?
She told me to tell you she's getting a little "ootsy".
Get her out.
The customers are warping the wood with their drool.
- Diane, come here.
Listen - Wait a minute.
I don't mean to criticise.
In a way, I was complimenting you.
You can do better.
I don't want to do better.
There are certain things in this life that I really like, and nobody's gonna change my mind.
I like fun women, hot dogs, game shows.
I don't care what anybody says.
Did you read they found rat parts in hot dogs?
I like rat parts.
It's my favourite part of the hot dog.
OK.
And one more thing I like.
Brandee.
I sensed something very special going on there.
So if you'll excuse me, that very special somebody is waiting for me.
Fine.
- Coach?
- Yeah?
- Where's Brandee?
- She just left with some guy.
- She what?
- Looked like the real thing, Sam.
If I see one sign that you're enjoying this, you're in trouble.
How about a couple of beers for the boys in the poolroom?
OK.
Another beer, Norm?
Yeah.
One quick one and then it's adios for sure.
Here you go.
No, it's a guy.
Coach, any word from Gus yet?
Yeah, Leo.
He can't drop by tonight.
He's dead.
- Oh, no.
- Leo, it happens.
I can't believe it.
Gus is gone?
Nobody can replace Gus.
Gus had all the answers.
All but one.
- What am I gonna do without Gus?
- Leo, will you stop it?
Ever since you came through that door, it's been Gus, Gus, Gus.
I mean, it's Gus this and Gus that, and I'm fed up with it.
I'm taking you on.
You and all your problems.
- Come on, sit down.
- I don't know.
Sit, Leo.
Sit!
Throw your problems on the bar.
- Come on, give him a chance.
- He's ready for you.
Nothing to be afraid of.
My son comes home from college with his new fiancé, who's black.
I thought about that.
It's a tough one, but I think I've got it.
- Wait a minute cos there's more.
- No, hold it, Leo.
Leo, it's a problem of communication.
Here's what you do, when you get home, you sit the kids down and say to your boy - What's your boy's name?
- Ron.
What's Ron's fiancé's name?
- Rick.
- Rick.
So, you say You say, "Rick, Ron" Rick and Ron?
Suck it up, Coachie.
Hang tough in there.
Leo Leo, if you're that unhappy about it, just throw him out and tell him you never want to see him again.
I can't do that.
I love the kid.
- I see what you're saying.
- You do?
What?
If I can't accept the kid the way he is, I'll lose him.
Boy, that's good.
When you put it that way, what choice do I have?
Thanks, Coach.
You're not Gus, but you're not bad.
Leo, even Gus isn't Gus any more.
- Thanks, Coach.
- Alright, Coach!
Alright, Coach.
You got him.
You really took him.
Took him?
I had him for breakfast.
Coach, where's Sammy?
Out, where else?
Again?
He's been out with a different dolly every night.
He's overcompensating for feelings of inadequacy with an ostentatious display of hormonal activity.
That's our Sammy.
Let me tell you something.
There are drawbacks to dating beautiful women.
Yeah?
Like what?
You can't eat ltalian cos always they're on diets.
You can't go outside cos the wind will muss their hair.
You can't go to hockey games cos they might get hit in the face with a puck.
Where's the fun?
Carla, the fun's in the fun.
Yes.
Unlimited sex.
The adult male's version of owning a candy store.
But tell me, once you've consumed as much sex for as long as you want it, what would you do then?
I'd help the poor.
- I can't stay long.
- One drink.
The man's got a harem.
- You all know Debra.
- Hi, Coach.
Hi, guys.
Diane, this is Debra.
Debra, this is Diane.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Debra.
- What are you drinking?
- A very dry martini.
That's a very classy order.
We're gonna have a very dry martini.
Nothing for me.
We just back from Symphony Hall.
Heard Mozart's Symphony No.
41.
Sometimes called the Jupiter Symphony.
Debra's idea.
I haven't heard a lot of classical music, but I like it.
What was that comment you made in the intermission?
"Give me a cigarette"?
Not that one.
The smart one about the music.
Yeah.
I said, "It's hard to believe that all that music could come out of one man's head".
- "One man's head".
- I heard.
Where else could it come out of?
I read in the programme that Mozart died when he was 35.
Imagine writing all that music before you're 35.
Slow down.
You're giving us too much to think about.
I have got to be going somewhere.
Just as well.
Our heads are spinning.
Wait.
Debra, you forgot your programme.
- Thank you.
- I love Mozart, too.
- This programme's two years old.
- Is it?
Yes.
Well then, Mozart must have been I didn't say we came straight from the concert.
OK, we went to see Star Wars again and I'm glad.
- How did I do?
- Well Thanks.
- Don't.
- Fine.
I'm gonna play pool.
Carla?
You've known Sam a long time.
Has he ever had a relationship with an intelligent woman?
That's the best I've seen.
- What about his ex-wife?
- That was his ex-wife.
I'm gonna go back there and talk to him.
"Blonde Chick Dies in Billiard Accident".
- Sam?
- Go away.
I'm reading Plato.
- May I speak with you for a moment?
- No.
I came in to cheer you up a little.
I know why you brought Debra here.
You're trying to prove you date smart women.
No, I brought Debra here for a drink.
This is a bar.
Come on.
- No, it's a bar.
Is this a bar?
- Yes.
Excuse me.
I sense that you're unhappy right now.
Unhappy?
I'm not unhappy.
I'm on top of the world.
What a life I lead.
Tomorrow, I'm going out with a girl who wears a pinwheel hat.
Would you stop making jokes and talk to me?
OK, I'm all cheered up now.
You can leave.
Thanks.
Why are you so upset?
This week, I have gone out with all the women I know.
All the women I really enjoy.
All of a sudden, all I can think about is how stupid they are.
My life isn't fun any more, and it's because of you.
- Because of me?
- Yeah.
You're a snob.
- A snob?
- Yeah, that's right.
Well, you're a rapidly ageing adolescent.
Well, I would rather be that than a snob.
- And I would rather be a snob.
- Well, good, because you are.
Do yourself a favour.
Go back to your tootsies and your rat parts.
I'd hate to see the bowling alleys close on my account.
Wait a minute.
Are you saying that I'm too dumb to date smart women?
I'm saying that it would be very difficult for you.
A really intelligent woman would see your line of BS a mile away.
You think so?
Well, I've never met an intelligent woman that I'd want to date.
On behalf of the intelligent women around the world, may I just say Well, come on.
Wait.
It depends what kind we're talking about.
- Just the average.
- Any kind.
You take your average whale's intestines and stretch 'em out, you're looking at three miles and change.
You win again, Coach.
This man knows his animal kingdom.
It's getting late.
It's about time this old cowpoke moseyed off to the bathroom.
Black Label over, Bloody Mary, a shot of vodka.
Look, I am sorry.
I said a lot of stupid things.
I shouldn't have.
I apologise.
I was kind of upset.
OK, I'm sorry, too.
We both got a little carried away.
Especially you.
- Well, I'll be darned.
- What?
- Nothing.
I just noticed something.
- What?
I guess I've never looked into your eyes.
Something wrong with them?
No.
I just don't think I've ever seen eyes that colour before.
Matter of fact, I don't think I've ever seen that colour before.
Yes, I have.
Where?
I was on a ski weekend up at Stowe.
I was coming in late one day, last person off the slope as the sun had just gone down.
The sky became this incredible colour.
I usually don't notice things like that, and I found myself walking around in the cold, hoping that it wouldn't change, wishing that I had somebody there to share it with.
Afterwards, I tried to convince myself that I'd imagined that colour, that I hadn't seen it, that nothing on this earth could be that beautiful.
Now I see I was wrong.
Wouldn't work?
What?
An intelligent woman would see right through that.
In a minute.
Damn.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
- What a great day.
Cliff.
- Sammy.
How you doing?
Something funny?
A salesman came by this morning with these new napkins.
Read that one.
It's terrific.
- This isn't funny.
- That's not the funniest.
Read some of the others.
- What others?
- Here.
I bought 30 gross.
Take your pick.
"Did I hear a buck snort"?
No.
They're all different, Sam.
Well, I'll be darned.
That salesman.
But two bucks snorting is funny every time.
You should've asked me first.
Sorry.
I was sure you'd love 'em.
These are real conversation starters.
No, this is not a conversation starter.
- Seen these awful napkins?
- Yeah.
They stink.
See what I mean?
The place is a-buzz.
The Sox need a rally, they have two out in the bottom of the ninth.
The Yanks may have it sewn up, as they lead 5-0.
The pitch.
- Here's your drinks.
Go, Red Sox!
- Miss, which drink is which here?
What does this look like, the Pepsi Challenge?
Carla's getting her drinks mixed up because she's watching that silly game.
Snitch face!
If you'd tried that at St Clete's School for Girls, we'd have given you a pink belly that glowed in the dark.
I'd kinda like to see that.
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm.
- Norman.
- How you doing, Norm?
Cut the small talk and give me a beer.
How come you're late?
The boss kept me after.
I got chewed out a bit.
Yeah?
What for?
I don't know.
Guess he doesn't have a dog.
Alright.
Our prayers are answered.
Normie, babe.
- Yastrzemski's up with a man on.
- The fountain of youth.
C'mon.
- Now we'll get something going!
- C'mon now.
- You and me, Yaz.
My hero.
My man.
- Popped it up!
Sox lose again.
You old fossil!
That's it.
That does it.
May I have your attention?
I have an announcement to make.
As of right now, Carla Tortelli is no longer a Red Sox fan.
No, really, I mean it this time.
Now stop that, OK?
Have I said that before?
Give everybody a drink on me, Sam.
- What's the occasion, Fred?
- My sister, Louise, died.
Congratulations.
Just in the nick of time.
Yeah, I was getting pretty low on funds.
What's going on?
Fred here is the youngest of 12 brothers and sisters - of a very wealthy family.
- I never cared for any of 'em.
Every time one of them dies, Fred here inherits their money.
I think that's ghoulish.
So did we, the first six or seven times.
Remember the night two of 'em drove off the cliff in the fog?
- Talk about a party.
- Yeah.
OK, how we doing here?
Yeah, another one, Sam, but hold the napkin.
What do we have here?
A Red Sox bar?
Sorry about that, fans.
Another tough one in the loss column.
We're closed.
I just came from a classic massacre of Boston by the Yankees.
Tonight on the news, you can watch the lowlights.
You know, I can't see why you people are such bad losers.
You've had so much experience.
- Who do you like, the Yankees?
- Another swift Bostonian.
Yeah, I'm a Yankee fan.
Back in the real city, they call me Big Eddie.
Pig Eddie?
You made good time getting here.
I still hear the TV tubes cooling.
I left right after the Red Sox fans had their seventh-inning wretch.
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, gimme a draught.
You know, Big Ed, the Sox are doing OK.
Yeah?
Since 1918, the Yankees have won 23 world championships.
And the Sox, zip.
Want to talk about major poets from New England as opposed to New York?
Want to talk about Nobel Prize winners in medicine?
No.
Philistines.
- Fred, another round for everybody?
- No, Louise didn't have much money.
But I'll be back.
My 90-year-old brother, Bob, is so wired up, you can get the Super Station on him.
- Alright.
- So long, Freddie!
We'll be thinking of him during the next electrical storm.
- Bye.
- Night, Freddie.
- You homesick for the Bronx?
- Yeah.
Here.
You'll have to forgive Carla, she gets overemotional at times.
But bear in mind, you are in an alien camp.
Tact is perhaps your wisest recourse.
What did you get, a vocabulary for Christmas?
How'd you like to take a flying leap up a knuckle sandwich?
You gather my inference.
C'mon, everybody, take it easy.
We're trying to run a friendly bar.
Everybody sit back, relax.
Read a napkin.
Great shot, kid.
Well, you must admit, the man's a jackal.
I know you.
- What's your name?
- Sam Malone.
- Yeah, that's it.
- Yeah, I usually get it right.
You used to be a relief pitcher for the Boston Red Sox.
- That's right.
- Hey, you didn't stink.
Thanks.
As I recall, you had a darned good hard slider.
And you're schlepping drinks?
The great Sam "Maybe" Malone.
That is "Mayday".
- Let me buy you a drink.
- No, thanks.
I didn't mean all that stuff.
C'mon, have a drink.
- I don't drink.
- A ball player that don't drink?
He doesn't drink any more.
That's what happened.
And I thought you just lost it.
He licked his booze problem three years ago.
What was it like pitching at two guys at the same time?
What was it like coming in with bases loaded, and so were you?
- Easy.
I got her.
- It's OK, everybody, I'm fine.
Sammy, you get a minute, you wanna put a head on this here?
- You alright?
- I'd better get this looked at.
Right.
There's a doctor lives right near here.
No, I was thinking more on the lines of an attorney.
Here's a guy, he's excellent.
Coach.
No, thanks, I got my own, and he's damn good.
You're legally responsible for the actions of your employees.
- You know that?
- It was a stupid mistake.
I'm sorry.
Mistake?
That was an assault in front of witnesses.
I didn't see anything.
I still don't.
Sam, I ain't got nothing against you, you run a clean bar.
Fire her and I'll forget the whole thing.
There must be some other way to settle this.
Yeah?
What d'you suggest?
Well, certainly, an apology's in order.
Carla.
I'm willing to listen.
Listen, Sam, you fire her, or I'm gonna take everything you got.
Well, that's it, happy hour is over.
- What you did was reprehensible.
- You do what you can.
- You talked to your lawyer?
- Yeah, I finally got through.
- What did he say?
- If he's worth a dime, he said by statute and precedence this would be a tort.
And there is substantial grounds for cause of action.
- How did you know that?
- Well, I picked it up in pre-law.
I thought you were an English major?
That was after art and before psychology.
Is there anything you weren't in college?
Blonde.
- Check the yearbook, Carla.
- Don't.
Just stop.
Sam.
Look, I'm sorry I got you in trouble.
I promise it won't happen again.
How am supposed to I believe that?
You've flown off the handle too often.
When?
You don't remember throwing a man's change at him from across the bar?
The correct change.
Carla, look, you have a history of being - abusive with customers.
- I'll handle this.
A history of being abusive with customers.
Sam, he was insulting you.
You don't know when you're being insulted?
I appreciate you defending me, but I'm used to people riding me.
In Yankee Stadium I had to face 50,000 Eddies.
I can defend myself without having to call in Spider Lady.
I did make a couple of nice moves.
Like when I Carla, sit down.
Look.
I'm your friend and I like you.
But I'm also a businessman, and as such I don't like what you did.
Look, I could get tough.
My lawyer wants me to do what Eddie asked.
Fire me?
C'mon.
That's crazy.
Carla, I could lose the bar.
Sam, you can't fire me.
I need this job.
Think of my kids.
If I didn't have this job, I'd have to stay home with them.
Sam, you're not actually thinking about it, are you?
- This is Carla we're talking about.
- I know it's Carla!
Excuse me.
May I make a suggestion?
Sure, honey, go ahead.
What?
Well, I have a close friend who is a clinical psychologist.
- That could work.
- What could work?
Well, I don't know, give the kid a chance to talk.
This friend mentioned to me one time that he has a therapy group for people who, I hope you'll forgive me, for people who can't control their tempers.
- You think I'm wacko.
- Nobody used the word "wacko".
You don't have to be wacko to see a psychologist.
Perfectly normal, happy people consult psychologists.
In fact, get ready to laugh, I have consulted him professionally myself.
Are you one of his better jobs?
I'm trying to help you.
Carla, it might do you a lot of good.
Now you think I'm crazy.
I think you're a person with a lot of anger inside.
Yeah?
Well, stick it!
C'mon, would you?
Look, I grew up on Federal Hill with six older brothers and sisters.
I mean, I worked all my life to get this mean.
Now you're telling me I have to learn nice?
I'm giving you one more chance.
Take it.
OK.
Look, if I go see Whitey's shrink, will you let me stay on?
Show me you're serious, get some help, and I'll keep you on.
Thanks, Sam.
- Come on, let's go home.
- This is great!
Just great.
A minute ago, everything seemed so hopeless.
We were gonna lose Carla forever.
It's all turned around.
I feel wonderful.
All we need worry about now is Eddie taking my bar.
That didn't last long.
I'm sorry, pre-law was after literature and before psycho No, wait.
Indian studies totally slipped my mind.
How could I forget that?
It changed my life.
Fine, Eddie.
Yeah.
See you in 15 minutes.
- So, Ed's coming over?
- Yeah, he's on his way.
When was he last here, Sam?
Three weeks.
Gee, then he's seen the napkins.
Ed?
You mean that swineherd Ed that's suing you?
Yeah, that's the one.
I see what you're doing.
You're taking advantage of Carla's day off to bring Ed in and fool him into thinking you've fired Carla.
It's a crass ploy.
I'm gonna tell him Carla's in therapy and ask him to understand.
My way's better.
That Ed is not my favourite person.
He's a big pansy making a big fuss over some intense pain.
How many times did you play hurt?
- Now and then.
- I must've got hit by 100 fastballs.
- In fact, it was my specialty.
- You specialised in getting hit?
- Yeah.
- He led the league in HBPs twice.
Hit By Pitches.
I perfected it when I was with the St Louis Browns.
I could get to first base on any pitch.
What I'd do was, I'd get up there and lean my body into the pitch.
Sometimes I took one right in the old melon.
But I really made a science out of it.
I became a master.
Here, try to miss me.
Diane, stand there.
Now, I got the batter's box marked off back there at exactly 50 feet, six inches.
You ready?
OK, here we go.
- Has he done this before?
- Lots.
Diane, in those days, we didn't wear batting helmets either.
This is ridiculous.
He'll stay there all night unless you throw.
OK, honey, I'm ready.
Let her rip!
- Come on, baby.
- Alright!
- I won't get it anywhere near him.
- That's the whole point.
I'm on my way to first.
Way to hum, girl.
Right on the old honeydew.
I really had to dive for that one, but I still got the old touch.
Hi, everybody.
Carla.
Hi.
It's Carla.
And Ed's on his way over.
Thanks for reminding me.
Carla.
What the hell are you doing here on your day off?
I brought my shrink to meet you all.
He wanted to put names with faces.
Dr Graham, this is my boss, Sam.
- How do you do?
- Hi.
- And this is Coach Pantusso.
- Hi.
So you're a psychologist?
Our jobs are a lot alike.
Because we both listen to people's problems all day?
Well, there's that, too.
It's really nice to meet you, Doctor.
- Hello, Doctor.
- Hello, Diane.
How are you?
- In what sense?
- Pardon me?
You mean, "How are you"?
, not "How are you"?
- If that's what you meant, I'm fine.
- Good.
It's good to see you, but I should get back to work.
Nothing personal, I'm just a hard worker.
- Not that I'm obsessed with work.
- Diane, get some pretzels.
Hi, Sam.
What's she doing here?
Ed, why don't you sit down way over there?
Listen, I asked you over here to talk about Carla tonight.
She's still working here.
I thought my attorney made my position clear on that.
Well, yes, he did.
Table for one.
Sit down.
See, Carla is seeing a therapist.
She's trying to work things out.
She wants to be the kind of waitress that you'd enjoy being waited on by.
You just ended that sentence with two prepositions.
Don't you have customers to deal with?
That ended with a preposition, too.
Don't you have customers to deal with, mullet-head?
Look So, you're in therapy?
Yes.
I've come a long way, though.
Well, I don't believe it, and I want you outta here.
Ed?
It's a long process.
- Sometimes - Sam?
Ed, gimme a break.
I've been working damn hard and I'm better.
- Yeah?
- Yes.
Boston stinks.
- This bar stinks.
- No, it's alright.
You're a crummy waitress.
- Wait a minute.
- Let it go.
- You're doing wonderfully.
- Hang in there.
You're short.
You're obnoxious.
- You're a terrible dresser!
- That's low.
Sam Malone was a terrible pitcher!
Ted Williams was overrated!
- Bobby Orr was a wimp!
- Eddie, I'd stay away from hockey.
I hit a soft spot, huh?
OK.
The Bruins are a bunch of ugly, stupid sissies!
C'mon, Ed, how much more do you need?
OK, Sam.
I'm gonna drop the whole thing.
Working here is punishment enough.
I wish you hadn't said that about the Bruins.
Why, you a Bruins fan?
No.
I'm a Bruin.
Let me walk you to your car.
I wanna show you some of those sissy things I got suspended for.
Alright!
- Carla, that was wonderful.
- I'm so proud of you.
- A new woman.
- My psychologist Carla, how did you do it?
Nothing to it.
I've been working on this, haven't I, Doc?
We had some great sessions.
I just used this trick Dr Graham taught me.
I imagined a small point way off in the distance - Carla.
Where's that beer?
- Shut up!
We're celebrating!
I just kept thinking of that point.
He never fazed me, I'm telling you.
With a little deep breathing
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Coach, how about a beer?
Sam says I can't serve you.
You're a flimflam.
It ain't for me, it's for a friend.
He asked me to order it for him.
He did.
He wrote it down.
"One beer".
Wait one minute, Harry.
Let me see that.
"One beer".
Just had to make sure.
That'll be one buck.
I thought I had a dollar.
I got a ten.
You got change?
Absolutely.
Here you go.
I have a buck after all.
I don't need change.
Give me my ten back.
Right.
Here you go.
I don't want to carry all these bills.
Give me a 20 for the lot.
You got it.
Nobody move!
Coach, don't you see he's short-changing you?
No.
He's outsmarted me before, but not this time.
How much are you giving him?
- 20 bucks.
- How much is he giving you?
Darn you, Harry!
Sam, I'm just trying to keep in practice.
I'll give you a $30 bill, and we're even.
What do you think?
- No such thing as a $30 bill.
- Wanna bet?
Get out of my bar!
You owe me $10!
Is this a clip joint?
I'm sorry.
Here.
You got the wrong idea about me.
I don't.
You got ten seconds to get out.
Give me back my watch!
I'm trying to help you guys out.
If you wanna upgrade Out!
- Afternoon.
- Hey, Norm!
Gimme a beer, will you?
- How's life treating you?
- Like I just ran over its dog.
You're late.
How come?
Vera dragged me to the mortuary to arrange our funeral.
Thinking of dying, Norm?
No date circled yet, but Vera likes to plan ahead.
We're gonna get cremated.
What'll you do with the ashes?
I wanted to throw them in her mother's face, but I think we'll scatter them on the Adirondacks.
- Hello, everyone!
- Hi, Diane!
Sorry I'm late, but you'll be delighted when you hear why.
We were delighted you were late!
I had a fabulous discussion with my art history professor.
I now feel I have a full grasp of lmpressionism.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Do Kirk Douglas!
Sam, I'm sorry I was late.
Can I do anything to make it up to you?
Yeah but you wouldn't.
Cheers.
Yeah.
Coach, your friend Walt.
Walt?
It's good to hear from you!
I'm so glad the operation's over.
I didn't tell you beforehand, but I didn't think your chances were good.
It's tomorrow?
Don't worry, you'll fly through it.
It's a piece of cake.
Hello, everybody.
The famous sportscaster!
- Hi, Coach!
- Right on, man!
We watch you on the news every night.
Best sports report in town.
What do we have here?
Hi.
Dave Richards, an old team-mate of Sam's.
Diane Chambers.
I'm Sam's new waitress.
Sam have his brand on you yet?
Hardly.
Then it's your lucky day.
I'm incredibly good-looking, incredibly rich and incredibly nice.
And incredibly married!
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- You are?
Yes.
I'd hoped to reject you based solely on your personality.
Too skinny.
Can I have Coach buy you a beer?
- No, I'm here on business.
- I noticed.
How would you like to be my interview on the news tonight?
That's terrific!
Interview me?
I haven't been in baseball for years.
I understand.
You're the best reliever the Red Sox ever had.
You're still a big name in this town.
- We can do it here in the bar.
- You can't ask for more than that.
And besides, you owe me a favour.
- I do?
- Yeah.
That night in Chicago in 1 973, with those two young dollars I borrowed?
Yeah.
Two young dollars?
Yeah, I hate it when they're wrinkled.
I'm out of practice.
It's years since I did an interview.
Come on, Sam.
It's good advertising.
It would help business.
Right.
And we can all be on TV.
I'd like to see myself on TV.
No, you wouldn't.
Trust me.
Trust me on that.
Come on.
I haven't got all day.
Yeah, come on!
Everybody here wants you to do the interview.
Almost everybody.
What do you mean?
Never mind.
Excuse me.
Diane, can I talk to you in the back room?
- Certainly.
- Thank you.
I'll be right back.
I have to discipline an employee.
- Can I watch?
- No!
OK, what's the problem?
Why do you think I have a problem?
You've got that "Sam's a chowderhead and wouldn't understand if I drew him a picture" look.
I do get that sometimes.
Sam, you're an ex-jockstrap Ex-jock.
That's ex-jock!
How many times I gotta tell you that?
What is the origin of the word jock?
I From the French.
Jacques.
Those "Where are they now"?
interviews on TV are depressing.
Any time you put a "former" in front of a name, even the most attractive, bright guy Excuse me.
Attractive?
Yeah.
Even then I didn't know you thought I was attractive.
Well, when the light strikes you in a certain way, and your hair's combed just right, and I'm standing back a ways, you're sometimes somewhat unrepugnant.
Yeah, that's what women call me.
Tall, dark and unrepugnant!
The point I'm labouring to make here is that when I see an old athlete reliving his glory days on TV, I can't help but feel sorry for him.
- I don't want to feel sorry for you.
- Feel sorry for me?
I resent that.
You don't have to feel sorry for me.
You know who you should feel sorry for?
You should feel sorry for the Flintstones!
I beg your pardon?
They're opposite the six o'clock news, and when people find out Mayday Malone is on, Bedrock is gonna be a very lonely little town!
Martina Navra No.
Martina Denavramammajamma No.
Dave, let's do it!
Great.
Give me 20 minutes.
I'll bring the crew right back.
You got it.
It'll give me time to slip into my shawl and blanket!
- Dave, this is a really good idea.
- Yeah, it's pretty good, isn't it?
About time you got around to Mayday.
I'm really excited that he agreed to do the interview.
John McEnroe cancelled out on me.
So Sam was your second choice?
No.
Gerry Cheever's out of town with his horses.
- Third?
- ML Carr has laryngitis.
Fourth?
Jim Rice is out of town, Robert Parish was last week.
And Becky Bannerman, the high school gymnast, is on a field trip.
But Sam was the first retired guy you thought of?
No.
Well I said, Sam was the first retired guy you thought of!
- The very first.
- He's honoured.
The Celtics got going pretty good, eh?
I'm sorry.
I wasn't listening.
I'm practising my floating coin trick.
Pardon me?
Just a little something I do.
So it's a rigged-up coin?
No, it's just a half-dollar.
Look.
It's a trick, right?
Strings, wires and stuff?
No wires, no strings.
I take the coin.
I hold it in the air, about like that.
I let go of it real careful, and it just stays there, it floats.
It hangs there.
What am I, a goof?
There's no way you can do it!
You got five bucks if I can't do it?
Ten!
Ten bucks.
Wait.
Am I being hustled?
You are gonna give me ten bucks if I cannot do it?
You're onsville, pal!
Come on.
- I couldn't do it!
- No, you couldn't!
- What happened?
- I'll tell you.
You just got stuck with ten bucks.
- Coach!
Who is this clown?
- Which clown?
Harry, please!
Harry.
Sam, I'm going.
I was just playing.
But whoever owns a Honda, thanks for the lift!
Did he take you for anything, Norm?
Sorry?
I was practising suspending this coin in mid-air.
Here.
Carla, I'm fine!
He's gonna ask you what's your greatest memory in baseball.
it's gotta be that double header against the Orioles in '72.
He saved both games with seven pitches.
Seven pitches.
Wait a minute.
You wanna talk about excitement?
Sam, tell 'em about opening day in New York.
You come out of the bullpen.
Bobby Mercer's at the plate.
He hit a 400ft home run off me!
It was the most exciting thing I ever saw!
Why would Sam wanna talk about something bad happening to him?
You're right.
Sometimes I think of the smartest thing to say, and then it comes out so stupid.
That doesn't make sense.
You should have heard it before I said it!
- Everybody ready?
- Yeah!
- Well, Mayday, knock 'em dead.
- Thanks.
- You ready, Sammy?
- Yeah.
I am.
Dave, listen.
I'd like to do this, if you don't mind.
Yeah.
We can talk about my greatest thrill in sport, then I wanna talk about my triumph over alcoholism.
Good.
Very good.
It could be very powerful.
Then we could talk about Cheers, what I'm doing now.
And we could talk about what I'd do about the crisis in the Mideast.
Yeah.
The Cubs got that by three and a half games.
Should be a stimulating evening!
Ready.
A little bit more to the left, guys.
- Roll tape.
- Rolling.
Action!
l'm standing here in a popular Boston watering hole called Cheers.
What's wrong with his voice?
Come on, Diane, this is television!
Cut the tape, Ernie.
- Come on, Sam!
- I'm sorry.
- I gotta start over now!
- You'll be alright.
Gee whizz.
- Roll it, Ernie.
- Rolling.
I'm standing in a popular watering hole called Cheers.
Most of you will recognise the guy standing next to me.
Maybe you don't when he's not in his Red Sox uniform.
This is Sam "Mayday" Malone, ex-relief pitcher from the Boston Red Sox, now owner and bartender at Cheers.
- How you doing, Sam?
- I'm alright, Dave, thanks.
That's great.
You've been out of baseball for five years.
Do you miss it?
I miss the fans.
The people of Boston were very good to me.
Yeah.
Tell us about some of the great moments you had here.
I guess I'd have to say one day in Baltimore.
You wanna tell us a little bit about that, Sam?
Well, I was working both ends of a double header.
It's the old story.
First game, bottom of the ninth.
I'm coming in with a man on second and third.
We're holding on to a one-run lead against the Birds.
Boog Powell's coming up.
I could feel the wind from his warm-up swings.
He had the heaviest bat in the League.
Papers were full of him.
I figure the only way to get him is to challenge him on the first pitch.
If I get cute, he'll kill me.
So I decide I'm gonna make him wait on me, make him sweat.
I adjust my cap, go down to the rosin bag, walk around the mound.
When I figure he's getting antsy Dave, John McEnroe called.
Said he's got something to get off his chest.
McEnroe.
Dave, what Sam, thank you.
I'll catch you later.
- What happened?
- I guess he got a better interview.
No.
What happened to the Boog person?
He grounded to third.
- Coach, let's serve some drinks.
- Right, Sam.
Tennis is a sissy game.
- Come on.
We got thirsty people.
- Damn shame, Sammy.
No sweat.
I'm gonna be in back, cleaning up.
- That's our job, Sam.
- It's my bar, Carla!
Carla, will you watch my customers while I'm gone, please?
Sure.
I'll act geeky, give 'em the wrong drinks.
- They'll never know you're gone.
- Thanks.
Sam, this could be a crucial moment in your life.
It's vitally important you handle your emotions properly.
The worst thing anyone in a situation like this could do is to repress his feelings.
Diane, get out, please.
You need to lash out.
To release yourself.
Scream.
- Get out!
- Wonderful!
Alright.
We need now to move away from brute emotions into the more cerebral.
Tell me in one sentence what you perceive to be your problem now.
You won't leave.
Let's come back to that.
Other people have been through what you're feeling.
Even, in a slightly different way, myself.
Would you like me to share an experience from my life when I was defeated and humiliated?
Diane, I don't wanna hear a lead in a high school play story.
It's not a lead in the high school play story.
I don't wanna hear an "I didn't get asked to the junior prom" story.
It's not an "I didn't get asked to the junior prom" story.
I sure don't wanna hear an "I didn't get elected cheerleader" story.
OK, if you're just gonna make a big joke about it I hit it, didn't l?
Sam, I was terrific!
What happened to me today put a period at the end of my career.
The last thing I need is a cheerleader right now.
Well, that's what you need the most!
You know, I was looking at you at that interview today.
I didn't see a washed-up ex-former has-been.
No, I saw a guy who has a great deal to look back on with pride.
And a great deal to look forward to with hope.
Yeah?
It didn't hurt that you were standing next to a Cro-Magnon.
Sam, here's the point.
You have to put the past behind you.
You have to turn and face the future.
You have to open your eyes, see what's in front of you.
You're young, you're alive.
Feel that in your whole body.
Appreciate what you've got.
Live for today.
Go for it, Sam!
I tell you, go for it!
Are you OK?
Yeah I'm fine.
Look.
One of my lights is out!
It's a reflex I learned in a class.
Practical Feminism.
What was your final?
Crippling a Buick?
I'm sorry I had to do that, but I came in with honourable intentions of helping you out.
No, I'm sorry, you're right.
Thank you.
I really appreciate you coming in here.
High point of my day.
How long have you wanted to do that?
Do what?
Kiss me.
How long have you denied that burning desire?
It just came to me.
It was an impulse.
Good, cos if you've been thinking about anything between us, - it's out of the question.
- No, I haven't.
Good.
Listen, Diane.
Thank you.
I will put the past behind me, and tomorrow I'll feel better.
But tonight I'm gonna feel bad.
OK?
Yeah, OK.
Will you do me a favour?
You want me to try and take your purse, right?
OK, I deserved that.
No, I'm curious.
I want to hear about the Booger.
- The what?
- The guy from Baltimore.
Listen, I may not have had 80 majors, but I know when I'm being patronised.
Second game, bottom of the ninth, Boog's up again - Again?
- I'm seeing the clown in my dreams.
See, if I serve him a gopher ball, we're five games out of first place with eight to play.
There's only one guy on base, but it's Don Buford.
He's over there dancing around.
I had to go over there 20 times.
To talk to him about dancing?
No.
You see, you gotta throw the ball to first to keep the runner close to the bag.
If you don't Wait.
Don't you throw the ball at the batter?
Look, this story's going nowhere.
Let's just forget it.
- Good.
Now my cheerleader story.
- OK, Buford's on first - Where?
- Right there.
Put it down.
Easy mistake.
I'll give you another shot.
Gentlemen.
One more time, please.
Let me give you a chance to break even.
I feel just terrible!
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
- Answer that for me, will you?
- You bet, Coach.
Cheers.
Carla?
Yeah.
Carla, it's for you.
- Sounds like trouble with the kids.
- l'm not here.
- Carla.
- Give it to me.
What is it?
Seraphina's where?
Well, cut her down.
No, l don't care if it helps the TV reception.
Cut her down.
And if l get home and you've flushed the car keys again, you've had it.
By the way, any more problems tonight and you're adopted.
Your real mother is Doris Slobotkin, 555 8921 .
Think that's gonna work?
One-in-a-million chance but l gotta take it.
- Hello, everyone.
- Hi, Diane.
Sounds like you had a pretty nice day off.
Well, it was so nice l don't know if l'm ready to talk about it yet.
However, if you insist.
l went out with David from the Anthropology Department.
He took me up to New Hampshire.
We walked in the woods, we communed with nature.
We stayed in a little inn where John Adams slept.
Yeah, lots of guys sign the register that way.
Well, now l know why l didn't wanna talk.
l had a pretty nice day off myself.
Taffy and l went sailing up at Marble Head.
Taffy?
Sailing?
You?
You got a problem with that?
No.
lt's just thought your idea of romance was brunch and a cockfight.
l love sailing.
After seeing Ordinary People, l've tried to get my kids interested.
- Afternoon everybody.
- Ho, Norm.
How's life treating you?
Like he caught in bed with his wife.
- How about a beer?
- Yowza!
l gonna bring some company in.
- Who are you bringing in?
- My new superior.
l gotta butter him up a little bit.
Bring him in here for a drink, catch some dinner upstairs.
- Why not take him to your house?
- My wife lives there.
Gotcha.
One things, you guys, you don't know me in here, OK?
Why?
l don't want him to think l'm a bar fly.
- Good.
- Don't call me Norm.
Gotcha, Norm.
Diane, would you get some singles up at Melville's, please.
Aye, aye, skipper.
Coach, l'll be right back.
l'm gonna get some wine.
- Pardon me.
- Hi.
l'm looking for a Diane Chambers.
You're in luck.
We've got one.
- l beg your pardon?
- l hope you only want one.
Do you sense this conversation is an exercise in futility?
Thank you.
My name is Ernie Pantusso but you can call me Coach.
- Rebecca Prout.
- Hi, Becky.
Diane and l shared a suite at Bennington.
No kidding?
Sam and l shared a Chunky Bar in Cleveland.
- Where is Diane Chambers?
- Upstairs.
She'll be a minute.
Well, l'll just sit at a table and wait.
Okey-dokey.
- Thanks for your help.
- You're welcome.
Any time.
- Rebecca.
- Diane.
What a wonderful coincidence.
l never come into a place like this.
l'm doing research for a paper What the hell's going on here?
A serving girl.
Would you bring us a bottle of wine?
Only if l can spit in it.
lt's all right.
l know that you work here.
- Alright, how did you find out?
- l called your mother.
She took her head out of the oven long enough to fill me in.
God, l've missed you.
l'll never forget those long afternoons in the quad, drinking champagne, eating brioche with strawberry preserves.
Reading and talking Schopenhauer.
Well, enough Schope-talk.
That's the beauty about being a mailman.
l don't have to play smoochy-woochy with my superiors the way you do.
Cliff, believe me, it's worth it for accounting.
l love numbers.
God help me, l love them.
Me, l like the challenges.
Dogs, vicious kids, those hard-to-find mailboxes.
You think accounting's boring?
l miss one digit, a company goes in the toilet.
l'll tell you when it all makes sense.
Mother's Day.
Delivering a card to some old hag.
Watching her eyes mist up, ..
kinda gets me right behind the old ballpoint.
You want to talk sentimental?
Take that same old crone.
Save her a couple of hundred bucks on the short form.
Then l know why the Big Guy put me here.
l actually get paid to stand here and listen to great conversation.
Rebecca, there's something wrong.
You could always see through my façade of gaiety.
Elliot and l have parted.
Rebecca, no.
You and Elliot?
You were together for ever.
l know.
lt all began when Elliot got his doctorate in lchthyology.
His eye began to wander.
The first thing l knew, he'd taken up with a student on a squid expedition.
A doctorate changes a man.
But there'll be others, right?
ln the meantime, you still have your work.
You'd think so.
l used to find enormous comfort translating Russian poetry.
- l know.
- But no more.
Even when l went back over my favourite, Karashnikov's Another Christmas of Agony, it failed to soothe me.
''Mischa the dog lies dead in the bog, The children cry over the carcass, The mist chokes my heart, Covers the mourners, At least this year we eat.
'' lf that didn't pick you up, l'm at a virtual loss.
What l need is to blot out Elliot's memory.
That's exactly what you should do.
l'm looking for a man.
Pardon?
Diane, l've been thinking about this carefully.
l think what l need is something l've never had before.
An evening of unbridled bestial pleasure.
l want to burn at the stake of passion.
Rebecca, you're very vulnerable now.
Please, don't do anything foolish.
l've never done anything foolish in my life and it's high time l did.
The man l'm looking for should be peasant stock.
Tall, dark, strong, hairy arms.
But most important, he should be unintellectual.
One-word sentences.
- Do you know anyone like that?
- No.
Diane, did you get the small bills?
Yeah.
Right.
Excuse me.
Here you go.
l need a ten in silver.
Would you get it for more, please?
OK, Coach.
l'll be right back.
You just sit very still, sip your wine.
Slowly.
Damn.
- Hi there.
- Hi there.
Come here often?
Just about every day.
l work here.
l couldn't help noticing your arms.
Yeah, l get a lot of comments on these.
They go all the way down to my hands.
- What's your name?
- Sam.
Change.
Why?
l like myself this way.
Sam.
Two bourbons straight.
Diane, it's him.
l want him.
Who?
The gay guy with the war wound?
You can't fool me.
He's exactly what l'm looking for.
You're not interested in him, are you?
No, of course not.
Then l'm going for him before l lose my nerve.
Sam, that woman is a dear friend of mine.
She is going through a very difficult period.
So whatever she asks you, please, just say ''no''.
- What?
- ''No.
'' - Diane?
- Yes.
Would you excuse us a moment?
Fine.
Would you object to joining me in my hotel for an afternoon of animal passion?
No.
- What's your name?
- Does it matter?
No.
Diane, Sam's not back yet.
So?
Who cares?
l would if he took off with my friend for two hours.
One hour.
And 53 minutes.
Sam always did like day games.
What do you say?
This looks a nice place.
What are you gonna have, strangers?
Let me get this, Mr Stabell.
l think l'll have a Perrier.
- Give me a beer.
- Wait a minute.
A beer?
That sounds a refreshing change.
l'll have a beer.
Coach.
Listen.
- Hold me to one beer tonight.
- One at a time?
For the whole night.
Here we go.
Two tankards of their finest ale.
Let's talk.
- Hey, Sammy.
- Hey.
- Diane, Sam's here.
- So?
l'm gonna be in my office back here.
Well, hey Nothing going on here, huh?
Dead.
l think l'm gonna stretch my legs, get a little exercise, fresh air.
Gotta take it easy.
l have no respect for a man who can't control himself when it comes to drinking.
Me neither.
How could you do that to that poor woman?
Do what?
Do what.
Thank you, Mr Quickpants.
Rebecca is a very vulnerable person, coming off a shattered relationship.
How could you go off with her?
She said, ''Would you mind?
'' Would you mind.
Those three words are all that separate you from a rutting pig.
That and my aftershave.
How dare you try to be funny when l hate you?
Come on.
What's the big deal?
We're all adults, aren't we?
Yes.
Contrary to your assumption, l am not a prude.
l have a healthy attitude toward ..
you know.
Answer me one question.
Are you proud of what you did today?
l don't kiss and tell.
The pig develops scruples.
Come on.
Look, l'm just kidding you.
Nothing happened.
Alright?
- He compounds it by lying.
- No lie.
l swear, nothing happened.
You mean Rebecca came to her senses?
No.
l stopped it.
l get it.
You got angry because she considered you nothing but a stud service?
No, l like that.
The problem was that l couldn't shut her up.
No offence but your friend is very boring.
She's depressing and she's long-winded.
Those dismal Russian poems.
They don't even rhyme.
After listening to two hours' worth of frostbite and famine, l decided to get my balalaikas out of there.
You turned a woman down?
Yeah.
Here l am all primed for a wonderful afternoon You can't admit the truth, can you?
What?
What is the truth?
Decency finally won out.
You did the right thing.
You were noble.
No.
l was bored.
Unconsciously, you were sensitive to her suffering and you didn't want to take advantage of that.
- Think so?
- Yes.
Sam Malone, you're a better man than you're willing to admit.
Maybe you're right.
Maybe l am kinda turning into a sensitive guy.
Maybe l'll never look at a woman again and see her as a mere sex object.
No, scratch that thought.
lt was my favourite audit.
lt nearly cost my marriage, but it was worth it.
Gotta go for the gusto.
l like your enthusiasm, Norm.
You're a workhorse.
Clydesdale.
You know, l'm having one heck of a time.
l don't usually do this, but let's have another.
- Coach, two more beers.
- Can't do it, Norm.
- No.
lt's OK now.
- Norm, l'm not letting you down.
- You said one beer.
- All right.
- One beer for my friend.
- That's different.
He'll have a pitcher.
Diane, l've come to say goodbye.
For ever.
- Rebecca, what's wrong?
- l'm not attractive to men.
What?
First Elliot and now what's-his-name.
Rebecca, l'm sorry.
Do you have to believe in God to be a nun?
lt helps.
What did Sam do to you?
- Who's Sam?
- The bartender.
Nothing.
That's the problem.
Diane, he found me repulsive.
No, Rebecca.
This must be a misunderstanding.
He climbed out the window.
l'm going back there to talk to Sam.
He must know that he's hurt you.
l originally wanted to be a dancer.
You're a pig.
l haven't moved.
How did l get back to pig?
- You have ruined a human being.
- Who?
Rebecca.
- She's sitting out there right now.
- Mother Russia?
l'm not here.
Sam, she's crushed.
l have never seen this woman so depressed.
Believe me, l have seen her depressed.
- l believe you.
- Well, you have to do something.
She is seriously upset.
lt's your fault for the way you rejected her.
- Wait, where are you going?
- l am going to bring her in.
No.
Come on, give me a minute to build a window, or something.
You're going to restore her confidence.
What am l gonna say?
Just tell her the reason you rejected her wasn't because you found her unattractive.
What was the reason?
l don't know.
Tell her that you belong to someone else.
That you lost your head for a moment, that you're an uncaring worm.
l was laughed at by the other boys, Norm.
Rebecca, may l speak to you in here for a moment?
But don't they always laugh at the graceful fellows?
Hello, Rebecca.
Hello Again.
When l left the hotel, l may have given you the wrong impression.
You see, l thought there was a fire.
l'm sorry.
Rebecca, l might not have been totally fair with you.
The reason l left was, l'm kinda seeing another person.
l was afraid this was going to happen.
You're making excuses to spare my feelings.
No.
This is true.
l really am seeing somebody else.
- Please.
- Rebecca.
You are a very desirable woman.
He does happen to be going with somebody, that's all.
- Me.
- You?
We can tell it now.
Yes.
Today we had a tiff right before you came in.
And Sam used you to make me jealous and then when push came to shove, he finally remembered what a wonderful thing we have together.
lsn't that right, sweetheart?
Yeah.
Sure.
You bet ya.
Yes, Sam and l are deeply and passionately in love.
l can't believe it.
You two?
lt's incredible.
l'd never have put you two together.
Well, l know.
lt does test the limits of human logic.
But, like you, l was growing bored with bright, articulate men.
- You were?
- Sure.
l was looking for meat and potatoes.
Sam here, the old side of beef, really fit the bill.
You know, l was getting kinda bored with beautiful, sexy, sensuous women.
l decided to go for pleasant.
Believe it or not, l actually prefer a man who's thick and ordinary.
l guess l'm kind of old-fashioned.
l like a woman who does what her man tells her.
Lookee there, my shoe's undone.
Will you get that for me, honey?
What, darling?
Would you tie my shoesy-woosy for me?
She loves doing these little things for me.
That's a little tight there, honey.
- How's that, sweetheart?
- That's much better.
Thank you.
Well, all of a sudden, l feel like l'm intruding.
l can see that there's such emotion in this room.
Thank you for everything, Diane.
Rebecca, thank you.
lt was wonderful to see you again.
- l'll write you.
- Oh, good.
Things'll work out.
Let go of me.
- You had the gall.
- Just get That's the kind of passion l was hoping l'd find.
You'll find it, Rebecca.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Diane.
Do me a favour.
Pour Mischa there a real quick beer.
Coming right up, Mischa.
There you go.
Sam, what is he doing with his hand?
He plays cymbals for the Symphony.
They're in the middle of a concert.
He's counting out a long rest so he knows exactly when to get back.
Fascinating.
OK, that's 1 .
25 out of a 20.
1 .
50, 1 .
75, two, three, four, five, ten and 20.
Musicians are very temperamental.
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!
Norman.
- How's life, Norm?
- Not for the squeamish, Coach.
You're shaking like a meringue in an earthquake.
My whole career as an accountant, l sat in my cubicle, kept my mouth shut.
- Today l volunteered for something.
- What?
Every year, the firm has a company party.
- Yeah?
- Guess who's party director.
Let me guess.
l'm good at guessing.
Julius LaRosa?
Warm, Coach.
Me.
Gee, l should've taken more time.
Probably.
- How come you volunteered?
- To make points with the big boss.
Last year, some nobody named Jensen threw a luau in the parking lot.
lt was a big hit.
You know where that man is today?
Leaning over my shoulder saying, ''Add faster.
'' What are you so upset about?
lt sounds like a great opportunity.
That's what l thought.
But after l volunteered, l realised l never threw a party.
l killed a few.
What's the big deal?
You want excitement, pay a sexy chick to jump out of a cake.
lf you want to save money, get Carla to do it.
Carla.
Strippers aren't enough here.
Will you relax?
Life's too short.
You don't understand.
We're talking about 1 00 accountants.
Their lives are incredibly dull all week long.
l gotta do something special to turn them on, wake 'em up.
The best party l was ever at was in a locker room.
We were all in our underwear, pouring champagne on each other.
Guys flinging guys into showers.
lt was terrific.
That was after we'd won the division championship.
- That's why we were in Cleveland.
- Right.
Norm, l've got a great idea.
Have yourself a hot-tub party.
- What?
- The latest craze in California.
You know, Weirdo Central.
Get a bunch of people in a hot tub, who knows what'll happen?
Today l delivered two copies of Star Parade magazine.
- Guess who's on the cover in a tub?
- Julius LaRosa?
No, Burt Reynolds.
l used to be so good at this game.
l did think of one icebreaker.
l go through this year's audits, find the biggest mistakes, Xerox them and pass them around.
We're talking monster laughs.
You're a maniac, Normie.
Perhaps l can give you an idea that you could actually use.
l think parties are the most fun when you can shed your everyday mundane identity and be someone else.
ln college, l held a party where everyone came as their favourite Elizabethan poet.
l remember.
lt was so great, l chose Christopher Marlowe.
l was deeply into Dr Faustus at the time.
But l still get letters from people who loved it.
Say, didn't we used to have a weekly Elizabethan Poet Night?
Yeah, started getting too rowdy.
You were charged with practising iambic pentameter without a licence.
Sam, if l'm to serve both as a waitress and the butt of jokes, l should make more money.
What does a good butt make in this town?
ln keeping with the spirit of this establishment, and its patrons, l suggest you get down in the mud and throw a toga party.
A toga party?
Where they dress up in sheets?
l'm sure you'd love it.
lt's a stupid fraternity tradition.
A bunch of borderline humans stand around swilling beer and vomiting on themselves, until, inevitably, they raise their robes to reveal the depths of their personalities.
Hallelujah, l am saved!
l can see it.
This'll make that luau look like a pig roast.
Easily.
Can l use Cheers?
l'll pay half what you ask.
- How can l pass that up?
- l got a lot to do here.
l should go home, close myself off and work out all the details.
- Good luck.
- l can do it in the bathroom.
Sam.
- Are these people dressed in togas?
- No, Coach.
l thought it mean to be a toga party.
lt is.
l'm getting my spells again.
l though l had 'em licked.
- No, you are right, Coach.
- Sure?
Yes.
These people just haven't got into the spirit of the party.
Oh, thanks.
Diane.
The gang in the back ready for another order?
Not yet.
lt's been an hour and a half.
Are they watching their ice melt?
Actually, it's quite peppy.
One fellow, believe or not, can recite every area code in the country.
We're talking dazzling entertainment.
Sam, can you spring me for a few minutes?
l gotta see this.
Enjoy, Coach.
lf this guy knows Laramie, Wyoming, l'll croak.
Boy, this party stinks.
Well, maybe we should do something to help pick it up.
l got an idea.
Why don't you go back to my office?
ln my desk you'll find two tassels and a G-string.
l'll hum Night Train - Come on.
- Get out.
Let the games begin!
Holy Well, you all got the date right so l know you can read.
How come you're not in a toga?
l was afraid everyone else would chicken out and l'd look like a fool.
Good point.
Jensen, nice suit.
Hello, there.
Why did l volunteer?
l'm a dead man.
Sammy, you got someone lying in state in the back room?
Nobody's moved for an hour and a half.
Normie, l like it.
You look like the Pillsbury Dough Monster.
- How come you're late?
- l had car trouble.
You try flagging down help dressed like this.
Where's your wife?
Why isn't she at the party?
She didn't hear about it.
This is the worst party yet.
Thanks loads for the toga idea, Diane.
Well, Norman, all you need is a little icebreaker.
Let me help.
Everybody.
How about a round of that always enjoyable game, charades?
l'll start off.
Movie title.
Four words.
First word.
My.
Sounds like eye.
l'll give you the first one, get you going.
OK, second word.
What am l doing here?
Eating.
Doesn't this look like eating?
When do we eat and drink?
Dinner!
My Dinner Third word.
What is this?
lt's little, isn't it?
lt's a little word.
W. Begins with a W. Little word.
With!
My Dinner With My Dinner With Julius LaRosa!
That's it.
- OK, Ogden, Utah.
- Eight zero one!
Hold it down, everybody, it's the phone!
l feel it!
l feel that beat!
Get up off your seat and on your feet.
lt's limbo time.
Come on, everybody!
Come on now.
Last year, you ate a pig with your fists.
What's going on?
Come on!
Pack of nerds.
Norm, that was a message for you.
Somebody named Ruta can't make it tonight.
Ruta's the girl l had coming to entertain the big boss.
This can't be happening.
First, l throw the worst party in history, now l got no date for the big boss.
You've got to set your boss up with a woman?
Yeah, it's the party director's duty.
Why not ask one of the women here?
Or does your boss like live things?
- Carla, do you suppose?
- No, Norm.
Don't look at me.
l got four kids.
l'm not looking for more.
- You needn't have sex with him.
- Doesn't matter.
l'm a fast breeder.
A man winks at me and l'm three months along.
l need a woman!
Does anybody need anything?
Hallelujah!
Let me see if l've got this straight?
You want me to entertain a man l've never met.
Pour him a few drinks and chat with him.
You don't have to go home with him.
Though if you do, l'll drive.
l'm joking around.
l'm going to walk away and pretend that you never asked me to do this.
This could work out for you, too.
You might like this guy.
He's intelligent.
He went to Harvard Business School.
Sam?
l can't believe your job depends on you finding this guy a woman.
That's right.
lt's demeaning and dehumanising, not just to me but to yourself.
l get it.
You think l'm a kissy, right?
lt's easy for you two to talk.
Diane's attractive, she's got brains.
Sammy, good-looking, a baseball star.
l've got nothing.
My only hope is to find someone with something and make them like me.
- Norm - So if there are boots to be licked, apples to be polished and fannies to be kissed, l'll be there.
First time l saw a man strut and grovel at the same time.
You know, Norm is kind of in a jam here tonight.
- Now you want me to do this.
- lt wouldn't be so bad, would it?
- You're asking me to do this.
- What's the big deal?
You sit down with some old guy, you have a drink, he'll fall asleep.
Hello, Mr Sawyer, sir.
Welcome.
Well, Norman's a friend.
l guess l could give the old geezer a couple of minutes of my time.
We are all honoured and thrilled that you could make it.
- l like your sheet.
- This old thing?
Come on down here, l'll show you a seat.
Why don't you let me do that?
l know the place.
l'll never forget this, Diane.
Mr Sawyer, Diane Chambers.
- Nice to meet you, Diane.
- Nice to meet you.
Why don't you two sit right here?
You!
Well, what would you like to drink?
Scotch rocks.
Barkeep, a little service, please.
Mr Sawyer will have Scotch rocks.
Let's see, what am l in the mood for?
How about a good beating?
- Perhaps a vermouth cassis.
- Fine.
lf you need anything else, just snap your fingers.
ln several places.
l guess working in a bar makes you grumpy.
Good evening!
We're Eddie Barnett and the Eddie Barnetters.
OK, it's request time.
Shout 'em out.
Chicago?
One of Eddie's favourites.
Chicago.
Norm, this band is the worst.
l don't understand it.
They sounded so good over the phone.
- So you're an art student?
- Yes.
l always wanted to be a painter.
l must say, it is so refreshing to meet someone like you.
Someone in business who enjoys the finer things.
Here you go.
One for you.
One for your lady of the evening.
- To a sparkling conversationalist.
- Thank you.
l'd normally ask you to go out and find some place to talk, but l don't think we'd find any place as quiet as this.
- Something wrong with your drink?
- Yes.
- l'll take it back.
- No, l know the bartender.
- You sure?
- Yes, l'll be right back.
- Do you have a problem, Mr Malone?
- Listen, you're a light drinker.
Don't get carried away and do something you'll regret.
You're not bothered that l'm spending time with Herb?
Herb?
No.
None of my business, really.
Looks a little seamy but seaminess has its place.
A moment ago you were encouraging it.
A moment ago, he was 85 years old.
l see.
An old man is fine, but one whose kidneys are functioning is taboo.
Look, like l said, it's none of my business, but he expects you to be his for the whole evening.
Know what l mean?
Sam, we are having a harmless conversation about art.
- You know what l think?
- What?
l think you're bothered that he's so good-looking.
You call that good-looking?
He's got padded shoulders and l bet that's not even his real lips.
- He's gorgeous.
lt drives you crazy.
- No.
lt kills you that there's another attractive man in your bar.
Another rooster in your henhouse.
My days are much easier now we've got those Cup-a-Soups in the office.
lf that was your idea, Mr Sawyer, you are a genius.
Norm, how about l buy you a drink?
Why don't you set sail for the bar and have yourself a good time?
That's wonderful, sir.
l understand there's a pool table in the back.
How about a game?
OK.
l've never played before, but why should that stop us?
Thank you for that conversation, sir.
l'm the better for it.
- Hi, there.
- Hello.
That is a good-looking guy.
l felt something kick.
Now you know why l never go to these things.
lt's strange, getting that reaction from people.
l like to think it's the money and position, not me.
l can assure you, it's not you.
l think Sawyer likes Diane.
l'm on my way, big guy.
You're really sickening tonight.
l know, Sam.
l'm not proud of myself.
But then, l never am.
Well, Simon Says is my game.
l'm great at that.
Maybe l can help you out.
l can teach you to play in a couple of minutes.
Just put your left hand down, like that.
- Grab the end with your other hand.
- l'm not in the way, am l?
- You smell wonderful.
What is it?
- Thank you.
Dandruff shampoo.
- l like it.
- l don't flake for hours.
- Herb, wait a minute.
- Diane, you're beautiful.
You know, l don't believe in mauling on the first date.
- l didn't come to hear the band.
- We were having a nice conversation.
- That part's over.
- How is everything back here?
- Norman!
- He'll stop in a minute.
- No, really.
- Mr Sawyer, sir - Get lost, Norm.
- Fine, sir.
- This is not my idea of romance.
- Come on.
- Wait.
- l told you to leave.
Mr Sawyer!
- This is a big mistake.
- Sorry, sir.
l know, sir.
Nice cologne, sir.
You're crazy.
You set me up with this girl and then do this?
There's no room in my company for unstable people.
- Clean out your desk.
You're fired!
- l figured.
Norman, l'm real sorry you lost your job.
- That's what l was trying to avoid.
- lt's alright.
What was that about?
Your boss just stormed out.
- He's not my boss any more.
- What?
He was all over Diane.
l had to get rough with him.
l want a beer.
- You OK?
- Yes.
Well, go ahead.
Gloat.
Believe it or not, l'm really sorry this happened.
l know you must be feeling hurt and angry right now.
No.
l'm not feeling hurt and angry.
l brought this on myself.
- Actually, l feel kind of - Cheap?
Alright, yes, l feel cheap.
l saw an attractive person, a little glamour, and l wanted to meet him so badly that l threw myself at him.
Totally sacrificing my dignity and pride.
What's wrong with that?
l do that all the time.
For one terrible moment l saw myself through his eyes.
l saw nothing but a cheap harlot.
Come on.
We all know that you'd starve to death before you made a living with your body.
- Thanks, Sam.
- You're welcome, Diane.
So he fired you, Norm?
Fired me, Coach.
You know something?
l may not have a job.
l may not have a future.
l may not have anything except this sheet on my back.
But you know something?
l feel terrible.
Gee, l'm sorry, Norm.
- Did you really hit the boss?
- No, l just shoved him around a bit.
Everybody, it's true.
Norman just punched out the boss.
- l just pushed him around.
- Way to go, Peterson.
Alright, Norman!
Norman, our hero!
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Alright, locking it up.
Who needs a ride home?
Come on, who needs a ride home?
l guess we're all sober enough to drive ourselves tonight.
Looks like you get to go straight home for a change.
l've never driven straight home.
l wouldn't know how to do it.
- OK, Coach.
You can take me.
- What a prince.
- Thanks, l owe you one.
- Any time.
Goodnight now.
Drop me off at Kenmore Square.
l can catch a cab to take me back here to my car.
What do you think you're doing?
Just having a little late-night fun.
Listen, pencil neck, you're starting to get on my nerves.
Please don't call me pencil neck.
l am not a pencil neck.
l'm sorry.
l didn't mean to call you pencil neck, gozzlehead.
Name calling.
The last refuge of the monosyllabic.
l don't know what that means but l heard slob in there.
Hey, come on, Diane, Carla, you go at each other every night.
We're getting scouts in here from the roller derby.
Listen, l mean it.
Do something about this, or l'm gonna l'm gonna think about personnel changes.
What choice do we have, Sam?
We don't like each other.
No, Carla, Sam's Carla.
Sam's making good sense.
You could knock me over with a feather, but he is.
We need to sit down together and talk this out.
That's nuts.
What's there to talk about?
Listen.
l want you to sit down and settle this, or else.
We'll do it.
Carla Do it.
- Can we use this table?
- Oh, you mean here?
No.
l was thinking more along the lines of your homes or a coffee shop.
Down by the docks, maybe.
Sam.
We'll lock up, don't worry about it.
Now is the time.
This is the place.
Unchecked rage is like a festering wound.
Laughs aplenty tonight.
Look.
You expect me to l leave the two of you here without a referee?
Come on.
What could happen?
Nothing.
Two women left alone, who hate each other, in a room filled with glass and alcohol.
Silly.
- This was your idea.
Bye.
- Alright.
Check the locks twice, OK?
Aye, aye, captain.
And make sure the lights over the bar are out.
Lights over the bar.
Right.
Goodnight.
Maybe check the thermostat.
We'll do that, yes.
Thank you, goodnight and goodbye.
l have no life insurance.
Just this place.
Goodnight.
OK, let's sit down, relax and open the lines of communication.
l want a drink.
Wonderful.
Let's have a bottle of wine.
l think we've got your favourite.
Château Guam.
l'm talking a drink.
l'll make it.
Wonderful.
OK.
You're gonna like this.
And then we use l only do it for special occasions.
Well, Carla, thank you.
l'm honoured.
You're really getting into the spirit of this thing.
- What's the drink?
- A family recipe.
We call it Leap lnto An Open Grave.
You're kidding.
My Uncle Joe stumbled across it when he was making a car bomb.
You're kidding, right?
Carla?
One for good luck.
Nice touch.
Keep the glasses moving so the fumes don't burn a hole in the ceiling.
Delicious.
And it goes right to your head.
No one in my family lives past 43.
OK, let's chat.
l don't know what we're talking for.
We're different people.
We'll never get along.
- We're not totally different.
- Name one similarity.
Well, we We're both women.
Why do l get the feeling that we're jerking our chain, here?
No, there's more.
We both share the same job.
Of course, l'm not as good at it as you are.
lt doesn't take a genius to notice.
But thank you.
You know, Carla, l particularly admire the way you handle passes.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
A guy in the back room tonight asked me if l wanted to play something called The Shepherdess And The Hun.
Which part did he want you to play?
This is fun, isn't it?
Easy give-and-take between two working gals.
You know, l think we're coming together.
That's the Open Grave.
Give it another 1 5 minutes, you'll be French-kissing the sump pump.
No, seriously.
We're connecting, l'm certain of it.
Yeah.
People need people.
l'm a people person.
l can be there for you, l wanna be there for you.
Please, benefit from my depth.
This stuff.
Great.
You would do that for me?
You'd listen to me?
With all my heart, mind and soul.
You know, Thank you.
There are moments when l wanna spill my guts, know what l mean?
Yes.
l've got things, one thing in particular, that l've been carrying around inside of me for a long time.
Tell me.
l barely know you.
Well, Carla, you brought it up.
You obviously want to get it out.
Maybe l do, but Carla, l swear, l'll keep my mouth shut.
l swear.
About five years ago ..
Sam threw a party here.
The big guy was still on the sauce so every night was an excuse for a big bash.
Anyway, this one time he was too tanked to drive home.
So l took him.
l helped him upstairs.
..
to his bedroom.
One thing led to another.
Nine months later, Gino was born.
- Gino?
- Sam's son.
Carla, l don't believe this.
Me neither, you're gonna die.
Sam.
Sam did this?
He's a beast.
No.
Sam's been really good about it.
l mean, he's always helped out with the kid.
l've never blamed him for anything.
lt's as much my fault as his.
But you bore the child, you're raising the child.
You plucky little soldier, you.
Sam and l are the only ones that know, understand?
Carla, l l just wanna hug you right now.
l feel kinda close to you, too.
People People who need people Good God.
Carla, my gumba.
l like somebody who knows when she's had enough.
Hi.
Sorry l'm back, l forgot my bubblegum.
l know that sounds crazy Oh, my God, Carla, you killed her.
Don't get your hopes up, Sam.
l just mixed her a drink.
Carla, you made her an Open Grave.
Yeah.
And she leaped right in.
She's out cold.
This is irresponsible.
- l tried to slow her down.
- l'm gonna take her home.
- Will you get her things for me?
- Sure.
Did you straighten things out?
Yeah.
You know, it was great.
She got sickening, l told the biggest lie l could think of and she started to sing.
- Why did you do that?
- She brings out the devil in me.
l dunno.
l was getting a buzz on feeling loose.
l decided to have some fun with her.
What did you tell her?
Sam, it's something l told Diane.
She swore she would never tell another living soul.
She'll tell you tomorrow.
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm.
- How's it going?
- Daddy's rich, Mamma's good-lookin'!
Good evening.
Hi, Diane.
How are you?
Hey, Sis, how's my buddy feeling today?
Well, ..
l got up this morning, washed my face.
l shaved my tongue.
l came right in.
However, no regrets.
Evenings like that come seldom in a lifetime.
- How are you, Carla?
- Fine, thanks.
How is poor little Gino?
A little hung over, are we?
l can't keep anything from you.
You know, l know something to stop hangovers.
Thank God.
What is it?
Don't drink so much.
Thank you.
But thank you, Sam.
Truly.
For getting Carla and l together at last.
You're welcome.
She really is a wonderful woman, isn't she?
Yeah.
She's alright.
And her children are truly wonderful, too.
Yeah, if you like chainsaws with feet.
But l understand that Gino is an extraordinarily fine young man.
Which one's he?
He's who he is.
- Sam, where's my bourbon and ginger?
- Coming right up.
You're slipping, sweetheart.
- You're staring at me.
- Oh, was l?
Right through me, in fact.
l've got to get home to the little lady.
- lt's my tenth wedding anniversary.
- Congratulations.
- Big plans, huh?
- The biggest.
We're going out for a pizza.
lt gets me back here about ten o'clock.
A whole quarter.
l'm gonna name the Ferrari after you.
- Now look here, miss - No, you look - My office now.
- lt's a whole dollar below insult.
- Carla, right now.
- Sam.
lt wasn't her fault.
She was deliberately snubbed.
Diane, she's my employee.
This is none of your business.
Stay out of it.
Coach, Sam just called Carla ''an employee''.
No kidding.
How did Carla take it?
- What do you think he's gonna do?
- Nothing.
Bawl her out a little.
How dare he chastise her?
She can barely scrape out a living.
How much suffering does she have to do?
She's raising four children, not to mention one of them is Sam's One of Carla's kids is Sam's kid?
- No.
l didn't say that.
- Let me figure this out, now.
Sam knows Carla five years, right?
Carla's youngest kid, Gino, is seven and a half.
That's it.
lt works out.
Wait a minute.
- Gino is seven and a half years old?
- Yeah.
And Sam and Carla have only known each other five years?
Right, but who would ever figure that Gino was Sam's kid?
She lied.
She deliberately lied.
You mean that Gino's not Sam's kid?
No.
Holy mackerel!
This is gonna break Sam's heart when he hears this.
l reached out to her.
That weasel.
Coach, what do you do when you are so furious you have to do something?
Well, l know you'll think it's crazy, but l bang my head on the bar.
Doesn't sound crazy to me.
lt might do me good right now.
Well, OK.
- No, don't.
Stop that, please.
- You feel better?
Yes.
Thank you.
- How about you?
- l feel fine.
To me, it's kind of a picker-upper.
Hello.
My name is Carla.
l'll be your slave for the evening.
No, l won't do it.
l won't give her the satisfaction.
She's just waiting for me to break her confidence.
She can play me for the fool, but she will not tarnish my dignity.
This is none of your concern.
Hello, my friend, my dearest confidante.
How's your rotten, lying little mouth?
Got you.
''One thing led to another, and then Gino was born.
'' l knew it.
l knew you'd tell.
You had to tell somebody our secret to find out.
- That's beside the point.
- lt isn't.
l knew you couldn't keep it.
You hold your secrets like your booze.
Telling me that story was reprehensible.
Lighten up.
You wanna be my friend?
You wanna get along?
Let your hair down.
How about l take your hair and scour the sink with it?
ls that a Brillo shot?
Only if it offends you.
You sound like a lady who is getting tired of her teeth.
l'm tired of your teeth and all the vermicelli in between.
ln my office.
Be quiet!
l think Sammy can handle that one, huh, Coach?
l hate to see that kind of thing between women.
l know what you mean, Coach.
Women fighting is very unladylike.
Unless, of course, they're wallowing around in mudpits.
Now, somebody, please, tell me what's going on.
Last night, out of the goodness of my heart, l reached out to this little twerp.
And she deliberately duped me into believing that you were the father of one of her children.
- Me?
- Yes.
She referred to it as a joke.
Snicker, snicker.
l told her we fooled around once and Gino was the result.
Gino?
You told her that you and?
You thought that she and l?
Gino?
Your Gino?
You should have seen her face.
Her chin was in her lap.
Of course, laugh at the fool.
Laugh at my expense.
- Show her a picture of Gino.
- Yeah, OK.
You think he's funny-looking.
You wanna see what makes Gino laugh?
- His real dad.
- Let me see.
Look, Whitey, l'm sorry.
l know l can be a real pain sometimes.
And l know that l take things a little too seriously at times.
l guess l need to be reminded of that.
Well, l'll always be there for you.
Listen, l want you two to shake hands.
You're alright.
Maybe we can go to a movie one night.
Fine.
When?
l'll get back to you.
l'm proud of you, l really am, for holding your own with Carla.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Sam, could l ask a little off-the-cuff question?
Sure.
Who took me home last night?
You or Carla?
You don't remember?
No.
We both did.
Who put my pyjamas on?
- Carla did.
- You'd already left by that time?
No.
l was still there.
You mean watching?
No.
l was in the other room, minding my own business.
On my good behaviour.
Trying on your lingerie.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Everybody, step right in here.
Come on.
This is the home of Paul Revere.
- Looks like a bar to me.
- The Reveres liked to entertain.
Walk around and soak up some atmosphere.
Give me a shot of bourbon.
What's this all about?
lt's a walking tour of Boston.
lt's 30 degrees outside and my feet are throbbing.
Paul Revere's house is nowhere near here.
You wanna do this?
l gotta fit in five more sites before six o'clock.
l'll never make it.
We are also standing on the Grainery burying ground, the Olde Corner Bookstore and the Old North Church.
Let's get going, this is it for Boston.
- That's the whole tour?
- Seemed to fly by, didn't it?
Bid a fond adieu to Boston, the hub of New England.
l always thought Boston was a lot bigger.
lt is in the summer.
Sure, sister, that'll be fine.
You're welcome.
l didn't know you had a sister.
That's Sister Theresa from St Matthias School for Girls.
She's sending a student over with a playbill.
St Matthias is a good school.
l've had two kids thrown out of there.
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!
- What's up, Norm?
- My nipples.
lt's freezing.
So, how was your Sunday?
Catch the Celtics-75ers game?
Yes, and the Bruins-Flyers, the Ramos-Ramos fight.
Australian rules football.
Tomorrow, Boston College play lona.
Put that money down, pal.
Doesn't your wife ever complain you never spend time with her?
Would you?
What l can't fathom is how one can drink cold beer in freezing weather.
- Cliff?
Explanation.
- How do you know he has one?
Five bucks says he does, ten says it's a doozy.
- When the British ruled Punjab - Ten bucks all the way.
..
they drank steaming hot tea on the hottest days of the year to balance the inside and outside temperatures.
Conversely, drinking an ice-cold drink on a cold day results in a more comfortable body temperature.
Alright.
Why do you drink ice-cold beer on a hot day?
Mr Clavin?
What else are you gonna do with it?
l gotta get rid of a little now.
l'll be in the little boys' room.
Hop on one leg, big boy.
The pipes are clogged up again.
Nothing's working back there.
Sorry.
Go up to Melville's again.
- Jacket in the same spot?
- Yeah.
What a drag, having to dress up to go to the john.
Come on.
You men have it easy.
We have to wear taffeta and have the correct change.
Hey, that looks good.
Who's your tailor?
Give me a break.
The sweater's a little bulky.
Have a good time up there, Ollie.
- l'm in the back with my pipes.
- Wait.
- l've got an order.
- Carla's got the bar.
That's right!
OK, everybody!
Carla's got the bar.
You can have anything you want, as long as it has no ice, straws, cherries, olives, mixer, umbrellas, fruits or flames.
An order.
l need an old-fashioned, a brandy Alexander and a martini.
Three beers coming up.
The damnedest thing.
l've been shivering all the way over here.
Coach, you have no coat on, it's 30 degrees outside.
Thank God, l thought l had malaria.
Are you alright?
l don't know where my mind is today.
l just remembered, l left it at Nina's apartment.
- Your mind?
- No, my coat.
Who's Nina?
A girl who moved into my building today.
l helped her move some stuff.
lt's the damnedest thing.
l kept wanting to smell her neck.
To smell her neck?
- lt hit me what that's all about.
- Physical attraction?
No, Lux.
lt used to be the soap of the stars.
Don't say anything about this to anybody, please.
- Why?
- lt's embarrassing.
lf you're my friend, you won't say anything, OK?
Coach, you're a normal, healthy man who's attracted to a woman.
What's wrong there?
She's a lot younger than me.
How much younger?
You'll see, l told her where l work.
She might drop in after she unpacks.
Hello.
Hi, sweetheart.
You're under arrest.
Are you crazy?
That's not her.
- Come on in.
- l'm from St Matthias School.
Sam said l could put a playbill up.
- Good.
- What play are you doing?
lt's a production of Twelve Angry Men, a taut, absorbing psychological drama.
When l was your age, we did Romeo and Juliet.
We were looking for something with more meat.
Thank you.
You're welcome, honey.
l'll hang it up for you.
- Hi, Ernie.
- Nina, hi.
Welcome to Cheers.
Boy, it's nice and warm in here.
My apartment is freezing.
l hope it's OK, the super's gonna call me here when the heat's on.
lt's a great idea.
Sit down, l'll show you the place.
Have a seat.
Now, let's see.
This is the bar.
Those are the bottles.
These are the glasses.
That's a stool.
Any questions?
l've always wondered what gas you use to pressurise those beer kegs.
Probably unleaded.
- Can l get you a drink?
- White wine.
White wine.
Diane, Nina.
Nina, Diane.
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.
Diane is very smart.
Say something very smart.
Tempus fugit.
- Coach, she's adorable.
- lsn't she?
Carla, come over a minute, will you?
l'm busy.
Carla's been in a lousy mood for the last two, three years.
lt's getting strange up there.
That's Norm.
That's not Norm's jacket.
- How do you mean, strange?
- That new men's room attendant.
The guy hands me a towel, whisks me off and invites me out to a movie.
Guys, meet Nina.
She just moved into my place.
No, not my apartment, my building.
Crazy guys, but nice.
l'd still be dragging my box spring without Ernie.
You're a dog, Coach.
Honey, excuse me.
l gotta check the backroom.
- That's it for me.
- That's Sam.
He's handsome.
He's a bit of a wolf.
l don't know what to do.
Anyone know anything about plumbing?
Well, the Romans had an elaborate system of aqueducts.
They were sort of the forerunners of Cliff.
l need somebody to help me fix the plumbing.
Sorry, Sammy.
Strictly theory.
- Let me do it.
- Give me a break.
Come on.
l'm an expert at this stuff.
l've got four kids and one bathroom.
My kids gave me Drano for Mother's Day.
Give me that wrench.
l'm going in there.
Go get them.
Everybody out of the men's room.
Why didn't you say that before you came in?
- Give me two beers.
- Excuse me.
Sam!
l know what you're going to do.
l can't explain now.
Just stay away from that woman.
What woman?
Actually, l was going for a coffee.
Thanks for pointing her out.
l must be slipping.
Please, l can't tell you why, but it's just not right.
OK.
Alright.
lf you insist.
Wait a minute.
l understand something about psychology.
By telling me not to go, you're trying to get my curiosity up so l do exactly the opposite, right?
Absolutely not.
No!
Probably a friend of yours?
The two of you cooked something up to make me look a silly fool?
- l'm not going anywhere near her.
- Thank you.
Thank you?
That's what you wanted me to do, walk away.
- You don't want me going near her.
- No.
No meaning yes.
Listen, this is my bar and l'll do what l want.
Hi, there.
Hi.
You new in the neighbourhood?
- Yeah, l'm new to Boston.
- How do you like it so far?
- Fine, how do you like it?
- Much better now.
Sorry about this stuff.
l'm sat here waiting for my heat to be turned on.
How hot do you want it to get?
l heard you were kind of a wolf.
Howl at the moon one time, they never let you forget it.
Listen.
While we're on the subject of subgum, ..
how would you like to go out to Chinese food later?
No, thank you.
l'd rather not.
Did l make it clear l meant with me?
Painfully.
l think l like this girl.
lf you'll excuse me, l'll go say goodbye to my bathroom.
Congratulations, Diane.
You and your friend made me look a complete ass.
l hope you're happy.
- Couldn't have done it without you.
- lsn't she great?
You know, Coach, l think you should ask her out.
Ask her out?
l haven't asked a girl out in years.
l don't know if my old lines work.
What was the last one you used?
''How would you like a pair of nylons, Fräulein?
'' - Probably not.
- Come on.
lt worked.
What do we need it for?
lt's just another piece to clog up.
lt's belongs to something.
Don't hang on to things through sentiment.
Coach, how about all the women you talk about in your baseball days?
- How did you approach them?
- Not by talking with them.
What did you do?
l'd spot a cute dame in the stands and to get their attention, l'd ..
injure myself.
- You intentionally hurt yourself?
- Sure.
l'd lean into a pitch or dive face-first into a bag.
Take a hard grounder in the gut, anything to get their sympathy.
You were a sly one, Coach.
One day l wasn't even in the game and there was this real cutie there.
So l threw myself down the dugout steps.
- lt worked.
- You don't have to do that now.
Look at her.
She's all by herself, a stranger in this big city.
You are the only friend she has here.
- Can we have some service back here?
- Coming right up.
Go get her, tiger.
- Coach.
Can you cover me tonight?
- Sure, where you going?
l'm going out with that lady.
Diane is gonna learn the meaning of the word comeback.
Did you say something?
Like?
- Yeah.
- That wasn't me.
Can l have another beer, please?
- Coach, what's going on here?
- Just a normal evening.
l'm pouring a beer.
Norm's in line.
Sam's sweeping the girl of my dreams off her feet.
Normal night.
l thought you were gonna do that.
Come on, Sam's such a smoothie.
When did a woman last turn him down?
Will you bug off?
- Does that refresh your memory?
- l got her on the ropes.
- You're a glutton for punishment.
- The evening's young.
But your lines are old.
Don't worry.
l'm going out with your friend tonight, even if it kills me.
Coach, come on.
Now's your chance.
Go.
- Diane, who needs her?
- Coach.
- Don't give up on Nina.
- Please leave me alone.
Please.
No!
Get in there, you pipe, and no backtalk.
You can't come in here, it's the men's room.
- Carla's in here.
- Carla doesn't count.
Watch it!
- Diane, please, l want to be alone.
- Coach, if you don't act now, your life will be forever haunted with the memory of lost opportunity.
Maybe you're right, l should've tried earlier, but Sam's after her now.
- Can't you see that?
- So?
He's not getting anywhere.
- You got the hots for Nina?
- You know that, too?
Carla, Coach is too shy to ask Nina out.
Come on, will you?
Who wants to date me?
l'm over the hill.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
l'd go out with you.
- Really?
- l would, too.
See?
And we all know how fussy Carla is.
- You're not just saying this?
- No.
Coach, you're a cutie.
Come on over here, cutie.
Look at you.
What a hunk!
You're a pin-up guy.
Look at those shoulders.
Stop it, the two of you.
Who is that stud?
l'm no Harold Flynn, but it's OK.
Coach, it's Errol Flynn.
No, Harold Flynn.
He used to play second base for Chicago.
Good look, no hit.
Diane, Carla, l'm gonna do it.
Just give me a few minutes to spruce up.
Listen, Coach, that's great.
l'll make sure Nina sticks around.
l can't believe the graffiti in this place.
Adolescent men are What is it?
''For a good time, call Diane Chambers.
'' Thank God they got the number wrong.
l got it right off your application.
- Carla, how could you?
- Last time l play Cupid for you.
After our moonlight drive up to the Cape, we'll check into separate rooms, one for us, one for our toothbrushes.
- l wish you could bottle that charm.
- ls that right?
Then l could put a cork in it.
Sammy?
Could l get a beer down here?
l'll be back.
Tell me you're not in trouble.
Tell me you're playing around with her, or l can't go on.
l'm just playing with her.
Just playing around with her Give up.
lt takes a big man to admit he's a small person.
And now Harvard Yard.
lt was here that in 1 535 John Harvard raised his eyes to heaven and announced Line up, the can is fixed.
l let you do this one time but no more.
l don't want you come back.
Sorry about this.
They're studying for finals.
Let's give a little consideration and tiptoe out.
Seems like all we've done all day long was go from one bar to another.
What do you want for eight bucks?
Minutemen?
Move it.
Nina, your super called.
Your heat's back on.
Thanks, Carla.
l sense that we've had some trouble hitting it off tonight but l think l know why.
Put aside for now my technique, my style, my smooth manner.
Put aside my hair, my teeth, my physique.
Put all that aside and what have you got?
Nothing.
l didn't feel like being with a woman tonight.
Goodnight, Nina.
lt turns out we were cousins.
Nina, can you wait just a minute?
The Coach wanted to say goodbye.
OK.
l give up.
The woman's undateable.
Undateable, Sam?
l don't think so.
ln fact, l have a hunch you're about to see that woman swept off her feet.
You're crazy.
lt may seem impossible to you, one whose idea of romance is a floormat and The Bolero played at 78, ..
but you are about to see a man get a date using nothing but sincerity and his own feelings.
She's kinky, huh?
- The Coach?
- He's crazy about her.
l'd have told you but he swore me to secrecy.
- He's been building up his courage.
- Stop him, she'll crush him.
Nina?
Ernie.
l was waiting to say goodnight.
Listen, Nina, l want to say something.
Look, l'm not a rich guy, and l'm no brain.
l'm just an average guy.
But l like you and l'd like to go out and do things with you.
Would you have dinner with me tonight?
That's sweet of you, but l've got a lot of unpacking to do, but thanks.
Yea.
Sure.
Coach.
Look, l got shot down, too.
Listen.
There are some women in this world you can't get to.
- She's all of them.
- l made reservations upstairs.
Goodnight.
lt was nice to meet you all.
- Goodnight, Ernie.
- Bye, Nina.
Coach!
- He's out like a light.
- Wake up.
Ernie, are you alright?
- Are you OK?
- l'm just a little woozy.
- Coach, let me take you home.
- Let me, l live there, anyway.
- You've got all that unpacking.
- Don't be silly.
This is a lot more important than unpacking.
Works every time.
Sam, l might not be in tomorrow morning.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Excuse me.
l'm here in response to the ad in the newspaper about Mrs Tortelli's children.
What, is she trying to sell them again?
- What?
- Never mind, never mind.
Carla?
Yeah?
What is it?
- There's a lady here to see you.
- Oh, yeah?
l'm Miss Gilder.
We spoke earlier about your ad for a tutor.
Oh, yeah.
Have a seat over there and we'll talk.
l'm takin' five.
OK.
Here are my resume and references, Mrs Tortelli.
You will see l teach all subjects.
l have a great deal of experience, and, if l may say so myself, l'm very highly recommended by those for whom l've worked.
Forget that.
Have you ever been in any major military skirmishes?
What?
lt's important l know you can handle yourself.
Just stand up for a minute.
- Give me one.
- Give you one what?
Your best shot, right here.
Coldcock me, honey.
- Don't hold back.
- Waste her.
- Lay one on her.
- Let's go.
You don't really expect me to strike you ?
Six bucks an hour.
Great shot!
Sit right down here and we'll work out the details.
Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!
- Norman What's the story, Norm?
A thirsty guy walks into a bar.
You finish it.
Norman, you are looking especially spry today.
Thank you.
ln fact, l joined a health club today.
Good for you.
Nice facilities?
Excellent snack bar.
Norm, it's gonna add years to your life.
Coach, l felt l had to do something.
Sammy, this guy over here doesn't believe me about your bar slide.
Would you serve one up to save my good name?
- My pleasure.
- Thank you, Sammy.
- Let's get this garbage out of here.
- Clear the runway.
- OK, Sammy.
Any time you're ready.
- There you go.
Hit the bricks, pal.
OK.
How do you do it?
lt's just one of my two hidden talents.
The other is just as impressive.
But you can hardly charge a buck for it.
Cheers.
Yeah.
Just a sec.
- lt's for you, Sam.
- Give me a second.
l'll put you on hold.
- Thank you, Coach.
- All the classy joints do that.
Hello?
Sam Malone.
Hey.
Of course l know who you are, Rick Walker.
Well, it's not too crowded.
lf you're across the street, come on over.
Yeah.
Hey.
You're in luck here.
A genuine Red Sock's on his way over.
No kiddin'?
What are you doing?
Sam, l don't want a Boston Red Sock to come in here and get a glass with lipstick on it or crud at the bottom.
Sit up straight, will ya?
So who is it, huh?
Evans?
Rice?
Yaz?
You heard of Rick Walker?
He can use that one.
Carla For five years, when he pitched for Detroit, we couldn't win a game against them.
Then he signed for the Sox for big bucks and now he's leading the league in early showers.
Carla, he's supposed to be a nice guy and l'm glad not everybody feels like you do.
- Hi, Sam.
- Hey, Rick!
l'm sorry about that.
That's OK.
For me, this is cordial.
- How you doing?
- Good.
Nice to see you.
Let's sit and have a little privacy.
Sam, l know it's crazy for a stranger to come here for advice but the pitching coach said you're the only man who can help me.
Well, l'm flattered.
He said if anyone knows about slumps, it's you.
- The legend lives on, huh?
- Sam, can l buy you a beer?
No, thanks.
l don't drink anymore.
Yeah.
l heard rumours you used to hit the bottle sometimes.
Well, they're true.
Did you drink during a game?
Never on the mound.
Sets a bad example for the catchers.
- Did drinking help?
- No.
Quite the contrary.
How about an early shower?
- Carla, come on.
- The guy's a rag arm.
l'm sorry.
Sam, didn't that guy used to be a pitching coach for the Red Sox ?
That's Ernie Pantusso.
He works here now.
Good idea.
Let's ask him some stuff.
Coach, l want you to meet Rick Walker.
Hey, Rick.
How are ya?
Nice to meet you.
- l'll get you a beer.
- Great.
Sorry things are not going good for you.
Coach, l just don't know what l'm doing wrong.
Sam?
Who is that man?
That's Rick Walker, relief pitcher for the Red Sox.
Poor guy's in a slump.
Going through hell.
Try to get out of those things, the worse it gets.
Well, you know what he needs.
Meditation.
- lt gives you total serenity.
- Well, maybe l could suggest it.
Well, it worked for me.
l used to have this facial tic.
Started meditating, right away.
Really?
- Absolutely.
- What kind of tic ?
Well, it was hardly noticeable.
- Come on.
Let me see.
- No.
l got rid of it.
lt's a thing of the past.
So, anyway, suggest meditation.
lt just might do wonders.
- l can see it did wonders for you.
- l'm a living endorsement.
Gotcha.
Sam, what am l gonna do ?
Well, have you ever thought about meditation ?
- l tried everything, Sam.
- Really ?
Sam, forget that meditation.
What he needs to do is beef up his sex life.
See the ladies, take the edge off.
He's right.
Sammy's taken more edges off than a carpenter.
Listen, Rick.
ln my day, there was always attractive young dames outside the stadium waiting for players.
- They're still there, Coach.
- Are you kiddin'?
Say hello to Rosie McGonagal for me, will ya?
- Different ones are there, Coach.
- Yeah.
Listen.
Now, he's been in baseball for a long time.
Maybe there's something to this sex stuff.
No, Sam, l appreciate the suggestion but l don't think that's the answer.
Wait just a minute.
Don't say it's not the answer until you've tried it.
- Diane, Diane - - Excuse me.
My name is Diane.
l have done this for years, and l'll tell you, l would be happy to teach you how to do it.
Diane, this is very kind of you but l don't think No, no, no.
Please.
Do me the favour of trying it with me.
- ls she serious?
- Oh, yes.
She's serious.
Does it all the time.
She just said.
That's right.
Er Do you Oh, are you kidding?
Him?
He'd just make jokes.
Well, OK, then.
OK.
What time's good for you?
Well, personally, l like to get at least half an hour in before breakfast, but Look.
Any time's alright with me.
Darling, l like you.
There is something so beautiful about experiencing it outdoors.
Don't people stare at you?
Yes.
Sometimes.
But they end up learning something.
Sometimes people even join in.
All this talk has gotten me excited.
What the hell?
Let's do it now!
Outside?
No.
lt's a little cold and l prefer to take my shoes off.
Sam, could we use your office, huh?
Wait.
l've let this go No, no, no.
We don't need to hear from Mr Sceptic.
Rick here is after something and l can show him where it is.
Start doing different things.
You gotta l dunno.
Maybe discover some rituals or superstitions.
Maybe carry a lucky charm.
l know that sounds silly, but what you gotta do now is break up your routine.
Do you have any superstitions, Sammy?
Well, yeah, l had one crazy little one.
l never pitched to anybody named Reggie, Willie or The Bull.
You did have the lucky charm, Sammy.
Yeah, l did.
That's true.
What was it?
Well, it was a bottle cap that l found once.
For some reason, l picked it up and started carrying it around.
After a while, l figured it had something to do with things going my way.
l sure could use that bottle cap.
lt doesn't have to be this one.
lt could be any bottle cap really or anything.
Sam, you still have it?
Well, yeah.
l just started carrying it around more as a superstition.
- Could l borrow that for a few days?
- This?
Please, Sam.
This could mean my whole career.
Well A couple of days.
Sure.
l guess so.
l can't guarantee that it's gonna work.
Hey, Sam, l'm desperate.
l'll try anything.
- Thanks a lot.
- Don't mention it.
- Let me buy you a beer.
- No, thanks.
l got practice.
l'll see you in a couple of days.
Thanks a lot.
- See ya, bud.
- Best of luck.
So long.
Hey, Rick?
Hey, Sammy?
How about another beer down here?
Sure.
l never thought you'd part with the bottle top.
Come on, Coach.
lt's er only going to be for a couple of days.
lt's not like it's special or anything magical.
Hey, Cliffy.
Here you go.
Gee, l hope you haven't lost your other talent too.
Did Rick Walker pitch again last night?
Yeah.
He got another save.
That old bottle cap comes through again, huh?
That's 3 saves and 2 wins in 2 weeks.
All of a sudden, the city of Boston's in love with him.
- Yeah.
Everybody but Sammy.
- Yeah.
Sam and his pre-scientific notions of magical bottle caps.
You gotta admit.
He's had bad luck.
- l know.
- Sorry l'm late.
What is it today, Sammy?
Nothing too exciting.
l locked my keys in the car.
Hey!
l won the pool!
Cliff wins three days in a row.
lt's uncanny.
What did you have yesterday?
Scrapes and nicks, and he cut himself shaving.
And the day before that, l had stubbing something.
lt still hurts.
Tell me.
What do you like tomorrow?
l see a mine shaft.
Sam, come on.
Tell me you don't think this is because you've lost your talisman.
Look what's happening to Rick with that cap, becoming a Hall of Famer.
- He was on AM Boston this morning.
- No kidding.
What did he say?
l don't know, l left my TV by the heater last night.
lt exploded.
- Were you hurt?
- No.
Luckily l was unconscious in my bathtub.
Sam?
Do you realise that you are causing these accidents yourself?
What are you talking about ?
Well, you've obviously got something else on your mind.
You're not concentrating, You're making these terrible things happen.
Sammy, let me have a Dewar's rot and a red wine.
Coach.
Listen.
How many games did he win with that silly thing in his pocket that he takes it so seriously?
None.
- None?
- None.
Then why does he think it's a good luck charm?
lt had nothing to do with baseball.
l knew it.
l knew there was more to this.
Come on.
Why's it so important?
Please, Diane.
l can't tell you.
l'm sorry.
l can't.
Come on, Coach.
l'm real curious.
OK.
You can ask me a yes or a no question.
OK.
- One question?
- Yes.
Sam, would you take that, please?
Sammy, you grabbed the coffee pot by the sides.
- Yes l did.
- Doesn't it hurt?
Hurt's not the right word.
Anybody have any money down on the coffee pot?
Sammy, you've got to get that bottle cap back.
For the first time in my life, l'd rather be me than you.
Yeah, Sam, ask the kid for the cap, will ya?
He's goin' good now.
Maybe he's rolling again.
He's got the old confidence back.
Maybe he doesn't need it now.
Sam, please, give him a call.
He'll understand.
- Go on.
- Think so?
Absolutely.
Go on.
Right now.
Well, alright.
lf you guys insist.
Wait a minute, Sammy.
You can't call him now.
His game's started at Fenway.
And the Red Sox take the field Well, l guess you're right.
l can survive nine innings, huh?
With your luck, it'll go into extra innings.
That's out, number 3.
Walker has done it again.
He retires the side and we head into the bottom of the 2 1 st inning.
Perfect No kidding.
Norm, is it the 21 st inning?
Let's see l get 22, but this one could be the national anthem.
That's too much baseball for me.
l'm heading out.
Not me, Cliffy.
l'm a real Red Sox fan.
l stay to the very last out.
lt's closing time.
l can't serve you anymore.
Not like it's the World Series or anything.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, Norm.
Wake up, Diane.
Cliffy, let's go do something.
Not tonight, Norm.
l gotta be at the post office soon to pick up my bag.
l gotta go crawl into bed with mine.
Well.
l think l might get on home too.
l'll see ya tomorrow, Sam.
Come on, Carla.
l'll give you a lift.
Nah, l don't wanna miss the game.
You can hear it on the car radio.
How far away is your car ?
- A block and a half.
- Wait for the right moment.
We pause 1 0 seconds for station identification.
Coach, the keys!
Which direction?
One block north and about a half a block east.
Or did l take the bus today?
Goodnight, Diane.
Sam, don't worry about a thing.
lt's gonna be alright.
Well, l guess l'll knock off too, OK?
Yeah.
Yeah.
l could go to the all-night bookstore in Cambridge or l could go home and make myself a cup of tea.
- What do you think l should do, Sam?
- Score!
That would have to be the bookstore.
lt's a high drive.
lf it stays fair, that's a home run.
lt's fair and it's gone!
Right.
The game's over and my baby's comin' home.
May l ask a question?
Could you hold that?
l've got a very important phone call to make.
- You're calling Rick, right?
- Yeah, l think that's his name.
Do you have the number of the bull pit?
No.
They'd probably be in the bunkhouse by now.
Marty.
Hey.
Yeah, lt's, well, it's Mayday Malone.
How are you doing?
Yeah, thank you.
l'm fine.
Listen, is Walker there?
Alright.
When he gets out of the showers, tell him to call me here at Cheers.
Alright?
OK.
Thanks.
l believe you had a question there.
Well, l guess lt isn't important now.
lt's just that l know this bottle cap has nothing to do with baseball and l was sort of hoping that you'd tell me what it's about.
l know you've been curious.
l didn't wanna tell you the real situation cos you'll think l'm silly.
Well, would it ease your mind at all if l told you l already think you're silly?
Yeah.
That might help a little bit.
You see, that little bottle cap keeps me from drinking.
Silly, huh?
You don't hear it speaking, do you?
Well, nothing beyond an occasional little small talk.
lt is a very little bottle cap.
Alright.
l'll buy it.
How does it keep you from drinking, just out of curiosity?
lt's the cap off the last bottle of beer l ever drank, the last anything l ever drank.
l remember holding onto that bottle cap during some pretty rough nights.
l'd wake up in the morning and have its imprint in my palm.
lt was flat cos l was squeezing it so hard.
When l was tempted to have a drink, sometimes l'd look at the bottle cap and it would stop me.
That's a pretty great little bottle cap, huh?
You wanna know something really crazy?
The last couple of nights, l've really had an urge to have a drink.
- lt's probably for you.
- Probably.
Listen.
Thank you.
Thank you for listening.
Oh, well lf l wasn't here, l'd be at home in bed with The Brothers Karamazov.
Don't say anything.
Hello?
Hey, Rick.
How ya doing?
Hey, that's a pretty terrific win you got there for yourself.
Yeah.
Congratulations.
Listen.
l guess you're kinda back on the beam now, wouldn't you say?
You know, l was thinking this afternoon.
You remember l loaned you a bottle cap or something?
Well, it's gonna sound funny but l'm kinda missing that dumb thing.
You did?
Why didn't you tell me that, Rick?
No, that's all right.
No, never mind.
That's What's wrong?
He lost it a week ago in Kansas City.
He was putting off telling me about it.
Kansas City.
One town l've always wanted to see.
Huh?
We'll jump on a plane.
Well, what's the difference?
Easy come, easy go, huh?
Come on, Sam.
Let's get out.
Go home.
Diane l tell you what.
Even better.
Let's just talk, you know?
What are you gonna tell me that l haven't heard a hundred times, huh?
Oh, come on, Sam.
lt's important that you not be here tonight, huh?
You don't wanna be in a bar.
Where am l gonna be tomorrow night, and the next, and the day after?
l'm gonna be in a bar.
You're gonna feel better tomorrow.
No.
No, l'm gonna feel better tonight.
Here's an idea.
Why don't you watch me get drunk?
l'll get real sick - Sam, no - Don't.
Just don't.
l guess l gave the wrong one to Rick, huh?
l'm sorry.
Are you alright ?
Yeah, l'm fine.
l knew you could do it.
l knew you could do it.
You're
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
- Excuse me.
- Yes, sir?
Can you see if the table's ready for Phillips?
Sure.
Be glad to.
What was the name again?
- Phillips.
- Phillips!
Lock up your daughters!
The fightin' Double Deuce is on the loose!
- Can l help you?
- You should help me.
l helped you.
l fought the Kaiser when your daddy was in diapers.
- Where's the rest of my outfit?
- What you got on looks silly enough.
l mean the other boys from the 22nd Brigade.
l'm meeting them here.
l hope you're not expecting a whole brigade?
l'm low on lemons.
No, just the guys from my squad.
What's left of 'em.
l'm Buzz Crowder.
Sam, l got this one.
Buzz, l'm the fella you talked to this morning.
l didn't recognise the uniform on the telephone.
Come on.
Let me show you the back room.
lt's in the back.
Sorry about that.
Can l get you a drink?
l don't drink.
But keep plenty for the others.
Lotta catching up to do.
We meet in this bar every ten years to reminisce.
What war were you in?
The First World War, of course.
ls that the one with Clark Gable or Gary Cooper?
Wow!
l'm 85.
What's your excuse?
Baseball!
- What you writing, Slats?
- My thoughts.
That would explain all the blank pages.
l'm writing during the odd moments of the job, much as Jack London did.
Was he a bad waitress, too?
Ladies, please.
Enough girl talk.
Any sex in it?
l've started writing down bits of conversation l hear in the bar.
Sometimes people say things that strike me as snippets of Americana.
You mean things said by customers, employees?
- Yeah.
- The owner?
l'm afraid you're not represented.
Just my luck.
She doesn't like my snippets.
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!
- What you up to, Norm?
- My ears.
- Want a beer, Norm?
- Does a rag doll have cloth knobs?
There's a lady present, Norm.
Sorry, Diane.
Shot of bourbon.
Sir?
Save your quarter.
That piano hasn't worked in 20 years.
Use the jukebox.
lt doesn't work either, but it's only a dime.
Sammy, why keep something that doesn't work?
Cos no-one else'll give her a job!
Ladies!
- Got something good there?
- Yes.
A remark a customer dropped just a moment ago.
Yeah?
A quotable remark?
Well, it occurs to me that sometimes we find truth comes in a glass.
Or a mug.
Or your face.
Pinky!
You old grunt!
Sammy?
Tinkerbell here, or what?
Buzz?
lsn't he a bit young to be one of your guys?
Of course!
l'm sorry.
From behind you look like the young Pinky Peterson.
You shouldn't grab people like that.
lf l buy you a beer, will you forget it?
Buy me a pitcher, you can kiss me on the lips!
You're alright.
l'll be in the back.
Everything alright back there?
Well, that room is kinda small.
One grenade'll get us all!
This looks like a nice saloon.
We aspire to saloon.
Can l just sit anywhere?
Try the bar.
lt makes good cover during the gunfights.
Hi.
What'll you have?
l'll have a carafe of your house whisky.
- Excuse me?
- ls that a bad order?
Not if you're a party of twenty.
- This is my first time in a bar.
- No kidding.
Really.
l was just passing and dropped in to see what it's like.
Does it live up to your expectations?
l expected to see more lost, desperate souls sitting around.
Desperate souls night is Thursday.
All the beer you can cry into for a buck.
- That's very amusing.
- Thank you.
Where's Diane?
l've never had hard liquor in my life.
You see, it's my last day in the secular world.
Tomorrow, l'm going into a monastery.
So this is kind of your last fling?
First and last.
l'll give you a drink.
But take it easy, it sneaks up on you.
- l once thought of being a priest.
- You're religious?
No, l just thought it'd be a nice, peaceful life.
Allow me to dispel your misconceptions.
Thank you, Father.
Can l get you something, Buzz?
Not yet, Sam.
l came out to warn you about something.
Me and the boys have got a little joke we play on each other.
First man here always goes in the back room, strips down to his altogether, yeah?
Then he stands on the table, and when the others walk in, he yells out, ''Lafayette, we are here!
'' - Well, tonight it's my turn.
- Thanks for the warning, Buzz.
Sam, could you turn the heat up just a little bit?
A monk?
Does that mean you have to give up?
Well, as the French so delicately put it, the old?
l have to take a vow of chastity.
l also have to take a vow of silence.
Yep, give up sex, you might as well give up talkin'.
What fun is messing around if you can't tell the guys.
lt's no big deal.
l never had much luck with girls, anyway.
They don't find me attractive.
Kev, you're an attractive guy.
- Diane?
- Yeah?
Don't you think he's a specimen?
Yes.
He's a very attractive fellow.
Come on, l know l don't have any sex appeal.
l'm shy, l'm serious-minded The search goes on for my chin.
Kevin, speaking as a woman, l'm glad you're going in a monastery.
You could be a real heartbreaker.
You're not a bambo, are you?
No A bimbo.
No, it's bimbo, not bambo, and l'm not one.
But you are.
Attractive.
Yeah, attractive.
What a great girl!
Sam, is she taken?
Only with herself.
One drink in four hours.
ls that called nursing it?
No, that's called bringing it back from the dead.
l hate to admit it but Carla just got in the book.
l always say, ''Nurse a drink, starve a bartender.
'' Excuse me, Sam.
Smite me again, barkeep!
- Sure you want another one?
- Yes, l'm rather enjoying myself.
OK, l'll make this one weaker.
No charge for the water.
You needn't worry.
l know l'm a novice drinker, but l've only had one since l got here.
l'm not ready for the lampshade yet.
Excuse me.
You know, Sam, that Kevin'll make a great monk.
He's got a good attitude.
- Diane?
- Yes?
l want you!
Diane, are you OK?
l'm OK.
l'm fine.
l'd like to go freshen up a bit.
Absolutely.
You OK?
Lafayette, we are here!
Here's a little-known fact.
Most of you probably assume basketball was invented in the US, right?
James Naismith, Springfield College.
Good thing l showed up tonight.
Basketball was invented thousands of years ago by the Mayans.
They played it for centuries.
- ls that true?
- Sure.
Watch me get the Coach on it.
Coach.
Got a question for you.
Who invented basketball?
- The Mayans.
- Where did you hear that?
How do l know?
Must've been a Mayan in here bragging about it.
Buy 'em, Sammy.
Comeback time, let's go.
Can l have your attention?
l've been drinking all evening.
Now l have something to say.
lt's down the hall to the left.
First, l'd like to make a public apology to the young lady l insulted earlier.
l lost my head.
- Don't worry about it.
- Apology accepted, Kevin.
Second, may l thank you all for helping me see the light.
lt is clear now l am not fit for the monastery.
l succumb too easily to the pleasures of the flesh.
That's OK.
Don't worry about it.
Tonight Tonight has proven that l belong here, in a bar, drinking booze with seedy degenerates, and getting slapped around by cheap dames.
Kevin, it's our pleasure.
l'm gonna give you a real man's drink.
Coffee.
- Coffee?
Men drink that?
- Men who've had too much to drink.
- OK, Norm, pay up.
- Whaddaya say?
Double or nothing on the highlights?
- Sam, any of my squad check in?
- Not yet, Buzz.
Maybe l won't wait for 'em.
Send me back a ginger ale.
Sam, l want a drink only men drink, something that makes women sick.
l'll give you some more coffee.
No, l want something stronger.
l'll give you yesterday's coffee.
Kevin lt's a big day ahead.
How will you feel, entering a monastery hungover?
l'm serious, Sam.
l'm not going.
- Kevin, you're drunk.
- l am?
Believe me, l know what l'm talkin' about.
What about your calling, Kevin?
l never had a calling.
l talked myself into believing that.
l've always been an ordinary person.
l thought it'd make me special.
He's discovered forever is a long time to go between hayrides.
You're gonna turn your back on God because of sex?
Believe me, sex is not that important.
Well, it's not!
Can sex make stars, or a tree or a rainbow?
Can sex make an ocean or a newborn baby?
Forget that one.
l know just what she means.
l once had a religious experience just watching a hummingbird, hovering next to a flower.
lt's almost impossible to imagine something hanging in mid-air so long.
l guess you never saw one of my curve balls.
You all think a man can't change his life in one evening.
But l have.
l wanna be a regular guy.
l wanna arm wrestle and tell crude jokes and spit on the floor.
And l wanna dance with cheap women.
Carla, let's dance.
Put that in your notebook, l break your fingers.
Kevin, sit down for a second.
l wanna dance.
l'm having the time of my life.
l don't want it to end.
That doesn't even work.
lt doesn't?
Well, then - l thought you said it was broken.
- lt it.
lt was.
For twenty years.
My God!
Kevin, you realise what this means?
l've healed a piano?
lt's a miracle or something.
Wait, miracles don't happen.
Are you sure it was broken?
Yes.
The motor was rusted solid.
How could this happen?
Maybe something or somebody's trying to tell you what to do with your life.
Get into piano repair.
No, wait a minute.
What are you trying to say?
Kevin, you said you're an ordinary person.
Maybe you're not.
Maybe you have a direction.
- You might as well try and find out.
- You're right.
l've come too far to let one night in a fleshpot change my whole life.
- Yes.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.
- Hey, kid, alright!
Thank you.
You're welcome!
Good night, Kev!
- Bye, Kevin.
- See you in church!
Good night.
Boy, that was inspiring!
- Sam, did you get that piano fixed?
- No, l didn't Did you?
Yeah, a couple of days ago.
l meant to tell you about it but it slipped my mind.
Coach, why did you find it inspiring if you got the piano fixed?
Gee, Diane, that piano's been busted for what, twenty years?
Why did l suddenly decide to get it fixed?
This would make a great bar story.
Too bad we're all here.
- Poor Buzz.
He's breaking my heart.
- None of his buddies showed?
No.
He's back there alone, throwing darts.
- He's been at it an hour and a half.
- Poor guy.
They'll never make a pack big enough to carry the loneliness of a soldier.
Nah!
Sam What do l owe ya, Sam?
Nothing, Buzz.
The room's on us.
Forget it.
Why, thanks.
Hey, Buzz?
l was in the army myself.
Fort Dix.
Yeah, l served in the navy, Buzz.
ln Pensacola.
l was in the reserves.
l was never in the Army, but l did serve in uniform.
l was a Brownie.
l won merit badges.
l was in Saint Cletus's Correctional lnstitute for Wayward Girls.
We used Brownies for firewood!
You know?
Every reunion we've had has thinned out a little more.
l guess this is the last one.
l guess l'm the last one.
Or maybe they just forgot.
People get busy, make other commitments.
Yeah.
Maybe their lives aren't going well, so they don't wanna come see you.
Maybe they never liked you.
Those guys would never just forget.
No, not after the things we went through together.
No, sir.
l'm gonna miss these reunions.
Wait.
lf you want some buddies to get together with, we're here.
We're not old coots like you, but we feel like we know ya.
lntimately!
Look, Buzz, maybe we could have a reunion every ten years.
Why ten?
What's wrong with every year?
How's about every week?
Every ten years will be fine.
Come on, Pinky, l'll beat ya at darts!
Yeah?
We'll see about that.
Come on, everybody.
You don't need me now, do you?
l've got an early class tomorrow.
- No, that's alright.
You can go.
- Thanks.
You know something?
Loneliness is a good thing to share with someone.
Wow Wow?
''someone.
'' Would you get my purse for me?
This has been a great day.
How could l have known when l woke up that l would meet a monk and a doughboy?
Two men with one foot in heaven.
That's good!
Wait.
Wait a second lt's not like this is important to me or anything, but are you aware l'm the only person in this bar who's not in that book?
Really?
When l played baseball, l was quoted all the time.
Reporters hung around, waiting for me to say something intelligent.
l know the feeling!
Sam, come on, that was a joke!
No, it's not.
You think l'm too dumb to be in that book.
Sam, there are a lot of people in this book just as dumb as you are.
Now, look.
l want natural poetry, OK?
l want spontaneous statements.
You've been trying too hard.
Fine!
l don't want to be in that stupid, pretentious book, anyway.
You've been writing some pretty stupid stuff in it.
l've heard some of that stuff.
lt's stupid.
What does a stuffed shirt know about blue-collar poetry?
That's good, that's really good.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
- Evening, everybody.
- Norman.
- What's new, Norm?
- Most of my wife.
You were going to Maine for the holidays with Vera?
- Yeah, l am, Coach.
- What happened?
Nothing.
Vera drove up last night.
l had to stay for an interview.
l'm gonna drive up tonight.
She left me the directions here.
- Should have no trouble finding it.
- Getting away, Norman?
Yeah.
We got just the two of us.
Big trees up there, you know.
They got a frozen lake, one radio station.
lt sounds very romantic, Norman.
Yeah, it does, doesn't it?
Where can a guy go for a good time around here?
Enjoy.
No, wait, pal, l can't.
l can't do that to the navy.
lf you're in the mood for gum, l can get you a fresh stick.
Actually, l was looking for bugs.
Try the blonde girl's hair.
- Say, you're from England?
- How'd you guess?
You sound smart even when you say stupid things.
l hope you won't think me presumptuous, but dark, exotic women like you bring a fever to my blood.
Wow!
Classy!
My name is Carla.
What can l get ya?
How do you do, Carla?
My name's Eric Finch.
Gin and bitters will do.
You have an interesting profile.
Neapolitan, right?
My grandfather was from Naples.
We have a saying in my business, ''Giving your heart to a Neapolitan girl is like forgetting to burn your code book.
'' Blast.
Now l've bloody well done it.
- You're not a spy?
- Please, don't say anything more.
You might jeopardise my life You see that man?
Yeah.
He might be the secret agent from a foreign country's intelligence.
l'd hate to live there.
Alright, here's a little-known fact.
The smartest animal is the pig.
- What?
They look pretty stupid.
- Yeah, your average oinker.
Scientists say if a pig had thumbs and a language, he could be trained to do manual labour.
Be part of the workforce?
Yeah.
They'd give 30 years loyal service, then at the retirement dinner, you could eat 'em.
- Alright.
- The smartest animal's a pigeon.
A thousand cars on the turnpike, they find mine.
No, l have to give my vote to the ants.
- How do you figure that?
- See those farms they build?
They build those without plans.
To ants.
For all you do, this one's for you.
Coach, who do you say is the smartest animal?
l gotta say Francis the Talking Mule.
No, you're not catching on here.
That was a real guy talking.
lt wasn't that he could talk, it was what he said, right?
Yeah, it was a lot better than that drivel Mister Ed was giving us.
- Good point.
- Sam, a gin and bitters.
Hey, everybody, come here.
Don't look suddenly, but there's a guy over there who's a secret agent.
- That's ridiculous.
- Thanks for being so cool.
- You mean like a spy?
- You mean like James Bond?
Norm, Jack, it's stakeout time.
- What makes you think that?
- He kinda opened up to me.
l was sitting talking to him and he said he thinks l'm sexy.
They're trained to lie.
You know, Diane, he just got back from Ankara.
He says l'm cuter than any Bulgarian girl.
Well, l'm not surprised, Ankara is in Turkey.
Great.
l really wanted to know that.
Another fascinating fact from the answer geek.
- What's the matter with her?
- You're always correcting people.
- No, l'm not.
- l stand corrected.
- That doesn't count.
- l'm wrong again.
All l said was he doesn't sound like he knows what he's talking about.
Who'd make the mistake of thinking Ankara's in Bulgaria?
Well, Francis wouldn't.
lf you're a spy, why have you got your back to the door?
Because l can see the door reflected in your beautiful eyes.
That old line.
Your eyes remind me of an etching l bought in Norway for 200 guilders.
- Norway's currency is the Krone.
- Diane.
lf you have a licence to kill, can l use it a second?
- She's right.
- She is?
Of course.
That how we broke down Norway's economic system by infiltrating the government with foreign currency.
- ls that right?
- Diane.
That way we undermined the people's confidence and their totalitarian regime.
Norway doesn't have a totalitarian regime.
Hey!
Get it over here!
Pardonnez-moi.
l believe my employer craves a word.
- You bellowed?
- Yeah.
What are you trying to do?
l don't believe that guy's a spy for one minute.
He's lying.
What?
A customer in a bar is telling tall tales to impress a waitress?
Call 60 Minutes.
Alright, when you put it that way.
The thing is.
Look, why do you suppose people come to bars?
Let me take a wild stab at that.
Perchance to drink?
Wrong.
They come here to shoot off their mouths and get away with it.
ln this bar everybody gets to be a hero.
What's the harm?
Sam, any kind of lie is eventually destructive.
l was raised and educated to prize truth above all else.
This from a woman wearing rubber eyelashes and a padded bra.
- That's a lie.
- l'm gonna need some proof.
Look, all l'm saying is, if this guy wants to be a spy, humour him, indulge him.
- Sam.
- Come on.
What's the big deal?
- OK, he's a spy.
- There you go.
Excuse me.
Carla here, she inadvertently blew your cover.
Oh, boy!
So, l understand you're in the spy game?
Yes, sir, what's it like to be a spy?
We swear not a word you say will ever go beyond this room.
We never go beyond this room.
Can l really trust you chaps?
- Yeah, sure.
Everybody swear.
- We swear.
- Cross my heart.
- Alright.
What you've got to understand, is that we're not all like how we're portrayed in the cinema.
We don't think we're heroes, we're just doing a job, putting our lives on the line for democracy.
Tell us about your most hair-raising mission.
You ever get betrayed in the sack by a Russian babe?
Let me tell you about Russian women.
The cold weather makes them very passionate.
Lake Winnemucca, here l come.
You asked me about my most exciting adventure.
l think of Romania, 1 973.
Yes.
l was captured by the dreaded RPB.
The Ripba.
They're every bit as fiendish as you've heard.
They even used the infamous twister on me.
The devils.
- What's the twister?
- lt's a ride at Coney lsland.
Those animals.
- Diane, why don't you just shut up?
- Carla, he's been lying to you.
- OK?
- No, he hasn't.
You are not a history expert, you majored in poetry.
Tell her you haven't been lying, Eric.
Tell her you haven't been lying, Eric.
She's absolutely right.
You've been lying the whole time?
The whole time.
Let me get this straight.
Cold weather does not make women passionate?
l'll see Vera in the spring.
Why did you lie to us?
Because my life is very unexciting and it's very dull.
l've been a failure at everything l've tried to do.
But, you know, sometimes late at night in a friendly bar, ..
l sometimes can make someone believe that l'm interesting.
But you're much too smart for me.
You don't need any illusions.
Good night, miss.
Before you say anything, l want you to know that l could not feel any worse than l do right now.
l'm so sorry.
l forgot the tip.
Merry Christmas.
Wrong again.
l failed.
l blew it.
l quit.
l don't belong here.
There's no point arguing about it.
Who's arguing?
l am opinionated, l am stubborn, l am smug.
A little louder, they can't hear you in the back.
l'm a total washout as a cocktail waitress.
l don't belong here.
- Stay in touch, kid.
- Carla.
Diane, please, listen.
l don't know exactly what's going on here, but it looks like you booted a grounder, right?
Right.
You know what l'd tell a player when he made a mental error?
What?
Nothing.
That's why l got fired.
Wait.
Come back here.
Look, you made a mistake, that's all.
Go find the poor guy bring him back and apologise.
A wonderful idea, but where would l look?
l think your British Embassy could probably help you there.
l've got a good ear for dialects.
My instincts tell me, limey.
His name is Eric Finch.
Alright, l'll do it.
l am going to comb this city.
l'll look everywhere, every hotel, restaurant, cheap dive.
l'll find this man or die trying.
Excuse me.
Look who's back!
l just came back to try and explain why l did what l did.
No.
Mr Finch, everybody in the bar exaggerates a little.
Sure.
For example, l'm not really this good-looking.
Everybody in bars tells stories.
You just got a little carried away.
Right.
l'm afraid l'm the victim of an overactive imagination.
When you spend 1 2 hours a day in a room alone writing, sometimes you just lose touch with reality.
So l'm awfully sorry and l beg your pardon and good night.
No.
You write?
Yes.
Mostly verse.
Farewell.
Wait.
You write poetry?
l'd love to hear some.
We all would.
- Yes.
- Yeah.
lt's not often we have a guy in here who can write poetry.
A guy in the men's room, Sam, writes some terrific stuff.
- Gin and bitters?
- Yes.
Thank you.
- Are you published?
- No.
l don't even send my stuff in.
- l'm not very good.
- Don't be silly.
Let me be the judge.
l majored in poetry.
- l thought it was philosophy.
- No, it was psychology, but that was before Literature and after French.
No, that was after Art History.
- And before Anthropology.
- We're forgetting lndian Studies.
- And Manchurian Folk Dancing.
- Alright.
At any rate, l would love to see some of your work.
l've don't have anything with me.
lt's all in here and here.
- l must hear one.
- Really?
Yes.
Alright.
l'll try something.
How did it go?
''She l love, alas in vain, Floats before my slumbering eyes; And when she comes, she lulls my pain; And when she goes, what pangs arise.
'' - My God, that's lovely.
- l liked it.
What do you think?
lt'll look great up on the tiles.
Mr Finch, l am awestruck.
- Me, too.
Great.
- Please, tell us more.
Maybe not so soon.
Give us a chance to rub down the goose bumps.
This is a night l will never forget.
lt so happens that l am on speaking terms with a poetry editor at The Atlantic Monthly.
He spoke at my college once.
l'll call him and tell him about you.
Wait.
Aren't you getting a little carried away here?
May l have the phone?
Yes, and loving it.
Humouring him's one thing.
He can have all the fantasies he wants here.
But you're going too far to make him feel good.
Sam, the poem he wrote is excellent.
Scratch a liar, find a poet.
- He memorised one.
What's it prove?
- We are now in my area of expertise.
When we want to talk about poetry, we come to me.
When we want to talk about jock itch, we come to you.
Yes.
May l speak to him?
This is Diane Chambers.
He's chatting with John Updike?
Well, interrupt.
No, l'm not kidding.
l have something that makes Updike seem like small pommes de terre.
- Diane, l wouldn't do this.
- Yes, l'll wait.
Would you leave me alone.
Mr Finch, he really should hear this directly from you.
Come over, please.
What is your best work?
There's a little something l dashed off this morning.
Wonderful.
Hello, my name is Diane Chambers.
Yes, l know you're busy, but l have a wonderful surprise for you.
Just listen for a moment.
Verse alert, Cliffy, strap yourself in, pal.
Dive.
Excuse me, we are about to make literary history here.
Hello.
''My heart is like a singing bird Whose nest is in the watered shoot;'' Now, that's a poet.
Thank you.
''My heart is like an apple tree Whose bough is bent with thick-set fruit; ''My heart is like a rainbow shell That paddles on a halcyon sea; ''My heart is gladder than all these things Because my love has come to me.
'' The nuns taught us it in school.
l get tears just remembering.
No fooling.
Tears?
Yeah.
They whacked us with their beads.
Yes, Rossetti, you're right.
Thank you for settling that bet.
Wonderful.
To whom could l speak about a subscription.
l?
l don't believe this guy.
You cannot believe a word that comes out of his mouth.
lf you could fix TVs and crack walnuts on your forehead, you could be my ex-husband.
Mr Finch, whatever, l don't know what your real story is, and the last thing l want is for you to tell me, but l wanna thank you for entertaining us.
- l'm really glad you came.
- Thank you, Sam.
- My real name's Thomas Hilliard lll.
- Well, whatever.
You have a very charming saloon here.
Thank you.
l'm glad you like it.
To show you how much, l'd like to buy it.
How much is it worth to you?
He's not gonna give up.
Wait, let me guess.
You are an eccentric millionaire who hangs around bars and tells stories about himself to have fun with people, right?
Kinda like Howard Hughes, Mr Hilliard?
Don't mention that name.
He died owing me money.
- Well, Sam, how much?
- Well, gee, this is kinda sudden.
Let's see, l guess, 20, 30 people come here every night.
- $1 million seems fair to me.
- You've got it.
- Sam, you're forgetting the jukebox.
- He's right.
Sorry.
$2 million.
l think you're taking advantage of me, Sam.
Hey, look at me everybody.
Scratch a bartender, find a millionaire.
This is not funny any more.
l was right about him.
He's a sick man with a very warped sense of humour.
He doesn't care who he hurts.
He's a pathological liar.
Excuse me, Mr Hilliard.
Oh, my God!
l just wanted to let you know l'm here with the car.
Thank you, Robert.
l'm ready.
l'm sorry we couldn't do business, Sam.
Million and a half and l'll throw in a blonde waitress.
Those papers have arrived from Geneva.
l'll sign them on the plane.
Sam, will you ever be able to forgive me?
- Come on, l'd never sell this place.
- l got the date.
l've never felt so abused.
l was wrong every step of the way.
l thought he was lying when he was telling the truth and vice versa.
From now on, l will not believe anything anybody says.
- You don't mean that.
You serious?
- You bet l am.
You know, l think l'm falling in love with you.
Really?
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
You know, Sam, this is my favourite time of day.
What's that, Coach?
Closing time?
No.
1:37.
I don't know.
There's just something about it.
I know what you mean.
I suppose we've all got our favourite 1:37 story.
What's your favourite time of day, Sam?
Gee, I don't know.
8:15's nice.
Yeah.
I used to like 8:5.
I think I kinda grew out of it.
Wait a minute.
Coach, Sammy.
I don't want to be left alone locked up in this bar all ni Quarter to three No one in the place except you and me Once in a while, a man needs a little time to himself.
- Evening, everybody.
- Hi, Norman.
Beer?
Nah, I'd probably just drink it.
What's new, Norm?
I just came from a late lunch at the Copley Plaza.
You had lunch at the Copley?
Yeah.
I took a prospective employer there.
Courting the guy.
- What did you have?
- The rack of lamb for two.
Don't remember what he had.
I saw Teddy Kennedy over there.
Whoa.
Norman, really?
I still say that Kennedy will be president some day.
No, wait.
Maybe even next time.
You know how politicians are.
- Doesn't make sense.
- I really don't think so, Diane.
I've got a pet little theory about that.
You see, if you go back in history and take every president, you'll find that the numerical value of each letter in their last name was equally divisible into the year in which they were elected.
So who's gonna win, Cliff?
Reagan again?
Mondale?
No.
Not a chance.
See, I figured it out.
By my calculations, our next president has to be named Yelnik Mcwawa.
That's the stupidest name I ever heard.
Sam, please.
You're talking about our next president.
So, Norm.
What was Kennedy doing at the Copley?
Having lunch.
I got his autograph.
You disturbed him during his lunch?
No.
God!
I waited till he went to the men's room.
Mart Martie Broder?
I got the wrong stall.
I dunno.
Ho, Cliff.
Isn't that Tibor Svetkovic?
- Svetkovic, where?
- That's Svetkovic all right.
Based on the fact that he has a long name that you can all pronounce, I guess that he's an athlete.
Or will he be president in 1990?
Diane, the man was Czechoslovakia's greatest hockey player.
He defected to us just to play in the NHL.
It's an incredible story actually.
He dressed up as a woman, hid in a haystack, crawled on his belly under barbed wire, swam a couple of rivers and stowed away on a tramp steamer to get here.
Amazing.
The next week, the rest of his team came over on the Concorde.
That's what he gets for not reading his schedule.
Nobody said he was a smart hockey player.
Is this my day, or what?
First Teddy Kennedy now Tibor Svetkovic.
You better memorise his shoes, you might want his autograph later.
Tibor, I see you play all the time.
I'm Sam Malone.
Your problem may be too much caffeine.
Sorry, what?
He's learning English from TV commercials.
And who are you?
I'm Lana Marshall.
I'm Tibor's commercial agent.
Is that right?
I'm Sam Malone, the boss here.
You're the boss?
You're gonna tell me what to do?
Something tell me you know what to do.
I know what I like to do.
That's nice.
I like the lady who knows what she likes to do and does what she likes.
The mating ritual of the horny-breasted lounge lizard.
Two beers.
Let me take care of you two here.
- Tibor.
Miller Time?
- TV!
Yes, sir.
- What can I do for you?
- What's your speciality?
I do everything the same round here.
- Great.
- Then why don't you surprise me?
- It would be my pleasure.
- Mine too, I hope.
- I'll be right back.
- I'll be right here.
She'll be here, he'll be back and I'll be sick.
So, you get jobs for professional athletes to be in commercials?
Yes.
As a matter of fact, I specialise in male athletes.
Don't you know who you were just talking to?
That's Sam Malone.
Cute guy.
Too bad he has dandruff.
- He used to play with the Red Sox.
- Really?
Who does he play with now?
You know, you give broads a good name.
Excuse me, could I ask you a question about your boss?
The king of the single entendre?
Tell me, does he have a wife, or worse, someone he cares about?
He's available and very desirable, if lummox is your cup of tea.
And it appears to be.
Tibor, I think it's time to get to the Garden.
I'm late.
After game, your room?
No, Tibor, I think I'm going to be busy tonight.
OK, goodbye.
And this concludes another day of programming.
Sooner or later, you'll own General.
Poor guy should really think about wearing a helmet.
I understand that you were an athlete.
I'm sorry, I don't remember you.
That's all right.
I was a relief pitcher before they became famous.
- I missed it by a year.
- Have you done any acting?
Well, you know, yeah, I have.
I had the lead in a school play.
The one about the evil woman who pushes her husband into getting rid of people for more and more power.
You mean Macbeth?
No.
How Boots Fooled the King.
- Was that what Macbeth was about?
- Tibor's looking better, isn't he?
Excuse me.
I'll be right back.
- Hey, Diane, we're talking here.
- She's talking.
You're killing time between thoughts.
You got a problem?
Look, Sam.
Just watch it, OK?
She's not one of your usual bimboettes.
That's what I like about her.
She's got a lot of class.
While I have never been a big fan of the women you date, I will say that at least they were too stupid to be harmful.
I knew they'd grow on you.
Is there something between you two?
No.
That's just business.
I never mix in her personal life and she mixes in mine.
I've just been talking to my secretary about the winter schedule.
I think there might be some commercials you might do very well.
Me?
You're kidding.
No.
You have a very sexy, playful quality that would come across on camera.
Wait, I haven't played baseball for years.
I'm not exactly a household name.
Non-star athletes are in vogue.
They come across as regular people.
What do you say, Sam?
- I gotta think about it a bit.
- Come on, do it.
You're a natural.
Look at you.
You're tall, handsome, you got a great smile.
Show her your smile.
I'll be damned.
Who the hell was I thinking of?
You know, I have to admit, all these years watching those commercials, I always thought I might be pretty good.
Let's do it.
Wonderful.
Look, I'm staying at the Ritz.
Why don't you come over later and we'll work out the details?
I don't get off until two.
All the better.
All these people at the bar and no one introduced us.
No, they didn't.
I'd like to thank each and every one of them.
Me, too.
Now for Fields Light Beer, former Red Sox pitcher, Luis Tiant.
After the game, I like to sit back, light up a cigar and enjoy a Fields Light Beer.
Hey, Luis.
Hey, Sam.
When you get to be my age, 30, you don't want to get filled up.
That's why I drink Field Beer.
It's refreshing, satisfying, and you don't full feel with Field, you just full fine.
Full feel with Field, you full fine.
Sorry, Luis, I don't think you've got it.
I'm pulling you out.
- Skipper, let me stay.
- Sorry, big guy.
Go get them, Mayday.
Now pitching, Sam Mayday Malone.
Fields, it's refreshing, it's satisfying.
You don't feel full with Fields, you just feel fine.
Alright!
Another save.
I still get the win, don't l?
You were great.
Coach, two bottles of Fields right here.
Normally I wouldn't use that to shampoo my dog but you sold me.
Sam, you could sell me ice cubes in summer.
You're in showbiz now.
You're a star.
Sam, could you introduce me to Gene Tierney?
- I don't know Gene Tierney, Coach.
- OK, be that way.
Come on.
How about a speech from the big actor?
Yeah, how did it feel to see yourself up there, Sammy?
It was nice.
It was very nice, OK?
I was afraid of this.
We have to sedate the man, he's hysterical.
Sam, if there's anything you wanna talk about, get off your chest.
There's nothing I wanna talk about.
I'm as giddy as a schoolgirl.
Just wait on some tables.
Fine.
Sammy, that agent of yours is hotter than a pistol.
She's really earning her ten per cent.
Listen, will you just leave me alone?
Please, got that?
Leave me alone.
- Sam, let's talk.
- There's nothing to talk about.
It's important.
Come back to the office now.
Sammy's in trouble with Miss Chambers again.
Sammy's in trouble with Chambers.
What do you want?
Sam, you're obviously unhappy and everybody just wants to know why.
I'm not unhappy.
- You're not?
- No.
- You're happy with the commercials?
- Yes.
- Think you were good?
- Yes.
- Really?
- Yes.
Well, what is it, then?
Are you happy with the money?
yes.
- Are you happy with the auditions?
- Yes.
- Are you happy with your agent?
- Oh, God!
The Dragon Lady.
Tell me about it.
Why?
You wanna hear me say you were right?
Of course not.
Knowing that and knowing you know it and are tortured by it is plenty for this country girl.
I'm sorry.
I am sorry.
I do wanna help.
Come on, let's talk.
You wanna hear about my relationship with another woman?
Well, Maybe Maybe I should find a man out there who's intellectually capable of helping you.
All right, everybody line up for the ugliest tongue contest.
Alphabetically by height, over here.
It appears that all the other intellectuals are busy.
You're sure you wanna hear this?
I'll stop you before I get the vapours.
You see, my relationship Lana and I are a lot friendlier than most agents and clients.
Friendlier?
You know me.
I'm never against a wild night of friend-making, but There's some Now I feel that I'm supposed to be friendly on demand.
And you're afraid she'll stop getting you commercials if you stop being friendly?
When you play in the bigs like I did, you get used to attention.
When I stopped playing baseball, I felt something missing in my life.
I was just hoping that these commercials would get it back for me.
Sam, Lana gave me a message for you but I can't remember it.
- Lana's here?
- That's it.
By the way, what are you two doing?
We got a lot of customers out there.
I got a problem.
Diane's helping me talk through it.
Look, Sam, let me tell you something.
You've faced a lot of tough problems.
You always found a solution but since Sir Isaac Hayes came along No offence, Diane, I love Sir Isaac Hayes, but since then, it's been talk, talk, talk.
This is a pretty complicated problem, Coach.
You see, Sam wants to break up with Lana, and he knows he should, but he's afraid that he will sacrifice his acting career.
- See?
- I don't understand what's going on.
Let me show you something.
Come right down here.
Just, please, come right down here.
Stand right here, Sam.
- Pick that up.
- What do you want me to do that for?
Just pick it up.
Now, get the hell out there and tell her you're finished with her.
Please tell him it's more complic Out.
Hustle.
What do you want me to do?
Hustle.
I mean it.
That was wonderful.
Somehow, your instincts just told you Button it up, Diane.
We got a lot of people out there.
Move it.
Right.
Tell me something, Red.
Are professional athletes better between the old wamsuttas than ordinary men?
I've had no experience with ordinary men.
Me neither, but I'm trying to work my way up to one.
Believe me, athletes take their pants off one leg at a time, like anybody.
They take off their pants?
I'm glad you're here.
There's something I want to talk about.
Sam, what do you think of your commercial?
- It was fine but listen.
- I thought it was wonderful.
I've had lots of calls about you.
- Calls?
- A lot of people saw you.
And they liked what they saw.
One of those calls was an offer for you, a national commercial.
It's big money, and they want to fly you to Hawaii.
You're going to do the commercial with the Osmonds.
The Osmonds.
- The whole family?
- That's right.
- Even little Jimmy?
- Well, we're hoping.
Now, come on.
Wasn't there something I wanted to say?
Later.
We've got to get some pictures for you.
We should buy a new sports jacket.
Afterwards, we can stop off at the hotel for a bite.
And a nibble.
And a scratch.
Coach.
Sam, I'm getting real mad now.
- Lana, we can't nibble any more.
- Why?
I just don't feel right about it.
I see.
Does this mean that you're no longer my agent?
Sam, what kind of person would I have to be to drop you as a client just because of this?
- A dragon lady.
- I'm no dragon lady.
- Good.
- But I am gonna drop you.
I've learned from past experience, once you've had an intimate relationship with a client, you can't go back to being just business associates.
Perhaps it's time for me to find a new face.
My face is new.
Good, you still have time to return it.
She's good, Sam.
- So, that's it?
- Yep.
Good luck in finding a replacement for me in the Hawaii commercial.
If it takes me longer than six minutes, I'll quit.
Boy, she is good.
May I ask you a question?
You want to know how he was?
What?
You think I'm gonna stand here and listen to you tell me how good Sam was?
Fair?
What do you wanna know?
I want to know how you can live with yourself.
I can't.
That's why I like having young athletes around.
I've always been crazy about them.
Sometimes when I'm with one, I swear I can hear the crowd cheering.
I could understand this behaviour from an oversexed adolescent.
- But you're..
- An older woman?
Middle-aged?
All the more reason to grab some youth.
There was a time in my life when men would invent tricks and schemes to get my attention.
Well, now I'm the one who schemes to get theirs.
That's not too unfair, is it?
But don't be too concerned.
Someday, even that won't work.
Don't judge me until the bloom is off your rose, honey.
Ta-ta.
She is good.
Fields, it's refreshing, it's satisfying.
You don't feel full with Fields, you just feel fine.
Alright!
Another save.
Come on, admit it.
I was good.
Come on, say it.
I was good.
- You were OK.
- I wasn't OK, I was good.
What's it gonna do, kill you to admit it?
All right.
You were Good.
Good.
You were OK.
You were good.
And you did the right thing.
Thanks.
Hey, listen.
Before you came to work at this bar, I never thought that much about morality and integrity.
You made me aware of all that stuff for the first time.
Thank you, Sam.
That's why I'm firing you.
You can leave your apron right there.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
- Hello, everyone.
- Hi, Diane.
I am in a wonderful mood today.
I spent the weekend at an lndian film festival.
It left me euphoric.
I love lndian films.
Remember Fort Apache?
Just thinking about it makes the hair on my arms go up.
Look!
No, Coach, we're not talking about American Indians.
I can make the hair on my arms stand up any time I want.
See?
Carla!
Think that's something?
Cathy Settudicato, from St Clete's, belched the whole 23rd Psalm at the talent show once.
That's good, but I knew this guy, Randy Evans, first baseman, he could make his eyeballs vibrate.
I always wanted to.
- Randy Evans?
Who'd he play for?
- Mostly the Cleveland lndians.
Speaking of Indians, remember Fort Apache?
Just thinking of it Go, bumps!
- Hi, Sam.
- How are you, Marshall?
- How's everything at school?
- Fine.
- Could I have a beer, please?
- Of course, Marshall.
Marshall, good to see you, sexy.
- Hi, Carla.
- So, how you doing?
My uric acid is up to seven-point-five.
That explains that twinkle in your eye.
Diane, this is Marshall.
Marshall, Diane.
- Hi, Marshall.
- You'll love this kid, Diane.
Very smart.
Teaches at a college.
- MlT.
- See?
He can spell good, too.
Marshall teaches a subject I know nothing about.
Could you narrow that down a bit?
- I'm in cybernetics.
- Right!
The more we learn about cybers, the better we can control 'em.
Why did you get into computers?
I enjoy integrating formerly unassociated supporting elements to maximise a probability ratio by interweaving the input data.
Watch it, Marshall, I'm heatin' up!
Marshall can make his computer do incredible things.
Write poetry, play games, make predictions on elections, sports.
Sounds like fun.
You got any hot tips for us, Marshall?
The Celtics will lose today.
Watch your tongue, Marshall.
No, let me show you.
Take a look at this.
Can't argue with that, Sam.
You see, this shows correlation between the Celtics' win-loss record and the relative activity of the Van Allen radiation belt.
Isn't that the one that Buster Crabbe wears on TV?
I know it sounds a little crazy, but just by coincidence, I noticed that the days the belt is in a state of flux, the Celtics are always beaten.
Are you sure?
Your computer wouldn't be pulling your leg?
No, my computer never kids, Sam.
He appreciates a good joke, but he never tells one.
- Mind if I borrow this for a while?
- Sure.
- Thanks.
- I have to go now.
- So long.
- Bye.
See you, Carla.
Don't break too many hearts, Marshall.
I get around you, and my testosterone goes up 78 percent.
Do you really find me attractive?
I love a stylish guy.
You've got the new wet look.
Your hair, your palms Coach?
When was the last time you had a sure thing?
- Rosie McGonagle.
- No, Coach.
I'm talking about betting against the Celtics.
Sam, you can't do that!
Come on, Marshall's never wrong.
We've never bet against a Boston team.
We've never done that.
I know.
Think hard about this.
All our customers'll turn against us.
I know, they'd never forgive us.
They'd hate us for the rest of our lives.
Of course, we're not gonna live forever, are we?
I'll get it down.
We can't let any of the boys know about this.
It's gotta be quiet.
I can't even remember what we were talking about.
Sam, we were talking about betting against the Celtics!
Yeah, thanks.
Thanks.
I worry about him.
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!
- Norman.
- What's doing, Norm?
Well, science is seeking a cure for thirst.
I happen to be the guinea pig.
- Oh, boy.
- Rough day?
Yeah.
Vera read a woman's magazine over the weekend about putting romance back in your marriage.
You're in trouble.
She says I gotta act like we're courting.
I got to call her up for a date, buy flowers, take her someplace fancy.
- Sounds good.
- I'm a romantic guy.
I go to the corner, use the payphone, call her up, she turns me down.
Who needs it?
Game time, Sammy.
Turn on the set, pour me a beer and let's start dribbling.
How you doin', Coach?
Cheers.
Diane's busy at the moment.
Can I say who's calling?
Her mother?
A pleasure to meet you, Mrs Chambers.
I'm Sam Malone.
Yeah?
She mentioned me?
No, I'm not scratching myself at the moment.
Yeah, hold on a second, I'll get her for you.
Diane, it's your mother.
Take it from me, you're not adopted.
Thank you.
Mommy?
What?
Oh, no!
No.
I'll be alright.
I'll call you back later, OK?
- Elizabeth is dead.
- Gee, Diane, that's awful.
A member of your family?
Elizabeth Barrett Browning.
She was our family cat.
Cat?
You scared us, Diane.
You should've said that right off the bat.
Diane, did you spend a lot of time with the cat?
Well, since I left home, I've only seen her in the holidays.
Too bad.
Alright, we got tip-off time here.
Not bad.
What a bad bat!
Diane, could I have another beer?
Diane, you working or what?
I am sorry to interrupt, but I have something important to say.
Since I have been here, I have struggled to make certain changes in myself in order to fit in to the general milieu.
- And you're doing a good job - It has not been easy.
However, I am proud to say that, for example, I no longer have to cover my eyes when I watch a hockey fight.
In one case, I even took sides.
But now, in my moment of crisis, it is glaringly apparent that no one here has made any effort to understand my sensibilities.
No, this is me.
Diane?
Something my father used to say when we had a death in the family.
Maybe it'll help.
He'd say, "Sprinkle the ashes, all the tangible remains of our dear one".
"But thank God for the intangibles".
"The impact of his life on ours".
"We remember the smile, the frown, the quizzical look, the love, the courage" Commercials are over.
Fun times, hurt, moments of searching, risk, affirmation, and a whole bunch of other stuff.
Come on, Celtics, go!
- Did the Celtics start without me?
- Yeah.
Losing without him, too.
- How we doin'?
- Down nine, a minute and change.
- We can still win, right, Coachie?
- Sure, Norm.
I wish I had some money on the Celtics.
Don't you wish you had money on the Celtics, Sam?
- Go wait on somebody.
- Good idea.
I'll wait on somebody.
Miss?
I'm all by myself.
I only ordered one beer.
Didn't I see you with other people?
I was here last night with people, but they're not with me tonight.
I see.
They're all gone.
Everything in life comes and goes.
The things that matter most to us are taken away when we can't afford to lose them.
In the end, everything we strive for comes to nothing.
- I'll take away the extra beers.
- No.
Suddenly, I'm in the mood for all of 'em.
Vampira, get to work, here.
Carla, could we talk for a minute?
I really need to talk to somebody.
Carla, please?
Have you ever lost a pet?
Have you ever had a pet?
Are you kidding?
I've been through it a thousand times with the kids.
Goldfish, parakeets, turtles No.
A cat is different.
Yeah, you can't flush a cat.
I know you're not going to believe this, but I do admire you.
I believe it.
You are so tough.
You keep your head up, no matter what.
How do you do that?
I'll tell you.
I always look on the bright side.
No matter how lousy a situation is, I can always find something in it to make me happy.
What good could you possibly say about a loved one dying?
It ain't me.
Extra points.
We've still got time.
- Terrific.
- Yeah, terrific.
Swish!
Larry Bird got another one!
- Another one, already?
- Another one, already?
- They're only down by three.
- Shoot the inbound pass!
Three seconds, shoot it!
Damn, he missed!
- We lost!
- Alright!
Pitcher's elbow.
I lose control of it during intense moments of sorrow.
Coach, I think if I went out and got a breath of fresh air, it might fight back these tears.
Wanna join me?
- No, I feel terrific.
- Join me!
Yeah, I do feel a cry coming on.
Yeah.
Boy, they're really taking it hard.
- Did you ever lose a pet?
- Like an animal?
Yeah.
I never had a pet.
My grandfather had a dog that I loved very much.
- What did you call him?
- Grandpa.
- I meant the dog.
- The dog?
Bruno.
- What happened to him?
- Fell down in the bathtub and died.
- I meant the dog.
- So did I. My grandfather, poor old guy, got run over by a bus.
You know something?
Nobody's ever listened to my story before.
It's good to get it off your chest.
If ever I can be there for you, just let me know and I'll be there.
- Actually - Excuse me.
Jack Daniel's.
Miss, I ordered this on the rocks.
No!
It's not that bad, really.
Sweetheart, it's no problem.
I'm sorry.
I like it this way.
Look!
Good, good!
Darling?
Miss?
Here's a tip for you.
Five bucks for a couple of tears?
I can't believe you're that upset over an animal dying.
You obviously have never had a pet.
I have, too.
- What?
- I had a dog.
Cutest little guy!
Floppy ears, big eyes.
I took him for a walk every morning.
Great way to meet women.
So you loved this dog because you could use him as a come-on?
- No!
- I bet you can't remember his name.
Sure I do!
It was Fluffy.
Or Buffy.
Or was that one of the girls he helped me to meet?
Come on!
What is it you want?
I wanted a little sympathy.
Why didn't you say so?
Sam, there are subtleties of expression.
I have been saying so all day with the look in my eye, the knit of my brow, my posture How come you just don't use words?
No.
- No, I'm gonna sympathise.
- Don't be ridiculous!
- Tell me about your cat.
- I don't want to talk about it.
Well, tough!
Well, I was ..
pretty lonely as a child.
I wasn't close to anyone in my family.
My father travelled frequently, and my mother was incredibly social.
So Elizabeth was my closest friend and confidante.
That cat could really keep a secret.
- That's good in a cat.
- Yeah.
She was the only one in my life who was always there.
When everybody was mad at me, she liked me.
When I'd hide when my parents argued, she'd come with me.
Whenever I was sick, she never left my bed until I was well again.
And then, ..
when I was 12 years old, my parents separated.
It was maybe the worst night of my life.
I actually thought about throwing myself in the lake.
But then I looked down at this cat in my lap and I thought, "Who would take care of Elizabeth"?
She saved my life that night.
And I know, it's crazy and irrational, but, Sam, I can't help thinking that last night, when her time came, she must have wondered where I was.
- Sam, you're crying.
- No, I'm not.
Yes, you are.
Your eyes are all red and your nose is running.
I'm allergic to cat stories.
I can't believe this.
Sam, this is so sweet.
You poor kid.
Wait.
What are we doing?
We're sharing our grief.
This doesn't feel like sharing grief.
Grief's kind of a tricky thing.
Shall we get back to it?
Sam, you're exploiting this situation and it just doesn't feel right to me.
What?
Exploiting?
We got caught up in some wonderful emotions just now, and I would hate to see that turned into something sexual.
- What are you accusing me of?
- I'm not accusing you of anything.
I would just like to know why this is happening.
What difference does it make, why it's happening?
We're helpless, swept away.
What else can we do?
Sam!
You have never been helpless where women are involved.
Jeez!
Your problem is that the only way you can relate to women is sexually.
You wanna know what your problem is?
You always have to think about things, talk about things.
"Why are we doing this?
What does it mean"?
"What are we going to do"?
God, it makes me so mad!
An unexamined life is not worth living.
While we're talking about problems, you want to know what bugs me about you?
- Fine.
- The way you eat pretzels.
- Pretzels?
- That's right.
Three bites.
Not two, not one, like the rest of us.
Three!
- Know what bugs me about you?
- What?
The cologne you always wear is totally without nuance!
That explains the laughter behind my back!
I don't know why I talk to you.
Every conversation we have is an ordeal.
So let's not have any more.
And I tell you something else.
You won't catch me coming on to you again.
- You're right you won't.
- We agree on something.
No, I think we agree on one other thing.
- I am getting the hell out of here.
- Two things.
- Diane!
Wait!
- What is it?
- I'm sorry about your cat.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Alright.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Yes, I'll tell him.
Sam, I just had a conversation with your date tonight.
Bambi.
She said she can't make it.
She's had an accident.
You're kidding.
What happened?
She fell off her shoes.
Gee, that's tough.
That leaves me only two hours to find another date.
- Those are the breaks.
- Not to worry.
The book!
Cliff, I swear, it just gave off a beam of light.
- A little black book?
- Yeah.
Didn't those go out with getting a girl drunk and seducing her?
That's out now?
Let me see.
Christie Leveroni.
Christie Leveroni, come on down!
Come on, Sam, let me dial this one.
It's been a long time since I've run my fingers over a girl's digits.
Norman.
You know, I haven't seen Christie since Woodstock.
- You were at Woodstock?
- A friend told me to go there.
Said it was a great place to pick up chicks.
I should have known you weren't there for the music.
There was music at Woodstock?
Sammy, it's ringing.
Hello.
Is Christie there?
She entered a convent?
Boys, it looks like your idol has fallen.
So what's the number over there?
- Hi, Coach.
- Hi, Diane.
Hey, Coach.
Sam.
Look at me.
- Do I look OK to you?
- Yeah, why?
I just went to renew my driver's licence.
They asked me to donate my kidneys.
No, don't take that personal, Coach.
They ask everybody.
Those highway robbers.
It used to be a lousy two bucks.
- Carla's late again.
- Yeah, I know.
I wonder why.
Sam, you know why.
Why aren't any of us saying anything about Carla's problem?
I don't think we should be the ones to bring this up.
You know Carla, she's proud.
Maybe she just wants to keep this one under her hat, that's all.
Maybe it's not even what we think it is.
- Coach, what else could it be?
- Gas?
- Hi, everyone.
- Hi, Carla.
- I got to go change.
- OK.
What are we all so afraid of?
We've known for well over a month that Carla's Let me be the first to say it aloud.
Carla is pregnant.
That's it, Sam, it's out.
Sam, she is all alone in the world.
She needs some support.
She's probably waiting for us to reach out.
- You people call yourselves friends.
- Why don't you talk to her?
Well, I would, but Carla's never actually called me a friend, unless "doofus" is a term of endearment.
No, don't look at me.
Vera and I don't have any kids.
I don't know anything about the subject.
How come you and Vera never had any kids?
- I can't, Coach.
- Gee, I'm sorry, Norm.
I look at Vera I just can't.
- So how's it going, guys?
- Hi, Carla.
This is Look, Carla, we just want you to know that Well, if there's anything you ever need, just ask us, OK?
Well, since you brought it up, Sam.
Yeah, what?
I'm going to need a couple of hours off at the end of April.
If you don't want to talk about it No, it's OK.
I told the father about it yesterday.
He's been out of town.
I just wanted to tell him first.
Tell the rest of them.
I mean, they're dying to hear.
- I'll go talk to them.
- Alright.
What was I saying?
The weather is really It's always just sort of beautiful.
Everyone?
- I'm pregnant.
- What?
No!
You're pregnant?
Carla.
Well, why didn't you say anything?
I've got a lot on my mind.
I can't remember everything.
Sure.
Busy girl.
Congratulations.
Unless you don't want another kid.
- Of course she wanted the kid.
- Sure I do.
What penniless, unmarried mother of four wouldn't?
See what I mean?
Don't worry about that.
I'll give you a little bump-up in pay.
- Thanks, Sam.
- That's great.
Carla gets a raise for getting pregnant.
I wonder what I have to do to get a raise out of the boss.
You could get a raise out of the boss.
So who's the father?
We want to know.
You're about to see for yourselves.
He's coming in.
I really got lucky this time, boy.
He's a nice, responsible guy, and he is going to support this kid.
That's great.
You going to get married?
Well, you know, actually we probably would, Sam, except it goes against my most cherished belief.
Men are toe jam.
Who is this guy?
Marshall.
- Marshall?
- Carla made love to a PhD from MlT?
Look, guys, if you can't say it in front of me, don't say it at all.
No, Coach.
Coach, Marshall is the father of Carla's child.
Marshall?
I don't believe it, and I believe everything.
- How are you feeling, little mommy?
- I'll make a deal with you.
You don't call me "little mommy", and I don't put your tongue in the blender.
- Come down and sit down here.
- Come on, Marshall.
- Way to go.
- I'm so happy for you both.
- Congratulations, Marshall.
- Congratulations, Dad.
Why don't you have a seat, little Carla?
Thank you.
We have something to celebrate.
A little champagne.
- A toast!
- Serve it up, boys.
I'll get the glasses.
By the way, I recommend the Lamaze method.
I've read about that and it sounds wonderful.
No, forget it.
I got my own method.
Knock me out and wake me when it's potty-trained.
Let's make a toast.
Somebody make a toast.
- Diane, make the toast.
- Alright.
To the baby.
With Marshall as the father, it's sure to have brains.
With Carla as the mother, it's sure to have need for them.
I'm kidding.
What I mean is, to the baby and its luck at having such wonderful parents.
Hear, hear.
What, what?
I think I'd better just lie down for a minute, alright?
Would you all excuse me?
I'll be right back.
I didn't even know you and Carla were dating.
Actually, Coach, we just dated the one time.
One time?
Just once?
It's a funny thing, too, because Carla wouldn't give me a second look before that.
Or since.
But she sure was ready, willing and able that night.
She was a woman possessed.
So the whole thing was her idea?
Yes, I think you could say that.
Not that I didn't enjoy myself, but I had no idea this would be the result.
I was so surprised when she told me about it yesterday.
Would you excuse me, Marshall?
I think I need to talk to Carla.
- You clever girl, you.
- What?
I know what you're up to, you sly boots.
Got to hand it to you, pretty smart.
- I don't know what you mean.
- Yes, you do.
Marshall's not the father of that child.
Maybe he is and maybe he isn't.
Come on, Carla.
You can tell me.
I'm proud of you.
This shows real initiative.
Well, since you already guessed, you're right, he's not the father.
I lied so he'd support it.
What a great, great plan.
Yeah, well, I hate to sing my own praises.
Well, don't sing your own praises.
Why don't you hum a few bars of this tune?
Carla, how could you?
Why don't you sit down and let me talk for a change?
Fine.
I'd had a really rotten day.
I got stiffed twice.
Sam bawled me out for something.
You were here.
I got soaked on the way home.
By the time I got the kids locked in their rooms, I had really had it.
So I sat down at the kitchen table, a bottle of Chianti.
I just started thinking about how rotten my whole life was when I saw his face through the fog in the door window.
- Who?
- Nick, my ex-husband.
Besides everything else, it was our anniversary.
I see.
But I was so down, I figured we could just talk for a while, you know?
So we were drinking and remembering the couple of good times we had.
It was the first laugh I had all day.
He was wearing his black fishnet T-shirt.
I could see his panther tattoo through the little holes.
No woman could resist.
With the rain and everything and the wine, I just got carried away.
Carla, this is the man you once referred to as "seepage".
Sure, Nick's disgusting, but he knows this spot on your earlobe.
One nibble and you are a heaving mound of flesh.
I find that very hard to believe.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- Well, let me just show you.
- Carla, don't be ridiculous.
Carla.
Cliff, no, this isn't what you think it is.
No, it's OK.
I'm an '80s kind of a guy.
- Seen all the right movies.
- Yes.
Well, no.
Cliff, you see, Carla and I were testing a fascinating scientific hypothesis.
Scientific.
I like science.
Step right this way.
Carla, show him.
- Unbelievable.
- I didn't feel anything.
Well, sometimes there's a delayed reaction.
- Maybe if both of you jumped on - Take a walk.
Listen, if you need a trois for that ménage, I'll be in the bar.
Alright, let me see if I have the decadence straight.
When you discovered you were pregnant, you purposely seduced Marshall because you assumed that your husband would not assume responsibility for the child.
- Exactly.
- Depraved.
Now, look here, Whitey.
You know, you can talk, but I got four kids, and I've been raising them alone and it's been damned hard.
I can't take it any more.
Somebody is going to help me ease my load a little bit this time, and I don't care what I have to do to get it.
Carla, it's wrong.
I don't care.
And I don't care what you think.
- What did you guys do to Cliff?
- What's the matter?
We just had to pull him off the wooden lndian.
- Cliff.
- Yes?
Yeah, Cliff.
Sip.
Beer.
Sip, Cliff.
Carla, do you know the story of The Tell-Tale Heart?
- Take a leap, Whitey.
- I'm going to tell it to you.
A young man killed an old man.
While carrying out the crime, he could hear his victim's heart beating in fright.
Ba-boom.
He was very glad when the man was dead and the awful sound stopped.
Then he dismembered his victim and buried him under the floorboards.
Soon, he could hear a sound coming up from the floor.
Till he couldn't stand it any more.
Surely everyone heard it.
Eventually, guilt drove him totally insane.
You can never escape your conscience.
OK!
Tom, I've been cheating on you.
You are a wonderful man and I don't deserve you.
- I'm sorry.
- Wait, darling.
- ls this having any effect on you?
- None at all.
Maybe you need bigger ba-booms.
Diane, would you just leave me alone?
Carla, don't get upset.
Sit down with me.
Thanks.
So, how's it going, Dad?
Great, I think I'm approaching a state of euphoria.
- Coach, could I have that beer?
- Absolutely, Marshall.
Carla, what do you think we should name the child?
We got time for names, Marshall.
The biggest argument I ever had with my wife was over naming our daughter.
She kept insisting on Lisa.
I wanted to stick with the original name.
- What was that, Coach?
- Baby Girl Pantusso.
You know, Carla, I've been thinking.
Tomorrow, I'm going to go to my lawyer, and have a new will drawn up and all of your children will be named as my beneficiaries.
Gee, Marshall, I never expected that.
That's about the sweetest thing anybody's ever done Diane, would you just cut it out with the stupid "ba-booms"?
Carla, Diane's in the back room.
Come on, we got to talk.
You win.
I'm going to tell him the truth.
Will somebody please tell me what's going on here?
- She's going to tell him the truth.
- The truth about what?
Sam, it's terrible.
She lied.
The real father is her ex-husband.
I don't believe this.
I mean, I know the guy.
Her ex-husband is an insensitive, macho pig with one thing on his mind.
- Some women are attracted to that.
- Name one.
Arlene Abrams.
Angela Adams.
- I'm going home.
- No, listen.
Wait a minute.
I'm going to talk to you first.
Sit down.
Now, look.
Diane told me what's going on and I just have to say something.
Marshall, you and Carla have a chance for some great happiness here.
I don't think you should throw it away.
- Sam, you don't - Come on, let me say this.
- Look at me, Marshall.
- Look at you?
Yeah.
Now, a lot of people think that I've got a great life.
But you have a You can have something that I don't have.
You can have the love and the warmth of a family.
You know, if you don't marry Carla, some lucky guy's going to.
As a matter of fact, if you don't marry Carla, I'm going to.
I'm not going to marry her.
- I got the veil in my locker.
- You understand that what Get out of here.
You're all toe jam.
You know, I just feel terrible about this.
I guess she really did want some help with this child.
Yeah, she's barely getting by just the way it is.
Carla's probably never felt lonelier than she does at this moment.
Got any more of those little yellow goldfish crackers?
We don't have any crackers that look like goldfish.
What did I just eat?
I wish I had the money so I could take care of the kid myself.
Me, too, Sam.
Wait, I've got a wonderful idea.
We are always taking up collections for little league teams and to give gifts to orphans.
We are now going to take up a collection to help Carla.
I think Cheers should adopt this child.
You know, that's not such a stupid idea.
We could all take turns doing things with the kid.
- Right.
- I could teach him how to pitch.
I could teach him how to hit your pitches out of the ballpark.
I'll do the kid's taxes.
Coach, come here.
Listen, everybody.
This is for Carla's kid.
It's going to be our kid.
I can teach it how to slide into second base.
You can't.
Remember your back.
- I can teach him how to swim.
- You're afraid of the water.
Well, I can teach him how to tie a Windsor knot.
Why do you think you wear clip-ons?
Well, I can just sit there.
I'm going home.
Carla, before you do, we want you to take this from us.
It's to help out with the kid.
We'd kind of like it to be our kid, too.
When you walk through a storm Hold your head up high And don't be afraid of the dark Everybody, come on.
At the end of a storm is a golden light And the sweet silver song of a lark Walk on through the wind Walk on through the rain Though your dreams be tossed and blown Walk on, walk on With hope in your heart And you'll never walk alone You'll never walk alone
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
OK.
Closing time.
Everybody out.
Harry, how did you get in here?
I came in the back door.
I don't have a back door.
Well, then, it's my secret.
I've been serving him all night.
Diane, you know I don't like this flimflam man in my bar.
Sam, that's a bit unfair, isn't it?
Anyone with half a brain can see through his petty scams and tricks.
You're too kind.
Thanks.
I hope he doesn't try to pull anything on you.
Me?
It is to laugh.
Diane, I like you, you're smart.
Let me help you clean up.
You gotta keep the cover on this table, because the heat from the lights will crack the felt.
Take care of it.
Harry, I'll take care of it.
You can leave.
Let me save you a couple of steps with the check.
I'll pay Sam.
Thanks.
Take care of that table.
Men can't make beds, either.
OK, Sam.
Thanks a lot.
Goodnight.
Harry, the bill.
- It's OK, I paid Diane.
- I don't trust you.
Diane, will you tell Sam it's covered?
It's covered.
Sorry I'm late, but wait till you hear what I did.
This afternoon, I spent five entire hours in a sensory deprivation tank.
Your room?
I'm telling you, it was incredible.
Never have I felt more aware of what's going on around me.
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.
The whole idea is that there's a total lack of sensory input.
What the hell's going on here?
A book promotion party.
How can that be in a place where no one can read?
My old roommate, Tom Kenderson, wrote his autobiography, and I'm in it.
So, it's a press conference for yet another thick-headed jock epic?
There must be confetti all over the Library of Congress.
For your information, this one's different.
It's got a lot of good stuff in it.
- Like what?
- Well, I haven't read it, actually.
- No, no.
- Didn't want to wear out your lips?
I meant to read it last night, but an emergency came up.
- And what was her name?
- Sherry.
That's not the point.
Tom's book should be really exciting due to the times we had together.
It's about how we handled the pressures of baseball.
Guys handle it differently.
Some guys turn to the bottle, some guys chase chicks.
Tom and I couldn't make up our minds.
- So you did both?
- Yeah.
OK, well, let me speed-read this sucker.
And then we can talk.
- How long is that gonna take?
- I'm on chapter four.
I always loved that kid Tommy.
Just a riot.
He was always pulling something.
Is that right?
He put my toothbrush in his sweaty socks, left dead animals in my locker.
One time, him and some guys held me down and shaved my whole body.
You just let him do that to you?
No, Cliff.
He was trying to cram me into a clothes dryer.
I pulled his socks right over his spikes.
Good one, Coach.
What a laugh the guys got.
I could see them through that little window.
They were laughing.
Mayday.
- What a to-do.
- How about this?
Sam.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Carla Tortelli, Tom Kenderson.
Carla, nice to meet you.
I love you, Tom Kenderson.
Look, here's my number and a couple of quotes from past lovers.
- Thank you.
- Come here, sweetheart.
Sam, he breathed on me.
I'm a whole woman.
Coach, get her a seltzer.
- Sam, did you read my book?
- No, I didn't.
I'm sorry.
I really wish you had.
Did you put in that flight to Kansas City when we jumped in the garment bag with two stewardesses?
- Yeah, but - Then I'll die happy.
- Listen, let's get you famous.
- You don't understand Tommy, good to see you.
- How you doing?
- Great.
Remember the time you put the analgesic balm in my jockstrap?
Yeah.
I think of you when I get the itch.
- lt's good to be remembered, Coach.
- My God.
Mr Kenderson, can we begin?
Yeah, let's start.
Let's do it.
Before we start, Sam Malone, come up here.
You all remember Sam, and if you don't, chapters seven through nine.
No, I'm a businessman now.
I keep my clothes on, most of the time.
So, you two were real close?
For three years we did everything together.
We were never apart.
It must've been a shock when Tom wrote about coming out of the closet.
You mean in Detroit?
I was with the waitress, and he came out of the closet wearing a That's not it, is it?
Yikes.
Is this some kind of joke?
I wanted you to read the book, Sam.
It's still hard for me to tell people from the old days.
Sam, you said you two used to do everything together?
No, you misunderstood that.
No.
As a matter of fact, people used to come up to me and say, "You two are best friends, yet you're completely different".
Sam, there's an emergency in the back room.
- What?
- I found holes in the pool table.
Yeah.
Will you excuse me?
Some chick wants to see me.
I can't get rid of 'em.
You guys know how it is.
So, honey, you can't go in the back room without me?
Shut up.
Say it ain't so, Tom.
Say it ain't so.
Thanks for getting me out before I made an ass of myself.
I was fast but you were faster.
It wasn't my fault.
He should've told me.
Sam, he told you to read the book.
Yeah, but He should've known that you'd have been with a woman who thinks Candide is a toenail polish.
I just can't believe it.
The guy was a hound.
He had women everywhere.
We'd go into hotel lobbies, there'd be three or four women holding up kids.
He covers that.
- Where?
- Here, in this paragraph.
- Want me to read it?
- No, I'll read it.
- Right there?
- Yes.
"From the outside, my days in baseball seemed glorious, but the greater my fear became of my true sexuality, the more I compensated with typical Don Juan promiscuity".
- Does that explain it?
- I don't know.
I've only read it once.
He was denying who he was.
He's no longer doing that.
I should've known.
I remember sitting in a piano bar and he requested a show tune.
Sam, I do understand why you're upset.
You're afraid that now, people will think you're No, I'm not upset.
It's just that guys should be guys, Diane.
That's all.
Sam, look.
Your friend Tom's out there.
He needs your support now more than ever before.
He really hasn't changed.
He's still the same guy you used to tinkle off balconies with.
Boy, the world was a lot simpler then.
Sam, I'm sorry about all this.
I thought you'd read the book and it was cool.
I don't wanna cause you any more problems, so I'm gonna take off.
Damn it.
Thanks a lot, everybody.
It was nice talking to you all again.
So long, Tommy.
Tom?
You still a gin-and-tonic man?
Way to go, Mayday.
I make 'em the way you like 'em.
On the house.
Coach.
- Thanks a lot, Sam.
- Can we get more shots of you guys?
Yeah, sure.
You bet.
I appreciate this, Sam.
I really do.
You didn't dump me when I had a drinking problem.
I sure did.
You were passed out at the time.
Where are these photos gonna run?
I don't know.
Mostly local papers.
What's the matter?
Same thing will happen at Cheers that happened at Vito's Pub.
Sam looks as terrific in black and white as he does in colour.
Looking at Tom breaks my heart.
- Hey, everybody.
- Hi, Sam.
We were looking at your kisser in the morning rag here, Sam.
Yeah, I saw that.
Every time I look at this, I feel so proud of you.
I'm kinda glad I did that now.
You're taking real strides in your development as a human being.
A couple of other chicks said so, too.
This human-being image will get me more action than cheap wine.
Always the high road.
Norm?
What was that you said yesterday, when they were taking pictures, about Vito's Pub?
- It's nothing.
Don't worry about it.
- Talk to me, Norm.
Norm, it's best he hears it from us.
Well, go ahead, tell him the story.
- You heard of Vito's Pub?
- It's a gay bar, right?
Didn't used to be.
It used to be a great bar.
I hung out there myself.
What a story, Norm.
- I'm not finished.
- There's more?
One night Vito lets a gay group hold a meeting in the back room.
Gays For The Metric System, or something.
Story got in the newspaper.
Gets a lot of attention.
Next thing you know, Vito's Pub turns into Vito's Pub.
All the regulars left, Sammy.
Out went the oars and the moose heads, in came plants and ferns.
Ferns.
I just don't want that to happen at Cheers.
I don't believe it.
Bars don't turn gay overnight.
You don't have to believe me.
I have scientific proof.
Cliff?
- It happened.
- See?
Excuse me.
You're talking about them like they're ogres.
The fact is, there are gay people in this bar all the time.
No way.
I haven't seen a gay guy in here in ages.
- So you can spot a gay person?
- A mile away.
And there are none in here right now?
Nope.
Looks like a straight crowd to me.
Too ugly to be gay.
Too ugly to be out.
I wasn't going to say anything, but you've proved you're open-minded.
There are two homosexual gentlemen in this bar at this moment.
Come on.
Get outta here.
They told me they were gay, and they appreciated what Sam did.
That's right.
They're here right now and you don't even know who they are.
Nah, she's kidding.
Everybody here checks out alright.
Well, I don't know.
It occurs to me that Cliff hasn't had a date in quite some time.
He's right.
Yeah?
How come we've never seen this Vera you're allegedly married to?
Could we have a couple of beers, please?
You bet.
Patty-cake alert.
- You're Sam Malone.
- Right.
- I saw your picture in the paper.
- That's good.
Can't wait to read that book.
I'm not much of a baseball fan, but it sounds interesting.
- It should be pretty good.
- Could we have light beers?
Light beer.
- There you go.
- Thanks.
Sam, those guys look OK to me.
They are OK, Coach.
Maybe we are a little off base, Norm.
Let's test them out.
I got an idea.
Look at the bagonzas on that babe.
This is medieval.
I never knew Lorne Greene had bagonzas.
Say, Jack, change channel.
It's time for the Benito-Venito bout.
Should be a blood match.
They're not watching.
Let's string 'em up.
What are we gonna do about these guys?
Carla, you're not prejudiced against gays, are you?
I'm not exactly crazy about them.
I mean, I get enough competition from women.
If guys keep coming out of the closet, there won't be anybody left to date, and I'll have to start going out with girls.
Don't worry about me.
I like my dates more masculine than you.
Not much, but a little.
I can't believe you're making such a fuss over two guys in a bar.
- Patty-cake.
- It's an orgy.
Ferns, Sammy.
We're talking ferns.
Come on.
I've seen you guys hug.
- Yeah, but we hate it.
- Right.
Cliff, I haven't been to Clancy's in ages.
ls it still a nice place?
I don't know.
I haven't been there for a while.
- Let's go on over there.
- Good idea.
Clancy's?
Give me a break.
You're kidding?
We'll check in in a few weeks and see if Cheers is still the kind of bar where a single woman can be assured of being harassed.
Get back here, all of you, right now.
You mean to tell me you guys are baling out on me?
I'm telling you, within a month there'll be wild music and guys dancing and exchanging phone numbers.
You know, Sam, you've got some really great friends here.
You've gone out of your way to make a bar where customers can feel like they belong, part of a family.
- Now they're walking out on you.
- We don't want them.
Quiet.
Perhaps we should step into the back room.
Anyone having something intelligent to say can follow me.
Fine.
Anyone with a two-bit opinion.
Alright.
I'll tell you.
Sammy, I've got a simple solution to this whole problem.
You just go up to the guys and politely ask them to leave, and everything is back to normal.
Sam would never do that.
Would you, Sam?
No.
I'm not sure.
These guys are my regulars.
If I lose them, I lose my bar.
If single women stop coming in here, I have no reason to live.
No emotional appeal here, Sam.
This is a purely intellectual argument.
You let this bar go gay, you are gonna have to hire male waitresses.
Right?
That means I'm out on the street, and I'm not gonna be able to feed little Sammy Tortelli.
He kicked.
What?
What's that he's trying to say there?
I'm hungry.
I'm hungry.
Please don't let Sammy do this to us.
Thanks for keeping emotions out of it.
I think it's a trick, Sam.
- Sit down.
- We're all agreed, then.
Sammy tells these guys to leave, we don't go to Clancy's.
- Alright.
- Sam.
Just leave me alone.
I'm running a business here.
What do you think I should say to them?
It's very simple.
You just say, "Hello, we're a group of snivelling bigots and we don't care for your kind".
That's good.
I like that.
Hi, fellas.
Hi, Sam.
What's going on?
I've got a problem.
Maybe you can help me out.
See, I'm the own of this bar.
Yeah, we know.
We read the article in the newspaper.
Right.
- That took a lot of guts.
- It really did.
Yeah.
So what's your problem?
As a matter of fact, I don't have a problem.
Coach, get these guys a beer on the house.
Right, Sam.
Chickening out on us?
Yeah, Sammy, I thought you had more character.
Those guys are staying.
Anyone else wants to leave, fine.
You know what kind of bar this could be?
Not the kind that I have to throw people out of.
That was the noblest preposition you ever dangled.
Thank you.
- Now, let me say this.
- No.
Fine.
Alright, gentlemen.
Desperate times call for desperate measures.
What are you gonna do?
Coach, last call.
What are you talking about?
It's quarter to seven.
No time.
The glasses have to be off the tables by seven.
Excuse me.
This bar closes at seven?
Only on the first Thursday of every month.
Vive la Différence evening.
We go home to our wives, girlfriends, work benches, power tools This is the weirdest bar I've ever been in.
Coach, what the hell are you doing?
This is Vive la Différence night.
- Where the hell did the month go?
- What?
Your regulars just tricked those guys out.
How?
Let's have a round here, Sammy.
- What's going on here?
- We got rid of your friends.
It was Norm's idea.
The man's a genius.
Way to go.
Norman, there's something you should know about those guys.
They're not gay.
In fact, one of them tried to hit on me.
What?
You said they were.
I said there were two gay men here.
I didn't say who they were.
They, along with myself, have had a wonderful time watching you make complete idiots of yourselves.
Yeah, the guys I was talking about are still here.
- Right, guys?
- Right.
Better than Vera.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
I think, if nobody minds, I'll take my lunch now.
Good.
- Coach, would you mind?
- Here you are, honey.
I've got some lovely roast beef for a sandwich.
Carla, if it bothers you, I could eat in the back.
No.
I was a little nauseous before, but I'm fine now.
Great.
You know, I'm starting to feel a little hungry myself.
Would you mind handing me my lunch there, Coach?
Thanks.
Thank you.
Mind if I join you, Diane?
Not at all.
You know, that's another thing about pregnancy: you get cravings.
Green olive, red pimiento, nice juicy anchovy.
Now, you open the little anchovy's mouth.
Red pimiento.
Stuff it into the anchovy's mouth.
Sugar.
I think I've just lost my appetite for ever.
Works every time.
- Evening, everybody.
- Norm!
- Beer, Norm?
- That sudsy amber stuff, right?
- Yeah.
- I've heard good things about it.
- How's it going, Norm?
- Don't ask.
It's no fun looking for work, Sammy.
- You going out on interviews?
- Three today.
My resumé, right.
Last guy I show it to reads it, laughs in my face.
Why would he do something like that?
I'm sorry.
It's just that it's pretty skimpy, isn't it?
You were born, worked at one company, and you're five foot ten.
What you gotta do is pep this up a little bit.
- That's cheating.
- That's pepping it up.
Everybody does it.
It's expected of you.
You just take what's here, just spice it up a bit?
Looky.
There's Diane and her date back from the weekend.
Thanks for dropping me off, Walter.
Bye-bye.
Do you wanna hear me do it one last time?
No, Walter.
I have to get to work now.
Introduce me to your co-workers.
They'd get a bang out of this.
I don't think Hello, Sam.
Walter Franklin, Sam Malone.
- How do you do?
- Ten.
He can tell you instantly how many letters there are in any sentence.
- That's quite a gift.
- 15.
- We've been at it all weekend.
- How many days was it like?
Listen, Walter, I have to go to work now.
- Thanks again for a lovely weekend.
- Two sentences.
30 and 28.
- Stop doing that.
- 19.
- I mean it.
- Seven.
That's enough of this.
I'd better get going.
Goodbye, Diane.
Nice seeing you, Sam.
- Yeah.
- Four.
- By the way, Walter - 14.
Yes, Sam.
What is it?
How was Diane on a scale of 100?
Quite a catch.
- Thank you.
- So's a largemouth bass.
Walter happens to be a distinguished geneticist.
He studies genets.
Nice to be back.
OK, Sammy, we're rolling here.
Those job offers ought to start pouring in now.
"Norm Peterson: thought-provoking, poignant, hilarious, a roller coaster of emotions".
"If you hire only one accountant this year, make it Norm Peterson".
What is this?
He had the paper open on the movie section, Sam.
Here's the part I like best: "At last, an accountant the whole family can go see".
It's no use.
Nobody's gonna hire me anyway.
Hang in there.
Something'll turn up.
You ever thought about doing anything else besides accounting?
I was in the motor pool in the service.
- I learned about engines.
- Like what?
How to use them for shade.
Let's go and have a look at these want ads.
Hello, there.
- Did you have a nice weekend?
- I had a wonderful weekend.
Went to Martha's Vineyard, long walks on the beach, hiked over the dunes, crisscrossed the island on bicycles.
Still couldn't lose him?
You now, you are the last person in the world who should take shots at somebody else's choice of dates.
Not with the coterie of Betty Boops you squander you time, money and hormones on.
- I date terrific women.
- Yes.
And talented.
Without them, the art of gum-snapping might be lost for ever.
At least my dates don't count the number of letters in sentences.
Your dates can't form sentences.
OK.
You like dating nerds, nerds it is.
The next time I decide to go out, I'll check with you first.
That would be a very good idea.
I suppose you know better than I whom I should date?
I do, lady.
I could set you up with the best date you ever had.
- That's ridiculous.
- I could.
Do you want me to?
Would you let me set you up?
Yeah.
Why not?
I'm tempted to do this, to see what kind of a joke you'd bring in.
- I haven't had a laugh for a week.
- Certainly not in a weekend.
- I resent that.
- 11 .
All right, Mr Matchmaker, you're on.
Let's set each other up.
You got it.
You're not gonna pull out on me?
If you go out with mine, I'll go out with yours.
- Tomorrow night?
- Well, I'll have I just thought of the perfect woman.
Yes.
Bright, witty, attractive.
Perfect.
- This is great.
I can't wait.
- All right.
OK.
Two draughts.
Carla, who do I know who'd be a good match for Diane?
What about that guy you used to play ball with, Fred Wilson?
Fred's dead, Carla.
So, she has to drive.
I'm serious.
Coach, who do you think?
You know, Sam, I always thought you'd make a great date for Diane.
Coach, that's crazy.
- Or is it?
- Let me think about that.
Of course.
That's what she's doing.
That's cute.
That is cute.
- Thanks.
I have lost a few pounds.
- No.
Don't you see what she's doing?
She's setting me up with herself.
- That little scamp.
- Yeah.
You heard what she said.
"Bright, witty, attractive, the perfect girl".
She's talking about herself.
Who else?
She's not gonna bring another girl in here tomorrow night.
She wants to go out with me herself.
I kind of like that.
Our first date.
Thanks, Coach.
lf there's anything I can do for you, let me know.
Sam, by the way, there is one little thing.
If you get some time later, could you tell me what we were talking about?
You bet.
I'm looking forward to it.
I'm feeling like quite the matchmaker.
I called my friend.
She said she'd love to go out with Sam.
Carla, do you have any idea who Sam has in store for me?
No.
Sammy, you're looking pretty sharp tonight.
- What's the occasion there, Sam?
- I've got a very big blind date.
- Isn't that a little risky there?
- Not in this case.
Coach.
Sam.
Sammy, watching you get ready for a date is like watching a great matador prepare for a bullfight.
I hate that stuff.
Who wants to see a guy go and manipulate and torment a poor unthinking creature like that?
I always buy 'em breakfast, don't I?
But looky here.
Here comes Diane.
Strangest thing, she appears to be alone.
Mind if I sit here, Sammy?
Enjoy.
- Hello, everyone.
- Hi, Diane.
Hi, Diane.
Sam, ready for your date?
- I certainly am.
Are you for yours?
- As I'll ever be.
Is he here?
Kind of a dumb question.
Of course he's here.
Present and accounted for.
But wherever is my date for the evening?
- She went to lock the car.
- She what?
Gretchen went back to make sure her car was locked.
Gretchen?
The point is, she is a woman of substance.
She's going to challenge you.
- Gretchen?
- Yes.
Here she is.
Gretchen Darrow, Sam Malone.
- Hello.
- Hi.
You and Gretchen have a lot in common.
She's a grad student working on her thesis in kinesiology.
Small world.
That's the study of physical movement, Sam.
Akin to athletics.
She also lettered in three sports.
So, you're the Sam Malone that used to pitch for the Sox?
Yeah, as a matter of fact I am.
Coach, why don't you get Gretchen here something to drink?
Thanks, Sam.
- I can't believe this.
- I knew you'd like her.
I'm a pretty good judge of people.
So, let's see how you are.
Where's my guy?
Your guy?
As a matter of fact, he's in the poolroom.
Shut up.
I'll just go back and get him right now.
You just hang on here.
He's probably right back here.
Excuse me.
What's your name?
Andy.
Why?
- What are you doing tonight, Andy?
- Why do you ask?
No.
I got an extra girl on my hands.
I see.
It's worth $20 if you'll go out with her.
Why give me 20 bucks to take out a girl?
The 20 bucks is for a little lie.
Pretend we've known each other a long time and we set this up yesterday.
What d'you say?
My name's Sam, by the way.
I probably know that, don't I?
What if this girl doesn't like me?
That's alright.
She doesn't like anybody.
What are you looking at, endomorph?
Nothing.
Nothing, sir.
Andy, I'd like you to meet Diane.
And this is Gretchen.
I finally meet Gretchen.
Sam talks about you all the time.
- Gretchen, Gretchen, Gretchen.
- He just met me.
But I knew you'd be coming along any day.
No, this is your date, Diane Chambers.
- Hello.
- How do you do?
Diane, I'd like you to meet my good buddy Andy Andy.
Andy Andy.
That should be easy to remember.
- How do you two know each other?
- She asks good questions.
- Good question.
- We met in the pool At the Y. We do a lot of swimming, kicking, all your basic water sports.
Now we're getting into your area of expertise, aren't we?
Swimming is one of the finest cardiopulmonary exercises.
It's wonderful for the development of the major muscle groups, particularly the latissimus dorsi.
I bet you're kicking yourself that I got to her first.
We're gonna take off now.
You two have a good time.
You two, too.
Andy Andy and I will have fun fun.
So, what do you think, Andy?
How does ltalian food sound?
I've been hungry for Italian food all day.
Anywhere but Via Milano.
That's bad memories for me.
I killed a waitress there.
- We'll double.
- Did you hear what he said?
Listen, Coach, you're not gonna believe this.
- I was just talking to the guys - I'd like to believe it, Carla.
No, coach, not that.
You know who that guy that Sam just set Diane up with is?
Who?
He just got out of the pen after doing 10 years for manslaughter.
That must be them now.
I saw them taking off on a motorcycle.
Diane had to ride piggyback on a motorcycle?
That's great.
You didn't think we were gonna make that last jump, did you?
Here we are.
Anybody need anything?
A five-minute head start?
Why don't we sit down and pick up the conversation where we left off?
So, where were we?
Yeah, that was about it.
You ever dream that you have claws?
That's it for me.
I've gotta run.
Don't get up.
I'm warning you.
Good night, all.
If you'll excuse me, I'm going to go scrape the bugs off my teeth.
Well, I guess that just about does it there for you, Andy.
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.
- Sam, everything alright?
- Perfect.
Hard to tell.
She didn't say much.
Except for that little scream she let out when I asked the waiter for a sharper knife.
Bye.
Is he?
He's gone.
Yeah.
In that case, let me just say of all the cheap, small-minded, creepy, sophomoric pranks you have perpetrated in your long, arrested adolescence, this is far and away the worst.
How could you, Sam?
So, he wasn't your ideal date.
I'm big enough to admit when I'm wrong.
Did you really think this was amusing?
Did you have lots of laughs planning it?
Diane, I swear, I wasn't trying to be funny.
What were you trying to do?
The truth is, I never saw the guy before in my life.
I met him in the back room and I paid him to go out with you.
You hired a murderer to take me out for the evening.
It's kind of funny when you put it that way.
Look, I actually didn't think that you were gonna get me a girl.
What did you think I'd get you?
I Well, I guess I I thought that you were talking about us.
You and me.
I thought that you thought you were the ideal date for me and vice versa.
Really?
- You thought that we?
- I'm embarrassed.
I am so embarrassed.
I understand.
- Poor Sam.
- Thank you so much.
Wait a minute.
What do you mean, "Poor Sam"?
I didn't realise you were carrying such a torch for me.
No.
I didn't say I was carrying a torch for you.
I said I thought you were carrying a torch for me.
I'm certainly not carrying a torch for you.
Then I'm not carrying a torch for you.
Fine.
Sam If you'll admit that you are carrying a little torch for me, I'll admit that I'm carrying a little one for you.
I am carrying a little torch for you.
Well, I'm not carrying one for you.
- Then I'm not carrying one for you.
- You just said you were.
I said that only to get you to admit that you are.
You're making a fool of yourself.
Just admit that you're hung up on me, dammit.
- I am not.
- You are, too.
I am not!
Please!
Do you think I'd behave like this in your home?
Sorry.
Well, we are being awfully childish about this.
Maybe.
Let's leave it at this.
I'm rubber and you're glue.
Everything you say bounces off me and sticks to you.
- You love me.
- I do not.
- Do, too!
- Do not!
That is the most embarrassing display I have ever seen.
You're absolutely right.
Anybody can see she's crazy about him.
Are you crazy?
He's nuts about her.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Excuse me.
I've got to powder my nose in the men's salon.
You look a little like Tip O'Neill.
Yeah?
You know, a lot of people say that.
But I'm better-looking than he is.
My God, you are Tip O'Neill!
How do you do?
I'm Sam Malone.
You used to throw for the Sox.
That's right.
What are you doing here?
I'm walking down the street and a lady stopped me.
Started to tell me her philosophy of life and government.
So I ducked in for a quick one.
What can I get you?
There you are!
Mr Speaker, forgive me for being relentless, but I want Diane, step into the office for a minute.
- What?
I'll be right back.
- No, she won't.
One more quick one, then I've really gotta run.
Norm, what were you saying about that do-nothing Congress in DC?
- They're a bunch of clowns.
- You think so?
Any average guy could do better.
- Nah.
- Sure.
This bozo could probably be a better Congressman.
I may run for office someday.
Yeah?
You do that.
You're out of work, too?
No, I'm Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Don't be ridiculous!
That'd make you Tip O'Neill, and me a horse's butt.
You said it, not me.
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!
What can I do for you?
I need something to kill time before my second beer.
- How about a first one?
- You got it.
Glad you came in today.
Big day.
- What's going on?
- The Miss Boston Barmaids contest.
- They pick the finalist.
- What is it?
What is it?
It's only the biggest event of the year.
Words can't describe it.
Waitresses serve drinks and one wins.
Yeah, that's about it.
Coach is particularly excited today.
This year, the contest is being held right here at Cheers.
Alright!
Is that right?
I hate to burst your bubble, but the contest's a phoney.
You gotta fool around with the judge to get in.
- That's disgusting!
- Yeah, and he won't return my calls.
Everybody, I want your attention.
They picked the finalists for the contest.
And this year, Cheers is gonna win.
Finally, they're letting in preggos!
No, Carla, it's not you.
It's Diane.
- Diane's pregnant?
- No, no.
She's a finalist, Coach.
Give me a copy!
That proves it.
There is no God.
She didn't say a word about it.
She doesn't know about it.
I entered her without telling her.
Why, Sam?
Just to cause me anguish?
Alright, she's not the best waitress in the world.
But she makes the other categories.
"Perky, pert, congenial and fun".
And I don't?
Sweetheart, you cannot join the contest.
You're pregnant.
So?
Proves I'm congenial.
- Good point.
- Sammy, here she comes.
I want this to be a surprise.
Pretend you don't know anything.
Coach, grab her apron.
Put it next to the paper so she sees it.
- Hello, everyone.
- Hi.
You all look chipper today.
What's up?
Come on!
I hate this.
- Tell me.
- Really, it's nothing at all.
Something in the paper?
"The Miss Boston Barmaid compet" I hate female contests with every fibre of my being.
Why did you want me to see this?
To make sure you felt the same way we did.
- Disgusting.
- Terrible.
What ninny would let herself be entered in a contest like that?
This kind.
- That's me!
- Takes guts to admit it.
Who did this?
Who is responsible for this?
I'll kill him!
- You did this.
- That's it.
Wong Song You.
He got killed in the Orient trying to rescue a nun.
That's him.
You entered me much as one would enter a heifer in a fair.
No.
Come on, Diane.
I mean, no.
The judges come in, secretly watch your work, and then pick the finalists.
In a county fair, you take the cow to the judges.
- Thanks a lot, Coach.
- Any time.
Come on, Diane.
I thought you'd be happy about this.
Of course.
I love being entered in degrading female contests.
Me, too, but I'm always pregnant.
Come on.
This is not degrading.
- In Boston, it's a very big honour.
- Yeah.
Di, it's really big, you know.
Not as big as Mail Carrier of the Year, but it's up there.
Mail Carrier of the Year?
Who do they give that to?
A postman or a pigeon?
- Watch your mouth.
- It was a joke.
Yeah?
Don't you ever, repeat, ever, joke about the US postal service in front of any mail carrier.
- Alright?
- He didn't mean anything by it.
I'd like to see how fat and sassy he'd be without his mail.
- I don't know what came over me.
- That's OK.
You had every right.
The Post Office is everybody's target.
But when they want a letter fast, who do they come to?
- Federal Express.
- He's mine!
Sit down!
These contests perpetuate the attitude that women are mere objects, to be judged and ranked according to how well they serve man.
Come on!
Lighten up, will you?
Relax a little bit.
This is not the UN.
Have some fun.
Do you think being scrutinised, poked and prodded like a side of beef is fun?
Not every day, but on your odd Saturday night What do you think I am?
Are you kidding?
I thought you were cute.
Is that such a big deal?
Cheers has never won this.
I thought might be nice if we did, if you won it for us.
I didn't think.
I picked up the picture and sent it in.
Where did you get it?
I Well, you know, I found it.
Found it where?
You were pretty careless.
I found it lying around in your wallet.
Don't go through my wallet again.
Don't worry.
It was boring.
Sorry.
If I'd known, I'd have added something interesting!
I never saw anyone with so many pictures of themselves.
With your cat, on your pony.
You by your car with your cat on your pony.
I'm going to call them, tell them what I think of this and that I won't do it.
Come on.
Damn.
Paul.
No hard feelings.
No.
The Sears catalogue came out this week.
It puts a strain on me.
I would like to speak to the person in charge of female dehumanisation.
What do you mean, "Speaking"?
This is in regard to the Miss Boston Barmaid competition.
I am Diane Chambers.
I have something to say about this contest.
And all contests like it.
I only wish the whole world could hear what I have to say.
There will be reporters there?
From all the major papers?
Well, I guess if a contestant had a few things to say, this would be an excellent forum for 'em.
Yes, I am every bit as cute as my picture.
Thank you.
I'll see you at the contest.
Diane.
I have one thing to say to you, and I mean this.
Stay in this contest, or we're no longer friends.
- I'm staying in the contest.
- Really?
- Yes.
- Diane!
You go to bed with me tonight, or we're no longer friends.
Well, I guess you can just push friendship so far.
Norm, hold this for me.
What smells great, Coach?
I just came from the barbershop.
They put on that zingy aftershave.
That explains why these flies are dying here.
Diane.
Listen, I've been to these things before.
I know what they want.
It's personality and customer service, but a nice appearance can't hurt, know what I mean?
- Sex?
- No, not sex, a nice appearance.
If you lowered your blouse off the shoulders Absolutely not!
Come on, just to check it out.
Come on.
That's very nice.
Maybe mess your hair up just a bit.
That's nice.
Lean against the bar.
Elbow up here, like that.
Wet your lips a little.
Pout.
That's good.
You said the judges weren't looking for sex.
They're not.
I am.
Just checked out the competition.
They look even better up close.
None of those girls have got what I'm looking for.
- What's that?
- Low standards.
Come clean.
One minute you're against this contest, the next you're all for it.
What's up?
You don't like this contest, do you?
It's a sham.
Carla, you'll be happy to hear that I am going to bring this contest to its knees.
I like it so far.
When they introduce me, I'm going to make a statement denouncing those responsible for this outrage.
I love it!
You know, there aren't many things about you that I like.
In fact, there is nothing about you that I like.
But I always say all great friendships start with one small act of vengeance.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome to the 45th annual Miss Boston Barmaid competition.
First, each contestant will tell us a little bit about herself.
Yvonne?
Hi, I'm Yvonne.
I go to modelling school.
I'd like to be an artist.
Hi, I'm Jocelyn.
I like being a waitress.
I'm saving my money to travel around the world next summer.
Hi, I'm Bonnie.
I have to say, I really like being just what I am, a cocktail waitress in the best city in the world.
Boston.
Go!
My name is Diane Chambers and I would like one day to be known as the voice of my generation.
You see, I'm a humanist Aren't we all?
Good luck.
lf you win, we'll be seeing you on AM Boston.
Just let AM Boston?
Right.
They'll be here later to tape the announcement of the winner.
Let the games begin!
Diane Chambers, humanist.
Now, Yvonne will wait on the judges, who'll ask will ask questions designed to help us get to know her better.
Hello, there.
I'm Yvonne.
I'll be serving you.
What's your pleasure, gentlemen?
Can you recommend something warm, sweet and perfect for the evening?
Irish coffee or me.
And one gin and tonic.
I am moved, Cliff.
I'm visibly moved.
- Gonna be tough to beat.
- Now for our last contestant.
From here at Cheers, Miss Diane Chambers.
Hello.
I'm Diane, I'm delighted to be your waitress.
- What can I get you?
- Screwdriver, please.
- What kind of vodka?
- Absolut.
Absolute-ly - Chivas rocks.
- I'll have a beer.
- Imported or domestic?
- What do you recommend?
I'll find something nice for you.
Back in a jiff, with pretzels.
You were terrific!
- Wait, you dropped some cards here.
- Never mind.
"Women pitted against each other in a display of servitude".
I don't know what it means, but it's making me hot.
- I'll take my speech, thank you.
- What do you mean, speech?
I'm going to win this contest so I can make a speech denouncing it.
Oh, my God!
Is that what you've been planning the whole time?
Sam, I have to do this.
I don't believe I could be so stupid.
I thought you might be a regular person for once.
- I am not a regular person.
- You're telling me!
Sam, someday, you will realise that I am doing the right thing.
Why do you always have to do the right thing?
Do you see the rest of us doing it?
We're happy.
- May I go now?
- Yeah, go on.
Help yourself.
By the way, just want to say, I'm glad that under all this pressure, we haven't seen that facial tic of yours.
And you won't.
Mind over matter.
St Pauli Girl.
Absolut screwdriver, Chivas rocks and pretzels.
Is there anything else that I can do for you?
Is there something wrong, miss?
- What do you mean?
- Are you alright?
Well, I have this facial tic.
But I I believe that all of us have obstacles to overcome in life.
And in the final analysis, the true measure of greatness is the severity of obstacles one has had to overcome in order to achieve one's goals.
I I may not be the most attractive waitress here, or the most talented, but I am a survivor.
I didn't come here to lose.
I came here to win.
I will beat them all.
I will beat any who come against me.
As God as my witness, I will never be hungry again!
Ladies and gentlemen, this year's Miss Boston Barmaid, Miss Diane Chambers!
Congratulations, Diane!
- Is that AM Boston?
- Yes, it is.
I really didn't expect to win this contest.
It has Thank you.
It has been quite It has been quite an experience.
Now, I would like to tell you my feelings about this contest.
But first, let me tell you what you've won.
- That's not necessary.
- Something every waitress needs.
Six months' worth of free dry cleaning at Ritz Cleaners!
Thank you.
Contests such as these do nothing And for entertaining at home, a Kitchen Helper food processor.
That's nice.
I've always wanted one.
Ladies and gentlemen A $200 gift certificate from Filene's Department Store, where you can buy some new outfits for that week-long vacation you and a friend will be taking to Bermuda!
Bermuda!
Oh, my God!
I sold out womankind for a trip to Bermuda.
Don't feel so bad.
Most people would do it for the dry cleaning.
Come on.
I don't even think you did sell out.
- Of course I did.
- No, you let your feelings out.
For the first time in your life, you were spontaneous.
It was great!
It's not the first time I've been spontaneous.
May I have my purse?
I enjoy being spontaneous, every now and then.
Whenever I think it's appropriate.
You're a maniac.
OK.
Maybe I do tend to be a little uptight at times.
Maybe this bar is changing me.
Maybe the atmosphere is rubbing off a little.
Maybe.
And maybe, in some small way, I'm the better for it.
Maybe you are.
Maybe I should thank you.
Maybe you should.
Like how?
Forget it.
Come on, you really want to make it up to me?
Let's go to Bermuda.
You got two tickets.
Don't be coy.
Alright, I know I've made a lot of passes at you.
But take me to Bermuda, I'll be the perfect gentleman.
- You will?
- Cross my heart.
Then forget it.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
You're in a pretty good mood tonight.
Why not?
I was up till two in the morning finishing off Kierkegaard.
I hope he thanked you for it.
I see Coach and George are still at it.
Yeah.
It's kind of fun.
They enjoy each other's company.
It's nice to have someone your own age to spend time with.
You've been through the same fads.
You don't have to explain things.
- There's a real comfort in that.
- Too bad we're not closer in age.
Isn't it?
However, six or seven years really isn't that much.
I would have thought eight or nine.
- I find older men stimulating.
- I hope you're not talking about me.
Certainly not.
You're not in the least bit stimulating.
Listen.
Seriously, I would not worry about your age.
You're obviously young enough to bring that Kierkegaard fellow home.
Do you two think that you could put your glands on hold long enough to get some work done here?
You win again, George.
I just had all the cards today, Coach.
You'll get me tomorrow.
You bet I will.
Take it easy, pal.
Always do.
See you, pal.
See you, folks.
- Take care.
- Bye.
Sam, can I borrow You bet.
- Boy, was that George hot!
- I didn't know you played for money.
Every day for months.
- How many games have you won?
- If I had to guess, let me see None.
None?
Sam, I've been right in there every game.
- Coach, that guy's a hustler.
- George and me, we're like pals.
That's how they operate.
Trust me.
- We're only playing for fun.
- How much fun have you lost?
- About eight grand.
- Eight grand?
That's spread over since last February.
Don't you see what he's doing?
He's taking you for everything you got.
I can't believe it.
Sam, you are at least six or seven years older than I am.
Admit it.
Wait a second.
We just discovered George has been hustling Coach for a lot of money.
George?
That sweet, white-haired gentleman?
- Piffle.
- No, Diane, it's true.
Sam, isn't there anything we can do about it?
I got it.
We beat him up, strip him, take his money and put him on a bus.
- Subtle, Carla.
- That's how I got to Boston.
I just had the worst idea I've ever had.
- Worse than hiring her?
- The second worst idea.
Remember Harry?
Maybe he could help us out here.
You mean that hustler you're always throwing out?
That's like calling Spinoza to settle an argument between Nietzsche and Schopenhauer.
She's got a point there, Sam.
Look, I think it's a mistake to trust Harry.
George is a con men.
Harry's a con man.
What's the old saying?
- "Send a thief " - "To camp for the summer.
" I don't even know where to find him.
I know exactly where he is.
In jail, like he always is.
You sure?
In Boston, for the city jail.
Sure you don't mind me doing this?
No, go ahead.
I use Information to get numbers all the time.
Coach.
- Hi, Harry.
- Harry ..
Here's the 10 bucks I'm gonna owe you in about five minutes.
Thanks.
Coach, where's Sam?
- He'll be out in a minute.
- Wanna play for a drink?
Not a chance, Harry.
No way.
Don't show fear.
He smells fear.
Cliff.
You feel lucky?
- Sure.
Why?
- Tell you what.
I'll bet you a dime I can drink that drink without touching the hat.
A dime?
- OK.
You're on.
- You'll love this.
It's gone.
What's so good about that?
Anybody can do that.
I can do that.
- No.
- A dime?
Coach, another shot, please.
A dime says I can drink the old shot without touching the old chapeau.
Are you ready?
I'll be right back.
OK, that baby's gone.
That's great, Cliff.
That's worth a dime.
You can laugh, but at least I got my money back.
Five bucks for the booze, Cliffo.
- Thanks, Cliff.
- Any time, Harry.
What's the matter?
If you gave as much to the space programme as you have to him, we'd have condos on Venus.
Thank you for coming.
Can I get you a drink?
- For free is too easy.
- Let's go sit down over there.
Coach, you wanna join us?
Carla, you got the bar?
She always gets to watch the bar.
- Diane, you may have the bar.
- Goody.
Diane has the bar.
- Yes?
- I need a Bloody Mary.
A Bloody Mary coming up.
Where do we keep the Mary?
"The Bartender's Guide.
" "The Bloody Mary.
" "There's nothing like a fresh Bloody Mary to start any day.
" "A traditional favourite served with lunch, brunch, and often as the 'hair of the dog that bit you'".
- "Its name derives from " - Make the drink!
That's Eddie the Mole from Phoenix.
They call him Mole Man, or Moley.
- In Philly they call him Sid.
- Sid?
Philly's a dull town.
So, what you're saying is he's pretty well-known?
Any bird-dogger knows him.
He runs paper and cubes, mainly in the crib, sometimes up against the wall.
Puts on a straight-up-guy front, and then grinds away slow with coolers and hop toads, real rip and tear kind of stuff.
Yeah.
That sounds like him.
It seems to me he got in trouble with the boys in Vegas last year.
He's been keeping a low profile.
Could be him.
A lot of those guys lay low by making small money off dumb saps.
So where do I come in?
Sam, excuse me.
Where do you keep the measuring spoons?
- We don't have any.
- What?
"Precise measurements are one of the keys to a good drink.
" Page 12.
Serving it the same day it's ordered is right up there, too.
Carla, Girls, please.
C'mon, Harry.
You got anything?
You got any ideas?
I think you need a poker game.
The Mole is not known for poker.
Call him and tell him you have a little game going here at closing.
That makes you the roper.
You bring him into the game.
How do we know that he brings enough money to cover Coach's losses?
The guys always carry a big roll.
They gotta be ready for action.
You have to promote this as a friendly neighbourhood game.
- You're the inside man.
- With you so far.
- I'm gonna need a bankroll.
- You just lost me.
Sam, if you don't stake me, it doesn't go down.
- I need about five grand.
- Five grand?
Are you kidding me?
This whole thing's getting out of hand.
Sam, please.
Alright.
I'll be the What d'you call the guy who brings the money?
You call him the guy who brings the money.
One other thing, Sam.
- I appreciate this.
- I appreciate getting bailed out.
Besides, I don't like the idea of somebody else plucking my pigeons.
See ya.
Thanks, Sam.
"A dash of pepper.
" A lot of ingredients in a Bloody Mary.
That's why we usually mix up five gallons and put it in the fridge.
Carla, why'd you let her do it?
I wanted to see her try and make vodka.
- Closing time.
- Sammy, let me get this straight.
Whatever we lose, we're gonna get back.
- That's right.
- Great.
I love to gamble without risk.
Sam, would you mind if I stay and watch?
I promise I won't ask a bunch of dumb questions.
- You won't even know I'm here.
- OK.
So, why poker?
Why not crazy eights or chess?
Why don't I shut up like I said I would?
I always get this way when I'm nervous.
What can I do to stop?
I know what to do with hiccups, but with runaway chattering Hello, everyone.
Hi, George.
I understand you fellas have a little poker game going tonight?
We get together every once in a while.
Coach thought you might like to sit in.
I haven't played poker in years.
I just hope I don't embarrass myself.
Embarrass yourself?
You're playing poker with guys who can't bet and chew gum at the same time.
We got an extra chair in here, Harry, if you wanna sit in.
Me?
Well, I've heard that poker can be a pleasant diversion, if it doesn't get too intense.
- Aren't you playing, Coach?
- Not me, George.
Gin's my game.
OK.
Minimum buy-in's $500.
Let's see some money, gentlemen.
You're pretty good.
- Lucky tonight.
- Yeah, real lucky, huh, Harry?
Your bet, Cliff.
I'll see that 50 and I'll raise you Let's see.
I'll raise you You can't bet stamps.
I'll fold, then.
- Up to you, Norm.
- The Lord hates a coward.
I'll see the 50 and raise $300.
- You're bluffing.
- You're right.
I'm out.
I'll raise 500.
Too rich for my blood.
I'm calling you, George.
Looks like it's my night, boys.
Harry, maybe we ought to get out of the game.
- What for?
- No reason.
You lost most of the money I put in, George has got all the cards, and you're playing lousy.
Everything's fine.
I'm toying with him.
I'm giving him a false sense of security.
You're giving him a genuine sense of security.
Fellas, let's play cards.
Straight to the jack.
Damn.
- What the hell happened?
- I lost.
No kidding.
You lost everything I put in.
Why didn't you cheat?
That was the whole point.
I ran every gaff I know and he beat me.
I don't know what to say to you except I'm sorry.
I'm going to wash up.
Ladies and gentlemen, it's been a pleasure.
Sam, could I ask you a question?
Does four of a kind beat a straight?
Of course.
Then why did Harry throw in these four threes?
- Look what time it's getting to be.
- George, hang on a second.
- What's going on here?
- I'm just going home.
Maybe not.
You and Harry concocted this whole deal this afternoon, right?
Are you gonna go outside and split the winnings?
Of course not.
Then you wouldn't mind if we just take our money back.
Try anything and I'll tell the police about this poker game.
You could lose your liquor licence.
You've done this before.
You made a fool out of me, and you can keep my money.
I just want my friends to get their money back, every penny.
You understand?
I'm not giving you any of my money back, Coach.
- What if we cut up Harry's share?
- That's not such a bad idea.
You could play him again, beat him, and give us our money back.
I never did like the guy.
- I'll challenge him to another game.
- You think you can beat him?
Of course I can.
I can have three queens in my hand at any time.
All I need to know is when he can't beat that.
You mean like a sign?
Please let me give the sign.
All this trouble's on account of me.
Please let me give the sign.
I don't know.
It's tricky, isn't it?
He is the last person Harry would figure being in on anything clever.
Just don't screw it up.
Come here, Coach.
Give your sign the first time Harry can't beat three queens.
- What's the sign?
- Let me see.
I'll rub my nose like this.
It's the old bunt sign.
Got it.
OK, good night, everybody.
- George, you need a ride downtown?
- They're onto us, Harry.
- Onto what?
- They figured out our little prank.
Come on, Sam.
Times are hard.
A guy's gotta do what he can.
Harry, I was never much of a team player, especially with Boston small-timers.
Why don't you and me play a little one-on-one for the whole jackpot.
You know, Mole, I was never too impressed by Arizona hustlers, except they got good sinuses.
You're on.
- Mind if I deal?
- No.
- What's the game?
- Five-card draw, no limit.
- Here's your half.
- Fine.
- Ante's a yard.
- What?
$100.
Pay attention.
I'll bet two.
It's covered.
What do you need?
One.
Dealer takes one.
George, did you see that?
Yes, I did, Coach.
I scratched my nose because it was itchy.
- Right.
I saw you do that.
- It was really itchy, George.
- That's why you scratched it.
- Exactly.
Stimulating conversation.
We playing cards or what?
- It's George's bet.
- Harry, let's stop fooling around.
I'm going into my private stash.
Ten grand.
I like those socks.
Covered.
Three little ladies.
- Four threes?
- That can't be.
Seeing is believing, Mole.
- Why did you make the bet?
- Because you scratched your nose.
But I told you why I scratched my nose.
That does it.
I never wanna see you come through that door again.
Don't worry, Malone, you won't.
You caused me to lose a fortune, you old fool.
You're a stupid, blundering moron who deserves to lose his money.
What a night.
I don't believe the whole thing happened.
I feel so used.
What are you doing?
Sammy, I think he's snapped.
He's laughing.
- What are you laughing at?
- That.
One born every minute.
We did it, Harry.
There's your money.
Who wants to play double or nothing?
You had George conned that you two were working together while it was you and Coach?
- You're not even close.
- Yeah, he is.
That's it exactly.
Come on, everybody, coffee's on me.
So only you and Coach knew about this?
Why didn't you let us in on it?
I didn't think you were bright enough to pull it off.
I still don't like you.
You feeling lucky tonight?
What you got in mind?
A game of chance, simple cut of the cards.
What are the stakes?
If I win, I get to go to bed with you.
- What if I win?
- You get to go to bed with me.
Forget it.
I understand.
You'd rather earn it.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Goodnight, Dan.
Be careful going home now.
Boy, that guy sure chewed your ear off, Coach.
Yeah, but what a nice guy.
You know something?
That's the first person I ever met that was on the Titanic.
- He survived the Titanic?
- I forgot to ask.
I would've loved to hear that story.
I figured you'd heard it.
Big boat, hit an iceberg.
Bang!
Down it went.
Any interesting stories, call me.
It's one of the joys of bartending.
You want interesting?
Forget the Titanic.
Come here.
Glen, tell him what you told me earlier.
Go ahead.
I know all the words to the Bonanza theme song.
Go ahead.
Let him hear it.
We got a right To pick a little fight, Bonanza!
If anyone fights any one of us He's gotta fight with me We're not a one To settle up and run, Bonanza!
Any one of us starts a little fight Knows he can trust on me One for four, four for one, This we guarantee One for four, four for one - Howdy, sports fans.
- Norm!
- What'll it be, Norm?
- Fame, fortune, fast women.
Yeah?
How about a beer?
Even better.
How's the search for work, Norm?
Good news, everybody.
I'm no longer looking for a job.
I'm now begging for one.
- I don't believe this.
- What now?
That was my mother.
She just flew into town and she's coming here.
No kidding.
We finally get to meet her.
- This is very strange.
- That you have a mother?
No.
That you have a mother that wants to see you?
No.
That she's coming over here.
I didn't think Mommy'd be caught dead in a place like this.
What are we, too grungy or something?
Yeah, inside an hour ago, I'm in the tub.
You're taking this too personally.
You shouldn't.
- It's just Mommy doesn't like bars.
- Bars can be very sad places.
Some people spend their whole lives in a bar.
Just yesterday, some guy sat right here next to me for 11 hours.
- What kind of a life is that?
- Pitiful.
The sad thing is, he'll be sitting in a bar right now, drinking a beer, going on and on about nothing.
Diane, if your mom is anything like you, everyone will love her.
She's nothing like I am.
She's very eccentric and a little hard to take at times.
Yeah, worlds apart.
Diane, if your mother's so rich, how come you're not?
I didn't want to go through life being handed money on a silver tray.
For you.
Thank you.
There she is.
My little baby.
Mommy.
Hello, darling.
They didn't get near each other.
How can anyone miss Diane's mouth?
So, this is a bar.
Yes.
This is where I work.
Let me introduce you.
Mother, this is Sam, who wouldn't say anything to embarrass me, so wisely says nothing.
How do you do?
Hi.
This is Carla Tortelli.
She says even less than Sam and she's very busy.
Down there we have Norman and his friend Cliff.
They lost their tongues in the war.
Ernie Pantusso.
You can call him Coach.
- Or use my other nickname, Red.
- Red?
As a player, his team-mates called him Red.
Because your hair was red?
No, ma'am.
Because I read a book.
He's very sweet though.
Very sweet.
It's nice to finally meet you, Mrs Chambers.
It's nice to meet you, Sam.
Diane's told me about you.
You're almost as handsome as she says you think you are.
There's a compliment in there someplace.
It's very nice of you to come all this way.
I thought so, too, but you know what tomorrow is?
- No.
What?
- Your wedding day.
Congratulations.
My what?
If you're not married before tomorrow, I lose my share of your father's estate.
My God!
Why?
Darling, when he died, you were still a little gawky girl, with your nose in a book and a terrible facial tic.
Your father was worried that you would never find a mate, and that you would have a lonely life.
So he made me promise that I would have you married ten years after the day he died.
He even put it in his will.
So, if you're still single, I'm cut off.
Why have you waited to tell me?
Father's been dead ten years.
You know how time flies when you're having - Grief.
- Grief.
So, if I'm not married by tomorrow, you're broke?
Put your mind at ease.
I'll never be broke.
I'll either be rich or dead.
The choice is yours.
You're seriously asking me to get married?
My attorneys have assured me that it need be in name only, just for a few days.
There's no other way.
This is the craziest thing Father ever did.
Not even close, dear.
Excuse me, madam.
I dropped the bags off at the hotel.
- Thank you.
- Nice to see you, Boggs.
I'd be honoured if you'd consent to be my wife.
I said "in a pinch", Boggs.
- Now wait over there.
- Yes, madam.
Darling, think hard.
There's so little time.
Don't you know anyone who'd be willing to marry you for a few days?
Well, I'm afraid there's no one I'm steadily dating at the moment.
Excuse me, ..
rich lady.
I couldn't help overhearing your problems.
Your daughter has a hot thing for the bartender.
I do not!
She likes Red?
He's dumb enough to be your father.
Not him.
Sam.
I care nothing.
I feel nothing.
Sam who?
Come off it.
We've all noticed how you two go around, looking at each other like lovesick cows.
Admit it.
He's got you steaming under the silks.
- This happens to be my mother.
- That's why I'm being delicate.
Diane, is this true?
How about the two of you?
I'd rather marry Boggs.
I could make you very happy.
Sorry, Boggs.
Just a figure of speech.
Thank you, miss.
Diane, he's not a bad-looking fellow.
His cologne's an affront to society but what harm would it do to ask?
Mother, no.
Darling, please.
I wish I was as strong as you are, but I'm not.
Without money, I don't think I can make it.
Alright, I'll ask him.
Sam?
- What?
- May I speak with you a moment?
- I might as well come to the point.
- That'd be nice.
Would you be willing to marry me?
Boy, this cologne must be doing its stuff.
You see, my very eccentric father put a very strange clause into his will.
Providing that if I'm not married by tomorrow, my mother will become destitute.
So, if we could get married, just long enough to satisfy the attorneys, it would really help her out and I would consider it a favour.
I'd consider it a joke.
Marriage and me do not mix.
No, it's not marriage.
It's a business arrangement.
Just for a couple of days and then we'll get divorced.
Listen, I've been married before.
You haven't.
Take my word, marriage changes people.
No woman in the world can hear those words and not start believing it.
That's a very sexist thing to say.
No, it's not sexist because no man can resist it either.
Why, Sam, that's a very romantic thing to say.
The difference is, with men, they get over it in an hour.
With women, it goes on for years.
If you're worried about me, I'm only doing this for my mother.
Yeah, right.
I promise you that I will not feel any emotions toward you.
I learned a long time ago never to trust anybody wearing a wedding gown, especially a woman.
Forget I asked.
- I'm sorry.
- Never mind.
I'm sorry, Mommy.
He said no.
Oh, dear.
Hell.
- OK, Diane.
- OK what?
OK, we'll get married.
- Really?
- Yeah.
You bet.
Mr Malone, how wonderful.
You're both wonderful.
Thank you very much.
I'm still rich.
I'll get the Justice.
Come along, Boggs.
- Thanks for changing your mind.
- You're welcome.
I wanted to help.
- What you're doing is very noble.
- Thank you.
Where do you want to go on our honeymoon?
I should've known.
As usual, Mr Malone has his brains caught in his zipper.
Is this the first wedding in Cheers?
No, Frankie Flaherty got married in this bar.
He met Janet in that corner, proposed to her here, right in front of me, they married there, had their first fight by the piano, she caught him in the poolroom with a woman, shot him dead in the alley.
That's an incredible story.
- Want to know where he's buried?
- Where?
He ain't.
He's cremated.
- Thank God!
- Here's his ashes.
- We've got the licence.
- What took you so long?
While I was there, I paid my water bill and registered my bicycle.
Know what they ask for a bicycle licence?
- Sam, shut up.
- Sorry, dear.
I'd like to introduce you to Mr Harrison Fiedler, Justice of the Peace, who will perform the ceremony.
- Hi, Just.
- We need witnesses.
Yep.
Every accident needs some witnesses.
Sammy, please, I'd be proud to be your best man.
I'm honoured.
Thank you.
The day Diane walked in, I knew you'd get together.
Coach, this is just temporary.
I knew that, too.
How come you never got married?
Well, Norm, Coach, it's unfair to ask a woman to be the wife of a mailman.
Watching him get up every morning, strapping on that mailbag, hitting those mean streets, never knowing if he's coming back or not.
Right.
Somewhere out there is a beagle with your name on it.
Excuse me.
I think we should begin.
Are you ready, Mr Fiedler?
I'm ready.
May I have the licence?
The groom's name is Schwinn?
That's my bicycle licence.
Excuse me.
Diane, do you think we could we lose the aprons?
The aprons.
Carla, the apron.
Gee, I didn't know it was going to be this formal.
- Are you OK?
- Fine.
Just a business arrangement.
I do appreciate it for Mommy's sake.
You're welcome.
Just remember, no emotions.
If I feel anything romantic, I will run screaming from the room.
And I will clear a path for you.
Would the bride and groom come forward, please?
We are gathered in the presence of these witnesses for the purpose of uniting in matrimony Diane Chambers and Sam Malone.
The contract of marriage is most solemn and not to be entered into lightly, but thoughtfully and seriously and with a deep realisation of its obligations and responsibilities.
Any two people who have come to this point clearly feel the love and joy that they find in one another can surmount whatever obstacles lie in their path.
Sam, do you take?
Do you mind?
What?
Never mind.
I'm sorry, please go on.
- Sam, do you take this woman - What did I do?
I saw the leer.
- Leer?
Come on, Diane.
- Please.
Please go on.
Sam, do you take this woman to be your lawful?
She's a customer in my bar.
I smiled, that's all.
Go on.
She's a woman.
Well, I'll be darned, so she is.
To have and to hold from this time forward - It was just a look.
- Just a look?
This is just a look.
This is what you did.
Can we get on with the ceremony?
- To have and to hold - Wait a minute.
What's the big deal?
You're beginning to sound like my wife.
Excuse me.
We are getting married.
I may not be asking for 50 years of love, honour and obey, but it would be nice if, during the ceremony, you didn't drool.
You really are demanding.
I don't understand why you're trying to make me so crazy.
I don't understand why you chose now to demonstrate your lack of class.
I'm the one doing you the favour.
- Don't do me any favours.
- Children, please.
Butt out, Mom.
This is the stupidest thing I ever did.
Stupidest thing?
There is no stupidest thing you ever did.
Everything you do is equally stupid.
Including not throwing you out when I saw your stupid face!
- Sam, do you have the ring?
- Shut up!
That's it.
We're making a mockery of marriage and it's all my fault.
There'll be no wedding here today.
Fine.
- I hate your guts and I always will.
- That goes double for me.
I understand they wrote their own vows.
You know, 30 minutes ago, I was a wealthy woman.
- Now I can't pay for these drinks.
- Don't worry.
The drinks are on me.
I don't want your charity and I don't want your pity, but I will take your money.
Well, if it hadn't been for dear old Dad and his strange clause in the will, you would never have been in this predicament.
You mustn't think ill of your father.
He was concerned.
He loved you very much.
You know that, don't you?
- Yes, I guess I do.
- In a strange way, he loved me, too.
Unfortunately, he loved a good joke more.
Spencer, wherever you are tonight, I hope you're frying.
You two are still here?
We'll lock up.
How are you getting home?
How are we getting home, Mommy?
Boggs is waiting outside to drive us.
I'm sorry about this afternoon.
I'm sorry, too.
I told you, weddings do weird things to me.
I must admit, I got a little swept away myself.
I think I owe you an apology, too, Mrs Chambers.
I'm sorry.
What I asked you to do was unfair.
Are you alright?
Actually, I I'm really quite afraid.
Afraid of what, Mommy?
I'm afraid of being poor.
I was poor before I met your father, and it took me years to really forget how being poor felt.
Excuse me, madam.
Could I have a word?
- What is it, Boggs?
- I heard of your tragedy.
I'd be honoured if you'd consent to be my wife.
- It's too late for that.
- No.
I meant you, madam.
Why, Boggs, have you lost your mind?
I mean, I've only accepted your familiarity over the years because I was afraid of class warfare.
I am aware of that.
However, in view of the developments in the last half an hour, our stations have, shall we say, grown a little closer.
Now, then, Boggs Madam, it so happens, I have a considerable sum of money stashed away.
Really?
- Where did you get it, Boggs?
- From you and yours, madam.
I've been embezzling from your family for close to a quarter of a century.
Why, Boggs, how clever of you.
Exactly how much money do you have?
As I recall my Emily Post, a lady does not ask her chauffeur how much he stole from her dead husband.
Let us just say, I am very comfortable.
Shall we go to dinner and talk about the future?
Bon appétit.
You know, Boggs, I must confess, I've always found the back of your head enormously attractive.
I sensed it, madam.
Would you do me a favour, madam?
- What's that?
- Would you drive?
Kinky.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Sam, let me have the TV control.
- What are you gonna watch?
- Something extraordinary on TV.
- What's up.
Game on?
- What is it, the Bruins?
I think the lady singing the anthem is loaded.
Diane, what the hell is this?
Wagner's "Ring of the Nibelungs", the complete cycle.
"Das Rheingold", "Die Walküre", "Siegfried" and finally "Götterdämmerung".
I hope they don't use that canned laughter.
It's not comedy.
This is opera.
I'll explain as we proceed.
This is the story of a golden ring with magical powers that curses anyone who owns it.
Wait.
They had that same story on Scooby Doo Saturday morning.
But the dog sang a little better than that.
Come on, you guys.
Give it a chance.
The first three hours are I put up with your sporting events.
It's time that you return the favour.
After ten minutes, if you aren't totally mesmerised by its beauty, - I will turn it off.
- Ten minutes?
Very funny.
Culture's wasted on you.
Oxygen is wasted on you.
That was not a very nice thing to do to Diane.
- Sam's got a point there.
- She has watched a lot of sports.
Let's give it another shot.
Coach, I'm gonna be in the back checking the wine.
OK, Sam.
Would you like to join me?
It's quiet, empty, dimly lit.
Much like your mind.
So, what do you say?
Sam, you talk a lot about our having a dalliance, but I've always been told that barking dogs don't bite.
Biting.
Is that what you're into?
Do you know what bothers me?
There are women upon whom this works, and they're allowed to vote and drive cars.
So, what do you say?
Fred and Ginger are taking a break, but they'll be back to nauseate you later on.
Eddie, it's been nice talking to you.
By the way, did I tell you that my wife passed away some time ago?
Yeah.
Thanks.
I really appreciate that.
Is your wife dead yet, Ed?
That's good.
I wanna thank you for thinking about me, and I'll get back to you.
So long, pal.
What is it?
Pal of mine, Eddie Fuentes, manages in the Winter Leagues in Venezuela.
He says if I can learn Spanish, he might have a job for me, coaching.
You mean you're gonna return to coaching?
Yeah, baseball's so much simpler than life.
In baseball I always know where I'm at.
We're up, I'm in the coach's box.
They're up, I'm in the dugout.
The game is over, I hit the head, get a cheeseburger.
- Sounds like a great life.
- It's terrific.
You know any Spanish, Coach?
I took some courses for a couple of days just to learn a few phrases.
Like what?
Like, "How tall is my dentist"?
and "Is that really your sister"?
Just enough to get by.
- You're gonna do fine, Coach.
- Thanks, Cliff.
Interesting.
That was Sam's brother.
He's on his way over.
- Brother?
Didn't know he had one.
- Me either.
- He didn't tell any of you?
- Coach?
Si?
- Did you know Sam has a brother?
- Of course I know he had a brother.
- He hates him.
- Why does he hate him?
He was cruel to him.
When Sam was a kid, he'd shove his head underwater.
Wait a minute.
That was my brother.
Come to think of it, that was my head.
Don't Sam and his brother spend any time together?
They get together whenever he's in town, but he's never been to Cheers.
He's coming now, and someone has to tell Sam.
Let me do it.
I'm a smoothie about breaking bad news.
- Your apartment burned down.
- My God.
Really?
No.
Your brother's on his way over.
Makes you feel better, doesn't it?
- I hate it when you do that.
- It cushions the blow.
- My brother's in town?
- I took the call.
- He was just leaving his hotel.
- Good.
Did you tell him I was here?
Of course.
I had no idea this would be a problem.
No problem.
My brother's coming over.
I love my brother.
That's not what I heard.
Step in here and let me show you something I've triumphed over.
Don't tell me you've finally mastered the stapler.
Sit down.
What they were talking about out there is I used to have this problem with my brother, Derek.
It was kind of an inferiority complex.
But that was a long time ago, and I conquered it.
Here it is.
This is the guy that used to make me feel like nothing.
What?
He's very nice-looking.
He'd be even better if he had his two front teeth.
I blacked those out myself.
That was before I got over my problem.
I didn't go to any psychiatrists.
I didn't read any fancy books.
I just sat myself down and said, "My brother's no better than I am.
" I'm sure you're right.
- What's he do for a living?
- He's an international lawyer.
It so happens I come from a very intelligent family.
I guess Derek does OK for himself.
He must make 50, 50 grand a year.
You're kidding.
Those guys make 10 times that much.
It's the job.
Last year he travelled so much, he had to buy his own plane.
What kind of life is that?
The poor wretch.
Who am I kidding?
The guy is better at everything than I am.
He's perfect.
Sam.
He's maybe a man of some accomplishment, but this all sounds like a younger brother idealising his older sibling.
- You think so?
- Sure.
He's just an ordinary Joe.
Can I keep this?
You must have a sense of humour about these things.
Maybe you're right.
If I looked at it right, it could be funny.
- Sure.
- One less tooth and a moustache.
Sam, nuclear bomb just hit Boston.
Derek's here.
They're catching on.
Listen.
Wait.
I don't want you to worry about me.
I'm used to living around Mr Wonderful all my life.
It's no big deal.
It's just that when he's in the room, I feel invisible.
Sam, I don't pay you a lot of compliments, but I really don't feel you have any need to feel inferior to anyone.
Thank you.
That's very nice.
- Nice voice.
Who is that?
- Guess.
Way to go, Derek.
- Can we get this man a beer?
- I'll get it.
Sam, sorry, I didn't see you.
Derek, how about a beer?
No, thank you, Norm.
What a guy.
Can I catch a beer, Sammy?
- Where are my waitresses?
- Watching the show.
- The show?
- Derek's doing trick pool shots.
Must have had fun growing up with him.
Do you have any idea what kind of gift I could get for Derek?
- Gift?
- I feel I should get him something.
He did get me a job.
He got you a job, after all those months you're been looking?
Not just a job.
He got me a great job.
For the first time I'm gonna have my own parking space.
Got a secretary, a window for water bombs, all the perks.
- Good for you, Norm.
That's great.
- So what can I get him?
I really don't care what you get him.
Get him a tie.
Sure.
I wouldn't dare buy clothes for that guy.
He has his lint made in England.
Norm, hurry up.
He's gonna do some tap-dancing for us.
You two, come on back here.
We got a rich guy tap-dancing.
Sammy.
Your brother is one good-looking guy.
Did you ever hear Derek say anything about being a sucker for swarthy, fertile, Mediterranean types?
- Afraid not, Carla.
- Figured.
Let me have a couple of Heinekens and a couple of Löwenbräus.
How come your brother has beautiful curly blond hair and deep blue eyes?
- Are they blue?
- Like Windex.
Boy, sounds like the stick lady's having a good time, doesn't it?
Is that Diane's laugh?
I thought they were killing chickens back there.
He really got to her when he told her about that time in Paris when he got drunk with Anais Nin.
Really?
I was hoping you'd know.
Derek's always been like that, always had to have the spotlight, had to be the centre of attention.
If it's any consolation to you, I know how you feel.
I got a sister who's got me beat in every way.
She's five foot two, her husband never has a drink until noon, and she's a beautician.
How do you compete with that?
But after a while I said to myself, "To hell with her.
I'm me.
" What you're trying to say is I'm as good as my brother?
You're kidding?
You're not even as good as my sister.
But I still like you best, Sam.
That makes two of us.
Wait a minute.
What do you think?
You think Diane likes Derek?
"Does Diane like Derek"?
I don't know.
I'll pass her a note in gym.
I know what my brother's like around women, and I know Diane.
You know something?
I used to admire you.
But know what's happened to you since she got here?
You've turned into a big weenie.
You're a dink, a wimp, a fred, a loser.
Thank you.
I was having a confidence problem, but that's been a real boost.
Just a few weeks ago, you were making time with every foxy lady in Boston, on your way to legendary status.
You were heading for the Hounds Hall of Fame.
Then Lady Fishface walked in the door.
- What's going on here?
- I don't know.
It's driving me nuts.
Maybe she's playing hard-to-get, but hard-to-get for me used to mean I'd have to sit through dinner.
If you can't get to her, no one can.
- What about Derek?
- In a minute.
But don't worry.
He's got better taste than that.
- What?
- Your brother's teaching me Spanish.
You're learning the Spanish language in one evening?
You want me to take the bar over?
I get it.
You'd rather be here when he's back there, right?
- Something like that.
- You don't have to draw me pictures.
Although I like it, but you don't have to.
- What's your order?
- Sam, he's not that great.
He can tell an interesting story, he's met a few interesting people, but he's just a man like any other man you'd meet in Greek mythology.
- What's your order?
- I don't have an order.
I thought you'd like to join the party.
I'll take the bar.
Go back there and enjoy yourself.
Believe it or not, I'm having a lot of fun just being out here by myself.
I swear, it does not bother me that my brother's here.
- Really?
- Really.
Good.
I feel better telling you about something.
Derek wants a beer.
I'm buying.
I'm taking care of this.
I'm buying.
Sam, I love this bar of yours.
But you know the best thing about it?
Its owner.
- Thanks, Sam.
- Derek, one more game of pool.
You were about to tell me something.
Derek just wants to fly me out to Martha's Vineyard tonight.
In a plane or on his back?
He didn't say, specifically.
Of course, he was all excited about the new Learjet he just bought.
- But it's not a date or anything.
- What if it is?
It's OK with me.
- I thought maybe you'd be bothered.
- Bothered?
I have a date myself tonight.
It's a good night for it.
OK.
If you're sure.
I think you and Derek will make a great match.
Really?
You both think you're perfect, and one of you is right.
You know what your problem is?
You are afraid of your feelings.
I am not.
I don't have any feelings about this.
Whatever you and my brother Derek want to do is OK with me.
I don't care.
- Fine.
- Please don't go.
What?
What did you say?
I said I have no feelings about this.
No, after that.
You said something.
It sounded like "Please don't go.
" Please don't go?
Are you crazy?
You gotta get over this egotism of yours.
Go, with my blessings.
Have a good time, really.
Please stay here.
Wait a minute.
What was that?
There at the end you said something.
You're hallucinating.
Get outta here and have a good time.
Go on.
OK, I'm glad you understand.
- If you go, I'll die.
- What?
- I heard you say something.
- You're coming unglued.
Please go.
Have fun.
- OK, I'll go.
- There you go.
If you'll excuse me, I'm going to go freshen up.
- I'd rather stay with you.
- What?
What did you say?
I didn't hear anything.
What do you say we go to the Combat Zone and see a girlie show?
I've got a date, Coach.
Maybe I'll go alone.
It's a tough neighbourhood.
I think you need some protection.
You're right, Sam.
What do you say, Carla?
- Not tonight, Coach.
- Maybe some other time.
Good night.
- See you tomorrow, Sam.
- Yeah.
Want me to hang around till your date gets here?
- You probably wanna get on home.
- Are you kidding?
It's 2am.
My kids might be there.
Sammy, would you just tell me one thing?
What do you see in her?
Who?
The one who was off on a Learjet with your brother.
The one who can't stop talking.
The geek.
I know she's not perfect.
I know she talks too much.
She's all those things you said.
But there are times when I'm with her she just irritates the hell out of me.
- That's what you're looking for?
- Maybe it is.
I know what you mean.
I'm always falling for guys I hate.
My whole life has been the wrong man at the wrong time in the wrong place with the wrong birth-control device.
Sam?
You ever thought, even for a minute, about you and me?
Sure I have, Carla.
A recent minute?
I was always afraid you'd be too much woman for me.
You're a wise man, Sam Malone.
- Hi, Sam.
- Hi, Debbie.
Boy am I glad you could make it tonight.
It really isn't very fair to call me at the last minute like that.
It's a good thing my boyfriend's a heavy sleeper.
I just didn't feel like being alone tonight.
- What do you want to do?
- Something with just the two of us.
I don't wanna think about anything or anybody but us all night long.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
So, Chuck, how's the job search going?
I got something, but I'm not too excited.
I'm a janitor in a biology lab where they do DNA experiments, making mutant viruses.
That sounds like a pretty good job.
Makes me nervous, weird stuff floating around.
- Don't worry.
I'm sure it's safe.
- Absolutely.
They take all the right precautions.
I guess you're right.
Must be getting a little paranoid.
I feel better already.
See you later.
Take care, Chuck.
Last week on Cheers Interesting.
That was Sam's brother.
He's on his way over.
He hates him.
The guy is better at everything than I am.
He's perfect.
- Nice voice.
Who is that?
- Guess.
Your brother is one good-looking guy.
The guy did get me a job.
Hurry up.
He's gonna do some tap-dancing for us.
He's teaching me Spanish.
- You think Diane likes Derek?
- I'll pass her a note in gym.
He's just a man, like any other man you'd meet in Greek mythology.
Derek just wants to fly me out to Martha's Vineyard tonight.
In a plane or on his back?
Whatever you and my brother Derek wanna do is OK with me.
I don't care.
- I'd rather stay with you.
- What?
What did you say?
I didn't hear anything.
Is Diane about to fall for Sam's brother?
Will Sam's heart be broken?
Will Norm find happiness in his new job?
Will Coach return to coaching in Venezuela?
Will Carl Yastremski please call Cheers and ask for the Spitfire?
Well, Coach, it's just clear we've reached a philosophical impasse.
Much like the question of the tree falling in the woods.
The what?
The tree falling in the woods.
If a tree falls in the woods and there's nobody there to hear it, does it make a sound?
If there's nobody there, how do you know it fell?
- We assume that it fell.
- But you don't know.
OK, I went into the woods yesterday and saw the tree lying on the ground.
Beavers could have chewed on it and gently lowered it to the ground.
You got me there on that one.
How about another beer?
I'm telling you, you surprise me.
You're not prepared at all tonight.
I fell asleep while going over my notes preparing for our conversation.
You do that too?
Coach.
Where's Diane today?
She must be out with Derek.
She's been out with him every day.
I'm sick of hearing about her.
Ever since Lady Dye-job arrived, she gets all the attention.
Nobody cares about me.
Nobody asks what Carla's doing any more.
Come on, now.
Be fair.
We weren't that interested in your life before she got here.
Well, Sam, thanks again.
Thank you for dropping me off.
Sure you can't come in for a drink?
I'd love to, but I'm in kind of a hurry.
I'm sorry I shrieked the wrong name.
That's OK.
- Hi, everyone.
- Hey, Sam.
Sammy.
My, my, Sammy.
Tell me true, not only did that gorgeous-looking girl go out with you, she also drove?
She didn't drive, she carried me.
Sam, I'm proud of you.
You took my wimp speech to heart.
Great to see you back in action.
Thank you.
It took my mind off my brother and your skinny co-worker.
I don't even care where they are any more.
Where are they?
Bobby and Susie saw them at the drive-in sharing a Coke and fries.
Afternoon, everybody.
- How you doing, Norm?
- Coach, I'm on top of the world.
Which is a dismal spot in Greenland somewhere.
- How's your new job coming?
- Don't bring that up.
I am no longer in the employ of Goldstein, Borman and Kawakami.
What happened?
I discovered that so-called medical corporation was a polite term for a den of thieves.
They're in the business of cheating on taxes.
So you resigned in protest.
Well, I took a long lunch and they canned me.
- The last angry man.
- Damn right, I'm angry, Sammy.
Those are rich people cheating on taxes.
And who has to foot the bill?
Honest folks.
Like me and you, and all you nice people at the bar that I've listed as my dependants.
So, where's Diane today?
She's not out with Derek again?
I don't believe it.
What happened to all the interesting talk around here?
I used to enjoy coming in here and listening to a good conversation.
Now there's so much gossip, you should all have dryers on your heads.
- I'm gonna be in the office.
- OK, Sam.
- So what'll you have?
- I'll have a cup of tea.
And I'll have a small sherry.
Now, that sounds nice.
Sherry sounds very nice.
And it is late afternoon.
I think I'll have a glass of sherry too, please.
- Two sherries.
- Make that a glass of wine.
- White wine.
- Wine.
I haven't had a glass of wine in ages.
Is your wine dry?
Yeah, it's OK.
- Give me some wine, too.
- Two wines.
You know what sounds like fun to me all of a sudden?
- What?
- A beer.
I haven't had a beer since I don't know when.
I used to have half a beer on a hot day.
Well, it's quite cold out today.
Then put a shot of whisky with it and it's perfect.
Two boilermakers.
Wild Turkey and Bud.
- I'll run a tab.
- Good.
What's wrong, Coach?
I didn't get the job in Venezuela.
They hired another guy.
- They didn't like your Spanish?
- The Spanish was fine.
They didn't like my English.
- That's too bad, Coach.
- Sorry.
Well, que so what, so what.
- Hello, everyone.
- Hi, Diane.
What are you doing here?
It's your day off?
I needed to be in a place where I had a few friends today.
So that's your next stop?
- Not today, Carla, please.
- What can I get you, honey?
I'll have a soda water.
- You never take a day off.
- Thursday's my day off.
- You work every Thursday.
- Yeah, but I go a little slower.
- So, tell me, how are you doing?
- Not very well.
- What is it?
- It's Derek.
What about him?
He's flying to Paris today, and he wants me to go with him.
He's a charming man, Coach.
He's everything I've been looking for.
And I think he's interested in me, too.
What a lousy break.
Wait a minute, Diane.
Maybe it's good.
- It is good.
- I'll tell you why.
The second I looked at you and Derek, I said, "There goes a cute couple.
" Yeah.
What about Sam?
Sam and Derek are a little cuter, yeah.
Coach, let me ask you a question.
You're asking a guy who's taken a lot of fast balls in the head.
Are you sure you want to ask the question?
- Do you think I'm a smart person?
- The smartest person I ever met.
Well, I, Diane Chambers, bred and educated to walk with kings, once offered a full scholarship at the Sorbonne, have become attracted to a six-foot-three-inch bubble-gum card.
I think I can help you with the sore buns, Diane, but ..
the rest of what you say is all over my head.
Coach, I'm making a confession here.
Not just to you, but to myself.
Maybe I'll feel better after I say this.
I I got it.
You're hot for Sam's chilli.
I think Keats would have said it differently, but I'll accept that.
Look, if you like Sam at all, I don't understand what the problem is here.
Derek's making a commitment.
All I ever get from Sam is adolescent flirtation.
I'm not sticking around for that.
If he'd give me something, anything, I'd stay.
Diane, you don't understand Sam.
Sam's the kind of a guy, you know, he keeps his feelings to himself.
The more he cares about something, the less he shows it.
I've been with him through his divorce, his boozing, the end of his career.
And let me tell you, the tougher things got, the cooler he got.
It's a damn sure bet that if he's not expressing himself to you, he's nuts about you.
Or he couldn't care less.
Do you mind if I say something?
Of course not, Norman.
Sometimes a man and a woman are so afraid of rejection that neither will take the first step of admitting their true feelings.
Norman, that's beautiful.
I do have a romantic side, Diane.
I know I make a lot of jokes about Vera, but the truth is if that woman ever packed her bags and left me, I don't know what I'd do first.
Well, I guess I have no choice but to force the issue.
Where's Sam?
He's in the office, honey.
I'll tell him I'm going away with his brother.
If he's honest and doesn't hide behind that tough jock façade, I'll stay.
But if he does one of his gratuitous jokes, I'm leaving.
- I swear it.
- Wait a minute, Diane.
Hold on.
You're putting your whole future on the line in this one moment.
You're letting your whole life turn on this one response?
- You're right.
- Can it wait till I go to the head?
No.
I'll hear about it.
Coach, what did you do that for?
That was our chance to get rid of her once and for all.
- Are you crazy?
- Crazy, Carla?
Crazy like a doorknob.
Hi, Diane.
Sam, your brother Derek has asked me to go to Europe with him, so I've come to say goodbye.
Dammit.
I didn't need to hear that.
What's wrong?
It's too late to put a help-want ad in tomorrow's paper.
Goodbye, everyone.
I'm leaving now.
I'll miss you all very much.
Bye, Diane.
Bye-bye.
Sorry, honey, I'm not interviewing till Monday.
Get this straight.
I'm going away with him.
Good.
Have fun.
This could lead to marriage.
Probably will.
- Will lead to marriage.
- Great.
We'll be Diane and Derek Malone.
We'll buy a spread somewhere and call it the Double-D.
It'll make a nice brand.
Children.
We'll have blonde, blue-eyed children everywhere.
- Have them brush after every meal.
- I'll be your sister-in-law.
You'll come over for dinner and say, "She sets a good table.
" Had to say something.
You just fed me.
I'll send you Christmas cards.
"To a wonderful brother.
" Nice to be remembered on the holidays.
The cards will have pictures of us.
Derek and I, the kids, the dogs.
The blonde ones will be the kids?
- This is alright with you?
- If you're happy.
- I'm ecstatic.
Goodbye.
- See you at the wedding.
- Do I get to kiss the bride?
- I think you know what you can kiss.
This is it, everyone.
I bid you a fond farewell.
I've enjoyed knowing you.
You've brought a lot to my life.
Bye.
- Goodbye, everyone.
- Bye.
- Farewell.
- Get the hell outta here.
Go.
I won't let it end this way.
I've had warts that went away quicker.
- What did I hit?
- My nose.
You're supposed to knock.
You were coming out to say something to me.
What is it?
- I wasn't gonna say anything.
- Yes, you were.
What was it?
- Go to the airport.
- Say it.
No.
What are you doing with that?
- Tell me what you were gonna say.
- Don't do that.
I hate that.
I hate that.
Please stop.
Would you just stop?
Put that down.
- Please don't go.
- Ask me nice.
- Come on.
- I deserve that much.
Ask me nice.
Just put it down.
Put the blackboard down.
Put it down.
Please stay.
- Why should I?
- Go on, get out.
I'm not sticking around in the hope something will happen between us.
- What is it you want from me?
- For you to tell me what you want.
I'll tell you exactly what I want.
I want to know what you want.
You're doing it again.
Listen, will you just explain one thing to me?
It is very important to me.
- Why aren't you with Derek?
- Because I like you better.
Diane, listen.
All the jealousy I felt for my brother over the years is nothing to what I felt these last five minutes.
We're about ready to start something that might be great.
Yeah.
Maybe we should kiss or something.
We're not gonna just kiss.
We're about to start something.
A kiss is where you start, isn't it?
You don't make an announcement when you kiss someone.
It wasn't an announcement.
I didn't want to catch you off guard.
On our first kiss, it's OK to be off guard.
You should be swept away.
I was.
Nobody's swept away when they say, "Maybe we should kiss.
" You're right.
When I do it, I won't say anything.
No.
This isn't right, either.
I didn't say anything.
I was swept away.
The moment's not right.
We're too aware of what we're doing.
You're right.
This whole thing is not going the way it should.
Maybe we should just forget about the kiss and hit the sack.
This is the dumbest conversation we have ever had, which means it's the dumbest conversation that's ever been.
Maybe this whole thing is just a mistake.
- What thing?
- This thing we're trying to do.
Every time we try to get together, it goes wrong.
Just cos I'm a neat-looking guy and you're kinda hungry Hungry?
No, listen.
What I mean by that is you've been here a long time.
If it was gonna happen, it would have happened by now.
It's silly of us to try to make it happen.
Fine.
You tell me this now that I've let Derek go.
Don't throw Derek in my face.
You never cared for Derek.
- You just used him to trap me.
- Trap you?
I'm the best thing to happen to you and you're too stupid to realise it.
You're the worst thing that happened to me.
Before you came, I was happy.
You believe you were happier before you met me?
Hell, yes.
How do you think it feels to be attracted to someone that makes you sick?
I could write a book on the subject.
You can't shut up long enough to write a cheque.
You are trying to change the subject.
The subject is, you can't shut up long enough to kiss me.
To save your life, I bet you couldn't shut up for 30 seconds.
- Make it ten.
- I most certainly could.
- Alright, let's see.
- You're going to time me?
That's right.
I'm gonna time you.
Ten seconds starting now.
- This is the most - You want to try again?
I wasn't really trying.
You want to see me do this?
Fine.
Starting now.
- This is the craziest thing - Really good.
So I can't do it.
Silence is overrated anyway.
- At least I have something to say.
- I don't?
The last conversation I had with Derek was about walking on the moors like Heathcliff and Catherine, and I threw it all away for this.
I'll tell you what you do.
Why don't you Get out of here.
Go on.
Take her with you.
Go on.
Get out.
- Don't push me.
- Why don't you just go find Derek?
Fine.
Shouldn't be hard to find him.
Just follow the applause.
- Maybe I can still catch him.
- Fine.
While you're floating around, remember this: you are the nuttiest, the stupidest, the phoniest fruitcake I ever met.
You are the most arrogant, self-centred - Shut up.
Shut your fat mouth.
- Make me.
Make you?
My God, I'm gonna bounce you off every wall in this office.
Try it, and you'll be walking funny tomorrow.
Or should I say funnier?
I always wanted to pop you one.
Maybe this is my lucky day.
- You disgust me.
I hate you.
- Are you as turned on as I am?
- More.
- Bet me.
- I'm gonna nibble on your ear.
- Don't tell me.
