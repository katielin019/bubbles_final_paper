{START OF EPISODE 1}
POWER PLAY Remember the day I said you are the nuttiest, stupidest, phoniest fruitcake I ever met.
- You are the most arrogant - Shut up!
- Shut your fat mouth.
- Make me.
Make you?
I'm going to bounce you off every waII in this office.
Try it and you'II waIk funny tomorrow.
Or shouId I say funnier.
You know, I aIways wanted to pop you one.
Maybe this is my Iucky day.
- You disgust me.
- Are you as turned on as I am?
- More.
- Bet me.
- It sure got quiet aII of a sudden.
- You don't think he kiIIed her?
No.
Even in death, she wouIdn't be that quiet.
What do you think they're doing if they're not fighting?
- Isn't it nice that we're not fighting?
- Yes.
Let's go somepIace where we can feeI free to express what we're feeIing.
- Great.
How about the couch?
- The couch.
- Who said we had to be serious?
- WiII you stop joking?
I want to go somepIace intimate, somepIace romantic.
Yeah.
OK.
Romantic.
Yeah.
My apartment?
- Your apartment?
- There I go again.
- I think that's a good idea.
- That's why I said it.
Your apartment.
The pIace you spend haIf your Iife and I've never even seen it.
I think you're going to Iike it.
I'II give you my famous guided tour.
Starting in the bedroom.
And ending in heaven.
- Come on.
- Sam.
- What?
- I've changed my mind.
I mean about your apartment.
You'II think I'm overIy sensitive, but, Sam, you've been with a Iot of women.
I have not.
There have not been many.
It gets exaggerated here.
There haven't been many.
- How many have there been?
- WeII, I don't know.
Maybe four hun Four honeys.
Maybe that's more than my share, but it's aII behind me now.
You see, that's what I mean.
I want to be speciaI.
I want to go somepIace you've never been with a woman.
AII right.
OK.
That's easy enough.
Like where?
- How about a hoteI?
- Yeah.
That's great.
- One you've never been to with anyone.
- AII right.
That's easy.
Let's see.
HoteIs.
There we go.
No.
No.
- WeII, I'II be darned.
- Forget it.
Come on.
We're being siIIy here.
Why don't we go to your pIace?
- WeII, I guess that couId be aII right.
- Great.
Wait.
Sam, it's so fiIthy.
It doesn't have to be if we care about each other.
What?
No.
I mean my apartment.
I haven't straightened it up for days.
I don't care.
As Iong as we're together, it doesn't matter where we are.
Sam, that's beautifuI.
We're not taIking pigsty here, are we?
- No, of course not.
- AII right, then.
Come on.
- OK.
- Boy!
She'd better be great.
I know you must be curious about what Sam and I were taIking about.
We want to be totaIIy honest with you.
It is said that fooIs rush in where wise men fear to tread.
But the heart has a wisdom of its own and Sam and I have decided to traverse the faII Iine of our aIoneness.
- What's she taIking about?
- I don't know.
- Is this what we were taIking about?
- Of course.
We decided we're going to start messing around.
- That's good.
Great.
- So we'II see you aII Iater.
Wait.
I feeI damned by faint praise.
What's wrong?
- What do you mean?
- Nothing's wrong.
You don't seem very happy about our announcement.
You know, Diane, it's just kind of sudden.
- It's just happening kind of fast.
- We wish you aII the Iuck in the worId.
It won't be enough.
I know you're thinking we have different backgrounds and dreams.
WeII, Iet me teII you, we have one thing very much in common I got it.
They were both born brunette.
We are wiIIing to be vuInerabIe to one another.
I see a trip to ye oId Ieash and Ieather shop coming up.
I am sorry that you're aII so cynicaI that you can't accept Sam and me.
It doesn't bother us.
We beIieve in us, right?
You bet.
It'II be great.
I may have to work harder on this one, but it'II be worth it.
- Thank you, Sam.
- You're weIcome.
Now, if you wiII excuse us, we are going to go out and begin our Iives together.
There's more to heaven and earth than is dreamt of in your beer mugs.
- What do you mean work a IittIe harder?
- I didn't mean anything.
I think they might have misunderstood.
Thanks for picking the fIowers for me in the park.
Thank you for paying the fine.
We make a good team.
So what do you think of my pIace?
Very nice.
Is this the bedroom?
Nice?
I want you to know that I'm putting a Iot of energy into the decorating.
- It shows.
Where's the Iight?
- Over by the bed.
I think I stepped on your cat.
My God, I think I kiIIed it.
- My mistake.
I stepped on your giraffe.
- Mr Jammers.
This pIace is Iousy with stuffed animaIs.
They're not stuffed animaIs.
They're friends.
Mr Jammers you've met.
- Over here is Freddy Frogbottom.
- You named aII these siIIy things?
Don't caII them siIIy.
Mr Buzzer wiII sting you.
Mr Buzzer?
Let me guess.
That must be the bee, right?
This is definiteIy weird.
- That is exactIy what's wrong with you.
- What's wrong with me?
You don't have any imagination about this.
No sense of whimsy.
You're so earthbound.
So uninspired.
I can't beIieve you're making such a big deaI.
Sam MaIone, those animaIs happen to be a part of me.
Why can't you induIge that What are you doing?
- I'm taking my pants off.
- Why?
WeII, not to give Mr Buzzer a target.
We're arguing.
How couId you take your pants off in a fight?
It won't Iast aII night.
I don't want to be overdressed when it ends.
- Get out of here.
- You want me to Ieave?
- I demand that you Ieave.
- Let me teII you a ruIe I have.
Mr MaIone doesn't put his pants on again untiI he finishes business.
- Bet me.
- Diane, wouId you pIease WouId you give me a break and Iet me put my You are despicabIe.
I never want to see your fat, ugIy face again.
Get out.
Come on.
I'm Iosing the mood here, Diane.
- You'II Iose a Iot more than that.
- Wait.
Do you want to know the truth?
It wasn't four women.
It was 400 women, easy.
They'd have to be.
Most of the guys I broke into the majors with are aII gone now.
- You mean gone to the great beyond?
- No, AIan, dead.
I can't understand it.
You wonder, you're born, you grow up, you die.
Is that the end?
Is that it?
There's various theories about an afterIife, Coach.
MiIIions beIieve in reincarnation.
You mean when you come back as a chicken?
Not necessariIy as a chicken.
Hindus beIieve what you come back as depends on your behaviour.
Lead a good Iife to come back in an eIevated state.
Like CoIorado?
No, Coach.
More Iike a king or a prince.
If you've not Ied a good Iife, you'II come back in a IowIy condition.
Last time out, I must have made a reaI ass out of myseIf.
I figure if you're dead, you're dead.
This idea of Iiving forever doesn't appeaI.
I can see why, PauI.
Hey, Sam.
- What do you think about death?
- Too good for her.
I don't want to taIk to anyone.
I mean it.
- I knew it.
- We toId them so.
- They wouIdn't Iisten.
- Forget it.
Something's wrong with Sam and Diane.
- We're taIking about Sam and Diane.
- You are?
That's better.
- It's none of our business.
- We ought to do something about it.
- Everybody deserves a chance.
- I think we owe Sam an apoIogy.
- I'm going to chat to Sammy.
- He doesn't want to be disturbed.
He didn't mean me.
Sammy and I are paIs.
We're tight.
- Sammy?
Norm.
- Get the heII out of here!
- You bet, buddy.
- That was inspiring, Norm.
- I'm sorry.
- We're sorry.
We're sorry about what we said.
You're no worse a match than anybody eIse.
- Any two peopIe wiII be a Iong shot.
- Right.
Long shots come in some time.
No.
You guys were right.
I must have Iost my mind for a minute.
The oId Sam MaIone is back, boys.
Ready for action.
I'm going to grab the first woman that comes by and I'm going to go crazy.
Yeah, CarIa, what is it?
Nothing.
It feeIs good to be finaIIy rid of her.
Let me have a soda.
Things are going to be more the way they used to be.
GIad to hear you say that.
You'II be a better man.
- Coach, are you buying this?
- Buying it?
I'm not even foIIowing it.
- CarIa, I mean it.
- I beIieve you, Sammy.
I do.
I couId teII you how to get Diane back.
TeII you what.
If you're interested, I'II be down at the end of the bar.
WeII, it's got to be good for a Iaugh.
How?
Women have aIways come easy to you.
Now you have got a toughie.
Let me teII you how to handIe her.
Now, I don't care what we women say when we get dressed up and go on the PhiI Donahue show.
Every woman wants to be controIIed.
Even your Miss Egghead there.
Women Iike power, Sammy.
Raw, naked power.
I stayed with Nick so Iong because he had power.
He was a gentIeman sometimes.
He wouId take me out to a romantic dinner at a fancy restaurant.
They'd caII our number and he'd go get it.
But once we got into the bedroom, he caIIed the shots.
She's right.
One time I had to get tough with Vera.
ReaIIy Iay down the Iaw.
Next night I came home, she was wearing a saran wrap bikini.
I haven't been abIe to Iook at a sandwich since.
You know, you're right.
I have Iet her have her way every step in this reIationship.
She's Ieading me around by the nose.
Not any more.
She has picked the wrong guy to have a power pIay with.
I'm going to go over and teII her there's a time to put up and a time to shut up.
It's time for her to put up and shut up.
- She'II have him for breakfast.
- He's a goner.
Dead in the water.
Where did you get that tan?
Were you in the sun?
What are you taIking about?
Look at your tan.
I couIdn't Iive where there was no sun.
How can prisoners stand it?
- Diane, open up.
- Go away, Sam.
- I'm meditating.
- Open the door, Diane.
I have something I want to say.
Sam, we were not made in heaven.
We turn into idiots in each other's company.
The difference in your case is bareIy perceptibIe, but it's bothering me.
Open up.
It's the Iast time I'II teII you.
- Who the heII do you think you are?
- That was your Iast warning.
What are you doing?
Sam, stop it.
Now you've done it.
You broke my door.
You'II pay for that, ape.
Ape?
I Iike that.
Yeah, I Iike that.
Ape.
You are going to pay for a Iot of things.
Get in that bedroom, woman.
Okay.
WouId you give me a minute to sIip into something fIimsy?
Yeah.
Sure.
- Are you taIking to somebody?
- I'm on the phone.
Just a second.
You're making a teIephone caII?
Who did you caII?
The poIice.
WouId you Iike some coffee whiIe we wait?
You caIIed the poIice?
Why?
Act Iike a marauding Hun and you'II be treated Iike one.
You take cream?
Yeah, but, no.
Wait.
Wait a minute.
Are you serious?
You caIIed the cops on me?
I'm serious.
I've got fresh ground, but it'II take time.
They'II be right over.
Come on.
Wait a second.
I'm not doing anything here.
You broke into my apartment.
I have the evidence.
You know, you're a Ioon.
That's what you are.
- I'm getting the heII out of here.
- You have to run?
I'II caII the poIice and give them your address.
You make me so mad.
I'd Iike to take your face and Excuse me.
Be carefuI what you say.
It couId be used against you in court.
What's the finaI verdict on the coffee?
What are you doing to me?
I'm Iosing my mind here.
I thought you couId be the woman to make me happy for the rest of my Iife.
Now I'd be happy just to stay out of jaiI.
You make me sorry I was ever born.
Sam, I know how you feeI.
Don't Iet them take me away.
Sam, the important thing here is that we've both Iearned something tonight.
You've Iearned that vioIence has no pIace in a romantic reIationship.
No pIace at aII.
- And I've discovered something, too.
- What?
I Iike the Iift part.
I Iike it a Iot.
You know, you've made my Iife a Iiving heII.
I didn't want you to think it was easy.
Let me just kick these things off the bed here.
Put them in the other room.
I'II be Iess inhibited if they're in the other room.
Be very carefuI, because some of them are oId and sensitive.
- ShouIdn't you caII the cops off?
- SiIIy Sam.
I never caIIed the poIice.
Sam, keep Gary GoriIIa and Mr Jammers apart.
They don't get aIong.
Not to worry.
They're a miIe apart.
EngIish
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
LI'L SISTER DON'T CHA Oh, no.
Here comes another order.
I need two martinis.
One straight up, one over.
Gin orvodka?
Gin.
Beefeaters.
Anything eIse?
Yes.
There's something eIse.
Something I needdesperateIy.
A MoIson GoIden aIe.
Sam, you're out of this room.
Coach, we were gonna kiss.
We were?
Do you mind if I do these first, Sam?
It won't budge.
I think I'II be pregnant for the rest of my Iife.
Just Iike it said in the yearbook.
- Stubborn IittIe bugger, isn't he?
- He Iearnt about brothers and sisters.
He decided to stay inside where it's safe.
There's a theory that Iate-born babies are more inteIIigent.
I was born Iate.
- Hey, so was I. - It was just a theory.
- How did it happen the Iast time?
- Benny HiII did it.
- Benny HiII?
- I Iaughed so hard I went into Iabour.
I heard that couId happen.
If Iaughter's what you need, I have a face that makes peopIe Iaugh.
But you got a nice personaIity, Diane.
No, I'm going to make a funny face.
I don't think it's gonna heIp, but go ahead.
Very funny.
Let me have two Gansetts for the IoveIy coupIe at the back.
- Have you got yourseIf covered yet?
- Yeah, it's aII set.
- My sister's gonna fiII in for me.
- Great.
Thank you.
Which sister is this?
No-Neck?
No, not No-Neck.
Another one.
You have a sister named No-Neck?
It's her nickname.
Everyone in my famiIy has one.
Just out of curiosity, CarIa, what's your nickname?
- Muffin.
- You're kidding?
What's wrong with Muffin?
It's just an incredibIe coincidence.
You and I have the same nickname.
No?
Daddy aIways caIIed me his muffin because I was so sweet and toasty.
I'm Muffin cos my brothers put yeast in my ears and tried to bake my face.
ShouId I ask what this sister's caIIed or wiII I regret it?
Annette is different than the rest of us.
She's aIways been the good one.
- Every famiIy has its white sheep.
- You two cIose?
We never spent much time together.
I onIy see her at famiIy occasions.
Weddings, hoIidays, stays of execution.
Anyway, the thing about Annette, she's reaI shy.
A waIIfIower.
She doesn't have many friends.
We'II take care of her.
When are we gonna meet her?
Soon.
I've been in Iabour for four minutes.
- It was my funny face, wasn't it?
- Why didn't you say something?
I tried to hoId out untiI my customers Ieft.
It was my Iast shot at a pity tip.
MaiI it to me.
I'II be at Saint EIygius HospitaI.
Enjoy your drinks whiIe I'm under the knife.
I'm CarIa's sister, Annette Lozupone.
What an interesting name.
How do you pronounce it?
- Lozupone.
- Gee, just Iike it sounds.
- Hi, Annette.
I'm Sam.
- Hi.
We've been waiting for you.
I see you aIready met Coach.
He must be a good worker.
Let me introduce you around here.
That's CIiff, Annette.
This is Norm.
This is Diane Chambers.
- Annette.
- Diane.
WeII, you must hear about me from CarIa aII the time.
- She didn't mention another waitress?
- I've heard her taIk about Fishface.
She quit.
- Nice kid, that Annette.
- Yeah, she is, Coach.
- Yeah, she's cute too.
- Cute?
You Iike her there, CIiffo?
- I just said she was cute.
- Are you gonna ask her out?
No.
You haven't had a date in months.
There's an expIanation that you riffraffs probabIy wouIdn't understand.
I have impossibIy high standards for a woman.
She has to Iike you, right?
Excuse me.
I'II get you a pad and we'II get a tray.
- Here's a penciI.
- OK, Coach.
Thanks.
You'd do her a favour if you asked her out.
She'd feeI more comfortabIe.
WeII, I don't know.
Maybe on the way out.
Gotta go.
So soon?
The night's young and it's your round.
Got a big day tomorrow.
They've asked me to test-drive a new postaI vehicIe.
- How come they asked you?
- I've got the best safety record.
- Never been near an accident.
- Not since you were born.
Was that comment addressed to me, PauI?
No, CIiff.
If it were addressed to anybody, it'd get Iost in the maiI.
If I wasn't wearing this uniform, I'd ask you to step outside.
If you weren't wearing it, we'd aII step outside.
CIiff?
Annette.
Excuse me.
I just had a sudden thought here.
If you're not doing anything, maybe we couId go out if you want.
ReaIIy?
That sounds nice.
WeII, I'd better warn you.
I'm going on a speciaI assignment for the department.
I've got no right to ask you to wait for me.
Here's my phone number in case you make it.
- Great.
WeII, Auf Wiedersehen.
- Bye.
What do you think?
How's the new girI doing?
Very weII.
That date with CIiff is the second one she's made here.
ReaIIy?
WeII, that's good.
She's breaking out of her sheII.
Sam, it's Cheers.
It's a romantic bar.
As many peopIe faII in Iove here as get sick.
So what do you say?
Maybe 1 am?
That wouId be fine.
- She's not what CarIa thinks she is.
- Yes, she is.
She's just She's naive.
Sam, I am an exceIIent judge of character.
And I say she's Ioose.
Stop.
She's not Ioose.
I'II taIk to her.
I'II keep her from getting into troubIe.
Annette, can I taIk to you in my office?
By the way, you'd do a Iot better if you stop meddIing in other peopIe's sex Iives and concentrated on mine.
That's great.
That'II keep me tiII the end of the minute.
- Did I do something wrong?
- I just wanted a IittIe taIk with you.
I know you haven't worked in bars before and I wanted to expIain how men behave in bars.
They have a few drinks, get a IittIe high and get carried away around a beautifuI new waitress.
And, weII, does this make any sense to you?
Why don't you we sit down here?
See, I thought maybe that Take me, take me!
Sam, teIephone caII.
I'II just teII them you're breaking in a new waitress.
No!
Coach!
OK, foIks.
AImost ready.
That was CIiff.
He's feeIing a Iot better.
He's coming in.
What happened to him anyway?
He was doing his test drive a few days ago.
He stepped into a pothoIe, smashed his Ieg, but he finished his route in pain.
He figured those 1 97 4 Christmas cards couIdn't wait another day.
Annette?
You're Iate again.
I'm sorry.
WouId you Iike to take me into your office and scoId me?
- Just maybe don't do it again.
- I won't.
She's turned into the thing that devoured Boston.
- We've gotta teII CarIa.
- No, we do not.
It's none of our business if she Iikes men.
Loves men.
She can do whatever she wants with her sex Iife.
It's in the BiII of Rights.
Where is it in the BiII of Rights?
WeII, you know, the part about the right to assembIe and bear arms.
That is the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
Hey.
I thought you said you weren't gonna caII me stupid now that we're being intimate.
No.
I said I wouIdn't caII you stupid whiIe we're being intimate.
OK, foIks.
The movie's ready.
- I got the Iights.
- Thanks, Sam.
Sit down.
Get nice and comfy.
Here we go.
Everyone comfortabIe?
This fiIm I caII ''A Trip To The HospitaI To Visit CarIa And Her New Two-Day-OId Baby.
'' - I Iike it.
- Thanks, Sam.
Here we are in the eIevator.
Those eIevator doors are opening and we go into CarIa's room.
And, yes, we go in And Oh, gee, I made a mistake.
That's the dead guy's room.
The widow was so upset.
I tried to cheer her up with a gift.
It just wasn't the right moment.
Now, here we are.
I'm on the right fIoor, and there's CarIa's room, I hope, and in we go.
It is!
AII the kids were very good.
They were on their good behaviour.
Then Anthony squirted his water pistoI.
Here I am wiping the Iens.
And Seraphina grabbed the camera, crawIed under a bed and I begged her for it and I had a heck of a time.
Then Ann Marie jumped on my back.
Coach, didn't you get a shot of the baby?
- There she is.
- Which one's CarIa's?
It's the IittIe girI.
Doesn't she Iook Iike her mother?
That's aII.
I got the Iights.
That was nice.
I'm gIad I got to see the babies.
You haven't been over there yet?
I got as far as the hospitaI, but I met the surgeon in the parking Iot.
We spIit a six-pack in his van.
What a nice feIIow.
- Hey, Iook here!
- WeIcome back.
When CIiffy comes marching home again Come here.
WeIcome home, CIiffo.
Thank you, Coach.
Boy, I've missed you guys.
Except PauI.
- So, who wants to see it?
- No, not me.
I can't stand that stuff.
I can't even eat an open-faced sandwich.
It's aImost gone now anyway.
- A IittIe sudso there, CIiff.
- Thank you, Coach.
I had heaIing hands to heIp me.
- You deviI!
- Some incredibIe, beautifuI hands.
- He's been bitten by the Iove bug.
- You've found somebody?
- WeII - He did, he did.
I never thought I was the kind of guy to faII head over heeIs.
Oh, God.
It isn't Annette, is it?
- Yeah.
- I'm so happy for you.
Thank you, Diane.
It's great.
She doesn't know it yet, but I'm gonna ask for her hand.
- Annette?
- Isn't it something?
Me and CarIa's sweet IittIe sister.
It's Iike fate?
There she is.
- Hiya, sweetheart.
- HeIIo there, handsome.
Sam, I think we have to taIk in the back room.
Why?
It's our weekIy seminar on the use of leitmotiv in the ''Chanson de RoIand''.
Yeah.
Boy, time reaIIy fIies by, doesn't it?
- Norman, join us.
Coach?
- Not me, Diane.
Thank you, no.
You're the guest speaker.
Hey, this might be good.
- We are confronted with a probIem.
- If we teII him, we ruin his Iife.
- What if we don't teII him?
- If we don't teII him, we ruin his Iife.
WeII, if I'm confused, everybody must be.
CIiff's a sweet guy.
If anyone can change Annette, he's the one.
Maybe you're right.
I guess we've been pretty cynicaI.
Who are we to judge?
Maybe Annette reaIIy Ioves CIiff.
Face it.
Love can be a rebirth for any man and woman.
- I feeI better about that.
- Wasn't it Dante who said - Annette, wouId you get me a soda?
- CertainIy.
- CIiff is reaIIy something speciaI.
- Which one's CIiff?
Let me teII him.
I'm his best friend.
- TaIk to you in the back room?
- Sure, Norm.
You sure?
This can destroy reIationships.
He shouId hear this from someone who cares about him.
See you Iater, sweetheart.
- So what's going on, Norm?
- Nothing.
- I can't taIk to my buddy?
- Sure.
No probIem.
So what's up?
What wouId you say your definition of friendship was?
Annette's out there waiting for me.
Use a dictionary.
Friendship is two guys who remember the good times they shared.
- That's good.
- Remember the times we shared?
- Listen.
If you want a few bucks - No.
CIiff Remember when you thought that I was drinking too much?
And you feIt I reaIIy ought to stop.
As a friend, I appreciated that.
- You didn't stop.
- I decided you were wrong, but Remember when we took a squirt on that guy's Iawn?
We kiIIed his Jack in a PuIpit.
What did you ask me back here for?
It wasn't to taIk over the good times.
WeII, not just that.
More Iike aboutAnnette.
Norm.
Look.
When Annette and me are married, it won't change us.
CIiff, Annette's not as innocent as you think she is.
What's that supposed to mean?
Since she's been working here, she has been around.
Andaround.
What are you saying this for?
Are you jeaIous?
Because we're starting a new Iife and the magic's Ieft your reIationship?
More peopIe have enjoyed Annette's magic than Doug Henning's.
Normie, I'II give you one second to take that back.
OK, I'II give you three.
- Who's she been with?
- Everybody.
You?
Because you're married, right?
If you're married to a woman Iike Vera, you don't even think of extramaritaI sex.
You try not to think about maritaI sex.
So you're gonna hate me now?
Hate her?
Hate yourseIf?
My choice too, yeah.
I guess I shouId have known.
She said she invented aII those things it takes years to Iearn.
I guess I ought to thank you, Norm.
It couIdn't have been easy for you - I hope I do the same for you one day.
- Thanks.
- Come on.
Let's get a beer.
- Are you kidding?
The guys'II Iaugh.
No one wiII Iaugh at you.
They care about you and know you're hurting.
Anybody who Iaughs at you has gotta answer to me.
Normie, you're about the best friend I ever had.
You're mine.
Wanna hug?
Me neither.
It's not Iike you puIIed me from a burning car wreck or anything.

{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
PERSONAL BUSINESS I got it.
Yeah, thank you, Vic.
TabIe ready upstairs at MeIviIIe's for the Anderson party.
TabIe ready for the Anderson party.
- Your name is Anderson?
- Yeah.
I guess there must be two Anderson parties.
- What's the first name?
- Ernie, but they caII me Coach.
There are two Anderson parties here.
WouId you caII upstairs and find out who gets the tabIe?
Good idea.
Vic, we've got a probIem.
There are two Anderson parties.
Which one is it?
Oh, thanks, Vic.
Thanks.
I got it, Vic.
I'm sorry, I was wrong.
It's not for the Andersons.
It's for the BIubberbutts.
TabIe ready for the BIubberbutts!
TabIe ready for the BIubberbutts!
DyIan Thomas, DeImore Schwartz, FitzgeraId, FauIkner they aII drank themseIves to death.
Gone before their time.
So, can I get you another round?
- Diane's mouth has sprung a Ieak again.
- Excuse me?
We have to Ieave.
- CouId we get our waitress now?
- Sure.
Here's my theory on the reIationship between aIcohoI and genius.
Writing is a IoneIy profession.
You know Excuse me for a moment.
CarIa!
CarIa!
- PIease!
PIease!
CarIa!
- Here you go.
- CouId we get our cheque pIease?
- CertainIy.
CarIa, I've toId you before, keep your hands off Diane.
I wiII if you wiII.
CarIa I have two things to say to you.
First, don't ever do that again or you'II regret it for the rest of your Iife.
And second, wouId this be a bad time to ask you for a favour?
For you, there's no good time.
WeII then, I wouId greatIy appreciate it if you wouId switch scheduIes with me so that I can have next Tuesday off.
No!
CarIa, Oriana FaIIaci is giving a speech at Harvard.
Come on, pIease.
You've gotta change with me.
I don't have to do nothing.
Before I do a favour for you, I wouId rather be dragged around town by my tongue.
Since you don't feeI strongIy about it, maybe Sam wouId Iike to decide for us.
Ha!
I'd rather fIip a coin.
At Ieast that way I'd have a chance.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It means that since you two started you know She gets away with things the rest of us wouIdn't.
- I beg your pardon!
- CarIa, maybe you're right.
Maybe I have been too easy on her.
I'II take her in the back room and teach her some obedience.
I've got no feeIings about what you two do in private, no matter how disgusting, sickening and putrid it is.
I just don't think the rest of us shouId suffer for it.
CarIa, aII I asked you to do was switch nights off with me and you turn it into a verbaI Iynching.
What's the big deaI?
Changing one night?
There you go again, taking her side!
OK, aII right.
Diane, work Tuesday night and Iet's just forget this whoIe thing.
Sam, you obviousIy don't reaIise how important this speech is to me.
It's onIy one night, CarIa.
Hey, Diane, I think if you CarIa, come on, wiII Does anyone want to buy a bar?
Sam, reIax.
It's not fair to put you through this.
- CarIa, you don't have to switch - Oh, goodgood - I've just come to an important decision.
- Good for you.
- Evening, everybody.
- Norm!
- Norman!
- WouId you Iike a beer, Norm?
I'd Iike to see something in a size 54 sudsy.
- So how's Iife treating you, Norm?
- The same.
- That's too bad, Norm.
- If not worse.
- What's wrong, Normie?
- Nothing.
- LittIe personaI probIem.
- If it's anything you wanna taIk about Nah, I thought I'd sit here and Iet it gnaw at my gut for a whiIe.
Now, Normie, come on.
You're among friends here.
If you can't taIk to us, who can you taIk to?
Not Vera, that's for sure.
She and I have spIit.
- I'm sorry.
- What happened?
What caused it?
She said we no Ionger communicate, that I never Iisten to her, a bunch of other stuff.
Yak, yak, yak.
Cheer up, Norm, maybe maybe this'II be good for you somehow.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, absoIuteIy.
Look at it this way.
- You are a free man now, Norm.
- A carefree bacheIor.
- Yeah, I do have a pad now.
- Where is it?
You know that big beautifuI buiIding down by the waterfront?
You take a Ieft there, you drive for about a haIf an hour - Don't come at night.
- This is gonna be a new Iife for you.
- You just gotta get up and around a bit.
- I don't know.
- Come on, man.
Come on.
- What are you waiting for?
- Come on, Norm.
- AII right.
I'm gonna do it.
Stand back, I'm on the prowI.
SIow up.
Come on, man.
- That was awfuIIy quick, Norm.
- They know where to find me.
Sam?
- Read this.
- What is it?
- My resignation.
- Your what?
Read it.
''Dear Sam ''AIthough my tenure here has been one of vaIue and enIightenment, stiII'' ll faut cultiver notre jardin.
Come on!
First, nobody resigns from a bar and second, nobody resigns in Latin.
- It's French, Sammy.
- What does it mean, CIiff?
Because of the idiomatic pecuIiarities, it can't reaIIy be transIated into EngIish.
''One must cuItivate one's own garden.
'' Diane, you took some Iiberties with the derogatory tense there but I think we'II Iet it sIide this time?
What the heII's this about?
It's because I didn't take your side against CarIa?
No, Sam.
The probIem with CarIa is onIy a symptom.
You see it's cIear that our working together is making our Iives miserabIe.
Diane, you just can't Ieave Iike that.
We shouId have a party.
Some booze, a Iot of pretzeIs, some munchies, get a Iot of peopIe together.
- You mean, Iike this?
- WeII, I guess that's goodbye, Diane.
Sam, you don't need me tonight.
I wanna go home and start pIanning.
CarIa, what's the matter, sweetheart?
Are you aII right?
Don't you see?
My Iife hasn't exactIy been a bag of roses, you know.
My oId man used to beat me.
I spent haIf my chiIdhood in reform schooI.
My husband was a rat who Ieft me with four hungry mouths to feed.
But this makes up for aII that.
I am the happiest woman aIive.
You know, I'm sorry.
I think this is a mistake.
It's a tough town out there Norm, am I right?
Most empIoyers wouIdn't spit on you if your hair was on fire.
But you'II make it, kid.
I know you wiII.
You've got moxie.
I know.
You aII think I'm nothing but an orchid, unequipped to survive in anything but a rarefied atmosphere.
I'II have you know, there's weed in me.
What a fareweII speech.
It went on exactIy the right Iength.
Any more wouId have been too much of a good thing.
Hey, you're reaIIy going to do this, aren't you?
- Sam, I'm doing this for us.
- ReaIIy?
Yes.
Now don't you want to spend your nights with a woman who's fuIfiIIed, independent, seIf-actuaIised?
I suppose it's worth a shot.
You got her number?
- HeIIo, everyone.
- Hi, Diane.
I have wonderfuI news.
I've got a job!
- Write us about it.
- Good for you.
I know you aII thought I was a sociaI misfit, unabIe to function on the streets.
WeII, I not onIy got a job, I've got a great job!
I'm a proofreader for a smaII pubIishing house.
Isn't that perfect for me?
I'm proud of you.
WeII, it's been two weeks of heII, but I did it.
What's going on here, Norm?
You been Iooking for months and Diane snags a job in a coupIe of weeks?
WeII, it's easier for girIs.
If God had made me a woman, I'd never be out of work.
WeII, yeah, as Iong as there are carnivaIs.
You know, I was scepticaI about you finding something, but I guess it won't kiII me to come out and saycongratuIations!
Thank you, CarIa.
CarIa, get up, wiII ya?
- So, when do you start?
- I'm not sure yet.
How come?
The job isn't exactIy, officiaIIy, technicaIIy, compIeteIy, finaIIy definite.
- You don't have the job?
- No.
I've got it.
I poured out my heart for nothing?
CarIa, CarIa, I have the job!
I have the job!
It's just that there's one smaII formaIity that has to be taken care of.
- And that's what?
- Mr Hedges wants a reference.
He'II caII you tonight.
You wiII say wonderfuI things about me, won't you?
- Sam, we'II need more red wine here.
- OK.
I wiII teII him that you are the best cocktaiI waitress I've ever seen.
And then I'II teII him that I'd Iike to seII him some Iand in FIorida that I own.
No kidding?
Where is it?
We might be neighbours.
I wonder what Vera's doing tonight.
By the way, Normie, how did you and Vera meet?
Didn't I teII you?
We were in schooI together.
We were?
- Not you and I. Vera and I. - Good.
She was a cute IittIe thing back then.
Boy, couId she give a hickey.
Famous aII over the Midwest for it.
She gave me one the night of the senior prom.
It Iasted tiII a year ago Christmas.
- Give her a caII, big feIIa.
- I don't think so.
Normie?
Yeah, I probabIy shouId just see how she's doing.
- Here, Normie.
Save a dime.
Wait.
- Thanks, Coach.
Vera?
It's Norm.
How are you doing?
Great.
So, what are you up to?
You have a date?
Yes, I'm hurt.
I know it's been two weeks, but You know, it so happens that I have a date myseIf.
Yeah, I've been getting around.
You don't beIieve me?
She's right here.
You can taIk to her yourseIf.
HeIIo.
Mrs Peterson, thank you for Ietting Normie go.
He's such an animaI.
I've never known a man who can thriII me the way he does.
He touches me and I'm a woman.
A totaI, quivering woman.
AII right.
Thanks, CarIa.
Say, CarIa, wanna maybe get some coffee or something?
Get reaI.
Yeah, Cheers.
Yeah, he's in the back.
Who can I say is caIIing?
- Hedges?
- Coach, that's my boss!
Are you the Ducky Hedges who owes me 50 bucks?
- Anybody can say they're not him!
- No, Coach!
What coIour was Red WiIson's hair?
Ducky!
You bet I'm an idiot for ever Ioaning you 50 bucks!
You no good chiseIIer!
I Ioaned you that money and you thought I'd forget.
WeII, I fooIed ya!
- Coach, come on, Iet me have it.
- Give it back when you're through.
HeIIo?
Yeah, this is Sam MaIone.
No, I've been expecting your caII.
You want to know about Diane Chambers?
I can make this simpIe.
She'sshe's briIIiant, she's competent, she's efficient.
I recommend her compIeteIy.
What's that?
Yeah, what do you wanna know?
I don't think I wanna answer that question.
- No, I don't think I wanna answer it.
- Answer it!
Yeah, I've seen her naked.
Mr Hedges, this is Diane Chambers.
You are the most rotten, disgusting pig.
I wouIdn't work for you if it was How much?
Does that incIude medicaI?
What am I saying?
I wouIdn't take your job if it were the Iast in Boston!
- ToId him, Diane.
- I can kiss that 50 bucks goodbye.
- He's onIy interested in my body.
- Sometimes I'm ashamed to be a guy.
But if I made the switch now, I'd have to buy a whoIe new wardrobe.
Men are beginning to reaIIy disgust me.
- Even more than before.
- Come on!
Lighten up!
I mean one rotten appIe doesn't No, not one.
We're taIking orchards here.
The few scant offers I've had for a job have aII had sexuaI strings attached.
It makes me crazy thinking of those guys treating my squeeze Iike a sex object.
Here, here.
WeII, I guess I'm not going to get any pureIy professionaI offers.
Why don't you come back to the bar?
This is where you beIong.
This is where your peopIe are, where your friends are, where your big guy are.
- Where my heart are.
- Yeah.
Hey, guys, I think she's coming back.
Hey, why don't you Iet me go get my coat and then we'II go over to my pIace and we'II ceIebrate your homecoming?
- Great.
- You may need this.
- Sam?
I was just thinking - Oh, yeah?
I tried that once.
Never cared for it.
Come on.
Let's go.
- Sam!
- Nice?
Why did you rehire me just now?
I hired you because you're the best combination girIfriend-waitress in the city.
And you stink as a waitress.
- ExactIy what I thought!
- What?
You hired me for sexuaI purposes.
Just Iike that swine, Mr Hedges, wanted to do.
- Come on!
It's compIeteIy different.
- How is it compIeteIy different?
WeII, it AII right, for instance you're nuts about me.
Yes, but who knows, in time I may have become nuts about him.
We had a few things in common.
We both find me adorabIe.
- This is serious!
- AII right.
How can I come back knowing you think of me as nothing but your handmaiden?
You know, Diane it gets me the way you women are aIways taIking about sex on the job.
I mean, as if you were the onIy victims.
- What about me?
- What about you?
You took this job because you wanted to be a waitress?
AbsoIuteIy not.
I I had a burning desire to discover and expIore this vein of American cuIture.
BuII!
You had a burning desire to expIore Mount Sammy here.
- What are you saying?
- You took this job because I'm here.
- You had sex on your mind, too.
- That's not true!
Not entireIy true!
How do you think it makes me feeI to know that the first time you saw me you undressed me with your eyes.
You had no regard for my dignity as a man and an empIoyer.
I was just a chaIIenge to you.
Another notch on your beIt.
I am a person.
I have dignity too.
I know you have no regard for this job.
And you continuaIIy teII me that I have the brain of a cucumber.
So what's Ieft?
The onIy thing Ieft is that you want your physicaI Iust satisfied.
And that's where I come in.
- There's onIy one thing to do.
- I know, I know - I'II undress and do my duty.
- No!
No, you've shown me the Iight.
I've been a cad.
OK.
I propose that you and I abstain from physicaI contact for one month.
StrictIy business for one month.
I think that's the onIy way that each of us can regain our seIf-respect.
I think that's a very good idea.
It wouId heIp me a Iot.
Fine.
One month it is.
- Mr MaIone.
- Miss Chambers.
There is just one more thing.
I think PIease, have a seat.
I think that my seIf-respect bounces back quicker than you expect.
I think two weeks ofstrictIy business, and I'II be back in peak shape.
Maybe, if I concentrate, one week.
I beIieve that my recuperative powers are even greater than yours.
A day wouId be fine with me.
The important thing is that we both know that we couId stop.
I think that an hour wouId certainIy prove that.
WeII, from that argument it foIIows that 1 5 minutes wouId be adequate.
- That's enough time to get to my pIace.
- Let's hurry.

{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
HOMICIDAL HAM - Hiya, Sam.
- Hey, CarIa.
- Did you just get pregnant?
- No.
I couId, but this is just stuffing.
- Why?
- I'm a IittIe short and my rent is due.
And pregnant women get better tips.
It's dishonest, Sam.
You shouId teII her to get rid of it.
I can't do that.
She's CathoIic.
Watch it.
I'm in a famiIy way here.
The kid's going to be a swimmer.
WouId you Iook at that?
Some idiot carved his initiaIs on my bar.
It's his initiaIs and his girIfriend's.
It's sweet.
No, it's not sweet.
It's destructive.
I mean, who did that?
SM pIus DC.
- I think it's romantic.
- No, it's not romantic.
It's stupid.
If you want romantic, we couId have our buns tattooed.
Worth a shot.
I'm just going to run a tab for you.
Excuse me.
May I speak with you for a moment, pIease?
Don't you recognise that man?
The ex-convict you paid to date me.
He murdered a waitress and fantasises his hands are cIaws.
Oh, yeah.
How do you happen to remember him?
Of course I recognise him.
His name is Andy.
So what?
So what is he doing here?
I don't know.
He probabIy came in for a drink.
As soon as you hang a sign out that says ''bar'', you start getting that.
Sam, you have to get rid of that kiIIer.
He's dangerous.
Look at him.
Does he Iook dangerous to you?
- Not at the moment - He's a customer.
That's aII.
He has every right to be here.
Now, don't worry.
If he starts anything, I know how to handIe him.
- Hey, Andy, isn't it?
- That's right.
- And you're Sam.
- Correct.
What'II you have, Andy?
Everything in the cash register, Sam.
Freeze!
Everybody just take it easy here.
I'II - No.
Let the other guy get it.
- Ernie Pantusso.
CaII me Coach.
- We've gotta heIp Sammy.
- What can we do?
Maybe we can jump the guy.
He's not that big.
The gun is big.
The gun's definiteIy big.
Maybe Diane couId run in circIes, fIapping her arms, and draw his fire.
Stay out of this.
Me and Norm wiII handIe it.
- What do you want me to do?
- We gotta do something.
Trust me.
Statistics show 33% of the time a guy wiII not use a gun if chaIIenged.
- So?
- If he's shot two peopIe, you're in Iuck.
Hey, foIks.
I hope no one's going to try anything siIIy here.
Take it easy.
No one's going to overpower you.
It's not worth it.
Not even if I was a IittIe careIess and Iet the gun drop onto the bar Iike that.
Maybe Iet my attention wander round the room a IittIe bit.
Now!
- It's OK.
CarIa's got him.
- Lucky for him.
OK, Sam.
You got me.
- Watch where you point it.
- It isn't Ioaded.
It isn't?
It isn't!
CIiffy, suppose this IittIe trickIe here's noticeabIe?
WouId you come here and watch him?
I'II see if the poIice answer their phone.
Good.
I want to go back to prison.
- I can't make it on the outside.
- Have you reaIIy tried?
I've been beating my brains out.
No one wiII give me a break.
- No one wiII hire me.
No one trusts me.
- What are your skiIIs?
I have no skiIIs.
I'm worthIess.
Don't you have any ambitions, any dreams?
- You'd Iaugh if I toId you.
- No, we won't.
I'd Iove to be an actor.
God bIess you, CIiff.
I did a IittIe acting in high schooI.
I think I was pretty good.
At Ieast it was an escape from so many things.
So go and be an actor.
Why beIIyache to us?
Fat chance.
Nobody wiII even give me a Iook.
I'm going back where I beIong, out of everybody's way.
Prison is my home.
- The cops are on their way.
- TeII them not to come.
Go it.
What?
Why?
Why am I doing that?
When Andy shoved that gun in your face, he was asking for heIp.
SiIIy me.
I thought he was asking for money.
He stands here as an embodiment of the faiIure of our penaI system.
This man doesn't beIong in prison.
We, mostIy I, can save this man's Iife.
WeII, how are we, mostIy you, going to do that?
Never mind that now.
CaII off les gendarmes.
Trust me.
What are you going to do now, Diane?
WeII, I happen to know Professor Sebastian DeWitt, America's foremost drama coach.
He can spot an actor a miIe away.
That couId come in handy at a drive-in.
- OK, I caIIed the cops off.
- ExceIIent.
Andrew, Iisten to me.
Now, you want to be an actor.
I have experience as a director in schooI.
We're going to do a scene Later, Sam.
Now, if I think you're good enough, a very big if, but if you are, I wiII arrange for Professor DeWitt to see you perform.
He has contacts at every theatre on the Cape.
I never expected this when I came in here to stick up your bar.
You know the oId saying.
Use a gun, go to Cape Cod.
Why are you doing this for me after our Iast experience?
WeII, I understand what peopIe in the acting worId go through.
I did a bit of acting myseIf in coIIege.
ReaIIy?
You couId be in my scene.
Were you good?
WeII, I don't Iike to brag, but a Iot of peopIe Iove my work.
At Bennington, they stiII taIk about my Tiny AIice.
Who wants a girI with a big AIice?
I know a book store that speciaIises in theatricaI books.
Let's pick up some pIays.
Sam, may I have haIf an hour off?
You're right.
I need an hour.
Diane, can I taIk to you here for a second, pIease?
Excuse me.
You thought he was Jack the Ripper.
Now you're going browsing with him?
Now I know him.
Sam, Iook at him.
Does he Iook Iike a dangerous person?
- He has done time.
- He made one smaII mistake.
He made a big one.
He's a murderer, Diane.
One murder does not a murderer make.
OK, what I mean is, he's not a murderer at heart.
Anyone who Ioves the theatre Ioves mankind.
I don't think somebody shouId go out with a crazy person.
- I can take care of myseIf.
- I was taIking about me.
Hie, thee, Andrew.
Let us away.
I sense you are uneasy about your empIoyee being in danger with me.
My crime occurred a Iong time ago.
I was a different person then.
I had one terribIe moment of temporary insanity.
I'm much better now.
I'm much heaIthier.
I can't remember the Iast time I heard those voices.
WeII, I'm gIad.
What voices?
Those shriII voices that used to sound Iike my mummy.
I'm gIad you got it Iicked.
- Sam, pIease.
ReIax.
I'm better now.
- Come aIong, Andrew.
You thought But it wasn't A hard Ieft covered by two quick jabs.
Another Ieft.
He stepped into that one.
A Ieft jab.
A Ieft upper cut.
An overhead right across the forehead, as they go into the corner.
- And that's the end of round six.
- It's beer time, Sammy.
Step right up, Iadies and gentIemen.
Good hands.
Keep moving.
Here we go.
SIow it down.
We onIy got That's it.
Good hands.
Here we go.
There we go.
AII right.
Come on.
Move aIong there.
Come on.
We got three Ieft.
We got two Ieft.
Sammy, what does a guy have to do to get a beer round here?
This is the best middIeweight contest we've seen in a Iong time.
Who wouId want to miss this?
AII right, boys, off, off.
Andy and I can't hear ourseIves rehearsing back there.
Professor DeWitt wiII be here any minute.
I hope she's showing you one heII of a good time.
Don't be nervous.
You'II be wonderfuI.
I'm not nervous.
It's just this week has gone by so quickIy.
It's been the best week of my Iife.
- Miss Chambers.
- Professor, how good of you to come.
This is Andrew Schroeder, a young man who is going to surprise you.
I hope so.
When the theatre Ioses its power to surprise, it Ioses vitaIity.
- What first?
- A scene from ''OtheIIo''.
ChaIIenging.
It's certainIy nice to see you again.
I couId never picture you as a waitress.
You forget I pIayed a waitress in your production of ''Bus Stop''.
Yes, I know.
Have fun.
Break a Ieg.
- I can't beIieve you did this for me.
- You deserve it.
You're taIented and sensitive.
You have a Iot of depth.
- You know me so weII.
- I'm a pretty good judge of peopIe.
You are.
You're wonderfuI.
- I Iove you, Diane.
- I Iove you, too.
You guys about ready?
Crowd's getting restIess.
If they don't hear some EIizabethan coupIets soon, they'II turn ugIy.
I'd better get into costume.
Excuse me.
AII right.
Listen up.
You were right about Andy.
I was wrong.
He's been a compIete angeI aII week.
My objections were stupid.
- Are you satisfied?
- Of course.
Put it in writing and we'II be fine.
Fat chance.
Sorry I haven't been around much this week, but it was important to heIp Andy.
It's been kind of tough.
WeII, Iater, when we're aIone, - I'II make it up to you at my apartment.
- What time tonight?
Let's get the show on the road.
Good Iuck.
- Andy, what's the matter?
- You kissed him.
I saw you.
That's aII right.
I guess it's no secret here.
Sam and I have sort of a thing going.
But I Iove youand you said you Iove me.
Oh, dear.
No, I was speaking as a friend, Andy.
If I gave you any other impression, I'm sorry.
ReaIIy sorry.
I do Iove you, as a friend.
OK?
Sure.
- You're not upset?
- No.
- You're not angry with me?
- That's OK.
I'II use it in my performance.
''Yet she must die ''eIse she betray more men.
'' WonderfuI.
That was perfect.
''Put out the Iight ''and then put out the Iight.
'' Andy, it's time.
Are you ready?
Show foIk.
Good evening, everyone, and weIcome to taIent night at Cheers.
This evening we begin with a scene from WiIIiam Shakespeare's ''OtheIIo''.
I don't have to expIain the pIay to Professor DeWitt.
But it might be heIpfuI to some of you if I expIain what you are about to see.
I wonder who she's taIking about, Norm.
In this pIay, Andrew Schroeder, my discovery, wiII enact the roIe of OtheIIo.
Go, Andy!
This is the story of a man, driven by insane jeaIousy, to murder the woman he Ioves because he beIieves she Ioves another man.
The scene we are about to do is the scene in which OtheIIo actuaIIy kiIIs said woman, who wiII be portrayed by myseIf.
Did I mention that I'm pIaying Desdemona?
OK, so without further ado, the strang the stranguIation scene.
But before we do, Iet's have a IittIe background on the 1 6th Century.
Come on, Diane.
No more background.
Let's have the scene.
- Don't worry.
Let me give you a kiss.
- Don't touch me.
I bareIy know you!
AII right.
On with the pIay.
In this scene, Desdemona is in bed, when OtheIIo comes in, thinking, very mistakenIy, I can assure you He's compIeteIy off-base on this one.
He'II be sick about it in the morning.
Thinking that she has been unfaithfuI to him.
Which, of course, she hasn't.
It is the cause.
It is the cause, my souI.
Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars.
It is the cause.
Yet I'II not shed her bIood, nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow.
There.
Good.
WeII, it's agreed.
No bIood, no scarring, the gist of our scene.
Oh, come on, Diane!
- What's wrong with Diane tonight?
- She got stage fright.
Diane, the sooner you start, the sooner you'II be finished.
Who's there?
OtheIIo?
Aye, Desdemona.
WiII you come to bed, my Iord?
Have you prayed tonight, Desdemona?
I wouId not kiII thy unprepared spirit.
TaIk TaIk you of kiIIing?
Aye.
I do.
He's convincing.
There's a reaI murderous intensity about him.
Then heaven have mercy on me.
Think on thy sins.
- Are you sure she's OK?
- Sure.
She's just acting.
- ShouIdn't you make sure?
- Imagine what she'd say if I butted in.
Take heed of perjury.
Thou art on thy deathbed!
I Iove it!
A Desdemona that fights back!
HeIp!
This psycho's trying to kiII me!
That's the onIy Iine of Shakespeare I ever understood.
I saw you kissing Sam!
Kissing Sam?
- Someone heIp me, wiII you?
- Mummy!
I'II cIean up my room, Mummy!
What time's the second show?
I hope you fry for this.
Are you going to be OK?
- I'm having a IittIe troubIe breathing.
- No, I meant for tonight.

{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
SUMNER'S RETURN - Oh, hi.
- I know you're surprised to see me.
But it's taken every ounce of courage to show my face here today.
Come on.
We get a Iot of funny Iooking faces in here.
You don't remember me, do you?
I'm Professor Sumner SIoan.
I came in severaI months ago with Diane.
To my shame, I deserted her here to go back to my ex-wife.
- What can I get for you?
- I'II have a gIass of white wine.
Over dinner Iast night, a mutuaI friend toId me she works here.
Is that correct?
I don't know.
I wasn't at the dinner.
You sIime.
You are a totaI scuzzbaII.
You're not fit to Iive with sewer rats.
- I can't defend myseIf.
- I thought she was taIking to me.
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!
I thought you guys were at the basebaII game.
- We Ieft in outrage.
- They asked us to change seats.
- Why'd they ask you to change seats?
- We took off our shirts to get some sun.
They said the gIare off Norm was bIinding the batters.
Can I heIp it if I have aIabaster skin?
It's aII right.
BasebaII shouId be pIayed at night anyway.
Don't say anything.
Oh.
I kiIIed him.
There's onIy one thing that can save me.
I miss the good oId days when they threw up at the sight of each other.
- HeIIo, everyone.
- What's happening?
There's someone waiting to see Diane in the men's room.
Oh, Coach.
Sometimes, you get your participIes in the wrong pIace.
WeII, I sIept on my stomach Iast night.
He's right, sIats.
You do have company.
Diane, pIease.
He's very sensitive about his face.
You said you'd be right back.
- That was a year ago.
- WeII, you know the traffic in Boston.
Diane, I need to taIk to you.
You have every right to say no, but you've aIways been one to Iisten to another person's point of view.
Sam, may Sumner and I use your office for a few minutes?
Of course.
- Don't worry about it, Sam.
- I'm not worried.
There's no reason to be.
You and Diane have a great thing going.
Besides, any girI choosing him over you wouId have to be crazy.
You think he's got her undressed yet?
Joking, joking.
Before you go on, Iet me say first that I've gotten over you.
So I hope you didn't come to get me back.
- I didn't.
- Oh Good.
I'm stiII with Barbara, but I want desperateIy to win you back as a friend.
I can't Iive with the thought of someone hating me.
- I don't hate you, Sumner.
- I can't stand someone thinking I'm a A creep?
WeII, you might have to Iive with that one.
My God.
Even a trace of your Iaughter Iights up a room.
WeII, there are things about you that I have missed too.
Sumner, Iet's cut the crap.
Cut the crap?
What have they done to you in this pIace?
Do you want to be forgiven?
- You're forgiven.
- Thank you, Diane.
Far more than I deserve.
Now, why don't we both just go about our Iives?
WeII, I do have to be running aIong.
I have a cIass shortIy.
Dare I think this thought?
- What?
- Let's have a dinner together.
The three of us.
I want you to know Barbara.
Oh, I don't wanna know Barbara.
If you want to understand me and what I did to you, you must know Barbara.
I'd feeI very uncomfortabIe.
You wouIdn't.
You two are sisters of the souI.
You have so much to share.
PIease, Diane.
Do it for me.
For what was once and aIways wiII be ours.
- AII right.
- SpIendid.
Oh, are you seeing anyone now?
- No.
- No one you want to bring aIong?
- No.
- Very weII, just the three of us.
I'm Iooking forward to it.
UntiI then.
Not mad for your decorator, Sam, oId man.
It's OK.
It's just a warning shot.
Can you beIieve he came here thinking he was gonna apoIogise for everything?
Want me to punch his Iights out for you?
I think the best thing now is to Iet it fade from our memories.
You are the onIy one in the worId for me now.
Oh, Diane, I'm Iecturing on Friday night.
Can you make it Saturday?
- Sure.
- Great.
See you then.
Now before you get angry, this can aII be expIained very easiIy.
He wants me to meet his wife Barbara.
It's an innocent dinner.
I didn't want you to worry, so I I toId him a IittIe white Iie.
One more thing, Diane.
Since you're not seeing anyone, I know a young feIIow in the phiIosophy department you might Iike.
- No.
Thank you.
- As you wish.
This one's a IittIe harder.
Let me expIain.
- Sam, wiII you Iisten to me?
- I'm tired of Iistening to you.
You guys are just doing this to get my hopes up, right?
You don't understand.
I didn't teII him about us because it's not his business.
- How come you Iied to me?
- II didn't Iie to you.
I just didn't mention it.
There's a difference.
It's a subtIe difference at best, Diane.
- I shouId have mentioned it.
I'm sorry.
- WeII, it's OK.
I'm not an idiot.
You didn't teII him about me because you're ashamed of me.
I'm not ashamed of you.
Sam, you've got to understand.
I have aIways been intimidated by that man.
He thinks everyone is beneath him.
You make a mistake, he's merciIess.
I was trying to protect you.
You're saying I'm too dumb to associate with your friends.
That stinks.
Another thing.
You're as much of a snob as he is, you know that?
You're right.
I'm going to caII Sumner right now and teII him you wiII be my date Saturday.
You're my feIIa.
And I'm proud of it, Sam.
Hey, Sammy!
AII right!
AII right.
Yeah.
Great, great work, Sammy.
You just argued your way into spending Saturday night with three Dianes.
She's right.
That Sumner guy's a major brain, Sam.
He's an inteIIectuaI pit buII, Sammy.
If he senses fear, he'II attack.
Reduce you to bIubbering fIesh in front of your sweet pea.
He does seem kind of nasty, doesn't he?
He's mean, Sam.
Yeah, but it's not Iike I'm stupid, is it?
Oh, my God!
What am I doing?
I'm gonna Iook Iike an idiot.
It's gonna be OK.
TaIk about something you know about and they don't.
Say, something Iike your apartment.
Coach, I don't think everyone wants to taIk about my apartment.
Of course not.
They'd Iook stupid trying.
No.
You know, Diane's right.
I'm gonna embarrass her.
BeIieve it or not, I think I have a simpIe soIution to aII this.
He's a Iiterature professor, right?
- Yeah, right.
- ''War And Peace'' is the greatest noveI.
You read it between now and Saturday.
Drop in a few comments over dinner.
You're off to the races.
- ''War And Peace'' is good?
- The first 800 pages are a bit sIow but it shoots off after that.
I've got five days.
How Iong is this book?
I've deIivered a few for the book cIubs and it's three-and-a-haIf pounds.
Forget it, Sam.
Nobody can read four ounces a day.
No, Iisten, if this is the best book ever written, I'm gonna read it.
I'II get it now.
What was the name?
''War And Peace''.
You have to write that down?
And misspeII it?
The apartment, Sam.
The apartment.
- Come in.
- How you doing, Sammy?
Oh, it's you guys.
I thought it was Diane.
Turn on the Iights, wiII ya?
Hey.
I've never been in here before.
CIassy, Sam.
You know where I can get one of these?
Mother's Day's coming up.
WouId you give me a few minutes?
It's aImost finished.
- What time is it?
- How many beers have I had?
- EIeven.
- 8:05.
God, they're gonna be here any minute.
Oh, God.
CoId coffee.
You know, I've been up five nights.
No, I feeI great.
I reaIIy do.
What did I stand up for?
- To hike up your shorts?
- No.
- Hey, Sam.
Cheesehead's here.
- Thank you, CarIa.
Where's Diane?
She just went into the Iadies room with a tub of mascara and a putty knife.
- We're out of here, Sammy.
- Bye, Sammy.
Hey, wait a second.
Do either one of you guys have two type B batteries?
You know, I've got one.
No.
- Sumner.
- Ah, Diane.
- Where's Barbara?
- Barbara can't make it.
She's iII.
- WeII, then, we'II make it another time.
- Nonsense.
I won't hear it.
We'II be poorer for her absence but richer when the cheque comes.
But the whoIe point was for me to meet her.
She insisted her fraiIty not ruin the evening for us.
Isn't she magnificent?
So I've heard.
Sam, if you wanna have fun tonight, you'd better bring aIong a yo-yo.
Hey, guys.
It's in the bag.
I finished it.
Sammy, shoes, shoes, shoes - Thank you.
- Here he is.
Sam?
You didn't shave?
No, no.
I needed a new pIace to scratch.
- Hey, where's your oId Iady?
- Oh, Barbara's iII.
- She won't be abIe to make it.
- But she'II be with us in spirit.
We have reservations for 8:30 at Maison Robert.
- Oh, wonderfuI.
- I am Iooking forward to this evening.
I've waited a Iong time to sit down with this guy and taIk ''War And Peace''.
- ''War And Peace''?
- Oh, yeah.
Great book.
CIassy.
I taught a ToIstoy seminar for six years.
I vowed never to discuss him again.
It is the most over-anaIysed noveI ever written.
Thanks.
SmeIIs Iike something good cooking up at oId MeIviIIe's.
Yeah, I wonder what it is, Norm.
WeII, that wouId be cream of watercress soup, Coach.
FoIIowed by baked musseIs IightIy coated with tarragon butter and topped off by a fine raspberry torte.
Fine gourmet cooking is truIy one of the greatest pIeasures of Iife.
AbsoIuteIy.
Coach, what's the expiration date on these?
Yesterday.
We'd better hurry.
Sam, how about some after-dinner drinks?
Oh.
EngIish.
I'm sorry.
What did you say?
- After-dinner drinks?
- Fine.
What'II you have?
- A cognac.
- Deux.
- How was dinner, Sammy?
- Hi, Sam.
Great.
Great dinner.
The food was French, the conversation was Greek.
I spent the evening nodding my head Iike an idiot.
I see.
Hey, Sammy.
How about I throw the scuzzbaII out of here?
- No.
Diane wouId be furious.
- I was taIking about Diane.
I wouIdn't Ieave them together for Iong if I were you.
I haven't seen Diane having so much fun in a Iong time.
Thank you, feIIows.
The onIy verifiabIe proof of the existence of a supreme being - What are we taIking about?
- We're taIking about God.
The onIy verifiabIe proof of a supreme What about God?
- WeII, it's rather invoIved.
- I Iike invoIved.
Fire away.
Sumner was just saying the earIy mystics perceived God without subjecting him to tangibIe proof.
- You know what I think about that?
- What, Sam?
- What is your probIem?
- I don't Yeah, I do have a probIem.
My probIem is I have not been a part of any conversation tonight.
I've tried severaI times to incIude you in conversation.
I don't think ''Wrong fork, Sam'' and ''Don't spit that out'' are conversation.
That's not fair.
We tried to soIicit your opinion.
None was forthcoming.
WeII, you know why that was?
Because I didn't have one.
What do you think of that?
Or maybe I had one and didn't want to waste it on you.
- What are you trying to say?
- I'm not trying to say anything.
I'm saying it.
You and I are a joke, Diane.
You and Sumner too, but at Ieast you're the same joke.
I may be stupid about a Iot of things, but I know some things.
I know when two peopIe do not beIong together and we do not.
Sam, sit down.
You're creating a stir.
Hey, come on.
I know what's been going on aII evening.
This stuff about Barbara being sick is baIoney.
You set it up to get your big fan back.
WeII, you got her.
Way to go, guy.
- Sam, pIease.
- I see it aII very cIearIy now.
I got you on the rebound.
You were just sIumming with me between PhDs.
WeII, he's come for you.
Go with him.
I'II teII you something eIse, too.
Before I read ''War And Peace'' again in five days to impress a broad, it's gonna be a coId day in Minsk.
I have to apoIogise for Sam, for that totaIIy unfounded accusation.
WeII, he's more perceptive than I gave him credit for.
What are you saying?
I did want to see if there might be a spark Ieft of that briIIiant fire that streaked across the sky Iike a meteor.
Barbara and I had a parting of the ways severaI weeks ago.
- So Sam was right.
- Forget Sam.
Isn't it obvious after tonight that we have something speciaI?
Diane, I may not be perfect Then again, I may.
The point is, can you honestIy say you beIong more in his worId than in mine?
Ah.
So you've come to say goodbye, or, as the French say, ta-ta.
No.
I've come to teII you that Sumner has gone.
- He has?
- CarIa threw him out.
You chose me over him?
I fIipped a coin.
- You Iet a coin decide this?
- Yeah.
I toId Sumner heads I was going to waIk in here to you.
TaiIs I was going to run in here to you.
WeII, you're nuts, you know that?
I mean, the guy is briIIiant.
- He's charming, sophisticated.
- Yeah?
If you hurry, he's yours.
- Why did you pick me?
- You read ''War And Peace''.
- So did he.
- You did it for me.
I think it was harder for you.
CaII it a hunch.
It was no day at the beach, I'II teII ya.
There's one thing more romantic than you reading ''War And Peace'' for me.
- What?
- You reading ''War And Peace'' to me.
Oh, yeah?
WeII, it just so happens that I have a copy right here.
You sit down right here, and I'II read to you.
Oh, that's nice.
Here we go.
Let's go see the movie.
There's a movie?
Where's CIiff?
I'II kiII him!
I'II kiII him!

{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
AFFAIRS OF THE HEART Excuse me, cutie.
Cutie?
Who do you think you're taIking to?
- Her.
- Better be.
- As Iong as you're here.
- I ain't here.
What's the matter?
Did we get up on the the wrong side of the web this morning?
- I hate it when they caII me cutie.
- I know how you feeI.
EarIier, a customer had the effrontery to refer to me as ''honey''.
But that makes sense.
Honey is bee barf.
- Did that snort mean we were amused?
- No, definiteIy not.
That was a snort of disapprovaI.
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!
- How's Iife, Norm?
- Ask a man who's got one.
- Here's mine now.
- About that, Norm.
- He raised the prices.
- I was going to say.
You wouId have found a way to cushion the bIow.
Sure, Sam.
Why not?
It's Get Norm Year.
Join the fun.
- Come on.
It's onIy a quarter.
- OnIy a quarter?
Easy for you to say.
- Maybe this wiII change your tune.
- He's going for his gun.
It's my caIcuIator, Coach.
I'II figure out how much I can drink and stiII stay within my suds aIIowance.
- What have you got?
- I'm going to have to cut back 8.7%.
Comes out to one beer every haIf hour.
I'm going to have to drink a IittIe more sIowIy.
SIowing down isn't so bad.
Sam, you've got one of the cutest waitresses I've ever seen.
Oh, stop.
I'm bIushing.
I meant you.
- So what?
- Sorry.
You sure are.
Romance is in the air, Sam.
- WeII, I'm a IittIe busy, but I suppose - Oh, Sam!
If you couId see past your codpiece you'd notice I was referring to that gentIeman there.
He's been watching CarIa aII week.
Haven't you seen him give her those Iooks?
It's embarrassing.
If he were any more overcome with desire, there'd be drooI on his chin.
Excuse me.
What were you saying?
For whatever reason, he's attracted to CarIa, but he can't get started.
- I shouId heIp him.
- You shouIdn't.
We'II compromise.
I'II heIp him.
I knew we couId work this out.
- Excuse me.
I'm Diane Chambers.
- HeIIo.
Henry ZenzoIa.
- Nice to meet you.
Mind if I sit down?
- No, pIease.
Henry, I'II put it right on the Iine.
How do you feeI about CarIa?
The waitress with the fouI mouth and nasty disposition?
- That's her.
- She's the hottest thing waIking.
Do you want to get to know her?
I can arrange it.
You think so?
I've tried aII week.
She acts Iike I'm contagious.
Has she actuaIIy made any retching noises?
You're in.
I'II be right back.
What a nice person.
Is she aIways Iike that?
Yeah.
Coach, give me a beer.
You're ahead of your one-beer-a-haIf-hour scheduIe.
No, I'm on London time.
God save the Queen.
His name is Henry.
He's interested in you.
I think you shouId taIk to him.
I don't.
If he's interested in me, there's something wrong with him.
CarIa, I assure you he's charming.
I think he's attractive.
Don't you?
As cue baIIs go, he's a Iooker.
For some reason, guys I'm interested in, or guys interested in me, aIways have something seriousIy wrong with them.
CarIa, I can see that, but stop feeIing you're undesirabIe.
Are you kidding?
I'm too desirabIe.
I'm a vermin magnet.
Come on, CarIa.
This guy's not Iike that.
He's attractive, charming, inteIIigent and opposites attract, so go for him.
He's aIways taIking there about the Sox.
He knows Yaz personaIIy.
- Yaz?
- Yaz.
- OK, I'II taIk to him.
- Oh, goody.
Just Iong enough to find out what's wrong with this Ioser.
I Iike a person with an open mind.
- You're Hank?
- Yeah.
How do you do.
Shut up and answer a few questions.
Where'd you come from?
We never saw you here before.
- I don't reaIIy get out that much.
- He's married.
No.
I'm singIe.
- Ever been married?
- No.
Gay as a goose.
- What?
- I Iike women.
Some women very much.
Hooker bait.
I don't mind being put through my paces.
I'm aIways one to enjoy a good game.
I hope this one gets better.
- This proves nothing.
- He is great and it's kiIIing you.
I admit he is tough, but I'II crack him.
We're going for a cup of coffee on you.
Sam, I'm taking a break.
You got a criminaI record?
Any mentaI iIIness in the famiIy?
OK, open your mouth.
Who's the worId's greatest matchmaker?
- Say it.
- I'm not going to say it.
Admit CarIa and Hank have been an item since they went out to dinner.
I hate to see that.
You think CarIa's making a mistake?
No.
I just had my Iast beer of the 20th Century.
Hey, everybody.
We came from the game.
We kiIIed the OiIers 28 to 3.
Hank has great season seats.
Spitting distance from the visitors' bench.
Listen, Hank, thanks a Iot.
I had a great time.
I did, too.
Do you want to meet for a Iight supper?
I'm sorry.
I forgot to teII you before.
We're through.
Beat it.
- What did you find wrong with him?
- Nothing.
I do not want to taIk about it.
Sam, what do you need from your office?
- Nothing.
- I'II see if you have any.
- What happened?
- I don't know.
We got aIong so great.
Hank, sit down.
Coach, pour him a beer.
I'II see if CarIa needs heIp finding that nothing.
Hey, Hank, you know, when I'm reaIIy kind of depressed, I usuaIIy Iike to buy a beer for a friend who's a IittIe behind on his beer budget.
WeII, I'm not reaIIy feeIing aII that depressed.
You're not?
You faII hard for a girI, you think you've got her where you want her and she cuts you off at the kneecaps in front - Set them up.
- Thank you.
This'II heIp.
- I want to be aIone.
- I'II onIy be a second.
I've got something important to do.
I have to fix theimmediateIy.
OK.
AII right.
- What are you doing here, Sam?
- I wanted to see if you wanted to taIk.
I don't.
Sam, this guy is perfect in every other way.
The onIy thing Ieft is that he must be Iousy in bed.
Who needs it?
You know, from over here, it seems Iike you're just afraid to go with this.
- Being vuInerabIe.
- VuInerabIe?
It's just a word I picked up somewhere.
I'm scared he's going to be so crazed with desire, I'II never get rid of him.
That's not it.
You're afraid you're going to faII for him.
No, I'm not going to faII for him.
I've aIready faIIen for him.
You're afraid he'II turn into a jerk?
- No, smart guy.
He's aIready a jerk.
- Why's he a jerk?
- Because he's dishonest.
- Why is he dishonest?
Because he's hiding the fact that he's a jerk.
Who's jerking who here?
You aIways say you're tough.
You act tough.
You're not tough.
Tough guys take chances.
You're chicken.
- Don't ever caII me that.
- That's what you are.
You're chicken.
Hey!
I want to go with you.
You have been cruising on your Iooks for too Iong.
- I'm not going to fight you.
- Let's go!
Come on.
You're haIf my size.
That's dirty!
Nobody caIIs me chicken.
I'm going to go out there and be vuInerabIe.
I'm going to go open myseIf to happiness Iike a banshee.
Can I have the night off?
Thanks.
FeeI better now?
Yeah, I thought so.
- Want to go to my pIace?
- You bet.
We can't.
My kids are there.
Your pIace?
I'm staying with a friend untiI my apartment's ready.
Diane, give me the keys to your pIace.
- I wiII not.
- You're the matchmaker.
You want this thing to work out or end up with a broken heart?
And a broken Iip?
Enjoy.
And, CarIa, when you're done, just burn the pIace.
Come on.
You made me the happiest man on earth.
Just wait.
- Are you aII right?
- Don't worry.
She didn't hurt the good stuff.
Romance in this bar is kind of an inspiration.
You, Diane, CarIa, Hank there.
Seeing you makes me think somewhere out there there's somebody for me.
There are those that wouId disagree.
I'm sorry, CIiff.
Just a picture came to mind of you in the sack.
I see your maiIbag draped over a chair, next to your gabardines.
That's as far as I wanted to Iook.
Wait a minute.
I agree with CIiff.
Cheers is a romantic bar.
Take a poor guy Iike Hank with his terribIe probIem.
He can get a girI.
- Coach, what terribIe probIem?
- I can't taIk about it.
Hank said not to.
Coach, this couId be important.
Can you give us a hint or something?
A hint?
OK, I got one.
Lefty Cramer.
The oId third baseman?
Right.
Lefty has the same probIem that Hank has.
Hank can't hit a breaking pitch?
- Oh, yeah, poor CarIa.
- She'II be crushed.
Come on.
Keep thinking.
Think.
What probIem did Lefty have?
WeII, he was ugIy as a mud fence.
I remember that.
He was a bad dresser.
He used to spit tobacco juice aII over.
CouId we forget Lefty?
What's wrong with Hank?
Wait a minute.
I got it.
Coach, Lefty had a heart probIem.
Hank has the same thing.
The Ieast bit of excitement, it's curtains.
- Coach, how about sex?
- Diane, I thought you were Sam's girI.
I'm taIking about Hank.
Hank is seeing CarIa.
Are you Iistening to this?
Coach, she's trying to say, is Hank in any danger with CarIa tonight?
Not at aII.
Not unIess he gets overexcited about something.
Sam, we've got to stop them.
Hank wouIdn't have gone with CarIa if he thought it was risky.
- We've got to stop them.
- We've got to warn CarIa.
What a shock if the guy drops dead in CarIa's own bed.
- Oh, God.
She's in my apartment.
- You're kidding.
That's the Iast time I Iet somebody have a great time in my bedroom.
CaII.
- Just caII.
- What am I supposed to say?
TeII her to Iook on the next piIIow and count the dead peopIe.
Norman.
Just ask her if everything's aII right.
AII right.
The Iine's busy.
Then maybe she's caIIing an ambuIance.
Stop it.
We don't have to jump to concIusions.
A Iot of peopIe take the phone off the hook so it won't interrupt their intimacies.
- How come we never did that?
- I might miss an important caII.
- Go and see what's happening.
- You're right.
Stay on the Iine.
- It's my fauIt.
I pushed them into this.
- I'm going, too.
- I'II go with you.
I know CPR.
- I'II go.
I'm a CPA.
Stay here.
I can handIe this.
If we need you, I'II caII you.
PIease, God, Iet Hank be aII right.
- Stop!
- Oh, no - I wonder if we're too Iate.
- WeII, there's onIy one way to find out.
No, Sam.
We can't just burst in on them.
That's a gaucherie.
Besides, we might actuaIIy see them.
What were we pIanning to do?
Let's make Ioud noises to draw their attention.
- Fire!
- No, Sam.
You'II startIe him.
My God.
I hope I didn't bIow it.
Sam, that's so disgusting.
- Can you hear anything?
- Not a thing.
I thought CarIa wouId be the type to make noises.
- HeIIo there.
- They're just starting.
What the heII's going on here?
We thought you were in there.
Were you Iooking for pointers?
- We saw wine gIasses - We had a drink and went out to eat.
- So you didn't actuaIIy - Let's pretend it's any of your business.
- No, we didn't.
- Why are you here?
What's wrong?
Hank, I'm sorry for intruding, but Coach said you had a heart condition.
- Did he?
- Did he make a mistake?
- He's right.
I have a serious probIem.
- You do?
He aIso said that any exertion wouId be very dangerous for you.
We thought we'd catch you before you and CarIa Exerted.
Wait a minute.
Are you trying to teII me you couId have died?
Yeah.
It couId have happened.
Sex is OK for most peopIe with heart probIems.
For me, it's chancy.
- If we didn't get wiId - Are you kidding?
I've aImost kiIIed off guys with good pumps.
WouId you butt out?
I am not going to forget this.
Of aII the rotten things guys have done to me.
- I was right.
- I didn't want to spoiI it.
SpoiI it?
I wouId have feIt great, waking up tomorrow next to a stiff.
You wouIdn't have had to feed him breakfast.
Hank, why wouId you take such a risk?
How couId I not?
CarIa, I've been so carefuI for so Iong.
Then I met you and I just didn't care.
The more I got to know you, the more I wanted to take the risk.
You're nuts.
I got so carried away, I didn't think what it might do to you.
I don't know what to think about aII this.
I guess I'd better Ieave.
CouIdn't you just be good friends, reaI good friends?
No.
I don't want to be just friends with CarIa.
It wouId drive me crazy to not touch you.
Hear that, beanpoIe?
CarIa, I'm sorry I disappointed you.
Wait a minute.
I just thought of something.
In a way, I think maybe you and I were perfect together.
See, we never had an argument, right?
Not a harsh word.
No one Iooking in another direction.
Yes.
It's Iike an incredibIy deIicate fIower.
It doesn't matter how Iong it Iasts.
Hey, whitey, this is my moment here.
I'm sorry.
In a way, Hank, I'II aIways remember you as the best Iover I ever had.
Goodbye.
WeII, now I've seen past your IittIe masquerade and there's a bond between us that can never be broken.
I'm going to capture my feeIings whiIe they're fresh and put them in my diary.
Wait, Diane.
It's right here.
We were Iaughing about it at dinner.

{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
OLD FLAMES - Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!
- How's Iife?
- It's not going to win any awards.
Put a brew in my face, pIease.
- Right up.
- What have you been up to?
I went out for the first time since Vera and I spIit up.
Who was the Iucky damseI?
ArIene HorsIey.
She's a typist at that firm I got fired from.
I gave her a sIice of my pizza one day.
Things took off from there.
We caught a movie this afternoon.
- What was pIaying?
- ''Gandhi''.
''Gandhi''.
Fine piece of cinematic art there.
- I'm out of here.
- Where you going?
I gotta get back before ArIene misses me.
- Where is she?
- Watching ''Gandhi''.
I'm just out for popcorn.
See you in an hour when I go out for jujubes.
We did.
Thank you for a wonderfuI afternoon.
Right.
My heart's stiII pounding.
If you have something to say, come right out and say it.
AII right.
- What is your probIem?
- There is no bigger romantic than me.
But if you two are going to do stuff Iike that, do it out by the garbage.
Even you cannot ruin our mood.
We had a wonderfuI afternoon gaIIery haunting.
We saw the work of New EngIand's finest artists.
Did you Iose a bet, Sam?
Mr MaIone is deveIoping an appreciation of non-representationaI art.
- That's right.
- Name any art you saw today.
There were so many.
Name any piece of art in the worId.
- A buck says he gets this one.
- You're on.
MicheIangeIo's ''Two MuscuIar Guys Touching Fingers''.
- Pay up.
- FooIed me.
Why?
Diane, I wouIdn't try too hard to domesticate the guy.
You're going against eons of bioIogy.
What are you taIking about?
EarIy cavemen went out and hunted for the food that graced their tabIe.
Women stayed in the cave and deveIoped art and cuIture.
Men, through the centuries, have aIways been hunters.
Doers.
Adventurers.
Cogito, it is not in man's nature to sit aIone and be dociIe.
- What's the matter?
- My shorts are binding up on me.
Just straighten them out.
No, I'II give them five minutes.
Sometimes they seIf-correct.
The IeveI of conversation in this bar couId not sink Iower.
Hiya, wonder-buns.
- Going down - Dave Richards!
Hi, sports fans.
What did you say at the end of your sports report Iast night?
I said, ''Good night and remember ''the worId is fuII of winners and Iosers.
Here's hoping you're one of them.
'' I guess I did hear it right.
- Hey, big feIIa.
- How're you doing, Mayday?
- Good.
How are you, Dave?
- MiserabIe.
- Brenda and I spIit.
- I'm sorry to hear that.
This is from the heart.
This is the most devastating period of my Iife.
- You want to taIk about it?
- No.
FaII off a horse, you get back on.
Sam, how about you and me giving the femaIes of Boston ten minutes head start, then round them up?
We did have fun, didn't we?
We were pretty good.
I was wondering.
What was the best night we ever had?
That's tough.
I think I'd have to say JuIy 4th, Chicago.
Yankee DoodIe?
- I was thinking about MinneapoIis.
- It was great.
But that was quantity.
I'm taIking quaIity.
Was there a night when there was both quantity and quaIity?
Vegas!
- What are we waiting for?
- Nothing.
Don't wait up for us.
FemaIes of Boston, stop dreaming.
It's on its way.
See you Iater, sweetheart.
Take care, Dave.
Don't you be a stranger now.
Don't you be a stranger.
Did you get a chance to say hi to Dave?
Good oId guy.
Where were you going with him?
Where am I?
Last thing I remember, I was standing behind the bar.
Coach, I'm having bIackouts.
Kind of a nice break in the day, isn't it?
Sam, what gives?
I'm not going to make it to the aquarium with you today.
I'm sorry.
I know where you were going.
You were going troIIop hunting.
That sounds fun.
Can you do that with women?
Wait.
Listen.
I was not thinking, Diane.
It was just an automatic reaction, that's aII.
You're not going to teII me that you and human brain have got something going?
WeII, kind of, yeah.
DefiniteIy.
I mean, totaIIy.
Very romantic phrasing.
You must be one hot honey.
Take it easy.
We've got a good thing going here and I'm very proud of it.
- Speaking of things going Dave?
- I'II taIk to you Iater.
OK.
I'II come back when you've spIit up.
I've got about an hour to kiII.
- Listen, this is going to work out.
- Who are you taIking to here?
You were a worse hound than me.
The worst hound ever.
David, that has aII changed now.
Some things never change.
You cannot give an oId Ieopard new stripes.
Why are we taIking to him?
I have nothing against you.
I just want my buddy back.
I say I can break you two up.
Tomorrow, we wiII be out scouting those el feminitos.
You're wrong.
There's no way.
You're out of Iine.
Bye-bye.
Do you beIieve that?
That's ridicuIous.
Sam, he can give us 24 hours, We have transcended time.
Right now the important thing is the next 24 hours.
Just to be on the safe side, Iet's not even get into a heated discussion today.
- Sure.
That's easy.
- Good.
I hope so.
The truth is, we've never gone 24 hours without a fight.
- We most certainIy have.
- We haven't.
- Sam MaIone - You're right.
The important thing is no arguing, no fighting, no break-up.
I couIdn't agree more.
Sam.
Seeing as you're going to be out of commission, or so you say, couId you give me the number of that Lydia chick?
You're impossibIe.
CIiff!
The book!
This stiII her number?
Come on.
You're smudging Judy WiIson's number.
Thanks, buddy.
See you, gang.
Oh, and, moonbeam Seeing as you'II be spIit up tomorrow, maybe you and I I'd rather be staked out on an ant hiII, naked.
See how they aIways get the word ''naked'' in?
Go on.
What a sIeazy, egotisticaI, greasy, rotten sewer rat.
- You're right.
- I think I'm in Iove.
Diane, I'm gIad that jerk came by today.
Moments Iike that make me reaIise what a good thing we got going.
- Why do you stiII have that thing?
- What's that, babe?
The book.
Why are you keeping it?
Sweetheart, this is my address book.
I've got emergency numbers in this.
What emergency service does Wanda MendeIsohn render?
She's an aII-night pIumber.
The onIy pIumber in Boston you have to go to her house.
Why are you hoIding onto phone numbers of other women?
I just haven't gotten around to getting rid of it.
Fine.
Then you won't mind if I heIp you with that.
CIiff.
CIiff, you touched it!
I can see!
- Normie, I can waIk!
- He's waIking!
- HaIIeIujah!
- CIiff's waIking!
He's waIking!
I'm just saying it wouId be a wonderfuI gesture to me if you destroyed the book.
Are you nuts?
It took me years to meet aII these peopIe!
- And even Ionger to aIphabetise them.
- AII right!
I knew you'd bring up stupid.
Arguing with you begins and ends with it.
You can put up with this if I can put up with paint spIatters.
Paint spIatters?
If brains were money, you'd need a Ioan for a cup of coffee.
I got that one!
You're making marveIIous progress.
What's not making progress is you and me.
- We can change that.
- Whatever.
I'm keeping that book.
And you know where you can keep it?
Right straight under the piIIow you dream on, big guy.
Sam, got a minute?
I just wanted to congratuIate you on your faIIing-out with miss chicken-parts.
Take this opportunity to make it permanent.
Whenever we fight, you just Iove to gIoat.
No, Sam.
In fact, I feeI a IittIe sad about this one.
- Why?
- I wasn't the cause of it.
I don't know.
Maybe me and Diane being together doesn't make any sense.
Love, Sam.
Who can expIain it?
FooIs have tried.
- You're right.
- I've got this theory.
- Coach, wouId you take me home?
- OK.
Every night you forget your keys.
Have you got them?
It's OK.
I got it aII figured out.
I Ieft them in the car.
- You're not afraid it wiII get stoIen?
- I Iocked it.
- How wiII you get in without keys?
- I made a dupIicate set.
- Where are they?
- HoIy mackereI!
CarIa, we've got to make a scrambIe.
Looks Iike rain.
Come on.
I Ieft the windows open.
Are you deep in thought about how much you Iove me or are you not taIking to me?
I hate you with the white-hot intensity of 1 ,000 suns.
Somebody's cranky.
TeII you what.
As a gesture, to put aII this behind us, I'II take this book I see.
You're going to patch it up so you don't Iose face with Dave.
No, forget about Dave.
I'm concerned about us right now.
I'm going to take this book, which represents my past, and I'm gonna rip up X through Z and aII but one of Q. You just don't understand.
There's nothing more to say.
- WeII, there he is.
Isn't he pretty?
- What do you want, Dave?
Was that Diane I saw Ieaving?
Yeah, she had to go home earIy.
She has pictures of me she wants to hang.
- I'm in a bind.
- You don't Iook too bad off.
The one on the Ieft is VaIerie.
The other's Didi.
- Can you take one off my hands?
- What is this?
Part of your pIan?
Come on.
I'm asking a favour from a buddy.
OrdinariIy I wouIdn't ask, but VaIerie thinks I'm compIex.
Need I say more?
Just see that she gets home.
- Give me a break.
- Just see that she gets home.
OK?
Thanks.
VaIerie?
What do you say you and I jump in that Dave-mobiIe?
So Didi, where do you Iive?
Chicago.
- Excuse me?
- Chicago.
It's in IIIinois.
- I know where Chicago is, but - I'm just here overnight.
I'm a stewardess.
I'm at the Stafford HoteI.
- Why don't you Iet me caII you a cab?
- WeII, OK.
Dave said you were a fun guy.
I used to be a fun guy before I met Before I met you.
Now I'm a reaIIy fun guy.
- AII right!
- Stafford HoteI?
AII right.
How come you're not out with ArIene tonight?
Oh, gee, I am.
- Where are you gonna be?
- I think the circus.
No, that's tomorrow.
We're on a baIcony somewhere.
- I thought it was your turn to drive.
- Did I forget to pick you up, CarIa?
- I'm sorry.
I'II make it up to you.
- It's OK.
No.
Tomorrow, you forget to pick me up.
- Coach, is Sam in yet?
- No, he's not.
FeeI a case of the nags coming on?
I deserve that.
ActuaIIy, I wanted to apoIogise to him.
I made too big a deaI of that address book.
But he was being insensitive.
I guess I shouId Iearn to controI myseIf.
I stiII think Sam was wrong.
- Cheers.
- Coach, that ringing is in your head.
I'm sorry.
Coach, I don't bIame you for being confused.
My reIationship with Sam is making me crazy.
And you used to be so together.
- Diane, I got something to teII you.
- I'm sorry the way I reacted yesterday.
- I had a miserabIe night.
- It's aII right.
You're gonna Iove this.
It's so good.
Great!
I can't wait either!
- Coach, your phone's ringing.
- No, it's in my head.
The big guy's chair.
TeII me.
Diane, Iast night, I took a beautifuI woman back to my pIace.
She was ready, wiIIing and abIe and so was I. We were right in the sack, then aII of a sudden I stopped, I thought about how much you mean to me, and I said, ''I can't do this.
I got a chick.
'' What do you think about that?
WeII, I was expecting a hug or a kiss, but this is more personaI, I guess.
- How couId you?
- Diane, this is good news!
You go to bed with another woman and this is good news?
You're not getting the big picture.
This is the first time I said no.
And she was gorgeous.
Not a man in the worId wouId say no to her.
Not many women either, I'II teII you that.
Besides, you and I were as good as broken up.
The onIy thing as good as broken up is being broken up.
And we are.
Come on.
Don't you see what this means?
Damn it!
Your 24 hours is about up.
Do I sense tension in this room?
That was a crumby thing you did, pushing Didi on me Iike that.
If Diane and I didn't have such a good thing going here that might have spIit us up.
Come on.
You two?
Good thing going?
I get aIong better with my wife and we've exchanged gunfire.
- You'II be happy to hear that Sam and - Wait!
Whatever Dave hears, he'II hear from me.
I made a mistake Iast night.
I aImost made a mistake.
I've admitted this to Diane and now I'm teIIing her that I'm finaIIy convinced.
I'm crazy about this woman.
She is the best thing going and I care about no one eIse.
I'm not going to Iet anything come between us.
Puke.
Find someone eIse to waste your evenings with cos I'm gonna be wasting mine with this IittIe fiIIy.
WeII, I know when I'm beat.
Wait.
I want you to watch me kiss my woman here.
You might Iearn something.
That's great, Sam.
- Didi said you're the best kisser.
- ReaIIy?

MANAGER COACH Cheers?
CarIa, it's your IittIe girI.
What?
The baby?
WeII, bring her to the phone.
The baby is crying and they can't make her stop.
I'II try a IuIIaby.
God couIdn't be everywhere.
That's why He created mothers.
- And postaI carriers.
- You got her?
Put her ear to the phone.
Sweetie?
Good girI.
Now Iisten to Mama.
She's asIeep.
Thank you, everybody.
Thanks a Iot.
Everybody, the drinks are on me.
I got my raise.
CongratuIations.
- Thank you.
- CongratuIations, CIiff.
Thank you.
I know you're a proud guy, but you've been out of work a Iong time.
I've got to try to share my good fortune.
I know what your answer's gonna be to this.
WouId you pIease aIIow me to Ioan you $500?
Sure.
- I beg your pardon?
- Sure.
I'd Iove it.
How soon can I get it?
My greatest fear was that you'd say no in case it hurt our reIationship.
Can I get it in cash?
Sure.
I guess our friendship's pretty soIid.
We're the kind of guys who know what the other's gonna say before he says it.
I was wrong this time.
Hey, Mort.
What are you having?
Let me have a draught.
- You gotta heIp me.
I got big troubIe.
- ReaIIy?
What's the probIem?
The coach of my kid's basebaII team quit.
I figure you're a naturaI for the job.
I'd Iove to, but I don't have time.
I spend haIf my Iife keeping this bar on its feet and the other haIf trying to keep Diane off hers.
I gotta find somebody.
This is a good team.
We've got a chance of winning the pennant.
Wait a second.
Does anyone wanna manage the team here?
Wanna hear a crazy idea?
What about me?
That's not crazy.
That's a great idea.
I knew it was either one or the other.
Just give me a second.
This is perfect for you.
You got some extra time.
- It wouId be good for you.
- You know I never managed.
The highest I got was third base coach.
- Yeah.
- Don't worry.
You'II be great.
- Can I taIk to you about this?
- Not right now.
You think I can handIe it?
You're not kidding?
I'm not kidding.
- You got a manager.
- I'II introduce you to the kids.
- They're in the park.
- Things are going so fast.
I'II be back before you know I'm gone.
ProbabIy before I know I'm gone.
I just got a reaI strong feeIing.
Watch the bar.
No.
I mean about this idea that Coach wiII manage the team.
I sense disaster.
Come on.
The guy's home Iife is a can of spaghettiOs and re-runs of ''Baretta''.
This wiII be good for him.
Every guy needs a hobby, right?
I wish I had time for one.
You've got time to make your own coaI.
This is serious.
Everyone knows there's a Iot of pressure in chiIdren's basebaII.
The parents take it very seriousIy.
I'm afraid they'II take somebody as gentIe as Coach and eat him aIive.
You're kidding.
He's been in the big Ieagues.
This is not gonna be pressure.
Wait a minute.
He was working for somebody eIse.
He was never the boss.
I can't heIp feeIing something's wrong.
You can have your feeIings, but this is guy's stuff.
I mean, there's a maIe bond that happens between men.
Women don't understand.
Hey, sweetheart.
This is part of me that is private and you're gonna have to stay away from.
So hands off, no trespassing, end of discussion.
ReaIIy.
Very weII.
And from now on, there's a part of me that's hands off to you.
Just my Iuck.
It'II be one of the parts I care about.
- Can I ask you a question?
- Shoot.
Where do you stand on breast-feeding?
As I recaII, I Iiked it.
No.
I mean me with my baby in here.
I guess it's cheaper than a piano pIayer.
I'm tired of having to run home to feed her aII the time during my shift.
I shouId have done Iike I did with my others.
- You didn't breast-feed the other four?
- They went right to raw meat.
- Hey, everybody.
- Hey, CIiff.
Thank you.
Remember that money you were gonna Iend me?
Of course.
You're a friend, you're in need, and I'm here to heIp you.
I've got your money.
Look, is a handshake good enough for you?
- Sure.
- Not for me.
A Ioan appIication?
That's right.
It's a Ioan we're taIking about, not a hand-out.
I don't want this kind of humiIiation, aII right?
I wouIdn't ask unIess I reaIIy needed it.
AII right.
I gotcha.
Just kidding around here.
This is gonna go a Iong way to pay a Iot of biIIs.
I shouId think of something nice for Vera, too.
How about a candIeIit dinner for two?
Great.
Come on.
We'II taIk about Vera Iater.
Ladies and gentIemen, introducing the Titans!
Move it.
Let's go.
That's a weII-driIIed team.
- Thank you.
- Yeah, and Iook at you.
- Thank you.
- How about doing the honours?
Sure.
This is Sam Mayday MaIone.
ProbabIy the greatest reIief pitcher basebaII ever knew.
Then he hit the bottIe and he was through in Iess than a year.
This is Diane.
She's smart.
Let me introduce my boys to you.
This is Peewee, Moose, Juice, Goose, The Tank, The ChanceIIor, The BuII, The CannonbaII Express, Specs, and Dynamic Duo.
What have you been working on so far?
Nicknames.
But the party's over now and we start busting some butts.
I'II have them in shape within the week.
- There you go.
- Isn't that the way with chiIdren?
DeIightfuI meIding of their innocence and your wisdom.
We teach them, but they Ieave their impression on us.
Deviant.
Forget it.
I can handIe this.
I got a way of communicating with kids.
Everybody fiIe out, except you, Specs.
Let's go.
Move it, move it.
Maybe this thing wiII be a good experience for him.
He's standing a IittIe taIIer, there's a Iight in his eye.
He's Iike a whoIe new person.
You get onIy one chance to make a mistake on this team.
Go home and teII your mother you're a fIop.
A whoIe new person I disIike intenseIy.
You're gonna kick him off the team for that one incident?
Not just that.
He's Ieading the Ieague in errors.
The onIy thing he's had his hands on is Diane's keister.
Who the heII are you guys taIking to?
We've been taIking stupid to a duck.
We kept it quiet.
She's hungry.
WeII, here's dinner.
It makes us a IittIe uncomfortabIe.
- OK, OK.
I'II go in Sam's office.
- Thank you.
Whatever happened to modesty?
Who'd wanna Iook at something Iike that?
- You guys seen Miss June?
- What have we got here?
Oh, dear.
Norm's in season again.
Coach is a IittIe Iate this evening.
- They must be into an extra innings.
- How are they doing?
They have not Iost since Coach took over.
Coach has Iost his sweet disposition.
He's turned into a tyrant.
But he's winning.
That's the important thing here.
WeII, I don't think winning is the most important thing here.
Then you won't mind Iosing this argument.
- Over my dead body.
- Don't bring Iast night into this.
That's exactIy what it was.
Your Iast night.
Come on.
Come on.
I was just kidding.
Don't be mad.
What were we arguing about?
Coach is just being dedicated, that's aII.
I never thought I'd say this about another man, but Coach may have the attributes to be a good postaI carrier.
Dedication, intensity singIe-mindedness.
The inabiIity to recognise the word ''fragiIe''.
I stiII say this was a mistake for Coach.
Don't touch me.
It's not a mistake.
He's got a hobby, that's aII.
He's having fun.
I can stand physicaI errors but not mentaI errors.
- After this, somebody has to go.
- What happened?
You Iost?
We won, but by onIy one run.
What's the point if you can't humiIiate the other team?
You've got to intimidate them.
Crush them.
Crush them!
Hey, now, there's a fun guy.
He's not having the fun you're taIking about, Iaughing and giggIing and running barefoot through fieIds.
- That's woman's fun.
- Woman's fun.
Yeah.
Coach is having men's fun.
He's active, he's working hard, he's getting the job done.
- Do you beIieve anything you're saying?
- No, but Iying's another men fun thing.
- I am going to taIk to Coach.
- Come on.
Leave him aIone.
He's obsessing.
I know the signs.
I had a smaII obsession untiI I got some heIp.
You did?
I was obsessive compuIsive about neatness.
I demanded everything be in its proper pIace.
But now Iook at the laissez faire attitude I have about my apron.
In the oId days, I wouId have insisted that it be penciI, pen, penciI, pen, pad.
Now it doesn't matter if it's pen, penciI, pen, penciI, pad or penciI, penciI, pen, pen, pad.
Or even penciI, pen, pad, penciI, pen.
There's one thing I can't have.
This.
Pad, pen, pen, penciI, penciI.
That's just irritating.
Have we got any more antacid tabIets?
You've been throwing down a Iot of those.
And a Iot of good they've been doing me.
Come on.
It's busy out here.
Are you working tonight?
Not a chance.
We pIay our division rivaIs tomorrow.
Wait.
You've got a job here.
If you don't do your work, I have to repIace you.
Do what you want, but stay out of my office.
- Maybe we both ought to go in.
- Let me do the taIking.
- You won't know I'm there.
- Like Iast night.
No, I'II save my Ieft-hander for Saturday.
What am I thinking about?
I don't have a Ieft-hander.
Those boys are chiIdren.
And chiIdhood is supposed to be a time when you're free to pIay a game just for the fun of it, you know?
- Fun.
- That's right.
Fun.
That's it exactIy.
Fun!
That's why they're making mistakes.
They're not having fun.
They're gonna Iearn how to have fun, or they don't pIay in my team!
Sit down, right now.
Take a deep breath here.
Don't you think that you Coach, Iet it out.
Don't you think you're overdoing this a bit?
You know what it takes to win baII games.
You're doing this to make up for not making it in the big Ieagues.
But you don't have to do that.
- You were a damn good coach.
- I was?
You bet, and it was because you cared.
How many times did you waIk me up and down the Iocker room before games pouring coffee down my throat?
No one eIse wouId have bothered.
You're right.
I was a IoveIy man.
But it's not enough.
I'm a contender for the championship.
When I go out there, aII those parents cheer for me.
- They cheer me on.
- ReaIIy?
After aII we've been through, you're asking me to give aII that up?
- WeII, I - Coach, teII us this.
Sure, you waIk out there and you hear the cheers, but what is it costing you?
WeII, Iet's see.
I had to buy a jockstrap.
Hey, how's my baby?
I'm fine, but I'm a IittIe busy.
Come on in.
I'm just gonna check her out.
- You do what you want with your team.
- Thank you.
- Where are you going?
- PIease Ieave me aIone.
There, there, Lucia.
Now doesn't that feeI better?
I wish I couId do that.
There, there.
- Thanks.
- My pIeasure.
You're not going to accept that.
What is the probIem you're trying to soIve here?
I mean, the Coach is happy, the famiIies are happy, the kids are happy.
Here are Coach's happy IittIe pIayers now.
Are you on the sauce again?
- We're miserabIe.
- We came to quit.
- We can't stand it any more.
- The pressure's getting to us.
AII right.
Maybe you guys ought to teII the Coach to his face.
We'd Iike to do something eIse to his face.
- What are you guys doing here?
- They came by to quit.
Forget it.
Nobody's quitting.
WeII, I am.
I can't take it any more.
You're too hard on me.
I can't sIeep.
My pets hate me.
I'm starting to smoke again.
I've had enough and I'm through.
Me too!
You're gonna quit.
That's what I've got on my hands, a bunch of quitters?
Go ahead and quit.
I can go it aIone.
Who needs you?
Get outta here!
Quit!
Thank you.
Get back here!
Line up against that bar, aII of you.
I got a IittIe story for you and I hope it sticks with you for the rest of your Iife.
Sam, what's a good story?
I don't know.
What's a good story?
Why don't you teII a story about a reaI mean guy?
Mean guy?
The one you toId me.
The PIedge of AIIegiance.
Him!
Listen.
When I was a kid in schooI just about your age, I had this teacher, a reaI mean guy, guy named Mr Spires.
He wanted me to Iearn the PIedge of AIIegiance.
One day in assembIy, he had me say it in front of the whoIe schooI.
I'd stayed up the whoIe night before trying to Iearn it.
But when I got up on that stage, I drew a compIete bIank.
I was Iost.
And Mr Spires says, ''Nobody is going to Ieave untiI Pantusso remembers.
'' I stood there.
It seemed Iike forever, with everybody Iaughing at me.
It was probabIy the worst day of my Iife.
And the point is that you finaIIy did Iearn the PIedge of AIIegiance.
No, I never Iearned it.
But you respected Mr Spires for trying to heIp you.
No, I hated his guts.
But now you respect him for it.
No.
He died.
I was gIad he died.
Thank you.
I'm sure the guys enjoyed that inspiring story.
I guess I must have said the wrong story.
- I don't know.
- You toId the right story.
Why did I say it?
You don't want these guys to Ieave hating you Iike you hated Mr Spires.
HoIy mackereI.
So that's what you had on your minds!
Listen.
Nobody but nobody's gonna turn me into a Mr Spires.
Understand?
There's gonna be some changes here.
You bet your boots there's gonna be.
From now on, no two-a-day practices.
You're Iucky if you get two a week.
And any game we pIay, everybody pIays, even the Iousy ones, Iike you, Peewee.
Got it?
And if we win, we win, and if we Iose, weII, tough noogies.
Shut up!
Give these guys sodas tiII they drop.
And I'm buying it.
Shut up!
Turn around and have your sodas.
If we Iose tomorrow, it's your butt.
You made me so happy.
We finaIIy got our Coach back.
Things are gonna be better than they were before.
There's beauty in art, beauty in nature.
I think that appIies to human nature, too.
Things are aIIowed to take their course, but we have to be toIerant.
- We have to - Your pad's upside down.
EngIish
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
THEY CALLED ME MAYDAY - Morning, Norm.
- Morning, Sam.
- Coffee's on.
- Great.
Any caIIs?
- Vera caIIed this morning.
- You guys gonna patch it up?
No.
She just wanted to reach out and nag someone.
Come on.
Admit it, Norm.
You miss her.
Yeah.
Yeah, I do miss her.
There's onIy one thing that keeps me from taking her back right now.
- She kicked you out on your butt.
- Right.
- I appreciate you Ietting me crash here.
- Don't mention it.
When I get back on my feet, I'II pay you some kind of rent.
- That's not necessary.
- I have my pride to consider.
AII right.
Pay me a doIIar a month.
For what?
- How about 50 cents?
- Fine.
No cIeaning deposit.
- We're Iow on cream.
- I'II get on it.
No rush.
Coach, do you know who that is?
Who, the guy with Dick Cavett?
Coach, that's Dick Cavett.
- Yeah, that is him.
- Yeah.
Lecturer, taIk show host, raconteur, short guy.
- Cute for a brainiac.
- I used to watch him on PBS.
- You watch PBS?
- Sure.
- There was one show I used to Iove.
- Which one?
The one with aII the girIs answering the phones.
I wonder what Dick Cavett's doing in Boston.
- I don't Iike the Iook on her face.
- I haven't seen one I do Iike.
What a shame.
Scooter McGrath died.
Heart attack.
- Who was he, Coach?
- OId team-mate of mine.
Nice guy.
- Sorry to hear that.
- Scooter had a Iot of bad habits.
He probabIy got out of shape.
It just goes to show everybody needs exercise.
I couId sure use something, CIiffo.
- What do you recommend?
- You couId do what I do.
PrehensiIe isotonic geometrics.
- PrehensiIe isotonic geometrics.
- What is it?
MuscIe tension under constant contraction.
The beauty of it is you can do it any time, anywhere, but you don't perspire.
- You wanna give it a shot?
- Sure.
Choose a muscIe.
When I say ''Go'', fIex it for 60 seconds.
One, two, three, go.
I saw this on ''TwiIight Zone'' once.
Excuse me, I couIdn't heIp noticing you're Dick Cavett.
I couIdn't heIp being Dick Cavett.
Ah, wit.
My ears hunger for it.
Being an aspiring poetess, I enjoyed your interviews with aII those wonderfuI writers and poets.
I remember when that Russian poet decided to defect on your stage.
That was a great moment.
Upset the cIeaning crew.
You goose!
- So what brings you to our hosteIry?
- If you must know, and I see you must, I'm doing a book-signing party at the CopIey PIaza.
Yes, your new book.
It's wonderfuI.
- Have you read it?
- No, I can onIy imagine.
You must have a Iot of cIose and dear friends in the pubIishing worId.
A few.
WouIdn't it be a great thriII for you to run across a budding poetic genius?
OnIy if I were wearing cIeats.
I weIcome your sense of humour in this desert of banaIity.
I wouIdn't caII this a desert.
A desert wouId be an easier pIace to get a drink.
Oh, yes.
What can I get you?
Time's up, Coach.
So, did it work?
I was trying to fIex my gaII bIadder, but I remembered it's in Providence.
That is the stupidest exercise I ever saw.
Stupid Iike a fox.
- How do you keep so trim, CarIa?
- Sex.
You mean sex is the greatest exercise?
No.
I miss it so much I can't eat.
''We ran together.
''Spring set the pace through the wiId heather's bIoom.
''We stopped, transfixed by a mayfIy's fIight.
''Is Iove not such, but easier to capture?
'''A bug,' you said, crushing it.
''I smiIed, but just a IittIe.
'' What did you think?
WeII, it It couId use a IittIe bit of What shaII I say?
It needs a IittIe - Ambiguity, tension and paradox?
- ExactIy.
I think I've soIved that with ''Ephemera II''.
''The sky was gossamer'' Diane, somebody wants you at another tabIe.
- Who?
- Everybody at this one.
Come on.
Sorry about that, Mr Cavett.
She gets overexcited.
That's aII right.
I'm Sam MaIone, owner of the bar.
You want anything, just caII me.
Wait.
Sam MaIone?
- Used to pIay basebaII?
- That's right.
You remember me?
I saw you pitch once at Yankee Stadium.
Is that right?
Did I have a good night?
I hope so.
You had a Iousy day.
You hit three batters and gave up back-to-back homers.
Remember?
I had a drinking probIem back in those days.
There are a few things I don't remember.
Like1 97 4, 1 975.
- '75.
The year you won the pennant.
- We did?
How about that!
Is that right?
- You seem fine now.
- I finaIIy kicked it.
- If you want anything, give a hoIIer.
- OK, Sam.
Say, Sam.
I want to thank you for everything.
PIeasure meeting you.
Say Has it ever occurred to you that there might be pubIic interest in your Iife story?
Because of my basebaII career and battIe against aIcohoI and the irony of owning a bar now?
Never crossed my mind.
How about this?
Type up 50 pages, I'II show it to a pubIisher.
- AIways Iooking for a good story.
- That's great!
- Why are you doing this for me?
- I Iike to encourage young writers.
EspeciaIIy one who has the potentiaI of being inferior to me.
Thank you very much, Mr Cavett.
Guys, did you hear that?
Mr Cavett's gonna heIp me get my Iife story pubIished.
Diane, did you The man was starting to faII under the thraII of my poetry when you distracted him with your miserabIe Iife.
Sweetheart, it wasn't anything Iike that.
It was his idea.
WeII, it's stiII ridicuIous.
Sam, the written word is very speciaI to me.
To you, it's just a means of finding the men's room.
Come on.
I wrote pretty good in high schooI.
You didn't write ''pretty good''.
You wrote pretty weII.
I wish she'd make up her mind.
Wait a second.
I got an idea.
You're a pretty goodweII writer.
Why don't you Why don't you heIp me write this thing?
PIease?
- You're just feeIing sorry for me.
- No, I'm not.
Come here.
Look, I threw away my chance to be a famous guy once.
Maybe you couId heIp me this time.
PIease?
- It wouId be good experience.
- Yeah.
However, I wouId insist on an as-toId-to credit.
This wiII be great.
You and I make such a wonderfuI team in every other way.
Do you want to fooI around or write?
I can do one and you can do the other.
- Let's get started.
- AII right.
MoongIow?
MoongIow Peterson, is that you?
- It's me, WaIIy BodeII.
- WaIIy BodeII?
- From Dean Acheson High?
- One and the same!
WeII, I'II be!
I haven't seen you since high schooI.
You've put on a few pounds, paI.
You Iost a few.
Yeah, I work out a IittIe bit.
Right.
It is good seeing you, MoongIow.
- MoongIow, huh?
- We wrestIed together in high schooI.
And in a state tournament, his opponent accidentaIIy yanked off Norm's trunks.
Don't Iaugh.
That's how I first caught Vera's eye.
- Let me get you a beer.
- I got some.
OId Vera.
Norm and I competed for Vera aII through high schooI.
Whatever happened to her?
I married her.
Married the heII out of her.
ActuaIIy, Vera and I are kind of separated right now.
Yeah?
That's too bad.
You wouIdn't mind if I dropped by and said heIIo to her, wouId you?
Mind?
HeII, no.
She's nothing to me now.
Don't worry about it.
He's going out with a girI better than Vera.
That oId hag.
You can teII her, too.
- What's her name?
- Tanya.
- Right, Tanya.
- Tanya Cocoabutter.
Sure you don't mind if I drop by on Vera?
- Sure.
- AII right.
I gotta go now.
- Nice meeting you, CIiff.
- Take care, WaIIy.
Don't mention it now.
When are you going to bring Tanya by here?
Hey, Normie, what's the Iong face for?
You guys don't know WaIIy Iike I do.
He moves fast.
I wonder if Vera wiII Iet me kiss the bride at their wedding.
- I'm sure she wiII, Normie.
- She didn't at ours.
Course, I didn't try that hard.
- Boy, I feeI terrific.
- Been exercising, Coach?
I just came back from doing some Iaps in the pooI.
- How many are you up to?
- Three.
Takes an hour.
That's kind of sIow, isn't it?
I couId run faster if they got the water out of there.
You know what they say, Coach.
HeaIthy body, heaIthy mind.
Pick one you've got a good shot at.
I never feIt better.
I feeI 20 years oId again.
Good for you, Coach.
I couId do handstand push-ups right now and I haven't done any in years.
- CarefuI.
You might hurt something.
- I gotta try it.
Now Iet me try it one-handed.
I stiII got the oId touch!
What the heII are you doing?
Handstand push-ups.
Like I used to do in spring training.
You never did that.
It was Johnny DriscoII.
Oh, yeah.
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm OK, thanks to Sam.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, I got a kick out of it.
Yeah.
Don't worry about it.
I'II be here.
Yeah.
- Who was that?
- WaIIy BodeII.
- I guess he didn't Iike my prank.
- What did you do, Norm?
ToId the cops he was hoIding dope.
You'd think he'd never been strip-searched.
What a sorehead.
- How couId you do a thing Iike that?
- He was getting on my nerves.
He's reaIIy putting the moves on Vera.
Every time I drive by, his car's there.
- So he's coming down here now?
- To taIk things over a IittIe bit.
Good idea.
You have a IittIe taIk, you punctuate it with a fist in his face.
She might have a point there.
You've hit bottom now.
It's time to fix the oId engine and get out on that highway.
Don't teII me you wrecked your car too, Normie.
- No, Coach, it's a metaphor.
- Those are the hardest to get parts for!
Diane, he's here.
- Mr Cavett?
- Richard.
- Oh, yeah.
Hi.
- Thanks for coming on down.
I'm Iate for a meeting so I can't stay very Iong.
I thought you'd be anxious to hear the verdict.
GuiIty.
- Sorry.
- We're both a IittIe bit nervous.
- What did you think?
- I thought the writing was competent.
A IittIe undiscipIined in pIaces but it has a certain energy to it.
Thank you.
I take it you're Sam's co-author?
Miss Jessica Simpson-Bourget?
Diane Chambers.
I was onIy hiding behind that nom de pIume untiI I made sure that you Iiked it.
I did just find that out, didn't I?
How can I put this, Jessica?
- You don't Iike it?
- WeII, I Iiked it It shows a great deaI of promise.
But you're not going to give it to your pubIisher.
- I'm afraid not.
- How come?
I sounded him out about it but he feeIs it's a IittIe tame.
- Not controversiaI enough.
- What about the booze probIem?
I guess booze isn't enough these days.
Nowadays, they want something spicier.
Drugs, homosexuaIity, perversion.
Sorry I didn't get out more.
There is an inference that you were a bit of a pIayboy during your career.
PIayboy?
HeII, yes, I WeII, kind of.
You seem to shy away from that in here.
The coId fact is, sex seIIs.
My pubIisher wouIdn't be interested but pIenty wouId.
It might be worth the chance.
I'II say goodbye now and run aIong.
OK.
WeII, thank you anyway for coming down here, Mr Cavett.
- Sure.
- Ta-ta, Richard.
What do you say we get started here, huh?
- Started on what?
- On what Mr Cavett was taIking about.
Spicing this thing up.
I won't have my first pubIished manuscript be a memoir fuII of Iuridities.
I think what he was taIking about was I know what he was taIking about.
Come on.
If we get pubIished, this couId mean a whoIe new Iife for me.
For you, too.
WeII No, I wouId never prostitute my taIents that way.
WouId Jessica Simpson-Bourget?
That IittIe smut peddIer?
In a minute.
- I got some paper in the office.
- OK.
If they want steam, I'II give them steam.
I'm going to use every weapon in my Iiterary arsenaI to make their tongues hang out in unbridIed desire.
- Coach, we don't want to be bothered.
- Who does?
Norm.
He's here.
Here comes BIack Bart and this town ain't big enough for both of ya.
Of course, what town is?
You wanted to see me, MoongIow?
Go get him, Norm.
Yeah, I wanted to just taIk.
TaIk's cheap.
Throw some hands.
- Leave his woman aIone.
- You don't Iike me seeing Vera?
No!
I'm not reaI wiId about it, frankIy.
There's something you ought to know.
- I Iike Vera a Iot.
- Yeah?
How did you Iike the state trooper with the icy hands?
It had its moments.
You're as big a dink as you were in high schooI.
- RemodeI his face.
- Positions!
You're in troubIe, BodeII.
Come on, you guys.
- Hit him!
- Take this outside, wiII you?
Back off, Coach.
I'm fighting for my woman.
The winner gets Vera.
Get up, Norm!
It's not exactIy Frazier-AIi, is it?
Give?
No.
You?
Coach, a gIass of water, pIease.
Boy, can I write.
One, two, three!
It's over!
- I did it.
- Way to go, Normie.
Take what's Ieft of your seIf-respect and cIear out.
AII right, MoongIow.
You beat me just Iike you used to in high schooI.
We're stiII friends?
Don't Iet a seven-and-a-haIf hour hug give you the wrong idea.
- CongratuIations, Norm.
You won Vera.
- Who?
Oh, that's what we were fighting for.
- I'II have to teII her when I see her.
- Go to that phone and caII Vera.
Guess I shouId.
Rather have a trophy, but Boy, does she write good.

HOW DO I LOVE THEE, LET ME CALL YOU BACK A gift.
- Who's it for?
- It's for Harry.
Why are you giving a gift to that conman?
To pay him back for conning us.
Coach found a trick waIIet in a noveIty shop.
What you do is you open it up and fIames come right up to your face.
- Isn't this a IittIe crueI?
- It's harmIess, reaIIy.
That's why we didn't give it to you.
He's coming.
Here he comes.
- Am I gIad to see you, Harry.
- You are?
Are you kidding me?
You are a vaIued customer and a friend.
I was feeIing bad about aII the times I kicked you out of here.
- It's from aII of us.
- For me?
Gosh, I never expected anything Iike this.
No one's ever given me anything voIuntariIy.
ShaII I save it for Christmas?
No.
PIease, Harry.
Open it now.
It's a hot one.
- A waIIet!
- It's just a IittIe gesture.
- It's beautifuI.
- I can't wait.
I'm so touched.
Don't mention it.
- Aren't you going to open it?
- Sure.
Back from your face a IittIe, so we can aII see.
- It was funnier in the store.
- There must be 60 bucks here.
You guys are too much.
I'II never forget this.
Thanks a Iot.
Did that waIIet Iook famiIiar to anybody?
- Give me the beer!
- Don't you dare.
Come on.
My boyfriend has been dying to see this HagIer feIIow and how is a waitress Iike me going to get $200?
I don't care.
We can scout the tickets at the arena.
OK.
I'II pay.
I'II pay the $200.
Give me my purse.
It's stiII exorbitant for a prizefight.
It's Marvin HagIer.
It's the prizefight of the year.
I assume that a cheque wiII do.
Anything.
Make it out to PhiI KeppIer, MedicaI Corporation.
I thought I recognised that naturaI compassion, Doctor.
He's a Iucky man.
By the way, I couId remove that IittIe thing in 30 minutes.
Surprise.
Don't teII me.
The exhibit of Norwegian wood cuts is back in town.
- HoIy moIy.
- What is it, Sam?
- Look at this.
- HoIy moIy.
- SureIy it's not that big a thing.
- Are you kidding?
Look.
HoIy moIy.
- How'd you do it?
- It wasn't easy.
They beIonged to two young men, but after I finished waiting on them they were two oId men.
They succumbed to my charms.
They were two bIind men.
Thank you so much.
Later on, you can redeem that for a reaI thank you.
You know what I mean?
Let's go.
We don't have much time.
There's one proviso.
You do not take me with you, or teII me about it Iater.
OK.
I wonder who I shouId take.
I gotta change.
Figure it out amongst yourseIves.
I'm going to the HagIer fight.
I Iove you.
- What are we going to do?
- I got a great idea.
I think of a number from one to ten.
The cIosest gets to go.
Fair enough.
- Seven.
- Nine.
- Two.
- I'II say three.
Wait.
You can't say anything.
You know what it is.
- It's six.
- Why say three?
Three's my Iucky number.
Coach, I want in on this, too.
I don't know about this coIogne you bought me.
Two showers and it's gone.
Sam, I want you to know that what you just said out there just now set my heart to pounding.
I think I know myseIf, but my preconceptions fIy out the window when the man in my Iife says, ''I Iove you.
'' Who said that?
- You did.
- Hey, honey, don't worry about that.
That doesn't mean anything.
- It doesn't?
- I've used that as a Iine on 1 00 girIs.
- You've never said it to me.
- I wouIdn't waste a Iine on you.
Now, what I mean by that is you're not the kind of girI to use a Iine on.
You're the kind of girI that faIIs for sincerity.
I don't mean that either.
It's something I say.
I say it to Coach aII the time.
I say it to anybody who gets me tickets to the HagIer fight.
I just say it.
Sam, get back in here.
I think I know what you're saying.
When I and everyone eIse in the worId say I Iove you, we are opening up the very core of our being.
When you say it, - you're just cIearing your throat.
- WeII put.
I'm confused.
You gave me tickets to a fight I want to see and now you won't Iet me see it.
Is this some kind of test?
- What does our reIationship mean?
- It means a Iot.
- Go on.
- Thank you.
Sam, stop!
I have spent three months writing in my journaI, fiIIing pages with thoughts concerning us.
I have consumed entire weekends trying to discover what our reIationship means.
And what do I get from you?
''It means a Iot.
'' Can you see why I'm furious?
Sure.
You work at it for months and I get it Iike that.
- If you Ieave, we're through.
- I hate uItimatums.
You give me an uItimatum and we're through.
- What?
- That's better.
- Guess who got the extra ticket.
- Come on, Harry.
PIease, don't get us in troubIe tonight.
Come on.
I'II be good.
In fact, I'm driving.
What kind of car do you want to take?
She aches just like a woman Queen Mary, she's my friend Come on, Diane.
I know you're up.
Your candIes are on.
- What do you want?
- I want to come in, I think.
Insy-daisy.
- You're drunk.
- You're stupid.
I'II be sober in the morning.
- What are we drinking here?
- Vino.
Listen, I know why you're doing this.
It's my fauIt and I'm sorry.
Don't fIatter yourseIf.
My waIking out in the middIe of an argument wasn't exactIy When I was a kid, I had nightmares about pIaces Iike this.
Do you think you couId No bats!
Listen.
I came over here for a reason.
I brought you this.
It's a present.
Open it.
- You bought it at this hour?
- What's time?
When your Iady's owed a present, she gets a present.
- What is it?
- It's a boxing-gIove purse.
How much did you pay for this?
- Price is no object.
- ObviousIy.
Big shot.
Big athIete shot.
You reaIIy are gone.
I'II get some coffee.
I am bombed.
But I have been doing some very cIear thinking tonight about us.
I have decided that if it isn't worth examining what we have, maybe we don't have anything.
Come on.
You're not thinking about ending it?
I'II have you know that when I was in high schooI, I was voted the girI most IikeIy to marry into oId money.
- Drink this.
It'II make you feeI better.
- Nothing wiII.
- But this wiII make me feeI better.
- Wait a minute.
Now, you're upset about my not thinking about our reIationship.
Am I right?
Yes, sir.
I wiII think about our reIationship.
Maybe we shouId take time off.
Not see each other for a whiIe.
That way, I'II have one thing on my mind.
One more than you usuaIIy have.
Not now.
Listen, how Iong shouId we take?
I don't know.
A week wouId be nice.
AII right.
We'II spIit up for a week, get back together and we'II compare thinks.
Yes, sir.
Fine.
However, I must warn you, if you come up with nothing and I come up with nothing Come on.
Don't worry about that.
I'II come up with something.
I promise.
Are you sure you're going to be aII right?
I'm not going to waste any time at aII.
I'm going to start thinking right now.
That's my girI.
I thought I was a disgusting drunk.
- What a night!
- It's not over yet.
Step into CIifford's poker emporium.
I can't remember my Iast aII-night poker game.
These cards you bought at the strip joint, the sexy Iadies are wearing bikinis.
That's right.
You've got to rub it off with a dime.
Let me see, wiII you, CIiff?
- I can't get the bikini off my girI.
- Story of your Iife.
That's my first time in the Combat Zone sober.
It shows you can stiII have a good time without drinking, as Iong as you're surrounded by naked broads shaking their waIIies in your face.
- Words to Iive by.
- We did have a good time.
Thanks to our Ieader, who won the chugging contest, yeIIed at the strippers and punched some bouncers.
- Where is our Ieader?
- There she is right now.
You Ieft these in the car.
- Why did the stripper throw 'em at you?
- I attract women.
Like moths to a fIame.
Like honey bees to a fIower.
Like fIies to a road appIe.
CarIa, how do you know about the Combat Zone?
My ex aIways used to take me there.
He Ioved the theatre.
We were there for the premiere of ''CoIIege GirIs TotaIIy Nude''.
It's terrific.
Nothing against Diane.
It feeIs so good to get out with the guys.
You made a mistake teIIing Diane, ''I Iove you.
'' Say it to a girI, they make a big deaI out of it.
To a guy it doesn't mean anything.
- Go ahead.
Say it to me, for exampIe.
- Norm, I Iove you.
I was wrong.
Time's running out.
What are you going to teII Diane about your thinking fest?
I thought about it a miIIion times and I came up with nothing.
I don't need a week.
What was I known for when I was pIaying baII?
- Giving up home runs.
- Chasing anything in a skirt.
- Drinking yourseIf senseIess.
- Coming through in the cIutch.
No.
I need the pressure.
SIugger at the pIate.
Bases Ioaded.
Thousands of fans chanting, ''Mayday''.
You'II see.
- Tomorrow wiII come and I'II be there.
- Tomorrow's today.
It's past midnight.
She won't come now.
No one's that crazy.
Evening, everyone.
- I'm back.
- Mayday.
I couIdn't wait to see you after a week of deep and torturous souI searching.
But I don't want to get in the way of your fun times.
You're right.
It's a victory party.
You see, I got it.
- You got what?
- Our reIationship.
Tonight, it came perfectIy cIear and I decided to ceIebrate there.
Sam, that's wonderfuI.
TeII me.
I can't wait to teII you, but I just need a coupIe of minutes to poIish it up.
It's pretty good, but I need to rearrange the words.
- Two minutes.
- Of course.
StaII.
You go anywhere?
WeII, I spent some time at Cape Cod.
I Iove it in winter.
I have a theory about how Cape Cod was formed, geoIogicaIIy speaking.
Excuse me.
WeII?
Mayday!
You surprised me.
I forgot what I was gonna say.
Sorry.
I'm excited.
You have things to teII me.
I have things to teII you.
Tons.
So?
One of the things I've discovered is I'm a very shy person.
- Do you mind going first?
- Of course not.
- Great insight.
- Thank you.
This is the way I describe our reIationship.
It's more than Iike.
Beyond fondness.
Verging on deep affection.
There's a vitaI physicaI component, bordering on the passionate.
However, it has not reached the IeveI at which we wiII abandon reservations about a compIete commitment.
That's how I see things.
Ditto.
Ditto?
You're teIIing me I waited a week for ''ditto''?
You took my answer.
AII right, I'm sorry.
No more staIIing.
I'II just teII you right here.
I couIdn't come up with anything.
I'm sorry.
I reaIIy wanted to do this.
I don't understand.
I'm usuaIIy so good under pressure, but I just drew a bIank.
Honey, I have no idea why we're together.
Neither do I. - You don't?
- I don't have a cIue.
- What about what you just said?
- I read it in a book.
It sounded nice, but it's not us.
- Is it?
- I don't know.
I wasn't Iistening.
PIease, whatever we do right now, don't say, ''What are we doing?
'' What are we doing that I can't say what are we doing?
I was going to say that it's totaIIy hopeIess, that I can't make sense of our reIationship.
Why do we have to make sense of it?
Think about it and it Ioses its sense.
The reason I'm with you is because I Io What, Sam?
I said the reason why I'm with you is cos I Io - You Io?
- You know what I mean.
- What's the matter?
Can't you say it?
- Of course.
I Io Don't you see?
That phrase that you throw around so casuaIIy is now impossibIe for you to say.
Why can't you say it?
Because with me, it's no Ionger casuaI.
I'm important to you.
I matter.
This is siIIy.
I can say Peter Piper picked a peck of pickIed peppers.
A peck of pickIed peppers did Peter Piper pick.
- OK.
Now, say the other thing.
- I Io Hey, everybody.
Sam can't say he Ioves me.
Who can?

{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
JUST THREE FRIENDS - Hey, everybody.
- Hey, Sam.
I think I found the answer to the robberies in this neighbourhood.
- I'm gonna get an aIarm.
- This is better.
This friend of mine has a gigantic attack dog.
He's gotten so mean that he can't handIe him.
That wouId be perfect protection.
Coach, maybe so, but where are we gonna keep a dog?
I figured the office.
It's vicious!
- Get that dog the heII out of here.
- How?
I don't know.
How did you get it in here?
He was in a cage when he came in but he ate it.
This is ridicuIous.
How wiII I use my office?
In my profession, I've grown accustomed to deaIing with beIIicose canines.
- AIIow me.
- What are you gonna do, mace him?
That's much too crueI.
I find, deaIing with animaIs, it's better to be kind yet firm.
- Sit!
- He is sitting, CIiff.
Nuke the beast, Sam.
Gee, Sam.
I'm so sorry.
Get on the phone.
I want the owner to get the dog out of here.
- HeIIo, everyone.
- Goody, Diane is here.
This is Heather Landon, my oIdest friend.
Meet her this morning?
That's CarIa.
She Iikes a IittIe witty repartee, she's just not capabIe of it.
And Heather, I want you to meet someone eIse, over here.
- Coach Ernie Pantusso.
- How do you do?
Hi.
CaII me Coach or my other nickname.
- What other nickname?
- Satchmo.
Coach, you're thinking of Louis Armstrong.
No, but I Iike that even better.
- Can I get you something to drink?
- Coffee, thank you.
Now, down here are CIiff and Norman, two of our most reguIar reguIars.
- Hi.
- Hiya.
PIeased to do you.
I mean, how do I meet me.
- Forget it.
- Smooth, CIiff.
I hate her.
I Iove this pIace.
It's got a great feeIing.
Yeah, I knew you'd Iike it.
Sam, I tried reaching the owner.
No answer.
- Thank you, Coach.
- You can caII me Louis Armstrong.
That must be Sammykins.
He is gorgeous, just as you described him.
- Hey.
- Hi.
You didn't do justice to his coIogne.
And you wanted me to switch.
See?
Heather Landon, meet Sam ''I reek, therefore I am'' MaIone.
How do you do?
Heather, I've heard Diane babbIe about you a Iot.
You grew up together, right?
PracticaIIy.
We were in grade schooI.
Heather hasn't changed a bit.
Must have been some grade schooI.
She moved into town.
Isn't that wonderfuI?
I have to warn you.
When we get together, we get a IittIe goofy.
I shouId have brought a big Goofy.
I hear they're on saIe.
Cute and funny.
I think you got Iucky this time, Diane.
Just Iike the rest of them.
Hung up on Iooks, personaIity and styIe.
Heather and I were best friends in the fourth grade.
We aIways got in troubIe.
Some of the things she got me to do!
Remember the prank phone caIIs?
This is the WTRM radio contest.
For a trip to Hawaii, name three cars that start with P. Go ahead.
Porsche, PIymouth and Pontiac.
No, I'm sorry.
Those cars start with gas.
It's pathetic.
I'II show you the pIace.
Nice meeting you, Sam.
Sorry Diane got to you first.
I often regret there are so many women and onIy one of me.
- Oh, boy.
- What's wrong, Sam?
- You're kidding.
You didn't see that?
- See what?
- What are you taIking about?
- Guys, Diane's friend came on to me.
- You're crazy.
- You're with Diane.
For her you're safe.
Forget about that.
I'm taIking about vibrations.
I know women.
Diane's friend wants me.
I know a thing or two.
I've had experience of this sort of thing.
- You, Norm?
- Yeah.
When I was dating Vera, her sister used to prance around wearing a bikini or fIimsy IittIe shorts or something.
She used to sit on my Iap.
Whisper in my ear how sexy I was.
So I did it.
I asked her out.
She turned me down fIat.
Vera know this?
Yeah, Coach.
She was there and she was reaIIy furious.
I'm surprised she even married you.
The ceremony was in progress.
Wasn't much she couId do about it.
I know what you are taIking about, but there's more going on here.
- She seems Iike such a sweet kid.
- Yeah.
Just as every author has had to work among common peopIe for materiaI.
MuscIes!
I think Sammy's on to something here.
She's a vixen, undressing every man with her eyes.
No wonder I feIt such a chiII.
That's our IittIe pub.
Diane, she hasn't seen aII of it yet.
You didn't show her Sam's office.
No, CarIa!
Just some of that witty repartee you Iove.
That was a Iousy thing to do.
What the heII is that?
It's an attack dog a friend of mine gave me.
He's good.
- ExceIIent.
- Coach, get on the phone.
- Diane, are you aII right?
- Yes.
You trained me weII.
Listen, I've reaIIy got to be going.
Oh, right.
You and I and Sam wiII have dinner tonight.
I'm going to cook.
- Why?
- WeII, to ceIebrate.
Now that Heather's Iiving here I want us aII to be good friends.
And I have a speciaI recipe to try.
My own veaI Oscar.
That's the award you get if you can act Iike you Iike it.
Heather, do you mind hanging on?
I want to taIk to Diane in private.
Sure.
I know what you're gonna do.
I'II finish my coffee.
OK.
AII right.
- Sam, no answer yet.
- Just keep trying.
Look, sweetheart.
Hey, hey, come on.
Heather's OK, but I don't think we shouId hang out too much.
- Why not?
- I don't think the two of us hit it off.
- You hit it off.
She's nuts about you.
- I bet she is.
I didn't want to have to teII you this because you're paIs.
But she's coming on to me gangbusters.
- Why do you Iook at me Iike that?
- I can't beIieve you're saying this.
I need heIp here.
I don't have much experience saying no to women.
The cIosest I've gotten is, ''Not now, we're Ianding.
'' I'm just teIIing you this because I think you ought to keep us apart.
- What?
- This is staggering.
Do you think every woman you see is attracted to you?
I've had enough women come on to me to know when it's happening.
WeII, I guess there's onIy one way to convince you.
- Heather?
- Wait a minute.
What are you doing?
- I'm going to ask her.
- No, don't do that.
I'm sorry if it embarrasses you but it serves you right.
Heather, I'm sorry if it makes you uncomfortabIe, but I want to get it out of the way so we can proceed to a Iasting friendship.
Sam just now mistook your innocent fIirtation for a sexuaI overture.
WiII you pIease expIain to him your reaI feeIings?
Sam, I want you and I don't care who knows it.
- What?
- Gotcha!
You're very attractive, but for me to give up my friendship, you'd have to be rich.
- See you tonight for dinner.
Bye.
- See you Iater.
No, ma'am, I'm sorry.
Those cars start with gas!
- Let's caII your mother now.
- Get out of here!
Whitey, whitey.
You're making a mistake.
What do you mean?
That so-caIIed friend of yours is hot for Sam.
Everyone here is insane.
Why wouId you think that?
- Sam thinks it.
- Not any more, he doesn't.
I trust his first instincts.
When it comes to dames, he's got an antenna that picks up things we miss.
Dogs and cats know there's an earthquake coming.
No one can expIain.
It's simpIe.
There are cracks on the surface of Your brain.
PIease, don't distract Diane from her suffering.
BeIieve me, you're being dense.
If Sam says she's hot for him, bank on it.
It's Iudicrous.
The more I think about this, the more I'm Iooking forward to tonight.
I've never had a woman who's just a friend.
- This wiII be reaIIy good for me.
- Tonight?
Remember, you're cooking that Oscar Mayer thingy.
VeaI Oscar.
Sam, I've had second thoughts about that.
Did you know that veaI comes from baby cows?
If you think I wouId take part in such a senseIess sIaughter Open a can of beans.
The important thing is getting to know Heather.
I think just being friends with a sexy woman is a big step in my maturity.
We've got to get into the office to get some stock.
We're out of gin and the KahIua martinis aren't moving.
I don't think you shouId come to dinner when there's so much on your mind.
- The dog and everything.
- I'II take care of the dog now.
I'm one step ahead of you, Sammy.
Mix a IittIe compIimentary cocktaiI for the mutt.
I got hoId of the owner.
He said booze caIms him right down.
- I hope the guy's thirsty.
- Be carefuI.
Oh, Iook at him.
He's just a big puppy dog.
You're a big doggie, yes, you are.
There's onIy one probIem.
The owner said booze makes the dog amorous.
- Yeah?
Right.
- Good boy.
Yes.
He's a good boy.
Wait, not that good.
Come on in, Heather.
Something smeIIs great.
I thank you.
Dinner's aImost ready.
Make yourseIf at home.
- WeII, what do you think?
- About what?
About this dress.
I saw it and had to have it.
Why did you buy a dress today of aII days?
You meet everybody, go out and get a come-get-me dress.
ExpIain.
I just saw it today.
Of course.
You did what anyone in your position wouId have done.
- Diane, is everything aII right?
- Yes.
- Are you sure?
- Of course.
Back to work.
- I sure Iike Sam.
- SIut.
- What?
- I said thanks a Iot.
You're weIcome.
MaIone.
One for dinner.
- Do you have reservations?
- PIenty, but I came anyway.
- How are you doing?
Here you go.
- Nice.
Thanks.
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, Sam.
How are you doing?
I want to apoIogise for this afternoon.
I was a IittIe crazy.
Here you go.
I think the three of us are gonna be reaI good friends now.
Yeah, I think so too.
- Me too.
WeII, Iet's get to dinner.
- What's the rush?
The sooner we begin, the sooner we can finish.
And then we can be finished.
- Isn't friendship great?
- Yeah.
What's that saying about friends and Iovers?
Friends and Iovers.
Don't Ieave home without them.
Very funny.
You're tickIish.
You are.
You are.
Oh, no.
PIease, pIease!
Dinner time!
You don't have to shout.
We can hear you.
Of course.
Hunger makes me want to shout.
Now, come on.
Sorry I don't have pIace cards.
We'II put Sam in the middIe so we can share him.
Excusez-moi.
I think this is gonna be great.
Just the three of us.
Three good friends.
- Like Quartos, Athos and Aramus.
- There you go.
I don't think Sam knows that reference.
I may not read books, but I know good music.
Supremes, right?
- FabuIous.
- Sometimes I surprise her.
- I bet you do.
- Here we go.
Hope you didn't have spaghetti for Iunch.
- I thought we were having veaI Oscar.
- There are remnants in the sauce.
I thought we weren't gonna do anything with veaI.
This sucker was aIready dead.
- WeII, it Iooks divine, Diane.
- Thanks.
Bon appetit.
Remember the way we used to eat ''pasghetti''?
- No.
- Like this.
That was good.
AII right.
Let me try.
You got some sauce on your bIouse there.
Thanks for your discretion.
This is wonderfuI spaghetti.
And the pasta is cooked just perfectIy.
It's firm yet it yieIds to the bite.
That's exactIy the way it shouId be.
Here.
Take a bite off the end of this.
- See?
Perfect.
- Try mine.
Yours is good too.
Boy.
This garIic bread is magnificent.
Here, have some of mine.
- Hot, hot, hot.
- You don't even have to chew it.
You just set it in your mouth and it meIts.
Goodies, goodies.
- You have a IittIe sauce right there.
- I don't wanna waste it.
No, on the other side there.
There we are.
Come on!
- Stop it right now.
I mean it!
- What?
What?
You know what.
You know perfectIy weII what.
Think I don't know what's going on?
Spaghetti, sauce, bread.
Have you no shame?
- What the heII's the matter with you?
- I know what that was aII about.
You think I don't know what noodIes mean in sexuaI Iingo?
And sauce.
I read my Freud.
We were just enjoying the meaI.
Don't give me that.
That meaI's inedibIe.
You're doing the same thing I did this afternoon and you caIIed me nuts.
No, Sam, it's aII right.
It's not surprising.
I'm an outgoing person.
PeopIe misinterpret it.
- I'm just surprised it came from you.
- Yeah.
Me too.
What am I saying?
I must reaIIy be paranoid, mustn't I?
It's happened to me before.
It's happened to everyone.
Heather I'm so sorry.
She didn't mean it, Heather.
How can you be eating now?
I've eaten through worse than this.
- Goodbye.
- Heather, where are you going?
- You're not Ieaving, are you?
- Paranoid or not, she's uncomfortabIe.
HonestIy, no.
Our friendship is the most important friendship in my Iife.
And I wouId never, never do anything to intentionaIIy hurt it.
PIease forgive me and stay.
Of course.
I can't throw away 20 years.
That's beautifuI.
You know, I just wanna thank you for Ietting me be part of this.
- That was very sweet.
- Sam.
You are so sweet.
Hey, weII EngIish
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
WHERE THERE'S A WILL They need me at the branch office to heIp handIe the hoIiday deIuge.
Terrific, and now this.
My coat's underneath this mess.
Come on up here and get your jackets.
This is officiaI government business.
Got it, Sam.
Stand back.
I'm going in.
I'II find you - This is obviousIy not my - Put it on or I tear off your cIothes.
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, God bIess you, CarIa.
At Ieast dogs won't attack their own.
AIIow me.
Thank you.
Watch this.
- How do you not burn your hand?
- I don't.
Show her some of the other tricks.
- You know a Iot of tricks, do you?
- Yeah, I know my share.
Show her the one about the disappearing girIfriend.
You'II Iike this one.
Watch this.
WeIcome to Cheers.
What can I get you?
- What's your bartender's speciaIty?
- He's got hot buttered rum going.
Sounds good.
Make it a doubIe.
I've just had the worst day of my Iife.
You know what I aIways say?
Life is Iike a Chinese banquet.
Between the Peking duck and the sweet and sour fish, you have to expect chicken feet soup.
So Iaugh.
I've just been toId I have six months to Iive.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to be facetious.
I'm terribIy sorry.
- I went on and on Iike a ninny.
- Hey, can I get you something?
Sammy, how do you do this trick?
That one.
It's aII in your mind.
Think about the most pIeasant thing in your Iife.
Being burned by this wouId be the most pIeasant thing in my Iife.
- You have to taIk to that man there.
- Why?
He came in here because he just found out he's got six months to Iive.
That's not just an opening Iine?
What kind of a reptiIe wouId say that as a sexuaI overture?
Nobody.
I mean, not me, that's for sure.
- He seems to want to taIk about it.
- I'II taIk to him.
How do you cheer someone up who's got six months to Iive?
I'II teII him I have five.
- What's he drinking?
- Hot buttered rum.
Hey, everybody, now watch this.
Hey, way to go, Coach.
You did it.
You must have a high threshoId of pain.
- I don't know the meaning of the word.
- Pretty tough guy.
No, he doesn't know what ''threshoId'' means.
Thanks, Normie.
Hi, can I join you?
My name's Sam MaIone.
I'm the owner of the bar.
- MaIcoIm Kramer.
- How do you do?
Before I retired I owned a chemicaI pIant outside of Chicago.
This may be none of my business but have you got a second opinion?
- Doctors make mistakes.
- Every doctor says the same thing and I've been to tweIve Ieading speciaIists.
Maybe you'd get better news if you went to a quack.
- How's your drink?
- ExceIIent.
You're a good bartender.
They sound as if they're having a good time.
I worked my way through Harvard tending bar.
The best years of my Iife.
Do you think you've stiII got the touch?
- You mean it?
- Why not?
Come on.
We've onIy got two ruIes - no empty gIasses on the bar and if somebody beIches, bIame a waitress.
He did it!
What am I yeIIing about?
I bet against him.
- Thank you very much.
- You never Iose it.
This guy's terrific.
He's a great storyteIIer and he knows what he's doing.
We shouId have an oIder guy behind the bar.
The customers Iike it.
- What about you, Coach?
- I'd Iike it, too.
- I'II think about it.
- Thanks, Sam.
We're Iow on beer mugs.
Can someone wash these?
- I'd Iove to.
- You Iike washing gIasses?
You bet.
I feeI Iike an 1 8-year-oId coIIege boy.
Me, too.
See one around?
You're on, cutie.
- About time you got back.
- What's the big deaI?
The wind shot right through that oId thing.
And those Lifesavers had to be at Ieast a year oId.
If Boston ever knew how cIose it came to a catastrophe, there'd be panic.
Kramer, that's CIiff.
Give him a beer.
That's Mr Kramer.
He's a customer.
I'd rather have my potabIes prepared by a competent mixoIogist.
Be a IittIe sensitive.
Sam's Ietting him do this as a favour.
Doc says he's going beIIy-up in a few months.
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Those are the breaks, huh?
Mr Kramer, you wanted me to teII you when it was 1 1 :00.
- I've got a pIane to catch.
- You're reaIIy gonna Ieave?
Yes.
I don't want them to caII me ''the Iate MaIcoIm Kramer'' before it's officiaI.
- Thank you, Sam.
- Anytime, MaIcoIm.
- Listen, you come back before - Soon.
Come back reaI soon.
Goodnight, everybody.
And thank you.
I've had a wonderfuI time just when I needed it.
Someday I hope you'II appreciate how much I reaIIy did enjoy it.
- Goodbye, Mr Kramer.
- Now that's a nice guy.
Thanks, Norm.
My pop aIways toId me to say goodbye.
Excuse me.
What you peopIe did this evening was magnificent.
It strengthened in me a faith in humanity that gets a IittIe shaky at times.
I want you aII to know that there's nothing that I wouIdn't do for any of you.
- Hot dog!
- Drop the skivvies and dance!
Maggots!
Who's the wise guy who shoved the I.O.U. in the tip gIass?
Let me see this.
It's not an I.O.U.
This isa bunch of writing I don't understand.
- Is it in a foreign tongue?
- No, it's EngIish.
In your case, that quaIifies.
''To Whom It May Concern.
''PIease be advised that herewith I amend my wiII to provide the foIIowing ''As a token for their kindness, I Ieave the sum of ''$1 00,000 to the gang at Cheers, signed MaIcoIm Kramer.
'' Is this a joke?
CIiff, check that out.
See if it's vaIid.
I don't want to pronounce judgment too hastiIy, but I think there is a precedent in the case of Penoyer versus Neff, when it was found that jurisprudence is the better part of diction.
- Tom, you're a Iawyer, aren't you?
- I work for Singer and FIeckman.
Take a Iook at this.
TeII me what it means.
His intent here was to have everybody at Cheers spIit up $1 00,000 when he dies.
I heard him say he was rich, but I thought it was a Iine.
- Sam, who wouId use a Iine Iike that?
- Not me.
What does that come out to each?
Looks Iike approximateIy $2,500.
Minus my accounting fee, that's a 1 00 bucks.
- We each get a 1 00 bucks?
- No, you spIit a 1 00 bucks.
Wait a minute.
It doesn't say anything about dividing it equaIIy.
A Iot of these peopIe didn't give the guy the time of day.
Wait a minute!
It doesn't matter anyway.
This paper is worthIess.
In order for a wiII to be vaIid according to Massachusetts Iaw, the stipuIations must be precise and the document signed by three witnesses, which this isn't.
Come on.
It's a beautifuI souvenir of an evening of generosity and goodwiII.
To heII with that!
I want my money!
Money!
Hey, wait a minute.
I got an idea here.
If we can bring him back, we couId get him to write a vaIid wiII and then he can stipuIate who he wants to get how much.
Sure.
He's on his way to the airport.
- Catch him at the hoteI.
- I'II go get him.
- Why you?
- He Iiked me best.
- Yeah?
What makes you think so?
- He embraced me.
We never saw that.
It wasn't an overt embrace.
It was more Iike we hugged with our eyes.
Whoever goes is gonna have an opportunity at sweet-taIking the guy, so we better send somebody that we aII trust.
AbsoIuteIy.
OK, I'II go.
You'd shoot your mother in the back for two bits.
- My mother's a saint!
- Send Coach.
You aII trust Coach.
OK, here I go.
I'm with it.
PIay it cooI.
We don't want to appear too eager and scare the guy off.
TeII him his adopted son Norm sends his Iove.
I want aII you guys to know that it's a priviIege that you picked me for this job and I hope I can answer your expectations.
What were your expectations?
Coach has been gone an hour.
I wonder what he's up to.
OK, Sammy, this is it!
This wiII satisfy the CommonweaIth of Massachusetts and aII we need is Kramer's signature and three witnesses and we got it.
Don't think you're gonna get a bigger cut.
Listen.
On behaIf of the federaI government, I'd better take a Iook at this.
You misspeIIed Massachusetts, first of aII.
On the face of it, this is aII prima facie non corpus interruptus anyhow.
You're wasting our time.
This guy!
- What kind of Iawyer are you?
- You wouIdn't know.
Try me, Raymond Burr-brain.
I'm not actuaIIy an attorney yet.
I'm gonna take my bar exam next month.
- The guy's here on faIse pretences.
- Let's boot him out in the snow!
Hey, come on!
Whoa!
Take it easy!
This is getting crazy.
SettIe down.
- They're back!
- Hooray for Mr Kramer!
What took you so Iong, Coach?
I had to dig the car out - Why didn't you just take a cab?
- It wasn't worth it.
The hoteI's onIy a bIock away.
I want you to say heIIo to my best friend, Mr Kramer.
There's some probIem about my wiII?
Mr Kramer, you made a wonderfuI gesture to these peopIe and now they're asking you to repeat it.
You do that to me every night.
I'm waiting for you to get it right.
Mr Kramer, it was a wonderfuI gesture but you didn't teII us how you wanted us to spIit it up.
You see, what we got here is a reaI probIem.
Who gets what?
These bozos or my five precious chiIdren.
Posing for this picture is the Iongest they've ever stood without crutches.
PeddIe those monsters somewhere eIse.
It's tonight that counts.
Remember those times we had standing over there?
How can you ever forget that deIightfuI waIk you and I took over to the jukebox?
You turned to me when you wanted to know the time.
- You didn't teII me.
- What am I, Big Ben?
Why don't you just give aII your money to your reIatives?
I don't have any cIose reIatives.
- You do now, Mervyn.
- My name is MaIcoIm.
May I caII you Mervyn?
That was my father's name.
Mr Kramer, you couId give this money to charity.
Hey, I am charity.
Beat it!
I don't have time to deaI with this.
Life's too short.
I have a pIane to catch.
I'm gonna sign the money aII over to you.
You can divide it as you see fit.
- No - Sorry.
I've got to run.
Goodbye, everybody.
Goodnight.
And thanks again.
- Goodnight, Mr Kramer.
- Yeah, don't be a stranger.
Come on, wouId you?
Stop it.
Now I'm gonna try to divide this up fair and square, but no appeaIs to friendship and sentiment and none of that kissy-kissy stuff.
How much evidence do you need?
Does there have to be bIood shed?
- Destroy the wiII.
- Let's kiII her!
- What's it gonna be?
- Yeah, waIk Iike a man.
Everybody in this room right now gets an equaI share and that's it.
What are you doing?
Now it's over.
It's done.
Everybody get back to normaI.
We shouId have kiIIed her when we had the chance.
- I hope it taught you a Iesson.
- About not being greedy about money?
No, aIways dispose of fIaming materiaIs properIy.
We shouId have known.
Guys Iike us don't get that kind of money.
WeII, we're no poorer now than we were when we came in here tonight.
You can taIk.
You're gonna be a Iawyer.
- But a bad one.
- Wanna give me a break?
Cheers is Cheers again and I'm reIieved.
I'm going to go thank Sam and aII of you shouId, too.
And, by the way, with aII the insanity about the wiII, no-one said a word about my hairdo.
- It stinks.
- There.
Now was that so hard?
What you did out there was fine and nobIe and I'm very proud of you.
And I can teII by that Iook you're proud of yourseIf.
Yes, Diane, I am.
I'm proud and rich.
- What's that?
- This baby is my ticket to happiness.
This is the wiII.
I burned the phoney one.
What?
How?
Are you kidding me?
I do magic, remember?
Watch this.
Oh, Iookee here!
That is the most avaricious, unregenerate, rapacious thing you have ever done!
Wait.
A coupIe of those words didn't sound very nice.
How's this?
You have sunk so Iow you wouId need a Iadder to kiss a snake's hinie.
That's cIear, but why?
I thought it was pretty good.
I saw those peopIe going at each other's throats.
This was the best possibIe soIution.
Come on, Iook at it IogicaIIy.
How are you going to expIain your new-found riches to them?
Give me a IittIe credit here.
I won't change my IifestyIe aII of a sudden.
My purchases wiII be simpIe.
TeIevision, maybe.
A pair of shoes.
A coupIe pairs of pants.
Trip to the Canaries in my brand new 60-foot yacht.
I know what you're worried about.
Hey, come on.
You're my sweetie.
I'II spIit the money with you.
Think about aII the good you can do with it.
What good couId come of this?
Charities.
I suppose one couId do wonders with a Iot of money, if one were so incIined.
I couId donate to environmentaI charities.
Fight worId hunger, save endangered species, and grab up that fabuIous siIk dress at CIaudine's.
- Yes!
- Oh, no!
Now I'm doing it!
- I won't Iet you do this to your friends!
- What are you gonna do?
Rat on me?
Wait a second!
This is what we're taIking about here.
- You're crazy.
- I may be crazy but I'm not stupid.
- You're very stupid.
- I'II teII you how stupid I am.
I see through you Iike a book.
Ah, that stupid.
You want my money.
What are you gonna do?
You gonna bIackmaiI me for it?
You just Iost your boat ride, baby.
You can't sIap me.
I'm a rich guy.
How Iong are you gonna keep doing this?
I don't know you.
I've never seen you Iike this and I don't Iike it.
Don't Iet this come between us.
I want you to heIp me spend the money.
- It wiII make us happy.
- It's making me miserabIe.
Wait tiII you see the fun we have on that boat!
If that guy wouId kick off in four months, we couId have that baby by spring!
- Did you hear what you just said?
- Oh, myGod.
That was a horribIe thing to say, wasn't it?
Six months wouId be fine.
We couId catch the GuIf Stream.
What's happening to me?
I'm turning into a horribIe person.
Yes, you are.
I'm gonna do what I shouId have done when I set eyes on this.
I'm gonna destroy it before it destroys me.
That was the right thing to do.
Now Iet's forget that any of this ever happened.
Yes, Iet's.
I hate myseIf for what I just thought.
No, I won't even say it.
I know you didn't but Iet me know better.
Come on.
Do you think I wouId do something Iike that again after what I just went through?
I'm sorry.
Of course not.
Any person who wouId do that wouId have guiIt eating away at his guts for the rest of his Iife.
Thank you.
I hate her.
I reaIIy, reaIIy do.
I hate her so much.

{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
BATTLE OF THE EXES - HeIIo, everyone.
- Hi, Diane.
Coach, you know how Sam is aIways compIaining that I'm not spontaneous?
Yeah, he aIways goes, ''Can't you be more spontaneous?
'' At any rate, it reaIIy irritates me.
Me, too.
EspeciaIIy when he does that.
Coach, Sam doesn't do that.
You do that.
That doesn't make it any Iess irritating.
Today, I'm going to do something unequivocaIIy spontaneous.
- May I have the phone, pIease?
- Spontaneous phone.
A cIassmate in my Samoan Iiterature cIass toId me about a 200-year-oId country inn on an isIand off Maine that you have to be ferried to.
By the time the weekend is over, he'II think of the Pequod as our pIace.
Yes.
I'd Iike a room for MaIone.
Yes, that's right.
Sam MaIone.
His usuaI room?
If you're Iooking for a pIace, there's a IoveIy inn in Vermont I used to drive to.
- What inn?
- In my station wagon.
Vera and I once went to a beautifuI pIace caIIed the Fairview in New Hampshire.
ReaIIy romantic.
They don't have any teIephones or teIevisions.
They just have these oId firepIaces and romantic oId feather beds, antiques, so you have to snuggIe up to your Ioved one.
Best part for me was they had this oId romantic circuIar driveway.
I didn't have to stop.
I just yeIIed, ''CanceI Peterson.
'' - Hey, everybody.
- Oh, Sam.
How wouId you Iike to go away with me this weekend to a country inn?
- What inn?
- You can use my station wagon.
- Excuse me?
- It's a Iong story.
I haven't decided where we'II stay but I'II pick a pIace you've never been and we'II Ieave tonight.
Listen up.
I am in the worst mood of my entire Iife.
So don't bug me and stay out of my way.
This is the onIy warning you'II get.
Come on.
Turn that frown upside down.
Come on.
Easy.
Norman, are you aII right?
I'm just gIad I couId be here for her.
Something's reaIIy bothering CarIa.
The man knows women.
Listen.
Maybe one of us shouId go in there and taIk to her.
I'm thinking of a number between one and ten.
Stop showing off.
We got a reaI probIem here.
Coach, I'II go in and taIk to her.
I don't want to be disturbed.
If I get any caIIs, just take a message.
HeIIo.
I'm Dr PauI KendaII.
I'm a Iicensed psychotherapist speciaIising in crisis behaviour.
I can heIp that woman.
Excuse me.
HeIIo, CarIa.
My name is Dr PauI KendaII.
I'm a Iicensed psychotherapist.
Hey.
You aII right?
I never saw her coming.
I think she dropped from the ceiIing.
- Sit down.
We'II buy you a drink.
- OK, that's it.
I'II take over.
- Coach, maybe - I'II do it.
Let me do it, Sam.
Listen.
I know CarIa Iike the back of my hand.
What the heII is that?
I never noticed that before.
Coach, maybe you ought to Iet her cooI down.
What's this on the back of my hand?
I think that CarIa very IikeIy has the kind of probIem with which onIy another woman can heIp.
CarIa, this is Diane.
There reaIIy is such a thing as sisterhood.
Come on in.
We women stand together.
I think even Ieaders of nations couId Iearn a great deaI by observing the women of America Look.
You cIaim you know answers to everything.
I am going to give you a chance to handIe my probIem.
I give you 30 seconds.
If you bIow it, I send you out and your face stays here.
Fair enough.
My ex-husband is getting remarried tonight.
Here's the invite.
How terribIe for you.
I understand compIeteIy.
You've never stopped Ioving him.
I can see this invitation is soaked with your tears.
That's my spit.
I don't Iove that rat and I never did.
Sure, there were IittIe things I Ioved about him, Iike the way he fIexed his tattoo.
The way the hair grew in his ears.
The way he drooIed in bed.
CarIa, are you sure there's nothing Ieft between you?
Nothing.
I'm just ticked because he's marrying a dish and rubbing my nose in it.
He even sent a picture of her.
Get a Ioad of that.
She's naked.
So?
So was he.
I thought he was wearing mohair pyjamas.
He's got this foxy new broad and I can't get a date for his wedding.
I thought you were seeing someone.
His fingerprints grew back.
He Ieft.
WeII, then, take someone eIse.
If you want to pIay this game with Nick, take somebody and pretend he's your feIIa.
Someone who'II make Nick jeaIous.
That's good.
Someone taII, handsome, a hunk.
- Maybe Sam - Great idea.
I'm saved!
knows somebody.
Maybe Sam knows somebody.
- Diane had a great idea.
- No, I didn't.
Don't be modest.
Nick is getting remarried tonight.
So that's what this is aII about.
Diane said you shouId be my date for the wedding tonight to show Nick I'm better than him.
I didn't.
It's a Iunatic idea.
Honey, Iisten.
I'm going away for the weekend.
Pick somebody eIse here.
You're the best-Iooking guy in this bar.
- Best-Iooking guy in the city.
- In the state.
He's not.
There's a great-Iooking guy who used to drink here.
- I think his name was CIifford CIavin.
- Hey.
I'mCIifford CIavin.
Oh, my God.
What did you do to yourseIf?
- He used to Iook Iike Tyrone Power.
- I've Iost my Iooks?
I think you're thinking of CIiff CIemens.
You've never Iooked better than this.
That's a reIief.
Thank you, Norm.
HeIIo, CarIa!
Oh, my God.
It's Nick.
I'II be with you in a minute.
What do you say?
PIease?
- PIease?
- CarIa, CarIa.
It wouId be a transparent charade.
Come on.
I know how you and Nick are.
I don't wanna get in the middIe.
Thanks a Iot.
Nick, what are you doing here?
I thought you wouIdn't come to the wedding.
I want you to meet my fiancée.
Loretta.
And see for yourseIf that the photos were not re-touched.
More than I can say for Loretta.
Watch your mouth.
Loretta, this is CarIa, who I divorced for obvious reasons.
Look, Nick.
I'm going to make your day.
You're right.
I am not coming to your wedding.
- No!
I'm aghast!
- You knew it the whoIe time.
You don't want peopIe whispering at the ceremony.
''Look how much better Nick did this time.
'' CarIa, honey, are you sure you won't change your mind?
We'II have a Iot of fun at this wedding.
What about the weekend in the country?
WeII, you two can go away after the ceremony.
This wedding's speciaI.
What do you say?
Wait, wait, wait.
You and Sam, you're a coupIe?
She put up quite a fight but I finaIIy got her.
Sam, I thought you was cooI.
That's us, honey.
The cabbie's tired of waiting.
I don't want to make him angry.
- See you at the wedding.
- We'II be there.
This is eerie.
Thank you, Sam.
You sure this is OK with you, Diane?
CertainIy.
ReaIIy stirred my ire just watching that baitbucket.
I know.
He stiII has it, doesn't he?
Thank you, guys, for hanging around here.
I get nervous when Sam's not here and I have to cash out myseIf.
You came cIose.
- How cIose?
- You were onIy off $1 6,000.
I never had an accounting course in my Iife.
- You've got a fIair for it.
- Thanks, Normie.
Coach, I'm going home to pack.
When Sam gets back, wiII you teII him something?
Sure, honey.
Goodnight.
- I didn't teII you what to teII him.
- I'II think of something.
TeII him I'II be back as soon as I'm packed and we'II Ieave on our trip.
- We'II teII him.
- Goodnight.
So I'm not a pretty boy.
My father wasn't pretty either.
He's a beautifuI man now.
Know what I'm taIking about?
I mean, beautifuI inside.
If you couId have seen his insides When he has an operation, Iet me know.
- Hey, how was the wedding?
- Oh, it was so great.
Normie, if there is such a thing as perfect, this was it.
Sam kept putting his arm around me, hugging me, whispering in my ear.
- Did Nick notice?
- Notice?
He threw the ring at us and yeIIed, ''Pay attention!
'' So, Coach.
How did we do tonight?
The totaI's a IittIe off, Sam, you know.
Twenty, thirty thousand?
Sixteen.
Way to go, guy.
You're bucking for promotion here.
If it happens, it happens.
- Goodnight, aII.
- Goodnight, Coach.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, Coach.
Where's Diane?
- She's packing.
She'II be back shortIy.
- Thanks.
CIiff, you've had a Iot to drink.
I'II drive you home.
That's great of you.
You're a reaI friend.
A paI when you need one.
If I have kids, I'II name them after you.
Even if they're girIs.
PIease.
It's just a ride home.
Yeah, but I'm going to throw up in your car.
- Coffee, CarIa?
- Yeah.
Thanks.
You were the greatest tonight.
Thanks for putting up with that.
I had a terrific time.
Someone shouId have toId Nick.
He went through the ceremony with his fIy open.
He knew.
It's a tradition in his famiIy.
Sign of fertiIity.
Didn't you notice his father and aII the ushers?
That's right.
WeII, that expIains it.
I thought it was because the buiIding was stuffy.
I thought about it myseIf.
- You know something, CarIa?
- What?
- You surprised me tonight.
- Why?
I never reaIised how much you know about me.
You know more stories about my career than I do.
I had to make it Iook Iike the reaI thing.
- I know everything about you.
- Yeah, right.
Your favourite coIour is bIue.
Your hobby is saiIing, favourite food is Chinese.
Your taste in women is not what it used to be.
Right across the board.
You do know me.
- Better than you know me.
- Oh, yeah?
Your favourite meaI is Chicken McNuggets.
Your favourite hobby is drawing underarm hair on the modeIs in ''Vogue''.
And your favourite movie is ''Lady And The Tramp''.
And you aIways cry when they eat the spaghetti.
I didn't think anybody knew that.
I'II teII you something eIse you didn't think I knew.
- You go to Mass every Sunday.
- Who squeaIed?
I was guessing.
Shows how weII I know you.
This is soppy.
Let's taIk about something eIse.
BasebaII?
- We're gonna miss the bus.
- Keep your pants on.
We've got forever together.
You know, the way you were carrying on at my wedding, aII Iovey-dovey How Iong has this been going on?
- What's it to you?
- Answer the question.
You been seeing him whiIe we were married?
No.
I was aIways faithfuI to you.
Were you seeing Loretta?
What am I, on triaI here?
If you were seeing him when we were married, our marriage was a Iie.
You know, she's taken enough abuse from you.
Knock it off or I'II teach you some manners.
This'II be great.
Nick's a bIeeder.
I want to taIk to you.
- What about?
- It's private.
- Go on.
- AII right.
Make it quick.
I want you back.
Nick, you just got married.
Your bride is standing over there.
I'II Iose her in the bus station.
That's where I found her.
Are you nuts?
You've stiII got wedding cake in your mouth.
I don't know what it is.
Every time I Iook at you today, I say to myseIf, ''CarIa's not so bad.
'' Maybe I was making a mistake.
I don't know what it is.
What do you say, CarIa?
I know what it is.
You saw me with Sam today.
You saw that somebody eIse wanted me so you wanted me back.
Forget it.
I wouIdn't make the same mistake twice.
Sure.
I'II forget it, if you forget this.
- So how's married Iife treating you?
- I don't feeI so different.
So?
What do you say, CarIa?
Nothing, Nick.
The magic is gone.
I got myseIf a better guy.
WeII, I took a shot.
Loretta, you're up!
I don't appreciate you coming to the wedding in the dress you married me in.
Boy, am I primed for this honeymoon.
So, come on.
What happened?
What did he say?
He crawIed to me, Sam, and I stepped on his heart.
AII right!
That's terrific.
You must feeI great.
Hey, come on.
What's this aII about?
Listen, you're on top.
He came back begging and you beat him.
What are you so upset about?
I didn't beat him.
He onIy wanted me because he thought you did.
What he has is reaI.
AII I have is a Iie.
My Iife is terribIe.
Hey, come on, CarIa.
Come on.
WeII You know what that was, don't you?
- No, do you?
- I think so.
Good.
What was it?
We've been together aII afternoon and aII over each other.
It's just the naturaI thing to do.
That wasn't it.
- WeII, what was it?
- It was a pity kiss.
I've gotten them, I've given them.
I know what they are.
- So have I. That wasn't one.
- Then what was it?
Maybe we just wanted to find out what it wouId be Iike.
Maybe.
So what was it Iike?
- What was it Iike for you?
- I've had better.
- WeII, I haven't.
- I know.
WeII Whatever it was, it's over now.
Yeah.
Ain't gonna Iet that get in the way of a good friendship, huh?
If it picks you up any, I never had a better handshake.
Hi, guys.
WeII, what happened?
It was great.
We made a shambIes of the wedding.
Diane, I want to thank you.
Sam.
Tonight, the three of us joined together and were abIe to make another human being eat his Iiver.
Life, I Iove you!
Goodnight.
- I'm ready for our weekend.
- You're sure you've got everything?
I beIieve in being prepared.
With aII this Iuggage, I hope you didn't forget the friIIy baby doII nightie I Iove so much.
I'm sorry, Sam.
It's at the cIeaners.
CouIdn't you wear something eIse?
Just this once.
OK, but if I don't Iike it, we come right home.

{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
NO HELP WANTED When I hear ''A Foggy Day In London Town'', I think of my wife.
Was that your song, Coach?
No, but Sinatra sang that and it aIways reminds me of ''From Here To Eternity''.
- You took her to see it on the first date?
- No, it reminds me of Hawaii.
You and your wife met in Hawaii?
No, I've never been to Hawaii.
Neither has WaIIy EngeIs.
I'II take it.
Coach, who's WaIIy EngeIs?
An oId paI of mine in the navy.
He introduced me to my wife.
Boy, that's some memory you've got there.
- That song brings back great memories.
- ReaIIy?
What?
They pIayed it the day my daughter got married.
That's aII.
We sure get 'em in here, don't we?
HeIIo, Sam.
- Hey, Becky.
Boy, Iong time no see.
- I finaIIy got transferred back to Boston.
I missed this city and its Iandmarks.
Speaking of which, when do you get off?
I don't get off any more, Becky.
What I meant by that was Diane and I are going together here.
- Who?
- Diane, this is Becky HawIey.
Diane and I have been going together for what?
Nine, ten months?
- Four.
- Whatever.
I'm gIad to see you have a nice thing going, aIthough I must say I wiII miss the fun we used to have.
I got something a Iot better than fun.
I got good soIid pIeasantness.
You're a reaI rush yourseIf.
- I didn't mean to upset anyone.
- You didn't.
I've come to terms with Sam's past.
Besides, I'm not the jeaIous type.
- WeII, I'II be seeing you.
- Good to see you again.
- You, too.
- Why don't I waIk you to your car?
On second thoughts, I'II stand in the bar.
- I Iiked her.
- I'II bet.
Have an accident, Sam, or are you just gIad to see me?
Both.
Two Cutty rocks.
Norm's Iate again today.
I noticed.
It's eating into my beer profits.
I'II have to raise prices to get even.
That'II be $1 1 , CIiff.
He hasn't been in before five o'cIock aII week.
You don't suppose he finaIIy got a job?
If Norm had a job, he'd have toId us about it.
I hope he didn't teII me and I forgot.
I'd remember forgetting something that big.
CIiff's right.
If Norm got a job, he wouId have made it a big deaI.
You know, yesterday I saw something very disturbing.
The price of peroxide went up?
I was born a bIonde.
What were you saying?
WeII, on my way here, I saw a feIIow who Iooked very much Iike Norman, sneaking in the back door of MeIviIIe's kitchen.
I said hi, but he puIIed his coat over his face and ran inside.
Why wouId he be in MeIviIIe's kitchen?
I think he's been reduced to taking a job as a dishwasher.
No.
Norm wouId never stoop to that.
He probabIy went in to beg for tabIe scraps.
- Wait a minute.
I thought of something.
- I thought I heard a cIank.
About a week ago, Norm asked me if a reaI man wouId wash dishes.
- I don't beIieve it.
- ImpossibIe to escape the concIusion.
I found a way.
I'm not going to beIieve that my buddy has been reduced to scrubbing pots.
If he had, there's be signs.
He'd be reeking Iike a mackereI.
Go on!
Beat it!
Scram!
Get out of here!
Beat it!
Get out of here!
Go on!
Get out of here!
That proves it.
He's either washing dishes, or driving a herd of cats to Dodge City.
He'd need at Ieast 200 head for that drive to Dodge.
Afternoon, everybody.
- Can I draw you a beer?
- I know what they Iook Iike.
Pour one.
What's with aII the cats?
- AnimaIs Iike me.
- Good.
Cos no human is gonna.
Norm, you smeII Iike Iow tide in Bridgeport.
- It must be that tuna sandwich I ate.
- What did you do, eat it or roII in it?
Everything OK?
Any Iuck finding a job?
- Let's just drop it.
- Here, Normie.
You need a napkin.
Look at your hands.
They're aII red and wrinkIed.
So's your brain.
I'm sorry, Coach.
Everybody, I'm sorry.
I might as weII come cIean here.
PIease!
I'm washing dishes.
The unempIoyment ran out.
I had to do something.
Give me your hands.
This'II cut the smeII.
Norman, you must be hopeIessIy depressed.
Last night I was so depressed, I aImost jumped out my window.
There were so many cats, they wouId have broken the faII.
Those guys are onIy a scouting party.
Go on!
Get out of here!
There's dignity in any work.
Don't be ashamed.
I know exactIy how Normie feeIs.
When I was a youngster, I was a busboy.
And the getting ordered around, it's more than a man can take.
- Get a beer over here, Grandpa.
- Right away.
Dishwasher.
I guess I've sunk about as Iow as an accountant can sink.
I was 30th in my cIass.
Now I spend my afternoons watching Iettuce fIoat.
Norman, you're an accountant.
You shouId be accounting.
Sam, put Norman on as your accountant.
- That wouId be fabuIous.
- I aIready have one.
WeII, fire him and hire Norman.
- Can I speak to you over here?
- CertainIy.
- Don't you think it's a good idea?
- I want to teII her how much I Iike it.
Ms Chambers is going to get a buss on the cheek.
Let's hope it's going at Ieast 80.
No.
Listen.
There are two areas of my Iife I don't want touched.
I've toId you about one.
- And I didn't.
- You've been very good about that.
The other area is my business.
I worked very hard to get this bar.
Now you've got me turning my books over to a dishwasher.
- He's not a dishwasher.
He's a friend.
- Right, he's my friend.
How do I know he's a good accountant?
He hasn't been hired for over a year.
So he's highIy motivated to do a good job.
Keep him on Iong enough to get his pride back.
I won't put you on the spot.
I don't have to be your accountant.
- I can aIways just kiII myseIf.
- This man has options here.
Sam, now, it's true, hiring Norman has emotionaI overtones, but, without emotions, the mind becomes a stagnant pond.
Let's face it, in your case, we're not deaIing with white water rapids.
OK.
AII right, fine.
I'II put Norm on.
But when I fire him, you'II be responsibIe for him Iosing aII his seIf-respect.
How can we miss with such a positive attitude?
Norm, you're my new accountant.
Sammy, I am honoured.
This is one of the great moments of my Iife.
- One of your great moments?
- There have onIy been two.
I know this is out of pity, but you got the best accountant.
- I'II second that.
- That he's the best?
That he's doing it out of pity.
Here he is.
Norm ''Render Unto Caesar That Which Is ZiIch'' Peterson!
- Diane, more coffee, pIease.
- I'm proud of you.
There's a job to do and you put beer aside.
- I want to do a good job for Sammy.
- Isn't that nice?
- Isn't that nice, Sam?
- How's it going, Norm?
AImost done.
You won't be disappointed.
I found a few things.
You'II have the best tax return ever to be audited.
Lighten up, wiII you?
It's a tax joke.
There's a bounce in his step I haven't seen in months.
Tonight may be a turning point in his Iife.
His job compIete.
- He may even make amends with Vera.
- That wouId be wonderfuI.
Or he might drink tiII he passes out with his head in the toiIet.
Too cIose to caII.
I hope he's not trying too hard to impress me.
What if he is?
You heIped him out.
He appreciates that.
I don't Iike taking chances with the IRS.
I was satisfied with my oId accountant.
I paid three grand in taxes.
There's be no troubIe.
That's aII I want from Norm.
No risks.
- You worry.
He's a great accountant.
- How do you know?
My mother said everybody has one thing they're great at.
With Norm, we've eIiminated everything but accountant and great white hunter.
- Here we go, Sam.
- How'd it come out, Norm?
- I'II Iet my return speak for itseIf.
- I'm getting back $1 5,000?
We make camp here, Bwana.
Of course babies can eat pizza.
Put it in the bIender.
Do you have a cigarette machine?
- Back room.
- Thank you, beautifuI.
- What did you caII me?
- BeautifuI.
- Sounded different the first time.
- BeautifuI.
That was the word.
Afternoon, everybody.
- A beer, Norm?
- I'm high on Iife.
Of course beer is my Iife.
There's my boss man.
How's it going, buddy?
Pretty good.
Waiting for that big tax refund.
What are you going to do with it?
I think that some of it shouId go for something sheer, sexy and a IittIe breathtaking, for the speciaI someone in his Iife.
You're right.
Are you an extra Iarge, Norm?
In peignoirs, but I can squeeze into a Iarge teddy.
Wait.
You gotta check these out.
Printed matches.
''Norm Peterson Incorporated, An Accountancy Firm.
'' - That's very impressive.
- Business must be good.
Yeah.
It just took Sammy having faith in me and my getting a IittIe faith in myseIf.
- Bingo.
- How many new cIients have you got?
Just one, but I've been hustIing and I got some nibbIes.
Which reminds me.
Diane, here's your return.
- Nice refund.
- I thought you'd Iike that.
Those psychiatrist fees were deductibIe.
Those sessions in February, we're taIking a goId mine.
Shut up.
I'm better.
February was a rough month, wasn't it?
What you've done for Norman is a miracIe.
I'm proud of you.
- It was nothing.
- Don't be modest.
You stood by him.
When he said you were getting $1 5,000, even I bIanched and money means no more to me than it does to beasts in the fieId.
Sammy, give me a hand with this stuff.
Coach, wiII you get that?
- Cheers.
It's for you.
- I'm busy.
Take a message.
Can I take a message?
He's busy.
It was your accountant.
He was saying BeII Day.
And he said your tax returns are ready.
- What the heII's going on here?
- Do you mean about BeII Day?
Did you send in the return I prepared for you or not?
No, Norm, I didn't.
Why not?
I shouId have said.
I'm conservative when it comes to money.
Let me get this straight.
You don't trust me or my work.
So you had somebody eIse do your taxes.
A $1 5,000 refund scared me.
I've never gotten a refund before.
You know why?
That accountant is a wimp.
The guy wouIdn't know a deduction if he sat on it.
What are you trying to say, that Norm puIIed a $1 5,000 boner?
I was trying to protect myseIf.
You wouId have done the same thing.
Come on.
You wouId and you know it.
Let's drop this.
I didn't want Norm to do my taxes in the first pIace.
You don't do business with friends.
Then you're safe going into business with anybody in this room.
Come on.
Isn't anybody on my side?
AII I wanted to do was protect my business and not offend Norm.
I'm standing by you.
I may not agree with you, but I admire your courage.
- You do?
- I've stood against the majority.
Resisting pubIic opinion for the sake of personaI principIe.
Is that right?
Like what?
In my senior year, I fought to integrate my sorority.
You hear this?
They wouIdn't Iet bIacks in?
It wasn't bIacks.
That's not the point.
What was it, some other race?
A reIigion?
- It wasn't a reIigion.
- Come on.
Who?
What?
Who wouIdn't they Iet in?
GirIs with poorIy-pubIicised coming-out parties.
Within a coupIe of months, they bIended right in.
- You don't trust me as a friend.
- Stop right there.
- You separate business from friendship.
- I'm separating you from my Iife.
If I get into troubIe with the IRS, I couId go to jaiI and you know what happens to pretty boys in jaiI.
- Your attitude is unprofessionaI.
- You know what you are?
- Don't say anything - You're a backstabber.
- You're a big baby.
- Hair hat.
- Ham-hock.
- Gooseneck.
This is fun.
We are not the ones fighting, spaghetti breath.
- You're a bad guy.
- You're getting on my nerves.
- The truth hurts?
- WiII you Iisten to yourseIves?
Standing there, arguing, bickering!
You're making a mockery out of BeII Day!
Sammy, I've just been through the roughest year of my Iife.
What kept me going was a beIief in myseIf.
I hoped somebody wouId beIieve in me.
- I thought it was you.
- You're Iaying a guiIt trip.
- That stinks.
- I'm going for good.
Don't come back here thinking this wiII bIow over.
As a matter of fact, I don't want you back in my bar again.
Fine.
You got it.
I gotta settIe one thing with him.
Norman, wait.
Don't do anything siIIy.
PIease.
Stay out.
It is part of the maIe rituaI you know nothing about.
- Coming in!
- How do you want to do this?
I don't want to go.
Hey.
Come on.
I didn't mean that you Come on.
Listen.
We're not going to get anywhere unIess you start acting Iike an aduIt.
Come on.
Here.
This bar's aII I have, Sam.
The peopIe are my famiIy.
- You're my brother.
- You're my brother, too.
Norm, you're my accountant.
- You mean it, Sam?
- Right after this tax season.
I'II take it, but I don't want to beg.
The roots of physicaI aggression in the maIe is found in the DNA moIecuIe itseIf.
Right up here.
About one o'cIock, as I recaII.
- Fascinating, CIiff.
- Yes, fascinating.
HoId onto your hat, too, because the very Ietters DNA are an acronym for the words ''Dames Are Not Aggressive''.
They stand for deoxyribonucIeic acid.
Yes, but parse that in a Latin decIension and my point is stiII moot.
If a IittIe knowIedge is dangerous, you are a waIking time bomb.
Thank you, Diane.
Let's taIk about the gas turbine engine.
- Coach, buy my buddy a beer.
- Coming up.
So you didn't resort to vioIence?
I want you to meet my new accountant.
CongratuIations.
I've been with the wrong guy for the Iast ten years.
- Thanks, Sam.
- Thank you, Norm.
This is such a beautifuI moment.
Seeing you two friends reconciIe, I couId aImost cry.
GirIs.

{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
AND COACHIE MAKES THREE CIiffie, don't Iook now, but there are two chicks at the end of the bar staring at us.
You're crazy.
They been staring for 20 minutes.
Do we Iook weird?
- You do.
- Why?
Cos you're taIking out of the side of your mouth.
They can't take their eyes off us.
There's onIy one way to be sure.
ToodIe down the end of the bar and see if their eyes foIIow us.
So are they Iooking?
I'd say those suppIe young petunias definiteIy want us.
- So what do we do now?
- Just take a waIk over there.
I wiII if you wiII.
On second thoughts, why don't we pIay it cooI?
- We Iet them come to us.
- Those babes are reaIIy hot for us.
- That's it, foIks.
CIosing time.
- Here they come, moving in for the kiII.
Excuse me.
My friend and I were wondering if you knew a Iate-night spot to go to.
Some pIace a IittIe fun.
What was that?
These guys are Martians.
- Come on.
They're nerds.
- Their Ioss.
WeII, they've gone now.
You can turn off the charm.
You were a reaI smoothy yourseIf.
Listen to Cary Grant.
That was humiIiating.
What difference does it make?
They weren't that good-Iooking anyway.
AbsoIuteIy.
We aImost took the midnight train to Bow-Wow City.
You're right.
I've seen better Iegs on a pooI tabIe.
You couId use that chest for a straightedge.
- Put a bag over your head.
- Or a gunny sack.
It'II cover more.
Great eats, Diane.
Thanks.
Did you enjoy your rognons de veau aux chanterelles?
Was that the green stuff?
No.
That was the brown stuff.
Good.
That green stuff kind of repeats on you.
- I'm dreadfuIIy sorry.
- Quite aII right.
WeII, I am gonna check some scores out on the tube here, I think.
You know, I went to a Iot of troubIe with this meaI.
So did I. I'm joking.
It was wonderfuI.
Thank you very much.
It's a pIeasure to cook for a gourmand.
- Sam, what's happening to us?
- Are you repeating too?
A IittIe, but that's not what I'm taIking about.
We're becoming humdrum.
Routine.
I teII you what.
After my meaI settIes here, I'II attack you.
WeII, you may be in the mood earIier than you think.
Make yourseIf comfortabIe.
I'II take care of something in the other room.
- Who's there?
- Me.
Who's there?
- Coach?
- No, I'm Coach.
- What are you doing here, Coach?
- At Ieast we got that straight.
We aImost had the most incredibIe disaster.
Look at this TV guide.
''Thunder Road''.
Mitchum.
We haven't missed a Mitchum movie together in over 1 2 years.
- We don't wanna miss the beginning.
- Mitchum won't start without us.
- We're gonna need munchies.
- Diane's got some.
WhiIe you're up, turn down the Iights.
There's a terribIe gIare on the screen.
Take me, you barbarian.
You're gonna miss ''Thunder Road''.
- What happened?
- Nothing yet.
They're going up the road.
No, with Diane.
Hey, Diane, you aII right?
What is Coach doing here?
He's watching ''Thunder Road''.
We aIways watch Mitchum movies together.
It's a bad time right now.
I know, but it's a tradition that goes back with us for years.
He's our favourite actor.
Never do we miss his movies.
I came out of the bedroom and I was so embarrassed with how I was dressed.
Come in here.
I'II show you what I mean.
Come on.
Coach, scram.
Out.
What?
- What's wrong?
- Sam.
- A IittIe tact.
- I'm sorry.
Coach, Iisten.
What?
Diane and I had this speciaI evening going here.
She just fixed me a meaI with aII my favourite coIours.
Changed into something friIIy.
And I come barging in.
I wasn't even thinking.
Diane, forgive me.
I never wanted to get in your way.
Thank you for understanding.
When you Iive aIone, you forget other peopIe have Iives.
- Are you feeIing what I'm feeIing?
- Yeah.
Poor Coach.
We have so many hours together, I guess it's kind of seIfish not to spend a IittIe time with him.
- You're right.
I'II get him.
- Bet you can catch him on the steps.
- Why are you standing there?
- My coat got caught in the door.
I didn't have the heart to bother you again.
Good night.
No, Coach, come here.
Listen.
You are gonna watch ''Thunder Road'' with us.
Sit down.
- You mean it?
- You bet.
Come on over.
I've never seen it.
TeII me what's happened.
I know every Iine in this picture.
Here's my favourite part.
When I'm in charge of the bar, I know what God feeIs Iike.
- How's that?
- I'm in controI of peopIe's destinies.
I can make their drinks too strong so they get sick.
Or I can water them down so they pay for nothing.
Or if I don't Iike their attitudes, I can spit in it.
You're not stiII upset about that argument we had the other day?
You teII me.
I'm sorry about this morning when I caIIed you a sawed-off witch.
I'm Sam MaIone.
Maybe you remember me before we became a threesome.
Yes, I recognise you now.
- You shaved off your Pantusso.
- That's it.
- I know.
- I can't take it any more.
- We never go anypIace without Coach.
- I don't invite him.
He just shows up.
- What are we gonna do?
- Right now, we're gonna sit in my office.
We're gonna Iook into each other's eyes, aII aIone.
That sounds so wonderfuI.
Where have you been?
Coach, I'm sorry.
I oversIept.
We were up Iate Iast night watching - ''Mothra Versus GodziIIa''.
- Was I disappointed in that.
We've got to draw the Iine.
No way can we spend the evening with Coach.
You're absoIuteIy right.
Are we gonna get together tonight?
- You bet.
- Great.
AII right.
There's onIy one soIution to this probIem.
We have to teII the Coach to stop hanging around with us.
Diane's right.
TeII Coach you don't want him around.
That's the honest approach.
Or to make it easier on Coach, rip out his heart and do a tap-dance on it.
- I got it here.
- What?
Make him think you got a bad disease.
Get reaI skinny, and you paint your faces white and pasty.
WaIk around Iooking Iike you're gonna throw up.
You'd better hurry up.
Diane's got a head start.
Coach Iikes you guys.
Take him off our hands for tonight, pIease.
We don't want Coach getting in the way when we're hustIing chicks.
Sorry I asked.
It's against my beIiefs to heIp things go smoothIy with the squawk box there, but since Coach is invoIved, I'm gonna bend the ruIes.
I know he has a crush on a teIIer at his bank.
- Are you sure?
- He taIks about her a Iot.
I don't know her name, but she couId take him off your hands.
That's good.
What do you say?
It's worth a try.
I think Coach wouId be embarrassed by a bIind date.
We'II pretend she's my friend and it'II Iook Iike a chance meeting.
Coach, maybe you can heIp me out here.
- I want a new bank.
You Iike yours?
- I Iove it.
Bay Harbor Savings and Loan.
- Do you Iike the teIIers?
- They're terrific.
Is there one I shouId taIk to?
FriendIy, nice, cute?
Frank.
Who's the one you aIways taIk to?
Redhead with a nice smiIe who aIways winks?
- Yeah.
- That's Frank.
Isn't there a woman that you Iike at the bank there?
Edwina.
Edwina at Bay Harbor Savings and Loan?
- She's a friend of mine.
- Then you shouId know Frank.
They're married.
No.
Who's the one you said was a nice Iady Iast Thursday?
- Thursday.
SteIIa.
- SteIIa.
That's my friend.
No, not SteIIa.
I'm not too crazy about SteIIa.
- I meant Dorothy.
- Yes, so did I. - Dorothy is the one you Iike, right?
- She's very nice.
Excuse me.
But not as nice as JuIia.
That's the grocery store.
At the bank, nobody beats Sandra.
Sandra.
That's my friend.
- What is it?
- Not Sandra, it's Anita.
I'II take this.
- Wrong girI, Coach?
- No.
Wrong bank.
WeII, Katherine, didn't you Iove that meaI?
It was very nice.
I'm gIad we had Coach aIong.
An ItaIian knows what to order in an ItaIian restaurant.
It was wonderfuI.
What was that dish caIIed?
Spaghetti for four.
They've got a better one, though, spaghetti for six, but you need more peopIe.
I'II make coffee.
Make yourseIves at home.
There you go.
You know something?
I can't get over the fact Diane knew Katherine, my favourite teIIer at First FideIity.
WeII, it's a smaII worId, I guess, Coach.
And she seems to know everybody in every bank I've deaIt with.
You know how friendIy she is.
How did you and Katherine come to meet?
- The Ioan desk.
- The drop That's aII right, honey.
Sometimes I forget things too.
Or do I?
Coach, you tickIe me.
Are you aIways this funny?
I doubt it.
So, Katherine, what's new and exciting in the worId of high finance?
Nothing that I know of.
My most exciting moment is catching someone pIaying with their Iips on cIosed circuit TV.
I knew you Iooked famiIiar.
Hang on a moment.
WeII, I think banking is fascinating.
There are so many facets.
So many things I've wondered about.
- Me too, you know?
- Like what?
TeIIers never teII you anything.
They aIways ask questions.
There's nothing interesting about interest.
It's boring.
The trust department have pens chained to tabIes.
What kind of trust is that?
- There he goes again.
You're too much.
- A IittIe giddy, but nice.
Look at the time.
I've got to get up at the crack of dawn.
What a wonderfuI evening.
I'II take a rain check on coffee.
It is getting kinda Iate.
Can I see you get home OK?
Thanks.
I'd Iike that.
Good night, Diane.
Thank you.
- Good night, Sam.
- Good night.
- Good night.
We'II do it again.
- AbsoIuteIy.
This shows that sticky situations are best handIed with Iies and trickery.
And now for a IittIe romance.
A IittIe hug.
A IittIe kiss.
- A IittIe Coach.
- Excuse me.
I thought you were gonna show Katherine home.
I showed her where the bus stop is.
You probabIy didn't notice, but she had the hots for me.
What's wrong with that?
She's nice, but she doesn't fit in with us.
Like a fourth wheeI.
I need cookies.
- What do we do now?
- It's time to teII the truth.
- Good.
- I'II handIe this.
- Coach, get out here.
- Want one?
No.
Listen.
I'm gonna teII you something, and I don't care if it hurts your feeIings.
What is it?
Diane doesn't want you hanging around us any more.
What?
That's not true.
Sam doesn't want you around.
I Iove having you around.
I Iove having him around more than you.
I'd rather have him around than you.
- WeII, fine.
- Don't sneak around me Iike this.
AII right.
PIease stop.
Kids, hoId on, pIease.
I'm beginning to see the Iight here.
- You don't have the guts to teII me.
- I do, Diane doesn't.
What is it?
Say it.
Come on.
Say it.
When you were a drunk and nobody toId you, I toId you, didn't I?
- Over and over again.
- You reaIIy were a drunk.
I know.
- I mean, you were reaIIy a drunk.
- Don't start again.
Is our friendship so weak that we can't come out teII each other the truth?
You're right.
We just don't want you hanging around us so much.
If you don't want me, it's fine.
I'm not mad.
It's fine.
I'II see you.
But you reaIIy were a drunk.
- Morning, Norm.
- Where the heck have you been?
- Is my watch fast?
- Sorry.
We had a difficuIt evening.
We had to teII Coach we didn't want to see him any more.
It was terribIe.
Worse than we feared.
We spent haIf the night arguing about who was to bIame.
- Morning, everybody.
- How are you today, Norman?
As if you cared.
Coach didn't take weII to getting the oId heave-ho.
He was destroyed.
He tried to cover, but there was no masking the pain Sam infIicted on his deepest being.
Don't start again.
You did most of the taIking.
What difference does it make who did it?
The point is Coach has been crushed.
We have to Iive with that.
EspeciaIIy you.
- It was your idea.
You insisted.
- That's the most Listen.
I wanna know which one of you two kids got the idea to throw me out Iast night.
Come on.
I wanna know right now.
Come on.
What difference does it make whose fauIt it was?
It's done.
We both have to share the bIame.
Yes, the important thing is that we showed you our feeIings.
- Honesty was our onIy recourse.
- AbsoIuteIy.
It was a mutuaI decision.
Whoever it was, I wanna thank them from the bottom of my heart.
Because I caught up with Katherine at the bus stop and I took her home, got to know her and she's the most wonderfuI woman.
I haven't been this happy in years.
That's wonderfuI.
You don't know how happy we are.
And the fact that we had anything to do with it makes this feeI even better.
AbsoIuteIy.
Just think of it as the two of us being abIe to do something for you.
Say, Normie, aren't they a wonderfuI coupIe?

{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
CLIFF'S ROCKY MOMENT Someone just ordered one of your famous Kon Tiki Tikis.
No kidding.
I haven't made one of those in a Iong time.
This wiII be great.
I Iove watching you make this.
It's Iike watching Beethoven pIay a tune.
Thank you, CarIa.
There you go.
- You forgot to bIend it.
- I haven't made one since Iast summer.
I know.
Here we go.
With the recent strides in genetic engineering, we'II soon produce enormous farm animaIs to feed the hungry miIIions.
Imagine one cow to feed a city, one egg making an omeIette for a whoIe famiIy.
With the advances we're making, the future is IimitIess.
So is his mouth.
Doesn't he ever shut up?
- Who?
- Gabby, the wonder boob.
Is that humorous appeIIation supposed to refer to me?
Yeah.
You reaIise your Iips have been fIapping for over an hour?
Give it a rest, paI, and give us a break.
- Doesn't seem fair, does it?
- What?
That I have so much knowIedge and some go to bed stupid every night.
Watch your step, paI.
I guess I did carve the guy up a bit with my rapier wit.
Better go and scrape him up off the mat.
Listen, friend.
We got off on the wrong foot.
Let me buy you a beer.
- TaIk it over Iike decent human beings.
- No, thanks.
I don't Iike you.
How did it go?
The guy's taken an inexpIicabIe disIike to me.
Must be deranged.
Have you fiIIed in your footbaII pooI yet?
I gotta pick up the sIips in haIf an hour.
I'm working on it.
- I'm aImost done with mine.
- Good girI.
Yours?
Why do you even bother to fiII one out?
You don't even Iike footbaII.
I don't disIike it.
BeIieve it or not, I was on the pep squad in high schooI.
Some of my most stirring memories are of cheering for whomever it was to do whatever they were supposed to do to whomever they were supposed to do it.
Spirit Iike that can reaIIy fire a team up.
- In the first contest - Wait.
You don't know the first thing about footbaII.
- Who won the pooI Iast week?
- You've never been to a game before.
- Who won?
- You don't watch it on teIevision.
- Who won?
- You won, you won!
OK?
You won.
Anybody can win every once in a whiIe.
Everybody gets Iucky.
It's the Iaw of averages.
Just out of curiosity, when was the Iast time you won?
a Iot of times since then.
It was a decade of upsets.
AII right.
Are you interested in winning consistentIy?
Sit down.
Watch and Iearn.
Sammy's putting on his thinking cap.
It's a wee, pointy IittIe thing with ear fIaps.
But on you, it Iooks roomy.
Top of the page.
Bears against the DoIphins.
Now.
We have a home fieId advantage which means you've got to be Bears.
- Bears, just Iike that?
- Of course.
A bear against a doIphin?
I mean, that's not even a fair fight.
What about the DaIIas guys against AtIanta?
AII right.
AtIanta.
- What coIour uniforms do they wear?
- CoIour?
The coIour wiII teII you the winner.
Red beats bIue, bIue beats yeIIow, yeIIow beats mauve.
Wait.
Are you teIIing me you're going to pick AtIanta over DaIIas because of the coIour of the uniforms?
DaIIas untiI Iast week had won six games in a row.
- Who beat them Iast week?
- Washington.
What coIour was Washington wearing?
None of your business.
- The Iaws of probabiIity are compIex.
- Indeed.
Professors at HeideIberg have done studies to predict reocurrence of Oh, God.
Time for the Mickey Mouth CIub again.
Buddy, you don't know anything, so why don't you shut up before you prove it?
I'm ashamed to know you if you don't stand up to that guy.
Let it ride, wiII you?
What, are you scared?
I don't want to start a fight over a few hasty words.
Come here.
Look.
You won't have to fight him.
You just have to back him down a notch.
Trust me.
I've been in a Iot of fights and seen a Iot of fights.
BeIieve me, fighting is the Iast thing on his mind.
You just caII him out, stare at him eyebaII to eyebaII, and watch him crumbIe.
Like two fighters stare each other down before a bout.
You got it.
The name of the game is intimidation.
ReaI men have been doing it for centuries and it can work for guys Iike you, too.
- You think it'II work?
- I'm positive.
That guy is a bIowhard.
Want me to do it for you?
Look, I can do it myseIf, aII right?
- WiII you do something about this?
- About what?
CarIa is provoking CIiff into a physicaI confrontation with that Iout.
I toId you I don't want anything more vioIent in my bar than an occasionaI Iove nibbIe.
That'II never work with this guy.
Look, it's aII right.
There won't be any fisticuffs.
I'm just going to go over, stare him down, and he'II be the first to bIink.
- Wait, man.
- No.
It's something I've got to do.
The gauntIet has been thrown down.
Hey.
BeagIe breath.
You'd better not be taIking to me, paI.
If you don't Iike the way I taIk, maybe there's something you'd Iike to do about it.
I'd be gIad to.
Let's go outside.
You got it.
I'II pay and be right behind you.
Did he bIink and I missed it?
Don't worry.
He knows you're not afraid of him and he's worried.
I wouIdn't be surprised if he's run by now.
No, he's out there right now taking off his shirt.
Nice upper body deveIopment.
There comes a time when you've gotta draw the oId Iine.
- Where are you going?
- Home.
You're going through MeIviIIe's?
It's the duty of every citizen to Iearn the exits of pubIic pIaces in case of an emergency.
FIood, atomic hoIocaust - What a chicken.
- Yeah, but what a citizen.
WeII, how did my Sammykins do in the footbaII pooI?
Not so great.
But I wasn't the onIy one.
Oddsmakers took a reaI beating.
Nothing went according to form.
How many did you get?
I don't know.
Let's see.
Five, six Six out of thirteen.
That's not so bad.
- This.
This.
- Yeah, OK.
AII right.
Five.
Four.
AII right, four.
- Poor Sam.
- You kidding me?
Poor everybody.
No win day.
Upsets right across the board.
I defy anybody to predict how those games turned out.
How did you do?
WeII, I'm afraid I didn't do very weII either.
I went with cities whose symphonies are Ied by foreign-born conductors.
- You're kidding, aren't you?
- No.
Bet you did great with that system.
Not reaIIy.
I onIy got eIeven.
WeII, the heck you did.
You got tweIve.
- TweIve out of thirteen.
- You're right, I miscounted.
And the one you missed, you missed by a miIe.
There's a new ruIe.
AII bIonde waitresses out of the pooI.
You don't get to bet on footbaII any more.
You are destroying the sport of footbaII.
OK, fine.
If it's so important to you.
But this makes it impossibIe to test my theory on state fIowers.
- Hey, everybody.
- Hey, CIiff.
Meet my post office paI here, Lewis.
- The whoIe gang.
- PIeasure to meet you.
Can I have a coupIe of beers here?
So what have you got the muscIe for, huh?
What are you taIking about?
Lewis and I go way back.
Enjoy, Lewis.
- Thanks, Chris.
- It's CIiff.
My pIeasure.
You Iook Iike an athIete.
You pIay footbaII?
A IittIe bit.
MostIy, I'm a fighter.
You're You're a fighter?
You think you know a guy and he can stiII surprise you Iike that.
I didn't know you were a fighter.
That's what you asked for on the buIIetin board.
''Lewis the kidder'' - that's what they caII him.
It's Sam.
I want to put $200 on tonight's game.
Maybe you can heIp me out.
Which is the more dominant fIower, the mountain IiIy or bIack-eyed Susan?
How am I supposed to know LesIie Uggams?
Don't Don't get me wrong.
It's not Iike I think aII bIack peopIe know each other.
It's just aII good-Iooking peopIe with Iots of warmth Can I have another beer, Coach?
Round one.
Come on.
I'm a man of peace.
I'm wiIIing to Iet bygones be bygones.
If, on the other hand, my Ioud-mouthed brothers were to start troubIe, that's their business.
Scotch.
Did you hear about the studies done at Johns Hopkins about the Y chromosome of persistent bar troubIemakers?
They found a striking simiIarity between that and chronic drooIers and idiots.
OK, that's it.
Shut up, friend, and step outside.
This time you go first so you can't give me the sIip.
I'd Iike to, but I think that'd be rude to my enormous friend Lewis.
What's the probIem?
Wait.
I got no quarreI with you, paI.
This guy here's getting on my nerves.
What exactIy is it about him that bothers you?
I don't know.
The fact that he comes on as such an authority on everything.
- Hey.
It's a free country.
- I know.
I know it's a free country.
But it bugs me.
He's got an opinion on every subject.
He never shuts up.
You know, he does the same thing down at the post office.
Nobody beats him up over it.
You know, his whoIe attitude rubs me the wrong way.
I know what you mean.
Those kind of guys just do it to you.
- Who knows why?
- WeII, actuaIIy, socioIogy Shut up, CIint.
It's CIiff.
Like another beer?
No.
I don't think so.
I think I'm going home.
Let me give you a ride.
No.
I don't want my neighbours seeing me in a Studebaker.
Now, then.
I beIieve we were gonna step outside.
AII right.
AII right, Iook.
I'm a bIack beIt in karate, my hands are IethaI weapons.
Karate.
Can you beIieve this guy?
TeII you what.
I'II give you a chance to get out of here.
I'm gonna go in the back and pIay pooI.
You can say goodbye to your friends.
But Iisten.
If you're stiII here when I get back, we're going outside if I have to drag you there.
Karate, CIiff?
For crying out Ioud!
God!
What is wrong with that?
- CIifford showed exceIIent judgment.
- Give me a break.
It's the oIdest cop-out in the worId.
Every sweetheart who wants to duck out of a fight says, ''I know karate.
'' WeII, that's where you're wrong, CarIa.
I've been studying secretIy now for severaI years.
Very secretIy.
None of us heard a word about it.
Yeah, and we've heard a word out of you about everything.
It's something we don't Iike to taIk about.
We don't brag about it because it's spirituaI attainment.
What?
What's funny?
CIiff, very prudentIy, in my judgment, has refrained from taking advantage of that combative mesomorph with his superior knowIedge of karate.
- Right.
- Karate?
CIiff?
Et tu, Sammy?
I'm sorry.
Were you serious?
I hate to ask, but if you do know karate, why did you have to bring Lewis in?
There's a very good reason for that.
It's to scare off the other guy.
It's one of our major precepts.
AIways stay out of a fight if humanIy possibIe.
- AII right.
- WeII, I for one beIieve you.
- And I do too.
- And I beIieve you.
I beIieve you are a big dink.
Hey, Kung Fu.
I thought I toId you to get Iost.
What are you gonna do?
Throw my customers out?
I'm not Iooking for troubIe.
But this guy knows I don't Iike him and he's been pushing me.
If he'II admit that he's a coward and a Iiar, I'II waIk away and never bother him any more.
Come on.
What's the point?
Admit it, coward.
Or get out of here.
Happy, paI?
You proved your point.
Why don't you get out of here?
Look, I'm sorry.
That guy brings out the worst in me.
Poor CIiff.
- I wonder if he'II ever come back.
- I wouIdn't if I was him.
I don't beIieve it.
- Can I knock off?
- I'II catch up with you Iater.
- Hey, CIiff.
- If you pIan to hit him with those, you're too Iate, he Ieft.
These aren't for him.
These are for you, my so-caIIed friends.
Thanks.
I need a brick.
- Where did you get that stuff?
- Construction site next door.
Here's a demonstration of what wouId have happened to that guy if I hadn't kept a hood on my anger.
What's he doing with the shoe off?
You don't have to do this.
Listen, this is not something to fooI around with.
He is not fooIing around.
He's a bIack beIt.
- HoId it right there.
- I won't get a spIinter, wiII I?
Just keep a good grip on that.
You're reaIIy crazy.
This thing is soIid.
It's just the way I Iike them.
SoIid.
Bravo!
Get that sucker back in here!
Now that I've proved my point, goodbye to you aII forever.
Come on back in here and Iet us set you up.
AII right.
But I'd Iike to have a IittIe word with Diane.
AII right.
I've never taken a karate Iesson in my Iife.
CouId you get me to a hospitaI quick?
Goodnight, everyone.
CIiff isgoing to waIk me to my car for my protection.
Anybody got a probIem with that?
Look at this.

FORTUNE AND MEN'S WEIGHT - Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!
- How does a beer sound?
- I finish 'em before they get a word in.
Aren't you a bit dressed up to come here and suck on taps?
If you must know, I've other pIans for this evening.
I've a date.
- Who is it?
- A bIind date.
- Dangerous.
- WaIking into a minefieId.
A friend set us up.
He assures me she's perfect for me.
That's what they aII say.
She had good tabIe manners, great personaIity and an exceIIent posture?
They aIways make it sound good.
As a matter of fact, he said she was easy on the eye.
You're a dead man, Norm.
- Where do you want it?
- Want what?
I didn't order that.
- Cheers, right?
- Yeah.
Coach, did you buy this?
- Not me, Sam.
- Your name is on the invoice.
It's a mistake.
Why wouId I buy a crate?
- It's an antique scaIe.
- I bought the scaIe.
Now that I Iook at it, I'm disappointed.
We're in a hurry.
Can you sign it?
Why did you do this?
Don't buy anything for the bar without checking with me.
I'm sorry, Sam.
That saIesman, I couIdn't resist him.
He had a way about him.
- One of those fast taIkers?
- No.
Big taII skinny guy with a beard.
Reminded me of somebody in history.
The president who freed the sIaves.
- Abraham LincoIn?
- OnIy this guy wasn't nice at aII.
As a matter of fact, he was kind of mean.
He reminded me of that IittIe guy in Germany with the moustache.
- AdoIf HitIer?
- Don't pIay trivia with this guy.
A cross between Abraham LincoIn and HitIer?
Normie, I don't know.
He was strange, Normie.
He was dressed in bIack, his eyes shined Iike coaIs and he had a deep voice and he said to me, ''This scaIe wiII not onIy teII you your weight, but it wiII teII you your destiny.
'' - He had an accent?
- No.
Then why did you say it Iike your weight and your destiny?
Just a IittIe coIour, CarIa.
- I'm caIIing him to say we don't want it.
- I'd Iike to see what it Iooks Iike.
And it teIIs your fortune.
- Go on.
Open it.
- Goody.
I'm stiII sending it back.
Coach, give Norman a screwdriver, pIease.
I've got a big date.
I don't want to get pits.
Come on.
It won't be that hard.
We'II stop you before your shoes get squishy.
Here's an opening hint from a guy who's opened a Iot of these rascaIs.
If you smack this baby here, it'II open up Iike a big waInut.
That's the epicentre of the fuIcrum.
Step back, Diane.
This thing'II shear your kneecaps off.
- Are you aII right?
- I can't find my shoes, CIyde.
- I think the dog got them.
- Sit right here.
Here we go.
Let's get her out.
- Ain't that nice?
- I Iike it.
Can we keep it?
I'm afraid we're going to have to.
The number's been disconnected.
The guy's obviousIy a conman.
I knew he was a conman the minute I Iaid eyes on him.
As a coIIector of antiques, I think it might some day be worth what you paid for it.
Or a fraction thereof.
Sam, the saIesman aIso said, ''This scaIe is not being made any more.
'' ''This one was in a ceIIar for over 40 years.
'' Coach, you shouIdn't have bought it.
- This has been fun, but I gotta go.
- Normie, get on the scaIe.
See how you'II make out tonight.
Come on.
It doesn't have any fortunes Ieft after aII these years.
Do you get tired of being wrong?
''Your most troubIesome probIem wiII be soIved.
'' Sounds Iike you're going to get a trim on the oId antIers tonight.
Norm, what's your most troubIesome probIem?
That's tough to say, Coach.
Let's see.
I'm overweight, unempIoyed, separated, depressed, starting to drink too much.
I guess my biggest probIem is I've never been happier.
- I'm going next.
- Wait.
Men in uniform first, CarIa.
They Iove it.
It wiII be bigger than that amusement park in CaIifornia.
- The one with the mouse and the duck.
- DisneyIand.
You're tough, Sam, but I'm gonna get you.
- ''Sanderson, FIorist.
'' - What's the occasion, Sam?
For Diane.
Did she die?
- Of course not.
- Is she dying?
Is she suffering?
Throw me a bone.
No.
She'II be mad cos I didn't take her to some stupid art show.
FIowers are the way to caIm her down.
Hi.
Sanderson, FIorist?
There's my guy.
Give me a big smoocheroo.
- You're not mad?
- Of course not.
I just missed you so, you big Iug.
Keep up the good work.
- Hey, everybody.
- What's up, Normie?
- The corners of my mouth.
- Sounds Iike that bIind date paid off.
It turns out my buddy pIayed a trick on me.
Guess who the date turns out to be?
My ex.
Vera.
Ready for the punch Iine?
We're back together.
Norman, that's wonderfuI.
I feeI so good, I'd Iike to set up the entire bar.
But as that's financiaIIy impossibIe, I'II settIe for buying CIiff a drink.
Thank you, Norm.
Chivas on the rocks.
What, 1 2-year-oId Scotch?
I was thinking more Iike a beer.
Come on.
This is great news.
You got Vera back.
Yeah, Vera.
Not Nastassja Kinsky.
Vera.
Beer, Coach.
What's it Iike to go out on a bIind date and then you find out it's your own wife?
WeII, we were both kind of nervous at first.
Then we spIit some cIams casino and a IittIe Chateaubriand, her favourite wine.
Next thing, we went back to what used to be our pIace andwe kind of made Iove.
You can't kind of make Iove.
You don't know Vera.
- Oh, my God!
- What?
It's happening!
She's Iosing what's Ieft of her grey matter and I don't mean her underwear.
- What's wrong?
- It's his fortune.
The machine said his worst probIem wouId be soIved and Vera's back.
CarIa, that was entireIy fortuitous.
You're right, Diane.
My IittIe card said I wouId hear from a distant Ioved one.
Sure enough, a haIf hour Iater, my daughter in PennsyIvania caIIs me.
No.
That doesn't count.
She aIways caIIs you.
- PennsyIvania's not that distant.
- She caIIed me from CaIifornia.
She's on vacation there.
It had nothing to do with your fortune, or Norman's.
Yeah?
How about this?
My fortune said, ''Time waits for no one.
'' Last night, I get home Iate and my kids had started a fire cooking their dinner.
- ExpIain that.
- Easy.
You're an idiot.
Look, there are things you eggheads can't expIain away in this worId.
Listen, nothing and nobody controIs what happens to us.
You had a Iucky piece when you pitched.
A Iot of good it did me.
The onIy battIes I ever won in Iife, I won on my own.
- That was briIIiantIy put.
- You said that to me a few days ago.
But you remembered it and used it in the proper context.
Yeah, they shouId carve his face on a mountain.
You've been with Diane so Iong, you can't see the facts in front of your nose.
This machine has powers.
I guess I shouId get on and see what the future hoIds for me.
Don't joke about this.
What on earth are you doing?
I'm warding off eviI spirits.
If you weren't stupid, you'd do the same.
Preposterous.
- What does the card say?
- What difference does it make?
''Deception in romance proves costIy.
'' You see.
You know how she feeIs about honesty.
She Iikes it.
- Honest as the day is Iong.
- AbsoIuteIy.
Now, can we aII go back to work, pIease?
Good idea.
Are you aII right?
That's $20 postage due, sir, and how are we today?
- CIiff, you're in Cheers.
- Cheers.
Yes, sir.
I know where that is.
- Are you aII right?
- Yeah.
Just bruised my knee.
I hope I'II be abIe to do my postaI round tomorrow.
- Do you want to get an X-ray?
- No.
I'II just check it out here.
I'm fine.
Wait a minute, CIiff.
You got a fortune from that machine.
What was it?
What was it?
Did it say anything about faIIing down stairs?
I remember.
It was ''TaIk to bigwigs''.
- What ''ooh''?
- I don't know yet.
But there must be a connection.
- You're not in the baIIpark on this one.
- Wait.
I got it.
Bigwig, right?
- Who is the biggest bigwig of them aII?
- Sinatra.
- No.
Even bigger.
- RonaId Reagan.
- No.
Bigger.
- Sinatra.
If you ask me who runs this country, it's big oiI companies.
Who runs Texaco?
At my station, Dave and his son Herbie.
Machmoud does the windows.
You can't get much bigger than Herbie, Dave and Machmoud.
I am taIking about God.
God is the biggest wig of them aII.
CIiff, did you pray before you Ieft home this morning?
There you go.
If you had prayed, none of this wouId have happened.
Come on.
If you stretch it this far, you can make anything out of those fortunes.
- I hope this is nothing.
Mine was bad.
- What was it?
It said, ''Your vaIuabIes are in jeopardy.
'' I'II show it to you.
It's in my waIIet.
Somebody Iifted my waIIet.
CarIa, wiII you take it easy?
He'II owe you the tip.
How do you expIain that, Sammy?
- I found it.
- What do you say about that, CarIa?
It makes no difference.
The machine has been right up untiI now.
I say it's eviI.
It heard me.
I'm sorry.
Forgive me.
Stop it.
Everybody's Iooking.
Come on.
I don't want to hear any more about it.
It is not magic.
You can't take it seriousIy.
It's a sad worId we Iive in when Sam MaIone becomes the voice of reason.
What am I taIking for?
Diane taIks good.
TeII them how dumb they're being.
You're being dumb.
Had enough?
WeII, I guess I'd better get one more just to make sure it's safe to go home.
I can't Iook.
Sam, wouId you read it for me?
Don't read it if it's terribIe.
It's OK.
''You wiII grow Iips on your forehead.
'' Very funny.
- It's OK.
See you tomorrow.
- Good night, CarIa.
See you, kid.
- Keep it up.
You'II pay.
- Thank you, CarIa.
Bye-bye.
- Night, Sam.
- Good night, Coach.
- What are you doing?
- Seeing if I gained weight.
- You didn't.
Get off.
- What's wrong?
You're acting strange.
- I'm acting fine.
- Let me get my weight here.
- Sam, don't.
- WiII you teII me what's going on?
You're coming ungIued here.
I feeI Iike I'm Iosing my mind.
- That scaIe has me spooked.
- You're kidding me?
You're the Iast person I expect to faII for that voodoo stuff.
- Do you remember that fortune I got?
- No.
- ''Deception in romance proves costIy.
'' - So?
I took another man to that show Iast night.
You mean, Iike a guy?
At Ieast pay attention.
He's a cIassmate of mine.
A maIe cIassmate.
So you took some pimpIy wimp from schooI.
Big deaI.
His compIexion is as cIear as mine and we had a wonderfuI time.
At the performance?
Of course he took me home.
And?
I invited him in.
We had coffee.
He Ieft.
That was it.
Instant coffee or did you grind the beans?
It wasn't the same as it is with you.
I didn't grind them fine.
You did grind the beans?
AII we did was taIk.
- You didn't kiss him?
- I kissed him good night.
It was nothing.
It was bareIy on the Iips.
On the side.
Very dry.
I have to be honest.
It was so good to taIk to someone.
I miss taIking about the things I can't taIk about with you.
I didn't teII you because you'd be angry.
- I'm not angry.
- Of course you are.
No, I'm not.
As a matter of fact, I'm kind of gratefuI.
I think I see our reIationship in a new Iight.
The truth is I don't fuIfiI aII your needs and you don't fuIfiI aII mine.
So maybe we shouId caII it quits.
What are you doing?
I have one innocent evening with a guy.
I come to you to make a cIean breast of it and this is the reaction I get.
You're even Iess understanding than I feared.
Fine.
I want out of this.
Out of what?
I aIready broke it off.
You said, ''Maybe we shouId caII it quits.
'' I'm saying it's definiteIy over.
Hey, I don't care what I said.
In my mind, it was definite.
That ship has saiIed.
Our reIationship is through.
No, we're not through, unIess I say we're through.
We're through.
Now we're through.
I'm not having an argument about who broke up with who first.
With somebody I broke up with.
I'm not going to acknowIedge your presence.
Is anybody here?
Somebody I used to go with?
No.
It's just Diane.
SiIIy me.
- Don't do this.
- It's aIready done.
Sam, pIease.
PIease don't joke about this.
I'm scared.
We can't break up because a piIe of metaI springs said we were going to.
There's too much at stake.
I'm sorry.
Forgive me.
- TeII me you didn't break up with me.
- Of course I didn't.
Then I'm first.
- You are history.
- That was a rotten Now I know why I broke up with you Iong before you broke up with me.
Who's taIking?
It's just my empIoyer.
Sam, we got a fortune.
- So?
- Aren't you going to read it?
No.
What's the point?
Our destiny may be in that card.
I know it.
I can feeI it.
- You're crackers.
You know that?
- Then read it.
OK.
Fine.
You sure we shouId do this?
We've got to.
There might be no other way.
AII right.
''Machine empty.

{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
SNOW JOB - Here's your maiI.
- Thanks.
I'm afraid they're aII biIIs.
I'II give them to BiII the moment he comes in.
- That's pretty funny.
- Thank you.
HoId on there, sport.
As you can see, I'm wearing the coIours myseIf here.
As a veteran postaI carrier, I'm shocked.
Department poIicy regarding uniform states and I quote, ''Uniform shouId be buttoned up to the second button from the coIIar.
'' - You're Ietting us down, son.
- I'm sorry.
I didn't mean any harm.
It's aII right.
I was green once, too.
You'II make it.
- Thank you.
I'II try to do better.
- Carry on.
- Here's your beer, CIiff.
- CIiff?
Say, you're not, by any chance, CIiff CIavin?
Sure am.
You heard of me?
Your name is a symboI around our branch office.
Is that right?
WeII, just the other day I messed up and my supervisor toId me to get my head out of my CIavin.
- Damn.
- What's wrong?
Ann Marie's teacher's gonna have to hoId her back.
That's too bad, CarIa.
Don't worry.
It's just as bad to skip a grade.
- You skipped a grade?
- I skipped four.
High schooI, I think they caIIed it.
I hope being heId back isn't going to be traumatic for Ann Marie.
She's been heId back twice.
In her cIass picture, she Iooks Iike Snow White.
Coach, set me up with another beer.
Where's Normie?
I've got a great story.
Ain't my job to keep tabs on the waIking beer keg.
- Who cares about your stupid story?
- Thank you, CarIa.
If you serve that beer any sIower, it's going to be vinegar.
I'm on the verge of a new record for fewest gIasses broken.
How cIose are you?
I have to make it to midnight without breaking seven gIasses.
There must be four inches of feathers down there.
Six inches.
You can't be too carefuI.
I never thought I'd see you work with a net.
You never wiII.
Hi, honey.
So the cameI says, ''You get your own date.
'' - Evening, everybody.
- Norm!
- What's shaking?
- Four cheeks and a coupIe of chins.
- So what'II it be?
- A pitcher.
How about you, George?
Who's your funny friend here?
- Sorry.
CIiff CIavin, George FoIey.
- PIeasure.
- We met at unempIoyment.
- What Iine of work are you out of?
Tree surgeon.
I quit cos I fainted at the sight of sap.
I'm getting a IittIe woozy right now.
Very humorous.
Norm, I heard a great joke down by the sorting machine.
George cIaims he can run the tabIe before I chaIk my cue stick.
- Put your money where your mouth is.
- I tried it but the biIIs got sodden.
I Iike him.
He's funny.
The rest of us are Iaughing out of pity at the man's ugIiness.
He Iooks Iike a gnarIed creature you find Come to think of it, he didn't say where he was from.
You know what I hate about working here?
I know what I hate, but it couIdn't be the same thing.
Coach, two vodka rocks.
We never get hoIidays off.
It's George Washington's birthday.
We'II be stuck here.
Sam won't.
This is when he goes on a ski trip.
What ski trip?
He and his basebaII cronies go to Vermont every year.
They rent a chaIet, ski and meIt a few snow bunnies.
- They've been doing it for years.
- He won't do it this year.
- Why not?
- Because he's invoIved with me now.
I know, but I stiII beIieve in the oId Sam MaIone.
I say he's stiII got some hair on his butt.
Perhaps, CarIa, your desperate observations refIect the reIationships between men and women in the demimonde you inhabit, but for those of us who no Ionger scrape our knuckIes on the ground, your views are incredibIy primitive.
Says you!
Sam, what's the matter?
I got a caII from my Aunt AIice this afternoon.
UncIe Nathan died yesterday.
I'm so sorry.
- Was he sick Iong?
- No, Coach.
He was hit by a bus.
That's comforting.
I'm sorry.
I'm going to have to Ieave right now.
I gotta go to Vermont for the funeraI.
- Did you say Vermont?
- My condoIences in your time of sorrow.
- Thank you, CarIa.
- I was taIking to Diane.
- Where in Vermont?
- Stowe.
Stowe.
Isn't that a ski resort?
I think there is one nearby there.
I gotta Ieave now.
I'm going to be gone a coupIe of days.
This whoIe thing, I don't know.
Sam, you must have been very cIose with your uncIe.
- Very cIose.
- I shouId be with you at a time Iike this.
No.
I think it wouId just be too depressing for you.
I'II stay at my aunt's house and she doesn't beIieve in unmarried coupIes sIeeping together.
We don't have to sIeep together.
Why wouId you be coming, then?
To support you emotionaIIy through this tragedy.
You are so sweet, but I just don't think it's a good idea.
Sam says his UncIe Nathan in Vermont just died.
- He sure did.
- Do you beIieve that?
They wouIdn't make funeraI arrangements if he wasn't dead.
I think they've got a test for that.
Coach, why don't you teII Diane the truth?
There is no UncIe Nathan.
Sam's accepted it, so we aII have to.
That guy is good.
He made me Iook Iike a big dope out there.
What did he do, turn the Iights on?
What's that supposed to mean?
Nothing.
Let me teII you that story.
We gotta get going.
We're going to the IsIanders game.
George has season tickets.
Smack in the middIe.
I hope you have a good time.
Nice to meet you.
Hope you catch a puck in your CIavin.
OK, I'II caII you in a coupIe of days.
PIease convey my sympathy to your aunt.
I wiII.
Thank you.
That's very sweet.
Bye-bye.
How Iong were your aunt and UncIe Nathan married?
How Iong?
40, 50 years.
I don't know.
My, my, my.
It must be very hard on her.
Just imagine.
OK.
I'm off now.
Do you know the secret of a Iong-Iasting reIationship?
No, I don't, Diane, but I wiII think about it as I drive aIong.
It's honesty, Sam.
Once honesty Ieaves a reIationship, the reIationship is over.
If one of us were to Iie to the other now, it wouId be a crime of the souI.
Our Iives wouId be diminished beyond redemption.
This is not one of the worId's great goodbyes here.
Of course.
You'd better go.
Be carefuI.
There'II be a Iot of skiers on the road and you know how insensitive peopIe on their way to a ski weekend can be.
You're hanging by your fingernaiIs, honey.
He'II be back tonight.
You don't beIieve her either, Coach?
No.
I've got feathers in my shoes.
I don't know how a chicken keeps a straight face.
- Coach, I need a draught.
- One draught coming up.
CarefuI.
For the record, Coach.
The record's in the bag.
I've got Iess than four hours and five gIasses to go.
- Don't get cocky.
- I can't Iose.
I've never broken five gIasses in four hours in my Iife.
Watch this.
- Coach, you swept out the feathers.
- Feathers are for chickens.
Here.
- You made your point.
- Made my point?
Watch this.
You're onIy two away now.
Two away.
Do you know what I think of two away?
- What?
- It scares the heII out of me.
Do you want to give me another drink?
So what's your probIem, droopy drawers?
You've been moping around Iike a schooI girI who broke up with her steady.
Moping?
I'm not moping.
Just spending a IittIe quiet time by myseIf.
That's what a man is.
SoIitary, strong, independent.
Ever hear of the Ione woIf, CarIa?
The Ione woIf, c'est moi.
A man needing no one.
I touch no one and no one touches me.
I'm a rock.
I'm an isIand.
- Evening, everybody.
- Norm!
- Beer, Normie?
- I don't know.
I had one this week.
What the heck.
I'm young.
- So who won the hockey game?
- Bruins.
8-7 in overtime.
A reaI yawner.
- So where's Rootie Kazootie?
- George?
He turned out to be a jerk.
He saw some friends at the game.
He sits with them and Ieaves me there.
It happens.
Friend turns against friend.
I guess so.
Want to shoot some pooI?
What?
You want to shoot pooI with me?
Norm has deigned to ask me to shoot pooI with him.
Do I have time to get down on my knees and thank God you've seIected me?
OK, but hurry.
We shouIdn't Iose that tabIe there.
I hope I can be as deIightfuI a companion as you're used to.
This is Iike sarcasm, right?
You're a reaI tack, Norm.
CIiffie, I understand how you feeI.
You're not second best, paI.
You're aces.
I'd be honoured if you wouId shoot some pooI with me.
ReaIIy.
WeII, aII right, but - Norm, where were you?
- Georgie, my man!
- I Iooked aII over for you.
- Go, Bruins!
Let's get a burger.
I know where to get the best in town.
On second thoughts, I don't think I'II go.
- Sure?
- I'm not hungry.
Whatever you say.
I'II go aIone.
- The best burgers in town you say?
- AbsoIuteIy.
- I'd Iove a good burger.
- GIad to hear it.
- You were going to go with him.
- With that jerk?
I was trying to get his hopes up there.
What do you say we go and shoot some stick?
AII right.
But stick the pooI cues up your nostriIs and make Iike a waIrus.
Right.
I got another twist on it.
I can get the fat ends in there now.
Watch this.
The fat ends, you say.
We're out of oIives.
Did Sam order any?
Why don't you just ask him?
Why, where's Sam?
I thought that you said Sam was coming tonight, Diane.
He's probabIy just coming around the corner, down the stairs now.
I shouId hurry and greet him.
Open the door for my boss on his return.
- HeIIo there, Sam.
- Hi, CarIa.
- Ski weekend, right?
- What?
Come on.
It was three miIes away from my aunt's house and it came to me.
- Ski weekend, am I right?
- I'm confused.
What ski weekend?
Somebody probabIy toId you I used to go skiing with my buddies on this weekend.
Now that you mention it, CarIa said something.
- I knew it.
- Coach, two draughts.
Because of that, you decide I'm Iying about my UncIe Nathan.
For a moment, I was a trifIe suspicious.
That is totaIIy siIIy, honey.
That ski weekend is part of my past.
What kind of guy with a sweII chick Iike yourseIf wouId fooI around?
Even when I was on that weekend, I didn't fooI around much.
Even if I were, I wouIdn't be doing what you think and I'm not, so it's Iess.
So you feeI OK now?
- I was never not OK.
- You weren't?
Great.
What a siIIy misunderstanding this was.
There was never a misunderstanding.
I knew the truth the whoIe time.
That's great.
WeII, I'm off again.
If you were going to Iie, you wouId have come up with something smarter than this funeraI thing.
- What do you mean by that?
- I couId check in a minute.
I couId caII a IocaI newspaper and ask them to check on their death notices.
Of course.
Everybody knows that.
I got a funeraI waiting for me.
Don't we aII?
WeII, sIats, you bIew it again.
This time he's gone.
He'II be back within the hour.
Damn tropicaI drinks.
- It's too bad about the record.
- We were puIIing for you.
I came so cIose.
Don't worry about it.
I stiII got a personaI record I'm proud of.
- What's that?
- 1 1 days without starting a fire.
It's aImost cIosing time.
You said that Sam wouId be back before cIosing time.
Damn!
Let's you and me stop pIaying games.
- AIms for the dink.
- Poor deviI.
WouId you Ieave me aIone, pIease?
I was aImost up there this time before it hit me.
You don't beIieve me.
I know it.
I think that is reaIIy rotten.
I've never seen you act this crazy.
It's so Iate.
You'II miss your uncIe's funeraI.
How do you expect me to enjoy a funeraI when you're making me nuts?
What are you taIking about?
Every time I go, you say some IittIe thing.
I've been there so often, they changed the sign to ''WeIcome To Vermont, Sam''.
What are you accusing me of?
I'm accusing you of accusing me of being a Iiar.
CaIIing the newspaper.
You said that to get me crazy.
You and I both know you wouIdn't make that caII.
WouId you?
You did it!
You caIIed them!
I can't beIieve it!
Now you know there's no funeraI, no Nathan MaIone.
What a stupid name.
- I didn't caII.
- You didn't?
I Iook Iike an idiot.
No argument there.
- AII right.
I'd better teII you the truth.
- That'd be nice.
Diane, I work for the government.
- What are you taIking about?
- I am on a top secret mission.
- You are an idiot.
- That's just my cover.
Come on.
You've been pIaying games with me.
- Don't you think you deserve it?
- Deserve it?
You're taIking to me Iike taIking to a chiId.
- You've been acting Iike one.
- Don't use that tone of voice.
- What tone is that?
- That one right there!
I hate it!
OK.
Fine.
Here's a different tone.
- You sIime!
- What?
- How dare you Iie to me Iike that?
- I had to Iie to you.
You made me.
What wouId you have said if I said to you, ''I want to go on a semi-harmIess ski weekend with my buddies.
'' That's it.
I've had enough.
I don't care what you do.
I don't want to Iook at your big, fIabby face any more.
FooI around with every women in Vermont.
I don't care.
Is that a fact?
That's exactIy what I'm going to do.
I'm going to go and have every girI in Vermont.
Even the bowsers.
Go.
By aII means, go.
Have aII New EngIand for aII I care.
- Maybe I'II just do that.
- MuII this over on your ride to paradise.
There happens to be a certain box boy at my market.
A sinewy youth who aIways wants to carry my bags, if you know what I mean.
Perhaps I'II go over there tomorrow and not demur at his subtIe, yet oh-so-unequivocaI advances.
You do that, Diane, and I'II try reaI hard to give a damn.
HoIy mackereI.
I forgot to ask him about the oIives.
- He'II be back in ten minutes.
- I say five, CarIa.
Maybe even sooner.
A box boy?

COACH BURIES A GRUDGE - Hey, everybody.
- How are you doing?
- Surprise, surprise.
- Looky there.
What's the occasion?
Just a IittIe peace offering.
I'm trying to make up for Iast night.
You shouId feeI bad about that.
No guy Iikes to be Iaughed at at that particuIar moment.
I couIdn't heIp it.
You had that Iook on your face and for just a second, you Iooked Iike a fIounder.
- Maybe it was the Iight.
- ApoIogy accepted.
But this better be a damn good gift, I'II teII you that.
I'II be darned.
It's a sweater?
An IceIandic snowfIake rag wooI sweater.
I saw it in a cataIogue.
I had to get it.
- Thank you.
I Iove it.
It's great.
- Put it on right now.
I Iike to Iive with a piece of cIothing for a IittIe whiIe before I wear it.
Come on.
I know it's unusuaI.
It Iooks different when it's on.
One person Iaughs He wiII be exhibiting his own insecurity and Iack of taste.
I just hate Iooking siIIy.
Sam is about to modeI his new sweater for us.
- Look, CIiffie, goose bumps.
- Nothing in my horoscope about that.
- Does it fit aII right?
- It fits OK.
Come in and take a Iook.
You come out and show everyone what a fashion pIate you are.
BeIieve me, not so much as a smirk.
I never saw a fIounder in a sweater before.
Sam, the TV's on the bIink again.
- Where's CarIa?
- CarIa, get out here!
TV's on the fritz.
Work or die.
- I have a way with inanimate objects.
- Take a crack at Norm.
- What do you mean?
- What do I mean?
Sitting Iike a Iump.
You Iost your zest for Iife, pIaying motorboat in your beer.
I'm OK.
It's just not the same since Vera's been out of town.
I miss having her around.
- Where is she?
- She went to visit her parents.
She's out there for a week in Where the heck do they Iive?
One of those rectanguIar states.
Why didn't you go with her?
Her parents aren't happy I'm out of work.
They think I don't try.
They got this crackpot idea that if I Iook every day, make phone caIIs aII the time, somehow, by magic, a job's going to appear.
- Voodoo?
- ReaIIy.
Sam, Iet me have two vodka rocks.
Where are those BIoody Marys?
I'm way behind.
Coach is supposed to be back from Phoenix.
He's there for T-Bone Scappagione's funeraI.
His best friend.
They were team-mates in the minors and coached for the Sox.
- How come you didn't go, Sam?
- It's funny.
I never cared for the guy.
Let's face it.
Taste in peopIe isn't your strong point.
Ah, yes.
How wouId we manage without CarIa's wit?
CarIa, how do you manage without it?
- What don't you Iike about this T-Bone?
- Lots of things.
He's the kind of guy who can't pass a mirror without checking himseIf out.
Thinks he's God's gift to women.
You know the kind.
AII right.
There's a difference between thinking it and knowing it.
- Hi, everybody.
- Where have you been?
I'm sorry I'm Iate, but T-Bone wanted to be buried in the famiIy pIot and I brought the body back.
Did he die of a mysterious aiIment that turns you to cardboard?
The body's at the mortuary.
This is a promotionaI thing we did when we were at the Birmingham Barons.
OId T-Bone, he saved it aII these years, so I brought it back for Cheers.
- Some Iuck, Sam?
- Words faiI me, Coach.
It wiII be Iike having my oId buddy back with me here.
ActuaIIy, I think this wiII be better.
Sam, that's a wonderfuI thought.
I'II put this in my office for safekeeping.
I'd hate to see it get stoIen.
How was the funeraI, Coach?
ActuaIIy, Diane, it was kind of gIoomy.
WeII, you know, after aII, it's hardIy an occasion for rejoicing.
Everything was perfectIy nice.
It was reaIIy a nice ceremony, but they didn't say much about the reaI T-Bone.
He's been Iiving in Phoenix for a coupIe of years and those peopIe didn't know him.
They shouId have had the funeraI here, where his paIs are.
Right.
They didn't even know why they caIIed him T-Bone.
Why did they caII him T-Bone?
I don't know.
I was hoping to find out.
- I just had a wonderfuI idea.
- CouId we get you not to teII us?
Not a prayer.
Why couIdn't we have a memoriaI right here?
We couId invite T-Bone's buddies and they couId toast his memory.
That's a terrific idea.
Everybody couId taIk about the reaI T-Bone.
I'II make a Iist of guys to caII.
Guys mourning isn't good for business.
They mourn, they drink.
CaII me a sentimentaI oId fooI, but I'm for it.
What you've written here is beautifuI, but you know what it couId use?
A IittIe bit more about T-Bone himseIf.
OK.
TeII me about him.
In his pIaying days, he was a good hitter.
His prowess at the pIate was Iegendary.
He was a fair hitter, Diane.
Fair.
For the minors.
He was a capabIe batsman.
AII those hits he got were a Iot of scratch and fieId hits.
His best moments were off the fieId.
That's the idea.
He aIways made the guys Iaugh.
He was Ioved for his sense of humour.
He was aIways making fun of peopIe.
We admired his sardonic wit.
I've seen him ride guys tiII they were reduced to tears.
He was a hatefuI and terribIe person.
Why don't you stick with what I had?
You're right.
I'd better go practise.
HeIIo.
I've heard a Iot about you.
WeII, hoId on a sec and I'II check.
Are you in for Vera?
Sure.
She's out of town.
What can it hurt?
Tracked me down?
I miss you.
It hasn't been the same without you around the house.
How's your mum?
You're at our house?
Since when?
You never Ieft?
I thought I heard someone in the john this morning.
I can't beIieve this man was vain.
Does this picture do him justice?
OnIy a firing squad wouId do him justice.
What is your probIem with this man?
- I know something nobody eIse does.
- Like what?
Just trust me.
It's very sIeazy.
- This sounds serious.
TeII me what it is.
- I can't.
I'm sorry.
WouId you Iike another sweater?
Once, when Coach was out of town, this was a Iong time ago, T-Bone made a pIay for his wife AngeIa.
- The rakeheII.
- He didn't get anywhere with her.
She toId me after keeping it a secret for so Iong.
She was afraid to teII Coach.
It wouId have made him crazy.
- The scum.
- I know.
Making a pIay for his best friend's wife.
Even you wouIdn't do that.
Thank you for that, Diane.
I can't take credit for that because most of my friends' wives are reaI uggos.
Let's pray this secret goes to the grave with T-Bone.
I hope so, cos if Coach ever finds out, it wouId put him right in the toiIet.
Where do you want to put this for the ceremony?
In that case, where wouId you Iike Diane to stand?
- Coach, I know - I hate him, Sam.
You have to put this behind you.
AngeIa and T-Bone are in heaven now.
Let's hope he's not hitting on her up there.
I just wish AngeIa had toId me about it.
A man and a woman shouIdn't keep secrets from each other.
- I don't think I agree with you, Coach.
- You don't?
I don't think so.
Let's take an outIandish exampIe, Iike us, for instance.
In the unIikeIy event that you'd ever succumb to a momentary temptation, I wouId prefer, hypotheticaIIy, to remain obIivious.
You got it.
- What do you mean by that?
- I was going aIong with what you said.
- You went aIong pretty fast.
- When you're right, you're right.
You said it Iike you had something in mind.
- I don't.
- You'd better not.
- I don't.
I swear.
- TeII the truth.
- That is the truth.
- Good.
Then I wouIdn't want to know.
Now I see what you've been up to aII this time, you You're trying to drive her crazy, so she'II kiII herseIf.
- I Iove it.
If I can be of any heIp at aII.
- I'II keep you in mind.
- Hey, Ernie.
- Hey, Artie.
It's good to see you after aII these years.
- You Iook great.
- I feeI fine.
It couId be happier circumstances.
When did you hear the shocking news?
I was in the john and I overheard Sam and Diane.
- You mean you knew about it?
- It's in aII the papers.
Oh, my God.
The afternoon edition even had pictures.
- I'm a Iaughing stock.
- You misunderstood.
It's great you're having a ceremony for T-Bone.
There ain't going to be a ceremony for T-Bone, Artie.
That fiIthy pig.
- Why, Coach?
- You read it in the papers!
- Coach, he's taIking about him dying.
- There's nothing to say.
Come into my office to taIk.
Arthur, have a drink on the house.
CarIa, heIp him get a drink there, pIease.
- What the heII are you doing?
- I'm going to heIp you with Coach.
I've known him for 20 years.
I think by now I've an idea how to heIp him.
Fine.
I'II be waiting right here, when you faiI.
When and if you faiI.
More when.
Come on.
You have go through with this.
The guys wiII be there.
He betrayed me.
I Ioved him Iike a brother.
Once they threatened to send him down to a doubIe-A cIub and I swear to you, I went and said, ''You send T-Bone down, you gotta send me down, too.
'' - I did.
- As I recaII, you Iiked it down there.
We had a great time.
Why did he do it to me?
Coach, I don't know.
Listen to me.
It was a one-time thing, Coach.
He Iost his head once.
You're going to have to accept it and forgive him.
But why did he do it?
I can't answer that.
I just hate watching it eat you up Iike this.
I wish I couId cheer you up.
Wait.
You haven't seen this.
This is great.
Look at this.
Don't I Iook Iike a dink?
OrdinariIy, Sam, that wouId have me on the fIoor, but not today.
PuII yourseIf out of this.
It's in the past.
For him, it's the past.
For me, it's just happening.
I can heIp you, Coach.
Let your subconscious speak to me.
Work through your feeIings about T-Bone.
They need to be reIeased.
If he was here, I'd reIease aII his teeth.
That's good.
TeII T-Bone how angry you are to work through your feeIings.
Come on, Diane, T-Bone's dead.
No, he isn't.
Here's T-Bone right here.
- SpiII your guts to him.
- This isn't a good idea.
- It'II heIp him.
- I hate Iooking siIIy.
Hey, Ernie, how are you doing?
It has to be deeper, Sam, Iike ''Hey, Ernie, how are you doing?
'' Right.
He'd taIk and he'd wipe his nose.
Hey, Ernie, how are you doing?
It's ''Hey, Ernie, how are you doing?
'' and then he'd wipe it that way.
After.
- Hey, Ernie, how are you doing?
- The sniff has to be Iouder.
- The sniff is fine.
- WiII you two pIease stop?
That is irreIevant.
Something is eating away at Coach's guts.
Address that.
Ernie, your wife was a wonderfuI woman.
She was reaIIy beautifuI.
I Iost my head.
Can you bIame me for going crazy about something I couId never have myseIf?
She was the best.
Nobody couId resist her.
Come on.
Go out and make that speech for me.
Come on.
The peopIe out there think that I'm a reaI nice guy and a good friend.
Leave me that.
T-Bone, what you did, I can never forgive you for.
Never.
You're dead and there's onIy one way I can get even with you.
It's to go out and do you in and I'm going to do it.
- Coach, come on.
- Stay away from me!
Everybody, thanks for coming, but Iet's get this over with.
- The memoriaI service is about to begin.
- Last caII before the memoriaI!
Don't do this.
It won't make you feeI any better.
I'm feeIing better just thinking about it.
OK, everybody's sat?
AII right, I had a beautifuI speech written here, but I'd rather say a few things from my own heart about T-Bone Scappagione.
- Coach, don't - Just Iet me get it over with, Sam.
T-Bone Scappagione was a son of a That man was a son of a T-Bone Scappagione was the son of an immigrant.
Like most immigrants, he was a human being.
Human beings make mistakes.
We're just not perfect.
But I'II teII you what isn't a mistake.
To Iove someone and to forgive them, no matter what his shortcomings.
That's not a mistake.
I Ioved that manand I forgive him.
And I know that, for the rest of my Iife, every day, there's going to be a moment when I'm going to miss him.
That's aII I've got to say.
That was beautifuI, Ernie.
- Thanks, Artie.
- No, I mean it.
That stuff couId aImost make me forgive him for what he did to me.
For what he did to you?
What did he do?
- He went after my wife.
- Yours, too?
- You guys got off easy.
- What did he do to you?
He borrowed $500 from me.
He never tried to pay me back.
- That's worse than chasing our wives?
- I've seen your wives.
Why beat around the bush?
Let's admit the guy was a fungo.
I got to admit I stiII Iove him.
He never made a pass at my wife.
Are you nuts?
He was at your house so often, he got maiI there.
My wife wouId never cheat on me.
He was the worst guy I ever knew.
We shouIdn't be honouring him.
We shouId be dancing on his grave.
Come on.
What are you doing?
Listen, you gotta forget about how he was in Iife and remember him as he is now.
Dead.
I say we take that cardboard cutout and do to it what we shouId have done to him whiIe he was aIive!
Let's hang him in effigy!
The heII with that, Iet's hang him here in Boston!

NORMAN'S CONQUEST You got the next round ready for the Iadies in the back room?
- AImost.
- Aren't they a cute group?
The GoIden 80s CIub.
A bunch of oId widows and spinsters get together and pIay connect the Iiver spots.
I agree with Diane, CarIa.
They're absoIuteIy adorabIe.
- You Iike anybody who caIIs you sonny.
- Yeah.
AII set, Diane.
This is quite a Ioad.
I'II take two trips.
Yes.
There is a non-professionaI for you.
Last round, I got them aII in one trip.
- One more beer.
- Like me to carry it for you?
No.
No probIem.
I'II simpIy do as the nobIe women of primitive tribaI cuItures do - I'II baIance it on my noodIe.
Those sweet IittIe oId Iadies are gonna Iove this!
- Look!
It's Lawrence WeIk!
- No!
Stop!
- And you're wrong.
- In your hat.
I've Iost track, CarIa.
What round is this?
I can't count that high.
So we can foIIow the fun, what's this fight about?
We're not fighting.
We're discussing a difference of opinion.
Vodka rocks, two.
I think Sam is a heartIess, mindIess, sIack-jawed cretin and he disagrees.
He'II see reason eventuaIIy.
Let me know when his head Iights up.
You take a connecting fIight to get to the point.
We were taIking about the way you don't trust me, motormouth.
No, broken brow, we settIed that.
You were proven wrong and we moved on.
Credit me with enough inteIIigence to humiIiate you in the right subject area.
My favourite coupIe.
Steve and Eydie Amin.
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!
- Normie, couId this be Vera?
- With expensive surgery, maybe.
This is EmiIy PhiIIips and she runs a boutique downtown.
I've just taken them on as a cIient.
Why are they so excited?
You said you had Iots of cIients.
They're naturaIIy happy peopIe.
They sing the Iive-Iong day.
Hi.
WeIcome to Cheers.
I'm Sam MaIone.
- What kind of boutique is it?
- A dress shop, struggIing to survive.
Thanks to Norm, I'II get a heaIthy tax return.
I did a few simpIe things.
She wasn't writing off her cockroaches as Iivestock.
I'm so proud of us.
Women have taken our pIace in society as never before.
Working, doing, rising on merit through the ranks.
We are taking our pIace aIongside of and in many cases above men.
- Once expIoited, now we are equaI.
- Shake it up!
I'm dry over here!
Excuse me.
Pardon me.
I gotta caII the shop.
I reaIIy Iike this Cheers pIace.
- Do you come here often?
- What's often?
- Two or three times a week.
- Then I don't come here often.
- Can I have a beer?
- You toId her you have a Iot of cIients?
someone working out of his car.
What's going on?
You seem kind of friendIy.
She brought me in to ceIebrate the outstanding work I did.
I don't know.
I sense something between the two of you.
The temperature rose when you two waIked in.
You're her new accountant.
Have you gone over her figure?
Does she have sizeabIe assets?
Is she showing you capitaI gains to make you Iiquidate your hoIdings?
It's aII very weII to be witty, but you don't understand.
She's just a nice Iady and she wanted to show me her appreciation.
That's what you think.
Haven't you noticed the Iooks she's shooting at you?
Like you're a juicy steak, soon to be sizzIing on a griII.
Here she comes.
- Where do you want to sit?
- That tabIe's fine.
- What can I get you?
- Whatever you have wiII be fine.
Come on.
Don't be ridicuIous.
Let's submit this to our resident expert on womenoIogy.
WeII, I don't usuaIIy think of myseIf that way, but I'd be happy to share my thoughts.
What do you think, Sam?
- I think she's scouting your territory.
- Norman, ignore these bIatherskites.
- They're having fun at your expense.
- She's right.
The emptiness of their Iives causes them to cast aspersions on yours.
- You can say that again.
- No, I can't.
I know these guys are joking.
They know that if anything did happen it wouId injure the speciaI one you Iove.
I'd get over it in a coupIe of weeks.
Look at the way she's Iooking at you.
She is hot for your bod.
- There you go.
- There you are.
I've been getting IoneIy.
WouId you excuse me just one moment, pIease?
You're right.
The woman's a she deviI.
- What shaII I do?
- The course is cIear.
You act Iike the man you are and submit to her every demand.
Thank you.
Can I have an opinion from someone who's had a date this century?
You toId her you were married, right?
Course.
She knows about Vera.
I mentioned her a few times.
My wedding ring's there for everyone to see, at a pawn shop on BoyIson Street.
You see?
You're aIways making these crass, adoIescent jokes about Vera.
This woman takes you seriousIy.
She thinks you don't care about your wife.
- Don't Iisten to her.
Go for it.
- Be a man, Norm.
You are recommending Norman commit aduItery.
It happens aII the time, stick.
That's the way Iife is.
The difference between ''Dynasty'' and the reaI worId is they got better hair cuts.
What do you think, Sam?
I think it's stupid to jump into bed with somebody you're working with.
I didn't mean stupid in the uninteIIigent sense.
Sam's depressed.
This is the year his age caught up with his IQ.
That's years away.
- Norm, do you find her attractive?
- Of course.
She's very attractive.
If it was me she was attracted to, I wouIdn't be hanging around a bar taIking to jerks.
Yeah, Norm.
Do something.
Come on.
- Is anything wrong, Norm?
- He's gonna take care of you.
- Just a sec, EmiIy.
- Norm.
Look.
If you're scared, I'II take charge.
With me it won't be sinfuI.
Just unsightIy.
If you're interested, strike whiIe the iron is hot.
Norman, wiII you do me a favour?
- What?
- CaII Vera.
- Why?
- Just caII her and Iisten to her voice before you rend asunder the invioIate garment of your marriage.
Diane, pIease.
- Are you afraid?
- Afraid to taIk to my own wife?
EmiIy, I'II be with you in a minute.
Quick business caII here.
HeIIo, Vera, it's Norm.
I'm at Cheers.
It's 8:05.
You need me, you've got the number here.
Bye.
- You have an answering machine?
- No, that was Vera.
I think you'd better give the Iady what she wants.
If you don't come across, she's going to drop you Iike a bad habit.
Norman, has it come to this?
Are you going to seII your virtue to the first person who buys you a drink?
If you were a woman, we'd have a name for you.
I kind of Iike Becky.
I reaIise Norma is cIoser.
You just have to add U-H, but CouId everybody back off?
Is my private Iife a subject of pubIic debate?
- You backing out?
- Guys, Iay off.
OK, Sam.
Norm, we were just kidding with you.
- We knew you wouIdn't do it.
- We know what kind of guy he is.
We know he wouIdn't cheat on Vera.
AII right.
Norm, Iook.
We'II even sing your wedding song for you.
Yes, dear.
Of course.
Right away.
You think I'm the heavyweight champion wuss.
UnchaIIenged.
Stand back and eat my dust.
Stormin' Norman is primed for Iove.
You better hurry up.
She's on her way out.
Hey, EmiIy.
Wait up.
Are you trying to ditch me?
It's obvious you'd rather be with your friends.
I'm in the way.
That was rude.
I'm sorry.
I'd Iike to make it up to you.
- It's OK.
- PIease.
Let me buy you dinner.
That might be nice.
But I don't feeI Iike being around peopIe any more.
Me neither.
I guess I couId fix a IittIe something over at my pIace.
Sounds good.
You don't have to go through with this.
Have there been any innovations in women's undergarments since 1 965?
I'm so disappointed in Norman.
Your probIem is a Iack of understanding of the maIe of the species.
Man was not made to be monogamous.
It's an artificiaI phenomenon imposed from without.
The maIe can never have enough women.
Or in your case, any.
Don't be too hard on Norm.
He's inexperienced.
He got swept away.
It makes me aImost gratefuI the amount of experience you've had with women.
I think by now your curiosity is satisfied, your inexpIicabIe Iusts sated.
If our reIationship remains as strong as it is now you'II have no need for sexuaI experience with another woman.
Oh, my God.
What do you mean, ''Oh, my God?
'' I just never thought about that before.
My Iast woman.
- You do agree, don't you?
- I don't know.
- Why not?
- Come on.
Something couId happen to you.
You couId die or go insane or What happens if you don't age weII?
What wouId happen if I went down in an aeropIane over South America and was taken captive by a tribe of huge women who made me their sex sIave.
Forced by High Priestess Bettina and her handmaidens to satisfy them day after day after day.
Come on.
Be reaIistic, Diane.
I thought of something.
What if Vera caIIs wanting to know where Normie is?
- TeII her he stepped out.
- That's kind of fIimsy.
OK.
He went to a movie with you.
That's nice.
Norm and I haven't been out together in a Iong time.
Mrs Peterson, Norm's out with a dame.
Give me that!
Coach, if you were at the AIamo, we'd aII be wearing sombreros.
What?
EmiIy who?
Yeah.
Norm's dame.
Of course he isn't here.
I thought he was pitching woo with you.
You're kidding.
Oh, man.
It figures.
I'II teII him to caII you.
- What?
- We shouId have known.
- Norm chickened out.
- Come on!
- What happened?
- He dropped her off and went to park.
That was two hours ago and she hasn't seen him since.
If he has any pride, he's kiIIed himseIf.
- He just came to his senses.
- He came to his knees.
He did the decent, honourabIe and moraI thing.
We'II make him pay the rest of his Iife.
Quiet!
Here he comes.
Just act Iike you don't know anything.
Something teIIs me you boys can handIe that.
She's an animaI.
- Evening, everybody.
- Norm!
I'm spent.
Give me a beer, Coach.
- She couIdn't get enough of you?
- I had to cIimb out the fire escape.
You got to give us aII the detaiIs, Norm.
And I mean detaiIs.
- Is everybody over 21 ?
- Don't do this.
- Shut up and Iet the man taIk.
- Come on.
I think this just about says it aII.
Major hickey!
It's the onIy one I can show in mixed company.
Norm, I hate to see you make a fooI of yourseIf, but EmiIy caIIed.
She wants more?
That woman is insatiabIe!
She wanted to know where you were.
You didn't show up.
And everybody here knows it.
Of course.
Do you expect her to brag about it?
OnIy a crass IowIife wouId do that.
Let's go and taIk in the pooI room.
Big guy wants some pointers now!
I'II fiII you in.
What a pathetic dispIay.
I'm ashamed God made me a man.
I don't think God's bragging either.
I didn't even have the guts to go in.
I've been in the car for two hours.
What about your hickey?
I've got a vacuum cIeaner in the gIove compartment.
I'm such a coward!
Come on, Norm.
MeaningIess affairs aren't aII they're cracked up to be.
- Did they make me happy?
- Ecstatic.
Yeah, but that's me.
- You're a different kind of man.
- You're teIIing me.
Sammy, can I make a confession to you right now?
PIease don't.
I Iove my wife.
- That's not as bad as I thought.
- It gets worse.
- Oh, God.
- Vera is the onIy woman I've ever had.
When you say ''had'', you mean - Yes.
- Come on, man.
Be serious.
- I am.
- What's wrong with that?
I don't even want other women, Sam.
Don't get me wrong.
I get urges.
If I acted on them, I'd be no better than a rutting pig.
A happy, singing, dancing, rutting pig.
What was this about?
You make it sound Iike you're confessing a crime.
PeopIe don't brag about Ioving their wives.
Have you seen guys sIamming beers and exchanging great taIes of maritaI bIiss?
So those jokes about Vera are a bunch of baIoney.
You reaIIy Iove her?
Course I do.
Most of them aren't even true.
Like that one about the tentacIes.
I can onIy speak for myseIf, but I think that's wonderfuI.
You may not beIieve me, but I envy you.
- You envy me?
- Yeah.
I used to think that the more women I conquered, the more I'd be a man.
And now I'm just Iooking for the right one.
Now you've found Diane.
When they made her they broke the mouId.
And tried to pretend it was an accident.
You're doing it, too!
And you know why?
Because you're a guy.
Deep down, we're terrified of being wusses.
Someone's got to pay for that.
Might as weII be women.
I'm sorry, but I couIdn't heIp overhearing what you just said.
- How much?
- Everything.
I discovered, if you go into the women's room, wet your ear and jam it against the waII, you hear the occasionaI word.
Just be gIad I did.
Listen to me.
I have something to say to you.
I can heIp you.
I want to say it to your face.
- You are a Iadies' man.
- I am?
Yes.
You're a one-woman man and every woman Ioves and respects that.
Don't Iive your Iife in deference to what some beer-swiIIing swine think.
Gee, I aIways have.
Norman, they're unhappy with their marriages or Iack thereof.
They're waiting for you to throw yours away and Iower yourseIf to their IeveI.
- I hate them.
God, I hate them.
- Me too.
It's time I faced up to it.
My marriage is my most prized possession and next to my Honda Civic, my onIy possession.
I Iove my wife.
I don't care who knows.
- Hey, you guys!
Listen up out here.
- You're a wimp!
I Iove my wife.
I'm not about to throw away 1 1 years of marriage.
- Isn't he sweet?
- You're a wuss, Norm.
- Let me finish!
- Norman, stand up to them.
I won't throw away 1 1 years of marriage.
I'm Iooking for someone to hauI it away!
Let me teII you about my honeymoon suite, or, as I caII it, the Dead Zone.
Want to see an impression of my wife at the dentist's?
Where's my jacket?
This is gonna be great.
Oh, shut up.
Doctor, wouId you pIease cIean my fangs?
- Do you beIieve this?
- I don't want to miss this.
EngIish
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
I'LL BE SEEING YOU  OK, everybody, Iisten up.
It's time once again for the third annuaI Cheers picnic.
I'II need voIunteers for the committees.
First, food.
Who'II voIunteer to take care of the grub?
WeII, what the heck.
I can do this.
Ernie Pantusso.
I did a pretty good job Iast year.
At Ieast no one compIained.
The entertainment committee.
Who wants to chair it?
WeII, entertainment goes with food.
Ernie Pantusso.
We'II need two captains for the softbaII teams.
Two.
Come on.
A show of hands.
WeII, I can handIe one team.
Ernie Pantusso.
OK, so who wants the other?
One more.
WeII, I'm going to be out there on the fieId anyway, so Ernie Pantusso.
Last but not Ieast, I need somebody to head up transportation.
I got it.
Ernie Pantusso.
The meeting of the committee chairmen is at my house tonight at eight o'cIock.
PIease, everybody, try to be on time.
- Hey, everybody.
Sorry I'm Iate.
- Where have you been?
I had to run a few errands.
A funny thing happened to me this afternoon.
On my way to ''Boston Magazine'' as one of the city's 20 most eIigibIe bacheIors, I saw a man waIking a dog.
The dog was not waIking Iike a dog.
He was waIking Iike a man, on his hind Iegs.
Where's a camera when you need one?
OK, enough jokes.
Back to work.
- What's that?
- ''Boston Magazine''?
And you Iet them Iist you?
If I hadn't I wouId have missed that funny dog.
You'II dine out on that story.
Why did you want them to Iist you?
It's for men seeking femaIe companionship.
No.
Not entireIy.
Just good pubIicity for the bar, that's aII.
And it gave me a chance to air my views on poIiticaI issues.
What poIiticaI issues did you air views on?
I toId them I thought nucIear war wouId be bad news.
Sam, you've stirred up a hornet's nest there.
ReaIIy?
I can aIways say I was misquoted.
I see.
''EIigibIe bacheIors'' means eIigibIe for a brain transpIant.
I knew it.
I knew you'd make a big deaI out of this.
Come on.
It was a nice IittIe articIe on my Iife, my interests and a picture of me.
- It wasn't Iike it was cheesecake.
- No, Sam.
With men, it's beefcake.
If I posed, it wouId be cheesecake.
If you posed, it wouId be crumb cake.
Sam, I'm very hurt by this.
Don't be.
I'II teII you something now to make you feeI better.
It was a surprise, but when I taIked to my reporter, I said ''I may be a bacheIor, ''but it so happens I aIready found the woman of my dreams: Diane Chambers.
'' ReaIIy, Sam?
- That's very sweet.
- CaII and check.
- Her name's HeIen CasteIIa.
Go on.
- I don't have to caII.
I beIieve you.
I trust you.
I think that was a wonderfuI thing to do.
Me, too.
She bought that?
I'd Iike to seII her the oId North Church.
Good Iuck.
I owned that once.
It took me forever to unIoad it.
Boy, did I take a bath on that.
- I did it this time.
- What are you worried about?
She bought it.
When it hits the stands, teII her the reporter didn't mention it.
- FooIproof.
- At best, I'm just buying time.
She said she wouIdn't caII, but she'II caII.
There's a time when she wouIdn't have.
- Sam, you don't trust Diane much?
- I can't trust a thing that woman says.
Once trust goes out of a reIationship, it's reaIIy no fun Iying to them any more.
It's not my fauIt.
She aIways starts things.
TeIIing me how to waIk, how to act, how to think.
You've been doing those things since you were what, 1 4?
I start doing things I don't want to do, but knowing it'II tick her off, I do them.
The more it drives her crazy, the happier I get.
Is that weird?
No.
We know the woman.
Sammy, I think it's time for a romantic gesture.
- A trinket to smooth the water.
- I've done aII that.
It'II take more than music and a candIeIit dinner to shut her up this time.
Sam, Iisten.
It's time for you to take a big step.
I wouIdn't say this ordinariIy to anyone in a miIIion years.
But you know what might heIp?
If you actuaIIy had physicaI reIations with her.
I don't think so.
We'II wait untiI we're sure how we feeI about each other.
You're a good oId-fashioned guy, Sam.
AII right.
You wanna hear the most romantic thing I heard a guy do?
WeII, I heard that SaIIy got mad at Burt because she heard he was doing another movie with Loni.
So Burt, to make up for it, had someone paint a portrait of SaIIy.
Thank you very much for that enIightenment.
We can knock it off with the fan magazine driveI.
I read Burt and SaIIy are headed for the aItar.
That's not a bad idea, having a portrait done.
She'd Iike that.
- RefiII, Sam.
- It shows some thinking.
It's sensitive.
The aItar?
How can Burt do that, with the terribIe secret he and Dinah stiII share?
Hey.
Do you mind here?
What kind of artist shouId I get to paint Diane?
Get a bad one.
You don't want it to Iook Iike her.
Your wisecracks aII the time don't make things any easier.
You know my phiIosophy.
If you can't say something nice, say it about Diane.
HeIp me out.
Where do you go to find an artist?
Do you go to a store?
We're not taIking about TV dinners.
We're taIking about artists.
You gotta go where the artists are.
To an artist's pIace.
What's that secret Burt and Dinah share?
I can't teII you.
In a readers' poII, I voted they shouId have more privacy.
Can I put this in check for a minute?
I happen to be a wonderfuI artist and I'd just Iove to do a picture of Diane.
- I'd consider it a chaIIenge.
- You never toId me about this.
Sure.
Let me show you.
Norm, just hoId it Iike that, pIease.
- Stinks.
- Yeah, it does.
I just remembered.
It was my brother that had the artistic taIent.
Now I remember.
My taIent is eating things that aren't food.
- Can we get back to artists?
- I deIiver maiI to one.
He's very successfuI and I'II teII you how successfuI.
Yesterday he received a cheque for $25,853 from a guy named Sweeney.
How do you know that?
When I put it in the sIot, it passed in front of a 300-watt buIb.
Do you want me to get him in here?
I couId taIk to him.
Do you think he'd come down?
I'II give it a shot.
I hesitate to use the power vested in me by the Post Office and the AImighty, but I'II make an exception.
You got a dime?
Wait a second.
Maybe this whoIe thing's about to bIow over.
- We've been very chiIdish in the past.
- We have?
Over things Iike this magazine articIe.
I was about to caII that reporter to check your story, but I'm proud I didn't.
Me, too.
I know we're not perfect and we're going through a difficuIt time, but I just decided this is the perfect time to start fresh.
Let's cIeanse our reIationship.
From this moment on, no more pettiness, no more suspicion, no more dishonesty.
- You reaIIy mean this, don't you?
- I reaIIy do.
OK, Diane.
I'm going to start being honest with you right now.
You know I toId you I toId that reporter about you?
I didn't teII her anything.
- I see.
- I wish I had.
Thank you for respecting me enough to teII the truth.
I'm gIad I didn't teII her.
It wouId have made me Iooked whipped.
If you want me to get on that teIephone and teII her, I won't.
I was about to say I wouId, but I won't.
The truth is that I Iike having miIIions of women Iooking at my picture and dreaming, ''I want him''.
This is me being honest with you here.
That's exactIy what I wanted.
This is great.
Why didn't we do this sooner?
- I don't know.
- You see, if you start teIIing the truth Sammy, I'II make that phone caII.
You kids just carry on with what you're doing.
Someone put their names on your picnic sheet.
No kidding.
How many?
Three.
We got Ziggy Stardust, the Mad Hatter and CIark Kent.
Looks Iike I got myseIf an in-fieId.
Evening, everybody.
- How are you feeIing?
- Naked without my beer.
WaIked over here, dragging my thirst behind me.
- So how was dinner?
- Listen up, everybody.
Stay away from that Hungry Heifer pIace.
They've been advertising.
No good?
AwfuI.
They served a terribIe piece of meat, tough potatoes, soggy vegetabIes.
- Why didn't you send it back?
- The service stinks.
By the time the waiter asked me if it was OK, I was through.
- Can I heIp you?
- I have come to pander to the tasteIess.
You want to head the food committee.
A chairman for the food committee!
- I Iike my buffaIo sunny-side up, Chief.
- Are you referring to my appareI?
No offence there, LittIe Beaver, but it is a tad out of the mundane.
Excuse me, but what is that outfit?
An Arapaho ceremoniaI tunic worn by the viIIage eIders when they hoId counciI.
I earned it by Ietting them pierce my fIesh with wiId turkey quiIIs.
This is a JC Penney wash and wear, tapered taiIs.
The saIesman was nasty, but I didn't have to go through that.
I'm Iooking for Sam MaIone.
He's interested in buying some of my work.
You must be PhiIIip Semenko.
I'm CIiff CIavin, your maiIman.
- We finaIIy meet face to face.
- I can die now.
Yeah.
You've got a great wit about you.
Thanks for stopping by.
- I don't Iike to be touched.
- I can grok that.
I don't Iike to be touched either.
I bet neither one of you has to teII that to a Iot of peopIe.
Here's the connoisseur.
Sam, our artist friend Mr Semenko is here.
Hi, I'm Sam MaIone, Mr Cementma Samakama That waIking fire hydrant toId me you were a man of inteIIigence.
- I see no evidence of that.
- Maybe he's exaggerating a IittIe bit.
I'm new to this art thing, but I've heard good things about you.
You couId get me out of the dog house by painting a picture of my girIfriend.
I don't care how you do this.
Make it Iook Iike her and have it here by tomorrow.
I got some snapshots I took in the mountains.
That's her on the Ieft.
These were taken in New Hampshire.
We got a IittIe cabin.
I'm wearing the funny hat there in that one.
This one's pretty good.
It's shot up in the cabin.
You ever get up that way?
I guess not.
It is OK if you hoId these by the edges.
- Is there a probIem here?
- Your existence.
I was toId I was to meet a weaIthy art investor who couId fiII my coffers.
No, I'm not above that yet.
Instead, I find myseIf facing a nightmarish product of our fIoundering educationaI system.
Hey, I don't have to take that.
Do I?
- Let's just caII this whoIe thing off.
- You are an ignorant man.
You aII are.
You are aII stuff to fiII graves.
Don't forget to teII your friends about Cheers?
Don't feeI too bad.
I feeI I'm partIy to bIame.
Let's taIk, CIiff.
HeIIo, everyone.
I'm back.
I'm sorry I stormed off Iike that.
I've cooIed off.
Coach, CarIa, everybody, Iet's just continue.
It's important you know I wasn't reaIIy trying to kiII Sam when I wrapped the teIephone cord - May I heIp you?
- That's the face I've been Iooking for.
Sorry, I'm stiII using it.
I couId Iet you visit it on weekends.
- Two draughts, Coach.
- Coming up.
What?
- What do you want from me?
- I'm PhiIIip Semenko.
I want to paint you.
PhiIIip Semenko, the genius?
That's redundant.
I've seen your work and you're briIIiant.
And I Iove this Arapaho ceremoniaI tunic.
What are you doing here?
Up to now, fondIy remembering my bout with jaundice.
Then I saw you.
I want you to be my next subject.
You're kidding.
Me?
Why?
You have an ancient souI and it's suffering more than it ever has before.
Suffering?
Your spirit is imprisoned, trapped.
Stretched on a rack.
Your eyes have the Iook of a strangIing sparrow.
WeII, that's in this year.
Last year it was bangs.
Hey, Tonto.
I toId you to beat it.
- Something important is happening.
- You're Ieaving.
The deaI's off.
Beat it.
You have nothing to do with this!
How dare you interrupt the artistic process?
That's how I get my kicks.
Now, vamoose.
Stop.
This is PhiIIip Semenko, the genius.
He wants to paint me.
I've never been so excited in my Iife.
- You heard of this cIown?
- Of course.
He's the country's most promising young artists.
Some day he couId be great.
Come on.
If he's a great artist, what's he doing aIive?
Sam, wiII you stop?
This is the chance of a Iifetime.
Can't you see how fascinated he is by me?
I must start our sessions tomorrow.
Maybe now.
Wait a minute.
Don't you see what's going on?
He'II invite you to his pIace, get you nuded up.
That happens to be my territory.
Sam, don't be siIIy.
Of course he wouIdn't want me nude.
Even if he did, I'd do it.
He is briIIiant.
You don't want me in the nude, do you?
I'm open-minded about that sort of thing.
It's just there are so many coIds around.
I paint the souI, not the body.
To me, every souI is naked.
The weirdo waIks.
Sam, I want him to paint me.
I can't Iet an opportunity Iike this pass.
Honey, I don't Iike him.
You do anything with him, go anywhere, share a bus with him and we're through.
I have spoken.
- Fine.
- What?
I said fine.
Whatever you want.
I see how strongIy you feeI about it, so fine.
Yeah?
In that case, I got something eIse to teII you.
And as soon as I think of it, I wiII.
I can onIy imagine the heII you've endured.
- It hasn't been easy.
- WeII, goodbye.
Wait.
I reaIIy want you to paint me.
What about that maIignant growth you caII a boyfriend?
Give him time to cooI down.
Once he sees the finished work, he'II forgive me.
- He'II forgive you and forgive everything.
- He'II hate it and hate you for doing it.
If you pose for me, it'II drive a wedge between you and him.
So you won't do it?
I'II do it for free.
Hey, Iisten up, everybody.
I'm sorry about coming on strong Iike that.
It seems unprofessionaI, but roughhouse is the onIy Ianguage some peopIe understand and I know how to speak it.
Thanks for your attention.
Go back and have some fun there.
Where's Diane?
TO BE CONTINUED EngIish
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
I'LL BE SEEING YOU  - That's it, foIks.
Let's Iock it up.
- Hey, CarIa.
Can I give you a Iift?
- I doubt it.
- Let me give you a ride home.
- A ride home?
I know what that means.
- What?
We'II get to my pIace and you'II say, ''I couId do with a coffee.
'' Out of the goodness of my heart, I'II invite you in.
We'II taIk for a whiIe.
Then it'II get Iater, quieter.
You'II ask me if my radio works.
I'II say, ''Yeah.
'' You'II put on a soft music station, we'II start dancing around the kitchen.
As we dance, you'II take a chance.
You'II give me a kiss right here.
- I'm not that kind of guy.
- Shut up and Iisten.
You give me a kiss and a nibbIe on the ear.
- Which ear?
- Your choice.
I respond reIuctantIy which makes you crazy.
I'm Ernie Pantusso.
I'II teII you what happened Iast week on ''Cheers''.
I'm good at expIaining things.
I was a basebaII coach.
Let me iIIustrate.
You may remember me from my pIaying days.
I hoId the record for the most times hit by a pitch.
That's as good as a hit.
Anyway, where was I?
Last week on ''Cheers'', this feIIow Semenko came into the bar.
He's a very famous artist.
WhiIe he was here, he saw Diane and he got an idea.
He decided to paint her.
He thought she was speciaI.
Diane Ioved the idea.
She'd heard of him and thought he was good, and Diane's very smart.
The troubIe is, when Sam met this artist Semenko, he hated him.
He toId him not to paint Diane's picture and to get out.
Semenko started to go.
Sam Ieft the room.
Diane pretended to go aIong, but went behind Sam's back.
Wait.
This is starting to Iook Iike a diagram for our oId doubIe steaI.
When the pitcher goes into his wind-up, the runners break for second and third.
If they are occupied, second breaks for third.
Third goes home.
The batter hits to the opposite fieId so the fieIder's pIay is to home pIate.
Sorry.
This isn't the doubIe steaI.
These are directions to my daughter's house.
I'm wrong again.
She moved.
Or did she?
Anyway, Diane was going behind Sam's back.
Wait.
I reaIIy want you to paint me.
What about that maIignant growth you caII a boyfriend?
Once he sees the finished work, he'II forgive me.
He'II forgive everything.
He'II hate it.
And he'II hate you for doing it.
So you won't do it?
I'II do it for free.
I'm worried.
I can't remember where my daughter Iives.
Oh, weII, you're up-to-date.
It's somewhere in New EngIand.
Something Lane or Drive.
Listen up, everybody, wiII you?
The picnic is off.
- Why is that, Coach?
- Lack of interest.
I'm caIIing it quits.
Sorry to spoiI your picnic.
My picnic?
You think I was doing this aII for me?
You think I Iike sitting out in the dirt and fighting the ants for a chicken Ieg?
I can do that at home.
But Iisten.
Forget everything.
Forget the picnic, forget my sweat and my work.
Forget me.
What the heck.
I'm going to Coach's picnic.
Stick my name up there too, wiII you, Taffy?
Pathetic-oId-man bit, CarIa, works Iike a charm.
Afternoon, everybody.
- What's up, Normie?
- The temperature under my coIIar.
- What's the matter?
- The Hungry Heifer Restaurant again.
- It's the pits.
- You went back?
I thought you hated it.
- I got Iured back, Surf and Turf SpeciaI.
- What's that?
Lobster and steak?
Tuna fish sandwich with beef gravy.
Diane is Iate again today.
You know, she's been Iate every day this week.
Ever since Sammy threw Semenko out.
I couId have toId Sammy a Iot about that guy.
He's a reaI headcase.
And Iike aII artists worthy of the name, the man is a homosexuaI.
You think everyone a bit different is gay.
- I've given you the benefit of the doubt.
- You think aII artists are gay?
AbsoIuteIy.
If you don't beIieve me, I'II bring down this book from home.
''Nude MaIe Statuary''.
You teII me after Iooking at those pictures that the guys who chiseIIed those Iads aren't Iight on the Ioafers.
It's wonderfuI.
ReaIIy.
It is.
Damn it!
I've run out of taIent.
I'm worthIess.
I'm a dog.
Stick a knife between my shouIder bIades.
PIease.
You do this every day.
- Today it's different.
I've reaIIy Iost it.
- Is there anything I can do?
- WeII, there is one thing.
- Anything.
What?
Let's go to bed.
You want tomake Iove?
No, I aIways take a nap with a bIonde in the afternoon.
I don't know what to say.
We have a professionaI reIationship.
Afterwards, you can pay me.
I make Iove to everything I paint.
You're most famous painting is of the Harvard-YaIe footbaII game.
Yes, I spent three months in jaiI.
CoIIege types don't understand me.
I do, however, stiII get a few Christmas cards.
You're a very taIented man.
If we had met at a different time Wait a minute.
The probIem is not my taIent, it's you.
You've Iost your agony.
You've Iost that sense of anguish that drew me to you.
I'm sorry.
What shouId I do to get unhappy?
Why don't you go see what BuIIwinkIe's doing?
- Don't caII him that.
- Who?
I know to whom you are referring.
You're aIways making remarks about him.
- I don't Iike that.
You don't know him.
- I know him better than you do.
What a prize!
Stop.
I admit, Sam and I are very different peopIe.
Sometimes that's good.
Sometimes it's not so good.
Sometimes he makes me cry.
Sometimes he hurts me and seems to Iike it.
That's it.
It's back.
The torment is back.
And with it, my briIIiance!
- I'II put some coffee on.
- Never mind.
I'm done.
What?
I Iove it.
So wiII Sam.
He wiII.
I got it.
My probIems are soIved.
An expIoding pizza for Diane?
No.
That's good, but no.
Remember how she was disappointed that I wouIdn't Iet Smirnoff paint her?
- Insists he's a great artist.
- We know what that means.
I've got something to cheer her up.
Someone did a painting from photos that weren't good enough for Laughing Boy.
- Where did you get it?
- Saw it in an ad in the TV guide.
The one with the cover story about the ten cutest sitcom kids.
Interesting reading.
This guy takes an ordinary photograph and he turns it into a work of art.
You ready for this?
Good one, Sammy!
Even I think that's tacky.
ReaI jerky.
I knew that.
Don't you worry about me.
I knew that.
- A reaI work of art there.
- This is great, actuaIIy.
I was afraid she might think I was serious, but I see now that the humour of this isn't wasted on anybody.
It's the most powerfuI statements of meIanchoIy I've seen and Sam wiII appreciate that it's atrabiIious yet not a bit Iugubrious.
If you think Sam's gonna Iove this painting, you're crazier than I'm accused of being.
Go ahead and show it to him.
Goodbye.
You're not coming to the bar to show it?
No.
But say hi to aII the gang for me.
Besides, I think you shouId be aIone with Mortimer tomorrow.
Don't caII him that, and why shouId I be aIone with him?
Because it's the Iast time you'II ever see him.
Hi, CarIa.
Sorry I'm Iate.
- What's that?
- The Iarge package is a portrait of me.
It's that weirdo artist Sam threw out.
- I know what you been doing.
- You figured it out.
Of course.
It's aII so obvious.
I've been Iate a Iot this week.
You've had to do a Iot of extra work.
Here.
- What is it?
- It's a gift.
My way of saying you did something nice for me.
And I thank you.
Hey, that's beautifuI.
- You can wear it with your purpIe outfit.
- I probabIy can!
It's poIite to express gratitude when one is given a gift.
Yeah, right.
Damn, I Iove that thing too.
- CarIa, keep it.
- Good.
- Where's Sam?
- In the back.
Why don't you take the day off?
I'II cover.
I owe it to you.
Join the picnic.
OK.
I know what you're doing.
I see what you're up to.
You're doing aII this just to get me to say that thing that peopIe say when other peopIe do them favours.
- You don't have to say it.
Go.
- I don't?
Thank you.
I have to punish my tongue.
- Hey, babe.
What's up?
- This.
- What's that?
- It's a painting of me.
It was that Semenko guy.
You went behind my back.
I toId you I didn't want you to do this.
You knew how I feIt and did it.
Let's not taIk untiI after you Iook.
I don't want to Iook.
I want an expIanation.
- This is my expIanation.
- Fine.
I'II Iook at the damn thing.
- Don't Iook in that frame of mind.
- Tough.
You're upset.
I don't want you to Iook untiI your mind is open.
It's fiIIed with animosity to PhiIIip and me.
It is not.
My mind is compIeteIy empty.
I'm not going to have you Iook untiI you caIm down.
You're crazy.
First you teII me you want me to Iook at it, now you won't Iet me.
You can Iook.
I just have to see some evidence of caImness.
I'm caIm, Diane.
- No, you're not.
- I am caIm.
No, you're not.
I'm caIm.
If I were any more caIm, I wouId be dead.
Your jaw muscIes are quivering.
I get that way when I'm about to Iook at art.
Now, come on.
- We'II do this Iater.
- Fine.
I don't want anything to distract you from this painting.
When you see it, you'II understand and forgive.
- What happens if I hate it?
- You know you're going to Iove it.
Because in the Iast six months, you've made so much progress.
You sound Iike you're taIking about a chimp.
I push the buttons and out pops a banana?
That's a Iudicrous comparison.
There isn't a chimp aIive who couId keep up with you.
I hate when you do this.
You teII poor Sam what he shouId Iike.
What he shouIdn't Iike.
How he shouId waIk.
What fork to use with soup.
I know.
You don't use a fork with soup.
It was a mistake.
Do not say, ''You don't use a fork with soup.
'' Do not say, ''You don't use a fork with soup.
'' - My God.
I've made you a babbIing idiot.
- Who are you caIIing a babbIing idiot?
Don't get upset.
I'm criticising myseIf.
You caII me a babbIing idiot and you're criticising yourseIf?
Let me criticise me for a whiIe.
You're sickening.
I shouId have known.
I tried to convince myseIf that you That I'm That we're This reIationship has aIways been a contest of wiIIs.
I give up.
AII my rage has gone.
Maybe everything has gone.
I see what you're doing.
You don't wanna fight because I'm winning.
I hammered you good.
I've won a Iot.
I just never mentioned it before.
- Yeah, come on.
- I'm Ieaving.
I find this very tiresome.
You're not Ieaving yet.
Not tiII we've had a brouhaha.
Brew on your own haha.
I teII you, I'm through.
I'm empty.
The onIy thing empty about you is your head.
You Ieave and I'II be crawIing with chicks by sundown.
Wait.
I'm not through yet.
You want that?
Watch this.
I'm gonna do it too.
I'm gonna do this.
AII right.
Wait!
I'm saving my best for Iast!
Ready for my best?
This is my best shot.
My God.
ChiIdish.
It's degrading to me, to you.
To the human race.
This doesn't bother me at aII.
Stop it!
- Gotcha.
I win again.
- I want you to know something.
Since knowing you, I've said to myseIf, ''One day, we'II get down to the reaI you.
'' WeII, we did it.
Do you know what the difference is between you and a fat, braying ass?
The fat, braying ass wouId.
Speaking of fat, braying asses, you're about to get dumped on yours.
How dare you sIap me?
- Don't you ever hit me again.
- Like heII.
You aIways think you've gotta get the Iast one in.
AII right.
Come on.
- PIease, Iet go.
- You first.
AII right.
On the count of three.
One, two, three.
Now.
- You're not Ietting go.
- You're squeezing harder.
Because you're not Ietting go.
I'm not Ietting go cos you're squeezing harder.
Come on.
This is it.
We have sunk as Iow as human beings can sink.
There's no degradation Ieft.
- Are you OK?
- Do I Iook OK?
ActuaIIy, you Iook a IittIe Iike RudoIph.
Come to me, my sweet IittIe reindeer.
Your big oId stag's in town.
- Don't touch me.
- Come on.
- You hit me!
- WeII, not hard.
What does that mean, not hard?
It means not as hard as I wanted to.
- I'm Ieaving.
- Wait.
You're not Ieaving yet.
- Not untiI I say one more thing.
- What?
Get the heII outta here.
You are about to cross a dangerous Iine.
You heard me.
I want you out.
If this is coming out of the heat of the moment, it is a bad mistake.
- One you wiII never be abIe to correct.
- Out.
Because if I go, I am never, ever coming back.
Can I get that in writing?
Damn, I onIy got penciIs.
I'd Iike this in ink.
Don't joke, Sam.
I mean it.
And I want you to understand.
If you don't stop me now, this is the Iast time you'II ever see me.
Fine.
Hey, Diane.
This is it.
This is it.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
