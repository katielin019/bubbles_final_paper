{START OF EPISODE 1}
Thank you for being a friend  Traveled down the road and back again  Your heart is true  You're a pal and a confidant  And if you threw a party  Invited everyone you knew  You would see  The biggest gift would be from me  And the card attached would say  Thank you for being a friend  Here Blanche, you can add this to the pile.
You're not serious.
You're not giving this dress to the rummage sale.
This is the best looking outfit you own.
You're right.
I still look damn good in this thing.
Well, I don't know about "damn good".
That design does tend to accentuate your behind while simultaneously diminishing your cleavage.
Wait just a minute.
First you tell me this is my prettiest outfit, then you tell me I don't look very good in it.
Now, which one is the truth?
Both.
Look on the bright side, honey.
How often do you get out of your robe on the weekends?
I finished loading the cartons into the car.
Well, thank you Daisy, darling.
It's very sweet of you to give up your Saturday to help with this fundraiser.
That's what being a Sunshine Cadet is all about.
I know, I so admire your motto: "Spread it around".
That's sunshine, Blanche.
"Spread sunshine around".
Whatever.
Daisy, Mrs. Nylund put some things out on her bed.
Would you bring them in here?
- Sure, Mrs. Devereaux.
- Thank you.
- Ma, where you going?
- Down to the boardwalk.
I like to sit and watch the old guys rearrange themselves when they come out of the water.
Where are you going?
I'm off to the rummage sale.
Would you like a ride?
No, I wanna do cartwheels for six miles.
Get your keys, let's roll.
- Here are Mrs. Nylund's things.
- Put them here.
Thank you.
I can't believe she's giving away this teddy bear.
I wish I could afford to buy him at the sale.
- You like him?
- I think he's the cutest thing I've ever seen in my whole life.
Well, then I'm gonna give him to you.
He's yours.
Oh, thank you, Mrs. Devereaux.
Thank you!
Thank you!
You're welcome.
- Hi, Mrs. Nylund.
- Hi, Daisy.
Bye, Daisy.
- That was Daisy, wasn't it?
- Yes.
She's been helping out the entire time you've been gone.
It's just so inspiring, the way those Sunshine Cadets volunteer for community service.
You know, back home, we didn't have a community organization for females.
Unless you count Miss Maggie's house on the hill.
Those girls would stand on their heads for you.
Course I heard that cost you ten bucks extra.
Blanche!
Have you seen my teddy bear, Fernando?
He's missing.
I've had him since I was six years old.
I have to find him.
- I just have to.
- Calm down.
He's just a toy.
Fernando is not just a toy.
He's a family heirloom.
I've had him for as long as I can remember.
I don't know what I'd do without him.
Rose.
Rose, now don't panic.
Look, we'll find him.
All we need is a logical plan.
You go check out the attic and I'll look around outside in case he wandered off.
Good.
I feel better now.
At least we have a plan.
Someone sitting here?
Cataracts or glaucoma?
I can see there's no one sitting here.
- I was just being polite.
- If you say so.
Me, I've got both.
Cataracts and glaucoma.
The glaucoma I handle with drops.
For the cataracts, I had surgery.
They used laser beams on me.
Zap, zap.
Just like that.
No more cataracts.
- Dynamite.
- You black?
Laser beams, huh?
Gimme a break, you geezer.
The sun's reflecting off the sand.
Who you calling an old geezer?
What am I, Kreskin?
How should I know what your name is?
If you didn't have your eyes zapped with some ray gun, you could read it off my identification badge here.
"Alvin Newcastle.
Security guard".
That's right.
Why didn't you just buy the one that says, "Marshal, Dodge City".
This happens to be a legitimate, officially authorized identification badge.
Issued by the police department direct.
And I happen to be a legitimate for real security guard.
Well, you're doing a great job, Alvin Newcastle.
Nobody stole the boardwalk since you've been sitting here.
Just forget it.
It's my fault for trying to be friendly.
I'll go back to counting seagulls.
So where do you work?
A bank, a department store?
Ocean Mist Retirement Hotel.
Sundays, noon to one.
Ocean Mist.
You know Molly Feinberg?
I don't think so.
Wait a minute, you mean Molly Feinbaum.
I'm wrong, I'm wrong.
Ocean View, not Ocean Mist.
Finestein, that's it.
Gray hair, glasses.
Or is it Ocean Spray?
Well, that's a cranberry juice.
- Definitely Ocean Terrace.
- Definitely Feinstein.
Except she pronounces it "Feinstine".
Harriet Feinstein.
You want me to say hello for you?
Would you mind?
We're very close.
No problem.
Hey, Alvin.
I have an enormous veal and pepper sandwich here.
I couldn't possibly finish it.
You want half?
I made it fresh this morning.
Sounds more interesting than the tangerine I got.
Prepare yourself for a real treat.
Hey.
I don't even know your name.
Sophia.
Sophia Petrillo.
Italian?
Take one bite of the sandwich and you tell me.
Hey, I didn't hear you get up.
I never went to sleep.
Now look, Rose, this has to stop.
Now you have been carrying on for a week.
It was only a toy animal.
Fernando was more than that.
He was full of life, he was full of love He was full of stuffing, Rose.
Now look, you've got to get a grip on yourself.
I'm sorry.
I know I'm behaving like a fool.
But I got a right to sing the blues.
I lost my teddy.
I understand, Rose.
Which, if I thought about it, says something deeply disturbing about me.
"I've got a right to sing the blues"?
Dorothy, I hope you didn't fix breakfast for me.
I'm not eating home this morning.
Someone's buying me breakfast.
- Someone?
- Okay, okay.
Quit badgering me.
- It's Alvin.
- Alvin from the boardwalk?
No Rose, Alvin from the Chipmunks.
Girls, guess what I found.
Fernando.
That's not Fernando.
What do you mean, "that's not Fernando"?
How could you tell?
All you have to do is look in his eyes.
Or at the price tag stuck to his back.
- Oops!
- Thanks for trying, Blanche.
It's nice to know I have a friend like you who cares.
Dorothy.
I have a confession to make.
Rose didn't lose Fernando.
I gave him to Daisy when she was helping out with the rummage sale.
Well, then, there's no problem, honey.
Just call Daisy and get Fernando back.
She's a very sweet kid.
She'll understand.
I tried that.
She said no.
What do you mean?
She's not a sweet kid anymore.
She's holding Fernando for ransom.
- Come on.
- Dorothy, she sent me one of his ears.
- I think I got one.
- Where?
Past the lifeguard stand.
- Bald guy about 20 yards out?
- Yeah.
Yeah, watch his face.
Huh?
Am I right?
You got one, no doubt about it.
That gentleman just peed in the ocean.
How many is that today?
Three?
Four?
I'm not sure.
I lost track.
Whatever.
My point is, there's always something interesting happening at the beach.
But then again, I've always been a beach person.
Not my Salvador.
- Salvador?
- My husband.
You have a husband?
Departed, I told you about him.
Anyway, Salvador hated the beach.
He said too many people peed in the ocean.
What about your Edna?
Edna?
Did she like the beach?
You ever notice the birds?
I'm asking you about your late wife, you're asking me about birds?
At the park, they want you to feed them, but here they take care of themselves.
Here they could die for clams casino, what's your point?
I don't know.
I'm asking about Edna.
- Edna?
- Your wife.
Oh, hey.
I'm sorry, I I guess I just can't take a hint.
There's some things about Salvador I still have trouble talking about.
Of course, other things I'm not allowed to talk about unless I want the Scarpoli family to put out a contract on me.
Hey, I I made up that last part, trying to lighten the moment.
I I'm sorry, Alvin.
Don't cry.
That's okay.
You cry all you want.
Daisy, honey, be reasonable.
Now why won't you give the bear back?
Because he belongs to me.
He does not belong to you, sweetheart.
No, he belongs to Rose.
She gave him to me.
But honey, I had no right to do that.
You mean, you made a mistake?
Yes, that's all it was, just a silly mistake.
In Sunshine Cadets, we learn you have to pay for your mistakes.
This one's gonna cost you a ten-speed Schwinn.
Daisy.
Didn't the Sunshine Cadets teach you anything about honesty and decency and respect for your elders?
I think that was scheduled for the weekend campout at Lake Wakatake.
I missed it, when I was grounded for catching a smoke in the boys' john.
Dorothy, we're shafted.
Think you could have the bike by this weekend?
Listen, Daisy, I don't like being intimidated, I do not like being threatened and frankly, kid, I don't like you.
I am not gonna buy you anything, and I am going to tell your folks what you're doing and then I'm going to call the school for bad girls and they will come and pick you up and put you in a sack and take you away and you will never eat ice cream or play jump rope again.
Get real, grandma.
Either way, I'll get the bike.
My folks will feel terrible because two mean old ladies forced me to return my toy.
And because it was ruined in the accident on the way back to their house.
- Accident?
- See this water pistol?
It's loaded with red ink.
-  Hi, everybody.
- Rose, don't move.
She's got the teddy bear and a water pistol.
What?
Rose, it won't sound any less ridiculous if you hear it again.
You found my teddy.
Where was he?
- You didn't tell her?
- Tell me what?
I think the price just went up.
I'll get back to you within 48 hours.
What's going on?
Where did she take Fernando?
She took him home, Rose.
Rose, see, honey, Fernando doesn't exactly belong to you anymore.
I kind of gave him to Daisy by mistake.
Get him back.
- I want my teddy.
- Honey, she's just a child.
You can't expect a child to give back a toy.
Now you do understand, don't you?
Just cut the crap and get back the damn bear.
Where you been?
Know what time it is?
- 9:00.
- In your dreams.
You take the wrong bus again?
Never mind, you didn't miss anything.
- What do you think you're doing?
- I think I'm crocheting but to tell you the God's honest truth, I wouldn't swear to it.
This is my seat.
You're sitting in my seat.
Excuse me, I didn't know your I sit in this seat every day.
You got no right sitting in my seat.
Relax!
I'm moving.
You're always doing this kind of thing.
You're never thinking about anybody but yourself.
What are you talking about?
You know what I'm talking about.
I didn't take the wrong bus.
That dumb-ass driver went the wrong way.
A different way, and you know it!
What the hell's the matter with you?
Alvin.
Alvin.
Morning, Sophia.
What are you doing?
I'm levitating, Rose.
Get lost.
Aw, come back here.
You didn't deserve that.
You're a good kid.
I'm just a little depressed.
Really?
You know, I'm depressed too.
What are you depressed about?
Alvin and I had a fight.
I'm making a scarf for a friend I don't have anymore.
I know exactly how you feel.
I made these for Fernando.
I thought you broke up with that midget.
Fernando's not a midget.
He's my oldest and closest friend.
I didn't know Alvin long but I thought we were getting close.
I can't believe he just walked away.
Fernando was always there for me.
Whenever I was scared or down about something, I'd just roll over and snuggle up against him in bed.
I never went to bed with Alvin.
The thought never crossed my mind which is odd because I've always wondered about that myth.
There's a myth about people named Alvin?
The myth about black men in the bedroom.
Is that a Greek myth?
Get the door, Rose.
- You.
- Good morning.
Well, kid, what do you want?
I changed my mind.
I was wrong to ask for all those gifts.
Dorothy, you see, I knew she'd come to her senses.
I decided cash is better.
That way I can buy exactly what I want.
I'll get my purse.
No.
Blanche, I'm not gonna let you do that.
I've been doing a lot of thinking and if after all the years of love and companionship Fernando and I are meant to part company I'll just have to accept that.
Time to time, life deals you an unfriendly hand.
There's nothing you can do about it.
I guess there's a lesson to be learned here.
Sometimes, life just isn't fair, kiddo.
- Morning.
- Alvin.
Am I sitting in the right place?
Depends.
If you looking to catch a bus to Jacksonville, you could be in big trouble.
You old geezer, you know what I'm talking about.
Half the time I suspect you don't know what you're talking about.
Especially when you start all that muttering in Italian.
I swear, you make up half those words.
Here.
I brought you this.
Because you're sorry?
Because I'm thirsty and I figured you might be too.
Whatever.
They're really quite a pair, aren't they?
Excuse me?
My father and your mother.
They sit like that all day, every day.
He's even started referring to my husband as "that dumb badgagaloop".
How did you How'd you know that she was my mother.
Just a guess.
From the way you were watching.
After what happened yesterday, I thought you might show up.
He told you about the fight?
No, I saw it.
I was here.
Well, there doesn't seem to be any problem now.
I thought you said this was a cold drink.
It's lukewarm.
I told him no ice.
You dumb badgagaloop.
What do you think makes it cold?
Your attitude is making me cold, woman.
So lighten up and say thank you.
- All right, thank you.
- What?
Thank you for the soda.
I guess we're even.
This fight was my fault.
Yesterday was yours.
Yesterday?
Hey, if you're willing to forget about it, so am I. He has his good days and he has his bad days.
You just never know what to expect.
No, I understand.
My mother can be the same way.
I guess it's just part of getting older.
Some of it.
But my father isn't going to get any better.
He's only gonna get worse.
So that's when the salesman from men's sportswear walks clear across the store into lady's petite and says, "Excuse me, Miss.
I notice you've been having a hard time deciding between the turquoise strapless and the flaming red backless.
Well, personally, I would like to see you in the backless".
And I said, "When"?
And he said, "How about Saturday night"?
And I said, "How about in your dreams, sleazo"?
Can you believe the nerve of that guy?
What were you doing in lady's petite?
-  Ma?
- Come in.
I'm glad you're home.
Got a minute?
- Sure.
- Good.
Crochet me a scarf.
Ma, I need to talk to you about Alvin.
He's sick, Ma.
What are you talking about?
You've never seen him.
I've seen him, Ma.
After you had that fight, I was worried about you and I followed you to the boardwalk.
That was you?
Thank God.
I thought Gino the Enforcer was out on parole.
Ma, please.
Will you let me say what I have to say?
Maybe I don't want to hear what you have to say.
Maybe I'm happy not knowing anything.
Or maybe you know already.
I'm not stupid.
I could see there was something that wasn't right.
Ma, he has Alzheimer's disease.
I met his daughter down at the boardwalk.
She said that when he first started wandering off, she followed him everywhere.
She took a leave of absence from her job to take care of him.
But she's not gonna be able to afford that much longer.
Uh, the family's discussed sending him to New York.
He has a nephew who's a doctor there and can give him special care.
And Ma, Sandra says that within the next couple of months, they're gonna do that.
You know, Dorothy, people think if you live to be my age, you should be grateful just to be alive.
Well, that's not how it works.
You need a reason to get up in the morning.
And sometimes even after you find one, life can turn right around and spit in your face.
I'm sorry, Ma.
A few months, huh?
That should give me enough time to finish the scarf.
Ma?
Dorothy.
How long have you been here?
A while.
He's not coming back, is he?
No.
It was a nice couple of months.
I'll miss him.
Think he'll remember me?
I don't know.
I'll remember him.
I finished the scarf, you know.
Oh, great.
Next time we go to New York, maybe you'll take it to him.
Nah, I think I'll mail it.
That way, I'll always picture him right here on the boardwalk.
Hey!
Someone's sitting there!
- 5@y3 -
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Thank you for being a friend  Traveled down the road and back again  Your heart is true  You're a pal and a confidant  And if you threw a party  Invited everyone you knew  You would see  The biggest gift would be from me  And the card attached would say  Thank you for being a friend  - Hi, Rose.
- We brought dinner.
- What'd you get?
- A bucket of chicken.
I hope you like it extra flat and crispy.
It's a pizza, Rose.
I knew that, I just meant what kind?
- Did you really know that?
- No.
But I thought I could cover.
I'm glad you're all here.
I want you to try something.
Here, taste this.
- What do you think?
- It's water.
I didn't ask you to identify it, I asked you what you thought.
- It's good.
- Just good?
Very good.
How would you describe the taste?
- Refreshing, clear, clean - Would you buy this water?
- Sure, why not?
- Absolutely.
We're rich.
We're rich.
It comes from the hose out back.
Move over Perrier, Petrillo water is on the way.
- Ma - I know what you're gonna say.
Another one of my get-rich-quick schemes.
This is different.
I've been working on this since noon.
Ma, when are you gonna learn that these money-making gimmicks of yours never work?
I'm not the only one with dreams.
I remember when we thought catering was the ticket.
Do you remember that?
Girls, this time I think we have really hit the jackpot.
Oh, me too.
This wedding consulting business is the smartest thing we've ever done.
I'm a little nervous about tomorrow.
I've never cooked for 300 people.
Please, in Sicily, we did it all the time.
And we didn't have the modern conveniences you have today.
We had to slaughter our own meat, prepare our own seasonings, and, if the food wasn't perfect, after cappuccino, they shot the cook.
Ma, you're making that up.
No, I'm not.
Why do you think there are only two guys from Italy?
Oh, places everybody.
Hit it.
You know, this is boring.
I know how we could make the time go faster.
We could sing a work song, like they do on the railroad.
Just follow my lead.
Gonna stuff a chicken   Gonna stuff a chicken  Like my mama taught me   Like my mama taught me  Gonna take the chicken down to Mississippi  Rose.
Rose, just stuff it.
Who on earth could that be at 3:00 in the morning?
Maybe it's a Jehovah's Witness with a caffeine problem.
All right.
Maybe we should go see.
Yeah.
Maybe we should have a weapon.
Please, the three of you without make up is enough to scare anyone.
- Who is it?
-  It's Priscilla.
Priscilla?
Priscilla!
You're getting married tomorrow.
You should be in bed.
- There's not gonna be a wedding.
- The hell there isn't.
Sorry, dear, you were saying?
Ramone and I had a fight.
I decided I'm not gonna marry him.
Oh, honey, now that's ridiculous to call off your wedding because of a silly little argument.
- What did Ramone do?
- He slept with my best friend.
We're gonna eat chicken for the rest of our lives.
Oh, Priscilla, I'm so sorry.
Listen.
Be grateful he got it out of his system before the marriage.
It'll give you something to make him feel guilty about.
Most women go through three, four years of marriage for ammunition like that.
Hello, Miami Mom's Catering.
- It's Ramone.
- Tell him he's scum of the earth.
She says that you are the scum of the earth.
But she said it with a lot of love in her eyes.
- He says he's sorry.
- Do you hear that?
Darling, he's sorry.
So I guess that settles everything, okay?
We'll see you at your wedding.
Girls!
Wait a minute.
We're talking about the sacred institution of marriage here.
Are you willing to sacrifice the happiness of these two kids - for the almighty dollar?
-  Yes.
I just want to be sure we're in agreement.
Ramone, I'm gonna put Priscilla on now.
I just talk to him.
Hello?
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Okay.
Goodbye.
We're back together.
Sometimes when you really talk things out like that, you can solve anything.
I can't thank you ladies enough.
We're so much in love.
Ramone can't even wait until tomorrow.
- Oh, isn't that sweet.
- We're eloping to Las Vegas.
- You're what?
- He's booking the flight now.
- Congratulations, darling.
- Congratulations?
Listen, we were going to give you your wedding gift tomorrow, but since we won't see you, why don't you take it home tonight.
Thank you.
Good night.
Dorothy, are you crazy?
We're gonna lose a fortune on this wedding.
And you let her march out that door with your best piece of crystal.
Hello, police?
Yeah, I'd like to report a robbery.
But that wasn't a scheme, Sophia, that was a legitimate business.
And we lost our shirts.
That's the beauty of this water thing.
You can't lose.
It's a rip off, pure and simple.
That's why the French were first to come up with it.
Sophia, why are you so obsessed with money?
Because I wanna buy a TV for my bedroom.
Ma, we have a perfectly good TV set in the living room.
But you never let me watch what I like.
I wanna make sure I don't miss that final episode of MASH I've been hearing so much about.
Sophia, honey, that show hasn't been on in years.
Is Hotel still on?
Yes.
Hotel is still on and MASH isn't?
How gullible do you think I am?
Do I look like Donna Rice?
You know, Ma, I seem to remember another time you were trying to make extra money so you could buy a TV set.
Do you happen to be talking about Brooklyn, April 1954.
You remember that, but you don't know that MASH is off the air.
Shut up and stroll with me down memory lane.
I'd taken in some sewing.
It was a couple of weeks before Easter.
- I'm home.
- Call the New York Times.
What's for dinner?
Pierre is writing today's selections on the blackboard in the kitchen.
-  Ow, my tooth!
- Oh, yeah, I forgot.
Stay away from the food on the table, it's wax.
Hi, Ma.
Dorothy, I didn't know you were coming.
- Did you bring the kids?
- No, I wanted to talk to you alone.
- Sal, Dorothy's here.
-  Did she bring the kids?
Hi, Pop.
No, the kids are at home.
Hey, what the hell is this?
I thought dinner was in the oven.
- There's nothing but a tin plate.
- Take the foil off the top.
It's something new.
It's called a TV dinner.
The wax fruit looks better.
Ma, I need to ask you a favor.
I wanna get a part-time job and I was wondering if you could watch the kids two days a week.
Stan lost his job.
I told you that yutz is a deadbeat.
Stan did not lose his job.
His job, he could afford to lose.
A novelty salesman.
The novelty would be if he made a sale.
Don't listen to your mother.
There's a big market for novelties.
That plastic dog doo we snuck into Charlie's lunch pail, was a scream.
I'll bet his cocker spaniel will catch hell for that tonight.
Lucky me.
I'm married to the Noel Coward of Canarsie.
I just want to pick up a couple of extra dollars so we can buy a television set.
- No.
- What?
No, I won't watch the kids.
But you love it when the kids come over for a visit.
That's not the point.
Don't throw away money.
This TV thing is just a fad.
Hey, did you know this turkey comes with stuffing?
Ma, TV is not a fad.
Otherwise Swanson would have called those radio dinners.
I told you, no.
I didn't know these were mashed potatoes.
They don't have lumps like yours.
You want lumps, Salvadore, I'll give you lumps.
Ma, I cannot believe you are so old-fashioned in your thinking.
I said no and it's no.
I'm too busy to have this argument.
Fine.
I'll just leave the kids with Stan's mother.
Over my dead body.
That gorilla scares the children.
Michael didn't sleep for a week after he saw her last time.
Ma, that is enough.
One way or another, I am going to earn that money for the TV.
Sophia, would you just tell her so your husband can enjoy his meal in peace.
- Tell me what?
-  These peas taste like fresh.
But you can't mix them with the mashed potatoes.
They should have a tunnel running from the pea compartment to the mashed potato compartment.
Ma, what is Pop talking about?
What should you tell me?
All right, all right.
It's your tenth anniversary, your father and I decided to buy you a TV set as a gift.
- Ma, you can't afford that.
- That's why I'm doing alterations.
Think I need a wardrobe this size to go to Mulberry Street and squeeze a zucchini?
Oh, Ma.
What's so funny?
I lied.
I wanted the job so we could buy Pop a TV for his birthday.
Then it's settled.
You buy us one, we'll buy you one.
- It's a deal.
- Sure.
Then your father can watch the Friday night fights with your yutz of a husband, you come here and watch Person to Person with me, and maybe once a week the whole family can come over and watch that new show, Make Room for Daddy.
Thanks, Ma.
- Where are you going?
- Get some air.
- We got air in the house.
- I like beer with my air.
-  You wait up for me?
- Don't I always?
-  I love you.
- I love you, too.
I look at him, I see Errol Flynn.
- That pizza was delicious.
- The best.
There's still one piece left, who wants it?
- I do.
- I do.
Well, I can split it three ways.
What am I supposed to do, lick the box?
Ma, you don't like store bought pizza, you prefer homemade.
I also prefer milk straight from a cow.
I adapt.
This is awful.
Ma, if you weren't going to eat it, why did you take it?
It's the principle.
You're always leaving me out of things.
Now, Sophia, that's not true.
The hell it isn't.
What about that dance marathon you cut me out of?
Oh, now, come on, Ma.
That was different.
There was money at stake.
We didn't even tell each other about that.
I remember I was the first one to arrive, remember?
And I was wearing that blue sequined dress  Will you quit complaining, Marty?
It's gonna be fun.
You said we're going dancing tonight.
You failed to mention it was a dance marathon.
Well, the first prize is $1000 and I have to have that money.
I'm in desperate need of medical attention.
- Is it serious?
- Very.
If I can't afford a new fall wardrobe, I'll never land myself a doctor.
No offense, Marty.
You know, sometimes I don't think you're serious about me.
Don't be silly.
I love you as much as I could any dry cleaner.
Run and get us a number.
Go on.
Why, hello there, Blanche.
Well, Dorothy.
Russ, hi.
What are you all doing here?
Russell and I just entered the dance marathon.
- Really, so did I. - Yes.
It's for charity.
I thought it would be fun.
Well, have yourself a good time.
Try not to overdo it.
Blanche, what is that supposed to mean?
Oh, nothing.
Just that these things can be a little strenuous for a woman of your years.
Who am I, Minnie Eisenhower?
I can last just as long as you can.
Oh, Dorothy, please.
I think I do have a little more endurance than you.
Blanche, we are not dancing on our backs.
- You take that back.
- I will not.
You just implied that I'm an old lady.
Well, honey, I didn't mean to imply it.
I meant to say it flat out.
You know what your problem is?
You can't stand a little competition.
- Which is why you kept this a secret.
- I notice you're here too, Dorothy.
So you tried to keep it a secret from me.
Hi, girls.
Et tu, Judas?
No, it's me, Rose.
My hair is a little different.
You two found out about this thing too?
- Mm-hmm.
- That's right.
Let give you a little friendly advice.
You're wasting your time.
'Cause that thousand dollar prize is gonna be mine.
When I was younger, I was known as the dancing fool.
How old were you when they dropped the "dancing" part?
Yowza, yowza, yowza, ladies and gentlemen.
And welcome to the thirteenth annual Jefferson Hospital Heart Charity Dance Marathon.
Yes, sir.
One word of caution before we begin.
Contrary to what some folks thought last year, this marathon is not part of the Cardiac Rehabilitation program here at the hospital.
So, if any of you toe tappers have more than 30 percent blockage, we implore you to leave the dance floor at this time.
All right, now.
Let's let the dance marathon begin!
A one, two, three, four.
Blanche, you're not gonna believe this.
I twisted my ankle.
I can't dance.
No, no, no, you have to.
I can't believe you'd force me to dance all night in pain.
I mean, if you win, you said you were gonna take all the money.
- What do I get out of this evening?
- Come here.
Let's samba.
Ladies and gentlemen, our charity dance marathon is now entering its seventh hour.
Let's give our contestants a great big hand.
Hi, girls, how are you holding up?
- Oh, fine, just fine.
- Terrific.
You know, this reminds me of the big dance back in St. Olaf to kick off Pretzel Week.
My Uncle Gunther, after the great beer nut shortage of '21 Foul!
Send a judge over here.
This woman is trying to put us to sleep.
You're just exhausted and you're trying to blame it on me.
Exhausted?
I'll show you who's exhausted.
Maestro.
How about something with a little octane.
Okay, little lady.
All right, boys!
Take it away!
A one, two, a one, two, three, four.
Out of my way, amateurs.
Blanche, mind if I give it a try?
Oh, for heaven's sake, go on.
No, Dave, I better do this by myself.
You might get hurt.
Three, four   It looks like it's going to be a long night.
Ladies and gentlemen, a nice round of applause for our four remaining couples as we enter lucky hour number 13.
And a special round of applause for spunky Nick Montavesti.
He outran enemy fire at Iwo Jima, but phlebitis is the enemy he couldn't outrun tonight.
And now, it's time to tango.
- Blanche, I can't.
- No.
- I can't go on.
- No, you have to.
Just a little while longer and I'll have that thousand.
And you will have a wonderful story to tell your poker club.
No, I'm sorry, Blanche.
I quit.
- Don't you dare.
- No, I quit.
- No, I quit.
- Marty!
Uh-oh, ladies and gentlemen, it looks like couple 29 is out of the competition.
And that little lady on the dance floor is out too unless she can find a new partner within the next minute.
Oh, yeah?
Excuse me, sir.
Listen.
Would you consider dumping your partner and dancing with me Listen, sir.
Excuse me.
Would you consider it if I  Dorothy, Dorothy!
I got a charlie horse.
- I can't make it.
- Shake it off, wimp!
I can't.
Russell, come back.
Come back here.
Come back here!
Russell!
Looks like it's just you and me, Blanche.
Rose, I'm afraid I have to leave.
- Are you in pain?
- I will be if my wife catches me and she just walked in.
David!
David!
Ladies and gentlemen, it looks like we have a winner.
Couple number 29!
That's me.
I won.
I won!
I won!
I won!
Just a minute, it's not over yet.
It looks like we have another couple re-entering the floor.
I will never forget the look on your face when Dorothy and I tangoed on to the floor.
And I will never forget the look on your faces when you were disqualified and I won the thousand dollars.
And it was so sporting of you to share your winnings.
With my $10 I got that can opener I always wanted.
Don't say no, just hear me out.
- Do you think I'm cute?
- Oh, Ma.
- Just answer.
- Yes, Ma, I think you're cute.
Would you say cute verging on adorable?
Sophia, what's this all about?
Just picture my face on this jar filled with my tomato sauce.
We could put Paul Newman out of business.
Ma, if you had your choice of a spaghetti sauce with your picture on it or Paul Newman's picture on it, which would you choose?
Back to square one.

- Ma, what's the matter?
- Dorothy, thank God it's you.
I broke my glasses at the mall and I can't see a thing.
It took it took me six hours to find my way home.
Ma, if you couldn't see, why didn't you call me to come get you?
I tried to, but every time I put in a dime and dialed, a condom popped out.
I got five in my pocket.
Here, Dorothy.
A lifetime supply.
Dorothy, which one of these necklaces looks better with this dress?
This gold chain or the pearls?
They both look nice, Blanche.
I'm not sure about the pearls.
Do pearls nestled in the ample cleavage revealed by my low-cut gown somehow might suggest I'm nothing but a cheap, easy, good time?
They might.
That settles it.
Pearls it is.
Blanche, you look terrific.
You look like you lost 15 pounds.
Thank you, Sophia.
Oh, that's your thigh.
I thought it was part of the couch.
Blanche, try to remember, gravy isn't a beverage.
Blanche, Ma broke her glasses.
She can't see a thing.
-  Hi, Rose.
- Hi, Rose.
What's the matter, honey?
Something wrong?
Yes no.
Well, I guess yes and no.
Honey, what is it?
I found out this morning I'm gonna be a mother again.
We've been over this a hundred times.
You cannot get pregnant using the toilet at the mall.
I bet it's a boy.
You're carrying really high in the front.
I'm not having a baby.
I'm getting a baby.
I got a telegram that my Uncle Hingeblotter had passed away and left me custody of his baby.
Oh, my God.
What are you gonna do?
I'm not sure.
I've always dreamed of the chance to be a mother again, but it's a big responsibility.
Oh, it sure is.
I'm not sure I could raise another baby at my age, and I'm far younger than you.
And prettier.
Not that prettier has anything to do with it, but I just am.
You know, Rose, I have a confession to make.
I have always dreamed of the chance to raise another baby.
Well, Dorothy, if you're lucky, maybe someday one of your uncles will drop dead.
What I mean, Rose, is that if you decide to raise this child, I think I'd like to help you.
Really?
Wait a minute, if you both want to raise this child, why, I might even consider it myself.
But you said you didn't want to be a mother again.
But I meant by myself.
As long as you all are around to change its diapers and clean up when it spits up and pees, I'd love to be a mother again.
Are you girls sure you wanna do this?
Look, I know it's gonna be a lot of work, but oh, it'd be worth it to hear a baby's laugh around the house.
Oh, come on, let's do it.
What do you say, Ma?
What choice do I have?
If I say no, I'll be back at the home building log cabins out of popsicle sticks.
Then it's settled.
I'll call the lawyer and tell him to bring the baby.
Did he say if it's a boy or a girl?
He didn't say, but it must be one or the other.
You been watching PBS again, Rose?
Dorothy?
Dorothy, I'm going to my bedroom.
I want to lie down for a while.
Ma?
Dorothy, who the hell parked a Buick in my bedroom?
Sophia!
Rose, what are you doing in the bathroom?
Ma, this is the kitchen.
Oh, boy, if this is the kitchen, I'm poaching an egg in the toilet.
Dorothy, look at this old picture I found.
That's me at 15, standing next to my Uncle Hingeblotter.
Who's the other guy?
That's my uncle's half-brother: Inkeblotter.
Oh, girls, we have a big problem.
What is it, Blanche?
- Well, we're all women.
- No.
- Sure we are, Dorothy.
- Oh, shut up.
I'm reading the Spock book on baby care, and he says it's important for a child to have a male role model during its formative years.
- What are we gonna do?
- We'll wear Yankee caps and scratch our behinds after every beer.
Oh, Blanche, we don't have anything to worry about.
If we give that baby love and attention and understanding, it'll turn out fine.
That's beautiful.
Besides, what does Spock know about raising babies?
On Vulcan, all the kids are born in pods.
Rose, I know this is a long shot, but, did you take much acid during the '60s?
- Is, uh, Rose Nylund here?
- I'm Rose Nylund.
Well, I'm Chester T. McRainey, legal counsel to your late Uncle Hingeblotter.
Oh, we've been waiting for you.
Did you bring the baby?
- I brought him.
- Him, did you hear that, girls?
Does he look anything like me?
Uh, well judge for yourself.
Come on, Baby.
Come on, Baby.
Well, uh, maybe just a little around the eyes.
What in hell is going on here?
This is Baby.
Five-time blue ribbon winner at the Minnesota State Fair.
This sweet little thing was your uncle's pride and joy.
Oh, my God.
That's the cutest baby I've ever seen.
Ma, it's a pig!
You were no great looker when I brought you home from the hospital.
I loved you anyway.
Well, he sure is cute.
Come here, Baby.
Oh, I haven't had a pig as a pet since I was a little girl.
Just forget that.
I want that filthy beast out of my house now.
Fine, your cousin Gunther will be happy to take Baby, as well as the $100,000 that comes along with him.
I beg your pardon?
Uncle Hingeblotter was a very rich man.
And he loved this pig dearly.
That's why he left you $100,000 to make sure Baby would be well taken care of.
Well, I'd take care of him for free.
Oh, shut up, Rose.
How long does Rose have to take care of this pig before she gets the money?
Well, as long as he lives.
Oh, forget it.
I'd split the money with you girls.
Forget it.
- How long does a pig live?
- 25 years.
Forget it.
How old is this pig?
Welcome, Baby!
Hi, Dorothy.
Hi, Ma.
Dorothy, how do you make your voice do that?
Here, honey, I picked up your new glasses.
Oh, thank God.
Now I can see.
Wait a minute.
These are no good.
- The wrong prescription?
- No, the wrong frames.
I specifically asked for old lady smoky green.
These are black.
I look like Buddy Holly.
There you are.
You get in the kitchen and eat your slop before I spank that little pink fanny.
All right, I'm going.
I'm going.
Oh, sorry, that's the way they used to call us for dinner at the home.
Go on, Baby, go on.
Go on.
Rose, I thought we decided that that pig was gonna stay in the pen out back.
He didn't like it there.
It was too confining.
Oh, but Baby's a free spirit.
A wanderer.
A rebel.
You know, in a lot of ways he reminds me of Jimmy Dean.
The actor or the sausage?
You know, Dorothy, I was thinking, how wonderful it is to have a pig living here.
This morning I was all snugly warm under the covers and I opened my eyes and there was Baby, fast asleep at the foot of the bed, like a sweet angel.
That is sweet.
Rose, how long do you think it'll be before the pig is dead?
- Did Baby do something wrong?
- No, no.
Not unless you count that when he burps, it smells like four burning tires.
Girls, I'm just so mad.
That pig tore up my nightgown last night.
The people you date are from foreign countries.
They play by different rules.
Oh, I'm talking about Baby.
I never should've let that barnyard beast in my house in the first place.
He ruins my clothes, smells up the whole house, and he likes to watch me take a shower.
He's a pig.
There's no accounting for taste.
I didn't realize Baby was such an inconvenience.
I'm sorry.
I'll call my relatives and see if somebody can take him off my hands.
Him, and the $100,000.
Remember, Blanche, the pig is gonna drop any day.
Rose.
Come back here, honey.
I guess maybe I was a little bit too hasty.
Baby isn't really that much trouble.
Heck, this is an old nightgown, and, well, he is kind of cute.
He's not the first pig to watch you shower, and that's my last pig joke, I swear it.
Then it's all right?
He can stay?
Well, of course he can, honey.
That's great.
I'll go tell him the good news.
I won't be able to get off work tomorrow.
Can somebody else give Baby his lunch?
- Don't look at me.
I won't do it.
- Why not?
What you two are doing is making me sick.
Degrading yourself by living with a filthy animal.
And for what?
Money.
It's humiliating.
I don't want any part of it.
- What if we cut you in?
- What time does he eat?
Girls, girls!
Come quick, Baby just collapsed.
Now I know how Johnny Carson feels.
Baby.
Poor Baby.
This morning he was so full of life, and now he looks just terrible.
Rose, honey, don't torture yourself.
Now, Baby is very, very old.
Whenever one of God's creatures outlives its normal life expectancy, why, it can go any minute.
Would you mind not looking at me when you say that?
Does anybody know where the thermometer is?
Sure, in the medicine cabinet.
Why?
I wanna take Baby's temperature.
Although, I'm not sure what the normal temperature is for a pig.
I know a ham turns out nicely at 325.
Ohhhh.
I'm sorry, Rose, I don't know what I'm talking about.
I'm delirious with grief.
So, what are you gonna do with your share of the money?
Oh, come on, Blanche, the pig isn't dead.
He's sick.
The money never even crossed my mind.
Then what were you doing with these EF Hutton brochures?
Ma, you took those out of my purse.
No, no, they fell out when I was taking out a 20.
I'm sure not putting my money into stocks and bonds.
Hey, this is found money.
This is fun money.
This is hot beaches and sweaty men money.
Getting naked and rolling around on the ground money.
Even your money has more fun than I do.
Boy, it's great being rich.
I can't believe we spent so much money that we don't have yet.
Relax.
When I looked in on Baby this morning, he was a half hour away from Sizzilean.
Oh!
Well, Rose Nylund, shame on you.
With a gentleman caller in the middle of the afternoon.
He's not a gentleman caller.
He's a veterinarian, here to see Baby.
- Oh.
- Oh.
Uh, how is Baby, doc?
I read in Newsweek they ran him out of Haiti.
How is Baby?
Not very well, I'm afraid.
I don't think he has much time left.
- Oh, that's too bad.
- Tragic.
- Terrible.
- But there's hope!
What?
There's really nothing wrong with Baby, physically.
He has a mental problem.
Four grown women decide to live with a pig, and he's the one with the mental problem?
Well, I wouldn't exactly call it a mental problem.
When you take an animal out of its natural environment, it's not uncommon for it to have a hard time adjusting to new surroundings.
Are you trying to tell us that that pig is dying of homesickness?
In a way, yes.
My recommendation is to get him back to the farm.
Once he's home, he should do a lot better.
- Thank you very much.
-  Thank you.
Oh, I guess we have no choice.
I'll call my relatives in Minnesota and make arrangements to send Baby to the farm.
No!
I'm just as disappointed as you are!
Oh, it's been great having a pig living in the house.
But we can't jeopardize Baby's health, the doctor said so.
Please, what does he know?
He's not a real doctor.
He makes his living sticking thermometers up a cat's behind.
Well, I don't know, he seemed pretty sure.
Honey, doctors make mistakes, too.
I still think we ought to send Baby home.
Rose, do you realize how far away home is?
Baby is sick.
Why, the plane trip alone could kill him.
Even if he did get home safely, who knows what kind of care he'd get?
Nobody loves that pig as much as you do.
As much as we all do.
If you all think it's best, I guess he should stay.
Oh, thank you for caring so much.
I want you to know that poor, sick, helpless pig in there appreciates what you're doing, too.
I'm gonna look in on Baby.
You're the best friends I've ever had in my life.
I feel terrible.
I feel miserable.
Let's go shopping.
Hi, Dorothy.
Oh, Blanche, Blanche.
I am so glad you came back.
- Listen, I have to talk to you.
- I have to talk to you, too.
And it's about the money.
That's exactly what I wanted to talk to you about.
I have been so worried.
The way we've been spending this money is wrong.
Blanche, I could not agree with you more.
Honey, I've been up half the night worrying about how foolish we've been, spending all that money on silly little things that we don't need.
I am so relieved.
Oh, I just knew you would agree that combining our money to buy one big thing was the best idea.
I just hope you like it in light blue.
Like what in light blue?
-  - We'll be right out, Sophia.
- Blanche, that's a Mercedes.
- I know it.
Don't you just love it?
It's ours.
Blanche, you don't understand.
I wanted to give up the money and send Baby home.
No, you can't do that.
We lied to Rose.
We tricked her into jeopardizing the life of an animal, just to make a fast buck.
We have to tell her the truth.
I cannot let you do this.
Get out of my way.
I want that car.
I will give you anything.
We have to tell Rose the truth.
I'll give you one of my sons.
I have given this a lot of thought.
I have had four kids, I have never had a Mercedes.
What do you say?
Which one do you want?
Biff, Doug, Skippy?
No, don't take Skippy, he's got asthma.
Blanche, this has gone far enough.
Rose?
Honey, I want to talk to you.
Now don't bother Rose.
She's busy.
Oh, it's okay.
I was just thumbing through the old family album.
Here's a picture of Baby when he was younger.
Wasn't he an impressive sight?
Oh, yes, Rose.
But then again, who isn't when he's caught relieving himself and eating dinner at the same time?
Well, I think Baby looks a whole lot better today.
A pig isn't supposed to be green, Blanche.
Oh!
Rose, I have a confession to make.
When I said I thought Baby shouldn't go back to the farm, I wasn't thinking of him.
I was thinking of myself.
I was acting out of greed.
I wanted the money.
Dorothy, I am shocked!
Oh, so am I!
I can't believe you lied to me.
Well, now don't be too hard on her, Rose.
She may have been doing it for the wrong reason, at least the decision was right because Baby is better off here.
Why ya'll looking at me like I'm a murderer?
This pig is dying because he's old and sick.
I refuse to even entertain the notion that he's slipping away because he's homesick for this godforsaken place.
-  - What's going on?
He recognizes the picture of Uncle Hingeblotter's farm.
Oh, my God!
He is homesick.
I'm a murderer.
I'm nothing but no-good money-grubbing trash.
Baby, forgive me.
Blanche, get a hold of yourself.
Rose, I apologize.
Rose, so do I. Oh, Rose, can you ever forgive us?
Rose.
- I don't know.
- Oh, honey, please.
We're really sorry.
Well, I might forgive you, but I can't speak for Baby.
Is there something we can do to smooth things over?
Well A kiss on the nose might be a nice gesture.
Oh, I never can stay mad at you silly gooses.
What's going on?
Oh, Ma, Baby's going home.
May he rest in peace.
Ma, Baby isn't dead.
We've decided to send him back to the farm and give up the money.
Wait a minute.
Let me get this straight.
We lived with a filthy pig in our house, bought a bunch of stuff on credit we can't afford, and now we're gonna kiss off 100,000 bucks because the pig is homesick?
That's right.
Sometimes life really bites the big one.
Hi, Sophia.
I see you finally got your new glasses.
Yeah, I also got these to beg for spare change on the corner.
That is enough!
Now look, we have to stop this moping around.
So we don't have the money anymore.
I mean, we still have a great deal to be thankful for.
We live in a lovely home, we have our health and each other.
I'll tell you the truth.
When we had the money, we did crazy, ridiculous things.
To be honest, I'm glad it's gone.
Girls, my cousin who took Baby just sent us a letter.
Please let there be cash in it!
I can't stand being poor another day.
Oh, I'm sorry.
"Dear Rose.
Just wanted to let you know Baby arrived safely.
He was really happy to be back on the farm.
His last 36 hours on this good earth were" What?
What?
Baby died.
Poor Baby.
Poor Baby!
Well, I guess he wasn't homesick after all.
Just old.
And for this I fought my way back from a stroke?
I cannot believe this.
If he had stayed here another lousy day and a half, we'd be rich!
What was that?
Oh, no!
Oh, they've come to tow away our Mercedes.
Oh, now I am really depressed.
I never even got a chance to ride in it.
Boy, what a great idea.
-  Isn't it luxurious?
-  And the engine's so quiet.
There's Alice Feinbaum.
Look at her, green with envy.
Eat your heart out, Feinbaum!

It's your cab, honey.
Have a wonderful time at the wedding.
Be sure to give Phil and the family my love.
Before I go, I need your opinion on something.
What should I give Phil's daughter as a wedding gift?
Your grandmother's lace tablecloth, or 50 bucks towards getting a neck?
Give her the tablecloth.
You're right.
She's got a husband.
He doesn't care that she looks like Abe Vigoda, why should I?
See you in a couple of weeks, pussycat.
So, what with our busy careers and full social lives, we felt we really needed a full-time housekeeper.
- What do you think of our home?
- Lovely.
Last place I was had bars in the windows and a big wall with guard dogs.
- Sounds like quite a security system.
- The best.
San Quentin.
Fifteen years I spent in that stinking hole.
I saw violence, I saw despair, I saw Johnny Cash eight times.
Well, I guess that concludes the interview, - unless there are any questions.
- I have a question.
Does Johnny Cash ever wear plaid?
It's not her fault.
She's from Minnesota.
We'll be in touch.
Oh, girls, we have interviewed dozens of people, we haven't met one likely candidate.
Maybe our standards are too high.
- May I help you?
-  Yes.
Does the mean-looking white woman I just passed live here?
- No.
- Oh.
Then I come to apply for the housekeeping position.
- Please, please, come right in.
- Thank you.
- I'm Marguerite Brown.
- I'm Dorothy.
These are my roommates, Blanche, Rose.
- Please, sit down.
- Well, thank you.
Well, why don't you begin by telling us a little about yourself.
Well, there isn't much to tell.
I'm hardworking and honest, and I'll work for a reasonable wage.
That's it?
All right, I won't go on with this charade any longer.
There is something else.
I'm black.
Now, if that's a problem for you, I'm white.
Now, of course, that'll cost you extra.
Oh, Marguerite, I could kiss you.
And I don't go for that freaky stuff.
Neither do Dorothy and I.  Excuse me.
Hello?
Hello, Norman, darling.
Are we still on for tonight?
But you said we But you promised I see.
All right.
Bye-Bye.
I don't understand.
That's the second time Norman has canceled.
Maybe he's not interested.
Not interested?
Don't be silly.
I am the most attractive and available woman in all of Miami, now that Miss Donna Rice has moved to Hollywood.
I don't mean to pry, but maybe I know a way to get Norman's attention.
If it involves silk sheets and a parochial school outfit, I've already tried it.
Here, take this.
It's worked for my grandmother, it's worked for my mother.
Dab a little behind your ears and whomever you desire will come to you.
- What is it?
- It's a gift.
Keep it.
Marguerite, there's no need to bribe me.
As far as I'm concerned you have the job.
- Fine with me.
- Me, too.
- Can you start tomorrow?
- I'll be here bright early.
- We'll see you then.
- All right.
Be sure and use that just like I told you now.
- Yes, ma'am.
Bye.
-  Bye.
Ooh, what an absolutely charming woman.
- I wonder what this is.
- I'll bet it's a love potion.
Ah, Rose, come on, honey.
There's no such thing as a love potion.
Sure there is, Dorothy.
My grandparents got together because of a love potion.
Well, actually it was a foot salve Gramps accidentally swallowed.
You see, Grandma was the nurse who pumped his stomach, but she was new and she attached the nozzle to the wrong place.
Next thing you know, they were engaged.
I don't care what's in this.
It's worth a try.
I'll do anything to get Norman's attention.
If you get Norman's attention, it won't be because of what is in that bottle.
But if it does, I'll sell my mother for an ounce.
Girls.
Girls, look what I found under my bed.
Gee, that's the most colorful dust ball I've ever seen.
- This is no dust ball, Rose.
- What do you think it is?
It's a rock.
I think it may be some kind of charm.
It is.
I learned it from my grandmother.
You see, you put a specially-painted rock beneath a person's bed to bring them a restful sleep.
Are you saying that you put this under my bed?
But I was only trying to be helpful.
I figured with those terrible bags, you needed the rest.
Dorothy always looks like that.
Besides, it would take a lot more than rest to get rid of those babies.
Why don't you all take turns hitting me with a two-by-four?
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to cause any trouble.
I think Marguerite's been inhaling a little too much Pine-Sol.
Wait a minute.
Weren't you just saying this morning how much better you're sleeping lately?
That's right, you said you hadn't slept so well in years.
It has nothing to do with this rock.
Look, I like Marguerite as much as you do, but she's been here a week and she is not doing a very good job.
I think she's doing a terrific job.
Why, ever since she gave me that potion, Norman's been on me like white on rice.
I'm talking about White on rice?
All right, maybe she's lax on the housework.
She is more than a little lax.
She's habitually late, she's broken a number of glasses and she threw out People Magazine before I could read it.
Look at all the wonderful things that have happened since Marguerite started working here.
Blanche is dating Norman, you're sleeping better than you have in years and Sandy Duncan is finally back on TV.
I think we should have a little talk with her.
You know Sandy Duncan?
Look, Marguerite didn't throw out People.
Oh, good.
- Morning, Rose.
- Hi, Dorothy.
Why are you cleaning the kitchen?
This is Marguerite's job.
I know exactly what you're going to say, but I talked to Marguerite on the phone and she has a good excuse for being late.
Fine, what is it?
She had to go pluck a hair from the chin of a dwarf.
And you fell for that old excuse.
Has either of you girls seen Marguerite?
- She's not here yet.
- I wished you'd look at this.
She melted my buttons with the iron.
Now I'll never be able to open my blouse again.
It's a dark day in the history of mankind.
Maybe we'd better have another talk with Marguerite.
Look, I think we've had enough talks.
It's time we did something about this.
Oh, Dorothy, you don't think we ought to fire her.
Look, Marguerite is a lovely person.
She just cannot do the job.
I hate to admit it, but you're right.
We had a similar situation back in St. Olaf, with Mrs. Gunderson, our grade school teacher.
Oh, she was the nicest woman you'd ever want to meet, but as the years went by, she got her facts a little confused.
In biology class she started telling kids While we were studying WWI, she told us mustard gas was something you got from eating too many hot dogs.
That's why to this day in St. Olaf, everyone celebrates the 4th of July with a thin omelet on a bun.
What do you say after we fire Marguerite, we each chip in and get Rose a CAT scan.
Rose, is there a point to your story?
Well, of course there's a point to it.
Mrs. Gunderson was a really sweet woman but she just couldn't do the job anymore.
Then it's settled.
We fire Marguerite.
Couldn't we wait just a few more days?
I think Norman's going to invite me to the premiere of Give 'em Hell, Harry!
Starring Mr. Father Mulcahy from MASH.
What does that have to do with Marguerite?
It was her potion that brought us together.
Blanche, you still think that Marguerite has some kind of mystical powers?
Oh, well, all right.
I guess I'm just being silly.
Okay, go ahead and fire her, Dorothy.
Why should I be the one to fire her?
You're the meanest.
Blanche, that's not true.
Dorothy just looks the meanest.
We hired Marguerite together, we fire her together.
Thank you, Rose.
And by the way, you look the dumbest.
Morning, everyone.
Oh, Marguerite, I feel so terrible.
- What's the matter with her?
- She's a little upset.
She just found out Gene Shalit wants his hair to look that way.
I'm sorry I'm late, but I had to go downtown to get some special herbs.
I'm throwing together another little aphrodisiac for Blanche.
I better get to my work.
Girls, we can't fire her now, she's making me an aphrodisiac!
Use vodka and black underwear like everyone else!
Can we just get this over before I lose my nerve?
Oh!
I hate to interrupt your work, but we have to talk to you.
I just want you to know that Tootie is my favorite on The Facts of Life.
You're firing me, aren't you?
Marguerite, we think very highly of you as a person, but we're going to have to let you go.
We we just don't feel you're right for this job.
But you certainly did when you hired me.
Marguerite, you're fired!
Rose, we just did that part, honey.
Sorry.
I'm not very good at this sort of thing.
Of course, we'll pay you for the rest of the week.
Oh, Marguerite, I hope you understand.
I've never been fired from any job.
We're really awfully sorry.
Well, you should be, because I think you're making a very big mistake.
- She seemed pretty upset.
- We just fired her.
What do you think she meant, "we're making a big mistake"?
She meant that she's unhappy that she lost her job.
Or that she's going to blow up our kitchen.
Oh!
Nice hit, Tracy.
Now, why don't you throw one into the Schiller's yard?
This has been the worst day of my life.
Honey, what happened to you?
First, my alarm didn't go off so I was late to work.
Then I had a flat tire on the way.
When I finally got there, I smashed my hand in the door.
Oh, I feel like crawling under the covers and eating Velveeta right out of the box.
I hear B.B. King does that when he's tired of singing the blues.
Honey, why don't you sit down.
I'll give you some lemonade.
Thanks, Dorothy.
Something weird is going on around here, Dorothy.
Don't be silly.
You're just having a little bad luck.
Do you really think that's all it is?
Of course.
Well, maybe you're right.
- Need any help?
- Get away from me, you jinx.
I mean I mean, no thank you, Rose.
Girls, you'll never guess what happened.
Norman threw me over for a fat woman.
- Oh, Blanche, I'm sorry.
- Thank you, Rose, but Dorothy ought to be sorry, it's all her fault.
- What?
What did I do?
- You made us fire Marguerite.
- Now she's put a curse on us.
- Come on now.
You're just upset.
You're talking nonsense.
It makes perfect sense to me.
I rest my case.
Come on, you have to admit terrible things have been happening since we fired Marguerite.
Our plumbing went bad, the refrigerator broke down.
We've all had car trouble.
You haven't slept a wink, and now Blanche's boyfriend's dumped her for a porker.
Marguerite said we were making a big mistake when we fired her - and she was right.
- I am not listening to this.
You better listen, 'cause we're in big trouble here.
Now, what are we gonna do?
I think we should get Marguerite to take off the curse.
Maybe we should ask her if she wants her job back.
That's a great idea.
I'm gonna call her now.
Wait, wait a minute.
Nobody is calling anybody.
Now, look, this whole thing has gotten way out of hand.
First of all there is no such thing as a curse.
No!
All right, we've had a little bad luck, but, ladies, that's life.
I mean, when you look at it, has anything that out of the ordinary really happened?
This isn't the Orange Bowl, is it?
Gee, I hope Marguerite likes champagne.
Don't you think we may be going a little overboard with this?
Dorothy, remember the crow man.
Do we have any caviar to go with this champagne?
Oh, that must be Oh, girls, I'm scared.
Now, now, just take a deep breath and relax.
There's nothing to be scared of.
-  - Okay, Dorothy, get the door.
Go on.
Oh, Marguerite, how lovely to see you again.
Please come in.
- Hello, ladies.
- Welcome back, Marguerite.
Why don't you sit down and make yourself comfortable.
I must say I was a little bit surprised when you called me to give me back my job.
That's why I wanted to explain There's nothing to explain.
It was all a silly mistake.
- Champagne.
- Uh, thank you.
- Ladies - These are for you.
Ladies, this is all very nice, but, please, there's something I must say.
You see, when you fired me Oh, now, we don't have to go into that.
Here, a little gift from us to you.
Oh, uh  Well Well, isn't that nice?
A tiara?
Well, you said to get something I'd buy for myself.
You see, I've always wanted a tiara.
Ever since I was a little girl back in St. Olaf.
Every year I'd blow out my birthday candles and wish for one.
And every year I'd get a freshly-carved pair of wooden shoes.
Except for one year, during the Depression when I just got a block of coal, which I carved into a pair of high-top Keds.
You can do anything you want to her, just don't hurt us.
Here, Marguerite.
Let me put this on for you.
Oh, my!
You look stunning.
Doesn't she just look stunning?
Sophia!
What are you doing here?
I live here, remember?
What is this, the Miss Black America contest?
Marguerite, I'd like you to meet my mother.
This is my mother, Sophia Petrillo.
Ma, this is Marguerite.
Oh, I'm pleased to meet you.
Won't you join us?
Yeah, and pour me some of that champagne.
I never know if I'm gonna make it to New Year's.
So, what are we celebrating?
Did The Supremes get back together?
Ma, you know, I really think you should go and lie down.
You look exhausted.
Hey, I'm 80.
I look like this in the middle of a dead sleep.
- So, what's your claim to fame?
- I'm the housekeeper.
Yeah?
You always wear a tiara to clean the toilet?
Ma, could I see you in the kitchen?
Hey, take it easy!
I'm not Gumby!
What's going on?
Ma, I want you to be especially nice to Marguerite.
Please, Dorothy, I wasn't brought up in a cave.
Actually, I was brought up in a cave.
Listen, Ma, I am serious.
You are not to ask her to lift a finger.
And if there's anything you need, you let me or one of the girls know.
Let me get this straight.
- She's the housekeeper, right?
- Right.
- She's not to lift a finger?
- Right.
Anything needs to be done, you take care of it?
Right.
Where are you going, Ma?
To get a job as a housekeeper.
Ma, Ma, be serious now.
Marguerite is dangerous.
She put a curse on us.
And I'm the one that got put in a home?
I know it's unbelievable but we fired her, she put a curse on us, so we had to hire her back.
Now, if we can just keep her happy, maybe she'll leave us alone.
You really are afraid of her?
Ma, Ma, it's unbelievable but please go along with it, okay?
I mean, do it for me.
If it means that much to you, pussycat, you got it.
Oh, thanks.
Now, remember, not a word.
So, what's all this crap about you putting a curse on my daughter?
- Sophia.
- We'll be turned into kumquats.
- What is she talking about?
- Don't play dumb with me.
I've been known to cast a curse myself.
Do you think Shelley Long was really tired of playing in Cheers?
Wrong, baby.
I was tired of her.
Is that what this is all about?
You think I put a curse on you?
It's true, you got mad at us for firing you.
That's why you reversed that love potion you gave me.
Honey, that wasn't love potion.
That was Chanel No.
5.
I'm not buying that.
Dorothy uses Chanel No.
5 all the time and she never attracts men.
What about this painted rock that you put under my bed?
Oh, thank God you found it!
This is very special to me.
It was the first wage I ever earned.
Ma, they paid you in rocks?
Hey, don't knock it.
To this day in some parts of Sardinia, two of these will get you a veal and pepper sandwich.
Then you lied to me about it's helping me to sleep.
Okay, I figured that you'd be angry because I didn't sweep under the bed.
Gee, you're really a good liar.
I know, that's why I'm studying to be a lawyer.
See, I'm going to school at night and the only time I have to study is when you all go out in the morning.
That's why the toilets don't get the attention they probably deserve.
Then everything was just a misunderstanding and Norman really did dump me for a fat woman.
No kidding?
Fatter than you?
I hate to burst your bubble but I just wanted a job.
The truth is I don't have any magical powers.
Boy, have I been stupid.
I haven't felt this dumb since I found out William Conrad wasn't one guy in a jacket and another guy in a pair of pants.
Well, Marguerite, I guess we just let our superstitions get the best of us and I think we owe you an apology.
No, no, I owe you an apology.
You're right, I'm a lousy housekeeper.
I feel like such a silly goose.
Goodbye, ladies.
And I'm really sorry for all the trouble, but thank you for being understanding.
And thank you for taking care of that Shelley Long.
I'm tired of that thin, uppity white woman, too.
Well, that's that.
Anything else you need me to straighten out for you?
No, Ma.
So, tell me, how was the wedding?
Beautiful.
Until the bride lifted her veil.
I shudder to think what was under that dress.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Thank you for being a friend  Traveled down the road and back again  Your heart is true  You're a pal and a confidant  And if you threw a party  Invited everyone you knew  You would see  The biggest gift would be from me  And the card attached would say  Thank you for being a friend  Hi, Ma.
- What are you making?
- History.
You finally perfected your non-rolling meatball?
Just because you have a chin doesn't mean you're Jay Leno.
Ooh, what smells so good in here?
Besides me?
Lasagna ala Sophia.
I made it for the Daughters of Italy cooking contest.
All right, all right.
You twisted my arm.
- It's good.
- It's delicious.
It's garbage.
No, what are you talking about?
You can't fool me.
I watched your faces.
- Neither one of you got the look.
- What look?
The look that every cook knows and dreams about.
The look of total instant pleasure.
Your father put that look on my face once.
That's nice, Ma.
Nice?
I said once.
We were married 52 years.
- The mail's here.
- Rose, what's wrong?
Oh, nothing.
It's just a letter I got.
- It's bad news.
- Oh, that's eerie.
I had the same feeling.
My Aunt Gretchen in Fort Lauderdale died.
- Oh, Rose.
- Honey, I'm sorry.
Were you close to Aunt Gretchen?
No, I couldn't stand her.
Wait a minute, Rose.
Honey, if you didn't like your aunt, why are you so upset?
Because I have to speak at her funeral.
I'm terrified of speaking in front of people.
It's my biggest fear in the world.
Why can't somebody else speak?
Generptionloken.
It's a family tradition.
It means the oldest niece has to give the eulogy.
Well, not literally.
Literally, it's a herring poacher you can wear as a sun visor.
The family got together and they decided that was close enough.
Rose, I take it that no member of your family was ever a returning champion on Jeopardy.
Anyway, that's why I have to speak.
How I've dreaded this day coming.
I just can't do it!
Rose, calm down.
Honey, now listen.
I know an easy way to get through this.
The way to relax when you have to speak in front of a group is to imagine what they all look like naked.
- Really?
-  Yep.
And if you do it right, you'll probably even start to laugh.
Hi, Ma.
Hey, what is that smell?
The sweet smell of success.
It's my new entry in the cooking contest.
Veal parmesan, my luckiest dish.
It saved my marriage once.
Ma, you gonna tell a story?
Please, does Heifetz rosin a bow?
This is a tearjerker.
Picture this.
New York City, 1931.
The Depression.
Your father and I are newlyweds.
One rainy night, we have our first fight.
He says he's leaving, I say fine.
He goes out the door, I start to cook.
A few hours later, he comes back.
He says he couldn't find a cab.
We eat in silence.
Halfway through, I look up.
He's got tears in his eyes.
He tells me, "This meal is like our marriage".
The veal is like him, tough and stubborn.
The tomato sauce is like me, hot and spicy.
And the mozzarella is like our love: It stretches but it never breaks.
Ma, that's lovely, but I don't see what luck had to do with it.
You were conceived that night, Dorothy.
Ma What's lucky is your father never knew or he never would have eaten my veal again.
Oh, honey, now you'll just do fine.
No, I won't.
I remember the last time I tried to give a speech.
I was in high school.
You wanna hear about it?
Would you follow us if we tried to make a run for it?
Yes.
It was my high school graduation.
- I was valedictorian.
- You were valedictorian?
Yes.
I was fourth out of 19 graduating seniors.
- Anyway -  Wait a minute.
Rose, if you were fourth, how were you chosen valedictorian?
The same way every high school chooses the valedictorian.
We drew straws.
And you picked the biggest one.
I don't like to brag Anyway, the topic of my speech was "There's a big world out there but you have to change buses in Tyler's Landing to see it".
Graduation day came and everybody was there.
The mayor was there, his wife, old Johannson, young Johannson, big and little Gustav, the Stringmeyer twins, fat Jerry Will you get to the point, Rose?
The point is I choked.
Roped out, froze on the spot.
Since then, I've never been able to speak in front of a crowd.
I say next time, we try and outrun her.
Listen.
You're not the only one who's gone through this.
I had a phobia too.
You, Dorothy?
You were afraid of something?
Big, old, strong, strapping thing like you?
Who am I, Joe Frasier?
I had a fear of flying, Rose.
And my sister, Gloria, got married in California.
Course I had to go.
So I got myself some therapy.
And it worked.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
Everybody is afraid of something.
What are you afraid of, Blanche?
Nothing.
You're a real team player, aren't you, Blanche?
I'm not afraid of anything now.
But I sure used to be.
Not a phobia, exactly, but something just as bad.
A recurring dream.
Night after night, I had this awful dream that I was trapped in an enclosed space full of men.
Now what could that mean?
- Let's give this a second.
- Now, wait a minute.
There's more to it.
All the men were bald.
Just me and a bunch of bald men.
Oh, and I kept hearing the voice of God.
Anyway, one day I just finally said to myself: "Blanche, you are bigger than this.
You don't have to succumb to any dream.
Unless it involves meeting Mel Gibson at an oyster bar".
And just like that it stopped.
Mind over matter, you can do the same thing, Rose.
- I don't know.
-  Oh, come on.
Of course you can.
Think positively.
That's right.
Listen, why don't you go to your room now and start working on your speech and in a while you can try it out in front of me and Dorothy, okay?
- Okay.
- Yes, go on.
Go on!
Go on.
I'm gonna tell you something.
I'm sure glad I am not in her shoes.
Oh, I'd hate to have to give a eulogy.
What if it was my eulogy?
- What?
- What if you were giving a eulogy for me?
What would you say?
- Oh, come on, Blanche.
- I'm serious, Dorothy.
What would you say?
Well, I I guess I'd say that you were a lovely generous person.
And, you know, one of the best friends I ever had.
Nothing about my looks.
Well, I'd say that you were one of the prettiest friends - "One of'?
- "The," Blanche.
The prettiest.
What would you say about me?
- Dorothy, come on.
- I told you, you can tell me.
All right.
Well, I would say I always felt safe having you in the house.
And I would say I always enjoyed talking to you when I'd come home from one of my numerous dates.
And I would say I always looked up to you like an older sister.
Thank you, Blanche.
Oh, and I forgot one thing.
I would also say you're fat.
I'm ready to practice my eulogy.
Blanche, if you'll stand by the barbecue.
- That's where Aunt Lib will be.
- Where should I be?
Right there.
That's where Uncle Gunther will be.
Oh, and it would help if you'd hum.
Is that part of the Viking funeral?
No, Uncle Gunther just hums a lot.
If he has something important to say he spells it out in salt.
Unless he's quoting a song by the Four Tops.
- Then he spells it out -  In pepper.
Rose, can we just get on with the speech?
Okay.
Um Friends, family, Aunt Gretchen was a special person.
She She What's the point?
I can't do it.
- Of course you can, Rose.
- You were doing just fine.
That's because you were here.
Tomorrow, I'll be out there all alone, staring at my relatives, who'll be ready to hoot and snicker at the first crack in my voice.
They'll think I'm an idiot.
Please, it's family.
They know you're an idiot.
There's only one way I'm gonna get through this.
If you two will come with me to the funeral for support.
Oh, will you do it?
Please, Blanche.
Please, Dorothy.
- Please, Blanche.
- I will if Dorothy will.
Please!
If you really think it'll help, Rose, of course we'll do it.
Oh, thank you.
You are the best friends I've ever had.
Before I lose the nerve, I better make the plane reservations.
Did she say "plane reservations"?
I thought her aunt lived in Fort Lauderdale.
She did, big mouth.
But she's being buried in the Bahamas where she spent her winters.
Damn.
I don't have one thing in black that isn't see-through.
Boy, Dorothy, it's good you got over your fear of flying.
-  Oh, right.
- The way you used to carry on.
- Oh.
- Remember when we went to your Uncle Michael's wedding in Arizona?
Before we boarded the plane, you threw yourself on the ground, kicking and screaming.
- It was a little embarrassing.
- I'll say.
You were 48.
Well, it's all behind me now.
I tell you, I really feel very comfortable on planes.
Good, you'll probably have to take a dinky little plane to the Bahamas.
They flutter, they shimmy, they wobble You got a lot of guts, Dorothy.
- I'm proud of you.
- Oh, thanks, Ma.
Please don't let them take me!
What are you reading?
I'm checking the weather in the Bahamas.
It's gonna be in the upper 80's with a nice gentle breeze.
So with that outdoor service, we'll come away with healthy color.
Aunt Gretchen always loved the sun.
Well, maybe they'll have an open casket.
Girls, I have some bad news.
I am not gonna be able to go with you.
- Why not?
- It's Ma.
She's sick.
I'm gonna have to take her to the hospital.
- Oh, no.
- Wait a minute.
She left for that cooking contest about ten minutes ago.
She called.
She had a bad cannoli when she got there.
Right now, she's doubled over with cramps, crying out with pain, and making the most spectacular comeback since Dennis Hopper.
Are you all right, Sophia?
Of course I'm all right.
Halfway to the contest I realized I forgot the wine.
- For your mussels marinara?
- No, for me.
I always drink wine during cooking contests and my sister Sam.
Dorothy, Sophia's not sick.
She didn't eat a bad cannoli.
Whoever called and said that was just making the whole thing up.
Rose, Dorothy made the whole thing up.
She doesn't want to go with us.
- But you promised you'd go.
- I know, that's what I said.
All I can say now is tough!
I'm not getting on that plane and you can't make me.
Well, then I'm not going either.
Oh, I don't believe my ears.
Girls!
The entire purpose of this trip is to conquer our fears.
Why, if we back out now, that'd mean our fears have conquered us.
I will not allow that.
We're gonna march out that door right now, like the strong confidant women I know we are.
Chins up, chests out, buttocks tight.
I know "buttocks tight" has nothing to do with it, it just looks good.
Buttocks tight, I said.
Buttocks tight!
Oh, forget it.
I'm so proud of you.
You're just doing beautifully.
Nobody would dream you have a fear of flying.
Unless they happen to glance at the bruises on my forearm.
You think you could hold on to something else for a while?
Oh, of course, honey, I'm sorry.
Oh!
- I meant like the arm rest.
- Oh.
Look, girls.
I found this bolt in the aisle.
Where do you think it goes?
With me, off this plane.
- What was that?
- Them shutting the door.
They shut the door?
Afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
My name is Candy.
I'll be your flight hostess.
Please review the information cards in your seat pockets for the safety information in the unlikely event - of a mishap during our flight.
- Mishap?
What does she mean - What does she mean by mishap?
- Like, bad movies or cold food or running out of ice.
- Running out of gas - Oh, my God.
- God.
- Will you just calm down?
- Drink champagne.
- I don't like champagne.
- Go ahead, it might relax you.
- Oh.
Didn't make me relaxed.
Just makes me wanna burp.
We burp and the pressure in the cabin will change and we'll fly into a mountain.
That would be a good example of a mishap.
Rose, do me a favor, fasten your seat belt.
Over your mouth!
Why don't we use our time constructively and work on your eulogy.
What are you planning to say?
I don't know.
I'll probably start out talking about Aunt Gretchen, the person.
She was always a very rigid person.
Especially now.
I'm sorry, Rose.
I guess that maybe that champagne did relax me.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, girls, oh, my God, look!
What, Blanche, what?
Look, all the men on this plane are bald!
It's all right, Blanche.
The captain just turned off the "no bald men" sign.
I am talking about my recurring dream.
Remember?
I'm trapped in an enclosed space full of bald men.
Well, I didn't tell you the rest of it.
All those bald men and I are on a plane and we fly into the ocean.
Oh, come on now, Blanche.
You're behaving just as crazy as we are.
- It's just a coincidence.
-  Ladies and gentlemen, be sure your seat belts are securely fastened in preparation for the take off.
And if anyone found a big bolt, please return it to me.
It came off the beverage cart.
Yes, that's it.
The beverage cart.
Dorothy, it is not a coincidence.
It is my nightmare and it's coming true.
Don't be silly, Blanche.
Not all of it's coming true.
- You haven't heard the voice of God.
- That's right, Blanche.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Captain Lord.
I hope you enjoy your flight.
- Dorothy - We made a rule.
No talking, it shakes the plane.
I just had to say one thing.
If Blanche is right, and we are gonna die this afternoon, - I'm glad we're together.
- Yes, that's very comforting.
Now, shut up.
I know what you mean, Rose.
We have had some very special times together.
Like the time there was that hurricane and all the power went out for two days and we huddled together to keep warm and sang campfire songs - and told stories.
- Oh, yeah.
And Rose admitted that Charlie was the only man she ever slept with.
And you admitted Stan was the only man you ever slept with.
And I admitted my shoe size was really five and a half.
I wish we had more time together.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute, what are we doing?
The flight has been perfectly smooth.
There hasn't been a hint of turbulence.
This is Captain Lord.
Looks like we're running right into the IT of a tropical storm.
I'm a dead woman.
Unfortunately, that means we're going to turn around and return to Miami.
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.
Did you hear that, girls?
We're saved.
- What do you mean?
- That part wasn't in my dream.
The dream's broken.
We're going back to Miami.
- We're gonna be all right.
- Not me.
Well, you two faced your fears.
Dorothy got on the plane, you faced your dream, I didn't give my speech.
Give it now.
Yeah.
Yes.
Go on.
Now, you wrote it, you give it.
Go on, you can do it.
Uh everyone?
I was supposed to speak at a funeral this afternoon, and now I can't, but I'd still like to give my speech, if no one minds.
I wrote some things down but I'd just rather talk.
Uh, the funeral was for my Aunt Gretchen.
I didn't know her well.
The only thing I remembered about her is she used to scare me.
Jumping out of my closet at night, putting false fangs in her mouth, sometimes baying at the moon.
Now her dying scares me.
But there's a good part to being scared.
You get to know who your friends are.
They're the ones who help you not be scared.
Maybe that's what Aunt Gretchen was trying to do all along.
Help me not be scared.
I think so.
Goodbye, Aunt Gretchen.
Take a seat, lady.
This isn't the Copacabana.
- Rose, that was beautiful.
- It was, it truly was.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Captain Lord again.
If you all look out the left side of our aircraft, it'll tip over.
Sorry, just a little small airplane pilot humor.
Hi, Ma.
What the hell are you doing home?
Ma, let's not get all mushy.
You chickened out, didn't you?
No, we went, or at least we started to.
Halfway there we ran into a tropical storm so we had to turn around and come back.
And the plane was entirely full of bald men.
They were all former Mr. Cleans on their way to a reunion in the Bahamas.
So, tell us about the cooking contest.
The competition was fierce.
It came down to my mussels marinara, and Louise Pallito's chicken cacciatore.
Louise Pallito?
Isn't she the one who brags about being Al Capone's piano teacher?
True.
103 years old.
Anyway, the judges voted.
It was a flat-footed tie.
That's when it went into sudden death.
And?
I just told you, it was sudden death.
Louise couldn't take it.
She keeled over.
Kaput!
The funeral is on Saturday.
- Sophia, that's terrible.
- You think that's bad?
Guess who I volunteered to give the eulogy?
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Thank you for being a friend  Traveled down the road and back again  Your heart is true  You're a pal and a confidant  And if you threw a party  Invited everyone you knew  You would see  The biggest gift would be from me  And the card attached would say  Thank you for being a friend   - Hi, Ma.
- Give me your watch.
Sure.
What do you want it for?
I'm working on a magic act for the talent show at the center.
Abracadabra, one, two, three.
Ma.
Relax.
Dorothy, was your card the ace of spades?
Ma, what the hell are you talking about?
I think I got chapter seven and nine mixed up.
Oh.
This watch is broken.
Ma, Stan gave me that watch when we got married!
The marriage never worked, why should the watch?
I've got bigger problems.
I don't have an act for the talent show.
Talent show?
Can I be in it?
Blanche, what you're talented at isn't generally done on a stage.
This isn't downtown Saigon.
Ma, will you do me a favor and forget about the talent show?
You're just gonna end up with egg on your face like last year.
What did you do last year, Sophia?
What are you, deaf?
She just told you.
I tried to juggle eggs.
- Hi, Rose.
- Hi.
What's the matter, honey.
Is something wrong?
I'm concerned about nuclear war.
And just yesterday, her biggest concern was whether Bubbles the chimp was traveling with Michael Jackson against his will.
Okay, honey, tell us what's wrong.
What does this picture look like to you?
Uh, me sitting on a throne dressed as Cleopatra, watching while two naked men wrestle to see who gets to make love to me.
It's the end of the world.
Only for the loser.
Okay, Rose, what is this all about?
You know that Sunshine Cadet troop I've been helping out with?
This was done by one of the girls.
She calls it "Nuclear Bomb, The Day After".
Eight years old and this is on her mind.
- That's unbelievable.
- She wasn't the only one.
Three other girls did pictures just like it.
- I don't understand it.
- Oh, honey, it's not so uncommon.
I mean, kids hear about nuclear war on TV.
They read it in the papers.
It's part of their lives.
They can't help but think about it.
Oh, it's so sad.
When I was eight years old I was just worried about the usual childhood things.
How much would the tooth fairy leave me?
What would I get from Santa?
Would I ever be chosen small curd cottage cheese queen.
I'm only doing this because I have some more coffee left to drink.
Small curd cottage cheese queen?
It's our town's biggest honor, right after  Large curd cottage cheese queen.
The point I'm trying to make is kids should enjoy being kids.
They should be looking forward to their future, not worrying about the end of the world.
Hey, what's with the long faces?
We were just talking about the bomb.
Very nice.
You haven't even seen my new act.
Ma, we were not talking about you.
Everybody's gonna be talking about me when they see what I cooked up for the talent show.
I call my new act "Sophia and Sophia".
Get a load of this.
Uh, hi, Sophia.
Oh, hello, Sophia.
How are you feeling today?
I've got a little arthritis in my neck.
I was wondering why my wrist was hurting.
What do you think?
Come on, Ma, you could see your lips moving.
So?
Well, a ventriloquist's lips aren't supposed to move, Sophia.
Is that common knowledge?
I'm afraid so, Ma.
Otherwise it would just be you talking with a sock on your hand.
Tough break, Sophia.
One minute you're about to entertain the masses, the next you're back on a foot covering a corn pad.
Now you know how Valerie Harper feels.
Well, it's my turn to cook dinner.
What does everybody want?
Nothing for me, thanks.
I'm not hungry.
Don't let this get to you.
It's something you can't do anything about.
I've always believed you can fix a problem, no matter how big it is, if you just put your mind to it.
How are you gonna fix nuclear war, write a letter to President Reagan?
That would be pretty stupid, wouldn't it, Blanche?
Reagan's only responsible for half the problem.
I'll have to write to Gorbachev, too.
Rose, honey, you can't be serious.
Dorothy, I'm taking my troop on a camp out in two weeks.
I don't want this nuclear nonsense spoiling our fun.
A well written, thoughtful, intelligent letter to Reagan and Gorbachev might just do the trick.
Anybody know how many Z's there are in "czar"?
Oh I don't know why I bothered to make this.
Rose could've sat on my hand.
To this day the ghost of the headless Indian roams the forest crying out, "Where is my head?
Where is my head"?
If the Indian doesn't have a head, how can he cry out?
Maybe he talks out of his behind like Cadet Master Rose.
Well, the Indian cries out from his heart.
That's the worst kind of cry.
My father's a surgeon.
That's physiologically impossible.
How can we be drawn into the story if you're misrepresenting the facts.
Honey, it's a make-believe, scary camp out story.
Ooh, real scary.
You want scared, kid?
You keep it up.
My mother's a lawyer.
Threaten me again and I'll own your house.
Your father's a doctor, your mother's a lawyer.
What are you, one of the Cosby kids?
- This is boring.
I want to watch MTV.
-  Yeah!
You can't watch television, we're on a camp out.
No we're not.
We're in your living room.
The camp out was called off, remember?
The rain doesn't have to spoil our fun.
There's nothing we can do outside that we can't do right here.
You promised us we could pee in the woods.
Get away from that couch.
I have an idea.
Who's in the mood for some real camp out food?
I have beans, I have beef jerky, marshmallows We want pizza.
Yeah, with artichoke hearts and shitake mushrooms.
Yeah.
Girls, would you be terribly disappointed if I took the troop down the block for some pizza?
No!
All right, in an orderly fashion head for the station wagon.
That's not the way to get your good behavior badges.
Come on, now, you all know you use both fingers for the sunshine salute!
I'm so glad those little heathens finally left.
Me, too.
I am exhausted.
I don't think I'd have the energy to raise more children.
Although I am still in my childbearing years.
Sure, Blanche, you and Emma Jean Cocoa.
Oh, my God, they're back.
Now I know how the family in Poltergeist felt.
Does Rose Nylund live here?
I'm sorry, you missed her.
She left with her cadet troop.
Can we help you?
I am Alexi Bovanov from the Russian embassy.
Premier Gorbachev read Rose's letter and would like to meet with her.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry It's Coca Cola, no?
No need to apologize.
In Moscow I stand in line six hours for half as much.
Would you please make sure Rose receives this note?
Wait, you can't be serious.
Why would the premier of Russia want to see Rose?
He was quite moved by her letter.
He wishes to extend an invitation to her and her family to visit Moscow and discuss nuclear disarmament and world peace.
We'll be in touch.
Thank you.
Oh, this has to be some kind of joke.
No, it isn't.
Look at this.
This is an official document to Rose from the premier of Russia.
But why would he want to meet the same woman who once said, "If the city of Atlantis is lost, how can Bobby Vinton appear there twice a year"?
Rose, the most unbelievable thing has happened.
Remember that letter you wrote to Gorbachev?
- He's answered it.
He wants to see you!
- What did Reagan say?
Well, nothing.
He didn't send a letter.
Well, that is unbelievable.
I wrote him two days earlier.
I did the dumbest thing.
I walked out of this house and completely forgot it's a full moon.
Under those conditions a Sunshine Cadet Master must wear full headdress.
Here I come, girls!
Kemosabe, I think the world is in heap big trouble.
We interrupt this dream for a special news report.
Good evening, I'm Edwin Newman.
The eyes of the entire world were on Moscow today as Rose Nylund continued her mission of peace.
It was 15 days ago that Mrs. Nylund wrote the now historic letter that captured the attention of Premier Gorbachev.
Today she was in Red Square capturing the hearts and minds of the Russian people.
We switch now to Moscow.
Rose.
Rose.
Rose.
Thank you.
I want you to know Dr. Zhivago is my favorite movie of all time.
Now I'd like to introduce my friends.
No, no, no.
This is Dorothy.
You have a very beautiful country and I have enjoyed my stay here.
When it comes down to it, your lives aren't really that different than ours.
Except for your toilet paper.
No wonder you people always look so grouchy.
And this is my friend Blanche.
Hello, you all.
I have had such a great time here that I would like to express my appreciation to Premier Gorbachev on this special day.
Happy birthday to you  Happy birthday to you  Happy birthday Mr. Number One Communist  Happy birthday to you   Ma, what are you doing here?
Thanks a lot for leaving me home.
Lucky I found this nice German kid who flew me to Red Square.
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
I know you're dying to hear my act, so I'll get right to it.
I just flew in from Miami and boy, I've got to tell you, your Moscow was one clean town.
No litter on the streets and all the bugs are in the American Embassy.
Thank you, Sophia.
And thank you all.
Remember, give peace a chance.
The Moscow audience is the best audience in the world.
The best audience in the world.
The best audience in the world.
The best audience in the world.
- The best audience in the - Rose.
Hi, Dorothy.
Hi, Blanche.
Are you all right, honey?
Oh, I'm fine.
I just had a dream.
We were all in Moscow.
It was snowing and we were all wearing fake furs.
I guess I'm just nervous about that press conference tomorrow.
I've never had a press conference before.
The idea of all those reporters coming to the house to ask me questions scares me to death.
Honey, relax.
Reporters are just people.
They put on their pants one leg at a time.
Except for that sports writer Steve Maxwell.
He likes to jump into both legs all at once, with a little hop step.
Rose, honey, there is nothing to be nervous about.
Honey, the press wants to meet you because Gorbachev really respects your views on world peace.
Boy, when you say it out loud it really sort of lays there.
Pay attention.
You're in for a treat.
Oh, Ma, not another act.
No, Dorothy, not just another act, the act.
I've taken a classic and reworked it Sophia-style.
Thanks for the Medicare  For Blue Cross and Blue Shield  For a hip that finally healed  Remember on prescriptions Generic is a steal  We thank you so much  What do you think?
Don't hold back.
I can take the criticism.
Depressing.
Awful.
Stinky.
Go to hell, all of you!
Actually, she took it better than I had expected.
Dorothy, I've been talking to that good-looking reporter.
He just got back from Russia.
He told me some very interesting things.
It snows there in the summertime and they don't have very many attractive women.
Do you realize what that means?
When we go to Russia, I will have my pick of any man in the country and you can make a snowman in June.
We can start the press conference now.
Where is Rose?
She left to pick up her cadet troop.
That's adorable.
She wants to share this moment with friends her own age.
You must very proud of your daughter.
- My daughter?
- Friends her own age?
Why, how old do you think Rose is?
Well, based upon her letter, we figure nine or ten.
To be perfectly honest, she's closer to ten.
Blanche, could I see you in the kitchen for a moment?
Was there anything we could get you?
Coffee, tea, pair of Levi's?
Well that solves the mystery.
They think Rose is a little kid.
What are we going to do?
If she reads that letter to the press she'll humiliate herself.
We can't tell those Russians the truth.
Why not?
Because they will use it as a propaganda ploy to convince the whole world that all Americans are as dumb as Rose.
That would rock the very foundation of our government, undermine our great leaders and potentially topple our entire democracy.
Rocky IV had a profound effect on you, didn't it?
Oh, come on, we have to tell them the truth.
Hi, girls.
I hope I'm not late.
Uh, Rose, listen, we have something to tell you.
This is amazing, this is so amazing.
To think I'm giving a press conference and next week we all go to Moscow.
Can you believe it, Dorothy?
No, but then again, I can't believe that God wanted Jerry Falwell to go down that water slide in a cheap suit.
Rose I'm babbling, but it's because I'm so excited.
Maybe I should open up with a joke.
No, my jokes are boring.
Maybe I should just tell a story.
Like the time my Uncle Gustav got drunk and tried to milk a porcupine.
- Rose, we have to tell you something.
- There has been a misunderstanding.
Rose, we just found out today that everybody thinks the letter you sent to Gorbachev was written by a nine-year-old girl.
You can't be serious.
Ah, the troop is back.
Which one is little Rose?
This one!
This is little Rose right here.
I will inform the press we are about to begin.
This is so embarrassing.
Don't worry.
We'll let Linda read your letter.
- No one will be wiser.
Come on.
- Is it all right, Mrs. Nylund?
Gee, I don't know.
I guess so.
Good.
I was afraid I wouldn't get my moon beam badge because you said a Sunshine Cadet never lies.
Ladies and gentlemen, several weeks ago I brought a letter to the attention of our premier.
He was so moved by it's child-like simplicity, he requested to meet with the little girl who wrote it.
I would like to introduce you to that extraordinary nine-year-old girl, Rose Nylund.
Uh - I'm Rose Nylund.
- Oh, boy.
I'm the one who wrote the letter.
Oh, boy.
I guess there's been some kind of misunderstanding, but a Sunshine Cadet never lies.
I have two announcements.
This press conference is canceled, and I am proud to be the newest citizen of Miami.
If anyone wants to reach me, my name is Dave.
Honey, that took a lot of courage.
- You all right?
- No!
This is the worst day of my life.
Oh, come on, honey.
It's not that bad.
I made a total fool of myself in front of the press.
I'm the laughingstock of the entire country.
What am I going to tell my mother?
Your mother's from St. Olaf.
She'll understand.
I'm just stupid.
I'm a dimwitted, dumb, simpleminded, grade-A, Minnesota chucklehead.
But, the important thing is you're our chucklehead, and we wouldn't trade you in for any other chucklehead in the whole wide world.
Why don't you take it, Dorothy.
Listen to me.
What you did was great.
It was historic.
Honey, your words managed to move the heart of a major world leader.
I would like to hear those words, too.
You promised us you would read us that letter.
I never will.
It's too embarrassing.
You said today was the worst day of your life.
What have you got to lose?
I'll never read this letter.
Never.
All right, then will you let me read it?
Oh, fine, kick me while I'm down.
I might as well get used to it.
"Dear Mr. Gorbachev.
My name is Rose Nylund.
I'm writing to you because I'm worried about nuclear war.
I hear there are enough bombs to blow up the world 100 times and it scares me.
It scares the girls in my cadet troop, too.
They talk about what they want to be if they grow up, not when they grow up.
That's why I'm asking you to please unplug your bombs.
I'll bet my bottom dollar, or in your case, your bottom ruble, that if you called President Reagan, he'd do the same thing.
It's just someone has to be first.
Thank you.
Your friend, Rose Nylund.
P.S.  Don't call the president in the afternoon.
That's when he takes naps".
Honey, that was really beautiful.
It's a shame that more people don't think like nine year olds.
-  Oh.
-  Hello?
Yes, she is.
Rose, for you.
Hello?
Yes.
It's the president!
Yes, Mr. President.
Thank you.
Goodbye.
The president loved my letter!
I've got to write this down in my diary right now.
I just figured out what I'm gonna do for the talent contest.
- What, Sophia?
- What?
My Reagan impression.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
thank you for being a friend  traveled down the road and back again  Your heart is true  You're a pal and a confidant  And if you threw a party  Invited everyone you knew  You would see  the biggest gift would be from me  And the card attached would say  thank you for being a friend  Finally finally I'd like to thank our hostesses tonight: Dorothy, - Rose and Blanche.
With people like them to support me, I am proud just to be running for city councilman.
So good night, and remember my slogan: "Gil Kessler for city councilman".
- You call that a slogan?
- Excuse us.
Easy on the arm, Dorothy.
You break it, you pay for it.
Ma.
Ma, you promised you'd stay in your room until the meeting was over.
Who am I, Alf?
- I was hungry.
- You were spying.
- So what?
He's a wimp, Dorothy.
- Oh, Ma.
For your information, Gil Kessler is a very bright man, an honest and devoted civic leader.
And probably the biggest wimp I've ever known in my life.
There's something else I don't like about him.
- What?
- I don't know.
It's a hunch.
I can't put my finger on it.
But if I could, I would have to wash it.
Ma, do me one favor.
Stay here until we're finished.
I can't believe you think your own mother would embarrass you.
It's not that, Ma.
It's that, Ma.
Well, I'd better skedaddle.
You know, my wife is out of town.
I'm going to be up half the night trying to pick out a tie-sock-hankie combo.
This is just the behind-the-scenes excitement I was hoping to be part of.
- Good night.
- Good night, Gil.
Bye-bye.
I think we ought to be proud.
We threw one heck of a party.
Didn't you guys just love being involved in politics?
Oh, I haven't had this much fun since I worked on the Dewey campaign.
Rose, you worked for Thomas Dewey?
No, Melville Dewey.
The founder of the Dewey Decimal System.
You know, Gil Kessler doesn't stand a chance of winning.
- Who says?
- The Miami Post, the Miami Journal, the Miami tribune, and Miami's own, Sophia Petrillo.
Ma, he's way behind in the polls, but the election is two days away and a lot can happen.
I, for one, am gonna do everything in my power - to get Gil elected.
- Fine.
You can start by taking this folder he left to his house.
On the other hand, why should I deprive Rose of a chance to be of service.
All right, but you'll have to wash these dishes.
Honey, those dishes are dirty.
Okay, I'll deliver the folder.
I guess there's no sacrifice too great for a cause you really believe in.
I just hope that big stupid jerk reimburses me for gas and mileage.
There goes a great American.
I woke you up, didn't I?
And I better have a good reason.
Well, I do.
I got a great idea for Gil's campaign.
I'm making bird feeders with his name on them to send around.
And you think that's a dumb idea.
You feel like taking this bird feeder away from me.
And smashing it with this hammer.
Like this.
Holy smoke.
Holy Toledo.
Holy mackerel.
- What, Ma?
- Nothing.
What is it, Sophia?
What, Rose?
What?
They caught Gil Kessler having an affair.
Oh, you're kidding.
With whom?
They don't know her name.
But look.
They hid in the bushes and took this picture of her from behind going into his house.
I don't believe it Wait a minute, that looks like Blanche's red dress.
And those look like Blanche's red shoes.
And aren't they her diamond earrings and gold bracelet?
That little floozy stole Blanche's clothes.
It's like having Agatha Christie right here in our kitchen.
Rose, Blanche is that little floozy.
- You You mean - She's at the 50.
you think she - The 40.
The 30.
Blanche, it's you!
You're getting so good at that, Rose.
Now who's that over there?
No, I mean right here.
Oh, my God.
My backside is spread all across the front page.
How could they do that?
They probably used a wide-angle lens.
If I'd known I was being photographed, I would've turned around and smiled.
Listen, Blanche, ruining a man's career for a one night stand is hardly something to make light of.
Oh, now, wait a minute.
You girls don't believe this.
I'm not denying that's me in the photograph, but I am denying that anything happened.
I just dropped off his folder.
Then why does it say here that you were in his house for two hours?
We were just talking.
Then why does it say, "The explosion was so great, it shattered windows in the building next door".
Rose, that's an article about an earthquake in Guatemala.
Girls, I dropped off the folder, talked for two hours, helped him pick out his tie-sock-hankie combo, and came home.
Now, nothing else happened.
I swear.
Okay?
- Okay.
- Okay.
Now, how are we gonna help him get out of this mess?
I ought to call the newspaper.
No, wait, wait.
I think you should let Gil handle it himself.
Oh, the paper says he's having a press conference this afternoon.
I don't think you should do anything until then.
Okay.
Fine, I'll wait.
Look at this picture of Kessler, Dorothy.
There's a secret behind those eyes.
Trust my hunch on this one.
Oh, come on, Ma.
Remember your hunch about your nephew, Angelo?
- You said one day he'd be Pope.
- Dorothy, you gotta pay attention.
I said one day, he'd sell dope.
What do you think he went to Attica for, the volleyball program?
Bruno Bonofiglio.
Ma!
I was asleep!
So was I. That's when it came to me.
Picture this.
Sicily, 1922.
The village is in a terrible wine crisis.
It's the peak of the wine season.
All our grape stompers are ravaged by an outbreak of athlete's foot.
Soon the Chianti has a green hue and tastes like Desenex.
They call in Sicily's foremost podiatrist, Bruno Bonofiglio.
He's the one who prescribed arch supports for Mussolini.
Must have really helped his lower back when they hung him by his heels.
Forget him.
I'm talking about Bruno Bonofiglio.
I take one look at him, and I have a hunch he's trouble.
But nobody believes me.
So, what happens?
He cures everybody and wine sales skyrocket.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Ma.
Unless I'm missing something, your hunch was wrong.
My hunches are never wrong.
Now, everyone is living high on the hog and eating rich foods.
The next thing you know, there's a gout epidemic.
Nobody can stomp grapes.
And Bruno makes a killing selling orthopedic sandals.
Don't tell me.
He went to America, and changed his name to Dr. Scholl.
No.
Actually, he developed a foot fetish and suffocated when he shoved his head in a lady's rubber boot.
Ma, don't ever wake me up again.
Quick.
Turn on the television.
Gil's press conference is about to start.
Gosh, I'm nervous.
I hope they're not too hard on him.
I wouldn't be too sure.
Look at all those reporters.
Yeah, there's Charlie Thompson.
And Fred Leone, and Mike Devlin.
Does he plan to withdraw from the race?
I had lunch at the press club once.
Only once?
Gosh, it took me two years to learn everybody's name on Eight is Enough.
Hush, hush, he's about to start.
Well, we're about to find out.
Here comes the candidate and his campaign manager now.
Good afternoon.
I'm here to respond to the media speculation that I am having an affair with an unidentified woman.
I have been the subject of many scurrilous, slanderous and downright malicious rumors in my career.
But this rumor is the worst kind of rumor.
This is a true rumor.
It actually happened Just like you said.
Well, not with me, it didn't.
Mr. Kessler, who was the woman?
I can't reveal her identity under any circumstances.
Independent sources identified her as Blanche Devereaux.
Oh, please.
What sources?
Sorry, Blanche.
I don't believe this.
He just lied.
Dorothy, he Rose?
Well, don't you girls believe me?
Sophia?
I believe you, Blanche.
Absolutely.
Hello?
I need a number for People magazine.
The department that buys stories about politicians who sleep with sleazy broads.
Don't worry, it's not about you.
Dorothy, Rose?
Talk to me.
You girls have got to believe me.
We believed you once, Blanche.
We're not falling for it again.
Falling for what?
I told you the truth.
Come off it.
You really expect us to believe that Gil was lying on television in front of a million people?
People lie on television, Dorothy.
They do it on 60 Minutes all the time.
He's a married man running for election.
Why would he say he had an affair if he hadn't?
I'm sure I don't know.
And I also don't know why you just assume I'm guilty.
Can you give me one good reason why I would lie to you?
You're embarrassed because you seduced him.
You're scared and guilty because you've ruined his campaign.
Three good reasons.
- Oh, shut up, Rose.
- Oh, shut up, Rose.
Hello.
Yes, this is Blanche Devereaux.
Yes, that Blanche Devereaux.
And no, I did not.
Absolutely not.
I will tell it to a judge, I will yell it from the highest mountain, I will swear to it on a stack of Bibles.
Now, did that sound like a liar?
No.
It sounded like Jim and Tammy Faye on Nightline.
Hello?
Yes, this is Blanche, and how did you get this number?
Better yet, why am I even talking to you?
I don't like you.
Matter of fact, I hate you.
You can just tear up my number and go climb back under your slimy rock with all the rest of your slimy friends.
And don't you ever call here again.
Dorothy, call Stan.
Blanche, why don't you admit what you did.
You made a mistake.
You live your life a certain way and now you're paying for it.
You are assuming that I'm guilty because of my past.
Well, that is not fair.
Listen, girls, I'm in trouble here.
Now, this isn't funny anymore.
You're right.
This is not funny.
It is sad.
You couldn't come to us and tell us the truth.
And you still can't.
Don't do this to me.
You're my two best friends.
How do we know you're telling the truth about that?
Well, I guess you don't.
Excuse me, Miss.
You can't go in there.
Oh, the hell I can't.
I ought to kick your butt to Tallahassee.
- I'm sorry, Blanche.
- You're sor Do you have reporters badgering you?
Do you have roommates calling you a liar?
You are the damn liar.
I wouldn't sleep with you if you were the last man in Creation.
Now, why did you lie?
- Well, the reason is - Why?
I was trying - Why?
Nobody ever listens to me.
Quit whining, you wimp, and tell me why you lied.
That is the reason.
Nobody ever listens to me.
They never have.
I'm a wimp, just like you said.
At least I was until today.
When the newspaper printed that story about my having an affair, people stopped thinking I was a wimp and started listening.
I couldn't tell them it was a mistake.
Are you trying to tell me that people like you better now because they think you went to bed with a gorgeous woman?
Here, see for yourself.
This is today's poll.
Blanche, I never expected that they would figure out it was you in that picture.
I felt terrible when they did.
Well, how do you think I feel?
People think I slept with you.
Blanche all my life, people have looked right past me.
You know, when I was growing up, the first day back at school every year, half the other kids always thought I was new in town.
I had to bring in a yearbook to prove that they were wrong.
But all the same, I always felt that deep inside me was a great man trying to get out.
So I went into politics.
And people kept looking right past that great man.
Until today.
Blanche, as crazy as it sounds, I've got a real chance to win.
Because you lied.
Is that such a high price?
Oh, Gil, I don't know much about politics, but I do know a thing or two about men.
And I know what kind of man you are.
You're an honest man.
That's why we all believed in you.
Now you started lying and you're just like other politicians.
Dishonest.
If you even win this election, it won't mean a hill of beans.
'Cause it won't be you winning.
You'll never be a great man, without being an honest man.
You think about that.
This is exciting.
Just think, in less than 24 hours, Gil Kessler could be city councilman.
I'd love to get excited, Rose, but no matter what happens, I'm gonna get stuck cleaning out that peeing-angel punch bowl.
Dorothy, I've been chatting with your boy, Kessler.
Give me another hour, I'll have his secret figured out.
What secret?
You got cheese in your ears?
I said give me another hour.
Get away from me, you bloodhounds.
I have nothing to say to you.
Except this: From now on, when my name appears in print, it better read Blanche Devereaux, comma, 39.
Well, she has a lot of nerve showing up here tonight.
Let's try to be polite, Rose.
Okay.
Hi, Blanche.
Blanche, I said hello.
I don't normally speak to people who call me a liar.
Now look, Blanche, we're in public now.
There's no reason to be hostile.
Oh, yes, there is.
I don't like you.
And horizontal stripes make you look like Roger Ebert.
Do you really want to put this on a level of name calling?
- Yes.
- So do I. - Traitor.
Back stabber.
- Tramp.
Home wrecker.
Indian giver.
I'm sorry, I just got caught up in the moment.
Ladies and gentlemen.
If I could have your attention, I have a few words I'd like to say.
First off, I want to thank all of you.
This has been a great campaign.
Tomorrow at this time, I could actually be your councilman.
But I don't want to be your city councilman unless I can win this job honestly, and there is something that I have not been honest about.
Blanche Devereaux and I never had an affair.
I only said that to improve my image.
Ha, ha, ha.
Blanche is too good a person to be used that way.
In fact, she made me realize how important honesty is.
That's why I'm going to be honest about something else.
I'm not who you think I am.
In 1968, I had an operation.
Until that time, I lived life as part-time stenographer and mild-mannered housewife, Anna-Maria Bonnaduci.
What?
I can't believe it.
What do you say about my hunches now, Dorothy?
Five more minutes, I would have had it.
Ma, how could you know?
No one knew.
Please, look at his nose, of course he's Italian.
I'm still confused about the operation Gil Kessler had.
Is the man asleep during it?
I think so, Rose.
And what about the parts they put on?
Do they test them first?
Of course, Rose, you know, like windshield wipers.
- So they work.
- I assume so, yes.
What are they made of?
Silly putty, Rose.
I don't know.
I don't know, Rose.
I just want to forget the whole incident.
It's been a terrible night and I am very upset.
Because Gil dropped out of the election and Blanche hates us.
I'm upset because they haven't re-run the Facts of Life Goes to Australia.
I wouldn't be surprised if Blanche never speaks to us again.
She'd certainly have every reason not to.
We did a terrible thing, not believing her.
We might as well get used to the fact that she's gonna be mad at us for a long, long time.
Hi, girls.
How ya'll doing?
Why, Blanche, aren't you mad?
Not anymore.
But we did a terrible thing.
You should stay mad at us for a long, long time.
You should make us grovel, eat dirt, beg for forgiveness, give us the silent treatment.
Rose, if you give us the silent treatment, I will eat dirt.
I couldn't stay mad at you girls, you know?
I did some thinking and I realized I was as much to blame for all this as you all were.
- How?
- By talking so much.
As you know, I've always talked a lot about my men.
And sometimes I've stretched the truth just a little.
It's an old Southern tradition, storytelling.
Just because you didn't have a good time there's no reason to bore your friends with a dull story.
So you embellish it, you add a little shading, a little color, a little hot tub.
I guess it finally caught up with me.
But I do think I've learned my lesson.
Can we have a hug and forget this ever happened?
You bet we can.
Come here, you two.
Oh, I'm glad we're friends again.
Oh, me too.
Listen, Blanche, now that we have you telling the truth, um Would you tell us the truth about, um, Bob Fredericks.
True, absolutely true.
How about Howard Asher?
True.
Eric Murdock.
True, true.
He had a twin brother.
Would I lie to my two best friends?
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidant And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see The biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say Thank you for being a friend  Hi, Blanche.
What's the matter?
You know that attorney I've been dating?
I caught him handling melons at the A&P.
And I take it they weren't yours?
You missed my point, Dorothy.
He told me he was a lawyer.
Turns out he's a fruit waxer.
Why do men have to put up false pretenses?
This from a woman who wears more padding on her chest than Johnny Bench.
Good morning.
I can't take time for breakfast, I'm late.
Rose, aren't you forgetting something?
Oh.
Sorry, Mama.
Rose, it's me Dorothy.
Oh.
Did you not sleep again last night?
No, and it's been three nights in a row.
Have you tried drinking warm milk before going to bed?
No, I can't drink warm milk.
It reminds me of the time Cousin Enoch fell into the vat of milk at the dairy.
Goodness.
Was he hurt?
Oh, no.
In fact, it began the annual tradition of the St. Olaf milk diving tournament.
I won three times in the low fat division.
Eventually they discontinued the event when several spectators were caught dipping their Oreo cookies in their winter swim trunks.
I'll get it.
Why don't you just take a sleeping pill?
I don't like to take pills.
I get slap happy and say silly things.
Well, we certainly wouldn't want that to happen.
- Hi, it's me Stan.
- What do you want?
I have a surprise for Dorothy.
What?
Now that you're off the blood pressure medicine it's working again?
My God, Sophia.
Is there anything Dorothy didn't tell you about us?
Actually, yes.
I didn't know she was pregnant until four days after the wedding.
Hi, Sophia.
Remember me, Stan's brother Ted?
I danced with you at their wedding.
Where were you when they divorced?
I was looking for someone to dance with then.
Ted, what a surprise!
It's great to see you again.
- What about me, babe?
- Go hug a landmine.
Blanche, Rose, this is my little brother Ted.
Charmed I'm sure.
Oh, there's my new Vanity Fair.
He just flew in from Minneapolis.
Minneapolis, Minnesota?
No, Rose, Minneapolis, France.
- Oh, I'm from Minnesota.
- I'm from Minnesota, too.
Then you just moved to France?
Welcome to my life.
It's nice meeting you, Ted, but I have to go to work.
What do you do?
She's Gary Hart's campaign manager.
It doesn't pay much but you don't have to get out of bed to do it.
Right, I'd better change.
So, Ted, what brings you to Miami?
I'll grab any chance I can to spend time with the greatest guy in the world.
My kid brother still looks up to me.
As well he should.
After all, Ted is just a doctor and a pillar of his community.
While, on the other hand, you were the king of padded toilet seats.
Hey, they sold real well for a while.
Even put our daughter through college.
They got me through some tough times, too.
So, uh, Ted, did I hear someone say you were a doctor?
He's not just a doctor.
He happens to be one of the top neurosurgeons in the midwest.
- Get out of here.
- He's also into real estate.
No, it's nothing much really.
I just own a few mini-malls.
Oh, your wife must be very proud of you.
Actually, we're divorced.
Oh, I'm terribly, terribly sorry.
Love your shirt.
Nice segueway, Blanche.
You know, I've never met a neurosurgeon before.
I would love to hear more about your work.
How about 8:00 tonight?
That sounds good but I think Stan might have something planned.
I did have ringside seats at the mud wrestling palace but, hey, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.
Elegantly put, Stan.
Well, I guess we're on.
We better get going, Ted.
We want to get a parking space at the nude beach before those perverts show up.
- See you tonight, doctor.
- Uh-huh.
Well, that was pretty embarrassing.
I know, but what could I do?
He just practically threw himself at me.
Well, goodnight, Blanche.
What's your hurry.
Come in for a nightcap.
- I don't want to put you out.
- I like to put out.
I mean, it's no trouble.
You know, being a doctor it must be deeply fulfilling to be able to lay your hands on someone and bring them back to full, pulsating vitality.
I've always believed that the body cures itself.
We doctors just help it along.
Actually, I'm starting to feel a little hot.
What do you suppose could be causing that?
Have you checked your thermostat?
Why don't you check it for me.
Okay, where is it?
You spent nine years in med school.
Find it yourself.
Hi, Blanche.
Hi, Ted.
- How was your date?
- It's not over yet.
- What are you doing up?
- I still can't sleep.
I don't want to seem insensitive, Rose, but that's your problem.
Get out.
Blanche, that does seem a little insensitive.
No, it's not.
You're just tired.
- Oh, okay.
I'm sorry I interrupted.
- That's okay.
I better be going.
No, now you stay right where you are.
Now, Rose, go to bed.
- I can't sleep.
- Try counting sheep.
I can't count sheep, I'm allergic to wool.
I got to 23 and I broke out in hives.
That's when I started counting the members of the Jackson family.
Michael, Janet, LaToya, Tito - Rose!
- Then there's Stonewall Jackson but I don't remember him on the Victory Tour.
Blanche, I'd better be going now.
All right, but before you do I just want to thank you for a lovely evening.
I guess he bought dinner.
Sophia.
Don't mind me.
The best of Carson's coming on.
- In here?
- No, Blanche, in Hollywood, but they pipe it through these little wires and it comes out here.
I really have to say good night now.
Thanks for everything.
Why?
You didn't get everything.
- Hi, Ted.
- Hi, Dorothy.
How was your date with Blanche?
I don't know.
Maybe I'm old-fashioned but when I was dating, the man used to make all the moves.
How many men have you dated?
No, I know what you meant and I don't think that's old-fashioned.
I think it's kind of nice.
- How did you spend your evening?
- Parent-teacher meetings.
Five hours of saying things like, "Well, your little Betty is a joy but she's going to have to trim her mohawk if wants to play Mary in the Christmas play".
Sounds like you need to unwind.
I think I need to retire.
Look, I know it's late but could we go for a drink?
Sure, yeah, I'll settle for that.
Four nights in a row and I still can't sleep.
Please, I haven't had a decent nights sleep since I was 70.
I shouldn't complain.
I mean, four nights is nothing compared to Elsa Yuderruden back in St. Olaf.
She stayed awake for 17 straight days in a rocking chair marathon.
She couldn't have done it without moral support of her children and her husband.
And his cattle prod.
Okay, that's it.
Drink this.
It's a secret potion from the old country guaranteed to put you to sleep.
Looks like milk.
Trust me, Rose.
Drink it, slowly.
That's right, down the hatch.
We call this Sicilian Sominex.
Now, you might feel a slight tingling.
But, believe me, you'll sleep like a baby.
I don't feel any tingling, when's it gonna hit me?
Sophia!
What are you doing?
I was making a soufflé and it got away from me.
Morning, ladies.
The way you leave that back door open, any idiot could walk in.
Any idiot did.
So, Blanche, va-va-va-voom, huh?
What?
Last night, with Ted.
Cha, cha, cha.
Tango, tango, olé.
Nobody here speaks Spanish, Stan.
- Stan, what are you talking about?
- I get it.
Play dumb.
I can play dumb.
Play, you could manage the team.
Just tell me where Ted is.
Is he still asleep?
Stan, it's not what you think.
Hey, I read you, babe.
Mum's the word.
He's in the shower, right?
Yo, Ted!
Stanley, your brother isn't here.
Where is he?
Well, how should I know?
He left last night around 11:30.
- That doesn't make sense.
- You're telling me.
Well, this is strange.
He didn't call, he didn't come home.
It's not like Ted.
I've gotta go find him.
Could've gotten mugged.
He could be lying out in a gutter, bleeding to death.
It's worse than I thought.
What the hell are you doing with my brother?
Calm down, Stanley.
It's just a routine search.
I can't believe you're so desperate you'd stoop to this.
- You can't talk to me that way.
- I was talking to Ted!
- Let's go!
- Look, Stan.
I'm not a child.
- I'll go when I'm ready.
- Good for you, Ted.
- Okay, I'm ready.
- All right.
I'll call you later.
I can't believe what just happened.
I think you owe me an explanation.
Well, Ted and I I don't have to stand here and listen to this.
- Ma, don't give me that look.
- What look?
I didn't do anything wrong.
Ted and I just talked last night.
Right, and the Godfather made all his money selling olive oil.
Blanche, if I thought for a second that there was anything between you and Ted, I never would have done what I did.
What did you do, Dorothy?
She spent the night with Ted.
But Ted was your date, Blanche.
Dorothy, you must have slept with somebody else.
Blanche, I didn't steal your date.
Ted told me that you had absolutely nothing in common.
Well, obviously.
He's dull, boring and has dubious taste, to say the least.
If that is some schoolgirl attempt to get my goat you're wasting your breath.
I'm simply questioning how any man could possibly choose you over me.
It's not working, Blanche.
I suppose there could be some exceptions.
Convicts who haven't seen a woman in 25 years It's still not working, you bimbo.
How childish to resort to name calling, you Jezebel.
- Floozy.
- Tramp.
I?
I am a tramp?
Blanche, have you heard the latest ad campaigns?
Join the Navy, see the world, sleep with Blanche Devereaux?
Join the Army, be all you can be, sleep with Blanche Devereaux?
The Marines are looking for a few good men who have not slept with Blanche Devereaux.
Just what are you trying to imply?
- Slut!
- Trash!
Now, girls, settle down before you says something you'll both regret.
Know what her problem is?
She cannot stand to see anyone else happy.
Calm down, Dorothy.
I'll brew you some tea.
- I don't want any tea.
- But this is a special blend.
It's very soothing.
- Have you been drinking much of this?
- Only at night when I can't sleep.
This is loaded with caffeine.
But we need caffeine, especially women our age.
Or our bones will get brittle and we'll walk all stooped over.
That's calcium, Rose.
Calcium, not caffeine.
This is what has been keeping you awake.
You mean, if I stop drinking that, I can sleep?
You may even blink again.
I've gotta get to the counseling center.
Honey, come on, take the day off.
Call them.
But those people need me.
What good can you possibly be to them?
Well, I'll be there, I'll smile, I'll nod.
Fortunately, a lot of them hear voices.
I'll just tell them one of them is mine.
- Having a nice time, Dorothy?
- Wonderful.
Me too.
This reminds me of when we were kids, and you and Stan double dated with me and Lois Bernbaum.
Yeah, we went to Roseland, and you and I did the jitterbug.
And afterwards, to Louie's for a malt?
That's when Stan did his walrus imitation, with the straws up his nose.
- Sure have come a long way since then.
- Yeah.
Now Stan uses breadsticks.
I had quite a crush on you.
- You did?
- Sure did.
And that's why I'm glad we're here together tonight.
I know it may seem sudden but there is something very important - I wanna ask you.
- Anything, Ted.
- Uh, may I cut in?
- Oh, hell.
Hey, Stan, it's good to see you.
What a coincidence, huh?
Look, I'll be back at the table.
- But - No, it's okay.
Hey, we got all night.
You two enjoy, huh?
Gatling, party of two.
Dorothy, you're not moving.
It reminds me of our wedding night.
Stanley, I don't wanna dance with you.
Dorothy, please.
This is really important.
Today, Ted called the airline and booked two seats for Acapulco.
- What does that mean to you?
- He doesn't have a travel agent.
No, you don't understand.
The last time he went to Acapulco, - he got married.
- So?
Last time I went to Coney Island, I got pregnant.
What's your point?
He made reservations at the same hotel.
He's wearing my most expensive aftershave, don't you see?
He's gonna pop the question.
You're being ridiculous.
You're jumping to conclusions.
Besides, it's none of your business anyway.
Good night.
Shafter, party of three.
- Ted, I told Dorothy about Acapulco.
- You heard me make the reservations?
Yes, and I think it's a terrible mistake.
You mean, it's true?
Well, yes.
I don't know what to say.
I hope you'll say yes.
Ted, I think there's something you should know about Dorothy.
She snores like a freight train.
Who cares, she's still a great gal.
Hey, guy, you're a wealthy doctor, you could have gorgeous women crawling at your feet.
Why waste your time with Dorothy?
- I think you're a little out of line.
- I'm not knocking Dorothy.
What would you call this, a testimonial?
Okay, okay.
I'm gonna have to be blunt.
Ted, all your life, you've looked up to me, and you've envied me for everything I have.
- That's why you wanna marry Dorothy.
- Marry Dorothy?
What are you talking about?
Come on, Acapulco, the El Presidenté, you're planning something big.
Well, yeah.
I met this great looking stewardess on the flight and I asked her to go to Acapulco and she could only go if I found a sitter for her two kids.
Hey, I'd really appreciate it.
Come again.
They are great kids.
One of them plays with matches, but you don't smoke, do you?
Teddy, you old stud.
Hey, hey, hey.
I mean, you hang around the master long enough, you're gonna pick up a few tricks.
Listen, uh Ted, I hate to interrupt What was all that sweet talk about your having a crush on me?
Well, I mean, I did, but that was a long time ago.
Yeah, but What about last night?
Well, I'll always remember last night as a very special evening.
It was.
It was a very special evening.
And that's why I'm going to keep that deep dark secret about yourself that you told me strictly between the two of us.
Uh, thank you, I appreciate it.
Don't mention it.
Good night, Ted.
And goodbye.
Goodbye.
Collins, party of two, please.
Oh, uh, may I borrow this for a minute?
Uh, ladies and gentlemen,  may I have your attention, please.
The gentleman at table five in the blue suit is impotent.
Bon appetit.
Rose.
Oh, Rose.
Honey, did you finally get to sleep?
Wake up, I have to talk to someone.
Oh, not now, I wanna sleep.
Rose, listen, Dorothy's so upset with me, and I don't blame her after all those things I said.
- Mmm.
- You know, I just don't see how I'll ever face her again.
Rose, listen.
Listen.
Am I a terrible person?
I don't know.
Who are you?
It's me, Blanche.
Oh, Blanche.
You're not a terrible person.
You're just horny all the time.
- Rose, it's Dorothy.
- Oh, gosh.
I can't talk to her, not now.
Oh!
Rose, honey.
- Are you awake?
- I don't know.
Oh, that's good enough.
I need to talk to someone.
Rose, it's been a terrible night.
Ted turned out to be as big a jerk as Blanche said he was.
- Ted who?
- Never mind.
How did I let myself get involved?
How could I allow a man to come between me and my best friend.
Blanche is never gonna forgive me.
I forgive you.
Where did you come from?
- I was hiding behind the drapes.
- What is this, Hamlet?
I just didn't want to face you after all those things I said.
- Honey, honey, I understand.
- Well I understand why you were so upset.
I'm not really sure you do, Dorothy.
You see I threw myself at Ted and he just tossed me aside like a ratty old pair of sweat socks.
Well, I'm not like you, Dorothy.
I'm not used to that kind of humiliation.
I've never told anyone this before, but I have a fragile ego.
It'll be our little secret.
Rose?
Don't worry.
I found something to put you to sleep.
She's asleep already.
What?
After I spent all day making her this Sicilian sleeping potion?
Oh, Ma, come on.
Hey, this saved my Uncle Giuseppe's life.
One swig and he slept through the Allied invasion.
Ma, that's ridiculous.
Here, take a sip.
Wow, this stuff really works.
I've gotta remember what I put in this.
Takes so little to make her happy.
- Good night, Blanche.
- Good night, Dorothy.
Rose, good Dorothy?
Dorothy?
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Thank you for being a friend  Traveled down the road and back again  Your heart is true  You're a pal and a confidant  And if you threw a party  Invited everyone you knew  You would see  The biggest gift would be from me  And the card attached would say  Thank you for being a friend  Dorothy, I want a driver's license.
What for?
I'm doing a lot of stuntwork in the new Burt Reynolds movie.
Why do you think?
Ma, you haven't driven in years.
Why is this coming up now?
This morning at the center, Gladys Weinstock and I had a fight.
We both claim we're natural redheads, but of course at our age we can't prove it anymore.
So?
So, when I pulled out my license to show her, everyone saw it was expired.
It made me feel old, Dorothy.
- I want to learn again.
- Oh, come on.
Ma, you're 81 years old.
Your eyesight is weaker.
Your reflexes are slower.
And who are you, Magic Johnson?
Dorothy, please.
Oh, all right, Ma, we'll give it a try.
But, Ma, if anything goes wrong we stop.
Relax.
There are some things you never forget.
Driving a car is like making love.
In both cases, a mirror makes objects appear larger than they really are.
Oh, Dorothy, I'm just so angry!
Floyd McCallan just called me one hour before he's supposed to pick me up in his brand new two-tone Mercedes.
- He's canceled our date for tonight!
- He probably had a good reason.
He said he had to go visit his sick mother in the hospital.
Did you ever hear such a weak excuse?
And his mother isn't in the hospital.
Of course she is, but he can visit her anytime.
He can only see me tonight.
- Is my cousin Sven here yet?
- No, Rose.
Oh, good.
I got caught up at work and I barely had time to pick up a cake.
I wanted to make Sven feel welcome.
Rose, that cake is from the "Get it While it's Hot" erotic bake shop.
Whoa!
Why, Rose Nylund!
Why, that cake is in the shape Blanche, we know what it is.
I thought it was in the shape of Florida.
That reminds me, I've got to give Charlie Milburne a call.
If this cake reminds you of Charlie Milburne, we could both give him a call.
Rose, how long is your cousin Sven going to, uh,  be, uh, staying here with us?
Oh, just a couple of days.
On Saturday he's flying back to St. Olaf to meet his fiancée.
Oh, she went all alone?
No, he's never met her.
It's an arranged marriage.
See, little Sven's father, we call him Big Sven, left the old country two years ago and settled in St. Olaf.
Then he sent for the rest of his family.
First he brought his father over.
We call him "Big Sven," too.
Well, doesn't that get confusing, having two Big Svens?
There aren't, Blanche.
There's Big Sven and Big Sven II.
Like Jaws and Jaws II.
Rose, are any of your relatives named Psycho and Psycho II?
Anyway, Big Sven picked out a bride for little Sven and now he's flying him over.
I don't know, it seems so unfair to me, an arranged marriage.
I don't know, Dorothy.
It can be fun.
George and I had that kind of marriage.
George would dress up as a ghost and chase me around the house with one of those little fly swatters.
Then when he caught me, he'd Blanche, I'm talking about arranged marriages not deranged marriages.
Oh.
Sorry.
Oh, that must be Sven!
- Cousin Rose?
- Cousin Sven!
Oh!
Oh, let me look at you.
Boy have you grown!
We've never met.
But admit it, you have grown!
Uh, Rose, could you introduce Blanche and me.
Of course.
Dorothy, this is Blanche.
Blanche, this is Dorothy.
We have jokes like that around here all the time.
It's like living in a house full of Howie Mandels.
- Sven, I'm Dorothy.
- Hello.
- And I'm Blanche.
Welcome.
- Thank you.
Rose tells us you're getting married.
Yes, and I hope I'm good at it.
I don't have that much experience with women.
A big, strong, handsome thing like you?
Get out of here.
Well, it was nice meeting all of you.
Oh, that was an expression!
Sven!
I never thought I'd say this but I think Rose got the brains in that family.
Meet me out front, Dorothy.
I'm gonna pull the car around.
Ma, hold it.
Hold it.
I told you last night, we don't do any driving until we've gone over all the rules in the driving manual.
What's to go over?
"How much distance should there be between you and a fire hydrant"?
What am I, a poodle?
-  Morning, girls.
-  Morning.
Hey, what got you two up and out so early?
I wanted to show Sven as many of the sights as possible today.
Did he get a picture with that Mr. Whipple cutout at the A&P?
We stopped to pick up breakfast before we started off on our big day.
Will you ladies join us?
- What are you making?
- Flendahueven.
- What's that?
- Oatmeal.
It's usually served with a cracker made from yak intestine.
Of course!
Yak snacks.
Hi, girls.
Hi, Swin.
- It's Sven, Blanche.
- Whatever.
Dorothy, could I borrow your white wind breaker?
Floyd is taking me sailing today on his yacht.
Uh, Blanche I guess he felt so guilty about canceling last night he wanted to do something extra special.
- Uh, Blanche - I can just hardly wait.
- Blanche - If you're about to tell me Floyd canceled, I don't want to hear it.
- He called.
- Oh!
This is the last straw!
This is it!
I don't care if Floyd does own the most successful pet neutering business in greater Miami.
As of this minute, I am never speaking to that lowdown scuzzball ever again!
-  - He changed his mind!
Hello.
Yes, this is Rose.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Well, okay.
Bye.
Sven, I have some bad news.
- Is it bad news?
- Yes, it's bad.
Were you two the cousins who play the banjo in Deliverance?
- Rose, what's wrong?
- That was the center.
I have to work today.
Now who's gonna show Sven the sights?
The only sights we're seeing is the empty lot behind the mall.
I already showed him that.
Wait a minute.
I have an idea.
Blanche, you're free.
Why don't you take Sven around?
I don't think I feel like sightseeing.
- It might do you good.
- I know it'll do you good.
And it's certainly a lot healthier than sitting here in the house stewing all day.
Maybe you're right.
An active day out on the town with a handsome young man might take my mind completely off old - what's-his-name.
-  Floyd.
Okay, come on, Swin.
It's Sven.
He's mine now, I can call him what I want to.
If you don't mind, Blanche, I'd like to pay for lunch.
Oh, don't be silly, Swin.
I mean it.
You gave me a great tour of the city today.
I don't think we have that many women shoe stores in my whole country.
Oh, my Lord!
Look who just walked in.
- Who?
- Floyd.
Look at that young thing with him.
- Why, she's half his age!
- She's half your age.
- Shut up and hold my hand.
- What?
Hold my hand.
Now look deep into my eyes.
Look like you want to kiss me.
Okay, move your lips around.
Go like this.
- Blanche, I don't - Okay, get ready to kiss me.
- Blanche - Get set.
- Blanche - Go!
Blanche, is that you?
Well, Floyd McCallan!
Oh, shame on you, sneaking up on us like that.
And in front of this young child, too.
- Blanche, this is Linda.
- Hello, Linda.
Is your daddy taking you out to lunch?
- Linda's just a friend.
- Oops.
Oh, Floyd, I'm just so embarrassed at you, catching me and Swin like this.
Of course, you should've seen us a few minutes ago.
We were feeding each other.
Blanche, look, about those dates I canceled Honey, forget all about that, I know I have.
- Blanche, can I call you later?
- Oh, sure, if you want to.
I'm not sure I'll be at home.
I just suddenly have this craving for dessert.
Come on, Swin, we're going to your place.
Okay, we can try, but I've never sailed around the Cape of Good Hope this time of year.
I am never getting into a car with you again.
Ever.
I can't believe you're being such a wimp.
Ma, you went through the stop sign, you hit a mailbox, you almost ran over Mrs. Burlfine!
The woman's already in a wheelchair.
How much more damage could I do?
Hi, Dorothy.
Why is your lipstick all smeared?
I just kissed our driveway.
- Hi, everybody.
- Hello, Rose.
Oh, hi, Rose.
Would you consider teaching me how to drive?
Sure, Sophia.
How about this.
I teach you how to drive and you teach me how to be a great Italian cook?
Everybody's a comedian today.
Rose, everything okay down at the counseling center?
Yes, finally.
We had a manic depressive overload.
Luckily Dr. Ferguson had heard some new knock-knock jokes and that seemed to do the trick.
-  Knock-knock?
- Who's there?
Oh, shut up, Rose!
Hello, ladies.
Hi, Cousin Rose.
Sven, hi.
I want to do something special in honor of your wedding.
What are you in the mood for?
Oh, Cousin Rose, there isn't going to be a wedding.
What?
Why not?
Because I decided I can't marry someone that I don't love.
You've never even met Olga.
How do you know you don't?
Because I know I'm in love with someone else.
I'm in love with Blanche.
Swin, you can't be serious.
You're not in love with me.
Yes I am, Blanche.
I know it's sudden, but I feel it in my heart.
His father is gonna kill me.
I'm in charge of Sven for one day and he falls for the first little floozy that turns his head.
Blanche, did something happen between you and Sven that we don't know about?
You didn't tell them about kissing me?
Kissing him?
Or stroking my hair?
Stroking his hair?
Or feeding me?
All right, I'll say it.
Feeding him?
I can't hear any more of this.
Blanche, how could you do this to me?
Rose, wait a minute.
I can explain everything.
It's not like you think.
If Sven said you kissed him, you kissed him.
I did kiss him, but it was just pretend.
We were having lunch at Fairview Gardens.
Well, Floyd McCallan walked in with another woman.
So I pretended Swin was my boyfriend just to make Floyd jealous.
Did you explain any of this to Sven?
I assumed he knew.
Blanche, how could you assume anything?
The man offered to kill dinner for us last night.
Maybe I made a mistake, but I don't think I did anything so terrible.
Well, I do!
There is a sweet, innocent man whose heart is gonna get broken because you decided to use him in one of your petty games.
That's only one side of it.
Look at the other side.
He did get to kiss me.
Big deal.
More people get to kiss you than the Pope's ring.
You have to go in there and talk to him.
I will, I will.
It's just that I'm not very good at it.
I was blessed with one talent, turning men on.
I've just never known how to turn them off.
You tell him, Dorothy.
I would, Blanche, but remember, we just want to turn him off, not drain the sex drive completely out of him!
You know, I've always had this trouble ever since high school.
I was the head cheerleader and I was dating our star quarterback, Calwell Honeycutt.
Well, time came to break up but I just could not tell Calwell to his face.
I couldn't bear to inflict that much grief and suffering on one man.
So I finally decided that the best way to handle it was just to lead my girls in a farewell cheer.
Two-four-six-eight, who will Blanche no longer date?
Calwell.
Did he get the message, or did the band have to spell out "buzz off' at half-time?
You have to go and set Sven straight.
The longer you wait, the harder it'll get.
I know.
You're right.
I will.
Of course she's right.
You know, I once made the same mistake myself.
I was dating a guy my parents could not stand.
He used to come over to the house during Sunday dinner, help himself to some food, take it into the living room, turn on one of those radio countdown shows and belch to the music.
Finally my mother told me that I just had to break it off and of course I knew she was right.
So I rehearsed my speech and I made arrangements to meet him at a coffee shop.
I got there five minutes early and caught him necking with a waitress.
-  Oh!
- That must've made it easier.
No, I still could not do it.
How long had you been together with this guy?
Thirty-eight years.
That was Stan?
And you know, to this day, he can belch out the chorus to Sweet Georgia Brown on one Dr. Pepper.
Well, I'm gonna go talk to Swin.
I'll just let him down gently.
In the old country when a woman dumps a man, the man is allowed to shave the woman's head and make her wear an itchy hat.
I hear Pakistan has the same penalty for jaywalking.
- Swin.
- Hi, Blanche.
Is something wrong?
No, I'm just embarrassed about what happened before.
Embarrassed?
What for?
- For acting so crazy.
- Oh, that wasn't crazy.
Yes, we kissed one time, I let it go straight to my head.
I've been sitting here trying to understand what made me act that way.
Could it be that I'm just nervous about getting married?
Yes.
Or that I'm not used to being with a beautiful woman like you?
Yes.
Or that I'm just a naive, inexperienced man.
Yes.
No.
It's none of those things, Blanche.
It's because I like you.
- I like everything about you.
- Swin.
- You hardly know me.
- I know enough.
- I know you're pretty.
- Yes.
- You're smart.
- Yes.
- Sexy.
- Yes.
- Sophisticated.
- Yes No!
Swin, there's something very important you don't know.
Oh, I don't know how to say this.
Um, it's the reason I kissed you in the first place.
To make Floyd jealous.
- You knew that?
- Yes.
And I think you had every right.
He deserved it the way he's been rejecting you.
What do you mean rejecting me?
Well, canceling twice in two days.
Then he shows up with that girl today.
Woo!
- How old could she have been?
- Not very.
You're not like most women, Blanche, I'll tell you that.
What do you mean?
Well, wouldn't most women let a thing like this make them feel old?
Yes.
- And unattractive.
- Yes.
- Worn out.
- Yes.
Useless.
What's your point, Swin?
My point is Well, I was just hoping that maybe you're tired of people like Floyd who don't appreciate you, and maybe you're ready to spend some time with someone who does.
Like you.
I know you don't know me very well yet, but I'm just asking for a chance.
Okay, I'll think about it.
Thank you, Blanche.
You're welcome, Swin.
- Hi, Ma.
- Read it and weep.
A driver's license?
Ma, how did you get this?
Hard work and determination.
If you put your mind to it, you can do anything.
Look, Ma, I absolutely forbid you to drive a car.
Ooh, look, Dorothy, I'm shaking.
Ma, I mean it!
Lighten up.
I told you before, I only want a license to have not to use.
It's a symbol of my freedom, my independence.
Now give me 50 dollars.
What for?
A guy named Paco makes these babies up in his garage.
Good morning, girls.
I didn't sleep a wink last night worrying about Blanche and Sven.
Rose, this is between the two of them.
No, it isn't.
I'm supposed to get Sven on a plane today.
That's why I called big Sven early this morning to ask him what to do.
I knew he'd be up, he gets up with the cows.
I know he gets up with the cows because he sleeps with the cows.
What is your point, Rose?
Big Sven was furious with me.
He told me to do nothing, he'd handle everything.
Then he hung up on me.
- Good morning!
- Maybe it is for you.
Now, Rose, you can't go on being mad at me over this.
I feel just as bad as you do.
Do you have an angry Viking yelling Scandinavian swear words at you on the phone this morning?
My guess would be no.
Rose, as I told you last night, your cousin is a very sensitive man.
I just have to find the right time and place and I'll let him down softly.
Morning, everyone.
Who could that be?
- Rose Nylund?
- Yes.
Wow.
I'm Olga Nolstrom, from St. Olaf.
I'm looking for Sven Linstrom.
He's right there.
Wow.
Sven, your father sent me.
I was chosen to be your bride.
I'm not leaving this house without you.
Wow.
Uh, now might be a good time to let him down softly.
Our cab is waiting, Sven.
Will you come?
Blanche, I've done some thinking.
I could never make you happy.
If you could never make her happy, good luck with the lean, mean, Swedish machine.
I understand, Swin.
Go on.
Go on.
I'm coming, Olga.
Oh, Cousin Rose, thank you!
Thank you all.
Oh, wait.
What about my clothes?
They're ugly.
Any other questions?
I'll send them to you.
You two be on your way.
- Good luck!
- Thank you.
Thank you.
Bye!
Oh, isn't that wonderful?
Wonderful?
He just dropped me!
Oh, Blanche, come on.
You had no interest in Sven.
That's not the point, Dorothy.
The point is for the second time in two days I have been thrown over for a younger woman.
I can't I can't compete anymore.
Oh, honey, of course you can.
You just have to compete in a different way, like, with intelligence and charm.
I don't know those ways, Rose, and I'm too old to learn.
I'm over the hill, that's all there is to it.
I guess I'm just in the same boat as the two of you.
Hello?
Yes.
All right.
Goodbye.
What do you know.
Floyd McCallan is taking me sailing today.
I guess you two are in the same boat.
I'm in the yacht.
What's this boat she keeps talking about?
Don't worry, Rose.
You missed it.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Thank you for being a friend  Traveled down the road and back again  Your heart is true  You're a pal and a confidant  And if you threw a party  Invited everyone you knew  You would see  The biggest gift would be from me  And the card attached would say  Thank you for being a friend   Hi, Ma.
Oh, something smells terrific.
What is it?
Spaghetti sauce.
Here, have a taste.
Mmm.
Delicious.
Delicious?
This is the reason your father and I got married.
Girls, do you realize it has been eight days since I've had a date?
Do you realize it's been eight days since I had Ma, please.
Whatever it is, keep it to yourself.
That's my problem.
I don't understand.
I just don't seem to be able to attract as many men as I used to.
Maybe it's just the beginning of the end.
Maybe I'll never have another date again, as long as I live.
Don't be ridiculous.
Not you, Blanche.
You're right.
I am being ridiculous.
If anybody never has another date, it'll probably be you.
Thank you, Dorothy.
I feel so much better.
Hi, girls.
Guess what I'll be doing for three hours every Tuesday and Thursday night?
Cutting up your black pantyhose and putting on an Amos 'n Andy puppet show?
No, but what a great idea.
Terrific, now you have something to do on Wednesdays.
Okey-dokey.
Do you know that promotion I was up for at the counseling center?
Well, I found out I can't have it unless I become bilingual.
Oh, no, honey, don't do that.
No job is worth having to date women.
Blanche, "bilingual" refers to a person who speaks more than one language.
Oh!
Why'd I think it was something sexual?
That's why I signed up for a Spanish class at night school.
That's a wonderful idea.
Men go to night school.
Smart men.
And nothing turns me on more than a smart man.
Unless maybe it's a stupid man with good hands.
Rose, count me in.
- Dinner's ready.
- What are we having?
-  Spaghetti.
- Italian food?
No, Rose, actually it's Chinese food.
-  - I'll get it.
Now that I'm taking Spanish, I'm gonna totally immerse myself in the culture.
From now on, I'm only speaking Spanish.
I'm eating Spanish food, I'm wearing Spanish clothes, and I'm re-reading the covers of my Julio Iglesias albums really, really carefully.
Dorothy, Stan's here to see you.
Hi, everybody.
Sorry to barge in on your meal.
It's all right.
Would you like some spaghetti?
- It's delicious.
- Did you make it?
- No.
- I'd love some.
Are you here for a reason or did you come for free food?
Ma, please, the man is a guest in our home.
What the hell do you want, Stanley?
Well, it seems the IRS found a few discrepancies in my tax returns.
So I think we may have a slight problem.
Stanley, we have not been together for a long time.
Your tax return is your problem.
Not exactly.
They've decided to go over the returns for the last few years, and a few years ago, we were married.
Babe, I'm afraid we're being audited.
What?
- He said, "Babe, I'm afraid" - I heard him, Rose!
Just relax, Dorothy, sometimes they just randomly audit people.
It doesn't mean there's a problem.
There's a problem.
Oh, that's too bad.
Pass the meatballs.
Dorothy, I take total blame for this.
I know it's a bummer, but no matter what comes down, we're in this together.
I won't know till we reconstruct our finances, but I figure we probably have to pay a small fee.
That doesn't sound so bad.
Unless we get a prison term.
Don't worry, I'll come by tomorrow night, we'll sit down and go over all the receipts.
- Pass the - I will not.
Now get out, Stanley.
Calm down.
I can eat it plain.
Well, gotta go now.
See you tomorrow night.
I can't believe this is happening.
Our whole married life, I was so careful about money.
And all the time, Stanley had his hand in the cookie jar.
In the olden days, the Vikings would cut off your hand if they caught you stealing.
They'd cut out your tongue if they caught you lying.
They'd cut off your feet if they caught you trespassing.
Too bad there wasn't a Viking around when Stan knocked you up.
That means "Hello Dorothy" in Spanish.
You've really taken command of the language, haven't you?
Si.
That means "yes".
Gee, Rose, if I closed my eyes, I'd swear I was in Ecuador.
Sorry, that was me.
Okay, Rose, I'm ready for class.
You look like you're going to a cocktail party.
Well, gracias, honey.
Hi, it's me, Stan.
Come on in.
Oh, so thoughtful of you to bring garbage.
These are my tax receipts.
Our future is in this bag.
How appropriate.
- Hi, girls.
- Hi, Stan.
Blanche, you look great in that blouse.
Are those new?
I mean Is that new?
Stanley, you naughty boy.
When was the last time somebody gave you a spanking?
Vegas.
Come on, Blanche, we don't wanna be late.
Oh, darn, I keep forgetting.
I'm not supposed to speak English.
Being bilingual really gets me confused.
Ziploc bags get you confused.
- See you girls later.
- Adiós.
Sophia, you look younger than ever.
Thank you, Stan.
That's a beautiful toupee you're wearing.
There, now we're both liars.
Okay, Stan, let's get this over with.
Yeah, well, okay, here's a copy of the tax return.
We'll go over each deduction individually and document it with a receipt.
Okay.
What the hell is this?
Oh, uh, that It's a business loss.
- I made a bad investment.
- What investment?
You never told me you were investing.
Well, I actually wasn't planning to, but I knew this was a money maker the minute I laid eyes on it.
I'm talking tie bibs, babe.
Tie bibs.
Yeah.
Little bibs that fit over your necktie.
You go out to lunch, you don't worry about staining your tie.
It's a perfect gift, a great idea.
And the best part was, no one else had ever thought of it.
To this day, I don't know why I couldn't sell them.
Did you ever hear of napkins, Stanley?
Hey.
So I didn't make the cover of Fortune.
I was just trying to do something to make things better for us.
All our friends were moving up, and we were stuck with a one-way ticket to Palookaville.
I wanted to be someone, babe.
I wanted to be a contender.
Stanley, did you just rent On the Waterfront?
You know me so well.
No, I don't.
What is this $2500 deduction for a gift?
This is a receipt for the diamond ring that you gave me on our I know.
You spent $2500 on me?
Yeah.
Figured after 38 years, you deserve something major.
Listen, I know we've had our differences, but you've always stuck by me when it really counted.
I'll always love you for that.
Oh, thank you, Stanley.
Stanley, what are all these deductions for a Corvette and a rented garage?
Dorothy, don't get mad.
And don't hit me if you do.
I kind of bought a Corvette without telling you.
You bought a car without telling me?
I was going through a mid-life crisis.
So was I. I gave myself a perm and took up Jazzercise.
You bought a car without telling me?
How can I explain it?
When I sat behind the wheel, people noticed me.
People paid attention.
That car was a chick magnet.
That is it, Stanley.
That's it.
Get out.
Get out of my house.
Get out of my life.
What about the audit?
We can get into trouble.
We could wind up in jail.
Good, good.
I want you to go to jail.
And I want a big bald convict named Bubba to pick you for his girlfriend.
Dorothy, you don't mean that.
The hell I don't.
This is all your fault.
Look, it doesn't matter who's to blame here.
We're in this together.
If you don't wanna cooperate, - you're gonna be hurting yourself.
- You're right.
And I hate you for it.
What's all the racket?
Oh, nothing.
I could just murder Stan.
He bought a Corvette without telling me.
Why are you complaining?
Your father did things without telling me.
How do you think I got pregnant with your brother Phil?
Just remember, I'll handle everything.
I'm a salesman.
I deal with people.
I know what I'm doing.
Shut up, Stanley.
Mellow out.
Once we get in there, we have to exercise psychological control.
- That's why I'm wearing this suit.
- You make me sick.
Hey, everyone knows good guys wear white.
This suit subliminally tells the auditor I'm a good guy.
I could vomit just looking at you.
Mr. And Mrs. Zbornak, step into my office, please.
Watch me work my magic, babe.
Good afternoon.
I am Wendell Murray.
I'll be conducting your audit.
Nice to meet you.
I'm Dorothy Zbornak.
This is my ex-husband, Stanley.
Wendell.
Paisan.
We're going to jail.
What did you call me?
Before he answers that, let me reiterate, we are bitterly divorced.
Relax, Dorothy.
Wendell, I called you "paisan".
Friend, brother of the scalp.
If I may get philosophical for one moment, I've always believed we bald men are like any other minority.
- That's why we have to stick together.
- Who you calling bald?
Nobody, nobody.
Just shut up and put your hair on.
Yes, dear.
Wendell, if I may call you Wendell, did I mention that I'm a member of the Rainbow Coalition?
Mr. And Mrs. Zbornak, may I remind you that as an employee of the IRS, it is my sole obligation to see that the government gets all the money it has coming to it?
- And I'll bet you do a fine job of it.
- Thank you.
However, I have no personal stake in this whatsoever.
Is that understood?
- Oh, yes.
Yes.
- You bet, my man.
Then cut the crap, paisan.
You know, folks, I've been at this job almost four years now, and in that short time I can honestly say I have never seen such an inept, clumsy, downright stupid attempt to avoid paying income tax.
Thanks.
That means a lot coming from you.
I can also honestly say that I'm amazed the way this lays out, you only owe a small amount.
- You're kidding.
- No.
$5000.
$5000 We don't have that kind of money.
Uncle Sam doesn't like to hear that.
Aunt Dorothy doesn't enjoy saying it.
We'll expect you each to cough up $2500 in 30 days.
What if we can't?
We'll put a lien on your bank accounts, property, and your salaries.
And if that doesn't work, we'll just have to incarcerate you.
Oh, my God.
We're going to jail.
That's right, Stanley.
Please, let me know where you and Bubba register for your china.
Rose, honey, what are you still doing up?
Studying for my Spanish test.
Like somebody else I know should be.
Don't strain yourself.
Here.
Blanche, these are the answers to the test.
Where did you get these?
I'll give you one guess.
You slept with the teacher.
Of course I didn't sleep with the teacher.
You have to be very careful these days.
I promised I would if he gave me the answers.
I call it "safe-teasing".
Well, you can just have them back.
I've only cheated once in my life.
- I vowed I'd never do it again.
- Couldn't handle the guilt?
No, I got caught.
Oh, it was the worst experience of my whole life.
St. Olaf was rocked by the scandal.
What'd you do, shortchange somebody down at the feed store?
Worse.
I fed BB's to my prize lamb, Harlan, so he'd weigh in heavier at the county fair.
Oh, my God, Rose.
How do you sleep at night?
I knew it was wrong all along, but I wanted to win first prize.
And I would have if Harlan could have held it just a little longer.
Boy, did you just miss a real gem.
Poor Dorothy, what are you doing up again?
I can't sleep.
Every time I close my eyes, I see Uncle Sam going through my purse.
Worried about the money you owe the government?
No, Blanche, I'm worried about whether Michael Jackson will be able to buy the remains of the Elephant Man.
Really?
Gee, I'd be worried about the money.
Does anyone around here ever go to bed?
I can't sleep, Ma.
I can't work, I can't eat.
All I can do is think about how I'm gonna raise the rest of that 2500 bucks.
- I wish I had it, pussycat.
- Oh, I know, Ma.
If you had it, you'd give it to me.
Don't put words in my mouth.
I said, "I wish I had it".
I've put away a little money, Dorothy.
It's not nearly enough, but you're welcome to it.
Oh, Rose.
I could lend you a couple of hundred.
I'd planned on putting it toward my cruise to the Bahamas, - but what the heck?
- Oh, thank you, girls.
I'll just buy a couple I really appreciate this.
And limbo under the clothesline.
- But I can't accept it.
- Okay.
I only have half of the 2500.
And since I don't qualify for a bank loan, I'm just gonna have to sell some of my stuff.
Hold it.
No daughter of mine is selling her stuff.
It's a sin, it's a crime, and let's face it, Dorothy, lately you can't give it away.
Ma, I'm talking about selling some of my belongings.
I called a couple of pawn shops and I'm gonna check them out tomorrow.
I'm wonderful at bargaining.
I'll go with you.
- Me, too.
- Oh, thanks, girls.
Oh You know, I can't believe this is happening.
I was so careful about my finances all my life.
I thought that by now I'd have some sort of security.
And here I am, flat broke.
I know what you mean.
I never dreamt I'd be single and working at this age.
I never dreamt I'd be this age.
Let me tell you girls the three most important things I learned about life.
Number one: Hold fast to your friends.
Number two: There's no such thing as security.
And number three: Don't go see Ishtar.
Now girls, listen.
Listen.
Remember, the way to make a deal is we state our price, stick to our guns, and undo another button on our blouses.
Blanche, that is ridiculous.
Unbuttoning my blouse is not gonna get us a better deal.
You are absolutely right.
Don't touch yours.
Rose and I will unbutton ours.
Hi.
Please, don't hurt me, just take my money.
I'm sorry.
I think I got my verbs mixed up.
Thanks a lot, lady.
So, what do you want?
I would like to pawn a few things.
- You got a lot of things here.
- Yeah.
So, uh, how much will you give me?
$100 for everything.
- Oh.
- Wait a minute.
Sir!
I am shocked at your insensitivity.
May I point out to you that this is no ordinary pitcher?
This pitcher was carried thousands of miles across the ocean by her great-great-grandmother.
A woman who came to this country in search of a better life, as have done millions of immigrants throughout history.
Why, this pitcher is a symbol of freedom.
This pitcher is a symbol of liberty.
This pitcher was made in Taiwan.
Well!
Maybe they stopped off at the Ellis Island gift shop.
The point is, this pitcher is worth a considerable amount of money.
Lady, that story is worth more than the pitcher.
In fact, except for the ring that you are wearing, nothing that you brought in here is worth anything.
- How much for the ring?
- $800.
Oh, I couldn't pawn this.
- $900.
- Take it, Dorothy.
No, I couldn't, it This is the only nice thing that Stan ever gave me.
- $1000.
- It's also the only valuable thing.
- Hock it.
- I can't.
$1200.
My final offer.
No, this isn't for sale.
I mean, there are some things that have no price.
I This means a lot to me.
My husband gave it to me after 38 years of marriage.
And after 38 years of marriage, he also dumped you for a 23-year-old stewardess with firm thighs and perky breasts.
You got yourself a ring, muchacho.
-  Hi Dorothy.
- Hi.
What are you two doing here?
I thought you had Spanish class.
We do but we're not going.
We dropped out.
What about your promotion at the counseling center?
Oh, I can just forget about that.
Norwegians are notoriously bad at Spanish.
I guess that's why there are no herring tacos.
And it was a big waste of my time.
There was only one cute guy there.
And he kept doodling the name "Kenny" in his notebook.
- Hi, Dorothy.
- Come on in.
I have the check for my half of the money.
- Hi, girls.
- Hi, Stan.
Hi, Stan.
Where's your hair?
Oh, damn.
I never should have opened that sunroof.
This just isn't my week.
Here you go.
Thanks, Dorothy.
Uh, Dorothy, uh, listen.
I, um I'm really sorry about all of this.
It's all my fault.
Here.
A little something for you.
My ring.
I didn't want you to sell it.
Not like this.
- How did you know?
- I called while you were out.
Sophia told me what happened, so I went and bought it back.
Stanley, you didn't have to do that.
I wanted to do it, Dorothy.
Because, in spite of everything, you're still the best.
I think I'm gonna cry.
Honey, don't do that.
Your eyes will get all beady, and your nose will swell up like Karl Malden.
Wait a minute, if you bought the ring back, how did you come up with the money?
Sold the Corvette.
- You didn't.
- Yeah, it was tough.
I had great times with that car, but the times I had with you were a hell of a lot more important.
Oh, Stanley.
I'm so sorry.
Me too.
I guess I became what I always feared most: Another middle-aged bald guy who drives a Toyota.
Oh, Stanley, this This is the nicest thing anyone's ever done for me.
Rose, honey.
Let's go down to Riley's and see if we can meet some men.
Come on.
- Come on.
- Okay.
If you're taking Biscayne Blvd.
, keep an eye out for my hair.
We, um, really pulled it out of the fire, didn't we, babe?
We sure did.
It felt nice, you and me, working as a team again.
It did feel nice.
Reminds me of when we were first married.
We sure had some good times.
So, as long as I'm here, what do you say, for old time's sake, you wanna go to bed?
Dorothy!
Dorothy, let go, it was a joke.
You're hurting me.
You're really hurting me.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Thank you for being a friend  Traveled down the road and back again  Your heart is true  You're a pal and a confidante  And if you threw a party  Invited everyone you knew  You would see The biggest gift would be from me  And the card attached would say  Thank you for being a friend  Oh, hello.
We have a 2:00 appointment with Dr. Ashley.
The name is Zbornak.
My name's not Zbornak.
My name is Devereaux.
But the appointment is in the name of Zbornak.
Why your name?
It was my idea to get counseling.
Take the appointment for Zbornak and change it to Nylund.
You satisfied?
The appointment should be under Devereaux.
- Under Nylund.
- Change it back to Zbornak.
Put it under Lipschitz and buzz the head shrinker.
We got an emergency here.
-  - Ladies.
I'm Dr. Ashley.
Come into my office.
I'm Sophia Petrillo, and my idea of a good psychiatrist is a bartender who pours without a spout.
- Doctor, I'm Dorothy Zbornak.
- Dorothy.
- I'm Rose Nylund.
- Rose.
I'm Blanche Devereaux.
It's not pertinent at the moment, but I'm double-jointed.
That's very interesting.
Dr. Ashley, the reason we came is that we're roommates having problems at home that we need to work out.
Before we get to the nitty-gritty, tell me a little about yourselves.
- Fine.
I'm a teacher.
I'm divorced.
-  I'm a widow.
No man would leave me unless he absolutely had to.
I'm 41 years old, I'm 5'6", I weigh 108 pounds, and my hair is its natural hue.
Sure, Blanche.
Yours and Lucy's.
What about you, Rose?
Well, to be perfectly honest, I use a touch of peroxide.
- Oh, shut up, Rose.
- You shut up.
Now, stop it.
Stop it!
I cannot stand it anymore!
You know what I can't stand?
That phony accent of yours.
What is this, Designing Women?
We have been together for five years.
We're getting on each other's nerves.
Why is that?
- Dorothy is impossible to live with.
- That's right.
The real problem is you, Blanche.
You are selfish.
Oh, please.
Everybody says what a giving person I am.
She's talking about when you're in an upright position.
Dorothy, give an example of how Blanche is selfish.
All right, fine.
Let's say, oh, about a month ago, I was not feeling very well.
I was sick as a dog.
I'll be ready in a minute.
I had Hannah do my makeup while my pedicure was drying, so all I have to do is change my shoes.
Wait a minute.
What are you doing?
I think I'm dying.
But then again, this 104 fever may be clouding my judgment.
Look at what you're wearing.
You can't go like that.
I think the funeral home has someone who handles that, Blanche.
But thank you for caring.
I'm talking about our double date.
Good grief!
This place looks like a hospital ward.
Mike and Larry will be here any minute.
Blanche, I can't go out tonight.
Look at me.
But, Dorothy, you've looked much worse than this.
Remember that time you gave yourself a home perm, burnt your hair right down to the roots and ended up looking like Buckwheat?
I meant, Blanche, that I am sick.
I can barely stand.
You'll just have to go on without me.
Go on without you?
This is not a wagon train.
This is a double date.
It doesn't work that way.
It's both of us or nothing.
You'll just have to cancel your date, too.
Cancel my date?
With Larry?
Dorothy, how long have you been inhaling this VapoRub?
Blanche Dorothy, I have been waiting for Larry to ask me out ever since our eyes first met at Del's Route 1 Chevron.
I climbed on the hood of his LeBaron and wrote my phone number on his windshield with the heel of my Pappagallo pump.
Isn't that how Mrs. Simpson met the Duke of Windsor?
You promised you would double-date with Larry's friend Mike.
- I am holding you to that promise.
- Blanche, I'm sick.
- Oh, you just have a cold.
-  See?
You just have a little tickle in your throat.
- All right, come on!
Let's go!
- Blanche, please!
Please!
My body aches.
So does mine, honey.
That's why I wanna go out on this date.
Blanche, I am miserable!
It is mind over matter.
Now, you can do it.
You can get up.
You feel better already.
You're not sick anymore.
You can heal yourself!
Walk, Dorothy!
Walk!
Just because you put your makeup on with a butter knife doesn't make you Tammy Bakker.
Oh, forget it, Blanche.
I'm not gonna kill myself because you have the hots for some guy in a fancy car.
Dorothy, Larry is very important to me.
You picked him up at a gas station.
He must've been impressed with your spare tire.
- I cannot believe you are doing this.
- I can't believe you are so selfish.
Pussycat, drink this.
It'll make you feel better.
Oh, Ma, another hot toddy?
I think I've had enough.
Shut up and drink.
This is the fourth one.
That's a lot of whiskey.
I only put whiskey in the first one.
We ran out.
Oh.
The second and third were vodka.
No wonder my head is spinning.
This one's part Amaretto, part Sambuca.
That should kill everything.
Killed your father.
Dorothy?
Dorothy!
She's out cold.
The fever takes a lot out of you.
Sophia, help me get her into the bedroom.
She's comfortable here.
Oh, all right.
I'll just prop her up a little.
Mike's not that particular.
He just got out of prison.
It was absolutely dreadful.
I spent the evening going in and out of consciousness while a guy with a silver tooth and a scorpion tattoo on his arm tried to grope me through the Vicks VapoRub.
Oh, stop your complaining.
Mike was a very nice man.
He burned down a diner in Arkansas because his eggs were runny.
Blanche, you owe Dorothy an apology.
- Shut up, Rose.
- Don't you tell me to shut up.
- Okay, I will.
Shut up, Rose.
- You see the way they pick on me?
They're always telling me to shut up.
Why is that?
- Well, it could be - Every time I open my mouth, - Rose - they jump on me.
They say I babble.
I don't babble.
People who babble Shut up, Rose!
I mean I think things would be more productive if we conducted things in a more orderly fashion.
But you see what we put up with.
She's an airhead.
Oh, yeah?
Well, you're a barbell.
That's a dumbbell, you twit!
Ladies, ladies, please calm down.
Who can give us an example that will illustrate exactly what you're trying to say about Rose?
I've got the perfect example.
Dorothy was on vacation, looking for a part-time job, so she asks Rose to put her ad in the classifieds.
Well, that was a mistake to begin with right away.
- Rose, it is not here.
- Look again.
It has to be.
I have read every want ad in the paper.
Mine is not here.
Are you sure you dropped it at the newspaper?
You told me what you wanted me to do a dozen times.
Any idiot could've done it.
I know, but you were the only one going downtown.
Are you sure that you dropped it off at the newspaper office?
Yes.
Six people called while you were out.
Give that to me.
I'll try and find it for you.
- Dorothy?
- Have we met?
Not yet.
I'm here because of your ad in the paper: "Willing to do anything, $8.00 an hour, no job too big or small".
Of course.
Please come in.
I didn't expect people to actually come here.
I just figured that I would be going to them.
That's the way it'll work in the future when my video camera gets back from the shop.
What type of work is it that you need done, Mr - Toto.
- Mr. Toto.
Oh, no "Mister".
Just Toto.
You're Dorothy, and I'm Toto.
At least for the next $8.00.
Dorothy, you owe me an apology.
Your ad's right here.
Oh, Rose, this is the personals column.
- So what?
- So what?
You put an ad in the personals that said I will do anything for $8.00 an hour?
Look.
It's right under an ad that reads, "History professor seeking nonsmoking Oriental woman "who is into Wesson Oil and bears a resemblance to Florence Henderson".
- Is that signed "Doug"?
- Yes.
I know him.
He's a sick man.
Well, I'm terribly sorry for this mix-up.
Good-bye.
Oh, my God!
I don't believe this!
I'm going to call the cops if you don't get out of here, you pervert!
Hi, Father Rossi.
Here's the canned goods for the needy.
Oh, no.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
I promise I will say Hail Mary's until Madonna has a hit movie.
Hi.
Here's my $8.00.
Let's get started, Dorothy.
Oh, I'm not Dorothy.
She is.
I'll give $4.00.
Let's get started.
How would you like your rear end kicked across the street?
Great!
Here's the other $4.00!
Girls!
Girls!
There is a busload of Greek sailors out front.
They wanna know how many drachma there are in $8.00.
It didn't turn out well, but it was an honest mistake.
Besides, something good came out of it.
We learned to make souvlaki.
Rose, you do this kind of stupid thing all the time.
If you're not doing something stupid, you're wearing something stupid or cooking something stupid.
Rose, what do you think of Blanche saying these things?
I think she's a garconanokin.
What exactly does that mean?
Literally, it's the precise moment when dog doo turns white.
But in general, it refers to the kind of person you don't wanna share your hoogencoggles with.
Rose, if you say one more of those stupid words - Blow it out your tubenburbles!
-  If I have to live with her one more week Ladies!
Ladies, please!
We're not going to get anything more accomplished unless you sit down, take it easy and discuss this rationally using only English words.
Now, we talked about Rose.
We talked about Blanche.
Nobody has said a word about Dorothy.
They're afraid of her.
We are not.
But we do have a problem with her.
What specifically is it about Dorothy that is disruptive to the household?
It's nothing specific.
It's her entire general attitude.
Yeah, like that time a couple weeks ago, week before last.
-  - Come in.
Hi, Dorothy.
- Oh, hi, Rose.
- How's the studying going?
I have a lot to cover.
I'm gonna be up for a while.
- Okay.
I'll keep you company.
- I don't want any company.
Just pretend I'm not here.
Oh, goody.
A slumber party.
Mind if I join you?
What is the matter with you two?
Something's the matter?
Okay, I wanna see six hands above that blanket right now!
The only reason we're in bed with Dorothy is we're scared.
Scared?
Of what?
Dorothy, don't you laugh, but we're scared of the aliens.
How many times have I told you not to call them "the aliens"?
They are the Chungs, and they happen to be very nice.
They're not very nice.
They eat dogs.
Ma, they do not eat dogs.
Right.
It's just a coincidence that not one ever pees on their lawn.
Ma, you made that up.
Sophia, we're not talking about them anyway.
We're talking about aliens from space.
Oh, those aliens.
Get out, both of you!
Have a heart.
Rose and I rented that movie Aliens, and it just scared us half to death.
Scared me, too.
That Sigourney Weaver's a sweet girl, but she really shouldn't go without makeup.
I don't have time for this!
Now, I have my education exam tomorrow morning.
- You're kicking us out?
- Rose, I have to study.
That's my Dorothy.
Always with her nose in a book.
Unlike your brother Phil, who was with his nose in the dirty clothes hamper.
I cannot believe you would be so cold-blooded as to cast out your two dearest friends in this, their time of need.
I can't believe that the two of you are so inconsiderate you would disturb me with something ridiculous when you know how important my exam is.
- If I don't pass, I don't get my raise.
- That's it.
Everybody out.
Sophia, we're scared!
I'm scared we won't be able to afford meat on the table.
You wanna wind up swapping recipes with the Chungs?
Out!
Out!
- Ladies, I'm not sure I understand.
What I mean is Dorothy was perfectly reasonable.
She was more than patient.
Exactly.
And I've had it up to here with her.
It's not easy living with somebody who's always so together.
She's so efficient, so organized.
She even balances her checkbook.
Since when is competence a crime?
Look, Dorothy cannot be blamed for being capable.
She doesn't have to lord it over us and criticize us for not living up to her standards.
She's always harping on us to do everything just right.
I'm surprised she doesn't check our underwear before we leave the house.
Those of you who wear underwear.
Maybe I am a perfectionist and maybe I do take charge, but if I did not, our whole household would fall apart.
To tell you the truth, Doctor, I'm the glue that keeps these women together, and I am totally unappreciated.
Oh, Ma, please!
Look, you may be smart, but I'm wise.
When it comes to a real problem, I'm the one who has to set it straight.
Let me tell you a little story, Doctor.
Sophia, are you busy?
No.
Just drawing a line on the Milk of Magnesia bottle.
Why?
I think the gardener's been sneaking a few sips.
I have a problem.
All right.
Take a sip.
I'll draw another line.
No.
It's not that.
My boss at the center made a pass at me.
Maybe you misunderstood.
What did he do?
He called me in his office, threw me on the couch and kissed me.
That's a pass.
Okay, I think I can help you.
I'll tell you a story, Rose.
Picture it: Sicily, 1922.
Sophia, I have a problem.
I saw the guy I've been dating out with another woman.
- What do you think I oughta do?
- Sit down and picture Sicily, 1922.
It was the worst of times, it was the worst of times.
It was Sicily, 1922.
Oh, Ma, I have a problem.
Just sit down and listen.
First, is everyone who lives in this house here at this moment?
- Yes.
- Then for the last time, picture it: Sicily, 1922.
A beautiful young woman with breasts not unlike Brigitte Nielsen, except hers moved when she skipped, she comes walking down a picturesque country road when suddenly a yellow Rolls-Royce pulls up and blocks her path.
Oh!
Who was in the Rolls?
Robert Goulet, for all I know.
It's not important to the story.
Anyway, the Rolls-Royce moves on, and the girl finds her pepperoni is missing.
- What happened to it, Sophia?
- Bambi ate it.
How should I know?
You keep missing the point.
The thing is, she has no pepperoni to bring to her family's table.
She gets hysterical.
She starts to run.
She runs through the field, the meadow, over the hill until she comes to a raging river filled with pepperoni swimming upstream.
Ma, pepperoni swimming upstream?
I know it's odd.
Pepperoni is a land meat, but there it was.
She wades into the river, grabs an armful and races home to feed her family.
When she tells the story, they think it's an act of God.
But as it turned out, a disgruntled pepperoni stuffer had blown up the factory in a neighboring town, causing pepperoni to rain down over a hundred square miles, which is where the Sicilian saying "It's raining cats and pepperoni" comes from.
Is this helping anyone yet?
Because this sure feels like an ending to me.
It's helping me, Sophia.
What I got out of the story was that I should take a bad situation and make it better.
- I'm gonna tell my boss off.
- That's not what I got out of it.
You were trying to tell me to dump my boyfriend because there's lots of pepperoni in the sea.
- That's what I was trying to tell you.
- Thank you, Sophia.
Dorothy, did I help with your problem?
You sure did.
I didn't know what to have for dinner.
How about splitting a pepperoni pizza?
Sure.
You buying?
Does a pepperoni swim upstream?
Did once.
Let's go.
I'm afraid I don't understand, Sophia.
They look up to you.
They seek your advice.
They respect your opinion.
What exactly is your complaint?
That I don't get $150 an hour like you.
What do you think we should do?
In my experience, most domestic problems can usually be resolved through a willingness to cooperate and hard work.
You're saying if we become more tolerant of each other, we can work things out?
In your case, there's really no point.
You are totally incompatible.
What?
You are incompatible.
You bring out the worst traits in each other.
I'm surprised you were able to live together this long without killing each other.
But, Dr. Ashley, we came here for you to help us.
Ladies, I like you.
Save your money for the moving expenses.
Well, thank you, Doctor.
It was difficult to hear, but  you're probably right.
I knew you were a quack.
A legitimate shrink would've strung us along for months.
Well, then, I guess tomorrow morning we can start to pack, can't we?
Yeah, I guess so.
That's probably the best thing.
Uh, Dr. Ashley was right, wasn't he?
Oh, absolutely.
'Cause It doesn't mean we can't still be friends.
You know, we'll visit each other.
It's just that we can't live together.
Right?
What's going on?
We were just discussing going our separate ways.
- Interesting.
- You think that's what we should do?
- I didn't say that.
- You think we should stay together.
- I didn't say that either.
- What should we do?
It's not for me to say.
But I'll tell you a story.
Picture it: Miami, 1987.
A house, the only one in the neighborhood without a pool.
But I digress.
Four women, friends.
They laugh, they cry, they eat.
They love, they hate, they eat.
They dream, they hope, they eat.
Every time you turn around, they eat.
- Sophia, are those four women us?
- Look in the mirror, blubber-butt.
The point I'm trying to make is, what's going on here is living.
Just because you have some rough times doesn't mean you throw in the towel.
You go on living and eating.
I'll get the cheesecake.
- I'll get the whipped cream.
- I'll get the chocolate syrup.
I'll get the Polaroid.
This is a time to remember.
- Ma, you don't have a Polaroid.
- I'll get mine.
It's under my bed.
I have to go in there for the whipped cream anyway.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Thank you for being a friend  Traveled down the road and back again  Your heart is true  You're a pal and a confidant  And if you threw a party  Invited everyone you knew  You would see  The biggest gift would be from me  And the card attached would sat  Thank you for being a friend  Ma, if you didn't like the dress, you should have just told me.
I was trying to be helpful.
Asking if it came with a sign saying "Wide Load" is not being helpful.
I will never ever take you shopping with me again.
Fine, I'll shop at the mall by myself.
Then I'll be able to pee when I'm good and ready.
Dorothy, you found the dress for the banquet.
Oh, do you just adore it?
Does it stir emotions deep within you?
Could you just throw yourself down and die for it?
It's a dress, Blanche, it's not the Alamo.
It must be pretty special.
It took you five weeks to find it.
That's because I'm hard to fit.
I can see that, Dorothy, I'm not blind.
I didn't mean anything by that, honey.
Actually, I tend to fall between sizes myself.
Usually, I'm smack dab between a four And a 16.
- Hi, girls.
-  Hi, Rose.
Oh, Dorothy, is that your dress for the museum fundraiser?
- Uh-huh.
- Well, let's see it.
Oh, all right, but I warn you, it is very simple.
Well, what do you think?
I think you're my best friend, so let's change the subject.
I think it's beautiful.
Exactly what I would have picked.
That settles it.
It goes back tomorrow.
What are you wearing, Blanche?
I'll probably grab some dazzling little number from my closet, that these people have not been privileged to see.
Maybe the red, sequined, strapless, backless, low-cut mini.
Why don't you just tie a scarf around your waist?
Oh, Ma, good news.
They changed the flavor of Haley's MO.
- I'm taking the dress back.
- So?
So I'm sorry I lost my temper before.
And Ma, I really would like you to go with me and help me pick out a dress.
What do you say?
What do I say?
I'm your mother, Dorothy.
I was there for you when you needed a communion dress.
I was there when you needed a prom dress.
I was there when you needed a wedding dress.
And frankly, I'm sick of it.
Buy your own damn dress.
I'll be over at Mildred's.
Rose Nylund?
No, if I start acting like her, pull the plug.
Rose Nylund.
Forty-three years and I'd know you anywhere.
Are you You're not Could you Buddy Rourke.
- Buddy Rourke!
- Yeah.
Oh, Blanche, Dorothy, it's Buddy Rourke.
Oh, come on in.
Buddy, these are my two best friends, Dorothy and Blanche.
- How do you do?
- Hi, there.
Buddy Rourke, after all these years.
You don't know who he is, do you, Rose?
Haven't a clue.
Please, don't be embarrassed.
We never met before.
Then how exactly would you have known her anywhere?
Charlie never stopped talking about her.
- You knew Charlie?
- Yeah.
- Please, sit down.
- I served with your husband in the war.
Fort Bragg to Nottingham to Normandy and back, thank the Lord.
Charlie Nylund was one of the finest men I ever met.
I often wonder why he put up with a wise guy like me, from the backstreets of Boston.
I'm sorry I didn't know who you were, but Charlie didn't talk about the war.
I always hoped Charlie and I would hook up again one day.
But, uh, well, believe it or not, I never had the occasion to visit St. Olaf.
Really?
You mean, not even to change planes for St. Gustav?
Oh, you can't get to St. Gustav by plane, Dorothy.
You have to go by toboggan.
Course, traveling in the summer is really rough on the old heinie.
It's a great way to rack up lots of frequent tobogganer mileage.
This is just amazing.
How did you ever find Rose after all this time?
I got Rose's address from Charlie's army pension records.
And I realized a lifetime had passed and I never laid eyes on my old chum's favorite girl.
So, I made myself a promise.
If I was ever in the area, - I'd pay my respects.
- Would you stay for dinner?
I'm making sweet and sour smelt kabobs.
Smelt kabobs.
Oh, darn, I had them for lunch.
Me too.
They served them on the plane.
And I'm awfully tired after the trip, but I was hoping that, uh, you might let me invite you to lunch tomorrow.
- That is, if you're free.
- Oh, that'd be wonderful.
And if you have time, I'd like to show you around Miami.
- I'll pick you up around noon.
- Great.
Ladies, it's been a pleasure meeting you.
- Nice meeting you.
- Likewise.
Rose, you're every bit as lovely as the picture Charlie used to carry.
See you tomorrow.
- What a sweet man.
- Absolutely charming.
And he obviously idolized your Charlie.
And more importantly, he wasn't wearing a wedding ring.
Oh, Blanche, don't be silly.
I merely checked it out and I noticed him giving me the eye.
Blanche, have you ever met a man you didn't think was giving you the eye?
Once, in 1976.
But it was only two days later that Mr. President Jimmy Carter announced to the American people he had secretly lusted in his heart.
You can't be serious.
Charlie read you every one of my letters?
Selected passages.
He selfishly kept the more intimate sections to himself.
One, please.
I used to write him every Sunday, after church.
That way I'd have all the latest gossip around town.
No, he read me the gossip.
In fact, and I remember there was some kind of a scandal.
Uh, with a neighbor, I think.
Uh, the name was, uh, let's see.
Oh, thank you.
Phineas Wigley?
I can't believe you remember that.
Well, in all fairness, Phineas Wigley is a hard name to forget.
Oh, I know what you mean.
The Wigleys were a revered family.
Yeah, until the scandal.
Oh, it was just terrible.
The Navy came to town to take bids for a big submarine contract.
They said they wanted three submarines built for a million.
Well, Finneas said he could make 100 for half the money.
So, of course, he got the contract.
When the Navy came to check on the progress, six months later, they discovered there'd been a misunderstanding.
Finneas had made 100 hoagie heroes for $500,000.
He claimed the reason they were so expensive was he used all imported meats and cheeses.
You know, that story still tickles me.
Just as much as the first time Charlie told it to me.
It just amazes me, how much you know about my life with Charlie.
Rose I don't think you realize how very much you meant to him.
Or how very much you meant to me.
To you?
I don't understand.
I didn't have a wife or a sweetheart back home.
And when Charlie would read me your letters, I felt like Well, that someone cared.
And that meant a lot to me.
I spent a long time searching for someone exactly like Rose Nylund.
I never found her.
And now I know why.
There's no one exactly like Rose Nylund.
- Oh, Buddy.
- Charlie carried those letters in his jacket through the war.
I carried them in my heart for a lifetime.
And I think I fell in love with the woman who wrote them.
Dorothy, you gonna show me the dress or not?
-  Be right there.
- Get a move on.
If you hurry up, I can give you an honest unbiased opinion.
You'll still have time to return it before the mall closes tonight.
- Well, Ma, what do you think?
- Pussycat, - you look sensational.
- You really think so, Ma?
I really think so.
I've never seen you look so beautiful.
- Thanks, Ma.
- Who's the designer?
He deserves a Nobel Prize for miracles.
Why do I even ask you?
I'm your mother, I'm gonna tell you whether you ask me or not.
By the way, the sleeves are too long.
- I'll ask Rose to shorten them.
- If you can find her.
Ever since that guy hit town, she spends most of her time polishing his shillaly.
Ma, Rose and Buddy are just friends.
Sure, and Michael Jackson was born with that cleft in his chin.
Girls!
Just wait until you see the little number I picked up for the museum banquet.
Here I come!
- I don't believe it.
-  It can't be.
Don't panic.
Pick up one for Rose, you can go as the Pointer Sisters.
You were going to wear something out of your closet.
Well, I was.
But as it turned out, nothing fit me.
What did you expect, Blanche?
Last weekend, you ate so many pudding pops, you could have built the Eiffel Tower from the sticks.
That is not what I meant.
I meant everything just hangs on me.
Of course.
That's why you have to cover it with a dress.
All right, Dorothy, what are we gonna do about this?
We are not going to do anything.
Blanche, it has taken me a whole month to find this dress, you are simply going to have to take yours back.
Dorothy, be reasonable.
This dress looks so much better on me than it does on you.
Hi, girls.
I love your dress.
- I am not taking mine back.
- I am not taking mine back.
Girls, I really need to talk to you.
This is crazy.
Since when do you care how you look?
I think it started when I came down from the bell tower and had my hump fixed.
Buddy's going back to Boston on Saturday.
This dress looks sensational on me.
People expect to see me in a sensational dress.
What do they expect to see me in, a yarmulke and a Hefty bag?
He wants me to go with him.
To live with him.
And I think I might.
Rose, honey, you can't be serious.
-  Why not?
- You hardly know the man.
I feel like I've known him all my life.
I talk to him about Charlie, I talk to him about St. Olaf, I talk to him about my family, my animal friends, I talk to him about life on the farm If that man didn't get a medal in the war, he deserves one now.
Wait a minute!
Did she just say "live with him"?
That's right, Sophia.
Not marry him, live with him.
Yes.
Two World Wars, a Polish pope and now this.
I may live to see CBS come up with a morning show yet.
I just don't know what to do.
Well, frankly, Rose, I think you're just rushing things.
But, I don't know.
Maybe it's better to live with Buddy than to just charge full steam ahead and marry him.
No, it isn't.
This is morally wrong.
It is epically offensive.
It's an out and out sin.
Why do I feel like I just fell through the looking glass?
Blanche, how can you, of all people, say something like that?
Well, Rose Nylund, I have never lived with a man without the benefit of marriage.
Excuse me, Blanche, I think what you mean is you have never lived with a man without benefit of room service.
Being with a man is not the same thing as living with a man.
You're right, Blanche.
Living with a man eliminates the need for an overnight bag and a stop at the drugstore.
And the need for marriage.
Family and tradition.
Not to mention wedding showers, catered affairs, the bridal registry at Burdines.
Well, I know what you mean, Blanche, but there's another side to this.
If I had lived with Stan before we got married I could have spared us both some very painful times.
And a bitter divorce.
And possibly given birth to reasonably attractive children.
It does seem like the right thing to do.
I'm comfortable with Buddy.
Everything seems so natural.
It's easier being with him because he already knows - so much about me.
- Yeah, but Rose, - do you love him?
- I think so.
- What about money?
- Everyone loves money.
Oh, I mean, have you talked about financial arrangements?
If you were married, you could have a prenuptial agreement.
But just living together, all you can do is steal money out of his wallet while he's in the shower.
We've agreed to keep our finances separate.
- He insisted on it.
- That's good, at least.
He suggested that since we'll need a bigger place to live, I should give him my half of the money now before I get there.
So that it'll be our place, not his, right from the start.
Sounds like you've made up your mind.
I guess I have.
Oh, but I feel awful about leaving you guys.
I feel like I'm breaking up the Three Musketeers.
Honey, you go with your heart.
We just want you to be happy.
I am happy.
And I want you to be happy.
That's why I want you to settle this dress business.
Oh!
There is nothing to settle.
Now, I am wearing this dress.
Dorothy!
It deserves to be displayed on a devastatingly beautiful body.
Who are you gonna send it to, Kim Basinger?
What is that supposed to mean?
Why don't you think about it while inhaling your next cheese cake.
How dare she imply that I overeat.
Makes me so mad!
Oh, darn.
We're out of Chips Ahoy.
I'm gonna get out of this girdle and go down to the market for some cookies and bean dip.
Oh, hell, I'll just take the damn thing off in the car.
Oh, Blanche, I'm glad you're here.
I have something to tell you.
- What are you holding?
- A new gown.
Oh, no!
I wanted to be the nice one.
I bought a new dress too.
Mr. Marty's?
On Market Street?
Where every dress is a guaranteed one of a kind original?
If we have the same dress, Mr. Marty's gonna be left with one of a kind.
Oh, thank goodness!
Everything's all right.
Except for what I have to tell you.
It wasn't about the dress?
It was about Rose and Buddy.
That business of giving him money has been bothering me.
So I've decided to do some checking on Buddy Rourke.
And after a couple of phone calls I found out he had just retired after 45 years in the records department of the Army Pension Office.
I don't get it.
That's how he knew about Charlie.
They never served together.
He just read his file.
But he knew all those things about Rose.
He knew that she came from St. Olaf.
I mean, everything else, Rose probably volunteered.
You know her, a stranger says hello, and suddenly he's hearing the life story of Uncle Fingerbinger and his 30-pound rutabaga.
Then this is all just a scam to bilk Rose out of some money?
Absolutely, and it is not the first time he's tried it.
Where is Rose?
I mean, we have to tell her.
Dorothy, she said she had to go to the bank and then go to meet Buddy.
What are we gonna do?
There's nothing we can do.
Wait until she gets home.
- Oh, good Lord.
-  Hey, girls.
How do you like this spiffy little number I picked up?
Sophia, that's the same dress I got.
Well, now you know how it should look.
I wrote the kids about you.
-  Really?
- Oh, not about us.
About you.
About how you knew their father.
- They found it unbelievable.
- What do you mean?
Well, that you and I finally met.
Oh, I thought you meant they wouldn't believe there were any dinosaurs still around - from World War II.
- Speaking of dinosaurs, did Charlie ever tell you about how they found the dinosaur bones right outside St. Olaf?
- Rose - Karl Nickerson was teaching his German shepherd to bury a herring bone.
- Karl was - Rose!
You haven't even mentioned about moving to Boston.
Are you avoiding the subject?
- I can't go with you, Buddy.
- But, Rose It wouldn't be fair.
I've given it a lot of thought and I realize, I'm not being honest with you.
- Or with myself.
- Rose, how could this be?
- We've been so happy.
- Oh, I am happy.
Happy with the memories of Charlie that you rekindled.
Oh!
Sometimes I put those memories too far away because I'm afraid they'll be painful.
It's the hardest on holidays or when I'm lying in bed, alone at night.
But remembering Charlie with you is wonderful.
I'm glad I met you, Buddy.
But I don't love you.
I I'm sorry.
Listen, I went to the bank and I got something for you.
- It's a gold watch.
- It's Charlie's gold watch.
I want you to have it.
But this is a very expensive piece of jewelry.
Please, Buddy.
I think I've taken enough from you and Charlie already.
- What?
- Listen, I hate emotional scenes.
I'm the only Irishman in Boston who avoids wakes and political rallies.
So, I'm just gonna run, you understand?
- But Buddy - I'll write.
I will.
No, I won't.
I always say that.
I never do.
You take care of yourself, Rose.
You're a special lady.
Ma?
- Ma, I need to talk to someone.
- Sure, come in.
I can hear Pavarotti live from the Met anytime.
What's the problem?
Ma, I'm upset about Rose.
Me too.
I thought I was finally gonna get a room with some sunlight.
I'm upset because we haven't told her the truth about Buddy.
Everything turned out all right.
She gave him the brush off, she didn't give him any money, - he didn't even take the watch.
- I know.
But we're letting her live with a lie.
So, a little lie gave her a lot of pleasure.
- What harm does that do?
- Oh, I don't know.
- Then what's the problem?
- It doesn't seem right.
Dorothy, let me tell you a story.
Picture it.
Sicily, 1922.
A young military officer stationed far from home.
He wanders the streets seeking a friendly face and a glass of Chianti.
Finally, he happens into a dusty little cafe where he finds both.
The man laughs for the first time in months.
And finds inspiration in a beautiful peasant girl, wise beyond her years.
When the cafe is closed, she takes him home with her.
Three glorious days, they make love and drink wine.
He returns to his command prepared to lead his people through whatever battles need to be fought.
Dorothy, that young peasant girl was me.
And that young man was Winston Churchill.
Ma, you made that whole thing up, now what is your point?
That I made it up.
It was a little lie that gave me a lot of pleasure.
If Rose is happy, and there was no harm done, let her have that.
You know something, Ma You may be right.
Good night, Charlie.
I love you.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Thank you for being a friend  Traveled down the road and back again  Your heart is true  You're a pal and a confidante  And if you threw a party  Invited everyone you knew  You would see The biggest gift would be from me  And the card attached would say  Thank you for being a friend  Well, hi, Ma.
How was bingo?
Judge for yourself.
Ma, you don't have any clothes on.
Tell me about it.
I just walked ten blocks.
I got a belly button full of tweed.
Ma, what the hell happened?
In the middle of bingo, Murray Hazeltine sits down.
He's the big practical joker at the center.
Believe me, Howie Mandel is funnier.
Anyway, he tells me to sniff his carnation for good luck.
- I take one whiff, and bingo.
- He squirted your dress with ink.
Actually, it was Del Monte prune juice.
It's free at the center.
It's a come-on.
They make their real money on the powdered toilet seat rentals.
What happened to your clothes?
Murray took them to have them cleaned.
I still can't believe it happened.
I've never been so humiliated.
There's no reason for you to be embarrassed.
He plays tricks on everybody.
I'm talking about on my way home.
My belt came loose in front of a construction site.
Nobody whistled, and two guys went home sick.
- Hi, girls.
- Oh, hi, Rose.
Sophia, what are you doing with that heavy coat on inside the house?
- You tell me, Rose.
- Ma!
Dorothy, was Sophia naked just now, or does her dress really need ironing?
Hello, girls.
Dorothy, Rose, you remember Laszlo.
Of course.
Laszlo, the artist from your museum.
Oh, we really enjoyed your lecture on modern sculpture.
I didn't think anyone was paying attention.
Oh, we sure were.
Especially Dorothy.
She talked about taking up sculpting.
- Really?
- Oh, no, I didn't.
Yes, you did.
You said you'd like to help him mold his clay or buff his marble anytime.
Rose, you're such a kidder.
Won't you sit down.
He is gorgeous, isn't he, girls?
There's not a woman at the museum who hasn't been after him.
Women can be so silly.
They think because you're an artist, you must be a great lover.
Because you're a master in the studio, you must be a master in the bedroom.
They think because you can work a piece of clay into a piece of beautiful art, you can also work a woman's body into fits of ecstasy and passion and total screaming abandon.
Would anybody else like something cold to drink?
- I would.
- I would.
Blanche, I really should be going.
Thank you again for the ride home.
It was my pleasure.
Good-bye, Blanche.
Good-bye, Dorothy.
Good-bye, Rose.
Good-bye, Blanche again.
It was my pleasure, ladies.
Good-bye.
Laszlo, I'll see you tomorrow.
Indeed.
That sure sounded as if you and Laszlo have something going.
Maybe.
You're not telling us?
All right.
All right.
You twisted my arm.
Girls, Laszlo's asked me to pose for one of his sculptures.
- You're kidding.
- No, I'm not.
Look here.
He gave me the key to his building.
I have my first session tomorrow.
Wow!
He's always wanted to do a piece on the mature woman, and he thinks I'm perfect for it.
And the best part is, he's gonna have it displayed at his big show.
I can't believe you're actually going through with this.
Of course I am, Rose.
Laszlo is a world-famous sculptor.
This is my opportunity to be immortalized forever in a classic work of art.
That's what she said when that shoe salesman took Polaroids of her in the backseat of his Volare.
- Good morning, Ma.
- Good morning.
I poured you a glass of orange juice.
Thank you.
It was very nice of you.
Ma!
Is this a dribble glass?
Yeah.
It works better when all that pulp doesn't clog up the dribble hole.
Why did you do this?
Murray Hazeltine.
He won't quit with the practical jokes.
I'm gonna give him a taste of his own medicine.
Do I look like Murray Hazeltine?
A little around the eyebrows.
But that's not the point.
I've got to have the perfect gag before I spring it on him.
Aw, I'm sorry, pussycat.
No hard feelings?
Oh, okay, Ma.
No hard feelings.
-  - Ah!
You know, I could really get tired of this.
Good morning.
Dorothy, you're a mess.
I just spilled orange juice on myself.
Oh, really?
I didn't notice that.
Pour Blanche some orange juice, Ma.
I could use that.
I might be coming down with a cold.
Doesn't come as a surprise.
You've spent every afternoon this week standing stark naked in a cold, windy studio.
Oh, I didn't catch cold at Laszlo's studio, Dorothy.
Laszlo keeps me too warm for that.
Too warm and too tingly.
Too warm and too tingly and too hot.
Well, have some juice anyway, Blanche.
I'd feel better.
Not that we actually do anything.
In the studio.
Laszlo's been a perfect gentleman so far.
I just stand there in front of him in all my luscious nakedness, and somehow he manages to suppress the urge to throw me on the floor and ravage me.
If he throws you on the floor, you'll both end up in the apartment below.
Drink up, Blanche.
That must be him now.
I just have to get my jacket.
We're driving to the museum together.
Coming, Laszlo.
Hi, Laszlo.
Come in.
Blanche went to get her jacket.
Thank you, Rose.
We are so excited about what you two are doing.
- It's gonna turn out great.
- I wish I was so sure.
- What do you mean?
- I'm having second thoughts.
About what?
When I met Blanche, I thought she would be the perfect model.
You know, sexy, sassy, exciting.
But now I'm thinking there are other qualities I wish to capture.
- Like what?
- Innocence.
Wholesomeness.
Naiveté.
I see a woman with a fuller figure, wider hips, wider eyes.
Rose.
Laszlo.
Rose, I have to ask you something.
I know what it is.
You're gonna ask me to pose for you.
- No, I'm not.
- Oh.
Oh.
I'm so embarrassed.
That's it.
That's exactly the quality I want to capture.
Oh, take my key, Rose.
Come to my studio.
We will make a beautiful sculpture.
- What about Blanche?
- I will still see her.
She doesn't have to know about you.
- Tomorrow morning at 10:00?
- That seems so dishonest.
Blanche is a dear friend.
It would be a betrayal.
Here I am, Laszlo.
Did Rose keep you entertained?
Yes.
I find her charming.
Oh, Laszlo.
That's what I love about you.
You can tell a bald-faced lie and still sound sincere.
I forgot my compact.
I'll be back.
Give me that key.
Dorothy, I'm glad you're home.
I was upstairs poking around the attic.
Look what I found.
Your grandmother's antique kaleidoscope.
Here.
Take a look.
Ma, you must really think I'm stupid.
What, we don't have an attic?
I am not falling for this.
It's another one of your practical jokes.
If I look through that, I'll get charcoal around my eye.
All right, Dorothy.
Fine.
Why don't we call a truce with a nice piece of peanut brittle?
Come on, Ma.
The peanut brittle is an even older gag than the kaleidoscope.
I'll open the can, snakes will come out.
I am too smart for you.
I am not falling for more of your practical jokes.
Except for this whoopee cushion.
You will not believe what happened to me today.
I still do not believe it, and you won't believe it.
- What, Blanche?
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- Hi, Blanche.
- Oh, I am so mad.
Blanche, I can explain.
It's got nothing to do with you.
It's Laszlo.
I saw some of the sketches he's been doing of me.
He never lets me see them.
So today I found some.
They're horrible.
My hair's all big and frizzy.
The body's all droopy and saggy.
The woman in those sketches is a dog.
- Blanche.
- She's a clown.
- Blanche.
- She's just a hideous, wrinkled, old bag.
Blanche, the woman in those sketches is me.
I know she sounds like you, honey, but she's not.
Yes, she is.
Look.
I wanted to tell you about this all week, but I couldn't.
I've been posing for Laszlo, too.
Dear Lord, strike me dead right here and now if that man prefers Rose Nylund over me.
Blanche, you can't take it personally.
Laszlo just decided he wanted someone with more innocence.
With more cellulite is more like it.
- Take that back.
- I will not.
- Yes, you will.
- I will not.
Girls, what is going on here?
- Rose stabbing me in the back.
- I did not.
- She's been posing for Laszlo.
- He asked me to.
I don't know why.
He can go to Sea World to see a naked whale.
Or to your bathtub.
Oh.
Oh, that does it, missy.
All right, this means war.
We'll both keep going.
We'll see who he picks.
- It's gonna be me.
- It's gonna be me.
- Girls, I can settle this.
- Tell her who it's gonna be.
It's going to be me.
You, too?
He asked me last Thursday.
Well, I am stunned.
I'm relieved.
Relieved?
Sure.
The woman you saw in those horrible drawings must have been Dorothy.
This has got to be one of the worst days in my life.
Two of my best friends just stabbed me in the back.
Did you really expect us to turn Laszlo down?
You said yourself it was a chance to become "immortalized in a classic work of art".
Horse pucky.
You went for the same reason Rose went: To get your hands on my man.
What exactly makes you think he's your man?
- Who?
- Maybe that I found him first.
- Who?
- He dumped you for me.
Who?
- Laszlo, Ma.
- Who's Laszlo?
A Hungarian artist we've all been posing nude for.
In the future, a simple "none of your business, Sophia" will suffice.
Tell me honestly, Blanche.
Do you have reason to believe Laszlo might be interested in you?
Well, just the fact that on numerous occasions he has referred to me as his "greatest artistic inspiration ever, bar none".
- Me, too.
- Me, too.
Oh, let's face it, girls.
We have no idea which one of us Laszlo wants to use.
I think it's obvious, Dorothy.
The man is an artist.
He has taste.
He cannot help but pick the woman with the most grace, style, femininity  I wonder if he knows which one of us he wants.
He told me that I had something that Blanche didn't have.
He probably told Dorothy she had something that I don't.
- Maybe he's back to Blanche.
- I think he's been very unfair.
We ought to stop going.
Then he'd have no sculpture.
- It would serve him right.
- Yes.
Let's make a pact.
None of us will go back.
We'll seal it by you giving me your keys, and I'll keep all three of them safe in my hope chest.
How do we know that you and your hope chest won't keep going?
There's only one thing to do.
Go to Laszlo and make him decide who he wants.
- Fine with me.
- Fine with me, too.
Then let's go.
- Where's everybody going?
- We'll be back.
Ma, why don't you sit right over here and read your magazine, okay?
Oh.
Okay.
Don't try to outsmart me, Dorothy.
I got the mind of a fox and the butt muscles of Baryshnikov.
Coming.
Oh, Blanche.
Hello.
Come in.
Come in.
You've brought your friends to see my studio.
What a pleasant surprise.
Laszlo, we all know.
We figured it all out this afternoon.
So, I am caught at last.
What can I say?
"Blanche and Rose, get out.
Dorothy, it's you I want".
Dorothy.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I've never seen him in overalls before.
Laszlo, we came over for you to decide which one of us you want for your statue.
Rose I knew it.
It's me.
Walk, suckers.
He wants me.
Rose, he just wanted to say something to you.
I wanted to say that I would rather not decide at all.
But, Laszlo, you've got to.
It's the only way.
Otherwise, it'll just end up coming between the three of us.
Which one of us is it gonna be?
Dorothy here, or Rose, or a woman whose breasts you once described as "perfect champagne glass-sized orbs of dancing loveliness"?
Blanche, I did not say that.
Well, you agreed when I said it.
Ladies, let me explain.
I know I should have made my choice long ago, but you each inspired me so well.
I wish I could continue seeing you all, but I understand why that is unacceptable.
Therefore, my choice will have to be Before you make your choice, let me say what a privilege it has been to work with a man I consider to be the greatest Hungarian sculptor of our time.
And let me say if Blanche can name two other Hungarian sculptors of any time, I shall eat that statue.
What's it gonna be?
Who do you choose?
- None of you.
- None of us?
I have enough sketches of each of you to make my sculpture.
When I'm ready to begin, I will make my choice then.
When we will find out?
Only when the work is unveiled at my show.
Now, I apologize, but this is how I must work.
Now, ladies, I must bid you good day.
Laszlo, just one more thing.
You know that famous Picasso painting, "Nude Woman Playing the Violin"?
- But of course.
- Originally it was called "Blanche Playing the Violin".
Only it wasn't a violin.
Think about that the next time you're standing around with your chisel in your hand.
Oh!
Oh, my God, Dorothy.
There it is.
The statue.
Oh, this is so exciting.
I can't wait to hear that crowd gasp when they lift up the sheet and see me there.
I'd think you'd be used to that by now, Blanche.
Hi, girls.
Some party, isn't it?
What are you so cheerful about?
Why shouldn't I be?
For starters, any minute now, this entire room could be looking at a statue of your nude body.
Nude?
The statue's gonna be nude?
What did you think?
He'd put it in a rain poncho?
Oh, my God.
Hey, Dorothy, can you believe it?
Ten grand for this piece of junk.
Oh!
Oh, Ma!
You fell for it.
This stuff kills me.
Excuse me, ma'am.
You'll have to come with me.
You just smashed a priceless Lichtenfein.
- I must have mixed the two up.
- When are you gonna learn that you have to stop with these ridiculous practical jokes?
I can't believe it.
She fell for it again.
You ought to have "yutz" tattooed on your forehead.
Here you go.
You were brilliant, Harry.
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention, please?
This is the moment we've all been waiting for.
The unveiling of the latest masterpiece of Mr. Laszlo Gregorian.
So without further ado, off with the sheet.
Oh!
Oh!
My God, I look gorgeous.
You?
Blanche, that's me.
The hell it is.
Girls, be serious.
Look at those eyes.
- Look at the nose.
- Look at the butt.
- You can't see the butt.
- Then it sure can't be you.
- You.
- This is ridiculous.
There's only one way to settle this.
Where is Laszlo?
- There he is.
- Laszlo.
Let me be the first to tell you what a simply stunning piece of art this is.
- Thank you, Dorothy.
- Who the hell is it?
It's not obvious?
- Not to them.
- Not to them.
I see I must explain.
In this statue, I want a look of strength and character.
- So I chose Dorothy.
- I knew it.
- Then I dropped her.
- Like so many before you.
I decided I needed more sensuality and vitality.
So I turned to my sketches of Blanche.
- I knew it.
- Then I put them away.
I wanted more softness, more sweetness.
So I went to my sketches of Rose.
- You mean that's me up there?
- No.
- Then who is it?
- It is all of you.
The answer finally came to me.
Why not take the best features of each lady to create one perfect lady?
That is what you see.
It is not hard to understand why you are such good friends.
You complement each other very well indeed.
Oh!
Thank you, Laszlo.
One more thing, Laszlo.
I'd like to ask you a question.
By any chance, is there anybody here tonight in whom you might be interested romantically?
Well, as a matter of fact, yes.
I knew it!
It's me!
Oh, Laszlo.
Looks like we're a hit.
I'm sorry.
I thought you knew.
How can you blame him?
The man looked at the three of you naked for a month.
Morning, Ma.
You'll be glad to know my practical joking days are over.
Ma, that is wonderful.
So sit down and have a glass of juice.
Okay, I will.
You wouldn't be playing a joke with this glass, would you?
- Of course not.
- Of course not.
Because I know how much fun you have playing practical jokes.
I told you it's over.
Drink your juice.
Okay, Ma, I will.
Ma, did you leave something burning on the stove?
What?
I don't think so.
It was nothing.
Well, bottoms up.
Don't ever change, pussycat.

What a day.
What happened?
Butch and Sundance steal your seat on the bus?
I had a miserable day.
That manager docked me a half day's pay because I said hello to the customers.
You're not allowed to say hello?
Not at Pecos Pete's Chow Wagon.
You have to say howdy.
As a matter of fact, you say, "Howdy, partner?
How about a saddlebag of fries with that ranch house burger"?
I don't know why it doesn't trip naturally off my tongue.
Sophia, they took half your day's pay just for that?
This manager is a shark.
He's buckin' for supervisor.
He told Mildred and Edna they could only take ten-minute bathroom breaks.
Well, Ma, that's not unreasonable.
Please!
They're 85.
It takes Mildred ten minutes to roll down her stockings.
You'll never guess what I got in the mail.
If it's one of those adult toys from the back of a sleazy magazine, I'm not interested.
- I am.
Let me see it.
- Ma!
You wait your turn.
It's a postcard from my daughter, Rebecca.
Girls, can you believe it?
After almost four years, my baby's comin' to see me.
- I'm so happy I could cry.
- Blanche, you are crying.
Admit it, Rose.
You worked for Allied Intelligence during World War II.
- Huh?
- Fine.
Play it cagey.
When is she coming, Blanche?
She says in two weeks.
Look.
She signs it "Love, Rebecca".
I guess that means she's forgiven me.
- Forgiven you for what?
- It's difficult to talk about.
She wanted to leave school to become a fashion model.
You're daughter's a fashion model?
She's just beautiful.
Always has been.
Gorgeous blonde hair, sparklin' blue eyes, a figure men would mortgage a house for.
We were always so much alike.
And so close, just like Siamese twins.
It's a shame when they separated you, you got both butts.
Yes.
Anyway, we had a terrible fight about her quittin' school.
She told me to stay out of her life.
She swore she would never speak to me and hasn't.
That sounds like it's in the past.
I hope so.
I have missed her.
She's always been my favorite.
It sure makes me appreciate the special relationship I have with my daughter.
- Pussycat?
- Yes, Ma?
Dial your sister.
I never remember the area code.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Right.
6:00 at Mildred's.
We're putting together a list of demands to present to that scuzzball, McCracken.
Good.
Oh, and, Edna, bring some sherry.
Nobody bought that glaucoma story when you whipped out that reefer last time.
No.
No, you can't put it in brownies.
I said no reefers.
Okay?
Good-bye.
The problems you're having remind me of something that happened in St. Olaf.
Dust reminds you of something in St. Olaf.
I got work to do.
- I moved your things into my room.
- Why did you do that?
Blanche's daughter.
You're gonna have to sleep with me.
Let me respond to that the way your dates do.
"No, thanks.
I'll call you sometime".
- Okay, girls, how do I look?
- Oh, Blanche, you look beautiful.
But do I look like a mother?
Are you kidding?
From the side, you look like you're about to drop twins.
Blanche, relax, honey.
You look lovely.
I'm so nervous about seeing Becky after such a long time.
- I want everything to be perfect.
- It will be.
I don't know what to say to her.
Johnny Carson had that same problem the other night with F. Murray Abraham.
Good Lord, that's her.
My beautiful baby girl.
Oh, gosh.
I can't do this.
I'm not ready.
Blanche, come back.
- I need more time.
- It's been four years.
I need five more minutes.
I need four years and five minutes.
-  - All right, all right.
I'm coming.
Hi.
You're Blanche's daughter, the model?
What did she model, car covers?
You'll have to forgive my mother.
It's just that we didn't expect you to be this fat.
Becky, it's a pleasure meeting you.
- I'm Dorothy.
This is Rose.
-  Hi.
- This is my mother, Sophia.
- Nice to meet y'all.
Becky, what brings you to Miami?
My guess is, a small barge.
Why don't you see what's keeping Blanche?
Mama.
Rebecca.
Oh!
Honey.
Honey.
- Let me get a look at you.
- This could take several hours.
- Darlin', I have missed you so much.
- Oh, I missed you, too, Mama.
- Maybe we should leave them alone.
- No.
Don't you leave, girls.
I want my friends to share my happiness.
My enormous happiness.
Tell me all about Paris.
Where'd you live?
Where'd you work?
Where'd you find jeans that size?
- Sophia.
- That's okay.
I may have lost my figure, but I still have my sense of humor.
Does it bother you that I gained weight?
I'm just so glad to have you back again.
I'll show you where you'll be stayin' so we can unpack.
Now I understand why she's sleeping in Blanche's bed.
It supports the weight of an average female and two Venezuelan soccer players.
- Here we are.
- Oh, I love your home, Mama.
Thank you.
Well, honey, tell me.
How's your modeling career been goin'?
Well, to be honest, Mama, not too well lately.
- What have you been doin'?
- You mean besides eatin'?
- I didn't say that.
- That's what you meant.
Well, you have filled out a little bit.
But I don't want you to be upset, Becky.
We can fix it.
I'm gonna put you on a diet.
I don't want help.
I'm happy the way I am.
Happy?
Look at yourself.
How could you be happy?
You're not happy, Mama.
You're doin' it again.
You're tellin' me how to live.
- What do you mean?
- Nothing's ever enough for you.
I had to be the prettiest.
I had to be the most popular.
I had to be the brightest.
That didn't mean you had to run out and become the fattest.
Mama, you have to accept me for what I am.
You have to stop tryin' to run my life, otherwise I'm gonna have to leave again.
Now, honey Oh, you know, you're absolutely right.
I'm sorry.
Oh, hey, I love you just the way you are.
Every last pound of you.
Just exactly how many pounds is it I'm currently lovin'?
- Mama!
- Never mind.
Hi, Sophia.
How was your meeting?
Terrible.
That weasel of a manager wouldn't budge an inch.
He pushed us to the wall.
- Now it's war.
- What do you mean?
Tomorrow morning, all Chow Wagon employees over the age of 70 are officially out on strike.
- You're gonna picket the restaurant?
- No.
We're gonna put on war paint and shoot flaming arrows at the covered wagon out front.
Gee, that might even get you on the 6:00 news.
The table on the lanai's set.
Rebecca should be here with Jeremy.
Did Rebecca bring Jeremy to Miami to meet you?
- She didn't say.
I didn't wanna ask.
- You think he might be her boyfriend?
I didn't see any pictures of him when I went through her things.
Went through her things?
Why didn't you just ask?
Hey!
I don't stick my nose in where it doesn't belong.
-  - That must be them.
Hi, Mama.
This is Jeremy.
- Nice to meet you.
- A pleasure.
- Come in.
Sit down.
- Thank you.
You have a lovely home.
Thank you.
You seem like a nice young name.
He is a nice young man.
- Becky, was she talking to you?
- I'm sorry.
Hors d'oeuvres are now being served.
Meet my mother's friends.
This is Dorothy, Sophia, and Rose.
Nice to meet you.
Jeremy, where did you and Rebecca meet?
We met at a café in Paris.
There weren't any tables left, so I just sat at Becky.
Why don't we move out to the lanai for dinner.
- I'll show you the way.
- Let me help you.
- Thank you.
- Becky?
Oh.
Yeah.
Mmm.
That fettuccini was sensational.
You ladies made a great meal.
As long as you're handin' out compliments, you haven't said anything about my outfit.
That's not very nice.
I'm trying to be nice.
That's why I didn't say anything.
You all get comfortable and I'll make a pot of hot coffee.
Which I'd like to pour down his pants.
How can you let him talk to Becky that way?
Dorothy's right.
I haven't heard anyone insult someone like that since Lars Svensson accused Erik the Red of being a coward and called him yellow.
Wouldn't that make him Erik the Orange?
I'm not about to meddle in Becky's personal life.
I made that mistake once before.
Blanche, this is different.
He is downright cruel to her.
If Rebecca doesn't mind it, it is none of my business.
She's only known him a short time.
I'm sure she'll come to her senses before very long.
Ma, you don't have to help with the dishes.
- I couldn't listen to that anymore.
- You mean Jeremy's rude remarks.
I mean Rebecca talking about marrying that jerk.
Are you tellin' me Rebecca and Jeremy are plannin' to get married?
Yeah.
I overheard them talking.
Maybe you misunderstood.
Please.
Me misunderstand?
My bladder may be weak, my eyesight may be failing, my bones may be brittle I see your point.
Maybe you better double-check.
Rebecca, Jeremy, is there something you would like to tell me?
- As a matter of fact, yes.
- Please, Becky, let me do it.
Blanche, I'd like to ask for your daughter's hand in marriage.
I'd take the rest of her, but I've got a bad back.
Jeremy, be serious.
Mama, Jeremy's asked me to marry him and I've said yes.
You are happy for me, Mama?
Happy?
Happy.
Honey!
Happy isn't the word for it.
Oh!
- Well, we're off to the game.
- I didn't know you played baseball.
We're not gonna play.
We're gonna see a game.
Mama offered to drive us to see the Dodgers.
Jeremy's a big baseball fan.
Becky's a bigger one.
Becky's a bigger everything.
Not everything, Jeremy.
- Well, we don't wanna miss anything.
- I wanna buy Becky a Dodger cap, see how many people mistake her for Tommy Lasorda.
That's it.
That is it!
Now, calm down.
We'll bring you back a cap, too.
I can't take it anymore.
I've gotta say something.
I know how frustrating it is, but there's nothing we can do.
It's her daughter.
It's her choice.
It's like something back in St. Olaf.
Rose, stop.
When any one of us makes an observation, the first thing we hear is "Back in St. Olaf".
Did it occur to you we might be tired of "Back in St. Olaf," "Back in St. Olaf'?
Gee, no.
I never realized.
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, that's okay.
- Back in that town whose name - Rose!
We need the kitchen.
- What's going on?
- A showdown with McCracken.
Your boss is coming?
A week on strike has had its effect.
He wants to negotiate.
I insisted we do it on our turf.
-  - That's him.
Let him in.
I gotta prepare the table.
Excuse me.
- Why are you doing that, Sophia?
- It's a power move.
- Three of us against one.
- And I get to look down on him.
Ma, Mr. McCracken's here.
Ladies, let's get down to business.
I've got to get back for the lunch rush.
We'll just leave you to your negotiations.
Can we get you some milk or some Double Stuf Oreos?
- No, thank you, ma'am.
- Boy, he's tough.
Have a seat, boss.
I've read your list of demands.
Wait, McCracken.
Before you begin, I wanna tell you something.
I'm no novice when it comes to negotiations.
- Oh, really?
- Let me tell you a story.
Picture it: Sicily, 1922.
An attractive peasant girl, who has saved her lira, embarks on a glorious vacation to a Crimean resort on the Black Sea.
For weeks, she frolics at the seaside resort and enjoys the company of many young men, all of whom adore her.
All of them?
Shut up, Edna.
I work alone.
All of them.
When it's time to return to Sicily, three different suitors beg her to stay.
But she can't decide who to choose, so she chooses none of them.
But she agrees to meet with them at the same resort many years later.
To her trio of suitors, that eventful gathering was referred to as "Rendezvous With Sophia".
But to the rest of the world, it was better known as the Yalta Conference.
You expect me to buy that?
The only reason I came here was so you wouldn't cause a scene at the Chow Wagon when I fired you.
Fired us?
You heard me.
No story is gonna change my mind.
Not even the one we could tell your father about how his car got dented while you were doing wheelies and not while it was sitting in the parking lot?
You wouldn't do that.
Would you?
Hey.
She's your grandmother.
Has she ever lied to you?
Is Jeremy coming in a taxi or driving to the airport?
- He's takin' the car.
- Uh-huh.
Well, that's good.
- I guess this is it.
- Oh, I hate these moments.
I never did learn how to say good-bye.
Oh, there are so many ways to say farewell.
Auf Wiedersehen, arrivederci, adiós, hasta luego,,, Get lost.
See?
There's another one.
Good, Dorothy.
Oh.
- Didn't you hear me honking?
- We were saying good-bye.
Well, hop to it.
Kiss-kiss, hug-hug.
We're outta here.
Mama, thanks for being so understanding about our wedding.
That's me.
Old, understandin' Mama.
It's simpler if Jeremy and I run off and do it ourselves.
That'll be the day when you run anywhere.
Do you think you can be patient?
I know things move slow here at Sunnybrook Farm, but we have a plane to catch.
- The kitchen.
- What?
You heard me.
Into the kitchen right now!
Rebecca, I've held my tongue for two solid weeks, but I cannot any longer.
I am your mother, and I cannot let you go out that door without asking you why, of all the men on God's green Earth, have you decided to marry that lump of nothin'?
Because I want a husband, a family, and Jeremy may be my last chance.
- That's just nonsense.
- Oh, Mama, look at me.
Open your eyes.
- I'm not beautiful.
I'm not a catch.
- For that man, you certainly are.
He's got you thinkin' that you need him.
He's the one who needs you.
You're the only woman on Earth who's kind and caring enough to give him a glance.
He's not good enough for you!
Do you hear what you're saying?
You're doing it again.
He's not good enough for you.
Neither am I. I never have been.
- I wish I'd never come here.
- Rebecca.
Becky Sue.
Let's go, Jeremy.
- Finally.
- Rebecca.
Rebe Wait!
Oh, damn!
It's not like Blanche to go to bed at 8:00.
At least not by herself.
Blanche is depressed, Rose.
Do you think she's depressed about Rebecca?
No, Rose.
She's depressed because Marblehead Manor is only on once a week.
Ah.
I remember when I was a little girl when we'd get depressed.
Grandma could always cheer us up.
She'd take out her dentures and she'd take a healthy swig from the aquarium, and then she'd put a flashlight under her chin and we could watch the goldfish swim from cheek to cheek.
We could've watched it all day.
But visiting hours were only from 10 to 4.
I couldn't sleep.
I just kept tossin' and turnin', thinkin' about the mistake I made.
- Blanche, you did the right thing.
- You're only sayin' that.
- Sophia, am I a bad mother?
- You did what you had to do.
Why do I feel so terrible?
Because it is not easy being a mother.
If it were easy, fathers would do it.
Why can't kids understand that we're tryin' to do what's best for 'em?
They're kids.
When they become mothers, they know better.
- Right, Dorothy?
- Right, Ma.
Gee, I remember you used to make me bring my dates into the house to meet you and Pop.
Boy, what an inconvenience.
Between the ages of 12 and 19, I met two guys.
I remember my mother making me practice the tuba.
Three hours a day, seven days a week, for ten years.
- I hated it.
But it finally paid off.
- I didn't know you played the tuba.
I don't.
I gave it up.
But I can blow 32 pounds of air into a tire in less than a minute.
-  - Who could that be at this hour?
I'll see.
- Hi, Mama.
- Rebecca, am I glad to see you.
I'm sorry about what I - No.
Don't apologize.
You were right.
- What?
I was thinkin' about what you said, how much courage it took.
That's when I realized how much you love me.
- Oh, baby.
- You were right about Jeremy, too.
I can do better.
Just took someone who loved me to point it out.
Let's go tell the girls the good news.
They're havin' cheesecake.
Cheesecake.
That sounds great.
Why don't we just go sit out on the lanai.
Good-bye, sugar.
Have a good trip and call me.
- Bye.
- Call me.
Ah-huh.
Hey, I thought we agreed we weren't gonna talk about the children.

What you cooking?
Lasagna, for a guy at the center.
Oh!
Is he cute?
Cute.
He's 84, doesn't have a hair on his head or a real tooth in his mouth, and his body's covered with liver spots.
To answer your question, he's adorable.
Look at the great costume I got for the masquerade ball.
I can't decide whether to be the front end or the rear end.
I'm in a romantic mood.
I'm gonna let that golden opportunity pass right by.
- Hi, Dorothy.
- Oh, hello.
I got our costume for the ball at the counseling center.
Is it time for that again?
It's the biggest social event of the season.
- Dorothy, it'll be fun.
- It will not be fun.
There is no fun in my life.
Have you ever felt like you're stuck in a rut, going through the motions with no joy, pleasure or excitement?
Sure.
That was my sex life with your father.
Ma, my job is routine.
I have virtually no social life.
Nothing interests me.
My life has just become dull and boring.
Where's that sense of fun, that lighthearted laughter, that devil-may-care attitude?
Sophia, when was Dorothy ever like that?
Never.
I've been asking her these questions since she's 12.
You can't help it if you're dull and boring.
God did that to give the world some variety.
Otherwise, everybody would be just like me.
And there wouldn't be enough sailors to go around.
Your life doesn't have to be dull.
It's up to you to make it interesting.
Oh, I know.
You're right.
Get off your duff and do something.
There's a lecture at the school tonight.
Barbara Thorndyke is going to speak.
Who's Barbara Thorndyke?
A local novelist whose stories are all set in Florida.
Wait a second.
Barbara Thorndyke.
Didn't she write Evil Wind Over Pensacola?
- You know it?
- I go to bed with it every night.
- What's it about?
- How should I know?
My mattress frame lost a caster.
I use it to keep the bed level.
- Hi, Dorothy.
- Hi, Blanche.
Are we expecting company?
Yep.
Barbara Thorndyke.
I introduced myself after the lecture.
We went out and had coffee and talked for hours.
What you talk about?
Art, literature, world events, life.
I haven't had that stimulating a conversation in years.
If you're saying you can't get stimulating conversation around this house, I beg to differ.
I can't believe it.
It says since Michael Jackson can't buy the Elephant Man, he's put in a bid for the remains of the Big Bopper.
You can't believe everything you read in that rag.
It caters to people of the lowest intelligence.
Then why do you buy it?
Because it's the only newspaper Elvis will talk to from beyond the grave.
- I'm sorry.
Where was I?
- It's not important.
Listen, Rose.
Let's put this away so that Barbara Thorndyke won't see it.
Barbara Thorndyke is coming here?
Wow.
I've never met a real author before.
I have.
I once stood in line two hours at a bookstore for Arnold Schwarzenegger's autograph.
When I think of great literary figures of our time, it's usually, uh, Faulkner, Fitzgerald, and Schwarzenegger.
Schwarzenegger.
Yeah.
- Did he sign your book?
- Yes.
But only after he refused to sign my thigh.
He was probably intimidated to see a thigh bigger than his.
Oh, hi, Ma.
Anybody want a lasagna?
I thought you made that for your friend.
He said he had lunch already.
I offered to go to his place and warm it up for supper.
He said no.
The key is to make a man think you're not interested in him.
Offering to make him dinner made you look too easy.
Please.
Black underwear and pasties couldn't make me look easy.
- Barbara, please, come in.
- Hello.
- Oh, hello.
- These are my friends.
That's Blanche Devereaux.
Rose Nylund.
How do you do?
Sit down.
Sit down.
Well, Barbara, Dorothy tells us you're an author.
No, I'm just a writer.
Malamud's an author.
I thought malamuds were chocolate cookies with marshmallows in the middle.
Those are mallomars, Rose.
Dorothy, I want you to have a copy of my latest novel.
Oh.
Scarlet Dawn at Boca Raton.
Read the inscription.
Oh.
"To Dorothy Zbornak, a new and fascinating friend".
Oh, thank you so much.
I'm really touched.
I'll get the coffee and let you get to know each other.
Barbara, that is a stunning brooch.
Wherever did you get it?
Oh.
I was in Morocco working on a novel, not to mention a dashing young Moroccan, Oh!
When I had a severe attack of writer's block.
My head was devoid of all ideas and thoughts.
That happens to me a lot.
Do you write?
No.
Why do you ask?
Go on, Barbara.
I went for a walk in a crowded marketplace.
A man came up behind me, put something in my hand, and said, "This is what you need".
That happened to me once in the produce section at the A&P.
Well, anyway, the man gave me the brooch, and since then, I've never had any problem writing.
This is my muse, my artistic inspiration, the embodiment of my creativity.
And you know what's even better?
It goes with anything.
It might be a little tricky with plaid.
I'd be careful if I were you.
You missed the point of my story.
Oh, really?
Run it by us again.
I think not.
So, um, you bowl?
I beg your pardon?
How's it going?
I've had the most delightful conversation with Rose and Madge.
- That's Blanche.
- Oh, of course.
However I just remembered a previous engagement.
I have to go.
Oh, that's too bad.
Well, at least let me walk you to your car.
What do you think?
There's something about her I don't like.
- Me, too.
- I find her hard to talk to.
- Me, too.
- She thinks I'm dumb.
Me, too.
Blanche, have you decided who you're gonna be at the ball?
Yes.
I'm going as Eve from the Garden of Eden.
All I'll need is a few strategically placed leaves.
- What about a snake?
- I already have a snake.
I'm going with Hank Crinland.
He's a whiplash attorney.
Dorothy, Rose and I are going to the movies.
You wanna go?
I can't tonight.
Barbara's taking me to the experimental theater downtown.
Somebody dragged me to a show there one time.
Three men paraded around the stage for five hours talking about God and eating graham crackers.
They wore masks, but other than that, they were totally naked.
You stayed through the whole evening?
Well, I would've left, but one of the actors looked so familiar to me.
But it was hard to tell since he had such a small part.
Dorothy, come with us.
You'll have a lot more fun.
Besides, that Barbara is so snooty.
How can you say that?
You hardly know her.
Why doesn't she include us in plans she makes with you?
Because you have different interests.
Is it too much to ask of my best friends that they respect my right to have different interests and people in my life?
- I guess not.
- Thank you.
And I promise we'll do something together real soon.
Okay?
Maybe she's right.
We didn't give Barbara much of a chance.
First impressions can be wrong.
You're right.
I remember when I was little back in St. Olaf.
There was this old lady who lived up the street.
She never smiled.
She always looked angry.
The kids said she'd kill anyone who even stepped on her property.
We called her Mean Old Lady Higgenlooper.
Yeah, kids can be pretty cruel.
No.
That was her name.
Mean Old Lady Higgenlooper.
She had it changed legally 'cause everybody called her that anyway.
Then how come your name isn't Big Dummy?
There were already three other people in town with that name.
But that's beside the point.
One day I got up the courage to go up to Mean Old Lady Higgenlooper and ask her why she always frowned.
Well, she had been born with no smiling muscles.
I pointed out that a frown is just a smile turned upside down.
So from then on, whenever I'd go by, she'd stand on her head and wave.
That is one of the stupidest stories I've ever heard.
Which proves my first impression of you was right.
Blanche, I have an idea.
Why don't we invite Barbara over for dinner and give her another chance?
Why not?
If it makes Dorothy happy.
Let's go to the movies.
Rose, what was your first impression of me?
I thought you wore too much makeup and were a slut.
I was wrong.
You don't wear too much makeup.
And so Dorothy Parker turned to Alexander Woollcott and said, "If you laid all the women in this room end to end, I wouldn't be a bit surprised".
Very clever.
Very, very clever.
I can't remember hearing anything more clever.
Unless it was last week on Alf, when the cat next door I'll go get the after-dinner drinks.
Barbara, I picked up your first novel the other day.
Ah, yes.
So Dark the Waves on Biscayne Bay.
I've grown so much as a writer since then.
Well, I should hope so.
Blanche.
It's all right.
Did you have a problem with my book?
Yes, as a matter of fact, I did.
All those waves.
Big waves, little waves.
Dark waves rolling in.
Page after page.
I had to take a Dramamine to get through chapter three.
Blanche, the waves are a metaphor.
You see, a metaphor I know what a metaphor is, dear.
I'm not a dummy.
Blanche, what's a metaphor?
It's when you use a phrase to mean something else.
Like when I say, "Men are blinded by my beauty," they're not really blinded.
They get their sight back in a day or two.
Oh, Barbara, this is my mother, Sophia.
Ah.
Sophia, your daughter is one of the most beautiful people I've ever met.
Boy, you writers never stop using your imagination.
-  - Well, good-bye.
Where are you going?
It's Saturday night.
I'm all dressed up.
There's a car honking for me.
Think, Dorothy.
Remember something called "a date"?
Well, I'd better be going to.
But it's still so early.
I thought we could all have a game of oogle and floogle.
I don't believe I've ever heard of that.
We used to play it back in St. Olaf.
It's an adult version of hide-and-go-seek.
And how does it differ from the children's version?
Adults play it.
Of course.
I should have known.
I'll take a rain check.
It was so nice of you to come by.
I have an extra ticket for the writers symposium on Friday.
Would you like to come?
I'd love to, Barbara.
Thank you.
Anything for a friend.
Ciao.
Ciao.
And good-bye to you, too, Barbara.
Dorothy, the masquerade ball is Friday night.
You know how much it means to me.
I'm counting on you to be the rear end of my horse.
Rose, sweetheart, this Friday I can choose between rubbing elbows with Norman Mailer, or doing the hokey-pokey in a horse costume with your behind in my face.
Well, which is it gonna be?
Rose, honey, pass me the tuffy.
- With pleasure, Blanche.
- Thank you, Rose.
You're welcome, Blanche.
You can always count on me to hand you the tuffy.
I know.
That's why I always ask you.
I think I saw Jack and Janet give Chrissy this treatment on an episode of Three's Company.
Oh, at last, a reference from Dorothy that even we illiterates can understand.
I guess her well of knowledge has run dry.
That's a metaphor, Dorothy.
Why is it so important that I go to this masquerade ball?
Because it's so important to Rose.
She's crushed, torn up, devastated by your shocking insensitivity to her feelings.
- I don't feel that bad.
- Shut up, Rose.
I never said I was going.
Since when do we have to say we're going?
We've gone for the past five years.
We may hate it, but we always go.
You never told me you hated it.
I'm a good friend.
A good friend would never say anything like that.
I appreciate that.
Just admit that this is because you don't like Barbara.
All right.
I don't like Barbara.
I think she's a phony.
Oh.
This from a woman who tells her dates that she was Angie Dickinson's body double in Dressed to Kill.
That's just a little white lie.
Then why is it on your job resumé?
Blanche is right, Dorothy.
Barbara is not very nice.
She looks down on everybody except you.
- That's only 'cause you look up to her.
- That is ridiculous.
You don't notice how she uses her intelligence to make everybody else look stupid.
Like at supper when she asked us to pass the salt in Latin.
She cares more about words than she does about people.
You have a right to have your own friends, but it takes a good friend to point out your mistakes, and you're making one with Barbara.
How dare you make judgments like that.
And how dare you tell me who my friends should be.
Barbara, this place is incredible.
Yes.
It's the hangout for Miami's literary intelligentsia.
Ah, thank you.
Well, I've never seen a menu with a table of contents before.
Skip ahead to chapter five.
It's the lunch menu.
Oh, gee, everything sounds so good.
The Crepes of Wrath.
The Old Man and the Seafood Salad.
I think I will have the For Whom the Stuffed Bell Pepper Tolls.
I'll have a turkey sandwich on Catcher in the Rye bread with a side order of George Bernard Slaw.
Barbara, I've really come to value our friendship.
That's why I feel I can talk to you about something.
Feel free.
If I had a problem, I'd wanna confide in someone like me.
Ever since we became friends, there has been a great deal of tension between Blanche and Rose and me.
I didn't mean to infringe on your friendship.
No, no.
It's not your fault.
The problem is they feel left out of our friendship, and I don't know what to do about it.
Face it, Dorothy.
Blanche and Rose are limited.
Well, I admit I get tired of hearing about Blanche's dates and Rose's relatives back in St. Olaf, but they are very good friends.
If you like them, I must have overlooked something.
I have an idea.
Why don't I invite everybody and their dates for dinner at the Mortimer Club?
The Mortimer Club?
Barbara, that is the most exclusive club in town.
Here we are, ladies.
I didn't order the French fries.
Oh, right.
You get the Edgar Allan Poe-tatoes and the Ice Water Cometh.
You know, a little of that goes a very long way.
I'm having second thoughts about spending another evening with Barbara.
I don't think it'll hurt to give her another chance.
We're going to the Mortimer Club.
What's the big deal?
Rose, the wealthiest men in Florida go there.
It's been my experience that wealthy men make the best lovers.
Is that true?
No.
But if you tell them that, sometimes they'll take you to the mall and let you use their credit card for 45 minutes.
Blanche, honey, I hope you don't mind.
I borrowed your rhinestone necklace.
No, but I should point out it was designed for a dainty neck.
Yes, Blanche, but I don't know Mike Tyson well enough to borrow his jewelry.
Hello, Madge.
That's Blanche.
Oh, didn't I say that?
This is my date, Norman.
He's a student in my creative writing course.
I didn't know you taught high school.
Norman and I are the same age spiritually.
Hey, if you can get him to buy that, more power to you.
Hello, Barbara.
Hi, Dorothy, Rose.
I certainly hope tonight will help us forget what happened the other night.
I already forgot what happened the other night.
But I'm 82 years old.
This morning I forgot my cat's been dead for 20 years.
Which makes me wonder: Who's using the kitty litter?
Hello.
Come in.
Oh, Murray, what a snazzy tux.
I better not let you out of my sight tonight.
That's my daughter Dorothy.
These are her friends.
Everybody, I'd like you to meet Murray Guttman.
How do you do?
Murray, such a pleasure to meet you.
Nice to meet you, too.
Dorothy, could I see you in the kitchen for a second?
We have a little problem.
- We do?
- Yes.
Murray Guttman?
Oh.
Maybe we can get him to turn his jacket inside out.
I'm sure the lining isn't as loud.
His tuxedo has nothing to do with it.
I don't understand.
He can't come to the club.
- Why not?
- Guttman.
What are you talking about?
Guttman.
He's Jewish, isn't he?
I don't know.
What difference does it make?
Oh, a big difference.
The Mortimer Club is restricted.
Why are you a member of a club like that?
Because they serve a great breakfast and the parking is free.
Besides, it's their policy, not mine.
- Yeah, but you tolerate it.
- Dorothy, I tolerate a lot of things.
For instance, I'm tolerating this evening with Rose and Blanche because of my friendship with you.
I can't believe I'm hearing this.
Let's not make a big thing out of this.
We can't go to the Mortimer Club.
We'll go to another restaurant.
Boy, did I misjudge you.
Blanche and Rose were right.
You are not the kind of person I want as a friend.
Go to the Mortimer Club by yourself.
- I don't understand.
- Let me spell it out for you.
Go to hell.
Hmm?
Dorothy, what happened?
Barbara just stormed out of here.
She's not coming back.
Both of you were right about her.
I can't believe that I couldn't see it.
Can you ever forgive me?
What do you think?
Should we give her another chance?
We better.
Best friends are hard to come by.
Does this mean you'll go to the masquerade ball?
Yes.
And I'll tell you something.
After all the practice I have had lately, I'd be honored to be the horse's behind.
Oh, oh, oh, oh!
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Thank you for being a friend  Traveled down the road and back again  Your heart is true  You're a pal and a confidant  And if you threw a party  Invited everyone you knew  You would see  The biggest gift would be from me  And the card attached would say  Thank you for being a friend   Hi, Ma.
You want some dinner?
Forget dinner.
Listen up, everybody.
I've got something in this old lady purse that's gonna make you scream, holler and jump for joy.
Are the batteries included?
Hang on to your cannolis, because the four of us are gonna be contestants on Grab That Dough.
Grab That Do Ma, do you mean that ridiculous game show where people humiliate themselves - for the sake of a dollar?
- That's the one.
- I don't believe it.
- We're gonna be on TV.
I've been trying to get us on for six months.
Oh, Grab That Dough is my favorite game show.
Oh, mine too, and I think Guy Corbin is the cutest host on TV.
He's like Gene Rayburn, Chuck Woolery and Bob Eubanks, all rolled into one.
That's an awful lot of teeth and polyester.
- Sophia, when are we gonna be on?
- Tomorrow afternoon in Hollywood.
You're kidding, Hollywood, California?
No, Rose, Hollywood on the planet Romulak.
Wait a minute, Ma.
What do you mean, tomorrow?
That's what it says on these tickets.
Honey, they have to give us more time than that.
Oh, Ma, these tickets were sent out four months ago.
You gave them the wrong address.
Oh, yeah.
Here it is, my old address from Sicily.
Two miles west of Palermo, underneath the old bridge.
You used to live under a bridge?
Yeah, we were wealthy.
Most people didn't have a bridge to live under.
Well, isn't that a shame.
- We won't be able to go.
- Why not?
You have a pressing engagement with a cheesecake?
There's money involved here.
You know what, girls?
She's right.
Now, we could catch the red eye.
We could be in Hollywood tomorrow morning.
By tomorrow afternoon, we would all be ready to  Grab that dough!
I can't believe that stupid airline lost our luggage.
What are we gonna do?
Ask Blanche, she's the expert when it comes to checking into hotels without luggage.
I can't believe somebody stole my bags.
Don't worry about it.
With all the money we're gonna win, you'll replace those bags and everything in them.
- Yeah, what about my bags?
- Relax, with your share, you can have your bags surgically removed.
Let's get to our rooms and get some sleep.
- Good idea.
- Good morning, I'm Nancy.
- How may I help you?
- We have two double rooms reserved under the name Zbornak.
I'm afraid I just gave those two rooms away.
- But we had a reservation.
- Until 3am.
You're late.
Therefore the reservation is null and void.
I'm sorry, that's company policy.
Oh, yeah?
Well, I'm from Sicily and you know what our policy is?
- First, I break your knees.
- Ma, Ma.
Look, forget about the reservation, just give us two double rooms.
I'm afraid we're all booked up.
First you give away our rooms.
Now you tell us you're booked up.
- That's correct, madam.
- It is?
Hey, I'm pretty sharp for three in the morning.
Here, let me handle this.
Nancy, honey.
Now, I don't generally like to throw my name around, but you really leave me no choice.
It so happens that I am Miss Angie Dickinson.
And now, if you don't mind, I would like two rooms.
You don't look like Angie Dickinson to me.
I know, I have altered my appearance for a very important movie role.
Yeah, it's about a woman who eats her way from behind the Iron Curtain.
I think we just better go to another hotel.
I'm afraid that would be an exercise in futility.
There's not a vacant room in the city.
Girls, this is terrible.
We're gonna be on national television in seven hours.
We don't have any clothes, now we don't have a place to sleep.
Look, I sympathize with your problem.
For $ 75 you can sleep in the lobby and I won't have you arrested for loitering.
$ 75?
That's a lot of money.
I know, ma'am.
That's why I want it.
Oh!
Gee, this is just great.
I mean, everything this whole night has been nothing but fun.
You really need to get out more, Rose.
Come on, Dorothy.
Admit you're having fun.
It's kind of like being on an adventure.
An adventure, my foot!
It's more like a nightmare.
We're gonna go on national TV in clothes we slept in all night.
We'll look like hell.
We'll be exhausted, we won't be able to answer any questions.
Would you stop complaining?
We've got it easy.
Back in Sicily, I was on a game show.
It was torture.
- What was it called, Sophia?
- I just told you.
Torture.
Mussolini asked the questions and you'd better have the right answers.
Things like: Who do you like better, me or Hitler?
Who's got the snappiest boots, me or Hitler?
Who's got the cuter girlfriend, me or Hitler?
And you always had to answer, "Mussolini".
Otherwise, they forced you to play the lightning round.
They used real lightning.
Oh, come on, Ma, you're making this up.
Like hell, I did.
Goodson-Todman brought it to the U.S., changed a few rules and called it Tattle Tales.
Now count your blessings and go to sleep.
Good night.
Fernando, you naughty boy.
Not the feathers.
Blanche, Blanche, wake up.
People are looking at you.
What?
Oh.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I think I was having an erotic dream.
Your father used to do a thing with feathers when we were first married.
He was too lazy to pull them off the chicken so I put an end to that.
Ma, next time you have an urge to stroll down memory lane, do me a favor: Go by yourself.
What time are we supposed to be at the studio?
I don't know, I have to check the tickets.
Hand me my purse, Dorothy.
I don't have your pur Wait a minute, you have mine.
- I gave them to you.
- Hold everything.
- I think my purse is missing.
- So is mine!
Girls, you know what this means?
Somebody snuck in here while we were asleep and  Grabbed our dough!
I'm sorry ladies, but without a description, there's absolutely nothing we can do.
But if you remember anything, give me a call.
How about if I just wanna say hello?
Dorothy, I'm in the ladies room, I look in my brassiere, what do you think I find?
Hopefully, what we all find when we look in our brassieres.
I haven't been able to find those since I nursed your brother Phil.
But I did find the tickets to the game show.
-  Sophia!
-  You're kidding!
I forgot, I put them there for safekeeping.
Oh, Ma, I could just kiss you.
Uh, not until we locate a toothbrush, okay?
Well, it is high time something went right on this trip.
Yeah, we have to figure out a way to get to the studio.
We can always walk.
It's only 39 blocks.
If we start right now, we can still get there in time.
I have a better idea.
We can hitchhike.
I can lift my skirt, like that Clark Gable movie, It Happened One Night.
We'll have a ride in no time.
Please, you lift up your skirt, and someone might mistake your thigh for the on ramp to the freeway.
Let's hit it!
Hello.
Wow, aren't you Tiffany Blane?
The lady on Grab That Dough who stands in front of stuff - and does this.
- Yes.
Yes, I am.
How do you do?
I'm Dorothy Zbornak.
This is my mother, Sophia Petrillo.
And these are my friends, Rose and Blanche.
We're competing on today's show.
Well, hello, Tiffany.
It's such a pleasure to meet you.
I want you to know that I thought those pictures of you in that sleazy girlie magazine were so tastefully done.
By the way, was that a real English bobby spanking you there in front of Big Ben?
Now, ladies.
Would you like to meet the other contestants?
Oh, look, look.
There's Guy Corbin.
Oh, what a hunk.
Oh, that man makes my Ovaltine boil.
Good morning, ladies.
Welcome to our show.
I'm Guy Corbin.
And this morning, I've arranged something especially for you.
Fresh ground coffee and prune Danish.
Tiffany?
Why don't you tell them all about it right now.
Dorothy, could I have a word with you just a minute?
- Of course.
- Listen.
I've been talking to the other two contestants, the Kaplan Brothers.
I learned some very interesting things.
Number one, they have won over $40,000 in cash and prizes on various game shows.
Dorothy, I think you and I should team up with them.
Oh, Blanche.
That's impossible.
That would mean dumping Ma and Rose.
I know, it's terrible.
I feel awful thinking about it, but face it, if we team up with Fred and Willard, we stand a better chance of winning.
Blanche, I am shocked that you would even suggest such a thing.
Dorothy.
Your mother and Rose are dead weight.
Let's cut them loose before they drag us down.
Blanche, you expect me to betray one of my dearest friends, not to mention my own mother, just to win a few extra dollars.
- Yes.
- Okay, I'll do it.
All right, everyone.
We're about to go on the air.
Let's divide up into teams, and remember to jump up and down and scream a lot!
- Come on, Dorothy, we're on.
- Sophia, Rose, honey.
Before you go out, there's something you ought to know.
We're gonna team up with the Kaplans.
The Kaplan Brothers?
You mean you and Dorothy are joining a country western band?
That's the Gatlin Brothers, Rose.
The Kaplan Brothers are those gentlemen standing there.
You're dumping me and Rose for those two yutzes?
Oh, Ma, believe me, it's for the best.
If we split up, we double our chances of going home with something.
Cut the bull.
You don't want us 'cause you think we're too stupid.
Thirty seconds to air, take your places, please.
- Don't be mad, Ma.
- Get bent.
We're gonna cream you.
- Yeah.
- We're gonna maul you.
Yeah.
- We're gonna beat you into the ground.
- Yeah.
Okay, I'll give you Rose and $50 for your dumbest Kaplan Brother.
It's time to play Grab That Dough with your host, Guy Corbin.
Thank you.
Hello, everybody!
Welcome to Grab That Dough.
The show where all you really need to know to win, is how to make a fist.
Let's meet our lucky contestants.
First, on the green team, we have Dorothy Zbornak, an English teacher originally from Brooklyn, New York.
She now lives in Miami with her mother, who will gladly pay anyone who will take her out for a date.
Our second contestant is an artist with an incredible body.
She runs her own museum, speaks Chinese and hopes to sail around the world before she turns 40.
Wow, that must be a typo.
Welcome, Blanche Devereaux!
Our next two contestants are brothers from Milwaukee.
Blanche, that entire introduction was nothing but lies.
I know, and they just loved it.
Did you hear that applause?
Is that all you care about?
Money and applause?
And sex.
For which I generally get applause.
Our next contestant is a family counselor.
She originally hails from St. Olaf, Minnesota, where she was voted the girl most likely to get stuck in a tuba.
Welcome, Rose Nylund.
And last, but not least, is a grandmother of six.
Sophia Petrillo.
Sophia, it says here that you and Dorothy are mother and daughter.
No, Guy.
Rose is my daughter now.
Dorothy, you're the biggest disappointment to hit the streets since the AMC Pacer.
Say, it's time to play Grab That Dough.
Hands on buzzers.
Let's begin with our trivia lightning round.
What famous Tennessee Williams play was recently made into a film - by Paul Newman?
-  -  Willard.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
-  - Rose.
- Was it The Glass Menagerie?
- That's correct for 100 points.
What innovative industrialist invented the assembly line?
-  -  Willard.
I'm sorry, I did it again.
-  -  Sophia.
- Henry Ford.
- That's correct.
For another 100 points, who is the current Secretary of State?
-  Willard.
- Charles Schulz.
He created Peanuts.
I thought that was George Washington Carver.
Willard, don't ever touch your buzzer again.
-  -  Rose.
Is the correct answer George Schultz?
That's correct.
Rose is on a roll and the blue team is leading 300 to nothing.
I won!
- Shut up, Nylund.
- You shut up.
Why don't you both shut up and answer this next question.
For 100 points, complete this famous saying: "Better late than" -  - Blanche.
Pregnant.
That's incorrect.
But certainly not untrue.
-  - Rose.
Guy, is it "Better late than never"?
Right you are, Rose.
That signals the end of the trivia lightning round.
The blue team leads with 400 points while the green team trails with a big fat zero.
We'll be right back to take a spin on the big money wheel, right after this commercial message.
-  We're clear.
- Thanks.
So, Dorothy, how does it feel to have a big fat zero?
We'll catch up!
I wasn't talking about your score, I was talking about your partner.
We're too dumb, huh?
We're gonna whip your heinies.
The game's not over yet, Nylund.
It is for you, Devereaux.
Five seconds.
Once again, here's Guy Corbin.
Welcome back.
It's time to spin the big money wheel on Grab That Dough.
Spinners, mosey on down.
We'll start first with Blanche from the green team.
Blanche, show us your stuff.
- You first, Mr. Game Show Host.
- Blanche, spin the wheel.
You're landing on -  - Grab that dough!
Yes, Blanche, you landed on "grab that dough".
- You know what that means?
- Yeah, we're shafted.
That's right, Sophia.
The green team automatically wins a chance to grab that dough at our magic money machine.
Come this way.
Now, green team, you have 15 seconds to grab as much money as you can.
Who's going to grab today?
I'm going to grab today, Guy.
Wonderful, you ought to make quite a haul with those meathooks.
Tiffany.
Let's have our big money smock and the big money goggles.
Remember, Dorothy, you need to grab $500 to beat the blue team and get a chance at what's behind the window.
Ready?
She's all ready to grab that dough!
-  - Oh, time's up.
Oh!
Let's see how she did.
Help her out.
Okay, Dorothy, let's see how you did.
seven, eight, $900!
The green team makes a miraculous comeback and wins the game!
Oh, blue team, we don't want you to go away empty handed, you have $400, that's $100 a piece, and you have the home version of Grab That Dough which attaches to any vacuum cleaner.
Thank you for being with us.
Cram it, piano teeth.
Now, green team, what are you going to do with all that dough?
Are you going to keep it, or are you going to trade it for what's behind one of our windows?
I say, let's go for the window.
No, we have to discuss this with everyone.
Okay, Guy, we're gonna go for what's behind the window.
Will you take window one,  window two,  or window three?
Window three, Guy.
All right, but first, let's see what you didn't pick.
Behind window one, brand new living room furniture.
Retail price for this magnificent prize, $12,000.
But that's not what you picked.
Thanks for pointing that out.
You're welcome, Dorothy.
Let's see what's behind window two.
It's a brand new car.
Yes, it's that beautiful sports car you've always dreamed of.
Retail price, $23,000.
Now, Dorothy, Blanche, Willard and Fred, it's time to see what you did pick.
Are you ready?
- We're ready.
- Yes, yes.
Because have I got something for you a brand new electric skillet!
A what?
An electric skillet that's from Fry Quick.
It not only fries, it boils, it bakes, it simmers It stinks!
My apologies to the Fry Quick corporation.
But green team, we're not finished with you yet.
You need something to go in that skillet.
A car!
We want a car!
No, a lifetime supply of soup!
Yes, it's soup, soup and more soup.
Every kind you can imagine and it's yours for the rest of your lifetime.
Well, that's our show for today, folks.
Contestants, come on down and give a Grab That Dough goodbye.
Goodbye, everybody.
Thank goodness we're home.
That's the worst trip I've ever been on.
Blanche, how can you say that?
How can she say that?
We lost our luggage, we slept in a hotel lobby, our purses were stolen We won zippo on the game show.
But we still have our friendship.
We made up on the plane There was nothing else to do.
It was either that or watch Three Amigos with the headset.
Well, I am gonna forget all about this while soaking in a nice warm tub.
- Me, too.
- Rose, we only have one tub.
- I get the deep end.
- Rose!
Ma.
Ma, you're still mad at me, aren't you?
Dorothy, you let greed cloud your judgment.
Money blinded you.
You turned your back on the people you love.
You did a terrible, terrible thing.
It's unforgivable.
Ma, isn't there anything I can do to make it up to you?
- Give me $100.
- Make it 50.
Done, I love you.

Thank you for being a friend  Traveled down the road and back again  Your heart is true  You're a pal and a confidante  And if you threw a party  Invited everyone you knew  You would see The biggest gift would be from me  And the card attached would say  Thank you for being a friend  Hi, Sophia.
Ooh, what you making?
Lasagna al forno.
Smells delicious.
Yeah.
My great Aunt Nicolinda used to say, "Making lasagna al forno is like crossing a river.
"If you roll up your pants, dont be surprised if you find clams nipping at your heels".
- Whatd she mean?
- How should I know?
She was a hopeless alcoholic.
- Here.
Have a taste.
- Ooh.
Hi, girls.
How did the audition for the play go?
Awful.
We just got two tiny parts.
Were doing Sound of Music, and Blanche didnt get the lead.
I cant believe you werent cast in the lead.
Youve gotten it the past five years.
They hired a new director, and he has no taste.
Blanche used to sleep with the old one.
The new directors gay.
A gay theater director.
Did you ever hear of such a thing?
Its absolutely shocking.
Next thing you know theyll have black basketball players in the NBA.
Ma, you are making lasagna al forno.
What is the occasion?
Theres no occasion.
I just know its your favorite.
-  - I'll get it.
This takes 12 hours to make.
What do you want?
Nothing.
And it takes 16.
The only time you make lasagna al forno is for funerals and favors.
Youre not wearing black, so what do you want?
Nothing.
Dorothy, youre a sick, suspicious, paranoid person.
Stan, my favorite ex-son-in-law.
Oh!
God!
Stanley, what the hell are you doing here?
Dont talk to him like that.
I invited him.
- What?
- I love your toupee, Stanley.
- Is it new?
- Yeah.
The guy at the shop calls it the Dan Rather model.
You think it makes me look more intellectual?
Oh, absolutely.
By the way, Stanley, your fly is open.
- I'm so embarrassed.
- Dont worry about it.
I hear that Dan Rather has the same problem.
Thats why he sits behind a desk.
Ma, listen, I want some answers.
Now, why did you prepare my favorite meal and then invite my least favorite person to come eat it with us?
All right.
All right.
I need a favor.
Remember my brother Angelo?
He was at your wedding.
Hes a priest who lives in Sicily.
Hes going to Brooklyn next week and insisted on stopping off in Miami one day to wish you two a happy 40th wedding anniversary.
But were not married anymore.
Which brings me to the lasagna al forno.
I want you to pretend youre still married and that were all living here.
I will not take part.
The institution of marriage is sacred.
- Ill give you 50 bucks.
- Okay.
Dorothy, its only for one afternoon.
Itll break your uncles heart if youre divorced.
Ma, forget it.
Were divorced because Stanley cheated on me.
He is a loathsome, repulsive creature.
Even the thought of pretending to be married makes me ill.
Fine, but I'm still staying for dinner.
If you dont do this, I'll never speak to you again.
- I dont care.
- Ill invite Stan over every night.
How bad can it be?
Its just for the day.
Blanche, I just pressed our costumes.
Im nervous about the rehearsal tonight.
What do you say we go over our lines again.
Sure.
Can we take it from the top of scene three?
Im standing on the balcony of the von Trapp home listening to artillery shells bursting in the distance, and you come running on from upstage.
- Okay.
You ready?
- Yes.
The Nazis are coming!
The Nazis are coming!
Everybody, grab a gun and go in the basement!
Come on!
Move.
No, no, no, no.
Sophia, now, just relax.
Were just going over our lines for The Sound of Music.
Oh, thank God.
Whooo, it is really coming down.
Whats coming down?
The Liberace marquee at Caesars Palace.
Rain!
Rain, Rose!
Where is that idiot Stan?
Angelo will be here any minute.
I dont know where he is.
Stans always late.
He was late for our first date.
And then you were late.
Which is why you had to marry that stupid, lazy, no-good, pinhead of a prince.
This man is a prince.
Come in, Stan.
Im sorry Im late.
The rain really tied up the traffic.
Hi, girls.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Hello, Mama Bear.
Papa Bears back in the cave.
I could vomit just looking at you.
That must be Angelo.
You two go put the back.
He cant see you here.
Go ahead.
Go.
Go.
Angelo!
Sophia!
You look terrific.
You havent changed a bit in 40 years.
Angelo, youre a priest.
You shouldnt lie.
Dont worry about it.
Dont worry about it.
Before the trip, I said an extra 50 Hail Marys in case I felt like a-cutting a-loose.
Dorothy!
Uncle Angelo, it is so good to see you.
Dorothy, you know something?
You look more beautiful now than you did on your wedding day.
You just used up all 50 Hail Marys on that one.
Stanley, youre still a funny guy.
You got a sense of humor still, huh?
He still make you laugh?
Not really.
But then again, I havent seen him naked lately.
Would you listen to those two.
Always with the quips.
So, tell me, how are the children?
Oh, Uncle Angelo, theyre all grown up.
How nice.
Kate is an interior decorator in New York, and Michael is a very successful musician.
Michael didnt want go in the novelty business with me.
Yes.
It was a crushing blow when he decided to join the Boston Philharmonic instead of selling rubber dog poop door-to-door.
Dont knock the novelty business, snookums.
Rubber dog poop and joy buzzers provided nicely for you, the kids And several stewardesses.
Stewardesses?
Uh, they adopted them.
After Asian babies, theyre the most popular.
Ma, could I please see you in the kitchen?
Hurry back, Mama Bear.
Papa Bear gets lonely without you.
Ow!
Things are going very nicely.
I am going to tell Uncle Angelo the truth.
Its only for a couple of hours more.
I cant do it.
Pretending were married, acting as though nothing happened is making me crazy.
Its time to take my heart medicine.
You need water to take your pill?
No pills.
Ill take a shpt of Scotch, 12 years old, if youve got it.
Uncle Angelo, I have a confession to make.
Good.
I get my Scotch, and we go in the closet.
No, its about Stan and me.
You know something, Dorothy?
On your wedding day, Sophia told me, she said your marriage is never gonna last.
That made me very sad.
And now I see you and Stan so happy after all these years, it does an old mans heart good.
And so does-a that.
Uncle Angelo Im so glad I disobeyed doctors orders and risked this long trip to see the both of you so much in love.
Now, what were you saying?
Uncle Angelo, I wanted to say Well, dont just stand there, Papa Bear.
Come give Mama Bear a big bear hug.
Can I get you another slice of cake, Uncle Angelo?
- No, thank you.
- Ill take a slice, darling.
No problem, sweetheart.
Hurry back, dumpling.
My feet have wings, barf bag.
Dorothy, please, hang in there.
A little while longer, Angelo will be on a plane for Brooklyn.
I wish I'd taken my raincoat.
Why are you two dressed like that?
These are our costumes for the play, Dorothy.
We were in the middle of rehearsal when they told us to go home.
Theres a hurricane heading for Miami.
I will take a slice of cake.
Hello.
Uncle Angelo, Id, uh, like you to meet, uh uh Im Sister Rose.
How do you do?
Nice to meet you.
- Im Sister Blanche.
- Glad to meet you.
Were here, uh, collecting lingerie for needy sexy people.
The airports are closed.
Theres a hurricane headed this way.
They want everyone to stay where they are.
That means we could be trapped together for days.
Oh, Jesus!
Please protect us and watch over us in this our hour of need.
Amen.
Boy, its really coming down put there.
I've never been through a hurricane before.
Theres nothing to be afraid of.
Ive been through hurricanes.
Actually, they could be kind of fun.
I remember one when I was married.
- Married?
- Mary.
I was Mary in the Christmas pageant at the convent.
Remember that, Sister Rose?
Oh, my, yes.
Sister Blanche is quite an actress.
Shed have to be to make anyone believe she was a virgin.
Stanley, youre a pig in a cheap suit.
- You know, for two cents - You could get a better toupee?
Ive had enough.
Im not going on with this anymore.
Angelo, look.
St. Francis of Assisi.
Shut up and play ball, you yutz.
False alarm.
Never mind.
Lets all go to bed.
Angelo, you can sleep in my room.
Well, wont it be crowded?
Please.
In Sicily, we slept four in a bed.
Yeah, but theres six of us.
I meant just you and me.
Oh-hp!
Fancy.
Oh, come on.
Lets go to bed.
Yeah.
Im beat.
- Me, too.
- Me, too.
Me, too.
-  Ow!
-   Who is it?
Its Uncle Angelo.
Come in.
Dorothy, would you do me a favor?
Oh, of course, Uncle Angelo.
Anything.
I want you to sleep with this man.
Forget it.
Please, Im a-begging you as a man of the cloth.
Now I know how Jessica Hahn must have felt.
Look, Im sorry, Uncle Angelo.
We had a fight.
I know, and I wanna go to bed.
So you two kids, please make up.
Fine.
Fine.
Were made up.
Thank you.
Good night.
Sweet dreams.
I know its been a while, but control yourself.
I need some rest.
- What is that for?
- Youre not getting into this bed.
- Where am I supposed to sleep?
- On the floor like any dog.
Fine.
Stan Zbornak doesnt have to beg a woman to get into bed.
Women come to me.
Yeah.
After they get the approval number on your MasterCard.
- Good night.
- Oh, shut up.
Stanley, if youre doing what I think youre doing, youre in big trouble.
I was remembering the first time you kicked me put of bed and I had to sleep on the floor.
Emil Zuntz's Hidden Honeymoon Hideaway in the Poconos.
Where every cottage is April in Paris.
And every bathroom Calcutta in July.
You remember how I convinced you to let me back in?
No.
I've got a  Crush on you  Sweetie pie  All the day and nighttime  Hear me sigh  Stanley Zbornak, I dont believe that youre trying to charm me.
- Is it working?
- I dont think so.
You leave me no choice.
Ill have to pull put the big gun.
Youre wasting your time, Stanley.
Im familiar with the big gun.
Here goes.
Embrace me  My sweet embraceable you  Embrace me  You irreplaceable you  Dorothy!
Dorothy, I just had a terrible nightmare.
- Ma, what was it?
- This.
Break it up.
Stanley, think of me as the Berlin Wall.
Try to climb over me, and youll know what barb wire between your legs feels like.
Gotcha.
Dorothy, how did this start?
- Cole Porter?
- Gershwin.
Thank God I came in time.
-  - Ill get it.
Hello.
Hi, Walter.
How are you?
Yeah, I feel like a caged animal in heat, too.
Oh!
Walter, you naughty boy.
Keep on talking.
What am I wearing?
Well, to be perfectly honest, a nuns outfit.
Oh!
That sounds good to me.
Uh-huh.
Ill be over there just as soon as this storm lets up.
Uh-huh.
Hes a leper.
Im the only one who'll touch him.
Good morning, everyone.
- Good morning.
- Ill make breakfast.
Its such a shame, you two stuck here on your 40th anniversary.
- Stuck with us.
- Fortieth anniversary?
Sure.
Todays the 25th, isnt it?
Yes.
Yeah, I guess it is.
I remember when my parents celebrated their 40th anniversary.
They did the cutest thing.
They renewed their marriage vows.
You two should do that.
Youve got a priest right here.
Itll be perfect.
Its sweet.
Its romantic.
Its spontaneous.
Its the dumbest idea I've ever had.
I think its a great idea.
- What?
- What?
Snookums, could I see you in the living room?
Sure.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Are you put of your mind?
Dorothy, just hear me put.
The last two days, you and me being here brought back a lot of good memories.
Last night when you and I were in bed together, I felt something.
That was my mothers knee.
Besides that.
There was still some of the old magic there.
Look, I know we loused things up the last time.
I loused things up.
But now we have a chance to give it another try.
Babe, I missed you.
I wanna go through with the ceremony.
Then well go down to city hall and make it legal.
- Stan - Dorothy, its fate.
Divine intervention.
The hurricane.
Us pretending were married.
If God didnt want us together, he would never have sent a priest.
Im not a priest.
Angelo, what do you mean youre not a priest?
I cannot go on with this deception any longer.
I cant marry you.
Im not a priest.
I never was.
Uncle Angelo, what are you talking about?
I gotta sit down.
Let me tell you a story.
Picture it: Sicily, 1914.
I promised our dear sainted mother on her deathbed Im-a gonna join the priesthood.
On my way to the seminary in Palermo, I stop off in a local trattoria for a glass of Chianti.
The waitress bring drink to the table is a vision.
Luscious lips, full bosom and a behind so round, so firm, you got to fall down on your knees and cry put at its magnificent regal beauty.
Im a butt man.
Anyway, my devotion to God doesnt waver.
But suddenly, the idea of living with a bunch of guys in itchy robes doesnt seem quite as appealing as that tuckus.
So I tear up my priest application, ask Filomena to marry me, and we lived the next 72 years in wedded bliss.
Why did you keep it a secret all these years?
I was afraid my family gonna turn on me they find put I broke a promise to Mama on her deathbed.
I promised Mama Id marry Benito, the towns organ grinder monkey hat manufacturer.
- And you didnt do it?
- Please.
I loved my mother dearly, but I had my own life to live.
You did, too, Angelo.
- Can you ever forgive me?
- Oh, of course, Uncle Angelo.
Actually, weve all been deceitful, too.
Stanley and I are divorced.
I hope youre not disappointed.
No.
Im thrilled.
I never liked him.
Hes a yutz.
And were not really nuns.
Were actually gorgeous private citizens.
- Now Im confused.
- Come to the kitchen.
Ill fix you some breakfast and explain the whole thing.
Look, everybody.
The storms letting up.
Im gonna run right over to Walters.
Arent you gonna change?
No.
Its still pretty windy.
Im gonna go outside and see if I can get airborne.
Well, Id better get going, too.
Uh, Stan.
About what you said.
Hey, Dorothy, uh, I was kidding.
It was a joke.
Thats what I figured.
Well, you didnt think I meant it, did you?
- Well, no.
Of course not.
- Of course not.
I'm strictly cheerleaders, wild parties, and hot tubs.
Stan, before I forget, a deals a deal.
Heres your 50.
Thats okay, Sophia.
This one's on the house.
Pull yourself together, pussycat.
Gershwin confused a lot of people.

- Hi.
- What you hiding?
- Nothing.
- What smells so awful?
- It's a new fragrance I'm wearing.
I'm sure that I don't have to ask this, but you are aware that toilet water comes in a bottle?
Here.
Oh, cat food.
Oh, Rose, have you been feeding those strays again?
I can't help it, Dorothy.
I heard them howling and moaning all night.
How do you ignore something like that?
I'm getting used to it.
My room's next to Blanche's.
Something smells good in here.
What's for lunch?
- It's cat food, Sophia.
- Is that seafood medley?
- Yes, it is.
- They used to feed that to us.
They did not make you eat cat food at Shady Pines.
I didn't say they made us eat it.
You had the option to go hungry.
By the way, I'm moving out tomorrow.
Ma, come back here!
What do you mean, you're moving out?
Your brother Phil called again.
Big Sally left him for good.
She packed the four kids and moved to another trailer court.
- I thought they had six kids.
- She had to leave two behind.
I think if they cross state lines, it's a parole violation.
Sophia, you mean you're moving for good?
Not for good.
I'm just gonna help him raise the kids.
I'll be back as soon as they graduate from high school.
Let's see.
They're 14 now.
That should be about ten, twelve years.
You can't just run off to help Phil every time he has a problem.
- I came here when you had a problem.
- I did not have a problem.
You came to live here because the home burned down.
That's right, Sophia.
Don't you remember?
- Hi there.
- Ma!
Ma, what's the matter?
Everyone is fine.
No one died.
The home burnt down.
My God.
How'd you get here?
- I hitched.
- Ma!
- A cab.
I took a cab.
- Well, you should've called.
I'm perfectly capable of managing by myself.
I don't need help.
I'm a totally independent person.
- I know.
I know.
- I need $67 for the cab.
$67?
Ma, this is crazy.
The home is 15 minutes from here.
My cab driver is Cuban.
He said there was an additional tax for a bilingual driver.
I'll take care of him.
Sit down, Sophia.
You must be exhausted.
Why?
I rode in the cab.
I didn't push it.
Oh, Sophia, honey, how nice to see you.
Who are you?
- It's me, Blanche.
- You look like a prostitute.
Sophia, the things you say.
She didn't mean that, Blanche.
Of course I mean it.
Look at her.
My cab driver would fall in love.
-  - Oh.
I'll get it.
Harry!
Hi.
My pretty!
Everybody, this is Harry.
- Harry, this is Rose.
- Rose.
- And Dorothy.
- Dorothy.
- And this is Sophia.
- Well, you must be Blanche's sister.
And you must be blind.
Sophia's home just burnt down.
- That's terrible.
- Not to me.
It was a retirement home.
You know what they did?
They set off the fire alarm in a retirement home.
Who can rush?
Half the people have walkers.
The other half can't get out of their chairs.
But they got bells going off like crazy.
You know what that does to hearts that only beat a few times a week?
It's not pretty.
We better go.
We have reservations.
I hope he's taking you to a cold climate.
Good night, ladies.
It was a pleasure.
Nice meeting you, Harry.
The man is a scuzzball.
The four of us have lived together for a long time.
How can you just walk in and announce that you're leaving?
Warden, I could make a break for it, but you'd shoot me going over the wall.
Sophia, couldn't you just visit Phil?
You don't have to move in permanently.
You're not gonna be comfortable there.
They live in a trailer.
You won't have privacy.
I bet you don't get your own bedroom.
We have our own rooms here, and I still don't get any privacy.
One of us always ends up sharing a bed.
Every time someone visits, I'm in your room, you're in my room, she's in her room, she's in your room.
Look at me.
- What?
- You're getting a cold.
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.
Tomorrow, a cold.
What is this, The Curse of the Cat Woman?
I'm a mother.
I know these things.
- Good night, Ma.
- Good night.
- What's that smell?
-  I don't smell anything.
Are you wearing something?
A little Ben Gay on my knees.
A little Vicks on my chest.
Deep Heat on my neck.
What are you trying to do, pickle yourself so you'll live to be 100?
Fine.
I'll wipe it off.
Tomorrow I'll be in a wheelchair.
- Good night, Ma.
- Good night.
Keep it up, I'll need a Dramamine.
- Ma.
- Is it morning already?
No, no.
I just wanted to ask you a question.
What?
How would you react if you were told that one of your kids was gay?
Your brother Phil is gay?
I knew it.
When he was a kid, we couldn't keep him away from those gladiator movies.
- Ma, Phil is not gay.
- You mean you're gay?
Your friend Jean is having some sort of membership drive?
- Ma.
- I know you don't get many dates, but stick with what you know.
At your age, it's very hard to break into something new.
- Good night.
- Ma, I am not gay.
I just wanted to get your reaction.
I'll tell you the truth.
If one of my kids was gay, I wouldn't love him one bit less.
I would wish him all the happiness in the world.
That's because you're the greatest mother in the world, and I love you.
Fine.
Now keep your fat mouth shut so I can get some sleep.
Jean thinks she's in love with Rose.
Heh.
- Ma, come on, it's not funny.
- The hell it's not.
Jean in love with Little Miss Muffet?
Come on!
What is going on?
- Nothing.
- Nothing.
Oh, come on now.
I heard you laughing.
What's so funny?
- For starters, Jean is a lesbian.
- Ma.
- What's funny about that?
- You aren't surprised?
Of course not.
I've never known any personally, but isn't Danny Thomas one?
Not Lebanese, Blanche.
Lesbian.
Lesbian.
Lesbian.
Lesbian?
Isn't that where one woman and another We already know what it means.
Jean's a very attractive woman.
She could have any man she wants.
- She doesn't want them.
- Well, why not?
A man has so much more to offer, you know what I mean?
I found out when Mark Perper was running for class president in 3rd grade.
What's that have to do with anything?
His campaign slogan was, "Vote for me and I'll show you my wee-wee".
He won by a landslide.
Well, I'll never understand what Jean doesn't see in the opposite sex, but if that's what makes her happy, that's fine by me.
-  One other thing.
- Jean thinks she's in love with Rose.
Rose?
Jean has the hots for Rose?
I don't believe it!
- I was pretty surprised myself.
- Well, I'll bet.
To think Jean would prefer Rose over me.
That's ridiculous!
- Blanche, please!
- You tell me the truth.
If you had to pick between me and Rose, who would you pick?
Blanche, pull yourself together!
Oh.
I'm sorry.
- Does Rose know?
- No.
Good.
I don't think you ought to tell her.
After all, she's not as worldly and sophisticated about these things as I am.
If she finds out Danny Thomas is a lesbian, it'll break her heart.
Salvadore, if you wanna fool around, take off your T-shirt.
You're gonna get linguini all over me.
Ma, go back to sleep.
It's just me, Dorothy.
- Get the hell out of my bed.
- Ma, have a heart.
The heat went out again.
I'm freezing to death.
You're the only one who has an electric blanket.
I'll die under here with you.
Your body's like a heat sponge.
You'll suck up all the heat, and I'll get up a frozen fish stick.
Just turn up the heat.
It's already on 9.
On 10, you can cook a Lean Cuisine.
Good night, Ma.
Girls, girls, could I please share your electric blanket?
- No!
- No!
Come on!
I can't sleep!
My bed's never been so cold.
Especially on a Saturday night.
Oh, all right.
Get in.
Did you hear that sound?
Yeah.
As long as I'm in my own bed, I'll do what I want.
I mean, it sounded like the heat kicking on.
Thank God.
Get back to your own beds.
- Hi, everybody.
- What are you doing?
Tinkering with the heater, trying to get it to work.
Rose, you're a genius.
Boy, that's a sentence you don't hear every day.
She's working great now, except for one little thing.
I turned the air conditioner on instead of the heater, and now it won't go off.
Great!
Now it's gonna be colder inside than it is outside.
I think you're right.
There's an icicle forming on the nose of my bunny slippers.
- Move over.
- Oh!
Ow!
Ohh!
- There.
That's not so bad.
- Get your bunny nose out of my butt.
- Let's just get some sleep.
- Good night, Ma.
Good night, Moe.
Good night, Larry.
I'm not gonna be able to sleep.
I'm on the wrong side of the bed.
I usually sleep on the right side, and I wanna be on the right side.
What is everyone so particular about?
In Sicily, four in a bed is a treat.
It means half your family is on vacation.
I slept with my two brothers until I was 17.
I was engaged to one for a very short period of time.
But that's a separate story.
- I wouldn't mind hearing it.
- Rose, shut up.
Stay where you are and go to sleep.
I have to go to work early in the morning.
- Oh, darn.
I forgot something.
- Go in your pajamas.
No, it's not that.
I forgot to say my prayers.
Oh, Rose, God wouldn't mind if you skipped a night.
He's very busy these days.
Most of his free time is spent talking to Pat Robertson.
Hello, God.
It's me, Rose Nylund.
I'm sorry to be getting in touch so late tonight.
- I hope I didn't wake you.
- Oh, God.
One at a time, Blanche.
Anyway, I just wanted to say I think you're still doing a terrific job.
Of course, there's some things I don't understand, like poverty and the spokesmodel category on Star Search.
But then again, you work your wonders in mysterious ways.
A couple of years ago, I would've frozen to death 'cause I was by myself.
Now I have Dorothy and Blanche and Sophia to keep me warm.
Not just on a cold winter's night, but all year long.
Take care of them, God.
If anything happened, I'd just  Rose, thanks for the lovely prayer.
Now shut up and get into bed.
Amen!
- Nice work, Dorothy.
- Wasn't me.
Sweet Jesus, am I in trouble.
Now I lay me down to sleep I love you all dearly, but I have to go where I'm needed, and Phil needs me.
You said Phil and his wife were getting along.
They were never right for each other.
She never appreciated him, never encouraged him.
With the right woman behind him, he could've had a real diamond in his front tooth.
Ma, you always stick up for him.
The fact is, he has always made the wrong choices when it came to women.
Oh, and you've always made the right choices when it came to relationships?
Need I remind the three of you of the yutz parade that's been through this house?
Sophia, be fair.
At our age, it's not easy to find the perfect man.
Maybe we have all dated our share of losers, but I personally have had my share of winners, too.
Please.
You've ridden more winners than Willie Shoemaker.
All I meant was there has been a variety of men in our lives.
Thanks for the ride home, Dirk.
See you at Tuesday's jazzercise class.
I'll see you then, unless I see you before then.
If you wouldn't mind, maybe we could go out.
Why, Dirk, did I just hear you ask me for a date?
Are you deaf?
I heard him from here.
So, Blanche, you think maybe we could have dinner Saturday night?
Why don't I just check my datebook and let you know.
- Sure.
I'll call you tomorrow.
- Okay.
Bye.
Bye.
Well, isn't this an interesting turn of events?
Gosh, I just don't know what I'm gonna do.
He is a little bit younger than I am.
You know what I think?
I can handle this relationship with Dirk.
- I'm going out with him Saturday night.
- Was there ever any doubt?
Momentarily.
This is strictly off the record, but Dirk's nearly five years younger than I am.
In what, Blanche, dog years?
I'm Blanche.
I'm Dorothy's roommate.
Would you get the door?
Dorothy's told me about you.
She seems to have left out one itty-bitty detail about you.
- That I'm a priest.
- Uh-huh.
She didn't know.
What'd she think, you were just a boring dresser?
She's never seen me in cleric's clothing.
I didn't know you priests could take your clothes off.
- We do a lot of things real people do.
- Except for one very important thing.
Boy, is that gonna put a hitch in Dorothy's plan.
Hello.
I'm Rose Nylund.
You must be Frank.
- It's a pleasure to finally meet you.
- It's nice to meet you, too.
Dorothy's done nothing but talk about you.
Rose Every time she mentions your name, she practically glows.
- She's very smitten with you.
- Rose!
- He's a priest, isn't he?
- Yes, Rose.
I'm so sorry Hell Town was canceled.
Frank, Frank, I'm sorry.
I Please tell me that's a Nehru jacket.
No, it's not.
Rose, let's go heat up the lasagna.
Come on.
Come on.
Why didn't you tell me it was Father Leahy?
- I assumed you knew.
- No, I didn't.
And, frankly, I'm I'm a little embarrassed.
Well, me, too.
What difference does it make?
We can still be friends.
Of course we can.
I'm glad you're here.
Yeah, so am I. You look lovely tonight.
I look like the mother of a Solid Gold dancer.
Girls, I wanna give y'all my gift next, okay?
I thought this was such a cute idea, I made the same one for each of you.
Here.
Sophia.
"The Men of Blanche's Boudoir".
It's a calendar.
Each month has the picture of a man who's brought some special joy into my life.
Oh, Blanche.
Oh, honey, this is so thoughtful.
Whoa!
- September?
- Yep.
I'm surprised you were able to walk in October.
- So, uh, where are you going?
- Out with a friend, from work.
The friend you've been out with five times in three weeks?
- Yes.
- All right, spill it.
Who is he?
His name is Dr. Jonathan Newman.
He's a psychiatrist at the grief center.
So, Rose, you're seeing a psychiatrist.
It's about time.
Hello.
I'm Dr. Jonathan Newman.
Are you absolutely sure?
Yes.
May I come in?
Oh, please, please.
Please come right in.
- May I take your height hat?
- Thank you.
You must be Dorothy.
Rose has told me all about you.
I wish I could say the same.
Oh, Blanche, Blanche, this is Dr. Jonathan Newman.
Get out of here.
Blanche But he's a A little early, yes, but we're delighted to see him.
Hi, Jonathan.
Hello, Rose.
You're looking lovely.
Oh, wait a minute.
Rose Nylund, you devil, you.
I just figured out what's going on here.
Blanche.
You're sore at me for inviting your friend without asking, so you had this guy to come over and teach me a lesson.
Ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha!
God, I wish I was dead.
Blanche, let's go get the hors d'oeuvre.
Excuse us.
Oh, I have never been so embarrassed in my entire life.
- I made a fool of myself, didn't I?
- Yes!
Well, I feel awful.
Just awful.
Listen, if you don't want tonight to turn into a total disaster, you have to stop being so self-conscious.
Oh, well, you're right.
Of course.
Dr. Newman is a guest in our home.
If I'm self-conscious, he'll be ill at ease.
I can't allow that to happen.
It would be un-Southern.
That's a good belle.
Dorothy, get the door.
Shrimp?
Sophia, isn't there anything we can do to convince you to stay?
I wish you could, but my mind's made up.
My baby needs me.
What about me, Ma?
You've always been able to take care of yourself.
All right.
What about me?
You were strong and independent even before I got here.
- You don't need me.
- What about me?
You?
You need the Wizard of Oz.
I'm gonna pack.
Sophia, isn't there anything we can do to make you stay?
Nothing.
My mind's made up.
I'm leaving in the morning.
Oh!
Oh, you couldn't sleep either, huh?
No.
I can't believe that Ma's really gonna go.
Spent two hours trying to talk her out of it.
She still insists she's leaving.
I don't know what to do.
Let me get the cheesecake, and we'll talk.
-  Oh, my God.
- Blanche, what's wrong?
Here we are in the middle of a crisis, and there's no cheesecake.
- Didn't we buy one yesterday?
- Yes, but I found two gray hairs.
Blanche, you're over 50.
Finding two gray hairs is no reason to eat a whole cheesecake.
I found the two gray hairs in the cheesecake, so I threw it out.
Hi, girls.
I figured this might happen, so I bought a cheesecake.
Oh, Rose, that's great.
What's really great is they fired that gray-haired baker who refused to wear a net.
Well, let's slice this baby up and see if we can solve our Sophia problem.
Here, darling.
Do you know how many problems we have solved over a cheesecake at this kitchen table?
No.
Exactly how many?
The point I was trying to make is that we have had a lot of great late-night talks right here.
Yeah, and most of them have been about sex.
Oh!
Well, of course, we do talk about sex, but we talk about other things, too.
We console each other, we help each other, we advise each other, and then we talk about sex again.
I am so glad that my date with Barry is tomorrow.
- The fat won't have time to show.
- It won't?
No.
It always takes a few days before it shows.
Where does it go in the meantime?
To Connecticut!
How do I know where it goes?
With me, the minute it goes in my mouth, I balloon up.
I go out to dinner, and in the middle of the meal, my pants are cutting off my circulation so bad my feet are turning blue.
Well, I just wanna be svelte for Barry.
Barry Glick is very important to you.
Barry was the man that I wanted to be the first.
- First where?
- On Mars, Rose!
- My first lover.
- So what happened?
Stanley.
That's what happened.
Stanley.
I went to a drive-in with Stanley.
He said he was being shipped off to Korea and would probably die, and it would mean so much.
That was my part of the war effort.
It took three seconds.
I wasn't sure that we had done anything, actually, until nine months later when the baby came.
Then I figured out that we had.
You know, that was my only proof.
I waited till my wedding night.
No!
Yes!
And?
And it was a surprise.
How is that possible?
Another man showed up?
What I mean is, I had never seen a man before.
- A man?
- You know.
A man.
- No.
- Yes!
What about your father?
You mean, you never saw your father?
My father?
Oh, no!
My father?
Oh, my goodness, no!
I would've simply died!
- Oh, my God!
My father?
- Easy, easy!
Easy, Rose!
- Oh, my God!
- Easy!
The only things I ever saw were the animals on the farm.
- You know, the bulls and the horses.
- Tough act to follow.
Actually, that first night, I was kind of, well, appalled, I guess.
Charlie was very patient.
It was really very nice once I understood that that's what you were supposed to do and it wasn't some colossal joke.
Didn't you think it was a ridiculous thing to do the first time?
No.
I certainly didn't wait for my wedding night.
Honey, I couldn't.
I had these urges.
You know, in the South, we mature faster.
I think it's the heat.
I think it's the gin.
Anyhow, my first was Billy.
Oh, I remember it so well, just like it was yesterday.
That night under the dogwood trees, the air thick with perfume and me with Billy.
Or Bobby.
Yeah.
Bobby.
Yeah, it was Bobby.
Or was it Ben?
Oh, who knows?
Anyway, it started with a "B".
That first time, did you have Are you serious?
Why, many times that first time.
Many, many times.
- You did?
- You didn't?
No!
Oh, it was nice.
Being near Charlie was nice.
But it was five years before I knew what made your eyes go back in your head.
Dorothy, did you have How could I?
It always seemed to happen before I was in the room.
Blanche, you're out of bed.
This is wonderful.
No, it is not wonderful.
I was lying in bed eating.
If I don't get up and walk, I'm gonna become a hippo.
And life, if I can still call it that, has to go on, so here I am.
I'll just spend my remaining years in the company of women.
Only reason I'm sticking around is to read Danielle Steel's next book.
Because you're going through the change?
- God, I hate that expression.
- What is the big deal?
It's nothing.
Look at it this way.
You don't get cramps once a month.
You don't go on eating binges.
- You don't get crazy once a month.
- You just grow a beard.
- Don't listen to her, Blanche.
- You grow a beard.
I woke up one morning, I looked like Arafat.
Oh, my God!
- I never grew a beard.
- You never grew brains either.
Well, I'll tell you, menopause was wonderful for me.
- It meant no more PMS.
- I never had PMS.
Neither did I. But I had a BMW.
All right, I have had it.
Thanks to all this constant bickering, I have a headache.
Oh, girls, let's face facts.
The three of us just can't agree on anything.
It is obvious we were not meant to live together.
I hate to agree with you, but I think you're right.
I think so, too.
In fact, I know so.
This is exactly what happened during the Great Herring War.
The Great Herring War?
Between the Lindstroms and the Johanssons.
Oh, that Great Herring War.
The families controlled the most fertile herring waters off the coast of Norway.
Naturally it seemed like it would be in their best interests to band together.
Oh, boy, was that a mistake.
They couldn't agree on what to do with the herring.
Well, that's understandable.
I mean, the possibilities are overwhelming.
Exactly.
The Johanssons wanted to pickle the herring, and the Lindstroms wanted to train them for the circus.
Weren't they kind of hard to see riding on the elephants?
Oh, not that kind of circus.
A herring circus.
Sort of like Sea World, only smaller.
Much, much smaller.
But bigger than a flea circus.
Uh, tell me, Rose.
Uh  Did they ever shoot a herring out of a cannon?
Only once.
But they shot him into a tree.
After that, no other herring would do it.
You're making this up.
I am not.
My grandfather told me that story.
Of course he also used to call me by my sister's name.
And sometimes he'd wear his underwear on the outside of his pants.
I guess he wasn't a very reliable source.
Ohh!
Oh, girls, girls, do you realize what just happened?
I've been having a good time, and there wasn't even a man in the room.
Was it a fluke, or could we learn to like each other?
Well, I think it might take time, but but I think it could be worth it.
- Let's give it a shot.
- Great!
- I'm game.
- Okay.
Wait a minute.
What's that?
I'm sorry.
I know it's awful, but I have this incredible sweet tooth.
- What?
- Cheesecake.
- What kind?
- Chocolate.
I think this could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
We're halfway through the cheesecake, and we haven't solved our problem.
Maybe we can't solve it.
Maybe Ma's doing the right thing by leaving.
Your brother is such a yutz.
I just got off the phone with him.
He had the nerve to ask me what I'm making for dinner tomorrow.
- What'd you tell him?
- He should have dinner waiting for me, not that I'm such a big fan of squirrel gumbo.
How do you expect to live in the same house?
You haven't gotten there yet, and you're fighting.
What, this is Little House on the Prairie?
You're at each other's throats all the time.
There are more fights here than at Caesar's Palace.
Dorothy.
- Where's my heating pad?
- How should I know?
If this isn't it, I'd like to know what electrical appliance you're using under that blanket.
Here we are, Sophia.
The perfect after-dinner treat.
A nice dish of Jell-O.
I hate Jell-O.
If God wanted peaches suspended in midair, he would've filled 'em with helium.
- What?
- Beat it, Rose.
I'm busy.
- What are you doing?
- It's Tuesday.
I'm cleaning my purse.
Did all that stuff come out of your purse?
No.
I was also cleaning out my ears.
That's where the Feen-A-Mint and the rain bonnet came from.
Why are you in such a bad mood?
Forgive me, but I haven't had sex in 15 years, and it's starting to get on my nerves.
Hi, Rose.
Did you get a chance to play around with those lyrics I gave you?
- Yeah.
Listen to this.
-  upbeat.
] Hey, that sounds great.
Let's take it from the top.
From the top.
Ooh, that sounds so musical.
- Tickle the ivories, Rose.
- Kootchy kootchy kootchy koo!
Rose, play or die!
Miami is nice  So I'll say it twice  Miami is nice  Miami is nice  Miami is Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
You put in an extra "Miami is nice".
It hurts the music if you don't put it in.
Yeah, but the lyrics don't make any sense.
It goes:  Miami is nice  So I'll say it twice Oh!
I see your point.
What about this?
"Miami is nice, so I'll say it thrice".
Right.
Who in the hell says "thrice"?
- It's a word.
- So is "intrauterine".
It does not belong in a song.
Miami, you're cuter than  An intrauterine  Do we have any orange juice left?
No.
We're all out.
Sophia, to hear you tell it, you'd think all we do is fight.
I didn't say all we do is fight.
We also talk about sex.
We already talked about sex.
I'm shocked.
Ma, you're gonna miss us.
The four of us had a lot of good times together.
And plenty of headaches, too.
But one thing you have to admit, Sophia, it's certainly never dull around here.
-  - Okay.
-  -   You shot my vase!
I heard footsteps and a man's voice, and the alarm went off.
It was Lester.
He accidentally set off the alarm.
- I'm sorry.
- You shot my vase.
- I didn't shoot Lester.
- I'd rather you shot Lester.
I think I'll pass on the nightcap, Blanche.
Go on home, you old fool.
- What happened?
- She shot my vase.
Thank God.
I hated that thing.
What are you doing shooting?
Are you crazy?
I heard a noise.
I thought it was the robbers.
I manage to live 80, 81 years.
I survived pneumonia, two operations, a stroke.
One night I'll belch, and Stable Mabel here will blow my head off!
There's a man in your bed.
- Oh, Sophia, there's not.
- Why, you devil, you.
So that was what we heard.
Rose!
Rose got lucky.
Not so lucky.
The man is dead.
- What?
- Dead.
Oh, Sophia!
He's not dead.
I was just in there.
I went to put back your laundry.
I see there's a man, so I introduce myself, but he doesn't answer.
- He's dead.
- He He's shy.
He's very shy.
Didn't sound so shy last night.
Okay, fine.
Let a dead guy lie there.
It's gonna be 98 degrees today.
It won't be pretty.
I'm sure he's not dead.
Rose, go look.
Dorothy, he's sleeping.
I don't wanna wake him.
You could light firecrackers in his nostrils.
You won't wake him.
Blanche Devereaux?
Just a moment.
Oh, my God.
My rear tires have less pressure in them.
I'm ready.
The moon is hanging awful low in the sky tonight, isn't it, Busty?
Josie.
It sure is, Biff.
- It makes me wanna kiss you, Josie.
- Mind your manners, Biff.
We're at the Fourth of July picnic.
The whole town is here.
- The hell with this town.
Come with me.
- But you're a drifter, Biff.
I can't just pull up stakes and run off with you.
Please reconsider, Josie.
You're the prettiest girl in the county.
I need to have your answer now.
What's it gonna be?
- I want you to take me, Biff.
-  Oh!
Oh!
See, Sophia?
We have great times together.
And it just won't be the same without you, Sophia.
Hey, this isn't easy for me either, but I have to do what I have to do.
What is it I have to do?
- You're leaving.
- Then I better pack.
You know what I'm gonna miss about Sophia most?
It's all that good advice she gives us.
Living all those years, she has a lot to draw on.
If she doesn't have anything to draw on, she just makes it up.
Sicily, 1912.
Picture this: Two young girls, best friends, who shared three things: A pizza recipe, some dough and a dream.
Everything is going great until one day a fast-talking pepperoni salesman gallops into town.
Of course both girls are impressed.
He dates one one night, the other the next night.
Pretty soon he drives a wedge between them.
Before you know it, the pizza suffers, the business suffers, the friendship suffers.
The girls part company and head for America, never to see one another again.
Rose, one of those girls was me.
The other one you probably know as Mama Celeste.
Why didn't you use your key?
I left it home.
I thought it would weigh me down.
- Sophia, how did you do?
- Great.
Easily a personal best.
- Tell us what happened.
- It was electric.
The starter fired his pistol, and like a shot, I left half my competition in the dust.
You were that fast?
No.
It was the over-80 category.
Most of them dropped from fright.
You're kidding.
Please!
There's a natural build to these kind of stories.
- I'm sorry.
- So, finally, the race was underway.
I start off slow.
I'm cagey like a panther.
But when the time is right, I pounce!
The crowd is on its feet.
"Sofia!
Sofia"!
My heart is pounding in my ears.
But then again, it always pounds in my ears.
I could see the finish line.
It was only 2, 300 yards away.
And then it happened.
What every runner dreads.
- I hit the wall.
- Aw.
Ma, you ran out of steam.
No, I actually hit a wall.
In Sicily, we never went to the doctor.
We went to the Widow Caravelli.
Whatever you had, she had a cure.
She was best known for this green salve she used to make to treat ear infections.
One day, she gave a batch to Salvadore, the village idiot.
He misunderstood the directions and put it on his linguini instead of in his ear.
If you're an idiot with a hearing problem, you do things like that.
It wasn't such a bad thing to do.
The stuff tasted great, and Salvadore decided to market it.
At first, it didn't move so well.
"Linguini with ear salve" on the menu doesn't look too appetizing.
But once he changed the name to "pesto sauce," it moved like hotcakes.
Ma, you're making this up.
So what?
I'm old.
I'm supposed to be colorful.
I'm gonna miss her.
Me, too.
Me, too.
I'm not gonna stand for it.
I am gonna march in there and tell her we need her as much as Phil does.
Blanche, forget it.
Her mind is made up.
If she's said it once, she's said it 100 times.
I'm staying.
Good night.
Come back.
What do you mean, you're staying?
What's the problem?
You already rented my room?
- What changed your mind?
- I just got off the phone with Phil.
Actually, I got off the phone with Phil's wife.
She's back, poor thing.
- "Poor thing"?
- She's in a state of shock.
She found out she couldn't do any better than Phil.
Not a storybook romance, but an ending's an ending, and there you have it.
Oh, we're so glad you decided to stay, honey.
When you were leaving, we started talking about the times we've shared.
It brought back a lot of great memories.
Ma, it wouldn't be the same without you.
- No!
- Hey, don't over-dramatize.
Things aren't so terrific around here.
The hell they're not.
Things are terrific here!
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Thank you for being a friend  Traveled down the road and back again  Your heart is true  You're a pal and a confidante  And if you threw a party  Invited everyone you knew  You would see The biggest gift would be from me  And the card attached would say  Thank you for being a friend  - Hi, Rose.
- Hi.
- What you hiding?
- Nothing.
- What smells so awful?
- It's a new fragrance I'm wearing.
I'm sure that I don't have to ask this, but you are aware that toilet water comes in a bottle?
Here.
Oh, cat food.
Oh, Rose, have you been feeding those strays again?
I can't help it, Dorothy.
I heard them howling and moaning all night.
How do you ignore something like that?
I'm getting used to it.
My room's next to Blanche's.
Something smells good in here.
What's for lunch?
- It's cat food, Sophia.
- Is that seafood medley?
- Yes, it is.
- They used to feed that to us.
They did not make you eat cat food at Shady Pines.
I didn't say they made us eat it.
You had the option to go hungry.
By the way, I'm moving out tomorrow.
Ma, come back here!
What do you mean, you're moving out?
Your brother Phil called again.
Big Sally left him for good.
She packed the four kids and moved to another trailer court.
- I thought they had six kids.
- She had to leave two behind.
I think if they cross state lines, it's a parole violation.
Sophia, you mean you're moving for good?
Not for good.
I'm just gonna help him raise the kids.
I'll be back as soon as they graduate from high school.
Let's see.
They're 14 now.
That should be about ten, twelve years.
You can't just run off to help Phil every time he has a problem.
- I came here when you had a problem.
- I did not have a problem.
You came to live here because the home burned down.
That's right, Sophia.
Don't you remember?
- Hi there.
- Ma!
Ma, what's the matter?
Everyone is fine.
No one died.
The home burnt down.
My God.
How'd you get here?
- I hitched.
- Ma!
- A cab.
I took a cab.
- Well, you should've called.
I'm perfectly capable of managing by myself.
I don't need help.
I'm a totally independent person.
- I know.
I know.
- I need $67 for the cab.
$67?
Ma, this is crazy.
The home is 15 minutes from here.
My cab driver is Cuban.
He said there was an additional tax for a bilingual driver.
I'll take care of him.
Sit down, Sophia.
You must be exhausted.
Why?
I rode in the cab.
I didn't push it.
Oh, Sophia, honey, how nice to see you.
Who are you?
- It's me, Blanche.
- You look like a prostitute.
Sophia, the things you say.
She didn't mean that, Blanche.
Of course I mean it.
Look at her.
My cab driver would fall in love.
-  - Oh.
I'll get it.
Harry!
Hi.
My pretty!
Everybody, this is Harry.
- Harry, this is Rose.
- Rose.
- And Dorothy.
- Dorothy.
- And this is Sophia.
- Well, you must be Blanche's sister.
And you must be blind.
Sophia's home just burnt down.
- That's terrible.
- Not to me.
It was a retirement home.
You know what they did?
They set off the fire alarm in a retirement home.
Who can rush?
Half the people have walkers.
The other half can't get out of their chairs.
But they got bells going off like crazy.
You know what that does to hearts that only beat a few times a week?
It's not pretty.
We better go.
We have reservations.
I hope he's taking you to a cold climate.
Good night, ladies.
It was a pleasure.
Nice meeting you, Harry.
The man is a scuzzball.
The four of us have lived together for a long time.
How can you just walk in and announce that you're leaving?
Warden, I could make a break for it, but you'd shoot me going over the wall.
Sophia, couldn't you just visit Phil?
You don't have to move in permanently.
You're not gonna be comfortable there.
They live in a trailer.
You won't have privacy.
I bet you don't get your own bedroom.
We have our own rooms here, and I still don't get any privacy.
One of us always ends up sharing a bed.
Every time someone visits, I'm in your room, you're in my room, she's in her room, she's in your room.
Look at me.
- What?
- You're getting a cold.
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.
Tomorrow, a cold.
What is this, The Curse of the Cat Woman?
I'm a mother.
I know these things.
- Good night, Ma.
- Good night.
- What's that smell?
-  I don't smell anything.
Are you wearing something?
A little Ben Gay on my knees.
A little Vicks on my chest.
Deep Heat on my neck.
What are you trying to do, pickle yourself so you'll live to be 100?
Fine.
I'll wipe it off.
Tomorrow I'll be in a wheelchair.
- Good night, Ma.
- Good night.
Keep it up, I'll need a Dramamine.
- Ma.
- Is it morning already?
No, no.
I just wanted to ask you a question.
What?
How would you react if you were told that one of your kids was gay?
Your brother Phil is gay?
I knew it.
When he was a kid, we couldn't keep him away from those gladiator movies.
- Ma, Phil is not gay.
- You mean you're gay?
Your friend Jean is having some sort of membership drive?
- Ma.
- I know you don't get many dates, but stick with what you know.
At your age, it's very hard to break into something new.
- Good night.
- Ma, I am not gay.
I just wanted to get your reaction.
I'll tell you the truth.
If one of my kids was gay, I wouldn't love him one bit less.
I would wish him all the happiness in the world.
That's because you're the greatest mother in the world, and I love you.
Fine.
Now keep your fat mouth shut so I can get some sleep.
Jean thinks she's in love with Rose.
Heh.
- Ma, come on, it's not funny.
- The hell it's not.
Jean in love with Little Miss Muffet?
Come on!
What is going on?
- Nothing.
- Nothing.
Oh, come on now.
I heard you laughing.
What's so funny?
- For starters, Jean is a lesbian.
- Ma.
- What's funny about that?
- You aren't surprised?
Of course not.
I've never known any personally, but isn't Danny Thomas one?
Not Lebanese, Blanche.
Lesbian.
Lesbian.
Lesbian.
Lesbian?
Isn't that where one woman and another We already know what it means.
Jean's a very attractive woman.
She could have any man she wants.
- She doesn't want them.
- Well, why not?
A man has so much more to offer, you know what I mean?
I found out when Mark Perper was running for class president in 3rd grade.
What's that have to do with anything?
His campaign slogan was, "Vote for me and I'll show you my wee-wee".
He won by a landslide.
Well, I'll never understand what Jean doesn't see in the opposite sex, but if that's what makes her happy, that's fine by me.
-  One other thing.
- Jean thinks she's in love with Rose.
Rose?
Jean has the hots for Rose?
I don't believe it!
- I was pretty surprised myself.
- Well, I'll bet.
To think Jean would prefer Rose over me.
That's ridiculous!
- Blanche, please!
- You tell me the truth.
If you had to pick between me and Rose, who would you pick?
Blanche, pull yourself together!
Oh.
I'm sorry.
- Does Rose know?
- No.
Good.
I don't think you ought to tell her.
After all, she's not as worldly and sophisticated about these things as I am.
If she finds out Danny Thomas is a lesbian, it'll break her heart.
Salvadore, if you wanna fool around, take off your T-shirt.
You're gonna get linguini all over me.
Ma, go back to sleep.
It's just me, Dorothy.
- Get the hell out of my bed.
- Ma, have a heart.
The heat went out again.
I'm freezing to death.
You're the only one who has an electric blanket.
I'll die under here with you.
Your body's like a heat sponge.
You'll suck up all the heat, and I'll get up a frozen fish stick.
Just turn up the heat.
It's already on 9.
On 10, you can cook a Lean Cuisine.
Good night, Ma.
Girls, girls, could I please share your electric blanket?
- No!
- No!
Come on!
I can't sleep!
My bed's never been so cold.
Especially on a Saturday night.
Oh, all right.
Get in.
Did you hear that sound?
Yeah.
As long as I'm in my own bed, I'll do what I want.
I mean, it sounded like the heat kicking on.
Thank God.
Get back to your own beds.
- Hi, everybody.
- What are you doing?
Tinkering with the heater, trying to get it to work.
Rose, you're a genius.
Boy, that's a sentence you don't hear every day.
She's working great now, except for one little thing.
I turned the air conditioner on instead of the heater, and now it won't go off.
Great!
Now it's gonna be colder inside than it is outside.
I think you're right.
There's an icicle forming on the nose of my bunny slippers.
- Move over.
- Oh!
Ow!
Ohh!
- There.
That's not so bad.
- Get your bunny nose out of my butt.
- Let's just get some sleep.
- Good night, Ma.
Good night, Moe.
Good night, Larry.
I'm not gonna be able to sleep.
I'm on the wrong side of the bed.
I usually sleep on the right side, and I wanna be on the right side.
What is everyone so particular about?
In Sicily, four in a bed is a treat.
It means half your family is on vacation.
I slept with my two brothers until I was 17.
I was engaged to one for a very short period of time.
But that's a separate story.
- I wouldn't mind hearing it.
- Rose, shut up.
Stay where you are and go to sleep.
I have to go to work early in the morning.
- Oh, darn.
I forgot something.
- Go in your pajamas.
No, it's not that.
I forgot to say my prayers.
Oh, Rose, God wouldn't mind if you skipped a night.
He's very busy these days.
Most of his free time is spent talking to Pat Robertson.
Hello, God.
It's me, Rose Nylund.
I'm sorry to be getting in touch so late tonight.
- I hope I didn't wake you.
- Oh, God.
One at a time, Blanche.
Anyway, I just wanted to say I think you're still doing a terrific job.
Of course, there's some things I don't understand, like poverty and the spokesmodel category on Star Search.
But then again, you work your wonders in mysterious ways.
A couple of years ago, I would've frozen to death 'cause I was by myself.
Now I have Dorothy and Blanche and Sophia to keep me warm.
Not just on a cold winter's night, but all year long.
Take care of them, God.
If anything happened, I'd just  Rose, thanks for the lovely prayer.
Now shut up and get into bed.
Amen!
- Nice work, Dorothy.
- Wasn't me.
Sweet Jesus, am I in trouble.
Now I lay me down to sleep I love you all dearly, but I have to go where I'm needed, and Phil needs me.
You said Phil and his wife were getting along.
They were never right for each other.
She never appreciated him, never encouraged him.
With the right woman behind him, he could've had a real diamond in his front tooth.
Ma, you always stick up for him.
The fact is, he has always made the wrong choices when it came to women.
Oh, and you've always made the right choices when it came to relationships?
Need I remind the three of you of the yutz parade that's been through this house?
Sophia, be fair.
At our age, it's not easy to find the perfect man.
Maybe we have all dated our share of losers, but I personally have had my share of winners, too.
Please.
You've ridden more winners than Willie Shoemaker.
All I meant was there has been a variety of men in our lives.
Thanks for the ride home, Dirk.
See you at Tuesday's jazzercise class.
I'll see you then, unless I see you before then.
If you wouldn't mind, maybe we could go out.
Why, Dirk, did I just hear you ask me for a date?
Are you deaf?
I heard him from here.
So, Blanche, you think maybe we could have dinner Saturday night?
Why don't I just check my datebook and let you know.
- Sure.
I'll call you tomorrow.
- Okay.
Bye.
Bye.
Well, isn't this an interesting turn of events?
Gosh, I just don't know what I'm gonna do.
He is a little bit younger than I am.
You know what I think?
I can handle this relationship with Dirk.
- I'm going out with him Saturday night.
- Was there ever any doubt?
Momentarily.
This is strictly off the record, but Dirk's nearly five years younger than I am.
In what, Blanche, dog years?
I'm Blanche.
I'm Dorothy's roommate.
Would you get the door?
Dorothy's told me about you.
She seems to have left out one itty-bitty detail about you.
- That I'm a priest.
- Uh-huh.
She didn't know.
What'd she think, you were just a boring dresser?
She's never seen me in cleric's clothing.
I didn't know you priests could take your clothes off.
- We do a lot of things real people do.
- Except for one very important thing.
Boy, is that gonna put a hitch in Dorothy's plan.
Hello.
I'm Rose Nylund.
You must be Frank.
- It's a pleasure to finally meet you.
- It's nice to meet you, too.
Dorothy's done nothing but talk about you.
Rose Every time she mentions your name, she practically glows.
- She's very smitten with you.
- Rose!
- He's a priest, isn't he?
- Yes, Rose.
I'm so sorry Hell Town was canceled.
Frank, Frank, I'm sorry.
I Please tell me that's a Nehru jacket.
No, it's not.
Rose, let's go heat up the lasagna.
Come on.
Come on.
Why didn't you tell me it was Father Leahy?
- I assumed you knew.
- No, I didn't.
And, frankly, I'm I'm a little embarrassed.
Well, me, too.
What difference does it make?
We can still be friends.
Of course we can.
I'm glad you're here.
Yeah, so am I. You look lovely tonight.
I look like the mother of a Solid Gold dancer.
Girls, I wanna give y'all my gift next, okay?
I thought this was such a cute idea, I made the same one for each of you.
Here.
Sophia.
"The Men of Blanche's Boudoir".
It's a calendar.
Each month has the picture of a man who's brought some special joy into my life.
Oh, Blanche.
Oh, honey, this is so thoughtful.
Whoa!
- September?
- Yep.
I'm surprised you were able to walk in October.
- So, uh, where are you going?
- Out with a friend, from work.
The friend you've been out with five times in three weeks?
- Yes.
- All right, spill it.
Who is he?
His name is Dr. Jonathan Newman.
He's a psychiatrist at the grief center.
So, Rose, you're seeing a psychiatrist.
It's about time.
Hello.
I'm Dr. Jonathan Newman.
Are you absolutely sure?
Yes.
May I come in?
Oh, please, please.
Please come right in.
- May I take your height hat?
- Thank you.
You must be Dorothy.
Rose has told me all about you.
I wish I could say the same.
Oh, Blanche, Blanche, this is Dr. Jonathan Newman.
Get out of here.
Blanche But he's a A little early, yes, but we're delighted to see him.
Hi, Jonathan.
Hello, Rose.
You're looking lovely.
Oh, wait a minute.
Rose Nylund, you devil, you.
I just figured out what's going on here.
Blanche.
You're sore at me for inviting your friend without asking, so you had this guy to come over and teach me a lesson.
Ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha!
God, I wish I was dead.
Blanche, let's go get the hors d'oeuvre.
Excuse us.
Oh, I have never been so embarrassed in my entire life.
- I made a fool of myself, didn't I?
- Yes!
Well, I feel awful.
Just awful.
Listen, if you don't want tonight to turn into a total disaster, you have to stop being so self-conscious.
Oh, well, you're right.
Of course.
Dr. Newman is a guest in our home.
If I'm self-conscious, he'll be ill at ease.
I can't allow that to happen.
It would be un-Southern.
That's a good belle.
Dorothy, get the door.
Shrimp?
Sophia, isn't there anything we can do to convince you to stay?
I wish you could, but my mind's made up.
My baby needs me.
What about me, Ma?
You've always been able to take care of yourself.
All right.
What about me?
You were strong and independent even before I got here.
- You don't need me.
- What about me?
You?
You need the Wizard of Oz.
I'm gonna pack.
Sophia, isn't there anything we can do to make you stay?
Nothing.
My mind's made up.
I'm leaving in the morning.
Oh!
Oh, you couldn't sleep either, huh?
No.
I can't believe that Ma's really gonna go.
Spent two hours trying to talk her out of it.
She still insists she's leaving.
I don't know what to do.
Let me get the cheesecake, and we'll talk.
-  Oh, my God.
- Blanche, what's wrong?
Here we are in the middle of a crisis, and there's no cheesecake.
- Didn't we buy one yesterday?
- Yes, but I found two gray hairs.
Blanche, you're over 50.
Finding two gray hairs is no reason to eat a whole cheesecake.
I found the two gray hairs in the cheesecake, so I threw it out.
Hi, girls.
I figured this might happen, so I bought a cheesecake.
Oh, Rose, that's great.
What's really great is they fired that gray-haired baker who refused to wear a net.
Well, let's slice this baby up and see if we can solve our Sophia problem.
Here, darling.
Do you know how many problems we have solved over a cheesecake at this kitchen table?
No.
Exactly how many?
The point I was trying to make is that we have had a lot of great late-night talks right here.
Yeah, and most of them have been about sex.
Oh!
Well, of course, we do talk about sex, but we talk about other things, too.
We console each other, we help each other, we advise each other, and then we talk about sex again.
I am so glad that my date with Barry is tomorrow.
- The fat won't have time to show.
- It won't?
No.
It always takes a few days before it shows.
Where does it go in the meantime?
To Connecticut!
How do I know where it goes?
With me, the minute it goes in my mouth, I balloon up.
I go out to dinner, and in the middle of the meal, my pants are cutting off my circulation so bad my feet are turning blue.
Well, I just wanna be svelte for Barry.
Barry Glick is very important to you.
Barry was the man that I wanted to be the first.
- First where?
- On Mars, Rose!
- My first lover.
- So what happened?
Stanley.
That's what happened.
Stanley.
I went to a drive-in with Stanley.
He said he was being shipped off to Korea and would probably die, and it would mean so much.
That was my part of the war effort.
It took three seconds.
I wasn't sure that we had done anything, actually, until nine months later when the baby came.
Then I figured out that we had.
You know, that was my only proof.
I waited till my wedding night.
No!
Yes!
And?
And it was a surprise.
How is that possible?
Another man showed up?
What I mean is, I had never seen a man before.
- A man?
- You know.
A man.
- No.
- Yes!
What about your father?
You mean, you never saw your father?
My father?
Oh, no!
My father?
Oh, my goodness, no!
I would've simply died!
- Oh, my God!
My father?
- Easy, easy!
Easy, Rose!
- Oh, my God!
- Easy!
The only things I ever saw were the animals on the farm.
- You know, the bulls and the horses.
- Tough act to follow.
Actually, that first night, I was kind of, well, appalled, I guess.
Charlie was very patient.
It was really very nice once I understood that that's what you were supposed to do and it wasn't some colossal joke.
Didn't you think it was a ridiculous thing to do the first time?
No.
I certainly didn't wait for my wedding night.
Honey, I couldn't.
I had these urges.
You know, in the South, we mature faster.
I think it's the heat.
I think it's the gin.
Anyhow, my first was Billy.
Oh, I remember it so well, just like it was yesterday.
That night under the dogwood trees, the air thick with perfume and me with Billy.
Or Bobby.
Yeah.
Bobby.
Yeah, it was Bobby.
Or was it Ben?
Oh, who knows?
Anyway, it started with a "B".
That first time, did you have Are you serious?
Why, many times that first time.
Many, many times.
- You did?
- You didn't?
No!
Oh, it was nice.
Being near Charlie was nice.
But it was five years before I knew what made your eyes go back in your head.
Dorothy, did you have How could I?
It always seemed to happen before I was in the room.
Blanche, you're out of bed.
This is wonderful.
No, it is not wonderful.
I was lying in bed eating.
If I don't get up and walk, I'm gonna become a hippo.
And life, if I can still call it that, has to go on, so here I am.
I'll just spend my remaining years in the company of women.
Only reason I'm sticking around is to read Danielle Steel's next book.
Because you're going through the change?
- God, I hate that expression.
- What is the big deal?
It's nothing.
Look at it this way.
You don't get cramps once a month.
You don't go on eating binges.
- You don't get crazy once a month.
- You just grow a beard.
- Don't listen to her, Blanche.
- You grow a beard.
I woke up one morning, I looked like Arafat.
Oh, my God!
- I never grew a beard.
- You never grew brains either.
Well, I'll tell you, menopause was wonderful for me.
- It meant no more PMS.
- I never had PMS.
Neither did I. But I had a BMW.
All right, I have had it.
Thanks to all this constant bickering, I have a headache.
Oh, girls, let's face facts.
The three of us just can't agree on anything.
It is obvious we were not meant to live together.
I hate to agree with you, but I think you're right.
I think so, too.
In fact, I know so.
This is exactly what happened during the Great Herring War.
The Great Herring War?
Between the Lindstroms and the Johanssons.
Oh, that Great Herring War.
The families controlled the most fertile herring waters off the coast of Norway.
Naturally it seemed like it would be in their best interests to band together.
Oh, boy, was that a mistake.
They couldn't agree on what to do with the herring.
Well, that's understandable.
I mean, the possibilities are overwhelming.
Exactly.
The Johanssons wanted to pickle the herring, and the Lindstroms wanted to train them for the circus.
Weren't they kind of hard to see riding on the elephants?
Oh, not that kind of circus.
A herring circus.
Sort of like Sea World, only smaller.
Much, much smaller.
But bigger than a flea circus.
Uh, tell me, Rose.
Uh  Did they ever shoot a herring out of a cannon?
Only once.
But they shot him into a tree.
After that, no other herring would do it.
You're making this up.
I am not.
My grandfather told me that story.
Of course he also used to call me by my sister's name.
And sometimes he'd wear his underwear on the outside of his pants.
I guess he wasn't a very reliable source.
Ohh!
Oh, girls, girls, do you realize what just happened?
I've been having a good time, and there wasn't even a man in the room.
Was it a fluke, or could we learn to like each other?
Well, I think it might take time, but but I think it could be worth it.
- Let's give it a shot.
- Great!
- I'm game.
- Okay.
Wait a minute.
What's that?
I'm sorry.
I know it's awful, but I have this incredible sweet tooth.
- What?
- Cheesecake.
- What kind?
- Chocolate.
I think this could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
We're halfway through the cheesecake, and we haven't solved our problem.
Maybe we can't solve it.
Maybe Ma's doing the right thing by leaving.
Your brother is such a yutz.
I just got off the phone with him.
He had the nerve to ask me what I'm making for dinner tomorrow.
- What'd you tell him?
- He should have dinner waiting for me, not that I'm such a big fan of squirrel gumbo.
How do you expect to live in the same house?
You haven't gotten there yet, and you're fighting.
What, this is Little House on the Prairie?
You're at each other's throats all the time.
There are more fights here than at Caesar's Palace.
Dorothy.
- Where's my heating pad?
- How should I know?
If this isn't it, I'd like to know what electrical appliance you're using under that blanket.
Here we are, Sophia.
The perfect after-dinner treat.
A nice dish of Jell-O.
I hate Jell-O.
If God wanted peaches suspended in midair, he would've filled 'em with helium.
- What?
- Beat it, Rose.
I'm busy.
- What are you doing?
- It's Tuesday.
I'm cleaning my purse.
Did all that stuff come out of your purse?
No.
I was also cleaning out my ears.
That's where the Feen-A-Mint and the rain bonnet came from.
Why are you in such a bad mood?
Forgive me, but I haven't had sex in 15 years, and it's starting to get on my nerves.
Hi, Rose.
Did you get a chance to play around with those lyrics I gave you?
- Yeah.
Listen to this.
-  upbeat.
] Hey, that sounds great.
Let's take it from the top.
From the top.
Ooh, that sounds so musical.
- Tickle the ivories, Rose.
- Kootchy kootchy kootchy koo!
Rose, play or die!
Miami is nice  So I'll say it twice  Miami is nice  Miami is nice  Miami is Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
You put in an extra "Miami is nice".
It hurts the music if you don't put it in.
Yeah, but the lyrics don't make any sense.
It goes:  Miami is nice  So I'll say it twice Oh!
I see your point.
What about this?
"Miami is nice, so I'll say it thrice".
Right.
Who in the hell says "thrice"?
- It's a word.
- So is "intrauterine".
It does not belong in a song.
Miami, you're cuter than  An intrauterine  Do we have any orange juice left?
No.
We're all out.
Sophia, to hear you tell it, you'd think all we do is fight.
I didn't say all we do is fight.
We also talk about sex.
We already talked about sex.
I'm shocked.
Ma, you're gonna miss us.
The four of us had a lot of good times together.
And plenty of headaches, too.
But one thing you have to admit, Sophia, it's certainly never dull around here.
-  - Okay.
-  -   You shot my vase!
I heard footsteps and a man's voice, and the alarm went off.
It was Lester.
He accidentally set off the alarm.
- I'm sorry.
- You shot my vase.
- I didn't shoot Lester.
- I'd rather you shot Lester.
I think I'll pass on the nightcap, Blanche.
Go on home, you old fool.
- What happened?
- She shot my vase.
Thank God.
I hated that thing.
What are you doing shooting?
Are you crazy?
I heard a noise.
I thought it was the robbers.
I manage to live 80, 81 years.
I survived pneumonia, two operations, a stroke.
One night I'll belch, and Stable Mabel here will blow my head off!
There's a man in your bed.
- Oh, Sophia, there's not.
- Why, you devil, you.
So that was what we heard.
Rose!
Rose got lucky.
Not so lucky.
The man is dead.
- What?
- Dead.
Oh, Sophia!
He's not dead.
I was just in there.
I went to put back your laundry.
I see there's a man, so I introduce myself, but he doesn't answer.
- He's dead.
- He He's shy.
He's very shy.
Didn't sound so shy last night.
Okay, fine.
Let a dead guy lie there.
It's gonna be 98 degrees today.
It won't be pretty.
I'm sure he's not dead.
Rose, go look.
Dorothy, he's sleeping.
I don't wanna wake him.
You could light firecrackers in his nostrils.
You won't wake him.
Blanche Devereaux?
Just a moment.
Oh, my God.
My rear tires have less pressure in them.
I'm ready.
The moon is hanging awful low in the sky tonight, isn't it, Busty?
Josie.
It sure is, Biff.
- It makes me wanna kiss you, Josie.
- Mind your manners, Biff.
We're at the Fourth of July picnic.
The whole town is here.
- The hell with this town.
Come with me.
- But you're a drifter, Biff.
I can't just pull up stakes and run off with you.
Please reconsider, Josie.
You're the prettiest girl in the county.
I need to have your answer now.
What's it gonna be?
- I want you to take me, Biff.
-  Oh!
Oh!
See, Sophia?
We have great times together.
And it just won't be the same without you, Sophia.
Hey, this isn't easy for me either, but I have to do what I have to do.
What is it I have to do?
- You're leaving.
- Then I better pack.
You know what I'm gonna miss about Sophia most?
It's all that good advice she gives us.
Living all those years, she has a lot to draw on.
If she doesn't have anything to draw on, she just makes it up.
Sicily, 1912.
Picture this: Two young girls, best friends, who shared three things: A pizza recipe, some dough and a dream.
Everything is going great until one day a fast-talking pepperoni salesman gallops into town.
Of course both girls are impressed.
He dates one one night, the other the next night.
Pretty soon he drives a wedge between them.
Before you know it, the pizza suffers, the business suffers, the friendship suffers.
The girls part company and head for America, never to see one another again.
Rose, one of those girls was me.
The other one you probably know as Mama Celeste.
Why didn't you use your key?
I left it home.
I thought it would weigh me down.
- Sophia, how did you do?
- Great.
Easily a personal best.
- Tell us what happened.
- It was electric.
The starter fired his pistol, and like a shot, I left half my competition in the dust.
You were that fast?
No.
It was the over-80 category.
Most of them dropped from fright.
You're kidding.
Please!
There's a natural build to these kind of stories.
- I'm sorry.
- So, finally, the race was underway.
I start off slow.
I'm cagey like a panther.
But when the time is right, I pounce!
The crowd is on its feet.
"Sofia!
Sofia"!
My heart is pounding in my ears.
But then again, it always pounds in my ears.
I could see the finish line.
It was only 2, 300 yards away.
And then it happened.
What every runner dreads.
- I hit the wall.
- Aw.
Ma, you ran out of steam.
No, I actually hit a wall.
In Sicily, we never went to the doctor.
We went to the Widow Caravelli.
Whatever you had, she had a cure.
She was best known for this green salve she used to make to treat ear infections.
One day, she gave a batch to Salvadore, the village idiot.
He misunderstood the directions and put it on his linguini instead of in his ear.
If you're an idiot with a hearing problem, you do things like that.
It wasn't such a bad thing to do.
The stuff tasted great, and Salvadore decided to market it.
At first, it didn't move so well.
"Linguini with ear salve" on the menu doesn't look too appetizing.
But once he changed the name to "pesto sauce," it moved like hotcakes.
Ma, you're making this up.
So what?
I'm old.
I'm supposed to be colorful.
I'm gonna miss her.
Me, too.
Me, too.
I'm not gonna stand for it.
I am gonna march in there and tell her we need her as much as Phil does.
Blanche, forget it.
Her mind is made up.
If she's said it once, she's said it 100 times.
I'm staying.
Good night.
Come back.
What do you mean, you're staying?
What's the problem?
You already rented my room?
- What changed your mind?
- I just got off the phone with Phil.
Actually, I got off the phone with Phil's wife.
She's back, poor thing.
- "Poor thing"?
- She's in a state of shock.
She found out she couldn't do any better than Phil.
Not a storybook romance, but an ending's an ending, and there you have it.
Oh, we're so glad you decided to stay, honey.
When you were leaving, we started talking about the times we've shared.
It brought back a lot of great memories.
Ma, it wouldn't be the same without you.
- No!
- Hey, don't over-dramatize.
Things aren't so terrific around here.
The hell they're not.
Things are terrific here!

How are you this morning?
My joints ache, my ears are ringing, and my butt dropped two inches on the way down the hall.
All in all, not bad.
- You want some breakfast?
- Not if you're making it.
Oh, come on.
It's an old family favorite: Chocolate chip pancakes made with brown sugar, honey whipped cream and maple syrup.
If God had meant man to eat like that, he would've handed him his teeth in a baggie.
- Well, excuse me for asking.
- I'm sorry.
I'm just irritable.
Poor Sophia.
You still upset because your friend Bernice moved to Chicago?
No, Rose.
I'm upset because I can't relate to Thirty something.
Of course that's why I'm upset.
I know just how you feel.
It's hard losing your buddy.
- You're telling me.
- Good morning, Sophia.
Rose, honey, you don't have time to eat.
As my campaign manager, it is your duty to spend every waking hour ensuring my victory so that once in office, I can implement the changes needed to move forward in the grand tradition of the founders of this, our great country.
What office are you running for?
Fashion show chairman of the Tinkerbelles.
Morning.
Rose, I hope you don't mind.
I borrowed your golf glove.
I have a date to play.
- With a man?
- No, Blanche, with a Venus flytrap.
- Of course with a man.
- Is it Raymond again?
Yes.
Isn't he the guy you picked up at the grocery store?
I did not pick him up.
He asked me if I could recommend a good coffee, and then I threw myself underneath his shopping cart.
I think he sounds really nice.
He is.
We've had a wonderful time together these past few weeks.
Girls, I really like him, and I think he likes me.
- Just don't ruin it and sleep with him.
- Of course not, Ma.
I only do that with men I plan to scar psychologically.
Oh, by the way, I forgot.
This came for you.
- A postcard from Bernice.
- I don't want it.
- Sophia, I thought you missed her.
- If I read that, I'll miss her more.
Ma, I know you're lonely for Bernice, but it's been over a month now.
It's not just Bernice.
The whole gang is gone.
Gladys went to live with her daughter, Edie got married, Alice died, Lillian is still around, but she thinks she's Pinky Lee.
I'm the only one who's left.
Then maybe it's time you tried to make new friends.
It's not that easy to make new friends.
It sure wasn't for the first Eskimo family that moved to St. Olaf.
They sawed a hole and went salmon fishing in the middle of the local ice skating rink.
And then there was the Halloween they gave all the kids whale blubber.
And then there was the time they borrowed every ice tray in town to build an addition over their garage.
What was the point?
I guess after the baby came, they needed more room.
The point of the story!
Well, gradually they were able to make friends, and they ended up the most popular family in town.
But only because they went out and met people.
Isn't that right, Rose?
No.
It was because in the drought of '49, their house melted and kept the town from dehydrating.
Listen, Ma, I have an idea.
Play golf with Raymond and me.
I would love to, but I don't own any ugly plaid polyester.
Rose, you have something in a size six?
Come on, Ma.
I'll help you pick something out.
- Must be Raymond.
- I'll be right out.
I just have to get some hard candy and my doughnut pillow.
- Hi, Dorothy.
- Come right in.
Raymond, I'm afraid I have something to tell you.
Oh, you shouldn't have.
I know.
- Shouldn't have done that either.
- Yes, you should.
Do it again.
Hey!
I have a Chiclet here somewhere if you're fighting over a piece of gum.
Hi, Sophia.
I didn't notice you there.
Well, I noticed your hands all over my daughter.
Did you hear your daughter complaining?
I apologize, Sophia.
Apology accepted.
Let's go.
Uh, that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
Ma's been feeling a little down lately, so I invited her to play golf with us.
Oh, wonderful.
- Glad to have you along.
- I know.
So, Sophia, tell me, have you played much?
Have I played?
Have I played?
Played what?
- Finished writing my campaign speech?
- Check.
- Sent invitations for the party?
- Check.
Made my appointment with the refreshment committee?
- Check.
- Good.
With all the work I put in on this campaign, I might as well run for fashion show chairman myself.
What's so funny?
You?
Rose, you can't be fashion show chairman.
You thought Giorgio Armani was a puppet on Ed Sullivan.
You don't think I'm smart enough for the job?
No.
I think you're smart enough.
You just have no taste.
Okay, girls, which goes better, the silver chain or the pearls?
The chain.
An amateur's mistake.
Can't you see that the chain accentuates the many folds of that turkey-like neck?
Well, that may be, but the pearls draw attention to the nonexistent bosom.
Yes, but the chain leads the eye even lower to that huge spare tire jutting out over those square, manly hips.
Why don't I just wear a sign that says, "Too ugly to live"?
Fine, but what are you gonna hang it from, the chain or the pearls?
Neither!
I'm gonna spray paint it on my hump!
See, Blanche, you don't know any more than I do.
I've decided I'm gonna run for fashion show chairman.
You're just wasting your time.
Who is gonna vote for you?
I'm gonna win.
I don't see how that's possible.
Everybody on the committee is female.
Who are you gonna sleep with?
Are you insinuating that I cannot win it on merit alone?
All women?
Where are you going all dressed up?
Raymond invited me out for an intimate dinner.
It'll be the first time in weeks that we've been anywhere without Ma.
Is that why you sent her off to the drugstore?
You're dumping your own mother?
Faster than CBS dumped Jimmy the Greek.
Dorothy, I'm shocked at your behavior.
Me, too.
I would've done it on the first date.
I felt terrible about doing it, but Raymond and I need our privacy.
Why don't you just tell Sophia how you feel?
Itll hurt her feelings, and right now we're the only friends she has.
I think that's sweet.
I think it's unnatural, and I'm from the South.
What do you do when you and Raymond wanna, you know, make love?
- Blanche!
- Well, it's bound to come up.
- How do you handle it?
- Yeah, Dorothy, how do you handle it?
Handle it?
I can't even get close to it.
- Is it safe?
- Ma's at the drugstore.
Come in.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Okay, let's go.
I really feel so terrible about running out on Ma like that.
- I don't.
- Hey, hey!
Give it a rest, Raymond!
You're in her mouth more than her dentist.
How did you get back from the drugstore so soon?
I faked a heart attack to get through the line faster.
What's up?
Well, we, uh we were just going out to dinner.
Great.
Where are we going?
Well, Sophia, we thought maybe just this once we'd like We felt we'd like to go out for French food.
How does that sound?
They eat snails.
Why pay good money for something you can scrape off your shoes?
Well, of course, if you'd rather not come, we understand.
Don't worry about that.
I'll find something on the menu.
I just enjoy being out with you guys.
Come on.
Dorothy, I'm getting tired of dating your mother.
I promise this is the last time this'll ever happen.
- Okay.
- Coming, Ma.
- Just one more thing.
- What is it?
When we are through with dinner and she begins to pick her teeth I'll ask her to keep them in her mouth.
- This is really lovely, Raymond.
- I hoped you'd like it.
Reminds me of the place I met Charles de Gaulle.
- We were lovers, you know.
- Really?
- Ma, that's a lie.
- Who asked you?
Picture it: Sicily, 1921.
A beautiful young peasant girl saves her lira and takes a trip to Paris, the city of lights, also the only place a guy can wear a cape without getting a lot of funny looks.
She wanders into a restaurant and ends up sharing a table with a dashing young Frenchman.
They drink, they talk, they burn a cork and draw mustaches on each other.
What?
Just wanted to see if you were listening.
Anyway, the next thing she knows, it's hours later, the place is empty, and the Frenchman's got his schnoz down her blouse.
This begins a beautiful love affair.
Kids, I was that peasant girl, and the schnoz was Charles the Mole.
Charles the Mole?
Yeah, Charles the Mole.
He was the wheel man for Louie the Ice Pick.
Ma, you said Charles de Gaulle.
Yeah, right, I slept with Charles de Gaulle.
I could've been the first lady of France, but I married your father instead, a man who cleans his toenails with a shrimp fork.
romantic.
] Hey, hey, hey!
Move it along, ltzhak.
We're trying to have a conversation here.
- May I get something from the bar?
- Yes.
Bring me a bottle of scotch.
Raymond, we still have to get through dinner.
That's right.
And a bottle of gin.
Ah, dinner was just wonderful, Raymond.
And the rolls were the best I ever tasted.
You want one?
No, thank you, Sophia.
- How about some coffee?
- Sorry.
I didn't steal any.
- But I have plenty of matches.
- I meant we could make some.
Good idea.
I'll put some on.
Dorothy, I have to tell you, not being able to spend any time alone with you is driving me crazy.
I know.
Me, too.
What do you say we go away, just the two of us?
I say yes.
How about we go to the Bahamas?
All right!
Fantastic!
I gotta tell you, being with you guys is the most fun I've had in years.
You really made me forget my loneliness.
Thanks.
I can't believe it.
I'm going to the Bahamas.
Day-oh  Day-oh  Day-oh  Raymond, there is no way Ma is going with us to the Bahamas.
I promise.
I promise I'll tell her.
I hope you will.
You've been so understanding about Ma.
- I appreciate it.
- It's okay.
I respect your being so considerate of your mother.
Have you ever considered having her put away?
Every day of my life.
What are you still doing up?
- Just thinking.
- About what?
About how I'm gonna tell Ma she's not invited to the Bahamas.
What are you doing up?
Dorothy, can I confide something in you I've never told another living soul?
Of course.
- Promise not to tell anybody?
- I promise.
Are you willing to spit in each other's hand and rub on it?
Who are we, Wally and the Beaver?
What is it you wanna tell me, Rose?
I'm not absolutely sure I'm the most qualified Tinkerbelle to win the election.
Of course you are.
Why, you're the best damn Tinkerbelle I know.
Oh, girls, I just had the most disturbing dream.
What was it?
I was stranded on a desert island with Tom Selleck, Ted Danson and Steve Guttenberg.
Three men and no baby.
They kept passing me around and kissing me and powdering my behind.
So what was so disturbing?
Well, I woke up, and I'd only gotten to sleep with Steve Guttenberg.
And I'm not even sure who he is.
- What are y'all doing up?
- I just couldn't sleep.
Me neither.
I'm worried about Ma.
Oh, she didn't take the news too well about not going to the Bahamas.
Dorothy still hasn't told her.
Honey, it's been days.
What are you waiting for?
She's so thrilled, how can I tell her she's not invited?
I'm not going.
Dorothy, you're making a mistake.
Me, too.
Besides, spending all your time with Sophia isn't really helping her.
She needs to meet her own friends.
I'm not going.
She needs me.
Dorothy, please give this thing you're doing some thought.
Raymond is such a great guy.
He's been more than reasonable.
And he's the only man who hasn't dumped you after the first date in months.
Years.
I agree with everything you're trying to say, but it is not that simple.
The woman is my mother, and right now she needs my attention.
Why don't you just tell her how you feel?
She'll understand.
- You honestly think so?
- Sonia Klingenhoffer did.
She certainly did.
Thank you for pointing that out, Rose.
Good night.
You know Sonia Klingenhoffer?
Know her?
She's from St. Olaf, isn't she?
- Lovely woman.
See you.
- Wait a minute.
- Sonia's not a woman.
- I know.
She's a cow.
A pig.
A duck?
A horse.
A pencil sharpener.
Blanche, jump in.
I'm drowning.
"Sonia Klingenhoffer" is a comic strip.
And a darn good one, too.
Well, good night.
Both of you come back here, or I'll follow you to your room and act it out with sock puppets.
Okay.
You were saying?
In the first panel, it says "Sonia Klingenhoffer" in big letters, and the "O" has pigtails.
What's in the second panel, Rose?
Sonia's walking down this country road.
There's this group of children laughing at her.
In the bubble coming out of her mouth, it says, "It's not funny.
You try getting white bread and mayonnaise out of your braces".
- And then in the third panel - Rose, how many panels are there?
Sixteen.
And then in the next panel Could you just tell us the gist of the story?
Oh, fine, but then you'd miss the joke between the two crows on the telephone wire.
The gist of the story, Rose.
Well, in the last panel, Sonia tells her mother, and her mother understands.
If my foot wasn't asleep, I wouldn't ask this.
What exactly was it Sonia told her mama?
The joke between the two crows.
I knew you'd beg to hear it.
That's it.
Get out!
- But - Get out!
-  - Ow!
My nose!
Sophia, are you all right?
Wonderful, wonderful.
I always wanted to have a nose like Joe Frazier.
How long were you listening at the door?
I wasn't listening at the door.
Then why was your face pressed against the crack?
- That's what the crow said!
- Get out!
- Ma, it's me.
- Come in.
- I wanna talk to you about the trip.
- I wanna talk about the same thing.
- I'm not going.
- What?
You were right when you said I should make new friends, so I took your advice.
I met some nice people at the center, and this weekend we're all going to Cancun.
You and what's-his-name will have to go to the Bahamas without me.
You just met these people, and you're all going to Cancun?
Yeah.
One of them has a condo down there.
Ma, you were listening at the door last night, weren't you?
No, no.
I swear on your father's grave.
Or what used to be your father's grave.
Now it's a Der Wienerschnitzel.
But he always liked their pups, so I never made a fuss.
I know what you're trying to do.
It's not working.
- What?
- You made up something to do because you're afraid you'll be intruding.
You don't have to worry about that.
Honey, you are more important.
And that's why I'm spending the entire weekend here with you.
Jeez, you're a yutz.
Try not to get all choked up.
Look, Dorothy, I appreciate what you did for me, but I got my own plans now.
Okay, Ma.
Whatever you say.
Dorothy, isn't there anything I can say that'll make you change your mind?
I'm afraid not.
Look at the brochure again.
Honestly, Raymond, if I went to the Bahamas with you, I would spend the entire time worrying about my mother and frolicking gaily on sandy white beaches.
Dancing cheek to cheek under starry skies.
And sharing romantic interludes to the sound of the pounding waves.
Oh, God, I hate that wretched old woman!
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Raymond, I just can't.
My mother needs me here.
Dorothy, you are one hell of a daughter, but you're also a lousy girlfriend.
I'm sorry.
The best thing for you and me to do is not to see each other for a while, until your mother doesn't need as much of your time.
Maybe you're right.
I'll call you in a few weeks.
- Okay.
Raymond.
Hi, Dorothy.
- Hey, how did the election go?
- Don't ask.
It was a disaster.
We both lost by a landslide.
You're kidding.
Who won?
Fifi Bolger.
Can you believe that?
I think it's just because her husband's a plastic surgeon.
What does that have to do with it?
She promised everyone a discount on liposuction: Two cheeks for the price of one.
That's what swung it for Nixon in '68.
Sophia, I thought you'd be on your way to Cancun.
Me, too.
Someone was supposed to pick me up.
I can't figure out what's taking so long.
Ma, when are you going to stop?
Look, you're not going anywhere, so just put down your suitcase and you and I will go see a movie.
You go to a movie.
In a few hours, I'll be basking on a beautiful beach, trying to keep the sand out of my wrinkles.
I'll get it.
- Hello there.
- Is Sophia home?
- Hi, Duncan.
- Hi, Sophia.
The gang's waiting in the car.
I'll take your suitcase.
Ma, you're really going, aren't you?
I tried to tell you.
I thought you were lonely.
I thought you needed me.
I did, and you were there just like always.
I love you, pussycat.
But, hey, I got my own life to live.
Adios.

- What the hell are you doin' home?
I thought you had a beauty appointment.
I did.
They finished early.
On Christie Brinkley, they can finish early.
You need every minute they can spare.
Now get back there.
He's here, isn't he?
- Who?
- Who?
Rocco.
Rocco.
Let me refresh your memory.
The man you met in the police lineup.
I was there to identify the guy who stole my purse.
Rocco was there on a trumped-up charge.
Ma, they caught him on a billboard spray-painting something obscene on Spuds MacKenzie.
The dog they use in those ads is really a female.
Rocco was just making Spuds anatomically correct.
Ma, I'm telling you, the man is bad news.
He has no job.
He gambles.
What kind of future does he have?
Future?
Please.
He's 85.
The man's got so little time, he only uses the ten-items-or-less line at the supermarket.
Look who came to say hello, Rocco.
Hello, Dorothy.
Always a pleasure.
Nice seeing you.
Cut the crap and put out the stogie, Rocco.
I like your style.
Right suit, right haircut, voice a little higher, you could pass as Frank Nitti.
What the hell are you talking about?
A little higher, I think you got it.
You really knew Frank Nitti?
Well, sure.
Frank Nitti, Dutch Schultz, Al Capone.
Are you saying you were in the Mob?
I ran Detroit.
The marathon.
He ran the Detroit marathon.
Come on, come on.
We're in the middle of a hand.
Four of a kind.
Beat that.
Straight flush.
Pay me, honey.
- Ma, what are you doing?
- Losing.
It's strip poker.
That's it!
Game's over.
Who do you think you are?
Donald Trump?
You don't own this casino.
She's always telling me what to do.
My daughter treats me the same way.
Kids.
Once they're over 50, they think they know everything.
I cannot believe my mother is hanging with that cheap hood.
- You mean Rocco?
- No, Rose.
I mean Spiro Agnew.
He gave her a highway contract instead of an ID bracelet.
- Of course I mean Rocco!
- I think he's kinda cute.
He is not cute.
He is a bad influence.
Since Ma started seeing him, she's on the phone all day, stays up all night.
Yesterday, she came home with NyQuil on her breath and his surgical stockings in her pocket.
Dorothy, can I ask you something?
I don't know what it means.
I just don't like the possibilities.
No.
I wanted to ask, do you think Blanche has been picking on me lately?
I haven't noticed.
Hi, Blanche.
Must you always be so cheerful, you empty-headed Mary Poppins knockoff?
Let me know if you notice anything.
Blanche, what's with you and Rose?
I'll tell you what.
This.
- What is it?
- Rose's diary.
- What are you doing with it?
- It was lying on the table.
I picked it up, and the lock just popped open just like this.
Listen to this: "Dear Diary, I don't know how much longer "I can stand living with these two pigs.
"Moving in with them seemed like a good way "to save money, but it's getting out of hand.
"If one isn't keeping me awake with her squealing, the other one is belching in my face".
You do that sometimes, Dorothy.
After you've had a Denver omelette.
Now, you know this is a real invasion of Rose's privacy.
And it's a Spanish omelette.
- Doesn't it bother you?
- Not if I take a little Gelusil.
Oh, the diary.
No!
No!
Not at all.
And I'm really shocked that you read it.
You're not interested to hear other things she had to say?
- Not in the slightest.
- Uh-huh.
Well, fine.
Suit yourself.
Use the knife.
Blanche, what are you doing?
I thought we agreed we weren't gonna read any more.
That was only because we couldn't pry the lock off again.
And then I remembered we had these pliers in the tool drawer.
Gangway.
Old people comin' through.
Ma, what is all this stuff here?
This isn't stuff.
This is my life.
Why are you bringin' your life into our livin' room?
There have been robberies at Rocco's building.
- He asked me to store his valuables.
- We don't have enough space.
I have plenty of space in my room.
Come on, Rocco.
When you go in there, I want you to leave the door open.
Yes, Mrs. Cleaver.
Hi, girls.
Gee, what's my diary doing here next to a pair of pliers?
Whatever it is you're thinkin', it isn't true.
Good.
Then George Bush isn't married to his mother.
Boy, that was easier than I thought.
This lock has been tampered with.
You two read my diary, didn't you?
That's despicable.
I will tell you what is despicable, missy.
Some of the things you wrote.
This is my book for my eyes.
You have no right to invade my privacy.
Rose, you said some terrible things.
I thought we were friends.
We used to be.
We're not anymore.
- What's wrong?
- I have a problem.
I'll say.
You should never have stopped using that depilatory.
Ma, I'm up here.
Oh.
Ma, Rose isn't talking to me.
Enjoy it while it lasts.
Now, good night.
Honey Hi, Dorothy.
Can I talk to you?
No.
Go away.
But I can't sleep.
It's because Rose isn't talkin' to me.
I could care less.
Get out.
-  -  Sophia?
I'm not in.
Wait for the beep.
Then leave a message.
Beep.
Hi.
This is Rose.
I Rose, shut up and get in here.
Oh.
I see you're with two double-crossing ex-friends.
I'll come back later.
What do you think this is, the 7-Eleven?
I'm not open all night.
- Rose, we feel terrible.
- What have you done?
- We're really very sorry.
- Sorry about what?
- How can I ever trust you again?
- Trust who?
Let's not talk about trust after the terrible things you wrote.
- Will someone please tell me?
- Blanche and I read Rose's diary.
And she wrote some terrible things about us.
About you?
I didn't write anything about you.
I didn't even know you when I kept that diary.
What are you talking about?
That was my 4-H diary.
I kept it one summer when I raised two pigs for the county fair.
You kept a diary about raising two pigs?
You know another way to get a 4-H pig diary badge?
Oh, my God!
There's been a terrible misunderstanding.
What do you say we forget the whole thing?
No way.
I'm really mad.
It's late, I'm tired, so listen up.
You gonna tell us a story?
No.
Shadow puppets.
See?
An elephant eating a peanut.
Happy?
Of course I'm gonna tell a story.
Picture it: Morocco, the '30s.
The 1930s?
No, 30 degrees.
Do I look like Willard Scott?
Of course the 1930s.
Three close friends are haggling over a Camel.
How many humps?
None!
I'm talkin' about a cigarette.
It was the last one.
Well, anyway What does this have to do with the diary?
Suddenly I'm on Nightline.
I was just tryin' to tell a story.
There's no point, Sophia.
I'll never be able to forgive them.
Isn't there anything we can do?
No.
Absolutely not.
I'm unyielding on this.
Can't you think of anything that'll make us be friends?
No.
This time, you've crossed the line.
If I can't trust you, then we can't be friends.
The relationship is over.
Good-bye.
I got out in the hall, and I missed you guys already.
Please, let's be friends.
- Oh.
- Oh.
Oh, I love you guys.
Great.
Now get out.
Oh, let's not fight anymore.
Fine!
Get out!
The best friends I've ever had.
I said get out!
Look at all that money!
Gosh, there's thousands.
Where did this come from?
Rocco's bag.
Where did Rocco get all this money?
I don't know, but the next time we go to the Colonel, I'm getting all white meat and a biscuit.
I do not believe this.
There are thousands here.
Ma, how could Rocco have this much money?
I'm as confused as you.
He had that satchel when he went to the bank.
Sophia, maybe you better tell us exactly what happened.
When we got to the bank, he told me to keep the motor running.
Five minutes later, he ran out.
Did you think of asking why he was running?
No.
The man is taking diuretics for a prostate problem.
His whole life is a 50-yard dash.
Ma, he robbed a bank.
I'm calling the police.
No.
Wait.
He didn't rob that bank.
I know Rocco.
He's a good man.
A decent man.
An honest man.
And not a bad kisser.
How do you explain this money?
Are you a treasury agent?
It's circumstantial evidence.
Hello?
Rocco, we were talking about you.
A funny thing just happened.
We found thousands of dollars in your bag, and we were kinda wondering where it came from.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Oh, well, right.
That clears it all up.
See you later, then.
He robbed the bank.
Anybody hungry?
You're not calling the police?
The man told you he robbed a bank!
He also told me he had a good reason.
He did it for love.
Gee.
The most any man ever did for me was getting all his sheep to lie down in a field and spell out my name.
Ma, call the police.
No.
Rocco needs to talk to me.
He's coming over.
Fine.
I'll call the police.
I'll never speak to you again.
But, Sophia, Rocco did admit he robbed a bank.
It's my fault.
He thought he could keep me if he had money to buy me expensive things.
I gotta convince him to turn himself in.
If he doesn't, I'll go to the police myself.
It's the last time I let a man toy with my affections.
From now on, it's strictly physical.
Well, I've never been fond of Rocco, but it's obvious that he really cares about my mother.
Boy, one thing's for sure, that Rocco is a romantic, and there aren't many men like him left.
Blanche, what was the most romantic thing a man ever did for you?
Oh, that's easy.
When George and I were courting and it was getting to the intimate stage, we went for a date in his big old Packard.
Halfway home, we ran outta gas.
It was dark, it was cold.
So we held each other close.
Both of us knew, right then and there, this was the night.
Sure enough, pretty soon the windows were all fogged up from the heat generated by our bodies.
After we were married, I told George that the only thing that could've made that evening more romantic was if we'd had candles and wine and a big blanket.
So, on our tenth anniversary, George fired up the old Packard, and we drove along the same route, and we ran out of gas on exactly the same spot.
George said, "Blanche, why don't you look behind that tree"?
So I did, and there was a basket -  - With candles and wine and two long-stem glasses and a big blanket.
- We had a perfect evening.
-  Oh.
Oh, that is beautiful, Blanche.
Isn't it a shame you didn't look behind the tree the first time?
What's the most romantic thing a man did for you, Dorothy?
Oh, well, the most romantic thing was when Stan proposed.
He took me to a very expensive restaurant, and I went to the powder room, and when I returned, there was an open bottle of Dom Perignon and two filled glasses.
And we clinked the glasses in a toast, and Stan gave me a coy smile, and I winked at him, and then I just downed the champagne in one gulp.
And it didn't go down smoothly.
Later, Stan told me that he put my engagement ring in the bottom of the glass.
Aw.
Aw.
It turned up three days later.
Where'd it turn up, Dorothy?
On the Home Shopping Network, Rose.
But, Dorothy, you have to admit, it was very touching what Rocco did for Sophia.
If it hadn't been a felony.
Still, it goes to show you, hair may turn gray, your skin may wrinkle, but you're never too old for romance.
So, don't give up, girls.
Ssst!
Rocco.
Sophia I came to get ya.
Forget it.
You kissed this pleasure palace good-bye when you stole that money.
Come on.
I've got a brand-new Harley-Davidson in the driveway.
I didn't know you could ride a motorcycle.
Can't.
I pushed it all the way here from the dealership.
I'm exhausted.
We're gonna have to take a cab.
Hold your horses.
We got something to talk about.
First, how did you rob that bank?
Aahhh.
It was a magnificent heist.
I moved with catlike precision.
Rocco, you're in big trouble.
By tomorrow, we'll be south of the border, sparkling skies above us, tropical breezes blowing across our bodies.
Sophia, you with me?
No.
Sophia, I'm disappointed.
Not half as disappointed as I am.
I admit, at times, your stories about being a big-shot gangster seemed colorful to me, but I figured you weren't that guy anymore.
And if you are, you're not for me.
I wish you'd have told me that before.
Sophia, I have some confessions to make to you.
I was never a big-shot gangster.
I was never a big-shot nothin'.
All I was was an assistant cook at chowder house in Bayonne, New Jersey.
Not the kind of fella you're used to goin' with.
I didn't wanna lose ya.
That's why I made up the bank robbery.
$45,000 was my life savings.
I thought with that money I could I could treat you like you oughta be treated.
Like a queen.
I can't believe this.
I can't believe it either.
There's a gate.
I could've got a hernia comin' over the wall!
Wait.
I've messed everything up.
I'll just get out of your life.
What I can't believe is that you went through all this.
Rocco, you always treat me like a queen.
Come here.
Okay, Blanche.
You landed on sports.
Here's the question.
"What famous football player wore panty hose" Doug Curloff, Tampa Bay Bucs, New Year's Eve.
We were at the Holiday Inn near the airport.
The complete question is, "wore panty hose in a magazine advertisement"?
How the hell would I know?
To see a man in panty hose, I don't have to buy a magazine.
Joe Namath.
Your turn, Rose.
Okay, music history.
Here goes.
"What famous Mozart composition, "completed in 1787, is a serenade in G "for two violins, viola, cello, and double bass in four movements"?
Eine Kleine Nachtmusik.
That's right.
How did you know that?
They always play it during the chases on The Bugs Bunny-Roadrunner Show.
Oh.
There was There was this one where Elmer Fudd was chasing Bugs, and he stuck his gun down a hole that Bugs had painted Excuse me, Rose.
Blanche, could I see the rule book?
- Thank you.
- Ah!
What say we call it a night?
Ready to go to bed, Dorothy?
No.
I'm gonna wait up for Ma.
She's out with Rocco.
Oh, Dorothy, Sophia'll be fine.
She's a grown woman.
You can't wait up every night.
You're right.
She's capable of taking care of herself.
Hello?
Ma!
Do you know what time it is?
You're what?
Oh, the hell you are!
Listen, you are not spending the night at Rocco's.
Look.
As long as you live under our roof, you will abide by our rules!
I should do what to myself?
What?
Hello?
Hel Dorothy, is Is your mother all right?
Oh, fine.
She does something wrong, suddenly she's my mother.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Thank you for being a friend  Traveled down the road and back again  Your heart is true  You're a pal and a confidante  And if you threw a party  Invited everyone you knew  You would see The biggest gift would be from me  And the card attached would say  Thank you for being a friend  Oh, where is he now?
This remodeling job is never going to be finished.
Relax.
He'll be back.
Who wants him back?
He's a thief.
I haven't seen a crime like this in a garage since the St. Valentine's Day Massacre.
Ma, you did not see the St. Valentine's Day Massacre.
Oh, yeah, right.
I was at the movies that day.
All day.
Hi, ladies.
Looks nice, doesn't it?
No, Ernie.
It looks exactly as it did last week and the week before that.
When is this garage going to start looking like a guest room?
I don't know.
I was talking about my new suit.
Ernie, this is a serious matter.
We have family coming in a few weeks.
You promised it would be finished.
Mrs. Devereaux, do you want it fast, or do you want it good?
Before you answer that, Blanche, he's talking about a guest room.
If we don't start seeing results, you are out of here.
Do you know it's hard to find a good contractor?
Yes, and you're living proof.
Ernie, she didn't mean that.
She just got up on the wrong side of a cold, lonely, empty bed.
Good-looking lady like her sleeps alone?
I'm shocked.
You're letting a man with taste like that remodel our garage?
He's got us over a barrel.
I remember the last time a man had me over a barrel.
- I was at a keg party at the marina.
- We have a guest.
Hi, Al.
Hi, girls.
Pour some champagne.
We're celebrating Al's retirement.
So you finally went through with it?
Yep.
I finally called it quits at the deli.
Sold it all.
Lox, stock and barrel.
Get it?
"Lox".
He made up that joke yesterday, but it's just as funny now as it was then.
Some jokes are timeless.
So, tell me, Al, what do you intend doing with your retirement?
Well, Monday, I'm gonna sleep late.
-  What's after Monday?
- Tuesday.
Basically, I'm ready for anything.
Today is the first day of the second half of my life.
I gotta run.
I'll see you tonight.
- Bye, all.
-  Bye, Al.
Bye.
Oh, girls, I am so excited.
Now that Al's retired, we'll have so much time together.
He's pretty special to you, isn't he?
Oh, he's more than special.
I think I'm falling for him.
But then who wouldn't?
He's sensitive, he's caring.
And he thinks I'm neater than hard salami.
Did he actually tell you that, Rose?
I shouldn't have repeated it.
It was said in a moment of passion.
Okay, see you mañana, ladies.
Where are you going?
You've only been here ten minutes.
- I'll be back tomorrow.
- Ernie.
Listen to me, and listen good.
If you walk out that door now, you can forget about coming back.
I sound like I'm on Ryans Hope.
Fine.
See ya.
Dorothy, what are we gonna do now?
I don't know.
This is such a mess.
Seems to me we have two choices: One, beg Ernie's forgiveness; or two, find another contractor.
Or three, the Sicilian method: Torch the garage, collect the insurance, and build a summer house with an ocean view.
Personally, I like number three.
I'm sorry, but that's more than we're willing to spend for a guest room.
Yes, I do know the expression, "You get what you pay for".
I also know the expression, "There's a sucker born every minute".
Oh, yes, I I do know that expression, too.
That was the last contractor in the book.
I am so fed up with all of these people, I'm ready to give up.
You can't give up.
You're no quitter.
Just think of the many times you have been dumped by a man.
Did you quit dating?
No, ma'am.
You sank even lower, scraping the bottom of the barrel, facing certain humiliation.
- And why?
- Thanks, Blanche.
I get the point.
I mean it, Dorothy.
Why?
-  Hi, Rose.
- Hi.
What's wrong?
I just spent the afternoon with Al.
- What happened?
- Nothing.
All he wants to do is sit around and watch television.
That happens with people when they retire.
Maybe you should talk to him about it.
Maybe you're right.
Everybody, I found the perfect guy to convert the garage.
- Follow me.
-  Oh!
Everybody, this is Vincenzo.
Ma, who is Vincenzo?
Who he is doesn't matter.
It's who he used to be.
Thirty years ago, this man was one of Italy's foremost architects, respected the world over, creator of some of Europe's most beautiful cathedrals.
Isn't that right, Vincenzo?
Today, he's a pathetic shell of a man who spends all day looking up women's dresses.
Relax.
He doesn't speak a word of English.
Watch.
- Vincenzo?
- Eh?
You're a wrinkled old pervert, right?
Si.
But, Sophia, Vincenzo can't do all this work by himself.
He can't do any of the work.
He'll be the brains.
He'll tell me what to do in Italian, I'll tell you, you do the work.
Forget it.
We're not carpenters.
It's worth a try.
The job's already half done.
So, do I tell Vincenzo we got a deal?
Wait.
What does he want to charge us?
I'll ask him.
Vincenzo, quanto costa?
Costa?
Oh.
Gratis.
Gratis.
He says he'll do it for nothing.
He likes getting away from the center, he likes working, and he likes being in the company of pretty young girls.
- Oh, well.
- Oh.
Since he puts it that way, how can we refuse?
- It's a deal.
- Good.
Here's a list of the pretty young girls he wants.
- Hi, Al.
- Rose, you look beautiful.
Oh.
Thank you.
I know we're just going to the movies, but I felt like dressing up.
About the movies, would you mind if we didn't go?
Well, no.
What do you feel like doing?
We'll do what we did last night.
- We didn't do anything.
- Sounds good to me.
Al, we have to talk.
Can't it wait till after Moonlighting?
There's a special episode on tonight.
It's only been rerun three times.
Al, what has gotten into you lately?
Before you retired, you were the most active man I ever knew.
I had to run to keep up with you.
Now you're nothing but a couch potato.
You should do more.
You've earned it.
Isn't there one thing you've always dreamed of doing?
- I always dreamed of retiring.
-  I just don't want you to wake up one day and think that you've missed the opportunity to do something great.
Rose, it sounds like you're maybe just bored with me.
Let's take a rain check on tonight, okay?
I'm feeling kind of tired anyway.
I'll call you tomorrow.
Al?
Al?
Damn.
Before we begin -  - Let's make one thing clear:  I am in charge.
-  - I am the boss.
-  - I am the master.
-  - I am the walrus.
Ma, either your Italian is rusty, or he's the world's oldest hippie.
Can we just get started, please?
First we must inspect the workers.
Ah, ah.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Aha.
Ow!
- He pinched me.
- It's a reflex.
He's Italian.
Oh  We'll start with the simplest of jobs.
- Installing the window.
- Dorothy  Dorothy, you hold the window in place.
Rosa  Rose will do the hammering.
Blanche  Blanche, you'll do the screwing.
He came up with that one on his own.
I swear.
Drill a toggle bolt, anchor with a 5/16th bit, and miter-cut the quarter-inch plywood after you attach the studs.
Eh.
Only thing I recognized in there was "studs".
- This isn't gonna work.
- No, no.
- È impossibile.
- Si, è impossibile.
Vincenzo has a wonderful idea.
He'll bring his crew to finish the job at no additional charge.
Why would he do it for free?
Because he's senile as a doorknob, and stop asking questions.
Hi, everybody.
Al, what are you doing here?
I did a lot of thinking about what you said, and you were right.
I've been wasting my life.
I'm so glad you feel that way.
There is one dream I used to have: Sailing around the world.
Like you said, what better time to follow my dream than during my retirement.
I'm gonna do it.
You booked yourself on a cruise.
Better.
I bought my own boat and hired a crew.
- You what?
- It cost me my life savings, but I don't care.
I'm gonna sail around the world, and it's all because of you.
And I want you to come along with me.
Rose, what are you doing?
It is 2:00 a.m. I couldn't sleep, so I decided to get up and make a batch of sperhoven krispies.
It's an ancient Scandinavian midnight snack.
I guess after a night of pillaging and raping, a Viking wants a little something to go with his cocoa.
Well, they smell god-awful.
Yeah.
When you're about to throw up from the stench, that's when they're done.
Who wants some?
If these had been offered to the Donner Party, they still would have eaten each other.
Don't be silly, Dorothy.
They're delicious.
You just have to know how to eat them.
You hold your nose with one hand and pop a krispie in your mouth with the other.
Mm-mm!
That tastes like cheesecake, fresh strawberries and chocolate ice cream.
Mm.
My gosh, you're right.
That is the best thing I have ever tasted.
Oh, this is delicious.
-  Mmm.
-  Mm-hmm.
Hey, give me a break.
You can't smell that from the hall.
Sophia Rose has been cookin'.
Yeah, and it turned out perfect!
But I'm still upset.
Because you don't know what to do about Al?
No, she's upset because Jimmy Swaggart can't cover his motel bill.
Of course I'm upset.
I don't know what to do.
I know what I'd say if a man asked me to sail around the world.
Please.
You can't get anybody to ask you out for coffee.
Sail around the world.
That'll be the day.
Like there's a line waiting around the block.
We'll have to install a ticket machine like they have at the bakery.
I get the picture, Ma!
I'm afraid I'm responsible for making Al do something he really doesn't want to do.
So what?
Maybe you are responsible, but it got him off his duff.
- What's wrong with that?
- The best thing for him.
And the best thing for you, Rose.
Have you even considered taking him up on his offer?
Oh, no.
I couldn't.
I have responsibilities.
Rose, haven't you ever done anything just wild and crazy and impetuous?
No.
I'm from St. Olaf.
We're forced to sign a pledge when we're 15 that we won't do any of those things.
It keeps people from painting their houses silly colors.
I don't know what to do.
I'm gonna have to sleep on it.
"Sleep on it".
Men.
Sex.
I listen to your sexual problems.
How about my sexual problems?
What is your sexual problem?
I don't get any.
And I read in a magazine where a woman is at her sexual peak at 83.
Sophia, I read that same article.
It was 33.
Really?
Then all those feelings I've been having lately must be colitis.
Sorry I interrupted.
Good night.
Here they are, Dorothy.
Vincenzo's new work crew.
Looks like the road company of Cocoon.
Have a little respect.
These are all masters of their crafts.
Hi, girls.
Who are these old men?
The Osmond Brothers, Rose.
The years without Donny have not been kind to them.
- These are Vincenzo's friends.
- Oh, that's right.
I forgot.
I've had so much on my mind lately.
Have you decided what to do about Al?
No.
I'm just as confused as ever.
Rosa  Vincenzo thinks he has a solution to your problem.
Really?
Well, translate for me, Sophia.
Well, I'm a little bit rusty, but I think he said, "Picture it: Sicily 1939.
"The war is on.
"A promising young architect is offered a job to spearhead construction of a new wing at the Vatican".
Wait, Ma.
You say your Italian is rusty, but you know the word for "spearhead"?
It was my brother's nickname for a while as a child.
Anyway, the young man is torn.
Taking the train to Rome means running the risk of enemy bombs.
But staying home means passing up a chance to make history!
He certainly packs a lot of meaning into a few words.
Aw, shut up!
In the end, he chooses safety.
It's a decision he still regrets half a century later.
His conclusion: Life without risk is no life at all.
Sophia, tell Vincenzo that's a wonderful story.
Tell him he helped me make the most important decision of my life.
I'm gonna call Al and tell him I'll sail around the world with him.
Sophia, did Vincenzo really say all that?
Of course not.
He's a carpenter.
I'm a philosopher.
He said he wants everyone out of the garage until the work is completed.
But why?
Because to an old guy with cataracts, you two look like Swedish stewardesses.
Old age can play a lot of cruel jokes.
Come on.
Thanks for leaving me in the parking lot.
It's not like unsavory, swarthy characters hang around the docks by night.
Oh, Ma, there's nobody here like that.
I know, but I gave it a minute.
I thought I'd line something up for you for sayurday.
Ahoy, girls.
Welcome aboard.
You must be so excited!
Oh, I sure am.
Grab some champagne.
I'm gonna find Al.
I haven't seen him.
I want to say thanks.
-  I love champagne.
-  Me, too.
The only problem is, after a few glasses, I'll kiss any man in sight.
Man overboard!
That was just a coincidence, Dorothy.
Hey, Al.
I've been looking all over for you.
Really?
I don't think I've moved from this spot.
There's something I have to tell you.
Oh, please, Al.
There's something I want to say first.
I want you to know that I am so excited about going on this trip.
And I'm so happy that you chose me for this adventure.
I love you, Al, and I'm ready to go anywhere with you.
And the North Star can be our guide.
I love you, too, Rose, but that's not the North Star.
That's the tower of the all-Spanish radio station.
Fine.
Much more reliable.
And it doesn't disappear in the daylight.
Rose, I think I'm gonna puke.
It was just a little joke, Al.
I laugh at all yours.
No, I'm serious.
I'm seasick.
You mean it?
We're still docked.
I can't sail around the world.
I guess there's no adventure in me.
I'm sorry.
Well, don't be sorry.
Look what you were about to do what we were both about to do.
We got on the ship.
Most people never even leave shore.
- You mean that?
- Of course I do.
You and I still have a lot of adventures left in us, so many things we haven't tried.
Have you ever been to Space Mountain at Disney World?
Imagine it, Al.
We'd go rocketing up and down, and turn and turn and turn.
Then, zoom, plummet right back down.
And Or we could walk around and get our picture taken with Goofy.
Hi, girls.
How do I look?
Where are you going all dolled up?
Al and I are taking a picnic to hear the philharmonic.
I didn't know Al was a music lover.
He isn't.
He likes to see what picnic meats are popular this season.
Vincenzo says he's finished.
He wants us to take a look.
Ohhh!
Fine.
-  I don't believe it.
-  This is terrible.
I'll admit, it's a little drab, but with some plants and nice It's a garage, you twit!
Ma, how did this happen?
Vincenzo   Sophia  It was a slight misunderstanding.
In Sicily, every region has its own dialect.
Actually, every town has its own dialect.
Actually, every household has its own dialect.
This also explains why the Italian army is as effective as a Jamaican bobsled team.
He's sorry he made the mistake.
He'll be glad to turn this back into a bedroom.
No.
No, please.
I could not live through that again.
Thank him for his work, and say he must be proud.
Grazie, Vincenzo.
Mi figlia, Dorothy.
Dorothy!
Ma I think I accidentally promised your hand in marriage.
Si.
Dorothy.
Well, at least he's Italian.
Dorothy Dorothy Dorothy

I'm panting, Dorothy.
Is the UPS man wearing his tight overalls again?
Stop the watch.
What is going on?
Why are you guys on this sudden exercise kick?
The Harlan twins asked Rose and me to spend next weekend with them.
Cruising in the Bahamas.
Oh.
So you're trying to lose weight.
More than lose weight.
We're giving ourselves a total makeover.
I'm in charge of fitness.
Blanche, beauty.
Who's in charge of distracting the twins while the two of you have your swimsuits on?
There's my ride.
I'm off to Epcot.
Wait.
Ma, where's your overnight bag?
Bag?
We get on the bus, play cards till we get there, sleep in a motel, we come back.
You go to Epcot and never look at the exhibits?
Please.
I'm 82 years old.
I'm interested in technology in the year 2000?
Hasta luego.
As long as we're resting, we might as well take measurements.
Do me first.
One thing I know for sure, I have not lost my hourglass figure.
But it looks like somebody poured about 90 minutes of extra sand in the glass.
You're just jealous, Dorothy.
You know it, I know it, Rose knows it.
It's neat the way the tape's a different color at this end.
I haven't had this much off the spool since I measured the couch for slipcovers.
Ma must have forgotten something.
Hi, Ma.
Surprise.
Michael!
What are you doing here?
- Hello, Michael.
- Hi, Michael.
I was with the band up in Ft.
Lauderdale.
I thought I'd swing by.
It's a shame you missed Sophia.
She just left.
She'll be back tomorrow.
Sit down.
Tell me, what is new?
Well, to be honest, Mom, a lot.
I'm getting married.
Michael, that's wonderful.
Of course.
Of course, Michael.
It's wonderful.
It's just kind of sudden.
I know it seems sudden.
Lorraine is her name.
She sings with the band.
We've only been going out four months, but I've never been so sure of anything in my life.
Mom, she's the one.
I'm really happy for you.
So, Michael, when do we get to meet Lorraine?
Tomorrow.
If that's okay.
I already invited her.
She's with her family in Miami Beach.
We thought we'd get the two families together Sunday.
Terrific idea.
I can't wait to meet her.
There is something about her you should know.
Lorraine is kind of black.
Kind of black.
What does that mean, kind of black?
That's, uh That's like being kind of Spanish.
You know, either you are or you aren't.
- She is.
- Oh, God.
Emilio Estevez is kind of Spanish, Dorothy.
Thank you, Rose.
Mom, you're not upset about this, are you?
No.
I'm not upset.
It's just that Come on.
It's an awful lot to digest at once.
First you surprise me, and then the engagement.
And then Lorraine.
I really love her, Mom.
Then Then that's all that matters.
I mean it.
I'm very happy for you.
Now, come on.
Let's take your things inside.
You know, Dorothy, I just thought of something.
Lorraine's family's gonna be black, too, aren't they?
Yes, Rose.
You could probably make them feel welcome if you do your version of that dance the Huxtables do at the beginning of The Cosby Show.
How much longer do I have to have this hot towel on?
Just be patient, Rose.
When you remove this towel, you are gonna see what a dramatic difference Blanche's miracle beauty treatment has made already.
Honey, you will be transformed into a totally new woman.
- You ready?
- Uh-huh.
All right.
One, two, three!
Oh, my God.
I look horrible.
Oh, Dorothy, it's you.
I'm sorry, Rose.
I'm sorry.
I forgot it was a full moon.
Are Michael and Lorraine here yet?
No, but they should be any minute.
- You seem a little nervous.
- Oh, I am.
Are you nervous 'cause you haven't met Michael's fiancée?
No, Rose.
I'm nervous because if Sonny Bono gets elected mayor of Palm Springs, he's gonna make all the postmen wear leather bell-bottoms and a fur vest.
If you're nervous about meeting Lorraine, just think how nervous she must be.
I know.
I'll never forget when I first met Stan's mother.
Can I ask a dumb question?
Better than anyone I know.
What color is black people's dandruff?
Rose, black people don't have dandruff.
God figures they've been through enough already.
Hello.
You must be Michael's mother.
And you must be Lorraine's mother.
We weren't expecting you until tomorrow.
What do you think, Ma?
Is she beautiful?
Ooh, wow.
He's really getting along great with his future mother-in-law.
Rose, that's Lorraine, you idiot.
Lorraine, I'm terribly sorry.
That's all right.
A lot of people are confused by the age difference.
You see, I am 44 years old.
Wow.
This is great.
I was afraid we wouldn't have anything in common.
We're almost the same age.
Rose, you make her sound like an old woman.
Actually, she's much closer to my age.
Lorraine, these are my roommates.
That's Blanche Devereaux, Rose Nylund.
- Michael tells us you're a singer.
- That's right.
- I bet you know all the great oldies.
- Rose.
Why don't I show you where to put your things.
- Thank you.
Thank you, Blanche.
- Okay.
Mm-hmm.
- Rose, will you excuse us?
- Sure.
Where you going?
Nowhere.
Get out.
Mom, is something wrong?
No.
Absolutely nothing.
Except I can't imagine why you never mentioned how much older Lorraine is.
- It slipped my mind.
- Slipped your mind?
Michael, she's twice your age.
You're making a big deal out of this.
What about what you said last night?
Only one thing matters: If two people love each other.
- This is different.
- What makes it different?
You're my son.
I don't want to see you make a big mistake.
You're saying you think this is a big mistake?
I'm not sure what I'm saying.
For someone who's not sure what she's saying, you're saying a lot.
I'm beginning to think the big mistake was coming here.
Dorothy, I thought you went to bed.
Can't sleep.
I just lie awake thinking about Michael and Lorraine.
Dorothy, just a word of caution.
I almost lost my Becky when I stuck my nose into her business.
- It is not worth it.
- Blanche is right.
The same thing happened to the Vikbotters back in St. Olaf.
You see, Gretchen had this thing for Buddy, but Mr. Vikbotter didn't approve.
He did his best to keep them apart.
But one day he came home early and he found Gretchen and Buddy in How will I say it?
A most indelicate situation.
- What did he do?
- He yelled at them to stop, but they wouldn't, so he turned the hose on them.
He turned the hose on them?
They were in the front yard.
- Oh!
-  Wait.
Wait a minute, Rose.
Buddy and Gretchen weren't people, were they?
Of course not.
They were dogs.
Gretchen was a Dalmatian, and Buddy was a schnauzer.
And Mr. Vikbotter wasn't too happy when he ended up with a litter of schnalmations.
You know, Rose, sometimes I wish somebody had turned the hose on your parents.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Am I interrupting?
Not at all.
Rose and I were just about to see if we can fit into our bathing suits yet.
Blanche says we might have better luck if we sprayed our fannies with Pam.
I'd forgotten how cool it gets here this time of year.
No, you picked the right time to visit.
Another month it would be very humid.
You don't know humid until you've been in St. Louis in mid-August.
I hear it gets very, very humid there.
Especially in mid-August.
It's incredibly humid.
It's hot, sticky.
Why are you marrying my son?
I'm glad one of us finally brought that up.
Dorothy, I don't blame you for having your doubts.
I have more than doubts.
I look at the two of you, I see so many differences.
He is 23.
You are 44.
He's white.
You're black.
- He is 23.
You are 44.
- You said that already.
I'm sorry.
I just can't seem to get past that one.
Look, Dorothy, let me tell you something about myself.
When I was 18, I was married to the boy next door.
All my family and friends, they thought we were the perfect couple.
Well, we stayed married for 20 years, but I don't think we were ever in love.
It just seemed as though we should be.
And I learned something from that.
It doesn't matter what anybody thinks.
It's how you feel about each other.
Am I making any sense?
You're making a lot of sense.
I was married to a boy next door once myself.
We have your blessing?
I'd like to say yes, but I can't.
Everything you've said is logical.
But I'm a mother, and a mother doesn't have to be logical.
I'm awfully sorry.
I just don't approve.
I'm sorry you feel that way.
I can't believe you feel this way.
Lorraine's mother is not concerned about our age difference.
She's entitled to her opinion.
You are being very small-minded.
A wise philosopher once said, "There are no small minds, just big heads".
- What does that mean?
- I'm not sure.
Come to think of it, it wasn't a philosopher.
It was Rose.
You are impossible.
Hello.
We're a little early.
I'm Greta Wagner, and these are my sisters, Trudy and Libby.
I'm so sorry.
The house is such a mess.
Why, it's neater than our maid ever gets ours.
I'd hire you anytime.
- Mama.
- Baby.
- How are you?
- I'm fine.
How y'all doing?
Hi, baby.
- Have you met Dorothy?
- Actually, they haven't.
And you must be Michael's parents.
Mama, put your glasses on.
Oh, my Lord.
This is mud on our faces.
We're not really black.
Mama, Aunt Trudy, Aunt Libby, this is Blanche Devereaux.
- Hello.
- This is Rose Nylund.
And this is Michael's mother, Dorothy.
And this is Michael.
- This is Michael?
- Yes.
Uh-huh.
Mama, we talked about this.
I told you he was younger.
Yes, but you sure didn't tell me he was white.
No daughter of mine is marrying some skinny white boy.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Who are you calling a skinny white boy?
I think she meant Michael.
You got that right.
- Oh, it was easy.
- Oh, shut up, Rose.
Mrs. Wagner, I'm not thrilled about my son marrying your daughter either.
Oh, yeah?
Why?
You got something against black people?
Of course not, and I resent the insinuation.
We firmly believe that all men are created equal.
That's a bunch of baloney.
Rose.
If you don't believe me, just turn on your television and watch a white person dance down the line on Soul Train.
Race is not even an issue.
Your daughter is twice my son's age.
What can a women in her 40s possibly have in common with a boy in his 20s?
Sex.
At 20, a man is at his peak, and a woman in her 40s is also at her peak.
When the two come together, hot damn!
Lorraine, if you want a young man, fine.
Just make it a young black man.
Why, I could name ten fine, rich, young black men off the top of my head.
Wait just a minute till I get a pencil.
Mama, I love Michael.
I don't care about his color.
Honey, it's just a phase.
Ever since Diana Ross started marrying white men, everyone's got to have one.
What is this, a revival of Raisin in the Sun?
Grandma, this is my fiancée, Lorraine, and this is her mother and two aunts.
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
- This is your fiancée?
- Yeah, that's right.
You couldn't find someone your own age?
- What is that supposed to mean?
- No offense.
But your daughter looks like she's been around the block more times than the Good Humor Man.
Hold my purse.
Those are fighting words.
Stop it, all of you.
What difference does it make that Lorraine's a little long in the tooth and Michael's a skinny white boy?
Can't you see they love each other?
We should be celebrating, not arguing whether or not it's right.
Now, what do you say we all join hands and sing a chorus of "Abraham, Martin, and John".
Is she for real?
Yep.
Frightening, isn't it?
Lorraine and I are getting married, and that's final.
Lorraine, you marry him, and you'll regret it for the rest of your life.
Come on, girls.
Michael, you're making a very big mistake.
It's my life, Mom.
We can't let them go through with it.
They're adults.
Adults can do whatever they want to.
Not necessarily.
Adults aren't allowed to ride the little horsey in front of the A&P.
Dorothy, what are you still doing up?
Oh, I couldn't sleep, so I thought I'd watch a little TV to unwind, take my mind off my troubles.
- What are you watching?
- Judgment at Nuremberg.
Rose, do you think I did the right thing?
Well, sure, if you don't care how the movie ends.
I meant about Michael and Lorraine.
- Oh.
- What's going on?
Oh, Dorothy's upset about Michael and Lorraine.
Really?
How would you feel if your son were marrying an older woman?
When my son was five years old, he nearly burned down our whole town.
Since then, nothing he does upsets me.
Hell, he could marry Lillian Gish, and I wouldn't care.
I hope we didn't wake you.
My sisters and I couldn't sleep.
We felt terrible about the things we said to you.
We didn't agree on much of anything, did we?
Look, neither one of us wants this marriage to happen.
So instead of fighting, why don't we try to figure a way out of this mess.
- You like cheesecake?
- Can Ella shatter glass?
This cheesecake is delicious.
It's not bad for store-bought.
I'd love another cup of coffee.
- I will put on another pot.
- Good.
What's all the racket?
Oh, Martha and the Vandellas are back.
- Ma!
- It's all right, Dorothy.
- I've got one at home just like her.
- You have one, too?
One at home?
What am I, a cocker spaniel?
Why don't you just give me an old sock to chew on?
I'm glad you showed up.
There's something important we didn't discuss this afternoon, and I'd like to get that cleared up.
What is it?
Is it true what they say about black men in bed?
Oh, yes, definitely.
Oh, yes, definitely that is something I would like to know about, too.
Blanche, please, that's a stereotype.
Call it whatever you want.
I'm just grateful it's true.
Oh, isn't it great the way we're all getting along?
And Michael and Lorraine didn't have to elope after all.
-  - What did you say, Rose?
Elope?
Oh, no.
I promised I wouldn't tell.
Rose.
I ran into them when they were leaving.
They were heading for the wedding chapel on Pompano Drive.
- I know exactly where it is.
- I'm right behind you.
Come on.
Come on.
Excuse me.
Did a white man and an old black woman come in here?
She meant a regal black woman and a scuzzy little white boy.
Mom, what are you all doing here?
- Stopping you.
-  What?
- I forbid you to get married.
- Same goes for me.
Lorraine, he's not good enough for you.
You can do better.
When's the last time you took a good look at the merchandise you're trying to move?
We both love you very much, but we also love each other.
Now, we're getting married.
If you can't deal with that, you don't have to see us.
But that means you also won't get to see your grandchild.
Say what?
I'm pregnant.
Greta, can I talk to you for a minute?
I was gonna ask you the same thing.
They're going to get married whether we like it or not.
- Do you like it?
- No.
They're also going to have a baby whether we like it or not.
- Do you wanna see it?
- Yes.
Me, too.
So what are we gonna do?
Oh.
What mothers have done since the beginning of time.
Pretend that we're happy, and then complain to anybody who'll listen.
- Michael, congratulations.
- Congratulations, Lorraine.
Is the Zbornak-Wagner party ready?
- Yeah.
- I think we are.
Wait a minute.
Lorraine has to have something old and something new and something borrowed and something blue.
- Oh!
- This is blue.
- Thanks, Mama.
- These earrings are old.
- They were my grandmother's.
- Thank you.
Here.
I borrowed these knee-high surgical stockings on the bus.
Ma!
- Here, Lorraine.
- Oh, thank you.
That's everything but the new.
Oh, Michael gave me that.
Let's go.
Oh!
I can't believe it.
A grandchild.
- Little Roger.
- Roger?
What do you want him to be, a choreographer?
It's Lamar.
Lamar Zbornak.
Why don't we just pin a "kick me" sign on the kid?
It's Roger.
Lamar.
- Roger.
- Lamar.
- Roger.
- Lamar.
Fabulous.
I'm looking forward to Thanksgiving already.
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
Thank you for being a friend  Traveled down the road and back again  Your heart is true  You're a pal and a confidante  And if you threw a party  Invited everyone you knew  You would see The biggest gift would be from me  And the card attached would say  Thank you for being a friend  - Hi, Ma.
- How'd the interview go?
Terrific.
I have my choice of summer jobs.
Three interviews this week, three offers.
That's because you're showing more leg like I told you.
I don't think the woman at the agency was interested in my legs.
Grow up.
Don't you watch TV?
Are switch-hitters.
Ma, TV soap operas aren't real life.
I'm not talking characters.
I'm talking actresses.
Pick up an Enquirer sometime.
You'll learn something.
I am exhausted.
I have spent this entire day bed-shopping.
Have you no shame?
Bed-hopping nowadays is sexually irresponsible.
Not bed-hopping, Ma.
Bed-shopping.
Yeah, right.
Nice cover.
It's true.
I need a new bed.
My old one is falling apart.
The prices are outrageous.
The bed I wanted cost more than the down payment on my first house.
In Sicily, beds were dirt-cheap.
Of course it was because you slept on dirt.
If my name were Mark Twain, you'd be writing this stuff down.
Girls, you won't believe what happened to me this afternoon.
I met Mister Terrific!
Rose, don't be so quick to judge.
I once thought I met Mr. Terrific.
Turned out there was also a Mrs. Terrific.
I found myself ducking a Mr. Vase.
You don't understand.
I really met Mister Terrific at the mall.
He was signing autographs in an empty storefront that used to be Jack Kemp's campaign headquarters.
- Rose, he's wearing a cape.
- And a mask.
He's wearing a cape and a mask.
Wait a minute.
Is this guy an insurance salesman named Marshall Herskovitz?
That's his costume.
Don't tell me you've never heard of Mister Terrific.
Mister Terrific's Clubhouse?
Every weekday afternoon, one full hour on Saturdays?
- That clown with the kiddie show?
- He's not a clown.
He's a superhero.
You're thinking of Bozo.
I'm talking to Bozo.
Wait.
What's this here?
"To the fairest Rose I've seen until tonight.
Mister Terrific"?
He asked me out.
We're going to dinner.
Can you believe it?
No.
Actually not.
You spent 30 seconds getting an autograph.
You don't know the guy.
Dorothy, he's a television celebrity.
Besides, I talked to him for over an hour.
There weren't too many people in line.
A Mr. Whipple look-alike was next door demonstrating the new three-ply toilet tissue.
I better get ready.
He's picking me up at 7:00.
Can you imagine making a date with a guy you met at a mall?
Pretty strange.
I'll say.
She didn't even know what kind of car he drives.
Oh, Sophia, did they deliver my new bed?
- They were here all day setting it up.
- All day?
For that simple bed?
Simple?
I haven't seen so much brass since the brass-knuckle RV show at the Palermo Hilton.
I don't believe it.
They delivered the wrong bed.
- Blanche, do you think - Not now.
- What's her hurry?
- That enormous thing in her bedroom.
I thought she'd stopped seeing Roger.
How do I look?
Not bad.
You got another date with Captain Marvelous?
Mister Terrific.
You didn't read many comic books when you were a child.
We had comic books in Sicily.
My favorite was Benito the Hood.
He lived in the forest with his band of merry thugs.
Benito was very popular.
He stole from the rich and gave to the poor?
I said Benito the Hood, not Benito the Idiot.
He stole from everyone and kept it for himself.
Didn't even share it with his band of merry thugs.
He was the idol of many a Sicilian youngster.
That's what they did all right.
Delivered the wrong bed.
- You don't like this one?
- Oh, I think it's stunning.
I absolutely love it, but I can't afford it.
That bed back there must cost exactly what I paid for the one I ordered.
They made a mistake.
They charged me for the inexpensive bed.
Merry Christmas from Neiman-Marcus.
Sophia, she can't keep that bed.
That'd be like stealing.
It's only stealing if they find out.
The bed's in my bedroom.
Who's gonna know?
Everyone who knows the bunt sign on the New York Yankees.
Look, everyone.
Mister Terrific.
Rose, please.
You're embarrassing me.
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's just I get such a kick out of your slogan.
That's a slogan?
"Look, everyone.
Mister Terrific"?
Twenty-two years next fall.
You must be Sophia.
I'm Blanche Devereaux.
A pleasure to finally meet you.
Oh!
You watch the show?
Why?
I already know how to brush my teeth.
Good for you.
Then you won't be rounded up by the Cavity Cops.
Oh.
Dorothy, I'm glad you're here.
Meet Mister Terrific.
Oh, Mister Terrific, meet Mrs. Severely Depressed.
Dorothy, what's wrong?
- I found out my great job at the camp.
Head of Arts and Crafts.
I'll be spending the entire summer gluing macaroni to construction paper.
Dorothy's a high school teacher looking for summer work.
Really?
I might be able to help you out.
My producer's been looking for someone with education credentials to act as a consultant on the show.
It sounds like it could be interesting.
Oh, I doubt it.
The only really interesting job on the show is being me.
But I'll be glad to see what I can do.
Rose, we better get going.
If you can do anything to help, it would be really Terrific?
Nice meeting you.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye and thank you.
Don't count on that job, Dorothy.
Many women have had their hopes dashed by smooth-talking TV sharpies.
Dave Garroway told me if I treated him right, I'd be his sidekick on the Today Show.
I said no and he ended up with a monkey.
Draw your own conclusions.
T-E-double-R-l-F-l-C  Shove a "Mr." in the front And you've got me  Okay, boys and girls, it's time to learn about our special word.
Kolak!
Tell us what today's special word is.
Splotnick.
The word for today is "hot".
"Hot" has a lot of meanings, boys and girls.
Coffee is hot.
A stove is hot.
Angie Dickinson is hot.
Very funny, Mr. Stage Manager.
And now, boys and girls, we're going to  Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
My My super-terrific hearing detects a visitor.
It's Mr. Policeman!
Disguised as Mr. Mailman.
Why?
Why?
Why don't I find out why while you boys and girls watch another very special adventure of Ricky the Flying Turtle.
See you in a few minutes.
Clear!
Freddy.
It's been 16 years.
When are you going to learn?
Tuesday, it's Mr. Policeman.
Thursday, it's Mr. Mailman.
And he wonders why he can't have his own series.
Dorothy, I read your memo.
I like the way you think.
Well, thank you, Mr. Hastings.
Thank you.
You've got modern ideas for a woman your age.
You're just saying that.
No.
No.
I mean it.
I really think you're old.
Dorothy, how's the show going?
Terrible.
But better than Thirtysomething.
Five, four, three, two.
Wasn't that fun, boys and girls?
Twylar.
Kolak says that I have to return to my home planet of Twylar immediately!
So we'll just say good-bye this time, until next time, boys and girls, when you turn on your TV sets and hear  Look, everyone!
Mister Terrific!
-  organ.
] -  Clear!
Hi, Rose.
Let me change capes and we'll be on our way.
- In my office, Terrific, now.
- Say "please," Mr. Producer.
Little twerp.
He was on my show when he was five.
He sat on my lap and peed on me.
I guess old habits die hard.
Why don't I go back with Dorothy and you can stop by when you're finished.
- You're a terrific lady, Rose Nylund.
- Thank you.
How come you're not wearing the Terrific Lady button I got?
Ooh, sorry.
Yes.
Right.
- I'm nuts about that guy.
- You'd have to be.
But it's so strange.
You have no idea what it's like dating a superhero.
Sure I can.
Why, my Stan and Superman had a lot in common.
They were both faster than a speeding bullet.
I haven't had a decent night's sleep in weeks.
Every time I climb into bed, I feel guilty.
Take down the video equipment.
I'm talking about the brass bed.
I shouldn't have kept it.
- Rose was right.
It's like stealing.
- Call the store and return it.
I've had it over three weeks.
They won't take it back.
How much wear can you give a bed in just three weeks?
I see your point.
Hi.
I thought you had a date with Mister Terrific.
He'll be over.
The producer had to have an important meeting with him.
I have a feeling it was to discuss the recommendations that I made.
I hope you recommended he do some exercise.
A man shouldn't wear tights unless he's got a butt like Baryshnikov.
-  - There he is.
Dorothy, what do you think I oughta do with my bed?
Put it in the Smithsonian, Blanche.
It has more miles on it than the Spirit of St. Louis.
I am serious.
What do you think?
You know the difference between right and wrong.
Please.
In bed, she only knows the difference between right and left.
Honey, why are you still wearing your costume?
- I couldn't wait to get out of there.
- Why?
What happened?
They fired me!
And it's all her fault!
Fired you?
How could they fire Mister Terrific?
How?
I'll tell you how.
The newly hired amateur consultant had a few recommendations on how to improve my show.
They were only suggestions ideas that I thought would help the show.
Oh, like changing the theme song?
Well, I mean, frankly, the lyrics are a bit inane.
- I wrote those lyrics.
- How did Dorothy get you fired?
They loved her ideas.
They said I should use them.
I said no.
They said, "You're fired".
It was never my intention for this to happen.
I'll go in the morning and talk to him.
Don't worry.
If Dorothy says she'll get your job back, that's exactly what she's gonna do.
I guess it's worth a shot.
Here's where you can reach me.
Call me if you can work things out.
- I'll be there until show time.
- Fine.
- One more thing.
- What's that?
Leave by the back door.
Mr. Hastings, I need to speak with you.
I've got a show to air and no star.
- Find him yet?
- I know where Mister Terrific is.
Not Mister Terrific.
Mr. Mailman.
He's our guest host, but he's disappeared.
Oh, uh, try the ladies room.
I found him there once when he was playing Mrs. Nurse.
- I didn't know we had a Mrs. Nurse.
- We don't.
Mr. Hastings, when I made those recommendations, I never intended for you to fire Mister Terrific.
- I was merely - The guy is history.
People don't want that kind of show anymore.
- But the public loves him.
- The numbers say different.
- I found him.
- Great.
You got two minutes.
I'm not going on.
No one can replace Mister Terrific.
You can say good-bye to Mr. Policeman.
It's Thursday.
I thought he was supposed to be Mr. Mailman.
- What do we do now?
- Your star is a phone call away.
Give me the word, and Mister Terrific will be back.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
I think I've got a better idea.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Your friend couldn't work things out.
- There's still time.
I think my time has passed, Rose.
Twenty-two years, I've been Mister Terrific.
Twenty-two years!
I was doing weekend weather forecast when I turned an old blanket into a cape and created Mister Terrific.
Kolak the puppet?
I made him from a sock.
Ten minutes before airtime.
It was an argyle.
Back in those days, Kolak used to be from Scotland.
Everything about that show came from inside my head.
- And off your foot.
-  Kids started tuning in in droves.
The critics called me the next Captain Kangaroo.
Mr. Green Jeans sent me a fan letter.
I'm not going to let it end like this.
I can't believe my fans would want it this way.
Dorothy won't let you down.
I'll bet she's on her way to a phone.
So I'm Mrs. Schoolteacher.
And I'm going to be your friend just for today.
Of course Kolak from Twylar will also be here.
Later.
Where are you going?
Back to the studio.
There's only one thing left to do.
Who was that nut?
I don't know.
Mister Terrific usually comes in alone.
So you see, it's very important that we eat lots of fruits and grains and try to avoid sweets.
- Right, Kolak?
- Why don't you try to avoid sweets?
It's not a pretty picture from down here.
Why, Kolak, I didn't know that you could speak English.
What you don't know could fill a space the size of Guam.
Since you've brought up Guam, why don't we talk about geography for a little bit.
You wanna see some geography, lady?
I'll show you geography.
Whoa, Kolak!
You know what we call this on the planet Twylar, huh?
Oh, Mrs. Schoolteacher, like that's really gonna shut me up.
What'll we do now?
Why don't you tell the boys and girls how you gave Mister Terrific the ax?
A cartoon.
A cartoon.
That's right.
Here we go.
- You're clear!
- That's it.
I'm finished.
Dorothy, calm down.
Things are going very well.
Very well?
They were trying to kill me.
They want Mister Terrific back, and so do I. Dorothy, how could you?
I thought you were my friend.
I am, Rose.
It just happened so fast.
They were pushing me out there.
Before I knew it, I was singing the Mister Terrific theme song.
I'm sorry, Rose.
I didn't intend for this to happen.
Explain that to Mister Terrific.
He thinks you stole his job.
- I promise.
The minute I see him.
- He's right here.
We Where'd he go?
Mister Terrific's on the ledge like he's about to jump!
Hey!
Hey!
Where's everybody going?
We've got a show to do.
You're on.
I'm on in five, four, three, two.
Hi, kids!
Hi there, Mister Terrific.
How you doing?
Terrific.
- Uh, why don't you come inside.
- I can't fly from inside.
That's how Superman does it.
I have to fly from the ledge.
That's how we do it back on the planet Twylar.
- How's he doing?
- I'll be honest.
Right now, Squeaky Fromme has a better grasp on reality.
Hi, honey.
Hi, Rose.
I can see your house from here.
- Really?
Where?
- Rose!
Honey, we want you to come in off the ledge.
We're worried about you.
There's nothing to worry about.
I'm not going to jump.
That would be crazy.
- Oh, thank goodness.
- I'm going to fly.
- You can't fly.
- Mister Terrific can do anything.
Of course you can, Mister Terrific.
Rose, don't argue with him.
Mister Terrific, I think that Lex Luthor and The Joker are harassing an old lady in the stairwell.
Could you come in and melt them with your X-ray vision?
Mister Terrific doesn't have X-ray vision.
Please, Rose!
This is no time to point out his shortcomings!
Mister Terrific, come inside.
I don't want your job.
We'll get it back for you.
There's only one way, and that's to prove to my fans that I deserve the name Mister Terrific.
Hello, fans!
It's me, Mister Terrific!
Jump!
Jump!
- There's only one way to handle this.
- Rose!
Rose, no!
Rose!
Rose, don't go out Rose, come back here!
Don't worry, Dorothy.
I was trained in psychology back in St. Olaf.
That doesn't count, Rose.
In St. Olaf, they think that Freud is a way to cook chicken.
- Honey, do you still think you can fly?
- Yes.
Fine.
If you're gonna fly, you're gonna have to take me.
- Do you still wanna do it?
- Absolutely.
I should've paid closer attention during that refresher course back at the junior college.
Oh, my God!
He's flying.
Wait.
Wasn't it dangerous flying around that building?
Not at all.
I was rigged in a harness suspended by cables.
Yeah, but Rose wasn't.
Oh, I wasn't worried.
I know Mister Terrific's superhero code.
He'd never drop a girl.
I'm glad the publicity stunt worked, and I could not be happier that you got your job back.
Freddy'll be here.
We've got a lot to celebrate.
Yes.
I'm still Mister Terrific, and he's still Mr. Policeman.
I cannot sleep anymore.
I lie there waiting for the authorities to catch up with me.
Every siren I hear is for me.
Every footstep outside my window belongs to that obsessive detective who will not rest until he tracks me down!
Blanche, you are being ridiculous.
Oh, thank God!
I can't live with myself anymore.
Take me.
- Blanche!
- Dorothy, please.
I know what's best.
Just slap the handcuffs on me.
The bed's this way.
You know what's funny?
I was supposed to be Mr. Mailman today.
{END OF EPISODE 24}{START OF EPISODE 25}
Thank you for being a friend  Traveled down the road and back again  Your heart is true  You're a pal and a confidante  And if you threw a party  Invited everyone you knew  You would see The biggest gift would be from me  And the card attached would say  Thank you for being a friend  - Happy Mother's Day, Ma.
- Oh, you look beautiful.
Yeah, yeah.
Talk is cheap, and so is that buffet, so let's get movin' before all the shrimp is gone.
We can't.
Charlie Jr. Hasn't called to wish me happy Mother's Day.
Michael hasn't called me yet.
Janet hasn't called me yet, although she usually doesn't.
All my children called me except Phil.
I know he's thinking of me.
He's just short of cash.
Hello.
Person-to-person from the Duke of Windsor to Queen Elizabeth?
Oh, that's for me.
That's my Phil.
Hello.
The queen's not here.
She went shopping.
Thanks for calling, Phil, and send my love to the damn.
Every year they catch on quicker and quicker.
I love when Phil calls on Mother's Day.
It's the one time he doesn't ask for money.
One Mother's Day, I had to ask for money.
Stan's business wasn't doing well, and we had to ask his mother for a loan.
-  -  Go away!
Mama, it's me, Stanley.
- Oh, Stanley.
- Ma.
My pride and joy.
Sunshine of my life.
Hello, Mother Zbornak.
Yeah, right.
Here, Mama.
This is for you.
Happy Mother's Day.
Oh, thank you, Stanley.
Ah.
The Artwork of Adolf Hitler.
The minute we saw it, we knew it was for you.
Thank you so much, Stanley.
I'm going to put it on the coffee table.
It's from Dorothy, too.
If I had to thank her, I'd choke on the words.
Please risk it.
So, tell me, Stanley.
How are things at the novelty store?
Couldn't be better.
I was Salesman of the Month.
I'm sure you'll be proud to know that the name Zbornak has become synonymous with plastic vomit.
I I would absolutely love a cup of tea.
Oh, sure, Stanley.
Anything you want, sweetheart.
Start being nice, otherwise she's not gonna give us that money.
You ask.
She wouldn't refuse you.
Would break Mama's heart if she knew I was a failure.
To her, I have the business sense of a Rockefeller - and the charm of Cary Grant.
- I'm not surprised.
The woman drinks grain alcohol out of a measuring cup.
Here's the tea.
This is just hot water.
Enjoy.
I just remembered.
I have an important call to make.
You know the novelty business.
The pay phone's at the end of the trailer court.
What're you here for?
What do you want, money?
No.
Absolutely not.
How did you know?
I got the feeling my yutz son crapped out at his job.
Yutz.
I've never heard you say anything bad about Stan.
I don't have to.
The whole world makes fun of him.
Always has.
That's why I make him out to be more than he is.
- Then you will give him the money.
- No.
But I'll give it to you under one condition.
Don't ever tell Stanley it came from me.
- I don't understand.
- Stanley has a tendency to be weak.
If he knew I was a soft touch, he'd never amount to anything.
- How much do you need?
- $500.
I'll give you a thousand.
You know, Dorothy, I'm glad Stanley married you.
You love him, but you're tough on him.
Then why are you so mean?
If Stanley knew I liked you, he'd hang around here all the time.
He's a yutz.
Who needs him around here?
- Dorothy.
- Oh, thank God you came.
I thought she was gonna strangle me.
- I take it you weren't able - We'll figure something out.
I'll call you, Mama.
- Happy Mother's Day.
- Good-bye.
- Happy Mother's Day.
- Yeah, right.
As it turned out, Stan's mother wasn't so bad after all.
Please.
The woman wasn't human.
I think she ate mice.
Hello?
Charlie!
Hey, everyone, it's Charlie Jr. Oh!
Guess what.
He says it's cold in Minnesota.
Get outta here.
Is it cold enough that if you put your tongue on something metal, it'll stick?
Sure.
I'll hold.
This might be the ideal time to leave for that brunch.
The last Mother's Day I spent with my mama was back in Virginia.
Mama'd been ill for some time, and she was recovering in a convalescent home.
It was a lovely place.
Stay right there.
I want you to watch the proper way for a lady to make an entrance on the arm of a handsome gentleman.
You look just wonderful, Mama.
- Happy Mother's Day.
- Oh, is today Mother's Day?
Don't you remember?
I called you and told you I'd be here.
Of course.
Of course, Virginia.
No, darlin'.
Virginia couldn't come.
I'm Blanche.
Here.
Look.
I brought you a little present.
Lace handkerchiefs.
My.
You always used to say that there were two things a lady could never have enough of: Lace handkerchiefs and gentleman callers.
Maybe next Mother's Day' I'll bring you a gentleman caller.
You wanna go have some tea?
Not right now, darling.
Mama, do you remember that Mother's Day that I almost ruined when I ran off to get married?
No.
Sure you do.
I was a senior in high school, and I was madly in love with Deck Boevingloh.
We'd been dating for a month, so it seemed perfectly logical when he dropped by cheerleading practice and asked me to marry him.
Oh, I thought he was a wonderful catch at the time.
He was 40, out of work, twice divorced, had three kids.
But the real reason I wanted to marry him was because his oldest daughter was a rival of mine at cheerleading, and I figured if I married Deck, I'd be her mama and I could kick her off the squad.
Anyway, I remember the next day, I was in the Rexall when Deck came in lookin' more handsome than I've ever seen him.
Oh!
Black motorcycle boots, skintight Levis, a match in his mouth, and a white T-shirt with the sleeves rolled up to reveal his brand-new Woody the Woodpecker tattoo.
God, I was an idiot.
Anyway, he sauntered over to me at the soda fountain and gave me this long, smolderin' look and said, "So"?
Oh, I nearly fainted dead-away on the spot.
Next thing I knew, I was sittin' in that Studebaker racing out toward bayou country.
Deck knew this justice of the peace who specialized in marrying stupid teenage girls from well-to-do families.
Lucky for me, Old Man Montgomery had been in the Rexall that day and overheard us making plans and tipped off you and Daddy.
I don't know how you got there ahead of us.
But when we pulled up to Bubba's Chapel of Bliss and Tackle Shop, there you were.
Well, I was ready for the fight of my life, but all you said was, "Why, darlin', "I just came out here to give you away with my blessing.
"I think marrying Deck might be the best thing in the world for you, Blanche".
Well, at 17, I wasn't about to do anything you wanted me to do.
And you knew that.
I gave Deck back his I.D. Bracelet that had "Deck" on one side and "Allergic to the Law" on the other, hopped in the car with you and Daddy, and we took off home.
I asked you if you were mad at me.
You said, "Why, no, darlin'.
This is the best Mother's Day I've ever had".
Don't you remember that, Mama?
Well, I thought that happened to Virginia.
Wasn't Virginia the slut?
No, ma'am.
That was me.
Blanche, that didn't happen on Mother's Day.
That happened Christmas Day.
You're right.
Hey, that was Christmas D You remembered, Mama.
Blanche, there are days when I can't remember who I am, but trust me, I remember every stunt you ever pulled.
That's how I got half the gray hairs on this 85-year-old head.
Honey, you're 89.
Oh, darlin', didn't I ever teach you anything?
No true lady ever tells her age.
Happy Mother's Day, Mama.
- Bye, Charlie.
Thanks for calling.
- Now can we go eat?
No.
I haven't heard from Michael yet.
Fine.
Wait for your phone call.
My blood sugar'll drop.
I'll have a stroke.
This corsage'll live longer than I will.
You know how much it means to a mother to talk to her child on Mother's Day.
One Mother's Day, I spent with somebody else's mother.
On my way back to St. Olaf, I was stuck in this bus station.
Brrr!
You would think I'd almost forgotten what real cold feels like.
- I've gotten used to tropical weather.
- You here all the way from Nebraska?
- Miami.
- Miami.
That closer to Omaha or Lincoln?
Gee, it's great to be home.
They told me I could change buses here for St. Olaf.
- That's right.
- How much?
You want the express or the yokel?
- You mean local?
- I mean yokel.
A family of first cousins plays banjo music as the passengers get on and off.
- Do they take requests?
- No.
Give me the express.
- You got an hour to kill.
- Oh, thank you.
Excuse me.
Are you waiting for the bus to Northern Falls?
No.
St. Olaf.
I've visited there.
Lovely little town.
Oh, yes.
Yes, it is.
Rolling hills, charming homes.
- Yes.
- Full of idiots.
Yes.
What?
I never saw anything like it.
Must be the water.
I grew up in St. Olaf.
Most of my family still lives there.
Oh, no offense, dearie.
I didn't say that everyone there was an idiot.
It just seemed, though, that per capita, they had more than their share.
Oh, well, per capita, you're probably right.
- Do you live in Northern Falls?
- No.
I'm paying my daughter a visit.
For Mother's Day?
Me, too.
Oh, not just my daughter.
All of my children.
They paid for my trip.
They figured it'd be cheaper for me to come here than for all of them to fly there.
They figured that out?
- And they live in St. Olafs?
- Yes.
Oh, you must be very proud of them.
Oh.
I am.
- So, when was it you visited St. Olaf?
- Oh, Lord, it must be 50 years ago now.
I went to a wedding.
A distant cousin of mine married a local St. Olaf girl.
- What was the girl's name?
- Sonja Yongen - Yongenfrauliksteinerbrau?
- You know her?
Know her?
I was flower girl at the wedding.
There were no flowers that year because of what happened to Old Man Smith.
He was our town florist.
He was also our town's only blacksmith.
Come to think of it, he was our town's only black man.
When he first moved in, the town council decided to give him a traditional Scandinavian welcome gathering on his front lawn and singing songs and dressing up in bedsheets.
'Course, coming from Chattanooga, he wasn't familiar with the custom.
He had a heart attack.
He spent most of the summer in intensive care.
After that, when somebody moved in, the town council just handed out peanut brittle and free passes to the local movie house, which they hoped to build someday.
- Are you all right?
You seem upset.
-  I was just thinking I'm sorry I recently got a hearing aid.
Don't worry.
It hardly shows at all.
At Sonja's wedding, of course without flowers they didn't know what to do and discovered she was on the hayride with Little Lars, not Big Lars.
She yelled, "Whoa"!
And jumped right off the wagon.
Either that story is actually funny, or the batteries are going in and out in my hearing aid.
Rose, I want you to know that I think it's very sweet that you're keeping an old lady company like this.
Don't be silly.
I'm enjoying every minute.
Every hour.
I can't believe the buses are so late.
I should call the kids again.
Are you sure you shouldn't call your daughter?
Mother's Day isn't until tomorrow.
She knows I'll be there.
I always am.
- Still, she must be worried by now.
- Rose.
My daughter's dead.
She passed away some time ago.
I go to the cemetery on Mother's Day.
It was always a special day for the two of us.
I like to pretend it still is.
Problem is, this year I don't think I'm going to make it.
- Aren't you feeling well?
- I ran away from the home, and they're about to catch with me.
Are you Anna Eggerman?
Anna, they're worried about you back at the home.
You're gonna have to come with me.
Attention!
Express to Cedar Grove, River Junction, Northern Falls, now boarding!
For cryin' out loud, Jacob.
There's three people here.
You could've just pointed to the door.
Sheriff, there's been a mistake.
- This woman's my mother.
- I have a telex that says I don't care what it says.
She's my mother, and we're on our way home.
If you'll excuse us, we have a bus to catch.
Come on, Mama.
- Thank you, Rose.
- Happy Mother's Day.
It's a really sweet story, Rose.
So sell it to the Reader's Digest.
Let's get outta here.
-  - Must be Michael.
Hello.
Hello, Michael!
Okay.
That's it.
When she gets off the phone, we're going.
I'm tired of listening to lousy Mother's Day stories.
Sophia, don't you have a story?
I said I was tired of lousy stories.
I wouldn't mind a good one.
Picture it: Brooklyn, 1957, the second Sunday in May.
I was getting the house ready which mostly meant trying to get my Salvadore into a shirt with sleeves.
-  - Turn that thing off and get up.
Mama will be here and you look like a bum.
So, what's the problem?
She already thinks I'm a bum.
- Salvadore.
- What?
Did you get me a present for Mother's Day?
- Why?
You're not my mother.
- I'm the mother of your children.
A thousand nights of begging.
Three times, you said yes.
For that, you want a present?
It's not enough they declare it a national holiday?
-  - That's Mama.
She sees you like this, we'll never convince her to move in.
- Move!
Move!
- Oh, boy.
It's a dark day in Brooklyn today.
Dodgers are moving out, your mother's moving in!
Grandma, here we are.
I'm in a wheelchair.
I'm not blind.
I can see where we are.
And it could stand a good vacuum.
Hi, Dorothy.
Hello, Mama.
Where's Salvadore?
He's hiding from me.
He always hides from me.
The little monkey hates me.
Don't be silly.
Pop is crazy about you.
Don't lie to your grandmother!
It's a sin!
He's not crazy about you, but he's very fond of you.
He hates me.
The man repairs complicated machinery for a living.
Three times this month, he couldn't set the brake on my wheelchair.
That was a coincidence.
All three times was at the top of the stairs to the Flatbush subway station.
Mama, if Salvadore hates you, - why does he want you to live with us?
- What?
Salvadore and I would like you to move in.
- I am not moving in.
- Why not?
Let me tell you a story.
Picture it: Sicily, 1881.
A beautiful, young peasant girl - Mama, not another story.
- Sophia, come closer.
Grandma!
You're movin' in.
We think it's best for you.
- You didn't discuss it with me.
- Fine.
Let's discuss it.
There's nothing to discuss!
I'm not moving in.
Dorothy, if I ever do this to you, I want you to shoot me.
Could you put that in writing?
Dorothy, come closer.
Okay, I can solve this problem.
Take me to the top of the stairs again?
I don't want you here, huh?
This is my home.
A man's home is his castle.
- In this castle, I'm the king.
Capisce?
- He's talking nonsense.
- What are you saying?
- I want you to move in.
- You mean that?
- No.
Ah!
Too bad.
You said it.
Happy Mother's Day, Mama.
Please!
Happy Mother's Day, Ma.
Okay, honey, just a second.
Ma, he wants to talk to you.
Hello, Michael.
Have you eaten?
Well, I haven't.
Good-bye.
Let's roll.
Sophia, we can't.
We haven't all gotten our calls.
- Oh, forget it.
She's not gonna call.
- Well, she might.
Hello.
Janet, it's so good to hear your voice, honey.
Ma, what are you doing?
Cooking.
If I wait for you to take me, I'll starve to death.
- You're making me feel guilty.
- I know.
It's Mother's Day.
