MY POOR GRANDPARENTS COME OUT ALL THE WAY FROM GREECE TO CELEBRATE THEIR AND THEY'RE PROBABLY WANDERING AROUND THE AIRPORT LOST, SCARED, CONFUSED.

I'D BETTER CHECK ON THE BAKLAVA.
HONEY?
YES, DEAR?
I MEAN, DO YOU WANT HONEY ON YOUR BAKLAVA?
OF COURSE I DO.
WHAT'S BAKLAVA WITHOUT HONEY?
RIGHT, HONEY?
JESS, HONEY THIS WOMAN DIDN'T FLY 12,000 MILES JUST TO STUFF YOUR FACE FULL OF MOUSSAKA.
NOW, WHAT'S GOING ON BETWEEN YOU TWO?
COME ON, BECKY.
NOTHING.
YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT YOU.
NOTHING COULD COME BETWEEN US.
BAKLAVA.
CAREFUL.
IT'S VERY HOT STUFF.

THANKS, YAYA.
I'LL TEACH YOU AN AMERICAN DANCE.

HAS ANYBODY SEEN D.J.?
SHE'S AT THE MALL WITH SYLVIO.
SHE'S ALONE WITH SYLVIO?
NOT TO WORRY.
SYLVIO IS FINE BOY, SO MUCH LIKE JESSE WHEN HE WAS YOUNG.
OH, THAT'S VERY COMFORTING.
COMET, THIS IS D.J.'s SOCK.
PICK UP THE SCENT, COMET.
FIND D.J., FIND D.J. DAD, THAT'S COMET, NOT LASSIE.
HOW'D YOU LIKE YOUR FIRST SLURPEE?
WELL, I'VE NEVER SLURPED WITH A GIRL BEFORE.
HOW DID I DO?
GREAT.
YOU SLURPED AT THE RIGHT SPEED.
I WAS VERY NERVOUS.
THE STARS ARE SO PRETTY.
THE PRETTIEST STARS ARE IN YOUR EYES.
SURE, COMET, WE CAN GO FOR A WALK.
COME ON, BOY.
COME HERE, COMET.
THAT'S A GOOD-- OH, LOOK, IT'S D.J. WELL, WHAT DO YOU KNOW?
DAD, WERE YOU SPYING ON ME?
TRUST ME, IF I WAS SPYING, I WOULD'VE BEEN OUT HERE WAY BEFORE ALL THAT STAR TALK.
MR.
TANNER YOUR DAUGHTER IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IN THE WORLD.
SHE'S OK.
YOU MUST BE INCREDIBLY TIRED AFTER YOUR LONG FLIGHT.
WHY DON'T YOU COME ON INSIDE AND I'LL SHOW YOU TO YOUR CAGE-- UH, ROOM.
DANNY, HAVE YOU SEEN MY DRESS SHIRT?
DO I LOOK LIKE YOUR MOTHER?
IT'S IN THE HAMPER.
HERE IT IS.
I DID ALL OF YOUR LAUNDRY THIS MORNING.
I JUST HAVE TO IRON IT.
OH, WELL, LET ME DO THAT FOR JESSE.
I MEAN, AFTER ALL, YOU'RE HERE ON VACATION.
BECKY, YOU KNOW I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY SEEN YOU IRON.
ME?
OH, I LIVE TO IRON.
I JUST HAVE TO GET ONE OF THOSE IRONING TABLES.
SWEETHEART, THAT'S IRONING BOARD.
SHUT UP.
DANNY, I TOOK THE GIRLS SHOPPING.
WAIT TILL YOU SEE THIS.
OKAY, COME ON IN, GIRLS.
GO AHEAD.
TRY AND TELL THEM APART.
YOU'LL NEVER GUESS, DADDY.
WOW, THIS IS A TOUGH ONE.
BUT I BET THE REAL MICHELLE IS THE ONE WHO JUST CALLED ME DADDY.
AW, NUTS.
AW, HOO.
BLESS YOU.
AND I THINK THAT WOULD MAKE YOU MELINA.
YOU GOT IT, DUD.
I TOLD YOU, IT'S "YOU GOT IT, DUDE".
DUDE MR.
TANNER I'D LIKE TO TAKE A WALK WITH YOUR DAUGHTER.
HEY, NO PROBLEM.
MICHELLE, TAKE A WALK WITH SYLVIO.
I MEAN D.J. I WANT TO WALK WITH HER AROUND THE KITCHEN TABLE.
YOU WANT TO WALK AROUND THE KITCHEN TABLE?
HEY, KNOCK YOURSELF OUT.
TAKE A SPIN AROUND THE COUNTER IF YOU WANT.
THANKS, DAD.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
I'LL BE OVER HERE IF YOU NEED ME.
THIS IS REALLY SWEET.
AND TOTALLY WEIRD.
DO YOU REMEMBER THIS?
DIDN'T YOU AND I WALK AROUND YOUR TABLE IN POMPADORAS?
YES!
I WAS WAITING TO SEE IF YOU REMEMBERED!
THAT'S WHY I CAME TO SEE YOU!
THAT'S IT.
GET YOUR POMPADORIAN PAWS OFF MY BOYFRIEND.
BUT WE DID THE TRADITIONAL WEDDING WALK.
JESSE IS MY HUSBAND.
AND NOW D.J. IS MY WIFE.
WHOA, BABY!
WHOA, BABY!
MY D.J. IS MARRIED!
I COULD HAVE GREAT-GREAT-GRANDCHILDREN.
I CAN HAVE MY OWN ROOM!
WAIT A MINUTE.
D.J. AND SYLVIO ARE NOT MARRIED.
NEITHER ARE THEY.
ACCORDING TO POMPADORAS TRADITION, THEY ARE MARRIED.
YOU GIVE THE GIRL FLOWERS, YOU WALK AROUND THE TABLE, AND THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT.
THAT'S NOT A WEDDING, THAT'S THE HOKEY-POKEY.
JESSE, SAY SOMETHING.
IT'S A VERY DELICATE SITUATION HERE WITH MY FAMILY.
ALL RIGHT, LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.
IS THIS THE KIND OF WOMAN YOU WANT-- SOMEONE WHO LIVES ONLY TO COOK FOR YOU, AND CLEAN FOR YOU, AND WAIT ON YOU HAND IN FOOT?
GOD, YOU MAKE IT SOUND SO NEGATIVE.
FINE.
SHE'S ALL YOURS.
I'LL SEND YOU A CARD ON YOUR ANNIVERSARY.
THIS AUGUST WILL BE OUR 13th.
CONGRATULATIONS!
BECKY YOU'RE IN BIG TROUBLE, MISTER.
WHEN SHOULD I TELL YOUR WIFE YOU'LL BE BACK?
LET'S MEET OUR FIRST NEWLYWED COUPLE.
SHE'S IN THE EIGHTH GRADE, HE'S IN THE OLIVE BUSINESS.
THEY'VE ONLY BEEN MARRIED TWO AND A HALF MINUTES.
PLEASE WELCOME SYLVIO AND D.J. BANALAKIS!
WHY DON'T I TAKE THE LOVELY COUPLE INTO THE LIVING ROOM AND TELL THEM WHAT THEY'VE WON, BOB?
A DINING SET ESPECIALLY SELECTED JUST FOR YOU.
I LOVE WEDDINGS.
D.J., WHY DON'T YOU GO ON UP TO YOUR ROOM AND WAIT FOR DADDY?
DADDY, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, YOU CAN'T SEND ME TO MY ROOM ANYMORE.
I'M A MARRIED WOMAN.
YOU'RE NOT A MARRIED WOMAN.
PAPA-- PLEASE DON'T CALL ME THAT.
I'M READY TO LEARN THE FAMILY BUSINESS.
WHAT DO YOU DO FOR JOB?
I HAVE A TALK SHOW.
WELL, I WILL STUDY HARD, AND WHEN YOU DIE, I WILL TAKE OVER.
I WILL NEVER DIE.
SYLVIO, WALK WITH ME, TALK WITH ME.
WE HAVE TO GET OVER TO IORGOS' AND GINA'S ANNIVERSARY PARTY, BUT FIRST LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT THIS THING WE HAVE IN AMERICA CALLED A RESTRAINING ORDER.
HEY!
OH, THIS IS A PRETTY PICTURE.
I THOUGHT I SHOULD COME DOWN HERE AND GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO EXPLAIN, BUT YOU'RE TOO BUSY HUGGING YOUR WIFE.
HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME?
BECKY, LIS-- NOW IT'S A GREEK PARTY!
BECKY-- WHAT?
THIS WHOLE THING HAS GOTTEN OUT OF HAND HERE.
NOW, THERE'S SOMETHING YOU BOTH SHOULD HEAR.
ELENA, LISTEN, YOU'RE A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN WITH PASSION AND FIRE-- OH, I'M GLAD I STUCK AROUND FOR THIS.
WAIT A MINUTE, YOU'LL LIKE THIS PART.
THERE'S NO FUTURE FOR US 'CAUSE I'M MADLY IN LOVE WITH BECKY.
BECKY, I'M MADLY IN LOVE WITH YOU.
OH, JESSE I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY I GOT SO JEALOUS.
JUST THE THOUGHT OF LOSING YOU MADE ME CRAZY.
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA LOSE ME.
I'M SORRY, ELENA.
MAYBE I WAS CRAZY TO HAVE COME HERE, BUT I ALWAYS WONDERED WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF WE EVER SAW EACH OTHER AGAIN.
NOW I KNOW WE CAN ONLY BE FRIENDS.
IT'S TOO BAD WE'RE STILL MARRIED.
WELL WHAT DO YOU KNOW, WE LOST THE GROUP.
IORGOS, AS LONG AS WE'RE HERE, LET'S TALK DIVORCE.
DIVORCE?
WHO WANTS A DIVORCE?
THEY DO.
THEY DO.
WELL, YOU ARE IN LUCK.
SINCE NO FARM ANIMALS ACTUALLY CHANGED HANDS, A DIVORCE IS POSSIBLE.
DAD?
SYLVIO, I'M SORRY, BUT I'LL NEVER FORGET YOU.
AFTER ALL, YOU WERE MY FIRST HUSBAND.
FOR ONE HOUR, I WAS MARRIED TO THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IN THE WORLD.
AW, DAD, DO I HAVE TO?
OH, YEAH.
EVERYBODY WHO WANTS A DIVORCE, FOLLOW ME.
NOW JOIN HANDS AND WALK AROUND THE TABLE BACKWARDS.
BIZARRE POMPADORIAN TABLE CEREMONIES ON THE NEXT GERALDO.
OK, I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU MEN AND EX-WIVES.
WE CAME 12,000 MILES TO GET DIVORCES.
WE SHOULD HAVE GONE TO DISNEYLAND.
ATTENTION, EVERYBODY.
YOU KNOW, ALL THIS TALKING ABOUT DIVORCE MAKES ME REALIZE HOW LUCKY I AM TO HAVE MY GINA FOR 50 YEARS.
AND TO THINK SHE DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO MARRY ME.
YOU HAD A BEARD.
IT WAS LIKE KISSING A GOAT.
NO, I KISSED A GOAT ONCE.
IT WAS VERY DIFFERENT.
ANYWAY, I SHAVED, AND I GOT WITH MY GINA.
I LOVE YOU, GINA.
I LOVE YOU.
THAT'S SO BEAUTIFUL.
THAT COULD BE YOU AND I IN 50 YEARS.
I HOPE IT WILL BE.
IF YOU'RE LUCKY ENOUGH TO FIND THE RIGHT PERSON THAT YOU REALLY LOVE AND WANNA SPEND YOUR WHOLE LIFE WITH, MY FEELING IS, WHY WAIT?
OK.
SO WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?
REALLY?
REALLY.
ALL RIGHT.
THIS TIME WE'RE GONNA DO THIS RIGHT.
YOU KNOW, LAST TIME WE DID THIS, YOU LEFT ME AT THE ALTAR.
WE WERE IN NEVADA.
YOU SAID, "LET'S GET MARRIED THIS SECOND".
THIS TIME WE CAN TAKE OUR TIME AND PLAN A REAL WEDDING.
BECKY-- HOLD IT.
WHAT?
DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER WIVES IN ANY OTHER COUNTRIES?
NO, NO.
OK.
YOU WERE SAYING?
WILL YOU WALK AROUND THE TABLE WITH ME?
YES.
YES!
WOO!
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I HAVE AN ANNOUNCEMENT TO MAKE.
REBECCA DONALDSON AND JESSE KATSOPOLIS ARE NOW ENGAGED TO BE MARRIED!
AGAIN?
YES, AGAIN.
YEAH!
OOH!
OH, DID YOU HEAR THAT, GIRLS?
UNCLE JESSE AND REBECCA ARE GONNA BE MARRIED.
LET'S CELEBRATE.
YOU GOT IT, DUDE.

I REDID THE WHOLE ROOM IN RETRO-HIP.
YOU GOT YOUR RAT PACK OVER HERE, YOUR ELVIS MOTIF THERE, A BRAND NEW HAIR ACCOUTERMENTS CENTER HERE.
I HOPE YOU'RE NOT TOO DISAPPOINTED BUT I HAD TO TAKE DOWN YOUR PINK BUNNY WALLPAPER.
IT'S ABOUT TIME.
STEPH, I'VE BEEN LIVING WITH THOSE STUPID PINK BUNNIES FOR 3 YEARS.
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SOMETHING SOONER?
YOU DIDN'T ASK.
I DIDN'T ASK.
OF COURSE.
HEY, WHERE ARE THE BUNNIES?
THE BUNNIES WENT BYE-BYE.
BUT I LOVED THE BUNNIES.
WELL, IT'S A GOOD THING I HAPPENED TO SAVE ONE VERY SPECIAL IMPORTANT BUNNY FOR YOU, AND I FRAMED HIM, AND HERE HE IS.
NOW THIS ROOM IS COOL.
COOL!
COOL, BABY!

YOU KNOW, GIRLS, EVERY YEAR, WE WATCH THE MUSIC VIDEO AWARDS AND STUFF OUR FACES WITH JUNK FOOD.
THIS YEAR, LET'S MAKE IT INTERESTING.
EVERY TIME YOU MAKE SOMETHING INTERESTING, WE GET IN TROUBLE.
I'LL BET YOU FIVE MARSHMALLOWS AT LEAST ONE GUY FROM GUNS 'N ROSES FALLS OFF THE STAGE.
FOUR COOKIES SAY THEY DON'T EVEN FIND THE STAGE.
LET'S PLAY PILLOW FIGHT.
GOOD ONE, MICHELLE.
YEAH, THAT WAS REAL FUNNY, DEEJ.
PILLOW FIGHT!
ALL RIGHT, TANNERS!
OHH!
YOU'RE HISTORY, GIBBLER!
UHH!
YOU GUYS ARE HISTORY!
NO!
YOU'RE IN BIG TROUBLE, MISTERS!
IS EVERYBODY OK?
YEAH, WE'RE FINE.
EVERYTHING'S GREAT.
THANKS FOR STOPPING BY.
I THOUGHT I COVERED EVERYTHING, BUT APPARENTLY I FORGOT TO MENTION NEVER OPEN A WINDOW WITH A COAT RACK.
OK, SOMEBODY START EXPLAINING.
THEY DID IT.
YOU LITTLE SQUEALER.
YOU STARTED THE PILLOW FIGHT.
MICHELLE, DID YOU START A PILLOW FIGHT?
YES, I DID.
MICHELLE, THAT WAS WRONG.
YOU GIRLS ARE IN BIG TROUBLE.
WHY ARE WE IN TROUBLE?
BECAUSE SHE'S JUST A LITTLE GIRL.
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SET AN EXAMPLE.
WE DID.
WE SET AN EXAMPLE OF HOW DESTRUCTIVE PILLOW FIGHTS CAN BE.
NICE TRY.
NOW, ACCORDING TO THE OFFICIAL DAD'S HANDBOOK, THE PUNISHMENT FOR FURNITURE THROUGH A WINDOW IS RAKING THE YARD TO PAY FOR IT AND NO MUSIC VIDEO AWARDS.
BOY, MR.
T, YOU SUCKED ALL THE FUN OUT OF THIS ROOM.
KIMMY, I KNOW I SHOULD PUNISH YOU AND NOT YOUR PARENTS, BUT I'M SENDING YOU HOME.
BE RIGHT WITH YOU, BOYS.
JOEY DON'T YOU THINK IT'S A LITTLE STRANGE TO BUY REBECCA'S ENGAGEMENT RING FROM A GUY WHO'S SELLING JEWELRY OUT OF A TACKLE BOX?
STU HAS THE BEST PRICES IN TOWN.
BESIDES, HE GAVE ME A GREAT DEAL ON THIS ROLEX.
JOEY, THAT SAYS "ROLOX".
SO, KIDS, GIVE ME A PRICE RANGE.
YOU DEEPLY IN LOVE, MODERATELY IN LOVE, OR DESPERATE FOR COMPANIONSHIP?
LISTEN, STU, I WANNA GET BECKY A RING THAT IS SO BEAUTIFUL, SO SPECTACULAR, THAT SHE'LL HAVE NO IDEA THAT I'M ON A BUDGET.
BUDGET.
WELL, LET'S SEE WHAT WE HAVE IN OUR ZIP-LOCK DEPARTMENT HERE.
NOW, THIS IS GOING TO BE WHAT YOU CALL YOUR STARTER RING-- VERY POPULAR WITH THE HIGH SCHOOL CROWD.
STU, JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY, IS THAT A DIAMOND OR A REALLY SHINY PIECE OF LINT?
I HAD A RING JUST LIKE THIS WHEN I WAS A KID.
I GOTTA DO BETTER THAN THIS, STU.
NOW HERE'S SOMETHING FROM OUR "STU, I GOTTA DO BETTER THAN THIS" COLLECTION.
WHOA!
NOW THAT'S A HEADLIGHT.
OH, STU, THIS RING IS BEAUTIFUL.
HOW MUCH ARE WE TALKING HERE?
THAT'S GONNA RUN YOU, UH HAVE MERCY, I HOPE THAT'S YOUR TELEPHONE NUMBER.
HI, GUYS.
HEY, BECK.
OH, JESS.
THIS IS SO EXCITING.
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE ACTUALLY PICKING OUT AN ENGAGEMENT RING.
THIS IS SO ROMANTIC.
HOW COME WE'RE NOT IN A STORE?
BECAUSE, LITTLE LADY, ONLY STU COULD BRING A RING LIKE THIS RIGHT INTO YOUR HOME.
STU--  OH, SWEETHEART, IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
BECKY, YOU SURE THE DIAMOND IS THE RIGHT SIZE FOR YOU?
OH, IT'S PERFECT.
I WOULDN'T WANT ANYTHING BIGGER THAN THIS.
ALL RIGHT, IF THIS IS THE RING YOU WANT THIS IS THE RING YOU'RE GONNA GET.
REBECCA DONALDSON, THIS IS A SYMBOL OF MY UNDYING DEVOTION TO YOU.
OH, WE'RE GONNA HAVE SUCH A WONDERFUL LIFE TOGETHER.
OH, THANK YOU!
THANK YOU!
I HAVE TO CALL MY MOTHER.
I LOVE YOU.
WHAT A ROCK!
DID YOU SEE THAT, JOEY?
DID YOU SEE HER FACE?
I'VE NEVER SEEN HER HAPPIER.
JESS.
WHOA!
"THEN MR.
KNOX SAID, "FOXING SUCKS.
OUR GAME IS DONE, SIR.
THANK YOU FOR A LOT OF FUN, SIR".
NOW IT'S TIME FOR THE MOST FUN OF ALL-- BEDTIME.
READ IT AGAIN, PLEASE.
DADDY SAID IT'S TIME FOR BED.
DON'T SHAKE YOUR HEAD.
YOUR STORY'S READ.
IT'S TIME FOR BED.
TO BED, I SAID.
YOU OUGHT TO LAY OFF THAT SEUSS, MAN.
SING ME THE TEDDY BEAR SONG.
MICHELLE, IT'S BEDTIME.
NO.
IT'S TEDDY BEAR TIME.
COME ON, GUYS.
ONE TUNE.
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
OKAY.
ONE TUNE.
THIS ONE'S GOING OUT TO A LITTLE LADY WHO'S ABOUT TO GO TO SLEEP.

OK, MICHELLE, YOU HAD YOUR LITTLE SONG.
NOW IT'S TIME TO GO TO SLEEP.
GOOD NIGHT KISS.
GOOD NIGHT, MICHELLE.
GOOD NIGHT, HONEY.
SWEET DREAMS.
THIS IS NUTS.
I'M OUT OF HERE.
I HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF SOME BUSINESS.
HE'S GONNA SELL HIS ELVIS GUITAR TO PAY FOR BECKY'S RING.
HE IS?
JESS, HOW CAN YOU SELL YOUR ELVIS GUITAR?
IT'S YOUR BABY.
IT'S REALLY NOT THAT SPECIAL.
IT'S JUST A PERSONALLY AUTOGRAPHED, ONE OF A KIND NATIONAL TREASURE THAT THE KING USED TO SERENADE A BUNCH OF HILLBILLIES OFF THE BACK OF A CHICKEN TRUCK IN KISSIN' COUSINS.
I'M BACK.
WELL, YOU BETTER GET BACK IN BED.
NO WAY, JOSE.
GUYS, I THINK SOMETHING'S REALLY BOTHERING MICHELLE.
SHE'S NEVER CALLED ME JOSE BEFORE.
IS SOMETHING BOTHERING YOU, PRINCESS?
I WANNA PLAY.
DEEPLY TROUBLED CHILD.
EXCUSE US ONE SECOND, YOUR MAJESTY.
WHY DON'T YOU GO WAIT IN YOUR LITTLE ROOM.
WE'LL COME SEE YOU IN A MOMENT.
THANK YOU.
WANNA KNOW MICHELLE'S PROBLEM?
WE TREAT HER LIKE THE QUEEN OF 3-YEAR-OLDS.
WELL SHE IS.
SHE'S ADORABLE.
AND DON'T TELL ME YOU DON'T MELT WHEN SHE STICKS THOSE TWO LITTLE THUMBS UP AND SAYS, "YOU GOT IT, DUDE".
I'M TELLING YOU GUYS, SHE'S JUST TESTING US, OKAY?
I WAS READING IN MODERN MOM MAGAZINE-- YOU READ MODERN MOM MAGAZINE?
WELL I WAS IN THE BEAUTY PARLOR WITH BECKY AND I NEEDED SOMETHING TO READ AND THIS OTHER LADY ALREADYGOT THE NEW COSMO.
SO WHAT DO YOU CARE?
THE POINT IS THAT IT SAID THAT KIDS MICHELLE'S AGE ARE GONNA TEST THEIR LIMITS.
AND THAT'S WHEN YOU GOTTA GET TOUGH, SET THE RULES AND STICK TO THEM.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE RIGHT.
WE GOTTA LAY DOWN THE LAW AND SHOW HER WHO'S BOSS.
GOOD, THE VIDEO AWARDS ARE STARTING.
NOW KIMMY, MOVE THE TV A LITTLE TO THE LEFT.
KEEP GOING.
THERE.
THAT'S PERFECT.
WHO WANTS TO PLAY?
WE CAN'T PLAY.
WE'RE GROUNDED, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
YOU'RE WELCOME VERY MUCH.
MICHELLE, THERE YOU ARE.
D.J., WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?
OH, JUST THE STARS.
REALLY?
OH, I SEE STARS, ALL RIGHT-- M.C. HAMMER, BILLY IDOL OH, HI, MR.
GIBBLER!
I THINK HE'S YELLING SOMETHING AT ME.
HE SAID GET A NEW HOBBY OR HE'S CALLING THE POLICE.
THAT'S IT.
I WANT BOTH YOU GIRLS IN BED RIGHT NOW.
WHAT?
MICHELLE'S NOT EVEN IN BED YET.
DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT MICHELLE.
JUST GET A GOOD NIGHT SLEEP.
YOU GOT A FULL DAY OF RAKING LEAVES AHEAD OF YOU.
ALL RIGHT, COME ON, LITTLE PRINCESS.
WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE?
ALL OF A SUDDEN, MICHELLE IS CINDERELLA AND WE'RE THE UGLY STEPSISTERS?
WHO ARE YOU CALLING UGLY?
UH, DANNY.
SHOW HER WHO'S BOSS.
OK.
SWEETHEART IT'S TIME TO GO TO SLEEP.
OH, SHE'S SHAKING NOW.
OBSERVE.
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN, KID, CLOSE YOUR EYES.
COUNT SOME SHEEP.
BA-DA-BING, WE'LL SEE YOU IN THE MORNING.
OK, GOOD NIGHT KISS.
GOOD NIGHT, MICHELLE.
GOOD NIGHT, SWEETHEART.
SWEET DREAMS.
SEE THAT?
ONCE YOU PUT YOUR FOOT DOWN, THE REST IS A PIECE OF CAKE.
CAN I COME OUT, PLEASE?
NO.
GO BACK TO BED.
PLEASE LET ME OUT.
OH, PLEASE, LET HER OUT.
I WANT A DRINK OF WATER.
YOU JUST HAD ONE.
I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM.
YOU WENT ALREADY.
PLEASE LET ME OUT.
OH, LOOK AT THOSE LITTLE FINGERS.
OH, IS MY LITTLE PRINCESS REACHING OUT FOR HUMAN CONTACT?
COME ON, GUYS.
HANG TOUGH.
HOLD ON HERE.
DON'T YOU LOVE ME ANYMORE?
WHAT, ARE YOU GUYS MADE OF STONE OR SOMETHING?
CAREFUL, MICHELLE.
WE'RE COMING IN.
LET'S PARTY, DUDES!
YEAH, I GUESS WE SHOWED HER WHO'S BOSS.
YES, I'M READY.
HOO HOO HOO HOO!
HEY!
WHAT'S UP?
HOO HOO HOO HOO HOO!
MICHELLE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WATCHING ARSENIO.
LET'S GET BUSY!
AHH.
YOUNG LADY, I TOLD YOU TO GET INTO BED.
WANT SOME CHICKEN?
THANKS.
MICHELLE, I THINK IT'S TIME TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF SLEEP.
YOU SEE, THE AMOUNT OF SLEEP A PERSON NEEDS IS INVERSELY PROPORTIONATE TO THEIR AGE.
FOR EXAMPLE, A PERSON YOUR AGE PROBABLY NEEDS ONLY WHEREAS A PERSON MY AGE MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET BY ON, OH, SIX OR SEVEN.
OF COURSE, AS WITH ALL RULES, THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS.
A BEAR, HE CAN SLEEP ALL WINTER.
WHEREAS AN OWL IS UP ALL NIGHT.
MICHELLE?
MICHELLE.
WE'LL GO OVER ALL OF THIS AGAIN TOMORROW.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
LEAVING YOUR TRAIL SO YOU CAN FIND YOUR WAY BACK?
LEAVES!
MICHELLE!
CUT IT OUT!
THAT'S IT!
YOU WRECK THEM, YOU RAKE THEM.
GIRLS, I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE MAKING MICHELLE DO YOUR PUNISHMENT.
BUT, DAD, SHE RAN-- STEPH, SAVE YOUR ENERGY.
YOU'LL NEED IT TO RAKE.
DADDY, I WANNA GO SWIMMING.
NO, MICHELLE.
IT'S TOO COLD OUTSIDE.
NO SWIMMING, BUT IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY FOR RAKING LEAVES.
LET'S GET THIS OVER WITH.
MICHELLE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
GOING SWIMMING.
BUT DAD SAID NO.
WELL, I SAID YES.
BUT IT'S TOO COLD OUTSIDE.
THAT'S WHY I'M SWIMMING INSIDE.
JOEY, WHY DID WE EVER AGREE TO DO A COMMERCIAL FOR THE NATIONAL LIVER COUNCIL?
YOU GUYS, CAN I INTERRUPT?
PLEASE.
JESS, HONEY, I HAD MY RING APPRAISED FOR INSURANCE.
I HAD NO IDEA YOU SPENT SO MUCH MONEY ON IT.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, SWEETHEART.
WELL, I AM WORRIED, BECAUSE I KNOW THAT YOU SOLD YOUR ELVIS GUITAR TO HELP PAY FOR IT.
WHO TOLD YOU I-- JOSEPH?
WELL, NOW, IT'S NOT JOEY'S FAULT.
I MADE HIM TELL ME.
WHAT'D SHE DO?
TWIST YOUR ARM?
NO.
SHE BENT MY THUMB BACK LIKE THIS, AND IT REALLY HURT.
GET OUT, LIVER BOY.
OK, LIVERACE.
LOOK, BECKY.
THE RING IS PAID FOR.
CASE CLOSED.
ALL RIGHT, FINE.
BUT IT JUST SO HAPPENS I BOUGHT YOU A PRESENT TOO.
REMEMBER YOUR FAVORITE GUITAR?
THANK YOU.
THIS IS VERY SWEET, BUT I CAN'T ACCEPT THE GUITAR.
I MEAN, IT WOULD BE LIKE YOU CHIPPING IN FOR YOUR OWN RING.
SO WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?
EVERYTHING.
IT'S A TRADITION WE'RE TALKING HERE.
MAN BUYS WOMAN RING, WOMAN WEARS RING, MAN AND WOMAN LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER.
NOWHERE IN THE STORY DOES IT SAY, "WOMAN BUYS GUITAR".
HOW AM I POSSIBLY SUPPOSED TO RESPOND TO THAT KIND OF TWISTED NEANDERTHAL LOGIC?
VERY SIMPLE.
BY SAYING, "JESSE, YOU'RE RIGHT, "YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN RIGHT, AND YOU'LL ALWAYS BE RIGHT".
OH, I'LL STITCH A SAMPLER OF THAT AND HANG IT OVER THE MANTEL.
LOOK, JESS.
IF YOU DON'T ACCEPT THE GUITAR, THE I'M AFRAID I CAN'T ACCEPT THE RING.
BECKY.
NOW, JESSE, LOOK.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE THIS TOUGH, MACHO GUY WITH ME.
WE'RE A TEAM NOW, AND I WOULD LIKE IT IF OUR MARRIAGE WAS AN EQUAL PARTNERSHIP.
SO LET ME BE AS GENEROUS TO YOU AS YOU ARE TO ME.
BECK, LISTEN, IT ALL MAKES SENSE TO ME, BUT I JUST CAN'T TAKE THE GUITAR BACK.
IT JUST DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT.
OKAY.
HOW DOES THIS FEEL?
OW OW OW OW!
TAKE IT BACK!
ALL RIGHT, I'LL TAKE IT BACK.
SEE, JESS?
YOU WERE RIGHT.
YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN RIGHT.
YOU ALWAYS WILL BE RIGHT.
RIGHT.
TOOT TOOT.
TOOT TOOT.
HAVING FUN, MICHELLE?
SURF'S UP, DUDES.
SURF'S UP, DUDES?
NO.
YOUR TIME'S UP, DUDETTE.
I'M CALLING DAD.
WAIT.
IS THERE ANY POSSIBLE WAY WE CAN GET BLAMED FOR THIS?
NOT THIS TIME.
LOOK AT HER.
SHE'S A SITTING DUCK.
WE GOT HER NOW.
DAD, GET IN HERE!
HURRY UP!
GIRLS, WHAT'S ALL THE-- NO SHOES IN THE POOL.
GIRLS, YOU BETTER HAVE AN EXPLANATION FOR THIS.
HE'S BLAMING US!
THIS IS A NIGHTMARE!
DAD, IT'S NOT OUR FAULT.
MICHELLE DRAGGED IN HER POOL, MICHELLE FILLED IT WITH WATER, MICHELLE BLEW UP HER FLOATIES, AND MICHELLE THREW HERSELF A POOL PARTY.
DAD, THE KEY WORD HERE IS MICHELLE.
WELL IF YOU SAW HER DO ALL THOSE THINGS, WHY DIDN'T YOU TRY AND STOP HER?
BECAUSE YOU LET HER DO WHATEVER SHE WANTS.
I DON'T.
YES, YOU DO.
I'M A LITTLE PRINCESS.
UH-OH.
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.
WHAT?
SHE'S OFF THE HOOK AGAIN?
SHE IS REALLY GOOD.
SHE'S NOT OFF THE HOOK.
OK, LITTLE PRINCESS, YOU AND I NEED TO TALK.
AM I IN BIG TROUBLE, MISTER?
YES, MA'AM.
STAND UP, PLEASE.
GIRLS, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE US FOR A MOMENT, I NEED TO TALK TO MICHELLE ABOUT HER VERY FIRST PUNISHMENT.
NAIL HER, DAD.
IF SHE TRIES TO PULL ANY OF THAT CUTE STUFF, THINK OF YOUR WET SHOE.
I'LL REMEMBER THAT.
MICHELLE, YOU'VE HAD IT PRETTY EASY AROUND HERE.
I LIKE IT HERE.
WELL, THINGS ARE ABOUT TO CHANGE.
THE TRUTH IS, MICHELLE, YOU'RE VERY, VERY SPECIAL TO ME BECAUSE YOU'RE MY LAST LITTLE BABY, AND I GUESS, IN A WAY, I WANTED YOU TO STAY THAT WAY.
BUT I GOTTA FACE IT.
YOU'RE A BIG GIRL NOW.
SO IF YOU DO SOMETHING WRONG, YOU'RE OLD ENOUGH TO BE PUNISHED.
IS IT OVER NOW?
NO.
LISTENING TO ME TALK IS NOT PUNISHMENT ALTHOUGH IT DOES SEEM TO HELP YOU GO TO SLEEP.
HONEY, I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW I'M ONLY DOING THIS BECAUSE I LOVE YOU.
I LOVE YOU, DADDY.
OHH.
WAIT A MINUTE.
MY SHOE IS WET.
OK.
MY SHOE IS WET.
MY SHOE IS WET.
MY SHOE IS WET.
IT'S WET.
I CAN FEEL IT.
* THIS IS NO FUN * * NO FUN * * LOOKING AT THE WALL ** MICHELLE YES, DADDY?
ARE YOU READY TO BE A GOOD GIRL NOW?
I'LL BE A VERY GOOD GIRL.
GOOD.
AND DID YOU LEARN A LESSON FROM ALL OF THIS?
YES, I DID.
NO SWIMMING IN THE KITCHEN.
YES, NO SWIMMING IN THE KITCHEN, THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT LESSON, BUT THERE'S A BIGGER LESSON HERE.
DADDY, UNCLE JESSE, AND JOEY, WE KNOW WHAT'S BEST FOR YOU, SO HONEY, WHEN WE ASK YOU TO DO SOMETHING, YOU SHOULD DO IT.
DEAL?
YOU'RE THE BOSS.
OK, THEN, PUNISHMENT IS OVER.
TIME TO PLAY!
NO, IT'S NOT.
TIME FOR BED.
CAN WE WATCH ARSENIO?
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
I THINK IT'S TIME FOR BED.
YOU THINK RIGHT.
IT'S TIME FOR BED.
TO BED, I SAID.
DADDY, AM I STILL YOUR LITTLE PRINCESS?
OH, YOU GOT IT, DUDE.
AHH.

I HAVE A HORRIBLE COLD.
I'LL MAKE YOU ALL BETTER.
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE THIS.
WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU DOING?
MAKING YOU A CHICKEN SOUP.
ARE YOU READY TO PITCH THAT BIG ACCOUNT TODAY, JESS?
LOOKING GOOD, JOSEPH.
LOOKING SHARP, JESS.
I'M PUMPED.
I'M PSYCHED.
HOLD IT.
I'M NOT GOING IN THERE WITH A DENTED HEAD.
GOOD THINKING.
STEPH, GIVE MY LOVE TO THE THIRD GRADE.
WE'RE OUT OF HERE.
WE'RE GONE.
AH-CHOO!
AH-CHOO!
AH-CHOO!
WE'RE BACK.
DON'T WORRY.
IT'S JUST MY NOSE, MY THROAT, MY EARS, MY CHEST.
I'M FALLING APART.
THAT'S IT.
NO SCHOOL FOR YOU TODAY, YOUNG LADY.
GET YOUR PJs ON AND UP TO BED.
BUT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO SEE A FILMSTRIP ON HOW THEY MAKE CHEESE.
YOU KNOW, THAT BED IS SOUNDING BETTER AND BETTER.
FINISH YOUR SOUP, YOUNG LADY!
HOWDY, BOYS.
OH, GOOD.
KIMMY'S GONE COUNTRY.
D.J.!
COMING!
HI, KIMMY.
OH, GUYS, I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE.
I'M IN CHARGE OF CAREER DAY.
WILL YOU GUYS COME DOWN TO MY SCHOOL NEXT WEEK AND TALK ABOUT ADVERTISING?
YEAH, SURE, DEEJ.
WE'RE THERE FOR YOU, BABE.
I'M THERE FOR YOU TOO, BABE.
WELL, THANKS, DAD, BUT YOU'RE PROBABLY BUSY.
OH, I'M NEVER TOO BUSY TO INSPIRE THE YOUTH OF AMERICA.
I GUESS THIS IS WHERE IT PAYS OFF REALLY BIG HAVING A DAD WHO'S THE STAR OF WAKE UP, SAN FRANCISCO, HUH?
TELL HIM.
I CAN'T.
LOOK HOW HAPPY HE IS.
YEAH, HE IS HAPPY.
I'LL TELL HIM.
WE DON'T NEED YOU, MR.
T. WE ALREADY BOOKED A BIG TV STAR.
BIGGER THAN ME?
JIMMY CHUNG SAID HE COULD GET HIS AUNT CONNIE.
CONNIE CHUNG?
YOU BOOKED CONNIE CHUNG FOR CAREER DAY?
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET HER ON MY SHOW FOR YEARS.
TELL YOU WHAT, HAVE YOUR PEOPLE CALL MY PEOPLE.
D.J I KNOW, DAD.
MAKE KNEW FRIENDS.
WE WOULD REALLY LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR SWITCHING THE MEETING TO OUR HOUSE.
YES.
I'M SURE YOU'LL FIND IT WAS WORTH THE INCONVENIENCE.
I'M SURE I WILL.
I'M GONNA GO GET READY IN THE GETTING READY AREA.
EXCUSE ME.
WAIT TILL YOU SEE WHAT MY BOYS HAVE COOKED UP FOR YOU.
TAKE IT AWAY, GLADSTONE.
THANK YOU, MR.
MALATESTA.
MS.
GARLAND, MY PARTNER AND I ARE GONNA MAKE YOUR NEW MEN'S COLOGNE, I.Q., THE SMELL OF THE NINETIES.
JOEY!
JOEY, THE SNEEZE JUICE IS BACKING UP INTO MY EARS.
EXCUSE US.
IT'S TIME FOR HER NOSE DROPS.
OK, TILT BACK, STEPH.
SHE'S VERY LIMBER.
OK, FIRE ONE.
FIRE TWO.
IT'S WORKING.
HEY, I CAN BREATHE AGAIN.
SOMETHING'S REALLY STINKY.
HA HA HA!
WELL, WE KNOW IT'S NOT THE SMELL OF THE NINETIES.
THERE YOU ARE.
I MADE YOU SOME ORANGE JUICE.
IT, UH SURE DOES LOOK FRESH.
YOU, BACK TO BED.
RIGHT NOW.
MOVE IT!
BUT MICHELLE I SAID MOVE IT, MISTER!
KIDS!
OK, WE FADE IN ON AN ELEGANT LIBRARY.
WE PAN OVER TO A PORTRAIT OF A GODDESS DRAPED IN BUT A WISP OF CHIFFON.
AS THE CLASSICAL MUSIC SWELLS, A GREAT INTELLECT ENTERS-- THE SUAVE, CLASSY, DEBONAIR I.Q. MAN.
I WANT TO KNOW IF I CAN LIVE WITH WHAT I KNOW.
AND ONLY THAT.
AS THE I.Q. MAN PONDERS THAT THOUGHT HMM A DREAMLIKE MIST FILLS THE ROOM.
SUDDENLY THE GODDESS IN THE PAINTING COMES TO LIFE.
SHE'S DRAWN TO THE I.Q. MAN BY A MYSTERIOUS POWER.
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT HIM I CAN'T RESIST.
IS IT HIS EYES?
IS IT HIS SMILE?
IS IT-- STOP!
IF YOU MUST LOVE ME LOVE ME FOR MY I.Q. I.Q. NOW AVAILABLE IN BIODEGRADABLE ROLL-ON.
THAT MADE ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE AT ALL.
IT'S THE PERFECT COLOGNE AD.
YOU GOT THE JOB.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU.
THANKS VERY MUCH.
JESSE AND I WILL DIRECT THE COMMERCIAL.
RIGHT?
AND WE'LL FIND THE PERFECT I.Q. MAN FOR YOU.
OH, YOU'VE ALREADY FOUND HIM.
YOU.
ME?
AHEM.
ME?
NO, I'M NOT A MODEL.
YOU'RE HOT.
NAH.
YOU'RE SEXY.
NO.
YOU'VE GOT GREAT HAIR.
OK, YOU GOT ONE.
BUT NO, I WOULD FEEL SILLY.
HE WOULD LOVE TO DO THIS.
WONDERFUL.
EXCUSE US A SECOND, WON'T YOU?
JOSEPH.
I'M NOT DOING THIS.
I'M NOT GONNA PRANCE AROUND LIKE SOME SMILING SLAB OF BEEF.
JESS, THIS IS THE BIGGEST BREAK OF OUR CAREERS.
NOW, DON'T BLOW IT JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE THIS WEIRD HANG-UP ABOUT BEEF.
KATSOPOLIS, LET ME EXPLAIN YOUR OPTIONS TO YOU.
EITHER YOU DO IT, YOU DO IT OR YOU DO IT.
WHAT WAS THE SECOND ONE AGAIN?
HI, DAD.
HOLA, BECKY.
HI GIRLS.
WELL, HAVE A GREAT CAREER DAY.
SEND MY REGARDS TO CONNIE CHUNG.
BOY, MR.
T., YOU SURE DO LOOK SNAPPY IN EARTH TONES.
WHAT DO YOU WANT, GIBBLER?
DAD, REMEMBER JIMMY CHUNG, THE PATHOLOGICAL LIAR?
OH, I'M JUST TAKING A SHOT, BUT HE COULDN'T GET HIS AUNT CONNIE, HUH?
HE DOESN'T HAVE AN AUNT CONNIE.
HIS NAME'S NOT EVEN CHUNG.
WELL WHAT DO YOU KNOW?
LOOKS LIKE YOU TWO ARE IN THE MARKET FOR A MAJOR TV STAR.
OH, KIMMY, KIMMY, KIMMY.
WHY DON'T YOU HAVE YOUR PEOPLE CALL MY PEOPLE?
I'LL DO IT.
THANKS, BECKY.
BE THERE RIGHT AFTER LUNCH.
OK.
WHOA, GIRLS, UH CAN'T A GUY MAKE A JOKE?
YOU KNOW I DON'T HAVE ANY PEOPLE.
YOU'RE MY PEOPLE.
IT'S OK, DAD.
YOU CAN DO IT.
I SHOULD'VE ASKED YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE.
I JUST GOT CAUGHT UP IN CHUNG-MANIA.
OH, DIDN'T WE ALL.
WHAT IS THIS?
THIS ISN'T WHAT WE ORDERED.
WE ORDERED A LIBRARY SET, NOT A BATHROOM SET.
OK, STRIKE IT.
STRIKE THE SET.
WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS?
THIS WAS MS.
GARLAND'S IDEA.
OK, PEOPLE, BACK TO WORK.
COME ON, LET'S MOVE IT.
LET'S GO.
I JUST COULDN'T SEE THE I.Q. MAN IN A LIBRARY.
IN FACT, THE MORE I THOUGHT ABOUT IT, THE MORE I SAW YOU IN THE SHOWER.
WHY WOULD I WEAR A SMOKING JACKET IN THE SHOWER?
EXACTLY.
THAT'S WHY YOU'LL BE WEARING THIS.
AND ACTION!
I WANT TO KNOW IF I CAN LIVE WITH WHAT I KNOW AND ONLY THAT.
CUT, CUT, CUT, CUT, CUT.
JESS, THE CONCEPT IS THE I.Q. MAN, NOT THE I.Q. HEAD.
TOO BAD.
THE HEAD'S ALL YOU'RE GETTING.
MAYBE ICE COLD WATER WILL HELP HIM OVER HIS SHYNESS.
OHH!
OK, OK!
I'M OUT!
I'M OUT!
GOOD.
NO, NO.
NO NEED TO DRY OFF.
IN FACT, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOUR BODY WETTER.
THE WETTER, THE BETTER.
EXCUSE US, WON'T YOU?
JOSEPH, HOP ON.
YOU SEE?
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
I'M NOTHING BUT A BIG MAC IN A BATH TOWEL.
JOEY, I'M NOT A HAMBURGER.
I HAPPEN TO BE A HUMAN BEING.
JESS, BUDDY, AS LONG AS I'M THE DIRECTOR, YOU WILL BE TREATED WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT.
THANK YOU.
OK, HOSE HIM DOWN.
HOLD IT!
WATCH THE HAIR.
EXCUSE ME.
TAKE TWO.
OK, THIS TIME, GIVE ME MORE STEAM.
AND ACTION!
I WANT--  I WANT TO KNOW IF I CAN LIVE--  WITH WHAT I KNOW AND ONLY THAT.
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT HIM I CAN'T RESIST.
IS IT HIS EYES?
IS IT HIS SMILE?
IS IT HIS-- STOP.
IF YOU MUST LOVE ME, LOVE ME FOR MY I-- MY I-- I'M IN A BATH TOWEL.
I'M IN A BATH TOWEL HERE.
COME ON, JESSE, WHAT IS THE PROBLEM?
IT'S NOT WORKING, OK?
HE'S RIGHT, IT'S NOT WORKING.
THANK YOU.
THAT TOWEL'S MUCH TOO BIG.
CUT.
CUT.
NOT YOU!
NOT YOU!
JESSE I WON'T HURT YOU.
MALATESTA, WILL YOU HELP ME OUT HERE, PLEASE?
SHE'S THE CLIENT.
SHE'S CHASING ME WITH SCISSORS.
SO?
STOP RUNNING.
I WON'T STAND HERE AND BE EXPLOITED BY YOU.
KATSOPOLIS, AS LONG AS YOU'RE WORKING FOR ME, YOU WILL DO EXACTLY WHAT SHE SAYS.
OK.
FROM NOW ON, WE DON'T WORK FOR YOU.
WE QUIT.
YOU'RE MAKING A BIG MISTAKE.
THE BIGGEST MISTAKE I EVER MADE WAS WORKING FOR A SPINELESS JELLYFISH LIKE YOU.
WHAT?
UH, SIR, YOU KNOW, IN MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD, A SPINELESS JELLYFISH IS CONSIDERED A DELICACY.
LET'S GO.
YOU'RE A GOOD MAN, GLADSTONE.
YOU KNOW JUST WHEN TO KISS UP.
I AM A KISS-UP, AREN'T I?
ONE OF THE BEST.
I SOLD YOU OUT, DIDN'T I?
JOEY, YOU HOSED ME DOWN.
JOSEPH, WE'RE PARTNERS AND FRIENDS.
THIS MAN IS NOT A HAMBURGER, AND I AM NOT A SIDE OF FRIES, AND YOU, SIR, ARE A CHICKEN McNUGGET!
JOEY, ARE YOU GOING TO QUIT OR ORDER A HAPPY MEAL?
WE'RE QUITTING.
THAT'S MY PARTNER.
COME ON.
WE GOT BETTER PLACES TO BE.
WE JUST LOST OUR JOBS.
WHERE ARE WE GOING?
CAREER DAY.
THANKS MR.
KRAUS FOR INTRODUCING US TO THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF MEAT.
AND NOW, AS WE MOVE INTO THE FIELD OF TV ENTERTAINMENT, I'LL LIKE TO APOLOGIZE ONCE AGAIN FOR THE UNFORTUNATE CONNIE CHUNG INCIDENT.
MAN!
AW, MAN!
BUT, JUST AS EXCITING, WE HAVE THE CO-HOSTS OF WAKE UP, SAN FRANCISCO.
LET'S GIVE IT UP FOR DANNY TANNER AND REBECCA DONALDSON!
HOO!
HOO!
HOO!
HOO!
HOO!
HOO HOO WHO ARE RIGHT HERE.
WAKE UP, VAN ATTA JUNIOR HIGH.
I'M DANNY TANNER.
AND I'M REBECCA DONALDSON.
AND THIS IS BASICALLY WHAT WE DO-- WE TALK TO EACH OTHER AND TO OUR GUESTS, AND WE LISTEN, AND WE FINISH EACH OTHER'S SENTENCES.
OK.
NOW, LOOKING AS I AM RIGHT NOW AT YOUR BEAUTIFUL, SHINY, ROUND LITTLE FACES, I'M REMINDED OF MY FIRST JOB IN TELEVISION.
I WAS ASSISTANT STOCK BOY AT ANTENNA TOWN.
AND, YOU KNOW, IT REMINDS ME OF A LONG STORY-- DANNY, LOOK.
OUR FIRST QUESTION.
HOW TALL IS CONNIE CHUNG?
CONNIE CHUNG IS NOT HERE.
I AM, AND I'M 6'4".
THANKS A LOT.
YEAH, BUT IF SHE WERE HERE, HOW TALL WOULD SHE BE?
WHO DOES CONNIE'S HAIR?
YEAH.
THAT'S IT!
LET'S FACE IT.
CONNIE CHUNG COULDN'T MAKE IT, SO JUST GET OVER IT.
OH, LOOK WHO'S HERE.
FROM AN EXCITING WORLD OF ADVERTISING, JESSE KATSOPOLIS AND JOEY GLADSTONE.
COME ON DOWN!
THANKS, GUYS.
"THANKS, GUYS"?
THAT'S IT FOR ME AND REBECCA?
THE BUTCHER HAD 10 MINUTES.
SORRY DAD, BUT CLASS IS ALMOST OVER, AND THE BUTCHER GAVE OUT MIDGET SALAMIS.
HEY, I'M NOT ABOVE BRIBES.
IN FACT THIS KIDS WOULD LIKE SOME AUTOGRAPHED PICTURES OF ME.
I BROUGHT THE PICTURES I HAVE A SPECIAL FELT MARKER AND EVERYTHING.
DANNY, IT'S OVER.
TAKE IT AWAY, BOYS.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
THANKS.
THANK YOU.
HI.
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU REALLY STOP AND THINK ABOUT IT, THIS WHOLE CAREER THING IS OVERRATED.
I MEAN, THERE ARE MORE IMPORTANT THINGS IN LIFE.
RIGHT, JOEY?
SURE, LIKE A WELL-BALANCED BREAKFAST.
RIGHT.
AND REALLY COOL SUNGLASSES.
YEAH, AND STRONG WATER PRESSURE IN THE SHOWER.
THAT'S A GOOD ONE.
YEAH.
THAT WOULD BE DID YOU GUYS LOSE YOUR JOBS OR SOMETHING?
ZIP IT, GIBBLER.
WE HAVE SOMETHING MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN JOBS.
YEAH.
WE HAVE OUR INTEGRITY.
HOW MUCH DOES THAT PAY AN HOUR?
SO REMEMBER, KIDS, ALWAYS KEEP YOUR HEADS HELD HIGH AND ALWAYS CARRY EXACT BUS CHANGE.
AND REMEMBER, NO RUNNING IN THE HALLWAYS.
I THINK YOU REALLY MOVED THEM.
YEAH.
I FEEL SO BAD FOR YOU GUYS.
WHAT HAPPENED?
OH, OUR BOSS JUST PUSHED US TOO FAR.
WE QUIT.
LOOK, I'M THE LAST ONE TO GIVE ADVICE.
OK, I'M THE FIRST ONE.
MAYBE YOU SHOULD GO INTO BUSINESS FOR YOURSELVES.
YOU COULD WRITE AND MARKET YOUR OWN COMMERCIALS AND DIRECT THEM FOR YOUR OWN PRODUCTION COMPANY.
YEAH, WE JUST LEARNED ABOUT THIS.
WHY DON'T YOU GUYS GET A SMALL BUSINESS LOAN?
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.
I MEAN, YOU'VE GOT THE EXPERIENCE, THE TALENT, THE CONTACTS.
ALL YOU NEED IS TO RENT SOME EQUIPMENT.
AND FIND SOME STUDIO SPACE.
AND PRINT UP BUSINESS CARDS.
THAT'S IT!
WE'RE IN BUSINESS!
CONGRATULATIONS!
WE HAVE OUR OWN BUSINESS.
WHAT THE HELL JUST HAPPENED?
TISSUE, TISSUE, TISSUE.
AH-CHOO!
THANK YOU.
HOW RUDE.
YOU GAVE ME YOUR COLD.
TAKE IT BACK.
NO CAN DO.
ONCE IT'S OUT OF MY NOSE, IT'S OUT OF MY HANDS.
HI, GIRLS.
HI, JOEY.
HI, JOEY.
HOW ARE YOU, MICHELLE?
SHE MAKES ME SICK.
WHAT SHE MEANS IS I GAVE HER MY COLD.
WELL, I'M SORRY YOU GOT STEPHIE'S COLD, BUT YOU KNOW THE GOOD NEWS?
SINCE YOU TOOK SUCH GOOD CARE OF STEPHIE, I'M SURE STEPHIE'S GONNA TAKE REALLY GOOD CARE OF YOU.
RIGHT, STEPH?
NICE GUILT TRIP, JOEY.
YEAH, IT WAS, WASN'T IT?
BYE, GIRLS.
IN THE WORDS OF MICHELLE TANNER, "YOU, UPSTAIRS, INTO BED.
MOVE IT, MISTER.
MOVE IT".
CHILL OUT, DUDE.
HEY JOEY, BAD NEWS FOR DOUBLE "J" CREATIVE SERVICES-- THE BANK TURNED DOWN OUR BUSINESS LOAN.
HOW COULD THEY DO THAT?
OH, I DON'T KNOWN, MAYBE 'CAUSE WE HAVE NO EXPERIENCE RUNNING OUR OWN BUSINESS, NO COLLATERAL, NO CREDIT RATING.
WHY DO YOU THINK THEY TURNED US DOWN?
HEY, JUST 'CAUSE YOU'RE CRANKY AND UNEMPLOYED, DON'T TAKE IT OUT ON ME.
GUYS, I HEARD ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED AT THE BANK.
AND I THINK I HAVE A WAY TO MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.
I DON'T KNOW, DON'T TELL ME YOU GONNA SING THE IMPOSSIBLE DREAM AGAIN.
NO.
I AM JUST GONNA HUM IT WHILE YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
THIS IS A PERSONAL CHECK FROM DANNY TANNER.
DANNY, STOP HUMMING!
WHY ARE YOU GIVING US ALL THIS MONEY?
'CAUSE I BELIEVE IN YOU GUYS.
AFTER ALL YOU'VE DONE FOR ME, I'M HAPPY TO DO THIS FOR YOU.
BUT THIS-- THIS IS NOT A GIFT IT'S AN INVESTMENT.
I WANNA BE A PARTNER IN YOUR SUCCESS.
DANNY, THIS IS BEAUTIFUL.
WOW, THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY.
YOU'RE SO-- DID YOU SAY PARTNER?
WELL, SILENT PARTNER.
COME ON, WHAT DO YOU SAY?
I'LL BE TOTALLY CLOSE-MOUTHED.
NO BUTTING IN, I'LL KEEP MY NOSE OUT OF IT, MIND MY OWN BUSINESS.
MY LIPS ARE SEALED.
NOT A PEEP OUT OF ME.
IF YOU'D SHUT UP FOR ONE MINUTE, WE COULD TELL YOU THAT YOU'RE IN.
YEAH?
ALL RIGHT!

WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?
I THINK I KNOW.
THOSE SLUMBER PARTIES-- THEY'RE FOR MOTHERS AND DAUGHTERS.
I REMEMBER WHEN PAM TOOK D.J. POOR STEPH.
BECKY, I JUST GOT AN IDEA.
THIS MIGHT BE A LOT TO ASK.
DANNY, IT'S NO PROBLEM.
I WOULD LOVE TO TAKE STEPHANIE TO THE SLUMBER PARTY.
I'LL BE IN LAKE TAHOE ON SATURDAY AFTERNOON BUT I'LL MAKE SURE I'M BACK IN PLENTY OF TIME.
THANK YOU, BECKY.

I BETTER BE THERE, TOO.
HI, MICHELLE.
HI, BECKY.
HI, DADDY.
HI, JOEY.
HI, UNCLE JERSE.
STEPH?
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TALK TO ME.
I'M OK.
WELL, I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT THAT SLUMBER PARTY.
SLUMBER PARTIES ARE SO DUMB.
IT'S JUST A BUNCH OF PEOPLE SLEEPING ON THE FLOOR.
JEEZ, I'M SORRY YOU FEEL THAT WAY BECAUSE YOU KNOW, I WAS HOPING THAT YOU AND I WE COULD GO TO THAT SLUMBER PARTY TOGETHER.
REALLY?
YOU'D GO WITH ME?
WE'RE GONNA GET TO SLEEP ON THE FLOOR!
THANKS, BECKY.
I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL SATURDAY.

IT'LL MAKE A GREAT STUDIO.
JUST HAVE TO GET RID OF ALL THIS JUNK.
JUNK?
THIS IS MY LIFE, MY MOST CHERISHED TREASURES, ARRANGED BY DECADE AND IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER, FROM MY ANT FARM TO MY ZORRO SWORD.
THIS IS YOUR LIFE?
DEAD ANTS AND A PLASTIC SWORD?
OK, IT'S A SAD LIFE, BUT IT'S MY LIFE.
ALL RIGHT.
I GOT AN IDEA.
THIS SATURDAY YOU HAVE A YARD SALE AND THE MONEY THAT YOU MAKE YOU CAN BUY YOURSELF A NEW LIFE.

WELL, THE MATTRESS IS A LITTLE SOFT, BUT I CAN ROUGH IT.
GET YOUR BONY BOD OFF MY BED.
OH, I FORGOT TO MENTION THIS.
SINCE YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE HERE, KIMMY'S GONNA SLEEP IN YOUR BED.
EEW.
GIBBLER DROOL ON MY PILLOW.
I'M GONNA COVER MY BED WITH SARAN WRAP.
WHOA.
THIS COULD BE A PRETTY SCARY THING TO WAKE UP TO.
PATRICK SWAYZE-- NOW THAT SAYS GOOD MORNING.
UNCLE JESSE, LET'S GO SHOPPING.
WELL, LITTLE MUNCHKIN, I JUST HAVE TO FIND OUT WHERE WE'RE GONNA GO.
TO THE MALL.
LET'S MOVE IT, MISTER.

I'LL DRIVE.
GET BACK HERE, YOU SHORTY.
COME BACK!
DANNY, HOW IS IT GOING?
WHAT HAVE YOU SOLD SO FAR?
NOT A THING.
ISN'T THAT CRAZY?
WHAT'S CRAZY ARE THESE PRICES.
$70 FOR AN OLD BOWLING TROPHY?
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW YOU WERE A GOOD BOWLER.
I'M NOT.
I WON THIS TROPHY FOR CLEANEST BALL.
OH, COME ON.
$185 FOR A PAIR OF PLATFORM SHOES?
THAT'S A BARGAIN.
I WAS WEARING THESE SHOES WHEN I LEARNED TO DANCE THE HUSTLE.
I WAS DOING GREAT, TOO, TILL SMACKED MY HEAD ON A DISCO BALL.
ALL RIGHT.
SHE'S BACK, AND SHE'S COOLER THAN EVER.
YO!

WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO MY BABY?
NOTHING.
I FOUND THIS STORE-- HELL'S LITTLE ANGELS.
I GOT A TATTOO.
JESSE, I'LL KILL YOU.
RELAX.
IT WASHES OFF.
"BORN TO BEHAVE"?
SHE WANTS TO BE LIKE HER UNCLE JESSE.
PLEASE TAKE OVER THE SALE.
NO DISCOUNTS.
COME ON, MICHELLE, WE'RE GOING SHOPPING AT THE TEENY TINY TOT SHOP.
HOW ABOUT IT, SWEETIE?
COME ON, DANNY, SHE'S GONNA BE THE HOTTEST BABE IN SCHOOL.
JESS, SHE GOES TO PRESCHOOL, NOT REFORM SCHOOL.
LET'S ROLL, DADDY-O.
OK, HONEY.

I FEEL TERRIBLE.
IT'S OK.
THANKS ANYWAY.

I DIDN'T WANT TO GO TO THAT PARTY ANYWAY, COMET.
JUST A BUNCH OF GIRLS WITH THEIR MOMS.
HOW BORING.
WE'LL HAVE MUCH MORE FUN BY OURSELVES.
RIGHT, COMET?
STEPH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
BECKY'S GONNA BE HERE ANY MINUTE.
NO, SHE'S NOT.
HER CAR BROKE DOWN IN PLACERVILLE.
OH, STEPH, THAT'S AWFUL.

I LIKE THIS DRESS.
I PICKED IT OUT MYSELF.
YEAH, BUT YOU LIKE THE STUFF THAT I PICKED BETTER, RIGHT?
NAH.
YOU DIDN'T LIKE THOSE BIKER CLOTHES?
I LIKED THEM FOR HALLOWEEN.
OH, NO.
I DID TO YOU WHAT MY DAD USED TO DO TO ME.
HE ALWAYS DRESSED ME UP JUST LIKE HIM.
ALWAYS MADE ME WEAR THESE MUNCHKIN LEISURE SUITS, HE WAS TRYING TO ACHIEVE THAT "DAD AND LAD" LOOK.
TO THIS DAY, I HAVE NIGHTMARES OF WHITE BELTS AND MATCHING SHOES.
I'M SORRY I TRIED DOING THE SAME THING TO YOU, PAL.

I THINK YOU LOOK LIKE A LITTLE PRINCESS.

BESIDES, THAT BLOND LADY CUT ME OFF.
I KNEW THIS WAS A BAD IDEA.
LET'S PLAY BEAUTY PARLOR!
DAUGHTERS MAKE UP MOMS, THEN MOMS MAKE UP DAUGHTERS.
YEAH!
GREAT IDEA!
NO, THIS WORKS OUT GREAT.
I'VE BEEN WANTING TO HIGHLIGHT THESE CHEEKBONES A LITTLE.
UM, WHY DON'T WE SKIP BEAUTY PARLOR AND PLAY SOMETHING ELSE.

BECAUSE OF ME, THAT'S WHY!
STEPH.

STEPHANIE.
STEPH, WOULD YOU JUST STOP AND TALK TO ME?
THERE'S NOTHING TO TALK ABOUT.
I DON'T HAVE A MOTHER AND THERE'S NOTHING YOU GUYS CAN SAY TO CHANGE THAT, RIGHT?
SEE?
I BETTER GO DEAL WITH THIS.
I'LL NEVER EAT ANOTHER CHEESY YUM YUM AS LONG AS I LIVE.
I WANT MY BED BACK.
STEPH, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE GONE TONIGHT.
IT WAS A STUPID PARTY WITH STUPID PEOPLE AND MOTHER-DAUGHTER MAKEOVERS.
UH, KIMMY, CAN I HAVE A WORD WITH STEPH ALONE?
I'M OUTTA HERE.
STEPH?
JUST FORGET IT.
DAD, CAN I HAVE A MINUTE ALONE WITH MY SISTER?
SURE, DEEJ.
I'LL BE DOWNSTAIRS.
I'M SORRY YOU HAD SUCH A BAD TIME TONIGHT.
I KNOW EXACTLY HOW YOU FEEL.
NO, YOU DON'T.
WHEN YOU WERE 8, YOU GOT TO GO TO THE HONEYBEE SLUMBER PARTY WITH MOM.
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN I DON'T MISS HER JUST AS MUCH AS YOU DO.
IT'S NOT FAIR!
ALL THOSE GIRLS WITH THEIR MOMS TONIGHT WERE SO HAPPY.
WHY COULDN'T I BE HAPPY, TOO?
STEPH, IT'S OK.
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES I LOOK AT OTHER GIRLS WITH THEIR MOMS AND FEEL THE SAME WAY.
HOW DO YOU MAKE THE FEELING GO AWAY?
IT'S HARD.
BUT SOMETHING THAT HELPS ME IS WELL, I THINK OF THE THINGS WE DO HAVE THAT OTHER PEOPLE DON'T HAVE.
LIKE WHAT?
WELL, WE HAVE THREE PEOPLE THAT LOVE US A LOT.
WE'RE THE ONLY ONES WITH A DAD, AN UNCLE JESSE, AND A JOEY.
AND WE HAVE SOMETHING ELSE, TOO.
WE DO?
WE HAVE EACH OTHER.
STEPH MUST HATE ME FOR DRAGGING HER TO THAT SLUMBER PARTY.
AW, COME ON, JOEY, YOUR HEART WAS IN THE RIGHT PLACE.
YEAH, SHE'LL THANK YOU FOR ITSOMEDAY.
JOEY, THANKS FOR TAKING ME TO THAT PARTY TONIGHT.
BOY, "SOMEDAY" CAME PRETTY FAST.
YOU OK, STEPH?
YEAH, I FEEL BETTER.
I'M SORRY I RAN OUT LIKE THAT.
I MEAN, YOU WERE PLAYING WITH BARBIES, JUMPING ROPE, WEARING HIGH HEELS.
AND YOU DID IT ALL FOR ME.
US HONEYBEES, WE GOTTA STICK TOGETHER.
LET'S GO, STEPH.
WE'RE GONNA GO BACK TO THE SLUMBER PARTY.
STEPH, ARE YOU SURE YOU WANNA GO BACK?
YEAH.
WE'RE GONNA DO MAKEOVERS TOGETHER.
HOW WOULD I LOOK IN YOUR PASSION PLUM EYE SHADOW?
IT'S YOU, BABE.

YEAH, AND THAT'S A PRETTY TERRIFIC PAIR OF JAMMIES YOU GOT THERE.
NOW JOSEPH, TELL ME, I WANNA KNOW A LITTLE MORE ABOUT THIS JUMPING ROPE, PLAYING WITH BARBIES.

GIVE ME A JOB ON THAT PAPER, AND WE ARE GONNA RULE THE SCHOOL.
YOU WANNA WORK ON THE PAPER?
I'VE NEVER EVEN SEEN YOU READ A PAPER.
I READ PAPERS WHENEVER I'M IN LINE AT THE SUPERMARKET.
WELL, I DON'T THINK WE'RE GONNA NEED ANY ARTICLES ABOUT FINDING ELVIS ON MARS.
IT WAS VENUS.
COME ON, I NEED AN EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITY SO IT LOOKS LIKE I CARE ABOUT THE STUPID SCHOOL.
WELL, KIMMY, I'D REALLY LIKE TO PUT YOU ON THE PAPER, BUT THE ONLY THING LEFT IS SPORTS EDITOR.
THAT'S PERFECT FOR ME.
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT SPORTS.
SURE I DO.
MY MOM USED TO BE A PROFESSIONAL WRESTLER.
PLEASE?
YOU'RE MY BEST BEST BEST FRIEND.
OH, NOT THE PUPPY DOG FACE.
OH NOT THE WHIMPER.
OK, YOU'VE GOT THE JOB.
JUST DON'T LICK MY FACE.

DANNY, WE'RE GOING CRAZY.
WE NEED A JOB.
ANY WORD ABOUT US SHOOTING THAT COMMERCIAL FOR WAKE UP, SAN FRANCISCO?
LET ME TELL THEM.
I WANNA TELL THEM.
YOU ALWAYS GET TO TELL THEM.
SOMEBODY TELL US.
OK, WE'LL TELL THEM ON 3.
READY?
YOU GOT THE JOB.
YOU CHEATED!
WE GOT THE JOB?
UH-HUH.
YES!
THANKS, DANNY.
YOUR WELCOME.
ALL RIGHT!
OUR FIRST JOB AT OUR VERY OWN PRODUCTION COMPANY.
THAT'S RIGHT.
OUR COMMERCIAL IS GONNA HAVE THE WHOLE TOWN PSYCHED UP FOR THE NEW WAKE UP, SAN FRANCISCO STARRING REBECCA DONALDSON AND DANNY TANNER.
NOW, LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT WE GOT WORKED OUT HERE, CHECK THIS OUT, YOU GUYS.
WE OPEN UP WITH A BED ON THE SET, RIGHT?
JESS, EXCUSE ME, THIS IS-- THIS IS SMALL ITSY-BITSY POINT, AND IT'S HARDLY WORTH MENTIONING, BUT I CAN SEE THAT YOU'RE WONDERING IT'S-- IT'S ALWAYS BEEN "STARRING DANNY TANNER AND REBECCA DONALDSON".
OK, BACK TO OUR STORY-- START WITH THE BED-- OF COURSE ONE COULD MAKE THE ARGUMENT, THOUGH NO ONE HERE IS ARGUING, THAT SINCE THE SHOW IS CHANGING ITS IMAGE, OTHER CHANGES MIGHT BE LONG OVERDUE.
I THOUGHT WE DISCUSSED ALL THE CHANGES THAT NEEDED CHANGING.
IF YOU'RE MAKING CHANGES FOR SAKE OF CHANGES, WELL, THAT CHANGES EVERYTHING, DOESN'T IT?
DANNY, I JUST THOUGHT THE SHOW WOULD BE A LITTLE MORE BALANCED IF, LET'S SAY, WELL, I TALKED A LITTLE MORE AND YOU TALKED A LITTLE LESS.
WELL, MAYBE I DO GO ON A BIT, BUT YOU ALWAYS SEEM TO ENJOY IT.
YOU'RE ALWAYS SITTING THERE HAPPY AND, HUH, PERKY.
YOU GOT A PROBLEM WITH PERKY?
PERKY'S GREAT.
MAYBE IT'S A COFFEE THING.
MAYBE YOU'VE BEEN DRINKING A LOT OF COFFEE.
MAYBE WE COULD DO THIS WITH PUPPETS.
YEAH, I THINK LITTLE HAND PUPPETS.
ARTICLES.
THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
HEY, BITTERMAN, YOU GOT YOUR ARTICLE?
SOME ARTICLE.
I MEAN, ALL I DO IS COPY THE MENU FROM THE SCHOOL CAFETERIA.
COME ON, YOU WRITE THE MOST POPULAR COLUMN IN THE WHOLE PAPER-- TODAY'S LUNCH.
I SHOULD BE SPORTS EDITOR, NOT YOUR FRIEND KIMMY GIBBLER.
DEEJ, YOU'RE GONNA GO NUTS.
I GOT AN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH ROBBIE HAWKINS, THE STAR OF THE BASKETBALL TEAM.
ROBBIE HAWKINS ISN'T EVEN ON THE BASKETBALL TEAM.
HE'S THE EQUIPMENT MANAGER.
YEAH, BUT HE LOOKS SO CUTE PASSING OUT THESE LITTLE CUPS OF GATORADE.
SEE WHAT I MEAN?
WELL, I'M SURE IT'S A VERY WELL-WRITTEN ARTICLE WRITTEN ON A NAPKIN.
READ IT OUT LOUD.
THIS OUGHT TO BE GOOD.
WHAT'S FOR LUNCH, BITTERMAN?
"THIS DAY IN SPORTS "BY KIMBERLY LOUISE GIBBLER.
"EVER WONDER ABOUT THAT MEGA-CUTE GUY WHO'S ON THE BASKETBALL TEAM "WHO'S ALWAYS WIPING UP THE SWEAT PUDDLES?
"IT'S ROBBIE HAWKINS, "AND GIRLS, HE SPOTS THOSE PUDDLES WITH EYES OF BLUE, "NOT SKY-BLUE, "BUT MORE LIKE TURQUOISEY-GRAY-BLUE WITH LITTLE SPECKS OF GREEN"?
HOW'S THAT FOR INVESTIGATIVE REPORTING?
KIMMY, YOU FORGOT TO INVESTIGATE WHO WON THE GAME.
YOU'VE GOT TO REWRITE THIS.
REWRITE IT?
YOU MEAN WRITE IT AGAIN?
YES, WITH DIFFERENT WORDS-- WORDS ABOUT SPORTS.
IF YOU THINK I'M SO BAD, WHY YOU EVEN GIVE ME THE JOB?
I GAVE IT TO YOU BECAUSE WE'RE BEST FRIENDS.
THAT'S NEPOTISM.
IT IS NOT.
IT'S FAVORITISM.
IT'S STILL AN ISM.
LOOK, KIMMY, I NEED A NEW ARTICLE WRITTEN RIGHT AWAY.
THEN GO AHEAD AND WRITE ONE.
THAT'S YOUR JOB.
WHAT'S YOUR JOB-- QUEEN OF THE PAPER?
OOH OOH OOH LOOK, I'M THE EDITOR, AND I'M TELLING YOU TO DO THIS OVER.
NO WAY, I SKIPPED MY NAP IN ALGEBRA TO WRITE THAT.
I'M NOT DOING IT.
THEN I GUESS YOU'RE NOT SPORTS EDITOR.
THEN I GUESS WE'RE NOT FRIENDS.
FINE.
FINE.
FINE.
FINE.
AHH, NO MICHELLE.
AHH, NO MICHELLE.
GRR!
GRR!
SHE IS DRIVING ME BANANAS.
SHE IS DRIVING ME BANANAS.
STEPH, NOT NOW.
I'VE HAD A HORRIBLE DAY.
KIMMY AND I ARE NEVER SPEAKING TO EACH OTHER AGAIN.
GEE, THAT'S A SHAME.
GEE, THAT'S A SHAME.
OK, BIG SHOT, LET'S SEE YOU TRY AND HANDLE THIS.
I PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE TO THE FLAG OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND TO THE REPUBLIC FOR WHICH IT STANDS ONE NATION INDIVISIBLE, WITH LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL.
TRY THAT.
TRY THAT.
AYE, YI YI YI YI.
AYE, YI YI YI YI.
D.J., I THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID TO ME TODAY AND THAT'S WHY I WROTE THIS.
OH, KIMMY, YOU DID THE REWRITE ON REAL PAPER.
THE GIBBLER GAZETTE?
READ IT AND WEEP.
"POWER-HUNGRY EDITOR DONNA JO TANNER "STABS BEST FRIEND IN BACK.
ACTUAL PHOTO ON PAGE TWO".
YOU PASTED MY HEAD ON FREDDY KRUGER'S BODY?
HOW COULD YOU DO THAT?
THAT'S IT.
NOW OUR FRIENDSHIP IS REALLY OVER.
THANKS.
THAT FACE WILL LOOK GREAT ON FRED FLINTSTONE'S BODY.
OK, LET'S REHEARSE THIS OUT.
REMEMBER, YOU TWO ARE TWO TYPICAL SAN FRANCISCO VIEWERS, OK?
AND IT'S EARLY IN THE MORNING.
YOU'RE JUST WAKING UP.

AT THE RISK OF TALKING TOO MUCH, GUYS SHOULDN'T WE BE WAKING UP A LITTLE MORE NATURALLY?
SHE SHOOTING UP LIKE A POP TART IN A TOASTER.
OH!
WELL, EXCUSE ME FOR BEING SO PERKY, BUT I THOUGHT THE IDEA WAS TO WAKE UP WITH SOME ENERGY, RIGHT, PUMPKIN?
YES, SWEETHEART.
I'LL HANDLE HER.

COME ON, LET'S COMPROMISE HERE.
DANNY, WHEN YOU WAKE UP, WAKE UP A LITTLE MOREPOP TARTY.
ALL RIGHT, SWEETHEART, WHEN YOU WAKE UP TRY TO BE A LITTLE MORE STIFF, LIKE YOUR PARTNER.
OK, A LITTLE MORE MAKEUP FOR MISS DONALDSON, PLEASE.
ACCENTUATE THE CHEEKBONES.
VERY NICE.
WATCH THE HAIR.
THANK YOU, GIRLS.
HOW DO I LOOK?
DANNY, YOU'RE A FOX.
THANKS, JOEY.
ALL RIGHT, LET'S TRY IT AGAIN.
I FEEL A LOT OF LOVE IN THIS ROOM.
AND ACTION!
CUT!
AH!
LOOK, I' SORRY, JUST ONE MORE TEENSY-WEENSY LITTLE PROBLEM.
HOW COME ALL THE LIGHTS ARE OVER ON HER SIDE OF THE BED, AND I'M IN THE SHADOWS LIKE A TROLL UNDER A BRIDGE?
DANIEL, DANIEL, DANIEL.
WE-- WE FEEL THAT TOO MUCH LIGHT MAY ACCENTUATE THE ANGULARITY OF YOUR FEATURES.
ARE YOU SAYING MY NOSE IS TOO BIG?
NO, NO, NO, YOUR NOSE IS JUST THE RIGHT SIZE.
YOUR FACE IS JUST A LITTLE TOO SMALL.
AH!
GOOD ONE, HONEY.
THANK YOU, SWEETHEART.
OK, LET'S REHEARSE THIS BEGINNING TO END ONCE WITH NO STOPS PLEASE.
THAT'S RIGHT.
DANNY, PERK IT UP, BECKY, PERK IT DOWN.

HEY, I'M THE PERKY DANNY TANNER.
I'M THE STIFF REBECCA DONALDSON AND STARTING NEXT WEEK, YOU'LL SEEING A NEW AND IMPROVED WAKE UP, SAN FRANCISCO.

IT'S FRIENDLIER.
LET OUR HAPPY HOME BE A PART OF YOUR HAPPY HOME.
GET YOURSELF COMFORTABLE.
GRAB YOURSELF A CUP OF COFFEE AND A POP TART.
AND JOIN US EVERY MORNING AT 9:00 AS WE SAY WAKE UP, SAN FRANCISCO.
THAT LOOKED GOOD.
YEAH, IT WORKS FOR ME.
ARE YOU STILL TYPING?
ARE YOU STILL TYPING?
MICHELLE, AREN'T YOU TIRED OF THE SHADOW GAME YET?
NO WAY, JOSE.
NO WAY, JOSE.
HEY, THAT'S MY GAME.
HEY, THAT'S MY GAME.
I QUIT.

PLEASE GIVE ME MY LIFE BACK.
PLEASE GIVE ME MY LIFE BACK.
I LOVE THIS GAME.
HEY, DEEJ.
HEY, HOW'D IT GO?
WELL, WE SHOT A GREAT COMMERCIAL.
UNFORTUNATELY, IT TOOK US 24 COFFEE CUPS TO GET IT.
YOU KEEP SAYING IT'S MY FAULT.
IT'S NOT MY FAULT.
BECAUSE IT'S-- HEY, NO FIGHTING IN FRONT OF THE KID.
FINE.
FINE.
IT'S OK, I'VE BEEN FIGHTING ALL DAY.
I FIRED KIMMY FROM THE PAPER.
YOU FIRED YOUR BEST FRIEND?
EX-BEST FRIEND.
D.J., I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M ACTUALLY SAYING THIS, BUT DON'T YOU THINK YOU AND KIMMY OUGHT TO TRY WORK THIS OUT?
I AM.
I'M WORKING ON AN EDITORIAL THAT'S GONNA TRASH HER REPUTATION.
I'VE GOT SECRETS STORED UP SINCE KINDERGARTEN.
YEAH, BUT YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH SO MUCH TOGETHER.
YOU'RE A TEAM.
YOU'RE PARTNERS.
YEAH, TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR DAD AND BECKY.
THEY'D NEVER LET A LITTLE SQUABBLE COME BETWEEN THEM.
THEY'RE WAY TOO MATURE FOR THAT.
YEAH, DEEJ, NO MATTER WHAT YOUR DIFFERENCES ARE, YOU KNOW, YOU AND KIMMY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THERE FOR EACH OTHER, RIGHT?
'CAUSE YOU TWO CARE ABOUT EACH OTHER.
DEEJ, IT DOESN'T TAKE STRENGTH TO HOLD A GRUDGE.
IT TAKES STRENGTH TO LET GO OF ONE.
NOW, THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN A FRIENDSHIP IS FORGIVENESS.
I'M SORRY.
OH, I'M SORRY, TOO.
I'M SORRY.
YOU SEE THAT, DEEJ?
DOESN'T THAT MAKE YOU WANNA RUN NEXT DOOR AND GIVE KIMMY A BIG HUG?
NO, NOT REALLY.
THANKS FOR THE TALK.
I WONDER IF "CHEESE FOR BRAINS" IS HYPHENATED.
WELL, AT LEAST OUR SPEECH SAVED ONE FRIENDSHIP.
DANNY, IF MY PERKINESS EVER GETS ON YOUR NERVES, YOU JUST LET ME KNOW.
AND IF I EVER START TALKING TO MUCH OR RAMBLING, OR BABBLING, OR JUST RUNNING OFF THE MOUTH-- DANNY-- I'LL SHUT UP.
OK, BOYS, THIS IS THE LAST TIME YOU'LL SEE KIMMY GIBBLER IN THIS HOUSE.
I'M RETURNING ALL YOUR STUFF.
JESSE, HERE'S YOUR HAIRBRUSH.
HERE.
YOU CAN KEEP THE HAIR.
JOEY, HERE ARE YOUR CAR KEYS.
TIME FOR A NEW CAR STEREO.
TIME FOR A NEW CAR ALARM.
AND MR.
T, HERE IS YOUR ANSWERING MACHINE BEEPER.
BY THE WAY, CALL YOUR MOM.
THAT'S ALL I BORROWED FROM YOU GUYS.
ALL RIGHT, KIMMY, TO BORROW, YOU NEED CONSENT.
OTHERWISE, IT'S CALLED STEALING.
MR.
T, I'LL MISS YOUR DRY SENSE OF HUMOR MOST OF ALL.
"BY SECOND GRADE, "KIMMY'S DISEASED MIND REACHED A NEW LOW.
"SHE FAKED THE MUMPS WITH TWO HOSTESS SNOWBALLS STUFFED IN HER CHEEKS".
I DID IT.
I LOST HER GOING THROUGH THE DOGGIE DOOR.
OH, PLEASE, DON'T LET IT BE MICHELLE IT'S KIMMY GIBBLER.
OR KIMMY GIBBLER.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE, GIBBLER?
BRINGING BACK ALL YOUR STUFF, TANNER.
STUFF?
TELL KIMMY TO LEAVE MY STUFF AND GO.
D.J. SAYS GET YOU AND YOUR CHICKEN LEGS OUT OF HERE.
TELL YOUR SISTER I WANT ALL OF MY STUFF BACK, TOO.
KIMMY SAYS SHE WANTS HER STUFF BACK SO SHE CAN LEAVE AND NEVER EVER COME BACK HERE AGAIN.
EVER.
I'LL BE HAPPY TO GIVE IT TO HER.
FINE.
HERE'S THE BANANARAMA TAPE YOU GOT ME FOR MY BIRTHDAY.
SHOWS WHAT YOU KNOW.
I GAVE YOU BANANARAMA FOR CHRISTMAS.
FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY, I BOUGHT YOU THE BANGLES.
BANGLES, BANANARAMA, WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?
WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS, YOU TWO ARE HISTORY.
HERE'S YOUR FANNY PACK.
HERE ARE YOUR LEG WARMERS.
YOUR PINEAPPLE LIP GLOSS.
YOUR ERIK ESTRADA CHIPS ACTION FIGURE.
YOUR OLD RETAINER.
YOUR SHRUNKEN HEAD.
YOU GUYS HAD A WEIRD RELATIONSHIP.
THIS IS NOT MY SHRUNKEN HEAD.
YES, IT IS.
YOU GAVE IT TO ME IN THIRD GRADE AT THE CARNIVAL.
OH, RIGHT.
WE RODE ON THE SCREAMING SIREN, AND YOU GOT SICK.
YOU GAVE HIM TO ME TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.
YEAH, AN THEN YOU SAID IT LOOKED LIKE OUR TEACHER MRS.
HUNT.
ACTUALLY, MRS.
HUNT'S HEAD WAS SMALLER.
GIRLS, WHY ARE WE LAUGHING?
WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE FIGHTING.
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT TOGETHER, HUH?
NO YEAH.
IT WOULD BE A SHAME TO GIVE ALL THIS GOOD STUFF BACK.
NO.
I'M SORRY, KIMMY.
I'M SORRY, TOO, D.J. NO I'M SORRY ABOUT THE GIBBLER GAZETTE.
I'LL TEAR THEM ALL UP.
I HATED WHAT YOU WROTE ABOUT ME, BUT LOVED THE WAY YOU WROTE IT.
YOU'VE GOT REAL STYLE THERE.
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE OUR NEW GOSSIP COLUMNIST?
REALLY?
YOU WANT ME TO POKE MY NOSE INTO OTHER PEOPLE'S BUSINESS AND SPREAD WILD RUMORS AROUND SCHOOL?
YOU DO IT ANYWAY.
YOU MIGHT AS WELL WRITE IT DOWN.
THIS IS GREAT!
WE CAN SPEND EVEN MORE TIME TOGETHER.
STOP.
YOU'RE KILLING ME.
STOP.
YOU'RE KILLING ME.
HEY, KIMMY, WANNA PLAY SHADOW?
HEY, KIMMY, DO YOU WANNA PLAY SHADOW?
NO, I HATE THAT GAME.
NO, I HATE THAT GAME.
I SAID NO.
I SAID NO.
I REALLY MEAN IT.
I REALLY MEAN IT.
STOP IT!
STOP IT!
STOP IT!
STOP IT!
I'M GETTING ANNOYED.
I'M GETTING ANNOYED.
MICHELLE MICHELLE I'M NOT JOKING.
I'M NOT JOKING.
ENOUGH!
ENOUGH!

SEE YOU, GUYS.
AW, JESS, WHY DID I EAT THIS CANDY APPLE FOR BREAKFAST?
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE TO WASH DOWN THE CORN DOG?
NO.
'CAUSE IT WAS CALLING ME.
"PSST.
HEY, JOEY".
"COME HERE.
"LOOK, I'M JUICY, AND I'M GOOEY, AND I'M ON A STICK".
THAT'S THE SAME THING THE CORN DOG SAID.
ANYHOW, THAT STICKY GOOP PULLED OUT ONE OF MY FILLINGS.
THAT MUST KILL.
ONLY WHEN I GO LIKE THIS-- OW!
DON'T GO LIKE THAT.
ANYWAY, THE DENTIST CAN SEE ME THIS MORNING.
YOU GOTTA COVER FOR ME, IT'S MY DAY TO BE PARENT VOLUNTEER AT MICHELLE'S PRESCHOOL.
OH, NO NO NO.
I'M NOT GONNA WASTE MY ONE FREE MORNING WITH A BUNCH OF WHINEY, STICKY-FINGERED, RUNNY-NOSED ANKLE-BITERS.
JESS, YOU LEAVE ME NO CHOICE.
MICHELLE!
I'M READY, JOEY.
LISTEN, WHATEVER YOU BOZOS HAVE COOKED UP, IT AIN'T GONNA WORK.
UH, MICHELLE, HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF YOUR UNCLE JESSE WENT TO PRESCHOOL WITH YOU?
I'D BE THE HAPPIEST GIRL IN THE WHOLE WORLD.
JOSEPH, I'VE LIVED WITH THIS KID FOR FOUR YEARS.
I'M CUTE-PROOF.
WELL, THEN YOU WON'T MIND MY ASKING-- MICHELLE, HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF YOUR UNCLE JESSE DIDN'T GO WITH YOU?
I'D BE THE SADDEST GIRL IN THE WHOLE WORLD.
MICHELLE, ARE YOU JUST SAYING THAT 'CAUSE JOEY TOLD YOU TO?
AND BECAUSE I LOVE YOU.
OH, BEAUTIFUL SAVE.
ALL RIGHT, CALL HER OFF.
I'LL GO TO PRESCHOOL WITH YOU.
THANK YOU.
THAT WAS EASY.
HERE YOU GO, STEPH, HOT OFF THE PRESS.
YOUR FREE COPY OF OUR SCHOOL NEWSPAPER.
GEE, THANKS.
NEWS ABOUT KIDS I DON'T KNOW AT A SCHOOL I DON'T GO TO.
CHECK OUT MY NEW COLUMN-- MADAME KIMMY'S HOROSCOPE.
OH.
IF THE WORDS ARE TOO BIG FOR YOU TO READ, YOU CAN ALWAYS COLOR ON IT.
HOROSCOPE?
WHAT'S THAT, KIMMY, A TELESCOPE THAT CAN ONLY SEE YOUR FACE?
WELL, AS EDITOR OF THE SCHOOL PAPER, I MUST SAY KIMMY DID AN EXCELLENT JOB.
SHE GOT ALL THE ASTROLOGICAL SIGNS RIGHT, EXCEPT FOR AQUARIUM, THE FISH TANK.
ARE YOU SAYING KIMMY CAN TELL THE FUTURE?
SHE CAN BARELY TELL TIME.
D.J., READ STEPHANIE'S HOROSCOPE.
I BET YOU ALL OF MADAME KIMMY'S PREDICTIONS COME TRUE.
LET'S SEE WHAT THE STARS FORETELL, YOUNG CAPRICORN.
"YOUR DAY STARTS WITH GOOD FORTUNE".
WRONG ALREADY.
KIMMY'S HERE.
"AFTERNOON BRINGS UNPLEASANT SURPRISE".
WHAT HAPPENS, KIMMY COMES BACK?
"THEN A MISUNDERSTANDING WILL OCCUR AT HOME.
EXERCISE EXTREME CAUTION AFTER DARK".
GO NOW.
I MUST REST.
YOUR DAY STARTS WITH GOOD FORTUNE.
MAYBE YOU SHOULD CHECK YOUR POCKET.
WOW.
A DOLLAR.
JUST LIKE MY HOROSCOPE SAID.
UH-OH.
DOES THIS MEAN ALL THAT BAD STUFF'S GONNA HAPPEN, TOO?
CHILL, SQUIRT.
I PUT THAT DOLLAR IN YOUR POCKET.
NOW THE JOKE'S OVER.
GIVE IT BACK.
NOT SO FAST.
KIMMY, YOUR HOROSCOPE SAYS-- "YOU'LL MAKE A FINANCIAL BLUNDER".
YOUR BLUNDER, MY BUCK.
LET'S SEE WHAT MINE SAYS.
"YOU WILL TALK WITH A BAD ACCENT".
LET'S GO.
WE'RE MISSING ALL THE FUN.
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
MICHELLE, YOU GOTTA KNOW I'M NOT REALLY INTO THIS PRESCHOOL GIG SO DON'T MAKE A BIG DEAL THAT I'M HERE, OK?
YOU GOT IT, DUDE.
HEY, EVERYBODY, THIS IS MY UNCLE JESSE.
HI, UNCLE JESSE!
HI, UNCLE JESSE!
HI, RUG RATS.
I'M MRS.
MANNING.
WELCOME TO PRESCHOOL, UNCLE JESSE.
NICE TO MEET YOU.
LISTEN, I'LL JUST, UH, STAY OUT OF YOUR WAY.
WAKE ME UP FOR NAP TIME.
UNCLE JESSE, YOU'RE OUR SPECIAL HELPER TODAY.
AND SPECIAL HELPERS GET TO JOIN IN ALL THE FUN.
UH-- NO.
I'M NOT REALLY THAT EXPERIENCED IN THE SPECIAL HELPER FIELD.
I'M REALLY A MUSICIAN BY TRADE.
THAT'S PERFECT, BECAUSE TODAY IS MUSIC DAY.
PERFECT.
OK, EVERYBODY.
GATHER AROUND THE MAGIC CARPET.
PICK UP YOUR INSTRUMENTS.
UNCLE JESSE, YOU GET TO SIT IN THE MAGIC CHAIR.
IT'LL BE MAGIC IF I CAN FIT INTO THIS THING.
HA HA HA!
HA HA HA HA!
HA HA HA HA.
I'M SITTING IN A MAGIC CHAIR ON A MAGIC CARPET WITH THE MUNCHKIN TABERNACLE CHOIR.
I FEEL LIKE A DOOFUS.
LET'S PLAY MUSIC, UNCLE DOOFUS.
HEH HEH HEH HEH.
VERY, VERY CUTE.
NEVER SAY THAT AGAIN.
UNCLE JESSE CAN SING LIKE ELVIS.
WONDERFUL.
WHY DON'T YOU PLAY THE CHILDREN A SONG?
I DON'T THINK THE KING PLAYED A LOT OF PRESCHOOLS.
HE'S CHICKEN!
OH, YEAH.
LIKE I'M REALLY GONNA RESPOND TO THE CHALLENGE OF A 4-YEAR-OLD.
BAWK BAWK BAWK.
BAWK BAWK BAWK!
GIVE ME THAT GUITAR.
UNCLE JESSE, AARON TOOK MY TAMBOURINE.
HEY, BE COOL, MAN.
THERE'S NO STEALING ON THE MAGIC CARPET.
KEEP THAT UP AND YOU'RE GONNA END UP IN MAGIC PRISON.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.
WE'RE GONNA DO A LITTLE TUNE NOW.
ABOUT A CAT WE ALL KNOW AND LOVE AND HE GOES BY THE NAME OF FARMER, OK?
AND GUESS WHERE HE LIVES?
YOU GUYS KNOW WHERE HE LIVES?
WELL YOU DON'T.
IN THE DELL.
THAT'S WHERE HE LIVES.
THE FABULOUS, CRAZY, WACKY DELL.
THAT'S WHERE THE CAT LIVES.
LET'S DO IT A LITTLE LIKE THIS.
* THE FARMER IN THE DELL * * THE FARMER IN THE DELL * * VIVA LAS DAIRY-O * * THE FARMER IN THE DELL * * THE CHEESE STANDS ALONE * * THE CHEESE STANDS ALONE * * A HUNK-A HUNK-A STINKY CHEESE * * THE CHEESE STANDS ALONE ** YAY!

UNCLE JESSE, WHILE I GET READY FOR PUPPET TIME, WHY DON'T YOU HAND OUT THESE ANIMAL COOKIES.
SOUNDS EASY ENOUGH.
ALL RIGHT, WHO WANTS A COOKIE?
ME!
ME!
ME!
WHOA!
WATCH THE HAIR!
ALL RIGHT.
WHO WAS FIRST?
ME!
ME!
ME!
STUPID QUESTION.
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
HERE YOU GO.
YOU GET AN ELEPHANT.
YOU GET A CAMEL.
YOU GET SOMETHING WITH ITS HEAD MISSING.
COME ON.
FOLLOW ME, FOLLOW ME.
WHAT HAPPENED TO MY LIFE?
HEY, YOU ATE MY ELEPHANT.
IT'S IN MY TUMMY NOW.
HA HA HA.
UNCLE JESSE, AARON ATE MY ELEPHANT.
THAT'S NOT FAIR.
GO EAT HIS COOKIE.
IF SOMEBODY DOES SOMETHING TO YOU, DO IT BACK TO THEM.
WORKS FOR ME.
HERE YOU GO.
CLEAN HANDS.
NO, THE CLEAN HAND.
GIVE ME YOUR COOKIE.
THAT WAS MY CAMEL.
IT'S IN MY TUMMY NOW.
HA HA HA.
OW!
OWW!
OW!
OW-OWW!
OW!
OW!
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?
MICHELLE PINCHED ME.
MICHELLE, DID YOU PINCH AARON?
YES, I DID.
WAIT A MINUTE.
MICHELLE, DID AARON PINCH YOU FIRST?
YES, HE DID.
YOU BOTH KNOW THAT PINCHING IS NOT ALLOWED.
UNCLE JESSE SAID TO DO IT BACK.
THE KID'S BEEN BUGGING HER ALL MORNING.
AND HE CALLED ME UNCLE DOOFUS.
WELL, THAT'S NOT HOW WE SETTLE THINGS HERE.
I THINK BOTH OF YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO SIT IN THE CORNER FOR TIME OUT.
NOW, AARON, OVER THERE.
MICHELLE, OVER THERE.
ME?
I'M THE GOOD ONE.
YEAH, SHE'S THE GOOD ONE.
MICHELLE, GO.
YOU CALL THIS JUSTICE HERE?
THE KID WAS JUST TRYING TO DEFEND HERSELF.
IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR FOR MY CLASSROOM.
HEY TEACH, I THINK YOU'VE BEEN SPENDING A LITTLE TOO MUCH TIME ON THE OLD MAGIC CARPET.
THERE'S A REAL WORLD OUT THERE AND THESE KIDS HAVE TO LEARN TO STICK UP FOR THEMSELVES.
THEY ALSO HAVE TO LEARN THAT VIOLENCE IS NOT THE ANSWER.
OH, SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT ANYBODY CAN JUST COME UP AND EAT HER ELEPHANT?
I WANT MY NIECE TO LEARN TO STAND UP FOR HERSELF.
THE PUNISHMENT STANDS.
I'M SORRY.
I'M IN CHARGE AT THIS SCHOOL.
OH, YEAH?
MAYBE MICHELLE SHOULDN'T BE AT THIS SCHOOL.
COME ON, MICHELLE.
WE'RE OUT OF HERE.
KIDS, SAY GOODBYE TO MICHELLE.
BYE.
BYE.
MM.
IT'S GREAT.
HI.
OH, GREAT, JOEY, YOU'RE BACK FROM THE DENTIST.
YOU HAVE GOT TO TRY THIS TED KOPPEL CAPELLINI.
I CAN'T.
I HAD NOVOCAIN.
THEN THEY WENT--ZZZZ!
AND THEN I HAD A ROOT CANAL.
WHAT DID HE SAY?
YOU HEARD HIM.
HE SAID HE HAD ROOT-RRARAWRL.
THANKS FOR CLEARING THAT UP.
I'LL GET THAT.
HELLO?
OH, HI, RRA-RA.
HU-UUH?
HA HA.
UH-HUH.
ERR RORR HURR EE.
ERR-RAH.
UH-HUH.
HA HA HA HA!
HI.
HI.
HI.
HI, MICHELLE.
WHERE'D YOU GET ALL THIS STUFF?
AT THE ZOO.
I SAW LIONS AND TIGERS AND BEARS.
OH, MY.
WHAT HAPPENED TO PRESCHOOL?
I QUIT PRESCHOOL.
YOU QUIT PRESCHOOL?
WELL, SHE DIDN'T ACTUALLY QUIT, I KINDA PULLED HER OUT OF THERE.
DANNY, THIS PRESCHOOL THING IS WAY OVERRATED.
MICHELLE, TELL YOUR DADDY WHAT YOU LEARNED TODAY IN THE REAL WORLD.
A CAMEL CAN SPIT.
ONE DAY YOU'RE GONNA BE GLAD I PULLED HER OUT OF THAT PLACE.
HOW COULD YOU DO THIS?
IT HAPPENS TO BE AN EXCELLENT PRESCHOOL.
MICHELLE WAS GETTING AN ACADEMIC FOUNDATION THAT'S GONNA CARRY HER THROUGH GRADES K-12, TROUGH COLLEGE, THROUGH HARVARD LAW SCHOOL.
JESS, YOU HAVE ROBBED OUR NATION OF ONE OF THE FINEST LEGAL MINDS A SUPREME COURT HAS EVER KNOWN.
I GOTTA GO POTTY.
DANNY, I KNOW THAT YOU'RE UPSET, BUT I'M SURE THAT JESSE HAD A VERY GOOD REASON FOR PULLING HER OUT OF PRESCHOOL.
YEAH, I'M SURE.
HE'S OUT OF HIS MIND.
TELL HIM, HONEY.
THEY WERE GONNA MAKE MICHELLE SIT IN A CORNER.
AND THEN THAT'S IT.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
HE'S OUT OF HIS MIND.
YOU GUYS WEREN'T THERE.
I MEAN, THIS LITTLE KID WAS BUGGING HER ALL MORNING.
I TOLD HER TO STICK UP FOR HERSELF AND A KID PINCHED HER SO SHE PINCHED HIM BACK-- A REAL GOOD ONE, TOO.
OH, THAT'S A GREAT LESSON.
OH, WORKED FOR ME AS A KID.
AN EYE FOR AN EYE.
A PINCH FOR A PINCH.
IT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN SURVIVE OUT THERE ON THOSE STREETS.
WHAT STREETS?
MICHELLE'S NOT EVEN ALLOWED OUT OF THE BACK YARD.
OK, I JUST WANTED THE KID TO LEARN TO STAND UP FOR HERSELF, OKAY?
WELL SO DO I, BUT THAT'S NO REASON TO PULL HER OUT OF SCHOOL WITHOUT CONSULTING ME FIRST.
I THOUGHT I WAS LIVING HERE TO HELP MY NIECES.
WELL THOSE NIECES JUST HAPPEN TO BE MY DAUGHTERS.
OH, SO WHAT AM I, JUST HIRED HELP OR SOMETHING?
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'LL GO COOK DINNER.
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE?
CHICKEN OR PORK CHOPS?
I'D HATE TO MAKE SUCH A BIG DECISION WITHOUT CONSULTING THE KING FIRST.
JESS, JUST COOK WHATEVER YOU WANT.
I DO KINDA FEEL LIKE CHICKEN, THOUGH.
OH OH, NO.
IT'S CHILDPROOF.
JOEY, I'M FREAKING OUT.
KIMMY'S HOROSCOPE SAID I HAVE AN UNPLEASANT SURPRISE.
AND IT HAPPENED.
INSTEAD OF PIZZA, THE CAFETERIA SERVED PIMENTO LOAF.
IT WAS LIKE EATING BOLOGNA WITH EYES.
JOEY, I CAN'T UNDERSTAND YOU.
HEY, WAIT A SECOND.
"A MISUNDERSTANDING WILL OCCUR AT HOME".
I'M AT HOME.
I'M MISUNDERSTANDING YOU.
I'M FREAKING OUT AGAIN.
KIMMY, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS FOR NEXT WEEK'S EDITORIAL.
"TARDINESS-- ARE WE REALLY LATE OR DOES CLASS START JUST A BIT TOO EARLY"?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, PRACTICING FOR THE NERD OLYMPICS?
KIMMY, EVERYTHING IN YOUR HOROSCOPE CAME TRUE.
NOW IT SAYS TO EXERCISE EXTREME CAUTION AFTER DARK.
THAT'S WHY I'M SLEEPING WITH MICHELLE'S NIGHT LIGHT.
WELL, I GUESS I BETTER TELL YOU THE TRUTH, KID.
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ASTROLOGY.
I JUST COPY THOSE HOROSCOPES OUT OF OLD NEWSPAPERS.
YOU MEAN, THANKS TO THIS WOMAN, I SPENT MY WHOLE DAY FREAKING OUT OVER NOTHING?
HOW RUDE!
HEY, YOU STOLE MY CLOWN LIGHT.
MICHELLE, I JUST NEEDED TO BORROW IT.
THAT'S MINE.
YOU'RE IN BIG TROUBLE, MISTER.
OW!
WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE?
DID YOU SEE WHAT MICHELLE JUST DID?
NO.
MICHELLE, WHAT DID YOU JUST DO?
I DID THIS.
OW!
MICHELLE, STOP PINCHING STEPHANIE.
YOU SAID I COULD.
NO.
NO.
IT WAS DIFFERENT.
I SAID YOU COULD BEFORE BECAUSE AARON TOOK YOUR COOKIE.
STEPHANIE TOOK MY LAMP.
YEAH, BUT IN ONE CASE SOMEBODY TOOK SOMETHING THAT WAS YOURS.
BUT IN THE OTHER CASE, SOMEBODY TOOK SOMETHING THAT WAS YOURS.
OH, BOY.
GIVE IT BACK OR YOU'RE GETTING IT AGAIN.
WHOA, CRAB GIRL.
PUT AWAY THOSE PINCHERS.
COME ON.
FOLLOW ME.
WE'RE GOING TO MY ROOM.
I'LL BE BACK FOR THE CLOWN.
ALL RIGHT, MICHELLE, I'M GONNA HAVE TO HAVE ONE OF OUR WORLD FAMOUS TALKS.
NOW I'M NOT VERY HAPPY ABOUT IT, BUT YOUR UNCLE JESSE WAS WRONG TODAY.
I KNOW.
I'M AS SHOCKED AS YOU ARE, BUT I LOST MY COOL TODAY AND I ACTED LIKE A BIG JERK.
NO PROBLEM.
WELL, IT IS A PROBLEM.
SEE, MICHELLE, WHEN I WAS A KID, I USED TO GET IN A LOT OF FIGHTS AND LOOKING BACK, I REALIZE THAT I HANDLED THOSE FIGHTS ALL WRONG.
SHOULD'VE LED WITH MY JAB.
NO, JUST KIDDING.
I'M NOT PROUD OF THOSE FIGHTS.
NO PROBLEM.
WELL, WHAT I SHOULD'VE SAID TODAY WAS THAT IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM, YOU SHOULD TRY TO SOLVE IT WITH WORDS, LIKE "KNOCK IT OFF" OR THE EVER POPULAR "BUZZ OFF, BUCKO".
AND IF THAT DOESN'T WORK, YOU SHOULD TRY TO FIND A PARENT OR TEACHER TO HELP YOU.
BUT ABSOLUTELY NO HITTING OR PINCHING.
CAPEESH?
CAPEESH.
NO MORE PINCHING.
JESS, I CALLED MRS.
MANNING AND I STRAIGHTENED EVERYTHING OUT.
MICHELLE, YOU'RE GOING BACK TO SCHOOL TOMORROW.
OK, BUT IT'S SATURDAY.
MAKE THAT MONDAY, THEN.
DANNY, I STRAIGHTENED A FEW THINGS OUT WITH MICHELLE.
MICHELLE, TELL YOUR DADDY WHAT YOU LEARNED TODAY.
UNCLE JESSE IS A BIG JERK.
YOU TAUGHT HER THAT?
NO I DIDN'T TEACH HER THAT.
WELL, ACTUALLY, YEAH, I DID TEACH HER THAT.
BUT I TAUGHT HER NO PINCHING.
THAT'S WHAT I TAUGHT HER.
DANNY, I'M SORRY.
I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY.
I SHOULD'VE TALKED TO YOU ABOUT ALL THIS STUFF BEFORE I TURNED MICHELLE INTO A PRESCHOOL DROPOUT.
THAT'S OK, JESS.
I KNOW YOU WERE JUST TRYING TO PROTECT HER.
I JUST WISH THERE WAS SOME WAY I COULD MAKE IT UP TO YOU.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THERE IS.
YOU ARE A VERY LUCKY MAN.
BECAUSE I TOLD THE SCHOOL YOU WERE GONNA BE THE SPECIAL HELPER ALL NEXT WEEK.
ISN'T THAT GOOD NEWS, MICHELLE?
THAT MAKES ME VERY HAPPY.
COME HERE, HONEY.
OH, BOY.
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE FUN IN PRESCHOOL NEXT WEEK.
YOU'RE GONNA PLAY GUITAR FOR THE KIDS, YOU KNOW, DO A LOT OF ELVIS SONGS, THEN YOU CAN SIT IN ONE OF THOSE LITTLE CHAIRS.
OH, THAT'S GREAT.

JOEY, THIS IS THE BIG TIME, MAN.
YOU BETTER CALL YOUR MOM.
WELL, I'M SURE MY MOM WOULD LOVE TO COME AND SEE ME BUT SHE CAN'T.

THE BAND KICKED IN.
HE DID THE KNEEL THING.

I JUST SAID IT.
DON'T BE CRUEL.
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.
I'M COMING, I'M COMING.
IT'S A BIG ROOM.
JOEY GLADSTONE FAN CLUB.
HEY!
COME ON IN, GUYS.
WHOA!
OOH!
WOW, VERY IMPRESSIVE-- BIG WET BAR, CLASSY VEGAS FURNITURE NICE BIG BOWL OF BANANAS.
THOSE WERE FOR THE CHIMPS.
HOW'S THE CROWD OUT THERE?
THE PLACE IS PACKED.
THEY WERE CHANTING, "WE WANT WAYNE!
WE WANT WAYNE"!
"RIGHT AFTER JOEY!
' "RIGHT AFTER JOEY"!
HEY, LISTEN, GUYS.
IT'S ALMOST SHOW TIME, AND I'M SWEATING LIKE AN AARDVARK IN A SAUNA.
I'M GONNA GO BLOW-DRY MY SHIRT.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
D.J., SHOULD WE SAVE AN EXTRA SEAT AT THE TABLE FOR JOEY'S DAD?
JOEY'S DAD?
WELL, IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A SURPRISE.
WE LEFT A MESSAGE FOR JOEY'S DAD INVITING HIM TO THE SHOW.
GIRLS, YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE CALLED COLONEL GLADSTONE WITHOUT MY PERMISSION.
JOEY AND HIS DAD ARE LIKE OIL AND VINEGAR.
NO, THAT WOULD BE SALAD DRESSING.
THEY'RE MORE LIKE OIL AND MAYONNAISE.
ACTUALLY, THERE'S OIL IN MAYONNAISE.
LET ME SAVE US AN HOUR.
JOEY AND HIS DAD DON'T GET ALONG.
I'M COOL, I'M DRY AND MY CHEST HAIR'S NEVER BEEN FLUFFIER.
I GOT IT.
THIS IS MY FAVORITE PART, YOU GUYS.
THIS IS WHERE THE STAGE MANAGER COMES IN AND SAYS, "TWO MINUTES TILL SHOW TIME, MR.
GLADSTONE".
HELLO, JOSEPH.
DAD.
DAD, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I GOT A MESSAGE YOU REALLY REALLY REALLY WANTED ME HERE.
YOU DID?
I THOUGHT IT WAS RATHER CUTE, HAVING YOUR PERSONAL SECRETARIES CALL.
NOW, THERE WAS A MISS JANET ABDUL.
WELL, OUTSIDE OF THE OFFICE THEY CALL ME D.J. AND THERE WAS BARBIE DOLLANBEAR.
JOSEPH, I'M GETTING THE FEELING YOU HAD NO IDEA I WAS COMING.
WELL, DAD, UH IT WAS MY IDEA.
I'M SORRY.
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A FUN SURPRISE.
WELL, YOU FUN-SURPRISED ME.
UH, DAD, YOU REMEMBER DANNY, DON'T YOU?
RIGHT.
THE SKINNY KID WITH THE CLEAN SHOES.
YOU WERE MY INSPIRATION, SIR-- SPIT AND POLISH.
ALTHOUGH HERE'S A HELPFUL HINT, WITH A LITTLE MORE POLISH YOU CAN AVOID THE ICKY SPIT.
THANKS, DANNY.
THIS IS MY FRIEND AND BUSINESS PARTNER JESSE KATSOPOLIS.
NICE TO MEET YOU, SON.
PUT ON A TIE.
NICE TO MEET YOU, SIR.
NO.
WELL, GIRLS, WHY DON'T WE LET LET JOEY AND HIS DAD GET REACQUAINTED?
LET'S GET TO OUR TABLE BEFORE WE MISS JOEY'S SHOW.
BUT JOEY'S RIGHT HERE.
GOOD POINT.
I'LL THINK OF A BETTER EXCUSE ON THE WAY.
DAD, THIS IS SO GREAT.
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE HERE.
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M HERE, EITHER.
ESPECIALLY SINCE YOU DIDN'T INVITE ME.
WELL YOU CAN'T BLAME ME FOR THINKING YOU WOULDN'T COME.
I MEAN, I'VE BEEN DOING STANDUP FOR 11 YEARS AND YOU'VE NEVER SEEN ME WORK.
YOU CALL TELLING JOKES WORK?
JOSEPH, YOU WERE A SMART YOUNG MAN.
YOU COULD'VE GONE TO WEST POINT.
DONE SOMETHING IMPORTANT WITH YOUR LIFE.
WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS WHAT I'M DOING RIGHT NOW, DAD.
I'M MAKING PEOPLE LAUGH.
I'M RUNNING MY OWN PRODUCTION COMPANY.
I'M HELPING DANNY RAISE HIS THREE KIDS, AND LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, I WILL NEVER MISS ONE THEIR DANCE RECITALS, AND I'LL NEVER MISS ONE OF THEIR SOCCER GAMES.
THAT KIND OF STUFF NEVER MATTERED TO YOU.
ARE YOU FINISHED?
NO.
DAD, YOU MISSED MY WINNING GOAL AT THE JUNIOR HOCKEY TOURNAMENT.
YOU NEVER SAW ME PLAY THE ELF IN MY THIRD GRADE CHRISTMAS PLAY.
AND IT'S TOO BAD, 'CAUSE I MADE A ONE HECK OF AN ELF.
I WAS THE DeNIRO OF ELVES, DAD.
ARE YOU FINISHED NOW?
YEAH.
I GOTTA ADMIT IT FELT GOOD TO GET THAT OFF MY CHEST.
I'M GLAD YOUR LITTLE OUTBURST MADE YOU FEEL BETTER.
GOODBYE, JOSEPH.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, JOEY GLADSTONE.
WHOA!
WELL, BLOW ME DOWN.
THANK YOU.
OH, COME ON, NOW.
OH, COME ON, NOW.
CUT IT OUT.
QUIT IT.
COME ON.
WELL, QUIT IT.
COME ON, NOW.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
THIS IS MY FIRST TIME PLAYING LAS VEGAS.
BOY, WHAT A TOWN.
IN THE SAME NIGHT YOU CAN GET MARRIED, DIVORCED, LOSE YOUR ENTIRE LIFE SAVINGS, AND STILL GO HOME HAPPY BECAUSE HEY YOU HAD THAT 19 CENT SHRIMP COCKTAIL, YOU KNOW?
THANK YOU.
OH, COME ON.
CUT IT OUT.
QUIT IT.
SO, LET'S SEE, WHY AM I HERE?
UH..
OH, COMEDY.
SORRY, I KINDA LOST MY TRAIN OF THOUGHT.
I JUST HAD A LONG TALK WITH MY DAD BACKSTAGE.
DON'T GET A CHANCE TO SEE MY DAD TOO MUCH THESE DAYS.
HE WAS A MILITARY MAN.
IT'S STRANGE GROWING UP WHEN YOUR FATHER IS A PERSON IN THE MILITARY, YOU KNOW?
I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS ME OFF TO BOOTY CAMP.
THAT WAS KIND OF FUN.
YEAH, I LEARNED TO CRAWL UNDER A BARBED WIRE.
YEAH, THAT WAS KIND OF WEIRD.
HAD THAT LITTLE CAMOUFLAGED DIAPER.
THAT WAS KIND OF CUTE.
YEAH, I REMEMBER HE TOOK US ON OUR FIRST FAMILY VACATION.
IT WAS A CROSS-COUNTRY TRIP AND IT WAS A TOUGH MARCH WITH THAT I REMEMBER EVERYBODY IN OUR FAMILY HAD TO GET BRUSH-CUTS, EVEN GRANDMA.
YEAH.
THAT WAS..
BOY, POOR GRAM SHE HATED PLAYING BINGO WITH THAT HALF-INCH OF BLUE HAIR, YOU KNOW?
OH, COME ON, NOW.
CUT THAT OUT.
QUIT IT.
SO, I'M A SINGLE GUY, WHICH IS GREAT, BUT  THANK YOU.
OH, COME ON.
WHICH IS GREAT, BEING A SINGLE GUY, BUT THE ONLY PROBLEM IS YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH OTHER SINGLE GUYS, ESPECIALLY COOL GUYS, YOU KNOW THE KIND OF GUYS I'M TALKING ABOUT.
GUYS WHO ACTUALLY WOBBLE THEIR HEAD 'CAUSE THEY THINK IT LOOKS COOL.
YOU KNOW THESE GUYS, IF YOU'RE IN A BAR, AT A PARTY, ANY KIND OF MIXED SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT, THESE ARE THE GUYS WALKING AROUND LIKE THIS.
YOU KNOW, WHENEVER THEY RECOGNIZE SOMEBODY, THEY ALWAYS DO THAT PHONY GUN-POINT THING.
IT'S LIKE HEY.
HOW'S IT GOING?
WHAT'S THAT?
I'M SLIME?
HA HA HA HA!
I DON'T, UH I DON'T THINK YOU REALIZE I'M WOBBLING MY HEAD RIGHT NOW.
SOME GUYS YOU KNOW THEY THINK THEY'RE COOL.
THEY DON'T SEEM TO HAVE THAT HEAD COORDINATION DOWN PROPERLY.
THEY'RE GOING UP TO WOMEN LIKE, "HEY, HOW'S IT GOING"?
I WAS IN A BAR ONCE, THIS GUY'S HEAD FLEW RIGHT OFF.
I WENT, "THAT IS THE COOLEST GUY I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE".
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, LAS VEGAS.
REMEMBER, IF YOU SEE ME WALKING THROUGH THE CASINO, I TAKE TIPS.

AH, WHAT A NIGHT.
I FINALLY PLAYED VEGAS, I WAS A BIG HIT, AND I ACTUALLY SANG ON STAGE WITH WAYNE NEWTON.
IT WAS QUITE A NIGHT.
DAD, YOU'RE STILL HERE?
MAY I HAVE A WORD WITH MY SON?
YOU KNOW, WE SHOULD CELEBRATE.
AFTER ALL, THIS IS LAS VEGAS, THE MOST EXCITING CITY IN THE WORLD.
THERE'S GOTTA BE A MINIATURE GOLF COURSE OPEN SOMEWHERE.
GOTTA WORK ON THAT WINDMILL SHOT OF MINE.
YOU KNOW, I'M A LITTLE-- DAD, YOU SAW MY SHOW?
YES, I DID.
YOU HEARD ALL THOSE JOKES I MADE ABOUT YOU?
SOME OF THEM WERE ACTUALLY FUNNY.
YOU LAUGHED?
I WILL.
LATER.
RIGHT NOW, WE NEED TO TALK.
I THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID EARLIER.
EVEN THOUGH YOUR MOTHER AND I WERE DIVORCED, I SHOULD'VE BEEN AROUND MORE WHILE YOU WERE GROWING UP.
JOSEPH, IT WASN'T EASY BEING STATIONED IN SOME GODFORSAKEN PLACE, AND GETTING MONTHLY REPORTS THAT YOU WERE GOOFING OFF AND DEMONSTRATING A COMPLETE LACK OF DISCIPLINE.
WHEN I CAME HOME, I FELT YOU NEEDED STRUCTURE AND AUTHORITY, NOT A PAL.
I COULD'VE USED A PAL.
ME, TOO.
I THINK WE COULD'VE BEEN GREAT BUDDIES.
AFTER ALL, YOU DO HAVE MY SENSE OF HUMOR.
UH, NO DISRESPECT INTENDED, DAD, BUT YOU AREN'T EXACTLY MR.
FUNNYPANTS.
WELL, THAT'S NOT TRUE.
DON'T YOU REMEMBER WHEN YOU WERE THREE AND HAD CHICKEN POX?
WE WATCHED CARTOONS TOGETHER FOR TWO WEEKS.
YOU WATCHED CARTOONS?
WHO DO YOU THINK TAUGHT YOU HOW TO DO POPEYE?
WELL, BLOW ME DOWN!
I'M REALLY GLAD YOU CAME TONIGHT, DAD.
ME, TOO, SON.
I WAS PROUD OF YOU.
THANKS, DAD.
YOU KNOW, I I WISH WE COULD'VE HAD THIS NIGHT A LONG TIME AGO.
WELL, MAYBE WE CAN MAKE A FRESH START NOW.
I LOVE YOU, DAD.
I LOVE YOU, TOO, SON.
COME HERE.
YOU KNOW, DAD, THAT POPEYE LAUGH THAT YOU DID?
IT REALLY IT WASN'T GOOD.
UH, I MEAN, IT'S CLOSE.
YOU JUST NEED A LITTLE WORK, YOU KNOW, ON THE "HA KA KA KA"!
IN THE ADAM'S APPLE THERE.
HA KA KA KA!
YEAH.
THEN YOU JUST THROW IN A "WHOA"!
WHOA!
WHOA!
HA KA KA KA!
YEAH, THERE YOU GO.

HEY, DEEJ, LOOK WHAT I GOT IN SCHOOL TODAY.
A RECORDER.
ANY REQUESTS?
YES.
PLEASE DON'T PLAY.
ON TOP OF OLD SMOKEY?
YOU GOT IT.
OH, YEAH.
THAT'S NOT GOING TO DRIVE ME NUTS.
THIS HAPPENS TO BE MY HOMEWORK FOR MUSIC APPRECIATION.
WELL, WHEN IT HAPPENS TO BE MUSIC, I'LL APPRECIATE IT.
NOW, WILL YOU PLEASE PRACTICE SOMEWHERE ELSE?
I'M MAKING A COLLAGE FOR KIMMY'S BIRTHDAY CARD.
HOWDY, GIRLS.
KIMMY, YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE IN THIS ROOM.
I'VE BEEN TELLING HER THAT FOR YEARS.
HERE'S YOUR INVITATION TO MY SURPRISE BIRTHDAY PARTY.
YOU'RE THROWING YOURSELF A SURPRISE BIRTHDAY PARTY?
YEAH, AND THIS IS THE FACE I'M GONNA USE.
"YOU ARE CORDIALLY INVITED "TO ATTEND KIMMY'S FABULOUS 14th SURPRISE BIRTHDAY PARTY AT THE EXCELSIOR HOTEL"?
WHOA!
HOW DID YOU SWING THAT?
MY BROTHER GARTH IS A BELLHOP.
HE CAN SNEAK US INTO THE POOL AREA.
OH, BUT IF ANYONE ASKS YOU ARE HEATHER ZINK, FROM PHILADELPHIA, AND YOU'RE STAYING IN ROOM 1541.
YOU'RE HAVING A POOL PARTY IN NOVEMBER?
WHAT A DUMB IDEA.
NO, THEY HAVE AN INDOOR POOL.
TOMORROW WE CAN GO SHOPPING FOR NEW BATHING SUITS.
THIS PARTY'S GONNA BE SO RAD.
YEAH, RAD FOR YOU.
BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE PERFECT BODY.
ME?
THE PERFECT BODY?
WELL, I GUESS I CAN'T ARGUE WITH YOU THERE.
THERE IS NO WAY I'M WEARING A BATHING SUIT IN FRONT OF EVERYONE UNTIL I LOOK LIKE ONE OF THESE MODELS.
BUT, D.J., YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND.
YOU'VE GOTTA COME TO MY PARTY.
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL COME.
BUT THIS MEANS I'VE ONLY GOT TWO WEEKS TO GET SKINNY, STARTING RIGHT NOW.
SO NO MORE COOKIES.
HOW DO YOU STAY SO THIN?
WELL, I EXERCISE, LIKE WAIST BENDS, FOR EXAMPLE.
AND 1 AND 2 AND 3 AND 4.
AND THEN I WATCH WHAT I EAT.
THIS LOOKS GOOD.
HEY, IS ANYBODY HOME?
HI, DEEJ.
HI.
WOW, I GUESS YOUR DAD AND THE GUYS WILL LIKE THESE A LOT BETTER THAN MICHELLE'S FINGER-PAINTINGS.
LOOKING AT THESE MODELS IS GONNA HELP ME STAY OUT OF THE REFRIGERATOR.
WHY?
ARE YOU TRYING TO LOSE WEIGHT?
I'VE GOT TWO WEEKS TO LOOK LIKE YOU.
DO YOU MIND IF I SCOTCH TAPE YOU TO THE REFRIGERATOR?
DEEJ, IF YOU WANNA LOSE A COUPLE OF POUNDS, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS EAT SENSIBLY.
YOU COULD HAVE BROILED FISH, LEAN CHICKEN WITHOUT THE SKIN, FRESH FRUITS, DELICIOUS STEAMED VEGETABLES, A NICE WHOLE GRAIN PASTA WITH A LIGHT TOMATO SAUCE AND JUST A SPRINKLING OF PARMESAN CHEESE-- BECKY, I'M TRYING TO KEEP MY MIND OFF OF FOOD.
SORRY.
THE IMPORTANT THING IS JUST KEEPING JUNK FOOD OUT OF THE HOUSE.
CAKE'S HERE.
UH, JESS MAYBE WE SHOULD DO THAT LATER.
OH.
THAT'S OK, BECKY.
I DON'T NEED ANY CAKE.
I'LL JUST HAVE ONE OF THESE DELICIOUS WATER POPS I MADE.
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY!
IN THE KITCHEN!
I NEED SOME OPINIONS!
FREE CAKE!
FREE CAKE?
CAKE?
DID YOU SAY SOMETHING'S FREE?
I'M COMING, I'M COMING, I'M COMING!
I'M HERE.
ALL RIGHT, WE NEED YOU GUYS TO HELP ME AND BECKY PICK OUT A WEDDING CAKE.
I THOUGHT WE DECIDED ON A CHOCOLATE CAKE.
WELL, WE DID, BUT CHOCOLATE'S NOT JUST CHOCOLATE ANYMORE.
SEE WHAT I MEAN?
WHOA, BABY!
YOU SEE, YOU GOT YOUR DARK CHOCOLATE, YOUR WHITE CHOCOLATE, YOUR CHUNKY CHOCOLATE, YOUR MOCHO CHOCO-CHOCOLATE, YOUR DOUBLE FUDGE CHOCOLATE, YOUR TRIPLE CHOCOLATE CHOCOLATE CHOCOLATE AND CARROT CAKE.
WELL, THE CARROT CAKE WAS SITTING THERE SO LONELY.
NO ONE PICKS CARROT CAKE.
LET'S PIG OUT.
NOW, NOW, MICHELLE, YOU'RE NOT BEING VERY POLITE.
I'M SORRY.
LET'S PIG OUT, PLEASE.
COME ON, DEEJ.
YOU'RE GONNA MISS THE CAKE.
OH, WHO NEEDS CAKE WHEN YOU CAN LICK ICE ON A STICK?
MMM.
WET AND COLD, AND THAT'S ABOUT IT.
I CAN'T TAKE IT.
I NEED THAT CAKE.
WHOA, MICHELLE.
MICHE-- ALL RIGHT.
MICHELLE.
MICHELLE.
WHICH ONE DO YOU LIKE BEST?
CHOCOLATE.
LET'S GO GIVE HER A BATH.
YEAH.
WEIGH-IN TIME.
I HATE THIS PART.
YOU NEED SOME WEIGHING MUSIC.
STEPH, HAVE MERCY ON MY EARS, WILL YOU?
THIS CAN'T BE RIGHT.
TWO DAYS, AND I'VE LOST 1/2 A POUND?
I'M GOING OFF THIS STUPID DIET.
GOOD.
YOU DON'T NEED TO BE ON A DIET, ANYWAY.
YOU WANNA SHAPE UP A LITTLE BIT, JUST EXERCISE.
I WANT YOU TO WORK OUT AT MICHELLE'S GYM.
OH, YEAH, LIKE I REALLY WANT MICHELLE'S BODY.
THEY HAVE AN ADULT GYM DOWN THERE, TOO.
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.
SATURDAY, WE'LL GET THE WHOLE FAMILY TO GO DOWN, THEY CAN ALL USE A LITTLE TONING UP.
OF COURSE, IN MY CASE, I'D JUST BE TONING TONE.
I'LL PROVIDE THE WORKOUT MUSIC.
STEPHANIE YES, MICHELLE?
YOU ARE NOT GOOD.
NO, IT'S JUST SHE'S MISSING ONE NOTE.
HERE, I'LL SHOW YOU THE NOTE.
OBSERVE.
YOU ARE NOT GOOD, TOO.
WAIT A MINUTE.
SOMETHING'S STUCK IN HERE.
THAT'S WHERE I STUCK MY GUM.
THAT IS NOT FUNNY.
AW, LOOK AT THAT, COMET.
YOU CAN SEE YOURSELF.
THAT'S WHAT I GET FOR SHOWING OFF.
DOING DISHES?
ANOTHER BIG SATURDAY, HUH, MR.
T?
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU, TOO, KIMMY.
D.J., YOU MISSED LUNCH, BUT I SAVED YOU A SANDWICH.
OH WELL, GREAT.
THANKS, DAD.
HEY, CHECK OUT MY NEW BATHING SUIT FOR MY POOL PARTY.
IT'S YOU, KIMMY-- LOUD.
D.J., YOU EAT UP.
WE'RE ALL GOING TO THE GYM.
I'M SKIPPING LUNCH.
DO YOU WANT MY SANDWICH?
YEAH, SURE.
HAM?
AGAIN?
I'VE BEEN EATING YOUR LUNCH FOR THREE DAYS AND EVERY SANDWICH IS HAM.
DID YOUR DAD HIT A PIG WITH HIS CAR?
GOODBYE, KIMMY.
D.J., YOU'RE GIVING YOUR LUNCHES TO KIMMY?
YEAH, SO WHAT?
YOU'VE BEEN SKIPPING BREAKFAST AND DINNER, TOO.
I'M NOT AN EXPERT ON THIS BUT SHOULDN'T A PERSON EAT?
UH, YOU'RE RIGHT, STEPH.
I'LL EAT MY SANDWICH.
YOU PROMISE?
I PROMISE.
MUCH BETTER.
NOW GET YOURSELF AN APPLE AND A GLASS OF MILK.
AND YOUR BASIC FOOD GROUPS ARE COVERED.
COME HERE, COMET.
LOOK WHAT I HAVE FOR YOU-- PEOPLE FOOD.
YOU'RE LUCKY.
DOGS DON'T HAVE TO WEAR BATHING SUITS.
D.J.!
YOU PROMISED YOU'D EAT YOUR SANDWICH.
YOU LIED.
COMET STOLE IT RIGHT OUR OF MY HAND.
YOU'RE LYING AGAIN.
NO, I'M NOT.
LIE NUMBER THREE.
WHEN WILL THIS END?
LOOK, STEPH.
I'VE GOT ONE WEEK TO LOOK GOOD IN A BATHING SUIT IN FRONT OF MY FRIENDS.
YOU KNOW, WHEN THE PARTY'S OVER, I'LL START EATING AGAIN.
BUT UNTIL THEN, THIS IS OUR SECRET.
NOW GIVE ME YOUR PINKIE.
NO, NOT THE PINKIE.
YES, THE PINKIE.
YOU HAVE TO PINKIE SWEAR THAT YOU WON'T TELL ANYONE I HAVEN'T BEEN EATING.
NOW HOOK UP.
NOW SAY IT.
PINKIE SWEAR.
PINKIE SWEAR.
BUT I DON'T LIKE IT.
WELL, TOO BAD.
YOUR LIPS ARE SEALED.
IT SMELLS LIKE A SWEAT SOCK IN HERE.
YEP, THESE ARE MY PEOPLE.
WHAT DO YOU BENCH, DUDE?
BEGINNER, HUH?
IT'S COOL.
IT BETTER BE.
HEY, MISTER, YOU ARE VERY LUMPY.
I HOPE YOU'RE NOT OFFENDED.
BUT IF YOU ARE, THAT'S HER FATHER RIGHT THERE.
SO WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO BURN OFF CALORIES?
WELL, YOU MAKE IT FUN.
YOU COULD RIDE A BIKE.
I LOVED RIDING A BIKE WHEN I WAS A KID.
OF COURSE, MY BANANA SEAT HUFFY DIDN'T HAVE AN ONBOARD COMPUTER.
SWEETHEART, START OFF SLOW ON NUMBER 1.
YOU DON'T WANNA DO TOO MUCH TOO SOON, OKAY?
GOT IT.
COME ON, STEPH, LET'S GO STRETCH BEFORE AEROBICS CLASS.

OKAY, LET'S KEEP IT MOVING OUT THERE!

OH, YEAH?
DO YOU ALWAYS HAVE TEARS IN YOUR EYES WHEN YOU EXERCISE?

NOW THAT WE'RE ALL WARMED UP, LET'S START THE CLASS.
I'M GONNA GO WORK OUT WITH MICHELLE.
I BETTER GO WITH YOU.
I BETTER STAY HERE.
WHY?
'CAUSE I CAN'T MOVE.
DEEJ, COME OVER TO AEROBICS.
YOU'RE MISSING THE FUN.
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.
DAD!
D.J.!
D.J., ARE YOU OK?
YEAH, I JUST GOT A LITTLE DIZZY.
HERE, DRINK THIS.
HOW DO YOU FEEL NOW, DEEJ?
UH, I'M OK.
I GUESS I JUST OVERDID IT.
BUT, D.J.-- STEPH, I'M OK.
I THINK WE BETTER GO GET MICHELLE AND GO HOME.
COME ON.
HI, GUYS.
HEY, D.J. YOU FEELING BETTER AFTER YOUR NAP, HONEY?
YEAH, I'M AS GOOD AS NEW.
ARE YOU SURE?
YES, I'M SURE.
ARE YOU REALLY SURE?
WOULD EVERYBODY QUIT MAKING SUCH A BIG DEAL ABOUT THIS?
DEEJ, I MADE YOUR FAVORITE-- CHICKEN PARMESAN.
COME HERE AND CHECK OUT THIS SAUCE.
ICAN'T.
I JUST BRUSHED MY TEETH.
BEFORE DINNER?
DOESN'T ANYBODY CARE ABOUT DENTAL HYGIENE AROUND HERE?
WHOA, D.J., CALM DOWN.
I HAPPEN TO CARE VERY DEEPLY ABOUT OUR FAMILY'S TEETH AND GUMS.
NOW, WHAT'S GOING ON?
NOTHING IS GOING ON.
I'M GOING TO KIMMY'S FOR DINNER.
DON'T BELIEVE HER, DAD.
STEPH, YOU PINKIE SWORE.
I DON'T CARE.
I DON'T WANT YOU TO GET SICK.
DAD, I KNOW WHY D.J.'S ACTING SO CRANKY AND WHY SHE GOT DIZZY TODAY.
SHE HASN'T EATEN ANYTHING IN THREE DAYS.
IS THAT TRUE?
YOU HAVEN'T EATEN ANYTHING IN THREE DAYS?
D.J., I THINK YOU SHOULD SIT DOWN AND EAT RIGHT NOW.
I CAN'T.
I'M FINALLY STARTING TO LOSE WEIGHT.
D.J. YOU'RE STARVING YOURSELF.
YOU COULD DO SERIOUS DAMAGE TO YOUR BODY.
DEEJ, THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR CAN LEAD TO SERIOUS EATING DISORDERS-- ANOREXIA, BULIMIA.
YOU'RE HEADED DOWN A DANGEROUS ROAD HERE.
I DON'T CARE.
I'M THE ONE THAT HAS TO WEAR THE BATHING SUIT NEXT WEEK.
IT'S MY LIFE AND I CAN DO WHATEVER I WANT.
DEEJ, HANG ON A MINUTE.
I HOPE SHE'S NOT MAD AT ME.
NAH.
YOU DID THE RIGHT THING.
SHE'S LUCKY TO HAVE A SISTER LIKE YOU.
D.J., WE HAVE TO TALK.
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
I DON'T LIKE THE WAY I LOOK.
I WANNA LOOK LIKE THESE MODELS.
WHY?
BECAUSE THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL.
WELL, SO ARE YOU.
OH, YEAH?
WELL SHOW ME ONE GIRL IN HERE WITH THIS ROUND FACE AND THESE CHARLIE BROWN CHEEKS.
HONEY, PEOPLE COME IN ALL DIFFERENT SHAPES AND SIZES.
EVERYBODY WISHES THEY COULD CHANGE SOMETHING ABOUT THEMSELVES.
HECK, WHEN I WAS A KID, I WISHED I COULD'VE BEEN MORE LIKE THAT GUY ON THE INCREDIBLE HULK.
YOU WANNA BE A BIG GREEN MONSTER WITH MUSCLES?
NO, NOT HIM, THE OTHER GUY.
THE GUY THAT TURNED INTO THE HULK.
HE WAS JUST NICE AND AVERAGE.
HE WASN'T TOO TALL, HE WASN'T TOO SKINNY.
HE DIDN'T STICK OUT LIKE I THOUGHT I DID.
THEN I REALIZED HE DIDN'T HAVE IT SO EASY, EITHER.
EVERY TIME HE LOST HIS TEMPER, HE HAD TO BUY A NEW SHIRT.
WELL YOU MADE ME SMILE, BUT THERE'S STILL NO WAY I'M WEARING A BATHING SUIT IN FRONT OF MY FRIENDS.
OK, LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.
WHY DO YOU LIKE YOUR FRIENDS?
BECAUSE THEY'RE NICE, AND WE HAVE FUN TOGETHER, AND WE DO STUFF FOR EACH OTHER.
NOT BECAUSE THEY ALL LOOK LIKE MODELS?
NO.
MAYBE THAT'S BECAUSE DEEP DOWN INSIDE YOU KNOW THAT HOW A PERSON LOOKS ON THE OUTSIDE ISN'T NEARLY AS IMPORTANT AS WHO THEY ARE ON THE INSIDE, RIGHT?
RIGHT.
HONEY, I JUST WISH YOU WOULD TRY TO SEE YOURSELF THE WAY YOU SEE YOUR FRIENDS.
DEEJ, YOU GOT SUCH A GOOD HEART.
YOU CARE ABOUT PEOPLE.
THAT'S WHY PEOPLE CARE ABOUT YOU.
AND EVERYBODY WHO KNOWS THE REAL D.J. THINKS SHE'S PRETTY TERRIFIC.
THANKS, DAD.
I LOVE YOU.
I LOVE YOU, TOO.
THAT'S WHY I WANT YOU TO TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.
I WANT YOU TO PROMISE ME THAT YOU'RE GONNA EAT HEALTHY AND EXERCISE THE RIGHT WAY.
I PROMISE.
NO MORE CRASH DIETS.
I'M GONNA GO TO KIMMY'S PARTY AND HAVE FUN WITH MY FRIENDS.
GREAT.
ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANNA TALK ABOUT?
YEAH.
IS DINNER READY?
LET'S GO CHECK.
WELL FIRST, I'LL START OUT WITH A SALAD, DRESSING ON THE SIDE.
OOH.

HEY.
STEPH, WHAT'S GOING ON?
I'M JUST FINISHING COMET'S BIRTHDAY CAKE.
I MADE HIS FAVORITE-- MEAT LOAF WITH CHEESE FROSTING.
THAT LOOKS JUST GREAT.
JUST DON'T ASK ME TO LICK OFF THE SPOON, OK?
DO I SEE A CAKE?
THIS IS FOR COMET'S BIRTHDAY PARTY.
KEEP YOUR PAWS OFF.
I'LL TRY.
BUT BIRTHDAY CAKE MAKES ME CRAZY!
DID I JUST HEAR YOU SAY YOU'RE THROWING A BIRTHDAY PARTY FOR COMET?
LOOK, I KNOW HE'S FAMILY, BUT-- SHHH!
NOT IN FRONT OF THE D-O-G.
I CAN SPELL MICHELLE.
M-I-C- H-E-L- L-L-LE!
THAT WAS VERY GOOD, MICHELLE-EL-EL-EL-EL- EL-EL.
DAD, COULD YOU GET COMET OUT OF THE HOUSE LATER SO JOEY AND I CAN SET UP HIS SURPRISE PARTY?
OH, AND WHERE DO YOU WANT ME TO TAKE HIM, DINNER AND A MOVIE?
DON'T BE SILLY.
HE'S A DOG.
TAKE HIM SHOPPING.

YUCK!

MY OLD GIRLFRIEND CARRIE SINGING OUR OLD SONG.
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.
ME NEITHER.
YOUR SONG WAS MUSKRAT LOVE?
IT WAS PLAYING THE FIRST TIME WE KISSED.
WHERE WERE YOU?
IN AN ELEVATOR?
DON'T BE DUMB.
IT WAS A DENTIST'S OFFICE.
JOSEPH, YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN HER.
SHE HAD THE MOST INCREDIBLE HYPNOTIC EYES, THE FACE OF AN ANGEL, THE MOST AMAZING BODY REMEMBER BECKY?
SHE WAS OK.
CARRIE FOWLER SHE WAS LIKE MY FIRST GREAT LOVE, YOU KNOW?
YEAH.
ME AND HER HAD ALL THESE DREAMS, WE DREAMT OF GETTING MARRIED, HAVING KIDS, GRADUATING I HAVEN'T SEEN HER IN 10 YEARS AND I'M GONNA SEE HER TONIGHT.
JESS, WHAT HAPPENS IF ALL THOSE OLD FEELINGS COME BACK?
YOU'RE ENGAGED.
OH, MY GOD.
I'M NOT GOING.
OH, COME ON, JESS, YOU'VE GOTTA GO TO YOUR HIGH SCHOOL REUNION.
YOU JUST BRING SOMEBODY ALONG THAT CAN, YOU KNOW, DISTRACT HER.
SOMEBODY INTELLIGENT, SEXY, EXTREMELY ATTRACTIVE YOU'RE RIGHT, JOEY.
BECKY!
IN HERE, JESS!
OH, I'M GLAD YOU'RE STILL HERE.
LISTEN, REMEMBER I SAID THAT YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO COME TO MY REUNION, BECAUSE YOU'D BE BORED TO DEATH?
YES.
I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH.
YOU'RE WELCOME AND YOU'RE COMING.
JESSE!
REBECCA'S TAKING ME AND KIMMY DOWN TO THE STATION.
WE GET TO EYEWITNESS EYEWITNESS NEWS.
BUT THIS IS MY WANNA SHOW OFF MY FIANCEE.
BOY, YOU ARE ANCIENT.
THAT MEANS YOU STARTED HIGH SCHOOL BEFORE I WAS EVEN BORN.
THAT'S WHY WE CALL THEM THE GOOD OLD DAYS.
WELL THIS IS RESEARCH FOR AN ARTICLE FOR THE SCHOOL PAPER.
I'M THE EDITOR.
AND I GAVE MYSELF AN ASSIGNMENT.
SO IF I DON'T COME THROUGH FOR ME, I'M GONNA HAVE TO GIVE MYSELF A STERN LECTURE IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE CLASS.
AND IT'S HARD TO DO "THIS" TO YOURSELF.
I BETTER GO.
YEAH, AT WHAT TIME DOES THE PLEASE TELL ME YOU'RE KIDDING.
I'M SORRY, SWEETHEART.
I PROMISED THE GIRLS.
HAVE A GREAT TIME AT YOUR REUNION.
OKAY, I JUST WANNA GIVE YOU A GOODBYE KISS.
JUST ONE MORE, JUST-- JESS YOU ARE COMING BACK, AREN'T YOU?
WELL, HERE WE ARE, BIRTHDAY BOY.
HOME AGAIN AFTER OUR LONG, LONG WALK.
HM, COMET, I WONDER WHY IT'S SO QUIET IN THERE.
WHY DON'T WE GO IN AND SEE?
SURPRISE!
THIS IS SO GREAT!
DID YOU SEE THE LOOK ON COMET'S FACE?
WHAT ABOUT THE LOOK ON MY FACE?
STEPH, I THINK IT'S WONDERFUL THAT YOU WANTED TO THROW COMET A PARTY, BUT YOU HAD TO INVITE EVERY DOG ON THE BLOCK?
DOES ANYBODY HERE HAVE TO USE THE HYDRANT?
HEY, DON'T TAKE IT PERSONALLY, GUYS.
HE SAYS THAT TO ALL HIS DINNER GUESTS.
DAD, YOU KNOW ALL OF COMET'S FRIENDS THERE'S BOBO, WINKIE, SPARKY, ZSA ZSA, AND JAWS.
OH, THANK YOU.
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU, TOO, JAWS.

JESS, YOU SURE YOU WANNA START PLAYING NOW?
DIDN'T WE USED TO LIKE TO WAIT UNTIL, YOU KNOW, CARRIE WAS SITTING UP THERE, REALLY NICE AND CLOSE, WATCHING YOU.
I'M HAPPILY ENGAGED.
CARRIE MEANS NOTHING TO ME.
ALL RIGHT!
WELCOME BACK TO 1980!

HI.
HAMMER, SHE WANTS YOU.
YEAH!
IN MY DREAMS!
GET DOWN THERE.
OKAY.
I CAN SAY HI TO AN OLD FRIEND.
THAT'S WHAT REUNIONS ARE ALL ABOUT.
HEY, CARRIE, OLD BUDDY.
HOW ARE YOU DOING?
JESSE, COME HERE.
HEY, LOOK WHO'S ON THE DANCE FLOOR.
GOLDEN BAY HIGH'S HOTTEST COUPLE OF 1980, PICKING UP RIGHT WHERE THEY LEFT OFF.
HI.
I CAN SAY HI TO ALL MY FRIENDS AND I'LL BE AROUND TO HUG EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU MOMENTARILY.
AND, BELIEVE IT OR NOT, THIS WAS JESSE AND CARRIE'S SONG MUSKRAT LOVE.
JESS, WE HAVE TO DANCE.
OK.
COME ON!
IT IS SO GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU, TOO.
BEEN IN EUROPE THIS WHOLE TIME?
YEAH.
I'M REALLY SORRY WE LOST TOUCH, JESSE.
BUTWE'RE TOUCHING NOW.
DID I MENTION I'M ENGAGED?
'CAUSE I AM.
I'M ENGAGED.
I'M AN ENGAGED GUY.
HAPPY, HAPPY, HAPPY ENGAGED!
I MEAN PEOPLE DOWN THE STREET AND GO, "WHOA".
YOU KNOW?
"THERE GOES A HAPPY ENGAGED GUY".
BUT YOU'RE NOT MARRIED YET?
NO.
WELL, MAYBE THERE'S A REASON THAT FATE BROUGHT US TOGETHER TONIGHT.
IT WASN'T FATE, IT WAS THE REUNION COMMITTEE.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
JESSE, LOOK.
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW I WAS GONNA FEEL SEEING YOU AGAIN.
BUT BEING BACK IN YOUR ARMS, IT'S LIKE NOTHING'S CHANGED.
DON'T YOU REMEMBER THE LAST TIME WE WERE TOGETHER?
JESSE, YOU'RE GONNA GET IN TROUBLE.
I GRADUATE TOMORROW.
WHAT'LL THEY DO?
EXPEL ME?
COME ON.
LET'S GO TAKE THIS BABY TO THE LIBRARY.
I ALWAYS WONDERED WHAT IT WOULD LOOK IN THERE.
JESSE, WAIT A MINUTE.
WE HAVE TO TALK.
YOU REMEMBER WHEN I SENT MY PICTURES TO THAT MODELING AGENCY.
YEAH.
WELL, THEY LOVED THEM.
AND THEY OFFERED ME A JOB IN PARIS.
IN PARIS?
YOU CAN'T GO TO PARIS.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN I CAN'T GO?
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO COME ON THE ROAD WITH ME AND MY BAND.
WHAT ABOUT MY MODELING CAREER?
JESSE, THIS IS THE BIGGEST BREAK I'VE EVER HAD.
YOU WANT ME TO THROW IT AWAY?
YEAH.
MY BAND'S REALLY STARTING TO TAKE OFF NOW.
SOMEDAY WE'RE GONNA BE AS BIG AS THE VILLAGE PEOPLE.
HOW CAN YOU BE SO SELFISH?
WHAT ABOUT ME?
WHAT ABOUT ME?
NO, WHAT ABOUT ME?
NO, WHAT ABOUT ME?
WHAT ABOUT US?
IT SOUNDS LIKE WE'RE BREAKING UP.
I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.
NEITHER DO I. ALL RIGHT.
LISTEN.
GO DO YOUR MODELING THING.
I'LL GO DO MY ROCK 'N' ROLL.
AND I PROMISE YOU, AS SOON AS YOU GET BACK, WE'RE GONNA PICK IT UP WHERE WE LEFT OFF.
YOU REALLY MEAN THAT?
READ MY LIPS.
JESS, THIS IS OUR SECOND CHANCE.
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BREAK YOUR PROMISE, ARE YOU?
CARRIE, THAT WAS I KNOW, BUT IT STILL DOESN'T FEEL OVER.
DOES IT?
I DON'T KNOW.
CARRIE, I GOTTA GO.
I'M SORRY.
SPARKY!
SPARKY!
SPARKY!
WELL, I WALKED ALL THE OTHER DOGS HOME.
ANY LUCK FINDING SPARKY YET?
NOT A TRACEBUT I DID FIND 38 CENTS AND A RUBBER PORK CHOP.
IF YOU WERE A DOG, WHERE WOULD YOU BE?
HMM.
DRINKING WATER OUT OF THE TOILET.
I'LL GO CHECK.
LET'S GET COMET TO HELP US FIND SPARKY.
I'M AFRAID COMET'S A LITTLE PARTIED OUT RIGHT NOW.
YOU CAN BE MY DOG.
I'LL CALL YOU PEANUT.
MICHELLE!
GO HIDE ON THE BED.
BUT NO BARKING.
HEY, MICHELLE, HAVE YOU SEEN SPARKY?
NO SPARKY HERE.
HAVE A NICE DAY.
DID THAT BUNNY RABBIT JUST BARK?
THAT WAS ME.
ARF ARF ARF ARF ARF ARF ARF ARF  MAYBE IT'S A DOGGIE.
MAYBE IT'S SPARKY.
HIS NAME IS PEANUT, AND HE'S MY DOGGIE.
BUT MICHELLE, YOU ALREADY HAVE A DOGGIE.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH COMET?
ONE DAY COMET WAS THIS BIG.
NOW HE'S THIS BIG.
OH, I SEE, YOU WANT A DOG THAT'S YOUR SIZE.
WELL, THE REASON THAT COMET GOT SO BIG IS BECAUSE DOGS GROW FASTER THAN PEOPLE.
BUT COMET'S ALL FINISHED GROWING.
AND YOU'RE STILL GETTING BIGGER.
SO AS YOU GET BIGGER, COMET'LL SEEM TO BE GETTING SMALLER, EVEN THOUGH IN FACT HE'S STAYING THE SAME SIZE.
UNDERSTAND?
ARE YOU NUTS?
HOW ABOUT IF I TAKE SPARKY HOME, AND THEN I MAKE YOU A DOUBLE-SCOOP ICE CREAM SUNDAE?
YOU GOT IT, DUDE.
NEXT TIME, I'LL SKIP THE SPEECH AND GO STRAIGHT FOR THE ICE CREAM.
DANNY!
I GOTTA TALK TO YOU.
JUST A MINUTE, A FEW OF COMET'S FRIENDS LEFT THEIR COATS BEHIND.
DANNY, THIS IS IMPORTANT.
LISTEN.
I WAS DANCING WITH MY OLD GIRLFRIEND CARRIE, AND THEY PLAYED MUSKRAT LOVE, RIGHT?
AND I HAD TO RUN RIGHT OUT OF THE GYM.
YOU KNOW, OF ALL THE SONGS ABOUT MUSKRATS, THAT ONE WAS MY FAVORITE.
* MUSKRAT SUZIE, MUSKRAT SAM ** DANIEL!
PLEASE.
COME ON.
I NEED YOUR HELP HERE.
I JUST KEPT THINKING, WHAT IF I SAW CARRIE BEFORE I MET BECKY?
WHAT IF INSTEAD OF THEY HAD YOU KNOW, WHAT IF I SAW, AND WHAT IF I DANCED WITH HER, AND WHAT IF I KISSED HER, AND WHAT IF I LIKED IT?
AND WHAT IF BECKY HEARS YOU?
SHE'S UPSTAIRS WITH THE GIRLS.
BECKY'S HERE?
JESS, JESS, COME HERE.
CALM DOWN.
LOOK I THINK WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS SORT OUT YOUR FEELINGS.
LIKE YOU WOULD SORT OUT YOUR LAUNDRY.
DANIEL.
NO, STAY WITH ME ON THIS.
THINK OF YOUR FEELINGS FOR BECKY AS YOUR WHITES, AND YOUR FEELINGS FOR CARRIE AS YOUR DARKS.
NOW, MAKE SURE YOU DO SEPARATE LOADS.
SEE, OTHERWISE A RED SOCK CAN GET IN WITH WITH YOUR WHITES, AND YOU WIND UP WITH PINK UNDERWEAR.
I'M SORRY.
THESE LAUNDRY ANALOGIES ARE HIGHLY SOPHISTICATED.
I THINK BECKY'S THE GREATEST.
BUT IT'S NOT FAIR FOR EITHER OF YOU TO GET MARRIED, IF YOU'RE NOT SURE ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS.
WHATEVER YOU NEED TO DO TO SORT THIS THING OUT, YOU BETTER DO IT RIGHT NOW.
HI, JESS.
WHO'S THAT?
IT'S THE RED SOCK.
CARRIE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I'M HERE TO FIND OUT WHY YOU WALKED OUT ON ME TONIGHT.
CARRIE, I'M SORRY IF I HURT YOUR FEELINGS, BUT WELL, I THOUGHT I HAD MY WHOLE LIFE FIGURED OUT AND THEN YOU SHOW UP, AND NOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.
I THINK YOU'RE SCARED THAT YOU STILL HAVE FEELINGS FOR ME.
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND OUT.
CARRIE WELL?
WELL THAT WAS A WONDERFUL KISS.
AND IT MADE ME THINK OF ALL THE GREAT TIMES WE HAD TOGETHER.
BUT, CARRIE, IT MADE ME REALIZE THAT EVERYTHING WE HAVE IS IN THE PAST.
SO IT'S REALLY OVER?
YEAH.
IT'S REALLY OVER.
WELL, I NEEDED TO KNOW.
ME, TOO.
THANKS FOR THE DANCE.
GOODBYE, JESSE.
GOODBYE, CARRIE.
BECKY!
BECKY!
I'M SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU!
WHAT HAPPENED?
HOW WAS YOUR RE UNION?
YOU WON'T BELIEVE IT.
THE MOST INCREDIBLE THING HAPPENED.
REALLY?
YEAH.
I SAW MY OLD GIRLFRIEND, AND SHE LOOKED SO BEAUTIFUL.
REALLY?
YEAH, YEAH.
AND THEN-- GET THIS-- WE SLOW-DANCED TO OUR SONG.
REALLY?
YEAH.
AND THEN WE KISSED, OK?
YOU KISSED HER?
YEAH, BUT LISTEN, SEE-- YOU KISSED HER?
LISTEN ONE SECOND, BECKY.
SEE-- YOU KISSED HER?
YES, I KISSED HER.
BUT THE BEST PART WAS AFTER THE KISS.
I'LL KILL YOU!
BECKY, LISTEN.
WHEN I KISSED HER, I REALIZED THAT I NEVER WANNA KISS ANYONE BUT YOU FOR AS LONG AS I LIVE.
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.
OH, JESS.
WHY DID YOU HAVE TO GO AND KISS HER?
WELL IT'S JUST PART OF MY PAST THAT I HAD TO CLEAR UP.
I MEAN, LET'S FACE IT.
YOU KNOW, GETTING MARRIED IS THE BIGGEST DECISION I'VE EVER HAD TO MAKE IN MY LIFE.
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE HAVING ANY DOUBTS.
WELL, NOT DOUBTS EXACTLY.
THEY'RE MORE LIKE LITTLE DOUBTLETS.
I GUESS I UNDERSTAND.
IT TOOK ME TWO YEARS TO SAY YES.
SO NOW ARE YOU I'M SURE THAT I LOVE YOU.
AND THAT'S ALL I NEED.
I MEAN, THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES, BUT I BELIEVE IN YOU.
AND I BELIEVE IN US.
SO DO I, BECKY.
AND I KNOW IN MY HEART THAT THIS IS GONNA WORK.
I LOVE YOU.
HAVE MERCY!
HAVE MERCY!
HONEY, JUST ONE LITTLE QUESTION.
YEAH?
WHEN IS YOUR NEXT HIGH-SCHOOL REUNION?
I'M GOING.
CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY WARNER BROS.

{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
COME ON.
BECKY, WE HAVEN'T EVEN SET A DATE FOR THE WEDDING YET, AND YOU GOT ME TRYING ON GOOFY HATS.
BESIDES, THE GUESTS WILL BE DISAPPOINTED.
THEY ARE COMING TO SEE MY HAIR.
WELL, I WOULD LIKE A FORMAL WEDDING AND I THINK A TOP HAT AND TAILS IS VERY ELEGANT.
BUT WE CAN GET AN OBJECTIVE OPINION.
MICHELLE, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF YOUR UNCLE JESSE?
YOU LOOK VERY HANDSOME.
BECKY TELL YOU TO SAY THAT?
YES, SHE DID.
AND DID SHE GIVE YOU SOMETHING?
YES, SHE DID.
ALL RIGHT.
HERE'S A BUCK.
TELL ME WHAT YOU REALLY THINK.
YOU LOOK LIKE THE CAT IN THE HAT.
I'M NOT GETTING MARRIED DRESSED LIKE A DR.
SEUSS CARTOON.
BESIDES, A FORMAL WEDDING DOESN'T COINCIDE WITH MY WHOLE VIVA LAS VEGAS MOTIF.
WHAT?
HEY, IT'S DARK IN HERE.
YOU GOT A FAT HEAD.
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.
GIVE ME MY BUCK BACK.
I STILL GOT MY LOLLIPOP.

MARTINIZING.
OH, YES.
THIS IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN WHEN JULIO DELIVERED THE CLEANING.

YOU WALKED INTO MY CLEANING STORE WITH ALL OF YOUR DIRTY CLOTHES SEPARATED IN THE 4 BASIC STAIN GROUPS.
GROUND-IN, CAKED-ON, SOAKED-UP, AND "EW, GROSS".
I BETTER GET BACK.
I LEFT JULIO RUNNING THE STORE.

WHAT IS THIS, A JULIE ANDREWS MOVIE?
THEN GO WITH IT, JESS.

LOOK, CINDY'S REALLY SPECIAL, AND I REALLY LIKE HER, AND WE REALLY HIT IT OFF.

CINDY, RUSTY, YOU MADE IT.
HI.
DID YOU HEAR THAT?
ISN'T SHE THE GREATEST?
CINDY, RUSTY, I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET THE TANNER BUNCH FROM THE TALLEST TO THE SMALLEST.
I'M DANNY.
THIS IS JESSE, JOEY, REBECCA, D.J., STEPHANIE, MICHELLE, AND THAT'S COMET.
MY DADDY LIKES YOU.
OH, THAT'S SO SWEET.
THANKS.

I DON'T KNOW WHERE SHE GETS THIS STUFF.
ALL RIGHT.
COME ON.
CHOW'S ON.
FOLLOW ME.
* MI, A NAME I CALL MYSELF * * FA, A LONG, LONG WAY TO RUN ** I HEARD THE FUNNIEST JOKE YESTERDAY-- A MONKEY WALKS INTO A BARBER SHOP-- OH, THAT'S MY FAVORITE JOKE.
IT ENDS WITH-- "BUT GET YOUR HANDS OFF MY CIGAR".
IT'S EVEN FUNNIER WITH THE MIDDLE PART.
SO CINDY, DID YOU KNOW THAT JESSE AND REBECCA ARE GETTING MARRIED?
OH, REALLY?
THAT'S WONDERFUL.
WHEN?
WELL, WE HAVEN'T SET A DATE YET, BUT WE DEFINITELY KNOW WHERE.
TENNESSEE.
NEBRASKA.
NEBRASKA?
THAT'S WHERE MY FAMILY IS.
WHAT'S IN TENNESSEE?
CLEAN AIR, FRIENDLY FOLKS, GRACELAND.
DID YOU JUST COUGH GRACELAND?
YEAH.
I'M NOT GOING ALL THE WAY TO GRACELAND TO GET MARRIED IN SOME GUITAR-SHAPED CHAPEL.
IT'S A GUITAR-SHAPED POOL, ALL RIGHT?
THE CHAPEL'S A GIANT SIDEBURN.
PARDON ME.
I HAVE TO CALL MY STORE.
SO RUSTY, WHAT ARE YOU INTO, CUB SCOUTS, LITTLE LEAGUE?
TO TELL THE TRUTH, MR.
TANNER, I'M KIND OF A-- A LONER.
PASS ME THE SALT, WILL YOU?
SURE.
THANKS.
OW!
THAT'S FOR UNSCREWING THE SALT SHAKER, MR.
MATURITY.
IT WASN'T ME.
I HAVEN'T PULLED THAT BIT SINCE JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL.
OK.
HIGH SCHOOL.
ALL RIGHT, IT WAS LAST WEEK AT THE SIZZLER.
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO HIT ME.
I'M REALLY SORRY, YOU GUYS.
THERE'S A PROBLEM DOWN AT THE STORE.
BUT WE SHOULDN'T BE LONG.
COME ON, RUSTY.
MOM, I'M STILL EATING.
WE'LL TAKE IT TO GO.
AW, COME ON, I HARDLY GOT TO KNOW THE LITTLE GUY.
WHY DON'T YOU GO ON AHEAD, AND LET RUSTY HANG OUT HERE WITH US.
ALL RIGHT.
I SHOULDN'T BE LONG.
NOW, RUSTY, YOU BE ON YOUR BEST, BEST, BEST BEHAVIOR.
I'LL BE FINE, MOM.
SEE YOU ALL LATER.
BYE-BYE.
MORE MILK, PLEASE.
MISSING, YOU'RE MISSING, YOU'RE MISSING.
I'LL GO GET A TOWEL.
HOW DID THE TABLECLOTH GET TUCKED IN MY PANTS?
I HAVE NEVER PUT ANYTHING DOWN HIS PANTS.
ALL RIGHT.
ONCE, AT THE SIZZLER.
DADDY, IT WASN'T FINISHED.
BOY, YOUR MOM AND MY DAD REALLY LIKE EACH OTHER.
YEAH.
SAY, YOU GIRLS WANT SOME GUM?
SURE.
SURE, THANKS.
ALL OF THE ACCIDENTS AT LUNCH WERE REALLY WEIRD TODAY.
OH, THOSE WEREN'T ACCIDENTS.
THE SALT, THE MILK, THE TABLECLOTH, THE GUM-- ALL COMPLIMENTS OF THE RUSTMAN, MASTER OF DISASTER.
YOU MEAN YOU DID ALL THOSE MEAN, HORRIBLE-- DID HE SAY GUM?
HE SAID GUM.
AAH!
YOU GIRLS BETTER START FLOSSING.
WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM, KID?
NO PROBLEM.
MY PHILOSOPHY IS, IF YOU FALL FOR IT, YOU DESERVE IT.
WELL, MY PHILOSOPHY IS, I'M TELLING.
STEPH, WAIT.
DAD REALLY LIKES CINDY.
AND SHE'LL BE BACK ANY MINUTE.
SO LET'S JUST TRY TO BE NICE TO THE LITTLE RAT.
OK.
WANT SOME CHEESE?
HEY RUSTY, YOUR MOM JUST CALLED.
SHE'S GONNA BE STUCK AT THE STORE FOR THE REST OF THE DAY AND SHE WANTED ME TO PUT YOU IN A CAB AND SEND YOU DOWN THERE.
AWW.
AWW.
BUT I TOLD HER WE COULDN'T DO IT.
IS IT THE MONEY?
I'LL CHIP IN FOR CAB FARE.
TAKE IT OUT OF MY COLLEGE FUND.
THAT'S VERY GENEROUS, GIRLS, BUT I TOLD CINDY WE REALLY WANT RUSTY TO HANG OUT HERE WITH US, RIGHT, GIRLS?
I KNEW YOU'D FEEL THAT WAY.
COME ON, RUSTY.
WHAT DO YOU SAY WE GO OUT IN THE BACK YARD AND PLAY SOME FOOTBALL.
SOUNDS LIKE FUN, MR.
TANNER.
I'LL BE BACK.
YOU KNOW, RUSS?
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THROWING AROUND THE OLD PIG SKIN AND GET THAT GUY-TO-GUY BONDING THING GOING.
OK, I'LL BE JOE MONTANA, YOU BE JERRY RICE.
COULD I BE JOE MONTANA, MR.
TANNER?
HE'S ALWAYS BEEN MY IDOL BEFORE I MET YOU.
AH, RUSS.
OK.
ON 2.
READY, SET, HUT-1, HUT-2.
GO DEEP, MR.
TANNER!
I'M OPEN, JOE!
HERE IT COMES.
YOU CAN GET IT, MR.
TANNER!
RUN, RUN!
DIVE, DIVE!
AAH!
WATCH OUT FOR THAT MUD PUDDLE.
HEH HEH.
TOO BAD.
YOU ALMOST HAD IT.
YOU KNOW, MUD TASTES WORSE THAN IT LOOKS.
YOU MIND IF I HIT THE SHOWERS A LITTLE EARLY?
GOOD IDEA, MR.
TANNER.
I'LL GET TO KNOW THE REST OF YOUR FAMILY.
BEAUTIFUL.
THIS IS GREAT.
YOU WANT SOME STUFFY, BORING, FORMAL WEDDING AT A 4-H CLUB IN NEBRASKA.
OH, AND YOU WANT SOME TACKY, ROCK-A-BILLY SOCK HOP AT GRACELAND, THE WORLD'S LARGEST SOUVENIR STAND.
SHE DIDN'T MEAN IT.
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN, IF THERE'S ONE THING FOR SURE, WHEN THE BAND PLAYS OUR WEDDING SONG, IT HAS GOT TO BE JAILHOUSE ROCK.
YOU WANT THE FIRST WORDS WE DANCE TO AS HUSBAND AND WIFE TO BE, "WARDEN THREW A PARTY IN THE COUNTY JAIL"?
PEOPLE WILL CHOKE ON THEIR CHICKEN.
COME ON.
YOU DON'T THROW THE CHICKEN UNTIL WAY AFTER THE WEDDING DANCE.
AW, THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
ALL WE DO IS ARG-- DID YOU SAY CHICKEN?
YEAH, YEAH I DID.
ME, TOO.
WE FINALLY AGREE ON SOMETHING.
THIS IS IT.
THIS IS A START.
WE'RE BUILDING HERE.
WE HAVE A FOUNDATION TO BUILD OUR LIFE ON.
CHICKEN.
CHICKEN.
BECKY.
TONGUE-TOWN, USA!
RUSTY, AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO BE PLAYING WITH DANNY?
THIS IS WHERE THE ACTION IS.
HEY, HEY, HEY, DON'T TOUCH MY HAIR ACCOUTERMENTS, PLEASE.
HERE.
SIT HERE AND DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING.
I'M TOUCHING THE DRESSER.
"I'M TOUCH--"!
OK.
LISTEN.
I'M HIP TO YOU, WISE GUY.
I KNOW YOU PULLED ALL THOSE STUNTS AT LUNCH.
SINCE DANNY LIKES YOUR MOTHER SO MUCH, I'M LETTING YOU SLIDE.
FROM NOW ON, YOU RESPECT PEOPLE AND THEIR PROPERTY.
CAPISCE?
CAPISCE.
THANKS FOR SETTING ME STRAIGHT, MR.
KATSOPOLIS.
YOU'RE TOUGH, BUT YOU'RE FAIR.
YEAH.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU'RE A GOOD BOY.
HAVE A GOOD DAY, SON.
DID YOU SEE THAT?
THAT'S HOW YOU GOTTA HANDLE KIDS LIKE RUSTY.
BA-DA-BOOM.
KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
GIVE 'EM A LITTLE DISCIPLINE.
THEY'RE LIKE DOGS.
THEY RESPECT YOU FOR IT.
OR THEY LOCK YOU IN YOUR ROOM.
RUSTY!
RUSTY!
RUSTY!
RUSTY!
RUSTY!
HEY RUSTY, WHAT BRINGS YOU DOWN TO MY NECK OF THE HOUSE?
I WAS JUST ADMIRING YOUR EQUIPMENT, MR.
GLADSTONE.
WELL, I'M PUTTING TOGETHER A TAPE OF MY COMEDY ACT.
I SPECIALIZE IN SOME PRETTY DARN OBSCURE IMPRESSIONS.
CHECK THIS OUT.
THIS ONE IS MR.
WOODCHUCK.
"HEY, RUSTY.
SAY, IS THAT TABLE MADE OF WOOD"?
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
CHECK THIS ONE OUT.
THIS ONE'S GREAT.
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE IT.
BOB HOPE.
"HEY, I WANNA TELL YOU, THAT'S WILD, AIN'T IT, RUSTY?
ISN'T THAT SOMETHING"?
THIS IS AN IMPRESSION OF MR.
WOODCHUCK DOING AN IMPRESSION OF BOB HOPE.
HERE WE GO.
"HEY, THAT'S WILD, HUH?
YEAH, ISN'T THAT SOMETHING, RUSTY?
HUH"?
I GOT PLENTY OF OTHER STUFF ON THIS COMEDY TAPE.
I'VE BEEN WORKING ON IT FOR WEEKS.
THIS IS SOME OF MY CLASSIC, ALL-TIME FUNNIEST MOMENTS, SO GET READY TO WATCH JOEY GLADSTONE-- TALK TO HIMSELF.
HI.
I'M JOEY GLADSTONE.
AND WELL, I'VE PUT SOME OF MY FUNNIEST MOMENTS ON THIS HERE T-- THIS IS RUSTYVISION.
HA HA!
RUSTY!
WHY DO WE HAVE TO WASH COMET?
IT'S SO MESSY, AND HE SHAKES WATER ALL OVE-- WOULD YOU RATHER PLAY WITH RUSTY?
COMET, BATH TIME.
LET'S GO, BOY.
HEY, GIRLS.
I HEARD YOU WERE TIED UP FOR A WHILE.
ANYBODY WANNA LOOK AT MY KALEIDOSCOPE?
WE'RE NOT FALLING FOR ANY MORE TRICKS.
EXCUSE US, BUT WE'RE GIVING OUR DOG A BATH.
CARE TO JOIN HIM?
WE HAVE PLENTY OF FLEA POWDER.
GOOD ONE.
YEAH.
GOOD ONE.
BUT THE RUSTMAN LAUGHS LAST.
HEY, THAT'S OUR DINNER.
DON'T WORRY.
I'M JUST BORROWING IT.
OH, PRETTY.
HEY, THAT KALEIDOSCOPE IS NOT FOR YOU.
WHAT'S SO FUNNY?
SORRY, KID.
I GUESS I BETTER SHOW YOU.
YOU'RE IN BIG TROUBLE, MISTER.
STORY OF MY LIFE.
NOW, YOU BETTER MOVE OUT OF THE WAY.
COMET!
COME AND GET IT, BOY!
POT ROAST!
NO, COMET!
STAY IN THE TUB!
RUSTY!
RUSTY!
COME BACK!
MICHELLE, WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR EYE?
IT'S RUSTY'S KALEIDOSCOPE.
WHICH WAY DID THEY GO?
THEY WENT THAT WAY!
GET 'EM!
RUSTY!
RUSTY!
WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHY IS THERE A SOAPY DOG EATING RUMP ROAST ON MY COUCH?
TAKE A WILD GUESS.
RUSTY!
RUSTY!
THAT KID IS BAD NEWS.
MICHELLE, DID RUSTY DO THAT TO YOUR EYE?
WITH HIS KALEIDOSCOPE.
THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE LITTLE RUSTY.
DAD, WAKE UP.
HE'S THE DEVIL BOY.
I--I CAN'T BELIEVE HE DID THIS.
DANNY, JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY, WAS LITTLE RUSTY IN THE BATHROOM BEFORE YOU TOOK A SHOWER?
YEAH.
WHY DO YOU ASK?
RUSTY!
WELL, MY WORK HERE IS DONE.
IT'S BEEN A BLAST, TANNERS.
HOLD IT.
COME HERE, YOU.
NO, JESS.
HE'S MINE.
I'LL HANDLE THIS, EVERYBODY.
BOOK 'EM, DANO.
BE CAREFUL, DADDY.
HE'S VERY TRICKY.
YOU KNOW, YOU LOOK GOOD IN GREEN.
PRANKS ARE ONE THING.
BUT WHEN YOU MESS WITH A MAN'S SHAMPOO, YOU'RE MESSING WITH THE MAN.
IT WASHES RIGHT OUT.
RUSTY, I DON'T GET THIS.
I REALLY WANTED US TO BE FRIENDS.
YOU DON'T WANNA BE MY FRIEND.
YOU WANNA BE MY MOM'S FRIEND.
WELL, I DO LIKE YOUR MOM VERY MUCH.
YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME, 'CAUSE SOMEDAY MY MOM AND DAD ARE GETTING BACK TOGETHER.
OH THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.
LOOK, RUSTY I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.
MY PARENTS ARE DIVORCED, TOO.
IT HURTS THAT THEY'RE NOT TOGETHER.
BUT YOU CAN'T WRECK EVERY RELATIONSHIP THAT YOUR MOM TRIES TO MAKE.
YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT FAIR.
I DON'T WANNA TALK ABOUT IT.
THAT MUST BE YOUR MOM.
GO AHEAD.
TELL ON ME.
HI, CINDY.
HOW'S EVERYTHING AT WORK?
OH, FINE.
HOW'S EVERYTHING HERE?
OH, COULDN'T BE BETTER.
RUSTY'S A GREAT KID.
I AM?
WE HAD A GREAT TIME.
RIGHT, RUSTY?
YEAH.
SURE.
REALLY?
HE WAS GOOD?
OH, IT WAS WONDERFUL, WE DID A LOT OF STUFF, WE TOSSED FOOTBALL, WE PLAYED WITH THE DOG YOU DYED YOUR HAIR GREEN?
OH, YOU NOTICED.
WELL, I-- I STARTED USING IRISH FORMULA.
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE WORKED IN GRADUALLY, YOU KNOW, A LITTLE EACH DAY.
DANNY, I DON'T KNOW HOW HE DID THIS.
I SEARCHED HIM BEFORE HE LEFT THE HOUSE.
YOU AND I ARE GOING TO HAVE A TALK LATER, YOUNG MAN.
I AM REALLY SORRY, DANNY.
YOU KNOW, I WOULDN'T BLAME YOU IF YOU DIDN'T WANT TO SEE ME AGAIN.
CINDY, IT'S GONNA TAKE A LOT MORE THAN A GREEN HEAD TO RUIN THIS RELATIONSHIP.
OF COURSE I WANNA SEE YOU AGAIN.
AND I WANNA SEE RUSTY, TOO.
IS THAT OK WITH YOU, RUSTY?
THAT'LL BE COOL, AND I'M SORRY.
YOU'RE OK, MR.
TANNER.
HEY, CALL ME DANNY.
YOU'RE A REAL TOUCHY-FEELY SORT OF GUY, AREN'T YOU, DANNY?
YOU'LL GET USED TO IT.
DIG IN, RUSTY.
YEAH, GO AHEAD.
DRINK YOUR ICE- CREAM SODA.
WAIT A MINUTE.
I AIN'T THE MASTER OF DISASTER FOR NOTHING.
WHAT DID YOU PUT IN IT?
DOG FOOD?
HE'S TOO SMART FOR US, STEPH.
I'LL JUST MAKE MY OWN ICE CREAM SODA.
WHERE ARE THE GLASSES?
IN THAT CUPBOARD.
AAH!
HEY!
AAH!
HEY!
GOTCHA, DUDE.
PRETTY GOOD TRICK, GIRLS.
OF COURSE YOU KNOW, THIS MEANS WAR.

WELL, YOU DRIVE A HARD BARGAIN, BUT HERE YOU GO.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
OKAY, NOW TAKE THIS LETTER INTO THE KITCHEN, AND GIVE IT TO YOUR SISTER.
NOW, HERE IS THE FUN PART.
TELL HER IT'S FROM RICKY, THE PAPER BOY.
BUT THAT'S A LIE!
HERE IS ANOTHER NICKEL.
YOU GOT A DEAL, DUDE.
THIS IS GONNA MAKE D.J. CRAZY.
THIS IS FOR MY SISTER.
WHO GAVE THIS TO YOU?
I DO NOT LIE.
IT WAS RUSTY.
BUT I'M KEEPING THE MONEY.
"I'VE LOVED YOU SECRETLY FOR A LONG TIME.
"WHEN I SEE YOU IN THE HOUSE, MY HEART BURNS WITH PASSION.
"I CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT YOUR LOVE.
SIGNED, HOT FOR YOU".
EW!
GROSS!
WHY DID YOU SAY "EW!
GROSS"!
?
BECAUSE RUSTY LOVES ME.
EW!
GROSS!
IF ANYONE FINDS OUT I GOT A LOVE LETTER FROM THAT DUFUS, I'LL DIE.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK, DANNY.
OH, HI, STEPH.
UH, YOUR DAD WANTS THE AIR FRESHENER.
IN THE BACK YARD?
YEAH, HE SAID IT DOESN'T SMELL WOODSY ENOUGH.
THAT'S MY DAD.
YOU'VE GOTTA LOVE HIM.
YOU DO.
CINDY, HOW'S THE MOST BEAUTIFUL DRY CLEANER I'VE EVER KNOWN?
JOEY.
WHAT DID YOU SPILL?
UH, KETCHUP ON MY SHIRT, MUSTARD ON MY PANTS.
I'VE GOTTA STOP MAKING SANDWICHES IN THE CAR.
I'LL TAKE IT OUT TO MY VAN SO I DON'T FORGET.
CINDY, YOU ARE THE BEST.
BY THE WAY, I LEFT A LITTLE NOTE IN THERE FOR YOU.
IT EXPLAINS EVERYTHING.
HIS HEART BURNS WITH PASSION?
HE CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT MY LOVE?
JOEY'S HOT FOR ME?
CINDY?
CIN, YOU'VE GOTTA COME SMELL THE BACK YARD.
IT'S PINE-FOREST FRESH.
I-- I WILL, UM I JUST HAVE TO TAKE OUT JOEY'S LAUNDRY.
OH, AND IT MEANS NOTHING TO ME.
NOTHING.
HI.
I'M TAKING JOEY'S LAUNDRY OUT TO MY VAN.
WELL.
THANK YOU FOR SHARING THAT.
HI, I'M SORRY I'M LATE.
OH, AND THE JELL-O DIDN'T GEL YET.
OH, HEY, THAT'S OK.
WE'LL JUST TELL EVERYONE IT'S LIME SOUP.
BECK, DO ME A FAVOR.
TAKE A LOOK SOME NOTES I MADE FOR TOMORROW'S SHOW.
I'M THINKING ABOUT SOME CHANGES THAT MAY AFFECT US BOTH.
LET ME KNOW HOW YOU FEEL, OKAY?
SURE, I'LL LOOK AT THEM RIGHT NOW.
GREAT.
I'LL GO PUT OUT SOME SOUP BOWLS AND CROUTONS FOR YOUR JELL-O.
OH, MY GOD.
DANNY CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT MY LOVE?
IF JESSE FINDS OUT, HE'LL KILL DANNY.
HMMI WOULD HAVE MY OWN SHOW.
I WENT TO FOUR DIFFERENT STORES TRYING TO FIND DANNY LOW-SODIUM GHERKINS.
HE'S GETTING DILLS, AND HE'S GONNA LIKE THEM.
I NEED A KISS.
I HAVE TO HIDE THIS.
I'VE GOTTA KEEP HIM KISSING ME.
I KNOW WHAT HE LIKES.
OOH, I LIKE THAT.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING BEHIND MY BACK?
UH, NOTHING.
WHAT IS THAT?
OH, A LIBRARY BOOK.
WOULDN'T YOU KNOW?
KIMMY GIBBLER.
AND A MONTH OVERDUE.
BOY, THAT CHILD IS OUT OF CONTROL.
JESS, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN WITH MY PICKLES?
I'VE BEEN WORRIED SICK.
WHERE DO YOU THINK I'VE BEEN?
YOU SENT ME ON A WILD GHERKIN CHASE.
ALL I COULD FIND WERE DILLS.
HERE, ENJOY.
JESS, DILLS?
MY ENTIRE MENU IS BASED AROUND THE GHERKIN.
YOU'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO GO TO PICKLETOWN.
DANNY'S TRYING TO GET RID OF JESSE SO HE CAN BE ALONE WITH ME.
COME ON.
DILLS, GHERKINS-- WHAT'S THE BIG DIFFERENCE?
WHO CARES?
I CARE.
I CARE DEEPLY.
JESS, I'LL GO BRING THE CAR AROUND.
AS LONG AS YOU'RE GOING TO THE STORE, LET ME GO CHECK THE FRIDGE AND SEE IF WE NEED ANY OTHER CONDIMENTS.
OH, WHERE ARE YOU GONNA SEND ME NOW, MUSTARD CITY?
HEY, IT IS RIGHT ACROSS FROM PICKLETOWN.
OH,JESSE.
IF YOU'RE GOING OUT, CAN YOU PICK ME UP A COPY OF TEEN HUNK?
IT HAS A SCRATCH-AND-SNIFF AD FOR "NEW KIDS ON THE BLOCK" COLOGNE.
"A," I DON'T BUY TEEN HUNK.
"2," HERE.
A LITTLE SURPRISE IN THERE FOR YOU, KIMBO.
I GOT TWO NICKELS.
WHAT CAN I BUY WITH THIS?
A DIME.
THAT'S IT?
WHOA, BABY!
JESSE'S HOT FOR ME?
AND WHY NOT?
I'M TWICE THE WOMAN BECKY IS.
YOU BETTER BE NICE TO ME, KID.
IF I MARRY YOUR UNCLE JESSE, I COULD BE YOUR AUNT KIMMY.
NO WAY, JOSE.
NO WAY, JOSE.
I BETTER GO GLAM UP FOR MY MAN.
TIME FOR A LITTLE GLOSS AND FLOSS.
JESS, WHAT'S TAKING SO LONG?
DANNY WANTED ME TO GET A FEW MORE THINGS.
OH, I FORGOT MY SWEATER.
I'LL GET IT.
THANKS.
A LOVE LETTER TO BECKY?
"WHEN I SEE YOU IN THE HOUSE" THIS MUST BE FROM DANNY OR JOEY.
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS LETTER.
ME EITHER.
I'VE GOTTA LEARN TO READ.
MICHELLE, MY DEAREST LITTLE NIECE, COULD YOU GO ON AND ASK YOUR DADDY AND JOEY TO COME IN HERE PLEASE?
IT WILL BE MY PLEASURE.
JESS?
ARE YOU STILL IN THERE?
YEAH?
HONEY, I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO THE STORE.
THERE'S BEEN A CHANGE OF PLANS.
GUYS!
DOES JESSE KNOW DANNY GAVE ME THAT LOVE LETTER?
GENTLEMEN I'M GONNA FIND OUT RIGHT NOW WHICH OF MY BEST FRIENDS IS A BACK-STABBING WEASEL.
OK, WHICH ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS WOULD LIKE TO ESCORT MY FIANCE TO PICKLETOWN?
HEY, I'LL GO.
COME ON, BECKY.
AHA!
SO DANNY'S THE WEASEL WHO WANTS MY WEBECCA.
REBECCA.
DANNY, YOU'VE GOT A MILLION THINGS TO DO.
I'LL TAKE BECKY.
HMM, MAYBE JOEY'S THE REAL REASEL.
WEASEL.
JOEY!
OH, HI, CINDY.
YOU WANNA TAKE A RIDE TO THE STORE?
WITH THE MAN WHO'S TRYING TO STEAL ME FROM DANNY?
SORRY, I HAVEN'T SMELLED THE BACK YARD YET.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS IS JUST STUPID.
I'M JUST GONNA CALL PICKLETOWN.
THEY DELIVER.
IN 30 MINUTES OR LESS, OR YOUR PICKLES ARE FREE.
BECKY, YOU AND I NEED TO TALK.
HELLO, JESSE.
WHAT DO YOU WANT, GIBBLER?
GOOD, PRETEND YOU DON'T LIKE ME.
BECKY WILL NEVER SUSPECT YOU WROTE ME THAT LOVE LETTER.
KIMMY, YOU GOT SOME GUNK IN YOUR EYE.
BECKY, I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, I'LL WANT US TO BE FRIENDS.
THANKS, KIMMY.
THAT'S VERY REASSURING.
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT YOU SAY NOW.
WAIT TILL THAT ROCK IS ON MY FINGER.
I'M GONNA LEARN TO READ IF IT KILLS ME.
THIS IS A "A".
THIS IS A APPLE.
SO WHAT?
HEY, KID.
DID YOU DELIVER THE LETTER I WROTE TO YOUR SISTER?
YES, I DID.
AND WHAT HAPPENED?
EVERYTHING WENT BANANAS.
I LOVE IT!
YOU DID IT, MICHELLE.
WAY TO GO, KID!
COOTCHIE, COOTCHIE.
YOU KNOW WE MAKE A GREAT TEAM TOGETHER.
I'VE GOTTA GET A LOCK FOR MY DOOR.
D.J., YOU'RE NEVER GONNA BELIEVE THIS.
RUSTY WROTE ME A LOVE LETTER.
EW, GROSS!
WHAT IS HE THINKING?
HE'S TWO YEARS OLDER THAN ME, AND HE'S A COMPLETE COOTIE-BURGER.
I'M GONNA GO DUMP HIM.
STEPH, WAIT A SEC.
MAYBE I SHOULD TALK TO HIM.
IT'S JUST POSSIBLE RUSTY MIGHT ACTUALLY HAVE FEELINGS.
NAH!
NAH!
HEY, STEPH, WHAT'S UP?
HOW RUDE!
RUSTY, HAVE A SEAT.
LET'S YOU AND I HAVE A TALK.
LET'S TALK ABOUT LOVE.
OK.
WELL, I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE READY FOR A GIRLFRIEND, BUT IN MY OPINION, YOU NEED A GIRLFRIEND WHO'S OLDER.
MORE MATURE.
OK.
COME ON!
EVERYBODY IN THE KITCHEN!
JUST THINK ABOUT WHAT I SAID, OKAY?
SHE'S ALL OVER ME!
WE'LL TALK LATER.
THAT BABE IS HOT FOR THE RUSTMAN!
OK, COME ON EVERYBODY!
LEND A HAND, IT'S TIME FOR THE FIRST ANNUAL TANNER FAMILY QUALITY TIME BARBECUE.
COME ON, LET'S GO.
EVERYBODY IN LINE.
OH, THIS IS GREAT, IT'S LIKE ONE BIG LOVE TRAIN.
* PEOPLE ROUND THE WORLD JOIN HANDS, UNH * * START A LOVE TRAIN, LOVE TRAIN ** GREAT, I'LL BE THE CABOOSE.
JOEY, STOP.
YOU WANNA BE THE CABOOSE?
JOEY, YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE I CAN TALK TO ABOUT THIS.
IF JESSE EVER FOUND OUT, HE'D GO CRAZY.
BECK, YOU CAN TRUST ME.
I KNOW.
YOU'RE SO SWEET.
OH, HOW DO I SAY THIS?
JOEY, YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES A FRIEND BECOMES SO CLOSE TO ANOTHER FRIEND THAT IT TURNS INTO LOVE, WHICH WOULDN'T BE SO BAD IF ONE OF THOSE FRIENDS WASN'T ENGAGED TO BE MARRIED.
JOEY, IS THIS MAKING ANY SENSE?
COMPLETE SENSE.
HOLY COW!
BECKY'S IN LOVE WITH ME.
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING?
OH, UH, I WAS CHECKING HER PULSE.
YEP.
SHE'S VERY HEALTHY.
MMM.
BOY, THOSE HOT DOGS SMELL GOOD.
NOW I KNOW IT'S JOEY.
I'LL KILL HIM!
GOOD THING HE DOESN'T KNOW.
HE'D KILL ME.
HO.
HO HO.
HA HA HA.
WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THIS LETTER.
I KNOW THIS IS A BAD TIME TO BRING IT UP, BUT I HAD TO GET IT OUT INTO THE OPEN.
BECKY'S IN LOVE WITH ME?
WHY DO I HAVE TO BE SO DARNED ATTRACTIVE?
HIDE THE LETTER.
JESSE'S COMING.
HERE.
YOU DON'T KNOW ME.
YOU NEVER SAW ME.
NOW GO.
HI, JESS.
I THOUGHT IT WAS JOEY, BUT THAT SILLY GUILTY GRIN.
MAYBE IT'S DANNY.
I'LL KILL BOTH OF THEM, SORT IT OUT LATER.
HERE'S YOUR BURGER, HONEY.
HI, JESSE.
I SAVED YOU A SEAT.
KIMMY, YOU'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT EYE OF YOURS.
I'VE GOTTA TELL JOEY HE DOESN'T HAVE A CHANCE WITH ME.
JOEY?
HI, CINDY.
JUST BE HONEST.
YOU HAVE SALAD DRESSING ON YOUR SHIRT.
OH, GEE, THANKS.
WAIT, UH, NO.
THERE'S MORE.
REALLY, WHERE?
NO.
NO.
JOEY, SOMETIMES THE WRONG PEOPLE FALL IN LOVE.
OH, IT'S NOT ANYBODY'S FAULT, IT JUST HAPPENS.
I DON'T WANT DANNY TO GET HURT.
SO LET'S JUST TRY TO CONTROL OUR BURNING PASSIONS, ALL RIGHT?
I'LL TRY MY BEST.
COME ON, GUYS.
TIME FOR BARBECUE FUN.
FIRST BECKY FALLS FOR ME, NOW CINDY?
BOY, THIS NEW KIDS ON THE BLOCK COLOGNE REALLY WORKS.
WELCOME TO THE FIRST ANNUAL TANNER FAMILY QUALITY TIME BARBECUE.
I CAN'T SAY THAT ENOUGH.
NOW, EXACTLY WHAT IS QUALITY TIME?
I WOULD DEFINE IT AS TIME THAT WE ALL GET TO SPEND TOGETHER ONE FALSE MOVE AND RUSTY GET A WEENIE IN HIS EAR.
D.J. IS SUCH A BABE.
WHY IS RUSTY STARING AT ME?
DO I HAVE SOMETHING STUCK IN MY TEETH?
WHAT AM I GETTING AT HERE?
QUALITY-- I'VE GOTTA FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO ABOUT BECKY FALLING IN LOVE WITH ME.
IT'S A GOOD THING I CAN RAMBLE ON FOR HOURS AND HOURS ANDHOURS.
LOOK AT DANNY, BABBLING ON THE OUTSIDE, BURNING WITH PASSION FOR ME ON THE INSIDE.
LOOK AT THESE WEASELS.
ONE CAN'T SHUT UP, AND THE OTHER NEEDS A BIB.
I'LL BE DOING MANKIND A FAVOR WHEN I KILL THEM.
MRS.
KIMMY KATSOPOLIS.
SOUNDS SO GEEKY.
I'LL HAVE HIM TAKE MY NAME.
MR.
JESSE GIBBLER.
I SURE HOPE BECKY AND CINDY DON'T FIGHT OVER ME RIGHT HERE, ALTHOUGH IT COULD BE FUN IF WE BUILT A MUD PIT.
JOEY IS SWEET, BUT I LIKE DANNY.
OH, HE'S SUCH AN ELOQUENT SPEAKER.
* BORING * * BORING * * WHY IS MY DADDY SO BORING ** GEE, I HOPE SOMEBODY DROPS A HAMBURGER.
SO, TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT, LET'S JUST SIT BACK, ALTHOUGH BE CAREFUL, THERE'S NO BACKS ON YOUR CHAIRS-- AND RELAX AND ENJOY SOME FUN QUALITY TIME TOGETHER.
DADDY, CAN I TAKE THIS LOVE LETTER OFF MY HEAD NOW?
MICHELLE, WHERE DID YOU GET THIS LETTER?
DADDY GAVE IT TO ME.
SO YOU SENT THIS LETTER TO REBECCA?
HEY, BECKY GAVE THAT LETTER TO ME.
WHAT?
WAIT A MINUTE!
YOU GAVE ME THIS LETTER FIRST.
JOEY, DON'T JUST SIT THERE.
YOU KNOW YOU WROTE THIS LETTER TO ME.
WHAT LETTER?
THAT'S THE LETTER MY JESSE SENT TO ME.
YEAH-- YOUR JESSE?
I GOT THAT LETTER FROM RUSTY.
HE'S IN LOVE WITH ME.
NO WAY!
I LOVE D.J., AND SHE LOVES ME.
WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE, AND WHERE'S MY REAL FAMILY?
HOLD IT.
H-H-H-H-HOLD IT.
HOLD IT.
EVERYBODY JUST KNOCK IT OFF.
NOW, SOMEBODY WROTE THAT LETTER AND I WANNA KNOW WHO IT IS RIGHT NOW.
I KNOW WHO.
YOU DO?
WHO?
IT WAS RUSTY.
SHE'S LYING!
RUSTY!
OK.
I'M LYING.
I WANTED D.J. TO THINK IT WAS A LOVE LETTER FROM THE PAPER BOY.
YOU LITTLE RAT.
PRETTY FUNNY, HUH?
I'M GLAD YOU ALL CAN TAKE A JOKE.
YOU ALL CAN TAKE A JOKE, CAN'T YOU?
YOU'RE IN BIG TROUBLE, MISTER.
COME HERE, RUSTY.
GET HIM!
RUSTY.
DON'T RUN AWAY FORM ME, YOUNG MAN.
HI.
HI, RICKY.
HERE, I BROUGHT YOUR DAD'S CHANGE.
OH, THANKS.
SO, UH, BARBECUE?

I NEVER SAW IT USED ANYWAY.
GIRLS, GATHER AROUND.
IT'S TIME FOR A LITTLE FAMILY MEETING.
YOU KNOW, WHEN JOEY AND UNCLE JESSE LEFT THIS MORNING TO SHOOT THEIR COMMERCIAL, IT DAWNED ON ME, THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE'LL HAVE A FEW DAYS TOGETHER, THE FOUR OF US.
YOU MEAN THE FIVE OF US.
KIMMY, I CAN COUNT.
THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN SOMEONE HERE HELPING ME OUT, SO THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I GET TO SPEND SOME TIME WITH YOU GIRLS ALL BY MYSELF.
SO HEY, NOBODY MAKE DINNER PLANS, OK?
I'M THERE FOR YOU, DAD.
DAD, DON'T FORGET ABOUT THE SCIENCE FAIR AFTER SCHOOL TOMORROW.
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THAT BIG SURPRISE PROJECT.
I KNOW WHAT IT IS.
MICHELLE.
NO, I DON'T.
BYE, DAD.
BYE-BYE.
OH, DEEJ, I GOT SO WRAPPED UP IN THIS FAMILY TOGETHERNESS, I ALMOST FORGOT.
KATHY SANTONI'S HOME WITH THE STOMACH FLU.
ALL RIGHT!
ALL RIGHT!
GIRLS, IT'S NOT REALLY NICE TO CELEBRATE YOUR FRIENDS' DIGESTIVE DISORDERS.
BUT I'M HER UNDERSTUDY.
THIS MEANS I GET TO BE JULIET IN THE DRAMA FESTIVAL.
ALL RIGHT!
IT'S ON WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON.
YOU'LL BE THERE, RIGHT?
I WOULDN'T MISS IT FOR ANYTHING.
OK, MICHELLE.
ARMS UP.
GREAT.
FIRST I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU TO PRESCHOOL, AND THEN I'M GOING TO GO TO WORK, DO THE MARKETING, CLEAN THE HOUSE, SEND KATHY SANTONI A GET-WELL CARD, AND STILL HAVE TIME TO PUT A HOT DINNER ON THE TABLE.
IMPOSSIBLE, YOU SAY?
FOR THE AVERAGE FATHER, YES.
BUT NOT FOR ME, BECAUSE I AM SUPER DAD.
* SUPER DAD, FLYING OUT THE DOOR * * SUPER DAD, YOU CAN EAT RIGHT OFF MY FLOOR * * SUPER DAD ** WAIT A MINUTE.
TOMORROW IS WEDNESDAY.
HOW CAN DAD BE AT STEPHANIE'S SCIENCE FAIR WHEN IT'S THE SAME DAY AS MY DRAMA FESTIVAL?
HE CAN BE IN TWO PLACES AT ONCE.
HE'S SUPER DAD.
JOSEPH, WE'VE BEEN OUT HERE FOR THREE HOURS.
THE FOX IS NOT COMING OUT.
I HATE IT OUT HERE.
PATIENCE, MY FRIEND.
JUST THINK HOW GREAT OUR COMMERCIAL'S GONNA BE.
WHEN THAT FOX POPS OUT OF HIS HOLE AND ZIPS ACROSS THE FOREST, AS WE HEAR, "FOX FAX MACHINES.
FOR A FAST FAX, FAX WITH A FOX".
FORGET THE FOX.
I'M FREEZING MY FANNY.
HERE.
TAKE MY JACKET.
I'M SWEATING LIKE A HEIFER IN A HOT TUB.
GIVE ME THAT.
HEY, MELLOW OUT, AMIGO.
ANIMALS CAN SENSE BAD VIBES.
OH, YEAH?
SHOOT SOME GOOD VIBES RIGHT IN THE HOLE SO THE FOX WILL COME OUT AND PLAY WITH US.
ALL RIGHT.
I WILL.
ALL RIGHT.
YOO-HOO!
MR.
FOX.
IT'S ME, YOUR NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR, MR.
WOODCHUCK.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME OUT INTO THE FOREST AND FROLIC WITH ME?
THE TREES ARE MADE OF WOOD.
ALL RIGHT.
CUT THE VOICES.
STICK YOUR HAND IN THERE AND YANK THE FOX OUT.
NO WAY.
I KNOW MY CARTOONS.
I PUT MY HAND IN THERE, HE GIVES ME A STICK OF DYNAMITE.
GET OUT OF MY WAY.
ALL RIGHT, YOU FURRY-FACED RODENT, GET YOUR LITTLE FOX BUNS OUT HERE RIGHT NOW!
THEY DON'T LISTEN.
THAT'S IT, JOSEPH.
WE'LL GET THE SHOT AT THE ZOO.
I'M GOING HOME.
HELLO.
NO SUDDEN MOVES.
YOU SCARE THAT SKUNK, HE SPRAYS US, WE DON'T GO ON A DATE FOR A YEAR.
EXCUSE ME ONE MOMENT.
I'M JUST GONNA BE RIGHT OVER HERE.
FEEL FREE TO USE OUR ROLL-ON DEODORANT IF NEEDED.
JOSEPH, DO SOMETHING.
ALL RIGHT.
I, UH, I GOT A PLAN.
I SPEAK SKUNK.
BONJOUR, MONSIEUR SKUNK.
HA HA!
IT IS MOI, PEPE LE PEW.
LOOK, OVER THERE IN THE FOREST, A BEAUTIFUL LADY SKUNK.
RUN TO HER, YOU STINKY STUD.
OOH-LA-LA.
HO HO HO HO.
JOEY, THERE'S THE FOX.
TURN ON THE CAMERA.
NO WAY.
I'M NOT GETTING SKUNKED.
THERE GOES THE SKUNK.
THERE GOES THE FOX.
WHOA!
WHOA!
WHOA!
COME BACK HERE!
GREAT.
NOW WHAT DO WE DO?
WELL, LET'S JUST SIT AND ENJOY THE BEAUTY OF THE FOREST AT NIGHT.
AH, LISTEN.
WILL YOU KNOCK IT OFF?
I HATE THE WOODS.
JESS, YOU JUST HAVE TO OPEN YOURSELF UP TO THE NATURAL BEAUTY THAT SURROUNDS US.
WHAT BEAUTY?
THERE'S NO CENTRAL HEATING, NO PIZZA DELIVERY, NO PLACE TO PLUG IN MY BLOW DRYER.
THERE'S NO PEOPLE HERE.
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY?
BECAUSE AS SOON AS MAN INVENTED CARS, HE DROVE OUT OF HERE.
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO YELL?
YOU YELL AT ME, YOU YELL AT THESE POOR LITTLE CREATURES.
I DON'T TALK TO THEM IN STUPID VOICES.
JOSEPH, I HATE TO BURST THE BUBBLE THAT YOU LIVE IN, BUT VERY FEW OF THESE ANIMALS HAVE WATCHED CARTOONS.
YOU KNOW, YOU ARE REALLY STARTING TO BUM ME OUT.
ARE YOU HAPPY?
I WAS IN A GREAT MOOD, AND YOU JUST RUINED IT.
ACTUALLY, I DO FEEL A LITTLE BETTER, YEAH.
HI, DADDY.
HI, MICHELLE.
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE DADDY'S SPECIAL HELPER AND FINISH SETTING THE TABLE?
IT WOULD BE MY PLEASURE.
THANK YOU.
THE CLOTHES ARE DRY.
OOH, MY FAMOUS TUNA NOODLE CASSEROLE.
I CAN'T WAIT TO SMELL THIS.
I BETTER GET THAT.
IT MIGHT BE THE PHONE.
OK.
COMING.
LIKE YOU CAN HEAR ME.
HELLO.
SUPER DAD.
OH, YEAH.
HI, BECKY.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I REALLY DON'T NEED YOUR HOUSEKEEPER.
NO, THIS SINGLE PARENT STUFF'S A PIECE OF CAKE.
GOT TO GO.
THAT'S MY VEGETABLE MEDLEY.
UH I REALLY GOT TO GO NOW, 'CAUSE MY SHORTS ARE COOKED, AND MY NOODLES ARE DRY, AND-- HELLO.
HELLO.
LET ME GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT.
* SUPER DAD * MICHELLE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
BEING YOUR SPECIAL HELPER.
WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH, BUT WOULD YOU PLEASE PUT THE CONDIMENTS BACK IN THE REFRIGERATOR?
PREFERABLY ARRANGED THE WAY YOU FOUND THEM-- IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER.
ARE YOU TALKING TO ME?
PLEASE PUT EVERYTHING BACK, OK?
HI, DAD.
HI, MR.
T. JULIET, HOW WAS REHEARSAL?
I MUST HAVE DONE THAT KISSING SCENE WITH ROMEO 15 TIMES.
WELL, THAT'S ALL PART OF-- I HAD A LOT OF CATCHING UP TO DO.
YOU'RE COMING LIKE YOU PROMISED, RIGHT?
HEY, I'M GONNA BE RIGHT IN THE FRONT ROW WITH A BUCKET OF COLD WATER.
MICHELLE.
WHY DID YOU CLEAR EVERYTHING OFF OF THE TABLE?
YOU SAID PUT EVERYTHING BACK.
YEAH, WELL, I MEANT THE CONDIMENTS, NOT THE PLATES AND THE SILVERWARE.
THIS IS NOT MY FAULT.
HONEY, I KNOW IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
IT'S MY FAULT, OK?
NOW PLEASE, PUT THE PLATES AND SILVERWARE BACK ON THE TABLE.
ARE YOU SURE THIS TIME?
YES, I'M SURE THIS TIME.
WELL, ALL RIGHT.
LET'S EAT.
I GOT TO PUT THE FINISHING TOUCHES ON MY SCIENCE PROJECT.
GREAT.
IF YOU NEED ANY HELP, SUPER DAD IS HERE FOR YOU.
THANKS, DAD, BUT YOU CAN'T SEE MY PROJECT UNTIL TOMORROW AT THE SCIENCE FAIR.
TOMORROW?
WEDNESDAY.
DEEJ, ISN'T THAT WHEN YOU'RE DOING ROMEO AND JULIET?
BINGO, SUPER DAD.
I AM SO SORRY, GIRLS.
I DIDN'T REALIZE I PROMISED YOU BOTH.
BUT YOU PROMISED ME FIRST.
TELL HER YOU'RE COMING WITH ME, DAD.
NO, TELL HER YOU'RE COMING WITH ME, DAD.
WOW.
THIS WOULD MAKE A GREAT GAME SHOW, MR T-- WHO DO YOU LOVE MORE?
KIMMY, LET'S SEE WHAT'S BEHIND DOOR NUMBER 1.
WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT?
IT'S THE EXIT.
THANK YOU FOR PLAYING OUR GAME.
DAD, YOU SAID YOU WOULDN'T MISS ME PLAYING JULIET FOR ANYTHING.
I KNOW I SAID THAT, HONEY, BUT I-- YOU'RE NOT COMING TO MY SCIENCE FAIR?
HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME?
GOOD CHOICE, DAD.
I DIDN'T CHOOSE YOU.
BUT YOU PROMISED ME.
I KNOW I PROMISED.
OH, FINE, BREAK A PROMISE.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO WITH STEPHANIE?
DEEJ.
I SET THE TABLE AGAIN.
HONEY, WE'RE NOT EATING RIGHT NOW.
HE'S DRIVING ME BANANAS.
GIRLS, LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS.
STEPHANIE, I'M SICK OF YOU WRECKING MY LIFE.
I'M SLEEPING IN UNCLE JESSE'S ROOM.
FINE!
FINE!
FINE!
MICHELLE, WHAT ARE YOU MAD ABOUT?
I'M NOT MAD.
I LIKE THIS GAME.
FINE!
OK, NOW WE'VE GOT TWO EVENTS AND ONE PARENT.
THAT'S WHAT I CALL A DILEMMA, AND YOU KNOW MY MOTTO-- WHEN LIFE GIVES YOU DILEMMAS, YOU MAKE DILEMONADE.
DAD, YOU'RE STALLING.
OK, BEFORE I TELL YOU MY DECISION, YOU BOTH UNDERSTAND THAT I LOVE ALL MY GIRLS EXACTLY THE SAME.
YOU KNOW THAT, DON'T YOU?
OK, GOOD.
D.J., I'M SORRY I CANNOT GO TO YOUR PLAY.
YES!
I PROMISED I'D GO TO YOUR SCIENCE FAIR BEFORE I KNEW ABOUT D.J.'s PLAY.
OH, GREAT.
SO THAT'S IT?
YOU'RE NOT COMING?
HONEY, I PROMISE, NEXT TIME YOU'RE IN A PLAY, I'LL SEE IT TWICE, OK?
LET'S JUST BE TOGETHER AND HAVE A NICE DINNER.
I MADE MY FABULOUS TUNA NOODLE CASSEROLE AND SOME ABSOLUTELY GLORIOUS STEAMED VEGETABLES.
MMM.
AHA.
AAH!
THIS WAS MY SCIENCE PROJECT.
YOU MADE A SIDE DISH FOR A SCIENCE PROJECT?
IT WAS A BRAIN, AND YOU BOILED IT.
STEPH, I-- I'M SO SORRY.
I THOUGH UNCLE JESSE LEFT IT FOR US FOR DINNER.
THIS IS A REAL TRAGEDY.
SPEAKING OF TRAGEDIES, ROMEO AND JULIET IS ONE OF THE BEST.
WELL, I GUESS DAD CAN GO SEE IT NOW.
I'M HUNGRY.
CAN I HAVE SOME BRAIN, PLEASE?
MR.
BIRD.
MR.
SQUIRREL, HOW ARE YOU?
AH, JOSEPH, THIS IS SO BEAUTIFUL OUT HERE.
I SAW THE MOST AMAZING SUNRISE.
THE SUN WAS COMING UP OVER THE LAKE.
I COULD SEE THE REFLECTION OF THE TREES, THE MOUNTAINS, AND-- I'M TALKING TO A PAIR OF BOOTS.
JOEY.
JOSEPH, WAKE UP.
WAKE UP.
OH, MAN, I DIDN'T SLEEP A WINK.
AN ARMY OF ANTS TURNED ME INTO AN ALL-NIGHT SALAD BAR.
MELLOW OUT, AMIGO.
SMELL THE FRESH AIR.
ENJOY THE VIRGIN FOREST.
HECK, HUG A TREE.
DID YOU HAVE A CLOSE ENCOUNTER WITH A WOOD FAIRY?
I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID.
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
I NEVER REALIZED HOW BEAUTIFUL NATURE REALLY IS.
IT PUTS ME IN SUCH A GREAT MOOD.
HERE, JOE, HERE.
DO A VOICE.
MAKE MR.
WOODCHUCK DO A VOICE.
COME ON, DO MR.
TWIG.
HELLO.
I'M MR.
TWIG.
HOW'D HE TALK?
TWIGS DO NOT TALK.
AND WHY NOT?
BECAUSE IN THE WORDS OF MR.
WOODCHUCK, THEY'RE MADE OF WOOD.
HUH?
HUH?
I GOT IT DOWN.
I WAS PRACTICING.
YEAH.
WELL, THEY DO LOOK PRETTY APPETIZING.
THANKS FOR CHEERING ME UP.
I WAS A CRAB.
I WAS CRABBY, TOO.
I'M SORRY.
THIS IS GREAT.
WANT TO GO TAKE A HIKE?
I'LL GRAB SOME GRANOLA BARS AND TOILET PAPER, AND WE'RE OUT OF HERE.
GOOD.
* UNTIL WE MEET AGAIN * * HAPPY TRAILS TO YOU * * KEEP SMILING UNTIL THEN * TAKE IT, JOE.
* WHO CARES ABOUT THE CLOUDS * * WHEN WE'RE TOGETHER?
* * JUST SING A SONG * * AND BRING THE SUNNY WEATHER * * HAPPY TRAILS TO YOU * * TILL ME MEET AGAIN * * HAPPY TRAILS TO YOU * * UNTIL WE MEET AGAIN * * GET THE CAMERA, JOSEPH * * AND FILM OUR FURRY FRIEND * * WHO CARES ABOUT THE CLOUDS * * WHEN WE'RE TOGETHER?
* * JUST SING A SONG * * AND BRING THE SUNNY WEATHER * * HAPPY TRAILS TO YOU * * TILL ME MEET AGAIN ** HARK, O FATHER.
MY FIRST SCENE BEGINETH AT 3:15.
BE THOU NOT LATE.
I'LL BE-ETH THERE.
WHAT'S THAT THING DOING BACK?
I THOUGHT WE ATE IT.
MY BRAIN.
IT'S ALIVE.
AND UNCOOKED.
I STAYED UP ALL NIGHT FINISHING IT.
THIS MEANS YOU CAN COME TO MY SCIENCE FAIR.
THIS WORKED OUT GREAT.
YEAH.
IT WORKED OUT GREAT FOR YOU.
AND FOR YOU.
I FIGURED THE WHOLE THING OUT.
STEPH, IF I GO TO YOUR SCIENCE FAIR AND LEAVE AT EXACTLY 4:18, DEEJ, I'LL BE IN TIME TO SEE YOUR SECOND SCENE.
PERFECT SOLUTION, HUH, GIRLS?
BUT IN THE SECOND SCENE, JULIET'S DEAD.
TOO BAD YOU CAN'T SEE ME WHEN I'M ALIVE.
BYE, DAD.
BYE.
AND YOU'RE GONNA MISS THE JUDGING, WHICH IS PRETTY MUCH THE REASON FOR GOING.
BYE, DAD.
BYE, HONEY.
LET'S PLAY HORSEY.
YOU BE THE HORSE.
HONEY, DADDY IS REALLY TIRED.
OK.
I'LL BE THE HORSE.
OK.
DADDY'S GOT A BETTER IDEA, MISS ED.
SINCE WE'VE GOT AN HOUR BEFORE THE SCIENCE FAIR AND THE PLAY, WHY DON'T YOU LIE DOWN AND TAKE A NAP?
I DON'T WANT TO TAKE A NAP.
DADDY DOESN'T REALLY CARE.
DADDY HAD A HARD DAY AT WORK.
DADDY WAS UP ALL NIGHT PERFORMING THIRD GRADE BRAIN SURGERY.
DADDY SAYS YOU'RE TAKING A NAP.
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT-- I'LL EVEN REST WITH YOU FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES, OK?
AHH.
DADDY?
* ROCK-A-BYE, DADDY, ON THE TREE TOP * * WHEN THE WIND BLOWS, THE CRADLE WILL ROCK ** GOOD NIGHT.
DAD!
I'M HOME WITH MY PRIZE-WINNING BRAIN THAT YOU DIDN'T SHOW UP TO SEE!
DAD?
OK, YOU LITTLE KISS-UP, HOW DID YOU CONVINCE DAD TO MISS MY ROMEO AND JULIET?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
HE MISSED MY SCIENCE FAIR.
THEN WHERE IS HE?
I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST GOT HOME.
WELL, DAD WOULDN'T JUST NOT SHOW UP.
DO YOU THINK SOMETHING HAPPENED TO HIM?
DAD!
DAD!
DAD!
DAD!
DAD!
DAD!
DAD!
DAD!
DAD!
BE QUIET!
DADDY IS SLEEPING.
DAD, I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE OK.
WE WERE SO WORRIED ABOUT YOU.
I'M FINE.
I SLEPT THROUGH EVERYTHING.
IT'S OK.
WE'RE JUST GLAD NOTHING HAPPENED TO YOU.
GIRLS, I AM SO SORRY.
I WANTED TO BE THERE SO BADLY, AND I LET YOU BOTH DOWN.
THIS SINGLE PARENT STUFF IS NOT AS EASY AS I THOUGHT.
WE DIDN'T MAKE IT ANY EASIER FOR YOU.
I'M SORRY I WAS SO SELFISH TODAY.
I'M SORRY, TOO.
I'M SORRY, TOO.
MICHELLE, YOU HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS.
I DIDN'T WANT TO BE LEFT OUT.
OH, COME HERE, HONEY.
YOU GIRLS ARE THE GREATEST.
I MUST BE THE LUCKIEST DAD IN THE WHOLE WORLD.
YOU'RE THE GREATEST DAD IN THE WHOLE WORLD.
OH, SHUCKS.
SO WHAT DID THE GREATEST DAD IN THE WORLD SLEEP THROUGH TODAY?
WELL, THE PLAY WAS GREAT, BUT ROMEO GOT THE HICCUPS, SO WE HAD TO CUT THE KISSING SCENE SHORT.
GEE, WHAT A SHAME.
HOW ABOUT YOU, SWEETIE?
MY BRAIN WON A SPECIAL PRIZE-- MOST BIODEGRADABLE.
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, I'M GONNA GO GET DINNER STARTED.
DAD, WAIT.
YOU DO SO MUCH FOR US.
LET US COOK DINNER FOR YOU.
GREAT IDEA.
COME ON, MICHELLE.
YOU CAN BE OUR SPECIAL HELPER.
OK, BUT I'M NOT SETTING THAT TABLE, MISTER.

A HAIRY WORM.
WELL, I THINK THAT HAIRY WORM IS CALLED A CATERPILLAR.
MR.
CATERPILLAR IS AN UGLY BUG.
WELL, PRETTY SOON HE'S GOING TO TURN INTO A BEAUTIFUL BUTTERFLY.
NO WAY, JOSE.
IT'S TRUE, MAGOO.
IT'S LIKE IN THE FAIRY TALES.

HI, MELINDA.
IT'S JOEY.
JOEY GLADSTONE.
YEAH, WE WENT OUT ABOUT 10 MONTHS AGO.
YEAH.
MAYBE THIS WILL HELP YOU.
HY-GA-GA-GA-WHOA!
YEAH.
YEAH.
SO HOW THE HECK ARE YOU?
MARRIED.
WELL, THEN YOU PROBABLY HAVE A DATE FOR NEW YEAR'S EVE.
BYE.
OH, BOY.
I COULD'VE THROWN THAT ONE OVERBOARD.
HEY!
HEY, YOU GUYS.
HOW WAS THE BIG DOUBLE DATE?
OH, IT WAS GREAT.
WE ENDED UP AT HAPPY MOUNTAIN AMUSEMENT PARK.
YEAH, IT WAS SO ROMANTIC.
WE WENT TO THE "TEST YOUR STRENGTH" BOOTH, AND WITH ONE SWING OF THE HAMMER JESSE RANG THE BELL AND WON ME THIS CUTE TEDDY GORILLA.
AND THEN CINDY STEPPED UP AND WON THIS FOR ME.
MY HERO.
SO, JOE, ARE WE GONNA TRIPLE DATE ON NEW YEAR'S EVE, HUH?
DID YOU FIND THE LUCKY GIRL YET?
NOT YET, BUT I STILL GOT "T" THROUGH "Z".
WELL, YOU CAN'T MISS THE BIG PARTY DOWN AT THE STATION.
WHY, IS DANNY GOING TO BE BABY NEW YEAR AGAIN?
NOT AFTER THAT WICKED DIAPER RASH I GOT LAST YEAR.
QUIT YAKKING.
HIT THE PHONES.
COME ON, WE NEED YOU TO GO TO THE PARTY.
IT'S NO PARTY WITHOUT YOU.
LET'S GO.
IT'S RINGING.
HI.
IS MARY TRABULOUS THERE?
OH, NOW IT'S SISTER MARY?
OH, WELL.
YOU GOT A DATE FOR NEW YEAR'S EVE?
HANG ON.
YOU GUYS WANT TO SKIP THE PARTY AND GO TO MASS?
D.J.: GO AHEAD, COMET.
GIVE IT A TRY.
YEAH!
HOW DOES HE DO THAT?
I DON'T KNOW.
LET'S TRY IT.
GREAT.
I'M JUST IN TIME FOR STUPID TANNER TRICKS.
KIMMY, HERE'S A GOOD NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTION FOR YOU.
MOVE TO COSTA RICA.
JUST OR THAT, YOU'RE NOT INVITED TO MY NEW YEAR'S EVE PARTY.
WHOA, KIMMY.
YOUR PARENTS ARE GONNA LET YOU HAVE THAT PARTY?
YEP.
THEY SAID I COULD HAVE IT AS LONG AS IT WAS LIMITED TO A SMALL INTIMATE GATHERING OF MY CLOSEST PERSONAL FRIENDS, WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT I PUT ON THE FLYERS.
SEE YOU THERE.
"CUTE BOYS ADMITTED FREE".
GOOD IDEA.
NOT SO FAST, PARTY GIRL.
DID WE FORGET WHO'S SPENDING NEW YEAR'S EVE BABYSITTING ME AND MICHELLE?
NO.
YES.
NO.
SHE SAID YES.
WHO NEEDS A PARTY FULL OF CUTE BOYS WHEN YOU CAN RING IN THE NEW YEAR WITH YOUR SWEET, ADORABLE SISTERS?
DAD!
DAD!
DAD!
HI.
THIS IS JOEY GLADSTONE.
IS BARBARA ZOREK THERE?
OH, HI, MRS.
ZOREK.
BARBARA MOVED TO ALASKA?
WELL, UH, MRS.
ZOREK IT'S ESTELLE, RIGHT?
YEAH.
ARE YOU BUSY NEW YEAR'S EVE?
OH, WELL.
MAYBE NEXT YEAR.
YEAH.
GOOD-BYE.
DAD!
DAD!
DAD!
DAD!
DAD!
DAD!
YEAH.
YEAH, WHAT'S THE MATTER?
KIMMY'S HAVING A BIG NEW YEAR'S EVE PARTY, AND I KNOW I PROMISED TO BABY-SIT MICHELLE AND STEPHANIE, BUT JUST FOR ONE NIGHT, CAN'T WE PUT THEM IN A KENNEL OR SOMETHING?
THAT IS A TERRIBLE THING TO SAY ABOUT YOUR SISTERS.
BESIDES, KENNELS ARE VERY EXPENSIVE.
DON'T WORRY, DEEJ.
I HAVE NO LIFE.
I'LL BABY-SIT YOUR SISTERS.
OH, JOEY, I LOVE YOU!
THANK YOU FOR HAVING NO LIFE.
HEY, MY PLEASURE.
HEY, JOE, DID YOU GET A DATE YET?
YEP.
I GOT TWO OF 'EM.
GIRLS, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE ONE HAPPY NEW YEAR'S EVE.
ALL RIGHT!
ALL RIGHT!
WHAT IS NEW YEAR'S EVE?
NEW YEAR'S EVE IS THE FUNNEST PARTY OF THE YEAR.
YOU GET TO STAY UP LATE AND SCREAM, "HAPPY NEW YEAR"!
HAPPY NEW YEAR!
HAPPY NEW YEAR!
HAPPY NEW YEAR!
MICHELLE, IT'S NOT NEW YEAR'S EVE YET.
I KNOW THAT, SILLY, BUT I'M JUST PRACTICING.
HAPPY NEW YEAR!
HAPPY NEW YEAR!
HAPPY NEW YEAR!
JOEY, I HATE IT THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO THIS PARTY WITH US.
WHAT'S THE POINT?
THE CLOCK WILL STRIKE MIDNIGHT, YOU'LL KISS YOUR GIRLFRIEND, YOU'LL KISS YOUR FIANCEE, AND I'LL GO INTO THIS PATHETIC BIT.
I THINK I DATED HER ONCE.
JOEY, YOU'RE JUST IN A LITTLE SLUMP.
THINGS WILL TURN AROUND.
YEAH, BUT WHEN?
ALL I WANT TO DO IS MARRY THE GIRL OF MY DREAMS, HAVE A COUPLE OF KIDS OF MY OWN, AND ALWAYS KNOW THAT I HAVE A DATE EVERY NEW YEAR'S EVE.
DANIEL, WE GOT TO GET THAT BOY A WOMAN.
JESSE, JOEY IS NEVER GOING TO AGREE TO MAKE A TAPE FOR A VIDEO DATING SERVICE.
THAT'S WHY WE DON'T TELL HIM, SEE?
I GOT A PLAN.
WHAT WE DO IS SECRETLY HIDE THE CAMERA LIKE SO, GET HIM UP HERE, PUT HIM IN THAT CHAIR, AND MAKE HIM STAY THERE.
YOU FEEL GOOD ABOUT ALL THIS UNDERHANDED TRICKERY?
YES.
JUST CHECKING.
HERE WE GO.
JOEY, GET UP HERE IN THE ATTIC.
JESSE AND I NEED TO TALK TO YOU, AND IT'S AN EMERGENCY.
WHAT KIND OF EMERGENCY?
NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS!
JUST GET UP HERE!
ALL RIGHT, THE CHAIR'S SET.
ALL RIGHT.
TAPE'S ROLLING.
AND ACTION.
HI.
I'M DANNY TANNER.
AND I'M JESSE KATSOPOLIS.
LADIES, YOU HAVE SEEN THE REST, AND NOW YOU'RE GOING TO MEET THE BEST-- JOEY GLADSTONE.
RIGHT, NOW, JOEY WOULD NEVER JOIN ONE OF THESE VIDEO DATING SERVICES BECAUSE HE WOULDN'T WANT TO LOOK DESPERATE.
NOT THAT YOU GIRLS LOOK DESPERATE.
I'M SURE YOU JOINED UP FOR OTHER REASONS, NONE OF THEM HAVING TO DO ANYTHING WITH DESPERATION.
CAN YOU HELP ME OUT HERE PLEASE?
YOU BET I CAN.
WHO IS JOEY GLADSTONE?
WELL, IF I WAS A WOMAN-- THAT'S A BIG IF, BY THE WAY-- I'D SAY THAT JOEY IS A MAJOR HUNK OF BEEF.
GUYS, ARE YOU UP THERE?
ALL RIGHT.
HERE HE COMES.
REMEMBER, HE DOESN'T KNOW WE'RE TAPING THIS, SO YOU'RE GONNA SEE THE REAL JOSEPH GLADSTONE.
YOU GUYS OK?
ARE WE OK?
ISN'T THAT JUST LIKE JOEY GLADSTONE TO THINK OF OTHER PEOPLE FIRST?
SO WHAT'S THE BIG EMERGENCY?
UH, WE GOT A NEW CHAIR.
WE HAVE A NEW CHAIR, AND WE NEED YOU TO TEST IT OUT FOR US.
HERE, SIT DOWN THERE.
THERE WE GO.
YOU DRAGGED ME OUT OF THE SHOWER FOR THIS?
JOEY, I DON'T MAKE A MOVE WITHOUT YOU.
I MEAN, AFTER ALL, YOU DO OWN HALF THIS PRODUCTION COMPANY.
YOU'RE A VERY SUCCESSFUL STAND-UP COMIC, YOU ENJOY HOCKEY, THE THREE STOOGES, AND LONG WALKS ALONG THE BEACH.
AND UNDERNEATH ALL THIS SHAVING CREAM IS A HANDSOME AND MANLY FACE.
YES, WITH SOME VERY NICE HAIR, I MIGHT ADD.
DANNY, I CAN SHAVE MYSELF.
HE CAN SHAVE HIMSELF.
IS THERE NO LIMIT TO THIS MAN'S TALENTS?
WHY DO YOU GUYS KEEP TALKING TO THAT EASEL?
TALKING TO AN EASEL.
AND WHAT A SENSE OF HUMOR.
AND HEY DOESN'T HE CLEAN UP NICE?
YOU GUYS ARE REALLY SCARING ME, SO I'M JUST GOING TO LEAVE NOW.
IF YOU TRY AND CHASE ME, I'M GOING TO SCREAM LIKE A GIRL.
OH, HO, HO.
ISN'T HE SPECIAL?
JOEY GLADSTONE.
CALL NOW.
OPERATORS ARE STANDING BY.
JOE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
MAKING CONFETTI FOR MY BIG NEW YEAR'S EVE PARTY WITH STEPHANIE AND MICHELLE.
IT IS GOING TO BE WILD.
JOEY, REMEMBER THE OTHER DAY WHEN WE HAD YOU TEST THAT NEW CHAIR?
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SHAVE ME AGAIN, ARE YOU?
AH, WE DID A GREAT THING.
SEE, WE SECRETLY PUT YOU ON TAPE, AND WE ENROLLED YOU IN A VIDEO DATING SERVICE.
HOW DARE YOU SUBJECT ME TO THAT KIND OF PUBLIC HUMILIATION WITHOUT MY PERSONAL CONSENT.
I HAVE A TAPE HERE FULL OF WOMEN WHO WANT TO MEET YOU.
GOD BLESS YOU FELLAS.
ROLL THAT TAPE.
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOUR DATES RIGHT HERE ON THE LOVE CONNECTION.
ALL RIGHT.
HERE WE GO.
HI.
I'M DARLENE.
I'M SINGLE, A NONSMOKER.
I LOVE WATERSPORTS.
I'M 2,420 YEARS OLD AND HAIL FROM THE PLANET ZORON.
UH, LET'S MOVE AHEAD AND SEE IF ANY EARTHLINGS LIKED MY TAPE.
HI.
I'M GINGER.
MY PAROLE OFFICER SAYS I NEED TO MAKE NEW FRIENDS.
THIS GIRL DOESN'T KNOW WHERE I LIVE, DOES SHE?
LOOK, I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU GUYS ARE TRYING TO DO FOR ME, BUT THIS IS ALL JUST A BIG WASTE OF TIME.
HI.
I'M CHRISTINE.
MY FRIENDS SIGNED ME UP FOR THIS FOR CHRISTMAS.
I REALLY WANTED AN ELECTRIC FOOT MASSAGER, BUT MAYBE I'LL FIND SOMEBODY NICE WHO'LL RUB MY FEET.
IF NOT, I'LL FIND SOME USE FOR THIS TAPE.
HAPPY NEW YEAR, MOM.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER?
NOTHING.
SHE'S GREAT.
I'M CALLING HER.
JOEY!
JOEY!
JOEY!
JOEY!
JOEY!
JOEY!
JOEY!
JOEY!
JOEY!
JOEY!
HELLO.
CHRISTINE?
JOEY GLADSTONE.
YEAH, THE CHAIR TESTER.
HEY, LISTEN, I KNOW IT'S NEW YEAR'S EVE, BUT YOU'RE NOT BUSY?
THAT'S GREAT!
WAIT.
WAIT.
I'M BUSY.
I COULD MAKE US DINNER.
WE COULD HANG OUT HERE.
GREAT!
OKAY, I'LL CALL YOU BACK WITH ALL THE DETAILS.
BYE, CHRISTINE.
ALL RIGHT, JOSEPH!
YOU GOT YOURSELF A DATE FOR NEW YEAR'S EVE.
THIS IS NOT JUST A DATE.
MY SEARCH IS OVER.
I HAVE FINALLY FOUND THE GIRL OF MY DREAMS.
HUH?
DON'T WE MAKE A GREAT COUPLE?
YOU GUYS, I THINK I'M IN LOVE.
I'M GOING TO KIMMY'S PARTY, DAD.
SEE YOU NEXT YEAR.
HAPPY NEW YEAR, HONEY.
NOW, DON'T FORGET YOUR CURFEW IS 11:30.
DAD, IT'S NEW YEAR'S EVE.
SORRY.
12:05.
DAD, DON'T BE SUCH A DAD.
IT'S GOING TO BE A QUIET LITTLE PARTY AT KIMMY'S.
YEAH, RIGHT.
THAT'S WHY I FOUND THIS FLYER ON MY WINDSHIELD AT THE MARKET.
OH, LET'S COMPROMISE.
I'LL BE HOME AT 4:00 IN THE MORNING?
DEAL.
BYE.
BYE.
HAVE A GOOD TIME, HONEY.
SEE YOU LATER.
NOW, RUSTY, REMEMBER, YOU'RE GOING TO BE ON YOUR BEST BEHAVIOR.
NO WATER BALLOONS, NO FOOD FIGHTS, AND NO INDOOR CAMPFIRES.
THEN WHAT'S THE FUN OF STAYING HERE?
HEY, CAN'T I COME WITH YOU GUYS TO THE PARTY?
AW, RUSTY, NOT IN A MILLION YEARS.
COME ON, LET ME GET YOUR WRAP.
HAPPY NEW YEAR!
HAPPY NEW YEAR!
MICHELLE, I KEEP TELLING YOU, WAIT UNTIL 12:00.
GIVE ME A BREAK.
I CAN'T TELL TIME.
HEY, STEPH, GUESS WHAT HAPPENS AT MIDNIGHT.
YOU GET A NEW YEAR'S KISS.
EWW, GROSS.
I'D RATHER KISS A FROG.
RIBBIT.
RIBBIT.
RIBBIT.
RIBBIT.
RIBBIT.
HAPPY NEW YEAR!
HAPPY NEW YEAR!
HAPPY NEW YEAR!
IT'S NOT YET.
IT'S NOT YET.
HI, GUYS.
HEY.
HOPE I DIDN'T HOLD YOU UP.
JUST WANTED TO GET THE PERFECT DINNER FOR MY PERFECT GIRL-- CHRISTINE I DON'T KNOW HER LAST NAME YET.
JOEY, LISTEN.
I'M GLAD THAT YOU'RE EXCITED ABOUT YOUR DATE, BUT I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE DISAPPOINTED IF THERE'S NOT BELLS GOING OFF AND FIREWORKS.
I MEAN, THE ODDS OF LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT ARE PRETTY SLIM, PAL.
JOEY?
CHRISTINE?
HI.
HI.
THEN AGAIN, WHAT THE HELL DO I KNOW?
LAST WEEK, WHEN I WAS ROLLERBLADING-- WAIT A SEC.
YOU ROLLERBLADE?
OH, I LOVE IT.
I LOVE IT!
GET OUT OF HERE!
GET OUT OF HERE!
DO YOU REMEMBER THE OLD BULLWINKLE SHOW?
NOT ROCKY AND FRIENDS, BUT THE REAL BULLWINKLE SHOW?
YEAH, YEAH.
AND NOW FOR SOMETHING WE HOPE YOU REALLY LIKE.
NOTHING UP MY SLEEVE.
PRESTO!
THIS IS SO AMAZING.
TWO TOTAL STRANGERS, FORCED TO JOIN A VIDEO DATING SERVICE AGAINST THEIR WILL, DISCOVER THAT THEY SHARE THE EXACT SAME INTERESTS.
I'LL BET YOU DO STAND-UP COMEDY, DON'T YOU?
ACTUALLY, I'M A VETERINARIAN AT THE ZOO.
SO AM I!
NO, YOU'RE NOT!
I KNOW.
WE WERE JUST ON SUCH A ROLL THERE, I KIND OF HATED TO SEE IT END.
THAT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL.
I MEAN, THAT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL.
ONLY THREE MORE MINUTES TO GO, YOU GUYS.
OH, MICHELLE, ARE YOU SLEEPING?
HUH?
HAPPY NEW YEAR.
HAPPY NEW YEAR.
NO.
IT'S STILL NOT TIME YET.
THIS IS TAKING FOREVER.
HI, EVERYONE.
YOU ALL KNOW RICKY.
DEEJ, WHAT HAPPENED WITH YOUR PARTY?
WELL, KIMMY'S DAD FREAKED OUT AND SENT EVERYONE HOME.
YEAH, JUST 'CAUSE A FEW EXTRA GUESTS SHOWED UP.
HOW MANY EXTRA GUESTS?
THE POLICE ESTIMATED 400.
THE GIBBLERS ARE VERY HAPPY.
YAH-HEY, EVERYBODY!
YAH-HEY!
YAH-HEY!
WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON OUT THERE?
I ESTIMATE THERE'S GOOD ESTIMATE.
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING HERE?
WE WANTED TO RING IN THE NEW YEAR WITH OUR FAMILY, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE WE REALLY LOVE.
LIKE OUR PAPERBOY.
HI, RICKY.
HEY, DUDE.
I'M WEARING THE HAT.
WHERE'S THE PARTY?
IT'S ALMOST TIME.
EVERYBODY GET YOUR CONFETTI AND NOISEMAKERS READY.

HAPPY NEW YEAR!
HAPPY NEW YEAR!
WELCOME TO A BRAND-NEW YEAR.
HAPPY NEW YEAR, SAN FRANCISCO, THE UNITED STATES, THE WORLD IN GENERAL, AND THE UNIVERSE.
READY FOR MY KISS.
ARE YOU CRAZY?
YOU REALLY THINK I WOULD KISS YOU?
I JUST LOVE TORTURING YOU.
WELL, IN THAT CASE, HAPPY NEW YEAR.
WHOA!
MOMMY!
WHOA, STEPHANIE.
WHERE'D YOU LEARN THAT?
OH.
OK, YOU TWO, WHY DON'T YOU JUST SHAKE HANDS AND SAY GOOD NIGHT?
MICHELLE, THAT'S IT.
TIME FOR BED, HONEY.
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE PARTY?
I'M SORRY, HONEY.
NEW YEAR'S IS OVER.
WHERE'S THE CAKE?
WHERE'S THE PRESENTS?
SWEETHEART, THERE ARE NO CAKE OR PRESENTS ON NEW YEAR'S.
I STAYED UP ALL NIGHT TO KISS A DOG?
THIS IS NUTS.
YEAH, BUT TOMORROW'S NEW YEAR'S DAY.
WE GET TO WATCH DON'T WAKE ME UP.
I'LL SEE YOU ON MY BIRTHDAY.
YOU KNOW, SO FAR, YEAR OF MY LIFE.
I KNOW.
I NEVER WANT THIS NIGHT TO END.
ME NEITHER.
WE GOT TO KEEP THE MAGIC GOING.
ANY IDEAS?
YEAH, I GOT ONE.
LET'S GET MARRIED.
"LET'S GET MARRIED"?
WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER ONE NIGHT, YOU WANT TO GET MARRIED?
YEAH.
WHY NOT?
OK, I'M IN.
LET'S DO IT.
REALLY?
YES.
THIS IS CRAZY.
WE'LL DRIVE TO TAHOE TONIGHT.
THAT'S EVEN CRAZIER.
I'LL GO HOME AND PACK.
CRAZY!
CRAZY!
CHRISTINE.
YES?
I REALLY LIKE YOU.
I REALLY LIKE YOU, TOO.
I'LL BE BACK.
YOU'LL BE BACK.
DID YOU HAVE A GOOD NEW YEAR'S, HONEY?
IT WAS GREAT, SWEETHEART.
NOT YOU.
GREAT NEWS, YOU GUYS.
CHRISTINE AND I ARE GOING TO TAHOE TONIGHT, AND WE'RE GETTING MARRIED!
HELLO.
I SAID I'M MARRYING CHRISTINE.
IS THIS THING ON?
MIKE TEST.
1, 2.
JOEY, I'M ABOUT TO DO THIS TO YOU BECAUSE I LOVE YOU LIKE A BROTHER.
ARE YOU CRAZY?
GET A GRIP!
SNAP OUT OF IT!
HEY, I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.
JOEY, NO, YOU DON'T.
LOOK, I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN A TAD LONELY LATELY, BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO MARRY THE FIRST WOMAN THAT WALKS BY IN A PARTY HAT.
YEAH, BUT I REALLY LIKE HER.
HERE, LET ME TALK TO HIM.
JOEY, MARRIAGE IS A COMMITMENT YOU GOT TO MAKE FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.
THERE'S NO ESCAPE.
I MEAN, YOU'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT THE SAME WOMAN'S FACE DAY AFTER DAY, WHICH COULD BE A BEAUTIFUL THING.
I THOUGHT YOU AND DANNY SET THIS WHOLE THING UP SO I COULD MEET THE GIRL OF MY DREAMS.
YEAH, THAT'S TRUE, BUT GET TO KNOW HER, JOEY.
TAKE HER OUT IN PUBLIC.
SEE WHAT SHE LOOKS LIKE IN DAYLIGHT.
I DON'T GET IT.
WHY AREN'T YOU GUYS HAPPY FOR ME?
WE ARE HAPPY FOR YOU.
WE'RE JUST A LITTLE SHOCKED AND OVERWHELMED AND DISTRAUGHT, BUT IN A HAPPY WAY.
JOEY, IF YOU WANT TO DO IT, I SAY GO FOR IT.
WELL, THEN I'M GOING.
WELL, THEN CONGRATULATIONS.
YEAH.
YOU'RE REALLY-- YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED TO, UH, CHRISTINE, ISN'T IT?
I ALWAYS KNEW YOU TWO WERE MEANT FOR EACH OTHER.
I'M GETTING MARRIED.
YEAH.
YEAH.
I'M GETTING MARRIED.
I'M GETTING MARRIED?
WHAT THE HECK DO I KNOW ABOUT THIS GIRL?
JOEY?
WELL, I KNOW SHE'S A FAST PACKER.
CHRISTINE, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU, TOO.
LET ME GO FIRST.
I HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE EXCITED TO MEET SOMEONE.
I FEEL THE SAME WAY.
THAT'S GREAT.
I JUST THINK WE SHOULD POSTPONE THE WEDDING UNTIL WE KNOW EACH OTHER A LITTLE BETTER.
AT LEAST TILL AFTER OUR SECOND DATE.
JOEY, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I CAME BACK HERE TO TELL YOU.
OH, GOOD.
BOY, I REALLY DID GET CARRIED AWAY THERE.
I THINK IT'S BECAUSE I'VE NEVER HAD SO MUCH FUN ON A DATE BEFORE.
ME, NEITHER.
SO WHAT'LL WE DO TOMORROW?
LET'S ROLLERBLADE.
I WAS GONNA SAY THAT.
GET OUT OF HERE.
GET OUT OF HERE.
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE SO MUCH FUN.
I WANT TO KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU, STARTING WITH, UH WHAT'S YOUR LAST NAME?
McCALL.
McCALL?

HEY, STEPH.
WE JUST GOT BACK FROM PRESCHOOL, AND YOUR SISTER MICHELLE HAS SOMETHING TO SHOW YOU.
WANT TO SEE WHAT I GOT?
SURE, WHY NOT?
YOU HAVE TO SAY PLEASE.
I'M NOT THAT INTERESTED.
STEPH, JUST PLAY ALONG.
IT'S POLITENESS WEEK IN PRESCHOOL.
I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET OFFICER MICHELLE OF THE POLITE POLICE.
I'LL BE WATCHING YOU, MISTER.
STEPHANIE HAVE A VERY NICE DAY.
HI.
HEY.
DAD, BOY, I MISSED YOU.
HOW'S THE GREATEST DAD IN THE HISTORY OF DADS FEELING TODAY?
VERY SUSPICIOUS.
COMPLIMENT HIM ON HIS SHOE, SOCK, PANT COMBINATION.
DADS LOVE THAT.
DAD, SIT DOWN.
MAKE YOURSELF COMFORTABLE.
CAREFUL, DAD.
SHE NEEDS MONEY AND LOTS OF IT.
HOW DO YOU KNOW?
DEEJ, WE GO BACK EIGHT YEARS.
WE ALL KNOW WHEN IT'S KISS-UP TIME.
ALL RIGHT.
HOW MUCH?
WELL, YOU HAVE TO KNOW THAT THIS MONEY'S NOT FOR ANYTHING FUN.
IT'S FOR CLOTHES-- A BASIC NECESSITY OF LIFE.
HOW MUCH?
WELL, BEFORE I TELL YOU THE ACTUAL DOLLAR AMOUNT, YOU HAVE TO KNOW THAT THESE ARE THE WORLD'S COOLEST TENNIS SHOES.
HOW MUCH?
ONLY $80 PER SHOE.
WHY ARE WE LAUGHING?
'CAUSE FOR A SECOND THERE I THOUGHT YOU ACTUALLY ASKED ME FOR $160 FOR SNEAKERS.
I DID.
BUT THESE AREN'T JUST SNEAKERS.
THESE ARE BLOW-OUTS.
BLOW-OUTS ARE SO RAD.
THEY ACTUALLY INHALE AND EXHALE AS YOU WALK.
AND IF I DON'T GET THESE, I'M GONNA BE A TOTAL GEEK.
YOU KNOW HOW THAT FEELS, MR.
T. TAKES ONE TO KNOW ONE.
DEEJ, YOU DON'T ALWAYS HAVE TO FOLLOW THE CROWD.
WHEN I WAS A BOY AND EVERYBODY WAS WASTING THEIR ALLOWANCE ON THOSE EVEL KNIEVEL JUMPSUITS, I WENT OUT AND I BOUGHT SOME SENSIBLE SANSABELT PANTS WITH AN ADJUSTABLE WAISTBAND, A STYLE STILL WORN TODAY BY SOME OF AMERICA'S FINEST BOWLERS.
TIME FOR PLAN "B".
DAD, WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT IF I NEVER HAD TO WEASEL MONEY OUT OF YOU AGAIN?
I LIKE PLAN "B" SO FAR.
I CAN EARN MY OWN MONEY BY GETTING A JOB.
THERE'S A PHOTOGRAPHER DOWN AT THE MALL, AND HE SAID THAT I COULD BE HIS PART-TIME ASSISTANT.
DEEJ, WHAT ABOUT YOUR SCHOOLWORK?
YOUR GRADE IN SCIENCE HAS BEEN SLIPPING LATELY.
I GIVE YOU MY PERSONAL GUARANTEE THAT D.J. WILL RAISE HER GRADE IN SCIENCE.
OH, THE GIBBLER GUARANTEE.
OH, WELL, THAT CHANGES EVERYTHING.
HEY, DAD, COME ON.
I'M 14 YEARS OLD.
I'M READY FOR ADULT RESPONSIBILITIES.
ALL RIGHT, LOOK.
IF YOU CAN KEEP YOUR GRADES UP, YOU CAN TAKE THE JOB.
OH, THANKS, DAD.
YEAH, THANKS, MR.
T. WHY ARE YOU SO HAPPY?
D.J.'s GETTING BLOW-OUTS, AND WE HAVE THE SAME SIZE FEET.
HI, SWEETHEART.
BEAUTIFUL.
LISTEN, MY FOLKS CALLED TODAY, AND THEY HAVE THIS WACKY IDEA THAT SINCE WE'RE ENGAGED, WE SHOULD ACTUALLY SET A DATE AND PLACE FOR THE WEDDING.
WELL, JUST SAY THE MAGIC WORD-- GRACELAND.
HONEY, I KNOW IT'S YOUR DREAM TO GET MARRIED IN THAT CRUSHED-VELVET AMUSEMENT PARK, BUT CONSIDER ALL THE BENEFITS OF A WEDDING BACK IN MY HOMETOWN, VALENTINE, NEBRASKA.
NAME ONE.
IT'S NOT GRACELAND.
OH, COME ON.
YOU'VE NEVER EVEN SEEN GRACELAND.
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
YOU'RE 27-YEARS-OLD JESS, JESS!
WHAT?
QUICK, CAN I BORROW YOUR CREDIT CARD?
I'M WAY OVER MY LIMIT, AND THE SHOPPING NETWORK IS OFFERING A SPECIAL ON THE BARNEY RUBBLE BATH COLLECTION.
NO WAY.
YOU STILL HAVEN'T PAID ME FOR THAT CALIFORNIA RAISIN CHESS SET.
JOEY, I'LL BUY YOU THE RUBBLE BUBBLE BATH.
YOU WILL?
YES, BUT YOU HAVE TO SELL JESSE ON THE IDEA OF A WEDDING IN NEBRASKA.
OK.
HOW WOULD I SELL NEBRASKA?
WUH, WUH.
WUH, YOU TWO KIDS GETTING MARRIED?
WUH, CONSIDER NEBRASKA, A DOWNRIGHT FRIENDLY PLACE WITH DOWNRIGHT FRIENDLY FOLKS WHERE THE CORN IS AS HIGH AS AN ELEPHANT'S EYE AND DAGNABIT, THE SKY'S NOT CLOUDY ALL DAY.
YOU PICTURE IT, JESS, MY BOY.
JUST PICTURE IT.
PICTURE IT.
HEY, GOAT.
YOU SEE MY FIANCEE AROUND HERE?
JESSE!
TIME TO GET HITCHED, FARM BOY.
BECK, YOU GOT ME DRESSED UP LIKE A BEVERLY HILLBILLY.
YOU LOOK CUTER THAN A HOUND DOG IN A HAIR NET.
READY OR NOT, HERE I COME.
HI, BABY.
HAVE MERCY.
PLANT A BIG WET ONE ON ME, JETHRO.
NO WAY.
I'M NOT GETTING MARRIED ON HEE-HAW.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
JUST CHECKING.
JOSEPH, EXPLAIN TO MY FIANCEE THE VIRTUES OF A CLASSY, ELEGANT WEDDING AT GRACELAND, WON'T YOU?
OK.
CLASSY AND ELEGANT.
IMAGINE YOURSELF AT GRACELAND THE LUXURIOUS, PALATIAL ESTATE OF THE LATE, GREAT KING OF ROCK AND ROLL, ELVIS PRESLEY, WHERE EVERY CORNER OOZES ROMANCE-- FROM THE GOLD-PLATED RACQUETBALL COURTS TO THE NEWLY ASTROTURFED JUNGLE ROOM.
WORTH OVER PICTURE IT, PICTURE IT, PICTURE IT!
WHERE ARE YOU, DARLING?
COME OUT HERE, BABY.
LET ME SEE YOU.
OH, YEAH.
YOU LOOK LIKE A HUNK-A, HUNK-A BURNING BRIDE, BABY.
JESS, ARE YOU SURE YOU LIKE MY HAIR LIKE THIS?
I CAN BARELY HOLD MY HEAD UP.
OH, YOU LOOK PRETTIER THAN A FRIED PEANUT BUTTER AND 'NANA SANDWICH, PRISCILLA.
JESS, MY NAME IS REBECCA.
SORRY, 'CILLA.
WISE MAN SAY ONLY FOOLS RUSH IN, BUT I CAN'T HELP FALLING IN LOVE WITH YOU, BABY.
SOMETHING DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT ABOUT THIS WEDDING.
YEAH, YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT, PRISCILLA.
THAT BEEHIVE AIN'T HIGH ENOUGH.
LET'S JACK THAT BABY UP A LITTLE BIT.
IT'S GOT TO BE FIT FOR A KING.
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING, BABY?
I THINK YOU DO.
LET'S GET A FEW THINGS STRAIGHT.
MY NAME IS REBECCA, AND I AM NOT GETTING MARRIED WITH A HAIRDO LIKE MARGE SIMPSON!
MARGE SIMPSON?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
OKAY, COME ON, YOU GUYS.
HEY.
COME ON, THAT'S ENOUGH.
LISTEN, YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED REAL SOON, SO YOU BETTER LEARN TO COMPROMISE.
NOW, CALL ME TOTALLY NUTTY, BUT WHAT ABOUT HAVING A WEDDING RIGHT HERE WHERE YOU LIVE, IN SAN FRANCISCO?
WELL, THE KID'S GOT SOMETHING THERE.
I MEAN, THIS IS WHERE WE MET AND THIS IS WHERE WE FELL IN LOVE.
YEAH, THIS IS WHERE ALL OUR FRIENDS ARE.
LET'S DO IT.
ALL RIGHT, AND LET'S GET MARRIED ON THE MOST ROMANTIC DAY OF THE YEAR.
AW, PERFECT.
ELVIS' BIRTHDAY.
NO.
VALENTINE'S DAY.
AW, I LOVE IT.
JOEY, THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR HELP.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
NOW, WOULD SOMEBODY PLEASE GIVE ME A CREDIT CARD.
IF I CALL NOW, THEY'LL THROW IN A FREE BAM-BAM SOAP-ON-A-ROPE.
UH, THANKS, FRED.
HA HA HA HA HA.
I FEEL SO AT PEACE NOW THAT WE FINALLY MADE THIS DECISION.
YEAH.
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE GETTING MARRIED IN SIX WEEKS.
AAH!
SIX WEEKS!
WE HAVE A MILLION THINGS TO DO.
FIND A CHURCH, HIRE A HALL, BUY A DRESS, PICK OUT INVITATIONS, A BAND, A CATERER, COCKTAIL NAPKINS-- BECKY, WHY DON'T WE ELOPE?
OH, I DON'T KNOW.
THEN WE'D NEED A BALCONY, A LADDER, A GETAWAY CAR, A FLASHLIGHT COME ON, ANTHONY, SMILE FOR MOMMY, PLEASE.
PRETTY PLEASE WITH NINJA TURTLES ON TOP?
JUST LEAVE THIS TO US PROFESSIONALS.
OH, HAPPY HELPER?
HERE I AM, HAPPY TO HELP.
GREAT.
GO GET ANTHONY TO GIVE US A BIG TOT-SHOT SMILE.
HI, ANTHONY.
I'M D.J., THE HAPPY HELPER.
NOW, WHY DON'T YOU GIVE ME A BIG, HAPPY SMILE FOR YOUR PICTURE.
NO!
THAT'S NOT FUNNY.
I KNOW WHAT YOU NEED.
IT'S HOWIE THE HIPPO.
LOOK AT HOW HE CAN ZIPPO, HOW HE CAN FLIPPO.
I REALLY FEEL LIKE A DIPPO.
THAT'S NOT FUNNY.
COME ON.
I'VE HAD A ROUGH WEEK.
NOW, WHAT CAN I DO TO MAKE YOU LAUGH?
BE A DUCK.
QUACK!
QUACK!
QUACK!
QUACK!
QUACK!
OH, WHAT A BEAUTIFUL CHILD.
IS THAT GONNA BE CASH OR CHARGE?
CHECK.
OH, HAPPY HELPER.
KIMMY, DO YOU REALLY HAVE TO COME BY EVERY DAY AND LAUGH AT ME?
I'M NOT LAUGHING AT YOU, I'M LAUGHING WITH YOU.
ONLY YOU'RE NOT JOINING IN.
COME ON, TAKE A BREAK.
THOSE CUTE GUYS WANT TO BUY US PIZZA.
I DON'T WANT ANYONE CUTE SEEING ME LIKE THIS.
WHAT ABOUT AFTER WORK?
I HAVE TO GO HOME, EAT DINNER, AND THEN TRY AND STAY AWAKE LONG ENOUGH TO STUDY FOR MY SCIENCE TEST.
POOR KID.
YOU'RE WORKING LIKE A DOG AND DRESSING LIKE A DWEEB.
YOU MUST REALLY WANT THOSE BLOW-OUTS BAD.
IT'S MORE THAN SHOES.
I'M TRYING TO BE A RESPONSIBLE ADULT.
THEN IF I WERE YOU, I'D LOSE THE CLOWN SUIT.
COME ON, BOYS.
COMET, IT'S NOT POLITE TO BEG.
NOW, SAY PLEASE.
VERY GOOD, COMET.
HEY, YOU FORGOT TO SAY THANK YOU.
GOOD AFTERNOON, LADIES.
GOOD AFTERNOON, MICHELLE.
IS DAD HOME YET?
NO, BUT THANK YOU FOR ASKING.
WELL, AT LEAST I'LL STAY OUT OF TROUBLE FOR A FEW MORE MINUTES.
D.J., YOU DON'T HAVE TO SHOW YOUR DAD THAT SCIENCE TEST.
YES, I DO.
I PROMISED HIM THAT I'D RAISE MY GRADE, AND HE KNOWS I'M GETTING MY TEST BACK TODAY.
SO WHEN HE SEES THIS I'M DEAD.
THE FIRST "F" OF MY LIFE.
EXCUSE ME, BUT NO ELBOWS ON THE TABLE.
WHEN MY DAD FINDS OUT ABOUT THIS "F," HE GOING TO MAKE ME QUIT MY JOB.
YOU KNOW, NOW THAT I LOOK AT IT, I DON'T THINK YOU GOT AN "F".
I BELIEVE THAT YOU GOT AN "A".
KIMMY, HOW COULD YOU DO THAT?
IT'S NOT POLITE TO YELL.
MICHELLE, I HAVE ENOUGH PROBLEMS WITHOUT THE POLITE POLICE ON MY TAIL.
SO JUST STAY OUT OF THIS.
YOU FORGOT TO SAY PLEASE.
THAT'S IT!
THIS IS NOT POLITE.
THIS IS NOT POLITE.
THIS IS NOT POLITE.
THIS IS NOT POLITE.
THANK YOU.
YOU ARE NOT WELCOME.
I HAVE TO GO TO WORK.
YOU KNOW, KIMMY, YOU REALLY MESSED ME UP BY GIVING ME THAT "A".
NOW I CAN'T SHOW IT TO MY DAD.
WHY NOT?
IT'S A PERFECT FORGERY.
KIMMY, DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?
WHAT YOU DID IS WRONG.
IT'S DISHONEST, IT'S DECEITFUL, IT REALLY DOES LOOK LIKE AN "A".
QUACK!
QUACK!
QUACK!
QUACK!
QUACK!
QUACK!
QUACK!
QUACK!
QUACK!
QUACK!
SMILE, D.J. OH, GREAT.
MORE HUMILIATION.
EXCUSE ME.
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING HERE?
WELL, WE WERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD, AND I HAD MY CAMERA, AND I THOUGHT WE'D JUST STOP BY AND SAY HI.
HI.
HI.
WELL, THANKS FOR STOPPING BY.
DO YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A MOP ON YOUR HEAD?
YES.
IT'S PART OF MY UNIFORM.
CAN I BORROW YOUR UNIFORM NEXT HALLOWEEN?
WELL, I SHOULD GET BACK TO WORK.
WELL, BEFORE WE GO, IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN-- AND I'M NOT-- WASN'T YOUR SCIENCE TEST DUE BACK TODAY?
HOW'D YOU DO?
I REALLY SHOULD GET BACK TO WORK.
AW, COME ON, DEEJ.
TELL ME HOW YOU DID.
DID YOU BRING YOUR TEST PAPER WITH YOU?
YEAH.
I'LL SHOW YOU, BUT THERE'S SOMETHING I SHOULD REALLY TELL YOU.
YOU GOT AN "A"?
WAY TO GO!
THIS IS GOING RIGHT UP THERE ON THE REFRIGERATOR.
DAD, THIS ISN'T-- YOU KNOW, SWEETIE, I'M A LITTLE EMBARRASSED TO TELL YOU THIS, BUT I HAD MY DOUBTS ABOUT YOU, BUT YOU JUST PROVED TO ME THAT YOU CAN HOLD DOWN A JOB AND ACTUALLY IMPROVE ON YOUR SCHOOLWORK.
I'VE NEVER BEEN SO PROUD OF YOU, SWEETHEART.
NOW, WHAT WAS IT YOU WANTED TO TELL ME?
UH, THERE'S A SALE ON SPONGES DOWN AT BROOM BARN.
OH, WHAT BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN.
CAN I HELP YOU PEOPLE?
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BELIEVE THIS.
WE HAD NO INTENTION OF HAVING ANY PICTURES TAKEN, BUT YOUR BRIGHT YOUNG ASSISTANT HERE CONVINCED ME TO GET SOME SHOTS OF MY SWEET LITTLE MICHELLE OVER THERE.
WHAT A FINE, FINE SALESPERSON YOU HAVE IN THIS YOUNG LADY.
OK, HAPPY HELPER, START HAPPY HELPING.
OK, LITTLE GIRL, YOU'RE GOING TO GET YOUR PICTURE TAKEN.
I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, THAT BRIGHT YOUNG LADY IN THE CLOWN COSTUME, SHE IS FABULOUS.
YOU OUGHT TO GIVE HER A RAISE.
WHAT THE HECK DO I KNOW?
I'VE NEVER SEEN HER BEFORE IN MY LIFE.
SAY CHEESE.
YOU MEAN, SAY CHEESE, PLEASE.
SAY CHEESE, PLEASE.
CHEESE.
THIS IS AMAZING.
MY SWEET LITTLE MICHELLE HAS NEVER SMILED IN HER ENTIRE LIFE.
CHEESE.
CHEESE.
MAY I HAVE THAT CUPCAKE PLEASE?
NO, YOU MAY NOT.
BUT I WAS POLITE, AND I SAID, "PLEASE".
I WAS POLITE, TOO.
I SAID, "NO, YOU MAY NOT".
GUESS WHAT.
POLITENESS WEEK IS OVER!
HOW RUDE!
WHOA.
WHOA.
WHOA.
HEY, DEEJ.
HI, UNCLE JESSE.
SEE YOU GOT AN "A" HERE ON YOUR SCIENCE.
IT WAS NOTHING.
LET'S HEAR WHAT AN "A" PAPER SOUNDS LIKE, SHALL WE?
"PHOTOSYNTHESIS.
"PHOTOSYNTHESIS IS THE PROCESS IN WHICH PHOTOS ARE SYNTHESIZED".
HMM, I WONDER WHAT AN "F" PAPER LOOKS LIKE.
ACTUALLY, MAYBE IT LOOKS SOMETHING LIKE THIS.
HOW DID YOU KNOW?
PFF, HOW DID I KNOW?
YOU'RE TALKING TO A GUY WHO USED TO CHANGE 40s TO 90s, IN FACT-- THIS IS BEAUTIFUL.
ONE TIME I ACTUALLY GOT AWAY WITH CHANGING THE WORD "AWFUL" TO "AWESOME".
THE POINT IS IT WAS WRONG, IT WAS WRONG.
THE POINT IS IT WAS WRONG, AND WHAT YOU DID WAS WRONG TOO.
SAME THING.
WRONG.
I KNOW, BUT KIMMY WAS THE ONE WHO CHANGED THE GRADE.
YES, BUT YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT, NOW, DID YOU.
SO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO WITH THIS PAPER, DON'T YOU.
KEEP MY MOUTH SHUT AND DO BETTER NEXT TIME?
WHERE'S DAD?
IN THE LIVING ROOM ROTATING COUCH CUSHIONS.
HI, DAD.
HEY, DEEJ.
HERE'S A HELPFUL HINT.
ALWAYS ROTATE YOUR COUCH CUSHIONS EVERY 25,000 SITS.
DAD, WE NEED TO TALK.
YOU KNOW WHAT I LIKE ABOUT YOU BEST?
MY CHARM?
MY RUGGED GOOD LOOKS?
YOUR FORGIVING NATURE.
WHAT DID YOU DO?
HERE GOES.
MY SCIENCE GRADE WAS AN "F," AND KIMMY CHANGED IT TO AN "A".
I'M JUST GUESSING SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DO THIS.
DAD, I'M SORRY.
BUT WITH WORK AND ALL MY OTHER CLASSES, I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO STUDY FOR MY SCIENCE TEST.
THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE COME TO ME AND TOLD ME WHAT WAS GOING ON.
D.J. WE HAD AN UNDERSTANDING.
YOU WANTED TO BE A RESPONSIBLE ADULT, AND THIS IS THE LEAST RESPONSIBLE THING YOU COULD HAVE DONE.
I JUST WANTED TO PROVE THAT I COULD EARN MY OWN MONEY.
WELL, THAT'S ALL OUT THE WINDOW NOW BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO QUIT YOUR JOB AND NO HANGING OUT AT THE MALL UNTIL YOU PULL UP THAT GRADE.
OK.
GUESS I'LL GO BACK TO BEING A KID AGAIN.
DEEJ, THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH BEING A KID.
YOU SHOULD ENJOY IT.
YOU GOT THE REST OF YOUR LIFE TO BE AN ADULT.
WELL, I GUESS IF BEING AN ADULT MEANS WEARING A RED MOP ON MY HEAD, I COULD HANDLE BEING A KID A LITTLE LONGER.
IN CASE I FORGOT TO MENTION IT, YOU'RE A PRETTY GREAT KID.
THANKS, DAD.
WELL, I GUESS THIS IS MY FIRST AND LAST PAYCHECK.
YOU GONNA USE IT TO HELP PAY FOR THOSE BLOW-OUTS?
ARE YOU KIDDING?
PAY $160 FOR SHOES?
DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH QUACKING AND WADDLING I HAD TO DO TO EARN THIS MONEY?
IT'S GOING IN THE BANK.
THAT'S GOOD NEWS.
SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE LEARNING THE VALUE OF A DOLLAR.
I AM, AND I APPRECIATE HOW YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL WHEN I ASK YOU THIS.
DAD, CAN I HAVE A RAISE IN MY ALLOWANCE?
YOU KNOW, HONEY?
BACK TO THOSE COUCH CUSHIONS.
THINGS ARE REALLY EXPENSIVE THESE DAYS, YOU KNOW?

YOU'RE GETTING COLDER.
YOU'RE A POPSICLE.
YOU'RE A POPSICLE AT THE NORTH POLE.
MICHELLE, THE COLDER YOU GET, THE FURTHER YOU ARE FROM THE THING YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.
I KNOW HOW TO PLAY.
I JUST WANT A COOKIE.
NOW, WHERE WERE WE?
ALL RIGHT, JOEY, I GOTTA REHEARSE WITH THE BAND.
CAN YOU TAKE BECKY'S WEDDING RING DOWN AND HAVE IT ENGRAVED FOR ME?
NO PROBLEM.
ALL RIGHT, GOOD.

LIKE A RIVER FLOWS SURELY TO THE SEA" JESS, JUST SO YOU KNOW, THEY CHARGE BY THE LETTER.
ALL RIGHT, JUST MAKE IT "LOVE ME TENDER".
HEY, GUYS.
HI, JOEY.
HI, SWEETHEART.
HI, BECK.
JESS, ARE YOU READY FOR A LITTLE NO-WHINING TUXEDO SHOPPING?
OHH.
I TOLD YOU ALREADY, I FOUND THE PERFECT TUXEDO.
AND I TOLD YOU ALREADY THAT I'M NOT MARRYING A MAN WEARING A LEATHER TUXEDO WITH A COBRA ON THE BACK.
HEY, GREAT NEWS, EVERYONE.
OUR SCHOOL FUND RAISER TONIGHT IS COMPLETELY SOLD OUT.
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.
ALL MY FRIENDS ARE SO PSYCHED.
WE'RE GONNA BE IN A REAL ROCK CLUB INSTEAD OF A SWEATY GYM.
THE SMASH CLUB IS ALL YOURS.
YOU JUST GOTTA GET EVERYONE OUT OF THERE BY 9:00 BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO BRING IN THE MUD WRESTLING PIT.
THEY GOT RID OF THE JELL-O?
DEEJ, COME HERE.
I GOTTA TELL YOU HOW PROUD OF YOU I AM FOR PUTTING TOGETHER THIS FUND RAISER FOR YOUR SCHOOL NEWSPAPER.
SEEMS LIKE ONLY YESTERDAY I WAS POWDERING YOUR LITTLE TUSHY.
DAD, PLEASE.
SORRY, SWEETIE.
DAD, PLEASE DON'T PICK MY LINT.
SORRY AGAIN.
NOW, JOEY, YOU'RE GOING TO OPEN THE SHOW BY DOING YOUR COMEDY ACT.
DEEJ, I HAVE TOTALLY ADAPTED MY VEGAS ACT TO THE JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL CROWD.
SO, THIS SEVENTH GRADER COMES UP TO ME AND SAYS, "HEY, DUDE, GOT ANY MOUSSE"?
AND I SAY,  "WHY, CERTAINLY, IS BULLWINKLE OK"?
SO, WHEN I WAS IN JUNIOR HIGH, I WATCHED LOTS OF CARTOONS.
DID YOU EVER NOTICE THAT CARTOON CHARACTERS COULD PRETTY MUCH GET A HOLD OF DYNAMITE WHENEVER THEY NEEDED IT?
AND IT WASN'T THE TYPE OF DYNAMITE THAT WOULD KILL YOU.
IT JUST KINDA MADE YOUR REAR END SMOLDER.
JOEY, THAT'S GREAT.
MY FRIENDS THINK YOU'RE HILARIOUS.
NOW UNCLE JESSE, YOUR BAND'S GONNA DO A WHOLE SET, RIGHT?
YEAH, WE'RE GONNA RIP IT UP, TEAR IT APART, PARTY TILL THE PARENTS COME AND PICK YOU UP.
THANKS, YOU GUYS.
THIS IS SO COOL.
OH, AND DAD, WHEN YOU'RE UP THERE INTRODUCING JESSE AND JOEY-- YEAH, DEEJ?
KEEP IT SHORT.
WE WANT TO TRY AND PACK IN AS MUCH ENTERTAINMENT AS POSSIBLE.
I'LL TRY NOT TO GET IN THE WAY OF ALL THE FUN.
THANKS, DAD.
OH, AND PLEASE, DON'T MENTION MY TUSHY IN PUBLIC.
I'M GOING OVER TO KIMMY'S.
SEE YOU, DEEJ.
BYE.
BYE, D.J. OH, MAN.
I'M GETTING A VIBE HERE THAT D.J. DOESN'T THINK I'M ALL THAT GROOVY.
NO.
NO.
NO.
IT'S A REAL MIND BLOWER.
I JUST WISH I COULD SHOW D.J. THAT I'M AS HIP AND COOL AS YOU GUYS ARE.
DANNY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE HIP AND COOL.
YOU'RE SPIC AND SPAN.
NO, I'M SERIOUS.
I WANT D.J. TO BE PROUD OF ME.
I GOT AN IDEA.
I AM GOING TO SURPRISE D.J. JESS, I'M GOING TO SING A SONG WITH YOU AND YOUR BAND.
COULDN'T YOU JUST SURPRISE HER WITH, LIKE, A REALLY NICE SWEATER?
YOU DON'T THINK I CAN BE COOL?
JUST WAIT TILL YOU SEE HOW I GET DOWN AND GET FUNKY WITH MY BAD SELF.
HOOYAH!
WHO WANTS TO PLAY HOT AND COLD?
OHH.
OHH.
OHH.
I HEARD THAT.
I'LL PLAY WITH YOU LATER.
I GOT TO WORK ON MY ACT.
YEAH, I GOTTA GO RIP THE COBRA OFF THE BACK OF JESSE'S TUX.
I GOT TO STOP HER.
I GOTTA GET DOWN AND GET FUNKY.
THEY'LL WANT TO FIND THIS.
HA HA HA!
GOOD BOY, COMET.
YOU'RE SUCH A SMART DOG.
UP ON THE BED.
YOU CAN HELP ME WITH MY HOMEWORK.
THANKS, COMET.
STEPH, PLEASE TELL ME YOU KNOW WHERE JESSE'S WEDDING RING IS.
I WOULD IF I COULD, BUT I CAN'T.
I'M SUPPOSED TO TAKE IT TO THE ENGRAVER, AND I CAN'T FIND IT.
JESSE'S GONNA KILL ME.
OOH, I CAN JUST SEE THAT VEIN IN HIS FOREHEAD THROBBING, HIS NECK TURNING RED, HIS EYES BUGGING OUT!
CAN I BE THERE WHEN YOU TELL HIM YOU LOST IT?
WHO WANTS TO PLAY HOT AND COLD?
NOT NOW, MICHELLE.
I HAVE TO FIND JESSE'S WEDDING RING.
YOU'RE VERY COLD.
YOU TOOK JESSE'S WEDDING RING?
YOU'RE GETTING WARMER.
ALL RIGHT, GUYS, I KNOW IT'S A DRAG HAVING TO PLAY A JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL FUND RAISER.
BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS YOU'RE NOT GETTING PAID EITHER.
OH, THANKS.
ALL RIGHT, LET'S ROCK AND ROLL!
DANNY, JUST LIE DOWN AND DON'T GET UP UNTIL THE FEVER BREAKS.
JESS, I GOTTA TELL YOU, MAN, I KNOW WHY YOU ROCKERS WIGGLE AROUND ON THE STAGE SO MUCH.
THESE LEATHER PANTS REALLY RIDE UP.
YOU KNOW, DANNY, A LOT OF GUYS CAN'T PULL OFF THIS LOOK, AND THERE'S AN OUTSIDE CHANCE THAT YOU JUST MAY BE ONE OF THEM.
COME ON, JESS.
LET'S REHEARSE MY SONG BEFORE D.J. GETS HOME.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU, UH YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?
JESS IT'S ALWAYS BEEN MY SECRET DREAM TO BE A REAL ROCK STAR.
YOU KNOW I NEVER TOLD YOU THIS, BUT, UH I USED TO SING WITH THE PARTRIDGE FAMILY.
YOU DID?
YEAH, 'TIL MY MOM MADE MY SHUT IT OFF AND DO MY HOMEWORK.
JESSE, I'M GOING TO SING A SONG THAT IS ULTRA HIP AND MEGA COOL.
MY GENERATION BY THE WHO.
WELL, MY GENERATION WAS ULTRA HIP AND MEGA COOL IN THE SIXTIES, BUT THESE KIDS WON'T KNOW THAT SONG.
HEY, MY GENERATION IS A TIMELESS ANTHEM OF TEENAGE ANGST AND REBELLION.
BUT I'M NOT GONNA SING IT LIKE SOME OLD ROCK 'N' ROLL DINOSAUR.
I SPENT AN HOUR WATCHING DOWNTOWN JULIE BROWN ON MTV.
I AM READY TO BUST A MOVE.
ALL RIGHT, LET'S PUMP UP THE JAM.
HUH?
LET'S JUST PLAY THE SONG, HUH?
GENERATION IN "G".
* YO, PEOPLE TRY TO PUT US D-D-DOWN * * TALKIN' ABOUT MY GENERATION * * JUST BECAUSE WE G-G-GET AROUND * * TALKIN' ABOUT MY GENERATION * * THINGS THEY DO LOOK AWFUL COLD * * TALKIN' ABOUT MY GENERATION * * HOPE I DIE BEFORE I GET OLD * * TALKIN' ABOUT MY GENERATION * * MY GENERATION * * CAN'T TOUCH IT, CAN'T TOUCH IT * * MY GENERATION, BABY * * WHY DON'T YOU ALL * * FADE AWAY * * TALKIN' ABOUT MY GENERATION * * DON'T TRY AND DIG WHAT WE ALL S-S-SAY * * TALKIN' ABOUT MY GENERATION * * I'M NOT TRYIN' TO CAUSE A NEW S-S-SENSATION * * TALKIN' ABOUT MY GENERATION * * I'M JUST TALKIN' ABOUT MY G-G-GENERATION * * TALKIN' ABOUT MY GENERATION * * MY GENERATION * * MY GENERATION, BABY *  DAD, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
OH, I'M, UH, I'M BUSTING A MOVE.
AND MY SHOULDER.
OOH.
GIVE ME THAT.
HONEY, I WANTED TO SURPRISE YOU.
I'M GOING TO SING THIS AT YOUR FUND RAISER.
YOU WERE GOING TO DO THAT IN PUBLIC?
ALL MY FRIENDS WILL BE THERE.
YOU MEAN YOUR FORMER FRIENDS.
YOUR DAD HAS A VERY GOOD VOICE.
YOU JUST NEED TO TIE HIM DOWN TO A CHAIR, THAT'S ALL.
DAD, YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME.
I'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO SHOW MY FACE IN SCHOOL AGAIN.
I THINK MY SINGING MUST HAVE REALLY EMBARRASSED D.J. DON'T FORGET THE CLOTHES AND THE DANCING.
KIMMY, DON'T HELP.
OK.
I'LL GO HELP D.J. SWEEP UP THE SHATTERED PIECES OF HER LIFE.
JESS, COULD I SEE YOU IN THE KITCHEN, PLEASE?
SURE.
OH, GUYS DON'T GET TOO ATTACHED TO MY GENERATION.
YOU ALL RIGHT?
OH, JESS, WHO AM I TRYING TO KID?
THIS ISN'T THE REAL ME.
THIS ISN'T THE REAL ME EITHER.
WHOA, I DON'T WANT TO SEE THE REAL YOU!
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT SINGING THAT SONG WOULD SHOW D.J. THAT I COULD BE COOL.
OH, DON'T FEEL BAD.
WHEN YOU'RE 14, YOUR DAD'S NEVER COOL.
YOU KNOW, THAT'S TRUE.
I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS A KID, I WAS PLAYING FOOTBALL WITH ALL MY FRIENDS.
MY DAD CAME OUT.
GUESS HE WANTED TO PROVE HE WAS ONE OF THE GUYS.
HE THREW ME A PASS.
ALL I COULD REMEMBER THINKING WAS, "OH, NO.
MY DAD THROWS LIKE A GIRL"!
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU'RE A TEENAGER, THINGS SEEM SO MUCH WORSE THAN THEY REALLY ARE, YOU KNOW?
NO, MY DAD REALLY THREW LIKE A GIRL.
THE PASS ONLY MADE IT ABOUT HALFWAY.
HAD TO TELL MY FRIENDS HE HURT HIS ARM IN THE WAR.
SO NOW YOU KNOW HOW D.J. FEELS.
I MEAN, COULD YOU IMAGINE IF YOUR DAD THREW THAT SISSY THROW IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE SCHOOL?
YEAH, BUT WHAT I'M DOING ISN'T NEARLY AS BAD AS WHAT HE DID TO ME.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT'S WORSE.
AT LEAST MY DAD NEVER WORE A GRINNING SKULL.
D.J., HOW CAN YOU NOT GO TONIGHT?
YOU PUT TOGETHER THE WHOLE FUNDRAISER.
HEY, IF ANYONE WONDERS WHY I'M NOT THERE, THEY'LL STOP WONDERING AS SOON AS THEY HEAR MY DAD SING.
D.J., CAN I TALK TO YOU A MINUTE, ALONE?
OH, IT'S OK, MR.
T. ANYTHING YOU COULD SAY TO D.J., YOU CAN SAY IN FRONT OF ME.
OK.
D.J., HOW CAN WE GET KIMMY OUT OF THE ROOM?
IN MY HOUSE.
THAT'S OK.
YOU'VE GOT ENOUGH PROBLEMS.
DEEJ ABOUT ME SINGING TONIGHT, I UNDERSTAND EXACTLY HOW YOU FEEL.
MY DAD THREW LIKE A GIRL.
WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE GRANDPA HURT HIS ARM IN THE WAR.
BOY, I TOLD EVERYBODY THAT STORY, DIDN'T I?
THE POINT IS, YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY.
I'M NOT GOING TO SING TONIGHT.
REALLY?
YOU MEAN IT?
I PROMISE, NOT ONE MOVE WILL I BUST.
THANKS, DAD.
YOU KNOW, THIS MAY SOUND A LITTLE SILLY, BUT I JUST WANTED YOU TO THINK I WAS HIP AND COOL.
BUT I'M NOT, SO DON'T WORRY, I WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING TO EMBARRASS YOU, OK?
DAD, I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU WERE GOING TO DO.
BUT I APPRECIATE EVEN MORE THAT YOU'RE NOT GONNA DO IT.
HEY, IT'S MY PLEASURE.
I'M HAPPY 'CAUSE NOW I CAN GET OUT OF THESE LEATHER PANTS AND INTO SOME OINTMENT.
OW!
KIMMY, AREN'T YOU EMBARRASSED TO HAVE A GLASS AT YOUR EAR?
WELL, IF YOU'D SPEAK A LITTLE LOUDER, I COULD HEAR WITHOUT IT.
OH, AND ON BEHALF OF VANADDA JUNIOR HIGH, THANKS FOR NOT SINGING.
ALL RIGHT, DEEJ!
YOU DON'T HAVE TO CHANGE SCHOOLS!
YEAH, GREAT.
I FEEL SO GUILTY ABOUT HURTING MY DAD'S FEELINGS.
IT COULD BE WORSE.
REALLY?
HOW?
* TALKIN' ABOUT MY G-G-GENERATION * * YO, PEOPLE TRY TO GET US DOWN * * TALKIN' ABOUT MY GENERATION * OK, HOW AM I DOING, MICHELLE?
YOU'RE GETTING WARMER.
YOU'RE GETTING HOTTER.
YOU'RE A HOT DOG!
YOU FOUND THE RING!
YIPPEE!
MICHELLE, THIS IS NOT QUITE THE RING I WAS LOOKING FOR.
ARE YOU GOING TO EAT THAT?
MICHELLE, WOULD YOU FORGET ABOUT THE COOKIE.
WHEN I SEE A COOKIE, I CAN'T FORGET ABOUT IT.
WELL, I'LL GIVE YOU THE COOKIE IF YOU TELL ME WHERE THE RING IS.
I TOLD YOU I PUT IT IN THE COOKIE JAR.
AND I SAID IT'S NOT IN THE COOKIE JAR.
THEN HOW DO I GET THAT COOKIE?
I'LL TELL YOU HOW YOU GET THE COOKIE, BY REMEMBERING WHERE YOU PUT THE RING.
NOW THINK.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT?
YES, I DO.
THAT COOKIE.
WELL, STOP THINKING ABOUT IT.
NOW, HOW ABOUT IF YOU SHOW ME EVERYTHING YOU DID FROM THE TIME YOU PICKED UP UNCLE JESSE'S RING, AND I'LL FOLLOW YOU?
YOU MEAN LIKE FOLLOW THE LEADER?
RIGHT.
NOW, WHAT DID YOU DO AFTER YOU PICKED UP THE RING?
I CAME INTO THE KITCHEN.
GOOD.
NOW WE'RE GETTING SOMEWHERE.
OK.
THEN WHAT HAPPENED?
I SAW A BUG.
OK.
THEN WHAT?
I FOLLOWED THE BUG.
OK, WHERE DID YOU FOLLOW THE BUG?
FOLLOW THE LEADER.
OK, FOLLOW THE LEADER.
OK.
THEN WHAT?
THEN THE BUG STOPPED.
OK, THEN WHAT HAPPENED?
THEN THE BUG GOT GOING AGAIN.
THE BUG GOT GOING AGAIN.
I'LL BET THE BUG WAS PRETTY DIZZY BY THIS TIME.
FOLLOW THE BUG.
UNDER THE TABLE.
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING?
OW!
HI, JESSE.
UH WE'RE JUST PLAYING FOLLOW THE LEADER.
OH, YEAH?
LOOKS TO ME LIKE YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING.
OH, WE'RE NOT LOOKING FOR ANYTHING.
WE WERE LOOKING FOR A RING.
THANKS FOR REMINDING ME, MICHELLE.
I PLUMB FORGOT.
WHAT RING WOULD THAT BE?
WOULD IT HAPPEN TO BE THIS RING?
WHERE'D YOU FIND THE RING?
IN THE COOKIE JAR.
THAT'S WHAT I TOLD YOU.
MAYBE NEXT TIME, YOU'LL LISTEN.
WANT A COOKIE?
I'LL COOKIE YOU.
SECURITY!
MORE, MORE!
I DON'T WANT TO GO TO BED YET!
WELL, DEEJ, YOU PULLED IT OFF.
JOEY WAS FUNNY.
JESSE'S BAND WAS HOT, AND YOUR DAD HARDLY SAID A WORD.
YEAH, THE PERFECT NIGHT.
BUT I FEEL SO AWFUL.
WELL, THAT'S OUR SHOW FOR TONIGHT.
LET'S HEAR IT FOR JESSE AND THE RIPPERS!
AND OUR SPECIAL GUEST, COMEDIAN JOEY GLADSTONE!
WELL, IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE, BUT IT'S ALMOST 9:00.
I CAN SEE THE MEN WITH THE MUD.
AND THAT CAN ONLY MEAN ONE  TIME FOR BINGO.
WELL, UH I DON'T WANT TO EMBARRASS ANYBODY, BUT I THINK WE SHOULD REALLY THANK THE PERSON WHO PUT TOGETHER TONIGHT'S FUND RAISER.
LET'S HEAR IT FOR D.J. TANNER.
COME ON UP, HONEY.
THANKS FOR COMING TONIGHT, EVERYONE.
WE RAISED ENOUGH MONEY TO BUY THAT NEW COMPUTER.
HOW ABOUT ONE MORE SONG FROM JESSE AND THE RIPPERS?
FEATURING A BRAND-NEW SINGER I'M VERY PROUD OF MY DAD.
LET'S GIVE IT UP FOR DANNY TANNER!
DEEJ, HONEY, I DON'T WANT TO EMBARRASS YOU.
DAD, THE ONLY THING I'M EMBARRASSED ABOUT IS THE WAY I ACTED TODAY.
BUST A MOVE, DAD.
UM, I GUESS I'M GOING TO SING A SONG, AND I'D LIKE TO DEDICATE IT TO D.J. OH, THANKS.
I USED TO SING THIS TO DEEJ WHEN SHE WAS JUST A LITTLE GIRL.
AND I REALLY HOPE SHE LIKES IT RIGHT NOW.

HEY, MICHELLE.
HOW YOU DOING?
THIS YO-YO IS BROKEN.
I HAVE SOMETHING BETTER FOR YOU.
SINCE I OPENED MY OWN SAVINGS ACCOUNT, I WANT YOU TO HAVE MY OLD PIGGY BANK.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
HEY, WHERE'S THE MONEY?
YOU HAVE TO EARN IT YOURSELF.
YOU CAN CHECK THE COUCH CUSHIONS, OR FIND SOMEONE WHO'S A SOFT TOUCH, LOOK REAL CUTE, AND SAY, "PLEASE FEED MY PIGGY".
PLEASE FEED MY PIGGY.
BOY, YOU PICKED THAT ONE UP REAL FAST.
HERE'S A QUARTER.
OOH, I LIKE THAT SOUND.
YAH.
BISHOP TO KING'S KNIGHT 4.
CHECK.
KING ME.
HELLO.
HI, STEPH.
HEY, SWEETIE, HOW WAS SCHOOL TODAY?
UH, JUST ANOTHER DAY IN THIRD GRADE.
HERE'S A SILLY NOTE FROM MY TEACHER.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO READ IT.
JUST SIGN IT.
YOU DON'T MIND IF I JUST SKIM IT, DO YOU?
STEPH, IT SAYS HERE THAT YOU'RE HAVING TROUBLE READING, AND YOU NEED YOUR EYES EXAMINED.
ISN'T THAT SILLY?
IF IT'S SO SILLY, LET'S SEE YOU READ THAT NOTE.
OK.
"DEAR MR.
TANNER, "LATELY, STEPHANIE HAS BEEN HOLDING HER PAPER VERY CLOSE TO HER FACE".
SEE?
NO PROBLEM.
YOU'RE GETTING YOUR EYES CHECKED.
BUT WHAT IF THEY TELL ME I NEED GLASSES?
I'M GONNA LOOK LIKE A GEEK.
SWEETHEART, YOU ARE NOT GONNA LOOK LIKE A GEEK.
BUT IF YOU DON'T TAKE CARE OF THIS NOW, YOUR EYESIGHT COULD GET WORSE.
ALL THOSE YEARS EATING CARROTS.
WHAT A WASTE.
PLEASE FEED MY PIGGY.
OH, I HAVE SOME PENNIES FOR YOUR PIGGY TO SNACK ON.
HE'S VERY HUNGRY.
YOU GOT ANY QUARTERS?
GO TALK TO YOUR DAD.
I GOT QUARTERS.
HERE YOU GO.
HERE'S A QUARTER.
HERE'S 50 CENTS.
HERE'S 75 CENTS.
OK, JESS, THIS IS THE LAST DECISION WE HAVE TO MAKE FOR THE WEDDING.
SHOULD THE WAITERS AT THE RECEPTION WEAR WHITE GLOVES?
WHO'S PAYING, AGAIN?
MY PARENTS.
GO FOR THE WHITE GLOVES.
ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S IT.
NO MORE DECISIONS.
WE'VE MADE EVERY TEENY, TINY, MINUSCULE, TRIVIAL DECISION ABOUT THIS WEDDING.
IT'S OVER.
HALLELUJAH!
WELL, HONEY, THERE IS ONE TEENY, TINY, MINUSCULE, TRIVIAL DECISION YOU'VE BEEN PUTTING OFF SINCE WE GOT ENGAGED.
WHO'S GONNA BE YOUR BEST MAN-- DANNY OR JOEY?
I KNOW I'VE BEEN AVOIDING THIS.
WHEN WE'RE ALL TOGETHER, I'LL PICK THE BEST MAN, AND THAT'LL BE IT.
GREAT.
DANNY, JOEY, GET IN HERE!
ARE YOU CRAZY, EMBARRASSING ME LIKE THIS?
I DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE I'M GONNA-- HI, BOYS.
HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?
WELL, UH, NOW THAT WE'RE ALL TOGETHER, THERE'S SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT.
WE'RE GOING WITH THE WHITE GLOVES.
WE'RE VERY HAPPY FOR THE BOTH OF YOU.
ACTUALLY, WE'VE PLANNED OUT THE WHOLE WEDDING, EXCEPT FOR ONE LITTLE DETAIL.
UH, I HAVE TO PICK A BEST MAN.
I CAN'T DO THIS.
I DON'T WANT TO HURT ANYBODY'S FEELINGS.
OH, JESS, IT'S NO BIG DEAL.
NOBODY'S FEELINGS ARE GONNA BE HURT.
THAT'S RIGHT.
WHATEVER YOU GUYS DECIDE IS FINE WITH US.
WE'RE MATURE ADULTS.
ALL RIGHT.
I PICK JOEY.
YES, I GET TO BE THE BEST MAN!
YES!
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT, IT'S COOL WITH ME.
CONGRATULATIONS, JOEY.
DANNY, I'D LIKE YOU TO BE MY HEAD USHER.
OH, HEY, THAT'S TERRIFIC.
WELL, IF FOR ANY REASON, JOEY IS UNABLE TO PERFORM HIS DUTIES AS BEST MAN, OR HE BRINGS DISGRACE TO HIS POSITION, THE HEAD USHER STEPS UP AND ASSUMES THE CROWN.
AH, SEE?
WELL, IF NEEDED, I'M READY TO SERVE.
THANKS FOR TAKING THIS SO GOOD.
HEY, I COULD STILL WIN THE SWIMSUIT COMPETITION.
* HANG DOWN YOUR HEAD, TOM DOOLEY * * HANG DOWN YOUR HEAD AND CRY * * HANG DOWN YOUR HEAD, TOM DOOLEY * * POOR BOY, YOU'RE BOUND TO * * DIE * DANNY.
* MET HER ON THE MOUNT-- ** THIS HAPPY LITTLE HANGING TUNE WOULDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH ME PICKING JOEY AS MY BEST MAN?
JESS, NOT AT ALL.
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT BEST MAN OR HEAD USHER, THERE'S NOT REALLY MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE.
THE BEST MAN GETS TO STAND NEXT TO THE GROOM, GIVE HIM THE RING, MAKE THE TOAST, BASICALLY BE THE STAR OF THE WEDDING.
AND THE HEAD USHER, HE GETS TO SAY, "I'M SORRY, THOSE SEATS ARE FOR THE FAMILY".
ARE YOU TRYING TO MAKE ME FEEL BAD?
'CAUSE IT'S WORKING.
I WOULD NEVER DO THAT TO YOU.
* SWING LOW, SWEET CHARIOT * I'M SORRY.
THOSE SEATS ARE FOR THE FAMILY.
* COMIN' FOR TO CARRY ME HOME * * SWING LOW-- ** DAD, YOU'VE GOT TO HELP US.
WHAT'S GOING ON?
MY COUSIN STEVE, HE'S IN TOWN FOR THE BIG SCIENCE FAIR, AND HE WON'T QUIT BUGGING US.
JULIE AND I ARE TRYING TO WRITE AN ARTICLE FOR THE SCHOOL PAPER, BUT HER COUSIN IS KIND OF, UH WHAT'S THE WORD I'M LOOKING FOR?
PAIN IN THE BUTT?
THAT'LL WORK.
THAT'S HIM.
DAD, YOU NEVER SAW US.
AND IF HE ASKS WHERE WE ARE, WE WERE NEVER HERE, AND WE'RE NEVER COMING BACK.
GOT IT.
HOW ANNOYING CAN ONE KID BE?
HONEY, I'M HOME!
STEVE URKEL, AT YOUR SERVICE.
HI, STEVE.
LISTEN, STEVE, D.J. AND JULIE WERE NEVER HERE, AND THEY'RE NEVER COMING BACK.
NEVER?
WELL, THAT'S OK, I'LL WAIT.
SAY, DO YOU HAVE A SPARE ACCORDION?
WE CAN JAM.
MY ACCORDION IS IN THE SHOP.
HOW YOU DOING?
I'M DANNY TANNER, D.J.'S DAD.
THAT'S JESSE KATSOPOLIS, MY BROTHER-IN-LAW.
JOEY'S NOT HERE.
HE'S, UH, JESSE'S BEST MAN.
I'M JUST THE HEAD USHER.
WELL, GEE, DANNY, YOU SOUND A LITTLE BITTER.
MAY I SUGGEST THAT YOU SUCK IT UP AND GET ON WITH YOUR LIFE?
KID'S GOT A POINT.
BOY, AM I HUNGRY.
GOT ANY CHEESE?
YOU CAN'T GO IN THERE, BECAUSE, UM, WE'RE OUT OF CHEESE.
NO PROBLEMO.
I'LL JUST POUR A GLASS OF MILK AND WAIT FOR IT TO CURDLE.
UH, STEVE, STEVE, STEEVO.
STEVE, I CAN'T HELP NOTICING YOU WALK LIKE THE HANGER'S IN YOUR SHIRT.
OH, WHY, THANK YOU.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
STEVE, I'D LIKE TO HELP YOU, BECAUSE, QUITE FRANKLY, YOU NEED HELP.
SEE, WHEN YOU'RE WALKING, YOU GOT TO BE LOOSE, MAN.
YOU GOTTA KINDA JUST LET IT BE COOL.
THAT'S IT.
LOOSEN UP.
BE VERY FLUID.
FLUIDITY IS THE KEY.
THAT'S THE MOVE.
THAT'S IT.
NOW, ONCE YOU GET IT GOING, YOU SHIFT THE WEIGHT, AND YOU GO, YOU SEE?
AND IT'S A STRUT, AND IT'S COOL.
AND IT'S A STRUT, AND IT'S COOL.
LIKE THAT.
SEE?
VERY INSPIRING.
ALL RIGHT.
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
THAT'S--THAT'S CLOSE.
WELL, THAT WAS A WALK ON THE WILD SIDE.
WELL, NOW LET'S TRY IT WITH YOUR ELBOWS OUT.
YOU'LL FIND IT'S MUCH BETTER FOR CIRCULATION.
LIKE THIS?
YEAH.
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL TRY IT.
YOU'RE DOING FINE.
YOU KNOW, I DO FEEL THE BLOOD FLOWING.
YEAH.
WHAT AM I DOING?
HERE'S ANOTHER FUN WAY TO KILL TIME.
LET'S SHARE OUR LIFE STORIES.
I'LL GO FIRST.
I WAS BORN ON A COLD CHICAGO NIGHT, 1976, THE YEAR OF AMERICA'S BICENTENNIAL.
MY MOM WAS IN GREAT PAIN, AND I WAS CHARGING THROUGH-- I THINK I HEAR THE GIRLS COMING HOME.
RIGHT IN THE KITCHEN AREA.
THERE YOU GO.
GOOD DAY, GENTLEMEN.
OK.
OH, LADIES!
D.J., Julie: AAH!
HEY!
HEY.
GUESS WHO GOT SOME NEW GLASSES.
GUESS WHO NEVER WANTS TO WEAR THEM.
COME ON, HONEY, I BET THEY LOOK GREAT.
I LOOK LIKE A TOTAL DWEEB.
COME ON.
HEY, LOOK AT THIS.
I WEAR READING GLASSES.
THERE.
DO I LOOK LIKE A TOTAL DWEEB?
NOT TOTALLY.
HONEY, PUT 'EM ON.
LET US SEE 'EM.
OK.
THERE.
YOU SAW 'EM.
FOR A SECOND THERE, I THOUGHT YOU ACTUALLY LOOKED SHARP.
YEAH, YOU LOOK VERY SOPHISTICATED.
THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN TELLING YOU SINCE WE LEFT THE EYE DOCTOR.
THANKS, BUT I KNOW YOU'RE JUST BEING NICE BECAUSE YOU'RE MY FAMILY.
DO I LOOK LIKE A DWEEB?
NO.
NO.
YOU'RE JUST BEING NICE 'CAUSE YOU'RE MY FAMILY.
HI, COMET.
YOU'LL BE HONEST.
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MY NEW GLASSES?
I KNEW IT.
I'M THE BIGGEST GEEK IN THIRD GRADE.
I THINK WE LOST HIM.
LOST WHO?
JUST SOME PESKY KID THAT KEEPS FOLLOWING US AROUND.
SOME PEOPLE JUST DON'T KNOW WHEN THEY'RE NOT WANTED.
HI, D.J. HI, JULIE.
HI, KID I DON'T KNOW.
STEVE, THIS IS MY SISTER MICHELLE.
IT'S A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU, MICHELLE.
WHY DO YOU TALK LIKE MICKEY MOUSE?
THAT'S BECAUSE I'M FROM CHICAGO.
WANT TO FEED MY PIGGY?
WELL, SURE.
HERE'S A BRIGHT, SHINY PENNY.
MICHELLE, DID YOU KNOW THAT WITH PREVAILING INTEREST RATES, THAT PENNY WILL BE WORTH ALMOST 3 CENTS AT THE TURN OF THE CENTURY?
YES, I DID.
STEVE, THIS IS MY OTHER SISTER STEPHANIE.
HI, STEPHANIE.
NICE TO MEET YOU, STEVE.
I DON'T MEAN TO BE RUDE, BUT I REALLY DON'T FEEL LIKE COMPANY RIGHT NOW.
IS EVERYTHING OK, STEPH?
I JUST FEEL LIKE BEING ALONE.
COME ON, GIRLS.
THE LITTLE LADY WANTS HER PRIVACY.
SO LET'S MAKE LIKE TOM AND CRUISE.
HEH HEH!
SO TELL ME, WHY SO MELANCHOLY, BABY?
I CAN'T TELL YOU MY PROBLEMS.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU.
OH.
WELL, I WAS BORN IN CHICAGO ON A COLD WINTER NIGHT IN 1976.
MY MOM WAS IN GREAT PAIN, AND I WAS CHARGING THROUGH-- OK.
OK.
I'LL TALK.
I JUST GOT MY FIRST PAIR OF GLASSES.
OH, WELL, WELCOME TO THE CLUB.
YOU KNOW, SOME PEOPLE LOOK FAR MORE ATTRACTIVE WITH GLASSES THAN WITHOUT.
TAKE ME, FOR EXAMPLE.
AS GOOD AS I LOOK NOW SEE HOW STUDLIER I BECOME.
TRULY AMAZING, BUT IF I WEAR THESE TO SCHOOL ALL THE KIDS ARE GONNA TEASE ME.
OH, SURE.
IN A CLASS OF 30, YOU MAY HAVE 15 OR 20 MISGUIDED SOULS THAT MAY SAY "HEY, 4 EYES" OR "YO, COKE BOTTLES" OR "¿QUE PASA, WINDOW FACE"?
BUT THAT WON'T BOTHER YOU, WILL IT?
WINDOW FACE?
THR TRICK IS TO MAKE 'EM LAUGH WITH YOU BEFORE THEY LAUGH AT YOU.
ALWAYS REMEMBER, HOLD YOUR HEAD UP HIGH.
OTHERWISE, THOSE SUCKERS WILL SLIDE RIGHT OFF YOUR NOSE.
HEH HEH HEH.
HI, BUDDY.
HEY, WHAT DO YOU SAY YOU AND I SPEND A LITTLE MORE QUALITY TIME TOGETHER, HUH?
LET'S GO OUT AND CLEAN SOME GROUT, SHALL WE?
I KNOW YOU'RE JUST BEING NICE TO ME BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T MAKE ME YOUR BEST MAN.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT GROUT IS.
LISTEN, THIS THING'S BEEN BUGGING ME ALL NIGHT.
I THINK I MADE THE WRONG CHOICE.
JOSEPH!
WAIT A MINUTE.
JESS, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I'LL TAKE CARE OF THIS NOW.
HEY, WHAT'S UP, JESS?
JOEY, I'M SORRY, BUT I MAY HAVE MADE A MISTAKE WHEN I PICKED YOU FOR BEST MAN.
IF I DID ANYTHING TO DISGRACE MY POSITION, I'M SORRY.
JUST PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME HEAD USHER.
LET ME FINISH, LET ME FINISH.
WHAT I MEAN TO SAY IS, I DON'T THINK I SHOULD HAVE PICKED JUST YOU.
I MEAN, I HAVE TWO BEST FRIENDS, SO I PICK BOTH OF YOU.
YOU CAN'T HAVE YEAH, YOU'RE BREAKING TRADITION, AND IT'S BAD GRAMMAR.
SINCE WHEN DO I CARE ABOUT TRADITION?
YOU'RE LOOKING AT A GUY WHO DIDN'T WEAR THAT CARDBOARD HAT AT HIS GRADUATION BECAUSE I WAS AFRAID IT WOULD RUIN MY COIF.
LOOK, THE 2 BEST MEN THING IS OK WITH ME IF IT'S OK WITH DANNY.
ANYTHING'S BETTER THAN BEING HEAD USHER.
AW, THANK YOU, MY BOYS, MY BOYS, ALL RIGHT.
OK, CLASS, TAKE OUT YOUR LIBRARY BOOKS FOR SILENT READING TIME.
STEPHANIE?
YES, MRS.
CLAIRE?
YOUR DAD CALLED ME THIS MORNING.
HE TOLD ME YOU GOT YOUR NEW READING GLASSES.
YEAH, I HAVE THEM RIGHT HERE.
SINCE WE'RE READING, MAYBE IT WOULD BE A GOOD TIME TO TRY 'EM ON.
MAYBE IT WOULD.
STEPH, YOU GOT GLASSES?
LET'S SEE.
THE TRICK IS TO MAKE 'EM LAUGH WITH YOU BEFORE THEY LAUGH AT YOU.
LET'S SEE YOUR NEW GLASSES.
HERE THEY ARE.
MY GLASSES FIT GREAT, BUT MY EYEBALLS ARE LOOSE.
RAAH!
I'M JUST KIDDING.
THOSE WEREN'T MY REAL GLASSES.
THESE ARE!
OH, NO.
MY HEAD SHRUNK.
AAH!
STEPHANIE, COULD I PLEASE SEE YOU AT MY DESK?
OOH.
OOH.
NOW YOU KIDS BEHAVE YOURSELVES.
I'VE GOT EYES IN THE BACK OF MY HEAD.
STEPHANIE.
ALL RIGHT, A NICKEL!
ALL RIGHT, A CHEETO!
ICE CREAM MAN!
ICE CREAM MAN!
ICE CREAM MAN!
WAIT FOR ME!
I GOT MONEY!
GIVE ME BACK MY MONEY, YOU PIG!
MICHELLE, WHAT'S WRONG?
I NEED ICE CREAM.
RIP HIS HEAD OFF!
MICHELLE, GET A GRIP.
THE WHOLE POINT OF A PIGGY BANK IS TO SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT.
ICE CREAM IS VERY IMPORTANT.
SORRY, MICHELLE.
THE ICE CREAM MAN IS GONE.
HE'S REALLY GONE?
PUT THE LIP AWAY.
IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT THERE ARE A BOX OF FUDGESICLES HIDDEN IN THE BACK OF THE FREEZER.
BUT IT'S NOT THE SAME.
DID I JUST HEAR THE ICE CREAM MAN?
YOU JUST MISSED HIM, BUT FOLLOW ME.
THERE ARE FUDGESICLES IN THE FREEZER.
BUT IT'S NOT THE SAME.
STEPH, WHAT ARE YOU WORKING ON?
OH, JUST SOME HOMEWORK.
OH.
"I WILL NOT DISRUPT THE CLASS.
I WILL NOT DISRUPT THE CLASS".
DID YOU BY ANY CHANCE DISRUPT THE CLASS TODAY?
YEAH.
I SNUCK INTO YOUR JOKE BAG AND BORROWED ALL YOUR FUNNY GLASSES.
THE TEACHER TOOK 'EM IN HER DESK, BUT YOU CAN HAVE THEM BACK AT THE END OF THE YEAR.
STEPH, THAT'S NOT LIKE YOU TO ACT UP IN CLASS.
I KNOW, BUT I HAD TO MAKE THEM LAUGH WITH ME BEFORE THEY COULD LAUGH AT ME.
OH, I GET IT.
CLASS CLOWN ROUTINE.
I DID THAT ONCE, EXCEPT I WAS THE CHUBBY KID.
THEY USED TO CALL ME WALRUS, SO I WOULD GO ARRR!
ARR!
ARR!
ARR!
YEAH, KIDS CAN BE PRETTY CRUEL SOMETIMES.
WHAT DID THEY SAY TO YOU?
WELL, THIS ONE KID SAID, "YOU GOT GLASSES?
LET ME SEE".
THAT WAS IT?
WELL, HE SAID IT PRETTY LOUD.
SO THEN NONE OF THE KIDS ACTUALLY TEASED YOU.
NO, BUT THEY WOULD'VE.
STEPH, ANYBODY WHO WOULD TEASE YOU IS A JERK, BECAUSE WITH OR WITHOUT YOUR GLASSES, YOU ARE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THIRD GRADER I KNOW.
I WANT YOU TO TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT YOURSELF WITH THOSE GLASSES ON, AND YOU'LL SEE YOU LOOK JUST FINE.
I ALREADY HAVE.
TRUST ME, IT WAS NOT A PRETTY SIGHT.
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU SAW WHAT YOU WERE AFRAID OF RATHER THAN WHAT WAS REALLY THERE.
NOW GET OVER TO THAT MIRROR, AND TELL ME WHAT YOU REALLY SEE.
OK.
COME ON.
NOW, WHAT DO YOU SEE?
HEY IT'S ME.
NO, IT'S THE NEW IMPROVED YOU, BECAUSE NOW YOU CAN READ.
THANKS, JOEY.
I FEEL BETTER.
YOU KNOW, I THINK YOU LOOK PRETTY MATURE.
REALLY?
MM-HMM.
YOU THINK I COULD PASS FOR A FOURTH GRADER?
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU PUT THE STEM OF YOUR GLASSES IN YOUR MOUTH AND THINK "UPPER ELEMENTARY SCHOOL"?
OOH, THAT RIGHT THERE, THAT'S FIFTH GRADE.
YEAH.
OH, HOT--OH, LOOK AT THAT.
HIGH-FASHION MODEL.
YOU'RE DRIVING.
WHAT KIND OF CAR?
LET'S GO ALL THE WAY.
PORSCHE.
YEAH.
ALL RIGHT!
THERE YOU GO, KIDDO.

I DO WHAT?
OH, THAT I DO.
RIGHT.
YEAH, YOU REMEMBER OUR WEDDING?
ALL OUR FRIENDS WILL BE THERE, WEDDING CAKE, THERE'LL BE MUSIC, THE BIG SQUARE DANCE, PHOTOGRAPHERS-- WHOA, WHOA!
BACK UP.
DID YOU JUST SAY SQUARE AND DANCE IN THE SAME SENTENCE?
OH, DID I FORGET TO MENTION THAT?
WELL, IT'S JUST, UH, MY FAMILY ALWAYS TOPS OFF EVERY BIG BASH WITH A GOOD OLD-FASHIONED SQUARE DANCE.
YOU KNOW, KIND OF A DONALDSON TRADITION.
YOU KNOW, THE KATSOPOLIS HAVE A TRADITION, TOO.
EVERY CHRISTMAS MY UNCLE NICK TRIES TO BALANCE A HAM ON HIS FOREHEAD.
THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE HAVE TO DO THAT AT OUR WEDDING.
OH, GEE, I LOVE CARNIVALS.
THE CHILI DOGS, THE FUDGE, THE COTTON CANDY, THE NACHOS, THE RIDES THAT GO ROUND AND ROUND, THE CRAMPS, THE GAS, THE NAUSEA.
EXCUSE ME.
I GOT A FISHY.
ALL RIGHT.
AND TELL THEM HOW YOU WON THAT FISHY.
I THREW A BALL INTO HIS BOWL.
GOOD SHOT.
YEAH, AT A QUARTER A THROW, IT ONLY COST ME $18.50.
CONGRATULATIONS, MICHELLE.
YOU GOT YOUR VERY FIRST PET.
YOU'RE GOING TO SLEEP IN MY BED.
OH, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SLEEP IN MICHELLE'S BED, FLIPPER?
UH-UH, UH-UH, UH-UH!
LET'S GO FIND HIM A FISH BOWL.
COME ON.
OK.
WHERE ARE THE GIRLS?
OH, D.J.'S OUT SAYING GOODBYE TO A BOY SHE MET AT THE CARNIVAL.
YOU'RE NOT OUT THERE WATCHING HER EVERY MOVE?
HEY, I DON'T HAVE TO SPY ON D.J. I TOLD STEPHANIE TO SPY ON HER.
I HAD A REALLY GREAT DAY TODAY.
SO DID I, BOBBY.
SO DID I, BOBBY.
STEPHANIE, WHAT ARE YOU STILL DOING HERE?
WELL, DEEJ, THE THREE OF US WERE HAVING SO MUCH FUN, IT JUST WOULDN'T BE THE SAME WITHOUT ME.
WOW!
DID YOU SEE THAT '71 CORVETTE GO BY?
OVERHEAD CAM, DUAL MANIFOLD, GLASS PACKS ON THE MUFFLER.
AWESOME!
YEAH, TOTALLY.
YOU LIKE CARS, TOO?
ARE YOU KIDDING?
I LOVE CARS.
OH, PLEASE!
SO WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE CAR?
UH RED.
OH, YOU MEAN THE NEW RED PORSCHE 911 TURBO.
YEAH, THAT'S THE ONE.
I WANT A PORSCHE ALL I NEED IS MY DRIVER'S LICENSE AND $80,000.
HEY, I'LL CALL YOU TOMORROW.
WE CAN TALK ABOUT CARS.
GREAT.
I'LL TALK TO YOU THEN.
ALL RIGHT.
SEE YOU.
BYE.
OH, BOBBY, I LOVE CARS.
BARFORAMA!
LOOK HOW HAPPY THAT FISH IS, MICHELLE.
HE'S GRINNING FROM GILL TO GILL.
IS IT A BOY FISH OR A GIRL FISH?
WELL, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA NAME YOUR FISH?
I WILL NAME YOU MARTIN.
WELL, THEN IT'S A BOY FISH.
MARTIN FISH.
SOUNDS LIKE MY ACCOUNTANT.
WHY DID YOU COME UP WITH THE NAME MARTIN?
BECAUSE THAT'S HIS NAME.
SORRY.
DUMB QUESTION.
NOW, MICHELLE, OWNING A PET IS A BIG RESPONSIBILITY.
IT'S GONNA BE YOUR JOB TO FEED HIM EVERY SINGLE DAY.
HE CAN HAVE ALL MY VEGETABLES.
WELL, THAT'S VERY GENEROUS OF YOU, MICHELLE, BUT I THINK MARTIN PREFERS FISH FOOD.
SO YOU GIVE HIM ONE LITTLE PINCH EVERY SINGLE DAY.
AND YOU HAVE TO KEEP HIS BOWL CLEAN BECAUSE, JUST LIKE PEOPLE, FISH LIKE TO BE CLEAN.
PINCH OF FOOD KEEP HIM CLEAN.
YOU GOT IT, DUDE.
MICHELLE, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
I'M TAKING MARTIN FOR A WALK.
FIRST RULE OF PET CARE, MICHELLE.
IF THEY DON'T HAVE LEGS, YOU DON'T WALK HIM.
THERE'S SO MUCH TO REMEMBER.
OH, GOOD.
YOU'RE NOT BUSY.
I'VE GOT A SURPRISE FOR YOU.
WHAT IN THE HEE-HAW IS THAT?
IT'S TIME FOR YOUR SQUARE DANCE LESSON.
HEH HEH.
OH, GOSH.
YOU KNOW I'D LOVE TO SIT AROUND AND SQUARE DANCE WITH YOU, BUT I'M VERY, VERY BUSY RIGHT NOW.
JESS, YOU'RE PLAYING WITH YOUR HAIRBRUSHES.
UH-UH-UH-UH.
I JUST ADDED A LAZY SUSAN TO MY HAIR ACCOUTERMENT CENTER FOR EASY ACCESS.
WATCH THIS.
NEED A COMB?
BA-DA-BOOM!
BAP!
YOU'RE RIGHT THERE.
UNCLE JESSE, I NEED YOU.
NOT NOW, DEEJ.
HE'S VERY BUSY ACCOUTERMENTING.
I JUST NEED TO BORROW SOME OF YOUR CAR MAGAZINES.
CAR MAGAZINES?
SINCE WHEN ARE YOU INTERESTED IN CARS, DEEJ?
WELL, I DECIDED I'M IN A RUT.
I NEED A NEW HOBBY.
WHO'S THE BOY?
WAIT A MINUTE, ARE YOU SAYING THAT JUST BECAUSE SHE'S A GIRL, SHE CAN'T BE INTERESTED IN CARS?
HIS NAME'S BOBBY.
HA HA HA.
HE'S CALLING TOMORROW, AND I TOLD HIM I KNEW EVERYTHING ABOUT CARS.
NO, THAT'S COOL, DEEJ.
I ALWAYS LIKED IT WHEN GIRLS WERE INTERESTED IN THE SAME THING I WAS.
YEAH, BUT SHE SHOULDN'T PRETEND TO LIKE SOMETHING JUST TO MAKE SOMEONE ELSE HAPPY.
REALLY?
SO I GUESS THAT TAKES ME OFF THE SQUARE DANCING HOOK, THEN, HUH?
OH, NO.
NO, THAT'S DIFFERENT.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PRETEND YOU LIKE IT.
I DON'T CARE IF YOU HATE IT.
YOU'RE STILL DOING IT.
OH, COME ON!
I'M NOT GOING TO SQUARE DANCE IN FRONT OF-- THIS IS JUST A WAY FOR-- YOU GUYS SOUND LIKE YOU'RE MARRIED ALREADY.
I'M PUTTING MY FOOT DOWN.
THAT'S A GOOD START.
NOW YOU PUT YOUR HANDS ON YOUR HIPS, AND YOU CIRCLE YOUR PARTNER.
COME ON, HONEY.
MICHELLE, YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE TAKING A BATH BY YOURSELF.
I'M NOT.
WELL, I SEE A FULL BATHTUB WITH LOTS OF BUBBLES IN IT.
AN EMPTY FISH BOWL.
MICHELLE, WHERE'S MARTIN?
HE'S TAKING A BUBBLE BATH.
YOU'RE GIVING MARTIN A BATH?
MARTIN, BUDDY, WE GOT TO GET YOU OUT OF HERE, PAL.
HE'S ALMOST FINISHED.
I'M KEEPING HIM CLEAN.
YEP, HE'S CLEAN AS A DOORNAIL.
HE'S NOT SWIMMING.
NO, HONEY, HE'S NOT.
IS HE SLEEPING?
YEAH, HE'S TAKING A NAP.
A VERY LONG NAP.
YOU FELL ASLEEP IN THE BATHTUB?
YOU'RE A SILLY FISH.
WHAT'S GOING ON, JOEY?
GUYS, WE GOT A PROBLEM.
NOW, BRACE YOURSELVES.
MARTIN TANNER IS DEAD.
OH, NO.
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.
THE POOR WHO'S MARTIN TANNER?
MICHELLE'S FISH.
HE DIED ALREADY?
ISN'T THERE, LIKE, A SIX-HOUR WARRANTY ON THOSE THINGS?
YOU SURE HE'S DEAD?
TRUST ME, I KNOW THE DIFFERENCE.
LIVE FISH MARTIN TANNER POOR MICHELLE.
HOW'S SHE TAKING IT?
WELL, FINE FOR NOW.
SHE THINKS HE'S JUST SLEEPING.
I DIDN'T HAVE THE HEART TO TELL HER THAT HE'S NEVER WAKING UP.
DON'T YOU THINK SHE'LL FIGURE IT OUT?
I MEAN, THE THING'S PROBABLY FLOATING ON TOP OF THE BOWL.
WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK IF MAYBE WE JUST PUT HIM ON A LITTLE RUBBER RAFT, AND TELL HER THAT HE'S WORKING ON HIS TAN?
JOEY, EITHER WAY, THIS FISH IS NOT A FUN PET ANYMORE.
I THINK WE'D BETTER TELL MICHELLE WHAT REALLY HAPPENED TO MARTIN.
YEAH, DANNY'S RIGHT.
MICHELLE'S A BIG GIRL.
I THINK WE OUGHT TO SIT HER DOWN AND EXPLAIN TO HER THE REALITIES OF LIFE AND DEATH.
DANNY, TELL US HOW IT TURNS OUT.
GUYS, COME WITH ME, PLEASE.
MARTIN, YOU CAN SLEEP WITH MY PIG TONIGHT.
MICHELLE, HONEY THERE'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO TELL YOU ABOUT MARTIN.
HE'S AN EXCELLENT SLEEPER.
UHNO, HONEY, MARTIN ISN'T SLEEPING.
I'M AFRAID HE'S GONE.
NO, HE'S NOT.
HE'S RIGHT HERE.
WELL, YES, HE IS HERE IN THE PHYSICAL SENSE, BUT IN ANOTHER SENSE, HE'SEVERYWHERE.
DANNY, I DON'T THINK THEY TEACH PHILOSOPHY UNTIL KINDERGARTEN.
YOU GOT TO LAY IT ON THE LINE.
DARLING, I'M SORRY TO TELL YOU, BUT YOUR FISHY IS D-- DE-- DE BEST SLEEPER IN TOWN.
JOSEPH.
THANK YOU, JESS.
MICHELLE, DO YOU REMEMBER THAT ONE ROADRUNNER CARTOON WHERE WILE E. COYOTE FALLS OFF A CLIFF, AND HE KIND OF HANGS THERE FOR A SECOND, AND THEN HE GOES  CRASH!
AND THEN HE FLATTENS INTO A PANCAKE, AND TWO LITTLE FEET POP OUT, AND THEN THE PANCAKE WALKS AWAY, AND YOU HEAR * WA WA WA WA WAH ** NOT A BIG HELP, HUH?
MICHELLE, HONEY, I'M SORRY, BUT MARTIN IS DEAD.
THIS IS NOT GOOD NEWS.
BUT, HONEY, NO FISH LIVE FOREVER.
THAT'S RIGHT, MICHELLE.
THE IMPORTANT THING IS TO REMEMBER ALL THE HAPPY TIMES THAT YOU AND MARTIN HAD TOGETHER.
LIKE THE CAR RIDE HOME, THE WALK TO YOUR ROOM GUESS THAT'S ABOUT IT, ISN'T IT?
WHERE ARE YOU TAKING MARTIN?
WE'RE GONNA GIVE HIM A PROPER BURIAL AT SEA.
ARE YOU GOING TO THE OCEAN?
EVENTUALLY.
BYE-BYE, MARTIN.
HONEY, ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS YOU NEED TO ASK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO MARTIN?
HOW DID MARTIN DIE?
WELL, MICHELLE, MARTIN DIED IN THE BUBBLE BATH.
I PUT HIM IN THERE.
WELL, WHEN I TOLD YOU THAT FISHIES LIKE TO BE CLEAN JUST LIKE PEOPLE, I SHOULD'VE ALSO MENTIONED THAT FISHIES DON'T TAKE BUBBLE BATHS.
NOW YOU TELL ME.
HONEY, IT WAS JUST AN ACCIDENT.
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT, DON'T YOU?
YES, I DO.
IT'S ALL MY FAULT.
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE ALL SET.
COME ON IN, JESS.
WE'RE READY!
FLYING MICHELLE!
I'M COMING, I'M COMING, I'M COMING, I'M COMING.
I'M HERE.
GUESS WHAT, MICHELLE?
WE HAVE A VERY SPECIAL SURPRISE FOR YOU.
A TOWEL?
THEY ARE SO LITERAL AT THIS AGE.
NO, IT'S NOT A TOWEL.
IT'S UNDER THE TOWEL.
IT'S YOUR NEW PET FISH!
NO, THANK YOU.
OH, COME ON, MICHELLE.
LOOK, THE FISHY LIKES YOU.
HE'S WAGGING HIS TAIL.
YEAH, HIS NAME IS FREDDY.
HE'S SAYING HI TO YOU, MICHELLE.
"HI, MICHELLE".
WATCH OUT, FREDDY.
I'M BIG TROUBLE, MISTER.
OH, NO, SWEETHEART.
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
WHAT HAPPENED TO MARTIN WAS JUST AN ACCIDENT.
BESIDES, FREDDY DOESN'T LIVE IN A LITTLE PLASTIC FISH BOWL.
HE'S IN A FISH PALACE.
LOOK, IT'S GOT GRAVEL, AND A FILTER, AND THERE'S MY PERSONAL FAVORITE.
A LIVE-IN SNAIL THAT CLEANS THE TANK THREE TIMES A WEEK.
I DON'T WANT A FISH.
LISTEN, MICHELLE, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.
WE'LL MAKE FREDDY THE FAMILY FISH, OK?
AND HE'LL JUST STAY HERE RIGHT IN THE KITCHEN, AND YOU CAN JUST BE HIS BUDDY, ALL RIGHT?
OK, BUT I'M NOT GETTING TOO CLOSE.
SWEETHEART, LISTEN.
THERE IS NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.
THAT FISH IS GOING TO LIVE A LONG, LONG TIME.
HE BETTER STAY OUT OF THE BATHTUB.
ARE YOU GUYS CRAZY, TELLING HER THAT FISH IS GONNA LIVE A LONG, LONG TIME?
THOSE THINGS DIE IF YOU LOOK AT THEM FUNNY.
JESS, WE GOT IT COVERED.
JOEY?
OK, DEEJ, HOW MANY CYLINDERS IN A CLASSIC 1966 FORD MUSTANG?
I DON'T KNOW.
200?
WRONG AGAIN.
THE CORRECT ANSWER IS 8.
HOW MANY QUESTIONS HAVE YOU ANSWERED WRONG SO FAR?
ALL OF THEM.
DING, DING, DING!
YOU FINALLY GOT ONE RIGHT.
HEY, GIRLS.
YOU READY FOR THE BIG FAMILY SQUARE DANCE LESSON?
BECKY, I CAN'T SQUARE DANCE RIGHT NOW.
I'M STILL CRAMMING FOR MY PHONE CALL WITH BOBBY.
WHY DID I EVER TELL HIM I KNEW SO MUCH ABOUT CARS?
BECAUSE YOU'RE BOY-CRAZY, AND YOU'LL DO ANYTHING TO IMPRESS HIM.
D.J., YOU DON'T HAVE TO PRETEND YOU'RE A CAR EXPERT.
I KNOW, BUT HE'S SO CUTE.
DEEJ, IF A BOY DOESN'T LIKE YOU FOR WHO YOU ARE, THEN HE'S NOT WORTH LIKING.
THAT'S BOBBY.
WHAT SHOULD I SAY?
JUST TELL HIM THE TRUTH.
HE'LL RESPECT YOU FOR YOUR HONESTY.
HELLO?
OH, HI, BOBBY.
LOOK, I WANT TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.
I THINK CARS ARE BORING AND THEY CAUSE POLLUTION, BUT I KNOW THAT WON'T MATTER TO YOU BECAUSE YOU-- HELLO?
BOBBY?
HE HUNG UP.
OOPS.
DEEJ, I'M SORRY.
THAT'S OK, BECKY.
ANY GUY WHO HANGS UP ON ME IS PROBABLY NOT MY TYPE.
BOY, DEEJ, I'M IMPRESSED.
YOU'RE TAKING THIS REJECTION REALLY WELL.
WELL, I'M BETTER OFF WITHOUT HIM, BUT HE WAS SO CUTE.
HI, FREDDY.
DON'T BE AFRAID.
I'M JUST GOING TO GET A COOKIE.
I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU A BATH.
OK, NOW, YOU ALL HAVE YOUR PARTNERS, AND I SHOWED YOU WHAT TO DO, SO LET'S COUPLE OFF AND FORM A SQUARE.
I HATE TO GET TECHNICAL, BUT WE FORMED A TRIANGLE.
WELL, IT'LL BE MUCH MORE SQUARE WHEN MY PARENTS ARE HERE.
YOU AIN'T KIDDING.
WHAT?
OH, I SAID I'LL DO YOUR BIDDING.
THAT'S ALL I ASK.
OK, NOW EVERYBODY JUST LISTEN TO THE MUSIC, AND I'LL CALL OUT THE INSTRUCTIONS.
BOW TO YOUR PARTNER.
BOW TO YOUR CORNER.
NOW, EVERYBODY, DOS-A-DOS.
ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE LOOKING GREAT EVERYBODY.
AND SWING YOUR PARTNER ROUND AND ROUND!
LIFT THAT GIRL RIGHT OFF THE GROUND!
WHOO-HOO!
NOW IF THAT WOMAN STARTS TO ROAM, JUST PROMENADE THAT LADY HOME.
TAKE IT, DANNY!
NOW RIGHT, LEFT, GRAND ONCE AND THEN ONCE MORE.
JUST DON'T LEAVE SCUFF MARKS ON THE FLOOR.
NOW ALL JOIN HANDS AND CIRCLE RIGHT-- MERRY CHRISTMAS TO ALL AND TO ALL A GOOD NIGHT.
I'M OUT OF HERE.
NO.
COME BACK IN LINE.
TAKE IT, JOEY!
PUT YOUR LEFT FOOT IN.
PUT YOUR LEFT FOOT OUT.

DO THE MONKEY AND THE MASH POTATO.
GET ON THE FLOOR AND DO THE ALLIGATOR!
AAH!
AAH!
AAH!
JESSE KATSOPOLIS, WHAT IS THAT ON YOUR FACE?
WHAT?
THAT'S A SMILE.
NO, IT ISN'T.
YES, IT IS.
YOU WERE ENJOYING YOURSELF.
YES, YOU WERE.
ALL RIGHT, I WAS.
THIS WILL BE FUN AT OUR WEDDING.
YOU KNOW, I CAN'T WAIT TILL NEXT WEEK, TILL WE'RE FINALLY HUSBAND AND WIFE.
HAVE MERCY.
SOMETHING'S HAPPENING TO THE FISHY!
WHAT'S GOING ON?
I DON'T KNOW, BUT IT'S NOT MY FAULT!
HURRY UP!
I SAID MOVE IT, MISTERS!
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
OOH, LITTLE TEENY, TINY THINGIES ARE SWIMMING IN THERE.
ALL I DID IS LOOK.
WELL, THESE ARE BABY FISH.
LOOK HOW CUTE THEY ARE.
LOOKS LIKE FREDDY'S A FRIEDA, HUH?
MICHELLE, IT'S A GOOD THING YOU WERE WATCHING THE TANK.
YOU SAW THE BABIES, AND YOU DID THE RIGHT THING BY TELLING US.
I DID?
YOU SURE DID.
AND NOW WE CAN TAKE THE MOMMY FISH OUT AND PUT HER IN A SPECIAL NURSERY TANK SO THE BABIES CAN GROW UP STRONG AND HEALTHY.
I DID A GOOD JOB.
COME ON, FRIEDA, GET IN HERE.
THERE MUST BE CAN I KEEP THE BABIES IN MY ROOM?
YES, HONEY, I THINK THEY'D BE VERY HAPPY THERE.
YOU REALLY CAME THROUGH FOR THOSE FISH.
YEAH, GOOD JOB, MUNCHKIN.
YOU'RE A HERO, MICHELLE.
YAY!
YAY!
YAY!
THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
CAN YOU BELIEVE HOW LITTLE THOSE BABIES ARE?
DADDY, WHERE DO BABIES COME FROM?
YOU KNOW, WHY DON'T WE GO BACK TO SQUARE DANCING, AND I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT THIS LATER, HONEY.
THAT SOUNDS GOOD.
PROMENADING'S A GOOD IDEA, HONEY.
HEY, GET BACK HERE.
WHERE DO BABIES COME FROM?

IT'S THE NIGHT BEFORE VALENTINE'S DAY.
TOMORROW, JESSE KATSOPOLIS AND REBECCA DONALDSON ARE GETTING MARRIED.
THE TANNER HOUSEHOLD IS ABUZZ WITH PREWEDDING EXCITEMENT.
Becky: WHERE'S JESSE?
JESS!
WHERE'S MICHELLE?
MICHELLE!
WHERE'S EVERYBODY?
THAT WAS THE BLUSHING BRIDE-TO-BE HERSELF.
ISN'T SHE RADIANT?
I ASKED JESSE TO BE HERE TO MEET MY PARENTS.
HOW COULD HE DO THIS TO ME?
BECKY, WE'RE TAPING THIS.
HELLO.
EVERYTHING IS FINE, RUNNING SMOOTH AS SILK.
THIS BETTER BE IMPORTANT.
I WAS COLORING.
LOOK.
IT'S THE FLOWER GIRL, MICHELLE.
SMILE, MICHELLE.
PLEASE, NO PICTURES.
MY HAIR IS A MESS.
MICHELLE, I HAVE A SURPRISE FOR YOU.
DO YOU REMEMBER MY NEPHEW HOWIE?
HOWIE?
NO.
WELL, DO YOU REMEMBER MY SISTER CONNIE?
CONNIE?
NO AGAIN.
WHEN YOU WERE 2 YEARS OLD, CONNIE BROUGHT HOWIE HERE TO VISIT.
YOU GUYS WERE BEST FRIENDS.
I GOT A BEST FRIEND?
THAT'S COOL.
COME ON IN, CONNIE.
HOWIE, LOOK, IT'S MICHELLE.
YOU'RE A BOY.
YOU'RE A GIRL.
EEW!
EEW!
YOU KNOW, MICHELLE, SOMEDAY, YOU'RE GONNA LIKE BOYS.
BUT NOT TODAY.
MICHELLE, WHY DON'T YOU SHOW HOWIE YOUR ROOM?
WHY?
BECAUSE HOWIE IS GONNA SLEEP OVER IN YOUR ROOM TONIGHT.
EEW!
EEW!
YOU GUYS ARE GONNA HAVE SO MUCH FUN.
I HOPE SHE HAS GOOD TOYS.
HEY, DON'T TOUCH MY STUFF, YOU BOY.
STEPH, COME ON, LET'S FOLLOW THE ACTION.
WAIT A MINUTE.
NOBODY'S GONNA SEE ME ON THIS TAPE.
HI, I'M STEPHANIE TANNER-- NIECE OF THE GROOM, BRIDESMAID, CAMERA WOMAN.
I PRETTY MUCH DO IT ALL.
WILL YOU COME ON?
BECKY.
I THINK SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH MY TUXEDO.
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
THE TAILOR ASSURED ME THE ALTERATIONS WOULD BE PERFECT.
WELL, MAYBE I HIT ANOTHER GROWTH SPURT.
MY PARENTS.
WHERE IS JESSE?
WHERE'S BECKY?
HAVE YOU SEEN THIS?
OH, THANK GOD.
I THOUGHT I WAS SHRINKING.
MOM.
HI, DARLING.
HI, DAD.
WHAT TOOK YOU GUYS SO LONG?
I THOUGHT YOU WERE RIGHT BEHIND ME.
WE WERE UNTIL I GOT CUT OFF BY SOME CRAZED MOTORCYCLE HOODLUM IN BLACK LEATHER.
SORRY I'M LATE.
I GOT STUCK BEHIND SOME WALNUT DRIVING 6 MILES AN HOUR.
THAT'S THE HOODLUM!
THAT'S THE WALNUT.
UH, NO.
THAT'S MY DAD, AND THAT'S MY FIANCÉ.
WELL, ISN'T IT A SMALL WORLD AFTER ALL?
IT'S SO NICE TO FINALLY MEET YOU, JESSE.
NICE TO MEET YOU, MRS.
DONALDSON.
YOU'D BETTER START CALLING ME MOM.
NAH, I'D FEEL FUNNY.
I SAID CALL ME MOM.
OK, MOM.
AND IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU POP?
YOU CAN CALL ME MR.
DONALDSON.
YOU KNOW, YOU WERE DRIVING A LITTLE FAST THERE, YOUNG MAN.
WELL, MAYBE IT JUST SEEMED THAT WAY 'CAUSE YOU WERE DRIVING A TAD ON THE SLOW SIDE, SIR.
I WAS KEEPING UP WITH THE FLOW OF TRAFFIC.
AH, BUT PARKED CARS DON'T COUNT AS TRAFFIC.
I ALWAYS SAY BETTER SAFE THAN SORRY.
AND I ALWAYS SAY MOVING IS BETTER THAN STANDING STILL.
OH, YOU HATE EACH OTHER!
OHH.
WHAT'S THE MATTER, HONEY?
WE DON'T HATE EACH OTHER.
WATCH--WATCH THIS.
POP!
SON!
SEE THAT?
THERE.
BUT YOU DON'T MEAN IT.
OH, IT'S OK, SWEETHEART.
THEY'LL GROW TO LOVE EACH OTHER.
WE'LL MAKE THEM.
NOW, YOU JUST SIT RIGHT HERE, AND I'LL GO GET YOU A GLASS OF WATER.
AND YOU TWO HUG LIKE YOU MEAN IT.
OH!
OH, MY GOD!
WHAT THE HECK?
WHAT IS GOING ON IN HERE?
OH, NOTHING.
UH, WE WERE JUST EXCHANGING PANTS.
BUT IN A GOOD WAY.
YOU SEE, WE WERE WEARING EACH OTHER'S CLOTHES.
MOM, DAD, THIS IS JOEY GLADSTONE AND MY CO-HOST, DANNY TANNER.
REMEMBER THOSE TAPES OF OUR SHOW I SENT YOU?
OH, OF COURSE.
YOU LOOK TALLER WITHOUT YOUR PANTS.
THANK YOU FOR NOTICING.
AW, WE MISSED EVERYTHING.
NICE LOOK, DAD.
EXCUSE US.
JESS, COULD I SEE YOU A MOMENT?
JESS, I JUST WANTED EVERYTHING TO BE PERFECT.
THE TUXEDOS DON'T FIT, MICHELLE'S UPSET BECAUSE HOWIE'S A BOY, YOU AND MY DAD HATE EACH OTHER.
OH, SWEETHEART.
I ADMIT IT WASN'T LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT, BUT YOU WEREN'T CRAZY ABOUT ME THE FIRST TIME WE MET.
GUESS IT JUST RUNS IN YOUR FAMILY.
LOOK, I PROMISE YOU I'LL BE FRIENDS WITH YOUR DAD.
YOU PROMISE?
I PROMISE.
ALL THAT STUFF, IT DOESN'T MATTER.
ALL THAT MATTERS IS TOMORROW AT 10 A.M., YOU AND I ARE GONNA BE HUSBAND AND WIFE.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I LOVE YOU.
I LOVE YOU, TOO.
THE LAST KISS BEFORE THE BIG "I DO"-- A MOMENT TO BE TREASURED.
I'M D.J. TANNER.
I AM RAPHAEL, THE TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLE.
EXCUSE ME.
EXCUSE ME.
I SAID EXCUSE ME!
BE QUIET, SHREDDER, YOU BAD GUY.
LET'S PLAY BARBIE DOLLS.
I COULD PULL HER HEAD OFF.
DROP THAT DOLL, YOU TURTLE.
THIS IS NUTS.
I'M OUT OF HERE.
WHAT DID I DO?
BOYS.
I DO.
I DO.
HO, I DO.
HI, JESS.
HELLO, MR.
DONALDSON.
OH, CALL ME KENNETH.
KENNETH, LISTEN, UH, I'M SORRY ABOUT BEFORE.
WE GOT KIND OF OFF TO A BAD START, DIDN'T WE?
LISTEN, YOU'RE GONNA MARRY MY DAUGHTER.
WE NEED TO START ACTING LIKE FAMILY.
GREAT.
CAN YOU LOAN ME 10 BUCKS?
A LITTLE SON/FATHER-IN-LAW HUMOR.
YEAH.
JESS, WE NEED TO TALK.
YES.
YES, WE DO.
LISTEN, SIR, I LOVE YOUR DAUGHTER VERY, VERY MUCH.
I'M GONNA TAKE VERY GOOD CARE OF HER, I PROMISE.
WHICH REMINDS ME, I COULDN'T HELP BUT NOTICE THAT YOU RIDE A MOTORCYCLE, YOU PLAY IN A ROCK 'N' ROLL BAND, YOU WEAR CLOTHES THAT SHOULD BE WALLETS.
THERE'S MUCH MORE TO ME THAN THAT, SIR.
I'M ALSO AN ELVIS FREAK.
I GOT A BIG COLOR OF HIM HERE.
BEAUTIFUL.
THAT'S FINE, SON, BUT YOU'RE MARRYING MY BABY TOMORROW.
YOU GOT TO PUT THAT NONSENSE BEHIND YOU.
THIS WOULDN'T BE YOU TELLING ME HOW TO LIVE, WOULD IT?
NO, I AM JUST OFFERING YOU THE BENEFIT OF MY EXPERIENCE.
YOU KNOW, YOU AND I ARE A LOT ALIKE.
OH, YEAH.
WE'RE TWO PEAS IN A POD.
EXACTLY.
WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE, I WAS A WILD ONE, JUST LIKE YOU.
NO.
YES.
BEFORE I SETTLED DOWN TO FARMING, I WAS ON THE RODEO CIRCUIT.
I COULD HOG-TIE A CALF IN UNDER 7 SECONDS.
I'VE ALWAYS WONDERED-- THIS IS A MYSTERY-- IF IT'S HOG-TIE, AND IT'S A CALF, WHY DON'T THEY CALL IT CALF-TIE?
STAY WITH ME, SON.
I'M GOING SOMEWHERE WITH THIS, OK?
NOW, WHEN I MARRIED NEDRA, I HAD TO HANG UP MY SPURS AND SETTLE DOWN.
AND SO WILL YOU.
I WILL?
SURE.
YOU'RE GONNA BE A HUSBAND WITH A WIFE, RESPONSIBILITIES, COMMITMENTS.
THAT'S PRETTY HEAVY, ISN'T IT?
GETS HEAVIER.
YOU PLAN ON HAVING KIDS SOMEDAY?
YEAH.
ALL RIGHT.
NOW, YOU PICTURE THIS.
YOU'RE HOLDING YOUR LITTLE BABY BOY.
JESSE JUNIOR?
JESSE JUNIOR.
AND ONE LOOK INTO THAT SWEET, INNOCENT FACE, AND YOU'LL BE TRADING IN YOUR HARLEY FOR A SENSIBLE FAMILY STATION WAGON.
I'M DRIVING A STATION WAGON?
WITH ONE OF THOSE GARFIELD DOLLS SUCKERED TO THE WINDOW.
AM I LISTENING TO TALK RADIO?
ALL FIVE BUTTONS.
AAH.
SON, WHAT I'M SAYING IS YOU'VE HAD YOUR LAST WILD ADVENTURE, SOWED YOUR LAST WILD OAT, RODE YOUR LAST BUCKING BRONCO.
GET THE POINT?
IT'S OVER.
CASE CLOSED, KISS IT GOODBYE, THE FAT LADY SANG-- I GOT IT, YEAH.
NOW, IF YOU'VE GOT ANY DOUBTS, YOU BETTER NOT WALK DOWN THAT AISLE TOMORROW.
UNDERSTAND?
YES, SIR.
WELL, YOU SLEEP TIGHT.
WHOA.
JESS, IT'S 7:00 IN THE MORNING.
WHERE ARE YOU TAKING ME?
SHH!
JOSEPH, TRUST ME.
THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME.
YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED IN THREE HOURS.
YOU ARE GETTING MARRIED, AREN'T YOU?
COME ON.
I'LL EXPLAIN EVERYTHING ON THE WAY TO THE AIRPORT.
THE AIRPORT?
YES.
NOW COME ON!
SHH!
MICHELLE?
MICHELLE.
HONEY, WAKE UP.
HAVE YOU SEEN UNCLE JESSE?
NO "GOOD MORNING, MICHELLE"?
I'M SORRY.
GOOD MORNING, MICHELLE.
NOW, HAVE YOU SEEN UNCLE JESSE?
NO GOOD MORNING KISS?
WHAT WAS I THINKING?
THERE.
NOW, HAVE YOU SEEN UNCLE JESSE?
NO, BUT THANK YOU FOR ASKING.
I KNEW SHE WAS SETTING ME UP.
JESSE?
HOLA, MR.
T. KIMMY, I'M GOING THROUGH A MAJOR CRISIS RIGHT NOW.
HEY, WE ALL GOT PROBLEMS.
D.J.!
I GOT TO BUILD A MOAT.
KIMMY, WHAT IS IT?
D.J., WHAT SHOULD I WEAR TO THE WEDDING?
THIS DRESS WITH THESE SHOES OR THIS DRESS WITH THESE SHOES?
KIMMY, THOSE ARE MY CLOTHES.
THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING YOU.
I FOUND A NOTE FROM UNCLE JESSE.
READ IT, STEPH.
WAIT.
I WANT TO GET THIS ON OUR WEDDING VIDEOTAPE.
OK, I'M READY.
ACTION.
"DEAR FAMILY, "YOU MUST BE WONDERING WHERE I WENT.
"I KIDNAPPED JOEY, "BUT WE'LL BE BACK FOR THE WEDDING.
"THERE WAS ONE LAST THING I HAD TO DO BEFORE I GOT MARRIED.
JESSE".
LET ME DO THAT AGAIN.
I CAN DO BETTER.
"DEAR FAMILY"-- STEPH!
OH, MAN.
JESSE'S GETTING MARRIED IN TWO HOURS.
WHERE THE HECK COULD HE BE?
JESS, YOU'RE TOTALLY OUT OF YOUR MIND.
I KNOW.
I SAID I'D NEVER GET IN A PLANE WITH YOU.
NO, I'M TALKING ABOUT SKYDIVING.
IT'S CRAZY.
PEOPLE SAY IT'S THE ULTIMATE RUSH.
I TOOK ALL THE LESSONS, BUT I NEVER JUMPED 'CAUSE IT WAS TOO WINDY.
JOSEPH, I'VE GOT TO HAVE THIS ONE LAST ADVENTURE BEFORE I GET MARRIED.
DO YOU HAVE TO DO THIS ON YOUR WEDDING DAY?
THIS IS THE LAST HOUR OF MY LIFE AS A SINGLE GUY.
PRETTY SOON, I'M GONNA BE MARRIED.
I'M GONNA HAVE A FAMILY WITH ALL THE RESPONSIBILITIES.
I MEAN, WHAT AM I GONNA DO THEN, JUMP OUT OF A STATION WAGON?
WELL, YOU COULD.
YOUR CHUTE MIGHT NOT OPEN IN TIME.
JOEY, LOOK, I HAVE TO DO THIS LAST CRAZY THING BEFORE GIVING IT UP FOR THE WOMAN I LOVE.
ISN'T FLYING WITH ME CRAZY ENOUGH?
NO.
HOW ABOUT WHEN I DO THIS?
AAH!
DON'T DO THAT!
I GOT THIS ALL PLANNED OUT.
I STASHED MY HARLEY, I GOT MY TUX ON.
I DO THE JUMP, HOP ON MY HARLEY, CRUISE TO THE CHAPEL IN JUST ENOUGH TIME TO REMOUSSE MY HAIR AND SAY "I DO".
A GREAT PLAN.
CAN I MAKE ONE LITTLE SUGGESTION?
WHAT?
SNAP OUT OF IT.
JOEY, THIS IS SOMETHING I HAVE TO DO FOR MYSELF, ALL RIGHT?
ALL RIGHT.
WELL HAVE A SAFE TRIP.
GOOD LUCK, BUDDY.
THANKS, PAL.
OH, AND JOSEPH, IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG I WANT YOU TO MARRY BECKY.
WHOA.
HAVE MERCY!
OH, MY GOD.
HE JUMPED WITHOUT HIS MOUSSE.
DID I FORGET MY MOUSSE?
THIS IS D.J. TANNER LIVE AT THE CHAPEL, AND THERE'S STILL NO SIGN OF THE GROOM.
DAD, HOW DO YOU FEEL?
OH, I FEEL VERY CONFIDENT THAT JESSE WILL ARRIVE RIGHT ON TIME IN THE NEXT IS THAT WHY YOU'RE NOT TELLING BECKY WHAT'S GOING ON?
NO, THAT'S BECAUSE I'M CHICKEN.
YOU HEARD IT HERE FIRST.
DAD IS CHICKEN.
THE FLOWER GIRL IS HERE.
OOH.
I'M READY FOR THE VIDEO.
MY HAIR LOOKS FANTASTIC.
DO SOMETHING.
NOW I'LL DO MY FISH FACE.
HEY, MICHELLE, WHERE'S HOWIE?
WHO CARES?
THAT BOY IS CRAZY.
HELLO, MICHELLE.
HELLO-O-O, HOWIE.
YOU LOOK VERY PRETTY.
YOU'RE A HUNK.
WHAT'S A HUNK?
THAT'S WHAT D.J. CALLS THE PAPER BOY.
UH, CUT, CUT.
EVERYTHING'S READY UP FRONT.
OH, THAT'S GOOD.
THAT'S VERY GOOD.
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
OH, THERE'S NO PROBLEM.
YOU'RE LYING.
I CAN TELL BY THE WAY YOU WON'T LOOK ME IN THE EYE.
CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS GUY?
OK, THERE'S A LITTLE PROBLEM.
YOU KNOW HOW EVERY WEDDING HAS A BRIDE AND A GROOM?
WELL, YOU TAKE AWAY THE GROOM, AND THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE HERE.
YOU TOOK AWAY THE GROOM?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
I DON'T KNOW.
HA!
WHY AREN'T WE STARTING?
DANNY, IS SOMETHING WRONG?
WRONG?
OH, NO, NOTHING'S WRONG.
WHAT COULD POSSIBLY BE WRONG?
EVERYTHING'S TOTALLY UNDER CONTROL.
THEN WHY WON'T YOU LOOK ME IN THE EYE?
WE'RE, UH, WE'RE NOT ALL HERE YET.
WELL, WHO'S MISSING?
I KNOW, I KNOW, I KNOW.
YES, MICHELLE?
UNCLE JESSE IS MISSING.
OH, MY GOD.
STAY CALM.
JUST BECAUSE THE GROOM'S NOT HERE, I AM NOT GONNA LET THAT RUIN MY WEDDING DAY.
MOM.
OH, HONEY.
WHEW!

WHERE'S JESSE?
WHERE'S JESSE?
UH-OH.
JOEY, WHERE IS HE?
HE MUST HAVE STOPPED OFF FOR A CAN OF MOUSSE.
OH, THANK GOODNESS.
YEAH, HE FORGOT IT WHEN HE JUMPED OUT OF THE PLANE.
HE JUMPED OUT OF A PLANE?
IT'S OK.
I TOOK HIM SKYDIVING.
LAST TIME I SAW HIM, HE WAS FLOATING SAFELY TO THE EARTH.
YOU TOOK HIM SKYDIVING?
WELL, THEN, WHERE IS HE?
WHAT IF SOMETHING HAPPENED TO HIM?
DON'T WORRY.
HE SAID IF ANYTHING HAPPENS, I SHOULD MARRY YOU MYSELF.
MOM!
IT'S ALL RIGHT, SWEETIE.

BECKY, I'M COMING!
DON'T MARRY JOEY!

I HAVE NOTHING BUT THE HIGHEST REGARD FOR TOMATOES, AND THE MEN AND WOMEN THAT DO GROW THEM, BUT I NEED A RIDE TO SAN FRANCISCO RIGHT NOW.
I DON'T GIVE RIDES TO TOMATO SQUASHERS.
THIS IS MY LIFE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT, OK?
NOT SOME DUMB VEGETABLE.
IT'S A FRUIT.
FRUIT, VEGETABLE.
LOOK, THE POINT IS-- I LIKE YOU, RED, AND I LIKE TOMATOES A LOT.
BELIEVE ME.

DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOU LANDED?
TOMATO COUNTRY?
THE MAKING OF A WEDDING-- THE SAGA CONTINUES.
THE GROOM IS NOW HERE'S THE MAN WHO LET HIM JUMP OUT OF A PLANE ON HIS WEDDING DAY.
JOEY GLADSTONE.
JOEY, HOW DO YOU FEEL RIGHT NOW?
SAD.
HURT.
ANGRY, BITTER, SCARED, USED.
AND I'M PRETTY HUNGRY.
I FORGOT TO EAT BREAKFAST.
POOR JOEY.
BREAKFAST IS THE MOST IMPORTANT MEAL OF THE DAY.
AND HERE'S BECKY WITH HER LOVING FAMILY.
ANY WORDS FOR UNCLE JESSE?
DARLING, I JUST HOPE YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.
BUT IF YOU ARE ALL RIGHT, I'LL KILL YOU.
DADDY, WHERE'S UNCLE JESSE?
HOLD ON, PLEASE.
HONEY, I'M TRYING TO FIND OUT.
WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO FIND OUT?
WHEN I FIND OUT, HOWIE.
DID YOU FIND OUT YET?
KIDS, IF YOU DON'T STOP THIS, I'M GONNA TURN THIS WEDDING AROUND AND DRIVE RIGHT HOME.
DADDY, YOU NEED A NAP.
YEAH.
PLEASE CALL ME IF YOU HEAR ANYTHING.
YES, SIR.
AND I'LL TRY TO SQUEEZE IN THAT NAP.
THANK YOU.
DADDY, IS IT TIME FOR THE WEDDING CAKE?
MICHELLE, WE CAN'T HAVE CAKE UNTIL WE HAVE A PARTY.
AND WE CAN'T HAVE A PARTY UNTIL WE HAVE A WEDDING.
HOWIE, WILL YOU MARRY ME?
WHY?
SO WE COULD EAT WEDDING CAKE.
IS IT CHOCOLATE CAKE?
WHO CARES?
IT'S THIS BIG, AND IT GOTS FROSTING.
HELLO?
IT'S JESSE.
JESSE, TELL ME WHAT'S-- LET ME TALK TO HIM.
ARE YOU OK?
HE'S OK.
OH, GOOD.
WHAT?
WELL, STAY RIGHT WHERE YOU ARE.
DANNY, JOEY, DON'T LET ANY OF THE GUESTS LEAVE.
I'M COMING BACK, AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE A WEDDING.
DAD, I NEED YOUR CAR KEYS AND YOUR WALLET.
NOW.
BUT, HONEY-- SHE SAID NOW.
YES, DEAR.
BECKY, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
TO TOMATO COUNTRY, TO BAIL MY GROOM OUT OF JAIL.
SHE BETTER HURRY.
SHE'S GOING TO MISS THE WEDDING.
THIS CROWD IS GETTING RESTLESS.
YOU GUYS BETTER LOCK THE EXITS.
JOEY, WE HAVE TO TELL THESE PEOPLE SOMETHING.
WE CAN'T TELL THEM THE TRUTH.
BUT I CAN'T LIE IN CHURCH.
NEITHER CAN I. WE'LL TAKE THEM OUT TO THE PARKING LOT AND WE'LL LIE TO THEM THERE.
THAT IS A DUMB IDEA.
WHAT'S UP?
WHERE'S MY BABY?
OH.
UMWELL THE TRUTH IS YOUR SON WOULD EVERYBODY LIKE TO ACCOMPANY ME TO THE PARKING LOT?
I KNOW WHY JESSE'S LATE!
HE'S IN THE SLAMMER!
YOU CAN ALL SIT DOWN NOW.
LOOK, YOU GOTTA LET ME OUTTA HERE, MAN.
I'M GETTING MARRIED RIGHT NOW.
WHY DON'T YOU BELIEVE ME?

JESSE.
TOLD YOU.
HI, HONEY.
HELLO, DARLING.
YOU LOOK MAD.
ARE YOU MAD?
UH-HUH.
OH, YOU'RE SO CUTE WHEN YOU'RE MAD.
AND RIGHT NOW, YOU'RE ABOUT THE CUTEST I'VE EVER SEEN YOU.
JESS, ARE YOU INSANE?
HOW COULD YOU DO THIS ON OUR WEDDING DAY?
ACTUALLY, THIS IS REALLY FUNNY.
YOU'RE GONNA LAUGH.
MAYBE YOU WON'T LAUGH.
NO, YOU'RE NOT GONNA LAUGH.
YOU SEE, I HAD THIS LONG TALK WITH YOUR DAD, AND HE TALKED TO ME ABOUT SETTLING DOWN AND BEING RESPONSIBLE, AND I HAD TO GO OUT AND GET THIS ONE LAST ADVENTURE.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "ONE LAST ADVENTURE"?
JESS, THE ADVENTURE IS JUST BEGINNING.
FOR BOTH OF US.
SHARING OUR LIVES AND HAVING A FAMILY.
AND, HEY, IF YOU WANNA JUMP OUT OF A PLANE, JUST LET ME KNOW.
I'LL STRAP ON A CHUTE, I'LL BE RIGHT THERE NEXT TO YOU.
THE POINT IS, WHATEVER THE ADVENTURE, LET'S JUST DO IT TOGETHER.
DARLING, YOU'RE THE BEST.
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL.
I'M DROPPING ALL THE CHARGES.

BIG GUY!
YEOW!
HOW WAS BORA BORA?
IT WAS BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL.
I GOT THE WHOLE HONEYMOON ON TAPE.
WELL, THE OUTDOOR STUFF.
WELL, WE TOOK SOME HOME VIDEOS, TOO.
WE FIGURED THAT YOU'D WANT TO SEE EVERY SINGLE THING THAT HAPPENED WHILE WE WERE GONE LAST WEEK.
START WITH DANNY MAKES TUNA SALAD.
YOU'LL LAUGH, YOU'LL CRY.
IT'S THE FEEL-GOOD MOVIE OF THE YEAR.
JESS, I HATE TO SAY THIS, BUT IF WE'RE GONNA GET YOU PACKED UP AND MOVED OVER TO MY APARTMENT, WE'D BETTER GET STARTED.
YEAH.
NOW'S AS GOOD A TIME AS ANY.
OK.
LET'S PACK UP.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
YOU JUST GOT HERE.
MICHELLE, I TOLD YOU.
NOW THAT I'M MARRIED TO YOUR AUNT BECKY, I'M GONNA LIVE AT AUNT BECKY'S HOUSE NOW.
WE'RE GONNA MISS YOU SO MUCH.
WELL, YOU GUYS DON'T HAVE TO MISS ME YET.
HELP ME PACK.
COME ON.
MICHELLE, IS SOMETHING WRONG?
THIS IS NOT GOOD NEWS.
HONEY, WE'RE STILL GONNA BE ONE BIG, HAPPY FAMILY.
NOW CHEER UP.
IT'S MOVING DAY.
WHAT IS MOVING DAY?
WELL, THAT'S WHEN WE ALL PUT EVERYTHING INTO BOXES, AND LOAD IT INTO A BIG, RED TRUCK, AND MOVE TO MY APARTMENT.
DO YOU WANT TO HELP?
YOU GOT IT, DUDE.
ALL RIGHT, BABE.
WE GOT WORK TO DO.
WE'RE MOVING TO AUNT BECKY'S HOUSE.
HEY, STEPH, HOW'S IT GOING WITH YOUR FRACTIONS?
IT'S HOPELESS.
I'LL BE STUCK IN THIRD GRADE FOREVER.
I'LL BE THE ONLY CARRYING A BARBIE LUNCH BOX.
STEPH, YOU'RE PUTTING WAY TOO MUCH PRESSURE ON YOURSELF.
WHY DON'T WE TAKE A LITTLE CUPCAKE BREAK?
GOOD IDEA.
I DON'T WANT TO LOOK AT ONE MORE FRACTION.
HEY, I'M WITH YOU.
WELL, LET'S SEE.
THERE'S TWO OF US AND ONE WHOLE CUPCAKE, SO I GUESS I'LL JUST CUT IT INTO TWO EQUAL PIECES.
OH, MY GOODNESS.
LOOK.
THERE'S ONE HALF FOR YOU AND ONE HALF FOR ME.
HEY, THAT'S NOT A CUPCAKE, THAT'S A FRACTION!
STEPH, I CAN'T HELP IT.
FRACTIONS ARE EVERYWHERE.
NOW, SUPPOSE I CUT THOSE TWO HALVES IN HALF.
WHAT DO YOU CALL THE PIECES?
DESSERT?
THANKS.
DON'T MIND IF I DO.
NEXT TIME I GIVE A MATH LESSON, I'M USING LIVER.
BYE.
SO, SQUIRT, WHEN ARE YOU MOVING INTO JESSE'S OLD ROOM?
I DON'T KNOW.
WHEN I'M IN THE MOOD.
WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE TO MOVE.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
WE'LL MOVE FOR YOU.
KIMMY, GRAB AN END.
WHOA, WHOA!
LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS.
OK, I'M IN THE MOOD, I'M IN THE MOOD.
* IT'S MOVING DAY, IT'S MOVING DAY * * HEY, BABY, HEY *  I SHOULD BE ON THE RADIO.
HMM HMM COMET, HELP ME CLOSE THIS.
I NEED A BIGGER DOG.
THIS THING'S HEAVY.
WHAT THE HECK'S IN HERE?
MY HAIR SUPPLIES.
PUT 'EM IN THE FRONT SEAT AND BELT THEM IN.
YOU GOT IT, DUDE.
WHAT DO YOU BENCH?
PROBLEM?
WELL, THAT'S THE LAST OF IT.
YOU KNOW, JESS, I ALWAYS KNEW YOU'D BE MOVING OUT SOMEDAY.
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE THAT DAY'S FINALLY HERE.
AH, NO SENSE GETTING SENTIMENTAL OVER THIS WHOLE THING.
OH, MY LITTLE PINK BUNNY.
REMEMBER WHEN YOUR ROOM WAS TOTALLY COVERED WITH STEPHANIE'S PINK BUNNIES?
YEAH.
I'LL NEVER FORGET THE DAY I MOVED IN HERE.
NICE, HUH?
ROOMY.
NOT OVERLY MASCULINE.
OH, GOLLY, IT'S SWELL.
YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD LOOK GREAT OVER HERE BY THE WINDOW?
BARBIE'S DREAM HOUSE.
WE'VE GOT ONE.
LOOK, JESSE, I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT HAVING YOU AND JOEY HERE REALLY MEANS A LOT TO ME.
JUST KNOWING SOMEBODY'S HERE WHO CARES ABOUT THE GIRLS.
THEY'RE SO HAPPY YOU'RE HERE.
OH, GOD BLESS YOU.
YOU'RE HUGGING ME IN A ROOM WITH PINK BUNNIES.
I'M SORRY.
I I'M AN EMOTIONAL GUY.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
OK, LET'S FACE IT.
I'M A LEAN, MEAN HUGGING MACHINE.
OK.
DANNYLISTEN.
PAM WAS MY BIG SISTER, AND I LOVED HER VERY MUCH.
AND I LOVE YOUR KIDS.
AND I'M HAPPY TO DO WHAT I CAN.
OH AAH!
YOU'RE HUGGING ME AGAIN.
NOW, LISTEN, YOU AND ME WILL SIT DOWN.
WE'LL SET ASIDE A SPECIAL TIME FOR HUGGING, BUT NOT NOW.
OH, GREAT.
I LIVE IN WEBSTER'S ROOM.
IT'S AMAZING.
I WAS ONLY GONNA MOVE IN HERE FOR 2 WEEKS.
I ENDED UP STAYING 4 YEARS.
WELL, THINGS SURE HAVE CHANGED, THOUGH.
WHEN YOU FIRST CAME HERE, YOU WEREA WILD, MOTORCYCLE-RIDING, ELVIS-OBSESSED ROCK 'N' ROLLER.
NOW WELL, YOUR HAIR'S A LITTLE SHORTER IN THE BACK.
JESS, IN CASE I HAVEN'T TOLD YOU ENOUGH LATELY, THANKS A LOT FOR HELPING ME ALL THIS TIME.
AH, WHAT THE HECK.
JUST THIS ONE TIME.
AW AW AW AW AND I GET CAUGHT.
AW AW AW AW I'M ALL PACKED.
LET'S GO, PEOPLE.
MICHELLE.
DIDN'T YOU HEAR?
WE'RE MOVING TO AUNT BECKY'S.
SWEETIE, UH I THINK YOU GOT THINGS A LITTLE MIXED UP.
YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
UNCLE JESSE'S THE ONE WHO'S LEAVING.
BUT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE A BIG, HAPPY FAMILY.
THE KID'S REALLY HAVING TROUBLE WITH THIS.
I'LL GO TRY TO EXPLAIN TO HER WHY I'M LEAVING.
MICHELLE, I THINK IT'S TIME FOR ONE OF OUR WORLD-FAMOUS TALKS, MAN TO MUNCHKIN.
WHY ARE YOU LEAVING ME?
DARLING, I'M NOT LEAVING YOU.
IT'S JUST THAT I'M MARRIED NOW, AND I HAVE TO LIVE WITH MY WIFE.
IT'S KIND OF A TRADITION.
I'LL BE OVER HERE ALL THE TIME, I PROMISE, AND I'M GONNA BE WORKING WITH JOEY.
I'M JUST A 10-MINUTE WALK FROM HERE.
ARE YOU STILL GONNA SING ME THE TEDDY BEAR SONG?
NO, NOT EVERY NIGHT, BUT YOUR DADDY AND JOEY, THEY'LL SING FOR YOU.
AND THEY SING I'LL TAPE IT FOR YOU.
I'M GONNA MISS YOU.
I'M GONNA MISS YOU, TOO, PAL.
BUT WE-- I HAVE TO PUT ON OUR BRAVEST FACE.
WE'VE GOT TO BE REALLY BRAVE ABOUT THIS THING, ALL RIGHT?
SO LET ME SEE YOUR BRAVE FACE.
CAN YOU SMILE FOR ME?
ATTA GIRL.
NOW THAT WE'VE GOT THIS BRAVERY THING HAPPENING, I WANT YOU TO GIVE ME THE BIGGEST, MOST GIGANTIC, MOST GREATEST HUG YOU EVER GAVE ME IN THE WHOLE ENTIRE WORLD.
READY?
AND GO!
HUG, HUG, HUG, HUG!
MMM, MMM!
ATTA GIRL.
THIS IS A GOODBYE PRESENT.
MICHELLE, IT'S YOUR PIG.
ARE YOU SURE?
YES, I'M SURE.
IN THAT CASE, HERE.
I WANT YOU TO HAVE THIS.
THIS IS MY PINK BUNNY.
PUT IT UP ON THE WALL.
AND WHENEVER YOU LOOK AT IT, YOU CAN THINK OF ME, OK?
YOU GOT IT, DUDE.
GOOD-BYE, MICHELLE.
GOOD-BYE, UNCLE JESSE.
ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S IT.
THAT'S THE LAST LOAD.
I AM NOT CARRYING ONE MORE THING IN HERE.
JESS?
AREN'T YOU FORGETTING SOMETHING?
BRIDE.
THRESHOLD.
ALL RIGHT.
HOP ON.
JESS!
KIDDING!
I'M KIDDING.
A LITTLE NEWLYWED HUMOR.
ALL RIGHT.
AND SHE'S UP.
SHE'S OVER.
THEY KISS.
AAH!
AND SHE'S DOWN!
HA HA HA!
WELL, BOY, THIS IS IT.
OUR NEW LIFE IN OUR NEW HOME HAS OFFICIALLY STARTED.
YEAH.
LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS NEW HOME OF OURS, SHALL WE?
LET'S REGROUP HERE AND TAKE A LOOK.
NOW, UHNO OFFENSE, BUT I THINK THE MOTIF HERE IS A LITTLE ON THE GIRLIE SIDE, IF YOU WILL.
WELL, I AM A GIRL.
YES, THAT'S ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS I MARRIED YOU.
THE POINT IS, A MAN LIVES HERE NOW.
WE'VE GOT TO MAKE IT A LITTLE MORE MANLY-- LIKE SOME MANLY NAUGAHYDE OVER THIS, WHICH WILL GO QUITE NICELY WITH MY HUBCAP END TABLES RIGHT HERE.
SWEETHEART, COME SIT DOWN.
NOW, BEFORE WE START REDECORATING OR PUTTING YOUR STUFF BACK INTO STORAGE, WHY DON'T WE JUST SIT BACK AND RELAX AND PRETEND LIKE WE'RE ALREADY UNPACKED?
LOVING IT.
LOVING-- MICHELLE'S PIG.
YOU KNOW WHAT I'D BE DOING RIGHT NOW IF I WAS HOME?
HONEY, YOU ARE HOME.
I-- I MEANT MY OLD HOME.
ME AND THE GUYS WOULD BE SINGING MICHELLE TO SLEEP.
* BABY, LET ME BE YOUR LOVING TEDDY BEAR * * PUT YOUR CHAIN AROUND MY NECK * * AND LEAD ME ANYWHERE * * OH, LET HIM BE * * OH, LET ME BE * * YOUR TEDDY BEAR * * YOUR TEDDY BEAR * * YOUR TEDDY BEAR * * YOUR TEDDY BEAR * * I JUST WANT TO BE YOUR TEDDY BEAR * * OOH ** THAT WAS A VERY GOOD TRY.
I KNOW, MICHELLE, WE'RE MISSING A THIRD OF OUR TRIO.
I MISS UNCLE JESSE.
I KNOW, SWEETIE.
WE ALL MISS UNCLE JESSE.
IT'S JUST GONNA TAKE A LITTLE TIME TO GET USED TO HIM NOT LIVING HERE.
BUT YOU'RE GONNA SEE HIM FIRST THING IN THE MORNING.
SO THE SOONER YOU FALL ASLEEP, THE SOONER UNCLE JESSE WILL BE HERE.
REALLY?
I'M GETTING VERY SLEEPY.
GOOD NIGHT, HONEY.
GOOD NIGHT, JOEY.
GOOD NIGHT, DADDY.
I LOVE YOU.
I LOVE YOU, TOO.
GOOD NIGHT, UNCLE JESSE.
KIMMY, DO YOU KNOW WHERE I AM RIGHT NOW?
ON MY SIDE OF THE ROOM.
AND GUESS WHERE I AM RIGHT NOW.
I'M STILL ON MY SIDE OF THE ROOM.
IT'S MINE, ALL MINE.
HOWDY, NEIGHBOR.
MISS ME?
UH-OH.
I'LL CALL YOU BACK.
I HAVE A VISITOR.
MAY I HELP YOU?
IT'S LONELY SLEEPING IN UNCLE JESSE'S ROOM.
I KNOW.
I MISS HIM, TOO.
WELL, GOOD NIGHT.
TELL ME, WHY ARE WE SO HAPPY WE HAVE OUR OWN ROOMS?
BECAUSE SLEEPING IN SEPARATE ROOMS WILL BRING US CLOSER TOGETHER.
IT WILL?
WELL, SURE.
SEE, WE'RE TOGETHER ALL THE TIME, SO WE NEVER HAVE A CHANCE TO MISS EACH OTHER.
BUT NOW THAT WE'RE APART, WE CAN MISS EACH OTHER LIKE CRAZY, AND IT'LL BRING US CLOSER TOGETHER.
GET IT?
I THINK SO.
FOR US TO GET CLOSER, I'VE GOT TO STAY AWAY FROM YOU.
EXACTLY.
NOW TRY IT.
I'M MISSING YOU ALREADY.
REALLY?
OH, YEAH.
I'M MISSING YOU EVEN MORE.
I GUESS IT'S WORKING.
WE HAVE NEVER BEEN CLOSER.
YES.
OK, EVERYBODY, WHO WANTS MORE PANCAKES?
ME!
ME!
I DO!
HERE YOU GO.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
YOU BETTER MAKE MORE.
THESE PEOPLE LOOK HUNGRY.
HEY!
UNCLE JESSE!
MY FAMILY!
HELLO!
OH, I'VE MISSED YOU ALL SO MUCH.
YOU GUYS MISSED THE CUTEST THING.
DANNY SAYS, "WHO WANTS MORE PANCAKES"?
MICHELLE TOOK THE WHOLE STACK, AND SAID  "YOU BETTER MAKE MORE.
THESE PEOPLE LOOK HUNGRY".
IT WAS FUNNY, UNCLE JESSE.
I MISSED IT?
DANNY, TAPE THESE THINGS.
NO PROBLEM.
I'LL JUST QUIT MY JOB AND VIDEOTAPE THEIR EVERY WAKING MOMENT.
GOOD.
AW ISN'T THIS GREAT?
THE WHOLE FAMILY'S BACK TOGETHER.
THAT'S RIGHT.
ONE WHOLE FAMILY.
WHAT A PERFECT TIME FOR A FRACTIONS LESSON.
NO!
PLEASE DON'T TURN MY PANCAKE INTO HOMEWORK.
JUST RELAX.
THIS TIME, I'M USING PEOPLE.
EVERYBODY STAND UP.
ALL RIGHT, NOW LISTEN, WE HAVE 7 PEOPLE HERE.
SO EACH PERSON IS 1/7.
BUT UNCLE JESSE AND AUNT BECKY, THEY DON'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE.
BUT I'M STILL PART OF THE FAMILY, RIGHT?
YES, BUT RIGHT NOW, YOU'RE A VISUAL AID.
SO AND 5/7 PLUS 2/7 EQUALS 7/7-- ONE WHOLE FAMILY!
STEPH, YOU JUST ADDED FRACTIONS.
I DID?
SURE DID.
I DID, I DID, I DID!
THANKS, EVERYBODY.
I'VE GOT TO GET TO SCHOOL WHILE I'M STILL HOT.
YOU KNOW SOMETHING?
NOW THAT SHE'S OUT OF MY ROOM, I THINK SHE'S ADORABLE.
COME ON, BECKY.
WE'VE GOT TO GET TO THE STUDIO.
ALL RIGHT, MICHELLE, I'M GONNA DRIVE YOU TO PRESCHOOL.
UNCLE JESSE, COULD YOU SING ME THE TEDDY BEAR SONG TONIGHT?
SURE.
WOULD IT BE OK, HONEY?
WE'LL JUST HAVE DINNER HERE, THEN I CAN PUT HER TO BED.
YOU KNOW WHAT, JESS?
THAT REMINDS ME.
WE CAN'T SLEEP AT HOME TONIGHT.
I COMPLETELY FORGOT.
THE EXTERMINATOR IS COMING OVER TO SPRAY FOR TERMITES.
I SET IT UP WEEKS AGO.
DANNY, IS IT OK IF WE SLEEP IN THE ATTIC TONIGHT?
SURE.
NO PROBLEM.
ALL RIGHT!
WE'RE SPENDING THE NIGHT!
DID YOU HEAR THAT, BUDDY?
WE COULD HAVE A PAJAMA PARTY.
GREAT.
SHALL I WEAR MY NINJAS OR MY CALIFORNIA RAISINS?
TWIN COTS.
I HOPE WALLY AND THE BEAV DON'T COME UP AND DISTURB US.
WARD?
YES, JUNE.
I HAVE A CONFESSION.
WE DON'T HAVE TERMITES.
DON'T TELL ME IT'S SILVERFISH.
I HATE SILVERFISH.
SWEETHEART, THERE AREN'T ANY INSECTS IN OUR APARTMENT.
I MADE IT UP BECAUSE I JUST THOUGHT YOU COULD USE A LITTLE FAMILY REUNION.
WAS I THAT OBVIOUS?
JESS, YOU SLEPT WITH MICHELLE'S PIG.
AW, THIS IS VERY SWEET OF YOU.
COME ON, LET'S GO HOME.
WE DON'T WANT TO SLEEP IN THIS ATTIC, RIGHT?
WELL, IT'SKIND OF NICE.
LIKE OUR OWN APARTMENT, YOU KNOW.
IT'S COZY AND PRIVATE.
FULLY INSULATED, WITH COMPLETE PLUMBING HOOKUPS FOR A FULL BATHROOM-- IDEAL FOR A YOUNG NEWLYWED COUPLE SAVING TO BUY THEIR FIRST HOME.
WHAT ARE YOU GETTING AT?
WELL, I TALKED TO DANNY ABOUT US LIVING UP HERE.
HE THINKS IT'S A GREAT IDEA, AND SO DO I. AH, BECK-- NAH, THIS IS NUTS.
HONEY, WE'RE A MARRIED COUPLE.
WE'RE MAN AND WIFE.
WE SHOULD HAVE A PLACE OF OUR OWN.
WE COULD MAKE THIS PLACE OUR OWN.
WELL, LOOK, I COULD NEVER ASK YOU TO MAKE THAT KIND OF SACRIFICE JUST BECAUSE I MISS MY FAMILY.
YEAH, BUT THEY'RE MY FAMILY, TOO, AND I LOVE THEM.
AND I LOVE YOU.
NOW, ADMIT IT.
YOU LIKE THIS IDEA, DON'T YOU?
WELL, THERE'S NOTHING IN THE WORLD THAT WOULD MAKE ME HAPPIER THAN MOVING BACK IN WITH MY FAMILY, BUT ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?
I INSIST.
OK.
AS A FAVOR TO YOU, WE'LL MOVE BACK IN.
HEY, EVERYBODY, GET UP HERE!
HE WENT FOR IT!
ALL RIGHT!
YAY!
START THE PAJAMA PARTY!
AW, YOU GUYS ARE THE BEST.
THANK YOU, DANNY.
IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU BACK.
JOEY, OUR EQUIPMENT'S UP HERE.
WHERE ARE WE GONNA WORK?
SIMPLE, JESS.
YOU GUYS MOVE INTO THE ATTIC, I MOVE INTO YOUR ROOM, THE STUDIO MOVES INTO MY ROOM, AND STEPH MOVES BACK IN WITH HONEY, I'M HOME!
WELL, I GUESS IT'S WORTH IT TO HAVE UNCLE JESSE AND AUNT BECKY HERE.
YOU KNOW, THEY SAY YOU CAN'T HAVE IT ALL, BUT I FEEL LIKE I DO.
I GOT THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WIFE IN THE WORLD, THE GREATEST FAMILY, REALLY COOL HAIR GREAT BIKE, A SHINY BIKE.
JESS, WE GET THE PICTURE.
SPEAKING OF WHICH, MICHELLE, WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO THE HONORS?
IT WOULD BE MY PLEASURE.
UNCLE JESSE, WELCOME HOME.

I'M PUTTING SOME NEW PLUMBING IN THE ATTIC, SO I HAD TO TURN OFF THE MAIN WATER LINE.
I HOPE I'M NOT INCONVENIENCING ANYONE.
JESS, ONE QUESTION.
DID YOU ACTUALLY WAIT UNTIL THE SHAMPOO WAS BURNING MY EYES BEFORE YOU TURNED THE WATER OFF?
NO, JUST DUMB LUCK.
HERE.
LET ME HELP YOU OUT THERE.
LET ME GET THIS SIDE HERE.
SO, DEEJ, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS ORANGE LIPSTICK?
IT'S PERFECT IF YOU'RE DATING RONALD McDONALD.
I'M BA-ACK.
OH.
OH.
THANK YOU.
YOU'RE TOO KIND.
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M SHARING MY ROOM WITH AN 8-YEAR-OLD AGAIN.
BELIEVE IT, BABE.
OH, NEAT.
WE'RE PLAYING MAKEUP.
WE DO NOT PLAY MAKEUP.
WE WEAR MAKEUP.
YEAH, KID.
GO WATCH SESAME STREET.
I DO NOT WATCH SESAME STREET.
AND BESIDES, IT'S NOT ON TILL 4:00.
WELL, NOW THAT YOU'RE BACK, REMEMBER THE RULES.
KEEP YOUR BABY STUFF ON YOUR SIDE OF THE ROOM.
I HAVE NO BABY STUFF.
Doll: MAMA!
YOU WERE SAYING?
YOU COULDN'T KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT?
AND NOW I'D LIKE TO PRESENT THE NEWEST ADDITION TO OUR FUTURE HOME-- THE LIGHT SWITCH.
OOH!
OOH!
AND IT ONLY TOOK HEY, WHAT IS 4 DAYS COMPARED TO A LIFETIME OF WORRY-FREE ON AND OFF, HUH?
READY?
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I FORGOT TO TURN THE ELECTRICITY BACK ON.
BETTER GO TAKE CARE OF THAT.
I DON'T WANT TO INCONVENIENCE ANYONE.
HOW DO YOU TIME THESE THINGS?
DO YOU HAVE A SURVEILLANCE CAMERA IN MY BATHROOM?
LOOK, I REALIZE I'M A LITTLE BEHIND SCHEDULE, BUT THIS IS MY NEW HOME.
I WANT TO BUILD THIS PLACE WITH LOVE, CARE, AND OLD-WORLD CRAFTSMANSHIP, SAME WAY MY ANCESTORS BUILT THE PARTHENON.
THE PARTHENON IS IN RUINS.
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU RUSH.
HONEY, I KNOW THAT YOU WANT TO TAKE YOUR TIME, BUT THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE OUR FIRST HOME, NOT OUR RETIREMENT HOME.
YOU KNOW, JESS, IT MIGHT SPEED THINGS UP IF I HELPED YOU.
NO, THANK YOU.
GREAT IDEA.
THANKS, JOEY.
WE ARE GONNA HAVE SUCH A GREAT TIME.
ALL RIGHT, I'LL FIND A LITTLE SOMETHING FOR YOU TO DO.
BE HONEST--DO YOU HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE IN CONSTRUCTION?
ARE YOU KIDDING?
I ONCE BUILT AN ENTIRE FOUR-BEDROOM RANCH HOUSE.
YOU DID?
YEAH.
I WOULD'VE BUILT THE GARAGE, TOO, BUT I RAN OUT OF LEGOS.
LEGOS.
LEGOS.
I RAN OUT OF I REDECORATED MY SIDE OF THE ROOM.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
EHH.
MICHELLE, YOU'RE SO YOUNG.
NOW THAT I'M ALMOST A TEENAGER, YOU CAN HAVE MY STUFFED ANIMALS, MY BARBIE, MY PUPPY POSTER, ALL MY LITTLE-KID STUFF.
WHAT ABOUT THIS LITTLE-KID TV?
NICE TRY, SIS.
OH, MYLANTA.
HELLO, LADIES.
LOOK, DEEJ.
IT'S YOUR EVIL MINI-TWIN.
CHECK IT OUT, GIRLS.
I'VE GOT MY SIDE OF THE ROOM JAMMIN'.
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME?
WHAT CAN I SAY?
MATURE MINDS THINK ALIKE.
GIRLS, BECKY AND I HAVE TO GET TO THE STATION, AND-- OH, WOULD YOU LOOK AT THOSE MATCHING OUTFITS?
ISN'T THAT ADORABLE?
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS SHOULD BE OUR NEXT CHRISTMAS CARD.
BOY, I REMEMBER WHEN I USED TO DRESS UP LIKE MY OLDER SISTER.
SHE HATED IT.
HA HA.
LOVE YOU.
LOVE YOU.
LOVE YOU.
LOVE YOU.
MR.
T!
SORRY, GIBBLER.
I WAS JUST ON A ROLL.
WELL, WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO NOW?
OH, I DON'T KNOW.
WE COULD WATCH MTV, CALL SOME BOYS, SHAVE OUR LEGS.
WHO ARE YOU?
COME ON, DEEJ, LET'S GO TO THE FOOD COURT.
I HEAR THEY HAVE A NEW POTATO TOPPING AT THE HOUSE OF SPUDS.
I WANT TO WEAR SOMETHING FUN.
FOLLOW ME.
I'M RIGHT BEHIND YOU.
SO AM I. I'M COMING, TOO.
SO, THIS IS YOUR DAD'S ROOM.
I BET IF THESE WALLS COULD TALK, THEY WOULD GO SO, DEEJ, WHAT ARE WE DOING IN HERE?
WELL, I'M IN HERE BECAUSE I'M GONNA BORROW ONE OF DAD'S SHIRTS AND TIES.
YOU'RE IN HERE BECAUSE YOU'RE A PAIN.
I RESENT THAT.
I RESENT THAT, TOO.
DID YOU KNOW YOUR DAD HAS A BOX OF BAKING SODA IN HIS UNDERWEAR DRAWER.
KIMMY, DON'T TOUCH THAT.
MY DAD CAN TELL IF YOU MOVE ANYTHING AN INCH.
NOW I'M JUST GONNA GET A SHIRT AND TIE, AND WE'LL BE OUT OF HERE.
HMM THIS ONE LOOKS GOOD.
AND DAD'S NOT SCHEDULED TO WEAR IT UNTIL NEXT THURSDAY.
I'M IN LUCK.
HERE'S ANOTHER ONE JUST LIKE IT.
FORGET IT.
THERE'S NO WAY YOU'RE GOING OUT OF THIS HOUSE DRESSED LIKE ME.
DID YOU EVER THINK JUST MAYBE YOU'RE THE ONE DRESSING LIKE ME?
LEAVE THE SHIRT ALONE.
NO.
LEAVE IT ALONE!
YOU'RE IN BIG TROUBLE, MISTER.
LOOK WHAT YOU DID NOW.
GET OUT OF MY WAY.
I HAVE TO FIX IT.
I CAN FIX IT MYSELF.
LET GO OF IT!
YOU LET GO.
I SAID LET GO!
OK.
WELL, I CAN SEE BY THE OLD HOLE IN THE WALL THAT IT'S TIME FOR ME TO GO.
YOU GIRLS WILL NEVER LEARN.
WE'RE DEAD!
DAD IS GONNA BE HOME ANY MINUTE!
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?
I KNOW.
LET'S BLAME KIMMY.
THAT WON'T WORK.
WE HAVE TO FIX THE HOLE.
RIGHT.
WE GOT TO FIX THAT HOLE.
WELL, GO AHEAD.
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO FIX IT.
BUT I KNOW SOMEONE WHO DOES.
STEPHANIE, FOLLOW ME.
WHAT ABOUT ME?
YOU STAY RIGHT HERE AND WATCH THAT HOLE.
YOU GOT IT, DUDE.
I'M GOOD AT THIS.
NAIL.
NAIL.
HAMMER.
HAMMER.
TUNA.
TUNA.
YOU KNOW, JESS, I CAN HANDLE A LOT MORE RESPONSIBILITY.
EVEN PAT LETS VANNA SPIN THE WHEEL ONCE IN A WHILE.
HEY, THE ATTIC'S LOOKING REALLY GOOD.
HOW ABOUT THIS SANDWICH I MADE, HUH?
VERY NICE.
HEY, UNCLE JESSE, AREN'T YOU WORRIED THAT YOU MIGHT MISS AND PUT A HOLE IN THE WALL?
I DON'T MISS.
WELL, WHAT IF JOEY MISSED?
WHY WOULD I GIVE JOEY A HAMMER?
WELL, WHAT IF JOEY TOOK YOUR HAMMER WITHOUT YOUR PERMISSION?
THEN THERE'D BE A HOLE.
HOW WOULD YOU FIX IT?
WELL, GIRLS, BASICALLY, WHAT I WOULD DO-- EXCUSE ME.
LET THE MAN WITH THE TOOL BELT EXPLAIN.
NOW, TO FIX A HOLE IN THE WALL IS QUITE SIMPLE.
YOU TAKE A PIECE OF DRYWALL YOU TAKE SPACKLE, PUT THAT ON, SMOOTH IT, SAND IT, PAINT IT, AND KISS THE HOLE GOODBYE.
UNCLE JESSE, HOW COME THAT WINDOW FRAME IS CROOKED?
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
JOSEPH, LEVEL.
YES, SIR!
GETTING THE LEVEL, SIR!
HANDING THE LEVEL, SIR!
SUCK IN THAT GUT.
SUCKING IN, SIR!
THAT'S LEVEL THAT'S LEV-- GIRLS, YOU'RE CRAZY.
THIS IS PERFECTLY LEV-- WHERE DID THEY GO?
YOU KNOW THESE KIDS TODAY.
THEY JUST DON'T APPRECIATE LEVELING LIKE WE USED TO.
YEAH.
SAD BUT TRUE.
OK.
I'M GONNA FIX MY WALL BED OVER THERE.
JOSEPH, ELECTRICAL TAPE.
YES, MASTER.
YES, I'LL DO YOUR BIDDING, MASTER, GET YOU THE ELECTRICAL TAPE, MASTER, BUT PLEASE, DON'T LEVEL MY HUMP.
YOU SEE?
THIS IS THE EXACT IMMATURE ATTITUDE THAT MAKES ME THE KING OF HOME IMPROVEMENT AND YOU BUT THE COURT JESTER.
OK, FINE.
DO IT ALL YOURSELF.
WELL, AT LEAST IT'LL BE DONE RIGHT.
WHOA.
WHOA!
WHOA!
JOEY!
JOEY!
HELP ME!
HARK.
IS THAT THE KING ASKING THE COURT JESTER FOR HELP?
SOUND THE TRUMPETS.
JOSEPH, JUST GET ME OUT OF HERE!
IS THERE A SWITCH?
IT'S IN MY TOOL BELT.
I HAVEN'T PUT IT IN YET.
GOOD PLANNING, YOUR MAJESTY.
I'M IN HERE!
IF I SEE YOU LAUGH ONCE-- YOU WON'T.
THERE.
I'M OK NOW.
I MUST HAVE SHORT-CIRCUITED THE WIRE.
CUT ME OUT OF HERE.
ISN'T THERE SOMETHING YOU'D LIKE TO SAY FIRST, SOMETHING WITH THE WORDS "I'M SORRY" IN IT?
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
OK, OK, OK, OK, OK.
I'M SORRY.
FOR WHAT?
MAYBE I WAS A TAD ON THE BOSSY SIDE-- OK, OK, OK, OK.
I WAS A POWER-CRAZED MANIAC.
AND?
AND--AND I SHOULD LEARN TO LET PEOPLE HELP ME AND NOT DO EVERYTHING MYSELF, OK?
OK.
I'LL HELP YOU GET OUT OF THERE.
THERE'S JUST ONE THING I WANT TO ASK FIRST.
WHAT?
ARE YOU REALLY STUCK IN THERE?
YES.
ARE YOU SURE THAT YOU'RE REALLY, REALLY STUCK IN THERE?
YES.
GOOD, 'CAUSE THERE'S SOMETHING I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO DO.
WHAT?
HEY, NOT THE HAIR!
NOT THE HAIR!
LEAVE MY HAIR ALONE!
NOW!
NOW, JOSEPH!
JOSEPH, JOSEPH, JOSEPH, JOSEPH, JOSEPH, STOP!
THAT OUGHT TO DO IT.
LOOKS GOOD TO ME.
YOU WOULD NEVER KNOW A POLE WENT THROUGH THAT WALL.
ARE YOU NUTS?
MICHELLE, DON'T STARE RIGHT AT IT.
IF YOU GLANCE AT IT REAL FAST, YOU DON'T EVEN NOTICE IT.
WATCH.
NOW YOU TRY.
I STILL SEE IT.
WHO ARE WE KIDDING?
DAD IS GONNA FREAK.
THIS NEVER WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF YOU WEREN'T FOLLOWING ME AROUND TRYING TO ACT LIKE A TEENAGER.
THAT DOESN'T MATTER NOW.
NOTHING MATTERS.
WE'RE GONNA BE GROUNDED IN OUR ROOM FOREVER!
STEPH, DON'T PANIC.
I HAVE AN IDEA.
THAT'LL NEVER WORK!
YOU HAVEN'T EVEN HEARD IT.
LET'S MOVE THE DRESSER TO WILL COVER THE HOLE.
LIKE I SAID, THAT'LL NEVER WORK.
DAD NOTICES EVERYTHING.
HE SEES US WHEN WE'RE SLEEPING, HE KNOWS WHEN WE'RE AWAKE-- STEPH, THAT'S SANTA CLAUS.
NOW LISTEN TO ME, ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS MOVE EVERYTHING ELSE ALONG THIS WALL OVER TO THE RIGHT, AND HE'LL NEVER NOTICE WE MOVED THE DRESSER.
NOW COME ON.
HELP ME PUSH.
Danny: GIRLS, I'M HOME.
HE'S HOME!
WE'RE DEAD!
WE'RE DEAD!
WE'RE DEAD!
WE'RE NOT DEAD YET.
WE CAN STILL PULL THIS OFF.
NOW, MICHELLE, I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU THE MOST IMPORTANT JOB YOU'VE EVER HAD.
DO I GOT TO WATCH THE HOLE AGAIN?
NO.
YOU HAVE TO GO DOWNSTAIRS AND STOP DAD FROM COMING UP HERE.
HOW DO I DO THAT?
UH, TALK TO HIM.
KEEP HIM BUSY.
DO WHATEVER IT TAKES.
CAN YOU DO IT?
I CAN DO IT!
GREAT.
GO GET HIM.
DO YOU THINK SHE CAN DO IT?
NOT A CHANCE.
COME ON, HURRY UP.
GIRLS?
HI, DADDY.
OHWELL, IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU, TOO, SWEETHEART.
OH, ISN'T THIS FUN?
OKEY-DOKEY.
HELLO.
I CAN DO A CHEER-- GO, TEAM, GO!
TA-DA!
WELL, THAT--THAT'S VERY GOOD, SWEETHEART.
I CAN SAY MY PHONE NUMBER-- WHOA.
THAT'S VERY GOOD, TOO, SWEETHEART.
I CAN SAY IT WITH MY EYES CLOSED.
WELL, YOU'LL NEVER TOP THAT ONE, SWEETHEART.
NOW I'M GONNA GO UPSTAIRS AND FIND YOUR SISTERS.
THEY'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING WRONG.
WELL, THAT PRETTY MUCH MEANS THEY ARE, DOESN'T IT?
YOU CANNOT GO UPSTAIRS.
OH, YES, I CAN.
HE'S COMING!
HE'S COMING!
HE'S COMING!
HE'S COMING!
HE'S COMING!
HE'S COMING!
HE'S COMING!
HE'S COMING!

HURRY.
HE'S COMING.
HURRY.
HE'S COMING!
HE'S COMING!
HE'S COMING!
HE'S COMING!
HE'S HERE.
I DID THE BEST I COULD.
SHE EVEN TOLD ME HER PHONE NUMBER WITH HER EYES CLOSED.
QUESTION IS, WHY DID SHE TELL ME HER PHONE NUMBER WITH HER EYES CLOSED?
AND WHY ARE THE TWO OF YOU IN MY ROOM?
DARN, IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A SURPRISE.
IT WAS?
STEPH, YOU CAN STOP PLAYING DUMB NOW.
WELL, THE REASON WE'RE IN YOUR ROOM IS BECAUSE WE WE'REWRITING A SONG ABOUT YOU.
RIGHT.
AND WE NEEDED SOME INSPIRATION.
REALLY?
MM-HMM.
MM-HMM.
I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR THE SONG THAT MY ROOM INSPIRED.
UH, WHY DON'T YOU SING IT FOR HIM, STEPH?
UHWHY DON'T WE BOTH SING IT?
* DAD, DAD, DAD, DAD, DAD * TAKE IT, DEEJ!
* HE'S OUR DAD * * AND HE'S GOT A REALLY CLEAN ROOM * TAKE IT HOME, STEPH!
* HE KEEPS IT THAT WAY * * WITH A MOP AND A BROOM * BIG FINISH!
* DAD, DAD, DAD, DAD * * HE'S OUR DAD ** YOU KNOW, GIRLS, HEARING THAT BEAUTIFUL SONG MAKES ME REALIZE THAT YOU TWO ARE DEFINITELY UP TO SOMETHING.
DOES THAT MEAN YOU DIDN'T LIKE OUR SONG?
ALL RIGHT, YOU TWO, LOOK, I LOVED YOUR SONG.
YOU KNOW, I'VE HAD A HARD DAY, SO I'M GONNA JUST BUY THIS SONG THING, ALL RIGHT?
EVERYBODY LOOKS HAPPY AND HEALTHY.
WHAT THE HECK?
GUESS I'M A LITTLE OFF TODAY.
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE A NAP?
YEAH.
YEAH, MAYBE I WILL.
JUST, UH, DON'T MISS THE BED.
HMM.
* DAD, DAD, HE'S OUR DAD * I CAN'T BELIEVE WE GOT AWAY WITH IT!
WE NEVER GET AWAY WITH ANYTHING.
THAT WAS A LITTLE TOO CLOSE.
LET'S NOT PUNCH ANY MORE HOLES, OK?
DEAL.
WASN'T THAT THE DUMBEST SONG YOU EVER HEARD?
* DAD, DAD, DAD, DAD, DAD, DAD * * DAD, DAD, DAD, DAD ** MICHELLE, WHY ARE YOU SINGING?
I LOVE THAT SONG.
YOU LOVE IT?
WE JUST MADE IT UP.
ALL IT DOES IS GO * DAD, DAD, DAD, DAD, DAD, DAD, DAD * THAT'S WHY I LOVE IT.
I KNOW ALL THE WORDS.
* DAD, DAD, DAD, DAD, DAD, DAD * CAN YOU BELIEVE HER?
SHE WANTS TO DO EVERYTHING I DO.
DO YOU FIND THAT ANNOYING WHEN YOUR LITTLE SISTER ALWAYS WANTS TO COPY YOU?
OH.
I GET IT.
I GUESS I'M ALWAYS ANNOYING YOU.
WELL, NOT ALL THE TIME.
YOU SAVED US WITH THAT SILLY DAD SONG.
YOU WERE PRETTY TRICKY.
I LEARNED IT FROM WATCHING YOU.
I AM GOOD, AREN'T I?
LOOK, IN A FEW YEARS, YOU'RE GONNA MAKE A PRETTY COOL TEENAGER.
REALLY?
YEP.
BUT UNTIL THEN, DO ME A FAVOR?
JUST STICK TO BEING A PRETTY COOL KID.
YOU THINK I'M A COOL KID?
YEAH, YOU'RE A COOL KID.
I'M BA-ACK.
SO, LADIES, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO NOW?
GIRLS.
YES, DAD?
SOMETHING'S BEEN BOTHERING ME SINCE YOU LEFT.
AND I HAVE FINALLY FIGURED OUT WHAT IS WRONG WITH MY ROOM.
WHO MOVED THE BAKING SODA IN MY UNDERWEAR DRAWER?
BY THE WAY, I LOVE THAT DAD SONG.
HOW DOES IT GO AGAIN?
* DAD, DAD, DAD, DAD * WHAT'S THAT MOP AND BROOM PART?
* HE'S GOT A REALLY CLEAN ROOM * * AND HE KEEPS IT THAT WAY WITH A MOP AND A BROOM ** CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY WARNER BROS.

IT WILL BE MY PLEASURE.
WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
* I'M GOIN' FOR A WALK * * IT'S NO BIG DEAL * GEE, MICHELLE, WAIT A SECOND.
I COULD HAVE SWORN I HAD A BAG OF COOKIES IN THERE FOR AFTER DINNER.
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHERE THEY WENT?
ARE THEY PEANUT BUTTER CHOCOLATE CHIP?
YES, THEY ARE.
I NEVER SAW THEM.
I WONDER WHERE THOSE COOKIES COULD BE.
COULD THEY BE UNDER THIS SHIRT?
HOW DID THEY GET THERE?

HELLO.
Danny: HI.
HI.
HEY.
OH, SORRY, DEEJ.
I DIDN'T SEE YOU.
I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING YOU FOR 3 BLOCKS.
HOW COME YOU DIDN'T SAY HI?
I DID.
THIS DOES NOT MEAN HI.
STEPH, I SEE WE HAVE COMPANY HERE.
AREN'T YOU GOING TO INTRODUCE US?
OH, SORRY, DAD.
THIS IS MY BRETT-- I MEAN, MY FRIEND BRETT.
HI.
HI, I'M HER DAD.
NICE TO MEET YOU.
NICE TO MEET YOU, TOO.
BRETT PLAYS FOR THE CUBS.
LAST YEAR, HE HIT .
421, HAD SIX STOLEN BASES, AND ONLY MADE ONE ERROR.
BUT IT WASN'T HIS FAULT 'CAUSE THE BALL HIT A ROCK.
DID I GET THAT RIGHT?
PERFECT.
THIS YEAR, US GIANTS ARE GONNA KICK YOUR LITTLE-- RUSTY.
I'VE GOTTA GET TO PRACTICE.
I'LL SEE YOU AT SCHOOL TOMORROW.
I'LL WAIT FOR YOU BY THE WATER FOUNTAIN, BRETT.
BYE.
BYE.
"I LL WAIT FOR YOU BY THE WATER FOUNTAIN, BRETT".
* STEPHANIE'S IN LOVE * NO, I AM NOT.
CAN I HELP IT IF WE BOTH LIKE WATER?
STEPH, YOU WERE KIND OF DROOLING OVER BRETT.
I WAS?
NO, IT'S JUST AN EXPRESSION.
COME ON.
WE NEED TO TALK.
RUSTY, TODAY'S AN IMPORTANT DAY FOR YOU, SON, BECAUSE I'M GOING TO TEACH YOU HOW TO SLIDE WITHOUT GETTING DIRTY.
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE, COACH.
NOT IF YOU SCOTCHGARD BEFORE EVERY AT BAT.
ISN'T BRETT MEGA CUTE?
DON'T YOU LOVE HIS CURLY BROWN EYELASHES?
DO YOU THINK HE LIKES ME?
WELL, IT'S HARD TO TELL.
BOYS AT THAT AGE ARE SO IMMATURE.
ACTUALLY, BOYS AT ANY AGE ARE IMMATURE.
IT'S WEIRD.
I MEAN BOYS WERE ALWAYS CHASING ME, AND I NEVER REALLY CARED.
BUT WHENEVER I'M WITH HIM, MY HEART GOES BRETT-BRETT.
BRETT-BRETT.
BRETT-BRETT.
HOW DO I GET HIM TO BE MY BOYFRIEND?
WHAT DO I DO?
WHAT DO I SAY?
WHAT SHOULD I WEAR?
MAYBE I SHOULD CHANGE MY HAIR COLOR.
STEPH, GET A GRIP.
NOW LOOK, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS HANG OUT TOGETHER.
WHAT DO YOU BOTH LIKE?
WELL, WE BOTH LIKE THE PORK AND BEANS IN THE CAFETERIA.
AND WE BOTH LIKE TO PICK OUT THAT CUBE OF FAT THAT'S ALWAYS IN IT.
THERE'S A LOVE CONNECTION.
NOW, KEEP THINKING.
WHAT ELSE DOES HE LIKE?
BRETT LOVES BASEBALL.
WELL, YOU'RE GOOD IN SPORTS.
WHY DON'T YOU TRY OUT FOR LITTLE LEAGUE?
YOU KNOW YOU CAN BE ON DAD'S TEAM.
BRETT AND I COULD TALK ABOUT BASEBALL ALL DAY.
DEEJ, YOU'RE A GENIUS.
OF COURSE, I'M AN EXPERIENCED WOMAN.
YOU KNOW, IT'S AMAZING THAT A WOMAN WITH YOUR EXPERIENCE DOESN'T HAVE A BOYFRIEND.
WELL, I'M PLAYING HARD TO GET.
OH.
WELL, YOU'RE DOING A REALLY GOOD JOB.
HUH?
OH!
JESS, OUR FIRST NIGHT IN OUR NEW APARTMENT.
YOU KNOW, HONEY, YOU DID A REALLY TERRIFIC JOB WITH THE ATTIC.
THANK YOU.
WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN MY PIECE DE RESISTANCE.
OOH.
THAT IS REALLY TACKY BUT I LOVE IT.
HELLO, MR.
AND MRS.
KATSOPOLIS.
OH, GOODY.
MICHELLE'S HERE.
IT'S TIME TO PLAY.
MICHELLE, WE ALREADY PLAYED DOWN IN YOUR ROOM.
NOW WE CAN PLAY IN YOUR ROOM.
MICHELLE, YOUR UNCLE JESSE AND I, WELL, WE'D SORT OF LIKE TO BE ALONE.
WE ARE ALONE, SILLY.
ALL RIGHT, MICHELLE, YOU WANNA PLAY A GAME?
LET'S PLAY AIRPLANE, OK?
YAY!
ALL RIGHT!
WE'VE BEEN CLEARED FOR A TAKEOFF, AND SHE'S UP AND HERE WE GO.
HEY!
THERE'S NO PEANUTS.
THERE'S NO MOVIE, BUT THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM FOR LANDING OUTSIDE THE DOOR.
THANK YOU FOR FLYING AIR KATSOPOLIS.
HAVE A NICE DAY.
NOWWHERE WERE WE?
HEY, YOU LOCKED ME OUT!
GOOD NIGHT, MICHELLE.
WE'LL SEE YOU IN THE MORNING.
FINE.
I'M LEAVING, BUT YOU'RE GOING TO MISS ME.
JOEY, I'M VERY MAD.
HOLD ON JUST A SECOND, MICHELLE.
HOW CAN I POSSIBLY OWE THIS MUCH IN INCOME TAX?
HMM, YOU THINK MAYBE THEY'LL BELIEVE THAT I HAD A $10,000 BUSINESS LUNCH AT THE SIZZLER?
DON'T YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY I'M VERY MAD?
OK, WHY ARE YOU VERY MAD?
UNCLE JESSE LOCKED ME OUT.
NOW, WHY WOULD UNCLE JESSE DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT?
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M A FUN GIRL.
WELL, I'M JUST GUESSING, MICHELLE, BUT I THINK UNCLE JESSE AND AUNT BECKY JUST WANT SOME PRIVACY.
WHAT IS PRIVACY?
WELL, PRIVACY MEANS THAT THEY JUST WANT TO SPEND TIME TOGETHER, JUST THE TWO OF THEM.
WHAT ARE THEY DOING IN THERE?
WELL, THEY'RE, UH THEY'RE DOING THEIR TAXES.
ARE THEY GOING TO DO THEIR TAXES EVERY NIGHT?
FOR THE FIRST COUPLE OF MONTHS.
I DON'T LIKE THIS ONE BIT.
WELL, MAYBE I CAN HELP YOU WITH THIS, MICHELLE.
WE BETTER GO RIGHT NOW.
THIS IS SERIOUS.
OK, OK.
JESS.
REBECCA.
JESS.
WE'RE NUTS.
IT'S THE KID AGAIN.
ALL RIGHT, KILL THE MUSIC.
THIS TIME, I'M GETTING TOUGH.
WE'RE SLEEPING, HONEY.
THEN WHY ARE YOU TALKING, ANGEL?
IT'S THE BIG KID.
JESS, MICHELLE HAS A BIG PROBLEM.
YES, MICHELLE, WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?
YOU TELL HIM, JOEY!
I'M TOO MAD!
WELL, MICHELLE THINKS YOU DON'T HAVE TIME TO SPEND WITH HER ANYMORE.
I'M MADDER THAN THAT.
I'M SORRY.
HAVE YOU NO DECENCY?
ALL THIS SWEET LITTLE GIRL WANTS TO DO IS SPEND SOME TIME WITH HER AUNT AND UNCLE WHO SHE LOVES.
IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK?
I THINK NOT.
MUCH BETTER.
MICHELLE, NOW, YOUR AUNT BECKY AND I LOVE YOU VERY, VERY, VERY MUCH, AND WE'RE SORRY FOR HURTING YOUR FEELINGS, BUT WE NEED TO SPEND SOME TIME ALONE.
MICHELLE, I HAVE AN IDEA.
HOW ABOUT IF THE 3 OF US SET ASIDE SOME SPECIAL TIME EVERY DAY FOR YOU TO COME UP HERE AND PLAY?
I'D LIKE THAT.
ALL RIGHT, IT'S A DEAL.
OK, JOEY, LET'S GO PLAY.
I CAN'T, MICHELLE.
I HAVE TO DO MY TAXES.
HAVE YOU NO DECENCY?
ALL THIS YOUNG LADY WANTS TO DO IS HANG OUT WITH HER PAL JOEY, WHO SHE LOVES VERY MUCH.
IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK?
I THINK NOT.
STEPH, HONEY, I KNOW YOU LIKE HANGING OUT WITH YOUR DAD, BUT DO YOU REALLY WANT TO TRY OUT FOR LITTLE LEAGUE?
DAD, I'VE DONE SOME SERIOUS THINKING, AND I'VE DECIDED THAT BASEBALL IS MY LIFE.
YOU JUST LIKE BASEBALL 'CAUSE BRETT LIKES BASEBALL.
I BET YOU CAN'T EVEN THROW.
I CAN, TOO.
OW!
WHOA.
THIS BABE'S GOT AN ARM.
HEY, MY DAUGHTER IS NOT A BABE.
SHE DOES HAVE AN ARM.
STEPH, LET'S TRY SOMETHING HERE.
RUSTY, COME HERE.
GIVE ME THE BALL, SON.
NOW GRAB YOURSELF A BAT, AND I WANT YOU TO STAND IN THERE.
STEPH, I WANT YOU TO WIND UP REALLY HARD AND PITCH ONE INTO ME RIGHT NOW.
OK?
RIGHT IN HERE.
WHOA!
DID YOU SEE THAT BALL CURVE?
I SURE DID.
STEPH, HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO PITCH FOR THE GIANTS?
GREAT.
THANKS, DAD.
NOW, WHAT ARE WE GONNA CALL THAT PITCH OF YOURS?
THE TANNER TWISTER.
THIS SATURDAY WE'RE GONNA KILL THE CUBS.
YEAH.
WE'RE GONNA DESTROY THEM.
WE'RE GONNA CREAM THEM.
WE ARE GOING TO MAKE THE CUBS EAT DUST.
I LOVE BEING A JOCK.
OK, JOCK.
LET'S GO.
COME ON DOWN, EVERYBODY!
BREAKFAST IS READY!
MICHELLE IS SO EXCITED.
I TOLD HER SHE COULD BE BATBOY AT THE GAME TODAY.
DADDY, I'M HERE.
MICHELLE, YOU'RE NOT FIGHTING CRIME, YOU'RE HANDING OUT BASEBALL BATS.
AW, NUTS.
CAN I STILL WEAR THE CAPE?
SURE, SWEETHEART.
STEPHANIE, GUESS WHO'S HERE TO SEE YOU?
WHO?
BRETT-BRETT.
BRETT-BRETT.
BRETT-BRETT.
D.J., PLEASE.
DOESN'T HE LOOK GREAT IN THAT UNIFORM?
YES, BUT DON'T LET HIM KNOW THAT.
BE COOL.
GOT IT.
HI, STEPH.
HELLO.
YOU LOOK GREAT IN THAT UNIFORM.
BEGINNERS.
YOU KNOW, IT'S TOO BAD OUR TEAMS ARE PLAYING EACH OTHER OPENING DAY.
YEAH.
I HOPE YOU WIN.
I HOPE WE WIN, TOO.
I HOPE IT'S A TIE.
WANT TO SEE WHAT I WROTE ON MY BAT?
"S.T." WITH A HEART AROUND IT?
S.T. FOR STEPHANIE TANNER.
OH, BRETT.
DOES THIS MEAN WHAT I THINK IT MEANS?
I HOPE IT MEANS YOU'RE MY GIRLFRIEND.
ALL RIGHT!
I MEAN THAT'S COOL.
WELL, GOOD LUCK TODAY.
GOOD LUCK TO YOU, TOO.
HEH.
THANKS.
I'LL NEED IT.
I HEARD NOBODY CAN HIT THE TANNER TWISTER.
YEAH.
I EVEN STRUCK OUT MY DAD.
OH, NO.
MY WHOLE FAMILY'S GONNA BE THERE.
IF I GET STRUCK OUT BY MY OWN GIRLFRIEND, I'LL NEVER HEAR THE END OF IT.
YOU PROBABLY WON'T STRIKE OUT.
I HOPE NOT.
I HATE TO EVEN SAY THIS, BUT IF YOU THREW ME A COUPLE OF EASY ONES, I'D BE SURE TO GET A HIT.
ISN'T THAT CHEATING?
KIND OF, OR IT COULD JUST BE A GIRLFRIEND HELPING A BOYFRIEND.
WELL, YOU COULD LOOK AT IT THAT WAY.
GREAT!
THANKS FOR HELPING ME, STEPH.
I'LL SEE YOU AT THE GAME.
SO, STEPH, WHAT DID BRETT WANT?
OH, HE JUST CAME BY TO WISH ME GOOD LUCK.
COME ON, HONEY.
LET'S EAT.
STAR PITCHERS NEED THEIR ENERGY.
DAD, WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TODAY IF, SAY, I DIDN'T PITCH TOO WELL?
LIKE IF I GAVE UP A COUPLE OF HOME RUNS OR SOMETHING?
STEPH I DON'T WANT YOU TO PUT ANY PRESSURE ON YOURSELF.
ALL THAT MATTERS IS THAT WITH EVERY PITCH YOU THROW, YOU'RE DOING THE BEST YOU CAN.
OK?
OK.
OK.
OK, STEPH!
STRIKE HIM OUT!
STRIKE!
COME ON, STEPH.
HEY, BATTER, BATTER, STRIKE OUT.
GET 'EM, STEPHIE!
STRIKE 3!
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THE TANNER TWISTER STRIKES AGAIN.
THAT BRINGS UP DANGEROUS BRETT DAVIS.
DAVIS HIT A DOUBLE HIS FIRST TIME UP.
COME ON, BRETT!
COME ON!
YOU CAN DO IT!
COME ON, STEPH.
FIRE IT IN THERE.
BURN IT BY HIM.
BLOW THAT SMOKE.
JUST THROW THE BALL, HONEY.
I'M OUT OF CLICHÉS.
COME ON, BRETT!
DON'T LET ME DOWN!
GET 'EM, STEPH!
IT'S A SHOT TO LEFT.
IT'S GOIN'.
IT'S GOIN'.
IT'S GONE!
HOME RUN!
KISS THAT BABY GOOD-BYE.
WAY TO GO!
WHOO!
WAY TO GO, BRETT!
Woman: YAY!
THAT WAS NOT VERY NICE.
DON'T WORRY, STEPH.
WE'LL GET 'EM NEXT TIME.
WELL, THE SCORE IS 1-1 AT THE TOP OF THE FIFTH.
GIANTS HAVE A RUNNER ON THIRD, AND COMING UP TO THE PLATE IS THE GIRL WITH THE GOLDEN ARM, STEPHANIE TANNER.
TAKE THE BLUE ONE.
IT'S PRETTIER.
THANK YOU, BAT GIRL.
JUST DOING MY JOB.
MAKE A HIT, STEPH!
MAKE ME PROUD OF YOU.
COME ON, STEPH.
THAT MEANS "HIT IT," HONEY.
COME ON.
WE GOT A MAN ON THIRD.
BRING HIM HOME.
COME ON!
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE IT, STEPH!
YOU'RE OUT!
SHE WAS SAFE BY A MILE!
WHO'S PAYING YOU TO THROW THIS GAME?
YOU GOT A KID ON THE TEAM?
HUH?
HUH?
HUH?
HUH?
HUH?
JESS.
DON'T MAKE A SCENE.
DANNY, DO SOMETHIN'.
THAT'S THE WORST CALL I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE!
JESS, I WAS STANDING RIGHT THERE.
SHE WAS OUT.
OH.
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU GET US BETTER SEATS?
I CAN'T SEE A THING FROM WHERE WE'RE AT.
COME ON, DEAR.
BE A GOOD BOY, STAY IN YOUR SEAT, AND I'LL BUY YOU A SNOW CONE.
I LIKE CHERRY.
ONCE AGAIN, A REMINDER.
FAMILY MEMBERS ARE PROHIBITED FROM COMING ONTO THE FIELD AND EMBARRASSING THEMSELVES AND THEIR LOVED ONES.
WELL, FOLKS, IT'S ALL COME DOWN TO THIS.
THE SCORE IS 2-1, FAVOR OF TANNER'S GIANTS.
WE'RE IN THE BOTTOM OF THE LAST INNING.
TWO OUT.
RUNNERS ON SECOND AND THIRD, AND STEPPING UP TO THE PLATE IS DANGEROUS BRETT DAVIS.
TANNER'S HAD PROBLEMS STRIKING HIM OUT ALL DAY LONG.
YOU CAN CUT THE TENSION WITH A KNIFE.
YO, BUDDY.
HOT DOG?
ALL RIGHT, STEPH, WE GOT ANOTHER SHOT AT IT.
COME ON, BABY.
YEAH.
STRIKE ONE!
SHE BLEW THAT RIGHT BY HIM.
COME ON, SON!
IT'S ALL UP TO YOU!
PITCH IT TO HIM, STEPH.
RIGHT IN THERE, HONEY.
YEAH!
STRIKE 2!
WELL, THE GIANTS ARE ONE STRIKE AWAY FROM WINNING THIS GAME.
CAN YOU STAND THIS EXCITEMENT?
TIME OUT!
UMP, TIME OUT!
YOU NEED TO TALK TO ME, STEPH?
NOT REALLY.
I NEED TO TALK TO D.J. IT'S A WOMAN THING.
ENOUGH SAID.
D.J.!
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE MANAGER TANNER IS BRINGING IN ANOTHER PITCHER.
NO.
ACTUALLY, HE'S BRINGING IN ANOTHER DAUGHTER.
HERE COMES D.J. TANNER, SHE'S EDITOR OF HER SCHOOL PAPER, LOVES THE MALL, AND SPENDS HOURS IN THE BATHROOM.
JOEY!
SORRY.
DEEJ, TELL HER TO THROW THE TWISTER, OK?
OK.
WHAT IS IT?
THIS IS EMBARRASSING.
I'M IN TROUBLE.
BRETT WANTS ME TO THROW HIM AN EASY ONE SO HE CAN GET A HIT.
OH, I GET IT.
IF YOU STRIKE HIM OUT, YOU MIGHT LOSE A BOYFRIEND.
BUT IF YOU LET HIM GET A HIT, YOU'LL BE LETTING YOUR YOUR WHOLE TEAM DOWN.
TOUGH ONE.
WELL, GOOD LUCK.
D.J., WAIT.
WHAT DO I DO?
WELL, YOU HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT-- SELF-RESPECT OR TRUE LOVE.
THIS WOULD BE A LOT EASIER IF HE WASN'T SUCH A BABE.
PLAY BALL!
ALL RIGHT, FOLKS.
WE'RE FINALLY READY FOR THE MOMENT OF TRUTH.
ONE MORE STRIKE, AND THE GIANTS WIN.
BUT IF BRETT GETS A HIT, THE CUBS COULD WIN.
WHAT A NAIL-BITER.
HEY, NACHOS, OVER HERE.
JUST BRING WHATEVER'S LEFT.
COME ON, BRETT!
COME ON.
YOU CAN DO IT.
ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.
COME ON, BRETT.
WE CAN WIN IT.
UMMH!
STRIKE THREE!
SHE STRUCK HIM OUT!
THE GIANTS WIN THE GAME!
THE GIANTS WIN THE GAME!
THE GIANTS WIN THE GAME!
CAN I GET THIS STUFF TO GO?
YEAH!
WE'RE NUMBER ONE.
WE'RE NUMBER ONE.
WE'RE NUMBER ONE.
WE'RE NUMBER ONE.
WE'RE NUMBER ONE.
WE'RE NUMBER ONE.
COMET, NEXT TIME YOU SEE ME LIKING A BOY, TALK ME OUT OF IT.
HI, STEPH.
BRETT.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I KIND OF FORGOT TO SAY "NICE GAME".
THANKS.
I'M SORRY FOR STRIKING YOU OUT.
BUT THE TEAM WAS COUNTING ON ME.
I UNDERSTAND.
IF I WERE YOU, I WOULD HAVE STRUCK ME OUT, TOO.
REALLY?
YOU'RE NOT MAD AT ME.
NO.
I'M LUCKY YOU'RE NOT MAD AT ME.
I SHOULD NEVER HAVE ASKED MY GIRLFRIEND TO CHEAT FOR ME.
I'M STILL YOUR GIRLFRIEND?
ALL RIGHT!
I MEAN, THAT'S COOL.
SO, WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO NOW?
I DON'T KNOW.
YOU WANT TO GO INSIDE AND WATCH THE SPORTS CHANNEL?
SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.
Comet.
COMETABOUT ME NOT LIKING BOYS ANY MORE, I WAS JUST KIDDING.

KIMMY, WOULD YOU QUIT COPYING MY ESSAY.
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK I'M COPYING YOU?
"WHAT AMERICA MEANS TO ME BY D.J. TANNER".
I AM SICK OF STEPHANIE.
I KNOW THE FEELING.
I WAS TALKING ABOUT MY NAME, GIBBLER.
SOME KID IN SCHOOL TODAY STARTED CALLING ME "STEP ON ME".
NEXT THING I KNEW, MY WHOLE CLASS WAS DOING IT.
I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT CAUGHT ON SO FAST.
THIS COULD BE A CLUE.
HOW RUDE!
I'M GOING TO CHANGE MY NAME TO SOMETHING COOL.
SOMETHING THAT SAYS "ME".
HOW ABOUT AN INDIAN NAME, LIKE "LITTLE PAIN IN NECK"?
WELL, KIMMY, IF WE'RE GOING WITH INDIAN NAMES, THAT WOULD MAKE YOU "BIG HOLE IN HEAD".
HA HA HA, D.J. YOUR PHONE BILL IS SO FUNNY THIS MONTH, I JUST HAD TO SHARE IT WITH YOU.
THE FUNNIEST PART IS THIS $56 CALL TO TOKYO.
START EXPLAINING.
DAD, I DIDN'T CALL TOKYO.
NO?
WELL, SOMEBODY DID.
KIMMY?
I DIDN'T MAKE THAT CALL.
I'VE NEVER BEEN SO INSULTED IN ALL MY LIFE.
YES, YOU HAVE.
I JUST NAILED YOU WITH THAT HOLE-IN-THE-HEAD JOKE.
DON'T YOU REMEMBER?
OF COURSE NOT.
YOU'VE GOT A BIG HOLE IN YOUR HEAD.
HA HA!
THAT'S TWO IN A ROW.
AS SOON AS I THINK OF A COMEBACK, I'M COMING BACK.
WELL, THEN, I GUESS THIS IS GOODBYE FOREVER.
THAT'S THREE IN A ROW.
I KILL MYSELF.
I'M GOING TO L.A. FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS.
SEE YOU GUYS.
JOE, YOU'RE GOING TO L.A. FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS?
WHY ARE YOU GOING TO L.A.?
* ROW, ROW, ROW YOUR BOAT GENTLY DOWN THE STREAM ** MOSHI-MOSHI?
MIKKO-SAN.
MOSHI-MOSHI, DUDE.
MICHELLE-SAN, GENKI DESKA?
GUESS WHAT?
I CAN COUNT TO 100.
JOEY, WHY ARE YOU FLYING TO L.A.?
I JUST HAVE A CRAVING FOR A BAG OF THOSE HONEY-ROASTED PEANUTS THAT THEY GIVE YOU ON THE PLANE.
THAT'S ALL.
YOU'RE FLYING TO L.A. FOR ONE BAG OF NUTS?
DANNY, THAT WOULD BE STUPID.
I GET ANOTHER BAG ON THE WAY BACK.
JOEY, WHY ARE YOU GOING TO L.A WHOOPS, I'D BETTER START OVER.
YOU'RE REALLY IMMATURE.
WHAT'S GOING ON?
HE'S TRYING TO MAKE A RUN FOR IT.
HEAD HIM OFF!
FREEZE, SLIME.
THERE'S NO WAY YOU'RE GETTING OUT AFTER WHAT YOU DID.
WHAT DID HE DO?
HE'S FLYING TO L.A. TO GET HONEY-ROASTED PEANUTS.
COME ON.
DO YOU GUYS HAVE TO KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT MY LIFE?
YES.
YES.
YES.
ALL RIGHT.
I'M GOING TO HOLLYWOOD TO AUDITION FOR A TV PILOT FOR A NEW SITUATION COMEDY.
JOEY, THAT'S GREAT.
THIS IS EXACTLY WHY I DIDN'T WANT TO TELL YOU GUYS.
I KNEW YOU'D GET ALL EXCITED.
CHANCES ARE I WON'T GET IT.
I'LL HAVE TO COME HOME AND TELL YOU.
YOU'LL BEDISAPPOINTED, I'LL BE DISAPPOINTED WHY AM I GOING?
JOEY.
JOEY.
HEY, MAN, WE'RE YOUR FAMILY.
THERE'S NO PRESSURE.
TELL US, WHAT'S THIS NEW SHOW ABOUT?
IT STARS FRANKIE AVALON AND ANNETTE FUNICELLO.
ANNETTE FUNICELLO?
I LOVE HER.
I'VE GOT TO MEET HER.
JOEY, YOU GOT TO GET THIS PART.
BUT, HEY, NO PRESSURE.
WOW, THIS IS SO EXCITING.
FRANKIE AND ANNETTE.
YEAH, THAT'S GREAT.
WHO ARE THEY?
THEY WERE THE STARS OF ALL THOSE CLASSIC BEACH PARTY MOVIES, REMEMBER?
NO.
NO.
FRANKIE HAD ALL THESE HITS LIKE VENUS AND DE-DE-DINAH.
REMEMBER THOSE?
NO.
NO.
YOU REMEMBER ANNETTE.
SHE DID THOSE PEANUT BUTTER COMMERCIALS.
THAT'S RIGHT!
I KNOW HER.
ANNETTE WAS ONE OF THE ORIGINAL MOUSEKETEERS.
JOEY, WHEN YOU MEET HER, TELL HER DANNY TANNER SAYS HELLO.
SHE'LL REMEMBER ME.
I SENT HER A FAN LETTER BACK IN 1968.
DANNY, THERE'S NO WAY.
I'M TELLING YOU, SHE'LL REMEMBER ME.
I WROTE HER A SEVEN PAGE LETTER AND I SPRINKLED IT WITH MY FAVORITE SCENT.
LEMON PLEDGE.
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE PART.
I'M PROBABLY NOT GONNA GET IT.
JOEY, STOP TALKING LIKE THAT.
YOU GOTTA START THINKING POSITIVE.
PICTURE IT,  YOU'RE THE BIGGEST STAR IN AMERICA.
THE JOEY GLADSTONE SHOW HAS JUST GONE TO NUMBER ONE.
YOU COME HOME AFTER A HARD DAY AT THE STUDIO MAKING 200--3--400 MILLION PEOPLE LAUGH.

AT LAKER GAMES, THEY'RE LAKER GIRLS.
THE REST OF THE TIME, THEY'RE JOEY GIRLS.
THANKS, GIRLS.
HIT THE SHOWERS.
JOEY, YOU'RE THE FUNNIEST MAN IN AMERICA.
NO, I'M NOT.
IT'S JOEY GLADSTONE!
EXCUSE ME, EXCUSE ME.
NO PICTURES, PLEASE.
OK, MAYBE JUST ONE.
JOEY, I LOVE YOU!
SECURITY!
THANK YOU, NELSON.
THANK YOU, MANNY.

OH, MY GOD.

HELLO, PRETTY WOMAN.
DINNER TONIGHT IN PARIS?
WHY NOT?
I'M IN THE MOOD FOR FRENCH FRIES.
AW, JOEY, YOU'RE MY HERO.
IN FACT, YOU HAVE THE GREATEST HAIR I'VE EVER SEEN.
I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE HAIR LIKE YOURS-- WHY AM I SAYING THIS?
BECAUSE IT'S MY FANTASY, JESS.
NELSON!
NO, WAIT--NELSON, I'M A SENSITIVE GUY.
NELSON-- WATCH THE HAIR, NELSON.
THE HAIR!
YOU'RE TOUCHING ME, NELSON.
YOU'RE AS FUNNY AS BUGS BUNNY.
YOU'RE AS FUNNY AS BUGS BUNNY.
I'M AS FUNNY AS BUGS BUNNY.
I GOT TO GET TO L.A. WHEN THE LAKER GIRLS GET OUT OF THE SHOWER, TELL THEM I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

HAVE A GOOD TRIP.
GOOD LUCK!
HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?
JOEY'S GOING TO HOLLYWOOD.
SAY GOODBYE.
SAYONARA.
SAYONARA.
SAYONARA?
MICHELLE DID YOU CALL TOKYO?
HAI, DANNY-SAN!
MICHELLE,FROM NOW ON, IF YOU WANT TO CALL TOKYO, YOU CAN MAKE A PRETEND CALL ON THIS PRETEND PHONE.
I'LL BE HAPPY TO PAY THE PRETEND BILLS, OK?
YOU GOT IT, DUDE.
HERE YOU GO.
IS JOEY BACK YET?
NO, BUT I MADE HIM A CAKE.
LOOK AT THIS.
"CONGRATS, JOEY".
THAT'S VERY SWEET, BUT WHAT IF HE DOESN'T GET THE PART?
VERY SIMPLE.
I GET RID OF THIS.
"RATS, JOEY".
MOSHI-MOSHI, MIKKO-SAN.
THIS IS NUTS.
I'M TALKING TO MYSELF.
STEPH, DINNER!
I THINK YOU GUYS OUGHT TO KNOW THAT STEPHANIE IS NOT STEPHANIE ANYMORE.
SHE DECIDED TO CHANGE HER NAME.
OH, DAWN!
COMING!
DAWN?
IT HAS A LOVELY RING TO IT, DON'T YOU THINK?
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOUR REAL NAME?
DAD, NO OFFENSE, BUT HOW CAN YOU COMPARE STEPHANIE WITH DAWN?
I'M BACK!
HEY!
WHAT HAPPENED?
DID YOU GET THE PART?
I DON'T KNOW YET.
I DIDN'T HEAR FROM MY AGENT.
HOW DID THE AUDITION GO?
I DON'T WANT TO PAT MYSELF ON THE BACK OR TOOT MY HORN, BUT   OH, THAT COULD BE MY AGENT.
HELLO, EDDIE.
HELLO, EDDIE!
EDDIE!
COME IN!
JOEY, THAT'S MICHELLE'S PRETEND PHONE.

I'LL BE ON A SHOW WITH FRANKIE AND ANNETTE.
WE'RE ALL GOING TO HOLLYWOOD.
YOU'RE ALL GOING TO SEE ME SHOOT THE PILOT.
YES!
WHOO!
JOEY, HOW'S IT GOING?
SORRY, NO AUTOGRAPHS, PLEASE.
HOW SOON THEY FORGET THE LITTLE PEOPLE.
ALL RIGHT, I'LL SIGN YOUR BOOKS.
OKAY, WHAT WERE YOUR NAMES AGAIN?
OH, MY GOD, IT'S ANNETTE FUNICELLO.
SHE LOOKS JUST AS BEAUTIFUL AS SHE DID ON THE MICKEY MOUSE CLUB.
THAT LADY KNOWS MICKEY MOUSE?
GIVE ME MY BOOK BACK.
EXCUSE ME, ARE YOU ANNETTE FUNNY JELLO?
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
HI, SWEETHEART.
UH, EXCUSE ME.
MICHELLE, MISS FUNICELLO'S GETTING READY FOR HER SHOW.
YOU GO BACK OVER THERE, HONEY.
YOU SHOULDN'T BE BOTHERING HER.
HI, IT'S SO NICE TO MEET YOU.
I'VE LOVED YOU EVER SINCE THE FIRST TIME I SAW YOU GO, "ANNETTE".
ACTUALLY WE DID IT * BUM PUM BUM PUM BUM ** ANNETTE.
OH.
* BUM POM BUM POM BUM ** DANNY.
THAT'S IT!
I MEAN, HI, I'M DANNY TANNER.
HI.
WAIT A MINUTE.
DANNY TANNER.
DIDN'T YOU WRITE ME A FAN LETTER IN 1968 THAT SMELLED LIKE LEMON PLEDGE?
YES.
THAT WAS ME.
I KNEW YOU'D REMEMBER.
IT WAS THE ONLY TIME A FAN OFFERED TO CLEAN MY HOUSE.
THAT OFFER STILL STANDS.
WOW.
LOOK HOW STAR-STRUCK DANNY IS.
HE'S PRACTICALLY DROOLING OVER ANNETTE.
HEY, GANG!
EVERYBODY READY TO ROCK 'N' ROLL?
AAH!
IT'S FRANKIE.

OH, I ALWAYS CONDITION WITH AVOCADOS.
OH, ME, TOO.
ME, TOO.
ONCE IN A WHILE I PUT IN A LITTLE MAYONNAISE.
NO, TRY OUGHT TO TRY A LITTLE BIT OF LIME JUICE AND CILANTRO.
DOES THAT HELP RESTORE THE pH BALANCE?
NO, BUT IT MAKES A GREAT DIP.
FRANKIE, ANNETTE, I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET D.J., MICHELLE, AND DAWN.
DAWN ARIEL TANNER.
OK, PLACES, PLEASE.

IN 5, 4, 3, 2  WOW, FRANKIE, ISN'T THIS WONDERFUL?
WE FINALLY HAVE OUR OWN HANGOUT AT THE BEACH.
YEAH, ANNETTE, AND NOW WE CAN ENTERTAIN A WHOLE NEW GENERATION OF SURFERS.
IF THEY'D JUST COME OUT OF THE WATER.
I CAN TAKE CARE OF THAT.
WATCH THIS.
SHARK!
WOULD EVERYONE LIKE TO HEAR A SONG?
YEAH!
HEY, I GOT IT.
HOW ABOUT ONE OF THOSE GREAT OLD LOVE SONGS?

IT'S ALL RIGHT, MICHELLE.
I'M JUST ACTING.
JUST CHECKING!
OKAY, LET'S TAKE IT FROM JOEY'S FACE IN THE SAND.
OH GREAT, I WAS HOPING WE COULD TAKE IT FROM THERE.
OKAY.
HERE WE GO.
IN 3, 2 WAY TO GO, FLIP.
YOU JUST CLEARED OUT ALL OF OUR CUSTOMERS.
OH, SORRY TO BE SUCH A BUMMER, FRANKIE.
HERE, CHECK OUT THIS LETTER.
THIS'LL GET YOU STOKED.
IT'S FROM THE BEACH BOYS.
THEY WANT YOU TO BE A PART OF THEIR HAWAII SHOW.
FLIP, DID YOU READ THIS LETTER?
WELL, MOST OF IT.
I HAD SOME HELP WITH THE BIG WORDS.
WE'RE GOING TO HAWAII?
THAT MEANS THE BIG KAHUNA SURFS AGAIN.
COWABUNGA!
SWEETHEART, YOU'RE GROWN UP NOW.
PLEASE DON'T SAY COWABUNGA.
IF WE GO TO HAWAII, WHO'S GOING TO RUN THE RESTAURANT?
DUH, I COULD DO IT.
WAIT A MINUTE.
ANNETTE.
HE COULD-- I DON'T KNOW IF WE SHOULD TRUST HIM.
BONJOUR, MONSIEUR DUDE.
WELCOME TO FRANKIE AND ANNETTE'S.
MAY I SUGGEST YOU SCARF DOWN A TOTALLY RADICAL BURGER?
BUT, FLIP, DON'T YOU HAVE TO DELIVER THESE LETTERS?
NAW.
I CAN JUST MAIL THEM.
I SAY WE GIVE FLIP A CHANCE.
WHAT COULD GO WRONG?
RIGHT.
HEY, DO YOU GUYS SMELL SOMETHING BURNING?
FLIP, YOU'RE SITTING ON THE GRILL.
THEN THAT WOULD EXPLAIN THE SEARING PAIN.
YEOW!
LIKE TOTALLY RADICAL RUMP ROAST.
WHEW.
DAWN.
YEAH, DAD?
I THOUGHT WE SHOULD HAVE A LITTLE TALK BEFORE WE GO DOWN TO THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF NAME CHANGES AND LEGALLY CHANGE YOUR NAME.
ARE YOU ABSOLUTELY SURE YOU NEVER WANT TO BE STEPHANIE AGAIN?
ABSOLUTELY.
THE KIDS DON'T CALL ME "STEP ON ME" ANYMORE.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO WHEN THEY START MAKING FUN OF YOUR NEW NAME?
HOW COULD THEY POSSIBLY MAKE FUN OF A NAME AS BEAUTIFUL AS DAWN?
OH, I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE THEY COULD CALL YOU DAWNALD DUCK.
OR THEY COULD SAY DAWNER AND BLITZEN.
THEY COULD ALL CROWD YOU AND START SINGING-- * DAWN DA DA DA DA DA DAWN DAWN DAWN * * DAWN DA DA DA DAWN DA DA DAWN DAWN DAWN * * DA DA DAWN DA DA DAWN DA DA DAWN DAWN DAWN * * DA DA DAWN DA DA DAWN DAWN DAWN ** DAD, DAD.
UH NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT, I THINK I'LL STICK WITH STEPHANIE.
GOOD,I WAS HOPING THAT THOUGHT WOULD DAWN ON YOU.
I'M SORRY.
I'M ALL DAWN NOW.
DANNY!
QUICK, TURN ON THE TV.
I JUST TALKED TO MY AGENT.
HOLLYWOOD INSIDER IS DOING A SEGMENT ON SURF'S UP!
WE'RE GONNA FIND OUT IF IT'S GONNA BE A NEW SERIES.
BOTH MADONNA AND ANDY GRIFFITH HAVE DENIED THIS RUMOR.
TURNING TO TELEVISION, OUR NETWORK SOURCES HAVE CONFIRMED THAT THE NEW COMEDY SERIES SURF'S UP!
, STARRING FRANKIE AVALON, ANNETTE FUNICELLO, AND NEWCOMER JOEY GLADSTONE, WILL DEFINITELY BE ON THE FALL SCHEDULE.
HOWEVER, HOLLYWOOD INSIDER HAS THE INSIDE STORY.
OBVIOUSLY RIDING THE COATTAILS OF THE SUCCESS OF THE SIMPSONS, THE NETWORK HAS DECIDED TO CHANGE SURF'S UP!
FROM A HALF-HOUR SITCOM TO A HALF-HOUR CARTOON.
FRANKIE AND ANNETTE WILL NOW BE SINGING DOLPHINS.
AND JOEY GLADSTONE, THE SURFING MAILMAN, WILL BECOME A SURFING KANGAROO.
OHH.
BUT FRANKIE, ANNETTE, AND JOEY WILL BE DOING THE VOICES FOR THE CARTOON CHARACTERS.
ALL RIGHT.
FIRST WE'RE HAPPY, THEN WE'RE SAD, THEN WE'RE HAPPY.
WHAT'S GOING ON?
ALL MY LIFE I'VE WANTED TO BE A CARTOON.
NOW I AM A CARTOON.
I'M GOING TO BE THE VOICE OF FLIP, THE SURFING KANGAROO.
THERE'S ONLY ONE PROBLEM.
I DON'T DO A VOICE OF A SURFING KANGAROO.
IT'S SIMPLE.
YOU DO THAT WOODCHUCK CHARACTER, SO DO THAT, THEN YOU DO A SURFER CHARACTER, PUT THOSE BOTH TOGETHER, ADD AN AUSTRALIAN ACCENT, AND "BADA-BING" YOU GOT YOURSELF A SURFING KANGAROO.
SIMPLE.
WELL, LET'S SEE.
GOOD DAY, MATE.
I'M FLIP, THE SURFING KANGAROO.
HA HA HA HA.
WHAT DO YOU SAY WE PUT ANOTHER KEN ON THE BARBIE?
SAY, IS THAT SURFBOARD MADE OF WOOD?
I LOVE CARTOONS!
THIS IS GREAT!
HUG-UG-UG-UG.
WHOA!
BOY, LOOK, ROCK, IT'S UNBELIEVABLE STUFF, STUFF, STUFF.
HOLD ON, BOY.

GUYS HAVE NO IDEA THAT NATURAL BEAUTY TAKES SO MUCH HARD WORK.
WELL, SOME GUYS DO.
THIS MORNING, YOUR UNCLE JESSE SPENT FIXING HIS HAIR.
HE SPRAYED IT, HE MOUSSED IT, HE GELLED IT.
I THINK HE EVEN USED MY HOT ROLLERS.
THERE.
OK.
DONE.
THANKS, AUNT BECKY.
UH-OH.
I HAVE TO BE OUT OF HERE IN 10 MINUTES.
WAIT.
I HAVE A BETTER IDEA.
FOLLOW ME.
OK.
GIVE ME YOUR FEET.
OH, YOU'RE A GENIUS.
THIS WORKS GREAT.
DEEJ, YOU MUST HAVE REALLY HAIRY FEET.
IT'S FOR MY NAIL POLISH.
IS EVERYTHING SET UP FOR TONIGHT?
ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS IN FRONT OF THE A-D-U-L-T?
IT'S TIMES LIKE THIS I SURE WISH I KNEW HOW TO SPELL.
KIMMY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO HIDE ANYTHING FROM AUNT BECKY.
SHE'S LIKE MY BIG SISTER.
YEAH.
YOU CAN TELL ME ANYTHING.
OK.
HERE'S THE PLAN.
I START BABYSITTING AT 7:00.
I'LL HAVE THE KID IN BED BY 7:02.
PERFECT.
AND THE GUYS ARE COMING AT 7:10.
AUNT BECKY, THERE'S THIS REALLY CUTE GUY NAMED RYAN IN MY BIOLOGY CLASS, AND WE SHARE THE SAME MICROSCOPE.
THEY MET OVER A DROP OF POND SCUM.
IT GETS BETTER.
I INVITED RYAN OVER TO STUDY FOR FINALS WITH US.
HE'S EVEN BRINGING A FRIEND FOR KIMMY.
DEEJ, HOW DOES YOUR DAD FEEL ABOUT YOU INVITING BOYS OVER TO A HOUSE WITHOUT ANY ADULTS?
WELL, DAD FEELS FINE BECAUSE DAD DOESN'T KNOW.
YOU WON'T SAY ANYTHING, WILL YOU?
NO, I GUESS NOT.
THANKS, AUNT BECKY.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
HEY, HAVE YOU GUYS SEEN JOEY?
UH-UH.
BOY, UNCLE JESSE, YOU'RE HAVING A REALLY GOOD HAIR DAY.
REALLY?
YEAH.
I GUESS I AM.
IT'S FUNNY, TOO BECAUSE I JUST WOKE UP THIS MORNING AND RAN MY FINGERS THROUGH IT.
JUST BLESSED, I GUESS.
HURRY, HURRY!
COMET'S HAVING PUPPIES!
WHAT?
COMET'S HAVING PUPPIES?
WAIT A SECOND.
COMET IS A BOY.
* HA HA HA HA HA * * I FOOLED YOU ** MICHELLE, SIT DOWN.
LET ME TELL YOU A STORY ABOUT A LITTLE GIRL WHO WAS WATCHING SHEEP, AND SHE LIKED TO FOOL PEOPLE BY CRYING WOLF.
BUT THEN, THE REAL WOLF CAME, NOBODY BELIEVED HER.
OK.
TELL ME THE STORY.
I JUST DID.
NO ONCE UPON A TIME?
NO HAPPY EVER AFTER?
DUMB STORY.
WHY DO I BOTHER?
WELL, HERE IT IS, BOYS-- THE NEWEST ADDITION TO OUR PRODUCTION COMPANY.
TA-DA!
HA!
A POOL TABLE.
ALL RIGHT, JOSEPH.
NOW THIS IS A REAL OFFICE.
ALL WE GOT TO DO NOW IS GET RID OF THE DESK AND MAKE ROOM FOR THE WATER SLIDE.
IT JUST SO HAPPENS I RENTED THIS POOL TABLE TO ENHANCE OUR CREATIVITY.
JESS, YOU KNOW HOW SOMETIMES WE GET STUCK FOR AN IDEA, WHAT DO WE USUALLY DO?
THROW SPITWADS AT EACH OTHER.
NOT ANY MORE.
FROM NOW ON, WE PLAY POOL, BUT IT'S ONLY TO BE USED IN THOSE RARE MOMENTS WHEN WE'RE STUCK FOR AN IDEA.
RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, LET'S GET SOME WORK DONE.
I'M STUCK.
ME, TOO.
RACK 'EM UP.
DO YOU GUYS MIND IF I PLAY, TOO?
AW, ISN'T THAT CUTE?
DANNY WANTS TO PLAY POOL WITH THE BIG BOYS.
DANIEL, POOL IS A GAME OF SKILL, NERVE, AND COORDINATION.
YOU KEEP SCORE.
OH, BOY.
DO I GET CHALK AND EVERYTHING?
YES.
THESE ARE THE COLORED BALLS.
THESE ARE THE POCKETS.
WHEN WE GET ONE OF THE COLORED BALLS INTO THE POCKET, YOU RUN OVER HERE-- COME HERE PUT A LITTLE LINE LIKE THAT.
JUST LIKE THAT.
OKAY?
THERE YOU GO.
THERE'S YOUR CHALK.
OOH, THANKS.
THIS IS MUCH MORE FUN THAN PLAYING.
DADDY, COME HERE!
HURRY UP!
COMING, MICHELLE.
BE RIGHT BACK.
I'M COMING!
WHAT IS IT, MICHELLE?
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
THERE'S A MOUSE OVER THERE AND HE HAS BIG TEETH LIKE THIS.
A MOUSE?
BUT THERE'S NO CRUMBS ON MY FLOOR.
THAT'S COMMON KNOWLEDGE IN THE RODENT WORLD.
DAD?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
OH.
MICHELLE SAW A MOUSE.
OH, YEAH?
WAS IT HAVING PUPPIES?
* HA HA HA HA HA * * I FOOLED YOU ** MICHELLE, IT'S NOT NICE TO TRY AND FOOL YOUR DAD LIKE THAT.
I TOLD HER THE STORY ABOUT THE LITTLE GIRL WHO CRIED WOLF.
I DIDN'T CRY WOLF.
I CRIED MOUSE.
* HA HA HA HA HA * MICHELLE, THAT'S REALLY NOT FUNNY.
HI, DAD.
BYE, DAD.
I'LL BE BABYSITTING WITH KIMMY.
WHOA, WHOA.
D.J. YOUR BIOLOGY FINAL IS MONDAY.
RELAXEZ-VOUS, MR.
T. SHE'LL BE STUDYING WITH ME.
THAT'S TRES REASSURING.
HEY.
I KNOW BIOLOGY.
THEY MADE ME TAKE IT TWICE.
D.J., YOU'RE STUDYING IN YOUR ROOM TONIGHT.
BUT DAD, WE HAD THIS ALL PLANNED.
YOU DIDN'T PLAN IT WITH ME.
BECKY, DON'T YOU THINK MY DAD'S BEING UNFAIR?
DEEJ, EVEN IF I DID AGREE WITH YOU, IT'S REALLY NOT MY PLACE-- BECKY AGREES WITH ME.
THAT'S NOT WHAT SHE JUST SAID.
IS IT, BECKY?
WELL, NO.
NOT EXACTLY.
WHAT I MEANT WAS-- SEE, DEEJ?
SHE AGREES WITH ME.
I'M JUST GOING TO GO WAIT OVER THERE.
D.J., MY POINT IS, IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO GET GOOD GRADES.
THERE COMES A TIME IN EVERY PERSON'S LIFE WHEN YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN EXCELLENCE ANDLESS THAN EXCELLENCE.
THE CHOICE IS YOURS.
GREAT.
I'M GOING WITH KIMMY.
OK.
THE CHOICE IS MINE.
YOU'RE STUDYING IN YOUR ROOM TONIGHT.
CASE CLOSED.
AU REVOIR, KIMMY.
DEEJ, THIS IS AWFUL.
I'M GOING TO BE STUCK ALL ALONE WITH THOSE TWO CUTE GUYS.
ALL RIGHT!
CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS?
RYAN'S GOING TO THINK I STOOD HIM UP.
HE'S GONNA HATE ME FOREVER.
CALL HIM AND TELL HIM WHAT HAPPENED.
IT'S TOO LATE.
HE'S ALREADY ON HIS WAY.
I HAVE TO EXPLAIN THIS IN PERSON.
IF YOU SAW HOW CUTE HE WAS, YOU'D WANT TO EXPLAIN THIS IN PERSON, TOO.
CAN YOU COVER FOR ME?
OH, DEEJ, YOUR DAD SAID NO.
COME ON, BECKY.
PLEASE?
I'LL ONLY BE 10 MINUTES.
I PROMISE.
YOU SAID WE WERE FRIENDS.
ALL RIGHT.
10 MINUTES.
THANKS, BECKY.
YOU'RE THE BEST.
GO!
BE BACK IN 10 MINUTES, OR YOU'RE IN BIG TROUBLE.
AND SO AM I.  HI.
DEEJ.
THE WARDEN LET YOU OUT?
NOT EXACTLY.
MY DAD THINKS I'M IN MY ROOM STUDYING, BUT BECKY'S GONNA COVER FOR ME.
I ONLY HAVE 10 MINUTES.
I HOPE RYAN'S NOT LATE.
I WONDER WHO HE'S BRINGING FOR ME.
I DON'T KNOW, BUT RYAN SAID HE WAS DEFINITELY YOUR TYPE.
EXCELLENT.
THAT MEANS HE'S 6'2", DRIVES A RED LAMBORGHINI, AND KNOWS HOW TO MAKE ME FEEL LIKE A WOMAN.
PARTY!
PARTY!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP?
I WANT TO WATCH ARACHNOPHOBIA.
AARON, I KNOW YOU CAN'T TELL TIME YET, BUT IT'S WAY PAST YOUR BEDTIME.
LIAR!
I LEARNED HOW TO TELL TIME LAST WEEK!
IT'S ONLY OKAY, AARON.
YOU LEAVE ME NO CHOICE BUT TO SING YOU ANOTHER LULLABY.
NO!
PLEASE!
ROCKABYE BABY, ON THE TREE TOP!
MY EARS!
MY EARS!
WHEN THE WIND BLOWS, THE CRADLE WILL ROCK!
IT'S THE GUYS.
I'VE ONLY GOT EIGHT MINUTES TO START A DEEP, MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIP WITH RYAN.
HI, RYAN.
HI, GIBBLER.
HEY, DEEJ.
YOU LOOK DIFFERENT OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL.
I MEAN, YOU LOOK REALLY PRETTY.
THANKS.
YOU LOOK REALLY PRETTY, TOO.
I MEANREALLY PRETTY MASCULINE.
WHERE IS HE?
WHERE'S THE HUNK OF MY DREAMS?
GIBBLER.
BITTERMAN?
I GUESS YOU TWO KNOW EACH OTHER.
SINCE THIRD GRADE.
HE USED TO EAT MY PASTE.
COME ON, GIBBLER.
YOU KNOW YOU LOVE ME.
EXCUSE ME WHILE I BARF.
HEY.
THOSE ARE BOYS.
YOU'RE FIRED, GIBBLER.
YOU CAN'T FIRE ME.
I QUIT.
KIMMY, YOU'RE BABYSITTING.
YOU CAN'T QUIT.
AARON,WHAT IF WE LET YOU STAY UP LATE AND WATCH ARACHNOPHOBIA IN YOUR PARENTS' BEDROOM?
THAT'S A BRIBE!
YES, IT IS.
I LIKE BRIBES.
HEY.
WHY DON'T WE BREAK UP INTO STUDY GROUPS?
I'LL WORK WITH D.J. JAKE, WORK WITH GIBBLER.
THE DREAM TEAM.

I BELIEVE THAT'S HEY, TALK ABOUT BEGINNER'S LUCK.
YOU HUSTLED ME, MAN.
I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE HUSTLING YOU.
I'M GLAD YOU APPRECIATE THE IRONY.
THANK YOU.
JOEY, HERE'S $10 FOR KEEPING YOUR MOUTH SHUT.

WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SOMETHING?
BECAUSE I JUST MADE YOU GOT TO GIVE ME A CHANCE TO GET EVEN.

ALL THE ICE CREAM DISAPPEARED!
CALL THE POLICE.
THIS IS AN EMERGENCY.
WHAT'S SO FUNNY?
* HA HA HA HA HA * * I FOOLED YOU ** THE ICE CREAM IS HIDDEN RIGHT OVER HERE IN THIS DUCK.
THAT WAS A VERY MEAN TRICK.
I'M SORRY, BUT I HAD TO TEACH YOU A LESSON.
NOW, YOU'LL NEVER FOOL ANYONE AGAIN.
RIGHT, MICHELLE?
RIGHT.
NOW START SCOOPING.
HI, GIRLS.
UH, DANNY, THROUGH PLAYING POOL?
YEAH.
JOEY AND JESSE ARE DOWN THERE SPINNING IN CHAIRS FOR QUARTERS.
I WAS KIND OF TOUGH ON D.J. TONIGHT.
I THINK I'D BETTER GO TALK TO HER.
NO.
DON'T.
BAD IDEA.
KIDS AT THAT AGE, THEY'LL TUNE YOU RIGHT OUT.
YOU'LL TALK AND TALK AND TALK, AND IT'LL BE LIKE SHE'S NOT EVEN THERE.
BECKY, DO YOU KNOW SOMETHING I DON'T?
YES, I DO.
THE GESTATION PERIOD OF AN ELEPHANT IS 22 MONTHS.
ACTUALLY, I KNEW THAT.
DID YOU ALSO KNOW D.J.'S NOT UPSTAIRS?
NOW, THAT I DIDN'T KNOW.
DID SHE GO OUT WITH KIMMY AFTER I TOLD HER NOT TO?
I'M SORRY, DANNY.
I SORT OF TOLD HER SHE COULD.
BECKY, WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?
I WAS JUST TRYING TO BE HER FRIEND.
AND SHE JUST NEEDED ALTHOUGH THAT WAS HALF AN HOUR AGO.
THERE GOES D.J.!
D.J. IS OUTSIDE?
WHERE?
MICHELLE, DIDN'T YOU JUST LEARN NOT TO MAKE UP STORIES?
THIS TIME I MADE UP THE TRUTH.
MICHELLE, IT'S OVER.
GIVE IT UP.
THERE SHE GOES AGAIN!
THAT IS D.J. I'M WAITING.
OK.
I'M SORRY.
I LOVE TO BE RIGHT.
I THINK I'M GONNA GO HAVE THAT LITTLE TALK WITH D.J. RIGHT NOW.
HELLO, HONEY.
OH, HI, DAD.
I WAS JUST COMING DOWNSTAIRS TO STUDY.
THE LIGHTING'S SO MUCH BETTER.
D.J., I KNOW WHAT YOU'VE BEEN UP TO.
EXACTLY HOW MUCH DO YOU KNOW?
LYING, SNEAKING OUT, MEETING BOYS.
DAD, WHERE DID WE GO WRONG WITH HER?
I KNOW, I KNOW.
I'M OUT OF HERE.
BECKY, YOU TOLD ON ME?
DEEJ, WHY DON'T YOU GO ON UP TO YOUR ROOM AND GET COMFORTABLE.
YOU'RE GOING TO BE THERE FOR A WHILE.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY FRIEND.
DEEJ, WAIT.
DANNY, LET ME TALK TO HER.
OK.
BUT I'M NEXT.
BECKY, DON'T BE SO HARD ON YOURSELF.
WHEN TEENAGERS REALLY WANT SOMETHING, THEY HAVE A WAY OF BREAKING US DOWN.
I'LL GET STRONGER, DANNY.
I PROMISE.
WHAT?
DEEJ YOU AND I NEED TO TALK.
ABOUT WHAT?
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.
YOU KNOW, DEEJ, YOU PROMISED YOU'D COME HOME IN 10 MINUTES AND YOU DIDN'T.
YOU PROMISED THAT YOU WOULDN'T TELL MY DAD.
D.J., YOU TOOK ADVANTAGE OF OUR FRIENDSHIP.
I GUESS I DID.
BUT RYAN AND I WERE REALLY GETTING ALONG.
I FIGURED YOU'D COVER FOR ME.
HONEY, I LOVE YOU, AND I LOVE THAT WE CAN SPEND TIME TOGETHER AND THAT WE CAN SHARE SECRETS, BUT NOW THAT I'M LIVING HERE, I'M AFRAID THERE ARE TIMES WHEN I'M GONNA HAVE TO BE A RESPONSIBLE ADULT.
IT'S A FLAW IN ME YOU'LL HAVE TO ACCEPT.
WELL, NOBODY'S PERFECT.
I'M REALLY SORRY, AUNT BECKY.
I'M SORRY, TOO.
I THINK I'D BETTER GO DOWNSTAIRS AND APOLOGIZE TO DAD.
OH, WAIT.
ONE QUESTION.
HOW DID IT GO TONIGHT WITH RYAN?
WELL, ONCE KIMMY LOCKED BITTERMAN IN THE CLOSET, IT WAS SMOOTH SAILING.
DID YOU GET ANY STUDYING DONE?
YEAH, I STUDIED-- STUDIED HIS EYES, HIS HAIR, HIS CUTE LITTLE DIMPLES.
TOO BAD THAT STUFF'S NOT ON THE TEST.
IT IS TOO BAD.
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO VERY WELL IF YOU DON'T HIT THOSE BOOKS.

AND THERE'S MORE.
ARE THESE BOWLING SHOES?
WELL, OPEN 'EM UP AND FIND OUT.
WOW!
MY FIRST PAIR OF HIGH HEELS!
THANKS, EVERYBODY.
YOU'RE WELCOME, HONEY.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
WHAT THE HECK IS THAT?
D.J.!
YOUNG LADY, YOU ARE NOT THE ONLY ONE IN THIS HOUSE.
OH!
KIRSTEN!
OH, WHOA, DANNY.
YOU SOUNDED JUST LIKE MY DAD.
I DID?
WELL, MAYBE THAT'S BECAUSE I AM A DAD.
AND THAT'S HOW DADS SOUND WHEN THEY TALK TO KIDS.
I JUST CAME BY EARLY TO GIVE D.J. THIS TAPE.
I THOUGHT YOU AND I COULD GET SOME PIZZA BEFORE THE DANCE.
DEEJ, COULD I TALK TO KIRSTEN FOR A MINUTE?
SURE.
I'LL GO WORK ON MY SPEECH.
KIRSTEN, YOU HAVE TO TELL ME WHERE YOU BUY YOUR CLOTHES.
HEY, NEXT TIME I GO SHOPPING, WE'LL GO TOGETHER.
THIS IS GREAT!
I FINALLY HAVE A FRIEND WITH A CAR.
LOOK, UH, KIRSTEN, UM I WANT YOU TO KNOW I REALLY THINK YOU'RE A WONDERFUL GIRL-- I MEAN WOMAN.
I MEANPERSON.
BUT, LOOK, YOU'RE 21, AND I'M 33.
ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE ME AGAIN?
NO!
NO, NO.
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
YES.
AGE DOESN'T MATTER.
I REALLY LIKE YOU A LOT.
I LIKE YOU, TOO.
BUT I HAVEN'T BEEN COMPLETELY HONEST WITH YOU.
I'M NOT REALLY A SLAUGHTERHEAD.
AND I HATED SNEAKING INTO THAT CONCERT.
I MAILED THEM A CHECK TODAY.
THE TRUTH IS, YOU AND I, WE HAVE VERY DIFFERENT INTERESTS.
I WAS HOPING YOU'D UNDERSTAND AND WE COULD STILL BE FRIENDS.
I'D LIKE THAT, TOO.
BUT BEFORE WE'RE JUST FRIENDS BYE, DANNY.
* YOUNG GIRL, GET OUT OF MY MIND * * MY LOVE FOR YOU IS WAY OUT OF LINE * * BETTER RUN, GIRL * * YOU'RE MUCH TOO YOUNG, GIRL * DAD, ARE YOU GOING THROUGH SOME KIND OF CRISIS?
MINI-CRISIS.
BUT, UH, I'LL BE FINE.
WELL, LOOK AT YOU IN YOUR CAP AND GOWN.
I CAN'T BELIEVE MY LITTLE BABY'S FINALLY GRADUATING.
WELL, NOT TILL TOMORROW.
I'M JUST PRACTICING READING MY SPEECH WITH THE TASSEL IN MY FACE.
YOU WANT TO HEAR IT?
SURE, HONEY.
"TODAY, AS WE SAY GOOD-BYE "TO VAN ATTA JUNIOR HIGH, "WE REALIZE THAT EVERYTHING UP UNTIL NOW "HAS BEEN BUT PREPARATION FOR THE FUTURE.
"FINALLY WE'RE READY TO ENTER HIGH SCHOOL, AND OUR LIVES ARE ABOUT TO BEGIN".
WHAT DO YOU THINK SO FAR?
WELLI'M JUST CURIOUS, BUT WHAT ABOUT THE LAST 14 YEARS?
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE SAYING YOUR LIFE HASN'T EVEN STARTED YET.
WELL, IT HASN'T.
BUT WHEN I GET INTO HIGH SCHOOL, I GET TO GO OUT ON DATES, STAY UP REALLY LATE, BACKPACK ACROSS EUROPE WITH MY BOYFRIEND.
WAIT--WAIT A MINUTE.
WE'LL--WE'LL FIGHT ABOUT THAT PART LATER.
MY POINT IS, DON'T MISS OUT ON WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW JUST 'CAUSE YOU'RE WAITING FOR SOMETHING BETTER TO COME ALONG.
YOU CAN'T LIVE FOR THE FUTURE JUST LIKE YOU CAN'T LIVE IN THE PAST.
WELL, I'M NOT LIVING IN THE PAST.
OH, I KNOW YOU'RE NOT.
BUT I WAS.
I WAS TRYIN' TO PRETEND I WAS 21 AGAIN.
I WAS PRETTY SILLY, HUH?
WELL, I HAVE TO ADMIT KIMMY AND I WERE LAUGHING AT YOU IN THOSE NEON PANTS FOR HOURS.
DAD, CHECK OUT THESE HEELS.
YOU CAN'T BELIEVE HOW COOL IT IS UP HERE.
THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL, HONEY.
DO I SMELL CHOCOLATE CAKE?
YES, YOU DO.
WEREN'T YOU IN YOUR BED SOUND ASLEEP?
MY NOSE WOKE ME UP.
GET OVER HERE.
OHHHMMM.
YOU KNOW, GIRLS, I MAY NOT BE 21 ANYMORE, BUT 33 IS FEELIN' PRETTY GOOD RIGHT NOW.
CAN LIFE BE ANY BETTER THAN THIS?
IT WOULD BE BETTER IF I HAD SOME CHOCOLATE CAKE.
OK.
I JUST HAPPEN TO HAVE AN ENTIRE CAKE HERE.

HE'S GOT QUITE A GRIP.
SPEAKING OF GRIPS, YOU BOYS BETTER GET ONE.
HEY, IT'S PERFECTLY NORMAL FOR YOUNG CHILDREN TO HAVE IMAGINARY FRIENDS.
WHEN D.J. WAS A KID, SHE HAD AN IMAGINARY DUCK NAMED NORTON.
A DUCK.
HEY, NORTON WAS JUST A PHASE.
I GREW OUT OF IT.
THAT'S TRUE.
SHE FORGOT ALL ABOUT NORTON WHEN SHE MADE FRIENDS WITH KIMMY.
MAN, I MISS THAT DUCK.
YOU'LL BE SORRY WHEN I'M GONE, MR.
T. HOW WOULD I KNOW?
YOU NEVER LEAVE.
I'LL GET IT.
HELLO?
OH.
OK.
D.J., IT'S NORTON THE DUCK.
HA HA!
I QUACK MYSELF UP.
STEPH, HONEY, IS THAT FOR ME?
YEAH.
IT'S DR.
CRANE'S OFFICE.
OH, GREAT.
IT'S ABOUT TIME.
HELLO.
YOU'RE KIDDING.
YOU'RE KIDDING!
YOU'RE KIDDING!
HE'S KIDDING.
WELL, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!
OH, BOY.
OH, BOY.
OH BEEF JERKY, ANYBODY?
BECKY, COULD I TALK TO YOU FOR A SECOND, PLEASE?
WELL, SURE, DANNY.
I ALSO HAVE RANCH-FLAVORED.
HEY, I WANT TO COME, TOO.
WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR?
LET'S EAVESDROP.
OK, BECKY, LET'S REVIEW.
YOU WENT TO THE DOCTOR.
HE CALLED RIGHT BACK.
YOU SAID, "THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU"!
AND YOU'VE BEEN LIVING ON BEEF JERKY FOR THE LAST 3 DAYS.
IT DOESN'T TAKE A GENIUS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.
YEAH, SHE'S OBVIOUSLY IRON-DEFICIENT.
AND YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY BRAIN-DEFICIENT.
JOEY, REBECCA IS PREGNANT.
PREGNANT?
SHH!
PREGNANT?
PREGNANT?
WHO'S PREGNANT?
UHI AM.
WAY TO GO, JOEY!
GIRLS, I'M GOING TO HAVE A BABY.
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A BABY?
BE QUIET.
JESSE'S UPSTAIRS, AND HE STILL DOESN'T KNOW.
WELL, I'LL TELL HIM.
FOLLOW ME, EVERYONE.
OH, WAIT A MINUTE!
HOLD IT.
HOLD IT.
NOBODY IS SAYING A WORD ABOUT ME BEING PREGNANT.
YOU KNOW, EVENTUALLY HE WILL FIND OUT.
I'M GOING TO TELL HIM TONIGHT OVER A ROMANTIC CANDLELIGHT DINNER.
SO PROMISE ME YOU WON'T SAY A WORD, OK?
SURE.
PROMISE.
GLEN WANTS TO KNOW WHERE BABIES COME FROM.
UH CLEVELAND.
MICHELLE WE TALKED ABOUT HOW BABIES COME FROM MOMMIES' TUMMIES.
GLEN WANTS TO KNOW WHERE THE BABIES SLEEP IN THERE.
WELL, THE--THE BABY SLEEPS IN KIND OF A LITTLE COZY WATERBED.
OH.
TELL GLEN IF HE HAS ANY MORE QUESTIONS, HE SHOULD ASK HIS INVISIBLE PARENTS, OK?
LET'S GO FINISH LUNCH.
HEY, BECK, IS SOMETHING WRONG?
I'M JUST A LITTLE NERVOUS ABOUT HOW JESSE'S GOING TO TAKE THE NEWS.
I MEAN, WE'VE TALKED ABOUT HAVING A BABY, BUT NOT FOR A COUPLE MORE YEARS.
I'M SURE JESSE IS GOING TO BE THRILLED.
I HOPE SO.
BOY, IT'S TOO BAD YOU'RE NOT AN ELEPHANT.
YOU KNOW, ELEPHANTS, THEY'RE PREGNANT FOR TWO YEARS.
BY THE TIME LITTLE DUMBO POPS OUT, YOU'RE RIGHT ON SCHEDULE.
LITTLE GUY, YOU KNOW AROO!
WHERE'S BECKY AND JOEY?
OH, THEY'RE IN THERE.
JOEY, BECK, COME HERE.
I WANT YOU GUYS ALL TO HEAR THIS.
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN.
THE PRESIDENT OF THE RECORD COMPANY HEARD MY DEMO AND WANTS TO MEET ME.
THAT'S GREAT.
SEE YOU GUYS LATER.
JESSE, WE ALL JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT WE'RE REALLY, REALLY HAPPY FOR YOU.
WHAT'S GOING ON?
WELL, JESS, YOU BETTER GET GOING.
YOU KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO BE LATE.
UH, MICHELLE, HONEY, YOU STAY HERE.
BUT DON'T YOU WANT TO TELL HIM?
GOOD-BYE?
UHYES, I DO.
UH, GOOD-BYE, SWEETHEART.
AND, UH, HEY GOOD LUCK, YOU MANLY MAN, YOU.
BOY, CAN WE KEEP A SECRET OR WHAT?
OHH BECK, YOU'LL NEVER GUESS WHAT HAPPENED.
OH, WAIT, WAIT!
I'M NOT READY YET.
OH, DARLING, YOU'RE HOME AT LAST.
YOU DID ALL THIS FOR ME?
WELL, I HAVE SOME REALLY GREAT NEWS FOR YOU.
I'VE GOT SOME GREAT NEWS FOR YOU.
GET THIS-- THE RECORD COMPANY SAID WE HAD THIS RETRO-PUNK HIP-HOP EURO-TRASH GARAGE BEAT.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL IT MEANS, BUT IT MUST BE GOOD, 'CAUSE THEY SIGNED US!
OH, HONEY, THAT'S GREAT!
I WANT TO HEAR ALL ABOUT IT OVER DINNER.
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT ARE WE HAVING?
I'M GLAD YOU ASKED, BECAUSE WE'RE HAVING BABY SHRIMP, BABY CORN, AND BABY BACK RIBS.
GOOD, 'CAUSE, BABY, I'M STARVED.
JESS, SWEETHEART, DO YOU SEE SOME SORT OF THEME RUNNING THROUGH THIS MEAL?
OH, THERE'S A THEME?

I LOVE IT.
VERY, VERY CLEVER.

NOTHING GETS BY YOU.
OH, BECK, I'M SO EXCITED, I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE THIS.
JESSE AND THE RIPPERS ARE GOING ON TOUR THIS SUMMER FOR 2 MONTHS, AND GET THIS--THIS IS THE BEST PART.
OUR FIRST STOP IS A STATE FAIR OPENING UP FOR AEROSMITH.
YOU'RE GOING TO OPEN UP FOR AEROSMITH?
WELL, TECHNICALLY, WE'RE OPENING A FEW DAYS BEFORE AEROSMITH GETS THERE, BUT WHY NITPICK?
SO YOU'RE GOING AWAY?
YEAH, BUT YOU'RE COMING WITH ME.
I MEAN, YOU HAVE VACATION TIME COMING UP, RIGHT?
I MEAN, THE TIMING IS PERFECT.

WONDER IF AUNT BECKY TOLD UNCLE JESSE ABOUT THE BABY YET?
I DON'T THINK SO.
WE HAVEN'T HEARD HIM SCREAM.
MAN, HE'S ON A ROLL TODAY-- HE'S HAVING A BABY, HE MIGHT HAVE A RECORD DEAL, AND HE'S HAVING A GREAT HAIR DAY.
I'M DONE.
YOU'LL NEVER GUESS.
BIG BIRD.

YOU GUYS ARE GOOD AT THIS.
HEY, YOU GUYS, I GOT THE GREATEST NEWS IN THE WORLD.
WE KNOW.
WAY TO GO.
I HAVEN'T TOLD YOU YET.
OH!
I GUESS YOU CAN TELL BY MY FACE.
I'M BEAMING.
WE SURE CAN.
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR MIRACLE.
WELL, I WOULDN'T EXACTLY CALL IT A MIRACLE.
I MEAN, IT TOOK A LOT OF HARD WORK.
YOU KNOW, AT THE RISK OF BEING VAIN, SOME NATURAL RAW TALENT, TOO.
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN PRACTICING FOR YEARS.
FRIENDS' GARAGES BASEMENTS LISTEN, WHEN THE BIG NIGHT COMES, I WANT YOU ALL THERE WITH ME AND BECKY, SCREAMING AND YELLING AND HOLDING UP LIGHTERS AND CHANTING, "JESSE!
JESSE!

I'M TALKING ABOUT GOING ON TOUR WITH MY BAND.
WHAT ARE YOU-- BOY, OH, BOY, IS MY STOMACH HUNGRY.
HONEY, WOULD YOU MIND GOING TO THE KITCHEN AND GETTING ME A NICE BIG CHUNK OF BEEF JERKY?
THANK YOU SO MUCH, SWEETHEART.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D DO WITHOUT YOU.
UH, ARE YOU TRYING TO GET RID OF ME?
OH, NO, NOT AT ALL.
NOW BEAT IT.
YOU DIDN'T TELL HIM ABOUT THE BABY YET?
WELL, I STARTED TO, BUT HE WAS SO EXCITED ABOUT GOING ON TOUR AND NOT HAVING ANY RESPONSIBILITIES THAT I CHICKENED OUT.
YOU HAVE TO TELL HIM.
YOU'RE RIGHT, DANNY.
I'LL JUST LOOK HIM STRAIGHT IN THE EYE AND SAY, "JESS, YOU WANT TO PLAY PICTURE CHARADE"?
NO.
UH, SURE YOU DO.
OF COURSE YOU DO.
YES, YOU DO.
JUST COME RIGHT BACK HERE, HONEY, AND HAVE A SEAT RIGHT OVER THERE.
NOW, EVERYBODY, THIS GAME IS JUST FOR JESSE, OK?

HONEY, LET'S TALK ABOUT GLEN FOR A SECOND.
YOU KNOW, IT'S FUN TO HAVE A GLEN OR A PRETEND DUCK LIKE NORTON OR MY BEST FRIEND WHEN I WAS A KID-- TERRY THE TALKING WASHCLOTH.
BUT WHAT IS IT YOU LIKE ABOUT GLEN?
HE'S MY FRIEND.
MY OTHER FRIENDS ARE GONE.
OH, BECAUSE PRESCHOOL JUST ENDED.

YEAH, BUT DON'T WORRY.
NEXT WEEK, YOU START KIDDY CAMP, AND YOU'RE GONNA MEET ALL KINDS OF NEW FRIENDS.

HE TALKS TOO MUCH.
SORRY, GLEN.
I LOVE YOU, MICHELLE.
I LOVE YOU, DADDY.
OH PRETTY SOON, IT'S GOING TO BE YOUR KID SAYING, "I LOVE YOU, DADDY".
CAN'T WAIT.
I REMEMBER WHEN D.J. WAS BORN.
PAM AND I, WE LOOKED DOWN AT THIS INNOCENT LITTLE BABY THAT WE ACTUALLY BROUGHT INTO THE WORLD, AND IT-- IT FELT LIKE I DON'T KNOW.
THIS IS WHY WE'RE HERE.
SO, DO YOU WANT TO DO THE HONORS AND TUCK MICHELLE IN?
YEAH.
I CAN USE ALL THE PRACTICE I CAN GET.
GOOD NIGHT, HONEY.
GOOD NIGHT.
GOOD NIGHT.
AW, MICHELLE, MICHELLE.
YOUR AUNT BECKY AND I ARE HAVING A BABY.
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A NEW LITTLE COUSIN.
IS IT A BOY OR GIRL?
WELL, WE DON'T KNOW YET.
THEN YOU CAN NAME IT BIG BIRD.
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M GOING TO BE A DADDY.
YOU THINK I'M READY TO RAISE A LITTLE KID?
YOU'RE DOING A VERY GOOD JOB WITH ME.
THANK YOU.
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.
I'M GOING TO BE THE BEST DARN DADDY A KID COULD EVER HAVE.
AND I'M NOT GONNA MISS ONE SECOND OF LITTLE BIG BIRD'S LIFE.
STARTING RIGHT NOW, I'M NOT LEAVING BECKY'S SIDE.
YOU AREN'T GOING AWAY?
GOODY!
OF COURSE I'M NOT GOING AWAY.
I-- OH, THE BAND.
WELL, THIS IS SOMETHING I ALWAYS WANTED TO DO, GO ON THE ROAD AND HAVE A DEAL WITH A RECORD COMPANY.
I CAN'T LET THE GUYS DOWN.
I MEAN, WITHOUT ME, JESSE AND THE RIPPERS WOULD BE AND THE RIPPERS.
THEN AGAIN, I CAN'T LET BECKY DOWN.
I MEAN, SHE'S MY WIFE.
I HOW DO I CHOOSE?
EASY.
PUT OUT YOUR HAND AND PLAY THE EENIE-MEENIE GAME.
COME ON, MICHELLE, I'M AN ADULT.
DO YOU WANT MY HELP OR NOT?
EENIE, MEENIE, MINEY, MOE.
CATCH A TIGER BY THE TOE.
IF HE HOLLERS, LET HIM GO.
YOU BETTER STAY WITH BIG BIRD.
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I WAS THINKING.
MICHELLE, I LOVE OUR LITTLE TALKS.
YOU ALWAYS MAKE THINGS SEEM SO SIMPLE.
THANKS FOR THE ADVICE, SHORTY.
JUST DOING MY JOB.
WHOA!
THIS BABY THING HAPPENS A LOT FASTER THAN I THOUGHT.
HONEY, WILL YOU STILL LOVE ME WHEN I LOOK LIKE THIS?
OF COURSE.
IT'LL BE GREAT, TOO, 'CAUSE I'LL HAVE A PLACE TO SET MY POPCORN WHEN WE WATCH TV.
YOU'RE VERY FUNNY.
YEAH.
NOW, LISTEN.
I'VE HAD SOME EXPERT ADVICE, AND I'VE MADE A VERY IMPORTANT DECISION.
I'M CANCELING THE TOUR, AND I'M GONNA STAY WITH YOU THIS SUMMER.
JESSWHO'D YOU GET THIS EXPERT ADVICE FROM?
MICHELLE.
SHE USED THE EENIE-MINEY-MOE METHOD.
HONEY, THAT'S VERY SWEET, BUT WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO MISS IN THE NEXT EIGHT WEEKS?
MORNING SICKNESS, MIDNIGHT CRAVINGS, SWOLLEN ANKLES, MOOD SWINGS.
HEY, LOOK, I DON'T CARE.
I'M GONNA BE RIGHT BY YOUR SIDE EVERY TIME YOU TURN AROUND, I'M GONNA BE THERE, HELPING YOU, SUPPORTING YOU, WHATEVER YOU NEED.
THAT'S REALLY GOING TO GET ON MY NERVES.
IS THIS A MOOD SWING?
HUH?
'CAUSE I'M THERE FOR YOU.
WATCH.
SEE?
HEY, HI, BABE.
I'M THERE FOR YOU, BABE.
SEE HOW THAT WORKS?
HONEY, I THINK IT'S VERY SWEET THAT YOU WANT TO BE BY MY SIDE, BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO STAY HOME.
I MEAN, IT'S LIKE YOU SAID.
I HAVE SOME TIME OFF.
I COULD TAKE MY VACATION.
I CAN GO ON THE ROAD WITH YOU, AND THEN I CAN SEE YOU ON THE WEEKENDS, TOO.
YOU CAN'T TRAVEL IN YOUR CONDITION.
YES, I CAN.
THE DOCTOR SAID IT'S PERFECTLY SAFE FOR ME TO TRAVEL.
HOW DO I KNOW?
I'VE NEVER BEEN PREGNANT BEFORE.
WELL, I'LL BE FINE.
JESS, I KNOW HOW MUCH THIS TOUR MEANS TO YOU, AND I DON'T WANT YOU TO MISS IT.
AND THAT'S WHAT THIS MARRIAGE IS ALL ABOUT-- MAKING EACH OTHER'S DREAMS COME TRUE.
WELL, YOU ALREADY MADE THE BEST DREAM OF ALL COME TRUE.
SO YOU'RE REALLY HAPPY ABOUT HAVING THE BABY RIGHT NOW?
AH, WELL, I MEAN, YOU KNOW, WE DIDN'T PLAN IT, BUT WHO CARES?
YES.
I'M SO HAPPY.
THANKS FOR MAKING ME BE A DADDY.
THANKS FOR MAKING ME A MOMMY.
I LOVE YOU.
HELLO.
THERE'S A KID IN THE ROOM.
MICHELLE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING AWAKE?
I DIDN'T SAY GOOD NIGHT TO BIG BIRD.
BIG BIRD?
THAT'S OUR BABY.
YOU NAMED OUR BABY BIG BIRD?
WELL, YOU KNOW, JUST FOR NOW, UNTIL WE FIND OUT IF IT'S A BOY OR GIRL OR A 9-FOOT YELLOW MUPPET.
GOOD NIGHT, COUSIN BIG BIRD.
SEE YOU SOON.
GET OVER HERE.
