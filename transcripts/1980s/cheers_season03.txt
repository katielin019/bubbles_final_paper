{START OF EPISODE 1}
REBOUND Hey, everybody.
I'm back from my Florida vacation.
Good to be home, back with the old gang.
Hey, how you been, pal?
Glad to, buddy.
Look at that.
Here's the old bar.
It hasn't changed a bit.
Hey, you're back!
Good to see you.
- It's good to be back.
- Oh, it's you.
From behind you looked like a friend of mine.
Hey, you kidder.
I'll get you for that.
- So, hi, Coach.
- Hi, Cliffie.
Boy, did I have a spectacular time basking up the old Florida sunshine.
I'll tell you.
I really got my head screwed on straight, too.
That experience changed me.
I'm now at one with the cosmos.
No more getting caught up At one with the cosmos, Coach.
No more getting caught up in the irritations of day-to-day life I'm just the kinda guy Yeah, I stood on many a wind-swept beach and felt a oneness felt a Anybody want a Mai Tai?
Mai Tai, Cliff!
Look!
You get it?
Mai Tai, Cliffie!
- Good afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!
Beer, Normie?
You know how to make it sound tempting, you fast talker!
- Guess who, buddy.
- Hey, Cliffie.
Missed you the last couple of days.
- I've been gone two weeks.
- I know.
Oh, God, I missed this guy!
Norm, how's Vera?
Any luck getting her in the family way yet?
- Still working on it.
- Hey, Norm, you want a kid?
Not really.
I'm just kinda going along with it to shut Vera up.
She wants to start a family to have something to do.
Poor Norm's been shooting blanks for the last couple of months.
Little louder.
We'll dance to it.
Don't worry, Normie.
You'll be planting your seed before you know it.
I hope so.
The doc says if something doesn't happen soon, we may have to take a drastic step.
- You mean - Sleep together.
- Our prayers are with you.
- Thank you.
Coach, how's Sammy been since I've been away?
Just about the same, Cliffie.
Terrible.
You should've seen him the other night.
He walks in with this lady librarian.
She's off-duty, right?
They both have a snootful.
- The lady librarian's got - Hey, gang!
Never mind.
My story's obsolete.
- Coach?
- Yeah.
- This is my bar, isn't it?
- Yeah, it sure is, Sam.
I told you I owned a bar.
I like it, Sam.
It's not much.
But then again, I am.
Hey, Sammy?
I think you got one over the legal limit there.
Hey, Cliffie's back!
How was your vacation?
My vacation.
You remembered?
- Atlantic City, right?
- Yeah, it was terrific.
Thanks a lot.
What branch of the service are these young ladies in?
I stole them off the front of a parade last night, Coach.
At this very moment there are 26 tuba players marching right into the river.
Show them your stuff, girls.
God, I love it!
Excuse me, Sam.
While you're waiting for runway clearance do you mind taking a look at this?
This is a piece of paper, isn't it?
And those are words.
- This is a letter or something.
- It is Joanne's resignation.
Hey, girls, take a break and give your dimples a rest.
- What?
- We lost another waitress.
She found out she wasn't the only girl in your life.
Nonsense, Carla.
She's been listening to vicious rumours.
Sammy, this means that I have to work alone again.
We can't keep a waitress because you keep breaking their hearts.
Well, obviously I need a good talking to.
Sammy, this is serious!
We've had eight waitresses in six months.
Bet I can remember all their names.
Dee Dee, Carlene, Angela, Sneezy, Dopey, Donner and Blitzen.
OK, girls, yo!
Step right this way, ladies.
It's time for the half-time show at the Sammy-dome.
Here you go, step lively!
Poor Sam.
Yeah, my heart bleeds for him.
Sure, Cliffie, he looks like he's having fun, but this is just the first stage.
He's going to end up drinking himself senseless.
He's turning into a real jerk.
Spends his time boozing and loving and leaving waitresses.
I wonder what set him off.
Suppose it might have been Dia Diabetes!
You were going to say that name?
- I wasn't.
- You know my rule.
- But I didn't say it.
- I don't even want you to think it.
Use that name and I will give you a sunroof.
What difference does it make how it started?
The important thing is can we do anything to stop him?
If we can't, can we join him?
If we can't join him, do you think he'd let me watch?
Cheers.
Yeah, he's here.
I'll give him the message.
Normie, it's Vera.
She says to hurry home.
Her cycle is at its peak.
Again?
Her cycle has more peaks than the Adirondacks.
All systems are go there, big fella.
Even Secretariat got to wait till he was in the mood once in a while.
Poor Coach!
After all you went through with Sam, seeing him right back where he was.
Really, Carla, it's eating me up.
I'm so desperate I feel like I'm going to do something crazy.
I am going to do something crazy!
- Wait.
What are you going to do?
- I know exactly what Sam needs.
- Coach, your apron!
- He's got an apron!
- Just put them down there.
- Thank you, Miss.
Now I know why I became a chauffeur instead of a longshoreman.
I would have been 72 on my next birthday.
I appreciate your bringing me home, Boggs.
Your mother and I felt strongly that the first face one should encounter on leaving a place like that should be a friendly one.
Why didn't she ever visit me there?
She wanted to visit you, Miss Diane, but you know how uncomfortable she is around psychiatrists.
She could have written me a letter.
And let them see her handwriting?
Boggs, that's insane.
As your mother would say, "Let's see them prove it in court.
" Which reminds me, I should be getting back.
- Thanks again for driving me home.
- It's my pleasure.
It's so nice to see you happy again.
Boggs, I think I'm as happy as I've ever been.
I have a new life.
All these wonderful things have happened to me.
I'm better now.
Miss?
I'm fine, Boggs.
I was just a little startled.
- It's a perfectly normal reaction.
- Perfectly.
- Who is it?
- It's Ernie Pantusso.
Coach?
What do you want?
I have to talk to you.
It's important.
Coach, you're a dear man and I love you and I've missed you, but you're part of a period of my life that I want to see fade into memory.
Do you understand, Coach?
Western Union.
This is a man I could never resist.
- How have you been?
- Fine.
And you?
- I'm OK, thank you.
- Sorry I had to fool you that way.
Perhaps I should be taking this opportunity to be going along.
Say hello to Mummy.
Why don't you have her call me?
You know how she feels about telephones.
Well, tell her to write.
Or, I'll write.
Or maybe we'll just run into each other sometime.
Nothing would please her more.
Goodbye.
How many pairs of socks has a guy like that got?
I have no idea.
Can I get you something?
I don't know what I've got.
I've been away several months at a sana vacation.
You didn't run into Cliffie, did you?
No.
Did he have a nervous vacation, too?
Oh, he's a wreck.
Listen, Diane, have you thought about stopping by and saying hello to everybody?
Coach, that wouldn't be a good idea.
Why?
Does anyone there ask about me?
No, that Carla won't let them.
Diane, I want you to come back to Cheers and have a talk with Sam.
Talk with S Yes, it's very important.
Maybe S Maybe the bartender there didn't tell you about our last conversation, but it ended in wrath and acrimony.
I vowed never to return to Cheers.
Let's be clear, nothing in heaven or hell will ever get me back there.
Diane, you might be my last chance.
Sam's boozing again.
Oh, dear.
Poor S Poor, dear S Am!
Well, I'm back.
- What'll it be, Normie?
- A transfusion with a head on it.
Norm, are you sure you want to have a kid?
Once the monster comes along, your whole life will be different.
You've had kids.
Does a baby change you?
Are you kidding, Normie?
It can't even change itself.
Well, I'll have to remember that.
- What day is it?
- Friday.
That's it.
Good night, everybody.
- Sam, please!
You can't leave.
- Why not?
A friend of yours is dropping by, and I promised you'd be here.
Great!
One of my old buds?
- I smell high times coming.
- Actually it's an old girlfriend.
Better still.
Hope it's one of the wild ones.
But then, weren't they all?
- No, they weren't all wild.
- Hold it right there, Coach!
If you are talking about the stick, I'll pull your lower lip over your head like a cabbage leaf.
Cut it out, Carla.
Diane's not coming back here.
- She said she's not coming back.
- Well, she might.
- What makes you say that?
- I asked her.
- What the hell did you do that for?
- Please listen to her.
- Promise me.
- I know what this is all about.
It's this drinking crap, isn't it?
I'm drinking because I like it, because it tastes good, and because I want to.
I don't want to see Diane Chambers.
You're going to have to see her because she'll be here any second now!
God!
We are all sitting around here like we're at the Queen's Tea and that thing is on its way.
In fact, it's very close.
I can sense it.
It's here!
And it's going to walk in and say something.
Stay out of this, Carla.
Hello Sam.
Hi there.
Did you forget something?
I dropped in to see how you're doing.
I just got back from Florida, Diane.
Everybody's fine.
You're looking good.
- Thank you.
How are you doing?
- I've never been better.
For God's sakes, will you stop it, Sam?
You've been boozing with two hands ever since Diane walked out on you.
- Sam, I'm so sorry.
- You're both crazier than hell!
I threw her out of here and my drinking has got nothing to do with Diane Chambers.
You hear that?
- Nothing!
- No, you're all wrong.
Sorry!
I did start drinking when she left.
I was celebrating.
Celebrating the day I got rid of you.
You hear?
Celebrating!
I'll tell you something.
I have two birthdays now.
One for when my mother bore me, and one to commemorate my glorious rebirth when I left here.
Just once more.
You did not walk out, I kicked you out.
I'd do it again, except no man deserves that much pleasure in one life.
Your brain could find shelter in the shade of a snow pea.
Don't, Sam!
Please.
I didn't come here to fight with you.
I came here to help.
Well, I've never been happier in my entire life.
You're going to help me out of all my happiness?
- You're the one person who could do it.
- No.
I want you to see a friend of mine.
He's a man I met recently at a sana vacation.
She's been locked up in a mental home for three months.
I was not locked up.
I could come and go at will.
Besides, it's not true.
- And how did you know about it?
- I got a cousin who's a private dick.
I wanted to find out if you were really gone.
And you were really gone!
I entered Golden Brook of my own volition for a little rest, relaxation What are you laughing at?
Well, I've had women get depressed when they left me, but I've never had one that went Charm like yours is a hard thing to live without all right.
It had nothing to do with you, Sam.
After I left here, I decided I needed to regroup.
I needed to take a good look at myself.
Shock treatment.
Carla, let's help Sam first.
And when the psychiatric profession has gained confidence from that triumph, we'll put them all on your case.
- Will you please meet this man?
- Come on, Diane.
Look Yeah, I'm drinking again, but it's not the same thing.
This time it's good-time controlled drinking.
Before it was negative.
Now it's fun.
- It won't kill you to talk to the guy.
- Coach, it's a waste of time.
Am I right, Carla?
- See what her friend has to say.
- Oh, come on - You listening to this, guys?
- Sammy, you're my friend, right?
Don't get defensive, but maybe you are drinking too much.
- Well, so are you.
- I already have a mother, lush face.
Sorry, I just think maybe you ought to hear the guy out.
Sammy, the way I see it is it can't do any harm and psychiatry has come a long way since "The Snake Pit" age.
Sam, they're all trying to tell you you need help.
I know what they're saying and why.
Coach here's gotten them all to gang up on me.
When you try to be a fun-loving drunk, you find out who your friends are.
OK, fine, forget it.
Drink all you want.
I know the reason why you're doing it.
What are you talking about?
You're afraid that I'm right about you and the doctor.
You can't stand admitting I'm right about anything.
Wrong again!
You're scared, Sam.
If I see this guy and he tells me that I'm happy and well-adjusted, which he will, if the quack has a brain, would you all please leave me alone?
- Of course.
Won't we?
- Yeah, sure.
OK, fine.
Tell him to drop by.
I'll try to fit him in between dames.
Why don't you say hello to him now?
I'm Dr Frasier Crane.
Sorry I startled you.
This is weird.
Diane said you're open-minded and would be responsive, so I dropped by a little early.
- She said that?
- She says lots of nice things about you.
Really?
So what say we go somewhere and have a cup of coffee and get to know each other?
OK.
Fine.
A few cups of Irish coffee and a chat it is.
Mind if I freshen up a bit?
- Fine.
- Thank you, Sam.
Boy, you sure are back in here for somebody who said they were never coming back in here.
Human beings change, Sam.
I've changed.
So can you.
Rest assured, I'm only visiting.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but you just called me human for the first time.
I guess I just needed a little time to think about it.
- I knew it.
- What?
Are you kidding?
Don't you see she's nuts about me?
Her young Doctor Killjoy there is just her way of saving face to get back in the bar.
- I don't know, Sam.
- I know the look.
She's in love.
- I have to run.
- Diane, you're remarkable, to help a man who's caused you so much grief.
I'm free of it now, Frasier.
I'm free of so many things now that I've fallen in love with you.
I am the luckiest person on earth.
The second luckiest.
Not here, Diane.
Of course.
I get carried away.
- I understand.
- That's why I love you.

{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
REBOUND That's it, folks.
Closing it up.
- Night, Coach.
- Good night, guys.
- Normie, you want to get a bite to eat?
- I have a wife at home.
We could stop by and pick her up.
I haven't met her yet.
I don't think so.
Not tonight.
Wait a minute.
Are you ashamed of me or her?
A little of both, I guess.
Hey, everybody.
I'm back.
Last week on Cheers, I, Cliff Clavin, postman and happy wanderer, returned from a vacation in the state of Florida.
It was an invigorating experience.
I'd tell you about it but certain parties insist I fill you in on the story.
Diane and Sam had a little falling by the wayside.
They went separate ways, Sam went back to his old ones.
I don't know which wagon Sam fell off, but back to the bottle he went.
Diane went what we euphemistically call and spent time in a country hospital.
After she got out, Coach got her into Cheers to try and talk sense into Sam.
She talked him into seeing a psychiatrist.
Sam agreed, not knowing that the shrink and Diane were dating steadily, and rumour has it, heavily.
Sam is under a misconception that Diane still carries the torch for him.
Diane thinks that Sam is the torch bearer.
You know something?
I may have the wrong batch of slides.
These are my snaps of FLA.
You all know how Sam and Diane look.
But a lot of you haven't seen The Sunshine State.
What we're looking at here is All right, who pulled the plug?
Very funny.
Come on!
You're a failure and you're gutless because you won't admit it.
You've hurt everyone who's tried to reach you.
You make me sick!
Sam, tell me what's on your mind.
- How much this will cost.
- You're thinking of money?
Yeah, I hope it's not going to be a lot because I get Diane to do this for free.
She used to abuse me for free all the time.
Well, it wasn't exactly free.
I had to sleep with her.
Beneath your flippancy I sense a lot of hostility towards Diane.
And towards myself.
Look, I haven't had a drink in ten days.
I've got a problem, but I'm going to AA and I think I'm going be OK.
No, you're better than OK, Sam.
You're abundantly human.
You said I made you sick.
I was confronting you.
Forget about that.
I am telling you that you're abundantly human.
Great, I really think I'm going be able to handle this.
I don't.
- I'm abundantly human, remember?
- Don't you see?
I'm putting you on an emotional pendulum.
I don't want to be on anything.
I want to quit.
- What?
- This is distressing.
- I hear Sam "the failure".
- You said I was abundantly human.
An abundantly human person can change.
- I want to quit, that's a change.
- You're becoming compulsive.
- We should double our sessions.
- Double?
Come on!
- I'll be OK.
- You have progressed.
- Good, let's quit.
- Sam!
There's that word again.
Do you realise that you keep saying it?
Could you stop if you wanted to?
Frasier?
I know a peaceful place in the country.
I could get you in.
Lovely grounds, nice food, casual dress.
Your tie and belt will be confiscated.
Frasier, I'm not going to a hospital.
I am not having any more sessions.
- We're through.
Get the hell out.
- Sam!
We did it!
- Did what?
- You're a whole person.
Really, I mean that.
- I am?
- You stood up to me.
You no longer need to run from problems, need to drink, or need to spend weekends at a hospital, bombed on Thorazine.
- Goodbye.
- Wait a minute.
Sam, you must break this attachment.
Swim, Sam, swim.
No, Frasier, no.
I just want you to tell me what you think put Diane in the "ha ha house".
I'm not her doctor, and if I were, I couldn't discuss it.
It doesn't matter.
She went nuts cos I kicked her out.
Sam, I don't think you should use the word "nuts" when discussing Diane.
Well, you've met her.
Give me a better one.
Bonkers.
You see, you don't need alcohol to have fun.
In my profession there's no such thing as a closed door.
That explains how Diane got out.
As long as you have that humour, you can't ever go completely astray.
- Goodbye.
- So long, Doc.
Hey, Frasier.
Say hello to all your loons for me.
Carla, why do you build walls between yourself and everyone else?
Have you taken a good look at everyone else?
Touché.
Here's to Sammy.
Ten days without the slow death of alcohol.
No, don't toast me for that.
Getting back on the bottle was stupid.
I was reading in an article, alcohol actually eats huge holes in the tissue of Some people like bartenders who tell great stories and jokes.
No, give me a good temperance lecture any time.
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, well.
I don't have an alcoholic personality.
You don't have a personality.
I'm going to resist hurling a rejoinder in your direction out of the respect I bear for members of your gender.
Please make sure that's all you bare for members of my gender.
- Hello, everybody.
- Coach, come here.
- I've been dreading this moment.
- Why?
Diane will beg me to get back together and I'm going to break her heart.
That's terrible.
No, the terrible thing is, I'm looking forward to it.
And then after being in the Everglades, Seminole Indians made me the honorary mail carrier of the tribe.
- Hi, Sam.
Is Frasier here?
- No, we finished our session.
He's making remarkable progress.
- It's you I want to talk to, anyway.
- Yeah, I know.
I figured.
You probably remember where the office is, right?
Oh, yes.
I've seen it in my dreams.
Coach, I'm going take a break.
Hey, Coach.
Who's "Miss God's Gift to the World"?
I didn't see the show this year.
I think Miss Kansas won.
Strange to be here again.
- Using a new cologne?
- No, that's the roach bomb.
But, you know, that's not a Yes, well, down to business.
Sam, there's something I've been keeping from you and I've got to tell you now.
There's something I need to say to you and I think I ought to go first.
No, I think maybe I should go first.
Maybe.
I'm over you.
You're over me?
- You don't think that I still - You've got your - You thought I - Well, so did you.
We keep doing it.
Something we thought we'd seen the last of is resurfacing.
Yeah, my lunch.
Rest assured I have no feelings left for you.
Nothing.
I assure you I feel less than nothing for you.
- Then there's nothing really left to say.
- There is one thing you should know.
It's important.
There's another man in my life and he's someone you know.
Really?
Who?
Frasier and I have been lovers for several weeks.
- What do you mean, ooh?
- I'm sorry.
I just got a little mental picture.
It took me by surprise.
Well, why didn't you say something sooner?
Frasier didn't want to tell you in case it interfered with your therapy.
We had a terrible fight about it No we had a wonderful fight about it.
Frasier says fighting can be wonderful if you lay out the rules, share your hurt, and never lose respect for the other's abundant humanness.
Boy, you people with full lives.
- Well - Well Wait, a second.
Guys, I think you ought to hear this.
Diane got herself a new fella.
She and Frasier Crane are lovers.
- What do you mean, ooh?
- I mean ooh two should be very happy together.
Sam, I thought you said she was still nuts about you.
I was wrong, and I'm happy to be wrong.
Me too.
Well - I guess this is goodbye.
- I guess it is.
What are you doing here?
I've been looking for you.
I'm so glad you're here.
Diane, you shared our secret with Sam, didn't you?
- Yes, and he took it wonderfully.
- In fact, let me buy you a drink.
Why, thanks, Sam.
I'll have a white wine spritzer.
Well, OK.
I'll have one, too.
It's our drink.
- You two met in the bin, did you?
- Yes, and it isn't a "bin".
Golden Brook is a pastoral retreat.
Did you hold hands during the lobotomy?
Diane, take a joke.
I love you.
Frasier is a consulting psychiatrist.
He wasn't my therapist.
How did you two get together?
I was playing croquet one beautiful morning.
It's a game I learned during my stay there and I got quite good at it.
I saw you do that.
You are a naughty, naughty girl.
- It wasn't - I saw you do it.
Be a grown-up.
It was amazing how I could lose myself in the game.
I'm annoyed.
When playing with someone of equal ability, it gave me an appreciation for the nobler aspects of competition.
- What is this business?
- I'm not playing with you any more!
Fine, then go to Frasier happened by in the midst of this spirited contest and he stopped to correct a flaw in my swing.
My opponent on that day was as crafty a strategist as I. We really brought out the best in each other.
Girls!
Ladies!
Frasier remained to watch my game, and to good-naturedly arbitrate a close call for us.
Under the attentive gaze of a distinguished doctor I lost some of my concentration on the game itself.
Who's your doctor?
Who would guess a leisurely game of croquet would provide me with such a trophy?
Indeed.
That's quite a story.
How is your romantic life going, Sam?
I'm dating a girl that I think may just turn out to be the woman I've been waiting for all my life.
Sam Malone!
You went out with my sister!
Did you think it wouldn't get back to me?
I have had just about as much as I can take from you!
As far as I'm concerned, you never existed.
Well, the search continues.
Swim, Sam, swim.
Great, now I have to work another Saturday night by myself.
You promised you wouldn't boink any more waitresses unless it was me.
I'm going to have to find somebody, who I can keep my hands off of.
Are you looking for work?
Thank you very much for the very attractive offer, but I'm not interested.
I understand.
How silly of me.
You couldn't possibly come back to work here.
- What are you talking about?
- Well, it's interesting.
I mean, it doesn't bother me at all, but it must create a problem for you.
- Frasier, could we go now, please?
- Of course, dear.
This is goodbye for now, but there's no such thing as a former patient.
Once you've been my patient, I'm always there when you Oh, great.
I'll bet this is important.
- Where's the phone?
- In the hallway.
- Why don't you have a seat there?
- No, thank you.
I understand.
What do you understand?
I assume what you said in there was the truth, but obviously you're feeling sexual tension around me.
Sitting that close would be kind of rough on you.
The fact of the matter is I don't want to work here because I think I have a better lot in store than a life of serving beer to squamulous laggards.
Please, Diane.
The man's in the room.
- Tell Frasier I'm waiting outside.
- I understand.
It'd be safer to wait around the corner.
I do give off this aura.
That's the roach bomb.
Diane, listen.
Please!
I have something to say and it's straight from here.
- What is it, Coach?
- This is my heart, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
Diane, if you walk out that door, he's back on the bottle.
Well, I can't be responsible for that.
Diane, don't tear his heart out again, please.
You'd do us both a favour if you stick around.
Just a couple or three weeks.
Just till he gets back on his feet.
Please.
Well I've gone this far, I might as well persist.
She's back!
If Frasier approves, I'll stick around, and help you through your waitress problem.
Wait a second.
You mean to tell me you're coming back to work here?
I'll take it until a better job comes along.
Cleaning up after rodeos, for instance.
- Great, Sam?
Diane's back.
- Great.
What did you say to her?
I said she walks out that door, she's back in that nut house in a month.
I see.
- You're not going to tell her, are you?
- No, of course not.
Well, welcome aboard, Miss Chambers.
Thank you, Mr Malone.
That Coach is a pretty smart fella sometimes, isn't he?
Yes, he is, Sam.
- Well, enough said about that.
- Yes, enough.
- Diane, shall we be off?
- I'm going to come back to work here.
What?
No.
As Frasier Crane, MD, I don't think that's a good idea for the two of you.
And as Frasier Crane, man, I don't think it's a good idea for the three of us.
Frasier, listen to me.
Sam needs my help in the bar.
If you feel any jealousy, let me assure you I could work with this man all my life and feel nothing.
Work?
I could live in the same house and never be tempted.
I could sleep in the same bed and get nothing but a good night's rest.
I could get out of jail after twelve years serve on a ship with an all-male crew for another four, be dropped off on a desert island for another three, eating nothing but raw oysters, and if Diane came out of the surf naked one day, all I'd want from her would be the hockey scores.
And you wouldn't even get that.
I'm afraid that's not good enough.
Diane, we're leaving.
Excuse me, Diane.
Doc, could I have a word with you?
- What about?
- Listen, Doc.
If you take her out that door now, those two will be dreaming dreams about each other from now on.
But, if she worked here, Doctor, hatred.
I'm glad Coach stopped me to ask me about career opportunities in psychiatry.
Yes, Harvard is excellent.
You see, it gave me some time to reflect.
- Diane, you must come back to work.
- I must?
You and Sam had an emotional experience.
Now this will give you an opportunity to defuse, to demythologise your romance.
Isn't he amazing?
Abundantly.
- Sammy, are you going to tell Carla?
- Yeah Maybe you ought to give me a hand.
What's this all about?
- Got her?
- Check.
Carla, Diane is coming back to work here.
Really?
At last, some help.
And she's had experience, too.
I hope she can start right away.
Take her in the back.
You think I'll try to kill her, or hurt her, or maim her.
Walls, walls, walls.
Sam, Diane and I really must be going.
- But we'll be seeing each other again.
- I guess we will.
Hey, Frasier, let me congratulate you on your new honey.
Thanks, Sam.
I've never been happier.
Let me congratulate you, too, Diane.
For heaven's sake, give her a kiss.
- Yeah, why not?
- Why not?
Seems appropriate.
Now there's a healthy beginning.
Nuts about me.
Pitiful.

{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
I CALL YOUR NAME What can I say?
I just remembered, this isn't my night off.
We'll have to cut this lovely evening short.
- I wish you'd told me sooner.
- I did, over dinner.
You didn't hear me over the oompah-pah band and the noise of you chewing bratwurst.
I've been looking forward to this for a long time.
- RV show tickets aren't easy to get.
- Please, Eddie.
I'm torn up enough.
Coach - You like RVs, mobile homes?
- I don't know much about them.
- Like to learn?
- I was meaning to.
Coach, meet Eddie.
Eddie.
Coach.
He's got tickets to the RV show tonight.
How's that sound?
- Terrific.
- I'll cover for you.
Hot dog!
Some luck!
- I guess I won't get a good night kiss.
- You might if you're nice to him.
I can't wait.
Do they let you walk through those things?
- Yeah, if you take your shoes off.
- OK.
Not now.
- Jerk.
- Yeah?
For once it's not you.
Mr Fancy Bottom feels his martini isn't dry enough.
Well, do you want me to kill him for you, Diane?
It's too good for him.
Come on, lighten up.
This is a bar.
People come here to have a good time.
- Yeah, don't you just hate them for it?
- What's wrong?
I'm having a bad day.
Can I have a bad day?
You've given us plenty.
Keep one for yourself.
I hope it's to your satisfaction.
We aspire to make every customer a happy customer.
It's still not dry enough.
Drink it!
Say, excuse me, folks.
She gets a little upset still, ever since I dumped her.
Let me do this.
Coach!
The driest martini in town, on the house.
- Right.
- Please, forgive her.
She's a firebrand.
I spend half my day apologising to nice customers like you.
- Carla, I'm in no mood.
- We're talking about someone else.
One vodka rocks.
- Is there anything I can do?
- No.
This problem is between myself and Frasier Crane.
Suffice to say he insists on making mountains out of molehills.
He wants you to wear a padded bra?
Go mate with a squid.
Please forgive her again.
She spent time in an institution recently.
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Hey, Cliffie.
Can you believe those Sox?
I miss those carefree halcyon days when my only concern was baseball.
Cliffie, got something on your mind?
I saw a fellow postal employee remove a fragrance sample from a magazine.
- So?
- It's against employee regulations.
It's a smudge on every mail carrier who ever donned this uniform.
- So?
- So?
On one hand, I don't want to be a snitch.
But, on the other, I can't endorse anarchy.
- What should I do?
- Compromise, have a beer.
I see I should look elsewhere for help on this.
- Diane, I've got a little problem here.
- Who doesn't?
Valid, valid.
Well, I guess my choice is clear.
I must follow my conscience and report this.
Come on, man.
It's a fragrance sample.
Let it go.
Let it go?
I let this go and tomorrow Hitler is in the White House.
I can do without that.
Sure, it's only a perfume sample, but if he gets away with it, the others will start taking things, too.
First, whole magazines go missing.
Then social security cheques.
Before long, Grandma's fruitcake doesn't make it to little Bobby, Peggy and Sue.
Their little hearts will break, thinking Grandma forgot them this year.
What are those little green things in a fruitcake, Cliff?
They look like parts of tyres.
- You're getting a little off the point.
- You brought it up, Cliffie.
Who is this menace to society?
Do you remember Lewis, that fella I brought in here?
- Enormous black gentleman?
- That's the one.
Cliff!
Come on, I'd think twice before crossing Lewis.
It could be dangerous.
He's not the kind of guy who drinks tea with his pinkie sticking out.
Please, Sam, there are ladies present.
- I'm sorry, Coach.
- Thank you.
I guess the bottom line is that it'd be snitching.
- I like to think I'm a little above that.
- Absolutely.
What's that?
You announcing the birth of yet another child?
- Or are you implying something?
- You'd rat on a little guy.
- Yeah?
I'm going to rat on this guy, too.
- Don't let Carla goad you into this.
Sammy, as long as I wear this uniform, I have a duty to fulfil.
I'll speak my truth and take the consequences.
- Supervisor, please.
- Come on, Cliff.
I don't care about the risk.
The voice of Clifford Clavin is going to be heard.
Hello, hang on to your yockstrap.
I have a terrible thing to report.
- Good night.
- Night, Cliffie.
Cliff.
You want to spend the night in my office?
- You still think I'm afraid, don't you?
- Yumpin' yimminy, no.
That Swedish accent was just for the amusement of the bar.
I don't care if Lewis finds out it was me.
In fact, if I ever see the guy again, I'll tell him it was me and clear the air.
You're the man I'm looking for.
- I've been fired!
- I'm sorry!
God, I'm terribly sorry.
You're taking this worse than I am.
I just want to find out who did it.
- Did what?
- Someone called the supervisor and squealed on me for taking a perfume sample out of a magazine.
He fired you for that?
What kind of a chicken outfit do we work for?
You smell divine.
What are you wearing?
Giorgio for Men.
Who could blame you?
It's perfect for you.
- Sorry I can't help you out.
- You can.
Know how you stick your nose in people's business at the post office?
You're nosy!
- I want to know who did it by tomorrow.
- OK, pal.
Be here at 7:00 and don't be late.
Be here at 7:00 and don't be late cos I'll have that information.
I know you will.
Lewis?
Thanks for thinking of me.
- Tomorrow I die.
- Come on, now.
The guy is going to beat the living hell out of me.
No use saying I don't deserve it.
- Nobody did.
- Thanks, Carla.
- Coach, let's go home.
- Yeah.
Can I play my French language tapes on the way home?
No.
We hear them every night.
I'm sick of it.
- They're not doing any good.
- They are.
Say "How are you today"?
in French.
How are you today?
In French.
- I rest my case.
- I rest my case.
- Knock it off.
- Knock it off.
- Frasier.
- Hi, Sam.
Diane left about 15 minutes ago.
Darn.
Guess I'll go to her house to shoot the breeze.
Diane is more like a monsoon.
Yes, her breeze is like a monsoon.
Good night.
- Want to come in and have a beer?
- I wouldn't want to impose.
OK, good night.
This is fun.
I've got time for bar room chatter.
Might do the old boy good.
Maybe.
Well, I'll have a tankard of your finest lager.
I understand the local Boston Red Sox baseball franchise has a Herculean task to qualify for the post-season tournament.
Yeah, they really stink this year.
Stink?
Interesting theory.
While we're on the subject of Boston and the world and all of its people, I have this patient.
Let's call him Give him any old name.
Thor.
For the first time in my career, I can't solve this problem.
But it occurs to me that you might.
You want my opinion on one of your patients?
Believe it or not, psychiatrists value input from outside the profession.
I'd like the benefit of your experience.
You know women.
I mean, your sexual exploits could be thought of as a majestic panoramic mural.
- And Thor's?
- A silly little doodle.
All right.
What the hell?
What's his problem?
Thor's girlfriend, let's call her Electra cried out another man's name during the act of love.
- Oh, Thor.
Ouch.
- Precisely.
So, Sam, tell me.
You've been with a lot of women.
When you were with one of them, did she ever call out another man's name?
I don't think so, but then who listens?
Usually I've got the stereo turned up and other things on my mind.
Tell me, whose name did Electra call out?
- An old boyfriend's.
- Double ouch.
Although they've decided it means nothing, which it doesn't, Thor doesn't seem to be able to get over it.
So if Thor came to you, what would you tell him?
The truth, that it happens all the time.
- Really?
- It happens to all guys.
In fact, I just remembered it's happened to me before, lots of times.
I turned the stereo up because of that.
Really?
Well, thank you, Sam.
I'll pass that along to - Thor.
- Right.
It's getting late.
Thanks for the cold one, Sam.
The beer, I mean, not Diane.
Two sips of liquor and I'm a jack-a-ninny.
- Lewis will be here any minute.
- What's your plan?
Plan?
I have no plan.
Unless honesty and straightforwardness are a plan.
No, I meant your medical plan.
Your humour's falling on deaf ears.
Good, you won't miss them when Lewis rips them off your head.
Sam.
Sam?
Barkeep.
I'm sorry, Diane.
Do you want me?
Actually, I want two Becks.
Guess I didn't hear you calling out my name.
Is something amusing you that I don't know about?
No, why do you ask?
That stupid look on your face.
Do I need a reason to look stupid?
You have the best reason of all.
OK, Clavin, you know why I'm here.
- Who is it?
- Lewis I've written a man's name on a piece of paper in this envelope.
- Good.
- Before you look at it, let me tell you something about him.
Is this "The Dating Game"?
The man whose name is in this envelope bears no animosity towards you or any living thing.
He's a man who loves his country.
He did it out of a sense of duty towards America, God and all that we cherish.
One other thing.
The man who did this is terribly sorry.
Please forgive him.
OK.
I've got another job anyway.
If I saw that name, I'd get so angry I might do something stupid.
Go on.
Open it.
I can't tell you how proud I am to see you overcome your need for vengeance.
Tell that fellow he's real lucky he's still in one piece.
He knows it, Lewis.
You'd better.
You really showed me something there.
That was more than just stupidity.
There was a trace of bravery in there.
- Way to go, Cliff.
- Thanks.
All right, who's Juan Torrez?
- There must be some mistake.
- No.
There's a map to his house.
I knew he wasn't going to look in that thing.
Besides, he knows it was me.
So what's the big deal?
He'd never hit Juan.
He's in a body cast.
He fell out of a window.
- What?
- What what?
Don't be coy.
It doesn't go with the sloping forehead.
Did I tell you your boyfriend stopped by?
- What's his name?
- You know very well it's Frasier.
Frasier, right!
That's an easy name to forget.
- How are you two doing?
- Fine.
- Is there something on your mind?
- No, why do you ask?
If there's a spot on an empty canvas, it tends to stand out.
No, if I had something to say, I'd say it.
I'd even yell it out.
Passionately.
What did you and Frasier talk about?
Let's drop this whole thing.
It's going nowhere.
We both have more important work to get back to.
I know I'm running a little behind.
You're smug.
You think you have something on me.
- I emphasise 'think'.
- I'm not thinking.
No, but this is as close as you get.
Come on.
Why don't you stop this silly little game and admit you're still crazy about me?
You're the one who always brings it up.
If anybody's crazy about anybody, you're crazy about me.
I'm not saying "Sam" when I'm in bed with Frasier.
I'll kill him!
I'll kill you!
- Then I'll kill myself.
- You're overreacting.
There's no need to kill me.
- Hello.
- Hello, your buttocks!
Get in here!
- You seem agitated.
- I don't know who I hate the most.
That's not bad.
Only two months and you're tied with me.
- How could you tell him?
- I didn't.
He must have deduced it.
Oh, please.
Come on, I'm good at deducement.
- How could you betray my confidence?
- You didn't say no telling.
I see.
Obviously I made the mistake of treating you as an adult.
- Why tell him anything to begin with?
- I was hoping for some insight.
Insight!
From a man whose idea of intellectual stimulation is to count along with Big Bird?
In his arrogance, he thought that when I called out "Sam", I was referring to him.
- And you weren't?
- No!
It was a different Sam entirely.
It was Sam Goldwyn.
His movies always gave me great pleasure.
Diane, Sam, please.
Let's not go on this way.
Now it's out in the open, let's face it and admit the truth.
- What are you talking about?
- There's still a spark between you two.
It's best that I step aside and allow it to either ignite or extinguish itself.
Frasier, look into my eyes.
You are the man in my life.
There is no longer anything between Sam and I. You'll see the same thing in his eyes.
Can't I just tell him?
Do it, Sam.
There's nothing going on between us.
It's all over between me and Diane.
- I believe you.
- Frasier, thank God!
- How could you have doubted me?
- I don't know.
I really haven't been myself these last few days.
What do you say we take a weekend off and go someplace together?
Yes, let's.
I'd better go.
I'm late for my marital relations group.
And, thanks.
I'd like to apologise to you both for flying off the handle.
It just shows that even psychiatrists get the blues.
Diane, see you later.
- Sam.
- Yeah?
- Go Red Sox.
- Ra!
What actors we are, Sam.
- I'm amazed we could pull that off.
- Pull what off?
Fooling a man so versed in human behaviour.
There is a spark, isn't there, Sam?
Well Gee I don't think it would take much encouragement to turn it into an inferno.
Maybe you're right.
Sam, let's stop stopping ourselves.
Let's let it happen.
Happen.
Happen, yeah.
- Oh, Diane - Frasier!
Oh, yeah?
Well, ha ha!

FAIRY TALES CAN COME TRUE "And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming "And the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor "And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor "Shall be lifted never more"!
- Doc, you tell great stories.
- That was Poe.
Don't be modest.
It was great.
Who's next to chill us with a scary story?
I think I have a chilling tale.
Yeah, but it's cute when you wiggle it.
I got the greatest ghost story ever told.
Casper got caught in this huge laundry basket Don't finish it.
Some of us want to sleep tonight.
You're right, Carla.
It's best that I live with it myself.
My God, what a horrible sight.
Speaking of horrible sights, Coach, take a look at this!
Two vodka rocks with a twist.
Didn't I tell you that Halloween at Cheers would be fun?
Yes, but I won't hold it against you.
I got those two tickets for the Boston Pops.
- Wonderful.
- Are you going to the Boston Pops?
- I'm jealous.
- You sound like a fan, Sam.
The Boston Pops was the one cultural event that Sam genuinely liked.
Yeah.
I especially liked the 18 somethingth overture.
- 1812.
- You really know your stuff.
Yeah.
Till Diane dragged me to that concert, I never realised just how many years of practice and dedication it takes to become a musician.
- Anyone in particular impress you?
- Yeah, the guy on the cannons.
He's incredible.
You know, I actually thought about taking it up myself, but I think it's one of those things you have to start when you're young.
- They say to be truly great, you do.
- That's what I thought.
Sometimes I think Sam is pretending to be less intelligent than he really is.
But how intelligent would someone have to be to pretend to be that dumb?
- I'm not even sure I could pull it off.
- Yes, you could.
I'm sorry, Carla, if we offended you with our public display of affection.
But try to understand, Frasier Crane has the same effect on me that cheap chianti and dice hanging from a rear view mirror have on you.
You got it bad.
Hello, everyone.
And a happy All Hallows' Eve.
- Guess who I am.
- Cliff Clavin.
No, Coach, let me give you a hint.
I went to Florida to find the fountain of youth.
Cliff Clavin.
Coach, I'm Ponce de León.
- I think your ears are too big.
- For Ponce de León?
- No, for you, Cliffie.
- I don't know, Coach.
I'm very proud of my big ears.
A lot of women consider them erogenous zones during heavy petting.
Are you kidding?
You never had a date in your life.
Because he's never had the guts to ask a girl out.
It's got nothing to do with guts.
It's just that the women you find in the northeastern seaboard bore me.
I prefer southern belles.
The kind of women you find in Florida.
He's going to go on about Florida again.
When I was down there, I was covered with women.
- Sure they weren't mosquitoes?
- Thank you, Bob Hopeless.
I'll just go in the back and scope out the dollies.
- Why don't you guys lighten up on Cliff?
- Sorry, Sam.
But you've got to admit, it's a little bit weird.
He's never been married.
I've never seen him with a woman.
Norm, he's your best friend.
Is he gay or what?
I can't believe what I'm hearing!
You can't tell a gay guy by his appearance.
We had an outfielder on the Red Sox, Duke Roberts.
He never got married or went with girls.
He even wore fancy Italian shoes and he lived with a guy who was a florist.
And Duke wasn't gay.
Yes, he was, Coach.
He was?
Do you think he'd like to meet Cliffie?
Come on, guys.
Cliff is not gay, all right?
He's just shy around women to the point of being a blithering idiot.
Diane, that was a colleague on the phone.
He's taken ill.
He wants me to take his place tomorrow at a seminar at the University of Chicago.
I've got to go home and pack.
- We won't be able to go to the concert.
- You can still go.
Listen, take along a friend.
Sam indicated some interest.
Sam?
I think I could find more stimulating company for the concert.
I wouldn't have to look farther than the nearest Petri dish.
Once again, I am startled by how far you are above petty emotion like jealousy.
I just figured it was time Sam learned to appreciate instruments without fuses.
- Goodbye, my tiny Alice.
- Goodbye, my mad Mad Hatter.
There are many theories why the Florida orange is superior to the Californian.
I think it's the trace mineral element in the Floridian water.
Due to the frequency of the typhoons and the nitrogen-rich alligator guano.
- Furthermore, there's three - I just remembered I left my oven on.
If I hurry home, I can stick my head in it.
Florida oranges are delicious.
- What?
- Nothing.
Have you been to Florida?
No, but it's always been a crazy dream of mine to go.
I read that they have the world's largest pair of alligator shoes there.
That's right.
In Orlando.
I even sat in one of them.
- What's your name?
- Tinker Bell.
What's yours?
Me?
I guess it's Ponce de León.
The guy that discovered Florida.
Would you marry me and bear my children?
Would you like to go in the back and maybe play some pool?
Or as they say in Tallahassee, shoot some pocket billiards?
- I'd love to, Mr León.
- Please, call me Ponce.
It looks like you're out to conquer new territories, Ponce.
Holy God.
Did anyone ever tell you you dance divinely, Ponce?
Someone mentioned it to me.
Was that Cortez or Pizarro?
I'm ready to go.
Would you hand me my purse?
I'll put a new tune on the jukebox.
I'm not using a pair of tickets tomorrow for the Boston Pops.
You can have them if you're interested.
- No, thank you.
- You'll enjoy it!
The programme is an evening filled with fireworks and laser beams, occasionally interrupted with the music of Gershwin.
I just can't think of who I'd take.
Most of the women I date don't like music they can't dance to.
Most of the women you date don't like music they can't shed clothing to.
- How come you don't want to go?
- I do.
But Frasier's out of town and I can't think of anyone I'd like to go with.
I guess Frasier would feel uncomfortable if you and I went.
- No, actually he suggested it.
- So, you'd be uncomfortable?
Not at all.
While you still harbour tortured longings for me, the emotions are unreciprocated.
I don't see why we shouldn't go together.
- Then it's a date.
- No, not a date.
I mean not a date date.
Well, it's a What would you call an evening with a woman when you have absolutely no hope of physical involvement whatsoever?
A first.
I guess it's time for me to be heading back to Never Never Land.
- Let me walk you back to your car?
- No, that's OK!
It's right outside here.
But I just want to know when we're going to see each other again.
We haven't seen each other at all yet.
I know!
Let's meet tomorrow night on this very spot as ourselves at eight o'clock.
Don't you be a minute late.
- Nice enough young person, Sam?
- Way to go, Cliffie!
What do you mean?
If I didn't know you, I'd say that you were pretty smooth tonight.
Sam, I think I resent that a little bit.
Well, that's OK.
You just think you know me a lot better than you really do.
Tonight wasn't really all that unusual for me.
- Come on, Cliff.
- No, really, it was commonplace.
- What?
- OK, three, two, one Hooray!
I got a date!
Thank you, Sam.
Here we are.
Yeah, thank you for the ride home and thank you for the concert.
That Gershwin's a genius.
The mark of a great composer is when the audience leaves humming your fireworks.
- I had a great time.
- Me, too.
I've not had such a good time since I know when you stopped having good times, Diane.
It goes without saying.
I would have had a better time if I had gone with Frasier.
Me, too.
Thanks for a lovely evening.
How did you like our first outing with no promise or threat of sexual encounter?
You're not out that door yet.
Good evening, everybody.
- Can I have a beer, please, Coach?
- This one's on me, Coach.
- Thank you, Norm.
- Cliffie Well?
Well, what?
Last I saw, you were dancing together.
- Yeah, so?
- So you know?
No, Norm, I don't know.
He wants to know if you boinked her, you dink.
Good God, Norm!
Psychologists believe that one night of meaningless pleasure can get in the way of commitment?
- Is that true, Sam?
- I rely on it.
She's meeting me here tonight at eight o'clock.
Eight o'clock.
I don't believe this.
You're meeting in 15 minutes.
I don't believe how calm you are.
Don't tell me that you subscribe to that myth about my discomfiture with women.
I was here when a woman asked you the time.
You swallowed the lower half of your face.
You know nothing about body language.
That gesture is replete with erotic message.
- To a baboon.
- All right.
I admit that in the past I've been shy around women, but I've been thinking about it and I don't think there's been any real reason for my insecurity.
As a matter of fact, watch this.
Sammy, lighter.
May I?
Thank you.
You're very wel I mean, you're welcome.
You're You're very extremely You're I think he's too damn smooth for his own good.
I'm such a wimp!
I'm such a wuss.
I'm such a weenie!
God, am I a dink!
I know you're nervous, but this one's different.
- You danced with her.
- I didn't dance with her.
- Ponce de León did.
- You did.
I was just playing a role.
- Tonight I'm me, a tongue-tied yutz.
- I want you to listen to me for a minute.
There's been a lot of talk about you.
The one always defending you is me.
That's what best friends are for.
But it's almost eight o'clock.
The one woman weird enough for you to have a shot at may be outside.
You blow this, I don't even want to look at you.
Stop it, will you, Norm?
Knock it off.
OK, I'll go out there.
Thanks.
I love you, big guy!
Give her a try first.
If it doesn't work out, we can talk.
If she comes downstairs now and sees you standing there, she'll know you've been there for six hours.
That looks desperate.
So?
That's the way it is, isn't it?
This is what love comes to.
I want to remember this, Sammy.
Somebody take my picture.
Come on, Cliff.
It's on me.
- Sit down.
- I guess you're right.
No more illusions about happiness for me.
I'm going to drink myself into oblivion.
No, you're not.
You'll just have two problems that way.
Why did she stand me up?
That does it.
Now I'll let my grooming and appearance go to hell.
And you think the results will be noticeable?
Thank you, Carla.
I want abuse piled on me tonight.
Maybe I'll get it through my thick head that I'm a loser.
You know what my school nickname was?
- No, you never told us.
- I didn't have one, Coach.
I tried to get one started, made it up myself.
Courteous Cliff.
- Couldn't you have done better?
- I didn't want to arouse suspicion.
There's a tribe of men in the Middle East called the Essenites.
They're celibate and live without women.
Rumour has it that they are the happiest men in the world.
Tomorrow I'm going to send for their brochure.
Hello, Cheers.
No, there's no Ponce de León here.
We don't have Prince Albert in the can.
Coach.
I think that might be for me.
Hello?
Yeah.
Really?
No, I understand.
Yeah, I understand.
OK.
All right.
Bye.
Isn't that something?
She was afraid to meet me without her mask on.
I actually made a woman nervous.
That's incredible, isn't it?
Are you two going get together?
Yeah.
She's at a pay phone across the street.
She said she's coming right over.
- Cliffie, yeah?
- Let's not stand here.
- We'll be up here.
- Come here.
- Thank you.
- We don't want to have to eavesdrop.
So keep your stupid remarks loud.
- Hello.
- Hi.
I'm Club Clifford.
I'm Cliff Clavin.
I'm Hario Share.
Sharon Hair I mean I'm Sharon O'Hare.

{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
SAM TURNS THE OTHER CHEEK - I'm sorry it has to be like this.
- Why?
Back up the garbage truck, Cliffie.
Entering Dump City.
Have a little sensitivity.
That living, feeling human being is about to be blown out of the water.
You want to stand aside?
I can't see anything here.
Sam, I know it's my fault.
I should have said something sooner.
I'm sorry, it's just that I told you, it's a rule with me.
It's the right thing to do.
I think we both realise that.
- I suppose you're right.
- Yes.
- Don't you think that if we worked - Let's make a clean break.
Stop now and we'll still have all those terrific memories.
Now go, go.
- Don't make it any tougher.
- Goodbye, Sam.
Goodbye.
Available in paperback wherever nauseating trash is sold.
You want to tell me what was wrong with that one, Sammy?
- She looked perfect.
Body was a ten.
- So was her face.
So was her IQ.
Sam's kind of girl.
She was married.
She told me just now.
I don't mess around with married women.
Me neither.
It's refreshing to know you draw the line somewhere.
There are three categories of women I don't get involved with - married, underage, and comatose.
He's added one.
- Sam, may I have my purse, please?
- What are you grinning about?
I was just confirming what a fortunate thing it was that you and I split up.
Now my love life is stable and yours belongs in one.
I'll have to share that with Frasier.
Puns are his greatest pleasure.
Now that he's sleeping with you?
Carla, that was a mean-spirited, tasteless insult.
- Why aren't you chortling?
- Leave me alone.
I've got the worst toothache in the history of the world.
Must be an impacted wisdom fang!
Die!
You're going to die!
Why don't you do with a toothache what I did when I played in the minors?
- What's that, Coach?
- See a dentist.
You're right, Coach.
I'll have to go tomorrow.
I got my bad dental habits from my parents.
They taught me to brush after every war.
Coach, how about one for the road?
So, Normie, how's Vera doing?
She's all right, but she's nagging to get a new house.
Having any luck in finding one?
We've got to get rid of the old one first.
I've been thinking about getting another place.
- It's yours.
- I'd like to take a look at it first.
The man's a shrewd buyer, Coach.
- What's wrong with where you're living?
- Nothing, really.
I just thought it's time I got a place of my own.
- Where do you live now?
- You know where I live.
- No, I've never been there.
- I live at home.
- At home?
Whose home?
- My parents'.
No big deal.
Good night.
Parents?
You live with mommy and daddy?
- I I live with my mother, Norm.
- For what?
It's not out of choice.
It's more of a sense of responsibility.
My father abandoned us and I've become the man of the house.
- You've got a curfew?
- Curfew!
Come on, Norm.
I can stay out as long as I call by ten.
- Good night, Sam.
- Good night, Coach.
- I'm sorry, we're closed.
- That's OK.
I'm not a customer.
- I'm looking for Sam Malone.
- You found him.
I'm Maxine's husband.
Not the Sam Malone, a Sam Malone.
- Not the one you're looking for though.
- Why did you do it?
Now, wait, wait!
You just listen to me.
I did not know that she was married.
She just told me today, and the second I found out, I called it off.
That was it.
Ask her.
I may have done a lot of lousy things in my life, but I don't mess around with other men's wives.
- You're saying it's all her fault?
- I'm not saying it's anybody's fault.
It was just a big mistake, that's all.
I know we've all been hurt by this and I'm sorry.
What am I doing?
Who am I kidding?
She's a tramp.
I think I've always known it and I've never admitted it.
You got anything to drink?
I think I got a bottle here, someplace.
- Scotch all right?
- Yes.
bring it over, will you?
You're not a mean drunk, are you?
No, just a stupid one.
Don't flatter yourself thinking that you're the first.
- There have been others.
- Out of curiosity, are they still with us?
- If she just weren't so damn gorgeous.
- Yes, I know.
It's tough being married to a beautiful woman.
You know, tis like that sweet old love ballad says "If you want to be happy for the rest of your life "Never make a pretty woman your wife "From my personal point of view get an ugly girl to marry you" - Remember that?
- I should have listened!
I'm really sorry, Sam.
I've been out of my mind.
- Women!
Look what they bring us to.
- They put you through hell, don't they?
- I get the feeling they enjoy it, too.
- Yes.
Why don't I hold on to this?
Put it someplace where it's not going to do any damage.
I wish I hadn't done that.
- Hey, everybody!
Great day, isn't it?
- Did you get your tooth fixed?
I am never going to be afraid to go to the dentist again.
I've found a way to communicate with him.
As he leaned in with his drill I grabbed him where I could get his attention and I said, "We're not going to hurt each other, are we"?
- All right.
- Carla?
- Did that work?
- We're having a late dinner.
- Sam!
What the hell happened to you?
- Nothing, really.
Nothing at all.
What do you mean?
You come limping in with a cane.
There was a little trouble in the bar last night, but it was no big deal.
What happened, Sam?
Come on.
A thief broke in I had to run him out and I caught a bullet in the leg here.
- A bullet in the leg!
- Come on, it's no big deal.
Let's just go back to our business.
Good Lord, Sam, you grappled with an armed marauder?
- You could have lost your life!
- Well, I guess I could have.
But that's something you only think about afterwards.
Talk about guts!
It had nothing to do with guts, Norm.
It's just reflex.
I am an athlete.
Let's hear it for Mayday.
Another save?
- Will you sit down here?
- No, I think I'll stand.
Sam, you should give us some details.
Details?
All right, that's easy enough.
Well, Coach these guys burst into the bar and they I thought it was just one guy.
No, I just said one guy had a gun that I saw.
They could have all had guns, but when they saw what I did to their pal, they just took off out of there.
- Basically, they were all cowards.
- Amen to that, Sammy.
All right, Coach.
The guy was holding his gun on me and I waited for the right moment and then I kicked out with my leg, kind of like I guess the closest comparison would be Bruce Lee.
I made contact with the gun, he pulled the trigger, the bullet caught my leg and the gun went flying.
And the rest just took off out of there.
Big save!
Come on!
I guess I really shouldn't have done it, but I'll tell you something.
The next time one of those drunk, drugged-out punks decide to break in and take advantage of an honest citizen, they'll think twice about it, I'll tell you.
- You guys!
- Just like the old days, Sam?
Where are you going, Mayday?
Well, I can still dance on it!
I think there's something rotten in the state of Denmark.
It's all that cheese.
- Sam, when you say in the leg - All right, so it wasn't exactly the leg.
- It was a little higher up.
- The important thing is that you're OK.
But exactly how did they manage to shoot you in the "I know what"?
When you're surrounded by marauders with automatic weapons, the bullets When my husband left last night with a gun, I never thought he would Why think of something that had nothing to do with me!
I've got a question for you.
Whatever happened to the metric system?
Weren't we supposed to change all those measuring cups?
That was your act of heroism?
Mayday's moment of truth?
Shot in the fanny while fleeing a jealous husband.
Wait!
Who said I was running away?
How else do you explain the location of your wound?
I could have been coming at him and turned a somersault to throw off his aim.
You're lucky that you didn't get brain damage.
All right, let's get our facts straight.
I did not know she was married.
And I was not running away, I was putting the gun in my back pocket when it went off.
This is a perfect comment on your lifestyle.
- Answer me one question.
- What?
When you went to the doctor, did you ask him to get the lead out?
- Frasier will love that one, won't he?
- Frasier's weekend is made.
Come on, no jokes.
Just do me one favour.
I will not change your dressing.
No, listen, just back me up on this?
If everybody finds out what happened They might make you the butt of their jokes.
- I'll save that one for his birthday.
- Just promise me, will you?
Just don't say anything.
Sure, Sam.
I won't blow your story but I must warn you The bigger the lie, the bigger the fool one might appear later to be.
Well, whatever.
The thing is that I did get a little carried away, but there's no harm done and it's all over.
So, let's just forget it.
Sam?
There's a film crew from the six o'clock news out here.
Gee, I wonder what they want?
Cliffie, are you going to buy Norm's house or not?
You bet, Coach.
Don't tell him I said so, but the building inspector who checked it out says his house is in terrific shape.
Coach, draft, please.
Why wouldn't you tell him a thing like that?
The guy is hot to sell.
I'm going to low-ball him on this one and he's going to end up looking like a giant sap.
Clifford!
I can't believe my ears.
Gee, and I've never believed your hair or your nose.
What does that leave us?
You would take advantage of your best friend?
Friendship has its place, but not in business.
Especially in real estate where it's strictly dog-eat-dog.
One fidoburger coming up!
Norm!
Could I have your ear for a second?
Despite my building inspector's protest, I've decided to put a bid on your house.
There it is.
That's going have to be my top offer.
- You got yourself a deal!
- Hey!
What?
- Everybody, I sold the house!
- Normie sold the house.
I can look at that place with the pool room.
- That's an eight there.
- An eight!
I thought it was a two!
At last, English-speaking neighbours.
What don't I know about this house?
- The market value.
- That paper's not notarised, Norm.
It was an honour meeting Boston's newest hero.
Did anybody ever tell you you were like Gary Cooper?
- Yup!
- Good night.
Great place.
- Thanks very much.
- What a night!
- What will you do with all that money?
- I'm going spend it all on my kids.
Good girl!
How many gunny sacks and one-way tickets do you think it'll buy?
Gee, I don't know, Carla.
- Why are you looking at me like that?
- Never mind.
Come on.
What's the problem?
You're living a lie, Sam.
I know you won't listen to me but our parents were right when they said, "No one profits by deceit.
" Sorry, Diane, tonight's receipts are making too much noise.
I can't hear you.
I honestly don't care what you do, but I must say I'm a little disappointed.
You're sure you don't want to hang around, get naked and roll around in all my money?
You're no fun any more.
- Hello again, Sam.
- Hello, Marvin.
How are you doing?
- This thing has turned out good for you.
- Yeah.
I saw you on TV.
There you were, the scum who was messing around with my wife.
- And they're treating you like a hero.
- You want to stop pointing guns at me?
Sam Don't mind me, just carry on as if I weren't here.
- You're not going anywhere.
- Come on, Marvin.
- Let her go.
- So she can call the police?
The police?
Obviously you don't know me.
There's too much government interference in our lives as it is.
- Get back here.
- This is crazy.
I was already shot once.
- We're even.
- No, Sam, we're not even.
Not yet.
I can't sleep, I can't eat, I can't work!
All I can think about is you and my wife Diane, isn't that a run in your stocking?
My!
You're right!
What a nasty run.
Look at that.
Just put some nail polish on it.
I don't think nail polish will work on a run this large and high up on one's thigh.
- Do you, Marvin?
- Look, shut up!
Just working a cramp out.
There you go.
- You'd better not try that again.
- Don't worry.
- Move over here.
- Excuse me, Marvin?
Listen to me.
You're having trouble with your marriage, aren't you?
- Believe me, I understand how you feel.
- Nobody understands how I feel.
- I do!
- Sure, sure!
- You ever been in love with trash?
- Yes!
This disgusting pile right here.
Exactly.
He's trash.
But I love him with all my heart.
Why?
Because I've got to.
You tell me.
Why do you love her?
Because neither one of us can help it.
But I'm asking you as a favour from one sucker to another, don't waste my fella.
- Sam, is this true?
You and her?
- Yeah, absolutely.
- I don't deserve her, but who does?
- And what do we get for loving them?
A punch in the face, a kick in the gut, a one-way ticket to Heartbreak City.
He's a stockbroker.
Why are you talking like that?
Lady, you're right.
You know exactly how I feel.
The biggest favour I could do for this lady is to shoot you.
Way to go, sweetheart.
Actually, we're not that close.
- Just an occasional movie date.
- I won't shoot you.
You know why?
Because it would hurt her more than it would you.
- Thank you.
- Yes, thank you.
If you ever get tired of him and you want someone who can give you a nice, quiet home life, think of me.
Mighty attractive offer.
I don't believe this.
You just saved my life with that ridiculous story.
I'm not sure I know what to do to thank you.
I can think of something.
But I don't think you're prepared to do it.
Come on, of course I am.
Let's just go in my office here.
Unfortunately, I'm injured, so you're going to have to do most of the work.
- Good night, Sam.
- I was kidding!
I know what you're thinking about.
You want me to set the record straight about what happened the other night.
Right?
All right, I will.
I'm going to call the newspaper right now.
- I didn't ask you to do that.
- I know, but I'm going to.
This is important.
Because your respect for me is important to me.
I always pretend it isn't, but the truth is, I want you to think I'm a good person.
- Really, Sam?
- Really.
Sometimes you surprise me, Mr Malone.
- And that's wonderful.
- Yeah.
Hello, can I speak to the City Desk, please?
Is anyone else in?
Who am I speaking to then?
All right, Emily, this is Sam Malone and I'm calling because I You heard about that?
Listen, the thing is that a lot of people have been making a big deal I'd like to meet you, too.
What time do you get off work?
No, 4:00 am, that's no problem for me.
That's great, yeah.
Well Afraid?
Emily, I'd be lying if I said that I wasn't, but the You're not married, are you?

{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
COACH IN LOVE Last call.
- Will you wake Norm?
- It's not necessary.
One more and I'm a memory.
- Coming right up.
- How long was I asleep?
Couple of hours.
You dropped off during Cliff's travelogue.
Lucky you.
Any subject you bring up, he uses as an opening.
At least before he went to Florida he was boring on a wide range of topics.
- Cool it, he's coming.
- Don't you say anything.
Hey, look at this.
He is risen.
He was snoring away for quite a while there, wasn't he, Carla?
Well, another day shot.
I'll slip off to the hciend and close the peepers.
- Good night.
- Later.
It's not really later in Florida.
It's a popular misconception.
It's Eastern Standard Daylight Time down there, too.
Speaking of time, it stops still in the Everglades.
They have huge gators.
That's what those familiar with Florida call alligators.
They have huge gators and crocs.
You know what a croc is?
Oh, yeah.
The first morning there was crystalline.
As I stepped out of the hydrofoil, the captain, Billy Bob Dupre, asked me not to bring the beach umbrella.
It got caught in the prop - Hi, I'm here.
Better late than never.
- That wouldn't be my choice.
- Sorry, Sam.
Traffic was awful.
- That's OK.
What have we got here?
Just some things some things you forgot a few months ago.
To be opened later privately and very discretely.
My pants!
Where did you find them, in your bedroom?
A little louder for the people in the Ukraine who didn't hear.
There's more.
How did you get along without your Snoopy toothbrush?
Nice, Sammy.
Mr Tooth Decay better watch out now, Sam.
Four out of five dentists rate this right at the top.
I trust you'll return the favour.
I may have left things at your place.
- I'm sure I left my beige sweater.
- No problem.
But you can keep that hand puppet you loved.
- Hand puppet?
- Yes, Brian the Lion.
Oh, yeah.
Brian the Lion.
You were touched that I gave you something from my childhood.
Yes, extremely.
I'll give you five bucks to run out right now.
- You got it.
- No, take this Brian?
By golly, in this light, it does look a little bit like Brian.
Brian the Lion, a bar rag?
You are the most insensitive boob I have had the misfortune to run across.
It wasn't meant to work out between me and Brian.
I wasn't cut out to be a puppeteer.
That's got to be a tough thing for a man to admit in public.
Oh, come on.
Come on, please, Diane.
Don't be mad at me.
Please?
- Well - Please?
- I guess I'm overreacting.
- Good, then how about a little kiss?
- OK.
- And put some tongue in it.
That'll be five bucks for my mad dash.
What was that all about?
Brian the Lion was my dearest childhood pal.
Then being a grimy bar rag should be a step up.
It's a fact the word "Florida" comes from Okefenokee Indians and means "place where the old people come to sweat".
Sam, did you see the lady there in the green dress?
- I'm going to marry her.
- Marry her?
I'm going to marry her.
- What's her name?
- I don't know.
It doesn't matter.
It's what we Italians call "the thunderbolt".
The same thing happened when I first laid eyes on my Angela.
- Aren't you jumping the gun a little?
- Honest, I know what I know.
Norm, do you think I should go and introduce myself?
I think it's best.
It eliminates that awkward first meeting at the altar.
Coach, that is the most romantic thing I have ever heard in this bar.
- Thank you, Diane.
- Wait.
What about when I invited you to my nude limbo party?
- Christmas Eve was a bad time for it.
- Maybe so.
Trouble is, you're a little outnumbered over there.
You need somebody to run interference with her friend.
You're right.
Sam, would you go with me?
Sam would have been my pick.
Coach, I'm going to be blunt.
Her friend's cute, but isn't what I'm looking for.
What's that, breakaway clothes?
No, she just looks a little too tame for me, that's all.
Look at it from my point of view.
I only have so many nights.
I'd trade all of mine for one of yours.
- No, you wouldn't.
- Oh, yes.
I'd throw in my left lung, too.
Would you please come with me?
- Boy, the things I do for you, Coach.
- Thank you, Sam.
I haven't done this in such a long time.
My hands are sweating.
Thank you, Sam.
I'll tell you what you used to tell me when I was nervous.
- What?
- Blow it and I don't know you.
I should have written some of those things down.
Let's go.
Good evening.
My name's Sam Malone and this is my friend, Ernie Pantusso.
You can call him Coach.
We were wondering if you ladies could settle a bet for us.
Are you two sisters?
My name's Irene Blanchard and this is my daughter, Sue Blanchard.
- How are you?
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
We don't mean to intrude.
Are you waiting for your husbands?
No, neither of us is married.
Well, I'll see what I can do about that.
- Would you care to join us?
- Well, thank you, why not?
- Are you out on the town?
- No, we dropped by to rob the place.
Everybody do as they say and nobody will get hurt!
That was a joke.
I really enjoy a sense of humour.
With me it's an absolute must.
Is that a player piano over there?
Coach, that was not a joke.
Well, I like a serious side to someone, too.
- Yes, that is a player piano.
- Would you like to see it?
I haven't seen one since I was a teenager.
- When was that, last summer?
- Mr Pantusso, you're a sly one.
I could think you were trying to steal my heart.
I'd rather have it given to me.
Come on.
- I'm not going too fast for you, am I?
- No.
I'm just waiting for an opening.
Opening?
You could drive a truck through this one.
Well, here we are Man, woman.
Cool evening breeze, full moon.
Need I say more?
Only if you want me to know what you're talking about.
Sorry, that was my cute way of inviting you to an evening of romance.
Well, that's a very tempting offer, but Mother and I haven't been out for months.
I understand.
Just my luck.
If you change your mind, there'll be a moonbeam with our name on it.
Ernie wants to take me to dinner at his favourite restaurant.
You and I have had dinner together every night this week.
Very funny book.
Don't wait up.
Sam, this is OK with you, isn't it?
- Sam?
Is this OK with you?
- Oh, yeah.
Good night.
Don't worry.
I'll have her back by Thursday.
You did say you and Mom hadn't been out to dinner for months?
Yes, I'm afraid I've been caught in a lie.
You were lying to get out of dating me?
I'm sorry.
I was only trying to let you down easy.
You were trying to let me down easy?
- Mr Malone, you're not my type.
- I'm not your type?
- You're not adding a lot to this chat.
- I'm not adding a lot to this chat!
Really, I'm sorry.
What can I say?
The initial attraction just isn't there.
Hey, no problem.
Are you kidding me?
I was just helping out my pal.
You're not my type either.
- No harm done.
- No, none.
There's nothing going on.
No magic, no spark, no reason to continue.
What are you doing tomorrow?
I'm not doing anything tomorrow, but what does it matter?
- I'm not interested in you.
- Right.
We established that.
Thursday?
Friday?
Saturday?
Hey!
I don't want to go out with you!
OK, Norm, so he blew one.
He's not a god.
- He was to me.
- There, there.
My world doesn't make sense any more.
What went wrong?
Boy, if you ask me, that girl's got a big problem.
You're right.
It's called good taste.
- There you go.
- That explains it.
It's the bottom of the ninth with two outs.
The Sox need a miracle here tonight.
- Carla, the Sox are rallying.
- I've sworn off those losers forever.
I am not interested.
I retract everything!
Go Sox!
Oh, God!
You know, I don't ask for much in this life.
Fresh fish.
Ten cents off on laundry detergent.
Volcanic boils all over my ex-husband.
And the Sox in the Series again before I die.
- You're a good woman.
- Shove it!
Sam, did you remember my sweater?
Your I'm sorry, I forgot again.
I promise I'll bring it in.
Please.
I remind you every night.
Well, it gives me a chance to throw it in the machine.
Don't throw it in the washer.
It's hand spun lamb's wool.
It'll shrink up to nothing.
It'll shrink.
I'm glad we had this talk.
I didn't realise that.
Since I have to part with that sweater, could you tell me where I might get one exactly like it?
I bought it in Ireland years ago.
It's one of a kind.
So if a guy spent the morning visiting department stores, he'd be wasting his time?
Oh, I'm sorry!
I'm sorry.
It's clean.
Sam, how could you?
Come on now, Diane.
Don't be small about this.
I hate you!
- Don't you want this?
- What in the world is it good for?
Did you see that movie "The Incredible Shrinking Woman"?
I pray to God it never happens to you, but you never know.
I think I know somebody who's in love.
Good, buy them a beer, Cliff, so am I. - I meant you.
- I don't need a beer.
I'm just too happy as it is.
Sorry things with Sue didn't work out.
Don't worry about it.
Who needs that walking Frigidaire?
Just goes to show love can strike anywhere, anytime.
It doesn't ask your name or your age.
It asks How big are your bazongas?
The beauty of this moment was lost on you.
Haven't you realised there is a difference between the Coach's ffire de coeur and your animal cravings?
Tap your cloven hoof twice for "yes".
- Coach, isn't it your night off tonight?
- Yeah.
I'm taking Irene to Melville's for dinner.
It's expensive up north there.
I've been saving.
This is a very special evening.
It's wonderful you two found each other.
You radiate such bliss.
You know why?
Because we've so much in common.
We both love music and Italian food.
She's a widow, I'm a widower.
She's a hairdresser, I've got hair.
And get this, neither of us have ever been to Utah.
Oh, scary!
Norm, check what the back of my neck looks like.
Every hair at attention.
Except for that one.
Snap to, Mr!
I've only known her for three weeks, but this is the night.
I'm going to ask her to marry me.
- You're kidding me!
- All right!
You devil!
You've been single for a long time.
- You're sure?
- I'm sure.
You know something?
Even my Angela would have liked her.
- Don't you think?
- I think she would.
I figured, why put it off?
We're not kids any more.
I don't quite know how to ask her, but anybody have any suggestions?
The only proposal I heard was Nick's.
It worked, honey.
What did he say?
"Carla, I knocked you up, you know where I live, so I guess I have to.
" Not bad.
Moving on to the higher primates Normie, how did you propose to Vera?
Well, I You know something?
I don't think I did.
- Could there be a loophole?
- Not if you consummated it.
Egad!
Why couldn't we have had this conversation yesterday?
I've written down a few ideas and they will have to do.
But, Normie, should I ask her before we order?
I don't want to ask with something in my teeth, especially if it's green.
Play it safe.
Drape a napkin over your head.
Not bad.
Hi, Ernie.
Are you ready for the best dinner of your life?
Ernie, every dinner I have with you is better than the one before it.
Every Wednesday up at Melville's the vegetable is spinach.
Spinach is green and you know what that means.
So please sit down.
I've got a couple of questions.
What I want to say is, oh, wait a minute I got it.
Irene I'm not a rich man.
I'm not a young man.
I'm not a handsome man.
I'm not a tall man.
I'm not a strong man.
I'm not a talented man.
I'm not a well-travelled man.
I'm not a smart man.
I'm not a milkman.
I'm not a gingerbread man.
I'm What are you trying to say?
I don't need a piece of paper to tell you my feelings.
Irene Well, maybe I do.
I'm not a rich man.
I'm not a young Coach!
Look, Irene, what I'm trying to say is, I love you and I want you to marry me, but I can't find the words.
Ernie, you've said all you need to.
- I'd love to be your wife.
- She said yes!
It's time for the bartender to pour some champagne.
- I'm sorry, Sam.
- No, no, Coach.
I got it.
There have been many celebrations in this bar, but none as joyous and as inspiring as what we are experiencing here.
Wasn't it Swinburne who said I'll get it!
Guys, I'm the bartender.
Well, hello, Sue.
Irene, it's your daughter.
Well, this is a surprise.
I've been expecting this call for a long time.
OK, commence begging.
Sam, Sam Malone.
Yeah, she's here.
She wants to talk to you.
Sam, you seem to be working hard to get a date with a woman who obviously wouldn't cross the street to spit in your hair.
Don't worry, she will when she gets to know me.
- What's wrong, sweetheart?
- I just I can't believe it.
Ernie, I won the lottery!
Two million dollars!
My God!
Two million bucks!
- I think I'm a little woozy.
- Sam, get some brandy.
Yeah, make it the good stuff.
She can afford it.
Look, Irene, don't tell me that was the only ticket you ever bought.
- It's a deal.
- I knew it!
Sam!
I think we ought to have a drink.
- I'm buying!
- I thought of that, too.
I can't believe it.
I'm stinking rich!
I'd better tell Vic we're going to be a little late.
Oh, boy, what a night!
My goodness!
How about that, Irene?
- What a night for you.
- Magic!
Two such wonderful developments.
Yes, I won the lottery!
And what was the other thing?

{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
COACH IN LOVE You got any fresh coffee?
Great.
Carla, I hate to criticise, but I can't believe you actually read these sleazy scandal sheets.
Look at this.
Even I'm above this.
"Big Foot Stole My Wife.
" "Have Aliens Taken Over Your Pet"?
This is garbage!
For your information, I don't read those articles.
I think they're just as stupid as you do.
I get it because they happen to have a great crossword puzzle.
OK, let's see.
Seven across.
Five-headed cow born in Vermont.
Maybelle.
State with the most UFO babies.
- Arkansas.
- I don't believe it.
found in every kitchen cabinet.
I don't know what that one is.
Let me see what 14 down is.
Where Franco's brain is being kept alive.
Fish tank.
OK, so, the fifth letter of the aphrodisiac is an A. Now I remember.
Oregano.
Trash.
Hi, sweetheart.
Don't look at me like that.
I know we haven't spent much time together, but a lot's been happening down at Cheers.
Let me grab a beer.
Irene Blanchard walks into the bar a few weeks ago.
Coach falls for her like a ton of bricks.
Like when we first laid eyes on each other.
He's taking her out on the town and they've seen each other every night.
So it wasn't unexpected when Coach comes in tonight Hey, I saw that yawn.
Well, I can finish this story tomorrow.
Come on, let's you and me turn in.
No!
You'll wake up Vera.
- Norm?
- Be right up, dear.
You stupid dog.
I hope she's not in the mood to talk or anything.
- Antony, everything under control?
- You think the place would be on fire?
I was worried, this being your first time watching the kids alone.
- Yeah, I know, but it was no sweat.
- That's my little man.
Yuck.
It feels good to get off my feet.
Where are the kids?
- Locked in the hall closet.
- Let them out!
- Sure, Ma.
- I didn't say now.
Would you like another piece of pie, Cliffie?
I shouldn't, but I can't resist your gooseberry pie, Mom.
Wipe your chin.
That's a good boy.
Did you have a nice time tonight at Cheers?
- Yeah, it was OK.
- Did you meet any young ladies?
No, but there was some excitement.
I told you about the Coach and Irene?
Tonight he asked her to marry him and she said yeah.
Then she gets a call from her daughter and Irene's won the lottery.
- Two million smackers.
- Good Lord.
We're kind of worried, though.
She forgot about Coach when she won that dough.
Maybe it'll work out.
When are you taking me to Cheers to meet your friends?
- When hell freezes over.
- What?
When the front seat of the car is fixed.
Fine.
- Hello.
- What are you wearing?
- Frasier.
- I'm not Frasier.
I'm not wearing anything.
Does that excite you?
Frasier, I know it's you.
It's very late.
- You always know it's me.
- You always do the same thing.
I just called to say I love you.
You're the most thoughtful boyfriend I've ever had.
That's not saying much.
Speaking of Sam This is good.
The woman Coach has been seeing, Irene, has a daughter, Sue.
When they came in, Sam offered to pick up Sue so Coach would be with Irene.
But she turned him down flat.
The best thing is it's been bugging Sam.
Then tonight she did it again.
I hate to admit it, but I'm enjoying it.
You little devil.
My dearest, I will bid you good night.
By the way I really don't have any clothes on.
This phone booth is freezing.
Good night, Frasier, darling.
Sweet dreams.
Good Lord, aren't all the eight-year-olds in bed by now?
Good, some late news.
Let's see what's on the old tube here.
I watched some news over the weekend.
That's good enough, I guess.
Great!
I love this one!
They're doctors!
Found something else of yours lying around my place.
- Remember this?
- Good Lord.
- For wearing or signalling aircraft?
- This is your teddy, isn't it?
I don't know which of your mindless bimbi left that in your apartment.
If she paid money for it, she should be seen to and chemically altered.
- You don't like the colour?
- What made you think that was mine?
You're the only person I know that shops at those fancy French places.
The House of Ooh La La.
Get it away from me.
It's horrendous.
This is lovely.
- Do you want it?
- Me?
I can't take this, Sam.
- Please, go ahead.
- God, thanks.
From the House of Ooh La La!
- Evening, everybody.
- Norm!
Tell us what you know, Norm.
God's in his heaven and something, something, something.
- How about a beer?
- Yeah, that's it.
Your Florida tan is far deeper, far richer, than your ordinary run-of-the-mill tan.
I've got a patch over here.
I'll show you the distinction.
I see Cliff found somebody he hasn't bored to death with his Florida spiel yet.
Marco Polo didn't talk about his trip this much.
- You see how the rayon sock - Gee, it's seven o'clock!
You wonder where the evening's gone.
- I'll remember where I was.
- So will I. Nice guy.
- So, where's the Coach?
- He's in the back working.
I understand Irene postponed the wedding again.
- What does that make?
Three times.
- A Stoly rocks, Sam.
He hasn't seen much of her since she became Miss Moneybags.
Woman!
They're only good for one thing.
And for you, not even that.
I'm kind of worried.
This doesn't seem to faze Coach.
He's going on like nothing happened.
- It's like he's got his head in the sand.
- Did my fiancée call, Sam?
- No, Coach, not today.
- When she does, I'll be in the back.
Hey, Coach, wait a second here.
Let me have a little talk with you.
Everything's all right with you and Irene?
Yeah, sure, never better.
I hear she changed the wedding date again.
What's the story?
- It's just nerves, Sam.
It's only natural.
- But you've hardly seen her lately.
Well, she's been making all these wedding plans.
I'm not worried about it.
Coach, she moved and she didn't tell you where.
Well, I am a little worried about that, but with all the excitement, she probably forgot.
Coach, listen to me.
I'm going to tell you straight and you'd better listen to me.
Before you do, could I ask a very special favour of you?
- What?
- Would you please be my best man?
Coach, sure.
I'd be proud to.
Thanks, Sam.
Now if I can just clear this with Irene.
- What does she care?
- No, it's not Irene.
It's Sue.
If you showed up at the wedding, she said something about hiring a sniper.
She can't stop thinking about me.
Obviously, little Miss Sue has a bad case of Sammy-itis.
Sometimes known as the swine flu.
Sam, admit it.
The poor woman had a low threshold for overbearing bores.
I got an idea.
Maybe I could send her a relief map of my body.
Or you could send her a life-sized portrait of your brain.
I know a good miniaturist.
No, that's not sexy enough.
Hi, everyone.
Is Ernie here?
I'd like to talk to him.
He'll be honoured you remember his name.
Carla, come on.
Stay out of this.
Somebody here to see you!
- Is it Irene?
- Yeah, it is.
I haven't seen you since proposing.
How are the wedding plans going?
- That's what I want to talk about, Ernie.
- Did you want to move the date up?
- Ernie, would you please sit down?
- Sure, come on.
- Do you know where I was tonight?
- Probably at home, wherever that is.
I went to the Governor's mansion for dinner.
Holy mackerel!
I guess you didn't think I'd want to go.
The point is, since I won that money, I've been meeting new people.
Experiencing new things.
And there's a lot more I still want to do.
I'm talking about Paris, Monaco, London.
- I'd be perfectly happy with Six Flags.
- I know you would.
Ernie, this is really This is very hard for me.
I wouldn't want to hurt you for the world, but the plain truth is I'm not the same person I was three weeks ago.
That person loved you.
You're a good man, but I've been married to a good man.
I've never been obscenely wealthy.
Money changes people, Ernie.
It hasn't changed me.
I'm engaged to a very wealthy woman, but I'm still the same simple guy I always was.
Ernie, I don't think we're engaged any more.
I'm sorry.
I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me.
There's nothing to forgive.
This isn't you talking, it's the money.
You've got to get this out of your system and you'll come back to me.
- I wish I could make you understand.
- Look, we set a wedding date, right?
That date is still set.
When that date comes, I'll be waiting for you.
Goodbye, Ernie.
Have a wonderful life.
You're crazy.
This isn't goodbye.
- Yes, it is.
- It isn't.
It is.
She's going to make one hell of a wife, ain't she?
Isn't it romantic?
Yeah, that's what I like.
A nice clean break.
Coach, pretty spiffy there.
What's the occasion?
My wedding day.
Some cologne, please.
- You heard from Irene?
- Not for a while.
But you're not supposed to see the bride before the ceremony.
No, but you're supposed to know whether or not she's in the country.
Sam, will you stop worrying about every little thing, like countries?
- All right.
- This is a very happy day.
Folks Folks, I have an apology to make.
A lot of you can't be invited to the wedding because it's going to be a small private affair.
- Sorry some of you had to be left out.
- Like the bride.
That really hurts.
Then I haven't lived in vain.
Diane, I'm sorry, but you can't sing at the wedding like you offered to.
I understand.
Just standing there looking geeky will be entertainment enough.
Sam, I'm going to check on my honeymoon reservation.
The Coach is headed for Dump City.
He's got his pedal to the metal.
I still say there's something touching about it.
A man with that much hope and faith in a relationship is very rare.
So's the oxygen to your brain.
You're not helping him saying stuff like that.
We've got to get him to face reality.
Diane, you of all people should realise how painful it is to love somebody who doesn't love you back.
Yes, your sobbing, your whimpering, your moony-eyed sighs have not gone unnoticed.
You must have dreamt that about me.
So the dreams about me continue?
Still have the one about the white horse?
One end of it.
Sam, the day I met Frasier Crane, I stopped looking for Mr Right.
That would discourage me, too.
Why don't you two hit each other in the face or shut up?
- We're trying to deal with the Coach.
- You're right.
But is it wrong for a man to believe the woman he loves will come back?
Yes, when the chances that she will are none.
I'm sure if Irene knew how strongly the Coach still felt, she'd make an effort to talk to him and straighten him out.
We don't know how to get in touch with her.
But I know how to get in touch with her daughter, Miss Frost bottom.
I'll give her a message to pass on to her mother and she can keep a little of it for herself.
A message about how a couple of women that don't know the first thing about being decent to folks Hi, Babe, Sam Malone.
Busy tonight?
For the rest of your life.
I thought that's what you'd say, but before you hang up on me here, this doesn't have anything to do with you.
It's about your mother and the way she's treated the Coach.
It stinks.
I don't want to say how enraged I am over the phone, so how about dinner tonight?
I knew you would say that, but listen up.
I don't want to go to dinner.
I already ate.
So, how about a drink?
I knew you would say that, too, but I got news.
I don't drink.
So who feels stupid now?
You agree with me?
You should be ashamed of your mother, Sue.
What's going on here?
Corfu?
Yeah, thanks.
I'm beginning to hate the women in that family.
What is it?
Irene's engaged to another man, some hotshot foreign industrialist millionaire.
Said his name was Glods or something.
Stanislaw Glods?
What a catch.
Anyway, she's living with him in Corfu, wherever the hell that is.
Corfu.
Poor man's Pensacola.
- Here he comes.
- Don't anybody say anything.
- Any calls?
- No, Coach.
- You mean Irene didn't call?
- I don't think Irene's going to call ever.
Sam, you're so young.
Hey, Coach, she's engaged to another man.
I just spoke to her daughter.
Some rich European guy.
Heavens to Betsy!
I've been left at the altar!
What shall I do?
Coach, will you wake up and smell the coffee?
- Take it easy, will you?
- Coach, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to yell at you.
Forgive me.
It's OK, honey.
Up until a few moments ago, I, too, was a holdout for a happy ending.
But even this seemingly incontrovertible evidence hasn't shaken your faith a fig.
- How can you be so certain?
- Right here, Diane.
The heart, who knows how it works?
It's essentially an involuntary muscle, activated by electrical impulses Exactly!
No one!
It works by feelings, Diane.
All my feelings tell me that she'll be back.
You understand?
She'll be back here before closing time.
Nothing's sadder than a man holding on to a dead dream.
Unless it's a blonde struggling to keep her hopes up.
No, I think it's a tall ex-baseball player who clings for How about the three of us go out and get something to eat, like old times?
I thought I knew her.
I was so sure she'd come back today.
Maybe she had a family crisis, like her daughter fell off her broomstick.
How about a pizza?
You love pizza.
No, I don't.
You can't crawl in bed with a pizza.
Well, maybe you could, but a pizza can't keep you warm.
Maybe it could, but you can't kiss a pizza.
Your lips would get Coach, we get the point.
- You know what really hurts the most?
- What?
I thought up to the last moment she'd call.
How could I have been so wrong?
You wanted it to happen so badly you never thought it wouldn't.
No, Diane.
I never doubted it.
I thought we'd get together.
But I guess the money did change her.
I guess it did.
You want to know something?
I'm wondering if we would have made that good a couple.
Come on, let's get some pizza.
Boy, life with her sure ain't boring.
Coach, don't answer that phone.
We both know that it's Irene, but why not teach her a lesson?
No, Diane.
If she was thoughtful enough to call Look, honey, let me do the talking.
If I hear your voice, I may change my mind.
You're better off with the rich guy.
I realise that even if you don't.
Now, look, we had some good times, just take care of yourself.
I hope she understands.
Coach, wait a second here.
Did you actually hear her voice on the phone?
I didn't have to, Sam.
It was her.
- So it's all over?
- Well, it's all over for me.
I still feel sorry for her.
Poor kid.
It's her.

DIANE MEETS MOM - Hello.
- Hi, what can I get you?
- I'm a phone company repairman.
- I'm a bartender.
Ernie Pantusso.
Phil Ryan.
I got a call to come down here.
There must be some mistake, Phil.
I didn't call for any repairman.
- I think Sam put in a call, Coach.
- He did?
He didn't say anything to me.
I'd better give him a call and find out what this is all about.
Bum luck, Phil, phone's out.
Give him a couple of seconds.
I hate to impose, but since they got you here on this royal goose chase, would you take a look at the phone?
- Sure.
- Thank you.
Lucky thing he happened by here.
Sometimes fate takes a hand, Coach.
Hi, everybody.
I bet you're surprised to see me on my night off.
Yeah, we didn't hear your broom pull up.
What are you doing here?
I'm having dinner upstairs with Frasier and his mother.
She's a seafood aficionado, we think she'll like the bouillabaisse.
You're having dinner with Frasier's mother?
You deduced I'm having dinner with Frasier and his mother when all I did was say it in your presence.
No flash cards, no crib notes on your sleeve?
Uncanny.
We're a little edgy tonight, aren't we?
But I can't blame you.
Meeting Mom is a big step in a relationship.
Granted, meeting your prospective fiancé's mother, especially an eminent psychiatrist, trained to analyse a person's behaviour, could be a nerve-racking evening, for somebody who's going to be there, but I'm not.
Good night.
- Chickening out, Diane?
- Not at all.
They're 12 seconds late.
Get back here.
Sit down and have a glass of wine.
Coach Sit down, honey, and relax.
Everything will be fine.
Just remember, don't snap your gum, don't chew with your mouth open, and for God's sake, don't play with your bra straps.
- I'll try to remember.
- Trying's not good enough.
I'll have to write it down for you.
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!
- What would you say to a nice beer?
- Going down.
Coach, do me a favour and don't make a big fuss over me today, OK?
- You got it.
- No cakes, candles, party hats, singing.
- None of that.
- OK.
You know, because it would be so embarrassing.
And no gifts, all right?
And don't ask how old I am today.
Normie, is today your birthday?
Coach, you remembered?
Everybody, it's Normie's birthday.
Let me buy the birthday boy a drink.
Please, you're making too big a deal out of this.
There you are, my darling.
At last you two meet.
The woman who gave me life and the woman who gives me life.
Oh, Frasier.
Forgive me.
I lose my head in the company of beautiful women.
- Dr Crane - Oh, please, dear, call me Hester.
- Hester, it's a pleasure.
- It's my pleasure.
Let me take your coat, Mother.
Diane - Here's the list of tips I promised.
- Thank you, Coach.
I also added instructions for a dainty way to dispose of gristle.
Frasier, she's lovely.
He's made no secret of the fact, but even he didn't do you justice.
Well, in an anxiety-provoking situation such as this, one tends to respond with exaggerated compliments.
Let me just be frank.
You are the most strikingly handsome woman I've ever laid eyes on.
Something exciting is happening here.
Exciting, but not surprising.
I say by the end of the evening you two will be thick as thieves.
Only if we can't resist the temptation to pig out on cheesecake.
- Hey, Doc, Vic's ready for you upstairs.
- I hope everybody's got an appetite.
I'll never eat again.
Let me hurry on up and make sure we've got a good table.
I'm thick with Vic.
Well, Mother - Boy, did you see that?
- What?
Frasier purposely avoided drawing me into the conversation.
I noticed that, too, Cliffie.
What's his problem?
He knows how well versed I am in his field, Coach.
I've embarrassed many a professional so-called expert.
Actually, Cliff, I think you've embarrassed everybody you know.
As long as you're saying it, it's not bragging.
- Norm!
When did you get here?
- 36 years ago today.
- It's my buddy Norm's birthday today.
- Is that right?
I think the birthday of one of my best customers deserves some bubbly.
- No, no, no.
- Maybe you're right.
- Just kidding!
- You got me!
Open this up, Coach.
Congratulations, and many happy returns.
Just don't go singing "Happy Birthday".
Cos I'd really hate that, if you sang "Happy Birthday".
Yeah, just because it is my Cut it out!
Come on, now!
- Norm!
- Are you OK?
- You OK, buddy?
- Yeah, yeah.
I'm all right.
That sucker nearly hit me.
Hold still now.
Why don't you sit down here for a second?
- You all right?
- Yeah.
- How many fingers?
- Three.
- Not you, Coach.
- Three.
Sure, after I give him the answer.
- You sure?
- I'm fine.
The primary symptom of postprandial trauma is the blurring of the metatarsals.
- Cliff, shut up.
- Fine, I'll shut up.
Go ahead and wallow in ignorance.
We're re-entering the Dark Ages.
- Do we gain an hour or lose an hour?
- Would you guys cut it out?
Why don't you see a doctor?
That thing hit you pretty hard.
Play it safe, go to the emergency room.
I'll pay for it.
No, it doesn't even hurt any more.
Normie's right.
I got hit all the time in baseball.
I never saw a doctor.
- You'll keep my glass chilled?
- Yeah.
Yeah, terrific, Normie, I'll pass that on.
Everybody, Normie's just fine.
They're just keeping him in overnight for a few more tests.
A lot of people miss the whimsy in Jung.
He's given me many a chuckle.
I wrote one of my favourite papers on it.
It's entitled, "Hello, Jung Lovers.
" How clever.
Oh, dear.
I hope I haven't dominated the conversation tonight.
Nonsense, the wine and your verbiage went perfectly with our meal.
Listen, why don't you two have a seat and I'll get us a fine cordial.
Will you trust me to make the selection?
I have a little treat in mind, I'd like to surprise you with it.
Frasier, you're mad, but I love you.
Three cans of Schlitz.
Listen carefully.
Stop seeing my son or, as God is my witness, I'll kill you.
- Something to munch on.
- Yum, yum, yum.
Now listen to me.
I have a gun, I know how to use it.
Here we are.
Doesn't that look lovely?
What do you call it?
- It's a delightful pear liqueur.
- Sounds delicious, doesn't it, Diane?
I think she likes it.
I hate to leave your company again, but I must visit the men's room.
You know what they say, you only rent a Château Lafite Rothschild.
I'll go with you.
Diane, there are some things a man must do alone.
If you love me, you won't do this now.
Well, it's a peculiar test of a man's affection, but I think I'm up to it.
I've just had an inspiration.
What say we go to an intimate cabaret and hear some jazz?
That's a wonderful idea, Frasier.
How do you feel about it, Diane?
Diane, you're white as a sheet.
Are you OK?
I'm a little tired, Frasier.
- Why don't you two go without me?
- We wouldn't think of it.
No, I insist.
I'll be fine.
I'll call a cab.
I wouldn't want to spoil your fun.
Please.
She's tired.
Don't press her.
Go home, dear.
Rest.
You need a night on the town like you need a hole in the head.
I'll be fine, thank you.
Very well.
I'll call you later.
- How did dinner go?
- She wants to kill me.
You've got to start picking up some checks, Diane.
Sam, I have to ask you a question.
And promise me you won't make a joke out of it.
OK?
- I promise.
What's up?
- Do you think I'm crazy?
Yes.
Now the joke is out of the way, will you help me?
I know this is a strange question, but it's important.
Do you think I'm crazy?
Yes.
You're incapable of a rational conversation, only flip remarks.
Wait a minute.
Do you mean are you crazy, like seriously unbalanced, like losing your grasp on reality?
- Yes.
- Oh, well, then yes.
When you're ready to discuss this as an adult, then we will talk.
Do I sense a bit of tension between you and dear old Mother Crane?
I don't want to blow this out of proportion.
Doesn't every woman feel their mother-in-law-to-be is an evil, dark-hearted, psychotic murderess?
- I mean competitor.
- What exactly did she say?
I don't remember it word for word.
Something about, "I have a gun and I know how to use it.
" Before she left, she said I needed a night on the town like a hole in the head.
That's kinda cute.
You think a death threat is cute?
Not as a rule, no.
But your sense of humour is not exactly your strong point.
Is it possible that this lady is joking with you?
Anything is possible, but what's funny about a hole in the head?
God Is it possible?
I feel so foolish.
She must think I'm a twit.
Don't worry, when I first met you, I thought you were a twit, too.
Boy, this gal is a real kidder.
I mean, we're talking veritable goose.
We're having lunch together, so I can show Hester that I can give as good as I get.
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!
- What's up?
- Everything that's supposed to be.
Norm, I hear you spent the night in hospital.
- I'm OK, though.
- Good.
You can just take care of this at your leisure, I suppose.
$683?
- To have your head checked?
- Isn't that something?
They did a whole battery of tests on me.
- The important thing is I'm OK, isn't it?
- Well, no.
I mean, yes, but $683!
The cost of diagnostic testing has gone up dramatically.
I read recently it's running to billions every year.
Gee, I didn't know so many people got hit by corks.
- What did they do to you down there?
- Mostly routine stuff.
I did take care of one other little matter.
- Like what?
- I had a little mole removed.
- And you stuck me with it?
- Norm, where did you have a mole?
That must have been the one on your butt there, right?
Norm, I didn't know you were that vain.
Who's ever going to see your rear end?
You're just about to, wise guy.
I think you took advantage of me, Norm.
I figured you'd want to throw in the mole.
Makes a nice birthday gift, you know.
You want to be hard-nosed, I'll pay for it.
No, no.
Happy birthday.
- Thank you, it's just what I wanted.
- You're welcome.
I know it's a little early, but I wouldn't say no to a tummy tuck for Christmas.
I'll think about it.
Diane, look who's here.
If you have knees, prepare to slap them now.
Hello, dear.
- You're feeling better?
- Much better.
If Sam will let us steal you away, I have reservations for three for lunch.
Sounds good.
Hester, I've been thinking a lot about our little talk last night.
I hope you've been thinking long and hard.
I have.
Frasier, I came to a decision last night.
If we marry, I think we should commit mommy dearest to a rest home, making sure that beating and starving are the only forms of recreation.
Diane!
I beg your pardon?
In fact, I feel like slapping your face right now.
Take me out of here this moment.
It's a joke, come on.
I'm obviously kidding.
We won't put her in a rest home, we'll have her with us always.
We're going to have her stuffed.
And I'll even slit her throat in the process.
Thank you, Sam.
I've never encountered such hostility, personally or professionally.
I'm leaving.
No, just a minute, let's all take a beat.
The three of us are going into Sam's office and we'll work this thing through.
There's got to be a logical explanation.
And there'd better be, Diane.
It's all a joke.
Hester, you're with me on this, aren't you?
If terrible threats constitute jokes, no, I'm not with you on this.
OK, time to take stock here.
I'm not crazy, right, Diane?
Right you are.
A whole year of my life.
Hester, I was trying to joke with you like you were joking with me.
If you weren't joking, you threatened my life - I what?
- What?
She said that if I didn't stop seeing you, she'd shoot me.
This was obviously a mistake.
You know perfectly well you threatened my life!
I will not stay and be talked to like this.
Frasier, she is a rude, boorish, spiteful woman, who, for some reason I don't understand, resents me terribly.
- Mother, please.
- Liar, liar, pants on fire.
- Diane!
- I'm not lying.
She is.
If you love me, you'll stand up for me now when I need it.
Frasier, I'm asking you to leave with me now.
Frasier, this is the most important moment in our relationship.
If you abandon me now, that's it.
Mother, why did you threaten Diane?
- You believe her?
- Yes.
Oh, God!
I've lost you.
Frasier, I did say those terrible things, but, believe me, I had good reason.
OK, she said them, but she had good reasons.
- Not good enough!
- They'd better be good!
The best in the world.
I wanted to save you from ruining what could be a brilliant career.
I just can't stand the picture of you being married to a pseudo-intellectual barmaid.
No offence intended.
None taken.
Ç ne fit rien.
Mother, I can't believe this of you, a woman who has always been the most gentle, rational human being I've known.
My dear boy, you know I would never follow through on my threat to kill her.
As I was pricing revolvers this morning, I realised how irrational my feelings were.
But don't you understand?
I'd rather see you shovelling sherbet at Howard Johnson's in a silly hat and an apron than make a bad marriage.
Mother, you don't understand.
We're not going to have a bad marriage.
And I'm not going to shovel sherbet.
But I would be happy doing it if Diane were at my side.
Oh, Frasier, I never realised how much this woman meant to you.
Of course, I don't really understand why.
I never understood your spider collection either, but I grew to accept that.
Diane, she's reaching out.
Please.
Doctor Crane, I'm sorry if I made a bad first impression, but I think, no, I know, it was a wrong impression.
I may be a diamond in the rough now, but I'm a dreamer, and I have a habit of making dreams come true.
When and if I marry Frasier Crane, I will be the kind of wife and family you'll be proud to know and claim.
People will get tired hearing you boast about your daughter-in-law.
Diane, I see I've handled this so badly.
Well, yes I suppose I've made a few mistakes myself.
- Let's go out and come in again.
- I'd love to.
This is the most incredible moment of my entire day.
I'm going to take you two future best pals out to the finest lunch in town.
- Sounds good - OK.
I need a glass of water.
You two, go ahead, I'll catch up with you.
That's OK.
It's free of charge.
I understand you used to date that woman.
I want to know how much you'd charge to start things up again.
- You don't have enough money.
- How would you know?
There isn't enough money.
- I know what you mean.
- I don't think you do.
- I think I do.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.
- Oh, no.

{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
AN AMERICAN FAMILY - Could I have some suds, Coach?
- Yeah.
Normie, how's it going?
You got Vera pregnant yet?
Not yet.
What's up?
It's been a few months.
I'm a little disappointed.
I'm doing my darnedest.
- Anything to get Vera off my back.
- Your back?
I think I see a little problem with your technique.
Coach, can I have a pencil and a large piece of paper?
Anyone see Orosco hit a homer last night?
- What a fluke.
A relief pitcher.
- Unbelievable.
- Sammy, what kind of hitter were you?
- I remember hitting 211 one year.
In your dreams.
One Scotch rocks, please.
- I don't think you ever hit over 150.
- Wait, I got 20 bucks says he did.
- You're on, sucker.
- Kiss that Andrew Jackson goodbye.
It's beyond me why you insist on making a contest out of the most meaningless issues.
No, on the contrary, Diane.
We also address ourselves to some of the most vital issues of our times.
For instance, if south-east Asia were to be obliterated by a nuclear attack, Norm would have to push a peanut up Boylston Street with his nose.
But only as far as the corner.
Come on, peace.
Hi, is this Pequod?
This is Sam Malone.
I'd like a reservation for two in one of your cosier rooms for the weekend.
That's great.
I'll see you Friday night, late.
- I heard you mention the Pequod.
- Yeah, that's right.
That wouldn't be that charming little inn that you and I went to last fall?
I'm sorry.
I didn't think.
- This is gonna bother you, isn't it?
- Of course not.
What you do now is your own concern.
Take a different woman every night.
Actually, it's easier to have them meet me there.
It's gonna bug you, me going there with somebody else, isn't it?
Not at all.
This is bugging the hell out of you.
I tell you what, I'll go someplace else.
I understand.
Don't be ridiculous.
It doesn't bug me, as you so eloquently put it.
Yeah?
Would you take Frasier there?
In fact, Frasier and I have been to several places you and I frequented.
It's refreshing to go out with someone who doesn't slide across museum floors in their socks.
Those paintings look a lot better if you go by fast.
Anyway, I'll make sure they don't put me in the same room at the Pequod.
I could care less.
Room number 12.
That was a great room, 12.
Remember when that nor'easter blew through, and we had to stay inside by that big old fireplace?
Yeah.
We listened to the wind lashing against the panes, the rain on the roof.
- Huddled under that big comforter.
- I never felt safer.
Me neither.
- You weren't there, Coach.
- I thought you meant now.
Sam, please.
Go, have a good time.
- Just don't do anything I wouldn't do.
- I'm afraid I've lost that list.
I remember you.
You're that blonde waitress.
And you're Carla's incredibly loathsome ex-husband.
So we both stuck in each other's minds.
Sit down.
You want anything?
- Thanks.
I'll have a Coke.
- Be sophisticated.
We're in a bar.
Coca Cola.
No, no.
Order some kind of drink.
I'd like something in a coconut.
You're something in a coconut.
Two Scotches.
Nick, this is a surprise.
How you doing, Sam?
You dumped Carla by now?
We're no longer going together, but Carla dumped me.
She dumped you?
Sam, you boggle me.
Wait a second.
I did dump that blonde waitress there.
Nick!
- What the hell do you want?
- Hey!
- Is that the kind of hello I deserve?
- No, bend over and I'll give it to you.
I gotta talk to you.
I would have come by the house, but I didn't want Loretta to see my humble beginnings.
I need a favour.
Unless it's setting your eyebrows on fire, forget it.
- I used to drive you crazy.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah I came because I want a kid.
Shouldn't you be baking your biscuits in blondie's oven now?
I'm talking about one of ours, the fruit of my loins.
Would you like to use my office, for a little privacy?
- No.
- Please.
- What's this about?
- As you know, I'm now married to the goddess - compared to you - Loretta.
She can't have kids and it's breaking her heart.
I don't want anybody thinking it's my fault so I figured I'd take one of our old ones.
You want me to give you and that twinkie one of my children?
- Product of my seed.
- Please, please.
- This is outrageous, even for you.
- What's the big deal?
You got five.
Carla, don't let this recidivist strong-arm you.
There is no bond greater than that of mother and child.
He's talking of your babies.
The issue of your womb.
Would anyone mind if I went into my office?
Carla, see reason.
Take out an ad in the paper.
You never know what the kid'll look like, but I can't believe you'd be fussy.
What is this, "Days of Our Lives"?
I want my own, not somebody else's.
Mind your own businesses.
I didn't think you'd be cold-hearted, but as you are, I have to do what I'm trying to avoid at all costs.
- Breathe through your nose?
- No.
I'm taking you to court.
- You can't do that.
- No?
My attorney assures me that I got a very good case.
In fact, he thinks I can get all five kids and you as a maid.
I'm letting you off easy.
Tom, you're a lawyer.
Can he do this?
Family law is not my specialty.
However Wait, hold on there, Oliver Wendell Holmes.
What is your specialty, blowing the bar exam?
I'm gonna pass it this time.
Don't you worry about it.
I won't.
You've taken it in every state in New England.
This is a man who thinks affidavit's a Jewish wine.
If he knows anything, he knows more than you.
- Thanks.
- Go on, Tom.
We can't wait.
There's a chance he could get custody, if he can prove you're an unfit mother.
Thank you, Counsellor.
And who do you think they're gonna pick?
Me, a sincere, hard-working family man?
Or you, a hard-up waitress, who leaves her kids every night to come to a sleazy bar?
- Watch it.
- Yeah, she's off Thursday nights.
I can also prove that you consort with men of questionable character.
What do you mean?
You got the morals of a sewer rat.
Not to worry.
If you knew your law, you'd know a thing in the Bill of Rights called the double standard.
Watch the bureaucrats take that away from us, too.
You're bluffing.
Court costs money, you know.
Unless TV repair has increased dramatically, you make diddle.
Every time you open your mouth, you show your ignorance.
The Tortelli Television Hospital has just come off a record-breaking quarter.
I'll tell you, I got ten men working under me, and two of them is American.
Even if I gave you those kids, they wouldn't want to go with you.
The young ones don't know who you are, the old ones hate your guts.
I don't believe this.
Anthony loves me.
He's the oldest.
He remembers you walking out.
He thinks you're a creep.
- He thinks I'm cool.
- Calls you scuzball.
- He didn't learn that from me.
- Didn't learn anything from you!
The nuclear testing range next door's complaining.
Nick, we're gonna be late for that Menudo concert.
Oh, yeah, Menudo.
I won the tickets on the radio.
What is it, anyway?
Go to your concert.
You ain't getting no kid of mine.
I know how to cut this short.
- I wanna talk to you alone.
- No.
Forget about it.
I got nothing I wanna talk to you about alone.
Just a little chat.
Between you and I. Private matters.
Well OK.
Sam, can we use your office?
Why?
What secrets could you possibly have left?
No, don't answer that.
Use my office.
- Carla looked nervous going in there.
- Who wouldn't be?
Whenever Nick gets a woman alone, he wraps them round his little finger.
Well, Carla's a pretty tough little nut.
It'll take more than Nick can muster to break the bond between a mother and her first-born offspring.
Mommy!
The kid is ours!
- Daddy!
- We're a family now.
- Let's stuff our faces till we get sick.
- Sounds good.
What are you all looking at?
Never seen a jellyfish before?
Normie, I hate to be the one to tell you this.
But Sam's batting average never went past 149.
- There's the stat book.
- 149.
That's right.
I don't wanna be the kind of guy who rubs it in, so just let me say I have a little bad news for you.
I bet the Coach that if you won you'd be obnoxious, so I come out even.
Troops, I'm back!
What's so funny?
Normie just lost a bundle to Cliffie on a bet.
But the Coach just lost a bundle to me.
But the funniest thing is, it's based on the fact that you couldn't hit a baseball to save your life!
- Know what's even funnier than that?
- What?
Cliffie spent 30 bucks on a book to win a 20 dollar bet.
Yeah?
Well, you lent me the money.
You know I'll never pay it back.
You know, the way you revel in each other's defeats is totally reprehensible.
Are you ever as pleased with each other's good fortune?
Who's had any?
Boy, I tell you, it's good to be home.
- How was the Pequod, Sam?
- Pequod?
Was it everything you remembered it to be?
Diane, why torment yourself?
- So you really went?
- Of course.
Did you enjoy the fruit basket Frasier and I sent to your room?
- Fruit basket?
- Yes, the fruit basket.
- The fruit basket?
- The fruit basket.
Yeah, OK, we loved the fruit basket.
- We didn't send a fruit basket.
- Damn!
I knew it.
Your heart wouldn't let you go to that place with another woman.
I find that very sweet.
- She won that one, didn't she?
- Not necessarily.
Hey, everybody.
- Hi, Carla.
- Isn't it a great day?
You know, as I got up this morning, and I was feeding my four - count them - four kids, I said to myself, "Carla, you are so lucky.
"Think of all those poor human beings who have five or more kids.
"Instead of just four like me.
" You don't even miss this kid at all?
I can't even remember his name.
- Anthony.
- My baby!
The one time I remember something!
If you felt this way, why on earth did you give that child away?
Because I could never say no to that man.
I never even wanted to go out with him in the first place.
He won me over.
I didn't wanna go to bed with him.
He won me over.
I didn't wanna marry him.
I didn't wanna have five kids.
Our whole history is me saying no and him winning me over.
Like the other day in there?
He held my hand.
And he got real close to me, and then he batted those eyelashes at me.
He said, "Carla, you know why I want that kid?
"Cos he is a part of you.
He's the only part of you I have.
" - Nick said that?
- Let's not even discuss it.
It's over, the kid is his.
He's coming by to have me sign the papers.
If you don't wanna sign, don't sign.
Stand up to the guy.
I'll resist.
But if I'm alone with him for a second, I'll melt.
Then, as a simple solution, we shan't let you alone with him.
Right, everyone?
We shan't!
Let's get this signed and over with!
Carla, don't you have something you wanna tell Nick?
Yeah.
Yes, there is.
I am not signing that paper.
You can't have Anthony.
I don't care what you say.
I don't care what the courts say.
I want my kid back.
Yes!
You said Carla didn't give a hoot for the kids.
There's a new development.
- I can't do this.
- What?
What do you have to do?
I just realised that Carla and I are both women.
And I can't do this to her.
I can't be a party to child stealing.
Are you crazy?
The kid's as much mine as hers.
I'm sorry.
I refuse.
I've got to put my foot down about something.
And when I make up my mind, that's my final decision.
While you're thinking about it, why don't we go into Sam's office and have a private talk?
I don't think that's going to work this time.
- Please?
- Well OK.
- But it's a waste of time.
- We'll be right back.
You can keep talking until you're blue in the face, but it's not gonna change my mind, you're not gonna Carla, sign the paper.
What is this?
Even a shot of vitamin Sammy doesn't work that fast.
- Sign the paper.
- I won't.
- Sign it!
- Hang tough, Carla.
How about you and I go into Sam's office and have a private talk?
- Don't do it, Carla.
- Stay out here with us.
No, I have to go in there with him.
If I can stand up to him this one time, I can break his spell.
- And I think I can do it.
- You gotta know you can do it.
I think I can do it.
OK, Carla's in there facing the greatest crisis of her life.
I want everybody to be quiet for a moment, close your eyes and send her your most positive mental energy.
- Good idea.
- Guess it can't hurt.
Come on, everyone.
This is important.
One two three.
Norman!
Come on, Carla, don't be so cold.
I'm a lonely guy.
You're not lonely.
You're disgusting.
Fine, just hear me out on this.
Anthony is the product of our love.
None of that, either.
I've had enough of your sweet talk.
- I don't wanna hear that stuff.
- All right.
Fine.
- No more sweet talk, no more touching.
- Right.
How about I just Stop it, Nick.
Don't give me the look.
No, not the look!
Call me - irresponsible - The song!
- The look and the song!
- Call me unreliable I'll get the pen.
- Wait a minute, do that again.
- Can't get enough of it?
Nothing.
- Nothing?
- Zero!
You should have stopped at your dumb look.
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about this!
I'm impressed.
I didn't think you had it in you.
This is the first time you stood up to me.
You resisted my charms.
You win.
Wait a minute, there.
I know better than that.
Your heart wasn't in it.
You know how much that kid meant to me.
What are you talking about?
I did my best.
Maybe I don't have it any more.
You have more of it now than you ever did.
- You just went easy on me.
- I busted a gut!
Nick.
You went easy on me, didn't you?
Maybe I did.
Maybe I didn't.
Well, if you did, thanks.
And if you didn't Take care.
Hey, everybody!
I got my kid back!
Come on, Loretta.
Congratulations, Carla.
What's your secret?
- She knows when to shut up.
- When?
Now.
I hope today has been a good lesson for you.
I hope it has diffused the notion that you have some magic power to make women bend to your will.
Mr Tortelli, I find you beneath contempt.
Before you're so hard on me, I'd like to tell you something about myself.
What?
It's confidential.
What?
I can't hear what you're saying.
All I can feel is your warm, that is to say, your hot, breath on my English
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
DIANE'S ALLERG Y I'm looking for Sam Malone, the ex-Red Sox player.
Over there behind the bar.
- Boy, has he gotten old.
- No, son, I'm Sam Malone.
I know.
Your mother knows you hang around in bars?
My brother, Doug, is the biggest Red Sox fan ever.
He's in hospital having his tonsils out.
It would mean a lot if he could have an autograph.
- Sure thing.
- Here you go.
Not yours.
I figured you'd know where to find Carl Yastrzemski.
No, but I'll start you on your way.
Sam, hold it.
Just kidding.
Here's your ball.
I'm sorry.
We don't keep in touch.
Doug will be disappointed.
I don't know what to do.
Could you sign it?
It's almost as good.
You sure your brother won't mind?
Yeah.
He doesn't know what Yastrzemski's handwriting looks like.
Good point.
OK, cut the crap.
Today's my birthday.
You all know that.
If you're planning a party for me, and you better be, let's get the show on the road.
If that's not a cue for merriment, what is?
Just a small token of my appreciation.
A very small token.
Good things come in small packages.
Little things come in small packages.
Perfume.
No, toilet water.
Gag gift, I went for it.
OK.
All right, Carla.
- Maybe this will make it up to you.
- Now, this is more like it.
All right.
A jelly bean.
Thank you, Norm.
Another gag gift.
You guys are too much.
And garlic flavoured.
Nice touch, Norm.
All right.
Come on, stop.
You know how these clowns have to get their gags in.
We saved the best for last.
This is from me and from Coach.
Silverware.
- Lone Ranger?
- You wear it to ride on Silver.
Don't you get it, Carla?
You wear it to ride on Silver.
- Silverware.
- Hilarious.
Thanks a bunch, guys.
Don't thank us, it's the thought.
Can we throw a party or what?
- There he is.
- Can't we put this off till tomorrow?
It's such a lovely evening.
Let's not despoil it.
You only inflame violent emotional confrontations by putting them off.
Your intelligence inflames me.
Really?
Well, e = mc squared.
Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny.
Baby!
How about a couple of brandies?
Where were you?
You missed Carla's party.
We discovered this French-Japanese restaurant.
Very chic, dark, romantic.
Be careful about unlighted joints.
You don't know what grubby food they'll slip you.
Not Chez Fujimoto.
Sam, Frasier and I have something important to tell you.
Sam, this may be rough going.
Despite your vehement protests to the contrary, and without disparaging your sincerity, we believe you're suffering some emotional residue from your relationship with Diane.
I'm sorry, Frasier, I must have dozed off for a paragraph or two.
What was he saying?
We came to an important decision tonight.
Sam, brace yourself.
Diane and I are going to cohabitate.
Right here in the bar?
I guess it's cheaper than a piano player.
This is predictable.
Making jokes to mask the pain.
I don't understand.
I'm moving into Frasier's fashionable townhouse.
Where's Frasier moving to?
You're being deliberately opaque Frasier, he's making a joke.
Shoot.
You two will be shacked up together?
Yes, I decided it was time.
What spoiled an evening with Diane was having to say good night.
Really?
That was one of my highlights.
We know how much this hurts you, but your defensiveness is annoying.
I don't know what you expected me to do when you told me, but this doesn't bother me.
I am very happy for you kids.
Thank you, Sam.
We couldn't be happier.
The only thing standing in the way of a total commitment is Pavlov's response.
You see, that's my little joke, Sam.
Pavlov is my dog, you see, and I couldn't resist the witticism.
- Let me explain.
Pavlov - I know all about Pavlov.
Drooling at the sound of a dinner bell.
I've done that before, but I never knew what to call it.
I had a puppy once.
My ex-wife took her.
Little bitch.
About this high.
Frasier, we left Carla's present in the car.
I'll get it.
I hope I remember where I parked.
I'm inebriated with joy over this situation.
Or else the sake made me crocky.
Nobody told me he was funny.
Now you know why.
It's pretty exciting news.
- Yes, we felt it was time.
- I wish you all the luck in the world.
Because we'll need it?
You're a pair made in heaven.
I don't care what the sceptics say, I say the two of you will last Let's see, what time is it now?
Sam, you're hurting now, aren't you?
Admit it.
It's not surprising that you're bitter.
I never took this step with you, but what Frasier and I have together is more substantial.
What you and I had was exciting, tempestuous at times, but there was no future in it.
You've got to be careful about that excitement stuff.
Too much of that and soon you're starting to expect life to be enjoyable.
Then one day you wake up and all those years of pleasure have gone by and what have you got to show for it?
Happiness.
How true.
Here it is.
Where's our birthday girl?
In the back.
She'll be out in a minute.
Sam, would you call her?
I've lots to do.
I want to start moving my clothes in.
Do you have enough closet space?
Loads.
Don't worry about that.
Frasier and Diane here have a gift for you.
- Be still, my heart.
- Many happy returns, Carla.
- Beautiful wrapping.
- Yes, Coach, exquisite wrapping.
Now, let's get to the joke.
- Diane, these are beautiful.
- Frasier picked them out.
Thank you.
- How about vino to break them in?
- Yeah, I want to make a toast.
I want to toast the two people who had enough class to get me a real gift.
To Diane and Frasier.
No matter how many times I give fine-dribble crystal, I never tire of it.
So how's it going, Carla?
Fine.
But don't think I don't appreciate busy guys like you caring enough to ask.
She's still sore about the gag gifts.
She's more than sore.
She's hurt, offended and resentful.
If she were wearing dirty bunny slippers, she could be Vera.
It's our fault.
We could have got her something nice.
It's not too late.
We can still give her a surprise.
Just buy her a real gift.
Well, I'm a knowledgeable shopper.
I'll take charge of Operation Make-Good.
We sure we want Cliff to handle this?
He's likely to buy something tasteless.
Yeah, but none of us will know the difference.
Cliffie, you're our man.
Afternoon, everyone.
Isn't it a beautiful day?
- How are the new living arrangements?
- Like a charm.
I don't know why we didn't do it from the start.
- Is that right?
- I couldn't be happier, absolutely.
- Diane - Yeah, I know, I'm sorry.
You'll have to excuse that.
I have some some kind of an itch, sort of in the back of my throat.
Have you ever had one of those?
Boy, it's almost as if it's inside my ear, but not there either.
You know?
That must be maddening.
Let me get you the ice pick.
I was sneezing all morning.
At least that's stopped.
- I wonder what causes it.
- That adorable puppy of Frasier's.
- Little Pavlov?
- She's very sweet, but I'm a cat person.
I obviously have some kind of an allergy to dogs.
- Are you sure it's the dog?
- What else could it be?
You've been around that dog before.
You must have.
Moving in with Frasier is a big commitment.
I wonder if this whole so-called allergy thing might not be psychosomatic.
Sam, I'm very impressed.
That's a complex psychological concept coming from a man who has to write L and R on the bottom of his shoes.
- Does that mean you agree with me?
- Don't be ridiculous.
I just had this thought.
Could it be that you still love somebody from your past?
- You?
- Well, not necessarily.
It could have been Sumner or anybody, but isn't it interesting that I spring to mind?
No.
You automatically spring to mind whenever I hear something stupid.
- Hello, my dearest darling.
- Frasier!
Gesundheit.
I've reconsidered.
I was unyielding this morning.
I realise your happiness comes first.
I must give up Pavlov.
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.
I can't just put the little tyke out on the streets.
I've must find the best home.
That's a lengthy process.
- I'll take her.
- Frasier, I realise that this may If the dog's the only thing standing between you, then if I take her away, everything will be fine for Diane, right?
I love dogs.
I'll give her a great home.
I will.
There we are, then.
Done, Sam, done and by golly, done.
She's yours.
Good.
That should clear just about everything up.
I should say so.
We're mighty grateful too.
Aren't we?
Yes.
In fact, do you want to hear something funny?
Just knowing that the dog is going, I'm already feeling better.
No more allergies.
Gesundheit.
- Hello, Sam.
- Frasier, what can I get you?
I've got a heavy patient load.
Make it a triple stinger and a beer chaser.
No, let me have a club soda.
Sam, listen.
Fill me in.
I'm hungry for news of little Pavlov.
Pavlov?
You must mean little Diane.
- I beg your pardon?
- I renamed the puppy Diane.
I figured you wouldn't mind.
It's my puppy now.
I tell you, it's so wonderful.
Any trouble, I swat her on the rear end and say, "Shut up, Diane.
" And she does.
It's heaven.
Changing the dog's name hurts me a little.
Don't you think two Dianes will be confusing?
Maybe.
We'll just have to call your girlfriend Pavlov.
How are Pavlov's allergies now that I got Diane?
These things don't clear up overnight.
The latest symptom is a recurring voice change.
- A what?
- You'll have to hear it.
I don't think words can do it justice.
Where's Carla?
I did it.
I went out.
I got her a great birthday present.
You mean it's Carla's birthday already again?
The older you get, time goes No.
This is a real gift to make up for those gag gifts we got.
A real gift which better be good.
Hi, sweetheart.
Hey, Carla.
Many happy returns.
No thanks.
No more hilarious gifts, OK?
My sides are still sore from last week.
- Carla, it's a very nice gift.
- Yeah?
What does it do?
Explode, stink, or make disgusting sounds?
No, this is the real gift, Carla, which better be good.
This is beautiful.
I love this.
It's perfect.
This makes up for everything, I think.
It's not easy for me to say thanks, but thanks, guys.
Way to go, Cliff!
You haven't heard the best part though.
The longer you wear it, body heat makes the words, "I am horny as a hoot owl" appear right on the back.
Get him out of here.
- See you tomorrow, gang.
- Good night, Cliff.
Excuse me, Sam.
Something's been troubling me.
I gave you the wrong impression that Diane and I are unhappy.
- No.
- We're going through an adjustment.
In fact, today I think she's shown some improvement.
- Hello, everyone.
Hello, sweetheart.
- Hello, Diane.
- You're going to say gesundheit?
- We've moved past gesundheit.
We're now on our way to "stuff a sock in it".
I'm sorry.
You know I was joking.
How come you still have allergies if I've got Diane?
- Diane?
- That's what he calls Pavlov.
Don't ask.
Diane, are you feeling any better?
There are obviously still traces of Pavlov in the apartment, which I cannot remove.
She's tried.
I've had it fumigated, I've had all the furniture reupholstered, I've had the wallpaper steamed off.
Looks darned good, incidentally.
We discovered natural brick on one wall.
The place needed redecorating.
How would you feel about linoleum in the living room?
- What?
- A lot of people have done it.
- I'm almost sure I've seen pictures - That's it!
I can't take it any more!
Denial and repression.
I devoted myself professionally to fighting these and now I'm wading in them upstream.
OK, keep the carpet!
We're both know allergic reactions are psychosomatic.
There's a thought.
Maybe on some subconscious level, you don't want to be living with me.
Frasier, it's the dog.
I keep telling you.
It's the dog!
The voice.
Diane, the damn dog is gone.
She's halfway across the city!
I don't want to put you through all this.
Frasier, we've made a commitment here.
You're not ready yet for this kind of commitment.
Perhaps some day you will be.
We'll wait and see.
No, I'm going to make this work.
Diane, please, don't hold on to this for me.
I love you.
But I think your health is more important.
Maybe you're right.
I'm sure I'm right.
Now, listen.
Go and gargle and spray your throat.
Use your inhaler, take your antihistamine and put your nose drops in.
Use whatever else you find in that pharmacy you call a purse.
Well, Sam, aren't you going to gloat?
I like to think I'm above that, Diane.
Am I nuts, or is that kind of sexy?
Frasier, that's a tough break.
Damn it.
I thought we were going to make it work in a big way.
I bet you do and I bet you do it pretty soon.
Will you excuse me?
- The problem is now I'm entirely alone.
- Yeah, that's tough.
I want my doggy back!
Frasier, I've grown accustomed to the old girl.
My emotional need for her is stronger than yours.
- She's mine.
- But I love her.
- Find another one.
- I don't want to talk about this.
Nothing can make me change my mind.
She's mine.
You were just a port in the storm.
I want her and I'll have her.
Don't stand in my way or you'll suffer my wrath.
Do I make myself clear?
Frasier, this is so exciting.
You are the only man to proclaim his feelings for me with such eloquence.
What we were talking about She knows what and who we were talking about.
She's a clever girl and a beautiful one.
Frasier, do you know that there's a Kurosawa film festival at Cambridge?
I'm not really in the mood to go Kurosawa, you say?
Kurosawa and I'm really in the mood.
I could see his films again and again Sam, could I have the afternoon off, please?
You wouldn't want to stand between me and Diane and "The Seven Samurai"?
No.
I hope all nine of you have a wonderful time.
Sammy, Frasier walks out of here with Diane and you get to go home to a dog.
Yeah, somebody up there likes me.
English
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
WHODUNIT OK, folks.
Just to help you pass time while you're waiting for a table upstairs, I will show you a trick that leaves people with their mouths wide open.
I'm going to guess your age by asking three simple questions.
OK?
- Sounds like fun.
- Good.
OK, first question.
What year were you born?
- You're kidding?
- Bare with me, will you?
OK, second question.
How much do you weigh?
About 185 pounds.
OK, third and last question.
What do you do for a living?
I'm a carpet salesman.
OK, I should have an answer for you right after dinner.
- After dinner?
- Yeah, I forgot to carry a number.
Four, six and seven - Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!
- What would you like?
- Got anything pale and cold?
Yeah, but it's Diane's day off.
I'll have a beer then, I guess.
You look a little glum, buddy.
Do you have a problem?
My new boss just chewed me out.
He says I lack enthusiasm.
Well, is that true?
I don't know.
I guess.
Who cares?
Well, here it is, Dr Ludlow.
It was Diane's idea to expose you to Boston's seamy underbelly.
Frasier, Dr Ludlow will enjoy a quaint little Boston pub.
I wonder who the guy is with them.
A talent scout for a geek show.
I wish that I'd worn a heavier overcoat.
- I had no idea it would be so chilly.
- I apologise.
You're apologising for the weather?
Yes, and the fact that I've had this toasty garment.
- Why don't you wear it?
- We're not exactly the same size.
- I'm sorry.
- Stop apologising.
That's all right.
I don't mind.
- Frasier - I'm sorry.
I turn to jelly in the presence of my mentor, Dr Ludlow.
This attitude was all right when you were in my programme, but we are peers now.
Did you hear that, Diane?
Peers.
Ludlow, get us some brandies!
No, I'm just kidding.
I'll get them.
- Diane, could you give me a hand?
- Certainly.
Excuse me.
- Did you notice?
- Of course.
- What are we going to do about it?
- Ignore it.
Ignore it?
That's like telling me to ignore your fly being open.
Yes, very good point.
It isn't, is it?
What's the problem here?
My colleague has dropped a crumb during dinner and it has become encrusted on his tie.
So?
You could take Norm's tie, put it in a kettle and make soup.
Incidentally, the tie was invented in ancient times to be used as a bib.
- You know, to wipe your chin.
- They're thinking of changing that?
Why not just tell the guy?
Why didn't we come to Sam in the first place?
You don't say "there's a spot" to a man of the stature of Dr Bennett Ludlow.
The Bennett Ludlow?
- You've heard of him, Coach?
- No.
He's one of the giants of psychiatry.
Author, innovator, educator, and my idol and inspiration.
Lean over and pretend to admire his tie tack, and just nibble the morsel off real quick.
- Who's the wiser?
- Sam is right.
We have to tell him.
Of course you're right.
May we have three brandies?
I should tell him.
I suggested beef Wellington.
Beef Wellington, you say?
Where's that tie?
Show me.
I'll just have to tell him in a subtle way that will preserve his dignity.
Hey, pigpen!
What's that thing?
Are you trying to catch pigeons?
Thank you.
Don't mention it.
I like a man who wears his dinner with pride.
Here.
Sir, it may cause you some personal embarrassment, but you have a spot in my heart.
- Always will.
- Thank you, Frasier.
If you'll excuse me, I've got a telephone call to make.
Believe me, I am not the sort of man who approaches young ladies and tries to be more familiar by using some smooth line.
Your secret is safe with me.
Pardon me for saying this, but something about you is so strikingly attractive.
While you're stare at my zoomers, let's see if we can figure it out.
- How can I get your telephone number?
- A phone book.
Would you tell me your name or shall I check under "Hot Babe"?
The name is Carla Tortelli and I'm starting to like you.
- Say, Norm?
- Yes, Cliff?
You seem to have a spot on your tie.
So I do, so I do.
Thank you for pointing that out.
If more people were as conscientious, we could wipe out social embarrassment.
Don't thank me, Norm.
Periodic tie checks are the duty of every American citizen.
- Did he look at his tie?
- No.
So much for subtlety.
All right.
You start a fire for diversion.
I'll hose him down.
- Boy, am I exhausted.
- Not much sleep?
No, I slept like a baby.
It's just that I dreamed I had insomnia all night.
Someday that man's head will open up and a prize will pop out.
- Hi, everybody.
- Hey, Carla.
- I got some flowers here.
- For me?
Very cute, Carla.
You've had flowers every day for two weeks.
Yeah, I guess I ought to be feeling guilty.
I'm getting all these flowers and there are bees going hungry.
We're kind of curious here.
Who's your secret admirer?
- It's none of your damn business.
- Thank you, Carla.
- What did she say?
- None of your damn business.
Well, excuse me for living.
What if I said that when you asked me how to throw a knuckleball?
- You did.
- So we're even.
Frasier, you're early.
- Is something wrong?
- Of course something's wrong.
Dr Ludlow cancelled on us again.
Surprise, surprise.
- What excuse did he give this time?
- Something came up.
Something's been coming up for the last two months.
Well, maybe we have to admit he doesn't want to see us socially.
I guess we've been trying too hard.
Sam, can I get a beer, please?
Especially the first night when we made such buffoons of ourselves.
- We, Frasier?
- All right, you.
- Me?
- Yes!
The way you fawned over him was criminal.
If you had taken off your clothes, it would have been a refreshing note of subtlety.
No wonder he's shunning us.
Frasier, you were so obsequious, if he had asked you to cluck and lay an egg, you would have asked, " What colour"?
Well, he didn't ask me to, so it's a moot point at best.
I'm sorry.
Diane, I need tonight off.
Could you switch with me?
- Well - Why not?
- There's nothing going on in our lives.
- Carla, you're in luck again.
It seems when you want to trade nights, my plans get cancelled.
Yeah, go figure.
Hey, Diane.
You know, I've been thinking Have you?
The odds makers take a beating again.
Listen, is it possible this Ludlow fellow hasn't been seeing you two because he's been spending all his time with Carla?
Either that or he had to finish his paper route on Mars.
Sorry you felt the sting of my wit, but it's ludicrous.
Now wait a minute.
There are two mysteries going on here.
Carla's been seeing this very classy guy, and your pal's been avoiding you like the plague.
Of course, that's the lesser of the two mysteries.
You're talking about one of the most accomplished men of letters, dating a common barmaid.
- So are you.
- She wasn't when I met her.
That's right.
She was a lunatic.
No, it's true, Coach.
Many scientists believe that the little finger, that's the pinkie, will, like the tail, disappear cos it serves no useful purpose.
People couldn't go swimming without their little finger.
Why is that, Coach?
When you come out of the water, you can't do this.
I stand corrected.
Sam, may I speak to you for a moment?
OK, a cute lunatic.
All right?
Frasier is in a very fragile state of mind.
Your asinine theories, while suitable fodder for inane bar conversation, do nothing to ease his pique.
Wait a minute.
The one word I understood, I don't exactly care for.
- My theory's not asinine.
- You're right.
It's a lot worse.
Think of the two of them together.
Bennett Ludlow and Carla?
It's hair-brained.
Just imagine it!
Well, there it is now.
- No, I guess I haven't.
- Diane, what's Benny here may look like a stiff, but he's out for a good time.
I was drawn to Carla from the start.
There's something sensual and earthy about her.
Didn't any of you suspect?
No, you'd have to be a real brain to figure this out, don't you think, Frasier?
How come you kept it such a secret?
That's the way me and Big Ben wanted it.
Our backgrounds are a little different, which is a slight problem.
If word gets around your guy tucks his T-shirt in his undershorts, your reputation is shot to hell.
And I had similar reasons to be discrete.
Yeah, well.
The cat's out of the bag now.
Excuse me, I have to see my customers.
This calls for somebody to buy a round!
- Well, I'll do that!
- You beat me to it.
I'll get the next one.
Diane, excuse me.
Now that I'm running in egghead circles, we're going to bump into each other at parties.
You with your boyfriend and me with mine His hero.
OK, I think I've come to terms with this.
Dr Ludlow, you came here on vacation.
You've had your walk on the wild side.
You can return to your proper sphere, refreshed and a better man.
Frankly, it's a bit more complicated than that.
I'm going to take a short trip, and when I come back I'm going to ask Ms Tortelli to marry me.
How wonderful.
- Sam, where is she?
- I don't know.
She's never late.
- Did Carla call?
- Yeah.
- What did she say?
- None of your damn business.
How's your knuckleball?
Come on, we've been over this.
Give me a break, will you?
Dr Ludlow?
We're happy that Carla's getting the first break of her life.
All this talk about romance gives me a warm spot right here.
Or was it that meal I had at the Hungry Heifer?
Yes.
I went back for their special chicken dinner.
- What was it?
- A bowl of pellets and a handful of grain.
Well, here she is.
What's going on?
Dr Ludlow has something he wants to talk to you about.
I had not expected there to be a spectators.
Perhaps you'd like to step over here?
Benny, is this what I think it is?
Yes, Carla.
I want you to marry me.
- Wow, what a day!
- Well, will you?
- I guess I'd be crazy to say no.
- Champagne, please, for everybody!
All right.
Way to go, Doc.
Thank you.
It happened right here.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Champagne for everybody.
I couldn't help noticing you're not exactly leaping for joy.
Bennett Ludlow is a wonderful catch.
Well there's some things he doesn't know about me.
A little mystery is good for a marriage.
What haven't you told him?
I haven't been completely honest about my kids.
What haven't you told him about them?
That they live.
He doesn't know you have children?
Carla, I think you'd better tell him.
He's going to wonder who those little people are.
I was hoping he'd be too polite to ask.
I didn't want to scare him off.
It's only fair that you tell him you have five children.
- Six.
- OK, six.
But don't wait I thought it was five.
It was.
I just came from the doctor.
When you were in high school and you took Hygiene did you cut the how-not-to lecture?
I had to.
I was pregnant.
I'm the most fertile woman living.
There's only one foolproof method of birth control, and it makes me sick.
- What's that?
- Saying no.
- Carla, are you all right?
- I'll just go celebrate.
We're like a big family.
You know what they say, more to love.
If you want to be in a big fa - Beat it.
- Bye.
My proposal was not met with the enthusiasm I expected, and it suddenly occurred to me that I never heard the word "yes".
I know.
I got to tell you some things.
Would you sit down for a minute?
- This sounds serious.
- It is.
Have you seen "The Brady Bunch"?
Yes, I think so.
Well, picture them with knives.
I don't understand.
I have five kids.
- Five?
- Well, five and counting.
You're going to be a daddy.
This is quite a day.
You have my permission to withdraw your proposal.
Do you want me to withdraw my proposal?
I want you to do what you want to do.
I want you to marry me.
You're kidding.
What class!
I still haven't heard the word "yes".
I know.
Why do you think that is?
I think that if you look into your feelings, you'll know.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, I think I do.
- I'm in love with someone else.
- Who is it, Carla?
I don't know his name.
I've never even met him.
But I've had this picture of him in my mind for what seems like forever.
But he is going to walk into this bar one night.
Well, not walk, more like swagger.
You know, confident, but not cocky.
He's OK-looking, but he's no pretty-boy.
He's a swell dresser.
He's got on this burgundy leather jacket.
He's got cherry LifeSavers in one pocket and a pack of Camels in the other.
He's trying to quit them both, but he can't.
His nose is broken in all the right places.
And he's got this scar that he won't talk about.
He cracks his knuckles all the time.
But what are you going to do?
Doesn't talk much.
Doesn't have to.
He falls for me.
Hard.
I hurt him a few times.
He gets over it.
We get married.
So, you see, it'd be a little messy if I was already married when he got here.
You know, Carla, I sort of have a dream girl myself.
Tell me about her.
Well, she's a spunky, hearty, curly-haired little spitfire who doesn't know what's really good for her.
- I hope you find her someday.
- Me too.
I intend to take care of that child financially.
You bet your buns you will, Benny baby.
- Are you OK?
- Would you knock it off?
OK, you're all going to know eventually so you might as well know now.
I turned Benny down and I'm pregnant again.
So, in case your maths is bad, that makes six.
Six kids for an unmarried woman.
I don't want your sappy looks or your sympathy.
I don't even want to talk about this.
I just want to be left alone.
Got it?
Got it.
What are you people made of, stone?

{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
PETERSON CRUSOE A Bloody Mary for you.
Vodka Collins, and an Old Fashioned, light on the bitters.
Diane, I think you got it perfect this time.
Every drink wrong.
My God, what is this?
Does your waitressing stink!
- My waitressing does not stink.
- It does, too.
- It doesn't.
- Does.
If I put my mind to it, I could waitress circles around you.
You stink!
- I smell a wager.
- No, you smell your waitressing.
I challenge you to a waitressing contest.
Whoever gets the most tips tonight wins.
You're on, sucker.
I'll even give you a ten buck head start.
That's an insult!
And thank you.
We'll need a judge to make sure this contest is conducted fairly.
It's Sam's bar, he can be judge.
I'm honoured, but wouldn't it be better to find someone who gives a rat's behind?
- I do, make me the judge.
- We couldn't have a more impartial one.
Thank you, Diane.
If either of you suspects any wrongdoing, come to me and I'll make an immediate and final decision.
- Do we have any appeal?
- I think you're both cute, but that's not going to affect my decision.
Get ready for the good times.
The big guy doth approach.
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm?
Norman?
Why don't you sit down, Norm?
What's the problem?
You know that job I landed over in Braintree?
I had to take a company physical this afternoon and there was something on the chest X-ray.
- Something bad, Normie?
- No, a happy face.
Sorry, Coach.
Yes, something bad.
A spot of some sort.
They sent it over to a specialist to take a look.
Come on, Norm, these things happen sometimes and they turn out to be nothing, They come to nothing.
Yeah, we all come to nothing, Sam.
I'm just going to get there a little sooner.
Norman, you're jumping to conclusions.
Now stop being so morbid.
Ever since I heard this news, all I can think of is how I may be coming to the end of my life with nothing to show for it.
You've got all of us, your friends.
We're going to be with you all the way.
We're going to have to have the surgery and everything, Diane?
I'm not saying I won't do it!
- I'll explain it later, Coach.
- Everybody says, "I'll explain it later.
" Cheers.
Oh, hi.
Yeah.
Norm, it's Vera.
She needs to talk to you right away.
She's heard from the doctor.
Hi, honey.
Yeah, that's what I figured.
So what did he say?
That's the greatest news.
I can't believe it.
Yes, we do have something to celebrate.
So what are you going to do?
That sounds good.
I don't know what I'll do, but I can't think about it now, I have a lot of other things on my mind.
I'll talk to you later, honey.
A flaw on the X-ray.
- Let me buy you a drink, Normie.
- No, not right now, Cliff.
Right now I'm going to take a little walk with a gentleman I haven't paid attention to lately Norm Peterson.
- I think I understand.
- I don't, but I'm sure you'll tell me later.
Carla, counting the ten buck head start you gave Diane, you're still ahead nine dollars.
And you've got only one minute to go.
Yeah, but Diane gave me a good contest.
I mean, she hustled what passes for her buns off tonight.
- Good.
So you won't rub her nose in it?
- To the bone.
Thank you very much, and a happy fiftieth wedding anniversary to you both.
- Fiftieth anniversary!
- They had a bottle of Dom Perignon.
I thought they were just a couple of cheap old coots!
Coach, a twenty dollar tip.
- That's it!
Diane wins it!
- Really?
This is so exciting!
Yeah, who's going to sleep tonight?
Don't hurt me!
I didn't mean to gloat, Carla.
I'm sorry.
Please don't hurt me.
I just wanted to shake your hand, but if you don't want to shake my hand, I'll just say congratulations.
Sometimes there is no pleasure in conquest.
I haven't forgotten our first night together either.
- Did you find Norm?
- Yeah, is he weirding out.
- What do you mean?
- I found him sitting in a garden.
He said he wanted to smell the roses.
- I don't think that's weird.
- It was a vegetable garden.
That's weird.
Yeah, I said that.
He said, "So I want to smell the squash.
Leave me alone.
" Then he wandered on towards the pier.
I shudder to think what he wants to smell down there.
This is that bar I was telling you about.
These people sit here night after night, wasting their lives away.
But don't hate them.
Pity them, as I do.
They're chained here, unable to soar free like you and me.
Soar, little guy, soar.
You want to have a beer or something?
No time for that.
I just stopped in to say goodbye.
I'm sailing for Bora Bora.
Bora Bora?
Ever since I was a boy, the South Pacific has called, "Come to me, Norm.
This is where you belong.
" I've always ignored that call, till now.
So I'm going to go to the beach and build a hut, send for Vera, and live there the rest of our lives.
Isn't that nice?
I booked passage on one of those cargo ships where you work light duties.
We shove off at midnight, so Wait a minute.
What about a passport?
What about shots?
I already have my passport.
You don't need shots for Bora Bora, there's no disease there.
Lunacy is on its way.
Norm?
What about that great new job you got?
I should really call that guy, shouldn't I?
Sam, you see what he's doing, right?
The old jokemeister, tugging at our ankles?
Hold onto your socks, here he goes.
Hi, Mr Feldman, sir?
Hi, Norm Peterson here.
Awfully sorry to wake you, sir.
I'm not coming to work tomorrow.
I'm sailing to Bora Bora to live in a hut.
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I am in a bar.
No, my head's quite clear, sir.
I'm quitting.
Yes, I realise I'm burning my bridges, but there's no hard feelings on this end.
In fact, if you're ever in Bora Bora, stop by the Peterson hut and we'll share a cup of grog, sir.
Maybe I'll take you out Right, I realise it's late, sir.
Very sorry.
I pity that man.
Sammy, I want you to give these to some poor soul who may need them.
Well, everybody, this is goodbye.
I don't know what to say to you folks.
You've been like family to me.
- I'm going to miss you all, that's for sure.
- Come on, man, this is nuts.
People don't drop everything and sail away to Bora Bora.
- I do.
- Goodbye, Normie.
Coach, you'll feel silly when he pulls the plug on this gag.
- You understand, don't you, Coach?
- No, Normie, but they'll tell me later.
You better get used to that.
They got all-male crews on those ships.
OK, Norm, joke's over.
Knock it off.
It's ended.
Norm You kidder.
Boy, you had us going there for a while.
Wingtips are for accountants, Cliffie.
I'm a beachcomber now.
Normie's gone.
Here you are.
The service was excellent.
That was nothing.
You should have seen me in the old days.
I was something then.
I'm telling you, people would come from miles away to see me schlep drinks.
That was before The Troubles.
She should be over this by now, it's been weeks.
I robbed her zest for life.
You do have that effect on people.
Sam, we got another letter from Normie.
Oh, good.
Norm letter here, everybody.
OK, let me see here.
He says he's found the beach he was looking for and he's built a hut.
Wait, listen to this, "I'll send for Vera when I've built hers, ha ha!
"Whoops, I've lost my hammer, ha ha"!
- He put the "ha ha's" in.
- Good thing.
"Every morning, a native girl leaves a coconut outside my door.
"I'm a little shaky on the local tribal customs, "so either we're married or I'm going to be sacrificed next Tuesday, ha ha"!
He sure knows where to put those "ha ha's".
" Prhi, or goodbye.
Norm.
" It took a great deal of courage for Norman to do what he did.
I admire and envy him.
He has heeded Thoreau who admonished us that, quote, "Life is frittered away by detail.
Simplify, simplify.
" Why didn't he just say one 'simplify'?
Let me see the old postmark there, Sammy.
Yep, she's valid, all right.
Looks like our Normie made it to paradise.
Yeah.
Two Scotch rocks, Coach.
No hurry.
I'll wait till the good waitress gets her order.
Carla, you are the better waitress.
It's been proven time and time again.
What does it matter who won that meaningless contest?
It matters.
What would it take to make you feel better?
- Hearing you admit that you cheated.
- Carla, I didn't cheat.
Would it kill you to say you did?
- I did not cheat.
- Two words to restore my will to live.
It doesn't seem like that much to ask.
OK, Carla, I cheated.
You cheated?
Why?
That contest meant that much to you?
You are a very sick woman.
Does anybody in this bar realise how sick this woman is?
- She cheated on that silly little contest.
- I did not cheat!
First she says she cheated, then she says she didn't.
What are we supposed to believe?
- The things people do for their egos.
- Yeah, cheating on a silly contest.
I could go around explaining to everyone what happened, but I know that I did not cheat and that's enough.
- I'll just let it drop.
- I'll be in my office if you need me.
I did not cheat!
We had this contest - Evening, Sammy.
- Hey, Norm.
Norm?
Why aren't you in Bora Bora?
Funniest thing.
I chickened out, just like everybody said I would.
Never even got on the damn boat.
These are getting stale, though.
Got any beer nuts?
You you've been hiding in here?
Just for a week.
- Why?
- You kidding?
I made such a jackass out of myself, I'd be a laughing stock if I went out there.
- So you plan to stay in here forever?
- Yeah, is that a problem?
The way I figure it, you can let me in in the morning when you come to work, and when everyone goes home, let me out.
Just like I always did.
"Just like I always did.
" You get a bar stool, right?
Set it up nice and close like this.
Every now and then you slip me a beer.
Come on, it'll be just like it used to be!
Come on.
I know how you feel, man.
You had a crazy dream, announced it to everybody and you didn't live up to it.
But these people love you.
They don't care.
Come on.
All right, all right.
It probably meant more to me than it does to them anyway.
Maybe you ought to A toast to the man the natives are probably calling the Great Tanned Beast.
An inspiration to us all, Norm Peterson!
The sofa opens out into a bed, and - Laundry day is?
- Tuesday.
I have never cheated on anything in my life.
The integrity of Diane Chambers remains unblemished.
Could we chat for just a second?
Trust me.
These people are your friends.
Just listen.
Another toast.
To Paul Gauguin, Robert Louis Stevenson and Norm Peterson.
Three men cut from the same cloth, only they had to use a few more yards for Norm.
Yeah, Norm is quite a guy, isn't he?
I don't think he had to sail to the South Pacific to make us admire and respect him.
He did for me.
It was the only worthwhile thing he ever did in an otherwise wasted life.
I'm serious.
If Norm hadn't gone to Bora Bora, I don't think we would have thought any the less of him.
Do you?
- Of course we would.
- Definitely.
- Sam, what are you talking about?
- It's hypothetical.
Just suppose that Norm had spent the last three weeks in a motel, and that he gave those letters to some guy to mail when he got to the islands, we wouldn't think any the less of him.
- That yellow belly is in your office!
- Don't be silly.
If he's not, he's not going to mind me doing this.
Swell friends I have.
That's the last you'll see of Norm Peterson.
Yellow belly, you've got a lot of guts showing your face here!
Lay off, will you?
The guy feels terrible.
Yeah?
Yeah, welcome back, buddy.
He's afraid that you will laugh at him because he chickened out.
Norman?
Everyone has had a dream that they let slip away.
Yeah, but not one everyone knew about.
- Would you like to know about mine?
- Not particularly.
No.
When I was a child, I wanted to be a ballerina.
I had I had years of private lessons, but when the time finally came to audition for the Juilliard School, with my first step I fell down and bloodied my nose.
And before I could do anything else, they said, "Thank you very much.
" - I never heard from them again.
- Thank you very much.
OK, Diane, very good, dear.
Thank you.
Norm, do you want to hear a crazy, hopeless dream?
I wanted to play baseball and maybe coach a little.
And then afterwards tend a bar in a nice place.
Look what happened to me.
Coach, that's exactly what happened to you.
Oh, yeah.
No wonder I'm such a happy guy.
Good try, Coach, good try.
Norm, has any of this helped you?
Yeah, I'm doing a jig in here, Sam.
Go away!
All right, Sammy, clear the decks.
It's up to me.
Normie, it's your best buddy.
Go away, Frank.
Even in pain he can make us smile.
Norm?
You know it's Cliffie.
And I, too, once had a dream, Norm.
No, more than a dream, really.
It was an all-consuming passion.
- I wanted to be a trapeze artist.
- Trapeze artist?
Like in a circus?
No, like in your finer restaurants, Sam.
When I was a lad I saw "Trapeze" with Burt Lancaster and Tony Curtis.
No kidding, Cliffie.
Did you sit between them?
I must have seen it 20 times.
I always imagined myself up there with them, high above the centre ring.
The spotlight shines upon me, sweat glistens from my body.
Below me the women's eyes glaze over with lust, the men grind their teeth with envy.
I lunge at the bar with almost an insane daring.
I fly through the air completing, one, two, three, oh, my God, four somersaults.
The first quadruple in the history of the big top, Norm!
But, I became a postal carrier and the rest is history.
No, Norm, having a dream isn't stupid.
It's not having them that's stupid.
What's stupid is the picture of you in one of those outfits.
Stop laughing at my pal here, all right?
This man had the only dream that was more ridiculous than mine.
- Yeah?
- A lot more, I might add.
Is that right, Marco Rollo?
I've got to buy a drink here for the great Cliffini.
The next round is on me for Ferdinand Magelly-belly.
- Listen to the Flying Rear-enda here.
- Is that right, Christopher Colum-butt?

{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
A DITCH IN TIME - Good afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!
- What'll you have, Normie?
- A 1929 Lafitte Rothschild, Coach.
Or a beer, whatever everyone's having.
Haven't heard much lately about your quest to sire an heir for the old throne.
- So how goeth the baby-making?
- Not good.
Vera thinks it's my fault she's not pregnant.
Says I'm not trying.
I hope before you answered harshly, you took into account her frustration in the maternal instinct department.
- I said, "Drop dead in a ditch.
" - Perfect.
I used to think that sleeping was the greatest pleasure you could have in bed.
Now I'm sure of it.
Norm, what's the matter?
Don't you like having sex with your wife?
We're not exactly what each other wants in a sexual partner.
For example, she wishes I looked a little more like Charles Bronson.
And I wish she looked a little less like Charles Bronson.
Carla, what do you think of my new cologne?
- What do you think?
- I like it.
When will I be able to see again?
Thank you.
- You have customers waiting.
- Right away.
Will someone lead me to them?
- White wine, please.
- White wine.
Coach, I'll handle this one.
I hope this doesn't embarrass you too much, but you have the most beautiful eyes that I have ever seen.
I kinda get flustered, but it's nice to hear.
If I said you had a beautiful body, would you hold it against me?
Even I've heard that one.
I'm not doing too well with my patter.
Maybe I ought to rely on my looks.
Have you seen this one?
I guess I'm just a sucker for sophistication.
Now I've charmed your socks off, wanna go to dinner with me?
You know a place that doesn't require socks?
I could find one.
So what do you say?
I can't leave yet.
I came to see somebody.
Who?
So you two know each other, huh?
Nothing gets by this guy.
Sam, this is my friend Amanda Boyer.
Amanda, this is my friend, Sam Malone.
You're gonna have to excuse us here, I think we're on our way out to dinner.
Actually, I came by to see you.
You wanna have lunch sometime?
Lunch sometime Are you two going out together?
You're pretty sharp yourself there, Diane.
Before you do, could I speak with you about a problem, Sam?
- Trouble in the back room.
- It's not about me, is it?
Don't be silly.
That woman's a mess.
- Don't go out with her.
- Why not?
I can't tell you now.
Just trust me for once.
You'll have to give me a hint.
I really can't say anything.
I can't believe you're so blatantly jealous.
You still can't stand the sight of me with another woman, huh?
My heart goes out to any living creature in your company.
One of these days you're gonna realise that if you want to get back together with me, you'll have to talk a little nicer.
Sam - You are an unmitigated egomaniac.
- Too little, too late.
Good night.
You know, Normie, I was just thinking.
When you and Vera have the baby, you'll have to give it a name, right?
We might name it, yeah.
When it comes time to name the baby, you should consider Barry.
What's so special about Barry?
He's a whizz with names.
He gave me my nickname.
- Coach?
- What?
Never mind.
As I was saying, Barry gave me my nickname, Coach.
That was inventive.
You were a coach, so he called you Coach.
You know, you're probably right, Larry.
I always thought he gave me the name because I never flew first class.
We won't need Barry's help.
We've got a list of names to fight over.
Once the baby's born we'll fight over boy names or girl names.
You don't have to wait till the baby's born if you use sonar.
Yeah, Sonar's a beautiful name.
- Hey, everybody.
- Sam.
What happened?
That was a long dinner.
This is pitiful, you wearing your heart on your sleeve like that.
- How did you and Amanda get along?
- She's OK, I guess.
Not triple A, but the food was good and she's got pretty good table manners.
High praise from a man who thinks mashed potatoes are finger food.
So you didn't make any plans to see each other again?
I like it when a woman is hot for me, but this is ridiculous.
It's not your business, but I might call her again.
Oh, no.
I wish Frasier weren't at that nerve-ending symposium.
I guess I have to tell you the truth.
Amanda and I became friends at a place.
That's pretty fascinating.
You'll have to fill me in on that later.
The place was Goldenbrook.
The booby hatch?
Oh, no, she looked so normal.
Were you guys cellmates or something?
There are no cells at Goldenbrook.
I was there of my own volition as were a lot of other normal people who just needed a little time to rest and sort out their feelings under constant psychiatric supervision.
I shouldn't even be talking to you.
She wouldn't be out if she still had problems.
You're out.
What exactly is wrong with that kid?
I didn't want to say because we did group therapy together and I didn't want to violate her confidence.
I guess I have to tell you now.
Please don't ever tell another soul.
- Amanda is obsessive with men.
- Oh, my God, no!
Wait a second.
What does that mean, exactly?
She likes men a lot?
When she decides she wants a man, she becomes excessively preoccupied and possessive, and totally irrational.
Oh, you mean kinda like you landa.
Yolanda Johnson.
You don't know her.
Very obsessive woman.
She is nothing like Youlanda.
Listen, I wasn't thinking about it, but if I ever do go out with her again, the first sign of trouble, I'll back off.
OK?
Wait a second, what's an example of obsessive behaviour?
Mom, Dad, there he is, the man I'm gonna marry.
This is an example.
Sam, these are my parents, Mona and Todd.
- Hello, Sam.
- We've heard so much about you.
When?
On the drive over here.
It was a long drive.
- I feel like I know you.
- Daddy, stop it.
Mom and Dad came to visit me and I thought it'd be nice for them to meet you.
- Can we have a word in private?
- Hi, Amanda.
Mona, Todd.
Sam I need to talk to you about the inventory.
We'll be right back.
That girl looks familiar.
Is she the one I met on Basket Day?
What were you going to do when I interrupted?
Get rid of her before this gets serious.
Sam, better get out there.
She's picking silver patterns with her parents.
Yeah, I told them fleurs-de-lis are passé, they won't listen to me.
We're trying to have a private conversation.
We're not trying to be nosy, just go ahead.
Very well.
You can't give her your standard prearranged speech for dumping women.
I do not have a standard prearranged speech for dumping women.
Every situation is different.
For example, the speech I dumped you with would be totally inappropriate.
I don't think you dumped me.
You see?
That was the beauty of it.
Come on, I couldn't possibly have one speech for every situation.
He's got six.
I think this one calls for number three: "It's times like these, I'm ashamed to be a man.
" - Get out!
- Wait a minute, Diane.
Sam's a very close personal friend.
He's in a crisis and I don't think OK, have a couple of beers on me.
Sammy, you know where to find us if you need any help.
- Oh, boy.
- Sam That woman out there is very vulnerable.
Whatever you say to her has to be sensitive and real.
Otherwise the consequence could be horrendous.
What do you mean by that?
She could do something ghastly again.
- You don't mean - Yes, suicide.
Oh, thank God!
I thought I was in danger there.
No, that's not what I meant.
You're making me a nervous wreck.
Just tell me what to say so she doesn't hurt herself.
- I wish I knew.
- Come on, come on.
- She'll try to manipulate you.
- OK.
Be strong.
Don't waver.
- And ease into the rejection gently.
- OK, do you think that'll work?
If not, have a nice honeymoon.
- Hi, I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
- That's OK.
They like you a lot.
You make a wonderful first impression.
It's my best one.
Amanda, I Please, please don't dump me!
Please, Sam, give me another chance.
I shouldn't have brought my parents, that was stupid and impulsive of me.
I don't even like them, I'll get rid of them.
No, no.
Wait.
I was just gonna say I wonder if they would like to have a drink.
No, thank you, they don't drink.
But thank you for thinking of them.
You're welcome.
- Then I was gonna say - No!
Please, Sam Would you just please let me finish before you jump to conclusions?
Now just sit down and don't say anything.
Sorry.
It's OK.
I like you and I respect you too much not to be honest.
Now I'm sorry if I misled you, but I just don't want to pursue this relationship.
I'm so embarrassed and ashamed and tired.
I'm very tired.
I'm sorry, Sam, for everything.
Goodbye, Sam.
- Are you all right?
- Oh, sure.
It's my fault.
You are such a nice guy.
Please don't blame yourself for anything that has ever happened.
Or anything that's going to happen.
Whoa, wait a second.
What do you mean by that?
Sam, you don't have to worry about me any more.
Remember?
We're through.
I didn't mean the bad 'through', I meant the good 'through'.
What's the good 'through'?
That's where we would go out to dinner right now and then maybe have a drive down the Cape, and see each other tomorrow.
The Cape would be pretty tonight.
I'd like that, Sam.
There, you see how fun 'through' can be?
I'll get my parents and we'll drop them off at some bus stop.
- You have another date with her, right?
- I wouldn't call it exactly a date.
It's more like a lifetime commitment.
My goodness, you and Vera have compiled quite a list of baby names.
Yeah, we think up names when we make love.
It kinda helps to pass the time.
May I suggest you add one more to the boys' list?
- My favourite has always been Toby.
- Toby?
Why don't you just name him Precious or Pumpkin Pie and be done with it?
My ex may not be a class act, but he's got a first-rate male name, Nick.
- It's on the list.
- Good.
You ought to have Sam down there.
- Sam's here, right next to Ernie.
- Thank you, Norm.
It looks like my buddy's got all the bases covered.
- Where's my name?
- What?
Clifford.
Where's Clifford?
Come on, name a kid Cliff?
Have a heart!
You got every other male name there except Zeus.
Zeus?
I like that, Zeus.
Diane, you're back.
Good.
You might like to know I finally handled that situation with Amanda, in a way you'll be proud of.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Oh, gotta go.
I know that Sam would not have wanted a big fuss, but shouldn't we have some sort of funeral for him?
Good Lord!
Amanda, I think we'd better straighten this out.
Sam!
- Sam, open the door.
We have to talk.
- Has the freak show gone yet?
Oh, hi.
We haven't been introduced yet.
I'm Ed, Sam's twin brother.
I'm here to handle the estate.
Oh, boy.
Twin brother.
What a trick, huh?
That's why he's the boss.
I can't believe you did this to me, Sam.
I'm sorry, Amanda.
I know it was stupid and cruel and I could have handled it better.
I guess I could have pretended to be sick for a few days first.
You don't have to apologise, Sam.
I do.
I put you in a terrible spot.
Don't despair.
Just when my life seemed to be its darkest, I met Frasier Crane, and learned love doesn't have to hurt.
Yeah, you can sleep right through it.
I made a lot of mistakes here, Sam.
And I have a history of being wrong about men.
But I know it's different this time with you.
No matter what happens, I'll never stop loving you.
Till the day I die, you'll always be mine.
This is going pretty well, wouldn't you say?
Amanda, I didn't want to say this.
It's something that will change the way you feel about Sam.
Nothing you could ever say will change the way I feel about him.
- Except this.
- Except nothing.
No matter what you ever do, no matter where you ever go, I'll never get over you.
Amanda, do you remember the man I used to talk about in group therapy?
- Ralph?
- This is Ralph.
Sam is Ralph?
That's right.
The man to whom you just pledged your undying love is Ralph.
He can't hold me to that.
If they won't let me sign contracts or have a credit card or vote, then I am not responsible for hysterical hogwash that I babbled in a bar.
Thank you for saving me, Diane.
Sam, I will think of you every time I see something scurry under the sink.
I don't mean to seem ungrateful, but what exactly did you say about me in group therapy?
- I told them the truth.
- For instance?
I don't wanna get into this.
I made a lot of mistakes myself.
I was not a perfect girlfriend.
No, come on, I wanna know what lousy things these people know about me.
- I told them about Christmas.
- That again?
What is wrong with giving steak knives?
My mother loved them.
I give them to you and I never hear the end of it.
Sam, I was your lover.
You could have given me something more personal.
What did you give me for Christmas?
A scarf.
What's so personal about that?
I knit it myself.
And I had to take classes to learn how.
I sent away for the cashmere months before just to get that particular grade.
I consulted a colourist to determine the best colours for you and I hand-dyed the fabric myself.
I would have made the steak knives except I hocked my forge to buy the bar.
What else?
I told them about the time I had flu and you didn't visit me once.
And you sent me second-hand flowers for Valentine's Day.
- Well, I was nowhere near - You wanna hear this or not?
I told them about the time I cooked you a seven-course dinner for your birthday and you had a burger on the way over.
There was an explanation.
I just can't remember what it was.
And the time you lied about a relative dying so you could go skiing and debauching with your buddies.
You still don't see the humour in that?
I wanted to spend the day with you after our first night together and you went to a football game.
It wasn't a football game.
- The winners went to the play-offs.
- Oh, just forget it!
I'm sorry.
- What?
- I'm sorry.
I did the best I could when I was with you.
You're right, I have blind spots and I'm not a very good boyfriend, but I never tried harder with any woman in my life.
We had some bad times, but the good times with you were some of the best of my life.
That's the nicest thing you've ever said to me.
- Diane, I - No, Sam, stop.
I want to get out of here before you say something stupid that ruins it.
- No, no, now stop.
Don't ruin it.
- I'm not gonna ruin it.
Yeah, that woulda ruined it.
Would it ever!

THE HEART IS A LONELY SNIPEHUNTER - Vodka martini and a Seltzer.
- You got it.
Thank you.
Beer.
Holy coyote!
What's that stink?
Smells like they're burning the chef's special at Melville's.
Smells like they're burning the chef.
No.
Wait, I know what that smell is.
- Anybody mind if I smoke?
- Not if you put the lit end in your mouth.
I learned how to smoke them this way, Carla, and I'll stick with it.
- Boy, is somebody boiling tar in here?
- No, Sam.
I'm smoking my cigar.
Would someone please boil some tar?
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!
- What's new, Normie?
- Terrorists, Sam.
They've taken over my stomach and they're demanding beer.
- It's a world gone mad.
- What's that stench?
It's my cigar, Normie.
Let me know if it bothers you.
- It bothers me.
- Join the club.
New cologne, Sam?
It's a step up.
Do you have any idea how much that cigar stinks?
Are you kidding?
It's right below my nose.
- Sammy, all set to - You bet, good buddy.
Did that gesture signify a primitive mating ritual?
Actually we are going up to the woods to spend the day fishing.
Fishing.
How lovely.
You know, it's truly essential to one's peace of mind now and then to get back in tune with the rhythms of nature and shed the mechanised world.
You're right.
Did you remember to bring the TV set?
- Yeah.
I got a portable VCR, Sam.
- Good.
- I rented "Porky's ll" and "Splash".
- All right.
- You have a fish tracking device, too?
- That wouldn't be sportsmanlike.
We prefer depth charges.
- So, you guys are going fishing?
- Yeah, go pull some lip.
- You got it.
- Boy, I love fishing.
- A spur-of-the-moment decision?
- No, we've planned this.
- Check this lake.
- Looks good.
- I guess you forgot to tell me.
- I don't know.
I don't remember.
Well, I do.
You didn't.
Maybe you mentioned it to another best friend who lives for doing manly things in the wild.
You want to go fishing with us?
I don't want to infringe on you and Norm's good time.
You're going to have to if you want come along.
Come on, let's go fishing.
- I'd better check my social calendar.
- That's the wall of the men's room.
- I wouldn't mind doing a little fishing.
- Me neither.
You got room?
What the hell?
Let's make it a party.
- I thought it was just going to be us.
- Come on, Cliff.
I'm just surprised you are so eager to go someplace you're obviously not wanted.
There's some gear in the back there, guys.
- Hello, Diane.
- Hi, Frasier.
Your lips are troubled.
No wonder.
Look at the hell he puts them through.
Well, this has been a bad day.
Bad week.
Bad month.
This time of the year is murder on the psychiatric profession.
Just sit down and relax.
- Scotch, Sam.
- You have problems there, Frase?
All the neuroses I face every day have a negative effect on me.
Why don't you do what I did?
Throw her clothes in the hallway and lock the door.
Diane is my salvation.
It's my patients that have caused this distress.
Miserable people pouring out their litany of depression and anxiety.
The only way my situation could be worse is if I listened to them.
Even at a time like this, his humour survived.
I know exactly what you're saying, Doc.
I do.
After years behind this bar, I've learned how to make people happy.
How's that?
Whatever problem they got, I point out the bigger problem.
Like in your case, you're going bald.
I am?
Now I'm depressed and losing my hair.
That's nothing.
It's child's play compared to that big mole you got on your neck.
- Please, no more.
I'm cheered up.
- Any time, Doc.
All right, Sammy.
Just one quick stop to change clothes and we'll be all set.
Okey-dokey.
Hope things look up for you, Frasier.
- Going fishing, are you?
- Yeah.
How idyllic.
Away from the noise, the crime, the borderline psychotics.
Actually, Cliffie's coming along, too.
I was just kidding, Cliff.
OK, Coach.
Good night.
See you guys.
Be back later.
Sam, it looks like you might have room for one more.
Isn't there someone else you'd like to invite?
A very depressed gentleman?
The bass are about this big there.
Want to go get one?
I've never been fishing but it might be just what I need.
- If none of you mind, count me in.
- Goody.
Watch out, fish.
Here I come.
You want to come along?
We're running a little low on bait.
Cut it out, you kidder.
Take care of my fella.
He's a tenderfoot.
- How come you're not going?
- I don't like to smell them.
- Yeah, fish stink.
- No, the guys.
Out in that sun all day, stuck in the muck.
Who needs it?
- Want to play Red Sox trivia?
- Sure.
Fire away.
Good.
I got some real tough ones for you this time.
Ready?
Number one.
What over 300 hitter was called - Jimmy Foxx.
- Right.
That was just an easy warm-up.
Now we're going to start.
Shoot.
- What Red Sox shortstop - Don Buddin.
- An outfielder - Conigliaro.
Boy, you are good.
Try me now.
- Who was the only man to pinch hit - Lu Clinton.
- You sure you want to go on?
- It's not as much fun as it used to be.
- Think we've played together too long?
- Was the next answer Frank Malzone?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Looks like you had a good time.
- Great time, Diane.
Great time.
I'm so glad.
Where's Frasier?
Did I say something amusing?
You're going to get a giggle out of this.
Frasier's still up in the woods.
He's snipe hunting.
You sent him on a snipe hunt.
I love it.
What's a snipe hunt?
It's an age-old custom wherein we take an uninitiated hunter like Dr Crane, put him in a clearing with a gunnysack and we beat out the snipe to him.
Rather an elemental sport but I don't see the humour in it.
The humour is that while the guy's out there with a gunnysack, we have dinner in a restaurant and come here for some beers.
There's no such thing as a snipe, so there's no reason for us to hang around.
But since the bagger doesn't know that, he stays and we leave.
I swear to you, this is really funny.
You should have seen your buddy.
He's a real sport.
He was practising the bagger's position.
Sammy made up this terrific snipe call.
- Actually somebody else made that up.
- You could hear him from miles.
In other words, you abandoned Frasier in the woods.
Well, that's another way of putting it.
But it doesn't sound as funny that way.
Of all the immature, aberrant behaviour ever exhibited here, this is the lowest.
- What do you mean, Sam?
- You're the ringleader.
These lemmings don't have minds of their own.
- She's right, Sam.
- Sad but true, Sammy.
- She is not.
- Whatever you say, boss.
Would you guys Come on.
You're overreacting here, Diane.
It's a harmless little prank, that's all.
All guys fall for it.
It's fun.
- Did you ever fall for it?
- Not personally.
But a lot of my friends have and did they have a terrific time.
- You have to be a certain kind of guy.
- Yeah, a real dink.
Thanks a lot, Carla.
Come on, Frasier's got a sense of humour.
I bet he's up in the woods right now laughing himself silly.
I am sure that he is not.
Like many who enter the psychiatric profession, Frasier is a trusting man.
You took advantage of his trust.
He turned to you for a day of relaxation and instead you gave him this - a cruel, malicious, moronic prank.
A good-natured, fun, character-building, moronic prank.
If there's any decency among you, you'll go back and find him.
- I'll go.
- Thank you for that flash of humanity.
I can't believe this.
I'm furious with all of you for what you did.
Frasier, I can explain.
Why did you introduce me to that sport?
I'm hooked on it.
I was hoping you'd come back here and I want to apologise.
After a couple of hours in the position, I heard some snipe in the bush, so I went off to pursue them and I got lost in the woods.
I scrambled about for a while until I heard the sound of cars.
So I flagged down an eighteen-wheeler and made my way back.
Good friends, I'm sorry.
I let you down.
It's the last thing I wanted to do.
- Frasier, are you sure you're all right?
- Diane, I'm aglow.
I'm transported.
I don't expect you to understand.
It has to do with the bond between men.
Sorry.
Coach, set up my buddies.
I want to drink to the camaraderie of this night.
- You don't have to do that, Frasier.
- Come on, what the hell?
- It is the bagger's prerogative.
- Marvellous tradition.
Let's drink to it.
May I have a word in private?
It's about what happened tonight.
You're interfering with male bonding.
To snipe hunting.
The most humane of sports.
No guns.
No knives.
Just a man and a plain simple bag.
Like you and Diane.
Come on.
Guys make jokes about their mates, right?
You probably think I'm being manic, but I haven't spent that much time out of doors in my life.
I was exhilarated.
It was a revelation to me how quiet it was.
I heard an owl for the first time.
I finally understand why guys get hung up on going to the woods - camping, fishing.
Wait until you come home with a snipe strapped to the hood of your car?
That's a thrill of a lifetime.
My one regret is we didn't get a snipe.
It's all my fault.
- I let you guys down.
- No, you didn't disappoint us.
If there's one thing you didn't do, it was disappoint us.
I think it's time that we told you a little something here.
The fellas and I I hate to interrupt, but you should go freshen up.
You're right, Diane.
I'm filthy.
I want to thank all of you for caring enough to include me tonight.
I don't believe it.
That guy is a bigger boob than Cliff.
No argument here.
What was the problem there?
- I was just going to tell him the truth.
- Do you have to?
What's the good if you can't laugh in his face about it?
Listen to me.
This may be hard for you to understand, most things are, but finding out that he was the butt of your joke would be devastating.
He's always been the odd-man-out.
The kids would choose up sides for softball, he was the last one picked.
"You take the girl, we'll take Frasier.
" Yeah, I remember.
I always used to feel sorry for those guys.
Even when I was doing it to them.
Yeah, Frasier was lucky.
Some children were laughed off the playground entirely.
- Not me.
I was always out there.
- And you still are.
Maybe I'm just lucky, but nothing like that ever really happened to me.
No.
Wait a minute, Sam.
When I told you that you weren't invited to the Red Sox alumni dinner this year?
I wasn't invited to the alumni dinner?
No, what am I talking about?
They're not even having a dinner.
But while I'm thinking about it, can I have Saturday night off?
- What for?
- Death in the family.
Sure.
Come on.
We got to tell Frasier.
You're holding up the laugh fest?
We don't have to tell Frasier and we're not going to ever.
- Then why did we do it?
- You're obviously bored with lip diddling.
He's going to find out eventually.
We should be the ones to tell him because we did the hard work.
He might not find out.
Frasier isn't an outdoorsman.
If he should find out about it years later, he'll be able to laugh about it.
Especially if some or all of you are dead.
- That isn't asking much, is it?
- Well, actually I - Sam.
- What?
There's one other thing I want you to know.
Lord knows why, but Frasier thinks of you as a friend.
As a matter of fact, he thinks of you as one of his closest friends.
- Get out of here.
- He does, Sam.
Jeez, what a boo boo bootiful guy he is.
All right.
We'll do it your way.
Fellas, nobody tells Frasier the truth, OK?
Well, it's a stupid oversight.
If Sam Malone isn't invited, I'm not coming.
I'm kidding.
I'll be there.
Eight o'clock.
Wrong number.
Thank you, everyone.
Believe me, it's best to let this matter drop.
No need for Frasier to suffer any embarrassment.
"Let the matter drop.
" I deserted and now I need a woman to plead my case.
If you feel that strong about it, maybe, we could take another shot at it.
You'd do that for me?
Yeah, you bet we would.
- Fine.
Well, let's get back out there.
- Out where?
- In the wilds where the snipe run free.
- No.
I looked in the mirror.
Do you know what I saw?
A quitter.
A man who lets his buddies down.
I want to prove myself.
Well, hear that guys?
Looks like Frasier wants to go back out there tonight.
Absolutely.
Tonight is the night of the full moon.
Sam told me the snipe run best when it's a full moon.
- I said that.
- That's right.
- And they'd be running all night, right?
- I said that, too.
- Well, then what are we waiting for?
- Nothing.
Let's get out of here.
You're the first bagger I ever met to go snipe hunting twice in the same night.
You're going to go down in the annals.
Sam, please.
Thanks for making us promise not to tell him.
So we give him a double whammy.
Frasier, I need a moment alone with you.
- Can't this wait?
- We're feeling the thrill of the hunt.
- Yeah, so does Frasier.
- Frasier Women.
I guess she wants to kiss me.
You have to indulge them.
- Dames.
- That is why I don't have a girlfriend.
Reason number 27.
Frasier, sometimes people do thoughtless things.
They don't mean any harm.
They just don't know any better.
You sound like the psychologist I had at eight.
What are you trying to say?
They played a childish prank on you.
- I know that.
- What?
A man does not crouch in the woods for hours without having a revelation or two.
So this is part of a plan and I unwittingly helped you?
Yes.
Frasier, how devious.
But why didn't you tell me?
- You'd have thought it was too cruel.
- Are you kidding?
I would've helped.
- This is so unlike you.
- But it's what guys do.
We screw each other to the wall.
Boy, it's great to be one of the gang, I'll tell you.
When we get up to that clearing, I'm going to get them to pose for a photo.
After they disappear into the woods I'm going to rush drive back and make you one of my famous omelettes.
- Frasier, I find your cunning arousing.
- Well, that's what it's there for, baby.
I've got to share this with the troops.
Men.
You're not going to believe this but Diane just attempted to tell me that there's no such thing as a snipe.
They will say anything to keep me at home.
You will not be a snipe widow.
All right now, men.
Let's go get one.
To the woods.
I'm sorry, but in years to come we're going to have a good laugh over this.
- Not all of us will be laughing.
- You'll see.
Trust me.
- Hey, look, it's starting to snow.
- Don't worry, the colder the better.

{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
KING OF THE HILL - Coach, is this what I think it is?
- What do you think it is?
I think it's something totally useless that some salesman talked you into buying.
Boy, you're good at thinking, Sam.
"The Billiard Buddy Pool Table Adapter.
" Yeah, but it's not useless, Sam.
You can make it into a Ping-Pong table, a knock hockey table, a salad bar.
- How much?
- I don't know.
A buck and a half with croutons.
No, Coach, I mean how much for the whole thing?
"Satisfaction guaranteed.
" - Or?
- That would have been a good question.
$600?
Yeah, hard to believe, isn't it?
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!
- What'll it be?
- The usual.
I'll have a trough of beer and a snorkel.
Cliffie, maybe you could help me out.
- My mother-in-law's in town.
- Sorry.
- She wants to go sightseeing.
- Tell her to go to Florida.
I told her to go further south than that, but she's interested in American history.
Norman, take your mother to see Bunker Hill.
- Where?
- Bunker Hill.
The scene of one of the most important battles in American history.
That place I've got to go all the way around to get to the pizza parlour?
No way.
Hey, Norm, your car's unlocked.
- Someone might steal your laundry.
- What laundry?
That big bundle on the front seat.
That's my mother-in-law.
She had kind of a rough flight.
She nodded out the second she hit the upholstery.
And you left her out there in an unattended automobile?
I threw a blanket over her and I left her a note in case she comes to.
She's lucky to have you as a son-in-law, Norman.
I give her the red-carpet treatment, I guess.
Hey, pal.
Could you do me a favour and toss these in the blue Civic out in front?
- Is Sam Malone here?
- No.
What can I buy from you?
What am I saying?
What can I get you?
I'll have a beer.
My name is Lenny Barnes.
I'm the publicist for the charity softball game this Saturday.
I'm looking for Sam.
I can tell you right now.
He wouldn't be interested in that.
Nobody with any dignity wants to get into those sideshow carnival things, where everybody's made to look stupid.
- Aren't you Ernie Pantusso?
- I'd be honoured to do it.
- I don't think we need anybody else.
- Oh, well.
I find it hard to get up to Fenway these days.
The old memories come back?
No, I keep getting the wrong bus.
I must have an old schedule.
I guess those stories about you are true.
That they are, Lenny.
Mr Barnes, Coach is right.
Sam never plays in old-timer type games.
- Sam's already agreed to play.
- What?
I'm here for some publicity shots.
Lenny, why don't you take your beer and have a seat and wait for Sam?
- Thank you.
I have to make a call.
- Use the telephone.
I'm so surprised at Sam, Diane.
He always said to me he'd never get involved in one of these things.
Maybe Sam misses being out there on the baseball field standing on the bump.
You got a point there.
I miss seeing him out there on the bump, too, but incidentally, it's called a mound.
Unless we're not talking about the same thing.
Thank you, Carla, for helping me.
You're sure you want to quit?
I'm willing to catch a few more.
You weren't toying with the sound barrier out there.
No, I just wanted to loosen up a little bit, that's all.
I don't think you should be engaging in strenuous activity when you're with child.
If I didn't do things with child, I'd never leave the house.
The only thing I ever did without child resulted in one.
You're playing in this charity game?
Yeah.
I was out there warming up.
My arm feels good.
Are you kidding me?
When a butterfly lands on a ball in mid-flight, it's not cooking.
All I care about is not embarrassing myself.
- Good luck.
- I have a right to be a little rusty.
The only thing I've thrown in the past ten years is Diane's butt out of here.
No, you are thinking of the tantrums you threw when I walked out of here.
The only thing I enjoy hearing more than you two argue is hearing Cliff talk about Florida.
I was just about to tell Normie here that Florida is a pollution-free state.
You know how they treat solid waste?
You said they treated you very well.
- Hey, Sam.
- Lenny, how are you doing?
I'm fine.
I arranged to have a photographer and your opponents drop by for publicity stills.
- Right now?
- They should be here right away.
What brought about this sudden altruistic bent in your personality?
I resent that.
I've always cared deeply for people less fortunate than myself.
Here they are.
Sam, you great big humanitarian.
Who says you can't work for a worthy cause and still be sexually aroused?
You could be having an appendectomy and still be sexually aroused.
Be that as it may.
I have to excuse myself now and go say hello to my fellow do-gooders.
- Are those dames or what?
- This is disgusting.
In what kind of culture do I live where they are the ideal woman?
You've got admit they are beautiful.
Coach, take away all their make-up, all their expensive haircuts and those bodies and what have you got?
You.
- Hey, they're Playboy Playmates.
- Get out of here.
I recognise Miss February of a few years back.
She's a native of Montana, hates the hustle and bustle of the big city.
Her turn-ons include strong but sensitive men, classical music and rainy afternoons.
Hard to believe that Vera and those are the same sex.
Excuse me.
Does anyone have a blue Civic with a bumper sticker that says, - "Accountants Do It With Interest"?
- That would be mine.
It's true.
- They're towing it away.
- You noticed an old lady getting out?
- No.
- Great.
Another round, Coach.
- What about your mother-in-law?
- She's safe.
The cops have her.
- So my place or yours?
- I have a roommate.
Yours it is.
- Would you take your drink?
- Are you upset about something?
You know what bugs me about women like you?
You take off all your clothes, you pose for a magazine, thousands of men see you naked.
I have to go to them one by one.
It's not fair.
You look gorgeous, Sam.
Get up there and put your arms around the girls.
Put my arms around them, you say?
Squeeze in there real tight, Sam.
That's good.
OK.
Tell me, Sam, how do you feel about the game on Saturday?
It's a challenge of a lifetime.
We're looking at natural assets that will play havoc with the strike zone.
No, I'm looking forward to the game and I'm particularly looking forward to the shower afterwards.
Seriously, it will be a great game.
I hope that everybody comes out to support a worthy cause.
Step down and let me get a shot of the girls.
Put them over here by the door.
I know what you're thinking and I don't care.
If you think I'm even concerned, you are wrong.
Your sortie into sordidness has no effect on my emotions.
You could make love to all five of those women and I would feel nothing.
As I'm sure would they.
Let me introduce you to the girls.
I'd like to show them the charity I was involved with last year.
You are a sand flea.
That's the thanks I get?
Hey, Coach, what happened to our pool table?
It's still there, but thanks to our Billiard Buddy Adaptor, it's more fun than ever.
It can be a knock hockey table, a Ping-Pong table.
You name it.
I want a pool table.
Let me get out my easy-to-follow conversion instructions here.
Tool kit.
For moving And that.
- Coach, how long is this going to take?
- 20 minutes.
- 20 minutes to put it together?
- No, to figure what the hell this is.
- Forget it.
I'll play Ping-Pong.
- God bless you.
The play of the game was when Angela had to reach back to catch that foul ball.
That was a thing of beauty, Normie.
The best one was Ginger bending down to catch that grounder.
I had to applaud.
Let's not forget when Rosemary and Ginger kind of bumped into each other.
Either one of you manage to sneak a peak at the scoreboard?
There was a scoreboard?
The final score was Sam's team seven, Playmates zero.
He was blowing those girls away.
It was a massacre.
I lost track of the final strike outs, but the important thing is the twinkies lost.
- Did you hear I got 18 strike outs?
- Sam, I counted 17.
The ump was blind.
That ball cut the corner.
Drinks are on me.
We're celebrating.
Sammy, what happened to the Playmates?
I thought they were coming here after the game.
They were.
I guess they're sore losers.
What happened to sportsmanship?
Maybe they were put off by your victory laps.
Come on, man.
That was just a joke.
That was a pretty good game, wasn't it?
I really had my stuff back.
- Wasn't it supposed to be for fun?
- That's right.
I had a great time.
Hey, guys, I really had my stuff.
Magnificent, Sam.
Any chance the girls'll be by?
Would you guys forget the girls here?
I just won a game, didn't let anybody pass first base and you're pretending it is an ordinary day.
Excuse me.
I'm not an expert in the field of sports, but it's my impression that the fans paid to see the little Playmates wiggling their heinies around the bases.
You're the last person I want to talk to today.
You're not in the top five any day, but for your information, people paid good money to watch Sam Malone pitch.
I paid for heinies.
Come on!
People don't pay to watch their baseball stars stink.
They pay to watch them relive their old glories.
Sammy I was more thrilled than anybody to see you out there flinging it again, but even I was a little embarrassed when you put one in Babette's ear cos she was crowding the plate.
Hey, the plate belongs to me.
If she can't stand the heat, she shouldn't have crossed the baseline.
- We're celebrating, guys.
- Sam, you knocked a girl down?
No, Coach, I didn't knock a girl down.
I knocked a batter down.
- She was halfway across the plate.
- Halfway across.
She deserves it.
- Let's celebrate.
- Yes, by all means.
Let's celebrate.
This is a major accomplishment, Sam.
I think you're ready to take on the Camp Fire Girls All-Stars.
Way to go, Diane.
You guys want to go out there now and face me?
Any of you.
Get a bat.
First person that gets a hit off me, I'll give them the bar.
Any takers?
I thought that would shut you up, you gutless wonders.
Why don't you go over to the Playboy Club and hang out with the losing team?
Coach, I'm going to be in the back room alone.
Good, Diane's here.
Sam, you are an attractive man.
You have many friends.
You have a lot going for you.
But you have one miserable character flaw.
Gee, I wonder if I could coax you into telling me what that is.
You and I dated for what seemed an eternity and I think I know you pretty well.
You get into a contest and you'd rather die than lose.
I'm surmising, but a fear of losing drove you to drink and ruined your career.
I'll tell you something and then I'd appreciate it if you leave.
A little competitiveness is a healthy thing.
But you have more than a little competitiveness.
Sam, you're very sick.
- I am not.
- Yes, you are and I can prove it.
Why did you play this game?
To impress a bevy of buxom Bunnies, who now will never speak to you again.
You wanted to beat them more than you wanted to bed them.
My God, I am sick.
You're not sick.
You just have a problem.
I know.
I've always had it.
You approached games in this same way when you were a child?
Especially when I was a child.
My parents were kind of tough on me.
I couldn't please them.
If I got a C in school, they said, "Why not a B"?
- If I got a B, "Why didn't you get an A"?
- And if you got an A?
Sorry.
You know, in high school once I pitched a two-hitter.
All my dad could talk about were the lousy two damn hits.
Sam, this is wonderful.
You're sharing an attempt to confront the roots of your self-involvement.
I had no idea you could relate on this level.
Yeah, it kind of feels good to open up like this.
When I was about six I made my dad breakfast in bed on Father's Day.
I was really proud of myself.
All he could say was the eggs were too dry and the toast was too light.
Sam, I'm feeling a closeness to you now that compels me to share a core feeling of my own, something which I have yet to make privy to my analyst.
It happened my 17th summer If I'd made the toast any darker, he would have said I burned it.
I was brimming with the innocence of youth Everybody else would have said, "That toast is fine.
" Stop with the damn toast tragedy.
- What's your problem?
- I'm trying to share something painful.
- And you keep cutting me off.
- I was talking about my dad.
I was going to tell you about the time I stayed home from the prom.
You interrupted my dad's story for that?
What more was there?
He didn't like your toast.
Fine.
Tell me all about your dance story.
Does this have anything to do with mice and glass slippers?
I assure you my prom story would make your story look like self-pitying tripe.
All right.
Right now I'm going to admit that I'm a very competitive person.
It just occurred to me why our relationship never worked.
You always had to have the last say.
You had to be on top and you're still doing it.
You are just as competitive as I am.
Me?
I'm not competitive.
I'm intense and strong-willed.
But I think that mindless games and contests are very destructive and diminish the human spirit.
Is that right?
Want to play Ping-Pong?
Of course I don't want to play Ping-Pong.
It's preposterous.
It's not exactly my best sport.
A lot of people beat me at it, but I bet I could beat you.
What if you did?
What would it prove?
That I'm having a great day, my dad was wrong, God's in His heaven and you are a loser.
As always, you are just trying to avoid the central issue here.
Come on, chicken.
Don't do this, Sam.
I've played Ping-Pong.
My father built me an elaborate rec room when I was a child.
My daddy liked me.
Yeah, I bet you got lots of practice staying home from all those proms.
Yes.
It gave me the opportunity to master the complexities of making toast.
Nice serve, Diane.
All right.
Yeah, you'll be easy.
I'm real worried.
And since that time, Norm, I've never feared death.
- My point!
- Lucky shot.
Come on, serve.
- What are we doing?
- It's called Ping-Pong.
Serve.
This all started out with us arguing over who is the most competitive.
What are we proving by knocking a ball all night?
It won't be all night.
I'm about to win.
Serve.
Let's start by admitting that we both have a problem.
Let's put down our paddles simultaneously and walk away from this.
You're quitting?
Is that it?
As it so happens, I am a point ahead.
I could win on this serve.
I am suggesting a greater triumph for us both.
A victory over this destructive problem we both have.
Let's beat our paddles into ploughshares, Sam.
Say again?
Try this for me and see if you don't feel better.
I'm putting down my paddle.
Join me in this victory, Sam.
- How do you feel?
- I feel OK.
- As a matter of fact, I feel pretty good.
- Good.
- Like to buy me a cup of coffee?
- You bet.
- How about that?
- Just one more thing.
- I win!
- You're not getting out of here alive.
- Don't be a sore loser.
- You'll be sore.
That's why they call those paddles.

{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
TEACHER'S PET Carla, might I have a word?
I know how you always like to poke fun at me and whatnot, but I'd appreciate it if you stayed away from one area I'm sensitive about.
- That is my ears.
- I don't make jokes about your ears.
Why would I make jokes about Oh, my God!
I never noticed those satellite dishes before.
I must have been distracted by the other atrocities attached to your head.
Just hear me out on this one, will you?
Last night I went through my insurance policy and I discovered that I'm eligible for an ear tuck.
It's going to be hard enough to go through without you razzing me.
So all I want to ask is that you please not make my life a living hell.
- This really means a lot to you.
- It's the most important thing in my life.
Well, go ahead.
Get it done.
We'll see.
One other thing, Carla.
Would you lay off about how I live with my mother?
Gee, you've got to give me something.
What am I going to tease you about?
I'm not the most tidy guy in the world.
Oh, OK.
I'll limit myself to that.
- Thank you, Carla.
- You're welcome.
Your mother called.
She said you left your earmuffs in the driveway and no one can get out.
That was a tidy tease.
Hey, everybody.
- What do you have there, Sam?
- Looks like books.
Yeah, I guess you could call them books.
Something I've been meaning to read.
Why don't you open one up so we can see the little gingerbread house pop out?
You wasted your money on that one, Sam.
You'll be disappointed with the ending.
I'll be in my office.
- He locked his door.
- We're trapped out here with you.
Sam never locks his door.
He's done that a few times this week.
He did it the other night, never made a sound.
Stayed till closing time.
My God.
The thing I feared worst has happened.
Your living bra died of boredom.
This is no time for levity.
I think Sam might be drinking again.
I was afraid of this.
Day after day of watching Frasier and me exulting in our joy has driven him over the edge.
Come on, Diane.
I doubt seriously if he's drinking.
There's lots of things he could be doing.
Like what?
Maybe he's reading just like he said.
It can't be that.
I was once with Sam when he was reading.
I'd recognise the sounds anywhere.
Well, there's one way to ascertain whether he's drinking.
I will smell his breath.
- Go away.
- Sam, it's Diane.
Go far away.
Sam, there's something important I need to talk to you about.
- All right, come in.
- The door is locked.
I wonder how that happened.
- Hello, Sam.
- Hello.
What are you doing?
Why are you sniffing like that?
- What's that?
- I told you, I had a book.
"The World And Its People.
" This is surprising, Sam.
The title doesn't contain the words naughty, hot, or throbbing?
- I told you, it's just a book I'm reading.
- It's not just a book.
It's a textbook.
- Are you back in school?
- Promise you won't tell anybody.
This is nothing to keep secret.
This is wonderful.
Why are you concealing it?
It's a little embarrassing.
A guy my age going back to school.
It's not embarrassing!
It's noble and fine and it's inspirational.
Let's tell everyone!
No, come on.
You know how the guys make fun of me.
Sam, no one enjoys teasing you more than I do and I refrained.
That's true.
All right, what the hey, let's do it.
- I'm so proud of you.
- Thank you.
- Unless - Unless what?
Sam, you're not doing this to impress me and win me back, are you?
- No, I'm doing it for my diploma.
- I hope so.
If this is part of some involved scheme to get me back in bed with you, you will be very disappointed.
Yeah, but you'll enjoy yourself.
Attention, everyone.
I have an announcement to make.
Someone in Cheers is improving himself and I want you all to know about it.
I knew it.
Carla, you told Diane about my ear job, didn't you?
Clifford, Carla didn't tell me anything.
Well, you were saying?
After a rather lengthy interruption, Sam has decided to go back to school and pursue his degree.
- You're getting your ears done, man?
- Where's your sense of humour.
- It was a joke.
- Will you forget about that?
This is exciting news.
Our Sammy is going to attain his Bachelor of what?
- Art?
Sciences?
- High school.
- His Bachelor High school.
What?
- I never graduated from high school.
In my senior year I got a contract to play Class A ball.
Spring training didn't start until February and school didn't get out until June.
High school.
I always promised my parents I'd go back and finish.
She was a lot happier about this in the other room.
I spent a year of my life being defiled by Dobie Gillis.
I'm terribly sorry.
I just assumed you meant college.
- I plan to go to college, too.
- Good.
Let me know when you get there so I can leave the house without a veil.
Sam, why does a guy like you want to go back to high school?
You got everything a man could want and you dumped the one thing no man wants.
I'm tired of being embarrassed about being a dropout.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
A lot of famous people never graduated.
Name three.
According to "The Book Of Lists", Thomas Edison, Noël Coward.
Cher never graduated.
- Cher?
- Absolutely.
Never finished, Coach.
- I feel a lot better now.
- Why?
You never finished either?
No, I was missing a couple of those what-d'- you-ma-call-its?
- Units?
- No, years, Diane.
Do you think it would be a good idea if I was going back to school?
I think it's a wonderful idea.
The two of you can go together.
Coach can make up classes he missed.
What do you think?
I'll have my hands full getting me through.
It'll be fun.
You'll have someone to study with.
Coach, I'm just taking geography.
It's the last thing I have to complete so I can get my diploma.
Sam, it would only be a start for me, you know.
As a matter of fact, as I remember it now I was very good in geography.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Or was it geometry?
Diane, give me a question in geometry.
What is the sum of the angles in an isosceles triangle?
It was geography.
- Hey, everybody.
- Clifford.
Diane.
Well, take your last look at a flawed Clifford.
Tomorrow I go under the knife.
Why don't you just go under the bus?
I'm talking about my operation, Carla.
I'm going to have my ears tucked back.
Save money Put chewing gum behind them.
That doesn't work.
I mean that probably wouldn't work.
- Don't let me stop you.
You're on a roll.
- Those are the only words I know.
You guys seem to be in a good mood.
You noticed?
We did great on our test tonight.
You both passed?
Passed?
We both got A's again.
Once again we got the two highest grades in the class.
Are we going to study together tonight?
Listen, this exam's going to constitute - What have I told you all semester?
- Oh, I know, I know.
Studying is for saps.
That's right.
I'll be in my office.
- What was the test about, Sam?
- I don't know.
I forget.
Wait a minute.
You got an A on this test and you don't know what it covered?
After a quiz, I like to empty out my head.
How?
By blowing your nose?
I got an A, didn't I?
Coach, I am so impressed with you.
Thank you, Diane.
- Sam didn't retain much from the test.
- Yeah, but he does just great.
I never realised what a brain he is.
I study all the time.
He sleeps in the classroom.
He never takes a note.
And still he gets the great grades.
No wonder he's Miss Purdy's favourite.
- Miss Purdy?
- Yeah, our beautiful school teacher.
And Sam is her favourite?
Well, I can't say that.
But Sam's the only one I ever saw her kiss.
- They kiss?
- Yeah, I saw them in the parking lot.
I was putting up a notice there on the bulletin board.
With probing tongues?
No, Diane, with a thumbtack and my thumb.
I can't believe he's sunk to these depths.
I curse the day I walked into this bar.
Then it's unanimous.
Sam Malone, this is absolutely - The worst thing I've ever done.
- The worst thing Wait a minute.
You don't know what I'm going to say.
I found out you have been - Sleeping with my teacher.
- That's right.
That's not the worst part.
She also has been giving you - Good marks because of it.
- Yes.
Are you admitting that you know it's wrong?
- Yeah, that's right.
- Yeah?
Well, stop slouching.
Look what's happened to your posture.
- What?
- I needed something.
Gee the whole thing started so innocently.
I began dating her because she was cute and because we hit it off.
I had no idea that I was going to get better marks because of it.
I just was after some meaningless sex and it's turned into something sleazy.
You know the old saying, "The best laid plans of mice and scum " Yeah, boy, ain't that the truth?
I didn't realise anything was wrong until I got these quizzes back.
Instead of marking off wrong answers, she'd say, "Close enough.
A plus.
" It's a sad commentary on our educational system when a harlot is allowed in the public schools.
If I remember correctly, when we met you were dating your professor.
For your information, I was a legitimate A student in the classroom.
I never got good grades in the sack.
Don't worry.
I always gave you an E for effort.
I'm going to tell you what you have to do.
You won't like it, but you have to Call Miss Purdy and tell her I want an honest grade.
Sit up straight!
I can't do that, Diane.
I'm not prepared to take the exam.
Well, Coach will help you.
Sam, you started out with such noble intentions.
I hate to see you end up like this.
Yeah, I know you're right.
Right after I take the exam, then I'll call her.
Come on Maybe with Coach's help, I can get by.
Hello, Miss Purdy?
It's little Sammy Malone from the third row.
Yeah, listen, Alana, about school, I had this crazy thought.
I'm even embarrassed to mention it.
Is our relationship in any way affecting the marks I've been getting?
Like making you unconsciously change some of What?
You are?
Well, that's nice, but Me?
Yeah, I'm naked, too.
Sounds like we're ready for the class photo.
No, there's no one here.
It was an insect, but I killed it.
Listen, I'm serious about this.
I would like my grade to be based on my knowledge of geography.
No, I mean it.
Did I say something funny?
When you see the results of my tests, you're going to be laughing out the other side of your hemisphere.
Excuse me, I've got studying to do.
Is there anything in particular I should cram?
All right, but remember, I gave you that one as a going-away present.
Boy, that lady has got a mean mouth on her for a 73-year-old.
I was joking, I was joking!
Hey, Coach!
- Where's Coach?
- He's in the back, Sam.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
I've got to study for this exam.
It's important.
- I'd be happy to help you study, Sam.
- I'd be proud to assist.
Are you kidding me?
You can't help me.
You know squat about geography.
Coach, could you help me study?
We've got to start studying now.
I thought you didn't need anybody.
He does now.
While you were earning your grades with hard work, Sam earnt his by dating the teacher.
Is that true, Sam?
Yeah, but I've wiped the slate clean, Coach.
Whatever I get now, I have to earn, so please help me cram.
You mean all semester long, I've been wearing my buns to the bone while you've been polishing the teacher's apple?
Come on, Coach.
I want to get my diploma.
You know that whatever I get in this exam is my grade for the class.
Find yourself another sap to study with.
- Come on, Coach.
- No way.
I'm going.
Oh, my God, I need help.
Carla, what do you know about geography?
I know what creek you're up.
Hey, guys, would you help me study for this quiz?
Maybe you could just go over the facts with me or something?
I'm sorry, Sam.
I think we're too dumb to help.
Don't you, Norm?
I didn't even understand the question, Cliffie.
I want to go home, I think.
- I'll go home.
- Yeah, left.
Right.
Left.
Right.
Left.
Right.
- I can't even do that.
- Let's go home, Norm.
I guess that just leaves you and me, huh?
Oh, dear, Sam.
This is a problem.
Frasier and I have tickets for a piece of experimental theatre tonight.
I feel obligated to go because the last act takes place in Frasier's living room.
- I'd hate to have you miss that.
- If you want me to cancel out, I will.
No, it's too late.
You can't help me.
I'm going to fail this exam.
I wonder if Miss Purdy's still naked.
No OK, Sam, I'll help you.
You always mess up and I always bail you out.
You mess it up and I bail you out.
It's getting a little boring.
- I'm telling you.
- Thanks, Coach.
- Don't you think it's getting boring?
- Yes, Coach.
The only thing I can say is that Sam's lucky to have such a forgiving friend.
- Thank you.
- Good night.
You can learn about anything in this world if you just follow my little trick.
Got it?
Albania.
Here, Albania.
Or - should we say Albania?
- Why did you say it like that?
We learn our facts by associating countries with music.
Why?
- Do you want to study alone?
- No.
One, two, three Albania, Albania You border on the Adriatic Your land is mostly mountainous And your chief export is chrome You're a communist republic, You're a red regime Sing it, Sam.
Ready?
Albania, Albania You border on the Adriatic Cliffie, I thought you were getting your ears done today.
I decided this is the way God made me.
Who am I to question His judgement?
You were wrong about the insurance company covering it?
Mostly that.
Taiwan, Taiwan on the sea That China Sea Listen up, everybody!
I got an A in the tests and the best grades in the class.
- How did you do, Sam?
- I got nosed out by Coach.
I got a D. Ladies and gentlemen, Sam Malone is now a high school graduate.
- Congratulations.
- For what?
- You passed.
- Yeah, a D as in dumb.
A D as in diploma.
An honest D is better than a tainted A. Boy, I tell you, I may have my diploma, but I sure feel dumber than ever.
I studied myself hoarse for that exam and still I got a D. Sam, you only had one night to study.
It makes no difference.
My brain doesn't work like yours.
I can't learn things.
Sam, some people may be better students than others, but you have street smart, savvy - Common sense.
- That's right.
Just because you can't remember Pierre is the capital of North Dakota doesn't mean that you should feel - Wait a minute.
Say that again.
- What?
- The capital of North Dakota.
- Pierre.
No, it isn't.
It's Bismarck.
Pierre, South Da What difference does it make?
- The point is you have earned your - Pierre?
I can't believe this.
North Dakota, Pierre?
Hey, listen to this for a second.
Go on, tell them.
I was just making an illustration.
What's the capital of North Dakota?
- Easy.
Bismarck.
- She thinks it's Pierre.
All right, I may have inadvertently switched the two.
- Oregon.
Give me the capital of Oregon.
- Portland.
- No, it isn't.
It's Eugene.
- I knew that.
- It just slipped my mind.
- It isn't Eugene.
It's Salem.
Do you believe this?
Ignorance is bliss.
This is Eden.

BEHIND EVERY GREAT MAN Delicious, Sammy.
Fortunately, I've saved room for another.
Gentlemen, the keg is dry.
A new keg coming out, gents.
We'll miss you.
Do we have to do this every time?
We don't have to, it's an honour and a privilege.
The keg is dead.
Long live the keg.
Norm?
Normie, are you OK?
Oh, Cliffie, I swore it wouldn't get to me this time.
I got a letter from Coach.
He's in Ohio.
- Why Ohio?
- Family reunion.
There's some pictures of him with everybody.
- Let me see.
- That's a very attractive family.
But why is everybody but the Coach black?
That's not his family.
He was sent an invitation by mistake.
He didn't want to hurt anybody's feelings by not showing up.
Looks like they've accepted him.
Are you kidding?
He's been going for the last six or seven years.
In fact, next year they're going to have it at his place.
It says here, "Send my love to everybody at Cheers.
" Then he signs it "Uncle Whitey".
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!
- What would you like, Norm?
- A reason to live.
Keep them coming.
- You look a little peaky there, my friend.
- I'll be OK once my dinner settles in.
- You ate at the Hungry Heifer again?
- Yes.
The place is all right.
I just didn't order the right thing.
- I couldn't resist the muscles.
- I love seafood.
No, he's a big burly waiter, makes you shut up and eat.
- Va-va-va-voom, eh, Norm?
- I beg your pardon?
Hot babe at twelve o'clock.
I think it's the next notch on my bedpost.
The only notches on your bedpost come from banging your head in frustration.
- Coming this way.
- I pity you married guys.
- Hi, I'm Paula Nelson.
- Norm Peterson.
Hi - This smooth talker is Cliff Clavin.
- Hello, Cliff.
May I buy you and your immigrant friend a beer?
- Absolutely.
- Two beers, please.
I'm a reporter for "Boston Scene" magazine.
I'm looking for information on the singles scene in Boston.
- Have you met many women at Cheers?
- No.
I haven't had much success, but how can I compete with Cary Grant over there?
I notice you're not writing.
Don't waste your time with these two geldings.
Beat it!
Real smooth, Cliffie.
It's a good thing she identified herself as a reporter.
Otherwise, she would be Doctor Feelgood's next patient.
Cliff, how long did it take you to create this little world you live in?
If you really want the low-down on the singles scene, talk to the owner of the bar, Sam Malone.
He'll give you all the information you need and make you breakfast the next morning.
I've heard every pick-up line imaginable.
I doubt your Mr Malone has anything but a quote that would help me.
Well, la-di-dah.
Hey, good-looking, what have you got cooking?
- You must be Sam Malone.
- The one and only.
- Who are you?
Do you like Italian food?
- I'm Paula Nelson.
Hi, Paula.
Hi.
I'm writing an article on singles bars for "Boston Scene" magazine.
What is the major allure of this bar for the singles crowd?
You're gazing hungrily at him, honey.
You're unbelievable.
- I think he's got a whiff on this one.
- Not in a million years.
Would you say "Cheers" is known as a singles bar?
I'll answer that question seriously if you'll answer one of mine seriously.
OK.
Do you think it's possible for a man to satisfy a woman too much?
In my two weeks of research, you're the first man to hit on me so relentlessly I've ended the interview.
- You should have come to me first.
- Excuse me.
- You're not leaving, are you?
- Sam, dig it out.
Come on, you can do it, babe.
You don't really think I meant those juvenile come-ons, do you?
- Why wouldn't I?
- Hey, you did!
She did!
No, I was just giving you examples of the stupid things guys say here to pick up women.
- It's sad.
- Yeah.
Well, be that as it may Wait.
It'd be fun to help you.
- You're looking for a quote?
- Don't waste my time.
I always say, if it wasn't for people who say they never go to singles bars, singles bars would be out of business.
Didn't Diane say that?
When you talk all the time, you're bound to say everything eventually.
- That's almost useable.
- There's more.
Why don't we go up to Melville's?
I'll share my thoughts on singles bars and we'll have some bouillabaisse.
Is this another come-on?
You're plying me with fish heads?
No, no, I promise.
We'll just talk about the article.
OK?
- I do love bouillabaisse - I hear it's an aphrodisiac.
But when I'm around, even oxygen is an aphrodisiac.
I can't believe you're not writing down these crude come-ons.
Probably the hardest part of my job is the daily encounter with loneliness Sammy!
Put it there, Cliffie!
- We're number one!
- Number one!
Guys?
Do you remember anything Diane said about Impressionism?
No, but I know she makes a bad first one.
- After that, it gets worse.
- Why are you asking, Sam?
I found out Paula likes French Impressionists, so I've got to find some smart things to say.
Yeah, she's an art buff and I'm a Paula-in-the-buff buff.
Give up on this one, Sammy.
I'm doing fine.
We've had two dates, as long as I keep throwing out Dianeisms, there's no problem.
Haven't you had your fill of dames like that?
I thought that disaster with Diane would have soured you on brainy women.
Or women.
Or life.
- Listen, I want that woman, Carla.
OK?
- What's so special about this woman?
Well, if you must know, it's kind of embarrassing to admit, but I've never had a reporter before.
- Get out.
- Well, never a magazine reporter from the Boston area with a circulation of over a million - Yeah, go on.
- lately.
What's special about this one?
I don't get it.
I understand it.
He wants the ones he can't have.
Like this dame and me.
Can't anybody think of something Diane said about painters?
She's out of your league, Sammy.
Face it, you're just one of us, one of the great unwashed.
Excuse me, Sam?
I was all too brief in my response to your inquiry about Cézanne.
Backgrounds were very important to him, even in his early period.
Eventually however, he completely broke with Renaissance perspective.
That makes sense.
Thank you very much.
But that's not the reason his paintings looked, as you so eloquently put it, "like he was goofed on skunk weed.
" - You know what I was talking about.
- I'm not putting you down.
I think your new-found interest in the arts is completely laudable.
And I'd like to think that I had something to do with it.
You did.
- Keep it up, big lug.
- Thank you.
Background Important Renaissance.
A- I-S-S-A-N-C-E - Perspective.
- Give up, cucumber brain.
Hey, Sam, you have got a textbook.
What are you asking Diane for?
It's more fun to steal than study.
Anyway, it's a hot irony to use Diane's brain to get another woman's body.
I'll be in my office, studying.
Diane, how about those pointillists?
Oh I think Seurat was the finest naturalist of his time.
You and me both, sister.
Diane, I'm off to the fetish seminar.
I was hoping for a rapprochement before I go out of town.
Frasier, I thought I had seen you at your lowest last night when you waited until the kiwi tarts and the demitasse to announce you were going to yet another seminar.
This is the most demanding relationship I've ever been in.
Diane, am I pronouncing this right?
Giv-er-ny?
- Giverny.
- Thank you.
Every time we have a discussion, it turns into What was that all about?
Sam is developing an interest in the Impressionists.
- Hmm, what?
- Hmm, this is suspicious.
I think it's part of Sam's grand design to win you back.
Not this again.
You sound like a broken record.
Now you're saying I repeat myself.
That I say things over and over.
You do repeat yourself on this subject.
And it's very cynical of you not to believe that Sam is developing a genuine appreciation for culture.
I'm sorry, Diane, just one more art question here.
- What is it, Sam?
- All right.
Excuse me.
Now, this Rubens guy.
Is this the same guy that invented that sandwich?
- No, I don't think so.
- OK.
I was just wondering.
The women in his paintings look like they really tuck away the groceries.
He'll be a curator in no time.
I hate that attitude!
It's obviously futile to try to talk to you in this mood.
This is the number to call me, should you be interested in rational discourse.
You'll rue the day you did that!
Oh, Frasier!
Diane Oh, damn.
Carla, do you remember if Diane said anything about Renoir's "Bather Seated on a Rock"?
Would you give up on that egghead?
It didn't work before, it won't now.
I was different before, this time I'll do it right.
You really think it's worth all this trouble?
Ever since that woman walked in the door, I've wanted her.
I won't give up just because she thinks she's smarter.
- I don't like her.
- That's quite clear, but it won't stop me.
He wants me.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Sam, if there's anything else I can do to further stimulate and arouse your interest in the arts, let me know.
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.
I'm so moved by your hunger for knowledge.
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!
Afternoon, everybody.
So how was your meal at the Hungry Heifer?
Cliff was fussy at first, but I think I converted him.
- Really?
- Well, yeah, my steak was a little gristly, but what do you expect when they've got a mural of the Heimlich manoeuvre?
Carla, take the bar for a minute, I have an important call to make.
Cliffie had the Ton O'T-Bone.
For less than four bucks you get - No, you mean beef.
- Don't be ridiculous, that stuff is beff.
It's a Hungry Heifer trademark for a processed, synthetic, meat-like substance.
- Oh, no.
- What do you expect for four bucks?
See me complain about the loobster?
Hi, this is Sam Malone.
You remember me, do you?
Well, that's great.
I'd like to make a reservation for tomorrow night, but I want a particular room.
Do you remember I was there with a slender blonde who was mad about me?
Yeah, I want the same room.
It had a fireplace and a deck and a hot tub.
That's it.
I'd like to have that one, please.
Yeah, I'm hoping it'll create the same old magic.
Yeah.
Thank you, I'll see you tomorrow night.
Bye.
Sammy, I hate to cast a shadow over your good time, but who will make drinks tomorrow while you're making whoopee?
Damn.
I didn't think about that.
- You can handle the bar, can't you?
- Give up waiting on tables?
I get my heaviest tips in my third trimester.
You think Diane's ready to handle this by herself?
What?
She's a worse bartender than she is a waitress.
When you made her do it for a couple of hours, she hated it.
Well, I'll just have to ask her nice.
- Well, good luck.
And good night.
- Yeah, good night.
Well, Sam, I guess I'll be going home, unless there's something you'd like to talk to me about, now we're almost alone and we have a private moment.
Actually, there is something I'd like to ask you.
Ask away.
You've been acting kind of strange today.
Is there?
Well, I've had something on my mind.
Well, yeah, me, too.
This will be pretty tough to ask you.
Sam?
If it makes it any easier, I know what you're going to ask.
- You do?
- Yes.
I overheard your conversation, I couldn't help it.
You're going to ask about this weekend, aren't you?
Yeah, I know the first time we tried this, it didn't turn out too hot, but I'll take full responsibility for that.
Well, I'm sure that I was at fault, too.
Whatever.
I think the important thing is that it'll be better this time, now you know where everything is.
Well, I suppose that's true.
Yeah, I'll tell you what.
If you like this weekend, maybe we can make it permanent.
What do you say?
Permanent?
Is that you want, Sam?
I'm not making any promises.
Let's just see how the weekend goes, OK?
- Is three o'clock OK?
I already booked.
- I know.
Sam, I'm just overwhelmed.
Oh, come on.
You don't have to be nervous.
After your first few drinks, you'll relax, and I think you'll actually enjoy it.
Well, it does seem to help.
- Sam!
- What?
Everything's going so fast.
My mind is a tumult.
I feel like we're on a runaway train.
Where will it end?
- I've got to think about this.
I'm sorry.
- You really are taking this seriously.
Don't worry, if you break anything, I'm fully insured.
- Excuse me.
- My fault.
- You take it.
- No, you.
Thank you.
- Nice day for a trip.
- Yes, isn't it?
- Where are you off to, uh - Paula.
Diane.
I'm going away with a gentleman for the weekend.
This is a coincidence, so am I. - And you're meeting him here?
- Yes.
Me, too.
- Small world, huh?
- Yeah.
It's my first weekend with this guy and I just hope I'm not making a big mistake.
He's got me puzzled.
I start to think he's a dumb jerk and then he says something intelligent.
Well, I'm lucky, I know mine's a dumb jerk.
But we have something that just won't die.
Kinda like crab grass.
That's a lovely thought.
I know I may be making the biggest mistake of my life.
- I'm seeing an eminent psychiatrist.
- So am I. Is it helping you?
- No, I mean romantically.
- Oh.
And I may be giving all of that up just to rekindle a mostly physical relationship whose only appeal may be its danger.
- Where are you going with this guy?
- To an inn on the coast of Maine.
This is amazing.
- You don't mean - Yes.
- Hey, Paula.
- Sam!
- It's good to see you.
- You, too.
- Ready for a trip down ecstasy lane?
- Yes, I think so.
- Diane, how are you doing?
- Fine, great, great.
- Really well.
- Will you be all right here by yourself?
You bet.
You two just go off and have nice time.
OK.
Thank you.
If you run into any problem, Carla knows where to reach me.
- I appreciate this.
- Bye, Diane.
What's with the suitcase?
That's not my suitcase.
Who said it was my suitcase?
No, no.
- It looks like yours.
- There are a million of these around.
No, this one belongs to this gentleman.
Sir?
Really.
Now don't leave this lying around.
Anybody could just walk right off with it.
It'll never happen again.
- Well, have fun, Sam.
- Yes Thank you, I will.
You!
That's the most fun I've had since 1958.

{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
BAR BET - Chekhov.
- No, Norm, it was Ibsen.
It was Chekhov It was "The Cherry Orchard.
" You're full of it.
It was Ibsen, "The Master Builder.
" - It was Chekhov.
- Ibsen, Ibsen, Ibsen.
- Chekhov, Chekhov - Ibsen!
Excuse me.
I don't mean to stop you, but you are talking about Anton Chekhov and Henrik Ibsen?
Of course we're talking about Anton Chekhov and Henrik Ibsen.
This is wonderful!
Perhaps I might be of some assistance.
I would love to contribute to your literary enquiry.
- I suppose she can help?
- Please, please.
- If anybody can, you can.
- I'd like to think so.
OK, what were you watching on TV that night when Norm gorged on cheese doodles and whistled "The Way We Were"?
Ibsen.
And it was taco chips.
- Pay up.
Let's go.
- All right.
I guess it was Chekhov and cheese doodles the night Artie tried to comb his hair with his feet.
Yeah, you're on thin ice arguing the classics with me.
- Hey, Sammy, long time.
- How have you been?
- About the same.
You?
- I never change.
- What'll you have?
- My usual.
You still drinking that stuff?
- Who is that guy?
- I don't know.
He's your friend.
I don't know him.
You guys?
He's never been here before.
I'm very good at placing faces.
Yeah?
Then place yours where we can't see it.
- I wish Coach were here, he'd know.
- Where is he?
He went to get his driver's licence renewed, he'll be back next week.
- Why so long?
- He went to Vermont.
He heard the test was easier there.
Why don't you just ask him his name?
Better a minute of embarrassment than look a fool.
No, it'd be too easy.
I can handle this.
You know how good I am at thinking on my feet.
I've seen you add and subtract on them.
- Subtraction must kinda hurt?
- Watch and learn.
Instead of your usual, I thought you might like a Manhattan.
- Manhattan is my usual.
- Gotcha!
- How's work?
- Fine.
You still work in the same place?
It had a real funny name - My house.
- Right!
I still get a kick out of that.
I'm still working the same crummy job, stuffing envelopes, but I'm glad you find that funny.
I didn't mean funny in the humorous sense.
I meant funny more in the Who the hell are you?
- I'm Eddie Gordon.
- Eddie Eddie Gordon?
I don't know who he is.
A year ago, you bet me your bar you could marry Jacqueline Bisset - by midnight tomorrow.
- Come on, who the hell would Oh, Eddie Gordon.
Jeez, how the hell are you, Eddie?
- Is it coming back to you, Sam?
- Yeah.
I'm a little hazy, I had a few too many that night.
- You had a lot too many that night.
- I was going through a rough period.
How are you and Jackie getting along?
You didn't invite me to the wedding.
I must have been drinking tequila.
I always want Jacqueline Bisset when I drink tequila.
But I bet you don't always write it down, signing your name in front of witnesses.
- I did that, too?
- Yeah.
Keep it, it's a copy.
Listen, this was obviously a joke, Eddie.
I'm no expert, but I know a little bit about the law and this sounds like a crock.
You'll never own this bar.
When I take over, I'm thinking of serving free chicken wings.
Sorry, Sam, the law's the law.
What do you say to those little meatballs, get a Sterno flame - Eddie, as a drinking partner, you stink!
- I'm sorry you feel that way, Sam.
I'll see you tomorrow at midnight, when the bar becomes mine.
You've thought about serving crab puffs?
Melvilles does them in mustard sauce.
If you're serious about this, you don't have a leg to stand on.
Most snakes don't.
We'll find out in court.
My attorney's looked it over, he says we've got a shot.
Don't get upset, you'll still have your job.
I'm going to need a bartender.
You actually went out drinking with that man?
That's not the worst.
I picked up the bill.
- This has to be a joke, doesn't it?
- Let an attorney take a look at that.
You know of one, or did you finally pass your bar exam using the pity clause?
When I pass my bar exam, Cliff, you're going to eat your words.
Yeah, if I got any teeth left.
What do you think, Mr Witless for the prosecution?
It seems you signed an agreement with Eddie which may or may not be binding.
Tom, knock off the legalese.
Talk to us in a language we can understand.
Trust me, Sam, this thing won't hold up.
You were drunk, right?
It's not a contract, it's a wager.
You'll win this case easy.
Tom's right.
Let Eddie press his case.
We'll get a good lawyer and make a monkey out of him.
- Oh, boy, oh - What?
What's wrong?
If you don't trust Tom, get a second opinion.
No, it's not that.
I can't let Eddie take me to court.
Why?
I'd have to testify that I was drunk and made an idiot out of myself.
You're worried about the publicity?
The press wasn't exactly kind to me when I drank myself out of baseball.
I'd almost rather lose the bar than be humiliated again.
Oh, Sam.
Quit acting human, it confuses me.
I don't suppose you could marry her?
Yeah.
Find, meet, woo Jacqueline Bisset in two days?
It'd take at least a week.
- You kidding?
Five working days, tops.
- Wait, I've got an idea.
You've actually conceived something besides a child?
A bitter and unprovoked attack.
- I like it.
- What have you got?
Sam, this doesn't say anything about having to marry Jacqueline Bisset, the movie actress.
There's got to be more than one Jacqueline Bisset.
Marry one, win the bet and get a quick divorce.
Eddie won't be able to say a thing.
All I have to do is find another Jacqueline Bisset and marry her?
- It can't be that simple.
- Sam Hush, hush, I'm thinking.
Someone note the date and the time.
We've got to call information all over the country.
I think I can help you out there.
I have the phone books of every major city in the country.
- Why?
- I just collect phone book cover art.
One of those.
This'll be fun.
We'll find anybody called Bisset, ask if they have a relative named Jacqueline and get them to come here.
- Are you with me?
- Yeah!
- So much for the Sun Belt.
- Norm!
You Philistine, you just put a fold in "Sunrise Over Albuquerque".
Hey, boys I'd expect there'd be a few Jacqueline Bissets.
It can't be that uncommon.
I got a Jacqueline Bisset on the phone.
- Paydirt!
- She sounds sweet, but there's a catch.
She's 93, she lives in a rest home in Maine.
- So is she married?
- I didn't ask.
Are you married?
Got a 94-year-old husband, been married 73 years.
Happy years?
I just talked to a man in Green Bank, West Virginia, with a grand-daughter named Jacqueline Bisset, 25-years-old and unmarried.
- Let me talk to her.
- I already did.
Jackie will be here tomorrow morning.
- How did you do it?
- A little ingenuity.
I told her she'd won a trip to Boston in a radio game show.
- Just convince her to marry you.
- I could kiss you.
Yeah, you can.
But I warn you, you're not going to get anywhere.
- I offered prizes to induce her to come.
- That's OK, like what?
Free round-trip air fare, first class, suite at the Ritz, free historical tour, matched set of luggage.
- Why not offer her a car?
- I did, but she took the cash instead.
Only kidding, Sammy.
The point is, she'll be here.
You're right, you're right.
My problems are over.
Aren't you forgetting one important step?
You still have to get her to marry you.
It's no problem.
As soon as I get her face-to-face, she'll fall under my spell.
- You killer.
- Sam, your vanity knows no bounds.
I guess I ought to wear my best outfit.
Diane, when you dream of me, what am I wearing?
An ant hill.
Congratulations, Coach.
All the weeks of cramming and drilling with your friends, it's all paid off.
We're proud of you.
All right.
Take care.
- Coach passed his driver's test?
- No, he found Vermont.
- When's your ex-wife-to-be to be here?
- She's supposed to be here now.
Cliff was meant to pick her up two hours ago.
- Are you ready?
- I don't know.
What do you think?
Yes!
Any girl would jump at the chance to marry you.
Sam, there is one problem, however.
I believe I detect a hint of fresh air coming through your cologne.
You're kidding.
I must have missed a couple of important pulse points.
Thank you.
This is "Cheers", Miss Bisset.
That's Sam Malone.
Well, he is good-looking.
The bad news is he talks.
- Miss Bisset, Sam Malone.
- Oh, boy, thank you for coming.
Cliff, set those bags down here.
Come and sit down by the bar.
Listen, did Cliff explain why we need you?
Yes, he did, and I'm not marrying anybody except in the usual way, where the groom isn't a total stranger.
I understand that, but this isn't like a real marriage.
It's just for a few hours, until I win a bet, then we'll get it annulled tomorrow.
Why not consider it a warm-up for the real thing?
I'm sorry, I'm just not interested.
I almost didn't make this trip when I thought it was a legitimate contest.
But I said to myself, "Jackie Bisset, nothing like this will happen again.
" So I kissed my dog, Smiley, and waved goodbye to my pa, and here I am.
Knock it off!
You don't talk like that.
Listen, I know this whole thing's been handled in a very stupid way.
But I really am in a jam here.
I tell you what, we promised you a guided tour, why don't I show you the sights, and I'll explain my whole story.
I know where to start, City Hall.
It's historic and we'll get a marriage licence.
- I really don't think so, no.
- Come on.
Why not?
You have a chance to help one of the greatest guys in the world.
- I barely know him.
- Let me fill you in.
Anybody here would do anything for this guy.
Right?
That's right.
Look, look.
Just hear him out, please, all right?
I never have been to Boston.
I always wanted to see it.
I tell you what, you tell me your story and I'll think about it.
You got a deal.
You'll love this, the Sam Malone pre-nuptial tour.
We'll start of with the USS Constitution, then we'll go to the Old North Church, Paul Revere's house, and then we'll top it off with the traditional Boston blood test.
- All those places are in Boston?
- Yes, Norman.
This town is a treasure-trove of historical monuments.
That's really something.
Thousands of people flock to Boston to see all those sights, and soak up a lot of American heritage, and I sit here in a bar, night after night, guzzling beer.
- It's sad, isn't it?
- Yeah.
But, hey, no one's forcing them.
It's getting late.
Sammy must be having a hard time talking Jackie into it.
Yes, and if he doesn't get back in a year, his cologne will wear off.
I don't know why he's going to this trouble.
I discussed this case with my law professor.
Was that before he scratched himself and ate a banana?
Are you calling him an ape?
You know something, one of these days I'm going to I don't know what.
That man would be magnificent in front of a jury.
Sam, thank you so much.
That was the most fun day of my whole life.
I'm glad you enjoyed it.
Sit down, I'll make you a cup of tea.
Boston is such a lovely city.
When we were on the Constitution, somebody recognised Sam.
I didn't know he was a celebrity.
Cut the chit chat.
Is Mammy Yokum going to marry you or not?
Well, she hasn't decided.
- What do you say, Jackie?
- I don't know.
Sam, I always thought my wedding day would be beautiful and special.
It will be.
We'll get a minister and have it right here.
You think that's beautiful and special?
Maybe you're asking the wrong guy.
It's quarter to twelve, I don't have much time.
Either you say yes now or I'll have to think of something else.
And he's already thought once today.
- This is all happening so fast.
- Fast?
It's been eight hours.
By the time I knew my ex-husband that long, he'd already cheated on me.
Well I was always raised to believe you should help people when you can.
I'm getting married!
Do you mind if I call home first?
I'd like to tell my pa about it.
Sure, come into my office here.
And don't forget to tell Billy-Joe-Bob-Jim.
Don't take too long, we don't have much time.
Oh, boy.
- Sam, I have dire news.
- Good or bad?
That was Justice Fiedler's secretary.
He's running a little late.
- What has he got to do?
- Well, his wife is having a baby.
So?
His work was finished a long time ago.
I'm sorry, but what do I do now?
We don't have time to call someone else.
It's not as though we have Justices of the Peace and ministers in here.
Don't be too sure, my son.
- You, Norman?
- Yeah.
In the '50s I sent a dollar to a church advertising in "Rolling Stone".
I'm an official minister of the Church of the Living Desert.
- Did you want to get out of the draft?
- No, we were just goofing around.
We were at the accounting club, getting high smelling adding machine ribbons.
It seemed funny, I don't know.
In that mindless state even this business used to seem funny.
- It reminded me of something else.
- Hello.
Oh, Justice Fiedler!
- Thank you so much for coming.
- Sorry I'm late, I just became a father.
We're all thrilled now get your buns over here.
We only have a few minutes.
- Carla, stay out of this.
- Here's your pulpit.
We are in a hurry.
Could you do this quickly?
Yes, I see there's a certain urgency.
By the way, it's a boy.
Nine pounds!
Just what the world needed.
- Hello, everybody.
- You're just in time, Eddie, for my wedding to Jacqueline Bisset.
- Don't make me laugh.
- Come here.
- See her, the girl on the phone?
- Wow, Jacqueline Bisset.
What happened to her?
It's not the movie star, Eddie.
The bet was Jacqueline Bisset and that's her name.
She's got ID to prove it.
- What is this, a trick?
- No, he's winning the bet.
Why don't you call Sam the winner and forget the whole thing?
- You're going to marry her?
- You bet.
- This is JP Fiedler.
- Yes, and father of the miracle baby.
Give it a rest, will you?
I don't know if it's necessary for you to go to all this trouble.
- Are you calling the bet off?
- No, he has an arrangement in mind.
That's right.
Maybe we can work out a settlement.
- That's what you've been after all along.
- Quiet, blondie!
Yeah.
This is between us men of the world.
I'll consider dropping the whole matter for maybe five grand.
- You'll get nothing from me, Eddie.
- All right, Sam.
I'll consider it square if you give me and a date free drinks for life.
- No.
- Do it, Sam.
I'd like to see what would go out with him.
Besides me, I mean.
Well, he kinda grows on you.
- Free drinks for the rest of the year?
- No.
One on the house?
- Not a chance.
- Gee, come on, Sam.
How about one of those olives with the pimento in?
You think about this the next time you shoot your mouth off in some bar.
Drinks on the house!
You see, I always land on my feet.
Sometimes on somebody else's.
You've thought about what you've done to that girl?
- Which one?
- Jackie.
That's right, she still thinks we're getting married.
- She didn't want to do it anyway.
- Did you see the look on her face?
She's a simple girl from a rural environment who finds herself in the city being entertained by a slightly attractive semi-celebrity.
How could her head not be turned?
Yeah, maybe you're right.
You think I laid on the charm too thick?
Yes, but she's a farm girl, she's used to stepping around such things.
Sam, guess what?
I told my pa all about this, and he's a baseball fan and he remembers you, sort of.
That was the kind of player I was.
- Isn't that great?
- Yeah.
- Yeah!
Boy, this will be sticky.
- What are we waiting for?
You know Will you do this?
You're a little smarter than me.
I'm a lot smarter than you are.
This paper napkin is a little smarter.
- Jackie, there'll be no wedding today.
- What about the bet?
The bet was called off.
Sam gets to keep his bar.
- Oh Well, that's good.
- Yes.
Let's be honest.
Weren't you falling for Sam just a little?
- Sam?
No!
- Come on, he's a very attractive man.
Almost as attractive as he thinks he is.
He only stopped complementing himself once, to ask if I wanted to.
- I like you.
- I like you, too, Diane.
Say, you must see the girls Sam goes out with.
What sort of girl would fall for Sam?
Pathetic wretches.
It would have to be someone lacking in self-respect, as shallow as he is and as empty-headed.
Amen.
Is Diane making you feel a little bit better about what happened?
- Yes, she is.
- Good.
She'd be the one to understand.
You know, this little filly and I - More tea?
- Thank you.

{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
THE MAIL GOES TO JAIL So, Norm, any luck impregnating Vera?
I miss the old days when people asked me things like, "How are those Red Sox doing"?
Things like that.
Well, excuse me for caring.
I'm sorry, Larry, I'm just a little edgy.
You have to understand I've gone an entire month with sex.
Normie, Larry understands.
Don't you, Larry?
But you've been trying for a few weeks now and you've yet to strike paydirt.
Can I ask you a personal question?
Heaven forbid this conversation get personal now.
Have you been to a fertility specialist?
Yeah, we have, but I don't have a lot of faith in this guy.
He's got Vera sprinkling powdered rhinoceros horn on my morning cereal.
Does it make you feel more virile, Normie?
Not really, but every now and then I get this urge to charge a jeep.
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!
What would you say to a beer, Normie?
Daddy wuvs you.
- It's freezing.
- Didn't you hear?
We've given our appliances the winter off.
There's a blockage in the heating.
The furnace is working, but we're not getting hot air.
- What's Sammy going to do?
- I cannot believe this helplessness.
How about a little Yankee ingenuity?
If Cheers were burning, would you wait for Sam to get back?
No, Diane, cos I already taught them the fire drill.
We all file out in an orderly fashion after nailing your hair to the bar.
We don't usually see you this early.
I'm sick, Diane.
I must be coming down with something.
Thought I'd get some coffee here before I finish my route.
- No, Cliff, let me get you a nice brandy.
- No, Coach, I hope I'm never that ill.
That's one thing that'll never touch these lips.
There's something that wants to?
Alcohol.
I'm on duty, Carla.
Just a coffee, please, Coach.
I can do better than that for you.
Will somebody go upstairs to Melville's and get this man a bowl of hot soup?
What happened to the heat, Coach?
Some minor malfunction that no one here is skilled enough to attempt to fix.
Diane, I resent that.
I'm kind of a handy guy.
I'll have you know just the other day I changed one of them - What do you call them?
- A light bulb.
Why don't you just call in sick?
I could never do that.
It's a matter of principle with me.
I've got to be on the verge of death before I take sick leave.
You used it up to go to Florida.
You got a problem with that?
- Here you go, Cliffie.
- Thank you, Norm.
- How many letters you got left?
- I don't know.
Seven or eight.
- Boy, this tastes good.
- These are on my way home.
Let me drop these off for you.
I've got to go home anyway.
No, you're not trained.
You're not qualified.
Qualified?
You drop them in a slot.
A chimp could do it.
No way.
They did a study at the University of Michigan.
Chimps were 32% slower.
Yeah, they were better with customer relations and everything.
Clifford, he is offering to do you a favour out of friendship for your own good.
Sounds like you have two options.
Either let me deliver these or run the risk of non-delivery - I'll drop these off.
- Thank you, Normie.
In those envelopes are the dreams, hopes and fears of a nation.
Yeah, and several car-wash announcements.
Hey, everybody.
Oh, boy!
Holy cow!
What happened here?
It was warmer in the mountains and we were au natural.
- Coach, did you check the furnace?
- It's not the furnace.
It's that damn vent.
I called the repairman.
He's on his way over.
Good.
Bambi, it's up to you and me to generate a little heat for these folks.
Don't bother.
We'll just huddle around a three-watt light bulb.
Feisty little barmaid.
I took her in off the streets.
She's crude, but devoted.
I had a terrific time.
Thank you.
Thank you, Sam.
It was the best ski trip I ever had.
- Yeah.
Me, too.
- Did you find any time for skiing?
No, darn it.
Somebody stole our skis.
We had to spend the whole weekend in the lodge.
That's too bad.
But when we were leaving, they turned up in the rack on the roof of Sam's car.
Some kids must have stolen them for a joy-ski.
Disrespectful punks.
I've got to get going.
I have to be at BU in half an hour.
BU?
That's Boston University, isn't it, Bambi?
- That's right.
- Where the smart types hang out.
- What are you studying?
- I'm not studying.
I'm going to be part of a fraternity stunt.
Yeah, she's tutoring some of the boys.
- In a way.
See you later, Sam.
- You take care.
Well, I guess I better take a look at this air duct.
Sometimes the problem's over here.
Bambi?
Yeah, what's wrong with that?
Well, I suppose it's better than Dumbo or Goofy.
Not as appropriate, but Coach, can I have my flashlight, please?
You know, Sam I can't help but noticing that Bambi wasn't the same little deer that you left here with on Friday.
No, I got rid of Cindy.
We weren't compatible.
Really?
What was the problem there?
Dumb as a post.
With so much in common, I can't imagine why you two went awry.
No, I'm serious.
She wasn't my intellectual equal.
You should have said you're looking for an intellectual equal.
I could introduce you to something that's growing on my shower curtain.
Thank you, Diane, but I think I'll wait and see how Bambi works out.
I've done just about everything I know what to do.
You shined a flashlight on it.
Yeah, it usually works, too.
This one's really got me stumped.
Could somebody go up to Melville's and get me a little bit more soup?
Larry?
You're not doing anything important there.
- Yeah, all right.
- Good man.
- Thanks a lot.
- I suppose you want some crackers?
Well, those low-sodium kind, all right?
- What's he doing in my office?
- The guy is sick as a dog.
Coach, I'm not so bad now.
I could probably sit up at the bar there and let Larry bring dinner down to me.
- Cliff Clavin?
- Yeah, Officer.
What's the trouble?
- Do you know a Norm Peterson?
- Yeah.
What is it?
He's at the station.
We've arrested him for mail theft.
- You made a mistake.
- There's no mistake.
We caught him messing with mail boxes on your route.
He had a handful of letters.
He said he was delivering them for you.
- I asked him to.
- You asked him to?
Well, you're out of a job, fella.
Excuse me, Officer, you interrupted me before I finished.
I asked him to quit following me.
I had him pegged as a sociopath right away.
He's a frustrated mailman.
We call it postal envy.
Anything serious going to happen to this ne'er-do-well?
- Not serious enough.
- I rue the day they outlawed flogging.
Bleeding hearts.
How well do you know this guy?
We talk every now and then.
He's a portly guy, isn't he?
Full size.
What will happen to this Patterson fella?
- Peterson.
- Officer, I'm the owner of the bar here.
Sam Malone.
Is there a problem?
No.
Some guy tried to implicate this letter carrier in a mail theft on his route.
- Crazy.
- You're kidding me.
Mail theft?
Ridiculous.
I've known Cliff for years.
He wouldn't be involved in that.
You're a fine bartender.
You are one of Boston's finest.
Thanks.
We just had to check out the story.
And check it out you did.
The Federal government appreciates the cooperation of you local boys.
Let's hope our penal system can rehabilitate the wretch.
Thank you.
Can you believe that?
- Let's shoot some stick.
- Sure.
They arrested a guy on Cliff's route for mail theft.
- You want eight ball or straight pool?
- Norman was finishing your route.
- Clifford?
- What was that?
You mean they arrested Norm?
You didn't straighten the cop out?
It's a bit complicated.
Sam, do you want to break?
- Clifford, get back here.
- Isn't it obvious what I did here?
Yeah, it's obvious what you've done.
You've run your best friend Norm up the river.
We're in trouble here.
My job's hanging by a thread.
Norm's in jail anyway.
Just leave him there a little longer while I figure out what's the best thing to do.
- Norm will be OK.
- Norm isn't at some party, you know?
By now he's probably had all his valuables taken, been strip-searched, been deloused and thrown into a dark, cold cell with a sex-starved pervert.
So?
That's how he describes a typical evening at home.
Hey, come on!
I'm looking for an attorney that specialises in criminal federal offences.
You're going to be defending the best friend I have and money is no object.
How much?
For one guy?
Stick your writ in your briefs, you ambulance chaser.
Let's let a young public defender make a name for himself on this one.
I wish you'd see this through my eyes.
I'd like to see this through your eyes.
Come on, Carla.
Norm's such a sweet, cuddly guy.
The jury will look in his sad eyes.
They won't fry him.
- But my career hangs in the balance.
- I'd like to see you hang in the balance.
I notice a certain recurring theme in your comments here, Carla.
Norm was doing you a favour.
You don't even know if you are going to get into trouble, Cliffie.
Will you get off my back?
I'll do the gutsy thing and call the post office and get Norm out of there.
I'll call them and tell them it was the O'Hara kid.
He won't mind time in jail, if you get my drift.
- This isn't a joke.
- Where's your sense of humour?
If Norm was here, he'd laugh.
If Norm was here, he'd tear out your tonsils and feed them to you.
All right, I'll call and see what the penalty is, but it's got to be anonymous.
OK, everybody in favour of Cliff calling, raise your hand.
It's anonymous.
Not even an extension.
It's just what I wanted to hear.
How'd you make out, Sam?
Lousy.
They won't let Norm go unless the post office drops charges.
Cliff's going to have to tell the truth.
I've got to talk to him.
- He's on the phone now.
- Confessing?
No, he's finding out what would happen if he did.
Meantime, you got other problems.
The furnace guy didn't show up?
No.
We decided somebody should climb into the duct and try to open it.
- Who?
- The skinniest person we could think of.
You're kidding me.
Diane agreed to crawl around in the air duct?
She had to.
She'd been shooting her face off about it all day.
- Where is she?
- I'm beneath you.
I always knew that, but My goodness!
Well, looky here.
- How about that.
- I'm glad you find this amusing.
What are you doing down there?
Aerobics, you idiot.
Why don't you get out of there, so I can fix it?
I can't crawl any further and my clothes are snagged on something.
I can't back up.
I'm stuck right here.
OK, egg-toss fans, step right up!
Hit the geek and win a beer.
Three eggs for a nickel.
Sam, aren't you going to step in?
You bet your booties I am.
I only got a dime, give me six.
Sam, please.
Carla, how could you suggest such a thing?
Terrible.
I'll go down in the basement and see if I can get you out.
Thank you.
Sam, will you put the grate back, please?
Someone almost stepped on my face.
With the cutest little satin pumps.
- Thanks.
- All right?
My supervisor confirmed exactly what I had suspected all along.
That he hired you as a token weenie.
No, he said a courier who let somebody else deliver his mail could face a hearing where he could be suspended or even relieved from duty.
- What about Norm?
- Norm's got no previous record.
They'll just give him a suspended sentence and a sharp reprimand.
Cliff, you're wrong.
You know you're wrong.
- You should be ashamed of yourself.
- Coach is right, Clifford.
You don't deserve to have a friend like Norman if you let him down now.
So either you go in there and straighten this out or we will.
We're never going to let you show your face in here again.
All right.
I'll call my supervisor and explain the whole thing in the morning.
- Now!
- All right.
Now.
I'll go explain the whole thing now.
I want you all to know that this is going to mean the end for me.
Yeah, I'll be a civilian, one of the crowd.
There's a lot of things I'll miss, too.
The free mucilage, the twine.
The open-with-care labels we stick on our flies at the Christmas party.
The uniform, the respect.
I'm leaving here a mailman.
I'm coming back a nobody.
Diane, I can't get to you.
The opening of the air duct is too small.
Coach, call the furnace man, please, and tell him it's an emergency.
I already called him again, honey, this evening.
He said he might not make it at all.
- Sam, do something.
- I know somebody else I can call.
But listen.
I mean this.
If you say the word, I will rip this floor up to get you out of there.
- Do it, Sam, please.
- That's not the word.
- Swine.
- No, you're getting colder.
Come on, now, sweetheart, open up.
You don't know how long you're going to be in there.
You've got to stay warm.
There you go!
I'm sorry.
You know, Diane, the important thing here is just to relax and stay calm.
Just remember, rats sense fear.
Here you go, darling.
How's that?
Sam, I'm not hungry and I'm not cold.
I just want to get out of here.
I know, sweetheart.
The guy I called said he'll be here in a minute.
Say Just on the off chance that the guy's not able to get you out of there, don't you think you'd feel better if you declared your love for me now, while you still had the chance?
You're right, Sam.
What did you say?
Let go!
She said she loves me, always has, always will.
You're off the clock, sweetheart.
Only a dollar?
No, it's happy hour.
It's only 50 cents.
Pucker up, baby!
Hold it.
Go sit down!
How could you do that?
It's all right, Sammy.
He had all his shots in the army.
Great news, everybody!
Because of my spotless record, I only received a 30-day suspension.
What about Norm?
Is he getting out?
My supervisor already called the cops.
Virtue triumphs again.
Set them up, Sammy, drinks are on me.
I guess I've got to give you credit.
That wasn't an easy thing to do.
What do you suppose is going to happen when the big guy walks through that door?
Our attitude should be he's paid his debt to society.
Let him start a new life.
That's not exactly what Carla had in mind, Cliff.
He's going to be sore at you, Cliffo.
- I suppose he is and perhaps justly so.
- Perhaps?
Underneath that anger is going to be love and understanding.
We go back a long way, he and I. When that big fella comes in, I'm just going to go up to him, admit my error and ask for his forgiveness.
- Here comes Norm now.
- Good.
If I know him, his understanding will not long be withheld.
Come on, you guys!
- I'll kill him!
- Come on.
- But first I want to hurt him a whole lot.
- Take him over there.
Get him out of here.
Out of this bar, out of my life for ever.
Normie, I'll go.
But I want you to remember one thing.
I confessed and got you out of jail.
I wouldn't have been in jail if it wasn't for you!
All right, I'm sorry about that, Normie.
I'm really sorry, but try and understand.
Your job's just a job, but being a mailman's my whole identity.
I risked my whole world, my entire life, to buy your freedom, because I love you, Norm.
Come on, Norm, isn't there something Cliff can do?
Norman, he's right.
What is your heart telling you?
- Never mind.
It's a long story.
- Goodbye, Norm.
All right, wait, Cliffie.
I guess we have been friends a long time.
You are, by nature, a weasel.
There's something you can do for me, I guess.
You can buy me a beer with your pants around your ankles.
- You can't be serious, Norm.
- Ankles, Cliffie.
Standing on that stool while barking like a seal.
Let's not stay.
There'll be a cover charge.
English
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
IF EVER I WOULD LEAVE YOU Diane, are you ready?
It's time for "The Sorrow And The Pity".
Are you two going straight home to bed?
You know it's a movie.
Not just a movie.
It's the final feature in the Human Brutality Film Festival.
Sammy, when's the Coach back from visiting his sister?
- He'll be in Minnesota another week.
- Is his sister anything like the Coach?
Let me put it this way.
He asked her to pick him up at the airport.
She thought he meant the Boston airport so she drove here to pick him up.
Fortunately, that's what he meant.
They had lunch at the airport.
Then they drove on to St. Paul.
I thought she lived in Duluth.
She does, but they don't like the food at the airport in Duluth.
Actually, Coach will probably be back before I could explain this to you.
Let's get out of here.
All the goofs have gone home.
Nobody to laugh at or buy us beer.
I think our work here is done.
Amen.
Is that Carla's positively-disgusting ex-husband Nick?
All right.
Things are picking up, Cliffie.
Have a seat.
Hello, blondie.
I bet you thought you'd never see me again, right?
Change "thought" to "begged God" and you've got it exactly.
- Hey, Nick.
- Hello, Sam.
And the rest of you.
It's so good to see some friendly faces.
My, can I use that now.
- Is something wrong?
- Yeah, but let's not dwell on it.
It would tear your heart out.
Is Carla around?
- No, she went home for the night.
- Frasier, your tea is ready.
Nick Tortelli, this is someone with whom you have absolutely nothing in common, my paramour, Doctor Frasier Crane.
Doctor of what?
Can you get any pills?
I'm a psychiatrist.
Have we met?
Are you the bogus missing link exhibited at the Amsterdam World's Fair?
No, but you're not the first person who asked me.
I wish I had done that.
Maybe my life would be worth something.
What's going on here?
What's the matter, Nick?
- You remember my wife, Loretta?
- Sure do.
Tall.
Blonde.
She ran out on me.
She always wanted to be a singer.
She got an offer from this big musical group that's touring the country.
The Grinning Americans.
The grinning what?
They're wholesome young people, who wear pullover sweaters, sing patriotic songs.
They've had me and Ma marching around the living room on more than one Sunday afternoon.
You live with your mother, Cliff?
I have my own room.
I have my own hot plate.
You want to read something sicko into that?
- You're not the first to lose a woman.
- You haven't heard the worst.
Loretta wouldn't marry me unless I signed a pre-nuptial agreement and put everything in her name.
I was up to my eyeballs in amore that night.
She got the house and the Tortelli Television Hospital.
- Let me get you a drink.
- I don't have anything.
- I couldn't pay.
- It's on the house.
Nick Tortelli don't take charity or pity, or soda.
So make it neat, Sam.
I forgot my purse.
Nick.
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I came to see if I have any friends left.
Sorry, our new snail pellets took care of them.
You look pretty, Carla.
The twinkie left you, didn't she?
She took you for everything, didn't she?
Tell me she took you for everything.
I was born into this world naked and so shall I leave it.
Please stay fully-clothed the rest of the time.
You got a guy, Carla?
No, I swallowed a beach ball.
For your information, I am not seeing anybody, but the guy that knocked me up and ran this time is ten times classier than you.
Get out.
I have no reason to expect any kindness from you.
I treated you like dirt.
But I've come back to start over again.
I would like to make it up to you and my children, if you give me a chance.
I don't know what to say, Nick.
Part of me wants to laugh in your face.
The rest of me wants to throw up.
Go with your heart.
Just how dumb do you think I am?
She kicks you out and you expect me to believe that you're a sweet guy that wants to do right by me?
What would it take to convince you?
- Forget it.
- Wait.
I'm going to hold my hand over this flame until you believe my sincerity.
Go ahead.
I happen to be fond of the smell of roast pig.
Yuck, he's going to do it.
Say you believe me and end my torment.
Say, Nick, shouldn't you be putting it a little closer down to the flame?
What, are there rules to this?
It's plenty warm up here where it is.
Nick, you're roach droppings.
I never want to see you again in my life.
You're her friends.
You believe me, don't you?
You'll talk to her, won't you?
Diane, we've missed the Sorrow, but maybe we can still catch the Pity.
Mr Tortelli, I hate to see any human suffer without doing something to help.
I'd like you to call this number any time, day or night.
- Is this your office?
- No, I'm far out of your price range.
This is the number of a promising graduate student.
You could put him on the map.
- Good night, Sammy.
Nick.
- See you later, Nick.
You fellas going home to your warm beds?
Yup.
That's where we're going.
You got a place to sleep tonight, don't you?
- Yeah, in the gutter out front.
- Good.
As long as you got a place.
They say people don't get involved, Cliff.
Nick, I'm afraid I'm going to have to close up here.
I know.
Just one more thing, Sam, OK?
Could I do a few odd jobs for you for a few bucks?
Boy, I really don't need anything, Nick.
Sam, you don't understand.
I'll do anything.
A man without a job isn't a man, Sam.
I'll sweep, I'll clean, I'll get on my knees and scrub the place.
The place will be spotless, Sam.
Please Sam, thank you.
Thank you.
God bless you, Sam.
- The broom's in the closet.
- Tonight?
That's a little short notice.
I'll do it.
Hello, Miss Carla.
You're looking mighty pretty today.
- But that railing looks terrible.
- Terrible?
I can see my face in it.
That's what I mean.
So can I. I told you, if he's bothering you, I'll get rid of him.
I don't care what he does.
I enjoy seeing him grovel around.
Carla, God knows I was as sceptical as you are, but the man has been working here for three weeks.
He's rented a room with a sink.
He's joined a Christian support group.
He's teaching himself to play the harmonica.
Isn't it possible that he's changed?
He's also clipped his fingernails and he's talked about subscribing to a magazine.
But you look beyond the glitter and flash, that's the same old Nick.
He's doing this to impress me, so I'll take him back.
Is that such a bad idea?
I'm just asking.
He may be starting to pull the wool over your eyes, but he's not doing it to me.
If I take him back, I'll end up getting hurt.
I won't be the one to argue his case, but in the interest of human charity, perhaps you should keep an open mind.
In the interest of human charity, I wouldn't walk across the room to spit on his shoes.
Pardon me, common scrub person, is there a Nick Tortelli here?
- Loretta.
- Nick, is that you?
No, it's the Archbishop of Canterbury.
- So you couldn't stay away from me?
- The very idea is ludicrous.
We've simply outgrown each other.
I'm living in the fast lane now.
I hobnob with people you wouldn't even feel comfortable with.
Last night I met a head waiter.
So you came to rub my nose in it, right?
Hi, gang at Cheers.
Just because I've given Nick the boot doesn't mean that we can't be friends.
Especially you, Carla.
After all, we did have Nick Tortelli in common.
Yeah, you, me and 1,000 head lice.
- What are you doing here?
- These are the divorce papers.
Read them and sign them.
And please, let's not make this sticky.
If you think I'm going to give you any argument about this, you're nuts.
I'm over you, Loretta.
Carla won't give me the time of day yet, but I'd rather be scrubbing the floor that she walks on, than scrubbing the floor that you walk on.
That wasn't too good, but you get the picture.
I'm glad to hear that you're over me, Nick, because as far as I'm concerned, you're yesterday's newspapers.
Well, goodbye, gang at Cheers.
I'm sorry you had to witness this ugly scene.
Beat it!
And that, Carla, if you'll excuse me for ending a sentence in a preposition, is a man whose shoes you wouldn't cross the room to spit upon.
What can I say, Diane?
I was wrong.
It's a start.
- May I take your coat, Miss Carla?
- Knock it off, Nick.
Please, for me.
Shame on me.
This coat rack needs to be sanded down and varnished.
- So you and Nick took the kids out?
- Yeah.
It was Nick's idea.
We took them to the petting zoo, so they could slap the animals.
Listen, tonight after work, me and you, what do you say, like the old times?
We'll go to the White Castle, get burgers and catch some wrestling?
There's a couple of grudge matches.
Forget it.
I'd enjoy that with a classy guy, but you and I aren't happening.
Carla, what do I have to do?
Don't you believe that people change?
You hit rock bottom, then you've got to change or there's no living with yourself.
Sam understands that.
He was a stinking drunk.
I had a problem, Nick.
Miss Diane understands.
She's hustling hooch now.
It wasn't too long ago she was strapped to a bed in the drooling academy.
It was only once that I was restrained to my bed for my own safety when psychotropic drugs affected my balance.
That was only for a week and a half, I was told.
Anyway, what are we talking about me for?
Carla, why will you not relent?
Because I don't believe you have it in you to be true to me.
If Loretta came back, you would go to her.
You're going to believe me one day and I'm going to hang in until you do.
If you'll excuse me, I have to finish oiling the coasters on Sam's office chair.
Fixing the big wheel's little wheels.
I appreciate it, Nick.
Carla, Cliff and I took alley-oop there to the drive-in over the weekend.
All he could talk about was you.
Miss Carla this.
Miss Carla that.
I am tired of hearing all of you defending that walking hairball.
You want to see why I don't fall for his act?
OK, watch.
What's the extension in your office?
Two two, one.
Nick?
This is Loretta.
I've been getting some of those old feelings again, daddy.
I think we should get together and talk.
I'm at the Baldwin Hotel.
- How soon could you come over?
- I've got to get some cigarettes.
- You don't smoke.
- I'm going to start.
I heard good things.
No.
I'm not going to go.
You know where I was going?
Loretta called me and she wanted to talk to me.
And I was about to go.
Then you know what happened?
I thought of you and I came to my senses.
That wasn't Loretta, Nick.
That was Carla on the phone.
- That was you?
- Yes, daddy.
That was a test and I passed with flying colours.
Now do you believe me?
Carla, how can you stand there and deny the man burgers and wrestling with the woman he loves?
- He knew it was me on the phone.
- Carla, what more can I do?
That wasn't a good enough test.
Hi, Carla.
Hi, Nick.
Hi, gang at Cheers.
- The real Loretta.
- Surprise.
- What do you want?
- I want you back.
What?
Well, this isn't easy to say and I don't know what song it's from, but there's a line in some song that goes, "I've got you under my skin.
" I've Got You Under My Skin, Loretta.
What?
No, this is going to complicate things.
No, I was just telling you the name of the song.
Pardon me.
Nick, what I'm trying to say is, do you think there's ever a chance that we'll get back together again?
In my heart I knew this day would come.
The other day when I was here with the papers, something stirred inside of me.
Back at the hotel room, all I could think about is the way you used to make me pour Amaretto in your chin dimple so I could sip it out.
I've got so much to learn from this man.
Loretta, I don't feel anything for you any more.
You hear me?
Nothing.
But you said you'd always love me.
I'm a complex guy.
You can say no to my words, but can you say no to this?
I've got another one where this came from.
You're making a fool out of yourself.
Beat it.
This is one American who's going to have trouble grinning on stage tonight.
Bravo.
Well, I have some oiling to complete.
In God's name, what more do you want?
It is the most startling metamorphoses one man has ever undergone.
You're all experts on Nick Tortelli?
You all think I should go back with him?
Not me.
I don't think you're good enough for him.
OK.
I'm going to take him back.
You all watch what's going happen.
- Nick, can I speak to you?
- Yes, Miss Carla.
Nick, I want you back.
I want to give you another chance to take care of me and the kids.
Carla, you've made me the happiest man on Earth.
Let's go to White Castle and celebrate!
I knew I'd get you back if I kept mopping and cleaning the ashtrays and believing.
But I've got to tell you, that last test was the hardest.
Test, Nick?
The way you actually got Loretta to come here and do what she did.
I don't know how you did it.
It wasn't a test, Nick.
- It wasn't?
- No.
- She really wants me back?
- That's right.
Well, good.
I'm glad to see that you're above that sort of thing.
It's you and me forever.
Really, Nick?
I can't believe it.
What's the matter?
I don't know.
Something weird, Carla.
I can't control my body.
I don't know what's going on.
I'm going to find a cure for this, if it kills me.
Goodbye, Carla.
I love you.
Loretta!
On the way over to the bar this morning, I saw this amazing cloud formation.
It looked like a flock of sheep.
It was really Satisfied?
You're all ignorant.
Carla, I'm sorry.
I don't know what to say.
We made a terrible mistake.
But our regret is tempered by our pride in you.
You didn't fall for him.
You didn't give in.
You stayed strong and you came out on top.
This is your day, Carla.
Rejoice.
Yeah, this is my day, except for one thing.
I love the monkey more now than I ever did.
That monkey?
It's crazy, isn't it?
I don't think it is.
Listen to me.
What you're feeling right now for Nick, every woman has felt it sometime.
We all fall for some guy that we know isn't good for us.
We need excitement.
We need a walk on the wild side.
I know whereof I speak.
Believe it or not, there are times I'm irresistibly drawn to that damn Sam urai Samurai Frasier Crane.
Warrior of Love.
That's what I call him.
Samurai Frasier Crane.

THE EXECUTIVE'S EXECUTIONER Fine.
It's been a pleasure serving you.
Wait a minute.
Is this for me?
Wow, a quarter!
He left me a whole quarter.
Considering the great service I gave him, I was expecting a big tip, but nothing of this magnitude.
Thanks to him I am on Easy Street.
Now I'm going to retire.
All right.
I'll give you some more, OK?
Here.
- You have change of a ten?
- Yeah.
Now beat it.
Everybody, you better stay on my good side today.
Cliff, I've looked at you from every angle.
There is no good side.
What's the problem there, Cliffie?
A new couple moved in next door to me and Ma.
They're loud, noisy, up till all hours playing their bebop music, automobile parts strewn all over the yard.
Nothing I can use.
Why don't you have a word with these people?
They're not that type of people.
It'll only lead to a fight and you know what I'm liable to do.
Yeah, wet yourself.
My God!
That's my boss.
He saw me slip out early.
- You got here the same time as always.
- I know.
I always leave early.
I refuse to be one of those cowardly clock-watchers.
As soon as my supervisor turns his head, I slip out the heating duct.
- How would he know you're here?
- The company's full of spies.
They know everything about you.
They even keep track of your sex habits.
Thank God I don't have any.
He's coming this way.
Cover for me.
Wait a minute!
Excuse me, wasn't that Norm Peterson?
No, there's no Norm Peterson here.
I don't even know a Norm Peterson.
Are you sure?
The man that just ran into the men's room?
Absolutely not.
Probably somebody that looked like Norm Peterson - who I don't know.
- I see.
And what's this on the floor?
Foam insulation from our heating duct.
My information is correct.
Peterson, are you in here?
- Were you talking to me?
- What are you doing in there?
Sir, this is close to being an invasion of privacy.
But I want to talk to you.
I'll wait outside.
No, sir.
I know what you're probably going to do to me and this does seem like the appropriate place for it.
All right.
Peterson, we've been making some changes in the company.
Starting tomorrow, we want you to be our corporate killer.
The guy who fires people?
We decided that terminating employees puts too much stress on our executives.
- We think you'll be perfect.
- Why me?
Studies have shown that it's particularly humiliating when you're fired by somebody who is clearly superior to yourself.
And that just wouldn't be the case with you, Norman.
You're just an ordinary Joe.
As a matter of fact, we checked out your home life.
You have absolutely nothing anyone could possibly envy or resent.
I'm honoured, sir.
But this sounds like a horrible job, frankly.
It's a 300% raise and if you don't take it, you're fired.
I will have you know that I cannot be bought and I cannot be threatened, but you put the two together and I'm your man.
Have you given any thought to using some form of natural childbirth this time?
- I always use the Le Mans method.
- No, you mean Lamaze.
No, Le Mans.
I scream like a Ferrari.
- Evening, everybody.
- Norm!
What will you have, Norm?
A glass of whatever comes out of that tap.
- Looks like beer, Norm.
- Call me Mr Lucky.
I'll take another one for my young friend there.
- So who is your young friend?
- It's my first assignment, Cliffie.
I was supposed to fire him this morning.
I haven't been able to do it yet.
You've been with the guy all day and you haven't canned him?
He's such a sweet kid.
I just can't tear his heart out.
- Can I do it, please?
- Do you mind?
I know what you're talking about.
It's always hard to fire people.
I always give my waitresses the benefit of a severance boink.
That or the money equivalent, $1.14.
As I recall, you were always after an advance.
Oh, Sam.
You're always bringing that up, trying to relive those few precious weeks with the only woman you ever dated who knew how to spell your name.
As I recall, you used to spell it E- X-T-A-S-Y.
You got the "X" right.
And it's going to stay that way.
Could we move on to something more interesting than your star-crossed romance?
What could be more interesting than another gripping episode of "The Young and the Chestless"?
So when are you going to talk to the guy?
I've been struggling with it all day, Sammy.
I was going to tell him at lunch, but we were enjoying ourselves so much.
So I thought I'd take him to a movie, try to get him relaxed.
- You couldn't tell him there, either?
- No, but I came close at the ball game.
Norman, as you know, no one is more sensitive than I. And I say putting it off is of no value to you or the boy.
I guess you're right.
Thanks for the beer, Mr Peterson.
I sure have had a good time today.
It's great to get away from that old sweat shop, isn't it?
I love my job.
The five months I've had it have been the best of my life.
- Isn't that exaggerating a bit, Billy?
- Not at all.
Ever since I can remember I've dreamed of being an accountant.
From the age of six I did odd jobs to put myself through college.
Now that I have it, I've got the world at my feet.
I just put a down payment on a house.
It was more than we wanted, but escrow closed today so there's no turning back now.
Besides, with my wife pregnant, we're going to need the room.
Your My wife and I are trying to have a baby, actually.
That's great!
Our kids are going to play together at the company picnic.
- I don't think so, Billy.
- Why not?
Because you're fired.
- I'm fired?
- It's not your fault.
You're history.
It's the damn company.
They're cutting back all over the place.
You're a good accountant.
I'm so sorry.
I can't believe it.
It's not fair!
You're so damn young.
That's right.
I've got that going for me.
- I'll find something else.
- In this job market?
Good luck.
There, there, Mr Peterson.
Don't worry about me.
I'll be just fine.
I'm going to make you happy and proud again.
Are you going to be OK?
Come on, show me a big smile.
Come on.
Come on.
Attaboy.
Stand up here.
Get him a beer there, Diane.
So how did it go, Norm?
Damn company!
What do they know about the pride in a young wife's eye?
The unborn child and a boy's love of a calculator?
- Norman, stop torturing yourself.
- And us.
I guess Billy Richter's not going to be the only one without a job.
I'm not cut out to be a corporate killer.
I watched you with that young man.
I've never seen anything like that.
Hey, pal, this is the 1980s.
It's OK for a man to cry.
- Thanks, buddy.
- You'd never catch me doing it.
Maybe a manly tear or two, but never blubbering.
It's a policy at Talbert International to send a representative to check on how employees handle new assignments.
I've been following you around all day.
How did you like Rice's catch in the third inning?
That was a great catch.
I guess you'll tell them to find another killer.
I'm relieved, actually.
You made that man feel that he was fired from a sensitive, caring company.
It was brilliant.
I'm going to recommend that they give you that corner office on the third floor.
- Isn't that Mr Peabody's office?
- Not after you talk with him tomorrow.
I've had it!
Those neighbours have pushed me too far this time.
- What happened now, Clifford?
- Last night they had a party.
Cars parked all over the block, loud music and who knows what else.
And all this on a school night.
It's time they found out what you get when you cross a Clavin.
Someone crossed one with a chicken and got you.
I beg your pardon?
You shoot your mouth off about this guy, but you don't do anything.
- You're afraid to stand up to him.
- I'm not afraid of anything.
One of these days I'll tell that jerk exactly what I think of him.
All right, here you go.
- Write him a letter.
- You don't think I will?
"Howdy, neighbour.
Please don't take this the wrong way " Give me that!
"Howdy, neighbour"!
Let me do this.
"Dear vile, scurvy rat, "whose existence stinks up the planet " I guess that is a bit stronger.
Where's Norm?
He's in the back room dropping the axe on his latest victim.
It'll be all right.
I'll find another job some day.
You promise?
I promise.
Now buck up.
That man is a prince.
Norman, why do you keep putting yourself through this?
You must be emotionally drained at the end of the day.
Yeah, I am, but I'm good at it.
I finally found something in life that I'm good at.
Pity.
Now we just got to finish it off with a real doozy.
Does he have any disabilities you can make fun of?
His wife is not particularly handsome.
Good, good.
"Bark hello to your wife for me.
" "Yours in disgust.
" Sign that.
I'll sign it with pleasure and I'll mail this at my earliest convenience.
- It's going out in today's mail.
- Good, good.
Glad to hear it.
Look, Clavin, just think of this as your ticket out of Weenietown.
- I made that trip a long time ago.
- But they threw you out at Dinkville.
Norm, your office called.
They're sending over a John Parker.
Another one?
Last one of the day, I guess.
Let's see what we got here.
John Parker.
He's a widower, supports sickly parents.
Three foster children.
So sad, so sad.
- Afternoon, Sam.
How are we today?
- Fine, Walt.
How are you doing?
It hasn't been an easy day, but any day I carry the US mail I count myself a lucky and useful human being.
- Are all you guys like this?
- Like what?
Never mind.
Hold on a sec, Walt, I've got some outgoing mail here.
How do you like that?
I just talked to Ma.
Our neighbour's cleaning up his yard.
He would've gotten to it sooner, but he's been in training for the World Kick Boxing Championship.
It's good I found out before that letter was mailed.
That's excellent use of the nine-digit zip code, Sam.
Consider these letters in the hands of the addressees.
Hold on there.
Twitchell, isn't it?
Clavin, South Central Branch, SCB.
Oh, right.
You got a letter in that bag that I don't need mailed.
I'd appreciate it if I could have it back.
- Sorry.
- What do you mean "sorry"?
Any letter on my person for the express purpose of delivery receives the same sanctity as in any US Mail receptacle.
But this is a very personal, important matter to me.
You know the rules.
Hey, that's my bag!
That's a Federal offence, you know.
Get out of here!
That's Clavin.
Clavin with a "C", right?
- You're in trouble.
- You're in trouble!
- They're going to have your bags.
- Your mother's a bag.
Put a uniform on some guys, it turns them right into a fascist.
I wouldn't be a bit surprised if that guy had deep sexual problems.
Norm is sleeping like a baby.
A baby with a licence to kill.
I guess this job is taking its toll.
I wonder what he's dreaming about?
He's probably dreaming about what every man dreams about.
In your case that would be me.
I hardly think that Norm is dreaming about you.
I stand corrected.
- You OK?
- I'm fine.
Strangest dream.
It was so weird, Sam.
It was really dark, you know?
And cold and eerie.
It was out in the middle of nowhere, but it was definitely somewhere.
There was this line of accountants.
It was my job to make them go through a pair of elevator doors.
Going down.
One by one they went, falling screaming into a bottomless pit.
There's this accountant wearing a blindfold.
I went up to him.
No, wait.
I'm just demonstrating.
Norman, don't you see what this dream means?
A very precious part of you feels as if it's being destroyed by this job.
The burden of your guilt is insupportable.
I never said I was in love with this job, OK?
I think it stinks.
But it is important.
These guys would all be fired anyway.
I provide a service.
I'm helping them through a painful experience.
Norman, these executives are having you do their dirty work.
- You are their Judas goat.
- Lighten up, will ya, Diane?
You should have more pride than to do repugnant tasks for people at their bidding.
You want to wipe up that bar sweat there?
- Can I get you something?
- No.
- Are you OK?
- No.
Norm Peterson invited me for a beer at Cheers.
- He's sitting down right over there.
- So that's him?
Hi.
You must be John Parker.
Norm Peterson here.
I know.
It's really terrible what you have to do to me, isn't it?
- You know why you're here?
- Everybody knows about you.
Then I guess there's nothing left to say.
What do you mean?
Where's my sympathy?
Where's the caring?
Where's the tears?
- I do feel bad for you, John.
- Doesn't look like it.
Honestly, John, I feel just awful.
You've foster children, I believe?
Yes.
One of them needs braces.
I would rather have somebody fire me honestly than fake sentiment.
You hide your true feelings behind crocodile tears.
John, listen, wait a second.
Let me try again, John.
Sickly parents.
I'm dry as a bone.
Do you know what's happening to you, Norman?
- You're becoming callous and hard.
- Yeah, I know.
Give me the phone and a beer.
- What are you doing?
- Quitting.
I'm calling Mr Simpson and telling him I'm resigning.
I'm going to let the bosses do their own dirty work for a change.
Mr Simpson?
This is Norm Peterson, sir.
We really have to have a Hello?
He screamed and hung up.
I'll try him again.
Is this Mr Simpson's secretary?
This is Norm Peterson.
We seem to have been Hello?
You see what's happening here, don't you?
This is amazing.
Why don't I just give Mr Hecht a little call?
Why don't I tell him how good the little plan is going?
Mr Hecht, this is Norm Peterson.

{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
CHEERIO CHEERS - Hi, everybody.
- Hi, Carla.
Sam, I'm sorry I'm late.
I realise I left you here without a waitress.
What am I?
Chopped liver?
No, some people enjoy chopped liver.
- What got you in such a bad mood?
- I don't know.
Everything.
This morning I was thinking I'm not married, I'm carrying my sixth kid.
I'm broke, I live in squalor - I'm having a crisis of faith.
- Don't talk like that.
Would a just God be putting me through this?
Well, I know it looks sort of bleak out there.
But you just have to have patience.
Remember Job.
Cliffie's right, honey.
You got a good Job here.
- You're in great health - I don't know.
I didn't want to embarrass you in front of Carla, but you pronounce the word "job".
Frasier, what a surprise to see you here.
Diane, I've got the most exciting news.
What is it?
You're positively tingling.
Sit down.
I have been awarded an honour that surpasses anything I've hoped for.
It goes beyond even my most wild and ambitious dreams.
Are we talking Nobel Prize?
- No, we're not talking Nobel Prize.
- A Pulitzer?
- Not the Pulitzer Prize.
- A Guggenheim Fellowship.
- No, it's not a Guggenheim Fellowship.
- A canned ham?
You lost the big ones.
I knew I should have waited.
Diane, I have been chosen to be this year's visiting scholar at the University of Bologna.
- Frasier, that's wonderful.
- The University of Bologna?
I can't believe they need a university for a thing like that.
- I know it's a complicated meat, but - Coach.
The University of Bologna is the oldest university in the world.
It has what is arguably the finest school of psychology in Europe.
Now inarguably the finest.
Who's the dean, Oscar Mayer?
I hear sausage jokes are making a comeback.
Now here's the exciting news.
My teaching load will provide us ample time to travel throughout Europe.
- Us?
- I thought you'd notice that.
I'm leaving in two weeks and I'd love for you to come along.
Why, that would be wonderful, wouldn't it?
- How long would we be gone?
- Six months.
This would be a very big undertaking.
So many details to take care of.
My apartment, a passport.
My plants, my classes, Sam, paper, my dry-cleaning.
- Sam?
- Well, yes.
You know what a devastating effect it had on him the last time I left.
He's fragile.
He can be wounded.
Hey, Doc.
Ever seen a guy do push-ups with his tongue?
- Well, no, I haven't.
- Watch this.
You see, Diane?
Even without you his life is very full.
Frasier, I'm serious.
All right.
I was Sam's therapist.
I'll tell him and observe his reaction.
If he shows any anxiety whatsoever, I'll be here to assuage it.
- Can I have a word with you?
- Sure, Doc.
What's up?
- Diane and I are going to Europe.
- Europe?
Overseas?
Well, we were going to go to the local one, but it's all booked up.
I'm going to be teaching there for six months and Diane is going with me.
And you may never see her again.
Well, that's I'm happy for you guys.
Maybe I should throw you a bon voyage party.
What do you think?
- You're not bothered?
- Not bothered?
How delightfully naive.
He's repressing.
Come along, Sam.
- I want to have a little chat with you.
- What are we going to talk about?
The emotions that you're repressing right now.
I'm here for you and I won't leave until you can deal with this.
She doesn't want to go to Europe.
She's still harbouring feelings for you.
- Come on, Frasier.
That again?
- Yes.
You should have seen the look on her face when I asked her just now.
She is a great cure for happiness, isn't she?
You can't expect her to jump up and down with joy right off the bat.
- I'd love to know why.
- Because Diane is Diane.
She's never done anything without thinking about it.
She analyses everything.
If you were to say, "Can I offer you a million dollars"?
she'd say, "No, no, no.
That's may I offer you a million dollars"?
' I admit she does have a tendency to be cerebral.
I never pictured myself in a relationship where I would be the wild and impulsive one.
Let's be fair, though.
She does know how to show a man a good time.
You're right.
We'd be out and she'd say, "Look.
Those guys are having fun.
" Come on.
I'll bet she comes around.
I bet she's outside right now thinking this whole Europe thing's a good idea.
- You really think so?
- Yeah, I know so.
- How is he?
- He'll be all right.
- I already got my sense of humour back.
- Good man.
Sam, you were really bothered by this news?
I just used Sam as a cover.
It was me.
I was hurt that your reaction to my Europe news was half-hearted.
Well, I've had a little time to think about it now.
And I want you to know that Europe sounds wonderful.
I can't imagine a more romantic place or a more appropriate person with whom to share it.
That's wonderful.
Sam said you'd come around.
Lucky guess.
Dear, may I have a moment alone with Sam?
Certainly.
I'm late for my session as it is.
Bye-bye, Sam.
How I hate you.
I'd love to smack that smug look off your face.
You're pretending not to care because you believe that Europe will be the death-knell for my relationship with Frasier Crane.
Either because I won't go at all or because the stress of travelling together for six months will break us up.
- Right?
- Listen to me.
I'm sincere about this.
I like you two.
And I want to see you both happy.
Thank you, Sam.
After all, just because us two didn't travel well - When did we ever travel?
- Are you kidding me?
We went through hell together.
Well, it helped that you knew the language.
What are you looking for?
A sign from God?
Religious belief is based on faith.
I never thought I'd say this, Coach, but I think I've lost faith.
Listen up.
I have an announcement to make.
Diane here is leaving for Europe and she's not going to be back ever.
I believe for every drop of rain that falls a flower grows.
I believe that somewhere in the darkest night a candle glows.
You know, Sam, I got to tell you.
I can't see Diane going off with Doc like that.
I always figured that you and her would get married, you know?
- Come on, Coach.
- I'm not kidding.
I pictured you moving to a little home in the country with a rose garden out front and a nice little room in the back for me.
Every Sunday night Diane would make us a fried chicken dinner and we'd sit on the porch and listen to the ball game.
I'd bounce your kids on my knee God, it was going to be a happy house.
I guess that's going to be Frasier's house now.
Well, you can come by any time, Sam.
But call first.
- Let's get out of here.
It's late.
- Time to go for the night.
Good night, guys.
- Later, Sammy.
- See you.
I'm not a sentimental guy, you know.
I'd like you to have a good safe trip.
You big monkey, don't you ever be ashamed of your tender side.
Goodbye, Diane.
Goodbye, Clifford.
Come on, you two.
I'm waiting for a kiss.
Well she is leaving.
Did you see the look on her face?
I was more worried about the look on your face.
Well, Diane.
I'm not going to pretend that you're my favourite person in the world.
But now that it's all over I guess I wish you a happy life.
Thank you.
And I thought I'd do you a favour, so I wrote down a helpful phrase in Italian.
You carry that with you wherever you go.
It means, "Excuse me, Mr Pharmacist.
Where do you keep the peroxide"?
Meet you at the car, Coach.
- I'm going to miss you.
- I'm going to miss you, too.
Listen.
Thank you for coming back.
Will he be OK?
- Well, I hope so.
- Coach, do me a favour.
- Sure.
- Stand by him.
Come back.
Instead of standing by him, why don't you just sort of - watch over him?
- Of course.
Bye, sweetheart.
Well.
- We haven't been alone for a long time.
- No.
- Funny how things change, isn't it?
- Yes.
I still remember the first time I came in here.
What a prissy little snot I was.
Yeah.
Who would have thought it could get worse?
Listen to me.
We both realise that a lot of things can happen when you leave like this.
Who knows when we'll see each other again?
- Do me a favour.
- What's that, Sam?
I've been a real jerk to you sometimes.
But I'd appreciate it if, when you think of me, you remember me as a decent person.
Of course.
I'll remember you as Albert Schweitzer.
I'd like that.
Thank you.
I'm so glad it's ending this way.
After the wrath and acrimony of our breakup.
I thought I'd never see you come in here again.
- Do you know why I came back?
- Sure.
Cos you're a woman and I'm Sammy.
Actually, it was because I was concerned about you.
Your drinking and your health.
Well thank you.
Because it did make a difference.
Who would have thought that we'd ever be standing here as friends?
- We are friends, aren't we?
- Good friends.
Well, I'm off.
Wait.
Let me give my friend a goodbye hug.
Come on.
Get over here.
What?
This really may be the last time we see each other.
Well.
Goodbye, pal.
Goodbye, buddy.
Bye, amigo.
Goodbye, mon ami.
Goodbye, compadre.
Well, that's that.
- I'll be off.
- Yeah, you take care of yourself.
You too, Sam.
- Sam?
- Yeah, chum?
I'm going to count to three and then we'll stop.
You got it.
One.
Two.
Two-and-a-half.
Which leads us to three.
Well, that wasn't so hard, was it?
I think we just counted to three.
You have a nice safe trip.
Thank you.
How could we have ever denied ourselves for so long?
Come on.
- Let's go back to my place.
- Come on, Sam.
Let's go back to your place.
We have to make up for a lot of lost time.
- Sam, wait.
- What?
I knew you couldn't be spontaneous.
I knew you'd over-analyse this.
What is it?
I was just going to say I almost forgot my purse.
Well, let me get that for you, sweetheart.
- What did you think I was going to say?
- That was it.
- What did you think I was going to say?
- I don't know.
I thought you were going to say, "Is this just for tonight "or are we going to start this whole thing over again"?
- I wasn't going to say that.
- Bless you.
- But now that you've brought it up - Damn.
I didn't bring it up, I was just saying that as an example of something we'd never say.
No, Sam, I'm glad you said it.
What exactly is it you have in mind?
Is it a beginning or an ending?
Hello or goodbye?
One night of passion or something that will last beyond tomorrow?
This conversation will last beyond tomorrow.
Just a minute ago we were hot for each other.
I wasn't hot.
I was insane.
I was insane.
I was about to abandon the most brilliant, sensitive man I ever met for one with the morals of a rutting sea-elephant and the intelligence of lint.
Let's just stop right there before we start insulting each other.
Good idea, Sam.
Goodbye.
Please.
Maybe Frasier can give you an iron-clad guarantee of a lifetime of security.
But with me it's a day at a time.
Now if you can live with that call.
Last I saw, you and Diane were here alone.
Did you give her a goodbye boink?
Your language.
I haven't heard you talk like that in a long time.
I know, but this morning after mass the priest said that he didn't think that Diane's going to Bologna constituted a true miracle.
I told him I had witnesses.
He said he wouldn't even take it to the bishop.
To answer your question Nothing happened between me and Diane.
She wanted to, but you know.
- You OK?
- I'm fine.
Cheers.
No, sorry, Diane's not here.
Oh, you're Diane?
Then you're definitely not here.
No, he's right here.
Sam, it's Diane.
I was hoping you'd call.
I'm in a hotel room in London, Sam.
Hold on one second.
Frasier and I are stopping over on our way to Italy.
So why are you calling?
Well, I'm calling because I've had some time to think about last night.
We both had a moment of weakness and I'm glad we didn't give in to it.
But I hope we're still friends.
I don't think we're friends, Diane.
We failed as lovers.
If we're not friends, what have we been these past months?
We've been kidding ourselves.
- Goodbye, Diane.
- Wait.
Sam?
Nothing.
Bye.
Before you hang up here They got postcards in Europe?
I'm almost sure of it.
Maybe if you think of it you can send me one.
Write small.
You know how I like to read in between the lines.
- I'll try.
- That'd be nice.
Thank you, Sam.
Goodbye, Diane.
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
THE BARTENDER'S TALE - Who's the lovely lady?
- An applicant for the waitress job.
It isn't easy for him to find somebody to work for the wages he pays you.
With tips I clear about 500 bucks a week, Clavin.
- That can't be right, is it?
- I did her taxes.
You're saying that a Federal employee, entrusted with the most noble service of our society, makes less money than a wench who serves beer to slobs on bar stools?
Makes sense to me, Cliffie.
No, really, I could go up to three days or so without mail.
Carla, I'd like you to meet Sydney.
Sydney is an applicant for our waitress opening.
She passed my interview with flying colours.
Pending your approval, I'd like to start her this afternoon.
- Have you served the public before?
- You mean dressed?
Take a hike, Sydney.
I'll call you this afternoon, see how you're doing.
Thank you.
You're a very nice man.
You're nice, too.
We've only known each other for a few minutes, but I feel like we've known each other all day.
- Yeah, me, too.
- You take care.
You know, Sam, when Diane left for Europe thank you, God you promised to hire an actual waitress, not a girl that you love and leave.
They're bad for business.
They never last a week and I do all the work.
You can give your approval before I hire them, but you don't have to be so picky.
I want someone who doesn't make us think of the word boob at the same time.
What is this, IBM?
Come on, let's not argue about this.
We can find somebody who's going to make us both very happy.
- Brenda Wood?
- Hi.
That's me.
Hi there, Brenda.
Come on down here.
Let's take a look at your application.
I see that your turn-ons include banana daiquiris by a fireside, and men in tight jeans.
- You're cute.
- I'm sold.
Come over here.
- I'd like you to meet Brenda.
- Beat it.
- But, Sam - You heard me.
Back to the bimbo union hall.
Darn it, Brenda.
I guess Carla thought you were overqualified.
You know what might ease that sting of rejection?
What would happen if I were to slip into tight jeans this weekend and have you over to my place for a banana daiquiri?
- Do you have a fireplace?
- No, but I got a sofa that's flammable.
- That'd be fine.
- All right.
You take care.
Bye-bye.
- The search continues, Sammy?
- It's tough being me.
- OK, Lillian Huxley.
- How do you do, Mr Malone?
Hi, Lillian.
Thank you for coming down, but this position has been filled already.
- We'll keep your résumé on file.
- Freeze, slimeball.
- Yes, Carla.
- You lech.
This is the best résumé I've ever seen.
Look at these references.
She's been schlepping booze for 25 years.
And my turn-ons include hunting dogs, Thackeray and Welsh rarebit.
She's exactly what we need.
A career waitress.
- You are?
- That I am, Mr Malone.
I'm one of those people who felt the tug of their true calling early in life.
When I was but 18, I filled in one day for a mate at a pub.
Excuse me.
I realised that day that I could have no happier or finer destiny in store than distributing refreshments in a public house.
Through the years I've lead many a rugger side in a bawdy song, and countless times offered my shoulder to cry on.
But never once have I regretted my decision.
I shall consider my life well spent if it can be honestly carved on my gravestone "Lillian Huxley never kept a thirsty man waiting for his ale, "and she always brought him a wee bit more than a pint.
" Bravo!
I'm not too sure I like her attitude.
Bene, molto bene.
Your heat control is over there.
If you need anything, call the front desk.
Thank you very much.
That'll be all.
Listen, 200,000 lire, that's about right, right?
- Grazie, signore.
- Prego.
Frasier, a letter from Cheers.
Wait, it's not a letter.
It's a Lillian Huxley's résumé.
And it's signed, "Ha ha, you're out of here for ever.
" Always nice to hear from Carla.
Diane, Cheers is thousands of miles away.
Let's leave them on the other side of the great ocean?
- Of course.
I love you.
- Et tu, Diane.
Did I just hear you say that you tipped that bellboy 200,000 lire?
What is it?
A dollar or two?
This inflated currency is ridiculous.
I keep expecting a bum to walk up and ask for a million lire for a cup of coffee.
You tipped the man $100 to bring our bags eight feet.
Are you sure?
This'll get a hearty laugh out of the folks at the institute.
Just explain it to him.
I'm sure he'll understand.
- You mean go down and get it back?
- What else?
These people think so little of Americans as it is - I'll go.
- No.
If I send a woman, they'd think even less of me.
I'll do it.
My brave little tourist.
Yes.
I guess it's time to nip this thing in the bud.
Come in.
Let's sing "Don't Dilly Dally On The Way".
No, I'm tired of that one.
How about a little "Knees Up, Mother Brown"?
No, I'm afraid I'm too overcome.
All right, let's sell some beers around here.
My aching back.
My postal career is over.
Cliff, you look terrible.
- Was today Sears catalogue day?
- That's right.
Yeah and that's not all.
Spiegel catalogue came out at the same time.
It's a phenomenon that happens once every 27 years when both marketing strategies are in the same equinox.
- Come here, you great silly sausage.
- What's going on?
Hush, pet.
Fear not.
One, two Hey, Lillian, thank you very much.
I feel like grabbing every woman in the joint and just dancing.
How much to put him back the way he was?
Carla, I've got customers to serve.
Well, Sammy, Lillian's week is almost up.
Will you keep her on?
I'm dying of curiosity.
I admit when I'm wrong.
She's terrific.
The customers love her.
She's perfect.
There's no chance of any romantic complication to screw things up.
Amen.
No more sex stuff with anybody even remotely connected with this bar.
Promise?
On my honour, as a great looking human being.
Anyway, I have just seen the woman in whose arms I hope to die.
Hi there.
Allow me to introduce myself.
I'm Sam Malone, the next love of your life.
- I've heard you Yanks were bold.
- You sound exactly like - Carolyn.
- Mummy.
- Sam.
- Carla.
Your mother never told me she had a daughter.
She never told me she had such a handsome boss.
Carolyn's visiting her old mummy for a few days.
- Lillian, you're up here.
- Excuse me.
I must teach this bloke how to play a proper game of darts.
I'll be back in an embarrassingly short time.
So, Carolyn, how do you like Boston now that you've seen the sight?
- I love it.
- Sam, could I talk to you?
- Not now.
- Now.
I'm on final approach and am cleared for landing.
Haul your butt over here now, sky king.
Will you excuse me for a moment?
What?
If you take Carolyn out, it's going to go bad like always and you'll lose the two best waitresses you ever had.
- Carla, I hardly - I'm warning you.
You go out with her and I quit.
- You don't mean that.
- Try me.
OK, all right.
As far as I'm concerned, Carolyn's off limits.
That's your brain talking, Sam.
I would like to hear from the part of your body that does the thinking.
It's in agreement, too.
I'm sorry to be such a miserable host here.
So you're from England?
Yes.
I'm just in the States for a few days to shoot a layout for British Vogue.
Wait.
That calls for a little of the old welcome-to-the-US champagne.
- Great.
- A little of the old bubbly here.
So you're a model?
Yes, I do lingerie mostly.
Teddies, merry widows, garter belts.
- This is my portfolio.
- I'll give you $1,000 for it.
I don't know if I want you to look at it.
I only brought it in to show mummy.
Come on.
Give her a little privacy.
- I suppose it won't do any harm.
- All right, here we go.
Interesting shot.
I like that one.
That's nice.
That's nice lighting on that one.
Bet they used an f-stop on that one.
Now, see, I like the composition on that.
- What are those?
Ducks?
- Yes, that's right.
I really didn't want to do this one nude, but you know No, I think it's very tasteful.
It makes a point.
Sammy, the ice.
Thank you very much.
Could you just give me a second here?
I'll be right back.
Carla, can I speak to you for a moment here?
Remember that conversation we had about me not going out with Carolyn?
Can we pretend it never took place?
You bet.
I'll just go pack my stuff.
Nice knowing you.
Listen.
come on.
The lady is coming on to me.
If I resist, I could damage some organs here.
I don't care.
If you go out with her, I quit.
OK, all right, fine.
There are millions of women on this planet.
I can certainly forgo one of them.
Ironic that she's the most gorgeous one I've ever seen, but that's life.
Sam, the champagne is marvellous.
You know how to make a girl feel welcome.
That's nothing.
I do that for everybody.
She's really coming on to Sam, isn't she?
Sam.
That's rich.
Norm, your naivety amazes me.
What are you talking about?
She's doing all this for my benefit.
You notice she's talking loud so I can hear everything?
That woman wants me more than any woman has wanted me before.
Cliffie, sometimes you really scare me.
Sam, what about this Cape Cod place I've been hearing about?
I hear that it's terribly romantic at this time of year.
Well, you know, I guess it could be.
Tell me, are there any clothing-optional beaches there?
I like to get an all-over tan.
I know it's more common in Europe than it is in America, so I came prepared with a bikini, but it's such a skimpy little thing.
I'm having a real hard time with this map.
I just can't make head or tail of it.
I really don't think I'm going to be able to find my way there.
I'll take you.
- Great.
What a lovely surprise.
- I'll take you.
I'll let Carla go and I'll take you.
I'll turn this into a self-serve bar and I'll take you.
- When did you have in mind?
- I'll take you right this very minute.
- My car is outside.
- What the hell's going on?
Carla, I can explain this.
I'll take you.
- You make me sick.
- I know.
I'll take you.
Carla, I'm a weak man.
Someday I will find a cure for what I have, but please, let me have this.
Don't make me beg.
Please, don't make me beg, Carla.
- Tell your mommy not to make me beg.
- Get off.
- Is that a yes?
- At least she's not Diane.
- Look, I'll tell you what.
- What?
Tell Lillian you're taking her daughter out.
If she says it's OK, I'll stick around for a while.
Is that all?
I'll do it.
I'll make you proud of me.
Just one more minute.
Have one more for the bed, the beach, the road.
Lillian, can I see you in my office for a minute?
- Certainly.
Back in a jiffy, darling.
- Super, Mummy.
Carolyn's filling out nicely, don't you think?
Lillian, I got a problem here.
In the past I've gotten into trouble with my waitresses by getting romantically involved with them.
You are a fantastic waitress.
I do not want to do anything to lose you.
Don't say another word.
I understand you completely.
- You do?
- Of course.
Thank you.
I just wanted to get your approval first.
Sam, how can you be so civilised when your very blood is boiling?
Don't you think I haven't been feeling the same urges?
Don't you think I haven't felt the same unconquerable chemistry?
Denying ourselves has been as treacherous for me as it has for you.
- That is what you meant, isn't it?
- You bet.
No.
This whole thing just kind of snuck up on me, that's all.
Well, I won't pretend this hasn't happened to me before.
Spend any amount of time in a man's presence and I send out a sort of well, let's face it erotic signals.
Would you wait here for just a minute?
I need to talk to Carla.
Carla is the person that I usually Trust me.
Sam, are you ready to take me down to that Cape?
- Just one minute.
- What happened?
I know it's bad.
Lillian thought I wanted to go out with her.
She's got third-degree Sammies.
- I knew it.
- Don't panic.
I can handle this.
We need a solution.
I can always fall back on the truth.
You can't do that.
If you tell her you're not interested now, she's going to quit.
If she gets hurt and quits, I'll be hurt and quit.
If I get hurt and quit, then you'll be as good as dead.
What am I going to do?
My mind doesn't work like this.
It's trained to get women into bed.
- What would Diane do?
- Talk till we puke.
Probably.
I got it.
Lillian is smarter than us, right?
You go in there and tell her, "Lillian, we can't do this, because well, you know.
" - No.
- That's what you say.
- She'll fill in the rest.
- That's brilliant.
How does the part go that I say again?
Come on.
"We can't do this, because well, you know.
" No, I don't.
I wouldn't be asking you to repeat it if I did.
Right.
That's perfect.
Sam, my dear, you're damp.
It's the sweat of passion.
Lillian, we can't do this because well, you know.
- Yes, I suppose I do.
- You do?
- Sam, why are you dancing?
- I'm just I was relieved that I wasn't the only one who knew why we couldn't do this.
I love this job.
I need this job.
Carla needs me so much.
I would miss all these wonderful people.
We must preserve a proper working relationship no matter what the pain.
It's sad.
I mean, it's so very sad.
Buck up, Sam.
I'm sure it's all for the best.
You're young and not so schooled in the ways of love as I. Such a coupling could be fatal.
I've already had two husbands die in bed.
I'm sorry.
What did they die of?
You child.
Really?
Yes, they fainted, which all my men do.
But they never came to.
They fainted?
You're saying that that's normal?
Well, I don't want to gloat, but yes, it has been known.
Were these healthy guys to begin with?
They weren't athletes such as yourself, but they certainly weren't weaklings.
Why do you ask?
I was just thinking that maybe No, you're absolutely right.
Back to work.
We must get back to work, Sam.
I don't want to beat this to death, but when these guys went, were they smiling?
Ear to ear.
- And that was the grumpy one.
- I'll be darned.
- So, what happened?
- Everything's OK.
I guess.
Sam, are we ever going to get to this Cape?
Right.
You're taking my daughter sightseeing?
- If it's OK with you?
- I think it's an absolutely wonderful idea.
Besides, it will take your mind off what you really want.
Yeah, maybe.
Well, Carolyn, it's just you and me off to that famous Cape.
Here we go.
Do you mind if I ask you kind of a personal question here?
What's that?
Could you tell me, how did your father die?
The coroner said it was a heart attack.
But we all know it was Mummy's passion that killed him.
Well, that's tragic.
Yes.
I suppose that's why I hate sex so.
The very idea gives me the chills.
Well, let's go.
Didn't you
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
THE BELLES OF ST.
CLETES - Morning, Sammy.
- Norm.
What brings you in this time?
- Same thing that always does.
- A little early for a beer.
So float a cornflake in it.
Beer it is.
Seriously, how come you're here this early?
My supervisor had to go home early.
So he left me in charge of the office.
So I closed it.
Thought I'd stop by, have a few beers and figure out what to do with the day.
After all, I have 24 golden hours to spend on Norm Peterson.
- Any suggestions?
- I'd be out there sailing.
Perfect weather, the waters won't be crowded.
I get seasick, though.
I don't know.
Well, you can always go to the driving range and work on your slice.
No, I don't have my clubs with me.
How about checking out that gym you've been putting off joining?
I'm not in the mood for sweat.
- Set up that workshop in your garage.
- I'd have to clean it all out first.
You could sit here all day shooting down my ideas and drinking beer.
Wait a minute.
I think we're onto something.
Let's hear some more of those suggestions.
- Let's see, how about skydiving?
- Nah, mess up my hair.
There's a lovely young thing.
Perhaps I should just go make my move.
Yeah, go ahead and faint.
Yeah, all right.
Some of you have gotten the impression that I'm inexperienced in the ways of love.
How many women do I have to conquer to lay to rest this misconception?
One.
All right.
I wasn't going do this, but look what I got in the mail this morning.
- What does that say?
- "Inflatable Surprises Catalogue.
" My mother sent away for it.
She likes to play tricks on the cat.
This is the one I was looking for.
What's the name on there?
Lanette Cahill.
The Orange Blossom Motel.
Cliffy, who's this?
Some damsel in Florida who I had a delightful affair with while visiting.
Poor thing.
She just keeps begging me to come back to her.
We're not falling for any of this.
Why don't you believe that Cliff had an affair in Florida?
- What?
- I believe him.
I mean she could have been drunk, blind, just out prison - Thank you.
- Carla, you got a customer.
Thanks.
Honey, what is it?
Is it the baby?
- Baby, hot water, Sam.
- What's going' on?
- What?
What happened?
- It's her.
It's the Evil One.
- Where?
What?
- Over there at table five.
- The little old lady?
- Drusilla Dimeglio.
She was the principal at St. Clete's School for Wayward Girls.
We all hated her guts.
She used to do these mean, spiteful things to us.
I swore vengeance but she retired before I could do anything.
It's been 20 years.
Are you sure it's her?
There's one way to make sure.
She has my teeth mark on her left ankle.
- Go check it out, Sam.
- OK, all right.
- What am I going for?
- I can't do it.
She'll recognise me and then I'll lose her.
Come on, you got do this for me.
Why don't I just ask her name?
That would arouse suspicion.
Crawl over there and look at her ankle.
Much better.
No, I am not going anywhere.
Go wait on her yourself.
All right, I will.
You all just watch and see what happens when she gets a look at me.
- What will you have?
- I'll have gin and grapefruit juice.
She doesn't recognise me.
That means that I can take my time and work out my plan for revenge.
- She did have a mark on her ankle?
- Mark, schmark.
It must have healed.
I'll think of something slow and hideous.
- I have a suggestion.
- What?
- Do nothing.
- With the body?
No, I'm telling you to turn the other cheek.
Mooning her isn't enough.
I want to hurt her.
We haven't had any heat for hours.
What can you recommend that's nice and hot?
Speaking.
Must you inject sex into even the simplest of conversations?
I didn't want you to go without it while you were in Europe.
- I want for nothing in Europe.
- I'm sure that's what you're getting.
You know what I mean.
In fact, I think I see my shushing hunk skiing down the mountain right now.
Yes, that's Frasier.
He's able to ski right down to the back door of our chalet.
Sam, I have to go.
I'll call you right back.
- Thank you, good people of the Alps.
- Bravo, bravo.
Thank you.
Give me a minute here.
That's quite a hill, isn't it?
- You were magnificent.
Magnificent.
- That was exhilarating.
It worries me.
These risks you're taking.
Some men live their lives avoiding danger.
Frasier W. Crane seeks it.
Frasier, let me put these away for you so we can both get off our feet.
You just relax and make yourself comfortable.
Tonight is your night.
That's the spirit.
The capper of all time was when we glued Sister Scholastica to the radiator.
Who could forget the Frying Nun?
Those were the good old days.
Life was simple then.
You two started packing it away at lunch when I said I was paying.
Me and the kid was just trying to keep up with her quadruplets.
I've already got six more than I can handle.
- You have only five kids.
- I'm including my husband, Al.
Who, if he touches me again, is dead.
Four mugs and a pitcher for me and my pals from St. Clete's.
You know something?
I envy all of you.
Sure, I'm the one with the education, the money and the career, but I'd trade my electrolysis license in for a family.
Mine's available.
By the way, I can get rid of that little Fu Manchu you're starting there.
Man of my dreams.
- Sorry, I can't take them anywhere.
- It's all right.
Four beers for the lynch mob.
Sorry.
I didn't mean to ruin your wonderful surprise there.
Don't go away.
Casanova, any new letters from your Florida conquest?
Well, as a matter of fact, I did receive one today.
Each one gets more heart-rendering than the last.
She tells me she'd give it all up just for my kiss.
She must mean her lunch.
- All right, wise guy.
- Come on, let's go shoot some pool.
Good idea, Normie.
You're lucky I used up my aggressive male hormones with frequent sex.
OK.
We're all here.
Now you can tell us what this is about.
I am glad you're sitting down because you are not going to believe this.
I didn't believe it myself.
I've found Dimeglio.
- Our principal from St. Clete's?
- I heard she passed away.
Hell wouldn't take her.
She comes in every night at seven, sits at this table and has a gin and grapefruit.
- And she will be here again tonight.
- So what?
So what?
This is our chance to pay her back for all those things she did to us.
Carla, that was 20 years ago.
We were just girls.
But we took an oath that we'd get her.
Don't you remember?
She's coming.
Get behind the bar.
- Carla, come on.
- Get behind the bar.
Don't worry.
All the hate's going to come back as soon as you look at her.
- Hey, ladies.
- Get down.
- Hi.
- Hello.
Would you take this table?
That one's taken.
- What are you going to have?
- Gin and grapefruit juice.
- One gin and grapefruit.
- Coming up.
He liked your order and I'm going to get it.
What do you think?
That's not her.
She was a lot taller.
We were shorter.
I don't think so either.
She was two times as big as that.
She lost weight.
She's wearing contacts instead of glasses.
That's her.
I swear it.
It's been a long time, but I don't think it's her either.
- So what if it is?
Who cares?
- Get down!
I care.
If you don't want to help me, I'll get her without you.
- Fine.
'Cause I don't want any part of it.
- Desert me.
Just stay there because I don't want her to see you.
- What are we supposed to do here?
- Find some way of amusing yourselves.
OK.
Carla's been moping around 'cause none of her chums will back her up on this.
She's got so much anger bottled up, I'm afraid she's going to hurt someone.
And without you here, I'm next in line.
Sam, it would never come to that.
Carla has a means of dealing with anger that's very effective.
She vents it in small doses to prevent a build-up that might erupt in violence.
It's a technique that many hot-tempered, uneducated people evolve instinctively and though it's primitive it is as effective as more sophisticated techniques cultivated by better-educated people with gentler tempers Stop that, damn it.
Please, just until I'm finished.
Certainly, dearest heart.
Thank you, love of my life.
I'm sorry.
What was I saying?
You don't know either?
We must have a rule.
When you speak at least one of us has to be listening.
- Give my best to Frasier.
Bye.
- Bye.
Well, may I proceed with my labour or would my precious like to perform the task of getting heat in this place?
No, please finish, my reason for living.
You spoiled little conniving treasure.
Two beers, please.
One for me and one for my buddy, Cliff.
Cliff, the fella who's in the john without this.
The latest letter from his Florida flame.
It fell out of his pocket.
What a shame.
We should get that back to him as soon as possible.
And indeed we will, Sammy.
Just as soon as he gets out here.
In the meantime, I think it's imperative that we hold the letter thusly.
Why?
Because if you were to hold it the other way, it's an accident waiting to happen.
Witness.
I think we got a problem here.
The trick is going to be to get that letter into this envelope without reading it.
- I'm game.
- Yeah, why don't you?
- It no longer fits, Sam.
- No.
Going to have to read this.
"Dear Mr Clavin, this letter's the last one.
"If you don't respond, I will turn the matter over to my attorney.
"I will wait one week for you to pay for or return the motel towels, "ashtrays, light bulbs and shower curtain assembly, including rod, "missing from your room.
Lanette Cahill.
" - The poor guy.
- I was hoping he wasn't blowing hot air.
Interesting reading?
- I'm sorry.
- I'm more sorry.
Guys, Norm has the letter.
Hey, Steve.
Larry, Norm has the letter.
- Just knock it off.
- Is it as hot as Cliff says?
- Let's read it.
- We're not minors here.
My dearest Cliff Well, if you must.
I want you.
I want you.
I want you.
You are burning in my heart like - Like?
- I can't make this out.
Can you, Sam?
- It's volcano.
- Volcano.
I think of you at night when I go to bed and in the morning when I wake up.
And I dream about you in between when I'm sleeping.
Admittedly when most people dream.
You're quite a man, all right.
And that's for darned sure.
And you satisfy every hunger that I have as a woman.
Respectfully yours, Lanette Cahill.
Read them the P.S. where she talks about my sexual prowess in detail.
- Can't make that part out.
- Read it.
I'll help you.
This word here is gargantuan.
All right, Cliff.
We've seen quite enough.
- Good night, you guys.
- Good night.
I don't know how to thank you.
I'm just sorry I opened it in the first place.
- I'll buy you a burger.
- Listen - Good night.
- Good night, Sammy.
- There's a way to make it up to me.
- What's that?
Read me the letter again.
You know, the spicy part.
My dearest Cliffie, I want you You OK?
I can't believe they didn't recognise her.
I didn't think anybody could forget her.
Face facts, Carla.
Nobody recognised her because that's not the woman.
- But - She didn't have scars on her ankles.
That doesn't mean anything.
Criminals have their ankles altered.
- Jeez - So they can wear shorts.
You're ranting.
You're sounding irrational.
You're beginning to scare me.
I think you have to take a serious look at yourself.
Yeah, maybe you're right.
What were you going to do if it had been her?
I had this storybook fantasy when I was a little girl about someday coming up behind her and shaving her head.
I'm glad it turned out to be somebody else.
- I guess.
- Look at that, will you?
- I'm late.
- You got a date?
- Yeah.
- Go ahead.
I'll clean up.
Thank you, Carla.
I thank you and Debbie thanks you.
You're going out with Janet tonight, bean brain.
Well then Janet really thanks you.
I wanted her as much as you did.
- Good.
Someone's here.
- It's her.
- Can I help you?
- I think I dropped my wallet here.
Well, let me find it for you.
Let me see.
I got it.
- Thank you.
- Not so fast.
I have to be absolutely sure about this, you know.
- What's your name?
- Drusilla Dimeglio.
Thank you.
Do you believe in fate, Drusilla Dimeglio?
Well, I never thought about it.
Well, why don't you sit down and we'll have a little talk about it?
- I think you'll find it interesting.
- I'm kind of in a hurry.
One chair.
No waiting.
Who's back there?
Sam, is that you?
I was driving by and saw the lights still on.
- You won't believe this.
- What?
After you left, I was sitting here all by myself and guess who should walk in?
Drusie.
- Drusie?
- Yeah, Drusilla Dimeglio.
- Carla, bring me another beer.
- Coming up, Drus.
- She's back there?
- We've been playing pool all night.
- We're tight, Sam.
- So it is her?
Yeah, it's her all right.
But you know something, Sam?
After I told her I hated her, she explained to me why she was so tough on me.
She was just doing her job.
And maybe I'm a better person for it.
- Anyway, we're pals now.
- I can't believe this.
I'm so proud of you.
- This is a turning point.
- Yeah.
Maybe we've seen the last of that Tasmanian devil of a waitress.
- Bring some more pretzels, too.
- All right, right away.
That's the woman whose head you were about to shave.
I almost went through with it, too.
I came that close and I could have done it easy.
I mean, she's not as young as she used to be.
But I stopped.
God was testing me, Sam.
And I passed.
- Hello there.
Come on, it's your turn.
- Yeah, I'll be right with you.
I didn't say I got an "A", Sammy.
I just said I passed.
Rack them up.

RESCUE ME Say, aren't you Ernie Pantusso?
- Are you talking to me, sir?
- Yeah.
- Yes, I am.
- Well, I'll be damned.
- Do you remember me?
- No, I'm sorry.
I don't.
- Let me give you a hint.
- I like hints.
Shortstop.
Topeka, 1947.
My nickname was "Fancy Dan".
Joe Pitney!
No, Ernie.
I'm Dan Corelli.
Danny Corelli!
My God, am I happy to see you!
Everybody, listen up.
This is one of the most amazing men in the world.
One of the most amazing men that ever stepped into a baseball diamond.
He was a great ball-player.
I know, I played against him.
But, listen, the man is totally blind!
- I'm not blind and I never was.
- Come on, Corelli, don't be modest.
You were a legend.
You were an absolute legend.
The whole league talked about the blind man who played for Topeka.
You're all confused.
They called me the Blind Man because I sold venetian blinds door-to-door during the off season.
My God, how did he find the doorbell?
Is that an inspirational story or not?
They didn't buy your product out of pity, I'm telling you.
- I'll see you later.
- Watch the steps there, please!
I think he can see as well as we can.
Carla, in some ways, he can see more.
- Thanks for the hot tip.
- What are you talking about?
You said Vera's cousin Natalie would go out with me.
I didn't say she'd go out with you.
I said she'd go out with anyone.
I called her and she shot me down.
It doesn't make any sense.
Vera said this woman was desperate.
What did you say?
I said hello, did my icebreaker joke, and asked her out.
What was your icebreaker joke?
- A cute little pervert imitation I do.
- What?
Not pervert, more like an obscene phone call.
Heavy breathing and all.
Ma roars at it.
Hello, Natalie.
What are you wearing?
You wanna know what I'm Yeah, sure.
Tomorrow you're all gonna be using it.
Everyone raves about this place.
The chef is a genius.
I'm so glad we got a reservation.
- I want tonight to be perfect.
- It will be.
I'm gonna get the best table, no matter how many palms I have to cross.
Buona notte.
Crane, party of two.
Crane?
Ah, Crane.
- Signore, please, this way.
- Grazie.
I'd like the finest table you have.
Something quiet, near the Any place is fine.
If the food's so good, why is it empty?
I don't know.
Welcome to Luigi's.
Our world-renowned chef, Luigi, would like to welcome you personally, but he's dead.
We buried him this morning.
Is this table satisfactory?
This morning?
And you're open?
Yes.
It was one of Luigi's last wishes.
- Would it be easier on you if we left?
- No, no, no!
The new man is a very fine cook.
He studied under the world's greatest chef.
Stay.
Stay, prego.
Well, we're very hungry.
Can you recommend an appetizer?
Yes, the Calamari alla Luigi is very good.
Well, we'll have an order of that and a bottle of your best chianti.
Boy, can I show a girl a good time.
Frasier, don't feel bad.
It's not your fault.
I don't know.
The harder I try to please you, the more I mess up.
I wanted tonight to be perfect so that I could ask you to marry me.
How you talk!
Dr Marino arranged for us to marry tomorrow at his estate in Florence.
You're serious.
Well, Diane, this trip has put us to the test.
I've seen you at your best and your worst.
I didn't think your worst was all that bad.
Especially when it was only in small doses.
The more I know you, the more I want you.
Will you marry me and make me the happiest man in the world?
Frasier, I'm so nervous.
I didn't have the slightest indication this was coming.
Well, of course, my Look what I've done.
May I have your napkin?
I'll be right back.
Fancy answering machine, Sam.
Deluxe model, top of the line.
I can't talk to answering machines.
And you're such a whiz with people.
You think it's a convenience but it's a poor substitute for a human being.
- You should trash it.
- This is an expensive machine.
I'm talking about Carla.
Like to see her top that one.
Touché!
I'm not much for these things.
Why do you need one?
I've been missing calls.
People screw up messages.
We always get your messages right.
Think we're too stupid to take a message?
That hurts, Sam.
Sorry, but I think it's better to have a machine.
Does anyone know how to record on this?
You press that little red button.
Talk right into the machine.
Keep it simple.
Tell them to leave names and numbers.
I'll make jungle noises in the background.
Quiet for a second, everybody.
Hi, this is Sam Malone.
Suckered you in.
I'm not here.
Do you like talking to a machine?
At the beep, leave your name, number, and something that'll get me hot.
Hope that was for your private line.
I wouldn't waste a bon mot like that on business stuff.
- Would someone get that for me?
- Well, gee, I'll try.
Hello?
- Wanna help me, guys?
- Yeah.
Hello?
- Hello.
Come in?
- Cheers.
- Hello, it's me.
- Hold on a second.
Been dreaming about me again?
Actually, I'm calling to talk to everyone.
Chat a little.
Tell you how nice the weather's been.
How romantic Europe has been.
Yes, it's been very romantic.
The kind of place that makes a man lose his head and propose to a gal on a night such as this.
So, who do you wanna speak to next?
I'm talking about Frasier.
He had a couple of sips of chianti tonight and asked me to marry him.
Did you say a couple of sips or barrels?
- I knew you'd be this way.
- No, I'm not being any way.
So what'd you tell him?
I haven't told him anything yet.
I'm just basking in the moment.
I see.
So what's the problem?
You told me you and Frasier are a perfect match.
There's no problem.
Tell everyone that I'll call after the wedding tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
What's the rush?
Frasier has thoughtfully and romantically arranged for us to be married at the Marino estate.
It's a landmark, one of the most beautiful estates in Florence.
So are you gonna say yes?
You think I should say something else?
No.
No, you don't think I should say something else, or no, you think I should say no?
Yes.
Yes, I should say yes, or yes, I should say something else?
Congratulations.
I'm very happy for you.
I see.
If you have nothing more to say, I'd better be getting back to Frasier.
You probably want to accept before he sobers up.
- Goodbye.
- Bye-bye.
What's wrong, Sam?
Diane is gonna marry Frasier tomorrow in Florence.
Sam, free at last!
How about a little sensitivity?
He's broken up.
If Diane says she's in love with Frasier and wants to marry him, I'm happy for her.
She got what she wanted.
Maybe she called so you could talk her out of marrying him.
No, she wanted to gloat.
She wanted you to tell her you care for her.
You bet.
So that she could laugh in my face.
But I didn't fall for her little trick, so I get to laugh in her face.
Hear me?
I'm laughing.
- The man is a rock.
- From the neck up.
Hello, Diane.
I was just ordering the chef's special.
What took you so long?
Frasier, I was overwhelmed.
I needed a little time to myself.
Now I know what my answer was all along.
Yes, I'll marry you.
Diane, you've made me so happy.
Finally, something has gone right.
- Tonight is perfect.
- Yes.
I'm sorry, we tried to stay open but the people in the kitchen can't go on.
They're not taking Luigi's death as well as I am.
Please, accept our apologies.
Here is the bill.
The bill?
For what?
Sir, I'm not interested in squabbling with you on this night.
Here, are you satisfied?
Go back to Pittsburgh, USA.
Keep your money for your cowboy boots and missiles.
This place is overrated!
I do.
- Diane!
- I Diane!
Don't do this!
What the hell?
Excuse me, Father.
Sam, what on earth are you doing here?
Why are you marrying Frasier?
- I love him, of course.
- No.
No.
Look me in the eye.
Now say that.
I can't.
You love me.
Admit it.
- Now, look here - I'm sorry, Frasier.
Diane and I belong together.
I know it's nuts, but we both know it's true.
You're right.
I can't keep playing it safe, even if I get hurt.
I have to admit I love you.
I've always loved you and I always will.
- Frasier, will you forgive me?
- You know I will.
I guess I knew you two would end up together.
- You're a good man, Frasier.
- I try.
A dear, sweet, lovely man.
Be happy, Diane.
Well, Sam, I'm all yours.
Come on.
Let's go show Europe what romance means.
It's not going to be like before.
I'll make you happier than you thought possible.
I'll respect you and accept you, and I won't complain or argue or be jealous.
And I'll stop thinking the life out of everything.
I'll do all I can to make sure you enjoy life to the fullest.
If that means letting you date other women while I remain faithful to you, so be it.
Your love is worth the price.
I think this is gonna work this time.
Sam!
I'm sorry.
My mind was somewhere else.
If we don't get some beers to this crowd, they'll turn ugly.
Too late!
Does anyone know how long it takes to get to Italy from here?
OK, nobody panic!
You can make it from here to Italy in 8 hours, 37 minutes, 22 seconds.
- With a good tail wind.
- Seriously?
Unless you take the polar route.
Then you run into those convex currents created by the aurora borealis.
You're a roaring bore-ealis.
Get hold of yourself, Sam.
You're losing it.
- You have a travel agent, don't you?
- Yeah.
Cathy.
Find out of I can get onto a plane tonight to Florence.
- Bingo.
- What are you doing?
Can't you see this is a twisted cry for help?
Sammy, I'm here for you.
Knock it off.
I'm not saying I'm going.
I just wanna find out if I can.
I don't get it, Sammy.
Why Diane?
Why not arsenic or strychnine?
Let's see if I'm following this.
Carla, you think Diane is bad for Sam.
Oh, boy.
This is the craziest thing I've ever considered.
You think I should go through with this?
I think that you and Diane are lovely, special people.
Alone.
Separately.
Individually.
Together, frankly, you stink.
To the casual observer, your running off to Italy would seem stupid beyond reason.
- I'm going.
- That's what I'd do.
She'll try to change you.
You can't be something you're not.
You're a hound.
You were born a hound.
You'll always be a hound.
- You live for the hunt.
- People change.
Hounds can change.
Thank you, Cathy.
There's a flight leaving in 45 minutes, Flight 893, Captain Omar Wilkins.
Good man.
Movie is "Blame It on Rio", edited for in-flight viewing, and I recommend the chicken Diablo.
- Thank you.
- Roger, wilco.
I'm out of here.
Look at that pretty girl by the phone.
- You looked.
You know why?
- You told me to.
I'm telling you not to go.
You're not listening to that.
You looked because you're Sammy.
I don't wanna lose that guy.
- I like him a lot.
- You're not gonna lose him.
I promise.
Listen, I gotta do this.
It's not for me.
It's not for Diane.
It's for Frasier.
Nobody deserves to be married to that woman.
I'm not saying I'm gonna marry her.
I just I can't let her make this kind of mistake.
Sammy, liftoff's at 0-4-0 and counting.
I'll call you from Florence.
Talk about romantic.
If I was a woman, I'd be crying.
What would you do if you were a man?
I suppose it's possible that Diane will marry Frasier anyway.
Not a chance, come on.
No woman would turn down a man like Sammy who crossed the ocean for her.
Well, a toast to Sammy, somewhere high over the Atlantic.
Or, if he's lucky, in it.
The operator's connecting me.
Even if you get your mother, she won't be in time for the wedding.
- She'd have to be in the air already.
- I want to tell her we're getting married.
Look at that peasant woman by the tree.
Wouldn't that make a beautiful picture?
The essence of Italy.
Give your mother my love.
Please, Sam, for once in your life, have done the right thing.
Don't be at Cheers.
Be on a plane.
No, as far as I know, Paul Revere never went to Florida.
But Let me get it.
It's Sam's private line.
The machine will pick up.
Hi, this is Sam Malone.
Frasier, I've been thinking.
We're so far from Florence and we're having car trouble.
Fate is telling us something.
Why not just get married here in this little town, right now?
- Wouldn't that be romantic?
- Diane, I love that idea.
- Let's do it.
- I love you.
Are you cold, sir?
No.
No, I'm not.
I just had a chill, I guess.
- If there's anything I can do - I'm fine.
But don't go too far away.
I think I may need some assistance.
