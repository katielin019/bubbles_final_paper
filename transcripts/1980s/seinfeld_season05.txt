{START OF EPISODE 1}
How about the seedless watermelon?
What an invention.
Scientists are working on this.
Other scientists devote their lives to fighting cancer, AIDS.
These guys go, "No, I'm focusing on melon.
Oh, sure, thousands of people are dying needlessly but this, that's gotta stop.
You ever try and pick a wet one up off the floor?
It's almost impossible.
I'm devoting my life to that".
So I guess if they can get rid of the seeds, the rind is going next.
What do we need that for?
They're not gonna stop until they're making ready-to-eat fruit cups growing right out of the ground.
-So, what's her name?
-Karen.
-She nice?
-Great.
-So you like her?
-I think so.
You don't know?
I can't tell anymore.
-Well, do you feel anything?
-Feel?
What's that?
Let me ask you this.
When she comes over, you cleaning up a lot?
-Yeah.
-Straightening up or cleaning?
-Cleaning.
-You do the tub?
-Yeah.
-On your knees, Ajax -hands, scrubbing, the whole deal?
-Yeah.
Okay.
I think you're in love.
-Tub is love?
-Tub is love.
You got a nice girl and a clean apartment.
Yep.
Just one little problem.
-Sexual?
-Yeah.
Well I've never really felt confident in one particular aspect.
-Below the equator?
-Yeah.
Nobody does.
You know, nobody knows what to do.
You just close your eyes, you hope for the best.
I really think they're happy if you just make an effort.
I don't know.
Last time I got the tap.
You got the tap?
You're going along, you think everything's all right and all of a sudden you get that tap.
It's like, "All right, that's enough.
You're through".
Yeah.
-The tap is tough.
-It's like the manager coming out -and asking you for the ball.
-Yeah.
Maybe she wanted to move on to other business.
No, no, this wasn't moving on.
I got the hook.
I wish I could get a lesson in that.
It's a very complicated area.
You could go crazy trying to figure that place out.
It's a hazy mystery.
Anyway, I think everything else is okay unless, of course, she's faking.
-Who's faking?
-Nothing.
-Faking what?
-Nobody's faking.
-Orgasms?
-She's not faking.
-How do you know?
-I know.
I can tell.
It's one of my powers.
Why?
Did you ever fake?
-Of course.
-Really?
-You've faked?
-On occasion.
-And the guy never knows?
-No.
How can he not know that?
Because I was good.
I guess after that many beers, he's probably a little groggy anyway.
Well, you didn't know.
What's that?
You didn't know.
-Are you saying--?
-I think I'll have a piece of cake.
-With me?
-Well.
-You faked with me?
-Yeah.
-You faked with me?
-Yes.
-No.
You faked it?
-Yes.
I faked it.
That whole thing, the whole production, it was all an act?
Not bad, huh?
What about the breathing, the panting, the moaning, the screaming?
Fake, fake, fake, fake.
I'm stunned.
I'm shocked.
How many times did you do this?
-All the time.
-All the time?
I think I'll have a chocolate malted here.
But I'm so good.
I'm sure you are.
Jerry, listen, it wasn't you.
I just didn't have them back then.
She faked.
-Maybe they've all been faking.
-I'm sure they're not.
Maybe Karen is faking.
-She was probably joking.
-No, no.
It was no joke.
-She didn't have any?
-No, none.
-She faked them all?
-Faked them all.
Well, so she faked them.
So what?
The woman had an orgasm under false pretenses.
That's sexual perjury.
You know, I heard her screaming from my apartment.
She woke me up a few times.
How did she do it?
She's like Meryl Streep, this woman.
And I know how to work the equipment.
I'm not unskilled, I'm in the union.
I mean, if she'd told me, maybe I could have done something.
Yeah, I could've helped you out.
-What could you have done?
-I could've given you some pointers.
I know how to press those buttons, buddy.
Well, I'm feeling very inadequate about the whole thing.
Don't: I'm supposed to do something with her later.
I don't even wanna see her.
Hello?
Oh, hello, Elaine.
So we having dinner tonight?
I don't know.
I'm not really in the mood.
Why?
What's wrong?
You're not still thinking about earlier, are you?
What, the grilled cheese?
No, they always burn the toast.
No, the other thing.
Oh, that.
Well.
Oh, come on, Jerry.
You're making too much of a big deal about it.
-I guess.
So you wanna meet at 7:30?
-Okay.
-All right.
Bye.
-All right, see you later.
Bye.
Renee, can you come here a second?
Let me ask you something.
Have you ever, you know -faked it?
-Yeah, sometimes.
-Really, like when?
-lf we went to a Broadway show -if we had really good seats.
-Yeah, well.
You know, if it's enough already, and I just wanna get some sleep.
-I really don't feel like seeing her.
-You know, I faked it.
-What?
-Yeah.
-You faked it?
-Yeah.
-Why would you do that?
-Well, you know if it's enough already, and I just wanna get some sleep.
Yeah, but why would you--?
-Bad peach?
-It's terrible!
-Did you get that at Joe's?
-Of course I got it at Joe's.
Surprising.
His fruit's usually the best.
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna return this.
-You're returning used fruit?
-Jerry, this peach is subpar.
-So, what do you want me to do?
-I want restitution.
Restitution?
You want restitution?
-Why should I give you restitution?
-It's no good.
-Once I put it out, it ends for me.
-It's still your fruit.
-You gotta stand behind your fruit.
-I stand behind my fruit.
-So?
-Hey, you got a bad peach that's an act of God.
He makes the peaches.
I sell the peaches.
You got a problem, you talk to him.
You know, this whole place is goingdownhill.
I could've come in here last week with a bad plum, but I let it go.
Take your business elsewhere.
I don't want your business.
-Now you don't want my business?
-I don't.
And at this moment, you're banned from this store.
You're banned!
But what am I gonna do for fruit?
You seem like you really enjoyed your risotto.
You have a very contented air over there.
You look very contented, very satisfied.
-Are you satisfied?
-I'm very satisfied.
I'm sure if you weren't satisfied, you would say something, wouldn't you?
-I probably would.
-Sure.
But then again, I'm an enigma.
Hey, listen, instead of the movie maybe we'll go back and you know.
Maybe.
So you feel okay about that whole thing what we do in there.
You're generally okay with everything in there?
Generally.
Do you feel the way you feel after the risotto?
Well, no.
I feel full after the risotto.
Yeah.
Oh, God.
Satisfied?
Hey, you know what?
You wanna go see that new Meryl Streep movie?
-Meryl Streep?
-You don't like her?
She's okay.
God, I love her, Jerry.
She's so authentic.
You believe everything is actually happening to her.
No acting there.
-Yeah.
You don't want coffee, do you?
-I really admire actors, you know.
It's just such an incredible skill to pull that off.
Yeah, yeah.
Can we get off of this?
-What's the matter?
-Nothing.
You're not still thinking about that, are you?
-No, no.
-Oh, good.
Give me another shot.
-What?
-Another shot.
I want another shot.
-You mean?
-Yes.
-Oh, no.
I don't think so.
-Come on.
One shot.
I could do it.
I know I could do it.
Jerry, we're friends.
We can't do that.
It would ruin our friendship.
Oh, friendship.
Friendship, schmiendship.
-No, that's important to me.
-We won't ruin the friendship.
-Yes, we will.
-Elaine.
No, Jerry, it is out of the question.
You know what sex does to a friendship.
It kills it.
Half-hour.
Give me a half-hour.
-No.
-Okay, 1 5 minutes.
I guarantee you, 1 5 minutes, I can make it happen.
No.
You're worried I'll be able to do it, aren't you?
No, it doesn't matter.
Jerry, I don't care.
No, that's it.
That's it.
You like having this over me.
-You don't want me to do it.
-That is so ridiculous.
-Come on, Elaine!
-No.
-Elaine.
-No!
-It's Jerry's fault.
-Jerry?
Jerry and Elaine.
They made me nuts.
Oh, I don't care, George.
Really, it's all right.
So you feel okay?
Well, it's not like after the risotto.
Well, good night.
I still don't understand why we had to walk out on that movie.
Oh, that Meryl Streep, she's such a phony baloney.
Good night.
Thanks for a really fabulous evening.
-Oh, what, you're upset?
-Yes, I'm upset.
Can't you tell?
No, I can't.
Maybe you're faking.
I'm really, really sorry I told you that.
-I'm sorry too.
-Well, stop being such a baby.
-You're a baby!
-You're a baby!
It's all your fault.
You and Elaine, all that orgasm talk.
She did have an orgasm, she didn't.
Orgasm this, orgasm that.
I got so focused on it.
I started to panic andI lost it.
I tried everything.
I was talking to him.
"Please wake up.
Do something".
They're mysterious little fellows, aren't they?
I hate him.
You know, it happens to everybody.
Happened to Houdini.
And he could get out of a trunk with his hands in chains.
But he had a problem with that.
-The miracle is that it ever happens.
-It's like a magic trick.
Sometimes I think it would be easier to bend a spoon mentally than to make that transformation.
-Hey.
-Hey.
Listen if I give you money, will you go out and get me some fruit?
-Why can't you get it?
-Well, I got banned from the store.
I can't go back in there now.
-What happened?
-We had a fight over the peach and Joe doesn't want my business.
-Hey, is that a joke about Houdini?
-No.
-I told you not to say anything.
-What am I gonna do for fruit?
-You'll have to go to the supermarket.
-The supermarket?
Impossible.
They don't have a decent piece of fruit at the supermarket.
The apples are mealy.
The oranges are dry.
I don't know what's going on with the papayas.
You gotta go to Joe's.
You gotta get me some fruit.
So, what, am I gonna buy all your fruit now?
Well, if Houdini couldn't do it, what chance do I have?
Hello?
Oh, hi, Patty.
Thanks for calling me back.
I wanted to ask a question.
When we were going out did you have orgasms?
Okay.
Thanks.
No, that's it.
Yeah.
Okay, bye.
Patty Lawrence had them.
-I'll make you a fruit list, all right?
-Yeah.
Hello, Elaine?
Patty Lawrence had orgasms.
What do you think about that?
And I got calls in to six other women.
I bet they confirm an orgasm too.
So, what do you have to say now, Elaine?
Hello?
-I feel like I'm doing something wrong.
-All right, now here's the list.
All this?
It's too much.
-What do you need five mangoes for?
-I like mangoes.
Avocado?
I don't know how to pick out an avocado.
-Well, they gotta be soft.
-How soft?
But not too soft.
See, better too hard than too soft.
I'm not going through this every week.
I'll you that right now.
What are these, plums?
What is that?
Yeah.
Now, get the ones that are red on the inside.
How do I know what they look like inside?
What do they look like on the outside?
-Oh, and get some plantains.
-Plantains?
-Yes.
-What's a plantain?
It's in the banana family.
It's a delicacy.
You're not getting any plantains.
-Hey, Joe.
-How's it going?
Good.
Just getting some fruit for myself.
Gotta have fruit in the house.
I like it as a snack.
Wholesome natural, chock-full of vitamins.
All right, let's see.
Mangoes.
Four plums with red on the inside.
An avocado.
Just right.
And three plantains ought to do it.
-All right, just hold it right there.
-What?
This fruit isn't for you.
-What are you talking about?
-You think I don't know, huh?
Mangoes, plantains, plums with the red on the inside?
That's Kramer.
-I can't buy mangoes and plantains?
-All right, get out.
-You're making a big mistake, Joe.
-I don't want your business either.
-Are you banning me from the store?
-That's exactly what I'm saying.
-I'm banned?
-You're banned.
-All right, where do you want it?
-Put it over there.
Yes.
-This stuff is heavy.
-Oh, great.
What do you got?
Look at these.
These mangoes are beautiful.
Oh, those are beautiful.
You did good.
-Yeah, yeah.
-Yeah.
-All right, I gotta get going.
-What are you doing?
I got a date with Karen.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
There's nothing happening down there.
You're thinking about too much, putting too much emphasis on it.
I knew this was gonna happen someday.
It was inevitable.
I've known it ever since I was a little kid.
I've been waiting for it.
This mango is delicious.
That reminds me.
I'm not getting you guys any more fruit.
That guy was eyeballing me the whole time.
Gave me the creeps.
All right, you owe me 28.60.
Gee, sorry, I don't have any cash.
I only got hundreds.
You see, l-- I knew it.
Come on, we're gonna pay you.
Have some mango.
-I don't want any mango.
-Come on, take some.
It's good.
Yeah.
It's very good.
Juicy.
Ripe.
Boy, this Joe's got some terrific fruit.
What?
I feel like I got a B1 2 shot.
-This is like a taste explosion.
-I told you.
What is it?
I think it moved.
Oh, my God.
I think it moved.
Here, give me the big piece.
-I'll see you later.
-Hey, George.
I'm back, baby!
I'm back!
-Do you want some mango?
-No, thanks.
Well, well.
If it isn't the first lady of the American theater.
What brings you here?
Just gonna return some of your things that were in my house.
And I've got some things of yours here.
-I know.
-Well, I'll get them.
-I'm waiting.
-All right then.
-You got my fins?
-Yeah, I got your fins.
-Do you have my poker chips?
-I got your poker chips.
-You got my goggles?
-They're next to the fins.
-You got my cards?
-They're next to the poker chips.
All right.
-Guess that just about does it.
-I guess.
-Okay, well, see you around.
-Yeah, see you.
All right, let's go.
I'll give you half an hour.
-What?
-Come on.
-Are you serious?
-Look, Jerry we have to have sex to save the friendship.
Sex to save the friendship.
Well, if we have to, we have to.
Oh, George.
Please, it's not necessary.
What's not necessary?
The little extra moan you threw in there.
Laying it on a bit thick, don't you think?
-What are you talking about?
-What am I talking about?
Come on.
You don't think I bought all that.
-Bought what?
-No, you're very good.
Very good with the moanings and the gyrations.
You really had me going there for a minute.
You think I was faking?
Come on.
With the, "Oh, George.
Oh, George"!
Come on.
Not that I don't appreciate the effort that was put into the performance.
I'd like you to leave.
-What?
-I said, I would like you to leave.
-Just get your clothes on and get out.
-But why?
Because I said so!
-I can't find my glasses.
-Well, hurry up.
-Let me look for my glasses.
-Get out.
Get out.
Get out.
It's all George's fault.
All that talk about impotence, it got to me.
And that orgasm stuff.
Orgasm this and orgasm that.
It's a lot of pressure.
I'm a little hungry.
You wouldn't happen to have any of that mango left?
The female orgasm, it's kind of like the Batcave.
Very few people know where it is.
And if you're lucky enough to see it you probably don't know how you got there and you can't find your way back after you leave.
There are two types of female orgasm, the real and the fake.
And I'll tell you right now, as a man, we don't know.
We do not know.
Because to men, sex is like a car accident and determining the female orgasm is like being asked: "What did you see after the car went out of control"?
"I heard a lot of screeching sounds.
I remember I was facing the wrong way at one point.
And in the end, my body was thrown clear".
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
I stay up late.
I'm "night guy".
Night guy wants to stay up late.
"Getting up after five hours' sleep"?
"That's morning guy's problem.
That's not my problem.
I'm night guy.
I stay up as late as I want".
So you get up in the morning, you're exhausted, groggy.
"Oh, I hate that night guy"!
See, night guy always screws morning guy.
There's nothing morning guy can do.
The only thing morning guy can do is oversleep so that day guy loses his job and night guy has no money to go out.
Do you ever spit on anybody from here?
No.
You?
No.
-Do you ever think about it?
-Yeah.
Me too.
-Hey.
-Hey.
-Well, I got it.
-You got me the air conditioner?
-What do you think?
-Beautiful.
What air conditioner?
My buddy works in an appliance store.
He got us 30 percent off.
-Is it a good one?
-Good one?
It's a Commando 8.
-Commando 8?
-Twelve thousand BTUs.
You hate air conditioning.
You've never had an air conditioner.
-But Amy likes air conditioning.
-Oh, an air conditioner for Amy.
Amy doesn't like the temperature up here.
She's a little hot.
-All right.
-Okay.
So.
-I'm gonna measure the window up.
-Yeah.
Yeah.
Rock on!
I gotta get out of this city.
So you're tunneling to the center of the Earth?
I'm at the health club.
And while I'm in the pool, some guy walks off with my glasses.
Who steals prescription glasses?
-You don't have an old pair?
-I broke them playing basketball.
He was running from a bee.
Now if I wanna see anything, I gotta wear these.
George, those are prescription goggles?
What is there to see in a health club pool?
There's a lot of change down there.
When I find that guy, this much I vow: Those glasses will be returned to their rightful owner.
We're behind you, Aquaboy.
Godspeed.
What kind of a sick, demented person wants another person's glasses?
Yeah, especially those frames.
You know what you ought to do?
Go see Dwayne at J&T Optical.
He'll give you 30 percent off.
Yeah.
Come on.
Hey, he just got me 30 percent off on an air conditioner.
-Really?
-Retail is for suckers.
-What do I have to do?
-Just mention my name.
-That's it?
-That's it.
What about these?
They look good.
I liked the other one too.
I've liked about five of them.
Well, it's a tough decision.
I have to wear these every day.
-I'm deciding on a new face.
-Come on, George.
Pick a face and go with it.
Now, those look good.
They're very bold.
Yes, they are bold.
Jerry, what do you think?
These women would be good-Iooking if they weren't wearing glasses.
Hi there, little doggy.
-Do you mind if I pet your dog?
-It's okay with me.
Hi, little doggy.
You can't have that dog in here.
-You okay?
Did he bite you?
-Can you believe that guy?
I'm okay.
It's just a nip.
He just walked away.
And once again I'm standing here like a little man.
Well, not this time.
You!
Dog man!
-My leg looks pretty bad.
-I'll take you to the emergency room.
-Okay.
-Hey.
Any luck?
Did you catch him?
No.
No.
-I'll take Elaine to the hospital.
-Good, good.
Do that.
-What's the matter?
-Oh, no.
Nothing.
What is it?
I can't tell you.
-Jerry, can we go?
-Yeah, yeah.
In a second.
-You can't tell me?
-I can't tell you.
-Don't ask.
-I'm asking.
-Jerry, my leg.
-Yeah, here.
Take care of it.
Come on, George.
What is it?
I saw Amy making out with your cousin Jeffrey.
-What?
-They were right outside.
-Amy and Jeffrey?
-Yes.
-Are you sure?
-Yes.
Positive.
But you can't see.
There's no lenses in those frames.
I know.
I was squinting.
Jerry, you just catch up with me.
You can just follow the trail of blood.
We're gonna have to talk about this later.
Thank you.
Taxi!
Excuse me.
What do you think of these?
We just got those in.
It's a very exciting new frame.
Yes, it is exciting.
This is gonna be my new face.
-Do you have a prescription?
-Yeah.
Kramer.
What?
Kramer.
-What about him?
-You do know Kramer.
-Yes.
-Well, I'm mentioning his name.
Why?
Because, you know.
No, I don't know.
Look, I'm gonna need a deposit on these.
Oh, come on.
Cousin Jeffrey?
-It's not possible.
-Why not?
They could've met.
She loves the park.
He works for the Parks Department.
Jerry, that is so ridiculous.
George didn't even have his glasses on.
But he was squinting.
So what?
Squinting doesn't make that much of a difference.
Are you kidding?
I've seen him squint.
He can squint his way down to like 20-30 vision.
Once we drove down from the Catskills and he lost his glasses.
He squinted his way from Wurtsboro down to the Tappan Zee Bridge.
He was spotting raccoons on the road.
-Okay.
-Okay?
That's it?
I don't need a shot?
No shot.
Dog bite.
No, I know I wasn't shot.
Do I need a shot?
Not shot.
Dog bite.
Woof-woof.
Not bang-bang.
-Look at this.
The cable's out.
-That's okay.
-We don't have to watch TV.
-No, no.
No trouble at all.
It's the principle of the thing.
I like them to know that I know what's going on that they're not getting away with anything.
I'm on hold.
So, what did you do yesterday?
-Yesterday?
-Yeah.
You remember yesterday.
Beautiful day.
Good day to be out.
-I didn't do anything.
-Well, you must've done something.
-No.
Nothing really.
-Didn't go out of the house?
Didn't take a walk on Columbus Avenue?
-Well, I did go out for a little while.
-Well.
Your day's getting more interesting already.
Oh, see?
Told me they'd be back in a minute, and they lied.
-You can't trust anyone.
-No, you can't.
Well, let's cut the bull, sister!
I know about you swapping spit with somebody on Columbus.
-What are you talking about?
-Look, my friend saw you.
Saw me?
With who?
You tell me.
There's nothing to tell.
There isn't?
No.
All right.
Wanna get some pizza?
I had a feeling this was too good to be true.
-Why?
-There had to be another side to you.
-No, there's no side.
-There is a side, an ugly side.
No, no ugly side.
-Look, I think I'm gonna go.
-Why?
-It's really hot in here.
-So we can still go out on Friday?
Yeah.
When are you getting an air conditioner?
It's coming.
It's a Commando 8, 1 2,000 BTUs.
It's gonna be like a meat locker in here.
-I was an idiot for listening to you.
-Hey, I saw what I saw.
Everything was going so well.
She hadn't seen any flaws in me.
-Now she sees a side.
-What side?
-A bad side, an ugly side.
-So what?
I wasn't planning on showing that side for another six months.
You made me throw off the whole learning curve.
-Why don't you just ask Jeffrey.
-He'd just deny it.
-There must be some way to find out.
-Amy said nothing happened.
You're taking her word over mine?
I'm your best friend.
But you're blind as a bat.
I was squinting!
Remember that drive from Wurtsboro?
I was spotting those raccoons.
They were mailboxes, you idiot.
I didn't have the heart to tell you.
Hey, look.
A dime.
Mercury head.
-You mind?
-No, keep it.
What happened?
You buzzed five minutes ago.
There was a dog in front, and it spooked me.
-I couldn't come in until he left.
-A little white dog?
-Yeah.
-Snowball?
You're afraid of Snowball?
I'm afraid of dogs now.
He's like a squirrel.
Well, he frightened me.
-Did you get the shot?
-No.
He said I didn't need a shot.
You got bit by a strange dog, and you didn't get a shot?
You think I should have?
Just go back to the optical store and ask Dwayne if he knows the dog's owner.
Good idea.
I'm gonna do that.
The AC's on its way.
Pardon me.
I went to see your friend Dwayne.
There was no discount.
-What?
-That's right.
No discount.
-Did you mention my name?
-Yes, I mentioned your name.
-And?
-Bupkis.
I don't believe this.
That guy owes me big time.
I got him off sugar!
I'm gonna go down there with you right now.
All right, let me just grab an apple.
-Kramer, Elaine's afraid of Snowball.
-Little Snowball?
He runs on batteries.
You know, George that's an onion.
Yes, it is.
He couldn't tell an apple from an onion and he's your eyewitness.
I saw them making out.
You can believe it.
I don't know what to believe.
Eating onions, spotting dimes.
I don't know what the hell is going on!
Look, all you gotta do is get Amy and Jeffrey together somewhere.
-That's it.
-Hey, wait a second.
I'm going over to Jeffrey's tomorrow to pick up these Paul Simon tickets.
I'm gonna surprise Amy.
All I gotta do is bring her with me.
Then when Jeffrey opens the door, it's Howdy Doody time.
Right this way, Mr. Doody.
You'll see.
I'm right.
-Hey, Dwayney.
-Hello, Kramer.
-What is going on here?
-What are you talking about?
I'm talking about the 30 percent discount.
Excuse me.
-A man came in here-- -Don't interrupt, they're discounting.
Who said anything about a discount?
Oh, how quickly we forget.
-You owe me, buddy.
-For what?
-Remember this?
-What are you doing?
You were eating four of those for breakfast and chasing it with a Ring Ding and two Butterfingers on the train.
-Sound familiar?
-Put that away.
Remember when I found you at Dinky Doughnuts?
You were all hopped up on cinnamon swirls!
They wouldn't serve you anymore.
You wouldn't have teeth if it wasn't for me taking you to Joe's fruit stand and stuffing cantaloupe down your throat.
But so much for gratitude.
Yeah!
Yeah!
All right!
All right!
I'll give him the discount.
Just put that thing away!
But this squares us.
-Could I just have the name--?
-Out!
We'll see you, Dwayne.
I don't know what to tell you, Elton.
Listen to this.
This is not good.
Listen to these symptoms for rabies: Anxiety.
Irritability.
I've got those.
I'm irritable.
-Who picked these out?
-I did.
They're ladies' glasses.
All you need is a chain so you can wear them while playing canasta.
Elaine was supposed to help me.
Hey, I got bit by a dog!
I had to go to the hospital!
I was bleeding to death!
I can't solve every problem you have!
Hey, hey.
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
Commando 8 has arrived!
-I'll get the window.
-Twelve thousand BTUs of raw cooling power.
Yeah.
Installed.
That's it?
You don't have to screw it in?
No.
Just plug it in, and the Commando 8 does the rest.
-I'll seal it up later.
-Yeah.
-Just in time for Amy.
-When are you gonna execute that?
Oh, God.
I've got such a headache.
Oh, that's another symptom.
-Of what?
-Rabies.
That's fatal.
You don't want that.
I know I don't want it.
I don't need you to tell me what I don't want you stupid hipster doofus!
Hey, hey, what is this?
What's going on here?
I'm sorry, Kramer.
I'm sorry.
No, it's all right.
I had a friend who had rabies once.
May I have one of those, madam?
Madam?
What are you calling me madam for?
They're ladies' glasses.
Look, see?
It's right here.
"Gloria Vanderbilt Collection".
He sold me ladies' glasses!
I. I think I'm-- I'm having trouble swallowing.
l-- I can't swallow.
She's got rabies, just like my friend Bob Sacamano.
Look at that, she's delirious.
She's foaming at the mouth!
-Is this gonna hurt?
-Yes, very much.
-What if Jeffrey's not home?
-He'll be home.
Friday night, the big night on the Nature Channel.
Let me tell you something.
There is no way cousin Jeffrey's dating Amy.
-He looks like a horse.
-He does look like a horse.
Yeah, he's got a real horse face.
Hey, look at this.
It's the guy with the dog.
Hey!
Hey, you, down there!
Remember me?
!
I had to get shots because of your stupid dog!
Who are you calling stupid?
-Hey, should we spit on him?
-No, no.
Come on.
Let's go down.
The air conditioner!
I think it got the dog!
Oh, boy.
Excuse me.
I'm new here.
Would you mind walking me back to my locker?
Sure, why not.
There you go.
-Hey, that's the guy.
-What guy?
The guy that stole my glasses.
This time I got him!
-Could you pick it up a little?
-Where the hell are we going?
He's getting on a bus.
Damn.
Those are nice glasses.
I don't like them.
They pinch my nose.
Is that right?
My friend and I would like to exchange frames.
Could you put his lenses in my frames and mine in his?
Yeah, we can do that.
Excuse me one second.
And I'd like a discount.
Why should I?
You're lucky I'm not asking for a whole refund.
You gave me ladies' frames.
What's that about ladies' frames?
Say, I'm trying to track down that lady that was in here the other day.
Well, she's trying to track you down.
Well, I would love to talk with her.
-She lives on 81 st Street, right?
-That's Jerry.
Really?
You wouldn't happen to know what apartment he's in?
Yeah, 5A.
Thanks a lot.
-What are we doing here?
-Oh, you'll find out.
I don't know.
You're acting very mysteriously.
Well, I'm very mysterious by nature.
-A lot of women find that attractive.
-I find it annoying.
Hello!
-Uncle Leo.
-Come on in.
-This is Amy.
-Hello, Amy.
-What are you doing here?
-Jeffrey went out tonight.
Very convenient.
I'm supposed to tape this nature show for him.
He loves nature, botany, zoology.
You know, his botany teacher from college stays in close touch with him.
-They became friends.
-Really?
That's pretty rare!
I mean, actual friends!
Like equals.
They have dinner together, discussions.
Uncle Leo, did he leave any tickets here for me?
Oh, yeah.
I'll get them.
Thank you.
-What tickets?
-The Paul Simon "Concert in the Park".
-We're going to the concert?
-That's right, lady.
-What a great surprise!
-I thought you'd like that.
So that's why you've been acting so mysteriously.
Now you know.
That and that alone is the reason.
You know Jeffrey's favorite animal?
The leopard.
-Why is that?
-He likes the spots.
-Oh, here's the tickets.
-Thank you.
Oh, he asked me to give you a message.
He said that he's very sorry, and he hopes you'll forgive him.
So it's true!
You were making out with him.
What are you talking about?
I don't know Jeffrey.
So this is why you brought me up here.
Very convincing, but it's not gonna work this time.
What are you talking about?
All he meant was that he was sorry that the seats aren't very good.
Wanna get some pizza?
-Boy, these really do pinch the nose.
-Tough luck.
A deal's a deal.
Oh, my God.
It is them.
I still don't know how you spotted that dime.
I think you planted it.
Plus, I gotta pay that vet bill for the stupid dog.
I don't know how that guy got my name.
Yeah.
Boy, these really do pinch.
If I ever find the son of a bitch that stole my glasses.
When did glasses go from being this carefully crafted apparatus to just this mall impulse item?
"Honey, I'm going out for yogurt and trifocals.
Need anything"?
"Glasses in a about an hour".
"How much"?
"Seventy-five bucks".
"Well, here's 72.
It's about 75".
What, you're trying to coordinate with the one-hour photo place?
"Hurry up!
Give me the glasses.
My pictures are coming.
I need to see"!
Then they have those Woolworth glasses.
They're there.
They're there now.
No exam.
You don't have any idea what's wrong.
And the glasses are made up.
They're ready and waiting.
"Thank you".
You just walk into a wall.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
There's no way that moving in with your parents is a sign that your life is right on track.
There's no way that you could fake this even.
"Things are great.
I met a terrific girl, I got a great job and if everything goes according to plan I'm gonna be moving back in with my parents soon".
It's like getting busted on a parole violation and thrown back into the slammer.
"In the opinion of the board, you need further rehabilitation, I'm afraid".
And you go back into that little room of yours, you feel so huge.
It's like you could take your bed and just crush it in your hands.
You can hold your parents between your fingers.
"Why was I so afraid of you people when I was growing up"?
-I can't believe this.
-It won't be for that long.
How can I do this?
How can I move back in with those people?
Please, tell me.
They're insane, you know that.
Hey, my parents are as crazy as your parents.
How can you compare your parents to mine?
My father has never thrown anything out ever.
My father wears his sneakers in the pool.
Sneakers.
My mother has never set foot in a natural body of water.
Listen carefully.
My mother has never laughed.
Ever.
Not a giggle, not a chuckle, not a tee-hee.
Never went, "Ha".
-A smirk?
-Maybe.
-And I'm moving back in there.
-I'll lend you the money for the rent.
No, no, no.
Borrowing money from a friend is like having sex.
It just completely changes the relationship.
-Hey.
-Hey.
All right, I'm ready.
I still don't understand.
Why do you want to move back with your parents?
I don't want to.
I'm out of money.
I got $ 7 1 4 in the bank.
-Well, move in here.
-What's that?
Why doesn't he just move in here?
Yeah, I'll move in with him.
He doesn't let you use the toilet.
You can move in with me if you want.
Thank you.
I. That might not work out.
Careful.
Careful with the suitcases.
We just painted.
-Hello, Mrs. Costanza.
-Hello, Kramer.
-Close the door.
-I gotta bring in more stuff.
-More stuff?
How much is there?
-There's more.
-So how are you, Jerry?
-Fine, Mrs. Costanza.
-Hey, I got a terrific joke for you.
-I'm not interested.
No, no.
It's really funny.
-There's these two guy-- -Tell it to the audience.
Here, I made some bologna sandwiches.
Bologna?
Nobody eats bologna anymore.
What are you talking about?
Have a sandwich.
-No, thanks.
-Oh, stop it.
-You don't want one, Kramer?
-No, thanks.
I think you're all a little touched in the head.
You're so worried about your health?
You're young men.
-I really don't eat it.
-What will I do with these sandwiches?
Will you take them home, give them to someone in your building?
I don't feel comfortable handing out bologna sandwiches in the building.
-All right.
That's it.
Anything else?
-No, that's it.
-I gotta go move the car.
-Well, I guess we'll be going.
-What, you're going?
-Yeah.
Well, what are you doing later?
Elaine and I are having dinner with Kramer and his new girlfriend.
-Really?
-Yeah.
You can't believe this woman.
She's one of these low-talkers.
You can't hear a word.
You're always going, "Excuse me?
What was that"?
-Maybe I'll meet you.
-No, George.
We're going out to eat tonight with your father.
Okay.
-I'll talk to you later.
-Yeah, take it easy.
Oh, my God.
-Yeah?
-I had this idea for a pizza place -where you make your own pie.
-Right.
-You remember?
-That was a good one.
Well.
-What's that?
-Excuse me?
-Yeah?
Yeah.
-Yeah.
Yeah.
You know that Leslie's in the clothing business?
She's a designer.
She's come up with a new one that'll be the big new look in men's fashions.
It's, like, a puffy shirt.
Well, yeah, it's all puffy.
Like the pirates used to wear.
-Oh, a puffy shirt.
-Puffy.
Yeah.
See, I think people wanna look like pirates.
It's the right time for it.
To be all puffy and devil-may-care, you know.
Yeah.
That's true.
I'll be right back.
Jerry's gonna be on the Today show on Friday.
-Yeah, that's right.
-Yep.
He's promoting a benefit for Goodwill.
You know, they clothe the poor and the homeless.
-And the indigent.
-And the indigent, yeah.
I do volunteer work for them.
I set the whole thing up and got Jerry to do it.
-Sure.
Yeah.
-Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Yep.
Yep.
Yep, yep.
Maybe you should take a civil-service test.
-I'm not taking a civil-service test.
-Look at this, George.
You ever seen a silver dollar?
Yes, I've seen a silver dollar.
Why don't you wanna take a civil-service test?
To do what?
Work in the post office?
Is that what you want me to do?
Would you believe when I was 1 8 I had a silver-dollar collection?
I don't understand.
You get job security.
-You get a paycheck every week.
-I'm a college graduate.
You want me to be a mailman?
You know, I couldn't bring myself to spend one of these.
I got some kind of a phobia.
-So, what are you gonna do?
-I don't know.
I do know that I have some kind of a talent, something to offer.
I just don't know what it is yet.
I bet that collection would be worth a lot of money today.
Oh, my God.
I don't like this waiter.
Look at him.
He sees us.
Doesn't wanna come over.
I need some air.
-George, where you going?
-I got a lot of thinking to do.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm terribly sorry.
Look what you've done.
You've spilled my bag.
-Here, let me help you.
-No, no.
It's all right.
It's just that I'm here with my parents and my mother wants me to take a civil-service test and to tell you the truth, I don't even think I'd pass it.
What?
-Your hands.
-What about them?
They're quite exquisite.
They are?
Extraordinary.
Have you ever done any hand modeling?
Hand modeling?
No.
Here's my card.
Why don't you give me a call?
I don't get it.
Me neither.
-What is it?
-I don't know.
-They're hands.
-This woman set me up for a job.
Well, what about my hands?
I don't see how your hands are any better than my hands.
What, are you kidding?
The knuckles are all out of proportion.
You got hair there.
Where do you get off comparing your hands to mine?
This is a one-in-a-million hand.
That's what comes from avoiding manual labor your whole life.
This is it.
It's happened to me, Jerry.
I was sitting in the restaurant, the two nutjobs were talking.
I couldn't take it anymore.
I get up from the table, andI bop into this woman.
It's just like in the movies.
-Hey.
-Hey.
-Hey, George.
-Hey.
-Are you crazy?
!
Are you crazy?
!
-What?
What?
-You could've damaged my hands!
-What?
It's just a toy.
George has become a hand model.
-A hand model?
-Yes.
Really?
Let me see your hands.
You can look at them, but do not touch them.
Let's see.
Oh, those are nice.
You know, I never noticed this before.
They're smooth.
Creamy.
Delicate yet masculine.
All right.
I gotta get going.
Oven mitts?
It's all I could find.
-Would you mind getting the door?
-All right.
-Thank you very much.
-Yep.
You won't believe what's up with Leslie.
Since you agreed to wear the puffy shirt on Today she's getting all these orders from boutiques and department stores.
Since I what?
-Agreed to wear the puffy shirt.
-What are you talking about?
You said that you would agree to wear the puffy shirt on the Today show.
-This?
-Yeah.
-I agreed to wear this?
-Yeah, yeah.
Well, when did I do that?
When we went to dinner the other night.
What, are you crazy?
What were you talking about when I went to the bathroom?
I don't know.
I couldn't understand a word she said.
-I was just nodding.
-There you go.
Where I go?
You mean she was asking me to wear this ridiculous shirt -on national TV, and I said yes?
-Yes, yes.
You said it.
I didn't know what she was talking about.
I couldn't hear her.
-Well, she asked you.
-I can't wear this puffy shirt on TV.
I mean, look at it.
It looks ridiculous.
Well, you gotta wear it now.
All those stores are stocking it based on the condition you'll wear this on the show.
The factory in New Jersey is already making them.
They're making these?
Yes, yes.
This pirate trend she's come up with, Jerry.
This is gonna be the new look for the '90s.
You're gonna be the first pirate.
But I don't wanna be a pirate.
I knew it.
I knew it.
I always knew you had beautiful hands.
I used to tell people-- Frank, didn't I use to talk about his hands?
Who the hell did you ever mention his hands to?
I mentioned his hands to plenty of people.
You never mentioned them to me.
Hand me an emery board.
I always talk about your hands, how they're so soft and milky white.
-No, you never said milky white.
-I said milky white!
Scissor.
Don't hand them to me with the point facing out!
-I'm sorry.
-You're sorry?
I'll try to be more careful.
I hope so.
Georgie-- Georgie, would you like some Jell-O?
Why'd you put the bananas in there?
-George likes the bananas!
-So let him have bananas on the side!
All right, please.
Please, I cannot have this constant bickering.
Stress is very damaging to the epidermis.
I have an important photo session in the morning.
My hands have got to be in tiptop shape.
So, please, keep the television down and the conversation to a minimum.
But, Georgie, what about the Jell-O?
I'll take it in my room.
Yeah, come in.
Wanted to let you know he's got five minutes.
Yep, yep.
Jerry, five minutes.
Now, that's a great-Iooking shirt.
Aye, captain.
Yeah.
See, I'm glad I ironed it.
It's perfect.
Look at it.
It's fantastic.
Kramer, how am I gonna wear this?
I can't wear this.
Hey, this looks better than anything you own.
In two months' time, everybody's gonna be wearing the pirate look.
-Yeah.
-Hi, Kramer.
I just saw Bryant Gumbel.
-He said he might help at the benefit.
-Great.
-What is that?
-It's the puffy shirt.
Look at it, huh?
What do you think?
Is it cool or what?
-Why are you wearing this now?
-Why am I wearing it now?
I'll tell you why I'm wearing it now.
Because the low-talker asked me to, that's why.
And I said yes.
Do you know why?
Because I couldn't hear her.
When did she--?
When did she ask you this?
At dinner, when Kramer went to the bathroom.
-I didn't hear anything.
-Of course not!
Nobody hears anything when this woman speaks.
Well, you can't wear that on the show.
-Elaine, you wanna stop it?
-What--?
What?
No, Jerry, you are promoting a benefit to clothe homeless people.
You can't come out dressed like that.
You're all puffed up.
You look like the Count of Monte Cristo.
I have to wear it.
The woman has orders for this shirt -based on me wearing it on TV.
-Yeah.
They're producing them as we speak.
Yeah, but you're supposed to be a compassionate person that cares about poor people.
You look like you're gonna swing in on a chandelier.
Okay, let's go.
Is that what you're wearing?
I've never seen hands like these before.
They're so soft and milky white.
You know whose hands they remind me of?
Ray McKigney.
-Ray.
-He was it.
Who was he?
The most exquisite hands you've ever seen.
Oh, he had it all.
What happened to him?
Tragic story, I'm afraid.
He could've had any woman in the world but none could match the beauty of his own hand.
And that became his one true love.
-You mean.
-Yes.
He was not master of his domain.
-But how?
-The muscles became so strained with overuse that eventually the hand locked into a deformed position and he was left with nothing but a claw.
He traveled the world seeking a cure.
Acupuncturists, herbalists, swamis.
Nothing helped.
Towards the end, his hands became so frozen he was unable to manipulate utensils and was dependent on Cub Scouts to feed him.
I hadn't seen another pair of hands like Ray McKigney's until today.
You are his successor.
I only hope you have a little more self-control.
You don't have to worry about me.
I won a contest.
Okay, let's get to work.
Back now, 7:46.
On Tuesday the 1 9th, here in New York there'll be a benefit for Goodwill Industries a used-clothing organization that provides services to the needy.
One of the performers will be Jerry Seinfeld.
-Jerry, good morning.
-Thank you, Bryant.
Speaking of clothing, that is a very, very unusual shirt you have on.
Yeah.
You're all kind of-- Kind of puffed up.
-Yeah, it's a puffy shirt.
-You look kind of like a pirate.
Like a pirate.
Anyway, you know, we're hoping to raise enough money-- Do you know--?
You know-- Look, I'm sorry, it is just a very unusual shirt.
It could be a whole new look for you.
You could put a patch over an eye.
-You could be the pirate comedian.
-Yeah.
-Will you wear the puffy shirt at the--?
-Look, it's not my shirt.
-Whose shirt is it?
-What's the difference?
I agreed to wear it.
It's a puffy shirt.
I feel ridiculous in it.
I think it's the stupidest shirt I've ever seen, to be perfectly honest with you.
You bastard!
-Did you hear that?
-That I heard.
All right, a little to the left.
Little higher.
Good, perfect.
-Like that?
-Just like that.
Hold it.
Good.
Okay, let me get one more.
One more.
Good.
That's it.
You're done.
-That's it?
-That's it.
And here's your check.
Thank you very much.
It was an honor.
Thank you.
It was great working with you.
Your hands are beautiful.
Thank you very much.
You know, I was wondering if you're not doing anything later, maybe you'd like to get together.
You ruined me!
You ruined my career!
Oh, just keep your voice down, everyone can hear you.
Well, I don't give a damn!
If you talked this loud to begin with, I wouldn't be in this costume.
Hey, hey.
You can't believe this.
Look at this check.
They said I had the most beautiful hands they ever saw except for this McKigney guy.
This girl gave me her number.
I got it all.
I'm busting.
Jerry, I'm busting.
I've never noticed your hands before, let me see.
All right.
Yeah.
Real nice.
Nice shirt.
What is this?
Is this what you wore on the show?
-Yeah.
-Have you completely lost your mind?
-Hey.
-Who's dressing you?
You look like a complete idiot.
I wouldn't wipe my-- -You ready?
-Yeah.
Hot, hot.
-I'm sorry.
-McKigney had a few good years.
How do you forget to turn off an iron?
I was excited Jerry was putting on the puffy shirt.
My whole life is ruined because of the puffy shirt.
It didn't do me any good either.
That benefit was the worst show I ever did.
Some of those heckles were really uncalled for.
"Avast ye, matey"?
What the hell does that mean?
"Twenty degrees off the starboard side.
It's a Spanish galleon".
There's no comeback for that.
Well, it got me fired from the benefit committee.
You know, all those stores canceled out on her.
She's finished.
-We're finished.
-Really?
What happened?
I just can't be with someone whose life is in complete disarray.
-What happened to all the shirts?
-They gave them to Goodwill.
Puffy shirt.
Puffy shirt.
Can you spare a little change for an old buccaneer?
You know, it's really not a bad-Iooking shirt.
Why do we always have to say, "Excuse me" when we can't hear what someone's saying?
Why are we so guilty and so--?
"Excuse me.
Pardon me.
I'm sorry".
Why can't, just once, I go: "Nope.
Not loud enough"?
Why can't I do that?
Just once I would like to have the guts you know, to make that judgment.
Someone mumbles something, and you go, "Your fault.
I'm not sorry, because it's your fault".
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 5}
At a hospital, the treatment is to lie in a bed.
Whatever's wrong with a human being, lie down.
Doctor never says, "Well, your condition isn't as bad as we thought.
We want you to kind of lean against a doorjamb for seven to 1 0 days.
See how that feels".
Always a bed.
Unless you go to the emergency room then it's a chair.
You've been shot, stabbed, run over: "Have a seat".
There's always an interesting cultural, ethnic mix to the hospital staff.
It's like a local news team in there.
The doctor's the anchorman.
He's got white hair, he's in charge.
The nurse is the feature reporter, you know.
You listen to her, but it's always, "And now, back to your doctor".
The orderlies come in with food and bedpans.
That's like your sports and weather.
Then the baby's head comes out, and I'm screaming.
My brother, who's videotaping, turns green.
His eyes roll up in his head, and he blacks out.
He drops the camera, the camera breaks.
And then the placenta comes flying out.
-And then a doctor says-- -Hey, thanks.
That's enough.
Will you look at that kid.
Sucking away like there's no tomorrow.
Suck, suck, suck.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Look at that, Jerry, look at that.
-Yeah, I looked.
I saw it.
-Does this make you uncomfortable?
-No, no.
Uncomfortable?
Not at all.
My friend's wife's breasts are out.
Why would I be uncomfortable?
Look at him.
-So how long do they do this?
-Year or two.
No break?
-After that comes the weaning.
-After sucking comes weaning?
-First sucking, then weaning.
-You gotta wean.
-Gotta wean.
-Must wean.
-What about that spot I got, huh?
-Yeah.
I saw the spot.
You open the door to the car you walk right into the hospital.
You can't beat that spot.
I am on a roll.
Yeah.
I'm just willing these great parking spots.
George.
Maybe the baby would like to see the spot.
A positive, uplifting message to start his life out with, huh?
You can still get a great spot in this city if you apply yourself.
Where's Kramer?
Shouldn't he be here?
-Did you give him the room number?
-Yeah, 1 39 7.
Excuse me.
Do you know where the elevator is?
Yeah, it's right around the corner there.
1 93 7.
Oh, God!
It's a pig-man.
A pig-man!
So anyway, Jerry, Elaine, we have something we wanna ask you.
You gotta look.
I pulled it in perfectly equidistant -from the car in front and behind.
-Would you shut up, George?
I'm taking a cab home.
I can't take this anymore.
You were saying, Stan.
I'm sorry about this.
Myra and I would like you and Elaine to be the godparents of Steven.
-Me?
A godfather?
-Yes.
Never go against the family, Elaine.
What?
Hey, I just saw a pig-man.
A pig-man.
He was sleeping, and then he woke up and he looked at me and he made this horrible sound, this: Kramer, what are you talking about?
I'm talking about a pig-man.
I walked in the wrong room, and there he was.
-A pig-man?
-A pig-man.
Half pig, half man.
That's great, Kramer.
Anyway, tell us what's involved in being a godparent.
Elaine, never ask me about my business.
Godfather?
The most important thing is you help with the bris.
-The bris?
-A bris?
-You mean, circumcision?
-Yeah.
I would advise against that.
Kramer, it's a tradition.
So was sacrificing virgins to appease the gods -but we don't do that anymore.
-Well, maybe we should.
Hey why are all those people milling around my car?
-I don't know.
-Maybe they're admiring your spot.
-They're looking up.
-Hey, there's a guy up on the roof.
That's the guy I told where the elevator was.
Oh, God, I hope he doesn't jump-- Oh, my God!
My car!
My car!
A mohel?
What the hell is a mohel?
A mohel is the person that performs a circumcision.
Well, where am I gonna find a mohel?
Motels, models.
How do you find a mohel?
Finding a mohel's easy.
Any idiot can find a mohel.
I have to hold the baby while they do it.
That's a tough job.
How would you like that?
Hey, Jerry, you ever seen one?
-Oh, you mean, that wasn't?
-Yeah.
-No, you?
-Yeah.
What'd you think?
It had no face, no personality.
It was like a Martian.
-But, hey, you know, that's me.
-Hey.
Well, I got the estimate.
It'll cost more to repair the roof than the car is worth.
I'm going over and seeing that hospital administrator today.
Someone is gonna pay for this, and it's not gonna be me!
-Oh, you're screwed.
-I know.
Swan dives from 20 floors up, lands right on top.
What, do I got a bull's-eye up there?
He couldn't move over two feet, huh?
Land on the sidewalk, it's city property.
Well, I have to interview a mohel.
How about our little Elaine, huh?
Attended the finest schools on the eastern seaboard equestrian competitions, debutante balls.
Look at her now.
Interviewing mohels.
Yeah!
-What's the matter?
-You all right?
Don't ever question my instincts, because my instincts are honed.
-Look at that.
Look, look.
-What now?
"Hospital receives grant to conduct DNA research.
Government funds genetic research at area hospital".
Yeah, so?
Pig-man, baby, pig-man.
If I have to hear about this pig-man one more time-- Hey, I'm telling you, the pig-man is alive.
The government's been experimenting with pig-men since the '50s.
Just because the hospital's conducting DNA research doesn't mean they're creating mutant pig-men.
Jerry, will you wake up to reality?
It's a military thing.
They're probably creating a whole army of pig warriors.
I'll tell you something.
I wish there were pig-men.
Get a few pig-men walking around, suddenly I'm looking a lot better.
If someone wanted to fix me up, they could say, "At least he's no pig-man".
Believe me, there'd be plenty of women going for these pig-men.
Whatever the deformity, there's always some group attracted to it.
"That little tail really turns me on".
That's just about enough.
-This doesn't interest you?
-Oh, no, it's fascinating but could you do me a favor?
Could you tape the rest of the "pig-men and the women who love them" discussion?
And I'll listen to it the next time I'm here.
I gotta go find a mohel.
You know, you should call that off, Elaine.
It's a barbaric ritual.
Perhaps one day when the pig-men roam free, it will be stopped, Kramer.
Until then, off with their heads.
-Kramer, isn't it a question of hygiene?
-It's a myth.
Besides, it makes sex more pleasurable.
Yeah.
So how does that help me?
-George, you ever see one?
-Yeah, my roommate in college.
Yeah, what'd you think?
I got used to it.
All right, I wanna see the pig-man.
Show me the pig-man.
Don't worry, I'll show you.
And you'll never be the same.
Maybe he's just a guy with a nose like this: A lot of people have a nose like this.
They're not necessarily pig-men.
Believe me, Jerry, somewhere in this hospital the anguished oink of pig-man cries out for help.
Yeah, well, if I hear an anguished oink, I'm out of here.
I don't see any pig-men.
I see human, human, human.
-Wait a second.
-What?
Oh, it's George.
The administrator's on the third floor.
I'll meet you at the car.
Wait, George.
You got room in the car for the pig-man, huh?
The pig-man can take the bus.
George, if the pig-man had a car, he would give you a ride.
How do you know?
What if the pig-man had a two-seater?
Be realistic, George.
I'll tell you what, if pig-man shows up, we'll squeeze him in.
-I'll see you later.
-Yeah.
-Mr. Costanza, come in, come in.
-Thank you.
It's been a very trying couple of days around the hospital.
Doctors, patients, everyone just grief-stricken over this unfortunate occurrence.
Well, I join them in their grief.
Horrible thing.
Flew right past the children's wing.
All the sick children in the playroom, looking out the window just traumatized by the incident.
Apparently they thought he was flying.
You know how children are.
"Oh, look, a man is flying.
A man is flying"!
And then splat.
That's where I come in.
On "splat".
You see, Mrs. Sweedler-- Or is it Hospital Administrator Sweedler?
-Mrs. Sweedler is fine.
-Mrs. Sweedler.
Thank you very much.
You see, this tragedy has affected me in a very.
A very personal way.
-How is that?
-Yes, well, you see the deceased landed on my car.
The splat, as it were, actually occurred on the roof of my car.
Now, of course, I can't help but feel that had it been a convertible, this whole tragedy might have been averted.
But I've never really been the kind of guy to buy a convertible what with the baldness and everything.
Well, I have known bald men who owned convertibles.
They wore a hat.
Yes, but then everything's all pulled down, and it's-- Anyway.
The damage, unfortunately has marred an otherwise fine automobile rendering it virtually undrivable.
Yes, well, that is a shame.
Yes.
A shame.
That is exactly how I would put it.
Now, Mrs. Sweedler, with all due discretion and sensitivity and taking in the whole scope of the situation I just can't help but think that the hospital is somehow responsible for compensating the other still-living victim of this horrendous, horrendous tragedy.
-Mr. Costanza.
-Yes.
A man plummeted tragically to his ultimate demise -Yes.
-and you greedily, callously want to profit from it?
Well, profit.
I think you'll see from the estimate that I'm not really profiting that much.
It might be a little high, but.
Get out.
Get out now.
Get out of my office!
-Should I just leave--?
-Get out!
This is it.
Wait, excuse me.
What happened to the guy that was in there before?
-I don't know what you're talking-- -No, you know.
He had this: -He was.
-No.
-He was.
-No.
This doesn't look familiar to you?
This doesn't look familiar to you?
-Sir-- -Look, I know what's going on.
-Sir-- -Look, I know what's going on.
The oink, oink.

Yes, if you'll excuse me, I have some patients-- Yes, if you'll excuse me, I have some patients-- Listen, you little quack.
Listen, you little quack.
There was a half man, half pig in that room over there.

You're holding the baby?
-No, no.
-Hello.
Who's holding the baby?
-Who's holding the baby?

-Jerry is.
Jerry, do you wanna?
Yeah.
I'm holding the baby.
-Okay, go.

-Okay, you sit there.
Now I need the baby.
Bring me the baby.
I need the baby!
-No, I'm not gonna let them.
-What are you doing?
Come back!
People, people.
Compose yourself.
This is a bris!
We're performing a bris here, not a burlesque show.
This is not a school play.
This is not a baggy-pants farce.
This is a bris!
A sacred, ancient ceremony symbolizing the covenant between God and Abraham.
Or something.
No, don't touch anything.
Don't touch a thing.
I could have been a kosher butcher like my brother.
The money's good.
It's got a union with benefits.
And cows don't have families.
You make a mistake with a cow, you move on with your life.
Anyway.
-Hurry up, George.
Step on it!
-All right, all right.
That damn mohel!
He circumcised my finger.
-The mohel circumcised my finger.
-You flinched.
Flinched?
I did not flinch.
George, did I flinch?
Oh, how would he know?
He blacked out.
He fainted.
It was very traumatic.
Last thing I remember was you flinching.
Then everything went black.
Who's got tissues?
I need more tissues.
Look at this thing.
It's my phone finger!
-Careful.
You're getting blood all over.
-What about the baby?
The baby's fine.
They took him to the hospital as a precaution.
But look at me.
I'm the one who's hurt!
Will you stop it?
You're just gonna need a few stitches.
A few stitches?
I've never had stitches.
I'll be deformed.
I can't live with that.
Goes against my personality.
It's not me.
Hey, look at that.
Boy, are you lucky!
Another great spot in front of the hospital.
In an emergency yet!
How lucky are you, huh?
Is that unbelievable?
How unbelievable is that, huh?
Come on, give it to me.
Give it to me.
-I've never seen a mohel like that.
-That was a one-in-a-million mohel.
-I said I'm sorry.
-Look at this.
-You'll be okay.
I'll see you later, huh?
-Where is he going?
I'm gonna look for a bathroom.
Well, if it isn't Shaky the Mohel.
Nice circumcision, but it's not supposed to be a finger.
Circumcision was perfect.
That was your fault.
You flinched!
Oh, who made you a mohel?
You get your degree from a matchbook?
You see?
He flinched again.
Nice.
You picked a hell of a mohel!
One more peep, and I'll slice you like a smoked sturgeon.
-Oh, don't threaten me, butcher boy.
-Butcher boy?
Yeah, what was this?
What was this?
What was this, huh?
Careful, Jerry, the mohel's got a knife!
Hey, what's going on out here?
You should be ashamed of yourself, both of you.
-Blood.
-Oh, how's the baby?
-There's nothing wrong with the baby.
-The circumcision went fine.
Thank God the flincher didn't harm the baby.
I'll get you for this.
This is my business, my life!
No one ruins it for me, no one!
Here's my card.
Get out of my way!
I can't do it.
Look what they did to my boy.
They massacred my boy.
You really do the worst Godfather I've ever heard.
You're not even close.
Oh, that's the flicks.
It's a '76 Chevy Impala.
They stole it right in front of the hospital.
I saw the guy drive off in it.
Well, he's about 5 feet tall hairless pink complexion.
Looks like a pig.
Yeah, all right, thank you.
Thank you.
Yeah.
So any word from the pig-man?
-No.
-No.
And he's not a pig-man, is he?
No, he's not.
He's just a fat little mental patient.
Myra.
Stan.
-Don't touch him.
-What's the matter?
You're out, Jerry.
Out as godfather.
You too, Elaine.
You're both out.
-But I didn't do any-- -No buts.
We've made up our minds.
We want Kramer.
He showed us how much he cares about Steven.
Don't ever go against the family, Jerry.
Godfather.
-Godfather.
-Yes.
To me, what's really amazing, that for every job that there is in the world there's someone willing to do it.
Someone goes, "I will stand in the tunnel breathing exhaust watching the cars go by, making sure everything's okay".
Someone goes, "I will work behind the elephant with the big shovel".
Doctors go, "Yes, I will confine myself to one particularly objectionable part of the human body all day, every day.
I will do it".
I think people that are unemployed are not really unable to find work they're just easily disgusted.
"Yes, I'm starving, and my family has no clothing or shelter but I'm not cleaning that up".
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Professional tennis-- I don't understand the shushing.
Why are they always shushing?
Don't the players know that we're there?
Should we duck behind the seats so they don't see us watching them?
To me, tennis is basically just Ping-Pong and the players are standing on the table.
That's all it is.
And that goofy scoring.
You win one point, all of a sudden you're up by 1 5.
Two points, 30-Iove.
30-Iove.
Sounds like an English call girl.
"That'll be 30, love.
And could you be a little quieter next time, please"?
Are these seats unbelievable, or what?
-Hey, where's the sunblock?
-Here.
Twenty-five?
You don't have anything higher?
-What, are you on Mercury?
-I need higher.
This has PABA in it.
I need PABA-free.
-You got a problem with PABA?
-I have a problem with PABA.
-You don't even know what PABA is.
-I know enough to stay away from it.
Thirty-love.
-So you going to Todd's party?
-lf somebody else drives.
You going?
-Gwen really wants to go.
-You're bringing a date to a party?
No good?
A party's a bad date situation.
It doesn't matter who you're with.
You could be with J. Edgar Hoover.
You don't wanna sit and talk with Hoover all night.
You want to circulate.
Why'd you pick Hoover?
Is he that interesting to talk to?
Well, with the law enforcement and the cross-dressing seems like an interesting guy.
Yeah, I guess.
What can I do?
I gotta take her with me.
Todd introduced us.
I'm obligated.
That woman is absolutely stunning.
-Who, the Croat?
-No, not the Croat.
The lineswoman.
That is the most beautiful lineswoman I've ever seen.
Yeah, she's a BL.
-BL?
-Beautiful lineswoman.
I'm gonna go to the concession stand to get some real sunblock.
You want anything?
Jerry?
Jerry?
You know, I just heard the Lexington line is out.
You are kidding me.
How am I supposed to get to this meeting?
Take a car service.
We have an account.
No, forget it.
I hate those.
Every time I've taken one, the driver will not stop talking to me.
No matter how disinterested I seem, he just keeps yakking away.
Why does everything have to have a social component?
See, the stagecoach.
Now, that would've been a good situation for me.
I'm in the coach, and the driver's way up there on the stage.
You're not gonna get a cab now, Bring a magazine.
Keep your head down.
Yeah, I guess that could work.
And that is it.
Match to Ms. Natalia Baudone.
Coming up next, men's singles.
But for now, let's stop and look at our beautiful tennis-center backdrop.
Hey!
There's George.
Holy cow.
It's a scorcher.
Boy, I bet you that guy could cover a lot of court.
Hey, buddy, they got a new invention.
It's called a napkin.
Well, we'll take a station break and continue with more action.
Dag Hammarskjold Plaza, huh?
Pendant Publishing, that's books, right?
Miss?
-Pardon me?
-Books.
That's what you do?
Yeah.
Yeah, I don't read much myself.
Well, you know, besides the paper.
Yeah, a lot of people read to relax.
Not me.
You know what I do?
You know, I'm having a lot of trouble hearing you back here, so.
I said, you know what I do when I want to relax?
The jumble.
Hey, do you make a book of jumbles?
I'm gonna have to be honest with you.
I'm going deaf.
-Going deaf?
-What?
Oh, I. I'm sorry.
It can be very frustrating.
Hey, what about a hearing aid?
Am I fearing AIDS?
Oh, yeah, sure.
Who isn't?
But, you know, you gotta live your life.
No, no, no.
I said-- Forget it.
I can't take my eyes off this lineswoman.
The woman is absolutely mesmerizing.
-Boy, you are really smitten.
-I gotta talk to her.
-What do you think?
-Cold?
How you gonna do that?
You're not one of those guys.
I'll psych myself into it like those people that walk across the hot coals.
But they're not mocked and humiliated when they get to the other side.
I have to.
I won't be able to live with myself.
Wait.
Jerry, there's a bigger issue here.
If you go through that wall and become one of those guys I'll be left here on this side.
-Take me with you.
-I can't.
What are you gonna say?
I don't know.
"Hi".
You think you're going to the other side with "hi"?
You're not gonna make it.
-Base to 92, come in.
-Yeah, this is 92.
Yeah, after this, go back to the city for a 6:00 pickup.
Rightio.
The party's Hanks.
Tom Hanks.
Tom Hanks?
After me, you're picking up Tom Hanks?
I love him.
So I guess your hearing goes in and out, huh?
-Yeah.
Yes, it-- -Yeah, you know what I think?
I think you made that whole thing up.
-No, no.
l-- -Yeah, yeah.
I know your type.
You're too good to make conversation with someone like me.
Oh, God forbid you could discuss the jumbles.
But to go so far as to pretend you're almost deaf?
I mean, that is truly disgusting, miss.
And Mr. Tom Hanks-- May I say he, too, would be disgusted by your behavior.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Oh, that's nice.
That's right, ignore me.
That's real polite.
Yeah, nobody's even talking to you.
Oh, you're a big lineswoman.
Oh, like that's some kind of a cool job.
I know your type.
Think you're too good for everyone.
But it's women like you-- Oh, well-- What, are you deaf?
Bingo.
-And you're saying she's deaf?
-I'm not saying she's deaf.
She's deaf.
-Can't hear a thing.
-Can't hear a thing.
-You're gonna go out with her?
-Isn't that something?
-Hey.
-Hi.
-Yeah, you know, I know how to sign.
-Really?
When I was 8, I had a deaf cousin who lived with us for about a year.
Of course, you know, I haven't been able to do it in a while.
What is this about?
I met this deaf lineswoman at the tennis match.
You are kidding.
That is amazing.
I just took a car service from work.
To get the driver not to talk to me, I pretended I was going deaf.
-Good plan.
-It didn't work.
He caught me hearing.
All right.
It's terrible, but I'm not terrible.
-No.
-No.
No.
When I shoo squirrels away, I always say, "Get out of here".
I never, ever throw things at them and try to injure them -like other people.
-That's nice.
Yeah.
And when I see freaks in the street, I never, ever stare at them.
And yet I'm careful not to look away.
See, because I wanna make the freaks feel comfortable.
-That's nice for the freaks.
-Yeah.
I don't pouf my hair when I go to the movies so people behind me can see.
I gotta make it up to this guy.
I won't be able to live with myself.
-What can I do?
-Why don't you get him some tickets.
-Your friend works at a ticket agency.
-Yeah.
Pete.
-He can get you tickets to something.
-Really?
Like a rock concert.
Whatever you like.
-Oh, great.
Thanks, Kramer.
-Yeah.
You got it.
Hey, Jerry, do me a favor.
Next time you see that lineswoman ask her how those ball boys get those jobs.
I would love to be able to do that.
I think perhaps you've overlooked one of the key aspects of this activity.
It's ball boys, not ball men.
There are no ball men.
I think he's right.
I've never seen a ball man.
-Well, there ought to be ball men.
-All right, I'll talk to her.
You wanna be a ball man, go ahead.
Break the ball barrier.
Hey!
A friend of mine from work said she saw George at the tennis match -on TV yesterday.
-Yeah.
Yeah, me too.
He was at the snack bar eating a hot fudge sundae.
He had it all over his face.
He's wearing that chocolate on his face like a beard.
And they got in there really nice and tight, and he's: -I'm sorry, George.
-But I don't understand.
Things were going so great.
What happened?
Something must've happened.
It's not you.
It's me.
You're giving me the "it's not you, it's me" routine?
I invented "it's not you, it's me".
Nobody tells me it's them, not me.
-lf it's anybody, it's me.
-All right.
-George, it's you.
-You are damn right it's me.
-I was just trying to-- -I know what you were trying to do.
-Nobody does it better than me.
-I'm sure you do it very well.
Yes, well, unfortunately, you'll never get the chance to find out.
-But I thought things were going great.
-Yeah, so did I. -Did she say why?
-No.
She tried to give me the "it's not you, it's me" routine.
-But that's your routine.
-Yeah.
Well, apparently word's out.
Hey.
Hey, Georgie, I saw you on TV yesterday.
Really?
At the tennis match?
Yeah.
You were at the snack bar eating the hot fudge sundae.
Get out of here.
I didn't see any cameras there.
Oh, the camera wasthere.
And the announcers, they made a couple of cracks about you.
Cracks?
What were they saying?
That you had ice cream all over your face.
They were talking about how funny you looked.
Oh, my God.
Maybe Gwen saw it.
Maybe that's what did it.
Well, I'll tell you, it wasn't a pretty sight.
She must've seen me eating it on TV.
She sees you with hot fudge on your face and ends it?
-You think she'd be that superficial?
-Why not?
I would be.
Hello?
Oh, hi, Dad.
You saw him?
Really, with the ice cream?
All right, I'll talk to you later.
Bye.
-Your parents saw me on TV?
-Yeah.
This is a nightmare.
Kramer, how long was I on?
It felt like eight seconds.
One-1 000.
Two-1 000.
Three-1 000-- I heard you really inhaled that thing.
Did anyone tape it?
Can we move on?
-What?
-He thinks Gwen broke up with him because she saw him eating the ice cream on TV.
Come on.
If she's that superficial, you don't want her.
Yes, I do.
I guess you're not going to Todd's party on Friday.
Well, I can't now.
Gwen's gonna be there.
She should be the one that shouldn't go.
If a couple breaks up with plans to go to a neutral place, who withdraws?
-What's the etiquette?
-Excellent question.
I mean, I think she should withdraw.
She's the breaker.
He's the breakee.
He needs to get on with his life.
-I beg to differ.
-Really?
He's the loser.
She's the victor.
To the victor belong the spoils.
Well, I don't care.
I don't want to go anyway.
I don't wanna fight that traffic on Friday.
We can take my office's car service.
-Really?
-Yeah.
They don't know.
-All right.
I'll see you later.
-Okay.
-Hey, Georgie, you coming?
-Yeah.
"To the victor go the spoils".
What are you doing tonight?
I got a date with Laura, the lineswoman.
Why?
-What are you doing?
-I was just gonna wander the streets.
I don't want to tag along with you or anything.
You wanted to come with us?
Jerry, please.
It's very nice, but.
Where would we be going?
So I've got ice cream all over my face.
There were no napkins there.
Whoever is responsible for stocking that concession stand cost me a relationship.
-They never have napkins there.
-Let's get the check.
Is this considered signing?
Do you do this when you ask for the check?
Really?
I know a sign.
That's my first sign.
That couple is breaking up.
They're breaking up?
-How do you know?
-She reads lips.
What are they saying now?
"It's not you.
It's me".
Oh, my God.
I just had a great idea.
She could come to the party tomorrow and read Gwen's lips for me.
What?
We bring her to the party and she tells me what Gwen is saying about me.
She's not a novelty act, George that you hire out for weddings and bar mitzvahs.
Look, it's a skill, just like juggling.
She probably enjoys showing it off.
I don't know, George.
I'm not sure about this.
Would you ask her?
Just ask her.
-lf she says no, case closed.
-All right.
-Laura, George was wondering if-- -Sure.
I'll do it.
-So I really had a good time.
-Yeah, me too.
-Wanna go to the party on Friday?
-Yeah.
All right, we're taking a car service.
So we'll swing by and pick you up.
How about 6?
Six is good.
You got a problem with 6?
What?
What?
Okay, listen up, people.
There are plenty of you here, but we've only got two spots to fill.
So good luck.
Hey, pops, isn't there a better way to spend your twilight years?
Well, I may be old, but I'm spry.
The tryout lasts three and a half to four hours.
-Are you up for it?
-Oh, I'll be up for it, punk.
See, I was saying "six," but she thought I was saying "sex".
We straightened the whole thing out.
-She confused "six" with "sex"?
-Yeah.
If she can't tell "six" from "sex," how's she gonna lip read across a room?
-"Six" and "sex" are close.
-It's two completely different sounds: And: It seems like a problem.
Well, I'm not dating any other deaf women.
Hey, guess who's gonna be the new ball man for the finals?
-You're kidding.
-Yeah.
They said they never saw anybody go after balls with such gusto.
-When is that car service coming?
-Five minutes.
It's gonna pick us up, then Elaine.
Laura's gonna meet us there.
If this lip-reading thing works tonight, you know how incredible it'll be?
-It's like having Superman for a friend.
-I know.
It's like x-ray vision.
If we could just harness this power and use it for our own personal gain -there'd be no stopping us.
-Hey, hey, hey.
I hear you got some lip reader working for you.
Let me use her once.
-Can't do it, Newman.
-But, Jerry we got this new supervisor at the post office.
He's working behind glass.
They're talking about me.
They're gonna transfer me.
I know it!
Two hours.
Give me two hours.
It's not gonna happen!
All right.
All right.
All right, you go ahead.
You go ahead.
You keep it secret.
But you remember this: When you control the mail, you control information.
Just pull over right by that stop sign.
-Pardon me, sir?
-I said, pull over by the stop sign.
Oh, sorry.
You'll have to forgive me.
I can't hear a damn thing.
Went to a rock concert last night at the Garden.
My seats were right up against the speaker.
It's a heavy metal group, Metalli-something.
Ca.
-What?
-Ca.
My ears are still ringing.
Some woman's idea of a joke.
-Hey.
-Hi.
-Get out.
Get out!
-We'll never get there.
-Go on!
-Okay.
Hey!
Shut the door.
The whole idea of the car service was so I wouldn't have to fight traffic.
I know, I'm late.
Hey, now I know two signs.
"Check" and "late".
Hey, this is my friend you helped become the first ball man.
Congratulations.
She doesn't know what she's talking about.
Guys, you made it.
-Hey.
-Hey, buddy.
-Hey, Todd.
-Sorry to hear about Gwen.
Why, did she say something about why she broke up with me?
No.
Tonight will be the first chance I've had to talk to her.
Really?
Look, George, I'm friends with both of you but I can't betray her confidence by telling you anything.
I wouldn't hear of it, Todd.
It's none of my business.
But you should try and find out everything you possibly can.
In fact, I'll even stay all the way over on the other side of the room just so there's no chance of me overhearing anything.
-You are so centered.
-Hey.
I've grown up.
Oh, my God.
There she is.
Go ahead.
Go ahead.
-Let's go, let's go.
Get in position.
-What?
All right, all right.
What are they saying?
-"Hi, Gwen".
"Hi, Tide".
-High tide?
"Hi, Todd".
"You got something between your teeth".
-Where?
-No, that's what he said.
"That's interesting.
I love carrots, but I hate carrot soup.
And I hate peas, but I love pea soup".
-So do I. -This is so wild.
Can I borrow her for a few hours tomorrow?
No.
Then I'd have to lend her to everybody.
I don't envy you, Todd.
This place is gonna be a mess.
Maybe you can stick around, and we can sweep together.
"Why don't you stick around, and we can sleep together".
-What?
-"You want me to sleep with you"?
-I don't wanna sweep alone.
-He says, "I don't wanna sleep alone".
And she says-- Oh, boy.
"Love to".
All right, that's it.
You get rid of me, now the two of you are gonna sleep together?
-What?
You're crazy.
-"What?
You're crazy".
-I heard your whole conversation.
-How?
-"How"?
-I can read lips.
-You said, "Let's sleep together".
-No, I didn't.
I said "sweep".
Let's sweep together, like with a broom.
-Cleaning up.
-"Cleaning up".
Sweep?
-Yes.
Sweep.
-"Yes.
Sweep".
-Cut it.
-George says, "Cut it".
-Cut it.
-George says-- Cut it.
Would you stop signing?
!
-What?
-They said "sweep together," idiots.
Not "sleep together".
Look, I know how to sign.
My eye!
My eye!
This is really amazing, getting to see Monica Seles play in the finals.
I know.
And in the first tournament of her comeback.
Thus ends the great ball man experiment.
-You with the tennis center?
-Yeah.
Hey, how about that ball man injuring Monica Seles?
-Wasn't that something?
-I'm deaf.
I've always been a big fan of the little check move, you know?
"Can I get the check?
The check".
Unless the waiter's not too sharp.
Then you gotta total it up.
"I want the check.
" They come over, "Do you want the check"?
"No, I want to be pen pals.
Can't you see what I'm doing here?
I'm trying to be cool and impress people".
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
I had glasses when I was 1 0.
Anybody beat that?
Anybody got them younger?
-Seven.
-Seven?
Two?
Anybody born with glasses?
Come out.
Actually come out of the birth canal and go: "That was a hell of a delivery, I'll tell you that.
Can I clean these?
Does anybody have one of those little cloths?
I was just born.
They're a little.
A little smudgy".
-Fantastic.
-I told you.
How good is this?
-It's good.
-How good?
-Very good.
-I know.
They put real blueberries in this.
What kind did you get?
Coffee.
They grind up the coffee beans and put it in!
Let me test-taste that.
-And it's nonfat.
-How could this not have any fat?
-It's too good.
-You wanna taste mine?
-Oh, you wanna taste mine.
-No, I don't.
If you wanna taste mine, you don't have to offer me some of yours.
All right, let's just forget it.
Kramer's gonna clean up on this place.
-What do you mean?
-He invested in it.
-No kidding?
-We've been coming here every day.
This is so f*****g good!
Jerry!
Oh, I'm sorry.
-That's nice.
-All right.
We should get going, but I'm gonna get a little bit more, okay?
-Oh, God, look who's here.
-Who is it?
This guy from my old neighborhood, Lloyd Braun.
He's a big adviser to Mayor Dinkins.
He thinks he's so cool.
Oh, really.
Hey, George.
Hey, Lloyd!
Hey!
My friend Jerry.
So I hear you're living back home now, or something?
Yeah, there was a fire in my apartment.
A fire.
There's a lot of major chicks in this place, huh?
Something wrong with your arm?
Yeah, actually.
I bumped my elbow on a desk and injured something and now it sort of moves involuntarily.
That's a bitch, huh?
-So how are your parents doing?
-Oh, pretty good.
-This place does some business, huh?
-Yeah, this is my first time here.
Hey, she's a doll.
Hi.
-Hello.
-Elaine, this is Lloyd.
-Hi.
-Hi.
Very nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you too.
Boy, I'm really sorry I gotta run now.
-Well, take it easy, huh, George?
-Yeah, yeah.
-Bye-bye.
-Bye.
-Boy, he is really cute.
-He's a jerk.
-He's gone, George.
-All right, all right.
So there were a lot of people there?
That yogurt place-- You're gonna make a fortune.
-They're doing incredible business.
-I told you to go in on it.
-How did you know?
-Well, I tasted it at the one downtown.
It's got a remarkable texture.
You'd never know it was nonfat.
-Yeah?
-Me.
Hey, I had the show of my life last night.
-I ad-libbed, like, 1 0 new minutes.
-Yeah, but did you tape it?
-Yeah.
-Right there.
I got it.
I did this thing on the Ottoman Empire: What, was this a whole empire based on putting your feet up?
I'm telling you, I got a whole new Tonight Show here.
-Hi.
-Hey.
What's the matter?
I was having lunch and I bit down on the fork.
It's hard to believe with so much biting experience a person could still make a mistake like that.
-What?
-You're getting heavy.
-What?
-You look like you put on 5 1 0 pounds.
-Kramer!
-I'll tell you something else you're looking a little chunky yourself.
-Me?
-Yeah.
-No.
-Where's your bathroom scale?
Oh, my God!
I've gained 7 pounds!
-I've gained 8!
-I told you.
I thought I'd put on a couple, but -How did I gain 8?
-I don't get it.
I've been doing the same exercises.
I haven't been eating different.
Me either.
Wait a second.
Maybe it's that yogurt.
-No, no.
That's 1 00-percent nonfat.
-How else could this have happened?
-Maybe it's the Oreos.
-I don't eat Oreos.
You don't eat Oreos?
The way you break them open.
You're practically having sex with them.
-What about me?
-You?
You're getting old.
-Maybe your yogurt isn't so nonfat.
-Oh, guess again, tubby.
There's gotta be a way we can find that out.
There must be a kind of lab that would do that.
I've got it!
I'll call the Food and Drug Administration.
Hey, I'll tell you what, chubs.
If that yogurt has fat in it, I will put myself on an all-yogurt diet -for a week.
-Well, let's start the insanity.
Giddyup.
"Tommy Tune is a very good dancer".
You ever see Tommy Tune dance?
-No.
-I like tap-dancing.
Tap-dancing.
Anyone can tap-dance.
It's those shoes.
Are you kidding?
They practice for years, those people.
What's for supper?
Somebody's at the door.
Tommy Tune is very tall.
That helps.
It makes him lankier.
-Lloyd!
-Hello, Mrs. Costanza.
Georgie, Lloyd Braun is here.
-Hey, Lloyd!
-What are you doing here?
Well, I was just visiting my mother, so I thought I'd drop by, say hello.
Georgie, come here and say hello.
How you doing?
I hear you're a big adviser for Dinkins now.
-That's right.
Hey, George.
-Hey, Lloyd.
How's it going?
I ran into George yesterday in the city.
What's the matter with you?
So how's the arm?
-Oh, it's good.
-What's the matter with your arm?
-Nothing.
-Yeah, his arm moves like this.
Your arm moves like this?
I've never seen your arm move like this.
-Me either.
-Well, it comes and goes.
It's like some kind of a spasm.
I asked Mr. Dinkins if he knew any good orthopedists.
He said he had the best.
So I made an appointment for you.
Dr. Dekter.
Mayor Dinkins got an appointment for him?
You mentioned George's name to Mayor Dinkins?
You discussed George with the mayor of New York?
Dinkins was talking about you.
He was discussing you!
You know, Lloyd, I've been to the doctor.
-There's nothing they can do.
-Hey!
Mayor Dinkins set this up for you.
You know what kind of a doctor he must be?
All right.
All right, I'll go.
Well, that's great.
And I'll be very interested to hear the diagnosis.
Okay, well, we're coming down.
All right.
Okay.
I got a place that can analyze it.
It's in Brooklyn.
-They said they could do it?
-Yeah.
It's 45 bucks.
All right, let's go to the yogurt store and get a specimen.
-Well, I hope you're satisfied.
-What?
Every word out of my son's mouth now is f**k, f**k, f**k.
You know what he said to me five minutes ago?
"Where's my f*****g cupcake"?
Gee, I'm really sorry.
He wants to be like you because you're a comedian.
-Maybe you could talk to him.
-I'd be happy to.
Thank you.
Mary, we've been eating a lot of your husband's yogurt at the yogurt place.
Does that have any fat in it?
No f*****g way.
-It was very nice seeing you again.
-Oh, it was good seeing you.
By the way, who was that gorgeous woman I saw you with the other day?
-Just a friend of mine.
-You must mean Elaine.
-Isn't she adorable?
-She is, she is.
How about giving me her number?
You know, Lloyd, I really don't have it.
She works at Pendant Publishing.
Elaine Benes.
-Great.
Thanks a lot.
-Yeah.
-Bye-bye.
-Bye.
Oh, that Lloyd Braun, he is something, isn't he?
I wouldn't hear of it.
I said, "Nice try, granny" and I sent her to the back of the line.
Hello, Newman.
Hello, Jerry.
Say, this yogurt is really something, huh?
And it's nonfat!
I've been waiting for something like this my whole life, and it's finally here!
Hey, Seinfeld.
I'd appreciate if you'd stop using obscenities around my son, huh?
It was an accident.
I'm gonna talk to him.
I'll have a small plain vanilla in a cup to go.
-That's nonfat, right?
-That's right.
I'm on a special diet.
-The doctor said I can't have any fat.
-Yeah, well, there is no fat.
Hey, another round of strawberry for me and my friends!
-Hurry, Jerry, hurry.
-How's it doing?
Not so good.
You can't have this tested now.
It's melting.
-So what?
-It changes the molecules.
You don't know what you're talking about.
Hey, fatso, I got a 90 in biology.
You call me fatso again, you're gonna be walking back.
Hi.
I called earlier about getting the yogurt tested?
Oh, right.
Would you fill this out, please?
-Does it matter if it's melted?
-No.
-This is gonna take a couple of days.
-That's okay.
Hello there.
Hello.
Test tubes.
Cool.
-What do you got there?
-This is Mr. Giuliani's blood.
We're doing a cholesterol workup on it.
Okay, I'm done.
-It was really nice meeting you.
-Well, the pleasure's all mine.
-You can't take that chemist out.
-Why not?
Because she's like the jury.
She's gotta be sequestered.
I'm not taking her out just to influence the results.
-I think the whole thing stinks.
-It smells.
Smells bad.
-Smells really bad.
-That's enough.
-What?
-With the smells.
So he made an appointment for me to see Dinkins' doctor.
-He's just trying to humiliate me.
-Yeah.
And I have to go.
If I don't go, he'll know I'm lying.
What are you gonna do, sit in the doctor's office doing this?
He's gonna think you're a mental patient.
I don't care.
Look, Lloyd doesn't know what he's up against.
This is nothing to me.
My whole life is a lie.
-Hey.
-Hey.
So guess who called me.
-Oh, don't tell me.
Lloyd?
-We're going out tomorrow night.
All right, look, he's gonna ask you about my arm.
So just tell him I banged it against a desk and it's been moving involuntarily ever since.
I can't say that.
-Why not?
-What if I like him?
-I'm gonna start out lying to this guy?
-So you're taking his side?
No, but what if we get married?
We'll always have that between us.
Already you're marrying this guy?
-You never know.
-Believe me -you're not gonna marry him.
-What if we become a couple?
Every time we see you, you're gonna be walking around going like this?
Even you can't keep that up.
Oh, I believe he can.
-Hi.
-Hi.
-You know Jerry.
-Of course.
He's a funny f****r.
See?
Listen, Matthew, I want to explain something to you.
Now, cursing is not something that most comedians do.
-You did it.
-That's true, but it was an accident.
I haven't done it since, and I would never do it again.
If you continue cursing, you'll never become a comedian like me when you grow up.
Excuse me one second.
You know, Lloyd advises Dinkins on everything he does.
-Yeah, yeah.
Big adviser.
-He tells him what soap to use.
What the f**k are you doing, you little piece of s**t?
!
We don't want to disturb the security guard.
Where's the lights?
-How about this?
-Yeah.
A Bunsen burner.
You want a taste?
It's cappuccino.
It's delicious.
-I hear you.
-Nonfat?
Well you tell me.
Is the verdict in yet?
No.
Well this is in case there's a tie.
As far as I know, he bumped his arm into a door and it's kind of got this involuntary movement.
It's some sort of a spasm.
So, anyway, you're a big adviser to Dinkins, huh?
Yeah, yeah.
It's coming right down the wire.
Know what I would do if I was running for mayor?
One of my campaign themes would be that everybody should wear nametags to make the city friendlier.
-Nametags, huh?
-Everybody would know everybody.
It would be like a small town.
-Maybe I'll mention that to him.
-Really?
-You sure you don't want any yogurt?
-No, I'm watching my weight.
-Oh, it's nonfat.
-Yeah, so they say.
-Well, shall we go?
-Yeah, okay.
Three days he hasn't called me, and you know why?
Because he thinks I'm too fat.
-He said that?
-No.
But I saw the look on his face when he put his arm around me.
Then we went to his apartment, and I sat on one of his chairs and it broke.
And he says, "Boy, you're a lot of woman".
Hey, so hear anything on the yogurt?
-No, but I expect to hear any time.
-Well, I wouldn't get your hopes up.
-Why do you say that?
-No reason.
Did you hear about that Dinkins?
-What about him?
-You didn't hear?
He's proposing a plan where everyone in the city should wear nametags.
-Nametags?
-So people can go around saying hello to one another.
Oh, I see.
So you go, "Hey, you know who I saw wilding today?
Herb"!
He's becoming a laughingstock!
The Times has already stated it could cost him the election.
Nametags!
Hello?
Yes.
Yeah-- Oh, really?
Okay.
Thank you very much.
Bye-bye.
Well the yogurt verdict is in.
Fat!
The next morning, I woke up and it was going like this.
I can control it if I really concentrate but otherwise-- Yes, well, I'm going to have to be perfectly honest with you.
-Please, doctor.
-I've examined you I've looked at your x-rays and I find that there's absolutely nothing wrong with you.
Really?
-Nothing?
-Nothing that would indicate involuntary spasms.
Well, it's kind of a mystery, isn't it?
-No, not really.
-How so?
May I suggest the possibility that you're faking.
Faking?
What makes you think that I have time to see doctors take x-rays, make appointments when there's absolutely nothing wrong with me?
What kind of a person would do a thing like that?
I don't know what kind of person would do something like that.
Obviously a very sick person.
A very immature person.
A person who has no regard for wasting other people's valuable time.
-Goodbye.
-Now see here, doctor-- I said, goodbye.
Fine.
Jerry, come on, look.
Let's go to that yogurt store.
I've been thinking about this.
This has gotta be a massive conspiracy.
Who knows how deep it goes?
Hey, look, wait a second.
Kramer, turn that up.
Rudy Giuliani, who underwent a physical last week received some startling news today when his cholesterol count turned out to be a whopping 37 5.
What effect this will have on the minds of the voters remains to be seen.
In another development, Mayor Dinkins has fired his top adviser, Lloyd Braun, who was believed responsible for the nametag fiasco.
We now take you to Giuliani headquarters where Rudy Giuliani is about to make a statement.
It's hard to understand because I've done everything I normally do.
I've been watching my diet very carefully, I exercise regularly.
My only indulgence, I guess, would be that I eat a lot of frozen yogurt but it's nonfat.
Nonfat yogurt?
Oh, my God.
They got Giuliani, and he doesn't know it!
-Now look what you've done.
-We've gotta do something.
I'm calling Giuliani's headquarters.
Nametags!
Nametags!
What kind of an idiot thinks anybody would be interested in that idea?
I don't think it's so bad.
People should wear nametags.
Everyone would be a lot friendlier.
"Hello, Sam".
"How you doing, Joe"?
Hey, your arm.
It moved again.
I thought you said it went away.
I banged it on the desk in the doctor's office.
Quiet!
They're starting the press conference.
My campaign staff received some very disturbing information regarding the fat content in yogurt that's being sold throughout the city.
I pledge to you now that if I'm elected mayor, as my first order of business I'll appoint a special task force to investigate this matter.
I promise you, my fellow New Yorkers that Mayor Giuliani will do everything possible to cleanse the city of this falsified nonfat yogurt.
The old yogurt was so much better.
Oh, this is terrible.
-Oh, it stinks.
-Mine too.
-I got one more day.
-I can't eat this.
Hey, Jerry.
Thanks a lot.
I hope you're happy.
-It had fat in it.
It's not good for you.
-I don't care!
It was good!
I was enjoying it.
Had to interfere, couldn't leave well enough alone.
I will get even with you for this.
You can count on it.
Hey, you guys, listen to this.
Listen to this.
"Apparently some blood spilled into Mr. Giuliani's test tube causing his cholesterol count to be 1 50 points higher than was initially reported.
Ironically, the mishap, by bringing the nonfat-yogurt scandal to the public's attention probably clinched the election for the Republican.
It was the one issue which seemed to electrify the voters and swept Giuliani into office".
So in effect, the yogurt won him the election.
I wonder what actually happened in that lab.
Yeah.
Me too.
I can't eat this.
Thanks for ruining my daddy's business, you fat f**k.
There's nothing more fun than cursing when you're a kid.
I mean, it's like getting the keys to the car.
You're doing something you're not supposed to do.
And there's nothing less fun than when you're an adult and having to use those wholesome curses: Fudge!
Sugar!
Consarnit!
What the hell is "consarnit" anyway?
You stub your toe and say, "Consarnit" you might as well say, "Yippee"!
If you've been to a foreign country, the first thing you learn are the curse words.
Right?
You travel halfway around the world to experience some exotic civilization the first thing you ask is, "How do they say 'doodie' here"?
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
The old-fashioned barbershop is, unfortunately, becoming a thing of the past.
What went wrong?
First of all, he needs a $20,000 chair to make a three dollar tip.
I say, cut back on the chair, update the magazines.
Why do barbers always display that license?
There's no laws in haircutting except show every customer the back of their head.
I don't wanna see the back.
Why see something that I'm never gonna see at any other time?
When I buy pants two salesmen don't lift me up and go, "How do you like the crotch"?
If I wanted to see everything, I would've been a fly.
Well, George, we here at Sanalac like to think of ourselves as fairly progressive.
We have a small but prestigious group of clients.
A lot of people consider me small and prestigious.
That's funny, George.
-You're very quick.
-Oh, well.
I feel like I don't.
I don't have to explain every little thing to you.
You understand everything immediately.
I enjoy understanding.
I want you to have this job.
-Of course-- -Stu Zimmer's on line two.
Great.
Thanks.
I've gotta take this call.
Listen I'm really glad that you came in.
"I want you to have this job.
Of course".
-Yeah?
-That's it.
-What do you mean?
-What?
He never finished.
He got a call.
That was the end.
-"Of course" was the last thing?
-Maybe he was gonna say: "Of course, I have to check with my associates".
"I want you to have this job.
Of course, the board of directors is under indictment and will be serving time".
"I want you to have this job.
Of course, sodomy is a prerequisite".
All right.
All right.
Why don't you just call him.
He made a big deal about how I understand everything immediately.
That's what impressed him.
So if you call to ask if you have the job, you might lose it.
-lf I don't call.
-You have it, but you'll never know it.
-What kind of company?
-Rest stop supply.
Oh, good for you.
-Yeah, yeah.
-Hey.
-Hey.
-Hey.
-Shower?
-Haircut.
I'm very happy with this.
-Who'd you use?
Gino?
-Of course.
-Wouldn't let that butcher cut my hair.
-What butcher?
The uncle.
Enzo.
That's the guy Jerry uses.
I've been going to him for 1 2 years.
I can't switch.
I'd hurt his feelings.
-You never get good haircuts.
-You can get a good one today.
It's Enzo's day off.
Gino's there all by himself.
-Really?
-Yeah.
You should go get one, to look good for my bachelor auction.
What bachelor auction?
This thing where they auction off dates with bachelors for charity.
And you didn't ask me?
I could raise enough money to cure polio.
They've had a cure for polio for quite some time.
Polio?
Will you go ahead?
You need a haircut.
-Okay.
-Yeah.
-What are you all dressed up for?
-Job interview.
-Yeah?
How'd it go?
-Good.
Of course.
-Oh, Jerry!
-Hi, Enzo.
-You come for the haircut?
-No.
-Actually, I was-- -It's my day off.
But I take care of you because you my favorite customer.
You been with me for so long.
You so loyal.
Well.
-lf it's your day off-- -What's the difference?
-It takes 1 0 minutes.
-Well, it's.
Jerry, today I'm gonna do something special for you.
-I don't wanna take too much off.
-Hey, who's your barber, huh?
You tell the joke.
I cut the hair.
Gino, you've outdone yourself this time.
This is the best haircut I've ever had.
-He massacred you!
-I know.
You look like you're 5 years old.
What if I shampoo?
Sometimes a shampoo helps.
You gotta start seeing somebody else.
Get out of this relationship.
I can't.
He loves me.
He says I'm his most loyal customer.
Plus, he's on the corner.
I'd have to pass him every day when I go by.
-Well, you gotta do it.
-I can't, I can't.
I'd break his heart.
No way my Gino did that.
-It's an Enzo.
-You told me he wouldn't be there.
-So what?
-So I didn't wanna hurt his feelings.
You can't continue seeing him.
You're destroying yourself.
I'm not gonna let you.
Now, if you don't call him, I will.
No, no, Kramer, you can't do that.
I'll call Gino.
You'll see him.
We're gonna get that haircut fixed.
-I don't want you to call him.
-All right.
You're crazy.
So I still haven't heard about that job.
That's a tough one.
What are you gonna do about that?
Well, I have an idea.
-Yeah?
-I show up.
-What do you mean, you show up?
-I show up.
I pretend I have the job.
The guy's on vacation.
If I have the job, it's fine.
If I don't, by the time he comes back, I'm ensconced.
-Not bad.
-What's the worst that could happen?
You'd be embarrassed and humiliated in front of a large group of people and have to walk out in shame with your tail between your legs.
Yeah.
So?
Yeah.
I see what you mean.
I forgot who I was dealing with.
Good morning.
Morning.
Good morning.
Morning.
Hi.
Nice to see you.
How are you?
Good morning.
Good morning.
Good morning.
-How can I help you?
-The name's George Costanza.
I'm starting work here today.
I was wondering if you could -tell me where my office is?
-I wasn't aware that-- Mike.
This is George Costanza.
He's starting here today.
Welcome aboard.
Thanks, Mike.
Nice to be aboard.
I didn't know Mr. Tuttle was finished interviewing.
Oh, he was probably just getting anxious to start his vacation.
-He wants to know where his office is.
-Oh, well.
Let's see.
We've got two.
There's the big one down the hall and the small one here.
-I should ask Jack.
-Oh, leave Jack alone.
Jack's got enough problems.
-I'll just take the small office.
-Really?
Yes.
I like to feel cozy.
I have a small apartment.
I like to feel tucked in, nestled in.
Love to be nestled.
All right.
It's 808, right down there.
Meanwhile, I'll get you the Pensky file.
You can start working on that.
Yes, of course.
The Pensky file.
Can't wait to sink my teeth into that.
Wow, that Pensky.
Well, we'll straighten him out.
What do you do there all day?
They gave me the Pensky file.
-So it's a nice place to work?
-You know, I'm enjoying it very much.
I think my coworkers are really taking to me.
We're like a family.
In fact, yesterday was Grace's birthday.
She's such a sweet woman.
We had a little party with cake and champagne.
I made a toast.
What about your boss, the guy who interviewed you?
He'll be back on Monday.
-Hi.
-Hey.
How come you're wearing a hat?
I got a haircut.
Oh, yeah?
Can I see it?
There's nothing to see.
-Come on.
Let me see it.
-Forget it.
Come on.
All right.
Very good.
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
You can forget about me going to that bachelor auction.
What?
No, Jerry.
You have to go.
You know, Elaine, I'd do it, but I'm working that day.
Yeah.
Too bad.
This is the worst haircut Jerry's ever had.
You gotta fix it.
Sure.
I fix.
But you gotta make sure you no tell anybody.
He's a little crazy.
I don't know what he do if he find out I touch Jerry's hair.
So, I love that Edward Scissorhands.
That's the best movie I ever see.
Again with the Edward Scissorhands.
How can you have a hand like a scissor?
Show me one person who's got a hand like a scissor.
Hey, it's a beautiful dream.
I love to be this man.
Did you ever think about what you're going to do on the toilet?
What are you going to do on the toilet?
!
I'd like to have shoehorn hands.
-Hey.
-Hey.
-Hey.
-Okay, now listen to me.
I talked to Gino.
He'll fix the haircut.
Great.
Then you can go to the bachelor auction.
-Yeah, but-- -No buts.
His apartment tonight, 8:00.
-Can he fix it?
-I don't know.
Boy, you got a beautiful head of hair.
Well, thank you.
I bet Uncle Enzo, he tell you that all the time.
Actually, Enzo hasn't said that to me in a while.
I don't think Uncle Enzo realize what a lucky barber he is.
That's nice of you to say.
Just a second.
-Yes?
-It's your Uncle Enzo.
It's Uncle Enzo!
Quick.
Go in there.
I'll clean up.
Come on up.
Uncle Enzo, what are you doing here?
-I come to apologize.
-Apologize?
I rented the movie Edward Scissorhands.
That Johnny Depp, he make me cry.
He make me cry too.
You want something to drink?
Hey!
What's all this?
Nothing.
It's just hair.
-You do haircut in the apartment?
-No.
Pizza man was here.
Maybe some fall off.
He's going bald.
It looks very familiar.
In the one minute he worked on me, I could tell he was good.
Yeah.
Slow, gentle, attentive.
-Yeah.
-Yeah.
-Didn't I tell you?
-But Enzo picked up one of my hairs.
-Yeah?
So?
-I think he knew.
-No, he doesn't know.
-He knows my hair.
You're imagining things.
He doesn't know a thing.
-Come on.
Pull yourself together.
-Okay, okay.
What happened?
It looks the same.
He didn't get to finish.
His uncle came in.
We almost got caught!
Jerry, the auction is in a few hours.
-Take the K-Man.
-Yeah.
You can still go.
What, are you kidding?
Look at him.
He's grotesque.
-Do you think?
-Do I think?
He's repugnant.
-What would you wear?
-Whatever it takes.
See, Newman is a good customer.
Once I find a barber, I stick with him.
I almost went to barber school.
I always felt I had a talent for it.
Not everybody like Newman, so loyal.
Yeah, just the way that I was raised.
I'm special.
You know, I don't mind if somebody's funny but I no like the funny business.
I'm gonna go out for a little bit.
-I'll be right back.
-Take your time.
You happy with the haircut?
It's okay.
A little crooked.
How you like to have a free haircut for six months?
-What's the catch?
-You get me a sample of Jerry's hair.
That job sounds like it might be worth a year's free haircuts.
And a comb.
Mr. Costanza, Mr. Pensky's here to see you.
Mr. Pensky?
Of the Pensky file?
Costanza?
Arthur Pensky.
Mr. Pensky.
l-- I was just working on your file.
I was transferring the contents of the file into this flexible, accordion-style folder to-- -Where's Tuttle?
-He's on vacation.
He was on vacation the last time I dropped by.
Give me my file.
Looks like you put a lot of work into this.
Well, in college they used to call me "the little bulldog".
Yeah, you are Pensky material.
Would you ever consider coming to work directly for me?
-Really?
-You are aware-- -Mr. Costanza?
-Not now, Clarisse.
I thought Mr. Pensky should know they're towing his car.
Damn this city!
I am aware?
I am aware?
He knows.
He knows about us.
-How do you know?
-Because I know.
He's crazy.
All morning, he looking at the hair.
He staring at the hair.
-Who is it?
-It's Newman!
He was in the shop with Enzo.
He can't see me here.
Go in the bedroom.
Open the window.
You can go out the fire escape.
-What do you want?
-Could I use your bathroom?
What's wrong with yours?
-My toilet's clogged.
-You can't unclog it?
-Did you ask Kramer?
-He's out.
-Number one?
-Yes, yes.
-May I go?
-Go ahead.
-I gotta go very badly.
-Flush twice.
Thank you!
No.
Jackpot.
I don't believe this.
There's no hair in this thing.
I've never seen a person that didn't have at least one hair in a brush.
Unbelievable.
Nothing.
-All right?
-Yeah, yeah.
-I'll see you later.
-What are you doing?
I'm watching Edward Scissorhands.
Could I watch a little?
It's my favorite movie.
Yeah, all right.
-You want something to drink?
-No, no.
If you wanna watch, sit down.
You're making me nervous.
I tell you, this Scissorhands is a hell of a barber.
Gotta go.
Oh, I dropped a nickel.
Yeah.
See you, Jerry.
Did you get it?
Oh, you done good, Newman.
It was a cinch.
Where you going?
Nine hundred!
Do I hear 1 000?
Ladies, he is a Harvard graduate.
-A thousand.
-A thousand.
Okay, a thousand once.
A thousand twice.
A thousand three times.
Sold to the lucky lady in the third row.
Congratulations.
Thank you so much.
Okay, our next bachelor is number 1 2 4 on your program.
He.
He is.
He's a high school graduate.
Equi.
Equivalency.
A high school equivalency program graduate.
He's self-employed.
He's I don't know, 6'3", 1 90 pounds.
He likes fruit.
And he just got a haircut.
Kramer!
Kramer!
Okay, why don't we start the bidding.
Do I hear 5 bucks?
I don't get this Scissorhands.
Is he a superhero?
Like Green Lantern?
What's with this guy?
I'm just asking.
-Who is it?
-Enzo Manganero!
Oh, my God!
One second!
Go.
Go in the bedroom.
It was you that was at Gino's apartment the other night!
-No, I wasn't there.
-Don't lie!
I know it was you!
I get a sample of your hair.
I match them up.
Sample?
Newman.
I was there, but I was just dropping off a book.
Don't, Jerry.
So, it's true!
Yes.
Is true.
I'm gonna kill the both of you!
Mr. Tuttle!
You're back.
George.
I'm surprised to find you here.
-You are?
-I thought you'd take the larger office.
Really?
I guess I didn't make it clear when I hired you.
So where's that Pensky file?
Let's see what you've been up to all week.
Here it is.
What have you been doing all week?
You missed a lovely party for Grace.
You haven't done anything with this.
Well, bear in mind, I am in the smaller office.
I'm beginning to wonder if you understand anything.
You are aware that Pensky is interested in me.
You're not Pensky material.
Really?
Well, we'll just see about that.
Ta-ta, Tuttle.
Jerry.
George, I'm sorry I gave you the wrong impression.
What I was gonna say was: Now, you are aware that our board of directors has been indicted myself included.
We're prohibited from doing business until the investigation is completed.
So obviously we would have no use for you.
Obviously.
-Yes?
-Mr. Costanza's car is being towed.
So when are you gonna be able to go out?
Not for a while.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
With a serial killer, it's safest to be a neighbor.
They never kill the neighbor.
The neighbor survives to do the interview afterwards, right?
"He was kind of quiet".
These neighbors, they're never disturbed by the sounds of murdering.
Just stereo.
Chain saws, people screaming, fine.
Just keep the music down.
And women who fall in love with the killer.
They write to him in prison.
Here's a woman that's hard to disappoint.
She's only upset when she finds out he's stopped killing people.
And she goes: "You know, sometimes I feel like I don't even know who you are anymore".
No.
Eight years isn't such a long streak.
-It isn't?
-No.
I haven't vomited in 1 3 years.
-Get out.
-Not since June 29th, 1 980.
You remember the date?
Yes.
Because my previous vomit was also June 29th, 1 9 72.
That's why during the '80 vomit I was yelling to George: "Can you believe it?
I'm vomiting on June 29th again".
When Joel told me he hadn't thrown up in eight years -I was wondering if he was normal.
-No, Elaine, he's normal.
Your boyfriend is normal.
He just has the same name as one of the worst serial killers in history.
Oh, Jer, I gotta go.
I gotta go.
-Hi.
-Hey.
We just saw your boyfriend at a bus stop.
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.
What's his name?
-Joel.
-Joel what?
Rifkin.
-Rifkin?
Joel Rifkin?
-Yeah.
It's just a coincidence -obviously.
-Guess you better keep on his good side.
Very funny.
That's very funny.
Yeah, I wouldn't sleep with my back to him if I were you.
Yeah.
Well, that's enough of that.
Enough.
If you smell anything decaying in his car's trunk-- Look, this is my boyfriend we're talking about.
He's a gentleman.
He's good-Iooking, he's a good shaver.
And he hasn't thrown up in eight years, so just shut up about him.
Shut up!
The whole city is talking about this monster, Joel Rifkin.
And I am dating a Joel Rifkin.
-But you like your Joel Rifkin.
-Yeah.
I wish he had a different name.
Ask him to change it.
You can't ask a person to change their name.
-Why not?
-Would you change yours?
If someone asked me nicely.
I'm Claude Seinfeld.
Hey, how many people did Rifkin strangle, 1 8?
Yeah, 1 8 strangles.
You know why Rifkin was a serial killer?
Because he was adopted.
Just like Son of Sam was adopted.
So apparently, adoption leads to serial killing.
Joel and I have an extra ticket to the Giants game.
-I'll go.
-Okay.
-I'll leave a ticket for you at will call.
-Yeah!
Should I have asked George?
Hey, did you hear George got back with Karen?
-Karen?
-Risotto.
I feel full after the risotto.
-Oh, the risotto broad.
-Yeah.
He's got a good thing with her.
I'm doubling with them tonight.
-You don't like double dates.
-George does.
He feels it's a good personality showcase.
He likes a date to see him with a friend so she gets a window into his non-date personality.
I've looked through that window and screamed at him to shut the blinds.
He feels he's funnier, more relaxed.
-And you're taking?
-Jodi, the masseuse.
-Hey, did you get a massage yet?
-No.
How many times do I have to go out with her before I get a massage?
Jerry, she gives massages all day.
She doesn't want to give them on dates.
Yeah, I know.
She just wants to have sex.
So what?
It's like going to Idaho and eating carrots.
I like carrots, but I'm in Idaho, I want a potato.
So I go into this clothing store, and the saleswoman is wearing this Iow-cut thing.
So I said to her, "Can I ask you a question?
When you put on a top like that, what's your thought process?
What's going on in your mind"?
That is so funny.
-You listening to this?
-Yeah, I heard you.
Boy, my neck is killing me.
It's right in this spot.
Very tender over here.
So, what did she say?
Well, nothing.
I didn't actually say that.
You just said you said it.
Sweetheart, I was exaggerating.
I'm learning a lot about you tonight, George.
I've never seen you like this.
It's like somebody's pulling on wires back here.
It's like, you never see a really attractive woman getting a traffic ticket.
How can you say that?
My sister got a ticket last week.
Are you saying she's not attractive?
Obviously, these are not hard-and-fast rules.
Darling, the tea is getting a little cold, sweetheart.
-Can we go?
-So soon?
-Yeah.
Good seeing you again, Karen.
-Yeah.
-Nice meeting you, Karen.
-Yeah, I'll call about that massage.
-Yeah.
-Let's do this again soon.
Yeah.
-I strained my neck last night.
-Really, how?
I tried brushing my teeth by holding the brush and moving my head from side to side.
It didn't work.
So, what's the deal with your friend George?
No deal.
Why?
What was all that "attractive women not getting tickets" nonsense?
Well, he was just showcasing his non-date personality.
How can you hang out with him?
Yeah, sometimes it really makes me tense.
Did you see the way that he was eating?
Yeah, he's disgusting.
I have to tell you, I really don't like him.
-Yeah, me either.
-It's just I hate that type.
He's a bad seed.
Now, you, however, you, I like.
-What are you doing?
-What do you think I'm doing?
-So, what do you think?
-Really enjoyed it.
-Jodi's nice.
-She's very nice.
Let's discuss this later.
You think she liked me?
She seemed to like me.
-I was personable, don't you think?
-You were extremely personable.
Because I thought I picked up a little something.
I'm very good at this.
Did you pick up anything?
-I didn't pick up anything.
-The second time I sent noodles back I thought she made a face.
I didn't see a face.
I thought I saw a face.
-What is the difference?
-No difference.
I could care less.
-She's Jerry's girlfriend.
-George, instead of talking about this we could be.
You know.
So you think she liked me?
-What are you doing?
-Massaging your neck.
Of course.
Massaging.
Boning up on football?
Yeah.
Yeah.
You know what?
There are a lot of players named Deion these days.
What a cool name, Deion.
If I were gonna change my name, I'd go with Deion.
Deion Benes?
Well, as a woman, it makes no sense.
But I mean.
Well, let's say I was you.
And I decided I was gonna change my name-- For no real reason whatsoever.
Deion Rifkin.
That is so cool.
Deion Rifkin?
Well, maybe you're not the Deion type.
Okay, then let's see, let's see, what do we got?
Oh, oh, oh, O.J. O.J. Rifkin.
Oh, you don't even use a name.
It's just initials.
Oh, please, please, change your name to O.J.
It would be so great.
Elaine, what is going on?
-She stayed over?
-Yeah.
-Sex wasn't so good?
-No.
Sex was fabulous.
-So?
-I want the massage.
-Did you ask her?
-I put her hands there.
She just pulls it away immediately.
She's not into it.
-Why not?
-I guess because it's her job.
It's very frustrating.
So we had a good time, the four of us.
-Yeah.
-We all got along.
-Everyone seemed very pleasant.
-Yeah.
-What did Jodi say?
-She had a good time.
-Is that it?
-Pretty much.
She say anything about?
-What?
-No, no.
It's all right.
Great.
She had a good time.
Yeah.
-You hesitated.
-I was blowing on the coffee.
She didn't like me.
It's not like you'll be spending a lot of time with her.
So she doesn't like me?
No.
-She said that?
-Yes.
-She told you she doesn't like me?
-Yes.
-What were her exact--?
-"I don't like him".
Why didn't she like me?
-Not everybody likes everybody.
-I wasn't nice?
-You were very nice.
-I bent over backwards for that woman!
-Was it what I said about her sister?
-It has nothing to do with her.
I don't even know her sister!
But if she's getting tickets she's not that good-Iooking!
You vomited in 1 98 7.
Oh, no.
That was the dry heaves.
-Jodi.
-Hi, Jerry.
-Hey!
-What are you doing here?
-I was giving Kramer a massage.
-Kramer.
Gotta run, I have an appointment.
-Let me take your table.
-That's okay.
Please.
I love to help people.
This is what I do.
Come on, I'm going this way.
I'll see you tonight.
Hey!
I am looser than creamed corn.
Who told you to get a massage?
I haven't gotten one from her!
Oh, you don't know what you're missing, buddy.
No one hails a cab like me.
My hailing technique is unmatched.
See, I get the wrist going side to side and: Cabs are crashing into themselves to just pick me up.
All right, here we go.
Let me get the door.
Feminists aside, I know women like the door-holding.
Here we are.
Alrighty.
Good.
Okay.
Let's get together again soon.
-Say hello to your sister.
-You've never met.
Whatever.
If I wasn't involved right now, I wouldn't mind being set up.
Something tells me she's a knockout!
But first, she sets the mood perfectly with this New Age music played over ocean sounds.
Then she lays you out on this table.
And she proceeds to rub oil over your entire body.
And she rubs long and deep.
Jerry, she rubs with love.
Every muscle she touches just oozes beneath those silky, soft fingers.
You can scarcely contain yourself, buddy.
-So you had a good time, huh?
-Oh, yeah.
-Enjoyed yourself?
-Very much.
All right, now, you listen, and you listen good!
-What?
-The massages are out!
-What--?
-They're out!
-Why?
-lf I can't get one, you're not!
Wait a minute.
I need my massages.
Can't you see I'm burned out?
-I'm sorry, Kramer.
-Why, why?
Look, I paid for her!
Don't you ever talk about her like that!
-Yeah, but why?
!
-Final!
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Giants Stadium.
-Oh, you have photos in your wallet?
-Yeah.
-Why, is that weird?
-No, it's normal.
You're very normal.
You're totally normal.
-Who's this?
-That's my mother.
Oh, yeah.
I see the resemblance.
-No, there's no resemblance.
-Yeah, there is.
Right here-- Elaine, I was adopted.
Oh, that's nice.
Oh, the game's about to start.
I wonder where your friend Kramer is.
Yeah, a ticket for Kramer?
-Here it is.
I need some ID.
-Oh, yeah.
-You know, I forgot my wallet.
-Well, I can't give it to you then.
-Are you kidding me?
-I'm afraid not.
Come on, just look at me.
Now tell me I'm not Kramer.
-I'm sorry.
I need proof.
-Look, I'll drive out here tomorrow and I'll show you the ID.
I got nothing to do all day.
Neither do I. But without ID I need confirmation from the person who left the ticket.
Where's a phone?
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention, please.
Would Joel Rifkin report to the stadium office.
Joel Rifkin, telephone.
Who would be calling me here?
He's not the murderer.
Oh, God.
-What's the matter with you?
-Jerry, I need another massage.
You just had one.
What do you need another one for?
Because of the Giant game.
I told you, it went overtime.
You know those seats.
They're very unforgiving.
-Oh, please.
-And then the game-winning field goal went over the net and into the crowd, and I dove over three rows.
My back, it's killing me.
It's killing me, Jerry!
-Well, did you get the ball?
-Oh, I got the ball.
I never caught a foul ball at a baseball game.
Well, it's quite a thrill.
-Well, get somebody else.
-Nobody does it like she does.
-She's the best.
-Tonight's the night.
I'm getting one.
No ifs, ands or buts.
-Well, what about my massage?
-Ask Newman.
So I lugged that table, that big, heavy massage table all the way down to the cab!
-You ever see one of those things?
-Of course.
Well, I don't know.
Maybe you haven't.
You know.
Not everybody's seen a massage table.
You think I've never had a massage?
Anyway, I don't even get a thank you.
I don't get it.
George, frankly, I'm getting a little tired of hearing about her.
I wanna know what I did to this woman.
You got a little thing for her?
No, no.
She's going out with a friend of mine.
It's only courteous to try and like each other.
What's the difference?
Who cares if she doesn't like you.
Does everybody in the world have to like you?
Yes.
Yes.
Everybody has to like me.
I must be liked.
Of course I support your decision to change your name.
After the Giant game, I realized that this problem isn't going away.
Well, listen, I just want you to know that I was more than willing to stick it out with Joel Rifkin.
Sure.
-Okay, you got your list?
-Yeah, yeah.
Ten names.
-Great.
-Okay, and if somebody objects -you can just veto it.
-Okay.
Okay, you start.
What's your first choice?
-Stuart.
-No.
Second choice.
Stuart's no good?
I have never met a normal guy named Stuart.
Okay.
My second choice is Todd.
Todd.
No.
Veto.
All right.
Hey, I think you're gonna like my third choice.
-Oh, great.
-Alex.
I gotta tell you, I have a bad association with the name Alex.
-Bad association?
-In college, I sat next to an Alex in art history.
He always drank coffee and after every sip, he would go: I mean, every two seconds: And he would take, like, 40 sips, and after every one: I had to drop the class.
-Hey.
-Hi.
I was running late, and I didn't have a chance to drop off my stuff before I came over.
Oh, no problem.
That's fine.
What's with this music?
It's New Age music.
Sounds of the forest.
I find it soothing.
Look at this.
What do you know?
A massage table.
This is great.
-What are you doing?
-Just checking it out.
Look at how this thing is made.
Can I tell you something?
That's a hell of a piece of equipment.
-Actually, I should get a new one.
-Nonsense.
This one's fine.
-So where do you wanna go?
-Go?
Why go anywhere?
That feels good.
Yeah, that's.
That's good.
Yeah, that's nice.
That's very nice.
No.
No, this isn't good.
I can't do this.
Why?
What's wrong?
-I can't.
-No.
Yes, you can.
-No, I can't.
-Yes.
Come on, I know it's something you wanna do.
You know what?
I should go talk to her.
Nothing confrontational.
Just two adults sitting down trying to clear the air.
I know if I could spend some time alone with her.
-I've got to.
I've got to.
-You're going now?
Well, I think I can still catch her.
All right, George, I have had just about enough of this.
-What are you talking about?
-I am talking about you and Jodi.
You're completely obsessed with her.
I know.
I know.
Who is more important to you, her or me?
I like you, she doesn't.
Who you gonna pick?
I'm sorry, Karen.
I care for you but I can't stand when someone doesn't like me.
-Well, now I hate you!
-That, I'm used to.
-Ned?
-What is wrong with Ned?
Ned's a guy who buys irregular underwear.
Next.
-Ellis.
-Ellis?
You might as well go with Alex.
-It's the same thing.
-Ellis and Alex aren't even close.
-Next!
-Oh, what's the point?
-Now, no, come on!
-Okay.
Okay.
Remy.
Remy Rifkin?
Should I get a beret?
Oh, Stuart's a lot better.
Little Stuart Rifkin likes to go shopping with his mother.
What do you mean, no?
No means no.
Who you kidding?
You come to my apartment with your table and your little oils.
I'm not supposed to expect anything?
You're a massage teaser.
Listen, I massage who I want when I want.
I don't submit to forcible massage.
-I'm getting out of here.
-Fine, go.
Jerry, could you excuse us for a few minutes, please?
-What for?
-We need to talk.
-You need to talk?
-We have nothing to talk about.
Look, it's no secret what's going on between us.
She doesn't like me.
Now, Jerry, if you don't mind.
George, anything you have to say to her, you can say in front of me.
Jerry this woman hates me so much I'm starting to like her.
-What?
-She just dislikes me so much it's irresistible.
-I can see that.
-I'm getting out of here.
-Don't call me.
-Don't worry.
A woman that hates me this much comes along once in a lifetime.
You're a lucky guy.
I gotta go after her.
George.
I wouldn't push for the massage.
Jodi!
Swedes are big massagers.
They like Swedish meatballs, Swedish massage.
They like having meat in their hands, these people.
But it's weird.
They have a high suicide rate.
They're always rubbing each other's necks.
For a neutral country, they seem kind of tense.
I don't like the idea of a professional massage.
I don't want people touching me that don't wanna have sex with me.
You get me all loosened up, juices flowing, then: "That's it.
Okay, you're done".
Like having chocolate rubbed over your face.
You wanna go, "Excuse me.
I think you missed a spot".
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
You can tell the best year of your father's life.
Because they freeze that clothing style and just ride it out to the end.
It's not like they don't continue shopping.
It's just they somehow manage to find new old clothes.
Every father is like this fashion time capsule.
It's like they should be on a pedestal with someone next to them going, "This was 1 965".
To me, the worst thing is shopping for pants.
I hate undressing in the little room.
What men need is a place to shop where you go in check your pants at the door and walk around in your underwear.
That would be best.
Then you'd really have to lie to the salesman.
"Need some help"?
"No, just getting some air".
How would you describe the smell in this house?
Dandruff?
Yeah, that's part of it.
Kasha?
-There's some kasha.
-Yeah.
Dandruff, kasha, mothballs cheap carpeting.
It's potpourri, really.
-All right, let's go.
Come on.
-You're going?
Yeah.
We shouldn't have bowled that last game.
I'm gonna be late.
These aren't candies, are they?
Did you use those?
These are guest soaps.
Well, I'm a guest.
Now my parents are gonna know I had people over.
You're not allowed?
I can't have any parties while they're out of town.
This is a party?
Not anymore.
Come on, get your ball.
We're leaving.
Let's go.
-Who put this cup on the new table?
-I was having coffee.
-I put it on the coffee table.
-But you didn't use a coaster!
You left a stain!
Whoa, boy, there's always one at every party, huh?
Come on.
-What's the big rush?
-I'm having people over.
-Who?
-The girls, for poker night.
You know, Joanne, Renee, Winona-- Winona's gonna be there?
Yeah.
And she broke up with the vitamin guy.
-Really?
-I'll put in a good word for you.
Thanks.
Because I would really like-- -All right!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
-This not coming out.
-Just put a coffee-table book over it.
-My parents don't read.
They'll wonder what a book is doing on the table.
Hey.
You know what would make a great coffee-table book?
A coffee-table book about coffee tables.
Get it?
-Got it.
Come on, let's go.
-Wait.
Not so fast.
Jerry, you gotta take me to get this thing refinished.
-Now?
-Yes, now.
It'll take a few days and my parents will be back.
I gotta have it before then.
Jerry, you promised you'd get me home by 7.
-We'll take the subway.
-That'll get you home in time.
-The subway?
From Queens?
-Jerry, I'm gonna get my coat.
I'm sorry, Elaine, I'll make it up to you.
I need something to read on the subway.
-Here, read this.
-TV Guide?
Like a history of coffee tables.
Celebrities and their coffee tables.
It's a natural.
This is a story that must be told.
So you're gonna talk to your boss about it, huh?
-First thing in the morning.
-Yes indeed.
-Next stop, Queensborough Plaza.
-Queensborough Plaza.
This stop is famous for its gyros.
You want one?
How will you get something and get back on the train in time?
Well, they got a stand right out on the platform.
The gyros are cooked, wrapped and ready to go.
Three dollars, no change.
-You want one?
-No, thanks.
All right.
But no bites.
Highlighter?
-Excuse me?
-To highlight the programs you plan to watch.
-Look, really, I'm just trying to read.
-Fine, okay.
It's just I've never seen a beautiful lady reading the Guide so far away from a TV.
You must really like television.
Elaine!
Guess your boyfriend will have to catch the next train.
-He's not my boyfriend.
-He's not?
Interesting.
Maybe I should get Elaine something.
-Why?
-Well, I didn't drive her home.
Plus, I give her a gift in front of Winona -how does that hurt me?
-Can't hurt you.
What about this thing?
The Indian?
Yeah, you know, kind of a peace offering.
It's cute.
Well, I can have the table ready for you on Monday.
All right, but no later.
My parents are coming back.
They left you home alone, huh?
Okay, see, on this particular Tuesday you could have watched six hours of Lucy.
There's I Love Lucy The Lucy Show Here's Lucy.
It's my stop.
Bye-bye.
Hey, miss, you forgot this.
They don't make these anymore.
The work is all done by hand.
It takes years and years.
Sylvia.
For crying out loud, you're 45 minutes late.
Yeah, yeah.
Is that your car out there?
-No, it's his.
-Oh, nice.
You guys are obviously from Manhattan.
Well, he is.
I live around the corner.
Really?
I didn't think any cool guys lived in this neighborhood.
Well, they do now.
The neighborhood's changing.
-All right, I'll take it.
-Smart choice.
You bought the Indian?
Oh, you guys have great taste.
Well, we're collectors.
We see objects of great beauty and we must have them.
Bluffed you out, jack.
Pair of deuces.
-Who is it?
-It's Jerry.
-Jerry.
-Surprise!
What is this?
Well, I felt bad about this afternoon, so I got you something.
Oh, you did?
Do you guys all know Jerry?
-Hi, Jerry.
-Hi.
Hi, Winona.
Nice to see you again.
-Elaine, is it your birthday?
-No.
I don't need a reason to give gifts.
It's my nature.
I love to make people happy.
Oh, that is so sweet.
-Are you ready?
-Yeah.
It's a cigar-store Indian.
Read the card.
That's very nice.
Thank you very much.
-Read it out loud.
-I don't think so.
We had a little fight this afternoon.
"Let's bury the hatchet.
We smokem peace pipe".
You know, it's late.
I really should go.
I don't blame you, Winona.
l-- Are you out of your mind?
It's kitschy.
Winona is a Native American.
She is?
You've got very unusual taste.
I hope prune juice is all right.
-It's the only thing that was chilled.
-Oh, that's fine.
I'm sorry about that lock on the liquor cabinet.
The combination must have just flown out of my head.
It's a mental block.
Is this your son in the bubble bath?
No, that's me.
You don't see too many guys your age who keep baby pictures of themselves around.
I like it.
It's consistent with the rest of the house.
Yes, it is consistent.
I've tried to maintain a consistent feel throughout the house.
-What is this we're listening to?
-The Ray Conniff Singers.
What's that smell?
Kasha?
It's a potpourri.
May I?
May I show you the master bedroom?
-Who is it?
-Winona, it's Jerry Seinfeld.
Yeah?
Listen, I really felt bad about what happened.
I'd really like to apologize.
Could I come up?
I'll come down.
-I came by to get my ball.
-It's right over there.
Yeah, thanks.
Yeah, it's got the magic grip.
How do you think I bowled that 220 today, huh?
Yo.
-Where did this come from?
-Do you want it?
-I can have this?
-Yeah.
-You wanna lug it uptown, it's yours.
-Oh, I'll lug.
It's just that it's a very sensitive issue for me.
And well it should be.
I think if you spent any time with me at all you'd see I'm very sensitive to these matters as well.
You wouldn't be hungry by any chance, would you?
I could go for a bite.
Do you like Chinese food?
I went to a Szechwan restaurant in this neighborhood.
I don't remember the address.
Excuse me, you must know where the Chinese restaurant is.
Why must I know?
Because I'm Chinese?
You think I know where all the Chinese restaurants are?
Oh, ask honorable Chinaman for location of restaurant.
I thought because you're the mailman you would know the neighborhood.
Oh, hello, American Joe, which way to hamburgerlhot-dog stand?
-I didn't know-- -You know what, it's late.
-I should probably just go home.
-I had no idea-- Hey, Jerry, look what I got.
He-- -Looks pretty good.
-Yeah, did a good job.
-I don't think they'll be able to tell.
-You know, I don't get it.
I'm not allowed to ask a Chinese person where a Chinese restaurant is?
I mean, aren't we all getting a little too sensitive?
Somebody asks me which way is Israel, I don't fly off the handle.
-Anyway, what's the status with?
-Well, she kind of calmed down.
I'm gonna see her tonight.
-Oh, great.
-Yeah.
But I'm a little uncomfortable.
-I'm afraid to make another mistake.
-Come on.
Hello, hello.
-Hey, you're home.
-Hello, Georgie.
-The house looks very nice.
-Yeah, huh?
-Where's the mail?
-Hello, Jerry.
-Hello.
-So how was the trip?
Oh, your father.
Is there anything wrong with getting a receipt at a tollbooth?
I'm going upstairs.
This stack should be bigger.
Where's the TV Guide?
-What TV Guide?
-I'm missing TV Guide.
Volume 41 , number 31 .
Elaine took it to read on the subway.
-Elaine took it?
-I didn't know she took it.
Well, it's two weeks old.
How could you let her take the TV Guide?
!
He collects them.
You collect TV Guide?
The nerve of that woman.
Walking into my house, stealing my collectibles.
Oh, my God!
This was in our bed.
What is this?
A prophylactic rubber?
What is this doing on my bed?
I don't know.
I'll see you later.
You were having sex on our bed?
Yes.
Who told you you could have sex in our bed?
-Well, my bed is too small.
-Your bed is too small?
I'm gone two weeks, and you turn our house into Bourbon Street?
Where am I going to sleep?
-What are you talking about?
-I can't sleep in there.
-Of course you can.
-I can't.
I can't!
That's it.
You're grounded.
You can't ground me.
I'm a grown man.
You wanna live here you respect the rules of our house.
You're grounded!
So where are we gonna go eat?
I thought we'd eat at the Gentle Harvest.
I love that place, but it's usually so crowded.
-Can we get a table?
-Oh, don't worry.
I made reser-- -You made what?
-I.
I arranged for the appropriate accommodations.
And then Knick tickets.
Floor seats.
-How did you get these?
-Got them on the street from a scal-- From who?
One of those guys.
-What guys?
-You know, the guys that they sell the tickets to the sold-out events.
Wait a second.
You've got the Mark McEwen TV Guide.
-That's Al Roker.
-They're both chubby weathermen.
I get Dom DeLuise and Paul Prudhomme mixed up too.
-Could I have this?
-Sure, take it.
Thanks.
So Winona had the TV Guide.
Told you I'd make it up to you.
-Mr. Costanza was pretty mad, huh?
-Yeah.
You almost ruined his life's work.
-He collects these?
-Yeah.
All right, well, I will personally go out to Queens and deliver his Al Roker TV Guide to him.
What did you do with the one you took?
I don't know.
-Oh, hey.
-Hi.
Yeah.
Elaine, what did--?
What did he say, huh?
-What did who say?
-Your boss.
Didn't you tell him about the coffee-table book?
-Yeah, you didn't tell him, did you?
-Kramer, it is such a dumb idea.
-I'd be totally embarrassed-- -Wait a minute-- -I would be embarrassed to bring it up.
-I thought it was a pretty good idea.
It's about coffee tables, it's on a coffee table.
Yeah, right.
And on the cover is a built-in coaster.
-All right, I'm gonna go.
-Where are you going?
I'm gonna go to the cigar stores.
I'm gonna see if I can sell that Indian.
-My Indian?
-I think it's worth something.
It's kitschy.
How do you just walk into a house and take a TV Guide?
How does she expect you to watch TV?
Am I just supposed to turn it on and wander aimlessly around the dial?
Hello.
Is Elaine home?
Elaine Benes?
Oh, she's my son's friend.
And she's not welcome in this house.
Because I made her this very special gift, okay?
It's a bouquet of paper from her TV Guide.
That's my TV Guide, ripped to shreds!
-She gave that to you?
-Hey is that The Twilight Zone you're watching?
-Yeah.
-Oh, this is a good one.
Next stop, Queensborough Plaza.
Gyro.
I like your place.
It's very unassuming.
Well, why would I assume?
I never assume.
It leads to assumptions.
Oh, by the way, that TV Guide I gave you, I need it back.
-Why?
-I'm doing a report on minorities in the media, and I wanted to use the Al Roker interview.
It's too late.
I gave it to Elaine to give to George's father.
Jerry, I really need it back.
It is mine.
You can't give something and then take it back.
I mean, what are you, a--?
What?
-A person that.
-A person that what?
Well, a person that gives something and then they're dissatisfied and they wish they had never given it to the person -that they originally gave it to.
-You mean, like an Indian giver?
I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with that term.
I like the special fall preview issues the best.
Those.
I've been saving those from the beginning.
These are worth, like, a lot of money.
-Oh, hello, Elaine.
-Hello.
Elaine.
Hello.
You look scrumptious.
Why'd you take my TV Guide?
I'm so sorry about that, Mr. Costanza.
But look, look.
-I brought you another one.
-I made this for you.
Thank you.
What is this?
You got stains all over it.
What the hell did you do?
-Hey, you can't talk to her like that.
-I'll talk to her any way I want.
Come on, Elaine.
Let's go.
My coffee table!
I don't understand.
How can you have a cigar store without an Indian?
It's unseemly.
-I'll give you a box of coronas for it.
-Forget it.
Excuse me, are you selling this Indian?
-Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
-I'm just redecorating my office in a southwestern motif, and this would be perfect.
-Give you $500 for it?
-Giddyup.
Yeah?
Could you help me bring it up to my office?
I'm right next door.
Pendant Publishing.
Pendant Publishing.
Giddyup again.
Mr. Lippman, I'm sorry.
I was in Queens-- -Kramer.
-Yeah.
Hi, Elaine.
What are you doing in here with that?
Well, it's a business transaction.
Listen, petty cash just had 1 0s and 20s.
-Go ahead.
Count it.
-Yeah.
I'm sure it's all here.
I was just admiring your coffee table out in the hall.
You like that, huh?
I had that custom-made for me in Santa Fe.
-You mind if I use it in my book?
-What book?
Well, I'm doing a coffee-table book on coffee tables.
About coffee tables?
That's fantastic.
-Who's your publisher?
-I'm still shopping it around.
Yeah?
You see?
This is the kind of idea you should be coming in with.
What the hell do you do around here all day anyway?
-Well, I read manuscripts-- -The Indian really completes the room.
Don't you think?
I know this coffee table.
It's George Costanza's.
It's mine.
I'm his mother.
Oh, I haven't seen George for a while.
He must be working very hard.
George doesn't work.
He's a bum.
That's why he lives at home with us.
He does?
I don't know why we think of this.
We just could call TV Guide.
I don't know.
Well, it's going to make Mr. Costanza very happy.
I guess.
-What's the matter?
-What do you think is the matter?
I've been assigned to work on Kramer's coffee-table book.
It is a good idea, Elaine.
Next stop, Queensborough Plaza.
-Do you want a gyro?
-I don't think so.
Elaine!
Well, I guess your boyfriend's gonna have to catch the next train.
-He's not my boyfriend.
-He's not?
Interesting.
I was always excited as a kid when that new TV Guide would come.
When that front cover is nice and flat it seems like there's good, fresh TV shows.
Then as the week goes by, you start to hate the TV.
All the shows stink.
Everything's getting all crumpled and ripped from being sat on, thrown across the room.
TV Guide's always thrown, never handed to another person.
It's the world's most thrown reading material.
"Where's the TV Guide?
" "There it is".
In the back of the TV Guide, they have a phone number.
Ninety-five cents a minute, they'll give you the answers to the TV Guide crossword puzzle.
My question is if you can't do the TV Guide crossword puzzle where are you coming across 95 cents?
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Doctor is a prestigious occupation but it's one of the only jobs where you have to have your diploma right up there on the wall.
It makes them seem so insecure, doesn't it?
"I really am a doctor, you know.
If you think I'm not, just check it out".
I don't know why they need these little bits of psychological leverage over us.
"Go in that room, take your pants off, wait 1 5 minutes then I'll give you my opinion".
After that, anybody with pants on seems like they know what they're talking about.
In any difference of opinion, pants always beats no pants.
Can I say one word to you?
Lobster.
The lobster here is unbelievable.
A little expensive.
-Twenty-five dollars.
-Yes, well, you know I'm not thinking about the price.
You know, you're the only woman I've never thought about the price.
Get the lobster.
I beg you to get it.
-Go for it.
Go for the lobster.
-George.
George I think we have to talk.
I think we have a problem.
We do?
We can't keep seeing each other.
Why?
Because it's over.
It's my parents, George.
The differences in our religion.
George can you ever forgive me?
Have you decided yet?
Yes.
I'll have the lobster.
You know, I'm starting to think that maybe lobster isn't the way to go.
-What?
He asked you out?
-We started to talk, I told him I jog -and he put his hand on my heart.
-On your heart?
-Jerry, the man is a doctor.
-Doctor.
He's a podiatrist.
So?
Same thing.
Anyone can get into podiatry school.
George got into podiatry school.
-Really?
-Sure.
-Hello.
-Oh, hi.
-Are you gonna be stopping by later?
-Yes, I'll be stopping.
-Okay.
I'll see you later.
-See you later.
Well, we can't all be dating podiatrists.
-It's over.
-What?
-How'd you get in?
-Kramer.
-What's that?
-Lobster.
Looks like a swan.
-She says we can't go out anymore.
-Why?
Because I'm not Latvian Orthodox.
Her parents won't let her date anyone who isn't Latvian Orthodox!
Latvian Orthodox?
It is lobster.
She's limiting herself to Latvian Orthodox?
-That's too bad.
-I know.
This was the only woman I never lied to.
Well, that's not entirely true.
Oh, whatever.
-This is delicious.
-Succulent.
She knew I didn't have a job.
She knew I lived at home.
Didn't seem to bother her.
I think I could have married this woman.
Why don't you just ask her parents?
I can't.
I met them.
They're devout.
You know, in the cab on the way over here, I. I actually thought about converting.
-To Latvian Orthodox?
-Why not?
What do I care?
You know, it's not like changing toothpaste.
I think it would be romantic.
-Really?
-Yeah.
It's like Edward VIII abdicating the throne to marry Mrs. Simpson.
Like King Edward.
-Like King Edward, Jerry.
-Yeah, well King Edward didn't live in Queens with Frank and Estelle Costanza.
You know what?
I could probably do this.
-What's the difference?
-George, I was just kidding around.
I wouldn't even tell her.
I could surprise her.
-George, I wasn't serious.
-How hard could it be?
You make a little contribution, you have a ceremony.
I am gonna think about this.
I am really gonna think about this.
-I guess this one is my fault.
-Oh, yeah.
That was nice.
Have you always been such a good kisser?
I don't know.
Not always.
No?
No, I. I had to work at it.
As a kid, while kids were out playing, I'd be in my room practicing kissing.
It was worth it.
I'll be right back.
-Where are you going?
-To wash my hands.
-They're sticky from the orange.
-Meet you back here?
-Right there.
-Okay.
Fungicide?
Fungus?
Fungicide.
-I mean, what could she have?
-I don't know.
-Fungus.
-Exactly.
-So, what'd you say?
-I said I was coming down with the flu and I had to go home.
What were you doing opening her medicine cabinet?
I didn't open it.
It was open.
I just nudged it a little.
-You were snooping.
-I was not snooping.
I did not break the seal.
There was no breaking and entering.
-I wouldn't do that.
-I would.
I always open medicine cabinets.
Well, I trust people not to do that.
Big mistake.
Why don't you ask that doctor what it is.
Now he's a doctor?
Before he was a podiatrist.
But that's what podiatrists do.
They deal in fungus.
They're knee-deep in fungus.
This guy knows fungus.
I am not going to ask him about funguses.
Fungi.
-What?
-Fungi.
Why do you want to accept the Latvian Orthodox faith?
In this age of uncertainty and confusion a man begins to ask himself certain questions.
How can one even begin to put into words something so.
Enigmatic?
-Vast?
-No, not vast.
Well, whatever it is, basically you like the religion.
-Yes.
-Is there one aspect of the faith you find particularly attractive?
I think the hats.
The hat conveys that solemn religious look you want in a faith.
Very pious.
Are you familiar with Orthodox theology?
Well, perhaps not to the extent that you are, but.
But I know the basic plot, yeah.
-Plot?
-Yes, you know, the flood and the lepers and the commandments and all that.
Well, it's obvious you are sincere in your desire.
Oh, yes, I am, Father.
Incredibly sincere.
So am I in?
The first step would be to familiarize yourself with these texts.
You see, Father, I'm incredibly anxious to become a member.
Don't you offer any kind of an express conversion?
A quick change?
Yes?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Father, there's a man waiting in the chapel.
Well, you may attend to it, Sister.
This is George Costanza.
He is interested in joining the Church.
Are you?
Well, that's wonderful.
-Well, good luck to you.
-Thank you.
Nice nun.
No, no.
Sister Roberta is not a nun.
She is what we call a novice.
She won't be taking her final vows until next Thursday.
May I help you?
Yeah.
I'm here to pick up my friend, George Costanza.
-Well, he's in with the Father.
-Oh, yeah.
-I'm Sister Roberta.
-Oh, Kramer, yeah.
It's a pleasure.
Mine.
I can't believe how easy it is.
I'm virtually Orthodox.
All I have to do is read a few books, memorize a few prayers and I'm in the club.
-That's all there is to it?
-That's all there is to it.
By Christmas Day, I will be Brother Costanza.
And what is Brother Costanza planning on telling Mother Costanza?
Brother Costanza will be taking the vow of silence.
-Hey.
-Hey.
Oh, a Slinky.
-Sister Roberta gave it to me.
-Why'd she give you that?
Well, I think she liked me.
-What do you mean, she liked you?
-Liked me.
Kramer, they like everybody.
They're friendly people.
I think I picked up on a vibe.
-You picked up on a vibe from a nun.
-Yeah.
Jerry, I'm telling you, I have this power and I have no control over it.
Yeah.
All right.
That's my phone.
-Oh, hi.
-Hi.
Just wanted to stop by and see how you were feeling.
A little better.
Okay.
If you need anything, let me know.
-Okay.
All right.
-Okay.
-Bye.
-Bye.
Story.
She's subletting Carol's place for a month.
-Yeah.
She likes you.
-Yeah.
But there's a problem.
I found a tube of a fungicide in her medicine cabinet.
-So?
-So I don't know why she's using it.
How do you even know it's hers?
Maybe it belonged to Carol.
-Did you see a name on the tube?
-I didn't look.
Well, take a look.
It might not even belong to her.
People always leave things in medicine cabinets.
I got this old bottle of cough medicine.
I still have Brylcreem.
-Hi.
-Hi.
-Could I use your bathroom?
-My bathroom?
-You sure you don't mind?
-Oh, of course not.
People ask me medical questions all the time.
Well, I mean, the question isn't even for me, actually.
-It's for a friend.
-Elaine, I'm used to it.
-I'm a doctor.
-Well podiatrist.
No, no.
I'm just saying, you didn't really go to medical school.
You went to podiatry school which I'm sure is very grueling in its own way.
I went to podiatry school because I like feet.
I chose to work with feet.
-I like feet too.
I'm just saying-- -Saying what?
-How you doing in there?
-Fine.
All done.
-Just looking for the soap.
-No soap?
No, I don't see it.
Here you go.
George?
What are you doing in there?
What?
Nothing.
-You've been in there an hour.
-You don't feel well?
-I'm fine.
-I want to know -what you're doing in there.
-Nothing.
-George, open the door.
-No.
-Georgie.
-No!
-Hey.
-Good evening.
I hope I'm not disturbing you but I found another toy I thought you might like.
Okay.
Latvius was the son of which apostle?
And I'll need that in the form of a question.
I don't know.
I can't believe they're making me take this test.
-Hey, did you talk to the doctor?
-No.
All right, the next time you see him, show him this.
-You took her medicine.
-Well, not on purpose.
I was-- I was hoping there'd be a name on the tube.
-When are you seeing him again?
-I don't know.
We got into this thing about how podiatrists aren't real doctors.
How could you say that?
That's your fault.
You just got me thinking.
I was merely speaking extemporaneously.
I've got nothing against the foot.
I'm pro-foot.
Me too.
-Do you think I should apologize?
-Yes.
He's a doctor.
Wait a second.
-What are you doing?
-What does it look like I'm doing?
"Matthew.
Luke.
Paul".
What, you're cheating on your conversion test?
-I told you.
-What?
-I told you she liked me.
-Who?
-Sister Roberta.
-How do you know?
She told me.
She said she's never had a man stir up all these feelings inside of her.
She's questioning her faith.
She's thinking of leaving the Church.
All this power!
Look what I'm doing.
I'm dangerous, Jerry.
I'm very, very dangerous!
I must say, George, I was somewhat surprised at the results of your conversion test.
I don't recall having seen such an impressive performance.
You truly must be filled with the spirit of the Lord.
Oh, I'm full of it, Father.
Yes?
Yes?
Yes, yes, I see.
I'm sorry.
Something has come up.
Oh, sure.
I understand.
-Hey.
-Yeah.
-You wanted to see me, Father?
-Yes.
Please sit down.
Sister Roberta came to see me yesterday-- I know what this is about, Father.
I didn't do anything.
I just spoke to her innocently for just a few minutes.
It's just that I. I have this power.
Yes.
It is a Latvian word which means "the lure of the animal".
I don't understand.
Women are drawn to you.
They would give anything to be possessed by you.
Help me, Father.
Help me!
Yes, yes.
I will help you.
Now, listen very carefully.
I want you to buy three quarts of vinegar 6 ounces.
What is that stench?
I got it.
-Hey.
-Hey, what the hell is going on?
-It stinks.
What are you doing?
-I've got the kavorca.
-The kavorca?
What is that?
-The lure of the animal.
-I'm dangerous.
-What is this thing around your neck?
The priests, they're helping me.
I just bathed in vinegar.
You know, you're funkifying the whole building.
Keep away, Jerry.
Just keep away.
Kramer!
Kramer!
George Costanza?
Estelle's son?
Latvian Orthodox?
-Why are you doing this?
-For a woman.
A woman?
What, are you out of your mind?
Why can't you do anything like a normal person?
Wait.
Is this the group that goes around mutilating squirrels?
No, it's a regular religion.
I'm calling my lawyer.
It might not be too late to get out of this.
-I don't want to get out of it!
-But, George you don't know what you're saying.
You're under their control.
-What, they brainwashed you?
-No.
No.
You're not performing any rituals in this house!
Go back to the psychiatrist.
I beg you.
And stay away from those squirrels.
-Oh, hi.
-How you doing, Jerry?
-Good.
What's the matter?
-I'm tired.
I hardly slept last night with all the scratching.
Bonkers was going crazy.
-Bonkers?
-My cat.
He's got this weird sort of skin condition.
It's some type of fungus.
I couldn't find his medicine.
-Oh, it's your cat!
-What?
Nothing.
-Are you ready, my son?
-Yes, "faddah".
-What did you say?
-What?
I thought you said "faddah".
I said "faddah".
I. I meant "Father".
Just a little bit nervous.
Of course.
How you doing?
Get away from me, you creep.
Yes.
Yes, it worked!
Sister Roberta.
I still got time to catch her.
I gotta get there.
Congratulations, George.
Welcome to the faith.
Sister Roberta, would you please offer the final benediction?
I can't.
I'm sorry.
It's a beautiful religion but I am not worthy of it.
I've found something else.
Him.
You know, because I love the foot.
I'm a big fan of the foot.
Well, it's my fault.
I got a little defensive.
And that pinkie toe.
Come on!
How adorable is the pinkie toe?
It's my favorite toe.
Let's face it.
You get a bunion, where you going?
-You're not going to the ear guy.
-No, you're not.
Would you excuse me?
I'll be right back.
-Where's the bathroom?
-It's right down here to the left.
I will meet you right back here?
Elaine, it's her cat.
Her cat has the fungus.
So I need the tube back.
Fungicide?
Fungus?
Something's wrong.
I don't feel the same lure.
You don't?
What have l--?
I must return to the Church.
By the way, you really need to take a bath.
You stink.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
Once you put medicine in your cabinet you're never using it again.
Medicine you use is on the sink.
It's not really a medicine cabinet.
It's really like an ointment museum.
It's like, "Here's a salve from 1 983 some cream from the '70s".
But you want to keep it private.
A medicine cabinet is a place that reveals our weaknesses and can throw off the balance between people that are going out.
Somebody peeks in there, "Oh, I see Mr. Perfect needs tough actin' Tinactin.
Well, I guess I'll be calling the shots in this relationship from now on".
-You did that for me?
-Well, I didn't do it for my mother.
-I'm really flattered.
-Yeah.
But I just don't feel ready to make a commitment yet.
Maybe when I get back from Latvia.
Latvia?
Yes.
I'm going to stay with some relatives there for a year.
Isn't it great?
Enjoy.
Enjoy.
Oh, George.
You are so sweet.
Don't ever change.
I'd like a doggy bag for this, please.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
The whale's supposed to be an intelligent animal.
You hear about how they communicate by song from miles away how extensive their vocabulary is.
From the rate we're pushing the whales off the beach back into the ocean, the words "shore" and "close" do not appear to be in their vocabulary.
I'd say to them, "Concentrate less on the singing a little more on the approaching Cuervo beach volleyball tournament if you want to maintain that brainy-mammal image".
I can't believe this.
What a dope!
Excuse me.
I'm sorry.
This is.
This is kind of embarrassing but there's no toilet paper over here.
Are you talking to me?
Yeah.
I just forgot to check, so if you could spare some.
No, I'm sorry.
-What?
-No, I'm sorry.
I can't spare it.
-You can't spare it?
-No.
There's not enough to spare.
Well, I don't need much.
Just three squares will do it.
I'm sorry, I don't have three squares.
Now, if you don't mind.
Three squares?
You can't spare three squares?
No, I don't have a square to spare.
I can't spare a square!
Well, is it two-ply?
Because if it's two-ply, I'll take one ply.
One ply.
One puny little ply.
I'll take one measly ply!
Look, I don't have a square and I don't have a ply!
No, no, don't go!
I beg you!
I love this artificial flavoring.
I like it better than butter.
I think it's more consistent.
You would not believe what just happened to me in the bathroom.
-Hey.
-Hey.
-Hey, where's my popcorn, babe?
-What?
My popcorn.
You were supposed to get me popcorn.
Did you forget about me, babe?
You would not believe what just happened to me in the bathroom.
I mean, a person needs a certain amount of toilet paper to be covered.
I simply could not spare it.
This woman just didn't get it.
She kept harassing me.
Three squares!
That's all I was asking for.
Three squares!
She wouldn't stop.
"Help me!
Help me"!
She was insane.
I was begging her.
"Please, please"!
She was insane.
Who does she think she is?
How dare she?
Do you want me to get the manager?
Too bad they don't have old ladies walking around with flashlights.
-Flush her out.
-I don't even know what she looks like.
I wonder where Elaine is sitting.
I really wanted you to meet her.
She's supposed to be here with her new boyfriend.
I wonder where Jerry's sitting.
He's supposed to be here with his new girlfriend.
-I'm dying to see what she looks like.
-Hey.
You think if I jumped off that balcony, I'd get hurt?
-Hey.
Hey, guy.
-Hey.
Can I use your phone in your bedroom?
What's the matter with yours?
My batteries are dead.
It's not one of those 9 76 calls, is it?
Come on.
Let me use it.
Five minutes.
I'll pay you back.
Why do you do that?
I am never going to the movies again.
Where were you last night?
I looked for you.
I looked for you too.
I was over on the side.
Oh, with pretty boy Tony.
-Yeah, right.
Okay.
-"Hey.
Hey".
Tony.
-"Hey".
-That's nice.
Listen to this.
I am in the bathroom, right, before the movie starts and I'm in the stall, and there's no toilet paper.
No what?
Toilet paper.
So I ask this woman in the stall next to me for some and she refuses!
Well, maybe she couldn't spare it.
-A square?
-Well, you know sometimes a square is everything.
-A ply?
-Elaine, you cannot judge a person in a situation like that.
It's like asking for someone's canteen in the desert.
-It's battle conditions.
-Yeah, well I just hope I run into her again, okay?
Because I will never forget that flinty voice.
It is tattooed in my brain.
If I hear it, watch out.
So listen, what happened with Jane last night?
Jane, she.
She.
The four of us are going out Saturday.
That should be fun.
Yeah, that should be real fun.
-It's getting late.
Can I call Tony?
-Yeah.
Then we'll get a cab and we'll do it in the back seat.
How's that, Andre?
-Andre?
-What about the driver?
-We'd get in an accident.
-So what?
Well, that wouldn't be very good.
Hey, Andre, get the hell off the phone!
-What is going on?
Who is Andre?
-Kramer's Andre.
He's fooling around with these 9 76 numbers.
Hey, I told you, I don't want you doing that on my phone!
Jerry, I'm telling you, this phone-sex thing is hilarious.
Like this Erica woman.
Here, look.
You gotta call her.
What a voice she uses.
You know, it's weird, because that voice sounded familiar to me.
-You hungry?
Wanna--?
Monk's?
-No.
I gotta go downtown.
-You're giving me a lift home, right?
-Yeah.
So listen, what happened last night with Jane?
Oh, nothing.
She just choked on a Jujube.
You know, I hate to tell you this, but it is time to defrost your freezer.
I know.
I just can't bring myself to do it.
Meanwhile that freezer keeps getting smaller and smaller.
Don't wanna keep Tony waiting.
-Hey, you got a problem with Tony?
-Hunky Tony.
"Hey".
Okay.
Jerry, I would be going out with him no matter what he looked like.
-Of course you would.
-Oh, yeah.
Like you're one to talk.
-Elaine -What?
it's different for a man.
We're expected to be superficial.
-I'm not being superficial.
-Elaine, he's a male bimbo.
He's a "mimbo".
He's not a mimbo.
He is an exciting, charismatic man who just happens to have a perfect face.
And that's why you're going out with him.
No, it is not.
You know, I think George has a non-sexual crush on him.
I think he does too.
I mean, every time I see him, it's Tony this, Tony that.
George is like a schoolgirl around him.
So I said: "Hey, dude you better step off".
-Step off?
-Yeah.
You said, "Step off"?
God, that is too much!
Hey, hey, Tony I just had this brainstorm for us.
-Can you guess what it is?
-No.
Bowling.
What do you say?
Bowling, huh?
Bowling's insane!
Bowling is crazy time!
Bowling?
I don't think so, George.
You get no rush from bowling.
Rush?
You want a rush?
Drop a ball on your toe, my friend!
Talk about a rush, you'll be throbbing!
-You'll see visions!
-No, no, no.
I'm thinking rock climbing.
All right!
Rock climbing!
Just the two of us?
All right.
All right.
Hey, I'll make some sandwiches.
What do you like?
Tuna, peanut butter?
-Whatever.
-All right.
I gotta buy some bread.
You know, I am definitely down for some rock climbing.
Yeah, me too.
I am down.
I am totally down.
Mark me down.
Cool.
So, what do you say we climb a rock mañana?
Mañana.
Mañana might be a problem.
I'm supposed to have a boil lanced mañana and I think they charge me if I cancel with only one mañana's notice.
-Hey, Kramer!
-Hey, Tony.
-Hey!
-Hey, Georgie.
Kramer, my man, what are you doing mañana?
Mañana I'm doing nada.
What do you say you scale some rock with me and George?
Tony, that's gonna be too many sandwiches.
Come on, Kramer.
What do you say?
Kramer, it's pretty dangerous up there.
-No, I'm down.
-Yes!
-Yeah!
I'll see you.
-All right, buddy.
Take it easy, Kramer.
You down, George?
What's wrong?
-Oh, no, I am down.
-Yeah!
Rock climbing?
Where do you come off going rock climbing?
Rock climbing?
You need a boost to climb into your bed.
All right.
All right.
What is it with you and Tony?
What, you're his sidekick now?
Yeah.
That's right.
I like it.
He's such a cool guy.
"A cool guy"?
What, are you in eighth grade?
He's the first cool guy I've ever been friends with in my life.
It's a different world when you're with a cool guy.
He's not afraid of anybody.
You should hear the way he talks to waitresses.
He gets free pie!
-Hey.
-Hey.
-Nice move today.
-What?
Horning in on my rock-climbing trip!
It's just supposed to be me and Tony.
-He asked me.
-You put him on the spot.
You know, I think that you're in love with him.
What?
-That's ridiculous!
-No, no.
I don't think so.
You love him.
You better be careful on those rocks tomorrow, buddy.
And you're not getting any sandwiches either!
-You're making sandwiches?
-Hello?
I don't know if there's gonna be places to eat up there.
-Who?
-Elaine, does Tony like peanut butter?
Hates it.
Good thing I asked.
Who is it?
-Well, she says Jane.
-Yeah, so?
Well, that voice, it's very familiar.
Throaty, almost flinty.
-Did you say "flinty"?
-Yeah.
Yeah.
Flinty.
Hello!
Hello!
Hey, George, you hear that echo?
Oh, God, please get off me!
I don't want to die up here!
Please!
Please, please stop moving.
That's all I ask of you.
-Kramer!
Kramer!
-Let go!
Hey!
George, let go of my leg!
Grab the rock!
-Grab the rock!
-What rock?
The rock in front of you!
Come on, grab it!
You've gotta relax.
Try to yodel.
Yodel.
-That's it.
That's it.
-George!
Kramer!
-Yeah?
-Take the rope thread it through the carabiner and knot it.
Then I'll climb up to where you are.
-All right.
George, you got it?
-Yeah.
-You got it, George?
-Yeah.
All right, take it.
Hey, George, you got anything to eat, dude?
Yeah, I. I got some sandwiches.
I got tuna and salmon salad, Tony because I know you don't like peanut butter.
What?
Do some-- I've got oil all over me.
Can I have your napkin?
-What?
-Your napkin.
I'm dripping.
-Well, where's your napkin?
-I used it up.
Well, I need mine.
Oh, God, look at the time.
I gotta get to work.
You know, I'd like to hear about this job of yours.
I told you already, it's very boring.
You know, I think I had a little too much garlic.
-Can I have a piece of your gum?
-You're fine.
-Oh, how's this thing work?
-Just press it.
-It's Elaine.
-Oh, come on up.
-Who is it?
-It's Elaine.
-Is she coming up?
-Yeah.
Your breath is a little garlicky.
You better take some gum.
-Okay.
-Here, have a couple pieces.
It's weak.
Weak gum.
Yeah.
-Have some more.
For the road.
-Isn't that too much?
Trust me.
Believe me.
-It's good.
Yes.
-Smells?
Yeah.
Stinks.
Terrible.
-Hi, Elaine.
-Hi.
How are you?
This is Jane.
Elaine.
-Hi.
-Hi.
Nice to meet you finally.
It is so nice to meet you.
I look forward to Saturday night.
Yeah, me too.
-Okay, so I'll see you Saturday night.
-Saturday night.
What is with the gum?
It's a big problem.
She puts like four pieces in her mouth.
It's ridiculous.
I don't think we can get together Saturday.
-Because of the gum?
-Well, it's too much.
It's embarrassing.
-Why does she chew so many?
-She always has to be different.
-She's in there.
I can hear her.
-All right, who's gonna tell her?
-You tell her.
-It was your fault.
If you hadn't come, it wouldn't have happened!
I was the one who was invited, you-- -Well, look.
Look who's here.
-Hey!
-What are you doing here?
-You're alive!
Yeah.
Yeah.
-Did you have fun?
-Yeah.
-Well.
Yes.
-For a little while.
Where's Tony?
Kramer was supposed to tie a knot-- -You were supposed to tie the knot.
-What, did something happen?
Well Tony took a bit of a tumble.
His face?
Did something happened to his face?
Well, it all depends on what you mean by "happen".
-He's alive.
-Yeah.
What happened to his face?
Tell me, what happened?
Well, you see, he slipped and landed on a kind of a. -A rock.
-Yeah.
-The ambulance got there quickly.
-A big rock.
We rode with him to the hospital.
Yeah.
I sang "99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall".
Well, aside from that, how'd he like the sandwiches?
So, what did the doctor say?
They said.
-They said I'm coming along.
-Yeah.
But what else did they say?
Well, let's see.
They said: "Tony, try to keep it clean".
Right.
Yeah.
No, I mean did they get into stuff like Iong, jagged scars or gross deformities, major skin grafts, stuff like that?
I really don't remember.
I was kind of out of it the first couple of days.
I was on a lot of medication.
It was kind of like a haze.
It was pretty cool.
But, you know, in this medicated haze in this sort of woozy state do you recall the words "radical reconstructive surgery" being uttered?
I don't know.
I don't know.
-Think, Tony.
Think.
-I'm drawing a blank, babe.
Excuse me.
-Hi, Elaine.
-Yeah, this-- -This isn't a very good time, George.
-I just wanted to talk to Tony for a minute.
Step off, George.
I don't want to see you.
-Me?
Step off?
-Yeah.
Tony says you better step off, George, so.
But why?
It wasn't my fault.
l-- You asked me for a sandwich.
l-- I made such delicious sandwiches, Elaine.
Just beat it, dude!
Here, Elaine, here.
It's Superman.
Tony, please.
Next time, it'll just be the two of us.
There won't be any next time, George.
-Oh, Tony, don't.
-Okay.
Step off, George, okay?
Can you just step off?
Step off.
Step off.
Step off.
-George, wait, wait.
-Yes?
Would you throw this trash out?
Oh, I've been waiting a while for this.
It's a shame Tony got all banged up.
We're not gonna be able to get together.
-Oh, that's too bad.
What a shame.
-Yeah, it is.
It's a damn shame.
A damn shame.
-Maybe when he's feeling better.
-Yeah.
Without a doubt.
I'm down.
-Oh, hey.
How you doing?
-Hey, hey.
-Jane, this is my neighbor, Kramer.
-Oh, hey.
Hello, Kramer.
Well, hello, Jane.
Jerry's told me so much about you, I feel like I know you intimately.
I don't think so.
No, we never met.
-I never talked to you on the phone.
-Where you going?
-Uptown.
To the Y. -I'm going uptown.
Wanna split a cab?
What about the driver?
What are you talking about?
I changed my mind.
Yeah, I don't think I'm gonna go now.
All right, I'll see you later.
Nice meeting you.
See you.
-What's with you?
-That's her.
-Who?
-Erica!
She's Erica!
Oh, you think she's Erica, the phone-sex woman?
Jerry, that voice is tattooed on my brain, it's her.
-I'm telling you, it's her!
-Oh, you're crazy.
Am I?
Or am I so sane that you just blew your mind?
-It's impossible!
-Is it?
Or is it so possible that your head is spinning like a top?
-It can't be!
-Can't it?
Or is your entire world just crashing down all around you?
-All right.
That's enough.
-Yeah!
He's supposed to get the bandages off on Sunday.
-What if?
-What?
You know: You're afraid he might look like Zippy the Pinhead.
Yeah.
I mean, what is my obligation here?
You know, we were just dating.
It was probably gonna be over in a couple of weeks anyway.
I thought you didn't care about his looks.
I lied.
Are you kidding?
He's a mimbo.
I know that.
But he's my mimbo.
And even if he is a hideous freak maybe I can learn to love him.
And maybe in some final irony I'll learn what love really is.
You know, Jerry?
I'm sorry.
I didn't get most of that.
-Is that Kramer over there?
-Yeah.
Yeah.
Hey, Kramer.
-Hey.
-Hey.
-It's all set.
-What's all set?
Erica's gonna meet me here.
Now we're gonna find out the truth.
-How'd you get her to meet you here?
-We have a certain chemistry.
Oh, my God!
Hi.
I thought I'd find you here.
-Hello, Erica.
-Erica?
What are you talking about?
How could you say things like that over the phone?
What are you talking about?
Selling sexual pleasure on the phone?
I sell paper goods, you jerk.
Paper goods?
Excuse me.
Do you have a tissue?
No, I'm sorry.
I can't spare it.
There's just not enough to spare.
Where's the ladies' room?
I have to go to the bathroom too.
Oh, damn.
Something wrong?
Yeah, there's no toilet paper in here.
I usually check.
Would you mind?
I can't.
I don't have it.
I don't have a square to spare.
I can't spare a square.
Hey, wait a minute.
-I know you!
-That's right, honey.
-And I know you!
-No.
Wait!
No!
-Here.
Take it.
-Thanks.
Don't call me anymore.
You either.
Now, of course, the thing is extreme sports.
Bungee jumping.
To me, the bungee jumping is a sport, so is being a crash-test dummy.
Just leaning does not make it a sport.
It's like a Wile E. Coyote idea, isn't it?
The thing I wonder about the skydiving is why do they even bother with the helmets?
Can you almost make it?
You might as well wear a party hat.
What's the difference?
You jump out of a plane the chute doesn't open, I got news for you: The helmet is now wearing you for protection.
Later on, the helmet is talking to the other helmets: "Good thing he was there, or I would have hit the ground directly".
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
I love these nature shows.
And it's amazing how you can always relate.
You're watching the African dung beetle and going: "Boy, his life is a lot like mine".
You always root for whichever animal is the star of the show.
Like, if it's the antelope, and a lion's chasing it you go, "Run, antelope, run.
Use your speed.
Get away".
Then next week it's the lion and then you go, "Get the antelope.
Eat him.
Bite his ass!
Trap him.
Don't let him use his speed".
Well, did he bring it up in the meeting?
Elaine, see this T-shirt?
Six years, I've had this T-shirt.
It's my best one.
I call him Golden Boy.
Yeah.
I'm on the phone here.
Golden Boy's always the first shirt I wear out of the laundry.
Here.
Touch Golden Boy.
No, thanks.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'll hold.
But, see, look at the collar.
It's fraying.
Golden Boy is slowly dying.
Each wash brings him one step closer.
That's what makes it such a tragic figure.
Why don't you just let Golden Boy -soak in the sink with some Woolite.
-No.
The reason he's the iron man is because he goes out and plays every game.
Wash, spin, rinse, spin.
If you take that away from him, you break his spirit.
Yeah.
What?
He is?
Oh, that's fantastic.
I'm so excited.
Yes, I'm excited.
Okay.
Okay, I'll be in soon.
Yeah, yeah, I'm coming.
I'm coming.
Okay, bye.
-Yuri Testikov, the Russian writer.
-The guy who was in the gulag?
Yeah.
Pendant's publishing his new book and I'm gonna work on it.
Lippman and I are gonna go to the airport and pick him up in a limousine.
You wanna borrow Golden Boy?
Do you know what this means?
It's like working with Tolstoy.
I read an unbelievable thing about Tolstoy the other day.
Did you know the original title for War and Peace was War--What is it Good For?
No, I'm not kidding, Elaine.
It's true.
His mistress didn't like the title and insisted he change it to War and Peace.
-But it's a line from that song.
-That's where they got it from.
-Really?
-I'm not joking.
You can't handle the truth.
What?
I'm working on my Jack Nicholson.
You can't handle the truth.
-What is this, your mail?
-Yeah.
I grabbed it on the way out.
I don't want my mother reading it.
Your alumni magazine.
-Your mother reads your mail?
-Yeah.
-What do you mean, like postcards?
-No.
Anything.
-She doesn't open.
-She'll open.
You've caught your mother opening envelopes?
-Yes.
-What does she say?
"I was curious".
-Isn't that against the law?
-Maybe I can get her locked up.
Hey, Jerry, you're in the alumni magazine.
Listen to this: "Jerry Seinfeld has appeared on David Letterman and The Tonight Show and he did a pilot for NBC called Jerry that was not picked up".
Georgie, how come there's not anything about you in here?
He can't handle the truth.
All right, this is too much fun.
I gotta get back to work.
You all right?
Yeah.
-Sorry.
-It's okay.
Yeah.
Oh, hey, wait, wait.
Maybe you could use this.
Yeah.
It's an electronic organizer.
-What?
-Yeah.
-What--?
-Yeah, here.
Yeah.
You know for phone numbers, addresses, keep appointments, everything.
Yeah, it's got an alarm that beeps.
Oh, I can't believe this, Kramer.
I've been wanting to get one of these things.
Are you sure that--?
-Sure you can't use this thing?
-No.
I got all my appointments right up here.
-Where'd you get this?
-The bank.
I opened a new account.
Hey, did you see that whale thing on TV last night?
No.
I am such a huge whale fan.
These marine biologists showed how they communicate with the squeaks and the squeals.
-What a fish.
-It's a mammal.
Whatever.
Hey, new tape recorder?
Yeah, I got it from the bank.
-Hey.
-Hey.
Who wants to have some fun?
-I do.
-I do.
Now, are you just saying that, or do you really wanna have fun?
I really wanna have fun.
I'm just saying I wanna have some fun.
Right now, there are 600 Titleists that I got from the driving range in the trunk of my car.
Why don't we drive out to Rockaway and hit them into the ocean!
Now picture this.
We find a nice, sweet spot between the dunes we take out our drivers, we tee up, and: That ball goes sailing up into the sky holds there for a moment, and then: -You wanna get some lunch?
-Yeah.
Let me stop by the cash machine, and I'll meet you.
Yeah, I'm gonna get a paper.
-Keep your head down.
-Yeah.
Cash advance?
Yes.
No.
Balance inquiry?
No.
Receipt?
No.
Processing, processing.
I won.
Jerry?
-Yeah.
-It's Diane.
-Diane DeConn from Queens College.
-Oh, Diane.
-How are you?
-Good.
-Good.
-How long has it been?
Since college.
I've seen you on TV.
You're doing great.
-Yeah, plugging along.
-I got the alumni magazine.
What ever happened to George?
I notice I never see his name in there.
Well, he's kind of modest.
He was always such a goof-off.
I mean, did he ever get anywhere?
-Sure.
-Yeah?
What field?
Marine biology.
George is a marine biologist?
Yeah.
Pretty damn good one too.
I can't believe it.
-I would never have thought.
-Yeah.
He's specializing in whales.
He's working on lowering the cholesterol level in whales.
All that blubber.
It's quite unhealthy.
It's the largest mammal on Earth, but as George says they don't have to be.
Diane DeConn?
You saw Diane DeConn?
-Something, huh?
-How did she look?
She looked great.
She asked about you.
She asked about me?
What did she say?
"How's George"?
George?
She said George?
She remembered my name.
Diane DeConn remembered my name.
She was the "it" girl.
She asked for your number.
I think she's gonna get in touch with you.
Okay, I'm telling you right now if you're kidding, I'm not gonna be able to be your friend anymore.
I'm serious about that.
You got that?
-I got no problem with that.
-Good.
Because if this is a lie, if this is a joke if this is your idea of some cute little game, we're finished.
Expect a call.
Oh, my God, he's not kidding.
Now I should tell you that at this point she's under the impression that you're a. -A what?
-A marine biologist.
-A marine biologist?
-Yes.
Why am I a marine biologist?
I may have mentioned it.
But I'm not a marine biologist.
Yes, I know that.
So?
Why, you don't think it's a good job?
I didn't even know it was a job.
Oh, it's a fascinating field.
Well, what if she calls me?
What am I supposed to say?
Algae.
Obviously plankton.
I don't know what else I could tell you.
I just got back from a trip to the Galápagos Islands.
I was living with turtles.
We have got you in a very nice hotel.
I don't know how you like to work but I can arrange for an office if you like.
-I work in hotel.
Is better.
-In the hotel.
Away from all your little petty bickerings and interference.
You know, Tolstoy used to write in the village square.
The faces inspired him.
He did not need inspiration.
God spoke through his pen.
-That is so true.
-Yes.
Although, one wonders if War and Peace would have been as highly acclaimed, had it been published under its original title War--What is it Good For?
-What?
-Yeah.
Mr. Lippman, it was his mistress who insisted -that he call it War and Peace.
-Elaine, Elaine.
War--What is it Good For?
Absolutely nothing Say it again -Elaine.
-It's a song.
They took it from Tolstoy.
-No.
Elaine.
-War - What is it Good For?
-It's her sense of humor.
-No, it's not.
That is true.
-What is that noise?
-No, it's not.
-That noise!
What is that noise?
It's traveling up my spine, into my brain.
-It's coming from your purse.
-It must be my new organizer.
-That noise.
-Turn it off.
-Right.
I think it's this-- -I cannot stand it.
-It's the button at the top.
-Okay.
-Will you turn it off?
-Not the-- The one at the top.
Give it to me.
I did it for you.
I don't know why you had to tell her that.
You put me in a very difficult position.
Marine biologist.
I'm very uncomfortable with this whole thing.
I would think it's right up your alley.
Well, it's not up my alley.
It's one thing if I make it up, I know what I'm doing.
I know my alleys.
You got me in the Galápagos Islands living with the turtles.
I don't know where the hell I am.
You came in the other day with all that whale stuff the squeaking and the squealing.
Look, why couldn't you make me an architect?
You know I always wanted to pretend I was an architect.
Well, I'm supposed to see her tomorrow.
I'm gonna tell her what's going on.
I mean, maybe she just likes me for me.
-Hey.
-Hey.
You want these?
I don't want them.
-Why?
-I stink!
I can't play.
The ball is just sitting there, Jerry, and I can't hit it.
I only hit one really good ball that went way out there.
-Well, what happened?
-I have no concentration.
-What's wrong with your--?
-Sand.
I can't get rid of the sand.
Look at this.
Look, there's still some in here.
It won't go away.
-Look, I even got sand in the pockets.
-You're getting it all over the floor.
Hello.
Yeah.
Yes, it is.
Really?
Could you hold on a second?
Hey, listen to this.
A woman found an electronic organizer.
My name's in it.
-She wants help finding the owner.
-How'd she find it?
She's walking down the street and it hit her in the head.
So I am walking along minding my own business, when all of a sudden this thing comes flying out of nowhere and clonks me right on the head.
Yeah.
-So they took me to the hospital.
-Yeah.
Yeah.
And they put me in this thing that feels like a coffin for 45 minutes.
You ever been in one of those things?
You could go berserk in there.
-Well, you have insurance.
-I wish.
-Unbelievable.
-Yeah.
-What is with this thing?
-It never shuts up.
So anyway, you could see why I would be interested -in finding this person.
-Absolutely.
You should not have to pay for that.
Stop it.
Stop it!
Let me look at this thing.
Somebody told me they thought they saw it come out of a limousine.
Typical rich people using the world for their personal garbage can.
Boy, am I lucky your name came up.
I just pushed a button.
I want to know what my name's doing in this creep's organizer.
-Yeah.
-Who do I know who would have even been in a limousine yesterday?
-Oh, hey.
-Hey.
Great organizer you gave me.
You liked it, huh?
It wouldn't stop beeping in the car so Testikov threw it out the window.
I transferred everything in there.
I threw out my old book.
I'm lost now, Kramer.
-What?
What is it?
-The sand.
It's everywhere.
Okay, I'll see you later.
-Oh, there you are.
-There you are.
-So?
-So?
-What do you have to say for yourself?
-What do you have to say for yourself?
Why should I say anything for myself?
War--What is it Good For?
Who told you?
Yuri Testikov the Russian writer.
Hello?
You told Testikov that Tolstoy wanted to name his book War--What is it Good For?
And do you know what happened?
-Can I take a guess?
-Oh, please.
Oh, I don't know.
He threw your organizer out the window?
What?
How do you know that?
-Because I know who has it.
-How did you find it?
The woman who got hit with it found my name, called me, and we met.
-Where is it?
Give it to me.
-I don't have it.
-Why not?
-She's not returning it until she gets the money back for the hospital bill.
But I didn't do it.
Testikov did it.
He should pay for it.
How much is Testikov getting from Pendant for this book?
-One million.
-Well, that's a start.
Then, of course, with evolution the octopus lost the nostrils and took on the more familiar look that we know today.
-Really?
-Yeah.
But if you still look closely, you can see a little bump where the nose used to be.
But enough about fish.
I can discuss other things, you know.
Architecture.
-You know what room Testikov's in?
-Yeah 308.
I'm crazy for doing this.
Well, you want your organizer back, don't you?
Why are you so interested?
-You wanna take her out?
-When Superman saves someone nobody asks if he's trying to hit on her.
-Well, you're not Superman.
-Well, you're not Lois Lane.
-You got the tape recorder?
-Yeah.
You sure you wanna do this?
I gotta get Testikov on tape.
If this woman ends up in the New England Journal of Medicine, I'm not gonna pay for it.
Oh, here she comes.
-Hi.
-Hi.
Elaine, this is Corinne.
-Hello.
-Hi.
You got the organizer?
Let's go.
We'll meet you in 1 0 minutes, hopefully with the money.
Your parents must be so proud of you, George.
Oh, they're busting.
What are those people doing over there?
What?
Come in.
Come in, Miss Benes.
That is, if you can spare a minute from your busy schedule.
Now do you bring guest for my entertainment?
Yeah, this is my friend Jerry.
He accompanied me.
Single women in a big city can be dangerous, so.
That's why I wear these sneakers.
In case of any trouble, zip, I'm gone.
Yeah, yeah.
The sneakers.
All the Americans with the sneakers.
You're always running from something.
Yeah, yeah.
Well, sit.
Stop running.
Two minutes, I give you latest manuscript.
Oh, Rimsky.
Great, great book, if I may say so, sir.
I almost read the whole thing.
-What?
-lf you can't turn that thing off I'll have to ask you to leave.
-I'm waiting for two people.
-Well, you can wait for them outside.
Yeah, I guess I'd better.
I wouldn't wanna take any attention away from the hookers.
All right.
All right.
Out.
Out.
Whatever you say, Crowell.
What's going on over here?
There's a beached whale.
She's dying.
Is anyone here a marine biologist?
Here is latest draft.
I see you next week, same time, same day.
-On time, please.
-Okay.
It was nice meeting you.
You're a real pleasure.
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, by the way, Mr. Testikov do you remember the other day when we were in the limo and my organizer started making noise, and you threw it out the window?
Yes.
How can I forget?
Well, would you believe that it actually hit somebody in the head?
Right in the head.
What is that noise?
That's nothing.
-And anyway-- -What's going on?
-That noise.
-No, no.
That's my purse.
-That noise.
-No.
Get off my purse.
-It's a recorder!
-No, that's-- Radio.
You are spying on me.
-Save the whale.
-You've got to do it.
Save the whale, George.
For me.
So I started to walk into the water.
I won't lie to you, boys.
I was terrified.
But I pressed on.
And as I made my way past the breakers a strange calm came over me.
I don't know if it was divine intervention but I tell you, Jerry, at that moment I was a marine biologist.
George, I've just been reading this thing in the paper.
-It's unbelievable.
-I know.
I was just telling the story.
Well, come on, George.
Finish the story.
The sea was angry that day, my friends.
Like an old man trying to send back soup in a deli.
I got about 50 feet out, when suddenly the great beast appeared before me.
I tell you, he was 1 0 stories high if he was a foot.
As if sensing my presence, he let out a great bellow.
I said, "Easy, big fella".
And then, as I watched him struggling, I realized that something was obstructing its breathing.
From where I was standing, I could see into the eye of the great fish.
-Mammal.
-Whatever.
-What did you do next?
-Well, then from out of nowhere, a huge tidal wave lifted me tossed me like a cork, and I found myself on top of him face to face with the blowhole.
I could barely see from the waves crashing down upon me but I knew something was there.
So I reached my hand in felt around, and pulled out the obstruction.
What is that, a Titleist?
A hole in one, huh?
-The crowd must have gone wild.
-Oh, yes, yes.
Yes, Jerry.
They were all over me.
It was like Rocky I. Diane came up to me threw her arms around me kissed me.
We both had tears streaming down our faces.
I never saw anyone so beautiful.
It was at that moment that I decided to tell her that I was not a marine biologist.
What did she say?
Told me to go to hell and I took the bus home.
All right.
Let's go.
-What, are you in a bad mood?
-No.
Got my laundry back.
-Golden Boy?
-He didn't make it.
-I'm sorry.
-Yeah.
This is Golden Boy's son Baby Blue.
-What's with you?
-This sand.
-It's everywhere.
-Yep.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
We never should have landed a man on the moon.
It's a mistake.
Now everything is compared to that one accomplishment.
Everybody goes, "I can't believe they can land a man on the moon and taste my coffee".
We would've been happier if we hadn't landed a man on the moon.
We'd go, "They can't make a prescription bottle that'll open easily?
I'm not surprised they couldn't land on the moon.
Things make perfect sense".
Neil Armstrong should've said, "That's one small step for man one giant leap for every whining, complaining SOB on the Earth".
Hey, do you believe I got "Happy New Year'd" today?
It's February.
I once got "Happy New Year'd" in March.
-It's disgusting.
-It's pathetic.
-Hey, is it cold out?
-Really cold.
-Scary cold?
-What's your definition of scary cold?
Hi.
That.
What is that?
-What?
-When did you get that?
This week.
My father got a deal from a friend of his.
It's Gore-Tex.
You know about Gore-Tex?
You like saying Gore-Tex, don't you?
Look at you.
You can't even turn around in that thing.
Look at this.
Hey, George, can you feel this?
Can you--?
All right, all right!
Knock it off.
Come on, let's go.
We should stop off on the way and get a bottle of wine or something.
What for?
These people invited us for dinner.
We have to bring something.
Why?
Because it's rude otherwise.
You mean just going there because I'm invited -that's rude?
-Yes.
You're telling me, instead of them being happy to see me they'll be upset because I didn't bring anything.
You see what I'm saying?
The fabric of society is very complex, George.
I don't even drink wine.
I drink Pepsi.
You can't bring Pepsi.
Why not?
Because we're adults.
What, you're telling me that wine is better than Pepsi?
No way wine is better than Pepsi.
George, I don't think we wanna walk in there and put a big plastic jug of Pepsi in the middle of the table.
I don't like the idea that any time there's a dinner invitation there's this annoying little chore.
You're getting to be an annoying little chore yourself.
All right, let's go.
Who's driving?
You are.
I can't get that thing in my car.
Where's the heat in this car?
Come on.
Warm me up.
-It's cold.
Give us a little squeeze.
-Get off of me.
Get off of-- Get off of me.
You're comfortable up there, bubble boy.
Oh, yeah.
You wish you had this coat.
I was just thinking, the four of us can't show up -with just one bottle of wine.
-Oh, here we go.
-What?
-Why don't we get them a couch.
We'll rent a U-Haul.
We'll bring them a nice sectional.
We should bring some cake.
Will you stop off at the bakery?
Why don't you just get some Ring Dings from the liquor store.
Ring Dings?
Ring Dings are better than anything at a bakery.
I like Ring Dings.
George, you can't show up at someone's house with Ring Dings and Pepsi.
Hey, your lights are on!
It's a funeral procession.
I got news for you.
I show up with Ring Dings and Pepsi I'm the hit of the party.
People would be coming up, "Between you and me I'm really excited about the Ring Dings and the Pepsi".
What are we, Europeans, with the Beaujolais and the chardonnay?
Oh, Kramer, that's the bakery.
Stop here.
Stop here.
-All right.
-Okay, let me out.
-You, whatever your name is.
-Jerry.
Yeah, Jerry.
Come with me.
We'll get the wine, pick you up here in 1 0 minutes?
-Yeah.
-All right.
I love the smell of bakeries.
Look, Elaine, the black-and-white cookie.
I love the black-and-white.
Two races of flavor living side by side in harmony.
It's a wonderful thing, isn't it?
You know, I often wonder what you'll be like when you're senile.
-I'm looking forward to it.
-Yeah.
It'll be a very smooth transition.
Thank you.
All right.
What are we getting?
Chocolate babka.
That's their specialty.
-Love that babka.
-Yeah, yeah.
But listen.
Elaine, when we get up to the door you hold the cake box.
-Why?
-I don't know.
Just standing there with a box, holding it by the little string.
-You think it's effeminate?
-It's a tad dainty.
Oh, we forgot to pick a number.
See, that's not fair.
We were here ahead of all these people.
You think I should go and ask her for hers?
-No, forget it.
-No, no, no.
It's not fair.
Just because they have a ticket doesn't mean they were here first.
We were ahead of them and them and her.
Come on, let's just go ask them.
Come on.
Excuse me.
Well, I'm not finding a spot here.
What do you wanna do?
-Just double-park.
-No.
-Why not?
-I'll get a ticket.
What if somebody wants to get out of here?
People get spaces this good, they never give them up.
That's a fallacy.
All right, I tell you what.
Go into the store, and I'll wait in the car.
Why don't you go into the store, and I'll wait in the car?
Because I've got the coat.
-I can sit in the car and not get cold.
-I'll leave the car heater running.
-Does the heater work in this car?
-No.
There's a spot right in front of the liquor store.
You see?
You see?
-But we were here ahead of you.
-How do I know that?
Well, we saw you come in.
-Well, that's easy for you to say.
-Oh, yeah, right.
That's something I do.
I make up stories to get ahead in lines at bakeries.
Forty-six.
Wait.
Wait a second.
Are you Barbara Benedict?
Yes.
Oh, my God.
I don't-- I know you.
I'm-- I'm Elaine Benes.
Do you remember?
We met at Linda van Grak's baby shower.
I'm on my way over there right now.
Yeah, me too.
-You're Jerry, right?
-David.
Well, this is a little awkward, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
You know, we were here ahead of you.
-You're not getting my number.
-So you still don't believe us.
-Forty-seven.
-That's us.
Oh, okay, fine.
Fine.
Go ahead.
But listen.
As soon as I get there I'm gonna tell everyone what a jerk you are.
I'll be there ahead of you and I'll be telling them what a jerk you are.
I'll have the chocolate babka.
You're lucky, Mrs. Benedict.
It's our last one.
All right, what are we getting?
It's hot in here.
What do you say we get a Mouton Cadet?
-What's that?
-It's a Bordeaux.
Robust, bold, very dry as opposed to a Beaujolais, which is richer and fruitier.
-All right, here's one.
Twelve dollars.
-Twelve dollars?
We should've gone to the bakery.
They're not getting no 1 2-dollar cake.
I'll pay you back later.
I don't have my wallet.
-Why not?
-I don't like to carry my wallet.
My osteopath says that it's bad for my spine.
Throws my hips off-kilter.
Throws your hips off-kilter.
-So where's your money?
-I never take it.
-So, what do you do?
-Oh, I get by.
See you later.
-See you later.
-See you later.
That's the last babka.
They got the last babka.
I know.
They're going in first with the last babka.
-That was our babka.
-You can't beat babka.
We had that babka.
They're gonna be heroes.
So, what now?
If we can't get the babka, the whole thing's useless.
-Well, how about a carrot cake?
-Carrot cake?
Why is that a cake?
You don't make carrots into a cake, I'm sorry.
-Black Forest?
-Black Forest?
Too scary.
You're in the forest.
-Hey, how about a napoleon?
-Napoleon?
Who's he to have a cake?
He was a ruthless warmonger.
Might as well get a Mengele.
That was our babka.
We had that babka.
-What's this one?
-That?
Cinnamon babka.
Another babka?
There's chocolate, and there's cinnamon.
Well, we gotta get the cinnamon.
Yeah, but they got the chocolate.
We'll be going in with lesser babka.
I beg your pardon.
Cinnamon takes a back seat to no babka.
People love it.
It should be on tables in restaurants with salt and pepper.
Someone says, "This is so good.
What's in this"?
The answer comes back, "Cinnamon, cinnamon," again and again.
Lesser babka?
I think not.
Forty-nine.
I'll have a cinnamon babka.
And a black-and-white cookie for me.
Peace.
That'll be 1 3.05.
All right, here you go.
A hundred.
I can't change that.
-You can't?
All right, let's go.
-Wait a second.
I can get change.
Hey, anybody got change for a hundred?
Are you crazy?
What are you doing?
-You're gonna get us killed.
-What?
Don't go shouting we got a $ 1 00 bill.
People will be all over us.
Let's buy something and we'll get change.
I am not buying something just to get change.
George, there's a newsstand right over there.
Now, come on.
-What are we doing?
-Just get some gum or something.
Pack of gum.
Here you go.
What, it's a hundred?
I can't change a hundred.
-Why not?
-You gotta buy more than that.
Here.
Get a newspaper.
-Newspaper.
-Not enough.
Clark Bar.
-Clark Bar.
-Keep going.
-I'm up to $2 here.
-Here.
-George, get a Penthouse Forum.
-I'm not getting a Penthouse Forum.
No, that'll make great dinner-party conversation.
We'll read the letters at the dinner table.
-Oh, that's nice.
-You ever read one of these?
It's not real.
They're all made up.
Oh, it's real.
You know, then there's an unusual number of people having sex with amputees.
Penthouse Forum.
Newspaper, gum, Clark Bar.
Six seventy-five.
Oh, great.
All right, with the wine, I'm in over $20 now.
-Big coat.
Big coat!
-Yes.
I'm sorry.
It's a new coat.
It's Gore-Tex.
We better be careful with that thing.
You'll start a war.
See, the key to eating a black-and-white cookie is you wanna get some black and some white in each bite.
Nothing mixes better than vanilla and chocolate.
And yet still somehow, racial harmony eludes us.
If people would only look to the cookie all our problems would be solved.
Well, your views on race relations are just fascinating.
You really should do an op-ed piece for The Times.
Look to the cookie, Elaine.
Look to the cookie.
What is this?
What?
It's a hair.
Take it back.
Get another one.
-No, we're late.
I'll take it off.
-Get another one.
It'll take a second.
All right, all right.
-Excuse me.
-Hey, hey.
-I'm on line here.
-No, no, we just bought this.
You sold us a cake with a hair on it.
You have to take a number.
We waited 1 5 minutes for this.
You sell me a cake with a hair on it and then you want me to wait?
What are you doing?
You're gonna wait now?
I'm not gonna eat a cake with a hair on it.
It was a little hair.
I took it off.
A little hair?
Do you think that makes it better?
-What if it's your hair?
-What if it's your hair?
What is wrong with my hair?
Nobody takes better care of their hair than me.
You can serve dinner on my head.
You use that misty herbal rainwater crap they sell in the health food store.
I use Prell, the hard stuff.
Hundred proof, takes your roots out.
Okay, fine.
We'll just wait till she calls the number.
Maybe we should forget about the cake.
No.
I'm bringing cake.
All right, we got the wine.
Aren't we lucky?
We got wine.
Imagine if we didn't bring the wine.
We'd be shunned by society.
Outcasts.
"Where's your wine?
Get out"!
"I know this is gonna sound like a crazy fantasy but every word of this story is true.
A few weeks ago, my girlfriend mentioned to me how attractive she thought our new neighbor, Linda, was".
Look-- Look at this.
Somebody double-parked and blocked us in.
Does anybody know whose car that is?
Maybe there's a note on it.
Oh, brother.
No.
No note.
-Can you believe this?
-"Of course, I noticed her too with those ample breasts and pouty lips.
I don't have to tell you she was a knockout".
I really cannot comprehend how stupid people can be sometimes.
-Can you comprehend it?
-No, I can't comprehend it.
We can put a man on the moon, but we're still basically very stupid.
The guy whose car this is could be the guy that built the rocket.
-You see what I'm saying?
-He could build the rocket.
He's still stupid for double-parking and blocking somebody in.
So you understand my point about building rockets and double-parking?
On one hand, he's smart with rockets.
On the other, he's dumb with parking.
It's cold out here, huh?
Maybe it's not stupidity.
Maybe it's just a blatant disregard for basic human decency.
This is how dictators start.
Think Mussolini would circle the block six times for a spot?
How about Idi Amin, huh?
If I was running for office, I'd ask for the death penalty for double-parkers.
If this is allowed to go on, this is not a society.
This is anarchy!
-Are those shoes comfortable?
-No, not really.
-They look comfortable.
-That's why I got them, but they're not.
Why couldn't we take the hair off and go?
-No.
That's out of the question.
-Why?
Because I had a bad experience with a hair when I was younger.
-What happened?
-I'd rather not talk about it.
-You can't tell me?
-All right.
I once found a hair in my farina, and I freaked out.
You found a hair in your farina?
Yeah.
-What happened?
-I screamed: "There's a hair in my farina.
There's a hair in my farina".
I ran out of the house.
I was running and running.
I was little, but I could run really fast.
And l-- I just kept running and they found me three hours later collapsed at a construction site.
-Whose hair was it?
-My mother's.
-Fifty-eight.
-That's us.
Oh, good.
You sold us a hair with a cake around it.
We'd like another one.
Oh, that's lovely.
That's what you wanna see, yeah.
Yeah, you wanna trade your hair for some phlegm.
You win the pennant with that trade.
Hair for phlegm.
Here you are.
Okay.
All right, we got the cake now.
Where is George and Kramer?
Hey, double-parker!
Show yourself!
Come on out, I'm freezing.
We are really late now.
-We're in big trouble.
Big trouble.
-Why?
You know, Elaine.
What about her?
I'm a little scared of her.
-You're scared of Elaine?
-Yes.
Why?
Did you ever see her lose her temper?
I was once late because I bought a Panama hat.
She pulled it down so hard my head came right through the top.
Let's go inside the liquor store.
I'm freezing.
-Why don't you wear a heavier coat?
-I wanted to look good for the party.
Hey, hey, hey.
That's great.
That's very nice.
We been waiting 20 minutes for you people.
-You think you're Mussolini?
-Back off, puffball, it's not my car!
I wasn't talking to you.
I'm going in.
Wait till I get my hands on that George.
I am gonna pull that big hood over his little head tie the strings and suffocate him.
You remember that Panama hat?
That was nothing.
What?
-What's the matter with you?
-I don't know.
I don't feel so good.
What's wrong?
My stomach.
I think it was that cookie.
-The black-and-white?
-Yeah.
Not getting along?
I think I got David Duke and Farrakhan down there.
If we can't look to the cookie, where can we look?
My stomach.
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.
-Wait.
What about your vomit streak?
-I know.
I haven't thrown up since June 29, 1 980.
-Sorry.
-Sorry?
You almost took my toe off.
Why don't you watch what you're doing, you lunatic.
Jerry, I think he broke my toe.
Where--?
Where you going?
Fourteen years down the drain.
You think chickens have individual personalities?
I don't know.
Could you tell five chickens apart just by the way they acted?
Or would they all be walking around: If they have individual personalities, I'm not sure we should be eating them.
What's the matter with you?
Can I help you guys with anything?
No, no.
We bought the wine here before.
We're blocked in by some car double-parked.
Just waiting for the guy to pull out.
Well, wait outside.
This isn't a hang out.
-But my friend here has hypothermia.
-Hypothermia.
All right, guys.
Take it outside.
You're paying for these.
-How was it?
-Good as it gets.
You know, that coat was Gore-Tex.
It's worth a hell of a lot more than that cheap chardonnay.
You know I'm freezing?
I'm definitely freezing.
I can't stop shaking.
I'm cold too.
At least you got a coat.
Let's get in the car.
Oh, my God.
That's Saddam Hussein, the dictator.
I told you.
I told you.
I wouldn't walk around without a coat.
You'll catch your death of cold.
So long.
Can I get you anything else?
-Oh, no, thanks.
-How about a nice box of scram?
Somebody double-parked.
We couldn't help it.
Might've been Saddam Hussein.
We're not sure.
He had a British accent, though.
What--?
What happened to you?
Somebody put a cane on my foot just like the one I'm gonna put up your-- Hey, what happened to your coat?
And what is that smell?
What, are you drunk?
-I had to give it to the liquor store guy.
-What for?
I spilled some chardonnay.
So, what did you get?
-Cinnamon babka.
-Cinnamon?
-Why didn't you get chocolate?
-George.
What?
What?
What?
Here.
Here's your cake.
And your wine.
-See you.
-See you.
I heard a weatherman say that 75 percent of your body heat is actually lost through the top of the head.
Which sounds like you could go skiing naked if you got a good hat.
But no hat makes a statement quite like the hat with the flaps.
The hat with the flaps makes a statement that no other hat makes.
This hat says to the world: "I would rather have the heat in my skull than anything society could possibly offer me".
In fact, if you're on trial for a serious crime and your lawyer recommends the insanity defense this is the hat to wear.
Your lawyer should really insist.
He should just go: "Your Honor, the defense rests".
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Aren't mannequins kind of an insult to your imagination?
You couldn't visualize a sweater so we'll show you on this life-size, snotty puppet.
When they're finished they become crash-test dummies.
The end of the line for a mannequin.
"Whatever happened to Bob"?
"Have you seen that new Volvo commercial?
He's got a bull's-eye right in his face".
Mannequins are only used for car accidents and fashion two situations that it's impossible for us to imagine ourselves: Well-dressed or getting killed.
I'm sure some pro-mannequin organization doesn't like the term "mannequin".
"Hey, they're not mannequins.
They're the life-deprived".
-That was really good.
-Yeah.
Are you full?
Oh, no.
I've had just enough.
Ah, here we go.
Apple pie.
Best apple pie in the city.
Delicious.
I'm not waiting for you.
Take some.
-No, thanks.
-You're not gonna have any?
-No.
-Do you not like apple pie?
-No.
It's not that.
-Well, at least taste it.
No.
-You won't even taste it?
-No.
Come on, try it.
A little taste.
Come on.
She wouldn't so much as taste it.
-Did she say why?
-No.
She just kept shaking her head like this: -Maybe she's diabetic.
-No.
She carries Entenmanns doughnuts in her purse.
Maybe you said something that offended her.
I told her we should have moving walkways all over city.
-Like at the airport?
-Yeah.
-That's a great idea.
-Tell me about it.
-We could be zipping everywhere.
-They could at least try it.
-They never try.
-What's the harm?
No harm!
I'm sorry.
There's no reason for her not to taste that pie.
-Who wouldn't taste the pie?
-Audrey.
Dump her.
I never broke up with anyone for not tasting pie.
I once broke up with someone for not offering me pie.
-You did?
-He could be eating a hero he wouldn't offer me anything.
It's a sickness.
Well, I can't walk anywhere now.
I'm just gonna be wishing there were walkways.
-What are you doing?
-I got a pebble.
I never heard of that happening to a woman.
What the hell does that mean?
Hey.
Oh, hey, Elaine.
-What?
-Go like this: -What?
Why?
-Do it, do it.
-Like this: -Like -like this?
-Oh, yeah!
It's you!
-What's me?
-There's a clothing store downtown.
They got a mannequin in there that looks exactly like Elaine.
-Get out!
-It's uncanny!
It's like they chopped off your arms and legs, dipped you in plastic screwed you all back together, and stuck you on a pedestal.
It's really quite exquisite.
-What's the name of the store?
-Rinitze.
Oh, yeah.
May I help you?
It's this itch.
I was watching TV without my shirt on and my couch cushion didn't have any fabric on it.
Wait a minute.
Rinitze.
Don't they have some really cool suits in there?
Real boss.
-I'm going down there.
-I'll go with you.
I gotta get a new suit.
I got a second interview with MacKenzie.
I think I'm really close.
They're taking me to lunch on Friday.
-Aren't you gonna need this?
-Keep it.
It looks exactly like me.
It's like some pod landed from another planet and took your body.
Don't fall asleep, Elaine.
What's going on?
How do you think this happened?
Whoa, look at this.
This is a beautiful suit, huh?
You think that could be a coincidence, George?
Is that possible?
You are perfect for that suit.
You think so?
Excuse me.
Where did this come from?
I don't know.
You really think this looks okay on me?
Fabulous.
Perfect fit.
And it's the last one we have.
I'm sorry.
You can't tell me where the mannequin came from?
I told you.
I don't know.
Well, is there somebody around here I could talk to who would know?
Why?
Isn't it obvious?
This mannequin looks exactly like me.
Did you just roll your eyes at him?
If anybody should be rolling their eyes it is me at him about you.
I think maybe you're flattering yourself.
That mannequin is wearing a $ 1 200 Gaultier dress.
What are you saying, that I'm not good enough for this hideous dress?
Listen, Natasha.
I wouldn't be caught dead wearing your crummy little Eurotrash rags.
I'll meet you outside.
-What is her problem?
-What can you do?
Is this the price tag?
-Yes.
-Yes, hello.
Party's over.
I'll tell you a little secret.
We're having an unadvertised sale starting Friday.
That suit will be half-price.
You think you could put it aside and hold it for me?
I'm afraid I couldn't do that.
It wouldn't be fair to the other customers.
Oh, yes, of course.
And we have to be fair.
So I found out who supplies the mannequins and I called him up.
-How did they get your face?
-I don't know, they wouldn't tell me.
Jerry?
Hello?
Excuse me.
I noticed you offered her a piece of your pie.
That's right.
-And you waved it away.
-Right.
-Did you give her a reason?
-Yes.
-I was full.
-You were full.
So you gave a reason.
You didn't just shake your head.
-No.
I'm not a psycho.
-Exactly.
You're not a psycho.
You've been very helpful.
Thank you very much.
Allow me to leave the tip.
Well, I think we've proven who the psycho is.
We certainly have.
Hey, Elaine, scratch my back.
-No way.
-One lap around.
-No.
-It'll be a funky adventure.
-Kramer, forget it.
-Jerry, how about you?
I think you know my policy.
I'm going home to spatula.
I thought George was meeting us here.
No.
He's going downtown to guard the suit.
He's guarding a suit?
Do you need some help with that itch?
Madam, I pray you're not toying with me.
-Turn around.
-Oh, all right.
-It fits you perfectly.
-You think so?
What is this?
Can't I leave this place for a second?
Can I help you?
I'm buying this suit.
-No.
This suit is not for sale.
-Excuse me, do you work here?
No.
Then what the hell business is it of yours?
I'm doing you a favor.
They're having an unadvertised sale.
This suit will be half-price starting Monday.
-Really?
This Monday?
-Yes.
Take off those pants.
Actually, the unadvertised sale starts on Friday.
Friday?
Thanks.
You know, for an unadvertised sale, you're doing a lot of yapping about it.
I can't believe your father owns this place.
So how are the desserts here?
Everything is delicious.
-You've tasted them?
-I think almost all of them.
Oh, I see they have apple pie.
-You've had the apple pie?
-Many times.
Audrey, I gotta be honest with you.
I'm a very curious guy.
It's my nature.
I need to know things.
Not tasting the apple pie the other day, I can't get past it.
You obviously like pies.
You carry doughnuts in your bag.
You're not averse to pastry.
Surely you could see how such a thing would prey on my mind.
-Can we drop this?
-Why can't I know?
-Oh, Poppie.
-Sweetheart, hello.
Poppie, this is Jerry.
-Welcome.
-Hello, Poppie.
Don't fill up on the bread.
I'm making you a very special dinner.
Very special.
The pies.
I'm going to the bathroom.
You know.
Ah, Jerry!
Tonight you're in for a real treat.
I'm personally gonna prepare the dinner for you and my Audrey.
Jerry, are you okay?
Is anything wrong?
No.
Nothing.
You look like you've seen a ghost.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Hey.
-These are for you, Olive.
-Thank you.
Here it is.
Oh, wait till you taste this.
Poppie, this is perfect.
Well?
Jerry, have some.
You're not gonna taste it?
Jerry.
So she thought I did it to get back at her.
Why didn't you just tell her?
It's not the kind of thing you wanna hear about your father.
When he came out of that bathroom, and he was kneading that dough it was a wild scene.
How could he not have washed?
Even if you're not gonna soap up at least pretend, for my benefit.
Turn the water on.
Do something.
Yeah, just like I do.
You know, a chef who doesn't wash is like a cop who steals.
It's a cry for help.
He wants to get caught.
I think Poppie's got some problems.
There's a whole other thing going on with Poppie.
-So how did you leave it?
-We haven't spoken.
Hey.
Hey, George.
I'm not gonna need this anymore.
I got Olive.
-Olive?
-My lady friend down at Monk's.
You guys ought to see the way she works her nails across my back.
She's a maestro-- The crisscross the figure eight, strumming the old banjo and this wild, savage free-for-all where anything can happen.
I gotta get downtown and buy that suit.
-Store opens in 20 minutes.
-Is that Elaine mannequin still there?
Yeah.
The last time I saw her she was naked.
Yeah.
And Poppie's got problems.
Where is it?
Where is it?
Well, look at this.
This doesn't belong here.
Someone has made a terrible mistake.
You bastard!
-You hid the suit.
-Hid?
I have no idea how this suit got misplaced.
Nevertheless, I do believe I shall purchase it.
I hope you rot in that suit.
I'll get you for this.
I don't know how, but I'm gonna get you.
-You are gonna pay.
-Oh, I'll pay.
Half-price.
Arrivederci, my fellow 40-short.
I made a list of people who might have made the mannequin.
You know, possible suspects.
-Yeah, all right.
Go ahead.
-Okay.
All right, well, there's this blind guy at a party I was at and he felt my face for a really long time to see what I looked like.
He almost put his finger up my nose.
-What else you got?
-Okay.
I won't tell you the rest of the list.
Because I didn't think the blind guy did it?
Because you have an attitude.
Oh, Georgie.
-Nice duds.
-You're telling me.
So, what do you think?
-Did you hear something?
-Yeah, like a swoosh.
Yeah.
It must be the fabric.
It's rubbing between your thighs when you walk.
That's what's making that swooshy sound.
I didn't hear it on the way over because of the street noise.
This is no good!
I gotta meet these guys from MacKenzie for lunch!
So what?
What would they care?
This MacKenzie guy, he's a bit of a nut.
He fired the last guy because his nose whistled when he breathed.
So you're not gonna get the job because your pants make noise?
Let's say it's between me and one other guy.
He's got a quiet suit, and I'm whooshing all over the place!
Who do you think he's gonna hire?
All these interviews are making you nuts.
Jerry, I saw your girlfriend was in here before.
-Audrey?
-Sat down, had herself a piece of pie.
-Was it apple?
-What else?
This woman is bending my mind into a pretzel.
Do I know you?
No, you don't.
Yeah.
You were wearing a G-string and one of those bras with points.
The mannequin!
Oh, I gotta see this thing.
Boy, the resemblance is uncanny.
You think you can pose me however you want?
That's my ass in your window.
It's our mannequin.
We can do whatever we want.
No.
You take that mannequin down right now or I am pressing charges.
Yes.
This is my attorney.
Yeah?
What law am I breaking?
I believe there is some legal precedent Winchell v. Mahoney.
The Charlie McCarthy hearings.
-Are you taking this down?
-I'm getting the manager.
-Jerry, get the car.
-What are you doing?
-Just get the car.
-As your legal counsel I must advise against this.
I don't know about you, but I'm getting a hankering for some Doublemint gum.
I'm dropping you off at work, right?
Where are you going?
Poppie's.
Thanks for meeting me down here, George.
My office is out of control.
Phones ringing, people running in and out.
Did you hear something?
No, I didn't hear anything.
That's strange.
It's quieter down here.
We can concentrate without people whooshing around.
That sound again.
Sure you didn't hear anything?
No, can't say as I did.
Kind of like a rustling.
Could be the leaves.
That's right.
Poppie's on 7 7th.
Okay.
We'll see you at 8.
Bye-bye.
Hello.
-What are you doing here?
-So how was the pie?
-What pie?
-The apple pie you had today at Monk's.
-I'm very busy here.
-Pretty good, wasn't it?
I told you you should've tasted it.
You better not let Poppie see you.
All right, I'm looking for Poppie.
-Who are you?
-Board of Health.
-We've had complaints.
-Oh, about the, uh.
-You Poppie?
-I'm Poppie.
Think you better come with me.
What's the problem?
What do they want from Poppie?
Well, Poppie's a little sloppy.
You thought I'd care about your pants whooshing?
I heard the last guy got fired because his nose whistled.
No.
He got fired because he wasn't a team player.
That's something we don't joke about at MacKenzie.
We're a team here.
We don't tolerate dissent.
You wanna go your own way, you're in the wrong place.
No problem there.
Conformity's an obsession with me.
Chocolate cream pie, compliments of the house.
Hope you saved room for dessert.
The chef said that he made it special for you.
Best pie I've ever tasted.
Take a bite, George.
Take a bite.
It's delicious.
I insist.
If you're one of us, you'll take a bite.
-So you didn't get the job?
-No.
But I was the only one at the table that didn't get violently ill.
Kramer, you can't keep avoiding her like this.
-You have to say something.
-What?
-Tell her you lost your itch.
-What happened to it?
I lost it two days ago.
I've been faking it so I wouldn't hurt her feelings.
You should tell her.
I'll let her down easy.
All right.
Well.
Hi, Olive.
No, no.
No more of that.
-There's something I have to tell you.
-What?
Well, there's someone else.
-Someone else?
-Yeah.
Who is she?
Her.
-Her?
-Yeah.
There she is.
-That's my gal.
-You're a liar.
I've seen her before.
She's not your girlfriend.
Now, Olive, look, I'm sorry.
Why is she wearing her underwear?
Well, it's a style.
Jerry, give me the keys.
Well, I guess we're gonna go for a drive now.
She really loves that.
You ever solve the riddle of the pie?
No, that's one for the ages.
But I think they're gonna put Poppie away for a long, long time.
You're not gonna believe this.
I just got a letter from a friend of mine in Chicago who was shopping, and she saw a mannequin that looked just like me.
What if there are more?
Where are they coming from?
Ricky, we've been getting a tremendous response to your TR-6 mannequin.
TR-6?
I prefer to think of her as Elaine.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
The bus is the single stupidest, fattest slowest, most despised vehicle on the road, isn't it?
Ever notice when you get behind a bus, people go: "What are you doing?
Get away.
Come on".
The back of the bus, it's like an eclipse, isn't it?
People are just like, "The sun.
Where is the sun"?
It's like this huge metal ass just taking up the whole windshield of your car.
When it pulls out, it even sounds like a fat uncle trying to get out of a sofa.
-It's just not good.
It's not good.
-It's not good.
I'm bored.
She's boring, I'm boring.
We're both boring.
We go out to eat, read newspapers.
-At breakfast, everybody reads.
-No, lunch, we read.
-Dinner, we read.
-You read during lunch?
-Yeah.
-Oh, well.
-Nothing to talk about.
-What's there to talk about?
At least we're talking about how there's nothing.
Talk with her about how there's nothing.
She knows there's nothing.
-At least she'll be talking.
-Oh, shut up.
-Hey, look who's here.
-Hey, Al.
-Hey, Al.
How's it going?
-Deeply in love.
We have so many things to talk about.
Sometimes, we'll talk all night till the sun comes up.
-So how about you?
-Oh, I'm seeing someone, yes.
-You know her.
Daphne Bauer.
-Great girl.
We have no need to speak.
We communicate with deep, soulful looks.
Like Dwight and Mamie Eisenhower.
-Did you hear about Fulton?
-Yeah.
Yeah, I went by the hospital to see him a few days ago.
Think he'd really like you to visit.
-Me?
-Yeah.
-Said he could use a good laugh.
-What about me?
He didn't mention you.
This is my stop.
-See you.
-Yeah, see you.
"Deeply in love".
You can't say something bad about relationships you shouldn't say anything at all.
I didn't know Fulton was in the hospital.
"Could use a good laugh".
You know what pressure that is?
Come on, come with me.
I'm not good in these situations.
l-- I can't hide my pity.
l-- I make them feel worse.
-Oh, stop it.
-Also, I'm afraid that people in that state are finally gonna tell me what they really think.
They got nothing to lose.
What do they care?
-So you're not gonna come?
-No, but say hello for me.
-Hey.
-Hey.
-Hey, Mick.
-Hey, Jerry.
-What's doing?
-Nothing.
You?
Same old, same old.
George, this is Mickey.
-Hi.
Nice to meet you.
-Pleasure.
-How's work going, you guys?
-Let's not talk about it.
-You got a job?
-Yeah.
Mickey hooked me up.
We're stand-ins for the actors on All My Children.
Mickey's a stand-in for an 8-year-old kid and I stand in for the kid's father.
But I got a big problem.
The kid I stand in for, he's growing.
He was 4 feet last month.
Now he's like 4'2" and a half.
He shot up 2 and a half inches.
I can do 4'2", 4'3" is a stretch.
Any higher, I'm gonna be out on my ass doing that paralegal crap.
How do you stop a kid from growing?
I told you, you should offer him some cigarettes.
I offered him cigarettes but his stupid mother's always hanging around.
She won't let him have any.
-What about lifts?
-Out of the question.
Can't you just switch with another midget?
It's "little people".
-You got that?
-Easy, Mickey.
Easy.
Yeah.
We gotta get back to the show.
What are you guys doing?
-Going to the hospital to visit Fulton.
-Well, say hello for me.
Now, look.
We're gonna stop at the shoemaker right now.
You gotta get some lifts for your shoes.
Lifts?
Kramer, you don't understand.
This kind of thing is just not done.
-You wanna keep your job?
-Yeah, but-- -No buts.
-Kramer-- Hey.
Fulton!
It's me.
Hey, Jerry.
Good to see you.
-I could use a good laugh.
-Who couldn't?
-I haven't cracked a smile in months.
-Oh, don't worry.
You'll crack.
Cracking's inevitable.
First you crack, then you chuckle.
That was the Russians' motto at the Siege of Leningrad: First you crack, then you chuckle.
You know, because Leningrad when the Nazis attacked, it wasn't a very happy time.
Because of the war.
Famine.
Plus, it was cold.
Very cold.
They were eating each other.
Maybe this isn't a good time for a visit.
No, it's a fine time.
All right.
There's a priest, a minister and a rabbi, and they're all skydiving.
So how are the eggs?
Eggs are eggs.
Eggs are eggs.
That is very profound.
By the same token, could you say, "Fish is fish"?
I don't think so.
-Listen, Daphne-- -Daphne.
Daphne.
I have to tell you something.
This is very difficult-- Oh, I forgot to tell you.
Al Nechy called me today.
Yeah.
I bumped into him on the bus.
What did he have to say?
He told me not to get involved with you.
-What?
-Yeah.
He said you could never make a commitment and you'd just wind up hurting me.
He said that?
What a nerve.
How dare he say something like that.
-Is it true?
-Of course not.
I mean, sure, there may have been one or two occasions in the past when I may have reacted in an impulsive or somewhat immature manner but those days are well behind me.
How long are you gonna be away for, Daddy?
I'm not really going away.
I told you, I'll be back every other weekend.
Don't go, Daddy.
Don't go.
Now, Porter you know your mother and I love you very much but sometimes people fall out of love.
Now, give me a big hug.
And there's your scene.
-Stand-ins?
-Yo.
All right, you guys.
Get on their spots.
We gotta fix the lights.
That's good work.
All right.
Ready.
How long you gonna be away for, Daddy?
I'm not really going away.
I told you I'd be back every other weekend.
Don't go, Daddy.
Don't go.
Now, listen, Porter.
You know your mother and I love you very much but sometimes people fall out of love.
Now, give me a big hug.
All right.
Kramer.
Kramer.
Okay, that's lunch, everybody.
One hour.
-How do those lifts feel?
-Quiet.
-Hi, guys.
-Hey, Tammy.
You look different.
-Have you been working out?
-Not that I know of.
Whatever it is, keep doing it.
You look great.
-How about lunch?
-Oh, I can't today but I see it in our future.
-See you, Kramer.
-Yeah.
Bye, Mickey.
-Oh, she likes you, buddy.
-Yeah.
Yeah.
-All of a sudden.
-What?
Hey, Mick.
-How you doing, Johnny?
-What gives?
What's going on?
-You going out with Tammy?
-Maybe.
What's it to you?
There's something different about you.
-I got my hair cut, that's all.
-No, that's not it.
Something else.
Yeah.
You look different.
You don't.
You got the same ugly mug you had since the day I met you.
I don't know what it is, but I'll find out.
I'll find out.
Don't believe him.
So she's just sitting there, and then Pachyderm-- You remember the 'Derm.
He says, "I'm gonna go up to her".
So he picks up the two pieces of pizza and.
And they're steaming hot.
They're burning his hands, so he's juggling.
He's throwing them in the air.
And just as he gets up to her, down they go.
Well, we all just lost it.
It was really, really funny.
-Hey, Jerry.
-Hey, Phil.
How you doing?
-You look terrific.
-I got my health.
Well, that's the most important thing.
Hey, how you doing, Fulton?
Octane, butane, night train!
-How's he doing?
-He could use a couple laughs.
You should've told the story about Pachyderm dropping the pizza.
I told it.
Yeah.
-Yeah.
-Yeah.
Hey, you know what?
As I was leaving, I saw Phil Tatola.
He is one of the greatest guys.
-Do I know him?
-No.
But of all the guys I know I could envision you going out with him.
If you were a woman, would you go out with him?
If I was a woman, I'd be at the dock waiting for the fleet to come in.
Yeah, I bet you would.
All right, give him my number.
All right.
This, you're not gonna believe.
Al Nechy, that pimple tells Daphne-- Now, get this.
--not to get involved with me.
-What?
-Yeah.
That's what she told me.
-Why?
-He's afraid that she's gonna get hurt.
-Is she?
-Of course.
-So?
-What?
He doesn't have to tell her.
-Maybe he likes her.
-Oh, no, no.
He's deeply in love.
I was about to break up with her when she told me.
-So, what are you gonna do?
-I can't break up with her now.
-Why?
-Because he said I was going to.
So now you're gonna keep going out with her for spite?
-Yes.
I am.
-Yeah, I could see that.
-I don't see any way around it.
-Me either.
-What choice do I have?
-None.
Fulton's wife told me it's all my fault.
She said since my visit, he's taken a turn for the worse.
-Did you tell him the Pachyderm story?
-Yeah, I told him the Pachyderm story.
Maybe I'll go over there.
-Towards what end?
-I'm very good with sick people.
They love me.
When my friend Len Nickidimo had gout I was in his hospital room for three days.
The doctors were amazed at his recovery.
-Hey.
-Hey, Mick.
Johnny Viggiano went through my locker.
That little bastard.
He saw the lifts in my shoes.
He knows I'm heightening.
This never would've happened if you didn't push me to get those.
-I told you.
-Nobody put a gun to your head.
Yeah.
Just keep out of my business, you big ape.
Who you calling "big ape"?
I'm calling you an ape.
All right, break it up.
Come on, you two.
Just cut it out now.
Yeah.
Behave yourselves.
-I'm sorry, Kramer.
-No, it's all right, it's all right.
You're stressed out.
Why does this Johnny have it in for you?
He's always been jealous of me.
I always got to stand in for the bigger stars.
The Cosby kids, Ricky Schroder, Macaulay Culkin.
-What's he like?
-He's a good kid.
-Yeah?
-What does he care if you put lifts in?
You don't understand.
There's an unwritten code about this.
I could be ostracized.
I remember when I was a kid, some guy tried to heighten.
He lost his job, lost his friends, everything.
I knew I was crazy to try this kind of thing but I was so desperate.
What is this kid taking, anyway?
Hormones?
Steroids?
Would you tell me?
Well, here we are.
George, tomorrow's Sunday.
We could sleep late and get the paper and have breakfast and spend the morning together go for a long walk, maybe do a little shopping -have lunch-- -You know what?
l-- I don't think I'm gonna be able to stay over tonight.
-Why not?
-Yeah, I really should go home.
Actually, I'm planning on spending the day with my father.
We're-- We're going to a father-son picnic, just the two of us.
I thought we were gonna spend the day together.
Well, Dad's been planning this for such a long time.
He bought a new blanket.
And he got that game with the foam paddles and the Velcro ball.
Have you given any more thought to what we talked about?
You know, moving in?
Yes.
Oh, yes.
Very much.
Maybe you don't wanna move in.
No, no, I do.
You know, it's just-- Maybe Al Nechy was right.
Maybe I shouldn't have gotten involved.
No, he's not right.
Al Nechy is not right.
All right, I'm canceling the father-son picnic.
I don't know what he's gonna do with all that potato salad.
So then Pachyderm picks up the two pieces of pizza.
And mind you, now, they're burning hot.
He can barely hold them.
He's trying to, like, juggle the pizza.
You know.
I mean-- -And then they go flying-- -I'm gonna pee my pants.
They go flying out of his hands.
And one lands on her face, and the other lands on his face.
I mean, the whole place went crazy.
-Oh, what a story.
-Oh, God.
I know.
I know.
That is one of the funniest stories -I've ever heard.
-I know.
Well, this has been one hell of a night.
I'm sorry Jerry didn't suggest this sooner.
You know you really are beautiful, Elaine.
Well.
-Good night.
-Good night?
Well.
Come on, Adrian.
Give me another chance.
I know I can cheer Fulton up.
I'll tell you what.
I'll do my act.
No, new material.
He's never heard it.
He'll love it.
I just did it at the Concorde last week.
It killed.
Thank you.
Thanks-- You will not regret this.
Okay.
Bye.
Hey.
Hello.
So?
-What?
-Come on, how was your date?
Oh, the date.
The date.
-Yeah.
How was it?
-Interesting.
-Really?
-Oh, yeah.
-Why?
What happened?
-Let's see.
How shall I put this?
Well, just put it.
He took it out.
He what?
He took it out.
He took what out?
It.
He took it out?
Yes, sirree, Bob.
-He couldn't.
-He did.
You were involved in some sort of amorous-- No.
-You mean, he just--?
-Yes.
-Are you sure?
-Oh, quite.
There was no mistaking it?
Jerry.
So you were talking, you're having a pleasant conversation -and then all of a sudden-- -Yeah.
-It.
-It.
-Out.
-Out.
Well, I can't believe this.
I know Phil.
He's a good friend.
We play softball together.
-How could this be?
-Oh, it be.
Have you got any other friends you wanna set me up with?
Hey.
Hey, how was your date with Phil Tatola?
He took it out.
Well, maybe it needed some air.
You know, sometimes they need air.
They can't breathe in there.
It's inhuman.
So she's just sitting there, she's having a pleasant conversation -and all of a sudden-- -It.
-It.
-Out.
I spend time trying to get their clothes off I never thought of taking mine off.
Hey, get out of here.
Daphne's gonna be here.
All right, I'm going.
You know what I've come to realize?
I'm not just bored.
I genuinely dislike her.
Well, how long are you gonna keep this up?
Hey, I'll get married if I have to.
Al Nechy will think twice before he opens his mouth about me again.
George, they're doing wonderful things at mental institutions these days.
I'd be happy to set up a meet-and-greet.
I'm very disappointed to hear you talk like that.
-Still don't know what makes me tick.
-Yes, I do.
-What are you doing?
-I'm going to see Fulton.
I'm not even saying hello.
I'm going right into material.
-Hey, Jer.
-Oh, hey, Phil.
I'm sorry things didn't work out with Elaine.
I don't know what I did wrong.
Well, you showed her who you are.
Oh, look at this.
What, she's gotta breast-feed in public?
Yeah, that's the last thing you wanna see.
Well, next to last.
-Look, I'll see you.
-Yeah, take it easy.
Dr. Callahan.
Dr. Callahan.
Hey, how you doing?
Good to be here.
-Rock, paper, scissors.
Match.
-Rock, paper, scissors.
Match.
All right.
Rock beats paper.
I thought paper covered rock.
No.
Rock flies right through paper.
Well, what beats rock?
Nothing beats rock.
All right, come on.
Rock, paper, scissors.
Match.
-Rock.
-Rock.
Rock, paper, scissors.
Match.
-Rock.
-Rock.
Hey, Bob.
Hey, what's with you?
You got a problem?
-You see that look he gave me?
-Come on.
Here.
Ready?
Rock, paper, scissors.
Match.
-Rock.
-Rock.
-Hey, Tammy.
-Hello.
So, Tammy, finally, today's our big lunch.
-I don't think so.
-Why not?
-What the hell are you talking about?
-Look, Mickey.
Everybody knows that you're heightening.
It's all over the set.
-Wait.
Wait-- -Don't touch me.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
All the progress we've made over the years and you blow it with a stupid stunt like that.
Wait a second.
Wait a second.
You got me all wrong.
It was all because of the kid.
The kid was growing.
He shot up 2 and a half inches in a month.
I would've lost my job.
Any one of you would've done the same.
You got no right.
I'm Mickey Abbot.
I stood in for Punky Brewster when all of you was nothing.
It's all his fault.
It was his idea.
Come on, Johnny.
Let's go get something to eat.
Mickey.
-This guy's belching up vitamins.
-Stop.
And this whole Justice League Batman, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman.
You mean to tell me Superman can't cover everything?
-Stop.
-For crying out loud, he's Superman.
Fulton?
Fulton?
George, first let me just say that I've never been with a guy who was so committed to commit.
I mean, it's so rare in men these days and that's what makes this all the more difficult.
Difficult?
The other day after work, some girlfriends and I went to a bar for some drinks, and there was this crazy mishap and I wound up meeting someone as a result.
George.
Please don't.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm afraid the worst of it is it's someone you know.
Jerry Persach.
Pachyderm?
He was carrying these two pieces of pizza.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Of all the places you go the dry cleaning relationship's the most bizarre.
You keep giving each other the same thing back and forth over and over again.
He gives it to you, you give it to him, he gives it back to you.
It's like it's half his shirt, in a way.
He has it as much as you do.
You ought to go shopping with him.
"What do you think of this shirt"?
"That would look good with a light starch".
The only warning label people respect is "dry-clean only".
Speed limits, lung cancer, cigarette warnings your very life is at stake.
People go, "Ah, the hell with it".
But dry-clean only?
"Don't put that in the wash.
It's dry-clean only.
Are you crazy"?
-Good morning.
-Good morning.
-How did you sleep?
-You're on the couch tonight.
-You were all over my side.
-I was not.
I was sleeping with one cheek off the bed.
By the way, you're falling way behind on the "I love you's".
-No, no, 1 2-8.
-No, it's 1 5-8.
I know I can't beat you.
I'm trying to stay competitive.
-Let's get some breakfast.
-Let me get a coat.
I think I'll try a sports jacket and scarf thing.
You know, like an unemployed actor.
I haven't worn this one in a long time.
-Cashmere?
-No, Gore-Tex.
It's new.
Look at this locket.
What the hell's this?
There's a picture in here.
Look at that.
This is really old.
You don't know whose it is?
I haven't worn this jacket since I had it dry-cleaned.
-Maybe we should ask.
-We'll stop over there.
-What do you wanna get for breakfast?
-Pancakes.
Come on, you know I'm getting pancakes.
-I don't know that.
-We can't both get pancakes.
It's embarrassing.
That's one step from the couples that dress alike.
-I'll get the short stack.
-That's why I love you.
-How you doing?
-We just got back from breakfast.
-Pancakes were dynamite.
-Is that my maple syrup?
Yeah.
-You bring your own syrup?
-You got to.
You got a lot to learn about pancakes.
This is my wife.
She died eight years ago.
I've been looking all over for this.
It's lucky that I put the jacket on.
How did it get in the pocket?
The chain is broken.
It must have slipped in when I was.
I turned my house upside down looking for this.
-It's all I have left of her.
-That's so touching.
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna give you and your family -Oh, come on.
It's silly.
-Forget it.
-Get out of here.
-It's done.
All right.
I guess I get it too, because I'm his wife.
I didn't know you were married.
Oh, yeah.
You never met my wife, Meryl.
Meryl Seinfeld.
Yeah, sure.
You get the discount too.
You might regret that.
The money my wife -spends on clothes-- -I'm taking him to the cleaners.
See her sense of humor?
I'm so nuts about you.
I tell you, it was fun being single.
But when you meet a woman like this, you don't walk to get married.
You run.
Oh.
Hi, Greg.
-Haven't seen you in a while.
-Yeah.
Today was the first day I've worked out since the Central Park mini-marathon.
-You ran the mini-marathon?
-No, but I exercised that day.
I gotta take off.
As an airline pilot, you're one of the few people who can say that and mean it.
-Do you have the time?
-Eleven-thirty.
-Eleven-thirty?
-Wait, wait, 1 0:30.
Sorry.
-You have to be somewhere?
-No.
-What are you doing?
-Just waiting for my friend George.
We worked out together.
-Well, it's good seeing you.
-Nice to see you too.
Bye.
Would you?
-Can l--?
-Pardon?
The syrup.
Would you pass the syrup?
Oh, you want to try the syrup.
Can I get you anything else?
Yeah.
My wife and I will have a little more coffee.
-Okay.
-And the check for my husband.
To my beautiful wife.
To my adoring husband.
-Adoring?
What about handsome?
-I like adoring.
Yeah, sure.
Adoring's good for you.
What's it do for me?
Excuse me.
Where did you get that?
l-- Well-- We don't allow any outside syrups jams, or condiments in the restaurant.
And if I catch you in here with that again I will confiscate it.
Well, I told my wife not to bring it.
Really?
Twenty-five percent off?
-Do I get that too?
-No.
Just Meryl.
-Why does she get it?
-Because she's my wife.
Yeah?
I tell you, I'm really enjoying this marriage thing.
You think about each other.
You care about each other.
It's wonderful.
I love saying "My wife".
Once I started saying it, I can't stop.
"My wife" this, "my wife" that.
It's an amazing way to begin a sentence.
"My wife has an inner ear infection".
-See?
-I like that.
Will you do me a favor?
Will you take my quilt into the cleaners so I can get the discount too?
We'll start doing this now?
I can't be taking -all your dry cleaning in.
-Just this one time.
It's expensive.
Hey, Elaine.
What do you say, if neither of us is married in 1 0 years -we get hitched?
-Let's make it 50.
We're engaged.
All right, I'm gonna get my quilt.
All right.
Listen to this.
Remember that guy at the health club?
The flyboy.
Where's George?
-I thought he was with you.
-He didn't show up.
Anyway, this guy gave me an open-lip kiss.
-So?
-So?
We've always just kind of pecked.
This one had a different dynamic.
-Really?
-Yeah.
I mean.
His upper lip landed flush on my upper lip but his lower lip landed well below my rim.
-Moisture?
-Yeah.
Definite moisture.
-That's an open-lip kiss, all right.
-Yeah.
I think he's giving me a big signal.
Maybe he wants to change our relationship.
Yeah.
-It's George.
-Hey, what happened to you?
Nothing.
A little problem.
What was it?
I mean, I was waiting.
Can I come upstairs, please?
Maybe he wants to ask me out.
Why are you interested?
He's a jerk.
Because he doesn't pay any attention to me, and he ignores me.
-Yeah, so?
-I respect that.
What happened?
Nothing, I said it was a little problem.
Yeah, what was it?
I was in the locker room showering, and I -I had to go, so-- -Here we go.
Anyway, I think the guy in the shower opposite saw me.
He even gave me a dirty look.
You went in the shower?
Yeah, so what?
I'm not the only one.
-Do you go in the shower?
-No, never.
-Do you?
-I take baths.
What was I supposed to do?
Get out of the shower, put on my bathrobe go to the other end, come all the way back?
Did you ever hear of holding it in?
Oh, no.
That's very bad for the kidneys.
-How do you know?
-Medical journals.
Do the medical journals mention anything about standing in a pool of someone else's urine?
Hello.
-Oh, hi, honey.
-What are you doing here?
I just thought I'd drop off a few things.
I must have been in the incinerator room when you left.
Here you go, Marty.
Another quilt?
-Jerry.
-Uncle Leo.
-Hello.
-Hello.
If you or your wife want to drop by on Wednesday-- Your wife?
Yeah.
My wife.
What are you talking about?
I got married.
You got married?
I wasn't invited?
Nobody sends me an invitation?
Well, it was sudden.
Are you ashamed of your uncle?
Do I embarrass you?
No, no.
It was a small ceremony.
Haven't I always been the good uncle?
Yes, yes, you have.
Who told you when you went to school that you print well?
You did.
When he was younger, he had a beautiful penmanship.
I used to encourage him to print.
-I'm a good printer.
-I remember your "V".
It was like a perfect triangle.
-Oh, there's my bus.
-There you go.
-Hello!
Wait!
-Uncle Leo.
Uncle-- I'm glad you're here.
This can get really boring.
You know where I can get some good olives?
-I can find out.
-Would you?
Sure.
Oh, a project.
That's a definite signal.
By the way, you look really great in that leotard.
Thanks.
That's no signal.
Who wouldn't like me in this leotard?
I look amazing in this leotard.
It's weird.
I think I had a dream about you last night.
Okay, he open-lips me, he dreams about me we have an olive project, that's it.
I'm asking this guy out.
-You know, Greg-- -Can I have a sip of water?
-Yeah, sure.
-Thanks.
Oh, my God.
-I'm sorry.
What were you saying?
-It was nothing.
Forget it.
See that guy right there?
-Yeah.
You mean him?
-Yeah.
I caught him urinating in the shower.
I'm thinking about turning him in too.
Honey, could you get me something to drink?
-You're right there.
-Come on, I'm sitting.
Honey, what did you do with the can opener?
-I didn't do anything with it.
-It's not here.
It was here yesterday.
-It's in the first drawer.
-I'm looking in the first drawer.
-It's not here.
-Yes, it is.
Hey, I'm not stupid.
I'm looking in that drawer.
There's no can opener.
-Did I say you were stupid?
-Well, wouldn't I have to be?
You tell me there's a can opener in the drawer I'm looking, there's no can opener.
What other conclusion could one reach?
-You want me to go find it?
-Yes, I do.
You show me where there's a can opener in that drawer.
Hello.
I'm sorry.
I'm just fighting with my wife.
Jerry, we just heard.
What's going on?
Why didn't you tell us?
-Listen, Mom-- -It was in here yesterday.
Yeah.
That's what I said.
Who is she?
When did this happened?
I told her you'd get married.
She thought you'd never do it.
-Morty, you're talking too loud.
-I'm not.
-You're hurting my eardrum.
-You must've done something with it.
I'm on the phone.
Is she there?
Can we talk to her?
What's her name?
Mom, I'm not married.
-What?
-I'm not married.
I knew it.
I told you.
Uncle Leo said.
I'm just pretending I'm married to get a discount on dry cleaning.
A discount on dry cleaning?
Could you make a little more noise?
I'll have to call you later.
Well, I give up.
Well, whoopee-woo.
-You got any coffee?
-Yeah.
Oh, boy.
I'll get it, I'll get it.
Take it easy.
Why are you so tired?
My quilt is still at the cleaners.
Jerry, I can't sleep without my quilt.
The other night I was cold, so last night I turned up the heat, it's too hot.
I opened up a window, it's too cold.
I can't get into the zone.
What is that?
That.
I forgot.
I'm sorry about all that can opener stuff.
Yeah.
Me too.
-I love you.
-I love you.
-Well, good night.
-Good night.
They could kick me out if he tells them.
What do you want me to do?
-Talk to him.
-How can I do that?
You said the guy gave you an open-lipped kiss.
But then he wiped his hand on the top of the bottle when I offered him water.
That doesn't mean anything.
Are you kidding?
That's very significant.
If he was interested in me, he'd want my germs.
He'd just crave my germs.
She's right, George.
Bottle-wipe is big.
What about the open-lip kiss?
Bottle-wipe supersedes it.
Yeah, you're right.
You're right.
Maybe he's not interested, but you still know him.
-Can't you just ask him?
-George.
But if I ask him now I will have no chance of going out with him.
Why?
I don't know.
Could it be because you don't want him to know that your friend pees in the shower?
-That's not it.
-I think it is.
-That's exactly what it is.
-Why couldn't you wait?
I was there.
I saw a drain.
-Since when is a drain a toilet?
-It's all pipes.
-What's the difference?
-Different pipes go to different places.
-You're gonna mix them up.
-I'll call a plumber right now.
-Can we just drop the pee-pipes stuff?
-Okay.
Okay, okay, I will talk to him.
-Jerry, I think that quilt is ready.
-All right.
-You gotta pick it up.
-I'll pick it up.
-But it's the last time I'm doing it.
-I'm so tired.
-You don't look good.
-Huh?
I don't?
-No.
You look pale.
-Pale?
Oh, my God.
I gotta meet Anna's parents today.
Hello?
Hi, honey.
Yes, I told him.
I'll get it.
Whenever.
Okay.
Okay, I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.
It's not ready yet.
-Not ready?
It has to be ready.
What kind of a business are you running here?
Who the hell are you?
It's not your quilt.
He's a good friend of mine.
He's like an older brother to me.
When things don't go right, he takes it personally.
-Maybe tomorrow.
-Maybe.
It's okay.
It'll be okay.
-I'll see you later.
-Where you going?
I gotta meet Anna's parents, remember?
I look terrible.
I'm gonna hit the tanning machines.
I can't believe you still do that.
It's bad for you.
That's how I maintain my glow.
-I'm going home.
-Yeah.
-Excuse me.
-Yeah?
How much would it cost to clean this?
-Oh, about $ 1 3.
-Thirteen?
Well, I can't afford that.
Well, I'm sorry.
-Hi, Greg.
-Hey, Elaine.
I'll be off in a second.
Okay.
I got the machine next, buddy.
It's all yours.
What happened?
Did he bring it up?
Never mind that.
Look at the signal I just got.
Signal?
What signal?
He knew I'd use it next.
He didn't wipe his sweat off.
That's a gesture of intimacy.
I'll tell you what that is.
That's a violation of club rules.
-Now I got him.
You're my witness.
-Wait a second, George.
Listen.
He knew what he was doing.
This was a signal.
-A guy leaves sweat, that's a signal?
-Yes.
It's a social thing.
If he left a used Kleenex, what's that, a valentine?
You tell him if he's thinking of turning me in -that I got the goods on him.
-No.
I won't be a party to this.
So you're gonna let me get suspended for shower urination?
Okay, I'll talk to him but you're putting me in very a difficult position.
-I can't let you do this.
-I want to.
-But it isn't right.
I can't.
-Give me the clothes.
Jerry, please.
-What about her?
-Oh, the hell with her.
I can't.
No, Jerry, please.
I'm not gonna let you walk out of my life.
I can't fight you.
Do you want box or hanger?
You decide.
You're really working up quite a sweat today.
Yeah.
Oh, there's the manager.
Good.
I think I'm gonna talk to her about that guy.
We can't have people like that here.
-Are you sure you wanna do that?
-Yeah.
He's disgusting.
Besides, I'll take any chance I can to talk to her.
-You're interested in her?
-Very.
You know, I'm engaged.
Yep, I'm getting married in 50 years.
Oh, good, there he is.
I wanna be able to point him out.
You know, Greg, I wouldn't do that if I were you.
-Why?
-Well, correct me if I'm wrong but isn't it a violation of club policy to not wipe down a machine after using it?
Oh, I see.
You're friends with the urinator, aren't you?
Yeah, well at least he had a drain.
There you go, Mrs. Seinfeld.
With your 25 percent discount, it comes to $ 1 7.80.
Here you go.
Excuse me, this isn't mine.
Oh, yes, it is.
Your husband brought it in himself.
Really?
Thank you.
That's him.
Hi.
You son of a bitch.
-I'm sorry.
-Who is she?
-I want to know who she is.
-It doesn't matter.
I want a divorce.
A divorce?
So you can marry her and give her the discount?
Yes, that's right.
-What happened to us, Jerry?
-I'll tell you what happened.
We got married.
I'm sorry.
This is my fault.
I pushed it on you.
No.
I guess I just wasn't ready for the responsibilities of a pretend marriage.
Goodbye, Jerry.
I forgot.
This is your maple syrup.
It's all right, I want you to have it.
Okay, thanks.
We'll always have pancakes.
Goodbye, Jerry.
I thought you said you was bringing a white boy home.
I don't see a white boy.
I see a damn fool.
To me, the thing about marriage is I can't believe how often it happens.
I like the idea of it, but I can't believe that many people are meeting people that they want to see every single day every day, every day, every day, every day.
That should happen, like, three or four times you know, in the whole century.
Like any major investment, you sign a marriage contract.
Here's your person.
If you're a man, the bride's family pays for the wedding, like getting cash back.
"Till death do us part" that's the extended warranty program.
You give her the ring, that's the keys.
You slide it on, start him up, but you've got to make it work.
Your value drops 20 percent when you drive each other off the lot.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
As humans, we need training in social skills conversational distance.
Don't you hate these people that talk into your mouth like you're a clown at a drive-through?
And handshakes is the worst.
There's absolutely no guidelines for handshakes.
You know how many people--?
Too strong, too weak.
Sometimes they give you the three-quarter handshake, just the fingers.
Early release, late release.
Sometimes people will dispute your release.
You've let go.
They're hanging on.
I have actually said to people, "Hey, the handshake is over".
Too many pumps, coming in too high too sweaty, from too far away.
Sometimes a guy will give you a strong grip, late release and pull you in for the too-close conversation.
To him I say, "That's three strikes.
You're out".
You know, the timing couldn't be worse.
Is there a good time to have your parents stay with you?
I haven't been together with Rachel for three weeks.
First I was on the road, then my parents show up.
I'm getting a little backed up.
-When are they leaving for Paris?
-Not for three days.
-What about her place?
-She lives with her parents.
Really?
Maybe this will become, like, a cool thing, living with your parents.
Then maybe baldness will catch on.
Things will all be turning your way.
Hey, believe me, baldness will catch on.
When the aliens come, who do you think they're gonna relate to?
Who do you think's gonna be getting tour of the ship?
The baldies.
My parents want your parents over for dinner.
Good.
I get the apartment for at least one night.
I'm paying for this Paris trip.
It's their anniversary present.
-Hey, guys.
-Hey, Alec.
-Hey, Alec.
-This is Joey.
-Hey, Joey, how are you doing?
-Hey, listen I was wondering if you'd be interested in doing some work for the Big Brother program.
I'm kind of running the local chapter.
What do you say, George?
-Well.
-Wouldn't you like to be a Big Brother to someone like me?
Please?
Well sure, Joey, sure.
I would be thrilled.
That's great.
Thanks.
I'll get in touch with you.
Wouldn't you like to be a Big Brother--?
All right, Joey.
That's enough.
Let's go.
See you.
-What happened?
-What could I do?
Did you see the mug on that kid?
Wouldn't you like to pass the ketchup to someone like me?
Please?
Have you noticed they moved where they do the interview on Jeopardy?
Yeah.
It was in the middle of Single Jeopardy.
-Now it's after Single Jeopardy.
-Yeah.
It's much better, isn't it?
Oh, no comparison.
I gotta get my parents one of those French-English dictionaries.
-Hey, hey, hey.
-What?
Your parents are going to Paris, right?
-Yeah.
-So I tell Alec that I have to go to Paris for an undetermined amount of time.
Then all I have to do is buy postcards and have your parents mail them from Paris.
-What about little Joey?
-Who?
-He's probably better off.
-Yeah.
I'm trying to get out of this Big Brother program.
When you get to Paris, drop them in any mailbox.
-But there are no stamps on these.
-You gotta buy French stamps.
I'll reimburse you, of course.
Why are you doing this?
He wants this guy to think he's in Paris.
-Why?
-Because George is a deeply disturbed individual.
Oh, hey, Helen.
Could I use some more of your hand lotion?
I told you it was good.
It's from the Saks Fifth Avenue in Miami.
I'll remember that if I'm ever in Florida.
Yeah, or if ever on Fifth Avenue here in New York City.
-You can get some there.
-Yeah?
Say, those are nice pants.
I got a pair just like them at home.
That doesn't surprise me.
I bought these at Rudy's.
It's a used clothing store.
See, when people like you die the widows, they bring in their wardrobes.
-They make a bundle.
-Really?
My father's got a ton of old clothes just sitting up in the attic.
-You think they're worth something?
-lf they're vintage.
And you're a widow.
What happens if the husband dies after the wife?
-Who brings the clothing in then?
-I suppose the children do.
Yes, I suppose they do.
All right.
I got a 1 0:00.
I'll see everybody later.
Hey, I just remembered my parents wanna have you over for dinner before you leave.
-What about tonight?
-Tonight?
Yeah.
They're making paella.
I don't think we can make it tonight.
We have plans.
-What plans?
-We have plans.
-Where did you get plans?
-We have plans.
-Well, what about tomorrow night?
-Maybe.
Okay -I guess I'll tell them that.
-Okay.
-Hey, give them our best, though.
-Yeah.
-I'll call you later.
-Yeah.
-So, what plans do you have?
-None.
So how come you're not going over there for dinner?
Jerry, we don't care much for the Costanzas.
We can't stand them.
-Really?
Since when?
-Since always.
-We've never liked them.
-Why?
Well, they're so loud.
They're always fighting.
It's uncomfortable.
You never noticed?
I noticed.
But they're from your age group.
I didn't think you could detect abnormal behavior among your own kind.
Well, we do.
-Yeah?
-It's us.
Oh, come on up.
-It's Elaine.
You have any problem?
-We adore Elaine.
-She's with her new boyfriend.
-What's he like?
-He's nice.
A bit of a close talker.
-A what?
You'll see.
I really had no idea that you felt this way about the Costanzas.
They're exhausting.
It's like being in an asylum.
-Hi.
-Hi.
-There she is.
-Hello, Elaine.
Hi, Mrs. Seinfeld.
Oh, this is Aaron.
-Hello, Aaron.
-Hello.
How long are you folks in town?
Three more days.
Three more days, and then we're off to Paris.
We're going with a select charter group.
I love France.
I was just there last year.
In fact you know, I still have an envelope full of French francs.
I'll give them to you.
We can't take money.
No.
It's a gift.
From us.
Oh, that is so nice, Aaron.
Isn't he nice?
Has Jerry been showing you a good time?
No, I haven't.
You know, I have a friend who works at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
How'd you like a behind-the-scenes tour?
-Really?
You could do that?
-Easily.
-It wouldn't be any trouble?
-Of course not.
-When could we go?
-How about right now?
-I'm ready.
-Are you sure?
-Yes!
-Okay, let me get my coat.
Elaine, what do you say?
Well, I don't think so, Aaron.
I have plans.
How about you, Jerry?
I'm swamped.
You sure?
You can examine the artwork up close.
Maybe I'll try and catch up with you.
Yeah, that will happen.
All right.
We're off.
-Okay.
Bye.
-Let's go.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
Have a good time.
-Bye.
-See everybody later.
-Okay.
-Bye.
Why would he ask your parents to go to a museum?
-I don't know.
-What is that?
Maybe he was just trying to be nice.
Have you ever heard of anyone doing anything like this?
Wait a second.
He just did me a big favor.
-What?
-He got them out of the house.
-What?
-I can call Rachel.
Oh, no.
I got the machine.
Rachel are you there?
I got the place to myself for a few hours.
Rachel, where are you?
Rachel!
Sorry, pal.
Wish I could help you out.
-They're not coming?
-No.
They had plans.
How could they have plans?
What difference does it make?
They wouldn't lie to us.
-They're our dear friends.
-What am I supposed to do -with all this paella?
-They said tomorrow, maybe.
-Maybe?
-Maybe they don't like us.
Why wouldn't they like us?
Again with the pepper?
What do you gotta use all that pepper for?
-Keep quiet.
-You trying to set my mouth on fire?
I don't know what the reason could be.
-Hello.
-Oh, hi.
What a day.
Jerry, you would not believe the time we had.
Aaron is quite the tour guide.
Have you ever seen those Impressionist paintings?
-Oh, sure, like Monet.
-Don't you think he had to be nearsighted?
Nobody would paint like that if they could see.
It's all out of focus.
He's from the Impressionist school, you know like Monet, Manet, Tippy-tippy-day-day.
I say that guy was painting without his glasses.
Hello.
Rachel.
Yeah.
No.
They're back.
Jerry if you have something to do, we can just sit right here and read.
Yes.
Well I'm sorry too.
Listen, I'll call you later.
Okay.
Bye.
Well, I should be going.
Oh, thanks again.
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.
-Hey.
-Oh, you must be Kramer.
I've heard about you.
Hey, you must be Aaron.
I've heard about you.
-Well, see you later.
-Yeah.
-Bye.
-Okay.
So, what are you guys doing for dinner?
-We have no plans.
-Look at that, Helen.
Do you see what he's wearing?
That's the Executive.
-What is the Executive?
-The beltless trench coat.
-My father invented it.
-I sure did.
Raincoats were my business.
The Executive was a classic.
These haven't been made in 20 years.
Why would they?
Nobody bought them then.
-He's wearing one.
-These are a hot item at Rudy's.
You don't say.
You know, I have boxes of those sitting in my garage in Florida.
Get them up here.
You give me 25 percent, I'll take care of everything.
-You got a deal.
-Yeah.
This is like the meeting of Smith and Wesson.
I'll call Jack Klompus.
He's got a key to the garage.
-He can send them overnight delivery.
-You're gonna start shipping boxes?
-We're leaving for Paris in three days.
-He'll send them express.
-You're crazy.
-I'll tell you how crazy I am.
I'm paying for this trip with these coats.
-I'm paying for the trip.
-So much the better.
Anyway, it's kind of a fluke thing but I'll be leaving for Paris in two days.
I will send you a postcard when I get there.
-Paris, huh?
-Yeah.
You know, I feel terrible about Joey, but it's a great business opportunity.
I don't even know how long I'm gonna be away.
Where will you stay?
An apartment complex.
The.
The Eiffel Towers.
Like I said, you'll be getting a postcard in a few days and again, I'm sorry.
George, you have no idea how fantastic this is.
-Fantastic?
-Yeah.
We've been trying to reunite Joey with his father who lives in Paris.
But he's afraid to fly alone.
You know, he's kind of withdrawn but he seems to take to you.
-So it's a perfect solution.
-Gee, what a coincidence.
And you'll send me a postcard.
Helen really seemed to respond to Renoir.
I think she really connected with the way he painted children.
And that Morty.
I'll tell you, that old guy's full of life.
He was convinced Monet was nearsighted.
-I kept telling him-- -Aaron?
Yes?
Let me ask you a question.
How come you asked Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld to go to the museum with you?
Well, they were in from out of town.
I thought they'd enjoy it.
You didn't feel uncomfortable spending the whole day at the museum with two complete strangers who are more than twice your age?
No.
It was fun.
You had fun with Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld?
Yeah.
They bought me a Coke.
How'd you get the idea for the beltless trench coat?
I came home one night, and I tripped over one of Jerry's toys.
So I took out my belt, just to threaten him and I got a glimpse of myself in the mirror.
-How serendipitous.
-So that night, I cut off the loops and the Executive was born.
He also had an idea for a brimless rain hat but that never materialized.
All right, come on.
Let's play.
-Did you call Jack Klompus?
-I haven't been able to reach him.
I'll call him right now.
-Oh, come on.
-Just a second.
Jerry, have you seen Schindler's List?
-No, I haven't seen it yet.
-You have to go.
-I'm going.
-You have to.
Okay.
-Hello, Jack?
-Yeah?
-Jack, it's Morty.
-Who died?
Nobody died.
Jack, I want you to do me a big favor.
-In my garage are a couple of boxes.
-What boxes?
-I'm gonna explain what boxes.
-All right.
How the hell do I know?
Anyway, there are these three big boxes you can't miss them, I want you to ship them here to New York.
I thought you were going to Paris.
I'm still going to Paris.
I got a big deal cooking here.
-What's in the boxes?
-Raincoats.
Raincoats?
You think you're gonna sell those old crappy raincoats?
That's garbage.
I guarantee you, Doris won't let him mail those boxes.
-When do you want these?
-Send them tomorrow.
So you think they're coming tonight?
I don't know.
They said maybe.
Of course they're coming.
They're leaving soon.
-lf they don't come, they won't see us.
-Well, they better come.
I got all this paella.
I admire Morty and Helen going to France.
We should take a trip.
Maybe a cruise.
Yes, a cruise.
A long cruise.
Just the two of you.
Georgie, what were you doing poking around the attic last night?
-I wasn't in the attic.
-I heard noise.
-Maybe it was a mouse.
-Okay, that's it!
We're moving!
-What?
-I will not tolerate infestation.
You haven't even seen one.
Don't you understand?
The very thought, the very idea.
I'll never be comfortable again.
All right, Frank.
That's enough.
I guess I've been hanging onto them for so long because I couldn't accept the fact that Dad was really gone forever.
They will get a good home, won't they?
I gotta be honest, there's nothing here too spectacular.
Oh, I beg to differ.
My father took great pride in his appearance.
He was a very handsome man, a Casanova, really.
I'll give you $200 for the three boxes.
Could you make it 225?
That was his high game in bowling.
Yeah, I'm in a good mood.
Here.
Thank you.
Hey, George.
What are you doing here?
I'm just selling some of Dad's things.
That's what he would have wanted.
Oh, I got you.
-That'll do.
-Hey, guess what.
Morty Seinfeld and I are going into business together, selling raincoats.
-That's swell.
-We worked it out -all over dinner last night.
-Dinner?
-You had dinner with the Seinfelds?
-Yeah, last night.
Was this something you had planned?
No, it was spur of the moment.
Well, you know Morty.
He likes to fly by the seat of his vintage pants.
They had plans, huh?
They had plans!
Boy, I've never seen these before.
They just came in.
Part of my springtime cruise collection.
-Two for $25.
-Oh, I'll take these.
Yeah.
Hey, remember this raincoat that you sold me?
Sure.
That's the Executive.
-Do you have any others?
-I wish.
They don't make it anymore.
Suppose I told you I have 50 in mint condition.
You interested?
-Very interested.
-They're coming in from Florida.
-Bring them in.
-So you'll buy them?
I don't see what would possibly stop me?
They had plans, huh?
They were busy.
They were busy with their big plans, huh?
-What are you talking about?
-Mom and Pop Seinfeld.
-Look, I don't know.
-I know what they did last night.
-They had dinner with Kramer.
-It was a last-minute thing.
They won't have dinner with my parents?
-Right.
-Something wrong with my parents?
-Absolutely.
-My parents are wonderful people.
-These the same people you live with?
-Yes.
-Are they coming tonight or not?
-I don't know what their plans are.
Okay.
Fine.
It's gonna be very interesting very interesting if they don't show up tonight.
You know, my mother made all this paella.
What is that, anyway?
It's a Spanish dish.
It's a mélange of fish and meat with rice.
-Very tasty.
-I'll tell them.
-Could you do one other thing for me?
-Name it.
Would your parents have any objections to taking a little kid to Paris with them?
It turns out that the kid's father lives in Paris.
Is that a coincidence?
You know, Alec wants me to take him over there so I figure as long as they're going-- You thought as long as they're mailing postcards it wouldn't be too much to ask my parents to drag a child who they've never seen through the streets of Paris?
If you think it's too much, they don't have to mail the postcards.
So where's he taking you?
Well, first we're going to a matinee.
I'm taking the afternoon off.
We're gonna go see My Fair Lady.
And then we're gonna go to dinner.
-He knows all these fantastic places.
-You are one lucky girl.
Wish I could find a nice guy.
-Hi, Aaron.
-Hey, Joanne.
-Hey.
-Hi.
-Hello, hello.
-Hello, Elaine.
I was able to finagle two more tickets to My Fair Lady and I thought, why not ask Morty and Helen?
-Great.
-This is some office.
What's the square footage?
-You don't mind, do you, Elaine?
-Mind?
Oh, of course not.
We can make a whole day of it.
This is some building.
Harry Fleming used to have an office here.
There was a deli on the first floor.
You don't get corned beef like that anymore.
What happened to that deli?
I really don't know, Mr. Seinfeld.
We better not.
They're gonna be here any second.
When are they leaving?
In two days.
-It's been so long.
-I know.
Okay.
-It's only two more days.
-Right.
Thursday, 3:00.
-Oh, hi.
-We didn't know you had company.
Yeah.
This is Rachel.
-Hi.
-Hello, Rachel.
-We'll come back another time.
-What other time?
-Whenever.
-Where you going?
-We'll drive around for a while.
-You don't have a car.
-We'll take a bus.
-Come on.
Stop.
-No, we don't mind.
-I'll get a book.
No, it's okay.
I was just leaving anyway.
Are you sure?
Because we don't wanna-- No, it's okay.
-We'll go see Schindler's List, right?
-Definitely.
Okay.
-It was nice meeting you.
-Nice meeting you.
-See you later.
-Bye-bye.
Boy, that was some show.
-What show?
-My Fair Lady.
-When did you get tickets to see that?
-Aaron surprised us, and Elaine came.
Oh, Elaine?
Really?
Well, that sounds interesting.
We saw Regis Philbin get out of a limousine.
He looks better on TV.
-Hello.
-Hello, Jerry.
-Yeah?
-It's Jack Klompus.
Oh, hi, Jack.
So when are you coming down to Florida again?
As soon as is humanly possible.
You know, I still got that pen, the one that writes upside down.
Yeah.
I should have kept it.
-So where's your father?
-Oh, he's right here.
-Yeah?
-Hello, Morty.
Listen, I can't get in the garage.
-What do you mean?
-There is something wrong with the key.
The key doesn't work.
-You gotta jiggle it a little bit.
-I jiggled it.
I jiggled it for 1 5 minutes.
Tell him to come down here and get his own packages.
You have nothing better to do than worry about his boxes?
You gotta pull on the knob as you turn it.
Get the hell out of here with your knob!
What does he want from you?
My idiot son could open that garage door.
What did I do?
Just do it first thing tomorrow.
I need it.
They'll be here first thing Thursday morning.
Thursday morning?
You know we're leaving at 3:00.
Yeah, you're leaving at 3:00.
-How will you get this done?
-Don't worry about it.
Yeah, how you gonna get all this done in time?
They were drinking champagne in a buggy!
-First Kramer, then Elaine?
-Yeah.
-It's a slap in the face.
-What did we ever do to them?
I wanna know what we did to them.
What are they, too good for us?
A raincoat salesman.
-I could buy and sell him, like that.
-The hell with them!
The thing that bothers me the most is the lying.
Well, let's forget about it.
We're going on a beautiful vacation.
Vacation?
Your mother and I are planning on taking a cruise.
But I can't find any of my vacation clothes.
They were in the attic.
The attic?
You haven't worn any of those clothes for years.
How can I go on a cruise without my cabana-wear?
I love those clothes.
A mouse!
I saw a mouse!
It's the remote.
Where the hell are my clothes?
I love those clothes.
Lousy, moth-ridden crap.
I'm not crazy about used clothes.
I mean, they call it vintage you know, to take your mind off what it really is, nasty-wear.
Oh, it's clean, you know.
People wear underwear.
Yeah, well, they don't wear iron underwear.
And that's what it's gonna take to get me in those clothes.
I'll move into an apartment after a strange person moves out.
Why would I wanna move into somebody's pants?
There is no vintage underwear, of course.
But it's not because a guy couldn't sell his underwear.
It's because men wear their underwear until it absolutely disintegrates.
Men hang onto underwear until each individual underwear molecule is so strained it can barely retain the properties of a solid.
It actually becomes underwear vapor.
We don't even throw it out.
We just open a window and it goes out like dandelion spores.
That's how men throw out underwear.
We go-- Then it's gone.
That's it.
It's just.
-Hey, Jerry.
-So how was the movie?
Oh, really good.
Really good.
-Didn't three hours go by like that?
-Like that.
What about the end, with the list?
Yeah, that was some list.
What'd you think of the black and white?
The black and white?
The whole movie was in black and white.
Oh, yeah, I didn't even realize.
You don't think about it.
There's so much going on.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I tell you, I could see it again.
So Klompus has the key, but the jerk couldn't open it up.
All you gotta do is jiggle it.
You just get it in there, jiggle it, jiggle it.
Look, I find this whole thing very uninteresting.
-When you get the coats, come in.
-Oh, yeah.
Hey, I'm on your side.
Hey.
What, again?
I'm trying to buy some of the clothes back.
Hey, wanna come over for dinner tonight?
My mother made all this extra paella.
Paella?
Yeah, I'll be there.
Apparently, the Seinfelds are too good for us.
I shouldn't say anything bad about your partner.
No, no.
We're not really partners.
I only get 25 percent.
Twenty-five percent?
It was your idea.
-Yeah, I know.
-You're doing all the legwork.
-That's right.
-He's ripping you off.
-You're right.
He's ripping me off.
-You should be getting more.
-He's ripping me off.
-Don't let him take advantage of you.
Oh, it's you.
You're the one who sold me the moth-ridden cabana crap.
You know, I've been thinking why is Kramer getting 25 percent?
Well, he told you about the place.
So what?
Why is that worth 25 percent?
It's a finder's fee.
You know what a finder's fee is?
You find something, you get a fee.
A finder's fee is 1 0 percent, no more.
Well, it's too late now.
Those are my coats.
I saved them, I stored them.
I've been waiting years for this payoff.
Well, you're not gonna say anything.
Hey.
-I've been thinking about something.
-Yeah, so have l-- -I don't think the deal is fair.
-You don't think it's fair?
No, no.
I found the place.
I set the whole thing up.
-I'm doing all the legwork.
-What legwork?
-There's legwork.
-lf anything, you're getting too much.
-Too much?
-That's right.
They're my coats.
Okay, look, I want 35 percent.
I'm thinking more like 1 5.
-No way I'm taking 1 5.
-Well, you're not getting 35!
All right, let's compromise.
-Twenty-five percent.
-Okay, it's a deal.
Moths are the scourge of my business.
All it takes is one moth to lay eggs.
Know what happens to the larvae?
They hatch everywhere.
Well, I'm sorry.
Here's your money back.
And I'll take the clothes.
This will hardly put a dent in my fumigation bill.
-So where are the clothes?
-I burned them.
That's good.
Now, I know they're your parents, Jerry and they're very nice people.
But don't you think it's odd that a 35-year-old man is going to these lengths to see that someone else's parents are enjoying themselves?
I mean, don't you find that abnormal?
It is a tad askew.
I mean, they're your parents, and you don't do anything.
Why's this stranger doing it?
I've hardly been out with them.
See?
See?
And I can't even say anything you know, because all he's really doing is being nice but nobody's this nice.
This is, like -certifiably nice.
-You're right.
He's insane.
Yes, he's insane.
That's what I think.
-So, what are you gonna do?
-I don't know.
I don't know what to do.
Oh, God.
So how was the movie?
From what I saw, it was pretty good.
What do you mean, "from what you saw"?
Well, I didn't actually get to see the whole movie.
Yeah, why not?
I was kind of making out.
You were making out during Schindler's List?
I couldn't help it.
We hadn't been alone in a long time.
It got the better of me.
-During Schindler's List?
-We're both living with our parents.
Did anybody see you or say anything?
Oh, I don't think so.
I saw Newman, but he didn't see me.
Hello, Mrs. Seinfeld.
Hello, Newman.
Jerry's not here.
Having a nice trip?
Wonderful.
We went to the theater last night.
Oh, the theater.
-Because I was wondering-- -Wondering what?
Why I didn't see you at Schindler's List with Jerry.
Well, we already saw it.
Oh, well, it's a good thing for Jerry that you didn't go.
-Why is that?
-Well, he really seemed to have his hands full, if you know what I mean?
I'm afraid I don't.
Him and his buxom little friend, Rachel were going at it pretty good in the balcony.
-What?
-Do I have to spell it out for you?
He was moving on her like the stormtroopers into Poland.
Jerry was necking during Schindler's List?
Yes.
And a more offensive spectacle I cannot recall.
Anyway, I just really came up to get some detergent.
-Jerry sends his laundry out.
-Oh, right.
Well, it was nice seeing you folks.
Oh, by the way you didn't hear this from me.
Ta-ta.
Hi.
-What?
What did I do?
-How could you?
-How could I what?
-You were making out during Schindler's List?
What?
-No.
-Don't lie, Jerry.
Newman.
-How could you do such a thing?
-I couldn't help it.
We hadn't been alone together in a long time.
We started up a little during the coming attractions and the next thing we knew the war was over.
-Hello.
-Jerry.
-It's Jack Klompus.
-Hang on a second.
Dad, it's Klompus.
-Hello.
-Hello, Morty?
Listen.
That key doesn't work.
-It's no good.
-You didn't get in?
Oh, I got in.
I had to break the window with a rock.
And then I got my hand all cut up reaching in.
-You broke the window?
-He broke the window?
You wanted those damn boxes, didn't you?
He should be on his hands and knees thanking you.
-Did you send them?
-Yeah.
They'll be there tomorrow afternoon, 2:00.
Tomorrow afternoon?
-Tomorrow afternoon?
-Tomorrow afternoon?
I told you to send them express.
It was $ 1 0 cheaper in the afternoon than the morning.
I figured, what the hell's the difference?
-What did you do about the window?
-I gotta fix your window now?
All right, all right.
Goodbye.
I don't think we'll make that flight.
What do you mean you won't make it?
We have to make the flight.
We're with a charter group.
If we don't, the trip is off.
What's the difference?
We'll go someplace else.
Someplace else?
What about Paris?
You don't understand.
I've come this far.
I can't stop now.
I can't believe that you're doing all this just to sell some stupid raincoats.
You don't understand.
Fashion is cyclical.
This thing could come back.
I think you're out of your mind.
I just don't understand how all those clothes can disappear.
-Moths?
-Moths ate three boxes?
Well, you know what happens when larvae hatch.
They're everywhere.
You know, I was thinking today.
I never liked those Seinfelds anyway.
He's an idiot altogether.
-Oh, there's Kramer.
-Hello!
Hello!
Hey.
-Good evening.
-Hope you're hungry.
Paella.
-Here, let me take your coat.
-Oh, yeah.
Thanks, buddy.
-Hey.
-That shirt.
-Where did you get that shirt?
-What?
That's my cabana shirt.
You stole my shirt, you son of a bitch!
George, your friends up in the attic, stealing my clothes!
Give me that back.
Give me that.
Give me.
I bought it from Rudy.
Rudy!
That skunk!
-I knew he didn't burn those clothes!
-Who's Rudy?
-What clothes?
-I sold your clothes yesterday.
You sold my clothes?
What do you mean, you sold my clothes?
-I didn't think you wore them anymore.
-It's cruise-wear!
Kramer.
-I love that shirt.
-Oh, yeah.
That's because it's mine!
You look just like Frank on our honeymoon.
Well, thank you.
-Who's this Rudy?
-Rudy's the guy buying Morty's raincoats.
Morty Seinfeld?
He's a bum.
The whole deal's going down tomorrow.
-Morty's gonna miss his plane for it.
-Missing his plane?
-Wasn't that a charter flight?
-Yeah.
What happens to charter tickets when you don't use them?
Well, I suppose they're wasted.
Yes, I suppose they are.
Tomorrow I'm going straight down to this Rudy and get my clothes.
-A mouse!
-Egad!
A mouse!
In the bedroom!
-You want the tickets?
-Yes.
You're gonna take this kid to Paris?
I get a free trip to Paris.
I go in the Big Brothers' Hall of Fame.
I mail my own postcards.
-You know I'm paying for these tickets.
-It's all right.
I got lunch.
You should've gone to the Costanzas' for dinner.
The paella was magnificent.
Have you ever had really good paella?
-Not really.
-It's an orgiastic feast for the senses a wanton festival of sights, sounds and colors and.
Dad, you sure we're at the right carousel?
-This is it.
-So how much are we gonna make?
Take it easy.
I've been through a million of these negotiations.
Two thousand?
Three thousand?
That's giving it away.
This is a one-of-a-kind item.
-More?
More than 3000?
-Just watch me do my thing.
-Say, Dad, isn't that one of yours?
-Look at this.
Look how this idiot packed it.
He didn't tape it.
He just flipped the flaps.
Wait.
Hold it.
Kramer, you missed a couple.
Bonjour, welcome to the Gateway to Paris charter flight.
Dad, isn't that your charter group?
Honesty.
Hard work.
These are the values that I was raised with.
The most important thing, Joey is to be able to look yourself in the mirror before you sleep.
Hey, I got news for you, four-eyes there's no way you're staying with us in Paris.
You burned them?
Those clothes are not yours to burn.
-Who are you, anyways?
-I'm the father.
-He said his father was dead.
-He said I was dead?
That's right.
Squeezed an extra $25 out of me.
That's what my life is worth to him, $25?
-Hey, Frank!
-Oh, hey.
I want you to know that I'm retracting our dinner invitation.
You don't have to retract it.
We never went.
I'm retracting that it was ever offered.
I retract your retraction.
What are you, trying to unload some junk of yours?
Will you excuse me, please?
We're conducting business here.
Keep them.
I'm not interested.
-I thought we had a deal?
-That's another one of my shirts!
Not buying any more clothes from anyone off the street.
The street?
I'm in the raincoat business 35 years.
-Maybe they have moths, like his stuff.
-My clothes don't have moths!
Because of his moths, you're not buying my raincoats?
-That's right.
-I'm all ticklish.
Flight 433 now boarding for Miami at gate 1 8-A.
-Flight 433 now boarding.
-Okay.
Let's go.
It was so nice of you to come to the airport to see us off.
Are you sure you can't stay a little longer?
-No!
-No!
-Goodbye.
-Bye-bye.
-Take care.
-Okay, Jer.
-Bye-bye, Elaine.
-Bye-bye.
We'll call you when we get home.
Thank you.
I think she meant me, but.
Make sure Kramer uses good tape to send back the raincoats.
-Okay.
-Bye.
-Bye.
-Aaron?
Aaron, are you okay?
I could've done more.
I could've done so much more.
-You did enough.
-No.
I could've called the travel agency got them on another flight to Paris.
-I could've got them out!
-You tried, Aaron.
-It was too expensive.
-This watch.
This watch could've paid for their whole trip.
This ring.
This ring is one more dinner I could've taken them out to.
Water.
-They need some water.
-Why?
They'll get dehydrated on the plane!
Get the Seinfelds some water!
Please!
Please!
Hi, Mr. Goldstein.
Is Rachel home?
I'm afraid Rachel is not going to see you tonight or any other night for that matter.
-Why?
What did I do?
-You know very well.
I heard about your behavior at the movies the other night.
It was disgraceful.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
I will not allow my daughter to be involved with someone of such weak moral fiber.
Fortunately, my postman happened to witness the entire incident.
A heavyset fellow.
I believe he lives in your building.
-Now, if you don't mind.
-Rachel.
-Rachel.
-Good night.
So my parents get home, they open the door my father flicks the light on, and the whole place is cleaned out.
-Everything.
-Get out.
-How did that happen?
-The broken window.
Klompus never fixed it.
They just walked right in.
Boy, they could use a vacation.
They're taking one.
The travel agent's trying to set something up for them.
So how about that Aaron?
You know what drove me crazy about him?
Did you ever notice he stood too close to you when he talked?
No, I hadn't noticed.
Pair of bear claws, please.
-Hi, Newman.
-Hello, Jerry.
I happened to catch you coming out of Schindler's List the other night.
Oh, were you there?
Yes, I was.
-It's a powerful film.
-Yeah.
-Shocking brutality, don't you think?
-Shocking.
-Yeah, well, that was nothing.
-Jerry!
Jerry!
Where the hell is your father?
This is the best thing we ever did.
I hope those exterminators know what they're doing.
Forget about them.
Let's just try and relax.
Personal distance is a very important thing.
There's a new personal distance, ATM distance.
When someone's using an ATM, you wanna be about 6 feet back.
Don't you?
Because people get edgy around that ATM, don't they?
They got their money out, their eyes are darting all around.
The other place I wanna be You want some distance there too.
ATMs and urinals.
I guess whenever someone's taking valuables out of their pants, you wanna give them as much room as possible.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 20}
The thing about birthday parties is that the first and last party you have are quite similar.
You just kind of sit there.
You're the least excited person at the party.
You don't even realize that there is a party.
You don't know what's going on.
Both birthday parties, people have to help you blow out the candles.
You don't even know why you're doing it.
What is this ritual?
What is going on?
It's also the only two birthday parties where other people have to gather your friends together for you.
Sometimes they're not your friends.
They make the judgment.
They bring them in, and they tell you, "These are your friends.
Tell them, 'Thank you for coming to my birthday party".
' These are great.
Just great.
Really great.
Really, really great.
Don't you think so, Elaine?
Yeah.
Really great.
A coffee table book about coffee tables.
How did you come up with this idea?
It was there.
Look at this one.
It's saying, "I'm a coffee table.
Put some coffee on me.
The hotter the better.
That's what I'm here for".
You know, actually, I've got some work I've got to do.
How about if the book came with these little foldout legs so the book itself becomes a coffee table?
That is a great idea.
Really, really great.
And that coffee table is saying, "Put some coffee on me".
I'd like to put some coffee on her.
Hot, scalding coffee right in her face.
I swear, this is like working with a contestant from The Price Is Right.
Yeah, that's real interesting.
Listen, tell me if you think this is funny.
"Men definitely hit the remote more than women.
Men don't care what's on TV.
Men only care what else is on TV.
Women wanna see what the show is before they change the channel because men hunt and women nest".
Yeah, it's funny.
I don't know.
You don't know?
Come on, that's gold.
-Well, I don't know about gold.
-Oh, that's gold, baby.
-"Baby"?
Are you doing George now?
-I was saying "baby" before George.
Don't ask me any more questions about jokes.
It puts pressure on me.
Leonard Christian's gonna be there.
Yeah?
Who's he?
A writer from Entertainment Weekly.
I would like to have a good show.
-Danke schön, my little dumplings.
-Hi.
-Hey, how about that Toby?
-Yeah, how about her?
She's a package full of energy.
-She's a package full of something.
-And that something is life.
You got to meet her.
She's brimming with positivity.
-Oh, please.
-Hey.
-Are you performing tomorrow?
-Yeah.
Great.
I'm gonna bring Toby.
You better laugh.
I'm being reviewed.
-Leonard Christian's gonna be there.
-She's a great laugher.
Yeah.
She's a great laugher, Jerry.
"Really, really great".
Want to sit with George?
He's coming with Robin.
-Is that the waitress from the club?
-Yeah.
-Is she bringing her kid too?
-She's got a kid?
You should see George get along with this kid.
What are you doing under there?
Stop that.
Don't eat that.
That's not food.
-He's sucking down Equal packets.
-Do you think 25 kids is too much?
Twenty-five kids for his birthday party?
Don't put your tongue on the floor.
He's putting his tongue on the floor.
Here, here.
Have some more sugar packets.
So, what about entertainment?
-Should I get Barney?
-No Barney.
-Maybe a clown.
-How about Bozo?
Who's Bozo?
Who's Bozo?
Bozo the Clown.
That's who Bozo is.
When I was a kid, Bozo the Clown was the clown, bar none.
-George.
-With the orange hair -the big clown shirt with the ruffles.
-George.
-A TV show, he had cartoons.
-George!
Forget Bozo, George.
Bozo's out.
He's finished.
It's over for Bozo.
When I was a kid, we didn't have these parties with catered food and entertainment.
I remember my seventh birthday party.
Blow out the candles!
Blow out the candles!
I said blow out the damn candles!
-Stop it, Frank!
You're killing him!
-Blow out the candles!
Well, this time, you can blow out the candles.
No, I have asthma.
Ben.
Ben!
Hi.
-Hi, Toby.
-How are you doing today?
Fine.
-How are you?
-Oh, I'm great.
Just great.
Really great.
-Hey, did you hear about Bob Rosen?
-No.
He's going to Knopf.
He's going to be a vice president.
Knopf?
Really?
Boy, that means there's an opening here for senior editor.
Has Lippman hired anyone?
No.
I hear he wants to promote someone in-house.
-Really?
-Maybe it'll be you.
-Well-- -You really deserve it.
-Well-- -I mean, you have experience seniority, Lippman really respects your opinion.
Well.
-Hey, it could be you.
-No.
-No, really.
-Really?
You think so?
-Sure.
-Boy, wouldn't that be exciting?
-Stranger things have happened.
-Me, a senior editor.
I'd like that.
You shouldn't get your hopes up.
Well, it's a possibility.
Like you said stranger things have happened.
Thank you, Elaine.
Thank you.
-Hey, Ronnie.
-Hey.
Can I have a club soda?
-Going on tonight?
-Yeah.
-You?
-Yeah.
-You know, Leonard Christian's here.
-I know.
Can I ask you something?
Are my nostrils getting bigger?
-I don't think so.
-Are you sure?
Take a look.
Do they seem a little bigger?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Is it possible for nostrils to expand?
-Is this a bit?
-Hey, I don't do bits.
I'm a prop comic.
Damn it.
I can't find my water gun.
I can't go on without my water gun.
-Hey, Jerry.
-Hey.
-Well, here's Toby.
Jerry.
-This is so exciting.
Look.
I have goose bumps.
Touch.
Touch them.
-Hey.
-I've never been -to a comedy club before.
-Really?
Many restaurants are serving brewed decaf now too.
-You are so funny.
-You'll have a good time, I swear.
He swears, like he thinks I don't believe him.
I believe you.
-He's so funny.
-What about me?
What about you?
I'm only kidding.
You're funny too.
I love to laugh.
-Good.
-So you up next?
Yeah.
Why don't you guys get a good table.
We don't want some jerk sitting in front of us.
It'll be like, "Hey, big-head, can you move?
I didn't pay a cover charge to stare at your bald spot".
-So you have a good show.
-Yeah.
Have a great show.
Hey, we'll make sure it's a great show.
-Okay.
Good.
I'll see you later.
-Yeah.
He's so great.
This is so great.
I'm so excited.
Men definitely hit the remote button more than women.
-Really, really.
That is so true.
-Yes, l-- Yeah.
Men don't care what's on TV.
Men only care what else is on TV.
Yes.
Right on, right on.
See, women-- Women wanna see what the show is before they change the channel.
That is so true.
Yes, yes.
That's why men hunt and women nest.
Yeah, anyway-- Yeah, all right.
So anyway.
What was I talking about?
-Hey.
-Hey.
What's the deal?
I invite you down here, I have an important show -and she heckles me?
-She didn't mean anything.
-What's the matter?
Is she crazy?
-She's just enthusiastic, that's all.
-Hey, what is wrong with you?
-Me?
-Nothing's wrong with me.
-You boo me?
You hiss?
You didn't stop blathering throughout the whole set.
Come on.
I thought you're a pro.
That's part of the show.
No.
Not part of the show.
Booing and hissing are not part of the show.
You boo puppets.
You hiss villains in silent movies.
That's the way I express myself.
How will you make it if you can't take it?
-I can take it.
-Let's go.
Hey, man, good set.
-Bozo?
-No.
-B-O-Z-O.
-Sorry.
l-- You've never heard of Bozo the Clown?
No.
-How could you not know?
-I don't know.
I just don't.
How can you call yourself a clown and not know who Bozo is?
Hey, what are you hassling me for?
This is just a gig.
It's not my life.
I don't know who Bozo is.
Is he a clown?
What, are you kidding me?
-Well, what is he?
-Yes, he's a clown.
All right.
So, what's the big deal?
There's millions of clowns.
-All right, just forget it.
- Forget--?
Me?
You should forget it.
You're living in the past, man.
You're hung up on some clown -from the '60s, man.
-All right.
Very good, very good.
All right, go fold your balloon animals, Eric.
Eric.
What kind of name is that for a clown, huh?
Excuse me.
You must be George.
I'm Robin's mother.
You seem like -such a lovely young man.
-Well, I do what I can.
Hi, Ma.
How's everything?
This is just a wonderful party.
The burgers should be ready in a minute.
Great, great.
What's that smell?
Smoke?
Smoke.
Everybody, I think I smell some smoke back here.
Fire!
Get out of here!
Get out of my way!
-It was an inferno in there!
-There he is.
That's him!
-That's the coward that left us to die.
-Let go.
I was trying to lead the way.
We needed a leader, someone to lead the way to safety.
But you yelled, "Get out of my way".
Because.
Because as the leader, if I die then all hope is lost.
Who would lead?
The clown?
Instead of castigating me, you should be thanking me.
What kind of topsy-turvy world do we live in where heroes are cast as villains, brave men as cowards?
But I saw you push the women and children out of the way in a mad panic.
I saw you knock them down.
And when you ran out, you left everyone behind.
Seemingly.
Seemingly.
To the untrained eye I can fully understand how you got that impression.
What looked like pushing, what looked like knocking down was a safety precaution.
In a fire you stay close to the ground.
Am I right?
Well-- And when I ran out that door, I was not leaving anyone behind.
Quite the contrary.
I risked my life making sure that exit was clear.
Any other questions?
How do you live with yourself?
It's not easy.
So she doesn't want to see me anymore.
Did you knock her over too or just the kids?
No, her too.
And her mother.
-Really?
Her mother?
-Yeah.
I may have stepped on her arm too.
You probably couldn't see because of the smoke.
Yeah.
But it was somebody's arm.
So you feel "women and children first" in this day and age is somewhat of an antiquated notion.
To some degree, yeah.
So basically, it's every man, woman, child and invalid for themselves.
-In a manner of speaking.
-Yeah.
-Well, it's honest.
-Yeah.
She should be commending me for treating everyone like equals.
Perhaps when she's released from the burn center she'll see things differently.
Perhaps.
So, what was the fire, just some greasy hamburgers?
Yeah.
Eric the clown put it out with his big shoe.
-By the way, did you see this?
-What's that?
The Leonard Christian article about my show.
Plus my gig in Miami got canceled.
I bet you it's because of the article.
He really does a number on you.
"Seinfeld froze like a deer in the headlights in the face of incessant heckling".
I should've let her have it.
I held back because of Kramer.
Know what you should do?
-Go to her office and heckle her.
-Right.
All the comedians say, "What if I came to your work and heckled you"?
-Yeah, that'd be something.
-I'm not kidding.
You should do it.
Wouldn't that be the ultimate comedian's revenge?
-I've always had a fantasy about that.
-Well, go ahead.
Do it.
-Why can't I?
-No reason.
You know what?
I think I'm gonna do that.
She came down to where I work.
I'll go down to where she works.
-This is unprecedented.
-There's no precedent, baby.
What, you're using my "babies" now?
Hey, nice shoes.
Do you wear sandals to work?
It's nice to walk into a room and get the aroma of feet.
Real conducive to the work atmosphere.
I'm sure your coworkers like it.
"Hey, let's go eat in Toby's office".
"Great idea.
We can check on her bunions".
You know, I have work to do here.
I'm very busy.
Is this disruptive?
You find it hard to work with someone interrupting?
-How'd you like it if I called security?
-Security?
I don't know how you'll make it in this business if you can't take it.
You got to be tough.
You know-- All right.
That's it.
-Get out of my way.
-What's going on?
What's happening here?
Toby.
Toby!
-My pinkie toe.
-Toby!
What did you go out there to heckle her for?
Because she came down the club and heckled me.
I gave her a taste of her own medicine.
Oh, yeah!
You gave her a taste of medicine, all right.
-I didn't want her to have an accident.
-What accident?
After he heckled Toby, she ran out of the building and a street sweeper ran over her foot and severed her pinkie toe.
-That's unbelievable.
-Yeah.
Then after the ambulance left I found the toe.
I put it in a Cracker Jack box with ice and took off for the hospital.
-You ran?
-No.
I jumped on the bus.
I told the driver, "I got a toe here, buddy.
Step on it".
-Holy cow!
-Yeah, yeah.
Then all of a sudden, this guy pulls out a gun.
Well, I knew any delay's gonna cost her her pinkie toe so I got up, and I started walking towards him.
He says, "Where do you think you're going, Cracker Jack"?
I says, "Well, I got a prize for you, buddy".
-Knocked him out cold.
-How could you do that?
Then everybody is screaming because the driver's passed out because of all the commotion.
The bus is out of control.
So I grab him by the collar, take him out of the seat get behind the wheel.
Now I'm driving the bus.
-You're Batman.
-Yeah.
I am Batman.
Then the mugger, he comes to, and he starts choking me.
So I'm fighting him off with one hand and I kept driving the bus with the other, you know?
Then I managed to open the door and kicked him out the door with my foot, you know, at the next stop.
You kept making all the stops?
Well, people kept ringing the bell!
Well, what about the toe?
What happened to the toe?
Well, I am happy to say the little guy's back in place at the end of the line.
You did all this for a pinkie toe?
Well, it's a valuable appendage.
So Kramer found the toe, and they reattached it.
-Really?
-Yeah.
Poor kid.
-What an ordeal.
-And you know how extremely sensitive she is.
She's gonna need our full support.
-Yeah, right.
-Look who's here.
-Toby.
-Hey, it's Toby.
Hi.
How are you?
How are you feeling?
-I'll be okay.
-Are you sure?
-I think so.
-Toby, what can I do?
-Can I get you something?
-No, thank you.
Toby, please let us help.
We're family.
Well, I could use a cup of coffee.
-She got the promotion?
-Yep.
-Why?
-I'll tell you why.
Because of her pinkie toe, that's why.
Because Lippman felt so sorry for her, he didn't want to hurt her feelings.
-Too bad.
-Sure, the pinkie toe is cute but I mean, what is it?
It's useless.
It does nothing.
It's got that little nail that is just impossible to cut.
-Why do we need it?
-That's the one that goes "wee, wee, wee" all the way home.
-You just shut the-- -Elaine, did you hear the news?
-Toby got promoted.
-Yes, I heard, Kramer.
-I work there, remember?
-You know what she told me?
Her first order of business is to put my coffee table book into the bookstores as soon as possible.
-Oh, wonderful.
-Throughout this whole thing -she always kept smiling.
-Of course.
She's deranged.
I went down to the magazine, pleaded with him to see me again.
He agreed to come down tonight and write another article.
I heard you went down to somebody's office -and heckled them.
-Damn right.
-We've been lap dogs long enough.
-How could you do that?
Everybody's talking about it.
It's about time one of us drew a line in the sand.
Jerry, you're like Rosa Parks.
You opened the door for all of us.
I can't wait until somebody heckles me.
-Well, it won't be long.
-Ladies and gentlemen -please welcome Jerry Seinfeld.
-Got to go.
Robin?
Robin.
-George, what is it?
I'm working.
-Robin, listen to me.
The most amazing thing has happened.
Kramer has opened my eyes.
I think I've changed.
-What are you talking about?
-Okay.
I mean, Bozo the Clown.
I mean, does he really need "the Clown" in his title?
As clown.
Bozo the Clown.
Are we gonna confuse him with Bozo the district attorney?
Bozo the pope?
There's no other Bozo.
You'll see.
Things will be different now if you'll just give me one more chance.
Listen, I got to think about this.
-All right, but I'm serious about this.
-All right.
Hand it over, man.
That's why men hunt and women nest.
He's got a gun!
He's got a gun!
Get out of the way!
-George.
-What?
-This is Ronnie Kaye.
-The prop comic?
Hi.
I didn't-- I didn't recognize you.
What, did you--?
You get a haircut?
Nostrils.
George?
Could I have a word?
I was in a hotel, and the back of a door in the hotel, they have that fire map.
I'm flattered they think I'll stand in a burning hotel room memorizing directions.
I'll go left by the stair, right by the candy machine.
I'd probably get lost, have to go back to the room, check the map again.
They always tell you, whatever you do in a hotel fire, do not panic.
Hey, I've got four minutes to live.
I've never panicked in my life.
It's my option.
Even if they find you, you have a perfect excuse.
They saved you swinging from the shower curtain naked with the ice bucket on your head.
What happened?
Well, I panicked.
That's understandable.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Human fascination with water is amazing.
We're constantly going to beaches, pools, lakes, rivers.
We're swimming, we're snorkeling, we're scuba-diving.
We bathe in it.
Our bodies are mostly made of water.
Everyone's carrying around these bottles of water.
We can't get enough water.
Unless it rains then we're like, "Oh, look, I'm soaked.
I am literally drenched".
For some reason, we have a huge problem with small, flying water.
It'll just stop us right in our tracks.
"I felt a drop.
We're gonna get caught in it!
Everyone cover your water bottles.
Run"!
Get off at the next exit.
Kramer, I've driven to East Hampton many times.
I know the exit.
I hear it's a great house.
Pool, sun deck.
Yeah, I'll be there.
You sure we're making the right move?
We gotta see the new baby.
At least we'll get a weekend in the Hamptons.
-Didn't they just have a baby?
-That was two years ago.
Remember?
"Jerry, you gotta see the baby.
You gotta see the baby".
Is it possible they're just having babies to get people to visit them?
Hey, Jerry, you ever wear silk underwear?
-No.
-Put that on the top of your list.
No, not for me.
A little too delightful.
George and Jane should be almost there.
Isn't it weird that they haven't had sex but they're spending a weekend together?
George is pleased.
It's like she signed a letter of intent.
-When's Rachel coming out?
-The 3:00 train.
Her father is so religious.
I'm amazed he's letting you see her again after that Schindler's List make-out session.
I brought him some kishke.
-What's that?
-It's a stuffed meat thing.
Israeli soldiers carry it in case they're captured behind enemy lines.
They eat it and it kills them.
I never tasted a cough medicine I didn't love.
Me too.
I love cough medicine.
You see?
We were made for each other.
It's amazing.
If I reach out and touch her breast right now she'd scream and throw me out of the car.
But at this time tomorrow, I could touch it all I want.
-What's your favorite?
-Pertussin.
-Ever try it with club soda?
-No.
Oh, very refreshing.
Sex is like joining a private club.
I'll be the same me tomorrow but suddenly the "no trespassing" sign will be gone.
-Are we almost there?
-Yeah, about 1 0, 1 5 minutes.
But I have to stop at a vegetable stand.
-What for?
-My mother loves Hampton tomatoes.
She's nuts for Hampton tomatoes.
Can you buy them later?
I really wanna get some sun.
Hey, Jerry, rub some lotion on my back.
Who are you, Mrs. Robinson?
Come on.
I'll rub some on you.
-That's not sweetening the deal.
-Oh, come on.
No.
You know, when I was a kid I once found $ 1 .
50 in change at the bottom of a pool.
-You must have been excited.
-Yeah.
I gotta go get those tomatoes.
You wanna go?
-I don't think so.
-Okay.
I'll see you later.
-Anybody want some tomatoes?
-No, thanks.
I'm gonna take a dip.
And then there's Maude.
Look at my face.
Look at it.
-Do you see any lines?
-No lines.
You know why?
One word: shade.
So when are we gonna see this baby?
When is this momentous event?
He's taking a nap or something.
I'm gonna go see if there are any girls on the beach.
-Elaine, you wanna come?
-No, thanks.
I got plenty of girlfriends.
Well, this is interesting.
What?
Jane's topless.
Yo-Yo Ma.
Boutros Boutros-Golly.
Nice rack.
Come on, you guys.
You can come and see the baby now.
-Oh, in a minute, Carol.
-Yeah, we're gonna be right up.
This is weird, wild stuff.
George hasn't even seen her yet.
Why do you think we're getting the sneak preview?
Maybe she's trying to create a buzz.
-What?
-Get some good word of mouth going.
Oh, here she comes.
I'm thirsty.
Anyone want a drink?
No, thanks.
I'm good.
All right.
Show's over.
I'm going to the beach.
Adam, Jerry and Elaine are here.
Where is the cute little snuggly baby?
-Isn't he gorgeous?
-Oh, he's-- Is he gorgeous.
Gorgeous, yes.
So very gorgeous.
Michael, shut the door.
You're letting bugs in.
Is it me or was that the ugliest baby you have ever seen?
I couldn't look.
It was like a Pekingese.
Boy, a little too much chlorine in that gene pool.
The thing is, they'll never know.
No one's ever gonna tell them.
-You have to lie.
-Oh, it's a must-lie situation.
Yes.
It's a must-lie situation.
You know, I don't think we should tell George we saw Jane topless.
No.
I don't think so.
Remind me to tell Kramer too.
Lobster.
-Well, this ointment should do it.
-How are you feeling, Adam?
Elaine.
This is our pediatrician, Ben Pfeffer.
Hi.
Look at him, Elaine.
How gorgeous is he, I ask you?
How gorgeous?
Pretty gorgeous.
-Elaine, do you have children?
-Me?
No, but I'd love to have a baby.
I mean, I can't wait to have a baby.
I'm just dying to have a baby.
A beautiful woman like you should.
You're quite breathtaking.
Breathtaking?
I'm breathtaking?
And he's very particular.
Ben, you're staying over tonight, right?
Sure.
I. I'm gonna go pick up Rachel at the station.
-Yeah, see you.
-Okay.
Oh, just look at him.
Yeah, he really is breathtaking.
The train was so crowded, I had a seat facing the wrong way.
Oh, I like that.
It's like going back in time.
-Hey, Rachel.
-Hi.
-I'm gonna go in and get changed.
-Okay.
What kind of a greeting was that?
-She's got greeting problems.
-Yeah.
Boy, I love these Hampton tomatoes.
You know, you can eat them like apples.
It's funny.
The tomato never really took off as a hand fruit.
Well, the tomato's an anomaly.
So successful with the ketchup and the sauce but you can't find a good one.
Look at what I got!
The K-man!
You got lobster for everybody?
Yeah, and they're fresh.
Right out of the ocean!
This is fantastic.
Man, what a weekend!
Swimming, lobster for dinner.
I know.
It's great.
I saw Jane topless.
You saw who what?
Yeah, I saw Jane topless.
Well, we all saw her.
All right.
You saw Jane topless?
Well, when you went for the tomatoes, she lied out topless.
Oh, you mean facedown on her chest.
No.
-Faceup on her back?
-Yeah.
-Well, why'd she do that?
-Well, I guess she was hot.
You mean she just lay there topless?
No, no.
She got up, she walked around.
Walked around?
-And you looked?
-Of course.
She's got a great body, buddy.
All right, I'm gonna go upstairs.
I'll be right back.
I can't believe that you saw her before me!
Think of me as a doctor.
-Well, how good a look did you get?
-What do you mean?
Well, if she was a criminal and you had to describe her to a police sketch artist?
They'd pick her up in about 1 0 minutes.
Great.
Great.
So any time you want, you can just visualize her naked.
I guess that's true.
Stop it.
Stop it.
This is not fair!
It's not fair.
I don't like this.
I don't like it one bit.
What do you want me to do?
You wanna see Rachel naked?
Yes!
Yes!
-Yeah, right.
-The punishment should fit the crime.
You could see me naked.
I could offer you that.
It's like I'm Neil Armstrong.
I turn around for a sip of Tang and you jump out first!
Nobody ever called me breathtaking before.
I've never been called breathtaking either.
I mean, if he thinks that that baby is breathtaking then who's not breathtaking?
Maybe he just said it because the mother was in the room.
Yeah.
Right.
That's a possibility.
I have to find out.
-How you gonna do that?
-I can be very clever.
-I'm gonna take a swim.
-Oh, me too.
I'll meet you down there.
Don't go in.
Rachel's getting undressed.
Oh, okay.
-Hey!
-Oh, sorry.
-Don't you knock?
-I'm sorry.
Not like I'll see something I've never seen before.
-You might have.
-I didn't.
You won't.
What do you want anyway, George?
Yes, George.
I'm kind of wondering myself.
What is it that you want?
No, I was just wondering if you guys had any gum.
So you were swimming in the pool and you wanted some gum.
Yes, because the water was cold and the chewing warms me up.
We don't have any gum.
Okay.
Thanks anyway.
Strange man.
Wait till you get to know him.
-So where is this baby, anyway?
-Oh, check it out.
I guarantee you've never seen anything quite so objectionable.
It's down the hall, third door on your left.
Oh, my God!
I'm sorry, I thought this was the baby's room.
I'm really sorry.
I was in the pool!
I was in the pool!
Did she do it on purpose?
It was my fault.
I told her the wrong door.
I was supposed to see her.
She wasn't supposed to see me.
So what?
Well, ordinarily I wouldn't mind.
But.
But what?
Well, I'd just got back from swimming in the pool and the water was cold.
-You mean shrinkage.
-Yes.
Significant shrinkage.
So you feel you were shortchanged?
Yes.
If she thinks that's me, she's under a complete misapprehension.
That was not me, Jerry.
That was not me.
Well, so, what's the difference?
-What if she discusses it with Jane?
-Oh, she's not gonna tell Jane.
-How do you know?
-Women aren't like us.
They're worse!
They're much worse than us.
They talk about everything.
Could you tell her about the shrinkage factor?
No.
I'm not gonna tell her about your shrinkage.
Besides, I think women know about shrinkage.
How do women know about shrinkage?
Isn't it common knowledge?
-Elaine.
-Elaine.
Elaine!
-What?
-Do women know about shrinkage?
What do you mean, like laundry?
No.
Like when a man goes swimming, afterwards.
It shrinks?
Like a frightened turtle.
-Why does it shrink?
-It just does.
I don't know how you guys walk around with those things.
-Excellent lobster, Kramer.
-Really good.
Rachel, aren't you gonna have any?
No, I can't.
I'm kosher.
We don't eat shellfish.
You mean you've never tasted lobster?
No.
You're so pious.
I really respect that.
You know, when you die you're gonna get some special attention.
The baby's crying.
I'll go get him, he can sit with us.
No, no.
You don't want to do that.
-You'll be uncomfortable.
-Yeah.
Finish eating.
The baby's not gonna have any fun over here.
-We're not fun for a baby.
-Yeah.
The lobsters will scare him.
I'm gonna get him.
See?
Look at this.
Rachel, my T-shirt shrunk.
It used to be much bigger, and now it shrunk.
See, that's what water does.
It shrinks things.
Really?
Tell us more, Mr. Science.
What are you doing?
What are you laughing at?
-It's nothing, George.
-It's very impolite to tell secrets.
-Are you talking about me?
-What is it with you?
Easy, big fella.
Kramer, where did you get these lobsters?
-At MacLeish's Fish Market?
-No.
I got them in the ocean.
The ocean?
What do you mean?
Well, I found this rope and I kept tugging on it all these lobsters came up.
Those are commercial lobster traps.
You can't take lobsters from there.
-That's against the law.
-Hey, take it easy.
There are plenty of lobsters in the ocean for everyone.
My father was a lobsterman.
He got up every morning at 4 and came home at night stinking of brine.
He sent me through law school with the lobsters he caught.
Here he is.
-Some night, huh?
-Yeah.
I wish I had my telescope.
-Some dinner, huh?
-Yeah.
Nothing like really fresh-caught lobster.
Some house, huh?
It was built by Mark Farbman.
He built a lot of these homes here.
Some ugly baby, huh?
-What did you say?
-I said "some snuggly baby".
He is something.
Well, to tell you the truth, Dr. Pfeffer I was surprised to hear you use a word like "breathtaking" to describe a baby.
I mean, because you also used it referring to me.
Well, you know, Elaine, sometimes you say a thing like that just to be nice.
You told her?
-Yeah.
What's the big deal?
-You don't understand this organ.
It's very schizophrenic.
Anyway, what's the difference?
You're the ones who are obsessed with this stuff, not us.
I'm sure it wouldn't matter to Jane.
You're going back to New York now?
Yeah.
I have some things to do tomorrow.
I think you spoke to your little friend Rachel, that's what I think.
So what if I did?
And she didn't say something to you about a certain something?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I think that you think that a certain something is not all that it could be when, in fact, it is all that it should be and more.
-I'm sure it is.
-Look, you don't understand.
There was shrinkage.
You looking for this?
Oh, Kramer.
You startled me.
Well, I thought you might wind up around here.
Yeah, well, I couldn't stop thinking about the way everybody was enjoying the lobster so much.
And, well, I thought a little taste couldn't hurt.
-May I?
-No, I'm afraid I couldn't do that.
-Why not?
-Well, now, it wouldn't be kosher.
Come on, Kramer.
I really wanna try it.
No, I'm sorry, honey.
Not on my watch.
Come on, Kramer.
I just heard a car drive out.
What was that?
Oh, just Jane driving back to New York in the middle of the night.
George, thanks so much for making breakfast.
These are the best scrambled eggs ever.
I didn't know you could cook.
Well, I'm just expressing my gratitude to our gracious host.
Yes, George, the whole breakfast is breathtaking.
-Good morning.
-Hey!
-Hey, morning.
-Morning.
Kramer, I wanna thank you again for last night.
-You really saved me.
-What happened?
Well, I almost tried the lobster but Kramer stopped me.
Well, I knew you'd regret it for the rest of your life.
You're right.
I would have.
Hey, look at this guy.
-A little breakfast?
-Yeah.
-And you eat eggs, don't you?
-Yes, I do.
-All right.
-Thank you.
Delicious.
Where did you learn to make eggs like this?
These are so good.
Enjoying them?
Oh, good.
You know, you might wanna try eating it with one of these.
There's lobster in these eggs?
Not that much.
You know, they tend to shrink in the water.
Well, I guess I gotta go too.
Well, this has turned out to be one hell of a weekend.
Excuse me.
Sorry to bother you.
We're trying to track down a lobster poacher that cleaned out one of the traps.
I wonder what's going on.
Guess I should go up and apologize.
-There he is, officer.
-Yeah.
Don't you ever knock?
!
I don't know why Rachel had to drive back with Michael and Carol.
Hey, if you saw me naked I wouldn't wanna ride in the same car with you either.
I still can't believe Michael finked on Kramer.
How is he gonna pay off a $ 1 000 fine?
They got some sort of program.
What?
Hey, there's a tomato stand.
Let's stop.
I can get some more.
Hey, isn't that Michael's car?
-There's Rachel.
-Where?
Look at the work that people will do to get to the ocean.
They'll fight traffic and the heat and the parking and the hot sand trying to get through the waves and the ironic thing is the ocean doesn't even really want us in there.
That's what surfing is.
Surfing is the ocean throwing us out of itself.
You see?
We keep trying to paddle in and the ocean is saying, "No, you don't".
The ocean is like a nightclub and the waves are bouncers tossing us out.
The undertow is like the really mean bouncer.
Instead of throwing you out, they take you in the back and rough you up.
"Oh, you wanna come in?
How about coming in like 25 miles"?
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
It's hard to justify, at this point in history the existence of men and their handkerchiefs.
I mean, they open it up, blow their nose in it then put it in their pocket with their other valuables.
Wallet, keys, mucous.
Yup, got everything.
Is it because men can't give birth are they just proud of anything that comes out of us?
We'll actually have a monogram sewn onto it.
What is the source of pride here?
It sticks out of our breast pocket of our jacket.
I have a snot rag.
-To your promotion.
-Oh, thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Lippman.
I can't tell you how much I appreciate this.
I mean, of course, I deserve it.
Well, you're really on your way now.
You should do something about that cold.
-You got a raise?
-I don't fool around, baby.
You said Pendant was in financial trouble.
But they're being absorbed by Matsushimi that big Japanese conglomerate.
-When did that happen?
-Papers are signed next week.
Are they publishing Kramer's coffee table book?
Yeah.
They'll definitely do it now.
You're on quite a streak.
Job promotion.
-Plus you're back with Jake Jarmel.
-Yeah, it's getting serious.
We're talking about moving in together.
You've got it all.
Helen Gurley Brown would be very proud of you.
Speaking of having it all.
Where were you?
I went to the beach.
The beach.
It's not working, Jerry.
-It's just not working.
-What is it that isn't working?
Why did it all turn out like this for me?
I had so much promise.
I was personable.
I was bright.
Maybe not academically speaking, but.
I was perceptive.
I always know when someone's uncomfortable at a party.
-Got a napkin?
-It all became very clear to me sitting out there today that every decision I've ever made in my entire life has been wrong.
My life is the complete opposite of everything I want it to be.
Every instinct I have in every aspect of life be it something to wear, something to eat it's all been wrong.
Every one.
Tuna on toast, coleslaw -cup of coffee.
-Yeah.
No, no, wait a minute.
I always have tuna on toast.
Nothing's ever worked out for me with tuna on toast.
I want the complete opposite of tuna on toast.
Chicken salad on rye untoasted with a side of potato salad and a cup of tea.
Well, there's no telling what can happen from this.
Chicken salad is not the opposite of tuna.
Salmon's the opposite of tuna because salmon swim against the current, and the tuna swim with it.
Good for the tuna.
George, you know that woman just looked at you.
So what?
What am I supposed to do?
Go talk to her.
Elaine, bald men with no jobs and no money who live with their parents don't approach strange women.
Try the opposite.
Instead of tuna salad and being intimidated by women, chicken salad -and going right up to them.
-Yeah, I should do the opposite.
If every instinct you have is wrong then the opposite would have to be right.
Yes.
I will do the opposite.
I used to sit here and do nothing and regret it for the rest of the day.
So now I will do the opposite, and I will do something.
Excuse me.
I couldn't help but notice that -you were looking in my direction.
-Oh, yes, I was.
You just ordered the same exact lunch as me.
My name is George.
I'm unemployed, and I live with my parents.
I'm Victoria.
Hi.
Are you kidding?
They can't cancel that show on me now.
It's too late for me to book anything else for that weekend.
All right, all right.
Okay, bye.
Hey.
Buddy, it's all happening.
-What's happening?
-The coffee table book.
It's a go.
-I heard all about it.
-Know what this means?
I'm starting the book tour.
First stop, Regis and Kathie Lee.
You're going on Regis and Kathie Lee?
Oh, you better believe it.
-I'll loan you my puffy shirt.
-No, no.
That's not-- What are you gonna talk about?
Coffee tables.
Hello.
What?
Sure.
I'll do it.
I just had something canceled the same weekend.
Okay.
Great.
Bye.
Life is amazing.
I just lost a job, and five minutes later get another job, same weekend, same money.
You know who you are?
Even Steven.
Are you growing a beard?
Why shave every day?
Just grows right back.
I guess.
I'm afraid I'm just not interested in how I present myself.
If those kind of superficialities are important to you this probably isn't gonna work.
Hey, watch it.
They cut you off.
Did you see that?
Take it easy.
Take it easy.
It's not the end of the world.
Hey, baby, how about a little tongue action, huh?
Stick your tongue down his throat.
What are we gonna do?
Should we just move?
That won't be necessary.
Shut your traps and stop kicking the seats!
We're trying to watch the movie!
If I have to tell you again, I'll show you what it's like.
You understand me?
Now shut your mouths, or I'll shut them for you.
If you think I'm kidding, just try me.
Try me.
Because I would love it!
Are you sure you don't wanna come up?
It's only 9:30.
I don't think we should.
We really don't know each other very well.
Who are you, George Costanza?
I'm the opposite of every guy you've ever met.
-Excuse me.
Is your name Elaine?
-Yes.
Were you supposed to meet a Jake Jarmel here?
-Yeah.
-I'm afraid he's been in an accident.
-An accident?
What happened?
-He got sideswiped by a cab but he's all right.
He's in St. Vincent Hospital, room 90 7.
Okay, thank you.
Could I have a box of Jujyfruits?
Here you go.
So, you know, the light was clearly green.
I started walking, he skidded, and went right into my hip.
That is so terrible.
It's so terrible, Jake.
I mean, how can people be so stupid?
It's just sickening.
-Want one?
-No, thanks.
So when do you think you're gonna get out of here?
-Where did you get those?
-At the movies.
Didn't you get the message before you went in?
Yeah.
-Then when did you get those?
-Right after that.
So you heard that I was in a car accident and then decided to stop off for some Jujyfruit?
Well the counter was right there and-- I'd think, under the circumstances, you would've run out of the building.
Apparently, it didn't have any effect on you.
-No, no.
It did.
-lf you got into a car accident I can guarantee you I wouldn't stop for Jujyfruits.
-But, Jake-- -I would like to be alone now, please.
-But, Jake, I didn't-- -Good night.
-What do you say we call it a night?
-Good idea.
I'm kind of tired.
-How'd you do?
-Won 50.
-Lost 72.
-Won 3 7.
-Lost 1 5.
-Broke even.
-Can I bring out our next guest now?
-Please.
Young guy, got a new book coming out, and it's about-- And this is the best part.
It's a coffee table book -about coffee tables.
-Is that clever?
I think that is so clever.
I think so too.
-Did you meet him backstage?
-I did.
He looks like a fun guy, doesn't he?
-I love his hair.
-Oh, I do too.
This guy could be a little bonkos.
Anyway, if you will, would you please welcome Kramer.
-Hey.
-How are you?
Look, Kramer's here.
-Hi.
-Hello.
I don't know.
It's the hair or something.
I don't know.
Yes.
Kramer.
So a coffee table book about coffee tables.
-Where'd you get this idea?
-Well, I'll tell you, Regis.
Actually, this is a true story.
-I was skiing at the time.
-When I'm skiing, Kramer I'm trying not to kill myself.
You're writing books.
You kids, don't go out and try that.
You stay in school.
Have you always been interested in coffee tables?
Really, I love coffee tables, and I thought I was the only one.
See, the beauty of my book is, if you don't have a coffee table it turns into a coffee table.
-Is that fabulous?
-Look at this.
Is that fabulous?
-Fabulous.
-I want one of those.
Did I tell you this guy was bonkos?
This coffee table is full of pictures of celebrities' coffee tables.
-That's right.
-I'm not in there.
Where's mine?
It's on file right here.
I'm telling you, this guy's bonkos.
He really is.
-But he's adorable.
-Yes he is.
He's a nice-Iooking guy.
All over my Kathie Lee Casuals.
We'll be right back in a moment.
-So it's over?
-Yeah.
-It got pretty nasty.
-What did you go back for, Jujyfruit?
It's not like I went across the street.
I bought them and got in a cab.
Why didn't you eat it in the cab?
Because I got popcorn too.
I ate that first.
-What is all this?
-I played cards last night.
-Yeah?
How'd you do?
-Broke even.
-You always break even.
-Like yesterday, I lost a job and then I got another one.
Then I missed a TV show, and later on they reran it.
Today I missed a train, went outside and caught a bus.
It never fails.
I always even out.
-Give me 20 bucks.
-What for?
Just give me 20 bucks.
What the hell was that?
Let's see if you get the 20 bucks back.
You could've thrown a pencil out the window and seen if that comes back.
Things were going so good for me.
I got the job promotion.
We were talking about moving in together.
Maybe next time someone's in a car accident you won't stop off for candy first.
Hey, I just found $20.
I tell you this, something is happening in my life.
I did this opposite thing last night.
Up was down, black was white, good was-- -Bad?
-Day was-- -Night.
-Yes.
-So you did the opposite of everything.
-Yes.
And listen to this.
Her uncle works for the Yankees and is getting me a job interview.
A front office kind of thing.
Assistant to the traveling secretary.
A job with the New York Yankees!
This has been the dream of my life ever since I was a child.
It's all happening because I'm completely ignoring every urge towards common sense and good judgment I've ever had.
This is no longer just some crazy notion.
Elaine, Jerry this is my religion.
Well, I guess your messiah would be the Antichrist.
That's funny.
Come on.
Let's go.
Elaine.
Look, a 20.
Oh, my God.
-Hey, boss.
-Kramer, come in.
How you doing there, big guy?
-Hey.
Yeah.
Have a seat.
-Alrighty.
You got yourself a cold?
Well, that's quite a honk.
-Thank you.
-Get yourself some vitamin C with rose hips and bioflavonoids.
The reason I asked you in here is I caught your appearance -on Regis and Kathie Lee.
-It was pretty good.
And anyway the thinking here is that it would be best if you didn't do any more of these shows.
-Because of the coffee thing?
-Kramer, I'm sorry.
What about Sonya Live?
You're not canceling Sonya Live.
-It's out-- -She's a doctor.
I got a thing for her.
Why don't you tell me about some of your previous work experience.
Alrighty.
My last job was in publishing.
I got fired for having sex in my office with the cleaning woman.
-Go on.
-All right.
Well, before that I was in real estate.
I quit because my boss wouldn't let me use his private bathroom.
That was a-- Do you talk to everybody like this?
-Of course.
-My niece told me you were different.
I am different, yeah.
I gotta tell you, you are the complete opposite of every applicant we've seen.
Mr. Steinbrenner, sir.
There's someone here I'd like you to meet.
This is Mr. Costanza.
He's one of the applicants.
Nice to meet you.
Well, I wish I could say the same, but I must say, with all due respect I find it hard to see the logic behind some of the moves you have made with this fine organization.
In the past 20 years, you have caused myself and the city of New York a good deal of distress, as we have watched you take our beloved Yankees and reduce them to a laughingstock, all for the glorification of your massive ego.
Hire this man.
-Tina Robbins is here to see you.
-Who's that?
My ex-roommate.
She moved out four years ago.
I've been subletting my apartment from her.
-See you.
-Yeah.
-Hey.
-Please.
-Hi, Tina.
-Hi, Elaine.
So I haven't seen you in a while.
Elaine, we have a problem.
-Well, what is it?
-You're getting kicked out.
Kicked out?
Why?
-There's been a number of complaints.
-Yeah?
Like what?
Well, like last Thanksgiving you buzzed up a jewel thief.
I didn't know who he was.
That's why there's a buzzer.
-What else?
-Apparently, the week after that you buzzed up some Jehovah's Witnesses and they couldn't get them out.
-What else you got?
-Well, let's see.
I'll tell you what the big advantage of homosexuality is.
If you're going out with someone your size right there, you double your wardrobe.
-I suppose.
-Oh, come on.
That's a huge feature.
When they approach a new recruit I'm sure that's one of the big selling points.
-Jerry.
-Yes.
I've been doing a lot of thinking.
I don't think we should see each other anymore.
That's okay.
-What?
-It's fine.
No problem.
-I'll meet somebody else.
-You will?
Sure.
See, things always even out for me.
It's fine.
Anyway, it's been really nice dating you for a while -and good luck.
-Yeah, you too.
-The New York Yankees?
-The New York Yankees.
Ruth, Gehrig, DiMaggio, Mantle Costanza?
I'm the assistant to the traveling secretary.
I'm going on the road trips.
I'll be on the plane.
I'm working in Yankee Stadium.
This is a dream.
I'm busting.
-Jerry, I'm busting.
-I can't believe it.
Yeah.
-Yeah?
-It's me.
-Come on up.
-I'm out of my parent's house.
I'm taking that apartment on 86th Street.
-That's a great place.
-I'm back in business, baby.
Don't get too excited about this stuff.
You know, things have a way of evening out.
Hey!
-Hey, Elaine.
-Hi.
How are things going?
You wanna know how things are going?
I'll tell you how things are going.
I am getting kicked -out of my apartment.
-Why are they doing that?
I don't know.
They have a list of grievances.
-The jewel thief?
-Yeah, the jewel thief.
-What else?
-I put Canadian quarters in the washing machine.
I gotta be out by the end of the month.
Well, you could move in with my parents.
Was that the opposite of what you were going to say or was that just your natural instinct?
Instinct.
Stick with the opposite.
Elaine, don't get too down.
Everything will even out.
See, I have two friends.
You were up, he was down.
Now he's up, you're down.
See how it all evens out for me?
Mr. Lippman, the people from Matsushimi are here.
All right.
Tell them I'll be right there.
Oh, man.
Well, this is it, Elaine.
You know, without this merger, we'd be out on the street.
Boy, they sure saved us.
Mr. Lippman, you forgot your handkerchief.
Mr. Lippman.
You forgot your handkerchief.
It's on my desk.
Lippman-san.
Lippman-san.
Mr. Lippman, it is with great pride that we undertake this partnership -with your company.
-I'm sorry.
I can't shake your hand right now.
Germs.
No, l-- -Is that the end of it?
-It's the last one.
I can't believe you're moving out.
Kramer, is this true?
Is it really happening?
It's like a dream.
-Oh, it's true.
-All right, let's go.
Don't get in trouble with the Yankees.
You be nice.
I'm not gonna be nice.
That's how I got the job.
-Jerry, did you hear this?
-He knows what he's doing.
I just want the both of you to know how much you mean to me and I love you both very, very much.
Opposite.
I must've had eight in my mouth.
I couldn't talk.
I couldn't talk.
Why'd you have to eat so many?
Because they're Jujyfruit.
I like them.
I didn't know it would start a chain reaction that would lead to the end of Pendant Publishing.
Not to mention the end of Kramer's book.
You knew he had a cold.
How did you expect him to blow his nose?
Do you know what's going on here?
Can't you see what's happened?
I've become George.
Don't say that.
It's true.
I'm George.
I'm George.
Greetings, people.
Greetings.
Greetings and salutations.
What a beautiful day for a ball game.
Let's play two.
I'll have the chicken salad on rye, my usual.
You know what I get, darling.
So I had a little conversation today with Mr. Don Mattingly.
He's the first baseman.
We talked about his new batting stance.
I'm not crazy about it.
But I said, "Donnie, go with it till it stops working".
Donnie Baseball.
He's a hell of a guy.
Wait, wait.
That's too much.
Mine was more than yours.
Let's call it even.
Coffee is a drink that encourages a lot of accessories around it.
Coffee cake, coffee table, coffee table book, klatches of people.
Say what you want about alcohol, but not only aren't there a lot of optional accessories, alcohol actually helps you get rid of things.
Family, home, job, driver's license.
The only thing you have to remember to get is more alcohol.
And maybe a rag for your squeegee.
