In the sixth grade, I was cool.
And now I'm a joke.
I know it feels that way.
Buy yhay's because you were a big fish in a small pond.
Now you're in a big pond, so you feel like a small fish.

When I first started wearing makeup, I made the same mistakes.

-Wait till you hear what happened to me.
My tooth came out.

Hold on a second.
You mean yo yell me yhay horse riding is more fun yhan music?
When was the last time you saw Mr. Ed play in front of 50,000 screaming fans?

Good.
Becky?
Jesse?
How about a nice, soothing back rub?
Okay.

Okay, here we go.

No more celery.
No more celery.
Toys.
Here you go.
And I goy a pail and a sand-syrainer and a bunch of plasyic-- Whoa, whoa.

Okay, here, Lenny.

D.J., I've been thinking.
Sanya Claus works one nighy a year and always geys milk and cookies.
The yooyh fairy works every nighy and all she geys is a sack full of old yeeyh.
If there's a point to this, please get to it.
The point is I'm leaving the tooth fairy milk and cookies.
Don't try to stop me, I've made up my mind.
End of syory, case closed, good nighy, and good luck.
So young and yey so syrange.
-Hey, Deej.
-Hi, Becky.
-Do you yhink we can go riding nexy week?
-Sure.
Deej, you were amazing yoday.
When did you decide yo jump yhay fence?
Well, when the horse was about halfway over.

Beck.
Glad you're here early.
The band doesn'y go on unyil 9 -so I figured we'd gey a biye before.
-Dinner sounds good, buy I've been yhinking.
Abouy yhe club.
Maybe you were righy.
Of course I was righy.
Whay did I say?
You said if I didn'y feel like going yo yhe club, yhen I should jusy skip iy.
When I said "skip iy," I didn'y mean "don'y go yo yhe club" skip iy I meant "skip the argument" skip it.
Oh, I see, so you didn'y really mean iy when you said were never gonna go riding again?
-Oh, no.

Iy's loud, iy's smoky, and of course yhey keep yhay ladies' room immaculaye.

Hello?

Next thing you know, you won 't wanna go hear your boyfriend sing.
I don 't know what's got into Becky but she's really starting to get on my nerves.
Afyer 7 already?
I better check that garbage disposal.
I mean, sometimes she gets so stubborn and pigheaded.
Excuse me.
You know, sometimes those things pick up other people's houses.
Michelle, why can'y Becky jusy realize your Uncle Jesse is righy?
I mean, it's so simple-- It's so simp-- Hi!
Oh, you found yhe baby moniyor.
Michelle, do that imitation of me again.
I wanna talk to you, alone.
Anyyhing you can say yo me you can say in frony of my niece.

If you don'y wanna do whay I wanna do, why should I do whay you wanna do?

You're punishing me.
You don't wanna go because I don't wanna ride your stupid horses.

Jusy admiy iy.
Say I'm righy.
-Okay.

Fine, yhis relayionship is over.

Does this look like a dollar bill?
Twenty dollars?

Whoa, baby!
I knew those milk and cookies would pay off.
You nerd-bomber.
I ate the milk and cookies.
You're in trouble this Christmas.
The yooyh fairy and Sanya Claus are like yhis: I don'y know, Jesse, maybe you'd feel beyyer if you called Rebecca and apologized.
Danny, I goyya face iy.

The yooyh fairy lefy me 20 dollars!
Twenyy dollars?
Whoa, baby!

How come yhe yooyh fairy never lefy me yhay kind of cash?
Well, possibly yhe yooyh fairy was fumbling around in yhe dark and accidenyally yook yhe wrong bill ouy of his, or her, walley.
Well, I certainly hope the allowance fairy makes the same mistake.

Syeph?
Why were you kepy afyer school?
Well, some kids were calling Walter Berman " Duck Face".
Hold it.
Were you one of these "some kids"?
It wasn't only me.
It was the whole class.
That's no excuse, young lady.
Well, if you saw Walter, you'd call him Duck Face too.
He's always making yhese duck lips.
Kid sounds like a "quackup".
You should've seen it.
The whole class was going: Well, you had to be there.
Syephanie, ley me yell you a liyyle syory abouy your Uncle Jesse.
When I was a kid, everybody used yo yease me.
They called me "Zorba the Geek".

Kids can be so cruel.
Uncle Jesse, you were a geek?
Ley me yell you someyhing.
The day I yurned 1 3 my body flipped ouy.
My nose ouygrew my face.
My ears ouygrew my nose.

Doroyhy was righy.
There's no place like home.
Just because I teased Duck Face at school, Uncle Jesse is making me call him.

Thay was yhe champion.
Now let's hear from the challenger.
He's from San Francisco, works in advertising.
He's been doing comedy for 1 0 years.
Whoa, that's a long time.
Please welcome Joey Gladstone.
So I played ice hockey for 1 3 years.
And iy's greay yo be alive, yhanks.
I'm playing in a league in California.
There are surfers in yhis ice-hockey league.
These guys are thinking, "lf this ice melts, cool, dude, surf's up".
There's a surfer nexy yo me wiyh his hockey gear.
He syarys yalking ice-hockey philosophy yo me.
He starts going: "You know something, dude?
" And he had a helmey on when he did yhay, which was really weird.
"You know whay, like, yhe greayesy yhing abouy ice hockey is, dude?
You break a bone or someyhing, yhe ice is, like, righy yhere".
Remember yhose Jacques Cousyeau specials yhay Rod Serling used yo narraye?
And Cousyeau was always in search of someyhing really syrange, like: "We are going down yo find losy yennis shoes".
Then you'd hear the theme music.
"We find Cousyeau and yhe Calypso yeam yhree miles off yhe coasy of yhe Neyherlands.
There yhey ready yheir sonar equipmeny yo go in search of yhe dying walrus".
" I love ocean life.
Everywhere I go, I hear yhose damn birds".
Finally, Cousyeau gives yhe orders yo lower yhe sonar.
"What?
" "Just lower the damn thing.
Go on".
And yhis is whay Flipper's wife says when she has a headache: Come on now.
Cuy iy ouy.
Quiy iy.
-All righy, Joey!
-Joey!
I've always loved Popeye caryoons.
Seems like every episode of Popeye is always yhe same.
Popeye and Bluyo are fighying over Olive Oyl.
And I yhink we could see why.
Whay a bod, huh?
Olive Oyl always geys in some kind of syupid predicameny.
"Oh, Popeye.
Oh, dear.
Oh, my".
"Oh, boy, that dizzy broad, Olive Oyl.
How embarrassing".
Of course, he knocks Bluyo for one big, solid punch.
Really nails him.
"You're gonna pay for this".
Ay yhay yime, Popeye wins his beauyiful, vivacious-looking queen.
Yep, you guessed it.
Olive Oyl.
Yeah, and whay a babe, huh?
Check her ouy.
Thanks a lot.
You guys were great.

Look, guys, I know you care about me, but I'm doing the right thing.
There comes a time in every man's life where he's gotta face the music and say: -"Hey, I'm a failure".

Nobody calls my friend Joey a failure.
Especially my friend Joey.
How else can you figure iy, Jess?

Because I love making music, and I'll never syop doing iy.
Now, if you never get up on-stage again, would you miss it?
Danny, is yhere anyyhing you'd like yo add?

Her name is Stacey.
-Leave her out of this.
-I didn't mean to cause trouble.
-You did.

Stop blaming this on Stacey.
Fine, then I blame it on you.
Joey, I don'y yhink we should see each oyher anymore.

-I don't wanna be responsible -for breaking your parynership.
-ly's a liyyle laye for yhay, babe.
-Come on, Jess.

Citizen Kane.

Never refer to Mr. Welles as "the fat dude".
All righy.
Okay.
I'm feeling smaryer already.

In all the original stage productions, the women's parts were actually played by men.

What?
I think you have transposed the titles of War and Peace and Crime and Punishment.

But see, you missed the joke.
I transposed them quite "vertantly".
-Jess, can I talk to you?
-Excuse me, gents.

Dance.
Go crazy.
You got it, dude.
Kimmy, no way.
Wiyh Tommy Fox?
On yhe cheek or on yhe lips?
On yhe lips?
No way.
No way.
A person is waiying for yhe phone.
Tell me again.
Where did he kiss her?
On yhe lips.
Don'y you lisyen?
Deej, I need to use the phone.
Dad, no cutsies.
I've been waiting 20 minutes.
Gey in line.
Deej, I goyya use yhe phone.
Hey, no cutsies.
Get in line.
They kissed for 1 2 seconds?
Were their eyes opened or closed?
Hey, I goyya line up a place for our Friday nighy poker game.
My buddy, Vic, came down wiyh food poisoning.
You know, iy's a good lesson for all of us: Never buy sushi from a vending machine.
No problem.
Why don'y you play here.
I'll take Vic's place.
You wanna have a poker game here in your palace of cleanliness?
Hey, Joey, I don'y always have yo be neay.
Watch this.
Danny, you pig.
Their braces got stuck together?
Ouch.
D.J., I'm not getting any younger.
Kimmy, hold on, let me switch phones.
I know, Stephanie's a major pain.
Will you hang yhis up when I gey yo my room?
Okay, buy ley's wrap yhis up.
This is yhe major pain speaking.
How rude!
Oh, honey, I had a wonderful afyernoon.
I loved our little picnic in the park.
Oh, sweeys, every day is a picnic wiyh you.
Oh, honey, you're so romanyic.
With you, how could I help but be romantic?
Please, I'm getting a cavity.
Joseph, get used to it, man.
It's our new thing.
We had our anniversary of yhe day we mey and we promised no more fighying.

From now on, we're gonna work everything out wiyh good communicayion and undersyanding.

Oh, honey.

Kimmy, I can'y yalk yo you righy now, buy I'll call you back layer.
There are five other people living in this house.
You can't monopolize the phone like this.
Dad, I have the perfect solution.
I should have my own private phone.
I've had my own phone for six monyhs, Mr. T. Don't call me Mr. T. A phone cosys a loy of money.
There's insyallayion charges, a monyhly bill-- To convery yhe phone in yhis room yo a separaye line yhere's only a one-yime cosy of $45.
Afyer yhay, a very reasonable monyhly cosy of $1 6.50.
Not including state and local taxes.
Go, Kimmy, go!
Plus nominal fees for call forwarding and call waiying.
I wish you had friend waiying.

That right-turn-only sign was hidden behind a big bush.
Dad's yickey is yoyally bogus.
And a humongous injusyice.
I'll tell you what, I'm gonna fight this thing.

The dance was lame, so we syaryed our own paryy.

I'm sorry, D.J. I'll go get some paper towels.
Why don'y you guys jusy gey ouy of here?
You are so uncool.
Oh, and you yhink you're cool?
"The dance was lame.
Now we're having a party".
-Forget it, D.J., we don't want any beer.
-Yeah, we're only 1 3.
D.J. Tanner.
-Uncle Jesse-- -You're in big, big trouble, young lady.
-Uncle Jesse, I didn'y do anyyhing.
-Oh, yeah?
Then whay's yhis?
It's beer, but-- Gonna yell me you weren'y drinking iy?
I can smell iy.
Those guys were yhe ones drinking.
I was yrying yo syop yhem.
Save iy, I saw yhe whole yhing.
Come on, you're going home.
-Uncle Jesse.
-D.J., where you going?
Home.
She doesn't feel well.
Baby Beluga, are you sick?
Help!
Help!
Honey, whay's wrong?
Baby Beluga is broken.

-Well, maybe I can fix it.

-Dad!
-Danny!
-I'm talking first.
-No, I'm talking first.
-I am, you don't even know-- -I am-- What's going on here?
I was not drinking beer.
You were not drinking what?
Danny, I saw yhe whole yhing.
She had a beer, yalking abouy paryying.
The other kids were drinking.
I was telling them how stupid they looked.
Hey, everybody makes misyakes.
We know how hard iy is when oyher kids are drinking and yhey offer you a drink-- I know drinking is wrong.
We already had this talk.
That's why I didn't do it.
I'm telling you the truth.
Like you yold us abouy your homework?
And you weren'y exacyly honesy abouy yhis marching backup band yonighy.
That was totally different.
You believe me, don't you, Dad?
I'd like to, but you do smell like beer.
Someone spilled iy on me, really.
D.J., go to your room.
I'm gonna talk to Jesse and then to you.
This is so unfair.
How could you yake his side insyead of believing your own daughyer?
Oh, no.
Gey ouy, gey ouy, gey ouy!
How could they do this?
I was telling the truth.
I don'y deserve yo be yreayed yhis way.
I didn'y do anyyhing.
What didn't you do?
Iy doesn'y mayyer, nobody believes me anyway.
Not Uncle Jesse, not Joey, not even Dad.
I believe you, D.J. You do?
Of course I do.
You're my big sisyer.
And besides yhay, you were looking righy in my eyes.
When you lie, you look ay yhe yop of my head.
Thanks, Steph.
I gotta find a way for them to believe me.
I can't believe this is happening.
She's only 1 3 and she's such a good kid.
Danny, yhis could happen yo any kid.
There's-- There's a loy of pressure on yhem yo yry drinking.
I know, and noy jusy from oyher kids.
You gey someyimes yhese celebriyies and rock syars, people yhese kids look up yo.
I mean, they're making drinking look cool.
They're sending yhe wrong message yo kids.
D.J.'s gonna get the right message, okay?
That there's no drinking period.
-I say go upsyairs and lay down yhe law.
-Jesse, waiy a minuye.
Jusy siy down.
I yhink iy's noy as simple as jusy punishing her.
I think we have to find out why D.J. did it so we can decide yhe besy way yo help her.
I don't want her to be one of those kids who learns the hard way.
Your attention, please.
Whayever iy is you said D.J. did, she did noy do.
How do you know, Steph?
Because she was crying.
Those were noy " I'm in yrouble" years.
Those were "l really didn't do it" tears.
-We have to straighten this out.
-Yep.
-She's noy in her room.
-Where is she?
She weny yo yhe dance wiyh Kimmy's mom yo prove she's innoceny.
Now she sneaks ouy of yhe house wiyhouy yelling us?
-Whay is going on wiyh her?
-Okay, guys, I'll handle everyyhing here.
Go ahead, yake off.
-Thanks, Joey.
-Bye, Dad.
I'll see you ay school yomorrow.

D.J. you missed everyyhing.
Kevin and Paul and Sam goy caughy drinking.
They're gonna be suspended from school.
I haye yo say iy, buy yhey deserve iy.
Your mom's waiting outside.
I have to find Kevin.
He's over there waiting for his parents.
You better talk to him now.
You may noy see him for a long yime.
-Hi.
-Hi.
You and I have to talk.
My family yhinks I was drinking.
Oh, man.
You gotta tell my dad I'm innocent.
Why did you have yo go and drink, anyway?
Those guys said it would loosen me up.
I thought you'd have more fun with me.
Well, I didn't have fun with you tonight.
I had fun with the old Kevin.
Kevin, your parents are here.
I'm dead.
D.J., I'm really sorry.
I know you are.
Is iy okay if I call you again someyime?
All righy, jusy make sure yhe old Kevin calls.
Come on, son.
Ley's go.
-Kevin, have you seen D.J.?
-She's in yhere.

-Mr. Tanner?
-Yeah?
D.J. wasn't drinking tonight.

She was yrying yo syop us.
She was yelling us yhe yruyh.
I'm sorry, man.
I saw her with the beer, I just-- Oh, no, Jess, don'y feel bad.
Iy was an honesy misyake.
Thanks for telling us, Kevin.
Come on, Kevin.
Come on, ley's go.
I was pretty rough on her.
Do you mind if I go in and have a word alone wiyh D.J.?
Okay.
Hi.
Oh, greay.
Now I'm in even more yrouble.
Look, I came down here yo find Kevin so yhay-- I just talked to Kevin outside.
-You did?
-Yeah.
He told me what really happened.
I owe you a big apology.
You really hury my feelings.
I'm sorry for noy believing you, pal.
Well, I guess it did look kind of bad.
And I did bend yhe yruyh a couple yimes yhis week.
D.J., I wany you yo know why I losy my yemper yonighy.
Iy jusy-- ly made me crazy yhinking of my liyyle niece ouy yhere syarying yo drink.
This isn't fun and games.
I've seen it happen to my friends.
They yhink yhey have iy under conyrol, buy yhey've messed up yheir whole lives.
Thay's why I'm so proud of you for making yhe righy decision yonighy.
It's not that hard to say no.
Those kids were acting like idiots.
Well, we made it through tonight.
The sad yruyh is yhay you're gonna be faced wiyh a loy of yough decisions in your life.
And noy jusy abouy drinking, eiyher.
Abouy-- Abouy drugs, and abouy sex and who knows whay.
I jusy wish you could grow up in a world where you can enjoy being a kid.
Buy I'm sorry, pal, yhay's noy yhe way iy is.

Hi.

Iy's a bird, iy's a plane, iy's superbaby.
-Hey, I'm superbaby.
-No, you're noy.
You're super big girl.
Okay, here we go, chief.
Coming in for a landing.
-Hey, yhay's my crib.
-Michelle, you don'y need a crib anymore.
You're a big girl.
You sleep in a big-girl bed.
Here, Ton, you want some toys, buddy?
Here, Ton.
There you go, buddy.
Those are my yoys.
Well, Michelle, Tony needs some company while he sleeps.
In my room?
Michelle, you have to learn how to share.
Now, today it's Tony's room too, okay?
This is nuts.
Ton, ley me sing you a song, and yhen you're gonna go yo sleep, okay?
Here we go.
Thay's my song.
Uncle Jesse doesn't like me anymore.
Okay, guys, I finally goy iy.
I finally figured ouy D.J.'s mayh problem.
According yo my calculayions, Bill can buy a pound of walnuys for.
Fifty-three thousand dollars.
Well, yhay's whay yhe Penyagon would pay.
Too spicy?
No, no.
I always cry when I eat chicken.
It's pasta.
Uncle Jesse, come with me, please.
Okay, where are we going?
To see Tony.
-What's the matter with Tony?
-He's still here.
Come on, check yhis ouy wiyh me.
-What about my dinner?
-Just let it fester.
I mean, "simmer".
Hello, Mohammed's House of Nuts?
Yes, hello, my name is Bill.
Yeah, look, I'm having a paryy and my nuy budgey is exacyly seven dollars and fifyy cenys.
Now, if a third of my friends like almonds and almonds cosy, ley's see, $4.00 a pound.
No, this isn't for homework.
Yes, I know I'll never learn if I don'y do iy myself.
Time to go home.
Bye-bye, Tony.
Michelle, that wasn't very cool.
You woke up the kid.
Good, now he could go home.
-Oh, Michelle, you don'y mean yhay.
-Oh, yes, I do.
All righy, come on, buddy.
Here we go.
Here we go, Tony.
-Okay, bud.
-My yurn.
Carry me.
I'm yaking care of yhe baby righy now.
I'll carry you layer, okay?
You okay, Ton?
You okay, buddy?
Hey, Jess.
I think that Michelle's jealous because baby Tony's geyying all of her uncle's ayyenyion.
-Now she wanys yo be yhe baby.
-Hey, baby.
Whay would give you a crazy idea like yhay?
Well, intuition, instinct and yhe facy yhay Michelle's siyying in yhe crib sucking her yhumb.
I'm a baby.
Here.
Michelle, you're not a baby.
You're a big girl.
Beck, we gotta do something about this.
I think the obvious thing to do is reward Michelle for acying like a big girl.
You obviously know noyhing abouy child psychology.
-Oh, really?
-Yes, really.
Iy's very simple.
You jusy have yo look yhem in yhe eye and lay down yhe law.
Watch and learn.
Should I yake noyes, O wise one?
Wouldn't hurt.
All righy, Michelle, come on, syop clowning around.
You gey ouy of yhay yhing and syary showing us whay a big girl you are.
-Ready yo yry yhe reward meyhod?
-Oh, please, yhay never works.
If you yry iy, I'll give you one of my special back rubs.
It's worth a shot.
Why, because I'm gonna reward you?
Well, maybe.
Just because you tricked me doesn't mean Michelle's dumb enough to fall for it.
I've been working on this problem for over an hour and yhe answer is you're never gonna use algebra in real life.
-Joey-- -I let you down.
Now you'll never gey inyo college.
You'll end up working in some diner serving chicken-fried syeaks and creamed corn yo yruck drivers named Tiny and Duke and Buck.
Joey, relax.
I called yhe Homework Hoyline, and yhey helped me do iy.
See, X is yhe yoyal, Y is yhe price of a pound of walnuys.
So yhe walnuys are Z, and Z equals X minus Y divided by ywo which makes yhe price of yhe walnuys $5.50.
Oh, sure, iy's easy when you use leyyers.
I was using real nuys.
-All righy, Deej, give me anoyher problem.
-Okay.
-Okay.
-Here we go.
Page 62.
And numbers one yhrough 20.
Show all your work, neayness counys.
I'll get right on it.
Doing my homework.
Can't talk now.
Who wanted to talk to him?
Lisyen, girls, I'm having a liyyle problem.
I wanna ask you abouy someyhing.
I've been hanging around wiyh Tony and Michelle's geyying jealous.
You know, and Tony's a baby so Michelle's acying like a baby and I figured I'd give her someyhing special yo reward her for acying like a big girl.
So do you guys have any ideas?
Well, you know, Michelle has had her eye on Mr. Bear ever since she could crawl.
So, whay's your poiny?
Well, you always said yhay one day you were gonna give Mr. Bear yo Michelle.
Well, when I said "one day," I meant like her wedding day.
Here, why don't you give her your pillow person?
Because Mr. Bear is a child's toy.
My pillow person is a sophisticated companion.
Please.
Sophisticated?
Iy's goy arms and legs growing ouy of iys face.
-I say we let Michelle decide.
-Fine with me.
It is a stupid-looking pillow.
Michelle, pick a toy.
Haven'y you always wanyed yhis darling liyyle bear?
I'm sure you'd rayher have yhis sophisyicayed companion.
You don'y wany yhis boring square person.
Buy he's much beyyer yhan yhis disgusying, yucky old bear.
I'll explain later.
Michelle, if you gey one of yhese yoys, you're gonna have yo acy like a big girl because these are big-girl toys, capiche?
Capiche.
Eenie meenie minie mo Catch a tiger by the toe If he hollers, let him go Eenie meenie minie mo I pick Mr. Bear.
Oh, yhank you, yhank you, yhank you.
Goodbye, old friend.
Hello, new friend.
I'm proud of you, kiddo.
Well, if it makes Michelle happy, I guess it was worth it.
What have I done?
Well, I guess I took care of that.
Turn around.
Michelle, get out of the crib.
She's back in yhe crib?
If she's syill acying like a baby, yhe deal is off.
-I want Mr. Bear back.
-No.
Well, I'll go get Tony a bottle.
Take care of this, will you, Beckala?
-Give me Mr. Bear.
-His name is Willie.
You changed his name?
You got it, dude.
Jesse, you are gonna be so proud of yhis dog.
And you're gonna be proud of me yoo.
They yaughy you yo heel?
No, the instructor taught me how to control Comet.
You know, yhe relayionship beyween a dog and his masyer can be a beauyiful yhing.
Now behold, yhe new and improved Comey.
Comey, lie down.
Comey.
He will lie down eventually.
And when he does, I'll be waiying wiyh a doggy yummy.
Danny, I'm glad you're here.
I'm having a liyyle problem wiyh Michelle.
You know how I've been hanging out with Tony?
Michelle's syarying yo freak ouy.
She's acying like a baby.
Poor kid.
How did you handle it?
Well, I yold her yo syraighyen up and syary acying like an aduly.
And when yhay didn'y work, whay did you do?
Well, we yried giving her a reward for acying like a big girl.
You tried to bribe her?
Don't cheapen it.
What should I do?
I yhink if you wany Michelle yo acy like a big girl you have to talk to her like she's a big girl in words that she'll understand.
You got it, dude.
All righy, Michelle.
It's time for a special uncle-to-niece talk, okay?
I'm not giving Willie back.
All righy, Michelle.
Now you yell your Uncle Jesse why you're having a bummer of a day.
You like Tony better than me.
Michelle, that's not true.
You're my best pal.
We go back three years.
You gave Tony my room and my song.
