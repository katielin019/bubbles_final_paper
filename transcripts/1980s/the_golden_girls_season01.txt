{START OF EPISODE 1}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" I taught a class today - the finest school in Dade County.
Two girls had shaved heads and three boys had green hair.
- They're expressing themselves.
- Well, I expressed myself.
I told them they had to leave.
They were too ugly to look at.
Now the parents are mad.
A father came in in a three-piece suit and defended Tiffany, a bald girl with a nose ring.
- What's that?
- Enchiladas rancheros.
Why don't you just shoot me?
- Hi.
- Oh, hi, Rose.
What a day.
One sad person after another.
Rose, you work at grief counseling.
What do you expect, comedians?
Well, it would be a change of pace.
Dorothy, can I borrow your mink stole?
It's Miami in June - only cats are wearing fur.
- You going out?
- No, no.
She's gonna sit here where it's I just need some cucumbers to put on my eyes.
You'll have trouble seeing, Blanche.
It's very good.
It reduces puffiness.
Does it work on thighs?
I don't know, honey.
I don't need it on my thighs.
- Who's she going out with?
- Harry again.
Harry?
Who is this Harry?
All Blanche said was he still has his own teeth and hair.
Oh, it is wonderful dating in Miami.
All the single men under 80 are cocaine smugglers.
- You know, I'd kill to be 20 again.
- Oh, I would kill to be 40 again.
Oh You know, I had the shock of my life today.
I was in the teacher's lounge, talking to a group of girls in their twenties.
Oh, they were so pretty.
At that age, you don't even have to be pretty and you're pretty.
We were laughing and giggling and having a great time and I completely forgot that I was older.
You know, I just felt like one of the girls.
And we had a wonderful time.
And then I got into my car and caught a glimpse of myself, and I almost had a heart attack.
This old woman was in the mirror.
I didn't even recognize her.
Who was it?
- It was me.
- Oh.
Oh, Rose, I'm borrowing your earrings.
Lord, I'd love to get a face-lift by 8:00.
Blanche, who is Harry?
Oh, girls, he's just wonderful.
He's very gallant, he's a perfect gentleman, he's a great dancer.
And he doesn't make noises when he chews.
Chewing - that's way up there on my list.
Comes right after intelligent.
He doesn't talk loud at the movies, doesn't take his own pulse, and he's still interested.
In what?
Rose, if you have to ask, it does not matter anymore.
And he proposed.
Blanche, wait a minute!
He proposed?
You've only known him a week!
- And he wants an answer tonight.
- Tonight?
Ton What are you gonna tell him?
I don't know.
He's very wonderful, but I have only known him for a week.
- That's right.
- But I don't want to lose him.
Girls, I just don't know what I'm gonna tell him.
I have to go put on my face.
What if she marries him?
What'll happen to us?
- This house is hers.
- Then we'll move.
We can't afford to buy a house.
What do we have for collateral?
A gay cook?
Oh, come on, Rose.
Nobody is getting married.
- Now, let's go talk to Blanche.
- Dorothy, we'll become bag ladies!
- Blanche?
- Come in.
Blanche, Blanche, your friend Harry wants an answer tonight.
What are you gonna tell him?
I haven't decided.
I guess I'll know when I hear it come out of my mouth.
You'll know when you hear it come out of your mouth?
This isn't a belch, Blanche.
This is marriage!
Will you look at this?
She has more colors than Benjamin Moore Paints.
You mustn't rush into anything, Blanche.
You hardly know him.
I just wonder what my husband George would think about me and Harry.
Well, if he was alive, he probably would not like it.
But since he's dead, I don't think it poses a problem.
I just want him to know that I'm happy, but that I could never be as happy with Harry in the same way as I was with him.
He knows, Blanche.
He knows.
Your thoughts and feelings go right to him.
You can communicate directly from your heart.
Can't you, Dorothy?
Oh, don't ask me.
I can't get through to New Jersey with MCI.
That's him.
He's early.
I haven't finished my face.
The only thing left is to dip it in bronze.
We'll get it.
Thanks.
- I wonder what he looks like.
- I hope he doesn't have hair in his ears.
- Hi there.
- Ma!
- Ma, what's the matter?
- Everyone is fine.
No one died.
- The home burned down.
- My God, are you all right?
- How'd you get here?
- I hitched.
- Oh, Ma!
- A cab.
I took a cab.
Well, you should've called.
I'm perfectly capable of managing by myself.
I don't need help.
- I'm a totally independent person.
- I know, I know.
I need $67 for the cab.
$67?
Ma, Ma, this is crazy.
The home is 15 minutes from here.
My cab driver is Cuban.
He said there was an additional tax for a bilingual driver.
I'll take care of him.
Sit down, Sophia.
You must be exhausted.
Why?
I rode in the cab.
I didn't push it.
Oh, Sophia, honey!
How nice to see you.
- Who are you?
- It's me, Blanche.
You look like a prostitute.
Sophia, the things you say!
She didn't mean that, Blanche.
Of course I mean it.
Look at her.
My cab driver would fall in love.
Can I get something to eat, or is the fancy man in the kitchen?
- The way she talks!
- She can't help it.
Oh, I've known plenty of women who have had strokes.
Some of them were in very bad shape, but they're still ladies.
But this stroke destroyed the part of her brain that censors what she says.
She just says whatever she thinks.
She can't help it.
He's an OK petunia.
Ma, Ma, the cab driver said you promised him a $67 tip!
Don't be silly.
I said a six, seven dollar tip.
Why don't these people learn English if they're gonna live here?
This is Miami.
I'd have less trouble getting around Ecuador.
- (doorbell - Oh, I'll get it.
- Harry, hi!
- Ah, my pretty.
Oh, Harry.
Everybody, this is Harry.
- Harry, this is Rose.
- Rose.
- And Dorothy.
- Dorothy.
- Hi, Harry.
- And this is Sophia.
Well, you must be Blanche's sister.
You must be blind.
- Sophia's home just burned down.
- Oh, that's terrible!
Not to me.
It was a retirement home, and you know what they did?
They set off the fire alarm in a retirement home.
Who can rush?
Half the people have walkers, the other half can't get out of their chairs.
But they got bells going off like crazy.
You know what that does to hearts that only beat a few times a week?
It's not pretty.
Uh, we'd better go.
We have reservations.
I hope he's taking you to a cold climate.
Good night.
Thanks, ladies.
It was a pleasure.
Nice meeting you, Harry.
Have fun!
The man is a scuzzball.
This is so sad.
We were all so lonely and then by a miracle we found each other.
Rose, we both answered an ad to share Blanche's house that we found in the supermarket.
It was not the resurrection.
It is hardly a miracle.
To me it was a miracle because we're happy.
It's not fair, you know.
I mean, we get married, we have kids, the kids leave, and our husbands die.
Is that some kind of a test?
You don't work that hard, you don't go through everything you go through to be left alone.
We are alone, Dorothy, we really are.
Our families are gone and we're alone.
And there are too many years left, and I don't know what to do.
Get a poodle.
It's yes.
I know it is.
She's gonna marry him.
Oh, come on, Rose.
She can't help it.
Blanche needs a man.
She told me, when George died, she made a date at the funeral.
Oh, not that she didn't love George.
She can't be without a man.
You know what I'm saying?
What am I doing up?
I'm subbing for a teacher who was shot by a student.
I need all the sleep I can get.
I used to sleep so well.
I never even turned over.
I'd wake up with a perfect hairdo.
Charlie, on the other hand, moves all night long.
His side of the bed looks like a murder took place.
- Rose, Charlie is dead.
- Why tell her?
Coco, it's 15 years!
I know he's dead.
I'm not crazy.
I just like to talk about him in the present tense sometimes.
- It makes him seem closer.
- That's fine, Rose.
You do that.
- I don't mind at all.
- Sure, Rose.
Set a place at the table.
- Well, hi!
- What happened?
Oh, we had the nicest time.
We went to Joe's.
You ever been to Joe's?
- Yes.
What happened?
- I had the stone crabs.
I never had stone crabs.
You ever have stone crabs?
Yes, Blanche.
Just tell us.
I was just so relieved they didn't have eyes.
I can't eat anything with eyes, like lobster.
- I can't eat anything that moves.
- Like what, Rose?
Horses?
- Like oysters.
- Oysters don't move!
Coco, they could dance!
Who cares?
- Tell us.
- Oysters move!
Very slowly.
You have to watch very closely.
- Blanche, are you gonna marry Harry?
- Marry Harry, marry Harry.
- A little rhyme.
- Knock it off.
Are you?
Yes.
Next week.
I knew it.
I knew she was gonna marry him.
But next week?
At our age, long engagements don't make sense.
I have to go to bed.
- Where will you live?
- Well, here.
- Where will we live?
- Oh, don't worry.
We'll live, we'll live.
Oh, I hadn't thought of that.
It's so hard to find a place to live.
- Well, you can just stay right here.
- Well, that's settled.
Oh, Rose!
How could we stay here with Blanche and Harry?
- She just said!
- You certainly can until you find a place.
However long that takes.
We're going to New York for the honeymoon.
I just hope I don't get murdered.
Charlie and I waited two whole years before we got married.
I got married before my father finished the sentence.
You married your father?
My father told Stan that he had to marry me.
I was pregnant.
You had a blowgun wedding?
If you live in the Amazon.
In Queens, it's called "shotgun.
" Maybe that's why he left - because you forced him into it.
Rose, he left me 38 years later.
For a stewardess that he met on a business trip to Hawaii.
It was her first flight.
They said, "On arrival, give the passengers a lei.
" She got confused He got lucky, and they now live on Maui.
It's really wonderful.
A 65-year-old man with gout learning to windsurf.
I hope he trips on his thongs and falls into a volcano.
- Oh, it's you.
- Oh, Sophia, did we wake you?
I heard noise.
I thought it was robbers, so I hid my jewels.
Now I can't remember where.
Ma, you don't have any jewels.
Thank God, because I can't find them.
Tea, Sophia?
How about a shot of gin with a beer back?
That was dumb of me to have tea this late.
I'll go to sleep and have to get up to go.
And wake me up.
You know, if you didn't drink before bedtime, you wouldn't have to wake up in the middle of the night.
I don't drink before bedtime.
I stop all liquids at noon and I still wake up.
I never have that problem - never.
I sleep like a log.
I never get up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom.
I go in the morning.
Every morning like clockwork.
At 7 am, I pee.
Unfortunately, I don't wake up till 8:00.
- Where's Blanche?
- In the bathroom.
- I've gotta talk to you.
- What is it?
I know this sounds crazy, but I'm suspicious.
- Of what?
- Harry.
- Harry?
- And I don't know why.
There's just something about it I don't like, and I have to tell Blanche.
- Tell Blanche what?
- That she can't marry him!
The wedding is in 12 minutes!
You can't tell her that.
I owe it to her.
I'm her friend.
But there's nothing to tell her.
This is just some crazy hunch.
My hunches are never wrong.
Mrs. Gandhi would be alive today if she had taken my call.
- I'm gonna tell her.
- You are not.
- I will not let you.
- I can't stop crying.
I'm so happy and so sad.
Kind of a happy sad.
- Speaking of sad, Blanche - Shut up, Rose.
She's crying already.
What's the difference?
Rose, pick that up.
I just can't believe it.
I'm getting married!
- What do you think about that?
- I think it's a mistake.
To wear all that makeup.
I know it's fast, but I just don't know when I'll find another like him.
He just Oh, girls, girls, he makes me feel so good, so young, so happy.
Aw.
Rose, did you hear that?
So happy.
Now I have to go to the bathroom again.
When I get nervous, I have to go all the time.
That's why I'm getting married here at the house.
Public bathrooms are so difficult for me.
I wash my hands so thoroughly, and then I find it so hard to get out again without touching the doorknob.
- Don't!
- Be too long!
Rose, that is a happy woman in there.
Now, I want you to promise that you will not say anything.
Do you promise?
Are you sure?
Well, what's got me so sad Ohh Oh, I just I just never, never had two better friends.
I just can't stand the thought of leaving you.
- Oh, Blanche, you look gorgeous.
- Oh!
Shut up, Rose.
- Are you ready?
- Yes, I guess.
Stop!
(thud - The minister's here.
- Oh, I need perfume.
Perfume, perfume.
Come on, let's go.
- He's a half-hour late.
- He probably got caught in traffic.
Ladies, I'm on a tight schedule.
This is Miami.
I've got funerals backed up.
Give us a few minutes, please.
Five minutes more, then I've got to bury Mr. Pinkus.
- (doorbell - You see?
- Is there a Blanche Hollingsworth here?
- God, he's been killed.
- Arrested.
- What?
He gave me this to give to you.
He's a bigamist, ma'am.
He's wanted in four states.
He's got six wives.
You got yourself mixed up with a real hustler.
I'm sorry.
Well, you won't be needing me today.
Blanche, do you want to read the note?
Do you want me to read it to you?
"Dear Blanche, I guess you know by now.
"I'm really sorry.
"The thing is, I really liked you.
"This time was different.
You're a special lady.
Maybe someday you'll write to me.
Harry.
" Oh, God.
I'm stunned.
I'm just stunned.
I know.
Oh, I feel like such an old fool.
Not just a fool, but an old fool.
My God, I just wanna die.
You're not a fool, Blanche.
You're a beautiful, loving, trusting woman.
There's no fool here, Blanche.
I guess maybe I'm hoping the shock will be too much for my heart and I'll just drop dead right here.
And the minister can bury me with Mr. Pinkus.
I won't have to look anyone in the eye ever again.
Except maybe Mr. Pinkus.
If I meet our paperboy, he will not live to be a paper man.
Florida is having a drought.
In the entire state, there is not enough water to make a cup of tea.
He finds a puddle.
What are you doing?
She's sleeping.
Just checking.
You never know.
Tell me, how is Blanche?
She didn't go to work again today.
It's been three weeks and she just sits in her room.
The museum's gonna fire her.
Well, we've tried everything - golf, the movies, theater tickets.
She wouldn't even budge for Julio Iglesias.
I know grief.
It takes time.
Please, Rose.
Listen, if you're Irish, you have a wake.
You eat, you cry, you drink, you vomit, and you're done.
If you're Jewish, you cry, you sit, you eat for seven days, you put on ten pounds, and it's over.
We Italians scream, dress up a donkey, hire a band, and that's that.
It's these southern Protestants who make it a way of life.
When I go, put me in a steel sack and leave me on the curb next to the cans.
- We thought you were asleep.
- You never know.
You girls shouldn't sit out here in the sun.
- We've been so worried about you.
- I know.
- I'm so glad you're up.
- I'm sorry if I worried you.
- Aw, sweetheart, how are you?
- I'm OK.
I really am.
No.
At first I wanted to give up, to die, truly.
Only time I ever felt worse was when George died.
But then I had the kids with me and I pulled through it.
This time, I thought, "This is my last chance, my last hope for happiness.
" - I just thought I'd never feel good again.
- How long is this story?
I'm 80.
I have to plan.
This morning I woke up and I was in the shower, shampooing my hair, and I heard humming.
I thought there was someone in there with me.
No, it was me.
I was humming.
And humming means I'm feeling good.
And then I realized I was feeling good because of you.
You made the difference.
You're my family, and you make me happy to be alive.
- Let's drive to Coconut Grove for lunch.
- OK.
My treat.
We have to celebrate.
What, that she came out of her room?
That we're together.
And that no matter what happens, even if we all get married, we'll stick together.
Then we'll need a much bigger house.
Sure, Rose.
After lunch, you can pick up the lumber.
- Ma, you want to join us?
- Nope.
- I gotta rest.
I got a date tonight.
- Huh?
With whom?
The fancy man and I are going to the dog track.
- Your mother bets?
- No, she rides.
She's a dog jockey.
Let's go.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say Thank you for being a friend Oh, great, great, wonderful!
My daughter is lost!
I'm just terrible at giving directions!
- I gave Kate the directions over the phone.
- And who are you, Rand McNally?
You couldn't make a mistake?
Shall I set this down someplace?
No, Rose, go to the corner and open a stand!
- Dorothy - I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
It's just that I'm so anxious about meeting this guy that Kate's bringing.
Do you think it's serious?
Well, they've been together now for six months.
That's the longest she's been interested in any man since Paul McCartney.
Kate dated Paul McCartney?
Yes, Rose.
They wanted to get engaged, but I insisted that she finish grade school.
Do you know anything about this boy's family background?
- All I know is that he's a doctor.
- A doctor!
The heck with his background!
Do you have any idea how much a doctor makes these days?
No, I really don't care what he does for a living.
I mean, the important thing is that he and Kate have a good relationship.
(doorbell 'Course if they happen to get married, I will shout from every rooftop in Miami, "My son-in-law's a doctor"!
- Hi, Mom!
- Oh, baby!
Oh, it is so good to see you!
Oh, look everybody, look who's here!
- You look glorious!
- Where is he?
Where's your doctor?
Dennis is at a seminar.
I'll bring him by tomorrow.
- I can't find my culottes!
- Grandma, you look sensational!
Relax, relax, you're already in the will!
Before anyone does anything, I have a big announcement to make.
As my mother has undoubtedly already told you and the rest of Miami, for the past six months, I've been seeing a doctor named Dennis.
That's your big announcement?
You call your doctor by his first name?
Ma, Ma, he's her boyfriend.
He just happens to be a doctor, OK?
Fine!
What's the point?
The day after tomorrow, Dennis and I are flying to the Bahamas - and we're getting married.
- Oh, that's terrific!
- Oh!
That's so exciting!
- Oh, I can't, I can't believe it!
Oh, I am so happy!
My daughter is marrying a doctor!
In the Bahamas.
- You are getting married in the Bahamas?
- This is fabulous.
I always wanted to go to the Bahamas!
Now where the hell are my culottes?
Oh, Kate, Kate, honey, I have always dreamed of giving you a wedding!
Ever since I had your overbite fixed.
Don't you think it would be awkward, with you and Dad not talking?
Now just a minute!
I am not the one who ran off to Maui with someone half my age and twice my bra size!
You see what I mean?
That's why we're getting married in the Bahamas.
You are not getting married on an island by a priest wearing clam diggers You'll get married right here in Miami.
Kate, I could put together a lovely reception here at the house.
And I could take care of the catering!
I have always dreamed of wearing a long, white gown and marching down the aisle on my father's arm.
Who said anything about inviting your father?
It wouldn't be much of a wedding without both of my parents there.
Even if we got live doves?
- Mother!
- Oh, all right, honey.
Your wedding day should be the most beautiful day of your life.
And if you want to invite your father, I'm willing to keep the peace.
- Promise?
- Promise.
Then it's settled.
Now call your father and tell the dirt bag he can come.
Forget it, Mom.
I can just as easily limbo down the aisle.
Relax honey.
I just want to get it all out of my system before he gets here.
- Now go ahead, call him.
- I'll call him.
You talk to him.
All right.
If I can get through an entire wedding with him, I should be able to handle a simple phone conversation with that yellow-bellied sleazeball!
Hello, Stan?
Dorothy Dorothy Zbornak The one who gave you the best years of her thighs.
Yes, I'm fine, fine Yeah, it has been a long time.
Yeah, well, you know, after two years, I figured you weren't coming back.
I'll tell you the reason I'm calling you - Kate is getting married.
Yes, married Yes, yes, in a few days, and I'm giving her a little wedding here in Miami and I wanted to invite you.
Can you come?
You can?
Great.
Oh, Chrissy can't, oh Oh, I'm so sorry Oh, really?
No, I didn't know that could happen from a tanning machine.
Oh, she'll be thrilled to see you too!
She's standing right here.
Hold on.
- Dorothy, you were magnificent!
- You certainly were!
How did you do it?
I just kept telling myself that once he was here, he'd be close enough to kill.
I can't believe Stan has the nerve to show his face at this wedding!
The man has a right to see his daughter get married!
- I never should have called him.
- You never should have married him!
- Hi, hi, hi!
- Oh, hi, Blanche.
Are my little wedding elves still busy packing their tiny bundles?
Wedding elves.
It's that cheap hair dye she uses.
It finally ate through!
- No, we're doing fine, Blanche.
- Oh, no, honey!
- You're using too much rice!
- Fine!
This elf quits!
I never understood why people throw rice at weddings anyway.
Because tomatoes leave stains.
Could I talk to you two ladies in the living room, please?
I have some very distressing news.
Sophia's been pilfering cheese balls.
What?
This morning, I made 48 cheese balls.
There are now 26.
Hi, Mom!
Mom, this is Don't tell me!
Don't tell me!
It's Dennis!
Oh, my God, he's beautiful!
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Oh, flowers!
Oh, my!
You know, your father used to bring me tulips every time we had a fight.
Toward the end, our place looked like Easter in Rotterdam.
It's good to see that you're not bitter.
Everybody, I'd like you to meet my future son-in-law.
This is Dennis, the gorgeous doctor!
Dennis, I'd like you to meet my best friends.
This is Rose.
- Hello, Rose.
- That's Blanche.
How do you do?
And that's Sophia.
That's Kate's grandma.
You got your stethoscope?
I wouldn't mind a freebie!
Grandma, Dennis doesn't have a stethoscope.
Of course not.
He's on vacation!
That's not what I mean - Dennis is a podiatrist.
Oh, oh, a foot doctor.
Ah, why don't we all sit down.
- Not there, not there.
- Oh Well, a podiatrist.
Well, that's a very fascinating profession.
Tell me, Dennis, approximately how many feet do you see in a week?
Between my partners and me, we see quite a few.
- Oh, it's a partnership.
- Have you ever met Dr. Scholl?
Let's get to the point!
What do you take home a week?
Ma!
It's all right, I understand.
Sophia, I am crazy about Kate and I promise you she will never want for anything.
Oh!
I told you he was special.
Do you think Dad'll like him?
Of course!
As long as he stays young and firm.
Oh, Dennis, it's going to be a pleasure welcoming you into our little family!
And I just hope that you and Kate have all the happiness in the world!
Me too.
And maybe one of your children will be a real doctor!
(doorbell Hi, it was really (doorbell Dorothy, it's Stan.
Didn't you recognize me?
Of course I recognized you.
That's why I slammed the door in your face.
- Still the jokester, huh?
- Yes.
And speaking of jokes, Stan, that is some toupee you've got.
- Oh.
- Oh, Rose.
I'd like you to meet my ex-husband, Stan Zbornak.
- Hello.
- And this is his hair.
It's a pleasure to meet you both.
Hello.
Who invited Donny Osmond?
- Ma, this is Stan.
- Hello, Sophia.
It's the hair.
It makes me look different.
- It makes you look stupid.
- Oh, hello there.
Stan, I'd like you to meet my friend Blanche.
Charmed.
- Daddy?
- Oh.
- Oh.
- Hello, princess!
- Oh, you look absolutely beautiful!
- I'm so glad you're here!
- Thank you for coming.
- Don't thank me.
Thank your mother.
There aren't too many women around who could swallow their pride after what went down between us.
You're awesome, babe.
Absolutely awesome.
Shh!
We better get to the church.
Don't you think so?
- Yeah.
- Uh Grandma, why don't you come with me and Daddy.
Come on, Sophia.
It'll be fun.
We can catch up with old times.
No, we can't.
I had a stroke.
Luckily, my memories of you were wiped out!
- See ya.
- Bye.
Dorothy, are you all right?
Oh, she's a trouper.
She'll be fine.
Won't you, Dorothy?
Not until I taste his blood!
Now, you don't mean that.
I want you to take a deep breath and think pleasant thoughts.
Come on, now.
One, two, three.
I'm not going!
Dorothy!
Your daughter's getting married!
I cannot be in the same room with him!
I know I'll do something crazy and just ruin the whole wedding!
Blanche and I'll be right beside you.
Nothing can happen.
- I cannot do it!
- All right!
I've heard enough!
We are talking about your daughter's wedding, Dorothy Zbornak!
Now you get on your feet, get out that door!
March!
Oh, all right.
All right, I'm going.
But if anything awful happens, it's on your heads!
Oh, she's really upset.
We better keep an eye on her.
You're right.
We better stick to her like a tight shirt on a sweaty farmhand!
You know the type, with the big biceps and the hairy chest, just glistening in the hot sun I'm sorry, what were we talking about?
- Dorothy.
- Oh, Dorothy!
Oh, that's right!
I'm not saying this because she is my daughter, but she was the best Abraham Lincoln the third grade ever saw.
No, when she freed the second grade, there was not a dry eye in the house.
Somehow I just can't picture Kate as Abraham Lincoln.
Oh, Stan, do me a favor?
Take off your hair and hold it up to Kate's chin.
- Mother, you promised!
- I know, I know.
Just ignore me, Stan.
It should be easy.
You've had plenty of practice.
Princess, before I forget, I want to invite you and Dennis to come spend some time with Chrissy and me in our new house in Maui.
- That sounds great!
- Yeah, yeah, it's primo!
Listen, I have some pictures.
Take a look at that stretch of beach, huh?
That's our house.
That's Chrissy on a new Hobie Cat.
That's Chrissy in a hot tub.
That's me and Chrissy at a luau.
Is she the one with the apple in her mouth?
Ma!
You know, she looks pretty good for being in the ground for two hours.
- Rose, Rose, what are you doing?
- Watching the cheese balls.
- You're supposed to be watching Dorothy!
- I was watching Dorothy!
But every time I watch her, Sophia eats a cheese ball.
Honey, let her have the darn cheese balls.
Nobody else wants them!
- Cheese ball, Father?
- Oh, yes, thank you very much.
Now I know what I'm giving up for Lent!
Stanley, would you be a dear and get me some champagne?
It's always a pleasure to get a drink for an attractive woman.
I'll get one for you too, Dorothy.
Would you excuse us?
Have you ever met a man who knows how to push all your buttons?
Just once.
He was a cabana boy in Pensacola.
I am never going to get through this.
I just hate him too much.
- I know I'm gonna do something crazy!
- You just simmer down, missy.
Sit down here.
I want to talk to you, Dorothy.
Listen, I know this isn't easy for you, so I'm gonna let you in on a sorority secret that was passed on to me at Miss MacGyver's Finishing School.
Now, whenever you feel you're about to lose control, just take my hand and give it a little squeeze.
I guarantee you'll feel 100% better.
And that's the big secret?
Oh, no!
The big secret was that Miss MacGyver and Miss McKinney were sharing a one-bedroom apartment off campus.
Oh, will you Here you go, ladies.
Dorothy, would you like some hors d'oeuvres?
- No, thank you, Stan.
- Blanche, would you care for something?
Doesn't look like you're fighting the battle of the bulge.
Oh, ow, ow.
No, thank you, Stan.
Well, then, I'd like to make a toast.
Your attention please, everybody.
To my son-in-law and my daughter - may she be as happy with her new life mate as I am with mine.
Hear, hear!
Blanche, don't you think it's time we cut the cake?
Oh, yes, I do, Rose!
Who invited the priest?
You know I can't cut loose with a priest around.
Sophia, he happens to be a very nice man.
He gives me the creeps.
He's been following me.
They always follow the old people.
It's like parking tickets.
They got a last rites quota.
Sophia, there you are.
I've been looking all over for you.
Buzz off, Padre.
- Rose, where's Dorothy?
- I don't know.
She was here a minute ago.
- Uh-oh.
- Oh, my God!
- Give me that knife!
- What are you doing?
I can't let you go through with this!
Do you want to spend the rest of your life rotting away in some disgusting jail cell, bribing screws for cigarettes and toilet paper?
Rose, in Miami, it is not a felony to cut the wedding cake!
Cut the wedd Oh, I thought you were gonna stab Stan.
Don't be ridiculous!
Do you honestly believe I would stab Stan at my own daughter's wedding?
- Oh, no, I guess not.
- Well, of course not!
I would wait until after the wedding.
There are too many witnesses.
No, no!
- Kidding - Oh, don't do that to me!
- What are you doing?
- I just want to be by myself for awhile.
- It's time to throw rice at the kids.
- I don't think I can go back out there.
- You're acting like a jerk.
- Thanks, Ma.
Thanks.
That really makes me feel a lot better.
Don't get smart with your mother!
Listen, Dorothy, I love you dearly, but you're not the first woman to be dumped by her husband.
Oh, Ma, Ma, it's not what he did.
I mean, I've learned to live with that.
It's the way he did it.
The least he could have done was tell me to my face.
If you're so angry with him, tell him.
You don't have to kill him.
I know.
But I want to.
Dorothy, anger is a lot like a piece of shredded wheat caught under your dentures.
If you leave it there, you get a blister and you gotta eat Jell-O all week.
If you get rid of it, the sore heals, and you feel better.
Anger is like a piece of shredded wheat?
You want poetry, you listen to Neil Diamond.
You want good advice?
You listen to your mother.
Maybe you're right.
Of course I'm right.
You think I got this old by being stupid?
You know, you're the greatest mother in the world.
Tell me something I don't know.
(overlapping chatter Well, Mother, I guess this is it.
Goodbye, sweetheart!
Now listen, you be a good wife, you hear?
Be his friend, be his lover.
Don't be his slave.
Mom, Mom, we'll talk when I get back.
Thank you for everything.
- I love you.
- Oh, I love you too.
And I love you too, Dennis!
Goodbye, Dorothy.
Listen, don't take any guff from her, you hear?
But take good care of her.
Because if you don't, I'll kill you, you know that.
Oh, OK, everybody out!
Goodbye, out!
Goodbye!
- Bye!
- Be happy!
Be happy!
I really Dorothy, it was great.
Thanks for the hospitality.
- Sophia, girls, take care.
- Oh, Stan, just a minute.
I'd like to talk to you.
Well, sure, OK.
Let's go where we can have some privacy.
Have a seat.
What can I do for you?
The first thing you can do is get rid of that ridiculous toupee.
I want to speak to the bald guy who left me.
Ow!
What's the matter with you?
- You walked out on me, Stanley Zbornak!
- Now I know why.
You walked out on me and you didn't have the decency to tell me you were leaving.
I heard it from some lawyer over the telephone.
A stranger, Stanley, a total stranger, told me that my marriage was over.
- Dorothy, look, things happened.
- Things happened?
You're damn right things happened.
and dreaming and fighting and loving and children and diapers and school plays and Little League.
And worrying if you'd get through your gallbladder surgery.
And wondering if I'd get through another Sunday dinner at your mother's house.
And the lean years, when the business failed.
And the good years, and the happy Christmases.
All those things happened.
And because they happened, I deserved better than a stinking phone call from my husband's legal representative.
You had a choice and you took the easy way out.
And it was a rotten thing to do!
But now you're here in front of me and you can't run away.
And I finally get to have what you tried to cheat me out of.
I finally get to say goodbye, Stanley.
- Look, Dorothy, we - I said goodbye, Stanley.
Honey, we just saw Stanley leaving.
Are you all right?
- I'm fine.
- I wouldn't be fine!
I don't know what I'd have done if Charlie had suddenly paid a visit!
He's dead!
You would have fainted!
Are you Are you really all right?
I'm feeling a little better.
And tomorrow you're gonna feel a lot better.
And the next day, maybe better still.
- And the next day, maybe - That's right, Dorothy.
And then one day, Stanley's gonna be out of your life completely.
Not completely.
There will always be a little part of him that stays with me.
Of course, Dorothy.
After 38 years, there are always bound to be - some memories that stay with you.
- I wasn't talking about memories.
I was talking about this.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say Thank you for being a friend Discard already!
I'm 80- I'd like to live long enough to see the next hand!
No need to, Ma.
Gin.
You're taking advantage.
You know I'm whacked out on blood pressure medicine.
Honey, if the medicine bothers you, change the prescription.
I like being whacked out.
Oh, I'm so glad you're here!
My date's brother just came into town and unless I can find a date for him so we can double, the whole evening's gonna be called off.
So what do you say?
Would you please be a friend and go out with him?
Sure, I'm game!
Next time, Sophia.
Dorothy, what do you say?
Oh, honey, I'd really love to go.
But as you can see, I'm busy.
Busy?
You're playing cards!
We are not playing cards, we are playing gin rummy.
And she stinks at it!
We've been doing it for 30 years - she hasn't beaten me once!
Tonight's going to be different.
Tonight, the 30 years of humiliation ends!
Ooh, I'm so scared, my dentures are chattering.
- Hi!
- Oh, Rose, honey, are you up for a night on the town with two handsome, eligible bachelors?
Thanks for asking, but I don't think so.
I'm not that interested in dating anymore.
Now you know that's not true, honey, or you'd let your hair go natural.
You know what my problem really is?
I'm spoiled.
I had a long and wonderful marriage with a perfect man.
Everyone seems so ordinary after Charlie.
Honey, it's just for dinner, and Charles would want you to eat.
Oh, Rose, be a friend.
If you don't go, I can't go.
I know I'm gonna regret this and I know I'm gonna have a miserable time, - but I'll go.
- Aw, that's the spirit!
I'll go call the boys.
Rose, why do you look so depressed?
I'm tired of going out and not enjoying myself.
All the men I meet act so old.
Last week, I went out with this man that talked for two hours about his prostate problems.
I lived in Minnesota for 51 years - I never even heard of a prostate.
Honey, they don't have them there.
It's too cold.
Dorothy, you should be going on this date.
At least you'd have some fun.
Nothing could be more fun than beating my mother at cards tonight.
- What's the name of the game?
- Gin!
Gin!
Dorothy?
What's the matter?
Something wrong?
The thrill of victory!
The agony of defeat!
I don't know why you play cards with your mother.
It just makes you crazy.
You're absolutely right, Blanche!
This has gone on far too long!
Mom, I am not playing gin with you anymore!
You'll be back.
You know why?
You're too competitive!
It's always been your worst feature.
Actually, your ears are your worst feature.
But competitive is right up there!
Do you believe that?
No.
I always thought your bony feet were your worst feature.
- Nighty-night!
- Wait!
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute, you haven't told me about the double date!
It was a complete disaster.
You mean Rose and her guy didn't hit it off?
Oh no, they got along just great.
It was my escort who turned out to be the dud.
Next time, I'm gonna date both brothers before I give one away.
- Hi!
- Hi!
I hear you had a great time tonight.
It was the best!
I haven't laughed so much or acted so silly since I was a teenager.
- You know what we did?
- What?
- We ran a tollbooth!
- Oh Arnie said he just did it because it was there!
Oh, he is the most outrageous, unpredictable man I have ever met!
Jeffrey's on a low-sodium diet.
I can't remember when I had so much fun!
We went dancing at The Beachcomber.
We're gonna go back again tomorrow night.
Jeffrey doesn't dance.
He says it makes his ankles swell.
Honey, I think it's terrific that you had a good time tonight.
I have you two to thank for it.
Goodnight!
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight!
Blanche, come on now!
Be happy for her!
She finally met someone.
I mean, you go out with lots of interesting guys!
Name one.
How about that coach from the Miami Dolphins?
Oh, yeah.
That night was kind of fun.
The training room, the whirlpool, the adhesive tape Name another one.
Honey, take a cold shower and go to bed.
Dorothy, would you please open this jar of macadamia nuts for me?
- You can't get it open?
- Oh, I didn't try.
- I don't want to risk cracking a nail.
- What are these, claws?
I figured you wouldn't mind, seeing as how you work with your hands all day.
I'm a teacher - I grade papers.
I don't shuck oysters!
Thank you.
I'm going next door to Frieda Goodson's.
We're having a club meeting.
I didn't know you were in a club.
A bunch of us get together and send our pictures in to Willard Scott with a note saying we're 100.
Ma, that's ridiculous!
You got a better way to get on The Today Show?
Will you take it inside, Rose?
This isn't the French Quarter!
- You'll think about next week, Rose?
- I will, Arnie.
Talk to you soon.
Well, it looks like you and Arnie are getting pretty serious.
- Honey, are you all right?
- I'll be fine.
Is this about Arnie?
No, Blanche, she's upset because they keep changing the taste of Coke.
Arnie wants me to go away with him on a cruise to the Bahamas.
Oh, and you're upset because he wants you to pay your own way?
I'm upset because we'll be all alone.
In the middle of the ocean.
On a ship.
In a state room.
With a bed.
Oh.
I don't know what to do.
I haven't been with a man in that special way since Charlie died.
Get out of here!
It's true!
Charlie was the only lover I ever had.
And my first time was on our wedding night.
Get out of here!
Oh, back off, Blanche!
Not all of us are classified by the Navy as a friendly port!
Maybe it sounds strange, but without Charlie, I thought that part of my life was over.
I never gave it a second thought.
Until now?
Then I think you should go on the cruise.
Honey, if the situation is right, you'll know it.
But I'm not sure I'm ready.
Oh, honey, I know what you're going through.
The bottom line is, if you take a chance in life, sometimes good things happen, sometimes bad things happen.
But honey, if you don't take a chance, nothing happens.
I'm gonna take a chance.
- Oh, that's wonderful!
- Oh, great, Rose!
Oh, I have to look in my closet.
I don't even know what to wear the first night on the ship!
A life jacket and a great big smile!
- You startled me!
- Oh, I'm sorry.
Next time I'II I'll knock.
I like your bathrobe.
Yeah.
Kids gave it to me for Father's Day.
I wish I had that knack.
Picking out unusual gifts.
- Is it, um, is it terry cloth?
- Yeah, I think it is.
Terry cloth wears a long time.
It's a nice fabric.
- Yes, perfect for a robe.
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, I guess it's time to turn in.
- I guess.
Oh, you're not tired?
- Not really.
- Me neither.
Do you feel like dancing?
Oh, I'd love to.
I can be dressed and back in that ballroom in ten minutes!
No, no, Rose!
We don't have to go through all that trouble.
See, I bought this for my grandson - sounded so good, I kept it for myself.
- Oh, I love Glenn Miller!
- Come on.
I met my husband at a Glenn Miller dance.
It wasn't really the Glenn Miller Orchestra - it was Dick Singleton and The Singletones.
Their motto was: if you close your eyes, you think it's Glenn Miller.
Believe me, no matter what you did, you knew it was Dick Singleton.
Rose, Rose, you're one of a kind.
That's what my husband used to say.
You know, in a lot of ways, you remind me of Charlie.
The way you laugh.
The way you dance.
Even the way Rose, I'm not Charlie.
I'm Arnie Peterson from Plainfield, New Jersey.
If you like me, it's for who I am, not for who I remind you of.
I do like you, Arnie Peterson.
I like you too, Rose Nyland.
- Oh, you can't sleep either, huh?
- No.
Want some tea?
Oh, please.
Watch what you're grabbing.
I got a specimen in there.
Gee, I wonder what Rose is doing right now.
You mean, you wonder if she's doing it right now.
No, I just wonder if maybe we didn't push her into something too fast.
What I can't understand is how in the world she managed to wait 15 years.
How long did you wait after George died?
- 'Till the paramedics came.
- Ma!
As the reverend was performing the funeral service, - I knew for sure that he wanted me.
- Oh I'd always known that there'd been something between us.
Sometimes from the pulpit, he'd be talking about sin and he'd look straight at me.
We couldn't do anything about it because he was married.
But after his wife died, there was no stopping him.
So?
Well, we could finally consummate our long and burning passion.
And?
It took about ten minutes.
He wore his watch and his socks.
I never saw him again.
Your father didn't even take off his pants!
Ma!
What about you, Dorothy?
Who was the first after Stan, hmm?
- Blanche.
- Her divorce lawyer.
- How did you know?
- It's always the divorce lawyer.
Oh, it was a terrible time for me.
You know, I'd gone on an eating binge when Stan left and I put on quite a bit of weight.
Plus, I was not a 20-year-old.
You know, when you're 20, no matter what you do, everything stays where it's supposed to.
Now, when you lean over, it looks like somebody's let the air out of your face.
What?
Honey, lean over a mirror some time and take a look at yourself.
- Where's a mirror?
- There's one in the tool drawer.
I think you'd better take a sedative before you look.
Don't be silly.
I look at my face all the time.
How different could it be leaning over?
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, Dorothy, why didn't you tell me about this before?
Only on your back, Blanche.
That way everything slides back and you look like you just had a face lift.
Oh, you're right.
I'm gorgeous.
I'm gonna have to meet men lying down.
I thought you did.
Of course that way, not only does your face fall back, but your chest does too.
Unfortunately, it falls back and off to the side.
Rose, Rose, are you still in there?
This is crazy!
Look, I talked to the purser.
Another cabin is available and I'll move to it.
But I need to get in the bathroom, Rose.
I hate to go anywhere without my Actifed.
Good morning.
I can't let you see my eyes.
They look terrible from crying.
Rose, you couldn't possibly look terrible to me.
I left my contact lenses in the bathroom.
I'm sorry.
I am so sorry.
Yeah, it can be awkward.
I thought I could do it, I really did.
And then I couldn't.
You see, it would have been the first time since my husband died.
I figured it was the first time.
It's been 15 years since he died, huh?
Boy, he must have been something.
This may sound silly, but it's true.
I felt I would be unfaithful to Charlie if I slept with you.
Rose, it's not silly.
I felt that way when my wife died.
- You did?
- Absolutely.
'Course I didn't let that stop me.
You mean you'd just make love and feel lousy?
Well, I'd feel lousy about it.
But otherwise, I'd feel terrific.
Look, that's the difference between men and women, I guess.
We can do it no matter what.
Rose, I adored Molly, my wife.
We were married 34 years.
Never slept with another woman.
I looked, I enjoyed, I patted a few bottoms, but that was it, Rose.
No, Molly was my world.
Then one day a drunk in a Chevy took my world away.
For a year, I was a zombie.
I dressed, I worked, I slept.
For fun, I ate onion sandwiches.
Then one day, my daughter sat me down and she said, "Mom would hate what you're doing.
She would say, 'Arnie, who are you saving yourself for?
I'm dead.
And I'm not in heaven if I have to worry about you.
"' That convinced me.
I wonder what Charlie would say, if he knew.
Probably the same thing Molly said.
Molly didn't actually say that, Rose.
- There's something else.
- Oh?
I might kill you.
What?
What are you talking about?
I've never told anybody this in my life, but my husband died while he was making love to me.
And I'm afraid if we make love, I'll kill you.
If you haven't made love in 15 years, that's a possibility.
Hey, Rose Rose, don't worry about it.
Listen, I had a checkup a couple of weeks ago - I got the heart of a 12-year-old.
Rose, whatever you want to do is fine with me.
I just like being with you.
Hey, I'd better pack my stuff.
- Arnie?
- Yeah?
Sit down.
Hold me.
Buzz off.
- I'll spot you 25 points.
- Aw, Ma, enough already.
I'm not gonna play cards with you anymore.
- Why not?
- Why should I?
You're the only one who gets any enjoyment out of it.
- Nah, cards bore me to tears.
- Then why do you play?
- I like the talking.
- The what?
The talking.
You and I had some of our best talks over a game of gin rummy.
I don't know why.
It just seemed easier for both of us to open up while we were playing cards.
Your aunt Jean was the same way.
During a pinochle game, she told me that she swam nude in a pool with Charles Boyer.
Aunt Jean?
You never told me that.
I would have gotten around to it, but we stopped playing cards.
Rose is back.
Her taxi just pulled up.
Oh, I wonder if she had a great time on that cruise.
- She did if she fooled around.
- I can't wait to find out.
Oh, come on now.
It's none of our business.
- I bet she did.
- I bet she got cold feet.
Now listen, I want to know just as much as you two.
But what happened between her and Arnie is private.
If she wants to talk about it, fine.
But if she doesn't, I don't want anybody asking any embarrassing questions.
I'm back!
So, did you and Arnie play find the cannoli?
- What?
- Nothing, nothing Rose!
Just sit down here, honey, and tell us all about your trip.
Oh, it was fabulous!
The food was delicious.
The weather was absolutely gorgeous.
And the activities on board ship, well, the list goes on forever!
Masquerade balls, hootenannies, tours of the engine room, fashion shows, Jazzercize, Las Vegas Night, Monte Carlo Night, Rio Night, Riviera Night Who cares, Rose!
Did you and Arnie hit the sheets or not?
Dorothy!
- Some women don't kiss and tell.
- Oh, shoot, honey, that's half the fun.
Most of the boys I dated in college were just for the stories.
You must have more stories than O. Henry!
I'm gonna unpack.
Now, this isn't fair.
You have to tell us.
No, you don't.
But if you go out that door and don't come back in, we'll know you didn't.
And if you do come back, that means you did.
- It was wonderful.
- Oh!
Oh, honey, this is terrific!
Oh, I'm so happy, and I have you two to thank for it!
You two?
Don't you think Arnie should get at least an honorable mention?
I want you to know, going on this cruise changed my life.
Being with Arnie made me realize that I can care for a man again, without feeling guilty about it.
Oh, it's a nice feeling, you know, that when one part of your life is over, another part can begin.
Now I'm really gonna unpack.
Oh, let me help you, honey.
I'll get the juicy details.
Ma, Persian Rummy?
- 500 points?
- Penny a point.
You deal.
I meant to tell you, I got a card from Gloria Pelizado today.
Oh, how many stamps did she use?
Gloria Pelizado's been dead for two years.
Who said Gloria Pelizado?
I said Flo Pelizado.
- Why don't you pay attention?
- Oh, how is Flo?
Oh, beautiful.
She and her second husband, Pete, are in Rome.
You remember Pete, the man you could have had?
I did have him.
That's why I didn't want him.
You and Pete?
You never told me that!
Later, later.
First I want to hear about Aunt Jean and Charles Boyer.
Oh, you know your Aunt Jean.
She was always just two steps away from the gutter.
Anyway, one summer she decided to
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Oh, it's a mess!
This place is just a mess!
Rose, what am I gonna do?
She's gonna be here any minute.
- This place is a pigsty!
- Oh, Blanche, it looks gorgeous.
Don't sit!
I just fluffed!
- Honey, dust the table.
- I just did.
Well, do it again.
God, I wish she wasn't coming.
I just hate her.
I can't believe you hate your sister.
I despise her.
Oh, I wish I'd gotten a decorator.
Nancy Reagan's decorator.
That'd kill my sister.
She's your sister.
How can you hate your sister?
Because she made me and my big sister Charmaine miserable our entire lives.
I never heard of such a thing.
You never heard of anybody hating their sister?
Never.
Maybe it's Southern.
Sleeping with your brothers is Southern.
Dust, Rose, dust!
We're running out of time.
Sophia if you hated your sister, would you clean the house?
I'd put Vaseline on the tips of her walker.
Everybody, look what I have.
- Where did you find?
- Oh!
Don't sit!
Don't sit!
- Oh, what is our name?
- This is Danny.
- Dorothy, what in the world is that?
- It's a flounder, Blanche.
- What do you think it is?
- What's that baby doing here?
It's Lucy and Ted's baby.
Ted had a little accident waterskiing, and Lucy's taking him to the hospital.
Now, we cannot have a baby in this house.
My sister's coming.
Does she eat them?
I have cleaned this house from top to bottom.
I have killed myself for two days.
Babies make a mess.
In diapers.
And unless we use them as placemats, your sister will never know.
- Oh, Lord.
- Boochie-boochie-boo.
Oochie-oochie-boo-boo.
Finally - someone she can talk to.
I just hope it doesn't make a fuss when my sister's here.
- I thought you hate this sister.
- I do.
I'm gonna put him to bed.
Ma, the ba-bas.
Why do you hate your sister?
That's what I wanna know.
Because when she was born, I ceased to exist.
I never saw my mama and daddy again.
Where did they go?
They never looked at me again, Rose.
She was the adorable one, the gorgeous one, the brilliant one.
She sat in my daddy's lap for 16 years.
Oh, and she was hateful.
You know what she used to do?
She used to bite herself on the arm and then run crying to Daddy that I had done it and he'd punish me.
Oh, she got me in trouble all the time.
Daddy used to call me the bad seed.
- Once, she even electrocuted me.
- Oh, no!
Oh, yes.
It was the day before Christmas and we were playing and she jiggled the tree and the star fell off and broke.
So she told me to pick it up and put it on my finger.
And I did.
Then she plugged it in.
And wham!
My eyes bugged out, my hair shot straight up.
I did a crazy rubber dance all over the room.
I'm sure my heart stopped beating for a minute.
Then she ran to Daddy and told him I'd broken the star and almost electrocuted her.
And he sent me to my room for all of Christmas Eve and told me that the baby Jesus was mad at me for ruining his birthday.
- Blanche, that's horrible.
- And that's not the worst part.
That darn electricity straightened my hair.
I used to have curly hair.
That was a lovely lunch, Blanche.
A lovely lunch in a lovely house with your lovely friends.
Stop making fun of me, Virginia.
Making fun of you?
Honey, I was complimenting you.
- I heard the way you said "lovely.
" - How did I say "lovely"?
Oh, you know very well how you said "lovely.
" You said "lovely" the same way you say "lovely" to a date who's just shown up in a light-blue tuxedo.
Well, I meant "lovely" no matter how it came out.
I guess maybe I just didn't think you'd recognize good taste.
You know, this house was done by Nancy Reagan's decorator.
- Really?
- Yes.
But never mind about that.
Let's talk about you.
- You look like you lost weight, sugar.
- I have.
Hm.
You know, at your age, when you lose weight, your skin just hangs there.
Like leaves on a willow.
I haven't lost that much.
I don't think that's happened yet.
Well, I don't know.
But if I were you, I sure wouldn't wave goodbye.
And if I were you, I sure wouldn't jog without a muumuu.
Is that so?
Well, just let me tell you something!
Oh, Blanche, please.
Let's not do this.
Let's grow up.
For God's sake, we have done this our whole lives long!
Let's call an end to it, OK?
Sure, whatever.
So you thinking about getting a face-lift?
For your - how do I put this delicately?
- turkey wattle or what?
There, there.
It's colic.
My children had it.
- You give them brandy.
- For colic?
Yes.
After dinner with a cigar.
Rose, you give brandy for teething.
You rub it on their gums.
Oh.
I thought I gave it to them for colic.
In their bottles.
Well, my babies were very happy.
Put it in my bottle.
I'll be happy too.
Look at this - pop-ups.
Isn't that wonderful?
Mm.
Remember when we had to use cotton and fish ointment?
That's nothing.
In Sicily, we use a leaf and the river.
Ma, you never had a baby in Sicily.
I was a baby in Sicily.
Disposable bottles and formula.
We had to sterilize our bottles and make our formula.
I nursed.
Your brother was 12 when he stopped.
He wanted to come home from school at lunchtime.
- I got nothing left up here.
- Oh, Ma.
Well, she's gone.
That's it?
That's why we couldn't sit on the couch for two days?
No.
I have to have dinner with her tonight.
Why is that baby still here?
They're still at the hospital.
It's taking a little longer than they thought.
- Blanche, your sister seemed very nice.
- She was nicer than she's ever been.
She was interested, charming, caring, loving.
Just couldn't have been more wonderful.
I just wonder what she wants, the conniving little witch.
You're welcome, Maurice.
- Let's make a toast.
- With water?
- Well, I can't drink.
- You never could.
One Jack Daniel's and you'd disappear with half a fraternity house.
- We said we weren't gonna do this.
- Well, what else can we do?
We never held a real conversation our entire lives.
- Then it's time for us to start, OK?
- Fine with me.
To us.
To the beginning of a new and wonderful relationship.
- To sisters.
- That's very sweet, Virginia.
Now, what do you want?
What is it with you?
You just step on any kind of tender moment.
Oh, tender moment, my foot.
All my life you've taken everything that ever meant anything to me.
What did I take?
A couple of cashmere sweaters and a poodle skirt?
You took my poodle skirt?
Was that you?
Blanche, that was over 40 years ago.
Oh, shut up.
I can't believe that you are still crazy about that.
It's not over that.
- It's over Tom.
- Tom?
Don't act so surprised, Virginia.
You knew I was dating him.
Then I had to go to the country to visit Aunt Augusta and when I got back, I had poison ivy and you had Tom.
I loved that boy.
I wanted to marry him.
We were serious.
- You only had two dates with him.
- I was fast.
I swear I didn't think that you liked him at all.
Then I had to be maid of honor at your wedding.
I had to stand there and watch you marry Tom.
And I had to wear that green dress, which you knew was my most awful color.
I looked just like a swamp frog.
Everyone I ever loved, you took.
Would it help you to know that Tom fooled around?
No.
With who?
- Everyone.
- Huh.
Serves you right.
- Blanche!
- Well, it does.
What goes around, comes around.
Well, then, I must have been really bad.
- What do you mean?
- Well, it's the reason I'm here.
I knew it.
I knew you had a reason.
Better be a good one.
I'm dying.
What?
I'm dying.
Well my God.
That explains it, then.
What?
Why you're looking so much older than I am.
Ma, could you eat a little more quietly, please?
These are Fritos.
You want me to swallow them whole?
- Hi, everybody.
- Hi, Blanche.
Oh, the baby gone?
No, Rose is driving him around to get him to sleep.
- Why is he still here?
- Ted needs some minor surgery, so they're still at the hospital.
- What about Virginia?
- Well - Shh-shh-shh-shh.
- Is he asleep?
- You need any help?
- No.
- We're gonna have that baby till college.
- Shh.
- So how was dinner?
- I'm still in shock.
What happened?
- I just can't believe it.
- What?
- You never think you're gonna hear that.
- Blanche, tell me.
- She's dying.
- What?
- My sister's dying.
- What?
- Dying, she's dying.
- Oh, my God, Blanche!
Oh, honey, I didn't even know you were sick!
- Not Blanche.
Her sister!
- Oh, thank God!
Oh!
And she came here to tell you.
Is that it?
No, please.
She could've done that over the phone.
- It was like I said.
She wanted something.
- Enough already!
I mean, the woman is dying.
What could she possibly want from you?
My kidney.
Your kidney?
My kidney.
- Why would she need a kidney?
- To feed the cat, Rose!
She's going into renal failure, so a transplant is her best hope.
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.
What happens if she doesn't get your kidney?
She'll die.
You hold her life in your hands?
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.
I'm glad you're not my sister.
- I need something to eat.
- Didn't you just have dinner?
Oh, I couldn't eat.
I was just too stunned.
- What are you gonna do, Blanche?
- I don't know.
I mean, it's not as if she were my daughter.
She's my sister.
My sister that I hate.
I wish I could give her my kidneys, let her get up all night.
And what if I give her my kidney and then the one good kidney I have left stops working?
- What'll I do then, ask for my kidney back?
- You'd be an Indian giver.
I need both my kidneys.
You know what'll happen if I give her one?
My ankles will swell, my eyes will puff up.
I'll look just like the Pillsbury Doughboy.
Blanche, that does not happen.
You can live just fine with one kidney.
I can't eat this food.
I'm going to bed.
I'll just think about it tomorrow.
All I know is, girls, I'm in a no-win situation here.
I lose a sister or a kidney.
Either way, no matter what I do, I'm gonna lose something.
What would you do?
For my children, I wouldn't even have to think.
I mean, I'd give them both of my kidneys.
I'd cut 'em out myself.
Me too.
I'd give them my heart.
I'd give to all my children, except Phil.
- Why not Phil?
- Because he never calls, he never writes.
I only hear from him at Christmas when he sends me a cheddar cheese nativity scene.
I'm Catholic.
I can't spread a wise man on a Ritz cracker.
If I still had my dog Fluffy, I'd give to him.
- You'd give what to Fluffy?
- My kidney.
Oh, come on, Rose.
You'd give a kidney to a dog?
- Absolutely.
- So he could whiz on your rug?
I would give to him because of everything he gave to me.
He was loving, he was loyal, he was fun.
He never left my side.
I wish my ex had been like Fluffy.
Would've solved a lot of problems.
You could've had him fixed.
Oh, poor Blanche.
Blanche, I know you need some time to think it over.
You're damn right I do.
We're talking about a vital organ in my body here.
I know.
- You gonna give it to her or not?
- Sophia.
What does it mean - a little less bourbon?
It's a big decision, Sophia.
She's got to think about it.
She's family.
If you can't count on family, who the hell can you count on?
She's Italian.
I'll understand, you know, if you decide not to.
How come you didn't ask Charmaine for her kidney?
You were always closer to Charmaine.
Charmaine's kidneys are attached to each other.
- What do you mean, attached?
- The two are joined.
It's like having one big kidney, and you can't separate 'em.
Leave it to Charmaine.
I know.
She never could help Mama because she had heart flutters, and she never could take gym class, no, because she had a tipped uterus, and she never did any housework because she had a spastic colon.
Now, she has attached kidneys.
That girl is some kind of mutant.
I'd give you one of my kidneys, but I'm sure you'd rather have one you can control.
- Thank you, Sophia.
- Welcome.
Look, if you decide not to, I'll understand.
I swear.
Sure, you'll be dead.
And everybody will say Blanche killed her.
What I'm trying to say is it's a terrible choice I've given you.
I don't even know what I would do under the same circumstances.
Are you saying you don't know if you'd give me a kidney?
No, I don't.
Well, I'm not surprised.
You never even lent me a Kleenex.
Besides, I'm a size eight - your kidney wouldn't fit me.
There's not room in my body for your kidney.
Well, I guess I'd better be going, and if you decide to go ahead with it, I'll see you in Atlanta in a few days.
- Are you scared?
- Terrified.
- I guess anybody would be.
- I guess.
Blanche, whatever happens I love you.
Thank you.
Bye.
The doctor says it's the first time he'd ever been called because a baby was sleeping in the day.
And then I think he called me an idiot.
He sleeps in the day because he has four women who won't let him sleep at night.
Now, who went in there last night?
Was it you?
- Well, I went in once.
- Why?
- I was working.
I hadn't seen him all day.
- And was he sleeping?
At first.
This has got to stop.
No wonder that baby didn't sleep.
He wasn't the only one who was up all night.
- You were too?
- Yes.
- I had time to do a lot of thinking.
- And?
- And of course I'm gonna do it.
- Aw, Blanche, you're a brave lady.
- Oh, you really are, honey.
- No, I have to.
I don't want my sister to die.
I want her to live.
And not just for her, for me.
I wanna get to know her like a grownup.
Well, I want us to have a chance to be friends, sisters.
After all, she's the only family I have.
I thought you had a sister, Charmaine.
Oh, you can't count her!
Why, she's an awful, selfish, neurotic woman who made me and Virginia miserable our entire lives.
I gotta go pack.
- I hate to give him back.
- Goodbye, Danny.
Goodbye, pussycat.
Goodbye, little fella.
What are you carrying on?
It's like talking to a salami.
Well, he has to leave.
I'll be right back.
- Say bye-zee-bye!
- Bye, darling.
You be good now.
I'm worried about Blanche.
I wish she'd let one of us go with her.
Not me.
I hate hospitals.
My friend Matty Fishbein went into the hospital a healthy guy.
Then boom, boom - dead, just like that, in his sleep.
I don't like hospitals either.
They're full of germs.
I always hold my breath in the elevators 'cause there are sick people in the elevators and it's such a small space.
Once, I had to go to the eighth floor in a hospital, and the elevator stopped on every floor, and I had to hold my breath all that time.
And I finally fainted and I hit my head and I had to stay there because I had a concussion, and I had to hold my breath all the way down in the elevator to the emergency room.
Then I had to hold my breath in the x-ray, where they ask you to hold your breath anyway.
And then after I have great news.
Rose, excuse me.
We'll get back to your fascinating hospital story later.
Ted and Lucy said that we could have the baby again next month - when they go away for a weekend.
- Oh, that's wonderful.
Oh, I'm so excited.
Hello, everybody.
Blanche, what are you doing here?
Is something wrong?
I mean, we didn't expect you back so soon.
Oh, the best possible thing has happened.
I still have both my kidneys and my sister's fine.
Blanche, how is that possible?
They couldn't use my kidney - my blood vessels were too small.
Of course they're too small.
I've always been very petite.
Blanche, Virginia.
Oh, the most wonderful thing happened.
They found a donor, an excellent match.
She was a retired Mormon schoolteacher.
Virginia's so lucky!
Oh, I'll say.
That kidney was showroom-new.
Why, the wildest thing that ever passed through there was Ovaltine.
But the best part of it was that hunk of a doctor who examined me - he's gonna be in Florida in a few weeks.
Wherever she goes, she finds a man!
So do hookers.
But the most wonderful thing about all this is Virginia and me.
All that time we wasted hating each other from when we were kids.
Now we're getting to know each other, and I just love her.
I finally have a sister to love.
Isn't it funny?
Sometimes you have to almost lose somebody before you realize how much they really mean to you.
Let's go out and celebrate life.
Let's go out and do something crazy!
Let's fly to Freeport and gamble all night.
Ma, we can't afford it.
Let's drive to Disney World and ride the Teacups!
Oh, too wild, Rose.
Hey, I know a bar over in Coco Beach where you can pick up over-the-hill astronauts.
Ow!
Or there's some Rocky Road in the freezer.
Hey, great!
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Wait a minute!
Just where do you think you're going?
Over to Mildred's to watch the adult movie channel.
She has a wide-screen TV.
You are not going anywhere.
Dr. Clayton is coming.
- Dr. Silvano is my doctor!
- Dr. Silvano is dead.
Trust me, I'm in better shape than he is.
Goodbye.
Ma, you have to have an examination.
Your blood pressure is up, you're tired, you have absolutely no color.
I'm an old white woman.
I'm not supposed to have color.
You want color?
Talk to Lena Horne.
Here we are, Sophia.
Homemade chicken soup.
I used to make it for my husband when he wasn't feeling well.
Did you make it for him the last time he wasn't feeling well?
- Hello, everyone.
- Hi, Blanche.
I just happened upon the most divine dress sale.
I would'have called you girls, but all they had left were petites.
So what did you buy?
Shoes?
I'm a petite.
I'd better go there.
I need a black dress for Dr. Silvano's funeral.
Dr. Silvano died two months ago.
You went to his funeral.
Right, I can't let him see me in the same dress.
Ma, you're not going anywhere until the doctor comes!
You can't go anywhere now.
I want you to see how good I look in my new dress!
You know something?
We're really lucky we found a doctor who makes house calls.
I know.
When I was growing up in Minnesota, the doctor made house calls all the time for us and the livestock.
You and the animals had the same doctor?
Sure.
Worked out fine until the doctor started drinking hog liniment and tried to neuter the Swensen brothers.
(doorbell If that's the doctor, tell him I have no insurance and no money!
If he still wants to come in, he just wants to see me naked.
Hello, I'm Dr. Clayton.
I'm here to see Sophia Petrillo.
Oh please, please come right in.
I'm Dorothy, Sophia's daughter, and I usually look much better.
Now, this is my friend, Rose.
- Hello, doctor.
- Rose.
And this is Sophia.
- What seems to be her problem?
- Her blood pressure is up and she's a little pale and a little tired.
- She on any medication?
- Yes, to control blood pressure.
- How long's she been on that medication?
- What am I, two years old?
I don't know my own symptoms?
I've lived in this body since I was born.
If something goes wrong, I'm the first one to hear about it!
I'm sorry, Sophia.
What seems to be the problem?
What am I, a doctor?
Why don't we start by taking your temperature, huh?
Temperature, hmm.
He must have graduated at the top of his class.
- Under your tongue.
- Uh, tell me, - are you new to this area, Dr. Clayton?
- Yes.
I recently moved here.
Oh, Miami's a beautiful city.
I'm sure you'll enjoy living here.
Yes, and I'm sure your wife, Mrs. Clayton, will enjoy it, too.
Mrs. Clayton and I are no longer together.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
So, tell me, have you had a chance - to see much of the city?
- No, not really.
Perhaps I could show you some of the highlights sometime.
That sounds great.
I'd love it!
I'd love to go, too.
Except I have to wash my hair every day for the rest of my life.
It's very oily.
What about dinner tomorrow night, Dorothy?
Say, about eight?
Perfect!
We'll go to Jack's Crab House.
It's wonderful.
Well, girls, is this dress gonna stop traffic or what?
Oh, hello there.
I don't believe we've been introduced.
My name is Blanche Deveraux.
That's French for "Blanche Deveraux.
" - I'm pleased to meet you.
- Forgive me for staring, but I do declare, you're just about the most attractive man I've seen in Florida since Mr. John Forsythe performed Hamlet at the Burt Reynolds Dinner Theatre.
Blanche, might I see you a moment?
Pardonnez-moi.
Listen, you keep your bloomers on, Scarlett.
He's taking me out tomorrow night.
But he wants me.
I can feel it.
Let somebody else feel it.
- I saw him first.
- But we were meant for each other.
- I'm a woman, he's a man.
- And what am I, Little Richard?
Oh, all right.
Fair's fair.
But if he has a friend who makes house calls, I can be ill any night this week except Thursday.
- Well, doctor, how is she?
- Her temperature seems to be normal.
Tell me, Sophia, are you taking your medication as directed?
I take my medication every day, if I remember.
You have to remember to take it every day.
Oh, I'll see that she does, Dr. Clayton.
Elliot.
Well, ladies, it's been a great pleasure meeting you.
Dorothy, it's been especially nice meeting you.
I'm sure she's all right, but you call me if you need me, and I'll see you tomorrow night.
- Goodbye, Elliot.
- Goodbye, Dorothy.
Oh, thank you for being a kind and generous god.
OK, what do you think of this one?
Dorothy, you and Elliot have been out almost every night this week.
He's obviously hooked.
You don't have to look good anymore.
What you have on is fine.
- I'll change.
- Come on.
I'll help you pick out something.
There's nothing left to pick.
The only thing I haven't tried on is the bedspread.
(doorbell - Oh, hello, Elliot.
Come in.
- Hello, Blanche.
Dorothy ready?
I'm afraid she's gonna be a little while.
May I offer you a drink?
Why, sure, if you'll join me.
I don't mind if I do.
What would you like?
Something smooth and sweet with a little kick to it.
Hmm.
How about a Sloe Gin Fizz?
You're talking about the drink and I'm talking about the bartender.
- Oh.
- Blanche, you feel all right?
- You feel a little flushed.
- I do?
Yeah, let me check your pulse.
Ooh, it's racing.
You know what?
So is mine.
I beg your pardon?
- You're a very attractive woman, Blanche.
- I know.
Very very attractive.
Wait a minute.
What are you doing?
How dare you?
- What kind of woman do you think I am?
- Relax.
Relax?
Don't you tell me to relax!
I am not accustomed to being manhandled.
- I thought you'd be flattered.
- Well, I'm not.
Pardon my strong language, but you, sir, are no gentleman.
- I'm sorry.
- You ought to be.
What about Dorothy?
- She happens to be my friend.
- No reason to bring Dorothy into this.
- Hmm.
- Hi, Elliot.
Hello, Rose.
My, what is that marvelous scent you're wearing?
Fancy albacore tuna.
I made a casserole for dinner.
Well, you certainly wear it well.
I think it's the pimento that really sets it off.
- Hello, Elliot.
I'm sorry I'm late.
- It's all right, but we should be going.
If I'm not back by Christmas, someone take my mother to midnight mass.
There is something about that man I don't trust.
I can't put my finger on it.
I can.
He's a letch.
No, that isn't it.
Oh, yes it is, Rose.
He made a pass at me.
Oh, my Lord!
That's terrible!
Dorothy'll be heartbroken when you tell her.
- I'm not telling her anything.
- She's your friend.
- You've got to tell her!
- Oh, no, I don't.
The last time a friend's sweetheart made a pass at me, I lost my friend and her beau.
- And her beau?
- That's right.
Anderbeau Johnson.
Clyde Whitehead, Anderbeau's beau, decided he wanted to see my cheerleader's sweater from the inside.
So when I told Anderbeau, she blamed the whole thing on me, and then Clyde would never speak to me again for telling!
I lost Anderbeau and her beau!
Now you understand why I can't tell Dorothy?
I don't even understand who Anderbobo is.
All I know is that Dorothy should find out what kind of a man Elliot really is.
Now, if you're her friend, you'll tell her.
But honey, she'd be devastated!
What kind of a friend would I be to hurt her?
What kind of a friend would you be if you let Elliot ruin her life?
She could marry that man!
They could have a child!
They could adopt a child!
And then one night at the country club, possibly during little Mei-Ling's coming-out party Dorothy's having the time of her life when she goes to the powder room and she overhears the towel lady telling Mrs. Steinbeck that Dorothy's husband, Dr. Elliot Clayton, has bonged every female member of the country club.
Can you let that happen to Dorothy?
Can you let that happen to little Mei-Ling?
Hasn't she suffered enough?
Not as much as I have listening to that story.
Oh forget the story.
You have to tell Dorothy.
She's your friend!
You're right.
She is my best friend.
- I thought I was your best friend.
- You were till you told me that story.
- Thank you.
- Good night, Dorothy.
Good night, Elliot.
Oh, Dorothy.
I thought you'd never come home.
I have to talk to you.
- Is something wrong?
Is it Ma?
- Oh, no, she's fine.
It's just that you're out so late on a school night.
- What?
- I mean, how was your date with Elliot?
Wonderful, as usual.
Dorothy, I have to tell you something.
It's just so hard.
I don't know how to tell you, except, I guess, just straight out.
What?
Well Elliot made Elliot made What?
Elliot made a What?
What did Elliot make, a ship in a bottle?
What?
Elliot made a pass at me.
Elliot made a pass at you?
You mean, he winked at you.
He winks at everyone.
He's a very big winker.
No.
It was more than a wink.
He came up to me, and he put his big, masculine arms around my tiny little waist.
- I don't believe you.
- What?
I don't believe that he put his big, masculine arms around your alleged tiny little waist.
Why would I make up such a thing?
- Because you're jealous.
- Jealous?
You're used to getting all the attention, and someone comes along and wants me and not you and it is eating your guts out.
- Eating my guts out?
- You know something?
You could never be a real friend to another woman, and you know why?
- Why?
- Because you're a slut!
- A slut?
!
- Don't repeat everything I say.
Don't repeat everything you say?
I'm not!
- You just did.
- Nothing you say's worth repeatin'.
You, Blanche, are an amoral, backstabbing, self-centered Jezebel, and I am very glad that this happened because now I know really what kind of person you are.
The hell with you and your oversexed boyfriend, Dorothy Zbornak!
I'm just glad that little Mei-Ling's coming-out party was ruined.
Who?
And I'm glad that Elliot is bonging every woman at your country club!
What the hell are you talking about?
Ask the towel lady!
Morning, Blanche.
Can I get you some coffee?
"Dorothy deserves to know what kind of a person Elliot really is.
If you're her friend, you'll tell her.
" Thanks for the advice, Rose.
Now Dorothy's not speaking to me, and I'm not speaking to you.
Now you can get me that coffee.
I know it doesn't feel like it right now, but you did the right thing by telling Dorothy about Elliot.
- What about Elliot?
- He made a pass at me.
- While he's seeing my Dorothy?
- Yes.
I can't believe it!
My daughter is finally dating a doctor he turns out to be a scuzz bucket!
Why does everything happen to me?
- Dorothy hates me.
- Oh, Blanche, that's not true!
Oh, yes it is, and I hate her right back double.
Now get me some cream.
Morning, Dorothy.
Blanche and I were just having some coffee.
- Would you care to join us?
- Frankly, Rose, I would rather use Willie Nelson's hairbrush.
Must you attack everything Southern?
Come on, now, girls.
This is no way to behave.
Isn't there some way we can settle this like rational adults?
We can, once Dorothy stops acting like a child.
I am acting like a child?
Do you know what your problem is?
- (doorbell - That's Elliot.
I have to leave.
How dare you leave in the middle of a fight?
You come back here!
I have a few things I want to say to you, missy!
All right, girls, now hold it right there, and I'm not fooling around!
Dorothy, I think you have to confront Elliot with Blanche's accusation.
Absolutely not!
Now, I have to go.
Morning, Dorothy.
Ready to go?
Not quite.
Elliot, Blanche says that you made a pass at her.
- What?
- You heard her.
- I don't know what to say.
- You sure knew what to say last night Elliot, did you make a pass at Blanche or not?
- Absolutely not.
- He's lying.
Look at him, he's twitching and blinking.
He's lying and twitching and blinking.
He is blinking, Dorothy.
Maybe I had better wait for you in the car.
Dorothy, you just have to believe me.
It's not enough that you have had half the men in Dade County.
You have to have everyone else's men.
It is pathetic.
I have just never felt so betrayed in all my life.
I haven't been a good friend to a lot of people, but I have been a very good friend to you, Dorothy.
And you take some stranger's word over mine?
I'm not gonna stand for this, not in my own house.
I want you out of here.
Blanche, you don't mean that.
She doesn't mean it.
- I do so mean it.
- I'll be out as soon as I can find a place.
Blanche, you can't just throw Dorothy out on the street!
You just watch me.
What's the matter, Sophia?
You couldn't sleep, either?
No, I was sleeping great, Rose.
I just wanted to show off my pajamas.
I'm upset about Dorothy and Blanche.
Oh, me, too.
Who'd believe that they'd break up their friendship over a man?
- It happens.
- What can we do?
- Nothing.
Just stay out of it.
- I can't do that.
Let me tell you a story.
Sicily, 1912.
Picture this: Two young girls, best friends, who shared three things a pizza recipe, some dough, and a dream.
Everything is going great until one day, a fast-talking pepperoni salesman gallops into town.
Of course, both girls are impressed.
He dates one one night, the other, the next night.
Pretty soon, he drives a wedge between them.
Before you know it, the pizza suffers, the business suffers, the friendship suffers.
The girls part company and head for America, never to see one another again.
Rose, one of those girls was me.
The other one you probably know as Mama Celeste.
Sophia, what's the point?
The point is, I lost a fortune!
What does that have to do with getting Dorothy and Blanche back together?
Nothing!
I told you, stay out of it!
I can't!
I can't just stand by and watch this happen.
I've got to do something.
That might work, too.
Abbondanzal Rose, honey, can I borrow your golf gloves?
I already packed mine.
- Only if you promise not to move out.
- I cannot promise that!
Then putt with bare hands!
(doorbell - Hi.
Ready to go?
- Soon as Rose lends me some gloves.
They're in the bottom drawer on the left, under my clarinet.
Be right back.
Has anyone ever told you you look exactly like Jerry Vale?
- No.
- They should.
He's the only man in the world that can make the hair on my arms stand up.
Can I fix you a drink?
No, thanks.
Is something wrong with your leg?
Nothing you can't fix, doctor man.
- I beg your pardon?
- I know I look square, but I'm like my father's tractor.
I take awhile to warm up, but once I get going, I can turn your topsoil 'til the cows come home.
Rose, please.
Wanna see some Polaroids of me in my tennis skirt?
Look, Rose, I'm flattered, and please, no offense, but you're just not my type.
- But Blanche was.
- That never happened.
Oh, yes it did.
Blanche told me all about it.
- She made it up.
- I don't think so.
Look, nothing came of it.
I did apologize to her.
- And you lied to me.
- Dorothy!
You lied to me about Blanche!
Dorothy, sweetheart, please try to understand.
It was no big deal.
Oh, you think so?
I probably lost one of my best friends because of you.
To me, that's a very big deal.
- I take it we're not playing golf.
- We're not playing anything anymore.
I'll call you in a few days when you've cooled down.
Don't bother.
I really have nothing to say to you.
- I'm so sorry, Dorothy.
- No, I'm the one who's sorry.
I have to go talk to Blanche.
I've been an idiot through this whole thing!
Darn right you have!
- (knock on door - Come in.
Oh, it's you.
Look, Blanche, we have to talk.
I don't have anything to say to you, Dorothy.
Then let me do the talking.
Elliot was just here and he told me the truth about what happened.
Well, I hate to say "I told you so," but I did.
I told you so!
Honey, I'm sorry for not believing you.
- There's no excuse for my behavior.
- There most certainly isn't.
I guess when it came down to it, I didn't believe you because I didn't want to.
Nobody ever believes me when I'm telling the truth.
I guess it's the curse of being a devastatingly beautiful woman.
Oh, please!
The only other woman who could possibly understand is Priscilla Presley and Susan Anton.
No, not Susan Anton.
Even my husband didn't believe me on our wedding night - when I told him he was the first.
- But George wasn't your first.
Well, he didn't know that!
The point is, he didn't believe me.
Look, Blanche Blanche, I'm sorry.
Do you think you can ever forgive me?
I don't know.
I have to think about it.
I understand.
OK, I've thought about it.
I forgive you!
Oh, Blanche, Blanche, thank you!
Oh, what the heck!
That's what friendship's all about.
Oh, Blanche, Dorothy!
Oh, I'm so glad you made up.
- I knew you couldn't stay mad for long.
- Of course we couldn't.
Oh, it takes a big woman to forgive somebody calling her a slut!
You!
Fight over?
Good.
Here, taste these.
I'm conducting a pizza challenge.
One of these is mine, one is Mama you-know-who's.
Taste them and tell me which you like better.
If I'm right, this could be worth millions.
My face could be in every freezer in America.
Mmm.
A, definitely.
- Mmm.
Yep, A. - Yeah, A. A, without a doubt.
You can't pick men and you can't pick pizza!
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Why do these things always happen to me?
I'm just a wreck.
I don't know what I'm gonna do!
Blanche, we go through this every morning.
Now admit it, you have cellulite.
I am not talking about cellulite which I don't have.
I'm talking about my daughter Janet.
I just got off the phone with her.
- She's having marital troubles.
- Oh, Blanche, I'm so sorry.
But they've decided to try and work things out, so they're going to Hawaii for a second honeymoon.
Sounds like they're trying to work it out.
Why are you upset?
Don't you listen?
She has cellulite.
Those are dimples.
- Dimples are on these cheeks!
- Ma!
I am upset because while they're in Hawaii for two weeks, they're leaving my Oh, Blanche, that's wonderful news!
Why, you shouldn't be upset.
No, I should be upset.
How am I supposed to study for my French final with a 14-year-old in the house?
It's hard enough with an 80-year-old.
- Are you referring to me?
- Of course not, Ma.
I'm referring to Cary Grant.
He's living in the broom closet.
Hey, it's Blanche's grandson.
We do for family.
You're right.
You're right.
I'm just being selfish.
- It probably won't be too bad.
- No, I suppose not.
But whatever will we do with him for two weeks?
There are plenty of things to do down here.
We can take him to Disneyworld, the Seaquarium, the Everglades, Rambo - Rambo?
- The movie with Sly Stallone.
I sat through it twice.
You'll love it!
He sweats like a pig and he doesn't put his shirt on!
It's not gonna work.
I'm not sharing my room.
Oh Ma, Ma I'm not thrilled with the arrangement either.
But for the two weeks that David is here, we'll make do.
Sure, it's easy for you.
I'm not the one who snores.
I do not snore.
Please!
I'll bet less disgusting noises come out of Ernest Borgnine!
I just fixed a special treat for David.
It's the same little after-school snack I used to make for my own son - a triple-decker BLT, a hearty helping of homemade potato salad, and a great big slice of double chocolate fudge cake.
Oh, where was he going after school?
The electric chair?
Oh, girls!
What's the matter?
Where's David?
I don't know where he is.
He wasn't on the plane.
Come on, Dorothy.
I'll help you move your things back to your room.
Oh, Ma.
Please!
Come on, Blanche.
Now calm down, calm down.
He probably missed the plane.
It can happen to anyone.
- I missed a plane once.
And a train - Rose, you miss a lot of things.
He got on the plane all right.
I checked with the airline.
You probably just missed each other at the airport.
Dorothy, I was standing there at the gate from the moment the first passenger got off.
I paged him.
I checked with airport security.
- I called the police.
- (doorbell Oh.
- David!
Oh, David!
- Grandma!
- Is this your kid?
- Honey, what happened to you?
It wasn't my fault, I promise.
He stowed away in the airplane lavatory when they landed in Miami and the authorities picked him up in the duty-free shop in Freeport.
- You went to the Bahamas?
- I went to the bathroom!
The next thing I know, I'm in the Bahamas.
I figured while I was there, I'd buy some perfume for you and your friends in the duty-free shop.
- David.
- I'd keep an eye on this one, lady.
Oh, I don't know how to thank you, officer.
But I would like to try.
I'm usually at Wally's for happy hour on Tuesdays.
Blanche!
- Ma'am.
- Bye.
David.
I ought to give you a good talking-to, but I'm just so glad you're all right, I'm willing to overlook this little incident.
Come on, I want you to meet my friends.
Hello, David.
I'm Dorothy.
This is Rose.
- Hello, David.
- Hey, what's happening?
This is Sophia.
Oh, we've just been so anxious to meet you!
Yeah, I'll believe that if you believe the Bahamas story.
You know, David, I went to the Bahamas once.
Oh, yeah?
Was it on the Nina, the Pinta, or the Santa Maria?
It was a DC-10.
I don't think it had a name.
Yeah, that's very funny, Rose.
Yeah, I'm gonna grab a bite to eat.
I passed this burger joint around the corner.
Looked like there might be some kids there.
Oh, but David, wait a minute.
You just got here.
- I'd really prefer you to stay.
- I planned a special meal for you, David.
- Tomorrow.
I love leftovers.
- Well, what time will you be back?
Hard to say.
It depends how late the guys from Miami Vice want to party.
Later!
Well, I don't believe that!
But then what can I expect?
His father's a Yankee.
I guess I should've given him some money.
- You should've given him a smack.
- Ma.
I don't believe in hitting children.
Personally, I like to lay into a kid with a melon baller.
It's got a nice weight, good balance in the hand.
And it's portable.
My father used to punish us by sending us to the dairy barn to milk Alice.
- Well, what's so terrible about that?
- You had to milk Alice sitting on a stool.
I thought you always milked a cow sitting on a stool.
No, no.
Alice had to sit on a stool.
You see, she was involved in this nasty plowing accident.
It was during spring planting and Daddy had hitched her up to the plow 'cause poor old Toby had gotten a fever and gone deaf Rose, Rose, Rose Sweetheart, save the story.
When David comes back, tell him.
That can be his punishment.
- Ma, what are you doing?
- Living.
Pardonnez-moi.
- I just can't study with the noise!
- Fine, I'll stop breathing.
Look, I haven't studied since David arrived.
My test is My test is in two weeks and I do not want to blow it.
- You'll pass.
- I don't want to pass.
I want an A. You're the same as you were in grade school - A's.
You always had to get an A. You're brother thought a book was to sit on.
You always had to get an A. - Good night.
- Good night, Ma.
If I breathe and it bothers you, put a pillow over my face.
How could I sleep with that racket?
- What racket?
- Your pencil.
- My pencil?
- You're pressing too hard.
It's making me crazy!
I give up.
- Look at me.
- What?
- You're getting a cold.
- No, I'm not.
Yes, you are.
Tomorrow, you'll have a cold.
What is this?
The curse of the catwoman?
- I'm a mother, I know these things.
- Good night, Ma.
Good night.
What's that smell?
I don't smell anything.
Are you wearing something?
A little Ben Gay on my knees.
A little Vicks on my chest.
A little Deep Heat on my neck.
What are you trying to do, pickle yourself so you'll live to be 100?
Fine, I'll wipe it off.
Tomorrow, I'll be in a wheelchair.
- Goodnight, Ma.
- Goodnight.
Keep it up, I'll need a Dramamine.
I'm trying to get comfortable.
Not me.
You get too comfortable, you don't wake up!
- Goodnight, Ma.
- Goodnight.
(snorting and clearing throat - Ma.
- What?
That noise.
What noise?
The noise you're making with your nose and throat.
I got a postnasal drip.
What would you like me to do, drown in phlegm?
- Good night, Ma.
- Good night.
You know, we haven't slept together since I was a little girl.
Thank God.
I used to get into your bed whenever I had that dream about the bear.
- Yeah.
The bear dream.
- I hated that dream.
A bear is eating you.
What's to love?
You were so cute.
You were always so polite when you woke me.
"Mommy, I'm having a bad dream.
Could I come in"?
I felt so safe with you.
Listen, I felt safe with you when you were three.
And you always used to smell from Midnight in Paris perfume.
Better than this, huh?
- It sure was nice.
- It still is.
- Good night, Ma.
- Good night, pussycat.
What in the world is going on here?
David, I said, what in the world is going on here?
I thought you were in bed!
I couldn't sleep, so I went out and got a pizza.
Made a few friends and we decided to have a party.
David, this is an inconvenience.
I mean, it is 2:00 in the morning.
Now please, ask your fr friends to leave.
Come on, girls.
Relax, loosen up!
Hey, life's too short.
Especially for you guys.
- David!
- I'll get the melon baller.
Take it easy, ladies.
Don't get your support hose in a knot.
That does it!
The party is over!
Everybody out, out!
Not you.
Out!
It's really been lovely.
And if anything is missing, I will give your names to every narc in this city.
Oh!
David, clean up this mess, then go to bed.
Hey, why don't you clean up the mess yourself?
What's the big deal?
We were just having some fun.
You know that those happen to be my friends you just threw out?
You know, this really stinks.
What am I supposed to do for the next two weeks, just sit around and listen to your arteries harden?
You stop that!
You know something?
I am having a real problem with your attitude!
Oh, really?
Well, you can all just kiss my attitude!
Ma.
Well, you wouldn't let me get the melon baller, so I improvised.
Is that all you Italians know how to do, scream and hit?
No, we also know how to make love and sing opera.
Mom, you had no right to hit him.
Oh, Blanche, I'm so sorry.
She should not have done that.
Well, I have to go talk to David.
I feel just awful about this.
This is like The Long Day's Journey Into Light.
Night.
Rose.
Night, Dorothy.
David, are you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
It's just that nobody ever hit me before.
I think I should go home.
Honey, you can't go home.
There's nobody there to take care of you.
That's OK.
I'd rather be there alone than trapped here with you.
Besides, I can take care of myself.
I've been doing it long enough.
What do you mean?
All Mom and Dad ever do is fight.
They don't even know I exist.
Have you tried telling them how you feel?
- They wouldn't listen.
- I'm listening.
Only because they dumped me on you and you feel you have to.
- No, David.
- You don't have to!
Just leave me alone!
"Trim the hedges, mow the lawn, paint the patio furniture, wash the windows, clean out the garage, scrub the denture cup.
" I added that.
I hate doing it.
This is too much.
I can't ask him to do this.
- Of course you can.
- Idle hands are the devil's workshop.
God, I wish I'd said that.
I don't see how doing all these chores is gonna make him feel loved.
Look, Blanche, the one thing that David has never had in his life is structure.
Doing chores will give him a little responsibility.
He might even start feeling good about himself.
And start hating me if I ask him to do all this!
Listen, Blanche, you do what is best for David, not what is easiest for you.
Yeah, we had chores on the farm.
Boys and girls.
When we finished, we had such a feeling of accomplishment.
We had to feed the chickens, slop the hogs, muck the stalls.
Please, I'm trying to eat here!
And after I finished all that, I still had to take care of Larry, my one-eyed pig.
What did you people do, run a farm for handicapped animals?
But you grew up in the country.
David's a city boy.
Oh, wait now, Blanche, come on.
I'm from New York.
I did chores.
I made the beds, I washed the dishes, scoured the pots, cleaned the bathroom, folded the laundry, took out the garbage.
My, my.
Did you attend a military school?
No, she lived with me.
- Did they have chores in Sicily?
- Are you kidding?
They invented chores in Sicily.
Crossing the street without getting pregnant was a chore in Sicily.
- Rose, never mention Sicily.
- Oh I guess when I was little, I didn't have to do anything.
And I raised my daughter the same way.
So that's why David is the way he is now.
So it's all my fault!
Oh, now, Blanche.
You can't blame yourself for David.
You're right.
It's my mother's fault.
I am gonna give this list to David and see that he starts right away.
How is it possible to get pregnant in Sicily just by crossing the street?
- Cheap Chianti and narrow streets.
- Oh If you wait a couple of minutes, I'll make you some sandwiches.
- Where you going?
- I don't know.
How you getting there?
- I'll take a bus.
- I see.
And when the bus gets to you-don't-know-where, - what will you do then?
- Get a job.
- Really?
- Yeah.
As what, Secretary of State?
- I gotta go.
- So you're just gonna wimp out, huh?
- I'm not wimping out.
- What do you call this?
Why should I stay here when I got all this crappy stuff to do?
And no one likes me anyway.
You know, first of all, buddy boy, life is full of crappy stuff to do.
It's everywhere, so you better get used to it.
The President has crappy stuff to do.
Second of all, your grandmother happens to like you.
My mother likes you.
She doesn't hit anyone unless she really cares.
Take it from me.
And I happen to like you.
- My life stinks.
- I know.
Things are tough at home and that really does stink.
But you have a choice.
You can tough it out or you can let it beat you.
But right now you're here, and this doesn't have to stink.
And if you stay and work at it and everything turns out, you'll have a place to visit when the things at home really get to stink.
- I just can't, like, come here whenever.
- You can just, like, come here whenever.
Well, I don't mind the gardening.
But it's, like, the vacuuming I hate.
- That's, like, for girls.
- Well, we can renegotiate.
I'll do the vacuuming if you'II, like, learn English.
Come on, I'll fix you something to eat.
All right, now, attention, everyone.
I want to propose a toast.
To Dorothy Zbornak, who got an A in her French class, proving that you can teach an old dog new tricks.
- And if anyone knows about tricks - Ma!
Thank you, ladies and gentleman.
Or should I say, merci beaucoup.
mes amies.
Oh, my, that was impressive!
Jane Goodall once taught an ape to rhumba - that's impressive!
Now, I would like to propose a toast.
To David, who in the past week has proven that he is one damn good kid.
Hear, hear.
You know, it's really been interesting.
I got hit, did chores, learned all about handicapped animals.
All in all, it hasn't been half-bad.
And if it's all right with you, I wouldn't mind living here full-time.
I would certainly have to discuss that with your parents.
Oh, Mom and Dad will say yes.
They'll be as happy with the idea as I am.
Well, I'm gonna get some ice cream.
Wait up!
I'll show you where I hide the good stuff.
Call his mother!
- Blanche, what are we gonna do?
- Do you think I should call his mother?
- I really think you should.
- All right, I will.
I don't want to send him back to an unhappy home, but we're grandmothers.
It wouldn't be fair to be this old and have to raise children.
Hello, baby, it's Mama!
Well, I'm fine, honey, I'm just fine.
I'm calling you about David.
No, he's fine.
Matter of fact, he's so happy here, Janet, that I've decided to keep him and raise him myself.
You heard me.
He says that you and Michael spend so much time arguing, that you don't have time for him.
Don't you take that tone with me, missy.
Yes, I realize you're his mother No, I don't suppose I can stop you if you insist on coming and getting him.
But you let me tell you this.
If you and Michael don't straighten up and give that boy the love and attention he deserves, I will kick your uppity butt till hell won't have it again!
She'll call us right back.
She has to wake up the Yankee.
- Well done, Blanche.
- Oh, absolutely.
Nice bluff.
That was no bluff.
I meant every word of it.
I would love to have a chance to raise David.
I might make up for the mess I made with Janet.
I still wish you'd let us drive you to the airport.
Oh, my cab's already here.
Besides, I've seen the way you all drive.
Oh!
I'm gonna miss you guys.
It was nice of your folks to let you join them in Hawaii.
Yeah, they've never ignored me on an island before.
David, you listen to me.
They want the three of you to start over from scratch, so the least you can do is meet them halfway.
- I'll try.
- I bet it'll be easier than you think.
Especially now that you have an alternative.
If things get too tough at home, you can always come here and live with us.
- Well - Bye, Grandma.
Bye, honey.
- Dorothy.
- Bye, love.
Rose.
See ya, slugger.
Bye, darling.
Bye.
Run, run, run!
Go.
Oh, I hope he's gonna be all right.
Oh, Dorothy that was so sweet of you, telling him he could come live with us.
I meant it!
It's gonna be awfully quiet around here without him.
I'll say.
No more listening to Dorothy snore!
Ma, I do not snore!
Please, I had to turn you from the window so you wouldn't inhale the drapes!
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Ma, what smells so great?
Nothing.
Just a little spaghetti sauce I threw together.
Oh, come on.
This is your special 14-hour sauce.
- What's the occasion?
- Nothing.
Oh, come on.
You haven't made this sauce since Uncle Dominic married off that daughter of his.
You know, the one who looks like Tony Bennett?
Now tell me what's going on.
Mmm.
I told you, nothing.
Oh, Sophia, that smells heavenly!
Is it Chef Boyardee?
Stick it in my heart, Rose.
It'll hurt less.
Oh, girls!
I cannot believe how extravagant I've been!
It cost too much money, but when I saw it in the window, I had to have it.
- What?
- Look at this.
What do you think about that?
It's hard to tell, Blanche.
We'd need to see both earrings on.
You silly.
I bought it to help Rose and me win the bowling tournament this year.
You think you have a shot at the trophy?
I thought the Nielsen twins were unbeatable.
I don't really care whether we win or not.
I just like to have fun.
And we sure had a good time last year, didn't we, partner?
It was OK.
You know, maybe I should get a partner and enter that tournament.
I used to be a pretty decent bowler.
Decent bowler?
You were a fabulous bowler - 180 average.
- 180?
- Come on.
Come on, Ma, you were always a better bowler than I was.
I know.
I do everything better than you.
Mmm.
If this sauce was a person, I'd get naked and make love to it.
God, I love you.
Hey, Ma?
Ma, you know that doubles bowling tournament is next weekend.
What do you say you and I team up and enter, huh?
No, I can't.
I'm too busy.
I'm sure I could find you a partner, Dorothy.
You're too busy doing what?
Here.
"Will be in Miami Thursday.
Hope to see you.
Respectfully yours, Augustine Bagatelli.
" Who is Augustine Bagatelli?
Nobody.
Just a boy I knew from my village in Sicily that I was engaged to once.
- What?
Well, what do you know?
Sophia has a past!
That's right, but unlike yours, I didn't need penicillin to get through it.
Ma, you never told me you were engaged.
What happened?
The war happened.
Augustine went off to fight and I never heard from him again until today.
I wonder why he looked you up after all this time?
Are you kidding?
He was crazy about me.
I was the only girl in the village who didn't want to be a nun.
Hey, hey, hey!
- How do I look?
- Like a widow in mourning.
Perfect.
He'll know I'm available.
- Hi, Dorothy.
- Oh, hi.
Oh, Sophia, did your friend die?
Rose, he hasn't come here yet.
Oh, well, you certainly look black.
Rose, did you get me a partner for the bowling tournament?
- Sure did.
You're all signed up.
- (doorbell - It's him!
- Want me to get it?
No, if he sees me sitting, he'll think I have arthritis!
- Sophia?
- Augustine?
You shrunk!
Hello, I'm Dorothy.
I'm Sophia's daughter.
Augustine Bagatelli.
I'm sure you two have a great deal to catch up on.
Nice to have met you.
Oh, Ma, I'll be right here in the kitchen in case he gets fresh.
Sorry.
So, uh, what's new?
- Not much.
You?
- Not much.
My condolences on your husband's passing.
Thank you.
I've been in mourning 22 years.
My wife's been dead 31 years.
Philomena Del Nero, she was from our village.
Is she the one whose father used to stand outside of town, drink Chianti, - and play with a top all day?
- Yes.
He lived with us for two years after we get married.
Thank God he drank himself to death.
- You feel like going for a walk?
- Oh, I'd love it!
Thank you, thank you.
This is so cute!
I think they're going for a walk.
Rose, get away from that door.
I can't help it.
I just think it's amazing that a man would look up his first love after all these years.
Well, I wonder why Italian men are so romantic.
It's the tight pants, Rose.
So who did you sign me up to bowl with?
Oh, I wanted to talk to you about that.
Well, I am stunned!
Just stunned!
Stunned is the only way to describe how stunned I am!
Just a minute, just a minute, Blanche.
Are you trying to tell us that you are stunned?
Don't you make fun of me, Dorothy Zbornak!
I just saw the signup sheet down at the bowling alley.
Rose dumped me as her partner!
And then the two of you signed up together.
I did it.
Dorothy's a better bowler than you are and I want to win this year!
Rose, how could you do a thing like this?
I admit it.
I have a problem.
I'm too competitive when it comes to athletics.
I've never told anybody this, but I had to transfer high schools because of a field hockey incident.
Rose, that was a terrible thing to do, dumping Blanche.
I'm not gonna be your partner.
Oh, no, I want you all to stay partners.
I've already got another partner.
I signed up with Olga Nielsen.
Ha-ha.
Olga Nielsen!
Oh, that's impossible!
Olga always bowls with her twin sister Sonja!
That was before Olga found out Sonja's been sleeping with her boyfriend Lars, and not telling him he had the wrong sister.
Oh, Rose Nyland, I can't wait to whip your butt!
Olga Nielsen is a terrific bowler!
They could beat us!
There is no "us," Rose.
I am not bowling with you!
Oh, Dorothy.
I don't ask many favors of you, but I'm asking one now.
I'm begging.
Please, as a friend, be my partner.
Blanche has somebody to bowl with.
You want somebody to bowl with.
I need somebody to bowl with.
Please, just say yes and nobody will get hurt.
Oh all right!
Unless we don't win Hi!
Oh, hi, Ma.
Where you been?
I took Augie to that cafeteria in the mall.
Ah.
You and Augie have been seeing a lot of each other - these past few days.
- Yeah, we've been having a lot of fun.
Augie's a terrific guy.
And a gentleman!
Every time I leave the table, he tries to stand up.
It's a shame he has to go back to Sicily so soon.
It would have been nice if the two of you had more time together.
I'm glad you said that because he wants me to go back with him.
What?
Not for good.
Just for the San Genero festival.
That's where we met, 65 years ago.
I want to go back.
Oh, gee, Ma.
I'm sorry, honey, but I can't let you go.
Who's asking your permission?
I'm going anyway.
Ma, look, I absolutely forbid it!
Come on, you've had a stroke, you have high blood pressure.
It would be lunacy to risk your health this way!
Listen, you are not the woman you used to be.
I'd feel terrible if something happened to you.
At my age, I can't worry about that.
This is special.
I've made up my mind!
I'm going.
Oh, then I'm wasting my breath.
You're a grown woman.
I can't tell you what to do.
I know.
Now lend me $1,200 for the airfare.
Non che pensa del I can't believe you're denying your own mother.
Denying her what?
Springsteen tickets, Rose.
Will you please stay out of this?
Dorothy's trying to keep Augustine and me apart.
That absolutely adorable man?
Dorothy, how could you?
Oh, Rose, you're such a good person.
Many, many times I wished you were my daughter.
Ma, please.
And you, Dorothy, are a tall disappointment.
I can understand why Rose is dumping you as her bowling partner.
Rose is dumping Blanche.
She is not dumping me.
Oh, yes she is.
I heard her on the phone!
Your mother's right, Dorothy.
You begged me to be your partner and now you're dumping me?
You and I could never beat Blanche and Olga Nielsen!
That's why I had to team up with her sister Sonja.
I need to win, Dorothy.
And let's face it, you are no Sonja Nielsen!
Rose, get professional help.
Well, I am devastated!
Just devastated!
- Devastated!
- Oh, knock it off!
You are not gonna believe what happened!
Those Nielsen twins are back together.
- What?
!
- Lars Lindquist, the man they were fighting over - he's dead.
Found slumped over a desk at his Volvo dealership.
When the girls found out about it, they decided to forgive each other.
Now they're back together in the tournament!
Oh, gee, Blanche.
It's too bad you won't have anybody to bowl with now.
We better get down to the alley for some practice, partner.
Forget it Rose.
I am dumping you!
Blanche, how would you like me to be your partner?
Oh, I would love it!
Dorothy, you can't do this.
Now I don't have a partner.
Yes, you do.
I'll be your partner, Rose.
Ma!
You think I can't take care of myself?
You think I'm too feeble to go to Sicily?
I'll show you who's not the woman she used to be!
- Come on, Blanche!
- I'm Rose.
Simple mistake.
Means nothing.
Blanche, let's go!
Come on, Blanche, let's go!
Blanche, wake up.
My wife will be home any minute.
Oh!
Where's my shoes?
Oh, Dorothy, that was a terrible thing to do!
I'm sorry, but we have to get down to the bowling alley.
Oh, it's 6:00 am.
Why are you making me do this?
You have to go!
The bowling tournament is tomorrow.
- Now, we need the practice!
- Oh, we practiced enough!
Every morning before work, every evening after work.
All I ever wanted was to look cute in my bowling outfit.
Honey, aren't you forgetting something?
Rose dumped you!
That's right!
She did.
I hate being dumped.
I just hate it.
I haven't been dumped since Wade Honeycutt threw me over for Rebecca Wilkinson, a girl who did not value her reputation.
- Did you let him get away with it?
- Hell, no!
- What did you do?
- Slept with his brother.
Come on, partner.
Let's go get even!
Oh, please, Blanche.
I'm 55 and Rose has six brothers!
I'm talking about the bowling alley.
I mean down at the bowling Shh.
I don't want them to know we're sneaking in all this extra practice.
Oh, right.
- Morning!
- Aha, morning.
Well, you two are up kinda early.
But not as early as you two.
But then again, you need the practice.
Dorothy, if you're so sure of yourself, how about a little side bet?
What did you have in mind?
If I win, you'll lend me the money to fly to Sicily with Augie.
No.
All right, fine.
But if I win, I get those antique silver earrings that you never let me borrow.
- You're on!
- Come on, Blanche.
Blanche, do you want to have a side bet with me?
Well, I would Rose, but everything you own is so damn ugly.
Oh, I can't wait to whip your butt!
Now here we are, alley number seven.
Oh, number seven!
That's my favorite!
- I'm so glad we got number seven.
- You're not superstitious?
No, it's adjacent to the men's locker room.
When that door opens, you can see right in there.
Who cares, Blanche.
We have more important things on our minds.
Take a load off, Rose.
We're here, alley number seven.
Wait a minute, what are you all doing here?
We're supposed to be sharing this alley with the Nielsen twins.
They had to drop out to go to Lars' funeral.
I thought Lars' funeral was yesterday.
It was, but he requested an authentic Viking funeral and every time they tried to set him and his ship on fire, the Coast Guard kept putting it out.
They had to reschedule for today.
Look at that!
I don't believe that!
Look at what they have on!
Oh, calm down, honey.
They're just trying to get to you.
Oh!
- Rose, take that off.
- What?
You are wearing my bowling outfit.
Why, I do believe you're right.
Oh, don't worry about it, honey, nobody will notice.
It looks so different on a woman with a full bosom.
Don't you throw your bosom in my face!
Blanche, Blanche, don't you see what's happening?
They are resorting to cheap tricks because they know we're better than they are.
Now honey, all we have to do to win is just stay cool, calm and collected.
All right.
Oh, did you find a ball that's comfortable, Ma?
- What did you call her?
- Ma.
We've grown very close the last few days.
Now listen, no one calls her "Ma" except me.
You got that?
Have I made that clear?
Dorothy, Dorothy, calm down, calm down.
What did I tell you?
I knew it would get under her skin.
All right, everybody's started except us.
Could we please begin?
OK, I'm up.
Strike.
Mark it down.
The ball hasn't even gotten there yet!
Look, all you've got is a one, two, three, four, - five, six, seven, eight, nine - Darn!
Strike!
Mark it down.
All right, Dorothy.
You go get 'em, darlin'.
Go get 'em good.
Nothing to it.
As I told you before, all we have to do to win is just stay calm, cool, and collected.
Another hot dog, Ma?
Darn!
I left three pins.
I can't believe it!
Ha-ha!
I can't believe you can swing that ball past your hip.
Rose, everyone is finished and I checked the score.
If you can pick up a spare in the last frame, we'll be leading the tournament!
Consider it done, Ma.
Go to it.
I did it!
I did it!
We're in the lead!
We're gonna win!
We're gonna win!
We're gonna win!
Rose, Rose, aren't you forgetting something?
We haven't bowled our last frame yet.
We can still win.
And we will.
Oh, I don't think so.
You see, I've bowled with Blanche before.
Maybe this isn't the best time to mention it, but when the chips are down, Blanche chokes.
Don't you, sweetheart?
Eat chalk, Nylund.
You go get 'em, Blanche.
Blanche?
Blanche?
I'm fine.
I just feel a little cold and clammy and just a little short of breath.
Now you just settle down, you hear me?
Settle down.
Don't make me do this, Dorothy.
This ball feels like it weighs about 100 pounds.
Honey, I sympathize with you.
Anyone who has ever competed understands what you're going through.
Listen, sweetheart, if you don't feel like bowling, you don't have to.
Oh, good.
You just hold onto the ball and I'll throw you down the alley.
This is embarrassing!
Get back out there!
No, I don't want to.
I just hate bowling.
All I ever wanted to do is look cute in my new outfit.
We all look cute in your new outfit!
Oh, that does it!
Ha!
I did it!
I did it!
You did what?
You knocked down two pins!
It's a personal triumph.
Well, we're not out of it yet.
All we need to win is a spare.
- Sophia!
- Hi, Augie!
- Did you win?
Can you go?
- I don't know yet.
Strike!
No, you left the nine pin.
Oh, easy spare.
I've made this shot 100 times.
Your daughter is a very good player, Sophia.
She must have picked it up from you, huh?
- How do you know I'm a good bowler?
- Because you were so good at bocce ball.
Remember, we played together once?
Oh, yeah.
After the grape harvest.
- Boy, that was a nice afternoon.
- Very nice.
You know what else was nice about that day?
- That was my first kiss.
- Mine too.
Go get 'em, Dorothy.
Whip their butts.
- Oh!
- Oh, Dorothy, a gutter ball!
A gutter ball!
We won!
We won!
I won!
I won!
You lost and I won!
- You lost the bet.
That means I'm going.
- You go, honey, and with my blessing.
I'm touched.
Do I have your 1200 bucks?
You have my blessing and you have my money.
For another thousand, I could go first class.
Arrivadercil So Augie and I took a bus to Palermo to look up our old friend Teresa DiFino.
We spent two hours on the bus.
Another hour looking for her house.
We finally find the house, knock on the door, and what do you know?
She died.
- Ma, it happens.
- That morning!
Yeah, but aside from that.
You and Augie really had a great time, huh?
The best.
Going home brought back a lot of nice memories.
And at my age, it's nice to have someone to share it with.
Oh, I almost forgot.
Here, this is for you.
Your antique earrings.
They're yours.
You won 'em fair and square.
Oh, come on.
What are you talking about?
You and Rose won that tournament.
Please.
You blew it on purpose.
The nine pin for the spare is your best shot.
You could make that shot all day long.
Here, enjoy them.
OK, OK, I gotta unpack.
I got a valise full of clams about to go bad.
- Hi, Dorothy.
- Don't talk to me.
- Hi, Blanche.
- Don't talk to me.
I know you're both still angry with me and you have every right to be, but I hope you can forgive me for the way I acted.
Winning doesn't mean anything if it means losing your two best friends.
Besides, we all bowled well this year.
That's why I had all our names engraved on this trophy.
- In my opinion, we're all winners.
- Well, Rose.
What a sweet thing to do.
- Oh, Rose, can I ask you a question?
- Sure.
Why is your name three times larger than ours?
Because I'm the one who actually won it.
If you ever want to look at it, it'll be in my bedroom.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Well, I loved her.
The name "Madonna" doesn't really fit her.
- "Slut" would be better.
- Sophia!
Oh, please, please.
She did things on that stage I never did with my husband.
Dorothy, what a thing to say!
- Oh!
- Oh, my!
- It's a mess!
- I've been robbed!
Oh, boy.
Shh.
Shh, be quiet!
They could still be here.
- Who?
- The Supreme Court.
Who?
- The robbers.
- Is there more than one?
- I don't know.
- You said "they.
" They, him, what difference does it make?
That's how they got in.
Oh, oh, but wait - they might still be here!
They're gonna kill us!
They're gonna kill us!
Stay!
This is a. 375 Magnum one of the most powerful handguns in the world.
It could blow your head off.
The only problem is, I don't remember if I shot four rounds or five.
So you have to ask yourself, do you feel lucky?
Well, do ya punk?
Go ahead, make her day.
- Sophia, where are you going?
- To my room.
- You can't.
It could be dangerous!
- Please, I'm 80.
- Bathtubs are dangerous!
- Oh, come on.
This is ridiculous.
They aren't here anymore.
Let's go check our rooms.
Oh, I just thank God they didn't take my Chinese vase.
- I'm gonna check the kitchen.
- Wait, don't leave me!
- What'll I do if they come back?
- Show them your slides of Hawaii.
I'm fine.
I'm just fine.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
These things happen every day.
The main thing is, nobody was hurt.
We could have been here.
They could have come in the middle of the night, while we slept.
They could have crept up on us and cut our throats!
- Now, look - Aah!
- What?
- I thought you were the killers.
Relax, relax.
I called the police.
They stole my stole.
- What?
- My mink stole.
- Oh, no.
- Stan gave it to me.
It was the only present he ever gave me that didn't need an extension cord.
They got my jewels.
But I see they didn't get your cocaine.
Oh, my God.
Blanche has cocaine?
This is flour.
I hid my jewels in the flour.
Why did you hide your jewels in the flour?
I didn't think they'd look there.
What kind of robbers look in the flour?
That's the first place they look after the freezer.
- The freezer's my other hidin' place.
- It's everybody's.
The robbers know that.
They don't even open drawers anymore.
My mama's jewels.
I can never replace them!
Oh, I'm just beside myself.
You ought to see the mess they made in there.
- They about tore this place apart.
- They were probably looking for drugs.
We have Maalox and estrogen.
Now, how many junkies have gas and hot flashes?
They cleaned me out, took everything I owned.
- All I have is what I have on.
- They took your clothes?
My clothes, my shoes, girdle, everything.
Thank God I'm insured.
Ma, why in the world would they want your clothes?
Who knows?
Short girl robber, travels a lot, likes drip-dry.
It's OK.
I'm thrilled.
I hated my clothes.
I need new clothes.
They didn't take them, Ma.
You hid them.
Now, where are your clothes?
Maybe I buried them.
What I can't understand is why they didn't take my Chinese vase.
- Who would want it?
- Ma!
You know why this happened?
Because we're without men.
- What?
- I don't know what happens or why.
All I know is, when I had a husband, I didn't worry.
Maybe nothing happened to me because I had a husband, and maybe not.
All I know is, when the lights went out at night, I wasn't afraid.
- It's karma.
- I beg your pardon?
Crime is caused by karma.
Some people give out an energy that attracts misfortune.
They become victims.
It must've been one of you.
I certainly don't have that kind of energy.
'Course, I lost my mama's jewels because of somebody else's energy.
I got no energy.
I'm going to sleep.
Blanche, come on.
Don't be absurd.
Look, we were robbed, and now it's over.
It has nothing to do with energy.
It has nothing to do with being single.
It has to do with a lousy lock on a sliding door and massive unemployment.
I'm going into my room.
Call me when the cops come.
We're all employed, Dorothy, except your mother.
I wouldn't call that "massive.
" Good night, Rose.
Go to sleep, sweetheart.
Pray for brains.
This is not the end.
I can promise you that.
Justice will be done here.
I hate criminals.
I just hate 'em.
Someone's gonna pay for this heinous crime!
We're gonna have a good, old-fashioned hangin'.
That's right, a hangin'.
Only first we'll have a whippin', and then we'll have a hangin'.
Nobody takes my mama's jewels without swingin' for it!
Nighty-night.
So those are the facts, ladies.
It's not a pretty picture.
One out of every three people will be the victim of a violent crime.
- That's awful!
- And since there are four of you, that means at least one of you will be a victim of a violent crime.
One of you right here.
And I read that one out of every three people will get cancer.
That means one of us will get cancer.
So that takes care of two of us.
Oh, knock it off.
Now, we'll take the basic security package, OK?
- How much did you say it would be?
- $600.
- Fine, we'll take it.
- It's better than nothing, but not much.
What do you mean?
For $600, you get a siren that your neighbors ignore.
But with our deluxe system, an armed guard is here within five minutes.
I want something that electrocutes an intruder.
How much more is the deluxe system?
We're talking about the difference between being here in the morning, or being steak tartare.
- How much more?
- A bit more.
- How much?
- Exactly?
- Yes.
- $10,000.
I'd rather be murdered!
I want a great, big wall safe.
You don't need one anymore.
You got no jewelry.
I'll get it back.
I went to the police today with some sketches I made.
How could you make sketches?
You didn't see the robbers.
Not of the robbers, of my mama's jewels.
- OK, OK, we're getting the basic system.
- Whatever.
- But not from you.
From your competitor.
- What?
Because what you were trying to do was terrify us into spending more money than we have.
Now get out of here, before the victim of violent crime in this house is you!
- He scared me to death!
- Oh, me, too.
He scared me too, but you want to know something?
It could be worse.
I mean, we could each be alone.
At least we're together.
We have each other.
- It's better with men.
- Oh, that's false security.
No, it's not.
I was safer with Charles.
I was never once robbed or murdered when I was with Charles.
Yyou could have just as easily have been murdered living with Charles.
I'm surprised she wasn't murdered by Charles.
With George, when I'd hear a noise, I'd wake him up, and then he'd take out his gun.
Then he'd have to find the bullets, because I'd always hide the bullets.
And then, when he found the bullets, we'd make love.
Boy, can you tell a story.
I'm starved.
Come on, let's make dinner.
Oh, I'm not really all that hungry.
- I forgot all about him.
- Yeah, you go on in there.
- Getting a guard dog was your idea.
- I'm afraid of large dogs.
When I was three, I was attacked by a cocker spaniel.
A cocker spaniel's not a large dog.
To a three-year-old it is.
We've got a guard dog in the kitchen.
Great, the food is safe!
I know what we can do.
Let's go out to dinner, my treat.
What about breakfast and lunch?
Look, I'm calling the kennel to come get him.
I've got a date tonight and no jewelry to wear.
Some scum's woman is wearing my mama's jewelry.
I wonder if jewelry comes from Jewish people.
In Little Falls, the jewelry was Jewish.
Jeweler, Jewish I wonder if there's a connection?
I think there's a connection between your brain and wallpaper paste.
I don't know why people even have dogs at all.
I don't like anything in my house that doesn't know how to use the toilet.
- See ya.
- Oh, no, Sophia!
- No, Sophia!
Dorothy!
- Dorothy!
- Dorothy!
Oh!
- What, what?
- Oh, God, I don't know how to tell you - What?
- Oh, it's about your mother!
- Ma?
My God, the dog - I think he ate your mother.
- Ma!
- Some attack dog.
He hid under the table, peed on the floor, and ran out the back.
Oh, give me that!
I thought I was gonna die.
I swear, I have never felt such agony.
I saw my entire life flash before my eyes, and I thought, "What a shame if I die now.
I'm too young.
" And I'm wearing the wrong underwear.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
I'm sorry, it's just me.
I had to get in quickly 'cause when I got out of the car, I noticed a swarthy man with a weapon.
- Swarthy man with a weapon?
- What are you doing?
Buenos dias.
Fernando.
The gardener, trimming the hedge.
- I was running, he was blurred - Ohh - Oh, no!
Blanche has been attacked!
- Sort of.
Oh, honey, what happened, you poor darling?
I went to the police station today to get an update on my case.
I borrowed your pocket hairspray.
I took it from your dressing table.
You know what this humidity does to my hair.
I know - cotton candy.
Well, just as I entered the police station, I saw there was this cute officer there who's had his eye on me, so I took out your hairspray and gave my hair a final spritz.
Only, surprise, it wasn't hairspray.
It was mace.
You had mace.
Your hairspray was mace.
I maced myself right there in the police station!
I almost died.
I fell to the floor blinded, writhing in pain.
Couldn't move for 20 minutes.
Well, what do you know?
It works!
Works?
They thought I was on angel dust.
They wanted to arrest me!
I'm lyin' there dyin' and they're harassing me.
Murderers are free, rapists are free, but a poor widow on the floor they try to lock up.
Who'd I hurt?
Me?
Now, look, Rose.
This is it.
We have had it!
- No mace, no tear gas, no grenades!
- No jewelry.
I won't be needing mace.
I just bought a gun.
You don't know how to use a gun!
The man at the gun store taught me.
In the basement, they've got a little shooting gallery, kind of like the ones at amusement parks.
Except no prizes.
And you shoot at little paper targets.
This was mine.
- Honey, there are no holes in it.
- I know!
That's because they're all in your head.
Now, listen.
I cannot live in a house with a gun.
Dorothy, don't overreact.
Rose, good.
- You get a gun, you kill 'em!
- Yeah.
Kill 'em.
We'll have a dead gardener.
Now, listen, Rose, this has gone too far.
You are going overboard.
Now, I think you need to see someone.
Dorothy, I don't think a date is necessarily the answer.
I meant a psychiatrist, hot pants.
Now, what do you say, Rose?
- Come on, honey, we'll all go.
- You think I'm crazy.
No, I don't but I do think you need help.
I mean, you don't eat, you don't sleep, you're afraid all the time.
You've got nothing to fear but fear itself and, of course, the boogeyman.
I always heard psychiatrists could read your mind, but he didn't do that.
Because there's nothing in your mind to read.
Ma!
Anyway, I liked him.
He was very understanding.
Pay me $85, I'll be understanding and make you marble cake!
- And he liked me.
- Oh, Blanche, how do you know that?
Because he kept saying, "Blanche, how do you feel"?
I wanted to say, "Wouldn't you just like to know, big boy"?
I hate psychiatrists.
They blame everything on the mothers.
- Sophia, he didn't blame you.
- You heard what he said - "We're afraid because our mothers taught us to be afraid.
" For survival, Ma.
They had to.
I mean, what's a mother supposed to say?
"Don't be afraid of strangers.
Eat their candy.
Get into their cars"?
- He made me feel better.
- Me, too.
I was just thrilled to be out of there.
He had two dead fish in his tank.
Of course, your speech endorsing public beheadings with no trial, I think got him a little concerned.
I know.
He wants to see me again, but I think it's personal.
In my day, we didn't have therapy.
We were too busy looking for food.
Looking for food?
You mean, to take back to your cave?
Rose, your father was a dairy farmer.
You looked for food in your freezer.
The psychiatrist didn't make me feel better.
I feel better that you all feel better, but I don't feel any better.
- Not even a little?
- No.
In fact, I feel worse.
- Why worse?
- He was my last hope.
I've got to get some sleep.
I have to get up soon.
Good night, everybody.
- Good night, honey.
- Good night?
Boy, we really have a problem.
I know.
The police are doing nothing about my jewels.
Not that!
There is a woman in there so terrified something is going to happen at night - that she sleeps only in the daytime.
- I know.
Then at sunset, she makes a big pot of coffee and sits up all night with that gun.
It's better than having that dog as long as she doesn't wet the floor.
You shot my vase!
I heard footsteps and a man's voice and the alarm went off!
It was Lester.
He accidentally set off the alarm!
- Oh, I'm sorry!
- You shot my vase!
- I didn't shoot Lester.
- I'd rather you shot Lester.
- I think I'll pass on the nightcap, Blanche.
- Go on home, you old fool.
- What happened?
- She shot my vase!
Thank God.
I hated that thing.
What are you doing shooting?
Are you crazy?
I heard a noise.
I thought it was the robbers.
I manage to live 80, 81 years.
I survive pneumonia, two operations, a stroke One night, I'll belch and Stable Mable here will blow my head off!
Rose, you've got to do something.
This is crippling you!
Just save whatever pieces you find.
I can glue it back together.
You bet - whatever I find.
I love that vase.
Rose, you cannot go on this way.
Life isn't worth living if you're gonna live it with this kind of fear.
Now, honey, we were robbed.
It's scary, but it happens.
And now it's over, and the robbers are gone.
I know.
I know that.
I know it's over.
I know they're gone, but not for me!
For me, in my mind, they'll always be here!
Oh, honey.
Oh, dear God.
Lady, wait!
Hey, lady!
Three and one is four, and ten is 14.
And a double letter score is 18, 19, 20, 23.
And a triple word score makes a total of 69 points.
I win.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
- There is no such word as that.
- There certainly is.
Fine.
I'll look it up, and if it isn't in the dictionary, I win.
- We don't have a dictionary.
- Yes, we do.
Not anymore.
The robbers took it.
They stole our dictionary?
That's right.
Too bad.
Ma, "disdam" is not a word.
You made it up.
- It's a word.
- Fine.
Use it in a sentence.
"You're no good at disdam game.
" They caught them.
They caught the scum.
- That's wonderful!
- It is for you.
They found your stole.
- They didn't find my jewels.
- Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
They can sell my jewelry, you see.
It's worth somethin'.
Who would want that thing?
Nobody wears stoles anymore.
My mama's jewels, out there on the black market, being fondled by filth.
I just can't wait to testify in court.
I want to see those guys fry.
Well, everybody, you will never guess what I did today.
- What?
- I was in this parking garage.
I had to go to the dentist 'cause I lost my crown in a nectarine.
There was no parking on the street.
There I was, all alone.
- I heard footsteps.
- Ooh.
It was my nightmare come true.
Someone was after me.
I ran, he ran.
I ran faster, he ran faster.
- No!
- He grabbed my arm, and I turned around and dropped him.
Kneed him right in his safe-deposit box.
Dropped him like a sack of potatoes.
He lay on the ground, and he was writhing and groaning and screaming in agony.
And I stood over him, and I looked at this pitiable creature, and I thought, "I can take care of myself"!
I'm not helpless.
I'm gonna be OK!
- Oh, honey, that's wonderful!
- Oh, honey, that's fantastic!
I have faith again.
Kill the killers!
- This calls for champagne.
I'll get it.
- Honey, there's none on ice.
I'll put some in the freezer.
So what happens now?
I guess you press charges, right?
Well, no.
No, actually not.
- He might press charges, though.
- Why?
You see, the guy that was moaning and screaming and groaning in agony was the parking attendant.
He was coming after me because I'd forgot to pick up my keys.
But I'm not afraid anymore!
I know that when it comes right down to it, I can take care of myself.
Oh, honey, I always knew you could.
- Oh, damn.
- What?
- My jewelry - Oh, please, Blanche.
- Enough with your jewelry!
- No, I found it.
- What?
- It was in the freezer!
- Oh, Blanche, that's wonderful!
- It was there all the time?
If you'd had your way, the robbers would've been beheaded.
That doesn't matter.
The point is, they stole your stole.
A beautiful stole.
You can't replace it.
They don't make 'em anymore.
Look here
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Ma, where are you going with all that food?
I'm stashing it away from Rose's mother.
She's on a special diet.
I hate those people.
You turn your back for a second, boom boom, your food is gone.
Anything on your plate is suddenly on their diet.
Oh, come on, Ma.
You haven't even met Rose's mother.
I know a lot of old people.
They're all the same.
They're cranky, they're demanding, they repeat themselves, they're cranky, they're demanding Ma, what makes you think she's old?
She's the same age as you.
So how come she ordered her a wheelchair at the airport, a special meal on the plane, and put an oxygen tank in the garage?
Maybe she's a disabled welder on a special diet.
Ma, I want you to be nice to her.
Maybe you can even show her some of the sights.
-  - That must be them.
Well, thanks again for the ride home, Dirk.
I'll see you at Tuesday's Jazzercise class?
- I'll see you then.
- OK.
Unless I see you before then.
If you wouldn't mind, maybe we could go out.
Why, Dirk, did I just hear you ask me for a date?
Are you deaf?
I heard him from here.
You think maybe we could have dinner Saturday night?
Why don't I just check my datebook and I'll let you know.
- Sure.
I'll call you tomorrow.
- OK.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Well, isn't this an interesting turn of events?
Gosh, I just don't know what I'm gonna do.
You know, he is a little bit younger than I am.
Watch your step, Mother.
That's a girl!
Oh, Rosie.
I haven't been a girl since 1912.
Why, look who's here!
I want you all to meet my mother, Mrs. Lindstrom.
This is Blanche and this is Dorothy and Sophia.
Very nice to meet you.
Tell me, how was your trip?
It was just fine.
Which one of them is hard of hearing?
No one is, Mother.
We just didn't want you to have to strain to hear us.
But there's nothing wrong with my ears!
Of course there isn't.
Now, you sit right down here and I'll fix you a little snack.
How long will you be visiting with us, Mrs. Lindstrom?
Only a week.
Then she's off to Houston to see my brother.
Is your name Mrs. Lindstrom?
How would you like a little tour of our home while Rose is fixing that snack?
I don't think this is a good time for that.
Mother's had a big day and I don't want her to get overtired.
Well, she can skip the east wing, Rose.
Well, maybe tomorrow.
Why don't you take a little nap while I fix you something to eat.
Rosie!
I'm not a child.
I don't need a nap!
There's nothing wrong with taking a nap.
Bob Hope takes naps.
Unless he's in the bedroom now, taking one, I think she'd rather stay here with us.
Sophia, please.
I know what's best for my mother.
Come on, honey.
Let's get you unpacked.
Right down there.
Seems like a very nice lady.
Yeah.
Too bad Rose won't get off her back.
You know, I think I can handle this relationship with Dirk.
- I'm going out with him Saturday night.
- Was there ever any doubt?
Momentarily.
This is strictly off the record, but Dirk's nearly five years younger than I am.
In what, Blanche, dog years?
However, I have decided to overlook that minor detail and succumb to the Vesuvius of passion that is about to erupt from me.
Stand back.
We're gonna get something on us.
I am talking about what's happening between Dirk and me.
It's something really special, something fragile and rare.
I've only felt this once before.
It was during my 17th summer and I was working behind the cosmetics counter at the Rexall drugstore.
I was stocking the Maybelline display when I heard this booming voice say, "Excuse me, ma'am.
Where are the cuticle scissors"?
I turned around and there he was.
Our eyes locked, and for one brief moment, there was nobody else on earth but the two of us.
Please, Blanche.
Sidney Sheldon tells shorter stories!
I know in my heart, if I'd just followed my feelings that day at the Rexall drugstore, today I would be Mrs. Andy Griffith!
I'm not gonna make the same mistake with Dirk that I made with Andy.
Didn't she tell us that story before?
Yes, but the last time it was Woolworth's, a toenail clipper, and John Cameron Swayze.
Inhale.
Good!
Exhale and lean back.
Hold your position.
Keep breathing.
The only time I get in that position is when I give birth.
Oh!
- Aah, my back!
- Are you all right?
No, but it's worth it.
No pain, no gain.
Gotta look good for Dirk.
A man his age is used to a trim body with good tone.
Then buy him a Princess phone.
What are you doing now?
I'm taking my bee pollen and my sheep's liver extract, and my fish oil protein.
I'm getting younger with each passing day!
Great.
When they defrost Walt Disney, he'll have someone to go out with.
Go ahead, make fun.
These treatments are working.
Oh, come on, Blanche.
Now think about it for a minute.
If you feel you have to go through all of this, what kind of a relationship can this possibly be?
A youthful relationship.
A relationship that I want.
Dorothy, Dirk is the youngest man I've ever dated.
If I'm gonna keep him, I've got to give it all I got.
Now if you'll excuse me, I've got some road work to do.
- Hi, Blanche.
You look terrific.
- Thanks!
Blanche looks terrible.
She looks terrible because all she eats is bee pollen.
I know!
Isn't it ironic that the bees look so good?
- What are you doing home?
- I came home early to be with Mother.
- No, my mother took her to the track.
- You let her out of the house?
No, she dug a tunnel out of her bedroom with a dessert spoon.
Oh, my Lord!
She's out on the street and it's almost dark!
Honey, she's fine.
She's with my mother.
Oh, Sophia's different, Dorothy.
She's, she's, she's your mother.
My mother's led a very quiet life.
All this is gonna be too much for her.
Come on, honey.
She's out betting on the horses, not rounding them up.
Hello?
Anyone home?
Oh, Mother, are you all right?
She's fine.
I'm 50 bucks in the hole.
Look, Rose!
I won $400!
I told you she was all right.
Congratulations, Alma.
Mom, I'll be in the living room in case you decide to explain where you got the $50 that you just lost.
Sophia, what time does that mall close?
I feel like getting wild!
I'll buy you some of that bikini underwear.
Nah, it rides up on me.
You've had enough for one day.
Sit down and I'll bring you a nice cup of tea.
I don't want a cup of tea, I want to go out and have fun!
Mother, you know how you get when you get tired.
You're liable to lose your balance and break a hip.
That's exactly how it happened the last time.
Rosie, I broke my hip ice skating!
Do you want to go back to the hospital?
Did you have fun the last time?
I had more fun than I'm having here with you.
Mother!
Stop mothering me!
You make me sorry I came!
Come on, Rose.
You just checked the door two minutes ago.
I thought I heard something.
I should never have let them go shopping.
- It's too dangerous.
- What are you talking about?
Just this morning, I read where 1400 people were injured in a food riot in Calcutta.
Oh, Sophia, thank goodness you're home!
Where's Mother?
She was feeling lucky so she wanted to try her hand at jai-alai.
- Why didn't you go with her?
- I'm too short to play jai-alai.
Sophia, you left my mother alone, roaming through a strange city?
Who's roaming?
She has a bus map, $400, and a Spanish/English dictionary.
I can't believe my mother's out riding around on a smelly old bus, bing pushed around, harassed, possibly even mugged by hostile teenagers with bad haircuts.
You are overreacting!
Come on now.
Your mother is not a helpless little girl.
She is an active, vital woman - who can take care of herself.
-  I'll get that.
Hello?
Yes, this is she.
Oh, my Lord!
- What is it?
- I understand.
I'll be right down.
- What's wrong?
- That was the police.
What's the matter?
Is it your mother?
Is she all right?
She's fine.
She's at the police station.
They picked up my vital, active mother.
She was lost and disoriented.
What do you say to that?
Oh, come on now.
Calm down, Rose.
- I have to go.
- I'm gonna go with you.
No, thanks.
You've been quite enough help already.
Well, I hope Alma's all right.
Don't worry about Alma.
She's a tough old broad.
Dorothy, look at me.
I have turned back the hands of time.
Since Dirk asked me out, I've dropped ten years.
Why, my face is smooth, my body is taut, and my gears are grinding.
No matter what you do to your face, your body, or your gears, you are still your age.
Of course you are.
Gravity always takes its toll.
Look at me!
I used to be a tall, voluptuous blonde with a butt like granite.
When Dirk looks at me, you think he sees an old woman?
No, he sees a young, vibrant, passionate contemporary.
Blanche, you haven't even been out with him yet.
But my instincts are infallible in this.
Believe me, I know men.
- No arguments here.
-  -  Mother, please!
I told you, Rose.
They had no right to take me in!
I merely flagged a policeman to ask for directions, and before I knew it, he dragged me to the police station.
He was only trying to help you, Mother.
And you had the gall to scold me like a child in front of all those people!
There's no point in trying to talk to you when you feel like this.
After a good night's sleep, you won't be so testy.
- We'll discuss this in the morning.
- I won't be here in the morning.
- What?
- I'm leaving early for Houston.
I'll certainly have a much better time at your brother's.
I'm gonna help her pack.
Then I'll see if I can win some of that Oh, Rose, honey.
Come on, she's just angry.
I'm sure she didn't mean it.
How can she talk to me like that?
I'm only trying to take care of her.
Honey, can I talk to you as one daughter to another?
Do you remember way back when we were teenagers?
What was the one thing that we wanted most from our mothers?
A training bra?
Honey, the thing we wanted most was to be treated as adults.
But then as we get older, we turn right around and start treating our mothers like little girls.
All your mother wants to do is be treated like a woman.
Is that asking too much?
Hmm?
I got a jack!
You got a queen.
OK, I owe you 40 bucks.
Sophia, could you excuse us?
If I've got to go now, I don't owe you anything.
- Who says?
- House rules.
OK.
Mother, am I really making you miserable?
Yes, you are.
I know you don't mean to, but you are.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I Won't you stay and give me another chance?
I don't know, Rosie.
I know I drive you crazy, but it's just because I love you so much.
You know, after Daddy died, I just thought I'd never get over it.
And Charlie Well, there's not a day goes by that I don't think about him.
And now that you're getting older, I'm afraid I'm gonna lose you, too.
That's why I fuss over you so much.
I understand, Rosie, but stopping me from living isn't going to stop me from dying.
- Oh, I can't stand to think about it!
- Well, then, don't.
Let's just enjoy what we have.
Easy, easy, Ma!
That's my best china.
You got it for me when I got married, you remember?
Who could forget?
I carried it all the way from Sicily!
And for what?
So you could get divorced.
I should have gotten you something returnable, like a donkey.
You know, I've eaten through a lot of great times on these plates.
Yeah.
You know, with Alma here, I've been thinking a lot about the two of us.
Oh, what do you mean?
The one thing you never do is treat me like an old lady.
You treat me like a person.
I appreciate that.
You're a good daughter, Dorothy.
Ma, I'm overwhelmed.
I don't know what to say.
I'll tell you what you could say.
You could say I don't owe you the $50.
Ma, you are a crazy lady, and I love ya, I love ya, I love ya.
I love you too, pussycat.
Yes, I believe I will have the escargot and the duck a I'orange and a nice tossed salad with the blue cheese dressing.
I'll have the watercress salad with two lemon wedges, please.
Oh, that sounds great.
I didn't even see that on my menu!
I'll have the same thing.
- Isn't this a lovely place?
- Mm-hmm.
- It's one of my favorite restaurants.
- I'm into macrobiotics, myself.
I am, too.
I just like this atmosphere.
What did you do before you got into teaching aerobics?
I worked in a museum.
You're kidding me!
I work at a museum!
I love art!
Me too!
I love lifting it.
I beg your pardon?
I used to unload the trucks.
And I don't know why, but lifting those statues really helped develop my deltoids.
See.
Yes, that's fascinating.
Put that down, honey.
Read any good books lately?
Pumping Iron.
I saw the movie, too, but I don't think it did the book justice.
How could it?
I really like being with you.
Well, thank you, Dirk.
I like the way you sound and the way you look.
- Why, thank you, Dirk.
- You remind me of my mother.
She lives in Seattle and I haven't seen her in three years.
But when I'm with you, I kind of feel like I'm home with Mom.
Waiter!
I'll have the orange duck and a double Jack Daniel's on the rocks.
Come on, one more hand.
I'm tired, Sophia.
I'd like to cash in.
Now, lets see, these are worth a dollar a piece.
I have 20 to 30 pretzel sticks here.
Now you got pretzel dust.
Come on, Ma, don't be a sore loser.
Now, you owe her $30.
You're absolutely right, Dorothy.
I stand corrected.
Pay her.
Gee, it's getting late.
I wonder how Blanche's date is going.
Yeah, I'm getting a little worried.
Me too.
I don't feel comfortable with her dating a younger man.
I'm not concerned about her dating a younger man.
- It's just that her expectations are so high.
- You mean you approve?
Well, why not?
I mean, what's so terrible?
I did it once.
You?
You dated a younger man?
Yes, Rose.
Of course, it was before I had the hump on my back.
Personally, I don't see anything wrong with dating a younger man.
The three years I had with Ben were some of the happiest of my life.
Mother!
After Daddy died and you kids moved out, there was just no way I could handle the place by myself.
So I hired a farmhand.
He was such a nice young man.
He raved about my cooking.
I guess they didn't feed him very well in prison.
Anyway, we just loved being with each other.
Of course, it was a particularly Ionely time for me and it was nice to have someone to talk to.
And after awhile, he moved in.
I don't think I could have gotten through those years without Ben.
But when it was over, it was over.
But we were both better off for having known each other.
Mother, how could you?
A drifter?
An ex-con?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I, I you said he made you happy, that's what matters.
Yeah, he was probably very nice for a drifting ex-con.
Thank you, Rosie.
I think I will go to bed now.
Good night.
- Good night, Alma.
- I'll go with ya.
I'll bring the cards.
Can I ask you a personal question, Alma?
Did this Ben teach you how to gamble?
He taught me how to play cards and how to carve a pistol out of soap.
Do you think our kids will want us around when we're their age?
Oh, Rose.
They don't want us now.
Oh, I don't want to talk about it.
What's the matter?
What happened?
Oh, my date with Dirk was a disaster.
He was looking for a mother, not a lover.
It was humiliating.
- I think it's sweet.
- You would, Betty Crocker.
Oh, I'm sorry, Rose.
I'm just a little depressed.
For the first time in my life, I feel over 40.
- You know why that is, honey?
- Why?
Because you're over 50.
Don't I know it.
Over 50 and over the hill!
Oh, come on, Blanche.
Age is just a state of mind.
Tell that to my thighs.
I feel awful.
I don't want to go on.
No, I can't stand it!
I cannot stand it!
Well, I can't, either!
Listen, you have your looks, your health.
You have a couple bucks in the bank and friends who love you.
That's a hell of a lot more than most people have.
I won't sit here and listen to you feeling sorry for yourself and neither is Rose.
Yeah.
She's right.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" -  Bye-bye.
- Bye, y'all.
And drive carefully.
This wind is terrible.
- See you next week.
- Bye!
Goodbye!
- Oh!
- Oh, what a party!
Oh, Ma, I tell you, that meal was absolutely incredible.
Oh, it was fantastic, Sophia, really fantastic.
I know, I know.
- Did you see that Emma Jane eat?
- Oh!
I could not believe my eyes!
That woman must weigh 275 pounds.
She never stopped shoving it in.
And then she had to talk the entire time.
She just sprayed food all over the table, like a mist!
I got it in my hair.
It was hitting me like pellets.
I got a piece of rice in my eye.
She could have put my eye out.
Well, I never had food like that in my life.
Now, I spent a summer in Italy four years ago.
I never ate this well.
'Course, I never ate.
Who'd have the time or the energy, if you get my drift.
- No.
- Oh, Rose.
Italian men are just the sexiest, most romantic, most gorgeous men in the world.
Of course they worshipped me because I'm blonde and feminine and young, with a great body.
What mirror do you use?
Oh, Sophia, now, you've done enough.
Girls, we're doing the dishes.
You just sit.
Fine with me.
I'm exhausted.
I've been cooking for two days.
I offered to help you, Sophia, but you said "no".
You're Scandinavian.
What do you know, a thousand ways to make herring?
Well, not a thousand, but a lot, and I'm famous for my Lindstrom surprise.
- What in the world is that?
- Herring pie.
The surprise is, you think it's pie, like apple, but when you bite into it, it's herring!
Oh, what fun!
It was.
My cat was named Lindstrom.
I used to make it for him on his birthday and other holidays.
Wait, your last name was Lindstrom.
You named your cat Lindstrom Lindstrom?
Yes, it was less confusing for him.
I'm gonna clear the stuff from inside.
- She's something.
- A real pistol.
The energy she has - look at this meal she made.
It's just incredible.
You know, she's starting to clear up.
We can't let her do that.
Oh, you're right.
Come on.
She's done enough for one night.
- Ma, now listen - Oh, boy.
I ate too much scungilli.
- What's the matter?
- I got a bubble.
- Why are you rubbing your chest?
- The bubble is in my chest.
What do you mean, you have a bubble?
Is it pain?
If it was pain, I'd call it pain.
I have a bubble.
Blanche, do you know what a bubble is?
I know what a bauble is.
I know what it is.
I've had a bubble.
In your head.
A bubble is something that just sits there and presses until it's chased away by a you-know-what.
No.
What, Rose, a highway patrolman?
- Dorothy.
- What?
A big belch.
You couldn't say "belch"?
What is it, a Viking curse?
Well, it's not the nicest word in the world.
Right now, it would be the nicest sound in the world.
Ma, you know, you don't look good.
I'm short and I'm old.
What did you expect, Princess Di?
- I think we should call the doctor.
- I don't need a doctor!
Blanche, would you call, please?
The number's by my bed - Dr. Harris.
I hate doctors.
The only doctor I ever liked was Dr. Clyde, our vet.
He was wonderful.
My mother wanted him to do her hysterectomy, but he wouldn't.
But he was willing to do her lobotomy.
Ooh!
- What, Ma?
What?
- Pain.
- What kind of pain?
- The kind that hurts.
- Ma, lie down.
Just lie down.
- What if I'm having a heart attack?
- You're not having a heart attack.
- How do you know?
You're not a doctor.
Why do you think you're having a heart attack?
I'm 80 years old, I got Pavarotti sitting on my chest, odds are it's a heart attack!
The doctor was out.
They're trying to locate him, so I called the paramedics - and they're on the way.
- Oh, great.
Dorothy, do we have heart disease in our family?
- No, Ma.
- How did Uncle Mario die?
Don't you remember?
He was carrying out the garbage and dropped his gun, and it went off and shot him in the forehead.
Oh, yeah, right.
What a klutz.
Didn't Aunt Teresa have a heart attack?
Aunt Teresa didn't have a heart.
Uncle Nunzio?
Uncle Nunzio died to get away from Aunt Teresa.
My mother died of old age and my father fell off a donkey, - so we got healthy hearts in our family.
- Very, very healthy.
That's good.
That's a good thing.
There shouldn't be heart attacks or cancer, or anything like that.
There should just be a certain age where you have to turn your life in, like a library book.
You pack a bag, you go, and that's that.
I wouldn't know what to pack.
The real question is, do they have dry cleaners there?
Oh, dry cleaners die.
There's probably a slew of dry cleaners.
- Will you two please shut up?
- Oh!
I'm s - How about if I make coffee?
- Great.
Good idea.
Thanks, Blanche.
- Rose.
- Oh, I'll come help.
- What if I die, Dorothy?
- Ma, you're not going to die.
Now, look.
I don't want you to talk, just rest.
Rest?
I could be history in 20 minutes.
I got some things I have to tell you.
- The key to my safe-deposit box - Oh, Ma, please!
Don't interrupt.
Don't let your Aunt Renata come to the services.
It's my death.
She'll make it her moment.
- Ma, look - Dorothy, you were always my favorite.
I want you to know that.
Maybe I didn't show it.
I'm not an affectionate person.
But you are.
Don't tell your sister, and keep the silver.
OK, Ma.
You know, I'll probably see your father in heaven.
I haven't seen him in 30 years.
I wish there was time to get my hair done.
Maybe it isn't a heart attack.
She's 80.
At 80, something's got to go.
Well, not necessarily.
My grandparents lived till their 90s.
One was 102.
- In Minnesota.
- So?
Rose, you know how they freeze dead people to preserve them and then bring them back?
That's like living in Minnesota.
The cold slows down the aging process.
I would move there in a shot if only they had men there.
We have men in Minnesota.
Farmers, Rose.
Farmers.
- I'm an idiot!
- Why?
- I didn't think this would happen.
- What?
Death.
I didn't really think I'd die.
Ma, maybe someday, but not today.
It could be today, and you know what?
I'm not ready.
as a complete surprise.
Ma, you're OK.
You are not going to die.
- I don't want to.
- Who does?
You know, I'd settle for even just one more day.
God knows why.
Tomorrow I'm cleaning the closets.
- Ma, I love you.
- You know what, Dorothy?
- What?
- Death sucks.
- Do you want to be buried or cremated?
- Neither.
What do you want to be, flushed down the toilet like a goldfish?
I wouldn't want to be cremated.
I hate heat.
And burial?
I hate small spaces.
I'm a little claustrophobic.
Rose, you're not gonna know anything.
You're gonna be dead.
Oh.
Well, then, burial, I guess.
But will you promise to put a blanket in with me?
- Why?
- Oh, I'd just feel more comfortable cozier.
And I'd want my pictures of Charlie and the animals.
You know, the ones in the little silver frames.
And-And my pictures of the children.
And, of course, if I'm married again, I'd want a picture of my new husband.
- And the candlesticks Mama gave me - Rose, it's a coffin, not a condo.
This is a very depressing conversation.
Well, I want a fancy funeral.
I want a big parade with a riderless horse.
And I want to lie in state, and then be buried in Arlington Cemetery.
- Why Arlington Cemetery?
- Because it's full of men.
- But they're all dead.
- So are the men I date.
And I'm sorry I never tried acting.
I always wanted to act.
- Coffee's ready.
- Oh, thanks, Blanche.
Sophia, you feeling a little better?
- Oh, my God, she's - I'm not dead, I'm resting.
- Of course you're not dead.
- Not yet.
- Oh, Ma.
- Don't "Ma" me.
Listen.
Before you know it, I could be gone, and we won't have said some important stuff.
I love you, Dorothy.
Just remember that I love you very, very much.
And I love you, Ma very, very much.
I couldn't love you more.
And you two, Heckle and Jeckle.
Thank you for letting me live here.
It was some treat.
You made an old lady feel young again.
You're OK.
- We love you, Sophia.
- We sure do.
This is nice, to die with friends.
I'm gonna close my eyes now, but I'm only resting.
Oh God, where are the paramedics?
I'll go call them again.
Rose, you stay with Dorothy.
Oh, Dorothy, she'll be fine.
I'm sure it isn't a heart attack.
A heart attack's bigger.
I've seen a heart attack.
Charlie had a heart attack.
- And it wasn't like this?
- Oh, it was much worse.
If only the paramedics would get here.
Charlie made me dress him when he had his heart attack, before the paramedics got there.
What, he wasn't dressed?
We were making love.
Oh, Rose, honey, you never told me.
He died while you were making love?
He didn't die then.
He had his heart attack then and he told me to dress him.
- And?
- And I dressed him.
And then we had a fight.
I grabbed a pair of white pants and I was putting them on him, and Charlie said it was after Labor Day and he couldn't wear white.
In the middle of a heart attack?
Oh, Charlie was very stubborn and very dapper.
And then what happened?
And he told me he loved me and then it was over.
And I put a pair of gray flannel pants on him and a blue shirt, and striped tie.
And he was all dressed when the paramedics got there.
Girls, come here a minute.
Listen, it's gonna be awhile.
There's lots of trees down and accidents because of the storm, so the paramedics can't get through right away.
Oh, we have to do something.
I mean, she needs help.
- We can drive her.
- That's right.
The hospital's 20 minutes from here.
If the paramedics can't get through, what makes you think we can?
We could get out there and get stuck.
- I think we ought to just wait for help.
- But she could be dying!
But what can we do?
Pray.
Wait and pray.
Aah!
What, Ma?
What?
What?
You're sitting on top of me, I open my eyes, I see pores like that, I think I'm on the moon.
Did you have a nice nap, Sophia?
I didn't have a nap.
I died a little.
I went to heaven.
Oh, Ma.
You just slept, is all.
You were there?
Don't tell me where I went.
I went to heaven.
I saw the golden light and some angels in white robes with harps.
I thought I was in Saks at Christmas, but then I saw your father.
- Really?
- He was surrounded by women.
He's in heaven.
- Did you see God and Jesus?
- They were busy.
- I think I'll go back.
- Ma, don't go.
No, Dorothy.
It's a wonderful place.
- I'm very excited about it.
- Ma, I want you here.
Sophia, are there lots of men in heaven?
- Oh, Blanche.
- I'd like to know.
Dorothy, get me my rosary.
I'll be right back.
Listen, Sophia.
What about men?
Are there lots of men in heaven?
- Oh, Blanche, come on!
- You asked her about God and Jesus.
Is there anything else we can get you, Sophia?
A little tea, perhaps?
I'm not in England.
I'm having a heart attack.
Keep her company.
I'm gonna help Dorothy.
Sophia, you know, I always thought there'd be a Catholic heaven, with nuns and priests and churches.
And then a separate, Protestant heaven, with people and cows and horses.
And then a Jewish heaven, with libraries and furriers and You're starting to annoy me.
You shouldn't annoy a sick person.
Oh Sophia, I'm sorry.
I'm just trying to help.
You want to help?
Be quiet.
I'll be quiet, but just don't close your eyes all right?
Don't-Don't close your eyes.
- Did you find them?
- No.
Ooh, Blanche, what if she dies?
She's a tough lady, Dorothy.
If anyone's a survivor, she is.
If she dies, I'll be an orphan.
Can you believe it?
I'm over 50 years old, and I'll still feel like an orphan.
I know.
Oh, it doesn't matter.
You lose a parent, you might as well be six.
It's scary, and it pushes you right up to the head of the line.
I know.
Oh, God, I don't know what I'll do.
I love that lady so much.
She's my family.
We're your family too, Dorothy, and you remember that.
We might not be blood, but we're here.
Oh God, I miss her already.
So there I was with no vet, and Petunia was about to give birth to her piglets.
Well, I just didn't know what to do.
I mean, I had helped deliver Bessie the cow, but Petunia was so much more difficult.
She- If I died, would you stop telling this story?
Sophia, I'm sorry.
I was just trying to get your mind off things.
I want my mind on things.
I've got to make my peace, and I need some peace to do it.
- I'll be quiet.
- Thank you.
Here are your beads, Ma.
I found them in a can of peanut brittle.
Of course.
That's where I keep them.
-  Oh, no.
Look at what her last meal was.
That is tragic, just tragic.
Here, honey, dig in.
'Course, it will be just my luck.
I'll eat, I'll gain 40 pounds, and live to be 90.
Me, too.
I'm healthy as a horse.
Unfortunately, I'll wind up looking like one.
All it takes is one little dessert and my panties cut off my circulation.
- I pass.
- Me, too.
I'm not touching that.
I put on 12 pounds just from dinner alone.
- Let's go for a walk.
- Right, burn it off.
Are you kidding?
After what we ate, we'd have to walk to Canada.
Oh, Mounties.
I love Canadian men!
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say Thank you for being a friend  - What do you think?
- I can't decide.
Oh, honey, trust me, Martinique is perfect.
It has everything and all the men speak French.
What do the women speak?
- Honey, everybody speaks French.
- Then we can't go there.
- I don't know any French.
- Don't worry.
All you need to know are two phrases - yes, and no, your roommate can't watch.
I was thinking maybe some place like Williamsburg, Virginia.
Or maybe Washington, D.C. You're moving, Rose?
Too bad.
This would be touching if I liked you more.
I'm not moving, Sophia.
The three of us are planning a vacation together.
Without me?
We were hoping that maybe you'd stay here and watch the house.
Why don't you take the house?
I'll stay here and watch the hole in the ground!
Hello, everybody.
Hi, Ma.
Brooke Shields takes her mother everywhere!
- She just found out about our vacation.
- We thought you were gonna tell her.
I was waiting for the right moment.
You know, like right after we landed in New York.
New York?
I want to go to an island.
New York is an island.
No, I mean some place where swarthy men who don't speak English rub oil all over your body.
Great, then we can go for a ride on the subway.
- Stan's here.
- Oh.
What is he doing here?
He needs my signature on some papers so I told him he could stop by.
- Oh.
- Where is he?
I left him on the doorstep.
I wanted the neighbors to see what a bacia-galoop you married.
I'll be back in a minute.
Where is this vacation spot that doesn't allow mothers?
Look, Ma, please.
We'll discuss this after Stan leaves.
What's to discuss?
You're leaving me behind to guard the house like an old watchdog.
I hope a neighbor comes by to give me fresh water.
- Hello, Stan.
- Dorothy, hello.
- You look fantastic.
- Please, please, Stan.
No hugging, no kissing.
Let's just do it and get it over with.
Sounds like the last few years of our marriage.
I wish it was that good.
- It wasn't that bad.
- No, you're right.
The important thing is that it's over.
Come on in.
Hello, Sophia.
So, did you bring the young chippy with you?
Ma, come on, you're talking about his wife.
So did you bring the bimbo?
Chrissy's back in Maui.
I just came to sell a piece of property that Dorothy and I bought when we were in Miami on our honeymoon.
- Just sign on the last page.
- Read it first.
The last time he had you sign something, I ended up in a home.
Relax.
It's just property where Dorothy and I talked about retiring someday.
Wait a minute, Stan.
I can't sign this now.
Oh, come on, babe.
I thought everything was agreed.
But this has to be signed in front of a notary public and don't call me babe.
Darn!
Can you meet me at a notary's tomorrow?
- Do I have a choice?
- You're beautiful.
I'll call you in the morning and make the arrangements.
So long, Sophia!
You're beautiful, too.
- Why did I ever marry that man?
- Because he knocked you up.
- Why did I ever let that happen?
- 'Cause he got you drunk.
Why am I even discussing this with you?
Beats the hell out of me.
You sure all you want is coffee?
The corned beef here is really primo.
No.
I didn't even want the coffee.
You were the one who said it'd be rude if I didn't join you.
Besides, I thought the little woman had you eating things like sprouts and roots and those green things that grow under boats.
Let's not talk about Chrissy.
Oh, come on.
We've had a bitter divorce that time has softened into a hostile relationship.
Face it, our topics of conversation are limited.
Come on.
We just sold a piece of property that we bought on our honeymoon.
Don't you feel a little sentimental?
No.
What do you say we take a drive and take one last look at it?
Oh, two hours in a car with my ex-husband, looking at a piece of swampland that I don't even own anymore Oh, Stan, you really know how to show a girl a good time.
She left me.
- What?
- Chrissy left me for a younger man.
Younger than Chrissy?
Where did she meet him, Camp Snoopy?
I didn't want to say anything.
What the hell, you deserve to gloat a little.
I deserve to gloat a lot!
But I can't.
I know what the pain is like and I wouldn't wish it on I don't know how to finish that sentence - I usually say Stan.
- When did it happen?
- Ah, a couple of months ago.
She told me she thought we were no longer sexually compatible.
She didn't say it exactly in those words.
Of course not.
Those words have more than one syllable.
Anyway, she found a guy with a few less miles on his surfboard and that was that.
Well, I must say, you're taking it fairly well.
It's a front.
You sure you're not going to say "I told you so"?
You're a good person, Dorothy.
- You want some?
- Oh, wonderful!
Half a pound of cholesterol.
Are you sure you don't want to go take a ride and look at our swamp?
Oh, why not?
I mean, the day's shot anyway.
I'll take you to dinner.
How about that seafood place near the Fontainebleau where we were on our honeymoon?
Sure, why not?
If memory serves me correctly, the last time, we excused ourselves before the main course - and rushed back to the hotel.
- Mmm If memory serves me, we rushed back to the hotel because you had the runs from that cheap lunch you bought us.
Oh, yeah.
I don't care what Dorothy says, I'm not spending my vacation in New York.
It might be interesting.
I've never been to New York.
You haven't, Rose?
I'm shocked, you're so cosmopolitan!
Take it from me, you're not missing a thing.
The people are rude, the streets are full of criminals, everything's overpriced.
I don't know why Frank Sinatra sings about it.
New Yorkers are all sickos.
We could go to Hollywood.
Sure, good choice.
No sickos there!
Sophia, please.
We're trying to make a very difficult decision here.
Excuse me!
Not only am I not allowed to go, I'm not allowed to talk about it!
This is the same deal Cinderella had with her stepsisters!
I've always wanted to go to Hollywood.
When I was a young girl, I used to dream about becoming a movie star.
Mr. Mason, who owned the corner drugstore, said I was a young Barbara Billingsley.
So when I turned 17, I told my father that I wanted to take acting lessons.
What did he say?
No.
Great story, Rose.
But you know what?
Hollywood's not a bad idea.
Should we tell Dorothy that we want to go to Hollywood?
Why don't we!
As soon as she gets up!
To Hollywood!
- To Hollywood!
- Morning.
I guess you ladies didn't recognize me without my toupee.
I guess that's it.
Do you mind if I use the phone?
You already used my daughter, you didn't ask for my permission.
- There's a phone in the living room.
- Thanks.
- Hi.
- Hi.
OK, I know what it looks like.
And frankly, that's exactly what it is.
You had to bring him home?
You couldn't find a drunken sailor on a street corner?
We're a little surprised, that's all.
You're not alone.
I mean, it was the last thing in the world I expected.
I met him, we went to sign the papers, we had lunch, he told me his wife left him And you believed him?
That is the oldest line in the book.
- I hear that at least twice a week!
- And it works every time.
I said it was old.
I didn't say it doesn't work.
No, believe me, Chrissy left him.
He was devastated.
Next thing I knew, I was holding him, he was crying, we were in bed.
It was just as it always had been.
- Well, I'm shocked.
- I was too.
You know, Chrissy didn't teach him a thing.
If he's moving in, I'm moving out.
He is not moving in, Ma.
We are not getting back together.
It was just one night with a comfortable stranger and that's where it ends.
Believe me, we both know that.
No, you heard me right.
Six dozen long-stemmed roses.
And the card should read, "To Dorothy and a wonderful new beginning".
We're gonna talk to the travel agent about Hollywood.
- Do you want to come with us?
- No, look, I'm sorry, but I'm not going to spend my vacation sitting in a tour bus, looking at houses that may or may not belong to Lucille Ball.
I'm not spending my vacation in New York getting mugged and groped and insulted.
I'll be happy to go anywhere they don't spit on Americans.
- Why don't you come with us?
- I can't.
Stan called, he's stopping by.
What's he going to do?
Bring you some more flowers?
You know what I don't understand?
I don't understand why he sent you flowers at all.
I mean, two days ago you hated each other.
And you know what else I don't understand?
I don't understand how two people who go off to a business meeting end up in bed together.
And you know what else I don't understand?
I don't understand why you didn't tell him this morning exactly how you felt.
Is that is, Rose?
I mean, are you finished, or is there something else that you don't understand?
Well, actually, there is.
I don't understand how a thermos keeps things both hot and cold.
Neither do I. But I'll tell you, if ever I sleep with Mr. Wizard, I'll find out what I can.
I'm sorry, honey.
It's just, last night should not have happened, but it did.
And it obviously means more to Stan than it does to me.
I mean, right now, he's hurt and he's vulnerable.
Why didn't you tell him that this morning?
I was too shocked and I didn't know how to tell him.
And to tell the truth, I don't even know what I want to tell him.
What do you mean?
I mean that I am totally confused about what I feel.
(knock at the door - Hi, Stan.
- Hello, Stan.
Blanche, Rose, don't leave on my account.
No, they have to.
They're hitching up the house to the car and entering it in the Rose Parade.
We'll see you all later.
- Didn't you like the flowers?
- They're beautiful.
They're absolutely beautiful, but it's too much!
I know!
I can't believe how expensive roses got since the last time I sent them to you.
Yeah, well, everything's gotten more expensive since Truman left office.
Stan, listen, we really have to talk about last night.
We sure do.
What do you say about us getting back together?
Come on in, girls.
- See, what did I tell you?
- Ma, what are you doing?
I was having a meeting with my vacation club.
It seems there are a lot of children who like to take vacations without their mothers.
Yeah, but What are you all doing here?
They never heard of a woman going to bed with her ex-husband.
That's him, girls.
I can't explain it either.
I think we'd better continue our discussion in the kitchen.
Sure, babe.
Beautiful.
Dorothy.
You just want us to get back together again?
Just like that?
I mean, Stan, we're divorced.
Stan, you walked out on me.
You left me for another woman.
I realize I may be rushing things.
But think about it.
We had 38 years together.
A lot of it was good.
I can't believe one stupid mistake on my part could undo all of that.
Well, believe it.
It was one hell of a stupid mistake.
Was I the first guy to ever go through a mid-life crisis and react that way?
Probably not.
But you were the first one I was married to.
Dorothy, Dorothy, hear me out.
I know what you're thinking.
That last night really didn't mean anything.
But you're wrong.
The fact that it happened at all proves that there's still something between us.
And now we've got a chance to start all over.
We could take that cruise we always talked about.
We could look into that antique shop you always wanted to open.
We could stop the sale of that property and build the home we always dreamed of.
There are so many things that we can do together.
So many things you can't do alone.
Don't answer me right now.
Just think about it - please?
Please don't close the door on the rest of our lives.
I love you, Dorothy.
Took me awhile to realize I always have.
You shouldn't take him back!
It's not just my opinion.
We took a vote.
- Hey, what are you two doing up?
- Waiting for you.
We thought you might want to talk.
All the food's already on the table.
We didn't want to waste precious time.
Thank you.
So, what do you want to talk about?
All right, I have not decided what to do about Stan.
I mean, how can I just forget all the time that we had together?
And then how can I forget the pain and the hatred that I felt when he left me?
I I can never trust him again.
If you can't trust your husband, what kind of a relationship can it be?
Sounds like you've already made up your mind.
I guess I have.
Yeah, I just didn't know it until just now.
Oh, I wish there was some gentle way to tell him.
Take it from me, honey.
There is no gentle way to end it with a man.
When you're gentle, they don't get the message.
Oh, Blanche is so right, Dorothy.
That was exactly the problem I had with Eddie Parker.
He was this real sweet guy who was crazy about me, but I just didn't feel the same way about him.
You see, when Charlie went off to war, I went to work for our local USO club.
And that's where I first met Eddie, the Aqua Midget.
He was a blue midget?
Don't be ridiculous.
He was a diving midget.
That was his act.
He used to jump off a step ladder into this gigantic punch bowl.
So, uh what happened?
Nothing, he'd just swim to the side and hop out.
I mean, what happened between you and Eddie?
We talked a lot between shows and of course I didn't realize it, - but he was falling for me.
- Didn't have far to fall.
- It started with little things.
- I'll bet.
Pretty soon the situation got out of control and I tried to let him down gently.
You tried to make it short and sweet?
He just wouldn't take no for an answer.
So I finally just had to tell him straight out that I didn't feel about him the way he felt about me.
It had nothing to do with his size.
It was simply that I could never become involved with anybody in show business.
Thank you, Rose.
I don't know what to say.
And I mean that from the bottom of my heart.
(knock at the door - Hi.
- Hello, Stan.
Come on in.
I ordered up some refreshments.
- Oh.
- After all, this calls for a celebration.
Oh, what are we celebrating?
The fact that you got free champagne with your room?
We are celebrating what you said on the phone.
Oh, what did I say?
You said, "Stanley, Stanley, could I come to your hotel room?
I have to see you".
Mmm, no, that's not what I said.
I said, "Stanley, Stanley, could I come to your hotel room?
I have to see you".
Exactly.
Here you go, Dorothy.
How about a toast?
Look, slow down, Stan.
There are a couple of things I'd like to say.
OK, but usually the man makes the toast.
- Uh Stanley, I - (knock at door That must be my socks and underwear coming back from the laundry.
That is one of the biggest drawbacks of being without a wife.
Chrissy?
Chrissy!
I had to talk to you, Big Stan.
Why didn't you return my phone calls?
I There's nothing to talk about, Chrissy.
Big Stan?
- Who's she?
- Oh, sorry.
This is my ex-wife, Dorothy.
Dorothy, this is my soon-to-be ex-wife, Chrissy.
Hi.
I want you back, Stick Man.
I need you back.
I was so wrong to think I'd be happier with Jean Paul.
I realize that now.
I can't spend another night without you in that big, empty, Ionely, solar-heated waterbed.
No need to say a word.
I understand.
Here you go, honey.
Dorothy, wait.
Chrissy, there is nothing to discuss.
Oh, but Stick Man I mean, the girl flew all the way from Maui.
Oh, that's all right.
I'm a stewardess.
I fly for free.
I know, but the thought should count for something.
Chrissy, something happened here in Miami.
- Something that changed the way I feel.
- Listen - You know, before you - Don't be embarrassed.
Chrissy deserves to hear the truth.
It's all over between us, Chrissy.
This is the woman I love.
Seeing Dorothy again made me realize how superficial my relationship with you really was.
Sure, the sex was great.
Terrific, actually.
But it's OK with Dorothy, too.
And with Dorothy, there is so much more.
I'm sorry, Chrissy.
There's nothing left for us.
The fact is, there wasn't that much there to begin with.
She never could hold her liquor.
Uh Stan, did you really mean what you said about there not being that much between you and Chrissy?
That's right.
I'm glad, because now I don't feel so guilty.
- What are you talking about?
- Stanley I don't feel the same way about us as you do.
- You're kidding!
- No.
You know, what happened the other night brought back lovely memories, but I'm not the same woman you walked out on two years ago.
My whole life has changed and quite frankly, I like the way it is.
- The fact that I'm on my own now - My God, Dorothy.
Are you saying you won't take me back?
We could never have things the way we used to have, Stan.
You see You're telling me that you're not gonna take me back?
Yes, Stanley, that's right.
Let me get this straight, you're definitely not gonna take me back?
Look, Stanley, I'm sorry Dorothy, I'd like to hear the rest of this, but I've got to get down to the lobby and grab Chrissy before somebody else does.
Hey, terrific sex is better than nothing.
Here's to terrific sex.
And the dumb blonde who's not gonna get any.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" - Ma, will you knock it off?
- What?
"What"?
We've been washing glasses for ten minutes.
We've finished three.
What's the rush?
It's not like you have a date tonight.
- Ma.
- It's not like you have a date any night.
Or any day.
When I find somebody worth going out with, I'll go out with him.
- Now, will you please stop nagging me?
- Nagging?
Is that what it's called when a mother wants a little happiness for her daughter?
I'd like to finish these glasses before Gloria gets here.
- Your sister's not coming till tomorrow.
- I know.
Could I borrow your diamond ring and your pearl necklace and your jade bracelet?
Are you planning to come back?
- Some time tomorrow morning.
- Where are you going?
Out to dinner with Jason, the director of our community theater.
He's considering me for the role of Lady Macbeth in Mr. William Shakespeare's masterpiece Macbeth.
I feel sure after our date, he'll make a decision in my favor.
Come on now, Blanche, you're not just using this guy to get a part in a play.
'Course not, Dorothy.
I'm gonna let him use me to get a part in a play.
Blanche, Blanche, does he have a friend for Dorothy?
- Oh.
- We know this is last minute.
So we'll take short, bald, fat.
I'm sorry, Sophia, but I've already palmed Rose off on his fat friend.
He's a lighting director.
Blanche, I've never been out with a fat lighting director.
What'll we talk about?
How should I know, honey?
Talk about light bulbs.
That's a good idea.
Maybe he could explain to me how the three-way bulb works.
I've always wondered about that.
I've always wondered about the same thing, Rose.
That, and what Jane Pauley looks like standing up.
Maybe she can't stand up.
Maybe Willard has to carry her around the set.
Come on, honey.
We don't want to keep our dates waiting.
Wait, Blanche, honey, aren't you forgetting something?
Oh, no, I never wear underwear.
- I mean my jewelry.
- Oh, forget it.
Why paint the peacock?
Your sister never sits home on a Friday night and she's a widow!
Every time I talk to her, she's going out with another guy.
- Ma, she calls you three times a year!
- She's very busy.
I'm thrilled she found the time for a visit.
Ma, why do you always make excuses for her?
I don't make excuses for any of my children.
Except Phil.
Ma, I think I'll watch TV in my room.
Before you go, before you go, call this number.
- What is it?
- A phone number.
I met him at the supermarket.
He asked me to squeeze a melon for him.
He's missing a few fingers, but everything else seemed to be intact.
- Ma, how dare you?
- How dare I what?
I was trying to help!
Ma, can you get it through your head that I do not need your help?
Now please, Ma, get off my back!
Who do you think you're talking to?
Don't you raise your voice to your mother!
Then stop smothering me and give me some space!
Space?
Fine!
Have all the space you want!
- Where are you going?
- To Mildred's!
She's shorter than you.
She doesn't need so much space!
I can't understand why the community theater chose Macbeth for its spring production.
Jason said that they were planning to do a musical but the accordion player died.
Besides, it's a much bigger challenge playing Lady Macbeth!
But Blanche, you don't have the part yet.
You still have to audition.
Oh, honey, I did.
Last night.
I opened to great reviews.
- Morning, everyone.
- Clear out, girls, Dorothy needs her space.
Ma, don't start with me.
Now come on, you two, let's put on our happy faces.
It's a beautiful day and Gloria's coming!
Why don't you just kiss and make up?
Why don't you just blow it out your ditty bag.
- (doorbell - I'll get it.
- I'll get it!
- Ma, I said I'd get it.
- I don't want you to get it!
- Let's not argue.
You get it.
What am I, your servant?
- Hi, Ma!
- Gloria!
So good to see you!
Dorothy, it's wonderful to see you!
- Honey.
- What is this?
You gift-wrapped your luggage?
Of course not, Ma.
My luggage is at the hotel.
Those are gifts.
- You're staying at a hotel?
- I didn't want to inconvenience anyone.
What inconvenience?
You're my daughter.
We shared a body for nine months.
Really, Ma, I'd be more comfortable at a hotel.
Fine.
Be more comfortable.
I hardly see you.
You never come to visit.
You finally get here, you're staying at a hotel.
You could have just called.
- Ma, do you want me to stay at the house?
- Do what you want.
Why don't you stay here?
You can share my room.
- It's certainly easier than arguing with her.
- Right.
I'd like you to meet my two dearest friends.
This is Rose.
- Hello.
- This is Blanche.
- Hello.
- My sister, Gloria.
- Welcome to Miami.
- Oh, well, thank you.
Oh, Gloria, Sophia's told us so much about you.
I especially enjoyed the story about your imaginary childhood friend, David, who lived in the oven.
I had an imaginary friend, but he'd never tell me his name.
- It was during spring planting - Rose!
Do you mind?
Gloria's only staying for a week.
I'd like to talk to her before she leaves.
Come on, honey.
Let's get to that audition.
- Gloria, consider this your home.
- Thank you.
Nice meeting you both.
- I'll tell you about it later.
- Let's go in the kitchen.
- I'll fix us some coffee.
- No, no, wait, wait.
First, open these.
Now, there is a new outfit for you and some warm pajamas and an electric blanket.
Every time I call you, it seems you have a cold!
- Call more often!
- Don't pick on your sister.
Here, she brought you something.
It's a gift certificate for a complete makeover at Elizabeth Arden's.
Maybe now you can get a date.
Please, Ma.
I'm not calling Captain Hook.
I am going to freshen up and call my driver.
Then I'm taking you for lunch and a shopping spree, Ma.
- That Gloria's some special kid!
- Oh, Ma, she's your baby.
All mothers think their babies are special.
That's ridiculous.
I think all my children are special.
Except Phil.
Sure, Ma.
Can I make a little suggestion when you go for your makeover?
- Sure, what is it?
- Don't expect a miracle.
- Hi!
How was the audition?
- Wonderful!
I'm 99% sure I got the part!
There were so many good people there!
Trust me, I got this part in the sack!
- She means in the bag.
- No, honey, she means in the sack.
- Where's Sophia?
- She and Gloria went shopping.
- They haven't come back yet.
- Gloria seems like a lovely person.
She is a lovely person.
And she's sophisticated and worldly and wealthy and has never had a pimple in her life.
- Do I detect a little sibling rivalry?
- Oh, I don't know.
I guess I've just always had the feeling that my parents liked Gloria better than they liked me.
I know for a fact my parents liked my sisters better than they did me.
Oh, Blanche, that's silly!
How could you know a thing like that!
They told me!
Oh, Blanche, I can't believe that your parents told you that!
I don't care if they are from the south.
They didn't tell me in words.
They told me in actions.
Like on our birthdays.
When we were little, every year, my sisters had huge parties with clowns and magicians and tons of presents.
- And you didn't.
- Well, not exactly.
I did have parties and I had presents but I never had a clown.
- Not until I was much older.
much older.
Yeah.
But that's another story.
My parents always made each of us feel like we were the favorite.
They loved all nine of us equally.
We used to have the best Christmas Eves.
Daddy'd sit at Grandma's old player piano and he'd play Christmas carols and the children would sing along, then Mother'd bring in some homemade eggnog and snickerdoodles.
And then we'd decorate the tree.
And after Daddy'd hung the star at the very top of the tree, we'd all join hands and pray, and then Daddy'd tell us a story and - tuck us into our feather beds - Who was your father?
Michael Landon?
Can I help it if I came from a happy family?
Well, we had our share of problems.
Believe me, we had some hard times.
Once a mysterious drifter stole our butter churn.
Well, I guess Ma and Gloria aren't coming back for dinner.
What say we go out and grab a hamburger?
Oh, sounds good to me.
This reminds me of when Daddy used to take us for hamburgers on Saturday night.
We'd grab our dog Binky, and we'd pile into the I hope you're not mad at me for keeping Ma out so late.
Of course not.
Did the two of you have a good time?
Ah, wonderful.
I like being with Ma.
I want to spend more time with her.
- And I'd like us to get closer, too.
- I wish there was more time.
I mean, I see you just packed for the weekend.
Dorothy.
You don't resent me, do you?
Don't be silly!
Why would I resent you?
Oh, please!
- For having money?
- No, I don't resent you.
Oh, I did, a great deal, as a matter of fact, but I've outgrown it.
Even though my marriage was happy and yours hit the rocks?
Well, that bothered me for awhile, but I got over it.
Even though all my children are practicing professionals and yours aren't?
Please, Gloria, I'm happy for your children!
All except Katherine.
No, she really should've taken the nose job instead of the Mustang for graduation.
This reminds me of when we were little, and you used to tell me bedtime stories.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
"The Bogeyman and the Little Girl," "The Zombie in the Hamper," "Cannibal Parents".
I think between the ages of five and seven you might've gotten two hours sleep.
Why don't you ever come to California to visit me?
Well, it's not easy, you know.
I have my job, I have responsibilities, I've never been invited.
Well, I'm inviting you now.
I have a huge house with servants and an ocean view.
And Bert Convy shops in my grocery store.
Bert Convy?
Let's leave now!
I was telling Ma about it, you know.
How great the weather is and how she would never have to lift a finger for anything and she really liked the idea of maybe coming out.
It would be great if she were to come out for a visit sometime.
Well, I was thinking of more than just a visit, Dorothy.
I was thinking of a permanent arrangement.
- What do you mean?
- I want Ma to come live with me.
So I asked her to and she said yes.
- Hi, Ma.
What are you doing?
- Having a toga party.
- I'll talk to you when you're not busy.
- I'm not busy, but do what you have to.
Gloria tells me you're gonna go live with her.
That's right.
I think it's best.
- Isn't that kind of a fast decision?
- Why, you think I'm making a mistake?
Oh, no, of course not.
I mean, you know, not if you think it's best.
What do you think?
Well, I can understand why you'd want to live with her.
She can give you so much more than I can.
You'd live in a mansion, you'd have servants, you'd do your grocery shopping with Bert Convy.
And you'll have your space.
And you can sit home on Friday night and become an old maid like your Aunt Regina and you won't have to listen to me nag.
Then I guess it's all settled.
- I guess so.
- Well, I'd better get to work.
- Ma?
- Yeah?
If you need any help moving, just let me know, OK?
I'll do that.
I'm afraid I have some bad news.
I'm afraid I have some bad news.
Blanche, I'm afraid I have some bad news.
Goodness!
I'd better sit down.
Dorothy just said she had bad news.
Oh.
Since you got here first, you go ahead and tell her first.
- You go ahead.
- No, really.
- I insist.
- You got here first.
Girls, please!
Will one of you just say something so I can become hysterical, eat a box of Mallomars and get it over with?
OK.
Jason called.
You got a part in Macbeth.
but I'm afraid it isn't the part you were hoping for.
What part did I get?
Witch number three.
A witch?
He cast me as a witch?
Well, who got Lady Macbeth?
Don't tell me!
Probably one of those little theater groupies with a mattress strapped to her back.
No, it isn't.
It's me.
Oh!
You're pulling my leg!
- He picked you over me?
- Listen, I hate having to Hold on, Dorothy.
This is a joke, isn't it?
He didn't really pick you over me.
Oh, Blanche, I didn't even want the part, but Jason said I have presence.
- Listen, I really have to go to work - He actually picked you over me?
I do not believe this!
I have been had.
I know.
And you still didn't get the part.
All right, Dorothy.
I'm ready.
Now tell me your bad news.
My mother is leaving.
She's going to move in with my sister, Gloria.
- You're kidding.
- Sophia can't leave!
- She just can't!
- She's a grown woman.
- She can do anything she wants.
- Why's she leaving?
Isn't she happy here?
I guess she thinks she'll be happier with Gloria.
Well, what about us?
Who's going to keep after us and make us linguine and tell us stories about Sicily?
I don't know, Rose.
Maybe Mary Poppins has an Italian cousin.
- Dorothy, do you want her to go?
- Of course not!
- It's breaking my heart!
- I am not gonna let her go without a fight!
Me neither!
Sophia's like a mother to us all!
- It just wouldn't be the same without her!
- But if she wants to live with Gloria, she has every right to do it.
And we have no right to make her feel guilty about it.
Now I really have to go.
Oh, what a terrible morning this is!
Sophia's leaving!
And I'm playing an ugly old witch 'cause you stole my part!
Oh, Blanche, I know how much that part means to you.
You know what I was thinking?
You could go on for me one night.
Well, Rose, isn't that sweet?
And I do love you for it, honey, but I just couldn't.
I could never fit this trim little body into that big old tent of a dress they're gonna have to make for you.
Does your luggage have to sit in the middle of the room?
No, it could also roll over and play dead.
- Something bothering you?
- 'Course not.
What makes you say that?
- Do you want to talk about it?
- No.
Yes.
You come here with your limo and your presents and your designer luggage and you think you're better than everybody else.
You have everything!
Do you have to have Ma, too?
I mean, all these years you've been her favorite.
All I wanted was this time with her.
Dorothy, you are crazy.
You're Ma's favorite - you always have been!
Come on!
You're the one who always got all the attention.
Sure, I got attention!
But only because you were the strongest, the smartest, and you could take care of yourself, which Ma constantly pointed out in English and Italian.
Ma said this about me?
Think back, Dorothy.
When we were kids and Ma and Pop were working, - who did Ma always leave in charge?
- Me.
- Right.
And do you know why?
- Yeah, because Phil played with matches.
No, because Ma trusted you with responsibility.
In her eyes, I could never be as good as you!
Ma looked at you and saw a wonderful future.
She looked at me and hoped I would marry rich.
Which I did.
Very rich.
- Why didn't she ever say any of this?
- She did.
Who does she turn to whenever she's in trouble, hm?
Who did she come to live with?
Her favorite - you.
Oh, come on, Gloria.
That is the dumbest thing I ever heard.
Dorothy, even with all my money, you have so much more than I do.
You have Ma and your friends and your work and Your life just seems so much more important than mine.
And I wanted to take a little bit back with me.
- It's not what Ma wants.
- You think she wants to stay?
I know she wants to stay.
I'm gonna go talk to her.
- Are you all right?
- Oh, sure.
I've got all I need.
And you also have a sister who loves you.
And Pop's nose.
Ma, you're not leaving.
You're staying here with Rose and Blanche and me.
Hey, if I want to leave, I'll leave.
I'm free, single, and 80!
I'm not gonna take no for an answer.
You're staying!
I should have known you couldn't make it without me.
You're right.
I can't.
And neither can Blanche and neither can Rose.
Of course not, Rose!
The woman can hardly find her way to work!
- Then you'll stay?
- Not so fast.
You're gonna have to make a few changes around here first.
What kind of changes?
Like you can't hang around me all the time.
You need your space - I need mine.
OK?
OK, Ma.
So maybe I'll stick around and look after you Three Stooges.
Come!
Oh, Gloria.
I just made a very important decision I think you should know about.
What is it, Ma?
I decided to stay here in Miami.
I had to, she begged.
It was pathetic!
It's OK, Ma.
I understand.
You're a good daughter, Gloria.
You're both good daughters.
Most people my age have children trying to get rid of them.
My children are fighting over who gets to keep me.
You don't know how much that means to an old lady.
Honey, you don't know how much you mean to us.
And I love you.
I love all my children.
- Even Phil?
- Sure, but don't tell him.
He'll want to borrow money.
- Hi, girls.
- Oh, hi.
How was dinner?
Great.
I ate a lot, Ma drank a lot, Gloria paid a lot.
I'm so glad the three of you got things worked out, - and that Sophia's not leaving.
- Oh, me too.
That spunky little lady sure does add life to this place!
Oh, and the stories she tells.
And there's always a little gem of wisdom hidden deep, deep, deep inside.
Listen, when I thought I was moving, I was gonna give each one of you a gift, - but I want you to have them anyway.
- Why, Sophia, how sweet!
- Oh, honey, you shouldn't have!
- Oh, Ma, this is so lovely.
And so familiar.
This is mine.
- I thought the cleaner lost it.
- I told you the cleaner lost it.
I took it - I needed something to go with my black sweater.
This is my black sweater.
- I know, it goes great with - My pearls.
Well, enjoy and be healthy!
I wonder if she's seen my umbrella with the duck handle.
You know, I haven't been able to find my ankle bracelet.
Come on, I think it's time to search her room again.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" What are you doing?
What does it look like?
I'm putting clam sauce in my suitcase.
Ma, I think they serve a snack on the flight.
Heh-heh-heh.
You kill me.
Ma, why are you taking all this food to Phil's?
Because the only time your brother's wife goes into the kitchen, it's to get a cold beer.
Ma, she has no time to cook.
She works all day.
Welding.
My son married a welder.
Too bad she didn't weld his zipper shut.
They got ten kids they can't afford.
Grab that.
Come on, Ma, now be nice.
They're looking forward to your visit.
The six boys are giving up their bedroom for you!
It'll be a miserable week.
I don't know why I'm going.
- Ma, it's your grandson's graduation!
- Big deal.
Animal grooming school.
He'll know how to make that fluffy ball at the end of a poodle's tail.
Dorothy, I've just discovered a great new way to meet more men!
More men?
You're gonna need a turnstile in your bedroom.
I enrolled in a CPR class.
For six consecutive hours, I was on my back while dozens of eligible men pressed their lips to mine and breathed air into my limp little body!
So what?
You did the same thing at McSorley's Bar Super Bowl weekend.
How do I look?
- Ooh.
- Oh, terrific!
I'll say!
To the untrained eye, that polyester could almost pass for silk!
- It is silk.
- Oh, sure, Rose, and Cheryl Tiegs really buys her clothes at Sears.
- So where are you going?
- Out with a friend from work.
The same friend you've been out with five times in the last three weeks?
- Yes.
- All right, spill it.
Who is he?
His name is Dr. Jonathan Newman.
He's a psychiatrist at the grief center.
So Rose, you're seeing a psychiatrist?
It's about time!
The woman gives names to her gingerbread men!
- I'm ready to go to the airport.
- I'm going that way.
I can take you.
- Oh, thanks, Rose.
- Fine.
Wait, you can't run out of here!
We want to hear more about this doctor of yours.
Oh, well, there's not much to tell.
He's a great guy and I like him a lot.
- Can't wait to meet him!
- And his eligible doctor friends!
That's right.
He's very busy, but we'll have him over soon.
- Well, when?
- Soon, I promise.
Come on, let's go.
Ma, have a wonderful trip and call me the minute you get there.
And please, Ma, try not to argue with Phil's wife.
We get along OK.
Phil's wife has her good points.
She's sweet, she's reliable, and when her father gets out of prison, she'll be a wealthy woman.
Let's roll, Rose, I'm leaking clam sauce.
- You're angry.
- I am not.
Yes, I can tell.
When you're really angry, you purse your little lips so tight, they almost disappear.
See?
Have her lips come out yet?
- Nope, she's still mad at me.
- I'm not mad.
But if I were, I'd have every reason to be.
Rose, come on now.
You're about to swallow your chin.
It's just that the invitation to dinner should've come from me.
I asked you three times in this past week to invite Dr. Newman to dinner, - and you always put it off.
- I didn't put it off.
I just forgot.
That's why when he called, I invited him myself.
- He says he's looking forward to coming.
- You should've still asked me first.
You're right, but he's on his way over.
We made a terrific dinner.
So why don't you just relax and enjoy a lovely evening.
You don't understand.
Jonathan is a very special person.
I don't want you doing or saying anything that would embarrass him.
Come on, it's gonna be wonderful.
Now stop worrying and go check on dinner.
I can't wait to meet Dr. Newman.
He was fascinating on the phone.
He analyzed my dream!
What dream?
That recurring dream I have where I'm running naked through a train that keeps going through tunnel after tunnel, while a sweaty bodybuilder chases me.
He said he thinks it's sexual.
He thinks?
For God's sake, Blanche, you smoke a cigarette after that dream.
- Not all my dreams are sexual.
-  I also dream about food.
'Course, I'm usually naked while I'm eating the food.
You know, maybe all my dreams are sexual.
Lucky me!
Oh, no, thank you, little boy, we already take the Miami Herald.
Who was that?
One of the Donaldson boys trying to sell us a newspaper subscription again.
Oh, those Donaldson kids won't take no for an answer.
Neither would their father at our Fourth of July barbecue.
Hello, I'm Dr. Jonathan Newman.
- Are you absolutely sure?
- Yes, may I come in?
Oh, please, please.
Please, come right in.
May I take your height?
Hat!
Thank you.
You must be Dorothy.
Rose has told me all about you.
I wish I could say the same.
Oh, Blanche, Blanche, this is Dr. Jonathan Newman.
Get out of here!
Blanche.
- But Dorothy, he's a - A little early, yes, but we're delighted to see him.
Hi, Jonathan.
Hello, Rose, you're looking lovely this evening.
Oh, wait a minute!
Rose Nyland, you devil, you!
- I just figured out what's going on here!
- Blanche.
You were sore at me for inviting your friend without asking you, so you hired this guy to come over and teach me a lesson!
You!
You God, I wish I was dead.
Blanche, let's go get the hors d'oeuvres.
Excuse us.
I have never been so embarrassed in my entire life!
- I made a fool of myself, didn't I?
- Yes!
Oh, I feel awful, just awful!
Listen, if you don't want tonight to turn into a total disaster, you have to stop being so self-conscious.
Oh, well, you're right, of course.
Dr. Newman is a guest in our home.
If I'm self-conscious, he'll be ill at ease.
I can't allow that to happen.
It would be unsouthern.
- That's a good belle.
- Dorothy, get the door.
Shrimp?
She's pretty uptight.
I'm gonna have fun teasing her tonight.
- Why don't we just start dinner?
- Oh, good.
What are we having?
Short ribs.
Anyway, you'll never guess what happened.
I'm sitting in this bar in Nairobi when who do I see?
My roommate from Harvard!
He decided to go someplace exotic where he didn't know a soul either.
Small world, isn't it?
Not from where I'm standing.
I did it again.
I apologize.
Please forgive me.
Blanche, I'm sure he was only joking.
Don't be self-conscious about my height.
I'm not.
- Really?
- Really!
Look, everybody has something about themselves they'd like to change.
The trick is getting beyond it.
Now, don't get me wrong, I'd love to know what it feels like to be the center on the Boston Celtics, but all in all, I'm pretty happy with who I am.
Oh, God, he gives me goose bumps when he talks like that.
- Why don't I fix us all some coffee?
- You've done enough.
- I'll get it.
- I'll help you.
What a delightful man.
You know, he has the most positive attitude of anyone I have ever met.
And he's wearing the cutest little gray suit I think I've ever seen.
You just can't help yourself, can you, Blanche?
I'm home.
- Ma, what are you doing here?
- There was no reason to stay.
I thought your grandson's graduation was next week.
There isn't gonna be a graduation.
The big dope failed.
- Ma, you're kidding.
- You wouldn't be surprised if you saw him.
the whole time I was there was drink beer and shoot cans with a BB gun.
- Sophia!
- Oh, um Uh Ma, this is Rose's friend, Dr. Jonathan Newman.
- Dr. Newman, this is my mother, Sophia.
- Nice to meet you, Sophia.
Nice to meet you too.
I hope this doesn't sound rude, but I've just gotten back from a long trip and I'm very tired.
- If you'll excuse me.
- Of course.
Nice to have met you.
Likewise.
Dorothy, can I see you for a minute?
- Yes, Ma, what is it?
- That guy over there, is he a midget?
- Yes.
- Thank God.
I thought I was having another stroke.
My goodness, I didn't realize it was getting so late.
- I really can't stay for coffee.
- Oh.
Ladies, I want to thank you for a wonderful evening.
Thank you for coming.
We certainly enjoyed having you.
And we hope we'll see you again soon.
And I'll see you tomorrow at the office, Jonathan.
Rose, could we have dinner tomorrow after work?
There's something important I want to talk to you about.
- OK, sure.
- Great.
Good night.
Good night.
- Well, what do you think?
- He's quite a man!
Oh, he certainly is, Rose.
I'm glad you both feel that way, because I think Jonathan's gonna ask me to marry him.
Marry him?
Honey, what makes you think he's going to ask you to marry him?
I know he wants to get remarried.
Our relationship is getting much more serious, and he just asked me to dinner to talk about something important.
Believe me, he's gonna ask me to marry him.
And how do you feel about that?
I don't know.
I like him a lot, but But you were embarrassed to have us meet him.
Oh, yes.
I hate myself for feeling like that, but it's true.
When Jonathan and I are alone together, everything's wonderful.
But, when we're around other people, I'm uncomfortable.
I know they're staring at him and they're talking about us and it bothers me.
I know it shouldn't, but it does.
I mean, how big a man is shouldn't make or break a relationship.
Not a word, Blanche.
Rose, you're involved in a relationship that has very special problems and only you and Jonathan can decide whether those problems are worth working out.
I can appreciate what you're going through, Rose.
I once went through a very similar situation myself.
- You once dated a little person?
- Oh, no.
No, no, no.
No, what I was referring to was a relationship I had in high school with a young man named Benjamin.
You have to understand that in those days in the South, a lot of things were still taboo.
Certain people were not to mix.
So Benjamin and I had to meet in secret.
We knew if any of the bigots in town found out about us, there'd be a terrible scandal.
And then one day, I had to make a decision.
Benjamin invited me to our senior prom.
I didn't know what to do.
Should I go out with this boy I really cared for, or should I bow to the pressures of an unjust society?
So, what did you do?
I walked into that gymnasium on Benjamin's arm.
Heads turned, jaws dropped.
Why, the room was buzzing all evening.
I didn't care.
I had followed my heart.
And I've never regretted it.
Oh, Blanche, that's a beautiful story.
That must have taken real courage for both of you!
And it's terrible to think that the two of you were almost kept apart just because Benjamin was black.
Black?
Benjamin wasn't black.
He was from New Jersey.
I went to my senior prom with a Yankee!
A Yankee, a Yankee?
That is incredible!
And to think they made a movie about that deadbeat Gandhi, when there's a story like this that hasn't been told.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
I'm more confused than ever.
Goodnight.
Honey, is there anything at all we can do to help?
- No, I have to work this out for myself.
- Why don't you sleep on it?
- I know you'll make the right decision.
- Goodnight, honey.
A Yankee from New Jersey.
You're a profile in courage, Blanche.
Why don't you sleep on it, Rose?
I know you'll make the right decision.
The right decision the right decision  Yes, yes, yes - (knock at door - Rose?
Oh, Rose, honey.
Wake up.
Rosie, wake up darling.
- Rose!
- Wake up, wake up!
Oh.
I just had the weirdest dream about Jonathan.
- Oh, was it a bad dream?
- No.
No.
It helped me make up my mind about our relationship.
I'm gonna keep seeing him.
If we actually care about each other, we can lick any problem, big or small.
What's going on?
Oh, Rose has decided to keep on seeing Jonathan.
Fine.
We're all adults here.
Let the man out of the pillowcase.
We don't mind if he sleeps over.
Thank you.
- What did you think?
- Oh, it was delicious.
I love French food.
What was that you had?
- Trout.
- What do they call it in French?
Le trout.
Oh, French is such a romantic language.
Oh, I love the food, I love the wine, and especially the company.
I've put this off all evening, but there's something I want to talk to you about.
- What is it?
- I want to talk about us.
Even though we've only been dating for a short period of time, I feel that our relationship is starting to get serious.
- I feel the same way.
- I want you to know I care for you a lot, but there's a problem we cannot continue to ignore.
Rose, in order for a relationship to be complete, each person has to accept the other for what he is.
I don't think that can ever happen between us.
Jonathan, you're wrong.
I can accept you.
I've had time to think this thing through and I can honestly say, it doesn't bother me that you're small.
Small?
No.
I meant I can't see you anymore because you're not Jewish.
What?
Rose, this has been a very difficult decision for me.
You're dumping me because I'm not Jewish?
Oh, no, please understand, I come from a very religious family.
I can't believe this!
I've been agonizing over this relationship and now you have the nerve to Rose, please lower your voice!
People are staring at you.
Staring at me?
They're staring at you!
Well, yes, but I'm used to it.
I'm a very snappy dresser!
I'm sorry I did that.
I guess I was upset.
I understand.
I guess this has been a difficult relationship for both of us.
Oh, it's been a wonderful relationship.
I'm gonna miss you.
I'm gonna miss you too, Rose.
How was the shrimp?
Unfortunately, I'll never know.
You see, he's Jewish, and we can't see each other anymore.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Who was known as the world's fastest human being?
- Dominic Tansey.
- It says Jesse Owens here.
Trust me, it was Dominic Tansey.
He got four women pregnant in one night.
Two in New York, two in New Jersey.
Girls, I am so excited!
I am finally going to do something you've heard me talk about doing for years!
You decided to install a trapeze over your bed.
- No.
Actually, I'm talking about this car.
- Oh, Blanche, it's beautiful!
- Can you afford a car like this?
- Only if I can unload my old one.
Oh, that won't be any problem.
That's a wonderful car.
Rose, you need a car.
Why don't you buy it?
No, no, I couldn't sell my car to Rose.
She's my friend.
My great granddaddy always used to say, there are two things you never sell to a friend - a car and a slave.
'Cause if either one of them quits working, you'll never hear the end of it".
'Course they hanged my great granddaddy.
He said a lot of things he shouldn't have.
- What'll you give me for it?
- Oh, I couldn't buy your car.
It's not my type.
I want a car that says "practical".
Your car says "available".
Well, just take off my personalized plates!
Rose, I'll tell you what.
Take the car for two weeks.
- Oh - Just try it out.
If you don't absolutely love it, I'll take it back.
- Well - No questions asked.
What the heck, you only live once.
Might as well be daring!
Rose, it's a used car - it's not a seat on the space shuttle.
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello.
Blanche, I need you to give me a manicure.
Rose, I need you to lend me your pearls.
Ma, I need you to stay off my back.
What?
What'd I do?
I am going out with a new man tonight and he is not Italian.
- Oh, who is he, Dorothy?
- Oh, his name is Glen O'Brien.
- Where'd you meet him?
- His name is O'Brien.
Two to one, she met him at a gin mill.
He's a teacher at the school where I've been subbing.
- A gorgeous gym teacher.
- Ooh I noticed him a few times and today, as luck would have it, I found myself right behind him in the line in the cafeteria.
After I butted ahead of 25 students.
Anyway, we started talking and in 30 seconds, I was in love.
- And he asked you out?
- Yes!
We're going out to dinner tonight!
I cannot believe how excited I am!
I mean, he's practically a stranger, and I am crazy about him!
I haven't felt this way about a man ever before.
Oh, honey, you've been hit by the thunderbolt!
Love at first sight!
It happened to me once.
Once?
You've been hit by more lightning than the World Trade Center!
- I was hit by the thunderbolt once.
- Probably a direct hit to the forehead.
It was the first time I saw my Charlie.
I was seven and he was eight.
It was a hot Minnesota summer and he had put up one of those little stands on the sidewalk.
- Selling lemonade.
- Insurance.
And I bought a nickel policy on my red wagon.
And right after that, my wagon was destroyed.
- How?
- Some hogs trampled it.
I was hauling home a smoked ham for Mama and I think it set them off.
Anyway, that's when I fell in love with Charlie.
He paid for a new wagon - even though my policy didn't cover acts of swine.
"Acts of swine".
- It's amazing.
- What's amazing?
Oh, I don't know.
A lot of things.
- Like?
- Like you.
- Hardly.
- Like me.
- Definitely.
- Like us.
These past three weeks have been amazing.
They have been pretty amazing.
It's amazing that I just made love in the daylight.
Why is that amazing?
Can't hide anything in the daytime.
At night, I could be Godzilla, you'd be thrilled.
I'm thrilled, period.
Everything about you thrills me.
And that's amazing.
You know, every time you tell me you love me, I turn around to see who you're talking to.
I can't believe it.
Believe it.
I love you.
And everything that I used to worry about in you know I didn't worry about with you.
Like?
Like, like, how do I look, how do I sound is my breath bad what's jiggling.
Well, let's see.
Oh, and you.
You are amazing.
You are warm and loving and caring and smart and funny and I don't have to wear flats when I go out with you.
I have an idea.
Let's cut school tomorrow and go to the Bahamas and not leave our hotel room until the board of health threatens us.
- I can't do it.
- Forget the Bahamas.
How about dinner?
Dorothy, listen.
What?
- I have to tell you something.
- What?
What, what, what?
- Oh, boy.
- Oh, God.
I'm married.
What?
It's not a good marriage, Dorothy.
It was over years ago.
I can't believe this.
You lied to me.
No, I didn't lie.
I'm telling you now.
- I'm getting out of here.
- No.
- Let go of me.
- No, you got to listen.
- Please, you have to listen!
- Listen to what, listen to what?
How your wife doesn't understand you?
How you stayed because of the children?
I did stay for the children.
My wife would have moved them back to her home.
My kids would have been clear across the country.
I couldn't bear to lose them, so I stayed.
Your children are over 30.
You're still staying for them?
I couldn't leave her because of all the things Look, I don't want to hear about it.
Oh, my God, I'm storming out to the bathroom.
Will you look at what we have?
We make each other happy.
You lied to me.
I couldn't lie to you, that's why I told you.
Don't end this, Dorothy.
You mean everything to me.
It's over with my wife.
It's just hard to walk out, is all.
Well, not for me it isn't.
- Hi, girls.
- Hi, Rose.
Oh, Blanche, you remember a few days ago when I said your car was making a funny kind of a noise sometimes?
- Uh-huh.
- It's making it all the time now.
It's nothing serious, I'm sure.
It started making a wheezing, coughing, rattling kind of a sound - every time it goes up a hill.
- Oh, that's a bad sign.
Those are the sounds Tony Triano made the night they wheeled him out of the home on a gurney.
That car's in terrific condition.
Sometimes it's a little hard to turn over in the morning.
Tony Triano to a T. Maybe I should have a mechanic check it out.
Oh, Rose, wake up and smell the coffee.
An auto mechanic is the last person to take a car to.
They only make money if they tell you there's something wrong with it.
Oh, that's a good point.
Boy, I wish I had a car to sell.
I'll get it.
Hello?
It's for Dorothy.
I think it's Glen.
That's the fourth time he's called today.
Well, you know what we're supposed to tell him.
Go on.
Hello?
Dorothy's not home and she's never coming home again.
Now, don't call here anymore.
This is Rose, who's this?
Mr. Yamamoto from the school district?
- Rose.
- I'm so sorry.
I thought you were the man Dorothy's having the affair with.
I mean, the man Dorothy said is always so fair with her.
Of course, I would expect you to be fair.
And polite.
And good at math.
I'm so glad you got your own Disneyland.
Oh, ah, thank you.
Goodbye.
Dorothy, Dorothy?
Mr. Yamamoto just called about a teaching job.
Oh, I'm not ready to go back to work yet.
Are you depressed about Glen?
No, I'm depressed because Phyllis George left the morning news.
Of course I'm depressed about Glen.
For three weeks he made me the happiest woman in the world.
This past week without him has just been miserable.
At least you have the comfort of knowing you did the right thing.
Then why do I feel so rotten?
Dorothy, he's married.
You have to forget him!
- I can't just forget him!
- Rose, come on.
None of us is a schoolgirl anymore.
Although, quite frankly, I am sometimes mistaken for one.
Oh, please, Blanche.
As long as Glen and Dorothy are realistic and discreet about their situation, - who are they really hurting?
- No one.
That's who.
Blanche, are you condoning their behavior?
No, I'm just not passing judgment.
Sometimes life doesn't work out the way we'd like it to.
Sometimes we have to just grab our happiness where we can get it.
That's the same attitude that broke up Debbie and Eddie Eddie and Liz.
Liz and Dick.
Martin and Lewis.
Rowan and Martin.
Shut up.
Hello?
Oh, hello Glen.
Hang up on that bed-hopper.
Don't hang up on him.
That man cares for you.
Hop, hop.
Go with your feelings.
Glen, I thought I told you I don't want to talk to you.
That's right.
If he wants to talk or hop, let him do it with his wife.
Don't deny your passion.
It's unnatural.
Look, Glen, you are making this very difficult for me!
No, I will not change my mind.
Goodbye, Glen.
Oh, Dorothy, I'm proud of you.
You'll see, it's not the end of the world.
No, just feels like it.
Oh, I hope I'm doing the right thing.
You are if you really meant it when you said you never want to see him again.
Oh, come on.
Let's start supper.
Come on.
I'll be with you in a minute.
Glen?
Dorothy.
Yeah, I miss you.
I think we have to talk.
Yes, yes, Mr. Yamamoto, yes.
Fine, I'll see you there.
- Oh, I'm so glad you're going back to work.
- Yeah, he was thrilled, too.
- Dorothy?
- What is this, the Spanish Inquisition?
Look, I don't have to defend myself.
If I want to see Glen, I'll see Glen.
You're seeing Glen?
I don't want to hear about it.
Well, I don't want to talk about it.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- What are you doing up so late?
- I was hungry.
I was making myself a sandwich.
Do you want one?
- No, thanks, we went out to dinner.
- Oh, that's nice.
So you spent the evening at dinner.
No, we spent dinner at dinner.
We spent the evening at a motel.
A motel?
Dorothy!
A cheap, tawdry, bare-bulb den of iniquity?
We didn't drive to Sodom and Gomorrah, Rose.
It was a very pleasant place over on Biscayne Bay.
- I don't want to hear about it!
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Maybe I'll have something.
I was too nervous to eat much at dinner.
But I suppose the rest of the evening really built up an appetite.
Oh, hi!
I didn't expect to see you girls up so late.
I'm just having a snack.
Dorothy's the one having an affair at a motel.
- Thank you, Rose.
- I just want to keep the record straight.
Besides, Blanche has had experience in that area.
- Maybe she can give you some advice.
- I certainly can.
In the first place, never check in as Mr. and Mrs. Smith.
Always check in as Mr. and Mrs. Don Shula.
What?
That way, you always get a complimentary fruit basket and a bottle of champagne.
Good night.
- Dorothy's seeing Glen again.
- That's right.
And I don't need any advice.
I can handle it.
Dorothy, I had a third cousin who ran around with a married man - for 15 years.
- Are they still together?
Well, they would be, but his wife shot him in the boxer shorts.
- And after that, he just kind of lost interest.
-  Iost interest.
- Evil is as evil does.
- Oh, will you stop being so judgmental!
This is a situation you know nothing about!
At least Blanche has been there and she knows what I'm going through.
Well, not exactly.
Actually, I've never been with a married man.
Get out of here!
No, it's true!
I just never figured a relationship with a married man was worthwhile.
Good for you, Blanche.
Oh, I'm no fool.
The husband's always so guilty, he ends up giving the really expensive gifts to the wife!
Look, I didn't choose for things to happen this way.
I tried to do the right thing, but the right thing was not right for me.
I'm in love.
And if there are sacrifices that have to be made, I can accept them.
I'm happy and that's what matters.
Hi, Ma.
So, you started up with your married man again.
- How did you know?
- I'm the Amazing Kreskin.
- I was listening outside the door.
- Oh, Ma.
Oh, I can't put my ear to the door, but you can put your Ma!
I raised you to have respect for yourself.
Not be somebody's floozy.
Purple rain Sophia, Sophia, where's Blanche?
I have to talk to her about her car!
Purple rain - Hi, Rose.
- Blanche, about your car.
- I went to the bank to get the money.
- I can't sell you that car.
- But, Blanche - Honey, I can't sleep from all the worry and guilt I have been suffering.
I wasn't totally honest with you.
I told you that car was in perfect condition.
Well, it's not.
It's a piece of junk.
It's the noisiest thing to come out of Detroit since Martha and the Vandellas.
When I went to trade it in, they only offered me half the blue book price.
I need the whole amount to put down on my new car, so that's why I tried to sell it to you.
But I can't go through with it!
I cannot sell you that car!
You can't sell it to anyone.
Somebody stole it.
- What?
- Somebody stole Blanche's Very nice, Rose!
I lend you a perfectly fine automobile, no strings attached, and you let some thief drive off in it!
Rose Nylund, I will never forgive you!
Wasn't it insured?
They'll pay you full blue book.
All is forgiven!
I'm gonna go call the car dealer right now and tell him he made a sale.
Blanche, was the gist of what you were saying before - that you intended to cheat me?
- Cheat you?
Rose, you just analyze everything to death!
Ma, where are my shoes?
Another date with Mrs. O'Brien's husband?
Now look, don't you start with me.
I will continue to see Glen for as long as I please!
Is he gonna leave his wife?
Ma, Ma, for the first time in a long time, I am really happy.
So please, leave me alone!
If you're so happy, how come I hear you pacing in your room night after night?
I can't sleep.
I have a lot on my mind.
I'll tell you what's on your mind.
You hate yourself.
- I do not.
- My mistake.
I've only known you since the day you were born.
Look, I've heard enough, Ma.
I'm leaving now to meet Glen - and have a perfectly marvelous time.
- I hope he's taking you bowling.
- Bowling?
- Yeah, you could rent shoes there.
If you want to grab some dinner, we'll have to take separate cars.
I'm gonna have to leave for home right from the restaurant.
Glen, forget dinner.
We need to talk.
Things aren't working out anymore and I don't know what to do to make them any better.
You can't leave your wife and I'm not cut out to be the other woman.
- Dorothy, you know I love you.
- I know that.
But it's not enough.
- I don't want to lose you.
- I don't want to lose you either.
That's why I came back.
I thought you understood.
I can't break up my marriage!
Not now, not at this stage of my life.
If things didn't work out between you and me, I'd be alone.
That kind of risk is fine when you're 40, but I couldn't do it today.
I'm too old for that, Dorothy.
Glen, the risk shouldn't scare you at any age.
And at any age, the loving would make it worthwhile.
You want a safe, easy, comfortable home life and a romance and excitement on the side and it's not for me.
Please think about what you're throwing away.
If I stay, I am throwing away my future.
Now I'll go home.
I'll hurt.
But after awhile, I'll feel better and I'll go on with my life.
If I continue this, I'll end up alone.
And I care too much about myself to let that happen.
Dorothy, I love you.
I love you too.
Goodbye.
- Hi, Ma.
- You're home early.
I broke up with Glen.
I told him I couldn't see him anymore.
- I'm sorry.
- I thought you'd be happy.
You want me to be happy?
Help me put away the dishes.
- You still angry with me?
- I was never really angry.
I was worried.
I don't like seeing you in pain.
- Still angry with me?
- What for?
For trying to stop your daughter from making a mistake?
Somebody has to.
You kids get to be middle-aged, you think you know everything!
I don't care what you say, you were speeding!
I tell you, that is not why that highway patrolman was following us!
Oh, Blanche, please.
Dorothy?
Oh, I thought you were out.
No, we ended the evening early.
- You and Glen have a disagreement?
- Yeah, he thinks he should stay married.
You mean it's over?
Look, we just came back to pick Sophia up.
Blanche got her new car!
Yeah, and we're gonna all pile in and go cruising.
- Do you want to go with us?
- No, I think I'll just stay home tonight.
I feel, you know, just like sitting.
Me too.
I think I'll have a cup of tea.
It's kind of late.
I'm a little tired.
I think I'll just stick around.
Oh, what the heck.
That car will still be there tomorrow.
Boy, this is depressing!
Girls, let's go cruising.
I know a place where guys wrestle naked in the mud!
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Well here we are.
- Rose please.
- I can't, Al.
We've been seeing each other for a month, Rose.
I've never wanted anyone so much.
What about your place?
My sister's there.
She's an insomniac.
We'd have an audience.
I can't let you stay here.
I just can't.
I simply can't take you to a hotel.
It just cheapens it.
I guess we're doomed.
Let's talk inside.
The thing is, I've never done this before - bring someone home.
I understand.
Are you quiet?
I'm whispering.
I don't mean now.
I mean then.
Oh, very quiet.
I'm very quiet.
I don't scream.
I don't shout.
I'm a very quiet person.
I even wear quiet clothes - all solids.
- I'm quiet, too.
- Then we'll be fine!
I just don't want the others to know you're here.
They'll never know.
In the morning, we're getting up early to play golf.
- You can leave while they're gone.
- Great.
- They won't know?
- Never.
OK but quiet.
Like a mouse.
- Good morning.
- Oh, boy.
That must have been some dream you were having last night.
- What are you talking about?
- I never heard such a racket.
I thought you were making love.
No, no, I wasn't.
No.
It was a nightmare - an awful nightmare, just terrible.
Isn't it interesting how the sounds are the same for awful nightmares and great sex?
Really?
I wouldn't know.
- Oh, Dorothy, come on.
- Shouldn't we get going, girls?
You don't make noise?
- No.
- How can you not?
Well, I guess I always felt it wasn't very ladylike.
- We should go, girls.
- Hold your bladder, Rose.
- Not a sound?
- Well, it never seemed to warrant one.
- Well, do you talk?
- I've always wanted to, but at that point, it seems that nobody is ever interested in conversation.
Not conversation!
I mean dirty talk.
- Dirty talk?
- Well, not filth, for God's sake.
Dirty talk?
- Morning, Sophia.
- Morning.
- Dirty talk?
- Later.
There's a man in your bed.
- Oh, Sophia, there's not.
- Why, you devil, you.
So that was what we heard, Rose!
- Rose got lucky.
- Not so lucky.
The man in your bed is dead.
- What?
- Dead.
Oh, Sophia.
He's not dead.
I was just in there.
So was I. I went to put back your laundry.
I see there's a man in the bed, so I introduce myself, but he doesn't answer.
He's dead.
He-He's shy.
He's very shy.
Didn't sound so shy last night.
OK, fine, let a dead guy lie there.
It's gonna be 98 degrees today.
It won't be pretty.
Oh, I'm sure he's not dead.
Rose, go look.
Come on, he's sleeping.
I don't want to wake him.
You could light firecrackers in his nostrils.
You won't wake him.
All right, now, Rose, go on.
I don't want dead people in my house.
People?
We are talking about one man, who is probably sleeping.
You don't think I can recognize death?
I lived in a retirement home.
Death visited more often than children.
- Rose, go on.
- Well, I can't.
- Why?
- I'm afraid.
You go.
Oh, no.
I can't go in there.
I have a thing against dead people.
I've never seen one.
I never intend to.
Didn't you see your husband when he was dead?
Oh, no.
I cannot look at dead people.
That's why I don't even watch the news.
Every now and then they stick a corpse in on you.
You could be watching a perfectly lovely story about Central America, all of a sudden, bam, a dead body.
This is ridiculous!
I mean, here we sit, calmly eating our bran flakes, when there could be a dead man in the house.
I'll go.
- She's very brave.
- Boy, I'll say.
I want someone to come with me.
I'll go, I'll go.
I'm from Sicily.
What's the big deal?
He's not dead but he'll wish he was when those two barge in on him.
- Who is he?
- His name is Al.
- No, I mean, what's he do?
- He imports diamonds.
Oh, damn, I hope he's not dead.
He bought the farm.
What farm?
Rose, he's dead.
- No.
- Yes.
Oh, my God.
The poor man.
And with a new farm and everything.
Honey, I'm sorry.
- When did he die?
- I wasn't there, Rose.
You were.
You mean, I slept with a dead man last night?
Honey, I sleep with them all the time.
He was so quiet.
I just thought he was a sound sleeper.
- What'll we do?
- Well, we call the police.
I didn't murder him!
Of course you didn't murder him, honey.
He probably had a heart attack.
Now, look.
His family has to be notified.
Now, did he ever speak of any family?
He had a sister he lives with.
- Yeah, what's her name?
- His name was Al Beatty.
Her name was Beatty, too.
She never married.
I suppose I have to tell her.
Oh, yes, you do.
You cannot let the police tell her.
Oh, the night George died, my telephone rang and a highway patrolman said, "Pardon me, ma'am.
Do you have a yellow convertible and a husband named George"?
I said, "Yes.
Good grief, what's happened"?
And he said, "Hold on, ma'am".
He put me on hold, with that music while you wait.
I sat there at two in the morning, listening to Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass.
And then after an eternity, he comes back on the line, eating chips.
He says, "Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am, but I'm the only one here.
My phone's been ringing off the hook".
I said, "Officer, what about my husband"?
And then he said, crunching his chips, "Oh, he's dead.
Wrong way driver hit him head-on.
Totally dead, ma'am".
Crunch, crunch.
Oh, no!
Puts me on hold, and then eats Doritos while he tells me my life is over.
Oh, Rose has to tell her.
Rose won't eat chips.
I never eat chips.
I don't like them.
They fall in my bra.
Well, honey, you've got to do it.
His sister lives in Boca Raton.
- I'll look it up.
- Oh, thank you.
I can't sleep in a bed that's had a dead person in it.
I just can't!
- You'll get a new bed.
And sheets.
- And sheets.
And a blanket.
Burn down the house.
Oh, poor Al, and he just got a hair transplant.
Here's a Beatty in Boca Raton.
It's the only one.
And somebody told me he just bought a farm.
Oh, my God.
What'll I say to her?
- That he died in the bed of an idiot.
- Ma!
- You tell the truth.
- Well, I can't tell her the truth.
- I can't tell her where he died.
- He died visiting.
- That's what you tell her.
- Visiting.
- Right.
- Visiting - that's good.
Oh, I just can't believe he's dead.
- I don't think she's home.
- It rang once!
Hello?
Is this Miss Beatty?
I beg your pardon?
Well, do you have a brother, Al?
I see.
Well, I must have the wrong number.
I'm sorry.
Wrong number?
- Right number, wrong person.
- What do you mean?
That wasn't his sister.
That was his wife.
- He was married.
- I can't believe it.
There's a married dead man in my bed!
- Serves him right.
- Ma!
- He lied to her.
- I don't know why they do that.
Don't they know we'll sleep with them anyway?
What am I gonna do?
I can't tell her her husband died in my bed.
Tell her you went to turn on the sprinklers and you found him on the lawn.
- That's not bad.
- Oh, Rose.
Well, I've never had to do this before - tell a wife that her husband's been cheating on her with me.
That's the hardest thing to tell anybody.
Oh, no, it's not.
How about having to tell a pregnant woman that her husband's been cheating on her with her own sister and you're the sister and you're pregnant, too by her husband.
You didn't!
Not me last night on Dallas.
Or Dynasty.
or Falcon's Landing.
or one of those.
They're all the same.
Oh, I thought you were the one.
Oh, please.
I could never do anything like that.
If you saw my brother-in-law, you'd know why.
Look, Rose.
You're gonna have to go tell her.
I mean, she's probably worried sick already.
I've never done anything like this.
Tell a woman her husband's been seeing me?
Mm-hmm, and she'll say, "Why, that dirty rat.
I will kill him".
And you say, "Good news, darling.
You don't have to.
He's dead".
(doorbell Hello, I'm Rose Nylund.
I'll save you some time.
I don't wear Avon, I have a mop, and I'm still paying for an encyclopedia that my son used just once to look up Sexual Genitalia, Female.
Mrs. Beatty, it's not that.
It's about your husband.
He dumped you.
You've been dating him and he dumped you, and now you're getting even by telling me.
- No, that's not - I've heard this before, - I can't tell you how many times.
- You have?
You think you're the first?
Please.
The first time Al slept with someone else was on our honeymoon.
- No!
- In Paris - the chambermaid.
He always had the sign on the door, "Maid Service Requested".
He slept with everyone - secretaries, schoolteachers, babysitters, neighbors, friends.
One Easter, we gave our little boy some rabbits.
They used to look at Al in amazement.
How long had you been seeing him?
About a month but that's not why I'm here.
- I have bad news.
- Well, you couldn't be pregnant.
Last night, Al had a heart attack and died.
Oh, Mrs. Beatty, I'm so very, very sorry.
Well, you must have the wrong Al.
You've been sleeping with someone else's Al.
My Al is as healthy as a horse.
It can't be him!
- Al Beatty, from Boca Raton?
- Yes.
- You're telling me Al is dead?
- Yes.
A heart attack is crazy.
He was a runner.
He couldn't have a heart attack.
I'm talking, so it can't be true.
You know what I mean?
If I keep talking, it isn't true.
All I have to do is talk forever.
Oh, God, Al!
I'm all right.
I'm OK.
Al the big jerk.
I loved him.
He was a decent man, you know?
I know.
- He was.
- Caring.
- Very.
- Special.
And it's all my fault!
He had a heart attack.
It's not your fault.
He had a heart attack with me.
Mrs. Beatty, my late husband had a heart attack with me as well.
They drop like flies around me!
Mrs. Nylund, you're not responsible for the death of my husband.
- I'll never date again.
- You will.
I won't.
I can't.
- In time, you'll forget this.
- Never.
I promise you.
It's OK.
I'll get used to being alone.
- Mrs. Nylund.
- Yes?
You've been sleeping with my husband and he's just died.
See if you can pull yourself together, because in a minute, I'm going to need some comforting myself.
All right, try this dressing and tell me what you think.
It's called Creamy Zesty Italian, only has one calorie.
Mmm.
If you ran it under the faucet, it would have more flavor.
Shoot.
Honey, beware of anyone who says, "no calories," "absolutely no charge," and, "let's just lie down on the bed and watch television".
- Hi.
- Hi.
Did you do it?
- Yeah.
- And?
I'm gonna become a nun.
I'm the kiss of death.
It's the second time a man has died in my bed.
The second time?
- Dorothy knows.
- Charlie.
- No!
- Yes.
What exactly do you do in bed, Rose?
Nothing.
I do nothing.
Well, maybe that's it.
They have to do it all.
Come on, Blanche.
It's not her fault.
She has a perfectly normal sex life.
Now, I knew somebody who had seven husbands and six of them died of stomach ailments.
Well, they arrested her.
She'd been putting ground glass in their salads.
- Why?
- Because she ran out of croutons!
Because she wanted to kill them, Rose.
We had a neighbor in Minnesota who killed her husband.
She backed over him with a combine and she didn't even know she had done it until she found little bits of plaid in the corn.
She said, "Funny, that looks like bits of Joe's plaid shirt "and that looks like bits of Joe's overalls "and that looks like bits of Joe's arms and that looks like bits of" - Rose!
We get the picture!
- They had a very little coffin - Ah!
Listen, Rose.
You are not to blame.
Now, you know that.
Of course I know that.
She was driving the combine.
I wasn't anywhere near their farm.
Come on, Rose, it'll be fun.
- You like square dancing.
- No, thanks.
You're only gonna be dancing with men.
You can't kill them by doing that.
Nope.
No more men.
That's it for me.
No more men?
My God, I would die.
I would just die.
- It's not like no more food, Blanche.
- It's worse!
There are many women who live happy lives without men.
- Oh, who?
- Well, Inga Lundqvist.
Who was she, some Swedish lesbian?
She was a neighbor of ours.
Not, by chance, the one who shredded her husband with some farm machinery?
Yes, and she never remarried.
And she led a very happy rest of her life baking, sewing, gardening, tending the animals.
Ooh, my favorite things.
OK, let's get this show on the road.
Rose, you sure you don't want to come and just watch?
Come on, Rose.
You'll sit and watch my dentures eat corn on the cob.
It's a lot of laughs.
No, I don't want to kill anyone else.
Honey, you sure you're gonna be all right here alone?
She'll be fine.
If someone breaks in, she'll just have to sleep with them.
(doorbell - Who is it?
- Mrs. Beatty.
Oh, Mrs. Beatty, come in.
I just had to come by.
You were so caring to come tell me in person what happened - that I had to do something for you.
- Oh, that wasn't necessary.
Well, I know you blame yourself for Al's death.
Well, I just got the autopsy results, and they showed that Al's arteries were completely clogged.
Oh, his diet was terrible.
He never ate a vegetable.
He lived on fatty foods.
He'd have meat for dessert.
You didn't kill him, Mrs. Nylund.
He killed himself.
He committed suicide?
In a manner of speaking.
He'd have died whether he'd been here or not.
I'm so glad not that he's dead.
I know.
I just had to tell you you had nothing to do with it.
- Thank you.
- And if he had to die, I'm glad he didn't die alone on the street, but here, with a caring person, doing what he liked to do best.
- Ma!
- What?
Will you stop telling her what to play?
I'm not saying a word.
Did I speak, Blanche?
- Not a word.
- You keep shaking your head.
I've been holding it up for 80 years.
You'd shake, too.
Well, what do you think?
- Of what, honey?
- My new dress.
- Oh, is that new?
- Yes.
It's sort of old-fashioned looking.
I wasn't sure it was new.
- Oh, that's the style.
The girl told me.
- What was she, a pilgrim?
Come on, Blanche.
You look wonderful, Rose.
Absolutely lovely.
Well, I suppose I should go.
I haven't had a date in three months, but I just don't know what to do.
I adore Arnie.
He's the sweetest man in the world, and very special to me.
And it'll be hard no to, you know, because I like him so much, and since we're going away for the weekend, and since we already have, if I don't, then he'll think I don't like him anymore, and I do.
So maybe I will, but I don't know.
I might not.
Rose!
Rose, honey, you know you are not responsible for Al's death, so why don't you just go on, have a good time, - and whatever happens, happens.
- I know Al had bad arteries, but still, I can't be totally sure.
Come on, now, Rose.
You do what makes you comfortable and don't worry about anything else.
OK.
Well I'm off.
Totally!
I wonder where she is.
She's almost two hours late.
Oh, they probably hit traffic.
I bet she slept with him.
I wouldn't be surprised if she didn't.
Well, I sure couldn't be with a man I liked and abstain.
You know, I abstained after Stan and I split up but it wasn't a very different experience from when Stan and I were together.
- Oh, here she is.
- Well?
Well, what happened?
- What?
- How was it?
You had a terrible time?
- You had a wonderful time?
- Honey, tell us what happened!
Arnie I slept with him.
- And?
- He died.
- What?
- Oh, no, Rose.
And the sheriff - I told him about me, how I kill men and he didn't believe me!
He said, "Let's see.
Sleep with me".
So I did and the sheriff died.
Arnie's fine!
We had a wonderful time.
Everything's terrific.
I was only joking!
- You what?
- It was a joke!
- A joke.
- That's a terrible joke!
- Awful!
- You can't joke about a thing like that!
- My God, Rose!
- Well, I'm sorry.
- I believed her.
- I was set to go to her hanging.
Some joke!
I thought it was funny.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" - Morning.
- Oh, here, taste this.
- What is it?
- Oh, it's my special maple syrup, honey, brown sugar, molasses, Rice Krispies log.
How practical.
A snack you can panel your den with.
Some people put flour in it, but I think that makes it too heavy.
My kids always liked it this way.
Tell me, Rose, do any of your kids still have their own teeth?
I know it's a little sweet, but it's Kirstin's favorite.
What are you and your daughter planning on doing this week?
My granddaughter's never been to Florida before, so I thought I'd take them to SeaWorld and Gatorworld and Reptile World - and Parrot Village.
- What?
The parrots don't get a world?
This is outrageous.
Dorothy, just look at this man.
He is obviously guilty as sin.
I don't even know why they bother with a trial.
- What trial?
- Oh, the Duncan Osgood trial.
That big society murder over in Palm Beach?
What makes you so sure he's guilty?
His wife was found at the bottom of their private lake clutching his dickey in her hand.
Well, that would certainly place him at the scene of the crime.
Look at this.
I'm a walking time bomb.
Stand back, I could blow any minute.
Ma, you know that machine is not working.
We shouldn't take any chances.
I can't be moved.
Somebody else will have to give up their room for Rose's family.
You're fine.
You're staying with me.
You always complain and we always get through it.
All right, fine.
But I'm begging you, while we're sleeping together, please lay off the broccoli at dinner, huh?
Sophia, I really appreciate you giving up your room.
It's just so much more fun having the family here than at a hotel.
- I bet you're pretty excited about their visit.
- Oh, yes - and a little nervous.
- Nervous?
Why would you be nervous at your daughter and your granddaughter?
My friend Maria is always nervous when her daughter Theresa comes for a visit.
Of course her daughter is a hitman for the Mob.
The rumor is she dated Frank Sinatra.
You know the song "The Lady is a Tramp"?
It used to be "Theresa is a Tramp".
Well, they had to change it for legal reasons.
Ma, what are you talking about?
Somebody asked me about Frank Sinatra.
We were asking Rose why she's nervous about seeing her daughter.
Then try to stay on the subject.
Why are you nervous, Rose?
I'm nervous 'cause I made Kirstin executor of my will and I have to go over the documents with her.
Well, honey, she's a big girl.
I mean, this may not be the most pleasant conversation you two will ever have, but she can handle it.
There are some things in there that might surprise her.
- Oh, some deep, dark, family secrets?
- No, I just don't know how she'll react.
Oh, boy, I'd love to put some surprises in my will.
Like leaving a small remembrance to each of the men who has brought some special joy or pleasure to my life.
Where would they read that will, Blanche?
The Astrodome?
Or maybe I'll just do something like, "To my sister Virginia, "I hereby bequeath my diamond brooch, my collection of Wedgwood china, - and all my stock in AT&T".
- You have stock in AT&T?
I don't have any of those things, but for one brief moment, Virginia would think she'd hit the jackpot.
That's why mm-mm is a tramp.
- Are they here yet?
- No, not yet.
But Rose left for the airport over an hour ago.
Wait until you see what I bought.
I found the most stunning silk dress, an incredibly revealing lace nightie, and look, these just adorable sequined socks.
Sequined socks I think they kind of make a personal statement.
Yeah, this end up.
Sophia!
Anyway, I'm glad I got back before Kirsten and Charley got here.
- Who's Charley?
- Rose's granddaughter.
That's a girl's name, Charley?
That's a bookie's name!
- She's named after Rose's husband.
- Rose's husband was a bookie?
- He sold insurance.
- An even bigger racket!
Dorothy, listen.
Before Rose gets here, can I ask you something?
- Sure.
- You don't have to answer - if you don't want to.
- What is it?
If you think it's none of my business, say, "It's none of your business"!
You caught me one night sneaking out of the kitchen naked with an Oreo in my mouth.
We have no secrets.
Now ask your damn question.
Have you noticed that Rose has been acting peculiar?
Yes, Blanche, from the first day I met her.
I mean, since she's been getting ready for her daughter's visit.
I think it has something to do with her will.
She's just excited about seeing her daughter.
No, I think it's more than that.
You know how she said she was nervous about showing her daughter her will?
She ought to be, because wills make people do crazy things!
Like what, Blanche?
Like killing people.
Do you know what they just uncovered in the Duncan Osgood murder case?
That the day before she was murdered, Tippi Paxton Osgood had changed her will, making Duncan the sole heir to the Paxton napkin fortune!
- That man is guilty!
- Oh, come on!
That's circumstantial evidence!
I mean, it's not enough to convict him!
Actually, the more damning evidence was a snapshot they found of Duncan dressed in scuba gear, dragging Tippi's body down the stairs, wrapped in a carpet.
Maybe it was from their wedding album.
Here we are!
This is home!
Oh, Charley, Kirsten I want you to meet my friends Blanche and Dorothy.
Hello, Kirsten!
Hiya, Charley!
Rose has told us so much about both of you!
I'm just so glad you finally got to Miami!
When Mom told me she needed me to review the estate papers, I figured it was a perfect excuse to come for a visit.
It's just a will, Kirsten.
I wouldn't call it estate papers.
And while we're down here, I'm gonna go to astronaut camp.
Astronaut camp?
There's a camp for astronauts?
Is it close by?
Down, Blanche.
It's a special program for young people.
Isn't that something?
My granddaughter wants to be an astronaut!
Not really, Grandma.
I just want to meet boys who want to be astronauts.
Me too!
Do you wanna give Blanche and Dorothy the presents we brought for them?
- Sure, Mom.
- Oh, you didn't have to do that.
Hope you like it.
It's very popular in Minnesota.
It's a maple syrup, honey, brown sugar, molasses, Rice Krispie log!
One for each of you.
How sweet.
How incredibly sweet.
Come on, now.
We gotta get you two settled.
- Can you get those, honey?
- Sure, Mom.
- Thank you for inviting us to stay with you.
- Oh, thank you for these lovely gifts!
- What are you gonna do with yours?
- It's a log.
I'm going to burn it.
- Mom, dinner was delicious.
- Oh, it certainly was.
You must have spent all day in that kitchen.
Oh, no.
It's a simple recipe.
You just take some mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables and ground lamb and throw them all together.
Where we come from, it's called Shepherd's Pie.
Where I come from, it's called garbage.
Ma, please.
Rose, dinner was wonderful, it truly was!
Thanks.
It was my husband's favorite.
Charley used to ask for it at least once a week.
You know, I don't believe George ever requested anything special from me.
At least not in the kitchen.
No, that's not entirely true.
Once on our anniversary or was it on payday?
Anyway, I remember a butcher block table was involved Blanche.
Oh.
- Great.
Anybody ready for dessert?
- I am, Grandma.
Oh, good.
I'll slice into that Rice Krispie log.
Ah, just coffee.
- Let me help you, Mom.
- Sure, sweetheart.
Honey, you didn't eat your Brussels sprouts.
- I don't like Brussels sprouts.
- Neither do I. Put them in here with mine.
- Mom, your friends are lovely.
- Oh, they're two very special people.
When you first told me you were moving in with some other ladies, - I was really surprised.
- What do you mean?
I thought, why would anyone who could afford to be totally independent want to live with someone else?
Kirsten, I think there's something I should explain.
You don't have to, Mom.
I understand perfectly.
Meeting Blanche and Dorothy explains everything.
I want you to take a look at my will.
Mom, you keep your will in the cookie jar?
Yes.
Every time I used to walk into the kitchen, your father was in the cookie jar.
This way, he still is.
I think I'd better warn you, I know how much you liked my sapphire necklace, but I thought you'd get more use out of the pearl earrings.
Mom, these numbers don't make sense.
They can't be right.
They're right, Kirsten.
I had them checked with a lawyer and an accountant.
- But there's nothing here.
- Of course there is.
I mean, there's nothing close to what should be here.
Daddy was one of the most successful insurance salesmen in his company.
You couldn't possibly have gone through everything.
Well, Kirsten, times have changed.
Money just doesn't go as far as it used to.
We just came to help.
No, actually you were gone so long, we were afraid you two were making another log.
In 15 years, you managed to piddle away the fortune it took Daddy a lifetime to build?
- Kirsten, it's not that simple.
- Just tell me how it happened.
How could you go through everything Daddy earned?
I don't know.
Bad investments.
I guess I got a little greedy.
You know, get-rich-quick schemes.
- I lost it all, I'm sorry.
- Mother, I am so ashamed of you.
- I don't believe it.
- Well, me neither.
Rose Nylund isn't the kind to squander her money on bad investments.
It's true!
I did it.
I guess you two don't know me as well as you think you do.
"Please join us when we return to the air at 6 a.m. "We now conclude our broadcast day with the Blue Angels Squadron accompanied by our national anthem".
At ease, Rose.
Come on, honey, why don't you get some sleep?
I can't.
- Do you want to talk about it?
- I can't do that either.
Here you are.
I just spent five minutes telling your bathroom door that everything's gonna be fine between you and your daughter.
You should never lie to anyone.
OK, it was only three minutes, but still!
I stood there like a fool.
Even if lying seems like a good idea at the time.
Oh, Rose.
What are you talking about?
Is this about Kirsten?
Oh, Kirsten wouldn't lie.
I raised her better than that.
Except for a little white lie, but that doesn't really count.
Oh, yes, it does!
A lie is a lie, which is a sin, which sends you straight to hell!
- Who told a lie?
- Oh, who hasn't?
Me.
I never lie.
Ma, how much did you lose at the dog track last week?
None of your business, and that's the truth.
What's the biggest lie you've ever told?
I once told my sister Charmaine that she was left on our doorstep by gypsies.
What?
Blanche, why would you want to do a thing like that?
She annoyed me.
Always mouthing off about how her hair was curlier than mine, her complexion was prettier than mine.
I finally said there was good reason for it - she was left by gypsies!
I had her completely convinced!
What did she say when you told her the truth?
Oh, I never did.
I even tried to help her find her little old gypsy mama.
Well, I lied to Stan.
I used to tell him how great he was in bed.
It was really very difficult, but fortunately, I only had to tell him on his birthday.
So you see?
Everybody bends the truth now and then.
It's not a crime.
But I lied to Kirsten.
Now she hates me for it!
- Then tell her the truth!
- I can't!
If I tell her the truth about the money, then she'll find out the truth about her father!
I can't let that happen.
I just can't.
Ooh.
My God!
It's worse than I thought!
Why, this is more baffling than the Paxton Osgood case!
First, Rose had to lie about the money, and now she's hiding some deep, dark secret about Charley!
Well, Blanche, whatever it is, it is none of our business.
Come on, Ma.
Let's go to bed.
No, of course it's our business!
We're friends, we're roommates!
I have no secrets from you.
My whole life is an open book.
Your whole life is an open blouse.
Charley!
Charley, lunch is ready.
Hi.
Did you and Mommy make up yet?
No, not yet.
Oh, but we will.
My, don't you look lovely!
- Thank you.
I have a date.
- Oh, I see.
Anybody I know?
His name is Robert.
He lives in a castle.
A castle?
Oh, that's very exciting!
Would you like some help with your makeup?
OK.
You know, I used to go out with a Robert.
His father owned the movie house in town.
One month, I saw the same picture Sounds like cable.
So tell me about Robert.
What's he like?
- He's a lot like Grandpa.
- Does he look like Grandpa?
- No, he looks like Bruce Springsteen.
- Oh, well, then how is he like Grandpa?
He works very, very hard and he's very, very rich.
- And what else?
- I don't know.
That's all I've ever heard about Grandpa.
Oh, I see.
Oh, I wish you'd known Grandpa, Charley.
- You'd have liked him a lot.
- Do you think he would have liked me?
Liked you?
He would have adored you!
Do you think that this is the right outfit to wear to a castle?
Oh, yes.
And you'll be glad of that sweater.
Castles can be very drafty.
Are you two coming?
The spaghetti is getting cold!
We'll be there in a minute.
We're in the middle of a makeup lesson.
I hope the kid can help you.
You wear more rouge than Miss Piggy!
That's it!
I'm out of here!
Ma, what's the matter?
I can't sleep!
All night long, tossing and turning!
I'd get more rest on Space Mountain!
I'm sorry, Ma.
I can't help it.
I could live with the tossing and turning.
Your cold feet are what's driving me crazy!
It's like having two size-nine Fudgesicles pressed up against my butt.
Ma, will you knock it off?
I have to get back to sleep.
Oh, good.
I'm so glad you're awake!
I'm so glad you're awake!
I'm taking my bed back!
Fine!
Rose, get into bed.
Ma, get out of here, and take your teeth with you!
Don't make fun of your mother.
If I didn't wake up tomorrow, - you'd never forgive yourself!
- I'll risk it!
Dorothy, do you feel like talking?
Oh, honey, if it can wait until morning, I'd really appreciate it.
I'm exhausted.
Sure.
I am too.
Let's just get some sleep.
- Dorothy, you're sleeping with a liar.
- Don't worry about it, Rose.
Most of the people I've slept with were liars.
Good night.
Dorothy, a lie is like a snowball.
You start out with one little harmless lie, and then you have to tell another one to cover up the first.
And then another, and another.
You know what I mean?
And then before long, you've got an entire snowman built out of lies!
Dorothy?
I was gonna let Kirsten leave tomorrow and never tell her the truth.
I was willing to risk having her hate me to protect Charley's memory.
That's Charley, my husband, not Charley, my granddaughter.
But you'd know that if you were still awake.
But then today, I found that the lies that I've been telling about Charley are hurting Charley.
Husband and granddaughter, respectively.
So tomorrow, I'm just gonna have to stop this lying and tell the truth, no matter how much it might hurt all of us.
Dorothy, I want you to know, that having friends like you really helps me get through times like this.
Now you sleep well, and I'll see you in the morning.
I love you.
Thank God.
I thought you'd never shut up.
Well, whoever said a man is innocent until proven guilty sure said a mouthful!
I was wrong about Duncan - he didn't kill Tippi!
Well, what about all that evidence?
The scuba gear, the carpet, the dickey?
It turns out it was one of their trusted servants - who was trying to frame poor Duncan.
- Don't tell me.
The butler did it?
No, he just thought of it.
He made the maid do it.
- Good morning.
- Morning, Kirsten.
I think your mother was looking for you.
I've been to the airline office, changing our tickets.
We're leaving this afternoon.
Where's Charley?
On the lanai.
My mother is trying to help her put Barbie's hair back on with Poligrip.
Oh, Kirsten, you're back.
I want to talk to you.
Not now, Mother.
I promised Charley I'd take her to lunch and then we pack.
We're leaving early.
- Now.
It's important.
- Mother, there's nothing to talk about.
Oh, yes, there is.
And I should have done it a long time ago.
Kirsten, your father wasn't who you thought he was.
Oh, I don't think it's necessary for all of us to be here.
You're right.
Bye, Dorothy.
Don't go.
I want you all to hear this.
I lied about the money.
I didn't squander it on bad investments.
I couldn't have.
- He didn't leave me any to begin with.
- Mother, what are you telling me?
Your father was a wonderful man, Kirsten.
Kind and warm and caring Never willing to let a friend or a neighbor struggle through hard times alone.
But he was also the worst businessman to ever balance a checkbook.
But you always told us how successful Daddy was.
He was a success.
As a human being.
But his work took him away so much, I was afraid you wouldn't know that.
That's why I made him into something he wasn't.
I guess maybe I was afraid you'd think he was a failure.
I never thought of him as a failure.
I hope I never let him feel like one.
If I did, I can only pray that he forgives me now.
- And that you will, too.
- Oh, Mom.
Come on, let's go find Charley and take her to lunch.
Sure.
With the size of our estate, I think we can afford lunch.
So that's it.
That's the big secret.
Charley was a nice guy!
Oh, I'm sorry it lacked the intrigue of the Duncan Osgood case.
But isn't it amazing how things always work out?
Rose and her daughter have reconciled their differences and Duncan Osgood can walk the streets a free man.
- I guess all's well that ends well.
- That's easy for you to say.
You're not at the bottom of a lake, clutching someone's dickey.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Sophia, what are you doing?
Painting numbers on my toes.
I keep forgetting their names.
But Lucy will be here any minute!
Honey, this doesn't look very nice.
I say, let relatives know how you really live.
That way, they don't hang around.
Well, it so happens that my niece and I are very close.
In fact, I'm hoping her interviews go well so she can transfer to a college here and I can see her more often.
I was never close with any of my nieces.
They all became nuns.
It's hard to shop for a nun at Christmas.
Oh, my God, I can't believe it!
- What?
- A rat!
- A rat?
- It wasn't a rat.
It was a cute little mouse.
Rose, it doesn't wear white gloves and work at Disneyland.
- We're talking about a rodent.
- Oh, I'm calling the exterminator!
Oh, no, don't!
A mouse saved my life once.
His name was Larry.
Larry the mouse.
Oh, I loved Larry.
He used to walk to school with me every day on a little leash I made out of kite string.
One day, we were about to cross the bridge down near the schoolhouse, and Larry stopped dead in his tracks.
No matter how I yanked on that leash, he just wouldn't move.
Suddenly, I heard this loud noise.
The dam upstream had broken, and this rush of water swept the bridge away.
Larry saved my life.
If it weren't for a mouse just like that little one in the kitchen, I wouldn't be sitting here today, telling you this story.
Call the exterminator!
-  Boy, you think you know somebody.
I see.
Well, Ed picking up Michael was doing his job.
You picking up Ed is something I think the two of us have to discuss.
Ed, it's been a real pleasure.
Good night.
Lucy, you're grounded for the rest of your stay.
Aunt Blanche, wait.
You're embarrassing me.
Why don't you get a good night's sleep, and we'll talk when I get home tomorrow?
I don't think you heard what I said.
You are not going anywhere.
Aunt Blanche, I'm 20 years old.
I'm going where ever I please.
Come on, Ed.
You walk out that door, missy, you can forget about coming back!
Lucy!
Lucy!
I just don't understand it.
I forbade her to go, and she looked me straight in the eye and walked out the door!
Honey, you have to understand.
Lucy's experiencing her first taste of freedom.
She's going through a rebellious stage.
- Sweetie, it's part of growing up.
- Dorothy's right.
I cringe at some of the stunts I pulled when I went through my rebellious stage.
Like what, Rose, squeezing the cows too hard?
No like climbing out my bedroom window and stealing my father's truck to drive to a bar in the city to meet Clel Lightener.
Clel Lightener?
I think I used that on my hair once.
Oh, Clel was the cutest boy at our high school.
He was also the only sophomore old enough to get into a bar.
So what did you do when you got there?
I sat in the truck for hours, paralyzed with fear.
I kept thinking to myself, "What is a simple Protestant farm girl doing in the parking lot of a gin mill in a flashy, fast-paced city like Tyler's Landing"?
- So did you get out of the truck or what?
- Of course.
I marched up to the door, and I ran right into Reverend Mackenzie coming out of the bar on the arm of Millie Beasley wife of Emmett Beasley, our town's most decorated war hero.
Emmett received three Purple Hearts all for head wounds.
He ran the feed store in our town.
'Course, if the truth be known, Millie was the one who had to make change for the customers.
Rose, are you telling a story or performing Our Town?
Oh, sorry.
Anyway, Reverend Mackenzie made a deal with me.
He said if I didn't tell on him, he wouldn't tell on me.
So, I went home.
Well, did he keep your secret?
Till the day he died which was two days later.
Emmett found Millie and the Reverend skinny-dipping in the church's fountain and he shot the both of them.
A week later, we became Lutherans.
Rose, that isn't a "teenage rebellion" story.
That is a "changing religions" story.
It's a "who cares"?
story.
A "why-the-hell- tell-it-in-the-first-place"?
story!
- Blanche, Blanche.
- Well, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but it's just that I actually went through a very rebellious stage as a teenager.
- I know how difficult it can be.
- What did you do that was so rebellious?
When I was 15, I dropped out of school for a month to become a magician's assistant.
When I was 16, I ran off with a gas station attendant twice my age to get married in Mexico.
When I was 17, I hitchhiked to New York, and for two months, I was a Rockette under an assumed name.
Tyler's Landing kind of pales in comparison.
I stand corrected.
How did you get through all that, Blanche?
I was lucky enough to have my big sister Charmaine chasing after me, trying to talk some sense into my fool head.
Maybe Lucy could use a big sister herself right now.
If she doesn't already have one, I don't think it's humanly possible.
- I'm going after her!
- It's the middle of the night.
- You can't go alone!
- We'll all go.
-  - What are we screaming at?
- I'm not sure.
Dorothy?
- The mouse, the mouse!
Rose, you promised that you'd get rid of it!
Oh, I'm sorry, Dorothy.
I tried to reason with him, but he just didn't seem to understand why he had to leave.
Oh, I thought I had him convinced, but at the last minute, he changed his mind.
Which surprised me, because mice aren't usually fickle.
But this mouse is an odd duck!
Rose, how many head wounds have you had?
I know a lot of people prefer Sonny Crockett on the show, but me, I'm strictly a Tubbs man.
- I've never seen the show.
- You've never seen Miami Vice?
It's only the best show that's ever been on television ever!
(knock on door It's in stereo, for Pete's sake!
- Oh, I'd like to see my niece.
- Sure, come on in.
Aunt Blanche, I can't believe you're here.
Haven't you embarrassed me enough already?
Lucy, can we please talk in private?
Whatever you have to say to me, you can say right here.
- I have no secrets from, um - Ed.
Ed.
If you need some privacy, you can use my bedroom.
Thank you.
Please, ladies, have a seat.
- Can I get you ladies anything to drink?
- Oh, no, thank you.
- I like your apartment.
- Thank you.
It kind of looks like something out of Miami Vice.
Really?
Are you a fan of the show?
- I adore it.
- Me, too!
Miami Vice has been the biggest influence on my life.
That's why I joined the police force.
That's why I drive a fancy car.
That's why I wear expensive Italian suits.
That's why I'm up to my neck in hock.
You can't afford all that stuff on a vice cop's salary.
Who knew, huh?
Aunt Blanche, I'm a grown woman.
I can live my life any way I want to.
Oh, I know that.
I just don't think this is the way you really want to live it.
Is it my fault men find me attractive?
No, honey.
What they find you is available, and that's no compliment.
I find this very strange coming from you, Aunt Blanche, 'cause from the stories I've heard, you're not exactly a saint.
No, you're right.
I do enjoy the company of gentlemen always have.
I can promise you one thing, Lucy - when I'm with a man, it's 'cause I like him, not 'cause I want him to like me.
Well, what's wrong with wanting to be liked?
Aunt Blanche, do you remember what I looked like as a kid?
Oh, yes, I do.
You were a beautiful child.
I was not.
I was short and fat with braces and acne.
And I used to think to myself, "Oh, I would give anything to be just like my Aunt Blanche - to be pretty and popular with lots of friends".
And then when I turned 16, it seemed like everything changed overnight.
I shot up and out, the braces came off and finally, the boys started to notice me.
And it was nice to be noticed, to be liked.
Oh, baby.
Honey, you've been trying so hard to get everybody to like you that you never got around to liking yourself.
And if you don't like yourself, you can't respect yourself, and if you can't respect yourself, neither can anybody else.
Why don't you come on home?
We still have one more week before you have to leave.
I don't want to spend it fighting.
I want to enjoy being with my favorite niece!
Ohh!
OK, how about this one - what was the name of the informant who Crockett and Tubbs accidentally set up in the "Cool Running" episode?
There's no way!
That was Noogie, better known on the street as "the Noog Man".
Rose, you're just incredible on Miami Vice trivia.
I've never met anyone so smart!
Ed, for a policeman, you've led a very sheltered life.
- Come on, everybody, we're going home.
- But I just put popcorn in the microwave.
Oh, listen, Ed, I'm sorry.
You're a nice guy, but I have to go.
I understand, Lucy.
Would you mind if I gave you a call sometime?
Sure, I guess that'd be OK.
Not you, Lucy.
I was talking to Rose.
Oh, I don't think so.
Are you sure?
Tuesday night, I'm getting together with a couple of buddies.
We're going through Don Johnson's trash!
No.
Goodnight, Ed.
We're going to go home now.
And I want you to know, we'll all sleep a lot better knowing you're off duty tonight.
Gotcha!
Trapped like a rat.
OK, so you're a mouse.
Either way, you're out of here!
Oh, listen, you had your chance to leave, and you didn't take it and now I have to kill you.
I mean, I'm probably doing you a favor.
I mean, what kind of life are you having?
What, you hang around sewers, you eat garbage.
That's not living, honey.
Now, believe me, you'll be better off once I put you out of your misery.
I have never killed another living thing in my entire life.
All right, a bug.
Yes, I have killed bugs but they don't count.
I don't know why, they just don't!
I don't believe this!
I'm talking to a mouse.
The scary part is, I think you're listening.
Oh, look, I beg you, mammal to mammal.
Please go!
Look, the exterminator said that you came in through a hole under the sink.
Please, that's the way I'd like you to go.
Oh, good boy!
Ohh!
You have the gift!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh, Rose!
Tell me, how long have you been standing there?
Dorothy, I heard you talking to that little mouse.
It was beautiful.
I wasn't talking to a mouse.
- Yes, you were.
I saw you.
- I was kidding!
Oh, Dorothy, it's nothing to be ashamed of!
There are only a few of us privileged to have the gift to communicate with animals.
Lucy's ready to leave.
Come on, let's say goodbye.
We'll be right there.
Rose Nylund, if you ever breathe a word of this to anyone, - I swear I'll kill you!
- Oh, Dorothy, don't be silly.
You couldn't even kill a little mouse.
That's because you can communicate with them.
Oh, Dorothy, one word of caution.
It's a powerful gift use it wisely.
You let me know the minute you decide where you're going to school.
I will.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, thank you for loving me so much.
These last few days have really made a difference.
Sophia, oh, thank you.
Dorothy, Rose, I hope I wasn't too much trouble.
- Don't be silly.
- No, we enjoyed having you.
- So did half of Miami.
- Ma!
- Have a safe trip!
- OK.
Bye-bye.
Bye, darling.
Blanche, exactly what did you say to Lucy that night at Ed's apartment?
Oh, I told her a lot of things.
I told her she was a bright, charming, funny young lady who didn't have to rely upon sex to be liked.
Well, good for you, Blanche.
You know, I hadn't realized how much she's been looking up to me.
I think the thing that really turned her around was when I told her that when it comes to men, I'm just a lot of talk.
Embellishment's one of the oldest traditions in the South.
Tall tales and tall drinks.
I don't really sleep around near as much as I say I do.
Is that true, Blanche?
Maybe it is and maybe it isn't!
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say Thank you for being a friend - OK.
I am OK.
- Just don't step too hard.
- Just sit down on the sofa.
- I'm all right.
Oh, my God!
What is it?
What happened?
Nothing, nothing, Ma.
Don't worry, I'm just fine.
It's nothing serious.
Probably just a pulled muscle.
It happened in class when she tried to do a six-count Cincinnati riff with a double pullback.
Goes something like this.
Margaret Weinstein did the same thing when they changed her medication.
Do you think she could take Dorothy's place in the recital?
Oh, come on, honey.
I'll be fine by next week.
Maybe you should have it checked by a doctor.
Come on.
It's a very simple thing that comes and goes.
I've had it for years.
I probably just overdid it in class tonight.
I do think you ought to have it checked out.
It's perfectly all right.
Ma, what is that you're knitting?
A bottle cover for the sherry.
Why do we need to cover the sherry?
Not the sherry here in the house.
The sherry I take to the park.
You drink out of a paper bag in the park and suddenly everybody's your friend.
Oh, Sophia, I don't think it's a good idea to drink in the park.
Hey, I do it once a month with the girls from the Cloud Society.
The Cloud Society?
Yeah, we stake out a bench, knock a few sherries back, and discuss what we think the clouds look like.
One afternoon, I thought I saw Pat Sajak riding sidesaddle on a dolphin.
- I'm gonna get something to eat.
- Good idea.
There's that salad in the fridge.
Sophia?
No, I have to finish this.
Knit one, purl two.
Five, six, seven, eight.
Knock it off, Rose.
It's just that I've always dreamed about learning to tap dance.
And I guess I get too gung-ho about things.
When I was a child, I used to get overexcited and pet the cat too hard.
- Ooh, oh!
- Oh, what is it?
- Nothing.
- Sit down!
Nothing, nothing, I'm all right.
I'm fine.
No, you are not and I'm tired of watching you suffer!
That's what Daddy said to our horse, Old Toby, when he broke his leg.
Then he shot him.
Your family was awfully tough on pets, weren't they, Rose?
This could be more serious than you think.
Why don't you have a doctor look at that foot?
- I already have.
- When?
- You don't want to miss the recital.
- I it is fine!
Oh, really?
Let's see you do a Cincinnati time step.
Fine.
- And Ooh!
- Oh, honey!
Oh, all right, all right, I'll go!
For the sake of the act.
If you really want to do something for the sake of the act, have one of those two left feet made into a right one!
Rose!
Blanche!
Dorothy!
Go, Dorothy, go!
Gosh, I didn't realize how long Dorothy's solo is.
I sure hope the doctor says she's gonna be all right!
I won't dance.
Don't ask me.
- Oh, my God!
- Dorothy, are you all right?
- Oh, honey!
- It's not as bad as it looks.
The doctor says I'm fine.
I just have to take it a little easy for a few days, that's all.
- You're lying!
- Oh, Sophia, Dorothy wouldn't lie!
A mother knows when her child is lying - it's like bat radar.
- Now what did the doctor really say?
- He said I have to have surgery.
- Surgery?
For what?
- For kicks, Rose!
No, I have a condition called Morton's Neuroma.
Oh, I think I had that once.
But how the heck did you ever catch it in your foot?
It's a very small tumor, Ma.
I've had it for about 20 years.
- A tumor?
It sounds serious!
- No, no, no!
It's a very simple surgical procedure.
As a matter of fact, I'd only be in the hospital overnight.
- That's it?
- That's it.
Oh, what a relief.
- When are you gonna have the surgery?
- Never.
You just now said yourself it's a very simple procedure.
Oh, it is - for the doctor.
But it happens to be my foot that he wants to cut open.
So you intend to limp around in pain when you could be completely cured in just one night?
- Dorothy, that doesn't make sense!
- It makes sense to me.
I don't like doctors, I don't like hospitals.
Nobody likes hospitals, but there's nothing to be scared of.
Oh, really, Rose?
What about blood?
What about death?
What about those nighties that don't close up in the back?
Well, anybody can make it sound unpleasant.
Dorothy, you are being irrational.
Now the bottom line is we're talking about your health!
That is a very precious thing!
The longer you put this surgery off, the more you may be risking your health!
I just don't think that's a risk worth taking, do you?
Yes.
Fine.
Don't have the surgery.
Let me suffer.
- Ma, it's my foot.
- Your foot?
My heart.
Do you have any idea how much a mother suffers when she sees her child in pain?
- Look, Ma, Ma, don't do this!
- I'll tell you how much.
Worse than the 23 hours of labor it took to bring you into this world.
bring you into this world.
Worse than the burns I got working nights as a fry cook to help put you through college.
- Worse than the time - All right, all right, Ma!
I'll have the surgery!
You win!
You always win.
But you don't play fair.
That's why I always win.
I don't know what you have been complaining about.
I think this is a very good hospital and a perfectly lovely room.
Isn't it a lovely room, Rose?
Very lovely.
I just keep wondering how many people have never left this room.
Where are they, Rose?
Hiding in the shower?
She means a lot of people have probably croaked in here.
I know what she means, Ma.
I just don't need to hear it the night before surgery!
Come on, don't be such a baby!
I had my appendix out in a hospital in Sicily.
That was rough!
Why?
They didn't believe in anesthesia back then.
They had a nurse hold a pillow over your face so the other patients couldn't hear your screams.
You had to pay extra for that.
Sicily, love it or leave it.
Visiting hours are over, ladies.
Everybody will have to leave.
Whoa, where do you think you're going?
- You said everybody.
- Get back in bed.
Take care, darling.
Bye-bye.
Goodnight, pussycat.
- We'll see you first thing in the morning.
- I hope I can say the same thing.
Hello, Mrs. Zbornak, my name is Dr. Ravel.
Oh, hello.
I'm here to tell you that Dr. Ashton won't be able to perform your surgery tomorrow.
He's been subpoenaed in a malpractice suit.
- You are kidding?
- I'm afraid not.
He's a damn fine doctor, too.
I wish I were half the doctor he is.
By the way, I'll be performing your surgery tomorrow.
Look, couldn't this surgery wait until he gets back?
Well, if he gets a hostile jury, you may have to wait three to five years.
You'd be surprised how peeved people get nowadays over any little mix-up.
Mix-up?
I didn't say mix-up and there's no one here to prove that I did.
If you'll just sign these forms, we'll be all set.
- Forms?
- They're just your standard consent forms.
Releasing us from all liability in the unlikely event of your death.
I'm having a simple operation!
How could I possibly die?
Oh, it's possible, believe me!
Just ask Dr. Ashton.
Listen, you know, I really don't think this operation is a good idea.
Mrs. Zbornak, relax.
You have nothing to worry about.
It's a simple surgical procedure, I'm sure everything will be fine.
Here.
I'll leave these forms so you can look them over.
I'll see you in the morning when I get back from court.
Wait a minute, wait a minute!
I want to hear more about this mix-up!
I don't know what you're talking about.
Night!
What do you think you're doing?
I'm giving you the last rites, Mr. Ferguson.
I'm not Mr. Ferguson!
Then what are you doing in bed with him?
The man's dying, for God's sake!
Wait a minute!
There is no Mr. Ferguson in this room!
- Isn't this room 203?
- 303.
Oh, boy, what a day.
- Since I'm here, do you need the last rites?
- No, thank you.
- Have you had your operation yet?
- No, tomorrow morning.
Well, good luck.
I'm sure everything will be fine.
But just to be on the safe side, I'll swing by here tomorrow afternoon.
- Dorothy?
- Yes, Blanche?
- What are you doing out there?
- Checking the sprinkler system.
Looks good.
Good night.
You get yourself in here!
Get in here!
- Where in the world did you come from?
- The coffee shop at the bus station.
I went there from the hospital to think things out.
But this toothless old wino who claimed he was Elvis kept hounding me for bus fare to Graceland.
- So I came home.
- Blanche, call the police!
I just saw a big, ugly man with a limp walk past my bedroom window!
He was wearing Dorothy's coat!
But then again, it was dark and I tend to overdramatize.
- What are you doing home?
- She snuck out of the hospital!
- She's too scared to have her operation.
- Dorothy!
Look, I couldn't help it!
When the doctor came in with the release form, he told me what could possibly go wrong.
I just panicked!
- Darling, nothing is going to go wrong!
- Blanche is right!
'Course, one summer when I was a candy striper, you wouldn't believe the things I saw!
Lost patients, mixed-up medications, botched operations Rose, do a big ugly man with a limp a favor and shut up!
Dorothy, nobody likes being in the hospital, but it's natural to be afraid.
She's right, darling.
Everybody has fears.
Now all of my life, I had an incredible fear of flying.
And I missed out on a lot of things because of that fear!
Then, one day No, don't tell me, don't tell me.
You met a handsome pilot - he invited you into the cockpit.
Of course you said yes, as you usually do in these stories.
The two of you made passionate love and now you cannot get enough of the friendly skies.
No, that's not what happened at all!
- Then how did you get over your fear?
- I never did, but thanks to Dorothy, I now have new hope.
You see, Dorothy, Blanche is willing to face her fear.
- I think it's time you faced yours.
- Look, Rose, forget it!
I am not going to have that surgery and no one is going to make me change my mind!
I thought I heard you in here!
What are you doing home?
- I'm all better, Ma.
- Oh, she is not!
She's afraid to have the surgery because she has a phobia about hospitals.
Do you know why I have that phobia?
Because when I was five years old, I was left alone in the hospital on the day I was having my tonsils taken out.
I was in Cleveland at your Uncle Mario's funeral.
- Yeah, but Pop wasn't.
- Of course not, he hated your Uncle Mario.
Everyone hated your Uncle Mario.
That's how he died - and nobody saw a thing!
Pop left a scared, sick five-year-old all alone at the hospital!
- Said he had to go to work.
- He did have to go to work!
How else could we have paid for the operation?
All I know is, I was alone and terrified and I have never gotten over it.
- I still have that phobia about hospitals.
- It's about time you got over it.
Get the keys to your car.
We're taking Dorothy to the hospital.
Ma, I am not going.
OK, fine.
So you don't want to go back to the hospital?
- No.
- You don't want the doctor to operate?
- No.
- Then it's settled.
We'll do it here.
Blanche, go boil some water and get me a pillow.
Rose, sharpen my Ginsu knife.
Dorothy, pick out a shoe you'd like to bite on.
You're not serious?
No, I'm just acting as stupid as you are.
All right.
All right, I'll go back.
- Oh, you always win, don't you?
- Yeah!
- You're awfully good at this.
- I'm the best.
Here we are.
How come I get the chair with the wobbly wheels?
- Oh, looks like you have a new roommate.
- Hi, I'm Bonnie.
Dorothy.
Glad to meet you.
Now look, are my tests finished?
I am tired of being probed, poked, and prodded.
More men have seen my behind in one day than in my entire life!
They'll be in to prep you for surgery in about an hour.
Until then, just relax.
There aren't enough drugs in the entire building!
- I hope my exercising doesn't bother you.
- No.
Not at all.
What is it?
Some kind of therapy you have to do?
No, I just like to stay healthy.
I hate to break this to you - you're in a hospital.
The exercises aren't working.
- Surgery today, huh?
- Yeah.
I might as well warn you, I am not the best patient in the whole world.
I can put up with you for one night.
Then tomorrow, it is my turn in the operating room.
- You're having surgery too?
- Yeah.
- And you're smiling?
- I've had this procedure before.
The first time, I was as nervous as you are.
This time I know what to expect.
You're having the same operation again?
Don't they get it right around here the first time?
Oh, no, it's nothing like that.
About three years ago, I had a mastectomy.
- And, well, now I'm in for another.
- And you're not scared?
I'm petrified.
No one's that brave, except in the movies and on television.
But at least this time I know what I'm facing.
I've gone through all the steps before.
I have considered the alternatives, dealt with the reality.
The last time, I think I started crying the moment the doctor told me, and I didn't stop until they wheeled me off to surgery.
And then later, I cried because there was so much pain, I didn't think it would ever go away.
But it did.
And it will again.
You get through it.
You go on.
When it comes right down to it, what other choice do we have?
It could have been a lot worse.
I could have missed these last three years.
Dorothy, you all right?
- How do you feel?
- Like a fool.
Like a damn fool.
OK, let's go.
I found your shoes.
They were under Sophia's mattress.
Oh, I didn't think you'd find them that fast.
- What's going on, Blanche?
- My foot hurts.
I think I caught what Dorothy's got.
You can't catch what Dorothy has.
Well, then it must just be sympathy pains.
Ooh.
We're going to be late!
Now come on, let's go!
No, I don't think we ought to dance tonight.
It's just not right.
We ought to be down at that hospital with Dorothy.
Sophia's with her!
She's out of surgery and she's fine.
Now, come on, let's go!
Rose, I have a confession to make.
Flying isn't the only thing I'm afraid of.
I also have a fear of performing.
In front of groups, that is.
- I thought you went to dancing school.
- Oh, that was different.
That was partner dancing - up close and personal.
Rose, what I didn't tell you was, when I was five, Mama enrolled me in a tap-dancing class.
For six months, we practiced.
One hour a day, two days a week.
And I was good.
I was cute and I was good, real good.
And then finally, it came time for the night of the recital.
There were 13 little girls up there with our little Shirley Temple curls and our little starched white pinafores and our little Mary Jane shoes.
Then they opened the curtain and the music started and 12 little girls started to dance.
And one little girl wet her pants.
That girl in the puddle was me.
Oh, God, I have never told that to another living soul, Rose!
You see, I thought I had overcome my fear, honey.
But I just haven't, and performing is a nightmare for me.
- Hey, we've all got our sad stories.
- What?
Look, Blanche, we've practiced for six weeks.
We've paid for our costumes, we told everybody we'd be there!
You're not gonna wimp out on me.
You're gonna go to that recital.
If you end up in a puddle tonight, well, you'd just better break into "Singin' in the Rain"!
- Ma?
- What?
!
What are you doing here?
You were operated on, you're my daughter, where else would I be?
- How long have you been here?
- Since they took you to surgery.
I haven't left the room.
Not for a newspaper, not for food, not for a cold drink.
All day, I've been right here.
Oh, Ma.
Ma, I love you.
Could you fluff up my pillow a little, please?
What, I look like an orderly?
Push the button, wake up a nurse!
I'm just here for moral support.
I already got that from my roommate.
Oh, she's gone.
And I never thanked her.
Relax, she's not the Lone Ranger, she'll be back.
I sent her to the cafeteria to get me a sandwich.
- Hello!
- Hi.
How are you feeling?
I'm exhausted.
- How's our little patient doing?
- Oh, fine, just fine.
- A little groggy, that's all.
- Oh.
- But you're not in any pain?
- I'm not.
Slight discomfort.
You want discomfort?
Try sitting in this chair for eight hours.
- How was the dance recital?
- Oh.
- We were great!
- They loved us!
We've been invited to dance next month at the Sunset Charity Ball!
And there's even some talk about us going up to Palm Beach to be in the cotillion!
Oh, that's wonderful!
And I'll be back and in dancing shape by then!
- Oh - Well, you don't understand.
We've changed our act.
We're no longer the Tip Tap Trio.
Who are we now?
Well, we're now known as The Two Merry Widows!
Hit it, Blanche!
Oh, that was the most adorable dance I think I've ever seen.
Rose, honey, could I look at your hat for a minute?
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" I wouldn't bother getting another estimate.
For that bathroom repair, that's the lowest you'll see.
Are you kid?
This is the highest I've seen.
Look.
$3,000!
Hey, ladies, hire whoever you like, but I'm an expert.
I can take a toilet apart blindfolded.
Now there's a dying art.
What's your point?
The point is, a lot of things can go wrong.
- Wood rot, loose plaster, cracked pipes.
- Crooked plumbers.
- Lady, what are you trying to say?
- Get out.
All right.
I guess you ladies are going into your feminist phase a little late in life.
Oh, I'll go.
You'll call me back.
You know why?
Because as we say in the plumbing game The nerve of that man, trying to intimidate us.
I mean, he must really think we're stupid.
Really stupid!
How could we possibly need three dozen spud gaskets?
What are spud gaskets?
That what goes on the end of a hose bib.
We couldn't need more than a dozen at most.
Rose, how do you know about this?
Oh, I know a lot about plumbing.
We always did our own plumbing on the farm.
'Course, we didn't actually get plumbing till I was 18.
Rose, tell me something.
How difficult would it be for us to repair that bathroom ourselves?
It wouldn't be difficult at all.
Oh forget it, forget it.
It's a crazy idea.
You got that right.
You're not a mechanical person.
You never were.
For the first three months of your life, you tried to breast-feed off my cameo.
Rose, come on.
Do you really think we could do it?
It might take a little time, but we'd sure save a lot of money.
Then let's give it a shot.
Great, my unmarried daughter wants to spend her weekend with a toilet.
Now I can die in peace.
Could I please borrow your long rhinestone chain?
Of course, Blanche.
Why not?
What's Dorothy gonna do with it, snake out a toilet?
It's just so hard to dress for these dates with Richard.
I never know where we'll end up.
Oh, come on now, Blanche.
Even the paperboy knows where you'll end up.
You know what I mean.
With Richard, I have to be prepared for anything.
Last week, he asked me out to lunch.
We ended up going horseback riding.
I've always been afraid of dating a wealthy man.
Why, Rose?
Fear of gold bullion?
No.
It's just that sometimes, rich people think more about money than they do about people.
Richard's nothing like that and I don't think he ever could be.
He is simply the sweetest, kindest, most handsome man I've ever met.
Only I do have a small problem with his money.
Oh, why?
You don't think you'll live long enough to spend it all?
No.
I mean, I just don't want him to think that's the only reason I'm attracted to him.
That's why, whenever we're out together, I always pretend to be totally unimpressed by his wealth.
Isn't that kind of difficult?
Oh, no, not at all.
I don't give a hoot how much he has.
Fact is, I think I'm falling in love.
Oh, come on now, Blanche.
Are you telling me that you'd feel the same way about him if he didn't have a dime to his name?
Absolutely.
I'd just have to see other men behind his back.
Oh, come on.
Oh, my goodness, no!
Oh, come back here!
Oh.
I see you're right at home in a private jet.
Oh, well, I always try to take a private jet whenever I jet.
And here I thought I was impressing you.
Oh, well, it's a perfectly lovely jet, Richard, but there was really no need to fly all the way to Atlanta for dinner.
I'm just an old-fashioned girl.
I would have been very happy - with a quiet dinner at home.
- You would?
Absolutely!
I'll just tell the pilot to turn the plane around.
No, wait!
Oh, that won't be necessary.
My goodness, we're 10,000 feet up.
Besides, I know how you have your heart set on it.
- Blanche, you're adorable.
- I know.
You know, I've dated a lot of women, and every single one of them has been impressed by the caviar and the expensive restaurants and the jet.
Hell, even I'm impressed by the jet.
I haven't been wealthy all my life, you know?
- Oh, really?
- No.
I started out in the shipping department of a large manufacturing company.
And after lots of hard work and long hours, ten years later, - I owned the company.
- Uh-huh.
And now, I own a lot of companies with branches all over the world.
And the amazing thing is, the work is just as exciting to me now as it was the day I started.
How about some champagne?
This isn't meant to impress you.
This is just to get you tipsy.
Oh, Richard, you rascal!
You know, I've made a lot of money and I've seen a lot of the world.
But there's still one thing in my life that's missing.
- What?
- Someone to share it with.
- I was hoping you'd say that.
- Did that champagne kick in yet?
No, but if you're ready to make your move, I can pretend it did.
Aah!
Oh, Dorothy, you scared me.
What are you doing up so late?
Honey, do you know what's behind that wall that you're banging on?
A lateral fusion pipe.
And do you know what's on the other side of that lateral fusion pipe?
- No.
- My head!
I'm sorry.
It's just that I was so excited.
I think I might have stumbled on something that could change the face of plumbing as we know it.
Oh, great, Rose!
Call the Ti-D-Bowl Man.
He'll jump in his boat and spread the news.
Oh, girls, I'm just so glad you're still up.
Wait till I tell you about my date!
- Wait till I tell you about my discovery!
- Let's hear it.
It came to me when I was enjoying my second cup of Ovaltine Richard flew me to Atlanta for dinner in his private jet!
You're kidding!
and that's when it hit me.
We don't even need our sludge tube.
Rose.
And then for dessert, he took me to this most romantic little bistro.
And while the waiter was glazing my peaches, Richard took my hand.
Know know what he said?
- What?
- Our biggest worry will be tank sweat.
Sorry.
He said that tomorrow, he wants to introduce me to his family.
If that is not the last step before a marriage proposal, - I don't know what is.
- Oh, that is wonderful!
Girls, I'm so excited!
Just imagine being Richard's wife.
I would be married to a gorgeous, intelligent man.
I'd be living like a queen!
Think about it in your room, Your Highness.
I need to use the throne.
You're a wonderful plumber's assistant, Dorothy.
Boy, you sure know your way around a snake.
I've had a lot of experience.
After all, I was married to one for 38 years.
We're right on schedule.
We ought to have that toilet tank in by sundown.
By sundown, by sundown!
Oh, this is such fun!
- I know.
- This is so exciting.
This is so depressing.
Oh, it's Saturday night, I'm all nervous and jumpy because in a few hours, there will be a handsome new toilet at my door.
What's going on here?
I walk into the bathroom, and instead of a toilet, there's a hole in the ground.
For a minute, I thought I was back in Sicily.
Sophia, I'm sure Blanche wouldn't mind if you use her bathroom.
I hate that bathroom.
There's plants everywhere and flowers on the toilet seat cover.
I feel like I'm going in the woods.
Gee, I hope that's our new toilet!
Now that's a sentence you don't hear every day.
- Plumber.
- Could I see some identification?
Come on in.
So you two are the proud parents of the new Dolan Standard Lowboy.
Yes, we're sending out engraved announcements.
You probably want to get her operational as soon as possible.
After all, she's quite a showpiece.
Where do I install it?
Well, actually, Lou, we're going to install her ourselves.
Follow me.
- Hold it.
You're not serious?
- Why not?
Ladies, the installation of a toilet's a very delicate procedure.
You got to go to school, you got to be a trained technician, you got to be a man, for God's sakes!
You know, to tell you the truth, Lou, women are capable of more than just cleaning these things.
Is that so?
Well, as long as you ladies are playing plumber, why don't you play moving man, too?
Fine, fine, we will!
- Was that a plumber?
- No, Ma, no.
It was a little girl selling Girl Scout toilets.
- You let a plumber get away?
- We don't need him!
Like hell!
I'm going after him.
Come on, Dorothy, let's move this little beauty.
- OK.
- Oh!
Ooh.
Wait, wait.
No, honey, she won't budge.
I don't think we're going to be able to move it.
If the Egyptians built the pyramids, now, we can move this toilet.
Fine, get me 20,000 Hebrews and I'll have it out of here in no time.
Oh, come on.
Give me a minute, I'll think of something.
I'd love you to meet my roommates.
Unfortunately, they're not home right now.
I'll talk to you later, darling.
Bye.
Bye.
- Oh, Blanche, I'm sorry.
- Oh, forget it.
Girls, I have something very important to tell you.
- What is it?
- Look.
He proposed!
Oh, Blanche, that is the biggest diamond I've ever seen!
- I know.
- Oh, I think this is wonderful!
It was wonderful!
It was beautiful, it was romantic, it was just everything I dreamed it could be.
Oh, Blanche, we're so happy for you.
Well, don't be.
'Cause I can't marry him.
Why can't you marry him?
You remember I told you Richard wanted to introduce me to his family?
I thought it would be his little old gray-haired mama and his spinster aunt.
- Turns out, he has two kids.
- Blanche, we've all got kids.
But these are seven and nine.
They're practically babies!
Babies need a momma.
Goodness, I've already raised my family.
I don't have the energy to go through that again.
Well, then Blanche, how could you accept his proposal?
Because it was the moment I've been dreaming about and everything was just so perfect and before I knew it, I said, "Yes.
" Only now, I have to tell him no.
But how can I say no to the man I love?
I can't even say no to the men I like!
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Blanche, honey, calm down.
Let's talk it out.
You'll feel better.
Oh, there's nothing to talk about.
I already know what both of you are gonna say.
Dorothy will say he's too good to give up over something like this and she'd marry him.
You'll say he's been nothing but trouble from the start and you wouldn't marry him.
- I'd marry him!
- Oh, I wouldn't.
What?
Well, no!
I don't want to be a mother again either.
Oh, I'd love to be a mother again.
Scrubbing socks, picking up toys?
Tucking in beds, packing healthy lunches.
- Phone calls, pajama parties?
- Dance recitals, baseball games.
- Cooking?
- Singing.
- Worrying?
- Praying.
Girls!
I thought we came in here to discuss my problem.
Sorry, Blanche.
I just hate myself for feeling this way, but I don't want to be a mother again.
I mean, it was a wonderful experience at the time, but I always thought this part of my life was supposed to be for me.
Honey, I understand exactly how you feel.
I feel the same way.
You know, at our age we should be grandmothers, not mothers.
Once a week, the grandchildren come over for a visit.
You cook them dinner, they spill it on the furniture.
They hide under your bed.
You hurt yourself looking for them.
They ask you what those spots on your hands are.
They tell you they love you and then just before total exhaustion sets in, they go home and become their mother's problems.
What about the good things, like Mother's Day?
Oh, the Mother's Days we used to have on the farm.
First of all, the kids would wake me up by brushing our cat, Mr. McTavish, against my ear.
Then they'd give me breakfast in bed - Belgian waffles and buttermilk.
And then they'd paint faces on their socks and do a little puppet show called "Elf Kingdom.
" And then everybody would tickle each other until the whole family was throwing up together.
Oh, dear.
I'm just so confused.
Oh, honey, listen.
You need more time.
Right now you're too upset to make the right decision.
Maybe you could spend a few days with Richard and his children.
- See how it goes.
- Oh, I don't know.
What if they hate me?
What if I hate them?
Honey, what if you all end up liking each other?
Yeah, I guess I could at least give it a chance.
OK, and that's what I'm gonna do.
Dorothy, I got to talk to you.
I owe you a big apology.
For what, Ma?
For what I said before.
About you not knowing a thing about plumbing.
Dorothy, you're a genius.
Ma, wait a minute.
What are you talking about?
I walk into the living room and there's a toilet in front of the television set.
It's an old lady's dream come true!
Grasp the valve tightly with your hand.
OK.
Turn it clockwise until scum gathers on your elbow joint.
Oh, I'm sorry, I skipped page 62.
Listen, Rose Rose, this is not working!
We've been here a whole week and nothing has gone right!
I'm ready to throw in the wrench and start using the Texaco station down the street!
Dorothy, don't panic.
You just need a break.
Why don't we just wash our hands and have a nice cup of tea.
Rose!
Turn it off!
I can't make it stop!
Very nice job, ladies.
- Who let you in here?
- I did.
Lucky I had his card!
Looks like we've taken a few wrong turns here.
For your information, this is exactly the way we wanted it to look.
Oh, yeah?
You got Siamese twins living here?
Look, Lou, we really don't need your help.
With all due respect, I think it's time you threw in the dishtowel.
I mean, trying to fix it yourself was cute, but you proved your point and it's time to let a man take over.
- I'm with Lou.
- Get your coat.
Lou is leaving.
Hey, not so hard!
I work with my hands!
You're making a big mistake.
The man may be a moron, - but he knows how to fix a toilet!
- It's fine with me.
The longer I let you do it yourself, the more I'm gonna get paid when you finally call.
Yeah, well, I have news for you, Lou.
We are not calling.
Ever!
You ladies haven't seen the last of me.
And you want to know why?
Because, as we say in the plumbing game, it's nev - Hi, girls.
- When did you get back?
Oh, a few minutes ago.
What a day!
I'm exhausted.
- Oh, where did you go?
- Bermuda!
Richard had a last-minute appointment, so it was just me and the kids.
Oh, we had a terrific time though - swimming and playing and talking.
They're lovely children.
- Does this mean you'll marry Richard?
- I don't know.
I don't understand.
If you and the kids hit it off, then what's the problem?
Well, I hardly ever see Richard.
Today was the third time this week he's had a last-minute meeting and I had to spend the day with the kids.
- He's a busy man.
- Too busy.
Even little Richard came up to me and said, "Now, don't worry.
This happens all the time.
" Little Richard was in Bermuda?
Yes, Rose.
He was burying Fats Domino in the sand.
Go ahead, Blanche.
Richard's always talking about how much his children mean to him.
And I know they do, but, you know, he hardly has time for them.
Or for me.
I'm starting to wonder if maybe the main reason he wants me for his wife is because he needs a mother for his children.
Honey, if you think that's true, you'd better find out.
I intend to.
I'm gonna ask him straight out at dinner tonight.
I just hope he has the answer I want to hear.
No.
No, no.
Don't worry, I'll be there tomorrow.
We'll handle the situation.
Tell Gresham we can get together next week.
No, he'll have to come here.
I can't go to the coast.
No, we're gonna have to try to keep that whole week clear for my honeymoon.
Some time around the 17th.
lif you can close it, all right, do so.
Call me.
I'm on the plane.
Sorry, dear.
To Blanche Deveraux, the most wonderful woman in the world.
- Now, Richard, you stop that.
- No, I mean it.
And my kids agree with me.
They're really crazy about you.
Richard, there's something I have to ask you.
- I have something to ask you, too.
- OK, you first.
Where would you like to go on our honeymoon?
I thought I'd surprise you and take you to Paris, but then I started thinking.
Maybe you don't like Paris.
Maybe you'd rather cruise to the islands or visit the Orient.
Richard.
Oh, I just love the way that ring looks on you.
So do I. - Richard?
- Mm?
You know I am very, very fond of you, but I think we have a problem.
A problem?
Let's look at it.
When you first proposed to me, the thing that scared me the most was the idea of being a mother again.
Especially to such small children.
I wasn't sure I could do it.
In fact, I wasn't sure I even wanted to do it.
But then I got to know the kids and I realized they aren't the issue.
The real problem is I'm third in your life.
Richard, you know your work comes first, then the children, then me.
And that kind of marriage just can't work.
At least, it can't for me.
Blanche, I can be there for all of you.
I can do it.
I've been able to do just about anything I set my mind to.
I know I can do this too.
Richard, nobody can do it all.
Now, as well as I get along with those kids, they need you.
They're growing up without you, Richard, and it's hurting them.
Right now, the most important thing should be the children.
Not getting married.
And not Gresham on the coast.
And not trying to squeeze in a week for a honeymoon.
Oh, this is the hardest thing I've ever tried to say to anybody.
You can't marry me.
Not now, not yet.
Listen, why don't you call up the kids and tell them they're spending tonight with their daddy?
And then, after awhile, if you still want to be a husband, why, you just let me know.
Bye.
Dorothy, do you want to do the honors?
Maybe later.
In private.
No, I mean fasten the floor flange.
That's all we have left to do.
No, honey, you go ahead.
Later, I'll break a bottle of champagne over the flush valve.
Oh, girls, it is beautiful!
I'm so proud of you!
Thanks, Blanche.
Hey, are you going out?
- Yes.
- Oh, I'm glad.
You know, we've been so worried about you.
I guess you can cry just so long and eat just so much.
Then you have to pull yourself together and get on with your life.
Besides, there'll be other Richards.
'Course, they won't be as charming or as handsome or as rich.
I'd better stop, I'm starting to depress myself again.
Sophia, look!
Isn't it wonderful?
What do you think?
Looks like a bathroom.
A bathroom that works!
And you were so sure that we couldn't do it ourselves.
Watch.
Girls, come on.
One, two, three!
Knock it off.
It's water, not oil.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Thank you for bein' a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for bein' a friend" I don't want to miss my appointment at the beauty parlor.
In a minute.
Dorothy's been trying to get through to the box office for 20 minutes.
I can't be late.
The last time I was late, Ronald gave me the broken hair dryer.
I came out looking like Don King.
Ma, please.
All my life I've wanted to see Frank Sinatra in concert.
I'm not getting off this phone until I get tickets.
What are you talking about?
I took you and Gloria to see him at the Paramount Theatre.
I'll never forget it.
From the second he stepped out on the stage, - I don't know, something happened.
- You fainted.
That's what happened.
I spent the rest of the evening in the ladies' room, trying to revive you.
Wasn't until a couple of years later that I got another chance to see Sinatra.
Stan bought tickets for my birthday.
But two weeks before the concert, he asked me for a divorce.
I got the house and the kids.
He got the tickets.
Don't think I didn't put up a fight!
Oh, girls, I have terrible news.
I failed my psychology exam.
I'm just beside myself.
Oh, Blanche, look on the bright side.
It's just one test.
Yeah, but this is my midterm.
I could fail the whole course.
If I fail this course, I won't get my degree, and if I don't get my degree, the museum won't even consider me for that promotion.
Oh, I guess there's no bright side.
Calm down.
You're gonna pass the course.
You're gonna have to buckle down and study a little harder.
At least you're doing well in your other two courses.
But those are art courses.
They come easier to me.
I've always had a great appreciation for the arts and artists.
And carpenters and mechanics and delivery boys.
Yes?
Yes, yes, yes, I'm still here.
Yeah, I'm calling about the Sinatra concert.
It's what?
What, you've kept me on hold all this time to tell me that it is sold out?
No, no, I will not have a nice day!
Oh, darn!
I was really counting on that concert.
Now what'll we do?
Don't worry.
I'll make some calls.
I got connections.
I'll handle it.
I'm gonna call a couple of ticket brokers.
Fine, big shot.
Handle it.
See how far you get.
I just remembered, I know somebody in show business who can help us.
My best friend in St. Olaf has a nephew who's a page at NBC in Hollywood.
I'll write to her and ask her to write to him.
Honey, won't that take an awful long time?
Oh, I don't mind.
I'm a very patient person.
I once waited two whole weeks for a sty to go away.
Every night, I'd close my eyes and I'd picture it getting smaller and smaller.
And one morning, I woke up and it was gone.
Ma, you OK?
I'm fine.
I'm just trying to make Rose go away.
Whose theory states "A young man becomes intimate with his mother to get revenge on his father"?
Well, I don't know who said it, but my second cousin Arlen did it.
I think we'd better try another question.
I am exhausted!
I went to at least a dozen ticket brokers today.
They all told me the only way I'm gonna get tickets is to go to a scalper.
Oh, you can't buy from a scalper.
That's a crime.
So is eating grapes at the supermarket, but you do that all the time.
- I have to test them.
- Rose, one is testing, 14 is brunch.
Good lord, I'm a criminal.
Fine, as long as you already have a record, I can count you in.
Tomorrow I am going to a scalper and I'm going to buy four tickets.
You'd better make that three.
My final exam is that night.
- Honey, that's too bad.
- Oh, what difference does it make?
My social life's gone down the drain anyway.
All I ever do is study.
You know, it cannot be good for you.
It's unnatural, it's unhealthy, it's unlike me.
No wonder I can't concentrate.
I need a break.
I need a change of scenery.
I need to hit Wally's Bar for Ladies' Night.
I'll see you all later.
Don't you girls wait up.
Hold it, Blanche.
I don't think you should go anywhere till you finish your homework.
Oh, I'll just be gone a few hours.
You get right back here and hit those books.
If you want a diploma, you have to apply yourself.
Do you think Bob Hope got all those degrees without studying?
Rose, let me handle this.
Listen, Blanche, nobody said that going back to school would be easy.
Easy?
It's impossible.
I cannot pass that course.
I just can't do it.
Listen, honey, if you're having such a problem, maybe you should talk to your teacher.
I can't do that.
I'd be too embarrassed.
- But that's what teachers are there for.
- I know exactly how she feels.
I used to be scared of my teachers, too.
- Get out of here.
- No, it's true, it's true.
Elementary school was a nightmare.
I was afraid to talk in class.
- Why?
- Well, I had a slight speech impediment.
It's different for kids these days, you know.
They have Barbara Walters to look up to.
Yeah, but in those days, it really stood out, you know.
Oh, I don't know, it must have taken three months before I could muster up the courage, you know, to talk to Mrs. Lenoff.
And it turned out to be the smartest thing I could have done, 'cause not only did she help me, you know, with the speech problem, she was the one who inspired me to go into the teaching profession.
You know what?
I think tomorrow after class I will talk to Professor Cooper.
Good girl.
What ever happened to your teacher Mrs. Lenoff?
Oh, gosh.
Last I heard, she retired from teaching, opened a bed and breakfast someplace in Wode Island.
Rhode Island.
- Professor Cooper?
- Yes?
What can I do for you?
If I might have a minute of your time.
'Course, if now's not convenient, I can No, no, please, please, sit.
I'm all ears.
Don't sell yourself short.
I don't believe we've been formally introduced.
I'm Blanche Deveraux.
- Yes, I know.
- You do?
- Mm-hm.
Of course.
- Oh, I'm flattered.
You're the only student who failed my midterm exam.
Oh.
What was it you wanted to see me about?
Professor Cooper, I suppose you are aware that I'm having the teensiest bit of trouble in your course, and to be frank, passing this course is very important to me.
So I was wondering if maybe you could give me a little help.
Oh, I see.
Well, Blanche, considering that you flunked the midterm, you'll need an A on the final exam to even pass my class, and the odds on that seem pretty slim.
But you see, I have to have these credits to get my degree.
Well, it's gonna take a lot of hard work on your part.
- You mean, like extra credit?
- Well, you could say that.
That's fine.
I'm ready, willing, and able.
I'll do whatever I have to.
Oh, I like your attitude, Blanche.
This is my home phone number.
Now, if you really want that degree, you'll use it.
You catch my drift?
Oh.
Oh.
Here we are, Sophia.
The perfect after-dinner treat.
- A nice dish of Jell-O.
- I hate Jell-O.
If God wanted peaches suspended in midair, he would have filled them with helium.
- What?
- Beat it, Rose.
I'm busy.
- What are you doing?
- It's Tuesday night.
I'm cleaning out my purse.
Did all that stuff come out of your purse?
No, I was also cleaning out my ears.
That's where the Feenamint and the rain bonnet came from.
Sophia, why are you in such a bad mood?
Forgive me, Rose, but I haven't had sex in 15 years and it's starting to get on my nerves.
- So, big shot, did you get the tickets?
- Can't you say hello first?
Hello, big shot.
Did you get the tickets?
Look, Ma, don't start with me.
I've had a very rough day.
The only scalper I could find had funny things moving in his hair, and he wanted to bargain in a dark alley.
- What seats did you get?
- I didn't get any tickets.
- I didn't think it was exactly safe.
- I can't believe you were such a baby.
In Sicily, we did all our bargaining in dark alleys.
How do you think I ended up with your father?
If the tickets are that hard to get, maybe we just weren't meant to go.
Maybe you weren't, Rose, but two weeks from now, I intend to be sitting in front of Old Blue Eyes himself, live, in-person, middle-aged spread and all.
Dorothy, you can take off a few pounds by then if you put your mind to it.
Oh, girls, I am devastated, just devastated.
Honey, what happened?
I asked my teacher for help, like you all told me to.
He said the only way I would get an A on his final is if I sleep with him.
- No!
- Oh, yes.
I just don't know what to do.
Get it in writing.
Blanche, that is terrible.
I hope you told him off.
First I was so stunned, I didn't know what to say.
Then I marched back up to his desk and I looked him straight in the eye and I said, "I'll think it over.
" Blanche, there is nothing to think over.
What he did is sexual harassment.
He cannot get away with that.
I don't know if I can pass this course on my own.
Oh, Blanche, believe me, in the long run, you'll be so much happier if you use your brains instead of your body.
I don't know if I can.
When I was little, I was always overshadowed by my sisters.
They were all smarter and more talented than I was.
Then when I was 16, I discovered I had a talent, too, the talent to drive men crazy with a body that many said should have come with a warning label.
Blanche, please.
After a while, I learned I could use my looks to my advantage, so I did regularly.
I've done it for so long now, I don't know if I can get by without it.
Well, maybe this is a good time to start.
Rose is right.
Listen, you're gonna get an A in that class.
We're gonna help you do it.
As far as that professor is concerned, you should report him immediately.
- You think I should?
- Absolutely.
When I first started teaching, the school principal pulled exactly the same thing on me.
- What did you do?
- I reported him to the Board of Education.
They investigated, and he was forced to resign.
'Course, much later, I found out that I was not the only person he had harassed.
I was, however, the only person he harassed while he was wearing a corset and high heels.
Well, at any rate, I spoke out, and because I did, a lot of other women didn't have to go through the same thing.
You know, you're right.
I have made up my mind.
I'm going to see the dean about Professor Cooper.
Very wise decision.
Nils Felander attempted to harass me repeatedly.
What do you mean, he attempted to?
He worked at Lars Erikson's Drugstore and Tackle Shop.
He was a soda jerk.
Now that I think about it, he was the town jerk.
Every Saturday afternoon, I'd go in and have a sundae.
Well, Nils would arrange the ice cream scoops in an obscene way.
I could never prove it, because by the time I would take it home to show my father, - the evidence had - melted.
To this day, every time I pass an ice cream parlor or a tackle shop, I blush.
Look, Coach, I want Leon off the team.
I don't care if he is 6'11" and weighs 300 pounds.
The boy can't spell his own name unless he copies it off his jersey.
I'm not gonna tell him.
You tell him.
You're the coach.
(knock on door - Dean Tucker?
- Come in, come in.
Look, we'll talk about it later.
Oh!
Oh, boy.
Problems, problems, problems.
My mother wanted me to be a priest, but no, I had to pursue the flashy world of academics.
- Oh, I'm Sit down, sit down.
- Thank you.
Dean Tucker, my name is Blanche Deveraux, and I have something extremely important to discuss with you.
Could this wait till next week?
I've only been dean here for a couple of days.
I haven't got a secretary, I can't get my parking validated.
I don't even know where the restroom is.
I was sexually harassed by Professor Cooper.
Oh, don't do this to me.
Please, I beg you.
Look We'll look into this first thing Monday morning.
- It can't wait.
- You're right.
We'll do something immediately.
We'II, uh, we'll fill out a form.
There must be one in here somewhere.
OK, Sexual Discrimination, Sexual Education Sexual Harassment.
OK, I'm going to have to ask you a few questions.
Well, Lord, I can't ask you this.
I can't even ask my own wife this.
I'd like to.
Dean Tucker, what happened to me was really quite simple.
I'm not doing very well in Professor Cooper's class, so he offered to give me an A i- if I would Do number five?
Actually, number five, six, and seven-B.
Why, that's terrible!
Were there any witnesses?
- No.
- Oh.
Oh.
Well, that complicates things.
Why, don't you believe me?
It's not a question of whether or not I believe you.
It's just without substantial evidence, it's just your word against his, and a man's career is at stake!
Well, so is mine, not to mention my dignity.
I'm sorry.
I really am.
I'd like to help you.
But unfortunately, there's nothing I can do.
- But that's not fair!
- Miss Deveraux, life is not fair.
I should know.
I'm 43 years old, and until today, I never even heard of 7B.
Well, I've known about it for some time, and as far as I'm concerned, you can go do it to yourself.
Oh, hello, Rose.
Blanche, you won't believe what happened to me today.
It was so exciting.
I've been waiting for somebody to come home so long, I thought I was gonna burst.
You won't believe what happened to me today in the dean's office.
I was driving down Biscayne Boulevard, listening to WREQ, the big band station.
I usually listen to WXDC, all talk radio, but this morning, a little voice told me to turn the dial, so I did, and I tuned in right in the middle of this contest.
They were looking for the 12th caller.
so I pulled over and I got my change ready I always keep two dimes in the crook of the door handle for emergencies and by the time I got through, I was the 12th caller.
I won four tickets to the Frank Sinatra concert!
Rose Nylund, you get your bohonkus back in here and listen to what I have to say.
Blanche, I'm sorry.
What were you trying to tell me?
I just don't know what I'm going to do.
Three tickets to Old Blue Eyes.
It's finally going to happen.
- But, Dorothy - Rose, please.
I went down to the auditorium today and out front, I saw a kid scalping tickets to this woman.
So I figured this is my last chance.
I raced over, took her aside, explained to her how much I'd always wanted to see Sinatra.
And guess what?
She let me buy the tickets!
It was that easy, just 'cause you said how much you wanted to see Frank Sinatra?
Yeah, that and that I only had three weeks to live.
- Dorothy - These are desperate times, Rose.
Boy, I'll say.
Today, when I went to the dean's office I got tickets, too.
This is such a coincidence.
I was driving down Biscayne Boulevard No!
No, no, no, please.
I cannot bear that again.
She was listening to her car radio big band, not all talk.
There was a contest.
Something about a little voice, a lucky number and a dime in a door handle.
Then bim, bam, boom, she won the tickets.
Take a lesson, Rose.
That's how you tell a story.
Blanche, here we've been running on about the concert, and you haven't even had a chance to tell your story.
Go ahead.
Never mind.
I don't feel like it anymore.
Honey, come on, we're sorry.
We're listening now.
You have our complete attention.
All right.
- I went to see Dean Tucker today.
- So, big talker - did you get your mitts on any tickets yet?
- As a matter of fact, I did.
- Three tickets, rear orchestra.
- Three tickets, third row center.
- Ma, how in the world did you get these?
- Easy.
I called Frank.
I told you I had connections.
You know Frank Sinatra?
No, Frank Caravicci from the fish market.
He's always been good to me.
Never a bad piece of cod.
- He knows Frank.
- Sinatra?
No, Frank Tortoni, the dry cleaner, Tina's third cousin once removed.
- Tina Tortoni?
- Tina Sinatra!
Ten tickets!
What are we gonna do with ten whole tickets?
I got it, I got it.
We'll go scalp them in front of the theater.
Oh, Rose.
After what we went through to get them, the least we can do is break even.
And believe me, whoever gets these tickets is gonna be very grateful.
- Now, what do you say?
- Oh, who cares what she has to say?
I have been trying for five minutes to tell you about my meeting with Dean Tucker, and all you two can do is go on about your silly concert.
Blanche, I'm sorry.
What can we do for you?
Nothing.
I've decided I have to do it myself.
Since the dean was no help whatever, I've decided the only one who can help me is me.
I'm going to show that Professor Cooper something.
Now if you'll excuse me, ladies, I have some tall studying to do.
Only first I think, as a reward for working so hard, I'll make myself an ice cream sundae.
Rose, I suggest you leave the room.
I may get a little crazy with the chopped nuts.
Pencils down.
- Well, where is everybody?
- Just you and me, Blanche.
Well, looks like we're finally at the crossroads.
Whatever do you mean?
I mean, I know you've been having trouble with this course, and I'd hate to see you have to repeat it.
Professor Cooper, I've been thinking about what you said, and I have no intention of repeating this course.
Good.
I'm glad you decided to take me up on my offer.
Oh, I'm declining your offer, but I do want to thank you.
- For what?
- Well, thanks to you, I studied all day and all night.
And whenever I felt like giving up, I would just think about what kind of man you really are, and I'd study even harder.
In fact, you made me so mad, I decided to get an A on this test come hell or high water, and I think I did.
I, sir, am a lady.
Maybe not the smartest lady in the world, but I do know that my self-respect is more important than passing your damn course.
So you, sir, can kiss my A. Oh, thank goodness you're I have been worried sick!
Do you realize it's almost two in the morning?
I was about to call the police!
You should have.
That's who we were with.
- What?
What happened?
- Look, I don't want to talk about it.
Oh, well, all right, but somebody tell me before I die of suspense.
My brilliant daughter scalped the tickets to an undercover policeman.
Ma, get off my back, huh?
You're lucky I was with you.
You'd still be in the slammer if I hadn't faked that heart attack.
My life will be ruined if this ever gets home to St. Olaf.
What'll they do, Rose?
Revoke your ice fishing license?
Take back your helmet with the horns?
I mean, I'm the injured party.
Obviously, I am destined to never see Frank Sinatra face to face.
They're called longenhodden.
What is called longenhodden?
The helmet with the horns.
- Why, for two - Wait!
Dorothy Girls!
Not one soul has asked me about my test.
Oh, Blanche, we forgot.
How did it go?
Well, I think I passed with flying colors.
But best of all, I told off that nasty old professor.
Honey, congratulations.
You're going to be a college graduate.
Oh, we're so proud of you.
Thank you, but I couldn't have done it without you girls.
Oh, now you can get that promotion at the museum.
Oh, no, didn't I tell you?
That position was filled.
Oh, you're kidding.
No, the museum director gave it to Sally Folgeson.
The money I spent on tuition, she spent on a tummy tuck and a butt lift.
Blanche, I hope you're not discouraged.
Oh, not one bit.
My time will come.
One day, her butt will turn to mush, but I'll always have my degree.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" - Stand up straight.
- I am standing straight.
You're slouching.
You try to pretend you're not tall.
- You do it all the time.
- I do not.
Yes, you do.
Ever since you changed schools in the fourth grade, the kids thought you were the substitute teacher.
Girls, I did it!
I finally broke down and bought that dress I've been eyeing for a month.
I thought you were gonna wear the silk one you wore to last year's banquet.
I changed my mind.
I decided too many people would recognize it.
It is such a stunning shade of green.
The only thing they'll remember is the way you fall out of it.
Oh, Sophia!
If you asked people the color, half of them would say flesh-tone.
Sophia!
Forgive her.
Ma's a little irritable today.
She doesn't have a date for the banquet.
I'm just being picky.
The banquet dinner's a big deal.
I don't wanna go with just anyone.
Well, I don't have a date yet either.
Blanche Deveraux can't find a date?
Oh, don't be ridiculous!
My only problem is trying to decide which of my many suitors to flatter with an invitation.
After all, it's the social event of the season.
I guess you'll just have to break a few hundred hearts, Blanche.
I know.
I haven't had to disappoint so many men since Daddy tore down the tree house.
Does anyone know where the aspirin is?
Buffered, time-release, or synthetic?
Time-release, I guess.
Capsule, tablet, or liquid?
Gee, I don't know.
Don't take the one with the childproof cap.
You could die before you get it open.
What's the matter, honey?
Aren't you feeling well?
- Just a little achy, that's all.
- Achy?
What kind of achy?
Headachy, stomach-achy, back-achy, what achy?
Dorothy, relax.
It's probably just a little cold.
She'll be all right.
Yes, but I won't.
I hear a story about somebody catching a cold and I get one.
I am very susceptible.
I have low resistance.
I have a tendency to be anemic, right, Ma?
- You're a hypochondriac.
- That, too.
- Achoo!
- Gesundheit.
- Excuse me, I'm sorry.
- Stay away from me, Rose.
Will you hold still?
If you don't let me finish, I'll never get this dress ready by Saturday.
If I get near her, I won't need it on Saturday.
I'll be home in bed.
Dorothy Don't worry, we'll all be at that charity dinner.
This is just an allergy.
Believe me, if I were coming down with something, I'd know it.
I wouldn't risk getting the rest of you sick.
You don't have to worry about me.
I never get sick.
I take very good care of myself.
I treat my body like a temple.
Yeah, open to everyone, day or night.
Oh!
I feel hot!
I feel cold!
I feel guilty.
This is all my fault.
Oh, no, Rose.
It's all my fault.
The minute I found out you were contagious, I should have thrown you out on the street.
I said I was sorry!
Oh, I feel just terrible!
My eyes are all puffy, my nose is red, my glands are swollen.
Isn't it amazing how I can feel so bad and still look so good?
I can't believe it!
Vinnie Bataglia, the biggest jerk I know, just turned down my invitation to the charity banquet.
If he's such a big jerk, why'd you ask him in the first place?
Because he's the only guy my age who doesn't wear his pants up to his chin.
I hate that.
Personally, that never bothers me.
It just looks so painful.
- Ma, do you mind answering that?
- Why not?
Maybe I'll get lucky.
What am I talking about?
If I was lucky, I'd be shacking up with Cary Grant.
Hello, I'm Dr. Richmond.
I'm looking for a Dorothy Zbornak?
It's a pleasure to meet you, but we were expecting Dr. Harris.
I'm afraid Dr. Harris couldn't make it.
His wife's having a baby.
Normally I'd be happy for her, but right now I couldn't care less.
What are you going to do for us?
Why don't you tell me the kind of symptoms you've been having.
Well, I have a fever and my throat is sore and my stomach is upset and I keep having this recurring dream where I'm being chased by a giant Listerine bottle.
And when I open my mouth to scream, all I can do is gargle.
Ah.
Are you experiencing the same symptoms?
Yes, except in my dream, I'm chased by a bottle of Scope.
Well, let's have a look at you, hm?
This is the first time a female doctor's ever examined me.
Feels kind of strange.
I hear that a lot.
You know, the truth is, despite the progress that women have made, medicine is still a man's world.
So, if it'll make you feel any better, I used to be a man.
- What?
- Just a little female doctor humor.
All right, so what's the verdict?
Well, ladies, the flu is going around.
I'm afraid you've all got it.
I told them that two days ago.
Tell them something new for $50.
How long is it going to last?
- We're talking at least a week.
- A week?
But we have to go to a banquet Saturday night.
Can't you give us a pill or something?
Sorry, ladies.
You're just gonna have to wait this one out.
Now, drink plenty of liquids, get lots of rest, and if you're not better by Monday, give me a call.
Oh, I can't believe it!
If modern science can come up with cinnamon dental floss, why can't they cure the flu?
Modern science is overrated.
Sometimes, home remedies can work a lot better.
You know, Sophia, you're absolutely right.
When I was a little girl, Mama used to rub eucalyptus oil on our necks and then tie a sock around to keep it warm.
It cleared your sinuses up just like that.
My mother always used to sing to us.
And make us gingerbread men.
Really, Rose?
I think Michael DeBakey does that before surgery.
In Sicily, we never went to the doctor.
We went to the Widow Caravelle.
Whatever you had, she had a cure.
She was best known for this green salve she used to make to treat ear infections.
One day, she gave a batch to Salvador, the village idiot.
He misunderstood the directions and put it on his linguine instead of in his ear.
I guess if you're an idiot with a hearing problem, you do things like that.
As it turns out, it wasn't such a bad thing to do.
The stuff tasted great and Salvador decided to market it.
At first, it didn't move so well.
Linguine With Ear Salve on a menu doesn't look too appetizing.
But once he changed the name to pesto sauce, it moved like hotcakes.
Ma, you're making this up!
So what?
I'm old, I'm supposed to be colorful.
Dorothy, where's my heating pad?
How should I know?
If this isn't it, I'd like to know what other electrical appliance you're using under that blanket.
You can't have it.
I need it.
My chest is congested.
What about my chest?
It needs heat, too.
I don't care about your chest.
I just care about my chest.
Well, you're the only one who does.
OK, Dorothy, slip this on.
Forget it, Ma.
I don't have the strength to stand up.
If you don't try it on now, I can't finish it by Saturday.
Who am I kidding?
I'm not gonna be able to go to that banquet.
None of us is.
We won't be better by then.
Fine, can I have your date?
Of course, Ma.
You can have my date, my dress, and my dessert at the dinner.
Just leave me alone with my thermometer and the one nostril I can breathe out of.
Great news, girls!
I found my folk medicine book.
It has a cure for everything.
I hope it has a cure for crankiness.
A lot of that going around.
Cranky, cranky, cranky.
Would it be under anything else?
- Try Dorothy.
- Try Blanche.
Oh, come on, girls.
Now, let's put on a happy face.
We'll get better much faster.
My cousin Dennis was the perfect example of that.
When he was 16 years old, he caught his sideburns in the hay baler.
- And then - Shut up, Rose.
Well, excuse me.
I didn't realize it was Gang Up On Rose Day.
I have been cooped up listening to your stupid stories for three days now.
You're just lucky it isn't String Rose Up From a Tree Day.
I'm not gonna let you two Gloomy Guses rain on my parade.
I'm just gonna keep on smiling.
Rose, you're sick as a dog!
How can you be so disgustingly cheerful?
It's my folk medicine book - it has the most wonderful Hot Toddy recipe.
Here, taste.
Rose, this stuff should have an octane rating.
I know!
Must you do that?
She can't help it, Blanche.
She has to blow her nose.
Or is that a banana?
You miserable Oh, would you two knock it off.
It's time for Another World.
You can't watch Another World.
- Why not?
- Because you watched it yesterday.
That's exactly why I have to watch it today.
To find out what happens.
That's why they always say, "Stay tuned for the continuing story of Another World.
" Too bad, Blanche.
Today it's my turn to choose.
And we are not watching Another Worldl Oh, you are undoubtedly the meanest sick person I've ever met!
Not to mention the most unattractive.
Girls, why do we have to watch TV anyway?
There are plenty of other fun things we can do.
We can play cards, listen to records, bake cookies.
Now, we can't let this nasty flu get us down.
It's bad enough we have to miss the banquet, must we also participate in a Girl Scout Jamboree?
I was just trying to be kind, courteous, helpful Well, knock it off!
I've had it up to here with your cheerful disposition.
Oh, do you think it's easy to be cheerful around you two?
You know how many of these stinking Hot Toddies I have to drink to keep on a happy face?
I'm not gonna do it anymore.
I'm not speaking to either of you!
And I'm not speaking to you, either!
- Me neither!
To either of you!
- Fine!
- Fine!
- Fine!
Great news!
I got a date!
Well, excuse me for trying to have a life!
Do we have any orange juice left?
No, we're all out.
All right, I want an answer and I want it now.
Which one of you has been dipping into my Vicks VapoRub?
I took it.
And my chest was already completely coated!
I did it out of spite because you lost the pre-measured cup off my Nyquil.
Rose, I took your stupid cup.
And do you know why?
Because I feel lousy, and being mean to you makes me feel better.
Dorothy Zbornak!
You can go straight to H-E-double hockey sticks!
Double hockey sticks?
Oh, what language!
My ears are burning!
Rose Nylund, you know what you are?
You are an A-1, first-class, all-around nerd!
Oh, honey, I didn't mean that.
I'm sorry.
Oh!
It's just this flu is making me crazy!
Oh, it's gotten to all of us.
Do you know that we have been at each other's throats for two days?
I've been the worst.
I hope you two can forgive me.
Oh, girls, let's make a pact.
Let's promise we're gonna help each other get through this mess.
Would I be too big a nerd if I asked for a group hug?
- Oh!
- Oh, honey, of course not.
- What are you doing?
- We're having a group hug.
Knock it off.
The neighbors will get the wrong idea.
By the way, I just called Harriet McConnell to cancel your reservations to the banquet.
Oh, thanks, Ma.
She was very disappointed you all aren't coming.
And I think it's because one of you won the big award.
You mean the Best Friend of the Friends of Good Health Award?
- Yeah.
- Why, what'd she say?
It wasn't what she said, it was what she didn't say.
What didn't she say?
How the hell do I know?
She didn't say it!
I read between the lines.
I wouldn't be one bit surprised if you won that award.
You know, I think you're right, Blanche.
Why, sure.
You took part in the walkathon and the bikeathon and the telethon.
And the marathon, but who keeps track?
Oh, Blanche, I think you have a better chance of winning that award than I have.
I think you have a point there, Rose.
Why sure.
You worked with the senior citizens, you put in time at the daycare center.
And you were the volunteer dummy for the firemen's CPR class.
And don't forget, that program was my idea, too.
O, maybe you're right, I might have a small chance.
After all, besides you, who else is there?
(clears throat Dorothy, please, why don't you use your handkerchief?
Doesn't anybody remember all the good work that I have done?
Not really.
I was co-chairman of the committee to raise funds for the new blood mobile.
I sold 49 cases of peanut brittle!
You really think selling candy's gonna qualify you for that prestigious award?
Oh, excuse me.
I didn't realize that slipping my tongue to half the firemen in the county was a more lofty social achievement.
Well, I guess that settles it.
I guess I won the award.
I'm gonna go to that banquet.
I'm gonna call my date.
Honey, if you can get a date the way you look, you deserve that award.
Why don't you call your date, too?
I would just love to have you there so you can eat your heart out when I accept the award.
Oh, don't worry.
I'm gonna be there.
Because I'll be the one accepting the award.
if you're both going, I'm going, too.
I have just as much chance of winning as you do.
You have done some good work, Dorothy.
But not enough people like you.
Sorry.
Ma, what do you think?
Do I have a chance of winning?
Absolutely.
As long as they don't add a swimsuit competition.
Doesn't she have the most adorable little sneeze?
It's OK, I didn't want my salad anyway.
- I'm sorry.
- Sucret?
Oh, no, thank you.
I'm still sucking on a Smith Brothers.
Well, good evening, everybody.
Ladies, you're certainly looking never mind.
Where's your date, Blanche?
Oh, he'll be along.
Never fear.
In plenty of time to see me win the Best Friend of the Friends of Good Health Award.
Blanche, you must still be running a fever.
You're hallucinating.
I am going to win that award.
Ha-ha-ha!
I'm sorry we're late, but we couldn't find the table.
But then I recognized Dorothy's hacking.
- Everybody, this is Raoul.
- It's a pleasure to be here.
Well, looks like we're all here.
Oh, there's my date now.
Why, he must be lost.
I'll just go get him and bring him over.
Tell me, where are you from, Raoul?
It's a pleasure to be here.
Raoul doesn't speak much English.
Ma, where did you meet him?
He owns a flower shop next to the dog track.
I won big yesterday, so I figured I'd treat myself and rent him a tuxedo.
- You having fun, Raoul?
- It's a pleasure to be here.
He kills me.
Everybody, I want you to meet my friend, Tommy Cochran.
Sit down, Tommy.
Tommy's a writer.
According to the New York Times, he is the most exciting new novelist to come along since Mr. Norman Mailer.
We met in the park last week.
I was sitting there, reading Tommy's latest book and he came over and offered to autograph it for me.
We've just been inseparable ever since.
Hey, Cochran!
What are you sitting with the guests for?
It's time to serve the main course!
You want me to come back after dessert?
No.
- Do I have to give back the $ 25?
- Yes.
I don't think that's fair.
Then give me ten and get out of here.
Well, what are y'all looking at?
All right, maybe I don't have a date.
Maybe my date took one look at me and said he'd rather die than be caught in public with me.
And maybe he's right.
Maybe I do look awful.
But think about this - I still look better than either one of you!
And so, after I threw up, I pass out in this tattoo parlor, right?
When I come to the next morning, just stinking to high hell, and I look down and I've got this scorpion tattooed on my belly.
But it's nice work.
You wanna see it?
No!
Where did you find him?
He's disgusting.
Well, at least I have a man.
Have one?
Sounds like you swallowed one.
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention, please?
It's time to present the Friends of Good Health's Best Friend of the Year Award.
But before we go any further, I have an announcement to make.
Don Johnson, star of Miami Vice.
who was originally scheduled to be here, will be unable to attend.
However, the producers of the show were kind enough to send over the clothes that he was planning to wear here tonight.
Girls, before she announces the winner, I just wanna wish you both the best of luck.
What harm could it do?
'Cause I'm gonna win the award.
Why don't you just shut up?
- Why don't you just shut up?
- Why don't you both just shut up?
And now, for the moment that you have all been waiting for.
The winner of the Best Friend of the Year Award is Miss Sophia Petrillo.
All right!
I'm very proud to win this award.
Who would have guessed an old lady with a tin can could raise so much dough?
I would like to thank you all for choosing me to be the Best Friend of the Year.
I'm a very lucky woman.
Not only do I have a lot of friends in this community, but I have a lot of good friends at home.
Friends who care about me and care about each other.
I count my blessings every day, because I have the kind of friends who stand by you through the bad and the good.
When you're lucky enough to find that kind of friendship, I guess you just want to pass it on.
Wait.
May I say a few words, just to my friends 75 and over?
I'd like you to take a good look at your dates for this evening.
Now take a look at mine!
Stand up, Raoul!
The man is half my age.
Isn't he gorgeous?
Let's give us both a big hand!
Girls, girls, I am so sorry.
Oh, so am I. Let's make a toast to friendship.
All to friendship.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" We're out of pepperoni!
I'm starving, and we're out of pepperoni!
I'm sorry, Sophia.
Would you like some celery stuffed with cottage cheese?
I can't eat cottage cheese.
It repeats on me.
Hello, hello.
Hi, Blanche.
How are you, sweet Mother?
- We're out of pepperoni!
- Did you call Dan Rather?
- I'm starving.
- I defrosted some chicken.
- We'll eat in half an hour.
- I can't eat chicken.
It repeats on me.
Ma, you don't have to make excuses.
If you don't want chicken, - just say "I don't want chicken.
" - I don't want chicken.
- Good.
- It repeats on me.
I want pepperoni.
Blanche, Blanche, would you like some broiled chicken?
Oh, no, thank you.
I'm having a raw vegetable plate.
You probably haven't noticed, but I've put on three pounds.
On each side.
I used to have a waist just like Scarlett O'Hara.
Well, you know that girl had an 18-inch waistline.
Blanche, that girl and her waistline were fiction.
It's terrible, just terrible.
I am so upset!
Rose, Rose.
Honey, sit down.
Sweetheart, tell us all about it.
Ma, would you get Rose some water?
What is she gonna do with water?
Has water ever made you feel better when you were upset?
Have you ever heard anyone say, "Thank God, the water's here"!
Call me when dinner is ready.
I'm fine, don't worry about me.
It's all those other people.
Was there some kind of accident?
No, don't tell me, if I get upset I'll eat!
- What happened, Rose?
- They closed the center.
- Not your Grief Counseling Center?
- No, the Kennedy Space Center.
She wanted to be the first Lutheran on the moon.
- Rose, you're out of a job!
- Well, I can't worry about that now.
Well, sure you can, honey.
I'll help you - food, clothing, shelter.
Oh come on, it's not that serious.
Yes, it could be.
Rose, you and I are in the same boat.
If we miss a couple of paychecks, we are in big trouble.
Thank God I had the foresight to marry money.
Tramp!
Dorothy, my main concern is making sure those miserable people can find other sources of help.
Then I'll get a job.
I'm dependable, friendly, loyal, eager.
That's great.
If she learns to catch a Frisbee in her teeth, - she can get work as a golden retriever.
- Oh.
Hello.
Hello.
- I'm Dorothy.
- Milton.
- Oh, pleased to meet you, Milton.
- Likewise.
- I live here.
- Oh.
You don't.
- I live over on Dorado.
- Ah.
It's about a 20-minute walk but I usually take the bus.
Are you waiting for one now?
No, I'm learning to get in touch with my emotions.
Tell me, will it take long?
You know, you're reading my Newsweek.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh, Dorothy, I see you met Milton.
Oh, yes.
We were just getting acquainted.
Dump him, Rose.
He's driftwood.
Oh, no, Dorothy.
Milton's from the center.
His partner ran off with his wife and all the money from the business.
Oh, Milton, I'm sorry.
Keep the Newsweek.
Here's the address of a private counseling service, In the meantime, my number's down there.
Now, don't hesitate to call anytime, day or night.
- Thanks again, Rose.
- Oh, you're welcome, Milton.
- You let me know how it works out.
- I certainly will.
- And no more tears.
- All right.
Bye.
He's such a royal pain in the butt but it's all part of my job.
You don't have a job, remember?
I haven't forgotten, Dorothy.
I've just been too busy to start looking.
You haven't even started looking?
Don't worry, will you?
I will get a job.
There's always a job for people who aren't afraid of hard work.
That's what my father used to say.
He was talking about milking cows in Minnesota!
- Here, phone messages.
- Oh, thank you, Sophia.
If you have to go out tomorrow, ask those crybabies not to call during The Young and the Restless.
Mr. Viner's depressed.
Mrs. Gibson's despondent.
Mr. Duvalier's been deported.
- Why, oh, why, can't grief take a holiday?
- Oh, it does, Rose, it does.
Eventually, it comes to Miami like everyone else.
Oh, my God.
I don't believe it!
Barry Glick is in town.
Oh, I haven't seen him since high school.
Barry Glick!
Ma, Ma, look, look - Barry Glick!
Oh boy, did I have the hots for him!
He says he wants to get together next week!
- You're gonna see him?
- See him?
If he's within 50 pounds of where he used to be, I'm going to marry him!
Oh, Barry Glick.
Oh, and Mrs. Montez found her cat.
I'll bet she's happy, too.
Not exactly.
She found it under a Jeep Wagoneer.
Rose!
Rose!
Rose, will you wake up?
You have a call.
Is it time to milk the cows, Daddy?
No, kitten.
You have a phone call.
What did you say, Dorothy?
You have a phone call.
It's your friend, Milton.
No, I can't believe he's calling at this hour!
Well, you told him to call day or night.
I didn't mean it.
It's an expression, like "Laugh and the world laughs with you.
" Well, the whole world doesn't really laugh.
That's because they're too busy calling here in the middle of the night.
Good night, Rose!
I hate phone calls in the middle of the night.
Now I'll never get back to sleep.
I'm as jumpy as a virgin at a prison rodeo.
Boy, that's pretty jumpy.
- Well, didn't the phone scare you?
- Well, of course it did.
One of those times I really miss having a man around.
They're so good at answering the phone in the middle of the night.
That's not all they're good at.
And when they're really good, you don't even hear the phone.
Ma, why are you sitting here in the dark?
Why not?
I've seen the living room before.
Look, look.
I've got to get some rest.
Tomorrow I am seeing Barry Glick for the first time in 35 years.
If I don't get at least six hours' sleep, I look like Buddy Ebsen!
- Now that you mention it - Shut up, Blanche.
Oh, I know it.
You're right.
It's just terrible.
If I get up in the middle of the night, I eat.
Wait a minute, you know something?
We're being selfish.
I mean, Rose's problem is more important than my date.
- Or my losing two pounds.
- Three pounds.
- She has to face reality.
- I am.
I already lost one pound!
In your dreams.
I'm talking about Rose.
She has to find a job.
She's been out of work for over a week.
I am really sorry about this, girls.
It won't happen again.
- We can all go back to bed.
- No, wait.
Rose, sit down.
Move over, move over.
Now, listen.
We have something to talk to you about.
We are worried about you.
Now, maybe it's none of our business, but all that time that you spend with those pathetic wimps from the center, - you should spend looking for a job.
- But those wimps need me.
But Rose, honey, you have your own problems.
Look.
You are 55, unemployed, your husband is dead, and you have no training.
Let's face it, Rose.
You're not exactly Mary Lou Retton.
Honey, we know it's not easy, but you got to get out there and try.
I have tried.
I just haven't told you.
I've had dozens of job interviews since the center closed.
No one wants me.
I can't afford not to work.
I need something to do with my life.
I never think of myself as old, but everyone else does.
Maybe I am old - old and useless and terrified.
- (knock on door - Come in.
Oh, Rose.
Rose, honey, now why didn't you tell us what was going on?
Because you can't help me find a job.
Because nobody or nothing can make me young again.
Oh, all right, Rose, so your life isn't the same as it used to be.
The rules have changed, but it's happened before, hasn't it?
I mean, what did you do after Charlie died?
Buried him.
I mean, what did you do the next day when you had to start putting your life together?
I couldn't do it.
I'd been a housewife for 32 years.
I totally depended on Charlie.
But the point is, eventually you did what you had to do.
You took care of yourself.
Sweetheart, you're now in exactly the same position.
Not exactly.
I'm five years older and nobody wants me around.
Oh, honey, we want you around.
We just can't afford to pay you.
Rose, Rose, look at me.
Rose, listen.
You are feeling sorry for yourself.
Sure, you're five years older - so am I, so is Blanche.
All right, you have a few more wrinkles - so do I, so has Blanche.
All right, you're a little thicker around the middle - so is Blanche!
Listen, we are not going to stand by and just let you give up.
We're gonna figure out what it is you're doing wrong on these interviews.
We're gonna fix it, and we're gonna try and get you some more appointments.
Appointments are the easy part.
I've got one tomorrow.
I'd kill for this job - hospital administrator - but I'll never get it.
- I'm not qualified.
I'm too old.
- What time is your appointment?
- 8:30.
- All right, let me see your resume.
Come on, come on, come on.
OK, now, let's see.
Let's see.
Home ec major at Rockport Community College, six months at St. Paul's Business School, laid off from your job at Grief Counseling.
Hobbies - cheese making stamp collecting, and Viking history?
- Rose, this stinks.
- Well, it's the truth.
Honey, sometimes you have to stretch the truth.
Of course you do.
Now, let's see.
Graduated top of your class.
Intensive post-graduate study.
until you moved to Miami.
Currently seeking work in the private sector.
Voilà.
This is the resume of a potential hospital administrator.
Well, I don't know if I can pull it off, but I'm willing to try.
Oh, good.
Now we can get some sleep.
Oh, I can't fall asleep now.
Still at the rodeo, Blanche?
I can't sleep, either.
Why don't I make us all some warm milk?
After I drink milk, I go right to sleep.
I can think of something else after which I go right to sleep.
Huh, Dorothy?
During.
- Girls, we can't drink plain milk.
- Why not?
It's disgusting.
If we're gonna have milk, we need cookies.
Hell, if I'm gonna have cookies, I'm gonna have cheesecake.
- Is there cheesecake?
- Chocolate cheesecake.
- You bought chocolate cheesecake?
- Just for an emergency.
- What kind of emergency, nuclear war?
- Depression.
Oh, you'll never guess what I found!
Judge Crater.
Cookies and cream ice cream - my favorite.
Wait a minute.
We're eating dessert.
We can't start with dessert.
We better have something to begin with.
Sure.
You can have some lemon chicken and smoked ham.
It's all prepared.
- Oh, let's just start with appetizers.
- That's fine.
- How about smoked oysters?
- Oh, good.
Ohh, you'll never guess what I found!
- Jimmy Hoffa.
- Pepperoni!
- Uh-oh.
- Don't tell Mom.
- That could be an appetizer.
- Well, this is good.
- This is all food that would have spoiled.
- Oh, boy.
I am so glad that my date with Barry is tomorrow.
- The fat won't have time to show.
- It won't?
No.
It always takes a few days before it shows.
Where does it go in the meantime?
To Connecticut!
How do I know where it goes?
With me, the minute it goes in my mouth, I balloon up.
I can go out to dinner, and in the middle of the meal, my pants are cutting off my circulation so bad, my feet are turning blue.
Well, I just want to be svelte for Barry.
Barry Glick is very important to you.
Barry was the man that I wanted to be the first.
First where?
On Mars, Rose!
My first lover.
- Well, so what happened?
- Stanley - that's what happened.
Stanley.
I went to a drive-in with Stanley.
He said he was being shipped off to Korea and would probably die and it would mean so much.
That was my part of the war effort.
It took three seconds.
I wasn't sure that we had done anything, actually until nine months later when the baby came.
Then I figured out that we had.
You know, that was my only proof.
I waited till my wedding night.
No!
- Yes!
- And?
And, it was a surprise.
Well, how is that possible?
Another man showed up?
What I mean is I had never seen a man before.
A man?
You know a man.
- No!
- Yes!
What about your father?
You mean, you never saw your father?
My father?
Oh, no!
My father?
Oh, my goodness, no!
I would have simply died!
- Oh, you don't Oh, my God!
- Easy, easy, easy, Rose.
- Calm down, calm down.
Easy!
- All right!
The only things I ever saw were the animals on the farm - you know, the bulls and the horses.
Tough act to follow.
Actually, that first night I was kind of, well appalled, I guess.
But Charlie was very patient.
It was really very nice, once I understood that that's what you were supposed to do that it wasn't some colossal joke, you know?
I mean, didn't you think it was a ridiculous thing to do the first time?
No!
Well, I certainly didn't wait for my wedding night, honey.
I couldn't.
I had these urges.
You know, in the South, we mature faster.
I think it's the heat.
I think it's the gin.
Anyhow, my first was Billy.
Oh, I remember it so well, just like it was yesterday.
That night under the dogwood trees, the air thick with perfume, and me with Billy or Bobby.
Yeah, Bobby.
Yeah, it was Bobby or was it Ben?
Oh, who knows?
Anyway, it started with a "B".
That first time did you have?
Are you serious?
Why, many times that first time - many, many times!
- You did?
- You didn't?
No!
Oh, it was nice - being near Charlie was nice - but it was five years before I knew what made your eyes go back in your head.
Dorothy, did you have?
How could I?
I mean, it always seemed to happen before I was in the room.
- Look what we've eaten!
- Oh, and I can't sleep on a full stomach.
Look at what time it is.
Would you like some coffee?
Sure.
How 'bout some Danish?
It's almost breakfast.
- Hey, want some eggs?
- Sure!
- Do we have any bacon?
- Yeah.
- Scramble me a couple, but - Scramble soft!
(overlapping chatter You're a wonderful woman, Blanche.
No offense to Rose, but I'm glad she wasn't here when I dropped by today.
Why Milton, what a sweet thing to say.
That must be why I date more than she does.
And I meant what I said about that diet of yours.
Men of our generation like a little meat on their women.
Maybe you don't want to pinch an inch, but I do.
Ooh, ooh, Milton!
- See you tonight at 7:00.
- Tonight at 7:00, then.
Good afternoon.
I thought he belonged to the other one.
Well, I'm sure Rose won't mind one bit.
He's a man.
It's not like sharing a yogurt.
- Hello, hello, hello!
- Hi, Dorothy.
- Honey, did Barry call?
- Not that I know of.
- We're supposed to go out again.
- Sounds like lunch went well.
Oh, we had such fun.
You know, Barry is exactly as I remembered.
Come on, now.
After 35 years, there must have been some surprises.
A few.
You know, his hair's a little thinner, he's put on a little weight.
But is he still your fantasy lover, or has the fantasy become a reality?
Well, not exactly.
You see, Barry Glick is gay.
I knew he was gay.
I could tell by the way he used to worship Buster Crabbe.
- Oh, honey, are you just devastated?
- Oh, hey, what the hell?
If I can't have him, at least I know no other woman can have him, either.
- Hi, girls!
- Oh, hi there!
Hey, are we to assume from your cheerful demeanor that we are talking to a new hospital administrator?
Not even close!
Oh, what did you do, take an anti-depressant?
Oh, don't be silly.
But I was depressed - incredibly depressed.
I didn't know which way to turn or where to go, so I stopped in at the coffee shop at the Fountain Rock for a root beer float to make me feel better.
They make the most terrific root beer float.
They have that old fashioned root beer Now look, Rose, get off the float.
Just get to the point.
Well, after I drank it, I started to get sad again, and then I saw the answer right in front of me.
- What, what?
- A "Help Wanted" sign.
- Oh?
- And, and?
I am a waitress at the Fountain Rock Coffee Shop!
minimum wage and tips, and a 60% employee discount on day-old Danish.
A coffee shop?
- Day-old Danish.
- Yeah!
serving chili to a bunch of grubby truckers?
Oh, come on, Blanche.
I mean, she's working at the Fountain Rock.
It's not Mel's Diner.
I mean, the worst that can happen is she'll get scratched by a pinkie ring.
But 12 hours on your feet waiting tables?
Honey, that is gritty, grimy, grueling work!
But it's work!
It beats the hell out of feeling sorry for myself, and it'll be a lot nicer to fall asleep from being tired than crying.
Of course it will.
Oh, Rose, honey.
Rose, I am so happy for you.
Well, heck, if you're happy, then I'm happy, too.
Oh, thank you for seeing me through this.
- I wanted to ask you about Milton.
- Yes.
That is strictly a professional relationship?
Oh, absolutely!
Oh, there couldn't be anything between Milton and me.
He has this thing about only dating fat women.
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
Thank you for being a friend Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Oh, Lily, honey, how do you like your steak?
Oh, medium's fine.
- Why are we cooking outdoors?
- Ma, we're having a barbecue.
Do you know what they call cooking meat over an open fire in Sicily?
- No.
What?
- Poverty.
- Gee, those steaks smell good.
- What do you know, Rose?
You thought you could go out in the ocean and catch fish sticks.
Oh, I just love barbecues.
We used to have the most wonderful ones back home.
I can remember sitting out under a big old tree with the Darcy triplets - Hank, Beau and Dove.
Eating and talking and laughing.
And then along towards the end of the meal, why, the boys always got into a fight over who was going to get to lick the barbecue sauce from my fingertips and kiss away the little droplet of butter that always drizzled down my chin.
Has it gotten awful hot out here?
I'll go get the lemonade.
We used to cook outdoors all the time when we were kids.
- Remember our camping trips, Lily?
- Oh, I sure do.
During the summer, our father would take the whole family on camping trips into the wilderness.
Of course, it wasn't really the wilderness.
He'd drive in circles for about 20 minutes and then end up in the woods just beyond the barn.
It was years before all the kids caught on to Dad's trick.
What do you mean, just beyond the barn?
Here we are.
A nice, fresh pitcher of ice-cold lemonade.
Pour me a cup, would you?
I'm sweating like a horse.
Here, Sophia, let me get it for you.
- That's OK, honey.
I'll do it.
- No, now, Rose, please.
I told you when I first arrived I didn't want any special treatment.
I'm sorry.
It's been nearly six months now since I lost my sight.
And I've learned to cope with just about anything.
You know, when I was in college, I taught school part-time at one of those schools for the blind.
It is really amazing what they can accomplish.
Oh, I went to one of those schools for a little while.
It's just a lot of talking and hand-holding.
Never been so bored in my life.
I think I'm just the kind of person that likes to get out there and do it.
Did you know that my sister Lily still holds the record at our high school for the 100-yard dash?
She served three terms on the city council, and she was the first woman in St. Olaf's to ever have a pilot's license.
Oh, really?
Well, we have something in common, Lily.
I was the first woman in my hometown ever to have a pilot.
Blanche's bed is next to the X-15 at the Space and Aviation Museum.
Would you be interested in going to an outdoor concert tonight?
Oh, you couldn't drag me out of this house tonight.
St. Elsewhere's on.
That's my favorite program.
I never miss it.
- You still watch television?
- Well, I don't really watch it.
- I just pretend it's radio.
- We don't exactly watch it, either.
With our crummy TV, we get two channels at once.
For a while there, I thought Benson was having an affair with Miss Ellie.
Listen, Mom, we cannot afford a new TV.
We're using the household money to repair the roof and repave the driveway.
Great.
And what am I supposed to do while every other old lady on the block is watching Cosby?
You can sit in the new driveway and hope that an amusing black family drops by.
Maybe we could sell our old TV and use the money towards one of those new stereo models.
Sell it?
Honey, I don't think we could give it away.
Oh, you would be amazed at the things people will buy.
When I moved from my house into the apartment, I had a garage sale and I made a lot of money.
'Course, I probably would've made a lot more if I could tell a one from a 20.
Ooh, girls, let's do that.
Let's have a garage sale.
Well, can we get in trouble having a garage sale?
I mean we're not actually selling a garage.
If it's a choice between the two of them, let the blind one make change.
Isn't it amazing that three people could accumulate so much stuff?
Will you look at this.
I got this doll on my tenth birthday.
Oh, I can't believe I've kept her all these years.
Her hair is falling out, her clothes are all worn, she smells of mothballs.
Hey, I may not be Ann-Margret, but I'm still your mother.
Girls, look at this!
Look at this!
You know, I remember wearing this outfit the night George took me to Woodstock.
Oh, what a night.
I will never forget it.
Listening to the music of Mr. Richie Havens and Mr. Bob Dylan, and then making love in the mud.
You went to Woodstock?
Well, actually it was the movie, but afterwards we did go home and make love in the mud.
I guess the 60s were a confusing time for all of us, Blanche.
Oh, gee, I'd forgotten I had these candlesticks.
They were Mother's.
Oh, they'd be perfect for the alcove table.
- Oh, let me do it.
- Oh, no, wait, Lily.
- Now, Rose, I'm fine.
- No, I'm just gonna get your cane.
No, I don't need that.
Last night I memorized the layout for the whole house.
Now, please stop treating me as if I'm totally helpless.
I'm sorry.
You know how I am.
I guess I'm overprotective.
Who invited Gidget to the garage sale?
Girls, I'm feeling a little chilly.
I think I'll go and get my sweater.
- Oh, no.
I'll get that for you.
- Rose, for heaven's sakes.
I can find my own way.
I know you're trying to help, but if I could pilot my own plane cross-country during a storm, I can certainly find my way across the room.
There!
Now, do you see that I don't need anybody's help?
Oh, my God!
Rose!
Rose!
Rose, help!
Oh, wait!
Don't get over there, darling.
- Come over here.
Stand back.
- What was it?
It's all right, it's all right.
She's putting it out.
There we go.
It's all right.
Is everyone all right?
Oh, everyone's fine.
We just had a little accident.
Well, we didn't have a little accident.
Lily had a little accident.
- Blanche, please.
- I'm sorry.
I guess I'm not used to your stove.
Maybe you shouldn't have been cooking on it, darling.
- Well, somebody could've gotten hurt.
- I said I was sorry.
It was an accident.
Let's be fair.
It could've happened to any one of you.
Rose, Lily can't go on like this.
You have to do something.
Well, I think you girls are overreacting.
I mean, it was just a little grease fire.
- No harm done.
- This time!
- What if nobody'd been home?
- Rose, it's not just the fire.
What do you expect me to do?
There's nothing you can do, Rose.
She has to learn to do things for herself.
Honey, maybe she ought to go back to that school.
Well, you heard her.
It's not for her.
She's a very independent person.
No, she's not, Rose.
Not till she learns to be independent as a blind person.
I'll talk to her.
Rose?
Yes.
Lily, I just I know, you wanted to see if I was all right.
Rose, really, I'm fine.
I've been having accidents since I was two years old.
This is not a major crisis.
You don't have to worry about me.
Well, it's hard for me not to.
I know.
That's because you're a worrier.
I remember when you were six years old and Dad got you that puppy for your birthday.
You worried because you thought her paws were too big and that the other dogs would laugh at her.
Well, they did!
They used to bark and point at her.
Everybody pointed at her.
You made her wear a bonnet and matching booties.
Don't change the subject on me, Lily.
Honey, I'm worried about you.
Oh, Rose.
You'd be worried if you couldn't find anything to worry about.
- And stop pouting.
I was only teasing.
- How did you know I was pouting?
You always pout when I tease you.
- Always?
- Always.
You're a pouter, Rose.
- A pouter and a worrier.
- Well, maybe you're right.
But I think I have a good reason to be worried this time.
Lily, I think you're trying to do too much by yourself.
I've never been one to depend on other people, Rose.
You know that.
But this is different.
You're not trying out for the track team in high school.
You're trying to learn to cope with daily life as a blind person.
Do you see this dress, Rose?
It's my favorite.
It's awfully pretty.
It's my favorite because it's the only one I can clearly remember.
I remember what it looks like.
And I remember what it looks like on me.
And because of that, I wear it all the time.
- You will adjust, Lily.
- I don't want to adjust!
I want to be the person that I used to be!
But you have to face the truth.
You need help!
Now, you can deal with it, but you can't do it all by yourself.
Rose, all my life I've done everything I wanted to do.
Nothing's ever stood in my way before.
For the past six months, that's how I've been trying to deal with everything.
I thought that I could overcome this thing by myself.
I guess that deep down inside, I thought I could make it go away.
But I can't.
Every morning when I wake up, it's still there.
And that terrifies me.
Rose, I do need your help.
That's why I came to Miami.
To ask you to come home with me.
Oh, Rose, please come home with me!
I can't make it by myself.
Oh, honey.
So I think the best thing I can do is move back to Lily's place in Chicago.
It'll be a lot easier for me to get used to new surroundings than it would be for her.
You really think you moving to Chicago is gonna solve Lily's problems?
I want to help her.
Oh, but I don't think you're helping her by offering to be a nursemaid.
- I mean, Lily is not an invalid.
- You don't understand.
All our lives, Lily was the one who always took care of me.
It doesn't matter what I think is best for her.
If Lily wants me to take care of her, I can't refuse.
Well, seems to me that part of the reason you're doing this is out of guilt.
- Maybe you're right.
- Honey, it's a terrible thing to do something out of guilt.
Believe me, I know.
Just about the time that George and I were getting serious, he was shipped off to Korea.
Well, I wanted to do my part for the war effort, so I took a job in a factory that made canteens.
I figured that one of the canteens that I had riveted would somehow find its way to George, and his lips would drink from the galvanized spout I had so lovingly fashioned, thereby symbolically reuniting us.
Oh, Blanche, that's a beautiful reason to take that job.
Well, that wasn't the only reason.
That factory also had a comprehensive dental plan, and I was in desperate need of a bridge and two crowns.
War is hell.
So were my teeth.
Anyway, while I was working on that assembly line, why, I met a young man named Andrew Beandorf.
It was just a platonic thing.
We just went out to the movies and dinner.
But when George came home on leave, he was furious.
He accused me, unjustly, of infidelity while he was off fighting in some foreign land, some godforsaken land where people didn't even believe in Jesus.
And he forbade me ever to see Andrew again.
So, of course, I didn't.
So you lost a good friend just because George made you feel guilty about it.
That's right.
I lost a good friend and a wonderful companion and an excellent lover.
An excellent lover?
Did I say "excellent lover"?
Oh, no, I meant excellent riveter.
I can understand how you could confuse the two.
Anyway, the point is guilt is a very bad thing.
Story over.
I was just talking to Lily.
I hear you're moving with her back to Chicago.
- That's right.
- Good idea.
Now you can ruin your life and hers.
I got dibs on Rose's room.
Sophia, you just don't understand.
Please, Rose.
What I forgot, you'll never know.
Tell her, Dorothy, how bad off I was when I had my stroke.
You were really sick, Ma.
You know, in the beginning, she couldn't walk, she couldn't talk, she couldn't even feed herself.
All I could do was sit and feel sorry for myself, which is what I did all the time.
But you got better.
Yeah, because she stopped coddling me.
She screamed, she hollered, day and night.
She made me do my therapy.
She forced me to rebuild my life because she knew I could.
- And for that I'll always be grateful.
- Oh, thanks, Ma.
I only have one question.
Now that I'm better, why do you still scream and holler at me?
I'm not sure what was best for you is best for Lily.
Look, you didn't ask for my opinion, but I'm old, so I'm giving it anyway.
You want to help your sister?
Help her to help herself.
Sophia, that was a very sweet thing for you to do.
Hey, Rose is a good kid, and I like her a lot.
But after all is said and done, I would sell Dorothy to the gypsies to get that bedroom.
- How much?
- Two bucks.
Get wild - treat yourself.
- Nah, I'll give you a dollar fifty.
- What does this look like, Baghdad?
Get the hell out of here!
Ma, that's no way to sell things!
Hey, go to Neiman Marcus sometime, see if they treat you any better.
- How we doing?
- Honey, I don't think we've sold a thing.
I don't get it.
I'll give you a dollar for these Elvis Presley salt and pepper shakers.
A dollar?
I will have you know the day I bought these salt and pepper shakers at the Graceland gift shop, I thought I saw the King himself walk by, eating a giant chili cheeseburger and drinking a 36-ounce Dr. Pepper.
Turned out it was an impersonator, but these are still very precious mementoes.
And parting with them is an extremely painful sacrifice on my part.
- A buck and a quarter.
- A dollar and a quarter?
Sir, if that is the respect you have for genuine Elvis memorabilia, then I kindly suggest you hand these over and remove yourself from my property.
Blanche!
Blanche, I can't believe that you did that!
I mean, they're just a silly salt and pepper shaker.
The King is gone, Dorothy.
But we must cherish the things he left behind - his movies, his songs And his seasonings.
Oh, give me that!
No, this was a mistake.
- What's going on?
- Oh, Mr. Longfellow got in by mistake.
He is not for sale.
Isn't that right, Mr. Longfellow?
Yes, it is, Rose!
Rose, in my opinion, it is time to say bye-bye to Mr. Longfellow and Elvis.
I mean, what's the use of having a garage sale if we can't part with anything?
- How much for this hockey stick?
- $1100.
- Dorothy!
- This isn't an ordinary hockey stick.
Bobby Hull used this.
This is a piece of history.
It's a piece of junk.
And the price tag says four dollars.
- Four fifty.
- I'll take it.
Uh, OK, but listen.
Before you go, come into the house with me.
I'll show you the kind of wood oil that I use on it.
Wood oil?
Are you buying that?
'Course not.
Everyone knows you use paraffin wax on parched wood.
Come on.
- Six dollars!
- No!
- I'll give you ten!
- I don't want to sell it back!
I'll give you 25 and don't ever show your face around here again!
Sold.
He didn't want it.
He said there's a nick in it.
We have to have a return policy.
Oh, girls, listen.
Let's face it - all that so-called junk out there has too many fond memories for all of us.
We're never gonna be able to part with it.
We might just as well call this whole garage sale off.
And kiss our new TV goodbye.
Isn't that right, Mr. Longfellow?
- (high-pitched Yes, it is, Rose.
- Please!
Listen, I have a great idea.
It's a little strange, it's a little bizarre, it's slightly off the wall, but it just might work.
- What is it, Dorothy?
- Why don't we each take $ 20 from our pockets, make a down payment on a new TV, and then pay the rest off on time.
Sounds good to me.
Let's go tell everybody that the sale's over.
You wait right there.
I'll be right back.
- Rose?
- Yes, Lily?
Could you help me get to the sofa, please?
Oh, sure, honey.
Here you go.
Thank you.
You're not getting tired of me yet, are you?
Oh, don't be silly.
Oh, Rose, I really appreciate what you're doing for me.
- I really do.
- Don't mention it.
Could you please get me a glass of water?
Sure.
Lily, you've been here a week now.
You know where the kitchen is.
Well, I figured the way I've been crashing into everything, you'd rather get it.
Maybe you should get your drink of water yourself.
I thought you said you'd look after me, Rose.
Lily, if you can't even get yourself a drink of water, you're helpless.
- And that scares me.
- How do you think I feel?
Well, I think you're scared too, but you won't admit that you need help.
Professional help to get on with your life.
Oh, I've given this a lot of thought, Lily, and I really think it's the best way.
Rose, you're not coming back to Chicago with me, are you?
No.
How can you turn your back on your own sister?
I'm not turning my back on you.
I love you.
I'm just trying to do what I think is best for you.
What you think is best?
What do you know about being blind?
Oh, Lily, this is very painful for me.
Please don't make it any harder than it already is.
I'm sorry, Rose.
I'm sorry.
I promise, I won't ever ask you for anything again.
All right, I'll see you in a week.
Now, I'll call myself collect tonight and you'll tell them I'm not home and that way you'll know I arrived safely and you won't have to lie to the phone company.
Goodbye.
Bye.
- I forgot my purse.
- Oh.
I know I'm forgetting something else.
I know it, I just know it.
Oh, come on now, Rose.
Calm down.
Are you sure you wanna go through with this?
Oh, yes.
Lily and I have barely spoken since she left.
That was two months ago.
Oh, I can't say no to Lily.
I have to go.
I mean, I said no to her when she asked me to come live with her, but I can't say no when she asks me to come visit.
And I know she's gonna ask me to come live with her again, and I'm just gonna say no.
I think.
I'm such a wreck!
You know, you could just cancel your reservation and think it over one more day.
No.
I think you should go and stick to your guns.
Right.
I've made my decision - I'm gonna stand by it.
No matter what happens, I'm not gonna turn back.
I forgot my raincoat.
Silly.
- Now what'd you forget?
- I forgot to kiss you two goodbye.
- Oh, goodbye, sweetie.
- Goodbye.
Come on now, come on now.
Get out of here.
You come back more times than Shirley MacLaine.
Thank you for flying Air Florida.
Hope you enjoyed your flight.
Thank you for flying Air Florida.
I hope you enjoyed your flight.
Oh, I certainly did, and I want to especially thank you for that pillow from first class.
- They're so much fluffier.
- Oh, you're welcome, but that was Julie.
I'm the one that got you the Dramamine and the packs of smokehouse almonds.
Can I bother you one more time?
Ten packs is all I can give you.
I told you that on the plane.
I just want to know which way to the baggage claim.
Oh, thank you.
And thanks again for the wings.
Rose?
I knew that was you.
Lily!
- Oh, honey, what are you doing here?
- I wanted to surprise you.
- Oh!
- Surprise!
- Did you come all this way by yourself?
- No, I came with Becky.
Well, Becky, how do you do?
Oh, Rose.
I had to see you again because I felt terrible about the way we left things.
- Oh, so do I. - Oh, Rose, I owe you an apology.
I was angry at the world because I couldn't see it anymore.
That's why I wanted you to take care of me.
I didn't think it was worth the effort to do it myself.
But you didn't give me any other choice.
So I went back to that school.
And once I got out there and started learning a few things, I realized that the effort is worth it.
Oh, I still have a long way to go, but Becky and I are doing OK.
Oh, I feel so silly.
I came out here to talk some sense into you, and you didn't even need me.
Oh, yes, I did, Rose.
I needed you to see that you were right.
Now you Excuse me, Becky.
You take my arm.
I'm gonna lead you.
Now, Rose, you always had a terrible sense of direction.
You take my arm - I know the way.
It's 49 steps right down this way.
And watch out for the wad of gum on the 41 st.
- I'm so proud of you.
- Oh, this is nothing.
Wait till you see me drive home.
Come on, Becky.
One, two, three

Thank you for being a friend Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Morning, Ma.
Taste this.
Mm.
Oh, it's awful.
What's the matter with it?
It's expired.
But sometimes it's good after the date.
I just wanted to check.
You look tired, Ma.
- Rose kept me up all night.
- Oh, why?
I don't know.
She was afraid of the storm.
knocks on my door, crying, begging, pleading to get into bed with me.
Just like your father used to do before we got married.
So what did you do?
I told him, "You're not getting anything till you put a ring on my finger and a donkey in my father's barn"!
Not Pop, Rose!
I told her to get the hell out of my room.
Oh, Sophia, I want to explain about last night.
When I was a little girl, one summer we had a terrible thunderstorm Excuse me, Rose.
Have I given you any indication at all that I care?
Girls, my father's coming!
Big Daddy's coming!
He just called!
Oh, Big Daddy's gonna be in Miami tomorrow.
I can't believe it!
I can't believe I know anyone who calls her father Big Daddy!
Back home, everybody calls him Big Daddy.
Why, he's the most respected and beloved man in our town.
Oh, for as long as I can remember, people from all over the county would drive up to Twin Oaks that's the name of our house to ask Big Daddy's advice on one thing or the other.
And while the men were discussing business on the veranda, the ladies would retire to the shade of an old magnolia to sip mint juleps and exchange prize-winning pecan pie recipes.
Tell me, Blanche, during any of this, would the farm hands suddenly break into a chorus of "Them Old Cotton Fields Back Home"?
Well, maybe I am exaggerating just a touch, but not about Big Daddy.
Oh, he's a very special man.
He has truly been a father to everybody in our town.
Your mother must have been a very forgiving woman.
Oh!
I got a million things to do before Big Daddy gets here.
I have to go pick up his favorite food and his favorite brandy and cigars.
I want him to feel right at home.
Then get the Millers across the street to tar and feather their lawn jockey.
I'm gonna go out on the lanai for awhile.
The air's always so nice and fresh after a storm.
As long as you're out there, Rose, why don't you pull some weeds?
OK.
Ma, yesterday you said you were gonna pull the weeds.
I said I'd get it done and it's getting done.
So lighten up.
Dorothy, Sophia, come quick!
Oh, my God!
The storm must have knocked it down last night.
Good morning, ladies.
- Morning, Mr. Barton.
- Good morning, Mr. Barton.
Well, looks like you had a little bad luck here.
Boy, we certainly did.
Any damage to your place?
Nope.
Not a scratch.
Oh, thank goodness.
If the wind had been blowing in the opposite direction, your tree could have fallen into your living room.
What do you mean, my tree?
She means your tree because it was on your property.
No way, lady, this is your tree.
It's your responsibility.
Oh, my goodness!
Our tree fell into your yard!
Clam up, Gladys.
This is their tree.
Look, there seems to be some confusion here.
But we are neighbors, what do you say we split the cost and have the tree hauled away?
What do you say you have it hauled away and I'll split.
That does it!
You don't have any choice.
You're hauling that tree away, capisce?
You Italians have got some temper!
"You Italians"?
With disdain in his voice, he said it.
Now you're gonna pay.
What are you doing?
It's the Evil Eye.
I just put a Sicilian curse on you.
You're not gonna have a moment's peace till you haul that tree away!
You got me shaking in my boots.
Come on.
Oh, Ma, why'd you do that?
You just made matters worse with that ridiculous curse.
Ridiculous?
The curse works, believe me.
I've used it before.
- Oh, when?
- Baltimore Colts, New York Jets, 1969.
Draw your own conclusions.
Ah, great news!
I stopped by the courthouse this morning and got a copy of our property map.
The tree definitely belongs to Mr. Barton and it is his responsibility to remove it.
Play it safe.
Stick with the curse.
Oh, Ma, I've stayed with you all these years.
Ladies, how do I look?
Like the night hostess at Denny's.
This is exactly like the dress I wore to my Sweet 16.
It was always Big Daddy's favorite.
(doorbell Oh, there he is now!
Now listen, girls, my father is an old time southern aristocrat who is used to fine manners and gentility.
So please, please, please be on your best behavior.
Why is everyone looking at me?
- Daddy!
- Where's the old lady?
Ah-ha!
You looking for me, mouth?
Ma.
I'm glad you're here, Mr. Barton.
I went down to the courthouse this morning and This isn't a social call.
This morning, when I got in my car, somebody let the air out of my tire.
- I know she did it!
- That's ridiculous!
If I catch her on my property, I'm gonna have her arrested.
Mr. Barton, I assure you, my mother had nothing to do with your tires.
- It was just a coincidence.
- Coincidence, my eye.
Now, about the tree.
I got a copy of our property map at the courthouse this morning, and as you can clearly see, the tree is yours.
Oh.
I'm not gonna move it.
- Not after what she did.
- You have to!
- Sue me!
- We will!
- Fine!
- Fine!
That jerk!
Trying to intimidate us!
Just who does he think he is?
(doorbell What is it, mouth?
Back home, most people start off with, "How do"?
- Daddy!
- Baby girl!
Looking at you takes my breath away!
Hair as shiny as the dew on a field of sunflowers.
Eyes that sparkle bluer than the Mississippi, and the prettiest smile on either side of the Mason-Dixon Line!
Didn't I tell you my daddy was the smartest man who ever lived?
You must be Sophia.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Excuse me for staring, ma'am, but I've always felt that the stunning, classical beauty of an Italian woman should be admired like a fine work of art.
You need boots to listen to this guy.
Daddy, I want you to meet my best friends.
This is Rose.
- Charmed.
- Hello, how do you do?
Has anyone ever told you you are the spitting image of Miss Dinah Shore?
Oh, no!
You're putting me on!
Of course he is.
And Daddy, this is Dorothy.
I'm sorry.
I hope I didn't offend you.
No harm done, darling.
Now, I want you to promise me you won't fret none.
Well, I would, except I'm not exactly sure what "fret none" is.
Oh, Daddy, I'm so glad to see you!
- Get on over here and sit down.
- Oh, I can't stay, honey.
- I've got some business to attend to.
- Oh.
But I'll be back later tonight.
I got a surprise for you!
Oh, did you get me something?
What is it?
- What did you buy for me, Daddy?
- Well, nothing, sugar.
Oh, fiddle-dee-dee.
Fiddle-dee-dee?
This is so much fun!
It's like being in Gone with the Wind.
Well, then what is the surprise Daddy?
Well, I was gonna save it, but what the heck?
I'm singing at the Sagebrush Club tomorrow night.
You're doing what?
I'm singing.
That's my surprise.
And I want you and your friends to come as my guests.
But why?
Because, darling, I thought they might enjoy it.
No, no, I mean why are you singing?
It's my calling.
It's what I do now.
I'll explain it all to you later.
Right now, I got to head over to the club and check things out.
- But, but Daddy?
- Leave the key under the mat.
Ladies, see y'all later!
Uh, I can't believe it!
Neither can I!
Free tickets!
No, I'm talking about my daddy!
Why, this singing thing doesn't make any sense!
You know, I'm worried about him.
Maybe I ought to go call my sisters.
Oh, come on, Blanche, you're overreacting!
If you're really concerned, why don't you talk to him?
You're right.
That's what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna stay completely objective and keep an open mind.
I'm sure there's some perfectly logical explanation why my daddy's lost the stuffin' out of his comforter.
Oh, sorry, darlin'.
I didn't mean to wake you.
Well, that's all right.
I waited up for you.
I'm glad you did.
I've been working on a new song and I want you to hear it.
Listen, Daddy, I want to talk to you about this singing.
It's been just wonderful, honey.
I love singing.
Now, I know I'm just getting started and I got a lot to learn, but the audiences will come around.
I'll do just fine.
You know, you're talking about this singing like it's some kind of career.
Well, it is.
Now, see what you think of this.
This part needs a little work.
And then now, here's the chorus.
No you won't, Daddy.
Now, put that guitar down, I wanna talk to you.
What's the matter?
Well, I don't know what's gotten into you.
Daddy, you're no singer.
Well, I know I'm no Hank Williams yet, but No, no, no, that's not what I meant.
I mean At your age, just out of nowhere to decide you're just gonna go off and perform in some honky-tonk?
I don't know about you, but that sounds pretty crazy to me.
Now, don't you sass me, missy.
No, I don't mean to sass you, Daddy.
It's just that I'm concerned about you.
Now, I want you to promise me that you're gonna forget all about this nonsense and go back to Twin Oaks and have a nice long rest.
There's no Twin Oaks to go back to.
I sold it.
You what?
!
Sold it.
Sold everything.
Well, now, if I'm gonna go out on the road and do this thing right, I need money.
All right, this has gone far enough!
I will not allow you to disgrace yourself or your family!
I absolutely forbid you to go on with this foolishness one minute longer!
You forbid Big Daddy?
You're the one's gone crazy, girl!
I'm sorry you had to witness this spectacle, ladies.
My apologies.
- Oh, Big Daddy, wait.
- Too late!
You know, if there was some rain coming down, and a soft train whistle in the distance, this moment would have the makings of a first-rate country song.
Bye, Blanche.
Oh, I feel awful, just awful!
I shouldn't have lost my temper that way.
- Honey, you were upset.
- Well, that's no excuse.
Daddy obviously doesn't know what he's doing.
He's lost his grip on reality.
Oh, honey.
Maybe it's not as serious as you think.
Maybe he's just going through a stage.
My father is not off on some crazy lark, Dorothy.
He sold our house and our land and everything he spent his lifetime building.
He needs help.
I never thought this could happen to my father.
Other people's parents get old and grow frail and need taking care of, but somehow I'd always thought Big Daddy would go on forever.
Honey, we all think of our fathers that way.
We remember them as strong and handsome and wise.
When I think of my father, I always picture him pulling a giant tuna up Main Street.
Well, who doesn't, Rose?
Oh, it wasn't a real tuna, it was made of chrysanthemums.
It was the float in the Father's Day Parade.
You probably don't know this, but my home town was founded by Heinrich von Anderdonnen the first man to ever can tuna in it's own natural juices.
Anyway, it was the 50th anniversary celebration of the founding of our town and my father was chosen to pull the float.
He thought it was 'cause he had the newest tractor, but actually, it was 'cause he was the only one small enough to fit into the mayonnaise jar costume.
Oh, I'll never forget the moment we caught sight of him, turning off of Sycamore on to Elm.
Something must have happened to the tractor, 'cause there he was, this lone little mayonnaise jar dragging this giant tuna up the hill, past the reviewing stand.
I don't think I've ever been prouder in my life.
That's very touching, Rose.
It shouldn't be, but it is.
You know, when I think of my father, I don't remember just one incident.
I just know that he was always there to take care of me whenever I got into trouble which was all the time.
I just never dreamed that the day would come when the tables were turned and I'd have to take care of him.
But I guess it has.
Sophia, why don't you come with us?
It might be fun to hear Blanche's father sing.
To you, Rose, but what do you know about a good time?
(doorbell Oh, Mr. and Mrs. Barton, what can I do for you?
- I wanna see the witch.
- Leonard!
Don't call her a witch, you'll get another boil on your butt.
Tell the world, Gladys!
Look, you've won.
I'm begging you, take off the curse, will you?
My golf clubs are missing, my clocks are all wrong, I can't sleep, I can't eat!
You can't sit.
That, too.
Please take it off.
- Move the tree.
- It'll be out of here tomorrow.
You got a deal.
Does that mean it's gone?
That means I shouldn't eat asparagus at dinner.
That means it's gone.
Let's get out of here, Gladys.
I'll be right there.
I just wanted to apologize to you ladies.
Leonard has been just terrible about this whole situation.
That's why I did all those things to him.
Oh!
It was you all along!
Except for the boil, that was just luck.
Gladys, we've got to go.
Listen, ladies, if there's anything that I can do for you to improve our relationship, I'd be happy to oblige.
There is one small thing.
In the morning when you go out in your robe to pick up the newspaper, wear your shorts.
I've never been in a place like this.
Are these all real cowboys?
Of course, Rose.
You can tell because they wear cowboy hats and drink wine spritzers and drive Volvos.
Uh, Blanche, who do we see about our table?
Oh, I don't know.
This is the first time I've ever been here.
Well, howdy, Blanche.
Hi there, Blanche.
Ladies.
No, I'm wrong.
I think the museum did have its Christmas party here.
What's that noise?
Oh, they have a mechanical bull in the back room.
I read about it in the Sunday supplement.
What on Earth do you do with a mechanical bull?
Introduce him to a mechanical cow, Rose.
Oh, excuse me.
We're supposed to have reservations for the second show.
- The name's Devereaux.
- OK, let's see.
Uh, hm-mm.
I'm sorry, I don't seem to have you listed.
Oh, well, maybe it's under the name of Hollingsworth.
- Hollingsworth?
- Mm-hm.
Uh, you're not here to see Big Daddy Hollingsworth?
- Yes, we are.
- I'm sorry, you just missed him.
But we thought the second show doesn't start until nine.
It doesn't.
But after the first show, the management cancelled his booking.
Oh!
I was afraid that would happen.
Do you know where he went?
I guess he's backstage somewhere.
You go on honey.
Talk to him.
We'll wait right here.
Thank you.
Howdy, ladies.
My name's Rusty.
I don't recollect seeing you two fillies 'round these parts.
Mind if a lonesome cowboy puts his saddlebags 'round your campfire?
Give us a break, would you, mac?
Howdy, ma'am, my name's Rusty.
Daddy?
Sugar.
I didn't expect to see you here.
Daddy, I just heard what happened and I'm so sorry, I truly am.
Oh, don't worry.
It's my own fault.
If I wasn't such a stubborn old fool - Daddy, now don't be hard on yourself.
- Well, it's true.
I never should have tried that Beatle medley.
Next time, I'm gonna stick with the material I know.
You mean you intend to go on with this?
Why not?
Honey, because they didn't like you.
That's why not.
You weren't any good.
Honey, I know I'm not any good.
- Then I don't understand.
- What?
Well, I don't understand how the man I have admired and respected all my life can turn himself into a clown.
Blanche, honey, ever since I was a boy, I've never been satisfied with what was easy.
I always wanted to try new things, see new places.
But before I had a chance to do something like hop a tramp steamer, I met up with a lady by the name of Elizabeth Ann Bennett.
She had the cutest little smile, tiniest button nose, and the most incredible blue eyes I had ever seen.
Those are the things you inherited from her.
And when I looked into those eyes, they told me it was not time to go off chasing rainbows.
It was time to make a life for the two of us.
And I never regretted that decision because I knew that someday, we'd go off chasing those rainbows together.
But when the time finally came, all that was left was a big empty house.
And a headstone that marks her grave.
And I decided that before it was time for us to be together again, I was gonna go off and have that adventure.
Now granted, this is no tramp steamer, but it's something.
Something I've always wanted to do.
And sugar, I think that now is finally the time to do it.
But why didn't you tell me that before?
I didn't think I needed to.
I figured if I was happy, you were happy, too.
Oh, Daddy.
I'm so sorry.
You've always been there for me.
I should've been there for you.
And, you think you could ever forgive me?
Darlin', life's too short to not forgive my favorite little girl.
- I love you.
- I love you, too.
{END OF EPISODE 24}{START OF EPISODE 25}
Thank you for being a friend Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" - Oh - Oh, Dorothy!
What do you mean sneaking up on me like that?
You scared me half to death!
I'm sorry, Rose.
Next time I walk into a dark room in the middle of the night, I'll send a mariachi band ahead of me.
What are you doing up?
- I thought I heard a strange noise.
- What kind of strange noise?
Like someone walking slowly up creaking stairs.
We don't have stairs.
I know!
How strange is that?
What are you doing?
Well, I thought I heard a prowler outside.
Oh, my God, Dorothy!
Why didn't you call the police?
Oh, no, no.
It turned out it was a neighbor's cat trying to mate with our plastic flamingo.
What is it?
I heard screams!
What's happening?
No, nothing.
Everything's fine, Blanche.
We never should have watched Psycho.
For 25 years, I have avoided that picture, even when Stan invited me to the Roxy instead of over to his mother's house for dinner.
And it turned out that my instincts were right - Norman Bates is scarier than my mother-in-law.
And a much better dresser.
Oh, I never should have watched it, either.
It always upsets me - especially that shower scene.
Why, it's the reason I prefer not to shower alone.
Sure, Blanche.
And Goldilocks and the Three Bears is why you prefer not to sleep alone.
- Well, at least we're not alone tonight.
- Oh, boy.
You know, there is nothing worse than being wide awake and scared and by yourself.
Oh, yes there is: being wide awake and scared and by yourself without a double-fudge chocolate cheesecake in the freezer.
Ah!
I'll get the silverware.
I feel better already.
You know, I never used to do anything like this with my old roommates.
You had roommates before us?
I never knew that.
Oh, yes.
Two very eccentric old ladies who used to bathe together and floss each other's teeth.
I kicked them out one morning, and that very afternoon went down to the supermarket to advertise for new ones.
That was when I first met Rose.
- Are you OK?
- Oh, I'm fine.
Oh, I know exactly what you're going through.
- I can read it in your face.
- You can?
Oh, sure.
Your husband or your boyfriend dumped you.
Oh, honey, don't let it get you down.
It's just the nature of the beast.
They'd do it in the mud if they had to.
You just go sleep with his best friend.
That'll even up the score.
Am I on Candid Camera?
- You mean, you didn't get dumped?
- Well, actually, I did by my landlord.
He threw me out of my apartment, but I couldn't sleep with his best friend.
He's over 80 years old and thinks he's the Archduke Ferdinand.
Why did he throw you out?
Well, the new owners of the building don't allow cats, and I'm not about to part with Mr. Peepers.
Oh, I guess you two have been through a lot together, huh?
Yes, I found him last week.
But I wouldn't feel right having a home if he didn't.
We've become very attached.
You know, I think that shows great strength of character.
I like you and I like cats.
I also happen to have a room for rent, and the name is Blanche Devereaux.
Why would you name a room Blanche Devereaux?
That's very good.
I like a roommate with a sense of humor.
My last two roommates were two old sticks-in-the mud from Minnesota.
Oh!
Tell me a little bit about yourself.
Well, my name is Rose Nylund and I'm from Minnesota.
- Stop it, girl.
You're killing me.
- Oh, but I'm not a stick-in-the-mud.
Oh, listen, I can let my hair down and get crazy with the best of them.
Really?
Hey, I think we'd get along great.
- I got a feeling you're a wild woman.
- Oh, you bet I am.
I eat raw cookie dough.
And occasionally, I run through the sprinklers and don't wear a bathing cap.
And at Christmas, I've been known to put away more than one eggnog.
- What's the matter?
- I think I'd better keep looking.
Oh, I'll stop eating raw cookie dough.
No, honey, that's not it.
It's just the two of us have nothing in common.
We're just two different kinds of people.
It wouldn't work out, believe me.
- Can I pet your cat, lady?
- Why, sure, sweetheart.
- What's his name?
- Mr. Peepers.
I had a cat just like him.
His name was Harpo.
But he died.
I miss him.
Oh, well, you'll have to get yourself another kitty.
Would your mommy let you have another kitty?
Yeah, she said she would get me one next week.
Well, if you'll promise to give him a really, really good home, - I'll let you have Mr. Peepers.
- Great!
- Would it be OK if I call him Harpo?
- Well, I don't think he'd mind.
- Thanks a lot, lady.
- Yeah, there you go sweetheart.
Mom!
Say, Rose Look, now, I'm not making any promises, but how would you like to take a look at that Blanche Devereaux room?
Really?
I'd love to.
- Come on, let's go.
- By the way, what's your name?
That last remark was the reason I didn't let you move in that same day.
But after I saw what I had to choose from, you seemed like a gift from heaven.
You wouldn't believe some of the people I interviewed.
Well, I think that about completes our tour, Madame Zelda.
Anything else I can tell you about the place?
Yes.
Was a young woman in a nurse's uniform murdered in this house with a handsaw?
Heavens, no!
Are you sure?
I'm getting a very strong vibration.
I see a woman in a white uniform, writhing and screaming.
And there's a man kneeling over her.
If it was last Wednesday, that was me and the gentleman I'm currently dating, but that was a French maid's uniform.
(doorbell Mrs. Devereaux, you must leave this house at once.
It's possessed by an evil spirit.
Actually, it's possessed by Miami Federal.
And at seven percent, you couldn't blast me out of here.
- Yes?
- Are you Blanche Devereaux?
Yes, what can I do for you?
Well, I'm Dorothy Zbornak.
This is my mother Sophia Petrillo.
Remember we spoke on the phone about sharing the house?
Yes.
Come in, uh-huh.
Move in this house and you'll die an agonizing death.
Thank you, Madame Zelda.
Goodbye.
Oh, ladies, I'm sorry about that.
You get so many weirdoes when you run an ad in the newspapers.
Please sit down.
Well, are you ladies considering taking both rooms?
Oh, no.
Just me.
Mother lives at the Shady Pines Retirement Home.
Oh, the Shady Pines.
I know the Shady Pines: it's a lovely place.
It's a prison.
They lock us in our rooms and force us to look like we're having fun.
Then they take pictures for their brochure.
Ma, you know that's not true.
You'll have to excuse my mother - she recently had a stroke, and her perception is a little, you know, distorted.
- Oh, I understand.
- No, you don't.
Why don't we start out with a tour of the house and later on we'll sit down and go over that application you filled out.
Wonderful.
Oh, your house is just breathtaking.
I know.
You said it looked like a dump from the outside.
This is the lanai.
It is wonderful in the summertime.
Especially if you like to sunbathe with your top off.
Oh, really, really?
And the neighbors can't see in.
Oh, sure they can.
The woman has "slut" embroidered on her underwear.
Dear things, I'm afraid I'm running a little late.
- May I just ask you a few questions?
- Well, of course.
Go right ahead.
What do you call an inhabitant of Guam?
I don't know.
A Guamanian, I guess.
What does this have to do with renting the room?
Oh, nothing.
I just wanted to finish my crossword puzzle.
Now, then, Dorothy, would you say you are a very neat person?
Oh, yes.
Very, very neat.
Please.
You're neat and I wear a D cup.
At that moment.
I was convinced I'd blown it.
I was sure I'd made a bad first impression.
But then I met Rose.
and I realized I could have shown up naked.
playing a ukulele and still gotten the room.
Oh, it's been such a lovely day.
Mr. Sunshine really gave us one of his biggest and brightest smiles.
Oh, I feel like putting my arms around Mother Nature and giving her a big kiss.
- Hi, you must be Dorothy.
- And you must be Mrs. Rogers.
No, but we have a Mrs. Rogers at the Grief Center.
Oh, and there's a Mrs. Rogers lives across the street.
Then of course, there's Dale Evans, the most famous Mrs. Rogers of them all.
I didn't catch your name.
I'm Rose Nylund, your new roomie.
Blanche has told me all about you.
Sorry your husband dumped you.
You can borrow my bubble bath anytime you want.
That'll help ease the lonely nights.
Thank you very much.
I see you two are getting acquainted.
Yes, I'm just gonna take my stuff to my room.
It's the second on the left down the hall there?
Dorothy, the second on the left is mine.
Blanche had promised it to me.
Blanche promised it to me too.
Didn't you, Blanche?
Whoops.
Oh, great, great.
What are we supposed to do now?
Back in Minnesota, we'd settle this kind of a dispute with some good-natured logrolling.
Sorry, Rose.
My log is in the shop.
What do we do now?
Toss a coin?
- OK.
- All right.
- I'll take tails.
- OK.
Tails, you win.
I'll make it up to you, Dorothy, I promise.
Listen, if there's ever a night where you can't sleep, I'll come to your room and sing "Kumbaya.
" Rose, I don't know what to say.
Yes, I do.
Don't ever do that.
Well, Rose, what do you say we help Dorothy move her things, OK?
OK.
Gee, this is fun already, being roomies with you two.
- Oh!
- Oh, Blanche!
Blanche, I am so sorry.
Oh, I'll buy you another one.
Well, you can't.
That was one of a kind.
Oh, well, don't feel bad.
I never really liked it much anyway.
It's just that my grandmother gave this to me.
On her deathbed.
She was very, very sick for a very, very long time.
I loved her very, very much.
Blanche, why don't you just grind the broken pieces in her hand?
Blanche, I know I can't replace it, but I wanna make it up to you.
Listen, since this is our first night as roommates, I'd like to invite the two of you to dinner at my favorite restaurant.
- Well, that's very sweet of you, Rose.
- Well, thank you, Rose.
Then we'd better hurry, 'cause the Strawberry Blizzard Special at the Dairy Queen only lasts till five.
- Come on, I'll drive.
- Oh, let's not drive.
Let's skip there.
Oh, my goodness, It's 2:00 in the morning.
- And I am still wide awake.
- Me too.
You know, before I met you two girls, I was never up this late.
Except, of course, during the Jerry Lewis Telethon.
- Of course.
- I was never a night person, either.
Until I blossomed into young womanhood and realized I was even more devastating by moonlight.
Of course.
I will never forget the night I made that discovery.
It was during the spring cotillion.
I was wearing a long white dress and my first push-up bra.
And Bobby Buck McAIlister and I were enjoying a glass of punch out on the veranda, when a beam of moonlight hit my cleavage.
Suddenly, the band began to play.
It was at that moment I realized my bosoms had the power to make music.
Didn't Bette Midler win a special Grammy for that?
Oh, girls.
Isn't it wonderful how we always have such a good time together?
- It's been that way right from the start.
- Please, Rose.
Don't you remember the day after we moved in when we went shopping together?
Walking by that sausage case back there really brought back a lot of memories.
Sausage opens a floodgate for many of us, Rose.
- What's this, Blanche?
- Smoked oysters.
Oh, come on.
Now, I know we said we'd go in on everything equally, but this is four dollars a can.
Well, we have to have these.
They're absolutely essential.
Well, if you ever have a date with a man who's a little sluggish a tin of these and a bottle of cold duck, you'll be prying him off the wall.
- Those are very nice cantaloupes.
- Why, thank you.
- This one's ripe.
- And how do you tell, Dorothy?
Well, you smell the tip of it.
It's an old Sicilian method my mother taught me.
Oh, Dorothy, dear.
The best way to tell if a melon is ripe is Southern.
You thump it.
Well, actually, roomies, I have the best method - the farm method.
- It works every time.
- And what might that be, Rose, dear?
No.
Mm-mm.
Better.
Yeah, I almost forgot.
We need a Globe and a Tattler and a Midnight Star and an Enquirer and I guess maybe one serious newsmagazine so we know what's going on in the world - one People.
Excuse me, you made a mistake.
Those peaches aren't 59 cents a pound: they're 89 cents.
Honesty is the best policy.
What are you trying to do, Rose?
Qualify for some kind of scout badge?
Well, I can't help it if I'm an honest person.
Obviously, something you don't know anything about.
- What are you talking about?
- Well, you bought pantyhose in petite.
Anybody can see you couldn't get those past your knees.
If you don't keep your voice down, I'm gonna hit you in the head with this loin of pork.
Oh, Blanche, come on!
$15.99?
Now, this is just too extravagant.
I'm not going in on this.
I don't even like loin of pork.
All right, then I'm not going in on this nightstick.
- This is a pepperoni.
- It's obnoxious.
Excuse me.
You made a mistake.
That Windex isn't on sale this week - the regular price is $1.99.
Rose, why don't you just save it for The Price is Right?
Excuse me for trying to be a good American.
Will you two please keep your voices down?
I have shopped and dated extensively throughout this market.
That does it, that does it!
I am shopping for myself.
Fine!
Blanche and I will do very nicely on our own.
Oh, no, I'm not shopping with you, Mary Poppins.
Fine!
All right, who put the Raisin Bran in the refrigerator?
- I did.
Do you have a problem with that?
- Yes, I do.
I have two problems with it.
First of all, there isn't room for it in there and second of all, it doesn't go in the refrigerator- it goes in the cabinet.
It does not go in the cabinet.
It stays fresher in the refrigerator.
No, it does not stay fresher in the refrigerator.
If it stayed fresher in the refrigerator, there would be a sign on it saying "refrigerate.
" Actually, you're both wrong.
It does not belong in a refrigerator.
It does not belong in a cabinet.
It belongs in a glass canister.
That way, it's not only visually appealing, but you can see if they cheated you out of raisins.
I thought everybody knew that.
You know, until I met you, Rose, I didn't know that people actually talk back to their Rice Krispies.
All right, I have had it!
Thanks to all this constant bickering, I now have a splitting headache.
Oh, girls, let's face facts.
The three of us just can't agree on anything.
I mean, it is obvious we were not meant to live together.
I hate to agree with you, but I think you're right.
I think so too.
In fact, I know so.
This is exactly what happened during the Great Herring War.
The Great Herring War?
Yes.
Between the Lindstroms and the Johanssons.
Oh, that Great Herring War!
The two families controlled the most fertile herring waters off the coast of Norway, so naturally, it seemed like it would be in their best interest to band together.
Oh, boy, was that a mistake.
You see, they couldn't agree on what to do with the herring.
Oh, well, that's understandable.
I mean, the possibilities are overwhelming.
Exactly.
The Johanssons wanted to pickle the herring and the Lindstroms wanted to train them for the circus.
Weren't they kind of hard to see, riding on the elephants?
Oh, not that kind of circus.
A herring circus.
Sort of like SeaWorld, only smaller.
Much, much smaller.
But bigger than a flea circus.
Tell me, Rose, um did they ever shoot a herring out of a cannon?
Only once.
But they shot him into a tree.
After that, no other herring would do it.
You're making this up!
I am not!
My grandfather told me that story.
Of course, he also used to call me by my sister's name.
And sometimes, he'd wear his underwear on the outside of his pants.
I guess he wasn't a very reliable source.
Ohh Ahh!
Oh, girls, girls, do you realize what just happened?
Well, I know I've been having a very good time, and there wasn't even a man in the room.
Do you think it was just a fluke, or do you think we could learn to like each other?
Well, I think it might take time, but I think it could be worth it.
- Let's give it a shot.
- Great!
- I'm game.
- OK.
Wait a minute.
What's that?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I know it's awful, but I have this incredible sweet tooth.
- What is it?
- Cheesecake.
- What kind?
- Chocolate.
Oh, I think this could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
I guess some things never change.
They sure don't.
We've almost finished the entire cheesecake.
Oh, what the hell.
It was a special occasion.
Yeah, and it sure took my mind off of Psycho.
Listen, these can wait till morning.
Let's go to bed.
OK.
Ma, that is not funny!
Are you kidding?
It's a riot!
I pulled it once on old man Peterson, after we had saw Psycho at the home.
They had said he would never walk again.
He walked.
Well, good night.
Sweet dreams!
Well I think I'll have just one more cup of tea.
Yeah, and we can finish the cheesecake.
Sounds good.
You know what would go so good on this cheesecake is those chocolate sprinkles.
- We finished those an hour ago.
- We could crush some Oreos on top.
We ran out of those two hours ago.
- How about some whip cream?
- Mm!
I think we still have a can.
I'll get it - it's in my bedroom.
Never mind, Blanche.
