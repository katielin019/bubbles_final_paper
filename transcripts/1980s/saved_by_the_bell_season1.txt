{START OF EPISODE 1}
When I wake up in the morning and the alarm gives out a warning I don't think I'll ever make it on time By the time I grab my books and I give myself a look I'm at the corner just in time to see the bus fly by It's all right 'Cause I'm saved by the bell If the teacher pops a test I know I'm in a mess And my dog ate all my homework last night Ridin' low on my chair, she won't know that I'm there If I can hand it in tomorrow it will be all right It's all right 'Cause I'm saved by the bell It's all right, 'cause I'm saved by the- It's all right, 'cause I'm saved by the- It's all right, 'cause I'm saved by the bell.
Hey everybody, attention please!
No, no, no.
I just got a telegram.
All: Ooh!
"Dance Party" has selected "The Max" for a televised dance contest with all those great kids from Bayside, next Saturday.
" And it's signed "Casey Kasem"!
- Let me see that.
- Cool, a dance contest!
How about you and I enter in the contest?
We could win it all.
Win?
With you?
Your feet need training wheels.
Winning, losing?
Dancing is supposed to be fun.
Well, it will be fun- if Kelly dances with me.
Well, gee, guys, I'd love to be partners with both of you.
Why don't you just go with the best dancer?
Hit it.
Wow, Slater, that was hot.
Are you kidding?
I moved better last summer when a bee flew in my shorts.
I'm waiting, "Preppie.
" Let's see what you got.
Move back, give him room.
Hot feet coming through!
Slater, I could beat you now with three toes tied behind my back.
You think you're a better dancer than me?
Go practice first, then we'll have a real dance-off.
Wow, a dancing duel.
How exciting!
Hey Lisa, my horoscope says we're destined to dance together.
My horoscope says, "Beware of dorks.
" Well, I'll protect you from them!
Hey Jessie, you want to be my partner for the dance contest?
Gee Danny, I'd love to.
Actually, no.
I don't believe in dance contests.
Then why don't we just skip the contest and kiss all night?
Bye, Danny.
Hmm skip the date and start with a goodnight kiss?
That Danny has good ideas.
Jessie: This cannot be right.
Tell me something is wrong with this scale before I hyperventilate.
The only thing wrong with that scale is the flake who's on it.
I have grown an inch taller since lunch.
I feel like a giant.
You are not a giant.
You're a bright, sensitive, popular girl.
Everyone "looks up" to you.
Thanks a lot.
I mean, what's going to happen to me if I keep growing?
Stand tall.
Be proud.
And practice your slam dunk.
Before I begin I have to make a very sad announcement.
Beethoven's alive?
Very amusing, Mr. Morris.
Ha-ha ha-ha.
No, unfortunately I have to conduct two music classes today, simultaneously.
Poor Mrs. Wickham slipped and got her head stuck in a tuba.
Well maybe they should get "Fat Tommy" to blow her out.
Good suggestion.
All right, people, today, we're going to play a piece by Johann Sebastian Bach.
A piece?
Why can't we play the whole thing?
All right people, instruments up!
One bar for nothing.
One, and two, and three, and Oh!
Thrilling!
Bach always gives me chills.
Keep playing my little wunderkind, I'll be right Bach- I mean, back.
Beautiful, beautiful!
I'm getting chills.
Are you feeling what I'm feeling?
Yes sir, it was the fish sticks at lunch.
You are what you eat, Powers.
All right, let me hear the horns!
No chewing gum in class, Mr. Morris.
All right, piano!
Elegantly played, Powers.
Let's hear strings and flute!
You're moving me, you're moving me.
Slater: All right, move it, Jessie!
Kelly: Whoo!
Shake it, girl!
Zack, why don't you show Kelly what a great dancer you are?
Not now, Screech.
Go ahead, Zack, I'm dying to see you dance.
Yeah, dazzle us, Preppie.
Wonderful.
This is why I went into teaching.
Wonderful, wonderful.
Now a little faster tempo.
Allegro con molto.
Poco, poco.
Yes.
Nice.
A little "brighter.
" Yes, nice.
There you are.
Lovely.
Huh?
Wait a minute.
People, it's a little too Cut it back.
That's a little too bright, people.
Where are you taking me?
Slow down, people!
It's too fast!
People, please!
Surcease!
Jessie, I'm in big trouble.
What'd you do?
Try to sell your parents' house again?
I can't dance.
I've been faking it for years.
If you can't dance, why'd you challenge Slater?
If Kelly and Slater enter that contest, they're going to win.
That means their names are going to be on the trophy.
Together touching.
- So?
- So, I've got to stop them.
I can't allow them to "name-neck.
" Ugh.
Jessie, you're a terrific dancer.
Come on, you've got to help me.
Sure I'll help.
Let's see a few of your best moves.
Come on.
So, what do you think?
I think you should go with Screech.
Come in.
Mr. Belding?
My name's Casey Kasem.
I'm here to talk about the dance party at The Max.
"Details coming up, right after I return.
" Just kidding.
Casey Kasem!
Wow.
I heard about the dance party.
Is there anything I can do to help?
I'm the "Big Bopper" around here.
Well actually, there is one thing.
Well, sit down and lay it upon me, "Big 'C".
At "Dance Party" we try to get the support of the local schools.
Say no more.
You want me to help you host the event.
That hadn't occurred to me.
I know.
You heard about me winning the 1963 "Chubby Checker Twist-Off.
" Here's a little taste.
Let's twist again, like we did last summer Yeah, let's twist again, like we did last year.
You want me to recreate that moment, right?
Well actually, I was hoping I could borrow a school banner.
A banner?
That's all?
That's all, "Bopper.
" Well okay, I'll present it to you on the show.
Gee, that'd be great.
But I can take it right now.
I don't have one right now.
I'll bring it to you.
Oh, Zack, when are you going to have the dance-off?
I need to know who my partner is.
Well, Slater will be humiliated the day after tomorrow.
Are you really that much better than him?
Every summer while the other kids were playing baseball, I was at dance camp.
Wow, I can't wait.
Why did I say that?
Zack: Whatever you're doing, don't.
My darling, be my partner, and this could be you.
So what do you say?
Pick you up, seven-ish?
Forget it, Screech.
She's already going with me.
Lisa, is that true?
Sorry Screech, he asked me this morning.
Come on.
It's all your fault.
I told you to let me lead.
- Whoo!
You're doing great.
- I am?
Hey, I am, aren't I?
Okay now, here's a new step I just invented.
- Awesome.
- Come on.
Do it with me.
Slater's going to freak out when he sees this.
Whoo!
Let's take five.
Yeah, let's cool down.
You're new at this.
Thanks.
You're a terrific dancer.
Yeah, well, I went to dance camp when I was a kid.
They actually have those?
I can't believe you're not entering the contest.
No big deal.
You're not into some strange religion, are you?
- No.
- Then what's the problem?
Zack, I don't want to talk about it, okay?
- Would you like to dance with me?
- I can't.
I'm bigger than you.
And I'm still growing at this very moment.
Too bad.
Maybe I should have asked 10 minutes ago.
Hey Jessie, let's dance.
I'm too big for you.
I'm too big for everyone.
- Jessie, is that you up there?
- Yes, it's me.
You don't want to dance with me, do you?
I can't.
Everybody will laugh at us.
Zack, I do have a problem- I'm too tall.
Well, I haven't noticed anyone measuring you lately.
That's because they can't reach me.
Zack, you don't know what it's like to be "the freak"- taller than all the boys- the jokes, the looks, the whispers.
- Stop looking up at me!
- Look at the bright side.
At least you're the first one to know when it rains.
Zack!
I'm sorry.
Come on, there's lots of guys taller than you.
Name one.
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar?
Come on, Screech, cheer up.
It can't be that bad.
It's no use trying to look stud-like anymore.
I think this time it's really over between me and Lisa.
Look, you can't give up.
I heard if Byron hadn't asked Lisa first, she'd have gone with you.
I know.
I started that rumor.
Well then maybe you should start looking for someone else.
I can't.
I've been crazy about her since kindergarten, when I glued my face to the back of her sweater.
So you've been "stuck on her" a long time, huh?
But what's the use?
The story never changes.
There's the beautiful princess, the dashing frog, and the wart he left behind.
Come on, Screech, I think you're being too hard on yourself.
Who is it?
- Can I come in?
- Zack?
This is the first time in 11 years you've come through the door.
Well, there's a special reason.
Here.
These are for you.
Oh, they're beautiful.
We have the same kind growing in our yard.
Not anymore.
Well, this is just to say thanks for helping me.
We're not finished yet.
We still have one more lesson.
Pretend I'm Kelly.
"Oh Zack.
Help me choose between you and Slater.
" Voil√†!
Lisa, what happened to you?
I kicked the TV and sprained my ankle.
Why?
Watching the new Revlon commercial- they discontinued my nail polish.
That was a dumb thing to do.
Where were you "Miss Pretty Pants" when I needed that advice?
Lisa, this is terrible.
I feel awful.
Don't worry about it, Byron.
I'll be okay.
Yeah, but can you dance on that ankle?
Well, the doctor said there's a chance.
"A chance"?
Well, I can't take that chance.
I really want to win this contest.
Byron, what are you saying?
I'm going to have to go with my back-up, Didi Garrison.
How could you do that to me?
Hey, let's "pants" him.
Better start running now, punk, or there's going to be a "full moon.
" Yeah, and don't show your face around here again!
Hold me back, Slater!
Hold me back!
No one hurts my woman!
He's a fool, Lisa.
You're hot no matter what.
You're strange, but thanks, Screech.
If you like strange, I'm your man.
- Well guys, it's the big moment.
- What?
Zack, dance for me and help me choose between you and Slater.
Kelly, do yourself a favor, go with Slater.
- Zack, what are you saying?
- Yeah, what are you up to, Preppie?
Well, nothing.
I've decided to go with Jessie.
Jessie?
If that's what you really want, Zack.
Come on, Slater.
Let's go practice.
- Will you go with me?
- I'd love to be your partner.
Didn't your mother ever tell you not to slouch?
You're much prettier when you stand up straight.
- Thanks.
- Oh, and one other thing- don't forget your high heels.
You might need them.
Can I have your attention, please?
It's now my pleasure to introduce the star of "Dance Party.
" Let's give him a- "big hand.
" The golden voice from the Golden State Casey Kasem!
Max, thank you.
And thank you for letting us use this great hangout for our dance contest this week.
Now, is everybody ready?
You know, through the years, I've been to a lot of schools.
I've met a lot of principals, but I have never met a principal who is so caring, so involved, and so hip, as your own "Big Bopper" Belding.
Thank you, "Caseman.
" - Now can I have the banner?
- Of course.
One minute, everybody.
Stand by and enjoy yourselves.
- I could twist and sing.
- Let go of the microphone.
And now, the big moment- the announcement of our three finalists who will all dance for you one more time, and then we'll pick the big winner with your applause.
- Ready with the applause meter?
- Ready, Casey.
Our first finalists, the exciting "Spandex Twins" Kelly Kapowski and AC Slater.
All right, very good.
Now for finalists number two, the "Powerhouse Preppies" welcome Zack Morris and Jessie Spano.
All right, now for our final couple, with a new dance they've invented called "The Sprain" Screech Powers and Lisa Turtle.
Bring 'em on.
Hey, there is no doubt about it.
We have a winner.
It is Screech and Lisa!
All right.
Well, that's a "good night" from us here at "Dance Party" everybody.
Till next time, this is Casey Kasem saying, "Keep your feet on the ground and keep reaching for the stars.
" Come on, everybody, let's do- "The Sprain"!
Boy: Work, Casey!
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
When I wake up in the morning and the alarm gives out a warning I don't think I'll ever make it on time By the time I grab my books and I give myself a look I'm at the corner just in time to see the bus fly by It's all right 'Cause I'm saved by the bell If the teacher pops a test I know I'm in a mess And my dog ate all my homework last night Ridin' low on my chair, she won't know that I'm there If I can hand it in tomorrow it will be all right It's all right 'Cause I'm saved by the bell It's all right, 'cause I'm saved by the- It's all right, 'cause I'm saved by the- It's all right, 'cause I'm saved by the bell.
We just got report cards.
Jessie got all "A's" her parents bought her flowers.
Kelly got "B's" her parents bought her an ice cream.
I haven't figured out what to buy my parents yet.
But Lisa made honor roll, and you should see what her father gave her.
Where's Lisa?
I can't wait to see her new outfit.
Me too.
She's my reason for being.
I cannot believe her father gave her his credit card to go to the mall.
I know.
It's like letting a vampire loose in a blood bank.
Watch it, "Dimples.
" That's my fox you're talking about.
Screech, she's not your fox.
Why don't you just find another chick?
Whoa!
May I remind you both that we are girls?
We are not "foxes," not "chicks," nor any other cute little animal you boys like.
- Do you understand?
- Sure, "Kitten.
" Food's here.
Compliments of my new magic serving cart.
Zack: So where's the magic, Max?
Oh, it's voil√†!
How do you like it?
I love it, but didn't your father say to just buy something nice?
I couldn't help myself.
I caught such great sales.
All my clothes were half-off.
"Half-off"?
I can't take this tension.
Lisa, I think you better total up everything you bought right now.
Really?
I have a calculator on my watch.
You can use it if you hold my wrist.
Screech, heel.
- Where are the receipts?
- Here.
$62 for the top, $126 for the jacket and shorts, and $198 for the boots, purse and "Maneater" perfume?
- Come on, what's the total?
- $386.
$386?
You think I went overboard?
- Like the crew of the Titanic.
- This is serious.
Lisa, when your father finds out, you are going to get in trouble.
Oh come on.
I'm "Daddy's little girl.
" If you want to live to be "Daddy's big girl, " take the stuff back.
Lisa, I think you should keep one thing and return the rest.
Maybe you're right.
I have to go back to the mall anyway.
They're having a big shoe sale.
I got here as soon as I could.
What's going on?
Lisa's running away- the store wouldn't let her return her clothes.
Oh.
Lisa, running away isn't the answer.
Do what I do when I do something wrong.
- What's that?
- Enjoy it, then deny it.
Lisa, when you do something wrong, you should admit it.
What do you do, Kelly?
Well, gee.
I can't remember doing anything wrong.
Oh, shut up!
I'm sorry.
I'm just upset.
Lisa, no matter what I've done, I've always been direct and honest with my parents.
I'm with Jessie.
The truth is easiest, and it works.
But I can't tell my father.
Then why don't you tell your mother and pay her to keep quiet?
- Pay her with what?
- Put it on the card.
Why stop now?
Lisa, why can't you tell your father?
Because I don't know how he'll react.
Come in.
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi, Daddy.
What did you want to talk to me about?
Daddy, I don't know what to do.
I've made a big mistake.
I'm sure it's not that bad, Princess.
Tell your father.
He knows best.
Okay.
Daddy, I've run up a $400 bill on your credit card.
You what?
I'm sorry.
Who's the worst daughter of all?
Lisa- Lisa- Lisa!
You are a father's worst nightmare.
What's happened to me?
I'm not Daddy's little girl anymore.
He's going to kill me.
I know it.
Don't panic.
All you have to do is pay your father back.
Yeah, but where am I going to get the money?
Ask for a $400 advance on your allowance.
Why don't you try to earn the money?
Earn money?
Moi?
This sounds like a job for "Zackman.
" Do you really think we're going to make a lot of money today?
We're going to be raking it in all day.
- Starting now.
- How?
Lisa, sit down, look pretty and trust me.
Hey guys come on, crowd around, crowd around.
Okay, settle down.
- Good morning, class.
- Students: Good morning.
Resume where we left off yesterday.
You all know the chapter.
You mean "Reproduction in the Animal Kingdom"?
Well, I prefer to call it, "Monkey Business in the Jungle.
" I read the chapter last night, but I'm still not clear who does what to whom and how.
Yeah, and how come birds aren't attracted to horses?
Oh, but they are.
Unfortunately there just isn't enough room in the nest.
Today's topic is, "The Pond: Nature's Hot Tub.
" Could you write on the board again, your list - of "Pond Playmates of the Month"?
- All right, we'll start with the Beatles, then throw in some Rolling Stones.
Teacher: Does anyone know the sound the male frog makes to attract the female?
No, that's the little boy porcupine getting too close to his mate.
The male frog goes Ribbit- ribbit- ribbit.
That's merely his way of saying, "Your pad or mine"?
Insect love on the other hand, can be very, very dangerous.
An unwelcome suitor is often driven off by terrifying threats.
Get away, creeps!
Oh no.
Much worse than that.
Like- Try it, try it.
Good, very good.
Excellent.
Wonderful.
Wonderful.
You really have it.
Good morning, students.
This is your principal, Mr. Belding.
Thank you.
I want to remind you, our charity drive will continue all week.
So please put all clothing and canned goods in the gym, and not on top of my car, no matter what Zack Morris says.
It's also time for our annual Earthquake Drill.
Yes, when that siren sounds, get down, 'cause there'll be- A whole lot of shakin' goin' on.
All right, everybody, climb under your tables, like burrowing badgers.
Screech: Lisa!
How could you do this to me?
Hey Lisa, I thought you wanted to kiss your debt goodbye.
Not with my lips.
I feel so- so cheap.
Lisa, you're not cheap.
You made $36.
So I just have to press this button to open them?
That's all.
I wired everything.
Are you sure I have nothing to worry about?
You might lose your hair when you're older.
I mean now.
How about now, you yo-yo?
You're too young to lose it now, dipstick!
Zack, do we really have to do this?
Lisa, we only have two-and-a-half days left.
If you want to raise money, you'll have to sell your clothes.
All right, you guys know what to do.
Don't worry about it, "Preppie.
" We'll take care of Belding.
All right everybody, the "Lisa Special Sale" is about to begin.
Okay, what am I bid for this lovely lingerie?
Worn by Lisa while dreaming of Screech.
- My entire life savings!
- Sold!
It's only two dollars.
Two dollars?
That cost 20!
It will lie next to me every night in my bed.
I thought you slept with your dog.
He won't mind.
Okay, how much am I bid for these cowboy boots?
Almost brand new.
Worn only once by Lisa while she was watching a rodeo on TV.
- Six dollars.
- Sold!
How much am I bid for the left one?
- Four dollars.
- You got it!
That's what I call a "matching pair.
" Okay, how much am I bid for this wig?
Worn by Lisa during her "Tina Turner" phase.
Four dollars!
Sold to Rocco.
No questions asked.
Hey, Belding is coming.
Closing them!
- Hi, Mr. Belding.
- Hello, Morris.
He's on to us, Zack.
I know it, we're dead!
- Hi, Screech.
- Hello, goodbye.
Let's do lunch.
Hmm.
Let the sale resume!
Belding!
He's ba-ack!
Closing them!
Are you hiding something, Zachary?
- Me?
- Uh-huh.
Mr. Belding, sir.
I need your opinion.
I was wondering, what do you think of this?
It's all right, I guess.
Is it for your girlfriend?
No, sir.
It's for me.
I'd like to wear it to school tomorrow.
Come into my office, young lady- Slater.
Now.
You think moving from school to school has caused an identity crisis?
I'm not sure who I am anymore, sir.
All I know is that I'm a size six.
I would have guessed a 12.
I'm confused, sir.
You know, maybe I'm trying too hard to get girls to like me.
Hey, now I can identify with that.
This may come as a surprise to you, but when I was your age, I wasn't- well, you know- the hunk I am now.
I can't believe this, sir.
No, I thought you were "stud city.
" Everybody thinks that.
No, I never had a date until I was in the Army.
And even she was with the enemy.
Tell me more.
In high school, I was such a geek.
I had to go to the prom with my own sister.
I was so embarrassed.
Let it out, big guy.
Lean on me.
Attention shoppers, for two minutes only, "The Lisa Beach Collection," what the well-dressed teenager will be wearing this summer.
Screech, hit it.
And now for the beautiful and enchanting Kelly, "Goddess of the Sand.
" Oh my gosh, she's in a bathing suit!
The bidding is open.
The bidding is closed.
Sold to me for $12.
Thank you, Kelly.
Go get dressed.
Stay away from these animals.
After the war, I was dateless again.
That Viet Cong girl dumped me.
But then I went to college and met the future Mrs. Belding.
See, she was on the swim team, and I was a towel boy.
I tripped, hit my head, fell into the water- she saved my life.
Wow, that's a beautiful story, sir.
I'll never forget her first words to me, "Don't swallow your tongue.
" Yes?
Mr. Belding, maintenance wants you in the boys' bathroom.
Someone flushed Mr. Fetterman's toupee.
I'll be right there.
Wait!
What's going on here?
Oh, we're just standing around doing macho guy stuff next to a bunch of women's clothes.
Who's are these, anyway?
Uh Lisa's sir.
I helped her bring them to school today.
Yeah, Lisa needs to get rid of them.
This is the most generous act I've ever witnessed at this school.
Imagine one person donating all this to our clothing drive.
- But, sir!
- And you of all people helping her.
- I'm getting chills, brother.
- I'm getting sweats.
You know what?
Lisa has done enough.
Let's all take this to the gym for her, huh?
We only made $53 selling Lisa's clothes, so she had to do the most humiliating, insulting, degrading thing possible for her- get a job!
How's she doing?
Let me put it another way- if Lisa were a car, she'd be recalled.
I'm sorry, Max!
That's okay, it's only the third tray you've dropped.
Don't worry about it.
See?
I had the kitchen Velcro your orders.
Thanks.
So, did you get more tips?
Yeah, I got a tip.
Alan Seltzer told me to get another job.
Waitress, can I have a glass of water?
Get it yourself!
Lisa, you're a waitress.
You have to wait on people.
Zack, he just wants to soak his retainer.
Waitress!
How can I work with all these people bothering me?
So what's the total?
Well, so far Lisa's earned $3.10 in tips.
Kelly: Who gave you the 10?
Everybody gave me 10.
Waitress!
- What is it?
- Would you bring me a hamburger?
I already brought you 10.
I want to give you business.
I like you.
Thank you.
Waitress!
Where's my Ovaltine?
Miss, this isn't what I ordered.
You were supposed to toast my buns.
You want toasted buns?
Go sit on a microwave!
That's it!
I've had it!
Hey, hey, what's wrong?
I'll never make any money at this rate.
Well then, you've got to move faster.
Look, the more people you wait on, the more tips you get, right?
Come on Lisa.
I'll show you.
I used to be a busboy in Bolivia.
Hey, I'm not done.
Yes you are.
Right, I forgot.
Hey, what are you doing?
- Hey, it's fast food.
- Here's your check.
Hey, come on you guys.
Come on, move it.
$37 in tips in three hours?
Whoo!
I can't believe it!
Lisa, that's great.
You only need about 230 more.
We're a great team.
You know, we might make it after all.
Yeah, maybe.
I mean if I keep working, and Zack sells more of my clothes.
Uh Lisa?
Can we talk?
Over there?
Yeah, sure.
Lisa, all your clothes are gone.
- Gone?
That's great!
- Not really.
Belding thought you brought them in for the charity drive.
He was so touched by your donation, I couldn't tell him the truth.
I'm a fool, Zack.
No, I am.
Look, I'm sorry, Lisa.
I'll tell Belding it was my fault and get your stuff back.
No, Zack.
I want to make that donation.
It's about time I start thinking of someone besides myself.
And I'm going to tell my father the truth.
Now Lisa, don't panic.
Zack, if my father finds out what I've done before I tell him, he's going to be really hurt.
Then maybe you'd better tell your father.
I see this is hurting you, too.
I want to thank you for all you've done.
I'm really grateful for everything you tried to do.
But I've got to stand on my own two feet now.
And it's not going to be easy with all my shoes gone.
Come in.
You wanted to talk to me, Princess?
I'm not a princess, I'm not a nice person, I'm pond scum!
What are you talking about?
Remember when you gave me your credit card to buy something nice?
I bought 10 nice somethings.
Are you saying you charged too much on my credit card?
$386 too much.
I'd say that's too much.
Yes.
I'm sorry, Daddy.
We all make mistakes, sweetheart.
I'm sure you've learned your lesson.
Now, let's go to The Sizzler.
"The Sizzler"?
After all I've been through?
Daddy, I was kissed by nerds!
And I sold all my clothes!
And I got a job- as a waitress!
My daughter waited on tables?
Yeah, here's $153.
That's what I've made so far.
It sounds like you've been through a lot.
Daddy, punish me.
Get it over with.
I just want to be treated like any normal, beautiful girl.
I've got a better idea.
You're going to keep that job until you pay me back every cent.
Come in.
Excuse me, Dr. Turtle.
We came by to give this to Lisa.
- What is it?
- $83.
We all chipped in.
Screech even sold his body to science.
Yeah, they gave him $20 to take it back.
You have some loyal friends.
You are a very lucky girl.
Thanks, you guys, you're great.
But I can't take this.
I've got to earn back the money myself, or he'll ship me to a foreign country.
It'll never happen.
No foreign country could afford her.
The moral of the story, gang?
Well, it's simple: "The Lisa Card"- don't leave home with it.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
When I wake up in the morning and the alarm gives out a warning I don't think I'll ever make it on time By the time I grab my books and I give myself a look I'm at the corner just in time to see the bus fly by It's all right 'Cause I'm saved by the bell If the teacher pops a test I know I'm in a mess And my dog ate all my homework last night Ridin' low on my chair, she won't know that I'm there If I can hand it in tomorrow it will be all right It's all right 'Cause I'm saved by the bell It's all right, 'cause I'm saved by the- It's all right, 'cause I'm saved by the- It's all right, 'cause I'm saved by the bell.
The three worst things that can happen to a kid, are measles, mumps, and midterms.
I'd rather study measles and mumps.
Our most dreaded midterm is given by a man, whose very name strikes fear in the heart of every student.
Terrible Testaverde!
Zack Morris, don't mention that man's name.
Oh, you mean Zack, I'm a nervous wreck.
When I'm nervous I eat.
Have a doughnut.
No, I need them.
She's a wreck?
My streak is in danger.
I have had straight "A's" ever since "Sesame Street.
" You mean you were a "Big Bird-brain"?
Hey, everyone deals with pressure in his own way.
All right, Morris.
Hey, you ready for today's bet?
You've lost three in a row.
I'll get you this time, Slater.
How about my sunglasses against your Swiss Army knife?
Okay, the game's the same.
Here's your ammo.
- I found us a new target.
- Prepare to lose.
- Ready?
- Uh-huh.
Go!
- Screech?
- Hi, Zack.
Yes, I win again.
Here's your five bucks, Screech.
- Good job.
- Thanks, Slater.
Why were you the target?
I couldn't throw at a friend, you pinhead.
He's got your sunglasses, I've got five bucks, and you've got diddly.
Sounds you're the "pinhead," pinhead.
Hey, you can't just win and walk.
Let's make a real bet, with real stakes.
Hey well, you know Zack, I could use your ham radio.
There's that gymnast I left behind in Germany.
She really flipped over me.
Enough.
It's a bet.
It's my radio against your bomber jacket.
You're on.
I bet you that the next person to come down those stairs will be Kelly Kapowski.
You're going to lose this one.
I'm an expert on Kelly's schedule, and right now she's walking into the gym for volleyball practice and she wouldn't miss practice for the world.
Hi, guys.
Anybody seen my sneakers?
I can't find them anywhere.
Oh- you mean these?
You must have left them in my locker by mistake.
But why would?
Oh, never mind.
I'm late for practice.
- That's not fair.
- No, but it's smart.
You can deliver my radio tomorrow morning.
You know, I really find him lacking as a person.
and so my friends, I'm pulling the plug on my radio.
I have to go into hiding again.
Now this is Elvis Presley signing off.
"Don't be cruel.
" - Okay, Screech!
Disconnect!
- Okay!
Hurry up!
It sounds like it's going to pour out there!
I'll be done in a- Argh!
Screech!
Are you okay?
Screech!
Answer me!
Screech-!
Screech!
Are you alive?
What's for dinner, Mom?
Look, you better sit down.
I think you were hit by lightning.
Fish would be fine.
Can we have pudding for dessert?
Where are you going, Screech?
Home to study for Testaverde's midterm.
- Answer the phone.
- Screech, the phone's not- - So how do you feel?
- Oh, better than usual.
Zack, I think we better get out of here right now.
Sorry, kid.
It slipped.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm all right.
Thanks to him.
Hey, Screech.
How'd you know that light was going to fall?
I'm not sure.
Ever since that lighting hit me last night, I've been getting these pictures in my head.
- What kind of pictures?
- All kinds.
Real clear ones.
Right now, I'm getting a tennis racket.
A tennis racket?
What do you mean, a tennis rack- Tell me, buddy.
What other pictures do you see?
I see nerds.
- It's my pocket protector.
- No, it's mine.
You give it back or I'll tell.
This is the most incredible thing that's ever happened!
More incredible than the "Brady Bunch" reunion?
Yes!
You've been given a gift- the power to see the future.
I knew you were going to say that.
As your best friend, I've got warn you, there are people out there who'd take advantage of you.
For your sake, I think we should keep this gift between you and me.
- Agreed?
- Thanks for protecting me, Zack.
I've got the geek that laid the golden egg.
I knew you were going to say that, too.
Your American History midterm will be Thursday at 10:00 AM.
It will consist of three essay questions.
I thought we'd spend this last session before the exam reviewing the material from which those questions will be drawn.
As usual, we have a lot to cover.
So if you pay careful attention, you'll have nothing to worry about.
Everybody ready?
We'll begin with British actions between 1763 and 1775 that led to discontent among the Colonists- the first was the Proclamation of 1763 forbidding settlement in all lands west of the Appalachians followed by the Quartering Act of 1765 forcing Colonists to house and feed British troops, followed by the Stamp Act in 1765 ordering Colonists to buy stamps from the British, followed by more taxes in 1767 on glass, paint, paper and tea leading to colonists rioting throwing snowballs at soldiers shouting, "Lobster"!
"Bloody-back"!
"Coward"!
Leading to the Boston Massacre leaving three Colonists lying dead.
That brings us to 1773 and the Tea Act saying only the British could bring tea into the Colonies and only the British East India Company could sell it, leading to Sons of Liberty dressing like what used to be called Indians now known as Native Americans stealing aboard a British ship dumping cargo into Boston Harbor in an event known as the "Boston Tea Party," without sugar, lemon or cream.
Americans won the Battle of King's Mountain and the Battle of Cowpens, forcing Cornwallis to march north to Virginia to be met by Patriots in North Carolina.
He suffered losses and retreated to Yorktown, leading to Washington's fake attack on New York followed by a swift move to block Cornwallis' escape by land, forcing Cornwallis to surrender at Yorktown on October 19th 1781 while the British band played "The World Turned Upside Down" and the American band played "Yankee Doodle"!
Any questions?
Good luck.
See you Thursday.
I cannot run track today.
I have so much food in me, you could put a quarter in my mouth and a bag of Doritos would come popping out.
Lisa, you have got to stop doing this to yourself.
That's easy for you to say.
Nothing bothers you.
Oh yeah?
Lots of things bother me.
I just don't let them drive me bananas.
You have one?
Lisa, come on.
If you keep obsessing about your grades you know what you're going to end up like?
You know, you guys, I just remembered- there was one time that I did not get an "A".
I was in the fourth grade.
Mr. Simmons had a nervous breakdown and gave the class "L's" and "Q's.
" Why is getting an "A" so important to you?
It's not important- all right it is.
I know it shouldn't be but I can't help myself.
It's my whole identity.
- What are you talking about?
- Will you stop hollering at me?
Look, everyone's got to be something, right?
She's the fashionable one.
You're the popular one.
Who am I?
The wacko one.
You know Kelly, you remind me a lot of my cousin Denise.
She never worried.
She was always on honor roll.
- Until she had Testaverde.
- What happened to her?
She flunked history, and had to go to summer school which was also taught by Testaverde.
She got left back, dropped out, today she teaches English to foreign parrots.
You see?
She makes good sense.
You guys might be right.
I think we should cut gym and hit the books.
This test is gonna be no piece of cake.
Cake?
Who has cake?
Okay Screech.
Slater will be here in a minute to pick this up.
Actually, 71/2 seconds.
Now you remember all the signals we rehearsed?
- Yep.
- Okay.
All right, Morris.
It's time to pay the piper.
Hey, I see you got my radio.
I got it.
But what's the rush?
How about another bet?
You never learn, do you, sucker?
What are you going to lose now, your TV set?
I don't know.
For some reason I kind of feel lucky today.
How about my TV and stereo for this radio and your jacket?
You're on, "Preppie.
" This is Hans.
Ver ist you, Elvis?
What'd you say?
Nein- I mean, nothing.
So call it.
What's the bet?
Okay, the bet is who's coming down those steps next.
- You're on.
- I guess a blonde in tight jeans.
And I say a band member.
Very good, Zack.
How'd you do that?
Screech, your mother told me about lightning hitting you.
I just want to make sure you're doing all right.
- Tell me- - 8:30 last night.
When exactly were you struck by lightning?
- 8:30?
- Yeah.
- Are there any - One.
side-effects?
Did you say one?
Yeah, but it's a secret.
I'm not supposed to tell anyone - I can see the future.
- See the future?
- Screech, that's- - Preposterous?
- Right.
- Can she come in?
Mr. Wilson wants to know if you can move your lunch to 1:00.
He can't, he has a dentist appointment.
Make it Tuesday.
Now where was I?
You were about to say no one has the power to see the future.
Right!
Screech, no one has the power to see the future.
- Oops!
I'll pick them up.
- Pick what up?
Uh, Screech, I'm just curious.
My mother-in-law is staying with us indefinitely.
Now, by any chance can you tell me-?
- She'll be gone by Tuesday.
- All right!
Saturday, the track opens at noon and the first race is at 1:00?
Okay, thanks.
Bye.
Here put this in my gym bag.
Come on, Screech.
I can't wait forever.
Tell me now.
Tell you what?
The three questions on Testaverde's midterm.
Discuss the four steps taken by the first Continental Congress; the three parts of the Declaration of Independence; and the Battle of Saratoga as the turning point of the war.
That's my man!
Now for the kill!
Okay, Slater, it's the bet of the year: the loser has to be a slave for a week, and do anything the winner wants.
Up to it?
What are we betting on?
I bet you that I'm going to ace Testaverde's midterm tomorrow.
Zack, Testaverde couldn't ace Testaverde's midterm.
We got a bet, Preppie.
Excuse me, but I got to go home and start making a slave list.
- You wish, Slater.
- Hey, starting tomorrow, it's going to be "Master Slater.
" Zack, how can you be so confident?
Why not?
Testaverde told us what to review.
- But he talks so fast.
- Oh really?
I didn't notice.
It's too bad you don't want to study with me, but hey, failing miserably is no disgrace.
Well, maybe I've changed my mind.
- 7:30, my house?
- Okay.
Zack, can you turn on another light?
I can hardly see the book.
And that music is so mellow, it's distracting.
Hey Kelly, I read that "tension is the enemy of learning.
" - Really?
- Sure.
Try this: sit back, close your eyes, and relax your body.
- Okay, let's get back to- - You're not relaxed enough!
Look, I suggest some stress-releasing activity.
Like what?
Come on.
Zack we're preparing for a midterm, not a prom.
Kelly, relax.
You think I want to be Slater's slave?
We're going to ace this midterm.
Trust me.
Okay.
Are you sure?
Jessie: That's what I want to know.
What are you doing here?
Zack, you said you knew all the questions.
I couldn't keep it from my best friends.
Zack!
You're an angel.
I've lost two pounds since I heard the news.
Where's the lightning when you really need it?
Zack, how can you be so sure what's on Testaverde's midterm?
Hey, come on.
I can just see it.
Like Richard Dreyfuss in "Close Encounters.
" Oh, you mean some weird-looking creature told you?
Kind of.
You do believe him, don't you, Jessie?
Maybe I do.
Because I know Zack, and he wouldn't lie to Kelly.
Would you, Zack?
- No I wouldn't.
- Because if Kelly found out this was an excuse to get her alone with you, she'd kill you, wouldn't you, Kelly?
- Yes I would!
- Hey, everyone- take it easy.
Just study the First Continental Congress, the Declaration of Independence, and the Battle of Saratoga, okay?
- What about everything else?
- Don't waste your time.
Now if you'll leave me alone, I have to prepare to get my "A".
- Zack!
We've got to talk.
- Screech, I'm studying.
That's just it.
Now I see different questions on Testaverde's midterm.
What do you mean?
Now I see the Committees of Correspondence and the Battle of Trenton.
No wait, it's "The Battle of The Network Stars.
" I see Patrick Henry- no it's Patrick Swayze- dirty dancing across the Delaware with Martha Washington.
I see Paul Revere on a bus- Zack, did you know that Lincoln freed the Japanese?
I think I've lost it.
Come on, don't jump to conclusions.
Hey, you knew I was going to say that, didn't you?
All right, call it in the air.
Heads!
Two out of three.
Tails!
I'm history unless I come up with a plan.
Zack, we could get in real trouble for this.
Screech, just flush the toilets.
It's ringing.
Ready with the buckets!
Hello, Mr. Testaverde?
Well, this is Mr. Belding.
What?
What?
You can hardly hear me?
Well, that's because of all the chaos around here.
The pipes broke this morning and we're up to our knees in water!
I can't stop the water, Joe!
The water's rising, Tom.
Help!
Yes we're postponing all midterms until we've got this mess under control.
So don't bother coming in today, all right?
All right!
Okay, cut out the noise.
Whew!
Zack, are you sure this is going to work?
Screech, in confusion, there's victory.
Now, Belding should be entering his office just about now.
He sits down, hears the phone ring, and- Hello, Mr. Belding?
This is Mr. Testaverde.
What's wrong with me?
You can hear what's wrong with me.
Laryngitis, a horrible cough and postnasal drip!
That was the doorbell.
The delivery boy's here with my medicine.
I'm too sick to come in.
If I give you my three questions, will you administer it for me?
Thanks.
Here's the questions Thanks for helping me, Zack.
I feel so good about this test.
Me too.
I hope.
Zack, if you're wrong, I'm going to need a jumbo barf bag.
A list of slave chores, Morris.
And that's just for the first day.
Housebreak your Doberman?
If I don't get an "A" on this test, I will train my dog to think you're a tree, okay?
Morning, class.
- What's he doing here?
- I have no idea.
Mr. Testaverde's ill, so I'm going to administer his midterm.
Now the exam consists of three essay questions: I'll read them aloud, so listen carefully and copy them down.
Number one: Discuss the four steps taken by the Continental Congress.
Number two: Discuss the three parts of the Declaration of Independence.
Number three: Discuss the Battle of Saratoga as the turning point in the war.
Good luck, everyone.
- You're terrific, Zack.
- Hey, I was right all along.
Richard!
Belding: George, what are you doing here?
My loyalty to school wouldn't let me stay home in time of crisis.
Besides, plumbing's my hobby.
Where's the flood?
What flood?
And what happened to your laryngitis?
Laryngitis?
I don't have laryngitis.
What's going on here?
Well, I'm giving your midterm.
Those are not the questions to my midterm.
These are the questions you called me with.
- You called me!
- George, you called me.
- Richard you called me.
- No, George.
You called me.
Wait a minute- you called me George.
You always call me George.
The person who phoned me called me "Mr. Testaverde.
" And the person who phoned me called me "Mr. Belding.
" But what kind of devious creature would make two fake phone calls?
Zack can't come to the phone right now.
He's on the way to pick up his season tickets to detention.
If you'd like to leave a message, please wait for the beep.
Beep.
Now for the real questions.
Number one: List and discuss the Intolerable Acts of 1774.
Number two: Describe four steps taken by the Second Continental Congress.
Number three: Discuss two strengths and three weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation.
Hey all right!
He posted the grades.
- "C-".
- Not bad.
Congratulations.
I am a forgiving person, Zack.
But this is going to take a very long time.
A "D+"?
I'm going to be sick.
Lisa, what is that funny-looking letter next to my name?
It's a "Q," Jessie.
No, really.
I can take it.
Whatever I got, I deserved.
For the first time in my life I took the easy way out.
I'm prepared to face the consequences.
It's a "B," Jessie.
Oh, gosh, we better take her to the nurse.
- Zack, I got an "A"!
- Screech, how'd you do that?
I was seeing so many different pictures, I just stayed up all night and went over everything.
Oh, you cheated- you studied.
And now we come to Zack Morris: "F-", for scamming.
Well, Zack, I'd say you lost the bet there, "slave.
" You can give me back my jacket, use your cellular phone to order me a pizza, and then start get to work on this list.
Yes, hello.
I'd like to order a large pizza with mushrooms, anchovies and the hottest peppers you can find.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
When I wake up in the morning and the alarm gives out a warning I don't think I'll ever make it on time By the time I grab my books and I give myself a look I'm at the corner just in time to see the bus fly by It's all right 'Cause I'm saved by the bell If the teacher pops a test I know I'm in a mess And my dog ate all my homework last night Ridin' low on my chair, she won't know that I'm there If I can hand it in tomorrow it will be all right It's all right 'Cause I'm saved by the bell It's all right, 'cause I'm saved by the- It's all right, 'cause I'm saved by the- It's all right, 'cause I'm saved by the bell.
- Excuse me?
- Please, please, do not apologize for existing.
How may I serve you?
Isn't this Zack Morris' locker?
That is true.
While I am in your country, we are sharing.
Do you know where Zack is?
Yes I do.
His body went that way, but his soul is in the gymnasium Thank you!
Things are not always as they seem.
It's me, Zack!
Why the disguise?
Lots of girls want to ask me to the dance, but I don't want to say yes or no until I know if Kelly's going to ask me.
Simple.
- Kelly.
- Hi, Zack.
So Kell, big dance Friday night, huh?
I haven't asked anyone yet, Zack.
Really?
Well I just want you to know I'm keeping my calendar clear, if you know what I mean.
I know what you mean- you want me to ask you.
- You could do worse.
- She could do better.
A lot better.
You don't think she'd consider going out with you?
Only if she wants to have a great time.
- In your dreams, Slater.
- In your face, "Preppie.
" You're looking at her date.
Hmm, tough decision.
So many boys, so little time.
If I were you, Morris, I'd find someone else.
Hey Zack!
"Zackie"!
Go get her, Zackie!
Hey, what's the rush, "button nose"?
Slater, help me, come on.
Give me a second.
All right.
Look, I've got nothing against Rhonda Robistelli.
But I do have this policy against dating anyone who holds the school shot-put record.
All right, I kept my part of the bargain.
Here's your "Seventeen," "Glamour," and "Cosmo.
" What's this?
How'd the "Sports lllustrated Swimsuit Issue" get in here?
I have my needs too.
Never mind.
Who's Kelly going to take to the dance?
Well, according to my research, Gina, Alex, and Rebecca think Kelly's asking Slater.
What do they know?
Connie, Didi and Raylene think she's leaning to you.
Smart girls.
Sue Ann thinks Kelly's going to ask Rodney Carter if his face clears up.
Well, remind me to buy Rodney a candy bar.
Is that it Lisa?
Not all of it.
I seem to be losing my memory.
All right, I'll do your history homework.
From you that's not a gift, that's a threat.
Come on.
You had to find out more than that.
Maybe.
All right, all right.
I'll sweeten up the deal.
I'll give you my tickets to the Bon Jovi concert.
Bon Jovi?
You got it!
- Okay, now what's the scoop?
- Kelly is definitely taking you - Thanks, Lisa.
- or Slater.
- That's it?
- Yeah.
Well Bon Jovi, bon voyage.
So Slater, you got a date for the dance yet?
Hey, I've been turning them down left and right.
Yeah, me too.
I turned down six girls.
That's nothing.
I've turned down seven and a teacher.
You guys are so disgusting.
If either of you had an ounce of integrity, you'd go with the first girl that asked you.
And miss the excitement of the hunt?
Please, I'm eating here.
Hi.
Kelly says she can make it to your slumber party tomorrow night.
- Great.
- Hey, I'll be there with my nightie, pimple cream and curlers.
- No way, Jos√©.
- Hey, it was worth a shot.
Hey, isn't a slumber party where you girls spill your guts about everything?
- Why?
- I'm sure Kelly will say who she's going to take to the dance, then you can tell us.
Not if Kelly doesn't want us too.
That would be invading someone's privacy, Zack.
I could live with that.
Why couldn't you live with a foreign family?
Hey Zack, a young lady asked me to give this to you.
Oooh!
Oh, I almost forgot, there's a message too- "Dear Zack, my heart jumps for you.
" - She loves you, kid.
- Who?
Hey, Zackie!
We've got to talk, hunk of mine.
That boy has got one cute behind.
Zack are you sure we should be bugging Jessie's bedroom?
We could get arrested, thrown in jail, lose our library cards!
Screech, this is the only chance you'll ever have to find out Lisa's innermost thoughts about you.
What are we standing around for?
Hey, make sure you hide that well.
I'll place the wire under this rug.
You've got to admit this about us, Screech I'm good.
Done, Zack.
Now I just have to make sure the wire's secure.
You're an electronics genius, "Screecher.
" Be there in a minute, Mom.
- She's home!
Hide!
- Aa-ah!
Can you believe that Tony Kramer tried to make out with me in the middle of "Working Girl"?
What's wrong with that?
I didn't go with him.
I went with Billy Bostwick.
Tony was sitting right behind us and what a jerk- he left his retainer in my hair!
Boys can be so dumb sometimes.
Yeah, but they can be so cute, too.
Zack, she said we're cute!
I know, this is great.
Hey, now we have to listen for hidden meanings.
Pass the pepperoni.
Lisa wants you.
She does, doesn't she?
I can just picture them now.
You're so lucky you found your Prince Charming, Lisa.
Yeah, next to Screech, River Phoenix is a drip.
I'm so jealous.
May I have a lock of his hair?
Why?
I want to grow my own Screech in a jar.
Yeah, I know how you feel.
Screech is everything a girl could want.
He's strong, yet sensitive.
Funny, but not silly.
And he makes me tingle all over.
Yeah.
Zack, I make her tinkle.
- You know what?
- Quiet, listen.
Sometimes I wonder why God ever invented boys.
To give us something to talk about at slumber parties.
Do you guys think I should cut my hair?
Who cares about your hair?
Get back to boys.
- I like it longer.
- Well Jason wants me to cut it.
Jason touches her hair, he's a dead man.
Lisa, you would really cut your hair if some boy wanted you to?
Well, maybe.
If he was someone special, who had the qualities of let's say, Michael Jackson.
Oooh!
Gentle, talented, gorgeous, and light on his feet.
Hey, if that ain't you, I don't know who it is.
What about you, Kelly?
Who's your dream guy?
Here we go, here we go!
You know who really is a hunk?
- Who?
- Dennis Quaid!
That wuss?
We know you're not taking Dennis Quaid to the dance So who are you going with?
Slater or Zack?
Yes, yes!
The moment of truth.
Well, there's something mysterious about AC Slater.
But Zack Morris is kind of cute in a playful way.
If I had to make my decision right now, I'd pick Zack.
Yes!
What was that?
Go Lakers!
Did you see that shot?
What shot?
- That was Zack.
- Well, what's he doing?
That's weird, the Lakers aren't playing tonight.
I don't believe this you guys.
We've been bugged.
What's wrong, Screech?
I don't know.
Maybe the Lakers game interfered with it.
There is no Lakers game, you idiot.
Oh yeah?
Then what were you screaming at, you bonehead?
Just fix it.
It was just starting to get good.
Of all the lowest, underhanded things this is unreal.
To think a guy would go through all this trouble, just to find out what a girl thinks of him.
It's so romantic.
No, it's so illegal.
Zack's violating our privacy.
Look, guys, it's just a stupid prank.
Let's not get angry.
Let's get even.
What do you mean?
I've got an idea to get Zack back.
But I'm going to need your help.
Okay, everybody ready?
Would you pass the cola?
Zack, it's working!
Okay, okay, I've got a game.
Every girl has to tell her deepest, darkest secret- something she's never told anyone before.
All right!
We got it back just in time for the juicy stuff.
Okay, I'll go first.
It was in the mall.
I once stole a tube of lipstick.
Whoa!
Boring!
How about you Kelly?
Well, mine's more serious than that.
You see, whenever I like a boy, for some strange reason, I end up hurting him.
You mean, you break up with him right?
No, I mean, I hurt him.
Oooh.
This is creepy.
You see, first I get this terrible headache, then something happens, and I snap.
You poor thing.
Zack, she sounds weird.
Quiet, I have to listen to this.
I black out, then wake up the police are there and that poor boy.
The poor boy?
The poor boy what?
Zack, Kelly's dangerous.
Oh come on, Screech.
She's a girl.
Zack, I'm worried.
Girls can be brutal.
You ever see "Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling"?
Come on, you don't think she's going to hurt me?
Do you?
Oh, my God.
I'm not like other boys.
You're not like anything on this planet, you dork!
I'd like you to share your life with me.
Screech, beat it, or I'll give you that high voice permanently.
Excuse me, "Michael," but we have a dress code at this school.
- My office.
Now.
- Mr. Belding, it's me Screech!
Jessie, wait a second.
I've got to talk to you.
Talk fast, Zack.
You don't- I mean, I don't have much time.
I tried to call you all weekend and you're never home.
I know.
I had to spend a lot of time with Kelly.
She really needed me.
She needed you?
Something wrong with Kelly?
I really shouldn't be talking about this.
I've got to go.
Jessie, what are you trying to tell me?
Look, Zack, I really care for you.
Well, I just don't want to see you get hurt.
You mean emotionally hurt?
No, "Mike Tyson" hurt.
What are you trying to tell me?
Look, we've been friends all our lives and I just don't want to see anything happen to you.
Goodbye, Zack.
"Goodbye"?
Look, what is going on here?
Wow, what happened to you?
Hey, I don't want to talk about it.
What?
Were you in an accident?
Fall down a flight of stairs?
Well then, what?
You swear you won't tell anybody?
Yeah, sure.
Well, Kelly beat me up.
She beat you up?
- But you're on the wrestling team.
- Yeah, I know.
It's humiliating, Zack.
You know, I should have been able to take her.
Then what happened?
Kelly asked me over last night.
And it was going great for a while.
But then she got this terrible headache, and then she turned on me.
- Well, what'd she do?
- I don't remember.
The next thing I knew I woke up and I was in some emergency room.
I'm telling you, Zack.
Please be careful.
She told me she likes you more than me.
"Harris Jennings " Bingo!
"Kapowski.
" I've got to find out the truth about Kelly.
That's why I'm looking through the principal's files.
Medical history- measles, mumps oh no- six months in the Riverside Home for the Criminally Insane?
It's true.
She really is dangerous.
Kelly wants to kill me.
Mr. Belding!
Morris, what are you doing in my office?
Mr. Belding, thank goodness you're here.
I need your help.
My life is being threatened by one of your students.
Just one?
You're losing your touch.
Mr. Belding, this is serious.
Okay, okay, who is it?
Terrible Tommy Tanner, or Norman "No Neck" Nunzio?
Neither.
Kelly "The Killer" Kapowski.
Kelly Kapowski?
Excuse me for a moment.
What's she going to do, spike you to death with a volleyball?
Look, this isn't funny.
It's like "Fatal Attraction"- she loves me and I'm dead meat.
Zack, maybe you're making too much out of this.
When you're a ladies' man, you're going to make girls mad sometimes.
You cannot please them all.
Look, you don't understand.
Kelly gets these headaches and- They all get headaches, Morris.
Mr. Belding, please help me!
Relax, Zack.
I know where you're coming from.
Hey, I was also a big ladies' man.
Sometimes they're going to act a little out of sorts.
You just chalk it up to hormones.
You think that's all it is, sir?
I'm positive.
Hey, I've been around.
You've got nothing to worry about.
Unless of course she's that one rare wacko who's been in an institution or something.
Tonight's assignment will be chapter six: "The Colon: Your Friend for Life.
" My dearest Zack, you can run but you can't hide.
Sorry, Zack.
Clumsy me.
Will someone please call 911?
I finally have you all to myself.
Uh, what are you going to do with me?
And what's the bat for?
Softball practice, silly.
Sure, is that what you told Slater?
I want you, Zack.
Not just for the dance, but forever.
Forever is such a long time.
But it can be a very short time, too.
Don't fight it, Zack.
You know you like me.
Sure I do, but I also like cheeseburgers, and I like the Lakers, I like life.
I love life.
Kiss me, Zack, and change both of our lives forever.
- Aa-ah!
- What, what?
I've got one of those headaches again.
Me too.
I'll go get the aspirin.
Come back, Zack, please.
What about the dance?
- I already have a date.
- With who?
Is this a blast, or what?
Rhonda, that's our 53rd dance.
Can I please take a break?
Sure, take five.
I'll go wash my face and floss for later.
- Haven't you had enough?
- I like living on the edge.
Having fun with Rhonda, Zackie?
I should have let you kill me when you had the chance.
I'm totally harmless, Zack.
I want to return something that belongs to you.
You mean you know we were listening?
Oh, I have something for you too, Zack.
A copy of Kelly's diploma from the Home for the Criminally Insane.
Wait a minute.
You planted this in Belding's files?
We both did.
We flirted with danger and we won.
I knew you'd break into the files to check on Kelly.
I know how your sick mind works.
I can't believe this.
Hey, I've got another surprise for you, Zackie.
You can use this to fight off Rhonda.
You guys were all in on this?
I just have to know one thing, Kelly.
You were going to go to the dance with me, right?
Guess you'll never know.
Come on, Slater.
Let's go dance.
Don't fade on me now, Zackie, I got big plans for us.
- Big plans?
- Yeah.
Mom's visiting Dad in the slammer and we got the house all to ourselves.
Sorry, Rhonda, I have a curfew.
I have to be home in 10 minutes.
- That's all right.
- Ow!
How about a goodnight kiss?
I have very strict rules about that.
I don't kiss on the first date.
Lucky for us I do.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
When l wake up in the morning and the alarm gives out a warning l don't think l'll ever make it on time By the time l grab my books and l give myself a look l'm at the corner just in time to see the bus fly by lt's all right 'Cause l'm saved by the bell lf the teacher pops a test, l know l'm in a mess And my dog ate all my homework last night Ridin' low on my chair, she won't know that l'm there lf l can hand it in tomorrow it'll be all right lt's all right 'Cause l'm saved by the bell lt's all right, 'cause l'm saved by the-- lt's all right, 'cause l'm saved by the-- lt's all right, 'cause l'm saved by the bell.
Slater, we are a great team.
We are not only going to get an A on this project, but we are also going to win that science medal.
Hey, and all we have to do now is just pick a name for the volcano.
Oh, if you don't mind, l was thinking of Mount Saint Jessie.
Uh, how about, Slater's Crater?
All right, l'll compromise.
We'll call it Jessie's Crater.
Come on, let's see how she works.
No, no, come on.
You've got to pour in more.
Let me do it.
Be careful!
Don't pour in too mu-- How do you get this thing to stop?
l don't know.
l was absent that day.
Come on.
l told you not to pour so much in.
Do you know how hard it is to get lava stains out of your clothes?
You see that?
ln four days, my science project is due.
lf l don't get an A, l'll be doing hard time in summer school.
Screech!
What are you doing with our project?
You're supposed to be home working on it.
- l needed a break.
- Hey, you know our arrangement, you do the work, l take the breaks.
Well, aren't you going to do any work at all, Zack?
Well, no.
lf l worked on it, you'd just have to do it over again.
l'm saving you time, and that's the thanks l get.
l'm sorry.
Thanks, Zack.
- What is that thing?
- lt's our science project.
lt's an electro-magnetic aerial hymenoptera detector.
- What's it do?
- Zack: What's it do?
What's it do, Screech?
Well, right now, all it does is make my canary fly into the wall.
But once it's finished, it'll be an early warning system.
- For what?
- Enemy canaries.
Look, guys.
There she is.
My dream girl.
Screech, if you really like Lisa, go for it.
Let her know how you feel.
- You really think so?
- Absolutely.
Don't give up.
- Give love a chance.
- Oh, l agree.
Why don't we go to the drive-in and give it a chance?
Well, l'm afraid l'll fall off your bicycle.
l'm making my move.
Don't do it.
Screech, love and science don't mix.
Did you ever see Einstein with a chick?
No, Zack.
Kelly's right.
This is my one moment in time.
l guess l caught her at a bad time.
Well, don't give up.
He's really not her type.
They must be serious.
He's chewing her gum now.
l don't understand.
Why don't girls like me?
Oh!
l have some theories.
Me too.
l'm snake spit.
Hey, Screech, would you turn on the machine?
Turn it on yourself.
Hey, would you forget about Lisa?
Look, l'm positive l can find another girl who'll like you.
- You really mean it?
- Yeah, absolutely.
Before you even approach a girl, you gotta act like you believe in yourself.
Let me see that.
Come on.
That's it?
l don't have much to believe in, Zack.
You gotta practice being cool.
What you need is a great opening line, something to grab her attention.
How about, ''Hello''?
lf you say hello, you'll hear ''Goodbye.
'' lt's better than what l usually get.
What l mean is, ''Hey, how much did the other contestants pay you to drop out of the Miss Universe contest?
'' Wow, is that what really goes on?
No, you idiot!
l'm just showing you what to do.
Hey, there's Sally Dunsky.
Go for it.
lt's like shooting fish in a barrel.
Are you looking for something?
No babe, l found it.
Are you all right?
Hup!
l learned that trick from the Chinese acrobats.
Your opening line!
Say something cool.
Did you know that worms are a source of protein?
Why don't you go eat some?
The Miss Universe line.
What l meant to say was, ''How much did you have to pay the contestants to get into the Miss Universe contest?
'' Get lost, creep.
- How about lunch?
- How about death?
Screech.
Aw, Screech, come out.
Believe me, it's not the end of the world.
Ha!
Come on, talk to me, Screech.
Why can't l meet someone who will give me a chance?
Someone who will ignore my stupid hair and my different-colored socks and see the real me.
- Well, that is the real you.
- Yeah.
l'm hummingbird droppings.
Hey, you know, l just thought of someone who might like you.
Who?
Who?
Take a few laps around the gym and let me work on it.
Sure thing, Zack.
Hey, Jessie, can l talk to you for a minute?
l have a problem.
l know that Zack, but we've all learned to live with it.
No, no.
l'm serious.
See, l have this friend.
And girls don't like him because he looks different.
That's so unfair.
lt shouldn't matter what a person looks like.
Look at ''Beauty and the Beast.
'' He is a wonderful person inside.
So is my friend.
He even smells better than the Beast.
He just needs someone to give him a chance.
- l'll give him a chance.
- Well, good!
lf you like him, maybe you two can start dating?
- Maybe.
Who is he?
- Screech.
Screech?
Are you crazy?
Me go out with Screech?
Ugh!
ls that a yes or a no?
Zack, l ran as fast as l could.
Did you talk to the girl?
When can l meet her?
Meet her?
Gee, Screech, l don't know.
Well, if l can't meet her, l'll call her.
Well, actually, maybe it would be better if she called you.
Yeah, yeah, that would work.
As a matter of fact, she did say she'd call you.
3:30 at the payphone.
Zack, l owe you my life!
l'd rather have the science project.
You got it.
All right!
Woo!
Now all l have to do is find a girl for Screech.
Well, babe, let's be reasonable.
l can't come for lunch.
What do you mean, if l loved you l'd find a way?
You're in ltaly.
Can you please hurry?
Hey this phone is occupato, paisan.
l need that phone, and l'm prepared to take it by force if necessary.
Angela, yeah, l have to go.
My life is being threatened by a bully.
Arrivederci.
Hey, look, Screech, what's so important about this phone call?
l'm expecting a call.
lt's from a girl.
You've got a woman calling you?
On purpose?
Yeah, l get around.
Ah, who am l kidding?
l'm scared to death.
- l don't know what to do.
- Well, be yourself.
l can't, l want to impress her.
Don't try to impress anybody.
Be proud of what you are, whatever that is.
Look, she's probably more nervous than you are.
You really think so?
When that phone rings, be strong.
Thanks, Slater.
Hello?
This is Screech.
ls this Zack's friend?
What's that?
You've seen me around?
And you like me?
Please hold.
What's your name?
My name is, uh Bambi.
Look, l know this is kind of sudden, but l have to tell you the way l feel.
You know, l've been watching you for a long time.
You're really cute.
Belding: That may be so, but this is neither the time nor the place to share those feelings.
Young lady, the mens room is one of the few doors education should not open for you.
Now don't misunderstand, l am flattered that you think so highly of me.
But Bambi, it's not really love you feel for me, it's hero worship.
Rock stars, ball players, principals-- heck, we excite people.
Bambi?
Are you there, Bambi?
Hey, l think she ran back into the forest with Thumper.
Belding: Who is that?
Hey, it's Slater, Mr. Belding.
What have you done with Bambi?
- Who's Bambi?
- Well, she's a girl, and she was just in here with me.
Oh, really?
Well, not actually in here with me.
There's a really good explanation for this and l wish l could find it.
Hey it's all right, Mr. Belding.
Why don't we just keep this between the three of us?
Good idea.
Thank you.
Just thank me at report card time.
l am never going to the bathroom again.
Good morning, world.
Hey, Zack.
l talked to Bambi again last night.
l know.
l mean, how'd it go?
She makes me feel like a young buck.
- Who's Bambi?
- She's a girl Zack found for me.
You found a girl for Screech?
l'm so relieved.
l mean, l'm so happy.
Hi, guys.
l'm taken, Lisa.
Eat your heart out.
Wow, you must really like this Bambi.
Oh, Jessie, you've got to meet her.
Wait a minute.
l've got to meet her.
- You haven't met her yet?
- You don't understand.
- He can't meet her.
- Why can't he meet her?
Yeah, why can't he meet her?
Well, because, uh because she's not what you think.
She's having an identity crisis.
Oh.
Way to go, Zack.
Anyone who thinks what l did to Screech was mean, raise your hand.
Ah, come on.
He'll be over Bambi in a few hours.
Hey everybody, come quick.
You've got to see this.
Screech, what are you doing?
Demonstrating my love for Bambi.
Come on, Screech.
Stop fooling around.
- l'm not fooling around.
- Oh, my gosh.
l can't eat, l can't sleep, l can't do science projects.
l'm not leaving this locker till l meet Bambi, Zack.
l couldn't help it, Mr. Belding.
l'm in love.
Screech, l'm fully aware that people your age form rather intense attachments.
But they usually wear a locket, not a locker.
Jenny, have we heard anything from maintenance?
Jenny: No.
Please call them again and tell them l'm still waiting for them.
Jenny: Who is this?
Thank you.
Listen, Screech, l sympathize with you, but there's really nothing l can do.
There's something Zack can do.
He knows Bambi personally.
Bambi?
ls this the Bambi?
- ls that who we're talking about?
- You know her?
Well, l've sat and talked with her recently.
Leave this to me.
Zack Morris, l need you.
- You called?
- Yes, l did.
Unfortunately, only you can help this boy.
Please have Bambi at The Max at 4:00 to meet with him.
That's beyond impossible.
Zack, let's talk man to man, ''mano y mano.
'' Now, officially l cannot order you to do this, but if Bambi's not there, well, this could be your most miserable semester yet.
- Screech: Uh, Mr. Belding?
- Mm-hmm.
l have to go to the bathroom.
Jenny, get maintenance up here right now.
Code blue!
Jenny: Who is this?
-  - Come in.
- l got here as fast as l could.
- Thanks Lisa, l won't forget this.
Neither will l. What's she doing here?
l had to go pick up my color wheel at Jessie's.
And Jessie said, ''Why?
'' l said, ''Zack needs it.
'' Jessie said, ''Why?
'' So l told her about Screech and Jessie said-- l wouldn't miss this for the world.
Great.
Let's just get on with it.
Yeah, we don't have much time.
Here, Bambi.
Oh, ha ha.
You think this is fun for me?
You think l want to dress up like a girl?
Well, this is repulsive, disgusting, revolting-- can l see something in a blue?
Yeah, you're right.
This might be a little forward for a first date.
This is a first date, right?
Well, l better get started on his nails.
Oh, now wait a second.
Here, make yourself useful.
l don't need to shave.
Your legs.
Excuse me sir, but a Mr. Screech has reserved that table.
- lt's me, Max.
- Screech!
You look great.
l didn't recognize you.
l'm meeting a girl in here.
Are those for your date?
They're almost dead, but that's all they had left at the market.
Well, she might like these better.
Thanks, Max, but isn't there a little something missing?
Well, they're late bloomers.
Thanks.
l am getting front row seats for this.
l prefer the balcony.
Enjoy the show.
You too.
l want you to know that l'm taking the names of everyone who's laughing.
Hi there.
Who are you?
Your worst nightmare, pal.
- Screech?
- Bambi?
Oh boy!
l mean, sit down.
My, it's a lot brighter in here than l thought it'd be.
Good, then everyone'll see you.
Dream come true.
Gosh, you're pretty.
And you have the most feminine little hands.
- Do not.
- Do too.
- Do not!
- Do too.
Would you like to meet some of my friends?
- No.
No.
- Oh, come on.
Slater, meet my date.
This is Bambi.
Oh, so you're the famous Bambi, huh?
l've heard all about you from Mr. Belding.
Oh, Richard and l are just good friends.
Hey, there's Kelly.
Come on.
Whoa.
This little guy has good taste.
Fresh.
Morris?
Nice legs.
Bambi, this is Kelly.
Nice to meet you.
Don't l know you from somewhere?
l don't know.
Were you ever a Brownie?
Yes, l was.
What troop were you in?
Um F-Troop.
Nice one.
Slater, please, l beg you.
Don't worry, your secret's safe with me, sweetheart.
Hey, Screech, Lisa's just doing that to make you jealous.
Now, if you kissed Bambi, hey, that would show her.
Um um all right, but on one condition.
- lf we kiss, we become an item.
- l can live with that.
Hey Kelly, why don't we leave these two lovebirds alone?
Hey, if it doesn't work out with you and Screech, call me.
Now Screech, if we're going to date, you've got to follow my rules.
Rules?
What rules?
My rules of livin' and lovin'.
You must follow them explicitly.
- What are they?
- Rule number one: Straighten your hair and dye it blond.
Consider me Billy ldol.
Well then, uh, rule number two: l'm allergic to all types of animals.
Done.
l'll shave my birds.
All right.
Here's number three, the most important: l'm very possessive, and l must have you all to myself.
Get rid of your friend Zack Morris.
- That's all?
-  That's all?
l mean, what?
Well, Zack is awfully cocky.
He's always taking advantage of me, and sometimes l think he underestimates my intelligence.
But he is my friend and l'm sorry, but l won't trade him for anything else in the world.
Not even you, Bambi.
You mean, you're dumping me?
l hope l haven't hurt you.
l hope l haven't hurt you.
No, actually you've helped me.
You've made me realize there are a million fish in the sea and l'm just the worm to attract them.
Now if you'll excuse me, l have a science project that needs finishing.
Well, you better hurry it if it's due Friday.
You know, l watched what you did here today for Screech, it was really nice.
Sick, but nice.
Come on, you know l did it because l wanted him to finish the project.
Well, maybe.
But you also did it 'cause you're his friend too.
You know, actually l had a good time.
lt was better than most first dates.
l'm going to the girls room.
You want to come?
Oh, why not?
Sounds like fun.
Freeze!
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}

Everyone hopes for that one shining moment-- Joe Montana in the Super Bowl; Kirk Gibson in the World Series; ''Flo-Jo'' in the Olympics, and today, Zack Morris in the Bayside vs.
Madison Cross-Country Meet.
Oh hi, Zack.
How did you do in the race?
Well, l don't like to brag but Third place, Zack.
That's great!
You know, l have a feeling that at some country fair there is a prize bull wondering where his ribbon went.
Third place, wow!
l once finished fifth in an ''ALF'' look-a-like contest.
For the first quarter mile, l held back.
At the half mile, l was still in last place.
At the three-quarter mile, l heard this voice-- - Hey guys, look at this.
- Slater, what a great trophy!
l won my weight class in the county wrestling championships.
- Wow, that's fabulous.
- This is awesome.
Oh my gosh.
That is so exciting.
You're a champion.
l am so proud of you!
Then, ignoring the pain in my side, l made a mad dash to the finish-- Hey Zack, would you hold this for me, please?
l want to hug Kelly with both arms.
Oh Slater, put me down.
l can't watch this.
Let's hear it for our first county wrestling champion, in fact, our first champion in anything, AC Slater!
Would you teach me how to wrestle?
Slater, show me that hold you used to beat Johnson.
You know, that double-jointed torso stretcher.
Don't worry, Slater.
l won't hurt you.
All right.
Oof!
Hey, this is pretty effective.
Thank you.
l'll ease up if you do.
l'm just going to go help the nurse look for a contact lens.
Hey Zack, Slater isn't that great.
You could do that too if you had muscles.
Excuse me.
l'm Major Martin Slater.
l'm looking for-- - AC Slater's father?
- Affirmative.
Tell me, son, how do you find Mr. Belding?
Confused, but well-meaning.
He's not in his office.
Where can l find him?
- He's with the school nurse.
- Where's the school nurse?
She's with Mr. Belding.
l know that.
Where's her office?
Then l'll go this way.
Zack, the nurse's office is that way.
l know.
But when a father comes to school, it's important.
We've got to find out what's going on.
- Let's go to Belding's office.
- Why?
l have a plan.
l have a meeting at 1400 hours.
l'll get to the point, Mr. Belding.
''1400 hours.
'' Now that brings back memories.
Proud to say l served my country in the Fighting 55th.
- 'Nam?
- lndiana.
National Guard.
l'll sleep better at night knowing that.
Major?
Mr. Belding, l've been offered a transfer to Hawaii, and l'm here to let you know that my son will be going with me.
What does AC think about this?
l found out this morning, l haven't talked to him yet.
Major-- sir, AC has found a home here.
He's a good student, a great athlete, very popular with the girls.
He gets almost as many whistles around the pool as l do.
That's hard to believe.
Mr. Belding l know my son.
l know what he wants.
Belding: Could you at least talk to him and see how he feels about this?
We've talked about going to Hawaii for years.
But go ahead and call him if you want.
AC Slater, to the principal's office, please.
l'll need AC's transcripts.
Yes, sir.
Major, l want you to know that l think AC is a very bright, well-adjusted young man.
Thank you.
- Dad.
- Hi, son.
l've got great news.
We finally got that chance to go to Hawaii.
Yeah, Dad.
That's great.
That doesn't make you happy?
Well, l like it here in this school, Dad.
Why?
Major, what l think your son is trying to say, is that he's never had a principal quite like me before.
Yes, that's true, Mr. Belding.
You're one of a kind.
Seems to be more here than l thought.
Could you excuse us for a moment?
Certainly, sir.
10-4.
Same to you.
Sit down, son.
l thought you wanted to go to Hawaii.
Well l did, when we were in lceland.
But l have real friends here for a change.
lf l had to leave them, l'd really miss them, Dad.
Don't you want to go?
l don't know what l want.
All right.
l've got to let my C.O. know by Friday.
So that gives you four days to make up your mind.
l'm sorry you were stuck in the file cabinet for so long.
That's all right.
Just paint me blue and call me a ''smurf.
'' So what'd you find out about Slater?
Well, his father is being transferred to Hawaii.
Slater has until Friday to decide if he's going to stay or leave.
Slater gets to decide?
Yeah, and you'd better hope he chooses Hawaii.
Why?
Zack, look at yourself.
Before Slater, you were the big cheese, the main man, - head honcho, top dog-- - Okay!
A-number-one, king of the hill, master of your destiny-- Enough already!
And worst of all, Kelly's stuck on him like crazy glue.
You better pray he chooses Hawaii or you're a dead man with Kelly.
''Dead man''?
Hawaii?
Hmmm Zack!
No!
Wait!
Slater's what?
- He's dying.
- He's dying?
Zack, that is ridiculous.
Slater's father met with Belding yesterday.
l bugged his office.
- You wouldn't do that.
- Trust me.
He would do that.
How can Slater be dying?
He won the wrestling title.
One last heroic burst of strength is a symptom of the disease.
What disease?
lt's called ''mumbio-quadralation osis.
'' lt affects the brain.
Then l think you have it too.
There's a clinic in Hawaii that can treat mumbio-- whatever, but that big brave galoot would rather live out his remaining days here with his friends.
We have to find some way to get him to go to that clinic.
- How are we going to do that?
- l don't know.
Maybe by pretending we don't want him around anymore?
- Oh that is crazy.
- Crazy?
Well sure, it's crazy.
But if you care about Slater at all, you'll treat him like dirt.
-  - Come in.
- Mr. Belding?
- Hi, Jessie.
What can l do for you?
Did Slater's father really come to see you yesterday?
- Yes, he did.
- Oh l didn't think so.
Sorry to bother you.
- Did you say yes?
- Afraid so.
Then it's true Slater won't be with us much longer?
Might as well kiss him goodbye.
He's out of here.
l can't believe this.
Poor Slater.
Poor Slater?
Where am l going to find another star wrestler?
How can you worry about wrestling at a time like this?
Jessie, life goes on.
People come and go.
You win some, you lose some.
Mr. Belding, that is so insensitive.
Slater's going to a better place.
We should all be so lucky.
This is all just so sudden.
lt usually is.
Let's just make his last few days with us special.
Last few days?
l heard six months.
No way.
Two weeks, tops.
My guess is he'll probably be gone by the end of the week.
This whole thing is just so unbelievable.
l know.
l thought so too until l talked to Belding.
Well, according to the medical book l read, Slater's not in any immediate danger unless symptoms appear.
What symptoms?
Sneezing, itching, loss of memory Shh.
Here he comes.
- Hey guys, how's it going?
- Great.
How are you?
- l've been better.
-  By the way, where were you?
You were supposed to meet me in the weight room last period.
What are you talking about?
Oh.
l guess he forgot.
What's wrong with them?
lt was ''Peel An Onion Day'' in Home Ec.
You're late.
Do you have the stuff?
Yep.
One deluxe ant farm, with five generations of ants.
All lined up according to height.
Okay, let's step on it.
Zack, never let ants hear you say, ''Step on it.
'' l meant hurry up.
Now, pour the pepper on me.
- Okay, that's good.
-  Okay, this is study hall.
- Can l borrow a pencil?
- Yeah, sure, Preppie.
Ah-choo!
Ah-choo!
Oh, he's sneezing.
Hey!
This is study hall, not ''Soul Train.
'' Slater's fading fast.
We've got to get him to Hawaii to save his life!
The ''Treat Slater Like Dirt Show'' is about to begin.
By the time it's over, Slater will be in Hawaii and Kelly will be all mine.
lt's show time.
Hi Jessie.
lt's a great day, huh?
lt's a terrible day.
You can't even breathe the air.
What are you, stupid?
What are you talking about?
What's wrong?
You are what's wrong.
- Hi, Lisa.
- Don't talk to me.
- Why not?
- You're one of those dumb jocks.
You didn't think so yesterday when l won my trophy.
You're a conceited dumb jock.
Well, that's the worst kind.
- Hey Slater, how's it going?
- l'm afraid to say.
Hey, well don't worry about it.
Everybody has bad days.
But not everybody has a trophy to remind you of the good ones.
That's one thing they'll never be able to take away from you.
My trophy!
Where is it?
Well, this is disgraceful.
Vandals must have stolen it and melted it down.
By now it's probably Andre the Giant's shoehorn.
l can't believe this.
l hate this school.
There he is.
Places, people.
Hi Kelly.
Wait a second.
Are we still on for the beach this afternoon?
No way.
- What's wrong with her?
- Oh l don't know.
She just saw you coming in, then said, ''Here comes that muscle-bound pea brain, Slater.
'' She said that?
Hey, would l have the guts to make it up?
What's happening here, Screech?
Nobody wants me around anymore.
Can you blame them, ''Brillo head''?
Hi, Slater.
You're looking a little pale.
l want to tell you guys that l have the chance to move to Hawaii.
You're going, right?
Oops.
Yeah, that's right.
l'm going.
l'm moving to Hawaii.
- Oh, yes!
- And l'm going with him.
What have l done?
Why'd you say you were coming to Hawaii with me?
Because l care about you.
l'm going to ask my parents if l can stay with my uncle in Honolulu and take care of you.
What do you mean, ''take care'' of me?
l couldn't bear for you to live the last days of your life alone.
What?
lt's all right, Slater.
Zack told us everything.
Exactly how much did Zack tell you?
He told us all about your tropical disease.
About the sneezing, itching, memory lapses.
Listen l really appreciate your offer to come to Hawaii with me.
l can't think of anyone l'd rather spend my last days with than you Jessie.
- Slater, l'm Kelly.
- Oops.
Memory lapse.
Zack, l've been looking all over for you.
- For me?
- l don't want to go to Hawaii.
- Zack, you've got to help me.
- You've got it made.
Kelly's going with you.
She doesn't care about me.
l'm just her ticket to Hawaii.
Zack, l feel so used.
Don't go.
Let Kelly use you here.
lt's too late.
l told my father l wanted to go.
You only get one chance with the major.
So tell him you changed your mind.
l'm afraid.
l'm not good at those things like you are, Zack.
You're so persuasive.
Wait a minute.
Would you mind talking to him for me?
l'd really-- Time out.
Wait a minute.
Would l talk to his father?
This is too good to be true.
l mean, if Slater stays, Kelly stays.
Time in.
Sure, if you think it'll make a difference.
Oh, thanks, Zack.
lt will, it will.
Are you sure we're not overdoing it, son?
Dad, Zack needs to be taught a lesson he'll never forget.
l want him to think he's meeting General Patton.
Hey, l'll make Patton look like a pansy.
- Everything set?
- Yeah.
Dad Are you sure it's okay we're not going to Hawaii?
Well, l was disappointed at first.
But, if you're happy here, l can learn to become a Dodger fan.
-  - Well, let's let the enemy in.
Oh, you forgot your bandage, Dad.
Ahem -  - Come in.
Mr. Slater?
lt's Major Slater.
You must be Minor Morris.
Well, yes Major, l'm a minor.
Whatever you say, sir.
Well, what is it you want from me?
You've got three minutes.
- Ooh, oh, that smarts.
- Are you okay?
A slight accident on the grenade range.
Brain concussion.
Nothing serious.
Excuse me while l call the base.
Base!
You've got two minutes.
Well sir-- Major sir, l don't want your son AC to go to Hawaii.
Why should he stay?
They stole his trophy, cold-shouldered him.
And a girl named Kelly used him.
Well, that's not exactly true, sir.
- Are you calling me a liar?
- No!
Drop!
Give me 10!
Two, three-- hurry, hurry, the Russians are in Burbank!
Hi.
l'm Major Slater.
What is it you wanted to talk to me about, soldier?
Well Major, l was the one that made everybody cold-shoulder AC.
l was jealous of his trophy and tried to get him to leave.
Oh, you're the one.
- What's that?
- Oh, just a live grenade.
A live grenade?
Do you know how these work?
Just pull the pin, like this.
As long as you hold that clip, nothing will happen.
But if you were to let go of that clip, it could blow up everyone who did you wrong in four seconds.
Three two -  - one  Boom.
Max: And so we bid goodbye to our brave warrior.
As the sun dips into farewell we say, ''Aloha, Slater,'' as he is welcomed to paradise by the ''Pineapple Princess.
'' My pineapple bra is killing me.
Which means, let's hula down!
All: Hey!
Hey!
Ho!
- Mona lalla, Lisa.
- What's that mean?
''You make my blood bubble like hot lava.
'' Well, mona lalla-lalla-- ''Go sit on a volcano.
'' Here's a going-away gift from all your friends.
lt's a man-eating plant!
Thanks, Max.
Hey you guys, this is all really nice, but l don't deserve all this.
- Slater, is that you?
- Hey where'd you get my trophy?
Oh, it's a surprise.
l asked Belding to have it engraved.
Aloha, pal.
Stop him, Pineapple Princess.
His Majesty beckons you.
Hey, you guys, l have really great news.
l'm not going to Hawaii.
But you have to.
You have a disease.
You'll die here.
Hey, l'm healthy.
l never was sick.
l just used it to get back at Zack.
You're not sick?
That is sick!
You mean you're not leaving?
- You used me?
- l thought she used you.
No, l used her to use you for you using me.
Sounds like a ''used person lot.
'' - This is the lowest.
- lt was only to get back at Morris.
Well you two can have each other.
Come on, Screech.
Compared to these two, you look good.
Which means, ''Thanks for being slimeballs.
'' - They'll get over it.
- You think so?
l've been putting them through this since the first grade and l'm still here.
- You mad l'm staying?
- Not really.
There's nobody l'd rather beat than you.
Dream on, Preppie.
Because right now l'm the king.
Over my dead body.
Oh, that reminds me, my dad asked me to give you this.
Three two one
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
When l wake up in the morning and the alarm gives out a warning l don't think l'll ever make it on time By the time l grab my books and l give myself a look l'm at the corner just in time to see the bus fly by lt's all right 'Cause l'm saved by the bell lf the teacher pops a test, l know l'm in a mess And my dog ate all my homework last night Ridin' low on my chair, she won't know that l'm there lf l can hand it in tomorrow it'll be all right lt's all right 'Cause l'm saved by the bell lt's all right, 'cause l'm saved by the-- lt's all right, 'cause l'm saved by the-- lt's all right, 'cause l'm saved by the bell.
Teenage girls are suckers for the great poets, like Jon Bon Jovi, Axl Rose, Jazzy Jeff.
And l found this romantic dude who's going to help me win Kelly's heart-- Rap master Will Shakespeare.
l suppose they're not going to ring the bell, so we'll start anyway.
All right, class.
We're going to perform passages from the balcony scene in ''Romeo and Juliet.
'' And do we all know who the author is?
William Shakespeare.
Shame on you!
William Shakespeare.
Now, our first-- our first Juliet will be Miss Turtle.
Do we have any volunteers for our first Romeo?
Me, me!
Then l'll have to pick someone.
Anyone but Screech.
That's a wonderful suggestion.
Mr. Screech, you may begin.
''But, soft!
What light through yonder window breaks?
'' Give me a break.
''lt is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
'' Arise, dear Juliet and let's cutteth to the chase.
- Back off, Romeo.
- O fair maiden, l long to plant one on thy lips, so pucker up-eth!
Drop deadeth!
Oh, wonderful.
But the swordfight didn't come until later.
Now, we're going to need two more volunteers.
For Romeo How about you, Mr. Slater?
Hey, don't worry, the wrestling team will never hear about this from me Romeo.
Ms. Simpson, as much as l would love to do this, Morris here, he's a much better actor.
He could be another Pee Wee Herman.
Mr. Morris, very well.
And for Juliet?
Hey, Kelly, there's a spider on your chair!
Oh, Miss Kapowski.
Excellent.
Hey, hey wait!
Okay, Ms. Simpson, l'll do it.
l'm sorry, you're too late.
We already have a Juliet.
Now then, why don't we transform ''yon'' desk into a balcony, so that we may realize the full impact of this dramatic scene?
All right, Romeo.
You spy your beloved at her window, and you begin.
Check it out.
''lt 'tis my lady, O it 'tis my love.
O, that she knew she were!
Her eyes in heaven shone so bright That birds would sing and think it were not night.
O, see how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
O, that l were a glove upon that hand, That l might touch that cheek!
'' Wow!
Stay putteth, Juliet.
Oh, drat!
There goes my back again!
- Ms. Simpson are you all right?
- This happens every now and again.
lt's an old hockey injury.
We've got to get you to the nurse.
Thank you, Miss Spano, but l really don't think l can walk in this position.
No sweat, Ms. Simpson, l've got an idea.
Okay now, don't worry, Ms. Simpson, we'll get you to the nurse.
Okay, let's bring her out!
Come on, come on.
Okay now, you've got to take it slow, all right, Ms. Simpson?
- Okay, hold on.
- Careful.
- Whoa.
- Here we go.
- Okay.
- Take it easy.
Here's your sweater, Ms. Simpson.
And here's your briefcase.
Thank you.
That feels like everything.
Hey, hey, hey!
What is going on here?
Well, Ms. Simpson hurt herself, Mr. Belding.
Ms. Simpson, did your back go out again?
No, no.
My back went out again.
We're taking her to the nurse.
Oh, lovely shoes, Mr. Belding.
Woman on  Mr. Belding, hurry to the gymnasium.
Tiny Hartwick is caught in the net again.
l told them to stop using him as a volleyball.
Ms. Simpson, as long as you're going by my office, would you mind dropping these off for me?
- No, not at all.
- Thanks.
- Okay, now hold on.
- Here we go.
Screech, behold!
My lady sits eating.
Shove off, Morris.
l ignore the insults of the ignorant, and approach my love.
Oh, to be that straw, sitting in my lady's cup.
Gladly would l be made of plastic, and risk drowning in a sea of cola, for the chance to touch fair Kelly's lips.
Oh, Zack.
Okay, Preppie.
While you're treading cola, Kelly and l are going to the beach.
Kelly, this news disappoints me verily.
l thought we could rehearse more scenes from ''Romeo and Juliet.
'' That's a great idea, Zack.
Sorry, Slater.
What?
l can't believe this.
You'd rather study than go to beach?
''Parting is such sweet sorrow'' chump!
Fair Lisa, would that l were that blob of ketchup lying on your plate so that you may dip your French fries in my face.
All right everyone, settle down.
Now as you know, Ms. Simpson is in the hospital, so you'll be having a substitute teacher.
l expect you to be on your best behavior, and treat him with the same respect you show me.
Do you really mean that, sir?
Zachary, if l hear anything about exploding chalk, superglue on the chairs, or sneezing powder in the erasers, l'm coming after you.
But sir, that's so unfair.
l'm the principal.
l can be unfair.
Well, let's see what kind of dweeb they throw at us this time.
Good morning, everyone.
l'm Tony Crane.
You're right, Zack.
The guy looks like a dweeb to me.
Why don't you tell me all of your names, starting with you?
- l'm Slater.
- l'm Screech.
l'm yours.
l'm bummed.
Now as you are about to see, l teach Shakespeare just a little differently.
l want you to feel it as well as hear it.
l want you to live it.
Now, all we need is a Juliet.
Okay, Kelly.
Let's turn you into Juliet.
l didn't know Juliet was a conehead.
Shh!
Now remember, above all else ''Romeo and Juliet'' is a love story.
Romeo is so charged with romantic desires, he feels he can fly over walls, that no barrier can possibly separate him from his beloved.
We've all felt that way at some point in our lives, haven't we?
Yes.
He must have read my diary.
Yeah, and then he borrowed your blouse.
''With love's light wings did l o'er-perch these walls; For stony limits cannot hold love out, And what love can do that dares love attempt.
'' ''lf my kinsmen see thee, they will murder thee.
'' - Go kinsmen!
- Guys: Yeah!
''Look thou but sweet, and l am proof against their enmity.
'' Now what do you think that means, Jessie?
Whatever you say, Tony-- l mean Mr. Crane.
Does anyone know what Shakespeare's saying here?
Nothing, he's dead.
l think he's saying love is totally awesome.
No.
Yes, in a way.
Love is so awesome that Romeo feels a sweet look from Juliet will make him invincible.
Okay, we'll continue this tomorrow.
l said we'll continue this tomorrow.
All: We'll wait.
Hey, Kelly, you want to play some Video Bowl?
Sorry, Slater.
l don't have time for kids' games.
We're studying Shakespeare.
Do you mind?
Tony might call on me tomorrow.
Tony?
What's this big deal about Mr. Crane, anyway?
He's nothing special.
You put a headlock on him, he'll go down to the mat just like anyone else.
Slater, you are clearly incapable of appreciating someone like Mr. Crane.
He uses his mind, not his muscles.
What's happening?
We were trying to explain our new substitute to these guys, but l guess you can't expect boys to understand a man.
No, l guess only someone with your sophistication could do that.
You had the root beer float with the Gummi Bear swirl?
Greetings, sweet maidens.
l salute your beauty and grace.
Hi, Zack.
Fair Kelly, shall we again prepare together for class on the morrow?
Sorry, Zack, l don't have time to play dress up.
lt's him!
Hey, Slater, now's your chance to put a headlock on him.
- He sees us!
- What do we do?
We could go to the jukebox.
lt's 10 feet closer to him.
Great idea.
Don't be obvious.
Something's rotten in The Max.
For once, it's not the chili.
lt's going to get worse, Preppie.
l've seen this in other schools l've been to.
Some smooth-talking teacher will come in, before you know it, he's stolen all our women.
He's going to take our mothers?
No, not our mothers, our girls.
Aren't you guys overreacting?
He's probably got a girlfriend of his own.
He could be married.
Yeah, maybe you're right.
l bet he doesn't even know those girls are alive.
Would you girls care to join me?
Sure!
Okay, so he knows they're alive.
What'd l tell you, huh?
This guy is trouble.
Slater, we spend most of our time fighting over Kelly.
But maybe, just for now, we should join forces against the common enemy.
What did l do?
Not you, Screech.
Tony Crane.
So what do you say, Slater?
Agreed.
Truce.
Ow!
That was the most romantic lunch l've ever had.
l'll remember it for as long as l live.
You know, now that l've met Tony, l know that's the kind of man l'm going to marry.
- Oh, me too.
- Personally, l've always thought planning my career was more important than finding a husband until now.
How do l look?
Beautiful.
What about me?
Jessie, you're one of three prettiest brides l've ever seen.
l can't wait for my honeymoon, Tony's taking me to Paris.
l've heard they have great French food there.
Tony and l are going to Hawaii.
- Waikiki?
- Why not?
l've heard it's really romantic.
We're going to the desert for our honeymoon.
l love the beach.
He hates the ocean.
Wait a minute.
How could Tony take me on a honeymoon with both of you?
What kind of fantasy is this?
-  - All: lt's him.
lt's Tony!
He's come for his bride.
l'm sorry.
l can't marry you.
l'll be leaving soon.
l'm only a substitute teacher.
Well, then who will we marry?
Guess who?
l never thought Tony might leave us.
You never think when you're in love.
lt seems Ms. Simpson took a turn for the worse, she didn't show up today.
So we had to come up with a plan.
Her name is Vicki.
She's an actress.
Where's my money?
A professional actress.
You might remember her as the third pepperoni on the dancing pizza commercial.
l love your work.
Here's the money.
All of the guys in Mr. Crane's classes chipped in.
Thank you.
Okay, Vicki, now the bell's going to ring any minute.
The most handsome hunk you've ever seen is going to come walking around that corner.
You just stop him in the hall and play the scene we rehearsed.
Got it.
Now don't let him get away, because the girls are going to be coming from gym class and they have to see you and him together.
- l understand.
- And you remember your cue?
When you guys say hello and wave to him, l come running into the hallway.
- Right.
-  Hello, boys.
- Hello!
- Both: No!
Darling, there you are.
Oh, my love.
l could not wait until June.
l took the first plane in from Rome.
Let's get married today.
June?
Rome?
Married?
Excuse me, but boy have you got the wrong man.
The wrong man?
Darling, don't joke with me.
How could there be two men as beautiful as are you?
l know it's hard to believe.
But it must be true.
Please, l can't wait another day to become Mrs. Tony Crane.
Tony Crane?
Mr. Crane, do you have an explanation for this?
Oh no.
l got the wrong guy?
That's right.
The wrong guy.
l should have known this wasn't the handsome hunk.
All right, everybody get where you were going before l start handing out detention.
Go, go, go!
Mr. Crane, do you have an explanation for this?
lf you give me a few minutes Mr. Belding, l think l will.
Fine.
l'll meet you in my office.
Well, if you ever need an actress, call me.
Gotta run.
Linguini commercial.
Okay, will the occupants of lockers 140, 142 and 144 please come out?
Okay, guys.
What did l do to deserve this performance?
Mr. Crane, ever since you came here, the girls act like we don't exist.
Yeah, they keep on telling us you're this sophisticated man and we're nothing but kids.
So we thought if we could make them think you were engaged, then maybe they'd forget about you and remember us.
Sounded like a good plan.
Yeah, but we should've hired an actress with hallway experience.
You know, guys, l really have no intention of taking your girls from you.
l'm sorry if my coming here has caused you problems, but what do you want me to do, give up teaching?
- Would you?
- No.
But l do understand how you feel.
l just don't think that trying to embarrass me is the solution to your problem.
You're right.
- Okay, we're sorry.
- Yeah.
Okay.
Why don't you go ahead into class?
l gotta smooth this over with Belding.
- All right.
Thanks, Mr. Crane.
- Yeah, thanks.
Just stay away from our mothers.
Mr. Crane!
Sorry we're late, but the field hockey game went into sudden death.
- l scored the winning goal.
- Listen, no problem.
Why don't you just go into class?
l'll be right there.
He touched me!
l told you he liked me best.
Oh, yeah right.
l wonder why Tony wanted to meet us here.
Maybe he couldn't hide his true feelings any longer.
Jessie, you really think he's in love with all three of us?
Well, maybe just one of us.
This is the happiest day of my life.
l want you both to be my bridesmaids.
Hey, not you, me!
You?
lt's me he loves.
When he looked at me during the fire drill, the smoke detectors went off.
Oh, yeah right.
Hey, chill out, ladies.
Look, the biggest moment in one of our lives is about to happen, and we need to be alone.
So do you guys mind leaving?
Well, sorry.
Mr. Crane told us to meet him here after class.
- Why would he want you here?
- He didn't tell us.
How sweet.
Ushers for our wedding.
Could you boys sit over there?
-  - Slater: Boys?
Here he comes!
Right in here, darling.
This is the place where all the kids hang out.
lt's cute.
Here are three of the guys l've been teaching.
Guys, this is Vicki, my fianc√©e.
Pleased to meet you.
Um, same here.
What a coincidence.
She really is his fianc√©e.
And honey, these are three of the young ladies l've been teaching.
Hello.
Are you in the same grade as those guys?
- Yes.
- Really?
You look so much younger.
Well, l just wanted Vicki to meet some of my students.
Ms. Simpson will be back on Monday, so this was my last day.
''O, that a joy past joy calls out on me, that it were a grief, so brief to part with thee.
'' Goodbye, Mr. Crane!
One, two, three girls!
So what did you think of Mr. Crane's fianc√©e?
She was attractive, if you like that exotic type.
You think so?
l think all three of you are much better looking.
Oh, yeah.
No contest.
Why don't you guys sit down?
Hey, l was going to sit there.
Tough luck, Preppie.
The truce is over.
Hey, Max.
What can l get for you Lisa?
You can get lost.
All right, we're back to normal!

lt's Homecoming Week, and Bayside is getting ready for the big game against Valley.
l don't like to knock our team, but last year their band scored a touchdown against us.
Hey guys, you got anything here for your star quarterback?
Life insurance.
We haven't beaten Valley in 22 years.
23, but who's counting?
Slater, you've got to promise you'll win.
Yeah, l'm sick of hearing Valley's victory cheer.
''We won, l'm sure.
We won, get real.
Valley's the best.
Like forever's the deal.
'' Well, you know, guys, we're gonna, like, totally destroy those Valley dudes, ya know.
And it's gonna be really, really gnarly.
lt'll be gnarly if we sell these tiger tails.
l've got an idea.
lf you attach the hat to the tails, attach the hat to our star quarterback here Well, you have a stroke of marketing genius.
Wait a minute.
l look stupid in this.
Hey, no problem.
We'll just cover the stupid part.
That's a good idea.
Hey guys.
The truth-- - how do l look?
- Full of cheer.
l'm serious.
l want to be Queen.
Well, we'll let you know if anything happens to Princess Di.
l'm talking about Homecoming Queen.
Come on, you're a shoo-in.
Guys bribe teachers just to sit beside you in class.
What if they found out l wear a retainer at night?
How is anyone going to find out you wear a retainer?
Wanna join our retainer club?
Screech, what are you so happy about?
Look at this face.
Tell me what you see.
Proof that there's life on other planets.
No, besides that.
Look closer.
All l see is a big zit.
Yeah, isn't it great?
!
lt's my first.
Say hi to Murray.
l hope Murray and you are very happy together.
What's he doing?
Zit gazing.
How gross.
Lisa, l'm sailing on my voyage to manhood.
- Care to come aboard?
- l'd rather be eaten by a shark.
This is chemistry class, not ''Love Connection.
'' lf you don't finish your experiments, l'll have to experiment with your grades.
Just about finished, Mr. Bennett.
- Right, Screech?
- Uh, right, Screech.
l mean, Mr. Bennet.
Just have to add a dash of that And as we watch, the solution should solidify into Both: A malt for the Homecoming Queen.
- l was first.
- ln your dreams, Preppie.
- Hey, get lost.
- You get-- Guys, l'll drink both of them, thank you.
How do you like my hair?
ls it better up or down?
Give us a break.
Up.
l think it accentuates your high cheekbones and reveals your swan-like neck.
- You really think so?
- Well, l like your hair down.
l think it brings out your mysterious eyes.
Good point.
l'll wear it down.
Hey, what does Slater know about hair?
He styles his hair hanging out of the school bus window.
Yeah, well, Preppie here had to kill three moose to get his hair like that.
- Yeah, well - Well, what?
Hi, guys.
Hey look, Suzie dyed her hair.
Wow, she looks great.
Yeah, but not as good as Muffin looks in that mini-skirt.
Slater: Yeah, she does.
lf you two stare any harder, your eyes are gonna pop out like Slinkys.
Hey Kelly, aren't Suzie and Muffin the other finalists for Homecoming Queen?
How would l know?
You've got nothing to worry about.
Next to you, they're puppy chow.
Yeah, l wouldn't give those two bow-wows a second look.
Nah.
Zack, quick, you've got to help me.
My worst nightmare has come true.
You found out Alf was a puppet?
He is?
Worse than that!
My pimples disappeared.
Murray's gone.
You're right.
Murray's history.
Zack, you've got to help me.
- l'm just a boy again.
- Screech, it's normal.
Pimples go away by themselves all the time.
ln two hours?
Well, maybe fast food gives you fast pimples.
Did you wash your face today?
Why would l do that during the week?
Did you put anything else on your face today?
Only my chemistry experiment.
Screech, we might've stumbled upon the invention of a century-- a blemish cream that really works.
Hey, kids everywhere would pay a fortune.
- Adults, too.
- Yeah.
lt could work wonders for Gorbachev.
lt's sort of like an acne Glasnost.
Hey, but we gotta put the cream to a test.
We gotta find a kid with just the right skin.
Both: ''Crater-face'' Coburn.
- Let's go find him.
- Let's go get him.
Aren't you done yet?
Hey, l can't go any faster, Crater-face.
You've got too many speed bumps.
Do you really think this stuff will work?
- Worked on me.
- No it didn't.
You're still here.
Hey, hey, hey, come on, guys, quit it.
All right, Charlie.
You're done.
All right, now what about my 10 bucks?
Oh yeah.
Here you go.
Hey, wait a minute.
Jason Bateman's not on a $10 bill.
Oh, you noticed.
Cash.
What's this?
You get the other half when you come back tomorrow before school.
And not a word to anybody.
Come on, Kelly.
We're gonna be late for school.
l'm not going.
l'm never coming out, ever.
Kelly, it's just a pimple.
lt's not the end of the world.
That's easy for you to say.
You don't have a lightbulb attached to the end of your nose.
Oh my gosh, Jessie.
lt's George Michael's new video.
- He's in bikini briefs.
- l love George Michael.
But this is George Jetson.
Creeps.
Now can we go?
l'm not going to school with this thing on the end of my nose.
Let me take a look at it.
Kelly, there's barely anything there.
lt looks like a freckle.
lt may look like a freckle now, but by the end of the day l'll look like Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.
Fine, then you lead the way.
Guys, this is serious.
Today's the Homecoming Parade.
Hear ye, hear ye, your attention please.
The Homecoming finalists have arrived.
Wow.
Quite a headlight you've got there, Kelly.
What happened to Kelly?
She used to be such a pretty girl.
You mean Big Red?
Gee, Slater.
ls that the same girl we used to fight over?
You gotta admit it, Preppie, she can still light up a room.
Don't you guys understand?
l've never won anything before in my life.
Kelly, you're overreacting.
Look, this is my mom's crown from when she won Homecoming Queen.
l want to make her proud of me.
You don't have to win a contest to make your parents proud.
Well, maybe not.
But if l win, l could be in the Kapowski spotlight for once.
With seven kids in the family, it's not often you get to feel special.
Hey, you're not getting any votes staying home.
So, let's go.
But what about my Rudolph nose?
No one is going to notice.
Kelly, want to do something about that unsightly blemish?
Try new ''Zit-Off.
'' Free demonstration by the locker.
l thought you said no one would notice.
No one did notice.
Will you look?
Ladies and gentleman, boys and girls hey, anyone with money.
Well, step right up.
The amazing pimple demonstration is about to begin.
Now, you say you're tired of those unwelcome blemishes?
Well, l've got the product for you-- ''Zit-Off,'' the one-stop shop for all your acne needs.
Cut to the chase, Preppie.
Let's see how it works.
Just simply dab a little ''Zit Off'' on the problem areas, and watch those embarrassing bumps disappear before your very eyes.
Come on, this is a rip-off.
His face is clear to start with.
All: Yeah!
But this is the before, and this is the after.
ls that Crater-face Coburn?
ln the new, smooth aerodynamic model.
No way.
Hey look, Preppie here just hired some look-alike with a good complexion to fool us.
All: Yeah!
Charles, give the man some lD.
Now, just $15 separates you from the complexion you've always dreamed about.
All major credit cards accepted.
Zack: Whoa!
All right, all right.
And how many tubes can l get for you?
l'll take them all.
Sorry, the limit's six.
But l think we can make a special arrangement in your case.
Let's haul your case into my office.
Now!
You know, Zack, l have had it up to here with your antics.
And l'm a tall guy.
Yes, you are, sir.
Hey, l've always looked up to you.
Put a hold on the bootlicking.
- Holding, sir.
- This time you have gone too far, turning Bayside into your own personal blemish bazaar.
Now who's your cohort in crime, here?
Me sir, Crater-face.
Get out of town!
You're kidding.
Chuckle, Charlie.
Wow, it is you, Charlie.
lt is a miracle.
Yes.
But it's a shame that more kids won't have the opportunity for a crater-free life.
Sorry, Morris, but not on my turf.
But we'd set up dispensers next to all the candy machines.
Of course the school will receive half of the proceeds.
No sale.
But we've even name it after you.
We'd call it, ''Beldasil.
'' ''Beldasil.
'' That has a nice ring to it.
Sleep on it, sir.
We'll work out the details in the morning.
No, l think we'll work out the details at 3:30.
See you in detention.
Take ''Babyface'' here with you.
Beldasil.
Zack, l heard Belding came down hard on you.
Well, it was your basic give-and-take conference.
He gave me detention and l took it.
Did he take away all that cream you were selling?
l managed to save a few for an oily day.
Zack, you're a life saver.
Can l have one?
l'll pay any price you ask.
This is the stuff dreams are made of.
But Kelly, your skin is perfect.
lt's not for me, it's for a-- a friend.
Actually, a friend of a friend who swore me to secrecy.
l see.
Tell you what, your ''friend'' sounds pretty desperate.
Just give her this and we'll figure out a way to pay me later.
Thanks, Zack.
l owe you a big one.
- l mean, for my friend.
- Right.
Once Kelly's ''friend'' tries out the cream, she'll be mine forever.
This is turning out to be a pretty decent day after all.
Zack, you've gotta help me!
Screech, what did you do to your face?
- You look like a raspberry pizza.
- lt's the ''Zit-Off.
'' Something must happen when it homogenizes.
Whatever it touches, it turns maroon.
Well, did you try scrubbing it off?
l've even tried running through a car wash.
l think it's cream-burn.
Screech, tell me you're joking.
My whole future is riding on your face.
Fasten your seatbelt, it's going to be a bumpy ride.
Screech, we've got to find Kelly before she tries out that cream.
Would you get your tail out here?
- Come on.
- lt's not easy, Zack.
These stripes are making me dizzy.
How long do l have to keep this mascot outfit on anyway?
Until your face turns back to normal or we're safely in another country.
Zack, that ''Zit-Off'' worked great.
lt dried up my skin in a second.
lt's a miracle.
Zack, you're gonna be famous.
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah, you bet.
Yeah, l'm gonna be famous all right.
''Student attacked by blotchy, maroon mob.
Film at 11 :00.
'' What channel?
l'll stay up and watch.
Zack, you're the best.
The cream worked like a charm.
You mean your ''friend'' used it already?
Okay, no more lies.
There was no friend.
The cream was for me.
l had this thing on the end of my nose and well, it doesn't really matter now, 'cause it's gone, and l have you to thank.
Maybe we can go out this weekend?
See a movie?
Yeah, that'd be great.
Anyplace that's dark.
l'm a dead man, Screech.
By tomorrow morning most of Bayside and the girl of my dreams will have maroon faces.
Maybe no one will notice.
l think that tiger's head is frying your brain.
Why are you still wearing that stupid thing anyway?
You told me to keep it on so no one would see my face.
ln school, not my bedroom.
Like l'm supposed to read between the lines.
Screech, your face-- it's back to normal.
Don't toy with my emotions, Zack.
Under this gruff maroon exterior is a bucket of sensitivity.
No.
Look.
- l'm whole again!
Yahoo!
- This is great.
Hey, that means the maroon-ness is only temporary.
l won't have to join the Peace Corps.
Yes!
But the Homecoming Rally is tomorrow.
What about Kelly?
l'm down, but l'm not out.
l just have to figure out a way to hide Kelly's face for one day.
Zack, what are you doing here?
Kelly, there's something important l have to tell you.
- What is it?
- Oh, Kelly, Kelly, Kelly.
You know when we're in college we're going to laugh about this.
Hey, so why don't we start now?
Zack, what is it?
Well the ''Zit-Off'' removes pimples, then it turns your face maroon, but it's only temporary and a day later it goes away and you're fine.
l knew you'd take it well.
See ya.
Zack.
Are you saying my face is gonna turn maroon?
Not your whole face.
Just where you put the cream.
- Where did you put the cream?
- Well, here, here, and here.
- That's all?
- Then l rubbed it all over.
Boy, that was stupid.
When is this supposed to happen?
- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?
!
How could you do this to me?
Tomorrow they're picking the Homecoming Queen.
Zack, you're a-- you're a-- you're something really, really bad.
l didn't twist your arm to use that cream.
You're the prettiest girl in school.
So what if you're slightly less than perfect for a day or two?
Hey, lately, it seems all you care about is how you look.
Zack, l can't believe you just said that.
Pretend it was Slater.
Zack, you've turned my face maroon.
You've ruined my chances of becoming Homecoming Queen.
l want you out of my room and out of my life, now!
- Are we still on for the weekend?
- Out!
And now for a word from our captain.
Thanks.
Well, guys, all l've got to say is this-- surf's up, Valley, 'cause the Tigers are on the prowl!
Yeah!
We're gonna maul you!
Yeah!
Like, for sure.
Okay, we've just tallied the votes for Homecoming Queen.
Second runner-up is Muffin Sangria!
And first runner-up Susie Van Feyk!
And now for our Homecoming Queen, the girl who has school spirit written all over her face, Kelly Kapowski!
Hi.
Thanks everybody, for making me your Queen, even though l look like this.
Well, how about a little Bayside cheer?
Check this out, we've got something to say About the tigers from Bayside, gonna rule the day So clap your hands, and stomp your feet Hey, we got school spirit, we can't be beat.
All: Beat, ba-beat, ba-buh-buh-buh-beat, beat Beat, ba-beat, ba-buh-buh-buh beat, go Bayside!
Beat, ba-beat, ba-buh-buh-buh-beat, beat Beat, ba-beat, ba-buh-buh-buh beat, go Bayside!
Beat, ba-beat, ba-buh-buh-buh-beat, beat Beat, ba-beat, ba-buh-buh-buh beat, go Bayside!
Beat, ba-beat, ba-buh-buh-buh-beat, beat Beat, ba-beat, ba-buh-buh-buh beat, go Bayside!
Beat, ba-beat, ba-buh-buh-buh-beat, beat Beat, ba-beat, ba-buh-buh-buh beat, go Bayside!
Go Bayside!
Yeah!
Zack, Zack, Zack, l got to hand it to you, having the students paint their faces to show school spirit was, well, it takes my b-b-b-breath away.
Sure you don't want to join us, sir, and paint your face maroon?
l'm with you in spirit, Zack.
But l am the principal and l think that for me it would be just a little rash.
Zack, l want to apologize.
You were right about me.
l got so wrapped up in becoming Homecoming Queen, l became a royal pain.
Thanks for helping me win.
Hey, a little Bayside war paint goes a long way.
Thanks.
Oh, since you won't be around to see the rest of the game, l'll tell you what happened.
Valley was so terrified at the sight of all those maroon faces, that they fumbled the opening kickoff and Slater scored the only touchdown.
The Tigers won seven to nothing.
Go B-b-b-Bayside!
Whoo!

When l wake up in the morning and the alarm gives out a warning l don't think l'll ever make it on time By the time l grab my books and l give myself a look l'm at the corner just in time to see the bus fly by lt's all right 'Cause l'm saved by the bell lf the teacher pops a test, l know l'm in a mess And my dog ate all my homework last night Ridin' low on my chair, she won't know that l'm there lf l can hand it in tomorrow it'll be all right lt's all right 'Cause l'm saved by the bell lt's all right, 'cause l'm saved by the-- lt's all right, 'cause l'm saved by the-- lt's all right, 'cause l'm saved by the bell.
lt's Career Week at school, and everybody's excited.
l'm not.
lt's the first sign our parents aren't gonna support us forever.
l didn't know you wanted a career in medicine.
Why not?
l'm sick of school.
Zack, do you really want to become a doctor?
Well, Kelly, what l'm looking for is the most amount of money for the least amount of work.
''Jack in the Box'' already has a clown.
Very funny.
Actually, Kelly, l want to be a game show host.
All you have to do is brush your teeth and smile.
That's all we need, a male Vanna White.
l'm kind of thinking about being a housewife, or an actress.
Do you think l'd be a good actress, Zack?
Oh, fantastic.
Every night you star in my dreams.
- Hey, Screech, what are you doing?
- Moonwalking.
l want to be an astronaut and go into space.
Be sure to get a one-way ticket.
Hey, Slater, what career table are you interested in?
Hey, right now the only thing l'm interested in is my wrestling match against Valley on Friday.
Well, Slater, you really ought to think about your future.
Good idea.
After practice, let's go to the beach.
No women!
The man is in training.
He's wrestling Marvin Nedick, Valley's undefeated champion.
What's with you, Preppie?
Why are you so interested in helping me?
Time out!
What our contestants don't know is that every year l've bet against Nedick and every year l've lost.
But this year he's going up against Slater.
Now, Don, tell our audience what l expect to win.
Well, Zack, Marvin Nedick's dirt bike, with steel-belted radial tires, molded handgrips, plus a comfort cushion seat and racing stripe.
Retail value?
Over $500, Zack!
Time in!
l don't need your help, Preppie.
l'm gonna flatten Nedick in the first minute.
Time out!
Yahoo!
Hey, you guys, l finally decided what l'm going to be.
Well, welcome to ''Guess Lisa's Career.
'' Let's meet out first contestant.
Jessie, tell us where you're from.
Shut up, Zack.
ls that near San Diego?
l want to be a fashion designer.
Move over, Calvin, it's time for my name to be on everyone's behind.
Good answer, good answer.
Hey, Max, how did you pick your career?
Well, it was a choice between being a magician, or running a restaurant.
How'd you decide?
l was much better at flipping burgers than l was pulling rabbits out of my hat.
See what l mean?
And shall we all try and guess what career Jessie has chosen?
Hey, who are you?
Zack Sajak?
Hopefully.
l want to be a lawyer.
l'll design your briefs.
And now let's hear from the beautiful Kelly Kapowski.
l've changed my mind.
l wanna be a judge so l can lock you up.
Kelly, have you decided what you want to be?
Hey, wait a second, you're in fashion.
l'm the host here.
l still want to be an actress, but l also want to be a mom and have lots of kids.
And one day, l'd like to help you with that.
Why have a litter of Preppies when you can have a bunch of little stud-muffins like me?
You'd have to have a good job to support a big family.
What kind of career are you planning on?
Career?
Well, l-- l-- Hey, the man has a career!
You've heard of Hulk Hogan?
He's ''Slammer Slater!
'' Yeah.
Yeah, that's what l'll be.
l'll be a wrestler.
Well, that's fine for now, Slater, but what are you gonna be when you grow up?
- All: Yeah, Slater.
- Jessie: You gotta decide.
Now let's try and guess what career Slater has chosen.
Jessie: lt's a very crucial decision.
-  - Come in!
Can l see you for a second, Mr. Belding?
Certainly.
Time's up.
l'm just kidding.
What can l do for you?
Sir, l have a problem.
lt's kind of personal but never mind, l can see you're busy.
No, no, no l am never too busy.
Come on in, son.
Consider me a friend.
A compadre.
One righteous dude.
Okay.
Mr. Belding you see, l'm having a problem choosing a career.
Did you know what you wanted to be when you were a kid?
There were times when l wanted to be a test pilot, or a race car driver, or stuntman.
But they didn't offer the same sense of risk and adventure as school administration.
l can understand that.
You know, in high school l did have visions of becoming a professional basketball player.
What stopped you?
Sister Agnes.
She kept blocking my lay-ups.
Besides, can you imagine me dribbling down the court at 50, with my belly hanging out and my love handles tripping the referee?
My gosh, l would have looked foolish in that uniform.
l remember the time when l was in high school l cut down the court to my right, they fed me the ball Welcome back to Bayside.
lt's just great to see all you guys again.
You know, there never was a class like yours.
Gotcha, Belding!
That's still great, Max.
And now, the first judge ever to graduate from Bayside-- Judge Jessie Spano.
- We're honored, Your Honor.
- That pleases the court.
Oh, Lisa, l just love your jeans.
- They are fabulous!
- Well, yes.
The name Lisa stands for quality, and l'm behind every pair l sell.
What's that?
Wow, Captain Screech Powers, great space explorer.
Even you achieved your dream.
What is it like in space?
Far out.
Have a Mars bar.
ls there really life on Mars?
Not really, all the good clubs close at 9:00.
And now, Bayside's favorite son, and the most successful game show host ever, Zack Morris.
Thank you, Richard, and hello, Bayside.
Let me introduce my lovely wife, Kelly Morris.
Now, Kelly is gonna present you with a brand new, 19-inch, cable-ready TV!
Well, Kelly, you're a successful model, a former Miss Everything, what else is new?
Now that l'm married to Zack, we have a beautiful home, three kids, two cats, and a dog.
Retail value of home, kids, and pets: $732,000.
Hey, everybody, remember me?
That can't be Slater.
lt is.
He's lost 30 matches in a row.
Honey, he's over the hill.
That's because he never picked a career during Career Week in school.
Wow, he used to be a jock.
Now he's a joke.
And that's how l became the Flo-Jo of principals.
Well, son, l hope l've been of some help.
More than you know, sir.
Hey, picture it, Screech-- we're cruising down the coast, wind in our hair, and chicks just begging us for a ride.
No room, baby.
Maybe next time.
When l win Nedick's dirt bike, this fantasy will become a reality.
What did you bet against Nedick's dirt bike?
- My dirt bike.
- But you don't have one.
What are you gonna do if you lose?
l can't lose.
Nedick's wrestling Slater.
Okay, babes, hop on.
l'm driving.
Screech, what are you doing?
Cruising for chicks.
ln the boys locker room?
Hey, Slater, shouldn't you be at practice?
l heard Nedick's threatening to tie your tongue to your toes, and use you as a hula hoop.
- He said that?
- Mm-hmm.
Who cares about wrestling?
Well, l do.
Your fans do.
l do.
Look, forget about it, Preppie.
You think l wanna end up an overweight, beer-bellied laughingstock?
My mom always said you could be anything you want to be.
l quit wrestling.
What?
You quit wrestling?
- What, are you crazy?
- No.
l'm off the team.
This is bad news.
Not for Slater.
Now you'll be Nedick's hula hoop.
Hey, Zack, here's your fries and hot dog.
l'd rather have a guard dog with fangs.
lf Slater doesn't wrestle on Friday, l'm dead meat.
Slater reminds me a lot of my dad.
What, your father's a 15-year-old wrestler?
No, a 50-year-old taxi driver.
One day he decided to give it up, and stay at home.
So my mom put an apron on him, showed him the kitchen.
By dinnertime, his meter was running.
lnteresting.
Hello, Major Slater?
This is AC's guidance counselor at Bayside.
My name?
Mr. Footer, Frank Footer.
l'd like to talk to you about your son, AC.
He has a lot of free time on his hands since he quit wrestling, and l think he should join So, champ, how you keeping busy these days?
What's it to you?
l figured that without wrestling, you have a lot of free time on your hands.
l hope you've found a constructive way to fill it.
You know, my dad said the same thing.
You're kidding.
l'm sure whatever advice he gave you it's worth following.
lt wasn't advice, it was an order.
Then you'd probably get in a lot of trouble if you didn't listen.
Yeah, probably.
He wants me to find an after-school activity to replace wrestling.
And suddenly girl watching doesn't count.
There is one after-school club where you can't help but watch girls.
Yeah?
Yeah, but l don't want to interfere.
Wait a minute.
- Go ahead, l'm listening.
- l don't know, Slater.
lt takes a special kind of guy to be in this club.
Try me.
Think you're man enough for the Cooking Club?
Cooking Club?
What, are you crazy?
That's for girls.
Hi, guys.
Bye, guys.
l'm late for Cooking Club.
So am l. Thanks for the tip, Preppie.
Slater in an apron?
He'll be laughed right back into the gym.
Hey, even l'll make muffins to see that.
Today we're going to make a layer cake with chocolate, vanilla, and lots of gooey fudge.
So put on your aprons before the food starts to fly.
You look pretty in pink, Preppie.
Thanks for noticing.
You'll all find recipes on your counter.
Step one: throw them away!
Because l like to cook the way l feel, and l feel good.
Da-da, da, da-dah Take two eggs, da-da, da, da-dah - And mix them around - All: Da, da-da, dah Take some butter, don't drop it on the ground All: Da-da, da, da-dah - Put in some milk - All: Da-da, da, da-dah - Then add some flour - Da-da, da, da-dah And what you've got is done in an hour - l'm bakin' a cake - All: Whew!
- l'm bakin' a cake - Whew!
l'm bakin' a ca-aa-ke Cake!
All: Whew!
Mine looks good.
Let's see how the rest of yours turned out.
Not bad.
Not terrible.
Ooh, not edible.
Now this takes the cake.
Young man, you are a talent.
Perfect form, perfect consistency.
Mmm!
And it tastes good, too!
Everyone, taste this.
Ooh, not too much.
l'm taking this home.
Slater, l didn't know you were such a great cook.
- Neither did l. - Try some, Zack.
This is terrible.
lt's moist.
lt's light.
lt's delicious.
l'm a hula hoop.
Slater, l can't believe you made this cake.
lt's wonderful.
l am really impressed.
l never knew you were so sensitive.
l love sensitive guys.
Really?
You know, l cried when l cracked that last egg.
Zack: Oh, come on.
Lisa, a bologna sandwich turns me into an emotional dishrag.
Wring it out in the kitchen.
Okay, okay.
So Slater's cake rose to the occasion.
Well, if you can't beat them, bring in someone who can.
Hey, Slater.
Hey, Nedick.
l hear you gave up wrestling to do some baking.
That's right.
And you're lucky.
l'm gonna be a world-class chef.
These hands are gonna be cracking eggs instead of your neck.
Ooh.
l bet you look real sweet in an apron.
- ls that right?
- Hey, tough guy, before you put him down, you should try his cherries jubilee.
l see you've got girls fighting your battles now, Betty Crocker.
Slater isn't gonna stand for that.
Nedick, l'm a lover, not a fighter.
Hey, you're right.
He never left his seat.
To me, you look like a chicken.
Let me tell you something, Bubba, it takes a stronger man not to fight.
So why don't you go back into the mist with the other gorillas?
Ooh.
Morris, we gotta talk.
- Now.
- Now is good.
- So how's school?
- Shut up.
My next thought.
About our little bet, you lose.
- But the match isn't until Friday.
- You might as well forfeit now.
Who's gonna take Slater's place, you?
Look, Slater will be there.
Don't worry.
Who's worried?
Come Friday, l'm gonna be riding something in the dirt-- either your bike, or your face.
Boy, is he stupid.
What's he gonna do, kick-start your face?
Zack, l've always dreamed about going into space, but l didn't want to be launched by Marvin Nedick.
Neither do l. Come on, Screech, you're my last hope.
And when Slater sees you dressed like this, he won't let you wrestle Nedick.
You sure?
Trust me, he'll come flying out and pin Nedick before you can say, ''Hey, that's my arm.
Give it back.
'' And if you're wrong?
Well, we'll call it, ''The Screech Memorial Gymnasium.
'' You'd do that for me?
Wow.
All right, what do you want to show me, Preppie?
Make it quick.
l've got a quiche in the oven.
l just wanted you to see who's gonna wrestle Nedick in your place.
Screech?
Don't worry, Slater, you'll be safe in Cooking Club.
l'll take care of Nedick.
You go hide behind your apron.
Take it on home, Zack.
Come on, Zack, is he really gonna wrestle Nedick?
Yeah.
You just gonna stand there while Screech gets sliced, diced and put on ice?
No.
Actually, l have to check on my quiche.
All: Beat, ba-beat, ba-buh-buh-buh-beat, beat Beat, ba-beat, ba-buh-buh-buh beat, go Bayside!
Beat, ba-beat, ba-buh-buh-buh-beat, beat Beat, ba-beat, ba-buh-buh-buh beat, go Bayside!
- Who are you?
- Screech ''The Body'' Powers.
- What are you doing?
- Trying to intimidate you.
How is it working?
- Where's Slater?
- l killed him.
l wanted first crack at you.
- Out of the way, you little twerp.
- Hey, tough guy.
Here's a hint of what's to come.
Had enough?
- What is Screech doing out there?
- ls he wrestling Nedick?
Oh great, just my luck.
He'll throw Screech in my lap.
Quit now while you're still standing.
- Move aside, shrimp.
- Hey, butthead, your mom's ugly, your dad's ugly, and your dog's ugly.
Hey, my dog is not ugly.
You're right, he's not, compared to you.
Hey, Screech, we've gotta talk.
Not now, Zack.
l've got him right where we want him.
l hope he stays there, because Slater's not coming.
Not coming?
!
Nedick: Hey, shrimp!
l'm taking care of you now.
l'm not waiting for the match to begin.
Neither am l. One, two, three.
Pinned.
l lose.
Congratulations, smooth takedown.
All right, Nedick, hand him over!
Don't talk about his dog.
Now, let's see how you do with someone your own size.
- Bayside.
- Slater, you were terrific.
But l thought you were gonna quit wrestling?
My quiche blew up, and l realized-- hey, l didn't care.
l'm just a kid.
l don't need a career right now.
Yeah, we feel the same way.
We'll worry about it next year.
- What happened?
- l flattened you, wimp.
l finally beat you, Nedick.
Your dirt bike's mine.
l won the bet.
No, Zack, you lose.
Gambling is a no-no, and l am sure you know what that means.
Uh-huh, an all-expense-paid trip to detention here at lovely Bayside, the detention capital of the world.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
When l wake up in the morning and the alarm gives out a warning l don't think l'll ever make it on time By the time l grab my books and l give myself a look l'm at the corner just in time to see the bus fly by lt's all right 'Cause l'm saved by the bell lf the teacher pops a test, l know l'm in a mess And my dog ate all my homework last night Ridin' low on my chair, she won't know that l'm there lf l can hand it in tomorrow it'll be all right lt's all right 'Cause l'm saved by the bell lt's all right, 'cause l'm saved by the-- lt's all right, 'cause l'm saved by the-- lt's all right, 'cause l'm saved by the bell.
l like school.
lt's a good way to kill time between weekends.
lt gives me five days to plan my Saturday night.
l did it!
l was KBLA's 25th caller.
l won two tickets to go see George Michael.
Kelly, that's great.
Who are you going to take?
Allow me to recommend Zack Morris.
He's cute, warm and affectionate.
And so's a cocker spaniel.
lf you want a date, Kelly, take me.
Well, l'd love to take both of you, but l need some time to decide.
- Sounds fair.
- Time's up.
What's your answer?
- Zack.
- See?
She's going with me.
Too bad, Slater.
l'll let you guys know.
Screech, in honor of your 37th consecutive A+, You get to wear the Mertz Molecule Hat.
- lt's a good way to get girls.
- Thanks, Dr. Mertz.
Don't let it go to your head.
''Bzz--bbb!
'' - l won't, sir.
- Good.
And now l have the pleasure of passing out last week's test results.
Slater, here you go.
Right.
Hey, a B-!
That's decent.
Decent?
lf NASA scientists got B-'s, the space shuttle wouldn't get past Cleveland.
Sorry, Zack.
Copy from someone smarter next week.
That's up to you, sir.
You assign the seats.
Kelly?
Ooh, l'm really sorry.
An F?
Did l really deserve an F?
No, but they don't allow us to give M's.
My parents are going to kill me.
Remember, there's one more test on Friday, and that counts for half your final grades.
l'll be grounded for life.
No more cheerleading, no more volleyball.
And for sure, no George Michael concert.
There goes my weekend.
Screech, l need to borrow your brain.
No way, Zack.
You still haven't returned my tricycle from kindergarten.
No, l mean l need you to help Kelly get an A on her science test, so she'll take me to the George Michael concert.
l don't have any time, Zack.
lt's mating season on my ant farm.
l'm going to be an uncle.
Now look, Kelly is Lisa's friend, right?
And by helping Kelly, you'll be helping Lisa.
Ah, Lisa!
l'll never pass Mertz's class.
l'm doomed.
Kelly, you have to change your attitude.
She's right, this is not like you.
Will you start thinking positive?
Okay, l'm positive l'm doomed.
Kelly, your troubles are over.
Screech here has agreed to share his wisdom and tutor you.
l will be your Yoda.
And l will be your everything.
And l will be gone.
l could really use your help.
l don't know what to say.
Well, just say, ''After l pass the test, l'm going to take Zack to the George Michael concert.
'' Oh, Zack.
Okay, so when do we start?
Tonight, but it has to be at my place.
l'm not allowed out after ''ALF.
'' Screech?
Hello?
Gosh.
You're electrifying.
Who are you?
Hi.
l'm Kevin, Screech's robot.
Welcome to our world.
Oh, hi, Kelly.
Sorry l'm late.
l was developing pictures in my dark room.
They're for ''Robot lllustrated.
'' l'm hunk of the month.
l see you've met my robot, Kevin.
Screech, he's just like you.
- lt's 'cause l programmed him.
- That's what he thinks.
How fun.
Well, Screech, you've got a great room.
l mean, l've never seen anything like it before.
l guess you've only lived on one planet.
- Now let's get started.
- l brought all my books.
Where do you want to begin?
Let's start with atomic energy.
What do you know about nuclear fission?
Not much.
l always end up losing my bait.
Better put on a pot of cocoa, Kevin.
lt's going to be a long night.
Think of these dolls as cheerleader atoms at a football game.
Alone, they are just separate little voices.
Rah, rah, sis-boom-ba!
But fused together as a pyramid, they are a force.
Oh, so if fusion is forming a cheerleading pyramid, then fission must be When the atoms do the splits.
Thank you, Kevin.
l get it now.
Screech, this is fantastic.
l can't believe you went to all this trouble just for me.
l wanted to show you that science is fun.
Beep.
lt's 9:00 p.m., have you flossed yet?
Sorry, Kelly.
We have to stop.
lt's my bedtime.
l really should be getting home.
Screech, thanks for everything.
l really had a great time.
l did too.
Well - Well - Good night.
Good night.
She's cute.
Well, she's got all the symptoms-- glassy eyes, goofy look.
Mismatched wardrobe.
lt can only mean one thing.
Both: Crush!
Come on, Kelly.
Who are you thinking about?
- ls he cute?
- Well, kind of.
He's real intelligent, got a great sense of humor, and he's really fun to be with.
lf l found someone like that, l'd never let him go.
So give already.
Who is it?
Screech.
Kelly, you're kidding right?
No, l had so much fun studying with Screech in his room last night.
You were in his room?
Didn't the bats bother you?
That is just a rumor.
None of his creatures can fly.
You know, Lisa, you really ought to give Screech a chance.
l'd rather give chickenpox a chance.
Hey, l'm telling you, Screech can be really charming.
He definitely did something to her brain.
He did.
l'm seeing Screech in a completely different way.
The best way is blindfolded.
Screech, you still haven't told me how it went with Kelly last night.
We've been over it already.
Okay, so how many times did my name come up?
None, zero, zilch.
Zippity-doo-da.
All right, all right, but l bet she was thinking about me the whole time.
Screech, all l can think about since last night is the stuff we went over.
- Hi, Kelly.
- l got my book here.
Maybe we can review right now?
- Sure.
- Hi, Kelly.
Let's go to our own table.
lt'll be a lot quieter.
Bye, Kelly.
Don't take it personally, Zack, but Kelly's only got eyes for Screech.
What?
Get out of town.
Here's your usual, Kelly.
Thanks.
Screech, would you like to split this with me?
- Sure.
- No problem.
Service for one is now service for two.
Thank you.
Come on, you guys are crazy.
There's nothing going on between Screech and Kelly.
lt's just a simple tutor/tutee relationship.
You should see what he's doing with your tutee.
l think we've just entered ''The Twilight Zone.
'' Slater, l'm telling you, they were drinking from the same malt.
Their lips were this close.
Kelly and Screech?
Forget it, Preppie.
No sale.
l saw it with my own two eyes.
Screech was being charming.
He was using a spoon.
- Get outta town.
- Oh, you get outta town.
Okay, let's put it to the test.
Hey Kelly, how about a pizza and movie tonight?
Sorry, Slater, l already have dinner plans with ''Screechie.
'' After that, ''Kel-Kel'' and l are going to be studying at my place.
Yeah, probably till late.
Screechie?
Kel-Kel?
Okay, define radioactivity.
Changing stations till you find your favorite song?
Wrong.
l was just joking, Kevin.
Radioactivity is the spontaneous emission of waves or particles from decaying atomic nuclei.
- Very good.
- Excellent, Kel-Kel.
Okay, now that we know what radioactivity is, how about radiation?
Kevin, you didn't order a pizza again, did you?
Don't look at me.
- Hey, Screech.
- Zack, what are you doing here?
Me?
l came by to return Screech's tricycle.
Screech, is that yours?
lt was in kindergarten.
Kelly, what a pleasant surprise.
Preppie, what are you doing here?
l was just about to ask you the same thing.
l got stuck on a little science problem at home.
- What is it?
- Screech, can you explain Einstein's Theory of Relativity?
lt's pretty complicated.
lt could take all night.
- l can wait.
- You guys, we're in the middle of something here.
Do you mind?
Both: Yes.
Sorry.
Why don't we meet tomorrow after school and do guy things?
Bye.
Both: But-- Screech, that was great.
You really took charge.
Science brings out the animal in him.
Now, where were we?
Now, this blender is an atom, and the popcorn are its particles.
lf we were to bombard the atom, the particles would split apart.
l'm not so sure l understand.
Watch.
My finger will bombard this blender and we have radioactivity.
Screech, you're the greatest.
Thanks.
l understand.
l see it now.
You're the best teacher l've ever had.
Preppie, we just lost our girl to a nerd.
Let's keep this a secret.
We've got reputations to protect.
Shh.
Kelly and Screech together!
This is hot!
Kelly and Screech!
Kelly and Screech!
Kelly and Screech!
Kelly and Screech!
Kelly and Screech!
Kelly and Screech?
Something tells me the secret's out.
l remember the first time Screech proposed to me in kindergarten.
l buried his head in the sandbox.
We got out early that day.
Mrs. Gurskey had to call the fire department.
Kelly has no right to steal the one guy l love to reject.
- lt's him!
- Screech can we sit with you?
Well, l guess so, if we can find a table for 18.
Screech-mania is all over Bayside like a bad rash.
You know, l don't get it.
- What do they see in him?
- Slater: You got me.
Kelly's the most popular girl in school.
lf she wore a pizza on her head and called it a hat, there'd be a run on pepperoni.
Screech is the fashion statement?
Scary thought.
Got a date for the prom yet?
Well, l've been asked by the captains of the football team, the basketball team, the debating team, and the class hunk-- nothing to get excited about.
Yeah, l know what you mean.
All the good nerds are taken.
Hello.
Hello!
- Hey, me first.
- Hey, out of my way.
Did your mother ever teach you manners?
Hey, come on, come on.
Way to go, spazzola.
Walk much as a kid?
Oh!
Oh.
Both: Hi, girls!
Oh, girls.
The Bayside stud-muffins are here.
That's us.
Yep, yep, yep.
Hey, do you know anybody who can do this?
Wow, that is so cool.
Can you teach us how to do that?
Maybe later.
Kelly's here.
- Darn.
- Hello, boys.
Kelly, come here.
Come here.
Kelly, you want to come over tonight and look at my lint collection?
No she can't.
She's coming over to look at my ear-wax sculptures.
Sorry, boys, l'm not seeing either one of you anymore.
Nerds are out.
- Well, what's in?
-  The name is Bond-- Screech Bond.
l have a license to love.
- Wow.
- Tough.
There's only one way to outfox a nerd.
You get a bigger nerd.
Are you sure this one is going to work, Preppie?
Trust me, Slater, if Belding thinks Kelly and Screech are getting married, he'll break them up.
Let's hope he doesn't buy them Tupperware.
The aluminum drive was over last week, boys.
You're a little late with those cans.
Cans, sir?
What cans?
Move it.
Moving, sir.
That was supposed to be a secret.
- What is?
- Um, nothing sir.
Yeah, this certainly has nothing to do with Screech and Kelly.
- Shh!
- Boys need l remind you that anything that goes on in my school, concerning my students is principal territory?
He does have a right to know.
But it's not our place to tell.
Well, what does all this stuff have to do with Screech and Kelly anyway?
lt's not like they're getting married or anything.
You didn't hear it from us, sir.
Excuse us, Mr. Belding, but we've got to tie those to the back of the honeymoon 10-speed.
Look, l understand how kids your age might misread a close friendship as something more.
You see the road l'm following here, son?
No, l think you lost me at the on-ramp, sir.
l'm talking about you and Kelly.
l don't think either of you realizes what lies ahead.
Well, sure we do.
Friday's the big day.
Friday?
Do you really think you're ready for something like this?
l'm always ready.
l just hope she is.
Do your parents know?
Of course they do.
She's been at my house every night.
And they have no objections?
No, they're rooting us on.
Well, l have objections.
Screech, you can't elope.
Who are you calling a cantaloupe, you melon head?
l'm sorry, Mr. Belding.
Screech, get a hold of yourself.
Teenage marriage is a very serious step.
What teenage marriage?
Yours and Kelly's.
l'm not getting married.
ls she?
Well then, what's all this about Friday being the big day?
Well, it is.
ln science class.
lt's the final test we've been cramming for all week.
Oh, so all this talk about you and Kelly getting married is just some crazy hoax perpetrated by a couple of detention lifers.
So ends another science soir√©e.
Pick up your tests on the way out, please.
All right, B+, Preppie.
How'd you do?
- l got a C. - Yeah?
Yeah, it says, ''See me after school.
'' l got an A, l got an A!
That means l'm going to pass the course!
Screech, we did it!
No you did it, Kelly.
l only helped.
That means l get to go to the George Michael concert.
- And guess who l'm taking?
- Zack?
- No.
- Slater?
No, l'll give you a hint.
Someone l know who's the smartest guy in science.
Dr. Mertz?
No, silly-- you!
Me?
Why would you want to take me to see George Michael?
- l hate him.
- You do?
Oh.
Well, then where would you like to go celebrate?
How about the lnternational lnsect Expo?
l hear this year they're having a petting zoo.
l don't think so.
Why don't we go play volleyball on the beach?
No, l've had a fear of sand ever since l was in kindergarten.
l guess we don't have a lot in common, do we?
Guess not.
You're beach and sunscreen, l'm ant farms and allergy pills.
Every ice cream cone has its last lick, Kelly, and this one's ours.
l'll never forget how you helped me.
We'll always have science.
Rebound.
So, Kelly, looks like you need a date for the concert after all.
- Pick you up around 7:00?
- Forget it, Preppie.
She's taking me, aren't you, Kelly?
Why don't you guys go?
l really don't feel up to it.
Whoa.
You think she'll be all right?
Oh yeah.
How long could it take to get over Screech?
You're right.
Well, looks like we're going to the concert together.
l'm not going on a date with you.
- Well, then give me your ticket.
- No, give me yours.
Well, these are front row seats.
Pick you up at 7:00?
lf you get me home by 10:00.

Our group project for Economics is to start a business.
We put our heads together this weekend, and all we got was a headache.
Hey gang, got any ideas for a business yet?
- Nothing.
- Nada.
- Zilch.
- The deadline is today.
We're gonna get an F for sure.
Here guys, these are for you.
- Gee, thanks.
- These are nice.
I made these friendship bracelets in Fashion Club.
Did you make one for me?
For you, I'm making a friendship muzzle.
- I'm speechless.
- That's the idea.
Good morning, my future financial wizards.
All: Good morning.
Let's get started.
Let's hear your new business ideas.
Gentlemen.
Mr. Tuttle, like, we're calling our company "Surf and Fold".
You tie this piece of cardboard to your bike, pedal to the beach, and then show them, dude.
You open it up and ride the waves!
You have a comment, Mr. Slater?
If you surf on cardboard, it'll sink!
Bummer.
Don't let the skeptics, the cynics, and the critics talk you out of your dream!
- Radical.
- Here's your $100 seed money.
And may success unfold before you!
Motivated, motivated, motivated Okay, Mr. Poindexter, your group's next.
Okay.
Now as we all know, this is a pocket protector.
It keeps your shirt clean from those yucky pen and pencil smudges.
But it gets dirty itself.
So we plan to revolutionize active wear with a pocket protector protector!
Mr. Poindexter, do you really believe in this product?
- Yes, we do.
- We do.
When do we eat?
Then make it, promote it and sell it!
Here's your seed money.
Plant it and make it grow.
Motivated, motivated, motivated Okay, Miss Spano, what about your group?
Well, Mr. Tuttle, I'm afraid we couldn't agree on anything Until this morning.
- Kelly, give me your hand.
- Zack, what are you doing?
Mr. Tuttle, there's nothing more important in life than your friends.
So what better gift from a friend to a friend than beautiful, handmade friendship bracelets!
Awesome!
The public is never wrong.
Ignore the pouters, the doubters, and the shouters.
Project approved!
- Hey guys, we're in business!
- Slater: All right.
Lisa says she can make 19 bracelets in a day, but she isn't gonna have time to sleep.
So?
If you want to be a success, you have to make sacrifices.
We're gonna need a lot more than 19 a day.
You think so?
You saw the reaction those bracelets got.
We could get rich.
Hey, we wouldn't have to go to school anymore.
We could buy the school.
Fame and fortune, the final frontier.
This is your host, Robin Screech, inviting you to another symphony of success on "Lifestyles of the Rich and Shameless".
We're standing in the building that bracelets bought.
A former school converted to a factory by who would have believed it former student Zack Morris, now the fifth richest man in America.
Fourth.
I just bought Bill Cosby.
Mr. Morris, how many friendship bracelets do you produce here each year?
Well, let's just ask the factory foreman, Robin.
You rang, boss?
Yes.
What was our volume last year, Slater?
Two billion bracelets, boss.
Yeah.
Two billion!
How can you possibly produce so many handwoven articles in a single year?
Zack, I gotta get more sleep!
I know you do, Lisa.
For Christmas I'm giving you a nap.
Thank you.
Mr. Morris, President Bush called.
He wants a friendship bracelet for Gorbachev.
And Vice President Quayle broke his when he tried to put over his head.
Again?
!
That fetching young woman doing Zack's bidding is his childhood chum, Jessie Spano.
Beauty and brains, what a package.
And sir, your chauffeur is here.
Send him in, Miss Spano.
As you can see, Zack Morris has not forgotten the little people.
You're due at your yacht club in 15 minutes, sir.
The limo is waiting to take you to the helicopter.
Ahem.
You know, Robin, this used to be my office.
Who cares?
!
You're not Rich and Shameless.
Well, Robin, I'd love to chat, but I've gotta go live my life of luxury.
Hello, darling.
Let's sail to Hawaii and buy it.
Mmm.
And there he goes, following that red carpet all the way to the top.
Until next time, this is Robin Screech, hoping you all have milkshake wishes and cheeseburger dreams!
Okay, Preppie.
We're here.
Hi, guys.
Thanks for coming over.
This is so exciting!
The hottest idea in school, and we're all in it together!
That's right.
Yeah.
If we're gonna make any money, we're gonna have to mass produce these babies.
My friends in the Fashion Club say they can make 60 a day.
- 80 if we pay them.
- 60's fine.
Now, did anybody come up with a name for our company?
Yeah, I did.
We're selling friendship bracelets, and we're all friends right?
What about "Friendship Forever"?
I love it.
It's so friendly!
Perfect.
Now, the next order of business is picking a vice president.
Well, you came up with the bracelet idea, Zack.
So I really think it should be you.
Me?
What, are you kidding?
I'm president.
Says who?
Yesterday we all agreed Jessie would be the president!
Remember, Zack?
Yeah, but that was when we didn't have anything.
Now we have a million dollar idea.
I don't want Jessie to blow it.
Why would I blow it?
Because you've got to be ruthless, cunning and tough to be president.
Not a sensitive marshmallow like you.
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.
You cried when Kermit and Miss Piggy broke up.
Well, if that's the way you feel, I'll just start my own company!
Yeah, you and who else?
- Me else.
- Me else, too.
You're being unfair.
What does fair have to do with it?
We're talking about business here.
- Coming, Lisa?
- How can I?
The man recognizes my genius.
And I can't leave my best pal and my best gal.
Please, go with them.
Fine, you start your own company and we'll see who outsells who.
You bet we will, bubba.
- There you go.
- Thanks.
All right, take yours.
Thank you.
There you go.
All right.
Well, well, well, if it isn't the three marketeers.
I don't see a booth for your product.
But if you beg me, I might take you back.
I wouldn't beg you to spit if my eyebrows were on fire.
Mr. Morris, how are our friends at Friendship Forever?
Friendly, sir.
So far our net profit is $120!
Magnificent, Mr. Morris.
Miss Spano, I hear you spawned a separate company.
Yes, Mr. Tuttle.
And we'd like to present a video that will introduce our new product to the class.
Slater, if you please?
This ought to be good for a laugh.
I was never good at making friends.
Never could get a date for the dance.
And I tried everything.
I tried everything I could think of.
And then I discovered "Buddy Bands".
And now for only 3.95, my dance card is full.
- Buddy Bands.
- Buddy Bands.
Buddy Bands.
Hey, they work.
You're right, Zack.
What a joke!
Mr. Tuttle, I object!
That's the same product we're selling.
No, it's not.
Yours is a stupid wristband and ours is a clever headband.
There's room for similar products in the marketplace, Mr. Morris.
Look at Pepsi and Coke, Avis and Hertz.
Bologna and whipped cream.
He's got a point, Zack.
Project approved, Miss Spano.
And I commend the three of you on a superlative piece of promotion.
- Thank you, Mr. Tuttle.
- Thank you.
It's gonna play in selected classrooms throughout the week.
And Buddy Bands are on sale as of right now!
How's Friendship Forever going?
Downhill.
We had the market cornered and now we're losing out to a competitor.
Really?
The same thing happened to me when they opened a restaurant down the street.
But I got my customers back by offering them a premium.
Buy two eggs - get the third one free.
- Zack: All right.
Buy three eggs and get a chicken.
You know, a premium's not a bad idea.
Yeah, but what can we offer with a friendship bracelet?
A free friend with every purchase?
Here's your friendship bracelet and here's your friend for an hour.
Okay, Peggy.
It's 5:00.
We're not done yet, friend.
Screech, what's the matter with you?
For the first time in my life, I'm the most popular kid in school and it's killing me!
Zack, you can't ask him to make anymore friends.
Look at him.
You know, you're right, Lisa.
Starting tomorrow, you're the new premium.
Me?
!
Well, hey, there's lots of guys who'd like you for a friend, just don't let it interfere with your work.
That's it, Zack.
I'm outta here and I'm taking the Fashion Club with me.
Screech, would you like to rejoin the human race?
You always said I wasn't a member.
I'll sneak you in.
Hey, Screech, where are you going?
You're my friend.
Sorry, Zack.
Being your friend is too exhausting.
Here.
We should have walked out on Zack when you did.
Our company's different.
I may be President, but everyone has equal say.
- Right.
- We're like one big happy family.
The girls in Fashion Club can't believe you're gonna pay them.
Zack thought "salary" was some kind of vegetable.
There's our former boss now.
Look, he's pretending to close down his business.
Clever move.
Guys, I don't think he's pretending.
Hey, Preppie, what's the problem?
Labor shortage?
Production slowdown?
Don't tell me Bayside's brilliant business mind turned out to be an airhead!
Hey, I know when I'm licked.
I'll take a Buddy Band, please.
Well, all right!
He's outta there!
Now we've got a lock on the friendship market.
Slater, you and I are gonna buy enough fabric to make 300 more Buddy Bands.
- Let's make it 500.
- Jessie: Great!
Lisa, you're gonna get the Fashion Club to crank them out tonight!
Wait a minute.
You want to risk all our profits?
Hey, there's no risk now.
We eliminated our competition.
Wait a minute.
I thought you said everyone had equal say.
What about my opinion?
Lisa, there just isn't time for your opinion!
I want 500 more Buddy Bands by tomorrow morning.
Get your Buddy Bands!
Your forehead's naked without one!
Mr. Belding, I've been looking all over for you.
I should have known you were here buffing those biceps.
You'd be surprised how many whistles this arm gets when I signal for a left turn.
Huh?
Huh?
Now, sir I'd like you to have this Buddy Band as a gift from me.
I thought you were pushing friendship bracelets.
Those are out, sir.
These are in now.
I jumped on the Buddy Bandwagon.
You want to give me a Buddy Band?
Badly.
Look, sir, I know we've had our differences, but having you wear my Buddy Band would mean so much to me.
Zack, this is historic.
We're relating!
Not as principal and student, not as detentioner and detentionee, but as Zack and Richie.
We're having a moment here, brother.
Boy, these things really do work.
Here you go.
Thanks for shopping Buddy Bands.
Who would've ever guessed Buddy Bands would be such a hit?
Hey, fellow Buddy Bander.
Looking good.
I see you and Mr. Belding have the same taste in headgear.
Personally, I wouldn't be caught dead wearing anything the principal would wear.
- I want my money back.
- Why?
Is something wrong?
We'll be glad to refund your money if your Buddy Band's defective.
Belding's wearing one.
You can't get more defective than that.
Here we go, 500 more Buddy Bands.
This should last for at least an hour.
Was it something I said?
It's all my fault!
It's all my fault!
Why is it your fault?
Because was afraid to blame greedy Miss Jessie.
She's bigger than I am.
Well, he's right, you know.
You and Slater wanted to crush Zack so much you got greedy.
- Come on, give me a break.
- You are greedy.
Face it, you guys went overboard.
- Let me tell you something - Let me tell you something.
-  - All right, hold it!
They're right, Jessie.
We tried to beat Zack and we wound up beating ourselves.
Look who's here.
Why aren't you sitting with them?
'Cause they don't like me very much right now.
- I put them out of business.
- Why?
'Cause they put me out of business.
That's too bad.
Can I get you anything?
I don't feel like having anything right now.
How about four friends with a Screech on the side?
Do you have our check, Max?
No, but I think I've got something better.
- All: Whoa!
- Slater: All right, thanks, Max.
Why don't you thank him?
Poor Zack.
He looks so alone.
Are you guys thinking what I'm thinking?
Yeah, let's get more fries.
Screech, I'm talking about Zack.
Zack, let's be friends again.
Really?
You mean you all forgive me?
What does this tell you?
Do you forgive us?
Sure.
I've missed you so much.
My, how you've grown.
I missed you all, too.
Come on, sit down.
I bet Mr. Tuttle will give us all F's tomorrow because our products failed.
Hey, our products didn't fail.
We did.
But who says we have to fail tomorrow?
What are you driving at, Preppie?
This baby was a good idea, and so was this baby.
Now, if we put them together maybe something new can be born.
Sorry, I have to go home.
But why?
My mom wants to be the one to tell me how babies are born.
Next, Mr. Poindexter's company: A final net profit of $270.
- Boy: Whoa!
- Boy #2: All right.
How many pocket protector protectors did you sell?
Well, actually, none.
We used a $100 to buy out Surf and Fold, and we made a bundle selling their surfboards as car visors.
Ingenious, inventive, and just plain smart!
I'm giving your project an A, and put one on my dashboard.
Next, it seems Friendship Forever and Buddy Bands merged and came up with a new product.
Yes, sir, we took friendship one step further and invented Love Cuffs!
You see, it's a new way for guys and girls to say how they feel about each other.
Why do I always get stuck with him?
It's destiny, darling.
We sold just enough to break even, and then gave our inventory to Nerds R Us.
That's us.
We feel that friendship is just a fad, so we're going to market the Buddy Bands as bookstraps.
You gave away your inventory?
The goal of this project was to run a successful business.
- We'd rather be friends.
- I see So we're ready for whatever grade you wanna give us.
But please don't make it too low.
I hyperventilate.
Miss Spano, raise that chin.
If you learned that it was a mistake for a company to be cold, calculating, and cutthroat, if you learned that it's better to be happy, helpful and humane, why then you've learned the best business lesson of all!
You all get an A!
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
When I wake up in the morning and the alarm gives out a warning I don't think I'll ever make it on time By the time I grab my books and I give myself a look I'm at the corner just in time to see the bus fly by It's all right 'Cause I'm saved by the bell If the teacher pops a test, I know I'm in a mess And my dog ate all my homework last night Ridin' low on my chair, she won't know that I'm there If I can hand it in tomorrow it will be all right It's all right 'Cause I'm saved by the bell It's all right, 'cause I'm saved by the It's all right, 'cause I'm saved by the It's all right, 'cause I'm saved by the bell.
This is the greatest day of my school life.
As part of the social science project, I'm marrying Kelly.
It's the first assignment where I can't wait to tackle the homework.
Mr. Belding, what are you doing here?
- I'm here to marry you.
- Well, you're not my type.
Button it, Zack, or you'll be honeymooning in detention.
Buttoned, sir.
Class, your regular teacher, Miss Laurette, eloped last night with the shop teacher.
So I'm taking her place.
- Let's get started.
- Why do I have to marry Screech?
Yeah, and why did Preppie wind up with my Kelly?
Your Kelly?
May I remind you, Slater, that no woman is your possession.
She's right.
Kelly's mine.
Miss Turtle, all the couples were matched alphabetically.
I'm changing my name to Zigowitz.
Couples, your grade will be determined by how well you communicate and handle life's little differences.
Now, do you boys take these girls to be your school wives?
You bet!
I guess.
Wahoo!
That's what Mrs. Belding said when we got married.
- Girls?
- I do.
- I do.
- I don't!
Lisa, it's only five days.
Wahoo.
I now pronounce you school husbands and wives.
Our experiment will conclude Friday night at the Max.
Hope you're still speaking to each other by then.
I think pretend marriage is a great way to learn about life.
I think a pretend honeymoon would be better.
I'll pretend you didn't say that.
What's wrong with it, Mrs. Slater?
Mrs. Slater?
If I really married you, I wouldn't use your last name.
- Whose last name would you use?
- Mine.
This chick's crazy.
I bet you want me to have the kids, too?
If you think you have the stomach for it.
Very funny.
But I would expect you to stay home and take care of them.
Lots of men take care of the kids when the wife works.
The wife works.
Hey, I like that concept.
I stay home and watch "Young and The Restless".
You sound like "The Blond and The Useless".
Good one, darling.
I think humor is very important in keeping a marriage together.
Oh yeah.
Other things are important, too.
Really, Slater?
Well, sure.
Trust, understanding and great legs.
Zack: Yeah.
- You macho pig.
- Oink, oink, baby.
What do you think is the most important thing about a marriage?
That's easy, kissing.
- That's terrible.
- Not the way I do it, Peach Cake.
Lisa, a wedding surprise for you.
Wow, is this from you, Max?
Come in.
Screech, what are you doing here?
Don't talk.
Let's go where the music takes us.
It's gonna take you right out the door.
What's with the suitcase?
Now that we're married, I'm moving in.
We are not married.
Take a reality pill.
You're beautiful when you're angry.
Look what you're doing to me!
Yeah, you do strange things to me, too.
Where do you want my white mice?
Inside of a white cat.
Now will you please leave?
Don't fight it.
Tell me how you really feel.
Out!
I forgot to kiss you goodbye.
Dear Lord, thanks for everything you've given me today except of course, for Screech.
Time to get up, darling.
The morning sunrise is no match for you.
Let's work out.
Help!
Someone save me!
Hold me, honey.
I'll protect you.
All right, everyone, now today, we've turned the classroom into a newlywed's apartment.
Our first couple is Mr. And Mrs. Slater.
- Spano-Slater please.
- How modern.
Here's your situation.
You both work and arrive home at dinnertime.
And you're hungry, okay?
Places.
Let's watch, darling.
It can only help us grow together.
- Okay.
- I'm home.
Great, I'm starved.
Me too.
What are you fixing for dinner?
Nothing.
I'm a guy.
Slater!
Well, why don't you just call me what you usually call me?
What's that?
Tiger Man.
Look, Slater, since we both work we should share the household chores.
- Fine.
You cook, I'll eat.
- Zack: Yeah!
Haven't you ever heard of the Women's Movement?
Well, sure.
Put on something cute and move it into the kitchen.
Mr. Belding, he doesn't want a wife, he wants a maid.
Would he settle for a mother-in-law?
Okay, then that's the problem you two will have to work out.
- Thanks.
- Sure.
Now, our next couple is the Morris-Kapowskis.
I'm an old-fashioned girl.
Mrs. Morris will be fine.
Kelly Morris.
Wow.
I've died and gone to heaven.
Now, here is their situation.
A tearful Kelly has wrecked Zack's car.
Belding: Okay.
Zack, I've done something terrible.
Who cares?
Kiss me.
Zack, affection does not solve all problems.
- Solves mine.
- Try again.
Zack, I totaled your new Ferrari.
- I don't know what to say.
- You poor, poor thing.
You're too upset to talk right now.
Very good, Zack.
Let's kiss until you calm down.
Heel, Zack.
I think you should calm down.
Now, for our third couple.
Is it the Turtle-Powers?
It's the Turtles.
I'm taking her name.
Okay, Screech has just lost his job and comes home looking for comfort.
Lisa?
Okay.
Oh, Lisa, Lisa, Lisa.
Lisa no en casa.
I love it when you speak German.
What do you want?
I was fired today.
So?
I don't think I have the strength to go on living.
Okay.
Lisa, your husband needs more support.
Hold me.
As long as I have you, I have the strength to go on.
Is something wrong, Lisa?
Mr. Belding, I can't go on with this.
I'm allergic to Screech.
Darling, I won't leave you while you're ill.
- Let me take care of you.
-  Whoa.
I think you are allergic to him.
I have no choice but to annul this marriage.
Annul?
Does this mean that Lisa and I aren't married anymore?
Afraid so, Screech.
- Screech.
- Screech.
What?
Now, usually, our married couples get a sack of flour to simulate the responsibility of a child.
Believe me, it's the driest baby you'll ever have.
But this year I've changed the rules.
And guess what, they're not babies!
You're getting teenagers!
Why teenagers?
So you can understand why your parents' hair is turning gray.
- Who are they?
- I'm glad you asked.
Behind these two doors are a son and a daughter.
It's kind of like, "Let's Make a Deal".
Zack and Kelly, why don't you pick first?
Daddy!
He's not my son.
There must have been a mix-up at the hospital.
No.
What a hot mommy.
Slater, we're both having this child.
Lisa, our baby.
I'm not a baby.
I'm a young woman.
I want a big allowance, no curfew, and my own phone.
Okay?
You sound just like your mother.
Screech, what are you doing with that toothpaste?
I'm making a symbolic statement.
Lisa has given me the brush.
Come on, Screech, it's not that bad.
Oh, yeah?
I started out the week as a single teenager.
All of a sudden I'm Lisa's husband.
Now I'm Kelly and Zack's kid.
By tomorrow I'll probably be Jessie's dog.
Screech, this is just make-believe.
Ha!
Maybe for you it was.
For me it was the real thing.
My moment in time.
You got a problem with that, dimples?
Screech, what are you doing?
All right, look Screech, come out of there.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
In fact, I think I can help you with Lisa.
Help with Lisa?
I'll be right down.
Screech?
Come on.
Don't worry, I won't hurt you.
Now, what about my woman?
Come here.
Lisa's my daughter now, and my daughter listens to me when it comes to things like what boys she dates.
I thought you said that was all make-believe.
But she needs a good grade, and that's real.
She has to listen to her daddy.
Would you do that for me?
That depends on what you would do for me.
I could teach you how to drink a Slurpie through your nose.
Well, that's a start.
So, dealing with the unexpected is one of the keys to a successful marriage.
Now, Zack, desires a romantic evening alone with Kelly.
- Boy, do I. - I am talking about the assignment.
Kelly has plans of her own.
Okay.
Honey, I'm home.
I have a surprise for you, Zack.
A surprise?
Dad, my bike has a flat tire.
Put a Band-Aid on it.
- What were you saying, honey?
- Zack, he's your child.
- He just wants your attention.
- Attention?
All right.
I'll give him more attention.
Son - get lost.
- Zack?
Mom, Dad's not relating to me.
He's right, Zack.
That's no way to treat your son.
But you're doing a good job, Mom.
Keep it up.
Screech, I'm sorry.
Now let go of Mommy, and go to your room.
No.
- I'm your father.
Go!
- Mom, call 911!
There's nothing to worry about.
Your father loves you.
Don't you, Zack?
Tell him.
I l-love you, Screech.
You're just saying that to get close to Mommy.
I know, Dad.
Mr. Belding, Screech is acting like a jerk.
Well, teenagers are often annoying one minute, and perfect angels the next.
You should know that.
Now, what was the big surprise for me?
I'm gonna have another baby.
Great.
That's all I need is Screech, part two.
Wonderful.
Zack, you are a terrible father.
I don't want to be married to someone who doesn't like children.
Kelly, what are you saying?
- I'm leaving.
- I'm going, too.
I'll send for my ant farm.
This is awful.
If I can't stay married to Kelly, she'll never go out with me.
You know, Jessie, I've been selfish about our marriage.
I'm going to stay home, and raise our little Lisa so that you can be a full-time lawyer.
Well, Slater, I am impressed.
Spare me.
I want to have at least seven kids.
Great, so I'll have to take a number to get into the bathroom.
Seven kids?
Slater, I don't know No, no, no.
It's all right, darling.
I'll give up my career, and take care of them all.
Why?
Because I'm a good father.
Knock, knock, knock.
Mr. Spano-Slater, I've come to take your daughter Lisa to the movies.
How sweet.
Lisa's not home right now, so when you hear the beep, hang up.
Beep.
She's home.
I see her right there.
Well, Screech, I'm sorry, buddy.
I did my best.
Thanks for coming over.
Wait a second.
You promised me a date with Lisa if I broke up Kelly and Zack.
- What?
- What?
- What?
- Ooops!
Kids, you never know what they're going to say.
You have made a mockery out of mock marriage.
- I'm failing all of you.
- Let's be fair about this, sir.
We shouldn't all fail.
Just Screech and Slater.
Why me?
They're fathers, I'm just a kid.
You are all to blame for bringing your personal rivalries into this project.
Slater, why did you try to break up Zack and Kelly's marriage?
Because I wanted to be married to Kelly.
Home wrecker.
You stay away from my mommy.
- She's not your mommy.
- Is that true, Daddy?
I'm not your daddy!
Great!
Now I'm an orphan.
What a week!
Boys, I am very disappointed in all of you.
At least the girls found out about you before it was too late.
You're right, Mr. Belding.
We really acted like jerks.
- We're sorry.
- Yeah.
Will you let us back into the project?
That's really up to the girls, now, isn't it?
Well, if the girls say no, will you be my daddy?
Max, thanks for letting us use your place for our project.
Think of it as another classroom.
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Max.
Your wife and daughter are here, Mr. Slater.
Thank you, Max.
Ladies, you both look dynamite tonight.
Let me help you with this, honey.
It's not necessary, but thank you.
I hope you'll forgive me for promising you to Screech, dear.
All right, I forgive you.
Now, let's eat.
- Can I take your order?
- I'll order for everyone, Max.
Thank you, Slater, but you know I like to order for myself.
I sit corrected.
What's the most expensive thing on the menu, Max?
The most expensive thing on the menu, would have to be the duck.
Do you have anything that's dead?
- How about a Max burger?
- I'll have one with everything.
Three Max Burgers, Max.
Slater, you're ordering for me again.
I can't help it, Jessie.
I think the husband should be the man.
If the husband's a real man, he wouldn't be threatened by a woman who knows what she wants.
You know, Jessie, you're really a great girl, but I think we should break up before I "send you to the moon".
Slater, what about our grade?
Jessie, two people like us should never be married.
- It's the truth, isn't it?
- Yeah, I guess so.
It's like the roadrunner marrying the coyote.
Great!
Does this mean I have to pay for my own burger?
- Good evening.
- Hey.
Thanks, Max.
Thanks for coming.
So, what have you been doing since I've been away?
The usual.
How about you?
Well, I've been sitting in my room watching "Brady Bunch" reruns.
You could always make me laugh, Zack.
It's a shame we don't feel the same way about our family and children.
Maybe that's because I was an only child and wanted all of your attention for myself.
- How's our son, little Screech?
- Talks about you all the time.
Really?
- Thank you.
- Hope you like tonight's special.
It's a little surprise Max cooked up.
So would you consider giving me another chance?
I'd have to think about it.
Hi, Dad.
Son.
How I've missed him.
Daddy, where are you?
It's dark in here.
So what do you say?
Will you take me back?
Give him another chance, Mom.
I need a new bike.
Well, Zack, can you accept the fact that it's hard to be alone when you have children?
I can do it.
I mean, I want to do it.
Yeah, but at times it's nice to be alone, too.
Excuse me, time's up.
- Our project is over.
- Hey, wait.
We're working on extra credit.
Mr. Belding, I'm sorry, Slater and I couldn't make our marriage work.
Jessie, sometimes two people just aren't compatible.
The important thing is that both couples tried to communicate and they succeeded.
I think you all learned a lot about yourselves.
All of you pass.
Good work.
- All right.
Thanks.
- Thank you.
Zack, I have that surprise for you.
You do?
Remember in our project I told you about another child?
- Well, it was a girl.
- A girl.
That's great.
Da-da!

As you can see, school elections are being held this week.
My best friend Jessie Spano is running for student body president.
As for me, I only run for buses, blondes and brunettes.
Hey Jessie, being president is a waste of time.
It's like being a lifeguard for a birdbath.
No, it isn't.
It's an important job.
I care about the student body.
I care about a student body, too hers.
And that's one campaign you're never going to win.
This is important to me.
My mother got involved in the '60s and she made such a difference.
I want to make a contribution too.
So give your old jeans to Goodwill.
Jessie, how long have we been friends?
Ever since toddler group, when you forgot your teddy bear and borrowed my blankie.
Keep Teddy out of this.
The point I'm trying to make is that student government is a joke.
I mean, look at the geeks who run.
- Oh, thanks, Zack.
- Except for you.
What I'm trying to say is, nothing ever gets changed around here.
Zack, if you don't like the way things are, why don't you put your money where your mouth is and run?
Me, run?
That's like asking Roseanne Barr to skip a meal.
Well, well, as Faculty Election Advisor, I'd like to welcome you to the fray, Miss Spano.
Thank you, Mr. Dewey.
Are you joining us in class, Mr. Morris?
I'll be there in a minute, Mr. Dewey.
I just have to go to my locker to get my tape recorder.
I'd hate to miss a single X or Y. You make light of algebra now, but when you're all grown up and your friends are making logarithm jokes at parties, you won't have a clue as to what everybody's laughing at.
Mr. Dewey, good news.
The grant from the Student Government Foundation came through.
Hot dog.
Imagine a free trip to Washington DC.
For the winner of the student body election, the faculty advisor, and most importantly the school principal.
I can't wait.
I'll never forget the last time Mrs. B and I went to Washington.
We got arrested for skinny-dipping in the Potomac.
That's a Kodak moment.
We want this trip to be a surprise for the lucky student who wins.
Then let's go to Washington without him.
A free trip to Washington?
No school for a week?
I think it's time to get involved and give something back.
But I'm still keeping Jessie's blankie.
The filing deadline for the school election is today and we have only one name for president.
Jessie Spano.
Why don't you run too, Lisa?
I wouldn't run against Jessie.
She's my friend.
Besides, I couldn't give up Saturdays.
That's when I get my facial and body wrap.
How about you, Slater?
Oh, I can't, sir.
I'm her body wrapper.
Now is not the time to go to the bathroom.
Sit tight.
I want to run, sir.
- You?
- Zack?
- Morris?
- He's good for America!
- Zack, are you serious?
- Well, yes.
I'm inspired by the words of the Beach Boys, "Be True to Your School".
Your patriotism is giving me "good, good, good vibrations".
Okay, Zack.
What is going on?
Maybe you're right.
Maybe it's time for me to be a good American.
If you were a good American you'd have left the country years ago.
Jessie, I'm running and you can't stop me, okay?
Okay, Zack.
Go ahead and run.
But I'm warning you, I'm going to kick your butt.
Mr. Morris, would you care to rebut?
I'll wipe her out.
That's the spirit.
Let the campaign begin!
And if I'm elected student body president, I promise to uphold our school constitution, and I promise to promote a healthier, more productive environment by removing all products with artificial ingredients from school vending machines.
Thank you.
Woo!
Regarding our school constitution who cares?
And as for artificial ingredients, I think they've gotten a bum rap.
Do you want to live a life without pizza, nachos, or hot dogs?
- No!
- Never!
Ladies and gentlemen, the candidates: Jessie Spano and Zack Morris.
- Nice speech, Jessie.
- Thanks, Max.
I hope I can count on your support.
Thanks, Max.
Max, whose side are you on?
All right!
You can count on me as your right-hand man.
Thanks a lot.
Hey Jessie, can I be your campaign manager?
You?
Lisa, we don't have much in common.
I know you think I'm about as deep as a Frisbee.
But, Jessie, there's a lot more than you realize underneath this adorable exterior.
Gee, I don't know.
Courtney?
Chelsea?
Will you vote for Jessie?
Like, sure.
Like, totally, if you want us to.
Forget Federal Express.
I can deliver.
Looks like I've got a new campaign manager.
Kelly, you want to sign up to work for me?
- Put me down as a maybe.
- Maybe?
What does that mean?
I can't make up my mind between you and Zack without getting all the information and listening to all the speeches.
It wouldn't be fair.
Fair?
!
What does fair have to do with it?
!
We are women!
We go to the bathroom together!
We vote together.
- I can't believe this is you.
- Who cares who it is?
Just vote for me.
Come on I voted for you for cheerleader, didn't I?
That's different.
I'm one piece of a pyramid.
You're going to run the whole school.
It's a big decision.
Oh, women!
Soon, I'll be president and on my way to Washington.
I hate to break it to you, but George Bush beat you to it.
Screech, read my lips The president of the student body gets a free trip to Washington.
It's a secret.
You tell anyone, you get this.
Hey, careful!
My doctor says my skull hasn't fully hardened yet.
Do me a favor and go to your mom's travel agency, and get me some brochures.
Okay.
And Zack, don't worry.
I won't tell my mom what city they're for.
Hey, Slater!
My main man!
Forget it.
I'm voting for Jessie.
Come on, Slater.
We're men.
We go to the bathroom together.
We vote together.
What would the world be like if a woman ran it?
Less violent and color-coordinated?
Either you're with me or you're not.
You know, you're right.
I'm not.
Hey Jessie.
You think Zack's up to something?
He's awake, isn't he?
Sorry, Screech, I didn't see you, man.
You all right?
I hope I didn't hurt you.
"Washington After Dark: Sipping Ale with the Quayles"?
What's all this for?
My name is Screech Powers.
My address is 88 Edgemont Road.
I'd rather die than talk.
Talk about what?
I'm on a secret political mission, and Zack would kill me if I told you these were for him.
Wait a minute.
These are for Zack?
How did you know?
Who squealed?
Why does Zack want travel brochures for Washington?
I can't say.
Now I can.
It just came to me.
Zack somehow found out the winner of the election goes on a trip to Washington.
Let me down.
So that's what he's up to.
You aren't going to ruin Zack's fun are you?
Screech, the fun is about to begin.
Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who's the buffest principal of all?
You are, you stud muffin, you.
Slater, I was, uh, rapping with the mirror.
I see you're working out.
Always, Slater.
Just thought I'd pump a little iron.
My body didn't get like this overnight, you know.
Oh, I'm sure it took days, sir.
It kind of gives you something to shoot for, doesn't it, son?
Sure does.
I just wanted to say, I hope you have a great time in Washington.
- Thank you.
- See ya.
Whoa, whoa, wait a second.
How did you know I was going to Washington?
Well, Zack told me.
I guess he's just lucky that the year he ran is the year there's a free trip.
So that's why he's running.
Mr. Belding, are you saying Zack would run just to get out of school and miss homework so he could party his brains out?
Slater, sweet, innocent man-child.
Zack Morris is like a vacuum cleaner.
He'll suck you in if he can.
But I've got a plan of my own, and I'm going to pull his plug right now.
Nice legs!
Just as soon as I get dressed.
Mr. Dewey?
- Present.
- Mr. Dewey, class is almost over.
Don't be sad, we'll meet again tomorrow.
No, I mean, you know Oh, I forgot.
Zack would like to show a campaign video he has prepared.
Does anyone have any objections?
I object on behalf of the next president of the student body, Jessica Myrtle Spano.
All: Myrtle?
Myrtle's the name of my turtle.
We demand equal time.
You can tell us the name of your turtle later.
Man: America is Zack Morris country.
- Oh, please!
- Shh!
From the very beginning, Zack showed he had much in common with the great leaders of yesterday.
Zack was born a baby, just like Washington, Jefferson, and Lincoln were.
As he grew up, he got taller, exactly as those great leaders had centuries before.
Incredible, but true.
And there's more, much more.
Zack Morris is a man's man, and a ladies' man, a pal to the powerful and kind to the cuddly.
Oh-h!
Yet he always has time for the downtrodden, the poor unfortunates who have been cast out by society.
For all he has done, Zack Morris has been recognized as a leader among leaders.
Thank you.
But please, let's keep the fainting to a minimum.
I want to be your president.
Remember my motto, "Wherever there's trouble, that's where I'll be".
Zack Morris.
Why the heck not?
Oh, come on.
Give us a break.
This is outrageous.
He's making a "mocracy" of "demockery".
Does anyone wish to comment on this video?
At first I was undecided, but now after watching this video full of blatant propaganda, I am now leaning toward Jessica Myrtle.
Could you just please lean to my first name?
Zack, I know you found out about the Washington trip and that's why you're running.
- That's a nasty charge, sir.
- Maybe it is, but the only way you can prove that it isn't true, is by staying in the race now that the Washington trip's been canceled.
Canceled?
Oh yeah, funding fell through.
But we'll have loads of laughs at those after-school and weekend meetings.
We're going to be buddies.
Hey Zack!
The latest poll has you 70%, Jessie 30.
You can't lose!
Way to go, Zack.
Or should I say, President Morris?
I don't want to win, but I'm afraid I can't lose.
One thing's for sure I can't quit.
But wait, there is someone who can beat me in this election.
Who?
Zack "moi".
Jessie, as your campaign manager and your friend, you have got to listen to me.
I am going to tell you this as gently as I can.
You're going down the toilet.
Am I really losing, Kelly?
You are flush city.
Zack's got the nerds, the geeks, the jocks and the party animals.
That's what I call a Rainbow Coalition.
You can count on the Chess Club, the Latin Club and the Future Orthodontists of America.
This is terrible.
What am I going to do?
- You've got to change your image.
- Yeah, you've got to lighten up.
You know, be cool.
Appeal to more of the people.
He's right.
If you don't change your image by tomorrow's debate you're going to go down in history with George McGovern, Walter Mondale and the Cleveland Indians.
All right, I'm desperate.
We've got 12 hours to turn my campaign around.
I will do anything.
Mr. Dewey: Welcome to our presidential debate.
Since Miss Spano is late it would not be a good idea to start with her.
Mr. Morris, you may go first.
Thank you, Mr. Dewey.
I love this school.
I love it so much I propose extending the school day to 12 hours and doing away with holidays and weekends.
And I want to keep the library open 'round the clock, because I intend to ask the teachers to double no make that triple the amount of homework we receive in each course.
And furthermore, I propose that we  Hit it girl!
Now chill out, okay?
Like, I don't know what he said and, like, I don't care.
I just want to know, you know, are you guys in favor of MTV during study hall?
All: Yeah!
Then, like, if I'm elected, we're not gonna study, we're gonna party!
Vote for me, okay?
'Cause then we'll take, like, totally rad field trips to the mall.
And when I'm elected, like, there will be hall passes on demand, for sure.
For sure!
And now, the awesome one, detention will be for teachers instead of students.
Jessie!
Jessie!
Zack, you've got big trouble.
According to my latest poll, your lead's down to a couple of votes!
- Great!
- Not great.
Look at these demographics.
You're still okay with the geeks, the party's over with the party animals, you've still got the nerds with glasses, but the nerds without glasses can't see you at all.
And you're losing your jock support.
Screech, the trip to Washington has been canceled.
I want to lose.
You going to help me?
Yeah, Zack, but it hurts.
I was kind of hoping you'd appoint me First Dweeb.
Screech, you'll always be First Dweeb.
I just got eight guys to switch their votes to Jessie.
How'd you do that?
I promised to go to the movies with them.
How are you going to the movies with eight guys?
It's easy four on each side.
Besides, they're cute.
I love politics.
That was some stunt you pulled during the debate.
I'm impressed.
I'm not.
I never thought I'd stoop so low to win.
Screech says the election's real close.
May come down to whose staff works harder.
Here's a quarter.
Vote for Jessie.
Here's some quarters.
Vote for Jessie.
Zack takes ballet lessons.
Pass it on.
I knew Zack was pro-nerd.
I hope you weren't hurt by that smear campaign against you.
How'd you know about that?
There were rumors flying all around about you.
You're not really Belding's son are you?
Is that what they're saying about me?
Good.
Hey, you guys, you both did great.
Good luck.
- Thank you, Kelly.
- I wanted to vote for both of you, - but I couldn't.
- So who did you vote for?
I didn't think it was fair the way they were slandering Zack.
I know you're not going to like this, Jessie, - but I voted for him.
- You voted for Zack?
How could you do that to me?
How could you do that to me?
I mean How could you do that to her?
- I'm only one vote.
- I don't believe this!
Me neither.
For student body president, these people got the following write-in votes: Jason Bateman, nine; ALF, seven; Gilligan, six; And the Skipper, two.
Now for our two main candidates.
The tension mounts.
Oh, what a feeling.
Jessie Spano, 342 votes.
Zack Morris 343 votes.
I demand a recount.
Jessie, I was only kidding.
I voted for Gilligan.
Congratulations, Zack.
You've earned that trip to Washington.
Trip?
But you said it was canceled.
That was just a test to see if you care more about yourself than the school.
But I was wrong about you, Zack.
You're a better man than I thought.
- Zack?
- Hi.
Can I come in?
You've been coming in that window for the past 10 years.
Well actually, I came by to return something.
What?
Your blankie.
I think I can get along without it now.
So how you doing?
Fine.
By the way, congratulations on your victory.
Thanks.
I'm sorry you lost.
It's okay.
I'm really happy for you.
Jessie, you're crying.
I always cry when I'm happy.
I sob at The Three Stooges.
Being elected president would've meant a lot to you, wouldn't it?
Yeah but it's over now.
Oh, hey, I heard you won a trip to Washington, too.
I hope you enjoy it.
Jessie, I have to tell you something.
I knew about the trip all along.
That's the only reason why I ran against you.
What?
You mean that's all you cared about?
I also cared about getting a week off from school.
Look, I really wanted that trip.
But I want your friendship more.
I'm going to Belding to resign.
Am I hearing what I think I'm hearing?
Yeah.
I want you to be president and go to Washington.
That city needs someone honest.
I'm sorry I hurt you.
Now I feel bad.
Well, here's someone who might help.
Bear-bear!
I mean Teddy.
Still friends?
Forever.

This week is the annual Sweetheart Dance, when a guy gives away his heart.
And guess who I want to give my heart to?
I'll give you a clue.
It ain't him.
Kelly, will you go to the Sweetheart Dance with me?
I think it's time for a heart transplant.
She's going with me.
Who are you kidding, Preppie?
You won't be going to that dance.
He's in big trouble with Belding.
What'd you do, Zack?
He dumped teabags in the swimming pool.
It was my history project.
You never heard of the Boston Tea Party?
Then he erased the blackboards with Mr. Fetterman's toupee.
I think he looks better with white hair.
I'm telling you, Kelly, Preppie's dead meat.
Tomorrow Belding's having a conference with him and his mother.
Hey, don't listen to him, Kelly.
There's nothing going to stop me from going to that dance.
I guess I can wait another day before deciding.
Where are you goin'?
Hey, Kelly, I got the new Bo Revere tape.
I love Bo Revere.
He's my favorite.
Lisa, we're going to the Sweetheart Dance together.
- Over my dead body.
- Love does not give up so easily.
Screech, why don't you find someone else?
Well, at least this Screech is easier to get rid of.
I shall return.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
You know the rules.
No music in the halls.
Mr. Belding, that's Bo Revere's new single.
It's number eight with a bullet.
Too bad the bullet missed him.
What's your idea of good music?
The Beach Boys, "California Girls".
What a coincidence.
Hey, that's my favorite.
Zack, I'm not a straw don't suck up.
We're still meeting tomorrow with my favorite California girl, your mommy.
What a beautiful color, thank you so much.
And for the apple.
Ever since yesterday, I wanted to bring you flowers.
What a lovely bouquet.
Thank you, Jessie.
Oh, my favorite candy, Tommy.
How sweet.
- Here, Miss Wentworth.
- Lovely apple, Zack.
Well, you know the old saying, "An apple a day might get me an A." I think that would take a whole orchard, Zack.
Okay class, today we are going to talk about subliminal advertising.
What's that?
It's advertising that uses hidden messages.
Hidden messages aren't new.
I pass those to girls every day.
And every day we flush them.
All right.
You know that theater owners have used hidden messages by flashing a picture of popcorn in the middle of a movie.
- Does it work?
- Well, let's say that sales really started popping.
Oh, come on.
You think that I would run out and buy something just because of some hidden message?
You all did.
Remember that lovely music tape I played for you yesterday?
It contained hidden messages asking for flowers, candy and apples.
That's ridiculous, Miss Wentworth.
What do you take us for, mindless robots?
Nev never, Screech.
- How do you do that?
- It's simple.
Gather 'round.
Listen closely to the tape I played for you yesterday.
Now you'll only hear the messages when I take out the music and turn up the voice track.
Bring your favorite teacher, Miss Wentworth, apples and candy to eat.
She also loves beautiful flowers.
And if any of you have a handsome single parent, I'm available.
Bring your favorite teacher, Miss Wentworth, apples and candy to eat.
This is amazing!
Does it always work?
It usually is effective for a few hours.
But remember, it doesn't work on everyone.
And there are always minds that get the messages a bit mixed up.
Zack, what if Belding finds out we're giving him a tape with hidden messages?
He's not going to find out.
They're hidden.
Besides, it's my only hope.
I've got to keep Belding away from my mother.
Don't worry, Zack.
She'll never fall for Belding.
She loves your father.
No, you idiot.
Look, if Belding meets my mother I'll be grounded.
All right, is everything set up?
Yep.
"California Girls" tape is in this machine.
I'll record your voice, and then we'll mix them both together.
- So where's the microphone?
- It's hidden!
Ow!
Okay, Screech, get ready to record my voice.
Zack brainwashing Belding, take one.
Zack Morris is a good kid.
- Zack Morris is a great student.
-  Zack Morris is a fine human being.
Zack Morris is the son I never had.
You're Belding's son?
!
I never knew that.
Have you guys seen Screech?
Yeah, I saw him in the cafeteria.
He was making an egg salad sculpture of you.
He has been hounding me to go to the dance with him.
Everywhere I go he's chasing me with that silly heart.
I finally got away from him.
Guess again.
I'm not safe anywhere.
Mr. Belding, I have a present for you.
- Beach Boys, "California Girls".
- I already have that tape.
Not in the new enhanced Dolby version.
Well, thank you, Zack.
My tape is rather old.
- Play it a lot, sir.
- I will.
But you're not off the hook, bub.
See, what did I tell you, Kelly?
Preppie can't go to the dance.
Okay, Slater.
I'll wear your heart.
Oh, come Kelly.
Oh, come on, Kelly.
You can't go with him.
Ahh!
I wish they all could be California girls -  - Come in.
Hello, Zack.
You're late.
Where is your mother?
She is supposed to be here.
My mother?
I told her not to come.
You told your mother not to come?
Yes.
Who cares?
Zack Morris is a good kid.
I was hoping you'd say that, sir.
Now, Zack, this is very serious business.
Mr. Testaverde said that you dumped teabags into the swimming pool.
- Do you believe him, sir?
- Of course not.
Zack Morris is a fine human being.
Now, Zack, your math and science teachers say you're getting D's.
I don't believe that, sir.
Neither do I. Zack Morris is a great student.
Will that be all, sir?
I'll decide when this meeting is over, young man.
There's one other thing I have to say.
There is?
Zack Morris is the son I never had.
Have a good time at the dance.
Here's 10 bucks, son.
Thanks, Dad.
I wish they all could be California girls.
If this works on principals, why can't it work on girls?
Hey, Screech, did you give out the tapes with the hidden messages?
I gave one to every dork, nerd and geek at Bayside to use on their dream girls.
All right.
Let's see how it works.
Hello, Clarissa.
Hi Edgar.
Thanks for that tape.
It's my favorite song.
I knew you'd like it.
Will you go to the dance with me?
Oh Edgar, I'm just thrilled you're not taken.
We're golden.
It works.
I'm not sure, Zack.
Edgar's a pretty cool guy.
He's "All-city" in chess.
Alan Fairbanks!
I have been ignoring you since second grade.
Uh, I know.
Buffy, did you get the tape I sent you?
Yes, let's go steady.
Waitress!
Waitress!
What can I get you, master?
I'm sure you know by now.
Oh Screech, this is great!
Kelly and Lisa are going to be ours forever.
I don't know.
What if Wendell and Edgar get there first?
We're sending them tapes about us, you simp.
All you've got to do is switch our Bo Revere tapes with the ones in Kelly and Lisa's cassette players.
- Got 'em right here.
- All right.
Did you check the one I made for Kelly?
Yep.
Listened to it 10 times.
Zack?
- Yeah?
- Will you go to the dance with me?
Kelly and Lisa: Hi.
You seem lost.
Are you new here?
Uh, yes.
I'm new all over.
I'm Jessie, what's your name?
My name?
Uh Barbara.
Barbara Bush.
Well, Barbara, we'd better change.
You can't play soccer in that.
You need a uniform.
Well, I don't have one.
Don't be upset.
I'll get you one.
What size do you wear?
I don't know.
- You look like a petite.
- Thank you.
I'll be right back.
Jessie: Okay, Barbara, I found one!
Barbara?
Barbara Bush?
What a weird little girl.
Zack, I am so glad I found you.
I have to talk to you.
Oh.
I wonder what it could be?
I don't want to go to the dance with Slater.
What?
Listen, it gets better.
I suddenly realized how much I care for you, Zack.
Please rescue me from this muscle-bound monkey.
Kelly, how can you say that?
You're wearing my heart.
This thing?
Who cares?
Kelly!
Please say you'll go to the dance with me, Zack?
Okay, I'll go with you.
Has anyone seen my Screech?
Screech: I'm in here, my darling.
Come out, my handsome hunk.
Your hunk is here.
I want you to be my sweetheart for the dance.
- Are you sure?
- If you look at anyone else, I'll die.
Don't torture me anymore, my manly mustang.
Okay, I'll go.
At last, he's mine!
Jessie.
Jessie!
Keep listening to tapes, you'll put my jukebox out of business.
I'm sorry, Max, but this is the new Bo Revere tape.
They were all sold out so I had to borrow Kelly's.
I see you're going to the dance with Steve Lawson.
Yeah, but I think I'd have a better time if I went with Zack.
Zack?
He's the kind of boy every girl dreams of.
Great looking, smart and funny.
Yes, that's Zack Morris.
Something crazy's going on here.
Jessie.
Jessie!
Guess what?
Screech said he'd go to the dance with me.
Lisa, are you talking about Screech as in, "Get lost, creep"?
You're just jealous.
Tigerman is a great catch.
Look what I got.
I thought you were going with Slater?
I was until I knew I could go with my Zack.
He's the kind of boy every girl dreams of.
Great looking, smart and funny.
Yes, that's Zack Morris.
What's going on here?
Yeah, we each had dates, now we're fighting over Zack?
Something weird's going on here, like Bayside's been brainwashed.
You think someone's been playing with our minds?
Wait a second.
Miss Wentworth's class?
Subliminal advertising?
I wonder if someone's using hidden messages on us.
Not my Screechie?
!
He's the buffest bronco on earth.
Wait a second, what am I saying?
Zack!
I bet he did it with this Bo Revere tape.
But how?
The tapes were never out of our hands.
Except during soccer practice.
Hold on, there was this strange little girl in the locker room.
Yeah, we saw her.
Just think about it, okay.
Take off the glasses And the long hair And the dress You don't have a Barbara, you have a Screech.
And wherever there's a Screech, there's a Zack.
This is war.
Ow!
Zack's voice: Zack Morris is a blond Tom Cruise.
Zack Morris is a 10.
Two fives is more like it.
I'm stuck with a three, with seven left over.
Zack Morris is perfect in every way.
He certainly has a high opinion of himself.
He brainwashed me.
You?
I was so mean to Slater.
I dumped him in front of everyone.
You?
What about me?
I begged Screech to be my sweetheart.
I'm going to be in counseling the rest of my life.
Zack took advantage of my classroom so he could be the most popular boy in school.
- I think you should bust him.
- Oh, no.
Bust the blond Tom Cruise?
Never.
We're going to give him exactly what he wants.
And that concludes our lesson on subliminal advertising.
- Have you found it interesting?
- Oh, yes, Miss Wentworth.
It's changed my whole life.
I'll bet it has.
Now, does anyone have any questions before we move on?
Jessie.
Have governments ever used these techniques to control the thoughts of people?
Well, there have been cases.
Does it ever backfire?
I'm so glad you asked that.
During an election in Italy, the ruling party placed hidden messages in the pizza commercials.
So what happened?
Did they eat the candidate?
No, no, but they rioted and sliced him into twelve equal pieces.
You can never be sure of the effects when you play with people's minds, Zack.
Attention students, this is your principal, Mr. Belding, inviting you to take a break from learning.
All right!
To help make school more enjoyable, we're going to play a hit song every day.
I want to thank Kelly Kapowski for lending us her tape.
Where are you goin'?
Where have you been?
You don't have to tell me Zack, I love you.
You're perfect in every way.
Jessie, what are you saying?
I'm saying Zack Morris is a 10.
Jessie, sit down.
Take me to the dance.
You're everything a girl dreams of.
Is everything all right, Zack?
Oh yes, Miss Wentworth, everything's fine.
- Go to the dance with me, Zack.
- I'm going with Kelly.
- No, you're going with me.
- Keep your hand off him.
He's mine.
- Get your hands off me.
- Girls: Zack!
Zack!
Zack!
Miss Wentworth you've got to help me!
Oh you don't need any help, you blond Tom Cruise.
What, is everybody crazy?
They're crazy about you, "Top Gun".
Girls: Zack!
Zack!
Zack!
Whoa, Jeez.
There you are.
You're so cute I could scream.
I am?
I thought Screech was my Prince of Passion, but it's you, Z-man.
Take your hands off him!
- He is mine.
- Yeah, you tell her.
- Zack!
Zack!
Zack!
- Zack: Kelly!
Kelly!
Wait, Kelly!
Zack!
Zack!
Hey!
All right, just leave him alone!
Slater, am I glad to see you!
Keep them away.
All right, just back off!
Back off.
He's going to the dance with me.
Mr. Belding, you've got to turn this tape off!
Zack, it's radical.
-  - Mr. Belding, you don't understand.
I placed hidden messages in that Bo Revere tape.
Now everybody wants me.
Come on Zack, that's ridiculous.
You don't think that has anyone ever told you, you look like a blond Tom Cruise?
Oh no, not you, too.
There's something I'd like you to have.
Hello, sweetheart.
Zack!
Zack!
Zack!
Please stop loving me!
Isn't that what you wanted, Zack?
I think this Bo Revere tape belongs to you, Zack.
But what about that tape?
There are no hidden messages on this tape, Zack.
I bought it at The Spinning Lizard.
You mean you guys were all in on this?
You got it, you fine human being.
That's right, we all got together to teach you a lesson.
Well, I guess I learned it.
Sorry we had to be so inventive, but some students are just harder to reach.
By the way, "son I never had," you owe me $10.
You can pay me tomorrow when we meet with your mommy.
Crash landing, "Top Gun".
