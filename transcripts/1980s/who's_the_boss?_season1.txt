{START OF EPISODE 1}
- Sure you've got everything, honey?
- I'm sure, Daddy.
Goodbyes are tough, huh?
I thought I noticed a tear in a cockroach's eyes.
I still say you're making a big mistake, Tony.
How could you leave New York?
The Triborough Bridge.
Look, Mrs. Rossini, you've gotta admit this neighborhood's falling apart.
Look at Samantha.
When she starts coming home with black eyes it's time for me to get out.
Hey, that's because there were three of those guys, Dad.
And anyway, I got one guy sneezing out of his ear.
How you gonna support yourself, huh?
Oh, hey, Mrs. Rossini, I've got a great job at a great place.
It's all green with picket fences.
But you always said you loved New York.
Yeah, but I love my daughter a lot more.
Mrs. Rossini, take care of yourself, okay?
- You too, Tony.
- Bye-bye.
But I'm telling you, you're gonna miss the heartbeat of the city.
The excitement, the culture.
Hey, shut up down there!
I'm trying to sleep!
Go sit on your hard hat.
Is somebody getting that?
No!
Jonathan, will you please see who's at the door?
All right, I'll see.
- Who is it, sweetheart?
- Oh, just some guy.
Well, what does he want?
How should I know?
He was just standing out there.
You mean you didn't even ask?
No.
You just said to see who's at the door.
You didn't say open it.
Jonathan, I'm warning you.
Joan Crawford is my idoI.
- Morning.
- May I help you?
If you're Angela Bower, I'm here to help you.
- I beg your pardon?
- I'm Tony Micelli.
Here about the job.
Oh, I'm sorry.
There must be a mistake.
This job is for a housekeeper.
That's me, Mr. Goodmop.
Well, my mother's screening everyone.
Did you meet her?
Yeah, yesterday.
She gave me the once-over kicked me in the tires, put me up on a rack.
She should have checked under your hood because you're the wrong sex.
She said that wouldn't be any problem.
My mother didn't think World War II was a problem.
Oh, that must be Jonathan.
Cute kid.
Yes, he is.
- You must be Jonathan.
- That's right.
How'd you know?
Your grandmother told me.
You're king of the reptiles?
- That's me!
- Hey!
I'm in a rush.
I've gotta get Jonathan to schooI and catch a train.
- Well, I could take him.
- No, no- Jonathan, I told you to take the snake out.
Not today, you didn't.
- Must you be so literaI?
- Yes.
Jonathan, I don't know what to do with you.
Jonathan, why don't you hustle your little buddy upstairs?
What's the big deaI?
Well, the big deaI is it's a showdown between your snake and your mother.
Remember, the snake doesn't pay your allowance.
Good point.
Well, sorry, Wilbur, but money talks, and you don't.
Thank you.
Where were we?
Oh, yes.
You were at the door, I was about to close it.
Wait.
Wait a minute.
I gave up my apartment.
Your mother said I had this job except for a small formality.
- What formality?
- You saying yes.
No.
Can we talk?
Well - Do you have any references?
- No.
- Do you have any experience?
- None.
How many jobs have you had as a housekeeper?
One, if I get this.
Mr. Micelli, here you are.
And right on time.
What a reliable person.
So how are things going with you two?
In the direction of the door.
The door?
Angela, what is the problem?
The problem is, Mother, you sent me a man for a housekeeper.
Don't be sexist.
A man can do meaningless, unproductive work just as well as a woman.
Mother, mother, the housekeeper's room is very close to mine.
Oh, hey, don't worry about me.
I keep a can of mace by my bed.
He's got a sense of humour.
A regular Henny Youngman.
What a zany guy.
Nevertheless, it doesn't look or feeI right for a man to be living here alone.
But he's not alone.
- Didn't you tell her about Samantha?
- You're married?
Oh, no, no.
Sam's my daughter.
You're gonna love her.
She's in the truck.
I'll go get her.
No!
No, wait!
- Isn't he perfect?
- No.
He loves children, Angela, and children love him.
I got that from the director of the Brooklyn Y. See, my instincts tell me this is the man for my grandson and it doesn't hurt that he's a hunk.
Mother I'm not looking for a hunk for a housekeeper.
Why not?
He'll do floors, he'll lift furniture.
Can I come over when he lifts?
Mother, I don't know anything about this man.
Angela, I checked him out thoroughly and it's a story you won't believe.
- Oh, one of those.
- I got it from his parish priest.
See, he's an ex-jock, and he played in the major leagues for a while untiI he got hurt and then they dumped him.
Swine.
And it was just about that time that his young wife died.
Mother, don't do this to me.
They were childhood sweethearts, Angela and since that time, well, he's been working at odd jobs.
You know, a young widower trying to find himself and support his little girI.
You did it to me.
Angela, even the child psychologist said that Jonathan has to have a male role modeI.
And this Tony, is he male or is he male?
I mean, we are talking mucho macho here.
Well, here she is.
This is Samantha.
Oh, she got that shiner stealing third in Little League.
Sam, I want you to meet some nice people.
- This is Mona Robinson.
- Nice to meet you.
And this is Angela Bower.
Oh, I'm very pleased to meet you, Miss Bower.
You have a lovely home, and you're so pretty.
Oh, thank you.
I'm very flattered.
That's the idea.
Oh, and this is the snakekeeper, Jonathan.
Jonathan, this is Sam.
- Hi.
- Hi.
They love each other already.
So shall we wrap this thing up?
Gee, I don't know.
Angela, Albert Schweitzer is dead.
This is the next best thing.
Hey, look, all I can say is I really need the job and my daughter needs a good place to grow up.
And, I've got a feeling maybe you need us.
It's okay with me, Mom.
There you go.
There's the deciding vote.
I guess we could give it a try.
We got ourselves a new pad!
All right.
- Hey, do I get my own room?
- Yes, you can have the sewing room.
- I'm gonna get our stuff.
It's in the van.
- I think I'll just go watch him unload.
- Are you afraid of snakes?
- Afraid?
I had a boa constrictor when I was a kid.
He'd swallow live mice and once he ate a kid bigger than you.
- Are there any more questions?
- Yes.
Is it too late to change my vote?
Yes.
Yes.
Grant, thank you again.
It was a lovely evening.
You mean you're gonna send a starving man home?
Wouldn't think of it.
I can't believe it.
Oh, sorry.
I can't believe it.
You spend $300 on dinner, and you still come away hungry.
I've had it with nouvelle cuisine.
The waiter had more food on his sleeve than I had on my plate.
- What about your cab driver?
- Oh, let him get his own meaI.
He'll probably do better than we do.
Sit down.
I'll see what we have.
If I may say so, Ms. Vice President you were absolutely charming with those clients tonight.
You may say so, Mr. President.
Your media plan was only brilliant.
So was the way you pretended you'd seen it before.
- We make a great team.
- Yeah.
How about a green salad?
This is potato salad.
It's true, but it is green.
Sorry.
Haven't shopped since the last housekeeper quit.
I'd settle for peanut butter and jelly.
Now, that I can handle.
I may not be great in the kitchen, but I make up for it in the boardroom.
I'm not bored.
The Connecticut klutz strikes again.
- Here, let me help.
- Sorry.
Don't touch it.
You'll cut yourself.
Here, let me get the dustpan.
This is good china.
I know.
I care enough to break the very best.
I have a wonderfuI idea.
We can't.
My son's upstairs.
I don't mean upstairs.
I mean upstate.
I've got a place.
We can go there this weekend.
This weekend?
I don't know if my mother can take Jonathan this weekend.
I have a cabinet full of Wedgewood china.
We can break it all.
Wedgewood?
Oh, Grant now you're really getting to me.
Hey, hey, hey!
What's going on here?
Tony, no, don't!
He's my date!
He's your date?
I thought you were getting attacked.
What are you doing rolling around on the floor?
We weren't rolling on the floor.
We were picking up a broken plate.
- Both of you?
- It was a big plate.
Angela, who is this?
Well, Grant, you're not gonna believe this but this is my new housekeeper.
Housekeeper?
Angela, this is the ugliest woman I've ever seen.
- Hey, hey, hey, who is this bozo?
- Tony, this " bozo" is my boss.
It's your boss?
I thought they chased you around your desk, not your stove.
I don't find that very amusing and I don't have to explain my behaviour to a male Mary Poppins.
Mary Poppins?
You're lucky I liked that movie, or I'd take care of you.
Grant, behave yourself!
Don't tell me to behave myself.
Talk to Conan the Barbarian here.
- Now that movie I hated.
- Don't.
That's enough!
- Tony, go to your room.
- Angela!
- Go to your room.
- I don't wanna go.
- Grant, go to your cab.
- Angela!
Grant, go to your cab.
- Tony, go to your room!
- I'm going, I'm going.
Grant, I'm very sorry about this.
We'll talk about the weekend at the office tomorrow.
Look on the bright side, you just saved a fortune in cab fare.
Great, that makes two meters that got turned off early.
Bye, Grant.
I knew it.
I knew this wasn't going to work out.
Hey, no problem.
We just got our signals crossed.
I'll cross your signaI.
You have just intruded on a personaI moment with someone I like a lot.
From now on, if you feeI tempted to butt in, please butt out!
Next time I see somebody crawling on you on the floor I'll know that's how you entertain friends.
I think we'd better continue this discussion in the morning.
Right now, I am so angry I could strangle you.
- Let's go to bed.
- Right.
Did you have a bad dream, sweetie?
No, I didn't even get to sleep.
It's you.
I thought it was Jonathan.
Well, don't take this like an apology or anything but I guess I screwed up a little tonight.
Maybe a little.
- I hope I didn't cost you your job.
- No, I don't think so but you might have cost me a big promotion.
So that's why you're going out with that guy, for a promotion?
You're jumping to conclusions again.
I am going out with him because he's great-looking, he's fun to be with, and he's a good dancer.
So he's got twinkle toes.
What's the promotion?
Grant's moving up to chairman of the board and he's going to recommend a new president and I've got a good shot at it.
At least I did.
No problem.
You can be president someplace else.
- Just like that, huh?
- Yeah, like that.
Go down to the president's hiring hall and hang around till something breaks.
You're a smart lady.
You can do it.
You don't need that stiff.
Tony, do you know how long I've worked for this?
Ever since my husband left me Well, anyhow, it's just taken me a long time to get this far - and I'd really love to go all the way.
- Yeah, I know, I saw Nothing was going to happen here.
Why should it, when the man has a perfectly good house upstate?
So that's where you're going with him.
Tony, I'm gonna say this very slowly.
My weekend has nothing to do with my promotion.
You'll never know unless you don't go.
Who are you anyway, Jiminy Cricket?
I'm just trying to tell you, Angela, you can do this on your own.
- It's like Sinatra said.
- Sinatra?
"Through it all, when there was doubt " I ate it up, and I spit it out.
" I faced them all, and I stood tall and I did it my way.
" We're talking about my life and you're giving me philosophy from the Sands hoteI?
Could you just try to remember what I said?
If I had a lobotomy I would remember that.
Good, because let me tell you one thing.
You'd never catch me doing something dumb like sleeping with my employer.
All right, egg fans, let's show those chickens they have not laid in vain.
- I'll have mine scrambled.
- All right, two scrambled working.
Do I hear fried, boiled, basted, or sunny-side up?
Jonathan, how would you like your eggs?
In the shell.
I hate eggs!
I'll just have some Crunchy Crawlers and a cup of coffee.
Crunchy Crawlers and a cup of coffee?
You wanna top it off with a shot of vodka?
Let me see that.
Look at this.
It's all bleached flour and sugar.
You eat this, you'll be a walking pimple.
Out it goes.
Hey!
I always have that for breakfast!
Yeah, well, start eating eggs.
Share these scrambled.
Here you go, dear.
You're welcome.
And you.
Mangia.
Yuck.
Isn't there anything else?
Yeah.
Hunger.
Now, eat those eggs, or the rest of those teeth are gonna fall out and they're not gonna come back.
Oh, look who's up.
The lady of the house.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Can I make you something for breakfast?
No, just juice and coffee.
- You sure?
- I'm sure.
Hey, what about her teeth?
Jonathan!
Since when did you start eating eggs?
Since Tony threw away my Crunchy Crawlers.
He said it was either that or hunger.
You threatened my son?
Yeah, I - It seems to be working.
- Every time.
How are you liking those eggs?
I haven't thrown up yet.
Keep eating, champ.
Later, we'll shoot some hoops.
Excuse me.
So, did you think about it?
Yes, just juice and coffee.
Not just "juice and coffee".
You know what I'm talking about.
Oh, that.
Yeah, so, I'm just going to let what happens happen.
Oh, hey, hey, oh If you just let what happens happen when what you wanted to happen happens you're not gonna know whether it happened or not.
- Just a minute- - No, no, no, wait a minute.
There are things that are no good for you, like Crunchy Crawlers - and guys who want to- - Now, just a minute.
If I want Crunchy Crawlers, then I will have Crunchy Crawlers.
Crunchy Crawlers are empty calories.
Not really satisfying.
In an hour, you're gonna want something else.
Maybe I'll want more Crunchy Crawlers.
I only got eight minutes to get you to the train.
Time really flies when you're bored, doesn't it?
Let's hit the road.
Goodbye, darling.
The schooI bus will be here in a minute.
I love you.
What was that all about?
Sex.
That's what I thought.
Grant leveI with me.
Does my promotion have anything to do with well, our weekend together?
Hey, Jim Peterson's up for it too, and I didn't invite him.
Well, Grant, you know, I think we ought to put the weekend on hold untiI after the board makes its finaI decision.
Why?
Because, to tell you the truth if I go away with you this weekend and then I get the presidency I'll never know if it was because I was good, or because I was good.
I'd know.
You can joke about it if you want to but I'd like to think that I faced them all, and I stood tall, and did it my way.
I don't believe I said that.
I don't either.
Are you moonlighting at a piano bar?
- Hi, Tony.
- Hi.
What are you doing?
This is called aerobic house cleaning.
You stay lean while you clean.
You're home early, aren't you?
Grant decided to call a speciaI meeting of the Board of Directors to decide on the new president right away.
I waited around for a while, then I decided to come home when I started biting nails that belonged to other people.
I don't know why you're worried.
You'll get it.
Well, you never can be sure.
Tony, don't take this as a compliment but I kind of followed your advice and I'm not going away with him this weekend.
Yeah?
That's terrific!
All right!
Well, that's easy for you to say.
If I'm gonna sweat it out, I'd better do it in a sweat suit.
That's a good idea.
Hey, we can shoot some hoops.
- You know: - Oh, great.
Hey, hey, look who's here.
Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer.
How was schooI, guys?
You guys eat lunch together?
- No, I played baseball.
- How about you, Jonathan?
I was in the science lab having lunch with an alligator.
Oh, an alligator, huh?
I like alligators.
You know, they always get a bum rap in those jungle movies, huh?
I'm starved.
I need a shot of granola.
That's a good idea.
A round of granola for the house.
So, tell me all about schooI, honey.
How was it?
It was great, Daddy.
And the playground's beautifuI.
It's so nice to sit on a bench without having to push a wino off.
I'm so glad you like it, sweetheart.
How you getting along with oI' Jonathan?
- You mean Captain Cobra?
- Yeah.
Okay, I guess.
- But I really like his mom.
- Yeah?
Well, she's got it together.
I mean, well, most of it, anyway.
But, Dad, how can a woman make enough money to afford a great house like this?
Well, I mean, she works hard and she's reaI smart.
Hey, you can do the same thing.
- I can?
- Sure.
Then I think I'll be manager of the Mets.
Good choice.
I'll be so proud when you're kicking dirt on umpires.
Wanna shoot some hoops?
- I'd love to.
- All right.
- I'll be right out, sweetheart.
- Okay.
Bower residence.
Tony here.
Oh, hi.
Rosie from the office?
Oh, nice to meet you, Rosie.
She's changing clothes.
Can I take a message?
Come on, Rosie, I won't tell.
She get it or not?
Come on.
Give me a little hint.
Yah who?
Oh, "yahoo"!
Oh, now I get it.
She got it.
Oh, great.
Yeah.
I'll tell her that Mr. Paxton's gonna call.
Okay, fine.
Yeah, Rosie.
Okay, bye- You sound nice too, Rosie.
Bye.
Hey, all right!
Was that the phone?
- Yeah, that was the phone.
- Oh.
- Who was it?
- It was the the Arthur Murray dance studio.
You just won a free dance lesson.
Great.
Now all my problems are solved.
I'll be a Rockette.
You'll be a good one.
- Is there any coffee?
- Sure.
Come on, follow me.
Grab yourself a cup.
Now, there's nothing to do but sit around and go crazy.
- You want some?
- No.
- Let me ask you a question, huh?
- Sure.
Let's say, you know, you don't get this job.
You going to be sorry you didn't fooI around with the boss?
No, I'm glad I did what I did.
You sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.
Why?
Because you got it.
- That- That wasn't Arthur Murray?
- That was Rosie.
- I got it?
- Yeah.
- I got it!
- You got it!
- I got it!
- I'm sorry.
That's great.
We've gotta celebrate.
What should we do?
How about some hoops?
Is that your answer for everything?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Well, mine is a hot bath and a cold glass of champagne.
Well, how about you, Jonathan?
I have to feed Wilbur.
Let's go.
Sam, I think our work is really cut out for us.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Tony, may I see you for a minute?
You rang, madam?
Yes, Tony.
Ever since you've been here, everything is spotless and immaculate.
Dirt is my enemy.
Well, I'm glad to hear that because the enemy has landed in my bedroom.
Oh, you know, I don't wanna Shall we have a look?
Yeah.
Why not, I guess.
Hey, this is nice.
Really nice.
That proves you've never been in here before.
I know.
This is your private chamber.
You are the housekeeper, and this is part of the house.
Now, the private chamber may be mine, but the dust is yours.
I'm sorry.
You want me to come in here and clean, I will.
- I want you to.
I want you to.
- Okay.
And, Tony, same thing goes for my bathroom.
Oh, wait, a bathroom?
Don't you have things in there that are too personaI to mention you know, like, I don't know, false eyelashes?
I'll tell you what.
If you find anything too personaI to mention just clean it and don't mention it.
Come on.
I'm not going in the bathroom.
Well, this is it the land the Tidy BowI forgot.
Gee, what a great tub, eh?
I mean, a walrus could bathe in there.
Oh, no offence.
- Looks like one has.
No offence.
- Hey, it's done.
Forget it.
Hey, headphones, huh?
Yeah, when I take a bath, I love to listen to classicaI music.
That's interesting.
Bathing with Beethoven.
You know, you're really lucky.
I only have a shower.
And sometimes, I love to take bubbles baths.
Really?
You, in a bubble bath?
I always pictured you in the shower.
I mean if I pictured you, I would picture your type in the shower.
I get the picture.
- Now let's talk laundry.
- Oh, wait a minute.
Laundry?
Don't you have your dainties in there?
I am the president of the 12th largest advertising agency in the country.
They expect me to wear clean underwear.
Okay, coach, what do I do?
Well, most of this stuff you can just throw in the machine but these, these silk things and, these stockings, you'll have to wash those by hand.
You don't really want me to wash your skivvies, do you?
Tony, this is all part of the job.
If I were working for you, I'd wash your whatevers.
My whatevers ain't pink.
All right, why don't you show me where to put these little suckers after I finish washing them.
Come with me.
Well these go in this drawer.
- And these go in this drawer.
- I see.
And these go in this drawer.
Now I think you'd better take me to the train.
Hold it.
You know you got this laid out all wrong, don't you?
What's the first thing you put on when you get dressed?
I beg your pardon?
Since you invited me in here, I figure I'll streamline the place a little bit.
Well, if you must know, the first thing that I put on are my underpants.
And then what?
And then my bra, and then my pantyhose.
That's what I thought.
You're doing this all wrong.
You're wasting valuable time.
Look.
First, you gotta come over here to put on your panties then you gotta come over here to put on your bra and then you've gotta chug way back over here to put on your pantyhose.
What were you before you came here, a female impersonator?
Can't you see you're wasting 15 seconds of your life every morning?
I want this place to run like a well-oiled machine.
If you had it your way, I'd be getting dressed on a conveyor belt.
Not a bad idea.
No, no, no, Jonathan.
First, you put on your jacket, then you put on your gloves.
That's not how my mother does it.
All right, gang.
Keep your eyes open for that schooI bus.
I'll be back in six minutes.
That's all right, Sam.
I'll finish that.
Have a good day at schooI.
Bye, Mrs. Bower.
Well, do you remember our multiplication tables?
- What is six times eight?
- Sixty-four.
No, no, sweetheart.
Six times eight is 48.
You keep repeating that to the bus driver.
He's the one who told me it was 64.
I'm sure he meant well.
I love you.
Don't forget, we're going to the parents' meeting tonight.
I won't forget, sweetheart.
Bye-bye.
Parents' meeting?
You didn't tell me about any parents' meeting.
- I brought home the notice.
- You never showed it to me.
Well, I can't think of everything.
Jonathan, come here.
Sweetheart there's a very important board meeting tonight and mommy is the president.
And And so I have to be there.
See, it's like if you had a birthday party, you'd have to be there.
I'm sorry, but I won't be able to be there tonight.
Do you understand?
Okay, I understand.
Are you sure?
Well, thank you, sweetheart.
Thanks.
I'll be the only kid whose mother doesn't care.
Hey, Mona, last of the red-hot co-eds.
Watch out.
Well, you know what they say.
It's never too late to matriculate.
Hey.
- Thanks for fixing my lunch.
- Yeah.
You got it, baby.
- I take care of all my schooI kids.
- I know.
Oh, it is such a joy immersing myself in academia.
I spent hours in the library re-reading my notes on Freud.
What a brilliant mind.
He saw filth in everything.
So do I. Well, I'm going to go have an after-schooI snack.
All that talk about fruitcakes and nuts made me hungry.
- Hi.
- Hi right back.
I hate to bother you, but my car broke down.
Could I use your phone to call the auto club?
Yeah, sure.
Come on.
It's right over here.
I really appreciate it.
What a pretty place.
Did your wife do this herself?
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm not married.
I just work here.
I see.
Yeah, the phone- The phone is over there.
Oh, excuse me.
I'll just get this out of the way.
I got a pot of coffee going.
You want a cup?
No thanks.
I'm fine.
That's for sure.
Do you happen to be Italian?
Yeah.
How'd you know?
- Takes one to know one.
- You're Italian too?
Yeah.
Right down to my Fettuccini Alfredo.
I happen to know this terrific Italian restaurant.
Are you free tonight?
- You don't waste any- - Pick you up at 6:00.
- time, do you?
Hey, by the way, I'm Tony.
I'm Cindy.
It's nice to meet you.
Yeah.
Hey, where're you going?
What about the auto club?
Oh, well, that was just a little white lie so we could get acquainted.
Yeah?
Worked great.
Yeah, it did, didn't it?
Gee, I love when they come to your door.
Hey, Tony.
- Tony, where's the carrot juice?
- We're out of it.
Professor Morrell.
How nice to see you outside of class.
Professor?
Mona.
It's nice to see you.
Do you live here?
No, no.
My daughter does.
Tony's my housekeeper-in-law.
- You work for Mona's daughter?
- Yeah, you know.
She brings home the bacon and I fry it.
That's nice.
Well, looking forward, Tony.
See you in class, Mona.
How do you like that?
A professor.
The closest I ever came to a professor was when I changed buses at Brooklyn College.
And she's not just a professor, she's a Fellow of ClinicaI Psychology.
I'm dating a Fellow?
Hey, wait you have a date with my professor?
- Well, yeah.
- Well, she is just about to grade my mid-term exam.
Put a smile on her face, Tony.
I feeI an A coming on, Mona.
Now, look I want a good grade, but don't hurt yourself.
Oh, wait a minute.
Angela's working.
I'm supposed to sit with the kids.
No problem.
I'll cover for you.
I'll scratch your back, you scratch hers.
I love you.
- Hi, Dad.
- Oh, hey.
Look who's home.
Hey, give me that box.
Ho, give me a kiss.
- How was schooI?
- Great.
Fabulous.
I struck out five and I walked one.
That's great, but what about class?
Oh.
I won the baseball pooI.
See you.
How about you, champ?
How was your day?
Chris Peterson kept picking on me.
Yeah?
Well, why don't you pick back?
- She's tougher than I am.
- Oh.
That looks awfuI.
How can you drink that stuff?
I can't.
It's for you, for your big date.
It's a high potency drink.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
To give you energy and stamina.
It's got protein powder, and some raw eggs and 800 units of Vitamin E. Here, drink up.
Why didn't you just throw an oyster in it?
I did.
Here I am, Jonathan.
Hi, Mom.
- Aren't you surprised to see me?
- No.
You live here.
Sweetheart I cancelled the board meeting, and I cancelled all my dinner plans just so that you and I could go to parents' night together.
Wasn't that nice of me?
I guess so, but I made a mistake.
Parents' night is next week.
Jonathan, I'm going to sell you to the gypsies.
Wow, I like gypsies.
I will not be upset.
I will not explode.
I will go upstairs and drown myself in a hot tub.
Tell Tony I'm home for dinner.
Right, Mom.
I think I'll go up and catch a nice hot shower.
You know, wouldn't a nice hot bath be nice right about now?
Well, why don't you take one?
You know why.
I mean, the only tub is in Angela's bathroom.
Well, what difference does it make?
She won't be home for hours.
Go on.
You know, a hot date deserves a hot bath.
I like this woman.
- You really think she won't mind?
- No.
I'll talk to her about it later.
Mona, I love you.
You're the greatest.
I know.
Holy smoke!
Hey, look.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm- Okay, okay, okay, you're sorry, you're sorry.
- Look, I didn't see anything.
- You saw everything.
- I've got a lousy memory.
- Oh, sure.
I was looking at your headset.
Oh, I'll just bet you were.
By the way, what were you doing coming into my bathroom with your robe and your soap and your rub-a-dub-dub brush?
Well, I was gonna sort of take a bath.
Sort of take a bath?
Gee, I don't have a tub.
AII I have is a shower.
Aw, poor baby.
And where in the Constitution does it guarantee life, liberty, and the pursuit of a bubble bath?
I didn't know you were in there.
Why didn't you lock the door?
Because I'm not used to having people wander into my bathroom.
You're the one who told me to come on in there.
"You're the housekeeper.
This is part of the house.
" Oh.
Are you in the habit of cleaning in your bathrobe?
So I wasn't cleaning.
But I might have been cleaning and if I was cleaning I still would've seen what I saw when I wasn't cleaning.
- What?
- Why didn't you tell me - you were coming home early?
- Is this a new rule around here?
I don't even have enough dinner.
I'm one game hen short.
I'll shorten your game hen.
This was an accident.
Why can't we pretend it never happened?
Well, that's easy for you to say.
You're the person who did the ogling.
I'm the person who got ogled.
Yeah, but, look, nobody knows.
It's just our little secret.
Oh, Angela, so what's the big deaI?
So Tony saw your bare buns.
Oh, wonderfuI, Mother.
WonderfuI.
Now, why don't we just tell everyone in Connecticut?
"Tony saw Angela naked.
" "Tony saw Angela naked.
" "Tony saw Angela naked.
" You must be Angela.
Hello.
Who are you?
What are you doing at my door?
I'm Cindy Morrell.
I came to pick up Tony.
This is my date.
Won't you come in?
Won't you come in?
Will we be keeping our clothes on?
Talk to Mona.
I'll be a minute.
Tony, what is going on here?
I feeI like I'm losing controI.
I can't come home early, or take a bath I can't even yell out my front door.
- Me and my date'll get out of your hair.
- What is this thing all about a date?
What, I can't have a sociaI life?
I mean, why, because I saw you naked, I'm grounded?
You are supposed to sit with the kids tonight.
I know, but your mother said she'd cover.
- My mother?
- Yeah.
Your mother.
My mother?
Who's the boss around here?
Me or my mother?
Or maybe it's you.
You've gotta excuse us.
We're just having a little pow-wow.
Yes, just settling a little private household matter.
You mean the one you were shouting out the front door?
- Could we just drop the whole thing?
- No.
That is avoidance.
You see, you have to nip these things in the bud or else they'll fester, like a big, ugly boiI that you have to prick with a pin.
- Lovely, Mother, lovely.
- Oh, thank you, Angela.
And what would you do in a situation like this, professor?
I'd go to dinner.
- You're a professor?
Of what?
- I have my PhD in ClinicaI Psychology.
She's no dummy.
Mona, maybe some time you could stage a little psycho drama and help these two work through their problems.
You are going to love psycho drama.
It's like dinner theater for whackos.
Here, now, this is what we're going to do Mona, Mona, I didn't mean right now.
Tony, we do have reservations.
So do I. Lots of them.
Angela, Angela, this is just going to take a minute.
See, now, you feeI foolish and violated because of what happened, see and Tony, Tony feels embarrassed and guilty.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Right.
- I would like to get off the hook here.
- Oh, I'll bet you would.
Oh, good.
I'm going to be the director.
- All right, professor?
- All right, Mona, but hurry.
All right.
Now, Angela, let's say that you walked in on Tony.
- But I didn't, Mother.
- Well, let's say you did.
Tony, you are in the bathtub taking a nice bath - so why don't you do that for us?
- Oh, Mother, this is just ridiculous.
No, Angela.
Get with the game.
All right, now, Tony, make it reaI.
What do you do when you're taking a bath, huh?
Are you enjoying it?
Yeah, I'm really into this.
My fingers are starting to wrinkle here.
Good.
Now the bath is over.
Mona, I just got in the tub.
Get out of the bath and start drying off, huh?
All right.
Now, Angela here you are approaching the door, you see.
You have no idea what's on the other side.
Okay, start your move.
No, I don't know.
I feeI silly.
Come on.
See, this is the moment of truth.
This is the bathroom door.
Now, you are going to open the door and walk in.
Go get him.
Hey!
What are you laughing at?
I can see through your toweI.
Why don't you knock?
Well, why don't you lock the door?
Because I don't have the key.
Oh, yeah?
Here.
Gotcha!
- You did that on purpose, Angela.
- Cut.
That's it.
Now, don't you feeI better, Angela?
No.
- Tony?
- I feeI used and cheap.
I don't understand this.
Don't be discouraged, Mona.
When you're dealing with a repressed personality like this, it takes time.
Shall we go, Tony?
Repressed personality?
She was speaking clinically.
I see.
Well, speaking clinically how would you feeI if Tony walked in on you?
- It wouldn't bother me in the least.
- Yeah?
Come on.
It would bother anyone with a sense of modesty.
I wonder if we're talking about modesty here or subconscious exhibitionism.
We do tend to write our own little scripts.
Are you saying that I wanted him to see me?
Well, you did broadcast it to half of Connecticut: "Tony saw me naked.
" I bet that really got your juices going.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
That's a little rough, huh?
Let's go, Tony.
- You coming?
- Maybe you'd better go by yourself.
Oh, I get it.
She's your boss.
Yeah, she's my boss, but she's also good people.
I'm really sorry you feeI that way, Tony.
- You don't know what you're missing.
- It's a chance I'll have to take.
I guess I can kiss my A goodbye.
I'm sorry if I ruined your evening, Tony.
You miss one gorgeous professor.
Another one will be by any minute.
I'll tell you what, we need some management labour negotiations.
You can definitely use the tub when I am definitely not in it.
And I will definitely knock before I come in.
If I'm gonna come home unexpectedly for dinner, I'll definitely call.
I'll keep something in the freezer, just for you, in case you forget.
And one other thing, about my underwear.
Angela - The speciaI handwashed stuff.
- Yeah, I know.
I'll do it myself.
- DeaI?
- Definitely deaI.
Oh, yeah.
My faith in psychology was never shaken for a single minute.
I knew this would work out.
- You really shrunk us good, didn't you?
- I did, didn't I?
This is a wonderfuI moment.
It's the first time I feeI like we're a reaI family.
- A family?
- Yeah.
After all, we're the only three people in the world that know about your mole.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
No, it's no problem, Tanya.
I'm whipping up my world famous lobster bisque.
Yeah.
Oh, no, that's no problem.
No, no, Mrs. Bower says I can have friends over any time I want.
Besides, she ain't gonna be here.
Yeah.
All right, I'll see you at 8.
Oh, boy.
All right, bye.
It's B'wana Grandma, huh?
When you take the kids camping, you go in style.
I've always wanted to camp out in the great outdoors with the rustle of trees and the twinkling of stars and the babbling of brooks and the bats and the bears and the creepy crawly things.
Hey, maybe we could camp out at the Waldorf.
I thought you were going to get away.
Listen, I'm going camping with an 11-year-old and a 7-year-old.
You are getting away from it all.
I'm taking it with me.
Wonderful.
Eight o'clock.
I'll see you tonight, Mitch.
Mitch?
Is that the one you've been raving about?
Go for it.
I'll meet- I'll meet you at the Four Seasons.
The maitre d' is holding my table.
Wrong!
Wrong, wrong, wrong!
Excuse me, Mitch.
A dog got his foot caught in the screen door.
Mother, you're trying to tell me something.
Your table?
Your maitre d'?
Your restaurant?
Could you just stop being a hotshot executive for one night?
My restaurant because it's my town.
He's flying in from Boston.
Great!
Then have a nice little romantic dinner at home.
A little candlelight, a little wine.
Be a homebody.
That sounds like old-fashioned sexist talk.
And what is wrong with old-fashioned sex?
If they come up with something better, will you let me know?
Mitchell, how would you like to come here for a nice little dinner?
Great!
I'll see you then.
What?
What dog?
He's fine.
He's just fine, Mitchell.
Speak to you later.
Bye-bye.
- Mother.
- Attagirl!
Okay, Angela, now call Entre Nous and have them cater for you.
And it's just going to be the two of you.
All right.
I'm all set.
Micelli's Outfitting Post.
Just the three of us.
Mona, this is great of you, you know.
Samantha's never been camping before.
Yeah?
Who has?
The only time she ever slept under the stars was when she dozed off at the Hayden Planetarium.
All right, pathfinders!
Let's move it!
Let's hit it!
Let's do it!
Give him the rest of the day off.
- Let's move it, guys.
- We're all packed.
The three of us are all packed.
- Three?
- Yeah.
Her, me and Wilbur.
Wilbur's going home.
And the good news is, he's not coming back.
Guess whose wonderful idea it was.
- Say goodbye, Wilbur.
- Goodbye, Wilbur.
- Have a good life.
- Yeah.
Don't take any wooden field mice.
Well, wish us luck.
I am off to darkest Fairfield County.
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.
Be careful.
- Please, drive carefully, Mother.
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.
Take care.
- Bye-bye, Mo.
Bye-bye.
Tony.
Tony, everything looks great.
Why not take the day off?
I've got things I want to do here.
Well, if you're worried about the kids calling, I'll be here.
You will?
Tonight?
Yes.
Tonight.
- For dinner?
- I changed my plans.
I invited someone over.
Why?
No reason.
You didn't have anything planned, did you?
No, no, no.
In fact, now that I think about it, I think I'll I'll call an old friend and head into town, you know?
Sure.
No, maybe we'll bowl a few frames, huh?
Sounds good.
I think I'm gonna die.
Tanya.
Tanya!
It's me, Tony.
Yeah.
Yeah, how are you?
Listen, what kind of a guy am I, huh?
I make you come to the Little Acorn when we could swing in the Big Apple.
That's right.
Yeah, I'm gonna head in, okay?
All right, fine.
I'll see you a little- You want me to say that on the phone?
Okay.
Tanya, Tanya, my little lasagne.
I'll pick you up at 8, because I'd never con you.
All set.
I'm meeting my old friend in town.
Bowling?
Yeah, bowling, and maybe a little lasagne later.
Oh, hey.
Hey, since I'm going out do you want me to whip up dinner for you?
No, thanks, Tony.
I'll take care of it.
You?
I mean, you're so busy.
I am perfectly capable of getting a meal.
Yeah, I know.
Okay, I'm sending out.
Angela, take-out for a friend?
It's not just take-out.
I'm catering dinner for two.
Pretty fancy.
Who is this friend?
Just a "friend" friend.
I get it.
I get it.
Well, listen, since you're having that great grub I happen to have a nice lobster bisque in the kitchen.
You happen to have lobster bisque?
It was a great recipe on the back of the lobster.
- I figured, why not?
- Right.
I'm gonna go It's me, Tony.
I thought you left.
I thought you were upstairs.
You- You look very- I mean, it's- You look- You really - Really, I'm telling you- - Thanks.
Thanks.
You're going bowling?
Well - it's a classy league.
- Right.
- I'm gonna- Okay.
I'm gonna go.
- I'll get it.
Hello?
Mitchell!
Oh, you're not coming.
Oh, no, it's not your fault there's fog in Boston.
No, no- No, nothing special.
It was just a little potluck.
Well, some other time.
Sure.
Bye-bye.
Fog.
Boston.
Boston.
Fog.
I guess it was kind of a special evening, huh?
- Kind of.
- Yeah, well, let me tell you - he don't know what he's missing.
- The lobster bisque.
Yeah, that too.
- Well, I'm sorry.
I gotta hit the road.
- It's okay.
- Have a nice time.
- Thank you very much.
- Bower residence?
- Yeah.
Entre Nous comes to you.
Hey, wait a minute.
You're French?
French.
French is a state of mind.
I'm a great cook, I'm a great lover, and I'm rude to tourists.
- I am Robaire.
- Oh, Robaire?
Robaire, Roberto, Bob, Bobby.
I go where the work is.
- Dinner for two.
- There's been a change of plans.
- It's just dinner for one.
- For one?
$300 for one?
- A lovers' quarrel.
- No, no, no.
Pal, you got it all mixed up.
Sir, look at that poor, heartbroken woman.
- It's not my fault.
- It's always our fault.
- Tony.
Tony, just go.
- No, no, no.
You don't mean that.
Sir, don't be impetuous.
Look.
Duck a I'orange.
Wine.
Escargot.
- This is good stuff.
- Robaire, let him go.
- Angela, I'm sorry about tonight.
- You hear that?
He's sorry.
Don't throw him out.
I'm not throwing him out, Robaire.
He has other plans.
Now, it's just dinner for one.
Good night, Tony.
I know, I know.
Look, Robaire, make it dinner for two, huh?
Hey, I never pass up duck a I'orange.
That's much better now.
How about a little aperitif just for the two of you?
You didn't have to do this because you felt sorry for me.
Hey, this is all part of the deal.
Room and board, right?
Hey, and besides, I know what it's like to get dumped.
Not that you did, you know.
Just because it's crystal clear here doesn't mean it's not socked in in Boston.
- Thanks.
What about bowling?
- Now?
Oh, bowling.
I thought I'd call the guys and catch up with them like, on the fourth beer.
Well, anyway, you're very sweet.
That's much better.
Perhaps a little toast?
To clean sinks.
What a fun couple.
Relax.
Enjoy.
Mademoiselle looks very lovely this evening, oui, monsieur?
He's such a shy and sensitive young man.
Have you told him how handsome he looks tonight?
No.
He is.
You- You are.
- You look very nice.
- Thank you, thank you.
Perhaps I should turn the lights down a little.
- No, no, no!
- No, that's fine!
Tanya, just think of it like a little rain delay.
We're not calling the game, babe.
No, no, no.
Give me this thing.
How do you expect me to leave this sweet old lady in a hip cast?
I swear, I'll be there as soon as I can, okay, babe?
Bye, babe.
Old lady?
Hip cast?
Look, it's a little complicated.
Sir, how can you dally with that lovely woman's affections?
I'm not dallying.
You're dallying.
Could you speed this up a little?
You cannot speed up escargot.
By their very nature, they are slow.
Robaire, she's a very nice lady, but I'm not really her boyfriend, see?
She needed somebody, and she does pay me- She pays you?
- How tawdry.
- Hey, wait a minute.
- I cannot be a party to this.
- You know what?
You're right.
You can't be a party to this.
You're too classy.
- What about the duck?
- Don't worry about those quackers.
I'll pop them in for you, okay?
This never happens when I cater Mexican.
Well, we won't have Robaire to kick us around anymore.
- He left?
- Yeah, I told him I'd take care of things.
- And maybe now we can relax.
- Thank God we're alone.
- Well, we've been alone before.
- Yeah.
Sure.
Just not by candlelight.
Sorry.
Sorry.
It's so quiet around here without the kids.
- Yeah, a whole meal without the kids.
- A whole meal?
The whole night.
We can sleep in in the morning.
I mean, you can sleep in and I can sleep in.
Have some more wine.
Have an hors d'oeuvre.
These are good.
You know, where I come from a fancy hors d'oeuvre is beef jerky and beer nuts.
Imagine that.
I feel like I'm on my first date in high school.
I mean, not that this is a date.
Just that, well, it's not exactly like scrubbing your bathroom floor.
I- I know what you mean about high school.
- There was never anything to say.
- Right?
You know, I'll never forget the time I finally got the nerve up to ask Geraldine Capazo to the Christmas dance.
That was the most embarrassed I ever was.
- You?
- Yeah, me.
You kidding?
My hands were so sweaty, I left a big paw print on the back of her red formal.
Oh, that reminds me.
- Of what?
- Nothing.
- Come on.
- No, I never told anybody this before.
I told you.
Well In college, I asked Greg Dawson to the big sorority ball.
Greg Dawson.
He was like Tom Selleck, but good-looking.
And I lost six pounds.
I bought this incredible strapless evening gown and I spent all day at the hairdresser's.
I'll bet you looked terrific.
Yeah, even my acne cleared up.
And, well I felt like Scarlett O'Hara when I made my grand entrance at the top of this long staircase and there was Greg waiting for me down at the bottom.
And then the heel of my shoe caught in the hem of my dress and I bounced all the way down the staircase.
- You didn't.
- I did.
I did, but my gown didn't make it.
I landed at the at the bottom in my slip and my wrist corsage, and Isn't that awful?
Yeah, it's awful.
I mean, I thought my paw print was bad.
It's terrible.
It's terrible.
I guess it is sort of funny.
A wrist corsage?
Oh, God!
- How soon before dinner?
- About 20 minutes.
Angela?
Hello?
It's me, Mitch.
Anybody here?
Okay.
Kareem, move over because here comes Dr. A. Mitch.
You got here.
Yes, I did.
- Hi, Mitch.
- Hi.
- Well.
- Well, the fog lifted right after I called and the phones at the airport were tied up so I just rushed right on out.
Well, you made good time.
So did you.
Mitchell, I'd like you to meet Tony Micelli, my housekeeper.
- You're not going to buy that.
- It's better than anything I could have come up with.
No, no.
Really, Mitch.
She needed a housekeeper, I needed a job.
- The house looks great, Tony.
- Oh, thanks.
Mitchell, you got- You got here just in time.
- Tony, is dinner just about ready?
- Yeah.
A few minutes.
Oh, you want me to serve?
Well, you are the one who got rid of Robaire.
Yeah, I got rid of Robaire.
Okay.
Hey, yo.
I'll just Robaire?
You mean there was another guy here?
Tanya, I'm out of here in 45 minutes, give or take an orange duck.
All I gotta do is give the old lady a bath and a Fig Newton, and I'm yours.
Hello?
Hello?
I wonder which part she didn't believe.
Boy, you should have seen the fog in Boston.
Gee, I wish I could've been there.
Lobster bisque Neapolitan, huh?
- Italian bisque?
- Oh, it's a house specialty.
Did I ever tell you about my big sorority formal where I bounced down the stairs and tore my gown off?
No.
My God, you must have been mortified.
Well, tell him about the wrist corsage and the slip.
You're gonna love it.
Mitchell, have you ever had a real embarrassing moment?
No.
- Mitch gone?
- Yeah.
- Turned out to be a nice guy.
- Yeah, he is.
Very nice.
Look, Tony I'm sorry about what happened tonight.
- Hey, I enjoyed some of this.
- Me too.
Too bad you missed your bowling buddies.
Yeah.
Well, it's all right.
- You need any help in here?
- No.
It's late.
Why don't you head up to bed?
- Tony?
- Yeah.
Thanks for everything.
Anytime, boss.
Tony!
Tony, the campers are back!
Hi, sweetheart!
Hi!
Mother!
What happened to you?
Some kind of animal.
Daddy, it was a cow.
But a vicious cow.
I bet the snake was happy, huh?
Yeah, I guess Wilbur's happy.
When I let him go, you should have seen the smile on his face.
- That's nice.
- Honey, I know you're gonna miss him but you did the right thing.
It's okay, Mom.
I've got a new friend.
Wait till you meet Ralph.
Yeah.
Wait till you meet Ralph.

What?
Tony!
I'm trying to get some work done here.
You're not bothering me.
Go ahead.
You don't like the DustBuster, okay.
- Hello!
- Hello, Mother.
You're home early, dear.
Did you get fired?
No.
I came home to get something accomplished.
I'm trying to get to my sorority reunion this weekend.
Oh, that's right.
Saturday's the big night.
Wouldn't want to miss a world-class panty raid, eh?
That's gonna be really a nice evening, huh?
Seeing all your old friends, reliving the past rubbing their nose in how successfuI you've become.
The thought never occurred to me.
Of course, if it does come up that I'm president of the 12th largest advertising agency in the country with offices in New York, London and Hong Kong I was going by a toy shop, and I couldn't resist getting this new game for Jonathan.
Mother, you're gonna spoiI that kid.
Who cares?
I don't have to live with him.
- I got it, I got it.
- I can't believe it!
Hello.
Can I help you?
I'm sorry.
I must have the wrong house.
- I was looking for- - This is- Trish!
Trish Baldwin!
Angela!
I guess they know each other.
I don't believe it.
You haven't changed a bit.
Well, you certainly have.
Where's the rest of you?
We're all here.
You remember my mother, don't you?
Mona.
How could I forget?
Trish.
You never even tried.
These old houses are just so charming.
Is this somebody I should know about?
Excuse me.
This is Tony Micelli, my housekeeper.
Trish Baldwin.
Housekeeper.
What a fun idea.
Hello.
- Hello.
- Trish.
Trish, what a surprise.
I didn't expect to see you untiI the reunion.
I couldn't wait that long, so I just came right here from the airport.
Where are you staying?
Oh, my gosh, I can't believe it.
I forgot to make a reservation.
Oh, but I'm sure I'll find something.
I hear the Fairfield Inn is nice.
I'd love to have you stay here, but I've got so much work to do- No, I wouldn't even dream of staying here.
- I just don't think I'm gonna get- - No, not even if you beg.
No, I remember how much trouble you had getting your work done.
Well, luckily, some things have changed since then.
I can work through almost anything.
Are you sure?
Oh, Angela, you are too terrific!
I'd love to stay.
I- I have to go to work tomorrow.
Things may get boring for you around here.
That's never been a problem for me.
Maybe Tony could show me around.
Oh, no, no.
We don't want to impose on Tony.
Hey, hey, impose, impose.
When I signed on here, I knew it wasn't gonna be any bed of roses.
You were going to tune the station wagon tomorrow.
- I can do it on Monday.
- You were gonna do the drapes.
Angela, what's more important, your drapes or your friend here?
The drapes are nice.
Well, now, I don't wanna be the cause of any kind of domestic squabble.
I'll just entertain myself.
Maybe I'll just read some old magazines.
Oh, Trish, don't be silly.
You can stay here, and Tony will show you around.
Oh, Tony, that's so sweet of you.
You got any luggage?
- Just a little.
- Yeah?
Oh, Mother, what could I do?
I guess it's too late to move.
I brought you a little house gift.
Oh, thank you.
How nice.
What were you going to do give it to the bellhop if Angela didn't come through?
Mrs. Foster's fudge!
I don't believe it.
Oh, I lived on this stuff in college.
Of course, I don't go near it at all anymore.
Oh, just a little nibble to celebrate old times.
No, I couldn't possibly.
Maybe later.
Oh, let's see, where should we put you?
Well, she could stay in my room.
Well, how do I know we'll get along?
I'm willing to chance it.
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
She's kidding.
We're both kidding here.
I'm gonna sleep on the couch.
I'll show you the room.
Show you the room?
I'll show her the room.
Well, I see that Trish still knows how to push all your buttons.
Mother, she invited herself.
I didn't have a choice.
Yes, you did, dear.
You just made the wrong one.
Oh, come on, it'll be fun.
We were roommates.
She's witty, she's vivacious.
She was always the life of the party.
Yes.
Your party.
If I hadn't invited Trish, there wouldn't have been a party.
I brought the clam dip.
She brought the men.
And you got the leftovers.
Well, I'm a different person now.
I know how to handle Trish.
Like fudge you can.
Tony, I had a hunch you were an athlete.
- Yeah?
- I'm a very good judge of shoulders.
And it doesn't hurt that you have wall-to-wall clippings.
Yeah, well, it worked out for my career.
It's a small wall.
- Hello, hello.
- Hey!
Hey!
Sweetheart.
Hi.
Trish, I want you to meet my son, Jonathan.
Well, aren't you a handsome young man.
Yeah.
How about calling me Aunt Trish?
Okay, Aunt Trish.
- This is Tony's daughter, Samantha.
- Very nice to meet you.
Likewise, I'm sure.
Jonathan, you are just in time to see some funny old pictures of Aunt Trish and your mom.
You brought the schooI yearbook.
I thought it would help us remember the way we were.
Yeah.
The way we were.
Look, Jonathan, there's your mom.
That's you?
What a tubbo!
Yeah, that's the way I was.
Holy mackereI.
I'd forgotten what a cute little butterball you were.
Yeah, but you melted in all the right places.
- Thank you.
- Okay.
- Is that you, Aunt Trish?
- Well, it is, isn't it?
Yes.
That's when I was queen of the Winter CarnivaI.
Remember, I went with that football star.
What was his name?
AII I can remember were his shoulders.
Robert Andrew Holmby III.
What a memory.
Didn't you have a crush on him?
I don't remember.
Fudge?
Hold it.
What, are you kidding me or what?
Your snack's in the kitchen, apples and milk.
Come on.
- Same place?
- Same place.
- Same snack?
- Same snack.
Get out.
Get in there.
- Those are great kids.
- Those are the greatest kids.
I'd love to have children, but with my career, I just never had the time.
It only takes a few minutes.
Mother, no.
Did Angela tell you about her career?
Well, you wrote that you'd landed a job with some advertising agency.
Not just a job with some advertising agency.
I mean, it's the 12th largest advertising agency in the country.
And Angela's just been promoted to president.
- Oh, Tony.
- President?
- Angela, I am so proud of you.
- Thank you.
I remember when I was first made corporate president.
You know, it was so much fun.
But now that I'm on the board of directors I really long to be back down in the trenches.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
It looks like you had a terrible night, and it's all my fault.
Lie down.
Your back's in spasm.
- You think you could help?
- I think I can help.
- Okay.
- I hope you got a license for this.
Just relax.
Don't forget to breathe, either.
Hey, forget the license, I ain't turning you in.
- Am I hitting the right spot?
- If you're not, you're awfuI close.
- How about here?
- Bingo!
My lower lumbar's in love.
Oh, that's good.
Oh, yeah.
Right there, right there.
Good morning, boys and girls.
Good morning, Angela.
Don't let me interrupt.
I'll go make some coffee.
No, no, that's my job.
I'll make the coffee.
No, I'll make it.
I insist.
It's the least I can do.
Oh, Angela, I'd love to have Tony show me around today if you're still willing to lend him to me.
She's a- What a- She's really- Great friend you got there.
Magic fingers.
- That's not all she has.
- What do you mean?
Don't you see what she's doing?
No, she's got the door closed.
She's coming on to you.
Oh, come on, Angela.
She was just giving me a back rub.
You don't think anything's going on between us.
Well, not yet, but I just don't think that- I don't think that you and she should- I just don't think it'd be a good idea if you did- I just wouldn't.
Oh, I get it.
I'm not good enough for her, huh?
- Don't be ridiculous.
- You could be surprised.
She might fall for my type.
I'm sure she has.
And a lot of other types.
What do we mean by that?
In college, Trish rated ex-boyfriends on the "gum scale" how fast she could chew them up and spit them out.
I remember, Tommy Williams was a Chiclet.
Well, you're looking at Tony Micelli right here and I'm a Dubble Bubble.
Hey, I'm legend in the east New York section of Brooklyn.
You can read about me on the Jamaica Avenue subway stop.
Are you kidding?
Tony, I might be an idiot, but I can't figure out where to put the water in.
It goes right on top, Trish.
Oh, all right.
I'll be right in.
I'll be right in.
She doesn't know how - Want me to show her around or not?
- It's up to you.
I'm not my housekeeper's keeper.
Well, look, I'm gonna go in the kitchen and get chewed up and spit out.
You slay me.
I guess the tour ends here.
You know, Mona was right.
- The Fairfield Inn was very nice.
- Oh, yeah.
Hey, maybe we better put a lid on this.
- I mean, this is where I work, you know.
- Okay.
Well, then I'll just say good night and tuck you in.
I'm a little tuckered out.
So how about we just say good night, all right?
This is good night.
"The tour ends here.
" Chew me up.
Good night.
Darn!
Hello.
Have a nice tour of Connecticut?
Well, you know, I'm not the kind that tours and tells but I think she enjoyed herself.
I don't believe she has the nerve.
In my house!
Oh, hey, nothing happened in your house.
Oh, no?
"This is good night.
" Hey, what were you doing, spying on me?
I wasn't spying on you.
I was snacking.
Yeah, that's another thing.
Ever since Trish came you've had a chip on your shoulder and something in your mouth.
- I mean, what's with you?
- What's with you?
- I'm just entertaining your friend.
- Are you listening?
That's all you are to her, is a night's entertainment.
Well, I wouldn't be too sure, because guess what.
What?
Trish invited me to be her escort to that la-di-dah reunion of yours.
What do you think of that?
It's Friday.
Did you take out the garbage?
You bet your life I took out the garbage.
I did my job.
I forgot the garbage.
Okay.
You were lucky on the last question but this is one you're never gonna get.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
Okay.
What was the name of Howdy Doody's kid sister?
Who's Howdy Doody?
Who cares?
Just think of a dumb girI's name that sounds like " Howdy.
" I know.
Heidi!
- All right!
- All right, so you got it, Heidi Doody.
Looking sharp, Mrs. Bower.
Thank you, Samantha.
Well, that is really a lovely dress, dear.
Thank you, Mother.
Somehow, I think it fit better before I inhaled the pound of fudge.
Wow.
Look at Aunt Trish.
Yes, that's a nice dress too.
Of course, she can afford it, since she saved so much money on hoteI bills.
Angela, you are not gonna believe who I just talked to on the phone.
- You're right.
- Robert Holmby III.
- Really?
- Yes.
He's been calling everyone in the sorority trying to find me.
And you're not gonna believe what a big success he is.
He wants me to meet him for a drink in his hoteI suite before the reunion.
Isn't that shameless?
He's sending his limo.
Trish, could I see you in the kitchen for a minute, please?
Well, yes, but the limo's on the way.
Robert Holmby, after all these years.
How do I look?
What about Tony?
Oh, Tony.
Tell him thanks anyway, but I'll get a ride with Robert.
He thought he was more than a ride.
You know it.
He is so sweet.
- There's the limo.
I've gotta go.
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.
What about Tony?
Angela, he's a housekeeper.
Robert's a Well, he's a Holmby.
You'll explain things to Tony.
You're good at that.
Well, maybe I used to be, but I'm not mopping up for you anymore.
- If you walk out that door- - See you later.
I'll just get out the mop.
So how do I look?
Get back, Travolta!
Here comes Micelli.
Hubba-hubba, big fella.
Hot stuff.
- You look great, just like a magician.
- I look like a magician?
Well, I got some new tricks for them tonight, buddy boy.
Well, I'm gonna go get my corsage.
- Go get them, tiger.
- I love you.
You look great.
You really do.
- I really do?
- Really, really, you do.
- I do, huh?
- You do.
- Well, thanks.
So do you.
- Thanks.
So where's Trish?
Tony, here's the thing.
- Got her a corsage.
- Yes, I see.
Trish kind of has another date.
What do you mean, " kind of has"?
Well, she pretty much does.
Wait a minute.
Are you saying I got dumped?
I wouldn't say dumped.
Yes, I would.
I'm sorry.
You mean she Talk about all dressed up and no place to go, huh?
Any good funerals in town?
I really am sorry.
I really am.
You know, I was just a crummy one-night stand to her.
I was good enough for that, but not to take to the reunion.
I never should have let her stay.
It wasn't your fault.
You tried to warn me.
My mother tried to warn me.
I thought I could handle her.
She walked all over me, all over you, and she walked out.
How about some peanut butter?
- And some jam too.
- Great!
Hey, we got any more of that chocolate layer cake?
- Right here.
- All right.
Oh, I can't believe this woman.
This is good.
Hey, pass me the butter.
- Thank you very much.
- You know something?
You know how she makes me feeI?
Like that fat little girI helpless little girl in college all over again.
- She can't do that to you.
- Oh, yes, she can.
I think this dress is gonna explode.
I'm gonna go upstairs and change into a robe.
No, you can't.
You gotta go to your reunion.
I don't think so.
Wait a minute.
You gotta go.
You can't let her psych you out.
You gotta show those people how great you turned out.
I did turn out okay, didn't I?
Believe me, Angela.
You're more than okay.
Well, thank you, Tony.
You're more than okay yourself.
Hey, I'm from Brooklyn.
What did you expect?
Tony, as long as you're all dressed up No, no.
This is your night.
- Go get them.
- Okay.
- Hey, Angela.
- Yeah?
Knock them dead.
Thanks.
I got dumped.
How do you like that, Mona?
That limo is still out there.
Yeah.
I guess it's Trish saying good night to Robert Andrew " Homely" III.
Knowing Trish, this could be a while.
The nerve she's got, coming back here.
I should've burned her luggage.
They're getting out- They're getting out of the car!
Good night, Robert.
See you next time you're in town.
- Robert Andrew Holmby?
- The Third.
- Well, woo-woo.
- Okay.
Good night.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Come on, ref.
Come on.
What?
Are you blind?
The guy's got a hockey stick coming out his ear.
Hold him and hit him.
Hold him.
Grab the guy and hit him.
That's it.
Come on, baby.
- Tony, what are you doing?
- I'm ironing.
You want pleats in this?
They're jumping all over that guy.
Isn't that illegaI?
Angela, that's a beer commerciaI.
- Would you like a cheese sandwich?
- Yeah, thanks.
- Would you like it grilled?
- Don't go to any trouble.
No trouble.
- There you go.
- At least it isn't wrinkled.
Okay, okay.
Now, don't anybody get excited.
I think the kid's gonna be all right.
- What kid?
- What happened?
Who's hurt?
Now, don't panic.
Don't panic.
I don't even think there's gonna be a scar.
A scar?
Oh, my God!
There you go, Angela.
You see?
You panicked.
- Sam, what happened?
- Don't worry, Dad, I decked him.
Fighting?
You said you were gonna be more carefuI.
I am being carefuI.
I'm not dripping blood on the floor.
- Me too, Tony.
- You too?
- You were fighting too?
- Yeah.
That's how I got wounded.
Oh, my poor baby.
Where?
There.
No, there.
Do you think I need stitches?
No, I think a Band-Aid will take care of that, champ.
It'll be a big Band-Aid.
And maybe two.
And if that don't work, it's time for an elbow transplant.
I don't think that's funny.
- I'm just entertaining the troops.
- I don't really know what happened.
I mean, first they were playing, then they were bleeding.
I mean, I tried to stop it.
Hey, Tony, could you take a look at that too?
You too, Mona?
Yeah, that Welling kid's tough.
Richard Welling?
He's such a nice-looking boy.
Not anymore.
What-?
What-?
What am I gonna tell his mother?
Well, what about?
Jonathan, how did this happen?
You've never been in a fight before in your life.
I had to, Mom.
Sam and Grandma needed me.
Attaboy, Tiger.
I mean, it's good they're sticking up for one another.
"All for one, one for all.
" There is never any reason to resort to physicaI violence.
- She has a point.
Listen to her, Sam.
- But, Dad he called you a sissy housekeeper.
And then there's times, you know, you gotta draw the line.
You should have seen it.
We gave him the old one-two, just like you taught us.
I love the way the kid throws - You've been teaching them to fight?
- Well, I taught them a few things.
A little self-defence.
I also told them, you never fight unless you have to.
- We had to.
- They had to.
It was for a good cause.
Me.
Tony, a 12-year-old boy calling you names is not a good cause.
- PearI Harbor, that was a good cause.
- Hey, look, Angela, I'm with you.
You don't look for fights, but sometimes you can't run away either.
You don't run away.
You walk away.
- Oh, brother.
- CooI it, Sam.
Samantha, you don't go around slugging people.
- Now, did you try talking to him?
- Oh, yeah, I talked to him.
I told him his mother was a cow.
- You're cruising, kid.
- So, what was I supposed to do?
- Stand there and take it?
- Sam, it's very simple.
You just remove yourself from the situation.
You get some space.
You give him some space.
I'll give him some space - right between his teeth.
- Samantha.
Well, that's not the way I'm raising my son.
- What kind of chicken farm is this?
- Hey.
Hey, that's it, young lady.
Outside.
Time for some one-on-one.
Let's go.
Come on, now.
Let's play.
Sam, what's with you?
I don't like you talking that way to Mrs. Bower either.
I can't help it, Dad.
She's starting to bug me.
"Walk away.
Get controI.
Just remove yourself from the problem.
" I'll just snap open my little Mary Poppins umbrella - and fly off to goody-goody land.
- Come on, Sam.
She doesn't wanna see you fight.
Neither do I. Whose side are you on?
Hey, hey, I'm always on your side, but she's got a point.
What do we need her for anyway?
- We were doing fine back in New York.
- Oh, yeah, we were doing great.
I had to take you to schooI in a Sherman tank.
You kidding?
That's why we moved.
So, what was I supposed to do?
I got mad.
Don't people get mad in Connecticut?
Yeah, they get mad in Connecticut.
But they do it differently.
- Like how?
- I don't know.
I think they kick their Cadillacs.
And they smile a lot.
Come on, honey.
I know it's a new neighbourhood and it's new rules, but you gotta try.
- No more fighting, okay?
- Okay, okay.
But it's other stuff too.
I mean, she thinks you can watch basketball without yelling.
I know.
I'm working on that one.
She just doesn't understand.
I mean, you can't yell, you can't fight.
- What are you supposed to do for fun?
- Come on, Sam.
You can have fun.
- Just keep a lid on it.
- I don't have to keep a lid on for her.
She's not my mother.
You are.
And don't you forget it.
Come on, come on.
We're trying to get along here, huh?
- Come on, you wanna take it out?
- I don't feeI like playing.
Jonathan wants to take boxing lessons.
Sure, no problem.
Are you kidding me?
Forget it.
- I'll teach him chess or Parcheesi.
- Thank you.
- Hey, Angela.
- Yeah?
Listen, I was talking to Sam, and she's having some problems.
It's tough to adjust to a new neighbourhood.
- Yeah, and new people too, you know.
- Kids can be rough.
Well, kids aren't the problem.
What is?
Well, it's kind of that Samantha thinks that Angela, maybe we could loosen up here a little bit, huh?
- We?
- One of we.
- Me?
- That's the one.
You think I'm the problem?
- I don't think " problem" is the word- - I'll tell you the problem is.
You and your boxing lessons and your hockey games and your macho beer commercials.
Look, Angela, I talked to Sam, and she's gonna try to watch the fighting.
But here's the thing.
Did I ever tell you how terrific you are and how happy I am with this job?
I feeI a " but" coming on.
No, no, no.
No buts.
However Let me start by saying that it's not your fault.
I mean, you just haven't had our disadvantages.
What's that supposed to mean?
Where we come from it's wall-to-wall people.
I mean, you just don't "get some space and get controI".
You get mad, you yell, and you throw things.
I know, Tony.
I've seen West Side Story.
And now you're on my turf.
Yeah, I know.
And Sam will try to adjust, but give her some time.
And try not be so- So- - So, what?
- Inflexible?
Inflexible?
I am not inflexible.
I have never been inflexible.
If there's one thing I cannot tolerate, it's inflexibility.
- What are you doing?
- Making bees fight.
Let me know who wins.
- What's that?
- Just a note to my dad.
I'm cutting out for a while.
Where are you going?
- Do you have to know everything?
- Yes.
I'm going to a place where it's okay to stick up for people.
My old neighbourhood.
That's where muggers live.
What do you know about it.
It's a great place.
There's always kids around to play games with like stickball or street hockey.
Did you ever fling a rat?
I don't think so.
You get a good dead rat you tie a string to its taiI, then you swing it, and you fling it.
You're lucky.
We don't have rats.
And there's guys sleeping right on the street.
I mean, you could put bugs on them, and they won't even wake up.
I'm telling you, Jonathan, it's the best.
Well, see you.
Wait up, Samantha.
Megafax may sell Naguchi computers.
Well, I'll be darned.
Are these your bees?
No, I don't think so.
Good, because it seems like one of them is eating the other.
What?
No, Mother.
It looks more like they're friends.
You're right.
I've always heard about the birds and the bees but I've never seen it before.
Do you think we're intruding?
I think that I am going to take them outside.
I just saw one of them light up a little cigarette.
- Hey, fish all right for dinner?
- Fine.
- Would you like it broiled or poached?
- Whatever.
I'm flexible.
Hey, listen.
I'm sorry about mouthing off.
I'm just worried about Sam.
- It's not your fault though.
- Well, it's a little my fault.
I'm a little inflexible.
But from now on, I'm a regular Gumby.
Hey, Angela.
You're terrific.
I'm gonna go poach the fish.
BroiI it.
- What?
What?
- That's gratitude for you.
I let the little bugger go, and he stung me.
Are you okay?
No, dear, I was stung by a bee.
- Sometimes I worry about her.
- Come on upstairs.
There's some first aid cream.
What's this?
"To Dad"?
- Is there a " Dad" around here?
- Let me see that.
What does it say?
Well, you'd better let me read it to her.
She can't fire me.
" Dear Dad, don't worry.
I just need a little space and a lot of ravioli.
Your fed-up daughter, Samantha.
" " P.S. I went too.
Jonathan L. Bower.
" Samantha's run away and taken Jonathan.
All right, all right.
It is not the end of the world.
Let's not overreact.
I think I'm hyperventilating.
I got an idea.
- What are you doing?
- I'm calling Mrs. Rossini.
- Who?
- My neighbour in the city.
Sam talks ravioli, that's where she's headed.
To New York?
They went to New York alone?
Two children?
Sam knows her way.
Don't worry.
She jumps on the commuter to Grand CentraI, takes the cross-town locaI to 42nd Street she jumps on the F train- Or is it the E train?
- Mrs. Rossini's not there.
I'm going.
- Well, not without me.
Mother, you stay here in case they call or come back.
Loosen up, huh?
You think I should loosen up about this?
Where do you think she got the advice?
"Go get some space.
" Wasn't that you?
Hello?
What?
What?
Oh, heavens, are you sure?
- What is it?
- What is it?
You've just won a barbecue.
Oh, hey, mama.
You looking good, baby.
Hey, hey.
Watch your manners, huh, paI?
- This is where you lived?
- Yeah, right there.
Look at all the kids in the neighbourhood.
Wait a minute.
This belong to you, lady?
Oh, thank God.
Jonathan, look at you.
You're a mess.
Mom, my cockroach won the race.
Well, at least he died a winner.
Don't you ever run away like that again.
Hi, Dad.
Hi, Mrs. Bower.
I'm glad you're okay, man, and I love you.
- But boy, you're in big trouble.
- Yeah, I figured.
I'll give you "you figured".
Give me that baseball glove.
Your baseball days are over for at least a month.
- Tony.
- Hey, Mrs. Rossini.
You got the kids.
Good.
Don't be too hard on them, Tony.
Remember when you was a kid?
You got drunk on altar wine and mooned the Little Sisters of Hope.
You was so cute.
Yeah.
Yeah, well, at least I was home on time for dinner, Mrs. Rossini.
Hey, and by the way, Mrs. Rossini, this is my boss, Angela Bower.
Hello.
Very nice to meet you.
- What's that?
- Speak up, honey, I can't hear you.
She says you look much younger than she thought.
Yeah?
Stay right there.
I'm coming down.
I think she hardly ever comes down.
Dad, when you said " baseball," does that mean softball too?
Samantha, how could you run away like that and take Jonathan with you?
Hey, I didn't make him come.
I mean, I tried to get rid of him.
Yeah, she tried to push me off the train.
- What?
- It wasn't going yet.
- Tony!
- Hey, Mrs. Rossini.
Is that a faccia, eh?
Yes, it certainly is.
Do you mind?
I never hugged a big shot advertising president before.
You feeI a little thin.
She's not uptight, Samantha.
She's just hungry.
Tonight you'll eat good.
You're staying for ravioli.
- I don't know- - Then it's settled.
You'll stay.
Come on, kids.
You can help me take the plastic off the furniture.
Mrs. Rossini, we'll be back.
I'm gonna show Angela the neighbourhood.
- I'll yell when dinner's ready.
- And I'm sure we'll hear you.
Boy, it feels great to be back.
Taste that air.
Come on, I'll show you.
Hey, see that?
That's where Sam was born.
Yeah, right there.
We lived right over Mrs. Bonaduce.
The smells from her kitchen on a Sunday morning after Mass- Hey, then we got rich, and we moved to the West Side.
We should've stayed where we were, you know because there we lived next to the Sosnowski twins.
One of them was beating up Sam every day.
I would've straightened it out, but every time I caught him he told me he was his brother.
What did I know.
Maybe he was.
Well, maybe that's why she learned to fight.
Yeah, and tiptoe.
I mean, in this neighbourhood- In this neighbourhood you gotta do what you gotta do.
You've gotta see this.
This is Marty's Melody Room.
This is Brooklyn's answer to the Connecticut Country Club.
It's very exclusive, no Wasps allowed.
But it's okay, you're with me.
Hey, Tommy Pepsi.
Billy Fingers.
Hey, guys, what do you say?
- Hey, Joey Mook.
- Hey, what do you say, Tony?
- How you doing, man.
- Mr. Mook.
- So this is where you hung out?
- I practically grew up here.
Are you kidding me?
Had my first beer here played my first pooI here.
In fact, there's a room in the back where I first got - drunk.
- Right.
- Tony.
- Hey, Theresa.
Working days?
" Hey, Theresa.
" That's a greeting?
What happened to " Hey, babycakes"?
- Not right now.
- Babycakes?
So, Tony, who is this?
Theresa, meet Angela.
Angela, meet Theresa.
How do you do?
Oh, I get it.
You're the one with the white picket fence.
I bet Tony's told you a lot about me, huh?
Actually, he's hasn't mentioned you at all.
So how's it going up there?
You having any fun?
Guess not.
A guy could hurt himself on those pointy hips.
- Pointy hips?
- That's it.
- Come on, let's get out of here.
- Oh, no, no.
You promised to buy me a drink.
- Can we order now, miss?
- Sure.
Let me guess.
A Pink Lady?
That sounds lovely, but I'd much prefer a very dry martini.
Fine.
Would you like your olives plain or you want me to stuff them?
- Plain will be fine, thank you.
- I'll have a beer, okay?
- Yeah, sure.
- Sit down.
- Gin on the rocks and draw one.
- You got it.
- So Tony's working for you, huh?
- That's right.
- What exactly does he do?
- Various things.
Yeah?
He used to do various things for me too only I didn't have to pay him.
Hey, Theresa, why don't you just go get the drinks.
Lovely girI.
Yeah, well, she's sort of let herself go, you know.
Hey, try some of these.
These are great.
Peanuts, pretzels and Chees-O's.
- What are the little black things?
- Don't worry.
They can't eat much.
A martini for the boss and a beer for the house- Let me get that all over your Lord & Taylor.
- Hey, that's enough.
- Hey, I'm just doing my job, all right?
- Is he any good with a mop?
- Very.
Yeah?
I never heard of a man keeping house.
Not a reaI man.
Hey, Theresa, why don't you just put a lid on it.
Look out, guys, the housekeeper's getting steamed.
What you gonna do?
Plump my pillows?
Come on, Tony.
Show us what you're made of.
Whip out your feather duster.
I think you're right.
I think we'd better go.
Tugboat Annie here obviously is trying to bait us and I just refuse to stoop to her leveI.
- You're so right.
Let's go.
- Don't you wanna finish your drink?
Theresa, this is my boss.
Will you take it easy here?
Why not.
Please sit down.
What happened to "get controI and find some space"?
Hello, Mrs. Bower.
Hi, kids.
How long have they been here?
Long enough.
That Madison Avenue must be some tough neighbourhood.
Kids, I want you to know that what I did here was wrong.
I should have reasoned with her, but instead, I lost controI and I gave into my baser emotions, and- You nailed the little twit right in the chops.
Yeah.
I guess I did, didn't I?
- Angela.
- Yeah?
- I'm very ashamed of you.
- Yeah?
No tennis for about a month, I think.
Mom, maybe you can teach me boxing lessons?
Well, I tell you, you're gonna live but you're not gonna need any eye shadow on that side.
I still can't believe it.
My daughter, the bar brawler.
Listen, I've got a landlord who's trying to raise my rent so, what do you say, Bruiser you think you could lean on him a little?
I'm glad the two of you are amused but I am discussing a new perfume campaign tomorrow.
- How am I going to explain this?
- Hey, I got it.
Tell them you wore some of their junk and had to fight off a bunch of guys.
That's brilliant.
That's why you pay me the big bucks.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Come on, come on.
Finished?
That's it, kids.
That's breakfast and that's the dishes.
- Off to schooI.
Let's go, boys and girls.
- Oh, well, I hate to eat and run.
I guess this is what they call fast food.
- Oh, good, good.
Good joke.
- Honey.
You have dirt all over your sweater.
He can't go to schooI like that.
You're right.
Come on.
Have a nice day.
Take it easy.
Goodbye.
Two down, one to go.
You can't wear that to work.
If you pull this over my head and turn it inside-out, you're fired.
Come on, Angela.
You're gonna be late.
Let's go.
You're not gonna make the 7:52, and I can't take you to the 8:27.
That's okay, because I'm going to work at home today.
I'm what you might call a lady of leisure.
Are you in a hurry?
Who me?
Nah.
No.
I wanna get to the store.
I wanna get to the store while the produce is still fresh.
It's not even You have no idea how fast this stuff goes bad.
I think it'll keep.
Let's see what do I want for breakfast?
Oh, I don't think you're a breakfast person, are you?
Well, no, not usually, but today I thought I'd have something.
Something nice and nourishing.
Oh, I got it!
Let's see.
Oh, pancakes.
That looks good.
Stuffing?
No.
Here, you'll love this.
Jack Klugman does.
See you.
Where is she today?
Oh, boy.
Hi.
- Hello.
- How are you?
Hey, hey, wait a minute.
You don't just take any two melons.
FeeI the ends.
These aren't ripe.
There, now feeI this one.
And smell.
Now, listen to this.
What are you gonna do, play it?
Listen.
You hear the seeds moving around in there?
It wouldn't do that if it wasn't ripe.
Sir, are you hitting on me?
Me?
Oh, those are great-looking tomatoes, aren't they?
- You're not married, are you?
- I prefer the beefsteak.
Oh, here.
Divorced.
This store's got the greatest produce, huh?
I'm a widower.
You pay a little more, but it's worth it.
I'm sorry.
You haven't been coming here long, have you?
A few weeks.
We just moved up to Oak Hills.
- How many?
- That's a terrific neighborhood.
Two pounds.
"We"?
One for good measure.
Me and my daughter, Sam.
That's the reason why we left New York.
They've got a good schooI there, Oak Valley.
That's my alma mater!
It's the best schooI in New England.
Yeah, I guess I am.
What?
Hitting on you.
Well, I've never met anyone in a supermarket.
Good point.
We haven't been formally introduced.
Oh, hey, sir!
We're in need of some assistance.
Oh, yes.
Look, I'm Tony Micelli, and this is?
- I'm Wanda Benedict.
- Wanda Benedict.
Yeah.
Well, anyway, sir, could you introduce us, formally?
Sir, this is not a singles market.
- I can't do this.
- No, no, you can, you can.
You're a store manager.
They're like ship captains.
They're empowered to make introductions.
- Come on, come on.
- Well Mr. Micelli, may I present Ms. Benedict.
- How do you do?
- Nice to meet you.
Thanks.
Well, what do we do now?
Dance?
Yeah, but not here.
I know this reaI romantic spot over in aisle C. I really have to be going.
I just met you.
We gotta get to know each other.
What else do I have to know?
You have great taste in neighborhoods, melons and cars.
I just happened to notice you drive a Jaguar.
I drive it, but let me tell you something- Oh, wait!
What are you doing?
This is my phone number.
Try not to lose it.
Angela, are those liver spots on your hand?
Mother!
Hey, hey, hey, I got it!
I got it!
What a big pumpkin!
Look, Angela, ain't it beautifuI?
Yes, it's lovely, but somebody has written all over it.
Angela, that's her number.
Oh, Tony, pumpkins don't have numbers.
No, Angela, it's hers, it's hers.
This terrific lady I seen in the supermarket the last three weeks in a row.
Every Monday, 8:30 sharp.
Oh, so that's why we had the Evelyn Wood speed breakfast.
Yeah, it's right after her tennis lesson, you know?
She's so terrific.
She doesn't even sweat.
- Oh, that's a lovely quality in a person.
- Yeah.
She really likes me.
Of course, she thinks I own your house and your Jaguar.
How could you mislead her like that?
Actually, it wasn't that hard.
I mean, the way she was smiling, I didn't even know what I was saying.
I didn't mean to, you know, to start Iying but it was working so good.
Tony, you cannot base a relationship on a misunderstanding.
I know.
I know, I know.
I'm gonna have to straighten it out first chance I get.
Well, at least he has a relationship to straighten out.
- What do you mean by that, Mona?
- Never mind, never mind.
Let's just forget it.
Now, Angela, let's face it.
Lately, your sociaI life has been zilch, zippo.
- Hit a dry spell, huh?
- Sahara City.
- A reaI slump?
- Hey!
You guys don't have to go on about it, you know.
I just think men may be intimidated by my success.
Either that, or the word is out that you don't fooI around on the first date.
You know what it's like?
It's like Barbara Brooks.
- Who?
- Head cheerleader at my high schooI.
Everybody thought she was dated up, you didn't have a prayer with her.
Then along comes bozo Anthony Comisa.
Oh, my God.
Anthony Comisa, right?
He asks her out, she's so desperate, she goes out with him.
Not that you're desperate.
Well, I met this terrific guy named Fred.
- And?
- And?
He found out I was president of the agency and I never heard from him again.
Well, why don't you call him up and give him a hint.
What kind of hint?
" Hello, Fred, I want your bod.
I'll pick you up at 8:00".
Mother!
Cant do that.
I've never asked a man out for a date in my life.
Hey, you know what, though?
I never picked up a socialite in a supermarket before, either.
Well, there's got to be another choice.
I could see what Anthony Comisa's doing.
You wouldn't like him.
Boy, what a day.
I thought your phone would never stop ringing.
Yeah.
Some of the calls were even for me.
I'll get it.
Angela Bower's office.
Oh, hi.
Yeah, this is Rosie.
Oh, sure.
I'm ready.
Look, I'm just leaving.
I'll meet you out front.
Okay, bye.
- Rick?
- No.
- Louie?
- No.
- Alex?
- No.
I'll probably remember who he is when I see him.
Anyway, he'll recognize me.
- Rosie, you've got some life.
- Bye.
Hello, Fred.
It's Angela.
Angela Bower.
I was just reading this article in Cosmo- No.
Hi, Fred.
It's Ange.
How the hell are you?
I can't do this.
Hello.
Angela Bower's office.
No, no.
I'm sorry, Rosie just left.
Can I take a message?
Oh, Guido?
I'll tell her you called.
Excuse me.
You don't happen to have a pen that writes?
Silly question.
You're using a pen that writes.
- Be my guest.
- Thanks.
You don't happen to have a piece of paper, do you?
Thanks.
I really do have to make a note.
I'm not just trying to start a conversation.
Well, maybe I am.
" Rosie.
" No.
Just a minute.
I'm pleased to meet you, Rosie.
My name's Harry Dolan.
Hi.
It's nice to meet you.
Are you in advertising?
Well, if you can call it that.
Back in Des Moines.
Well, surely, you've heard of my famous alfalfa commercials?
Oh, boy, have I wanted to meet you.
I just had an interview with Mr. Peterson and I'm coming back next week to give it the old Iowa razzle-dazzle.
Want me to put in a good word for you?
I bet you are the one who really runs this place.
As a matter of fact I don't suppose you'd be interested in joining me for a drink?
I'd love to.
That's great.
There's something, however, I think I ought to tell you, Harry.
What's that, Rosie?
I've never seen your alfalfa commercials.
Come on.
I'm home.
So, what's new and exciting in your life?
- Well - I've got a date.
He's wonderfuI.
You did it!
Terrific!
You're going out with Fred, huh?
- Harry.
- Harry?
Who's Harry?
He's this terrific guy who just walked into the office.
Hard cheese, Fred.
Harry don't care that you're a big-shot corporate president?
It's not so much he doesn't care, it's more like he doesn't know.
He thinks I'm Rosie.
What do you mean?
I didn't want to tell him who I really am.
I wanted him to like me for myself.
Wait a minute, Angela.
"You can't start a relationship on a misunderstanding.
" I know.
I know.
I'll tell him before my cocktaiI party on Friday.
I want to invite him.
Friday?
Oh, no.
Friday.
Wait a minute.
I wanted to ask you for that night off.
That's the night Wanda's taking me to some fancy shindig.
- Wanda?
- Wanda.
Wanda Benedict?
You know her?
Friday night, she's bringing you here.
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.
How you doing?
How was your date with?
- Harry.
- Harry.
I think I struck pay dirt.
How was your date?
The best.
I wanna hear all about it.
Oh, that looks good.
I like to dunk.
I don't dunk.
I sozzle.
- Sozzle?
- Yeah, sozzle.
The way my mother baked cookies you either sozzled or you broke teeth.
First, you do this.
Right?
And then you do this.
This is gross.
I love it.
So Wanda wasn't upset that you're not John D. Rockefeller?
She said she didn't really care what I did.
- That's wonderfuI.
- Yeah, yeah.
So I didn't tell her.
- Tony, you have to deaI with it.
- I know, I know.
Well, how did you do it?
Was it tough?
Do we have any more cookies?
You didn't tell him.
I couldn't tell him I was president of the agency.
Not after I offered to type his presentation.
It's important to him.
If Jim Peterson likes it, I get to read it.
You better make sure it's typed nice and neat.
I hear you're tough.
I can't tell him before the presentation tomorrow.
It's liable to throw him, and then it'll be my fault.
Nothing to do with the fact you're chicken?
That too.
What about you, Captain Cluck?
I'm gonna tell her.
I want to tell her.
You think it's fun being rich driving around in a Jaguar with a beautifuI woman?
Well, isn't it?
That's besides the point.
This is all gonna end some day.
One of these nights, you're gonna need your car.
Tony, you're making it more complicated than it is.
Open up to her.
Just be yourself, Tony.
Oh, such wonderfuI advice from you, Rosie.
Angela, have you seen my name plate?
Me?
No.
Rosie, I'd like you to stay out front and if Jim Peterson comes by with somebody just tell him I'm not here.
Is something going on I'm not supposed to know about?
Just keep on the lookout for Jim Peterson.
- Angela?
Jim Peterson.
- There he is.
Sorry to barge in, boss but you have got to hear this man's presentation.
Angela, may I present Harry Dolan.
Harry, this is Angela Bower, our president.
Hello.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I've heard so much about you from your secretary.
Oh, thank you.
No, no, no, no.
This is Rosie, Angela's secretary.
This is Angela.
It's a naturaI mistake.
Oh, yeah.
It happens all the time.
Wait a minute.
You're Rosie, and you're Angela?
That's right.
This is Rosie, this is Angela.
He's a slow on names, but wait till you hear that presentation.
Jim?
Rosie?
Why don't I talk to Mr. Dolan alone for a minute?
Sure.
Well, Harry, we're gonna leave you alone with Angela now.
That's Angela Bower, our president.
Boy, I really like the promotion policy of this company.
One day, you're a secretary, the next day, you're president.
Harry, I'm sorry.
I just couldn't bring myself to tell you the other night.
Some men have a thing about women being more successfuI than they are.
And some men have a thing about women who aren't sincere.
I was sincere.
I just lied.
Well, I better get out of here.
I know you're busy.
I mean, you've got this company to run and a lot of typing to do.
Can we talk about it tonight at my party?
I don't know, Angela.
I was kind of looking forward to my date with Rosie.
Hi, Wanda.
- How was the ride over?
- Terrific.
- Anything new?
- Nothing speciaI.
Angela Bower, I'd like you to meet my date, Tony Micelli.
- But we- - No.
Pleasure to meet you, Angela.
Lovely home.
Clean.
Very clean.
Thank you.
- Make yourself at home.
- Thank you.
- You didn't tell her on the way over?
- I didn't have a chance.
We were listening to Elliot Janeway.
That guy is a reaI spellbinder.
Is Harry here yet?
No, and I don't know whether he's coming.
- I'll get that.
- No.
You're a guest.
Oh, you're right.
Here.
- Hi.
- Hi.
That Marcie is such a pain.
She's so selfish.
What happened?
She wouldn't let me try on her training bra.
So I asked Mr. Samuels to drive me home.
And who is this lovely little lady?
I'm Samantha Micelli.
Good night, Dad.
Dad?
Wanda this might be a good time to tell you something.
Come here.
You're gonna find this interesting, I think.
I'm all ears.
Yeah.
Well, you see, by now you've figured it out.
Samantha's my daughter and she lives here.
- Right.
- And she does that because it's handy.
I live here too.
Wanda, you think I'm rich.
I'm not rich.
I live here because I'm the housekeeper.
- The housekeeper?
- Yeah.
Wanda, before you say another word, I want to tell you about this man.
This man is not just a housekeeper.
This man is a hero.
Sure, he could've stayed where he was but he left his home and his friends, and a world that he knew to build a better life for his little girI.
And now you're walking out on him because he's a housekeeper.
Oh, Angela, come off it.
I knew all along.
I mean, this is a small neighborhood.
You don't get a new housekeeper without people knowing.
Especially if the new housekeeper is a Tony Micelli.
I think I'll go speak to the other guests.
You knew?
You knew I was a phony and you never said anything?
I think there's a dishonest move here, Wanda.
I didn't want to spoiI your fun.
Or mine.
Yeah, well, it's all over now anyway.
I can't pick you up in an old van and take you to a beer joint.
I could pick you up in my Mercedes and take you to my country club.
Seems like such a shame not to give it a shot, doesn't it?
Come on.
No, no.
I'm a guest.
Mother, what are you doing here?
I was just on my way to the post office.
I just thought I'd stop by and see if you needed any stamps.
The post office isn't open at night.
Good.
Then I have time for a little drink.
You know about Tony and Wanda and Harry and me.
- You're here because you love intrigue.
- Oh, Angela, put a lid on it.
I mean, I made you and I can break you.
- Hello.
- Hi.
I'm glad you came.
I'm sorry about what happened.
Oh, I'll get over it.
After all, you lied for a very good reason.
Me.
Well, I'm glad you understand.
Yeah, I've given it a lot of thought and you're right.
Some men really are intimidated by very successfuI women.
- I know I am.
- You mean you were.
No, I mean I am.
I do understand your problem but I just can't handle it.
Excuse me.
Maybe it's not her problem.
Maybe it's your problem.
Hello.
I'm Mona.
I'm the president's mother.
Mother, this isn't the time.
It's a perfect time.
I may never see this guy again.
Harry, you don't know what you're missing.
- Mother, I can speak for myself.
- Oh, good.
Harry She's pretty much covered it.
You know, I think the mother of the president might be right.
How do you feeI about lunch?
It's one of my three favorite meals.
What a coincidence.
Mine too.
Now, is there anything else that I should know about?
No.
No more secrets.
I have nothing else to hide.
Hi, Harry.
I'm Tony Micelli.
I'm Angela's housekeeper.
I live here.
You really think I'm a hero?
You know me.
I have a tendency to get carried away.
- I think maybe I overstated it a bit.
- No, no, no.
Not this time.
When you're right, you're right.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
- Hammer.
- Hammer.
- Wrench.
- Wrench.
Beer.
Beer.
Here's to good pipes.
So, what do you think of this outfit?
Well, that looks nice, Mother, but the other one was nice too.
Angela, I am not looking for " nice".
I'm looking for "va-va-va-voom"!
You found it, baby.
- Thank you kindly.
- Mother, my blue scarf - would look terrific with that.
- Thanks, Angela.
Isn't it fun being roomies?
Well, Mother, you're welcome to stay with me any time you burn your apartment down.
Angela, I didn't exactly burn it down.
It's just a little smoke damage.
- And a few charred drapes.
- Yeah, and some old chairs.
The living room.
I think I will try the blue scarf.
Okay, Angela.
Would you like to go outside, turn on the water?
We'll check this baby out.
Tony, maybe we should have called the plumber.
It's fine, Angela.
Could you please turn on the water?
I'll give you a plumber - All right, ready?
- Okay!
Let her rip.
Dry as a bone.
Boy, it's great down here.
Micelli, you're the greatest.
Oh, wait!
Hold it!
Shut it off!
Shut it off!
- Is something wrong?
- Just a little dribble.
But you know me, I wanna make it perfect, you know?
I'm going to go down to the hardware store and get a washer.
Come with me.
Take a walk.
Angela, you're right.
The blue scarf is just perfect.
Mother, that's an entirely different outfit.
- You don't like it?
- It's not that I don't like it.
It's just- Oh, dear!
There's my study group.
Please, would you get the door?
I think these shoes are just entirely wrong.
- You think my mother's acting strange?
- With Mona, it's hard to tell.
- Hey.
- Hi.
We're Mona's study group.
Hey, well, I'm Tony Micelli.
Come on in.
- I'm Ralph.
This is Laura, Jason.
- Hi.
- Hello.
- How do you do?
- I'm Angela, Mona's daughter.
- You must be the teacher, huh?
- No, I'm a student.
- Oh, yeah?
Just like Mona, huh?
Oh, come now.
Nobody's just like Mona.
- Well, look- - Yes, she is a very speciaI woman - isn't she?
- Now, look you kids get all your work done, or no TV tonight.
- Tony.
- I'm going.
I'll see you later Mother, don't you look nice?
This old thing?
Just a little something I threw on.
Well, it landed just right.
You old flatterer.
Now for the important things.
I'll get the munchies.
Come on in.
Make yourself at home.
Mother, that's a very nice looking man over there.
You should see him breakdance.
- I thought maybe I could help you.
- Oh, all right.
There you are.
Well, that certainly does help.
Supposing someone should come in though?
So what?
I'm just not ready to go public yet.
There's nothing wrong with what we're doing.
Oh?
Then does that mean you've told your mother?
Well, no.
- Did you tell your daughter?
- Oh, no way.
You've got to understand Angela.
She's kind of a young fogey.
I wouldn't even know where to begin.
I know just what I'd say.
I'd say, " Mom, I've met a wonderfuI woman.
She's got more curiosity and enthusiasm than anyone I ever met.
And she's not a bad little dancer either.
" I'm sorry.
Now, Tony, this is not what you're thinking.
I ain't thinking.
I'm sure that you've seen two people kissing before.
Not these two.
I came in here for the old washer.
See, I went to the hardware store.
I'm fixing the sink, and the water, it went all over the place.
- I'll take the iced tea out.
- But I can fix it, see?
I found the washer.
I'm gonna go fix it now.
Now, Tony.
Tony, I need to talk to someone.
I could send someone in.
How about Angela?
She's a great listener.
- I've heard her listen.
I'm telling you.
- Tony, she's the last person I want to talk to about this.
- Please.
- Mona Please?
Lay it on me, Mone.
Well, you see, I didn't go looking for someone younger.
It's just that I'm going to college now, and I found this college person.
That makes sense.
I guess I missed out on a lot the first time around.
See, I quit college to get married and to raise a family and so when all my girlfriends were being serenaded by fraternities Angela was spitting up on me.
That's our girI.
Jason and I met in class, and one day we went out for coffee and we started telling each other our life stories.
Of course, his didn't take very long.
I don't know.
We just clicked, right from the beginning.
He understands me, and we have fun together.
Yeah, I saw.
Well, you know, when I came in, I saw Just a minute.
What do you think we've been doing?
I don't know.
No.
No, you're wrong.
We haven't.
I don't even think I could.
I mean, what would people think?
What people?
Do you mean Angela?
She's the only people that really count.
Mona, all I know is one thing, you know?
You only go around once in life.
If you get the chance to go twice, I think you gotta take it.
- You're right.
- I am?
Yes, and you're terrific.
Too bad you're not Mom?
- Who are we spying on?
- Jonathan, we're not spying on anyone.
Honey, we're just trying to get a better look at Grandma's new boyfriend.
You mean, without them seeing us?
That's spying.
- It's time for bed, Jonathan.
- Who is he, anyway?
He's the nice-looking man with the gray hair.
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.
- Sink's all fixed.
- Great.
- What's going on?
- We're spying on Grandma's boyfriend.
- Go to bed, Jonathan.
- Me and my big mouth.
Who told you about Mona's new beau?
Nobody had to tell me.
I knew it the minute I saw them together.
That's what happened to me.
I mean, when I saw them smooching in the kitchen.
Smooching?
That's wonderfuI!
Wait a minute.
You don't mind?
I mean, I really thought the age difference was gonna bother you.
Oh, come on, Tony, loosen up.
What's a few years?
These are the '80s.
Well, gee, that's terrific.
Why not go downstairs and buzz in her ear?
Tell her you're in her corner.
- That's a wonderfuI idea.
I'll do it.
- Oh, boy, I love a happy ending.
- Mother?
- Yes?
I was just talking to Tony.
About what?
About you and your new beau.
Benedict Arnold!
I didn't rat you out.
She figured this one herself.
Mother, I'm thrilled.
Angela, I'm stunned.
I think it's just what you need.
My God!
The hospitaI didn't switch babies on me!
Mother, you can stop sneaking around.
I'm with you on this.
And I think we need to get this relationship out into the open, into the sunlight, where it can grow and flourish.
Oh, you're right!
And there's no time like the present, huh?
Listen, everybody.
Guess what?
I have been keeping a secret which has made me a little crazier.
So in the interest of mentaI health I want you all to know I have a boyfriend.
Isn't that cute?
A boyfriend!
And he's right here.
Cute couple, huh?
It's them.
Did Grandma and her boyfriend get home yet?
- Go to bed!
- Yeah, go to bed.
You're too young for this stuff.
Well, I wanna kiss Grandma good night.
Take a number.
Well, here they all are, the moraI majority.
Mother, isn't it a little late?
Where have you been?
Well, gee, I'm sorry, Mrs. Bower.
I ran out of gas.
Oh, come on, you can think of one better than that.
How about a flat tire?
If you were going to be late, young man the least you could've done was call.
Well, I didn't know I had a curfew.
Well, it is a schooI night.
What are you gonna do, Angela, ground her?
I should be very annoyed with all of you for waiting up.
But I'm not, because I want to share something with you.
- I've been pinned!
- What?
Where's the pin?
My pin!
It was on my sweater.
- Oh, my gosh.
- I found it!
- I'll get it.
- No, no, I'll get it.
- I'm the housekeeper here.
- Take the afternoon off.
I'll get the door.
I'll get the door.
I said I'll get it.
I'm Jason's mother.
You must be the Bowers.
No.
No, we're not.
I am.
He's not.
I'm Angela Bower.
I'm Tony Micelli.
I'm the housekeeper here.
I'm sure you are.
- Come in.
- Oh, my husband will be right in.
He's parking the car.
Oh, well, Mrs. Franklin- Hilary, please.
Hilary, I'm not sure I did the right thing by calling you.
The whole thing's in doubt.
Tony, would you mind getting us some coffee?
It's my afternoon off, Angela.
But what the heck?
Oh, Hilary, I just wondered what chance two people have when their ages are so far apart?
Teddy.
Boy, that walk really slants up.
Dear, this is Mona's daughter, Angela Bower.
Nice to meet you, young lady.
Nice to meet you.
Come in, please.
Tony, this is Ted, Hilary's husband.
And if you make any remarks, I'll kill you.
Ted and Hilary.
And this is Tony Micelli, Angela's housekeeper.
Housekeeper?
Next thing you know, men'll be having babies.
And I'll name the first one after you, Teddy.
Angela was just saying she's very worried about the difference in Jason and Mona's ages.
It's not so much their ages as their other differences.
Whatever they are.
Well, I think the whole thing is a lot of horse pucky.
I'm sure your mother's an okay lady but she's just too old for our boy.
Somehow our son thinks that we should be understanding just because of the difference in our ages.
Oh, is there a difference?
It's not the same thing at all.
He's got an older lady, and I've got me a young chick.
- Teddy.
- Excuse me.
Excuse me?
Excuse me.
You seem to be saying that it's okay for a man - but not for a woman.
- That's exactly what I'm saying.
It's the way of the world.
Yeah, but, Ted.
Ted?
Teddy.
The world is changing.
Well, you're certainly doing your share.
Why don't we get down to brass tacks?
Now, we have got an unacceptable situation here.
Hey, wait a minute.
My mother is not unacceptable.
My mother is a terrific lady!
And if the kids are having fun, what's it to you?
Live and let live!
Well, Mother, I don't think that we should overstay our welcome.
Oh, I think we already have.
Oh, no, it's been wonderfuI.
Really.
FeeI free to drop in anytime.
Call first.
Mother, what are you doing here?
Well, I've been hiding out on the patio untiI the Franklins left so I could come in and ask you, Angela what the hell were they doing here?
- Well, I just wanted to- - Mona, you should've seen her.
She told the old geezer, " Dummy up.
If a man can date someone younger so can a woman.
" She was great!
But she's not a woman.
She's my mother!
I still think what you're doing is irresponsible.
Listen, Angela, when you were growing up I didn't always agree with your decisions but I did always try to support you.
Mother, I just can't say it's okay if I don't think that it is.
Well, I like him, and I'm dating him, no matter what you think.
You've got nobody to blame but yourself if your mother runs away from home.
I was upstairs taking a few wrinkles out of your mother's prom dress.
- She sure looks beautifuI.
- That's very nice.
Aren't you even gonna go upstairs and see her before Jason picks her up?
Mother and I have gone around and around about this.
- We'll just get into another fight.
- Angela, it's her prom night.
It's one of the those things she missed when you were throwing up on her.
I can't help it.
She's about to make a fooI out of herself.
How do you think those college kids are gonna react when she goes out with Jason?
- Kids that age can be very crueI.
- Yeah?
Well, maybe kids at any age.
Tony, I just don't want her to be hurt.
Come on, Angela!
You're hurting her.
It's your mother.
You know how much she wants you to go up there?
I'm the last person she wants to see.
Why don't you give me a break, huh?
What you think means a lot to her.
You're the most important thing in her life.
My mother said that?
Well, I cleaned it up a little bit.
Mother, you look beautifuI.
You're just saying that.
But you could say it some more.
All right.
Mother you look beautifuI.
Oh, who am I trying to kid?
- I'm acting like an old fooI.
- Don't ever say that.
I don't have to say it, Angela.
You said it for me.
Oh, for crying out loud, Mother.
You've never listened to me before.
Why are you going to start now?
Well, you've always been a pretty smart cookie.
That's because I take after you.
Well, Miss Scarlett, there's your date.
I I can't go through with this.
You tell him something.
- What should I say?
- I don't know.
I'll think about that tomorrow.
- Hey.
- Hi, Tony.
Boy, you're looking sharp, champ.
Gee, it reminds me of my senior prom.
I was only there half the time.
Me and Bobby Guvernale were sharing a tux.
I remembered that suggestion you made.
I took care of it.
- It's a great idea.
- It's gonna be great.
I'm gonna get her.
So you think I should go?
It's up to you.
You're a big girI now, Mother.
It's time for me to let go.
Just here for moraI support.
Hey, hey, come on, come on, come on!
They're playing your song.
Yeah!
Oh, boy.
Oh, boy.
Oh, boy.
That's great, huh?
How's it feeI to have the most popular mother on the block?
- Actually, kind of good.
- Yeah.
- I was really touched by that serenade.
- Yeah, touched, huh?
- You were salivating.
- What?
I saw the way you looked at that guy.
- What guy?
- The one in the back.
You're crazy.
I never saw any guy.
Besides, I don't like redheads.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Okay, book-busters, let's move it, let's hit it, let's do it.
- You got everything?
Gym shorts?
- Check.
- Homework?
- Check.
Science project?
- Samantha?
- Don't worry, Dad, I've got everything.
Books, lunch money, and homework.
Check, check, check.
Ice skates for Marci's party?
- You got me.
- That's why I have this.
We'd better go.
That film studio's all the way in Brooklyn.
Your carriage awaits, but do you have everything?
You bet I do.
I have the most important new account in my career.
I have Lankershim Cosmetics and I have the client eating out of my hand.
- Do you have your portfolio?
- I don't have that.
Sweetheart, isn't that a wonderfuI prehistoric thing.
Have a good day in schooI.
Bye.
Well, I'm all ready.
Okay, here's your lunch money, buddy.
Remember, if you talk science, keep that receipt.
It's a write-off, all right?
And I hope they really like your little volcano.
Yeah, for show-and-tell he's gonna sacrifice a Barbie doll.
Give me a kiss.
- All right, be good in schooI.
- Okay, bye.
- Hi, Mona.
How you doing?
- Hi, short people.
Mona?
Mona, Mona - No, I don't see you on my list.
- No?
Well now I'm on it, right next to "take out trash.
" That's not "trash," that's "Trish," but you're close.
Well, so today's the big day, huh?
Lights, camera, action.
Hello, Mother.
You can't go with me.
Angela, do you think that that's why I'm here?
Why can't I go with you?
Because presidents of advertising agencies don't take their mommies to work with them.
Well, don't think of me as your mommy.
Think of me as a stockholder.
I just invested in Lankershim Cosmetics.
Mother, how sweet.
You have that much faith in my deodorant campaign?
No.
Advertising campaigns come and go but sweat is forever.
Come on, Angela.
Let her go.
We won't get in the way.
- We?
- Yes.
You won't even know we're there.
Look at this, look at this.
A movie studio.
I can feeI the magic in the air.
Hey, look.
They make it look just like a reaI bathroom.
It's clean, it's clean.
It's not very private, but it's clean.
Angela, don't worry about a thing.
We're gonna stay out of the way over here in a corner so go over there and act important.
Make a decision.
I already made one, but you came anyway.
She's the president, you know.
You wouldn't have a job without her.
I'm a lucky guy.
Who are these people?
Herb, this is my mother, Mona Robinson.
Oh, your mother?
Without you I wouldn't have a job.
And my housekeeper, Tony Micelli.
- Hey, how are you doing?
- Housekeeper?
You know, you could call me the maid but I wouldn't.
No, housekeeper's my first choice.
How about those Jets, huh?
Best behaviour, you two.
This is the client.
- Mr. Larson, good morning.
- Hello, Angela.
Well, today's the day we make a household word out of Machismo Scented Seven-Day Deodorant Shower GeI.
I like the way you think.
And you must be our Machismo Man.
Oh, no, no.
This is Tony Micelli.
- He's- - Perfect.
Thank you.
He's my housekeeper, Mr. Larson.
We have an actor, Lance Wetherby.
He's in makeup.
Go tell Wetherby to take the curlers out and go home.
This man has that Machismo look.
You bet he does.
- Who are you?
- I'm his agent, "Swifty" Robinson.
Smile, Tony.
I think you're about to be discovered.
Wait a minute.
You mean they want me to be in the commerciaI?
Yeah.
Flex.
I'll work out the negotiations.
- We're almost ready to roll here.
- J.J., we've had a little change here.
Tony Micelli is going to be our Machismo Man.
I am?
I'm gonna be the Machismo Man.
Mr. Larson, Tony is not an actor.
Wait a minute.
I was a cameI in my third-grade Christmas play.
Vivian Lordasino was the other hump.
I'm sure you were great, bubele, but this is the big time.
- Listen, J.J.?
- Yeah?
Did Angela tell me you did that commerciaI on YouthfuI You fade cream?
Yeah, that won me a Clio award.
Well, I'm sure if you can work with dancing liver spots you can work with Tony.
Work with him, J.J. Work with me, J.J. Okay, take your shirt off, bubele.
Just a minute.
Keep your shirt on.
Mr. Larson, are you sure-?
Angela, I like an agency that goes for the unexpected that's willing to take chances.
Like I said, bubele, take your shirt off.
Okay, Tony, babe, this is just a rehearsaI now, okay?
You're in the shower.
You're really feeling good.
You know you're not gonna smell for a week, okay?
You do your spieI with the product, you get out, you toweI off - then we're in the arms of your lady.
- What lady?
And they pay you too?
Yeah.
Ginger, honey.
Okay, now, you come in, you see him.
He's wet.
He's sexy.
He's really smelling good.
For a week.
I'll do the jokes, babe.
Now, you get one whiff and you lose controI.
- Okay?
Okay.
- Okay.
Here we go.
That's great.
That's great, sweetheart.
Nuzzle his ear, nuzzle his ear.
Oh, you- You nuzzle great.
Yeah, well you move your hand one more inch and they're gonna be calling you Van Gogh.
That's great.
That's great.
Now, Ginger, honey- Now, let's have your line.
I like it too.
Perfect.
Okay, from the top.
Places.
Here we go.
Here we go.
Get your robe off.
Attaboy.
Here we go.
Okay.
All right.
Let's see some suds, Tony.
- Hey, what the-?
- Come on.
- Now, Tony - Yeah?
just act naturaI.
Do whatever it is you do in the shower.
- Anything I do?
- Yeah.
- Except sing.
No singing.
- I don't do singing.
- You want a donut, Angela?
- Don't talk to me.
Well, that's gratitude for you.
I mean, I brought you your new star.
You're gonna change your tune when we're packing for the Love Boat.
Bon voyage, Mother.
Okay, just read what you see on the cue cards.
- Okay?
Okay.
- Okay.
Here we go.
Ready?
And action.
Sure you probably shower every day but even if you didn't, no one would know not if- Not if you use new Machismo Scented Seven-Days Deodorant Shower GeI.
That's protection.
Cut.
Excuse me.
I have to go and call my broker and dump some stock.
- Tony?
- Yeah?
What's this face?
What is that?
What?
Are you in pain?
Bathing suit a little tight?
Okay.
Okay.
Let's try it again loose naturaI.
Okay.
Okay.
That's it.
- Loose.
- Okay.
Let's pick it up from there.
Loose, man.
So no matter how hot and sweaty I get I know I'm covered with Machismo.
I like it too.
Okay, cut.
That's lunch.
Bernie, get me out of Lankershim Cosmetics.
I don't care what E.F. Hutton says.
When Mona talks, you listen.
- So, Angela, how was I?
- Looser.
Much looser.
Somehow, I don't think we captured your quiet brilliance.
Quiet brilliance?
- J.J. - Yeah?
Can I have a word with you?
I think I have an idea.
My man uses Machismo Scented Seven-Day Deodorant Shower GeI.
So I know no matter how hard he works or no matter how hot and sweaty he gets I know my man's covered with Machismo.
I like it too.
Okay, cut.
That's perfect.
That's a wrap.
We'll do product and stills tomorrow.
- BeautifuI.
- Angela, if sex sells soap and we know it does, we're gonna clean up.
We're gonna get shot in the fanny with nickels.
I can hardly wait.
Hello, Bernie?
Put everything I've got into Lankershim Cosmetics.
Yeah.
Buy, buy, buy.
Bye.
Oh, boy.
Dad, tell us about the commerciaI.
All right, sit down, sit down.
Well, there's really not much to tell.
AII I had to do was take a shower and I got plenty of practice doing that in the minor leagues.
Tony, don't be modest.
Your dad was terrific.
I mean, when he lathered up, I got goose flesh.
Well, you know, I did do some pretty interesting things with them bubbles.
Dad, what are you doing?
You look like you need a flea collar.
I need something, man.
I've got this itch.
Scratch over there.
Scratch lower.
You, higher.
Higher, higher.
Higher.
Scratch.
- What is it?
- Tony you've got a terrible rash.
- Look at this.
I'm burning up.
- Dad, what's wrong?
- Oh, my God.
- Tony, what if it's from the Machismo?
- You don't think - What else?
Boy, am I glad I wore that little bathing suit.
- Here, is this good?
- Lower, lower, lower.
Hello.
I'm home.
We're in the kitchen.
Hello, wonderfuI people.
I love my life.
- Have a nice day at the office, dear?
- Sublime.
Tony, you were great.
I don't know what you've got, but it's something.
And I have a feeling you haven't even scratched the surface yet.
Yeah, well, I'm glad it worked out, Angela, but- Worked out?
Machismo Man speak truth.
We are finally in solid with Lankershim Cosmetics.
Yeah, well, that's good, because What is going-?
What is going on here?
- Man.
- Angela, you may have noticed that there's something a little different about Tony.
Do you know that expression, " into each life a little rain must fall"?
Yeah?
Well, get out your galoshes.
We're talking monsoon here.
Angela, I've got a rash all over my body, everyplace.
Look at this.
All over your body?
Well, except for where the little bathing suit was.
Angela.
Tony.
My stars are here.
Wait till you see the stuff we shot yesterday.
SensationaI.
That's nice, but, Mr. Larson I have something to tell you that's a little painfuI for me.
- PainfuI for you?
- Well, what's the problem?
Show him, Tony.
That's a bad rash.
Yeah, and he's got it all over his body not that I've seen it.
You see, the thing is, I got this from that Machismo gunk.
- What makes you say that?
- Well, I sent the gunk to a lab and I had it analyzed.
And they say that we can expect this result in two percent of the people who use it.
- Good.
- Good?
Our fellas said three percent.
Let's go with your numbers.
Hey, wait a minute.
You saying you knew about this?
Mr. Larson, I know that there are some considerable risks with these products.
But I'm a little uncomfortable with this.
I may have to resign the account.
Yeah, me too.
I'm hanging up my toweI.
Oh, now, wait a minute, wait a minute.
Aren't the two of you overreacting?
Why, even God makes products that are bad for some people.
If my cousin Susie even looks at seafood she swells up like a blowfish.
But you don't see God recalling shrimp.
Yeah, Mr. Larson, that's true, but this stuff could irritate a lot of people.
So can Joan Rivers, but she keeps working and so do we.
We keep trying to improve our product.
And, Angela, you just keep doing the advertising.
And by the way, you're doing a damn fine job.
Well, thank you.
And you know, Lankershim has a lot of other products that I'd like to get your thoughts on.
I'd love to see how you would handle a really big account.
How big?
Our dandruff shampoo.
That big.
You add that to Machismo and we're talking $10 million.
Maybe we could have lunch.
Hey, $10 million for dandruff?
That's a lot of flaky people, huh?
And we're gonna take care of your problem, Tony.
You are?
Sure.
Next commerciaI we're gonna use a phoney geI.
Then I gotta say I'm using something I'm not.
Well, we could have another actor collect all those residuals.
Three, $4000 a month.
Gee, I could finally junk that old van.
I think you ought to sleep on it, Tony.
I could get myself a convertible.
I'd hate to see you throw all this away just because of a little itch.
That would be a rash decision.
"This was the kind of woman you fantasize about.
Only this was no fantasy.
She was six feet tall and all girI.
She slithered toward me, her size-36 gown was hugging her size-38 body.
Well, it was easy to see she wasn't concealing a weapon.
" Oh, gosh, there's the car.
Look, if anybody asks, you've been asleep an hour and a half and I read to you from The Hardy Boys.
Now, beat it.
- Thanks, Grandma.
- Good night, Mona.
Oh, and we won't mention the hot fudge sundaes either.
Amo, amas, amamos.
Amamos?
Hello, Mother.
- Are the kids asleep?
- Oh, yes, for hours.
So how did it go with Mr. Larson?
- Oh, fine.
- Fine, fine.
You know, fine.
Actually, pretty good.
Yeah, he gave her dandruff.
The account.
You mean, instead of the Machismo account?
Well, no, I'll kind of be working on both of them.
Didn't you show him the rash?
Well, you know, what was left of it.
It's clearing up fast.
As soon as my legs, my stomach, and my back clear up, it's gone.
And my arms.
I see.
So he is not taking it off the market?
No, not exactly.
He's improving it.
Yeah, which is more than God's doing.
He's not doing a thing about shrimp.
Shrimp?
I smell something fishy.
What do you mean?
- You both sold out.
- We did not.
The dandruff account is just a little bonus.
Yeah, right.
And Tony's little bonus is parked out back in the driveway.
- What?
- Here.
He bought me a car.
He bought me a car.
It's red.
It's gorgeous.
It's mine.
Leather seats.
Five on the floor.
AM-FM.
The clock works.
Baby, this is love.
And it's not just a physicaI thing.
Angela, look at this.
Angela?
Angela, where are you?
Angela, don't you want to see it?
Angela, this ain't a bribe.
It's a bonus.
It's just like your dandruff account.
It's a bonus.
You're right, it's just like my dandruff account.
No.
No, it's not.
That's not what I meant.
- No, no, no.
- Yes, yes, yes.
- No.
- Yes.
Yes?
Oh, no.
I'll call Mr. Larson and resign the account in the morning.
And I'll give back the car.
You're doing the right thing.
Don't rub it in.
Well, honesty is the best policy.
I mean, even if nobody else in the whole world knows it you'll know it.
You've gotta be true to yourself.
I'm proud of both of you.
All right, all right!
So the kids just went to sleep.
I read them a trashy noveI.
I stuffed them full of hot fudge sundae.
So are you happy?
Tony?
What are you doing out here?
It's 4:00 in the morning.
It's 4:02 in the morning.
I stand corrected.
- You couldn't sleep either, huh?
- Not a wink.
I thought when you had a clear conscience you're supposed to sleep like a baby.
Not when it costs you a $10 million account.
- Or a red convertible.
- Yeah.
This is the sexiest Italian machine I've had my hands on since Doreen DiSpenza.
Well, a lot of firms would've taken that account and let the client deaI with the consequences.
Yeah, I know.
In the minors, I knew guys who'd drop a fly ball for 100 bucks.
Yeah.
Have a seat.
Thank you.
So, what's wrong with us?
We're a couple of patsies.
No.
It's worse than that.
We're honest.
You know if I scratch a car in a parking lot, I leave a note on it.
Really?
I draw a wavy line through a stamp when it comes through the maiI uncanceled.
Yeah?
I if I'm shopping and I eat a cherry, I take the pit to the checkout girI.
You really are a sap.
Angela, I always wanted a convertible.
Closest I ever came was when the top of my old man's car rusted out.
You know, Tony, you don't have to take this car back untiI tomorrow morning.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
- Breakfast?
- New Hampshire?
I'll get the kids.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
All right, three seconds left in the game.
Blue, 21.
Hut one, hike!
Micelli fades back.
He tries to find a receiver.
Can he find her?
Yes!
He throws the ball to Micelli.
And it's- - Dropped in the end zone?
- Sorry, Dad.
What do you mean sorry?
We were on our way to the Super BowI.
I don't feeI like playing anymore.
Come on, I was just kidding.
It wasn't the Super BowI, it was the Rose BowI.
Forget it.
Boy, those wide receivers are so sensitive.
Honey.
Well, that was quick game.
Honey.
Forget about it.
We'll work on it.
We got all next season.
You just gotta tuck the ball into your chest.
But, Dad, it hurts when I catch it like that.
Since when?
Come on, it doesn't hurt if you do it right.
I've got homework to do.
How do you like that?
Sam would rather do homework than play football.
- You think she's sick?
- Maybe you're throwing the ball too hard, Popeye.
Well, I yam what I yam.
No, I'm throwing it the way I always throw it.
Maybe she's losing interest in football.
Sam could punt before she could walk.
- Well, tomboys do grow up, you know.
- And out.
Out.
Oh, you mean And she can't tuck the ball in the way she used to because What is this?
What is this?
What is it?
What?
What are you talking about?
Well, Tony when girls get to be a certain age, their bodies begin to change- Angela.
Angela.
I know about the birds and the bees.
But the birds and the bees don't wear bras.
Wait a minute.
Are you trying to tell me that Sam needs a bra?
- Are you serious?
- Cross my heart.
She's just a little girI.
Yes, well, so was Elizabeth Taylor but one day she was National Velvet and the next day she was Cleopatra.
And she will be 12 the day after tomorrow.
All right, look, I'll get her one when the time comes.
I believe the time has come, and I think the stores are open.
- Come on.
- All of her little friends are beginning to wear them, and she even talked to me about it.
You?
Why didn't she talk to me?
Well, isn't it obvious, dear?
She needed a role modeI.
How come she didn't talk to me?
I'm her father.
Tony, a girI usually talks to a woman about these things.
I'd be glad to help Sam go shopping.
No, no, no.
That's all right.
No problem.
Hey, I bought her a fishing rod.
I bought her hockey skates.
I'll buy her a bra.
Tony, listen, it's not quite the same thing.
They were ladies' skates.
Don't touch it if you're not going to wear it.
I was- I was- I was just looking for a bra.
- I mean, for my daughter.
- And what size is she?
I don't know.
She takes a 5 and a half hockey skate.
I don't know.
She's a 12-year-old girI's size.
I take it this is her first foundation garment?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, right.
Mine too.
I mean, it's the first time I ever bought a- A foundation garment.
I got it.
This is our most popular pre-teen modeI.
This is?
Looks like a surgicaI bandage.
Does your daughter need something larger?
No.
If you ask me, my daughter doesn't need anything.
Unless you've got something that'll help her catch a football.
This one's very popular with the Green Bay Packers.
Here's a pretty one with a little pink bow.
No, no, no.
It's too fancy.
I don't like that stuff.
But you're not buying it for yourself, are you?
You're thinking like a man and you should be thinking like a 12-year-old girI.
I'm having a hard time thinking like a 30-year-old father.
Next time you should bring your daughter with you.
That's what all the other single fathers do.
Tell you what, this one will be fine.
An excellent choice.
It's the one I started out in.
- Would you like a bag?
- No, no, no.
- I just want to get out of here.
- Are you sure?
I think I will take a bag.
Thank you very much.
It's very nice of you.
See you.
You're doing a great job, sweetheart.
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, Dad.
Long time since we talked, huh?
We talked this morning, remember?
You asked me how I wanted my eggs - and I said, "over-easy.
" - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
That was great.
That was great.
I mean "talk" talk.
When people reach a certain age, honey they begin to- They begin to have trouble catching footballs.
Well Well, not all people.
Just girls.
No, women.
Women.
Here.
I knew it.
I knew she didn't want one of those.
I knew it.
Well, no, I wanted one like Marcie's, with the little pink bow in the middle.
- You wanted the pink bow?
Why?
- Because everyone's gonna see it.
Hey, who's gonna see it?
Everyone.
All the girls at gym class and at the slumber parties.
Dad, you just don't understand.
You have to have the little pink bow.
All right, look, I'll go someplace else, and I'll get you one with the bow.
Why not just take that one back to where you got it?
Oh, no, no, no.
We'll go someplace else.
But this time, you gotta go with me.
Dad Remember- Remember when we went shopping for hockey skates?
Yeah.
That was fun because you know a lot about hockey skates.
I mean, you even wear them yourself, right?
Yeah.
I'll bet Angela doesn't know a thing about hockey skates.
- You want Angela to take you, huh?
- Thanks, Dad.
You're the best.
At almost everything.
You gotta break this in reaI good.
Sam's gonna love this glove.
Oh, boy.
Sam keeps asking about what you got her for her birthday.
- You didn't tell her, did you?
- I didn't tell her.
That's my boy, my tiger.
- I didn't know untiI now.
- Wise guy.
Oh, it's them!
Hi.
We had the best time.
We picked up Mother, we all went into the city.
We went to Bloomingdale's.
We went to lunch- - Did you get a bra?
- Yeah, and so did Samantha.
Angela, I owe you.
I really owe you.
I appreciate this.
When Jonathan's ready to go to mud wrestling, I'm your man.
Well, thank you.
I'll keep it in mind.
Okay.
Is everybody here?
Is everybody ready?
- What's going on?
- Come on, Tony, sit down.
- Come on, sit down.
- Ready?
Now: That's Sam in that dress.
Isn't she gorgeous?
Don't you like it, Dad?
You look so grown up.
Oh, she looks beautifuI.
Come on, Sam, let's go up and take that dress off.
We don't want any wrinkles before the birthday party.
Thank you, Mrs. B- Angela.
- Grandma, did you get me something?
- Well, of course I did.
Clothes or good stuff?
Clothes.
Be gratefuI.
How could you do that to her?
She wanted you to love that dress.
It's a great dress, but you got the wrong kid in it.
Tony, don't spoiI it for her.
She looks so beautifuI, and she's so proud of herself.
Angela, that's not my Sam up there.
What did you do to my little girI?
Tony, I feeI as though I should be apologizing but I'm not sure for what.
Sam's too young for them fancy clothes you bought.
Well, she's not gonna play Little League forever.
That's fine.
But that dress is going back.
You can't take that dress back.
That's my birthday gift to her.
Fine.
Fine.
You bought her a birthday gift, huh?
Fine.
You bought her a dress.
Fine.
And a robe.
Some shoes.
And a little purse.
I couldn't resist it.
And inside, it had a lipstick and a perfume.
You're turning her into Joan Collins.
Tony, I think you're overreacting just a little.
Oh, no, I'm not.
I saw all the eye gunk you put on her.
It's just a little eyeliner for fun.
Tony, I've never been shopping with a little girI before.
- Maybe I got carried away.
- Yeah, maybe you did.
You tried to turn my Samantha into a woman overnight.
I'm not turning her into a woman, nature is.
Yeah, well, nature didn't take her to Bloomingdale's.
And nature didn't dress her up like little Miss Connecticut.
What's wrong with that?
Isn't that why you brought her here?
So she could have those things?
Angela, I don't think Jonathan is in love with his monogrammed handkerchiefs.
He's making little parachutes out of them.
For his hamster.
Angela, I know you meant well with those clothes - but they're all going back.
- Going back?
Wait a minute, Tony.
You can't do that.
You're going to break her heart.
Hey, listen, the two of you, that's my daughter up there and I know her better than both of you put together.
So she's being reaI polite about this but that just ain't her up there, all right?
A lot of parents just can't let their kids grow up.
- Sam, honey?
- Dad!
- What's the matter?
- I'm trying on my new clothes and I'm not fully dressed.
Want me to help with some of your zippers?
No.
I can do it myself.
Okay.
Did you want to see me?
I just came up to tuck you in.
Really, Dad, I'm getting too old to be tucked in.
- What do you think?
- It's nice.
Nice?
I love it.
Look, look, look.
You have to wash this in the delicate cycle.
I'm glad you pointed that out.
I might have spun-dry it.
Gee, I- I guess you're really growing up, huh?
Well, I'll be 12 tomorrow.
I mean, we're talking full price at the movies.
Then we're talking half as many movies.
- I'll still kiss you good night.
- I'll take what I can get.
- Good night, Dad.
- Good night, baby.
Tony baked Sam the most beautifuI birthday cake.
Isn't that great?
Well, you're the advertising biggie now, Angela.
I want you to think of something witty, poignant and clever to let this little girI know how we really feeI about her.
How about " Happy Birthday, Sam"?
You know it's not easy admitting you were wrong.
Are you saying you were wrong?
No.
But I might not have been as right as I thought I was.
What happened?
I go up to kiss Sam good night.
She tells me she's too old to be tucked in.
I mean, before you know it, she'll fall in love, she'll get married I'll dance " Daddy's Little GirI," and she'll be gone forever.
You're jumping the gun a little bit?
- She's not even interested in boys.
- Yet.
Just wait.
It's happening fast, man.
Oh, Tony, don't worry about it.
Really.
One minute they're all grown up and the next, they bounce right back to being a kid.
I remember when Angela was in the sixth grade- Mother, don't tell that story.
Look, Angela, I had the misery of raising you at least let me get a few laughs out of it, huh?
So Angela met this yo-yo named Lester Bundy.
Oh, Mother, he wasn't that bad.
He was kind of cute in his crossing guard uniform.
Well, anyway, she came home from schooI and she said to me that she was a woman in love and she gave away all of her dolls to the Salvation Army.
And then, old yo-yo Lester dumped her for a hot, little hall monitor.
The tramp.
Well, anyway- Anyway, Mother went down to the Salvation Army and she got all my dolls back.
But not before they gave me a bowI of hot turkey soup and a sermon on the evils of muscateI.
Well, Mona, that's a great story.
It really cheered me up.
Yeah, I can see that.
And it embarrassed my daughter, so my work's done for the day.
Hello, mini-people.
- Hey, what are you two doing up?
- We're trying to hear birthday talk.
No, we're not.
We just want a glass of milk, don't we, Jonathan?
Get your milk and hit the road.
Let's hustle up.
- Get to bed.
- We're hustling.
After you, ladies.
Oh, she's a beauty.
She's a regular Brooke Shields.
I guess I gotta admit, she looks kind of cute in a robe.
Oh, and it had the cutest little pair of matching slippers.
Don't press your luck, Angela.
Good night, Mother.
Thank you for everything.
- Good night, dear.
Good night, Tone.
- Good night, Mone.
Go.
Go.
Can you see it?
It's chocolate.
I win.
Let me taste it.
Oh, heaven.
Oh, that's good.
You know what my father's getting me for my birthday, don't you?
Yeah.
But I can't tell.
Is it a car?
No.
Is it an airplane?
No.
Is it a second baseman's glove?
It is!
It is!
All right!
That's what I wanted more than anything!
Oh, I'm so happy!
She got me again.
I better face it.
The next couple of years, they're gonna be tough.
I know.
It's not easy raising them alone, is it?
Sure, what do I know about raising a-?
A young lady.
I mean, you know, I know the streets of Brooklyn second base, and all six uses for Easy-Off.
That's it.
- Come on, you know your daughter.
- I'm not so sure, Angela.
I'm the one who bought her a baseball glove for her birthday.
I can't give her that now.
I gotta give her something that shows her I understand she's growing up.
Tony, that's a wonderfuI idea.
I could use some help from somebody who knows about these things somebody who gave up everything for a crossing guard.
Well, since you asked, I've been thinking about it.
What about a beautifuI necklace to go with the clothes?
- ReaI grown up, huh?
- Yeah.
- I'll take back the glove.
- I'm proud of you, Tony.
You're gonna make it through puberty after all.
And I thought the first time was tough.
- Here, Sam, this one's from me.
- Lollypop.
Oh, thank you, Jonathan.
Oh, look, everybody Reptile Weekly.
Thank you, Jonathan.
Oh, gosh, that's nice, huh?
And look here.
" If you renew your subscription now you will receive a free alligator.
" It'll be here Wednesday.
WonderfuI.
Well, Sam, I guess that's it for presents.
Oh, come on, Dad.
There might just be one more.
Where are you hiding it?
Here it is, honey.
Happy birthday, sweetheart.
I hope you like it.
Angela helped me pick it out.
You know, it's to wear with all them fancy clothes you got.
Hey, easy there.
- Isn't that beautifuI?
- Thanks, Dad.
Tony, where's the reaI present?
You have something else for me?
You want something else?
If it's the something else I think it is.
I think you're getting two presents, Sam.
- Which hand?
Which hand?
- Give me it!
Give me it!
My new mitt!
Thanks, Dad!
You're welcome, tiger.
She likes it.
She likes it!
Nothing will get by me now.
- I thought you took the mitt back.
- I couldn't.
I already oiled it.
All right, all right.
All right.
It's a fly ball to the second baseman Micelli.
And She makes the play.
Three outs!
We win the series.
And I get the best-dressed second baseman in the majors.
I love you.
- It's great out there.
- Yeah.
That looks good.
It is good.
Would you please get your hand out of my salad?
Please.
Dad, this new mitt is really great.
Me and the guys had a fantastic game.
- Yeah, did you win?
- No, we lost 12-2.
So, what's so fantastic?
- I'll get that.
- I'll get it.
It's for me.
Hello.
Hi, Bobby.
Oh, sure, I'll help you with your fielding.
Okay.
All right.
Bye.
He's a klutz, but he is so cute!
Here, eat salad.
Hey, who's this Bobby?
Bring him around.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Simply because you're near me Funny But when you're near me I'm in the mood for love Oh, well, if you can flambe a duck Hey, Mona, I'm back.
Kids okay?
Never better.
They're sound asleep.
Hey, look at this place, huh?
ReaI romantic.
You babysitters are all alike.
Trying to sneak in your boyfriend, huh?
No such luck.
This is all for Angela and Jeffrey.
Oh, that's that lawyer she's been drooling over, huh?
I want to make sure when he brings her home tonight that he doesn't get any wrong ideas, like leaving.
Well, I think you've got it covered.
I mean, brandy, candles, firelight.
If this guy don't get the picture, his shutter's not cocked.
Well, now all they need is a little privacy.
What are you doing home?
Yeah, well, I went down to Brooklyn to see my friends, you know.
But it's just not the same.
I'm like an outsider there now.
Here, come on.
This will cheer you up.
I don't know.
I don't even know what's going on down there anymore.
Anita Camici is three months' pregnant, I just found out about it.
- Well, that's wonderfuI, a baby.
- Yeah, yeah.
So the guys were taking bets on who the father was, you know?
I'm so out of it, I had to bet on the husband.
Jeffrey, this evening was wonderfuI.
Dinner and dancing.
I don't remember the last time I played miniature golf in an evening gown.
I'm just sorry the water slide was closed.
Come on.
- To the baby.
- To the baby.
Mother, Tony, is there something you two need to tell me about?
Okay, this is your mother there.
- No, this is for you.
- Thank you.
Oh, boy, I'm beat.
Got to get to bed.
I'm tired.
- Good night.
- Wait a minute.
Wait.
Time out.
Who is this guy?
Jeffrey, this is my housekeeper.
Tony.
- How you doing?
- And my mother, Mona Robinson.
Hello.
This is for you.
Oh, boy, I'm beat.
Well, time to go to bed.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Tony.
Tony Micelli.
Good guess.
- I know you?
- St. Louis, 1981.
It was a long year.
Could you help me out?
No, no.
We never met.
You played with the Cardinals for two months, second base number 14.
- You remember that?
- Sure, you came up in June.
- You batted.
204.
- You remember that too.
It would have been.
304, if it wasn't for that bum shoulder.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
You didn't say you had a housekeeper who played with the Cards.
I was waiting for just the right moment.
This is fantastic!
I have seen this guy play.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Remember the second game in the L.A. series?
Are you kidding?
There I was at the plate.
- Dodger Stadium, 50,000 fans.
- Fifty-six thousand.
- He hit one so far out of there- - Wanna see the ball?
- You're kidding.
You got the ball?
- You bet your life.
Upstairs.
You mind?
Two minutes.
I don't believe this.
How did you get the ball back?
I had to date the old lady who caught it.
Isn't he amazing?
He knows wine, he knows opera.
He even knows Tony.
He must be terrific at TriviaI Pursuit.
Well, what do you think?
Do you like him?
He's perfect.
He's just what Tony needs.
Excuse me?
Well, you see, Tony's losing all of his old pals in Brooklyn so maybe Jeffrey can be his paI in Connecticut.
Well, sure.
Why not?
You know, Jeffrey makes friends wherever we go.
He's on a first-name basis with the pretzeI man at Lincoln Centre.
- Now, that's clout.
- Oh, this will be great.
He'll come over, and he'll see Tony.
Then he'll see me.
Then he'll see more of me.
I'll be the only woman on the block who shares her man with her housekeeper.
No, Diane Wilmington does, only she doesn't know it.
Charlie Wilmington and Phoebe?
Didn't I hear the doorbell?
No, he's not here yet, Angela.
Do me a favour.
Put your hands up, just like that.
- All right, perfect.
- What is it?
What-?
It's good!
We had such a great time at the Jets game.
Boy.
- Angela, you found us one great guy.
- I sure did, didn't I?
He's fun, he's spontaneous, he's warm, he's thoughtfuI.
Yeah, he's got mid-court seats for the Knicks.
He's got 40-yard-line seats for the Jets.
He's got VIP parking at Shea Stadium.
I know, that's what first turned me on.
Hey, did he take you to Scottie's Sports Saloon yet?
No, did he take you to Tavern on the Green?
- No.
- Good.
You're gonna love Scottie's.
You should have seen the action there last night: The Jets, the Raiders, and a chick named Able MabeI.
- I'll get that- - That must be Jeff.
I'll get- Hi- Mother, it's you.
- Nice to see you too.
- She didn't mean it Mona.
We were ex- I mean, she was expecting Jeff.
Do you mean to tell me that you would rather go out with a rich, successfuI, handsome young lawyer than join your mother and two rowdy kids for root beer and rides at Pizza Playland?
Every time.
- Great.
I raised you right.
Right?
- Right.
- So where's he taking you?
- I don't know.
- I'm sure it'll be someplace fun.
- Le Chardonnay, corner booth.
You're gonna be up on the balcony.
You'll love it.
So much for surprises.
Well, anyway, you'll know what to wear.
I'm wearing what I'm going to wear.
Well, in that case, you look nice, dear.
Yeah, yeah.
Angela, you look reaI nice but how about your black blouse?
- Well, what's wrong with this?
- Nothing.
It's reaI nice.
It's just that Jeff likes you in black.
Is there anything else that Jeff likes that you'd like to tell me about?
Yeah, but that's between the two of you.
Tony!
The kids.
- Hi, Grandma!
- It's Mickey and Minnie.
- Here we go.
- Pizza Playland, here we come.
I'll say.
Tony, don't you want to go with us?
No, no.
I'm gonna go down to Scottie's and watch the Knicks beat the Sixers.
Dad, wake up and smell the coffee.
Dr. J's going to run us off the court.
Samantha, you're my daughter and I love you, but don't you ever say that.
Hey, there's always hope.
Have a good time.
- Okay, bye.
- Okay, troops, let's go.
Hup, two, three, four.
Hup, two, three, four.
So you gonna wear the black blouse?
Just go watch your football game.
It's the Knicks, Angela.
It's basketball.
Oh, Angela, by the way, don't mess with your hair.
He likes it that way.
- and travelling is called.
Travelling?
Are you kidding?
Did you see that call?
Come on, defence!
Hey, buddy, wake up and smell the coffee.
Dr. J's running us off the court.
- Hey, Jeff!
- Jeffrey!
- Hi.
- Jeffrey!
- What did I tell you?
- You're right.
This place really is something.
Oh, no, I forgot it was hat night.
- Here.
It's okay, I'll lend you mine.
- Thanks.
Thanks.
Now I get my first three hot dogs free.
Come on.
Hey, Tony.
Oh, Jeff, that's you.
Hey, nice hat.
Don't you have one just like that?
I didn't expect to see you guys here.
- How was dinner?
- It was wonderfuI.
We were on our way to Eastport for dessert.
The car's radio broke down.
- I wanted to check the game's score.
-98-62, Philly.
You're kidding.
Cartwright, come on!
Get the rebound!
Wait.
No, no, no.
No, I promised.
I promised Angela I would not get involved.
That's okay.
I have to check my service anyway.
- Is there a phone?
- Yeah, right over there.
- Excuse me.
- " Check my service"?
They used to just say " powder my nose.
" - Hi, Jeff.
How's it going?
- Well, can't complain, Sally.
Sally, huh?
Can I get you something?
I don't know.
What do you got in mind?
She's got beer in mind, and you've got a date.
- Hi, I'm Tony Micelli.
- I'm off Wednesday night.
- You are?
- I'll call you.
I'll answer.
All right, Grunfeld, come on!
Come on.
Buddy, they're coming back.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hey, buddy.
Buddy.
- What?
- What was that all about?
What?
- What what?
That.
- What, Sally?
Yeah, Sally.
What happened to Angela?
What about Angela?
She's fabulous.
I know.
So, what are you making dates with the waitress for?
What do you mean?
I like Angela, Tony but we're not married, you know?
I mean, she can go out with other guys, right?
Well, sure.
Hey, and she does too, lots of them.
Doctors.
Hey, you know, she's got a friend who is as cute as she is if, you know, you're interested.
Yeah?
But what happens if Angela finds out?
- What?
She doesn't let you date?
- Not me, you.
What if she finds out?
I mean, I'm not gonna go out of my way to tell her.
No messages.
- Well, I have got a message for you.
- Yeah?
Jeffrey.
Oh, you're terrible.
- And I mean it.
- Good.
I'll go get the car.
I'll see you later, Tony.
Yeah, Jeff.
- Hey, Angela.
- Yeah?
You know, I don't know what Jeff just whispered in your ear- Good, and you're not going to find out.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
But here's the thing- Tony, I think I'm falling in love.
Jeffrey, I don't know what it is about you but you always make me feeI so speciaI.
Good.
Because you are speciaI.
Excuse me.
Just taking out the garbage.
Tony, tonight is not garbage night.
I know, but I hate a cluttered kitchen.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
That Tony's a great guy.
Yeah, great.
Now, where were we?
Ah, yes.
I think I was speciaI.
Well, let's pick it up right from there.
Oh, my God.
It's unbelievable, huh?
Every place I go.
I'm sorry.
Well, I'm all finished with the garbage.
- Thank you.
- This is good night.
- I guess so.
Good night, Tony.
- Good night, Angela.
- Good night, Jeff.
- Night, Tony.
- Good night, Angela.
- No.
Not you, just him.
I'm sorry.
I've got a big case on Monday.
I've got to get up tomorrow, work early.
It's gonna take all day?
Don't forget.
Scottie's.
Big game tomorrow.
Green Bay versus Jets.
- Sounds great.
- Okay.
I'll call you.
Soon.
Thanks a lot, Tony.
For what?
The garbage?
That's my job.
No problem.
You know what I mean.
Jeffrey is a very busy man.
He has very little time for recreation and I would rather he recreate with me.
Well, now that you mentioned it maybe you should find somebody else to recreate with.
Maybe you should.
I want to be with Jeffrey, and I saw him first.
Hey, look- Angela, I just don't think you should get so hung up on this guy, Jeff.
Oh, I see what you're trying to do.
You're trying to break us up.
You're jealous of Jeffrey and me.
I'm jealous?
Hey, Angela, don't take this wrong but if you were thinking, like, me and you No, I'm not talking about me and you.
I'm talking about you and Jeffrey.
- What are you saying?
- No.
It's nothing like that.
You see, it's very simple.
You're losing your friends in Brooklyn and you're in need of male companionship and you're stealing my boyfriend to get it.
Very good, Dr. Brothers.
Angela, maybe this guy don't- He don't care about you as much as you think he does.
How dare you try to split us up?
I just don't think he's the right guy for you!
Jeffrey and I have something very speciaI and I'll thank you not to interfere.
You just keep your broken nose out of it!
It's a deviated septum.
- Hey, Tony.
- Hey, Jeffrey.
Tony, come on over.
How are you doing?
Hi, Sally.
How are you doing?
- Hi, Tony.
- Did I miss anything?
Yeah, just a goaI-line stand, fourth and inches and the first round of drinks.
Tony, this is Nanette.
It certainly is.
On T-shirt night, I do everything I read.
Oh, yeah.
You got a penciI?
It has to be on a T-shirt.
Well when are you going to explode?
As soon as somebody lights my fuse.
Forget the penciI.
You got a match?
Hi, Mother.
How nice to see you.
Come in.
Sit down.
Okay, Angela, what's wrong?
Nothing.
It's just I'm bored.
B- O-R-E-D.
Well, where is everybody?
Well, Samantha and Jonathan went to the movies with the Coopers and Tony and Jeffrey are at that place.
- Scottie's?
- Where else?
Then you are not bored, you're ticked off.
Well, why didn't you go with them?
If they'd wanted me to come, they'd have asked.
Angela, don't be an old poop.
They probably think that you don't like football.
- I don't like football.
- No, but you do like Jeffrey.
Are you saying I should pretend to like football - in order to get closer to a man?
- It worked in high schooI, didn't it?
Mother, I'm not gonna fit in.
I don't even know the players' names.
Well, what do you think newspapers are for?
We're just going to- Oh, here.
We'll flip to the old sports page we'll make ourselves a crib sheet.
Ready?
Here we go.
- Pat Ryan, quarterback.
- Pat Ryan, quarterback.
Tom Coombs, tight end We're crazy Jets fans, and we don't care who knows it/ We want a touchdown, and this is how we shows it/ Go, Jets.
Go/ Look, Angela, T-shirts.
I thought you said everybody wore hats here.
Well, they did the other night.
Well, too bad, because I look dynamite in a T-shirt.
Well, at least we have the players' names.
That's right.
Here we are.
Let's go Gastineau.
Let's go, Gastineau/ Let's go, Gastineau/ Go, Jets/ See what I mean?
Oh, look, look.
- Come on, Ryan, throw the bomb.
- You can do it.
Catch it!
Catch it!
I hope this is a high-scoring game.
And it was nice meeting you, young lady.
I liked the game too.
- Wasn't it nice meeting them, Jeff?
- What?
- Jeff.
Jeff.
- What?
Angela.
How about those Jets?
- Mother, let's go.
- Angela, wait a minute.
Wait, wait, wait.
What's going on here?
Are you guys married?
No, no, no.
No, this is just a misunderstanding here.
Sally, right?
Just a minute.
- Angela.
- They're married.
- Come on, Sally, let's get out of here.
- No, no, Nanette.
Angela.
- Please, just let me explain.
- No, no, no.
That's okay.
No, you're a free man.
You don't have to explain your Sunday afternoons to me.
It's just that I thought that Well, I guess I was wrong.
What do you mean?
We just came down here to watch the game.
- Right, paI?
- Right.
Tony didn't tell me he was bringing two girls.
Right, paI?
- Hey, Jeff, wait a minute- - You never said that.
- Right, Tony?
- I didn't say that.
But, you know, I was- Just answer the questions.
No, I never said I was gonna bring two girls.
Your witness, dear.
Tony, did you bring those two girls?
Am I under oath?
Hey, listen, I'm sorry.
I- If it was anybody else but Angela, I'd back you up.
But I can't, for her.
I can't.
Angela, Angela.
Okay, I met her here, but she means nothing to me.
- And I do?
- Yes.
Didn't I tell you you were speciaI?
Yes.
And I believed you.
Mother, I think the verdict is in.
Yes, and I think you just lost the case, counsellor.
Hey, I got caught with an honest witness.
Angela being with you You really are terrific.
Right.
Hey, Angela, I'm sorry.
Oh, it's not your fault.
You tried to tell me.
I just wouldn't listen.
Sorry you lost your friend.
So, what's so speciaI about him anyway?
Yeah.
You take away his winning personality his season tickets, his VIP parking and Nanette Then he's just another lawyer, rich, successfuI, good-looking.
Think we could catch him in the parking lot?
What a day, huh?
You lost a friend, and you lost a lover.
Oh, well, the night's young.
One of us has got to get lucky.
Hi, guys.
I'm Mona.
Mona/ Mona/ Let's go, Mona/ Yay, Mona!
Gee, this looks like fun.
Do you mind if I try?
Lady, listen, we're playing for money here.
Wait a minute.
Wait.
I've got money.
I've got twenty dollars.
Is that enough?
Rack 'em up.
Oh, I see.
You leave the money here and then whoever wins gets to keep it?
That's right, ma'am.
- Here, you go first.
- All right.
- Here, big guy.
Hold my coat for me?
- Allow me.
Okay, there we are.
- Here?
- Yes.
- Okay.
Like this?
- That's it.
Okay, here?
Bank the six ball and sink it back home.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Isn't this great?
It's the perfect time of the year for a barbecue.
This is what you call invigorating.
It's what you call stupid.
It's freezing.
- Hey, Tony, the buns are frozen.
- So are mine.
Hello, hello.
I'm home.
Are you all crazy?
It's freezing out here.
Well, don't tell us.
Tell Nanook.
Come on.
Let's go back into the igloo.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
You'll leave me to finish the barbecue all alone.
No problem.
We'll stay where we are.
- I'll get it!
- I'll get it!
Oh, he beat us.
- We're here.
- We're here.
We're staying right here with you.
- Oh, hello.
- Hi.
Is your mom at home?
Well, would you mind going to get her for me?
I'm a vice-president of Wallace and McQuade.
That's nothing.
My mom's president.
Yeah, I know.
Would you just tell her that Jim Peterson is here?
Oh, I've heard of you.
Do you really bite people's backs?
Jim, what a pleasant surprise.
Sweetheart, why don't you go out and help Tony.
Okay.
- Cute kid.
- Thank you.
But, Jim, what are you doing here?
Well, I was just on my way home and I thought that you might like to see the market research we did on the Mortonson account.
How thoughtfuI.
Besides if I'd sneaked out early like you did I'd have missed hearing the big news.
Well, see you.
- Hold it, Jim.
- Yeah?
What big news are we talking about?
Oh, you know, your friend, Grant, is leaving and there's a new chairman of the board coming in.
- Grant is leaving?
- You didn't know?
Where did you hear this?
I don't think I can tell you that.
Ah, yes, the executive men's room.
Who said it?
I don't know.
Some guy wearing penny loafers.
Now, there's a source.
I'll get that.
Jim, what you heard was just a washroom rumour.
I can assure you if Grant were leaving I'd be the first person to hear about it.
Angela, it's for you.
It's Grant.
Excuse me.
Oh, hi.
Hi.
I don't think we've met.
I'm Jim Peterson, vice president.
- Tony Micelli, housekeeper.
- Housekeeper.
Is that what they're calling it these days?
Are you saying what I think you're saying?
No, no, no.
Absolutely not.
Grant is leaving.
Yeah?
So, what's that mean?
Grant appointed me president.
Some new board chairman could un-appoint me.
And Jim Peterson came all the way over here just to rub your nose in it, huh?
He bites backs, rubs noses.
What a weirdo.
Jonathan, you're so literaI.
Well, he's been on my case since I was appointed president and he wasn't.
This guy sounds like bad news.
Why don't you throw him out?
Tony, you can't fire a man just because he's ambitious.
Who said anything about firing?
I said, throw him out.
Tony, you don't understand.
This is business.
Jim Peterson is a vice president.
Now, he's entitled to some respect, even if he is slime.
- I think you can handle this turkey.
- I don't know.
He's gonna do everything he can to get in with this new guy.
He's reaI good at being one of the boys.
Drinks Scotch, talks sports.
He knows all the dirty jokes.
- Well, I can help you there.
- Mother.
I just wish there was some way I could get to this new guy first.
Why don't you invite him over here for some party or something.
Show him what kind of class act you are.
An officiaI welcome party.
I like it.
I'll invite all the vice presidents.
- Except for that bum, Peterson.
- Oh, no, no.
I'd have to invite him too.
Well, except he's going to Buffalo for some family thing.
Oh, yeah, when?
Next Sunday.
The night of my party.
All right, all right.
Come on, let's get this barbecue on the road.
- All right.
Hey, look at this.
- Come on.
Who said this ain't a great time of year for a barbecue?
Are you kidding me?
Excuse me.
I got it.
So, Angela, where's this loser you fixed me up with tonight?
Mother, Harold Sternman is not a loser.
- I got it.
- His wife just died.
He's nice.
He's the best vice president the accounting department has seen in a long time.
Oh, great, so I'm gonna have a wonderfuI evening making small talk with a bereaved accountant.
Mother, that's him.
Come on.
Harold, hi.
I'd like you to meet my mother, Mona Robinson.
Well, how do you do?
Getting better all the time, thanks.
If you had told me your mother was such a fox I would not have been so fashionably late.
Oh, speaking of late, I am so sorry about your loss.
These things happen.
- Would you like a drink?
- I'd love a drink, Harold.
The bar is right over here.
- I got, I got.
- That's gonna be them.
- How do I look?
- You look terrific, Angela.
Just like one of the guys.
Well, I mean reaI presidentiaI, you know.
Hello.
You must be the McKennas.
Hello, I'm Angela Bower.
- Please come in.
- How do you do?
- Can I take your coat?
- Thank you.
Okay.
This is nice.
I hope it doesn't eat much.
It was so nice of you to have this little party for us.
Yes, Angela, very thoughtfuI.
We wanted you to feeI welcome.
At Wallace and McQuade, we like to think of ourselves as one big happy family- Well, that's very nice.
Where is the hooch?
Well, hello again.
I'm your happy hooch man.
What'll it be?
White wine and Scotch.
And what for the lady?
- So I hear you're from Chicago.
- That's right.
Home of the Bears.
- Bears?
- The Bears, yeah.
You kidding?
They look good this year.
That Payton, he's having one hell of a year.
- At least that's what Angela says.
- One hell of a year.
I'll get that.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Would you like to meet the vice presidents?
Well, they're all here except for Jim Peterson.
Unfortunately, he couldn't- Mr. and Mrs. McKenna, what an honour.
Jim, I thought you had something else.
Just my parents' 50th anniversary.
I'll catch them next year.
Anyway, it's not like I was invited.
Hi.
Jim Peterson, executive vice president.
Mrs. McKenna, it's such a pleasure to meet the woman behind the great man.
You know, I've been a fan of yours ever since you did that storm-window campaign.
You remember that?
That was 12 years ago.
Well, I never forget a great jingle.
When the wind's in your face Snow's all over the place Just call Central Storm Window They're down in the nick They'll fix you up quick You'll never be freezing again When the wind's in your face Snow's all over the place Just call Central Storm Window C- E-N-T-R-A-L Storm Window Legend.
Legend.
You know, he majored in music.
Let me guess - Princeton?
- Remarkable.
Oh, just a shot in the dark.
Say, you wouldn't happen to play handball.
Don't bet on it, Jim.
McKenna's the name, handball's the game.
I'll be darned.
Ms. Bower, can I trouble you for a minute?
- Not now, Tony.
- I think this is the right time.
Will you excuse me?
What's wrong?
A problem in the kitchen?
- No, you're blowing it out here.
- Beg your pardon?
You're letting this Peterson take over.
I can hold my own with him, thank you very much.
Green Bay is washed up.
The team's gonna have to rebuild.
- What do I say?
- Say the Jets are looking good.
Ryan's threading needles, and Ramsey's kicking us to the Super BowI.
I really don't know that much about the AFC.
The Jets look good.
Ryan's threading needles and Ramsey's kicking us straight to the Super BowI.
You don't say.
What do you think about New England?
Oh, it's beautifuI this time of year.
He puts on his glasses, looks around and says, "Who's next"?
- What will it be?
Same thing?
- Yeah, might as well celebrate.
My day is finally dawning.
With Angela's free ride leaving the company I think the board of directors, under McKenna - will finally come to their senses.
- Wait.
What do you mean "free ride"?
- Angela earned her position.
- I don't doubt that at all.
I just wonder what she had to do for Grant to earn it.
Well, I mean, it's common knowledge.
And you hung that tulip paper in the bathroom yourself?
- I did.
I did.
It's very simple- - Lovely tour.
Now, where is that Peterson fellow?
- Ladies and gentlemen, a toast to- - That's it.
Let's go.
- Come on, paI, let's go.
- Wait.
Wait a minute.
Do you have any idea who I am?
I am vice president of Wallace and McQuade!
- Party's over.
- Vice president!
To absent friends.
You know, that looked like Jim Peterson - getting thrown out of here.
- Oh, my God.
- Tony!
Tony, what are you doing?
- I'm throwing out the garbage.
How could you do such a thing?
!
Jim?
Jim?
Jim.
Tony, I demand an explanation.
- And I demand an apology!
- You forget about it.
- You ain't getting one.
- I'd like to know what's going on.
Jim, you must have said something to this man to get thrown out the door.
It was just a little disagreement over football.
Angela, that's not true.
Is he calling me a liar?
No, no, no.
That's not what he meant.
Is it, Tony?
Well, then you tell us, Tony, what was the disagreement about?
It was about football, just like he said.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry.
Excuse me.
Jim, I I think I'll call it a night.
Thank you, Mrs. Bower, for a very interesting evening.
Lovely wallpaper, really.
Yeah, I'll walk you to the car.
And tell Tony I can find the door myself.
Well Wait a minute.
- Robin- - Sorry, I can't stay.
- Angela, lovely party.
- Robert.
Ted.
No, wait.
Stay.
I have cake!
Give it up, Angela.
Listen, this whole thing will probably blow over.
Yeah, sure.
Just chalk it up to experience, Angela.
I've given parties that were a flop before.
Of course, nothing quite like this, but - Thank you, Mother.
- Come on, Harold let's go catch the Rocky Horror Picture Show.
Oh, boy, and I've got my garter belt out in the car.
Good night, dear.
Good night.
It was a lovely party.
Good night.
You.
Hi, Angela.
Hey, you want some cake?
We got plenty.
How dare you destroy my party and humiliate me in front of McKenna and all because of some stupid argument over football!
I wouldn't throw nobody out over football.
- Basketball?
Hockey?
- Hockey, maybe.
But you don't know what he said.
- Tell me what he said.
- I can't tell you what he said.
In this entire universe, there's only one person I have ever told you not to throw out, and you go and throw him out!
That's some coincidence, huh?
I am pulling rank.
This is your employer speaking.
I want you to tell me what he said.
All right.
He said you were a two-bit tramp.
You slept your way to the top, and you do your best work in the sack.
- He said that?
- Yeah, and then he got nasty.
All right, egg fans.
- It is now chow time.
- All right.
- You ready?
- Yeah.
- All right.
- These eggs look yucky.
Do I have to eat them?
No, no, no.
Don't eat them.
No, no.
Eat these.
Tricky, isn't he?
- Anybody home?
- Hey, Mona.
You want some breakfast?
No, I don't want breakfast.
I want gossip.
What happened?
Where are you working next week?
Well, it's not that bad, but she was really mad last night.
Well, can you blame her?
I mean, you do take football seriously.
But as far as I'm concerned, Tony, your team is my team.
Where is she?
She hasn't come down yet.
She hasn't come down yet?
It's 7:30.
She's gonna miss her train.
Jonathan those eggs look yucky.
Yeah, I'm glad they aren't mine.
- Angela?
- Go away.
- What?
- Go away.
Are you all right?
Are you all right?
I said, go away.
What are you doing?
You're gonna be late.
I'm not going to work.
I'm sick.
My head hurts, my throat hurts, my nose is running, and I want my mother.
Here I am, dear.
Here I am.
You want me to make you some nice tapioca pudding?
Yeah.
You don't have much fever.
Look at that.
But I didn't leave it in long enough.
I'm burning up.
FeeI me.
- Who, me?
- Don't you have things to do?
Like getting the kids off to schooI and looking for another job?
- Come on, Angela.
- Don't pay any attention to her.
Now, Angela, you know what's wrong with you.
You're upset because your party was a flop and you were embarrassed in front of the vice presidents.
You don't want to go in and face them.
And who can blame you?
You think this nose is psychosomatic?
I got this dumb cold from Tony's Antarctic barbecue.
Come on, Angela, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I ruined your party.
You ruined my party, you ruined my career, you ruined my life.
At least you have your health.
Gesundheit.
I'm gonna- I've got some- I'm gonna go.
Jonathan, today after schooI, I'll teach you how to throw a perfect spiraI.
Really?
Why?
Because I like you.
If you happen to bump into your mom, give her a message for me.
- What?
- Tell her not to fire my Dad.
You guys ready for the schooI bus?
- Yep.
- No.
I have to brush my teeth.
The kid's overtrained, Dad.
- Honey, lemon, and garlic?
- Yeah.
- Who's sick?
- Angela, and it's my fault.
What happened?
Last night, some guy gets out of hand at the party, right, so I do what I think is right.
I know you're going to find this hard to believe, Sam but your father screwed up.
Oh, Dad, don't worry about it.
I do it all the time.
And I'm gonna tell you the same thing you tell me.
- Yeah, what?
- Young lady you march up there and apologize.
It's a good call.
But I did that already and I don't think apologizing is going to help with this Peterson guy.
So maybe you should apologize to him.
Don't you have to brush your teeth, Sam?
Okay, I get it.
Butt out.
I'm just the kid around here.
No, no.
Wait a minute.
Sit down.
Sit down.
I'm listening.
I'm just not sure I'm buying.
See, let me tell you.
This guy Peterson said a lot of creepy things.
- So why should I apologize to him?
- Well, Dad, I really like it here.
Let's face it, you're on thin ice.
Yeah, well, I wouldn't do it just to save my taiI.
But what about Angela's taiI?
- You're right.
- I know.
You're tough, but you're right.
Thanks, Sam.
You really helped me straighten this one out.
That's why you pay me the big allowance.
She's so cute.
I love that kid.
Let's see.
Let's put some garlic in this, yeah.
One Here we go, sweet-ums.
This is Tony's homemade cold remedy.
Come on.
Honey, lemon garlic.
He's trying to kill me.
He couldn't embarrass me to death, so he's using Italian voodoo.
Come on now, Angela.
Come on.
You can't stay underneath there forever.
Can too!
Like I told you on the day you were born eventually, kid, you gotta come out.
Come on, you gotta come out and face the world, huh?
Or at least Jim Peterson.
Mother?
Do you know what that man said about me?
Well let mommy guess.
He said you were a two-bit tramp, you slept your way to the top and you do your best work in the sack.
Who told you that?
Well, unfortunately, that's what a lot of men say about women that are more successfuI than they are.
He thinks that the only reason I was promoted to president is because Grant and I were Well, you know, "friends.
" - Well, is that true?
- No.
And, see, that's what I was afraid of.
So we weren't "friends.
" We were just friends.
UntiI I got the job.
Then we were "friends.
" But Peterson's making it sound like we were always "friends.
" Well Let me ask you something, Angela.
What?
Are you a good president?
I think I am, Mother.
I really do.
Well, I know you are, and Grant knows you are and the entire board of directors agreed with him.
And you weren't "friends" with all of them.
- Were you?
- Mother!
Come on, Angela, get up.
Do you think Lee lacocca's mom has to tell him to get out of bed?
- Out!
- Mother!
No, get out.
No!
Get out of bed.
I'll get that, Angela.
You just keep sneezing.
Hi, Mr. Peterson.
Come on in.
Come on.
Come on, come on, come on.
I was told Mrs. Bower wants to see me.
Well, she doesn't.
I do.
But I didn't think you'd come over for me.
- You're right.
- Well, wait a minute, now.
Come on.
Mr. Peterson, look, I want to apologize.
You do?
Well, it won't help.
Look, I know I was wrong.
I had no right to throw you out the other day.
Apology not accepted.
What do you want me to do, huh?
Kiss your feet in Macy's windows at 12 noon?
- Well - All right, okay.
Okay, I'll do it.
If it'll help Angela, I'll do it, man.
I'll beg.
The hell you will.
- Angela, I didn't see you there.
- I guess not.
Should you be coming down?
You sure you're strong enough?
You bet I'm strong enough.
I'm president of this company.
If you have any other ideas to the contrary, I'm warning you I'll give you a fight you'll never forget.
All right.
All right!
All right!
I knew that double dose of garlic would work.
And you can play handball with McKenna all you like but I have full authority to hire and fire at my discretion.
Do I make myself clear, Mr. Peterson?
Crystally.
Nice.
Anything else?
Yes, Jim, there is.
- You do good work.
- Thank you.
But if I hear one more word of smutty innuendo out of your mouth, you're history.
Okay?
- Okay.
- I think Tony can show you the door.
No, that's all right!
He showed me last time.
- Let me- - No, I remember.
No, no, come here.
Boy, that guy can really run.
You really told him what for.
- That was more fun than tossing him.
- Yeah, it sure was.
Warm up the Batmobile, Robin.
I'm going to work.
Holy garlic breath, Angela.
Wait a minute.
Maybe you should wait another day.
And while you're at it could you call me up on the phone?
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Okay, here we go, guys.
AnimaI pancakes.
See?
Mine's a horse.
- What did I get?
- You got a shark.
See, just when you thought it was safe to go back into the kitchen.
Tony, it's almost time to take me to the station.
Angela, I can't.
My aerobics group is coming today.
You always drive yourself on Tuesdays.
I forgot and I made plans to have the Jaguar painted.
Is the station wagon finished yet?
No.
I still got all the tires off, and I'm giving it a lube job.
I do not see why we cannot let them do that down at the garage.
Angela, you don't get your best money value at a place called Giorgio's Auto Boutique.
That guy charges 20 bucks a spark plug.
I know, but he serves chilled Chablis while you wait.
Angela, this is a really important class.
Housekeepers around here, they can't afford fancy health clubs.
And anyway, after I'm finished with them they'll be lean, mean, cleaning machines.
Right.
And, Tony how does Mrs. Wilmington's maid look in a leotard?
Phoebe?
Not too shabby.
Good morning to you.
- Hey, Mona.
- Hey.
Hi, Mother.
- Can you give me a ride to the station?
- I'd be happy to, dear.
Wanna pedaI or sit on the handlebars?
- Where's your car?
- My car is down at Giorgio's getting the air changed in its tires.
You know, I hear that's great air.
It's imported from France.
Here.
Take my van.
Tony, I cannot show up at the station in a '67 van with a bumper sticker that says, " Hot to trot.
" Angela, take the van.
I don't have a choice if I wanna get the Jaguar painted.
- What colour are we painting it, Mom?
- Well, I don't know, sweetheart.
I was thinking maybe about light beige but then I thought maybe I'd go a little bolder with dark beige.
Don't lose your head, Angela.
Yeah.
Hey, Angela, why don't you do something hot, like red.
Yeah, red.
Like a fire engine.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I can see you now.
You're tooling down the Hutchinson River Parkway.
Your sunroof is down, your hair's flying in the wind the stereo's blasting.
- Really?
- Yeah, you know- You know, inside that conservative advertising executive I think there's a racy blonde trying to get out.
Light beige.
Just don't park it at the beach.
You'll never find it.
Come on, Mom.
Red will be fun.
- Red?
- Go for it, Angela.
Yeah, do something daring.
- All right.
- Oh, my God.
Sandalwood.
We've driven her over the edge, Mona.
She's run amok.
That's right, ladies, just like you vacuum.
Five, six, seven, eight.
Blood was made to circulate.
Doing good, Viv.
You're doing good.
Desiree, shake it but don't break it.
You're certainly holding your end up.
Phoebe, Phoebe.
Oh, baby.
All right, girls.
Okay, let's finish strong.
Like we're under the couch.
Get down now.
Vacuum under that couch.
Here we go.
One, two, three, four.
It's fun to suck lint from the floor.
Five, six, seven, eight.
Blood was meant to circulate.
One, two, three, four five, six Come on in, girls.
Make yourself at home.
Hey.
- The living room?
Really?
- Yeah.
- She lets you entertain in here?
- Of course.
I'm like one of the family.
You know, Angela and I are very close.
- Oh, I get it.
Like - Oh, hey.
Hey.
No.
You don't fooI around with your boss.
That's a cardinaI rule.
Hey, Micelli - this is just between us girls.
- Yeah?
- You must have some gripes, right?
- Yeah.
I got some gripes.
I mean, the Knicks don't look too good this year.
Hey, Tony, hasn't she ever called you on the phone right in the middle of General Hospital?
No.
I don't watch General Hospital.
And you call yourself a maid?
I call myself a housekeeper, ladies.
You'll find out.
She thinks of you as a maid.
No, no.
Not Angela.
I'm telling you, it's different.
- It's like we're friends.
- You're a maid just like the rest of us.
Cross her, and she'll let you know who's boss.
Oh, I'll get the door.
I got it, ladies.
- You're right.
- Thanks.
- Mr. Bower?
- Oh, no.
I'm Micelli.
I'm Mrs. Bower's I'm the man of the house.
Well, I'm the man from Eastport Paint and Body.
I'm here to pick up Mrs. Bower's Jaguar MX8266.
Are you sure you're authorized to release it?
Come on in.
It's right in the back drive.
I got the keys right here.
Here's the keys.
- Sign right here.
- All right.
Thanks.
Did she decide on a colour?
We have light beige 101, dark beige 102 or is she gonna bust out with sandalwood 103?
I think you better call her, Tony.
I don't have to call her, Viv.
We're gonna go with 1100.
Diablo red.
Yeah.
That's great, Tony.
Yeah, that's great.
Mother.
Mother.
No, no, Mother.
Mother, wake up.
- Sorry.
- You have a biology test tomorrow.
Okay, shoot.
What do they call it when an organism reproduces without sex?
Hardly worth the trouble.
Grandma, I'm selling candy bars for the Indian Guides.
Yeah, and the tribe that sells the most cases wins three days and two fun-filled nights in a teepee at Cockaponset State Forest.
Does that include the continentaI breakfast?
- Okay, I'll take one.
- Here you go.
One case, 20 bucks.
Twenty bucks?
That's highway robbery.
- I'll get it.
- Okay.
Well, don't look at me.
You fell for it.
Hi, Mrs. Wilmington.
Sorry about your rose bushes.
Why?
What happened?
Oh, never mind.
See you.
Hi, Diane.
- What's the problem?
- Angela, I don't want you to think that I just drop in to complain all the time.
Diane, she knows that's not true.
You missed Wednesday.
Well, I just wanna be a good neighbour.
Well, that's wonderfuI, Diane because Jonathan is selling candy for the Indian Guides.
- Would you like one?
- Oh, sure, I'll buy one.
Good.
Here.
One case, 25 bucks.
- Was there something else you wanted?
- Well, yes, now that you mention it.
My housekeeper, Phoebe, is dissatisfied.
Did you talk to Mr. Wilmington?
We know what the problem is.
It's all the housekeepers in the neighbourhood.
They feeI that you've given too many speciaI privileges to your live-in.
- Housekeeper.
- Whatever.
Did I say this chocolate was $25?
It's $30.
Diane, would you like a glass of sherry?
How much is it?
- It's on the house.
- Oh, sure.
Thanks.
You know, Angela, you're spoiling Tony and making it tough for the rest of us.
Well, I'm sorry you're having a problem with Phoebe, Diane - but that's not my fault- - No.
There is a fine line between an employer and an employee.
And once they step over it- Well, there's trouble.
Well, nobody is stepping over any lines here.
I'm sorry, Diane.
We seem to be out of sherry.
That's all right, dear.
Perhaps she would like a saucer of milk.
Hello, Mrs. Wilmington.
How are you?
- Tony, do we have any sherry?
- It's on the list.
Don't you remember?
We killed it while watching Rosemary's Baby.
- We?
- Oh, yeah.
Hey.
It's a scary movie.
You don't think I wanna see it alone.
Yes, well - How about a little chilled white wine?
- No, thanks.
I'm only kidding.
I'm only kidding.
Three white wines coming up.
In your face.
Oh, boy.
Oh, boy.
Oh, boy.
I can't wait till she comes home.
- I hope she's surprised.
- Don't worry, Dad.
She'll be surprised.
It's the reddest red I've ever seen in my life.
- Can we get a siren?
- Hey, Smoky, take it easy.
That's your mother's prized Jaguar, not some fire engine.
Hey, what a beautifuI car.
- You like it, Mona?
- I love that colour.
But what happened?
I mean, when I left here yesterday I could've sworn Angela was dead set against red.
- Is that how you saw it?
- Yeah.
I mean, how in the world did you talk her into it?
Well, there might be some talking left to do.
- You mean-?
- Yeah, Grandma.
It's a surprise.
- Yeah, it's a surprise.
- Oh, it's a surprise.
Yeah, a surprise.
Like GeneraI Custer planned for Sitting Bull?
Hey, Mona, you got this all wrong.
I mean, look.
She went from light beige to dark beige to sandalwood just like that.
From there, what is it?
A hop, skip and a jump to diablo red, right?
- I guess maybe you're right, Tony.
- I know I am.
And it is a terrific colour.
- It's awesome.
- She's gonna love it.
I can't wait to see her face.
Oh, Tony!
I've got some homework to do.
- Me too.
- Yeah, me too.
- In the backyard?
- Yeah.
Have a nice day at the office?
Tony, what can you tell me about the red Jaguar that's in the driveway with my license plates on it?
A little paint really picked that buggy up, huh?
I was hoping you could tell me the garage had made a horrendous mistake, which even now as we speak they are rushing over to rectify at no additionaI charge.
I could tell you that.
I could tell you that.
It wouldn't be the truth, but I could tell you- Angela, I wanted to say "sandalwood" but it just kind of came out " red.
" You told them to do this?
You were sort of intrigued with the idea, right?
Going down the parkway, the sunroof, the singing Chaka Khan on- I said sandalwood.
The colour of wood, or the colour of sandals.
- But not the colour of that.
- Well, maybe I could pay to have it- Fifteen hundred dollars.
You won't believe this, but it's gonna work perfect.
By the time I can afford it, you'll need a paint job.
Who do you think you are?
There is a line between employer and employee - and you just crossed over it.
- Hey, wait a minute.
No, you wait a minute.
I don't pay you to make decisions around here.
I pay you to do the damn floors.
You are just the maid and don't you forget it.
Okay, Tony.
I've calmed down.
I'm willing to listen if there's anything you wanna say to me.
Good evening, Mrs. Bower, ma'am.
What?
Dinner will be served momentarily.
- What are you doing?
- Just my job, ma'am.
Oh, I see.
And that's why you're wearing that getup.
Why are there only two places?
One for you, and one for Master Jonathan.
The hired help will eat in the kitchen where we belong.
Oh, come on, Tony.
Knock it off- No, no, Mrs. Bower.
When you're right, you're right.
We have to watch that line between employer and employee.
Allow me, madam.
Hi, stud.
Good evening, Mrs. Robinson.
This must be the place.
- May I take your wrap?
- My God.
It's the Invasion of the Body Snatchers.
What did you do with the guy that belongs in there?
I'm sorry, madam.
I'm just the maid.
I take it that the lady of the manor did not care for the colour of her carriage.
Mother, butt out.
This is between me and Jeeves.
- We're starving.
- Yeah, what's for dinner?
Well, you and your mum will be supping on prime rib of beef, Yorkshire pudding and baby peas.
We'll be having franks and beans in the kitchen.
Well, how come I can't have franks and beans?
Your station in life, sir.
This seems to me like a good night to take you both out for pizza.
- Yeah.
- Hey.
Why is it always the children that have to suffer?
Don't start that car without me.
The madam will be dining alone?
Okay, Tony.
Okay.
You've made your point.
- Can we just go back to normaI now?
- NormaI, ma'am?
You know, like you used to be.
You know.
" Hey, yo, whoa, hey.
" "A-O O-A"?
Anything else, madam?
Tony, if you don't stop this right now, I'm gonna kill you!
Dinner is served.
If you need anything: You rang?
Angela, how long is this going to go on?
There's nothing but silence and bell ringing around here.
It's like a Trappist monastery.
- Yes, madam?
- You may clear now.
- I hope the tea was to your liking.
- Thank you.
If there's nothing else, I'll repair to the garage for my workout.
Tony, if you're going to serve tea in that outfit perhaps you should shave under your arms.
Yes, mum.
Angela, how long are you going to go on playing Upstairs, Downstairs?
Well, you have to admit, the service is great.
- You are behaving like a child.
- Well, he started it.
What do you want me to do?
- Apologize to him.
- Me?
- He painted my car like a fire engine.
- I know.
Isn't it wonderfuI?
- He had no right to do what he did.
- You're right, he didn't.
But, look, a car is a hunk of metaI, and Tony is a person with feelings.
Of course, he's also a hunk.
He went too far.
And you didn't?
I didn't mean to.
Then why don't you go out there and talk to him.
- As always, you enjoy being- - Right.
Hi, Angela.
Here's the $30 for the candy.
Thanks, Diane.
We'll call off the collection agency.
- Oh, thanks, Diane.
Goodbye.
- Yes, well, thanks for dropping by.
Actually, now that I'm here I understand you're having a little domestic problem.
Nothing I can't handle.
Well, word on the street is Tony's just not happy with you anymore.
Well, I guess you pick up a lot walking the streets.
Diane, if Tony's not happy, he is free to leave.
- Oh, terrific.
Where can I find him?
- Cleveland.
Mother.
Tony is free to speak with whomever he wishes.
He is a grown man, more or less.
He's out in the garage.
Thanks, Angela.
Oh, and by the way, I love your car.
Angela, that woman is planning on using blatant sex appeaI on Tony.
Now, you have to get out there and fight fire with fire.
On second thought, maybe I'd better go.
Knock, knock.
Knock, knock.
Round one.
Hi, Mrs. Wilmington.
How you doing?
Mrs. Bower's in the house.
Oh, yeah, I know, but she told me I could find you out here.
Don't tell me you wanna join my aerobics class.
Well, no.
Actually, I just came from my exercise class.
Well, you certainly have some interesting equipment.
Likewise, I'm sure.
I mean, thanks.
You know, Tony, I understand you used to be a ball player.
Yeah, yeah- I- I played minor leagues in Tidewater, and I was traded to the Cubs.
To the Cards.
Well, you know, I've been thinking of a little trade myself.
- A trade?
What do you wanna trade?
- Phoebe, for you.
A trade?
Dead even?
No draft pick to be named later.
Tony, I'm serious.
I want you to come work for me.
Unless there's some arrangement keeping you here.
No, I'm a free agent.
But what happened to Phoebe?
- I thought you were so happy with her.
- Not as happy as my husband.
You know Phoebe.
She's a great maid.
She gives everything she's got.
Well, I think it might work out well for everyone involved.
I understand you're having a little problem with Angela.
Well, we went a couple of rounds, but I think it's gonna blow over.
- She said you were free to leave.
- She said that?
She didn't say that.
Hey, even if she said that, she didn't mean that.
She really said that?
She obviously doesn't appreciate you.
Why stay some place where there's so much tension?
It is getting a little tense around here, you know?
There are ways to relieve tension.
Lots of ways.
How many ways?
- Hello.
- Oh, hi, Angela.
Working up a little sweat, Diane?
Is there anything you wanted, Mrs. Bower, ma'am?
Yes, Tony, as a matter of fact there is.
If Mrs. Wilmington has come up with an offer that you somehow find attractive, I think you should go ahead and take it.
- You do?
- Absolutely.
See, Tony, I told you.
FeeI free to leave any time.
As soon as we settle up that $1500 for the paint job.
Well, gee, I told you, I ain't got that kind of money.
I You know, I have to work that off.
Could take years.
- Well, I've got to get my money.
- Yeah.
And this whole thing was my fault, so I guess I'll have to stay.
- I guess so.
- Oh, no.
That's nonsense.
- I can take care of that right now- - Oh, no.
Wait.
Thank you very much, Mrs. Wilmington, but nobody pays my way, you know?
- Guess we're stuck.
- I guess we are.
Sorry, Mrs. Wilmington.
So am I. Bye.
I wonder how many ways.
- What?
- Oh, nothing.
Nothing, Angela.
I'm so glad we dropped all that "ma'am" stuff.
Wait.
That's the way a proper maid should speak.
Tony, if I had wanted a proper maid, I would not have hired a headstrong opinionated pain in the neck like you.
Oh, easy, Angela you're getting me all misty here.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Hey, hey.
There's one thing I do have to get straight here, Angela.
You know, I do pay my own way and I'm gonna have that car of yours repainted any dull colour you'd like.
Well, Tony, I've decided that I'll live with it for a little while.
- You like the red.
- No, I didn't say I like it.
- You like the red.
- I just I said I'd live with it.
- Did I know you'd like it?
- Living with it and liking it- Here comes the racy blonde.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Mother.
How's the short story coming?
I can't think of anything to write about.
Well, write about life, or someone you know.
Observe something, Mother.
The sexy, sultry blond rose from the couch and slithered across the room.
Is it too late to drop the course?
Actually, she wasn't all that sexy.
She's wasn't all that sultry.
And it was even doubtfuI she was a blond.
Mother!
Oh, I know I'm late, I know I'm late, but I got all the errands done, and look.
I even got a wreath.
- That's terrific, but where's the-?
- Firewood?
I got the firewood.
- Firewood.
- Great, but what about-?
Dinner?
I got dinner.
- Chinese food.
- Children.
The children are gonna love this.
I forgot the kids!
I'm out of here.
Mother, do you think Tony's been acting peculiar?
Oh, Angela.
It's easy to forget the kids.
They're small.
Not just today.
He's been preoccupied all week.
He's out almost every night.
I had to plan my eggnog party around his schedule.
These are the times that try men's souls.
Here they are.
Kids.
He's forgetfuI, but he's fast.
We got a ride home with Mrs. McCarthy.
Yeah, I told her my dad didn't care about me anymore.
What are you talking about?
I got Chinese food, an order of ribs.
He cares, he cares.
Hey, listen, I can't stay for dinner.
I gotta go out.
Again?
Well, yeah.
It's Christmas time, right?
- Well, I know, but- - But tomorrow I'll stay home, I promise.
I'll make scampi a la Tony, the best.
I promise.
I need you to stay.
I have to go Christmas shopping.
- But, Angela- - Tony, I'll cover for you.
I love Chinese.
It's my only vice.
Well, at least it goes well with the others.
Mona, you're the best.
I love you.
Bye, sweetheart.
No, no, I don't kiss you.
Hey, Agatha Christie.
How you doing?
Great.
Someone is killing off all the gardeners in a small Connecticut town.
The police are stumped the town is paralyzed with fear, and all the lawns are going to seed.
Mona.
That's chilling, Mona, chilling.
Our only hope lies with our heroine a sexy, red-headed grandmother whose detective skills are only surpassed by her incredible body.
And I think the housekeeper did it.
What?
This?
Fresh gardener's blood.
You got me, Mona.
I caught him fooling around with my begonias.
This is not gardener's blood.
This is tomato sauce, and you smell like pepperoni.
You got it.
I gotta get that kitchen cleaned up before Angela comes home.
And what is this?
Yet another clue.
Pizza Playland.
Are you working there-?
Tony, are you moonlighting?
Hey, Dick Tracy, you got me, all right?
- I needed some extra money, that's all.
- Why?
Mother, open up!
Stall her.
I gotta get that kitchen cleaned.
- I'm coming, I'm coming.
- Mother!
Hold your horses!
Oh, well, it cost me a bundle but I got something wonderfuI for all my employees.
Scrooge.
Mother, what are you talking about?
Tony is holding down another job at night because you don't pay him enough to even buy Christmas presents for his little girI.
Humbug, Mother.
I just gave him a nice Christmas bonus.
He's working a night job?
Why?
I don't know, but he said he needed the money.
You don't think he's in trouble, do you?
I don't know, but I'm going to find out.
- Do you have a plan?
- I'm going to ask him.
Angela, you wouldn't last five minutes at Scotland Yard.
Look, I know I'm late, but I got the money.
I promise, I'll be there Saturday morning.
I'll be there.
Okay.
- Tony.
- Hi.
I'm just setting the table for breakfast.
You know me, always one step ahead of the game.
Tony, Mother told me what you're doing.
Angela, do I look like the kind of guy that kills gardeners?
Come on.
No, but you look like a guy who's working two jobs.
Oh, that.
I know I've been out of the house a lot, but only at night and I'm still doing a good job here, right?
Well, you did put the red towels in the wash with Jonathan's white shorts.
But nowadays, I mean, it's cooI for guys to wear pink, huh?
Angela, I don't know.
Tony, are you in some kind of trouble?
Do you owe someone money?
Angela, look, thanks for your concern, but this is kind of personaI.
You're gonna have to give me some space on this one.
Of course, Tony.
I hope you don't think that I was prying.
- Oh, no.
- It's just if you need anything LegaI advice, maybe.
- Angela, thank you, but, no, okay?
- Okay.
Gambling debts?
Are they after you?
- Who's "they"?
- You know, "them.
" People who talk like this.
You mean guys with laryngitis?
Oh, hi.
It's gorgeous out.
What a day.
- I'm in a wonderfuI mood.
- Me too.
- I just paid all my December bills.
- Good for you.
I'm running down to the corner mailbox, drop these off.
- You forgot one.
- That one's gotta be there today.
I'm gonna deliver that myself.
I see.
- Hello.
- Hi, Mother.
How are you?
Don't change the subject.
What about Tony?
Did you talk to him last night?
I did.
He said it was personaI, and I didn't pry.
What good are you?
Mother.
Whatever it is, he's going to take care of it today with that envelope.
No, no, no, Mother.
It's really none of our business.
No, right.
You're right.
Right.
You're absolutely right.
G.F. Lipari.
Who could G.F. Lipari be?
Godfather Lipari.
Angela, I've got great news!
Well, I'm glad you do, Mother.
I've got 62 employees and 61 presents.
So, what's the big deaI?
Fire someone.
That's the Christmas spirit, Mother.
Angela, I found out today that Tony is not in trouble.
He's not?
That's wonderfuI.
How do you know?
Well, elementary, my dear Angela.
I went for a little ride today and I just happened to find myself in Brooklyn in Tony's old neighbourhood, actually.
Mother, you followed him.
I know.
I almost lost him.
I couldn't find a parking space.
But Mona Robinson never loses her man.
I got there just in time to see Tony duck into a building and I followed him up to the third floor.
And there she was a beautiful dark-haired woman.
G.F. Lipari.
Mother, what are you saying?
Oh, Angela, take it out of neutraI.
He's keeping a woman!
He's keeping a woman.
Isn't it wonderfuI?
And all this time, we thought he was in trouble.
He's keeping a woman?
I am rearranging my life for him so he can fooI around with some Flatbush floozy?
Stop it!
Mona, glad you're here.
You gonna stick around for some scampi?
The best I ever made.
- That's terrific.
- Yeah.
I've rearranged my eggnog party to accommodate you.
I have sent my son to schooI in pink underwear, and why?
I give up.
So you could sneak down your back alleys to some torrid tryst with a Neapolitan nymphet.
Sounds so romantic.
It sounds great.
Where do I sign on?
What are you talking about?
Do you deny that you were in Brooklyn this afternoon?
- What if I was?
- With a check for a certain G.F. Lipari?
Hey, what, are you two tailing me?
When did you turn into Cagney and Lacey?
Your peccadillo is affecting my household.
I think I deserve an explanation.
Okay.
You want an explanation?
Mr. Lipari is my father's landlord.
I've been paying the rent on his apartment.
And what about the mysterious dark-haired woman?
That's the mysterious dark-haired daughter of Mr. Lipari.
Boy, Angela, you were way off on this one.
The guy raised the rent on me, so with Christmas coming I didn't know if I could make it, but I did, okay?
- Okay.
That's very commendable.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Dinner's served in five minutes.
- Hey, Angela.
You thought?
- Well, I Try to get your mind out of the gutter, all right?
This is all your fault.
Oh, Angela.
Why lay blame?
- Angela, I have a terrific idea.
- Forget it.
Why don't we invite Tony's father here for Christmas, huh?
It's Tony and Samantha's first Christmas in Connecticut.
Wouldn't it be nice if they had some family with them?
Well, it is a good idea, Mother, even if it is yours.
- I know it, I know it, I know it.
- All right, I'll go ask.
- Oh, good.
- Mom, look!
Oh, sweetheart, that's wonderfuI.
Told you she wouldn't know what it was.
Sam, come here.
Come sit down.
Honey, how would you like it if your Grandfather Micelli came to spend Christmas with us?
That would be great, Angela.
But I think you're a little late.
Oh, does he already have plans?
No.
He's been dead for over a year.
Well, you were way off on this one too, Angela.
Tony, I I kind of asked Samantha if your father wanted to come here and spend Christmas with us.
Yeah?
What'd she say?
Well, she didn't think he could make it.
No?
You know, he's He's dead.
That was her reason too.
Tony, this may be none of my business, but it seems a little unusuaI to keep paying rent for someone who well, isn't really in the position to appreciate it.
Hey, look, Angela.
The apartment is It's no big mystery.
I mean Finding a place in the city is rough.
I'm hanging on to this one in case things don't work out with us living together.
Not that we're " living together" living together.
How do you think things are working with you and me not " living together"?
Oh, terrific.
Great.
Why?
Don't you think so?
Oh, no complaints here.
Hey, you tried the rest.
Now you got the best.
Excuse me.
Why don't you let the apartment go?
I will, I will.
Soon as I get it cleaned out.
Well, Tony, I know that it's tough to clean out a place after someone, you know - Dies.
- Right, that.
I remember when Daddy - Died.
- Right.
Mother and I went and cleaned out his office.
I used to love that place.
He had a big mahogany desk and a view of the city.
Yeah?
That's funny.
My old man had a view of the city too.
Right from the back of the old garbage truck.
- He was a garbage man?
- Yeah.
Right on the block where I lived.
He loved that job.
I don't know, somehow he made it great.
Man.
Tony, what about the place?
I'll get it done.
I've just been busy.
Would you like to take the day off tomorrow?
- Tony?
- Angela?
Hold on.
- Hi.
- Hi.
How's it going?
Oh, I'm just packing up a storm.
- What are you doing?
- I left work early.
- I thought you might need some help.
- Yeah.
Come on in.
Thank you.
So this is where your father Lived.
Right.
Well You know, Tony, I always find that sometimes, at times like this, it helps if somebody comes and helps you.
Somebody who doesn't have an emotionaI attachment to these- Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh, my God.
Tony, I'm really sorry.
- It's all right.
Angela, it's okay.
- Tony!
Oh, no!
No!
Angela, this is from the fireplace!
My father's safe and sound in the Jamaica Avenue Cemetery.
Right.
I knew that.
Well It looks like slow going around here.
Yeah, well My father had a lot of stuff.
Hey, speaking of stuff.
See this ball?
This ball is signed by all the '62 Mets.
There, look.
" Marvellous" Marv Throneberry.
Choo Choo Coleman.
My old man was the biggest Mets fan that ever existed.
You know, he was the one who got me interested in baseball in the first place.
He must have been so proud when you made it in the major leagues.
Proud?
He was dancing in the streets.
You know, I remember when I came to town with the Cards, you know.
My father took out a whole section of the bleachers.
He brought everybody he knew, and guys he met in the parking lot.
You could hear him chanting all the way down to the dugout.
You know, "Tony, Tony, Tony.
" Yeah, I was so nervous I struck out the first three times I came to the plate.
Then I come up in the ninth, you know.
It's two on.
There's one out.
I hear him chanting, "Tony, Tony, Tony.
" You hit him a home run, didn't you?
I ground into a double play.
Dad was happy.
His kid was playing in the majors and the Mets finally won a game.
You must miss him.
Yeah, I miss him a lot.
There- There's a Christmas tree.
You weren't planning on spending Christmas here, were you?
That's from That's from last year.
My father died kind of sudden, right before Christmas, you know.
My present's still under the tree.
It's been a year.
Don't you think you want to open it?
Yeah, I guess.
He always said I was late for everything.
I guess this time he was right.
Come on.
You can do it.
It's his pocket watch.
I get the hint.
It's just beautifuI.
Oh, there's an inscription.
Look.
"To my 14-karat son.
" Angela, I don't think I can handle this.
Tony you've locked your father's memory away in this apartment for a year.
Why don't you give him a break.
Come on.
Take him back to Connecticut so he can be with his family.
Tony, I think this should just about do it.
- Here, let me get- - No, no, don't!
It's really heavy.
Well, it's not so much heavy as it is clumsy.
Tony, that's a great record collection.
Yeah, huh?
My old man was a sucker for these big bands, you know.
Yeah, look.
Tommy Dorsey.
There's Glenn Miller.
Les Brown and his Band of Renown.
You should have seen my old man do the Lindy.
What are you gonna do with all these records?
I don't know.
I mean, I guess I could give them to some retirement home or something like that, huh?
I mean, this is pretty cornball stuff.
Right.
But I love it.
- You do?
So do I. - You do?
Yeah.
So I could take them home and we'd play them all the time?
- Samantha and Jonathan'll hate us.
- That's the way it's supposed to be.
Well I guess this is it.
Yeah, Monday morning the Salvation Army comes - and cleans the rest of this stuff out.
- Right.
You know My old man lived here 15 years.
Now all it is is a room full of old furniture.
Tony, why don't I take this suitcase down and I'll wait for you in the van.
Angela.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
My new iron.
Well, that is the end of the presents, thank heavens.
Did everybody get what they wanted?
- Got my iron.
- Thanks, Dad.
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.
Hey, Mona, how about you?
Did Santa treat you good this year?
Too soon to tell.
He's meeting me at my place later.
I have an idea.
How about a little Christmas music?
Mom, what are you doing?
- I'm doing the Lindy, honey.
- You call that the Lindy?
- I'll show you how to Lindy.
- Dad, don't you dare!
Okay, come on, punkers.
It's Christmas.
Let's rock.
Come on, let's do the Lindy.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Take that, you dirty wax build-up.
Don't step on the floor!
Hey, you!
You missed a spot!
- Hey, Jonathan, wait up!
- Sam, don't- Don't worry, Sam, got it.
You could close the door!
Somebody else is coming!
That must be somebody else.
What's going on?
What, what, what?
Well, kids will be kids- - Sorry.
- Yeah, yeah.
Hey, Mona who was the big hairy kid with the wet nose?
That's Grover, my new roommate.
Oh, well, look, so people will talk, huh?
- As long as you're happy.
- You're right.
So tails will wag.
He did look like a big, lovable mutt, though.
There's an animaI out there attacking the children!
- Oh, I like him.
- Oh, Angela, look at them.
They're just playing.
Hey, give me a kiss.
- He's not vicious?
- Of course not.
He's just discriminating.
Hey, Grove.
Hey, Grove.
Oh, seems to like me.
Hey, she's all right once you get to know her.
That's Angela.
Hey, let's go down to Richard Welling's house.
I thought you were afraid of him.
Not anymore.
Just say the secret word: Angela.
- Isn't that cute?
- Hey, Grove, take it easy.
Where did you get him, Mother?
Does he have papers?
Oh, he doesn't need them.
He's housebroken.
Oh, Angela, I mean, what was I going to do?
Mr. Brubaker was going to be thrown out of his apartment if he didn't get rid of him.
Well, how come they're letting you stay?
Well, they're not.
- Eviction city.
- Eviction?
Mother, that means you're getting thrown out.
Didn't go to graduate schooI for nothing, did she?
Well, where are you going to stay?
Mom, what are all those suitcases doing out there?
Perhaps you'd like to stay here.
I never thought of that.
Mona's moving in.
All right!
- It's only temporary.
- It's just temporary.
Hey, what do you mean, temporary?
You're family.
Are you kidding?
You need a place to stay, you stay here as long as you want, temporarily.
Hold on, Grove, dinner's coming.
I don't believe it.
There's nothing.
There are no apartments, and the houses are out of sight.
- Don't worry, she'll find something.
- I don't know.
It's been three weeks.
- This is good.
- Yeah, yeah, good.
It'll also give you a shiny coat and prevent doggy breath.
Great, great news, lookie loos!
I am buying a condo, a brand-new condo.
- That's wonderfuI!
Where?
- It's in New London.
Oh, it's lovely.
It's all landscaped so beaut- Oh, Mother, well, New London is 60 miles away.
- There's nothing there but a NavaI base.
- That's another plus.
What's wrong with you staying here?
That's the way I grew up, the way I was raised.
One family under one roof.
Aunts, Uncle Vinnie, your cousins.
- You take care of your own.
- Well, that's very ethnic, Tony and it's very touching but it's just not Connecticut.
Anyway, Angela and I wouldn't last 20 minutes under the same roof, would we?
I got it.
I love it when I'm brilliant.
Are you kidding me?
You can live right out there in the garage.
What are you gonna do, put her up on blocks?
No, no, I mean the loft above the garage.
It used to be a barn, so it's big enough.
It'd be perfect.
Oh, great, it was good enough for a cow.
Use your imagination.
Some paint, some nails.
That loft'll make a terrific apartment and the best part, you'd be under different roofs.
Well, technically, we'd be under different roofs but, you know, Tony, it's still, you know close.
Well, New London is, you know, far.
So this is too close, and this is too far.
How many miles away should a mother live from her daughter?
Eight.
You know, Tony, you're right.
It does have a separate entrance so people could come and go.
What people?
The New York Jets, Angela.
I know two guys who could do the construction work, Battalia and Son.
Well, actually, I always have intended to do something with that space.
Bingo!
And I suppose with the money I was going to spend on a condo I could make a pad there.
Oh, no, you don't.
No, you don't.
It's my barn, I'll do it, and I'll rent it out to you.
No way.
Now, look, if it's going to be my apartment, I want it to be my way.
Ladies.
It'll be both of yours.
See, Mona'll pay for part.
You pay for decorations and for furnishings.
You pay for part, Angela.
You pay for structuraI and the basic stuff, okay?
You two are partners.
I love when things work out.
Oh, Mother, look at this.
Look how nicely they did this bathroom.
Where did they get those faucets?
They're so blah.
Mother!
They're the faucets I have!
Oh, well, I'm sure blah can be functionaI.
But look here, Angela.
Angela, look at these beauties.
- These are the ones I'm going to buy.
- Mother!
You can't put faucets like that in your house.
Suppose the children see them.
Fine, Mother, order the faucets.
What is this?
$3500 for a bathtub?
Well, I just got the basic modeI.
Eight jets, and it only seats two people.
Mother, I told you I didn't want to go ahead untiI we got an estimate.
I got an estimate.
A week from Wednesday.
You don't mind if the Battalias come in and have a beer, do you?
I am paying them by the hour.
Oh, yeah.
Hey, they'll drink fast.
Come on in, guys.
- Hello.
- Hey, hey, hey, father and son.
Hey, hey, hey, mother and daughter.
- Dynamite faucets.
- Thanks, Dom.
- Mother.
- The man has taste.
Would you mind giving me an estimate on how much the bathroom will cost?
Yeah, well, that depends on how many extras you want, you know?
I mean, for example, do you want electricity?
Well, yes.
You want water?
She wants electricity and- You want to write it down, son, please?
Electricity and water.
Do you want a door?
Well, it is a bathroom.
Do you want it to open?
Yeah, I think she wants it to open.
All right, we got electricity, water Okay, $2200.
- Yo, hey, paisan.
- Six hundred dollars.
Dom, look, I want you to make money, but let's not try to retire, huh?
What are you doing?
Are you gouging my friends?
Tony, will you?
I am just allowing myself a profit which is commensurate with the socioeconomic status of my client.
Yeah, what do you call that, Dom?
Gouging.
Angela, with all the money we're saving now we can go for the 8-foot picture window.
What 8-foot picture window?
The one in the sitting room that looks out through the elms.
- Right into my bedroom.
- Big deaI.
It's not as though anything happens there.
That wasn't necessary.
Why would you do that?
- What did you get us into, Dad?
- This is just a family squabble.
You know how families are.
Mother, you do not put a picture window in a rustic barn.
No picture window.
Who says, huh?
No picture window, no Mona, no apartment.
Hold it with the okay?
I mean, I don't care who lives in it.
AII I know is I'm building it.
I got a contract.
That's why they call me a contractor.
So that's where that came from.
Look, Mona, if you find yourself with a few extra minutes why don't you come on upstairs and watch me spackle.
What are you two doing?
What are we talking about here?
A bathtub, a picture window a couple of faucets that are rated PG-13.
- There's more important things in life.
- Yeah.
The most important thing in life is for her to run everybody's life!
- I'm just trying to tell you what's right.
- What's right?
You are a rigid, uptight, stick-in-the-mud!
And you are a frivolous self-centred child!
Face it, Angela, we have absolutely nothing in common!
You're right, absolutely nothing!
You've got a few things in common.
- You're both pig-headed.
- We're not-!
It's fine, Mother.
Whatever you decide to do with the apartment is fine because I am never, ever setting foot in it.
Ever!
- Come on, now - That's the best news I've heard all day.
- Is that a promise?
- It is!
Good, then I'm moving up there right now.
Mona.
Mona, there's no heat.
There's no electricity.
There's noth- You know, I thought Brooklyn was loud.
- Oh, hi, Dad.
- Hi, sweetheart.
- I thought I heard you in the shower.
- No, it's Mona.
She still doesn't have heat or water so as soon as Angela left, I snuck her in the bathroom.
Good idea.
A week out in that barn, and she must be kind of ripe.
Don't worry about it.
We're taking care of her.
Hi, everybody.
Hi, Angela.
I thought you went shopping.
Well, I got to the expressway and I realized I forgot my credit cards.
- What's the matter?
- She just means it's terrible thing - to leave home without them.
- I'm lost without mine.
See?
See?
- Good luck, Dad.
- Thanks, have a good game.
Hey, sit.
I'll get them.
I'll get them.
- I'm here to serve.
- Tony - what is going on around here?
- Nothing, nothing.
I want you to save your energy to fight them bargain hunters at Gucci's.
- Mother.
- Angela.
Oh, you still remember each other's names.
I must have made a wrong turn.
Which way is it to the health club?
The health club.
Is she a riot?
Is she-?
She's- After everything, she hasn't lost her sense of humour.
- I have.
- Who will notice?
Oh, here's 50 cents for the shower I took and I made a phone call.
Here's my dime.
- Mother.
- Yes?
A phone call is 20 cents now.
Put it on my bill.
How long is this gonna go on?
Go up there and talk to her.
I said I was not going up there, and I'm not.
You didn't mean everything you said.
She meant what she said, and that hurts.
And what really hurts is that she's right.
Sometimes I- I wish I were less like me and more like her.
- Aw, come on- - No, really, she's this free spirit and I'm so controlled and conservative, and I don't know, whatever else she said.
- Rigid and uptight.
- Thanks a lot, Tony.
Stick-in-the-mud was But she doesn't mean it that way.
Your mother has a hard time expressing her feelings about you but she feels.
She feels, let me tell you.
- Excuse me- - Excuse me, this is my house.
You do not come busting in here like this.
Right, sorry.
- Come in.
- Excuse me, Mrs. Bower would it be all right if I borrowed your fire extinguisher?
- Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, a fire.
- I got it, I got it.
No problemo!
No problemo!
Everything is going to be fine.
Don't worry about a thing.
Get over there quick!
What happened?
Well, the wires are smouldering a little bit.
But it's gonna be fine when we get the room rewired.
- Rewired?
How much will that cost?
- Oh, $1500.
Six hundred dollars.
Come in!
- It's open.
- Yeah.
I guess the Battalias were right, huh?
You should have sprung for the hinges.
Hey, Mone, look at this place, huh?
Walls and everything.
It's great.
Yeah, I'm going to be in the next issue of Better Homes and Barns.
Hey, Mone, I'm sorry about Angela catching you coming out of the shower.
Beats running naked through the car wash.
I never know what to tip those guys who toweI you off.
My man, Grove.
Hey, hey, Grover, baby.
Grove.
I love this dog.
Grover, what's happening, huh?
It's okay.
Don't get up.
- Pull up a naiI keg and sit down.
- All right, hey, look.
- Mone, I talked to Angela.
- Oh, about what?
About coming up here and talking to you.
What did she say?
She said, no way.
It's up to you.
Had lunch?
- What, are you kidding, Mona?
- Here.
Make yourself usefuI.
I mean, there's nothing to talk about, Tony.
I cannot tell her she's wrong.
I am irresponsible.
She knows me.
Mona, she didn't mean " irresponsible.
" She meant "fun-loving" and "delightfuI".
Oh, sure.
Mona, look, all you gotta do is apologize to her.
Have a pickle.
Thanks.
Boy, you really know how to live.
Listen, Mone, I hope you like these rare.
Don't bite the screwdriver.
- Ready?
- I don't know.
- Here we go.
- Okay.
Oh, Mone, I think- - Maybe- Maybe Grover'll like these.
- Oh, boy.
Grove, here you go.
You like this hot dog?
Hey.
Oh, come on, Grove.
That dog will do anything for a laugh.
Yeah, you and that dog make a great team.
It's just you and your daughter that I'm having a hard time understanding.
Well Tony, look, if Angela is a little square, and she is, it's really my fault.
How do you figure?
Well, you see, Angela was only 14 when her father died and he- He took care of everything.
I mean, me, the house, the business.
And I was a little over-protected.
I just didn't know how to deaI with anything.
- Well, somehow you managed, Mona.
- No, Tony, I didn't.
Angela did.
She paid the bills, she balanced the checkbook she took care of the house, and I let her.
Well, now she is the president of a big advertising agency.
And you did that too, Mona.
- Thanks, Tony.
- You bet your life.
Now, come on.
You guys gotta make up.
- It's all right.
You guys can make up.
- Yeah, sure.
Yeah, we can.
Okay.
Sure.
Just as soon as she gets her uptight buns up here and begs my forgiveness.
Tony?
Tony?
Where is everybody?
What is that racket?
I'm hungry.
Oh, hey.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Wait.
Where are you going with those sandwiches?
You're late.
We're going to Mona's.
- For what?
- For Mona's housewarming party.
I don't know anything about it.
I wasn't invited.
Oh, your invitation probably got lost in the maiI.
- It had so far to go.
- Come on, Angela.
Angela there's good food up there.
Food.
Yeah.
I'm not hungry.
There's cute guys up there too.
I'm not interested.
Sounds like the party's heating up.
I gotta go.
Hey.
Tony, would you please tell the tenant to turn the music down?
Oh, hey, hey, ho, I'm just a guest.
I don't wanna get involved in tenant-landlord relationships.
You expect me to go up there?
You're the landlady.
Turn that music down!
Mother, turn the music off.
I can't hear you, Angela.
I've got pillows on my ears.
I am trying to tell you to turn the music off!
Oh, Angela, you need not shout.
The music was bad enough.
I'm sorry.
Where do you think it was coming from?
Well, I thought it was you trying to blast me out.
Well, I thought it was you having a housewarming party.
And where would you ever get a crazy idea like that?
Room service.
- I should've known: the "music man.
" - There you go, ladies.
Whatever you're trying to do, it's not going to work.
Tony, your heart may be in the right place, but your nose isn't.
So butt out.
No tip?
All right, go ahead.
Stay mad at each other.
See if I care.
I don't care.
I just have to say one thing, though.
Take a look at this place.
Would you look around?
You see what happens when you put an intelligent, no-nonsense executive together with a creative, imaginative free spirit?
This place is beautifuI.
Who says a stuffed shirt and a flake can't work together?
Huh?
You think about it.
I'm out of here.
He always gets so worked up about things.
Well, maybe we all do.
I know you do.
Mother the place looks very nice.
Really, it- It looks great.
Mother.
Oh, Mother, this is terrific.
Mother, you've done a wonderfuI job.
I'll drink to that.
Oh, Mother, I love you dearly but sometimes you just make me crazy.
I'll drink to that too.
- Mother, you just don't think.
- I know, dear.
But that's why I've got you because you're always dependable, responsible practicaI, predictable, plodding pokey.
Pedestrian, pedantic.
Well, I guess that covers the Ps.
That's why I need you, Mother.
You put some other letters in my life.
Okay, Angela.
Here's to U and I. Mother, it's "you" and "me.
" Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute.
Tony took my Dom Perignon.
I was saving this for a romantic evening.
Oh, Angela, eventually this stuff goes flat.
Hi.
I didn't see anybody come storming out, no bodies were flying around I figured it was safe to come back.
You know what time it is?
It's party time!
I promised you a party.
There's music, there's dancing, there's food.
- Where are the cute guys?
- You're looking at us.
Here, Grove.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Here we are.
Frosty, Rudolph, Slushpuppy!
Yeah!
Oh, you are soaking wet!
What happened?
Richard Welling flipped my sleigh over.
- Oh, sweetheart.
- It's okay, Mom.
We nailed him with a zillion snowballs, didn't we, Tony?
- We?
- Well, you know the kid wore himself out making them, so somebody had to throw them.
You threw snowballs at a sixth grader?
Yeah, that's a big kid, Angela.
He's going through elementary schooI on the GI Bill.
- Besides, he started it.
- Upstairs.
Get out of those clothes.
That sounds great, but I've got to get dinner- No, I'm kidding.
You, upstairs.
Take a nice hot bubble bath.
Hey, wait for me, Grover!
Don't let that dog eat the soap again.
He was barking bubbles for weeks, that dog.
I got it, I got it.
Don't look now, man, but your muffler's moving.
- Who are you?
- Who am I?
Who are you?
Don't tell me, another door-to-door snake salesman?
- MichaeI.
- Hi, Angela.
- You know the guy?
- Here we are, the boas from BraziI.
I guess maybe I should have called first?
You're not big on drop-in guests.
- Angela?
- What?
Now, don't be like that.
Look, it's just a harmless little boa constrictor.
I'll put him away.
You're missing the point, MichaeI.
The snake is welcome here.
Isn't she a cutie, huh?
Crawled into my sleeping bag one night in the Amazon.
- That's very funny, MichaeI.
- Yeah, she's my main squeeze.
Hey, Angela, who is this clown?
Tony, this is MichaeI Bower.
Wait a minute.
Bower?
Bower is your name.
That's where I got it.
This clown is my husband.
- Husband?
- Yeah, you know, husband.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I got the picture.
Wait a minute.
- Angela, you said you were divorced.
- I don't think I ever said that, Tony - because I'm not.
Not yet.
- Yeah, okay, okay.
Wait a minute.
When I moved in, you told me your husband left you.
You never brought him up again.
I didn't think it was anything you needed to know.
I'm beginning to understand what's going on here.
- You are the reason for this.
- What?
I come out of the jungle after six months.
I haven't even taken a shower, and some lawyer knocks on my door to serve me with divorce papers.
Now I understand why.
Mike, you've got this all wrong.
I'm Angela's- Your wife's housekeeper.
- Come on, you can do better than that.
- No, I mean it.
Look, I've got dishpan hands.
Look, I got Tony, you don't owe MichaeI any explanation.
- What we do is none of his business.
- Angela, we don't do anything.
- Well, we could if we wanted to.
- Yeah- yeah?
Okay.
Okay, so if he's not your boyfriend, then why this?
That's the way it works.
First, you get separated then get divorced.
Don't take it personally.
- Couldn't we have talked about it first?
- Same old story.
- Who knew where you were?
- I called you when I was making - that documentary from Kenya.
- That was nine months ago.
Boy, has it been that long?
Gee, time really flies when you're waiting for a couple of hippos to mate.
First of all, they gotta fall in love.
Then you've got to find a Chevy - with a back seat that's big enough.
- You missed your son's birthday.
- What do you think the snake is for?
- Yeah, yeah.
Jonathan likes snakes.
You couldn't just find a Cabbage Patch doll?
- Hi, I'm home.
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.
- Thanks for the leg warmers, Angela.
- You're welcome.
You can keep them.
- Thanks.
- Give me a kiss.
I know I've been away a long time, but isn't Jonathan a 7-year-old boy?
This is Samantha, Tony's daughter.
- Hi.
- Hi.
You live here?
- Yeah, yeah.
We both do.
- Well, here we are one big happy family, huh?
Yeah, yeah, Tarzan meets The Brady Bunch.
Samantha, this is MichaeI Bower, my husband.
- Husband?
- Yeah.
No, no, no - Very nice to meet you, Mr. Bower.
- That's a good girI.
You punk, you!
I'll get you yet, Richard Welling!
Mona, be carefuI.
That kid could be dangerous if he had better aim.
You see?
He missed you completely.
- I'll kill him.
I'll kill him.
- No, no, Tony.
Never mind.
Forget it.
Actually, I started it this time.
Well, if it isn't Indiana Jones.
Come on, Mom.
Look, what do you say, let's bury the hatchet.
Don't tempt me.
Look, I even brought you a present.
What?
I see you're still travelling with the same crowd.
Well, I guess it's unanimous.
I don't think there is one person here who's happy to see you.
Hey, Tony, where's-?
- Daddy!
- Hey, little tiger!
- Isn't he great?
- Yeah.
- Can we call him Fred?
- Well, we could but he probably wouldn't like it.
You see, he's a she.
- How can you tell it's a she?
- By her long eyelashes her curvaceous figure and her forked tongue.
Jonathan, if you are through playing with your cold-blooded friends I think it's time for bed.
Come on, I'll tuck you in.
I want Daddy to.
It's still the room at the top of the stairs.
Okay, tiger, what do you say?
How about a piggyback?
- Think you can carry me?
- Daddy.
Okay, here we go.
- Good night, Mom.
- Good night, Mom.
- Hey, how's the snake?
- He's putting Jonathan to bed.
That's right, dear, vent those hostilities.
Oh, I'm not hostile, Mother.
Just because I take care of my son day after day and then MichaeI waltzes in here once a year with some exotic gift for Jonathan and Jonathan worships the ground he walks on!
Well, as long as you're not hostile.
Hey, Angela, Angela, let me cut it for you.
Mona's grown accustomed to her ears.
Boy, Jonathan went out like a light.
- Hey, is Sam sleeping?
- No, no.
She's watching some movie about bloodsucking puppets.
- She's in big trouble.
- I wouldn't let my kid watch that either.
What, are you kidding me?
I told her to call me when it started.
Well, I guess I'd better hit the books.
I have a finaI tomorrow.
Mona, you finally did it, huh?
You went back to college.
Gee, that's terrific.
Knowledge is its own reward, isn't it?
No, the reward is the spring break in Fort Lauderdale.
Same old Mona.
Same old MichaeI.
Make that jerk sign those divorce papers.
So signed any good divorce papers lately?
No, I'm trying to cut down.
I don't have a pen.
Good night, mother.
Angela, are you sure you want a divorce?
The lawyer went to all this trouble MichaeI, we have seen each other twice in a year.
That does not make a happy marriage.
Look on the bright side.
We've only had two fights.
Angela, divorce, it sounds so finaI.
Well, MichaeI, this was your decision.
You're the one who left.
Now, that's not quite fair.
I asked you to come with me.
Jonathan was 6 years old and you wanted us to move to the jungle and teach gorillas to talk.
Okay, so it didn't work.
They're pretty good little dancers, though.
Angela, come on, Jonathan would have loved it.
And besides, I won an award for that documentary.
You won an award.
Your career.
What about my career?
It was finally starting to work.
Writing jingles for yodelling donuts?
I will have you know that that campaign had this entire country dunking!
And yodelling!
I am very good at what I do.
That is why they made me the president.
- President?
Of- Of- - Of Wallace and McQuaid.
That's right.
I am queen of the jingle, jungle man.
Wait a minute.
I knew you were good, but president Wow.
I didn't know you had it in you.
That's because you never looked.
Well, I'm looking now.
I'm impressed.
I- I'm proud of you, Angela.
Thank you, MichaeI.
So now that you're a big shot, you want to dump me, huh?
No, MichaeI.
It's just It's just not the kind of relationship that I had planned.
Call me sentimentaI.
I thought my husband and I would live in the same hemisphere.
All my assignments aren't that far away.
Remember when you came to Texas with me?
Remember that incredible west Texas sunset?
That case of Mexican tequila?
And the two-man sleeping bag.
You know, I'd rather share my bedroll with you than any snake I ever met.
Well, you sure know how to sweet-talk a girI, MichaeI.
Angela, I really do miss you.
MichaeI, you can't live like this, and I can't live like that.
So it's over.
Right.
Oh, Angela!
Good boy, Grove.
You finished with the sports page?
Okay, stay.
Let's go Jonathan, 6:45, rise and shine!
- Morning, Dad.
- You beat me, huh?
Breakfast in 20 minutes.
Good girI.
Come on, Jonathan, let's hit it, let's move it, let's do it!
The kid's nothing untiI he has his first cup of Ovaltine.
Angela?
Rise and shine!
Time to sell all those things to America they can't afford!
What the hell's going on here?
Hi.
Dad, you're supposed to beat the eggs, not mug them.
What?
Hold your horses untiI they're done.
They're done.
All right, okay.
Excuse me.
- Good morning.
- I'll bet.
- What was that?
- Nothing.
Nothing, Angela.
- Would you like some eggs?
- No, Tony.
I always have just juice and coffee.
Yeah, I know, but I figured this morning you might have an appetite.
What is that supposed to mean?
Look, I'm just a housekeeper here- I'm just a housekeeper here.
Hear no eviI, see no eviI, speak no eviI.
Mom, what's all the whispering about?
Nothing, dear.
Just keep chewing.
What do you mean, eviI?
Look, I may be way out of line here, but I don't want to see you get hurt.
- I think you're moving a little too fast.
- Tony, we're married.
Yeah, but you're engaged to be divorced.
Well, last night, I don't know what happened.
One minute I was asking him to sign the divorce papers and the next minute, it seemed inappropriate.
Inappropriate, huh?
- I hope you know what you're doing.
- So do I. Wow, something smells good.
Daddy, what are you doing here?
He wanted to show up bright and early to have breakfast with you, buddy!
Aren't those the same clothes you wore yesterday?
I'd like to kill you.
I like these clothes.
These are my favourite clothes.
- Morning, Angela.
- Good morning, MichaeI.
Sleep okay?
Fine.
Yes.
Well, you know, nothing unusuaI.
- How did you sleep?
- Fine, just fine.
We all slept fine.
- Can I get you something for breakfast?
- Don't bother, I'll do it myself.
Where are the bowls?
I moved them over here, closer to the dishwasher.
Yeah, but over here they're closer to the Crunchy Crawlers.
What happened to the Crunchy Crawlers?
Daddy, Crunchy Crawlers are just empty calories.
- That's what Tony says.
- I just And he's right.
I could beat up some more eggs for you.
No, I'll just have some juice.
- Is that still kept in the refrigerator?
- Yeah, but it's on a different shelf.
Hey, am I going to see you tonight, Daddy?
Well, I was thinking about taking us all out to dinner tonight.
Hey, that's great!
Isn't that, Sam?
Yeah, that means Dad won't have to cook.
Well, actually, I- I meant just the family.
Well, Tony and Samantha are our family.
- Yes, you're welcome to come with us.
- No, no, that's okay.
Thanks very much, but me and Samantha we have plans.
Right, Samantha?
Oh, right, plans.
We've had them for months.
Months, months.
Where are you going?
Bago Burger, Videoville, the hockey game and then we'll stop by Pie City for something to eat.
Right, Dad?
Right, Samantha.
Tony, are you ready?
Lately I'm ready for anything.
Oh, yeah?
Holy moly!
I wasn't ready.
Well, it's Mona the Magnificent, huh?
Watch out, Fort Lauderdale.
No wonder that's where the boys are.
Thank you, thank you.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Mother, you're wearing a bathing suit.
What?
How did it get on me?
I just meant isn't it a little revealing?
I certainly hope so.
No mother, I meant, you know, your delicate skin.
You know how you burn.
Well, I'll only wear it at night, dear.
Good.
Tony, would you set another place for dinner?
MichaeI will be over.
Oh, gee, what a surprise.
Well, don't worry about him.
He's been here two days in a row.
For him, that's a record.
Pretty soon he'll be hearing the call of the wild.
I think I heard that last night.
Really?
Annette Funicello?
Take a Skippy break, huh?
So where is everybody?
Some of us are here.
Who did you have in mind?
Well, is Angela home?
She'll be out in one minute, give or take 15 seconds.
- What are you doing?
- It's Friday.
Angela always has a very dry martini, straight up.
Oh, yes.
Two olives.
Well, I don't think she's going to want a martini tonight.
Well, I wouldn't pop my cork just yet, MichaeI.
- Hi, honey.
- That must be you.
Hi, sweetheart.
- How was your day?
- Just beginning.
- How about a touch of the bubbly?
- Oh, MichaeI, that looks divine.
- No, I think I'd rather have that.
- Straight up, two olives.
Well, darling, we can save this for a speciaI occasion.
Well, I just happen to have one.
The Geographic Institute has given me a very speciaI new assignment.
A new assignment?
Oh, I'm so sorry you have to leave.
I suppose you'll be catching the 8: 10 yak to Tibet?
- MichaeI, where are you going?
- To a bizarre little island where hostile creatures scurry through underground tunnels.
It's called Manhattan.
MichaeI, you're going to be working in New York?
Yeah, I've finally accepted that desk job.
You are looking at the new head of the documentary department.
Oh, darling, that's terrific.
Yeah, yeah, that's terrific.
Does that mean you're going to be moving in?
Angela?
Well, of course that's what it means.
Boy, oh, boy, that's great.
That's really great.
Open the champagne, MichaeI.
I guess I won't be needing this.
I will.
Let me have a sip.
- Hi.
How are you doing?
- Tony, you're quite a housekeeper.
Yeah, yeah.
Well, I grew up watching a lot of Hazel.
I bet there are a lot of houses around here that could use you.
Well, you know, there's not enough of me to go around.
Well, maybe we ought to give someone else a turn.
Wait a minute.
What are you-?
What are you saying?
Tony, look, you're not just a housekeeper.
You're Jonathan's father, Angela's friend and that's supposed to be my job now.
You know, it's funny.
It sounds like you're giving me two weeks notice.
If you need that long.
Look, I'm sorry, Tony.
We'll give you a good recommendation, okay?
I've got to go to the hoteI, pick up the rest of my gear.
- Yeah, but- - See you.
This never happened to HazeI.
I'm in the mood for love Simply because- Tony, I thought maybe we could start our spring cleaning early.
Sure, squeeze the last drop of blood out of the old workhorse.
I thought if we cleaned the garage, we could store MichaeI's stuff there.
As soon as my stuff's out, there will be plenty of room.
- What are you talking about?
- Didn't MichaeI tell you?
- He let me go.
- Let you go where?
Anywhere I want, Angela.
Get it up to speed.
I'm out, I'm fired, I'm canned.
- Who does he think he is?
- Your husband, remember?
Well, that doesn't give him the right to- - Don't worry.
I'll take care of this.
- No, Angela, wait.
You know, he's right.
I don't belong here.
Tony, this is your home.
No, no, it's his home, and you're his family.
No.
You're not going.
Angela, you decided to give your marriage a second chance, right?
- Right.
- Then give it a chance.
If MichaeI says I'm in the way, I'm in the way.
- Well, I don't think so.
- Angela, not many people get a second chance at marriage.
It's happening for you You don't need some hairy Italian in an apron - hanging around screwing it up.
- Tony, you can't leave.
Why not?
Well Who's going to save us from Richard Welling and his ballistic snowballs?
Look, Angela, if you don't fire me, I've got to quit.
I've got to.
I don't know what to say.
How about, " I'll give you two weeks' severance pay"?
You got it.
How about three?
- That's the joke, you know.
- Yeah.
- I'll miss you.
- Hey, we're going to keep in touch.
Right.
Right, we're going to keep in touch.
Well
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
If you don't mind, sir, I will announce you to Mrs. Randolf.
Yeah, sure.
Go ahead.
Go do your thing.
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- Yes, Leo?
Another applicant for the housekeeper's position.
And how does she look?
A little butch, ma'am.
Hey, how are you doing?
You must be Mrs. Randolf.
Hey, nice set of wheels.
Let me move you over here near the sun.
It'll be better over near the sun.
What do you think?
Is that better?
- Leo, who is this man?
- I'm Tony.
Tony Micelli.
I tried to tell him, Mrs. R. We want a maid, not a chauffeur.
- We already have a chauffeur.
- I know, Leo.
Why don't you go wax something?
I thought you'd never ask.
That's a fun guy.
Listen, Mrs. Randolf, I know you probably thought you were gonna get a housekeeper a little bit more dainty than me.
But I swear I'll do a good job, and I've got experience.
I've been working for Angela Bower.
You know her?
- Would that be the Bar Harbor Bowers?
- No.
That's the Oakhills Drive Bowers.
- Oh, the south side of town.
- Yeah, well, Angela's terrific.
- I mean, Mrs. Bower.
- Oh, I see.
Well, I want you to know that I have a strict policy with my help.
I do not fooI around.
Mrs. R, what, are you kidding me or what?
It was nothing like that.
See, I always thought Angela was divorced, untiI about a week ago.
Hey, Angela, who is this clown?
This clown is my husband.
- Husband?
- Yeah, you know, husband.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I got the picture.
Wait a minute.
- Angela, you said you were divorced.
- I don't think I ever said that, Tony because I'm not.
Not yet.
MichaeI, you can't live like this, and I can't live like that.
So it's over?
Right.
Angela?
Rise and shine!
Time to sell all those things to America they can't afford!
What the hell's going on here?
Hi.
You know, it's funny.
It sounds like you're giving me two weeks notice.
If you need that long.
I'll miss you.
So that's about it.
I mean, I didn't want to go and Angela didn't want me to leave but I think it was the right thing to do.
What do you think, Mrs. R?
I think you'd better get me out of the sun.
I don't want to wrinkle.
Angela, how about some tea?
Oh, I don't feeI like any.
Oh, MichaeI, you made tea.
I'd love some.
I didn't know you were working.
We can do it later.
- It's okay.
I can take a break.
- That's okay.
- Your work is more important.
- No, you are.
I want us to be together.
- We'll be together later.
- MichaeI!
I'd like the tea now, honey.
Whatever you say, sweetheart.
There was a time when it would have bothered you that I was working on a Saturday.
Well, you're looking at the new, improved MichaeI.
I respect you, and I respect your work.
Besides, you don't do this every Saturday.
Do you?
Not anymore.
What do I have to do to get a bellhop, huh?
Mother.
Welcome home.
Sweetheart.
- How was Fort Lauderdale?
- Cold, windy, rainy.
- Everybody left but me and Freddie.
- Who's Freddie?
Hurricane Freddie.
Don't you read the papers?
You know the Fountainbleu?
It did.
The HoteI Fountainbleu is not in Fort Lauderdale.
It is now.
So where's my Grover?
Here's my boy.
Come here, sweetie.
Did you miss me?
Huh?
Did you get my postcard?
Hey, sweetie.
Look, I brought you a bone.
Pick it up.
There's a good boy.
Go bury it.
Okay, so don't worry.
I brought you something too.
Hey, how's that, huh?
Oh, Mother.
Oh, Mother, a coconut head.
Bloomingdale's has been out of these for months.
And shark's teeth here for Jonathan.
And puka shells for Samantha.
And I did have something for you, MichaeI but they wouldn't let me bring a stingray on the plane.
And here we go for Tony, we got a beach toweI.
As always, Mother, in perfect taste.
He'll love it.
Where is he?
- Well, Mother- - The thing is- Yeah, Mother, he's kind of looking for a job.
He quit?
No, no, no, we kind of let him go.
Are you out of your bird?
Oh, Mother, everything's going to be fine.
We'll have someone in to clean once a week, and I'll do the cooking.
Angela the only thing you know about a kitchen is that someone's in there with Dinah.
I'm going to help with the cooking.
We're going to share everything.
How liberated.
Well, I'll eat out.
Oh, it's going to be so nice with little cozy family dinners.
We'll have lots of time to be alone together.
It's going to be great.
It's great just thinking about how great it's going to be.
First, airplane food, and now this.
Listen, have you two thought what this is going to do to Tony?
Come on, Mother, don't worry about it.
He's going to be fine.
- He'll get another job.
- Doing what, pray tell?
Angela, it means he's going to have to move back to Brooklyn tear Samantha out of schooI pull her away from her little playmates and take her to a dark cramped apartment with disgusting graffiti all over the wall where her only playground is the means streets of a heartless city.
Angela- I got a job!
Tony, you can't leave Connecticut!
You can't do this to Samantha.
She deserves better.
She deserves a good home and a nice schooI and green grass to play on and little friends.
She'll have that and more.
She'll have indoorloutdoor tennis courts, two pools, riding stables and the whole west wing of a building that makes this one look a little dowdy.
You are looking at Mrs. Wilfred Randolf III's personaI companion and household manager.
Well, like I said, Angela, he can do better than this dump.
Tony, how are you going to clean all those rooms?
Mona, I'm the supervisor.
I got people to do that.
There's Bridget, the upstairs maid there's Monique, the downstairs maid and then there's Cecily in the kitchen.
You know, if I had a pipe, I'd be Hugh Hefner.
Yeah, you know, it sounds good now but Tony, you're going to get tired of that in 30 or 40 years.
Yeah, sure.
If you move, how are you going to teach me to throw a spitball?
Jonathan, we're in the same neighbourhood.
You're just in the poor section.
Come on, there's another load upstairs.
- I'll get it.
- No, no, no.
Please, allow me.
Just for old times' sake.
Hey, Leo.
What's shaking, man?
Shaking, sir?
If you mean what's going down, Mrs. Randolf sent me to collect your belongings.
Well, they're all here.
Leo, didn't I meet you at the toga party at the Delta House?
If you say so, ma'am.
Come on, Leo, here they go.
Good, sir.
I hate to leave the Bentley unattended in this neighbourhood.
My mother will walk you to the car so you don't get mugged.
Oh, goodie, the buddy system.
- Tony.
- What?
Could I see you in the kitchen for a minute?
- Yeah, sure.
Here, Leo.
- Very good, sir.
I'll put your matching luggage in the limo.
Yeah, what's the problem?
- Nothing.
Nothing.
I just had a quick question about the new toaster oven.
Yeah, it's nice, isn't it?
Go ahead, shoot.
Well, when do you toast and when do you top brown?
Well, that depends.
What are you making, Angela?
Well, let's say it was something like a Pop Tart.
- A what?
- A Pop Tart, okay?
I'm making a Pop Tart.
Angela, I'm not even out of the house yet.
Before you know it, this guy'll have you hooked on Crunchy Crawlers.
You toast it, Angela.
You toast it.
Okay.
Well, what do you do about the frosting?
Well, if you really want to be a gourmet you toast it for a while, then add a dab of butter then top brown it for the last 10 seconds.
Well, maybe I should write that down.
Are you sure you'll be all right here without me?
- Tony.
- Let me show you - how this whole place works.
- I know how my own kitchen works.
- I was just confused by the frosting.
- All right, all right, all right.
You know how to work this self-cleaning oven, right?
Come on, Tony, you're not trying to tell me that this oven really cleans itself?
- What are you reading?
- An absolutely worthless campaign that I can't show to the client.
I thought we agreed no working after dinner.
I would have been through working before dinner if I wasn't so busy making dinner on your night to make dinner.
I'm sorry.
I missed my stop.
MichaeI, you found the lost tribe of Tanzania.
Why can't you find a way home to Connecticut?
You know what I did all day?
I edited a film called Lions, Nature's Pride.
You know what lions do most of the time?
Chase zebras and audition for MGM?
No, Angela, they sleep.
And I watched them, frame by frame, for 81 I2 hours.
It is very boring.
It was dark, and I fell asleep on the train on the way home.
I missed my stop.
I'm sorry.
I'll make dinner tomorrow night, okay?
Okay, okay.
I'm sorry too.
We've both had a long day.
Yeah.
But now is our time.
Now, how about putting the work away, huh?
You're right.
Well, what do you want to do?
MichaeI, don't you want to talk or something?
Yeah, sure, let's talk, okay.
What do you want to talk about?
Well, how was your day?
- The lions - Oh, right, sleeping.
- Well, hey, this is pretty terrific, huh?
- Oh, this is terrific.
Well, I'm all talked out.
Do you want to fooI around?
It's probably your office.
Again.
I'll go turn on the answering machine.
- Hi.
This is Angela - And Michael Bower.
- Together again.
- Together again.
- Leave a message at the tone.
- Yeah, we'll call you back.
Hi, Angela.
This is Jim Peterson from the office.
I was wondering what you thought of the Scrubbo campaign.
I think it stinks.
Well, I can see you're not home.
I guess you lik ed it, or I would have heard from you, right?
Wrong.
I hate it.
I think it's garbage.
Yeah, I'm kind of fond of it myself.
WonderfuI.
He thinks it's fine.
Come on, you're getting worked up over nothing.
Nothing?
Nothing?
You can't appeaI to today's consumer with a slogan like: " Kitchen woes?
Use Scrubbos.
" - It's just a scouring pad.
It may be just a scouring pad to you but it happens to be a very important account to me.
Why don't you answer that?
It's probably for you.
I'm going to take a walk.
- Hi.
This is Angela - And Michael Bower.
- Together again.
- Together again.
- Leave a message at the tone.
- Yeah, we'll call you back.
Hey, guys, it's me, Tony.
Together again, huh?
Well, I guess you're not home.
Or else you're there and you're too busy to come to the phone.
Well, guys, duty calls.
I just wanted to call and see how you lovebirds were doing.
Bye.
Hey, Mrs. Randolf, you were great today.
Oh, it's been fun.
I haven't been bowling for years.
Yeah, I bet a lot's changed since then, huh?
Well, one thing is the same.
You can push that little light as much as you want and you still can't get a waitress to bring you a beer.
Well, how about some tea?
Oh, it's not the same.
But I guess it is tea time.
- It's tea time, ma'am.
- What did I tell you?
Shall I remove that bowling ball or will you be needing it later again this evening?
That's a good idea.
Here you go.
- Gotcha.
- So you did, sir.
I like Leo.
He's a good guy.
By the way, Mrs. R I'm really sorry about getting us back so late.
Oh, don't be.
I enjoyed the ride.
Especially when we drove by Angela's house four times.
Four times.
Really.
Just seemed like three to me.
Tony, I just want you to know you've done a really great job.
Since you've been here, I feeI 75 again.
Let me tell you, you're looking great, baby.
The house is spotless, and the staff has never been happier especially Cecily.
Well, you know, I'm a people person, you know.
But we could get along without you, young man.
Oh, no, not again.
Don't tell me.
Your husband's coming home from the jungle?
No.
It's just that I think there are some people in that little cottage we drove by that mean a lot to you.
- Why don't you just go pay a visit.
- No, I can't go back there, Mrs. R. Just a visit.
Take them some canned goods.
Mother I don't understand it.
I don't know how Tony gets the mashed potatoes so fluffy.
I think he cooks them first.
- I'll get it.
- Oh, thanks.
- Tennis, anyone?
- Tennis, anyone?
- Hi.
- Hi, Mona.
Oh, Jonathan, someone's here to see you.
Who is it?
- Hi, Jonathan.
- Samantha!
- So how you doing?
- Okay.
- Did you miss me?
- Not really.
Me neither.
You wanna go look at some of my new baseball cards?
Okay!
He's been talking about her all week long.
Yeah?
Has he mentioned me?
- Angela.
- Tony!
- Hi.
- How you doing?
- Me?
I'm great.
I'm really great.
- Me too.
Me too.
So things are working out great for you and MichaeI, huh?
Oh, working out?
It's bliss.
Yeah, we got bliss coming out our ears.
I was- I was looking for- I was kind of looking for a little tennis match.
Tony, I'd love to, but I've got a casserole in the oven.
- You?
- Yeah.
And I'm making mashed potatoes.
I'm boiling them first.
A regular Betty Crocker.
- So how's work?
- Don't ask.
We've run into a brick wall on that Scrubbo campaign.
No kidding.
Why?
Scrubbo's a good product.
It does twice the work in half the time.
That's not bad.
Maybe I should write that down.
Don't worry about it.
You'll come up with something.
You always do.
Thank you.
Thank you for the encouragement.
It's nice to talk to somebody who cares.
- What, MichaeI cares.
- Yeah, MichaeI cares, about me.
It's my career he doesn't give a damn about.
I don't think he likes it when I bring my work home.
Yeah?
Well, what's his problem?
I mean, it's not like you work at the morgue.
Oh, Tony.
It's just I think he'd rather I stay home.
Quit my job, and maybe stay here and cook and clean- You know, a lot of people do that.
Hey, look, I'm just the ex-housekeeper here but I think you're perfect just the way you are.
- Perfect?
- Well, yeah, you know, perfect.
I mean, all you need now is riding stables a swimming pooI, a place for my polo pony - Great dinner, Angela.
- Thank you.
Potatoes were fantastic.
Too bad the casserole blew up.
It's all right.
The oven cleans itself.
- MichaeI- - Angela- - Go ahead.
- No, no, no.
Please, after you.
MichaeI, speak!
Well, Angela there is this expedition that's going to Zimbabwe.
- And?
- And my company's asked me - to recommend somebody to film it.
- And?
And there are a couple of guys who could do it but there is one guy who could really pull it off.
You're leaving.
Angela, I love you, but you know how hard it is for me to sit behind a desk?
My only reason for being here is to be with you.
But if you're so busy and I love what you're doing, that you can't be with me then I'd rather be where I'd rather be.
So I'm going to Zimbabwe.
MichaeI, I can't believe this.
I was just going to say the same thing.
- You're going to Zimbabwe too?
- No, no.
No, no, no, I mean about us.
It can't work, I agree.
Angela, you don't have to say this just to let me off the hook.
- No, no, I mean it.
- If you're sore and angry, I understand.
No, no, no, I was going to dump you first.
Really?
Really, it doesn't matter who was going to say it first but the point is, it's over.
I mean, we could try to make it work.
I could quit my job, ask you to stay.
I think we'd both resent it and then we'd end up hating each other.
And I love you much too much to ever let that happen.
I'm awfully glad we tried again.
- Could we tell Jonathan together?
- Yeah, I'd like that.
I've been putting this off for a long time - where are those divorce papers?
- They're upstairs in the bedroom.
- Want to go sign them right now?
- Let's go.
Well, why don't I go upstairs and bring them down myself.
Come in.
It's open.
Hi.
Tony.
Well, hi.
What are you doing here?
I stopped around to see how you were doing.
Oh, me?
I'm great.
I'm fine.
- So MichaeI's gone, huh?
- How did you know?
He called me.
He called me to say goodbye.
- Told me I should take care of you.
- What did you say?
I told him you could take care of yourself, that's what.
Well, yeah, you're right.
Thanks a lot, Tony.
He agreed with me.
But obviously we were both wrong.
Look at this place.
It's a pit.
You're a lousy folder too, Angela.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
Does this mean you're back?
Yup?
Well, I didn't ask you back.
Well, MichaeI did.
And he said I should start right away.
- What else did MichaeI say?
- He said I got a raise.
A big one.
All right, Tony, I said I was sorry.
- I thought the ball was long.
- It was a drop shot, Angela.
Well, he disguised it well.
I'll just have you know, you cost us the match.
Now I know why they tell you never to play doubles with your housekeeper.
Oh, boy, do I love winning.
You and your partner.
I've never seen anything like that guy.
Gee, he's the most competitive, vicious tennis player I ever saw in my life.
You'd think the guy was at Wimbledon the way he was diving for those balls.
Great game, Leo.
Nice playing with you.
Well, that was very nice of him, Leo.
Nice guys finish last, sir.
Leo, let's go up to my place and pop some champagne, huh?
I hope you didn't hurt anything when you leaped over the net.
Tony, I have to hand it to you.
You really are a good sport.
- I am, huh?
- Tony, where are you going?
Outside to steaI the hubcaps off that guy's Bentley.
- Tony!
- What?
- Can I help?
- You bet.
Come on.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Well, you're doing a great job with that map, honey.
What's it made out of?
Flour, water, and salt.
Yeah, and garlic and a pinch of oregano.
It's a map of Italy.
- Hi, extended family!
- Hi.
Guess what?
- What?
- Look, Mom.
Oh, honey, what a nice boot.
I am going to be on television.
- When?
- You're kidding.
No.
Eye on Hartford wants to do a story on me.
You know, busy career woman, still has time for home and family.
- But, Mom, it's not a- - Not now, sweetheart.
I'm talking.
Maybe you should call Mommy's appointment secretary.
I'm sorry, honey.
What did you want to show me?
See, it's a map of Italy.
Well, yes, indeed, it is, and it looks very authentic.
- It even smells authentic.
- Oregano.
- Anything else you wanted to show me?
- No.
You can talk about yourself now.
- Thank you.
Where was I?
- Eye on Hartford.
I love that lady that does that show, Bobbie Barnes.
She does these wonderfuI interviews with witty, fascinating people.
And they're not doing that anymore?
I'm telling you, it's a great show.
And each segment takes 12 minutes.
I can time my muffins by them.
They sent a film crew over to the office this afternoon.
And while they were there, I approved the storyboard for Alfalfa Puffs I dealt with a personneI crisis between two vice presidents then I fielded phone call after phone call.
Sometimes, even two at once.
My God.
They can show that on television?
Keep it up.
I won't let you stay tonight when Bobbie Barnes comes over.
- What?
- Wait a minute.
Bobbie Barnes is coming here tonight?
She's coming over to set things up, meet my family, check out my home.
Angela, I'm your housekeeper.
I think I should have received prior notice on her arrivaI.
Gee.
- Don't worry.
The house looks fine.
- I know that.
I was wondering, maybe I should get a haircut.
There she is.
Okay, everybody act naturaI, okay?
How's this?
Compared to what?
Miss Barnes, please come in.
I'm looking for Angela Bower.
I'm Angela Bower.
Remember, we spent five hours together in my office today?
- Alfalfa Puffs, corporate decisions - Oh, right.
You look so different without a phone in your ear.
You have a beautifuI home.
Is it paid for?
You can get back to me on that one.
And I suppose this is your husband?
Would you like to get back to me on that one too?
No, no.
Miss Barnes, I'm Tony Micelli.
I'm the housekeeper here.
Of course you are.
And I'm Geraldo Rivera.
Miss Barnes, I'd like to introduce you to the rest of the family.
Bobbie Barnes, this is my son Jonathan.
Well, Jonathan, how do you feeI about your mommy being on Eye on Hartford?
Grandma says it's just a locaI show.
But a very good one.
Hi.
I'm Mona Robinson.
- Yes, this is my mother.
- Well, we all have to be something.
My goodness, you look different on television.
I guess those bright lights really do wash the wrinkles out.
Next- Next, we have my housekeeper's daughter, Samantha Micelli.
Why, Samantha.
My goodness, this must be a speciaI occasion for you getting to sit in the living room with the rest of the family.
Yes.
If she eats all her grueI we let her sit on the couch for 10 minutes.
- Hey, Miss Barnes, let me- - Please, call me Bobbie.
Yeah?
Okay, Bobbie.
I want you to know, I catch your show every day on my kitchen TV.
You know, I pass the time while my dough is rising.
Miss Barnes, don't you have any questions you'd like to ask me?
As a matter of fact, I have.
Where did you find this housekeeper?
Mom, do we have to stay here for this?
No, you can go and watch some television.
- Goodie!
- Public television.
You said we could watch Nightmare Theatre.
- No, no, darling.
- But they're playing Valley Ghouls.
That's enough.
Sweetheart.
Come on, Jon, let's go upstairs and play Scrabble.
It's an educationaI game.
She's cute, my daughter.
Now that the kids are gone, who cares who found him?
Who gets him now?
Hey, look, Bobbie, around here, I keep house.
I don't play it.
Oh, what a waste.
Well, I suppose we should save some of this excitement for tomorrow.
I'll be by in the morning with the crew, and we'll follow you as you start your dreary day.
Could you spice it up a little tomorrow, Eleanor?
- Angela.
- I guess it's too late to change it.
Come on, Prudence.
Let's tak e a shortcut through the galleria.
Oh, totally awesome.
No!
No, no, Prudence!
Don't go through the galleria.
This movie is stupid.
You can't cut someone's throat with a credit card.
- I'm going to bed.
- Good night, sweetheart.
Good night.
And remember, the ghouls may be dead or they may be moving to a shopping mall near you.
Holy mackereI.
Man, that was scarier than I thought.
- You sure you're gonna be okay?
- Me, afraid of ghouls?
Come on, Dad.
I had Sister Mary Theresa for math.
Angela.
Angela, I was thinking, perhaps I should spend the night over here.
I mean, it's such a long way home.
Mother, your apartment is across the driveway.
Angela, if she's scared, let her stay here.
I- I'm not scared.
I just thought it would be nice to be here in the morning when the TV people come.
I should have known.
Of course you can stay.
- I'll take the couch.
- You don't have to do that.
There's a double bed in my room.
Mother!
No, I meant I'll take Jonathan in my room, and she can have his.
Well, that's not the best offer I've ever had but then, of course, it's not the worst, either.
Mother.
Are you sure you're really not scared?
No, I'm not scared.
I just want to be here with my family just in case a bat flies in the window and starts sucking blood from my neck.
Mother!
No!
No, don't go through the galleria.
No.
No!
Dad?
Dad, can I sleep in here?
What are you doing here?
Where am I?
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.
I had a nightmare.
Jonathan, you look terrible.
Get some sleep.
Angela.
Angela.
Yo, Angela!
What?
What is it?
What's the matter?
I had a bad dream.
Can I sleep with you?
Yeah, sure, honey.
Come on.
Climb in.
Samantha, honey.
Honey, you want to I'll go sleep in her room.
Tony.
Tony.
Watch out for the credit card.
No, watch out.
What?
What is it?
What's the matter?
Samantha had a nightmare.
- She wants you to sleep with her.
- Oh, yeah?
I'd better go check on her.
- You go and get some sleep, Jonathan.
- Thank you.
Okay.
I'll go see how she is.
Sam?
Sam, honey, it's me.
I'm here, babe.
It's all right, sweetheart.
It's okay.
It's all right.
Oh, hi.
Come on in.
Is your mom here?
- Is your mom here?
- She's upstairs.
Okay.
Well, I suppose we might as well go up and see how our career girI starts her day.
Does she floss before or after brushing?
I can't wait to find out.
Ted KoppeI never had to put up with this.
Good morning, Tony.
Morning, Angela.
- What are you doing here?
- Nothing, I swear.
What are you doing here?
Samantha had a nightmare, and she crawled into bed with me and then she took all the covers, so I took her bed.
Jonathan told me she had a nightmare.
I came here to comfort her.
- She's in my bed.
- Well, I didn't know that.
I came here, it was just a lump under the covers.
Don't you think that my lump is different than hers?
I'm gonna pass on that one.
Come on, Angela, it was just an innocent mistake.
I guess you're right.
It'll be our little secret.
When I saw you, I just - You know what?
I'll tell you what.
- What?
I'll go downstairs and make you your favourite Belgian waffles.
Great.
I just love when you put whipped cream on them.
Good morning.
We- We'll be right back.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Don't go away.
What are we going to do?
Did you ever jump from a second-storey window?
No, but it's never too late to learn.
What's going on here?
It's early in the morning, and we're outside the bedroom of plucky career gaI Angela Bower who just made an appearance with her housekeeper the very attractive Tony Micelli.
Well, I'll be darned.
Good morning, Connecticut.
Here they are now.
Well, good morning, Angela.
You certainly look chipper.
Would you like to tell us how you start your day?
Well, you're really going to laugh when you hear this.
You'd better hope so, dear.
When Tony crawled into bed with me he thought he was getting into bed with somebody else.
Oh, you did spend the night together.
- What a nice tattoo.
- Thank you.
No, no.
In fact, we all watched a scary movie together last night and then her mother stayed over.
Oh, you thought you were getting into bed with her mother?
This may be too tacky, even for me.
No.
Well, Goldilocks, who's been sleeping in your bed?
Look, Miss Barnes, you know, you march in here with your cameras and turn a harmless family situation into something fouI and unspeakable.
I mean, sure we were in the same room but even the constitution guarantees freedom of assembly.
America has had enough of your yellow television.
I think this interview is over.
What do you have to say about that?
My, didn't we get up on the wrong side of the bed this morning.
- Did you get in touch with your lawyer?
- I told him the whole ridiculous story how nothing was happening and she maligned us.
- What did he say?
- "Get out of town.
" And I might as well too.
When the TV show airs, there'll be a big scandaI.
I'll be drummed out of the advertising business.
Come on.
How bad could it be?
How many people watch some little TV station from Connecticut?
Not more than two or three million.
Everyone will think I slept with my housekeeper.
- You could do worse.
- And has.
If my office calls would you please tell them that I'm on my way?
I guess the Belgian Waffles are out, huh?
Miss Barnes, about this morning.
You're trying to get me not to air that tape, aren't you?
I was hoping you'd see- If you're thinking of coming on to me, forget it.
It won't work.
- Well, I wasn't going to do that.
- Okay, it might work.
Miss Barnes, you can't air that tape.
Tony, I am a journalist.
People want to know the truth.
That's it.
The truth is nothing happened.
They don't want to know that.
What about Angela, though?
What about her feelings?
I mean, she's a nice person.
This is going to ruin her career.
Doesn't that mean anything to you?
Actually, not a heck of a lot.
My, my, my.
If it isn't Brenda Starr.
Have you two reached some sort of an agreement?
We might have if you hadn't walked in.
Tony, I have a window that's stuck in my apartment.
- Could you open it for me?
- Mona, it's the middle of the winter.
Yes, but I thought if you started now, it'd be ready for spring.
Oh, I get it.
So, yeah, I'll go fix the window so you two can have a little chat.
This should be better than mud wrestling.
See you.
Well, I'll be going too.
Must you?
We have so much to talk about.
- We do?
- Yes.
Yes, we do, Bobbie.
You see, I was just down at the station talking to the generaI manager.
Handsome deviI, huh?
And you know, Bobbie, I just couldn't help thinking that I've seen him somewhere before.
Mona, it's no good.
I have complete autonomy over the content of my show.
That's exactly what he said.
Well, then I think that brings this conversation to a close.
Okay.
Let's talk about something else.
How about Stowe, Vermont?
You see, I just remembered where I had seen him.
Stowe, Vermont.
Have you ever been there?
- Get to the point, Mona.
- I think I'm there, Bobbie.
And so were you.
Isn't that a coincidence?
When was that?
Let me see Oh, yes, that was way, way back when you were a weather bunny.
I was a meteorologist bunny.
Whatever.
And also, that was just about a month before you got your own show.
Another coincidence.
But of course, the generaI manager, your boss was probably there with his lovely wife and two adorable children.
I wonder if I should go back and ask him.
What do you think?
You want to get back to me on that one?
Yo, Angela, come on.
Hurry up.
It's almost time for Eye on Hartford.
Do I have to watch?
Come on, sit down.
Look here.
The condemned woman ate a hearty cookie.
How can you be so calm?
Well, it's not my disgusting personaI life that's about to hit the airwaves.
Hello, and welcome to Eye on Hartford.
Tonight, we'll be taking a close look at some of the bizarre sexual habits of a well-known Connecticut native Mother, hold my hand.
the praying mantis.
Right after this word from our sponsor.
What happened?
What happened?
Where's my disgusting life?
Mona, what went on here today with Bobbie?
Bobbie was here today?
What happened?
Angela, you just have to know how to talk to people to be tactfuI and persuasive, and a little blackmaiI doesn't hurt.
Mona, you're terrific.
You're terrific.
And so sneaky.
And you let us go through that?
- Why didn't you tell us?
- What?
And ruin all my fun?
Well, I must say, I'm just glad they didn't air it.
- Thank you, Mother.
- Angela, you're my daughter.
Do you think that I'm going to sit idly by while someone makes your life miserable?
That's my job.
Oh, Mother.
This is Bobbie Barnes bidding a fond farewell to our friend the praying mantis and all of Connecticut's other kinky little critters.
And you know who you are.
See that, Angela?
She mentioned you after all.
You know, Tony, we never really did talk about last night.
Well, come on.
Hey, Angela, come on.
I was half asleep.
I walked into the room, you were all curled up underneath the covers there.
You looked so cu- Curled up.
- I was completely under the covers?
- Oh, yeah, completely.
Anyway, when I got in, I stayed on my side of the bed.
- How do you know that?
- What do you mean?
How do you know you didn't roll over or something?
I didn't.
That's how come I know.
I didn't.
Anyway, how do you know you didn't roll over or something?
I didn't.
- Can we just drop this?
- Of course.
- What?
- Nah.
- What is it?
- Nah.
What?
Did you dream anything?
Well, I don't remember.
No, I guess not.
- Did you?
- Me?
I don't dream.
I don't dream.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Okay.
Is that better?
Just a little more water.
Hi.
How you doing?
Did you win the game?
I think so.
Somebody did.
You have a brush?
Bobby and Dad's outside.
Yeah.
Just hold on a second.
Here you go.
What's going on?
I'm sure Bobby's gonna ask me to the schooI dance.
- How do you know?
- He told Leslie's brother who told Leslie, who told ShirI, who told Marci not to tell.
So who told you?
Frank Liberman.
Don't ask me how he found out.
He was gonna ask me at the bottom of the ninth, but then Dad came over.
Oh, that's too bad.
He was gonna ask me in the car, but Dad was there.
So I think he's gonna ask me now.
- I just hope Dad'll let me go on a date.
- Don't worry, I'll take care of him.
- Thanks.
- Yeah.
- Okay.
How do I look?
- Great.
I got a feeling about this season.
Pennant fever!
Bulldogs!
Bulldogs!
Are we tough?
Bulldogs!
Bulldogs!
Rough, Rough, Rough!
Hi, Bobby.
I take it you guys won the game.
Yeah, but one of us got tossed out for lifting his leg on the umpire.
- Grover would never do that.
- Come on, Grove.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
- You looked good out there today.
- Really?
You think so?
- Everybody drops five or six balls.
- In one inning?
- You'll do better next week.
- Oh, I hope so.
You know, it's rough out there when your mother starts booing you.
Well, look, Bobby, beginning of the season, we're all a little rusty.
What we need is some practice.
We'll go out and shag some balls.
Tony, they just played an entire ball game.
Maybe they're tired or thirsty, or maybe they'd like some refreshments.
Yes, I'm reaI thirsty.
Dad, why don't you make us egg cremes?
Egg cremes.
My dad makes the best egg cremes.
- I'll show you how to make them.
- Tony, I've got a better idea.
Why don't you make them and then bring them out and surprise us?
Oh, okay.
Hey, I'll be back in a wink with the drinks.
You get it?
Well So, Bobby what do you think of Scranton's idea about the schooI dance?
I think that's an idea whose time has come.
- Nice rug.
- Yeah.
- You okay?
- No sweat.
You know about Old Lady Scranton's dance on Friday?
Yeah, Bobby?
Well, I was just wondering I thought maybe, well Could I use your bathroom?
Tony, how do you How do you feeI about dating?
I don't know.
I think things are pretty good the way they are.
Not with us.
I'm talking about Samantha.
Samantha?
Get out of here.
She's just a kid.
Hi.
How'd the game go?
Forget the game.
A 12-year-old shouldn't be dating.
Okay.
I'll call him back and say no.
Tony, it's just a little dance, and all the kids are going some of the parents are chaperoning, and some of the boys are asking girls.
Samantha's first date!
Oh, I can't wait.
Yeah?
Well, you're gonna have to, because she ain't going.
Come on.
She is not that young.
Look at Romeo and Juliet.
- How old do you think Juliet was?
- Forty-one.
No.
No, Tony, she was 14.
No, no, no.
Not in the production at the Brooklyn "Y".
Mrs. Rossini played Juliet.
Boy, you really do miss a lot by not living in the city.
Oh, Tony, come on.
I remember when I was 12 years old No, that would not be a good example.
Look, look, even at this age, a boy's only got one thing on their minds and it ain't the foxtrot.
No boy's making no move on my Sam.
- No way, no how, never.
Never.
- Oh, Tony, come on.
Bobby is such a sweet boy.
Bobby?
Bobby "toss me an easy one" Michelson?
- Yeah.
- You're kidding me?
- No.
- That's great.
That's terrific.
- Sam can go out with him anytime.
- Did I miss something here?
Of course not.
I know that kid.
He's not making no move.
At least not untiI his wedding night, and even then, he's gonna whiff.
Boy, that's a really nice bathroom you got.
We like it.
The thing is, is the other guys well, not all the other guys, but the really " happening" guys see, they're asking girls to this dance and my mom says I have to go anyway, so- Hey, Bobby!
That's terrific!
That's terrific.
You asked Sam to the dance.
- Dad, he didn't.
- Oh, he didn't.
- She is right, Coach, but I almost did.
- Yes, I'd love to, Bobby.
Sam, wait a minute.
Would you wait till the pitch is over the plate?
You gonna pitch or what?
Come on.
Sam, about the dance on Friday night, Herbie Watts was going to ask you.
- He was?
- Yeah.
We had to flip for you.
- I'm glad you won.
- I didn't, I lost.
I had to pay him $1.50 just so I could ask you.
I'm glad he didn't want more because I'd have had to use my lunch money and I was hungry.
See, they were having Sloppy Joes- - Bobby, just ask me!
- Would you like to go?
- Yes!
Wasn't that easy?
You know, your wedding night might not turn out so bad after all.
- That must be Sam's date.
- Okay, okay.
Now, wait a minute.
Let me get ready.
Okay, okay.
Hey!
Oh, Bobby!
Oh, Bobby.
Take it easy, Bobby.
You stepped on your flowers - but they're good as new.
- Thank you, Mr. Micelli.
" Mister"?
" Mister"?
What happened to " Coach"?
Oh, I don't know.
Tonight seems kind of speciaI.
Well, if you're looking for a Lowenbrau, forget it.
Bobby, this is Jonathan, Jonathan, this is Bobby.
I'll tell Sam you're here.
So you're taking Sam out?
- Yes.
- Why?
- How old are you, kid?
- Eight.
You would never understand.
What makes you think so?
Because I'm 12, and I don't.
Hey, hey, hey, guys.
Well, Sam's not ready.
You know how women are.
You can't live with them, you can't live without them.
Sit down over there.
Samantha, I thought maybe you might like to wear this pin.
My mother bought this for me when I was just about your age.
Oh, an antique.
Well, I guess it is getting there.
I wore it on my first date.
I let Angela wear it on her first date.
If this pin could talk.
If it could, would I be giving it to a little girI?
Okay, you all set?
- No.
- Why?
- What's the matter?
- What are we gonna talk about?
Well, what do you usually talk with him about?
Dad usually does the talking.
I mean, it seems like Dad's always there.
Well, he won't be there tonight.
You're on your own, kiddo.
That's right.
I'm on my own.
Finally, I get to be alone with a man.
Would you like a candy mint?
It's also a breath mint.
Bobby, would you relax?
Everything's gonna be fine.
But what are Sam and I gonna be talking about?
These things are kind of hard to plan in advance.
I didn't think I was gonna have anything to say on my first date with Jo Ann Banjabani.
But then I closed the car door on her leg, and it loosened her up.
She had plenty to say all the way to the emergency room.
Bobby, here's your flowers.
Here.
Here, Bobby.
Hi, Sam.
Samantha.
You look terrific.
- I wouldn't have even known it was you.
- Thanks.
Hey, all right.
Hold on.
That's good.
That's good.
Dad, what are you doing?
Just one more of you coming down the stairs.
That's good.
I guess you're off.
I just need one more picture of Bobby and Samantha.
Stay there.
- Smile.
That's good.
- Okay, okay.
That's enough pictures.
I just need one more of Sam saying goodbye to Grover.
I wanna be in on that one.
Go ahead, go ahead.
- Smile.
Grove.
All right, that's a good- - Tony.
Tony.
- I think they want to go to the dance.
- Yeah, I know.
I just need one picture of Fred and Ginger.
Hey.
Fred and Ginger.
Nice smiles, now.
Don't fooI around.
Give me nice smiles.
I said a nice smile, Bobby.
- That's good.
That's great.
- No more pictures, right?
Right, no more pictures.
Give me nice smiles.
I said a nice smile, Bobby.
That's good.
That's great.
Thanks for the ride, Dad.
Hey, you know, dances at the schooI gym, huh?
That wonderfuI aroma of gardenias and sweat socks.
- Well, thanks again, Dad.
- Yeah, so long, Coach.
- We'll call you.
- No, you won't.
- What do you mean?
- You're gonna love this.
You really are.
I got a surprise for you.
- I volunteered to be a chaperone.
- A chaperone?
I'll be here all night.
Isn't it great?
Hey, kid, would you take our picture?
This is gonna be wonderfuI.
- I'm sorry about my father and stuff.
- That's okay.
I've got a couple of parents of my own.
Hey, come on.
Cheer up.
As long as we're here, we might as well dance.
Come on, it's time to get down.
- You're a pretty good dancer, Bobby.
- Thanks.
- This isn't as bad as I thought.
- Thanks.
If I had to come anyway, I might as well come with someone who wasn't you know, like, a reaI slime-bucket.
That's why I like you.
You're so sensitive.
Thanks.
- They're cute, aren't they?
- Oh, they certainly are.
I guess this Old Lady Scranton didn't have such a bad idea after all.
- Who?
- Old Lady Scranton.
A sixth-grade teacher.
My daughter's in her class.
- Oh, Samantha.
- You know her?
She's in my class.
- You're - Old Lady Scranton.
But you can call me Lois.
I'm " Big Mouth" Micelli, but you can call me Tony.
About that "Old Lady" stuff, Sam really does like you.
I find that nicknames are the highest form of flattery.
Take Mean Joe Green Maybe that's not a good example.
No, that's a fine example.
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, guys.
Guys, why don't you leave some for somebody else?
Would you like some punch, Mr. Micelli?
Hey, you can call me Tony.
Sure, thanks.
So you're a teacher?
- I'm a teacher.
- You're a teacher?
When I was a kid, you had to be old and cranky and it didn't hurt if you had a moustache.
Well, you see, times are tough.
They had to lower the requirements.
So no wonder Johnny can't read.
Would you like to try a slow dance?
Oh, no!
Okay, I just thought I'd ask.
Not that.
Look.
My father's talking to Old Lady Scranton.
I'm gonna die.
That's okay.
They're way in the back.
Nobody will notice them.
Now they're dancing?
Oh, that's it.
I'm dead.
You're looking at a corpse.
- Come on, Bobby.
- Wait.
I'm supposed to lead.
Well, lead me over there.
I always wanted to be a teacher.
I love kids.
Yeah?
Well, I'm a big kid myself.
- Do you have any children?
- No, I'm not married.
Oh, no?
Well, do you dip?
- Hello, Miss Scranton.
- Hi, there.
- Hi, guys.
- Dad, could I speak with you?
Sure, talk.
- It's kind of personaI.
- Oh.
- Do you mind if I dance with Sam?
- Go ahead.
Excuse me, sir, may I cut in?
- What?
- Change partners.
- Would you like to dance?
- Why, thank you, Bobby.
Don't mention it.
Please don't mention it.
- Miss Scranton's a pretty nice lady.
- She's not a lady, she's my teacher.
Oh.
You want me to you want me to cooI it with the dancing?
Yeah, Dad.
Have you tried the punch, or the cookies, or sitting in the car?
You want me to keep a- I'll keep, I promise, a low profile.
I know that it's hard to believe, but the dog really did eat my book report.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
This way.
This way.
We got a little problem here.
Oh, let me guess.
We're embarrassing the kids.
Is there some place we could fade into the scenery and talk?
Backstage.
- They're having such a good time.
- Oh, really?
At first, I was worried about Sam adjusting and fitting in.
The schools in New York are different from the ones here.
Here, the desks aren't even bolted to the floor.
You know, you really are something.
You moved out here just so your child would have a better place to grow up.
Well, that's the kind of guy I am.
Would you like to dance?
Sure.
You're a very good father.
You're a very good teacher.
This is the best parent-teacher conference I've ever had.
Me too.
Hooray for me.
I won again!
I don't wanna play anymore.
You have to learn how to lose.
I already know how to lose.
I have to learn how to win!
Well, do you want us to just let you win?
Okay.
- The debutante is home.
- Well, how was your first date?
I'm entering the convent.
I don't think it went well.
- Samantha, I said I was sorry.
- What happened?
What happened?
I am the laughingstock of the sixth grade.
Oh, come on.
Why, because I kissed your teacher a little?
You did what?
Tony kissed Old Lady Scranton?
That's funny.
But not very.
It wasn't just the kissing.
It was everything else.
Everything else?
Tony, you sound like my kind of chaperone.
Hardy-har-har.
What, the dancing?
- Dad, just forget it.
- No.
I want to know.
Tell me.
Okay.
It was the kissing and it was the dancing and it was the taking pictures.
Every time I turn around, you're there.
- Come on.
I'm just- - Why did you have to come?
Hey, hey.
Samantha.
Dad, leave me alone.
- Jonathan - I know.
Bedtime, right?
Right.
Don't worry, Tony.
I'll still like you.
Thanks, kiddo.
- Good night.
- Good night.
I don't believe it.
Sam just told me to get lost.
Oh, well, she didn't say, "Get lost.
" It felt like "get lost.
" I knew I shouldn't have let her go on that date.
Well, maybe that's the problem, Tony.
Maybe you didn't let her go.
What do you mean?
It seemed like you were hovering over her every step.
It's wrong for me to wanna be with my daughter?
No, but is it wrong for her to want to be on her own?
Tony, you have to start letting her go.
I know it's gonna be hard.
Mother and I had the same problem.
What?
Are you kidding me?
Give me a break.
I couldn't wait to cut you loose from my apron strings.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Mother, what are you talking about?
Whenever I went out with my friends, you were there.
The beach, the movies.
You even stayed up with us at slumber parties.
Well, somebody had to lead the seances.
I was one of the gang.
All the girls loved it.
No, Mother, not all the girls.
Now it comes out.
Finally, huh?
After all of these years.
Sally Watson never liked me.
No.
Mother, Sally Watson loved you.
And well she should.
I put her in touch with the spirit of James Dean.
That's not what I'm saying.
I know what you're saying.
Get out of here.
Tony, now, listen.
You've got to back off, and you have to cut Sam some slack.
Now, if you don't, one of these days, she's going to turn on you.
Just like this.
Sam, honey, it's me.
I guessed.
You guessed.
Hey, I got these two tickets to the County Fair on Saturday.
- Dad.
- Maybe you wanna take Marci or Bobby or anybody but me, because I'm busy.
Thanks, Dad.
Honey I know- I know tonight was your night.
Yeah, kind of.
- Yeah, and I stomped all over it.
- Well, a little.
I think it's great that you're the coach of my baseball team.
Yeah.
- And my soccer team.
- Yeah.
And my basketball team.
You're just like one of the gang.
Oh, boy.
You're sick of my face, huh?
No.
I like having you around most of the time.
It's just a lot of the time, you're around too much of the time.
I got it.
Hey I can't help it if I'm so overprotective.
What can I say?
I'm sorry.
I'm Italian.
And I'm sorry I yelled at you.
But what can I say?
I'm Italian too.
All right, hey, look you want me to give up the soccer team?
Gone.
Nah.
I want you to give up Old Lady Scranton.
How about baseball?
How about Old Lady Scranton?
Well, see, Sam, here's the thing.
I really- She's- - I kind of like her.
- Okay.
Hey, she won't be my teacher after June, right?
Boy, you're starting to think like a grown-up.
But Dad, untiI I get out of the sixth grade maybe you two could kind of sneak around?
Now you're really starting to think like a grown-up.
Mother, I didn't believe in seances in high schooI and I don't believe in them now.
Oh, Angela, can the gab and park your buns.
Angela, not everything in this universe is explainable.
Look at Boy George.
Oh, all right.
All right.
If I'm going to do this, I wanna contact somebody I've always admired.
What about Ghandi?
What about Elvis?
How about Uncle Vinnie?
He died owing me 20 bucks.
He'd do anything to get out of paying.
- Okay.
Good.
- You'll love this guy.
Close your eyes and concentrate.
Angela, close your eyes.
Ready?
Uncle Vinnie if you're out there, give us a sign.
Oh, okay, Mother.
This is a joke, I'm not buying it, okay?
All right.
Good night, Uncle Vinnie.
Nice to meet you.
Goodbye, good luck.
- Come out, Jonathan.
That was great.
- Come out.
Hey, hey are you guys ready to do a trick on Mommy?
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Mark Spitz and company!
Hi.
How was swimming class?
Tony gave the lifeguard mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
The lifeguard was drowning?
Well, she might have if she'd been in the water.
Angela, she was reaI close to the deep end.
What are you doing with the china?
Your father-in-law called.
Nick?
- Grandpa called from Florida?
- Called from the airport.
Guess who's coming to dinner?
I hope to hell it's Sidney Poitier.
- Grandpa's coming here?
For dinner?
- Yeah.
- Great!
- I'm glad one of you is excited.
Yeah.
Kids, why don't you go upstairs and get washed up?
Dad, we just spent an hour and a half in the pooI.
I'll turn into a prune.
He'll turn into a raisin.
Raisin.
Angela, don't you think you should have checked with me before inviting my father-in-law?
I thought you'd be happy.
Angela, look at this face.
Does this look like a happy face?
Well, you're always saying how important family is to you.
I meant my family, not my wife's family.
What did this guy do?
Give you some hard-luck story?
He said he was in town.
And you fell for it?
Last time I saw him was when my wife died.
Before that, it was under protest.
What have you got against him?
Angela, he's a mooch.
He's rude, he's insensitive.
- And he's a slob.
- Aren't you exaggerating?
The man puts Sweet'N Low in his wine.
I'll tell you right now, I'm not cooking for him.
Oh, all right.
I invited him, I'll cook.
- Angela?
- Yeah?
He's not that bad.
Now, this is probably him.
It's dinner and that's it.
Whatever you do, don't invite him to stay.
I know this guy.
He's always broke.
He'll move in, mooch off us.
Forever.
Hey, Nick, how are you?
I'm rich.
- Rich?
- Yeah.
Lousy, stinking rich.
I'm rolling in it.
What are you talking about?
Last I heard you were a lousy junk car dealer.
Well, down at the bank, they call me an "auto-parts entrepreneur".
They love me down at the bank.
- So how are you doing, Tony?
- We're doing okay.
Yeah, yeah.
I can see, I can see.
Not as good as me.
You see these shoes?
180 bucks.
Suit?
500 clams.
That's lovely.
Oscar de la Renta?
No, Nick Milano.
- Who's the skirt?
- Nick.
This person happens to be Angela Bower and she happens to be the president of the 12th-largest advertising agency in the country.
Nice legs!
- Grandpa!
- Sambina!
Come over here!
Look at you, look at you!
You're beautifuI!
- You got your mother's looks.
- Thanks.
And I got my dad's slide into second.
That's a biggie.
Now, I got something for you.
Try it on.
You don't like it, I'll buy you another one.
- I'll buy you two.
- Thanks.
All right.
It's a nice place you got here.
Maybe you're not so much of a loser.
All right, Nick.
It's her place, it's not my place.
Oh, yeah, but I mean you live with her, right?
I mean, she pays the mortgage, you get the fringe benefits.
And from where I'm standing, they look pretty good.
Nick, would you zip it up?
I'm her housekeeper.
You're her housekeeper?
Yes, he is.
He's a wonderfuI housekeeper and a wonderfuI human being.
Of course.
I'm sure you're right.
And a loser.
Tony, something smells wonderfuI.
It must be my cologne, Essence of Big Bucks.
Mona, this is Samantha's grandfather, Nick.
- This is Angela's mother, Mona.
- Oh, another lovely.
Oh, a snappy dresser.
- Oscar de la Renta?
- No, Nick Milano.
Who is this Oscar guy?
Very nice to meet you, Nick.
The pleasure is all mine.
I never go past the wrist on the first date.
Hey, you guys, wait till you see what Sam's got.
Sweetheart, this is Mr. Milano.
This is my son, Jonathan.
Oh, hey.
You're a short little fellow, ain't you?
You want to stand on my wallet?
- Are you ready?
- All right, come on, Sambina!
Show everybody what your rich grandfather got you.
Great day in the morning!
That's a mink coat.
You play your cards right, Red there could be one for you in the future.
Nick.
Excuse me.
- Isn't that a little expensive?
- No, it's a lot expensive.
And I didn't get it on no sale, neither.
I don't want you giving Sam no fur coat.
She's too young.
It's too expensive.
And anyway, if anybody's gonna give Sam a fur coat, it's gonna be me.
Hey, I admire your principles, Tony.
You go tell her she can't have it.
Dad, Grandpa said I could stay home from schooI so we could spend the day together tomorrow.
This is your dad talking, and I say you can't.
But we were gonna go to the racetrack.
Grandpa was gonna teach me how to gamble.
Want to bet?
But hey, I happen to have baked a batch of brownies so go in the kitchen and ease your pain?
- Oh, goody!
- Hey, hey, Jonathan.
Well, it's no mink coat, but I guess it's better than nothing.
Get out.
Get out of here.
You're in town one lousy day already she's acting like Zsa Zsa Gabor.
- I'll get it.
- Good.
I want to see how a pro does it.
Good afternoon.
I'm looking for Nicholas Milano.
You could have him.
I'm Nick Milano.
Who are you?
- Thomas Retsin from Rosen and Fisher.
- Oh, yeah.
Yes.
I have some papers here for you to sign.
We have to clear up your estate before- We don't want to talk out here, bother anybody.
Come into my office.
It's right out here.
Right out here.
Thanks.
Dad, there are no brownies in the kitchen.
What do you mean there's no brownies?
All right, all right, I ate them.
But they were very small.
Twenty-six brownies?
Twenty-six?
Fancy that.
I wonder if the Betty Ford Clinic handles brownie dependency.
I'm going to feeI a lot better knowing that my money's being taken care of after I You know, after I go.
It's a tough thing knowing that in two weeks you're going to You're going- You're going to I just can't say it.
Prison?
I'm not so thrilled when you say it either, you know.
Hey, lighten up.
It won't be so bad.
- So you stole a few auto parts.
- A couple.
- Cheated on your income tax.
- A little bit.
Tried to bribe a judge.
All right, he was a judge.
How was I to know he was honest?
Look, with good behaviour, you'll be out in three years.
Unless some wacko kills you.
Well, excuse me.
Have a nice day.
- What was that all about?
- Oh, just your basic moguI stuff.
Go back to your housekeeping.
Don't worry your pretty little head about it.
Okay, Daddy Warbucks.
Hey, I don't want you taking Sam out of schooI.
I want to spend time with my granddaughter.
- What's the big deaI?
- The big deaI is schooI's important.
You want to see her, see her on weekends or holidays.
- Easter's in a month.
See her then.
- Well, I don't have that much time.
- What, you gotta go back to Florida?
- No, I don't have to go back to Florida.
I'm going to I'm- I'm going to I don't want to talk about it.
Well, I do.
I want to talk about it, Nick.
All right, look, you're gonna find out about it anyway.
I am going to - To - To what?
It's horrible.
I just can't say the word.
I just can't say the word.
- Die?
- Die?
Nick, I thought you said you couldn't say it.
Well you've given me a whole new way of looking at things.
Well, what about doctors?
What do they say?
What could they say?
I mean, no doctor in the world could help me now.
Nick, I Gee, I knew you lost a lot of weight, but I had no idea.
How long you got?
Two weeks.
- It's all right.
It's okay.
- Oh, Nick!
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Right there.
Nick, I promise you this.
These are gonna be the best damn two weeks of your life Dad.
- Look - Oh, okay, sure.
Thank you very much.
Yeah, yeah.
- Okay, put your feet up.
- Sure.
That's it.
- Oh, hey, Tony - Oh, okay, okay.
That's nice, thank you.
Now, look, Nick from now on, I'm taking care of you.
You're staying here.
I don't want no arguments.
Okay.
And I think Angela would want it that way too.
- Angela!
- No, no.
Don't say nothing to her.
Come on, I don't want everybody treating me like I'm some kind of king catering to my every whim, waiting on me hand-and-foot.
- You got a match here?
- Yeah.
- Yes?
- One second.
Angela, could I speak to you in the kitchen about a matter?
What's the matter?
Angela, this is serious.
Tony, I know what you're going to say.
Look, I I know that I have a sweet tooth.
And sometimes I go on a feeding frenzy.
But I think I've got it under controI now.
Unless, of course, you've baked another batch of brownies.
Angela, this is about Nick.
He's been eating brownies too?
Angela, he's dying.
I ate 26 of them!
He's not dying from brownies, he's dying from death.
Oh, you mean he's really dying?
Yeah, so look, I hope it's okay, but I told him he could stay here.
Oh, of course.
Oh, my word, what are we going to do?
You gotta be strong and act like you don't know nothing.
I can do that.
Nick made me promise not to tell anyone.
You gotta promise you won't tell either.
- I won't, I promise.
- Okay.
Oh, Mother, Nick is dying.
Isn't it awfuI?
Nick, it's all set.
You can stay here.
- Are you sure you don't mind?
- Hey, you aren't going to be here long.
- I mean - Of course we don't mind.
We're thrilled to death.
I hope nobody minds a stogie?
No, no.
We love cigar smoke.
Although, it is bad for your health.
Not that you're worried about your health.
All right, all right.
Knock it off.
It's obvious.
Tony opened his big mouth.
I'm sorry.
I want you to forget about it.
Forget everything you heard.
I just want you to treat me like you would any other houseguest who's dying.
You know, Nick, so often people say: " If only we had known, we could have done something.
" Well, now we know.
So what can I do for you?
Let me mull that over.
Hey, Nick, I know what I could do.
Anything you want for dinner.
You name it.
- No, I don't want to put you- - Don't worry, no trouble.
But I always loved your stuffed manicotti, you know?
- That you make from scratch?
- Yeah.
And that sourdough bread you make from scratch.
And that seafood marinara you make- From scratch?
- If it's not too much trouble?
- No trouble.
Hey, look, it's 4:00.
I'll start right now.
That means we should be eating about 9:30.
- Tony, I could help.
- Oh great, great.
Make that 10:30.
I hope you don't mind if I pay you a compliment?
No, not at all.
You are one foxy old broad.
Why, Mr. Rhett, how you do carry on.
You know, I was hoping that I was hoping that we could get to know each other a little more personally, you know?
Like maybe at your place just you and me and a couple of Vic Damone records?
Well, I I do like Vic Damone.
But, Nick, we've only just met, and I don't work that fast.
Well, neither do I, as a rule but under the circumstances, I don't have much time.
Well, that's another thing.
Shouldn't you save your strength?
For what?
Oh, excuse me.
Hey, hey, wake up, wake up.
What is this?
Hey, Nick.
Jorvos alla Peru de 1979.
- That's a great wine, Tony.
- Yeah.
Hey, I bought this myself.
- Knew you were gonna like this.
- Yeah.
What a bouquet, huh?
Could you pass me the Sweet'N Low, please?
Salud.
Hey, Nick, you want anything else?
More minestrone?
More pasta?
Another loaf of bread?
No, I don't think so.
I don't think so.
I think I can wait for dessert.
I can't wait for that Zabaglione.
Mom, I guess I'm not a night person.
Can I go to bed without dessert?
I'll have two tomorrow, I promise.
Yes, sweetheart, come on.
I'll take you upstairs and kiss you good night.
- Say good night.
- Too late.
I'll be back in a minute.
I guess I gotta go to bed too.
SchooI tomorrow.
Forget schooI.
Where's your priorities?
Your grandfather wants to take you to the track.
- Okay.
I guess I'll see you tomorrow.
- You betcha.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Here's your racing form.
Study it like a good girI.
- Good night, Dad.
- Good night, sweetheart.
Weird.
Love that little squirt.
Yeah.
She loves you too, Nick.
One of these days, we're gonna have to tell her.
- Tell her what?
- The truth.
Well, I mean, can't you just tell her I'm going on a long business trip?
In a box?
Come on.
Are you kidding me?
She'll find out and be heartbroken because she didn't get to say goodbye.
Well, I don't want to talk about it, Tony.
Well, I do want to talk about it.
You know, last time we needed to talk and we didn't.
You mean when Marie died?
Nick, that was a really tough time for both of us.
We should have been there for each other but it didn't work out that way.
Well, I I lost my little girI.
I didn't I didn't think anybody knew what that felt like.
I knew.
Hey, and now you're gonna be with her again.
That's how I try to think of it.
Come on.
Cut it out, will you?
No, I'm serious, Nick.
I'm I don't know, I feeI kind of great about somebody being up there to look over Marie again.
Watch out for her, you know what I mean?
I can't do this.
Do what?
I'm not gonna die!
Nick, I read the book.
You're just going through the deniaI stage.
Hey, look, I know it's tough, but you've gotta face the truth.
I'm telling you, I am not going to die.
I am going to To prison.
- Prison?
- Prison, the slammer, the big house.
The joint.
Oh, hey.
Hey, oh.
What are you saying?
- You know those auto parts?
- Yeah.
You could fry eggs on them.
You ain't gonna die?
You're not dying, and you put us all through this?
I can't believe I actually hugged you.
I don't know how this thing got started.
I'm sorry.
You're sorry.
You're sorry, huh?
That supposed to cover everything, Nick?
All right, that's it, you.
You're out of here, man.
Now.
Does that mean I don't get any Zabaglione?
I'll give you Zabaglione/ All right, Angela, I'm history.
Wha-?
What?
No.
Tony, what happened?
Is he going to the hospitaI?
He is if he's not out of here in 10 minutes.
What are you talking about?
He said he's dying to cover up that he's going to prison.
- Prison?
- Prison, the slammer, the big house.
The joint.
Oh, no.
Oh, that poor man.
He was so ashamed of going to prison that he would rather have people think he was dead.
Isn't that noble?
The man is scum.
I thought I was I really thought I was finally getting along with him.
Oh, Tony, you were.
Yeah, well, it was all a big lie, Angela.
So what do you want to do?
Forget everything you said and wait untiI he's really dying - so you can start all over again?
- Why not?
Well, he's your wife's father.
He's your daughter's grandfather.
Doesn't that mean anything to you?
All right, Angela, I'll talk to him.
All right, let's get one thing straight.
You are slime.
- Yeah, I know, I know.
- Unfortunately, you're family slime.
Why'd you do what you did?
Seemed like a good idea at the time, that's all.
Look, if I told you I was going to jaiI, you would have thought I was a bum.
- This way, you thought I was a big man.
- Wait a minute.
You were worried about what I thought?
Remember me?
The one you're always calling a loser, not good enough for your little girI.
Nobody was good enough for my little girI.
At least you got that right.
Now that I think about it you came pretty close.
I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that, Nick.
Let me have that, huh?
You ready for some Zabaglione?
You know, I also like those little cannolis you make, you know?
- From scratch?
- From scratch, yeah, from scratch.
Tony, I am turning over a new leaf.
I'm telling you, starting right now- Thank you.
Starting right now I'm gonna tell everybody the truth.
Sam, everybody.
- Nick, could I talk to you?
- Oh, yeah, sure, sure.
Nick, I've thought about our conversation and I have reached my decision.
How could I deny a dying man his last request?
Last request?
Mona, I think Nick has something to tell you.
Tony!
Tony!
Son, son!
- Nick.
- No, wait.
Couldn't I turn over a new leaf tomorrow, huh?
Say yes.
Say yes!
Say yes!
Oh, thanks, son!
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Angela!
Angela, it should fit.
It says right here: "Suitable for any style sofa, from Sears Best to Louis XIV".
Oh, Mother.
I hope it wasn't a mistake taking this account.
How do you market an obscure, ugly product that no one has ever heard of?
Hey, you got the Beeman no-slip slipcovers, huh?
- You heard of them?
- Heard of them?
They're great.
Everybody in the old neighbourhood has got these.
These are great.
In the summertime, you can blow these up and take them to the beach.
Hey, Mom, I've got something great for show and tell.
Well, that's nice, sweetheart.
What is it?
Here.
Oh, my God!
What is that?
A tattoo, Mom, just like Tony's got.
Watch her wiggle.
Well, maybe when I'm older.
Where did you get that?
Did you get drunk on shore leave?
Did you do that to him?
It's just a little decaI.
It's gonna wash right off.
Jonathan, go right upstairs and take that off.
I do not want that shown and told.
Well, what am I gonna take?
Oh, darling, why don't you take this lovely authentic Chinese carving?
Do you get egg roll with that?
Hey, can I take Tony's baseball cap from the big leagues?
- You got it, paI.
- All right!
The kid idolizes me.
But who could blame him?
- Tony.
- Yeah?
If he ever comes home with a reaI tattoo- We'll make sure it says " Mom.
" Hi, guys.
Hey, Tony, watch this.
Sam, hit me as hard as you can.
Yeah?
Okay.
Not there, here.
Oh, hey.
Have you been doing a lot of sit-ups?
That's pretty good.
No, look.
I really fooled you, didn't I, Tony?
Yeah, yeah.
Where'd you get that hubcap?
Me and Joey Dinkman found it.
You found it?
Found it where?
In the street.
Yeah?
Right by the curb.
Yeah?
- On a car.
- Oh, Jonathan!
You stole it?
Well, it's not really stealing.
It's- It's a prank.
It's a prank.
Yeah, yeah.
Like the prank Jesse James played on the Missouri Railroad?
- Yeah.
- Sit down, sit down!
Jonathan, when you take something that belongs to somebody else that is stealing, and it's wrong.
Now, where'd you ever get a dumb idea like this?
From you.
What do you mean?
I never told you to do that.
Remember?
You and your friends ripping off the street signs?
He's got you there, Dad.
Jonathan, when I did that I was nothing but a dumb kid.
That's what I am.
Jonathan, when I did it, it was stealing too.
And let me tell you something.
My old man made me sweat out a whole night in jaiI for that.
Here, Sam, want a hubcap?
No way.
I'm not gonna be your fence.
All right, I'll tell you what.
First thing tomorrow morning we're going to the police station to tell them what you did.
Try and find out who this belongs to.
It sort of belongs to them.
You stole this from a police car?
Well, not the reaI police.
The Oak Hills PatroI.
Are they gonna put me in jaiI?
It's a first offence.
Are you gonna do this again?
No, never, I promise.
- I'm sorry I did it this time, Tony.
- All right, I know you are.
Look, you go up in your room and you think about what you did.
And, hey, that Dinkman kid, he's out, he's off-limits.
Could you believe this?
Yeah.
The Oak Hills patroI drive Mercedes.
Sam, what do you think?
How am I gonna tell Angela about Jonathan?
You mean Babyface Bower?
I know she's gonna come down hard on him and he got that whole dumb idea from me in the first place.
Why don't you do what me and Mom used to do?
- What was that?
- Don't tell.
When did you do that?
Remember when I broke the window at St. Catherine's?
- No.
- See, it works.
- Hi.
- Oh, hey, Angela, hi.
What happened to " Hi, extended family, I'm home"?
Beeman "the Bland", the slipcover man hated every bright idea that we presented to him.
We scheduled an meeting tomorrow to beg him to give us another chance.
I don't think things could get any worse.
Want to bet?
Kids.
I just want to go upstairs, take a hot bath, forget about my day.
How are things around here?
Why do you ask?
No reason.
Why do you ask why I ask?
No reason.
Things are, you know, the same around here.
Same old grind.
It's so quiet around here, it's a crime.
It's more like a prank.
Hello, everybody.
Hi, Mother.
What's this?
Well, it looks like a Mercedes candy dish.
Who ate all the candy?
Oh, Angela, I gotta leveI with you.
I ate it, but I got more.
The bell.
Here you go.
It's so funky.
It looks very authentic.
Bloomingdale's.
Oh, boy.
Hi.
Hey, any chance you're organizing a neighbourhood watch?
- No.
- You're collecting Toys 4 Tots?
- Is this the Bower residence?
- Yes, it is, officer.
I'm Angela Bower.
What can I do for you?
What have you got there, ma'am?
It's candy.
Would you like some?
Rather unusuaI candy dish.
Yes, it is, isn't it?
I used to have a set of four.
You did?
Okay, lady, you want to give me back my hubcap?
What hubcap?
- Oh, my God.
This is a hubcap?
- My hubcap.
Yeah, well, look, here you go.
Thanks for stopping by.
Keep the candy.
Don't worry about it.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
What's going on around here?
At approximately 3:45 this afternoon as I was emerging from the croissant shop your son and another boy absconded with two of my hubcaps.
Oh, no, officer, there must be a mistake.
- No?
- No.
I don't know what to say.
I'm- I'm so sorry.
We're not that kind of family, really.
I am a solid tax-paying citizen.
I'm also a member in good standing of the Oak Wood Country Club.
Right, mother?
I've never seen this woman before in my life.
Mother, be serious.
We were gonna bring this back in the morning.
We?
You mean you knew about this?
Well, I guess I can overlook it this time as long as you assure me that you'll have a talk with your son.
Oh, yes, officer, I will.
Thank you very, very much, officer.
Thank you.
You knew about this and you didn't say anything.
Well, I was gonna tell you later.
Later?
When?
When Jonathan's doing Angela, pull yourself together.
I mean, the kid didn't knock over a 7-Eleven.
It's just a case of " boys will be boys.
" - Boys will be boys.
- Boys will be boys?
Jonathan!
- Can't we talk about this?
- I'm the boy's mother.
I will get to the bottom of this.
Jonathan, come down here!
I can't.
Tony told me to stay in my room.
Come on down, champ.
Sweetheart, sit down.
No, you can sit.
Sit, sit, please.
Honey, Mommy wants to talk to you.
Now, why did you steaI the hubcap, darling?
Were you troubled?
I don't think so.
Well, did something happen in schooI?
No.
It's me, then, isn't it?
I'm away from you too much, and you wanted my attention?
No, I wanted a hubcap.
- Well, so much for Psych 101.
- Mother.
Angela, here's the thing and, you know, you just might get a kick out of this.
CarefuI, Tony.
You might too.
That's enough, Mother.
Well, no, Angela, you see, I told- Come here, buddy.
I told Jonathan about the time me and Johnny Chacha took a street sign.
You stole a street sign?
Well, we didn't really steaI it.
What we did was, we moved it to a new location.
And, you know, this is the funny part.
Here, sit down.
This is where it gets funny.
See, the sign said, " Easy Access", so what we did was we nailed it under Roseanne Ladorsina's bedroom window.
Boy, I bet that did wonders for her sociaI life.
Forget about it, Mona.
Her stock soared.
Oh, I get it.
No, you don't.
Sit down.
Jonathan, we have a very serious problem here and I want you to tell me what you think I should do about it.
Send me to my room.
I mean, I did the crime, I'll do the time.
Right, Tony?
Where does he pick these things up?
Go to your room.
Angela, look, I'm sorry.
Sometimes kids get the wrong idea.
No, Tony, it's all right.
It's not your fault.
It's mine.
I should be raising my son not leaving it to someone else.
What, you don't like the way I'm handling Jonathan?
With all due respect, Tony, look at the track record.
The tattoo, the hubcap, " I did the crime, I'll do the time.
" He's talking like he's Sylvester Stallone.
- Angela, that ain't fair.
- Isn't fair.
What'd you become, an English teacher?
Tony, that isn't necessary.
Don't to talk to me like- Just a minute here.
Now, you two have got to work together.
Angela, you are in the office in New York all day.
Tony is here alone with Jonathan all day.
My work is never done.
See, the thing is that the two of you are kind of like a team.
Yeah, yeah.
I'm like the quarterback out on the field.
Yeah, and I'm kind of like the coach.
From now on, I send in the plays.
Angela, are you kidding me?
You can't run this place from there.
I run the Chicago office and I run the Los Angeles office.
Consider this the Connecticut office.
From now on, I want to be consulted about everything that concerns Jonathan.
- Come on, Angela.
- Tony, you're not the boy's father.
I am.
Wait a minute.
How am I supposed to function like this, Mona?
Every time Jonathan wants something, I gotta check with her?
I'll be calling her every five minutes.
It's gonna drive her nuts.
Well, Tony, she is the boss, huh?
So why don't you give the little lady what she wants?
Mona.
Hello?
Yes, Tony, what is it?
Angela, we got a big problem here, and I knew you'd wanna be consulted.
Well, thank you, Tony.
Fill me in.
Jonathan wants a mid-morning snack.
Does he usually have one?
Well, that all depends on how long it is before lunch.
Well, how long is it before lunch?
Oh, that's another thing, Angela.
When should I feed him?
Give him a snack, and then give him his lunch later.
Oh, now, why didn't I figure that out?
You know, you make it look so easy.
Thank you, coach.
Bye.
Anybody home?
Mr. Beeman, how nice to see you again.
Please, sit down.
Thank you.
Isn't it a beautifuI day?
- I don't like small talk.
- Me neither.
- Don't like beating around the bush.
- Neither do I. - And I don't like your advertising.
- Oh, dear.
Excuse me.
It's Saturday, and there's no secretary.
Hello?
Yes, Tony.
Yes, an apple sounds fine.
Well, then, give him a banana.
Well, what do we have?
Well, then, give him that.
Goodbye.
I'm so sorry.
There was a problem in the Connecticut office.
Where were we?
- He hates our advertising.
- Oh, that.
Don't worry, Mr. Beeman, we have something I think you're going to like.
Like it?
You'll love it.
Trust me.
It's hot, it's high-concept, it's got sizzle.
Oh, speaking of sizzle I have come up with my own slogan.
This is very catchy.
" Buy Beeman furniture covers.
" And then I thought we would show them our factory in Toledo.
That's our big one.
Yes, with the very nice smokestacks.
- Notice how well- - I'm sorry, I won't be a minute.
Hello?
Yes, Tony.
I'm in an important meeting.
Can't it wait untiI I get home?
Uh, well, did you give him a drink of water?
You did?
Tell him to hold his breath and swallow three times.
Well, did you try scaring him?
All right, all right.
Put him on.
Well, just put him on.
I'm so sorry.
Where were we?
- Hey, buddy, where you going?
- Out to play.
- With who?
- A friend.
A friend?
Not that Joey Dinkman kid?
I have to.
I promised.
I told you, that Dinkman kid's off-limits.
You hang out with him, you'll end up in big trouble.
Okay, Tony, if you say so.
That's my buddy.
Okay.
Hi, Mom.
Guess who this is?
Hello, sweetheart.
Of course you can go play with your friend.
Yes, and don't forget to wear a jacket and don't forget to look both ways when crossing.
Yes, dar- Yes, I love you too.
All right.
Bye-bye.
Mr. Bee- Mr. Beeman?
I can't go on lik e this, Claudia.
But, Rod, he means nothing to me.
Nothing.
How can you expect me to believe you?
Would these eyes lie?
- Hi, Mother.
- Oh, hi.
Just listening to the MacNeil/Lehrer Report.
Kiss me, you fool.
I've always wondered about those two.
Well, we thrashed it out with Mr. Beeman and we came up with a slogan that I think really has a nice ring to it.
" Buy Beeman furniture covers.
" Well, set that to music, you got a big hit.
The fuzz.
Where are they, Mrs. Bower?
- Who?
- Butch and Sundance.
At 4:37 this afternoon two juveniles, male Caucasian broke and entered Oak Valley Elementary.
One was Joey Dinkman, a. k. a. The Dink.
How do you know that?
Even his mother calls him that.
No, I meant how did you know it was Joey?
He spray-painted his name on all of the walls.
Bright kid.
The description of the other boy matches your son.
I'm sorry, but this time it's public property.
I'm gonna have to call the reaI cops.
You know, the guys with bullets.
Oh, my God!
Oh, no, officer.
No, there must be some mistake.
It could not have been Jonathan.
You see, Tony told him that he couldn't play with Joey Dinkman.
Joey Dinkman?
Oh, no, Mother.
I told him he could.
He called me, asked me if he could play with his little friend, and I said, "Yes.
" Angela, how could you?
I was in the middle of a meeting and I wasn't paying attention.
What kind of a parent am I?
Well, better than you think because you were smart enough to hire Tony and he was smart enough not to listen to you.
- He didn't let him go?
- That's right, coach.
This time, he called his own play and Jonathan is in his room, and he has been there all afternoon.
- He has?
- He has.
You're sure about this?
Would these eyes lie?
Hey, champ.
You still mad at me?
Kind of.
Oh, come on, Jonathan.
You know why I didn't let you play with Joey the Dink, don't you?
Because I love you.
And because I happen to know they serve broccoli at Leavenworth.
Yeah, but Joey's going to think I'm a sissy for not showing up today.
Well, he might, buddy, but you know something?
Eventually, you gotta stand up and be your own man.
I'll give you an example.
Look at me, huh?
I'm the only housekeeper on the block who don't shave his legs.
Well, wait a minute.
Except for Vivienne.
But do you think that I care what the Joey Dinkmans of the world say?
Yeah, but you're tough, and you've got a tattoo and everything.
Yeah, well, let me tell you something.
This tattoo, it doesn't make me tough.
It makes me too stupid to know any better.
Stupid and scared.
- You, scared?
- That's right, scared.
I was afraid that if I didn't do what my buddies were doing then I wouldn't have any buddies.
- I know what you mean.
- You do, huh?
But you know what I figured out?
As I grew older I learned that your true friends, the guys that really count the guys that care about you they take you for what you are and what you're not.
You get it?
And sweetheart, one other thing.
ReaI friends will forgive you, even when you've acted like a jerk.
You mean like stealing hubcaps?
Yes.
And when you say things to people that you care about that you don't really mean.
Yeah, and while we're talking when you tell stories that you should've kept your big mouth shut.
- I'd sure like to have a friend like that.
- Yeah, me too.
Yeah, me too.
Hey, let's put an ad in the personals.
Hey, hey, what are you doing?
You know, Tony I'm not without understanding in these matters.
It was just a childhood impulse, and everybody's had them.
Everybody?
Yes, Tony, even me.
Oh, I remember one time at Miss Prescott's day schooI I'm all ears.
All the girls hated Miss Prescott so one day I sneaked into her classroom.
- And?
- And I ran up to her desk and I tore the day's page off her calendar.
You didn't?
Oh, I did.
And even though it was Monday she kept thinking it was Tuesday all day long.
Oh, I get it.
She probably got confused, and missed a lot of appointments, huh?
No, but she might have.
Angela, can I go to bed now?
- You madcap prankster, you.
- Well Hey, what's this on your shirt?
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Five, four, three, two, one.
- Now!
- Go, go, go, go.
- All right!
- Ready?
- Ready.
- Here we go, guys.
- Here we go.
- They look so good.
Get in there.
Perfect.
Perfect.
I want you to know I could not have done this without you.
Fresh blueberry muffins, what a wonderfuI way to start the day.
- Not your day.
- How come?
These are for Sam.
Her sixth grade bake sale.
Dad, this is Connecticut.
It's a patisserie sale.
Oh, excuse me.
" Patisserie.
" Well, they certainly look good.
- Walnuts?
- Macadamias.
Fresh blueberries?
Maybe we should let her have one.
Why, thank you, darling.
At least one of you has a heart.
That will be 50 cents.
These are delicious.
Good.
I'm glad you like them but you've got a piece of blueberry stuck between your teeth.
Oh, I'll get it.
- Hi, Marci.
- Hey, Marci.
Hi, Samantha.
Hi, Mrs. Bower.
Hello, Dr. Ferguson.
How nice to see you.
Excuse me.
I have to go use the Waterpik.
I'd better get it for you.
I was giving my gerbiI a shower.
Let's get this stuff to the patisserie sale.
My trunk's filled with chocolate chip croissants.
- Chocolate chip?
- You'd better hurry.
I don't know how long I can hold her back.
- Dr. Ferguson, this is my dad.
- Tony Micelli.
Marci told me so much about you.
You played second base for the Cardinals.
- Yeah.
Are you a baseball fan?
- The biggest.
I always wanted to be a ballplayer, but my mother said I had to be a doctor.
Tough break.
You should see my dad's baseball collection.
- Oh, yeah?
- He's got a bat signed by Willie Mays.
And a beer bottle signed by Bob Uecker.
That's nothing.
Listen to this.
My dad has got a baseball signed by all the '62 Mets.
You're kidding.
Well, my dad got it for me when I was just a little kid.
If you ever wanna part with it, maybe we could work out a trade.
How about a free triple bypass?
Tempting, very tempting.
Did you ask your dad to sign the permission slip?
What permission slip?
Well, Dad WonderfuI Dad, do you know you're my favourite father?
I'm your favourite father?
This should be good.
- Okay, Sam, what is it?
- Well Okay, here it goes.
Can I join the ski club?
It's gonna be great.
We're going to Vermont over Easter vacation and staying at the San Moritz.
Oh, the San Moritz, huh?
Well, I mean, I don't know, Sam.
Oh, please, Dad?
Everyone's going.
Oh, well, Sam, skiing- Skiing's not your sport.
You slide into third, not into trees.
Let me think about it.
But Mr. Micelli, today's the last day.
Honey, if Tony doesn't want her to go, I'm sure he has his reasons, okay?
Oh, I get it.
Well, maybe we could pay for it.
No, wait a minute.
It's not the money.
I was afraid that Sam wouldn't want to miss her Easter egg hunt.
Dad, you always find all the eggs anyway.
All right, hey, you wanna go skiing?
Give me that slip.
This is gonna be great.
Schussing down those slopes with the wind in my hair putting on goggles and ChapStick.
- I can see it now.
- Go schuss, Suzy.
I always wanted to be a downhill racer.
- But your mother - Right.
Hey, can I get a ride with you guys?
Okay, but we're gonna be talking about boys.
Oh, brother.
You can sit up front with me.
We can talk about surgery.
- Bye-bye, doc.
- Bye-bye, Tony.
- Bye, Marci.
- Thank you, Dad.
- You're welcome.
- I love you.
Oh, yeah.
Much better, much better.
Yeah.
Did you wash behind your ears?
Oh, Tony, come on, I've got to catch my train.
Don't forget to pick up the dry cleaning and don't forget, this is $200 for the chimney sweep.
For the chimney sweep?
There was one other thing.
What was it?
- Take Jonathan to the Cub Scouts.
- Don't forget that either.
Hey, look at this.
$250 for one week of skiing.
$250 for a week of skiing?
That's a very good deaI.
I'd go if I were you.
" I'd go if I were you.
" I'm gonna send my daughter skiing.
Two hundred and fifty dollars.
Chim chiminey, chim chiminey Chim chim cher-ee She's going skiing 'Cause I got the money Hey, Tony, what are you doing up here?
Hi, Mone.
Sam's going skiing.
Shouldn't she start on the bunny slope?
Not here, Mona.
In Vermont.
I'm doing this so I can afford to send her.
I love ski trips.
- Oh, yeah?
I didn't know you skied.
- I don't, but I'm legend in the hot tubs.
I bet you are.
Yeah.
Hey, Mone, something's stuck here.
I don't know what it is.
Well, did you open the flue?
Yeah, but I might have knocked it closed.
I'll go down and check.
Oh, hey.
There's Mrs. Wilmington talking to her gardener, Gus.
- Only thing is, they ain't talking.
- Oh, yeah?
What are they doing?
I think he's putting in some perennials.
I never heard it called that before.
Oh, hi, Mrs. Wilmington.
Hi, Gus.
Nice hollyhocks.
Tony?
Can you hear me?
Yeah, Mone!
I don't see what the problem is.
The flue is open.
Something's stuck, Mone.
Let me give it a whack.
I'll get out now.
That did it.
Boy, it's clear as a bell now.
Mone?
Mona?
What happened?
Well, I'm all ready for Ash Wednesday.
Don't move, Mona.
Let me try to clean you up.
Oh, man.
I think I'd better take a shower.
Yeah, well, "soot" yourself.
Look at this place.
Angela's gonna kill me!
Well, you know Angela.
Maybe she won't notice.
Mona, you think- You think these chairs'll fit in the washing machine?
The rug's gonna have to be professionally cleaned.
There goes all the money I saved cleaning this dumb chimney.
So long, ski trip.
Hi, Tony.
I'm home.
Hello, Angela.
- How was your day?
Let me get that.
- Oh, thank you.
Well, it was- - What's the matter?
- It was a lot like most days.
- What's going on?
- Oh, nothing.
Same old grind.
I'm cooking up dinner.
Your favourite: rack of lamb.
I know you like that stuff.
- Sounds delicious.
- Yeah, yeah.
What are those sheets doing on the chairs?
- What sheets?
- These sheets.
- Oh, those sheets.
Let me- - Why is the rug rolled up?
- What rug?
- This rug.
Does all this have to do with the chimney sweep?
Funny you should mention "chimney sweep.
" Oh, my stars, I don't believe it.
Yeah, I'm having a hard time with it myself.
Look at this mess.
And this man calls himself a chimney sweep?
What's in a title?
That is what's wrong with America today.
Shoddy, inept work like this.
No pride in workmanship.
This is incompetence.
That's what this is.
Sheer incompetence!
" Incompetence" is such a strong word.
What would you call it?
Nice try?
Tony, what kind of an idiot would do this?
Did the man have a brain the size of a pea?
Oh, Angela, well Angela, my goodness, I guess Tony told you how we cleaned the chimney?
I beg your pardon?
- I did this.
- You did this?
Well, now, Angela, Angela, don't go crazy or anything.
The poor man was just trying to earn a few dollars so he could send his little girI on a ski trip.
Mona, forget about it.
She's right.
I'm an idiot with a brain the size of a pea.
Well, Tony I didn't mean those small little peas.
Tony, what on earth would give you the idea that you could clean the chimney?
I saw Mary Poppins three times.
I don't know.
I guess I wasn't using the old pea.
I just wanted to give Sam some of the things like Marci's father gives to her but I can't, because he's a big-time surgeon and I'm a lousy housekeeper.
Oh, Tony, you're not.
You're a wonderfuI housekeeper.
You're just a lousy chimney sweep.
Hey, guys.
I didn't do it, Mom.
I was at the Cub Scouts.
- Wasn't I, Tony?
- Yes, Jonathan.
What happened?
Did the vacuum cleaner throw up?
Sam - that was a good joke.
- Yeah.
But, the truth is, is that your dad blew it.
I think you're gonna have to forget about your ski trip.
- But, Dad, you promised.
- I know, but I ran into a little problem.
But, Dad, I told everybody I could go.
What do I say to them?
I don't know.
I guess you're gonna have to tell the truth.
We can't afford it.
- That's not fair.
- I know but I don't make the money these people make in Connecticut.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, I'm sorry too.
I'm sorry we ever came here.
Well, Angela, I'm going back to my apartment now but before I do, could I borrow a cup of granola?
Of course you can borrow a cup of granola.
You can borrow the whole bag.
Would you like to borrow a leg of lamb?
Well, that's very generous of you.
Oh- Thanks.
By the way, I'm going to bring down that shirt that you wanted to borrow.
What shirt?
Oh, yes, that shirt.
You know, that's the way we are around here.
Borrow, borrow, borrow.
I know, I know, I know, but I know what yous are up to.
It's reaI nice, but I can't take your money.
Tony, you don't have to take the money.
It's a loan.
- What kind of loan?
- A friendly loan.
No interest payments.
No interest payments?
Yeah?
When would I have to pay this back?
You wouldn't.
No interest payments, and I don't gotta pay it back?
Where were you when Uncle Vinnie's car wash went under?
Look, Angela, it just ain't right.
I can't take your money.
Now, Angela, I told you.
He's too proud to take your money - and you ought to respect that.
- Thank you, Mona.
So will you take mine?
- What are you doing?
- I'm not going skiing, that's for sure.
Well, maybe you can.
Here.
You can have all the money in my bank.
Oh, Jonathan, that's so sweet, but you don't have enough money in there.
Oh, yes, I do.
How do you want it?
Are 20s okay?
- Twenty, 40- - Where did you get all of that?
Oh, birthdays, Christmases.
You know, I haven't spent one allowance since I was three.
I guess I'm kind of a tightwad.
- Eighty, 100- - Jonathan I'm tempted, but I can't take your money.
Oh, I'm so tempted.
Well, I don't want you to leave Connecticut.
Hey, maybe you can get money the way my mommy does.
Jonathan, I don't think they'll let me be president of an advertising agency.
No.
Not that.
Mom's got this little plastic card she puts in a slot in a bank and money just comes rolling out.
Jonathan, that money's not free.
It comes from her account.
Here, Angela, taste this.
Tell me what you think.
- Does it need a little more salt?
- No.
- Does it have enough oregano?
- Yes.
- Maybe it needs a bay leaf.
- It has enough bay leaf.
- Well, then, I think it's perfect.
- As long as you like it.
Like it?
I love it.
I'll give you a $250 bonus for it.
- Angela!
- How about an advance?
Angela, look.
Come on.
Stop.
We gotta face it.
Maybe Sam's right.
Maybe we shouldn't have come to Connecticut.
I just wanted to show my daughter a better life.
And you have.
Yeah, I showed it to her.
I just can't give it to her.
I can't send her on one lousy, crummy little ski trip.
I can't give her the things that Dr. Ferguson can.
Oh, well, you can give Samantha a lot of things that Dr. Ferguson can't give Marci.
Oh, yeah?
Like what?
Well, you get to spend a lot of time with Sam.
Big deaI.
You can teach her how to bunt.
Yeah, well, lots of guys can teach their daughters how to do that.
You know, I bet Dr. Ferguson can't cook like you do.
Do you know that this is the best sauce I have ever tasted.
It's soup, Angela.
Well, it's- It's a saucy little soup.
Come on.
Don't be so hard on yourself, Tony.
There's lots of things I got that he hasn't, right?
- Right.
- I got housemaid's knee I got a beat-up old van, and I got an old ball signed by the '62 Mets.
They're all here.
Look at this here.
Marvelous Marv Throneberry.
He even signed " Marvelous.
" How do you like that?
Here's this here.
Choo Choo Coleman, huh?
Who's "Tom Atty"?
That's "To Matty.
" To Matty, my father.
"To Matty"?
Took my old man eight months to get all these signatures.
Here you go.
- I really appreciate you selling me this.
- Yeah.
See here?
Harry Chiti.
He got traded mid-season.
My old man had to go all the way to Cleveland for that one.
Cleveland.
Wow.
That's really dedication.
Yeah.
That ball- That ball represents a whole year of my father's life- Probably the best year of my father's life.
Are you sure you want to sell this?
Oh, sure.
What are you, kidding me?
I hardly ever use it.
How much do you want for it?
Well, you know, it's not that I need the money, doc.
Oh, yeah, I know that.
How about $250?
That's- That sounds just right, doc.
Really, that's perfect.
What's that?
Your hospitaI?
No, that's my mother.
I'm late for dinner.
Oh, Tony.
I think it's just wonderfuI what you did.
Thanks, Angela.
You know, it's so magicaI.
It's like Christmas.
Selling your father's baseball for your little girI's happiness and she doesn't know about your sacrifice- It's like an O. Henry story.
- Angela, get hold of yourself.
- Yeah.
- Sorry.
- Hey, but look at this.
This is great.
Are you kidding?
They're gonna have a great time.
They start over here.
Then they ski down the RaiI Splitter to there, right?
Then they go down the Flying SquirreI to there then all the way down here to Mighty Mike.
Oh, no, Tony.
They can't do that.
That's the expert slope.
Yeah, well, then they make a left turn and go right into the first aid station.
Good idea.
That's where they keep the brandy and the guys named Sven.
- Sven?
- Hi, Dad.
Hey, hey, hey, my baby.
Hey, Sweetheart.
This looks like fun.
It's gonna be great.
You're gonna have a great time.
- I don't think so.
- What do you mean?
It's great.
Heads up.
What's this?
Looks like a baseball signed by the '62 Mets.
I know it's a baseball signed by the '62 Mets.
I mean, where'd you get it?
I saw it at Marci's and I thought you might want it.
- I sold this to Dr. Ferguson.
- Yeah, and I bought it back.
I don't want you selling Grandpa's ball to send me on some crummy ski trip.
Wait a minute.
You bought it back?
Where'd you get the money to buy this?
Dad, this is Connecticut.
I have wealthy friends.
Tony, you owe me 250 clams.
I think it's time we sat down and had a little talk here.
Come on, Rockefeller.
I wanna discuss renegotiation of your allowance.
It's a pretty nice thing you did for me here, Sam.
It was a pretty nice thing you did for me too.
So, what do you think?
You think we belong in Connecticut?
- I made a list.
- Oh, yeah?
Good, because, you know, usually I like lists.
On this side, I wrote all the things I like about living here.
There's Jonathan and Angela, Mona, my friends, the nice schooI I go to- I mean, I even like my teacher.
So do I. No, I mean- But what's on the bad side?
The only bad thing is we're not loaded and I can't always have things like ski trips and riding lessons and designer underwear.
Designer underwear?
They make it, Dad, and Marci's got it.
Holy moly.
Well, you know something, Sam.
Truth is, we weren't exactly big shots in the old neighbourhood.
That's what I figure.
Hey, I'd rather be broke in a house with three bathrooms, right?
Yeah.
Less waiting.
You know, Sam, you ain't exactly a bag lady.
I mean, we ain't stone-broke.
I wasn't gonna tell you this untiI you were 16, but I think you're old enough.
When you were a baby, your mom and I started an account for you and every time somebody gave us Christmas or birthday money for you we put it in there, and then I snuck in whatever I could here and there.
I think there's about $2000 in there now.
Two thousand dollars?
I'm an heiress.
Oh, well Is it really all my money?
It's your money, and your responsibility because you proved you could handle it.
I trust you and I know someday, you're gonna do something important with that money.
All right!
I'm going skiing!
Where are they?
They should've been back from Vermont hours ago.
Relax, Tony.
They probably got stuck in traffic, or stopped for a hamburger.
Or x-rays.
Oh, I got a bad feeling, Angela.
I see- I see a fall.
I see a spill- A bad spill, and it's Sam, and I know it.
Boom.
A bad one.
Tony, don't tell me you believe in premonitions.
That's nonsense.
Now, Angela, don't be so earthbound.
See, sometimes parents have ideas about things like this.
What about the time I predicted that you would not go to the junior prom?
It just proves my point, Mother.
I did go to the junior prom.
I mean with a date, Angela.
That's them!
She's getting out of the car.
She can walk.
It's a miracle.
They must have stopped off at Lourdes.
Hey, Dad!
Oh, Sam.
- Hi, Angela.
- Hi.
Oh, Samantha, I'm just so happy you're in one piece.
Tony, you see?
I told you premonitions were ridiculous.
- What premonitions?
- Oh, I guess it's silly.
I just kept seeing this big fall-
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Yes.
Oh, hi, Ms. Wittner.
- Hi, Tony.
Is Angela home?
- Yeah.
Come on in.
Let me get her for you on the intercom.
Yo, Angela!
Ms. Wittner's here.
- She'll be right down.
- Thanks.
Wendy?
- Oh, sweetie, how are you?
- I'm good.
How are you?
Good.
Good.
What's up?
IsabeI and I are going to Taco Loco for dinner.
Wanna join us?
Taco Loco so that's where it is.
What?
Every year, my mother throws me a surprise birthday party.
Now you know and I know, and now you know I know.
What do you have to say about that?
Oh, it's your birthday.
I'm so sorry.
I forgot.
Oh, weak, Wendy.
Weak.
Well, if there is a party, I wasn't invited and if it turns out you weren't either, you'll know where to find us.
I will be with the mariachis singing " Lady of Spain.
" Oh, Wendy.
You slay me.
Oh, that's so great.
Angela?
- Angela, I need your help.
- Yes?
Which of these do you like?
I've got a date tonight.
- Right, a date.
Where are you going?
- To the Oingo Boingo concert.
Oingo Boingo, huh?
I suppose the kids really are going to be spending the night in Brooklyn?
- Yeah.
- With Mrs. Rossini?
Yeah.
Angela, what is the matter with you?
- Hi, kids.
- Mom, me and Samantha are all packed.
Suitcases.
That's a very nice touch.
I suppose Mrs. Rossini's gonna be here any minute to pick you up.
That's the plan.
We're gonna go outside and flag her down.
Grass and trees confuse her.
I'm off to the Y. I'm gonna shoot some hoops.
Hey.
Yeah, you're gonna play basketball dressed like that?
No, Angela.
When I get to the gym, I'm gonna change into sweats.
- A likely story.
What's in the bag?
- Sweats.
- And there's air in the ball.
- Oh, that's great.
You'd better keep an eye on her, Mona.
Hey, did you like that, huh?
Look what I found.
- Mrs. Rossini!
- Tony!
Sorry.
Don't tell me.
She's so liberated she got you pregnant.
Angela.
Mrs. Rossini.
What are you doing here?
Taking the kids for the night.
Remember?
We talked about it on the phone.
And she runs an advertising agency.
- Kids, we gotta go.
- Don't you wanna see my room?
Can I see it tomorrow?
Joey's gotta get the fish truck back by 6:00.
- Bye, Mom.
- Come on, Jonathan.
- I've gotta go too.
- Bye, Grandma!
Hey, Mona, keep an eye on her.
They really are going.
She really did drive to Connecticut.
That really is a fish truck.
There really isn't a party.
- Hey.
Hey, Jeff.
- What?
Good hands.
Good hands.
No wonder we buried you today.
Next week, Micelli, we go one-on-one but I gotta warn you, I played varsity at Amherst.
Amherst.
How many other girls were on the team?
That's cute.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
We need a couple of guys to do some drinking.
How about it?
Don't say a word.
I think this is entrapment.
No we're demonstrating to the locaI teens the effects of drinking on driving.
We're gonna be using the simulator, we need a couple of over-21 volunteers.
Oh, yeah?
You got your ID?
Listen, I'd like to help you, officer, but I wouldn't be any good.
I don't get drunk too easy.
I'm from Brooklyn.
But if you're serving Pink Ladies, why don't you try him?
He's from Amherst.
I could drink you under the table with my jaw wired shut.
- Drink me under the table?
- Yeah.
If I didn't have to drive, I'd make you drink your words.
- HystericaI.
- Drink your words.
You like that?
Hey, hey, how about both of you do it, huh?
We'll arrange for your transportation home.
- Oh, yeah?
How much are the drinks?
- They're on the State of Connecticut.
Does the governor know about this?
Angela, for crying out loud, give me the key.
I've got it.
This might be Angela's surprise party.
Surprise!
No party!
Wendy, it's not nice to make fun of me.
Sorry.
IsabeI, are you gonna have a drink now or are you gonna be a drag all night?
Wendy, I am not a drag.
I'm a doctor, and I'm on call.
I have to be sober and alert in case of an emergency.
Like driving the two of you home from a Mexican restaurant.
Do you know that this is my thirty- birthday and nobody did anything.
What do you mean?
I think the waiters at Taco Loco went all out.
I thought that the candles in the refried beans was a nice touch.
Yeah, who cares if your family forgets your birthday as long as Pepe remembers?
Pepe!
Don't look down, Jeff!
Don't look down!
Jeff has had four drinks which means that his blood alcohoI content is.
09 percent.
Now, technically, he's still legaI.
But as you can see, his motor skills are calling it quits.
Nobody should drink and drive, but this guy shouldn't even drink and walk.
- Tony?
- Me?
I thought you'd never ask.
Ho.
Ho.
Ho.
After five drinks, Tony's blood alcohoI is.
12 percent legally drunk in all 50 states.
Now, at these levels, personality and behaviour changes can occur.
Inhibitions are lowered, a person becomes overconfident even cocky.
Nah, he's always like this.
Oh, yeah?
You think that's good, watch this.
You know who I think is really cute?
The new tennis pro at the club.
- Corbin?
- Yeah.
I gave him an emergency appendectomy.
You've seen him naked?
Angela, in my business, if you've seen one body, you've seen them all.
Of course, he does have a cute little tush.
You know who else is cute?
- Who?
- Tony.
Have you seen him naked?
No.
Have you?
Of course not.
- But you think he's cute, don't you?
- He's a fine person.
No, he's thoughtfuI, and he's sensitive and he's very good with Jonathan.
And he's very built too.
Yes, he has his share of muscles.
He's solid.
And responsible.
That's it.
He is the most responsible man I have ever met.
Hey, ladies!
Six of them.
- Have you been drinking?
- Like a fish.
Hey, you know what happened to me?
I went through three red lights, I went through one red barn I got stalled on some railroad tracks, and then I got run over by a train.
I told you he was tough.
IsabeI, IsabeI, now's your chance.
Make him take off his clothes and examine him.
Stop it!
I will be the nurse.
Oh, two beeps.
That's an emergency.
Come on, Wendy.
I'll take you home.
Just when it was getting good.
Oh, come on.
Angela, happy birthday.
Thank you.
- Good night, ladies.
- Good night.
- Cute.
- Stop it.
Happy birthday!
Did she say " Happy birthday"?
Oh, Angela, I forgot your birthday.
How could I have done that?
You must feeI awfuI.
Come here.
Wait a minute.
I didn't know it was your birthday because you didn't tell me.
- I didn't?
- No.
I tell you what, though, Angela.
I'm gonna go get you a present right now.
A present right now.
I'm gonna go to an after-hours present store.
I can't do that.
I can't do that because of drunk drivers.
I can't drive.
Do you know that 7 percent of all the people on the road account for 33 percent of the serious fatalities?
That's right, you know, if you drive and drink you stink.
Oh, Tony, that's very good.
- I made it up myself.
I did.
- Very good.
Tony, you don't have to buy me a present.
Nobody else did.
Yeah, well, I'm gonna do something better than a present.
I'm going into the kitchen to bake you a cake.
Oh, no, Tony, you don't have to do that.
Double fudge with walnuts?
You got it, birthday girI.
Come on.
Come on.
Okay.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Tony, this is delicious.
I told Wendy that you were a good cook.
You and Wendy were talking about me?
- We were talking about a lot of things.
- Yeah?
What'd you say about me?
Well, I just told Wendy that I was really glad that I hired you.
That's great, because I'm really glad you hired me too.
This may surprise you but when I was a kid, I never thought I'd grow up to be a housekeeper.
No?
Yeah, well anyway, this is the best job I ever had.
- Thank you, Tony.
- Yeah.
You know, I never thought I'd find somebody who Jonathan's a great kid.
And, I got- I got a new best friend in Mona.
And, I got a boss who, who's of course Who's what?
She's okay.
I just remembered what I told Wendy about you.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
I said that you were - okay.
- Ah, that's nice- Angela, cut that out.
You think that's funny?
You think that's funny?
Hey, hey, have some flour, huh?
Have some flour.
Angela, I'm- I'm sorry.
I'm- I'm- I'm really sorry.
I feeI I feeI faint.
Yeah?
- Tony?
- Yeah?
- Is that an upside-down cake?
- No.
Then I'm in big trouble.
- You're just gonna have to lie down.
- Right.
- Angela, not there, not there.
- I like it here.
- No, no, up in your room.
- I can't make it.
I'll help you.
Come on, come on, come on.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- Tony?
- Yeah?
This isn't the way Rhett Butler did it.
All right, all right, stand up.
Wait, take it easy.
Take it easy.
- That's more like it.
- Okay.
All right, all right, now.
Easy, easy.
Watch my head.
My head.
- All right, here.
Isn't that better?
- Yes, Tony.
Thank you.
- Tony?
- Yeah?
Wendy was right.
You are cute.
Thank you, Angela.
You're cute too.
Here's your nightgown.
- Tony?
- Yeah?
- Come here.
- What?
Over there?
What's the matter, Angela?
No, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait, Angela, wait.
I'm gonna hate myself in the morning.
Here.
Great day in the morning.
Angela?
Tony?
Angela, are you all right?
Yes, Mother, I'm fine.
Only please don't shout.
Angela you have a hangover.
Oh, it's the worst.
I'll never do that again.
Angela, what happened in the kitchen?
Flour.
I seem to remember doing something with flour.
- Yeah?
- Oh, I know.
I was in the kitchen baking a cake.
You baked a cake?
- That doesn't sound like you.
- No, it doesn't, does it?
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Let me think.
Oh, now I remember.
Tony came home.
He'd been drinking at the Y. You mean playing basketball?
No, I don't think so.
Anyway, he felt so bad that he missed my birthday that we went into the kitchen to bake a kiss.
- A kiss?
- What?
What are you talking about?
- You said you and Tony baked a kiss.
- No, I didn't, Mother.
I said we went into the kitchen to bake a c- Kiss!
Oh, my God, Mother.
I kissed Tony in the kitchen.
Yeah?
- Yeah, what?
- Yeah, what happened?
Well, I'm not sure.
Angela, don't you hold out on me.
I'll use force if I have to.
I'm not holding out on you.
It's just all so foggy.
What happened after you kissed Tony in the kitchen?
- Think!
Think!
Think!
- Oh, Mother, stop it.
AII I know is that my head hurts, and my feet hurt and I kissed Tony in the kitchen and- Now, Angela, I'm your mommy.
You can tell me anything.
Well, Mommy, I I remember rolling around on the bed Oh, my God, Mother.
I slept with Tony.
Better than I thought.
Good morning, Tony.
Oh, good morning, Angela.
How are you feeling?
Lousy.
As God is my witness, I will never go drinking again.
I've got the thing for you.
Something that'll make you a brand-new woman.
Tomato juice and Tabasco.
That was some night last night, huh?
Well, all evidence seems to point in that direction.
Yeah, well, maybe we should talk about it.
Well, Tony, I- I don't really know what to say.
It was all so surreaI.
Does that mean you don't want to talk about it?
- You're right.
It's no big deaI, hey.
- No big deaI?
Yeah, I mean, it was nice and all that, but, you know.
Nice?
Tony, " nice" is hardly the word I would use to describe having Well, you know.
No, I don't know.
What?
Sex, all right?
We had sex.
We did?
No, we didn't.
Angela, I'm not that kind of guy.
All we did was fooI around a little bit in the kitchen.
I beg your pardon?
You know, we baked a cake, we threw a little flour we had a little kiss and then I took you up to your room.
Did you slam me into the door?
Now you're starting to figure it out.
Yeah, that was me.
Yeah, and then I carried you upstairs and put you to bed.
Oh, so you're saying that all that happened was you kissed me?
That's it.
- Better?
- Great.
Yeah.
But, just for the record, I didn't kiss you.
You kissed me.
- I did not.
- You did too.
- I did not.
- You did too.
I did not- Well, if I did, which is still in question, I didn't mean it.
Take it from me.
You meant it.
- Well, you seemed to like it.
- Oh, yeah?
How would you remember, Ms. Lost Weekend?
You didn't like it?
- That's not what I meant.
I- - Yeah, I knew you liked it.
I remembered that.
I guess I was pretty out of it last night.
Well, let's just say we both got a little carried away.
Tony if we both got so carried away, how come you- - I left?
- Yeah.
I guess you must have had a lot to drink.
Oh, yeah, I did, but carrying your body upstairs sort of sobered me up.
Well, I guess you had a pretty bad headache.
No, that came later.
What a beauty!
- I guess I looked kind of bad.
- Oh, no, you looked really Not bad, not bad.
- I wasn't fishing or anything, Tony.
- Oh, I know that.
It's me here.
It's just that- I mean, if anything ever did happen between us I wouldn't wanna lose you as a friend.
Oh, I wouldn't want to lose you, either - as a friend.
- Yeah.
And another thing.
If- I mean, if we ever did lose each other as friends I'd want you to remember it.
And you would.
So would you.
Mom, Tony?
We're home.
Hi!
All right!
How was Brooklyn?
- It was great, Mom.
- Dad, it was just like old times.
We played stickball and everything.
I loved that game.
Jonathan told me it was your birthday so I brought you a little present.
Here.
Drink.
Enjoy.
Thank you, Mrs. Rossini.
Angela, maybe I should lock this up.
- Hide the key.
- Yeah, I got it.
Come on, Mrs. Rossini.
I wanna show you my room.
Come on.
Come on.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Are the kids back?
I thought I smelled the fish truck.
Yes, they're upstairs.
And?
How are the lovebirds this morning?
Mother, let me explain something to you.
It seems that I had a slight memory lapse, and I filled in the wrong blanks.
Now, Tony explained the whole thing.
Nothing happened.
And you believed him?
For all the girls I loved before It's just an imitation.
I was
