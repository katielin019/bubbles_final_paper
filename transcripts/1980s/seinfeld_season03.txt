{START OF EPISODE 1}
Every time somebody recommends a doctor, he's always the best.
"This guy's the best".
They can't all be the best.
There can't be this many bests.
Someone's graduating at the bottom of these classes.
Where are these doctors?
Is somewhere someone saying to their friend: "You should see my doctor.
He's the worst.
Oh, yeah.
He's the worst.
He's the absolute worst there is.
Whatever you've got, it'll be worse after you see him.
He's just a-- He's a butcher.
The man's a butcher".
Then there's always that, "Make sure you tell him that you know me".
Why?
What's the difference?
He's a doctor.
What is he--?
"Oh, you know Bob.
Oh, okay, I'll give you the real medicine.
Everybody else I'm giving Tic Tacs".
And usually for lunch, I'll have a salad.
And for dinner, I eat whatever I want.
What do you think the worst part of being blind is?
Excuse me?
You know, if you were blind what do you think the worst part of it would be?
I don't know.
I think it would be not being able to tell if there was bugs in my food.
How could you ever enjoy a meal like that?
I'd constantly be feeling around with my lips and my tongue.
Well, that's how my 5-year-old eats.
He's a very picky eater.
Hear about that kid that was kidnapped the other day in Pennsylvania?
No.
He was at a carnival with his mother.
She gets a hot dog next thing you know, she turns around, boom, he's gone.
Imagine how sick a person has to be to do something like that.
And these people are all over the place.
You never know who's crazy.
I could be one of these people.
Have you seen any good movies?
Who takes care of your boy during the day?
We have a woman.
Why?
-No, I'm just saying.
-She had references.
I'm sure she did.
I'm sure they're impeccable.
I'm talking about the ones that forge them.
You know, I think this is really helping.
I don't live near here, you know.
So she's giving me the massage and I'm just making conversation.
-I don't like to talk during a massage.
-Neither do l, but I do it for them.
-I figure they're bored.
-Yeah, I do that too.
I feel guilty about getting the pleasure.
I feel like I don't deserve it, so I talk.
It stops me from enjoying it.
There's nothing to eat in here.
-I forgot to tell you.
-I'm in the middle of a story.
-Okay, go ahead.
-Why don't you ever go shopping?
It's not like it's a really funny story.
-What happened?
-So she mentioned that she had a son.
And then for some reason I launch into the story about the kid from Pennsylvania who was abducted.
-Oh, wasn't that terrible?
-Yes, it was.
Not even an apple.
She doesn't wanna hear that.
That was stupid.
-I know it was stupid.
-Really stupid.
Hey, I just said it was stupid.
-What about this Chinese food?
-Take it.
-I can't believe you said that.
-Hey, would you stop it already.
So, what did she say?
She actually seemed to get a little paranoid.
This is terrible.
What is this, ginger?
I hate ginger.
I can't understand how anyone can eat ginger.
-I have a good masseuse.
-No, she's really good.
She's not just a masseuse.
She's a physical therapist.
There's a big difference.
She uses the ultrasound.
It's a real medical procedure.
In fact, if you get a doctor's note, it's covered by insurance.
Physical therapy is covered by insurance?
Yeah.
-You don't pay for the massage?
-Not if you have a doctor's note.
So where do you get this note?
I've never actually done it, but if I wanted to I could probably get one from Roy, the dentist.
Right.
Your friend Roy.
What's the name of this physical therapist?
I'll tell you, but don't ask her anything about her kid.
She's a little off.
And you don't have to pay?
We have 3:00 appointments.
-George and Elaine, right?
-Right.
Could you fill these out, please?
And, Elaine, you'll be seeing Julianna.
And, George, you'll be with Raymond.
Excuse me.
Did you say Raymond?
Yes.
But Raymond is a man.
That's right.
I can't get a massage from a man.
-Why not?
-What, are you crazy?
I can't have a man touching me.
Switch with me.
I don't want the man either.
What?
You're a woman.
They're supposed to be touching you.
-He'd just be touching your back.
-He'd just be touching your back too.
-No, it could get sexual.
-I know.
That's the point.
If it's gonna get sexual, it should get sexual with you.
-I wouldn't be comfortable.
-I would?
-What if something happens?
-Oh, what could happen?
What if it felt good?
-It's supposed to feel good.
-I don't want it to feel good.
-Then why get the massage?
-Exactly.
George.
-Yes.
-I'm Raymond.
Hello.
Are you ready?
And then Julianna asked me if I wanted to join her here in the office.
Really?
Used to be a flight attendant.
Oh, boy.
Why don't you open those pants.
It's gonna be a lot easier that way.
-So, what do you do?
-What?
I said, what do you do?
I don't know.
-You don't know what you do?
-No.
Oh, come on.
-You're very tense.
-Coffee.
Too much coffee.
Take off those pants.
I'll work the hamstring.
Oh, the hamstring's fine.
-But you wrote that it was tender.
-I wrote.
I wrote.
I'll check it out.
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.
Take them off.
How did you hurt this?
I don't know.
-You don't know?
-No.
-But you just told me.
-Korea.
-You hurt it in Korea?
-What?
-The hamstring.
-Korea.
How?
Hamstring.
How did you hurt the hamstring?
Hotel.
How'd it go?
George?
No appointments at all?
Because my neck is still tight.
What about Thursday?
And Friday?
Oh, boy.
Okay.
Thanks anyway.
What's with you?
A. Yes.
A. A man gave me.
Yes.
A man gave you.
A man gave me a massage.
-So?
-So he had his hands and.
He was.
-He was what?
-He-- He was touching and rubbing.
That's a massage.
-Then I took my pants off.
-You took your pants off?
For my hamstring.
He got about two inches from -there.
-Really?
I think it moved.
-lt moved?
-lt may have moved.
I don't know.
-I'm sure it didn't move.
-lt moved!
It was imperceptible, but I felt it.
Maybe it just wanted to change positions.
You know -shift to the other side.
-No, no.
It wasn't a shift.
I've shifted.
This was a move.
-Okay.
So what if it moved?
-That's the sign, the test.
If a-- If a man makes it move.
That's not the test.
Contact is the test.
If it moves as a result of contact.
Do you think it's contact?
It has to be touched?
That's what a gym teacher once told me.
-Hey.
-Hey.
I just saw Joe DiMaggio in Dinky Doughnuts.
You know, I looked in there and there he was having coffee and a doughnut.
Joe DiMaggio?
-ln Dinky Doughnuts?
-Yes.
-Joe DiMaggio.
-No.
I'm sorry.
If Joe DiMaggio wants a doughnut, he goes to a fancy restaurant.
He's not sitting in Dinky Doughnuts.
Well, maybe he likes Dinky Doughnuts.
I don't like to sit next to men on airplanes because our knees might touch.
I can't see Joe DiMaggio sitting at the counter at little, tiny, filthy, smelly Dinky Doughnuts.
Why can't he have a doughnut like everybody else?
He can have a doughnut, but not a Dinky.
I don't even like to use urinals.
Always been a stall man.
Look, I'm telling-- I'm telling you, that was Joe DiMaggio.
The guy slept with Marilyn Monroe.
He's in Dinky Doughnuts.
What about this doctor's note?
-Let's go see Roy.
-I never said I'd do that.
What are you talking about?
That's 75 bucks.
I'm not working.
I can't afford that.
I don't know how I feel about it.
Oh, what are you, like a Quaker now?
All right, all right.
A stall man, huh?
So we were wondering if it was possible for you to write us a note.
And if you can't, believe me, it's fine.
-He didn't say he can't.
-lf you feel funny about it at all.
-He doesn't feel funny.
-lf he does.
-Do you feel funny?
-Forget it.
-He didn't say anything.
-He feels funny.
-You don't have to do this.
-He knows that!
Should we go?
Is this a breach of our friendship?
Oh, can you be any more dramatic?
Don't be ridiculous.
Holyfield.
He's a good friend of one of my patients.
He's got a hell of a body, doesn't he?
How would I know?
Do you like him?
What do you mean, like him?
-Do you like him?
-Well, I mean, he's a good fighter and a nice guy, but I don't like him.
-How come you don't like him?
-Why should l?
-What is the matter with you?
-Nothing.
Why?
You think something's wrong?
Am I different?
-So you want the notes?
-You don't have to, really.
No, no.
It's okay.
We should probably get one for Elaine too, right, George?
George?
George.
What about the week after?
No appointments at all?
What?
Well, can l--?
Can I at least just talk to her so I can apologize?
Forget it.
I can't believe this.
I make one innocent comment about some lunatic in Pennsylvania, and I'm cut off.
This woman is insane.
What's with you?
What?
You were too close to me.
I was all scrunched in there.
Hey, you scrunched me.
I sat down here first.
Hey.
I saw DiMaggio in the doughnut shop again.
-Yeah.
-Joe DiMaggio?
Joe DiMaggio.
This time I went in and I sat down across from him and I really watched him.
I studied his every move.
For example, he dunks.
-Joe DiMaggio dunks his doughnuts?
-That's right.
See, now I know it's not him.
Joe DiMaggio could not be a dunker.
Oh, he's a dunker.
-Why couldn't he be a dunker?
-Nothing diverts his attention.
Like, I'm sitting in there, you know and I start banging on the table so that he'll look up.
Like I'm sitting there, and l-- He wouldn't move.
So then I started doing these yelping noises, like: No reaction, because the guy is so focused, you see.
He can just block out anything that's going on around him.
See, that's how he played baseball.
He dunks like he hits.
-So then what?
-Well then the waitress, she comes up and she tells me to shut up or they're gonna throw me out.
Why didn't you just call out his name?
What happened to you?
These kids called me a Mary.
A what?
I was jumping over a puddle.
For some reason, I went like this: And they called me a Mary.
So I chased them and I tripped and I fell.
Yeah, you know kids.
They can be very perceptive.
Hey, George.
What is this?
What is that?
No, really.
What is that?
Hello.
Oh, hi, Roy.
What?
Oh, my God.
How did this happen?
What can I do?
I am so sorry.
Okay.
Bye.
That was Roy.
He's under investigation for insurance fraud.
-I told you.
-Told me what?
-I told you we shouldn't do it.
-I didn't say anything.
He's got a house, a family.
They could take away his license.
Three notes.
How stupid was that?
We never should've got three notes.
-Three notes?
-Yeah.
You, me and George.
-You got me a note?
-Yeah.
-But I got my own note.
-You what?
-I got a note from my gynecologist.
-Why'd you do that?
-I didn't know you'd get me a note.
-Of course I'd get you a note.
-You didn't say anything.
-Neither did you.
That's how he got caught.
We sent in four notes from two doctors.
How could you do that to your friend?
He's got a wife, kids and a lot of other stuff.
Oh, yeah.
-Hi, Pam.
-Hello.
Hello.
I just thought maybe I could talk to Roy if-- Pam, did the x-ray from Mrs. Sloane--?
-Hi.
-Hi, Roy.
-How you doing?
-Come on back.
I have a patient, but she's under.
-I don't even know what to say.
-Me neither.
-I knew this would happen.
-Me too.
I mean, the whole thing, it's just.
-Tragic.
-Well, it's not tragic.
-No?
-No.
It's.
-Unsettling?
-Okay.
-I mean, what if they--?
-I hope you're both happy.
I'm not happy.
Me, neither.
I've never been happy.
I mean, I'm happy sometimes, but not now.
In college, maybe.
-Those were fun times.
-Yeah, college was fun.
You know the whole practice is in jeopardy.
You know that.
-Don't mind her.
-Oh, please.
I love her.
I've just met her, but I'm very impressed.
I've never had a problem with these notes before.
What's gonna happen now?
Nothing, as long as we get the physical therapist to go along with our story.
What?
The physical therapist?
Why?
She has to say the complaint was related to a dental problem.
How you doing?
Hi.
Look, I know I don't have an appointment but it's really important that I talk with Julianna.
I'm sorry.
She's not in.
I know she's mad at me, but I really have to speak with her.
I told you she's not here.
Look, you have to leave.
Wait a second.
Don't you--?
Hi.
Look, I don't know what you think-- -Please.
-But, you see.
Let me talk to you for a second.
What I did is inadvertently-- I treated you, so please just get out of the office.
Can't you listen to me?
Run, Billy!
Run to the office and close the door.
Call the police.
The police.
What is the--?
Hi, George.
Hello.
Raymond?
Well, I mean, it's only a six-month probation.
It's a slap on the wrist.
I still don't see any dinner invitations forthcoming.
Men have been popping into my sexual fantasies.
All of a sudden, I'll be in the middle.
Of what?
And a guy will appear from out of nowhere.
I said, "Get out of here.
What do you want?
You don't belong here".
-What do they do?
-They talk back.
They go, "Hey, George, how's it going"?
I said, "Get the hell out of here".
Hey, it's the K-Man.
Maybe it's time you got a different hobby.
Oh, man.
Just came from Roy's.
I threw up from the gas.
-Did he say anything?
-No, no.
He's fine.
Oh, my God.
It's.
-What?
-Joe DiMaggio.
Having a cup of coffee.
-And he's dunking.
-Yeah.
Look at him.
The Yankee Clipper.
Here.
You see?
Now, that is a handsome man.
Oh, please.
Wait.
Hold on a minute.
Wait.
See?
I told you.
What causes homophobia?
What is it that makes a heterosexual man worry?
I think it's because men know that deep down we have weak sales resistance.
We're constantly buying shoes that hurt us, pants that don't fit right.
Men think, "Obviously, I can be talked into anything.
What if I accidentally wander into some sort of homosexual store thinking it's a shoe store, and the salesman goes: 'Just hold this guy's hand, walk around the store.
See how you feel.
No obligation, no pressure, just try it.
Would you like to see him in a sandal"?

{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Good evening.
Welcome to the show.
The extra buttons.
Yeah.
What kind of a sicko, really, would save these have them in a huge file?
Drawers that wide.
You know, you just.
"Where the hell is that but--" I mean, is it that hard to get black, round buttons that they make it into a whole thing?
Like this is such a great jacket.
These buttons are so unique, so one-of-a-kind.
You'll never find them.
We'll save you the trouble of knocking your brains out.
We know they're going to fall off too.
That's the other point that they're trying to make here.
Everyone in my family's creative.
And even though I'm working as an accountant right now I'd really like to eventually work exclusively on my papier-mâché hats.
I don't understand.
Papier-mâché hats?
What if it rains?
They're art.
You hang them on the wall.
Art.
It's my creative outlet, one of my passions.
Any money in it?
"Who so belongs only to his age reverences only its popinjays and mumbo jumbos".
Of course.
Right.
-Thomas Carlyle, 1864.
-Tommy C. These are the receipts from '85.
-And I'm gonna do '86.
-I'm sorry.
I thought it was a legitimate charity.
I didn't know you'd get audited.
I don't blame you.
I blame myself.
-No, blame me.
-Okay, I blame you.
-No, no, don't blame me.
-What was I supposed to do?
I was on my first date with Elaine.
You come barging in here, asking me to contribute money to a volcano relief fund for Krakatoa.
It was supposed to erupt.
I find the whole thing embarrassing.
Well, you know what my feelings are about this.
I don't even pay taxes.
Yeah.
That's easy when you have no income.
-Hi.
-Hi.
Kramer, do me a favour, will you?
If you insist on making pasta in my apartment please don't put the tomato sauce on the pasta while it's in the strainer.
All the little squares have hardened red sauce in them.
What's so funny?
Oh, I don't know.
Kramer dating your roommate, it's funny.
It's a riot, Alice.
When do you put the sauce on?
Any other time.
No, no, no.
I like to strain the sauce.
And I could really live without the tribal music and the make-out sessions in the living room.
Yeah, Tina likes the couch.
-What are you doing?
What is all this?
-Oh, he's helping me sort my receipts.
I'm being audited.
You're being audited?
What for?
Oh, I contributed money to a charity that turned out to be fraudulent.
-It's really very boring.
-When was this?
A long, long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.
I remember you donated to some volcano thing on our first date.
Volcano?
Really?
Oh, wait a minute.
Don't tell me that that was-- Something to drink?
What, did you think that would impress me?
You've got me all wrong.
I was thinking only of the poor Krakatoan.
Like you'd make this donation for 50 bucks and I'd start tearing my clothes off?
Those brave Krakatoans east of Java who sacrificed so much, for so long.
Now you're being audited because of it.
-See, that's karma.
-No, that's Kramer.
-So, what are you gonna do?
-It's all taken care of.
How is that?
An old friend of mine, whom you may have met George Costanza, has recently become intimate with a female accountant who was formerly a highly placed official with a little outfit known as the lRS.
And as we speak, at this very moment he is handing over to her all of my pertinent tax information and she has assured us that the matter is well within her field of expertise.
Why is she doing this?
I don't know.
It must be love.
I don't think we should see each other anymore.
You're great but I'm riddled with personal problems.
-What's wrong?
What did I do?
-Nothing.
It's not you.
It's me.
I have a fear of commitment.
-I don't know how to love.
-You hate my earrings, don't you?
-No, no.
-And you didn't comment on the chopsticks.
I love the chopsticks.
I personally prefer a fork, but they look very nice.
You're not telling me the truth.
I must have done something.
-I have a fear of intimacy.
I-- -Don't give me clichés.
I have a right to know.
What did I do?
Nothing.
It's not you.
I want the truth!
The truth?
You want the truth?
!
It is your earrings!
It is your chopsticks.
But it's so much more.
You're pretentious.
You call everyone by their full name.
You called my doorman Sammy, "Samuel".
But you didn't even say Samuel.
You went "Samuel".
Papier-mâché?
What is papier-mâché?
Keep going.
I think I made my point.
I'm sorry if I was a little harsh.
No.
I asked for the truth.
Thank you for being so honest.
Can l?
-Can I walk you back to work?
-I really prefer to go alone.
How much do I owe?
Oh, please.
Four dollars is fine.
If this audit had happened to me and I didn't have this woman to help me I would've killed this man.
I would've strangled him with my bare hands.
-I don't blame you.
-Ever been through an audit?
-No.
-It's hell.
It's the financial equivalent of a complete rectal examination.
I would've killed this man.
Torn him limb from limb.
Ripped the flesh right off his bones.
-Yeah?
-It's George.
Come on up.
There he is, the man himself George Louis Costanza.
Here I am, about to go to the electric chair and my oldest friend is dating the governor.
My whole life has been a complete waste of time.
And there's so much more to go.
Now I know what I'm supposed to do.
It is so simple.
Tell the truth.
That's all.
Just tell the truth.
-You give her my tax papers?
-What?
My papers?
What?
Oh, the papers.
-You didn't give her the papers?
-No, I did.
So?
I broke up with her.
-You what?
-I broke up with her.
I'm being audited -and you broke up with her?
-It's okay.
It's fine.
-She'll do it.
I'm sure she'll still do it.
-Why?
Why will she still do it?
She hates you now.
People don't do you favours after you dump them.
No, no.
We left on good terms.
How is that possible?
Because l-- I told her the truth.
-Oh, my God.
-Okay.
-It's unheard of.
-She asked me to.
So you lie.
-What did you tell her?
-I told her that she was pretentious.
Pretentious?
The woman has my tax papers.
You told her she's pretentious?
The lRS they're like the Mafia.
They take anything they want.
How would you like it if someone told you the truth?
-What?
What could they say?
-There are plenty of things to say.
Like what?
I'm bald?
What is it specifically?
Is there an odour I'm not aware of?
-George, please.
-Give me one.
-You sure?
-Yes.
Okay.
You're extremely careful with money.
I'm what?
-Forget it.
-I'm cheap?
You think I'm cheap?
!
How could you say that to me?
I can't believe this!
-How could you say that to me?
-You asked me to.
-You should've lied.
-So should you!
Okay, wait a second.
What happened to my papers?
-I'm not really working right now.
-I know.
When I was working, I spent, baby!
Yeah, I know.
Champagne, limos, cigars.
What happened to the papers?
She put them in her pocketbook.
I guess she took them.
-A pocketbook or a handbag?
-ls that relevant?
She took them.
Call her office.
Give me the phone.
Yeah, hi, I'd like to speak to Patrice.
What?
Oh, really.
Oh, okay.
Thank you.
What?
What?
She never came back from lunch.
This is no good.
This is no good.
Call her house.
Hi.
Are you okay?
No, no.
No-- She hung up.
Not good.
All right, look, there's nothing to be worried about.
She's just a little annoyed right now.
Tomorrow, I'll personally go over there.
I'll apologize.
I'll get the papers.
Don't worry.
Don't worry.
Not good.
Yeah, it's a windshield.
I can see that.
What's it for?
I found it on the road.
-Yeah?
-I just finished working out.
-Are you busy?
-No.
Come on up.
Can you believe somebody threw this out?
I'm gonna make a coffee table out of this and surprise Tina.
Well, wouldn't it be invisible?
I mean, what, are you gonna just sense it's in front of the couch?
Well.
Hello.
Hello.
What's with you two?
-You haven't told him?
-Told me what?
Go ahead, tell him.
I saw her naked.
He saw me naked.
Kramer saw me naked.
Well, it was an accident.
Who walks into a woman's bedroom without knocking?
I wanna know.
I thought it was a closet.
Completely naked?
Completely naked.
Jerry, how can I go on?
All right, if it's gonna make you feel any better, you can see me naked.
No, thank you.
-No, I want you to see me naked.
-No, no, no.
-I wanna show you.
-No!
Jerry!
Hold it.
Just a second.
Let's not lose our heads here.
Kramer, you know you're always welcome in my home but as far as Mr. Johnson is concerned that's another story.
-What is this?
-It's a windshield.
It's going to be your new coffee table.
I'm gonna kill myself on that thing.
You can't even see it.
You'll sense it.
Well?
What happened?
Was she there?
No.
No, she wasn't.
-You didn't get my papers?
-No, I didn't.
Well, where is she?
A mental institution.
Why is it so difficult, uncomfortable to be naked?
It's because we have clothes on you can always make those little adjustments, which people love to do.
You feel like you're getting it together.
"Yeah, I look pretty good.
Feeling good, looking good".
But when you're naked, it's like-- It's so final.
You're just, "Well that's it.
There's nothing else I can do".
That's why I like to wear a belt when I'm naked.
Because I feel it gives me something.
Some, you know, "I'm naked, but, you know".
I'd like to get pockets to hang off of the belt.
That would be-- Wouldn't that be the ultimate thing?
To be naked and still be able to do this.
I think that would really help a lot.
A mental institution?
You know what they do in there?
Did you see Cuckoo's Nest?
They put those electrodes in your head.
It's not really a mental institution.
It's more like a depression clinic.
She went out to Woodhaven and checked herself in.
I'm sick over this.
-Who told you this?
-Her roommate.
I've driven women to lesbianism before but never to a mental institution.
My friend Bob Sacamano had shock treatments.
But his synapses were so large, had no effect.
You know, I hate to raise a crass financial concern but was there any information as to the whereabouts of my papers?
She put them in her pocketbook.
She probably took them out there with her.
-So, what now?
-I don't know.
Can we go out there?
-Where?
-Woodhaven.
We could.
I'm very nervous about this.
I've never spoken to a mental patient before.
My cousin Douglas was in a place like this one time.
Came over to my house for dinner, there was no soda and he went berserk.
He was screaming, "Where's the Pepsi?
Where's the Pepsi"?
I should be in a place like this.
I envy this woman.
Get to wear slippers all day.
Friends visit, they pity you.
Pity's very underrated.
I like it.
It's good.
Plus, they give you those word- association tests.
I love those.
They're great.
There's no wrong answer.
-Potato.
-Tuberculosis.
-Blanket.
-Leroy.
-Grass.
-Tuberculosis.
Oh, boy.
Here she comes.
Oh, my God.
Oh, Kram.
Kramer!
Kramer, could you please put something on?
Well.
Oh, boy.
Listen, you want some leftovers?
I made some African food.
There's yambalas and sambusa.
Sweetie.
-Are you coming back to bed?
-Yeah, yeah.
I'll be right there, babe.
Hi, Elaine.
What did you think of the coffee table?
It's invisible.
So is everything cool or what?
Yeah, you seem a little bit dysfunctional.
-Well.
-Come on, Elaine just tell us the truth.
The truth?
You want the truth?
Who are you?
This is my friend Jerry.
Why are you talking like that?
And what do you want?
Want?
What could I possibly want?
I just came because I heard so many nice things about you from George.
George thinks I'm pretentious.
Pretentious.
Who isn't pretentious?
I mean if everyone that was pretentious was in a mental institution-- Obviously, this isn't a mental institution.
You're trying to take it back because you're feeling guilty I'm in here.
-No, that's not it at all.
-Don't lie, George!
I'm not a liar.
We're cool.
Everything's cool.
-No problem.
We're good.
-Just chatting.
Very friendly.
Alrighty.
No reason for us to raise our voices.
I know what you said.
You can't change that.
What I said.
I say stupid things all the time.
I can't go two minutes without saying something dumb.
It's one stupid thing after another.
So let me ask you, when you come to one of these places do you bring your pocketbook?
You should be the one criticizing me.
I'm lucky to even know someone like you.
-Do you mean that?
-Of course.
-I'm incapable of guile.
-He's never guiled.
You know, some women keep a lot of important papers in their pocketbooks.
Like, for example someone else's personal financial papers.
Papers.
Oh, Jerry.
You're the Jerome with the tax problem.
You know, after that date with George I got so cuckoo, I threw out all your papers.
So I'd love to help you, but I'll just need the copies.
There are no copies.
So are you saying you want to continue seeing me?
Who makes copies?
The truth is I think you make a very nice couple.
Oh, Kramer.
-Here, Kramer?
-No, no.
Let's go to the couch.
Yes, I'm trying to get a copy of a receipt for a computer that I bought there.
It was 1987.
I remember I talked to a guy, had, like, a maroon sport jacket and he might have had a toupee.
Oh, it was a weave?
Okay, well, then I'll come by.
Okay, bye.
Anybody want to take a walk down to 48th Street?
I think I may have tracked down another receipt.
I can't.
I got to go visit Tina in the hospital.
-George?
-I'm going to a poetry reading with Patrice.
First-time poets.
It's in a burnt-out building down by the docks.
It's supposed to be good.
Are you going to the hospital now?
-Yeah, I suppose I am.
-All right.
Great, great.
We'll share a cab.
You going by 48th.
You can give me a ride.
I'm getting in on that.
-Yeah.
-You know you're chipping in.
You're going that way anyway!
Come on.
I was audited last year.
I have been through an audit.
At first, I thought, "Well, lRS kind of sounds like Toys 'R' Us.
Maybe it won't be so bad.
Maybe they have a sense of fun about it".
You know?
But it's bad.
It's an ordeal.
And they don't do anything to keep your spirits up through the ordeal.
I think they should take all your receipts and put them in one of those big, Lucite sweepstake drums and just kind of crank it around there.
Give you a feeling like you might win something.
You know what I mean?
Then they can pull them out and go: "Oh, I'm sorry.
That's another illegal deduction but we do have some lovely parting gifts for you.
Jail".

{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
I have never seen an old person in a new bathing suit in my life.
I don't know where they get their bathing suits.
But my father has bathing suits from other centuries.
My parents live in Florida.
And if you go down there and you forget your bathing suit then they want you to wear one of theirs.
You know how that gets?
"You need trunks, son?
I got trunks for you.
You can wear my trunks".
Fathers don't wear bathing suits, they wear trunks.
It's kind of the same thing a tree would wear if it went swimming.
So I get in the water in this thing, and it's, like, floating around me somewhere.
You ever put on a bathing suit that you don't know exactly where you are inside the bathing suit?
You bump into somebody, "No, I'm parasailing.
I'm waiting for the boat to come back".
It was supposed to be here at 7:30.
-Call the airlines again.
-What happened to the Scotch tape?
Who takes the Scotch tape?
Nobody returns anything around here.
Oh, I think that's them.
Know what I'll do next time?
I'll hide it so nobody can find it.
-Hi!
Welcome!
-Hi!
-Welcome.
-How are you?
-Welcome to Florida!
-Hi, Mr. Seinfeld.
Hey, there's the old man.
So, what took you so long?
We waited 35 minutes in the rent-a-car place.
I don't know why.
We would have picked you up.
-What's the difference?
-You could use our car.
I don't want to use your car.
-What's wrong with our car?
-Nothing.
It's fine.
-What if you want to use it?
-We don't.
-What?
We use it.
-lf you were using it, we wouldn't.
So, what, you'd hitch?
-How much is a rent-a-car?
-I don't know, 25 bucks a day.
-What?
Oh, you're crazy.
-Plus the insurance.
Oh, I didn't get the insurance.
How could you not get the insurance?
We'll pay for the car.
-You're not paying for it.
-Morty.
God, it's so hot in here.
Why don't you put on the air conditioning?
You don't need the air conditioner.
Do you have your speech all ready?
Do I have to make a speech?
Of course.
They're giving a testimonial for your father.
-You could do your comic routines.
-Oh, yeah.
That'll go over real well with that crowd.
You have a lake.
-The lake isn't real.
-The lake is real.
Are you kidding?
They built the lake.
But it's real, it's water.
-Where are you going with those?
-I'll put Elaine's stuff in here.
Don't sleep in there.
Sleep in the bedroom.
I can't take your bedroom.
-I'm up at 6:00 in the morning.
-I can't kick you out of your bed.
We don't even sleep.
-Ma.
-It's a sofa bed.
-You'll be uncomfortable.
-What about you?
Why should I be comfortable?
-What about him?
-Don't worry.
He's comfortable.
I'll sleep standing up.
I'll be fine.
-Will you stop?
-Yeah, I'll just stay in here.
Jerry.
Jerry, you don't have to stay on the couch on my account.
-You two can stay in there together.
-That's not a good idea.
-I thought that you-- -Not now.
She's right inside.
What happened?
I don't know.
We decided we don't really work as a couple.
-What does that mean?
-Well-- Why are you whispering?
-Nothing, nothing.
-Elaine.
-What about her?
-Would you please be--?
You know, look at the sun-dried tomatoes.
Where were they five years ago?
It just goes to show you, you never know what-- What, you know, could happen to a vegetable.
It could just take right off at any time.
We've tried all kinds of arrangements but we can't seem to be friends when we sleep together.
Why do you need more friends?
You've got plenty of friends.
-He's an idealist.
-What are you looking for?
-I'm looking.
I like looking.
-He likes looking.
-So look.
-But how long can you look?
I'm going for the record.
Your father wouldn't say so, but he's really glad you came.
-Oh, come on.
-This is a big thing for him.
Outgoing president of the condo association.
So they arrived safely.
-Remember Jack and Doris?
-Nice to see you.
-This is Elaine.
-Hi.
-Nice to meet you.
Hello.
-Hello.
-Pleased to meet you.
-Hey, Jerry you came all the way down here for this?
And scuba diving.
Scuba diving?
Who's going scuba diving?
We're going.
We'll be back in time.
What do you have to go scuba diving for?
-For fun.
-For fun?
Jack, have some sponge cake.
No.
Thanks, no.
Jack is emceeing tomorrow.
-He's in charge of the whole thing.
-So, Jerry, your mother tells me you're gonna do one of your little comedy skits tomorrow.
-I don't think so.
-No?
Listen, Morty, you want to settle up for last night?
All right.
I owe you $19.45.
What did you have?
You had the minute steak.
-Yeah.
-Did you have a Coke or what?
I did not have a Coke.
Somebody had a Coke.
-I had a Coke.
-Oh, and I had the scampi.
So, that's $17.10, and the tax and the tip.
All right, make it 20 bucks.
It's $19.45, Morty.
$19.45?
See, you know your father.
You got to get it right to the penny.
But that's why he was such a good president.
Hey, what kind of pen is that?
-This pen?
-Yeah.
Oh, this is an astronaut pen.
It writes upside down.
They use this in space.
Oh, that's the astronaut pen.
I heard about that.
Where did you get it?
-lt was a gift.
-Because a lot of times I write in bed and I have to turn and lean on my elbow to make the pen work.
-Take the pen.
-Oh, no.
-Go ahead.
- I couldn't.
-Take it.
-I can't take it.
-Do me a personal favour.
-No, I'm not comfortable.
-I cannot take it.
-Take the pen.
-Are you sure?
-I'm positive.
Take the pen.
Okay, thank you very much.
Thank you.
Gee, boy.
-Jack, what are you doing?
-Stop it.
Jack, we should go.
It was nice meeting you.
-Nice to meet you.
-Thanks again.
Come on!
She's adorable.
What did you take his pen for?
-He gave it to me.
-But you didn't have to take it.
She's gotta make a big deal out of everything.
-He offered it to me.
-Because you made such a big fuss.
Well, I liked it.
Should l have said I didn't like it?
You shouldn't have said anything.
What did you expect?
He could have said, "Thank you," and put it back in his pocket.
-He loves that pen.
-Come on.
He talks about it all the time.
He goes on and on about how it writes upside down, how astronauts use it.
He never should have offered it.
-He didn't think you'd accept.
-Well, he was wrong.
I know his wife.
She has some mouth on her.
She'll tell everyone in the condo now that you made him give you the pen.
They're talking about it right now.
-So you want me to return it?
-Yes.
He's not gonna return that pen.
That's ridiculous.
I don't even want the pen now.
Jack can afford to give away a pen with all his money, believe me.
He gives me a check for $19.45.
He didn't have a Coke.
Here, let me see it.
-Hey, it writes upside down.
-Yeah.
Come in.
You okay in here?
Why is it so hot in here?
How can they sleep like this?
It's only for three days.
Today's over.
Then we have tomorrow.
We leave on Sunday.
It's one day, really.
What is with this bar?
It's right in my back.
It's killing me.
You wanna switch?
I'm on a love seat.
I got my feet up in the air like I'm in a space capsule.
I am never gonna fall asleep.
Oh, no, don't say that.
You'll jinx me.
How can they not put the air conditioning on?
They're nuts with temperature.
This bar is right in my back.
It's making a dent.
How about that guy writing a check for $19.45?
I'm sweating here.
I'm in bed, sweating.
It's one day.
Half a day, really.
I mean, you subtract showers and meals, it's like 20 minutes.
It'll go by like that.
Stay on 95 South to Biscayne Boulevard.
Then you make a left turn.
Put your blinker on immediately, there's an abutment there.
Then you're gonna merge over very quickly, but stay on Biscayne.
Don't get off Biscayne, you understand me?
Stay on Biscayne.
You're going underwater?
Yes, generally, that's where scuba diving is done.
What do you have to go for?
What's down there that's so special?
What's so special up here?
What's the matter?
-My back.
-What happened?
That-- That bed.
The bar was right in my back.
I told you to let us sleep in there.
Then you would be hunched over.
I don't even know if I can go scuba diving.
-You can't go?
-So stay home.
-You can go.
-Without you?
That's the reason you came down.
-Don't go.
-You sure?
Maybe you should see a doctor.
-We'll stay in a hotel tonight.
-No, we'll stay in there.
Why don't you get a new sofa?
Nobody uses it.
I'm buying you a new sofa.
Jerry, don't talk crazy.
Mrs. Seinfeld, please I am begging you: Put the air conditioner on.
You're hot?
I've lost six pounds.
I don't even know how to work it.
I keep telling her it's like an oven in here.
Is everybody up?
Hi, how are you?
Hello, Jerry.
Evelyn, this is Elaine.
Hi, Evelyn.
Jerry, you got thin.
-Too thin?
-Oh, stop worrying so much about how you look.
So where's the new pen?
-What?
-The pen.
The one Jack Klompus gave you.
-How did you know that?
-Blanche told me.
-Blanche?
-That's some good pen.
-Writes upside down.
-Yeah.
-The astronauts use them.
-What did Blanche say?
I don't know, she said Jerry wanted the pen.
I never really wanted the pen.
-He gave him the pen.
-Morty.
-Why?
You don't like the pen?
-No, no, l-- Because if you don't, give it back to him.
-ls that what she said?
-Who?
-Blanche.
-What are you talking about?
Hello?
Oh, hello, Gussy.
What?
Jerry wouldn't do that.
Jack gave it to him.
All he said was he liked it.
I mean, nobody put a gun to his head.
You're giving him back that pen.
Somebody, please.
The air conditioner.
Oh, my God, I forgot all about it.
All I said was, "l like the pen".
How the hell do you work this thing?
Maybe you shouldn't go tonight.
Oh, no, no, I wanna go.
But your back hurts.
Maybe a couple of muscle relaxers would help.
Oh, okay.
You can turn down the air conditioning if you want.
No, I'm fine.
-You're not too cold?
-No.
-Don't be alarmed.
-Oh, my God.
-What the hell happened to you?
-I'm okay.
-My capillaries burst.
-Your capillaries?
-Do you know what you look like?
-How you doing?
Having a good time.
Is it my imagination or is it freezing in here?
What happened to your eyes?
-Well, I started to go under-- -With the instructor?
Yeah, I got about 10 feet down and felt this tremendous pressure on my mask Iike my eyeballs were being sucked out of their sockets.
I told you.
Excuse me.
Doris would like to borrow your red pocketbook to go with her shoes.
The shoes have to match the pocketbook.
What's she doing, yoga?
-My back hurts.
-Morty, better hurry up.
-Get ready.
-We got plenty of time.
-What happened?
-I got in a fistfight with one of the ladies at the pool.
It's from scuba diving.
What's there to see underwater?
Listen, Mr. Klompus it was a nice gesture to give me the pen, but I don't really need it.
-You what?
-It's a terrific pen but I think you should keep it.
-Well, I mean-- -Take it.
All right.
You know, Jack, you got a hell of a nerve taking that kid's pen.
-Whose pen?
-His pen.
This happens to be my pen.
-You didn't give it to him?
-What are you talking about?
He practically begged me for it.
Where do you come off with this crap?
Listen, do you think I take everything everybody offers me?
You offered me sponge cake yesterday.
-Did I take it?
-You didn't want it.
Of course I wanted it!
I love sponge cake.
Who said you couldn't have it?
I mean what the hell do I care whether you have sponge cake?
Because I saw the look on your face last week when I took the Scotch tape.
So you got the Scotch tape.
-I've been looking all over for it.
-I'll give it back.
-I don't want it.
-I don't want it!
You know, Jack, do me a favour, will you?
Take the pen and the Scotch tape and get the hell out of here.
Listen, do you think I give a damn?
Nerve of that guy, taking back that pen.
Well, that's it for them.
What is going on in this community?
Are you people aware of what's happening?
What is driving you to this behaviour?
Is it the humidity?
Is it the Muzak?
Is it the white shoes?
I have no use for either one of them.
I don't want them there tonight.
Isn't he supposed to emcee?
Yeah, he's supposed to be the emcee.
Well, this should be a very interesting evening.
What about those muscle relaxers?
Say "astronaut".
Say what?
Say what?
You took too many of those pills.
-Astronaut?
-Say it.
-Astronaut!
-Astro.
Good.
Okay.
Last year, I took him to the hospital every day.
Did he ever say thank you?
Oh, God.
Uncle Leo.
Hello!
-Morty, are you nervous?
-What nervous?
What's with the sunglasses?
Who are you, Van Johnson?
I got a black eye.
Hello.
Oh, Elaine this is my Aunt Stella.
Stella!
Stella!
Her back hurts.
We saw you on The Tonight Show last week.
I thought Johnny was very rude to you.
-He didn't even let you talk.
-No, no.
You need some new material.
I've heard you do that dog routine three times already.
Stella!
Stella!
You should get your cousin Jeffrey to write some material for you.
What?
Jeffrey works for the Parks Department.
You should read the letters he's written.
He's funnier than the whole bunch of you.
Oh, here's Jack.
We should sit down.
This better be good.
I'm missing Golden Girls for this.
I hate her like poison.
Hey, Jack, let's get started.
Ladies and gentlemen, as you know every year, phase two of the Pines of Mar Gables honours the previous year's president.
And this year, we are honouring Morty Seinfeld.
Morty!
A man who slept more hours on the job than Ronald Reagan.
Slept on the job?
Being president of the condo is not easy.
It requires hard work, dedication, and commitment.
And unfortunately, he possesses none of these qualities.
I wonder what he ever did.
He's joking.
His administration did excel in one department: The hiring of incompetents.
That's what you say.
But we do owe him a debt of gratitude because by not fixing the crack in the sidewalk it put Mrs. Ziven out of commission for a few weeks.
Tell them about when you took my son's pen back.
Tell them about that.
Dad.
He gave my son a pen, and then he takes it back.
-Tell them that!
-I took it back?
-He gave it to me!
-That's enough.
Sit down.
-I'm not finished!
-Give me that microphone.
Give it!
-Morty, give me that.
-Give him the pen.
You broke my dental plate.
Doris!
He broke my dental plate.
You son of a bitch.
I'll sue you.
Jerry, do your act.
I can't.
Nobody's even listening.
Well, they're all gonna leave.
-I got witnesses here.
-Even your wife is on my side.
How you folks doing tonight?
Hey, have you ever noticed how they give you the peanuts on the planes?
-Not my Harry!
He flies first class!
-Who thought the thing everybody wants on a plane is a peanut?
-I'd rather have a bottle of Scotch!
-Do the dog routine.
All I said was, "l like the pen"!
Stella!
You could aggravate it.
I wouldn't go anywhere for at least five days.
Five days?
You want me to stay here for five more days?
There must be some mistake.
I'm afraid not.
Five days.
Here.
So we have you for five more days.
There's no point in me staying.
You're just gonna be-- Excuse me?
Nothing.
-Good morning.
-Hi, Evelyn.
Has Morty decided on a lawyer yet?
-I don't think so.
-Because my nephew Larry could do it.
He's a brilliant lawyer.
He says Jack has no case.
I'll ask him when he gets up.
Oh, and I spoke to Arnold and he says that according to the bylaws of the condo constitution they need six votes to throw you out for unruly behaviour.
Not five.
Dr. Chernov is the one you'll have to suck up to.
Oh, my back.
Oh, my back.
That bar.
Who the hell could sleep on that thing?
-I was very comfortable.
-Morty Arnold says they need six votes to throw you out.
It's in the constitution.
-Who are you?
-I'm a chiropractor.
What, are you kidding me?
Five more days?
Well, today's almost over, and weekdays always go by fast.
And Friday, we're leaving, so it's like two days, really.
It's like a cup of coffee.
It'll go by like that.
Is Florida not hot and muggy enough for these people?
They love heat.
If they ever decide to land men on the sun I think these old retired guys will be the only ones that will be able to handle it.
They'll sit there on the redwood benches, washcloth on their head, going: "I'm trying to get a sweat going".

{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
So I'm on the plane.
We left late.
Pilot says, "We're going to be making up some time".
lsn't that interesting?
They just make up time.
That's why you have to reset your watch.
Of course when they say they're making up time obviously, they're increasing the speed of the aircraft.
Now my question is, if you can go faster why don't you just go as fast as you can all the time?
Come on.
There's no cops up here.
Nail it.
Give it some gas.
We're flying.
Travelling, of course, is the best education.
You know, last year I was ill for 40, 45 countries and I would've gone to more, but I'd just got a puppy.
And he was too young to take with me.
But not now.
I won't travel without him.
-ls he on the plane now?
-Oh, yes.
Yes, he's in the baggage compartment.
I don't know why they won't let him sit up here with me.
He's a lot better behaved than most of the dregs you find onboard here.
You have any pets?
Just my next-door neighbour.
Well you are missing out on a relationship that could enrich your life in ways that you never even thought possible.
How about picking up their--?
You know.
You find that enriching?
-What's the matter?
-Oh, I'm feeling a bit queasy.
Sir, we're gonna make an emergency landing in Chicago and get you to a hospital.
My dog.
What about my dog?
You have a dog?
Do you know anyone on the plane, Mr. Palone?
Jerry.
How you feeling?
Would you take care of Farfel?
Farfel?
It's his dog.
We're landing in Chicago to get him to a hospital.
-Could you take his dog to New York?
-The dog?
-The dog?
-I'm sure it's only for a day or two.
But, you know-- What if, you know?
Give me your address and phone number.
I'll call you.
The dog?
Let go, Farfel.
Let go.
Give me that.
Give me that sneaker, you stupid idiot.
Shut up!
So, what would you do?
It's only been three days.
I'm sure he's gonna call.
Stop it!
Shut up!
Do you believe this?
Do you believe what I'm dealing with?
I got a wild animal in the house.
He'd deranged.
Maybe he's got rabies.
I can get lockjaw.
-lf only.
-Look at this place.
He's going everywhere.
I can't go out of the house at night.
I haven't performed in three days.
This will be my first night out since I got back.
Hey, when you walk him, do you?
Do I what?
Do you pick it up?
Yes, I pick it up.
-You pick it up?
-Well, you have to.
Oh, boy, would I love to see that.
Shut up!
Shut up, Farfel!
Stop it!
I don't know what to do.
What if I take it to the pound, then the guy shows up?
You should call the airline.
They might know where he is.
No, I tried.
They don't know anything.
You gotta put the syrup in first.
-No, milk.
-I'm telling you.
The guy's a drunk.
He's probably on a bender.
What is a bender anyhow?
I don't know.
They drink and they bend things at the bar.
I don't know.
I can't believe he hasn't called.
Two hundred seats on a plane I gotta wind up next to Yukon Jack and his dog Cujo.
Shut up!
One more day, and you are pound-bound!
Hey, I'm sorry.
I can't watch the dog tonight.
-Why?
-We're going to the movies.
We're gonna see Prognosis Negative.
I can't.
I gotta get this Ellen out of my life.
-You're breaking up?
-Oh, yeah.
The sooner the better.
I can't wait to do it.
You know some people you worry about whether or not you're gonna hurt their feelings?
With her, I'm looking forward to it.
Boy, I'd like to get it on video.
Watch it in slow motion and freeze-frame it.
Kramer, I don't know how you lasted as long as you did.
You didn't like her?
If you could see her personality it'd be like one of the Elephant Man exhibits where they pull off the sheet and everyone gasps.
I can't believe someone hasn't killed her yet.
How come you never said anything?
You can't tell someone how you feel about their girlfriend -till after they stop-- -I tell you.
You.
I'm talking about people.
Are we still going to the movies tonight?
No, I can't.
I gotta watch Farfel.
You and George can go without me.
-Just me and George?
-Sure.
But we need you.
What do you need me for?
Because.
-Yeah?
-Prognosis Negative.
Because I relate to George through you.
We're more like friends-in-law.
Besides, we said we'd see Prognosis Negative together.
Can't you put some newspapers down or something?
No, I can't trust him.
He gets insane.
I won't enjoy myself.
That's right, Farfel, I'm talking about you!
Just me and George alone?
Let's go, people.
Let's go.
It's Prognosis Negative time.
I can't go.
-You can't go?
Why not?
-Because I have to watch idiot Farfel.
-I thought Kramer was watching him.
-He's breaking up with his girlfriend.
What's the problem?
Just put newspaper down.
No, I don't want that smell in the house.
-You spritz a little Lysol on it-- -No.
It's like BO and cologne.
They combine forces into some kind of strange mutant funk.
So we're not going?
Nah.
You two go.
You still wanna go?
Do you?
If you want.
-It's-- It's up to you.
-Go ahead.
Well, I really wanted to see Prognosis Negative with Jerry.
You wanna see Ponce de Leon?
Ponce de Leon?
Okay.
-You sure you don't wanna go?
-I want to, but I can't.
Oh!
I tell you what.
How about if I come back here first and I clean everything up?
And I open up the windows, and if you're still not satisfied -we switch apartments for the night.
-No.
-What about this--?
-Forget it.
Go ahead.
You'll have a good time.
-I know.
It's not that.
-I just want you to go.
Well, thank you very much.
I'm telling you, one more day, stink breath!
On my block, a lot of people walk their dogs and I always see them walking along with their little poop bags which to me is just the lowest function of human life.
If aliens are watching this through telescopes they're gonna think the dogs are the leaders.
If you see two life forms, one of them is making a poop the other one's carrying it for him.
Who would you assume is in charge?
So how long did you live there?
About three years.
That's pretty long.
-It's not that long, really.
-Yeah.
-Do you--?
-So-- -And then you came here.
-Yeah.
So I've been here about six years.
'86, '87, '88, '89, '90 '91.
Yep.
Bad dog.
Bad dog!
You go outside!
Outside!
What do you want from me?
Tell me.
Money?
You want money?
I'll give you money.
How much?
I must have been out of my mind.
Look at you.
Why don't you do something with your life?
You sit around here all day.
You contribute nothing to society!
You're just taking up space!
I mean, how can I be with someone like you?
Wouldn't respect myself.
I like herbal tea.
Chamomile's good.
Lemon Lift.
Almond Pleasure.
Jerry likes Morning Thunder.
-Jerry drinks Morning Thunder?
-Yeah.
Morning Thunder has caffeine in it.
Jerry doesn't drink caffeine.
Jerry doesn't know Morning Thunder has caffeine in it.
-You don't tell him?
-No.
And you should see him.
Man, he gets all hyper.
He doesn't even know why.
He loves it.
He walks around going, "God, I feel great"!
-You don't tell him?
-No.
-That is so funny.
-I know.
Have you ever seen him throw up?
Please!
Please!
I take it all back!
Everything.
I take it all back!
Every word!
I love you!
I love you!
I can't live without you!
I'll do anything!
That's right.
Gavin Palone.
What?
You're sure?
He was released on Monday?
Last Monday?
Did he leave a phone number or address?
Unbelievable.
Well, thank you.
Thanks.
Thanks very much.
That's it, Farfel.
Party's over.
Start packing up your little squeeze toys, buddy boy.
You're checking out.
It was weird because George and I get along so great in so many situations but this was the first time we went one-on-one.
One-on-one's a whole different game.
Can't pass off.
The only time it wasn't uncomfortable was when we were making fun of you.
Hello.
Boy George, about time.
Beautiful.
How soon?
Okay, here's the plan: We take the dog to the pound, we go right to the movies.
Right.
You, me and Elaine.
Yes, all three of us.
I am going.
Okay, see you in five minutes.
-What?
-Do you have to?
What am I supposed to do?
I don't want to do it.
I like dogs.
I'm not sure this is a dog.
You know the guy might have just lost your number.
I'm in the book, and I have a machine.
Jerry, do you know what they do to dogs at the pound?
They keep them there for a week.
If nobody claims them, they kill them.
Really?
How late are they open?
-What?
-What is it?
I went back with Ellen.
-That's great.
-Great.
-Terrific.
-Yeah.
I really think you guys are good together.
Yes.
She understands you, and she is not demanding.
Do you think that I forgot what you two said about her?
-We're just trying to be supportive.
-Yes.
-We knew you were upset-- -From now on when we pass each other, I don't know you, you don't know me.
Oh, Kramer.
We didn't mean it.
-What are you doing?
-I'm getting my pot.
-Kramer, we like her.
-Kramer.
What did we say that was so bad?
I believe I referred to her personality as a potential science exhibit.
I said, "How come no one's killed her"?
-Well.
-Well.
Probably shouldn't have said anything.
I mean, everybody knows the first breakup never takes.
-Yeah?
-Prognosis Negative.
Great.
Okay, Farfel, put your shoes on.
Jerry, can't you just give it one more day?
-It's not his fault.
-It's not my dog.
I don't know where this booze hound is.
All right, I tell you what.
How about if you and George go to the movies and I stay here and watch the dog?
I can't let you do that.
What about Prognosis Negative?
We'll see it Sunday.
Tonight's the night, right?
Prognosis Negative.
I'm not going.
I'm gonna watch the dog.
-What does this mean?
-Well we'll go see something else tonight.
We'll see Ponce de Leon.
What is with this dog?
I thought we were taking it to the pound.
She talked me into one more day.
Talk.
I'm going to the bathroom.
Jerry, how long are you gonna be in there?
I don't know, regular human time.
Why don't you wait and go at the movies?
-Why shouldn't I go here?
-Well, you know.
Sometimes it's good to get there and make sure you get seats and then go to the bathroom.
-And isn't it more fun using the urinal?
-Yeah.
Oh, yeah, George.
Urinals are fun.
-Can I go?
-Hey, go.
-Who's stopping you?
-What, are you doing me a favour?
Like we care if you go to the bathroom.
-How's it going?
-Good.
-You?
-Things are good.
-Boy, he takes such a long time.
-I know.
You know what he does in there?
He gargles.
Jerry gargles?
That why he takes so long?
Yeah, he does it like six times a day.
-How come we never hear him?
-Because he does it quiet.
He does it quiet.
Lookit-- Just like this.
Watch.
Wait, wait.
Did you ever see him throw up?
We talked about that already.
I have nothing to say to anybody anymore.
I'm so uninteresting.
I'm think I'm out of conversation.
So why do you call me six times a day?
All I know about is sports.
That's it.
No matter how depressed, I can always read sports.
I could read the sports section if my hair was on fire.
You know what, Ponce de Leon is sold out.
It is.
Oh, yeah, you're right.
What else is playing?
Nothing except Prognosis Negative.
Boy, I know she really wants to see that with me.
Give me that jacket, mud face.
This is not Seinfeld you're dealing with.
When I get through with you, you'll be begging to go to the pound.
Shut up.
Shut up!
Hello?
No.
Who's calling?
Oh, my God.
The dog guy.
Well, where have you been?
Yeah?
Well, you better pick up your dog tonight or he has humped his last leg.
I could understand if there was something else playing but it's this or nothing.
-I don't know what to do.
-What is this saving movies thing?
-Something's playing, you go.
-I know.
I know.
So we're gonna do nothing now?
-This is crazy.
-lt is kind of silly.
-Of course it is.
-I mean, it's just a movie-- -Exactly.
-It's not like she's in the movie.
Right.
We're supposed to ruin the night because she wants to see it?
If I could have seen it with her, fine.
But I can't control these circumstances and schedules -and people's availabilities.
-She'll still see it.
-You're not stopping her-- -How does sitting next to a person in a movie theatre increase the enjoyment?
You can't talk during a movie.
This is stupid.
Come on.
-Let's just go.
-Good.
-Saving movies.
-Ridiculous.
Two for Prognosis Negative.
-I'm in big trouble.
-Oh, you're dead.
Bell's Palsy.
The entire side of-- Of my face was paralysed.
Farfel.
You know, I couldn't-- I couldn't-- I couldn't even feed myself.
I was completely incapacitated.
Quiet, Farfel!
-Farfel.
-It's interesting because I called the hospital and they said you were released on Monday.
Yes, that's true but then, see, I was taken to the Bell's Palsy Centre.
In-- In Rockville.
Absolutely first-- First-rate facility.
Top-- Top-notch physicians.
Hey, come on.
Come on.
Get off me.
He won't hurt you.
He's just playing.
Now you keep that mutt away from me.
Mutt?
I'll wager his parents are more pure than yours.
Kramer, are you coming?
-Oh, hi, Ellen.
-Get in here.
Listen, it's been a pleasure taking care of your dog for a week but if you don't mind.
Prediction: You'll be calling me to ask if you can come and visit him before the month is out.
Prediction: I never see you or him again for the rest of my life.
We made plans.
Why don't we just rent a movie?
I thought you wanted to see Prognosis Negative.
No.
It's supposed to be really bad.
Really bad.
I mean, it's long.
There's no story.
It's so unbelievably boring-- I heard.
I. Jerry, you promised me we'd go.
Well, George told me the whole story, line for line.
I almost feel like I've seen it already and walked out on it.
Wait.
George saw the movie?
I saw him yesterday.
He didn't mention it.
You and George got together?
Yeah.
I wanted to talk about how we had nothing to talk about.
Hello.
Hi, hi, hi.
What's up?
Well, you were right.
-About what?
-Ellen.
We broke up again.
Too bad.
I thought she was the one.
I'll bring back the pot.
Okay, come on.
It's movie time.
-Hey, what are you gonna see?
-Prognosis Negative.
-That's supposed to be great.
-It's not.
-Well, how do you know?
-I have an instinct for these things.
I had a parakeet when I was a kid.
That was the only pet I really enjoyed.
We used to let him out of his cage and he would fly around.
And my mother had built-- One entire wall of our living room was mirrored she felt this gives you a feeling of space.
Have you ever heard this interior-design principle?
The mirror makes it seem like you have another room.
Who walks up to a mirror and goes: "Hey, look.
There's a whole other room in there.
There's a guy in there, looks just like me"?
But the parakeet will fall for this.
You let him out.
He flies around.
Bang!
With his little head.
He would just go: I'd always think, even if he thinks the mirror is another room why doesn't he at least try and avoid hitting the other parakeet?
SDl Media Group
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Does it seem to you that the ventriloquist dummy has a very active sexual, social life?
He's always talking about dates and women that he knows and bringing them back to the suitcase at night.
There's always a sawdust joke in there somewhere, you know.
He says kinky things, because he's made out of wood and he can spin his head around.
We're somehow expected to believe because the face is so animated they think we're not noticing the feet are just swinging there.
Dummy feet never look really right, do they?
They're just kind of dangling there.
Always kind of askew, you know.
You always see a little ankle.
Those little thin, fabric ankles that they have, you know.
You think, "l don't think this thing is real".
Are you kidding me?
Let me speak with the head librarian.
It's absurd.
An overdue book from 1971?
This is a joke, right?
What are you, from a radio station?
Okay, you got me.
I fell for it.
All right.
Okay.
I can be down there in, like, a half-hour.
Bye.
-What's the problem?
-This, you're not gonna believe.
The New York Public Library says that I took out Tropic of Cancer in 1971 and never returned it.
Do you know how much that comes to?
That's a nickel a day for 20 years.
-It's gonna be $50,000.
-lt doesn't work like that.
If it's a dime a day, it could be 100,000.
It's not gonna be anything.
I returned the book.
I remember it very vividly because I was with Sherry Becker.
She wore this orange dress.
It's the first time I saw her in a dress like that.
I'd known her since ninth grade.
She was developing this body in secret under these loose clothes for, like, two years.
And then one day this orange dress.
-It's burned in my memory.
-Oh, memory burn, huh?
-I wonder whatever happened to her.
-How did they find you?
Oh, computers.
They're cracking down now on overdue books.
The whole thing's completely ridiculous.
It's George.
Wait till he finds out we're going to the library.
He'll be thrilled.
-You know, I never got a library card.
-I'm coming down.
It's all a bunch of cheapskates in there anyway.
People sitting around reading the newspaper attached to those huge wooden sticks trying to save a quarter.
Look, I gotta go to the library.
You wanna go?
Yeah, yeah.
Let's go.
The Dewey Decimal System.
What a scam that was.
Boy, this Dewey guy really cleaned up on that deal.
Where's George?
Look.
Trying to save a quarter.
I kind of like those sticks.
I'd like to get them in my house.
This woman's completely ignoring me.
Look at her.
This is a lonely woman looking for companionship.
A spinster.
Maybe a virgin.
Maybe she got hurt a long time ago.
She's a schoolgirl there was a boy.
It didn't work out.
So now she needs a little tenderness.
She needs a little understanding.
Needs a little Kramer, huh?
Then she'll need a little shot of penicillin.
-Yes?
-Yeah, I called before.
I got this notice in the mail.
Tropic of Cancer.
Henry Miller.
This case has been turned over to our investigations officer, Mr. Bookman.
Bookman?
The library investigator's name is actually Bookman?
-Come on.
-It's true.
That's amazing.
That's like an ice-cream man named Cone.
Well, Lieutenant Bookman's been working here 25 years so he's heard all the jokes.
-Can I speak with this Bookman?
-Just a second.
Jerry.
What?
I think I saw him.
-I think it's him.
-Who?
Did you see the homeless guy on the library steps screaming obscenities and doing callisthenics?
-Yeah.
-I think that's Mr. Heyman.
The gym teacher from our high school.
-Heyman?
Are you sure?
-He's older completely covered in filth, no whistle.
But I think it's him.
George got him fired.
He squealed on him.
-Oh, tattletale.
-I didn't tattle.
Well, what did this guy do?
What happened?
There was an incident.
I'd rather not discuss it.
-Oh, come on.
You can tell me.
-Some other time.
What, tonight?
-I never figured you for a squealer.
-He sang like a canary.
-Mr. Bookman's not here.
-Not here?
-Why was I told to come down here?
-He'll be out all afternoon on a case.
He's out on a case?
He actually goes out on cases?
What am I supposed to do now?
I'll have Mr. Bookman get in touch with you.
All right.
Thanks.
-Come on, let's go.
-Let's go see if it's Heyman.
-It's not him.
-Hey, I'll see you boys later, huh?
So, what's a guy gotta do around here to get a library card?
-Where's Karen?
-She went to pick up lunch.
Well she didn't ask me what I wanted.
She must've forgot.
How could she forget?
I've been ordering lunch every day for three and a half years.
Is there something you're not telling me because I'm getting, like, a really weird vibe.
Is Lippman getting rid of me?
You can tell me.
-I won't say anything.
-I don't know anything.
You don't know.
You see, "l don't know anything" means there's something to know.
If you really didn't, you'd say: "You're crazy".
-Oh, hi, Mr. Lippman.
-Elaine.
I was wondering if you got a chance to look at that biography of Columbus I gave you.
Yes, I did.
Yes, I did.
-Marie, this water is still too cold.
-Oh, yeah.
It's freezing.
Hurts your teeth.
I'm telling you, something is going on.
He never likes anything I recommend, and then that lunch thing.
So they forgot to get your lunch.
Big deal.
What do you know?
You've never worked in an office.
See, you've worked in an office, George.
You understand.
Jerry thinks I'm overreacting, but you understand lunch.
I don't understand lunch.
I don't know anything about it.
Just because I got the guy fired doesn't mean I turned him into a bum, does it?
-What did he do?
-He purposely mispronounced my name.
Instead of saying Costanza he'd say, "Can't stand you.
Can't stand you".
Remember, he made me smell my own gym socks once?
I remember he made you wear a jock on your head for a whole class.
-And the straps were hanging down.
-Okay, okay.
You never even had him for gym.
I had him for hygiene.
Remember his teeth?
It was like from an exhumed corpse.
Little baked beans.
Come on, tell me what happened.
Well, okay.
As I said, the guy had it in for me.
He actually failed me in gym.
Me.
And those spastic Schnitzer twins.
-Can't stand you!
-Yes, Mr. Heyman?
Your underwear was sticking out of your shorts during gym class.
Well, that's because I wear boxer shorts.
Boxer shorts, huh?
-What brand?
-I'm not really sure.
I-- Yeah, well, let's take a look!
He gave me a wedgie.
And he got fired the next day.
Why do they call it a "wedgie"?
Because the underwear is pulled up from the back until it wedges in.
They also have an atomic wedgie.
Now, the goal there is to actually get the waistband on top of the head.
It's very rare.
-Boys are sick.
-Well, what do girls do?
We just tease someone till they develop an eating disorder.
I gotta go back to the library and talk to him.
I gotta find out if I'm the guy that ruined his life.
Hey, babaloo, you better get home.
This guy Bookman from the library, he's waiting for you.
What's amazing about the library is here's a place where you can go in take out any book you want.
They just give it to you and say, "Bring it back when you're done".
Reminds you of that pathetic friend everybody had as a kid that would let you borrow any of his stuff if you would just be his friend.
That's what the library is.
It's a government-funded pathetic friend.
That's why everybody bullies the library.
"I'll bring it back on time, I'll bring it back late.
What are you gonna do, charge me a nickel"?
I'm glad you're here so we can straighten this out.
-Cup of tea?
-Got any coffee?
-Coffee?
-Yeah, coffee.
-No, I don't drink coffee.
-You don't?
-How about instant coffee?
-No, I don't-- -No instant coffee?
-Well, I don't-- -Who doesn't have instant coffee?
-I don't.
Buy a jar of Folgers crystals, put it in the cupboard, you forget about it.
When you need it, it's there.
It lasts forever.
It's freeze-dried.
Freeze-dried crystals.
Really?
I'll have to remember that.
-You took this book out in 1971.
-Yes, and I returned it in 1971.
Yeah, '71, that was my first year on the job.
Bad year for libraries.
Bad year for America.
Hippies burning library cards.
Abbie Hoffman telling everybody to steal books.
I don't judge a man by hair length or musical taste.
Rock was never my bag.
But you put on a pair of shoes in the New York Public Library, fella.
Look, Mr. Bookman I returned that book.
I remember it very specifically.
You're a comedian.
You make people laugh.
-I try.
-You think this is all a big joke?
No, I don't.
I saw you on TV once.
I remembered your name from my list.
I looked it up.
Sure enough, it checked out.
You think because you're a celebrity, somehow the law doesn't apply?
-You're above the law?
-Certainly not.
Well, let me tell you something, funny boy.
You know that little stamp, the one that says "New York Public Library"?
That may not mean anything to you.
But that means a lot to me.
One whole hell of a lot.
Sure, go ahead.
Laugh if you want to.
I've seen your type before.
Flashy, making a scene, flaunting convention.
Yeah, I know what you're thinking: "Why's this guy making such a stink about old library books"?
Well, let me give you a hint, junior.
Maybe we can live without libraries, people like you and me.
Maybe.
Sure, we're too old to change the world.
But what about that kid sitting down opening a book right now in a branch at the local library and finding drawings of pee-pees and wee-wees in The Cat in the Hat and The Five Chinese Brothers?
Doesn't he deserve better?
Look, if you think this is about overdue fines and missing books you better think again.
This is about that kid's right to read a book without getting his mind warped.
Or maybe that turns you on, Seinfeld.
Maybe that's how you get your kicks, you and your good-time buddies.
Well, I got a flash for you, joy-boy: Party time is over.
You got seven days, Seinfeld.
That is one week.
-What's wrong?
-It's Bookman, the library cop.
-So?
I didn't do anything wrong.
-I'm supposed to be at work.
I could get fired.
I never should've come here.
Why don't you leave?
I can't.
There's no way I'm paying that!
I returned that book in 1971!
I have a witness.
Sherry Becker.
She wore an orange dress.
She gave me a piece of Black Jack gum.
I said, "Liquorice gum.
What will they think of next"?
I remember it!
Becker, Becker.
Kevin went to a public school.
He's the 14 year old.
We were gonna send Marsha to a private school because in some ways, they don't Iearn enough, I think.
So, Sherry, what do you remember about that day at the library?
I remember it like it was yesterday.
It was a Friday afternoon.
-I wore a purple dress.
-Purple?
-You sure it wasn't orange?
-Positive.
And I was chewing Dentyne.
I always chewed Dentyne.
Remember, Jerry?
Dentyne?
-No Black Jack?
-Liquorice gum?
Never.
What else?
We were reading passages to each other from that Henry Miller book you had.
-Tropic of Cancer.
-No.
Tropic of Capricorn.
-Tropic of Capricorn?
-Remember?
"What holds the world together as I have learned from bitter experience is sexual intercourse".
Wait a second, wait a second.
You're right.
I had both of them.
We read from Tropic of Capricorn.
I was all set to return Tropic of Cancer.
And then.
-George, here's the book.
-Oh, man.
Don't let anybody see it.
Don't let anything happen to it.
Jerry, it's me, George.
Don't worry.
I'll return it tomorrow.
All right.
I'll see you after school.
I'm late for Heyman's hygiene.
-Where are you going?
-lt was nice seeing you again.
I just remembered something.
I've gotta go.
It was George!
Read another poem.
Pressed chest Fleshed out west Might be the saviour Or a garden pest That is great poetry.
You should be published.
It's great.
Well, the library's kind of a cool place when it's closed.
Oh, yeah.
You don't have to be quiet.
Listen to the echo.
-Hello!
-Hello!
-Hello!
-Hello!
-Hello!
-Hello.
Mr. Bookman.
I remember when the librarian was a much older woman.
Kindly, discreet, unattractive.
We didn't know anything about her private life.
We didn't wanna know about her private life.
She didn't have a private life.
When you think about that, think about this: The library closes at 5:00, no exceptions.
This is your final warning.
Got that, kewpie doll?
Lippman wants to see me in his office.
-See me.
That can't be good.
-Maybe you're getting a raise.
Maybe I'm getting a wedgie.
-What?
-It's George.
-George is on his way up.
-Wait till I tell him about the book.
Are you okay?
-What?
-It's-- It's Marion's poetry.
-I can't take it!
-Oh, Kramer.
Remember that biography I recommended?
-My boss hated it!
-I'm right here.
Oh, sorry.
-Remember that Columbus book?
-Columbus.
Eurotrash.
Well, it's definitely him.
-Him?
Him who?
-Him who?
Heyman him.
Heyman, the gym teacher?
-You found him?
-Oh, I found him.
He was sitting on the steps of the library.
I sat down next to him.
He smelled like the locker room after that game against Erasmus.
That was double overtime.
I said, "Mr. Heyman it's me, George Costanza.
JFK, '71".
He doesn't move.
So I said: "Can't stand you.
Can't stand you".
He turns and smiles.
The little baked-bean teeth.
I get up to run away but something was holding me back.
It was Heyman.
He had my underwear.
Here I was on the steps of the 42nd Street library a grown man getting a wedgie.
At least it wasn't atomic.
It was.
So, Georgie boy, guess what happened to Tropic of Cancer.
-How should I know?
-Because I gave it to you.
-Me?
-Yeah, think.
Don't you remember?
You kept begging me to see it.
Then finally, I agreed.
You were supposed to return it.
I met you in the gym locker room and gave it to you.
The locker room.
-George, here's the book.
-Oh, man.
Don't let anybody see it.
Don't let anything happen to it.
It's me, George.
Don't worry.
I'll return it tomorrow.
All right.
I'll see you after school.
I'm late for Heyman's hygiene.
-Can't stand you!
-Yes, Mr. Heyman?
Your underwear was sticking out of your shorts during gym class.
-That's because I wear boxer shorts.
-Boxer shorts, huh?
-What brand?
-I'm not really sure.
Yeah, well, let's take a look!
Anyway, I hope there's no hard feelings.
Hard feelings?
What do you know about hard feelings?
Ever have a man die in your arms?
Ever kill somebody?
-What is your problem?
-What's my problem?
Punks like you.
That's my problem.
You better not screw up again, Seinfeld.
Because if you do, I'll be all over you like a pit bull on a poodle.
That is one tough monkey.
-So you were saying?
-So I took your suggestion and I gave my boss Marion's poems the ones that affected Kramer so much.
-Oh, beautiful.
Did he like them?
-No, he didn't.
No, he didn't.
-Was he out there?
-No, he's gone.
-I wonder what happened to him.
-I guess we'll never know.
Can't stand you.
Can't stand you.
Can't stand you.
Can't stand you.
Any day that you had gym was a weird school day.
You know what I mean?
It started off kind of normal.
You have, like, English, geometry, social studies and then suddenly, you're, like, in Lord of the Flies for 40 minutes.
You're hanging from a rope.
You have hardly any clothes on.
Teachers are yelling at you, "Where's your jockstrap"?
You know.
Kids are throwing dodge balls at you.
You're trying to survive.
Then it's history science, language.
There's something off in the whole flow of that day.

{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
It's hard to find a store in a mall.
They have a directory but the problem with it is, even if you figure out where you are and where you wanna go you still don't really know, sometimes, which way to walk because it's an upright map.
If you had, like, suction-cup feet, then you could just walk right up on it.
Then you could tell, you could be on it going, "All right, I'm here.
I wanna go to the Gap.
That's down there.
All right, I'll just walk that way".
But people would know.
They would see you walking down the mall going: They'd go, "That's one of those suction-cup guys.
I heard about that guy.
He's never lost".
One left.
What a joke.
-You can have this one.
-That's not enough BTUs for my living room.
This was a waste of time.
I didn't get one either.
Why do I always have the feeling everybody's doing something better than me on Saturdays?
-This is what people do.
-No, they don't.
They're out on some big picnic, they're cooking burgers making out on blankets.
They're not at some mall in Jersey watching their friends trying to find the world's cheapest air conditioner.
You should see what my father used to do before he bought a new car.
He'd go from state to state.
He was away for weeks at a time.
Like he's running for president and going through the primaries.
We'd get phone calls from New Hampshire.
We took a little ride, what's the big deal?
At least you accomplished something.
You got fish.
Oh, big accomplishment.
Fish.
What do they do?
-What do you do?
-Hey, this way!
Jerry, what time do you have?
I have 5:00.
-Always late.
Always late.
-You're not late.
I told them to meet me in front of my building at 6:1 5.
-Who?
-My parents.
It's their anniversary.
I'm taking them out to dinner and a show tonight.
-Think we'll hit traffic?
-Of course.
It's rush hour.
-lsn't it the other way?
-There's no other way.
Everybody goes every way all the time.
-But it's Saturday.
-You got the picnic and burger traffic.
-There's picnic traffic?
-As my grandfather used to say: "Sometimes even a picnic's no picnic".
I always get myself in this position.
Can't be on time.
Gotta rush.
What's the matter?
I have to go to the bathroom.
Why do they hide the bathrooms in these malls?
-You want me to help you with that?
-No, I got it.
What do you think, Georgie boy?
Did I need that pointed out for me?
What is that gonna do for me?
How does that help me, to see her?
I'm trying to live my life.
Don't show me that.
Well, if you like her, go and talk to her.
Yeah, women love to get approached in parking garages.
I'll go up and say, "Hi, how you doing?
Would you like a glass of white wine"?
You get within 15 feet, she'd have her finger on the Mace button.
That was a guy.
-That was a guy?
-Where's the car?
Well, I thought it was here.
You don't know where we parked?
-Oh, this is great.
-Look, I thought it was Green 22.
I remember Orange.
I thought it was Orange.
-I didn't pay attention.
-This is just what I need.
I'm sure it's right around here.
Yeah, it looks familiar.
I remember the elevator.
There's elevators all over!
Everything looks the same!
We're like rats in some experiment.
It's over there.
I know where it is.
-It's black, right?
-Well, it's dark brown.
In a parking lot, you write it down.
How hard is that?
There it is.
No, no.
That's a Toyota.
-I thought it was.
-Hey, didn't we come in over there?
I thought we came in over there.
How long can fish live in one of these plastic bags?
I don't know.
Maybe two hours.
You better find this car.
Let's try this way.
I really have to go to the bathroom.
Why don't you just go behind one of these cars.
-Why?
There's nobody around.
-I'll wait.
You hold it in like that, you can cause a lot of damage to your bladder.
That's what happens to truck drivers.
They hold it in all the time and eventually -it starts to come out involuntarily.
-All right.
Jerry, are you aware that adult diapers are a $600-million-a-year industry?
Maybe I should just go any time I get the urge, like you, wherever I am.
There's too much urinary freedom in this society.
I'm proud to hold it in.
It builds character.
-ls that it?
-No.
Hey!
Watch it!
Maniac.
You sure you don't want help with that?
I'm gonna put it down behind that car.
Worried somebody's gonna pee on it?
-It's Purple 23.
Remember that.
-Oh, I got it.
That I'm supposed to remember.
Where the car is, that's insignificant.
I think they're labouring.
Look at this place!
It's huge!
All right, let me say this to you: If I am not in front of my building at 6:15, when my parents get there they're gonna put me on an aggravation instalment plan that will compound, with interest, for decades.
Parents never forget a foul-up.
I once left my jacket on a bus when I was 14.
I was flying to Chicago, last week, on a plane: "Make sure you hang on to your jacket".
There's no way you can call them?
-Yeah, I'll call them on their car phone.
-What would it take -for his parents to get a car phone?
-Hypnosis by aliens.
-Where the hell is this car, Kramer?
-We need a system.
Well, it's gotta be here.
Why are they using so many colours?
The numbers go up to 40.
Maybe it's not on this level.
-What?
-There's four different levels.
Maybe we're on the wrong level.
-How long was the escalator ride up?
-lt felt like a couple of levels.
You should always bring a pad and a pen.
I can't carry a pen.
I'm afraid I'll puncture my scrotum.
I got a pen.
Where is the bathroom in this mall?
There's 600 stores, I didn't see one bathroom.
What is this, like, a joke?
Don't they consult with a urologist when they build one of these places?
-What's with you?
-My ear itches.
Don't you dare talk to me like that, you hear me?
I told you, I don't care!
You'll have to wait!
Hey, hey, is that really necessary?
Why don't you mind your own business.
Well, I think hitting a defenceless child is my business.
-You're ugly.
-What?
-You're ugly.
-You are.
-You are.
-That's what you think.
That's what I know.
-I found it!
-He's got it!
-No, no, no.
-All right, that's it.
From now on, no more calling out "l found it" unless we're sitting in it.
Jerry, look at my fish.
-His eyes look a little cloudy.
-See?
Oh, those are your eyes.
Oh, they are gonna be furious.
-Who's got the tickets?
-I do.
I thought you knew this mall.
-You said you'd been here.
-lt was easy last time.
Okay, my fish are dying right in front of me.
We've gotta get someone to drive us around to us help look for the car.
No one's gonna do that.
Excuse me.
Hi.
We can't seem to find our car.
I was wondering if it would be possible to drive us around the garage for five minutes so we can look.
Sorry.
-Just five minutes.
-Can't do it.
We're not skinheads.
Excuse me.
I can't seem to find my car.
Do you think you could drive me--?
Oh, that's funny?
Is that funny?
Hey, tell me if you think this is funny: These fish are dying.
In an hour they'll be belly-up!
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Hey, sorry to have disturbed you.
Terribly sorry.
But the fish will be dead!
You do know that?
They can't live in plastic.
That's not me talking, that's science!
It's amazing how shopping makes me have to go.
How does my bladder know I'm in a department store?
Why don't you just go.
No, I can't.
-Don't you get tired of following rules?
-You think I'm too cautious?
Why be uncomfortable if you don't have to?
-It's organic.
-Organic.
So is Buddy Hackett.
-Buddy Hackett?
-He's a comedian.
I know.
-All right, all right.
-Hey, you can go over here.
I can manage.
George!
-Okay, let's go.
-But-- Come on.
Kramer.
I'm telling you, I've had this condition since I was 1 1 years old.
I've been in and out of hospitals my whole life.
I have no control over it.
Doctors have told me that when I feel it the best thing to do is just release it.
Otherwise I could die.
Do you hear what I'm saying to you?
I'm telling you that if I don't go, I could die.
Die!
Is it worth dying for?
-That's up to you.
-Oh, so you don't care if I die.
What I care about is the sanitary condition of the parking facility.
Why would I do it unless I was in mortal danger?
-I know it's against the law.
-I don't know.
Because I could get "uromysitisis" poisoning and die, that's why.
You think I enjoy living like this?
The shame?
The humiliation?
You know, I've been issued a public urination pass by the city because of my condition.
Unfortunately, my little brother ran out of the house with it this morning.
Him and his friends are probably peeing all over the place.
Jerry!
Jerry!
Unbelievable.
I'm never gonna get out of here.
Guy goes to pee, he never comes back.
It's like a science-fiction story.
Maybe he went to one of the other levels.
-I'm gonna look for him.
-Now you're gonna go?
-Be back in five minutes.
-lf you go now we'll find the car, Jerry will show up and we'll never find you!
I'll be right back.
What's the difference?
We'll all be dead eventually.
Does that bother you?
Yeah, it bothers me.
-Doesn't it bother you?
-Not at all.
Now, that bothers me even more than dying bothers me.
Because people like you live to be 120 because you're not bothered by it.
How can it not bother you?
Well, I once saw this thing on TV with people who are terminally ill.
Every one of them believed that the secret of life is just to live every moment.
Yeah, I've heard that.
Meanwhile, I'm here with you in a parking garage in Jersey.
That's a nice jacket.
Where'd you get that?
Some guy left it over at my mother's house.
First of all, you don't even know, technically, that I went.
That's for starters.
I mean, I could have been pouring a bottle of water out there.
-I know what you did.
-Oh, really?
Do you?
Well it just so happens that I did pour water out.
I had a bottle of very tepid water and I poured it out.
I could see how you made a mistake because pouring water out sounds very much like a person urinating.
And, you know, when you think about it it's really quite an amusing case of mistaken identity.
And that's all it is.
And now he's gone.
I'm sure he's looking for the car.
Five minutes, that's all.
I just wanna find him.
-I can't do it.
-But why?
Why can't you do it?
I can't.
That's not a reason, "You can't".
You just don't want to.
That's right.
But why?
Why don't you want to?
I don't know.
Well, wouldn't you get any satisfaction out of helping someone out?
No, I wouldn't.
All right.
All right.
I. I want to apologize.
I was frightened.
I said crazy things, I obviously offended you I insulted your intelligence.
The uromysitisis, the water bottle I made all that up.
And now I'm gonna tell you the truth.
Today my parents are celebrating their 50th-- Well, I'm jumping ahead here.
Their 47th wedding anniversary.
And we made plans to spend the evening together.
They're meeting me in front of my building at 6:15.
What I haven't told you or anyone else, for that matter is that my father's been in a Red Chinese prison for the past 14 years.
I mean, the guy had a fat fetish.
The inspector never dated a woman under 250 pounds.
-Really.
-What did he do with all that fat?
Does he just jump up and down on it?
Or does he gouge it like Killer Kowalski?
-Who's Killer Kowalski?
-He was a wrestler.
He would get down on his knees and he'd grab ahold of someone's stomach and squeeze it till they gave.
Hey, hey, hey.
I have to go to the bathroom.
Why don't you just go.
What, here?
You and Jerry.
It's.
Okay.
All right, I'm gonna go down this row.
What?
What did I do?
I didn't do anything.
Kramer!
Kramer!
What?
Don't you believe me?
It's their 47th anniversary.
You know, this is gonna kill them.
You're aware of that?
Kill them.
On the biggest night of their life.
Your folks have an anniversary today too?
Was your father also in a Red Chinese prison?
Red Chinese prison?
George!
George!
Jerry!
Jerry!
You know when you're walking with someone and you assume that they know where the car is?
And you're fine until you see them do this move.
Once they do this: When they look back from where they came from.
No, you're in bad shape now.
Nobody that knows where they're going does that.
Pilots on planes don't open the cockpit door and go: Well, what happened was my father was staying with one of China's great military leaders General Chang, who, by the way, came up with the recipe for General Chang's chicken.
The one with red pepper and orange peel -at Szechwan Gardens?
-I eat it all the time.
Spicy.
Apparently, General Chang is a flamboyant man.
Complete failure as a general, but a hell of a cook.
Look at this.
Look at this.
Will you look at this?
He doesn't have enough with the Mercedes, he has to have two spaces.
I tell you, you know what I'd like to do?
I'd like to spit on it.
I would like to see that.
-Should l?
Should I do it?
-Teach him a lesson he'll never forget.
-Who does he think he is?
-Someone's gotta stop him.
-It's against the law, isn't it?
-Well, it certainly should be.
Okay.
This is some machine.
Leave it to the Germans.
Let me ask you something.
What do they get for a tune-up on this?
-Jerry!
-Elaine!
Where have you been?
-I was arrested for urinating.
-Me too.
-You what?
-I have uromysitisis.
It's very serious, you know.
Jerry, look at my fish.
-ls he?
-No, but he's not looking good.
Please.
We can't find our car.
Please, just drive us around the parking lot to find our car.
-My fish are dying.
-Sorry.
Can't do it.
I can see not caring what happens to us.
We're human.
But what about the fish?
The fish?
Sorry.
That's right, go.
Go home to your dumbbells.
Go work on your pecs and your lats.
We're all really impressed.
Yeah, that's right.
You heard me.
-You got a problem with that?
-Elaine, shut up.
Don't worry, I'm packing heat.
Hey, hey.
Where's Kramer?
-I don't know.
-I thought he was with you.
Oh, see?
See?
I knew this was gonna happen.
Look at the time.
All right, that's it.
Did we look over there?
We check that side?
-We came in over there.
-We didn't come in over there.
-Where's Kramer?
-Look at these cars they all look exactly alike.
The fumes.
I can't breathe.
I'm having trouble breathing.
Hey, George, there she is again.
What are you doing?
You're killing me.
Ask her to drive us around.
There's your opening.
That is an opening.
Excuse me.
I'm really.
See, what happened -my friend forgot where he parked.
-Sure, I'll drive you around.
-You will?
-Sure.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We're late and my parents are waiting for me and we're stuck here.
Well, I wouldn't wanna get lost in here.
It smells like a toilet.
-People are such animals.
-You're telling me.
Filthy pigs.
It's a brown Ford.
This has happened to me too.
It's very frustrating.
I've asked several people.
They wouldn't even answer me.
I'm happy to do it.
I'm Michele.
Hi, Michele.
I'm George.
-Get out!
-But I didn't mean anything by it.
I don't even know L. Ron Hubbard.
I didn't know you were with that group.
What about my fish?
Boy, those Scientologists, they can be pretty sensitive.
I'll say.
What is it?
The car!
-The car!
-The car!
-The car!
-I can't believe it!
Kramer.
Kramer's not here.
I knew it.
I knew it.
I knew this would happen.
-Kramer!
Kramer!
-Kramer!
Kramer!
Hey, look.
Boy, I had a hell of a time finding that air conditioner.
You know I looked everywhere?
I completely forgot where I hid it.
You know where it was?
-Purple 23.
-Right.
Purple 23.
I could have used you.
Sometimes it's good to write those things down.
Oh, boy.
What time is it?
Well, at least there'll be no traffic.
Right.
Oh, boy.
-What time does that play start?
-8:00.
Well, that could be a problem.
Where's your little bag of.
All right, let's giddyup.
See, the problem with the mall garage is that everything looks the same.
They try to differentiate it.
They put up different colours, different numbers, different letters.
What they need to do is name the levels like: "Your mother's a whore".
You know what I mean?
You would remember that.
You'd go, "l know, I'm parked at 'My father's an abusive alcoholic.
' I know where I parked".

{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
There's always one location in your neighbourhood, one store that's constantly changing hands.
Everybody has this in their neighbourhood.
It's a leather store then it's a yoghurt shop, it's a pet supply.
It's constantly changing.
Nobody can do business there.
It's like some sort of Bermuda Triangle of retail.
Stores open up and then they just disappear without a trace.
Nobody knows what happened.
Eventually, when aliens land and the mothership from Close Encounters-- The bottom will slowly open and all these store owners will wander out in a daze, going, "l thought there was gonna be more walk-in traffic".
She thinks I'm nice.
-Women don't want nice.
-Amazing.
I haven't seen one person go in that restaurant since it opened.
-Poor guy.
-Why is nice bad?
What kind of a sick society are we living in when nice is bad?
What's that smell?
What are you wearing?
What?
A little cologne.
Manly.
-Monica wants me to wear it.
-Why didn't you say no?
I'm too nice.
Look at this poor guy.
His family's probably back in Pakistan waiting for him to send back money.
This is horrible.
She wants me to take an lQ test.
It's because you're stupid enough to wear the cologne.
No.
She's taking this course in education for her master's.
It's part of her research project, so I have to be a guinea pig.
I've never been a guinea pig.
Been a sheep, been a toady.
I can't talk to you anymore.
All right, I'm sorry.
Go ahead.
You're taking the lQ test.
She's gonna find out I'm a moron.
People think I'm smart, but I'm not smart.
Who thinks you're smart?
I won't break 100 on this thing.
-What thing?
-You don't listen anymore.
Oh, the lQ thing.
Yeah.
I'm sure I have a low lQ.
I've been lying about my SAT scores for 15 years.
-What did you get?
-What did I get, or what do I say I got?
-What do you say?
-I say 1409.
-1409, that's a good score.
-You're telling me.
What did you really get?
-You're my friend.
-Of course.
-I tell you everything, right?
-I hope so.
Well, this I take to the grave.
He's serving Mexican, ltalian, Chinese.
He's all over the place.
That's why no one's going in.
Why do you keep watching?
I don't know.
I'm obsessed with it.
It's like a spider in the toilet, struggling for survival.
And even though you know he's not gonna make it you root for him for a second.
Then you flush.
Well, it's a spider.
Sometimes people won't go in a place if they don't see anyone else in there.
Do you have to do that?
Jerry, don't do that.
That is so annoying.
Bazooka Joe.
-The buzzer?
-It's your house.
My house.
You gotta be on the lease to press the buzzer.
-Yeah?
-It's George.
Come on up.
-Casus belli.
-What's that?
It's Latin.
I read it in some book.
I just wanted to say it out loud.
Come on, go in.
Go in.
-Have you gone in there?
-No.
I'm afraid we'll start talking and I'll wind up going partners with him.
Hey.
I could probably shoot him from here.
I'd be doing us both a favour.
I'm wearing some cologne, all right?
Sure.
Fine.
Casus belli.
Casus belli.
-What's that?
-Since when do you wear cologne?
Why is what I do so important?
Why must I always be the focal point of attention?
Let me just be.
Let me live.
-How'd you do on that lQ test?
-I didn't take it yet.
-What lQ test?
-What's casus belli?
-Oh, it's nothing.
-ls it about me?
Why must you always be the focal point of attention?
Why can't you just be?
Why can't you live?
It's just a Latin phrase.
It does not mean anything.
Now, what is this test?
This woman he's dating is making him take this lQ test for this course.
-Oh, that sounds like fun.
-Yeah, fun.
IQ tests are totally bogus.
They prove nothing.
-You'll do well.
You're smart.
-No, see, he's not smart.
People think he's smart, but he's not.
What did you get on your SATs?
It varies.
-I don't even know my lQ.
-Mine's 145.
-One forty-five!
-Get out of here.
-You get out of here.
-You get out of here.
Maybe you should take the test for me.
That would be something, cheating on an lQ test.
Remember in college when you passed Lettick the test out the window?
-You became a legend after that.
-Yeah.
Yeah, I really had some guts back then.
-Why don't we do it again?
-What?
You could take the lQ test for me.
I'll pass it to you out of a window.
She lives on the first floor.
-You serious?
-Why not?
Where would I take the test?
She lives around the corner.
Take it here or go to the coffee shop.
-No, too noisy.
-Take it at the Dream Café.
You won't hear a peep.
-Hey, what do you think?
-Hey, I love a good caper.
Yeah, that's what it is, isn't it?
A caper.
You'll do it?
-What the hey.
-Yeah!
Beautiful!
Sorry.
-Welcome to the Dream Café.
-Well, I've been looking forward to it.
How did you hear about us?
People.
People are talking.
Smoking or nonsmoking?
We are proud to offer both.
-Nonsmoking would be great.
-Very good.
My name is Babu Bhatt.
I will be your waiter.
A steaming hot, folded face cloth for your pleasure.
-Thank you.
-Our specials are tacos moussaka and franks and beans.
Well, what do you recommend, my good fellow?
-The turkey.
-Well, the turkey it'll be.
May I say you have a splendid establishment here, my friend.
I'm sure you'll flourish at this location for many, many years.
You're a very kind man.
Very kind.
Thank you.
Very kind.
Very kind.
I am a kind man.
Who else would do something like this?
Nobody.
Nobody thinks about people the way I do.
Snap out of it, you stupid jerk.
You're eating a turkey sandwich.
You want a Nobel Prize?
You go in the living room, I'll take the test in here.
But why?
I won't be able to concentrate in front of you.
I think you're making too much of this.
IQ tests don't mean anything.
Are you kidding me?
This is the best tool we have today of measuring a person's intelligence.
Well, I certainly don't place any importance on it.
Well, I think you're wrong about that.
And now, if you'll excuse me, I'd really like to get started, please.
-Good luck.
-Don't need it.
What's going on?
I've been here 20 minutes.
I'm sorry.
Here's the test.
Thanks for doing this.
-What time do you want me back?
-Twenty to 3.
-Okay.
-Thanks again.
And don't settle for 145.
You can do better.
You're a genius.
Thank you, Babu.
You have quite a flair.
You are quite the restaurateur, I must say.
-lt is indeed my pleasure.
-Oh, please.
Welcome to the Dream Café.
-Our specials today-- -Oh, no, no.
I'll just have tea and toast.
-Tea and toast.
-Eat something!
Babu.
Okay.
Well, I'll have the rigatoni.
Oh, very good choice.
Very good.
So you got the test.
You're cheating.
I know.
-Hey.
-Hey.
Oh, boy.
Jerry, let me ask you something.
-Hi, Elaine.
-Hey.
This guy leaves this jacket at my mother's house two years ago.
She hasn't spoken to him since and now he says he wants the jacket back.
-So?
-Well, I'm not giving it back.
Why not?
Because I meet a lot of women in this jacket.
They're attracted to it.
Why do you think my mother went out with him?
-You all right?
-Yeah.
Okay.
What?
Anyway, it's been two years.
I mean, isn't there, like, a statue of limitations on that?
Statute.
-What?
-Statute of limitations.
It's not a statue.
No, it's statue.
Fine.
It's a sculpture of limitations.
Wait a minute.
Just wait a minute.
Elaine.
Elaine.
Now, you're smart.
Is it "statue" or "statute" of limitations?
-Statute.
-Oh, I really think you're wrong.
Kramer, I have to take this test.
I don't have a lot of time.
What test?
-An lQ test.
-Why are you taking an lQ test?
-It's for George.
-George?
Look, can I explain it to you later?
But why are you taking an lQ test for George?
Would you please?
!
-ls it for a job or something?
-Later!
-You're positive it's statute?
-Yes!
Yes!
Welcome, welcome.
A steaming hot face cloth-- -George?
-Yeah?
The door's locked.
Oh, it's locked?
I need to get something.
Monica, I'm really focused here.
This stuff's a killer.
-George!
-Wish I could.
Babu!
If you don't mind.
Okay.
-I'll get this.
-Oh, my God!
It's all over the test!
-I'm terribly sorry.
-Oh, man!
-I'm out of time, anyway.
-Please forgive me.
Please.
Go ahead.
I'll take care of it.
Please, I'm very sorry.
Tell your friends.
It's all right.
She was cheating anyway.
You're a very kind man.
Babu.
-You're Pakistani, right?
-Yes, Pakistani.
Yes.
Babu, may I say something?
Of course.
You're very smart man.
I listen.
I am not a restaurateur by any means, but it occurred to me that perhaps you might serve some dishes from your native Pakistan as opposed to, say, the franks and beans, for example.
-There are no Pakistani people here.
-lt doesn't matter.
You would have the only authentic Pakistani restaurant in the whole neighbourhood.
Yes.
You see everything, don't you?
Well, you know, not everything.
I do what I can.
I close down today.
And when I open again, it will be a Pakistani restaurant.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
You're a very special person.
Very special.
I am such a great guy.
Who else would've gone to the trouble to help this immigrant?
I am special.
My mother was right.
Of course, I've never had Pakistani food.
How bad could it be?
-lt was an accident.
-What, did you go on a picnic?
Babu Bhatt did it.
Babu Bhatt?
-How am I going to explain this?
-Time's up, George.
Okay.
-Here you go.
-How did you do?
-Piece of cake.
-What happened to the test?
What?
Oh, I spilled some food on it.
Food?
What food?
What are you talking about?
Where did you get food?
-From my pocket.
-Your pocket?
I had a sandwich in my pocket.
-And coffee?
-Yeah.
Had some coffee, yeah.
-Where did you get the coffee?
-Where did I get the coffee?
Where do you think I got the coffee?
At the grocery store.
-How did you get there?
-I walked.
How did you get out?
I didn't see you leave.
-I climbed out the window.
-You climbed out the window?
-Of course.
-Why didn't you go out the door?
The door?
Why would I go out the door?
The window's right here.
You're a fascinating man, George Costanza.
The average person sees a situation like this they walk right by it.
-Not me.
-You're very special.
Hey, do me a favour.
Some guy comes looking for me, tell him you don't know where I am.
Of course.
I always do.
No, no, it's that guy.
He's really been bugging me about the jacket.
-Just give it back to him.
-He'll have to kill me.
-Hey, Georgie!
-I'm coming up.
How did you do on the lQ test?
Eighty-five!
-What?
-Eighty-five, Jerry!
85 lQ.
Eighty-five?
Well, well, well.
He's coming up?
Well, I'm no genius but according to my calculations, he should be here in a few seconds.
Yeah, but an 85?
Jerry, that's ridiculous.
Well, maybe the test was gender-biased.
You know, a lot of questions on hunting and testicles.
Oh, hello, professor.
-George, I cannot believe-- -Please.
-No, there's gotta be a mistake.
-You should have seen her face.
It was the same look my father gave me when I told him I wanted to be a ventriloquist.
But an 85?
Listen, there were too many distractions there.
Babu whatever his name was.
And Kramer.
I couldn't concentrate.
It was a madhouse.
Jerry, it was.
-Let me take it again.
-Forget it.
Oh, come on.
Come on.
I'll guarantee you 140.
-What do you have to lose?
-You could do worse!
No.
No, come on.
I guarantee it.
-All right, I'll ask her.
-Okay.
Now, where am I gonna take it?
Take it here.
I'll leave.
There will be no distractions.
Well, congratulations, my friend.
Sorry I missed the grand reopening.
I was out of town for about a week.
You see how I listen?
I work very hard, borrow more money.
I think it's fantastic.
It has a certain indefinable charm.
-You wish to eat?
-Let me tell you something, Babu.
You go back in that kitchen, tell your chef I want the works.
Very good.
Very good?
No, not very good very great.
I am very, very great.
The lQ tests always have that sample question at the beginning where they show you how to fill in the circle.
This should be the first elimination point right there.
Anybody goes outside that circle: "You wanna come with us, please?
Yeah, you're done.
Your test is over.
You went outside the circle, okay"?
-What are you doing?
-Quiet.
Don't say anything.
-What's going on?
-Hey, Kramer!
I saw you go in there!
I'm not leaving till you give me that jacket!
-Open up, Kramer!
-What did you come in here for?
Well, I thought I'd throw him off.
See, he knows where I live.
Look, Kramer, I have to return this test.
I've gotta get out of here.
-I thought you took the test.
-I had to take it again.
-How come?
-What's the difference?
!
-Well, you can't leave now.
-What?
Come on, Kramer, I want that jacket back!
Never!
Come on, George, open up.
-Well?
-How you doing?
Where's the test?
You know, it's the damnedest thing.
I went out the window again to get a cup of coffee.
Babu.
Babu.
Babu you know, I've gotta tell you, I never do this, but the shrimp it's just a little stringy.
-You have any chicken?
-The shrimp is stringy?
-Well, maybe you refrigerated-- -Quiet!
-No, l-- -You shut up!
You make me change restaurant, but nobody come!
You say make Pakistani.
Babu Bhatt have only Pakistani restaurant.
But where are people?
You see people?
Show me people!
There are no people!
-I think I'll just take the check.
-You bad man!
You very, very bad man.
Bad man?
Could my mother have been wrong?
Are you looking for George?
Well.
Kind of.
George left.
Is that the test?
This?
Yeah.
-Here you go.
-Thanks.
I hope you do a lot better this time.
Actually, I think I did.
The first time, I couldn't really concentrate.
You know what it was?
Bad location.
Come on, let's not stand here too long.
We might run into her.
Aren't you cold?
Where's your jacket?
-Oh, sorry.
-I'm going upstairs.
Hey, guys.
I just ran into Monica.
You know what my lQ is?
One fifty-one.
-One fifty-one?
-Yeah.
That's a good score.
So, what are you up for?
How about Mexican?
-ltalian.
-No, Chinese.
You know what would be great?
It's tough to do a good deed.
Let's look at your professional good-deed doers: Your Lone Rangers, your Supermen your Batmen, your Spider-Men, your Elastic Men.
They're all wearing disguises.
Masks over their faces, secret identities.
Don't want people to know who they are.
Too much aggravation.
"Superman, thanks for saving my life but did you have to come through my wall?
I'm renting here.
They got a security deposit.
What am I supposed to do"?

{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
The transplant, the hair plug is really quite amazing.
Hair on your shower soap yesterday can be in your head tomorrow.
How do they do the transplant?
Did they have the guy take a shower, get his soap rush it in by helicopter?
You know, keep the soap alive on the soap-support system?
Then eventually move it over?
"We got the hairs, but I think we lost the Zest".
Sometimes the body rejects the transplant with organs.
Is it possible that a head could reject a hair transplant?
The guy's just standing around.
Suddenly: It lands in someone's frozen yoghurt.
You see, the gaskets that you have here are asymmetrical.
-Really?
-So I took off the motor relay on the compressor because you've got some discoloration.
-Oh, whatever you have to do.
-I was working with one mount at a time.
You know, because you don't want to disturb -the position of the compressor.
-No, you don't.
Hey, what are you listening to?
My show from last night.
-Oh, you taped it?
-Yeah, I was doing some new material.
Did you ever do that thing on the toes that I said?
You know, how, like, the big toe is, like, the captain of the toes.
But sometimes the toe next to the big toe gets so big that there's, like, a power struggle.
And the second toe assumes control of the foot.
-The coup d'é-toe.
-Yeah.
-Did you do it?
-Yeah.
-So?
-Nothing.
Nothing at all.
-I need the phone.
-Who you calling?
China.
-China?
-Yeah, I'll pay for it.
-What for?
-What for?
I'll tell you what for.
For hair.
-Hair?
-The Chinese have done it, my friend.
-The Chinese have done it.
-Done what?
-Discovered the cure for baldness.
-Did you see that last night?
It was on CNN.
This Chinese doctor, Zang Zhao has cured baldness.
-What's this?
-Oh, I just got it.
Spector gave it to me.
He's giving everything away.
He's becoming a minimalist.
Is that the guy who likes fat women?
Yeah.
Doesn't the fat fetish conflict with the minimalism?
You.
You should have watched that report on CNN last night.
I did.
I'm trying to call China.
You can't call China now.
It's like, what, 3:00 in the morning there.
-Oh, my God.
-What?
Oh, God.
Man.
Oh, brother.
I can't believe what I'm hearing.
This woman's talking to me on my tape recorder while I was on stage.
This is wild.
I never heard anything like this.
Listen.
I want to slide my tongue around you like a s-- Oh, my God.
-Let me hear.
-Wait, wait, wait.
-Who is this woman?
-I don't know.
I have no idea.
I was just listening, and she came on.
This is like a Penthouse letter.
-Why can't I meet women like this?
-Come on.
Wait!
Wait!
-Where was the tape recorder?
-Back of the room, on the ledge.
She must have been sitting right in front of it.
-My God.
-All right, come on.
-It's my turn.
-All right.
All right.
All right.
-How you gonna find out who this is?
-Good question.
Where's the volume?
What do the Chinese have to gain by faking a cure for baldness?
If it was real, they'd never let it out of the country.
Imagine no baldness.
It would be like a nation of supermen.
-Hi, boys.
-Hello.
-Hello.
-What's happening?
Tell her.
I want to hear her reaction.
This woman left this sexy message on Jerry's tape-- Not that, you idiot!
-What?
-The Chinese!
The Chinese bald cure!
-Oh, I thought you meant that-- -No, I meant the bald cure.
We were talking about the bald cure!
What did she say?
Seinfeld.
Hey, is that Beder?
I can't believe it.
Get me a cup of decaf.
So did you hear this message?
Man, it was unbelievable.
-Really?
-I can't get over it.
Sexy?
This woman drove us out of our minds.
Like, how did she sound?
She had this throaty, sexy kind of whisper.
Really?
Like.
Like: Jerry I want to slide my tongue around you like a snake.
Oh, my God.
You?
You?
That was you!
-How did you--?
-I stopped in the club to see him.
I was standing in the back while he was on.
There was this tape recorder there.
And I got this impulse.
-What?
-No, nothing.
Nothing.
Now listen, promise me you won't tell him.
I want to have a little fun with this.
I had no idea you were filled with such sexuality.
Oh, that was nothing.
So listen, what about this bald thing?
Some bald thing, a bald thing.
I don't know.
It's nothing.
-Remember Beder?
-Beder?
Yeah, you remember Beder.
I told you he went to the track that one time and he was yelling at this jockey.
And the jockey got off the horse and started chasing him.
So listen.
What about this girl on your tape recorder?
Oh, Elaine.
What do you think an enraptured female fan of mine might say?
I don't know.
She went on in some detail about certain activities illegal in some states, for consenting adults.
Things you would know very little about.
-Oh, really?
-Well this type of thing is very common when you're in show business.
So, what?
You gonna ask her out?
No, she didn't leave her name or number.
Bummer.
Okay.
Good luck finding her.
I'm taking off.
-Where are you going?
-Home.
What are you going home for?
I just came from the gym-- -Unless I can shower at your place.
-Sure.
Oh, my God.
Oh, man.
I don't get it.
Why would a woman do that and then leave no way to get in touch with her?
Maybe she realized she couldn't have you and jumped off the George Washington Bridge.
Yes.
Operator.
Beijing.
-Why are you doing this?
-Why do I do anything?
For women.
Elaine, have you ever gone out with a bald man?
-No.
-Know what that makes you?
A baldist.
Oh, this I need.
Hello, is this the hair restoration clinic?
Yeah, yeah.
Does anyone speak English?
You're taping.
Just be yourselves.
Oh, okay.
Well, we're talking with Elaine Benes adult film star on the set of her new picture Elaine Does the Upper West Side.
Hi, how you doing?
Well, I'm doing fine.
Do you speak English?
English!
Oh, here's the director, Jerry Seinfeld.
Jerry, you discovered Elaine Benes.
Well, yes I did.
That's true.
Couple of guys I knew in the Coast Guard told me about her.
And I sensed that she had the anger and intensity that I needed to make this film work.
English!
Does anybody speak English?
Nobody speaks English.
So, what scene are you getting ready to shoot now, Elaine?
In this scene, my co-star, who's right over here.
Follow me.
Is George Costanza.
And he plays an airline pilot who's just returned from Rome.
And I'm about to show him how much I've missed him.
That's my Chinese food.
So, George, is this your first movie with Elaine?
I don't know.
So, Elaine, in your movies, is the sex real, or is it simulated?
Oh, it's always simulated except with George.
That's in my contract.
All right, Kramer.
That's enough.
That's enough.
Yeah, hello?
Yeah, hello?
English!
Does anyone speak English?
-How much do I owe you?
-$1 5.90 -$15.90?
-Excuse me?
-Do you speak Chinese?
-Chinese?
Yeah.
Oh, look!
I'm on with Beijing at the hair restoration clinic.
Could you talk to them for me and tell them I'd like to place an order?
They've got a billion people over there.
He found a relative.
If you send money, they send cream.
They send me.
All right.
Ask them, does it really work?
They say you grow hair.
Look like Stalin.
Ask them, are there any side effects?
Impotence.
Oh, funny.
He's a funny guy, yeah.
Get a money order from the Bank of China.
Be here three days after they get check.
All right, thank you.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
Kind of an expensive call.
Thanks for driving me home.
What did I do to deserve this?
You do plenty.
So, what are you doing?
You're-- You're going in.
Well, yeah.
I guess so.
Why, you want to do something?
Yeah, I don't-- I don't know.
What?
There's really nothing to do.
Yeah, no.
There's-- There's nothing.
Can you think of anything?
No, no.
Not really.
I am up for anything.
Really?
I have to say you were really good doing that porno thing.
You're-- You're talented.
I was just kidding around.
That thing you said about the sex not being simulated.
That was really funny.
Yeah, that was fun.
So I'll speak to you through Jerry and everything.
Okay.
-Thanks a lot for the ride.
-Yeah, anytime.
Thanks a million.
I appreciate this.
You're sure this was the woman at the table where I had my tape recorder?
Okay, great.
Thanks, again.
Bye.
Who do these women think they're dealing with?
Did she think she was gonna leave this incredibly erotic message on my tape, and I was just gonna let it go?
Not bloody likely.
What is that?
-It's my cockney accent.
-No, no.
That's no good.
Let's hear yours.
Not bloody likely.
That's the worst cockney accent I ever heard in my life.
Hey, Georgie boy, guess what I got.
Guess what I got.
Oh, is that the bald stuff?
From China.
All the way from China.
Wait, wait.
Let me get the camera.
No, don't get the camera.
We don't need the camera.
I know you're sceptical, but I believe in the Chinese.
Yes, I am sceptical.
Why do you have to be so suspicious of everyone?
This is a great man, Zang Zhao.
He wants to help bald people.
Wait, wait.
Let's videotape your head for the before picture.
So we can watch how it grows and stuff.
-Here, sit down.
-All right.
All right, lean back.
A little bit to the right.
Now make sure you get this area here.
-That's where he needs help.
-All right.
Well, he's a happy camper, huh?
Happy camper.
Yeah, I don't hear that expression enough.
Remember that guy who took my jacket?
The one I found at my mother's house?
-Yeah.
-My mother told me that he got arrested for mail fraud.
-No kidding.
-Yeah, he's in jail.
What about the jacket?
He take it with him?
That's what I intend to find out.
Well, you can see it.
Are you gonna walk around like that?
And it stinks.
Can you smell that?
You stink.
How long are you supposed to leave it on for?
All day.
-Hello?
-Hello, it's Elaine Marie Benes.
-Well, hello.
-Hello.
Did you find out who that woman was?
Yes, I got her number.
-Hey, is that Elaine?
-Yeah.
Hi, Elaine!
So I guess you figure you're in for a pretty wild night.
Well, as I said this type of thing is very common in show business.
Well, listen, I'm at Arlene's.
You want me to stop by?
-Sure.
-Okay, bye.
Bye.
-Did she say "hello"?
-What?
Oh, I don't know.
What do you mean?
She heard me say hello.
Did she say hello back?
I don't know.
Who keeps track of hellos?
Isn't it polite to say hello when somebody says hello?
She's coming up.
-Elaine's coming up?
-Yeah, why?
What's wrong?
-Where are you going?
-Nowhere, nowhere.
I'll be right out.
How often do you cut your toenails?
I would say every two and a half to eight weeks.
Because the other night I was sleeping with Marion and I rolled over, and l cut her ankle with my big toe.
The big toe, the captain.
-What?
-The captain of the toes.
-Hello?
-Jerry?
-Yeah.
-Jerry, listen.
I got too much to do.
I can't come over.
Forget it.
Oh, okay, too bad.
So when are you gonna call her?
As soon as I get off the phone with you.
-Good luck.
-Okay.
-Bye.
-Bye.
-What happened?
You took it off?
-Yeah.
That was enough.
That's it?
You gave up?
No, I'm working on a system.
Who was that?
That was Elaine.
She changed her mind.
She's not coming over.
-Hello?
-Hello, is this Alisha?
-Yes.
-This is Jerry Seinfeld.
-So?
-I don't get this woman.
We're having a great time, couple of laughs.
Everything's nice.
End of the night, I go in for contact.
I get the pullback.
This woman, she said the filthiest things I ever heard in my life.
And I get the pullback.
-Yeah?
-It's George.
Come on up.
What is he doing here now?
So you blew it?
She must be psychotic or something.
Let me have the number.
I'm not giving you the number.
I know how to handle these psychotics.
Sheriff.
What's with the hat?
Boy, you stink.
-What are you doing here now?
-I have to talk to you.
Let's take a look here, see what we got.
Wait a second.
I think I see something here, George.
-Let's go to the videotape.
-Oh, Kramer.
No, no.
-What's up?
-I can't tell you now.
-He'll be back in 10 seconds.
-Start it.
-I can't.
-Oh, come on.
He'll be over there for a half-hour.
He gets lost over there.
-Come on.
What is this about?
-All right.
I've become attracted to Elaine.
All right.
-Sit down.
-Could we do this later?
No, I got the tape right here.
Kramer, let's do this later.
Okay, now.
This is the tape that we made earlier.
And I think that I see a couple of buds right here.
-Really?
You think?
-Yeah.
Kramer, I would like to talk to George for a minute, please.
-About what?
-It's kind of private.
Like the big toe captain?
What?
-Oh, so you're doing my bit?
-I'm not doing the bit!
All right.
Okay, all right.
I'm gonna take a look at this, huh?
-Does she know?
-No.
-How did it happen?
-I can't say.
-Well, why can't you say?
-Because I promised her.
-I thought you said she doesn't know.
-She doesn't.
-So how can you promise her?
-Because she asked me to.
What is this, an Abbott and Costello routine?
All right, you really want to know?
It all started when she told me that she was the voice on your tape recorder.
What?
Elaine?
Yeah.
She made me promise not to tell.
It was supposed to be a joke.
-That was Elaine?
-Yeah, let me hear.
-Wait a second!
Give me a second-- -You heard it 50 times already-- She's my ex-girlfriend.
I think I have precedence.
-Yeah?
-Hi, it's Elaine.
Is this a bad time?
Yeah.
Don't tell her I told you!
She'll kill me!
Okay, I promise!
Oh, man.
Oh, God.
Oh, brother.
-What's the matter?
-I got a pain in my side -from, you know-- -Hi, George.
Hi, how you doing?
Something stinks in here.
What are you doing here?
I was the one who talked into your tape recorder.
I know.
George told me.
-You told him?
-He threatened me.
Where did you come up with all that stuff?
-Oh, that was nothing.
-Elaine.
-I have to tell you something.
-George, no.
-No, no.
-George, I'm telling you-- What is it?
I'm very attracted to you.
I found a hair!
Yes!
Okay, come here.
Come here.
Take a look at this.
Ever since I found out that you left the message on Jerry's tape recorder-- -That was you?
-lt was a joke.
Wait.
Oh, my God.
Oh, yeah.
Elaine, I can't believe that that is you.
I think I'll get going.
Stick around a while.
-It's early.
-We'll order Chinese.
Give me the tape.
Give me the tape.
A woman left a message on my phone machine with kind of a breathy voice.
No matter what a woman says, if it's in that breathy voice, you know.
"You have cancer".
"Really"?
Sounds pretty good.
The stewardess could lean over and whisper in my ear: "Would you put on your seat belt.
We're about to go into a mountain".
I'd go, "Really, so what are you doing later by the ruptured remains of the fuselage?
How about some peanuts over by the black box?
I'll meet you there".

{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Give me an explanation why the pharmacist has to be two and a half feet up above everybody else.
What the hell is he doing he can't be on the floor with you and me?
Brain surgeons, airline pilots, nuclear physicists, we're on the same level.
Oh, no, he's gotta be two and a half feet up.
"Look out, everybody, I'm working with pills.
Spread out, give me some room".
The only hard part of his whole job that I could see is typing everything onto that little, tiny label.
And has to try and get all the words on there keep the little piece of paper in the roller of the typewriter.
Oh, no.
He's gotta be two and a half feet up.
"Yeah, I'd like to get this prescription filled".
"All right.
You wait down there.
Only I'm allowed up here".
-Where'd you meet her?
-I met her on an elevator.
On an elevator?
You met a woman on an elevator?
-lmpossible, right?
-You got less than 60 seconds.
That's like dismantling a time bomb.
-What got into you?
-I don't know.
She was so beautiful it was a pure reflex.
The words -just came out of my mouth.
-Wow.
What did you say?
You know, I'm the one responsible for those crop circles in England.
-Can you believe I did that?
-What did she say?
What crop circles?
-Not a good sign.
-Not everybody knows what the crop circles are.
You know what the crop circles are?
Crop circles?
Why don't you buy something?
You got something in your teeth.
-What?
-It's green.
Oh, man, spinach.
I've been walking around like this all afternoon.
-You bump into anybody you knew?
-I had a job interview.
-How did it go?
-Take a guess.
Well, Mr. Costanza, we have nothing available at the present time but should anything open up, we'll be in touch.
Okay, thanks.
You don't need a job.
You got Audrey.
Yeah.
Right.
-What's the matter?
-No.
Nothing.
-What?
-You won't think I'm a bad person?
Too late for that.
Because, believe me, I would only say this to you and maybe a psychiatrist.
What is it?
Well.
Her nose is a little big.
Yeah, she's got a big nose.
I mean, big would even be okay.
It's beyond big.
It's a schnoz.
I'm aware that my own physical dimensions -are a little short of perfection.
-A little.
Who am I to be thinking about someone's nose?
I should be grateful someone like her looks at me.
I have no job, nothing.
But I have to say, I think about the nose.
I don't wanna think about it, I don't ask to think about it, but I think about it.
I go to bed, I tell myself, "Don't think about the nose".
I think about it.
I look at her, I see the nose.
Stop being so concerned with looks.
-Have you said anything to her?
-No.
Could never do that.
The ironic thing is, if she had a smaller nose I never could've dated her.
She'd be out of my league with a smaller nose.
And I really like her.
I know that.
And I know one other thing: I'm not getting past that nose.
All right, shut up.
Here they come.
How can I not think about it?
Look at the size of this thing.
My mother's going out with this guy who leaves a jacket in her house.
She gives to me.
Well, two years later, he shows up and takes it back.
Now he's in prison.
Got arrested for mail fraud.
So, Elaine, go over to the apartment, tell the landlord you're his daughter and you wanna bring him the jacket.
Won't the landlord know I'm not the daughter?
No, he's never met her.
She's in California.
-Are you coming with me?
-Yeah, I have to.
I'm your fiancé.
Peter Von Nostrand.
Why don't you just commit yourself already?
What is so special about this jacket?
-No, you don't wanna know.
-God.
He believes it possesses some extraordinary power over women.
What's that splotch on your hand?
I got stamped at the reggae lounge last night.
I'm going back there tonight.
I'm not gonna pay another cover charge.
You didn't wash all day?
Yeah, I washed.
Just not the hand.
You wouldn't believe the women at this club.
Man.
It's amazing how many beautiful women live in New York.
I actually find it kind of intimidating.
You're as pretty as any of them.
Just need a nose job.
-Kramer!
-What?
What?
How could you say something like that?
What do you mean?
I just said she needs a nose job.
No, no.
There's nothing wrong with her nose.
-God, I'm so sorry, Audrey.
-Oh, it's okay.
-What did you have to say that for?
-I was just trying to help out.
Yeah, well, you can kiss that jacket goodbye, Mr. Von Nausen.
You see what happens when you try to be nice?
But what would the world be like if people said whatever they were thinking all the time, whenever it came to them?
How long would a blind date last?
About 13 seconds, I think.
"Sorry, your rear end is too big".
"Okay, your breath stinks".
"See you later.
No problem.
Goodbye".
"Okay, thank you very much".
Elaine said I can stay with her another month till Tina gets back.
What are you thinking about?
Thinking?
Nothing.
What could I possibly be thinking?
You look like you've got something on your mind.
Yeah, right.
I wish I had something on my mind.
So how about that Kramer?
Yeah, how about him?
-The way he just says stuff.
-He sure does.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, he's quite a character.
So, what did you think?
About the pizza?
No.
About the nose job.
Oh, the nose job.
Yeah.
I don't know.
I-- -Well, what did you think?
-Well, I've thought about it -but I don't know.
-Yeah.
You know, not that I care one way or the other but these doctors today do amazing things.
If you were so inclined.
-And again, I'm not suggesting.
-I know.
They're good.
Peter Jennings had one.
-Really?
-Probably.
They all do.
In my high school, half my graduating class had them.
Of course, I'm from Long lsland, so.
It's really nothing.
It's like going to the dentist.
-I hate the dentist.
-It's a cleaning.
So you really think I should do this.
If it makes you happy.
I don't focus on these things.
I will tell you this, though.
Unfortunately we live in a very superficial society.
I don't condone it but it's a fact of life.
Well, maybe I should.
-What the hell?
-Now you talked her into a nose job?
-Me?
I didn't say anything.
-You encouraged her to get one.
-I didn't encourage.
No encourage.
-"Peter Jennings had one"?
It's possible.
-You should accept her for who she is.
-No, George is right.
-I wanna get one.
-I think it's a mistake.
Me too.
Really.
Unless you'd really like one, then.
I'm going straight to hell.
No two ways about it.
It might not be hell, but you're gonna run into bad dudes.
Get the check.
She takes the bandages off at 4:00.
We have time.
It's exciting.
She's gonna have a new face.
-lt is exciting.
-Not as exciting as Miss Crop Circles.
Please, please.
Isabel?
She is the most despicable woman I have ever met in my life.
I have never been so repulsed by someone mentally and so attracted to them physically at the same time.
It's like my brain is facing my penis in a chess game.
And I'm letting him win.
You're not letting him win.
He wins till you're 40.
-Then what?
-He still wins, but it's not a blowout.
She wants to be an actress.
She makes me read these moronic acting scenes with her, and I do it.
Because I'm so addicted to the sex, I'm helpless.
I'll do anything.
So, finally, Kramer comes in the other day.
I don't want to see this woman anymore but I haven't got the willpower to throw out her number.
Please help me.
Help me.
I'm proud of you.
So I'm never gonna see her again.
I'm going cold turkey.
Good for you.
I'll tell you, the sex.
I was like an animal.
I mean, it was just completely uninhibited.
It's like going to the bathroom in front of a lot of people, and not caring.
It's not like that at all.
How do you even know the jacket is there?
Well, I don't.
I'm guessing.
Okay, look, Audrey, before you take the bandage off just remember, I was the one that encouraged you to do this.
Now that you're gonna be a great beauty, let's not forget how this began.
-lf you listened to your friend Elaine-- -George.
-Yeah?
-Enough.
-Right, enough.
-Are we ready?
Come on, let's get this show on the road.
-You sure you want us here for this?
-Yes.
-Shouldn't a doctor do it?
-No, he said I could do it.
Okay, here goes.
This is very exciting.
Very exciting.
It's like watching a birth.
It looks good.
-Great job.
-You got butchered.
Head hurt.
No, I'm good.
I'm fine.
Let's put him over here.
-Where are you going?
-To that doctor.
Wait, wait, wait!
I'll go with you.
How you feeling?
Too much salt in my diet.
-Can I get you anything?
-I'm good.
You sure?
Anything.
No.
Boy, it really didn't come out too well, did it?
No, it didn't.
No, it didn't.
It's, like, all dented.
Seems to be.
Well, I'm sure they'll be able to fix it.
You can't stop modern science.
Can't stop it.
Can't stop science.
Can't be stopped.
No way, no how.
Science just marches-- Shut up, George.
-Shut up?
-Yeah.
Interesting.
Come on, Kramer.
Seriously, give me her number!
-I threw it out.
-You're lying.
-You've got it.
I want the number.
-I threw it out.
-Give it to me.
-You said not to.
-You made me promise.
-I changed my mind.
I want it.
You said no matter what, I'm not to give it to you.
-I was lying.
Give it to me.
-You told me not to.
-I want the number!
-All right!
You want it?
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah.
Yeah, look at you.
Look at what you've sunk to.
Look at what you've become.
Look in the mirror, because you need help, Jerry.
You need help.
Because I can't stand by and do it anymore.
It's turning my stomach.
I can't stand around here watching you destroy yourself!
It's eating me up inside!
The doctor said they need to build the lateral wall of the septum.
Over here.
Yeah.
-You see this paranasal sinus cavity?
-Oh, I got it.
See how it's collapsed?
That's what's causing this huge dent.
Yeah.
Rough, rough.
So anyway, you know what I was thinking about?
What?
Remember we talked about taking a trip together?
-We did?
-We talked about going to Hawaii.
-Hawaii?
-Anyway, I think it would be great to get away after all this.
Well, you-- You know, Hawaii could be a little tricky now.
There's high-pressure winds down there this time of year.
There's a lot of debris constantly flying around, a lot of wood and lava.
It could be dangerous.
-I never heard that.
-Oh, yeah.
My friend lived there, so.
We could go to the Caribbean.
I have to tell you something.
You couldn't get me on a plane now.
I get those FAA reports directly.
My uncle sends them to me.
He used to be a pilot, so.
Big investigation in the.
What's the word there?
Offing.
It's in the offing.
But you shouldn't let that stop you from going.
You could go.
I don't mind.
-George?
-Yeah.
I don't think this is working.
Ever since you came back from the Army, you've changed.
I swear, Nelson, I don't even know who you are anymore.
I'm Nelson.
-That's not the line, Jerry.
-All right, all right, I'm sorry.
Nothing's changed, Elma.
I just need more time.
I swear, Nelson, sometimes at night when you're not around I just go crazy thinking about you.
Well, you just need to relax.
Maybe a hobby.
Bowling is fun.
Yeah, bowling's good, if you're really gross and ugly.
Uh-oh.
My organs are playing chess again.
I'm getting tired of this.
What do you say we play one for all the marbles?
Oh, brain, what are you doing?
You cannot beat me.
Do you have any idea who you're dealing with?
Forget about it.
I can't take her anymore.
-I hate reading her little acting scenes.
-Oh, so what?
So you read from a little play.
You can't put up with that for an hour to make me happy?
You're so selfish.
Give me one hour.
Then I will take over.
You won't have to think for the rest of the night.
What about tomorrow morning?
Do you have any idea what that's like for me?
Do you care?
No, you don't care.
So long as you get to do whatever it is you do.
-You disgust me.
-Oh, go read a book.
Enough chatter.
Let's play.
I'm only doing this because you took Audrey to the hospital.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay, now, you're clear?
You got everything?
-Yeah.
-Wait, wait, wait.
Here.
-What do I need this for?
-Because we're engaged.
We're engaged?
Kramer, this is too big.
-It's my mom's.
-Hello!
Oh, hi.
I'm Wanda Pepper.
I'm Albert Pepper's daughter.
My father asked me to pick up his jacket for him.
Hello, Miss Pepper.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
And you must be Professor Von Nostrand.
Yes.
Yes, I am.
I've read your book, professor, and I was quite intrigued by it.
-Yes, well, it's very intriguing.
-Tell me is it your contention that Shakespeare was an impostor?
-My contention?
-Your contention.
-Well, yes, that's my contention.
-I heard him contend that.
It's too bad about your father.
-lt was a frame-up.
-A fine man.
He spoke often of you.
He's very proud of the work you're doing.
-We're all proud of the work I'm doing.
-Yes, she does fine work.
Your father gave me strict orders not to turn the jacket over to anyone but I suppose I can make an exception in your case.
-The closet's this way.
-How kind of you.
You know, your father has a very extensive wardrobe.
Yes.
What's the matter, fella?
You look a little tired.
Nelson, don't you see?
You are a part of me.
And l. I am a part of you.
She's killing me.
That's your move?
-Yeah.
-Well, that's trouble, my friend.
That's big trouble.
Checkmate.
Getting weak.
Losing power.
You haven't seen the last of me.
I'll be back.
You're nothing without me.
Nothing.
Little punk.
Isabel, I don't think this is working.
Daddy certainly does have an extensive wardrobe.
He is a fine dresser.
I don't have to tell you he's quite popular with the ladies.
My father?
Really?
I had no idea.
They're crazy about him.
One in particular came around about two years ago.
Looked a lot like you, professor.
Could have been your mother.
What was her name again?
Carter?
Kramer.
That's it.
Babs Kramer.
Nasty woman.
Many a night I had to throw her on the street -drunken stumblebum.
-You don't say.
-I found it!
-She walked around here half-naked sucking Colt 45 from a can.
Her big, fat stomach hanging out, orthopaedic hose up to her knees screaming down the hall: "Come back to bed, Albert, you big hairy ape!
And bring back that box of Danish"!
-So I grabbed the guy by the collar.
-Yeah, and I yelled out: "Kramer, Kramer, you're killing him".
-So I assume the jig was up.
-Yeah, pretty much.
But look.
Yes.
-Hi.
Here are your keys.
-Hi.
Thank you.
-Hello.
-Audrey.
My God, you look incredible.
I can't believe it.
Well, it was his doctor.
He was wonderful.
So will I see you later tonight?
Not sure.
Well, I'll check you guys out later.
-Ready?
-I didn't wash.
Neither did l. We're off to the reggae lounge.
My nose, my nose.
My kingdom for a nose.
Isn't she beautiful?
Her nose is in such perfect proportions to the rest of her face.
She's breathtaking.
-Who would have thought, she's--?
-Elaine shut up.
The technical term for a nose job is?
-Rhinoplasty.
-Rhinoplasty.
Rhino.
Okay?
Do we really need to insult the person at this moment of their lives?
They know they have a big nose.
That's why they're coming in.
Do they really need the abuse of being compared to a rhinoceros on top of everything else?
When someone has a hair transplant, they don't go: "We're going to perform a cue ball-ectomy on you, Mr. Johnson.
We're going to attempt to remove the skinheadia of your chromedomus, which is what we-- The technical term".

{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
So I was in the drugstore trying to get a cold medication.
You ever try this?
It's an entire wall of medications.
"All right, all right, okay.
What the hell am l?
This is quick-acting, but this is long-lasting.
When do I need to feel good?
Now or later"?
It's a tough question.
Then the commercials on TV show you what's wrong with the guy.
They always show you the problems.
They show you the human body which is usually this guy: No face, mouth open.
This is how drug companies see the public.
And he's always in, like, a certain pain.
Like, red, wavy lines are going through him or he's glowing.
Parts of him are on fire sometimes.
Lightning is attacking him.
I never had a doctor say, "Are you having pain?
Are you having any lightning with the pain"?
How did you get fleas?
My cousin's imbecile dog was outside and they got in his carpet.
Maybe you could get yourself a little bow tie flea collar.
That's real funny.
So are you coming to the party?
I'd go, but Long lsland, it's so far out.
It smacks of desperation.
Everyone's gonna be saying: "You came all the way out from Manhattan for this"?
-You know, Ava's gonna be there.
-Who?
The nice one that works in my office.
-I'll drive!
-Oh, well, now you're talking.
Supposed to be a good party.
Well, what does that mean?
Good dip?
No.
There'll be girls there.
There's girls everywhere!
I go out and there's girls in the elevator.
They're in cafeterias, subways.
So what?
There's a hundred different things here.
What's the difference between these two?
-You got propylparaben?
-Got it.
You got isobutane 30?
I got isobutane 20.
You got sorbitan sesquioleate?
-Got it.
-I have aloe.
You got aloe?
I love aloe.
Where do they make yours?
-Jersey.
-White Plains.
Girls.
There's girls right here in the store.
Look.
Look.
There's one over there.
Look.
There's another one.
As soon as I walk outside, there'll be girls.
What's the matter?
I gave her a 20, she gave me change for a 10.
Are you sure?
Oh, boy.
Here we go.
Excuse me.
I gave you a $20 bill and you only gave me change for a 10.
-You gave me a 10.
-I'm positive I gave you a 20.
I know what you gave me.
You owe me $10.
Will you please step aside?
-Next!
-All right, all right.
Let's just examine the situation for a second.
Who, in this situation, would be more likely to make a mistake?
Me, who had access to my wallet, knew exactly what was in there -or you?
-You.
No, no, no.
See, you're not really listening.
-What's the problem here?
-There's no problem.
She just owes me $10.
That's all.
-He's claiming short.
-Let's just take it outside.
Oh, so you don't believe me either?
!
-Come on.
Let's go.
-All right.
You haven't won.
You may think you've won, but you haven't won.
Know why?
It's not over.
This is not over.
I'm not forgetting what's happening here.
You have my $10.
I will get it back.
All right.
Don't worry.
And it's not over.
I'm going now.
Goodbye.
I will be back.
Well, don't stand here.
Let's walk in.
Blend in.
Blend in.
No, let's survey first.
Camp here.
Ava.
What could possess anyone to throw a party?
I mean, to have a bunch of strangers treat your house like a hotel room.
-Guess who just sold 129 West 81st.
-Oh, no, you didn't.
-Get out!
When?
-Yesterday.
-I don't believe it.
-Ask Mark.
Mark, is this true?
Yeah, this has got "disaster" written all over it.
How did I let you talk me into this?
I must have been out of my mind.
Listen, let's keep an eye on each other.
In case one of us gets in a bad conversation we should have a signal so the other one can get us out of it.
-How old are you?
-Thirty-six.
What's the signal?
How about this: chicken wing.
No, no, no.
I got a better one: Head-patting.
Whatever you want.
You came all the way out from Manhattan for this?
Yeah.
Yeah, I did.
So, what do you do?
-I'm a comedian.
-Are you?
Let me ask you something.
Where do you get your material?
-I hear a voice.
-What kind of voice?
A man's voice.
But he speaks in German, so I have to get it translated.
How come you keep tapping your head?
It's a nervous tick.
I'm on L-dopa.
On the other hand, you take a guy like George Washington Carver.
The man devoted his whole life to the peanut.
Imagine having so much passion for something.
You know, people tell me I'm a funny guy.
I've often wondered if he ever worked with the pecan.
Yeah.
Me too.
Now, is that considered a nut?
I know the cashew is a legume.
-How's it going?
-Great.
How about you?
I can't believe what's happening here.
She hasn't taken her hands off me all night.
She was always friendly around the office, but that was it.
-How do you account for this?
-I don't know.
Maybe a safe fell on her head.
Well, she obviously liked you all along.
No.
I would have picked up on it.
I can always tell.
Women always somehow let you know.
With me, they could torture me, I wouldn't tell them.
I try to make them think I don't like them.
Then they think, "Oh, this guy's not even looking.
He must have something going for him".
Anyway, I'm ready to go.
-Now?
-Well, if not now, when?
-Give me a half-hour.
-Okay.
Half-hour.
Peanut brittle, peanut butter, peanut oil.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Oh, excuse me.
What have you been doing?
I've been smacking myself senseless.
People think I'm a mental patient.
Hey, I was dying over there.
This guy's going off on the peanut.
Now, pay attention.
Yeah, I think I've seen you in a club.
-You talk about everyday things, right?
-Right.
Yeah.
I remember you.
I wonder what happened to my fiancé.
I know he's here somewhere.
Ellen, have you seen my fiancé?
-He's upstairs.
-Are you going upstairs?
Tell my fiancé I'm looking for him.
I have lost my fiancé, the poor baby.
Maybe the dingo ate your baby.
What?
The dingo ate your baby.
You ready?
Listen, l have a tremendous favour to ask.
I do favours.
-I think something's happening here.
-What?
I think she wants me to take her home.
-What should I do?
-Go.
What can you do?
-What about you and Elaine?
-We'll get a ride.
-You're sure?
-We'll be fine.
What did she say?
She told me she-- She told me she wants me to make love to her.
-What?
She said that?
-Yeah.
-Get out of here.
-I swear.
-What did you say?
-l.
-Oh, I can't.
-Come on.
What did you say?
-Please, it's, it's.
-What?
"l".
"l".
"l long for you".
-"l long for you"?
-I was so shocked -I was lucky I said anything.
-It's okay.
That's not bad.
I don't like when a woman says "Make love to me".
It's intimidating.
The last time a woman said that to me, I wound up apologizing to her.
-Really?
-That's a lot of pressure.
"Make love to me".
What am l, in the circus?
-What if I can't deliver?
-Oh, come on.
I can't perform under pressure.
That's why I never play anything for money.
I choke.
I could choke tonight.
And she works in my office.
Can you imagine?
If she goes around telling everyone what happened.
Maybe I should cancel.
I have a very bad feeling about this.
-George, you're thinking too much.
-I know, I know.
I can't stop it.
Well, right now I'm reading manuscripts for Pendant Publishing.
Pendant?
Those bastards.
Excuse me.
Listen, George is going home with this Ava from his office.
Really?
What a world.
-So we can go now.
-No, he's taking the car.
-What are we gonna do for a ride?
-I don't know.
-You don't know?
-Maybe Kramer can come pick us up.
Great.
Oh, this is great.
How could you let him take the car?
There's nothing I could do.
It's part of the code.
All plans between men are tentative.
If one man should suddenly have an opportunity to pursue a woman it's like these two guys never met each other ever in life.
This is the male code.
And it doesn't matter how important the arrangements are.
Most of the time, they screw up a space shuttle mission, it's because one of the astronauts met someone on his way to the launch pad.
They hold that countdown.
He's leaning against the rocket: "So when I get back, what do you say we get together for some Tang"?
Oh, look at what she's wearing.
You see what she's wearing?
Yeah, yeah, all right.
I can't believe she's walking around in that.
-Just don't make a scene.
-Hey, is that real fur?
-Oh, boy.
-lt better be.
Or my ex-husband owes me an explanation.
Good night.
You don't care that innocent, defenceless animals are tortured so you look good?
Could we talk about this some other time?
-Are you a vegetarian?
-Here we go.
Yeah.
I eat fish occasionally.
-So you're a hypocrite.
-Hey!
I've eaten frogs, so nobody's perfect.
Anyway.
-Talk to me when you stop eating fish.
-Fish don't feel any pain.
How do you know?
Do you communicate with fish?
Well, they're not kept in little cages.
-Ever seen a goldfish?
-Goldfish!
Yeah.
Yeah, I've seen goldfish.
They're not unhappy.
Right.
Swim around a bowl for two weeks and get flushed down the toilet.
That's a good life.
Oh, yeah.
That's right.
Go ahead.
Go ahead.
Maybe you can run over a squirrel!
Yeah, well, that's why we're here in America.
-You're beautiful.
-Call Kramer.
All right.
Excuse me.
This is your party, right?
-No.
I just live here.
-Can I use your phone?
What's in it for me?
-A bigger bill.
-Go for it.
Kram, Sein.
What are you doing?
Well, I'm stuck out here on Long lsland.
What are your thoughts about taking a ride?
You're sure?
Okay, but don't leave me hanging here.
Okay, great.
Let me give you directions.
You sure you don't need any help?
No, not really.
I'm sure he'll be here any minute.
I want them out of here.
-Call him again.
-I called.
What should I do?
We really appreciate this.
It's 2:00 in the morning.
Oh, you got the Civil War book.
I saw some of that show.
It was wonderful.
Thousand.
Thousand!
620,000.
The horror.
The horror!
The wife keeps giving us dirty looks.
Are you sure you gave him the right directions?
-You sure there's nothing we can do?
-No!
I am not going to bed with them in our house.
This is ridiculous.
You know, a friend of my father's used to live right around here.
Mike Wichter.
He sold plastic straws.
You know the ones?
You could bend them.
Have you noticed?
People don't use straws as much as they used to.
You know, it doesn't look as if your friend is coming.
Oh, he's coming.
Maybe you should take a look at a train schedule.
That's him.
I'm going to bed!
-Thanks a lot.
-Thanks.
Great party.
-Hey, how you doing?
-Look who's here.
-I'm sorry.
-Hey, it's okay.
I had the directions on the seat right next to me.
They flew out the window.
Then how did you find the place?
Well, I knew the exit on the Long lsland Expressway and I thought that the address was 8713 Riviera Drive.
So I drove around knocking on everybody's doors that had those numbers.
Finally, I hit it.
8173.
Anyway, thanks a lot for letting us stay here, Steve.
I really owe you one.
No problem.
And if you're ever in the city you wanna come to a comedy club, whatever.
Hey, I might take you up on that.
Here's my address and number.
And, really, thanks again.
Well, you better zip up.
I couldn't get the top on the convertible up.
-But it's cold out.
-Wait till we get on the Expressway.
George, I've been sick all week.
Elaine was too.
Eighty miles an hour, 40 degree temperature for 50 minutes.
Do the math.
Yeah, maybe I will get out.
But let me just stop off at the drugstore first.
Meet me down there in 15 minutes, then we'll go do something.
Yeah, Selwyn's.
Okay, bye.
-Who is it?
-Mr. Pocatillo!
-Who?
-You don't recognize my voice?
-Jerry, baby!
-Do I know you?
-Boy, this comedy's frying your brain.
-I'm sorry.
See, this is the kind of lasting impression I make on people.
-Oh, okay.
-You said if I was ever in the city.
I'm in the city!
You certainly are.
What's going on?
I'm just waiting for a lift back.
He won't be ready until 1 1.
I figured I'd give you a break see what it's like to hang out with someone in show business.
Listen, I'm really sorry, but I'm just on my way out to meet a friend.
Oh, come on.
You can come up with something better than that.
No, really, I just got off the phone with him.
I understand.
Look, you can hang out here if you want.
Don't be so enthusiastic.
-No, it's.
-I'm not gonna steal anything.
No, of course not.
Just close the door when you leave.
-I think I can do that.
-Really, I'm sorry.
Maybe another time.
Yeah.
Let's have lunch.
The guy's in my house right now.
What a mistake that party was.
I never should've gone.
-Yeah, me either.
-Oh, come on.
What "come on"?
Have you ever dated a woman that worked in your office?
-I never had a job.
-Know that anxiety you feel on a date?
That's what I have every day now.
My worst nightmare's come true.
Every day is a date.
That's one of Dante's nine stages of hell, isn't it?
Ava was one of the reasons I used to like work.
She was a friend.
Now we sleep together and suddenly I don't know how to talk to her.
Every time I go to the bathroom, I pass her desk.
I have to plan little patter.
I spend half my day writing.
Then afterwards I sit in my office and analyse how it went.
If it was a good conversation, I don't go to the bathroom the rest of the day.
I see her laughing and talking with other people.
They're all so loose and relaxed.
I think: "That used to be me.
I wanna go back there again".
-What are you gonna do?
-I have no choice.
I'm quitting.
The party, Long lsland.
-Kramer, right?
-Yeah.
-Hey, what are you doing here?
-Waiting for my ride.
-Where's Jerry?
-He split.
Let me ask you something.
Is there anything to drink in here?
Or is that a stupid question?
Jerry, he doesn't have anything.
But I might have something.
I'm gonna get this.
This looks good.
-How much is that?
-$9.60.
$9.60?
Give it to me.
-Why?
-Don't worry, I got it.
-What do you mean, you got it?
-I got it.
Since when are you treating me to medicine?
What are you doing?
-You're stealing this, aren't you?
-I'm not stealing.
They owe me $10.
-They stole from me.
-You're a lunatic.
I have to.
It's a matter of honour.
What do you say to a person like you?
Just walk.
You don't even know me.
Excuse me.
What do you got there?
-What?
-What do you got in your shirt?
-I was gonna pay for this.
-Come with me.
Where are you taking me?
I was gonna pay for it.
-Don't think I remember you?
-What are you talking about?
I know who you are!
I was watching you.
What are you gonna do?
You gonna call the police?
-Come on!
-Where--!
Can I still buy this or is this evidence now?
So I'm chasing these doves down the street and she's screaming at the top of her lungs and then when the magician comes back from Europe two of them turn brown!
Well, I followed the instructions!
They turned brown!
-Brown!
-Brown!
So let me ask you something.
You know any women we could call?
Not really.
Maybe we should call one of those escort services.
Yeah.
I saw one of them advertised before on the cable station.
-Are you in on this?
-Oh, no, no.
I got a girl in the next building.
Now, I want my money, mister!
And I ain't leaving till I get it.
Now, I am through playing games with you.
I got things to do.
Oh, Jerry, Jerry.
Look who's here.
It's Jerry.
What the hell--?
-Jerry, this is Patti.
-Nice to meet you.
A pleasure to make your acquaintance.
What the hell is going on here?
I don't know, but I gotta do this more often.
There's my ride, finally.
I'm not gonna go anywhere until I get the rest of my money.
See you, Jer, and tell Kramer thanks.
I'll call him tomorrow.
Oh, Kramer.
Yeah, he's a hoot.
Goodbye, my dear.
Weekend of the 26th, come on out.
We're having another party.
I ain't leaving.
-Patti.
-You got anything to drink?
-All right, how much does he owe you?
-$50.
Fifty dollars.
-ls this your apartment?
-Yeah, but-- -You're under arrest for solicitation.
-Oh, wait a second.
I. I have chicken soup.
Is that real fur?
-Oh, boy.
-Oh, boy.
You had Sergeant Chadway?
Me too.
-He was a nice guy.
-Oh, great guy.
Was there a redheaded guy there?
-The one with the long sideburns?
-Yeah!
-Where does he come off?
-I know.
There's no call for that kind of attitude.
One of the guys in my cell threw a piece of gum at him.
We all hated him.
There's two types of favours: big favour, small favour.
You can measure the size of the favour by the pause that a person takes after they ask you to "do me a favour".
Small favour, small pause: "Do me a favour?
Hand me that pencil".
No pause at all.
Big favours are: "Could you do me a favour"?

{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
It seems the way they design the car alarms is so that the car will behave as if it was a nervous, hysterical person.
Anyone goes near it, anyone disturbs it, it's: Lights flashing on and off, acting all crazy.
Not everyone wants to draw that much attention to themselves.
Wouldn't it be nice to have a car alarm that was more subtle?
Maybe just, you know, somebody tries to break in, and it goes: "Excuse me"?
I would like a car alarm like that.
Do you believe this?
Car was parked right out front.
-Was the alarm on?
-I don't know.
I guess it was on.
I don't know my alarm sound.
I'm not tuned into it like it's my son.
I don't understand.
How do these thieves start the car?
-They cross the wires or something.
-Cross the wires?
I can't even make a pot of spaghetti.
-Hey.
-They stole my car.
-Who did?
-They did.
Was it more than just one?
What should I do?
Call the police?
What are they gonna do?
You know, I'd better call the car-phone company, cancel my service.
Maybe you should call your car phone.
Yeah.
He's probably driving it right now.
Wait a minute.
Call the car phone.
See what happens.
-Are you serious?
-Yeah, go ahead.
Call.
I don't even know if l remember the number.
What do I say if he picks up?
-Hello.
-Hello.
-ls this 555-8383?
-I have no idea.
-Can I ask you a question?
-Sure.
-Did you steal my car?
-Yes, I did.
-You did?
-I did.
-But that's my car.
-I didn't know it was yours.
-What are you gonna do with it?
-I don't know.
Drive around.
-Then can I have it back?
-No, I'm gonna keep it.
Let me talk to him.
Give it, give it, give it.
-Hello.
-Yeah, who's this?
-Kramer.
-Hello, Kramer.
Listen, there's a pair of gloves in the glove compartment.
Wait, hold it.
-Brown ones?
-Yeah.
Could you mail those to me?
Or bring them by my building.
-It's 129 West 81st Street.
-129.
Okay.
All right, thanks a lot.
Here's Jerry.
Gloves.
-Hello.
-Jerry.
Yeah.
Let me ask you a question.
How do you cross those wires?
I didn't cross any wires.
The keys were in it.
Sid left the keys in the car.
All right, I gotta go.
Drive carefully.
Hey, Jerry, when's the last time you had a tune-up?
Because I can't find-- -Sid left the keys in the car.
-Who's Sid?
Guy in the neighbourhood.
He parks cars on the block.
-What do you mean?
-He moves them from side to side -so you don't get a ticket.
-You pay him for that?
-Yeah.
Like 50 bucks a month.
-How many people does he do it for?
-The whole block, 40, 50 cars.
-He only works three hours a day.
He makes a fortune.
He's been doing that for years, right, Jerry?
Could anybody do that?
-Hey, Sid.
What happened?
-I'm sorry, Jerry.
Maybe I'm too old for this stuff.
You left the keys in the car?
Well, they're making that Woody Allen movie on the block and all those people and trucks everywhere and when I saw him, I must've been distracted.
-You know I'm in that movie.
-You're what?
-Yeah, I'm an extra.
-How'd you get that?
Well, I was just watching them film yesterday, and some guy asked me.
-Right out of the clear blue sky?
-Clear blue sky.
-Why didn't they ask me?
-I got a quality.
-Hey, Jerry, you got insurance, right?
-Yeah, but no car.
I'll have to rent one.
I'm going to visit my sister in Virginia next Wednesday for a week, so I can't park it.
-This Wednesday?
-No, next Wednesday.
Week after this Wednesday.
But the Wednesday two days from now is the next Wednesday.
If I meant this Wednesday, I would've said this Wednesday.
It's the week after this Wednesday.
Sid, who's gonna move the cars while you're away?
Whoever wants to move them.
What do I care who moves them?
They can move themselves if they want.
Maybe I could move them until you get back.
What's a young man like you want to move cars for?
You don't work?
I'm in a transition phase right now.
Well, if you want to move the cars, move the cars.
-Just don't forget to take the keys out.
-All right.
Hello.
Yeah, the defroster's the one on the bottom.
Just slide it all the way over.
You're welcome.
I'm in awe of his intellect.
When he talks, it sounds like -he's reading from one of his novels.
-Owen March.
I never heard of him.
-Well, he's not a baseball player.
-Yeah, that's true.
-lt sounds like it's going pretty good.
-Yeah.
Well, there is one little problem.
-What's that?
-He's 66 years old.
Next, please.
Go.
Go.
She-- Go.
Come on.
Can I help you?
Name, please.
Seinfeld.
I made a reservation for a midsize, and she's a small.
-I'm kidding around, of course.
-Yes.
Okay, let's see here.
-Sixty-six years old?
-Yeah, well, he's in perfect health.
He works out.
He's vibrant.
You'd really like him.
Why do people always say that?
I hate everybody.
Why would I like him?
Could you go out with a 66-year-old woman?
Well, I'll tell you, she would have to be really vibrant.
So vibrant she'd be spinning.
I'm sorry.
We have no midsize available at the moment.
I made a reservation.
Do you have my reservation?
Yes, we do.
Unfortunately, we ran out of cars.
But the reservation keeps the car here.
That's why you have the reservation.
-I know why we have reservations.
-I don't think you do.
If you did, I'd have a car.
See, you know how to take the reservation.
You just don't know how to hold the reservation.
And that's really the most important part of the reservation, the holding.
Anybody can just take them.
Let me speak with my supervisor.
Well, here we go.
The supervisor.
-Know what she's saying over there?
-What?
"Hey, Marge, see those two people?
They think I'm talking to you.
So you pretend like you're talking to me.
Okay, now you start talking".
"You mean like this?
So it looks like I'm saying something, but I'm not".
"Say something else, and they won't yell at me because they thought I was checking with you".
"Okay, I think that's enough.
See you later".
I'm sorry.
My supervisor says there's nothing we can do.
Yeah, it looked like you were in a real conversation over there.
Well, we do have a compact if you would like that.
-Fine.
-All right.
Well, we have a blue Ford Escort for you, Mr. Seinfeld.
-Would you like insurance?
-Yeah, give me the insurance because I am gonna beat the hell out of this thing.
Please fill this out.
Do you think I'm making a big mistake?
If you enjoy being with him, that's what's important.
I love being with him.
I mean, I like being with him.
It's okay being with him.
-I just don't enjoy being with him.
-Well, that's what important.
I'm meeting him for lunch at Chadway's.
Do I have to break up face to face, or can I just do it over the phone?
-How many times have you been out?
-Seven.
Face to face.
Seven dates is a face-to-face breakup?
If it was six, I could've let you go.
But seven, I'm afraid, is over the limit.
Unless, of course, there was no sex.
How's the pasta over there?
What is going on out there?
I need a bucket of water.
I got a car overheating.
I got an alarm that won't go off.
I'm pressing one.
I'm pressing two.
Nothing.
What do I do?
Help me.
Help me.
They were supposed to do my scene today.
-Today?
-Yeah.
They said they wanted me to walk down the block carrying this bag of groceries.
So I start to walk, and I trip.
And the grocery bag goes flying -and Woody starts laughing.
-He was laughing?
Oh, yeah.
He was drinking something.
It started to come out of his nose.
-So then what?
-Well, I got a line in the movie!
-Get out!
-That's great.
You got a line in a Woody Allen movie?
-Pretty good, huh?
-You're in the movie?
-ls he in the scene?
-Yeah, it's me and him.
I might have a new career on my hands, huh?
You mean "a career".
-So was Mia Farrow there?
-I didn't see him.
-What's your line?
-Well, okay, I'm there with Woody you know.
I'm at this bar, and, you know, it's Woody Allen.
-Did I mention that?
-We got it.
We got it.
And I'm sitting there with Woody, and I turn to him and I go: Boy, these pretzels are making me thirsty.
-ls that how you're gonna say it?
-No, no.
I'm working on it.
Do it like this.
-These pretzels are making me thirsty.
-No.
-These pretzels are making me thirsty.
-No, no.
See, that's no good.
You don't know how to act.
These pretzels are making me thirsty!
-That was no good?
-I didn't say anything.
All right, I'm gonna go break up with Owen.
What was wrong with that?
I had a different interpretation.
Do you know anything about this pretzel guy?
Maybe he's been in the bar a long time and he's really depressed because he has no job, and no woman and he's parking cars for a living!
All right!
All right!
Shut up!
Shut up!
I hear you!
I'm coming down!
These pretzels are making me thirsty!
Yeah!
Oh, my God.
Call an ambulance.
Boy, he took it hard.
We were walking down the block I was about to break up with him, then he started to twitch.
Yes, I need an ambulance at 129 West 81st Street, Apartment 5A.
-Tell them to hurry.
Hurry!
-It's an ambulance.
I don't know, but he's unconscious.
These pretzels are making me thirsty.
These pretzels are making me thirsty.
-Kramer.
-What happened here?
I don't know.
What should we do?
We called an ambulance.
-Anyone know first aid?
-Do something with the extremities.
-What extremities?
-What's an extremity?
You raise the feet, get blood to the head.
You raise the head, get blood to the feet.
Okay, what about a cold compress?
They always do that.
-I don't have a washcloth.
-Use a paper towel.
-You can't put that on his head.
-What about a big sponge?
-How you gonna hold it on there?
-Use a belt.
No, no, no.
That'll-- lt'll drip all over him.
-Should we walk him around?
-I've seen them do that.
-That's for a drug overdose.
-Maybe that's what he's got.
No, I just had lunch with him.
He didn't leave the table.
Well, he could've dropped acid when you weren't looking.
He is not a drug addict.
Maybe he's diabetic.
He might just need a cookie or something.
-A cookie!
-Can you give him a cookie?
-How's he gonna chew it?
-Move his teeth.
Worked for my uncle.
The sugar revived him.
Careful, you're getting crumbs all over him.
I've got him chewing, but I don't think he's gonna swallow.
Let's put a few cookies in a blender and he could drink it.
-Cookies don't liquefy.
-They do.
You can liquefy a cookie.
-I'll get the blender.
-I don't have a blender.
-You've got a blender.
-I'd know if I had a blender.
Where is the ambulance?
!
Hello, yes.
I called for an ambulance like 35 minutes ago.
I can't believe what's going on out here.
This is an emergency.
What's taking so long?
Wait a second.
Maybe that's them.
-Hello.
-Paramedics.
Come on up.
Okay, they're here.
He seems to be breathing.
You know, I've got to tell you, he's a pretty good-looking guy.
I know.
Those eyebrows could use a trimming.
You ever mention that?
Almost.
I mean, because, come on, they're running wild there.
-It's not an easy thing to bring up.
-Yeah, that's true.
You should see his bathrobe, man.
It's all silk.
Yeah.
Does he wear slippers.
I bet he wears slippers.
-He does.
How'd you know that?
-I could tell.
What happened?
What took you so long?
We got here 20 minutes ago, but we couldn't move.
The intersection is gridlocked.
I've never seen anything like it.
Finally we make the turn, and this guy who was triple-parking cars -slammed into us with a blue Escort.
-Blue Escort?
-That's my rent-a-car!
-Oh, man.
What happened to the car?
I'm sorry.
You don't know what's going on out there!
Who's he?
-This guy I'm seeing.
-What happened?
-We don't know.
-Who put cookies in his mouth?
-Cookies?
-You're not supposed to do that.
-So how'd you hit the car?
-I was moving it across the street.
I looked up and I saw Woody Allen.
I got all distracted.
-It's not even my car.
It's a rental.
-What are you doing out there?
You're holding up the production of the movie.
We can't shoot, and Woody, he's really mad at you.
Woody mentioned me?
What did he say?
He said, "Who's the moron who's got the street all screwed up"?
Should I apologize to Woody?
All right, I'll tell you what.
Next time I talk to him, maybe I'll bring it up.
I'll feel him out.
What do you think first aid was like hundreds of years ago?
I mean, they had no medicine, no drugs no technology, no equipment.
Basically, they were there first.
That was it.
That was the whole first aid.
They sit with you.
That's all they could do.
"Can you help me"?
"No, we can't help you, but we were the first ones here.
Did you see our truck?
'First aid.
' That's our motto.
We show up before anybody".
You didn't say you didn't know how to drive.
-Should've mentioned that.
-Well, I know how to drive.
Then how did all those cars get damaged?
Why are people calling me up, screaming on the phone?
-Most of them cancelled out on me.
-Can I get anybody anything?
Moving cars from one side to the other don't take no more sense than putting on a pair of pants.
My question to you is: Who's putting your pants on?
-I put my pants on, Sid.
-I don't believe you.
You can put your pants on, you can move cars.
I don't want to get into a big dispute about the pants.
Who's gonna send money to my sister in Virginia?
Her little boy needs surgery on his foot.
He'll be walking around with a limp, because you can't park a few cars.
Maybe I could call my father.
-Hey, you seen the paper yet?
-lnterestingly enough, no inasmuch as it is my paper.
There's an article on that writer.
"Owen March, prominent author and essayist, suffered a stroke yesterday in the Upper West Side apartment of a friend".
That's the guy that was here.
You're the friend.
Thanks.
"The extent of the damage would've been far less severe had paramedics been able to reach him sooner".
-Oh, Lord.
-"The commotion also delayed production of a Woody Allen movie that was shooting up the block.
A spokeswoman for the legendary filmmaker said that Mr. Allen was extremely agitated and wondered if his days of shooting movies in New York were over".
Five seconds.
Jerry, I was five seconds away from breaking up with him.
Five seconds!
The next words out of my mouth were, "Owen, it's over".
-Can he communicate?
-Yeah.
Well, he nods.
And I think he understands me.
He seems to enjoy it when I read to him.
All right, she's free.
Hi, I called before.
My car got smashed.
So listen.
What should I do?
If I break up with him now it'll look like I'm abandoning him.
I'll be ostracized from the community.
What community?
There's a community?
Of course there's a community.
All these years, I'm living in a community, I had no idea.
Sir, the estimate on the damage to your car is $2866.
-I got the insurance and everything-- -Yes, now, in your report you said you weren't the driver at the time of the accident.
Somebody else was driving it.
All right, well, sir, you're only covered for when you're driving the car.
What's that?
-You're not covered for other drivers.
-Other drivers?
Your whole business is based on other drivers.
It's a rented car.
That's who's driving it.
Other drivers.
Doesn't my credit card cover me?
-Not that particular one.
-I got a hundred cards.
Here, here.
Pick a card.
Take any card you want.
Go ahead.
Whichever one.
I don't care.
-lf you had read the rental agreement-- -Did you see the size of that document?
It's like the Declaration of lndependence.
Who's gonna read that?
Mr. Seinfeld, as it stands right now, you are not covered for that damage and there is absolutely nothing that can be done about that.
These pretzels are making me thirsty.
It's good, isn't it?
Yankee bean.
Why Yankee bean, huh?
Don't they have beans in the South?
I mean, if you order Yankee bean in the South, are they offended?
Yankee bean.
Yankee bean.
I like my Yankee bean.
Owen I think we have to talk.
I mean, I have to talk.
It would be nice if we could, but, you know, whatever.
Don't get me wrong.
I like coming here and feeding you and cleaning a little, and paying your bills.
I mean, that's good stuff.
Good stuff.
I have a wonderful time when I'm with you.
Wonderful!
But at this point in my life, I'm not really sure that I'm ready to make a commitment to one person.
I'm just not really sure that we have enough in common.
I mean, for example: I like running in the park bicycling roller-skating, tennis and skiing.
And, well.
I'm gonna be brutally honest with you now.
It's a bitch to get here.
It's two subways.
I have to transfer at 42nd Street to take the double-R.
Anyway, I mean, this doesn't mean we can't be friends.
These pretzels are making me thirsty.
Can you die from an odour?
I mean, if you were locked in a vomitorium for two weeks -could you die from the odour?
-An overdose of odour.
Good question.
Do I smell?
No, no, no.
I was just down at the 42nd Street subway today.
It is disgusting.
Guess who I bumped into?
Owen.
-He's all right?
-Yeah, he's almost fully recovered.
Told me he was just using me for sex.
-Let me get that.
-I got it.
-Please.
-Let me.
I smashed your car.
It cost you over $2000.
Yeah, a cup of coffee should cover it.
-Oh, man.
-What are you doing here?
I got fired from the movie.
-Get out of here.
What?
-What?
Well, you know, they were going to shoot it today.
We rehearsed it twice, and then Woody yells, "Action".
I turn to him and I say: "These pretzels are making me thirsty".
-Right.
-Then I took a swig of beer and I slammed the glass down on the bar, and it shattered.
Well, one of the pieces must've hit Woody and he started crying.
And he yells out, "I'm bleeding," and he runs off.
Anyway, this woman, she came up to me, and she says, "You're fired".
Boy, I really nailed that scene.
Oh, wait a-- Oh, for crying out loud.
The best part of a relationship is when you're sick.
The best part of being sick is when you're in a relationship.
But if I got married, you know those vows for richer or for poorer, for better or for worse.
All I need is the sickness.
That is the most important one.
"Do you take this man in sickness"?
That's the time I need somebody there.
The rest of the time, go out, have a ball.
But if I get the sniffles, you better be there.

{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Every mall has a Hoffritz in it.
That's got to be a scary place to work.
I don't know how you feel.
Do you want to stand there having people going: "l need knives.
I need more knives.
Do you have any bigger knives?
I'd like a bigger knife.
A big, long, sharp knife.
That's what I'm in the market for.
I like them really sharp.
Do you have one with hooks and gouges and blades that are kind of serrated?
That's the kind of knife I'm looking for.
I need one I can throw.
I need one I can hack away with.
Do you have anything like that"?
Like you know what you're talking about.
Oh, no.
You do?
Well, what do you think, they put the statue on a giant raft and a tugboat pulled it all the way from France?
Think they brought it in pieces and screwed it together like a coffee table?
What's going on?
It's a little early for a Christmas party.
-Why'd France give that to us anyway?
-lt was a gift.
Countries just exchange gifts like that?
If they like each other.
-There's Elaine.
-See that guy she's talking with?
-That's her new boyfriend.
-Really?
He works here in the office?
They're having a little fling, so don't say anything to anyone.
Who am I gonna tell, my mother?
Like I have nothing better to talk about.
You don't.
He's a recovering alcoholic.
-Really?
-He's been off the wagon two years.
-"Off the wagon"?
-I think it's "off the wagon".
I think it's "on the wagon".
Jerry, George, what are you doing here?
What am I doing here?
My God!
My watch!
You found my watch.
Keep your hands to yourself if you know what's good for you.
-Where'd you find it?
-Under the sofa cushion.
-You stopped by just to give it to me?
-It's your Christmas present.
-I thought I'd never find it.
-Today's your lucky day.
No, today is your lucky day.
-lt would be my first one.
-You want to work here?
-What?
-Yeah.
One of the readers just left.
There's a job opening.
Dick, this is Jerry.
And this is George.
-Hi.
Nice to meet you.
-ls this the guy?
"The guy"?
-Dick.
-How can you just get it?
My boss said to find someone.
I'm in charge.
All you have to do is meet him.
Come on.
-No, come on.
Hold my drink.
-Cranberry juice?
And vodka.
Come on.
I got the cranberry juice.
So -you're Jerry.
-So I'm Jerry.
So have you ever done this kind of work before?
Well, you know, book reports, that kind of stuff.
-Who do you read?
-I like Mike Lupica.
Mike Lupica?
He's a sportswriter for the Daily News.
-I find him very insightful.
-No, I mean authors.
Well a lot of good ones.
Lot of good ones.
I don't even wanna mention anybody because I'm afraid I'm gonna leave somebody out.
-Name a couple.
-Who do I like?
I like Art Vandalay.
-Art Vandalay?
-He's an obscure writer.
Beatnik, you know, from the village.
What's he written?
Venetian Blinds.
I got news for you.
I'm funnier than you are.
Why don't we get together New Year's, watch some football?
-Where's my drink?
-There.
So how'd it go?
I think he's impressed.
No, no, this is just cranberry juice.
I think maybe Dick picked up yours.
Dick?
He can't drink.
He's an alcoholic.
I told you to hold it.
I didn't know you meant hold it.
I thought you meant hold it.
One drink like that, and he could fall right off the wagon.
Told you.
I never feel comfortable in the women's department.
I feel like I'm just a little too close to trying on a dress.
Do I really have to buy her something?
The woman got you a job.
Least you could do is buy her a gift.
How about this?
-What is that, cashmere?
-Yeah.
She loves cashmere.
Who doesn't like cashmere?
Find me one person that doesn't like cashmere.
It's too expensive.
Wow, look at this.
It's $85, marked down from 600.
-Excuse me, miss?
-Yes.
How come this sweater's only $85?
Oh, here.
This is why.
-What?
I don't see anything.
-See this red dot?
-Oh, yeah.
-Oh, it's damaged.
It's not really damaged.
Wow.
$85?
There's no exchanges on this.
-Think she'd care about the dot?
-It's hard to say.
I don't think she'd notice.
Can you see it?
-Well, I can see it.
-But you know where it is.
-What do you want me to do, not look?
-Pretend you didn't know it was there.
-Can you see it?
-It's hard to pretend -because I know where it is.
-Can't you take an overview?
You want me to take an overview?
I see a cheap man holding a sweater trying to get away with something.
That's my overview.
-Yeah, so?
-He's acting very strangely.
I think he started drinking again.
-Oh, boy.
Can you smell it?
-No, I can't smell it.
If you can't smell it, then he hasn't been drinking.
-You don't always smell from a drink.
-Yes, you do.
What about one drink?
Would you smell from one drink?
Yes, you would.
-I'll prove it.
-How?
-Would you do me a favour?
-Okay.
Would you take a drink, and let us smell you?
You can smell me without the drink.
No, no.
I suspect that this guy I'm seeing might be drinking, but I can't smell it.
-Come on.
-Okay.
Well, what am I drinking?
I got a bottle of Scotch my uncle gave me.
Hennigan's.
It's been there two years.
I've been using it as a paint thinner.
All right.
-I don't smell anything.
-We're too close to the bottle.
-Yeah?
-It's George.
-Come on up.
-That is damn good Scotch.
I could do a commercial for this stuff.
Boy, that Hennigan goes down smooth and afterwards, you don't even smell.
That's right, folks.
I just had three shots of Hennigan's, and I don't smell.
Imagine, you can walk around drunk all day.
That's Hennigan's, the no-smell, no-tell Scotch.
-Hello, everybody.
-Hey, George, come here.
I'm gonna tell you what I think.
I know you don't care what I think, but I'm gonna tell you.
I think that you are terrific.
That's all.
Thank you.
-Hey, what's that?
-It's an early Christmas present.
-A Christmas present?
-That's right.
-For who?
-For you.
Get out of here.
Say you got a big job interview and you're nervous.
Throw back a couple of shots of Hennigan's and you'll be as loose as a goose and ready to roll in no time.
And because it's odourless, why, it'll be our little secret.
Kramer.
Yeah.
That'll do.
Oh, George, this is beautiful.
Is this cashmere?
-Of course it's cashmere.
-Oh, I love cashmere.
-Who doesn't?
-Oh, my God.
George, this must have cost a fortune.
Money.
Jerry, how could you let him spend so much?
I tried to stop him.
I couldn't.
He just wants to make people happy.
George, this is one of the nicest things anyone has ever given me.
Good.
Good.
Listen, take it off.
You're gonna wear it out already.
It's for special occasions, this thing.
What's that red dot on your sweater?
-What?
-Listen, take it off.
I'm getting hot just looking at it.
What is this?
It's like a red dot.
What?
What red dot?
What are you talking about?
Jerry, come here for a second.
Do you see anything here?
I don't know.
I don't know.
-What don't you know?
-I don't know.
Well, do you see it, or don't you?
Say that again.
Do you see it, or don't you?
Do I see it or don't l?
That's the question.
Now, what did you ask me again?
You're still here?
You're a dynamo.
-I can't believe I get paid for this.
-God.
I'll see you tomorrow.
-How you doing?
-Hello.
You had sex with the cleaning woman on your desk?
Who are you?
How did you do that?
Hennigan's.
Hennigan's?
I was sitting there in the office, and the cleaning woman comes in.
I've always been attracted to cleaning women.
Cleaning women, chambermaids.
Yeah, chambermaids, I'm attracted to them too.
-Why is that?
-It's a woman in your room.
-So go ahead.
-So she starts vacuuming, back and forth, back and forth her hips swivelling her breasts.
Convulsing?
-Convulsing?
-I don't know.
I'm trying to help you.
So then I asked her if she wanted a drink.
-You don't drink.
-I couldn't think of anything else to say.
-So you started drinking.
-So we started drinking, and.
I don't know if it was the alcohol or the ammonia but the next thing I knew, she was mopping the floor with me.
-And how was it?
-The sex was okay but I threw up from the Hennigan's.
Good thing the cleaning lady was there.
Dick was fired.
You mean to tell me, I put that drink six inches over to the right -and this wouldn't have happened?
-You knew he was an alcoholic.
-Why'd you put the drink down?
-What are you saying?
-I'm not saying anything.
-Yes, you are.
-What could I be saying?
-You must be saying something.
If I was, I would have said it.
-Say it.
-I said it.
-What did you say?
-Nothing.
It's exhausting being with you.
-Yeah.
-It's George.
-Come on up.
-Hey.
Let me ask you something.
Did George buy that sweater knowing the red dot was on it because it was cheaper?
-Okay.
You just gave me the answer.
-No, I didn't.
Yes, you did.
Yes, you did.
I saw your expression.
I didn't have an expression.
I have a deviated septum.
I have to-- I have to open my mouth sometimes to breathe.
How much did he save?
Frankly, I am shocked that you could ask such a question of me.
If l-- The only surprise was how you could even think of that.
That's what you were seeing.
I have to talk to you.
This cleaning woman's turning the screws on me.
She's pushing for this whole relationship thing.
She keeps calling me.
She's threatening to go to the boss.
I could lose my job.
I gotta keep her quiet.
Elaine's in the bathroom.
She's wise to the red-dot thing.
She's asking me all kinds of questions about it.
-Did you tell her anything?
-No.
-You swear?
-I'm not swearing.
I don't wanna swear.
-Come on, swear.
-No.
-Oh, you told her, didn't you?
-No.
Hey, George, did you buy that sweater knowing the red dot was on it because you could get it at a discount?
What?
-Did I what?
-You did, didn't you?
Elaine, I'm shocked.
I'm shocked.
Here I go out, in the spirit of the season and spend all my savings to buy you the most beautiful Christmas sweater I have ever seen to show my appreciation to you at Christmas and this is the thanks I get at Christmas.
-Well, Jerry told me that you did.
-You told her?
How could you tell her?
What kind of friend are you?
I didn't tell her, you stupid idiot.
She tricked you.
Elaine, you don't understand.
I had a 103 temperature when I bought that sweater.
I was so dizzy, I was seeing red dots everywhere.
I thought everything in the store had a red dot on it.
I couldn't distinguish one red dot from the other.
I couldn't afford anything.
I have nothing.
I haven't worked for a really long time.
I mean, look, I have no clothes.
Look at what I'm wearing.
It was just a little red dot.
A little red dot.
-This is for you.
-Oh, Georgie, you bought this for me?
Oh, I knew you cared for me.
As you care for me, which is why it's very important that you never breathe a word to anyone about.
You know?
What with Clarence Thomas and everything.
-Okay.
Can I open it now?
-Yes, of course.
Go ahead.
My guess is you're gonna like this very much.
-ls that cashmere?
-Of course it's cashmere.
Oh, a cashmere sweater.
Oh, Georgie Porgie.
Just a little something for Christmas.
When I was a little girl in Panama, a rich American came to our town.
And he was wearing the softest, most beautiful sweater.
I said, "What do you call this beautiful fabric"?
And he said: "They call it cashmere".
I repeated the word.
"Cashmere, cashmere" and I asked him if I could have it and he said: "No.
Get away from me".
And he started to walk away.
Oh, but I grabbed onto his leg screaming for him to give me the sweater and he dragged me through the streets.
And then he kicked me with the other foot and he threw some change at me.
But I didn't want the change, Georgie.
I wanted the cashmere.
I had a feeling you would like it.
-I'm going to try it on.
-No.
Don't try it on now.
Try it later.
Oh, look, it fits beautiful.
All right, take it off.
You're gonna ruin it.
What's this?
I was in a men's room the other day.
They had the hand blower instead of the paper towels.
You know this thing?
I like the hand blower, I have to say.
Takes a little bit longer, but I feel when you're in a room with a revolting stench, you want to spend as much time as you can.
The only stench is coming from you.
Oh, well, wait a second.
I believe we have a heckler, ladies and gentlemen.
Dick, I don't know what your problem is.
It's not my fault you're back on the wagon.
It's "off the wagon".
In the old days, how do you think they got the alcohol from town to town?
-I don't know.
-On a wagon.
Don't you think they broke into a couple of those bottles along the way?
You can't drink on a wagon.
It's too bumpy.
They had smooth trails.
What about the Cumberland Gap?
What the hell do you know about wagons?
I know enough not to get on them.
I'm gonna get right to the point.
It's come to my attention that you and the cleaning woman have engaged in sexual intercourse on the desk in your office.
Is that correct?
-Who said that?
-She did.
Was that wrong?
Should I not have done that?
I gotta plead ignorance on this thing because if anyone had said anything to me when I started here that that sort of thing was frowned upon.
You know, because I've worked in a lot of offices and I tell you, people do that all the time.
You're fired.
Well, you didn't have to say it like that.
I want you out of here by the end of the day.
What about the whole Christmas-spirit thing?
Any flexibility there?
No.
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
She wanted me to give you this.
You had sex on your desk with the cleaning woman.
You never had sex in the office before?
No.
I once made out with someone, but that's it.
Okay.
All right.
So you made out.
-Well, that's not sex.
-Kissing is sex.
Kissing is not sex.
-George.
-Jerry.
Hey, did Jerry leave that drink next to Dick's on purpose?
-No.
-George?
Over here.
What are you doing here?
I'm taking the kid out to dinner to cheer him up.
Hey, Jerry, when do you consider sex has taken place?
I would say when the nipple makes its first appearance.
So George told me that you left the drink next to Dick's on purpose.
Nice try.
So guess who heckled me at the club last night.
Merry Christmas!
-Oh, my God, that's Dick.
-Dick?
Dick!
It's Cape Fear.
Hide.
Hide under the desk.
-Move over.
-Get off of me.
-I have no room.
-My foot's sticking out.
Shut up.
He's coming.
Is that cashmere?
Of course it's cashmere.
What's this?
But, in a way, I think I inadvertently turned this guy into an alcoholic.
I hate being around alcoholics.
They're either saying how much they love you or how much they hate you.
Those are the two statements that scare me most.
But I think he's okay now because I don't know how he feels about me.
-He's finally off the wagon.
-You mean on the wagon.
Don't get smart.

{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
As a kid, my favourite ride was the bumper car.
Remember?
Going around in a circle.
There was always one kid that could not do it.
Do you remember this kid?
As soon as the ride gets started he'd be, like, stuck in a pack of empty cars.
Just-- "Excuse me.
Excuse me.
It won't go!
Come on!
It's almost over"!
He always ends up with the attendant hanging off that big pole helping him steer it.
"Stop crying".
Then there's always that other-- One other really bad car-- The helpless father-and-son team.
This is another car just not going anywhere.
They're never organized.
Who's on the wheel?
Who's pressing on the gas?
Just: "Son, turn the wheel".
All right, Coney lsland?
Okay, you can take the B or the F and switch for the N at Broadway and Lafayette.
Or you can go over the bridge to DeKalb and catch the Q to Atlantic Avenue then switch to the lRT, But don't get on the G. That's very tempting, but you wind up on Smith and 9th Street.
Then you gotta get on the R. Couldn't he just take the D straight to Coney lsland?
Well, yeah.
Okay.
What time is your job interview, George?
Don't whistle on the elevator.
-Why not?
-That's what Willy Loman told Biff before his interview in Death of a Salesman.
You're comparing me to Biff Loman?
Very encouraging.
The biggest loser in the history of American literature.
-I gotta get going.
-What time's the lesbian wedding?
-9:30.
-Lesbian wedding.
How do they work the bride and groom on that?
Do they flip a coin?
Yeah, they flip a coin.
What, was that not politically correct?
It's a legitimate question.
I'm so tired.
I'm gonna fall asleep on that train.
I feel when lesbians are looking at me, they're thinking: "That's why I'm not a heterosexual".
All right, Jerry, come on.
Pick up the check so we can go.
-I'm paying for breakfast?
-Yeah.
-Yeah.
-Why do I always pay?
What am l, made of money?
You bunch of deadbeats.
How many tickets you paying today?
Let's see.
Speeding, running a red light, no licence, no registration no plates, no brake lights, no rear-view mirror.
Look at that one.
-"No doors"?
-Yeah, I'm fighting that one.
You know, this is gonna cost me over 600 bucks.
I can't carry change in these pants.
It falls out.
-Here you go.
-There you go.
Thank you.
That guy's not blind.
So can I convince anybody to come down to Coney lsland?
Gotta pick up my car at the pound.
George?
I can't believe they found your stolen car.
Not only did they find it it was simonized, and the front end was aligned.
-That's amazing.
-So, what do you say?
Ride on the Cyclone.
Hot dog at Nathan's on me.
Who are you, Satan?
I'm close to a job here.
-It's my second interview.
-All right, Biff.
Elaine?
Merry-go-round?
I can't.
I'm the best man.
Kramer.
Bumper cars.
I gotta go to court.
I'll get in trouble.
What's the matter with you?
It could be years till I get back to Coney lsland.
I can't go on the rides alone.
and the double R the 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, the C, K and F train.
Well.
See you.
Hey!
Yeah!
-You looking for a job?
-Me?
Why?
Well, you're reading the classifieds.
Oh, no.
No, no.
I was just looking for the stock page.
Here it is.
Looking for the quotes.
Gotta check the quotes.
Love a good quote.
IBM up a quarter.
What do you know?
You didn't look like someone who needed a job.
Me?
No, I don't.
Doing very well.
Very well, yeah.
So you're in the market?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I'm in the market.
Which market?
Which market?
The.
The big one.
The big market with the big board.
Bull market, bear market.
You name the market, I'm there.
So do you work for one of the big brokerage houses?
They wish.
I hate the big brokerage houses.
Hate them with a passion.
Big brokerage houses killed my father.
-Really?
-Well, they hurt him bad.
Really hurt his feelings.
It's a long story.
I don't like to talk about it but I swore I would never work for a big brokerage house.
See, all they care about is money.
I'm about more than money.
I'm about people.
So I've always gone my own way and I've never looked back.
I started riding these trains in the '40s.
Those days, a man would give up his seat for a woman.
Now we're liberated.
We have to stand.
It's ironic.
What's ironic?
This.
That we've come all this way, we made all this progress but, you know, we lost the little things, the niceties.
No, I mean, what does "ironic" mean?
Where you off to with such a nice present?
-Birthday party?
-A wedding.
-A wedding?
-Yeah.
I didn't think people still get married.
It's hard today with the men and women.
You're telling me.
-So they're a nice couple?
-Oh, very nice.
What does he do, if you don't mind my asking?
-She.
-She?
She.
She works, he doesn't.
He sounds like my son.
There is no "he".
There's no he?
So who's getting married?
Two women.
It's a lesbian wedding.
Lesbian wedding?
Yep.
Yep, I'm the best man.
Great.
My luck.
I don't talk to a soul on the subway for 35 years I get the best man at a lesbian wedding.
No, no.
You don't understand.
I'm not a lesbian!
I hate men, but I'm not a lesbian.
I'm really looking forward to this.
I love weddings.
Maybe I'll meet somebody.
Maybe not.
Oh, man.
We're stopping?
Well, this is where I get off.
-You do?
-Yeah.
Hey, why don't you?
Oh, nothing.
No, no.
What?
Well, I was gonna say, "Why don't you get off with me".
But you're obviously very busy on your way to some important meeting or something.
Yeah.
Well.
See, I knew it was a bad idea.
Hey, what's another million, give or take?
I get off when and where I wanna get off.
I'm stuck.
Could you just pull it a little--?
This'll just be a second.
Don't-- Don't start the train!
Don't start the train!
Here it is.
Here it is, the four horse in the first race.
-Pappernick.
-How do you know he's gonna win?
My UPS guy.
Lance.
The guys who own the horse are his regular customers.
Every horse he's ever given me has won.
-Yeah?
-Yeah.
They've been sandbagging Iooking for a good spot.
He's been getting in light because they're using a bug boy.
The workouts have been unpublished.
They're ready to run with him.
Gonna break his maiden.
He's gonna go for a great price, maybe 30-1.
-I'm telling you, it's a lock.
-But it rained last night.
Exactly.
This horse loves the slop.
It's in his bloodlines.
His father was a mudder.
-His mother was a mudder.
-His mother was a mudder?
What did I say?
Let's go to the office.
I'm gonna call my bookie.
Hey, don't tell anybody.
Oh, man.
Okay.
You realize, of course, you're naked.
Naked, dressed, I don't see any difference.
You ought to sit here.
There's a difference.
You got something against the naked body?
I got something against yours.
How about a couple of deep knee bends, maybe some squat-thrusts?
Who's got time for squat-thrusts?
All right, how about skipping breakfast?
I'm guessing you're not a "half-grapefruit and black coffee" man.
I like a good breakfast.
I understand.
I like a good breakfast Iong as you don't wind up trapped in a room in overalls and pigtails being counselled by Dick Gregory.
I'm not ashamed of my body.
Exactly.
That's your problem.
You should be.
Don't get up.
Please, allow me.
Oh, this is great.
This is what I need, just what I need.
Okay, take it easy.
I'm sure it's nothing.
Probably rats on the track.
They're stopping for rats.
God, it's so crowded.
How could there be so many people?
This guy really smells.
Doesn't anyone use deodorant in the city?
What is so hard?
You take the cap off, you roll it on.
What's that?
I feel something rubbing against me.
These disgusting animals.
These people should be in a cage.
We are in a cage.
What if I miss the wedding?
I got the ring.
What'll they do?
You can't get married without a ring.
Oh, God-- I can't breathe.
I feel faint.
Okay, take it easy.
It'll start moving soon.
Think about people in concentration camps, what they went through.
And the hostages!
What would you do if you were a hostage?
Think about that.
This is nothing.
No, it's not nothing, it's something.
It's a nightmare.
Help me!
Move it!
Come on!
Move this f****** thing!
Why isn't it moving?
!
What could go wrong with a train?
It's on tracks.
There's no traffic.
How could a train get stuck?
Step on the gas!
What could it be?
You'd think the conductor would explain it to us.
"I'm sorry, there's a delay.
We'll be moving in five minutes.
" I wanna hear a voice.
What's that on my leg?
!
Nice.
Your company sends you on the road often, huh?
Nice.
Oh, hey, nice ice bucket there.
Make yourself comfortable.
Make myself comfortable?
What does that mean?
Does she want me to take my clothes off?
Is she taking her clothes off?
What if I take mine off and she still has hers on?
I'd look like an idiot.
She'd get offended and leave.
So maybe I should leave them on.
But what if she takes hers off?
She'll feel humiliated.
"Make yourself comfortable"?
This woman's unbelievable.
This "comfortable" thing could ruin me.
I got it.
I'll take my shoes off and sit on the bed.
There.
That's comfortable.
She can't accuse me of being uncomfortable.
I gotta tell you, I'm pretty comfortable.
Oh, yeah, it's all set.
-They've got the bug boy on it.
-The bug boy?
Yeah, the little fellow's been riding his heart out.
-They're gonna break his maiden.
-Really?
-Yeah.
-It's a little slow out.
-Rained last night.
-This baby loves the slop.
Loves it.
Eats it up.
Eats the slop.
Born to slop.
His father was a mudder.
-His father was a mudder.
-His mother was a mudder.
His mother was a mudder?
What did I just say?
Hey.
All right.
Six hundred, Pappernick to win.
They still have no pitching.
Gooden's a question mark.
You don't recover from those rotator cuffs so fast.
I'm not worried about the Mets' pitching.
-They got no hitting.
-No, they got hitting.
Bonilla, Murray.
-They got no defence.
-Defence, please.
-They need speed.
-Speed?
They've got Coleman.
-They need a bullpen.
-Franco's no good?
-They got no team leaders.
-They got Franco.
What they need is a front office.
-But you gotta like their chances.
-I love them.
If they win it this year, I'll sit naked with you at the World Series.
It's a deal.
Why couldn't I take a cab?
For $6, my whole life could have changed.
What is that on my leg?
I'll never get out of here.
What if I'm here for the rest of my life?
Maybe I'll get out in five seconds.
One banana, two banana three banana, four banana five banana.
No.
I'm still here.
Still here.
When will they start moving?
Move!
Move!
Move!
It's moving.
It's moving!
Yes!
Yes.
Mother******!
Gee, I hope you have the key for these things.
Oh, don't worry, I do.
My mother used to walk around our apartment in her bra and panties.
She didn't look anything like you.
She was really disgusting, really bad body.
You know, if you can imagine an uglier, fatter version of Shirley Booth.
Remember Shirley Booth in Hazel?
Really embarrassing, because I had the only mother in the neighbourhood who was worse than Hazel.
-You can imagine the taunts I'd hear.
-Like what?
Like: "Hey, your mother's uglier than Hazel".
"Hazel really puts your mother to shame".
You know.
What's going on?
It was a pleasure doing business with you, but I have to get going.
Get going?
But we haven't really, you know.
Eight dollars?
-Eight dollars?
-What are you doing, robbing me?
I wasted my whole morning on you for $8?
Wait a second.
What are you doing?
-I'm taking your clothes.
-No, no, that's my only suit!
It cost me $350!
I got it at Moe Ginsburg!
-Bye, George.
-You can't just leave me here.
Will I see you again?
It's Hoy's Boy followed by Jamet Little Baggit, Kiss Harmony and then a long way to Flagrant.
-Come on!
-Into the stretch with an 1/8th of a mile to go, Stepagain, Passionel battling it out.
Clear from Jamet, Pappernick's starting to make some ground -but Stepagain is the leader.
-Come on.
-Come on!
Yes!
-Look at Pappernick, sprouting wings.
-Yes!
Yes!
-Stepagain, just falling back.
-Yes!
-Pappernick flashing home.
Stepagain, Pappernick, Pappernick and Stepagain to the line.
-Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
-The winner is Pappernick.
Yes, yes!
I won.
Hey!
Yeah.
I haven't had a hot dog at Nathan's in 20 years.
First, we ride the Cyclone.
Chilly out.
French fries.
Hey, hey!
Give me the money.
Freeze!
Police!
No, I never got the car.
We had such a good time by the time I got to the police garage, it was closed.
Too bad.
You wouldn't believe what this guy put away at Nathan's.
Look at what we won.
You want him?
Get that out of my face.
So you missed the wedding.
You'll catch the bris.
Hare Krishna!
Hare Krishna!
How'd you like a Hare Krishna fist down your throat, you little punk?
George.
Biff.
What, did you whistle on the elevator?
I have my spare key in your apartment, right?
Yeah, in the kitchen drawer.
-Give me your key.
-What happened?
Never mind what happened, just give me the key.
-Come on, I'll go with you.
-Here.
Pay.
Wait, wait.
Give me that.
All right.
So I take the subway down to Coney lsland to go on the Cyclone.
I'm riding on the subway.
I'm sitting on the D train for an hour and 15 minutes to go on a scary ride.
Okay, how dumb is that?
You know that first sharp drop on the Cyclone?
Fell asleep.

{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Women put on perfume in an interesting way.
Ever notice that, guys?
They have their little key, Stratego little areas.
Places they think we're going.
And they always hit this one.
Women are convinced that this is the most action-packed area that could ever happen in the dating world.
What is that, ladies?
What is happening here?
Is that in case you slap the guy or something?
He still finds you intriguing?
"Oh, Chanel"!
She's a pianist, a classical pianist!
She plays the piano!
She's a brilliant woman!
I sat in her living room, she played the Waldstein Sonata.
The Waldstein!
We did a crossword puzzle together in bed.
It was the most fun I ever had in my entire life!
Do you hear me?
In my life!
You know?
Were you talking?
I couldn't hear anything.
I was telling you about Noel.
Oh, Noel, yeah.
The one that plays the bongos.
So sidesplittingly funny.
All right, I'm sorry.
What about her?
You think I'm gonna repeat the whole thing?
You told me you like her.
Everything's going good.
No, everything's not going good.
I'm very uncomfortable.
I have no power.
Why should she have the upper hand?
For once, I'd like the upper hand.
I have no hand, no hand at all.
She has the hand.
I have no hand.
-Hand me that, would you?
-Yeah.
How do I get the hand?
We all want the hand.
Hand is tough to get.
You gotta get the hand right from the opening.
She's playing a recital at the McBierny School.
I got two extra tickets.
You and Elaine could go.
Yeah, that sounds like something.
Then afterwards, maybe we could all go out together.
You know, she'll see me with my friends.
She'll observe me as I really am, as myself.
Maybe I can get some hand that way.
-Oh, hey.
-Hey.
Hey, smell my arm.
-What?
-Smell it.
Smell it.
With all due respect, I don't think so.
-Jerry, smell.
-That smells good.
What is that?
-The beach.
-The beach?
Did you go swimming?
It's 29 degrees.
No, I just joined the Polar Bear Club.
-You joined the Polar Bears?
-What the hell's a Polar Bear?
These people go swimming in the winter.
They're terrific.
I just took my first swim today.
-It's invigorating.
-Yeah so is shock therapy.
-What is that, a PEZ dispenser?
-Yeah.
You want one?
I just bought it at the flea market.
You want one?
Hey, what goes on there, exactly?
You don't know?
No, I know.
I know.
You think they have fleas there, don't you?
-No.
-Yes, you do, Biff.
You've never been, and you think they have fleas there.
All right, I think they have fleas there.
So what?
-Here, you want this?
-You don't want it?
-No, I bought five of them.
-Wow, great.
Thanks.
I don't know how anyone does this.
This must be so nerve-racking.
How do they warm up their fingers?
They have a piano backstage they warm up on.
No.
We would have heard it.
You think they just crack their knuckles and come out?
-I told her we'd go out afterwards.
-Sure.
Don't applaud when she stops playing the first time.
It's not over yet.
I really resent that.
That's directed at me, isn't it?
Is this okay?
Can I do this?
Oh, God.
Something I said?
It's John Mollica.
Oh.
Oh, John.
Oh, hi, John.
-Hi.
-What are you doing out here?
I was just at this recital and Jerry put this PEZ dispenser on my leg and I just started laughing.
-Jerry's in there?
-Yeah.
-I heard you guys broke up.
-We did.
We're just hanging out.
Really?
Boy you really look great.
Oh, thank you.
Hey, are you still friends with Richie Appel?
Oh, Richie?
He's been doing comedy in L.A. for a couple of years.
He just got back a month ago.
He's kind of messed up on drugs.
I don't know what to do.
Have you thought about an intervention?
-What's that?
-You get all his friends in a room and they confront him to try to get him into rehab.
It's a very popular thing now.
Well, he'd never listen to anyone.
Except, of course, Jerry.
He'd listen to Jerry.
Jerry would have to be involved.
He really respects Jerry.
I'm sorry, George.
I'm sorry.
What did you put the PEZ dispenser on her leg for?
-I don't know.
It was an impulse.
-What kind of a sick impulse is that?
How could I know she'd start to laugh?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I am.
-Could we go in already?
-What are we gonna tell her?
-I'll tell her I was the one who laughed.
-No, don't say a word.
If she thinks my friends are jerks, then I'm a jerk.
Remind me to talk to you about something.
-What about?
-Hey, we're discussing something.
I know, but I'm distracted now.
What are you, a baby?
All right, tell him.
When I was outside, I ran into John Mollica.
-Really?
John Mollica?
-Yeah.
The guy that used to bartend at the comedy club.
-How's he doing?
-He's good.
Could we cut to the chase?
"Cut to the chase"?
-Yeah.
-What are you, Joe Hollywood?
A lot of people say it.
I would lose that.
What's that?
"Lose that"?
That's not a Hollywood expression.
Yes, it is.
Anyway.
So John told me that Richie is in town from Los Angeles and he's really messed up on drugs.
So I told him he should do an intervention.
-Really?
An intervention?
-We got a situation over here!
-But he wants you to be a part of it.
-Why me?
He says Richie really respects you, and he would listen to you.
These things are really hard to load.
All right, okay.
All right, I'm going in.
-We got to talk about this.
-All right.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
-You were wonderful.
Wonderful.
-No, no.
These are my friends, Elaine and Jerry.
Noel.
You play a hell of a piano.
Yeah, I was really moved.
Really moved.
Didn't you hear that person laughing?
I couldn't play.
I was humiliated!
I'm sure it wasn't at you.
Well, then what was she laughing at?
-PEZ?
-No, thank you.
Did you see her?
Me?
No, l. Anyone who would laugh at a recital ..
is probably some sort of lunatic, anyway.
I mean, only a sick, twisted mind could be that rude and ignorant.
Well, you know, maybe some mental defective put something stupid on her leg.
Even if this so-called mental defective did put something on her leg she's still the one who laughed.
I'll never forget that laugh for the rest of my life.
I'm sure she would apologize if she could.
Probably someone is holding her back maybe against every fibre of her being.
If she wants to continue to have a fibre of her being, she'll be very careful.
-Don't hit me.
-Stop it.
All right.
So you ready?
We'll go out, and we'll have a bite to eat.
I don't feel like it tonight.
-We'll be outside.
-Yeah.
It was nice meeting you.
By the way, how do you warm up your fingers before you play?
I just crack my knuckles.
Come on, we'll have a good time.
-Well, I'm really not in the mood.
-Come on.
I said, I don't feel like it.
All right.
I'll-- I'll call you.
I'll call you, and we'll talk on the phone.
Have a telephone communiqué.
So, fine.
Everything's fine.
Everything good?
Good.
I feel good.
Fine.
That's fine.
That's good.
Okay.
Okey-doke.
You know, I think Kramer might have been indirectly responsible for getting Richie involved in drugs.
What?
How?
A few years ago, the comedy club had a softball team.
Kramer was our first baseman.
You couldn't get anything by him.
He was unbelievable.
Anyway, this one game, we came back to win from, like, eight runs behind.
So Kramer says to Richie: "Why don't you dump the bucket of Gatorade on Marty Benson's head"?
-The club owner.
-Yeah.
So Richie goes ahead and does it.
-So?
What happened?
-What happened?
The guy was, like, 67 years old.
It was freezing out.
He caught a cold, developed pneumonia, a month later -he was dead.
-Shut up.
All the comedians were happy because he's one of these club owners nobody liked.
But Richie was never the same.
-What about Kramer?
-He's the same.
Are you sure you want me, John?
I mean, I haven't spoken to Richie in two years.
I don't have a good apartment for an intervention.
The furniture, it's very nonconfrontational.
All right, all right.
Goodbye.
Remember Richie Appel?
Oh, sure.
The guy I told to pour the Gatorade that killed Marty Benson?
Right.
John Mollica is organizing some kind of intervention for him.
We're having it here.
Can I get in on that?
What do you think, it's like a poker game?
-ls Elaine going?
-Yeah.
Well, I knew him as well as she did.
Yeah, but John invited her.
So wait, you don't want me to intervene?
No, intervene, go ahead.
Intervene all you want.
I'm just afraid you might be interfering while we're intervening.
-Yeah?
-It's George.
Come on up.
Stop smelling your arm!
You know, I got a great idea for a cologne.
It's called "The Beach".
You spray it on, and it's just like you came home from the beach.
A cologne that smells like the beach.
I can't believe I'm saying this, but that's not a bad idea.
Tell me about it.
Why don't you call Steve D'Giff?
He works in the marketing department at Calvin Klein.
In fact, he's a good friend of John Mollica and Richie, also.
Okay.
Well, it's over.
It's definitely over.
-She broke up with you?
-No, but she's going to.
I can sense it.
We had this terrible phone conversation.
I was so nervous before I called, I made a list of things to talk about.
What was on the list?
Let's see.
"I'm very good at going in reverse in my car.
Why isn't Postum a more popular drink"?
Yeah, Postum is underrated.
Anyway, there was all this tension.
I asked her if she wanted to go out to dinner and she said, "No, maybe we could have lunch".
-You know what that means.
-What's wrong with lunch?
Lunch is fine at the beginning, then you move on to dinner.
You don't go back to lunch.
It's like being demoted.
I'll never do a crossword puzzle with her again, I know it.
I like the jumble.
You ever do the jumble?
I have no power, you understand?
I need hand!
I have no hand!
-Why don't you break up with her.
-What?
Break up with her.
You reverse everything that way.
A preemptive breakup.
A preemptive breakup.
-This is an incredible idea.
-Yeah.
I got nothing to lose.
We either break up, which she would do anyway but I go out with some dignity or I completely turn the tables!
This is absolutely brilliant!
So I'm afraid l am gonna have to break up with you.
-You're breaking up with me?
-Yes.
I am breaking up with you.
-Wow.
-Shocked?
-I really am.
-Never expected this, did you?
-I thought everything was fine.
-Well, live and learn.
Well, I don't understand.
You didn't enjoy being with me?
Didn't we have fun doing the crossword puzzle?
Kind of.
-I'm very confused.
-Well, I didn't mean to hurt you, kid.
-I thought-- -Now, stop it, please.
What do you want?
I know I can make you happy.
When you're playing the piano do you think about me?
-I don't know.
-This is what I'm talking about.
Okay, I'll think about you.
-All the time?
-All the time?
-You know-- -Okay, all the time.
-I can't hear you.
-All the time!
See?
It's not so hard.
Go ahead.
Smell.
Smell it.
-Yeah?
So?
-Now, you recognize it?
I don't know.
The beach.
-What are you talking about?
-Oh, I'm talking about the beach.
What about it?
You know the way you smell when you first come home from the beach?
Well, I want to make a cologne that captures the essence of that smell.
Oh, yeah.
That is the dumbest idea I've ever heard.
Whoa, wait a minute.
You.
Did you hear what I just said?
You think people are gonna pay $80 a bottle to smell like dead fish and seaweed?
That's why people take showers when they come home from the beach.
It's an objectionable, offensive odour.
So you don't think that it's a good idea?
The membranes get dry, and it just starts bleeding.
Since I was a kid, so I have to stick a tissue up there.
You have to work like that?
Yeah.
Nobody minds.
Nobody's ever said anything to me.
-There any ice cubes?
-Whatever's in the freezer.
I looked.
I don't see any ice cubes.
Well, then I guess there's no ice cubes.
I can't drink this.
It's warm.
John, shouldn't we rehearse this before Richie comes?
What's the plan?
Do I have to talk?
I don't want to.
If he's not gonna talk, then I don't want to.
-No, we all have to talk!
-What's the order?
Alphabetical order.
You're first, Roberta.
-Why am I first?
-Albano's your last name.
-Not anymore.
I'm divorced.
-I'll go first.
-Oh, hey!
-Hey.
-ls this the interference?
-lntervention.
-What are you doing here?
-Oh, is it all right if I stay?
He can't stay.
This is for close friends only.
Hey, I'm a friend.
Who told him to pour the Gatorade over Marty Benson's head?
-Oh, let him stay.
-Yeah.
Hey, I got somebody to make up that cologne for me, bigmouth.
Somebody's going to make that crap?
-Kramer!
-Hey, you guys!
All right!
Come on in.
These are some of my Polar Bear buddies.
-They can't stay.
-You're having a party here?
No, we're having an intervention.
An intervention?
Who's intervening?
He's a friend of ours on drugs, and we're gonna confront him.
Sure.
We used to do that when one of our Polar Bears stopped coming.
We'd go to his house: "What, you don't want to be a Polar Bear anymore?
-It's too cold for you"?
-It's him!
-What do we do?
-Hide!
It's not a surprise party!
-Yeah?
-It's George.
Come on up.
It's not him.
You don't wanna go out with me because I'm a bartender, right?
Look, you know, I don't really think that this is appropriate right now.
Is it because I have a tissue in my nose?
-You're getting warm.
-Hey, we just.
We just came from Chadway's.
What's going on?
The intervention.
We're waiting for Richie.
Right, the intervention.
Should we leave?
-Well.
-Elaine, hi.
Hi, Noel.
Well, you're looking well.
Jerry, let me tell you something.
A man without hand is not a man.
I've got so much hand, I'm coming out of my gloves.
I gotta thank Kramer.
Even if I were dragged through manure I still wouldn't put that stuff on.
This man is a genius!
A genius!
-You think so?
-I don't think so, I know so.
Come here.
I gotta talk to you.
The male kangaroo doesn't have a pouch.
Only the female has it so the male has pouch envy!
"Why should she have this huge pouch and I have nothing?
I have things to carry too.
At least give me a pocket".
That laugh.
That's the laugh.
-That's it!
You're the one!
-No, no.
No, it was an accident.
It wasn't my fault!
It was Jerry!
Jerry put a PEZ dispenser on my leg!
You put a PEZ dispenser on her leg during my recital?
-I didn't know she would laugh.
-And, you.
You lied to me, George.
You lied to me!
No, l-- I didn't.
What did I do?
Where are you going?
I am breaking up with you.
You can't break up with me.
I've got hand!
And you're gonna need it.
Noel!
-Hey, Richie!
-Hey, Richie.
So, what's going on?
So we start the intervention, and it's pretty ugly from the get-go.
He's not listening, he's hostile, he's talking back.
I can't do these puzzles.
So he starts to get up.
Suddenly, he spots the PEZ dispenser on the coffee table.
The PEZ dispenser.
He picks it up, he's staring at it.
It's like he's hypnotized by it.
Then he's telling us this story about how when he was a kid he was in the car with his father and his father was trying to load one of them.
-Well, they're hard to load.
-Tell me something I don't know.
So as the father's trying to load it, he loses control of the car crashes into a high school cafeteria.
-Get out.
-Nobody's hurt but PEZ was all over the car.
And the dispenser was destroyed virtually beyond recognition.
-Poor kid.
-So as he's telling the story he starts crying.
-What did you do?
-What do you think?
-I gave him my PEZ dispenser.
-Wow.
Two hours later, he checks into Smither's clinic.
Talked to the doctor yesterday.
He's doing great on the rehab he's hooked on PEZ.
He's eating them like there's no tomorrow.
What's a three-letter word for candy?
I can't do those things.
Jawbreakers, to me, was like the ultimate challenge candy.
It was like candy manufacturers were sitting in their laboratories, going: "l wonder if they'll eat this.
This seems pretty tough to eat.
Let's market it as some sort of experiment".
But the concept of Jawbreakers-- What was the concept?
Multicoloured cement balls for a quarter?
Was that the idea behind it?
"Let's see if we can hurt them.
Let's see if they'll pay to be hurt".
This is the idea behind Jawbreakers.
I did it, I ate them, I loved them.
"Oh, this is very painful.
I'm really hurting.
And this is hurting me a lot.
I love them".

I'm going to get a physical examination.
That urine sample.
Giving them that, that's always a pleasure, isn't it?
Then there's always the amount question: "l don't know what you need.
I gave you whatever I had there.
I got more.
Whatever you need, I can get it for you.
Just let me know what you need.
It's no problem, I mean".
But any kind of physical test, I don't know what it is I always click into this thing where I wanna do really well.
If it's gonna be a physical test, I wanna do well.
Remember in school, they'd do hearing tests?
And you'd really be listening, you know trying to really-- Trying to do well, I wanna do well.
I wanted to do unbelievable on that test.
I wanted them to come to me after the test and go: "We think you may have something close to super hearing.
What you heard was a cotton ball touching a piece of felt.
We're sending the results to Washington.
We'd like you to meet the president".
Let me ask you a question.
If you named a kid Rasputin do you think that would have a negative effect on his life?
No.
What are you doing?
We're going out to dinner.
Do you realize this is the last meal I'm gonna have for three days?
-Yeah.
-George.
Come on up.
I never heard of this.
You gotta fast for three days to take an ulcer test.
-How will you do that?
-I don't know.
How could I possibly have ulcers?
Who could have given me ulcers?
I think I'll take out the garbage.
Have you ever fasted?
Well, once I didn't have dinner till, like, 9:00.
I'll tell you, that was pretty rough.
Hey.
Do me a favour, will you?
Throw out my garbage for me.
Yeah.
Right.
Come on.
It's just down the hall.
Give me 2 bucks.
I'll do it for 2 bucks.
I'll give you 50 cents.
There's no way I'd touch that bag for less than $2.
Come on, 50 cents.
You can get yourself a Drake's Coffee Cake.
You're not getting no Drake's Coffee Cake for 50 cents.
I'm all set.
I got the ticket.
I'm going to the Cayman lslands Friday.
I don't get you.
Who goes on vacation without a job?
What do you need, a break from getting up at 1 1?
It's a deal.
I don't know why you don't come with me.
I don't go for nonrefundable deals.
I can't commit to a woman, I'm not committing to an airline.
-Hi.
-Hi.
How are you?
Gina, do you know Drake's Coffee Cake?
The plain cake with the sweet brown crumbs on the top.
-Right.
How much do they cost?
-The junior?
-No, the full-size.
-No, junior.
-You didn't say "junior".
-I haven't had one since I was little.
Really?
You should be ashamed of yourself.
I want you out of here.
-How you doing?
-Good enough.
-Boy, she's sexy, isn't she?
-Yeah.
-Do you believe that guy?
-What guy?
-My neighbour.
-That creepy guy?
-Did he think I was flirting with her?
-He didn't seem too pleased.
Maybe I'll get a steak with French-fried onion rings.
Hey, you know what?
I just remembered something.
I had a dream about that guy last night.
This is amazing.
-Amazing?
You've seen him before.
-I haven't seen him in months.
What was the dream?
He was doing standup comedy in Kennebunkport, Maine in this really ominous nightclub.
The stage was on a cliff and the audience was throwing all the comics off.
I think I've played there.
I've had a lot of paranormal stuff happen to me.
You're a little paranormal.
Name one paranormal thing that happened to you.
-I knew I was gonna be bald.
-Your father's bald.
Baldness is inherited from the mother's side, Jerry.
But your mother's bald too.
George, you know, my friend goes to a psychic.
-Really?
-We should go sometime.
I'd love to go.
Make an appointment.
Psychics, vacations.
How about getting a job?
-I just got fired.
-All right.
Let's get out of here.
I wonder what Gandhi ate before his fast.
I heard he used to polish off a box of Triscuits.
-Really?
-Oh, yeah.
Gandhi loved Triscuits.
Who is it?
-Who is it?
-It's Gina!
-Who?
-Martin's girlfriend.
-Martin?
-Your next-door neighbour.
Oh, Martin!
It's Martin.
I think he's dying.
He tried to kill himself with pills.
-What?
-Come on.
-Let me get my robe.
-We do not have time.
-Two seconds.
-There's no time.
-We don't have two seconds?
-All right, go ahead.
-No, forget it.
-No, go ahead.
-No, I'll just wear the pyjamas.
-Just get it!
-Are you sure?
-Forget it.
Come on.
No, I'll go get the robe.
It's not too bad.
It's not like a Sunny von Bülow coma.
Doctor said he should snap out of it any time.
You know why he did this?
Because I told him it was over.
-I did not want to see him anymore.
-Really?
It's over?
I could not stand it another minute.
Yesterday, he turned over a hot dog stand because he thought the man looked at me.
Then, after he saw you in the hall.
He was crazy with jealousy.
Oh, boy.
Did he say anything about me?
He does not like you.
And all indications are he does not like Drake's Coffee Cake.
-He said that?
-He was screaming about it all night.
How it's too sweet and it falls apart when you eat it.
I'm sorry if I caused any trouble.
I was just being friendly.
I wasn't.
You weren't?
No.
I have thought about you many times.
-Have you thought about me?
-Of course.
Tell me everything.
Are you sure he can't hear anything?
Martin.
Martin!
I wish he was not in a coma.
I wish he was dead.
I would like to pull the plug out from him!
I would wait on that one.
I know how you feel, but juries today you never know how they're gonna look at this.
I saw you looking at your watch.
You want to leave?
Go ahead.
-I wanted to see what time it was.
-Are you afraid of him?
-No.
-Then kiss me.
-Here?
-Yes, right here.
Is this the proper venue?
-You don't want to?
-No, no, I want to.
I very much want to.
I desire to.
I pine to.
Then kiss me right in front of him.
I can't!
What if he wakes up?
A man is lying here unconscious and you're afraid of him?
What kind of a man are you?
I'm a man who respects a good coma.
If it was one of those in-and-out comas, maybe.
But when a guy's got a coma going like this you don't wanna mess with it.
-Hey.
-Hey.
-Did you hear about Martin?
-Yeah, I heard.
I can't believe he's in a coma.
He's got my vacuum cleaner.
I loaned it to him, he never returned it.
The carpets are filthy.
-What am I gonna do?
-Who told you about Martin?
Newman.
He's good friends with him.
Bigmouth Newman.
I should have guessed.
He's got all my attachments, you know.
Let me ask you something.
How long do you have to wait for a guy to come out of a coma before you ask his ex-girlfriend out?
Oh, Gina?
Why wait?
Why not just call Dr. Kevorkian.
I don't get that whole suicide machine.
There's no tall buildings where these people live?
They can't wrap their lips around a revolver like a normal person?
What's going on between you and Gina?
Well, I went with her to the hospital last night.
So we're in the room and she's trying to get me to kiss her in front of him.
That's the great thing about Mediterranean women.
All right.
So, what did you do?
-Nothing.
-What kind of a man are you?
The guy is unconscious, in a coma and you don't have the guts to kiss his girlfriend?
I didn't know what the coma etiquette was.
There is no coma etiquette.
See, that's the beauty of the coma.
It doesn't matter what you do.
So you're saying his girl, his car, his clothes, it's all up for grabs.
You can just loot the coma victim.
I give them 24 hours to get out of it.
They can't get out of it by 24 hours, it's a land rush.
So if the coma victim wakes up in a month he's thrilled.
He got out of the coma.
-He goes home, there's nothing left?
-Nothing left!
That's why I'm trying to get that vacuum.
Somebody's gonna grab it.
Martin's spirit came to you as a warning.
Why would he come to George?
Because George has heightened extrasensory perception.
Faithy, get your finger out of your nose!
-I knew it.
I always felt different.
-You are.
Some coffee cake?
-Drake's?
-Yes.
-Did you buy this for me?
-No, why?
Because I love Drake's Coffee Cake.
-Maybe I did.
-Take it away.
She hasn't eaten in two days.
-Who's Pauline?
-Pauline?
Wait a minute.
Oh, my God.
My brother once impregnated a woman named Pauline.
-You think about her?
-When I hear her name.
Cut these with your left hand.
There was a woman.
Audrey.
She had a very big nose.
I see an Audrey, but with a small nose.
Yes, yes.
She had a nose job.
I loved her very deeply.
Will she ever speak to me again?
Not in this life.
-Should you be smoking?
-Does it bother you?
-You're pregnant.
-Elaine.
I smoked when I had Faithy.
What?
What?
I don't know about this trip, George.
You can see the Cayman lslands in there?
Is something gonna happen to me?
What?
It's really bad for the foetus, you know that?
She's a psychic.
She knows how the kid's gonna be.
Should I not go on this trip?
George I am going to tell you something and I want you to really hear me.
Now, listen, I just don't know how a person, with everything we now know about prenatal care, can put a cigarette in her mouth!
-What are you doing?
-It's disgusting.
-I don't need this!
-Look, please!
-I would like you both to leave.
-Oh, fine.
Well, I don't like to be around people who are just so irresponsible.
-Get the hell out.
-A plane crash?
!
A heart attack?
!
Lupus?
Is it lupus?
Do you want me to call the super?
He was an lsraeli commando.
If you don't say anything, I'll assume it's a plane crash.
-Get out.
-Not a plane crash.
Is it a plane crash?
Psychics should be licensed.
And it wouldn't be hard.
We could just give them the regular DMV test only with the silver dollars and the pizza dough over the eyes.
If you can do the parallel park like that, you're a psychic.
We can test these people, no question about it.
Like Kreskin.
Instead of just hiding his check why don't we try stopping his check.
Let's see how he handles that.
I do not like your toothbrush.
There are no bristles.
You can say what you want about me but I'll be damned if I'm gonna stand here while you insult my toothbrush.
It is too small for someone with such a big mouth.
Let me ask you what will you do if Martin wakes up?
Run away like a mouse?
No, more like the Three Stooges at the end of every movie.
Who are these Stooges you speak of?
They're a comedy team.
Tell me about them.
Everything.
Well, they're three funny-looking guys and they'd hit each other a lot.
-You will show me the Stooges?
-I will show you the Stooges.
-When?
-Well I don't really know where the Stooges are right now but if I locate them, you'll be the first to know.
Come.
You walk me to a cab.
Well, l. I don't want you to get upset or anything but with Martin and all, maybe it's not a good idea to be seen together in the building, because he had a lot of friends.
You are still afraid.
You are not a man.
Well, then what are all those ties and sport jackets doing in my closet?
Are you going to walk me to a cab or not?
Yeah, all right, all right.
-Why don't you just eat fruit.
-Fruit makes me incontinent.
I don't want you eating over here.
Hello, Gina.
Hello, Jerry.
Hello, Newman.
Do you think Newman would tell Martin if he wakes up?
What kind of sicko would do that?
He could kill me.
People smoke, Elaine.
My mother smoked.
It didn't hurt me.
Did you guys see that wall move?
Boy, it's a good thing we came.
Could there be a native problem in the Caymans?
Maybe there's native unrest.
Hi.
I haven't eaten in three days.
I was wondering how much longer it would be till I get my X-ray.
We'll call you.
George, I want you to promise me something.
If I'm ever in a coma in the first 24 hours, get everything out of my place and put it in storage.
-How come?
-Looters.
How do we know the dog food's any good?
Who tastes it?
She is really hungry.
-Hey.
-Kramer.
Well, Newman's upstairs visiting Martin.
Would you buy my Cayman lsland ticket?
-You're not going?
-No.
-Why not?
-The psychic said something terrible will happen.
I dig.
I want my vacuum cleaner!
Martin, I know you can hear me.
Look, my mother's coming to visit me.
She sees that rug, she's gonna kill me.
He can't hear you, you idiot.
Why don't you just buy another one.
Why would I buy another one when I spent 100 bucks on this one?
I have a carpet sweeper you can use.
I don't want a carpet sweeper.
They don't do anything.
It gets my rug clean.
The carpet sweeper is the biggest scam perpetrated on the American public since One Hour Martinizing.
You should take a look at my rug, then.
I wouldn't set foot in your house.
-Hello.
-Hey.
Hello, Jerry.
-How's he doing?
-Well, he looks happy to me.
I hope he stays this happy when he wakes up.
-Why wouldn't he?
-No reason.
He'll have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.
I'll bring him up to date.
-How up to date?
-All the way up.
Nothing could change your mind?
Well, it would take a lot, because a friend is something you earn.
Jerry has a friend who has free tickets to the Cayman lslands this weekend.
He's not going.
I don't care much for the beach.
I freckle.
-ls that a?
-Drake's Coffee Cake.
Where did you get that?
From my house.
I got a whole box of them.
Boy.
That's the full-size.
That's your big boy.
Can I have a bite?
I don't like to give out bites.
I got another one but I'm saving it for later.
Just one bite?
I don't think so.
You know, they're so fragile.
All right!
All right.
I won't say anything.
-You swear?
-I swear.
-On your mother's life?
-On my mother's life.
But here it was mountains of duck.
And not fatty duck either, but juicy, tender breasts of duck.
-Beautifully sliced.
-Faithy!
Sweetheart, no, don't run!
You could take as much as you want.
Sweetheart!
Sweetheart!
Faithy!
Hi.
Hi!
What are you doing here?
How did I know you were here?
Something drew me here.
This is phenomenal.
The nurse said she'd be back.
Supposed to take me to the delivery room.
Oh, that's great.
That's great.
I have to apologize for my friend the other day-- Friend?
I don't even know that woman.
I met her on the way over.
I couldn't get rid of her.
I tell you, my psychic instincts were a little off-- -Where's the nurse?
-I'm sure she'll be right back.
Sweetheart, why don't you run and get a nurse for Mommy.
I was just curious.
The other day you said something about my trip.
-Don't take that trip.
-Yeah!
Why?
Why?
-Because.
Because.
-All right, Rula.
It's time to go.
Yeah, because?
Because?
Assassins!
How dare they keep a person waiting like this!
Drake's Coffee Cake?
-Give me that!
-Jerry, you better stop her or I'll tell!
Elaine, no!
No!
Are there terrorists on the plane?
A hotel fire, is that it?
Typhus?
Malaria?
Yellow fever?
Lupus?
Is it lupus?
They did it right in this bed, Martin.
Right in front of you.
-I want my vacuum cleaner!
-I can explain!
It was disgusting!
What are you doing?
We're going to dinner in 10 minutes.
I never assisted in a birth before.
It's really quite disgusting.
-What did she name the kid?
-You wouldn't believe it.
Rasputin.
-Hey!
-Hey!
-When did you get back?
-A couple hours ago.
-So how was it?
-George I would like to thank you for the greatest four days of my life.
They were shooting the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue right in the hotel pool.
Not only that the hotel opened up an area on the beach for nude bathing and all of the models went down there.
I am on the next blanket from Elle Macpherson.
We played backgammon nude.
-Oh, she's a sweet kid.
-Nude backgammon with swimsuit models!
Oh, you know what?
The second day I was there, I stepped on a jellyfish.
It stung my foot.
That's probably what Rula was trying to warn you about.
-You gotta watch for the jellyfish.
-Yeah.
What's this?
It's an invitation to a housewarming for Martin and Gina.
-They moved in together?
-Yeah, some place in the Village.
-Yeah.
-It's Elaine.
All right, we're coming down.
-Where you going?
-We're taking Elaine to dinner.
She's gotta start the fast again.
You wanna go?
I'd like to, but a bunch of us from the islands are getting together.
-Elle Macpherson gonna be there?
-I gotta call her back.
The thing I don't understand about the suicide person is the people that try and commit suicide for some reason, they don't die, and then that's it.
They stop trying.
Why?
Why don't they just keep trying?
What has changed?
Is their life better?
No.
In fact, it's worse, because now they've found out here's one more thing you stink at.
That's why these people don't succeed at life to begin with.
Because they give up too easy.
I say pills don't work, try a rope.
Car won't start in the garage?
Get a tune-up.
You know what I mean?
There's nothing more rewarding than reaching a goal you've set for yourself.
SDl Media Group
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
I never really understood the importance of the conductor.
Between you and me, what the hell is this guy doing?
Do you really need somebody waving a stick in your face to play the violin?
Does that really help you out?
I could see how we need him at the beginning, okay?
Tap, tap, tap.
"Start".
Okay.
I could see how you need that.
But once we're going, okay.
Once it's all happening what do we need him for then?
I don't see the cellist looking up, "I'm confused.
I don't know what to do".
And the conductor goes, "Do this.
Like this".
"Oh, okay, thank you.
Thank you very much".
Why try anymore?
There's no sense to it.
I'll never meet anybody.
I should accept it.
-Oh, yes, you will.
-No, I won't.
Yeah, maybe you won't.
It's hard enough to meet a woman you dislike, much less like.
-Are my nostrils getting bigger?
-No.
See, why must it be so difficult?
Why all this tension and hostility?
Why can't I just walk up to a woman and say, "Hi, I'm George.
How are you"?
Is that so terrible?
H-- H-- Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
-There's no men out there.
-I know.
The problem is that the good ones know they're good.
They know they're in demand.
They're not interested in confining themselves to one person.
I hate the good ones.
Is Jerry a good one?
That's a good question.
I think he thinks he is.
The mediocre ones are available but so insecure about not being a good one that they always go, "I'm not good enough for you.
What are you doing with me"?
Eventually I just go, "You're right".
Maybe you need somebody between good and mediocre.
No, maybe I need somebody who has nothing.
Somebody who just appreciates being with me because he's so desperate.
It's gotten to the point where I'm flirting with operators on the phone.
I almost made a date with one.
Oh, so there's still hope.
I don't want hope.
Hope is killing me.
My dream is to become hopeless.
The hopeless don't care.
When you don't care, that indifference makes you attractive.
-So hopelessness is the key.
-It's my only hope.
You see, I wouldn't really mind so much but I feel badly for my mother.
If my mother weren't around, it wouldn't be so bad.
But, I'm telling you, if I'm not married by the time I'm 40, I'll have to kill her.
Because it's the only fair thing to do.
I just couldn't put her through that.
At least you're not bitter.
Who says I'm not bitter?
-Aren't you too young to be bitter?
-No, you can be young and bitter.
Just maybe not as bitter as I'll be But I'm bitter.
Anyway, don't tell anyone.
Don't worry.
Your bitterness is safe with me.
Okay.
Order me a piece of cake.
I'm gonna go throw up.
Look at my hands.
Look.
Filthy from the paper.
They should give you a Wet-Nap when you buy one, like at those rib joints.
-What did you do last night?
-Went out with George.
You?
Went out with Cynthia.
What did you talk about?
Oh, you know, the usual.
The Federal Reserve, the rain forest.
Cynthia felt we should nuke the rain forest.
Get rid of it in one fell swoop so we could eliminate it as a subject of conversation.
-What about you?
-We brushed on that.
Actually, George was in rare form.
He just can't find anybody.
I know.
Cynthia too.
-She's really given up.
-George too.
-Yeah, right.
-Yeah, right.
-I've never fixed anybody up.
-Me neither.
And I am not about to start with George.
Well, why wouldn't you start with George?
You think she's too good for George?
I didn't say "too good," did l?
-You implied it.
-I didn't say it.
If you think she's too good for George you are dead wrong.
Dead wrong.
Who is she?
-Who is he?
-He's George.
-She's Cynthia.
-So what?
What, you don't think she's beautiful?
What's with the eyebrows?
You know what your problem is?
Your standards are too high.
I went out with you.
That's because my standards are too low.
And by the way, women kill for eyebrows like that.
Do you know that?
Women pluck their real eyebrows out of their head one by one until they're bald, Jerry, bald above the eyes.
And then they paint in these eyebrows to look like that.
Well, let me tell you something about George.
He is fast.
He can run like the wind.
And he's strong.
I've seen him lift 100 pounds over his head without even knowing it.
You wouldn't know it to look at him, but George can bait a hook.
-He can really do that?
-Come on, let's do it.
I think they'll really get along.
-What, are you into this?
-Yeah, come on, it's a good match.
Wait.
They'll be telling us how their dates went.
Are we gonna share that information?
Naturally.
We're going to tell each other everything?
Every secret?
Everything.
-What if it worked out?
-Yeah, right Out of the question.
Out of the question.
-Why?
-No.
I'm not going to do that.
It's one step away from personal ads.
Then prostitutes.
No!
No!
I am not going down that road.
What does she look like?
-She's good-looking.
-How good-looking?
-Very good-looking.
-Really good-looking?
-Really very good-looking.
-Would you take her out?
-Yes, I would.
-You hesitated.
-What hesitate?
I didn't hesitate.
-Something's up.
You hesitated.
I'm telling you, she's good-looking.
-What about the body?
-Good body.
Nice body.
-How nice?
-Nice.
Pretty nice.
-Really good?
-Really very nice and good.
-What about personality?
-Good personality.
Funny.
Bright.
I don't want anyone smarter than me.
How could she be smarter than you?
All right, let's see.
Let's see.
What else?
What else?
What does she do?
First of all, what does he do?
He was in real estate.
He's not working right now.
Oh!
He's not working?
No.
No.
No.
How come he's not working?
Well, I mean, he got fired.
Why did he get fired?
Oh, right.
Well.
He tried topoison his boss.
Excuse me?
It's such a long story.
Seriously, he just had some problems at work.
-ls he nuts?
-No, no, no.
He's a really, really funny guy.
What does he look like?
-Pardon?
-What does he look like?
Well, he's got a lot of character in his face.
He's short.
He's stocky.
He's fat.
Is that what you're saying, that he's fat?
Powerful.
He is so powerful.
He can lift And, what else?
What else?
Oh, right, well.
He's, he's kind of-- Just kind of-- Losing his hair.
-He's bald?
-No.
No, no, no.
He's not bald.
He's balding.
-So he will be bald?
-Yeah.
-What kind of hair?
-You know, long, dark hair.
Flowing?
Flowing?
Is it flowing?
I like flowing, cascading hair.
Thick, lustrous hair is important to me.
"Thick, lustrous hair is important to me".
-ls that what you said?
-Right.
Just clarifying.
Let me ask you this.
If you stick your hand in the hair, is it easy to get it out?
Do you want to get it out?
Or do you want to not be able to get it out?
-I'd like to be able to get it out.
-I think you'll get it out.
What about the skin?
I need a good cheek.
I like a good cheek.
She's got a fine cheek.
Is there a pinkish hue?
-A pinkish hue?
-Yes, a rosy glow.
There's a hue.
She's got great eyebrows.
Women kill to have her eyebrows.
Who cares about eyebrows?
Is she sweet?
I like sweet.
But not too sweet.
You could throw up from that.
I don't think you'll throw up.
She likes to throw up.
-Has he ever been married?
-No.
Has he been close?
He once spent a weekend with a woman.
He didn't really try to poison his boss.
Yeah, he did.
We had an incredible phone conversation.
We talked for, like, 20 minutes.
I threw away my notes in the middle of the call.
I thought she had a great voice timbre.
Is it "timbre" or "tambre"?
-I think it's tambre.
-Why'd I think timbre?
She could do voice-overs.
You didn't tell me about her voice?
-I didn't notice the voice.
-It's mellifluous.
So, Saturday night.
She had to be impressed by that conversation.
It was a great performance.
I am unbelievable on the phone.
On the date, they should just have two phones on the table at the restaurant.
-Hi.
-Hi!
-Out we go Saturday night.
-I know.
-So, what did she say?
-You're getting together Saturday night.
-That's it?
-Yeah.
-She didn't mention the conversation?
-No.
See?
I don't get that.
We had a relaxed, stimulating, great conversation.
She doesn't mention it?
-Why not mention it?
-What?
She could have mentioned it.
All right.
All right.
I'll go on the date, but that's that.
You know my friend Bob Sacamano?
-The guy from Jersey.
-He just got a job at a condom factory.
Look at this.
He gave me a gross.
-What will you do with all of them?
-Oh, well.
Take some, Jerry.
Grab them.
No, thanks.
They look like they came out of a cereal box.
Come on, Elaine, here.
Take half a bag.
Half a bag?
What am l, a hooker?
Anyway, they look kind of cheap.
I'll take one.
It's possible.
The problem with the condom is still buying them.
I think we should have, like, a secret signal with the druggist.
You walk into the store, go to the counter.
He looks at you.
And if you go like this: He puts them in the bag for you.
That's it.
Show up there with your little shaving cream, your little toothpaste.
"How are you today"?
"Have a nice day".
"You too".
So where are they?
It's 1 1 :45.
They should be back by now.
-What did they do?
-I think they went out to dinner.
Oh, wait.
I got another call.
That must be him.
-Hello.
-It's me.
I just got home.
Hold on.
-It's George.
He just got home.
-Yeah.
I got Cynthia on the line.
-I'll call you back when I'm done.
-Remember our pact: full disclosure.
Of course.
Yeah, go ahead.
I'm gonna tell you, but I made a pact with Cynthia.
We swore we wouldn't tell you and Elaine.
-You can tell.
I'll vault it.
-It's in the vault?
I'm locking the vault.
What?
Come on.
-We had sex.
-Oh, my God, you had sex?
-How did that happen?
-I don't know.
I closed my eyes and made a move.
-At your apartment?
-Yeah.
-She didn't stay over?
-No.
She left.
Listen, you can't mention any of this to Elaine.
Cynthia will kill me.
We made a deal.
Oh, my God.
He was uncomfortable because it was our first time.
So he felt he'd perform better if we did it in the kitchen.
-What?
-He says the kitchen is the most sociable room in the house.
And he was serious.
-So how was it?
-How good could it be?
My head was on a hot plate.
I got another call.
Must be Jerry.
-Oh, don't you tell him any of this.
-Yeah, okay.
-Hello?
-So, what did she say?
-What did he have to say?
-He said he had a good time.
-Her too.
-Oh, good.
-Anything else?
-No.
-You?
-No.
-You sure?
-Yeah.
-You?
-Yeah.
All right, well.
I guess everything is under control.
Yeah.
Okay then.
Alrighty.
-Good night.
-Good night.
I left three messages.
I can't believe this woman.
We have sex, she leaves 10 minutes later, then I never hear from her again.
What kind of a person does this?
She used me.
I feel cheap and violated.
-I'm gonna do something about this.
-What are you gonna do?
Never mind.
Disgraceful.
Leaves you sitting there on the kitchen floor like some kind of roach trap.
Wham, bam, thank you, ma'am.
Sir.
Whatever.
She's not gonna get away with this.
I keep racking my brain to try to figure out what I did.
I was smart.
I was funny.
I made great small talk with the waitress so she could see I could relate to the commoners.
I'm a man of the people.
-I'm gonna call her.
-Don't call.
-No, I'm calling her.
-No, Jerry, I don't want you to.
-Get away from me.
-Give me the phone.
-You wanna fight me?
-Jerry, I'm gonna kill you.
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, come on, Jerry, George.
Stop it.
I'll just call her when you leave.
It's none of your business!
-lt is so my business.
-Give me that!
Stop it, boys!
I don't want another word from either of you.
-Tell him-- -Hey, hey, hey!
The next one of you that opens your mouth, you'll have to deal with me.
I bet I know what this is about.
It's about a woman, isn't it?
-Yeah, but-- -You see!
This is exactly what they want to do to you.
They play one against the other.
You can't let them manipulate you like that.
-But, Kramer-- -No, no, no!
I want you guys to shake hands.
Come on, there are plenty women out there for all of us.
Shake.
Yes!
You see?
Isn't that better than fighting?
Animosity?
You wanna fight with somebody, you fight with me.
By the way, those condoms I gave you?
They're defective.
Don't use them.
-What?
-Yeah.
-Defective?
-Defective.
How could you give me a defective condom?
I didn't even know they were defective.
-Didn't think you'd use them.
-What do you mean--?
!
Take it easy.
Just spread out!
Don't worry.
If anything was wrong, she'd have called you.
I missed my period.
Oh, my God!
I am very worried.
I am never late.
But he used a condom, right?
I know, but these things aren't always foolproof.
Oh, no.
What?
Was it blue?
Yeah.
How'd you know?
Just a hunch.
It says "twist-off".
Twist off!
Twist!
Off!
Oh, hi.
Soda?
No, thanks.
So tell me.
What's the problem with your little flaky friend?
She doesn't return calls?
Who are you to talk about her like that?
She'll call him when she's good and ready.
-You don't even know her.
-Oh, I know her.
I know her type.
Her type?
What type?
The type that doesn't return calls.
I knew we shouldn't have done it.
It was a bad idea.
I told you.
You told me?
You pushed this whole thing on me.
It was your idea.
I was just helping your bitter, twisted friend.
She's not bitter.
Bitter's a judgment call.
She's twisted.
Twisted?
God, I did you a favour!
You said they had a good time.
What else are you keeping from me?
-Are you calling me a liar?
-I'm calling you one if you are.
-Are you?
-Get your finger out of my face.
-Get yours out.
-I don't care.
Get out!
Out!
Out!
Out!
Hey, hey, hey!
Come on, stop it!
Come on.
Break it up!
Hey, hey!
What's the matter with you?
Now, don't you two see that you're in love with each other?
I mean, why can't you face that already?
You're running around looking for something not even there when everything you dream of is right here in front of you.
Now why can't you admit that?
By the way, when you see George, give him these.
These'll work.
I knew those condoms were defective!
How did you know they were defective?
!
Because!
Because she missed her period!
She missed her period?
Oh, my God!
I can't believe it.
I'm a father!
I did it!
My boys can swim!
I can do it!
I can do it!
I'm a father!
So he shows up.
He's all out of breath.
He's dishevelled.
And tells me that whatever happens, whatever I decide is fine with him and I could depend on him and that he'd support me in whatever way I need.
Elaine, I was speechless.
Wow.
Wow.
You see?
You think you know somebody.
I said to him, "l really appreciate this, but I just got my period".
-Yeah.
-So I asked him to come in-- -Hi.
-Oh, hi.
Sorry we're late.
We got so hung up in traffic.
I'm sorry.
-What happened?
-Acting.
-Very mature.
-Thank you.
-Hi, Cynthia.
-Hi.
This is a great place to sit you got here.
Best seat in the house.
Right next to the kitchen.
Oh, stop it.
Stop it.
-So, what are these?
-We ordered appetizers.
Start eating.
Oh, fabulous.
This is good.
Oh, this is good.
Is that salt on this?
Is there salt on this?
But have you ever fixed anybody up?
Why do we do it?
Why?
You thought they'd have a good time and a little power trip for you, isn't it?
Now you're playing God.
Of course, God was the first person to fix people up.
He fixed up Adam and Eve.
I'm sure he said to Adam, "No, she's nice.
She's-- Yes, she's very free about her body.
Doesn't really wear much.
She was going out with a snake.
I think that's over, though".

{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
At the health club, people are working out and they're training, getting in shape but strangely, nobody's really getting in shape for anything.
The only reason that you're getting in shape is that so you can get through the workout.
So we're working out so that we'll be in shape for when we have to do our exercise.
This is the whole thing.
The other thing I don't get is why we're so careful about locking up our dirty towels and smelly jockstraps.
What exactly is the black market on these disgusting gym clothes?
I'll give my car to any guy in front of a restaurant because he's got a short red jacket.
"He must be the valet guy".
But my stinking, putrefied gym clothes I got one of these locks you could put a bullet through it and it won't open.
That stuff is safe.
Wide open!
I was wide-open underneath.
I had three inches on that guy.
See, you two were hogging the ball.
Me?
It wasn't me.
I never even saw the ball.
All you do is dribble.
I have to dribble.
If I give it to you, you just shoot.
You're a chucker.
-Oh, I'm a chucker.
-That's right.
Every time you get the ball, you shoot.
I can't believe you called me a chucker.
No way I'm a chucker!
I do not chuck.
Never chuck!
Never have chucked!
Never will chuck!
No chuck!
You chuck.
-Kramer, am I a chucker?
-Oh, you're a chucker.
My God, I'm a chucker.
-All these years, you never told me?
-It's not an easy thing to bring up.
Hey, you know, this is the first time we ever saw each other naked?
Believe me, I didn't see anything.
Oh, you didn't sneak a peek?
-No.
Did you?
-Yeah, I snuck a peek.
-Why?
-Why not?
What about you, George?
Yeah, l snuck a peek.
But it was so fast, I didn't see anything.
It was just a blur.
I made a conscious effort not to look.
There's certain information I just don't wanna have.
Okay.
I gotta go meet Newman.
-I'll see you later.
Have a good one.
-All right.
Yeah.
Look at this guy.
Does he have to stretch in here?
-You know who that is?
-Who?
That's Keith Hernandez.
Keith Hernandez, the baseball player?
Yeah, that's him.
-Are you sure?
-Positive.
Wow!
Keith Hernandez!
-He's such a great player.
-Yeah.
He's a real smart guy too.
He's a Civil War buff.
Wow, I'd love to be a Civil War buff.
What do you have to do to become a buff?
So Biff wants to be a buff?
Well, sleeping less than 1 8 hours a day would be a start.
I only got two weeks left of unemployment.
I gotta prove I've been looking for a job to get an extension.
Hey, should we say something to him?
Oh, I'm sure he loves to hear from fans in the locker room.
Well, he could say hello to me.
I wouldn't mind.
He's Keith Hernandez.
You're Jerry Seinfeld.
-So?
-What, you're comparing yourself to Keith Hernandez?
The guy's a baseball player, Jerry, baseball!
I know what he is.
I recognized him.
You didn't even notice him.
What, you're making some wisecracks in a nightclub?
The guy was in game six, two runs down, two outs, facing elimination!
Excuse me.
I don't want to disturb you.
I'm Keith Hernandez.
And I just want to tell you what a big fan I am.
I love your comedy.
-Really?
-I've always wanted to do what you do.
Do what I do?
!
You're one of my favorite ballplayers of all time!
Mine too.
-I love that bit about Jimmy Olsen.
-Really?
Thank you.
You know, Keith, what I've always wondered is with all these ball clubs flying around all season wouldn't you think there'd be a plane crash?
Are you performing in New York now?
At this club on the East Side.
You should come in.
But think about it: You'd think eventually, an entire team would just get wiped out.
I live on the East Side.
I'll give you my number and just tell me whenever you want to go.
-Or maybe just get together for coffee.
-Oh, that'd be great.
Well, it's only a matter of time.
Who's this chucker?
It's been three days, and he hasn't called.
Well, maybe you should call him.
I can't.
I can't.
-Why not?
-I just feel like he should call me.
What's the difference?
You don't understand, Elaine.
I don't want to be overanxious.
If he wants to see me, he has my number.
He should call.
God, look at this ashtray.
I hate cigarettes.
I can't stand these guys.
You give your number to them, and then they don't call.
Why do they do that?
I'm sorry, honey.
I mean, I really thought he liked me.
We were getting along.
He came over to me.
I didn't go over to him.
-I know.
-Why did he come over to me?
I mean, here I meet this great guy, this ballplayer -best guy I ever met.
-Yeah.
I know.
Well, that's it.
I'm never giving my number out to another guy again.
I've given my number out to guys, and it takes them a month to call.
Good.
Good.
Well, if he's calling in a month he's got a prayer.
You know, maybe he's been busy.
Maybe he's been out of town.
Oh, what, they don't have phones out of town?
I love how people say they're too busy.
"Too busy".
Pick up a phone!
Takes two minutes.
How can you be too busy?
-Why don't you just go and call him?
-I can't call here.
It's a coffee shop.
-I mean, what am I gonna say to him?
-Just ask if he wants to get together.
For what, dinner?
Dinner's good.
Don't you think that's coming on a little too strong?
Isn't that, like, a turnoff?
Jerry, he's a guy.
I know, but this is all very confusing.
When you're in your 30s, it's very hard to make a new friend.
Whatever the group is you've got now, that's who you're going with.
You're not interviewing, not looking at any new people.
You're not interested in seeing any applications.
They don't know the places.
They don't know the foods.
They don't know the activities.
If I meet a guy at a club or a gym: "Hey, look, I'm sure you're very nice.
You seem to have a lot of potential.
We're just not hiring right now".
When you're a kid you can be friends with anybody.
Remember when you're a little kid what are the qualifications?
"lf someone's in front of my house that's my friend.
They're my friend.
That's it.
Are you a grownup?
No?
Great.
Come on in!
Let's jump up and down on my bed"!
And if you have anything in common: "You like cherry soda?
I like cherry soda!
We'll be best friends"!
You only have two more weeks before your benefits run out.
Yes, and I was hoping, perhaps, to get a 13-week extension, if that's possible.
So where have you been looking for work?
You know what I've discovered, Mrs. Sokol?
It's not so much the looking as the listening.
I listen for work.
As I'm looking and listening-- I'm also looking.
You cannot discount looking.
It's a combination.
It's looking.
And listening.
Listening.
And looking.
But you must look.
Can you be specific about any of these companies?
Specific.
Let's see.
I've walked in and out of so many buildings.
They all blend in together.
Just give me one name.
One name.
Absolutely.
Let's see, there's.
Vandalay lndustries.
I just saw them.
I got very close there.
Very close.
What type of company is that?
Latex.
Latex manufacturing, Mrs. Sokol.
-And you interviewed there?
-Yes, for a sales position.
Latex salesman.
The selling of latex and latex-related products.
They just wouldn't give me a chance.
Damn it!
Now I'm going to need an address and a phone number for this Vandalay company.
You like gum?
Because I have a friend in the gum business.
I got a gum guy!
I make one phone call, have boxes of gum delivered right to your door.
The address?
The address is.
Jose Jimenez.
Do you recognize that?
-No.
-Jose Jimenez.
Very funny.
Really, he's very funny.
The address.
Vandalay is 129 West 81st Street.
It's a very small industry, Vandalay.
It's why I wanted to work for them.
A phone number.
That'sKL5 8383.
Are you planning on calling them soon?
Because they have very strange hours.
As soon as I'm done with you.
Sure.
Well.
You know, I'll check in with you next week.
I gotta run now because I got a full plate this afternoon.
-Okay.
-All right.
Really good to.
He'll call you back!
It's a par five.
So, you know, I step up to the tee and I hit a beautiful drive right down the middle of the fairway.
-I mean, you know my hook, right?
-Elaine?
How about this shirt?
Is this okay?
Jerry, he's a guy.
Well, it's a dogleg left, so I play the hook.
Wait, hold on.
There's another call.
-Jerry!
Jerry!
-George?
-Kramer, put Jerry on!
-I'm in the middle of something.
-Call back.
-Kramer, no--!
So the ball takes off, and I'm waiting for it to turn.
Would you--!
All right.
Well, I'll talk to Jerry.
Yeah.
Hey, that was Michael and Carol.
She's wondering when we'll go see the baby.
-See the baby.
Again with the baby.
-Who are they?
A guy who used to live in the building keeps calling us to see the baby.
"You gotta see the baby.
When are you gonna see the baby"?
Can't they just send us a tape?
Maybe if you wait a few months, it won't be a baby anymore.
-Then you won't have to see it.
-Because he'll be all grown-up.
Yeah.
Hey, Kramer, what do you think of this shirt?
It's too busy.
You're trying too hard to make an impression on him.
-You're not being yourself.
-What guy?
I know he's just a guy, but I really like him.
Who are you talking about?
KeithHernandez.
Keith Hernandez?
Keith Hernandez!
Do me a favor, would you?
Would you change lanes?
You gotta get out of this lane.
This lane stinks.
They're all double-parked.
Get out, I'm begging you.
Please.
Please!
You know what?
Bad mistake.
My mistake.
Go back.
Your lane was better.
Forget this lane.
This lane stinks.
Go back to your lane.
Go ahead.
Bad mistake.
Go!
Go!
Go!
Make this light!
Make this light!
Oh, man!
That's it!
Get out!
-What do you mean, get out?
-Get out of the cab!
What?
I'm not getting out of this cab.
No!
No!
You cannot throw me out!
No!
Get.
Hello, Newman.
I hate Keith Hernandez.
-Hate him!
-I despise him.
-Why?
-Why?
I'll tell you why.
-Let me tell her.
-No, you can't-- -You always tell.
-All right, tell it.
-Just tell it.
-All right.
June 14th, 1987, Mets-Phillies.
We're enjoying a beautiful afternoon in the right-field stands when a crucial Hernandez error opens the door to a five-run Phillies ninth.
Cost the Mets the game!
Our day was ruined.
There was a lot of people waiting by the players' parking lot.
Now we're coming down the ramp.
Newman was in front of me.
Hernandez was coming toward us.
As he passes us, Newman turns and says, "Nice game, pretty boy".
Hernandez continued past us up the ramp.
Then, a second later, something happened that changed us in a very deep and profound way from that day forward.
-What was it?
-He spit on us!
And I screamed out, "I'm hit"!
Then I turned, and the spit ricocheted off him, and it hit me.
What a story.
Unfortunately, the immutable laws of physics contradict the whole premise of your account.
Allow me to reconstruct this, if I may, for Ms. Benes as I've heard this story a number of times.
Newman, Kramer, if you'll indulge me.
According to your story Hernandez passes you and starts walking up the ramp.
Then you say you were struck on the right temple.
The spit then proceeds to ricochet off the temple, striking Newman between the third and the fourth rib.
The spit then came off the rib made a right turn, hitting Newman in the right wrist causing him to drop his baseball cap.
The spit then splashed off the wrist, pauses in midair, mind you makes a left turn and lands on Newman's left thigh.
That is one magic loogie.
Well, that's the way it happened.
What happened to your head when you got hit?
Well, my head went back, to the left.
-Say that again.
-Back and to the left.
Back and to the left.
Back and to the left.
So, what are you saying?
I'm saying that the spit could not have come from behind.
That there had to have been a second spitter.
Behind the bushes, on the gravelly road.
If the spitter was behind you, as you claim that would've caused your head to pitch forward.
So the spit could've only come from the front and to the right.
But that's not what they would have you believe.
I'm leaving.
Jerry's a nut.
Wait, wait, wait.
The sad thing is, we may never know the real truth.
Did anybody call asking for Vandalay lndustries?
-No, what happened to you?
-All right, listen closely: I was at the unemployment office.
I told them I was very close to getting a job with Vandalay lndustries and I gave them your phone number.
So when the phone rings you have to answer, "Vandalay lndustries".
-I'm Vandalay lndustries?
-Right.
-What is that?
-You're in latex.
-Latex?
-Right.
-What do I do with latex?
-I don't know!
You manufacture it!
-Right here in this little apartment?
-And what do I say about you?
You're considering hiring me for your latex salesman.
-I'll hire you as my latex salesman?
-Right.
I don't think so.
Why would I do that?
Because I asked you to.
If you think I'm looking for someone to just sit pushing papers around, you can forget it.
I've got enough headaches just trying to manufacture the stuff.
-Yeah?
-It's Keith.
All right, we're coming down.
Keith Hernandez?
-Yeah.
Come on, Elaine, let's go.
-Where are you going?
They're giving me a ride downtown.
You know, there had to have been a second spitter.
Who was it?
Who had the motive?
That's what I've been trying to figure out the past five years.
What the hell are you two talking about?
-That was really fun.
Thanks.
-Yeah, it really was.
Should I shake his hand?
Well.
You want to catch a movie this weekend?
Have you seen JFK?
No, I haven't.
This weekend.
Wow!
Sure.
That would be great.
Damn.
I was too overanxious.
He must have noticed that.
I mean, if you want to.
-Well, how about this Friday?
-Yeah, Friday's okay.
Go ahead, shake his hand.
I'm Jerry Seinfeld.
I've been on The Tonight Show.
Well, good night.
Good night.
Oh, Jer, by the way the woman we gave a ride to earlier.
-Elaine.
-Yeah.
-What's her story?
-I don't know.
We used to go out.
Would you mind if I gave her a call?
-For a date?
-Yeah.
Oh, no.
Go ahead.
You got a pen?
You sure you don't mind?
So then we went to dinner.
-Who paid?
-We split it.
Split it.
Pretty good.
-Did you talk about game six?
-No.
I gotta wait until it's the right time.
-Yeah?
-It's Elaine.
Come on up.
So then what?
Nothing.
Then he took me home.
Shake his hand?
Yeah.
What kind of a shake does he have?
Good shake.
Perfect shake.
Single pump, not too hard.
Didn't have to prove anything, but firm enough to know he was there.
So you're gonna see him again?
He asked me if I was doing anything Friday night.
The weekend!
So then, as I was getting out of the car-- -Hi!
-Oh, hi, Elaine.
Hi, Elaine.
So how was your date?
What date?
It's a guy.
So you know.
He called me.
-Already?
-Keith called you?
This guy really gets around.
-Do you mind?
-No, I don't mind.
Why should I mind?
What did he say?
He asked me out for Saturday night.
-You going?
-No.
-I told him I was busy.
-Oh, really?
So we're going out Friday.
-Friday?
-Yeah.
He's going out with you on Friday?
-Yeah?
-He's supposed to see me on Friday.
-I didn't know.
-We made plans!
-Well-- I'll cancel it.
-No, don't cancel it.
Well, this is a little awkward, isn't it?
Well, frankly, it is.
I've never seen you jealous before.
Well, you're not even a fan.
I was at game six.
You didn't even watch it.
Wait a second.
Wait a minute.
Are you jealous of him or are you jealous of me?
Any Hennigan's around here?
Vandalay lndustries.
Kell Varnsen speaking.
May we help you?
Oh, hi, Keith.
No, I was just joking around.
No, no, I don't mind at all.
-No, no, no.
I can cancel.
-Sure.
We'll do something next week.
No, it's no problem at all.
Okay.
Take it easy.
That was Keith.
We're gonna do something next week.
Hey, what are you doing Friday night?
Friday night?
Nothing.
Now.
Want to come to see the baby?
Oh, fasten your seat belts.
We're going to see the baby.
If you don't see the baby now, you're never gonna see her.
-All right, I'll go.
-All right.
All right.
I'll get it.
Hello.
What-delay lndustries?
-No!
-Vandalay!
Say Vandalay!
No, you're way, way, way off!
Yeah, that's the right number, but this is an apartment.
-No, say-- -Vandalay!
Say-- Vandalay lndustries!
Yeah, no problem, no problem.
How did you know who they wanted?
!
And you want to be my latex salesman.
Just sign here, please.
I know who it was too.
It was the guy that interviewed me.
He was very threatened by me.
Why else wouldn't he hire me?
-I could sell latex like that.
-Just sign that.
-Who is this?
-It's my daughter.
This is your daughter?
My God!
My God!
I hope you don't mind my saying, she is breathtaking.
You think so?
Would you take this picture away from me?
Just take it away.
Get it out of here.
Take it away, and put it away.
Let me just sign this and go.
You know she doesn't even have a boyfriend.
Okay.
Okay.
Who do you think you're talking to?
You trying to make a joke, Mrs. Sokol?
It's not funny.
I can tell you that.
I'm serious.
She doesn't.
You know, it's one thing to not give me the extension.
But to tease and to torture me like this there's no call for that.
Would you like her phone number?
Mrs. Sokol, I don't know what to say.
-Where should I sign this thing?
-No, no, no, no.
Don't worry about it.
Unemployment, it's a tough thing.
Even if you get a job after you've been unemployed they take unemployment out of your check every week and show it to you in that little box.
How good can it be for your confidence that every paycheck has the word "unemployment" on it?
Can't get it out of your mind!
You just got the job!
They're already getting ready for you to be laid off.
I have a friend who's unemployed.
He's collecting unemployment insurance.
This guy has never worked this hard in his life to keep this thing going.
He's down there every week waiting on the lines and getting interviewed and making up all these lies about looking for jobs.
If they had any idea the effort and energy that he is expending to avoid work, I'm sure they'd give him a raise.
I'm sure of it.
The guy is doing a tremendous job not working.
So tell me more about this game six.
Well, there was two outs, bottom of the tenth.
We're one out away from losing the series.
Hello.
How are you?
So, what do you think?
Do you love her?
Yes, I do love her.
You have a very nice place here.
So who do you think she looks like?
Lyndon Johnson.
What?
Lyndon Johnson?
He's joking.
No, I'm not joking.
She looks like Lyndon Johnson.
Jerry, I can't believe it took you so long to see the baby.
I kept saying to Michael, "When is Jerry going to see the baby"?
I was saying the same thing.
Take a picture.
Michael, get the camera.
-You don't have to take a picture.
-I don't know where it is.
It's in the bottom drawer of our dresser.
Hurry up!
He's such an idiot.
Jerry, you want to pick her up?
-I better not.
-I'll pick her up.
No!
Thank you for a wonderful time, George.
Glad you enjoyed it.
I haven't had a Big Mac in a long time.
Billions and billions.
Would you like to come up?
Would I like to come up?
I would love to come up.
I'mI'm fighting not to.
Fighting.
Unfortunately, l have to get an early start tomorrow.
Gotta get up and hit that pavement.
But it's Saturday.
All the offices are closed.
I got me an appointment with a hardware store.
I'm not saying I want to do it for the rest of my life but hardware fascinates me.
Wouldn't you love to make a key?
Will you call me as soon as you get home?
-Tonight?
-Yes.
Will I call you when I get home?
What do you think?
You kill me.
You really kill me.
Well, good night.
It was an accident.
Right, Jerry?
It was an accident.
Oh, she's gonna be all right.
Here, baby.
Here.
Here, baby.
Baby, baby, baby.
Who's the baby?
I have a friend who's got a baby.
"Gotta see the baby.
You've got to come over and see the baby".
Nobody ever wants you to come over and see their grandfather, do they?
"You've got to see my grandfather.
You've got to see him.
He's so cute.
I love them when they're this age.
He's 1000 months.
You know, the mid-80s is such a good time for the grand-people.
The mid-80s, you gotta see them.
He went to the bathroom by himself today".
You know what's tough about seeing people when they have a baby is that you have to match their level of enthusiasm.
You know what I mean?
They're always so excited.
"What do you think of him"?
I'd like to meet a couple that goes: "You know, we're not that happy with him, frankly.
I think we really made a big mistake.
We should have got an aquarium.
You want him?
We don't even want him.
You want him"?
Thanks for a nice evening.
This was really fun.
Yeah, it was.
Gosh, should I kiss her good night?
Is he going to try and kiss me?
-I love Cajun cooking.
-Really?
You know, my mom's one-quarter Cajun.
Oh, my father's half-drunk.
Maybe they should get together.
Go ahead.
Kiss her.
I'm a baseball player, damn it.
What's he waiting for?
I thought he was a cool guy.
Come on.
I won the MVP in '79.
I can do whatever I want to.
Well, this is getting awkward.
Well, good night.
Good night.
Who does this guy think he is?
I'm Keith Hernandez.
Who else?
Mookie.
Mookie was there.
You know him?
Well, I don't know him.
I know who he is.
He's such a great guy.
You should meet him.
-He's the one who got that hit-- -I know.
He got the hit in game six!
So then what happened?
Nothing.
Then he took me home.
So did you two have?
What?
You know.
Milk?
-No.
-Cookies?
Did he kiss you good night?
I don't know.
What do you mean, you don't know?
All right.
He kissed me, okay?
Well, what kind of a kiss?
Was it a peck?
Was it a kiss?
Was it a long make-out thing?
Between a peck and a make-out.
So you like him.
I don't understand.
Before you were jealous of me.
Now you're jealous of him?
I'm jealous of everybody.
Hello.
Oh, hi.
What's happening?
What?
Sure.
Yeah, okay.
Then.
I'll see you then.
Yeah, yeah.
Okay.
Bye.
-Who was that?
-That was Keith.
-What's going on?
-He wants me to help him move.
Help him move?
Move what?
You know, furniture.
So, what did you say?
I said, yes, but I don't feel right about it.
I mean, I hardly know the guy.
That's a big step in a male relationship.
The biggest.
That's like going all the way.
And you feel you're not really ready for-- Well, we went out one time.
Don't you think that's coming on a little too strong?
Hey.
What's going on?
Keith Hernandez just asked me to help him move.
What?
Well, you hardly know the guy.
What a nerve!
You see?
Wasn't I right about this guy?
Didn't I tell you?
Oh, you're not gonna do it, are you?
-I said, yes.
-You said yes?
!
Don't you have any pride or self-respect?
I mean, how can you prostitute yourself like this?
Are you gonna start driving him to the airport?
I'm not driving him to the airport.
Oh, boy.
I don't know.
-Kramer, do me a favor, would you?
-What?
Don't mention it to anybody.
I wish you never mentioned it to me.
I had a great time tonight, Carrie.
And I will call you as soon as I get home.
Don't bother.
Bother?
What kind of bother?
I would prefer it if you didn't.
-Why?
Is anything wrong?
-It's over, buddy.
Done.
Finished.
So long.
Goodbye.
Adios.
Sayonara.
-Why?
-I've been thinking about it.
You got no job.
You got no prospects.
You're like Biff Loman.
I went to the hardware store interview.
You think I'm going to spend my life with somebody because he can get me a deal on a box of nails?
I thought we were a team.
If I ever need a drill bit, I'll call you.
Carrie, could you do me a favor?
Could you not mention this to your mother?
You know, I hate to brag but I did win 1 1 straight Gold Gloves.
I wouldn't have brought it up, but since you mentioned it.
I didn't mention it.
Well, I won them anyway.
Well, so what?
I mean you played first base.
I mean, they always put the worst player at first base.
That's where they put me, and I stunk.
Elaine, you don't know the first thing about first base.
Well, I know something about getting to first base and I know you'll never be there.
The way I figure it, I've already been there.
And I plan on rounding second tonight at around 1 1 :00.
Well, I'd watch the third-base coach if I were you because I don't think he's waving you in.
You know, I hate to say this but I really think that we're hitting it off.
-Get it?
Get it?
-Clever.
-What are you doing?
-What's that?
-You smoke?
-Yeah.
I didn't know you smoked.
Is that a problem?
She likes him.
I mean, she really likes him.
-How do you know?
-Who wouldn't like him?
I like him, and I'm a guy.
I suppose he's an attractive man.
Forget that.
He's a ballplayer.
MVP, 1979.
I'm making wisecracks in some nightclub.
This guy was in game six.
They're a perfect match.
They go together.
Like one of these brother and sister couples that look alike.
I hate those couples.
I could never be one of those couples.
There are no bald women around, you know.
I know this sounds a little arrogant, but I never thought she'd find someone she liked better than me.
But, you know I guess I had my chance.
And that's that.
You know what I'd like to do?
I'd really like to have sex with a tall woman.
I mean really tall, like a giant.
Like 6'5".
Really?
What was the tallest woman you ever slept with?
I don't know, 6'3".
Wow!
God!
See, this is all I think about: sleeping with a giant.
It's my life's ambition.
So I guess it's fair to say you've set different goals for yourself than say, Thomas Edison, Magellan, these type of people.
Magellan?
You like Magellan?
Oh, yeah.
My favorite explorer.
Around the world.
Come on.
-Who do you like?
-I like de Soto.
-De Soto?
What did he do?
-Discovered the Mississippi.
Oh, like they wouldn't have found that anyway.
All right.
I gotta go down to the unemployment office.
-You want to take a walk?
-No, I got some stuff to do.
I gotta meet Keith at my apartment at 3.
I'm helping him move.
What?
The guy asked you to help him move?
Wow!
-I know.
Isn't that something?
-Why doesn't he just pay a mover?
He's got some valuable antiques.
He's worried they'll break something.
Soon he'll have you driving him to the airport.
I'm not driving him to the airport!
I gave.
I gave everything I could, Mrs. Sokol.
-Nothing was good enough for her.
-Sign here, please.
I don't know who she's looking for.
I don't know.
I'll tell you, she's very particular, your daughter.
Very particular.
Is she looking for some big hotshot businessman?
Well, I've got my pride too.
I'm not gonna beg her.
All right.
Just sign it.
People are waiting.
You like baseball?
That was autographed by the '86 Mets.
I saw every inning that year.
It's funny, because I happen to be very good friends with Keith Hernandez.
You know Keith Hernandez.
Know him?
Would youIike to meet him?
Oh, come on.
Come on.
I can produce Keith Hernandez, right here within the hour.
All right.
You got one hour.
All right, Mrs. S. I and my good pal Keith Hernandez will be right back.
Or not.
You better bring your gloves.
It's freezing out there.
It shouldn't take too long.
I'd say maybe, oh, four hours.
Really, Jerry, there's not that much.
First, we got the bedroom.
We got two dressers and the bed.
-ls there a box spring?
-What's that?
-A box spring?
-Yeah, there's a box spring.
But it's attached to the headboard, and we'll have to take that apart.
Then we got the couch.
-ls that a sectional?
-Yeah, 12 pieces.
-A marble coffee table.
-ls that a thick marble?
Three inches thick.
Got it in ltaly.
But the big problem is gonna be the convertible sofa.
When you move it, it tends to open up so it's going to be difficult getting it downstairs.
Stairs?
-There's no elevator?
-No, it's a brownstone.
Three floors.
-I'm sorry, I can't do this.
-What?
I can't do it!
I can't!
It's too soon.
I don't know you.
I can't help you move, I'm sorry.
I can't!
I just can't.
-Hello.
-Hello.
Oh, you don't remember me.
-No.
Should l?
-Yeah, yeah, you should because I certainly remember you.
Let me refresh your memory.
June 14th, 1987.
Mets-Phillies.
You made a big error.
Cost the Mets the game.
Then you're coming up the parking lot ramp.
You said, "Nice game, pretty boy".
-You remember.
-And then you spit on us.
-Hey, I didn't spit at you.
-Yeah, right.
-No, no.
Then who was it?
-Look, the way I remember it I was walking up the ramp.
I was upset about the game.
That's when you called me "pretty boy.
" Hey, that ticked me off.
I was turning to say something and as I turned around I saw Roger McDowell behind the bushes over by that gravelly road.
Anyway, he was talking to someone, and they were pointing at you.
I tried to scream out, but it was too late.
It was already on its way.
I told you.
-It was McDowell.
-But why?
Why McDowell?
Maybe because we were sitting in the right-field stands cursing at him in the bullpen all game.
He must have caught a glimpse of us when I poured that beer on his head.
-lt was McDowell.
-Oh, boy.
-Look, Keith, we're sorry.
-Yeah, I couldn't be sorrier.
Guys, don't worry about it.
-Well, I guess I better get going.
-What are you doing?
-I gotta move.
-You want any help?
-I'd love some.
You sure?
-I'd love to help you.
Yeah, me too!
Okay, guys.
We got to be careful of one thing.
Some of the stuff is very fragile We'll have to handle it like a baby.
Hey, no sweat.
Hello.
Oh, hi, Elaine.
What's going on?
No, he just left.
You broke up with him?
Me too!
What happened?
Oh, smoking.
You know, you're like going out with C. Everett Koop.
Me?
No.
I couldn't go through with it.
I just didn't feel ready.
So, what are you doing now?
Oh, great idea.
Okay.
I'll meet you there in, like, Okay, bye.
Keith!
Keith!
-What happened?
Where's Keith?
-You just missed him.
He just left.
What do you need him for?
Keith!
Keith!
Up here!
Look, could you do me a favor?
I need you to go to the unemployment office with me!
I-- I'm Jerry's friend!
The guy from the locker room!
I'm the chucker!
It'll take five minutes!
Wait!
Wait!
Well, Biff what's next?
I don't know.
Excuse me.
I was walking behind you, and you dropped your wallet.
When you're moving, your whole world becomes boxes.
That's all you think about, is boxes.
Where are there boxes?
You just wander down the street, going in and out of stores.
"Are there boxes here?
Have you seen any boxes"?
I mean, you can't even talk to people because you can't concentrate.
"Shut up!
I'm looking for boxes"!
So after a while, you become really into it.
You can smell them.
You walk into a store: "There's boxes here.
Don't tell me you don't have boxes.
Damn it!
I can smell them"!
You become, like, obsessed.
"l love the smell of cardboard in the morning".
At a funeral, everyone's crying around.
You're looking at the casket: "That's a nice box.
Does anybody know where that guy got that box?
When he's done with it, you think I could get that?
It's got some nice handles on it".
And that's what death is, really.
It's the last big move of your life.
The hearse is like the van.
The pallbearers are close friends.
The only ones you could really ask to help you with a big move like that.
And the casket is that great, perfect box you've been looking for your whole life.
The only problem is once you find it, you're in it.
SDl Media Group
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Do you think that the people at the airport that run the stores have any idea what the prices are everyplace else in the world or do they just feel they have their own little country out there and they can charge anything they want?
"You hungry?
Tuna sandwich is $9.
You don't like it, go back to your own country".
I think the whole airport-airline complex is a huge scam just to sell the tuna sandwiches.
I think that profit is what's supporting the whole air travel industry.
I mean, think about it.
The terminals, the airplanes it's all just a distraction so that you don't notice the beating that you're taking on the tuna.
It's all departures.
I see nothing but departures.
Do you know where the arrivals are?
Excuse me, sir, do you have the time?
There's a clock over there.
-Where?
-Over there.
-But you have a watch on.
-It's right by the escalator.
Why not just look at your watch?
I told you, it's right over there.
-Let me see the watch.
-Hey!
What are you, some kind of nut?
You know, we're living in a society!
-George.
-Jerry, Jerry.
The flight was delayed.
How long you been here?
I just got here.
My car broke down on the Belt Parkway.
I can't believe-- Get rid of that piece of junk.
One mile from the exit, it starts shaking, violently shaking Iike it's having a nervous breakdown.
-Then it completely stopped dead.
-So you have no car.
-No.
-So, what good are you?
This chauffeur's gonna be waiting a while.
-O'Brien's not showing up.
-How do you know?
He was in Chicago.
Flight was overbooked.
They wouldn't let him on.
He kept screaming how he had to get to Madison Square Garden.
-We should take his limo.
-Yeah, right.
Wait a second.
Think about it.
He's not showing up.
Wait till you see the line for cabs.
It's 45 minutes long.
-You said he's in Chicago.
-He's definitely in Chicago.
Well, that guy is just standing there.
-How would we do it?
-Just go up and say, "We're O'Brien".
-Maybe he knows O'Brien.
-He doesn't know him.
If he knew O'Brien, he wouldn't have a sign.
-Let's just do it.
-What if we get caught?
What's gonna happen?
They can't kill us.
-Who's gonna be O'Brien?
-I'll be O'Brien.
-Who am l?
-You're you.
-Just me?
-Yeah.
-Okay.
-You don't wanna be you?
Well, if you're gonna be O'Brien, why can't I be somebody?
-Like who?
-Dylan Murphy.
Okay.
-Now you wanna be Dylan Murphy?
-Well, I like Dylan.
You could be Colin.
Okay.
Colin O'Brien.
-I'm Dylan Murphy.
-I'm Colin O'Brien.
-Are we really doing this?
-Come on.
-Hey, do you have the time?
-Clock over there.
-O'Brien.
-Yes, sir.
Sorry we're late.
-Let me take that for you.
-Oh, thank you.
-I'll bring the car around front.
-Thank you very much.
-Dylan.
-Colin.
Can you believe this?
This is incredible.
This is one of the greatest things I've ever done.
-I'm gonna call my mother.
-What for?
To tell her I'm in a limo.
Hello, Ma?
It's me.
Guess where I am.
In the back of a limo.
No, nobody died.
It's a long story.
I can't tell you now.
Because I can't.
I said, I can't.
If I could, I would.
Would you stop it?
All right, look-- I'm getting off.
No, I'm not telling you.
How's this?
I'm never telling you.
I don't care.
No!
Fine!
Never!
She happy for you?
-Can he hear us?
-No.
Why?
Thought I saw him look in the mirror suspiciously.
He can't hear us.
Let's test him.
Hey, driver.
What do you say we stop off, pick up your sister have a little fun back here?
No.
He can't hear us.
Where's he dropping us?
Maybe we can get him to drop us at my house.
I'll ask him.
My dear fellow, where are you dropping us?
At Madison Square Garden, of course.
I have the four passes.
Of course, the four passes.
Four passes to Madison Square Garden?
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Of course.
Chicago!
The Knicks are playing the Bulls tonight!
-What?
-We are going to the Knick game!
-Michael Jordan!
-The Knicks!
We're going to the game!
Four free passes!
-Did I tell you?
Did I tell you?
-I can't believe it!
-You may have hit with this one.
-You see?
You see, I see things as they are and I say, "No".
Wait.
You see things as they are not and you say-- Wait.
You see thing-- Do you see things as they are?
What do you say when you see things?
Let me call Elaine and Kramer.
If I see things as they are, I would ask, "Why"?
or "Why not"?
Elaine?
It's me.
What are you doing tonight?
Great.
George and I have tickets-- Four free passes to the Knicks-Bulls game at Madison Square Garden.
Can you go?
Great.
Call Kramer, tell him to meet us on the corner at 7:00.
All right.
We're gonna pick you up in a limo.
That's right, baby doll.
And listen, when we pick you up, I'm Murphy and George is O'Brien.
I can't tell you now.
It's a long story.
I am serious.
Okay.
Okay, bye.
Excuse me, driver, we have to make a little stop first.
I know.
-He knows?
-He knows?
Where we going?
Why are we pulling off here?
Maybe it's a shortcut.
We're on the Grand Central.
There's no traffic.
Excuse me, why are we getting off this exit?
To pick up the other members of your party.
Right.
The other members of our party.
What other members of our party?
I didn't even know we were in a party.
I'm telling you, the jig is up.
It was a bad jig.
We never should've started it.
-lt was a good jig.
-lt was a bad jig.
A terrible, terrible jig.
What are we gonna do now?
They'll know you're not O'Brien.
There could be more than one O'Brien who ordered a limo.
-First, you don't look like any O'Brien.
-You should've been O'Brien.
I don't wanna be Murphy anymore.
Do I have to be?
-Yes, you have to be Murphy.
-lt makes no sense, me being Murphy.
-You're Murphy.
-I'm Seinfeld.
You're Murphy!
Let's just jump out of the car.
We're doing 60 miles an hour.
So we jump and roll.
You won't get hurt.
Who are you, Mannix?
Why are we slowing down?
Are those the people?
All right, put your hands up over your face.
Pretend you're sleeping.
-Mr. O'Brien.
-No, I'm Dylan Murphy.
Mr. O'Brien had a long trip.
He's sleeping.
I don't wanna disturb him.
We're just really excited to meet him face-to-face finally.
We're faithful readers of his newsletter.
-Newsletter?
-And, of course, his great book The Big Game.
Oh, yes, he's very proud of his work in The Big Game.
-So you've never met him before?
-No.
-Never seen a picture of him?
-Never.
Not even on the book jacket?
There was no picture on the book jacket.
Hey, O'Brien, wake up.
Come on.
We got company.
Wake up.
Well, hello.
I'm O'Brien.
-Hey!
-Hey.
You took a cab?
Yeah.
So?
How much do you make?
-I'm not telling you.
-Come on.
-No.
-I'll tell you how much I make.
I know how much you make.
I don't even know why I'm doing this.
I don't even like basketball.
-You ever seen Michael Jordan?
-Just in those commercials.
Maybe you'll see him do one of those 360 dunks.
-What's that?
-It's like this.
-Here, you guard me.
-What?
I never get the tinted windows on the limo.
Nobody cares who's in the limo.
You see a limo go by, you know it's either a rich guy or 50 prom kids with $1.75 each.
Being in the back of a limo, I'm sorry, it's just-- It's not that cool.
Most of the time, you feel like you're in some depressing single guy's apartment from, like, 1975.
All that maroon velour furniture couple of bottles of wine, three cassette tapes.
There's stains.
You're counting, there must've been -I don't think we'll make the tip-off.
-Think someone's been tipped off?
So.
You've read The Big Game, have you?
Yes, I've read it.
And I've memorized it.
Well, tell me your impressions.
I would love to hear what a young woman thinks of The Big Game.
Well, this is sort of embarrassing.
But it's changed my life.
The way you analyse the game the way you identify the major players.
Well, it left me breathless.
You're a brilliant brilliant man.
Well, it's.
It's just a game.
Remember that, kids.
"Just a game".
He's so humble.
Don't forget what you wrote in the epilogue: "The fate of the world depends on the outcome of this game".
Well, I was exaggerating a bit.
Just for effect.
-He tends to exaggerate.
-I mean, it's serious, but-- We are really looking forward to your speech tonight.
My speech.
Yes, your secretary faxed me the copy.
Would you like to look it over?
Well, you might as well look it over.
So, what's going on?
How did all this happen?
Jerry and George called me from this limo.
They said we're all going to the Knicks-Bulls game.
Limo?
I thought that George went to pick him up.
He did.
Then why would they take a limo from the airport?
I don't know.
That's pretty strange.
Did he say anything else?
Yeah.
He said it's really important that we call them O'Brien and Murphy.
O'Brien?
Why would he wanna be called O'Brien?
"And the Jews steal our money through their Zionist-occupied government and use the black man to bring drugs into our oppressed white minority communities".
You're not gonna open with that, are you?
What was that you said about the myth of the Holocaust?
Said so many things.
They're shooting!
They're shooting!
All right, get down.
I'm ready to die for you.
Oh, that's really very nice of you, Eva, thank you.
But of course, you know, I would.
I would do anything for you.
Anything.
Nothing to worry about, it was a flat tire.
But rest assured we're prepared to handle anything that might come up.
Nice-looking Luger.
I'm at The Paramount, adjacent to Madison Square Garden where a growing number of angry demonstrators gather to protest the first public appearance of Donald O'Brien Ieader of the Midwestern regional chapter of the Aryan Union and reputed to be their most charismatic spokesman.
Mr. O'Brien advocates the violent overthrow of the government.
He has openly professed a deep admiration of Adolf Hitler.
Even David Duke has denounced him as a dangerous extremist.
There is a full house inside awaiting his arrival from the airport.
Sources tell me he is en route and should be arriving momentarily.
Police have set up barricades, but, quite frankly, Bill I don't think they're any match for the emotional fuse that has been lit.
From The Paramount, I'm Jodi Baskerville.
Back to you in the studio.
Something's very strange here.
George goes to the airport to pick up Jerry.
They come back in a limo with four tickets to the basketball game and wanna be called O'Brien and Murphy.
O'Brien.
O'Brien.
Why O'Brien?
Elaine?
-Dan.
-Excuse me a minute.
Hey.
-Hi, Dan.
How are you?
-Good.
-Oh, this is Kramer.
-Oh, Kramer.
What's going on?
We're headed down to protest this big neo-Nazi rally.
The head of the Aryan Union is speaking.
He's in from Chicago.
-You should come.
-Oh, we can't.
We're going to the Knicks-Bulls game.
Oh, well, that's where the rally is.
At The Paramount, right next door.
-Oh, well, maybe we'll run into you.
-Yeah, it's really gonna be something.
First time he's appeared in public.
No one knows what he looks like.
-Who?
-The head of the Aryan Union.
O'Brien.
What's taking them so long out there?
Did you see the way she was looking at me?
-She's a Nazi, George.
A Nazi.
-I know, I know.
Kind of a cute Nazi, though.
We gotta make a plan.
-What are we gonna do?
-I don't know.
-Let's just make a run for it.
-I can't run.
I have a bad hamstring.
-How'd that happen?
-I hurt it in a hotel room.
Know how they tuck the covers in real tight in those rooms?
I can't sleep like that.
I tried to kick it out and pulled it.
Why do they make that bed so tight?
You gotta sleep with your feet like that: It's for a mental patient.
Wait a minute, the phone.
We'll call the police.
She said she'd do anything.
Yeah, hello.
Police?
Yeah, listen we're in the back of a limo in Queens-- AstroTurf?
You know who's responsible for that, don't you?
The Jews!
Oh, the Jews hate grass.
They always have, always will.
We'll be ready in a minute.
Would you excuse us a minute, Tim Boy?
We're in the middle of something here.
With all due respect, Mr. O'Brien, we're just about to leave.
Tim?
Who's the head of the Aryan Union?
-You or me?
-You are.
And who is responsible for making hatemongering -and fascism popular again?
-You are.
Okay?
I think you forgot something.
-I'm sorry.
-Good.
Now get out.
-All right, what are we gonna do?
-I don't know.
How's this: we wait till we get to your street corner we see Elaine and Kramer, then we get out.
-They can't shoot us in the city.
-No.
No one's ever been shot in the city.
I'm telling you, something is going on.
I can feel it, sense it.
-I'm sure he was just joking around.
-Oh, no, this is no joke.
O'Brien's coming in from Chicago.
Jerry's in a limo, says he's O'Brien.
That's not funny.
Oh, my God.
Yes.
Yes!
What?
What is it?
Don't you see?
There's always been something very strange about Jerry.
Always so clean and organized.
-So?
-Do I have to spell it out for you?
The limo?
The name?
The rally at Madison Square Garden?
Jerry and O'Brien are the same person.
Jerry is the leader of the Aryan Union.
Jerry's a Nazi?
I can't even believe I didn't see it.
Listen, you idiot, just calm down.
I know Jerry.
He's not a Nazi.
-You don't think so?
-No.
He's just neat.
You know, it's funny.
You don't look like an O'Brien.
Me?
Yeah, right.
Get a load of this guy.
-And you don't look like a Murphy.
-I may not look like one -but I act like a Murphy.
-He's extremely Murphy.
To a fault.
Where are you from?
Dublin.
Originally.
Parents came over here when I was 18.
Cereal famine.
Couldn't get a bowl anywhere.
It was bad.
'Tis a beautiful country, though.
Lush rolling hills.
And the peat.
The peat.
Sounds more like Scottish.
We were right on the border.
Maybe he's with the company.
-What?
-The ClA.
Maybe they placed him in there to infiltrate the organization from within.
-What about his comedy act?
-That's the perfect cover.
All that time on the road.
Look, Jerry, he's too normal to be a comedian.
These comedians, they're sick, neurotic people.
-Well, what about George?
-What about him?
He's part of it.
His whole personality's a disguise.
There's no real person can act the way he does.
Elaine, I'm telling you, they're with the organization.
They're all part of it.
He's in there with Helms and Hunt and Liddy, that whole crowd.
George and Jerry, they probably know who killed Kennedy.
I bet they were even in on it.
All right, what are we gonna do?
What--?
I'm not gonna let them hurt you.
I'm not gonna-- Kramer, you're hurting me.
Those are our friends I told you about.
-Get off of me!
-We're gonna talk to them.
Pull over.
-Get off of me!
-It's all right.
-Get off!
-Hey, O'Brien!
-O'Brien!
-ls that him?
-Yeah, that's him!
-Look, there's O'Brien!
No-good Nazi bastard!
-Let's get him!
-Get him!
-What do we do?
-Get in the car!
-Get in the car!
-What?
What?
Come on, hey!
O'Brien.
Long time, no see.
How's tricks, Murphy?
Why did you call him O'Brien and him Murphy?
No, he was talking to me.
He's cross-eyed.
It could be very confusing.
Yeah?
-Eva?
-It's for me.
Hello?
It's O'Brien.
O'Brien?
Well, that's weird.
Who are you?
-I'm Jerry Seinfeld.
-I'm George Costanza.
This is a misunderstanding.
His car broke down.
I told him to get-- My car started shaking violently about a mile out.
-So he picks me up without a car.
-And there was a line-- The limo has just pulled up.
It's being surrounded by a huge crowd of protesters.
This has the makings of a very ugly scene.
I just didn't have anything to do tonight.
Then the phone rang and it was Jerry.
We just wanted a ride into the city.
He was supposed to pick me up, but he didn't pick me up.
And tonight we were gonna go to the basketball game-- They're banging on the car, trying to flip it over.
The police seem unable or unwilling to control the crowd.
I would imagine Mr. O'Brien must be having some very grave doubts if he made the right choice for his first appearance.
We did not want to antagonize the Nazis.
We have no intention of upsetting the Nazis.
-I don't have a problem with Nazis.
-Do whatever you want.
-Don't bother us, we won't bother you.
-I don't wanna make a Nazi unhappy.
-I swear.
I swear.
-I swear.
-I swear.
-I swear.
-Get out!
-Open the door.
Oh, look!
Look, it's Dan.
-Hi, Dan!
-Elaine?
-Hi!
Dan!
-Come on, let's go.
Go.
I am not O'Brien!
I am not O'Brien!
I repeat, I am not O'Brien!
Ask anyone.
Jerry!
Jerry!
So I was watching this movie the other night, a World War ll movie.
And there was Nazis in the movie.
And I noticed that the Nazis in those movies always had, like, two separate Heils.
They had the regular Heil that they would do and when they were around the offices, they had this casual Heil.
Remember that?
They'd come in the office: "Yeah, Heil, how are you?
What's?
Is the kid back with coffee?
Come on, are you finished with the copier?
Yeah, world domination, Aryan race.
So whose doughnuts are those?
Yeah, Heil.
Nice to see you.
Can I have one of those doughnuts"?

{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
The concept behind the car phone speakerphone, airline phone, portable phone pay phone, cordless phone, multiline phone the phone pager, the call waiting call forwarding, conferencing, speed dialling, direct dialling and redialling is that we all have absolutely nothing to say and we've got to talk to someone about it right now.
Cannot wait another second.
You're at home, you're on the phone.
You're in the car making calls.
You get to work, "Any messages for me"?
You gotta give people a chance to miss you a little!
It's bad enough you have a car phone.
You have to use the speaker?
It's safer.
Plus, it's more annoying to the other person.
-Oh, look at this guy.
-What's going on?
A guy's trying to get in front of me, has to ask permission.
Yes.
Go ahead.
Get in, get in.
-Did you get a thank-you wave?
-No, nothing.
How could you not give a thank-you wave?
Hey, buddy, where's my thank-you wave?
Give me that wave!
-Hey, Jerry, are you free on Friday?
-Yeah, I'm free.
Why?
Oh, God.
I bumped into Robin Sandusky today.
She asked me to have dinner with her and her husband.
Oh, my God.
You won't believe what I saw.
A car just bashed into a parked car and sped off, right on my block.
-You've got to follow that car.
-What?
-You can't let him get away with that.
-The guy could be dangerous.
-What are you, yellow?
-I'm not yellow.
Jerry, if you don't follow him, you're yellow.
-Wait.
He stopped.
He's parking.
-What?
What?
I can't hear you.
Jerry?
Excuse me.
I was driving behind you, you know a few blocks back, and l-- I couldn't help.
Maybe you didn't realize l-- I-- I witnessed that your-- Your left rear tire's a little low.
That can affect the performance of the twin l-beam suspension not to mention, you know, your rack-and-pinion steering.
So I wound up going out for a decaf cappuccino with her.
Boy, what a story.
I'm speechless, speechless.
I have no speech.
You know, I really liked her.
We talked, we flirted.
And when she laughed, she'd reach out and touch my arm.
Love when they touch your arm.
I can't get enough of that.
-Me either.
-Why is that?
Let's not even analyse it.
-So you didn't turn her in.
-I couldn't go though with it.
-You gonna see her again?
-Friday night.
-Yeah.
-It's me.
Come on up.
By the way, Elaine does not need to know about anything.
Hey, hey, hey.
I dig.
-Oh, you dig?
-Yes.
-I see enormous potential here.
-Why?
Because great couples always have a great story about how they met.
That's why I've never been in a long-term relationship.
I never had a good meeting story.
I wonder if I'm nuts for pursuing this woman at all.
I don't think so.
Look, she slammed into a parked car.
She took no responsibility for mutilating the property of a stranger and then she sped off like a criminal.
On the other hand should she never be allowed to date again?
Scratch one car and you're forbidden to have social contact for the rest of your life?
What am I drinking, milk?
-Hey.
-Hi.
-Sweater.
-Thank you.
So?
What happened?
-With what?
-With the car.
What car?
The hit-and-run.
Oh, right, right, right.
Well actually, the guy went into Queens.
Queens?
-You followed him over the bridge?
-Over the bridge.
Oh, l-- I didn't know you went into Queens, Jerry.
Yeah, Queens.
So?
Then what?
He gets out of the car.
I said, "Hey, buddy, I saw you hit that car".
So he says to me: "What are you gonna do about it"?
So I said to him, "Whatever's necessary".
I am speechless.
I am without speech.
Tell her about the shoving.
What?
What shoving?
-Oh, it was nothing.
-No.
Tell her.
Come on.
Tell me.
Well, he kind of lost his temper and he was pushing me up against the car so I went into a karate stance.
-You know karate?
-I know a little.
Well, l-- This is so amazing to me.
Jerry, what did he do?
He backed off.
He was pretty pathetic, actually.
Hey.
-Did you tell Kramer?
-No.
What, what?
Tell me.
Jerry saw this guy smash into a car, and he followed him.
Good for you.
What kind of a sick lowlife would do a thing like that?
You know, those people, you know they're mentally disturbed.
They should be sent to Australia.
-Australia?
-That's where England used to send their convicts.
-But not anymore.
-No.
Hey, Kramer?
Kramer.
-What happened to you right here?
-I don't know.
You know, I was watching Entertainment Tonight and suddenly, you know, I got dizzy and the next thing I know, I hit my head on the coffee table.
-Well, that is-- That is strange.
-Yeah, it's.
All right.
Oh, Jerry, we're still on for Friday night, right?
Oh, Friday.
No, I can't.
I'm sorry.
I have a date.
-But last night you said you were free.
-We just met.
You know, maybe it was a reaction to the sardines.
I-- I can't go alone.
Ask George to go with you.
George, come on.
I'll pay for you.
You'll pay?
I'm there.
-Why do you need anybody?
-Because I hate being at a table alone with a married couple talking about their married friends and their married furniture.
They're always trying to make me feel like their life is so much better.
You know, I have a very exciting life.
It's very exciting.
You went out with a bullfighter?
Yeah, yeah.
Well, an ex-bullfighter now.
-Wow.
-What was his name?
His name?
His name was-- Was Eduardo Caroccio.
Pass the salt, please.
Where did you meet him?
Actually, I met him in Switzerland and he was fighting.
Is that the word they use, "fighting"?
They don't really fight the bull.
They avoid fighting the bull.
Bread.
Oh, I just love meeting new people, you know?
That's how you really do learn about life.
-God bless you.
-Thank you.
I wasn't gonna say anything, but l saw he wasn't gonna open his mouth.
You know who's a good actor?
Anthony Quinn.
Oh, Anthony Quinn.
Fine actor.
But from what I understand, not a very good driver.
Hits everything on the road, but always leaves a note.
Did you ever see Zorba the Greek?
Excellent film.
In fact Quinn said he never felt so good as when he left a note after smacking into a car.
Come here.
Really, I was only kidding around.
He was only joking, Michael.
You think you're special because you say, "God bless you"?
I don't think I'm special.
My mother always said I'm not special.
He was only joking, Michael.
-I'm sorry.
-Oh, right.
-Take his side!
-I'm not taking his side.
-Well, whose side are you taking?
-Well, I'm not taking your side!
Kirk Douglas.
Now, there's another very bad driver.
But he's such an unbelievable guy when he hits someone, he doesn't leave a note.
He sits in his car and waits for the other person so he can exchange license, registration and apologize.
I said, "God bless you".
Was that so wrong?
The question is did you allow a space for the husband to come in with his "God bless you"?
Because as the husband, he has the right of first refusal.
-Yeah.
-It's me.
-Come on up.
-Yes.
Yes.
I definitely waited.
But let me say this.
Once he passes on that option that "God bless you" is up for grabs.
No argument, unless she's one of these multiple sneezers and he's holding his "God bless you" in abeyance until she completes the series.
I don't think she is a multiple sneezer because she sneezed again later and it was also a single.
What if she's having an off night?
-Hi.
-Hi.
Well.
If it isn't Mr. Gesundheit.
Oh, yeah.
Like there's something wrong with saying, "God bless you".
I was raised to say, "God bless you".
Shut up.
What does it mean anyway, "God bless you"?
It's a stupid "stuperstition".
A stupid what?
Whatever.
You wanna make a person feel better, you shouldn't say, "God bless you".
You should say, "You're so good-looking".
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's better than "God bless you".
Anyway, she left a message on my machine.
She wants you to call her.
-Who?
-Robin.
Why?
Well, I assume she called to apologize.
That's why she called me.
Entertainment Tonight is on.
-Where's the phone?
-Bedroom.
Hey, grab Jerry's sweater for me, would you?
Georgia peach Marla Maples reportedly threw yet another stiletto heel at-- What's it like out?
It's chilly out.
Should I take a sweater?
Yeah.
You could take a sweater if you want.
A scarf?
No.
Hey, shut this off.
Shut it off.
-What's the matter?
What's going on?
-What happened?
-What?
-I think I hit my head again.
-What is wrong?
-Hey, hey, wait a minute.
Let me ask you something, Kramer.
The last time you hit your head, was Mary Hart on TV?
-Yeah.
-That is it!
-What?
-That is it!
Mary Hart's voice!
Don't you see?
There's something about Mary Hart's voice that's giving you seizures.
Just like-- Just like-- Just like that woman in Albany!
Mary Hart!
-Oh, my God.
-What?
Well, she apologized, and she wanted to know if we could get together Wednesday afternoon.
-Get together?
-Maybe she just wants to talk to me.
Married women don't get together.
They have affairs.
Oh, my God, an affair.
It's so adult.
It's like with stockings and martinis and William Holden and.
On the other hand, it probably wouldn't cost me any money.
Are you actually considering this?
I can't have an affair with a married woman.
That's despicable!
It's like hitting a car and driving away without leaving a note.
Yeah.
Hey, you know who owns that car?
-What car?
-The one that was hit the other night.
-Yeah, who?
-That blond across the street.
The one with the long ponytail, she wears those blue sweatpants.
The blond with the blue sweatpants.
Yeah, I think I've seen her.
Well, I gotta get going.
I'm meeting a guy with grey sweatpants.
Wait, wait, wait.
How do you know it's not John Tesh?
-The blond with the blue sweatpants!
-Who is she?
I had a crush on her for a year!
I've been afraid to approach her.
She belongs on one of these Hallmark cards.
Oh, right!
Right!
The blue sweatpants!
It's too bad you can't say anything because of Angela.
Yeah.
Too bad.
Angela.
Lousy thug.
What kind of sick person does something like that?
The woman belongs in prison!
I mean, I actually owe it to society to do something about this!
I can't sit by and allow this to go on!
-It's a moral issue, is what it is.
-Can't compromise your principles.
-How can I live?
-Can't live.
I'm not religious, but I know where to draw the line.
This country needs more people like you.
Don't sell yourself short, saying, "God bless you" to every Tom, Dick and Harry, at great personal risk.
-I believe strongly in that.
You know.
-There should be more people like us.
That's why the world's in the shape that it's in.
You're telling me.
I just want you to know I'm gonna do everything I can to make sure the party responsible is made responsible or something very close to that.
Well, God bless you.
Thank you very much.
Oh, my God.
I must be crazy.
What have I done?
-Oh, no.
What's wrong?
-What's wrong?
I'll tell you what's wrong.
I just committed adultery.
You didn't commit adultery.
I did.
Oh, yeah.
If I didn't do it with you, I would have done it with someone else.
Well, I wouldn't want you to do that.
There's a lot of losers out there.
Maybe even someone who didn't say, "God bless you".
Well, that's a given.
In three years with Michael, not one "God bless you".
Must be hell living in that house.
-Hi, it's Michael.
-Hi, Michael.
-Is Robin there?
-Robin?
No, why?
She said she was gonna be with you.
No, I haven't spoken to her all da-- Yeah, right.
As a-- As a matter of fact.
She-- She was here and she-- She left a note but l-- I wasn't here, but l-- I have the note right here.
If she's not with you, where is she?
Well, l-- I don't know.
Is she with your bald friend from the other night?
No.
No.
Come on, Michael.
He's finished.
I'm gonna sew his ass to his face!
I'm gonna twist his neck so hard his lips will be his eyebrows!
I'm gonna break his joints and reattach them!
You're so good-looking.
Now, you listen to me, suck-face!
You tell anybody anything and I will carve my initials in your brain tissue.
-Let me rephrase-- -I'll bash your skull in Iike a bad cabbage, and I'll have a party on your head!
-Elaine.
This is Angela.
-I'll pluck your body hairs out with my teeth!
Well, I think I get the gist of it.
So you don't say anything to anybody about me hitting that car.
What car?
Good.
-I'm glad we understand each other.
-It's not complicated.
Very nice meeting you.
Come on up.
Well, well, Mr. Seinfeld that must have been so frightening when you confronted that guy in Queens.
Now, let me just see if I've got the scenario right.
-All right, Elaine.
-No, no, no because I'm picturing.
What?
What?
French Connection kind of thing.
You know, sort of a Popeye Doyle chase through the city.
-lt was just a couple of blocks.
-Oh, no, no.
Come on.
Don't be so modest.
-Hey.
-Oh.
Did you check your machine?
No.
Why?
What's happened?
Michael called me today, and he asked me where Robin was.
-Yeah, okay.
-And I said I hadn't seen her.
-What?
-No, George, you don't understand.
She didn't tell me she was using me as an excuse.
Okay?
But then I realized what was going on and I said that she left a note.
But he didn't really buy that.
And then-- And then he did mention your name.
He mentioned my name?
What did he say?
He said he was gonna sew your ass to your face.
What?
-Why couldn't you think of something?
-I don't know!
He caught me off guard!
You lie!
How hard is it to lie!
It's not that hard.
Well, who told you to sleep with her, George?
Not my fault.
I wasn't gonna do anything until you got her juiced up with your story about the affair with the matador!
None of this would have happened if you hadn't said, "God bless you"!
-Don't start.
-Hold it, hold it, hold it, people.
-Matador?
-Oh, God.
What matador?
She told them she had an affair with a matador.
A matador.
Well, well.
Pray tell, what was the young man's name?
Eduardo Caroccio.
Eduardo Caroccio.
That's good.
That's very good.
Kind of just rolls off the tongue.
Where on the Upper West Side might a single girl meet a matador?
-Perhaps, Zabar's.
-No.
Or Ray's Pizza.
This person told me to tell you to get an estimate on the damage.
I already got an estimate.
It's $875.
$875?
That's right.
Well, I'll tell you what.
I'll give you a check, and then this person can pay me back.
Who do I make it out to?
Becky Gelke.
G-E-L-K-E.
So, what are you doing this weekend?
You have got some nerve.
You smash up my car, you don't admit it and now you want to ask me out?
-I didn't do it!
-Yeah, right.
You are so good-looking.
Thank you.
Jerry, let's go.
You ready?
You really want to do this?
I'm on the road for three weeks.
Excuse me, I've got a maniac stalking me.
I'm not staying in the city.
-All right.
-Come on, let's get out of here.
How could you?
-What?
-I never thought you were capable.
-What did I do?
-I talked to Becky Gelke outside.
She told me you hit and ran.
I don't even want to look at you anymore!
All these years of friendship, and you're-- You're nothing but a felon!
You're an embarrassment to the building.
I didn't do it.
I just had to pay her to cover for somebody else.
-You're not gonna lie to me, are you?
-No.
Never.
All right.
I'm glad we got that straightened out because I got a date with her.
You got a date with Becky Gelke?
-I'm going out with her Saturday.
-Can we get out of here?
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have had an excuse to talk to her.
Well, I'm happy to help in any way that I can.
Liz Taylor.
A man is paralysed, mentally, by a beautiful woman.
Advertisers really take advantage of this.
Don't you love ads where you see the woman in the bikini next to the 32-piece ratchet set, you know, and she's?
We'll be looking at the girl Iooking at the ratchet set going, "All right, if she's next to the ratchet set and I had that ratchet set I wonder if that would mean that.
I better just buy that ratchet set".

Do you think that the security guards in art museums really ever stop anybody from taking the paintings?
I mean, are they going, "Hey, where do you think you're going with that?
Come over here.
Give me that Cézanne".
I mean, look at the job that this man is hired to do.
He's getting $5 an hour to protect millions of dollars of priceless art, with what?
He's got a light mocha brown uniform and a USA Today.
This is what he's got.
Crooks must look at this guy and go, "We get past the folding chair and the thermos of coffee, we can get a Rembrandt".
Kramer, would you hold still?
I can't do this if you keep moving.
You sure you don't want me to take my clothes off?
Because I'll do it.
No, that's the last thing in the world I want you to do.
Well, why don't you take your clothes off?
I don't know, I don't think Jerry would like that.
Well, it'll be our little secret.
God!
Button fly!
Why do they put buttons on a fly?
It takes 10 minutes to get these things open.
I like the button fly.
-What?
-That is one place on my wardrobe I do not need sharp, interlocking metal teeth.
It's like a mink trap down there.
I'm gonna develop kidney problems.
-What are you doing today?
-Nothing.
I have to go meet Nina.
Want to come up to her loft, check out her paintings?
-I don't get art.
-There's nothing to get.
It always has to be explained to me and then I have to have someone explain the explanation.
She does abstract stuff.
In fact, she's painting Kramer right now.
-What for?
-She sees something in him.
So do l, but I wouldn't hang it on a wall.
Are you getting the eyes?
Because they're brown.
Really, they're dark brown, like rich Colombian coffee.
Tell me about Elaine.
You know, she and Jerry were a big thing Iike Abe Lincoln and Mary Todd.
-But they're still friends.
-Yeah, yeah.
They're like this: -Don't you think that's strange?
-Why?
What's the difference?
Are you still friends with any of your ex-girlfriends?
Well, you know, l. I have many relationships.
-I tell you, I'm a little nervous.
-Why?
You know, the friend meeting the new woman.
I feel like I'm getting fixed up for a friendship.
I don't know how long this is gonna last.
Really?
I thought you liked her.
I do, but she's got, like, a jealousy thing.
She doesn't like me having fun with anyone but her.
You know, it's a miracle you're not married.
Hey, I'm not obligated to buy anything, am l?
-Hi, Nina.
-Hi.
-This is my friend George.
-Hello.
Nice to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you.
Hey, look at this guy!
I brought George up to see some of your paintings.
Oh, are you interested?
Yeah, sure.
Sure, I'm interested.
George, you gonna buy a painting?
Yeah, sure.
-Are you an art lover?
-I am an art adorer.
I adore art.
Great.
Take a look around.
Pick something out you like.
May l?
Get out of here.
Here.
Play with this.
-What's this?
-My father gave me four tickets to the Yankee game for Saturday afternoon.
Owner's box, first row, behind the dugout.
Saturday!
I'm working.
I'm going out of town.
Well, I won't go without you.
You guys want them?
Yeah.
They're right behind the dugout, George.
First row.
Behind the dugout?
Are you kid--?
How did you get them?
My father's the Yankees' accountant.
It's the owner's box.
All my life I've dreamed of sitting front row, behind the dugout.
You like that one?
Look at where we are!
He's not stopping.
He keeps going and going and going.
We're not in the first row?
-No, no.
These are your seats.
-She said first row behind the dugout.
It's the second row.
It's just as good.
I was primed for the first row.
I was gonna put my feet on the dugout.
Shut up.
These are great.
You can't get any better than this.
There's better.
Right there.
That's better.
All right.
Oh, boy.
-All right.
Who wants a dog?
-Yeah.
Here you go.
What a great day.
I could've been at my boss' son's bris right now.
That what you were supposed to do?
Yeah.
What makes him think anyone wants to witness a circumcision?
I'd rather go to a hanging.
Is it that unattractive to have to take it off?
Have you ever seen one with it?
No.
You wouldn't even know what it was.
Anyway, I called him back.
I told him I had to visit my father in the hospital in Maryland.
You better catch it here, Charlie, because this ain't Philadelphia!
-George?
-Yeah?
Hi.
I'm Leonard West.
-Nina's father.
-Hi, hi, Mr. West.
I'm sorry.
-This is my friend Elaine.
-Hi.
Hey,.
230 ain't gonna cut it in this town, babe!
This is Kramer.
Hey, how you doing?
Yes!
Yes!
-How are the seats?
-Okay.
-Great.
They're great.
-I hear you bought -one of Nina's paintings.
-It's being framed now.
I don't even know what it costs.
Not too expensive, is it?
Not if you have a lot of money.
It was cheaper for me when she was an actress.
Well.
-Enjoy the game.
-Thanks.
I think you better take off the Orioles cap.
Yeah.
I better.
No, no.
Seriously.
You're in the owner's box.
I don't think it's a good idea.
-You're not serious.
-Yes, yes, yes, I am.
-Did he say that?
-No, but he gave me the seats.
I don't think he'd like you wearing an Orioles cap.
-Maybe you should ask him.
-I don't have to.
Are you gonna take the hat off or not?
No.
I'm not gonna take it off.
Why should l?
That's ridiculous.
Just take the cap off.
George, I am at a baseball game.
-This is America.
-Look!
Either you take the cap off or you leave.
I'm not taking it off.
-Elaine, just take the cap off.
-No!
Get off of my hat!
-What's--?
-What do you mean?
!
-Stop it!
-Just take it off!
-There's your cap!
-Let's go.
Oh, my God.
All right, get your hands off of me!
-I'm leaving.
-Wait a minute.
We just got here.
Do you want us to go with you?
-No, you stay.
-Get your cap, George.
-Well, I was just thinking-- -Yeah.
Stay!
All right, all right, we'll go, we'll go.
And then the ball hits him in the head, and he falls right over the railing.
-ls he okay?
-Well, yeah, he's fine.
We took him to the emergency room.
The x-rays were all negative.
It was quite a day.
This is the most amazing story I've ever heard.
Why did he want you to take off the baseball cap?
-That is so insane.
-I know.
Can you imagine that?
-How you feeling?
-Oh, yeah.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Hi, Carol.
Hey, look.
We made the paper.
Look at this.
Page two, sports section.
We're all in the picture.
-Picture?
-Picture.
-Our picture's in there?
What?
-Yeah.
I cannot believe this.
-There's George.
-Look at him.
Oh, my God!
Lippman could see this!
He thinks I was visiting my father.
Oh, my God!
I make up one little white lie, and they put my picture in the paper!
Hi, Mr. Lippman.
How's your father?
My-- My father.
Yeah.
You went to see him, right?
Yeah.
-I went to visit him.
-So -what was wrong with him?
-Well, you name it.
You know.
Neuritis, neuralgia.
But he's feeling better now, right?
Yes.
Yeah.
It's such a miracle.
You know, my visit must have buoyed his spirits.
Buoyed.
-What did I say?
-You said "boy'd".
-I did?
-Yeah.
Well, I got a plane to catch.
-Where are you going?
-Going to Houston for a few days.
Publishers' convention.
Can I have my sports section?
-Oh, yeah.
-Sports section.
I'm saving it for the plane.
I never miss the Sunday sports section.
There's nothing to read.
It's yesterday's news.
The Yankees won, the Mets lost, Rickey Henderson's unhappy.
Right.
Right.
What are you doing?
That is the third time today I have done that.
I keep, you know, grabbing newspapers and just tugging at them.
Well, I gotta go.
Okay.
Yes, well, you know, have a nice trip.
Alrighty.
I'll just hold down the fort.
I sense great vulnerability a man-child crying out for love an innocent orphan in the postmodern world.
I see a parasite.
A sexually depraved miscreant who is seeking only to gratify his basest and most immediate urges.
She was a guest of my father's.
-She should've taken the cap off.
-It's preposterous to ask someone to take off a baseball cap at a baseball game.
How can you defend that?
His struggle is man's struggle.
He lifts my spirit.
He is a loathsome, offensive brute.
Yet I can't look away.
Look, I'm tired of all this fighting.
Maybe we should end this before we really start hating each other.
You wouldn't want that, because you always have to remain friends.
I like to remain friends with people I was friends with.
Hey, why don't you just go then?
And give this to George.
Tell him he owes me $500.
He transcends time and space.
He sickens me.
I love it.
Me too.
Five hundred dollars?
-What?
-That's what she told me.
I'm not paying $500 for this!
It's a piece of junk!
-That's what it costs.
-Why did you take it?
-You broke up with her.
-I wasn't thinking.
I don't know.
You weren't thinking.
I mean, she framed it and everything.
I'm not buying this.
No way.
Forget it.
No way I'm buying this.
I mean, look at it!
What is it?
It's a bunch of squiggly lines.
Are you telling me you couldn't paint this?
You want me to paint you something?
I'd love to paint you something.
I'm not paying for this.
If you were going out with her, it'd be a different story.
This was in front of your door.
-Hey, Kramer.
-Hi, Mike.
Wow, a letter from Nina!
Man, that is the ugliest thing I've ever seen.
-Oh, my God.
-What?
This is amazing.
You can't believe this.
Listen to this.
"l don't know what you expect to find, Jerry.
You know what you want better than me, but there's one thing I do know.
I can stand here watching you try to destroy everything I've ever wanted in my life wanting to smash your face with my fists because you won't even make the slightest effort to opt for happiness and still know I love you.
You mean so much to me, I'm willing to take your abuse insults and insensitivity".
-Wow.
-She's deep.
"Because that's what you need to do to prove I'm not gonna leave you.
I'm sick and tired of running from places and people and relationships.
You want me, then fight for me, beca-- Because I'm sure as hell fighting for you.
I think we're both worth it".
You know, Jerry, she sounds like a poet.
Boy, no one's ever written me a letter like this.
Maybe I was wrong about her.
Get in there and give her a call.
Pick up the phone and call her.
-Should l?
-Yes, you're damn right you should!
Fight for her, Jerry!
She's sure the hell fighting for you!
All right!
I'll call her.
Don't go in there.
You're gonna get shot.
I told you.
-Yeah.
-It's George.
Come on up.
Well, now we gotta get a posse together.
I love a good posse.
What's the appeal of the posse?
The appeal of the posse?
Posse has tremendous appeal.
Get away from the job, you camp out, you're with friends.
Come on, it's a week-long game of hide and go seek on horseback.
Hello, George.
Hey.
Hey, Nina.
I owe you some money, don't l?
-Well, I really love that piece.
-Me too.
Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.
You know, in fact, I've been thinking about it, and you know, I feel like I'm stealing from you.
Five hundred dollars!
This is gonna be worth thousands soon.
You know what?
On second thought, I can't even accept this.
No, no, no.
George, a deal's a deal.
I want you to have it.
This could be in a museum someday.
It's not safe with me.
It should really be in a doorman building.
Honestly, George, the money's not important.
Who said anything about money?
-Yeah.
-It's Elaine.
Come on up.
-Elaine?
-Yeah.
She does not believe in telephones, does she?
She likes the pop-in.
I've told her how I hate the pop-in.
He likes the pop-in too.
Just popped in now.
I'm a big pop-in guy.
-He is.
-What about Kramer?
Huge pop-in guy.
Well, I was leaving anyway.
So we're on for tomorrow?
-Yeah.
-Okay.
Bye.
Hello.
Chatty gal.
Lippman's coming back tomorrow.
I'll be fired.
If he noticed it, he would have called you.
No.
He wants to torture me.
Will you give me the clicker?
I hate it when you have the clicker.
You're too fast.
Get out!
I'm a great clicker.
I have great instincts.
How dare you impugn my clicking.
You're all over the dial.
You don't know what you want.
You never stay on anything longer than five seconds.
Just give me that.
-Let go.
-Come on.
I want it, Jerry!
-Let go, Elaine!
-Then let George do it!
-George can't click!
-Give it to me!
Give it!
Give it!
Give it!
Pinheads.
Maybe I can't analyse and theorize and speculate on why we-- Wait a second.
Go back to that.
Go back to that.
Hey, you read all those books, not me.
It's Chapter Two.
It's Neil Simon.
But one thing I do know.
I know how I feel.
Wait a second.
Wait a second!
-What?
-My God.
The letter.
That's the letter!
-What letter?
-This is the letter she wrote to me.
She stole it from the movie!
Because you don't even make.
"The slightest effort to opt for happiness and still know that I love you"!
This is incredible.
I always thought there was something funny about this letter.
She's copied it right out of Chapter Two.
She's a thief!
A bunco artist.
Maybe I won't send her that check.
You know, it's not really that terrible.
What are you talking about?
She completely misrepresented herself.
I don't opt for happiness.
I opt for happiness.
James Caan doesn't opt for happiness.
Yeah.
Yeah.
She wouldn't take the cap off?
No.
But didn't she know they were the owner's seats?
Oh, that's unbelievable.
Yeah, okay.
All right, Lenny.
Thanks again.
Take care.
That's Lenny West, my accountant, who's a hell of a guy.
He handles the Yankees too.
It's his biggest account.
So every once in a while, they throw him a couple of seats and last weekend, he gave them to his daughter.
She's an artist, by the way.
Anyway her daughter gives them to some friends, you know?
One of her friends shows up wearing a Baltimore cap.
You're from Baltimore, right?
It's Towson.
That's near Baltimore.
But you're an Oriole fan, right?
Well, fan.
You know, my father-- Anyway, she refused to take the cap off.
She caused a whole big scene.
Really?
That's so impudent.
Yeah.
So Lenny gave me the tickets for tomorrow night.
I'm inviting Frank and Marsha.
Want you to come.
I've got plans, though, Mr. Lippman.
Well, break them.
You missed the bris.
I want you at the game.
Okay.
Okay.
-Good.
-Okay, Mr. Lippman.
And, Elaine, you know the Baltimore cap you got in your office wear it.
I'm gonna have a little fun with him.
That will be fun.
How's it coming?
Good.
Good.
Seen any good movies lately?
No.
Not really.
-You?
-No.
I like a good comedy.
You know, like a Neil Simon.
-You like Neil Simon?
-Neil Simon?
Some of his stuff.
I've seen most of it.
I guess my favourite would have to be Chapter Two.
Have you ever seen that?
I don't know.
Maybe.
I have.
Funny.
Funny.
In fact, it was on TV just the other night.
Happened to catch it.
I couldn't help but notice a stunning similarity.
Well, we've made our decision.
We want the Kramer.
Five thousand?
Why would anybody buy Kramer for $5000?
Boy, the Yankees cannot buy a hit tonight.
So is it all over between you and Marsha Mason?
Yeah.
And by the way, can you get this thing out of my house?
I'll make a deal with you.
-I'll sell it to you for 10 bucks.
-Please.
Seems to be a lot of trouble in the area just behind the Yankee dugout.
Behind the dugout?
That's where we were sitting the other night.
We're not gonna show it, don't want to encourage that kind of behaviour.
It's a young lady, and she's really going at it with the security guard.
She's a feisty one.
They're getting the other security guard to come down.
How do you like that, Seaver?
And, boy, she's something, and a Baltimore fan at that.
Holy cow!
When I was 1 7, I ran away from home and hopped a steamship to Sweden.
-This steak is excellent, by the way.
-More potatoes?
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Please.
Yes, yes, go on.
You hopped a steamship to Sweden?
It was a big one.
Baseball season's starting.
I'm very excited about that.
Did you ever sneak down to better seats at the game and get caught by the usher?
When you're a kid, you're getting chased from every place anyway.
When you're an adult, it's really embarrassing.
You have to pretend like there's some confusion.
You put on this whole act.
You're looking at the tickets.
"l don't understand how this could have happened.
Let me see.
I see the problem.
These are very good seats.
I have very bad seats.
That's the misunderstanding".

{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
In parking lots, they have this "compact car only" spot.
Isn't that discrimination against the size of your car?
If I want my ass hanging out of the back of my parking spot that's my business.
There are people with real asses hanging out of their pants.
Nobody's stopping them.
Nobody goes, "Hey, hold it, sir.
Those are compact jeans.
You can't pull that in there".
Hey.
I got bad news for you, buddy.
I think your car got stolen again.
What are you talking about?
You parked on 84th and Columbus, right?
I just walked by there, and that car is gone.
Yeah, I know.
Well, where is it?
What's the difference?
Well, there's no difference.
You know, I'm just curious.
Always have to know everything that's going on, don't you?
-What happened to the car?
-lf I don't tell you, it'll kill you, won't it?
-Yeah, yeah.
It'll kill me.
-You have to know.
-You must know.
-I must know.
Well, I'm not telling you.
Come on.
Nope.
I don't think so.
-Well, please?
-Not today, pal.
Okay, I beg you.
Now, see, just saying "beg" doesn't make it a real beg.
You gotta put some beg into it.
Okay.
Please!
Please tell me!
All right, but your begging needs a lot of work.
-Okay, okay.
What is it?
-I loaned the car to George.
George.
All right.
Well, what for?
George and Elaine went to a flea market in Westchester.
Okay?
All right.
Why'd they go there?
Would you stop it, already?
-Why didn't they ask me to go?
-I don't know!
How am I supposed to know?
-What, they don't like me?
-I don't like you.
Well, if they liked me, why didn't they ask me to go?
Yeah.
I really think it looks good.
Ten bucks.
How can you go wrong?
All bald people look good in hats.
You should have lived in the '20s and '30s.
Men wore hats all the time then.
What a bald paradise that must have been.
Nobody knew.
You can wear a hat all the time now.
-Who's stopping you?
-No, I can't.
What if I meet a woman?
I'd always worry about that first moment where I take it off and see that look of disappointment on her face.
You sure you like these sunglasses?
Man.
Well, I'm very disappointed in George and Elaine.
And you know I'm somebody you don't wanna have on your bad side.
-Why not?
-Because I'm like ice, buddy.
When I don't like you, you got problems.
-ls this for the fight?
-Yeah.
Starts in 35 minutes.
Yeah.
Hey, I invited Mike Moffett.
You don't mind, do you?
No.
I like Mike.
I just got off the phone with him.
We had a great conversation.
-Yeah?
What did you talk about?
-Actually, we talked about you.
Yeah.
He had some pretty interesting things to say.
Yeah?
What did he say?
You have to know everything, don't you?
-Come on.
What'd he say?
-Why is that?
Why do you have to know everything?
-Kramer, just tell me what he said.
-Beg me.
-Please don't make me beg.
-No, I want you to beg me.
And I don't want you to say it.
I want you to put some beg in it.
Go on.
Kramer, please tell me what the guy said.
No, no.
That's no good.
No, I really don't think that's a beg.
No way.
It's close, but.
-Kramer!
-Look, I can't say anything.
The guy told me this stuff in confidence.
I'd be betraying a friend.
Well, you can't just mention it and then not tell me.
All right.
I'll tell you, but you can't say anything to him.
I'm not saying anything.
I'm putting it in the vault.
I'm locking the vault.
It's a vault!
-He thinks you're a phoney.
-He what?
I told you.
He thinks you're a phoney.
-A phoney?
He called me a phoney?
-A big phoney.
Big one.
Why did you tell me that if I can't say anything?
You begged me.
Do you hear that?
Of course I hear that.
You had to move the mirror.
I wanted to check out my sunglasses.
Went to look in the mirror, it was gone.
You threw off my equilibrium.
Yeah.
Blame it on me because you can't drive, George.
-I can't drive?
-Yeah.
Nobody drives like me.
Nobody.
I'm doing things in this car, you have no idea they're going on.
Want to see a right turn from the left lane?
No, I really don't.
-I can make a left from the right lane.
-I'm sure you could.
-What are we gonna tell Jerry?
-I don't know.
Start looking for spaces.
You're never gonna find a space on Jerry's block.
Just put it in a garage.
Look, I have my system.
First, I look for the dream spot in front of the door, then I slowly expand out in concentric circles.
No.
Come on, George.
Please put it in a garage.
I don't wanna spend an hour looking for a space.
I can't park in a garage.
-Why?
-I don't know.
I just can't.
Nobody in my family can pay for parking.
It's a sickness.
My father never paid for parking.
My mother.
My brother.
Nobody.
-I'll pay for it.
-You don't understand.
A garage.
I can't even pull in there.
It's like going to a prostitute.
Why should I pay when, if I apply myself, maybe I could get it for free?
What?
What do you want?
Go around me.
I'm looking for spaces.
George!
There's a space right there!
-Beautiful.
-You just passed it, see?
Look at that, the dream space.
Right in front of Jerry's building.
Dreams can come true.
What did I tell you?
You didn't even have to take it out to dinner.
All right, now you're gonna see some parallel parking.
I wish you could make a living parallel parking.
It's all geometry, knowing all the angles when to make that first turn and when to swing it back in.
That's the key.
Will you just park it, already?
There's nothing I can impart to you.
That's the sad thing.
It's so inborn.
I can't pass it on.
Look at this guy.
What, are you crazy?
What are you doing?
Hey, hey!
You're stealing my space!
Wait, you don't know who this guy is!
People kill for a parking space in this city.
-He's not getting away with this.
-George!
What are you doing?
I think I'm parking my car.
You can't do that.
You can't sneak in from the back like that.
I'm not sneaking!
I didn't even know you were parking.
You were just sitting there.
If you didn't think I was parking, why did you put it in headfirst?
That's the way I park!
You didn't start backing in until I pulled in.
I was in the middle of a conversation.
Hey, buddy, what can I tell you?
The point is, I was here first.
I was closer to this space than you were!
But I'm backing in, you can't put it in headfirst!
I can if I have room!
Are you gonna move the car?
No, I'm not gonna move the car.
-Jerk.
-You're not?
-You believe this guy?
-We'll put it in the garage.
I am not putting it in the garage.
It's my space.
What are you gonna do, you're gonna leave it here like this?
-I'm going upstairs.
-Are you coming back down?
I gotta tell Jerry we're here.
I gotta go to the bathroom.
Make sure he reserves the good chair for me.
What are we gonna tell him about the clanking noise?
Me?
No, no, no.
You.
You're gonna tell him.
-I'm not gonna-- No!
-You're good at this.
-What am I gonna say?
-I don't know.
You'll think of something.
Just break it to him gently.
Man!
Oh, my God.
I need a drink.
Got any Hennigan's here?
Yeah.
Under the counter.
What happened?
God.
Jerry, it was so terrible, what we just went through on the way home.
You wouldn't believe it.
What?
Tell me what happened.
Okay.
Now listen.
We were at the tollbooth at the Henry Hudson Parkway, okay?
And there were these, like, this pack of extremely wild teenagers in a convertible behind us, okay?
And for some reason, I don't know, they just started to taunt us.
And so-- So then we paid the toll, and then we went through and then they started to follow us!
So George tries to lose them, and-- And-- But-- But they were in this really-- Like a souped-up car, you know?
And so he turned off the road really suddenly and the car was on two wheels, and I was just screaming and then-- George is such a great driver.
-He is?
-He is fantastic.
And then they fired a gun right up in the air!
-A gun?
-I think it was a gun.
And then they followed us all the way into the city.
And then they stopped, and they turned around and they went home.
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?
-Yeah, yeah.
I'm all right.
God.
-Oh, man.
By the way, the car hit a pothole, and now it's making a clanking noise.
Well, I mean, as long as you're okay, that.
That's the important thing.
Exactly.
Where's George now?
He's out in front arguing with some guy about a parking space.
-What are you talking about?
-Look out the window, you'll see.
Hey, Georgie!
Hey!
Are you okay?
Yeah.
I'm fine.
Crazy kids, huh?
What?
It's my cuticle.
Is that Jerry?
-Jerry!
-Hey, Mike.
What, you know Jerry?
-Yeah, I know Jerry.
-How do you know him?
-What's the difference?
-Because I know him too -and probably a lot better than you.
-Well, bully for you.
Hey, Jerry.
You know, your friend here is a real piece of work!
-I'm coming down.
-Hey, will you tell Kramer I'm outside?
What, you know Kramer?
-Hi.
-Hello.
Hey, your friend Mike's outside.
He wants to talk to you.
Hey, Mike!
Come on up!
The fight's almost starting.
-You're watching the fight at Jerry's?
-Yeah.
Oh, great.
-You know that guy downstairs?
-Yeah.
He's a real phoney.
What's going on?
Will you come on down?
This guy's in my space!
It's my space!
I'll be down in a minute.
-Are you going down?
-Yeah.
-ls anything wrong?
-Why should anything be wrong?
I'll be down in a minute.
Hey, pal.
You're not getting that space.
I mean, I'll sleep in my car if I have to.
I'll die out here.
He was down there.
Once he passed his front bumper, it's no longer his space.
-No.
It doesn't matter.
He was here-- -Hey, Jerry.
-Long time no see.
-Hi, Mike.
-lndiana.
-Hey, Krame.
-You know this guy?
-Yeah.
Yeah, I know him.
You're looking tremendous.
What, are you on some regimen?
Yeah, 25-percent bran flakes.
The 40 percent was too much, so l found a store to make it special.
They take it down another 15 percent.
That's killer!
Killer!
I love that.
You've got to use that.
That's a definite.
Come on.
Hey!
-Your friend here has real problems.
-Me?
See what he did?
See how he tried to sneak into my space?
Going in front-first isn't sneaking!
You went in front-first because you saw me backing up!
I went front-first because I can make it front-first.
Pull out!
I'll show you!
You got a prayer.
I go in front-first all the time.
Front-first.
That's how you park when you're pulling a bank job.
-Did you talk to him?
-Yeah.
-It's all taken care of.
-You told him?
What did you tell him?
I did a number on him.
It was a thing of beauty.
You really had to be there to appreciate it.
I can't believe it.
What'd you say?
I told him a pack of teenagers in a convertible were terrorizing us and they followed us into the city.
A pack of teenagers?
Yeah.
By the time I got to the end of the story he was so relieved we were alive, he couldn't care less about the car.
You are a genius.
It's as simple as that.
What can I say?
You know, it's a gift.
I only wish I could teach you, but, you know, it's inborn.
By the way, thanks for inviting me to the flea market.
-What?
-Yeah.
Jerry, he told me all about it.
-Great.
-I didn't know.
Oh, so that's why you were acting so funny.
Well, I didn't know you wanted to go.
A flea market?
You went to a flea market?
-Who's talking to you?
-We just didn't think of you.
-You said it, sister.
-Every time I leave my house now I have to call everybody and ask if they wanna do what I'm doing?
People forget.
Look at Home Alone.
They forgot.
Great move telling him, by the way.
Real smart move.
I didn't know I wasn't supposed to say anything.
Judgment, Jerry, judgment.
You exercise no judgment!
You're right.
My fault.
I'm sorry, Kramer.
I'm so sorry.
Really.
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I don't care for that "sorry".
What's wrong with that sorry?
That was a good sorry.
Jerry -was that a good sorry?
-lt was a so-so sorry.
Hey!
Move this car!
I gotta get through!
You heard the man.
I guess you better be moving your car.
Like you're not just gonna back it in if I do that.
Well, somebody better move something soon!
I got a truck full of ice cream here!
They had to move the cars so the truck could get through, right?
These guys don't trust each other, so they got two nonpartisan drivers to move them.
Wild pack of teenagers, huh?
Yeah.
Amazing how they pick you out of everyone to terrorize.
Yeah.
I know.
I said to myself, "Why us"?
You remember?
Sounds like you did some pretty nifty manoeuvring.
You know, it's interesting, under that pressure, what you're capable of.
-Right.
-I learned a lot about myself.
-What did you do to my car?
-I couldn't help it!
Elaine moved the mirror!
I got discombobulated!
Like you've ever been "bobulated".
I thought you said you were a good driver.
No, I never said I was a good driver, I said, I was a good parker.
I think you said driver.
Parker.
I never said driver.
I said, parker.
Great parker.
That's not the way it was.
Move it up.
-No, that's the right position.
-No, no.
I was further in.
No, you weren't.
Stop there.
-Do you mind?
-Do you?
Somebody better move these cars.
-You're making a commotion.
-Hey, Sid.
-Who are you?
-Never mind who I am.
I know who I am.
Do you know who you are?
Why is it every time you park a car in this block everything gets disrupted and disjointed?
-Sid, it's completely his fault.
-Right.
Why don't you start taking the bus.
Let's go.
I'm putting it in the garage.
The fight's starting in two minutes.
-Enough!
-No!
Don't do it!
Are we gonna stay here all night?
Yes.
I'm not giving him the satisfaction.
It's my space.
Why don't you just flip a coin, already.
No, this is a matter of principle.
That would be saying anybody can pull into any space any way they want.
I'm making a stand here.
I'm saying no to headfirst parking!
We put up with too much crap in this city!
We're not putting up with headfirst parking!
Maybe if you hadn't been pontificating about what a great parker you were you might have got the space.
So you're against me now?
He could have pulled up to that car and backed in but he chose to go in headfirst.
No, he couldn't, because the other car was already backing in.
-No, he wasn't.
-All that matters is who was there first.
You're not even old enough to drive, you little puke.
You just spit on me!
Don't you raise your voice to me.
You're not my father!
Hey, Matthew.
Hi, Jerry.
This guy's really a jerk.
-How you doing?
-Okay.
I hear your father's closing his store.
What?
-No.
Nothing.
-What's happened to Daddy?
-He's going out of business?
-No, no, no.
We're not going to have any money?
-We're out of money?
-No, of course not.
Mommy!
Jerry says Daddy's closing the store.
He's going out of business.
We don't have any money?
Jerry, what's the matter with you?
I didn't.
I don't know about your friend Jerry.
He says some stupid things sometimes.
Yeah.
-Congratulations.
-What for?
Well, you're pregnant.
-What?
-You're not pregnant?
No, I'm not pregnant.
-Are you sure you're not pregnant?
-Yes, I'm sure!
-That's weird.
-Come on, Matthew.
-No!
-Come on, Matthew!
I thought she was pregnant.
Hey, do you think I'm a phoney?
-What?
-Mike thinks I'm a phoney.
-He thinks you're a phoney?
-But I can't say anything -because I'm not supposed to know.
-You have to say something.
I can't.
I told Kramer I was vaulting it.
-You gotta open the vault.
-Open my vault?
!
-Open your vault.
-Once I open the vault -it ceases to be a vault.
-You have no choice.
The vault.
You know why you can't go in front-first?
I'll tell you why.
Because it signals a breakdown in the social order.
Chaos!
It reduces us to jungle law.
When can you park headfirst?
Never.
-Why are you asking him?
-Who's talking to you?
He's right!
Never!
What if you got 10 car lengths?
Should you pull all the way to the front car?
If you got 10 car lengths.
When do you ever have What about Sundays and holidays?
Please.
What's going on here?
This guy tried to sneak into my space.
I really hate people who do that.
I hope you don't let him get away with it.
Thank you for your support.
Hey, that's a great hat.
Really?
You like it?
I got it at a flea market today.
-Hey, George, nice hat.
-Yeah, thanks.
-Can I try it on?
-No!
It wouldn't fit you.
-Sure, it would.
-No!
Get out of here, Newman.
-Let me try it.
-No!
Stop it!
-Let him try it on.
-I don't want him to!
What is wrong with you?
You want to see?
There!
There it is!
Run!
All right!
You wanna try on the hat?
!
Try on the hat!
Stop it, George!
Stop it.
I was defending your parking.
-Come on, George!
-Okay, just keep the hat!
That's it.
The fight's already started.
I'm going upstairs.
-Who's coming?
Elaine?
-Depends on who's going.
You going?
-I'm not going if he's going!
-Me either!
-Well, I'm going.
-lf he's going, I'm not going!
-It's your house!
-I don't have to go.
-I won't go if Jerry's not.
-Why won't you go if I go?
Why?
I'll tell you why.
-No.
Don't, Jerry.
-Like you didn't call me a phoney!
What?
-Thanks!
Real good!
-All right.
Jerry.
I think you completely misunderstood what I said.
I meant it in a complimentary way.
You know, when people say, "He's bad," it really means, "He's good".
That sort of thing?
-You know, slang.
-Use it in a sentence.
Man, that Michael Jordan is so phoney.
Why did you tell him?
!
-He begged me!
-He begged you?
!
Come on, who wants to watch the fight?
Okay, whose cars are these?
Let's move them.
Let's go.
Officer, can I explain something to you?
Let's go, or I'm gonna write both of you a ticket in about two minutes.
He can't pull in headfirst!
Officer, he backed up from down the street!
He was double-parked!
He was sitting there!
All right, you move your car.
It's his space.
You can't go in headfirst.
Wait a second.
Why can't he go in headfirst?
He said the guy was just sitting over there.
What are you talking about?
This guy was here first.
-But he didn't take it.
-Hey!
It's his space!
No, it's his space!
You're gonna have to go to the bathroom!
-You'll have to go to work!
-I don't have a job!
Neither do l!

People will kill each other for a parking space in New York.
Because they think, "lf I don't get this one, I may never get a space".
You know.
"I'll circle for months until somebody goes out to the Hamptons".
Everybody in New York City knows there's gotta be way more cars than parking spaces.
You see cars driving in New York all hours of the night.
It's like musical chairs, except everybody sat down around 1964.
The problem is, car manufacturers are building hundreds of thousands of new cars every year.
They're not making any new spaces.
That's what they should work on.
Wouldn't that be great?
You go to the auto show, they got that big revolving turntable and there's nothing on it.
"New from Chrysler: a space".

{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
I bought the Ginsu knife.
I did buy the Ginsu knife.
I know, you can't believe it, but I did, I swear.
I saw it.
It was late, I'm watching and it started making sense to me.
I'm thinking: "Yeah, cut through the shoe, cut through the can, yeah.
Yeah, I want that".
So I called up the number on the screen, you know and I said, "I'd like to order the Ginsu knife".
And the lady went, "Really"?
I mean, even the Ginsu people have given up.
It's really so sad, you know.
I guess, to be honest, if you need a knife that can cut through a shoe perhaps you're not buying the highest grade of meat available.
Maybe you ought to think about not getting the "hoof cut" once in a while.
What is it about sleep that makes you so thirsty?
Do dreams require liquid?
It's not like I'm running a marathon, I'm just lying there.
What the hell?
Why is the door open?
-Kramer, what are you doing here?
!
-Jerry, now calm down.
It's okay.
-Oh, God.
-I'm sorry.
I didn't want to wake you up.
I was watching Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo and l-- You know, I wanted to get some popcorn so I used the spare keys that you gave me to come in to get your popper.
-You scared me!
-It's just me.
-That's enough!
-Yeah, okay.
Forgot the popper.
It's not broken.
Come on.
Kramer!
What are you doing?
What does it look like?
What?
Get out of the bathroom.
I gotta go!
All right, all right.
-Come on!
-All right.
-Move it, move it!
Get going!
-Well, my drain's all clogged up.
-ls that my towel?
-Yes.
I'm really happy the movie was sold out.
You ever pretend there's murderers chasing you and see how fast you can get into your apartment?
I'm from Wichita.
-There he is!
-Hurry, Jerry, he's coming.
-He's coming.
The murderers!
-Hurry.
Hurry, he's coming.
Hurry!
Oh, Jerry.
Boy, that was close.
Did you see the look on that guy's face?
-You were so fast with those keys.
-Well.
-Beautiful.
-Kramer!
What the hell are you doing here?
Hey, Jerry, how are you?
I thought you were going to the movies.
That's it, hand them over.
-What?
-You know what.
The keys.
You've lost your key privileges.
-Oh, come on.
-No "come on".
-I thought you went to the movie.
-lt was sold out.
How was I to know it would be sold out?
-That's the point.
-What point?
-Just give me the keys.
-Just give me another chance.
-Don't ask me.
-I'm asking you.
-I'm telling you.
-You're joking.
-I'm serious.
-lt won't happen again.
-lt will.
Give me the keys.
-No.
-Let go.
-You let go.
Come on, Jerry.
Now, stop it.
Come on, Kramer.
Oh, great!
Okay, all right.
Fine, you go ahead.
Take the keys.
But you're gonna regret this.
All right, yeah.
Goochie.
-So put them in a safe place.
-I will.
-Where?
-I don't know.
I'll hide them.
-So is Kramer upset?
-I think so.
I mean, he's acting really weird lately.
He's different.
-Just give him the keys back.
-No, I can't.
Is that Kramer?
-Who's there?
-Kramer.
Hey.
Oh, hi.
Oh, you got the.
-No, I am not-- -No, no, it's okay.
It's okay.
I don't care about the keys.
It's my fault.
No, I gave the keys away with my stupidity.
I broke the covenant of the keys.
-Jerry, give him the keys back.
-Elaine.
-Here.
-What are you doing?
-I'm giving him the keys.
-Those are my keys.
-Let go!
Jerry!
No!
-Elaine.
Come on.
Stop it!
Stop it!
I don't want the keys back.
No, I'm glad the way things turned out.
I was clinging to those keys, man Iike a branch on the banks of a raging river and now I have let go.
And I'm free to go with the current to float.
-And I thank you.
-Take the keys.
-I don't want them.
-I want you to have them.
-I don't want them!
I can't.
-Come on.
Take them!
-No!
-Okay.
Now, one more thing.
I would like my keys back.
-Your spare set?
-Yeah, that's right.
-You want them back?
-Yeah, yeah I think it would be for the best.
Gee, Kramer, l. I don't know what to say.
Say yes.
Yes, George, yes.
-Yes?
-Yes.
Should I give you my keys?
Is that the transaction, trading keys?
-Because Elaine has my keys.
-You can get them back.
I suppose I could.
Because you see, George, having the keys to Jerry's apartment that kept me in a fantasy world.
Every time I went over to his house, it was like I was on vacation.
Better food, better view, better TV.
Cleaner.
Oh, much cleaner.
That became my reality.
I ignored the squalor in my own life because I'm looking at life, you see, through Jerry's eyes.
I was living in twilight, George.
Living in the shadows, living in the darkness Iike you.
-Me?
-Oh, yeah.
I can barely see you, George.
All right, stop it, Kramer.
You're freaking me out.
Hi.
Are you ready to order?
-Yeah.
What's the--?
-No, not yet.
Excuse me.
Do you ever yearn?
Yearn?
Do I yearn?
-I yearn.
-You yearn?
Oh, yes.
Yes, I yearn.
Often I sit and yearn.
Have you yearned?
Well, not recently.
I craved.
I crave all the time.
Constant craving.
But I haven't yearned.
-Look at you.
-Oh, Kramer, don't start.
No, no.
You're wasting your life.
I am not.
What you call wasting, I call living.
-I'm living my life.
-Okay, like what?
No, tell me.
-Do you have a job?
-No.
-You got money?
-No.
Do you have a woman?
No.
Do you have any prospects?
No.
You got anything on the horizon?
No.
-You have any action at all?
-No.
Do you have any conceivable reason for even getting up in the morning?
I like to get the Daily News.
George, it's time for us to grow up and be men -not little boys.
-Why?
I'm going to California.
You know, I got the bug.
Yeah, I think I got a touch of something too.
No, the acting bug.
Ever since I was in that Woody Allen movie.
"These pretzels are making me thirsty"?
That was one line.
You got fired.
I know, I know.
But, man, I never felt so alive.
-Now, you coming with me?
-No, I'm not.
All right.
Suit yourself.
But let's keep this between us.
We're key brothers now.
You're not really gonna go to California, are you?
Up here, I'm already gone.
He gave me his spare keys and now he wants my keys, so I need mine back from you.
Because you have his keys?
Why does he need yours?
I don't know, he said he wants to be my key brother.
-That's ridiculous.
-That's Kramer.
I'll give you back your spare keys, but now I want mine back.
What for?
-Because I'll give them to Jerry.
-Jerry?
Why?
-Because he gave me his.
-So what?
So if he has my keys, I should have his.
I don't see why if you have his -he should have yours.
-I just said the same thing.
-What?
-What?
I'll give you my keys, but I don't have them here.
Can I have mine to give to Kramer?
Yeah, okay, I'll go get them.
What are you doing?
Would you just put that down?
I gotta get some new friends.
-Did you bring the keys?
-Yes.
But I still don't feel right about letting you into Kramer's.
This could be an emergency.
-You shouldn't have taken his keys.
-I tried to give them back.
-How'd the Mets do?
-They lost.
-Kramer!
-Come on, open it up.
-Kramer?
-Hello, boys.
-Hello, Newman.
-Are you looking for someone?
Don't play coy with me, I'm not in the mood.
Coy?
I'm not being coy.
-ls he being coy?
-Yeah, coy.
You're being coy.
Now, where's Kramer, Newman?
-Who?
-Listen, Tiny I wanna know where Kramer is, and I wanna know now!
-Hit me, Seinfeld, I got witnesses.
-Turn around, George.
-Sure.
-George?
Tell me where Kramer is or we'll do this the hard way!
-Help!
Help!
-Where's Kramer?
-Help!
-What's going on?
-They're gonna beat me up.
-No, we're not.
We're trying to find Kramer.
You want to know what happened to Kramer?
I'll tell you.
He was ticked off about the keys.
Yeah, that's right, about the keys.
-Thought he got a bad rap.
-Bad rap?
-Yeah, from you.
-Me?
You heard me.
So he packed a grip and he split for the coast.
La-la land.
L.A. L.A.?
I never should have taken his keys away.
He drove me to it, I had no choice.
He wouldn't take them back.
Elaine, you saw it.
Remember?
I said, "Take the keys back".
He wouldn't do anything.
You saw it.
Didn't you see it?
Yeah, yeah, I saw it.
I mean, it was complete bull-- But I saw.
-What?
-No, what'd you say?
Nothing.
I didn't say anything.
Oh, you didn't see it?
Yeah, I saw it.
I saw it.
-I saw it.
Yep.
-I heard you say something there.
-I didn't say anything.
-I'm calling Kramer's mother.
I don't know what you said, but it was something.
I heard something.
Hello?
Hello, Mrs. Kramer?
Mrs. Kramer?
Could you turn the music down?
Could you turn the music down?
-Ask her about Kramer.
-She's drunk out of her mind.
Oh, my keys.
This is perfect.
Elaine, are you there?
It's me.
I'm locked out.
I need my spare keys.
Where are you?
I'm at the coffee shop.
Hey!
You ever been in an accident?
About five years ago.
I was going down this very road.
Same time of day, going about the same speed I'm going now.
There was a rock in the road.
It couldn't have been more than a pebble.
Never really saw it.
Lost control of the bike, went flying about a hundred feet.
Came down right on my head.
Cracked it wide open.
Blood and stuff just splattered all over the road there.
Broke every bone in my face.
You know, when they found me my eyes were hanging out of their sockets.
Yeah, they pronounced me dead at the scene.
Was in a coma for.
Well, they told me about a year.
Said I'd be a vegetable for life.
Yeah, but I showed them.
Of course, since then, I always wear a helmet.
Lean.
Lean!
Georgie boy.
Way to come through with the keys.
-Sit down, I'm buying you dinner.
-Look I just don't feel right about letting you into Elaine's apartment.
Don't feel right?
What are you talking about?
I let you into Kramer's.
Now you wanna go into Elaine's.
She entrusted me with her keys.
How can I just let you in?
What is the big deal?
Just because you have someone's spare keys doesn't entitle you to break in.
That's the reason you took Kramer's keys.
You're not even supposed to have Elaine's keys.
You're supposed to give them to her so she can give them to me.
So technically, those are my keys.
If you'd never taken your keys from Kramer he never would have given his to me.
In which case, I wouldn't have had to take mine back from her.
-I want those keys.
-No can do.
-George, I want these.
-Stop it, let go.
-George, I don't want to get physical.
-You wanna fight?
-Wanna fight?
-I'll fight you!
-Let's go.
-Nothing in the face!
-Okay.
-All right.
And then the evil ogre took back the magical keys from the handsome young prince.
Oh, no.
He didn't take back the keys.
-No way.
-Yes.
And then the handsome young prince was cast out into the cruel, cruel world.
Oh, man, what a bummer.
-That ogre dude is pretty cold, huh?
-He's cold.
Let me tell you something, Kramer.
If that ogre dude pulled that crap on me -I'd stab him!
-Wait.
I'd cut him in half!
I'd gut him like a fish, man!
-That's what I'd do.
-Yeah, yeah.
That'd be funny.
Hey, you can drop me here.
Hey, what's the rush, man?
-Well, I got to be going now.
-Hey, Kramer have you ever killed a man?
What do you think?
You think these hands have been soaking in lvory Liquid, huh?
Oh, don't leave, Kramer.
Stay with us.
Oh, you know so much about the world.
We need you.
-Please, Kramer.
-Please, Kramer.
Well, now, Star Cloud-- -Okay, wait a minute.
-Please, Kramer.
-No, no, no.
-Please, Kramer.
See?
You're avoiding the middleman.
You'd give her her keys, which she would give to me.
So instead of giving them to her, you give them to me.
Unfortunately, when she gave you yours, you didn't give her hers.
She'd give them to me because she has mine.
Then I wouldn't have to ask you for hers so that I could get mine.
You're right.
How did I miss that?
Maybe because it's a crock of sh-- -What's that?
-Nothing.
-I heard something.
-Didn't say anything.
So how long you been driving this thing?
Going on four years.
Well, nothing's sexier than a woman behind the wheel of a semi.
Nothing?
Well.
Listen to you.
You're quite the sweet talker.
I always wanted to drive the big rigs.
I used to watch those commercials during reruns of Gomer Pyle.
-You wanna give it a try?
-Really?
-Do you know how to double-clutch?
-Yeah.
-Well, come on.
-Wait a minute.
Wait.
Okay.
All right.
They were in here.
I saw her put them in here.
Well, this is great.
-What do they look like?
-Like keys.
They look like keys, George.
They look exactly like keys.
"What do they look like"?
-They're obviously not here.
-They've got to be here.
Jerry, unless I pull down on this statuette and a hidden wall opens up we have checked every square inch of this apartment.
What is this?
-"Murphy Brown"?
-What?
-"By Elaine Benes"?
-What?
Elaine's writing a Murphy Brown?
-Let me see this.
-Wait a second.
-Let me just look at it.
-Wait.
-Give me half!
-All right, here!
Why didn't she tell us?
Elaine is writing a sitcom?
-You-- You weasels!
-What?
-What?
-How dare you!
-We hardly read anything.
-lt was funny.
Who gave you permission to come in and just go through my things?
-You thought it was funny?
-Well, you know -from what I saw-- -Well, it's just a first draft!
I was locked out.
I'm just trying to get my keys.
-Why did you let him in?
-He forced me to.
-I did not!
-Yes, you did!
-You, get out!
Get out!
-Wait, I need my spare keys.
Oh, here's your damn keys.
You keep them.
-I don't want them anymore.
-Good.
I want my keys back from you.
-I can't hold them?
-No, you can't be trusted.
All right, all right.
Fine!
-And I don't want you to hold mine.
-Good, I won't!
Good, don't.
-Are these my keys?
-These aren't my keys.
-Whose are these?
-I don't know.
No, those are yours.
I just thought I could write it.
Is that something you wanna do?
I don't know.
Those writers make a lot of money.
What?
Let me tell you something about show business.
-I can't believe it.
-It's hard work.
You don't just write a Murphy Brown.
You gotta watch the show, get a sense of the characters how they relate to each other.
Okay, can I just watch the show?
Oh, God, what an ass-- What did you say?
I didn't say anything.
I heard something.
Elaine, Elaine, it's Kramer!
Kramer's on Murphy Brown!
-Kramer's on Murphy Brown!
-Look, there he is!
He's sitting at the desk!
Hi, I'm Murphy Brown.
-You must be my new secretary.
-Good morning, Miss Brown.
-And you are?
-I'm Steven Snell.
-Snell.
-Yes.
Well, hello, Mr. Snell.
Steven.
-Steven.
-Yes.
Are you familiar with this computer system?
Oh, I'm familiar, yes.
Steven Snell, I know people and I have a very good feeling about you.
Yes.
So I fly a lot.
I was on a plane the other day and I was wondering are there keys to the plane?
Do they need keys to start the plane?
Maybe that's what those delays on the ground are sometimes, at the gate.
Maybe the pilot's up in the cockpit going: "Oh, I don't believe this.
Oh, my God I did it again".
They tell you it's mechanical.
They don't want to come on the PA system: "Ladies and gentlemen we're gonna be delayed here a little while.
I. Oh, God, this is so embarrassing.
I left the keys to the plane in my apartment".
You see technicians, you think they're servicing it but they're looking for the magnet Hide-A-Key under the wing.
"Maybe he left it up there somewhere".
