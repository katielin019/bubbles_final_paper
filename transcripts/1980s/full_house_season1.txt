{START OF EPISODE 1}
Let's go, Mom.
Your bags are in the cab.
The baby's sleeping like a baby.
Oh, my angels.
Oh, I'm going to miss you.
Honey, Grandma's gotta go.
- Sweetheart, I'm just gonna miss you so.
- Grandma's really gotta go.
Oh, boy, does Grandma gotta go.
Oh, you know, Danny, I don't have to go back home.
Mom, this isn't how we rehearsed this last night.
Let's take a little walk, okay.
Now, you know as well as I do that.
Mom look it's time to go home.
You've been taking care of us ever since Pamela died.
I don't know how we'd have made it the past three months without you.
But Dad needs you too.
You remember Dad, don't you?
Your husband.
Kind of balding and glasses.
Wears his boxer shorts up around his neck.
Mom, I've got everything under control.
Help is moving in today.
Well, if you need me, I'm on the next plane.
Thank you, Mom.
- Okay.
- Bye, Grandma.
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye.
- Oh, my angels.
- Oh, Grandma!
- I love you.
- Come on.
Goodbye, sweetheart.
Goodbye, Grandma.
- Bye.
Bye.
- Bye, Grandma.
Okay.
Are we gonna have fun, or what?
Hey, let's see some smiles.
Everything is gonna work out super great.
Your Uncle Jesse's moving in.
My best friend Joey is moving in.
And you know what?
That means that you two are gonna get to be roommates.
Isn't that exciting?
I can wear all D.J.'s clothes.
Do I have to share my room with her?
Honey, it's gonna be just like having a slumber party.
Yeah, with only one guest who never leaves.
- Hey, hey, look alive.
Uncle Jesse's here.
- Uncle Jesse!
Uncle Jesse!
All right.
Hello!
D.J., how you doing?
That tooth in yet?
- No.
- That's okay.
One less to brush.
Hey, Jesse, you missed breakfast.
Where you been?
I'm sorry.
Last night after my gig at the Smash Club I go for a cruise on my Harley, right?
Next thing I know, I'm in Reno.
It was dark, who would've known.
Then I happened to wander into this show, Razzle Dazzle '87.
Much better than Razzle Dazzle '86, by the way.
I see this incredible showgirl, Vanessa, right?
Our eyes meet.
Ba-boom!
This lightning bolt of passion shoots across the casino.
Turns out, Vanessa's on her way to the Philippines to do a Bob Hope special and is dying for one last night of good old American-- Food.
Food.
She was-- She was hungry, right?
Oh, yeah, she was starving.
Only we never got a chance to eat because she had to turn her feathers in.
Uncle Jesse, let's play ballerina.
Uncle Jesse doesn't wanna play ballerina.
Yes, he does.
- No, he doesn't.
- Yes, he does.
- No, he doesn't.
- Yes, he does.
How do you play ballerina?
Dance.
Okay, that was fun.
Here's more fun.
Catch me.
- Pose!
- Pose, okay.
- Turn around.
- All right.
- On your tippytoes.
- Tippytoes, right.
You need practice.
We'll do this every day.
- Hi, Joey.
- Hi, gang.
Joey, buddy, this is the best, your moving in.
Thanks.
This works out perfect.
I move into a place with a washing machine on the exact day I run out of clean clothes.
Jesse, long time no see.
Now, be honest.
Did you ever think we'd be roommates?
Not once.
I love this guy.
Danny, there's no way all my stuff will fit into a room this tiny.
Joey, this is not a tiny room.
This is a large alcove.
In fact, this is a large alcove that you're living in for free.
Now that I take a close look at it, it's enormous, 'normous, 'normous.
We are gonna have so much fun.
Aren't we, kids?
Think we could catch Grandma at the airport?
Nice, huh?
Roomy.
Not overly masculine?
Oh, golly, it's swell.
Know what would look great by the window?
Barbie's Dream House.
We've got one.
Look, Jesse, I just want you to know that having you and Joey here really means a lot to me.
Knowing somebody's here who cares about the girls.
You know, they're so happy you're here.
God bless you.
You're hugging me in a room with pink bunnies.
- I'm sorry.
I'm an emotional guy.
- It's all right.
Okay, let's face it.
I'm a lean, mean, hugging machine.
Okay.
Danny, listen Pam was my big sister.
And I loved her very much.
And I love your kids.
And I'm happy to do what I can.
You're hugging me again.
Listen, you and me, we'll sit down.
We'll set aside a special time for hugging.
But not now.
Oh, great.
I live in Webster's room.
Rule number one: Never touch my stuff.
You should be taking notes.
Rule number two: Never set foot on my half of the room.
How do I get out of here?
Easy.
You jump out the window and climb down the tree.
I don't think so.
- Suit yourself.
- I'll find a way out.
Stephanie, what are you doing?
Just hanging around.
Come on, honey, get down from there.
All right.
Limbo.
No way.
This is a nightmare.
D.J., honey, I told you.
Everything is gonna work out super great.
I'm sorry, I've gotta get to the station.
Watch my sports report this afternoon.
Today starts my two-part series entitled: "Boxers: Highly Skilled Athletes or Bullies in Shorts"?
Can I have a piggyback ride?
Sure, honey.
Hop on.
All right.
Now, the baby's schedule is on the refrigerator.
You guys can handle this?
- Sure.
- We'll take care of the kid.
Told you I'd find a way out.
Oh, Michelle, little baby-waby.
What's the matter?
Uncle Jesse, what are we gonna do?
First, we stop talking like a munchkin.
Hey, shut up!
Wait.
I'll handle this.
I'm a comic.
It's my nonpaying job to cheer people up.
Hi, Michelle.
It's me, Kermit the Frog.
Now, you don't wanna cry, do you?
Hi, it's me, Pee-wee Herman.
Do you wanna go to my playhouse?
Wait.
She'll love it.
I call it "The Sprinkler".
Tough room.
Jesse, what if she needs to be - changed?
- Check it out.
Go.
We have a winner.
- Now what?
- Joseph, put yourself in her place.
What would you want done?
- I've never changed a diaper.
- Me neither.
At least you touched one.
All right, look out.
I'll show you how it's done.
Come here, child.
You believe this guy?
- All right, make yourself useful.
- I'll take the south end.
Good.
- Watch out.
- Okay.
- Step one, step two.
- Step one, step two.
Okay, good.
Look out.
Okay, keep her coming.
Showtime.
- Where do we put the baby?
- Where do we put the child?
The pot.
Over here.
Joey, this is a living thing.
You don't just stick it in a pot.
Use a meat rack.
I'm an idiot.
Come on.
- Okay.
- All right.
Good.
- All right.
Great.
- Settle down here.
There we go.
Are you gonna cook Michelle?
- We're changing her diaper.
- Oh, then how do you roast a turkey?
Steph, Joey and I are busy.
Joey, strip her.
All right.
Careful, there.
You're in control.
All right.
Slide it off and-- Good thinking, Joey.
Keep it fresh.
- Okay, hold her up.
I'll clean her off.
- Good idea.
Come on, Michelle.
All right.
You're missing, you're missing!
All right, come on.
Gently now, gently now, gently.
There we go.
This is great.
We should be mothers.
- Oh, yeah.
- All right, just dry her off.
Okay, fan her.
- Fan her fanny.
- Fan her fanny.
- Fan her fanny.
- Fan her fanny.
You know, these babies have it made.
I would kill for this kind of service.
- All right, diapers.
- Diapers, diapers.
- Where are the diapers?
- Diapers.
Hey, superabsorbent.
Bring it over.
- Okay.
- Now what?
- Okay, spin her.
- Spin her.
- Spin her.
- Spin her.
All right, now we'll wrap her up in this.
Come on.
Put her right in here.
- It's too easy.
- Works for me.
- You spill some juice on the counter?
- Just wipe it up with Baby Tidy Bottom.
Not bad, but next time try these.
Steph, why did you wait till now to give us the diapers?
Nobody asked me.
Hey, guys, how'd it go today with--?
What happened?
What's with all the dirty baby clothes?
I'm sorry, but every time we fed her, she'd drool or dribble or spit up.
Your baby's a pig.
- Hi, Jesse.
- Vanessa.
Have mercy.
I thought you were supposed to go to the Philippines.
Well, I am, but the airport's fogged in.
So is that offer to stay with you anytime still good?
Oh, it's more than good.
It's amazing.
Hi, Uncle Jesse.
Ready for more ballerina?
- We'll play it later, okay?
- Okay.
It's later.
Catch me.
- Pose!
- Pose!
Why don't you go upstairs and play ballerina with your big sister.
I can't.
She moved out.
Stephanie, honey, what do you mean, "She moved out"?
She's gone.
She rolled up her crepe paper and took off.
Okay.
Everybody follow me.
You lost my daughter?
I went to work for seven hours, and you lost 33 percent of my children?
Joey, call the police.
Jesse, search the neighborhood.
I'm gonna call D.J.'s friends.
And I'll go get D.J. - Stephanie, honey.
- Yes, daddy?
Sweetheart, do you know where D.J. is?
- Why didn't you say something sooner?
- Nobody asked me.
- D.J., can I talk to you?
- Kimmy, hang on.
I'm talking to Kimmy Gibbler.
She called me on her phone from her own room.
She has three sisters.
D.J., you don't wanna live in the garage.
- It's filthy, it's stuffy-- - You want some fresh air?
Donna Jo, I want you back inside right now, this instant.
Is that okay?
No, thank you, Dad.
So, Kimmy, where were we?
Nice job, Dad.
Been reading Cosby's book?
Cosby.
I'll handle this.
Hello there, small, childlike person.
If you move back into the house, you can have a big, juicy bowl of Jell-O.
No, Kimmy, that's not really him.
I'll call you later.
Daddy, the baby's crying.
She's got that thirsty look in her eyes.
Okay, honey, I'll be right up.
Joey, would you mind warming up the baby's bottle?
Well, not at all.
Although, with this particular baby it might be simpler just to pour the formula directly into the diaper.
Well, think about it.
D.J.'s all set and Vanessa's upstairs waiting so best of luck to both of you.
No, look, Jesse, I gotta check on the baby.
Won't you stay here and talk to D.J.?
I'll be right back.
You're her uncle.
Try to be parental or something.
Parental?
That's cool.
I can be parental.
I got parents.
- Can I help you?
- Yes.
You can move your little bod back in the house.
Look, D.J., I don't blame you for wanting your own room but you gotta understand this world is not a perfect place.
Bruce Willis has a record deal.
But then a Vanessa shows up, and it all evens out.
- You know?
- Yeah.
- Good.
So you'll move back in?
- No.
All right.
I'll speak the language you understand.
- Five bucks if you move back in.
- Fifty.
- Ten.
- Forty-nine.
A buck?
You went down a buck?
Okay, it's back up to 50.
All right.
My final offer: Twenty bucks.
Twenty-one.
Vanessa's waiting.
- All right, D.J.'s moving back in.
- She is?
Fantastic.
What'd you do?
I have a very special way with kids.
Jesse, hang on.
Vanessa's not upstairs.
Where's Vanessa?
Well.
She's history.
What did you do with Vanessa?
Nothing.
I just told her, with three little girls in the house I thought it'd be better if she slept on the couch, and she left.
You hate me, don't you?
D.J. Vanessa's gone.
Deal's off.
I want my money back.
- What money?
- The money Uncle Jesse paid me to move back in.
That's your special way with children.
You buy them off?
It works.
Kid, money.
Fine.
I have other sources of income.
I'll go back to my new room and have a garage sale.
D.J., wait.
D.J. Here, take Michelle.
Come with me, honey.
Don't even think about it.
D.J honey, I can't let you have a garage sale.
What if I give you 10 percent of the profits.
D.J., come here.
Can't you just try sharing a room with your sister?
Your mom was always so good at this stuff.
I'd come home from work, and everything was always perfect.
D.J how would Mom have handled this?
She would've caught me before I moved into the garage.
Mom knew everything I did before I did it.
What is it, honey?
It's just not fair.
First I lose my mom, then Grandma leaves.
Now I even lose my own room.
Everything keeps disappearing.
I know exactly how you feel.
And I know how much you girls miss your mother because I miss her too.
Very much.
But you still got me.
You got me too.
You got Michelle, and you have your Uncle Jesse and Joey.
D.J., we're still a family.
And now is when we really need to stick together.
D.J., you and I, we go back a long time.
Ten years.
The 10 happiest years of my life.
So look, it's up to you.
Either you move back inside, or all five of us are moving into the garage.
But nothing is gonna break up this team.
- I'll move back in.
- I love you, angel.
You too, little ballerina.
Hey, Michelle.
Michelle.
Can you say "Uncle Jesse"?
That's it.
You said "Uncle Jesse".
Starting tomorrow, use the toilet like the rest of us.
Good news, Uncle Jesse.
Our deal's back on.
- It's okay.
I'll put it on your tab.
- All right.
Is this working out great or what?
These girls are crazy about you.
Oh, sure.
I dance around and give them money.
- Now what's the problem?
- There's no problem.
She's singing.
- Michelle loves music.
- Music?
I'll handle this.
Everybody sing along.
Let's take a walk.
All right, take it down, guys.
Wilma!
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
- All right.
- And the diaper is on.
Beautiful!
17 minutes.
We beat our old record by 37 minutes.
- Baby wipe.
- Baby wipe.
Hold it.
I'm about to make a quantum leap in diaper theory.
- Go with it.
Go with it.
- If we triple the diaper we get three times the protection, but we change her one-third as often.
Loving it.
Loving it.
We put two diapers together, and Michelle Tanner, come on down!
The other way to go is to tie a Hefty bag around her waist.
That way we'd only have to change her on trash day.
Junior jammie time.
- It's you.
- All right.
Here we go.
We put the leg in like so.
We simply.
We tie.
We tie.
We simply tie like this.
- Very nice.
- Whoa, snag in the plan.
I suggest we go with a lovely two-piece ensemble from Baby Armani.
Using your head, Joseph.
Using your head.
All right.
Hey.
Here we go.
Yeah.
- Oh, yuppie baby.
- Oh, this is good.
Okay, I got the girls in.
Gentlemen, Tarzan, who was raised in the jungle by apes went to bed in better shape than that baby.
Big deal.
You're talking about a guy who wore diapers his entire life.
I appreciate the effort, but I'll take it from here.
Oh, yeah, sure, now that all the work is done.
Good night, Michelle.
Good night, Uncle Jesse.
Next time you see me, I'll have a big surprise for you.
I don't care how many diapers I have on.
Give me my kid.
You really are a good sport.
- Hi, Uncle Jesse.
- How you doing, kid?
- What's happened to my room?
- Looks pretty cool, huh?
Look at this, I'm hanging Elvis up right here.
Over my bunnies?
Well, Steph, your bunnies are very pink.
My mom made those bunnies just for me.
Don't you like them?
These bunnies.
I love these bunnies.
I'm sure Elvis had bunnies hanging all over Graceland.
Okay, it's riddle time.
What has blond hair, purple pajamas, and is up way past their bedtime?
Elvis?
Steph, the Sandman Express is coming.
All aboard!
You see that?
Any of your ape friends do that for Tarzan?
Last stop, Stephanie's bed.
Thank you, Sandman Express.
And the Sandman Express runs every night.
If I get on now, will you drop me off at the nearest hotel?
Okay, let's say good night.
- All right.
Good night, junior babes.
- Uncle Jesse, tell us a bedtime story.
Uncle Jesse doesn't know any stories.
Yes, he does.
- No, he doesn't.
- Yes, he does.
- No, he doesn't.
- Yes, he does.
I'll make one up!
All right, fellas, help me out here.
We'll make it a game.
Steph, you start the story, and you girls point to us when you want someone to take over.
Okay.
Once upon a time, there was a pretty girl named Cinderella.
Daddy.
And Cinderella wanted to go to this big fancy ball.
And on the way, she wandered into this cabin and she fell asleep in Papa Bear's bed.
I don't think so.
No, wait, honey.
It gets better.
So she's on the bed, she's out like a light, when all of a sudden-- Joey.
When Cinderella woke up, she was real thirsty so she went to 7-Eleven for a Slurpee where she ran into Bullwinkle.
So Bullwinkle says, "Hello, Cinderella.
Would you like to come to the ball with me?
Not only am I a great dancer but you can hang your coat on my antlers".
Kids love this stuff.
So-- Uncle Jesse.
Cinderella, Bullwinkle, they get married, right?
They go on The Newlywed Game and they win a grand prize selected especially for them.
Good night.
- Daddy.
- Until the Big Bad Wolf came over.
And he said, "Open up or I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down.
And I can do it too, because as we all know wolves have an amazing lung capacity".
- Joey.
- So-- Uncle Jesse.
So the wolf, the moose, the babe-- They all fell in love, right?
They moved to Sweden, where people are a lot more cool about that sort of thing.
And that's the end of the story.
Good night and goodbye.
No monsters, no witches, but that story was very scary.
Okay, sweetheart.
It's time to go to bed.
- Can I ask one more favor?
- Sure, honey.
What is it?
Study these storybooks.
We'll talk about them in the morning.
Okay, who wants Puddleduck and the Quack Quack Gang?
- Read it.
- Read it.
Joey, Danny, how you guys doing?
Good night.
Hold it, guys.
Red light.
Guys, the only way that three adults can leave the house at the same time is if three children are with them.
Two adults can leave.
One adult can leave.
Three, two or one child can leave with one to three adults but three adults can never leave with less than three children.
Got it?
Look, that's all fascinating, but I've got band rehearsal.
Yeah, and I have a 10:30 slot at the Laugh Machine.
I have to do the sports at 10:00.
I'm sorry, Jesse.
What do you mean, "I'm sorry, Jesse"?
Why not "I'm sorry, Joey," or "I'm sorry, Danny"?
Because I have an actual job that pays money.
And I bring the gift of laughter into the world at 10:30.
Yes, well, I make music.
Songs that touch people's hearts, that penetrate their very souls.
Now, how can you compare that to telling jokes?
Are you seriously trying to tell me that music is more important than comedy?
- You got it, pal.
- Two words: Ozzy Osbourne.
Two more words: Rip Taylor.
The Partridge Family.
Anyone on Hee Haw.
Charo.
Bozo.
- Hey, Bozo did some brilliant work.
- Oh, right, right.
The early Bozo was real good.
I'm sorry.
Okay, we'll settle this the only truly fair way.
Ready?
Go!
Once again, comedy kicks music's butt.
I'm sorry.
All three girls are sleeping like angels.
I know I can trust you.
If there's even-- Yeah, yeah.
Go live your life.
Hey, babe, it's fine.
I'll just give up my dreams of success in the music business.
I'll sit home and read Hunny-bunny in the Wee Little Glen.
- I couldn't put it down.
- Get out of here.
- Hi, Uncle Jesse.
- Hi, girls.
Girls.
You're supposed to be in bed.
Girls!
Girls, aren't you supposed to be in bed, dreaming about Tweety Bird or Big Bird or Larry Bird or something?
If we get hungry, Dad always makes sure we have a late-night snack.
We're gonna have ice-cream sundaes and chocolate milk.
- And cookies.
- Freeze, chick.
All right.
I know.
I'm pretty hip, here.
You guys think I'm an idiot or something?
Let me tell you something.
I know what's going on here.
Your dad's gone, and it's "let's take advantage of the babysitter" time.
Well, I got news for you, girls.
Your Uncle Jesse's a little too sharp to be taken on that kind of ride.
You have ice cream and chocolate milk.
No cookies.
Okay.
Z, my name is Zippy And my husband's name is Zorro We come from San Francisco With a carload of zebras A, my name is Alice-- That's enough jump rope.
Let's do the hand-jive.
Okay, but I can't stop jumping.
I may never sleep again.
Thanks.
Two bowls of ice cream sure gives you a lot of pep, huh?
Does "pep" mean you can't blink?
That's pep.
Party time.
Fellas, I got three little girls upstairs, sound asleep.
Sticks.
Licorice.
All right.
Here we go.
"Jumpin' Jack Flash" in B. Ready.
One, two, three, four!
What's the matter?
Someone out of tune?
Do you guys know any Bangles stuff?
Girls!
You're supposed to be in bed!
- What would your dad say?
- He wouldn't mind.
He'd say we're really lucky to have a chance to listen to the greatest rock band in the world.
Well, yeah, if you put it that way.
Yeah, okay.
Great hair.
Could you show me how to do that?
Sure, it's real easy.
Just sprays right on.
Oh, that's for me.
Oh, I bet my dad forgot to tell you about our 11:00 pizza.
- Hi.
How much?
- $11.50.
Did the cheese slide off or stick to the box?
No.
Keep it.
- Do you mind if I check out the band?
- Come on in.
Open party.
All right, girls.
Listen here, now.
It's almost midnight.
You guys listen to two, three songs max.
You eat your pie then straight to bed, no nonsense.
Boy, are you strict.
Conga!
Boy, are you gonna get it.
Attention, Solid Gold farm team.
It's 12:15, and your hair is purple.
Get down, and I don't mean "get funky".
Boys, boys, boys.
Walk with me.
Talk with me.
- How could you possibly let this happen?
- Hold it.
On behalf of Joey, I would just like to say that Joey is innocent.
Well, it's true I was doing a conga when you walked in but I conga a lot.
My name is Joey, and I am a conga-holic.
Well, it's way past our bedtime.
Come on, Steph.
- Good night, everybody.
- Girls, get back over here.
You're in just as much trouble as they are.
- Dad, I know we're supposed to be-- - D.J., hang on a second.
It's not the girls' fault.
It's mine.
I invited the band over.
I woke the girls up.
I ordered pizza.
I was throwing a party.
I needed chicks.
- Baby alert.
Baby alert.
- You girls get right in bed.
You guys, follow me.
And if that baby's hair is purple.
You were irresponsible.
You were unreliable.
I'll get back to you.
Oh, Michelle.
Honey, it's okay.
Daddy's here.
I see what this is.
Michelle's getting a new tooth.
That really hurts.
I had nothing to do with it.
Poor baby.
Imagine a sharp, pointy, calcified projectile ripping and knifing its way through your soft, tender, inflamed gum tissues.
I say we buy her a pony.
Sometimes a teething ring helps.
Here, Michelle.
Here you go.
Here, honey.
She loves it.
Is this anything like catching the bouquet?
Am I the next one to have a baby?
All right.
Excuse me, fellas.
Let the pro in.
I'll show you how it's done.
All right, little munchkin.
Where does it hurt?
Wait a minute.
Give my finger back, kid.
Well, your brain's not working tonight, but your finger's doing great.
Do me a favor.
I put one of Michelle's teething rings in the freezer.
I'd like a word alone with the alleged babysitter.
I guess it's a bad time to ask for that girl singer's number.
Get out.
Well, well, well.
What, what, what?
Shame, shame, shame.
Feel like I'm being chewed out in the Grand Canyon.
I suppose I should be happy the house is still standing.
I must have been crazy to think you were adult enough to take care of my kids.
You really let me down.
Wait a minute.
Where you going?
I thought I'd call up the Beastie Boys and ask them if they wanna take the girls to the park tomorrow.
You love this, don't you?
Uncle Jesse's the best babysitter we ever had.
Yeah, but I think he's in big trouble.
Get into bed.
No, no.
Your bed!
Girls?
Are you awake?
Dad, is that you?
Is it morning?
D.J., Stephanie, please come over here right now.
Girls, we have a problem with Uncle Jesse.
Oh, no, Dad, we didn't have any problems with Uncle Jesse at all.
I'm sorry.
He was just so irresponsible.
What is this?
Empty bowls and empty cartons.
Oh, now I see what happened.
Uncle Jesse forced ice-cream sundaes and chocolate milk down your throats and then he hid the evidence under your table.
Oh, the sick fiend.
He probably ignored you when you told him no sweets after bedtime, huh?
Probably.
No probably about it, because otherwise you'd be lying.
- You know better than that, don't you?
- Probably.
Well, that does it.
I guess asking Uncle Jesse to move in here was just a big mistake.
In fact, this may be a matter for the police.
Now, sweet dreams, my perfect little angels.
- Daddy.
- Dad.
- We were bad.
- We did everything.
We even ordered the pizza.
We should all go apologize to Uncle Jesse.
You're right.
You go first.
Are you gonna punish us?
Before you answer that.
We saved you a slice of pizza.
Good point, Michelle.
The thing I wonder is, what's life all about anyway?
I mean, 24 hours ago I was a relatively cool guy.
Today I'm a six-foot teething ring.
All right, bedtime.
We're going to my bed.
Come with me.
Come on, let's go.
Okay, hang on.
I'll put it back.
There you go.
Come with me.
- Uncle Jesse?
- Whatever it is, the answer's no.
We just wanted to say thanks for trying to keep us out of trouble.
The only reason we took advantage of you is because you had no idea what you were doing.
From now on, we'll be good and do whatever you say.
Steph, don't get crazy.
We'll try to do better.
You can cover up my bunnies if you want.
That's all right.
Your bunnies are growing on me.
- We really love you.
- Well, I love you girls too.
But next time you pull that stuff on me I'm still gonna love you.
Okay, now either you girls go to bed for real or I'm taking everything out of your room and turning it into a minimart.
- Good night, everybody.
- Good night, Daddy.
- Good night, Michelle and Uncle Jesse.
- Good night, honey.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Want a slice of pizza?
No.
Me and the little leech are gonna try to get some sleep.
I couldn't find Michelle's teething ring, so I got the next best thing: An ice-cold carrot.
What?
I could've brought the fish sticks, but you would've thought I was an idiot.
Look, Jesse I want you to know it was nice of you to take the rap for D.J. and Stephanie.
And I'm real sorry I got so crazy before walking around you going, "Well, well, well".
It's cool, cool, cool.
The girls just mean so much to me.
Especially now, you know, since Pam's gone.
I know what you're saying, man.
I worry about them too.
They're my nieces.
But I don't know nothing about this kid stuff.
Yeah, I know, but both you guys, you gotta remember: Don't be afraid to say no.
Kids need limits.
How am I to know?
I been here 12 hours, you expect me to be Robert Young.
Now, wait, I'm confused.
Is it Robert Young from Father Knows Best or Robert Young, Dr. Welby?
This is gonna take some time but we can make this work if we want it to work.
Jesse, you do want this to work, don't you?
Well, at first I wasn't sure but when I saw that kid telling me I could cover her bunnies up and I was looking at that little baby, counting on me to stop her pain I don't know, I got all warm and tingly-- And somebody stop me.
You know, I'm just happy to be here.
I was an only child.
All I had was imaginary brothers and sisters.
It feels great to be in a real house with real people.
Right, Leon?
Give me my kid.
Okay, Michelle.
It's time to go to bed.
Yeah.
Lullaby and good night And there's more words I'm not sure of.
Conga!
What the hell.
Come on, Leon.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
So, Kimmy, we gotta be the first ones in class tomorrow - to get the seats in the back row.
- Okay.
Why?
- It's the best place to pass notes.
- I love the way your mind works.
This outfit is all wrong.
Tomorrow's the first day of kindergarten and I have nothing to wear.
Your bed is full of clothes.
Yeah, but they're not me.
Well, they're me, but they're the preschool me.
I'll sit anywhere you want as long as it's not near Arthur Wilcox.
- Arthur Wilcox!
- Arthur Wilcox!
Who's Arthur Wilcox?
Steph, please, Kimmy and I are talking about school.
So am I. What if I walk into class wearing a goofy outfit and everyone says: Stephanie Tanner!
Would you stop worrying?
Kindergarten is so easy.
The only thing you have to know is the Pledge of Allegiance.
The what?
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all.
I'm dead meat.
Kimmy, your mom is downstairs.
She said you were supposed to be home a half-hour ago.
That's the third time today.
She's gonna kill me.
Don't panic.
Just set your watch back a half-hour.
I love the way your mind works.
- Uncle Jesse, how do I look?
- Like a bag lady.
What happened to Michelle?
Your sister Michelle tried to eat her dinner by pushing it through her face.
- Yeah, we better give her a bath.
- That's a good idea-- Do we know how?
Sure, it's just like giving a puppy a bath.
- Only, there's a little less tail to clean.
- Right.
- Hey, Joey, the kid's ready.
- So am I. This is the most terrifying shower scene since Psycho.
Hey, it's all right, pal.
Here, you go to your Uncle Joey there.
There you go.
Joey, the baby has better muscle tone than you do.
And what do you bench?
If we missed anything stupid would you start all over?
Girls, get out, go to bed.
Get out of here.
Don't worry.
Joey will do something just as stupid tomorrow.
You got a call from the Laugh Machine.
Somebody got sick.
You have to go on at 9:30 instead of 1:30.
- Jess, what do I open with?
- How about a joke?
Perfect.
Thank God you're here.
I've made a decision.
I'll open with a joke.
- What's my best joke?
- That outfit.
D.J., are you asleep?
I can't tell.
I think I'm blind.
Will you look at one more outfit?
Steph, I've seen your entire wardrobe twice.
Okay.
Wanna listen to the pledge?
I pledge allegiance to the flag of some states of America.
I'm gonna tuck you in.
Very tight.
And to the public, which understands.
With God and liberty.
I'm dead meat.
Okay, she's clean.
You could eat off this baby.
Thanks for helping me out with the baby.
No problem.
I got a date with a dancer, but not till midnight.
Another exotic dancer?
For your information, Joseph, I happen to be dating a ballerina.
Okay, she's a topless ballerina.
Good luck tonight, pal.
Yeah, tonight, 9:30.
This could be the big break I've been waiting for, Jess.
I've been at this comedy stuff since I was 4, when I did my first impression.
Ever since then, all I wanted was to make people happy.
- Is this making any sense?
- Oh, yeah, I know what you're saying.
You're talking about that magical moment when you know what you wanna do with your life.
For me it was at 6.
I turned the TV on, there was Elvis Presley in King Creole.
Naturally, he played a two-fisted, fun-loving, girl-chasing, singing busboy.
They stole that Oscar from him.
Robbed him blind.
Anyway, Elvis made me feel that music was something special, you know?
I gotta be honest with you, when he started singing "Hard Headed Woman" forget about it, I was touched.
I mean, it was like.
I was like this: Jess.
Jess, Jess, you are great.
Man, you got all the moves.
I feel it, you know?
I feel it.
I'm doing this lip thing, which is new.
Sing another song, would you?
Please?
For Michelle.
She loves music.
All right.
I need a scarf.
Here we go.
All right, get a load of this.
Oh, my God.
What?
We were just giving the kid a bath.
Then why isn't she in the tub?
Because Joey's in the tub, and I'm in the tub and there's not enough room for, you know, all of us.
It's obvious.
I really am intruding.
I'm gonna go put Michelle in her crib.
I'm gonna go check on my other girls and just leave you two sailors to your suds and your singing.
Hi, Daddy.
Hi, Dad.
Why is everybody awake?
I'll show you.
I'm ready for school.
Honey, you're ready for the prom.
You said this would be good.
If you can't have fun with your little sister, what's the point in having one?
- Good morning, boys.
- Good morning, Pa, Hoss.
Little Joe.
How'd it go last night?
I started out great, but right in the middle-- No, no, I meant in the bathtub with Hoss.
I finished "Love Me Tender," we did a short medley from "Viva Las Vegas" and I got the hell out of the tub.
Dad, we're all ready.
Girls, I don't wanna brag but Chef Boyar-dad has made some super-great lunches for a super-great first day of school.
And you know what, Stephanie?
For you I've got a brand-new lunch box.
The Jetsons.
Hi, I'm home.
Hi, Jane.
Hi, Elroy.
Hi, Astro.
Hi, George.
How was your first day at work?
And, D.J., for you, I've got a brand-new Barbie lunch box.
I don't do Barbie.
Oh, darn.
Thanks, Dad, but fifth-graders don't carry lunch boxes anymore.
Try to sell it to a first-grader.
Come on, we don't wanna miss our bus.
- I guess not.
- Wait, girls.
Stephanie, honey, are you sure you don't want me to go with you?
Don't worry, Dad.
I'll make sure she's okay.
Yeah.
It'll be fun.
You girls are really growing up.
Stephanie's starting school.
Wait here.
I'm gonna get my video camera.
Don't move.
Okay, just come in when I tell you to.
When I say action.
Okay, give me love.
Action.
My little baby's starting school.
I changed my mind.
I'm not going.
Honey, what do you mean, you're not going to school?
I don't feel good.
Maybe I'll go next year.
- You don't look sick.
- Is that better?
The face is almost there.
Give it kind of a. Like that.
And throw in a real hacking cough.
Come on, you're gonna miss the bus.
Steph, are you okay?
See?
Now you're tricking people.
D.J., you go on ahead.
Steph's nervous about her first day at school.
I'll make sure she gets there.
Okay, Steph, see you there.
Stephanie.
Wait a minute.
Where are you going?
Steph, I wanna talk to you.
Sweetheart, don't you wanna go to school and be smart?
I'll stay home and watch public television.
Come on, Steph, spill your guts.
Why don't you wanna go to school?
Because I don't know anybody.
I'll be all alone.
It'll be real scary.
I won't know anybody and I won't have any friends.
Steph you're gonna make friends, I promise.
You and I, we're gonna go down there together.
Daddy's not gonna leave until everything's all right.
Yeah, you're just nervous because it's your first day.
Yeah, see, first times can be scary, but they can be exciting too.
I remember a real exciting first time for me.
I was 14.
I went out with this incredible college girl, Marisa Delacrew.
We went to the drive-in.
First, I was kind of nervous and a little scared.
But then Marisa, she kind of-- I don't know, she got kind of friendly, and.
Let's just say first times can be great.
Not a helpful story.
But darn entertaining.
Okay.
I came to kindergarten.
We can go home now.
Steph, wait a minute.
Honey, sweetheart.
Baby, don't worry.
You're gonna feel much better as soon as you meet someone.
Oh, look, here comes a real nice little girl right now.
I'm never going back in there again!
Never, never!
No!
Let's wait for another little girl.
One who has a better outlook on life.
I know.
We'll play for a while and ease our way into this, okay?
Come here.
Look, honey, it's a slide.
Your very favorite.
This is like the lollipop they give before the big shot, isn't it?
Oh, no, no, no.
Why didn't I bring a lollipop?
Here.
Come on, honey.
We're gonna play on the slide.
Here we go, this is fun.
Oh, yeah.
That was fun.
Now it's my turn.
Here I go.
Here we go.
Here I go.
If we're having this much fun outside the class just imagine the barrel of monkeys waiting for us inside, huh?
Oh, Michelle.
Honey.
What's wrong, sweetheart?
She's scared too.
See what she did?
Yeah.
She's got a Pamper full of fright.
I'm gonna go change her.
Sweetheart, I want you to wait inside the class, okay?
Okay, but I don't know anybody in there.
Hey, Steph.
What's shaking?
Uncle Jesse, what are you doing here?
Come here, I'll tell you.
I was on my way to work, and since I happen to be a part-time exterminator I thought I'd make sure there are no bugs or varmints in your classroom.
Other than these rug rats.
Look, I made this for you.
What is it?
It's either a dog with no head or an ashtray.
Dog with no head.
Will you stay here and never leave?
What's the matter, no pals yet?
I don't know why.
You look pretty.
You smell okay.
All right, you stay here and get ready to learn some new names, all right?
Attention, all munchkins.
Free milks all around, compliments of the coolest kid in class, Stephanie Tanner.
Make a friend.
Get a free milk.
Great.
Now I have no friends and no milk.
Can't believe that milk scam didn't work.
All right, we'll go to my specialty, personal charm.
Now, you wait here.
I'll be back with your new best friend, okay?
Sit down.
Little girl, how would you like to make a new friend?
Stranger, stranger, stranger!
What is going on here?
Nothing, I'm just trying to help the kids become friends, that's all.
Who are you?
I'm this pretty little girl's father.
Right, Steph?
Okay.
As long as you're here would you come with me to the supply room and kill something with eight legs?
I'll be right back.
This happens all the time.
Everybody loves the exterminator.
- Hi, Stephanie.
- Hi.
Wow.
This place is great.
You got toys and blocks and pin the tail on the donkey.
Sure wish I lived here.
Here, take my place.
Okay, there's only one sure-fire way to make friends.
It's Duck Duck Goose time.
All right, everybody, Stephanie has a great idea.
It's Duck Duck Goose time.
In a circle.
That's right.
We're ducking, we're goosing.
We're having a great time!
All right, okay!
Sitting down, okay!
Yeah, Duck Duck Goose.
My favorite.
Duck, duck, duck.
Goose!
You gotta catch me!
We're having a great time.
Hello.
Go to your chair.
Find your chairs.
Who are you?
I'm this pretty little girl's father.
Okay.
What are you guys doing here?
- Who are you?
- Me?
I'm this adorable little girl's father.
What?
Elizabeth Taylor's daughter had seven fathers.
Danny, more good news.
D.J.'s going over the wall.
Yeah, this dad stuff's a piece of cake.
Here.
Take the little poopster.
Stay right here.
Okay, Daddy, and Daddy and Daddy.
Freeze.
What is this?
I don't wanna jump to conclusions but it appears that what we have is my daughter ditching school throwing away her future, basically becoming a juvenile delinquent.
In a nutshell, yes.
Would you mind if I ask you a question before you knock off a 7-Eleven?
Why are you dropping out of school?
Because they put me in the smart class.
The advanced class?
D.J., that's wonderful.
Dad, it's Geekville, U.S.A. These kids, the first day of school, they brought homework.
And get this, I'm the only blond.
And worst of all, they split me and Kimmy up.
I know you're disappointed, but it's not like you'll never see Kimmy again.
She lives next door.
Dad, you don't understand.
Kimmy and I have always been in the same class.
Now I'm in a room full of eggheads.
They're worse than eggheads.
They're omelet-heads.
D.J., it's the omelet-heads who rule the world.
You really should give this a chance.
- Do you know why?
- Why?
Because if you don't try new things you're never gonna know what you're missing out on.
Bye.
- Bye, Dad.
- Hold it.
- Where do you think you're going?
- Home.
You're not going anywhere.
Nobody's going anyplace unless it's back into those rooms.
- There she is.
- I got this.
- What you two need to understand-- - Dad?
Yes?
Stay.
Let me just talk to my sister alone, okay?
Woman to woman.
I think I can help.
All right, you can talk to her.
But remember, I'm trusting you.
I promise we won't try to make a break for it.
Okay.
Steph.
What's wrong?
No friends.
You can't expect to make friends the first day.
When I started kindergarten, I didn't know anybody either.
What about Kimmy?
We were just in the same class.
But I didn't talk to Kimmy for six months.
Because she's an airhead?
She's not an airhead.
She just hates thinking.
That's probably why we're not in the same class anymore.
I just got stuck in a room full of omelet-heads where I don't know one person.
- It's pretty scary.
- Real scary.
But, Steph, you can't run away every time you're scared.
If you don't try new things, you'll never know what you're missing out on.
Where did I hear that?
Oh, no.
He was right.
- Who was right?
- You don't know him.
Anyways, making new friends takes time.
But you got one really good friend at school already.
Who?
Me.
And I'm right down the hall.
Room seven.
You can't miss me.
I'm the only omelet-head with blond hair.
Thanks.
Steph, I'll go back to my class if you go back to yours, okay?
Okay.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Cereal, cartoons, pajamas.
This is why God created Saturday.
Let's watch MTV.
No.
Let's watch Bugs Bunny.
But, Steph, Bugs Bunny is kid stuff.
We gotta watch Yogi Bear.
But I like Bugs Bunny.
Yeah, but, Steph, every episode is the same.
Elmer Fudd says, "Why, you pesky rabbit".
Then he takes a shot at Bugs.
Then Yosemite Sam comes in, "I hates that rabbit".
And he takes a shot at Bugs.
I mean, with all that shooting going on I don't know why Bugs ever pops his head out of that hole.
Let's face it.
The rabbit has a death wish.
Better than watching Yogi steal the same picnic basket.
Boring.
Morning, kids.
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, Dad.
I don't really see you eating cereal out of pots with wooden implements, do I?
Yes, you do.
Great.
After breakfast, why don't we take this laundry to the bay and beat it against some rocks?
Joey, can you come with me, right now, into the kitchen, please?
What, now?
I'll miss the start of Yogi.
It's not Agatha Christie.
You'll catch up.
Girls, take accurate notes.
It's Howdy Dirty Time.
Joey, the deal we made was, this is your week to take care of the dishes.
I'm just waiting till the dishwasher's full.
There, now we won't be wasting water.
Of course we won't.
There's no room for water.
Boy, what a night.
Jesse, what's going on here?
You said you would do the laundry.
I did.
I did mine.
What about everybody else's laundry?
Looks to me like they haven't touched it, the lazy bums.
Let me tell you this story.
Last night, my band's playing this gig in Chinatown.
A "Sweet and Sour 16 Party," if you will.
Anyway, I'm cruising home on my Harley.
I come to a red light.
I stop.
- Great story.
- And you told it great.
Fellas, I'm building.
I'm building.
Anyway, the light turns green, right?
I try to move.
I can't.
There's something wedged under my tire.
Just then, this runaway street cleaner barrels through the intersection right where I would've been.
I came this close to being a really clean dead guy.
Fellas, I'd like to introduce to you the little dude that saved my life Bubba!
I love this amphibian.
You just hate coming home alone, don't you?
I gotta get my guitar.
Hold Bubba.
Keep him happy.
It just may save your life.
Joey, where are you?
Don't let the girls see.
They'll want to keep him.
- Hide him.
- Where?
- The pot.
- Okay.
- Under the pot.
- Okay.
Great idea.
Okay.
- There you go.
- I don't see a turtle.
- Act casual.
- Oh, yeah.
Nonchalant.
Good word, "nonchalant".
Joey, Yogi may be smarter than the average bear but he's much dumber than the average 3-year-old.
What's that?
That?
That's-- It's dinner.
It's roast beef.
Yeah.
Roast beef.
And where is our roast beef going?
It's going to the oven.
Roast beef comes from turtle?
Not my turtle, it doesn't.
- I love this amphibian.
- I love him too.
Can we keep him?
Of course we can keep him.
Bubba's a hero.
- We'll take care of him for you.
- All right.
Are you sure, honey?
That's a big responsibility.
- No problem.
- Let's go get Bubba settled.
He looks a little pasty.
What a great day.
We get a turtle and Grandma's coming to visit.
Stephanie.
Sweetheart.
Honey.
Baby.
- Did you just say Grandma's coming?
- That's what she said on the phone.
Well, why didn't you say something?
Nobody asked me.
Steph, it's not possible for me to ask you every question.
Do you know how many questions there are in the world?
Eight.
What time is Grandma coming, honey?
Her plane gets in at 5:12, sugar hips.
Sweetheart, go upstairs and play with Bubba.
Joey, how did you know about my mother?
I answered the phone when she called.
Why didn't you say something?
Nobody asked me.
Found a home for Bubba.
It's calm, cool, comfortable.
Nobody flush, okay?
All right, I'll shred him lunch.
I'll swat him dessert.
Jesse, forget about the turtle.
My mom's on her way.
Your mom's coming back?
She just moved out.
She's coming to check up on me.
She doesn't think I can take care of things.
What?
The place looks great.
You don't understand.
All my life, somebody's taken care of me.
First it was my mom, then I got married and it was Pam.
For the first time, I wanna prove to my mom and myself that I can take care of my family on my own.
Just me.
That's why I desperately need your help.
What do you want us to do?
- Jesse, take another shot at the laundry.
- All right.
Joey, see if you can wedge some detergent into the dishwasher.
I'm gonna mop the floor.
Bad news, Danno.
We're out of detergent.
Ditto on the dish soap.
And we're out of floor wax.
Let's go shopping.
Whoa!
- You're in your pajamas.
- I know.
I just woke up.
Oh, I get it.
I gotta go put clothes on.
Gee, I wish you could wear pajamas at the market.
He may need his mother.
D.J., let's go.
Stephanie, hurry up.
Grandma's gonna be here in T-minus seven hours and counting.
Can't we wait till Yogi's over?
Tape it.
Of course I'm gonna tape it.
I tape all of them.
It's just that Yogi is so much better live.
All right, we need turtle chow, leafy green.
There's no such thing as Fly Helper, is there?
No, okay.
I got baby diapers, baby wipes, extra baby clothes, and baby's backpack.
- Great.
- Here's baby apple juice - and baby biter biscuits.
- Wonderful.
The baby loves music.
Do you think we should bring along the organ?
I got it covered.
I'm bringing her crib blaster.
Okay, troops move out!
- Don't forget Mr. Pandy.
- That's right, honey.
Michelle won't go anywhere without Mr. Pandy.
Let's go.
Everybody move it.
I am so sorry.
You won't remember this, will you?
How many times do I have to tell you?
Make a tinkle before you leave the house.
- Coming up.
- Coming up.
It's up.
- Coming up.
- Coming up.
Don't we have one of these?
I'll take Michelle.
I hate this thing.
Only five hours before my mom shows up.
Here's the plan: I'll do the kitchen.
- Joey, do the living room.
- Jess, do the bedrooms.
Now, who's gonna do the toilets?
- Oh, girls.
- Oh, girls.
Giddyup, Bubba.
Giddyup.
Come on.
Come on.
Can I go next?
Look at Bubba.
Have you ever seen a turtle that good with kids?
D.J., go put Annie Oakley in her bunkhouse.
Jesse, find a corral for Trigger.
Joey, I'm all out of cowboy metaphors, so let's put away the grub.
I was wrong.
I had one left.
Hey, we've been shopping all morning.
How about a little Yogi break?
Sit down with your family, here.
Relax.
Watch the bear.
All right, but we're just gonna watch until Yogi steals a picnic basket.
Okay.
He's got one.
Hi.
- Grandma!
- Grandma!
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
My granddaughter is a turtle.
Michelle needs your love now more than ever.
Give me that.
This turtle saved my life.
Bubba, Claire.
Claire, Bubba.
- Hi.
- I love this amphibian.
Isn't he cool?
Pet his head, Grandma.
He really likes that.
He's a reptile.
Hey, back off.
He's been nothing but nice to you.
Mom, what are you doing here so early?
Joey said you'd be in at 5:12.
Try 12:05.
I guess you had to find out sooner or later.
My name is Joey, and I'm a time dyslexic.
I would have told you earlier, but I'm just not sure when earlier is.
Girls, will you just go on upstairs and clean your room.
How did she know our room is a mess?
Grandma vision.
Mom, don't worry.
We're on the verge of a major cleanup.
- Aren't we, boys?
- We were, but now what's the point?
No one cleans a house like your ma.
Right, Joseph?
- You're awesome, Mrs. Tanner.
- Yeah.
So why don't we just get out of your way, and Claire, go nuts.
Absolutely.
We'll catch a movie or something.
And, Mrs. Tanner, if you happen to finish up before we get back I'd just like to leave you with these two words: Lamb chops.
Don't listen to him, Mom.
You can cook anything you want.
Honey, we're home.
Boys, we got some trouble.
I'd say we got trouble.
Look at this place.
It's a pigsty.
I think your ma has lost her touch.
She doesn't wanna clean up our mess.
She wants us to do it.
She wants us to do it?
What's the matter?
Can't you handle your ma?
You wimp.
You're totally mommy-whipped.
I suppose you'd handle your mom differently?
I play my ma like a piano.
Well, I'm glad you're back.
Come on in.
Your mom called our moms?
- Hello, Jesse.
- Hi, Joey.
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, Mom.
I thought that Irene and Mindy would be very interested to see how you keep house.
Okay, piano man.
Why don't you show the wimp how to tickle those ivories.
Ma.
Jesse.
Can I make you some tea?
- Bravo.
Bravo.
- Stop it.
No tea, thank you-- Oh, tuck in your shirt.
- Ma!
- Oh, Jesse.
All right.
I remember when you were 8 years old.
- Ma, please don't tell that story.
- No.
Tell.
Tell.
We love stories.
I'll never forget it.
My little Jesse tugged on my apron and said: "Mommy, can I please help you iron"?
I said, "Sure.
Finish the sleeve".
Must have been like when Babe Ruth picked up his first bat.
To this day, he's the only one I'll trust with my chiffon blouses.
To iron or wear?
Hey, man, to iron.
Enough of this talking.
You boys have a lot of work to do.
So where's the vacuum cleaner?
Vacuum cleaner?
We'll handle this.
Mom, let's show them "The Hoover".
Great.
You're just gonna love this.
- Mindy.
- Of course.
Now, Joey.
There was a time to have fun and a time to be serious.
Listen, girls.
I think one of us should be here at all times to see that things go properly.
After all, this is where our grandchildren live.
You are so right.
I can be here Monday through Wednesday.
- I'm free Thursdays and Fridays.
- That's wonderful.
And I can fly in - on the weekends.
So it's all settled.
- Terrific.
Boys, we are staring into the jaws of a never-ending living hell.
- What?
- No offense.
Moms, I don't blame you for treating us like children.
Because sometimes that's how we act.
When we moved in here, we know we had some responsibilities to do but we haven't followed through.
From now on, we're really gonna buckle down.
Mothers, I have a proposition for you: You all go shopping for a couple of hours.
And if this place isn't clean by the time you get back you can all move in here and just run our lives forever.
Deal?
Deal.
Okay, there's the bathroom.
Yep.
There's the bathroom.
Same place it was last time we didn't clean it.
Here's a thought: Let's see if the girls finished their room?
Loving it.
What happened?
There's been a bedroom tornado.
We lost something.
Might that be your minds?
We lost: What exactly is: --is what you say when you don't wanna say Bubba.
You lost Bubba?
He loves that amphibian.
We're really sorry.
We turned our backs for one minute, and he was gone.
It's okay, girls.
I'm sure Bubba is somewhere in the house.
Guys, we're gonna turn this house upside down until we find that turtle.
Ready, go.
- Bubba!
Bubba!
Bubba!
- Bubba!
Bubba!
Where are you?
No Bubba?
No Bubba.
Uncle Jesse, me and Steph will buy you another turtle.
You can have all my money: $2.58.
My advice is don't clean anymore.
Just move.
We'll be right with you.
We're having a little family problem here.
We'll look for Bubba for the rest of our lives.
It's all right.
Bubba's work here was done.
I'm sure he's out in the world saving other lives.
You mean, you're really not mad at us?
You don't think we'd get mad over a stinky turtle?
If you had four armpits and were an inch off the ground, how would you smell?
Girls-- Girls, I know you feel bad.
But that's because you love Uncle Jesse and you feel like you let him down.
I know that losing Bubba was an accident.
You've gotta understand we're right behind you no matter what you do.
And if you ever have a problem, we'll be there for you.
That's right.
And if we have a problem, you'll be there for us too, right?
All right.
Come here, you little munchkins.
Give us a hug.
All right!
Next.
That is so sweet.
All right.
Enough of this warmth junk.
We're gonna have a great time living here, right, girls?
- Yes, we are.
- You bet.
Just a minute, ladies.
We would like another shot at this, please.
Why don't you take the girls to the zoo for three hours?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
We got work to do.
All right?
All right.
And break!
- I split my pants!
- Can't stand my pants.
Okay, guys.
We made it with five seconds to spare.
Come on.
Everybody up.
- Let's go.
Five - All right.
Okay.
- four, three - Cool.
Casual.
Calm.
- two, one.
- All right.
We completely lost track of the time.
It's immaculate!
Grandma Irene, does this mean hell is freezing over?
Go on, find a speck of dirt, a microbe of filth.
I double dare you.
- Okay.
- All right.
That's not where those go.
You take grandma goodies upstairs and put them in the toy box now.
- Whoa.
- Whoa.
And he used to be the easy one.
Hold it!
You're about to enter a sterile environment.
Don't even think about it.
Ma, what about those creases, huh?
Jesse, you still have your touch.
Perfect.
Everything is just perfect.
Look, Mom.
You could eat off these dishes.
Congratulations.
I am really proud of all of you.
Oh, honey.
Sorry.
Bank's closed.
Can you pay me in cash?
Mom, I'd like you to meet my fiancÃ©e, Jennifer.
You gonna give me a grandchild?
Not for this kind of money.
Here you go, Mrs. Sianski.
Thanks for everything.
See you next weekend.
- Oh, sure.
- Okay, so we had a little help.
- Just with the hard stuff.
And the toilets.
- But we make a great team.
From now on, things are gonna go a lot smoother around here.
I'm sure they will.
Does that mean you won't need us anymore?
They're good.
Of course we still need you.
You girls come by and visit anytime.
Listen, I have to admit I was worried about how you boys were managing the girls.
Well, you may be a little sloppy, but those kids are getting a lot of love.
- Thanks, Mom.
- Honey.
This is nice.
I wish Bubba was here to share this.
Bubba!
I found him.
I love that amphibian.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
She's driving.
Well, she's dri-- She's driving, okay.
She's driving down, dri-- Drive-- She's driving.
Dri-- She's dri-- Maybe she's walking.
Jesse, you gotta see this.
Not now.
I'm working on this tune about this outrageous Italian goddess who drives a Lamborghini.
What rhymes with Lamborghini?
How about Cecil and Beany?
How about, "You're a weenie"?
Jesse, check out this serious toddling.
Tracking shot.
Tracking shot.
Come on, Michelle.
Danny, the kid's been walking for three days.
You haven't stopped.
I feel sorry for her when she starts potty training.
Know what this means?
My sweet little Michelle, she's now an object-grabbing heat-seeking instrument of destruction.
Hear this, humans.
I am Robo-Baby.
- Is Grandma here?
- Not yet.
- Look how cute you two look.
- Cute.
Just what we need.
More cute.
Grandma better get here soon.
We're very busy with honeybee business.
Joey, keep taping.
Girls, on the steps.
I wanna ask you something.
D.J., so how does it feel to finally be retiring as queen bee?
Great.
I'm way too old for this outfit.
It's time to pass my antenna onto the bees of the future.
I be so happy.
Girls, do the secret honeybee hello.
Okay, but I cannot allow this on tape.
That's Grandma.
We gotta buzz off.
Okay, come here, Michelle.
Here's the baby's bag.
Oh, yeah, here's the baby.
- There you go.
- Bye.
Bye.
See you later, boys.
Guys there's no children in the house.
You hear what I hear?
- I don't hear anything.
- Exactly.
It's silence.
Wha--?
I can't believe this.
I have no parental responsibilities.
This is great.
No, that's not true.
I really miss my kids.
- No, that's not true.
This is great.
- All right.
Let's party, boys.
- I got an idea.
Let's get some girls.
- Great.
There's a Three Stooges festival downtown.
You can meet some really fun girls there and the great part is, they don't mind if you poke them in the eye.
- I don't know.
- I got a better idea.
I get on my Harley, you follow in the Country Squire.
Not too close.
Cruise up to Tahoe.
Harrahs is having a Marilyn Monroe look-alike night.
- How do you know about this?
- How do you not know about this?
Guys, we've never had a boys' night out, just the three of us.
Let's go out together and just do some male bonding.
Male bonding?
Joey, you wanna bond?
All I want is a woman who, at just the right moment, goes: Guys, time-out.
I can't do this.
It's only been five months since I lost Pam.
Hey, don't let me stand in your way.
I'll be fine.
I'll just stay home alone.
Maybe change the part in my hair.
You guys go out.
Have a great time.
- Never mind.
- Never mind.
Okay, we're available for bonding.
- I'll do whatever you want.
I promise.
- Great.
You're not gonna think about women when you see what I've got in store.
Let's go fishing.
Neptune's Bride sails at midnight.
Great.
I've been dying for a place to wear this outfit.
All right.
Let's get this wonderful, fun-filled magical night of bonding over with.
Jesse, we're going fishing.
You look ridiculous.
I look ridiculous?
Gilligan's living room.
No, wait.
Don't hang up.
Sorry.
I'm not supposed to answer the phone.
Yes, Jesse's here.
Who may I say is calling?
- Give me the phone.
- No!
Get out of town!
The Roxanna?
The rock star, Roxanna?
- Come on.
- Jesse, how do you know Roxanna?
All right.
We had this hot and heavy thing for a while.
Actually, it was kind of serious.
We dated.
She became a big star, went on the road so we drifted apart.
Give me the phone.
Is this true?
Your story checks out.
So, Roxanna how's your new album?
Joseph, you leave me no choice.
- Say goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Hello.
Oh, sorry.
That was Joey.
He was raised by a family of really stupid wolves.
How are you doing?
I'm doing great, yeah.
My music?
My music's going really well.
- Yeah.
- That's great.
You told me you couldn't even find a job.
Beat it, wolf boy.
You know it'd be really nice to see you again.
Tonight?
Yeah, tonight would be good.
Jesse, you promised.
But actually, I can't tonight.
I'm going fish-- I'm going boating.
I'm going yachting actually.
I'm going yachting on a boat.
Yeah.
We're having a big party.
Neptune's Bride.
Yeah.
Champagne, caviar, what have you.
All right.
Good.
I'll call you in the morning.
Bye.
- Thanks.
You're not gonna regret this.
- Why be with a beautiful rock star when I can spend the evening with Thurston Howell Ill and Mr. Paul, the human fish stick.
Ahoy, mateys.
There she be.
Neptune's Bride.
The finest lady to sail the seven seas.
I say we mount her.
That's board her, squid head.
Isn't this great?
A night of men doing manly things.
There isn't a manlier man among men than the old salty dog who pilots this vessel.
Old Captain Jack, where you be?
He be retired.
I'm his granddaughter, Caroline.
I'll be your captain this evening.
Oh, yeah.
Men don't come any manlier.
Okay, so except for old Captain Caroline, it's boys' night out.
Manly men doing masculine things.
Jesse.
Roxanna.
Have mercy.
Come here.
What are you doing here?
I tracked you down.
I'm going on tour tomorrow and I just had to see you.
These are my backup singers.
- I'm Yvonne.
- I'm Vega.
I'm happy.
Jesse, this isn't a yacht.
Oh, yeah.
You're telling me.
Last time I ever rent a yacht from a guy named Ice Pick.
So, what?
There's not a party?
We're here to fish.
There's no party.
- There is now.
- Yeah!
- Come on.
- Let's do it.
All right, that's Joey.
This is Danny.
Which one's Yvonne?
Which one's Vega?
Thanks for helping me with the anchor, Danny.
Caroline, I live for this stuff.
Well, take a look at me.
Did I forget anything?
You could be the centerfold for Field & Stream.
Excuse me, girls.
Boys, it's time for fishing.
Oh, boy, am I a happy camper.
- Okay, Jesse.
What do you want?
- I don't care.
You want the Daiwa lightweight graphite Superflex or the Shimano Triton SpeedMaster?
- I really don't care.
- How could you not care?
The Daiwa has a 40-pound test and the Shimano has 50.
I don't care.
Give me the Daiwa.
The Daiwa.
In these waters, bad choice.
I don't care.
Give me a worm and some dental floss.
- I'll take the Shimano.
- The hell you will.
No way I'm getting stuck in these waters with a Daiwa.
Look at this, I got the Shimano.
The Shimano?
In waters like this?
Look at that.
Full moon.
There was a full moon the last night we were together.
You remember Big Sur?
I remember we rented that cabin and went crazy in every room.
Yeah, then we went down to the beach and we got even crazier.
Remember the seals were clapping for us.
That's ancient history, right?
Yeah, it's all in the past.
Just a shooting star that burned itself out.
Nothing but memories.
Yep, the magic's gone.
You guys just butchered a classic.
Yoo-hoo, champagne's gone.
Now what?
Well, ladies, how about a mÃ©nage Ã  fish.
We'd need a lot more champagne.
You gotta admit, it is kind of sexy out here.
All the rolling and swaying, swaying and rolling.
Up and down, down and up.
Excuse us.
Yep.
I know how to push all the right buttons.
- Well, we're in a great spot here.
- Oh, yeah.
I'm psyched.
I got my lucky pole, my lucky hat my lucky underwear with little sharks on it.
- But I digress.
- You're kind of funny.
- No.
- Yeah.
- No.
- Yeah.
Okay, yeah.
All right, Joey.
It's time for a fishing lesson from the master.
All right, Danny.
Show me how it's done.
The art of casting.
Click back your winder, thumb on the line cast forward with a firm flowing motion release your thumb and let her go.
Got it.
Click back your winder, thumb on the line cast forward with a firm flowing motion release your thumb and let her go.
- He got another one.
- He got-- That makes four.
I can't believe I haven't caught a thing.
- This makes five for us.
- All right.
It's a beauty.
How can this be?
Look what they're wearing.
Oh, great.
My bait is yawning.
Wake up.
Would you wake up, please?
Danny, is something wrong?
Where's the scuba gear?
There's something sinister going on down there.
You think the fish got together and made a group decision to avoid your hook?
It's the only logical explanation.
This is so boring reeling in fish after fish after fish.
Will you shut up?
You know, I wish we could see each other more often.
I know.
The only time I see you now is on MTV.
I owe a lot of my success to you.
Roxanna, you made it because you're good.
Remember the first song you sang in my band?
- Yeah.
How can I forget?
- Know what tune?
Do it.
That's it.
Fellas?
This is good.
Let's do some choreography.
Yeah!
That was almost fun.
I'm coming, beanie boy.
Hold on.
Anybody else want some more of my halibut - my albacore, my swordfish.
- Shut up.
You're just cranky because you got pulled overboard by a Michelin Radial.
Hey, that tire had an incredible will to live.
Hey, Roxanna, we'll meet you back at the hotel.
Thanks for breakfast, guys.
Oh, and thanks for the Pepto-Bismol.
I know my antacids.
You know, Joey, being with you actually bordered on fun.
Yeah.
I hear that a lot.
You know, Joey, we've met a lot of men.
And well, now we've met you.
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.
Seems like we're always saying goodbye, huh?
I hate it.
Jesse, come on the road with me.
Join your band?
Well, no.
We're an all-girl group and you're definitely not a girl.
Then why would I go on the road with you?
Just to be with me?
Do what?
Carry your bags for you?
- Tune your guitar?
That what you want?
- No.
Think I've got nothing better to do than follow you?
- You know, I really had a great time.
- So did I. How about if I make you dinner?
Dinner?
You know, food you eat when it gets dark?
No dinner.
How about lunch?
No.
No lunch, no food.
Liquid protein?
Look, Caroline I'm real sorry but I think this whole thing was just kind of a big mistake.
You really shouldn't be here right now because you really should be somewhere else.
Let me walk you to the door, okay?
- Jesse, you're overreacting.
- No, I'm not.
Come on, let's go.
- This is not gonna work out.
Go.
- Jesse.
- Get in your limousine.
- All right, everybody freeze.
I need to see Jesse and Danny in the kitchen right now.
- Joey, I'm in the middle of something.
- Humor me.
Girls, please don't leave.
Caroline, you like fish.
Roxanna, you like music.
Talk about Muddy Waters.
Joey, what is your problem?
You guys are crazy.
You had a nice time with Caroline, you with Roxanna.
What's the story here?
- Caroline and I are none of your business.
- Neither are Roxanna and I. Jesse.
Your attitude wouldn't have anything to do with her success?
No.
I don't know.
All right, I do know.
I mean, I put her band together, me.
I put the band together, she's a big star.
I put my band together, we're playing dives.
I promised myself, by the time I was 24, I'm gonna have a record deal.
I'm 24 and a half.
When's it gonna be my turn?
Hey, I know how that feels.
It's like when I see ALF, I go nuts.
I'm doing my standup in little nightclubs and a carpet sample has a series.
But, you know, if we hang in there we're gonna make it.
Danny, why are you so upset with Caroline?
Because she wanted to make me dinner.
The real problem is you like her.
Okay, I do like her.
And it scares me.
Ever since Pam everything is just so hard, so confusing.
I know how tough this has been on you.
That's how life is.
It's a struggle.
What helps you get through the tough times are the people by your side.
So when people like Roxanna and Caroline come along why push them away because you're frustrated with your career and because you're not ready to date yet?
You're throwing away what could be great friendships.
Is this the same guy who spends hours perfecting underarm noises?
Where is this coming from?
From my heart.
I did have some help with the words.
It's what Scooby-Doo told Scrappy-Doo last Saturday morning.
Thanks, Joey.
Come here, you big goof.
All right.
We got in some male bonding after all.
Will you guys excuse me for a moment?
Caroline, could I talk to you, please?
- Hi.
- Hi.
Look, I'm real sorry I flipped out.
It's just that.
Well, you know about my wife.
And I'm just not ready for this yet.
I really do like you.
Do you think maybe you and I could, like, just be friends?
I think that would be great.
Roxanna, I guess what I'm trying to say is maybe I was acting a little bit-- What's the word I'm looking for?
Insanely jealous.
Jesse, your time's gonna come.
You're too good.
You know I can't go with you.
I know.
I just want us to be together.
Well, maybe someday we will be.
But in the meantime you gotta realize a guy like me I gotta be freewheeling.
I gotta be riding on the wind.
I gotta be living on the edge.
Hi, Uncle Jesse.
- Will you help me off with my stinger?
- Sure, kid.
Well I'm living on the edge of cuteness.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Now, Michelle, stay right here.
Where you gonna go?
You're in a baby jail.
I'm ready for Stephanie's recital.
You think the shirt and tie go?
Well, I think the shirt and the tie should go.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
Stephanie, you've been rehearsing for three days straight.
You're this close to ballerina burnout.
Stephanie.
Stephanie.
- Stephanie.
- Stephanie.
I am not Stephanie.
I'm a swan who's about to kick the bucket.
Oh, God.
There's a dead swan in the living room.
Joey.
I'm alive.
I was just acting.
No.
Get out of town.
Unbelievable!
That's Daddy.
I don't want him to see me in my tutu until showtime.
Yikes!
Sorry I'm late.
I was editing my feature on great moments in bowling and I got held up when I couldn't find a second moment.
Oh, Dad, after Stephanie's recital, we hit the big sale at the Fashion Mart.
Everything is half off.
Of course, that doesn't save me any money because you'll just buy twice as much stuff.
I like your attitude.
It's Saturday afternoon, I'm all dressed up and where am I going?
A munchkin ballet.
Uncle Jesse, hot outfit.
Help Joey.
Very sharp, Joseph.
Where you going after the ballet?
Don Ho's wedding?
Jesse, it's for you.
How do you know she's not here to see me?
- Jesse!
- Adrianna, have mercy.
How are you?
If she's here to see you, she's very nice to your friends.
Let me introduce my roommates.
This is Danny Tanner and this is King Kamehameha.
You guys will never guess where I met this girl.
- A PTA meeting?
- Close.
Skydiving.
He missed the target and dropped right into my Alfa Romeo.
"Dropped right into my Alfa"-- I love that.
Anyway, she asked me to come back to her place and it turned out her place was in Rome.
- Come on.
I'll make some Spaghetti-Os.
- All right.
The guy is amazing.
He takes off, just like that, goes to Rome.
No toothbrush.
No clean underwear.
What a life.
Now, that is my fantasy.
You fantasize about having bad breath and dirty underwear?
Michelle.
Hi, Michelle.
Oh, hi!
Say "Dada".
Say "Dada".
Say "Da".
Say: She's so close, I can feel it.
Say "Dada".
Come on.
Dada, okay?
Now get off my back.
Hello.
Really?
The station wants me to cover the game of the week?
That's great.
No, that's not great.
Look, my little girl is having her first ballet recital.
Any chance Stanford and UCLA could delay the kickoff?
You know, like, three, four hours?
Hey, I took a shot.
All right.
Yeah, I'll be there.
You're gonna miss my recital?
I'm really sorry, honey.
I feel terrible.
It's okay, Dad.
Me and Steph understand you have to work.
But it's great having your dad on TV.
Right, Steph?
Yeah.
That part's fun.
I guess we're gonna miss the big sale too.
That's okay.
We can go some other time.
And pay full price.
Can I help you?
I need to talk to you.
Go ahead.
Talk.
So here's what I'm thinking: I think I need to make some changes in my life.
Bran.
Eat more bran.
What I mean by change is more danger, more excitement more Adrianna.
I'll be right back.
And I'll be right here.
Come here.
Come here.
- What do you want?
- I want your life.
- Were you always like this?
- No, I wasn't always like this.
I was like you.
Then I turned 4.
I remember, man, my dad got me my first bike.
Sailed into the driveway, ripped off the training wheels packed a bag, and took off to adventure.
If my dad hadn't snagged me, I'd have made it all the way to the Dairy Queen.
See, I love that story.
That's what I want: a life without training wheels.
You know something, kid?
I like you.
I could give you that life.
But understand, when you talk about a life like mine you're talking about living on the edge, man.
You're talking about taking risks.
You're talking about buying a new wardrobe.
Are you, Joseph Gladstone, ready to make that kind of commitment?
I am ready to be committed.
All right.
And now I get one.
Jesse!
Jesse!
What could you possibly want?
How was Stephanie's recital?
She came out, she danced, she died.
Oh, God, I wish I could have been there.
I rushed home, there's time to take the girls shopping.
I already took care of it.
Had to take Joey shopping so I took the girls to the sale, saved you a few bucks.
That was nice of you.
Hey, girls!
Come on downstairs and model your new clothes for your dad.
- Go!
- Jesse.
Why don't I just wait for you back at the hotel and I'll try on this cute little outfit you bought me.
Bye.
Have mercy.
Oh, you're gonna love this.
And now the lovely Donna Jo.
Donna Jo is sporting that lovely fall look.
She's got a tomato-red hat for that tomato-head look.
And, hey, look at them shoulders, huh?
Too much, baby.
Thank you, Donna Jo.
And now Stephanie.
The young Stephanie, just back from Milan steps out in style in her multicolored print.
She's a nice kid, but she's got a back problem.
Thank you, Stephanie.
Thank you, Stephanie.
Thank you, Stephanie.
Thanks, Steph!
And now for the latest in the always exciting world of toddler fashion the lovely, scintillating Michelle.
Michelle is sporting that look that says: "Hey, babe, it's the late '80s and I'm loving every minute of it".
Grab her.
Come here, you little weasel.
Looks like I missed out on a really special day.
My little girls, they're growing up so fast.
And now, taking a major fashion risk is the ultimate macho, macho man, Big Joe Stud!
Joey!
Shut up, punk.
Joey, you know, you actually make Michael Jackson look tough.
Michelle, you're gonna be such a fox when you get older.
Dada.
Jesse, my little girl just called you "Dada".
No, she didn't call me "Dada".
She called me.
She called me "dodo".
Well, here.
Here's your dad.
There.
Lay a "dad" on him.
Come on.
Hi, remember me?
Remember?
I'm your biological dada.
Come on, you little Muppet.
The guy's really asking for a "dada".
Can't you give him a "dada"?
Come on.
I'm your Uncle Jesse.
Dada.
I'm not your dad.
Here.
Give me the babe.
Dada.
Here.
Hi.
It's me, Dada.
Dada, Dada, Dada.
My sweet little baby, my own flesh and blood thinks that you two are her father.
Oh, my God!
My little baby doesn't have the foggiest idea who I am.
How many of us really know who we are?
This is all my fault.
I'm working too many hours.
I've gotta spend more time with my children.
Uncle Jesse bought us these to go clubbing.
Can we keep them, Dad?
Dad.
She called me "Dad".
Girls, I am taking all three of you out for father-daughter day.
All right, Daddy!
She called me "Daddy" too.
Pretty darn exciting, huh?
You wanna jump that fountain again?
That's all right.
Joseph, we're off the bike.
So I should let go of you now?
Either that or we have a lot of explaining to do to my parents.
Get off me.
- How did you like that ride?
- Jesse, it was a revelation.
I saw God!
In fact, I think we lapped him.
You got the look, you got the feel.
All you gotta do is get on a bike and ride to adventure.
Yeah, baby!
I'm hell-bound!
Whoa!
You ain't hell-bound on my bike.
Nobody rides my bike but me.
You need a bike?
Take your pick.
And if you miss thatsound, put some cards in the spokes.
You know what you are?
You're a bike tease.
You get a guy all fired up, and then you say "No".
Well, I want danger.
I want adventure.
I want to ride your pig.
That's "hog".
All right, Joey.
Once around the block.
Go ahead.
Now, listen, you be very careful.
You hear me?
I can't watch this.
Whoa, whoa, hold it!
What's your problem, dude?
You gotta open the garage door, dude.
Radical.
Daddy, why are you making feet movies?
Because I love you, and I love your little feet.
What's going on?
Daddy loves me and he loves my little feet.
I want to preserve every minute of your lives.
I'm gonna go brush my teeth.
Do you wanna reload?
Wait a minute, D.J. Girls, I have a surprise for you.
I am not going to work today.
Today is father-daughter day, part two.
- Yay!
- Yay!
Wait a minute, Dad.
How can you do this?
Sunday's your busiest day.
I worked it out.
I'm working New Year's Eve, but I worked it out.
This is your day.
We can do whatever you want.
- What do you wanna do?
- Can we take a cruise around the bay?
- It's your day.
- Then can we go horseback riding?
- It's your day.
- Then can we buy a big-screen TV a CD player, and couple of mopeds?
Why don't I just get you your own MasterCard?
It is my day.
Hello.
Joey!
You've been gone since yesterday.
Get your butt back here right now-- "Chill out, babe"?
Listen, you little leather-clad weasel.
I created you, I can destroy you-- Hello?
Hey-- I never taught him "chill out".
Safe.
Ho, ho, ho.
It's your last Christmas.
Tell Santa what kind of tombstone you want.
- Jesse-- - I said once around the block.
Once around the block.
Where were you?
- Jesse, I can explain everything.
- Once.
You know what once means?
Hi, girls.
Yeah, like that old trick's supposed to work.
- Hi, Uncle Jesse.
- Hi, Joey.
Hey, girls, how are you?
I was just welcoming home Joseph.
Girls, let's give the boys a moment to get reacquainted.
All right, speak, geek.
You better have one hell of a story.
Jesse, as soon as I left the driveway your spirit entered my body.
I knew that it was your spirit because my hair expanded.
All right, all right.
Quit sucking up and tell the story.
Then she appeared.
in red leather.
And what did my spirit tell you to do?
I threw the babe on the back of the bike, popped a wheelie and said, "Have mercy".
Now, that's my spirit.
That's my spirit, see?
Then we cruised into Vegas checked into Caesars, hit the crap tables.
Hour and a half later, I'm up $14,000.
Fourteen thousand dollars?
That's a lot of money.
And you have a pretty girl.
Did you?
You know?
Yep.
Got married.
Then it got interesting.
We hopped on a jet for the Big Apple, helicoptered into Manhattan where we quickly produced a revival of the Broadway smash Porgy and Bess.
You don't believe a word of this, do you?
Not a syllable.
- Well, let's give the truth a whirl.
- Okay.
I met a girl who lives just down the street.
She wasn't dressed in red leather.
She had a nice wallet.
So we went to her place where I did win $14,000 in Monopoly money.
Then I fell asleep on her couch.
You believe that, don't you?
I have to.
You put a mile and a half on the bike.
Jesse, I'm sorry I was gone so long.
Hope I didn't let you down.
You didn't let me down.
Maybe you didn't have a wild and crazy adventure but you had a cute little adventurette.
And you know what I found out?
No matter what I wear or what I'm riding on, I'm still gonna be Joey.
And you know something?
That's okay.
Damn right it's okay.
All right, Big Joe Stud.
Yeah, I guess I am pretty studly.
Okay, out of my way, dude.
Going upstairs to take a bubble bath.
Daddy, I love father-daughter day.
Me too, sweetheart.
Tomorrow, it's back to the real world.
I go to work, and you girls go to school.
Oh, fudge.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Great day, huh, Deej?
Yeah.
Major fun.
It was one of the best days of my life.
You don't sound all that happy.
I'm happy, honest.
See?
These are happy teeth.
I've known that face since it was the size of a tennis ball.
That is not a D.J. happy face.
Dad, for the last time, I'm happy.
Happy, happy.
Okay?
Okay.
Steph?
Honey, I'll bet you wanna get yourself a glass of water.
I'm not dumb.
You want me to leave.
Something's wrong.
Sweetie, I promise if something's wrong, we'll make it all better.
All right.
But if you need me, I'll be in the bathroom, drinking water and waiting.
D.J what's going on here?
You don't have to put on a happy act for me.
It wasn't for you.
It was for Stephanie.
Well, Stephanie's not here, honey.
What's going on?
It's just hard being brave for my little sister all the time.
Like, when you couldn't take me shopping, I felt terrible but I couldn't show it because if I did Stephanie would cry about you missing her recital.
D.J., you are a terrific big sister but no one has to put on an act in this house.
Now, what's bothering you?
I don't know.
Today was so much fun.
You took us horseback riding, to the circus, to Marine World but I kept getting sadder and sadder.
What part depressed you the most, the circus clowns or Shamu?
Honey, maybe you were sad for the same reason I was.
You were sad too?
A little bit.
Because the more fun we had, the more I hated to see it end.
I wish we could have days like this all the time.
I really love being with you.
I love being with you too but there is no easy answer here.
I know you have to work.
I wish I could be in two places at once, but I can't.
You know, I feel better.
You do?
Yeah.
We didn't solve anything but just talking about it helps.
It helps me too.
And D.J., I promise I'm gonna find more time to spend with you girls.
And anytime you want to see me, you can always pull me out of school.
Especially if you want to see me during math class.
Now, that's a D.J. happy face.
Come here, you little tennis-ball head.
Hi, honey.
You may not remember today but it was one of the best days of my life.
I love you, Michelle.
Good night, sweetheart.
Dada.
Yeah!
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Wish Daddy luck, honey.
It's a big night.
Daddy's getting a tryout as color man for the big fight.
Cable TV.
Nationwide.
Yes, I see how impressed you are.
There you go.
Da-da.
Michelle, I'd love to give you a hug, but And I'd just as soon them not see your cookies on my shoulder.
Do you promise everything inside of you is gonna stay inside of you?
Okay.
That's a preview, isn't it?
Okay.
Baby-dribble guard.
Come here.
Cool.
Yes.
All right.
All right.
- May I help you?
- Well, Jesse, what do you think?
You're planning on burping one of the boxers?
A good sportscaster is ready for anything.
Listen, I picked up the perfect tune for the lyrics here.
This is really cool.
Listen to this song.
You realize there are only seven notes.
Beethoven was right when he said, "It don't come easy".
Beethoven said, "It don't come easy"?
Well, he said it in German.
All right, Danny, I'm ready.
I want you.
I want you.
Second round, you going down.
Sorry, I'll-- I'll behave.
You are such a baby.
Longhaired hippie punk.
Danny, I gotta tell you, I am so proud of you.
Ever since you were sports editor of our high school newspaper - you had that dream.
- The one about Sharon Campbell?
No, not that dream.
Every guy in high school had that dream.
No, I mean your dream about making it as a sportscaster.
Tonight you go from local news to coast-to-coast.
Knock them dead.
Thanks.
And your dream about being a comic I promise you one day, I won't be the only one who thinks you're funny.
- Wait, Dad, hold on.
Don't go yet.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
We got some stuff for you for good luck.
Guess what this is.
A tie.
- Steph, you knew.
- Oh, yeah.
Daddy, now you guess.
- I give up.
- It's a tie, remember?
Oh!
A tie!
I'm so surprised.
This is beautiful.
I'm gonna wear this tonight.
- I got you a surprise too, Daddy.
- Oh, I love surprises.
Oh, this is great.
Thank you for the.
This is great.
That's the most beautiful one of those I've ever seen.
Try it on, Daddy.
Of course I'm gonna try it on.
Isn't that a cool tie tack, Dad?
God bless you.
- Steph, I love this.
Thank you, girls.
- You're welcome.
All right, I finally got it.
This baby is hit-bound.
Listen to this.
Everybody, sing along.
Coming right up, girls.
Get some snacks.
Hurry up.
Dad's almost on.
We're gonna watch him in our room.
All right.
- Don't forget the ice cream.
- Okay.
Right.
Got it.
- And the bowls and spoons!
- Bowls and spoons.
How can you eat ice cream without bowls and spoons?
All right.
- And licorice!
- Licorice.
All right.
Licorice.
Red licorice!
Got it.
And fruit!
Fruit.
Okay.
Get some fruit.
And milk!
Some milk.
Got it.
Don't forget to shut the door!
Shut the door.
The licorice and milk.
And we need peanut butter, and jelly, and bread, and carrots!
All right, girls.
This should get us through the first two rounds.
Uncle Jesse, we changed our minds.
We're watching the fight downstairs.
Freeze, ankle-biters.
This is as far as your Uncle Lunch Wagon goes.
It's Uncle Bad Attitude.
I guess this is a bad time to mention you forgot the carrots.
Yes, bad time.
Help me out here.
Come on.
Grab that.
Hey, Jess, quick, I need you in the nursery.
- Here.
Okay.
- Let me give you a hand with this.
What is happening to my life?
Michelle, please don't be sick.
All right, Joseph, what's the problem here?
I heard Michelle cough.
Here.
Kid, you okay?
She's cool.
It's time.
Daddy's gonna be on right after the underarm commercial.
All right.
We're coming.
I don't like that cough.
We should bring her with us.
Joey, you gotta realize babies cough, man.
Babies dribble.
Babies barf.
Think of them as little tiny teenagers.
Come on, Michelle, come on.
Come on now.
You okay?
You okay?
You girls ever hear that cough before?
Sounds like a hairball.
Come on, Steph.
Babies don't get hair-- Do babies get hairballs?
And now, live from San Francisco, a special boxing presentation.
Here's Danny Tanner.
Good evening, boxing fans.
I'm Danny Tanner-- - Back up, back up.
- I'm Danny Tanner.
I'm Danny Tanner-- Now I'm really Danny Tanner, and welcome to tonight's fight.
We're in the training room of former champion, Reggie "The Sandman" Martin.
Only moments away from his first attempt on the comeback trail to reclaim his heavyweight crown.
And here he is now.
- Well, champ, how you feeling?
- I feel good.
I feel strong.
I feel like hitting somebody.
- But not me, right?
- That depends on the question.
Okay, no pressure here.
Well, champ, the obvious question: Why the comeback?
You got plenty of money in the bank.
Heck, you own a bank.
You've been retired for two years.
You miss wearing the shorts?
- No, no.
You see, it's-- - Pride.
It's pride, respect.
The champ wants to go down as the greatest fighter in the history of boxing.
- Are you sure it's not the $6 million?
- Okay, I miss wearing the shorts.
My tie tack!
I know why I'm wearing a cup.
But, now, why are you wearing a saucer?
Oh, this.
This is a gift from my daughter, Stephanie.
And the tie is a gift from my daughter, D. J. And I have a little baby, Michelle, too.
But you can't wear her gifts.
You probably haven't seen your family much during training.
- Yeah, Lou runs a pretty tough camp.
- The toughest.
Total isolation.
Just me, the Sandman, and misery.
No phone calls, no women, no nothing.
Look, I'm sorry about that, Marcie.
How you feeling, honey?
I think it's wonderful you and your wife are still good friends, considering.
Yeah.
Considering what?
- You know-- - Yeah, right, champ.
Just loosen up.
Hey, the man said "considering".
Considering what?
- Considering what happened.
- Loosen up, champ.
If I don't get some information, I'll loosen somebody's head.
Now, you said, "It's great we're still friends".
Why wouldn't my wife and I still be friends?
So about tonight's fight.
Let's talk strategy.
- Hey, man.
- Let's forget about strategy.
Usually, when a woman moves out on a man, they stop being friends.
- She moved out?
- Champ, it's time to fight.
Let's go.
Fight?
I just found out my wife walked out on me.
Use it, champ!
Use the anger!
Champ, I'm sorry.
Oh, boy, am I sorry.
I can't believe you didn't know about this.
- You calling me a liar?
- Oh, not at all.
Why would I choose those as my last words?
I just figured, since the story was in the papers, the magazines and the soon-to-be TV movie-- She left me and sold the rights?
Oh, no, Marcie, baby.
No, no, no, baby, no.
It'll be okay, champ.
It'll be okay.
You're kind of taking the edge off him, huh, Tanner?
In a way, this is kind of a beautiful moment.
Thanks for sharing it with us.
And, Sandman, best of luck on tonight's fight.
Fight?
I can't fight.
- Come on, champ.
You'll fight.
- I can't fight now.
You'll knock him out.
- You're gonna win it.
- But I can't fight.
Why was that man crying?
Well, the man was crying because your dad made him so happy.
I don't think so.
We'll be back after this word from anybody but me.
Now what happens?
Well, two guys beat each other up for about 36 minutes.
- Then they get $6 million.
- Six million dollars?
Forget about being a ballerina.
Maybe you girls shouldn't be watching all this violence.
Joey's right, Steph.
Let's go watch reruns of The A-Team.
Hear that?
She coughed again.
This cough is getting serious.
I'll think of something.
- What are you doing?
- Calling the baby's doctor.
Good.
I knew I'd think of something.
Here.
Hello, Dr. Landress?
You're home?
You answer your own phone?
Are you any good?
Yeah, I'm calling about Michelle Tanner.
She's coughing.
Hold on, doc.
He wants to know what kind of cough.
It's a little baby's cough, you know.
Like that.
Doc, I do impressions for a living.
It was more like: Give me the phone.
I'm sorry.
We're new parents.
Come here.
Listen to Michelle cough.
There you go.
Cough, Michelle.
Come on, cough.
Come on.
It's like when you take your car to the mechanic.
It never makes that same noise.
All right.
Her nose?
Yeah, it's running like a fountain.
What's coming out of it?
Diet cola.
Fever?
I don't know.
Of course I know how to take her temperature.
You simply put the thermometer under her ton-- I put it where?
Joey, it's for you.
Twist Harold up.
Twist Harold down to the right.
Normal.
No temperature.
High five, Michelle.
High five, high five, high five.
- All right.
- Okay.
Doctor said no fever means it's a cold and we should use the medicine from her last cold.
Okay, we got strawberry mousse apricot conditioner, honey nut rinse-- You believe these girls put all this dumb junk in their hair?
It's mine.
What are you looking at?
All right.
Here it is.
"Michelle Tanner.
Half a teaspoon four times a day".
- All right.
Give me that.
- Remember that.
Okay.
The fight's over.
They said Dad will be back on after these important messages.
Okay.
- What are you doing to Michelle?
- We're giving your sister some medicine.
- That's not the way Daddy does it.
- Stephanie.
All right, here you go, Michelle.
Joey, duck!
Well, so much for cough syrup and purÃ©ed chicken.
I told you it wouldn't work.
You never serve red cough syrup with poultry.
By the way, if I'm ever sick, dial 911.
- Daddy's on!
- Okay.
Come on.
Well, fans, you saw it: Reggie "The Sandman" Martin was KO'd.
He may have been a little off tonight.
That happens.
I don't think the blame should be laid at anybody's feet.
I mean anybody.
Am I being clear?
A blameless defeat.
Hey, Tanner.
How does it feel to have personally dealt a crushing blow to a man's career?
Are you talking about the Sandman's or my own?
Do you have some sort of personal grudge against the Sandman?
No, the Sandman and I have always had a very warm and cordial relationship.
I want him!
I want him!
I want Danny Tanner!
I want him!
I want him!
Can't you just feel the love?
Walk with me as I apologize to the Sandman.
Sandman, I am really very, very sorry.
It's okay.
It's not your fault.
At least somebody had the guts to tell me about my wife.
Say, you wouldn't happen to know why she left me, would you?
Maybe not seeing your wife for three or four months resulted in a teensy loss of intimacy.
It's okay, champ.
We don't need her.
It's this "we" stuff.
It's this "we" stuff that got me in trouble.
You talked me out of retirement because you needed money.
Now, you knew about my wife all the time, didn't you?
I kind of got an inkling when I saw the cover story of Sports Illustrated.
Look, Marcie.
Marcie, honey, I'm gonna give up boxing for good.
I'm gonna find you, beg for forgiveness and win you back, because I love you, baby.
Lou, you fired.
Tanner, this whole thing is your fault.
Thanks, Stephanie.
You're welcome, Daddy.
Didn't Daddy do great?
- Oh, he was quite good this evening.
- He was so good.
He really was.
Yeah, girls, nobody can take a punch like your father.
- Can we stay up till Daddy gets home?
- No.
Go to sleep.
Come on.
Get some rest.
Tomorrow we may have to move to a civilization without television.
Go.
- Good night!
- Good night.
All right Joey, you try to give her her medicine.
I give up.
Okay, Michelle.
Here it comes.
Come on.
It tastes really good.
Watch this.
Smile.
The baby's watching you.
And she's waiting for her Uncle Jesse to swallow.
This stuff's terrible.
- But you're not coughing, are you?
- All right, enough of this nonsense.
That's it, Michelle.
Enough fooling around.
This is the last teaspoon of medicine.
You're drinking it.
You're gonna feel better.
And you're gonna do it right now.
Come on.
Come on.
Right now.
Come on.
See?
Told you.
All we had to do was ask nice.
Yes.
- Danny.
- Joey, please.
Don't bother lying to me.
I stunk.
I just want you know that Michelle is gonna be fine.
- What?
- Well, she was sick, but she's fine now.
Why didn't you say something?
Sing along, Michelle.
Michelle, Michelle.
Daddy's here.
Hi.
- Jesse, what's wrong with her?
- Nothing.
She just had a little cold.
- How do you know it's a little cold?
- She had a cough, runny nose but no fever.
She should have fluids.
- Done.
- Done.
We should call the doctor.
- Done.
- Done.
Really?
Has she had her cough medicine?
- Done.
- Done.
How about changing her diaper?
- Good night.
- Good night.
Well, the baby's asleep.
Her cold sounds much better.
You guys were really great tonight.
Yep, I finally learned how to take care of the little kid.
- I'll drink to that.
- All right.
- I can't thank you guys enough.
- No problem.
I really love that little germ-spreading, phlegm faucet.
You know, when I came home tonight, I was so down.
But then I heard Michelle was sick.
And it put everything back into perspective.
I realized what's really important is my family and my friends.
So you forgot all about the nightmare of an interview.
Right up until this very moment when you were kind enough to just bring it up again.
I was horrible.
Come on.
"Horrible's" a pretty harsh word.
You were-- - Well, you were horrible.
- Yeah, yeah.
He was horrible.
Isn't this where you're supposed to jump in with a little pep talk?
I don't know if I got one in me, Danny.
You?
What?
A sick baby and a pep talk?
What am I, a saint?
Come on, I'll get you started.
How about: Every cloud has a silver lining, or the sun will come out tomorrow.
I'm feeling it.
Pep is welling up.
It's in my stomach.
It's working its way north.
It's in my throat, and pep!
Danny, nobody's career goes straight up.
You had one rough night.
There's always bumps along the way.
This is good.
Don't stop.
Then don't interrupt.
The key, Danny is to learn from all those little bumps so that you'll be better prepared for next time.
Because you will have other chances.
When?
I need a date and a time.
Soon.
Because you're good at what you do.
And you know why?
Because you care about more than just scores and stats.
You care about people.
- Right, Jess?
- Yeah, why not?
And in your own unique way, you helped the Sandman.
People trust you.
They know you're a good guy.
Right, Jess?
Yeah, why not?
Thanks, guys.
My favorite part was when the manager punched him-- Right in the stomach.
I loved it when he brought tears to the Sandman's eyes.
That was nice.
But the reporters drilling him-- He had sweat going down his face.
That killed me.
That was funny.
That was good.
You know what I loved?
When I said there was no one to blame.
I loved how bad that was.
"I want you, Tanner!
I want you, Tanner!
Yes, I want you, Tanner"!
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Joey!
What's going on down here?
What's with all the screaming?
Danny, this psycho was about to mash my potato.
I was not.
I heard a noise and thought it was a prowler.
Liar.
Follow me.
I think it's over here.
Hello.
Don't ever say hello to your father like that again.
Do you guys play baseball every night after we go to sleep?
Actually, girls, Uncle Jesse's holding a bat because he's a wee bit miffed at me.
A wee bit miffed?
I'm miffed off.
- When I think about what you did to me-- - Come on.
Let's let bygones be bygones.
All right.
Bye.
You're gone.
I don't know what's going on here, but why don't you guys just stop this and give each other a hug.
A high-five?
I'm not in the mood.
You know why?
I'll tell you why.
It's all because of a little story titled: "Mean Mr. Joey Stabs Sweet, Innocent Uncle Jesse in the Back".
- Story time.
- Yeah.
You don't wanna hear "Mean Mr. Joey Stabs Sweet, Innocent Uncle Jesse - in the Back," do you?
- Yeah.
It's got a great title.
All right, one quick story, but don't think about staying up to watch Letterman.
This better be PG.
It all started last week.
The exterminator business was slow, so I decided to start teaching guitar.
I was waiting for my new student to show up.
She's a lady No-- She's not.
She's a woman She's a muchacha Maybe she's a man.
Uncle Jesse, there's a girl here to see you.
This one's great.
Oh, that must be my new guitar student.
Yeah, right.
Come on in!
Hi.
- I'm Corinna Spicer.
- I'm Jesse Cochran.
I'm out of here.
Corinna.
That's a real pretty name.
So welcome to the Jesse Cochran School of Music.
I'll take this for you.
Thanks.
Interesting dÃ©cor.
Don't meet a lot of men with little pink bunnies on their walls.
I'm also a Mouseketeer.
- I like that in a man.
- Good.
Because today is "Anything Can Happen" day.
Here.
Take a seat.
Why?
Because we like you.
I kill myself.
But, Jesse, I have to warn you.
I have absolutely no musical experience.
I teach second grade and I wanna accompany my kids on sing-alongs.
That's wonderful!
You get to work with children.
I love youngsters.
- Uncle Jesse-- - Not now.
Poor Mr. Teddy.
Tell you what.
Soon as we're done, I'll help you sew Mr. Teddy's head right back onto Mr. Teddy's body.
Okay, honey bunch sugar pie?
Honey bunch?
Sugar pie?
This is weird.
You're pretty.
Watch him.
My little niece.
I could just eat her up-- Okay.
Back to music.
All right.
Now.
I'm gonna teach you two simple chords and in no time, you're gonna be playing a song.
First chord.
It's an "A" chord.
Get it?
"A" chord!
You're real pretty when you smile like that.
Sorry.
Back to music.
Anyway, the next chord would be a "D" chord, which is this, this, and that.
Try that.
Perfect.
Good.
You now have more musical knowledge than Twisted Sister.
With those two chords, you can play 374 tunes.
Including such campfire favorites as: Everybody sing along!
There's that chord again.
Very nice.
Let's try the strum.
This one, that one, this one, that one.
- Good.
- After the lesson I invited Corinna out for a little ride on my motorcycle.
Seven hours later.
See, that's the power laugh.
That's good.
- You wanna stay and have a drink?
- I really can't.
I have other plans.
But thank you for a great day.
A guitar lesson, a picnic by the bay, candlelight dinner in the wine country.
- You do this for all your students?
- Well, that was the deluxe lesson.
That'll be $475.
- The check's in the mail.
- All right.
- See you next lesson.
Wednesday night?
- Okay.
Corinna.
I had a really nice time today.
Those are my nieces.
- Bye, Jesse.
- Bye, Corinna.
Have mercy.
Don't ever "eww" when your uncle's kissing.
Joey, this was actually cleaner when the food was cooking in it.
Jesse, we saved you some chili.
Not hungry.
Oh, brother, not again.
Okay what's her name?
Corinna.
Corinna?
Don't you ever meet a Debbie or a Susie?
Okay, fine.
You guys crack all the jokes you want but I'm telling you, when our eyes met, there was magic.
With you there's always magic.
You should wear a top hat and pull white doves out of your pants.
Fine.
That's fine.
In Jesse's defense, when it comes to love, I think anything is possible.
I felt the same instant magic when I met Pam.
She walked into my 10th grade geometry class, sat down right next to me and I said, "Hi.
Can I borrow your slide rule"?
You didn't reach puberty by the 10th grade?
Not till I met Pam.
But the next morning I woke up with a mustache.
I'm sorry.
No sale, boys.
Love just does not happen that fast.
Hey, guys, you know how I know it's real?
I can't stop smiling.
I'm just smiling away like I'm Nancy Reagan.
I just can't stop smiling.
I stopped, thanks to him.
- But Corinna and me were madly in love.
- We did see them kissing.
Jesse, please stop making out in front of my kids.
Mr. Backstabber why don't you tell everybody what you did today?
Well, I woke up, turned off the alarm did that stretching thing-- Not the stretching thing, the backstabbing.
And could you pick up the pace?
I'd like to get the girls to bed before Good Morning America.
Well, it was stormy and me, Danny, and the girls were getting ready to watch The Wizard of Oz.
Here we go, popcorn du jour.
All in honor of Stephanie's first viewing of The Wizard of Oz.
- I'm psyched.
- You should be.
It's the sweetest movie.
There's this pretty girl, Dorothy, and she's got this adorable dog, Toto who gets kidnapped by this horrible witch but she gets her dog back, her house flies through the air and then it lands on this other horrible witch whose feet curl up like party favors.
Trust me, honey, it's the sweetest little movie.
Hi.
I'm Joey.
Can I help you, please?
- I'm here to see Jesse.
- Aren't they all.
I'm Corinna Spicer.
I have a guitar lesson.
Jesse called to say he's running a bit late.
Would you like to watch The Wizard of Oz with us?
- That's my favorite movie.
Yeah.
- Oh, it's mine too.
Come on in.
Corinna, this is Danny, Stephanie, D.J., and Michelle.
Corinna.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Oh, Dad, something happened to the TV.
It's snowing in Kansas.
Cable goes out every time there's a storm.
Fix it.
- Steph, this is not something I can fix.
- Fix it.
I'm gonna call the cable company.
You'll get a busy signal.
Fix it.
Why wasn't I born a cable repairman?
No problem.
I do that Wizard of Oz bit in my act.
Somebody do something.
I'm very upset.
Okay, everybody gather round for The Wizard of Oz.
Grab a seat right in front.
Here we go.
Dorothy, Dorothy!
Auntie Em, Auntie Em!
A twister!
A twister!
A twister!
It sure is scary around these parts.
There's probably lions, and tigers, and bears.
Oh, my.
- Come on, you guys.
- Lions, and tigers, and bears.
Oh, my!
Lions, and tigers, and bears.
Oh, my!
Put them up.
Put them up.
I am the great and powerful Oz!
I'm melting!
Melting!
I feel like-- Butter.
You've always had the power to get back to Kansas.
Click your heels together three times and say: You've always had the power There's no place like home.
There's no place like home".
Dorothy, wake up.
Your teeth are finished.
Well, what did you think?
Fix it.
Oh, Joey, I loved it.
Yeah, that was an incredible simulation.
I hope you don't feel bad when I rent the tape tomorrow.
Okay, girls, come on.
It's time to get you into your pajamas and ready for bed.
This should only take five or six hours.
- Good night, Joey.
- Good night, Joey.
- Good night.
- Night.
- Good night.
- Oh, great kids.
Yeah.
They're the greatest kids in the history of kids.
I love how children are so open and natural.
- I think that's why I went into teaching.
- That's why I refuse to grow up.
Oh, you seem pretty grown up to me.
Who, me?
The guy who keeps Abe Lincoln on a stick in his bedroom?
Joey, you are so funny.
I think that a sense of humor is a very sexy quality in a man.
Your girlfriend must adore you.
Oh, I don't have a girlfriend.
You're not seeing anybody?
Well, sort of.
I'm seeing the dentist next Wednesday.
Well, if things don't work out between you and the dentist maybe you and I could get together.
Well, Dr. Hoffman's pretty cute, but he is married.
So pick a time.
How about right after my guitar lesson with Jesse?
Jesse.
Corinna!
Jesse, yeah!
Yeah.
Excuse me.
I'm gonna go check on something in the kitchen.
- Can I give you a hand?
- No.
I'm doing fine.
Okay.
- Okay.
- What exactly are you checking on?
Oh, I'm just doing some random checking.
Salt, pepper, duck, stove, sink, faucet.
Jesse's girl.
Well, everything checks out.
You know, he's really crazy about you.
Yeah, well, Jesse's really a terrific guy, and we had a really nice day together but to be honest, there was nothing really special between us.
Well, that's not how Jesse puts it.
And if there's one thing in life that's sacred - you never mess with a buddy's girl.
- But I'm not his girl.
All Jesse and I had between us was one little innocent kiss goodbye.
It was nothing, really.
It was one of these: Oh, that right there.
That was nothing.
It's how I kiss my grandmother.
You must be very close.
It was like four lips shaking hands.
Look-- We can try it again.
Oh, good.
You're home.
So where was I?
I came in and found you kissing the woman of my dreams.
Oh, yeah.
Good memory.
So there we were.
Jesse had walked in to find me kissing the woman of his dreams.
Oh, good.
You're home.
What the hell is going on here?
Well, Jesse, actually, it's very simple.
Corinna was choking on some bad cheese so I initiated a Heimlich maneuver.
And when that didn't work I tried to suck out the cheese using the Hoover maneuver.
So you weren't kissing.
You were searching for cheese.
- You look upset.
- Oh, why would I be upset?
You're saving the life of someone who's very special to me.
- Jesse-- - Corinna, please.
I'm not really in the mood to give a guitar lesson tonight.
Besides, you're probably still reeling from that near-death-by-cheese.
Why don't you go home and practice?
Jesse, wait a minute.
There's something I have to say.
Corinna really wasn't choking on any bad cheese.
No!
- We were kissing.
- No!
Corinna, Joey and I should probably have a word together alone.
Look, I'm really sorry if there's any misunderstanding.
- I didn't mean to cause trouble.
- There won't be any trouble.
Jesse and I are very close friends.
We'll have a heart-to-heart and work this thing out in a very calm, rational, adult manner.
Come here!
Come here, you!
Freeze!
I have a baby, and I know how to use it.
- Joey-- - I'm warning you, she's loaded.
- Put the baby down.
- Not a chance.
Okay.
Okay, fine.
I'll wait.
Gotta put the kid down sometime.
Two, three days, that diaper's gonna weigh 5 to 600 pounds.
Jesse, I'm really sorry.
I should have stopped everything cold before anything happened.
- I should have talked to you.
- Really?
Yeah, you were right.
I felt this instant magic, and I fell in love with her.
You fell in love with her?
You can't fall in love with her, man.
I fell in love with her first.
I'm sorry, but she likes me more.
How can she like you more than she likes me?
Boys stop this.
Michelle has enough love for all of us.
Don't make her choose.
Now, both of you, give her a kiss.
Go ahead.
Give her a kiss.
So now a second woman had come between us.
I wanted to talk things out, but Jesse said he couldn't stand to look at me.
Apparently, a Louisville Slugger puts him in the mood for conversation.
I told you, I heard a noise.
I wasn't gonna bat you.
All right, girls, it's time to go to sleep.
Your Uncle Jesse and Joey have told you a wonderful bedtime story.
I'm sure you'll have visions of jealous little sugarplums dancing in your heads.
But wait a minute.
How does the story end?
Well, Joey's guilt drives him totally insane, but no one knows the difference.
I don't think so.
Wake us up and tell us who gets the girl.
There's a whole different world that starts the second we go to sleep.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Guys, come here.
What do you want now?
Before you duel to the death, let's have one more conversation to work this out.
Not with this scum.
Okay, then just talk to me.
Let me ask you boys a question or two about your beloved Corinna.
What are the things she cares about most in the world?
What does she look for in a relationship with a man?
Let's try this one.
What color are her eyes?
- Hazel.
- Green.
Green-hazel.
They have white around the edge, I think.
Anybody know her last name?
- Spicer.
- Spicer.
Pat Sajak knows more about his contestants.
You know, I don't think you fell in love with Corinna.
That takes time.
I think maybe you fell in love with being in love.
Am I right, Jesse?
I do seem to fall in love a lot but it's just because I'm always hoping that this is the one.
I just wanna meet one nice, special girl I can spend my life with.
Aw, Jesse.
Everybody wants that.
But you don't have to try so hard.
When the right woman comes along, you really will know it.
I could have sworn Corinna was it.
Maybe I did go a little overboard.
I guess I was just shocked that she liked me as much as I liked her.
Why are you shocked?
Have a little faith in yourself.
You're a good guy.
As much as I hate to admit it it seems like Corinna likes you more than she likes me.
God, I hate to admit it.
All right, you're not scum.
I know that comes from your heart, Jess.
That was almost semi-touching.
You hear that noise?
I told you someone was out here.
- Hi.
- Corinna.
What are you doing here?
Come in.
I really felt terrible about tonight and I came back to apologize.
Then I heard shouting, so I decided to go home.
But then I felt even worse, so I decided to come back.
Look.
You both are great guys and I would hate to do anything to mess up your friendship.
I'm really sorry.
Okay, now I'm gonna go home again.
Goodbye.
Hold on a second.
I may have met you first, but I think we all know who belongs together here.
Why don't you take some time and get to know Joey.
He's a good guy.
He's got pajama problems, but.
I love this guy.
- Hug her, not me.
- Sorry.
You big dummy.
Come on, Jesse.
Let's leave these two alone.
By the way what were you really gonna do with the bat?
I was gonna kill him.
That's what I would have done.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Happy Thanksgiving, Michelle.
Today you have an opportunity that only comes around once in your career as a baby.
You can blow everyone away at Thanksgiving dinner by uttering one simple word: Turkey.
Turkey.
Turkey, turkey, turkey.
I'm sorry, you don't need this kind of pressure, do you?
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- Why is there a Butterball on my head?
Jesse, apparently your hair is some sort of baby magnet.
Man, it's 7:00, it's a holiday, good night.
Jesse, I am sorry, but I've got a little problem and I need to see you and Joey downstairs right now.
Come on.
I gotta get a lock for my door.
We're coming to some stairs, I recommend you opening your eyes.
Joey, come on.
Wake up, buddy.
Good morning, how you guys doing?
Boy, it's great to be alive.
Happy Thanksgiving, buddy.
Why can't you wake up grumpy and grouchy like normal people?
- Because it's a beautiful day.
- Yeah.
Boys, brace yourselves.
- It's snowing in Tacoma.
- No.
Boy, it's a good thing I didn't sleep through that news.
You don't understand, my mom lives in Tacoma and she's snowed in.
She was supposed to make our Thanksgiving dinner for us.
It's no problem, we'll make that seven-course meal ourselves.
How, you ask?
The miracle of Thanksgiving.
You are a moron.
There's a miracle of Christmas and there's Smokey Robinson and The Miracles, there's Miracle Whip.
But there's no miracle of Thanksgiving, huh.
Oh, no?
Suppose the Pilgrims had landed in Florida.
We'd all be eating flamingo.
All I know is, everything today has to be absolutely perfect.
Why?
Because it's the girls' first Thanksgiving without their mother.
That's right.
That's gotta be rough on them.
We gotta make this a fun day, a great day for them.
- And it will be, you know why?
- Why?
The miracle of Thanksgiving.
- Now let's get in there and cook.
- Right.
Right after that we'll hunt for eggs left by the Thanksgiving Bunny.
Okay, everything's on the table and ready for cooking.
- What should we make first?
- Reservations.
I know this looks a little intimidating but families all over this country are turning these ingredients into a Thanksgiving feast.
Maybe we should go have dinner with one of them.
Nobody panic, we've got cookbooks.
If you can read English, you can cook.
For instance: "Basic bread stuffing.
Melt one-third cup butter in a heavy skillet".
That's easy.
On the stove, right?
No, we stick the butter in a rocket ship and send it to the sun.
All right.
Guys, stay with me here.
"Add one-fourth cup finely minced onion".
We've got three different kinds of onion here.
Are there any pictures?
Well, here's one of Betty Crocker, but they cut her off above the onions.
Okay.
"Stir in four cups breadcrumbs.
See pages 35 to 37.
Two cups chicken stock.
See pages 46 to 48.
One pound pork sausage.
See pages 78 to 81".
Stuffing is highly overrated.
Hey, mister, what happened to the miracle with the horn thing, of Thanksgiving?
If we can get a restaurant reservation on Thanksgiving, there's your miracle.
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- Happy Thanksgiving.
Look out.
Here comes big, bad biker mama.
Michelle.
Michelle.
Pop a wheelie.
Pop a wheelie.
All right.
See, I taught her everything I know.
Girls, I have a little bad news.
It's snowing up north, and Grandma can't make it.
- Oh, no.
- But don't worry we're going to the best restaurant in town for a super-great Thanksgiving feast.
It's quiz time.
- How is Thanksgiving gonna be?
- Super great.
That's correct.
And now, D.J. to tie, how is Thanksgiving gonna be?
Time's up.
What do I win?
Steph, how could you say that sounds super great?
I think the idea stinks.
Can I change my vote?
D.J., what's wrong?
Mom always cooked us a home-cooked meal for Thanksgiving.
Don't you think we should have Thanksgiving here?
Yeah, we're just a little nervous about turning all this food into something that can still be eaten.
Last year, Mom taught me how to make a picture-perfect pumpkin pie.
- So I can make that.
- And I can help.
And I talked to Grandma last night on the phone and she was gonna put me in charge of the turkey anyway.
- So I can handle that too.
- If I help.
D.J., you're right.
Guys, we can do this.
I am gonna make that stuffing.
All right.
And you know what?
It just so happens I can do amazing things with a yam.
And in many parts of the world, I am known as Mr. Vegetable.
Give me my kid.
I'm feeling the miracle.
The miracle of Thanksgiving.
Can you feel it?
We feel it.
Yes.
Are you ready?
We're ready.
Now, let's cook.
Let's take a walk around the table.
Let's do that Temptation thing.
All right, girls, let's go.
Here we go.
We should have been the new Monkees.
Ladies and gentlemen, the miracle of Thanksgiving.
The little miracle-ette who made it all possible: D.J. Thank you.
I couldn't have done it without you guys.
Okay.
Guys, go carve the turkey.
Ladies, please be seated at our Thanksgiving table.
- Thank you.
- Michelle, what are they gonna carve?
Turkey.
Turkey, turkey, turkey.
This is so much better than a restaurant.
Yeah, I hate those booster seats.
They squeeze my tush.
- Jess, we got a problem here.
- Let me try.
It's frozen.
I had no idea you two were so good in the kitchen.
The turkey, the pie.
You should open a restaurant and support me the rest of my life.
It's frozen.
The thing's frozen.
I'm so glad this worked out so perfect.
I wasn't sure if I could pull it off but it turned out just the way Mom cooked it last year.
Do you think she would have been proud of me?
I'm sure she would have been, honey.
Excuse me a second.
I'll be right back.
You two stay right here.
Is there something wrong with my turkey?
- No.
- No, there's no turkey problem at all.
- This is a very happy bird.
- Yeah.
He's happier than heck to be dead right here in our kitchen.
I'm just gonna shove that sucker back in the oven for just a couple more minutes.
Are you sure there's nothing wrong with it?
Of course, honey.
You know what a nut I am about that extra-crispy skin.
Well, Dad, don't overcook it.
You don't want it to get dry.
There's no danger of that happening, D.J. Oh, my gosh.
Someone's at the door.
Who's gonna get it?
I don't know.
- Let's all go get it.
- Let's all go get it.
Let's go see who came to visit us on Thanksgiving Day.
Coming.
Yes, yes, yes.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Must be your friends, Jesse.
- No, not yet.
Come in.
Hi, I'm Paula.
And this is my sister Alexandra.
Hi, I'm Danny Tanner.
These are my kids, Michelle, D.J. and Stephanie.
That's Jesse and Joey.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Hi.
Who are you?
Isn't this 1882 Jerrard?
Jerrard Way, Avenue, Street, Place or Lane?
I'm not sure.
Uncle Henry just moved to town.
Could we use your phone?
We're already late, and this hot turkey's getting cold.
Hot turkey.
Sure, come on in.
There's the phone, right over there.
Great.
Girls, take Michelle and go upstairs and wash your hands.
Why?
They're clean.
Yeah, but they're not Thanksgiving clean.
Go, go, go.
Go.
Men, this is the miracle of Thanksgiving.
That turkey was meant for us.
I got a feeling that it may come as a surprise to the young ladies.
There's only one person who can convince these women to stay for dinner.
I don't know, it's gonna be rough.
It'd be easier if it was one girl with a chicken on Groundhog's Day.
Jesse, just think of little D.J.'s face when she goes into the kitchen and sees a turkey ice sculpture in the oven.
All right, I'll give it a shot.
But I'll need a few things.
You, you dim the lights.
Joey, go get some drinks.
I'll get us some traditional pumpkin margaritas.
- All right, I'll surprise you.
- Get out of.
Thank you.
I'm sorry if we interrupted your dinner.
Dinner?
What a coincidence.
I was just gonna talk about dinner.
Why spend dinner over Uncle Hank's house which, by the way, you can't even find when fate has dropped you and your bird, if you will, here in our laps?
Because our husbands wouldn't like it.
Ball's in your court.
I'll give you $100 for that turkey.
- Excuse me?
- $125.
- You wanna buy our turkey?
- You bet, $140.
- This is crazy.
- $150.
Let's talk.
Oh, no.
- Joey.
- Just a minute.
What planet have we landed on?
I'm not sure, but I think I hear Uncle Henry calling.
- Good luck.
- Wait, $175, you can keep the stuffing.
$200.
What is it, Lassie?
What is it, girl?
Did Grandpa fall in the river again?
What?
- Oh, my God.
- We can't even see.
All right, be careful.
It's on-- The thing's on fire.
Oh, my gosh.
I love that crispy skin.
What happened?
It's all my fault, honey.
Your turkey was a little frozen, so I shoved it in the oven and I cranked it up all the way.
- My turkey was frozen?
- D.J., it's all my fault.
It was frozen.
I didn't defrost it enough.
Don't feel bad.
At least, we still can have the-- Pie.
- Tell me that didn't happen.
- That didn't happen.
Yes, it did.
I ruined Mom's picture-perfect pumpkin pie.
And I ruined the turkey.
- I'm gonna go talk to D.J. - All right.
And I'll go talk to Stephanie.
Whoa, I'll talk to Stephanie.
Here, you take Michelle.
Oh, by the way, you got a bottle stuck on your tongue.
Another miracle of Thanksgiving.
Turkey.
Dad, you don't have to tell me.
I know I ruined Thanksgiving for everyone.
You didn't ruin anything.
I let Mom down.
Why?
Because of the turkey?
D.J., Mom knew Thanksgiving wasn't about turkeys.
It's about family and about being thankful for what we have.
I'm thankful I've got you.
You're the one who pulled us all together tonight.
You're just trying to make me feel better.
- Is it working?
- No.
You think you feel bad.
I feel worse.
- You couldn't.
- Oh, yeah?
Wait till I tell you what's been going on.
I felt so bad about your frozen turkey that I offered those ladies $200 for theirs.
Dad, that's crazy.
You should've just told me the truth and given me the $200.
That would've made me feel better.
Thanks for making me feel better.
You're welcome.
Sometimes you remind me so much of your mom.
You always have a smile for me when I need one.
Yeah, well, like Mom said, smiles are free, so give them away.
Uncle Jesse, are you still here?
No, I left.
You can come out of the closet now.
Nice try.
All right, that's it.
I'm coming in there with you.
Look out.
I broke the pie.
That's all right.
People break things all the time.
It's okay, no big deal.
Everybody makes mistakes.
Not pie mistakes.
Even pie mistakes.
You know what, I'll show you a mistake I made when I was your age.
Hop on my back, I'll give you a piggyback ride.
Hop on.
There we go.
It's kind of fun hanging out in the closet.
You don't get out much, do you?
All right, come here.
Now you settle down here and be prepared to be amazed at my stupidity.
- Here, come on, sit on my lap.
- Okay.
Take a look at that.
Who's that goofy-looking guy with silly hair and big ears?
I don't have big ears.
They're fine now that your head's bigger.
Why is your hair so lopsided?
That's the thing, see.
When I was 5 and your mom was 10 I let her cut my hair because she said she was in beauty school.
And you believed her?
- Well, I said I was 5.
- I'm 5, and I wouldn't fall for that.
Well, maybe you're just a little smarter than I am, huh, you little ankle-biter?
- Look at this one.
- Oh, yeah.
Hey.
Who's that little girl with you?
That's your mommy.
She's pretty, isn't she?
Yeah.
What's she holding?
Well, in one hand she's holding her scissors and in the other hand she's holding about 95 percent of my hair.
Oh, yeah, that's for Halloween, huh?
- How you guys doing?
- We're cool.
- We're fine.
- Let's go have some black turkey and some pie Ã  la floor.
- Okay, but can we make a new pie?
- Sure, Steph.
I promise not to drop it.
And I promise not to freeze it.
- Okay, let's go.
- Okay, come on.
Let's go eat.
I'm hungry.
You missed a great Thanksgiving, sis.
- You coming?
- Yeah.
Yeah, let's go.
Wait, look at this.
I forgot how much the girls look like Pam when she was their age.
Yeah, right.
Come on, let's go, man.
Wait a second, you wanna talk?
No, why would I wanna talk?
Come on, let's go.
Jesse.
- It's okay if you're hurting.
- I'm not hurting, I'm hungry.
I wanna go eat.
Let's go, please.
I hadn't thought about this.
But this must be real hard on you.
You spent more Thanksgivings with Pam than any of us.
What's it take to get through to you?
I don't wanna have this conversation.
So leave me alone.
Okay.
Fine.
I'll just be moseying along.
But if you wanna talk, you know my home number.
When is it gonna stop hurting, man?
I keep thinking the pain's gonna go away but it doesn't.
I see pictures, I think of her I get this feeling, this em-- I know that feeling, Jesse.
And I don't think it ever completely goes away.
Sometimes it's easier but on days like this, it's real hard.
But you don't have to go through this alone.
I'm missing her, man.
This-- It's so hard for me to talk about it.
Talking about it, that's what helps me.
Talking about the memories.
That's what keeps her in your heart.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Everybody knows the story of how I got my hair all chopped up and everything but I'll bet you don't know how I retaliated.
Look at this.
Did you ever see your wife with red, white and blue hair?
I think she looked cute.
How'd you do this?
Picture this, it was the middle of the night two things of finger paints and vanilla pudding.
I was a wicked little 5-year-old, wasn't I?
I'm glad you're here, Jesse.
Lord, as we gather this Thanksgiving we wanna thank you for this bountiful yet slightly overcooked, reheated meal.
Amen.
But what we're most thankful for is being part of a family who really loves each other.
Amen.
And God bless my mom and dad who are in Orange County with all my dad's goofy relatives.
Amen.
And I'd just like to say I'm happy to be part of this family and God bless my dad and his third wife Janice.
And to my mom who's on a Thanksgiving gambling junket to Atlantic City: Seven come eleven, Mom.
- Amen.
- Carve the turkey, Dad.
My pleasure.
Okay, who wants white meat?
- I do.
I want some.
- Me.
Scratch the white meat.
We have dark meat and really dark meat.
- Yeah.
- All right.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
- Is this normal?
- It is for Joey.
Wait till you hear what happened to me today.
It's amazing.
It's incredible.
It's unbelievable.
- What happened?
Tell us.
- Tell us right now!
- I can't tell you.
- I hate it when he does that.
I'll tell you just as soon as everyone gets home.
Oh, boy, what a day.
Come here, girls.
Give your Uncle J a kiss.
Very nice.
I know how much you look up to me but no matter how glamorous you think my life is don't ever kill bugs for a living.
- Joseph.
- Hey, buddy, insect world got you down?
Well, close your eyes because I am going to send you to a land of sunshine and flowers.
Smell this.
Joey, you've been riding in the dryer again, haven't you?
I'm in a great mood.
I wanna tell you what happened, but I can't yet.
- Uncle Jesse, he's driving us crazy.
- Yeah, make him tell us.
- Okay.
Joey, what's up?
- Can't tell you.
- The man will not crack.
- Hi, girls.
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, Dad.
Bye, girls.
Okay, Joey, we're all here.
Spill your guts.
I've been chosen as one of the hot, up-and-coming comics to go on a two-week, All right.
I knew you'd get a job.
Oh, the man is hot.
Well, there's only one problem.
I'm not sure if I'm gonna go or not.
- Joey.
- Why not?
When I moved in, I made a commitment to help with the girls and cook and clean and do laundry.
I can't just take off like that.
Joey, you have worked too long and too hard to pass this up.
This could be your big break.
You gotta go for it.
You are going.
Yeah, but what about the kids?
Both of you work.
- We'll go with you.
- It's never too early to look at colleges.
Let's get out of kindergarten first.
Listen, it's simple.
I will fill in for Joey.
I'll just take a couple weeks off the bug biz.
- You can do that?
- Yeah, I work for my dad.
He can't fire me, because my ma won't let him.
- You sure you can get along without me?
- Yeah.
Go have fun.
Great.
- Baby, you're the greatest.
- Thanks, Ralph.
Girls.
- You touch me, the deal's off.
- It's too late, I've already started.
That's no penguin.
That's George Bush.
Oh, no.
Thank you.
Thank you.
It's wonderful to be here at Fill-in-the-blank College, home of the fighting.
Some animal.
Oh, no.
Cut it out.
- Just a little confidence builder.
- It's some of your finest work.
Why don't I go upstairs and work on this week's basketball blooper reel.
Joey, there seems to have been an explosion in your alcove which has hurled most of your possessions to the four corners of the living room.
I'm sorry.
I love this machine.
Look, Danny.
I'll clean up, okay?
You go work on your blooper reel, and I'll get back to writing college material.
Now get out of here.
Steph, what are you doing?
I'm practicing for my next honeybee meeting.
- That's nice, but I'm trying to rehearse.
- Go ahead.
It won't bother me.
Hey, Jess.
I'm looking for a place to rehearse.
Good luck.
Uncle Jesse, I'm trying to do my homework.
Sorry.
I bet you Chuck Berry didn't have to live with three nieces.
Michelle.
Michelle, are you busy?
- Sorry.
I didn't know you had company.
- Sorry.
I didn't know you had company.
Bye.
Cut it out.
You people are too much.
Quit it.
Get out of here.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, a dramatic presentation.
A little something I like to call "Ode to a Fountain".
Joey, that looks so real.
When I see you do your fountain act, I wanna throw pennies on your face and make a wish.
Well, just wish that I do that well on the tour.
Oh, you'll be great.
I finished my homework, so you can rehearse in my room.
But please don't spit on my bed.
No, D.J., it's okay.
The garage really isn't that bad.
It's freezing.
Your wrap, madame.
I didn't know you kept your clothes in your car.
Well, that alcove is so small.
But my trunk makes a good closet.
The worst part, D.J., is not having any privacy.
I know what you mean.
I live with a so that she'd have someone to play with.
- Not that I'm complaining.
- Oh, of course not.
D.J., in my pre-alcove days, I lived like a king.
I had my own door, four walls and a light switch.
It was Camelot.
Not that I'm complaining.
Well, my pre-Stephanie days my Bananarama poster didn't have to share the wall with Rainbow Brite.
- Not that I'm complaining.
- Not that I'm complaining.
Well, if you need a place to keep your socks, my bike basket is all yours.
Thanks, D.J., but I keep my socks in the glove compartment.
If you'll do me a favor, get me another glass of water so I can finish washing the car.
You got it.
And it was just so sad.
I mean, there was Joey, alone in the cold garage, spitting water onto the air - for nobody.
- That is sad.
It could've been worse.
We could've had to watch it.
Right, Michelle?
Dad, Joey has no place to rehearse.
Isn't there something we can all do to help him?
What Joey really needs is his own room.
Yes, you're right.
Joey needs a room.
Okay, let's stop and think about this.
Darn, no rooms.
Oh, well, we thought about it.
I'm kidding.
I'm joking.
I-- See?
She knows I'm joking.
- Daddy.
- What?
- Joey's not here yet.
- Time-out, Stephanie.
Honey, let's have a little talk about this lookout thing.
The key is to let us know when Joey is coming, not when Joey is not coming.
- This is harder than I thought.
- No, sweetie, it's easy.
All you have to do is, when you see Joey coming you give us the secret code.
- The duck flies at midnight.
- "The duck flies at midnight".
I should get paid for this.
Okay, I got this all figured out.
Now, if I move into Michelle's room, Joey moves into my room Michelle moves into the alcove, and Stephanie gets a tent in the back yard.
- I don't think so.
- Okay, plan B. If we put bunk beds in Jesse's room that means Uncle Jesse and Joey could be roommates.
Great idea, huh?
I don't think so.
- Oh, here you are.
- The duck, the turtle the chicken drives to 7-Eleven.
At midnight.
It's a new catch phrase.
All the kids are saying it.
Well, what's going on in here?
Well, we're doing this new family ritual where we sing Michelle to sleep.
A new family ritual?
Why didn't you guys call me?
Why didn't we call-- Well, that's simple too.
What it is, we're doing this four-part harmony thing tonight, and-- Well, here we go.
One, two, three, four.
We've gotta get Joey out of that alcove.
Yeah, you're right.
- Why didn't--?
- The duck!
The duck!
Jess, the girls' after-school activities for the next two weeks are in blue except for D.J.'s dental appointment, which is in green.
And I put the cleaning schedule in pink.
Alex, I'll take dental appointments for 50.
- Good morning, my friends.
- Good morning.
You guys are just in time.
We've got your eggs, bacon, toast, milk, orange juice and the morning paper.
Sports section on the top.
It looks like Jesse.
It sounds like Jesse.
I think I'll keep him.
Hey, all Hazel's done so far is make breakfast.
- What do you guys think?
- They're great.
I'll have seconds.
Seconds?
Okay.
Seconds for you and seconds for you.
All right?
How come nobody ever asks for a second helping of my eggs?
So, Jess - did Michelle eat?
- Yeah, like a horse.
She's sleeping it off.
Way to go, Jess.
I'm sorry.
I'm late for work.
Joey, buddy, you are on your way.
Knock them dead.
Blow them away.
You're gonna kill them.
You're in a very violent business.
See you guys later.
- Thanks.
Made myself an Egg McJesse.
- All right.
Did you think of an alternative to Joey's alcove problem?
Not yet, but I stayed up all night thinking about it.
- I thought you had a date.
- Okay, I stayed up all night.
- Well, let's keep thinking.
- All right.
See you.
- Bye, girls.
- Bye, Dad.
- It's the bus.
- I'm sorry.
I forgot to pack your lunches.
- Feed bags, young ladies.
- Thanks, Uncle Jesse.
- You're welcome.
- Bye, Joey.
- Bye.
- Bye, Joey.
Have fun.
- Thanks.
Bye.
- We'll see you in a month.
- In two weeks.
- Joseph, you better get going, man.
- You're gonna be late.
- Now, Jess - remember, I left all the important-- - Joey, we can take care of it.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
We don't need you.
Now go.
T-C- Take care of business.
Come on.
Go.
L-R- Leave right now.
In other words, W-A-Y- Why aren't you gone?
Go.
Okay.
I'm going.
Hi, Michelle.
Yeah.
No, I haven't left yet, but I'm going for two weeks.
Something's going on here.
I mean, they're having family rituals without me.
I can be replaced like that by a rock 'n' roll exterminator.
Maybe they don't need me.
Yeah, I know.
I think you're the only one who cares about me.
Here, give me a kiss.
Okay.
Bye, Michelle.
Okay.
You stay right there.
Tell everyone I'll miss them, if they care.
Bye.
We'll be right back with Judge Wapner's decision after this.
Hang that dry cleaner, Judge Wapner.
Hang him!
All right.
We got the housework done.
Time for a little dessert.
Here you go.
Who's your favorite uncle?
I know.
It's me.
Go ahead.
All right.
You know what time it is, pal?
It's time for a little game I like to call "Michelle Ball".
Like this: All right, listen.
We'll go answer the door, but when we come back you'll throw me up in the air and blow bubbles on my tummy, okay?
Get it?
Blow bubbles on-- I'll get the door.
- Oh, hi, Joanie.
- Hi, Jesse.
Hi, Michelle.
- Where's Joey?
- Joey's out, and I'm taking over for him.
Oh, good, because it's Joey's afternoon.
- Joey's afternoon?
For what?
- To watch the kids.
To watch the ki-- The kids.
I watch Michelle on Tuesdays and the other moms take turns the rest of the week.
- The other moms?
- Yeah, like Barbara and Janice.
- Barbara and Janice.
Barbara.
- Hi, Joanie.
Hi, Jesse.
- Hi, Michelle.
Hi, Robbie.
- Hi, everybody.
Jesse, my Robbie doesn't get along with Barb's Benji - so try and keep them separated.
- Here I thought I'd have nothing to do.
Hi, Jesse.
Hi, Barbara.
Hi, Joanie.
Hi, Ryan.
Hi, Robbie.
Hi, Michelle.
Thank you very much for coming.
Go ahead, my friend.
Listen, I'm very good with children.
You go have fun.
- Have a nice day.
Shop.
Come back.
- Okay.
Bye.
Bye-bye, girls.
Thank you.
Bye-bye, girls.
Bye, girls.
And we thank you.
Attention, all crumb-gobblers.
Joseph's out of town.
Big J's in charge here.
It's quite simple.
I can be your best friend or your worst enemy.
- The choice is yours.
- Laundry fight.
- Bad choice.
- Listen, I spent all day cleaning.
Gentlemen, listen, I think-- We should throw laundry this afternoon.
Thank you.
Thanks very much.
Thank you.
How would Cosby handle this?
- I miss Joey already.
- Yeah, me too.
Not like I miss him.
Uncle Jesse, maybe we should eat without Daddy.
- Sometimes he comes home real late.
- But a family should always eat together.
Now, we'll give your father five more minutes, okay?
Could we start on some vegetables?
Did I say vegetables?
I must be starving.
Hi, honey, I'm home.
- Hi, girls.
- Hi, Dad.
I'm sorry I'm late.
I had to rush out to cover a Warriors practice session.
- Traffic was miserable-- - Give me a break.
- Huh?
- Don't "huh" me.
You waltz in here 25 minutes late and expect sympathy?
- Well, I didn't know you-- - I have cleaned the house and washed and ironed your clothes and ran a daycare center for socially deviant munchkins and missed Oprah.
Ran this one to a ballet lesson, this one to the dentist.
No cavities.
Do you realize that I have slaved over a hot stove so you could have a hot meal when you come home, huh?
- Jesse, I'm sorry.
- "Sorry".
"Sorry".
Sorry doesn't change the fact that my chicken tetrazzini is ruined.
Ruined.
It's all dried out.
But do you have the common courtesy to call me and tell me you're going to be Well, I am not an animal.
Oh, my God.
What's happening to me?
I'm turning into June Cleaver.
You are a beautiful human being.
Jesse, the first day is always the toughest.
Hey, my sad little soldier.
This will perk you up.
I figured out the perfect solution to Joey's alcove problem.
I talked to some contractors and during the next two weeks, we are going to build Joey his own bedroom.
Good idea!
Oh, great.
Another room for me to clean.
Uncle Jesse, your chicken's pretty good.
Yeah, it's just a little dry.
I'm back.
The duck flies at midnight!
- I got it!
- Okay.
Everybody be cool.
- Don't say a thing.
- Okay.
Whose turn is it?
- What do you got?
- I'd like to buy Indiana.
- All right.
$500.
- Okay.
Don't forget the change.
- There you go.
All right, whose turn is it?
- Hello.
- Hi, Joe.
- Hi, Joey.
- Whose turn is it?
- How did the college tour go?
Fine.
Real good.
How did everything go here?
Oh, real cool.
The house is cool.
Kids are cool.
There's Peking duck in the fridge for you.
Just out of curiosity, would anybody happen to know where all my stuff is?
Yeah, we moved it down to the garage.
- I see.
- I think it's your turn.
Well, maybe there's something else you'd like to tell me, like goodbye.
- Joey.
- AdiÃ³s.
Am-scray.
- Joey.
- Hit the road, Joey.
Joey, your stuff is in the garage.
Go check it out.
Oh, I'll check it out, and then I'll pack it up.
You just threw all my stuff down in the garage?
Why didn't you just fling it out on the front lawn?
Am I still getting my mail here, or did you forward it to the gutter?
I didn't demand to move in here.
I volunteered to help out.
And if you didn't need my help, all you had to say was-- Joey is an idiot.
I got a bathroom, my Jets, Manny, my bed.
- I love it!
- You deserve it!
- How'd you guys get my old furniture?
- Your mom.
- What happened to the junk down here?
- Attic.
- Where's your motorcycle?
- Back yard.
- Hey, where are we gonna park our cars?
- Street.
This was the garage?
Danny, this must've cost a fortune.
Don't ask.
Joey, you're my best friend and you're doing me the biggest favor of my life by helping me raise my girls.
This is just our way of saying thanks.
No one has ever done anything like this for me before.
And the best part is, as great as my new room is you guys really want me here.
Are you kidding?
You're a part of our family.
Face it, pal.
You're a Tanner.
Welcome home, Joseph.
Tomorrow, you're on the day shift.
Steph, I got great news.
This means you can move into the alcove.
You're too good to me.
It's all yours.
Thanks for the room, everybody.
- Forward your mail to the gutter, huh?
- Fling your stuff on the lawn, huh?
I was kidding.
I'm a comedian in the kidding business.
Kid this, buddy.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
All right, girls, now, not one word about your dad's surprise party tonight, okay?
- That means you, Steph.
- What makes you think I'm gonna tell him?
Because you blew dad's surprise party last year.
I was only 4.
Give me a break.
Steph, this is an important birthday.
Your dad turns the big 30.
How much more than 5 is the big 30?
Well, here, I'll show you.
This is you.
And this is your daddy.
Wow, he's almost a whole box old.
Make way.
It's the Goodyear birthday blimp.
I had to take a couple balloons off.
She was getting picked up by radar.
Your dad's on his way down.
Stephanie, I heard about last year.
Do not spoil the surprise party.
Man, one little mistake.
- Good morning, everyone.
- Happy birthday!
Okay, it's been said.
Now we can just move on and forget the fact that I'm.
I'm.
- Thirty.
- Thirty.
Thank you.
Okay.
Anyway, I don't turn.
Turn.
- Thirty.
- Thirty.
Thank you.
I don't turn what you just said until 8:15.
- Dad, it's 8:20.
- Oh, my God.
Dad, this is a present from Michelle, Steph and me.
Look at this.
"D.J., Stephanie and Michelle's coupon book".
This is great.
And you made it yourselves.
I love this.
"D.J. and Stephanie will change Michelle's diaper".
- I'll hold on to this.
- I'm sorry, Jesse, they're not transferable.
"And a free car wash for my car, Bullet".
Do you realize I bought that car Every time I get behind the wheel, put the top down and start blasting my self-improvement tapes, I feel like a kid again.
Boy, you were born to raise heck.
Dad, that must be another birthday surprise.
Look at them run.
Did I ever run like that?
You bet.
You always ran like a girl.
Come on, Grandpa.
I'll help you across the living room floor.
You shouldn't be so cocky.
Just because you're 24, and I'm.
I'm.
- Thirty.
- Thirty.
Come on, Michelle.
All right, girls.
Tell our lucky contestant what's behind door number one.
Vanna, Carol Merrill.
I won a man?
Not just any man.
Jimmy, tell him what he's won.
Okay, Bob.
Danny Tanner, you'll be riding in style because you've won your very own chauffeur-driven limousine for a day.
It's a stretch limousine, complete with a bar, TV, telephone and a year's supply of calendars: one.
You guys have gone all out.
This is terrific.
I wish you hadn't gone to such expense.
We didn't.
I'm gonna fumigate his house for free.
I can't say it enough.
God bless silverfish.
You wanna ride to school in a limo?
I'd love to ride in a limo.
But can it take us somewhere else besides school?
- Let's hit the mall.
- All right, Steph.
You're going to school.
Let's go.
Thanks for a terrific birthday.
Okay, I want one thing: I want you to remember I do not want a party.
- This will be our secret.
- Okay.
- All right.
Sure.
- Fine.
- I mean it.
No party.
- Fine.
- Back to the party.
- Well, Bob, I pick up the decorations at 2-- - Done with the voice.
- Okay.
Food arrives at 5.
Belly dancer arrives at 5:30.
Belly dancer leaves at 6.
Guests arrive at 6:30.
Limo drops Danny here at home at 7.
- What about his present?
- I'm leaving work early I'm gonna take Bullet, get him fitted for seat covers.
He is gonna love them.
- Boy, he really loves this car.
- Hey, who wouldn't?
I mean you're talking about a car that goes from zero to 60 in two weeks.
Now, Steph, do it just the way I told you.
D.J., I'm old enough to carry a tray of "appezizers".
"Attepizers".
Cheese sticks.
Excuse me, do you care about cheese?
- Thank you, Stephanie.
- Steph.
It's, "Do you care for cheese"?
She took one, didn't she?
All right, good night.
Thanks for dragging it home.
Sure, pal.
Good luck.
Poor Bullet.
Maybe Danny won't notice.
Boy, am I in trouble.
Joey?
Jesse, what's wrong?
I've never seen your face this shade of green before.
- This must be serious.
- It is.
Uncle Jesse, is something wrong?
I'm getting these vibes.
Yeah, something's very wrong.
I knew it.
This is great.
I'm sorry, but I'm developing women's intuition.
It's a big step in my life.
Listen, your father's car has been in a little accident.
- How little?
- Big little.
Follow me.
Come here.
I want you guys to take a look.
You're dead meat.
Boy, this is gonna take all the fun out of those seat covers.
- What are you gonna do?
- What do you mean?
I'm gonna do what I have to do, I'm gonna tell him the truth.
When we're in trouble, we give the "we're the cutest little girls in the world" look.
That may work for you girls, but I don't have those cute little dimples.
Well, maybe if you put a pretty little bow in your hair or something.
- Not funny.
- Danny's coming up the steps.
Come on.
- What do we do?
- Okay, here's the plan.
- First, we hide the seat covers.
- Hide the seat covers.
All right.
- Now what?
- It's tough enough for Danny turning 30.
It's his birthday.
Promise me you're not gonna ruin it.
- I promise.
- Then we have to make sure he has the best time he's ever had in his life.
- Good, we'll do that.
- Then, in the afterglow you set him down and gently rip his heart out.
- Can't you come up with a happier ending?
- The car fairy shows up and makes everything wonderful.
Quiet, everyone.
Let's see, 15 of my friends' cars parked right out front.
I wonder.
Surprise!
I don't believe this.
Happy birthday!
Thank you.
This is great.
I love this.
Everybody's here.
This is so nice.
All my friends from the station are here.
Are we running a test pattern tonight?
Cousin Ed.
- Why aren't you running your fishing boat?
- What, and miss your 19th birthday party?
I am so glad you're here.
Daddy, would you care for some cheese?
Oh, yes, Stephanie.
Thank you.
This is too easy.
I'm ready for dip.
Oh, there you are, you birthday nuts.
- I thought I told you no party.
- You say that every year.
This is the last surprise, isn't it?
Well.
I just want you to know that Jesse deserves all the credit.
This whole party was his idea because he loves you.
- Right.
- Always remember that.
Please.
- Jesse, I know you hate when I hug you-- - Hey, I got an idea.
It's your birthday.
What the heck, why don't I hug you this time.
Brother-in-law.
- Say "cheese".
- Cheese.
We'll call this the "before" picture.
Open that one.
Danny, if you don't like it, there's no way I can return it, so you'd better like it.
Caroline, this is great.
Last time Danny went fishing on my boat, he didn't catch a thing.
So I mounted his bait.
Hey, I'm just out there for the fresh air.
Daddy, I found another present.
- No, no, no.
- No, no, no.
- You never saw me.
- The gifts just keep on coming.
Look at this.
"From Jesse and Joey to Bullet and Danny".
Oh, great.
Wow, sheepskin seat covers for Bullet.
- I could cry.
- Oh, you will.
I'm gonna go try these on right now.
Excuse me.
I think now would be a good time to tell him.
Danny.
Listen, before you go out there, I wanna tell you something.
Bullet was in an accident.
- Is he all right?
- No.
Okay, I'm coming out of Pep Boys, right with your wonderful yet essentially useless party gift and this idiot plowed into Bullet.
It sends him down the hill through this guardrail, into the air, where he did a full gainer he lands in the bay and sank like a stone.
But look, Bullet went out with a blaze of glory.
For a second, you had me going.
He sank to the bottom of the bay.
Do you know what a car would look like if it sank to the bottom of the bay?
We'll call this the "after" picture.
Daddy, are you all right?
Of course, sweetheart.
I'm fine.
That's the same smile Jack Nicholson had in The Shining.
Maybe it just needs a little touch-up paint.
Look, Danny, I'm gonna make this up to you, I promise.
I accept all responsibility.
Even though it was the fault of the Spanish missionaries for being so dumb to build a city on so many hills that go-- Hey, pal, I'm fine.
These things happen.
Que serÃ¡ serÃ¡ Ob-la-di, ob-la-da.
Life goes on.
Bra.
Drop the act.
Every weekend you're out here polishing and waxing this thing.
It's ruined.
The outside's ruined, the inside's ruined.
The handle's actually in good shape.
Jesse, it's not about the hundreds of hours of labor he poured into this car.
It's about 10 years of memories.
Danny, this car was with you through the tough years.
It drove you to your first real job.
Then it helped you raise a family.
Man, this car was your 20s.
That's good, we lost the phony smile.
Very good.
All right.
Get in touch with your anger, man.
Let it all out.
Hit me.
Go ahead, hit me.
No, I got a better idea.
Hit the car.
Hit the car.
Let it go, let it go.
Go ahead.
Doesn't that feel better?
Feels good, right?
I can honestly say that this is one birthday I will never forget.
Good night.
- Good night, girls.
- Good night.
Oh, and thank you very much for the lovely seat covers.
Probably not the best time for birthday cake.
Look, honey, it's Mr. Dog.
What does Mr. Dog say?
I may be holding the first woman president.
Yes.
Look, it's Mr. Pig.
What does Mr. Pig say?
Close enough.
Let's go for three.
It's Mr. Car.
What does Mr. Car say?
You're right.
He doesn't say anything because he's dead.
Good morning.
How you guys doing?
- What are you doing up?
- Thought I heard Michelle crying.
No, that was me.
- Can I hold her?
- Sure.
Come here, sweetie.
Come on, buddy.
Cheer up.
It's just a car.
Actually, it's a big, wet lawn sculpture.
Come on.
I dare you to look at this baby and not smile.
Hi, Daddy.
It's me, it's me.
Cheer up.
There you go.
Attaboy.
See?
Now who cares about a car?
Joey, it's more than just the car.
I'm talking about the big picture.
Who are we?
Where are we going?
Why do we have to get there so fast?
We're Joey and Danny and we're going down into the kitchen.
We're going there fast, because it we don't Jesse will eat all the microwave pancakes.
Remember back in junior high school when we had wood shop with old man Pafco?
Yeah, I remember that old geezer.
Joey, old man Pafco was 27.
Seems like yesterday you were saying, "I wonder what it's like in the real world getting a job, being a grownup".
I did say that yesterday.
- Hello.
- Hey, Jess.
Jess, it's all right.
Come on in.
Hello, Michelle.
Come here.
- You still mad at me?
- I know what happened wasn't your fault.
I'm gonna make it up to you.
Joseph, get dressed.
We're taking a ride.
- Where are we going?
- Are you gonna be home today?
Where am I going?
I got no car and I'm an old man who just turned.
I just turned.
- Thirty.
- Thirty.
Thank you.
- I got a big surprise for you.
- No more surprises.
No, no.
This surprise you're gonna love.
Come on, Joey.
One more for the road.
Irresistible.
I can't keep my lips off her tummy.
He's right, you're habit-forming.
- Yes.
- All right.
- Look at this car.
- Yes.
Same color-- This thing looks just like Bullet.
All right.
Thank you.
I'll see you on Sunday.
This is Bullet's twin brother.
How'd you find him?
Simple, I picked up the phone and dialed every dealer in northern California.
But it doesn't matter, I found you.
Why am I talking to you?
We're going to buy you, we're gonna take you home and Danny's gonna be so happy.
- Oh, we did it.
- Joe, Joe, Joe.
It's gonna be difficult to get a good price for the car if you're actually kissing the car.
Right.
What am I doing?
Listen, this is important.
Danny's getting The important thing is we get this car for 11,700.
Excuse me, is there something I can help you fine gentlemen with?
Oh, I don't know.
We're just browsing around, look at a car-- How about this one?
I mean what's the story on Bullet-- On this car here?
Twelve grand.
Twelve grand?
I wouldn't pay a nickel over 11,700.
Paul's Classic Cars.
Paul himself.
- We got you.
- You won't believe this but I've got a guy on the phone right now who's offering 12 grand for that car sight unseen.
He's bluffing us, Joseph.
Watch me.
I'll play into it.
Okay, fine.
No 11,700, we're walking out the door, and we ain't coming back.
He'll stop us.
Watch.
Goodbye, Paul.
- Well, see you, Paul.
- We're gone.
Bye-bye, Paulie.
- Running out the door.
- We're gone.
- We're going.
- Bye-bye, Paulie.
AdiÃ³s, Paul.
Congratulations, sir.
When can you come pick it up?
Hi, Paul.
12,100.
I'm sorry, sir, I just received an offer of 12,100.
- I'll give you 12,500.
- Go, Daddy, go.
- 12,500 dollars.
- 13,000.
- 13,000.
- 14,000.
- I'll kick in and extra 20.
- Count me in for 73 cents.
They're up to $14,020.73.
We gotta get Danny this car.
$14,020.75 cents.
We got them on the ropes.
$14,020.75.
- What's he up to, Dad?
- He went up 2 cents.
I got a loose tooth.
Whatever the tooth fairy gives me, it's yours.
- 15,000.
- I got 15,000.
- Do I hear 16,000?
- 16,000.
- I got $17,000.
- That doesn't count.
- The yahoo bird bid against me.
- Too late, he's up to 18,000 now.
You tell him that I'm gonna pay anything for that car, I'm gonna pay 20,000 bucks.
- $20,000.
- $20,000?
I'm going crazy over a car I haven't seen.
Look, I gotta send my daughters to college.
It's only a car.
Let the other guy have it.
He went up another thousand.
But I think that car can be yours for only $22,000.
We went from 11,700 to $22,000.
How are we gonna pay that?
- You know how many jokes I have to tell?
- You know how many bugs I have to kill?
We'll just get Danny's car somewhere else.
- Give it to the other guy.
- Boys, boys, let's not be hasty here.
Did I say $22,000?
Well, I actually meant 21.
Twenty?
Nineteen?
How about 11,500, Paul?
- Sold.
- Yes.
Can I interest you in a service contract?
Write up the car, Paul.
- Danny.
Daniel.
- Hey, guys.
I'm glad you're here.
- I've got some great news.
- So do we.
- Let me tell you mine first.
- Okay.
Do you remember when I thought the only car I could ever love was Bullet?
- Yes.
- Well, I was wrong.
Wouldn't I look good behind the wheel of a Jeep Wagoneer?
Look at this.
Rear track-lock differential.
Self-sealing radials, antitheft ignition.
I can't wait to find out what these things mean.
- You can't be serious.
- Of course I am.
In fact, I even called a dealership and started bidding on a car exactly like Bullet.
But there was this yo-yo there that kept hiking up the price.
It was crazy.
So I just said bye-bye Bullet.
I went car shopping, and, guys, I fell in love.
So tomorrow I am buying my first new car ever.
I hope you're not planning on using your insurance check.
- What are you talking about?
- That was our little surprise.
We got you a birthday gift.
Take a look.
You two were the yo-yos?
- Yo.
- Yo.
I love that car.
I thought you said bye-bye Bullet.
To the old Bullet.
You have to move on in life.
So move on to your Wagoneer.
What better symbol for the next decade than a gift from my two best friends?
Birthdays aren't about numbers, they're about who you spend them with.
You guys made this one great.
You really wanna keep the car?
Absolutely.
Thank you.
Happy birthday.
Again.
You know what really feels nice?
For the first time, it feels great to be 30.
He said it.
What are you gonna name him?
Bullet Jr.?
Come on, Joey, a 30-year-old man doesn't name his car.
- Go get the kids.
Let's go for a spin.
- Let's go get them.
- Stephanie.
- D.J. I'll be right back, Walter.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
So, Kimmy, wanna stay for dinner?
Maybe.
What are you having?
Joey's cooking, so I'm not really sure.
It's something in an earth tone.
Pass.
But if my dog Sinbad is hungry, I'll send him over.
Don't do that.
I love Sinbad.
Stephanie, why are you following us?
Because you keep leaving me.
Steph, I know you're only 5 and you have no life of your own but Kimmy and I are talking woman-to-woman.
I'm a woman.
I'm a little woman, but I'm a woman.
Steph, when Kimmy leaves, you and I can have a nice sister-to-sister talk unless I get a phone call.
You're so good to me.
Did you guys hear that noise?
It sounded like a monster.
Steph, you're always making up monster noises.
There's nothing to worry about.
Although you do look like that kid in Poltergeist who got sucked up in the TV and said, "They're back".
Real funny.
You gonna love this, Michelle.
- Hi.
- Hi!
How you doing?
How you doing?
Hey, Michelle.
Hey, Jesse, some woman named Brianna called.
She said she'll meet you at 8:00.
Who's Brianna?
Well, I terminated her termites, and she wanted to thank me so we came up with a few ideas, if you will.
You went out wearing a cockroach on your back and you came back with a date?
Joey, don't beat around the bush.
You wanna borrow my jumpsuit, just say so.
Uncle Jesse, something horrible is in the house.
You're telling me.
Hey, grab Michelle.
Help me set the table.
All right.
Come on, Michelle.
Great news.
I've got great news.
Thank goodness you're home.
I missed you too, honey.
Did you miss all of me or just my leg?
Stephanie thinks she heard a monster in the garage.
But if you ask me, it's just a desperate plea for attention.
D.J., stop watching Oprah and start doing your homework.
So now you're hearing a garage monster instead of just that closet monster.
Which, by the way, honey, we never really found.
Maybe because the closet monster moved into the garage.
Just to catch everybody up I walked in here saying, "Hey, great news, great news".
I got great news.
I met a girl today.
That's not news.
That's sports.
Let's give Dad a break.
So, what's your "great news, great news"?
Okay.
Thank you.
As you all know, the TV stations in this city are fighting each other for better ratings.
Congratulations, Daddy.
Steph, honey, that's not the great news.
Anyway, my station is putting together a special promo, like a little commercial about each of its newscasters.
Now, here comes the great news: - They've picked your father to be first.
- Oh, great.
Yeah.
- Good.
- Great.
All right.
I feel the energy.
Oh, by the way you're all gonna be on TV with me.
Yeah!
Oh, I knew you'd be happy for me.
So they're coming to the house tomorrow to film our whole family.
- All right.
I like that.
- Yeah.
All right, everybody chow down.
Should we send out for pizza or Chinese?
Pizza.
It is pizza.
"They're back".
Steph, did you make that noise?
Why would I make a noise that's scaring me to death?
Could I sleep with you in your bed?
All right.
Come on over.
Does this mean you believe me about the monster?
I'm not saying yes and I'm not saying no.
I'm just saying, "Get over here".
What if he's under the bed waiting to eat my feet?
Reel me in, D.J. Faster!
Faster!
Bless you.
You forgot to turn out the light.
Forget the light.
Run for your life!
- Monster!
- Help!
Mon ster!
What's going on?
We got the monster trapped in our room.
Go get it, Uncle Jesse.
You're a creepy-crawler killer.
I am a pest control specialist, thank you.
Pardon me.
Go kill it!
Jesse, humor them.
Unless there is something creepy and crawly in there in which case, go kill it.
You know, in every movie the hero is always a soldier, a cop, a private eye.
Never once-- Never once have they made a movie about the real American hero: The exterminator.
- Pest control specialist.
- Pest control specialist.
Coming soon to a theater near you.
Daddy, can I sleep with you in your bed tonight?
Oh, honey, you don't want to sleep in my bed, do you?
I guess not.
Your uncle Jesse says your room is monster-free so I'm only staying here until you two fall asleep.
Okay, Dad.
All right, Daddy.
And you two need your sleep because tomorrow a nice lady is coming here and she's gonna make a little movie about our family.
And, girls, there are no such things as monsters.
The closest thing in real life are linebackers.
But they're much bigger than monsters, and they make a lot more money.
Get it, girls?
More money.
Girls?
Good night.
Okay.
The joys of fatherhood.
- Come on.
- Michelle, this is your big TV debut.
Let's give you that Marilyn Monroe look.
Kind of, bangs sweeping to the left.
Kind of, the curls framing the face, huh?
She could pull it off but I think it'd be a crime to cover that pretty little face.
See, I say we pull it back, give her a more sophisticated kind of look.
More the Madonna/Brigitte Nielsen kind of thing.
Like this.
See?
Look.
That's Jack Nicholson.
Why don't we give her kind of a Pebbles Flintstone kind of a. A fun do.
That's Don King.
- Maybe just a bow.
- Bow.
Good idea.
Simple, yet it screams style.
- I'll hold it up like this.
- Okay.
- Finger.
- Okay, tie it first.
There we go.
- All right, good.
- There you go.
Finger.
Should we get her Weeboks or her Little Glens?
Which one?
- One of each.
- Okay.
Got that.
You didn't just.
- Yeah, I think I did.
- That's what I thought.
Baby yo-yo.
- Take it off.
- All right.
Hear that noise?
- The girls were right.
It's the monster.
- It's not a monster.
Now, I have to hear where it's coming from.
Be quiet.
North American silver-footed ferret.
Adult male, 2 and a half pounds.
I'd say, from the echo, he's heading towards the garage.
- How can you possibly know this?
- It's a gift.
All right, come on out, pal.
This is your last warning.
Get out now, or be another notch on my spray gun.
Michelle, I'm sorry you had to see that.
But this hairdo-- Now, this, it's beautiful.
It is you.
Lookit, huh?
Isn't that just lovely?
Look at that.
Yes.
Okay, now that'll be $84.
All right, how about just a kiss?
Come on.
Uncle Jesse, that could be the TV lady.
Do we look okay?
You guys look beautiful.
I'm hot on the trail of your monster.
Nail him, Uncle Jesse.
Hi.
Are you the lady who's gonna put us on TV?
Yes, I am, because you are so adorable.
Let me see you smile.
Wonderful.
Let me see if you can find a place to put my coat.
Adorable, and you take direction too.
My name's Ronnie.
That's short for Veronica.
I'm D.J. That's short for Donna Jo.
I'm Stephanie.
I'm just short.
Girls, do you know where your daddy is?
Daddy has been delayed in editing because the satellite downlink malfunctioned due to freakish barometric conditions.
Ronnie feels like such a dodo-head.
So this is your home.
Colors are workable.
Nice angles.
Yes.
I'm seeing some shots.
What are we doing?
We thought you knew.
All right, pal.
Come on out.
Just you and me.
Man versus ferret.
Come on.
Who are you trying to catch?
Phil Niekro?
No, Joseph, I have to improvise.
I left my tools in the car.
Listen, in order to catch a ferret, you must become one with the ferret.
Oh, sure.
Like this?
Joey, when you were a kid, did you fall out of a tree house?
Yeah.
There he is.
Look out!
I got him.
- I got him.
All right.
- What are you gonna do to him?
Think of it this way: I'm moving SeÃ±or Ferret one step up into his spiritual enlightenment.
What's the next step up for a ferret?
Somewhere between rat and lawyer.
Give me the net.
Well, if you were going after a lawyer, I'd be behind you but we're talking about one of God's innocent little creatures.
Go!
Run, ferret!
Go, go!
Let go.
There he goes.
I got him.
I got-- Right through the crack, up the wall, right into the crawlspace.
Slick.
Slick move, SeÃ±or Ferret.
Very good.
It's been a long time since I've been challenged.
Come out with your paws up.
Okay, zig to the right.
Zag to the left.
Go, ferret, go!
Go, ferret, go!
Gone, ferret, gone!
Damn.
He lives.
- Joey, give me the ladder.
- Not until we have a talk.
- Talk.
- Promise me, if you capture the ferret you'll let him go in a safe and pleasant environment.
Okay, fine.
I'll capture him, I'll buy him a little ferret condo fix him up with a hot little mink, and send him to Club Med for the winter.
Okay.
But now let's talk about major medical.
Help me down, here.
Come on.
- I got you.
- Good.
- Hello.
- Hello.
These guys help take care of us.
This is Danny Tanner's family?
- I'm Jesse.
- I'm Joey.
I'm in trouble.
People, we're almost ready.
Hi, I'm Danny Tanner.
- I've been looking forward - Great, you're here.
Let's go.
to meeting you.
Well, that's the last of it.
Joey, where are you going with Jupiter?
Ronnie suggested that I move out.
- Why would Ronnie suggest that?
- No, Danny, it's okay.
No problem.
A successful comedian like myself doesn't need exposure on TV.
Working in parks and train stations is my rocket to stardom.
Ronnie, don't you think Joey is important?
Important?
Why, he's essential.
He is going to be holding the cue cards.
Thank you, Joey.
Oh, no.
Thank you, Ronnie.
You've given my life new meaning.
You know, Danny, so many sportscasters are your typical, macho, two-fisted, iron-pumping ex-jocks.
Yeah, that's me in a nutshell.
Well, Danny Tanner, I am gonna set you apart from the crowd.
I'm gonna sell your family with class, style, sophistication.
That's me too.
There are so many "me's".
Great.
We're just gonna do this one rehearsal.
If you have any problems-- Well, you won't.
Outside.
Don't come in till I say "action".
Okay, everybody over here.
Come on, let's go.
All right, ready?
You back here.
And action!
Ciao, family.
"Ciao, family"?
Continue.
Okay, this is the Italian me: Ciao, famiglia.
Sofa.
To the sofa.
Okay, everybody around.
Yes.
Good.
Here we go.
Sit.
- Cue da Vinci.
- Da Vinci?
Why is there a four-legged marshmallow on my lap?
Danny, this is no froufrou poodle.
This is a man's poodle.
This is a poodle on steroids.
Cue the girls.
Girls, girls.
Da Vinci's a wrap.
Good day, Donna Jo.
And a good day to you too, little Stephanie.
Oh, Father, how excellent to see you.
We missed you, Papa.
I'm confused.
Are we French or Italian?
Or Roquefort?
Girls, sit.
Cue housekeeper.
Heigh-ho.
Teatime at the Tanners'.
- Now we're English?
- No, no, you silly bloke.
I'm the English one, you twit.
Thank you so much, Mr. French.
You're welcome, Uncle Bill.
Excuse me.
Buffy, Jody.
Now you know why I didn't fight too hard to stay in this thing.
What does this have to do with our family?
People, focus.
Crew, over by the door.
Let's go.
And you, right here.
Good.
And cue the baby Michelle.
Oh, baby Michelle.
Come to Daddy, honey.
Hi, Daddy.
Hi, honey.
Oh, she's so cute.
She's so adorable.
Who is she?
She's your adopted daughter.
We thought it'd be great for your image.
- Honey, is your mommy or daddy nearby?
- In the kitchen.
In the kitchen, okay.
Well, you go in there and see them.
She's so cute.
Almost as cute as my little baby.
Where is my baby?
I wanted to go for the adopted daughter.
Actually, Michelle just wasn't quite right for the part.
You're saying my daughter wasn't right for the part of my daughter?
I auditioned for the part and I came that close.
I don't believe this.
How could you guys let yourselves get talked into this?
Well, we knew how important it was to you and we played along, just in case you actually went for this crazy cartoon.
I don't think you understand.
Television news is a very competitive market.
You gotta do something different.
You gotta make a noise, make a splash.
I think you splashed down from another planet.
Wait.
I'm getting a vision.
I'm seeing a loving family.
I'm seeing friends who will do anything to help each other.
You know what I'm seeing?
I'm seeing my children playing the part of my children.
Nice.
Sweet.
- Not insane.
- It's been done.
Yeah, but not by us.
Hey, I'm proud of who we are.
And unless you wanna show people the real Tanner family I'm just gonna have to direct this thing myself.
Well, if you're gonna direct, what am I gonna do?
Oh, it's quite simple, Ronnie.
You will hold the cue cards.
- Quiet, everybody.
It's on.
Watch this.
- Okay.
Hello.
I'm Danny Tanner.
I do the sports for Channel 8 Newsbeat.
Every day at 4, 6 and 10 you invite me into your home and make me a part of your family.
Well, I'd like to introduce you to my family.
Follow me.
Like you have a choice.
Come on.
Don't be afraid.
Meet my stairs.
My loafers, my socks, my slacks.
Right this way.
Oh, there you are.
Golly.
- Hi, girls.
Daddy's home.
- Hi, Dad.
This happens every night, I swear.
This is my daughter D.J., and this is Stephanie.
Look, girls, Dad brought home a camera crew.
We know, Dad.
Yeah, Daddy.
You came up here five minutes ago and told us.
Honesty.
I teach my girls honesty.
Watch my dad do the sports, weeknights on Channel 8.
At 4, 6 and 10.
- Don't miss him.
- Don't miss him.
Marketing.
I also teach them marketing.
This way.
Boy, you move fast.
This is my other little girl Michelle.
Not this one, this one.
Is she ready?
Is she ready?
Are you ready, Michelle?
You ready?
Huh?
Okay, let's do a "La Bamba" thing for the Bay Area, all right?
Ready?
La Bamba These guys are also part of my family.
See, I'm a single parent, and they help me take care of my kids.
This is my brother-in-law, Jesse.
He has a rock band called Jesse Cochran and the Rippers.
Hi, Mom.
And this is my good friend Joey Gladstone.
Joey's a standup comic.
And, of course, I'm much funnier than I am right now.
Yes, Michelle.
Say, "Hi, San Francisco".
Hi, San Francisco.
Please watch my daddy.
He needs the work.
I outgrow my clothes every four months.
Honesty, marketing and begging for ratings.
Welcome to my world.
This is Danny Tanner, Channel 8 Action Sports.
Dad, can I have a raise in allowance?
You'd like to see that, wouldn't you, folks?
Kids.
God love them.
Write letters!
All right!
To be perfectly honest, it needed a poodle.
You guys were great.
Does that mean I get the raise in allowance?
Let's wait and see how many letters we get.
- I bet you we get 18 tomorrow.
- Stephanie!
Oops.
Okay, everybody who wants a sugar rush - to the kitchen for ice-cream sundaes.
- All right!
- Make a nice banana split, relax.
- Yeah, you bet.
Aha!
SeÃ±or Ferret returns.
He's making you look real bad.
This time he is mine.
Come here, buddy.
Come here.
Hey, remember our deal: a condo, a mink and Club Med.
Got him!
Just as I suspected.
A North American silver-footed ferret.
Two and a half pounds.
Adult male.
Joey, he's a pest and he's a varmint.
And the only way to dispose of this menace is.
I'm gonna take him to Big Sur and let him go free.
Oh, you big lug.
Your heart's as big as your hair.
Let's take him in the kitchen.
Show the girls there's no monsters, all right?
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to introduce America's newest superstar our own mini Meryl Streep, Miss Donna Jo Tanner!
Beautiful.
Thank you, thank you.
What an afternoon of theater.
D.J. as the beautiful princess in The Frog Prince.
I laughed, I cried, I learned about life.
I wish I didn't miss the ending.
Michelle, why did you start crying?
Because she was so moved by D.J.'s performance.
Or she had gas.
- D.J., do it again for Joey.
- Yeah, could you please, Deej?
I'd love to, but I need a frog.
What, do I look like a frog?
- Just checking.
- Okay, let's do it.
- Chairs.
- Guys, get a front-row seat.
Okay, Jesse, get on the floor and try to act like a frog.
How's this?
I just wanna dip your legs in garlic butter.
Oh, frog, why does the world force us to meet in secret?
Do not all of God's creatures share the heart that feels pain love, joy and sorrow?
If my true love is a frog, then so be it.
- My princess!
- My prince!
Thank you.
Thank you.
The girl is hot.
This acting thing is so cool.
Hey, Daniel, you've got a major talent here.
You know people in show biz.
Make some calls.
Maybe she can audition for, like, a commercial.
Great idea, Uncle Jesse!
Oh, yeah, great idea, Uncle Jesse.
D.J., honey, I'll ask around, but don't get your hopes up too high, okay?
I understand, Dad.
Whatever happens, happens.
But I hope it happens this week.
If I kiss you, will you turn back into a frog?
Michelle, you gotta be sick of all that strained baby grub they give you here.
Here.
Here's a corned-beef sandwich on rye with a big, fat, kosher pickle.
Now, what do you want on the side?
Potato salad or coleslaw?
- Just the pickle?
Okay.
- Hey, Jesse.
Hey, Michelle.
Jesse.
Why is Michelle eating a pickle and a corned-beef sandwich?
Because I didn't have time to make buffalo chicken wings.
- I'll take that, thank you.
- Hey, Jess, Danny, Michelle.
You did some shopping.
Very nice.
Hey, do you want a corned-beef sandwich on rye?
No, thank you.
You don't want a corned-beef sandwich on rye?
It's extra fatty.
No, thanks.
Why would I want that when I have meatless vegetable cutlets marinated tofu squares salt-free rice crackers?
What'd you do, win a Hare Krishna-family publisher sweepstakes?
Isn't that the one with Ed McMahon in the orange robe and the shaved head?
Hey, you guys can make fun of my food all you want.
I got some test results back from my doctor.
He said my cholesterol is high, but there's nothing to worry about.
All's I have to do is start exercising a little more.
- Exercise is good for you, Joseph.
- Eat less saturated fats.
- No fats.
- Good.
Keep you slim.
And I've decided to completely give up junk food.
- What, you guys don't think I can do it?
- Good sandwich.
Mighty good sandwich.
You are talking to Mr. Willpower, dudes.
It just so happens I gave up smoking like that.
Joey, I've known you forever.
When did you smoke?
When I was 12.
I smoked four cigarettes, my dad caught me, and I stopped cold turkey.
Okay.
Back to my life.
Look, guys, I called up a casting director as someone so thoughtfully suggested right in front of D.J. Thanks, frog boy.
Anyway, it turns out there's an audition next week for some cereal commercial.
I don't even know if I should tell D.J. Daniel, in life, when something comes along, you must grab it.
D.J.'s going for it.
- Wrong yet one more time.
- What?
D.J. will get all excited, she'll get beat out by some professional kiddie actor and she'll feel like a loser.
Don't put her through it.
- Go for it.
- Don't put her through it.
This is the hard part about being a parent.
Every decision could drastically alter the lives of my children forever.
- Joey's right.
Don't put her through it.
- Jesse's right.
She should go for it.
I don't know what I'm talking about, and there's no one here that can say I do.
Maybe I should talk this over with D.J. instead of Gomer and Goober.
- If you think that's best.
- Yeah.
You're the dad.
- Feed my kid, please.
- All right.
Feed the kid, Gomer.
Okay, Goob.
Jess, think about it.
Every decision we make could possibly affect these girls for the rest of their lives.
What should we feed Michelle?
Strained broccoli or strained peas?
Don't ask me.
Michelle, it's up to you.
Now, remember, that's your decision.
Hi, honey.
Homework?
Yeah.
We're learning about the Bill of Rights.
Does freedom of speech mean I can say anything I want around the house?
Sure, but don't forget, I have freedom of: "Say that again, and you're grounded".
Look, D.J., there's-- D.J. D.J., there's something I want you to think about very carefully.
I called a casting director and there's an audition next week for a cereal commercial.
Great!
I wanna do it!
Honey, you realize the chances of getting this job are very, very tiny.
Microscopic.
I wanna do it.
If you do this, it should be for fun.
I don't want you to feel disappointed if you don't get it.
Listen to me, Dad.
I want to do it.
I understand you want to do it.
But will you consider this before you make your decision?
- Sure, Dad.
- Okay.
I wanna do it!
Okay, this is it, girls.
They all look so professional.
- Very nice audition, Karen.
- Thank you so much, Vivian.
It felt good for me too.
Why don't I leave you my new picture and resume.
Well, I hope I'll be hearing from you soon.
Was that a little kid or a tiny grownup?
Steph, why don't you go over there and do some coloring, okay?
Uncle Jesse, this was a mistake.
I don't have a picture.
I don't have a resume.
All I did was kiss a frog.
All right.
I'll take care of this for you, all right?
May I call you Viv?
Hi, Viv.
Listen, I'd like to introduce to you a very talented young actress Miss Donna Jo Tanner.
Look at that face.
Nice face.
Just sign in and leave your picture and resume at the desk.
- But I don't have a picture.
- Yes, you do!
Right here.
I didn't have time to make hair.
Hey, moms and dads, come real close to the set.
Send all the kids out of the room.
Are they gone?
Good.
I've got a secret.
Oat boats are chocked full of vitamins and minerals.
But don't let your kids know.
They'll eat them anyways because they taste so great.
Yeah, Oat Boats!
Now, remember, this is our little secret.
If the word gets out, I'll deny everything.
Oh, beautiful!
That was great.
That was so-- - I'm sorry.
I was touched.
I was moved.
- Kids will love her.
I do.
So do I. You were terrific.
I want you to stay and do it again for Mr. Benton.
- He makes the final decision.
- Yes, yes, yes!
I mean, very well.
Excuse me.
Do I have time to do my hair before Mr. Benton gets here?
- Sure, no problem.
- I gotta go put some change in the meter.
- Steph, you stay right here and be good.
- Yeah.
Yes!
Miss Vivian, can I please have a little cereal?
D.J. was so good, she made me wanna eat some.
- Knock yourself out.
- Thanks.
I love Oat Boat races.
It's the strawberry against the banana!
And they're off!
It's the banana!
It's the strawberry!
And the banana wins.
First prize is a trip to my mouth.
I love it!
I didn't think we were gonna go this young but this little girl is adorable.
Vivian, you've done it again.
Well, Mr. Benton, sometimes you just have to go with your instincts.
Congratulations, young lady, you're the new Oat Boat girl.
- What?
- What?
What?
Well, here we go.
Some of my special seaweed-protein wheat-germ tonic.
Cholesterol-free.
- D.J. - Hey, Deej.
Something tells me things didn't go so great at the audition, did they?
Oh, no.
We talked about how this might happen.
They probably just gave the part to somebody's relative.
Oh, yeah.
- Hello.
- I know.
D.J. didn't get the part.
Here's something you don't know: Steph did.
Stephanie got the part?
That's wonderful!
I'm really sorry.
But that's wonderful!
I'm really sorry.
How did this happen?
If I said, "Hey, that's show biz," would that get me off the hook?
- No.
- Hey, cheer up, there's a bright side.
- What's that?
- I had nothing to do with it.
D.J., are you mad at me?
- Why would I be mad at you?
- Because I-- Oh, no reason.
I'm not mad.
I'm happy for you.
Way to go, Steph.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some homework to do.
- Is it okay to be happy?
- Of course it is, sweetheart.
I got it!
Stephanie, for your sister's sake, be happy a little quieter.
I got it.
Michelle, are you sure you don't want this?
Are you sure?
It's so juicy.
So meaty.
So saturated.
So what?
Joey, you in there?
Joey, we've been looking for you.
Where you been?
- What are you saying?
- What a beautiful baby.
Where did the small fry get the french fry?
Must have been there for weeks.
It's still warm.
And look at this.
Oh, my goodness, it looks as though Michelle has toddled up to the drive-through window again.
All right, I'm weak, I'm weak!
I'm not Mr. Willpower, I'm Mr. Cholesterol.
Joey.
You went from all junk food to all.
I don't know what the hell you've been eating.
There's another choice here.
Try moderation.
More fruit.
More fiber.
Less fat.
And we'll help out.
I'll start by helping you eat this burger and fries.
Thank you.
Come here, Michelle.
Guys, look, I gotta get back to the station, okay?
Listen to me.
This is real important.
Keep an eye on D.J. and Stephanie.
Right now, they're avoiding each other.
But I have a feeling that's only temporary, considering they share a bedroom.
- We'll take care of it.
- We got it.
Bye-bye, Michelle.
And please, don't ever go into acting.
"I love Oat Boats because Stephanie takes heaping spoonful of cereal.
They taste great.
She takes a bite".
Oh, I'm sorry.
Go ahead.
Rehearse.
"I love Oat Boats because Stephanie takes heaping spoon--" If I'm doing something wrong, will you help me?
You didn't need any help when you stole my part.
- Are you sure you're not mad at me?
- Don't be silly.
I'm glad I didn't get it.
You'll miss a lot of school doing that commercial.
- And they'll probably leave you back.
- I think you're jealous.
Me?
Jealous?
But I am hungry.
Fine.
You can have it.
Give me that right now!
- Give me it!
- No way, JosÃ©!
Give me it!
You're a thief!
- You're jealous!
- Thief!
- Jealous!
- Give me that, Stephanie Judith!
No, Donna Jo Margaret!
Why am I crawling?
- Hey, you guys.
- Ladies, ladies, ladies.
- She stole my cereal!
- She stole my part!
- Jealous!
- Thief!
Well, we got that all out of our systems.
Why don't you two just give each other a nice kiss and make up.
All right.
Come here, you.
Here.
You take your Oat Boats and go practice in the living room, okay?
- Stephanie Judith.
- Donna Jo Margaret.
Margaret?
D.J., why don't you wait downstairs, and we'll be down in a minute.
- But she-- - D.J. D.J., we need to talk.
Let me save you a lot of trouble.
You're right, I'm wrong, and I don't care.
Listen, D.J. Jesse and I strike out on auditions all the time.
Being a performer is basically a series of rejections occasionally interrupted by work.
Oh, yeah?
Well, did either of you have a part stolen by your little sister?
You know something?
She's r-- D.J., you're right.
Stephanie stole that part right out from under you.
In fact, she planned this whole thing.
She tricked us into bringing her along, pretending that she cares about you.
The conniving little sneak.
And then you fell into Stephanie's fiendish little trap by doing a great audition.
The monster.
Meanwhile, the sinister little Stephanie used her telekinetic powers to send us out of the room so she could steal your commercial.
I say we light some torches, find the she-devil and drive her into the night!
Okay, you guys were right.
She didn't do it on purpose.
But I'm still mad at her.
All right.
All right, kiddo.
I wanna know what's eating you.
All right, pal.
Come on, what's the matter?
Tell us.
I don't know.
I'm so sick of sisters.
Everything was just fine when it was just me.
And then Stephanie came along, and everyone said she was so cute.
Now everyone says Michelle is so cute.
It's so disgusting.
Was it so disgusting when you did the play and everyone thought you were so cute?
No, that was fine.
Until one of the so-cute sisters ruined everything again.
Buddy.
It's tough being the oldest.
But you can't overlook the benefits.
I mean, you get everything new.
No hand-me-downs.
- And you get to do everything first.
- That's right.
Date.
Drive.
You're the first to be admitted to an R-rated picture.
Without a parent or legal guardian.
But the best part is you got two little sisters who need you and look up to you and love you very, very much.
So, what do you think?
Should we light the torches find the beast and drive her into the darkness?
I guess not.
But if we did, I'd still have one little sister left.
- Noogie!
- Double noogie!
Hello, information?
I need to talk to Mr. Boat.
Mr. Oat Boat.
I need to talk to Mr. Boat.
I can't do his commercial.
His cereal is tearing my family apart.
Steph, I need to talk to you.
My sister's here.
Can I put you on hold?
Hello?
Hello?
How rude.
- I'm sorry I stole your part.
- You didn't steal it on purpose.
You didn't know what you were doing.
That's true.
I never know what I'm doing.
But you were right about one thing.
I was a little jealous.
That's okay.
I'm always jealous of you.
Really?
That's why I follow you around and bug you.
I think you're the smartest, prettiest, funnest girl I know.
Except when you hate me.
I don't hate you.
I was just mad at you.
And someday I'll probably be mad at you again.
Can you tell me when, so I can go visit Grandma?
That was funny, Steph.
I know the rule is you have to love your little sister but even if you were some strange little kid who lived in my room I'd love you anyways.
You're my best friend.
- Really?
I'm your best friend?
- Yep.
That works out great, because you're mine.
But do we really need Michelle?
Yeah.
You'll like her better when she's old enough to push around.
- Now, let's work on that script.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Ladies first.
Now, where it says here, "Stephanie takes heaping spoonful" you don't need to say that, you just do it.
No!
- Yeah.
- Wow, this acting is tough.
I wonder if Yogi Bear had this kind of trouble.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
The Channel 8 Action News at 4 will be right back with Danny Tanner and all the sports.
You'll see grunting, sweat, and when I'm done doing that I'll read the scores.
- We've gone to commercial.
- Great, thank you.
Robin, hi.
How did your interview go?
Wait, don't tell me.
Mr. Morton loved you and you're our new reporter.
And if you are, are you making more money than me?
Yeah, right.
My first reporting job, making more money than you?
I haven't even met Mr. Morton, he's still at lunch.
He is gonna love you.
It'll be so great to have you here.
Unless you make more money than me.
Tanner.
Warriors just made a trade.
- I'll be right there.
- Let's move it.
In a second, Derrick.
- Come over for dinner tonight.
- Great.
I'll check into my hotel-- Hotel?
For my old pal Robin?
You are checking in at the Tanner Hilton.
I'll put a new paper strip over the toilet, you'll be all set.
Tanner, move, move, move!
Derrick, do you need me for something?
Have mercy.
Michelle, look at her.
She's beautiful.
All right, kid, do your thing.
All right, Michelle beam her in.
She is so adorable.
Here she comes, Michelle.
You're better than a Ferrari.
Hi there, little angel.
- Hello.
- Hello.
I was just thinking that this has to be the cutest little baby I've ever seen.
Oh, you think she's cute now, watch this.
- Go ahead, try it.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, go.
- Okay.
I think my niece Michelle really likes you.
It's a pleasure to meet you, Michelle.
I'm Robin Winslow.
Michelle wants you to know my name's Jesse Cochran.
What, Michelle?
Excuse me.
I know this is kind of embarrassing, and we just met and all but Michelle thinks that maybe the three of us should get together for an evening of dinner and dancing.
Oh, well, listen, I've gotta get settled in tonight.
But if tomorrow night's good, how about maybe the three of us meet here around 6.
Darn.
Michelle's got tickets to the opera tomorrow night.
But I suppose you and I could still go out.
Well, only if it's all right with Michelle.
Oh, it's fine-- Let me ask.
Is it okay, Michelle?
Is it okay?
Michelle says it's okay.
So should we seal it with a kiss?
For Michelle, of course.
- Of course.
- Michelle, give her a kiss.
Michelle thinks you have beautiful eyes.
I think Michelle's been hanging around too many singles bars.
Bye, Michelle.
Bye, Jesse.
What a team.
Stand by.
On the air in 15 seconds.
I've got an audition, and Joey's running the girls around town - so you have to take Michelle.
- Yeah, but I-- And now, here with all the sports, our very own Danny Tanner.
Hello.
I'd like to introduce a new addition to the sports segment.
My daughter Michelle.
Michelle is here to pick tonight's NBA winners.
Okay, honey, who do you think is gonna win?
Do you think the Warriors can beat the Nuggets tonight?
Yes, Michelle picks the Warriors.
By how many points, honey?
Five points.
Yes, see that?
One point, maybe.
One point.
Five points.
Thank you, Michelle the Greek.
D.J., I remember you when you were that big.
- Do you remember me at all?
- Sure I do.
You were the one who looked like you.
Right.
It's okay Deej, you were only 5.
I'm only 5.
Does that mean I'm gonna forget all this?
Probably.
I should be taking notes.
Now, Michelle, if anyone asks you, I made this dinner completely by myself.
You never saw these takeout cartons.
- But I see them.
- Hi.
Joey, Joey, Joey.
Steph, I'm tired of getting a hard time because I'm not the world's greatest cook.
Don't worry, Joey, I'm not the world's greatest anything.
Now, that is not true.
You are the world's greatest Stephanie, and that's a lot.
Thanks, Joey, and don't worry, I'll keep your secret.
But watch her, she's a blabbermouth.
Okay.
Why don't you go tell everyone I'm almost through cooking.
All right.
Thank you.
I'll just get rid of the evidence.
- Hi, Joey.
- Hi, Jill.
Yeah, I am just cooking up a storm here.
- Is Jesse home yet?
- Jill, are you dating Jesse again?
Well, we never really stopped.
If we don't have a date with anybody else, we have a date with each other.
Unbelievable.
Even when he doesn't have a date, he has a date.
Go on, get out of here.
- Hello, everybody.
- Jesse.
Robin, meet my brother-in-law, Jesse.
Jesse, this is Robin.
She was a news writer at my first station.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Any day now, they'll get to "nice to meet you".
- Going out tomorrow, right?
- Absolutely.
Boy, does he work fast.
We met at the station.
I hope you don't mind, but I invited Robin to stay here this weekend and I thought she could stay in your room.
God bless you.
- That means you'll be moving in with-- - No, no, no.
Don't say it.
Please don't say the J word.
Come on, soup's on.
Plenty of grub for everybody.
Get them doggies rolling.
Go on, grab a beef hoof, Danny.
Go on.
- Hi, roomie.
- Hi, Jesse.
Hi, Jill.
Hi, Jill-- - Hi, Jill.
- Didn't forget our date tonight, did you?
No, I didn't forget.
Of course not.
We're going right now.
Let's go get something to eat, shall we?
Wait, don't go out, I spent hours cooking a delicious Chinese meal.
Yum.
I love Chinese.
I better check on my egg rolls.
You better protect your egg rolls.
Have a seat, roomie.
So, Robin, this is my friend Jill.
Jill, this is my other friend Robin.
Yes, friends meeting friends having a nice friendly dinner of friendship, if you will.
Jill and I have met, but it's nice to meet you again.
In fact, Jill was telling me that you two have a date tonight.
Yeah, could you believe he got off this cheap?
But he's so cute how could you not love him?
So let's see what Joseph's cooked up for us tonight, shall we?
Look at this food.
- Joey, this smells great.
- It is, it's good.
Thank you, I guess that's the last we'll hear about Joey being a bad cook.
You know, it tastes a little like the Io mein at Uncle Wu's Chinese Palace.
- Yes, it does.
- Except it's much better.
Thank you, Stephanie.
So, sweetie, what movie should we see tonight?
We'll decide on the way.
- So, D.J., how was your day at school?
- Fine.
- How was your day at school today?
- Fine.
Normally, you can't shut them up.
Daniel, you have an exciting career, how was your day at work?
Fine.
This food is yum.
You know, Jesse and I met in a Chinese restaurant.
I don't think they wanna hear about that, Jill.
- Oh, I'd love to.
- Now she talks.
Well, Jesse came in to pick up a takeout order with baby Michelle.
There's something about a man with a baby that's so sexy and so hard to resist.
Oh, it's becoming easier.
You use my baby to meet women?
Michelle, tomorrow you're coming with me to the market.
Once Jesse got me to kiss the baby I was hooked.
Really?
Did you blow on her tummy too?
Yeah, the first time I met her.
How did you know?
Just some crazy hunch.
Uncle Jesse, is the food too spicy for you?
- No, why?
- Because you're sweating bullets.
Turning to local news, substantial rainfall on key northern watersheds has eliminated-- - Hello, hello.
- Hey, Jess.
- Hope I'm not interrupting.
- Oh, not at all.
Robin and I were working on her audition.
Great.
This will just take a few minutes, I need to talk to Robin privately.
- Sounds like my cue.
- No, Danny, don't go.
Jesse, if this is about Jill, there's nothing to explain.
There is.
I want you to know there's nothing between us.
We just met.
There is no reason why you should feel bad about having a date tonight.
So we're still going out tomorrow night?
I've been thinking about this, and it's probably not a good idea.
I should be focusing on my career.
Did I hear you say you're breaking our date?
- Did I just hear Michelle?
- Danny, don't go.
Yes.
Jesse, I'm sorry, but I am.
I'm breaking our date.
- No.
- Yes.
- No.
- Yes.
Jesse, she's breaking the date.
- No.
- Yes.
Truth is, seeing you and Jill together made me realize - I've been out with you before.
- Not in this life.
Oh, I-- In a past life, we doubled with Shirley MacLaine and King Tut, right?
Okay, that was very cute.
I'm cute.
You think I'm cute now, I am adorable on a date.
Tell her.
He's a fox.
What I meant is, I've been out with your type before - and it always gets me into trouble.
- Oh, I'm a type?
- I'm sure there's someplace I have to be.
- Sit down!
You don't wanna miss this, she's about to tell me about my type.
Go ahead, type away.
All right.
I'll tell you exactly what your type is.
You're the guitar-playing, leather-wearing, Elvis-loving motorcycle-riding, girl-chasing, blow-drying baby-toting, tough-guy type.
How's that?
Lucky guess.
- But you got me.
- Yeah.
You got me on that one.
Robin, sit down.
See, I'm other types too.
I'm the romantic type.
I'm the compassionate type.
I'm the type that's attracted to your type.
Really?
Is anyone aware of the fact that I'm still in the room?
- Excuse me.
- Danny, don't you dare leave now.
Jesse, there's one more thing about your type.
I bet you haven't had a relationship last more than three months.
- Am I right or am I right?
- Wrong.
- Wrong?
- Wrong.
I was in love with this girl.
- Sharon.
- Edwards.
Edwards.
Sharon Edwards.
I was madly in love with Sharon for four beautiful months.
I remember.
Didn't she spend two of those beautiful months in Europe?
Get out!
Get out.
Get out of here.
Yes, I can leave now.
I'm off now to patch up that pesky Iran-Iraq squabble.
The truth?
I'm afraid of getting hurt again.
Guys like you and I, we never work out, because we're totally different people.
Yes, but, Robin, that's the exciting part.
That's the beauty of this.
We're like fire and ice, you and me.
Do you know what you get with fire and ice?
Yeah, steam.
A puddle.
- Good night, Jesse.
- I'm not taking no for an answer.
I'm not going out with you.
Thanks for your room.
- You're kicking me out of my room?
- I am.
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.
And don't touch any of my records!
Hi.
We were just - talking and-- - It's none of our business.
We were all just passing in the hall at the exact same time.
Uncle Jesse, you really like her, huh?
No, I don't like her.
I'll admit, at first, there was a wee bit of an attraction.
Yes, I really like her.
This is the worst breakup ever in my whole entire life.
And I haven't even been out with her yet.
Fellas, look, I'm all right.
It's over, her loss, I'm moving on.
You can't fool your roomie.
Joseph, why don't you believe me?
Because you were up the whole night singing "Heartbreak Hotel" in your sleep.
Jesse, you always rush into everything.
Why don't you just slow down, let her get to know you, be her friend first.
Friends are what you're forced to become after you break up.
Look, guys, it doesn't matter, okay?
I'm fine.
Oh, yeah?
Is that why just you served me the leaning tower of french toast?
You look thin.
Oh, and I suppose I'm King Kong Bundy?
You're getting so pretty.
Can I help you with your nails?
Sure, D.J, just try to stay above the cuticles, okay?
Are there any other parts on your body that I can help with?
Would you like to brush my hair?
All right!
Much better than nails.
When you get the job and move here, you can come visit us all the time.
And date Uncle Jesse.
I'd love to see the two of you but I wouldn't count on me dating your uncle.
You know David and Maddie on Moonlighting didn't like each other at first either.
Uncle Jesse's a great catch.
- He can sing.
- And he gives fun piggyback rides.
He's got an awesome head of hair.
And he teaches you to ride a two-wheeler without training wheels.
As long as you don't ride in the street.
Now, you two are so sweet.
I only hope someday I have nieces just like you.
Marry Uncle Jesse, and you will.
- Good morning, girls.
- Morning.
- Hi, Robin.
- Good morning, Jesse.
I'll give you a ride to school on my bikemobile.
- Shotgun.
- No fair, I gotta get my milk money.
Okay, hurry up, I'll wait for you.
What, what, what?
Let me see.
Let me see.
Let me see.
You're in luck.
It just so happens that I went to finger college, okay?
Now, in order to treat your finger, I gotta know what color the pain is.
You have to close your eyes, put your finger on your nose that way, we can tell what color the pain is.
Do it.
I'm the finger doctor.
Very good.
Now, what color is the pain?
- It's kind of green.
- It's kind of green?
Any other colors?
How about polka dots?
Yeah, there's polka dots.
- Blue ones.
- Blue ones.
Any stripes?
- No stripes.
- Oh, good.
That's good because stripes are dangerous.
All right, this is easy to diagnose.
Nine out of 10 doctors will agree that we can solve the pain by opening your eyes and taking your finger off your nose.
It's gone.
Thanks, Uncle Jesse.
All right, no charge.
We'll put it on your father's medical insurance.
You're wasting your time killing bugs.
Come on, I'll give you a piggyback ride.
Here we go, here we go, here we go.
Up!
Good luck today.
What a guy, huh?
And there were no fights in hockey today.
Finally, Michelle would like to thank all of you for your calls asking her to be a regular on the 4:00 sports.
Yesterday, Michelle picked the Warriors by five, and son of a gun.
Son of a gun if they didn't win 106 to 101.
But I'm afraid Michelle is retiring as oddsmaker that's right, to resume her former career of eating, learning to talk and burping.
Well, that's sports.
This is Danny and Michelle Tanner saying bye-bye, and bye-bye.
So long, San Francisco.
Until 6, see you then.
- We're off the air.
- Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.
Thanks for picking up Michelle.
No problem.
Everybody has a purpose in life.
Mine is chauffeuring around little babies.
- Keep up the good work.
- Okay.
Substantial rainfall in key watersheds has eliminated the threat of cutbacks in water deliveries next year to municipal and industrial users in California.
- Now, what does this--?
- Hi.
Hi.
What is it, Jesse?
Michelle was just saying how interesting it was.
Don't do that Michelle business, please.
You didn't like it, be honest.
How do I say this without hurting your feelings?
- It put me to sleep.
- That's not how you'd say it.
You-- You have something special inside you.
You gotta let it out.
You gotta show some energy.
Auditions scare me to death.
You have to have fun, you know?
You have to have fun, like the kid.
You can't be afraid to get crazy.
Let me show you.
Let me show you what I'm talking about.
Here, hold the baby.
Come here.
It's gotta be something like this.
Okay.
Hello, San Francisco.
How the heck are you?
Jesse Cochran here, For the Channel Ocho News.
Today's top story is wet and wild.
Get this: There has been substantial rainfall in key northern watersheds.
What's that mean?
No more having to beg for water in restaurants take longer showers, wash your car every day.
And, hey, yank that brick out of the toilet, huh?
San Francisco, the good life is back.
We've got water coming out our ears!
Municipal and industrial users in Northern California, have mercy.
See?
That's it.
You gotta laugh, you gotta smile.
You have to put that into your audition.
We gotta beef up security in here.
Miss Winslow, you're on.
She's beautiful, she's intelligent, she's charming everything I want in a newswoman.
Ladies and gentlemen, may I present Miss Robin Winslow!
Give me the kid.
Thank you, young man.
Whoever he was, I. Hello, San Francisco.
This is Robin Winslow, Channel 8 News.
Substantial rainfall in key northern watersheds has.
To Robin, Channel 8's newest field reporter.
- All right.
- All right.
And to all of you, for all of your help.
Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- What did you do?
I don't know.
But when somebody says "thank you" you're supposed to say "you're welcome".
- Jesse, can I have a word with you?
- Sure.
Will you excuse us?
You're excused.
I love being polite.
I just wanted to thank you for all your help.
Hey, I'm happy to do it.
Which part helped you out the most?
Oh, I'd have to say it was your insane newscast.
It was so awful, it made me looked terrific.
And it's all part of my plan.
I was wrong about you.
You're different than all the other "yous" I've dated, but you know what I like most?
Let's see, how about my love for adventure?
The way I live my life on the edge?
Your strong maternal instincts.
The words I've been dying to hear from a woman.
Oh, boy, how did this happen?
I never used to like kids until I talked to one.
Well, you've got a terrific family here.
Those girls really adore you.
And I'm beginning to see why.
Listen, Robin, I'm not the type of guy that just rushes into relationships, okay?
I think you and I should become friends.
- I'd like that.
- Good.
- So we'll just be friends, period.
- You got it, buddy.
All right, pal.
But listen, if you wanna go beyond this friendship thing you'll have to make the first move because it won't be me.
I understand that.
Let's get back to the party.
Come on.
Robin, I'm curious.
If you did happen to make that first move, what would it be?
I mean, I would hate to miss it.
Trust me, if I made a move, you'd know it.
- Okay, pal?
- Okay, little buddy.
- Was that a move?
- Did your toes curl?
Yeah, does that mean you're making a move?
No, when I make a move everything curls.
Have mercy.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
One, two, one, two, three.
All right!
One more time!
Hey, if we were all in the shower, you'd be begging for more.
I'd be begging to get out.
All right, guys.
Very good.
I'll see you at dress rehearsal tonight.
Goodbye.
- Goodbye - Goodbye, fellas.
- Goodbye - Very nice, guys.
Goodbye, goodbye Good - All right, see you at dress rehearsal-- - Bye - Goodbye!
- Goodbye!
Steph?
Stephanie, honey, are you okay?
I feel yucky.
Honey, let's see if you feel any better if I move you over to the couch, okay?
Here you go.
There you are.
Now how do you feel, honey?
I still feel yucky.
Let me check your forehead.
I think she feels a little warm.
Let me see that.
Here, let me see that.
Let me see.
Let me see that.
Check that one too.
I think they're all running a fever.
She's really got a fever.
Look at her, she's sweating.
Can I ask a question?
Aren't I too young to get pimples?
Stephanie, those aren't pimples.
I think they're chickenpox.
Chickenpox?
I caught something from a chicken?
No, you probably caught this from somebody at school.
Don't worry, you're gonna be fine.
Everybody gets chickenpox.
- I had them.
- I had them.
- I had them too.
- I never had them and I never will.
I'm immune to chickenpox.
You can't be immune to chickenpox.
Every kid in my school had them but me.
When you're an awesome physical specimen like my own bad self.
Germs take one look at my body and say: "Hey, why waste our time"?
Women say the same thing.
That's right.
Okay, so I guess nobody here has to worry about catching chickenpox.
Oh, my god.
I got her.
Daddy, I'm itching, I'm itching.
Sweetheart, remember what the doctor said, "No scratching".
How am I supposed to scratch with these on my hands?
Honey, those help take away the itch.
They're magic oven mitts.
Dad, get real.
They're for TV dinners.
Any second, Uncle Jesse will be up here with something to help stop the itching.
It better help.
I gotta be all better by tomorrow.
That's when a real ballerina is coming to dance for my ballet class.
I know, but if you want to be better, you gotta get rest and drink plenty of fluids.
Rest.
Fluids.
Got it.
Hey, Steph.
Here's your juice.
Keep them coming, D.J.
This time, orange juice but no pulp.
Wait till you get better.
All right, I found the calamine lotion.
- How do I look?
- Like you should be spinning from the ceiling of a disco.
Steph, I found something that'll suck the itch right out.
Sit over here.
Here, take care of this.
- Thanks, Jesse.
- I'll lift the shirt.
- Hurry up!
It's still itching!
- All right.
- I hate this!
- Get up here.
Let me tell you, when I had the chickenpox I never scratched them once.
And you know why?
I haven't the slightest idea.
Because I got tough.
Now, let me hear you be tough.
Nice try.
Growling?
Please.
Steph, what you need is state-of-the-art medical technology.
I give you Teddy Itch-No-More.
I'll try anything!
Wait, let me show you how he works first.
- Okay, where does it itch the most?
- My tummy.
Okay, scratch Teddy Itch-No-More on his tummy.
Yeah, now we're in business.
But wait.
You also get this special bonus gift.
Something to let us know when you need us.
- Oh, no.
- You didn't.
- Thanks, Joey.
- Yeah, thanks, Joey.
That's very nice.
Always thinking.
Here.
This ought to hold you for five minutes.
I hope so.
Okay, sweetheart.
Get in bed.
Now, I'll be here with you all weekend except for tomorrow afternoon when I have to finish my special report on the Golden State Warriors.
Thanks.
Your father is actually gonna put on a uniform warm up with the team and sit on the bench during a real game.
- Good for you.
- All right.
And if eight players get hurt and a peanut vendor, I'm in.
I got my dress rehearsal tonight, my doo-wop show tomorrow night but other than that, I'm yours.
And I'm available all weekend because unfortunately, I'm available all weekend.
Great, because I'm out of here.
I'm going to Sally Penzo's house for my very first slumber party.
I'm so nervous.
I'm in charge of making sure nobody falls asleep.
I don't mean to be rude, but I gotta get some rest.
Out, out, out.
She's really too cute to be your kid.
- What?
- What is it, honey?
Just testing.
Well, it works.
Dad, do I really have to sleep in the nursery?
It's way too cute in here.
Stephanie needs her rest.
D.J., are you telling me you aren't thrilled to death to share a room with this little bundle of baby fun?
Well, that's not fair.
Good night, D.J. And good night, Michelle.
Something tells me I ought to check on Stephanie.
And kill Joey.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Okay, Michelle.
How many people think Michelle should go to sleep?
I do.
One to nothing.
I win.
Well, night-night, Michelle.
Sleep tight.
No, Michelle.
This is not a slumber party.
Now, you need some sleep.
Lie down.
Now, Michelle, I mean it.
Go to sleep.
No bye-bye.
Night-night.
Sit.
Lie down.
This is a good finger.
D.J., check this out.
Maybe if I hold the ball still and I spin I'll actually create the illusion that I can do this.
D.J., hey, slow down.
You're not supposed to chugalug your cereal.
Sorry, they're picking me up in two minutes for my first slumber party.
I understand, but do you also want your very first Heimlich maneuver?
Morning.
Oh, nice look, Jesse.
Did your blow dryer short out?
- Oh, Jesse, what's wrong with you?
- Nothing.
I'm fine.
Really I'm fine.
Morning, Joey.
I got a fever, I'm sweaty, I'm chilly.
Obviously, it's malaria.
Look at all these mosquito bites.
Those aren't mosquito bites.
Those are chickenpox.
That's impossible.
I'm immune.
You're immune to common sense.
Face it, you got the chickenpox.
Okay, but as soon as I'm over this, I'm immune.
Hello!
Oh, hello, Mother.
How's Palm Springs?
Oh, yeah, fine.
Everything's fine here.
Except Stephanie and Joey have the chickenpox.
What are you talking about?
Mother, I had the chickenpox.
Remember how tough I was?
It was an allergic reaction to wool?
But I was still tough.
Yes, I know.
Fluids.
Lots of rest.
No dating.
Goodbye, Mother.
I'm in trouble.
The station is counting on me to be with the Warriors and I got two babysitters who can't go near the baby.
I've gotta find a sitter.
Well, gotta go.
I'll be right there.
You'll be fine, won't you, Dad?
Oh, honey, I'll be fine.
Don't worry about me.
I'll just start calling around.
There's gotta be at least 20 sitters in here just dying to make $1.50 an hour.
Honey, you go.
You go slumber party hearty.
Dad, that was almost hip.
You sure you'll be okay?
- Oh, I'm positive.
Go, go, go.
- Okay.
Bye.
Great.
I've got 47 minutes to find a sitter.
Guys, I may be almost hip, but I am definitely in trouble.
Guys?
Guys.
Goodbye, chickenpox prison.
Hello, ballerina.
Yikes!
Where's my bacon, eggs, toast, juice and tea?
Danny, where are you?
On the phone, calling sitters.
All right, I'll give you a hand.
I'll write down exactly what I want.
Oh, where the heck is a pen when you need one?
Must be sicker than I thought.
Please, you can't replace me.
I've shot all the other footage.
I've done all the other interviews.
Derek, I'm already wearing the suit.
I look really cute.
Yes.
Don't worry, I'll be there.
Right.
Thirty-seven minutes.
Thirty-seven minutes?
- Danny.
- I'm coming!
I wish chickenpox caused laryngitis.
Gotta find a babysitter.
I'm history.
Freeze!
Well, well, well, what have we here?
Hello, Mr. Cochran.
And hello to you, little stranger.
Do I know you?
I'm my friend Karen.
I just came by to visit poor little Stephanie.
Oh, that's very considerate of you, Karen.
She's missing a real ballerina.
Well, why don't you go upstairs and say hi.
As you know, Stephanie's very sick with the chickenpox and shouldn't be going anywhere.
Chickenpox?
I better get out of here.
Not so fast, Karen.
It's too late.
Probably already got them from me.
Uncle Jesse, you have the chickenpox too?
What was that, Karen?
I mean, Mr. Uncle.
I mean, Uncle Cochran.
I mean, Jesse.
Mister.
I mean.
I. I. I can't take it anymore.
It's me.
It's me.
Stephanie.
Unbelievable.
Stephanie-- I could have sworn it was Lauren Bacall.
Now what are you doing out of bed, young lady?
I'm all better.
What are those bumps all over you?
Those are my all-better bumps.
I wish they were, kid, but we both know they're not.
- Now, come on.
- Be careful.
- My chickenpox.
- Right, yeah.
All right.
Now, Stephanie unfortunately, being sick sometimes means having to miss out on something that you really wanna do.
But the trick is, you gotta be tough like your Uncle Jesse.
Does this mean you don't care about missing your doo-wop show?
Oh, I gotta miss my doo-wop show.
Remember what you told me: Be tough.
Come on, kid.
I'll get you some P.J.s, all right?
Here we go.
The chicken-pock twins.
Get the strut down, get the chicken strut.
That's it.
Joseph, it's just not fair.
Who ever said life is fair?
Two grown men dabbing goop on their bodies, I call that unfair!
You think this is unfair?
Let's talk about salmon, shall we?
Salmon wait their whole lives to swim hundreds of miles upstream make love once and drop dead.
Now, that is unfair.
What the hell are you talking about?
I am talking about making the best of a situation.
Sure, I'm itching.
But I'm itching with a smile on my face.
Itch.
Dab.
Itch.
Dab.
Itch.
Dab, dab, dab.
You, my friend, are a wimp.
You think that because I itch, I'm a wimp?
No, there's quite a few other reasons, Joseph.
Let's just see who scratches first, shall we?
Fine.
That's a beaut up there on that forehead of yours.
- Yeah?
- Bet you'd love to take a rake to that baby.
Check out that red, throbbing strobe light on your nose.
Yeah.
Yeah, that one.
Yeah, if this were December, you'd find yourself pulling a sleigh full of toys.
You know, I was wondering - what I would look like with a beard.
- Scratching!
I was wondering!
You know, you got me wondering a little myself.
I'm feeling a little hefty.
Joseph, am I putting on any weight here?
- Scratching!
- I was wondering!
Just like you, wondering, wondering, wondering.
Even.
These clothes are killing me!
- You know, I got an idea.
- What?
If you scratch me and I scratch you, then we're both still tough guys, right?
Tough yet resourceful.
Get my back!
Get mine, get mine, get mine.
- Together.
Down.
- Up.
- Down.
- Up.
Shoulders, shoulders.
- Scratch my head.
- Thank you.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Hello, Mr. Zuckerman.
Hi, this is Danny Tanner.
Yeah, I desperately need a babysitter.
Is your daughter home?
Well, how about you?
Have you ever considered picking up a little extra change babysitting?
Hello?
Hello?
"Oh" is right.
That's it, Michelle.
The end of the list.
You have any luck?
Don't tease me like that.
I'm dead.
Unless I call up Sally Penzo's house and get ahold of D.J. before she goes to Carmel for the slumber party.
Yeah, then she could make it back in time, and I could get to my game.
Oh, but, Michelle, she's been looking forward to this for weeks.
It's her very first slumber party.
But then again, it's my very first Warriors game.
But if she misses that party, it's gonna break her heart.
What do you think, Michelle?
Should I call up D.J. or not?
Very tempting.
But I just can't do that to D.J.
We could still play, though.
Yeah, let's call each other.
Hello, Michelle.
Hi, it's Daddy.
You hung up on your father?
Here's some tuna fish and soup It's nutritious and delicious And it's great to fight infection For the family that I love - Joey?
- I'm not hungry.
- Jesse.
- Me neither.
- Steph?
- I'm nauseous.
Slide over.
I'm not going anywhere.
No sitter?
Just the one you're looking at.
I can't believe I'm gonna miss my game.
- Hi, everybody.
- D.J., you're back.
What are you doing here?
Wanted to make sure you had a babysitter.
Need one?
Yes.
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you.
- You better leave.
You're gonna be late.
- No, I might just make it now.
Is this a terrific kid or what?
You gave up your slumber party for me?
D.J., thank you, thank you, thank you.
Yeah, well, there'll be other parties.
Dad, you do so much for me.
This is my chance to do something nice for you.
Isn't that what being part of a family's all about?
Do you hear this?
- You really are growing up.
- It's not fun.
D.J., you're becoming very mature and responsible.
Yeah, and I guess having me for an uncle is starting to rub off on you, D.J. Uncle Jesse, you're delirious.
- If you're not leaving, I'm going back.
- I'm out of here.
I'm out of here.
I am just so honored to be part of this family.
Guys, we really are doing something right.
D.J., you are one terrific kid.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
- Dad, I'm leaving.
- I'm gone.
I'm gone.
Thank you, bye.
The man loves to hug.
You guys don't need anything, do you?
- Get my guitar.
- I'd like my coloring books - Get me orange juice.
- and some colors and paper dolls and some tissues and.
Bring my Rolling Stone down here.
Bring my phone book.
Get my phone book.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Now, let's try the A minor seventh chord, which is the first finger.
Okay, first fret-- Relax, relax.
First fret, third string.
There you go.
This finger goes there, that finger.
I almost have it.
If I only had one more finger.
All right, give it a try.
Let's hear it.
That was very good.
That-- That was very close to music.
Not close enough.
Kimmy, I swear, I'm gonna learn how to play this thing.
Now, don't forget, starting The Bracelets was my idea.
That's why it would be so tragic to have to replace you.
Kimmy, do me a favor.
Don't help.
All right, let's do the song "Venus".
Okay, you start it.
Go ahead, D.J. Go ahead.
Good.
That's-- That's very good.
Sing it, kid.
Oh, lay it down, child.
Burn it down to the ground.
This side is so much easier to play.
Let me try again.
All right.
That was beautiful.
Look, I'm sorry to cut this short, but tonight is Joey's big night.
Let's go.
D.J., maybe you should stay home tonight and practice.
In fact, you may have to drop out of school.
Kimmy, lighten up.
It's that kind of attitude that broke up the Go-Go's.
Danny, listen to this.
I got a new bit: Hello, Wilbur.
I'm gonna visit all my friends in prison.
- Mister Ed?
- Close.
Mister Ed Meese.
Joey, you are gonna be hot tonight.
It's finally gonna happen, Danny.
I can feel it.
Tonight is my night.
- There's gonna be a scout from HBO-- - From HBO who's looking for talented young comics for a big special.
You might have mentioned it once or twice or several hundred thousand times.
Got the kid packed up.
She can either spend the night at Grandma's or six months in Europe.
- Here.
- Thank you.
I'm sorry you're gonna miss this.
Okay, give me a kiss for good luck.
All right.
Well, this kills me, but I'll be supportive for a moment.
Joseph, you're a real funny guy.
And you're gonna do great tonight.
Time's up.
Well, thanks.
I'll be touched for a moment.
Time's up.
- All right.
Wish me luck, everybody.
- Good luck!
Tonight is my night.
Yes!
Well, we better get going too.
No, no, we can't go yet.
My date hasn't showed up yet.
I'm so nervous.
Good evening, Jess.
Hello, dear.
Sorry I kept you waiting.
May I say you look quite lovely this evening.
And may I say you look quite lovely yourself too, also.
Here you are.
What are you lugging around a purse for?
Because I have woman things I need on a date.
Money for a phone call keys to someplace and, of course, an orange.
- Shall we?
- Let's.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
They do make a lovely couple.
I'll get the panda.
The fire goes in the pan just like that.
And then, voilÃ¡!
A duck.
This guy's great.
And now the duck goes into the magic box, right over here.
No, no, no, it's not a microwave.
Thank you.
Then.
Oh, yeah!
- That's entertainment.
- What happened to the duck?
Thank you very much.
Good night!
Let's hear it for the amazing Ed Alonzo.
Come on.
We'll be right back after a short break with our very own Joey Gladstone.
This is every comic's dream, following a magician.
The audience is dying to laugh.
Don't look now, but the guy from HBO is sitting right behind you.
My bodyguards.
- Joey, break a leg.
- Break a leg?
Honey, that means "good luck".
Poke an eye out, Joey.
- That's my date, huh?
- Thanks, guys.
- Good luck.
- All right.
All right, we're back.
And it's time for Mr. Fun.
He's wacky.
He's zany.
As a matter of fact, we consider him family because he expects to get fed for free.
Wait a minute.
I know that laugh.
Is Phyllis--?
Is that Phyllis Diller?
Oh, I love you, Brucie.
Why don't you stand up and take a bow.
Oh, thank you.
I had no trouble getting up.
I've had things lifted so many times I rise automatically.
You think we can get her up here to tell a few jokes?
I can't.
I can't.
No, you can't, you can't.
This is my night.
- Please?
- Oh, what the heck.
I hate to see a grown man beg.
I take that back.
I love it.
Let's hear it.
Phyllis Diller!
Number one, I shouldn't have married Fang.
I found that out at the wedding.
He got down to the altar and asked for a blindfold and a cigarette.
Then he paid the organist 20 bucks to play "What Kind of Fool Am I"?
Then he tried to get my garter off over my head.
And he did.
He said the engagement ring was a square-cut emerald.
It was a Chiclet.
So I told Fang, "I did not lose the bumper.
It's in the back seat".
I can't believe I've been up here an hour.
Hour and a half.
I've gotta go.
I've got dinner reservations and my date is getting cold.
- You've been absolutely great.
- Let's hear it for Phyllis Diller!
What a treat!
Phyllis Diller, ladies and gentlemen.
Let's hear it.
No, no, wait, wait!
There's plenty more laughs!
I-- Anyway, you guys know what ticks me off more than anything else?
Have you guys seen the stuff they're giving away in cereal boxes?
Well, let's hear it for our own Joey Gladstone!
Thank you.
Thank you.
Aren't we lucky?
Of all nights, Phyllis Diller picked tonight to be at this club.
Remember when you were younger, how your mom always had the final word?
And she could always change any word she wanted into a verb.
It was kind of like, "Hey, Mom, can I have a cookie"?
"I'll cookie you".
Thanks a lot.
Hope your tractor starts.
I see some people here on dates tonight.
Why do you always take credit when your date gets compliments as if you had something to do with it?
It's like: "Your girlfriend's really a doll".
"Well, thanks.
I made her at home with my chemistry set".
Wait, would you like to hear some impressions?
Some current events?
Would you like to see my bridgework?
- Joey, you down here?
- I'm here.
We were worried.
We didn't hear you come in last night.
Good morning, all.
Is that you inside that suit?
Indeed it is.
He's been moussing.
Joey, you've never moussed.
Please, call me Joe.
It's more sophisticated more grown-uppy.
Excuse me, Joe.
- Is there a punch line to this?
- Oh, there's no punch line.
You see, last night was a revelation.
That big break is not coming.
I am going to venture into the business world.
I'm going to get a real job and make some real money.
I'm starting a whole new way of life.
But what about your comedy?
D.J., there comes a point in your life where you just have to say to yourself: "I tried and I failed".
I'm just glad I found this out now, and not when I'm 46 years old.
I am quitting comedy.
Lee Iacocca?
My man.
Boy, I'm glad I took off work today.
Otherwise, I would have missed a fascinating tour of every daycare center in the Northern Bay Area.
I know, but once Joey finds a job, we're gonna lose a babysitter.
We've gotta find a great place for Michelle.
We narrowed it down to your favorite 803.
- Okay, let's switch.
Here you go.
- Come here, Michelle.
Okay.
I liked this place.
"Piggly Wiggly's Fitness and Daycare Center specializing in toddlerobics".
Oh, look at this.
A complimentary sweatband.
- See how she likes it.
Crank some music.
- Here we go, Michelle.
Let's try it on.
Arnold Schwarzen-baby.
- Okay.
Let's work her out.
- Here we go, Michelle.
Work it out.
- And up!
Now go!
Again!
- And up!
Now breathe!
- Now go!
Now go!
Now work it!
- Now go!
Feel the burn!
Now go!
- Now up!
Now work it!
Now go!
- Now feel the burn!
Now go!
- Now work it!
Now go!
- Now feel the burn!
Now go!
Obviously, you feel pretty secure about those chubby little legs of yours.
Let's go with the center with the nicest people.
- Good thinking.
- Okay.
- I'll get this off.
- Come here.
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.
- Afternoon, Joe.
How'd it go today?
Two more job offers.
Bank teller and a stockbroker trainee.
- Great.
Which one are you gonna take?
- Neither.
The bank job, the bank was way up on this big hill.
Gotta go all the way up the hill, back down the hill.
Not my style.
Stockbroker job, they served me instant coffee.
Enough said?
You've been offered eight jobs and you found something wrong with all eight.
Hey, I know what I'm doing.
I don't wanna rush into anything.
I'm not gonna make the same mistake I did when I got into comedy.
Hi, Daddy.
Hi, Uncle Jesse.
Hello, Joe.
- Hello, Stephanie.
- Wanna watch Rocky & Bullwinkle?
No cartoons for me, Steph.
I am going to read The Wall Street Journal.
Cartoons.
I'm a businessman.
- I miss the old Joey.
- So do I. He's not happy about giving up comedy.
That's why he's turning down those jobs.
Joey's really starting to worry me.
Joey's always worried me.
Here we go.
It goes like this.
Try that.
No, no, wrong, wrong.
I stink!
My hands are too small.
My fingers cramp up.
It's just too hard.
Yes, D.J., it is hard at first, but-- How would you like to hear a story about a little boy?
I have a feeling I'm gonna hear it no matter what I say.
Once, there was a little boy who heard an Elvis Presley record.
- The King.
- Wonderful story.
It gets better.
It gets better.
This little boy, he was so inspired that he hopped on his bike he pedaled down to that pawnshop, traded his bike in for a guitar.
And that boy he sat in his room, he practiced day and night, night and day.
Where else could he go?
He had no bike.
Anyway, finally, one magical day the music surged through his body, into his fingertips, and he could do this: And you know what?
That little boy was me.
Big surprise ending.
So, what do you think?
Think I'll take the guitar down to the pawnshop and get myself a new bike.
- I'll never be a Bracelet.
I quit.
- D.J., you put The Bracelets together.
You can't quit.
I tried and I failed.
I'm just glad I figured this out now and not when I'm 46.
Joey.
Danny!
- What's the matter?
- We gotta come up with an idea to get Joey back into comedy.
All right.
I like that attitude.
What caused the sudden change of heart?
Daniel, Joseph is our friend.
He needs us.
Besides, I hate that moussy hair of his.
Come on.
It's nice of you guys to come watch me try out some new tunes.
Kind of strange being here at the old club.
This place has barely changed.
- Joe, you were here three days ago.
- Right.
Well, welcome to amateur night.
We got magicians, we got singers, we got comics.
And by popular demand, no mimes.
Let's start things off with the music of Jesse Cochran.
- Let's hear it.
- Go, Jess!
Yeah!
Thanks very much, but there's been a change in plans.
You see, this evening I'm going to begin my career as a standup comedian.
Oh, he's gotta be kidding.
I'd like to start off with a fast impression.
Goes like this: Hello, Wilbur.
Let's go down and visit some of my friends in prison.
Ladies and gentlemen, Ed Moose!
It's Mister Ed Meese.
He's stealing my material.
What do you care?
You quit doing comedy.
That's right.
I'm just a businessman enjoying the show.
Why is it, when you have a pretty date, and you say: "Hey, thank you, man.
I got a chemistry set"?
Hey, if you're gonna steal my jokes, steal them right, you yahoo-bird.
Realize you're the first comic in history to heckle his own act?
What's really strange is, you know how your mom, she can change any--?
Sorry.
Your mother, she can change anything into, like, an adjective.
A pronoun.
- A syllable.
- A verb!
A verb!
She can change.
Your mom-- Your mother can change anything into a verb.
It's like-- She comes-- No, I come-- No, she comes home, and she says-- No, I ask her: "Hey--" Mother.
"Hey, Mother".
I say, "Hey, Mom-- Mother, can I?
Hey, can I have a cookie"?
She says, "You want some milk with that"?
That is, "I'll cookie you"!
You're killing my jokes.
This is comedy murder.
- You think you could do better?
- This napkin could do better.
- Be my guest, pal.
- All right, fine.
Ladies and gentlemen, what he's trying to say is that when your mom-- I fell right into your little trap, didn't I?
Break your legs, buddy.
Ladies and gentlemen, the comedy of Joseph Gladstone.
All right, get out of here.
- Jesse Cochran!
Okay, that's enough.
- Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you!
See, what Jesse was talking about was moms and when you were younger.
My mom used to chase me around, but she didn't chase me with her legs she chased me with her arms.
So it was two propellers coming at me, like: "You get back here.
You get back here".
And I'm just going: "You're gonna take off and I don't think you have clearance from the tower".
I couldn't outrun my dad.
He'd chase me, pulling his belt like he was starting his hips.
"You come back here.
You come back here".
Oh, gosh.
Every time my dad pulled his belt, he ran faster.
I thought for years, "Maybe my dad's a riding lawn mower".
I didn't know.
Did you guys ever wake up, and you answer the phone and you sound just like Elmer Fudd?
So you're like, "Hello".
And you never admit to the other person that you just woke up.
We always lie.
"Oh, no, I've been up for hours and hours".
And you look in the mirror, and you look like Elmer Fudd.
"This is worse than I ever dreamed".
Oh, come on.
Quit it.
Get out of here.
- Thanks for all your help.
- All right.
Yeah.
That's where you belong.
Up on stage, bringing joy to total strangers.
You're right.
I just get so tired of waiting for that big break.
And the paycheck that goes with it.
Take one of those jobs.
Why do you think I work as an exterminator?
Think I play rock 'n' roll music to support my bug-killing habit?
You're right.
I'm gonna find something I can do at home.
That way, I can still watch the girls, make a few bucks and still do my act at night.
Tonight.
Tonight was my night.
Everything worked out great, and we all lived happily ever after.
Thank you and good night, guys.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold it, hold it, whoa.
Not so fast.
You want a hug, don't you?
Not unless I'm choking on a chicken bone.
No, it seems we have a problem with one of my little nieces.
We do?
Jesse told me when you quit comedy - D.J. quit playing the guitar.
- She did?
Apparently, the kid looks up to you for some strange reason.
- She does?
- And you know what to do about it.
- I do?
- You do.
I do.
You see?
He did.
Didn't he?
D.J.?
D.J. Joey, this isn't what it looks like.
It looks like you're watching David Letterman.
Okay, it is what it looks like.
What's up?
Well, Deej I just wanted to tell you what happened tonight.
Should we go someplace else so we don't wake Steph?
Are you kidding?
The kid slept through Johnny Carson.
- Not that I was watching it.
- Oh, no.
Well, D.J., guess what.
I got back up on-stage tonight, I did my standup, and I was great.
But I thought you quit.
Well, I did, but I. I think I was just frustrated and looking for the easy way out.
I get it.
Jesse told you I quit the guitar, and now you're here to talk me out of it.
So I guess I can skip "the tortoise and the hare" story.
I'd appreciate it.
I didn't quit just because of you.
I quit because I stink.
D.J., how do you know you stink?
You've only been playing a week.
But if you keep practicing, you might get really good at it.
But if you quit now, you may never know.
He's right, D.J. - What are you doing up?
- I'm not up.
I'm talking in my sleep.
D.J., one more thing.
Giving up isn't your style.
You put The Bracelets together.
I mean, you picked the name of the group.
D.J., you get things done.
The D.J. I know wouldn't give up just because it's the easy way out.
Good night, girls.
Good night, Joe.
- Call me Joey.
- Really?
You're Joey again?
That's correct, my little friends.
So nightie-night night.
He's back.
Joey's back.
Very nice, D.J. Very nice.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Okay, Honeybees.
Let's all "bee" seated.
- Who knows what today is?
- Me!
- Stephanie.
- Today the Honeybee Honey Drive starts.
- Very good, Stephanie.
- Thank you.
Joey, as honorary Queen Bee, will you pass out the sample honey?
Linda, I would "bee" delighted.
I know our hive is gonna raise lots of money for underprivileged children.
And the Honeybee who sells the most honey will win this special grand prize.
Steph.
- Stephanie.
- Steph.
Yeah.
- You haven't won the bike yet.
- Yet.
That seat was made for my tush.
I would like to introduce a young lady who holds the record for selling 725 jars of honey.
A Honeybee legend, I might add.
Let's put your wings together for D.J. Tanner!
All right.
Thank you, Honeybees.
Ah, memories.
Honeybees, any kid can sell raffle tickets for a color TV but to unload this stuff, you gotta work your little stinger off.
So, what are you gonna do?
Sell!
Let me hear it.
Sell!
Sell!
Sell!
- Hello.
- Attack!
Hold it!
Been wiping out bugs all day a few more won't make a difference.
Get out.
Get out.
You.
See me later.
Sure, yuk it up.
It just so happens that I am an honorary Queen Bee.
Joseph, this is no news to me.
What's this?
It's a tree house.
It's from your mom.
My mom always sends me the dopiest gifts.
I think it's for Michelle.
Hi, guys.
Are the Honeybees here?
- I didn't miss them, did I?
- Yes, they're still here.
More importantly, I believe, so is their hive mother, Linda.
Linda?
Jesse, my daughter is a Honeybee.
And Linda just happens to be her hive mother.
She also happens to be very pretty and very divorced.
And you happen to like her, don't you?
Purely as an insect.
Face it, man.
You're smitten.
- I am not smitten.
- I know smitten.
You are smut.
Why don't you ask her out.
It's obvious you're ready to start dating again.
I don't know.
You think it's been enough time?
Danny, it's been a year since Pam died.
I don't think you should feel bad about seeing other people.
Yeah, but dating.
I haven't been on a date since I took Pam to the senior prom.
I don't remember how to ask a girl out.
Same way you asked my sister out.
How'd you do that?
Well, Joey asked her out for me.
This Joey?
Joey was sort of my expert on romance.
This Joey?
It just so happens that I have a way with women.
Yes, you look at them, and they run away.
Excuse me.
Daniel, listen.
You're a reasonably semi-attractive young man.
You've lived with me long enough, something must have rubbed off.
Go in there, be bold, be confident and ask that girl out.
- Don't come back until you got a date.
- That's right.
Go!
- You're right.
I can do this.
- Right.
- Is my cowlick sticking up?
- Your cowlick.
Go.
Get out.
- Oh, Linda, hi.
- Hi, Danny.
What a nice surprise.
I forgot the Honeybees were even meeting today.
Well, we're just wrapping things up.
Why don't you all buzz into the car.
Thanks for letting us use your house again.
Anytime.
Mi hive is su hive.
Mr. Tanner, will you please buy some honey?
- Sweetheart, come here.
- Yes, Mommy?
Oh, I think Mr. Tanner will be buying his honey from Stephanie.
You know, you can never have too many jars of honey.
- Sign me up for three jars.
- Thanks, Mr. Tanner.
- You're welcome.
- I don't believe this!
I must be dreaming.
Daddy, I need that bike.
Sweetheart, I'm gonna buy from you too.
I'll tell you what.
I'll take 10 jars.
Ten jars?
All-- Only 10?
Dad, you just bought three from the competition.
This sweet, young child is your own flesh and blood.
- Fifteen jars?
- Twenty.
- Seventeen.
- Deal.
Now, that's how you set records, kid.
- You just bought 20 jars of honey.
- That's nothing.
When D.J. set the record, I bought 112.
I built a honey cellar downstairs.
You know, you're really a great dad.
- I've got the kids waiting in the car.
- Linda, wait.
Do you ever go to the movies?
Sure.
I love movies.
No kidding?
Me too.
It's a small world.
Two people who love movies living in the same city.
It's amazing.
Where was I?
I think you were kind of working up the courage to ask me out.
Right.
I'm still working on it.
Danny, I've got a car full of Bees.
But I've got two tickets to a modern art exhibit tonight.
I'd love for you to be my guest, if I find a sitter.
- Jesse and Joey can do it.
- Great.
Then we can have dinner too.
My treat.
Pick you up around 7?
Okay?
- Okay.
- It's a date?
- It's a date.
- Great.
I have a date tonight.
I have a date tonight.
I have a date tonight.
I have a date tonight!
I have a date tonight.
And why not?
Michelle, when we put together this dream house it will make Benny the Dishrag look like.
Well, look like a dishrag.
Hi, guys.
What's happening?
- You tell us.
- Well, I'd like to but I have to get ready for my date tonight!
My man!
All right!
You did what I told you, right?
You were bold you asked her out, and she said yes, right?
No.
I was shy and I was awkward, and she asked me out, and I said yes.
- No.
- Yes.
She's treating me to dinner and to an art exhibit.
She's paying?
How's this shy and awkward thing work?
Danny, you're gonna go out tonight and have a great time.
That's right.
And we're gonna watch your girls.
The girls.
How am I gonna tell D.J. and Stephanie that their father is going out on a date?
Any ideas?
- Well.
- Tell him, Joseph.
- Trust your instincts.
- Right.
Trust your instincts and tell them exactly what they need to know, but nothing more.
- Just tell them that.
- I like that, Jess.
I like that.
Listen to what they say and respond accordingly.
Accordingly respond to what they say.
And most importantly, be their father.
Yeah.
You have no clue how to handle this, do you?
- Don't know what I'm talking about.
- I don't either.
Michelle?
You'll tell your sisters for me, won't you?
Thank you, honey.
You take all the pressure off.
Give me a kiss.
Thanks.
you gotta be a salesman, like this: "Hi, my name's Stephanie Tanner.
I'm a Honeybee and we're raising money for needy kids.
Jars of honey make wonderful birthday gifts and your purchase is tax-deductible.
Talk about a honey of a deal".
That was awesome!
- Hey, girls.
- Go for it.
Hi, Daddy.
I'm Stephanie Tanner, and this honey is tax duckbills.
Happy birthday.
Sweetheart, I bought 17 jars from you already.
Deej, take your sister and sit down because right now I wanna have a little talk with my three girls about something important.
Tonight, your father is going on a. You know, let me have two more jars.
Great!
You girls, you like Julie's mom, Mrs. Stratton, don't you?
- Sure.
- She's a nice hive mother.
Well, great.
Because tonight, Julie's mom and I are.
We're.
Make it four more jars.
I'm getting good at this.
I better just say this before I go broke.
Julie's mom and I are going out tonight.
Oh, boy!
Where are we going?
No, angel, it's just me and Julie's mom.
- Why can't we go?
- Steph, you don't get it.
They're going on a date.
Dad doesn't want us there.
They wanna be alone.
D.J., wait!
It's not that we wanna be alone.
We just wanna get to know each other.
Well, Dad, couldn't you stay home with us?
I need you to help me with my homework.
And Stephanie probably needs you too.
Right, Steph?
I guess so.
Daddy, if you go on a date tonight is Julie's mommy gonna be our new mommy?
Your new mommy?
Of course not.
You know, people go out on dates and they don't get married.
You understand that, don't you?
I don't know.
I'm not sure what's going on.
I'll tell you exactly what's going on.
We need dad here, and he's leaving.
Why don't I just change my plans and stay with you three girls, then?
For the rest of my life.
Hi, Linda?
Yeah, it's Danny.
Look, I feel real uncomfortable about this but I have to cancel out on our date.
I'm starting to feel like it's too soon for this.
Thanks for understanding.
Yeah.
Bye.
- What happened?
- I thought you were ready to start dating.
I was, until I saw the looks on those girls' faces.
Although Michelle took it pretty well.
You think I should've kept my date, don't you?
- Yes.
I do.
- I agree with him.
Who said that?
Look, Daniel, yes, it is hard on the girls, man but they love you.
They'll learn to deal with it.
I just think my dating will be much easier once the girls are away at college.
Oh, yeah.
You'll be pushing 50, hanging out at singles bars.
"Hi.
Danny Tanner.
Capricorn.
Wanna hold my teeth"?
Danny, this is always gonna be a tough situation.
But do you wanna keep postponing your life?
Well, no.
Danny, the decision is yours.
What do you really wanna do?
- I really wanna go out with Linda.
- Now you're talking, brother!
- Lay it down.
- All right.
- Come on, Joseph, get the stuff.
- Okay.
Hi, Linda?
Danny here.
Yeah, did someone call you before saying it was too soon for me to start dating?
I thought so.
Linda that was my evil twin brother, Manny Tanner.
If it's not too late, I'd really like to see you tonight.
- Great.
So you'll pick me up at-- - Hi, Dad.
Could you hold on a second?
Hi, girls.
Dad, we were talking, and it was so nice of you to cancel your date for us we wanna thank you by taking you out for ice cream.
- Our treat.
- Because you're a great dad.
And we love you so much.
Thanks.
I love you too.
- Thanks, Dad.
- Thanks, Daddy.
This is Manny Tanner, the evil twin.
Something's come up, and Danny can't make it tonight.
He's really very sorry, and he'll call you later if I let him.
Bye.
You might wanna use wing nut 34.
Wing nut 34 Will you?
You sure you don't wanna take one look at the instructions?
Joseph, do not question the master.
This is quite simple, my friend.
There is a roof there is a floor, there are legs, there is this part which is obviously bonus firewood.
Do you guys wanna come with Dad and us for ice cream?
Girls, we have a better idea.
Yeah.
Why don't we take you girls out for ice cream so your daddy can go to that art exhibit?
Because that idea stinks.
Right, Steph?
Maybe.
Who knows?
I've been confused all day.
I know you're worried about your dad dating again, but I know how you feel.
- How would you know?
- Well you see, I was only 6 when my parents got divorced and I wasn't very happy when my mom started to date again.
My grandma used to come and babysit and she used to pinch my cheeks so hard, it was just.
Just tell the story, huh?
Anyway, I got used to my mom dating again and she was much happier because she wasn't so lonely.
You think Dad's lonely?
Yes, I do.
You know what?
I think your dad would be very happy if he could go on that date.
- Well, I want Dad to be happy.
- I do too.
Come on, D.J. Let's go talk to Daddy.
All right.
Done, Joseph.
Without instructions.
Looking good.
Come on, I'll build the master a club sandwich.
All right.
Coming, master?
Yeah, yeah.
I'm.
Yes, of course I'm coming.
Nice suit.
Did you get that from a realtor?
Steph.
Before we go talk to Dad, come with me.
What's wrong?
I don't know about this.
Buy you said you wanted Daddy to be happy.
Yeah.
But we're forgetting somebody very important.
- Who?
- Mom.
Mom?
What do you mean?
Well, maybe Mom wouldn't be so happy about Dad going out on dates.
Wow.
I never thought of that.
I don't want Mom to be not happy, and I don't want Daddy to be not happy.
And I don't want us to be not happy.
This is so complicated.
I think I'm having my first headache.
- Daddy, can we talk to you?
- Sure.
I thought we were going out for ice cream.
We wanted to make sure we still liked it.
Come here.
Sit next to me.
Give me my kid.
All right.
Thank you.
Okay, girls what's wrong?
Well, it's kind of hard to explain.
No, it's not.
D.J. was wondering if you still love Mom.
Of course I still love Mom.
She was the first love of my life.
Together we made three little miracles.
I'm always gonna love her.
Nothing will change that.
Not a date.
Not even if I fall in love with someone else one day.
Well, how do you think Mom would feel about that?
I know exactly how she would feel.
- You do?
- How?
Well, moms and dads talk about all kinds of things and one night, we had a long talk about what we would do if something ever happened to one of us.
We talked about making sure you were all taken care of.
And we agreed that if either one of us ever became single again we should try to meet someone else to share our life with.
So Mom would be happy if you went on a date?
I think she would be.
She would know that I'm not looking for someone to take her place just to make a new friend.
I could never forget Mom.
I think about her every time I look at you.
And you.
And you too.
Well, maybe we could take you out for ice cream another night.
We already had two bowls anyway.
Go on your date, Dad.
That's very sweet, but I don't think I can call Julie's mom again.
- I already broke our date twice.
- I'll call her.
D.J., you don't have to do that.
It's 555-8713.
All right!
Yes!
Okay.
Get this off, here.
Hey, Linda's waiting downstairs.
She's here already?
How is she dressed?
Casual?
Trendy?
Semi-trendy?
Quasi-casual?
Wearing a chicken suit with flippers.
Go!
Oh, God, I'm dating again.
How do I look?
Be brutal.
- You look good.
- Fine.
I hate the way I look.
I don't blame you, but there's just not enough time for a nose job now.
Guys, look, I need your help here.
I've gotta put together a look.
- I got something for you.
- I have a look for you.
Well, I'm glad we had this time to get acquainted.
Maybe we should go up and play with the girls.
I promise Danny will be down in just a second.
Yo, Daniel!
You got a pretty girl-- Your cowlick looks fine!
I know.
I flattened it out.
- Hi, Linda.
- Hi, Danny.
- Or is it Manny?
- No, it's Danny, the good twin.
Thanks for waiting.
Sorry about all the confusion.
I understand.
When I started dating again, I went through the same craziness.
Michelle wants to say goodbye.
Go ahead, Michelle.
You don't even have to say it.
I know.
Don't stay out late, because you're gonna wake me up at 3.
- Bye-bye, Deej.
- Bye.
- Say goodbye to Steph for me.
- Okay.
- Shall we go?
- We shall.
- You kids behave yourselves.
- Take two dimes for a phone call.
Go!
- Go on.
- Have fun.
- Be good.
- Go on.
All right, Michelle, this is the moment we've all been waiting for.
It's time to throw away Benny the Dishrag because you're now the proud owner of a brand-new, man-eating tree house!
- All right, pal.
Here we go.
- Come on, let's go.
Ready?
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Okay, Michelle, your grandma's gonna make you an outfit.
We have to get your measurements.
- Hold her arms up, Joey.
- Okay.
Reach for the sky, Michelle.
Sorry.
I couldn't resist those cute little pits of yours.
All right, here we go.
First, we start off with the chest.
- Okay.
- And it is - 18 inches.
- Eighteen.
Okay.
Now we go to her tummy - which is 18 inches.
- Eighteen inches?
Michelle, you little butterball.
And she's self-basting.
You better hope grandma's not knitting anything with horizontal stripes.
- All right, let's get her hips.
Here we go.
- Okay, hips.
And.
Eighteen.
Eighteen, 18, 18.
Exact same measurements as her father.
- Stand up.
We gotta get her inseam.
- Okay.
Okay, come on.
- Here we go.
- Stand up, Michelle.
- Do something fun.
Make this fun.
- Okay.
- Do some voices.
- What does a moo-cow say?
Moo-cow says, "moo".
And your dad lets these people take care of you?
Hey, it's hard to find good help.
Say "moo".
- Wanna come to the church bake sale?
- I can't.
I'm waiting for my cousin, Steve.
I haven't seen him in two years.
D.J., you gotta come.
This year I made The Three Wise Men out of strudel.
Kimmy, Steve's like my big brother.
We go ice skating.
We mess around.
We have so much fun.
It's like we're not even related.
- What's he look like?
- Well, looks aren't everything.
A real geek-burger, huh?
Well, he does have glasses and braces and zits but other than that, he's really cute.
Geek-burger with cheese.
Hey, Stevemeans get in here.
Sorry, that was my first.
- Greetings from Baltimore.
- Steve?
D.J., how you doing, sport?
Hi, Steve.
- What happened to your glasses?
- Oh, I got contacts.
- Your braces?
- Got them off.
- Your face full of zits?
- They cleared up.
One night, I went to bed looking like a nerd and woke up like this.
Isn't nature great?
The best.
Kimmy do you realize you slammed the door in my face?
What door?
- Let me help you.
- Great.
You'll be staying in our beautiful, spacious alcove.
All right.
D.J., can you believe your little cousin Stevie is being offered a baseball scholarship from Stanford?
I am really proud.
I can't get over how you've shot up.
I give the credit to good food, plenty of exercise and all that sleep I got during class.
He's funny too.
I'm sorry.
We haven't met.
I'm.
I'm.
You're Kimmy Gibbler.
How did she make it all the way to fifth grade?
Jesse!
Joey!
Where are you?
!
- Hey, Steve-o!
- Hey, cousin Steve!
Wait, wait, let me guess.
Uncle Danny's told me all about you guys.
Now you've gotta be Jesse, the great-looking rock 'n' roller who gets all the girls and spends hours on his hair.
And you must be Joey, the guy with all the funny voices.
Steve, that's Joey and this is Jesse.
But thanks anyway.
Here's someone else you haven't met.
Say "hello" to your new cousin, Michelle.
Oh, hi.
Hi, sport.
What's the matter, don't you speak baby?
Steve, I've got our whole weekend planned out.
This afternoon, we go ice skating, okay?
I don't know.
I kind of felt like playing some basketball.
- All right!
B-ball!
- All right!
Let's shoot some hoops!
- I'm psyched!
- All right!
Let me go get my sweats on.
Oh, D.J., wait.
D.J., somebody's gotta stay here with Michelle and Stephanie.
- Would you mind?
- All right.
- Thanks.
We'll be back in an hour.
- Let's go!
- Let's go!
Let's go!
- Okay, let's pass the ball.
- Jess, I'm open.
- Danny.
- Danny, here, I'm open.
- Think fast, Steve!
- Steve, drop-pass.
I'm open.
- Here, Jess.
- All right.
- Jess, right here.
- I'm open.
- All right, Joey.
- Right here, Joey.
- Joey.
Right here.
- Joey.
- Joey.
- Got another ball?
- Let's go.
This is gonna be great.
Steve and I will eat lunch together then I'll show him these pictures of us from Thanksgiving two years ago.
How long is Steve gonna be staying at your house?
Three or four days.
Me too.
We got bologna, salami and cheese, peanut butter and grape jelly.
Sounds good.
I just hope you didn't put them all into one sandwich.
- Here, look at this one.
- Oh, neat.
- Hi, Stevie.
- Hi, guys.
We made lunch.
- Lunch!
- Food!
Food!
- Food!
Food!
- Food!
Food!
Hey, Laker-Celtic game's on.
All right!
Some more B-ball!
- B-ball, B-ball, B-ball.
- B-ball, B-ball, B-ball.
Girls, come watch the game with us.
Animals.
Glad I saved this.
Come on!
Go!
- Yes!
- Yes!
- Yes!
- Yes!
Yes.
I think the Lakers can repeat as champions.
If they do, they'd be the first since Boston in '69 and '70.
Hey, Steve, you like my jeans?
They're brand-new.
Oh, yeah, great.
The Lakers have the best record since Portland back in '78.
They've got everything.
They got speed, power, depth and, most importantly the Laker Girls.
- Yes.
- Yes.
- Yes.
- Yes.
Yes!
What an awesome thing that just happened.
You don't have a clue either, do you?
- Does anybody else want another pickle?
- We're out of pickles.
I'll get you some.
If there are no pickles at my house I'll take a cab to the market.
- Bye, Stevie.
- See you later, Kammy.
That's Kimmy.
Hey, if it's "Kammy" to him, it's "Kammy" to me.
- I'll bet two bucks Magic steals the ball.
- Not the way Bird's playing.
You're on.
Magic steals the ball.
- No.
- Yes.
Two Founding Fathers, please.
Thank you.
Joey, that's incredible.
I come from a long line of psychics.
You mean psychos.
- Give me a chance to win my money.
- Okay.
I'm getting another vision here.
I'll bet two more bucks that Cooper steals the ball passes off to Magic, who'll lead a fast break downcourt end it with a slam-dunk by Worthy.
You're out of your gourd.
All right, you're on.
Look at this.
Cooper steals the ball, fast break.
Magic to Scott to Magic, no-look pass to Worthy.
Slam-dunk!
No way!
- Unbelievable.
- That's amazing.
Sometimes, I'm so good, I actually win money from myself.
Thank you.
Joey, you didn't know all this stuff when we watched this game this morning.
Kids, what an imagination.
One final wager.
I'll bet that if you don't give my money back you're gonna die.
And I was gonna give you half.
- Baby alert.
I gotta check on Michelle.
- Watch the game.
I'll take care of the kid.
Oh, thanks.
I'm sure you can take care of her considering you have no experience with an infant whatsoever.
No problem.
Help him.
Your nephew Steve's a great kid.
Thanks for being so nice.
Ever since his dad moved out he hasn't had much guy stuff.
Yep.
Us guys gotta stick together.
Bite.
Hey, what's the matter, Michelle?
Are you hungry?
Sleepy?
Grumpy?
Bashful?
Dopey?
Sneezy?
Doc?
Having fun?
Yeah.
I always have fun here.
Your dad is great.
- I'm real glad you're back.
- Hey, is the little kid okay?
I think she needs a changing.
No, thank you.
Be my guest.
You'll be fine.
I just think you need a dry run at this.
I think we're a little too late for that.
No, I mean practice on the monkey.
Oh, right.
- All right.
- Okay.
Put the diaper on.
Okay.
Hey, Steve, you wanna go ice skating tomorrow?
Oh, I can't.
Your dad's taking me to a Warriors game.
Okay.
Well, we can go tomorrow.
And since we'll be there at the mall, we can go to a movie and eat pizza and my friend Jennifer's having a boy-girl party.
I'll be pretty busy the whole time I'm here.
I gotta look at some colleges and, besides, I'm a little too old for that kind of stuff.
Okay, so I tape right, tape left.
All right, this monkey is ready to party.
Hi, Michelle.
How's everything going, Steve?
Well, I think this speaks for itself.
Nice work.
- Cheetah looks happy.
- Yeah.
The Bullets are playing the Pistons.
All right!
I gotta see this.
D.J., you have plans for tomorrow afternoon?
Not anymore.
Well, you do now.
We're all going to the park.
- How's some touch football sound?
- Great!
Yeah!
Then we can play some soccer, basketball, volleyball and tennis.
Then we'll play a game of "Let's Rush Uncle Danny to the Hospital".
- Great.
Come on.
- See you.
After the game, I'll take you to the locker room, introduce you to the team.
Really?
I've gotta meet Ralph Sampson.
The man is a building.
The team is a city.
Let's have a little talk here.
What do you think of your cousin Steve?
I know.
He's just a big jock.
You should've known him two years ago, back when he was my friend.
He doesn't care about me anymore.
All he cares about is sports.
Guess you're just nothing around here, unless you're one of the guys.
I really appreciate this.
Tomorrow's my first real game of touch football.
- I don't wanna look stupid.
- Stop.
You look stupid already.
- What did I do?
- D.J., you don't call it "football".
You call it "football"!
- Football!
- Yes!
That's it!
You got lesson number one.
Now, lesson number two: The ever-popular psych-out.
No words.
Just sheer intensity.
Observe.
- It's like that.
- Something like that.
Let's show her.
Let's run a play.
Watch this.
Down and out, fake to the flag, button-hook back and I'll hit you.
- Got it.
- Here we go.
You're gonna love this.
Ready?
Hut, hut!
Go!
All right.
Go, Joey!
Watch this.
I'm reading the defense, right?
Checking the pass rush.
I'm checking my receivers.
I'm still checking my receivers.
I'm checking my watch.
Joey!
Where are you?
Sorry.
I just stopped off for a quick bite in the secondary.
Hit me!
I'm open!
- Touchdown!
- Spike it!
The football!
Yeah!
Now this is fun.
How do you guys know all this?
- Well, because we're guys.
- Yeah.
You see, it's in our blood.
Guys are just born knowing how to play.
- Football!
- Football!
All right.
Half of that money's mine, kid.
- Want another one of my sandwiches?
- No, thanks.
Three's enough.
Speaking of basketball, did you know that Wilt Chamberlain scored the most points ever in an NBA game?
And Moses Malone joined the league right out of high school.
And if the Bulls built their team around Michael Jordan, they'd be unstoppable.
Enough talk.
Let's play football!
- All right!
- Football!
All right, we'll pick teams.
I'll be a captain, because it's my football.
- All right, I'll be a captain.
- Because your hair looks like a helmet.
- Football!
- Football!
- Yes.
- Watch Michelle.
There you go.
Let's go.
Let's pick.
Okay, the first person I'm gonna pick.
- My man, Steve!
- Yeah!
All right, Uncle Danny.
Let me see.
The first person I'm gonna pick is - my man, D.J. - Yeah!
I want you!
I want you!
Let me see.
If I'm not on Steve's team, I'll die.
Kimmy.
Way to go, big Stevie.
Okay, here we go.
Let's see, I'll pick-- I need someone with good hands.
I need someone with good hands.
I'll pick my man, Michelle.
Come on, Michelle.
High-five.
High-five Can you believe he picked Michelle over me?
Steph, please, I have my own problems.
Okay, Steph.
You can be on our team.
- What?
- Low-five.
Somebody please pick me before a stray dog shows up.
Okay, we'll take Joey, but you guys gotta spot us a touchdown.
- That's only fair.
- Enough messing around.
- Let's play football!
- Football!
Here we go.
Remember, the end zones are that bench and this tree here.
Let's go, Joey!
Let's get this game underway.
Here we go!
Here we go!
- All right.
- All right.
Gibbler, you're dead meat.
All right.
Hut, hut, hut!
- Here we go.
Here we go.
- D.J., D.J.!
Yes!
- Touchdown!
- Yeah!
- In your face!
- In your face!
Don't worry about it, big guy.
You know, I'm worried about you.
Told you you were dead meat, Gibbler.
- Steve, aren't we having the best time?
!
- Yeah.
What are you looking at, chump?
Nothing, fool.
- Let's get them, Stevie.
- Yeah.
Don't even think about it.
- Okay, Steph.
Here we go.
- Here we go.
On three.
Hut, hut, hut!
All right.
Here, Steph.
Go!
Come on!
Got her!
We almost fell for the old Statue of Stephanie trick.
All right.
You girls had your fun.
Now it's time for us guys to play some real football.
Yeah!
Hey!
Just because we're girls doesn't mean we can't play.
Let's put the ball down and see what you guys are made of.
- Okay, Steph.
Let's go.
- Here we go.
- Here we go!
Last play.
- Here we go!
Ready, sweetie?
Okay, on two.
Hut!
Hut!
I like three better.
Sorry.
You're right.
My mistake.
Okay, on three.
Hut, hut, hut!
Yes.
Come on, Steph.
- Steve, go long!
- I'm going long.
- Yeah!
- D.J., what are you doing?
- Playing football, man.
- Well, look, this is touch football.
- What's your problem?
- I got no problem.
You got a problem?
Yeah, that was a pass interference.
Automatic first down.
No way, you wimp!
D.J., Steve's right.
You were way out of line.
We're not playing tackle.
Oh, sure, take Steve's side.
You guys are such buddies.
Why don't you just adopt him.
That's what you want, isn't it?
Great.
Now I'm gonna start crying like a little girl.
D.J. - Halftime.
- Halftime.
Shake it off, big fella.
D.J what's with the "why don't you adopt him" stuff?
Oh, come on, Dad.
It's pretty obvious.
You're taking Steve to ball games, having fun, high-fives all over the place.
You know Steve's dad moved out last year.
Steve needs me right now.
- It's real important for him to-- - I know.
Hang out with the guys.
What's wrong with that?
Nothing, unless you're a girl.
Dad, I wanna spend time with him too.
We used to be such good friends.
I don't know what happened.
I'll tell you what's happened.
Steve's grown up a lot in the past two years.
He's becoming a young man.
D.J I know you're having a hard time with this but that's no reason to clean his clock.
Fine, Dad.
I'll go take Michelle and Stephanie, and we'll go play Duck Duck Goose.
Who is it?
It's Steve.
Can I come in?
Yeah, I guess.
You sure it's safe?
Yeah.
Thanks, I didn't wanna make the wrong move and get creamed again.
I've been here two days, and this is the first time I've ever been up to your room.
You're a busy guy.
Yeah, well, my schedule opened up, and I was hoping maybe I could talk to you.
To me?
You wanna talk to little old me?
Yeah.
Look, D.J., I was-- I was wondering why you clobbered me.
Because I felt like it.
Well, why did you feel like it?
Because I did.
Well, why did you?
Because I was mad at you.
I was looking forward to you visiting, and you didn't want to go ice skating.
I thought we could do stuff like we did last time.
I miss the old Steve.
D.J., I'm still the same Steve.
No, you're not.
The old Steve wouldn't have taken this long to come up to my room.
D.J., I'm sorry.
I wasn't thinking.
Look, but I'm here now.
D.J., I'm still your cousin, and I still love you.
So don't you think we can try and be friends again?
You seem so much older than me now.
Well, it may seem like a big difference now because I'm 17 and you're 11 but, you know, when I'm 100 and you're 94 you'll probably hardly even notice the difference.
So.
So.
So you wanna start all over?
Great idea.
All right.
I'll go outside, and I'll come right back in.
Okay.
Greetings from Baltimore.
Hi, Steve.
What happened to your braces, glasses and zits?
All gone.
Isn't nature great?
Hey, I got a great idea.
What do you say we go ice skating?
No, that's for little kids.
- But if you really wanna go.
- Yeah.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Samantha, I promise, this is gonna be the most romantic weekend of your life.
We'll have a little Chateaubriand.
A little Dom PÃ©rignon.
Yes, and for dessert an empty house.
The family's going away to Disneyland.
Yeah.
Two points.
They're leaving in three minutes.
If you leave now, make all the lights you'll be here in four minutes.
Two minutes after that we'll be in each other's arms gazing into each other's eyes doing a little thing I like to call-- - Uncle Jesse!
- The hokey-pokey.
Bye, Aunt Irene.
What is it, kid?
- I'm going to Disneyland!
- All right!
Come on, everybody, we're gonna be late for Disneyland!
Stephanie, hold it.
Yeah?
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
All right, take a deep breath now.
Relax.
Inhale.
Exhale.
Very good.
You okay?
- I'm fine.
- Good.
Disneyland, Disneyland, Disneyland!
Why aren't we in Disneyland?
- Steph, calm down.
- Disneyland, Disneyland, Disneyland!
- Let's go, let's go.
- You need to switch the kid to decaf.
Steph, the plane won't leave any earlier just because we're the first ones on it.
If we're the first ones on, we'll be the first ones off and the first in line for the Matterhorn.
Matterhorn?
Danny, we gotta go.
D.J., tell me again how it's gonna be.
Well, Disneyland has the greatest rides.
While you're in line, Mickey and Minnie play with you.
No!
What are we yakking about?
We could be there!
Come on, let's go.
Open the door before she goes through it.
Stephanie's right.
Tinker Bell's a-waiting.
Come on everyone.
Skedaddle.
Let's go.
- Let's skedaddle.
- Right.
Here we go.
We're leaving.
Everyone's going.
I'm going.
I'm going.
Jesse, you sure you don't wanna come with us?
Are you kidding?
No, no, no.
Who's gonna pick up the mail?
Who's gonna get the newspaper, feed the dog?
Jess, we don't have a dog.
Just because it's not our dog doesn't mean we shouldn't feed him.
Uncle Jesse, I really wish you were coming along but if we don't leave soon, I'm gonna go bananas!
She's right.
Any minute, bam!
Bananas.
Let's go.
They're going to Disneyland!
Yeah.
You know it's amazing.
You've been playing tennis all your life.
I started today, and I beat you three straight sets.
That's wild.
What are you smiling about?
Nothing.
I'm just smiling.
You're not just smiling.
That's a "you-let-me-win" smile.
Well.
- Tell me you didn't let me win.
- I didn't let you win.
She let me win.
- You tough guys are so cute.
- "You tough guys are so cute".
Oh, man, this is great.
Listen.
Nothing.
Sammy, do you realize that we've been going out a month?
- This is the first time we've been alone.
- I know.
- With me living at my folks' house.
- And me living at Pee-wee's Playhouse.
But tonight you and I will play house.
We're gonna celebrate.
We're gonna celebrate.
I'm gonna make the most romantic candlelight dinner.
- That sounds perfect.
- So, what will it be?
Extra crispy or original recipe?
That's cute.
I'm gonna go take a shower and I'll be thinking about you.
Have mercy!
And if you hear me laughing, it's because I'm thinking of your backhand.
Look out!
Too obvious.
Sammy, brought you some champagne.
Jesse.
Can't blame me for trying.
Thank you.
If you'll excuse me, I'm going to slip into my evening attire.
Okay, let's go.
Come on, Steph.
Missing Disneyland isn't the end of the world.
You know airplanes can't fly when it's foggy.
I hate fog.
Birds can fly in fog.
We should have taken a bird.
Steph, I promise, we'll go to Disneyland another time.
Yeah, it was Michelle's first time too.
Look how well she's taking it.
What would she know?
She puts her food up her nose.
Steph, I'll tell you what I've got a great idea.
We're gonna make tonight family fun night, right here at home.
What could be more fun than that?
I'll tell you what.
Something that starts with a D and ends with a "land".
These disappointments are tough on a 6-year-old.
I still can't believe we missed Captain Eo.
Steph, what do you wanna do tonight?
Mope.
- I'll drop off the kid.
- I'll let Jesse know we're back.
Jesse, we got fogged in.
We're back.
What did you say, Jess?
Hey, Jess.
You wear these clothes every time we leave the house?
Have mercy.
- You're not Jesse.
- Neither are you.
I'm Samantha.
I'm me.
Danny.
That's short for Daniel.
It's long for Dan.
- Maybe I should just get dressed.
- Not in there.
Your clothes would get wet.
Excuse me.
Door used to be over there.
I'm really sorry.
Imagine my surprise.
Imagine if you came in and saw me in the shower.
Then you'd really be sorry.
Trust me.
Oh, there's shampoo and conditioner in there.
And there's some Woolite on the shelf in case you want to soak a fine washable.
Thank you.
Jesse!
Jesse!
Oh, no.
It couldn't be.
Could it?
- Whoa, look at all the food.
- Oh, yum.
Steph, this is great.
Let's take a trip to Dinnerland.
Oh, it's Dinnerland.
There's lots of fun here.
Oh, I love it here at Dinnerland.
Oh, shrimp.
Hey, Jess.
How's it going?
Let go of my shrimp.
Put down my shrimp!
Why aren't you guys at Disneyland?
Fog, fog, fog.
I hate fog.
Jesse, I just met your friend upstairs.
She's very clean.
I hope we didn't ruin your weekend.
Oh, no.
Why would you think that?
Just because I've waited a month to be with Sam.
I've waited five and a half years to go to Disneyland.
I hate fog.
I really hate fog.
- Okay, are we ready for family fun night?
- All right!
Hot dog.
Hot dog.
Let's sing your favorite one from school.
I got it planned.
Here we go.
Jesse, you play the guitar, D.J., the tambourine.
Do you know "If You're Happy and You Know It, Clap Your Hands"?
Yeah, that was on MÃ tley CrÃ¼e's first Christmas album, right?
On three, everybody.
One, two, three!
Take it, Steph.
Wasn't that festive?
Next verse!
On three.
One, two, three.
Everybody!
Take it, Joe.
Hey, stomp your feet, would you?
Do you have this much fun every night?
Yes, hard to believe, isn't it?
Steph, aren't we having a good time?
It's no Country Bear Jamboree.
Honey, if you don't think about you-know-where it'll be a lot easier.
We'll sing "Row, Row, Row Your Boat".
We'll do it as a round, it'll be great.
Dad, that's dopey.
Dopey!
Don't say that.
Honey, look, it's been a long day.
I know you're tired, you're worn-out, you're grumpy.
- Grumpy!
- Sorry.
What I meant was you're probably slee-- Exhausted.
You were gonna say, "Sleepy".
Thanks for trying, but family fun night's just not any fun.
Guess that kind of puts a damper on Simon Says.
I'll go talk to her.
- Here.
Here.
Take your kid.
- Thanks.
Why don't we go into the kitchen so that?
So that Jesse doesn't have to make that face.
Yeah.
You believe it, sport?
We're finally alone.
You know your family's terrific.
I had a great time tonight.
But we could have had a really great time tonight.
Well, let's do it tomorrow night.
I know this terrific bed and breakfast place in the Napa Valley.
That sounds so.
So frustrating.
I promised I'd babysit the munchkin tomorrow night.
Well, another time.
They've gotta get that little girl to Disneyland some day.
I'm gonna miss you tonight.
What are you doing here?
Here.
Here's 5 bucks.
Go catch a movie.
- Steph, how you doing?
- I've been better.
I know how you feel.
No, you don't.
You've been to Disneyland.
Yeah, but I know what's it like not to get what you want.
Remember when I was supposed to do that Oat Boats cereal commercial?
And you got it instead?
Well, what did I do?
Did I mope?
No.
You chased me around the kitchen and tried to kill me.
Okay.
Bad example.
Well, there's only one sure way to make you smile.
- The tickle monster!
- It's not working.
- Then how come you're laughing?
- I'm not.
This is sad laughing.
Steph, I'm so glad to see you happy.
That didn't count.
The tickle monster made me laugh.
Stephanie, you have every reason to be sad.
And I completely understand.
Thank you.
Look, Steph, I want you to really think about this.
You're not always gonna get your own way.
While you're spending this time being sad about missing one thing you're missing out on a lot of other fun things, like our family sing-along.
That wasn't so much fun.
It wasn't fun for you because you didn't want it to be fun.
I had fun.
And D.J. had fun.
Right, Deej?
It was okay.
Fun.
Big fun.
So it's up to you.
Either you can feel sorry for yourself or you can feel bad for a while and shake it off and move on to the next fun thing.
But I think I know what you're gonna do because you like to smile too much.
- Right?
- I guess so.
I know something fun we can do right now.
What?
It has to do with dad and a certain monster.
- Uh-oh.
- "Uh-oh" is right.
- Here comes the tickle monster!
- Oh, no.
Tickle, tickle.
Go over there, leave me alone Comb your hair over there Come on, stop it.
I can't take it.
Hey, Jess, what's going on?
I don't know.
Every time I come in, it seems there's more pink bunnies on the wall.
Well, you know how rabbits are.
- Joey, sit down a second.
- Sure.
Joseph, can I talk to you man to.
Well, man to you?
Sure, buddy.
Hey, you look a little down.
Look, I'm sorry if we wrecked your night with Samantha.
It's not just Samantha, it's.
Joseph, be honest with me.
Doesn't living here get to you sometimes?
- No.
- Never?
Never.
I love it.
You mean you love changing diapers, making school lunches chasing the girls around, changing diapers, helping with homework picking up their toys.
Did I mention changing diapers?
Some of those tasks are more rewarding than others.
All right, why?
Why?
Joey, why are you happy here?
Well, Jess it's because when I was growing up, I didn't have brothers and sisters.
I like being part of a big family.
I like having people to care about, that includes you.
Thank you.
Besides, this is the only place I've lived that always has ice cream in the freezer.
Pass.
Joey, don't you ever ask yourself, "What am I doing"?
I mean, I used to be this freewheeling living-on-the-edge, no-strings kind of guy.
And now.
Now it seems like I'm-- I'm married or something.
I have all the responsibilities and hassles of three kids.
Yet I can't even deduct them from my taxes.
Well, technically you could if you married Danny.
Joey, do you realize every night I sleep here, I sleep alone?
Wanna get bunk beds?
No, I don't.
Joey, I'm pouring my heart out here to you and you're making jokes.
I know.
I'm sorry.
All right, talk to me.
I-- I don't know, I. I guess it's this whole situation.
It's getting to me.
I mean, I have zero privacy.
I try to write my music, and I have all these distractions.
See, I write music, I write it out of my own life experiences, you know.
My last songs have been about changing diapers the measles and tub toys.
I thought that tub toy song was very danceable.
I just feel like I have things to accomplish in my life, you know?
I mean, there's things that I wanna do, and there's things I wanna experience and I don't know, but maybe maybe living here is holding me back.
I don't know what the hell's happened to my life, but I gotta regain control of it.
Hey, Jess, look at the bright side.
If you hadn't have moved in here, we'd never be as close as we are.
- I know.
- Hey, sleep on it.
Hey.
Thank you, my friend.
Jesse?
Samantha?
Jesse?
Sammy, what are you doing here?
I just wanted to see you.
You shouldn't be in here, everybody's home.
Uncle Jesse, will you help me with my homework?
D.J., it's the middle of the night.
But the closer I study to my test, the less I forget.
Uncle Jesse, will you give me a piggyback ride?
Uncle Jesse doesn't wanna give you a ride.
- Yes, he does.
- No, he doesn't.
- Yes, he does.
- No, he doesn't.
Yes, he does.
Uncle Jesse, change my diaper.
You can't talk!
And you're not allowed to have girls here.
Girls, you gotta go.
Come on.
Everyone, off to bed.
Let's go.
Oh, good, guys.
Okay, great.
Take over for me.
- It's your turn.
- You're their uncle.
- We could be so happy.
- Everybody out.
Everybody go.
Come on.
Let's go.
Everyone.
Go, go.
Hold it.
You, you can stay.
- Uncle Jesse?
- Uncle Jesse?
- Help me with my homework.
- I want a piggyback ride.
- Jesse?
It's your turn.
- You're their uncle.
We could be so happy.
Change me.
Feed me.
- Change me.
- Feed me.
- Feed me.
Change me.
- Feed me.
Change me.
Feed me!
- Change me!
- Feed me!
Oh, my God.
There's two Michelles.
They're multiplying!
- Change me!
- Feed me!
- You're their uncle.
- Your turn.
- So happy.
- Help me with my homework.
- So happy.
- Feed me.
No!
I want a piggyback ride.
Help me with my homework.
It's your turn.
You're their uncle.
We could be so happy.
- Change me!
- Feed me!
- Change me!
- Feed me!
You're their uncle.
No!
Oh, I can't take it anymore.
I gotta get out of this house.
- Jess, wake up!
Rise and shine!
- Come on, let's go!
Get up!
"Guys.
I didn't wanna wake anybody up, so I left this note.
I need to get away for a while.
I don't know where I'm going.
I don't know when I'll be back, or even if I will be back.
I don't think it's working out for me here.
I'll call soon.
Tell the girls I love them.
Jesse".
Jesse ran away from home?
- I'm hungry.
- Where's Uncle Jesse?
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Sammy, do you realize that we've been going out a month?
This is the first time we've been alone.
- With me living at my folks' house.
- And me living at Pee-wee's Playhouse.
I sure hope we didn't ruin your weekend.
Oh, no.
Why would you think that?
Just because I've waited a month to be with Sam.
I used to be this freewheeling living-on-the-edge, no-strings kind of guy.
And now.
Now it seems like I'm-- I'm married or something.
I don't know what the hell's happened to my life, but I gotta regain control of it.
I don't think it's working out for me here.
I'll call soon.
Jesse ran away from home?
Jesse ran away from home?
- I'm hungry.
- Where's Uncle Jesse?
Girls, if you'll excuse us for a brief moment, I have to talk to Joey privately about this note that I wrote myself reminding me to talk to Joey privately about this note that I wrote.
What are we gonna say to the girls?
Joey, this is a delicate situation.
It's a father kind of moment.
You better let me handle it.
- And what do you want me to do?
- Just play dumb.
How do I do that?
Perfect.
Oh, hi.
You're back.
Did Uncle Jesse go somewhere?
Girls, your father has something to say.
Your Uncle Jesse has gone on a little - vacation.
- Where?
Where?
You saw him last.
Tell them, Joey.
Okay, Father.
Girls, your Uncle Jesse went on vacation to the desert.
And why, you ask?
Because he loves the hot sand and he loves the burning sun.
Bottom line: Your Uncle Jesse loves to sweat.
I thought he loved going to the beach.
Well, the desert is all beach.
Okay, here we go.
Your favorite strawberry yogurt banana pancakes just like your Uncle Jesse makes.
These aren't just like Uncle Jesse makes.
His aren't soupy in the middle.
Mine aren't soupy.
Here, Michelle.
You'll appreciate my cooking.
Thattagirl.
Go ahead.
Taste it, honey.
Everybody's a critic.
I got it.
Gladstone's International House of Flapjacks.
Gladstone speaking.
- Jesse!
- Oh, Jesse!
I wanna talk to him.
- Wait.
Let me talk.
- Hi, Jesse.
It's D.J. - Give me-- Let me talk to him.
- I'll talk to anyone you want - just make a decision.
- How the heck is the desert, Jess?
What desert?
I'm skiing in Tahoe.
I'm hanging out with my buddies, and I don't know when I'm coming back.
So in case there's an emergency I wanna give you the number.
It's 555-4322.
I gotta tell Uncle Jesse something.
- I gotta tell Uncle Jesse something.
- Okay, here.
Oh, no.
I forgot what I was gonna tell him.
Oh, I remember.
Silly me.
Hi, Uncle Jesse.
While you're on vacation, can I sleep in your room which was my room before it was your room?
Thanks, Uncle Jesse.
Everybody say bye.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.
Goodbye.
- Say bye-bye, Michelle.
What do you say?
Let's drink a toast to the return of our man, Jesse.
Thank you, thank you.
And a toast to my escape from Romper Room.
No, no, no.
To you paying for the cabin.
Fellas, this is only the beginning.
When I get back to town I'm gonna get my own place and start living life the way I was born to be.
- Yeah.
- All right.
Fellas, let's hit the slopes.
Going skiing.
Yeah!
All right.
I'll just put on my ski pants here.
Yeah, my little ski pants.
Looking good.
Okay, yes.
It's winter wonderland time, folks.
Winter wonderland.
I am psyched.
Just put on my scarf, because it's about eight degrees outside and, of course, the jacket.
Always remember, it is better to look good than to ski good.
Put on the gloves, the waterproof gloves.
And, of course, the cap, which is very important.
We get the goggles on.
Hey, man.
All right.
Fanny pack.
We mustn't forget the old fanny pack.
Gotta keep the fanny warm.
And the skis, and the poles, and.
God, I'm tired.
Would someone just break my leg now and stick me in front of the fire?
Dad, I always get my guitar lesson from Uncle Jesse.
- Are you sure you wanna do this?
- Honey, this is gonna be a lot of fun.
I'm gonna teach you a great song.
Come here.
Okay, now you watch what I do real carefully, and then you do it.
Dad!
Dad, stop.
Here's where I am.
Maybe froggie's not quite ready to go a-courtin' yet.
Let's work on that D chord.
Come on.
Sit right down here.
Now take these two fingers and put them on the second fret.
No, the second fret.
No, the second fret.
No, the second fret.
- No, the second-- - Dad, you're making me nervous.
How can I make you nervous?
I'm your father.
Because whenever you try to teach me things, we argue.
- No, we don't.
- Yes, we do.
- No, we don't.
- Yes, we do.
No, we don't!
- What am I doing?
- You're arguing with me.
I am not arguing with you.
You're arguing with me.
- Now, we're here to have fun.
- Well, I'm not having fun.
I'd have fun if Uncle Jesse was here.
That's what this is all about, isn't it?
All of Uncle Jesse's clothes are gone.
Is Uncle Jesse thinking about moving out?
The truth?
Yes.
I hate this.
When Mom died, I never thought I'd like living in this house again.
Then Uncle Jesse and Joey moved in and things got better.
I don't want anything to change.
Honey, I want him to stay as much as you do.
- Then why don't you get him back?
- Because he's an adult.
You can't just go pick him up and put him under your arm and bring him back home.
Right now he's struggling with some things.
When, and if the time is right, he'll be back.
Okay?
Well, it's not okay.
But okay.
Come on.
Let's finish the guitar lesson.
- What else did Uncle Jesse do?
- Well, he usually teaches me an Elvis song.
I know a great one.
Thanks for helping me move in, Michelle.
Why don't you just put that stuff right over there?
Thank you.
You know, Michelle, I grew up in this room.
Boy, this place brings back memories.
Here, Steph, you forgot the rest of your zoo.
Thanks, D.J. Isn't it neat we each have our own room for a couple of days?
It might be more than a couple of days.
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, nothing.
What is going on?
Steph, who do you think is a better singer?
Alvin or Theodore?
Are you serious?
Everybody knows without Alvin they're just a bunch of squirrels dressed like Don Johnson.
- You're right.
See you.
- Freeze.
- What is going on?
- All right, Steph, sit down.
You should hear this too, Michelle.
Uncle Jesse didn't just go on a vacation.
He's thinking about moving out.
- Can't Daddy get him back?
- Dad said there's nothing he can do.
- Then we gotta do something.
- You're right, Steph.
What if Uncle Jesse never comes back?
Daddy.
- Here's the plan.
I'll call Uncle Jesse.
- Check.
Then I'll tell him Michelle's really sick, and he'll come rushing back.
- Then what?
- Then you throw your arms around him and beg him to stay while I let the air out of his tires.
I need to speak to Jesse Cochran?
This is his niece, D.J. Tanner.
Jesse's still out skiing.
Could you hold the line for one brief moment?
- He's not there.
What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.
Let me think.
Okay, I got it.
This is Stephanie Tanner, Uncle Jesse's other niece.
Now listen very carefully.
Help!
Tell Uncle Jesse the baby's sick and she's coughing real bad.
Here, listen.
- Cough.
- Cough.
See?
The baby's coughing really loud.
Now, Uncle Jesse's the only one who can get her to take her cough medicine.
Promise me you'll tell him.
Thanks.
I lied.
I hate to lie.
But it was for a good cause.
I guess.
But if you could cough a few times, I'd feel a lot better about this whole dirty business.
Thank you.
Hi, guys.
Hey, Samantha.
God, this sport really is a pain in the butt.
Your family just called.
The baby's sick.
- Michelle's sick?
What does she have?
- Cough, I think.
Well, Joey and Danny are there, the pediatrician.
I'm sure she'll be fine.
Come on.
Let's do a little "Boys Are Back in Town".
All right.
"Boys Are Back in Town".
She'll be okay.
Here we go.
One, two, three, four: Hold down a second.
I gotta call home.
- Jesse, what's wrong?
- The kid is sick.
I'm her uncle.
She looks exactly like me.
Damn, it's busy.
I'm sorry, guys, but I'm the only one who can give her her cough medicine.
And I'm the best at singing her to sleep.
I'm sorry, fellas.
I gotta split.
Michelle needs me.
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.
But you knew when we got involved there were other women in my life.
- Hey, yes!
- Okay.
Okay, here's the shot.
I'm gonna jump over the couch, spin around three times, drive to the hoop double pump twice, finishing off with a reverse tomahawk monster jam.
Is this before or after you spin straw into gold?
Oh, yeah?
Watch this.
Yeah, I'd like to see Michael Jordan sink a shot like that with a couch on the court.
- How is she?
- Jesse.
- Hey, buddy.
- Where's Michelle?
- Do I need to give her her cough medicine?
- What are you talking about?
What do you mean, what am I talking about?
Somebody called and said Michelle was very sick.
- Michelle's fine.
- She's fine?
Thank God.
What do you mean, she's fine?
I've been driving for four hours from Lake Tahoe on my motorcycle in the freezing cold behind a cattle truck?
Well, I gotta tell you.
You made excellent time.
All right.
Which one of you called?
Must've been the girls.
You shook them up the way you took off like you did.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to do that.
But it was something I had to do.
- Jesse, hang on.
Talk to us.
- Yeah, maybe we can help you.
Look, guys.
Ever since I've been out of high school I've done what I wanted, whenever I wanted, with whomever I wanted.
I've had no one to answer to, nobody to worry about but myself, me.
So I took off to find that guy.
And you know what I found?
I was having a great time, hanging with my buddies, playing music then I get this call.
"Michelle is sick".
Just like that.
I come running back right into Mister Rogers' Neighborhood.
I'm sorry, guys.
I don't think it's where I wanna be.
Jesse, wait.
You're going about this all wrong.
Maybe when you moved in you lost something.
- But look how much you've gained.
- What, Joseph, have I gained?
I'll give you a perfect example.
Why do you think you came rushing back here to check on a cough?
Because I care about Michelle.
But I cared about Michelle before I moved into this house.
Yeah, but before you moved into this house, the girls were just your nieces.
You stopped by four times a year to give them birthday and Christmas presents.
It's not like that anymore, is it?
Do you have any idea how important you are to those three girls?
Jesse, you have been there every time those girls have needed you.
Can you honestly tell me that you can just forget about the past seven months?
Just walk out of this house and go back to visits on birthdays and Christmas?
They do love me, don't they?
They really love me, don't they?
Well, fellas, can you blame them?
- Feels pretty good, doesn't it?
- I'm gonna tell you guys something.
But you better not tell any of my friends I said this.
I think I'm realizing that being part of this family is filling an empty an empty space in my heart that I didn't even know was there.
Jesse, we can make this easier for you.
You can take time for yourself whenever you need it.
Yeah, don't wait till it all builds up inside and you gotta run away from home again.
If you need to take off for a few days, fine.
We'll cover for you.
- Yeah, we'll make this work.
- Will you stay out of my room?
I'll try.
So Lassie's coming home?
Yeah, yeah.
Lassie's coming home.
- I gotta hug somebody.
- Me too.
Go nuts.
Hey, watch it.
- Sorry, kid.
- Uncle Jesse.
You're back, you're back, you're back.
D.J., get in here quick.
Uncle Jesse's back.
Our plan worked.
- Uncle Jesse, you're back.
- Hey.
Yeah, I was in the neighborhood, you know.
Are you here to stay or pick up your stuff and leave again?
Come here, girls.
Sit down.
Come here, D.J. I came back because I was worried about Michelle.
And because I missed you two guys.
No, I'm not going anywhere.
So does this mean you'll never leave again?
I can't promise you I'm gonna live here forever but what I can promise is I'm always gonna be your uncle.
And I'm always gonna be there when you two need me.
And I'm always gonna love you two knuckleheads very, very much.
- Cross your heart and hope to die?
- Pinkie swear.
He does mean business.
You're up.
Here.
I drove four hours in the freezing cold on my motorcycle behind a cattle truck to give you this.
Here you go.
Not impressed, are you?
Michelle, can I talk to you a second?
You know, when I first came here I thought I was just gonna move in for a few months just to help out and then get on with my life.
But you know what?
This is my life.
This is where I'm supposed to be right now.
Come here.
Do you realize, young lady, what you put me through tonight?
I was with the most incredible woman in the world.
Over two years old that is.
Sorry.
Anyway, from the moment I heard you were sick all I could do was think of this face.
What is it about this face, huh?
Good answer.
Good night, kid.
Can I get a kiss?
You know something, you little munchkin?
I love you.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
We're ready whenever you are, Steph.
Practice your show-and-tell.
Hi, boys and girls.
My name is Stephanie Tanner.
For show-and-tell today, I brought something cuddly, cute and adorable.
May I present my little baby sister, Michelle Tanner.
Michelle is a baby.
Her hobbies are drooling and babbling.
Under here is her diaper, which I'm not allowed to change.
But I've seen people do it and it's gross.
Any questions?
Yes, little girl?
Does Michelle have a big sister who's really cool?
Yes, she does.
Me.
That was wonderful.
Steph, if I had a gold star, I would stick it right to your forehead.
- Jesse.
- Hi, guys.
- Bye, guys.
- Wait a minute.
Jess, for the past five days, you've been sneaking in and out of this house carrying that blue bag, with not one word of explanation.
Uncle Jesse, it's driving me crazy.
Just answer one question.
Where do you go with that blue bag?
- Out.
- Out where?
Outside.
And that's two questions.
Goodbye.
Hello.
I love everyone.
I love you and you and you and you and you.
"I love you and you and you".
What's the matter with you?
Nothing.
I got a call from my mom this morning.
She found an old savings bond of mine in her safe deposit box.
And I now have - All right!
- Great!
Yeah!
Presents for everybody.
- Danny, get Michelle.
- All right.
Okay, you're first, my little toddlerette.
Here you go!
A little baby lawn mower.
Oh, mow yourself silly.
Now, if you're real good, next year you get the little baby weed whacker.
Okay, D.J., you're next.
I'm afraid all I have for you is just two brightly colored pieces of paper.
Thanks.
Oh, thanks!
This is so rad!
Springsteen tickets!
Yeah-- Hey, good seats.
Need a date?
Maybe.
What's in your bag?
Nice try.
- Me next!
Me next!
- Well, I'm sorry, Stephanie but all I have for you is a brand-new bicycle!
- Joey, you really shouldn't have.
- Yes, he should.
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
Wait a minute, Steph.
No riding in the house.
Hold on.
Steph!
- We'll try it out in the back yard.
- I can't stop, open the door.
Okay, guys, don't go away.
You got presents coming too.
All right!
Thank you.
I'm through with that.
Thanks.
Man, I hope Joey gets me a new motorcycle.
That would be cool.
- I already know what Joey's getting me.
- What's that?
Eight hundred dollars in cash.
Whoa, nice chunk of change.
Why?
Well, 11 years ago, I loaned Joey $800 to fix his car.
But he hasn't had the money to pay me back until now.
Better get it fast.
I don't want Joey's money.
The fact that he's finally paying me back is such a beautiful and touching gesture.
That's why I'm gonna give the $800 right back to him.
That's the most generous, stupid thing I've heard in my life.
I don't care what's in the bag.
No!
I shouldn't do it, should I, Michelle?
What if?
Look, Michelle.
I've got a cookie.
Yeah, you want the cookie?
They're yummy.
Want some cookie?
Yeah.
Come get the yummy cookie.
The cookie accidentally jumped into the bag.
Go find it!
Unzip the bag, Michelle.
Let's see what's in there.
Never mind the cookie.
Get the zipper open.
Let's see what Uncle Jesse's hiding in there.
You found it!
- May I help you?
- She did it.
Shame on you, Michelle.
You don't wanna grow up and be a nosy busybody, do you?
Your punishment is to give me one kiss.
Come on, one kiss.
Thanks for trying, Michelle.
Guys ready for your presents?
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.
I've been ready for 11 years.
- Here you go.
Jess and Danny.
- Thank you.
All right!
A pass to the Great American Amusement Park.
A lifetime pass.
All right, Danny, open yours.
Actually, I already kind of have a hunch what you got me.
A lifetime pass to the Great American Amusement Park?
Hey, we can double.
- See you, guys.
- See you.
Danny, wait till you see the pinball machine I bought.
You bought a pinball machine?
A genuine 1964 Gumby and Pokey pinball machine.
And the beauty part about it, I picked it up for a mere $1275.
Joey, this is why you're always broke.
Every time you have a nickel, you blow it.
Hey, come on, lighten up.
Joey, wait a minute.
Have you ever considered doing something with your money besides just throwing it away?
- Like what?
- Like putting it in a savings account.
Or buying a T-bill, paying off your old debts, investing.
Wait.
Hold on.
Back up.
You said old debts.
Danny, I don't have any old debts.
Be serious.
Who'd be stupid enough to lend me money?
Me.
Oh, yeah.
That's a good one.
When did I ever borrow money from you?
Palm Springs.
March 12, 1977.
Your car blows up again.
As usual, you're broke, so I loan you my last $800.
Oh, my God.
Danny, I completely forgot.
Why did you wait 11 years to say something?
I was gonna give you two more years.
Danny, look.
Here, just take the money back, with interest.
Take the whole ball.
I don't want it.
All I wanted was for you to offer.
Oh, sure.
That's why you brought up paying off debts.
Here.
- Joey, I want you to invest it.
- I am.
I'm investing it in getting you off my back.
- Off your back?
- Yes.
- I don't want it.
- I don't want it either.
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
You're a beautiful audience.
- Uncle Jesse.
- Hold your horses, mama.
I mean, hold on.
- I've got something to tell you.
- Hold on, please.
Please, hold on.
Come in.
Wanna come see me do my show-and-tell?
Girls, I'm very busy.
May I help you?
Jesse, can I talk to you about--?
- Jesse?
- Yes?
What's under your robe?
Daniel, you're entitled to know a lot of things about my life but what a man has under his robe is his own business.
Don't be cruel.
You're right.
What a man has under his robe is none of my business.
This is so cool.
I should have looked in that bag sooner.
All right.
Sit down.
I'm doing this tribute to the King.
The show is called "Rock & Roll Heaven".
I'm trying to save up money.
I got some new songs.
I wanna make demos.
It's only for a week.
I'm doing it tonight and that's it.
Why didn't you tell us?
I like to think of myself as having my own musical identity, you know?
I don't know.
I just feel-- I'm up there, I'm shaking, I'm wiggling.
- I gotta see this show.
- Me too.
Let's go!
No, it's not a good idea, you guys coming down there.
Jesse, we just wanna go there to cheer you on.
Don't worry, I promise nobody's gonna make fun of you.
Hey, Danny.
Don't forget, we're not gonna fight in front of the girls.
I'm sure if I forget, you'll remind me 11 years later.
Check it out, a Madonna look-alike.
No, honey, that's Marilyn Monroe.
Really?
Boy, did she rip off Madonna.
Thanks, Marilyn.
Great stuff.
And now "Rock & Roll Heaven" presents the king of rock 'n' roll!
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
You're beautiful.
I'd like to start off with one of my biggest records.
It's about this big.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much.
All right, hit it, fellas.
- Jesse was great, wasn't he?
- Girls, wasn't your Uncle Jesse great?
Thank you, thank you very much.
You're a beautiful audience.
Okay, it's time for all junior Elvi to say good night.
Thank you.
You're a beautiful audience.
Thank you very much.
Elvis has left the living room.
Aren't they cute?
- They're adorable.
- Adorably cute.
- Take your money.
- Will you stop it, Joey?
- Take the money.
- Knock it off.
- I can't believe you won't take it.
- Hello, boys.
Hi.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Guys, I'd like you to meet.
- I'm sorry, I didn't catch your real name.
- Marilyn.
There's a coincidence for you.
Marilyn, this is Larry, Moe, and the little one's Curly.
Get this, the show offered me the Elvis job for as long as I want or until I dislocate my hips.
- Hey, congratulations.
- Great.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
Thanks.
I don't know what I'm gonna do though, guys.
I mean, tell me something, Marilyn.
Doesn't it get to you, pretending to be Marilyn Monroe?
Pretending?
I am Marilyn Monroe, silly.
- Yeah.
- Fine.
Sure.
If you'll excuse us, Miss Monroe, we have to put the baby to bed.
By the way, I loved your work in Some Like it Hot.
I'm terribly sorry, but I've got to go now.
Thank you for stopping by, Marilyn.
Hey.
Are you going to call me?
- Yes, Marilyn.
- Okay.
It's in the book under M-O-N-R-O-E.
That's M-R-N-O-E-O-E?
Will you stop bothering me?
I am trying to make a sandwich.
I need a knife.
Knife.
Knife.
Joey, allow me to demonstrate how a mature adult constructs a sandwich.
Okay.
Go for it, Mr. Adult.
First, my friend, we start with a clean knife.
We take two slices of bread.
On the left slice, mayonnaise.
On the right slice, mustard.
- I'll bet you'll get another knife.
- Have to.
Another clean knife.
And then the mustard, we paint it on.
Now it's time for the ham and cheese.
And we alternate ham, cheese, ham, cheese.
So that in every bite, we have an equal amount of ham and cheese.
You don't need therapy, do you?
- Is that supposed to be funny?
- I knew you'd say that.
"I knew you'd say that"?
What is that supposed to mean?
It means that you're the most predictable person on the face of this earth.
I know everything you're gonna say even before you say it.
- Oh, do you?
- Oh, do you?
See?
You are so paint-by-the-numbers that even if the slightest little thing falls out of place, you can't handle it.
- That's not true.
- That's not true.
Well, let's just see how true it is.
Look at that crumb.
It's driving you nuts, isn't it?
- Doesn't bother me.
- Oh, no, doesn't bother you.
But what if?
There's two crumbs!
They're getting bigger and bigger and bigger.
Don't touch them.
They're alive!
This place is a pigsty.
Oh, sure.
Sure, make jokes.
Because everything is a joke to you, Mr. Comedian.
That's right.
You only go around once.
Might as well get all the smiles you can.
Smiles are great, but you are almost 30, and you still watch cartoons.
It's like living with Pee-wee Herman.
Well, sticks and stones may break my bones but names will never hurt me.
Joey.
Take this.
- You are such a baby.
- I know you are, but what am I?
Okay.
Let's settle this like we used to in the old days.
- Arm wrestling.
- Arm wrestling.
- I know everything you're gonna say.
- Fine.
Whoever loses keeps the $800.
Sounds fair to me.
- Okay.
One, two, three.
- One, two, three.
I can't remember the last time we did this.
- June 22, 1979.
- Why do you remember all this stuff?
I don't want the money back.
Stop it, I've had it with you.
I don't want it.
Guys, hold it!
There's something a little more important than what you're arguing about.
Me.
Fellas, I'm confused.
I don't know whether or not to take this Elvis gig or not.
I think I should probably concentrate on my own music, don't you?
I think you should take the job.
You need the money for your demo tape.
The only reason you should listen to him is if you lost a mitten when you were 4.
As for the job, hey, I saw you out there tonight.
You were singing songs that you love, just having a blast.
- That's why you should do it, for fun.
- He needs the money.
- For fun.
- For money.
For fun and money.
Thank you, guys.
That's good advice.
I think I'm gonna take the job.
Thanks.
- You're welcome.
- You're welcome.
- Don't say you're welcome.
- Don't say you're welcome.
I don't know what I'd do without you guys.
But I'm gonna look into it.
You know, that was good advice you gave Jesse.
Thanks, I thought yours was great too.
I think we really helped him.
Yeah, it's because we make a great team.
I guess that's why we've stayed friends for 19 years four months, and three days.
Because maybe I'm a little square.
And I'm a little goofy.
Know what?
Between the two of us, we make one hell of a guy.
That makes sense.
We've always been there for each other.
You were there when I needed that $800.
And you were there when I needed somebody to help take care of my kids.
I can never repay you for that.
You never need to.
Danny, look, a debt is a debt.
I just wanna clear ours up, so here.
Please take the money Okay.
Thank you.
But I'm buying you a savings bond and a closet organizer.
- No, you're not.
- It's my money now.
Make your bed.
No.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
- Oh, like you never do this.
- Not like that.
Check it out, D.J. I'm out of school tomorrow.
Really?
"Please excuse Kimmy from school.
Our family rabbit is having bunnies and we want Kimmy to share the miracle".
- Your mother wrote this?
- No.
My parents are in Vegas.
My big brother wrote it.
It cost me 20 bucks but I got the money from his wallet.
So this means you can go to the mini mall and get Stacey Q's autograph.
- Stacey Q. She's so rad.
- Stacey Q. She's so rad.
Hi.
What are you doing?
What are you talking about?
Can I play?
Hello?
Hello?
Steph, let me explain this one more time.
Your world is down here.
Our world is up here.
Okay, now can I play?
Girls, come on down and say goodbye.
Okay.
Here's a few phone numbers you might need while I'm down in L.A. Pediatrician, grandma police, fire department, the other grandma poison control, dentist.
You left off the White House and the equalizer.
Okay.
Maybe I'm overreacting.
It's just that it's my first night away from the girls overnight.
Bye, Dad.
- Bye.
We'll miss you.
- We'll miss you.
I'm gonna miss my girls.
I'll miss you.
I'll miss you.
I'll miss you.
I'll miss you.
Daddy take it easy.
You're hugging other people's kids.
Sorry, Kimmy.
Now, you all know that while I'm gone Uncle Jesse and Joey, they're gonna be in charge.
So you'll be on your best behavior, right?
- We won't let you down, Dad.
- Come on, girls.
Time for bed.
- Let's go.
- Let's go, girls.
Steph, let's go.
Come on.
Uncle Jesse, can I stay up Absolutely not.
Bye-bye, honey.
Dad, before you go you wouldn't mind if I got an autograph of my favorite singer, Stacey Q, would you?
No, not at all.
Great.
You're the best dad.
Just sign this note excusing me from school tomorrow and have a wonderful trip.
Nice try, D.J. Oh, come on, Dad.
You just said I could have the autograph.
I'd only be missing one day of school.
I'm sorry.
I'll make it up.
I'll go to school on Christmas.
D.J., we all have our jobs.
My job is to go to L.A. and cover a surfing competition.
Your job is to go to school.
Kimmy gets to go.
Why can't I?
Because you're not Kimmy.
I don't know why Kimmy's missing school but there's a lot of things about Kimmy that I don't understand.
If I don't get this autograph, I'll die.
D.J., no one has ever died from lack of autograph.
I really gotta go.
Now, come on, give your father a big hug.
Goodbye, Father.
Come here, daughter.
Give your dad a hug.
Have a good time.
- See you tomorrow afternoon.
- Sorry, D.J.
This isn't over yet.
Oh, God, that's horrible.
I loved it.
Really?
I could be wrong.
I think you're so talented.
You're charming, good-looking, funny.
Great head of hair.
Okay, what do you want?
By the way, whatever it is, you got it.
Can I interview you?
I have an essay to do on the person I admire most.
And, of course, I picked you.
Well, yes.
Yes.
Sure.
Here.
Sit.
Go.
Be.
Do.
Well, it all started about 150 years ago with my great-great-grandfather Spiro.
Uncle Jesse, let's skip ahead to your life.
I bet you were pretty wild as a little kid, huh?
D.J., you might say I was a rebel munchkin.
In fact, you know, my coloring book.
I used to color on the outside of the lines.
On purpose.
- You were bad.
- You bet.
I bet you got away with all kinds of stuff.
You probably ditched school a lot, huh?
Well.
Not a lot, but once in a while.
Not that I'm proud of it but I was the best.
Not that I'm proud of that, either.
I remember this one time I'm particularly not proud of.
I was dying to see the Rolling Stones farewell concert.
It was either their fifth or their sixth.
It was their sixth.
Get to the ditching part, please.
Oh, sure.
Well, what happened was, I just ran your basic sick scam.
You know, I mean, I said I had a fever, and cold hands and red eyes.
And, of course, those two magical words: I'm sick.
Slow down.
I can't write that fast.
Oh, I'm sorry.
That's "I'm sick".
Five I's.
There you go.
Good.
See, meantime, I tell my mom, you know, "I really wanna go to school".
But she calls me in sick anyway.
So then how'd you go to the concert?
Here comes the genius of your Uncle J. What I did was 10 minutes later, I convinced my mom that I'm all better.
So she sends me to school.
And since she already called the school.
They weren't expecting me.
And you were free to get the autograph.
I mean, to go to the concert.
- Thanks, Uncle Jesse.
- Sure.
Anyway, after the concert-- What is this?
That's the end of the interview?
No.
What's your favorite color?
- Black.
- Thank you.
A hundred and six.
Hospital.
A hundred and four.
Doctor.
A hundred and one.
Out of school.
- What's wrong?
- I'm sick.
Poor baby.
I'll get Joey.
You just need some peace and quiet.
Joey, get in here!
Get in here!
- What is it?
What's wrong?
- She's sick.
I'll get you some juice, D.J. I wish I could get you Stacey Q's autograph.
D.J., you're burning up.
You have a fever, 101.
A hundred and one?
Let me see.
D.J., your hands feel like icicles.
They do.
But, Joey, I have to go to school today.
There's a big test on C-- C-- Canada.
You want to go to school?
You must be really sick.
I'm calling school right now.
I am so rad.
Michelle, you're doing a great job.
Yeah.
Tomorrow I'm gonna show you how to vacuum.
- Hi, Joey.
- What are you doing out of bed?
My hands are warm, my head is cool.
I can go to school.
Freeze.
Move it.
I need to see your license, registration and forehead.
You feel fine.
How can that possibly be?
It's a miracle.
No, the miracle would be is if I fell for this.
I know exactly what's going on.
- Oh, no.
You do?
- What do you think, I'm an idiot?
It's obvious.
You felt so guilty about getting out of that test with that phony sick bit you finally broke down and decided to go to school.
That's exactly right.
Boy, I can't fool you.
No, you really can't, Deej.
You're a classy kid.
I'm proud of you.
Right.
Well, I'm off to school to take that test.
No speeding.
Michelle, your daddy is gonna be very happy when he sees the way that I'm handling things.
Here you go.
No, Michelle.
I wash.
You dry.
- We gotta be cool.
- Hi.
- She's so rad!
- She's so rad!
- Thanks for coming down.
- You're welcome, Miss Q. Stacey.
Who should I make these out to?
I'm Kimmy.
Two M's, a Y, an I and a K. But not in that order.
And you can make mine to D.J. "The girl who's like a sister to me, who I'll take to the Grammy Awards".
Or just "To D.J." Here you go, girls.
- See you soon.
- She wants to be our friend.
- Look at mine.
- Look at her hair.
Her jacket.
It's Joey!
Oh, hide, hide.
Go.
What's the matter?
You want down?
Okay.
Don't buy too many Chipmunk CDs.
No, no, no.
Go back to Joey.
No.
Go away.
Go.
Go.
Go get Benny.
Take it to Joey.
Go get Benny.
Go pick up Benny.
Take it to Joey.
Good, good.
Now, go take it to Joey.
He's over there.
Go, go.
Take it to Joey.
I don't believe it.
I taught her this game.
Come here, Michelle.
Come here.
Can you save my place?
I gotta get my baby.
My little baby.
It's not really even my baby.
You don't care.
Go find Joey.
You found Joey.
D.J.?
What are you doing here?
Getting busted.
What are you doing here?
I was so impressed with your honesty that I came down here to get you an autograph.
D.J., this is not cool.
I trusted you.
Give me that autograph.
Come on.
Let's go.
We're going home.
This is so humiliating.
You know, Michelle, it's a shame kids have to grow up.
I mean, why can't they stay like you, so sweet, so innocent.
So ladylike.
Joey, what's the emergency?
D.J. cut school to get Stacey Q's autograph.
I left work early for that?
Joseph, do you realize I was this close to finally figuring out where that line of ants actually begins?
How you doing, kid?
She did more than cut school, Jess.
She completely faked me out.
You?
No.
Jesse, this plan was diabolical.
She faked the flu.
I called in sick for her.
Then boom, she's better, and she takes off, just like that.
The conniving little sneak.
Oh, Joey, she's not a conniving little sneak.
I gave her that plan.
You what?
Well, she was interviewing me for her essay on the person she admires most.
There's no essay.
That conniving little sneak.
Danny's gone.
We're in charge.
Now, what are we gonna do?
All right, let's think about this.
See, when I was a kid and I got in trouble, my dad showed me no mercy.
He took so many privileges away, that to this day, when I go visit my parents I gotta go straight to my room.
No TV, no dinner.
Well, whenever I was bad, my dad would sit me down talk about right and wrong, and good and bad for hours and hours, on and on until finally I just beat the hell out of myself.
The worst part, though, the worst part was when my dad gave me the "dad" face.
You know, it was-- It was like this: The "dad" face.
That's good.
Let me try it.
No, no, Joey.
That's the I-just-ate-bad-chili face.
You don't have to do that.
I feel bad enough.
I'm really sorry.
I totally blew it.
I'll never do anything like this again.
Regardless, but Joseph and I must deal with your misconduct, young lady.
Misconduct?
Young lady?
I really am turning into my father.
If I start wearing a white belt and shoes to match, throw me down the stairs.
I'd be honored.
D.J., we're gonna have to punish you.
So no TV for two weeks.
What, you call that punishment?
No TV, no music for two weeks.
Oh, yeah?
I see your no TV and no music for two weeks and I raise you no friends over for a month.
I call.
No TV, no music and no friends over for a month.
Are we agreed, young lady?
Sure.
I deserve to be punished.
Dad trusted me, and I let him down.
I hate myself.
Excuse us.
Listen, man, I think the kid is sorry.
I mean, she's been punished.
I think when Danny comes back from L.A maybe we shouldn't tell him about this.
Don't you think he has a right to know.
But we don't want him to think we can't take care of them.
You're absolutely right.
I forgot about that.
- He may never wanna leave again.
- Good thinking.
All right.
D.J., we're not gonna tell your dad what happened.
Well, all right.
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you.
"The bunny and the ducky and the turtle and the frog all rode home on a rainbow.
And smiled for the rest of their lives".
- I love this story.
- Yeah.
See.
Cowabunga, dudes.
- Hi, Dad.
- Hey.
Hey.
I missed my little dudettes.
Let me "dudette" again.
L.A. claims another victim.
- How did everything go here?
- Great.
Yeah, it's fine.
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi.
D.J., you look so much better.
You look so much better?
Yeah.
I got my hair done.
You got gypped.
I thought you were sick.
Right.
Sick of this hairstyle.
That's good.
Steph, walk with me.
Talk with me.
Listen.
How about if we play a game entitled "Let's not talk about D.J.," okay?
Okay.
Anybody wanna play "Let's not talk about D.J."?
See, now you've lost the game.
Your punishment is that you have to go into the kitchen and cook us dinner.
I don't know how to cook.
Polish the silver.
Why are we not talking about D.J.?
Was D.J. sick this morning?
Well, she was a little under the weather, but we got her right back on her feet - and shipped her right to school.
- Exactly.
See, it was hardly worth mentioning, so we didn't mention it.
Everything is great.
Oh.
Well, good.
D.J., since you missed school today your teacher asked me to give you your homework.
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.
Now, see, that's a good "dad" face right there.
Donna Jo.
I tricked Uncle Jesse into teaching me how to fool Joey into thinking I was sick so I could cut school to get that autograph.
But then Michelle busted me, and Joey took me home on a leash.
You liar.
You made me a liar too.
I lied to Joey, to your teacher and everybody.
I thought I knew you, but I don't.
I share my rinse cup with a stranger.
- Stephanie-- - I even made you a get-well card.
Here.
Get well.
D.J., go wait for me upstairs.
- Joey, I'm starting to feel hungry.
- Me too.
- Guys, come back.
- I'm not that hungry.
No, me neither.
I wanna know everything that goes on in my daughters' lives.
I don't expect you to be perfect parents, but I do expect you to be honest.
I don't know why-- I don't know why-- I don't know why I'm wagging my finger at you like this.
Look.
I don't wanna lecture you guys.
I'd be lost here without you.
But did you have to lie to me?
We didn't want you to think we couldn't handle things.
We wanted you to know you could go and everything would be cool with your kids.
If there's a problem, we should get it out in the open.
That's right.
We should work things out together as a family.
In fact, Joey, say you're sorry and mean it.
- I'm sorry.
Now you say it.
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.
Okay?
- Okay.
- Thanks for the talk.
- Yeah.
- Steph, what are you doing?
- I'm making a get-sick card.
I said I was sorry.
Lecture time.
See you.
Steph, I think you should stay.
Why do I get a lecture?
I didn't do anything.
But you will, so take accurate notes.
D.J., come over here.
Why did you do what you did today?
Because I wanted that autograph more than anything.
Do you know what the worst part is about what you did?
- That I cut school?
- No.
That you tricked Stephanie?
That you were selfish.
All you cared about was D.J. You did whatever you had to do to get D.J. what she wanted even if it meant lying and hurting other people.
I don't wanna be selfish.
And I don't wanna hurt other people's feelings.
I know you don't.
I think you really care about other people.
I'm really sorry, Dad.
Well I know next time you'll think things through a lot more carefully.
Because you're a lot better than what I saw today.
Come here.
Daddy, am I your favorite now?
- Yes.
- Hey.
No, no.
No matter what happens, I'm always gonna love all three of you exactly the same.
Oh, all right.
I wish Michelle was here.
I like her the best.
- Hey.
- Hey.
