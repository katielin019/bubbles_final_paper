{START OF EPISODE 1}
I've always wondered why baseball is so associated with sex.
"He's playing the field.
He scored.
He didn't get to first base.
" "I struck out.
" "Why"?
"She wanted a diamond.
" It's always baseball, always baseball.
As far as baseball goes, I prefer the fat umpires.
If you're on the field and not in the game you should be in the worst physical condition a human could be in.
They should be allowed to eat during the game.
We're too into sports in this country.
We gotta throttle back.
People come home from these games: "We won, we won"!
No, they won, you watched.
Okay, Danny.
Take a swing.
No, no, no.
- You're opening up your shoulder.
- Really?
No, not really.
I'm just saying this to you because I like to hear myself talk.
Yes, really.
All right, all right.
- What are you all sweating for?
- It's hot in this uniform.
- Hot?
What is this?
- What is what?
This uniform.
What's it made from?
- I don't know.
Cotton?
- No.
No, no.
This is not cotton.
Here, let me see.
- What are you doing?
- I wanna see the label.
Will you stop it?
Come on.
- Oh, of course.
Polyester!
- So?
- I can't believe you're not in cotton.
- This is what they give us.
You know they used to make leisure suits out of this fabric?
- You really think cotton is better?
- Of course.
All right, maybe I'll say something to Buck.
- Yeah, good idea.
Catch you later.
- Yeah.
Hey, don't embarrass me today.
I got some friends in the stands.
- Hot dogs here.
Yankee franks.
- Oh, you want one?
- Yeah.
- I'll get it.
- I got it.
- Jerry.
- Elaine, stop it.
- Just because I'm not working doesn't mean I don't have any money.
Yo.
Dogs.
Two.
All right.
I'm sorry.
Your attention, please.
The New York Yankees would like to welcome Miss Connecticut Miss Rhode Island and Miss North Dakota.
All of whom will be competing in the Miss America pageant this weekend in Atlantic City.
Now, there's a career path you may have overlooked.
Oh, I gotta check my machine.
I'm waiting to hear about an interview.
Doubleday is looking for somebody to replace Jackie Onassis.
- She worked at Doubleday?
- Yeah, she was an editor.
- Oh, right, just like you.
- Yeah.
- Would you move your feet?
- Yeah.
- Hey, lady!
- Hey, down in front!
- Hey!
- Move your feet.
- I'm going.
- Come on.
- Hot dog?
- No, thanks.
- I'm watching my weight.
- I'm watching my height.
My doctor doesn't want me to get any taller.
- So you're Miss..
?
- Rhode Island.
I was almost Mr. Coffee.
They felt I was a little too relaxed.
Miss Rhode Island?
- When are you seeing her?
- Tonight.
I have to call her.
She's staying in a hotel.
- You're incredible.
- And get this: I'm working Atlantic City this weekend.
She's gonna be there for the pageant.
What if she becomes Miss America?
You could be dating Miss America.
The only bad thing is we have to go out with a chaperone.
Chaperone?
What, are you kidding?
- No.
It's the contest rules.
- What does the chaperone do?
I don't know.
She just sits there.
- Can she talk?
- I'm not sure if she's allowed to talk.
- Are you calling her?
- Yeah.
Yes.
Room 417, please.
Karen Hanson.
Hey, did you know the Yankees don't wear cotton jerseys?
Of course.
They're polyester.
Well, what is that?
That's a crime.
You know how hot those things get?
They should be wearing cotton.
- Why do they wear polyester?
- I don't know.
That's all gonna change.
- You're gonna do something about it?
- Why shouldn't I?
No reason.
Of course, Jackie O was a great lady.
Those are gonna be some tough shoes to fill.
Everyone loved her.
She had such grace.
- Yes!
- Grace!
- Not many people have grace.
Well, you know, grace is a tough one.
I like to think I have a little grace.
- Not as much as Jackie O, but - You can't have a little grace.
You either have grace or you don't.
Okay, fine.
I have no grace.
And you can't acquire grace.
Well, I have no intention of getting grace.
Grace isn't something you can pick up at the market.
All right, look.
I don't have grace, I don't want grace I don't even say grace, okay?
- Thank you for coming in.
- Yeah, yeah, right.
We'll make our choice in a few days and we'll let you know.
- I have no chance, do I?
- No.
All right.
Thanks.
Justin Pitt to see you.
- Justin Pitt?
- He was a very close friend of Mrs. Onassis'.
Mrs. Onassis'.
That's hard to pronounce.
- Excuse me?
- Nothing, nothing.
Mrs. Landis, there's something wrong with this copying machine.
It's all coming out slanted.
Now, I don't know if this is your department or not.
Justin Pitt, this is Elaine Benes.
Charmed.
I was a great admirer of Mrs. Onassis.
Hello, Karen?
Hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld.
Oh, that's very sweet of you.
You better be careful.
You don't wanna get too congenial.
They'll slap that Miss Congeniality on you you'll congenial yourself right out of the contest.
So, what time you wanna get together later?
What?
So what?
We don't need the chaperone.
Her chaperone can't make it.
Oh, you're not gonna get disqualified.
So we're not going?
Come on.
Hold on one second.
- Hey, what are you doing tonight?
- Nothing.
I'm going out with a Miss America contestant.
You wanna go?
What state?
Rhode Island.
They're never in contention.
How do you know?
Because I've seen every Miss America pageant since I was 6.
Do you wanna go or not?
I'll buy you dinner.
- Giddyup.
- I think I got someone.
The resemblance is uncanny.
Even the brown eyes.
Well, a lot of people have brown eyes.
No, there's something else.
An indefinable quality.
Grace?
Grace, yes.
You think I have grace?
- Some grace, yes.
- Just some?
Well, you don't want too much grace, or you won't be able to stand.
Oh, Mr. Pitt.
Elaine, I want you to come and work for me as my personal assistant.
Now, I'll pay you the same as Pendant but I would need you to start right away.
Hey, Buck.
Talk to you for a second?
Sure, George.
How's everything going?
Everything okay?
Well, all of a sudden, there's a problem with Tartabull's swing, but Listen, Buck, obviously I don't need to talk to you about the importance of player morale.
But I've been talking to some of the guys I don't wanna mention any names, but some of them aren't too happy with the polyester uniforms.
- How so?
- They get very hot in the polyester.
It's not a natural fiber.
I think they would prefer cotton.
- Cotton, huh?
- Cotton breathes.
See, it's much softer.
Imagine playing games and your team is 5 degrees cooler than the other team.
Don't you think that would be an advantage?
They're cooler, they're more comfortable, they're happier they're gonna play better.
- You may have something there.
- Oh, I've got something.
Cotton uniforms.
Congratulations.
Yeah.
And the best part is I still get to look for work in publishing.
- Now, what is it that you do, exactly?
- I attend to his personal affairs.
Like what?
Well, like tomorrow, for example, I - I have to buy him some socks.
- Really?
- Socks.
- Yeah.
White ones.
The ones you wear with sneakers.
Maybe you could pick me up some underwear.
So, what do you think?
Does this work?
Listen, tonight, after we finish eating you make like you got something else to do and recede into the night, if you know what I mean.
No way.
- What?
- If you think I'm gonna step aside while you defile this woman, you're crazy.
I'm not going to defile her.
Right, because I'm gonna see it doesn't happen.
These girls are Miss America contestants.
It's every little girl's dream.
I'm not gonna let you trample that dream and make a mockery of everything the pageant stands for.
No buts.
- Those are my rules.
- Wait a minute.
If you wanna have some good, wholesome fun with a nice girl I'll help you out.
If you're looking for something more you got the wrong guy, buddy.
- It's just If you were Miss America what would you do to make the world a better place?
As Miss America I would try and bring an end to world hunger.
If every person sacrificed one meal a week there would be enough to feed the whole world.
That's a hell of a plan.
Listen What advice would you give young people?
All right, Kramer.
This is important.
She's gotta be able to answer these questions.
She's not gonna have time to think with millions of people watching her.
Any hesitation could cost her the crown.
You know, poise counts.
- You really know a lot about this.
- Yeah, like last year Miss Texas should have won easily.
But she lost points in the swimsuit competition.
- What could she have done?
- Tape her breasts together.
- What else?
- All right, take you for example.
Now, you're very attractive, but you got a big waist.
- Hey, come on!
- No, no, no, it's okay.
- Go on.
- Well I'd recommend a waist cincher.
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.
Just suck you in.
All right.
I'll be right back.
- So, what's your talent?
- Magic.
I'm thinking of a number from one to 10.
Six.
No, five.
But you were close.
And the Yankees take the field.
Is it my imagination or the Yankees look a little different tonight?
- I can't put my finger on it.
- From what I understand they switched to cotton uniforms.
Well, they say it's softer.
Well, it is a natural fiber.
How's your eveningwear?
- Well, I'm wearing this red - Stop right there.
- No good?
- Disaster.
- Why?
- Well, you got brown eyes.
- You wanna wear a green dress.
- That makes sense.
Well, here we are.
Kramer, would you consider being my personal consultant for the pageant?
Okay.
But if I'm gonna do this we play by my rules or we don't play at all.
I am in your hands.
Well Good night, Jerry.
- Kenneth will take you home.
- Yeah.
Oh, shut the **** up.
- Hey.
- Well, if it isn't Mr. Blackwell.
Oh, come on.
And that waist cincher, that was the topper.
- Oh, you're pooh-poohing?
- Yes, I pooh-pooh.
Well, let me tell you something.
I'm taking this kid to the top.
To the top, Jerry.
We're going for the crown, and you can't stop her.
- I don't wanna stop her.
- You can't stop her, Jerry!
Oh, I've seen them come and go, but this kid has got something.
Yeah, so do you.
- Well, did you see it?
- See what?
The uniforms!
Did you see how they played?
Listen to these comments.
"Wade Boggs, 'What a fabric.
Finally, we can breathe.
' Luis Polonia, 'Cotton is king.
' Paul O'Neill, 'I never dreamed anything could be so soft and fluffy.
"' - Boy, they really sound comfortable.
- Hey, where you going?
- I'm working Atlantic City.
- Really?
Hey, you're not working.
Why don't you come down.
Atlantic City?
Yes.
Yes.
I will go to Atlantic City.
I'm in.
I'm down.
Maybe Elaine wants to go too.
Let me call her.
She's at Mr. Pitt's.
I think I got the number.
So, what do you think?
- No.
- What..
?
- You don't like them?
- No, I don't like them.
- What's wrong?
- They're too tight.
- Too tight?
- There's no elastic.
You need to pull too much.
I think they look good.
They're cutting off the circulation.
All right.
I'll take them back.
- Hello?
- Hi, Mr. Pitt.
Is Elaine there?
It's for you.
Sorry.
- Hello?
- Hey, Elaine, it's me.
- Jerry.
- Yeah.
We're going to Atlantic City.
- Really?
When?
- Today.
Right now.
You in?
One second, one second.
Hang on, hang on.
Excuse me, Mr. Pitt.
Would it be all right if I got the socks tomorrow?
- Tomorrow?
- Yes.
I was hoping for my new socks today.
- Well, it's just one more day.
- I'm sorry.
I must have them today.
I can't go.
- Why not?
- Because I have to return the socks and get different ones.
- Elaine!
I gotta go.
No.
All right, watch me.
Turn.
Back.
Head up.
Shoulders back.
- Posture.
See?
Posture.
- Yes, I see.
Okay.
All right, let's try a few more questions.
All right?
"If you were Miss America and the U.S. was on the brink of a nuclear war and the only way the conflict could be averted was if you agreed to sleep with the enemy's leader what would you do"?
Kramer, are these questions really that important?
Yes, they're important!
If you stumble, if you hesitate, you can kiss the crown goodbye.
Now, if I told you once, I've told you a thousand times, poise counts!
It's just as important as the others.
Swimsuit, eveningwear, talent, poise!
- Hey.
How was the show?
- Good.
How was roulette?
I won 50 bucks.
This is great.
Too bad Elaine's not here.
Yeah.
All she had to do was buy Mr. Pitt a pair of socks.
- It's good, but - But what?
- Ultimately, I don't think they'll stay up.
- No.
No, they'll stay up.
For a while, yes, but not in the long run.
But that's why I got you the tighter ones.
Forget about those!
- Why do you keep mentioning those?
- What do you want?
I want a decent sock that's comfortable that will stay on my foot!
- What the hell is that?
- I don't know.
It sounds like pigeons.
- Well, I can't sleep with that noise.
- Me either.
Is there anything you can do to shut them up?
Wait a second.
This will scare them off.
- Well, good night, Ollie.
- Good night, Stan.
- What is it?
- My doves.
They're dead.
I trained those birds for eight years.
How am I supposed to do my magic act now?
- How did this happen?
- They like it outside so I kept them in a cage on the terrace then I found them dead in a pool of water.
- But how did this happen?
- It must have been an accident.
Accident?
This was no accident.
These doves were murdered.
Well, that's it.
She's out of the pageant.
- What?
Why?
What happened?
- Her birds are dead.
- Birds?
- Yeah, birds.
She's got these trained doves.
She does a magic act.
That was her talent for the pageant.
You know what I think, Jerry?
I think somebody murdered those doves.
Somebody wanted her out of that contest bad.
Somebody who was just eaten up with jealousy.
Somebody who couldn't stand to have the spotlight taken off of them.
What are you looking at?
Oh, that.
We We had to leave that outside last night because the water was making the room too cold.
That's - You killed them.
- No.
You don't understand.
It's not what you think.
It was an accident.
Don't think that you've won, because you haven't.
This kid is a fighter.
And if you think I'm gonna let a couple of dead birds get in our way you're crazy!
- Kramer, you gotta What was that all about?
Oh, it was just Kramer.
Apparently I killed Miss Rhode Island's doves with the bucket of water last night.
Ladies and gentlemen, that was Miss Texas.
Wasn't she wonderful?
And now, continuing with the talent portion of the competition - Okay, this is it.
- How you feeling?
- I'm a little nervous.
- There's nothing to be nervous about.
But I've never sung before in my life.
And now, let's welcome Karen Ann Hanson Miss Rhode Island.
I heard those doves were really incredible.
That's a shame.
It's like watching an animal get tortured.
- Hey, hey.
Yankee game.
- Oh, great.
All right.
And the Yankees take the field.
What is with the Yankees?
They look like they're having trouble running.
- They can't move.
- It's their uniforms.
They're too tight.
They've shrunk.
They're running like penguins.
Forget this game.
Oh, my God, Mattingly just split his pants.
That's a shame.
Poise.
Poise.
The Miss America pageant seems like a really tough contest.
You come out there in the bathing suit and the dress shoes.
They got that sanitized-for-your-protection toilet-seat thing hanging off them, you know?
Plus, they gotta wear all the other outfits.
I don't know why.
The bathing suit is the contest.
You win the bathing suit, you win.
Everybody looks good in formalwear.
It's dark, it covers everything.
That's why we have weddings in it.
If we had weddings in bathing suits a lot of ceremonies wouldn't get past: "If anyone sees any reason why these two people should not be joined together " About 80 hands go up.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
I find it fascinating, when you go in the stationery store that they're manufacturing millions of pens constantly.
We're all buying them.
I must have bought 6000 Bics in my life.
I've used up maybe two of them.
Where's the rest of them?
Move a refrigerator, there's a couple there.
But that doesn't account for it.
Where are all the pens?
That's why it's embarrassing if you don't have one.
"You got a pen?
Can I borrow a pen"?
We always have to whisper because it's so humiliating.
"I don't have a pen.
" "They're making millions of them every week.
" "I know.
Where are they"?
May I help you?
Yeah, hi.
I'm looking for a Rolamech 1000.
- It's a mechanical pencil.
- Oh, I know the Rolamech 1000.
No, I'm sure you do.
They're pretty expensive.
Well, it's for my boss.
What do you do?
Whatever.
Well, we don't have any in stock right now but I would be happy to order it for you.
Just give me your phone number and when it comes in, I'll give you a call.
Your name is..
?
Elaine.
Elaine.
- And your last name?
- It's just Elaine.
Like Cher.
And your number?
It's KL5-2390.
Okay.
Thanks a lot.
- You'll be hearing from me.
- Okay.
So long.
- Why did you give him my number?
- Don't worry about it.
I think he got ideas.
I wonder if any woman ever said that about Einstein.
Just call me when the pencil comes in.
Why does Mr. Pitt prefer a pencil to a pen anyway?
Hey, look who's here.
Hey.
- Hi, Jerry.
- Hi, Julie.
Elaine, Julie.
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.
Elaine's my middle name.
Mine's Ike.
Hey, wanna get some lunch?
Just had a big bowl of Kix.
Oh, well, that's very mature.
- What about you?
- Oh, please come, Elaine.
No.
Maybe you could bring me back something.
- Sure, all right.
What do you want?
- I don't know.
- A big salad.
- What big salad?
- I'm going to the coffee shop.
- They have big salads.
I've never seen a big salad.
They have big salads.
Is that what I ask for, the big salad?
- It's okay.
Just forget it.
- No, hey, I'll get it.
What's in the big salad?
Big lettuce, big carrots.
Tomatoes like volleyballs.
So you gonna be upstairs?
See you in a little while.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Maybe I should just get married.
Dating really is getting embarrassing, isn't it?
I know.
Whenever I'm on a date, I always feel like people can tell.
People on dates shouldn't be allowed out in public.
It's embarrassing for them.
It's painful for us to watch.
I'm going out with someone later, I'm not even taking her out.
- Good for you.
- I don't need people staring at us.
You're telling me.
What was that?
Gendason.
What a jerk.
I'm never playing golf with him again.
- Who?
Gendason?
- Steve Gendason.
Why does that name sound so familiar?
- He used to be a baseball player.
- How'd you end up golfing with him?
I met him on the course a couple years ago.
Yeah.
Played with him a lot.
But today was it.
We're on the 15th hole.
He's beating me by a couple of strokes.
Then he's about to hit his second shot when he picks up the ball and cleans it.
- So what?
- Sorry.
The rules clearly state you cannot clean the ball unless it's on the green.
- The rules are clear about that.
- Certainly are.
- So I penalized him a stroke.
- So, what happened?
He lost it!
We almost came to blows.
We're face to face, like a manager and an umpire.
We're like, "Hey, what are you talking about?
!
- Think I'm gonna put up with that"?
!
- All right.
All right!
You're in my face.
I don't see what the big deal is.
Hey, a rule is a rule.
And let's face it, without rules, there's chaos.
I like Anna Quindlen's column.
And Safire.
Don't you like Safire?
Safire.
Although at times he can be rather pedantic.
He can be pedantic.
He can be pedantic.
And Bob Herbert's great.
He worked for the Daily News.
Yes.
Yes.
You know what's interesting?
The quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons is Bobby Hebert, no R which I find fascinating.
You know, it's Herbert H- E-R-B-E-R-T Hebert, H-E-B-E-R-T.
Hebert.
It's a fun name to pronounce.
Try and say it.
Hebert.
Go ahead, take a shot.
Hebert.
All right.
- Thanks.
I got it.
- No.
I'd like to pay.
Now, Julie, Julie, don't insult me.
What difference does it make who pays?
It's meaningless.
- Okay, thanks, George.
- Here's your big salad to go.
Oh, thank you.
Hello.
No, she's not here.
Okay, fine.
Whatever.
Yes, I'll tell her.
Okay, goodbye.
Stationery-store guy called to say he ordered your pencil.
I told you.
He has ideas.
He doesn't even care if a man answers.
Or you.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Hey.
- Sorry we're late.
- It's no problem.
- Here's your big salad.
- Thank you, Julie.
You're very welcome.
So I guess I better get going.
Meeting Mother at the Guggenheim.
You don't wanna go?
No, you Guggenheim.
I'm not much of a Guggenheimer.
- You sure?
- Yeah, yeah.
You go.
- Okay, I'll see you later.
Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.
Did you see what just happened here?
Well, that all depends.
Did you happen to notice that Julie handed the big salad to Elaine?
- Yeah, so?
- Well, she didn't buy the big salad.
I bought the big salad.
- Is that a fact?
- Yes, it is.
She just took credit for my salad.
- That's not right.
- No, it isn't.
- I'm the one who bought it.
- You did.
- She should've said something.
- She could have.
- Oh, I know.
- Imagine her taking credit for your big salad.
You buy a big salad for somebody, it would be nice if they knew it.
Obviously.
- Turn on the TV.
- What?
Put it on.
Put it on!
Neither the district attorney's office nor the police department have answered any questions as yet.
To repeat, in case you're just joining us former baseball star Steve Gendason has been taken to police headquarters for questioning in the murder of Bobby Pinkus, the owner of Royal Dry Cleaners at 2759 Amsterdam Avenue.
According to Pinkus' wife Gendason had been involved in a dispute with the cleaner over a stain on a pair of gray Sansabelt slacks.
We also have a report that earlier in the day a groundskeeper at Van Cortlandt golf course reportedly saw an irate Gendason leaving the clubhouse in a huff.
Whether there is a possible connection between the two is something we'll just have to wait and find out.
- Jerry.
- Well, it had nothing to do with you.
Yeah, but maybe he was so mad from the penalty stroke that he murdered the dry cleaner.
Generally speaking, you don't need any extra incentive to murder a dry cleaner.
I wouldn't worry about it.
- I like Julie.
She's very personable.
- Yeah, she's lovely.
- That's great, George.
- Yeah.
- So did you enjoy your lunch?
- Yeah.
The big salad.
It was very good.
Actually, it was too big.
- Why?
- Oh, no reason.
Because, you know, she handed you the bag.
I could have handed you the bag.
But she happened to picked it up at the restaurant, even though Even though what?
It's just You thanked her, even though What's the difference?
What?
What are you trying to say, George?
It's just that I was the one that actually paid for the big salad.
She just happened to hand it to you.
But it's no big deal.
You want the money for the big salad, George?
- No, no.
- Then what is your problem?
There is no problem.
Just a small miscommunication whereby you thanked her instead of the person actually responsible for the purchasing of the big salad.
Kramer played golf with him, and Kramer thinks a penalty stroke may have driven him to it.
Well, they haven't even arrested him yet.
Come on.
Let's go out.
No, I don't think so.
Why not?
We don't need a bunch of people staring at us.
- Who's staring?
- Oh, they're staring.
They know we're on a date.
They're making fun.
Come on.
It's embarrassing.
Hello?
No, she's not here.
Yes, I will tell her.
No, I don't know what time she might be coming back.
Look, I gotta go.
Bye.
That's It's a long story.
Hello, Newman.
Hello, Jerry.
I was wondering if you knew where Kramer was.
- No, I don't.
Why?
You know, Gendason.
This is something, isn't it?
- I suppose.
- What did Kramer say?
- I don't know.
Nothing.
- Come on, Jerry.
You know something.
Tell me!
Tell me!
Oh, Chunkys.
Margaret?
- Hello.
- You two know each other?
You might say that.
We used to go out.
Well, toodle-loo.
Nice seeing you again, Margaret.
Bye, Jerry.
Have fun.
You went out with Newman?
- Just a few times.
- Why?
- I liked him.
- You liked Newman?
Look, I'm a little uncomfortable talking about this, okay?
No, I'm sorry.
I'm just a little curious.
Why did you stop seeing him?
He ended it.
He ended it?
Yes.
Yes.
It was a couple of years ago.
Why, does it matter?
No.
No, of course not.
Jerry, they found a tee.
- What tee?
- A golf tee in the dry cleaner.
Newman.
She went out with Newman.
- It must be a mistake.
- No.
It isn't.
And the most distressing part is not that she went out with him but that he stopped seeing her.
Do you understand?
He, Newman Newman stopped seeing her.
Newman never stops seeing anybody.
Newman will see whoever is willing to see him.
So the question, then, is not so much why did she see him as disturbing as that is but why did he, Newman, stop seeing her?
Perhaps there's more to Newman than meets the eye.
No.
There's less.
- It's possible.
- No, it isn't.
I've looked into his eyes.
He's pure evil.
Maybe he's an enigma.
A mystery wrapped in a riddle.
Yeah.
He's a mystery wrapped in a Twinkie.
- Can I get you some more coffee?
- No, but thank you.
By the way, your stationery-store guy called.
He's got your pencil.
You are kidding me.
No.
He left the store early, made a special trip to the distributor and got it.
I bought one yesterday on 14th Street.
What did you do that for?
He already ordered it.
- I wanted to please Mr. Pitt.
- You better go down and tell this guy.
- He's very excited.
- Oh, boy.
- Oh, hi, Julie.
- Hi.
- Hi, Julie.
- How are you, Elaine?
- I'm meeting George here.
- Well, then I better get going.
Otherwise George will make me buy him lunch to make up for that big salad he bought me yesterday.
How do you know that?
- Who is it?
- It's Jerry.
It's kind of a bad time.
Could you come back later?
Come on, Newman, open the door!
Hello, Jerry.
What a rare treat.
What brings you down to the east wing?
Okay, pudgy, let's stop playing games.
What happened with Margaret?
Don't get excited.
Can't we discuss this like gentlemen?
No, we can't.
My skin is crawling just being inside your little rat's nest.
- Now, what happened?
- You wanna know what happened?
I'll tell you what happened.
She wasn't my type.
- Not your type?
- Not really.
- Well, how come?
- She just didn't do it for me.
- What is wrong with her?
- Well, if you're happy with her that's all that matters.
- You don't think she's attractive?
- No.
I need a really pretty face.
But, hey, that's me.
Okay, Newman.
Thanks a lot.
- Care for some lemonade?
- No, thank you.
Drop by anytime, Jerry.
Jerry.
All right, now, listen to this.
"If a player cleans his ball during play of a hole except on the putting green, he shall incur a penalty of one stroke.
" - That's the rule.
- It's just a friendly game.
- Why are you always such a stickler?
- That's the way I was raised.
When I was growing up, I had to be in bed every night by 9:00.
And if I wasn't Well, I don't have to tell you what happened.
What are you so worried about this for?
You know he talked about Pinkus on the course?
- He did?
- Oh, yeah.
He said he brought his pants to Pinkus', and they came back stained with some kind of dry-cleaning fluid.
And Pinkus denied responsibility.
You see?
He was very upset at Pinkus.
So it had nothing to do with you.
Yeah, but maybe I pushed him over the edge.
- No, I don't think so.
- Poor Pinkus.
Poor little Pinkus.
Hey, let me ask you a question.
You met Margaret.
You think Margaret's good-looking?
She's a natural beauty.
No makeup?
I like that.
Yeah.
And the curls?
You like the curls?
- Oh, I love curls.
- Yeah.
Yeah, me too.
- I'll see you later.
- Where you going?
- Gendason's.
- You're going to see Gendason?
It's weighing on my conscience.
I think I could have played with dolls if there were dolls in the house.
It seems like fun to me.
It doesn't seem like a gender thing.
I think I would like to play with dolls.
What's so terrible?
So, George, I was talking to Elaine before We're just friends.
Yes, well, anyway, she said something that was kind of intriguing.
Share.
Well, when I came over to the table, she mentioned something about how she'd better hurry up and leave or you'd make her buy lunch to make up for the one you bought yesterday.
I'm not following.
Well, my question is, how could Elaine be under the impression that you bought the big salad when I was the one that handed it to her?
Well, she probably just assumed.
Did she?
Wait a second.
Are you suggesting that I went out of my way to tell Elaine that even though you handed her the big salad, that it came from me?
That's what I'm suggesting.
Well, it was a big salad.
And what I would like to know is how does a person who has virtually nothing to do with the big salad claim responsibility for that salad and accept a thank-you under false pretenses?
George, all I did was hand someone a bag.
It's just that my boss is very demanding and he needed the pencil right away.
Well, why did you tell me to order it if you knew you were going to get one someplace else?
No, I didn't know.
I'm sorry.
I went all the way down to the warehouse.
It took me three hours.
I had a big fight with the foreman.
Really?
A fight with the foreman?
- Yes.
- Well, again, I'm just awfully sorry.
Yeah?
Well, then how about going out with me?
Okay.
I mean, they found a tee.
And he played golf that day.
Nobody walks into a dry cleaners' with a tee.
The circumstantial evidence is overwhelming.
You had how many dates with him?
Three?
Around three.
I don't know.
And..
?
I told you, he stopped calling me.
I moved on.
I'm not hung up on him.
- What are you looking at?
- What?
I'm not looking.
Nothing.
Why are you looking at my face?
Where am I gonna look?
Kiss me.
I can't.
Newman.
Newman ruined it.
All I could think of when I was looking at her face was, "Newman found this unacceptable.
" I'm going out with the stationery-store guy.
You're going out with the stationery-store guy?
I felt so guilty about the pencil I couldn't say no.
Well, well, well.
I'm not treating you to lunch anymore!
You had to tell Julie that I made a special point of telling you that I bought you the big salad, didn't you?
You know, if it was a regular salad, I wouldn't have said anything.
But you had to have the big salad!
Hello?
What?
You're kidding.
I'm turning it on.
Oh, my God, get out of here.
Hey, listen to this.
They issued a warrant for Gendason's arrest.
He escaped, and the police spotted him on the New Jersey Turnpike.
As you can see, he's in a white Ford Bronco.
The police have cleared the highway traffic in front but they are keeping their distance.
They don't want this situation to escalate.
And we have gotten an identification on the driver of the vehicle.
His name is Kramer and he's reportedly one of Gendason's golfing buddies.
911, what are you reporting?
Yeah, this is Kramer.
I got Gendason in the car.
Now, he wants to see his fish.
I'm taking him to see his fish, so tell the police to back off.
Okay, sir.
And what's your name?
My name is Kramer.
You know who I am, damn it!
- I told you not to take the turnpike.
- I thought we would blend in.
If you took the Palisades, this wouldn't happen.
- Then we would've had bridge traffic.
- Just drive.
To me, murder doesn't even really seem like that great of a revenge.
Wouldn't years of subtle psychological mind games be a lot more satisfying?
Constantly calling them and hanging up when they pick up the phone.
Sending pizzas and taxis to their house all night long.
After a while they go, "I wish this guy would kill me.
I can't take it anymore"!
How come when the police catch some really bad criminal they put him in the handcuffs, hit him with the baton put the chokehold on him, but then they don't want him to hurt his head when they're putting him in the patrol car.
"Watch your head.
Don't hit that metal edge there.
That really hurts.
"
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
There's something insincere about greeting cards.
They're like these little $1 folded-paper emotional prostitutes, isn't it?
"I don't know what my feelings are, so I'll pay some total stranger a buck to make up this little Hallmark hooker to do the job for me.
So I can go, 'Here, I didn't write this but whatever they wrote, I think the same thing.
"' Wouldn't it be better to have one card that covered every occasion for everybody in one shot?
"Happy birthday, merry Christmas, happy anniversary, congratulations it's a boy and our deepest sympathies.
" Signed, "The whole office.
" She was hitting on you?
My friend Noreen?
Your friend Noreen.
- Sure you're not flattering yourself?
- If I was flattering myself I think I'd come up with someone a little less annoying than Noreen.
I cannot believe that she was hitting on you.
- If you don't believe me, ask her.
- I will.
Besides, she's got a boyfriend.
You know him, Dan.
Remember, we went to that party at his house?
- The guy with the really high voice.
- Yeah.
Jerry, did you get my Fortune magazine in your mail?
Check the pile.
Yeah, yeah.
- Who sent you a card?
- I don't know.
Open it.
It's from Hallmark.
- Hello, my love.
- Hello, darling.
Isn't that cute.
A thank-you card from Kristin.
Let me see.
- Who's Kristin?
- Works for PBS.
Met her when I agreed to do the pledge drive.
Did you ask her about me?
Yeah.
In fact, she said that you could sit in the back and answer the phone.
Giddyup!
All right.
So now, how does that work?
What, I get a percentage of every pledge I bring in, right?
No.
It's not aluminum siding.
It's volunteer work.
All the money goes to the station.
Okay, yeah.
That sounds good.
But I still get a tote bag, right?
Yeah, and one of those foam beer-can holders.
You know what I'm doing?
- I'm calling Noreen.
- Go ahead.
- You sure you don't mind?
- Like she'll admit she was flirting.
- Hello?
- Hi.
It's Elaine.
- Listen, I was just talking to Jerry.
- Jerry?
- Jerry Seinfeld.
- Oh, I like Jerry a lot.
- You mean "like" like?
- What are you talking about?
Noreen, were you hitting on him?
Noreen's not here.
This is Dan.
Did you say that Noreen was hitting on Jerry Seinfeld?
I'll call you back later.
So was I right?
She likes me, right?
Hello.
It's for you.
Must you keep giving my number out?
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Pitt.
- Hello.
- Elaine, what is going on?
Why did you tell Dan I was hitting on Jerry Seinfeld?
- Is this Noreen?
- What would ever possess you to make up a story like that?
Well, listen, Jerry mentioned it, and I didn't believe I think I deserve an explanation.
Noreen, are you crying?
No, this is Dan.
- Hi, Dan.
- Elaine?
Work?
Tell Noreen I'll just call her back later.
Who was crying?
No one.
I'm sorry, Mr. Pitt.
That won't happen again.
I'm sure it won't.
But someone was crying and I want to know who it was.
Well, it's a long story, okay?
But my stupid friend Jerry told my other friend Noreen that she was you know, hitting on him.
And so I called her to see what was going on and I accidentally got her boyfriend, who is this you know I'm Jerry Seinfeld.
I tell jokes for a living but there's no joking about the financial crisis at PBS.
Show us you care.
Call in your pledge now.
Jerry, I am so grateful that you're doing this.
Oh, I know you are.
- You got the card I sent?
- I did.
- So where is it?
- What?
The card.
Is this it in the trash?
No.
This is my card.
You threw it away.
- Well - I put a lot of thought into this card.
You signed your name and you addressed the envelope.
It's not like you painted the picture and wrote the poem.
Oh, fine.
I gotta get back to the office.
Why, because I threw the card out?
How long was I supposed to save it?
You have no sentimentality.
I have sentimentality.
Really.
I'm sentimental.
Here, look.
Here's some cards I've saved.
These are birthday cards from my grandmother.
- I'm not a bad guy.
- So you save her cards but not mine.
Oh, great!
Well, but you see, I saved something.
See?
I can save.
I'll see you at the pledge drive, okay?
Well, new cards, huh?
No.
They're old cards from my grandmother.
Well, I'll tell you, a nice greeting card can really lift a person's spirits.
Yeah.
- A check.
- Yeah, she puts $10 in every birthday card.
That's why I save them.
There's a check in all these?
Why don't you cash them?
I don't know.
It's $10.
Yeah, but you got a whole pile here.
Look at this, 1987.
- So what?
- Your grandmother gave you this gift.
She wants you to spend the money, to have the fun that she can't have.
This is tantamount to a slap in the face.
- Oh, get out of here.
- Jerry a gift not enjoyed is like a flower that doesn't blossom.
All right.
All right.
I'll cash the checks.
Yeah.
It was a thank-you card from Kristin because I'm doing the PBS drive.
I mean, how long am I supposed to keep it?
The rule's a minimum of two days.
You making that up, or you know?
I'm making it up.
I mean, really, what is the point of saving it?
I could see if I had a mantel.
Well, a mantel's a whole different story.
- Absolutely.
- If my parents had a mantel I might be a completely different person.
So anyway, she's kind of upset about it so I need you to do me a favor.
- Let's have it.
- Well, I'm doing the PBS drive.
So during the show, they're running the Ken Burns Baseball thing.
So I thought if I could get a baseball player to come on the show with me - You want me to ask a Yankee.
- Could you?
All right.
- I'll run it by a few people.
- All right.
Do your thing where you lie to everyone.
I should never have made that phone call.
- Did you ever get to talk to Noreen?
- Yes.
She's very upset.
So was I right about the flirting?
Was it true?
I don't know.
I never asked.
She was yelling Who was flirting with you?
Remember when we were in the bookstore?
That woman came up to us.
- She wasn't flirting with you.
- Oh, sure she was.
Asked me where the humor section was.
Humor?
Come on.
Jerry her brother just had a book of political cartoons published.
All right.
So maybe she wasn't flirting with me.
So what?
Oh, yeah, that's funny.
Hey, you wanna hear something weird?
Mr. Pitt eats his Snickers bars with a knife and fork.
- Really?
- Yes.
Why does he do that?
He probably doesn't wanna get chocolate on his fingers.
That's the way these society types eat their candy bars.
Oh, you know.
What, you think I eat all my meals with you?
Excuse me.
Sweetheart?
I think you may have overcharged us.
- What is this?
- That's the extra toast.
Get it?
Got it.
Did you just see what happened here?
What?
Did you see the way she pointed at the check?
She gave me the finger.
That's how waitress types express derision.
They don't wanna get their mouths dirty.
So, what do you think?
PBS fundraiser?
I'm not gonna waste the players' time.
Besides, the team already does so much promotion for Channel 11.
Channel 11.
Forgive me for trying to class up this place.
For trying to have the Yankees reach another strata of society that might not watch Channel 11.
What the hell are you doing?
I am eating my dessert.
How do you eat it, with your hands?
You know, maybe George has something here about PBS.
Okay, 60 bucks from Nana.
Yeah.
- Hello?
- Hello.
This is Chemical Bank.
Just wanted you to know that your checking account is overdrawn.
Chemical Bank?
I haven't used that account in months.
Well, someone's been cashing the checks, and you're overdrawn.
Oh, dear.
I'll be down there first thing in the morning.
Wait, we can do this over the phone.
You got Danny Tartabull?
You wanted a Yankee, I got you a Yankee.
You really came through.
Kristin's gonna be thrilled.
The Bull owes me one.
I helped him with his swing.
So you're bringing Danny Tartabull to the fundraiser tonight.
Absolutely.
Pending approval of the script.
- Excuse me?
- Jerry, I'm Yankee management.
- Yeah, I'd like to see the script too.
- You're just answering phones!
It would put me at ease.
Hey.
When you order, get the waitress to point to the menu.
I wanna see what finger she uses.
Say, I wanted a side order of fruit, but I didn't see it on the menu.
You'll get it.
Comes with your breakfast special.
Right you are.
You know, I didn't get the special, but I'd also like the fresh fruit too.
I'll check.
I don't believe it.
She did it again!
Oh, she had an itch.
Had an itch.
She could have used any finger.
That finger was meant for me.
Yeah.
She knew what she was doing.
By the way, lunch is on me.
I just cashed my nana's birthday checks.
Looking for something, lady?
Isn't the Chemical Bank on this block?
The bank.
It burned.
It's gone.
Oh, dear.
You know, what you wanna do is go down to 49th Street.
That's the main customer-service branch.
Ask for Mr. Fleming.
He'll help you.
- Hello.
- Jerry, hello.
- Uncle Leo.
- Listen, I don't wanna alarm you but your nana is missing!
Nana's missing?
I came to pick her up for her doctor's appointment.
She wasn't here.
I called the doctor.
Nobody knows where she is.
She hasn't left the apartment in 25 years.
I've been thinking about her.
I just cashed some of her checks.
- That's right.
- What kind of checks?
- I think Chemical.
- They were Chemical.
Chemical?
She hasn't used that account since her branch closed.
What are you doing cashing her checks anyway?
Kramer thought it would make her happy.
I never should have cashed those checks!
Hey, I didn't twist your arm.
Your grandmother's on a very fixed income.
What are you, broke?
All right, just call me if you hear anything.
Well, I cash the checks, the checks bounce and now my nana's missing!
- Well, don't look at me.
- It's your fault!
My fault?
Your nana is missing because she's been passing those bum checks all over town and she finally pissed off the wrong people.
So anyway, it's caused a lot of problems.
Dan thinks I'm interested in Jerry.
He won't let up.
Well, I'm really sorry.
But you can see why I'd make a mistake like that.
No.
Why?
Well, you know, because he's a high talker.
Well, he does raise his voice occasionally, but that's normal.
No.
No, no.
Not a loud talker a high talker.
Really?
You don't think his voice sounds a lot like yours?
I never noticed that.
Well, it's no big deal.
You know, it's just that he can sound like a woman, you know?
Great.
I'm going out with a man who sounds like a woman.
Well, he looks like a man.
Yeah.
He's bald.
I know that's a guy thing.
I guess.
I know he belches a lot.
Well, that's something.
So Jerry thought I was flirting with him.
Yeah.
He's kind of a baritone, isn't he?
- What are you doing?
- I'm eating this cookie.
No, no.
But why are you using a knife and fork?
Did you just think of that?
No.
I've seen people do it.
I like it.
- So this isn't gonna take long, is it?
- Oh, no, no.
In and out.
I made sure of that.
And you'll be happy to know I perused the script and it's met with my approval.
- Yeah.
I'm sure it's fine.
Hey!
Hey, watch it!
Did you see that guy?
He just gave me the finger.
- You sure?
- Oh, yeah!
Middle finger, straight up, at me.
At us.
- What are you doing?
- I'm following him.
I'm sorry.
The account had insufficient funds.
We had to return the checks made out to a Mr. Jerry Seinfeld.
Oh, dear.
That's my grandson.
- May I call him now and explain?
- Oh, certainly, certainly.
And now I think she might really be interested in you.
And Dan is obsessed.
He keeps leaving these annoying messages on my machine.
Would you?
- Hello?
- Hello.
I need to speak to Jerry.
Oh, it's you.
We were just talking about you.
Listen, Jerry doesn't wanna talk to you.
Nobody wants to talk to you, so why don't you just drop dead.
Hey.
All right.
- Any word from Nana?
- No.
- Nana?
- Yeah.
My grandma's missing.
- Missing?
- Yeah.
Think it might have something to do with those checks.
What does Nana sound like?
Like a grandmother.
Why?
Well, I Oh, you hung up on my nana?
I don't know.
Maybe.
You told Nana to drop dead.
- It's possible.
- Yes, it is.
All right.
Look, Jerry, we gotta get down to PBS PDQ.
All right.
No one gives us the finger.
We're Yankees.
- Want this last doughnut?
- Oh, you can have it.
- Jerry, where are the tote bags?
- I don't know.
Well, I'm not leaving without tote bags.
I was promised tote bags, and tote bags I shall have.
- Jerry, this man wants to see you.
- Leo.
- Hello.
- Uncle Leo.
- What are you doing here?
- I wanted to tell you your grandmother is fine.
She's had quite a day, but she's gonna watch you tonight on the TV.
- Yeah.
- Jerry.
I'm dying to meet Danny Tartabull.
Where is he?
He'll be here any second.
- You guys are both on in five minutes.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay.
- Bye-bye.
Why didn't you tell me you were a little short?
Here.
If anybody asks you where you got it, you don't know.
- No, that's okay, I really don't need - What are you talking about?
- It's not necessary.
- Would you please take the..
?
- I can't take it.
- I want you to have it.
- Jerry, take the money!
- I don't want it!
Jerry, open up.
We need to talk.
Who's that?
Sounds like that friend of Elaine's that was hitting on me in the bookstore.
Jerry, I'll take care of it.
Is Jerry in there?
Well, he can't be disturbed now.
Well, this situation's driving me crazy.
He's all I think about.
I can't get him out of my mind.
Well, I'm sorry, fella.
I mean, I know what it's like to be in love.
It just ties you up in knots.
And Jerry is a very sexy man.
- What?
- Look, I'm not judging you.
In fact, we here at PBS, we have many programs celebrating your lifestyle.
Armistead Maupin's Tales of the City gender-bending and swinging in San Francisco.
Before Stonewall, about those dark ages when you couldn't come out of the closet lest you be persecuted because of your, you know No, I don't.
Are you Danny Tartabull?
No, I'm not.
I'll take care of this, Danny.
- Excuse me.
- What's the problem?
I believe you cut me off and then made an obscene gesture.
I did?
Where?
Outside of Manhattan about an hour ago.
Is that Danny Tartabull?
That's right.
Of the New York Yankees.
I'd like to shake his hand, but I can't.
I'm Jerry Seinfeld.
I tell jokes for a living.
But there's no joking about the financial crisis here at PBS.
Our lines are open, so please call the number you see on your screen.
This is the only time this year we'll be asking for donations.
- PBS pledge drive.
- Hello.
I'd like to speak with Jerry.
You again, buddy.
Look, forget about Jerry.
- It's not gonna happen.
- This is his grandmother.
Oh, Nana.
- Hello.
- Tell Jerry I'm sorry.
I'm going to have to write him some new checks.
As long as you got your checkbook out how about forking a little over to PBS?
You watch this station, don't you?
Don't be a freeloader.
Programs like Ken Burns' Baseball.
And if Danny Tartabull were here I'm sure he'd say, "That's correct, Jerry.
" Jerry.
I have an announcement.
- Your grandmother is on the line.
- My nana?
And as we speak, she's generously writing PBS a check for $1500!
She can't do that.
She's on a very fixed income.
Stop the show!
I got another card from Kristin.
Not quite as chipper as the first one.
- Isn't this little bunny giving you the..
?
- Yes, he is.
- You should show this to Georgie.
- Yeah.
- Here's your knife and fork.
- Thank you.
Look, she's cutting up an Almond Joy.
I just don't get it.
I saw someone on the street eating M&M's with a spoon.
What is wrong with everybody?
Look, they're doing it.
They're all doing it.
What is wrong with all you people?
Have you all gone mad?
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
The thing I admire about the Chinese is they're hanging in there with the chopsticks.
Because if you think about it, they've seen the fork by now.
I'm sure they've seen the spoon.
They're going, "Yeah, they're okay.
We're gonna stay with the sticks.
" I mean, I don't know how they missed it.
Thousands of years ago, Chinese farmer gets up has his breakfast with the chopsticks goes out and works all day in the field with a shovel.
Hello?
Shovel?
Not going out there plowing 40 acres with a couple of pool cues.
Good shave today.
Don't worry, I can manage these bags.
Really, I'm fine.
I'm thinking of letting my sideburns grow in.
Can we rest here a second?
Yeah, I guess.
- So how's Noreen?
- She got a new boyfriend.
Paul.
Already?
That was fast.
I assume he's not a high-talker.
No, but he has the worst habit.
Whenever he answers the phone, he won't put Noreen right on.
You have to go through 10 minutes of chit-chat.
- A long-talker.
- Yeah.
He is so boring.
Now whenever he answers the phone, I just hang up.
All right, let's move it out.
Hey, isn't that George's father?
Oh, yeah, it is.
Should we say hello?
I've never seen him in Manhattan before.
It's weird.
It's so out of context.
That man he's with is he wearing a cape?
I believe he is wearing a cape.
Why is Mr. Costanza with a man in a cape?
Well, it is good cape weather.
Cool, breezy.
Why a cape?
Who wears a cape?
Where do you even get a cape?
You're right, it is strange.
In fact, let's cross to the other side of the street.
Cover me.
Just plop it on the counter there.
Oh, I got a message.
Hey, it's George.
I got nothing to say.
That sounds urgent.
Let me call him back.
Hello?
Who is this?
Donna Chang?
I'm sorry.
I must have dialed the wrong number.
Donna Chang?
Should've talked.
I love Chinese women.
Isn't that a little racist?
If I like their race, how can that be racist?
Hello?
Oh, is this Donna Chang again?
Yes, I am calling George.
Oh, the lines are crossed.
You're getting his calls.
Well, what do you know.
- Hi.
- So listen I'm going through this stuff like water.
- Who are you talking to?
- He's on with a Chinese woman.
You know, I dig Asian women.
You got a comfort problem there?
No, I think these Jockeys shrunk.
- I thought you wore silk underwear.
- No.
I wore them for a month, but I couldn't stick with it.
I need the secure packaging of Jockeys.
My boys need a house.
That's nice.
Listen, if you ever wanna have kids, you shouldn't wear briefs.
Boxers are much better for your sperm count.
Sperm count?
Well, how many sperm should I have?
A lot.
I got a date.
- With the Chinese woman?
- She knew who I was.
She saw me at a club one time.
My first date ever with the Pacific Rim.
I'm very excited.
Jerry, you ever have your sperm count checked?
No, why should I?
I wear boxers.
You ever get a woman pregnant?
I'm sorry, Kramer.
Those records are permanently sealed.
What would you say if I told you I never impregnated a woman?
Really?
You never slipped one past the goalie in all these years?
I'm surprised.
You've slept with a lot of women.
A lot of women!
Do you think maybe I'm depleted?
Well, I'm sure you're not totally depleted.
But what if I am?
I'm the last male Kramer.
We're facing extinction.
Go to a fertility clinic, check your sperm count.
Yeah, but then I'd have to Well, you know Into a cup in the middle of the day?
What, does that conflict with your regular schedule?
All right, I'm gonna try Noreen again.
I am very excited about this date.
We're going to Hunan Balcony.
She's Chinese, so you suggest Chinese food?
- She suggested it.
- I thought Chinese don't eat Chinese.
She's very assimilated.
Hello.
- Paul again?
- You can't get one ring past him.
- Hey, hey.
You don't call me back?
- I tried.
Your line's crossed with a Chinese woman.
Hey, George, we saw your father on the street before.
What's he doing in the city today?
You didn't ask him?
- You didn't say hello?
- Well, he was with someone a man in a cape.
Why was he wearing a cape?
Was my father wearing a cape?
No, jacket and tie.
No cape.
A cape.
What was a man with a cape doing with my father?
What was my father doing with a man in a cape?
Why a cape?
The results of your sperm test are in.
Are you planning to start a family?
Yes, I would like to very much.
I'm low, aren't I?
I can feel it.
- Yes, I'm afraid you're a little low.
- Oh, man!
It's over.
The Kramer name is finished.
- I'm never gonna procreate, huh?
- That's not necessarily true.
There are measures you can take to improve your fertility.
All right, what?
What?
You tell me.
I'll do anything.
Come on, tell me.
First thing, you should wear boxer shorts.
- All the time?
- All the time.
You have to get off Jockeys right away.
But I've always worn Jockeys.
Hi, Paul, it's Elaine calling.
Yeah, I'm calling from a car phone, so I don't really have time to talk.
Is Noreen there?
Oh, she's not?
Okay, great.
Well, you can just tell her I called then, and Well, yes, it has been unseasonably cool lately.
Okay.
Well, look, I'm pulling up to the building now, so I'm gonna Yeah, I tip 20 percent too.
Lookit, Paul, the car seems to be running out of gas so I'm gonna have to get off the phone.
Please let me know when your party has arrived.
Yes, I will.
- You mind?
- No, go ahead.
I secondhand smoke two packs a day.
Jerry.
- Excuse me?
- Hi, sorry I'm late.
- Who are you?
- I'm Donna Chang.
What do you mean?
I mean I'm Donna Chang.
You're Donna Chang?
Did you think I was Chinese?
No.
What, you mean because of the "Chang"?
Actually, the family name wasn't originally Chang.
- I didn't think so.
- Used to be "Changstein.
" - She's not Chinese?
- No, not Chinese.
Not even Asian.
- So, what is she?
- Well, she's like you.
Oh, how disappointed you must have been.
Well, it's false advertising, see?
And the thing is, I think she likes people thinking she's Chinese.
She suggests Chinese food she always introduces herself as Donna Chang.
So why are you seeing her again?
Well, she is a woman.
Listen, I spoke to Paul and Noreen.
They might be breaking up.
- Really?
- Well, maybe.
Hey, wouldn't it be funny if Paul and Noreen broke up because you kept hanging up on him?
- What do you mean?
- If Paul thought it was some guy hanging up because he was having an affair with Noreen.
Here, take my Jockey shorts.
Hey, what is that?
Look, you gotta help me.
I have to get off Jockey shorts.
- What, you have low sperm count?
- Very low.
- Come on, take them.
- I don't want them.
Jerry, look, you gotta help.
If I have one pair in my house, I'll wear them.
- I don't want them.
- All it takes is one pair.
I'm not gonna be able to sleep if those are in the house.
Boxers!
How do you wear these things?
Look at that.
They're bagging up.
They're rising here.
And there's nothing holding me in place.
I'm flipping, I'm flopping.
What am I gonna do?
Jerry, I'm going crazy in these things.
Well, I'm gonna have to move now.
You know what I like about Manhattan?
There's no mosquitoes.
There's plenty of mosquitoes.
Queens is full of mosquitoes.
- So, Dad - Gnats, too, if I'm not mistaken.
Heard you were in the city the other day.
Your mother has to tell you every move I make?
I'll kill her.
- Jerry and Elaine saw you.
- They didn't say hello?
- They were in a rush.
- They couldn't just say hello?
Ah, the hell with them.
They said you were with some guy who was wearing a cape.
Elaine, I can see not saying hello.
She's very What's the word?
Supercilious.
- So, Dad - How could Jerry not say hello?
- Did they uncross the lines yet?
- They can't find the problem.
It's really getting ridicurous.
Did you say "ridicurous"?
Ridiculous.
I thought you said ridicurous.
Hey, what are you doing here?
I wanted to talk to you.
I didn't know you had company.
- Oh, no, no.
- Hi, I'm George.
- Oh, hi.
- I'm Donna Chang.
I just spoke to your mother before.
- You spoke to my mother?
- She was trying to call you, but The rines are crossed.
Did you say the "rines" are crossed?
Did I?
George, she's so sweet.
We talked for an hour.
Anyway, I'm really sorry.
Sorry, why sorry?
What do you have to be sorry about?
Well, she told me she and your father are getting divorced.
Boy, divorced.
That's really too bad.
Yeah.
You know, it's a shame his parents didn't get divorced 30 years ago.
He could've been normal.
Oh, my God!
You know what I just realized?
If they get divorced and live in two separate places that's twice as many visits.
I never thought of that.
Imagine if I had to see them both on the same day.
It's like running a double marathon.
Hey, Georgie, did you have any idea that anything was wrong?
Have you ever spent any time with these people?
- You know what this has to do with?
- What?
The man in the cape.
I bet you he is mixed up in this.
I don't trust men in capes.
You can't cast dispersions on someone just because they're wearing a cape.
Superman wore a cape.
And I'll be damned if I'm gonna stand here and let you say something bad about him.
All right, Superman's the exception.
Hey, Elaine, I just heard that Noreen and Paul are breaking up.
I want you to put in a good word for me.
Always had a thing for Noreen.
No, Kramer, you don't understand, this could be my fault.
Well, if she's available, I won't let her slip through my fingers this time.
Well, looks like you've adjusted to the boxers.
Well, I wouldn't go as far as that.
- You went back to the Jockeys?
- Wrong again.
Oh, no.
What?
What?
Don't you see what's going on here?
No boxers, no Jockeys.
The only thing between him and us is a thin layer of gabardine.
- Kramer, say it isn't so.
- Oh, it be so.
I'm out there, Jerry, and I'm loving every minute of it!
Don't you need a little help?
Surprisingly, no.
I'm free.
I'm unfettered.
I feel like a naked, innocent boy roaming the countryside.
So you guys are trying to work it out.
That's great.
Yeah, well, we're trying, but he just went insane there for a while.
He went insane?
Believe it or not Paul was convinced I was having an affair because somebody kept calling and hanging up whenever he answered.
What kind of a sick person calls and hangs up over and over?
Well I don't know about sick.
I mean, maybe it was somebody who didn't wanna talk to whoever was answering because whoever was answering was always making boring chit-chat and was completely oblivious to the fact that the person who was calling didn't wanna speak to them.
I can't believe that was you.
I'm really sorry, Noreen.
So you thought he was boring?
Hey, Noreen, don't go by me.
What are you doing to this woman?
This is the second relationship you've ruined for her in a few weeks.
- I know.
- First you ruin her relationship with the high-talker.
- Well, I got confused.
They sound exactly the same.
So she breaks up with him.
Somehow picks up the pieces of her life miraculously meets a new guy.
You bust that up.
And then just as they're reconciling, you announce to the world he's boring.
I didn't know she'd take it so seriously.
Apparently, you have a tremendous influence over this woman.
Anything you say, she does.
- Yeah?
- It's Donna Chang.
- Come on up.
- I guess I just didn't realize it.
Well, let's look back at your history with this woman.
- Okay?
- Okay.
First, you encouraged her to join the army.
She did.
She was lost.
Then you suggest she goes AWOL.
She did.
Well, she didn't seem to be having so much fun.
Make sure you never tell this woman to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge.
If I have this much influence, I'll call her and tell her to get back together with him.
- Hey.
- Oh, Miss Changstein.
- This is Elaine.
- Hi.
How are you?
Guess what?
Mrs. Costanza called me.
- They're not getting divorced.
- Why, what happened?
She was trying to call George last night, she got me we spoke for an hour, and she changed her mind.
- Wow, that's amazing.
- Anyway, she wants to meet me.
She invited me over for dinner.
Said you should come too.
- Tonight?
- Yeah.
I just remembered.
I'm gonna have to cancel my acupuncture class.
All right, let me just say one thing.
There is no way that this is gonna happen.
No way!
Because if you think I'm going to two Thanksgivings you're out of your mind!
- We're not getting divorced.
- Your mother changed her mind.
You did?
That's good.
That's very good.
- I'm very glad to hear that.
- Yeah, we worked it out.
All right, so let me ask you a question.
Who was the man in the cape?
- He was my lawyer.
- Your lawyer wears a cape?
Yeah.
So what?
- Who wears a cape?
- He's very independent.
He doesn't follow the trends.
He looks ridiculous in that thing.
You have no eye for fashion!
- I have no eye for fashion?
- All right.
Come on.
Let's not fight.
- All right, all right.
- All right.
Georgie's right.
So, what made you change your mind?
It was that Chinese woman.
What did you tell Mrs. Costanza that changed her mind?
Mentioned a few bits of wisdom from Confucius.
- Confucius, huh?
- Yeah.
You know, you're not Chinese.
Hey, I heard the good news.
Jerry, how come you didn't say hello to me the other day?
- Elaine was in a rush.
- I knew it was Elaine.
- You must be Estelle.
- Yes.
Who are you?
I'm Donna Chang.
You're not Chinese.
Hello?
- Paul?
- Elaine.
Kramer?
Yeah!
- What are you doing there?
- Well, isn't it obvious?
- Is Noreen there?
- Yes, she is.
Well, can I talk to her?
What, am I too boring for you?
Would you just put her on?
I feel it would be best that you didn't talk to Noreen for a while.
- You feel?
- That's right.
She and I have had a very long talk.
And I was appalled to learn of the destructive influence you've had over her life lo these many years.
- What, are you insane?
- From now on, I'll be calling the shots.
And what are you gonna tell her?
Well, I've encouraged her to go back into the army.
There she'll get the structure and discipline she needs right now.
And she'll have qualified officers telling her what to do.
Kramer, you have got to let me talk to her.
Can't help you, kid.
- You're not Chinese?
- No.
- I thought you were Chinese.
- I'm from Long Island.
Long Island?
I thought I was getting advice from a Chinese woman.
- I'm sorry.
- Well, then that changes everything.
- What?
She's not Chinese.
I was duped!
So what?
She still gave you advice.
What's the difference?
I'm not taking advice from some girl from Long Island.
Now you're getting a divorce because she's from Long Island?
You want a divorce?
You got one!
You know, you might wanna think about changing your name.
Ever since she started dating Kramer, she won't even talk to me.
Well, Noreen listened to you like George's mother listened to the Chinese.
Everybody listens to the Chinese.
Look at the fortune cookie.
You couldn't get away with that at other restaurants.
Yeah, no one's reading any rolled up messages in a knish.
Well, it had to happen.
I knew it.
I predicted it.
Saw both of them today.
What a disaster.
I'm running all over Queens.
First, I saw my mother.
We had lunch together.
I never had lunch with my mother before.
It's like a date.
Then we drive down to Kew Gardens, tons of traffic, I see my father.
We played Clue.
All day with this!
Hey, Jerry!
Guess what?
The Kramer name might live on!
Noreen's late!
She's late!
- Who are you?
- I'm Frank Costanza's lawyer.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Love seat is interesting.
Some guy thought: "If they won't sit closer to us why not just shorten the furniture"?
My favorite furniture brand is the La-Z-Boy.
This is very flattering to the prospective customer, isn't it?
Why not call it the half-conscious- deadbeat-with-no-job-home-all-day eating-Cheetos and-watching-TV recliner?
And it goes back so far, that thing.
I mean, go to bed already.
It's over.
You're wiped.
So she got you to join a book club?
I got a feeling I'm gonna be much smarter than you pretty soon.
Well, I think that statement alone reflects your burgeoning intelligence.
- What about this one?
- No, I don't like that one.
- So, what's your first book?
- Breakfast at Tiffany's.
Ninety pages.
- It's kind of old, isn't it?
- They wanted a Truman Capote book.
Oh, sure, Truman Capote.
- He's a great writer.
- Oh, yeah.
- Ever read anything by him?
- No.
You?
No.
What about this one?
Look at this.
This is it.
This is what I'm looking for.
Oh, yeah.
- Hey, what's going on?
- New couch, baby.
New couch?
Why?
I love this couch.
The best part is it doesn't fold out so no one can sleep over.
Hello.
Hello.
Oh, let me get the door for you.
Be careful.
Wait till you see it.
It's perfect.
The guy told me it's one of a kind.
They stopped making it.
What are you doing with your old couch?
The moving guys are taking it.
You want it?
Yeah, I'll take it.
I'm sure they can deliver it to you.
Yes, they can.
- Hey, couch is coming.
- It's here.
All right.
Yeah.
You know, I'm excited about this, Jerry.
In a way, I feel like I'm getting a new couch.
Yeah, so do I. You remember Poppie?
- You mean from Poppie's restaurant?
- Yeah, yeah.
Anyway, we're going into business together.
Remember my idea about the place where you make your own pizza?
- What was that again?
It's a pizza place where you make your own pie.
We give you the dough, the sauce, the cheese.
You pound it, slap it, you flip it up into the air put your toppings on, and you slide it into the oven.
That sounds good, huh?
I can't wait to get me a fella and make my own pie.
What made you resurrect that old idea?
Well, I happened to be eating at Poppie's when I told him the old idea and his eyes: Just lit up.
- You know, he wants to back it.
- I heard Poppie's was good.
Let's go.
I'm not going.
Didn't he get busted by the board of health?
No, that was in the past, Jerry.
As it happens, New York magazine just judged his kitchen to be one of the cleanest in the city.
They got a duck there, you think you died and went to heaven.
I love duck.
Come on, come on.
You gotta order it two days in advance.
I'll call them, I'll order the duck for you.
Kramer, I Right there, guys.
That's perfect.
What do you think, Lainey?
Well, I don't know.
I'll have to sit on it.
Oh, no, I don't want anyone sitting on it.
Sign here.
Excuse me.
I was wondering if it would be possible if you could you deliver the old couch to my apartment?
- It's not very far.
- Sure.
Okay.
You got room in the truck for me?
I think we can squeeze you in.
Oh, goody.
Okay.
Well I'll see you chumps later.
Did you offer those guys a drink?
No.
Should I have?
- What kind of a person are you?
- I don't know.
Okay, Breakfast at Tiffany's.
So he puts the couch down and just as he's about to leave, he says, "Do you date moving men"?
- You wanna know what I said?
- I can't wait.
"I do now.
" - Clever.
- Is that something?
- Is that something?
- Yes, you're something.
So anyway, when they were in my house before I didn't offer them anything to drink.
Well, they're real men, Jerry.
They get sweaty.
So anyone sweaty in your house has to be offered a drink?
Yes.
Would you apologize for me?
Hello.
Jerry, so good to see you again.
Hello Poppie.
- This is Elaine.
- Nice to meet you, Poppie.
- Let me show you to your table.
- Okay.
Your duck is cooking as we speak.
It is so succulent, so succulent.
So Kramer told us all about your business venture together.
Your friend and I are gonna make a lot of money.
Of course, I already have a lot of money.
Poppie does very well.
Very well.
Well, your mother must be very proud of you.
My mother was taken from my house by the communists in the middle of the night when I was 10 years old.
She was sent to a slave-labor camp where she labored for 12 years.
Finally, they released her and she was on a boat to America to reunite with us.
But she was served some bad fish, and she died on the high seas.
So, what's good tonight?
Boy, I'm really looking forward to this duck.
I've never had food ordered in advance before.
Could have stayed home and ordered pizza from Pokeno's.
Pokeno's?
Oh, no.
You should never order pizza from Pokeno's.
- Why not?
- The owner contributes money to those fanatical anti-abortion groups.
- So you won't eat the pizza?
- No way.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Well, what if Poppie felt the same way?
Well, I guess I wouldn't eat here then.
Really?
Yeah, that's right.
Well, perhaps we should inquire.
Poppie?
Oh, Poppie?
- Could I have a word?
- Yes, Jerry.
I just checked your duck.
It is more succulent than even I had hoped.
Poppie, I was just curious.
Where do you stand on abortion?
When my mother was abducted by the communists she was with a child.
- Oh, boy.
But the communists, they put an end to that.
So on this issue, there is no debate and no intelligent person can think differently.
Well, Poppie, I think differently.
And what gives you the right to do that?
The Supreme Court gives me the right to do that!
Let's go, Jerry.
Come on.
I heard that.
Let's go, Henry.
- We just got here.
- I'm with you, Poppie.
- Let's go.
- And I am not coming back!
You're not welcome!
Well, I'm certainly glad I brought it up.
Well, you should've seen it.
It was quite a scene over there.
- I'm sorry I missed it.
- Oh, you really missed something.
And I have to say it was pretty much all my fault.
So how's the book coming?
- I say how's the book coming?
- Oh, pretty good.
So, what's it about?
- Well, it's about Holly Golightly.
- Holly Golightly.
- Yeah, she's quite a character.
- Haven't read a page, have you?
- No.
- Big surprise.
I couldn't.
If it's not about sports, I find it very hard to concentrate.
You're not very bright, are you?
No, I'm not.
I would like to be, but I'm not.
What am I gonna do?
The book club meets in a few days.
Why don't you rent the movie?
Why don't I rent the movie?
You see?
This is when I like you.
Now I'm relieved.
So how was the dinner last night?
Oh, well Did you enjoy the duck?
Oh, Elaine, I was just asking how dinner went last night.
- Oh, well - All right, what did you do to Poppie?
- Nothing.
- Well, he's in the hospital.
And the cook says you put him there.
- What's wrong with him?
- I don't know.
I'm gonna go and visit him later.
It would be nice if you got him something.
We should get him something.
Yeah, you're right.
Do you know I've been using the same bottle of shampoo for a year?
And I shampoo every day.
So, what do you think of my conversation?
Not much.
I would've invited you up but I don't have any furniture.
- You don't have any furniture?
- No, I hate furniture.
I can't look at it.
Oh, I can understand that.
- A pretty good date, huh?
- Yeah, no heavy lifting.
Anyway, Jerry and Elaine felt bad about what happened to you and wanted you to have this.
What's this?
A bottle of wine and a five-alarm chili?
They're trying to kill Poppie?
- Why?
- Don't they know I have a gastrointestinal disorder?
If I would have any of this, I would die.
Then Poppie's no good to anyone.
This is a sick, sick joke on Poppie.
How could you be friends with those two?
Well, we're not very close.
- They owe me for those ducks.
- Yeah.
- They're flown in from Newfoundland.
- They got good ducks there, huh?
Very good ducks.
I'm in love!
This is it, Jerry!
This is it!
He is such an incredible person.
He's real.
He's honest.
He's unpretentious.
Oh, I'm really lucky.
Did you tell him I was sorry about the drink?
No.
I forgot.
The best part is, he doesn't play games.
You know?
There are no games.
No games?
What is the point of dating without games?
How do you know if you're winning or losing?
Well, all I know is he doesn't like games, and he doesn't play games.
You know, he has too much character and integrity.
And what is his stand on abortion?
What?
What is his stand on abortion?
Well, I'm sure he's pro-choice.
How do you know?
Because he Well He's just so good-looking.
Well, you should probably ask.
Because if he's gonna be coming over with those Pokeno's pizzas could be trouble.
I'd like to rent Breakfast at Tiffany's.
This is out.
Someone has it.
Out?
Oh, no, I've I've been to four places.
You're the only ones with it.
Well, I could put it on reserve for you if you'd like.
Maybe we could call them and ask them to return it.
Sorry, we can't do that.
Well, maybe they're done with it.
I could go pick it up.
I don't think so.
It doesn't work that way.
Yes?
Excuse me, are you Joe Temple?
Yes.
Yes, you don't know me.
My name is George Costanza.
Did you happen to rent Breakfast at Tiffany's?
- Hey.
- What's happening?
Well, you know, Poppie's over at my place.
Tonight's the big night.
I'll make the first test pizza at the restaurant.
You got a regular Manhattan Project going on over there.
Anyway, he's about to leave.
He wants the duck money.
- Oh, okay.
Hi, Poppie.
- Hello.
Sorry about the gift.
I didn't know about your condition.
That's fine.
If you just give me my duck money, I'll be on my way.
Okay, I'll get it.
Why don't you sit down, Poppie, you're still recuperating.
Are you tired, Poppie?
- No.
- Poppie, you really think people wanna make their own pizza?
Kramer, did I ever tell you about my mother?
- My mother - Here you go.
Anyway, I'm sorry again about the - The - The what?
The - The The - Okay, Poppie.
So long, huh?
I'll see you tonight.
Kramer, what is this?
- What is what?
- This puddle on my sofa!
- What puddle?
- That puddle!
I don't know.
Is it..
?
Could it..
?
Could he have..
?
It is!
Poppie peed on my sofa!
- Are you sure?
- Well, what is it, then?
My new sofa!
Poppie peed on my new sofa!
I'm sure it'll come out.
I don't care if it comes out.
I can't sit on that anymore.
- You're making too much of it.
- Yeah, you're right.
Just a natural human function.
Happens to be on my sofa instead of in the toilet, where it would normally be.
Right.
Well, anyway, the book club meets tomorrow, Mr. Temple.
Well, I was gonna watch it with my daughter.
She likes Audrey Hepburn very much.
Yeah, she was a delicate flower.
Why didn't you just read the book?
Well, as I say, the pinkeye made my vision quite blurry.
Remy.
This is George.
Would you mind if he watched Breakfast at Tiffany's with us?
- Hi.
- Hi.
- I missed you.
- Oh, I missed you.
I don't remember the last time I felt this way.
Me either.
- I think about you all the time.
- You do?
- Do you think about me?
- Oh, yeah, all the time.
All the time.
Although recently I've been thinking about this friend of mine.
- What friend?
- Oh, just this woman.
She got impregnated by her troglodytic half-brother and decided to have an abortion.
You know, someday we're gonna get enough people on the Supreme Court to change that law.
So anything to nosh?
What did you want?
Popcorn?
Popcorn?
Where do you think you are?
A lot of people keep popcorn in the house.
Well, we don't.
You might wanna try it.
Makes the movie more enjoyable, that's all.
- Here's some nuts.
- Oh, nuts!
Excellent!
You know what I love?
How there's two nuts named after people: Hazel and Filbert.
Can we watch the movie now, Daddy?
Hey, let's turn off the lights, get some real movie atmosphere.
The lights are fine.
See?
Everybody can do this.
Yeah.
No, no.
Use your wrist.
It's all in the wrist.
- Oh, yeah.
- Not too high!
Very good.
That's very good.
All right, put a little sauce on here.
- Now some cheese.
- Not too much.
And cucumbers.
Hey, wait a second.
What is that?
- It's cucumbers.
- No, no.
You can't put cucumbers on a pizza.
Why not?
I like cucumbers.
That's not a pizza.
It will taste terrible.
But that's the idea.
Make your own pie.
Yes, but we cannot give the people the right to choose any topping they want.
Now, on this issue, there can be no debate.
What gives you the right to tell me how I make my pie?
Because it's a pizza.
It's not a pizza till it comes out of the oven.
It's a pizza the moment you put your fists in the dough.
- No, it isn't!
- Yes, it is!
- I'm home.
- Hey, honey.
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, baby.
Hello.
- Breakfast at Tiffany's?
- Yeah.
I just came back from Angela's.
It's not looking very good for Duncan.
Oh, that's too bad.
The doctor thinks it's just a matter of time.
Joe.
Could you..
?
Poor guy.
I hate to see him suffer like this.
- Yeah.
- You know, I'm sorry.
I hate to be one of those people but we're right in the middle of this thing.
I can't hear.
Who are you?
This is George Costanza.
It's just very hard to follow, with all the talking.
I'll pause it, okay?
Any more grape juice?
So who is this guy?
- He's in some book club.
- And what's he doing here?
Cheating on his test.
So we watching the movie or are we still talking?
Okay, come on, let's go.
What?
Come on, you took my seat.
It's not your seat.
- I was sitting there.
Come on.
- You didn't save it.
I had the arm.
Joe.
What's the difference?
I was very comfortable.
I've got my nuts here.
It's my couch.
All right, come on.
Come on, scootch over.
- Wait, it's my seat!
- Stop being like a 2-year-old.
Look!
Look what you did!
You got grape juice all over our couch.
You ruined our couch!
Joe.
- Oh, my God.
- You see?
So are you gonna get a new couch?
Well, I guess I have no choice.
- What, do you want your old couch?
- I was hoping you'd offer.
- Yeah?
- It's the movers.
- Okay.
- Who's that?
- Your boyfriend.
He's taking it out.
- No, he's not my boyfriend.
Why?
Take a guess.
Oh, really.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Hey, Carl, I also need you to go to Elaine's and bring my old couch back.
- Today?
- Could you?
- Sure.
Well, what are you doing with this couch?
George is taking it.
Did you tell him it was peed on?
He said he doesn't care.
He'll just turn the cushion over.
- I'm sorry you feel that way, Elaine.
- Yeah, me too.
- It's just too bad.
- Yeah, it is.
Well, I better get this couch back to Jerry's.
- Can I offer you anything to drink?
- Yeah, sure.
- All I've got is grape juice.
- Throw it.
The couch!
She didn't want the constraints of any relationship.
That's why she got rid of the cat.
The most important thing in Holly's life was her independence.
Well, not really.
After all, she did get together with George Peppard.
I mean, Fred.
George, Fred's gay.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
I never figured out why they make these bizarre toilet seats.
You know?
Like those clear Lucite ones with all the coins in it?
It's a lovely tribute to our past president.
It's not bad enough Lincoln got shot in the head, we gotta drop our pants and sit on it too.
It's just incomprehensible that you would buy a thing like this.
You install it on your toilet seat.
And this says what about you?
I can't afford to throw money down the toilet, but look how close I am.
I cannot believe Lindsay's seeing you after that Breakfast at Tiffany's thing.
I think she finds my stupidity charming.
- As we all do.
- Yeah.
Anyway, she's having some kind of a family lunch.
I'll swing by after.
- So you gonna meet the mother?
- I'll zip in.
"How do you do"?
- Zip out.
She'll love me.
- You're good with the mothers.
You know, I'm better with the mothers than I am with the daughters.
- Maybe you should date the mothers.
- If I could talk to the mothers and have sex with the daughters, then I'd really have something going.
- You've got something going.
- Yeah.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- You got a hammer?
- What do you need a hammer for?
I got this new poster, 3-D art.
Computers generate it.
- Yeah, I wanna see that.
Bring it over.
- I don't have it now.
I gotta pick it up at Mr. Pitt's.
Elaine was framing stuff for him so she did me a favor.
Wanna take a ride?
- No, I don't think so.
- George, you wanna go for a ride?
- No.
- Oh, come on!
Could you wait until the man finishes..
?
All right, I've had it with you two.
Hey, guess what?
Remember that woman you saw me with?
She used to be an Olympic gymnast.
- A gymnast?
- Yeah.
She's Romanian.
She won a silver at the '84 Olympics.
A gymnast, Jerry.
Think of the flexibility.
That sex will melt your face.
- Yeah, well, I think I'm bailing.
- Bailing?
Kramer, there's always a price to pay for just a sexual dalliance.
Jerry, you should pay that price.
She's Romanian.
What will I talk to her about?
Ceausescu?
Ch What?
Gymnast?
I can't believe it.
You didn't tell me she was a gymnast.
What is this?
I'm putting my shirt back on.
Back on?
What was it doing off?
I take it off when I go to the You know, to the office.
What for?
Frees me up, no encumbrances.
- Unbuttoned or all the way off?
- All the way, baby.
Of course.
Again?
Kramer, if you keep getting these attacks you should see the doctor and have it checked out.
Yeah, yeah.
- You always take the shirt off?
- Always.
I tell you, knowing you is like going into the jungle.
I never know what I'm gonna find next, and I'm real scared.
Elaine, I need you to proofread this report for my meeting with the Poland Creek bottled-water people.
- What meeting?
- I told you.
I sit on the board of trustees for Morgan Springs and we're trying to acquire Poland Creek.
Are you using a fountain pen?
- Yes.
- They smear.
Under no circumstances is ink to be used in this office.
All right, I'll use a pencil, Mr. Pitt.
- Elaine.
- Come in.
Come in.
Yeah.
Hi, right there.
Yeah.
- That's not it.
- Kramer, it's that - There she blows.
- Kramer?
Kramer, could you do this at home?
I don't think - I've got work to do, okay?
- These are nice corners.
Elaine, did I hear..
?
This is very odd.
Yeah, it's 3-D art.
Computers generate them, big computers.
Yes, I've heard about these.
How do they work?
You blur your eyes like you're staring straight through the picture and you keep your eyes unfocused.
Then Yeah!
- I don't see it.
- It's a spaceship surrounded by planets, asteroids.
- I still don't see it.
Okay.
Kramer, that's enough.
Mr. Pitt has got work to do.
You ever dream in 3-D?
It's like the boogeyman is coming right at you.
- A spaceship, where?
- Right in here.
Just keep your eyes unfocused.
- Oh, Mama.
- Kramer, what's wrong?
- Mama.
- Kramer, are you okay?
I think I got to go to the doctor.
Oh, Mama!
How long does it usually take?
George, it is so nice to finally meet you.
And I'm sorry we've kept Lindsay so long.
- Mother.
- No, no, not at all.
I have always felt that the most important thing in the world is spending time with family.
Are you and your family close?
Very close.
Almost painfully close.
Mother, I'm gonna walk Nana and Aunt Phyllis to the elevator.
George, do you mind waiting one more minute?
Mind?
Why would I mind?
I would love to wait.
Nana, nice to see you.
Nana!
Aunt Phyllis, always a pleasure, what a pleasure.
Hey, let's do this again real soon.
I had fun.
- Can I offer you anything to eat?
- No, I'm fine.
- Let me help you with these dishes.
- George, you don't have to.
No, I know I don't have to, I want to.
George, you are such a gentleman.
I'd argue if I could, Mrs. Enright.
Here we go.
All right.
Mrs. Enright!
Mrs. Enright!
Look, there's a spaceship.
That is so cool.
Where is it?
- Right here.
- I'm looking there!
- No, no, unfocus.
- I am unfocused!
Hello?
Oh, yeah.
Okay, fine.
He'll be right down.
Car's here to pick you up and take you to the meeting.
Meeting?
The Poland Creek merger.
- Why don't you go for me?
- How can I go?
All they're gonna do is read the report.
Mr. Pitt, I do not think that is just such a good idea.
Oh, damn this thing!
So Ceausescu, he must have been some dictator.
Yes, he was not shy about dictating.
He must have been dictating first thing in the morning.
- I want a cup of coffee and a muffin.
- And you could not refuse.
No, you'd have to be crazy.
- He was a very bad dictator.
- Yes.
Very bad.
Very, very bad.
So let me get this straight.
You find yourself in the kitchen.
You see an éclair in the receptacle and you think to yourself: "What the hell, I'll just eat some trash.
" No, no, no.
It was not trash.
- Was it in the trash?
- Yes.
Then it was trash.
It wasn't down in.
It was sort of on top.
- But it was in the cylinder.
- Above the rim.
Adjacent to refuse is refuse.
It was on a magazine, and it still had the doily on.
- Was it eaten?
- One little bite.
Well, that's garbage.
But I know who took the bite.
It was her aunt.
You, my friend, have crossed the line that divides man and bum.
You are now a bum.
Hey.
What's with you?
I got a stone.
- What stone?
- A kidney stone.
What is that, anyway?
It's a stony mineral concretion formed abnormally in the kidney.
And this jagged shard of calcium pushes its way through the ureter into the bladder.
It's forced out through the urine.
Boy, that's gotta hurt.
Our shareholders have given basic approval for the merger, including the stock swap.
The stock swap.
Let's swap some stock.
If you'll just give this to Mr. Pitt and tell him that we expect to be in full-scale production by the spring.
All right.
Hey, you guys, what's the name of the new company gonna be?
- Moland Spring.
- Moland?
- Yes.
We combined Morgan and Poland.
Yeah, I know, but Moland?
I wouldn't drink anything called Moland.
But it was Mr. Pitt's idea.
Well, what's in a name?
I mean, water is water, right?
We've got to do something about that name.
No, Lindsay, it was not in the garbage.
It was above the garbage.
Hovering like an angel.
Of course I know your aunt bit it.
I kissed her goodbye.
Listen, can I tell you something else?
In my family we used to eat out of the garbage all the time.
It was no big thing.
That's right.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
I'm back in.
She gave me a second chance.
- Good for you.
- Yes.
Good for me.
You know what you should do now?
Get her flowers, smooth it out.
Yes.
Flowers.
I will get her flowers.
I will go to the florist.
Behold, the games of the '84 Olympiad.
- Katya's silver-medal performance.
- Kramer, you're still on this?
I've seen gymnasts.
I know what they do.
- It's not gonna make any difference.
- Jerry, what is your problem?
Kramer, you know, guys like you with no conscience don't know what it's like for guys like me.
I'm in the unfortunate position of having to consider people's feelings.
All right, Jerry, are you familiar with the Kama Sutra?
- No.
- Tantric yoga.
- No.
- Jerry, you stand on the threshold to the magical world of sensual delights that most men dare not dream of.
Boy, you can really talk some trash.
I guess that's better than eating it.
All right, why don't we just watch the tape, huh?
- Did you pass your stone yet?
- Not yet.
But the suspense is killing me.
- Hey, that's her.
- Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah, that's her.
Look at the height, Jerry, the extension.
Watch the tuck, handstand, half turn giant into a straddle, back into another handstand nice kip, reverse hecht.
Nice leg extension.
Good form.
Here comes the big dismount.
Look at the rotation.
Full in, double back, and she sticks the landing.
Perhaps you'd like to keep the tape.
I'll take that as a yes.
Well, here we are.
Yes, we are here.
How did you stay on that beam like that?
It's only this wide.
I can balance myself in any position.
It is amazing, after years of training, how one can contort one's body.
Of course, it is only useful in gymnastics.
Oh, boy.
I couldn't believe it.
I thought I was entering a magical world of sensual delights.
It was just so ordinary.
There was nothing gymnastic about it.
What did you think she was going to do?
You know, I mean I don't know.
No, what?
- Obviously, I prefer not mention any - Did you think she was gonna take some of that chalk and - I really don't wanna get into it.
- Oh, come on.
One thing.
- You know, any kind of specifics.
One thing.
What?
Well, frankly, I thought, you know, I was gonna be like the apparatus.
You mean like the uneven parallel bars?
- Again, I don't feel like - The balance beam?
- Could we stop?
- Not the pommel horse.
Let's just drop it.
So let me ask you this.
How long would you say I have to put in now because of, you know, last night?
- I don't know, at least three weeks.
- Oh, great.
Jerry, that is such small potatoes.
I think that I may have single-handedly put the kibosh on the big water merger.
- Between Poland and Morgan?
Yeah.
Started a big name controversy.
Kramer.
The stone.
What happened?
Did you pass the stone?
No, I tried to do a reverse hecht off my couch, and I didn't make it.
You call this coffee?
Hey!
What the hell was that?
- I'm terribly sorry.
- Clean that up!
Oh, sure.
Of course.
Could you hold these for just a second?
Here you go.
Don't worry about a thing.
It's gonna be fine.
Here we go.
Look at this shine.
Look at this sparkle.
Mrs. Enright!
Mrs. Enright!
Mrs. Enright!
Lindsay, I had accidentally spilled coffee on the gentleman's windshield.
Why would I do that?
I have a job.
Well, did she see a squeegee?
You're not gonna make a dime without a squeegee.
That's right.
Just tell your mother it was all a big misunderstanding.
You won't regret it.
Okay, I'll see you later.
Bye-bye.
Strike two.
- You think I'm going down?
- You're behind in the count.
- Hey, what are you doing later?
- Going out with Katya, thanks to you.
Well, you know, maybe you should try again.
You know what happens the first time.
People are a little shy, a little reticent.
If I do it again, that extends my payment book another two weeks.
- Where are you going?
- The circus.
One of her old Olympic teammates is an acrobat.
- I don't even feel like going out.
- Jerry, it's your obligation, come on.
Yeah, well, if I gotta go and spend time with this girl you're coming with me, Dr. Cyclops.
- No, I don't wanna go to the circus.
- Yeah?
Well, you're going.
But I'm afraid of clowns.
I didn't send you over there to complain about the name.
I couldn't help it.
Moland Springs?
I like the name Moland.
I picked it out.
After all those months of negotiating.
- Well, I'm so sorry.
- Well, I'm going riding.
I haven't been on Jenny for three days.
All because of this blasted painting.
- Elaine?
- Oh, sorry.
Hello.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
So, Jerry, you're enjoying the circus?
Greatest show on earth.
My father used to take me to the circus.
When the elephants came by, he would scream curses at them blaming them for all the ills of society.
Well, they certainly take up a lot of space.
- Misha.
- Katya.
Misha, this is Jerry.
Yes, the comedian.
Oh, yes.
Yes, I'll tell him.
Yes, thank you.
Hold on, hold on.
Mr. Pitt?
I think I'm on to something.
Mr. Pitt, the board of directors is on the phone.
They've called an emergency meeting.
You need to be there to discuss the merger.
You said keep your eyes out of focus, which is misleading.
You want deep focus.
Yes, hi, okay.
Fine.
Yeah.
Hold on just a second.
Let me just Yeah, I've got it Yeah, he'll be there.
Mr. Pitt, you have got to stop staring at that poster!
I see something that could be a spaceship.
Is it round?
Is it pointed?
No!
You don't see it, and you're never gonna see it!
Mr. Pitt, you have to meet with the shareholders.
You have to leave now.
Do you hear me?
Do you hear me?
My goodness.
What's happened to me?
- When's the meeting?
- In about 20 minutes.
Do I have time to change?
- No.
- Well, excuse me.
I better get straight over there.
- Mr. Pitt - Yes?
- There's a - Is that ink?
No.
Well, here we are.
Do you wanna come in?
My mother's having a little party.
- Maybe I could just use the bathroom.
- Sure.
Ladies and gentlemen, may I direct your attention to the center ring where the incomparable Misha will balance 10 stories above the circus floor on a wire no wider than a human thumb.
It is time.
Break a leg.
- Show biz.
- Ladies and gentlemen the incomparable Misha!
Those capes are really coming back.
Sorry I took so long.
They've got one of those 3-D art posters in there.
It's mesmerizing.
What is that sound?
It is horrible.
Anybody see that poster in there?
That is weird, wild stuff, huh?
I have been accused of wrongdoing but these false accusations will not deter us.
We will annex Poland by the spring at any cost!
And our stock will rise high.
The doctor said Misha is going to be all right.
I must go and be with Misha now.
- I don't want you to come with me.
- Why not?
It has been three days since our night together.
Misha said that was all the time I needed to put in.
- Really?
- In my country they speak of a man so virile, so potent that to spend a night with such a man is to enter a world of sensual delights most women dare not dream of.
This man is known as the comedian.
You may tell jokes, Mr. Jerry Seinfeld, but you are no comedian.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Car names are so stupid, aren't they?
No baron has ever owned a LeBaron.
Or the Ford LTD.
LTD.
Limited.
It's a limited edition.
What did they make, Yes, it's limited to the number we can sell.
Or when they try and mangle a positive word into a car name.
You know how they'll do that?
The Integra.
Oh, integrity?
No, Integra.
The Supra or the Impreza.
Yeah?
Well, I hope it's not a "lemona.
" Or you'll be hearing from my "lawya.
" So, George, you sure I can't show you any other cars?
I don't think so, Vic.
Done my homework.
'89 Volvo.
That's the car for me.
It's the one I want.
I got a LeBaron convertible right here.
N.I., not interested.
Got a few more miles on it, but the previous owner was Jon Voight.
Jon Voight?
Okay, Tim, you're welcome.
- Was that Tim Whatley?
- Yes, it was.
He wanted your address.
You, my friend, are gonna be invited to his night-before-Thanksgiving party.
He's got that great apartment on 77th Street and they overlook where they inflate all those huge balloons for the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.
I have always had a big crush on Tim.
Why can't he ask me out?
He's a dentist.
You don't wanna go out with a dentist.
- Why?
- He'll always be criticizing your brushing technique.
It'll drive you crazy.
Away from the gums.
New car!
Hey!
Did you get the Volvo?
No, I decided to go with an '89 LeBaron.
A LeBaron?
I thought Consumer said Volvo was the car.
What consumer?
I'm the consumer.
Seems like a strange choice.
Well, maybe so.
But it was good enough for Mr. Jon Voight.
- Jon Voight?
The actor?
- That's right.
He just happened to be the previous owner of the vehicle.
You bought a car because it belonged to Jon Voight?
No.
No.
I think "yes, yes.
" You like the idea of telling people you're driving Jon Voight's car.
All right, maybe I do.
So what?
I've never even seen him in a car.
I mean, look at his movies.
No cars.
Deliverance, canoe.
Midnight Cowboy, boots.
Runaway Train runaway train.
Hey.
Jerry, you know that shoe repair place at the end of the block?
If they don't get business, they'll shut down and make way for one of those gourmet coffee or cookie stores.
- I like coffee.
- I like cookies.
Well, of course you do.
And you know why?
Because you're a bunch of yuppies.
It's your "go, go" corporate-takeover lifestyles that are driving out these mom-and-pop stores and destroying the fabric of this neighborhood.
Well, what's so great about a mom-and-pop store?
If my mom and pop ran a store, I wouldn't shop there.
Hey, Bucambo they've been in the neighborhood for 48 years.
Now, come on, Jerry, you gotta have shoes in need of a cobbler.
I really don't wear the kind of shoes that have to be cobbled.
Well, what about sneakers?
They'll clean them.
They do complete detailing.
- All right.
Take them.
- Yeah, yeah.
Kramer, without you, we'd be out of business.
These belong to my neighbor, Jerry Seinfeld, the comedian.
- So many sneakers.
- Well, he's got a Peter Pan complex.
They'll be ready a week from Thursday.
Oh, well, no rush.
- What's the matter?
- I keep getting these nosebleeds.
- Lie down.
And put your head back.
- Oh, yeah.
- Hey, what's with your ceiling?
- What?
You got wires sticking out every which way.
It looks dangerous.
You should call an electrician.
You know, in the 48 years we've been here I don't think we've ever called an electrician.
Well, you should.
This place could blow any minute.
- Elaine.
- Yes, Mr. Pitt?
Have you gotten all the salt off those pretzels yet?
No.
I'm still working on it.
What in blazes are you listening to?
Artie Shaw, "Honeysuckle Jump.
" That was Artie Shaw, "Honeysuckle Jump".
Elaine, how did you know that?
My father used to have a huge collection of big-band records.
Congratulations to Wayne Hopper for identifying it.
By doing so, he becomes our seventh person to man the Woody Woodpecker balloon in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.
There are only three spots left.
When we come back, you'll have three more chances to win a spot holding a rope under Woody Woodpecker.
Could you identify the next song?
Could you?
Could you?
Why would you wanna hold the ropes from the Woody Woodpecker balloon?
My father was a stern man.
He forbade us to participate in any activities that he thought were associated with the common man.
The Thanksgiving Day Parade was first on the list.
All right.
Okay.
I'll do the best I can.
Here we go for the next spot under the balloon.
If you know the name of this next song, call 555-BAND.
Well, Elaine?
Do you know it?
What song is it?
- Will you shut up?
I can't hear!
- I'm sorry.
Oh, I've got it!
It's "Next Stop, Pottersville.
" Goody!
Yes, yes!
"Next Stop, Pottersville.
" You are a genius.
You'll love this car, even if you don't like Jon Voight.
I like Jon Voight.
Just seems like a strange reason to buy a car because he might have driven it.
What do you mean, "might"?
- You don't think he really owned it?
- I don't know.
Why would the guy make up something like that?
Of all the names he could pick, why settle on Jon Voight?
Don't you see, that's the genius of it.
If he had said Liam Neeson, you'd know he's making it up.
Liam Neeson?
How are you comparing Liam Neeson with Jon Voight?
Jerry, we're talking about Joe Buck.
If you can play Joe Buck, Oskar Schindler's a cakewalk.
Oh, look at this.
I stepped in gum.
You're not getting in my car with gummy shoes.
All right.
I'll change my shoes.
Liam Neeson.
You know he's not American.
Let me get a clean pair.
Everybody's talking at me I can't hear a word they're saying Just driving round In Jon Voight's car Kramer!
Hey, where's all my sneakers?
- You said take them.
- Not all of them.
Well, obviously, there was a miscommunication.
Obviously.
So, what am I supposed to wear?
- Jerry, I left you a pair right here.
- Where?
Come on.
You're not looking.
Here.
There.
Put on those boots.
I can't wear these.
- Well, why not?
- They're uncomfortable.
Come on here.
Try them on.
Where did you get those?
I worked a club in Dallas one time, and they couldn't pay me so they gave me these.
I can't wear these.
They look ridiculous.
You look like a cowboy.
I don't wanna be a cowboy.
Oh, stop it.
You know Tim the dentist?
I got an invitation to his Thanksgiving eve party.
- Yeah?
I got one too.
- Oh, yeah?
- What?
- No.
Nothing.
- No, what is it?
- No, it's just that I didn't get one.
You didn't get one?
But he called me up and asked for yours and Elaine's addresses.
I'm sure that means I'm invited.
Not necessarily.
Why would you call someone for addresses if you're not invited to the party?
That's the genius of it.
I'm calling Elaine.
See if she can find out anything from Tim Whatley.
Hey, I got Jon Voight's LeBaron.
Boss.
Four thousand dollars!
We can't afford that.
Well, you have to do something about it because it's in violation of the building code.
Otherwise, they're gonna close you up.
Supposing we can't pay for it?
Then I have to report you.
Otherwise, I lose my license.
Sorry.
Forty-eight years, Mom.
And now we have to close.
All because of that idiot and his bloody nose.
Afternoon, Mom.
Afternoon, Pop.
You know you got a crack in the sidewalk?
You ought to get that fixed.
- So?
- Come on, put the top up.
- It's November.
- I feel alive, Jerry.
Let's check out the glove box.
Pencil.
Hey, you don't think..
?
Sure.
That's Jon Voight's pencil.
With Jon Voight's teeth marks.
Owner's manual.
You know what?
This car was owned by Jon Voight.
You see?
I told you.
Except Jon is spelled with an "H".
- J-O-H-N.
- So?
Doesn't Jon Voight spell his name J-O-N?
- So, what are you saying?
- Nothing.
I'm sure Jon probably misspelled his own name.
I know sometimes I spell Jerry with a G. And an I. - Get out of the car!
- What?
That's right, you heard me.
Get out.
You're ruining this whole experience.
Oh, look.
There's Gregory Peck's bicycle.
- Get out!
- And Barbara Mandrell's skateboard.
Get out!
Hey, cowboy.
Where's your horse?
Yeah, you better run.
- Did they take anything?
- They didn't touch me.
I tripped because of these stupid cowboy boots.
Well, anyway, again, I'm sorry about throwing you out of the car.
- You really seemed to enjoy it.
- It was kind of fun.
You know, maybe his name really is J-O-H-N but he changed it to J-O-N for show business.
Well, you know, J-O-N is a lot zippier.
Yeah, that's possible.
How would you find out something like that?
Wait a minute.
What am I thinking?
I've got the entire Yankee organization at my disposal.
- He'll dispose of it.
- That's right.
See you later.
So, Jerome, I did a little snooping around for you.
What'd you find out, Lois?
Well, I talked to Tim Whatley.
Yeah?
And I asked him, "Should Jerry bring anything"?
Subtle.
And he said, "Why would Jerry bring anything"?
All right, but let me ask you this.
Which word did he emphasize?
Did he say, "Why would Jerry bring anything"?
Or, "Why would Jerry bring anything"?
Did he emphasize "Jerry" or "bring"?
I think he emphasized "would.
" Know what?
The hell with this party.
I don't wanna go to begin with.
- Hey.
- Hey.
So where's my sneakers?
- That's what I wanna know.
- What do you mean?
Well, I saw Mom and Pop this morning but when I went by the store on my way home, the place was empty.
Everything is gone.
Mom and Pop vanished.
- So all my sneakers are gone?
- I'm afraid so.
And that's just the tip of the iceberg.
I've been asking around.
They didn't even have any kids.
Mom and Pop aren't even a mom and pop?
It was all an act, Jerry.
They conned us, and they scored bigtime.
So Mom and Pop's plan was to move into the neighborhood establish trust for 48 years and then run off with Jerry's sneakers?
Apparently.
All right.
That's enough of this.
- Where you going?
- I gotta go to the Dixieland Deli to pick up Mr. Pitt's security pass for the parade.
Why does he wanna hold a rope underneath Woody Woodpecker in the Thanksgiving Day Parade?
He finds his laugh intoxicating.
So, George, what kind of promotional events are we talking about?
- Well I think we need more special days at the stadium.
You know, like Joe Pepitone Day or Jon Voight Day.
- Jon Voight?
The actor?
I make a motion that we have no more of these meetings that have been initiated by George Costanza.
I suppose if I had suggested Liam Neeson Day you'd all be patting me on the back.
I guessed Stan Herman's "Boomtown Blues.
" - What did you guess?
- It was "Next Stop, Pottersville.
" Everybody knows that.
You know when they're giving out the passes?
After the music.
Oh, man.
Taxi!
Taxi.
Hey!
Jon Voight!
Jon Voight!
Hey, listen.
Can I ask you something?
Listen.
Do you..
?
Wait - No Jon Voight Day, huh?
- No.
Now I'll always have this doubt about the car.
- What, your jaw still hurts?
- Yeah, it's all swollen.
I think I chipped a tooth when I fell yesterday.
- Have somebody look at it.
- I'm calling dentists all day.
Nobody working the day before Thanksgiving.
- You going to the party?
- No.
I don't know if I'm invited.
- There'll be lots of dentists there.
- Yeah, you're right.
You don't wanna suffer all weekend.
Yeah, I gotta see a dentist.
This is killing me.
Well, I'll take a chance.
We'll go together.
Maybe I'll just meet you there.
- You don't wanna go with me?
- Jerry for all I know, this guy went out of his way to not invite you.
How am I gonna feel if I show up with an uninvited, unwelcome intruder?
The way I feel when I go places with you?
- Hey.
- Hey.
Did you find my sneakers yet?
No.
But I ran into somebody you might be interested in.
A Mr. Jon Voight, the actor.
Jon Voight, are you kidding me?
!
Did you talk to him?
He was a little standoffish.
What, you didn't ask him about the car?
I couldn't.
His cab pulled away.
But he did make an impression on me.
- Look.
- What?
His tooth marks.
He bit me.
- Jon Voight bit you?
- What is he, a vampire?
No, it's justifiable.
He thought I was going for his wallet.
- He left perfect imprints.
- That he did.
You've got that pencil with the bite marks on it?
We get a trained eye to match them, and we'll see if you're driving his car.
Oh, please.
Wait a minute.
Wait, it's not that stupid.
No, it's stupid.
Why?
Why is it impossible?
I mean, they're both bite marks.
So you're showing up at that party with a chewed-up pencil and Kramer's gnarled arm?
- It's worth a shot.
- Yeah.
Kramer, you wanna go to the party together?
Jerry, look, come on, I'm an invited guest.
I can't be aiding and abetting some party crasher.
Excuse me, dentist?
Dentist?
Dentist?
Are you a dentist?
Are you a dentist?
These are the balloons?
Big deal.
All I see is Woody Woodpecker.
You got a problem with Woody Woodpecker?
Yeah.
What is he, some sort of an instigator?
That's right.
He's a troublemaker.
Hey, did you get my message?
What?
I can't hear a word you're saying.
I was stuck at the Dixieland Deli all day.
My head is still ringing.
Where's Tim?
What's that, the Empire State Building?
What?
I can't hear you!
Elaine, would you marry me?
Wh..
?
I told you, I can't hear a word.
All right.
Forget it.
- Hey, Tim, how you doing?
- George.
Kramer, how you doing?
Watch Watch the arm.
Listen, we don't wanna bother you.
We know you're busy.
- No, it's okay, what is it?
- Let me show you something.
- Take a look.
- I'm gonna get going.
Let me take down your number.
- Hey, is that Jerry Seinfeld?
- Hey, he didn't come with us.
- Tim, the pencil.
- Jerry.
- Hey, Tim.
- Jerry.
I didn't think you'd show.
Did you say, "Jerry, I didn't think you'd show" or "Jerry, I didn't think you'd show.
" - Elaine, hi.
- Tim.
I'm really glad you came.
- What?
- I'm really glad you came.
Listen, Elaine, I've been wanting to ask you would you like to go out with me New Year's Eve?
Thanks.
What?
What?
Let me ask you something.
Could you tell if teeth marks on somebody's arm matched teeth marks on a pencil?
- It's possible.
- Roll up your sleeve.
Somebody bit you?
Well, not just someone.
Jon Voight.
- Jon Voight bit you?
- Yeah, yeah.
The pencil.
Get the pencil out of your mouth!
You're destroying Jon Voight's teeth marks.
- That's Jon Voight's pencil?
- That's right.
And I got his whole car downstairs.
Are you the one you bought his LeBaron convertible?
- Yes!
Yes!
- Yes!
Yes, I'm the one.
- So you know Jon Voight?
- Yes.
I went to dental school with him.
- Jon Voight, the actor?
- No.
The periodontist.
Can't this wait until Monday?
Come by my office.
- Just a quick peek.
I'm in agony.
- All right.
Sit down.
It's this one here in the back.
You popped Woody Woodpecker!
Hey, who invited you anyway?
You're a troublemaker.
Looks like Woody Woodpecker is running out of air.
In fact, he's collapsing.
Those kids look pretty disappointed.
Especially that big kid up in the front.
How old is he?
- Hello.
- Hello, is this Jerry Seinfeld?
- Yes, it is.
- You don't know me but a really strange thing happened.
I was at a garage sale, and this old couple sold me used sneakers they claimed belonged to Jerry Seinfeld, the comedian.
Could I have the address to that garage sale?
Okay, thank you very much.
I found Mom and Pop.
They're selling my sneakers.
- Where are they?
- Parsippany, New Jersey.
Let's go.
- My car's in the shop.
- How are we getting to Parsippany?
Jerry these nosebleeds are starting again.
Maybe we should get you to a hospital.
I ain't going to no Bellevue.
Look at me, I'm falling apart here.
The marching band is a perfect example of taking something bad and making it difficult too.
I mean, why does the band have to march?
We're not moving.
Maybe if they hold still, we could all leave.
Is that why they do it?
People try and get away.
"No, you don't.
I'm right with you.
Right with you, buddy.
" The human urge to wave at total strangers just moving by is very strong, isn't it?
Parades and ocean liners and those little trains that go through amusement parks.
It's always that bittersweet, kind of hello-goodbye combination wave, isn't it?
Just: I've never seen these people before in my life and they're leaving.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
If a friend gets involved in a relationship, it affects your friendship.
Because you're like a comedy team, and now there's this third person.
It kind of throws off the timing: "Who's on first"?
"I don't know.
Dear, who do you think is on first"?
Whenever a friend starts with a new girlfriend, he should just say: "I look like the person you used to know but I've been modified to survive in this relationship.
In other words, if we're having an argument and she's there I may say, 'I totally disagree with you.
' But what that means is: 'I'd like to help you out, but I'd rather continue to see her naked.
"' Okay, cowboys, what will you have?
I'll have the turkey club without the bacon.
And I'll have the bacon club without the turkey.
George, don't make me get tough with you.
Why?
You think you can beat me up?
You wouldn't want me to mess up that beautiful face of yours.
Stop it.
Stop it.
You don't want bacon.
I'll surprise you.
- Is she not terrific?
- She does have a way.
You think she thinks I have a beautiful face?
Well, they do work on tips.
"George, don't make me get tough with you.
" Who says that?
She is really cool.
What do you think?
You think she likes me?
I should've got the egg-white omelet.
Why should she like me?
Who am I?
There's a million people to like.
The omelet.
Damn.
Maybe she could like me.
Is it that far-fetched?
Maybe she sees something.
Is it possible?
- No.
Not possible.
- No.
Not possible.
- Hey.
- Hey, Laney.
- How was the trip?
- What trip?
You were gone?
I went to England.
With Mr. Pitt, for five days?
- How was it?
- Actually, it was great.
I met an Englishman, and we really hit it off.
Well, that relationship has obviously got a lot of potential.
Yeah, well, Jerome I happen to be flying him in on my frequent-flier miles.
Flying him in?
How long is he staying for?
It's an open-ended ticket.
He can return anytime he wants.
All this in five days.
Oh, no.
It's Kenny Bania.
- Who's he?
- He's this awful comedian.
- Hey, Jerry.
- Hey, Kenny.
- Elaine, George.
- Hi.
- How's it going?
- Great.
I've been working out.
Went from a size 40 to a 42.
- No kidding?
- Yeah.
I'm huge.
- Well, I'll leave you guys alone.
- Okay, thanks.
Oh, Jerry, you know what just hit me?
I was thinking - What size suit are you?
- I'm a 40.
Why?
I just got a brand-new Armani suit, doesn't fit me anymore.
You want it?
Well, I don't know if Oh, come on.
Why should it sit in a closet?
- An Armani suit?
- Take the suit.
Well, okay, I guess.
- You gonna be home later?
- Yeah.
I'll drop it off.
- Hey, new suit!
- Yeah, yeah.
Lucky me.
Here, I personally made you a cold chicken sandwich.
It's not even on the menu.
Oh, this is fabulous.
Boy, she is nice.
I like her.
I like her, Jerry.
She's got substance.
She oozes substance.
Well, go in there and talk to her.
She's not gonna put them on the glass.
You mean the walk back in?
That's the toughest move in the business.
You're sending me into no man's land and if I get shot down, I have to crawl back.
Well, I can't do it, I tell you!
Pull yourself together.
You're going in there, soldier.
That's an order!
Get in there.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Listen, I need you to do me a favor.
- What?
- Help me move my refrigerator.
- Why?
- Because I'm getting rid of it.
- Yeah?
- It's K.B. I have the suit.
All right, come on up.
- So - Why get rid of your refrigerator?
After that kidney stone, I only want fresh food.
It's gotta be fresh.
I'm not eating any more stored food.
Plus, you know, I want the space.
- What for?
- Well, I could put a dresser in there.
I could get dressed while I'm making breakfast.
Hey!
- Here you go.
- Yeah.
Didn't think I was really gonna give you a suit, did you?
- You're giving him this suit?
- That's right.
And it's Armani.
Armani?
- Hey, Armani, Jerry.
- Yes, yes, I heard.
- Come on, try it on.
- No, it's okay.
- Come on.
I want to see how it fits.
- All right.
- There you go.
- There, okay?
Oh, boy.
Look at that.
That looks great.
- I can't believe you're giving him this.
- And I don't even want anything for it.
- He's very generous, isn't he?
- Yes.
Yes, he is.
I'll tell you what, you can take me out to dinner sometime.
- Dinner?
- Yeah, you buy me a meal.
- Can't get a better deal than that.
- You'll never get a better deal.
- All right, I'll leave you alone.
- Yeah, yeah.
Look at that.
Armani.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's a deal.
That's a terrible deal.
I don't want to go out to dinner with him.
I'd rather make my own suit.
- I did it.
It's all done.
- Hey.
I did it.
We're going out as soon as she gets off work.
And it'll still be daytime.
I'm better in the daytime than at night.
It's less pressure.
I love the day date.
- No wine, no shower.
- There you go.
- So the trip was good?
- Yes.
Apart from that dreadful airline food.
Wreaked absolute havoc with my stomach.
You know, I have to say, I've never admitted this to anyone but I kind of like airline food.
That's probably because of What?
- What?
- Yeah, what?
What?
Where I come from, we don't say "what.
" It's proper to say "pardon.
" Oh, this should be interesting.
- Pardon?
- Nothing.
So then, about a year ago, I started selling these funky little hair clips.
It's going pretty good.
I make them in my apartment.
I'm just waitressing because I wanted to go to Europe this summer and I could use a few extra Careful.
Oh, it's just horse manure.
Horse manure's not that bad.
I don't even mind the word "manure.
" You know, it's "nure," which is good and a "ma" in front of it.
Manure.
When you consider the other choices, "manure" is actually pretty refreshing.
- That's a nice watch, George.
- Yeah.
You know, my boyfriend has the same one.
- Really?
- Yeah, he loves watches.
- He's a real watch freak.
- Well, how about that?
- Oh, look out.
You stepped right in it.
- Yes.
I sure did.
So you just pretended it didn't bother you?
What is that?
Boyfriend?
I don't understand that.
What does she think I asked her out for?
It's the way they just slip it in there too.
Yeah, like it's all just part of the conversation.
"My boyfriend really likes watches.
He's a real watch freak.
" Well, that's fabulous.
Well, let me ask you this.
What exactly did you say when you asked her out?
I said, "Would you like to go for a walk or something"?
- Oh, a walk?
Well - Or something.
I said "or something.
" Or something?
- Yeah, that's a date.
- There you go.
Of course, there is always the possibility that she called an audible.
- What do you mean?
- She got to the line of scrimmage didn't like the looks of the defense and changed the play.
I think things were going okay.
We were having a nice conversation.
I mentioned how I liked horse manure.
- You did?
- Yeah.
- You said you liked horse manure?
- Yeah.
You know, about how, when you break it down, it's really a very positive thing.
You know, you have a "nure" with a "ma" in front of it.
Manure.
It's not bad.
And it was around this point she mentioned the boyfriend?
Yeah.
Oh, you think because of what I said about the manure?
I was just saying how it takes a negative thing and puts a positive spin on it.
I'm just saying there's a chance she may not have been enamored with your thoughts and feelings on manure.
So you don't think she really has a boyfriend.
My honest opinion?
I think she made it up.
Well, then she's just a liar, isn't she?
Hey.
You want something to eat, don't you?
Oh, no, no, no.
You got me all wrong, buddy.
I am loving this no refrigerator.
You know what I discovered?
I really like depriving myself of things.
It's fun.
Very monastic.
- Well, what do you eat?
- It's all fresh.
Fresh fish, fresh fowl, fresh fruit.
I buy it.
I eat it.
- Well, I'm glad it's working out.
- Oh, yeah.
It's working out.
And I got a date with that waitress who works at Reggie's.
Boy, if I could meet a hostess, we could open up our own place.
Yeah.
Well, I'll tell you, she's a full-figured gal.
- Is she?
- Oh, you better believe it, buddy.
- George, we could double sometime.
- Yeah, yeah, we could.
You know, Kramer, the next time you talk to her find out if she knows Kelly from Monk's.
I want to know if she really has a boyfriend.
All right, let's get over here.
- Hello.
- Hi, Jerry.
It's Kenny.
- Oh, hi.
- I was thinking, if you're not busy maybe I can get my meal today?
Yeah, you want to get that meal, don't you?
How about Mendy's.
Ever been there?
- No, I haven't.
- You're gonna love it.
- I'll meet you there around 7.
- All right.
Yeah, I really needed that suit.
I start off with curls.
That's good for the bicep.
I do 10 reps, two sets.
That's fantastic.
- You work out with weights?
- I don't.
- You should.
- Why?
- You worn the suit yet?
- No, not yet.
- Have you decided?
- Oh, get the swordfish.
Best swordfish in the city.
The best, Jerry.
I'll have the salmon.
And you?
You know what I think?
I'm just gonna have soup.
Yeah, I'll save the meal for another time.
Another time?
What other time?
I had a hot dog earlier.
I'm not that hungry.
No, no, Bania, no.
This is the dinner.
The soup counts.
Soup's not a meal.
You're supposed to buy me a meal.
I'm not stopping you from eating.
Go ahead.
Get anything you want.
- But I don't want anything but soup.
- Then that's the meal.
But I had the hot dog.
Who told you to have a hot dog?
Hey, I give you a brand-new Armani suit and you won't even buy me a meal.
All right, fine.
Get the soup.
So he just gets soup.
He wants to save the meal.
So now I got to do it all over again.
What kind of soup did he get?
I don't know.
Consommé or something.
- Consommé.
- What?
Well, that's really not a meal, Jerry.
I mean, if he had gotten chicken gumbo or matzo ball even mushroom barley, then I would agree with you.
Those are very hearty soups.
- You're missing the whole point.
- What?
The meal is the act of sitting down with him.
It doesn't matter what you get.
As long as he's sitting in that restaurant, it's a meal.
- Was it a cup or a bowl?
- You see?
Again.
- I'm just curious.
- A bowl, okay?
Did he crumble any crackers in it?
Did he crumble any crackers in it?
As a matter of fact, he did.
Oh, well, crackers in a bowl.
That could be a meal.
It's like I'm talking to my aunt Sylvia here.
- Hi, Simon.
This is Jerry.
- Hello.
- Elaine, do you have cash on you?
- Yeah, in my purse.
No, there was only $6.
Well, I have some money.
What do you need?
Twenty should cover me.
Thanks, mate.
- Where are you going?
- Just visiting.
- Okay.
See you later.
- I won't be back for dinner.
Pardon?
- So is she working?
Is she here?
- Yeah, yeah, she's here.
- Have you said anything?
- No.
I'm very uncomfortable.
- Are you gonna say anything?
- I don't know.
I don't know.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Well, what's it going to be?
- "What's it gonna be"?
- Yes.
What will you have?
Are you eating?
It's in that vein.
- I'll just have a bowl of chili.
- I'll have an egg-white omelet.
- "What's it gonna be"?
Hear that?
- Yeah, that was bad.
Did you feel that tension?
We used to have banter.
There's no more banter.
Oh, no.
It's Kenny.
Slide out so he can't sit here.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- You worn the suit yet?
- Actually I did.
I put it on last night and slept in it.
- You did?
- No, I'm joking.
Can I squeeze in?
Sure you can.
Thanks.
- Can I take your order?
- What kind of soup do you have?
Why don't you get a sandwich.
Okay.
I'll have tomato soup and tuna on toast.
Okay.
This is it, you know.
This is the meal.
So stock up, buddy boy.
What are you talking about?
This isn't a meal.
Yes, it is.
Soup and sandwich.
That is a meal.
You're supposed to buy me dinner in a nice restaurant like Mendy's.
- I tried to do that.
- This is lunch in a coffee shop.
It doesn't matter.
This is it.
This completes the transaction.
Oh, soup and a sandwich for a brand-new Armani suit.
- Is that any kind of a gesture?
- I'm really not comfortable Hey, I just spoke to Hildy about your friend.
- Yeah?
- She doesn't have a boyfriend.
She made it up.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Where's Simon?
- Oh, he'll be right up.
He's just getting some beer.
And I'm not expecting any change.
- When's he leaving?
- About two days.
Although he's hinting at how he'd like to stay.
Fortunately, he has no money and no prospects.
- Hey, mate.
Fancy a beer?
- No, thanks.
Hello?
No, I'm sorry, Bania.
I'm not going over this again.
Well, who told you to order soup?
No, there's no dinner.
There's not going to be any dinner.
You've had a sandwich and two bowls of soup, and that's it.
Goodbye.
- Hey, what size suit are you?
- Forty.
Forty.
Perfect.
- Brand-new Armani suit, you want it?
- Absolutely.
Great.
It's yours.
I can't stand the sight of it.
- Elaine, here's the car keys.
- Thanks.
- Yep.
- Listen, Jerry.
I been doing some thinking.
I want my suit back.
I don't have your suit.
I gave it away.
- Well, it's my suit.
- Well, it's gone.
I'm sorry.
Goodbye, Bania.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Yeah.
- Well, how's everything?
- Okay.
Good.
- What's going on?
- Nothing.
Really?
You want food, don't you?
It's not for me, it's for Hildy, the waitress I was telling you about.
She's hungry.
She wants food.
If I go back in there without any food, there's gonna be trouble.
All right, go ahead.
- Did you find anything?
- Yeah.
There's a few things in here.
Peanut butter, cheese.
Yeah.
- Cheese is good.
What kind?
- Swiss.
All right, it'll have to do.
Come on.
What are you doing out here?
I can't go in there.
I'm too uncomfortable.
So we're not gonna go in there anymore?
Hey, what are you doing out here?
We can't eat here anymore, because he took a waitress for a walk.
What's the difference?
Let's go to Reggie's.
- Reggie's?
I can't eat anything there.
- It's the same menu.
There's no big salad.
They'll make you a big salad.
What do you think, they're the only ones that make a big salad?
All right, let's go to Reggie's.
So, what's going on with Simon?
Did he leave?
Wait till you hear this.
So Simon picks this woman up right in front of me.
Look at this.
They make a point of saying on the menu: "No egg-white omelets.
" Look at that.
So what?
Have a yolk.
It won't kill you.
- Hello.
- Oh, hi, Hildy.
Could I get an egg-white omelet?
- Did you read the menu?
- All right.
Just give me a western.
- How about a big salad?
- A big salad?
- You see?
- Just tell her what you want.
They'll make it for you.
It's a salad, only bigger, with lots of stuff in it.
I can bring you two small salads.
Could you put it in a big bowl?
We don't have big bowls.
- All right, just give me a cup of decaf.
- We have Sanka.
I mean, it's not fair.
I've been going there for seven years.
- She's been there three weeks.
- Not fair.
If anyone should be forced to leave, it should be her.
She's on your turf.
If only she could get fired.
Is there any way that could happen?
I mean, I know how to get myself fired.
- You're the best.
- Well How do I get someone else fired?
Well, as I see it you've got to apply the same principles that get you fired but redirected outwardly.
- Hey.
- Hey.
She's hungry, Jerry.
Well, there's nothing left.
There's no food.
No food?
Well, you gotta have something.
I can't go back in there with no food.
She expecting something, Jerry.
You don't know what she's like when that blood sugar drops.
There, you see, she's already in a bad mood.
She just got fired.
Why did she get fired?
Because I called over there a couple of times and the manager didn't like it.
Simon is definitely going back now.
He's meeting me here to return my keys.
Boy, he's a real bounder, isn't he?
Yes, he's one of those bounders.
- Egg-white omelet, big salad.
- Thank you.
I wanted you guys to know that Friday is my last day.
Bloomingdale's ordered a bunch of my clips.
Thank God.
I don't have to do this anymore.
Hey, Jerry.
Where's my suit?
I don't have it.
You want half my omelet?
I told you, she's busy.
She can't come to the phone now.
Tell your boyfriend to stop calling here.
He's not my boyfriend.
It's that bald guy with the glasses who's always here with them.
He's trying to get me in trouble.
Hey!
Yeah.
I got a message for you.
You tell your friend George that the next time I see him around here I'm gonna turn him into my own personal hand puppet.
Well, hello.
Here you are, as promised.
You see, I'm a man of my word.
- When are you leaving?
- Are you trying to get rid of me?
I was supposed to leave tomorrow, but I've been set up with a job interview that might enable me to extend my visit indefinitely.
And it is all due to this suit.
How do I look?
I'm a shoo-in, aren't I?
Thanks again, hon.
Hey, Kenny.
You still wanna get that suit back?
- Yeah.
- There it goes.
Hey!
Hey!
Come here, you.
- Wait, what are you..
?
Unhand me!
- Take it off!
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
What's supposed to be so attractive about fur?
Why does a man wanna see a woman in fur?
Men want women with shaved legs, shaved armpits, plucked eyebrows.
Then before we go out, we dress them up like a bear?
To me, the only reason to wear fur would be if you were trying to sneak up on another animal.
You ever see those tribal hunters wearing the fur with the other animal's head on top of their head, you know?
I'm sure there's a moose looking at that going, "Yeah.
That looks good.
Yeah.
I'm gonna turn my back on this goofball with the extra head because there's nothing fishy there.
I'll just keep drinking from the stream.
I've seen a lot of two-headed tigers with knees.
" So I am actually gonna have a secretary.
- And I get to do the interview.
- It's incredible.
You were taking messages for your mother.
And now someone's gonna be taking messages for me.
From your mother.
So this woman you plan on hiring is she gonna be in the spokesmodel category?
Sure, I could go the tomato route but I've given this a lot of thought, Jerry.
All that frustration, I'll never get any work done.
So I'm doing a complete 360.
I'm going for total efficiency and ability.
That's a 180, George.
Whatever.
- Hi, Willie.
- Hey, Jerry.
I got this stuff and my mother's fur for storage.
- What are you doing with it?
She keeps it with me for when she comes up from Florida.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Jerry, you know my wife, Donna.
Yeah.
That's why I said "hi.
" Hey, nice jacket.
Thanks.
Houndstooth.
This is a beauty.
- Great cut.
It's probably very flattering.
- Oh, yes.
It really accentuates my bust line.
Well, I type about I'm completely well-versed in all the IBM and Macintosh programs.
Well, Miss Coggins, you're obviously qualified for the job.
You have all the necessary skills and experience but you're extremely attractive.
You're gorgeous.
I'm looking at you, I can't even remember my name.
So I'm afraid this is not gonna work out.
Thanks for coming.
You're luscious.
You're ravishing.
I would give up red meat just to get a glimpse of you in a bra.
I'm terribly sorry.
Terribly sorry.
As you can see, my references are impeccable.
I think I'd be a real asset here.
My only concern is, I do take care of my mother.
So will there be many late nights?
I can't imagine.
Okay.
So Barneys is having this huge sale.
I try this dress on.
Stunning.
Stunning.
I couldn't take my eyes off myself.
- Yeah?
- Okay.
So then I put it on at home it looks like I'm carrying twins.
So you're saying, store, hotsy-totsy, Home, hotsy-notsy.
Yeah, exactly.
Anyway, I gotta go there and return it.
I thought we were going to the movies.
All right.
I'll try it on again.
You tell me what you think.
- Hey, hey.
- Hey, George.
Hey, Elaine.
I am telling you, Jerry, having a secretary is incredible.
Don't know why I didn't have one before.
Because you didn't have a job?
Perhaps.
I walk in, everything is organized.
Messages, appointments.
I can't tell you how proud I am of myself for going with Ada.
A lesser man would've crumbled.
They would've gone for the dish and the sure-fire sexual harassment suit.
- It's a little - All right.
You answered it right there.
You got no waist in that thing.
And your arms look like something hanging in a kosher deli.
I said, all right.
- Well, why'd you buy it for?
- Why did I buy it?
Because in the mirror at Barneys, I looked fabulous.
This woman who was just walking by said I looked like Demi Moore in Indecent Proposal.
How fast was she walking?
"Demi"?
I thought it was "Demi.
" No, I think it's "Demi.
" Really?
I never heard of a "semi" tractor-trailer.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
I know what's going on here.
- Skinny mirrors.
- What?
Skinny mirrors.
Barneys has skinny mirrors.
They make you look, like, 10 pounds lighter.
Oh, you're crazy.
Am I?
Do you think I would've bought this dress if I looked like this at Barneys?
You know, I think she may have something.
What are you all dressed up for?
I'm returning this dress to Barneys.
Good idea.
Do it tomorrow.
We'll go to the movies.
- Yeah.
Okay.
- Hey, if you're going maybe you can pick me up some of this super-hydrating It's a total-protection moisturizer with UVA.
Yeah.
- Moisturizer?
That's girl stuff.
- No.
Look, I'll tell you what.
- They're having a sale, right?
- Yeah.
I'll meet you down there.
We'll have lunch.
- Well, we could - Yeah, we'll get to know each other.
We never get to spend any time together.
Oh, sure.
We have our little group here, but And then, assuming the strike is resolved on April 14th, we play the Angels.
So let's clear a floor at the Anaheim Hotel.
Anaheim Hotel.
You may wanna reconsider.
I believe they only have room service until 10 p. m then it's only finger foods.
Ada, you're a wonder.
Okay.
Now, I projected those figures for you regarding the switch to canola oil for stadium popcorn.
And surprisingly, it'll only cost half a cent more per bag so it is definitely doable.
Ada, I have to tell you, I have never met anybody so efficient.
Well, thank you.
I'm flattered.
You're just a marvel of organization.
Well, I'm just doing my job.
It's like I'm I'm thinking of something and you're one step ahead of me.
What can I say?
I'm I'm good at what I do.
Do you..
?
Do you know what I'm thinking about now?
Yes.
I think I do.
Is it doable?
It's definitely doable.
Well, that was the worst.
I can't believe they made the wife the killer.
- Give me a break.
- Hey.
Give us a break.
We haven't seen it yet.
- Thanks a lot, bigmouth.
- Yeah.
- You got a pen?
- Yeah.
I think I do.
And I need something to write on.
Well, all I got is my dry-cleaning stub.
I just met Uma Thurman.
She's giving me her telephone number.
Uma, Jerry.
Uma.
- Uma Thurman?
Really?
- How'd you manage that?
Yeah.
Well, I I don't have any time to talk now.
He's got the kavorca.
- Hey, isn't that Willie, my dry cleaner?
- Where?
He just went in.
You know, I I think he was wearing my houndstooth jacket.
What would he be doing wearing your jacket?
It looked just like the jacket I brought in to be dry-cleaned.
He complimented me on it.
- Are you sure?
- I got it.
Uma, Uma, Uma.
- You are amazing.
- Yeah.
All right.
Taxi's on me.
No, no, no.
A better way to reach the bra would be to undo the jacket then go around the back of the shirt.
Ada, you're incredible.
Here.
I wanna show you something.
Hand me that pillow.
Here.
What?
Oh, my God.
Mr. Costanza.
Ada.
- I'm giving you a raise!
- Yes!
So you're having sex, then all of a sudden you just blurt out: "I'm giving you a raise"?
Yeah.
Just a quick sidebar here.
Are you in any way authorized to give raises?
- Not that I'm aware of.
- No.
So you're so grateful to have sex, you'll shout out anything that comes into your head.
I didn't think ahead.
Well, maybe she'll just think it was bawdy talk.
I didn't say any other bawdy things.
Maybe you could have sex with her again and then take it back.
All right.
You're not any help at all here.
I don't know the point of talking to you.
All right, all right, I'm sorry.
Yeah.
Well, the only thing I can do is to go to George Steinbrenner and tell him he has to give her a raise.
- How long has she been there?
- Three days.
- It's almost a week.
- Yeah.
Oh, my God.
- What?
- It's a movie stub from the 9:30 show.
George, I think Willie the dry cleaner's been wearing my clothes.
These mirrors are skinny mirrors.
This is false reflecting.
And I think that the department of you know, whatever would be very interested to know what's going on here.
Well, we're more than happy to exchange it for something else.
Okay.
Fine.
I did like that little Calvin Klein number right by the elevator, with the little - I'll bring it to your dressing room.
- Okay.
Thanks so much.
What are you all dressed up for?
Well, Elaine, when you're shopping on Madison Avenue you don't wanna skimp on the swank.
I like your little bag.
Oh, yeah.
Hey, look at this.
This is a super-hydrating, triple-action moisturizer, huh?
Wait till that Uma smells this UVA.
- Hey, Kramer.
- Hey, Bania.
What's happening?
I'm looking for a new suit, but I can't find anything I like.
- That's a nice suit.
- Well, thank you.
- Did you get that here?
- No, no, no.
This is vintage.
They don't make this stuff anymore.
- You're telling me.
- I sure am.
It's hard to find pants - That don't make you high-waisted?
- Yes.
- Me too.
- What size are you?
- Forty-two.
- Forty-two?
That's what I am now.
I've been working out.
I'm huge.
How'd you like to sell it?
Make me an offer.
- One hundred bucks.
- Surely you jest.
One seventy-five?
Look at the stitching.
This is old-world craftsmanship.
- Three hundred dollars.
- Sold.
- Follow me into the dressing room.
- You'll throw the shirt in?
Bania, you're killing me.
Hey, that's the women's dressing room.
There's nothing there I haven't seen before.
Mr. Steinbrenner?
Can I talk to you for a second?
Yes.
Yes, George.
Can you talk to me?
Of course you can.
I'm a very accessible man.
I just wanna say you're doing great on that canola-oil stuff.
Well, you know, to be honest, sir, my My new secretary, Ada, came up with that one.
Ada.
Ada.
I like that name, George.
She supports her whole family.
- Is that a fact, George?
- Yes.
In fact, her mother's in the hospital.
It's some kind of a diverticulitis.
I had a bout of that myself one time, knocked me right on my ass.
She can't even afford to go out to lunch.
She She's been eating in high school cafeterias.
She pretends to be a teacher.
It's pathetic.
What does that cost?
Two and a quarter?
You know, I was just thinking that she could really use a raise.
She'd be better off making a sandwich and bringing it.
Hello?
George, will you excuse me?
Kramer.
What are you doing?
Listen, I need you to get me some clothes.
- What?
- Yeah.
I just sold my suit to Bania for a cool 300.
So go buy a new one.
At this place?
It would destroy my profit margin.
- So?
- Listen, do me a favor.
Just call Jerry.
Tell him to bring me some clothes.
- Hello, Willie.
- Hey, Jerry.
- You're dropping off.
- No but seen any good movies lately?
- You came by to ask that?
- Yeah.
Specifically, 9:30 shows.
Seen any good 9:30 shows at the Paragon, Willie?
- What are you getting at?
- I saw you stepping out with my houndstooth jacket.
Jerry, that's a breach of the dry cleaners' code.
You need a code to tell you not to wear people's clothes?
I wasn't wearing your jacket.
- Jerry, you're imagining things.
- Yeah.
Am I imagining this?
Found that little cutie in the pocket.
- Jerry, I - Yeah.
Well, now that we understand each other, I'll take my business elsewhere.
- I want my mother's fur coat back too.
- Jerry, come on.
- Now.
- Now?
Yeah.
I want that coat.
- Well - Where's the ticket?
- Kramer.
- Wait a minute.
You mean to tell me that you don't have a ticket for the coat?
No.
Not on me.
Well, I need to see that ticket.
Why?
I've gotten cleaning without it.
Yeah, but this is different.
Those fur-storage warehouses are huge.
You can't get anything without a number.
All right.
I'll be back.
Yeah.
It looks good here, but what does that mean?
So do you want it?
I don't know.
I have to think about it.
I need a nonpartisan mirror.
I can't thank you enough, Mr. Costanza.
- I'm so grateful.
- Yes.
Well I sat down with Mr. Steinbrenner.
I told him you have been doing great work.
I said that you deserved a raise, and if you didn't get it that I was leaving.
It was just so generous.
Oh, don't worry about it.
He's got plenty of money.
Oh, I know, but 25,000.
- So you got a $25,000-a-year raise?
- Yes.
- Oh, I tell you, Mr. Steinbrenner - You're making more than I am.
- I am?
- A secretary cannot make more than her boss.
- Well, apparently they can.
Oh, this is insanity.
I'm not this hip-y.
Hey.
Hey, what do you think of this?
You'll never pull it off.
Hey.
What's going on in there?
Excuse me.
Could you tell me where I could find women's moisturizer lotions?
This woman's been in there for over an hour.
Excuse me, miss.
Is everything okay in there?
Yeah.
- Kramer?
- Jerry.
You got my clothes?
- What clothes?
- Didn't Elaine call you?
No.
Well, what are you doing here?
What am I doing here?
You're in the women's dressing room.
I need that ticket stub back so I can get my mother's fur coat out.
The stub.
Yeah.
I left it in my My pants.
- Where are your pants?
- Well, I sold them to Bania.
What?
You sold your pants to Bania?
Let me in.
Why'd you sell your pants to Bania?
I had Uma Thurman's number written on that stub.
I lost Uma's number.
- Where are your clothes?
- I told you, I sold them to Bania.
- You mean, what you were wearing?
- Yeah.
How'd you expect to get out of here?
Well, I didn't think ahead.
This This isn't gonna work for me.
So if you could show me something else.
No.
- No?
- No.
Because you're taking that one.
- I am?
- Yes.
You wore it outside.
That's preposterous.
Well, I suppose that salt stain came from all the snow in the store.
Shall I wrap it, or will you wear it out?
No.
You can wrap it.
- Kramer, you still in there?
- Elaine?
Jerry?
- Elaine, where's Kramer?
- Bania?
- Kramer?
- I'm going out.
- Jerry.
- Bania.
Kramer, I want my money back for this suit.
Your nancy-boy cream leaked all over the pockets.
- Suit's ruined.
- You're not getting any money back.
- Jerry, come back.
- Excuse me.
- Uma's number's on that ticket.
- Never mind Uma.
I need that ticket to get my mother's coat.
Why not just give him the money?
I'm not giving him $300 now for a suit with moisturizer cream all over it.
- I got an idea.
- What?
I can't believe I'm gonna do this.
Can I talk to you for a second?
How's everything going?
- Pretty good.
- Yeah.
See, the thing is, I'm in an awkward position here because I don't wanna get between you two guys but I need a dry-cleaning ticket that's in the pocket of those pants.
All you gotta do is tell Kramer to give me my money back and you'll get your ticket.
- Yeah.
Yeah, all right.
Well, tell you what I will do, Bania.
You give me the ticket and I will take you out for a nice dinner.
Can we go back to Mendy's?
You wanna go to Mendy's, I'll take you to Mendy's.
- Twice.
I wanna go twice.
- All right, let's be reasonable, Bania.
I'm taking you out for dinner.
All I want is a little ticket.
- I think that's a pretty good deal.
- Two Mendy's.
All right.
- Just give me the ticket.
- Here you go.
But, Mr. Steinbrenner, how can I be expected to perform my job properly knowing that my subordinate is making more money than I am?
With all due respect, sir, it's out of whack.
I understand what you're saying.
I know what it's like to be strapped.
As a young man in Cleveland, I hitchhiked to work.
One time I got picked up by a bakery truck.
Think that smells good?
Try being cooped up in one of those babies.
I couldn't look at a doughnut for two years.
Not that I was ever one for the sweets.
Sure, I like a cupcake every now and then like everybody else.
You know, I like it when they have a little cream inside.
It's a surprise.
That's good.
Plus, the chocolate ones are good too.
Sometimes I can't even make up my mind.
A lot of times, I'll mix the two together.
Make a vanilla-fudge.
Let me in, it's me.
Here.
You don't know what this is costing me.
All right.
Nice work.
Wait.
Where's Uma's number?
The moisturizer smudged out the phone number.
The dry-cleaning number's gone too.
It must have been the botanical extracts.
Give me that.
Hey, Bania, the dinner's off.
The ticket's no good.
The numbers are all smudged out.
You trying to get out of Mendy's?
- You can't do that.
- The ticket is worthless.
You promised me.
Hey, isn't that my mother's fur coat?
- No, it's not.
- It is.
- Give me that back.
- What are you talking about?
- You out of your mind?
- Are you crazy, taking my coat?
What, do you think the dry cleaners is your personal closet?
Hey, Donna, can you get the salt stain out of this?
Let me see.
Piece of cake.
Bring it in.
What size is it?
This soup is great.
Yeah, it's very good.
I told you Mendy's had the best pea soup.
The best, Jerry.
The best.
- Are you enjoying it?
- Yeah.
I'm having a wonderful time.
Wait till you try the swordfish.
You know, Jerry, I was thinking for our next meal, do you think we should come here or should we go someplace else?
It has its pros and cons.
On the one hand, here, you're guaranteed a great meal.
- On the other hand - Yeah, yeah, I know.
This would be good, but it'd be the same.
If we go someplace else, it would be different, but maybe not as good.
It's a gamble.
I get it.
Yeah.
Let's hurry.
I gotta go.
I'm meeting a woman for a drink.
- Oh, and who might that be?
- Some woman named Uma.
I got her number off that ticket before it was smudged.
Hope she's good-looking.
If you are a waiter or a waitress and you see me in a restaurant I'm telling you right now, I don't wanna hear about the specials.
I don't wanna know about the specials, I'm sick of the specials, I hate them.
My feeling is, if the specials were so special, they'd be on the menu.
You know what's special?
They don't know if anybody likes them.
And they always have those overly creative descriptions of the specials.

{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Tennis is the only sport where the uniform is what you'd wear under your clothes in any other sport.
You're actually out there in your underwear.
Unless in the old days, they would wear those long pants and the big heavy sweaters.
How long did it take them to get over that?
We're out here in the hot sun, running after a ball.
What exactly are we all dressed up for?
That's why they started keeping score like that.
Point?
You know what?
Make it 15.
I'm dying in this sweater here.
Another one got by me?
Take another 10 points.
Let's just get this over with.
- Come on, let's go.
- No, wait.
I gotta go in here.
- I gotta pick up Mr. Pitt's racket.
- What's it doing here?
He wanted to have it re-strung.
I need to pick that up.
- Hello.
- Oh, hi.
- Jocelyn Landis from Doubleday.
- Yes.
I interviewed you for a position a couple of months ago.
Yes.
The one I didn't get.
I was watching you play.
Oh, I'm not very good.
No, you exhibited a lot of grace out there.
- Really?
Grace?
- Yes.
So have you found anything yet?
- No.
Not really.
- You know, you should keep in touch.
Something may be opening up in a few weeks.
Is that a Bruline?
Oh, Bruline.
Newman's got the same one.
- Newman plays tennis?
- He's fantastic.
Would you mind if I tried this out?
No.
Take it.
How will you get it back?
Well, I could come by your office and pick it up tomorrow.
That's so generous of you.
Thanks.
- You loaned her Pitt's racket?
- What could I do?
She said there might be something for me at Doubleday.
Wouldn't that be great?
I wouldn't have to work for Mr. Pitt anymore.
- I gotta get going.
- Oh, okay.
Next time let's play Ping-Pong.
It's easier to jump over the net.
Yeah.
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.
Have you noticed that she never laughs?
- Really?
- Yeah.
Think about it.
You're not gonna believe this.
There she is.
Check that out.
- You're dating this woman?
- That's right.
George, you're becoming one of the glitterati.
- What's that?
- You know, people who glitter.
- She's a slim gal.
- Yeah.
And the amazing thing is she eats like there's no tomorrow.
I've never seen an appetite like this.
Desserts, everything.
- I don't know how she does it.
- Maybe she's bulimic.
- What?
- Bulimic, you know?
- Kramer, she's a model.
- Exactly.
Well, I have noticed she does tend to go to the bathroom right after we finish eating.
- Yeah.
There you go, monkey boy.
Come on.
That's so good.
How's that?
Aren't you hungry?
Just enjoying watching you.
- So did you like the movie?
- Yeah, it was okay.
Frankenstein didn't seem quite right to me.
I missed the sport jacket.
Not that it was that nice of a jacket.
I mean, it didn't fit him that well.
To me there's just something about a monster in a blazer.
It shows at least he's making an effort.
That's funny.
I'm glad you enjoyed it.
I'm so full.
Yes.
Full.
Love to be full.
Love to just sit back, loosen the old belt and digest away for hours.
Let those enzymes do their work.
- Will you excuse me?
- Where are you going?
- I just need to freshen up.
- You're fresh.
You're very fresh.
You seem very fresh to me.
You're very vital.
I couldn't take you any fresher.
George, I need to freshen.
George?
George?
George!
It was unbelievable.
You were right.
The jokes kept bouncing off her like Superman.
- See?
What did I tell you?
- Even when she did like something she doesn't laugh.
She says, "That's funny.
" "That's funny.
" I gotta call that woman at Doubleday.
See when I can pick up Mr. Pitt's racket.
How could I be with someone that doesn't laugh?
It's like Well, it's like something.
Hello.
Yeah, hi.
Is Miss Landis there, please?
What?
Gosh.
Okay.
She'll be in later?
Okay.
Thank you.
This guy said she hurt her arm playing tennis.
It's pretty bad.
Well, I heard a noise.
- What noise?
- You know: What..
?
From the bathroom.
- You think she was refunding?
- Every time we go out to eat the minute we're done, she's running for the bathroom.
- So you're concerned?
- Elaine, of course I'm concerned.
I'm paying for those meals.
It's like throwing money down the toilet.
- In a manner of speaking.
- Right.
Let me digest it.
Let me get my money's worth.
What would be good is if there was someone else in the bathroom that could tell me.
- Hey, here's your scrubber back, pal.
- Oh, thanks.
Hey, maybe I could bribe one of those women that hand out the towels in the powder room.
- A matron?
- Yeah.
Well, I can't help you there.
- What?
- Nothing.
- You know a matron?
- Me?
- You.
- No.
- Kramer.
- Look.
Just leave me alone.
- Well, what is it?
- Don't make me!
- What?
- No, I can't, all right?
I can't.
- Who?
- My mother's a matron!
- Babs?
- Yeah, there.
All right?
I said it.
You satisfied?
Anything else you wanna know?
Kramer, Kramer, I need to know if Nina is refunding.
- Look, George, I can't help you.
- Well, why not?
Why not?
Let go.
Because I haven't talked to my mother in five years.
We just don't see eye to eye.
I don't even wanna get into my childhood.
I'm still carrying a lot of pain.
A lot of pain.
- Come on, you could really help me.
- I can't.
Kramer, you're gonna have to face her sometime.
Hello?
Oh, my goodness.
What happened?
I tore my humeral epicondylitis.
The doctor said it may never fully heal.
I may never play again.
- You'll be playing - If I can't play tennis I don't know what I'll do.
There are plenty of things you can do.
There's chess and mahjong.
You don't know how lucky you are to be healthy.
- And biking and - What am I going to do?
Could I..
?
If I can't play tennis, I have no reason to live.
You know, it's not important.
I'm gonna Okay.
Well, you know, take care of that condylitis.
Ma?
Cosmo.
Cosmo?
- Why didn't you just ask her for it?
- I told you, I couldn't.
The woman was crying about how she might never play tennis again.
- Yeah.
- Hidee-ho.
Come on up.
Well, when do you have to get the racket back to Mr. Pitt?
He's got a big match tomorrow with Ethel Kennedy.
He needs a $300 Bruline to beat Ethel Kennedy?
He'll only play with his racket.
Why don't you wait till she's not there on her lunch hour and just take it?
- That's stealing.
Stealing?
You loaned her the racket.
I know.
Hey.
So, what happened with Kramer's mother?
It's all worked out.
Nina and I are gonna have dinner Thursday at the restaurant where Babs works.
- What's she like?
- Oh, she's a Kramer.
And while I was there, I happened to pick up another juicy little nugget about our friend.
- I'm ready.
What?
- Come on.
What is it?
- I got the first name.
- What?
You found out Kramer's first name?
- That's right.
You ready?
- Yes, we're ready.
I've been trying to get it out of him for 10 years.
What is it?
Cosmo.
- Cosmo?
- Cosmo?
- Cosmo.
- Cosmo?
Cosmo!
What's so funny?
What?
Cosmo?
All right, all right.
Okay.
So you know the name now.
The cat is out of the bag.
I gotta hand it to you.
You did a hell of a job keeping it a secret all these years.
It's not such a bad name.
You know, all my life I've been running away from that name.
That's why I wouldn't tell anybody.
But I been thinking about it.
All this time I'm trying not to be me.
I'm afraid to face who I was.
But I'm Cosmo, Jerry.
I'm Cosmo Kramer, and that's who I'm gonna be.
From now on, I'm Cosmo.
- Yes?
- Hi, is Sandi here?
Oh, hi.
You must be Jerry.
Sandi's in the shower.
You wanna come in?
Well, I would except I forgot to bring a towel.
So the roommate laughed at everything I said.
It was a great-sounding laugh too.
Kind of lilting and feminine.
None of those big, coarse "ha's.
" - You know those?
- Oh, yeah.
Hate the big, coarse "ha.
" I hate those.
And the worst part is that she also possessed many of the other qualities prized by the superficial man.
I see.
So as you can see, I've got a bit of a problem here.
Well, if I hear you correctly, and I think that I do my advice to you is to finish your meal pay your check, leave here and never mention this to anyone again.
Can't be done, huh?
- The switch?
- The switch.
Can't be done.
I wonder.
Do you realize in the entire history of Western civilization no one successfully accomplished the roommate switch.
In the Middle Ages you could get locked up for even suggesting it.
They didn't have roommates in the Middle Ages.
- How do you know?
- For one thing they didn't have apartments.
I'm sure at some point between the years 800 and 1200 somewhere there were two women living together.
The point is, I intend to undertake this.
And I'll do it with or without you.
So if you're scared if you haven't got the stomach for this, let's get it out right now.
And I'll go on my own.
If not, you can get onboard, and we can get to work.
Now, what's it gonna be?
All right, damn it, I'm in.
I couldn't do it without you.
All right.
Let's get to work.
All right.
That's enough for today.
You're tired.
Get some sleep.
- I'll see you first thing in the morning.
- We can't do it.
Who are we kidding?
It's impossible.
It's true.
You can't do the switch.
Nobody can do the switch.
It was a stupid idea to begin with.
Let's face it.
I'm stuck with the non-laugher, and that's that.
- We'll come up with something.
- Yeah.
Sure we will.
See you tomorrow.
I got it!
All right.
Let's go over it again one more time.
All right.
So I tell Sandi that I wanna have a ménage à trois with her and her roommate.
- That's right.
And you believe this course of action will have a two-pronged effect.
Firstly, the very mention of the idea will cause Sandi to recoil in disgust.
Whereupon, she will insist that I remove myself from the premises.
- Keep going.
- At this point, it is inevitable that she will seek out the roommate to apprise her of this abhorrent turn of events.
- Continue.
- The roommate will then offer her friend the requisite sympathy even as part of her cannot help but feel somewhat flattered by her inclusion in the unusual request.
A few days go by and a call is placed at a time when Sandi is known to be busy at work.
Once the initial awkwardness is relieved with a little playful humor which she, of course, cannot resist an invitation to a friendly dinner is proffered.
Well, it all sounds pretty good.
There's only one flaw in it.
They're roommates.
She'd have to go out with me behind Sandi's back.
She's not gonna do that.
You disappoint me, my friend.
Sandi wants nothing to do with you.
She tells Laura, "If you wanna waste your time with that pervert that's your problem.
" It's the perfect plan.
So inspired, so devious, yet so simple.
This is what I do.
Can I help you?
- No.
I'm okay.
- Then what are you doing with that racket?
- It's mine.
- Ms. Landis borrowed it.
- I'm sorry.
You can't take that.
- No, no, no.
- No, no.
I can.
I can.
- It's mine.
It's my racket.
- Look, I don't know who you are I don't know what you're doing - Okay.
I'm going.
I'm going.
- Not with that racket.
- Give that to me.
You give it.
Give it to me.
All right, all right.
Forget it.
But you don't have to mention any of this to Miss Landis, do you?
- I don't have to, but I will.
- Hi, Cosmo.
- Hi, Mr. Clotworthy.
- How are you today?
- Couldn't be better.
- Hi, Lorraine.
- Hi, Cosmo.
- My mom, Babs.
- Hi, Mrs. Kramer.
- Lorraine.
- Yes, it's a fine day.
- What do you say, Cosmo?
- Hey, everything, my man.
- What?
- I don't know the exact pronunciation but I believe it's "ménage à trois.
" That is a wild idea.
You know, Ma, I been thinking.
I want you to quit that matron job.
Yes, well, isn't that just easy for you to say.
What the hell do you think I'm gonna do?
Well, maybe we could go into business together, if you're clean.
I told you I've been clean for two years.
- Anyway, what would we do together.
- I got plenty of ideas.
I always believed in you, Cosmo.
You know that.
So I want you to call that place today and tell them that you're through.
- All right, I'll do it.
- Yeah.
- So good.
- So glad.
Excuse me, I've gotta freshen up.
And why shouldn't you?
Be fresh.
Stay fresh.
I'll be back.
I'm really not feeling very well.
- Care to see our dessert menu?
- Yeah.
Do you know Babs?
Oh, yeah.
I was sorry to hear she left.
- Babs left?
- Yeah.
She quit today.
What are you doing in here, George?
I was just wondering what it was you wanted for dessert?
How you feeling?
- Hi, Newman.
- Hi, Babs.
What are you doing?
- Minding my own business.
- You can't get into trouble that way.
What makes you think I'm looking for trouble?
From what I hear, you postmen don't have to look too far.
Well, you know, sometimes it just has a way of finding you.
Cigarette?
Don't mind if I do.
Kramer.
Kramer!
- Hey.
- What happened to Babs?
She never showed up last night.
The whole thing blew up in my face.
That's a shame.
Hey, what happened with Sandi?
I forgot all about it.
Did you call her?
Yeah, I did.
In fact, I went over there.
So, what happened?
Did she throw you out?
No, actually, she took it pretty well.
- So, what happened?
- She's into it.
- Into what?
- The ménage.
And not only that, she just called me.
She told me she spoke with the roommate and the roommate's into the ménage too.
That's unbelievable.
Oh, it's a scene, man.
Do you ever just get down on your knees and thank God that you know me and have access to my dementia?
What are you talking about?
I'm not gonna do it.
You're not gonna do it?
What do you mean?
I can't.
I'm not an orgy guy.
Are you crazy?
This is like discovering plutonium by accident.
Don't you know what it means to become an orgy guy?
It changes everything.
I'd have to dress and act different.
I'd have to grow a mustache and get all kinds of robes and lotions and get a new bedspread, new curtains.
I'd have to get thick carpeting and weirdo lighting.
Then I'd have to get new friends.
I'd have to get orgy friends.
No, I'm not ready for it.
If only something like that could happen to me.
Shut up.
You couldn't do it either.
I know.
- Did you get your racket?
- No.
I got caught.
- What do you mean, you got caught?
- Her assistant caught me.
I'm probably not gonna get a job.
He's gonna tell Landis that I was sneaking around her office.
I still don't understand how you can get in trouble for taking your own racket.
Meanwhile, Mr. Pitt's got this match with Ethel Kennedy this afternoon.
- Hey.
- Hey, Cosmo.
- Hi, Cosmo.
- Thanks, buddy.
Hey, doesn't Newman have a Bruline racket?
Yeah, yeah.
But he's on vacation.
Went to Baltimore.
But you got the key to his place, right?
- Yeah.
- Elaine needs to borrow his racket.
- Just for today.
- All right.
Come on.
I'll take you over to Newman's.
Hey, Cosmo!
What happened to your mother last night?
- She hung me out to dry.
- She quit.
It would have been nice if somebody told me about it.
I just think she could've said something, that's all.
- Don't talk to me, George.
Talk to her.
- Where is she?
I don't know.
Ma!
- Cosmo.
- I'm sorry.
We weren't We didn't Cosmo?
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
The Christmas tree seems to inspire a love-hate relationship.
All that time is spent selecting it and decorating it and then a week after, it's just thrown somewhere.
You see it by the side of the road.
It looks like a mob hit.
The car slows down, the door opens, and this tree just rolls out.
People snap out of that Christmas spirit like it was a drunken stupor.
They just wake up one morning and go: "Oh, my God, there's a tree inside the house.
Just throw it anywhere.
" Ready to go, Lois?
Boy, you sure like to say my name, don't you?
Excuse me, Lois.
Stand back, Lois.
Jimmy's in trouble, Lois.
Oh, Mr. Meyer, this is my friend Jerry - Jerry Seinfeld.
- Duncan Meyer.
- You two know each other?
- Yeah.
We went to high school together, didn't we, Jerry?
- Yeah, yeah.
- Gee, I hope you're not leaving now.
We still have a lot of work left to do.
Would you be able to come all the way downtown again in rush hour and pick me up?
Why, I'd have to be Superman to do that, Lois.
No.
No, this is all wrong.
- Where's the chicken cashew?
- You no order chicken cashew.
No, I didn't order any of this.
I'm not paying for this.
Fine, Benes.
We're putting you on our list.
- What list?
- The do-not-deliver list.
Merry Christmas to you.
- Well, I guess we'll just go out.
- Yeah.
What are you doing with the Daily Worker?
I figure Ned must have left it here.
Your boyfriend reads the Daily Worker?
What is he, a Communist?
He reads everything.
You know, Ned's very well-read.
Maybe he's just very, well, Red.
A Communist?
Don't you think he probably would have told me?
Well, does he wear bland, drab, olive-colored clothing?
Yes.
Yes, he does dress a little drab.
He's a Communist.
Hey, look at this.
"Exciting, uninhibited woman seeks forward-thinking comrade.
Appearance not important.
" Appearance not important?
This is unbelievable.
Finally, this an ideology I can embrace.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Where's Lois?
- She couldn't make it.
I can't believe you're going out with a woman named Lois.
I know.
Finally.
But, George, guess who her boss is?
- Duncan Meyer.
- Duncan Meyer?
- Who's he?
- Elaine only one person knows what I'm about to tell you and that's George.
In the ninth grade they had us all line up in the schoolyard for this race to see who would represent the school in this track meet.
I was the last one on the end, George was next to me and Mr. Bevilaqua - What's that?
- Mr. Bevilaqua, the gym teacher.
- Oh, of course.
- He was down at the other end.
So he yells out, "Ready.
On your mark.
Get set " And I was so keyed up, I just took off.
By the time he said, "Go," I was ten yards ahead.
- No.
- I looked up.
I couldn't believe it.
By the time the race was over, I had won.
I was shocked.
- Nobody had noticed the head start.
- Really?
Yes.
And I had won by so much a myth began to grow about my speed.
Only Duncan suspected something was amiss.
He's hated me ever since.
And now he's back.
Well, what happened when you raced him again?
I never did.
In four years of high school, I would never race anyone not even to the end of a block or to catch a bus.
And so the legend grew.
Everyone wanted me to race.
They begged me.
The track coach called my parents, pleading, telling them it was a sin for me to waste my God-given talent.
But I answered him in the same way I answered everyone.
I choose not to run.
So now Duncan is back?
He's back.
As I knew he would be someday.
Man, that's some tart cider.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Sorry I missed the Chinese food.
- Oh, so am I. How's Duncan?
He's okay.
He say anything?
About what?
Oh, nothing in particular.
- Why did you cheat in that race?
- I did not cheat.
He said that you got a head start.
Oh, he's just jealous because he came in second.
- Really?
- Yeah.
So you were the fastest kid in school.
Faster than a speeding bullet, Lois.
So how was work?
Another day, another dollar?
- I guess.
- Yeah, well, nothing wrong with that.
Gotta make those big bucks.
Money, money, money.
Are you a Communist?
Yes, as a matter of fact, I am.
A commie.
Must be a bummer for you guys what with the fall of the Soviet empire and everything.
Well, yeah.
Well, we still got China, Cuba.
Yeah, but come on.
- I know.
It's not the same.
- Well, you had a good run.
I mean, what was it?
Seventy-five, making everybody nervous.
Yeah, we had a good run.
Well, so enjoy yourself.
So you lied to her?
I couldn't tell her the truth.
I don't know what's gonna happen between us.
If we have a bad breakup, she'll go to Duncan.
I want him to go to his grave never being certain that I got that head start.
Well, I'm dating a Communist.
- A Communist?
That's something.
- Yeah, that's pretty cool, isn't it?
Hey, I called one of those girls from the personal ads in the Daily Worker.
- The Daily Worker has personals?
- Yeah.
And they say that appearance is not important.
Yours or hers?
Merry Christmas, everyone.
- Merry Christmas.
- Well, look at you.
- You got the job.
- You're looking at the new Santa at Coleman's Department Store.
- All right.
Way to go.
- Congratulations.
Yeah.
Feel that, isn't it great?
Look, it's Mickey.
Come on.
Get your beard on.
We're gonna be late.
On Prancer.
On Dasher.
On Donna.
It's not Donna.
It's Donner.
- It's Donna.
- Right.
On Prancer.
On Dancer.
On Ethel.
On Harriet.
Hello.
Oh, hi, Lois.
He wants to get together?
What for?
I don't know about that.
I'll have to think about it.
- I'll let you know.
Okay.
Bye.
- What's up?
Duncan wants to get together with me and her.
He's gonna try to get me to admit I got a head start.
I don't think she believes me.
He wants to meet you?
I'll tell you what.
I'll show up.
He doesn't know we're friends.
I'll pretend I haven't seen you since school.
I'll back up the story.
- That's not bad.
- Not bad?
It's gorgeous.
Well, come on, little princess, tell Santa what you want.
- Don't be shy.
- She doesn't speak English.
Oh, Santa speaks the language of all children.
Hey, Mickey, when do we get a break?
My lap is killing me.
- There is no break.
- This is like a sweatshop.
- Kramer.
- Hey, hey, hey.
There's a Natalie on line two.
- Natalie?
- From the Daily Worker.
Thank you.
Hello.
Yes, Natalie.
Well, yes, this is a business office, but I'm not a businessman per se.
I'm here working for the people.
Yes, I'm causing dissent stirring the pot, getting people to question the whole rotten system.
- Elaine.
- Arlene.
- Hi.
- Hello.
- Doing a little Christmas shopping?
- Yeah, yeah.
Oh, this is Ned.
He's a Communist.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.
Big Communist.
Big, big Communist.
- It was awfully nice to see you.
- Yeah, see you later.
- Okey-dokey.
Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.
Listen, as long as we're here what do you say we do a little shirt-shopping?
Out of the question.
- Kramer.
- Oh, hi.
Hi.
Hi, Mickey.
How are you?
- This is Ned.
- Oh, hey.
How are you doing there, buddy?
Hey, you guys stay here, okay?
I'll be right back.
Right back.
Eight hours of jingle-belling and ho-ho-hoing.
Boy, I am hoed out.
- Anyone who works here is a sap.
- Hey, watch it, pal.
Whoa, whoa, easy.
Come on, come on.
What's the matter with you?
The Santas at Bloomfields are making double what you are.
- Double?
- I bet the glue from that beard itches.
You've got that straight.
So when you get a rash all over your face you think Coleman's will be there with a medical plan?
Look, you take that commie crap out to the street.
I've got literature in my car that will change your whole way of thinking.
- Talk to me.
- Don't listen to him.
You've got a good job here.
There's just no way you could've beaten me by that much.
I had already beaten you in junior high school three times.
I didn't hit puberty till the ninth grade.
That's what gave me my speed.
Besides, if I got a head start, why didn't Mr. Bevilaqua stop the race?
- That's what I've always wondered.
- Well Oh, my God.
No.
Oh, my God.
Jerry.
I'm sorry.
George.
- George Costanza.
- Oh, George Costanza.
- Kennedy High.
- Yes, yes, yes.
- This is unbelievable.
- Hi, George.
Oh, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Don't tell me.
Don't tell me.
It starts with a Duncan.
That's right.
Wow, this is something.
I haven't seen you guys in, what, 20 years?
- This is Lois.
- Hi, there.
What have you been doing with yourself?
Well, I'm a comedian.
Well, I really wouldn't know about that.
I don't watch much TV.
I like to read.
What do you do?
A lot of that did-you-ever-notice stuff?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It strikes me a lot of guys are doing that kind.
Yeah, yeah.
Well, you really went bald there, didn't you?
- Yeah, yeah.
- You used to really have a thick, full head of hair.
- Yeah, yeah.
Poof.
Yeah, well, I guess I started losing it when I was about 28 right around the time I made my first million.
Yeah.
You know, it's true what they say.
- The first million is the hardest one.
- Yeah, yeah.
- What do you do?
- I'm an architect.
Have you designed any buildings in New York?
Have you seen the new addition to the Guggenheim?
- You did that?
- Yep, yep.
Really didn't take very long either.
Well, you've really built yourself up into something.
I had a dream, Jerry.
You know, one can't help but wonder what brings you into a crummy little coffee shop like this.
Well, I like to stay in touch with the people.
You got a hole in your sneaker there.
What is that, canvas?
Yeah, my driver is waiting so I really should get running.
Good to see you guys again.
George, George, hang on a second because we haven't seen you in so long.
I thought we might reminisce.
Duncan and I were just talking about the day of the big race.
Oh, the big race.
Yes, yes.
- You were there?
- Oh, sure, sure.
I certainly was.
Yeah, I remember that day.
Well, I'll never forget it because that was the day that I lost my virginity to Miss Stafford the voluptuous homeroom teacher.
- Miss Stafford?
Yes, yes.
You know, I was in detention and she came up behind me while I was erasing the board.
- George.
- But I digress.
Let me see.
I remember you were standing at one end of the line.
I was right next to you and I remember we were even for the first five yards and then You were gone.
- Did I get a head start?
- Head start?
Oh, no.
Absolutely not.
No.
You satisfied?
So you see?
No.
I'm still not convinced, and I never will be.
Why don't the two of you just race again?
- That's a good idea.
- No, no, no.
Another race.
Out of the question.
You've been saying that for 20 years.
You know you can't beat me.
You couldn't beat me then, and you can't beat me now.
Race him, Jerry.
Race him.
All right.
I'll do it.
The race is on.
- You're gonna race him?
- Yeah.
And he's calling all these people from high school to come and watch.
I knew this day would come.
I can't.
I can't go through with it.
I'm calling it off.
I can't let the legend die.
It's like a kid finding out there's no Santa Claus.
Each according to his ability, to each according to his means.
What does that mean?
Well, if you got means and ability, that's a pretty good combination.
So what if I wanna open a delicatessen?
There are no delicatessens under Communists.
Whoa, why not?
Well, because the meats are divided into a class system.
You've got pastrami and corned beef in one and salami and bologna in another.
Not right.
So you can't get corned beef?
Well, you know, if you're in the politburo, maybe.
Yeah, this is George Costanza.
Any messages for me?
Why does Mr. Steinbrenner wanna see me in his office?
Communist?
I'm not a Communist.
All right.
All right.
I'll be there.
My secretary told Mr. Steinbrenner I'm a Communist.
Now he wants to see me.
You'll just explain to him that you're not a Communist.
You just called the woman for a date.
Hello.
Oh, hi, Duncan.
No.
Four o'clock tomorrow that is not going to work.
Why?
I'll tell you why.
Because I choose not to run.
I'm sorry, Elaine.
This shirt's too fancy.
Just because you're a Communist, you can't wear anything nice?
- You look like Trotsky.
- Good.
Fine.
You wanna be a Communist?
Be a Communist.
Can't you at least look like a successful Communist?
All right.
I'll try it on.
- I'm gonna order Chinese food.
- You're ordering from Hop Sing's?
Does it have to be Hop Sing's?
I kind of had a fight with them.
Elaine, when my father was blacklisted he couldn't work for years.
He and his friends used to sit in Hop Sing's every day figuring out how to survive.
- Your father was blacklisted?
- Yes, he was.
And you know why?
Because he was betrayed by people he trusted.
- They named names.
- Okay.
Okay.
Yeah, hi.
I'd like a delivery, please to 16 West 75th Street.
Apartment 2G.
I know that address.
You're Benes, right?
You're on our list.
No more deliveries!
No, no.
She doesn't live here anymore.
This is someone else.
Oh, yeah?
What's the name?
Why do you need a name?
You already have the address.
We need a name.
Give us a name.
Okay, okay.
Ned Isaacoff.
I want a racing car set.
A racing car set?
Listen.
You don't want that.
Those are assembled in Taiwan by kids like you.
And these Coleman pigs, they sell it for triple the cost.
- But I want a racing car set.
- No.
Don't you see, kid?
You're being bamboozled.
These capitalist fat cats are inflating the profit margin and reducing your total number of toys.
- Hey, this guy is a commie!
- Hey, kid, quiet.
Where did a nice little boy like you learn such a bad word like that?
Commie, commie, traitor to our country.
Santa is not a commie.
He just forgot how his good friend stuck his neck out for him to get him a good job like this, didn't he, Santa?
Is there a problem here?
This guy's a commie, and he's spreading propaganda.
Oh, yeah?
Well, that's enough, pinko.
You're through.
The both of you.
- I got two kids in college.
- Oh, you can't fire me.
I'm Santa.
Not anymore.
Get your skinny ass out of here!
Hi, how are you?
Fine.
What's the matter?
I just spoke to Duncan.
He said if you don't race, he's going to fire me.
What?
He can't do that.
Yes, he can.
He controls the means of production.
What are you gonna do, Jerry?
Don't worry, Lois.
I'll think of something.
I knew it was you.
You tried to trick Hop Sing.
You're on our list.
Elaine Benes.
And now you're on our list.
Ned Isaacoff.
You got me blacklisted at Hop Sing's?
She named name.
You wanted to see me, Mr. Steinbrenner?
Yes, George, I did.
Come in, come in.
George, the word around the office is that you're a Communist.
A Communist?
I am a Yankee, sir, first and foremost.
A Communist pipeline into the vast reservoir of Cuban baseball talent could be the greatest thing ever to happen to this organization.
- Sir?
- You could be invaluable to this franchise.
There's a southpaw nobody's been able to get a look at.
Something-Rodriguez.
I don't really know his name.
Get yourself to Havana right away.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
- Do my best.
- Good.
Merry Christmas, George.
Bring me back some cigars in the cedar boxes.
The ones with the fancy rings.
Love those rings.
They distract you while you're smoking.
The red and yellow are nice.
Looks good against the brown of the cigar.
I like the maduro wrapper.
The darker, the better.
That's what I say.
The claro's good too.
That's more of a pale brown.
Almost like a milky coffee.
I find the ring size very confusing.
They have it in centimeters, which I don't understand.
- That was great.
Nice job, Santa.
- Yeah.
I knew that stuff was gonna get us in trouble.
Well, I didn't realize it was such a sensitive issue.
Communism.
You didn't realize Communism was a sensitive issue?
What do you think's been going on in the world for the past 50 years?
- Wake up and smell the coffee.
- I guess I screwed up!
Oh, you sure did.
Big time.
How do you feel?
I need a miracle.
Now you're gonna see what kind of a liar you're mixed up with.
Well, if he beats you, I want a big raise.
If he beats me, I'll not only give you a raise I'll send you to Hawaii for two weeks.
I parked in front.
As soon as this race is over, we gotta go to the airport.
Yeah.
I'll be there.
You ready, boys?
- Yeah, Mr. Bevilaqua.
- This is the way it's gonna work.
You take your marks.
I say, "Ready, on your mark, get set" and then fire.
You got it?
- Yes, Mr. Bevilaqua.
- Yes, Mr. Bevilaqua.
- Come on, Jerry.
- Come on, Jerry.
Ready.
On your mark.
Jerry.
So will you come to Hawaii with me, Jerry?
Maybe I will, Lois.
Maybe I will.
You wanted to see me, el presidente?
Come here.
I understand you are very interested in one of our players.
Ordinarily, I would not grant such a request.
But I have heard you are, how you say, communista simpatico.
Well, good.
Then you can have your pick.
They will play for your Yankees.
And I would be honored if you would be my guest for dinner tonight at the Presidential Palace.
There will be girls there.
And I hear some pretty good food.
Of course, the problem with parties is you invariably have to eat standing up, which I don't care for.
But on the other hand, I don't like to balance a plate on my lap either.
Once when I was at a party, I put my plate on someone's piano.
If I had not been a dictator I would not have been able to get away with that one.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Loyalty to any one sports team is pretty hard to justify because the players are always changing.
The team can move.
You're actually rooting for the clothes when you get right down to it.
I mean, you are standing and cheering and yelling for your clothes to beat the clothes from another city.
Fans will be so in love with a player but if he goes to another team, they boo him.
This is the same human being in a different shirt.
They hate him now.
Boo.
Different shirt.
Boo.
Sure you don't want the tickets?
- No.
- I can't believe I'm having trouble getting rid of Super Bowl tickets.
- I'm telling you, skip the wedding.
- Go to the game.
- I can't.
The Drake put me in the wedding party.
Well, who schedules his wedding on Super Bowl Sunday?
- Maybe he didn't know.
- Let me see.
I can't believe you got these for free.
What?
Row F?
Row F. In front of the G's.
Hobnobbing with the D's and E's.
- How about Kramer or Elaine?
- Elaine laughed at me.
Kramer's interested in Canadian football.
Well, wish I could help you.
Come on, take them.
You could take Bonnie.
You paying my hotel and airfare to Miami?
- What do you think?
- In order to use these I gotta spend, like, 1500 bucks.
This is a bill for $1500.
Plus, she'd ask about the sleeping arrangements.
I find sleeping-arrangement conversations depressing.
Yeah.
Sleeping arrangements.
- So you haven't..
?
- Oh, no, no, no.
I haven't even seen her apartment yet.
Tomorrow night's the first night.
Hey, hey.
Is that Tim Whatley?
- The dentist?
- Is he mad at you for crashing his Thanksgiving party?
- No.
I explained it to him.
- He was fine with it.
- Oh, good.
Yeah.
I blamed it on you.
- Hi, Tim.
- Hey, Jerry.
George.
What are you up to?
Oh, just a couple gals out on the town, shopping and gabbing.
I'm getting a makeover.
Hey, how'd you like to go to the Super Bowl?
- What, are you kidding?
- Here.
Two tickets.
Have a good time.
How can I thank you?
I'll take you to dinner sometime.
- You ever been to Mendy's?
- No.
No, no.
No dinner.
Tim, you didn't have to get me a thank-you gift.
I know.
It's a label maker.
The Label Baby Junior.
Yeah, I hear they're good.
Well, label me thankful.
Okay.
Well, you enjoy those tickets.
Bye-bye.
Yeah?
Come in.
Hey, where can I put this?
- What is it?
- It's Risk, Jerry.
The game of world conquest.
- All right, that's perfect.
- Kramer, why do you have to..
?
Hello, Newman.
Hello, Jerry.
Will he take it?
I gotta go to work.
- Take what?
- The board, Jerry.
We've been playing at Newman's for six hours, but he's gotta go.
- Why not leave it at Newman's?
- I wanted to.
He won't let me.
We have to put the board in a neutral place where no one will tamper with it.
- So that's here?
- Yes, yes.
You're like Switzerland.
I don't wanna be Switzerland.
Jerry, Newman and I are engaged in an epic struggle for world domination.
It's winner take all.
People cannot be trusted.
- Don't look at me.
- I'm looking right at you, big daddy.
- All right, soldier boys.
Let's fall out.
- Yeah.
- All right, you're gonna look after it?
- Yeah, yeah.
- Stay strong.
Watch it good.
- Yeah.
Okay.
- Hey, hey.
- Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
- Oh, is that a label maker?
- Yes, it is.
I got it as a gift.
It's a Label Baby Junior.
Love the Label Baby, baby.
You know, those things make great gifts.
I just got one for Tim Whatley for Christmas.
- Tim Whatley?
- Yeah.
Who sent you that one?
One Tim Whatley.
No.
My Tim Whatley?
The same.
He sent it as a thank you for my Super Bowl tickets.
I think this is the same one I gave him.
He recycled this gift.
He's a re-gifter.
Or maybe he liked your gift so much, he decided to get me the same thing.
Perhaps it's an homage.
Yeah, perhaps.
Well, how did he react when you gave it to him?
He said, "Oh, a label maker.
How about that.
" - He repeated the name of the gift?
- Yeah.
So?
Well, if you repeat the name of the gift, you can't possibly like it.
What do you mean?
Like when someone opens something and goes: "Oh, tube socks.
" - What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.
I guess I'll just get invited up to his apartment and see if he's got a label maker.
- Why did you get him a gift?
He did some dental work for me and didn't charge.
So I got him a Christmas present.
Yeah, well, if you're getting him anything for his birthday, I'm a large.
Well, here we are.
This is the place.
You like it?
I love it.
This is fantastic.
Look at this couch.
Is this velvet?
Are you a velvet fan?
A fan?
I would drape myself in velvet if it were socially acceptable.
Look at this.
Hardwood floors.
Aren't they great?
Oh, Scott, hi.
This is George.
- Nice to meet you.
- This is Scott, my roommate.
- Hey.
- Here.
Check out this view.
If you lean out this window, you can see the river.
So Scott's your roommate, huh?
Yes.
I'm sure I've mentioned him.
No, I don't think you mentioned him, no.
He's a great guy.
You'll really like him.
I'm sure I will.
- Male roommate.
- Yes, a male roommate.
- And this is a problem?
- It's a huge problem, Jerry.
The hardest part about having sex with a woman is getting her to come back to your place.
He's already got that.
- Well, maybe he's - No, believe me, he's not.
- So he's an eligible receiver.
- Right.
She's confiding in him about our dates.
You always like the person you talk to about the date more than the date.
It's just a matter of time until they realize, "Hey, we could have sex.
" - What's stopping them?
- Exactly.
You know how they get animals to reproduce?
They just put them in the same cage.
- What does he look like?
- That's the worst part.
He looks just like me.
He looks like you, and he's working from the inside?
I look like me, and I'm working from the outside.
- Who is in the better position?
- Not you.
This bizarre Harrad Experiment must end.
We'll take our check, please.
I gotta find a way to work this out.
I love that apartment.
It's so cozy.
I'm ensconced in velvet.
- If it was socially acceptable - I know.
You would drape yourself in velvet.
- I've said that before?
- Many times.
You love velvet.
You wanna live in velvet.
Everything with the velvet.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Guess what.
- I saw Newman talking to the super.
- So what?
The super has keys to your apartment.
Don't you see what's going on?
Newman is planning a sneak attack.
Oh, maybe he's got no hot water.
Yeah.
All right, fine.
You sit there and you watch while Newman takes over the world, but he'd be a horrible leader.
And you know who's gonna suffer?
The little people.
You and George.
- Are you through?
- All right.
Fine.
I talked to Arthur Jobania.
- The Drake's wedding.
That's off.
- The wedding is off?
- What happened?
- The Drake he found out that the wedding is on the same day as the Super Bowl.
So he wanted to postpone it.
They got in a big argument and it's over.
The wedding is off.
You can go to the Super Bowl.
I can't call Tim and ask for the tickets back.
You just gave them to him two days ago.
He's gotta give you a grace period.
Are you even vaguely familiar with the concept of giving?
There's no grace period.
Well, didn't he re-gift the label maker?
- Possibly.
- Well, if he can re-gift why can't you de-gift?
- You may have a point.
- I have a point.
I have a point.
- All right, I'll call him.
- Yeah.
- What's that?
- Oh, it's Risk.
It's a game of world domination being played by two guys who can barely run their own lives.
Hello, Tim?
Yeah, hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld.
Hey, remember those tickets I gave you?
Well, it turns out I can use them.
Oh, you do?
I understand.
Okay.
Bye.
He already made plans.
He can't change them.
Well, they're his tickets.
- He can do what he wants with them.
- Thanks.
- I'm heading over to Bonnie's.
- What about the roommate?
I gotta try and figure out a way to switch places with him.
It's like a Siegfried & Roy trick.
The pickle breath is a good start.
Hello, Jerry.
May I come in?
What do you want?
Nothing.
Just being neighborly.
You wanna hang out?
Shoot the breeze?
I won't let you cheat.
You're not getting near that board.
Jerry, I'm a little insulted.
You're not a little anything, Newman.
So just pack it up and move it out of here.
All right.
Oh, by the way, what are you doing for the Super Bowl?
I don't know.
Watch it on TV, I guess.
Why?
If you watch closely, you just might see me.
I'll be the one waving to the camera from my seat on the 40-yard line.
- You're going to the Super Bowl?
- Yes.
A guy on my mail route got a couple tickets and offered me one.
- What's his name?
- Tim Whatley.
That's my ticket.
Is it?
Well, if only you'd known you could have saved some time and given it directly to me.
Newman.
What a movie.
Good choice.
- Thank Scott.
He recommended it.
- Oh, Scott, Scott.
He's really great, isn't he?
- Yes, he is.
- Yes, he is.
Let me ask you something.
When you come out of the shower and put your robe on do you cinch it tight?
Are you concerned about that?
George.
Do you hold the neck together or are you just letting it flap in the breeze?
George, you're being ridiculous.
What's the massage situation?
- What do you mean?
- Is there any work being done?
Is there any rubbing, touching, finger manipulation on the other person?
And if so, who is making the request?
George, would you just stop.
Say you go into the bathroom at 2:00 in the morning.
What's the outfit?
I mean, are you dressing up, or is it come as you are?
- George, what is wrong with you?
- I'll tell you what's wrong.
A grown woman with a male roommate.
It's unnatural.
It's an abomination.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- How you doing?
- I'm good.
Do you need the bathroom?
I'm gonna jump in the shower.
No.
Just throw my bras out of the way.
Well, this is my building.
Yes, it is.
- This was fun, you know?
- Yeah.
So I guess I'll talk to you.
Aren't you gonna invite me upstairs?
Upstairs?
You wanna go upstairs?
I would love to go upstairs.
Elaine, you are something else.
No one could ever put a label on you, huh?
We'll see.
Newman.
He's going with Newman.
How does Tim Whatley even know Newman?
Newman's his mailman.
Who goes to the Super Bowl with their mailman?
Who goes anywhere with Newman?
Well, he's merry.
He is merry.
I'll give him that.
What's this plant for?
Oh, I had a little tiff with Bonnie about the roommate.
Well, the cactus will smooth things over.
Hey.
Guess what.
I'm going to the Super Bowl with Tim Whatley.
- What?
- We went out for coffee and he offered me a ticket.
- But what about the label maker?
Well.
Wait a minute.
That's my ticket.
You didn't wanna go.
It was totally out of the blue.
We went upstairs to his apartment to look for the label maker How?
Did you say you had to use the bathroom?
- No.
- Then how did you get up there?
- I said, "Do you wanna go upstairs"?
- And there's your ticket.
- Well.
- What?
That's why you're going to the Super Bowl.
- Why?
- You go out with a guy one time.
You ask him to go upstairs like you're Mae West.
Of course he's gonna try and get you alone for the weekend.
You mean just because I asked him to go upstairs he thinks he's going downtown?
- Obviously.
- You're crazy.
- Well, what happened upstairs?
As soon as we walked in he got a call from one of his patients with an impacted molar so he had to leave.
I didn't look for the label maker.
I don't trust this guy.
I think he re-gifted and then de-gifted.
Now he's using an upstairs invite as a springboard to a Super Bowl sex romp.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- What are you doing?
- I'm watching your door.
- My door?
- Yeah.
From my peephole.
Fisheye.
Sees all.
- What was that?
- Newman.
Open it.
Open it.
Open.
Damn.
The bedroom.
Get him.
- I see you, Newman.
I see you.
- I'm taking the Congo as a penalty.
I've got a confession to make.
- What's that?
- I've got Super Bowl fever.
- Yeah.
Yeah, me too.
- Yeah.
- So where are we staying?
- Oh, the Ambassador.
Big room?
It's a regular room, but it's right downtown.
- Downtown?
- Right downtown.
What do they have there?
A couple of beds?
Why?
You bringing someone else?
No but don't you think there should be two beds?
There's two of us.
Oh, a cactus.
They don't need any water so you don't have to keep taking them to the bathroom.
Well look who's here.
I asked Scott to move out.
So she kicked him out of the apartment?
That's right.
It's just me and her.
She rearranged her whole life for you.
Yeah, I guess she did.
He's gone.
Now I'm the man.
That's not a good role for you.
No, it's not.
You unwittingly made a major commitment.
That's a lot of pressure.
Oh, my God.
You wanted to be ensconced in velvet.
You're buried.
I had the perfect situation here.
He was shouldering half the load.
- He was shouldering.
- I couldn't leave well enough alone.
Where you going?
I gotta go help tape up all his boxes and get them ready for shipping.
Well, here.
Take Whatley's label maker.
- I don't wanna see it again.
- Thanks.
Yeah.
I am taking over South America and there ain't nothing you can do about it.
Too bad about that Super Bowl ticket, huh, Newman?
Yeah.
I just hope Tim Whatley's electric bills don't suddenly get lost in the mail or it could be lights out for him.
Okay.
Thanks for having me over, guys.
Yeah.
- All right, I'll see you later.
- Oh, hey, Jerry.
Tim Whatley.
Out scalping?
See, now, I've been thinking a lot about what happened.
I feel horrible.
Listen, I wanna give you a ticket back.
- Are you serious?
What about Elaine?
- Oh, Elaine, yeah.
Well, things just didn't work out like I thought they would.
Hey, isn't this Kramer's car?
Hey, Cosmo!
They're towing your car.
What?
Not my car!
They're towing my car.
- What are you doing?
- I'm taking the board with me.
Hey.
Hey!
Hey, wait!
Wait!
Hey, wait a minute!
Hey!
- So I guess I'll see you at the game.
- Yeah, see you there.
Okay.
Good.
Hi, George.
Where..
?
What happened?
Where's..
?
Where's all the stuff?
It's gone.
It was all his.
Is this a label maker?
But the table, the stereo, the VCR The velvet couch.
Where's the velvet?
They were his.
Besides, we don't need any of those things.
We have each other.
Are you sure you know where the impound yard is?
Oh, stop stalling.
Come on.
I I can't think.
There's all this noise.
Or is it because I've built a stronghold around Greenland I've driven you out of Western Europe and I've left you teetering on the brink of complete annihilation?
I'm not beaten yet.
I still have armies in the Ukraine.
Yeah?
The Ukraine.
You know what the Ukraine is?
It's a sitting duck.
A road apple, Newman.
The Ukraine is weak.
It's feeble.
I think it's time to put the hurt on the Ukraine.
I come from Ukraine.
You not say Ukraine weak.
Yeah, we're playing a game here, pal.
Ukraine is game to you?
How about I take your little board and smash!
Hello, Tim.
- Elaine, hi.
- Don't worry, Tim.
I didn't come by to yell at you.
I didn't come by for that.
I just came by to pick up my label maker.
I gave you a label maker, and now I would like to have it back.
But you gave it to me.
But you gave me a ticket to the Super Bowl.
Hand it over, Whatley.
Okay.
You don't have the label maker, do you?
- No.
- I knew it.
- You're a re-gifter.
- Oh, yeah.
Some gift.
- That thing didn't work at all.
- What?
You put a label on something, It was the worst gift I ever got.
Well, I bought it for you because you were so nice to me for not charging me for the dental work.
The way you worked on my filling, you were so So gentle and so caring and so sensitive.
Oh, Elaine.
H G F. Seat four.
One, two, three Hello, Newman.
Hello, Jerry.
Tim couldn't make it.
He's in love.
- Isn't that wonderful?
- Oh, it's enchanting.
Here's the TV.
I know you wanted to watch the Super Bowl.
Do you at least have some towels we could sit on?
It's, like, a four-hour game.
George, Scott's gonna drop by.
He said he never got his boxes.
I'll get the towels.
How am I gonna get out of this?
Think, Costanza.
Think!
- Here we are.
- Hey.
Do you know, Bonnie, I I just had a pretty wild idea.
- What is it?
- Well, I I'm not sure how you pronounce it or anything, but I I believe it's ménage à trois?
What?
- Hi.
- Scott.
Remember what we talked about the other day?
George is into it.
Oh, really?
Great streak of luck I'm having.
First Kramer almost beats me at Risk, but I narrowly escape and then Tim Whatley gives me this Super Bowl ticket.
Can you move over at all?
And then Then, just as I'm about to go these boxes show up at the post office with no labels.
No labels, Jerry.
You know what that means?
Freebies!
I got this great mini TV and a VCR.
- It's unbelievable.
- An inch.
- Can you move over an inch?
- Oh, come on.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
The big new accessory with eyeglasses seems to be that strap that connects so you can take them on and off which I don't get because if you have glasses, isn't that because you need to wear glasses?
"You need glasses.
" Isn't that what they say?
An eye doctor doesn't say: "Would you care for some glasses"?
People with crutches don't have a chain attached to their belt so they can just let go of them every now and then.
Why not get a toupee with a rubber band for water-skiing?
The thing could just Hey, George.
Gary?
Where the hell have you been?
I've been leaving messages for months.
- I know, I've been busy.
- Don't give me busy.
Who's not busy?
I'm busy.
We're all busy.
Everybody's busy.
All right.
Tell me.
What's kept you so busy?
Mostly chemotherapy.
Hey, I'll see you.
Hey, pig!
Hey, hey, hey!
So you called the cop a pig?
I was yelling at the litterbug.
I mean, this is my town.
You don't throw trash on the streets of my town.
So, didn't you explain that to the cop?
No, I fled the scene.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Kramer, I need to talk to Jerry privately.
What about?
- Kramer.
- Oh, come on, George you can share it with me.
- You're hurting me.
- You gonna share with me next time?
- Sure.
I swear.
- All right.
I'm looking forward to it.
All right, I got news.
You ready?
- Gary Fogel had cancer.
- Oh, yeah, I knew.
- You knew?
How did you know?
- He told me a few months ago.
Why did he tell you and not me?
- I don't know.
- How are you closer to him than me?
- So is he okay?
- Oh, yeah, he's fine.
He was in bad shape for a while, though.
Really?
How bad?
Was he on his deathbed?
No, he was on his regular bed.
So why didn't you tell me?
- He swore me to secrecy.
- So?
It's not like you're my wife.
I still think you should've told me.
You were better off not knowing.
It's not easy to deal with someone in a situation like this.
I was so nice to him I almost made myself sick.
I'm gonna talk to him about this.
That's right.
You let him have it.
Who is he not to tell you about his life-threatening illness?
- That's what I'm saying.
- His illness is your business.
- If not mine, whose?
- If not now, when?
Were you just talking about me?
No, an old friend of ours, Gary.
Oh, the guy with cancer?
You told her?
She's not your wife.
If I told you, you would've given it away.
- You don't think I can keep a secret?
- No, but he would have read your face.
- You don't trust my poker face?
- Do you ever win at poker?
No.
Hey.
Oh, I just saw your old boyfriend on TV.
- Jake Jarmel?
- Yeah.
I like those glasses he was wearing.
Where'd he get those?
- Why?
You don't wear glasses.
- I know.
But I need a new look.
I'm stagnating.
I have to say, as a glasses-wearer, I take exception to that.
That's like me buying a wheelchair to cruise around in.
Yeah, I've considered that.
Look, how do I get in touch with this guy?
He's having a two-day book signing at Walden's.
You know, we had a really bad breakup.
The Jujyfruits?
Yeah, the Jujyfruits.
Okay, K-Man.
- Enjoy the book.
- Thank you.
Listen, Jake where did you get those eyeglass frames?
- I can't tell you.
- You don't know where?
Yes, I do, but I don't want anyone else to have them.
Well, that's peculiar.
Oh, there's that woman that never talks to anybody.
Really?
Every day she comes in and reads.
Never talks to anybody.
Oh, I spoke to Debby Biblow.
She said to say hi.
Really?
Gary, I really have to say I'm a little bit hurt that you didn't decide to confide in me.
Well, frankly, you can't keep a secret.
You know, you'd get two pair, the whole table knows.
Well, I still think it was wrong.
I'm sorry.
All right?
I guess I was just thinking of myself.
Yes.
So I called the litterbug a pig.
Not you.
I like policemen.
I wanted to be a policeman.
Yeah, so why didn't you?
I'm scared of being shot.
Mr. Kramer, let me tell you a story.
In 1979, I ticketed a brown Dodge Diplomat for parking in a church zone.
That fine was never paid.
And since then, that scofflaw has piled up more parking tickets than anyone in New York City.
For 16 years I pursued him only to see him give me the slip time and time again.
I've never got a clean look at his face but he's become my white whale.
Mr. Kramer, that day was yesterday.
But thanks to you, I don't know if I'll every get that chance again.
I like that eye patch.
All right.
I'm gonna move my car.
My meter's up.
- You can't park in this city.
- Hey.
George, you know that company I work for?
They own the parking lot around the corner.
- Oh, that's a Kinney lot?
- Yeah.
There's a space opening and I could get it for you.
You'd just pay tax.
It'd be, like, 50 a month.
Fifty bucks a month?
That's incredible.
Okay.
Thanks.
I got lunch, all right?
Still owe me a secret.
All right, there is something I haven't told you.
- Yeah?
- But you can't tell Jerry.
What do you think, I tell Jerry everything?
It's not like he's my wife.
Okay.
Well the thing is I've been living a lie.
Just one?
I'm living, like, 20.
What's yours?
Well, I I never actually had cancer.
I'll see you.
So he refused to tell you where he got the glasses?
Flat out refused.
Yeah, isn't that just like him?
You know, he has to be the only one who has them.
Yeah, tell me about it, soul sister.
- Anyway, I told Jake that you said hi.
- What?
- You told Jake I said hi?
- Yeah.
I can't believe you did that.
Why did you tell him I said hi?
I never said hi.
When did I say hi?
- I never heard her say hi.
- It's common courtesy.
No, no, Kramer.
You don't understand.
He made the last contact between us.
I had the upper hand in the post-breakup relationship.
If he thinks that I said hi, then I lose the upper hand.
It's like a game of tag.
- Where are you going?
- Nowhere.
You're going to the bookstore to see Jake.
- So what if I do?
- Listen if you're going, you can get him to tell you where he got those glasses.
Elaine!
Hey.
- How'd it go with Gary?
- Fine.
Fine.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Looks like something's on your mind.
- No, nothing.
I'm fine.
So that's your poker face.
- A regular face.
- No, it isn't.
I've seen your regular face.
That is not it.
What are you saying?
All right, George, come on.
What do you got?
- I got nothing.
- What do got?
A pair of bullets?
What are you talking about?
Two pair?
Three of a kind?
- Will you stop it?
- Oh, my God.
You got a flush.
- You're holding a flush.
- I don't have a flush.
A full house?
You got a full house?
Turn them over, George.
I wanna see them.
Come on.
I'm calling.
- What do you got?
- Gary Fogel never had cancer!
So you see, Kramer took it upon himself to say hi to you for me when in fact, it was an unauthorized hi.
- You didn't say hi?
- That's what I'm saying.
- That's what you came to tell me?
- Correct.
- You never said hi.
- Correct.
- You still like me, don't you?
- Correct.
What?
Hey, I have been trying to get this book signed all day.
How can you say that I still like you when I didn't even say hi to you?
Coming down to say that you didn't say hi is more of a gesture than if you did say hi.
Jake The doctors thought he had cancer but the surgery revealed he never actually had it.
- So, what was wrong with him?
- Nothing.
He's been lying to me for two months?
- That's right.
- What kind of person is this?
There's one other person who might do something like this, and that's you.
- Well - I don't even think you could do it.
No, I could do it.
- Yeah, I guess you could.
- Come on.
He was so worried about losing more hair with chemo treatments I bought him an unlimited gift certificate at the Hair Team For Men just to put his mind at ease?
- You did that?
- Yeah!
- Oh, I can't wait to talk to this guy.
- Wait!
You can't say anything.
- Why not?
- Because he'll know I told you.
Besides, he's giving me a parking spot around the corner for nothing.
So because you're getting free parking I gotta pretend this guy had cancer?
Yeah.
Well, I don't like it.
I don't like it one bit.
And I'm supposed to see him tomorrow.
Maintain the same disposition.
You can't act any differently.
You have to be nice.
- Why didn't he tell me?
- Because you were being so nice.
- I don't think I could be that nice.
- You be nice!
Gary?
What do you think?
Check it out.
- Is that from my gift certificate?
- Yeah, buddy.
You came through.
You've been so nice.
Yeah, well, I'm glad you could take advantage.
Yeah.
Hey, know what I'm thinking of doing?
I'm getting rid of all my fillings because that mercury's toxic.
- Hey, let me see your fillings.
- I don't think so.
Oh, come on.
Open up.
Let me take a look.
You be nice.
He's giving me a parking space.
Parking space.
Parking space.
Well, what do you know.
- Hey, lookie there.
You're loaded.
- Okay.
Hey, look who's over there.
Miss Cool Toes.
Check this out, Jack.
Hey, buddy.
Hey.
Look at you.
What's this?
- It's an eye patch.
- You look like a pirate.
I wanna be a pirate.
- This is Gary.
- How are you doing?
Well, I tell you, there's only one problem.
Can't see on your right side?
No.
It's itchy.
- Nice car.
- Yeah.
Once belonged to Jon Voight.
- Really?
- Sure did.
So, what made you just call me out of the blue like that?
Oh, well, Gary told me you said hi.
- I didn't say hi.
- You didn't?
No, I told him to send you my regards.
I didn't say hi.
- Regards?
- Yeah, regards.
Anyway, I admit I was dumb to go to the bookstore to tell him I didn't say hi, but he didn't have to act so smug.
Oh, I hate smugness.
Don't you hate smugness?
Smugness is not a good quality.
Oh, my God, that man over there.
I think he's wearing glasses that look like Jake's.
Pull over.
Stop the car.
Here.
I think I've got a way of getting back at my ex-boyfriend.
Good.
Revenge is very good.
Excuse me.
- Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Sir, sir?
- Yeah.
If you don't mind my asking, could you tell me where you got your glasses?
- Malaysia.
- Malaysia?
Yeah.
Look, I know this'll sound odd, but can I buy them from you?
Actually, I was gonna buy a new pair.
But I can barely see without these.
- Come on.
- Well, these were expensive.
Let's start the bidding.
So you didn't think this was a date?
No, not really.
Why?
Is it a date?
I thought it was a date.
No, it's not a date.
- What about the regards?
- Regards don't mean anything.
I mean, it's not like I said hi.
I mean, the fact is I shouldn't say anything.
- No, tell me.
- Can you keep a secret?
- Me?
Oh, yeah.
I never had feelings for Gary until he got sick.
But he was so brave and gained such a wonderful perspective on life.
I fell in love with him.
Yeah, he's got some perspective there.
- Hey, you know what the whip does?
- What whip?
The whip in the Senate and the House.
Well, in the old days when the senators didn't vote the way that the party leaders wanted them to, they whipped them.
"You better vote the way we want you to, or there's gonna be big trouble.
" She won't talk to anyone, huh?
Oh, no, she won't say a word to anybody.
Well, she's talking a blue streak now, Jack.
Well, well, the white whale.
Oh, look at this.
There's no place to park around here.
I don't know why they even sell cars here.
Don't complain.
At least you have your health.
George, watch out for that man!
Hey, hey, get back here.
Newman?
The white whale.
Can you believe he sold his glasses on the street?
Can you believe someone would lie about chemotherapy to get a wig?
- Would you do that?
- No, definitely not.
I'm pretty sure I wouldn't.
Know what else?
He picked up that woman in the coffee shop.
- The one who sits by herself?
- Yeah.
- How?
- Because he was brimming with confidence from the toupee.
- Really?
Debby told me she fell in love with him because he has perspective.
She thinks a guy who lies about an illness so he can get some phony hair has perspective?
- He picked her up?
- Walked right over to her table.
Wow.
Jake.
Jake, take a look.
See?
You're not the only one who has them.
I have them too.
- Where did you get those?
- Malaysia.
I was in the area.
- Kramer.
- Just drive.
All right.
Now you listen, and you listen good.
I know who you are.
You're the scofflaw.
- What are you talking about?
- Don't play dumb.
It's me, Cosmo.
All right, so it's me.
So what?
You don't think I know how you're feeling every second of the day?
Looking over your shoulder to see if someone's coming up sitting alone at night knowing they could be closing in.
- I can't sleep, I tell you.
I can't sleep.
- Of course you can't, you poor sap.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I couldn't.
I couldn't tell anyone.
So you've been living this secret by yourself?
- It's been awful.
- Yeah.
I wanted to tell somebody.
- Help me, Kramer.
Help me.
- All right, I'm gonna help you.
I'll try some on, we'll see how they look.
It's just hair.
Ever see what that looks like in the back?
You got natural curls on the bottom and that big phony mat coming down on top of it.
Some look good.
The ones that look good, you don't know about.
What if you got involved with a woman?
How do you tell her?
The way they make them, I'll never have to tell her.
So you keep it a secret your whole life?
Then at your funeral, the mortician comes out, "Mrs. Costanza I thought you might want this.
" It's no secret that it's my dream to have my own publishing house.
If this Jake Jarmel book does, you know, what I think it's gonna do if I can get this whole thing off the ground, then I think I'll have something for you.
- Oh, Mr. Lippman.
That is so exciting.
I mean, you have no idea how sick I am of running around town looking for socks.
By the way, those are great glasses.
- Oh, really, you like them?
- Very unusual.
- Well, you know what?
- What?
- You can have them.
- No, no.
No, no.
Go to that place on the corner.
They'll change the prescription in an hour.
Take them.
- Really?
- I have no use for them.
- Honestly.
- I could use a new pair of reading glasses.
- They're from Malaysia.
- Oh, yeah?
- Fabulous.
Well, Mr. Newman, in all my years on the bench I have never come across anything quite like this.
I have given this matter some serious consideration, and I've decided that what's best for the city and possibly yourself, is for you to keep your car in a garage that is conveniently located next to your home.
I can't afford that.
Afford it you will, Mr. Newman or this court will see that your car is impounded and sold at auction.
Well, don't you worry, Your Honor.
He's in my custody.
Well, what do you think?
I really can't say.
- No, say.
I want you to say.
- It's not good, okay?
It's not good.
You look stupid.
I'm sorry.
You have to realize this has not been custom-fitted to his scalp.
I really think this looks pretty good.
Why not get white shoes, move to Miami Beach and get the whole thing over with?
Maybe you could show me something else.
As I said, it'll be different once we design something specifically for you.
But I don't think your friend here is being very helpful.
Oh, hey.
I'm being helpful.
I am the only one being helpful.
I don't think you're being helpful!
You're being disruptive.
You make it difficult for your friend to improve his life.
I'm preventing him from becoming one of those guys people snicker at because they look ridiculous.
No offense to you personally.
You people with hair think you're so superior.
You have no idea what it's like.
You ever look in the tub and see a fistful of hair?
Start your day with that!
All right.
Take it easy.
Take it easy.
I'm sorry.
Please.
Hey, Jerry.
George, you decided to get a rug.
Good for you, Jack.
Well, I'm just looking, really.
Tommy, I'm gonna need a little adjustment.
I'll be right with you.
Listen, George, I got some bad news.
I'm not gonna be able to give you that parking space.
- What?
- What?
This judge has to use it for some scofflaw.
And you know, you can't fight city hall.
You know, Gary I had a little chat with George the other day.
- You didn't!
- I did.
And he told me that - I'm not 100 percent recovered yet.
- Give me that thing.
How's your life?
All right?
Yeah, not bad at all.
And now, ladies and gentlemen of the press it is my pleasure to introduce you to Mr. Jake Jarmel.
So, Jake, what's your percentage on this book?
Actually, I have some very interesting information on that.
- You know, this is a co-venture - Where did you get those?
- And as such it - Those glasses.
- Where did you get those glasses?
- Where?
Is this supposed to be some kind of a joke on me?
Because it's not very funny.
Give me those.
- I want the glasses.
Give me those.
- Wait.
Calm down.
- Give me those.
- Don't touch me!
I'm gonna go look for some socks.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Oh, hi.
A hundred episodes.
That's a lot.
During the course of which George, Elaine, Kramer and I have had many experiences, both positive and negative.
Well, mostly negative.
There've been some relationships that haven't worked out ambitions that were unfulfilled hopes dashed some property damage, hurt feelings I know one guy got deported.
Physical injury and All right, maybe even a death or two.
But we've persevered.
Because we're people.
Real TV people.
And for 30 minutes a week that's pretty important to us.
So if you're joining us late here's some highlights from what's happened so far.
Why don't they have salsa on the table?
What do you need salsa for?
Salsa is now the number-one condiment in America.
Do you know why?
Because people like to say "salsa.
" Do you have any salsa?
We need more salsa.
Where is the salsa?
No salsa?
You know, it must be impossible for a Spanish person to order seltzer and not get salsa.
I wanted seltzer, not salsa.
Don't you know the difference between them?
You have the seltzer after the salsa.
This should be the show.
This is the show.
- What?
- This.
Just talking.
Yeah.
Right.
No, I'm really serious.
I think that's a good idea.
Just talking?
Well, what's the show about?
It's about nothing.
What's that red dot on your sweater?
Hey, didn't we come in over there?
I thought we came in over there.
I'm out.
- What?
- Yeah, I'm out.
I'm out of the contest.
- No story?
- No, forget the story.
- You gotta have a story.
- Who says you gotta have a story?
Four.
Seinfeld.
Four.
That'll be five, 10 minutes.
What, do you smell something?
Do I smell something?
What am I, hard of smelling?
What is it?
I think its BO.
And who's on the show?
Who are the characters?
I could be a character.
- You?
- Yeah.
You base a character on me.
It's come to my attention that you and the cleaning woman have engaged in sexual intercourse on the desk in your office.
- Who said that?
- She did.
Was that wrong?
Should I not have done that?
I got to plead ignorance on this thing because if anyone had said anything to me when I first started here that that sort of thing was frowned upon And who else is on the show?
Elaine could be a character.
I wonder what happened to my fiancé.
I know he's here somewhere.
I have lost my fiancé, the poor baby.
Maybe the dingo ate your baby.
What?
The dingo ate your baby.
- Kramer.
- Now, he's a character.
The bus is out of control.
So I grab him by the collar, take him out of the seat get behind the wheel.
Now I'm driving the bus.
- You're Batman.
- Yeah.
I am Batman.
Then the mugger, he comes to, and he starts choking me.
So I'm fighting him off with one hand and I kept driving the bus with the other, you know?
Then I managed to open the door and kicked him out the door with my foot, you know, at the next stop.
You kept making all the stops?
Well, people kept ringing the bell!
So everybody I know is a character on the show.
- Right.
My wallet's gone!
My wallet's gone!
- Jerry.
- Uncle Leo.
Hello.
How could you?
- How could I what?
- You were making out during Schindler's List?
How long does it take to find a bra?
What's going on in there?
You ask me to get a pair of underwear, I'm back in two seconds.
You know about the cup sizes and all?
- They have different cups.
- Yeah, I know about the cups.
You got the A the B the C the D. That's the biggest.
I go out for a quart of milk.
I come home and find my son treating his body like it was an amusement park.
I'm a United States postal worker.
Aren't those the guys that always go crazy and come back with a gun and shoot everybody?
Sometimes.
- Why is that?
- Because the mail never stops.
Every day it piles up more and more and you gotta get it out but more keeps coming in!
Then the bar code reader breaks, and it's Publishers Clearing House day!
All right, all right, all right.
So you're saying I go into NBC and tell them I got this idea for a show about nothing.
We go into NBC.
We?
Since when are you a writer?
What writer?
We're talking about a sitcom.
You wanna go with me to NBC?
Yeah, we really got something here.
- What do we got?
- An idea.
- What idea?
- An idea for the show.
- I still don't know what the idea is.
- It's about nothing.
- Right.
- Everybody's doing something.
We'll do nothing.
Come on.
Let's go do something.
I don't want to just sit around here.
- Wanna get something to eat?
- Where?
I don't care.
I'm not hungry.
We could go to one of those cappuccino places.
They let you just sit there.
What are we gonna do there, talk?
We can talk.
I'll go if I don't have to talk.
Then we'll just sit there.
Oh, that's the astronaut pen.
I heard about that.
Where did you get it?
- It was a gift.
- Because a lot of times I write in bed and I have to turn and lean on my elbow to make the pen work.
- Take the pen.
- Oh, no.
- Go ahead.
- I couldn't.
- Take it.
- I can't take it.
- Do me a personal favor.
- I'm not comfortable.
- I cannot take it.
- Take the pen.
- Are you sure?
- I'm positive.
Take the pen.
Okay, thank you very much.
Thank you.
Gee, boy.
- Jack, what are you doing?
- Stop it.
Jack, we should go.
It was nice meeting you.
- Nice to meet you.
- Thanks again.
Come on!
- This?
- Yeah.
- I agreed to wear this?
- Yeah, yeah.
Well, when did I do that?
When we went to dinner the other night.
What, are you crazy?
What were you talking about when I went to the bathroom?
I don't know.
I couldn't understand a word she said.
- I was just nodding.
- There you go.
Where I go?
You mean she was asking me to wear this ridiculous shirt on national TV, and I said yes?
- Yes, yes.
You said it.
I didn't know what she was talking about.
I couldn't hear her.
- Well, she asked you.
- I can't wear this puffy shirt on TV.
I mean, look at it.
It looks ridiculous.
Well, you gotta wear it now.
This pirate trend she's come up with, Jerry This is gonna be the new look for the '90s.
You're gonna be the first pirate.
But I don't wanna be a pirate.
I made a reservation.
Do you have my reservation?
Yes, we do.
Unfortunately, we ran out of cars.
But the reservation keeps the car here.
That's why you have the reservation.
- I know why we have reservations.
- I don't think you do.
If you did, I'd have a car.
See, you know how to take the reservation.
You just don't know how to hold the reservation.
And that's really the most important part of the reservation, the holding.
Anybody can just take them.
I think I can sum up the show for you with one word: Nothing.
- Nothing?
- Nothing.
What does that mean?
What did you do today?
- I got up and came to work.
- There's a show.
That's a show.
How is that a show?
Well, maybe something happens to you on the way to work.
No.

Just clarifying.
Let me ask you this.

There's a hue.
She's got great eyebrows.
Women kill to have her eyebrows.
Who cares about eyebrows?
Look at you.
Why don't you do something with your life?
You sit around here all day.
You contribute nothing to society!
The alarm didn't go off.
You're gonna miss the plane, it's 9:15.

- Yeah.
It's 9:15!
We'll never make it.
I'll leave tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
Are you crazy?
No.
Now, now, let's go.
Let's go.
You get dressed, you get dressed.
I mean, how can I be with someone like you?
Wouldn't respect myself.
Put your pants on.
- I'll go tomorrow or the next day.
- You have your ticket.
- You have to go now.
- We'll never make it.
- Don't say that.
- Well, it takes 45 minutes to get It takes 45 minutes to get there.
That only leaves me five minutes to get to the plane.
- Shut up and pack!
I take it all back!
Every word!
I love you!
I love you!
It's not you.
It's me.
You're giving me the "it's not you, it's me" routine?
I invented "it's not you, it's me.
" Nobody tells me it's them, not me.
- If it's anybody, it's me.
- All right.
- George, it's you.
- You are damn right it's me.
Elaine, you don't know the first thing about first base.
Well, I know something about getting to first base and I know you'll never be there.
The way I figure it, I've already been there.
And I plan on rounding second tonight at around 11:00.
Well, I'd watch the third-base coach if I were you because I don't think he's waving you in.
I guess things changed for me on Tuesday night.
Tuesday night?
What happened Tuesday night?
I saw your act.
My act?
What does that have to do with anything?
Well, to be honest it just didn't make it for me.
It's just so much fluff.
What are you saying?
You didn't like my act?
So that's it?
I can't be with someone if I don't respect what they do.
You're a cashier.
You don't know my name, do you?
- Yes, I do.
- What is it?
It rhymes with a female body part.
What is it?
Mulva?
- I think you're really sick.
- I'm not sick.
You said much sicker things than me.
I'm leaving.
So where were we?
- I was just leaving.
- Right.
You were leaving.
I can't believe you sent a woman into the sauna to do that?
That was an accident.
I think you're both mentally ill.
And by the way, they're real and they're spectacular.
Why shouldn't we be able to do that once in a while if we want to?
- I know.
I mean, really, what is the big deal?
We go in there we're in there for a while, then we come back out here.
That's not complicated.
It's almost stupid if we didn't.
- It's moronic.
- Absurd.
Course I guess maybe some little problems could arise.
There are always a few.
I mean, if anything happened and we couldn't be friends the way we are now, that would really be bad.
- Devastating.
- Because this is very good.
And that would be good.
That would be good too.
The idea is to combine the this and the that.
But this cannot be disturbed.
Yeah, we just want to take this and add that.
But of course, we'd have to figure out a way to avoid the things that cause the little problems.
Maybe some rules or something.
For example: Now I call you whenever I'm inclined, and vice versa.
But if we did that, we might feel a certain obligation to call.
Well, why should that be?
I have an idea.
No calls the day after that.
Beautiful.
Let's make it a rule.
All right, sir.
- Now, here's another little rule.
- Yeah.
When we see each other now we retire to our separate quarters.
But sometimes when people get involved with that they feel pressure to sleep over.
When that is not really sleep.
Sleep is separate from that, and I don't see why sleep got all tied up and connected with that.
Okay, okay, rule number two: Spending the night is optional.
Well, now we're getting somewhere.
I slept with Elaine last night.
- Oxygen.
I need some oxygen.
- I thought you'd like that.
Oh, this is huge!
- I know.
- All right, okay.
Let's go.
Details.
- No, I can't give details.
- No details?
I'm not in the mood.
You ask me here to have lunch tell me you slept with Elaine and then say you're not in the mood for details.
Now, you listen to me.
I want details, and I want them right now.
I don't have a job, I have no place to go.
You're not in the mood?
Well, you get in the mood!
I was at the unemployment office.
I told them I was very close to getting a job with Vandelay Industries and I gave them your phone number.
So when the phone rings you have to answer, "Vandelay Industries.
" - I'm Vandelay Industries?
- Right.
- What is that?
- You're in latex.
- Latex.
- Right.
- What do I do with latex?
- I don't know!
You manufacture it!
- Right here in this little apartment?
- And what do I say about you?
You're considering hiring me for your latex salesman.
- I'll hire you as my latex salesman?
- Right.
I don't think so.
Man, I'm telling you this pizza idea is really gonna happen.
This is the thing where you go and you have to make your own pizza?
We give you the dough.
You smash it.
You pound it.
You fling it up in the air.
And then you get to put your sauce and sprinkle your cheese.
And then, you slide it into the oven.
You have to know how to do that.
You can't have people shoving their arms into a 600-degree oven!
- It's all supervised.
- Oh, well Tolstoy used to write in the village square.
The faces inspired him.
Although, one wonders if War and Peace would have been as highly acclaimed, had it been published under it's original title War What Is It Good For?
- What?
- Yeah.
Mr. Lippman, it was his mistress who insisted that he call it War and Peace.
- Elaine, Elaine.
War What Is It Good For?
Absolutely nothing If I see her, what do I say I'm doing here?
To see me.
I work in the building.
What do you do?
I'm an architect.
You're an architect?
I'm not?
I don't see architecture coming from you.
We'll make our choice in a few days and we'll let you know.
- I have no chance, do I?
- No.
You know I always wanted to pretend I was an architect.
- What do you do?
- I'm an architect.
Have you designed any buildings in New York?
Have you seen the new addition to the Guggenheim?
- You did that?
- Yep, yep.
Really didn't take very long either.
The beauty of my book is, if you don't have a coffee table it turns into a coffee table.
- Is that fabulous?
- Look at this.
What-delay Industries?
- No.
- Vandelay!
Say Vandelay!
No, you're way, way, way off!
- No, say - Vandelay!
Say Vandelay Industries!
No problem, no problem.
And you want to be my latex salesman.
I think Superman probably has a very good sense of humor.
I never heard him say anything funny.
He's got super strength, super speed.
I'm sure he's got super humor.
Either you're born with humor, or you're not.
It's not gonna change.
Even if you go from the red sun of Krypton all the way to the yellow sun of the Earth.
Why?
Why would that one area of his mind not be affected by the yellow sun of the Earth?
I don't know.
But he ain't funny.
- What's today?
- It's Thursday.
Really?
It feels like Tuesday.
Tuesday has no feel.
Monday has a feel.
Friday has a feel.
Sunday has a feel.
- I feel Tuesday and Wednesday.
- Shut up, the both of you.
You double dipped the chip.
Double dipped?
What are you talking about?
You dipped the chip.
You took a bite and you dipped again.
- So?
- It's like putting your whole mouth right in the dip.
From now on, when you take a chip just take one dip and end it.
Could I offer you something to drink?
Okay, yeah.
I'll have a Do you have a decaf cappuccino?
I don't think we have that.
Well, that's a little strange.
- Why does that surprise you?
- Well, it's a very popular drink.
- This is an office.
- That's true.
Magellan?
You like Magellan?
Oh, yeah.
My favorite explorer.
Around the world.
Come on.
- Who do you like?
- I like de Soto.
- De Soto?
What did he do?
- Discovered the Mississippi.
Oh, like they wouldn't have found that anyway.
I was talking to this guy, and I just happened to throw my purse on the sofa.
And my diaphragm goes flying out.
So I just froze, you know: Staring at my diaphragm, you know?
It's just lying there.
So this woman who sold me this hair thing she grabbed it before the guy noticed, so, I mean big deal, right?
So I carry around my diaphragm.
Who doesn't?
I mean, like, it's a big, big secret that women carry around their diaphragms.
You never know when you're gonna need it.
I hate Keith Hernandez.
- Hate him!
- I despise him.
- Why?
- Why?
I'll tell you why.
- Let me tell her.
- You can't - You always tell it.
- All right, tell it.
- You just tell it.
- All right.
June 14th, 1987, Mets-Phillies.
We're enjoying a beautiful afternoon in the right-field stands when a crucial Hernandez error opens the door to a five-run Phillies ninth.
Cost the Mets the game!
Our day was ruined.
There was a lot of people waiting by the players' parking lot.
Now we're coming down the ramp.
Newman was in front of me.
Hernandez was coming toward us.
As he passes us, Newman turns and says, "Nice game, pretty boy.
" Hernandez continued past us up the ramp.
Then, a second later, something happened that changed us in a very deep and profound way from that day forward.
- What was it?
- He spit on us!
And I screamed out, "I'm hit"!
Then I turned, and the spit ricocheted off him, and it hit me.
What a story.
Unfortunately, the immutable laws of physics contradict the whole premise of your account.
Allow me to reconstruct this, if I may, for Ms. Benes as I've heard this story a number of times.
Newman, Kramer, if you'll indulge me.
According to your story Hernandez passes you and starts walking up the ramp.
Then you say you were struck on the right temple.
The spit then proceeds to ricochet off the temple, striking Newman between the third and the forth rib.
The spit then came off the rib made a right turn, hitting Newman in the right wrist causing him to drop his baseball cap.
The spit then splashed off the wrist, pauses in midair, mind you makes a left turn and lands on Newman's left thigh.
That is one magic loogie.
Story is the foundation of all entertainment.
And people really have to care about the characters.
Care?
Forget about care.
Love.
They have to love them.
Now, get the hell out of my house.
Quiet!
You shut up!
At this moment, you're banned from the store.
Banned!
It's a pizza the moment you put your fists in the dough.
I have a hair on my tongue.
Can't get it off.
You know how much I hate that?
Soup's not a meal.
You're supposed to buy me a meal.
Yeah.
Just keep out of my business, you big ape.
Who you calling "big ape"?
I'm calling you an ape.
All right, break it up.
Come on, you two.
Just cut it out now.
But you put on a pair of shoes in the New York Public Library, fella.
We had a funny guy with us in Korea.
A tail gunner.
They blew his brains out all over the Pacific.
There's nothing funny about that.
We will annex Poland by the spring at any cost!
And our stock will rise high.
You think you're an idiot, but with all due respect I'm a much bigger idiot than you are.
Don't insult me, my friend.
Remember who you're talking to.
No one's a bigger idiot than me.
Am I a hipster doofus?
- No.
- No.
Said I'm not good-looking enough.
Not good-looking.
Jerry, look at me.
Look at my face.
Am I beautiful?
George, am I beautiful?
- You're very attractive.
- Yeah.
Is it possible I'm not as attractive as I think I am?
We're not gay.
Not that there's anything wrong with that.
- No, of course not.
- It's fine, if that's who you are.
- Absolutely.
- I mean, I have many gay friends.
- My father's gay.
- Look I know what I heard.
- Heard.
It was a joke.
- Look, you wanna have sex right now?
Do you wanna have sex with me right now?
Let's go.
Come on!
Let's go, baby!
Come on!
Hey, come on.
Let's go.
I thought we were gonna take a steam.
- No, I don't want any steam.
- No.
No steam.
Well, I don't wanna sit there naked all by myself.
- You've faked?
- On occasion.
- And the guy never knows?
- No.
How can he not know that?
Because I was good.
I guess after that many beers, he's probably a little groggy anyway.
Well, you didn't know.
What's that?
You didn't know.
- Are you saying..
?
- I think I'll have a piece of cake.
- With me?
- Well - You faked with me?
- Yeah.
- You faked with me?
- Yes.
- No.
You faked it?
- Yes.
I faked it.
That whole thing, the whole production, it was all an act?
Not bad, huh?
What about the breathing, the panting, the moaning, the screaming?
Fake, fake, fake, fake.
I'm disturbed.
I'm depressed.
I'm inadequate.
I got it all!
Can't you see what's happened?
I've become George.
Don't say that.
It's true.
I'm George.
I'm George.
Tuna on toast, coleslaw cup of coffee.
- Yeah.
No, no, wait a minute.
I always have tuna on toast.
Nothing's every worked out for me with tuna on toast.
I want the complete opposite of tuna on toast.
Chicken salad on rye untoasted, with a side of potato salad and a cup of tea.
Well, there's no telling what can happen from this.
Chicken salad's not the opposite of tuna.
Salmon's the opposite of tuna because salmon swim against the current, and the tuna swim with it.
Good for the tuna.
George, you know that woman just looked at you.
So what?
What am I supposed to do?
Go talk to her.
Elaine, bald men with no jobs and no money who live with their parents don't approach strange women.
Try the opposite.
Instead of tuna salad and being intimidated by women, chicken salad and going right up to them.
- Yeah, I should do the opposite.
If every instinct you have is wrong then the opposite would have to be right.
Yes.
I will do the opposite.
I used to sit here and do nothing and regret it for the rest of the day.
So now I will do the opposite, and I will do something.
Excuse me.
I couldn't help but notice that you were looking in my direction.
- Oh, yes, I was.
You just ordered the same exact lunch as me.
My name is George.
I'm unemployed, and I live with my parents.
I'm Victoria.
Hi.
Catch phrases Boy, these pretzels are making me thirsty.
These pretzels are making me thirsty.
These pretzels are making me thirsty!
Boy, I'm really starting to dislike the Drake.
Hate the Drake!
You are so good-looking.
You can't believe her.
She's one of these low-talkers.
Because he's a high talker.
He's nice.
Bit of a close talker.
How about you, Jerry?
I'm swamped.
You sure?
You can examine the artwork up close.
I don't have a square to spare.
I can't spare a square.
I need hand!
I have no hand!
- Newman.
- Newman.
- Newman.
- Hello, Newman.
So you're still master of your domain.
Yes.
Master of my domain.
I am king of the county.
Lord of the manor.
I'm queen of the castle.
- You mean shrinkage.
- Yes.
Significant shrinkage.
So you feel you were shortchanged?
Yes.
If she thinks that's me, she's under a complete misapprehension.
Well, so, what's the difference?
- What if she discusses it with Jane?
- Oh, she's not gonna tell Jane.
Could you tell her about the shrinkage factor?
I'm not gonna tell her about your shrinkage.
Besides, I think women know about shrinkage.
How do women know about shrinkage?
Isn't it common knowledge?
- Elaine.
- Elaine.
Elaine!
- What?
- Do women know about shrinkage?
What do you mean, like laundry?
No.
Like when a man goes swimming, afterwards It shrinks?
Like a frightened turtle.
- Why does it shrink?
- It just does.
I don't know how you guys walk around with those things.
- about the script.
The script.
Now, I've read this thing three times.
Yeah.
And every time I read it What?
- Excuse me for a second.
- What?
Would you like a Pepto-Bismol?
I keep them in my wallet.
You think he liked it?
I'm not sure.
The air conditioner!
My mother caught me.
Caught you?
Doing what?
You know.
I was alone You mean..
?
- She caught you?
- Where?
I stopped by the house to drop the car off and I went inside for a few minutes.
Nobody was there.
They're supposed to be working.
My mother had a Glamour magazine.
I started leafing through it.
Glamour?
- So one thing led to another.
- What did she do?
First she screams, "George, what are you doing?
My God"!
Looked like she was gonna faint.
She started clutching the wall, trying to hang onto it.
I didn't know whether to keep her from falling or zip up.
- What did you do?
- I zipped up.
- So she fell?
- Yeah.
Well, I couldn't run over there the way I was.
- No, I guess you couldn't.
- I wouldn't think so.
So she fell, and then she starts screaming, "My back, my back"!
I picked her up.
I took her to the hospital.
- How is she?
- She's in traction.
- I'm sorry.
- It's not funny, Elaine.
I know.
I'm sorry.
It's serious.
Her back went out.
She's gotta be there for a couple days.
Glamour?
I'll tell you this, though: I am never doing that again.
What?
You mean in your mother's house or altogether?
- Altogether.
- Give me a break.
Yeah, right.
- You don't think I can?
- No chance.
- You think you could?
- I could hold out longer than you.
Care to make it interesting?
Sure.
How much?
Hundred dollars?
You're on.
Wait a second.
Wait a second.
Count me in on this.
You?
You'll be out before we get the check.
I want in on this.
- No, no.
- It's apples and oranges.
- It's different.
- Why?
Why?
- Because you're a woman.
- So what?
It's easier for a woman not to do it than a man.
We have to do it.
It's part of our lifestyle.
It's like shaving.
That is such baloney.
I shave my legs.
Not every day.
- You wanna be in?
- Yeah.
You gotta give us odds.
At least 2-1.
You gotta put up $200.
No.
A thousand.
No.
I'll put up 150.
- All right.
You're in for 150.
- Okay, 150.
How we gonna monitor this?
Obviously, we all know each other very well.
I'm sure we'll all feel comfortable within the confines of the honor system.
All right.
Come on.
Fire!
We have sacrificed everything, all for the sake of our little bubble boy.
- Excuse me.
- Oh, here.
Amazing how many beautiful women live in New York.
You're as pretty as any of them.
Just need a nose job.
Yankee bean.
Yankee bean.
I like my Yankee bean.
In fact, I hate anyone that ever had a pony when they were growing up.
I had a pony.
Well, I didn't When I was a little girl in Poland we all had ponies.
My sister had pony.
My cousin had pony.
- So, what's wrong with that?
- Nothing, nothing at all.
He was a beautiful pony, and I loved him.
Well, I'm sure you did.
Who wouldn't love a pony?
Who wouldn't love a person that had a pony?
You.
You said so.
It's my father's cabin!
I just realized, you never gave me back the change from the tolls.
So you heard that I was in a car accident and then decided to stop off for some Jujyfruit?
Well the counter was right there.
I didn't know she had a pony.
Who figures an immigrant is gonna have a pony?
I mean, in all the pictures I saw of immigrants on boats coming into New York Harbor I never saw one of them sitting on a pony.
But why would anyone come here if they had a pony?
Who leaves a country packed with ponies to go to a non-pony country?
It doesn't make sense.
Now we'll open the peritoneal cavity exposing the body's internal organs.
- What are you eating?
- Junior Mints.
- You want one?
- No.
Now, I can't see.
Could you get..
?
Where'd you get those?
- The machine.
You want one?
- No.
- Here.
Take one.
- I don't want one.
- They're good.
- I don't want any.
- Just take one.
- No.
Stop Kramer, stop it.
It's a Junior Mint.
Drake's Coffee Cake?
- Snapple?
- No, thanks.
- Snapple?
- No, thanks.
- PEZ?
- No.
A box of Jujyfruits?
- Clark Bar.
- I love Yoo-hoo.
- Oh, Chunkys.
- Chocolate babka.
It's Gore-Tex.
- Cashmere?
- No, Gore-Tex.
Who's gonna turn down a Junior Mint?
It's chocolate, it's peppermint.
It's delicious.
- That's true.
- It's very refreshing.
What's going on over here?
There's a beached whale.
She's dying.
Is anyone here a marine biologist?
The sea was angry that day, my friends.
Like an old man trying to send back soup in a deli.
I got about 50 feet out, when suddenly the great beast appeared before me.
I tell you, he was 10 stories high if he was a foot.
As if sensing my presence, he let out a great bellow.
I said, "Easy, big fella.
" And then, as I watched him struggling, I realized that something was obstructing its breathing.
From where I was standing, I could see into the eye of the great fish.
- Mammal.
- Whatever.
- What did you do next?
- Well, then from out of nowhere, a huge tidal wave lifted me tossed me like a cork, and I found myself on top of him face to face with the blowhole.
I could barely see from the waves crashing down upon me but I knew something was there.
So I reached my hand in felt around, and pulled out the obstruction.
What is that, a Titleist?
A hole in one, huh?
We go into NBC, tell them we got an idea for a show about nothing.
- Exactly.
- "What's your show about"?
- I say, "Nothing.
" - There you go.
I think you may have something here.
Why don't you two go to the movies by yourselves.
I'm not in the mood.
Well, me either.
I'm going to Sky Burger.
- So you're not going?
- You don't need us.
Well, I can't go to a bad movie by myself.
What, am I gonna make sarcastic remarks to strangers?
I guess I'll just go to my uncle's.
- Should we tell him we're leaving?
- What for?
Let's just get out of here.
Seinfeld, four!
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 16}
The whole concept of the wanted poster has gotta be the most optimistic crime-fighting idea.
I mean, so how does it work?
Okay.
I'm on line at the post office.
I see the guy.
I see the list of offenses.
I check the guy standing in line behind me.
If it's not him, that's pretty much all I can do.
Okay?
It's not that I don't want to help.
Annoying thing is, why didn't they hold on to this guy when they're taking his picture?
"No, we don't do it that way.
We take their picture and we let them go.
That's how we get the front and side shot.
The front is his face.
The side is him leaving.
" Look at you.
Why don't you use a fork.
You're no good with the sticks.
I know.
I need a lesson.
You stink.
You know you stink.
What is this?
Oh, my ballet tickets.
Oh, your ballet tickets.
Have you ever been to the ballet?
No, but I've seen people on tiptoes.
- You know, I'm going as a beard.
- A beard?
Yeah.
This friend of a friend knows this banker guy.
He's 30-ish, unbelievably gorgeous.
- Of course he's gay.
- Yeah.
So anyway, his boss has this box at the Met, and he invited him to go see Swan Lake with him and his wife.
But he's afraid his boss can't handle his orientation.
So I'm going along as his date.
- Why are you doing this?
- Swan Lake at the Met.
- Yeah?
- Get it on with your bad self.
Chinese food.
I knew I smelled something.
- Yeah.
- Is George still wearing that toupee?
- Yeah.
- Doesn't he know how ridiculous he looks in that thing?
- I think he looks fantastic.
Oh, come on.
I never realized what an attractive man he is.
Oh, he's a real looker, that one.
- Hey.
- People, people, people.
Not bad, huh?
All right.
Excuse me.
You look ridiculous in that thing.
Is that so?
Or could it be that you're just a little bit worried that you may have missed the boat?
Well, I think they might have sutured that thing to your brain.
Oh, all right.
Go ahead.
Deride.
Deride if you must.
But let me tell you something.
With my personality and this head of hair, you know what I am now?
I am in the game.
I no longer defer to the coifed.
I'm a player.
You know, I thought of something.
I know this gorgeous woman.
She called me up this morning.
She's moving into the city, and she asked if I knew anyone she could meet.
Now you can go out with her.
- Well, what about me?
- No, I think he's got you beat, buddy.
- So she's gorgeous?
- Yeah.
Last time I saw her she was.
- Five years ago.
- You got a picture?
No, no.
Well, I have to see her.
Hey.
I know what we can do.
I got a friend, works at the police station.
- He's a composite artist.
- Really?
- I can get him to draw a picture of her.
- I would love that.
- You think he'd really do it?
- I think he will.
It sounds like an excellent idea.
You done with all this?
I'm gonna give it to a homeless person.
Yeah, I'm very excited about this.
I always wanted to see how these sketch artists do it.
Here you go, brother.
Some food for you.
Thank you.
You're a good man.
Bless you.
- You gonna be here in an hour?
- Where am I going?
All right.
Enjoy.
Wait up!
That's good.
And make the eyes - What's that nut?
- Almonds?
Almonds.
Yeah.
That's good.
- Can I see..
?
- No, no.
Not yet.
Yeah.
And make the lips fuller, poutier.
Pouty?
I like that.
- You can't go wrong with pouty.
- I'm excited about the pouty.
- All right.
I think that about does it.
- George, come on.
Take a look.
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, my God.
You were right.
She is gorgeous.
Hey, Lou, who's that woman over there?
Her?
Oh, that's Sergeant Tierney.
- Nice officer.
- You wanna meet her?
Well, this worked out okay.
You gonna see that policewoman?
Yeah.
I think I will.
I like the idea of having the law on my side.
- Hey, man.
Did you enjoy the food?
- Yes, I did.
Where did the Chinese learn to cook like that?
Listen.
I'll take that Tupperware now.
I don't think so.
That's mine.
- You gave it to me.
- I didn't say you could keep it.
See, I don't give away Tupperware.
- You should've said something.
- I didn't think I had to.
Look, with a piece of Tupperware, you just assume.
Oh, yeah!
I've really gotta thank you for this.
The bank I work for is so conservative.
Well, by now you'd think people would be a little more open-minded.
Excuse me.
I have to run to the bathroom.
- Okay.
- Great.
So - You and Robert?
- Yep.
- Really?
- Yes, indeedy.
I'm surprised.
Really?
Why?
No reason.
Well, believe me.
This didn't happen overnight.
Robert is not exactly a one-woman man, if you know what I mean.
No, sirree, Bob.
Sure, I mean, in a lot of ways he's a typical guy.
He likes his sports.
But he counters that side with the side you see here tonight at the ballet or the pleasure he gets watching Liza Minnelli belt out a few choice numbers.
It's those two halves of his personality that just come together to make him the very special guy that he is.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
Oh, hi, honey.
It was just such a great night.
And did they suspect anything?
No, I was a fantastic beard.
I held hands.
I called him "honey.
" And we discover yet another talent: posing as a girlfriend for homosexuals.
Oh, it was just such a great night.
You said that already.
- Oh, I did?
- Yeah.
Oh, no.
Don't tell me You like him?
He's incredible.
Yeah, but Yeah.
I know.
- So?
- What?
Not conversion?
You're thinking conversion?
Well, it did occur to me.
You think you can get him to change teams?
He's not gonna suddenly switch sides.
Forget about it.
Why?
Is it irrevocable?
Because when you join that team, it's not a whim.
He likes his team.
He's set with that team.
- But we've got a good team.
- Yeah, we do.
We do have a good team.
Well, why can't he play for us?
They're only comfortable with their equipment.
But we just got along so great.
Of course.
Everyone gets along great when there's no possibility of sex.
No, no, no.
I sensed something.
I did sense something.
I perceived a possibility, Jerry.
You realize you're venturing into uncharted waters?
I realize that.
Are you that desperate?
Yes, I am.
Are you gonna bring your gun?
Yeah, I think you should leave it at home.
I don't really know you that well.
What if we get into a fight or something?
You know, you lose your temper.
Who knows what you're capable of.
All right.
Then it's settled.
First date, no weapons.
All right.
I'll see you then.
Okay, bye.
Yeah, yeah.
Here we go.
- What are you looking for?
- Tupperware.
Sorry.
I don't have any Tupperware.
See, I knew this was gonna happen.
I just made a delicious casserole, but it won't keep because I have no Tupperware.
- What about a plastic bag?
- You must be kidding.
What is the difference?
The patented burp, Jerry.
It locks in freshness.
- Hey.
- Hey.
So I spoke to your little friend Denise last night.
Oh, yeah.
You talked, huh?
Yeah.
For two hours.
She's nuts about you.
Yeah.
We go way back, you know.
Why didn't anything ever happen between you two?
Who's to say it didn't?
So did you describe yourself to her over the phone?
Yes, I did.
- What did you say?
- What do you think I said?
I don't know.
I told her the truth.
As you see it?
Yes, as I see it.
Did you tell her about your little hat there?
What hat?
You know, your little hair hat there.
- No.
- Don't you think she could tell?
No, no, no.
She can't tell.
It's a perfect match.
Beautiful job.
Are you kidding?
I could spot that bird's nest two blocks away.
You only think that because you know me.
Noticed people staring at your head?
I noticed people staring at my head because they like what they see.
You should either take it off or tell her about it.
He's not gonna take it off.
If he was gonna go bald I never would have introduced them.
- I guarantee she won't know.
- Yeah.
That's it.
I'm gonna go down to the precinct, have lunch with Lou.
Oh, I'll split a cab with you.
Hey, I'm really sorry about the other day, man.
Really sorry.
Hey, that's my coffee.
- Hi, sarge.
- Hi.
I'm sorry I'm late.
Some of our lineup decoys didn't show, so Hey, any of you guys want to be in the lineup, make a quick 50 bucks?
Sure, I will.
Perfect.
Okay.
Just go right over there with Officer Lampart.
All right.
All of you, turn to the left.
The left.
Now, turn to the right.
Oh, my God.
There she is.
That's the face.
Just like the picture.
- George?
- Yeah.
Hi.
- It's great to meet you.
- Likewise.
- Have you been waiting long or..
?
- No.
I got here two minutes ago.
Good, good.
Well, why don't you take off your hat, stay a while.
- What's that?
- A polygraph.
What you civilians call a lie detector test.
Let me ask you.
Now, when someone is lying is it true that their pants are actually on fire?
If I could tell you the famous faces that have been up here Get out.
A certain cast member of Melrose Place.
Really?
- Have you ever seen the show?
- No.
You can admit it, Jerry.
It's okay.
I'd admit it.
I don't watch it.
Hey, Lou.
Maybe we should put him on the poly.
- The poly?
- Yeah.
I think you've seen it.
Melrose Place?
Yes, Melrose Place.
- I just didn't know you watch that.
- Well, I do.
Every time I've mentioned it you never say anything or join in the conversation.
Well, maybe I was a little embarrassed.
You mean, this whole time, we could have been discussing Sydney and Michael and Jane?
And Billy and Jake and Allison.
Yes, we could have discussed it.
Why?
Why were you so embarrassed?
I'm gonna be taking this lie detector test.
That needle's gonna be going wild.
This is so stupid.
- Why don't you just confess?
- It's too stupid to confess.
Look what I'm confessing to.
Well, what are you gonna do?
I don't know.
Maybe I could beat the machine.
Who do you think you are, Costanza?
Hey, you know what?
I have access to one of the most deceitful, duplicitous deceptive minds of our time.
Who better to advise me?
Oh, God, this is terrible.
- Did you shake it up?
- No.
- You gotta shake it up.
- No.
I'm sick of shaking.
You gotta shake everything.
Yeah, that's a real nuisance.
Oh, this is killing me.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
So I'm going out tonight with Robert and the boss and his wife.
So tonight you gonna make the move?
Yeah, I think I might.
Hey, there he is.
So, what happened?
Could she detect it?
- That's an interesting question.
- How so?
How so?
I'll tell you how so.
She's bald.
What do you mean, "bald"?
What do you think I mean?
Bald.
Bald.
Bald, bald.
- She's bald?
- She's bald, Jerry.
- Oh, come on.
- Oh, come on?
No "come on.
" She took off her hat, and there she was.
"Hello.
" It was like I was looking at myself in the mirror.
Well, maybe she got a haircut or something.
You know, let me tell you something.
No one walks into a beauty parlor and says, "Give me the Larry Fine.
" Women go bald?
Yeah, I've heard of that.
I mean, they usually wear a wig.
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.
Hey.
You fixed me up with a bald woman.
- Bald?
- Yeah, that's right.
Do you see the irony here?
You're rejecting somebody because they're bald.
So?
You're bald!
No, I'm not.
I was bald.
Elaine.
Hey, hey.
Hey, come on.
No, no, no!
Elaine!
I don't like this thing!
And here's what I'm doing with it!
Don't!
- You started that fight with me.
- I figured that's what couples do.
You almost convinced me we were a couple.
It was easy.
Really.
Well, good night.
I'll call you tomorrow.
Oh, wait a second.
Would you like to come upstairs?
Upstairs?
Yeah.
Upstairs?
Elaine I was hoping, you know you might be interested in changing teams.
Changing teams?
Have you ever thought about it?
But I'm a starting shortstop.
Robert, we need a shortstop.
Real bad.
When she threw that toupee out the window it was the best thing that ever happened to me.
I feel like my old self again: totally inadequate, completely insecure paranoid, neurotic.
It's a pleasure.
It's good to have you back.
You know what else I've decided to do?
I'm gonna keep seeing the bald woman.
She's as good as anybody else.
Scalp was clean.
She had a nice skull.
There just wasn't a lot of hair on it.
You know, you've had, like, a religious awakening.
You're like a bald-again.
Gonna need a little more coffee here.
So, George, how do I beat this lie detector?
I'm sorry.
Jerry, I can't help you.
You got the gift.
You're the only one that could help me.
Jerry, I can't.
It's like saying to Pavarotti, "Teach me to sing like you.
" All right.
Well, I gotta go take this test.
I can't believe I'm doing this.
Jerry, just remember: It's not a lie if you believe it.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I did it.
- What?
- I turned him.
He defected.
Get out.
How?
- How did you do that?
- Because I'm a woman.
Do you know what you've done?
You've given hope to every woman who's ever said, "Too bad he's gay.
" Well, it's a lesson for the kids out there.
Anything is possible.
Indeed.
Jeromy, I have hit the jackpot.
The perfect man.
Nothing but sex and shopping.
What's your name?
Jerry Seinfeld.
What is your address?
Did Kimberly steal Jo's baby?
I don't know.
Did Billy sleep with Allison's best friend?
I don't know.
Did Jane's fiancé kidnap Sydney and take her to Las Vegas?
And if so, did she enjoy it?
I don't know.
Did Jane sleep with Michael again?
Yes!
Yes.
That stupid idiot.
He left her for Kimberly.
He slept with her sister, tricked her into giving him half her business.
Then she goes and sleeps with him again?
She's crazy.
How could she do something like that?
That Jane!
Oh, she just makes me so mad!
He went back?
What do you mean, he went back?
He went back.
I don't understand.
You were having a great time.
The sex, the shopping.
Well, here's the thing.
Being a woman I only really have access to the equipment what, 30, 45 minutes a week?
And that's on a good week.
How can I be expected to have the same expertise as people who own this equipment and have access to it You can't.
That's why they lose very few players.
Yeah, I guess I never really stood a chance.
Well, there's always a place for you on our team.
Yeah, thanks.
Is Melrose Place on?
- Yeah, coming on in a few minutes.
- Okay.
Hey.
Don't worry, it hasn't started.
Hey, you know, George, I am really proud of you.
I really do admire what you've done.
Do you?
That makes me so happy.
Elaine's proud of me, Jerry.
What is the matter?
I got rejected by a bald woman.
- What?
- A bald woman rejected me.
You like that one?
A woman with no prospects and no hair told me that I wasn't her type.
Apparently baldy likes a slimmer guy.
Well, I'll tell you what I think.
I think she saw you with that piece off and was devastated.
You blew it, boy.
You really blew it!
And you had to ruin it for him, didn't you?
I didn't ruin anything.
He looked like an idiot.
- No.
- And it made him act like a jerk.
All right.
Shut up.
Shut up.
Melrose Place is coming on.
Oh, that Michael.
I hate him.
He's just so smug.
Hey, how you doing, Stu?
Eddie, my man, huh?
You again?
Boy, you're a slippery one.
You better straighten up and fly right, buddy boy.
- What do you got?
- An eyewitness to that jewelry store break-in.
Come here.
Do you recognize anybody in this lineup?
That's the guy, officer.
The guy there in the middle.
The tall guy with the high hair.
I'd recognize him anywhere.
Hey, you.
You with the high hair.
Step forward.
Me?
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
I was thinking about hair and that the weird thing about it is that people will touch other people's hair.
You will actually kiss another human being right on the head but if one of those hairs should somehow be able to get out of that skull and go off on its own it is now the vilest, most disgusting thing that you can encounter.
The same hair.
People freak out, "There was a hair in the egg salad.
" Say it's Saturday night in Spain.
They go out dancing.
Think they do the flamenco?
I would think.
So you could call a woman for a date ask her if she's free for dinner and a flamenco.
You don't flamenco on the first date.
I wish the flamenco was popular here.
- Yeah?
Would you do it?
- Yes, I think I would.
Well, I knew you had an affinity for it because it's the dance of a very proud people.
Hello.
Oh, hi, Nana.
What?
Oh, all right.
Okay, don't worry about it.
Okay, I'll see you later.
All right, bye.
- I have to go over my grandmother's.
- What for?
I have to open a bottle of ketchup for her.
- So, what, no lunch?
- No, we have time.
- How's she doing?
- She's starting to slip a little.
She has trouble distinguishing between the past and the present.
There's gotta be an easier way to open ketchup.
They should make it in a tube.
- Like toothpaste?
- Yeah.
- There's a squeeze ketchup.
- I've seen squeeze mustard.
- I've never seen squeeze ketchup.
- If they make squeeze mustard doesn't it stand to reason they make squeeze ketchup?
Not necessarily.
Mustard lends itself to the squeeze.
- I don't see the difference.
- There's a difference.
- It's subtle.
- It's subtle?
Hey, isn't Elaine supposed to meet us?
Yeah, there she is.
What?
She's with her friend Wendy.
Wendy?
Is that the physical therapist?
Yeah.
I'm on a kiss-hello program with her.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Every time I see her I gotta kiss hello.
I did it once on her birthday.
Somehow it mushroomed.
Now I dread seeing her because of it.
- Hey.
- I'm down to one kiss hello.
- My aunt Celia.
- That's fortunate.
I really admire that.
Really?
I never heard you say you admired me for anything.
No, I told you I admire your hearing.
Oh, don't slough that off.
You have great hearing.
- Hey.
- Hi.
- Did you ever meet George?
- Wendy.
- You're a physical therapist, right?
- Yes.
You know, I got this little swelling right here.
It's kind of painful.
What do you make of that?
- George - Have you tried heat and ice on it?
Oh, that That really seems like a lot of trouble.
You could come by my office later.
I could work on it for you.
Oh, okay.
Let me give you my card.
- Oh, thank you.
- Well, I'll see you guys later.
- Nice meeting you.
Bye.
- Bye, Wendy.
I'm sorry.
- Bye, Jerry.
- Bye.
- What did you do that for?
- What?
Ask about your arm.
I still don't see why I can't ask her about my arm.
She's a physical therapist.
She doesn't wanna have to deal with that outside the office.
- Why not?
- Because it is what she does.
I love these people.
You can't ask them questions.
They're so mentally gifted that we mustn't disturb the delicate genius unless it's in the confines of an office.
When huge sums of money are involved, the genius can be disturbed.
George, you got a little something right here.
- People think they're so important.
- I'm going on record right now.
That was my last kiss hello.
I am getting off the kiss program with her.
- Why?
- Well, you know, frankly outside of a sexual relationship, I don't see the point to it.
I'm not thrilled with the handshaking either, but one step at a time.
- What are you getting?
- And what's with that hairdo?
Oh, yeah.
I know.
It's not very flattering.
I mean, she looks like something out of an old high school yearbook.
You should say something to her.
Oh, I could never say anything to her about that.
Yeah, Kramer's the only person who could say something like that.
- Yeah.
- Well, just tell Kramer to tell her.
No.
If you tell him to do it, he'll never do it.
What you have to do is introduce him, and then he'll just come out with it.
Yes.
Yes, you're right.
That's right.
I'll bring her over to meet Kramer.
- Hi.
- Hey.
Hello, boys and girls.
Yeah.
Hey, listen.
I need a picture of you, buddy.
- What for?
- I'm putting everybody's picture up in the lobby of our building.
- Why?
Everyone will know everybody's name.
People are gonna be a lot friendlier.
I don't want my picture plastered up in the lobby.
Imagine walking by someone on the floor and you say, "Hey, Carl" and he says, "Hey, Jerry.
" That's the kind of society I wanna live in.
Kramer, I don't wanna stop and talk every time I go in the building.
I just wanna nod and be on my way.
You know, your eyeliner's smudged a little.
Why do you wear so much eye makeup?
Yeah.
This is gonna work out just fine.
Ma, again with the ketchup?
Don't they have them in the plastic squeeze containers?
Jerry.
Hello.
Hello, Uncle Leo.
- What are you doing here?
- Nana called me to open the bottle.
Yeah, me too.
- Hello, Jerry.
- Hi, Nana.
- Aren't you gonna kiss her hello?
- Yes, yes, of course.
Well, here's the bottle.
- I'll do it.
- I got it.
- Give it to me.
- Stop it.
- Jerry, would you give me the bottle?
- Uncle Leo.
All right.
Take it.
You should let Buddy open it.
Buddy?
He lived next door to us - Leo, did you give Helen the $50?
- What $50?
Your father won $1000 at the track last week and he gave you 100 and you were supposed to give $50 to your sister.
Ma, Dad died in 1962.
Believe me, I don't owe your mother $50.
I'm not getting any hot water.
I know there's nothing worse than when your shower's not working.
- I'm gonna take care of it.
- Thanks, Julio.
All right.
- Oh, hey.
- Hey, hey.
Hello.
- What's going on here?
- Nothing, nothing.
- Well, then what are you doing?
- I need a pen.
- What for?
- Well, I'm making out my will.
Oh, I got a big slice of dough for you, buddy and you too.
I haven't forgotten you.
You're looking for a picture of me?
You got that straight.
I told you, forget it.
Oh, come on, Jerry.
If everybody knew everybody we wouldn't have the problems we have in the world.
You don't rob somebody if you know their name.
You're robbing me.
I'm gonna get your picture, and you're gonna participate in my program.
- Are you going home?
- Yeah.
Can you come back in about five minutes?
Why?
No reason.
Just wanna see you again.
- You sure Wendy's coming?
- Yeah, she'll be here any second.
This will be an interesting experiment to see if Kramer says something.
- You wanna go through with this?
- Listen, Jerry, she never dates and I know it's because of her hair.
Hello.
Oh, hi, Mom.
Yeah, I was at Nana's yesterday.
I had to help her open a ketchup bottle.
Hey, Mom, let me ask you a question.
Do you remember when you were a kid your father winning, like, $1000 at the track?
Really?
Did you know he gave Uncle Leo $100 and he was supposed to give you 50?
How do I know?
Because Nana doesn't know what year it is and she thinks this just happened.
Well, I think you should.
Okay.
Bye.
Do you know what the interest on that $50 comes to over 53 years?
Oh, Morty, please.
$663.45 and that's figuring conservatively at 5 percent interest over 53 years compounded quarterly.
- Or if you put it into a 10-year T-bill - Morty, will you stop it?
Well, he's not getting away with this.
- Yeah?
- It's Wendy.
Come on up.
- This is it.
Should I go get Kramer?
- No, no.
He'll come in.
This is gonna be my first opportunity to not kiss her hello.
What is the big deal about putting your lips on somebody's face?
It's the obligation.
You know, as soon as this person comes in you know you have to do this.
I mean, if you could, say, touch a breast as part of the kiss hello then I think I could see the value in it a little better.
How about an intercourse hello?
How would that be?
Elaine, now you're being ridiculous.
- That's her.
That's her.
- Wait, wait.
- What?
- Okay, go, go, go.
- Hi, Wendy.
- Hi, Elaine.
- Hi, Wendy.
- Oh, hi, Jerry.
- Would you like something to drink?
- Sure.
There you go.
Oh, look at that.
I'm almost out of Klondike bars.
So how's everything going?
Oh, okay.
Your friend George came by the office the other day.
And then yesterday, he canceled on me.
Yeah, he had to take his mother to the chiropodist.
Oh, did you hear that?
That must be Kramer.
Hey, Jerry.
- Come on.
That's not fair.
- I told you I was gonna get it.
- No, come on.
Give me the picture.
- No, no, no.
All right, fine.
Put my picture up.
What do I care?
Kramer, Kramer, I'd like you to meet my friend Wendy.
- Oh, hello.
- Hi.
You know, I really like that hairdo.
Thank you.
I actually was thinking it might be time for a change.
- Oh, you were?
- No, no.
You don't wanna do that.
- Nobody wears it like that.
- No, Kramer if she wants to change her hair - No.
You'd be a damn fool to change it.
- It's very becoming.
- Oh, well.
So who's that friend of yours, that guy who came in?
- Oh, Kramer.
- Yeah.
Does he have a girlfriend?
You wanna go out with him?
Well, why not?
Well, it's just that That I What, is there anything wrong with him?
Elaine?
No, I'm just thinking about the question.
You know, my arm feels a lot better.
That Wendy really knows her stuff.
- She is super.
- Yeah.
Same time tomorrow?
Yeah, same time.
There you go.
Oh, you owe 150.
- What for?
- Well, you canceled on Tuesday and our policy is 24 hours' notice for all cancellations.
Well, I couldn't come.
I had to drive my mother to the chiropodist.
- What's the problem?
- I'm being charged for Tuesday.
I had to take my mother to the chiropodist.
Well, I'm sorry.
That's our policy.
Oh, you have a policy.
The delicate genius has a policy.
So will you be here tomorrow?
Well, it's less than 24 hours, so I guess I have to.
Hey.
So, what do you think?
You like it?
Oh, my God.
Look at that picture.
That's terrible.
You can't put that picture up.
Well, it's not a beauty contest.
It's just a way for people to get to know one another.
- Hi, Cosmo.
- Hey Steve.
Now, you see?
Hey, Kramer.
My friend Wendy wants to go out with you.
Well, how do you do?
Hello, Jerry.
Oh, hello Mary.
I've seen you so many times, and now we can finally talk to each other.
See, what was I telling you?
Isn't this nice?
Jerry, you know, could you help me with a package?
- Oh, sure.
Yeah.
- Thank you.
Oh, no.
You see, that's just what I need, more kissing.
What is so funny?
Nothing.
Nothing.
Hello.
Oh, hi, Ma.
What?
Oh, Ma, he didn't?
He couldn't.
All right, I will.
Okay, bye.
Uncle Leo put Nana in a home.
- Why?
- I don't know.
Maybe to keep her quiet.
Hi, Jerry.
- Hi, Joan.
- How you doing?
- Pretty good.
- Just pretty good?
Not great?
Okay, great.
- Are you happy?
- Oh, I'm delighted.
- Okay.
Have a nice day.
- You too.
- Hi, Jerry.
- Hi, Louise.
Hey.
Oh, well, thank you very much.
- For what?
- For putting my picture up on that wall.
I'm like Richard Dawson down there now.
Every person I see engages me in this long, boring, tedious conversation.
- I can't even get out of the building.
- You should be thanking me for liberating you from your world of loneliness and isolation.
- Now you're part of a family.
- Family?
- Yeah.
- You think I want another family?
My father's demanding my uncle pay interest on $50 he was supposed to give my mother in 1941 and my uncle put my Nana in a home to try and shut her up.
Another thing, Cosmo, Kramer, whatever you wanna be called the kissing thing is over.
There's no more kissing and I don't care what the consequences are.
Oh, hi, Mr. Costanza.
We were trying to get in touch with you.
Wendy can't make her appointment.
- What do you mean?
- She had some personal affairs she had to attend to.
I left a message on your machine.
You didn't get it?
- When did you leave the message?
- A few hours ago.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I require 24 hours' notice for a cancellation.
Now, as I see it, you owe me $75.
- Look, Mr. Costanza - Will that be cash or check?
I am really glad I took the day off.
Oh, yeah.
There's nothing better than skiing.
Yeah.
God, I hope my clients weren't too upset.
The hell with them.
What are you stopping here for?
I'm dropping you off.
- Oh, no.
I'm three more blocks.
- If I take you right to your door I have to go all the way around Central Park West, back to Columbus.
You know, it's all one-way.
Yeah, but it's only three blocks.
Right.
It's only three blocks.
All right.
Well.
I got it.
She'd driven me 120 miles, then all of a sudden three blocks from my door, she decides this trip is over.
- Isn't that strange?
- Yes, it's very strange, very strange.
I've never heard of anything like this.
It's as if I was hitchhiking and she said, "This is as far as I can take you.
" If you were, you'd never get in a car with someone with a hairdo like that.
I had to carry my skis and my boots and my poles.
- I pinched a nerve in my shoulder.
- You should have her work on it.
Yeah.
All right.
I gotta go.
- Hi, Jerry.
- Hi, Mary.
Listen, I've decided I can't kiss hello anymore.
I'm sorry.
It's nothing personal.
It makes me uncomfortable.
I'm sorry.
- Hi, Jerry.
- Hi, Louise.
I was just telling Mary how I'm not gonna do the kiss-hello thing anymore.
I'm sorry.
I just can't do it.
It's nothing personal.
It's just that I'm not really able to do it.
Thank you for your cooperation.
- Hello.
- Jerry?
Hi, Mom.
What's happening with Uncle Leo?
Is he paying you?
Well, he said no.
He says we have no proof.
No proof?
We'll get him.
He's a crook.
Sooner or later he'll slip up.
Anyway, I want you to go check on Nana at the home.
- Okay, I will.
- Do you realize an above average performing growth mutual fund for 53 years - What's up?
- I gotta go visit my nana in the home.
Hey, Kramer.
Look at this.
Look at my picture.
I've been defaced.
Well, don't you worry, buddy.
I made double prints.
- Hey.
Hi, Cosmo.
- Oh, hey.
Jack.
How you doing?
Hi, Jack.
I was wondering, could you get to that shower today, you think?
Oh, I see.
When you need something done, then you're friendly to people.
- No, no.
That's not true.
- Well, I think it is.
It's a big building, Seinfeld.
Maybe I'll get to it someday after I take care of the people that are civil to each other.
Yeah, she's upstairs playing cards.
She really doesn't belong here.
My uncle put her here because he's trying to prove he doesn't owe my mother $50.
Well, she seems very happy.
She met an old friend who used to live next door to her.
- Buddy?
- Yes, that's his name.
He's right over there.
I'm sorry.
I don't owe you anything.
I had some personal business that day.
Oh, I see.
So your time is more valuable than mine.
Is that it?
You're a delicate genius.
A delicate genius?
- Elaine.
- George.
Good luck.
- What's going on?
- Wendy I injured my shoulder Wednesday when you dropped me off and I had to carry my skis and my boots and my poles all the way home.
I'm having trouble lifting my arm.
You think you could give me some treatment?
Oh, sure.
You have insurance, right?
Insurance?
You're charging me?
Wednesday?
That's your personal business?
Skiing?
Sure.
Let people suffer while you're shooshing all over a mountain.
- How did you hear that?
- I hear everything.
All right, why don't you two just take your business elsewhere.
That is a good idea.
- Come on, George.
- Yeah.
Let's go.
And you know, you might wanna do something about that hair.
Why?
What's wrong with my hair?
I think it's a little old-fashioned, don't you?
- Tell her.
- She's right.
So you were with him at the track?
Oh, yeah.
He won $1000.
His son was there too.
- Leo?
- Yeah, that's it.
Leo.
Oh, what an obnoxious little kid.
He used to steal my soda bottles and cash them in for the deposit.
Is that so?
After your grandfather hit the daily double, he gave him $100 and told him to give $50 to his sister.
His sister?
Well, I said he should give it to me for all the bottles he took.
Well, that's very interesting.
Uncle Leo I just met an old acquaintance of yours.
You remember Buddy.
He just told me quite a story about you and Grandpa at the track.
- Wait a second.
- You're busted.
Hey, Steve.
How you doing?
Hey, Jeff.
What's happening?
Mary.
Oh, Mary.
Give us a kiss.
Don't be like that.
I made a mistake.
Look, why don't you do everybody a favor and just get out of this building.
Nobody wants you here.
Nobody!
- Hi, Mary.
- Oh, hi, Jeff.
How are you?
Hi, Steve.
How are you?
- Hey, let's go get some coffee.
- Great idea.
I gotta go down to the corner, but Oh, Paul, could you hold that door?
- Hi.
- Hey, could I use your shower?
What, again?
You took one this morning.
I got a date.
Come on.
Please.
I know, but, you know, I got a little problem.
- Wendy here?
- No, no.
She changed her hairstyle.
It's terrible.
No, we're done.
- I'll go get some more beer.
- Oh, yeah.
Great.
And get some of those blue corn chips.
- Hey.
- Hi, Cosmo.
Hi.
I like that.
- Who was that?
- That was Stephanie, 2G.
Oh, man.
- You got quite a few people in here.
- Well, I'd invite you in but, you know.
Oh, I understand.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Remember the doorman strike?
They have a union, in the fancy buildings and they went on strike.
You would think if any group of people would not wanna demonstrate what life would be like without them, it would be doormen.
"Let's see how they do without us.
" There's no doorman, people open the door, they walk in.
Who's gonna walk out next?
The guys that clean your windshield at the traffic light with the dirty rag?
"We demand shorter yellows and longer reds.
" - May I help you?
- Yeah.
I'm just going up to see Elaine Benes.
Benes.
There's no one here by that name.
Oh, she's housesitting for Mr. Pitt.
- Oh, housesitting?
- Yeah.
What are you, the boyfriend?
Here for a quickie?
- Can I just go up?
- Oh, I get it.
Why waste time making small talk with the doorman?
I should just shut up and do my job opening the door for you.
How about those Knicks?
Oh, I see, on the sports page.
Why do you think I wasn't reading the Wall Street page?
Oh, I know.
Because I'm the uneducated doorman.
So you think your parents will get back together?
I hope so.
I can't take him living with me much longer.
He makes this kasha, it stinks up the whole house.
- Hey, George, stick them up.
- What?
For these German tourists.
Pretend that I'm robbing you.
- Why?
- So these people can go back home and tell their friends they saw a real New York mugging.
It'll give them a thrill.
All right, hands up, porky.
That's it.
Now, give me your wallet.
You got it in here, huh, fat boy?
Is that all you got, huh?
Is that all you got?
- All right, that's enough.
- I'll tell you when it's enough.
All right, you better not say anything or I'll stalk you.
Where have you been?
We're gonna miss the movie.
Let's go.
I am not going back down there.
I can't face that guy again.
- What guy?
- The doorman.
I don't wanna play any more of his mind games.
- What time does he get off?
- Six.
But then the night doorman comes on.
He's much scarier.
Well, it's almost 6 now.
Can't we just wait till he goes home?
- We'll still make the movie.
- Okay, okay.
So, what did you do today, Dad?
Today I went record shopping in Greenwich Village.
I bought this record, but I can't seem to find the hi-fi.
I don't have a hi-fi.
- I gave you my old record player.
- I gave it to Cosmo.
Cosmo?
Who's Cosmo?
I'm Cosmo.
Well, I want it back.
I want to listen to that cha-cha record.
One, two, cha-cha-cha.
All right, all right.
Can we go out and eat?
Let me change my shirt.
Jerry, it's 6, let's go.
That doorman's still milling around outside.
He's very peculiar.
- No, don't - Hello.
- Oh, hi, Mr. Pitt.
- Give that to me.
Hello, Mr. Pitt.
How's Scotland?
Elaine, are you having a party?
A party?
Oh, no, that was just my stupid friend, Jerry.
He just left.
We can go.
There's to be no entertaining while I'm gone.
Believe me, we're not entertained.
We're just leaving.
- Grab those empty bottles for me.
- I need to know what's in the mail.
Oh, well, Mr. Pitt, there's really nothing that can't wait.
- We're trying to catch a movie.
- Well, catch the later show.
I need to know what's in the mail.
All right.
I can't go.
The new TIME magazine.
- The new People.
- Oh, who's on the cover?
Hey, buddy.
You?
What are you doing here?
You work at this building too?
Oh, sure.
Poor doorman has to work two jobs to put food on the table for mother and baby.
No, I live here.
That's okay, isn't it?
So you work all day as a doorman at one building and then you stand outside your building?
Yeah.
You got a problem with that?
Look, I'm not going in your building.
I really don't have to talk to you.
Goodbye.
You really think you're better than me, don't you?
So my father opened his shirt - Yeah, and?
- Tell him, Kramer.
He had breasts.
- What do you mean, breasts?
- Big breasts.
So what?
A lot of older men have that.
No, not these.
These were real hooters.
I was throwing up all night.
It was like my own personal Crying Game.
You know, maybe you're gonna get them too, George.
Yeah, that's right.
What if it's a genetic thing?
Like father, like son.
But your father's not bald.
No, no.
That skips a generation.
The baldness gene comes from your grandfather.
Then I suppose the bosom gene comes from your grandmother?
Frank can't be too comfortable with those things clanging around.
He should wear something for support.
- You mean, like a bra?
- No, a bra is for ladies.
I'm talking about a support undergarment specifically designed for men.
Boy, that brain never stops working, does it?
That's right.
I'm gonna go noodle with this.
Hey, we're twins.
What?
!
Our shirts, they're the same.
Imagine that.
What?
What did you say to the doorman?
What?
Nothing.
He claims that you followed him home and started harassing him.
What, does this guy got a personal vendetta with me?
What did I do to him?
Because I asked him about the Knicks?
- Hey, did you make the movie?
- No.
You wanna go tonight?
You can pick me up.
All right.
Can we go to a later show so he's off his shift when I come by?
So now we have to rearrange our lives to avoid the doorman?
Yes, we do.
What is wrong with George?
He's trying to get something off his chest.
All right.
I gotta try and talk my mother into taking him off my hands.
Help you?
What are you doing here?
You're supposed to be gone.
I traded shifts with the night doorman.
He had personal affairs to attend to.
My fellow doormen and I watch out for each other.
We don't stab each other in the back like people in your world.
Look, I don't want any trouble.
I don't have a doorman in my building.
I guess I'm not used to talking to them.
- I'd really just like to be friends.
- You wanna be friends?
I'd like to be.
- Then watch the door for a minute.
- What?
I just want to get a beer.
Be back in a minute.
- Wait a second.
What do I do?
- It's not brain surgery.
Open the door for people.
If they don't live here, don't let them in.
Here.
Wear this.
Hey, hey, wait a second.
Hey!
Hello!
- Wait a second, you live here?
- Of course I live here.
I've lived here for 20 years.
Now, if you don't let me in I'm going to call the police and have you arrested.
All right.
All right.
You think you're better than me?
- You gotta sign for it.
- Oh, right, right.
Hey, how about those Knicks, huh?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hey, I brought back your record player.
Oh, thank you, Kramer.
Put it over there.
Oh, boy.
Yeah.
- So how you feeling?
- A little tired.
- Does your back hurt?
- How did you know?
Well, it's obvious.
You're carrying a lot of extra baggage up there.
- Up here?
- Oh, yeah, top floor.
Listen, Frank you ever considered wearing something for support?
Now, look at this.
Mind you, this is just a prototype.
- You want me to wear a bra?
- No, no.
A bra is for ladies.
Meet the Bro.
So is your father excited about coming home?
George.
Hey, Mom, what kind of woman was Grandma?
All of a sudden you're interested in your grandmother?
Well, you know, you get to a certain point you want to know about your roots.
- Well, she was a lovely woman.
- Yeah.
- What about physically?
- Physically?
- You know, what did she look like?
- Well, you've seen pictures.
Well, you can't tell much from those pictures.
Tell what?
Was she..
?
- Was she a big woman?
- Big?
No.
She was my height.
- Bosomy?
- Bosomy?
You want to know if your grandmother was bosomy?
I was just wondering.
The information could be relevant.
Where do you get your genes from?
That's what I'd like to know.
- I can't believe you left your post.
- He left me there.
You see the mind games?
Hey, what's going on here?
Somebody stole the couch out of the lobby.
Where's the doorman?
How come someone wasn't watching the door?
- Jerry, let's get out of here.
- Yeah.
Oh, my God.
- Why were you watching the door?
- He asked me to.
We were getting along.
You know, my fingerprints are all over this.
That doorman knows you're a friend of mine.
He'll tell that co-op lady.
She'll tell Mr. Pitt.
Jerry, I'm in this too deep.
Don't you find it odd that as soon as he leaves, a couch gets stolen?
- Maybe he's setting me up.
- All right.
Shut up.
Just let me think.
I gotta think.
We gotta get our story straight.
- All right.
What if we say..
?
- All right.
Here it is.
This is what we'll tell them.
- You came to pick me up.
- I came to pick you up.
- Yeah, that's what I said.
- No, I was just - No, I know.
It's not helping.
- All right.
Well, just start again.
- Okay.
You came to pick me up - Right.
- You see?
Again.
- What?
I said, "Right.
" All right, you came right upstairs without talking to the doorman.
But the doorman's gonna say I was there.
So what?
No one's gonna believe a doorman.
- I don't know if this is gonna work.
- Stick with the story.
We'll be fine.
- Let me do the talking.
- Okay.
Good.
Now fix me a drink.
How's that feel?
- This feels very comfortable.
- You see?
- I feel 10 years younger.
- And your posture's a lot better.
Look at you.
- And I can breathe easier too.
- I told you.
Frank, listen, here's what I'm thinking.
- You have a friend in the bra business.
- Of course.
Sid Farkus.
He's the best in the business.
It's our chance.
What do you say?
It'll be me, you and the Bro, bro.
Let's do it.
Except we gotta do something about the name.
- Why?
What's wrong with Bro?
- Bro is no good.
Too ethnic.
- You got something better?
- How about the The Mansiere.
- Mansiere?
- That's right.
A brassiere for a man.
The Mansiere.
Get it?
Well, you scared her off.
We may never see Mom again.
Hey, George, what do you like better, the Bro or the Mansiere?
Dad, we need to talk.
I had to use the bathroom so I asked this guy to watch the door for a few minutes.
Why should I believe you?
Actually, it was her friend.
I was just speaking to the doorman here about the couch robbery.
Oh, really?
The doorman.
And pray tell, what did the doorman say?
He said he asked a friend of yours to watch the door.
Oh, my.
Well, the doorman certainly has a wild imagination, doesn't he?
Well, what do we have here?
Perhaps Ms. Benes can explain why a Jerry Seinfeld signed for this package at the exact same time the couch was stolen.
He'd never watched a door before, Mrs. Payton.
He didn't know how to do it.
You know, he's a comedian, Mrs. Payton.
They don't know how to do anything.
Don't you see what's going on here?
He set us up.
He's playing all these mind games.
- They're saying I'm responsible?
- There was nothing I could do.
He had a Federal Express slip with your signature on it.
Diabolical.
He thought of everything.
He was setting me up from day one.
Is it possible we were victims of a sting?
I'm sure he's having a good laugh over this with his doorman buddies.
So you didn't even want the couch?
No, I was just messing with his head.
And they think they're better than us.
Anyway, Jerry Jerry.
- We have to replace the couch.
- Now we have to buy a new couch?
Not necessarily.
Why don't you take back the couch you gave me?
- The one with the Poppie stain?
- Yeah, sure.
Then my father will have no place to sleep.
He's gotta move out.
But it's got a pee stain on it.
Well, the cushion's turned over.
- I guess.
- Yeah.
You get a couch, I get rid of my father.
It couldn't be more perfect.
- Now, it's call the Bro.
- Or the Mansiere.
- Yeah, but I prefer the Bro.
- I like Mansiere.
Well, I have to tell you, it's a very interesting idea.
You know, selling bras exclusively to women we're really only utilizing - That's what we figured.
- I told you.
And to be perfectly frank, I've always felt I could use some support.
I know when I'm wearing Ban-Lon there appears to be some jiggling.
I wouldn't be caught dead in Ban-Lon.
So, what do you see in the back?
Hooks?
Velcro?
- Definitely Velcro.
- Oh, yeah.
Say you're getting intimate with a woman you don't want her fumbling and struggling back there.
I think we've all experienced that.
Summer nights.
I still have to talk about this to Mr. De Granmont but barring any unforeseen developments gentlemen, I think we're sitting on a winner.
Good.
Frank, I wanna tell you how sorry I am to hear about you and Estelle separating.
Thank you, Sid, but that's all in the past.
I'm ready to move on.
I've always been very fond of Estelle.
Beautiful woman.
I hope you don't think this is out of line but would it be okay with you if I were to ask her out?
You want to go out with my wife?
Where do you get the nerve to ask me that?
No, I'm just saying I know what you're saying and thinking.
- No, Frank - Come on, Cosmo.
- I'm not doing business with this guy.
- Come on.
Frank.
Frank!
Frank!
- Jerry took the couch back.
- He took it back?
- Didn't you tell him I was using it?
- Oh, I pleaded with him.
Where do I sleep?
Well, I took the liberty of packing your things.
Mom's coming to get you.
I thought Jerry didn't want that couch because of the stain.
- What stain?
- Oh, you didn't notice?
It has a pee stain.
You had me sleeping on a pee-stained couch?
No.
No, no.
The cushion was turned over.
But the very idea.
You had me lying in urine!
There's Mom.
There's Mom.
- Is it safe to come in?
- Oh, of course.
Of course.
You're not having any of your transvestite parties?
Will you stop it?
I lived with him for 40 years.
I never saw him trying on my underwear.
As soon as he leaves the house, he turns into J. Edgar Hoover.
Here, Cosmo, you can have the hi-fi.
I don't need it now.
- I got one at home.
- All right.
Let's go.
- We'll go out for dinner tonight.
- I can't tonight.
I'm busy.
What do you mean, busy?
- I'm having dinner with someone.
- With whom?
Sid Farkus.
Sid Farkus?
You're not having dinner with a bra salesman.
Hey, he only sells them, he doesn't wear them.
Okay.
That's it.
I'm not coming home.
But you can't stay here.
There's no place to sleep.
We'll work something out.
Stop him!
Yeah, yeah, it's him.
Stop that man!
It's him!
Somebody stop him!
Please, quick.
Stop!
It's him!
I know.
I know.
Help!
Stop him!
Hey, that record player is not yours.
- No, look, somebody gave it to me.
- You're a thief.
We have proof.
What is that?
It's the first upper-body support undergarment specifically designed for men.
How does it connect in the back?
With a hook?
Oh, no, no, no.
Here.
Velcro.
Well, I suppose it will have to do.
- It's a beautiful couch.
- It's hardly been used.
Poppie.
Oh, hello, Jerry.
- What are you doing here?
- Visiting my friend.
- Hey, how you feeling?
- Much better.
Much better.
The doctors are saying I cannot have no aggravation so I sell the restaurant.
I just take it easy.
See, if I get excited, that's aggravated my condition.
The last time I got aggravated was in the restaurant with your friend.
She started a big fight about abortion.
It's you.
- It's you.
- What?
You I I I gotta sit down.
- No, Poppie, no!
- No, Poppie!
Kasha?
No, thanks, Dad.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Buying shoes is a challenge.
Ever see someone put on new shoes?
They turn into a zombie as they start walking around the store.
"Yeah, these are pretty good.
" Then they have that little 1-foot-high mirror.
What is that about?
So I can see what cats will think of my shoes?
What is that angle?
Bum passed out on the curb, "Hey, what do you think of these?
I just got them.
I've seen them from that angle myself.
" That guy was amazing.
He could dunk.
And he was my height.
- What was his name again?
- Jimmy.
- Jimmy.
Right.
- I don't know how you could forget.
He kept referring to himself in the third person.
"Jimmy's under the boards.
Jimmy's in the open.
Jimmy makes the shot.
" You're just mad because we beat you.
Jerry, it's my fault.
I couldn't make a shot.
These losses stay with me.
They fester, Jerry.
No, this is gonna plague me.
Hey, Jimmy.
- Great game.
- Oh, yeah.
Jimmy played pretty good.
Hey, you know, I felt like we had a synergy out there.
- We were really helping each other.
- What do you got there?
- These?
- Yeah.
These are Jimmy's training shoes.
Yeah, I've seen these things.
What, do they..
?
- They make your legs stronger?
- Oh, yeah.
Jimmy couldn't jump at all before he got these.
Jimmy was like you.
- They're plyometric.
- Plyometric?
Yeah, they isolate the muscles.
The muscle has to grow or die.
- Where do you get them?
- Jimmy sells them.
- You sell them?
- Oh, yeah.
But Jimmy's all out right now.
Moving to Manhattan set Jimmy back a bit.
Let me give you my card.
It's got my home number.
- I want to buy a pair next shipment.
- All right.
All right, Jimmy, good talking to you.
- Here you go.
- Jimmy will see you around.
Wait a minute, what day is today?
Oh, Tuesday.
Damn it, I shouldn't have worked out today.
Mr. Wilhelm called a big meeting.
I'm gonna be sweating through it.
- What?
You took a shower.
- It wouldn't take.
Ten minutes from now, I'll be sweating.
I can feel it.
- I'm a human heat pump.
- You ought to take cold showers.
Cold showers?
- They're for psychotics.
- Well, I take them.
They give me a whoosh.
- All right.
I'll see you guys later.
- All right.
- So, what, you heading home?
- No.
Got a dental appointment.
- Tim Whatley?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I got a checkup Thursday.
- How do you like that.
You really shouldn't brush I think that's "eat 24 hours before surgery.
" Oh, no, you gotta eat before surgery.
You need your strength.
I've called this meeting because we have a problem.
For the last few months someone has been stealing equipment from the club.
Until recently, it's been little things: Bases, batting helmets, doughnuts.
But two nights ago, they pulled a big one.
They took a pitching machine, a batting cage, the infield tarp and all of Mr. Steinbrenner's vitamins.
Now, we have reason to believe it's an inside job.
So if anybody here knows anything about it I recommend strongly that you come forward.
Dr. Whatley's running a little late.
Take a seat, I'll call you when he's ready.
All right.
Oh, okay.
Right.
Thanks, Mr. Pitt.
Okay.
Goodbye.
Hey, you wanna go see the Velvet Fog?
The Velvet Fog?
Yeah, Mel Tormé.
That's his nickname.
What the hell is a velvet fog?
- Do you wanna go or not?
- Well, where is it?
He's performing at this AMCA benefit.
- AMCA?
- Able Mentally Challenged Adults.
I can't watch a man sing a song.
What, are you crazy?
They get all emotional, they sway.
It's embarrassing.
Well, what am I gonna do for a date?
Do you know that blond guy who's always on the Exercycle at the health club?
- I don't think so.
- No, no, you know.
- He's really handsome, with those - Elaine, I really don't pay much attention to men's faces.
- You can't find beauty in a man?
- No.
I find them repugnant and unappealing.
- Hey.
- To wit.
What?
Elaine and I were discussing whether or not I could admit a man is attractive.
Oh, you know, I'll tell you who's an attractive man: George Will.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Yeah, he has a clean look.
Scrubbed and shampooed and He's smart.
No, no, I don't find him all that bright.
- So you got any cavities?
- Just one.
- Yeah?
- Gotta go back.
Oh, but get this.
- Elaine, you will appreciate this.
- What?
I'm sitting in Tim Whatley's waiting room he's got a Penthouse right out on the table.
- Penthouse?
- Yeah, what is that?
Isn't that sick?
I'd be embarrassed to have that in my apartment.
- So, what's wrong with that?
- He's a doctor.
I mean, it's supposed to be, like, a sterile environment.
So did you take a look?
Of course.
But that's got nothing to do with it.
Well, I'll tell you, I'm looking forward to my appointment on Thursday.
I might even get there a few minutes early.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Hey, listen, do either of you guys know that blond guy who's always on the Exercycle at the health club?
You know, he's just really handsome?
I I wouldn't know.
You know, just admitting a man is handsome doesn't necessarily make you a homosexual.
It doesn't help.
All right.
Never mind.
I'll see you.
Hey, you know those shoes that Jimmy had?
I cut a deal with him.
We're gonna import a case of them together.
- What for?
You got a job.
- There's a lot of money in this.
He's got a proven sales method.
- Yeah?
What's that?
- He jumps.
Jimmy's got a backer.
Jimmy's jumping for dollars.
Jimmy and George are gonna get rich.
Will you stop with the Jimmys?
- Hey, what is this?
- Kung Pao.
Hot.
Kung Pao!
Look at me.
Look at me.
Come on, I'm stretching right in front of you.
Hey, a smile.
We made contact.
All right.
One more stretch and then go talk to him.
You know Jimmy is pretty sweet on you.
- He is?
- Oh, yeah.
Jimmy's been watching you.
- You're just Jimmy's type.
- Oh, really?
Jimmy's new in town.
Jimmy doesn't really know anyone.
Oh, well, I'd like to get to know him.
Jimmy would like to get to know you.
You think Jimmy likes Mel Tormé?
Jimmy loves the Velvet Fog.
- Hey, Kramer.
- Well, you're looking sharp there, Tim.
Yeah, well, I do what I can.
- How have you been?
- Oh, fine, good, yeah.
I've just been occupying myself with some of your reading material.
- So, what'll it be?
Novocain?
- Yes.
Yes, indeed.
- Why don't we clear a path first.
- Let's do that.
- You remember Mr. Thirsty.
- All right.
- You too with these?
- Yeah, I'm onboard.
So, what did Tim say?
Well, he said I gotta cut out the Skittles.
- Looks like he gave you Novocain.
- Oh, I'm loaded.
What about the Penthouse?
You ask?
Well, he said that, you know it helps his patients relax a little bit.
And he's got a new policy: Adults only.
- Adults only?
- Yeah.
- What the hell is going on over there?
- Well, you know, it's great.
You know, no kids allowed.
You don't have to watch your language.
You find the need to use obscenities at the dentist?
When they pull that needle out, I let the expletives fly.
Hey, come on, watch it.
You're drooling on the floor.
How much Novocain did that guy give you?
I can't hold the water.
- Oh, yeah.
- Hey, Jimmy.
Jimmy's ready.
Jimmy's got some new moves.
- Go, Jimmy.
- Check Jimmy out.
Jimmy's down.
It's pretty bad, man.
Your boy's gonna be in traction.
Jimmy might have a compound fracture.
Jimmy's going into shock.
- Why weren't you more careful?
- Hey, I'm doing the best I can.
Why are you taking it so personally?
Because if he can't jump, there goes my sneaker business.
Well, I said I'm sorry.
Jimmy's gonna get you, Kramer.
Jimmy holds grudges.
Let Jimmy go.
You know, I can't feel anything.
Hey, taxi!
Taxi!
Okay.
Go ahead.
Go ahead.
You got it.
He's got it.
- Please, go ahead.
- No, no, you were here first.
No, please, I insist.
I'll grab the next one.
- Let's share.
We share, all right?
- Yes, let's.
That's a great idea.
My name is Arnold Deensfrei.
- What is your name?
- Cosmo Kramer.
It's nice to meet you.
Very nice to meet you, Cosmo.
Are you heading home?
Yeah, heading home.
Good for you.
You're really independent.
Well, you're not doing too bad yourself.
Anyway, Jimmy couldn't be here today so he asked me to fill in for him.
And I'm sure that you'll be impressed at what can be accomplished after only a few short days of training.
Here we go.
The Velvet Fog.
- What about the Velvet Fog?
- What about the Velvet Fog?
Well, he's singing at a benefit, and I'm gonna be sitting at his table.
- I'm going to that.
- Yeah, I'm a guest of honor.
What are you talking about?
Well, this afternoon I shared a cab with this Deensfrei.
Yeah, yeah, Arnold Deensfrei.
He runs the AMCA.
Well, okay.
That's the guy.
He's organizing the dinner.
I know that, but why are you going?
Well, because we hit it off, and he was very impressed with what I do.
What you do?
You don't do anything.
Well, apparently I do something because I'm sitting at the head table with Mr. Mel Tormé.
What are those?
Oh, these are my vertical-leap training shoes.
Wait a second.
Were you wearing those shoes in the cab?
Yeah, yeah.
Right after I left the Y. - Don't you see what happened?
- What?
He couldn't talk, he's wearing these shoes, he's drooling.
What?
He thinks you're mentally challenged.
Well you know.
- What happens when you show up?
He'll see that you're not.
- Not necessarily, because - I know, I know.
Cheryl, would you ready the nitrous oxide, please.
It's good.
Where is Jennifer today?
She's over at Dr. Seisman's office.
Yeah, we find it fun to swap now and then.
Now, you just take some deep breaths and try to relax.
Oh, man!
It's George.
Oh, Sports Wholesalers, yeah, yeah.
Thanks for calling me back.
No, I still got the shoes.
Still got shoes, lots of them.
Yeah, this is beautiful athletic gear.
I'm sorry, I gotta call you right back.
Yeah.
All right.
- Mr. Wilhelm.
- So, George have you heard anything about the missing equipment?
No, no.
Not a thing.
You know, George, there's nothing I hate more than a liar.
Well, there's no room for someone like that in this organization.
- Are you feeling all right, George?
- Yeah, fine.
You look a little warm.
It's the chicken.
You're a terrible liar, George.
Look at you.
You're a wreck.
- You're sweating bullets.
- It's the Kung Pao.
George likes his chicken spicy.
Maybe you were still under the gas.
Maybe you were hallucinating you were coming out of the gas but still under the gas.
- I don't think so.
I think they were getting dressed.
And not only that, my shirt was out.
- Your shirt was out?
- I think so.
- Well, what kind of shirt was it?
- You know, like a tennis shirt.
- You don't tuck those in.
- Sometimes I tuck, sometimes I don't.
- Well, were you tucked?
- I think I was tucked.
All right, say you were.
What do you think could have happened?
I don't know.
But I was spitting out and rinsing like there was no tomorrow.
Is this guy a dentist or Caligula?
- What are you getting?
- I don't think I'm hungry.
Okay, so you were violated by two people while you were under the gas.
So what?
You're single.
I'm damaged goods now.
Join the club.
You ever call that guy from the health club?
Oh, yeah, Jimmy.
Jimmy?
- That's the guy?
- Yeah.
I can't believe you're going out with him.
- Why?
- I don't know, he's so strange.
How so?
Didn't you notice he refers to himself in the third person?
"Jimmy can dunk.
Jimmy's new in town.
Jimmy will see you later.
" No, wait a minute.
That's not him.
That's the guy who gave me Jimmy's number.
That's Jimmy.
That's the way he talks.
I'm gonna go see Mel Tormé with him?
Jimmy's gonna put the moves on Elaine.
So I have to go see Steinbrenner later.
Wilhelm told him I was responsible for stealing all the merchandise.
Why?
Because when he questioned me, I was sweating from the Kung Pao.
I don't know how you could eat that spicy chicken.
George likes spicy chicken.
What's that?
I like spicy chicken.
No, no, you said, "George likes spicy chicken.
" - No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.
- "George likes spicy chicken.
" - You're turning into Jimmy.
George is getting upset.
So, what did you want to see Jimmy about?
Well, Jimmy, about tonight.
There's been a little misunderstanding.
Jimmy doesn't like misunderstandings.
Yeah, well, what happened was Jimmy and misunderstandings kind of clash.
You know, I've never heard anyone talk the way you do.
- It's very unusual.
- Well, Jimmy's very unusual.
Well, anyway, see, when I made the date, I thought that Jimmy Hey, look, Hank's got a new boyfriend.
Jimmy's not threatened by Hank's sexuality.
Jimmy's happy for Hank.
Elaine once tried to convert one but Elaine's not gonna go through that again.
I'm gonna go and try and find some candy.
- You want some?
- Yeah.
- What kind?
- I don't care.
- Hey, Jimmy.
- Hi, Elaine.
- Elaine got a new dress.
- Jimmy likes it.
There's no candy around here.
Hey, Jimmy.
Well, look who's here.
- That's the guy who sidelined Jimmy.
- What?
That guy took the bread out of Jimmy's mouth.
Jimmy's out of work because of you.
- Jimmy wants a piece of Kramer!
- Come on, now.
Get your hands off Jimmy!
Jimmy's gonna get you, Kramer!
Hands off Jimmy!
Don't touch Jimmy!
Let go of Jimmy!
Yeah, I Is my lip swollen?
Guy's got a problem.
No, no, I've been living alone a long time now.
Well, I think that's the tops.
You wanted to see me, Mr. Steinbrenner?
Yes, George, come in, come in.
I've been your biggest supporter and I was disappointed to hear you've been pilfering equipment.
George would never do anything like that.
- No, why would I?
I own it.
- Right.
So, what are you saying?
Why would George steal from the Yankees?
- He wouldn't.
- Of course not.
Exactly.
I don't know what the hell is going on here.
- Sir?
- Nothing.
Well, I was thinking it's time for George's lunch.
Yes, it is.
All right.
Let's see, what do I have today?
Oh, darn it.
It's ham and cheese again.
And she forgot the fancy mustard.
I told her I like that fancy mustard.
You could put that mustard on a shoe and it would taste pretty good to me.
She made up for it with a cupcake.
I got a new system of eating these.
I used to peel off the chocolate.
Now I eat the cake first and save the frosting for the end.
It's almost a dessert dessert.
Ladies and gentlemen I wanna dedicate this song to a very courageous young man.
Hey, got the new Penthouse.
- Where's my Mr. Goodbar?
- Yeah, here you are.
Oh, here, here.
Listen.
"Dear Penthouse: I'd like to tell you about an experience I recently had.
As an avid reader, I've always wondered if the letters are true.
- If the letters are true.
I'm a dentist, and one afternoon, my hygienist and I decided to have a little fun with one of our patients.
Of course, none of our patients had any idea exactly what we were up to.
I was still wondering whether or not the tools I could use "
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
These pest-control companies call themselves exterminators, but they can't really do it.
The best they can do is get the bugs to go to somebody else's house.
They just relocate them.
You know what I mean?
They're bug realtors is what they are.
"I think you'll be happy here.
There's a lot of crumbs, not much light.
They usually sleep through the night, so you'll have your run of the place.
" Nobody cares about killing insects.
Even animal-rights people don't care.
You could probably walk into an animal-rights meeting and hear a speech like: "The only way to stop the cruelty of the scientific testing on animals Got him.
- is to boycott these companies.
" Anyway, it's funny.
Paula and I actually met because of Elaine.
Elaine is in my drawing class.
- And I went there one day to see - A nude model.
- if Elaine wanted to go get some coffee.
You know, I once went out with a nude model.
Never let me see her naked.
Hundreds of people see her naked every week except me.
Needless to say, it was quite vexing.
- Are you through?
- Yeah.
So I started to compliment Elaine on her sketches and it turns out they're Paula's.
George, I just like to doodle.
Dropped my napkin.
- Jerry.
- What?
- What are you doing?
- What?
She had those nuts in her mouth.
She just spit them out.
You You ate these?
You sucked on these and then put them on the plate?
Well, I didn't know you were gonna eat them.
Still.
I'm sorry you find me so repulsive.
No, no, I don't.
I mean, don't be silly.
- Yeah.
- It's just Well, if you'll excuse me, I think I'll just go to the ladies' room.
I'll join you.
Oh, man, did you see that?
I ate discarded food.
- Well, I've done that.
- Yeah, but with you it's intentional.
- Haven't you kissed her?
- But this is different.
This is like semi-digested foodstuff.
The next stop is the stomach, and you can take it from there.
Oh, excuse me.
Just a second.
Yeah, that's it.
Yeah, that's gonna make a big difference.
Hey, this is dating.
You can't leave anything to chance.
You think Shelly's upset that I made a big deal about the pecan?
Yeah.
- Thanks.
- No problem.
Well, Jerry, I guess we should get going.
Oh, boy.
Well, it was very nice meeting you, Shelly.
And, Jerry, be careful, there's a lot of nuts out there.
Do you have everything?
- Can you grab my purse?
- Yeah.
Yeah, so?
- Don't you see what this is?
- It's a doodle.
Yeah.
A doodle of me.
Look at the size of the nose, the ears.
All my features are distorted.
Oh, it's an affectionate caricature.
I'm grotesque.
- I look like a troll.
- It's just a drawing.
Don't you see what this says?
How could you possibly like somebody if you think they look like this?
Hello!
- What is with him?
- Usual.
So you know what?
My friend Judy recommended me for a job at Viking Press.
- Hey, good for you.
- Yeah, but get this: Viking has a deal with the Plaza Hotel.
They've got a two-bedroom suite there for out-of-town clients.
- So guess what I did?
- Oh, come on.
You told them you were from out of town just to stay in the hotel?
I know.
I know, Jerry, but it's the Plaza.
I've never stayed there.
It'll be like a vacation.
Be sure to catch a Broadway show while you're in town.
Listen, I used your parents' address in Florida.
They're coming into town tomorrow, by the way.
- Hey, what's this?
- Don't ask.
What, is it a drawing of Mr. Magoo?
No, it's George.
It is.
Are you enjoying yourself?
- I'm sorry.
- You see?
You see?
Listen, when is your next drawing class?
Tomorrow.
- I want you to do me a favor.
- What?
I want you to find out if she likes me.
Find out if she likes you?
What, are you in high school?
George, come on.
Can't you just, like, talk to her yourself?
Then she's gonna know that I like her more than she likes me.
My parents are coming, and I've gotta clean up.
So if you and Potsie are done scheming Well, they're in.
- What's in?
- The Mackinaw peaches, Jerry.
The Mackinaw peaches!
Right, the ones from Oregon that are only ripe for two weeks a year?
Yeah, that's right.
I split a case with Newman.
I wait all year for these.
Oh, this is fantastic.
Makes your taste buds come alive.
It's like having a circus in your mouth.
- Take a taste.
- No.
- Take a taste.
- I don't want it.
- Come on, just take a taste.
- I don't want it!
I'm not gonna taste your peach.
I ate someone's pecan last night.
I'm not eating your peach.
Jerry, this is a miracle of nature that exists for a brief period.
It's like the aurora borealis.
- Holy cow, what is this?
- What?
- I think I got flea bites.
- Flea bites?
Yeah.
Look at this.
My ankle's all bitten up.
You got a dog?
No.
Well, that is strange.
How can I have fleas?
Don't sweat it, buddy.
I used to have fleas.
- What did you do about them?
- What do you mean?
- Hey, Jerry.
How you doing?
- Hey!
- Kramer.
- Hi, Jerry.
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.
Jerry, I'm your mother.
Now, what is it?
Mom, Dad I have fleas.
Paula, I hear you've been going out with George Costanza.
- How did you know?
- Everybody knows.
George told me he thinks you're totally cute and everything.
He said that?
- Do you like George?
- Yeah.
He's cool.
No, I mean, do you like him or do you "like him" like him?
"Like" like.
Looks aren't that important to me, you know?
Ms. Benes, are you chewing gum?
Yep.
They're in your bedroom too, Mr. Seinfeld.
You got a full-blown outbreak of fleas on your hands.
I don't get it.
How did this happen?
I don't have a dog.
I don't explain them, Mr. Seinfeld.
I just exterminate them.
I don't understand this.
I'm gonna have to seal the place up for 48 hours and fog it.
Only way to get rid of them.
Nobody can be in here for 48 hours?
I got my parents in town.
Well, unless you wanna kill them they can't stay in here.
This stuff is pretty toxic.
- I'll go get my stuff.
It's in the truck.
- Okay.
- How you doing?
- Hi.
Bug guy.
- Why do you have a bug guy?
- I have fleas.
Fleas?
- How did you get fleas?
- I don't know.
Everyone's gotta clear the apartment for two days.
I don't know what to do with my parents.
They'll never let me pay for a hotel.
If they go someplace on their own, it'll be some awful dump.
Have you checked into the Plaza yet?
No.
Oh, no.
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Oh, no, no, no.
- My parents, my parents.
- No, no, no Okay!
Good.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Come up.
What about you?
Where are you gonna stay?
I'm gonna ask Shelly, but she still might be upset about the masticated pecan incident.
Hey, I found out from Paula, she likes George.
- I bet he'll be relieved.
- When he's dead, he'll be relieved.
By the way, Viking Press sent a FedEx for you to my parents.
They brought it with them.
Yeah, that's just some stuff about the company.
- Hey, did you talk to Paula?
- Yeah.
- So, what did she say?
- She likes you.
She said she liked me?
- She said that?
- Yep.
Those were her exact words, "I like George"?
Yep.
How do you like that?
How do you like that?
You see, I get myself into a tizzy, I'm all worked up, and for what?
For nothing.
In fact, she said looks weren't that important.
You see What?
She said..
?
She said looks aren't that important to her?
- Let me rephrase that.
She - She thinks I'm ugly.
I knew it.
See, the thing of it is there's a lot of ugly people out there walking around but they don't know they're ugly because nobody actually tells them.
So, what's your point?
- I don't I don't know.
- Okay.
The point, George, is she likes you.
Oh, so what?
I'd rather she hate me and thought I was good-looking.
Then at least I could get somebody else.
- What is this?
Why am I itching?
- That would be the fleas.
- Hey.
- Hey, how do you like this?
Oh, my God.
Morty, let's go.
This is too nice.
Hey, this is the kind of room Sinatra stays in.
Hey, look, macadamia nuts.
- Macadamia nuts?
- Yeah.
You know what these cost?
They're like 80 cents a nut.
- Are you sure this is all right?
- Yeah.
It's all taken care of.
Hey, they got a phone in the john here.
Judy.
- Hey.
- Hi.
Thank you for recommending me to Viking Press.
It is my pleasure.
Just make sure you give that manuscript a good read.
Manuscript?
Yeah, I'm sure they FedExed you a manuscript.
They want to see you read an unpublished work and give insightful criticism.
Read it twice if you have to.
- This is a big step in your career.
- Yeah, I gotta go.
- Hey, what about lunch?
- I gotta go.
- Thank God I found you.
- Oh, hey.
Do you still have that FedEx?
In the apartment.
But we can't go in.
It's being fumigated.
I'll take my chances.
Come on, come on.
- You see?
- Jerry, I need that FedEx right now.
I told you to take it.
I didn't know that it was a manuscript that I had to read.
Well, you can't go in there.
It's like a gas chamber in there.
Hey, buddy.
I left a Mackinaw peach in your refrigerator.
Kramer, they're fumigating.
There's toxic gas in there.
- Toxic gas?
- Oh, you'll be fine.
- You were there a couple minutes?
- An hour and a half.
I was reading a manuscript.
I just couldn't put it down.
- My manuscript?
- How do you feel?
Well, now that you mention it, a little woozy.
You've gotta go back in and grab my manuscript.
- I'm not going back.
- All right, then where is it?
I left it on the coffee table or something.
- What are you doing?
- I'm going in.
Didn't you see the sign on the door?
I thought it was so your parents wouldn't walk in while you were with a girl.
It's not on any table, Kramer.
Where is it?
I don't know.
I was in the bathroom, the kitchen.
Okay, bathroom, kitchen.
Could you get me a soda?
Jerry, I had some milk.
I made a sandwich.
I gotta get out of the building.
I couldn't find it anywhere.
- How did you get fleas anyway?
- I don't know.
Who could have been in my apartment?
I looked everywhere but all I could find were these stupid Chunky wrappers.
Wait a second.
Did you say Chunky wrappers?
- Yeah.
- Let me see those.
Oh, I know the chunky that left these Chunkys.
Newman!
I've got him.
Newman!
Open the door, Newman.
I know you're in there.
Hello, Jerry.
What a pleasant surprise.
There's nothing pleasant about it.
Just cut the crap.
You gave me fleas.
I know it and you know it.
Fleas?
That's preposterous.
How could I give you fleas?
- Now, if you don't mind - Oh, but I do.
There's probably fleas crawling all over your little snack bar.
So you have fleas.
Maybe you keep your house in a state of disrepair.
Maybe you live in squalor.
You know, Newman, the thing about fleas is that they irritate the skin.
And they start to itch.
Oh, maybe you can hold out five seconds or 10.
Maybe 15 or 20.
But after a while no matter how much willpower a person may have it won't matter because they're crawling, crawling on your skin.
Up your legs, up your spine, up your back All right, I've got them!
I'm rife with fleas!
Oh, that feels good.
Hey, this guy charges but I'm telling you, he's worth every penny.
I'm next.
Hey, Leo, get this.
I'm watching four movies at once.
Pay-per-view.
I love these nuts.
This champagne's gone flat.
Nana.
Let the chambermaid clean it up.
- Hello.
- What's the matter?
- Well, I spoke to Elaine - Hey, look, no shave.
No.
Why should that make any difference to you?
It doesn't.
Of course not.
You don't care what I look like.
That's right, I don't.
I suppose I could pull this out and walk around like this and you wouldn't care.
Not a whit.
I suppose we could go to Lincoln Center and I could wear sneakers and jeans.
- You could wear sweatpants.
- I could?
You could drape yourself in velvet for all I care.
Velvet?
- Did you read the whole thing?
- Oh, yeah.
Yeah?
So, what's it about?
Well, it's a story about love, deception, greed, lust and unbridled enthusiasm.
Unbridled enthusiasm?
That's what led to Billy Mumphrey's downfall.
Oh, boy.
You see, Elaine, Billy was a simple country boy you might say a cockeyed optimist who got himself mixed up in the high-stakes game of world diplomacy and international intrigue.
- Oh, my God.
- Well, here we go.
Could I have a Scotch on the rocks?
- May I?
- Yeah, go ahead.
All right.
What is this?
- What?
What are you..
?
- I can't taste this.
- What are you talking about?
- Well, this food, it has no taste.
Nothing.
I'm getting nothing.
What?
It must be the toxic gas from the fumigation.
What?
- Thanks for letting me stay here.
- I don't keep pecans in the house so I didn't think there would be a problem.
Oh, damn.
- What's the matter?
- I forgot my toothbrush.
Oh, no problem.
You can use mine.
Yours?
You know what?
I'll brush later.
Brush now.
Sure.
Newman, let me have a bite of your Mackinaw.
- What for, you got your own.
- Come on, I need to taste it.
Yeah.
Nothing.
I can't even taste a Mackinaw.
- Well, that's a shame.
- Wait all year, and I can't taste them.
You can't taste them, why waste them?
Why not give them all to me?
It's a story about love, deception greed, lust and unbridled enthusiasm.
Unbridled enthusiasm?
Yeah, yeah.
That's right.
That's what led to Billy Mumphrey's downfall.
Interesting take.
So you believe that had he not been so enthusiastic he could have averted disaster.
Yes.
Yes, that's right.
You see You see, Billy Mumphrey was a simple country boy some might say a cockeyed optimist who got caught up in the dirty game of world diplomacy and international intrigue.
So it was more a question of attitude than politics.
Yes.
Yes, Mr. Mandel.
Hey, Under Siege is on again.
Who's up for it?
No more nuts.
Oh, my God.
What the hell is this?
Don't tell me.
Velvet?
It's the real deal.
She's seen you in this thing?
That's right.
We just had sex.
You know, Jerry, I've been searching for someone a long time.
Well, the search is over.
And now the search for the right psychiatrist begins.
So, what's with the suitcase?
She threw me out.
- Why?
- I wouldn't use her toothbrush.
- So where you staying?
- I guess I'm stuck with the Velvet Fog.
Three hours of massage time, including several adult features five shoeshines and $400 worth of snacks.
Not to mention the damage to the room.
Mr. Mandel, you don't understand.
My friend had fleas.
I ran into the gas.
It could have killed me.
My other friend couldn't taste his peaches.
They're only good for two weeks.
I think you've read one too many Billy Mumphrey stories.
- Good day, Ms. Benes.
- Okay, good day.
- Hi, George.
- Hi.
This is fantastic.
- Ever had a Mackinaw peach?
- Oh, yeah.
I love those.
Well, too bad.
It's all done.
Yes.
Yes, it's back.
I can taste again.
- What's the date?
- Fifteenth.
Fifteenth.
Yes!
Last day for the Mackinaws.
I can still make it.
Wait, Newman.
Newman, wait.
Sorry.
Last one.
But if you want to suck the pit Look, Beauford.
It's the mailman.
You remember the mailman, don't you?
- Kramer, don't.
- Get him!
Hello?
Is anybody here..
?
They said they were sending over an Asian woman.
Oh, my God.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
The worst part about a car breaking down is you're a guy.
Because now you have to get out and pretend like you know what you're doing.
You gotta go, "All right, honey, I'm gonna go check it out.
" Walk around the front, open up the hood.
That's good, it obscures her view.
That's the main reason you want to do that.
You're looking in there, hoping you're going to see something in there so simple, so obvious, so incredibly easy to fix even you can handle it.
Like a giant onIoff switch turned off.
So you're going out with David Puddy.
Yeah.
What, is that a problem?
I think he could've asked me.
He's supposed to be a friend mine.
I guess he figured you wouldn't care.
It has been a few years.
Elaine, you always care who an ex-girlfriend dates.
You don't want someone you know and you don't want someone better than you.
Now, even though the latter is obviously impossible - Oh, God.
the former still applies.
I don't know, I just can't see you with a mechanic.
Oh, yeah, right, right.
All those mechanics do is work all day with their hands and their big muscular arms on machines, and then they come home dripping with animal sexuality like Stanley Kowalski.
- What a huge turnoff that is.
- All right.
Hey, look at that.
They got lobster on the menu.
Who would order a lobster here?
I mean, do they bring a lobster in every day hoping, "Today's the day.
" So what if they have a lobster?
Suddenly you're a shellfish connoisseur?
I think we really need to be in front of a television set.
You take TV out of this relationship, it is just torture.
So I'm getting an eye job.
An eye job?
Ma, you don't need an eye job.
- Georgie, I'm a divorcée.
- You're not a divorcée.
You're just separated.
You're a "separatée.
" - Well, I'm out there, George.
- You're not out there.
- I am too.
- You're not out there.
You can't be, because I am out there.
And if I see you out there there's not enough voltage in this world to electroshock me back into coherence.
Well, anyway, the operation is on Tuesday and I need you to drive me home because I'll be all drugged up.
Tuesday?
I can't do Tuesday.
Steinbrenner needs me This is the only time the doctor had.
- Kramer, hey!
Come on over here.
- I gotta go somewhere.
No, you're gonna sit down, you son of a gun.
All right, I'm sitting down.
How are you?
So, Kramer, I'm getting an eye job.
Yeah, good for you.
You have to look your best.
You're out there now.
She's not out there.
- So who's your doctor?
- Bakersaul.
He's good.
He's very good.
He worked on this kid from Guatemala with no nose turned him into Ricardo Montalban.
Hey, Kramer, what are you doing Tuesday?
Tuesday?
Why doesn't he pick you up after the operation?
He's got the car with the seats you like.
- I don't care.
- Yeah, I know.
But I can't drive anybody anywhere until I go down to get my new plates.
- Well, giddyup.
- All right.
I'm here to pick up my new plates.
My name is Kramer.
Cosmo Kramer.
Kramer.
- All right.
- All right.
- Sign right here, please.
- Okay.
Alrighty.
Thanks.
No, these don't belong to me.
I'm not the Assman.
I think there's been a mistake.
- What's your name again?
- Cosmo Kramer.
Cosmo Kramer.
You are the Assman.
No, I'm not the Assman.
Well, as far as the state of New York is concerned, you are.
How do you feel?
Fine.
Something the matter?
No.
Then what is it?
No, nothing.
Hey.
- I was with David Puddy last night.
- Yeah, so?
He did the move.
- What move?
- You know, the move.
Wait a second, my move?
David Puddy used my move?
- Yes, Yes.
- Are you sure?
Jerry, there is no confusing that move with any other move.
I can't believe it.
He stole my move.
What else did you tell him?
The two of you must have had quite a little chat.
Oh, it wasn't like that.
I didn't even mention you.
We were in the garage.
You know how garages are.
They're conducive to sex talk.
It's a high-testosterone area.
Because of all the pistons and the lube jobs?
Well, I'm going to that garage to tell him to stop doing it.
- Well, wait Wait a second.
- What?
Isn't that a little rash?
No, he stole my move.
Yeah, but I like the move.
Yeah, but it's like another comedian stealing my material.
He doesn't even do it exactly the same.
He uses a pinch at the end instead of the swirl.
Oh, yeah, the pinch.
I've done the pinch.
That's not new.
I don't know how you can trust any of his moves now.
His whole repertoire could be lifted.
You know, it's strange, because he's such an honest mechanic.
I know, he's probably the only honest mechanic in New York.
So he stole my move, and he's using it on Elaine.
You told David Puddy your move, and you didn't tell me?
I need a move.
You know I have no moves, Jerry.
- Give me a bite.
- Can I just get it open first?
I can't believe you're hoarding sex moves.
I'm rubbing two sticks together, you're walking around with a Zippo.
All right, all right.
Here.
That's good.
That's very good.
- You feel better?
- Yeah, much better.
So, what's the move?
Because I need something.
This woman I'm dating is doing her nails during lovemaking.
- Nancy Klopper?
- Yeah.
I've never seen anyone so bored.
I'm working like a dog here.
Give me a moan, something.
I'd settle for a belch, for God's sake.
Come on, let's have it.
All right, George, I'm gonna tell you.
But I just want to make sure Yeah, it's in the vault.
I'm putting it in the vault.
It's not even a question of that.
The point is, when something like this is passed along one must be certain that it's going to be used in a conscientious way.
This is not some parlor trick to be used pell-mell or willy-nilly.
- You gonna tell me or not?
All right.
On your bed, you got a headboard?
You'll need a headboard.
I got a headboard.
- Is it padded?
- No.
Good.
- How tall is she?
- Five-foot-4, why?
You can't have more than a 1 foot differential in your heights.
Otherwise you could really hurt your neck.
I can't tell you how much I appreciate this.
George, if you can master this, you'll never be alone again.
Now the end is kind of an option.
I use the swirl.
I like the swirl.
I'm comfortable with the swirl.
I feel the swirl is a great capper.
He uses the pinch, which I find a little presumptuous.
- Is it a clockwise swirl?
- I prefer clockwise.
But it's not written in stone.
There you go, buddy.
- What is it?
- It's fusilli Jerry.
It's made from fusilli pasta.
See the microphone?
- When did you do this?
- In my spare time.
I'm working on one of you, George.
I'm using ravioli.
See, the hard part is to find a pasta that captures the individual.
- Why fusilli?
- Because you're silly.
Get it?
- Yeah.
- Well, thank you very much.
- So did you get your new plates?
- Oh, yeah, I got my new plates.
But they mixed them up.
Somebody got mine, and I got their vanity plates.
- What do they say?
- "Assman.
" - Assman?
- Yeah, Assman, Jerry.
I'm Cosmo Kramer, the Assman.
Who would order a license plate that says Assman?
Maybe they're Wilt Chamberlain's.
It doesn't have to be someone who gets lots of woman.
It could be just some guy with a big ass.
- Yeah, or it could be a proctologist.
- Yeah.
- Proctologist.
- No, come on.
No doctor would put that on his car.
Have you ever met a proctologist?
Well, they usually have a very good sense of humor.
You meet a proctologist at a party, don't walk away.
Plant yourself there.
You will hear the funniest stories you've ever heard.
See, no one wants to admit to them that they stuck something up there.
Never.
It's always an accident.
Every proctologist's story ends in the same way: "It was a million-1 shot, doc.
Million-1".
There's my phone.
- So where you gonna stick this?
- I'll tell you where I'd like to stick it.
Hey, David.
Oh, hi, Jerry.
Hey, what's the story?
I hear you're doing my move.
What move?
What move?
My move.
The one I told you about.
You used it on Elaine.
What, are you kidding?
I was doing that before I knew you.
- All you told me about was the end.
- The ending is the whole thing.
Without the ending, it's nothing.
You had nothing.
That ending was so obvious.
I would've figured that out anyway.
Didn't need you to tell me that stupid twist.
- Twirl.
- Whatever, I don't do it.
- Yeah, I know.
You do the pinch.
- Yeah.
That's right.
You can't come up with your own stuff, so you steal other people's?
You're nothing but a hack.
Are you through, because I've gotta get back to work.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
If you wanna do it out of town, okay.
But not in the city.
The next time your car breaks down, take that out of town.
- Fine.
- Good.
George!
What are you doing?
I'm you know pleasuring you.
Well, stop it.
- You don't like the move?
- No, I don't.
- You're kidding.
- No, I'm not.
It feels like aliens poking at my body.
Sorry.
I'll just go back to my usual routine.
Oh, God.
Oh, God, Dave!
Oh, yes, yes.
- I'm sorry.
- What?
I can't do the move.
- What?
- He's ruined it for me.
- Oh, come on.
Please?
- No, he called me a hack.
I'm just not into doing it anymore.
So that's it?
I'll come up with some new stuff.
"Call me.
36-24-46.
I think I have what you're looking for.
" I must caution you about one thing: You can't cry for at least 10 days.
You can ruin the operation.
Oh, okay.
Now, is someone coming to pick you up?
Yes, my son's friend should be here any minute.
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, Dr. Cosmo Kramer.
Proctology.
- Okay.
Sure, doctor.
- Thanks.
Have a good day.
I just can't get over how fantastic you look.
- Oh, really?
- Oh, yeah.
This takes 20 years off.
And it was all done by laser.
I don't even need bandages.
Yo, Assman.
Look at the Assman.
- Did he say, "Assman"?
- Yeah.
Oh, my goodness.
- Hey, the Assman's in town.
- You got that straight.
Boy, I never dreamed it could make such a difference.
Well, you must have done something wrong.
You probably screwed up the order.
Did you close with the swirl?
You're supposed to close with the swirl?
Oh, my God.
Yes, you close with the swirl.
There's a progression there.
I told you to write it down.
Yeah, yeah.
Should've written it down.
- Yeah?
- Elaine.
All right.
Do me a favor.
Don't even do the move anymore.
You're gonna give it a bad name.
Hello.
Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld.
What?
$2800?
That's the estimate on my car?
No, don't even do anything.
I'm gonna think about it.
Okay, bye.
What's to think about?
Puddy's not gonna cheat you.
- Except it's not Puddy.
- What happened to Puddy?
We had a fight about the move.
I took it to this other place.
- I think they're trying to screw me.
- Of course they're trying to screw you.
That's what they do.
They can make up anything.
Nobody knows.
"By the way, you need a new Johnson rod in here.
" "Oh, Johnson rod?
Yeah, well, better put one of those on.
" - Hey, Elaine.
- Yeah, yeah, hello.
- Was it something I said?
- Yes, as a matter of fact.
David Puddy won't do the move anymore.
Really?
He's come up with some other move.
You should see this thing.
- What is it?
- It's a lot of just fancy stuff.
You know what it's like?
It's like big-budget movie with a story that goes nowhere.
I mean, this move is no good, Jerry.
It's just taking up a lot of my time.
And I will not stand by and allow him to perform this move on me while a perfectly good move is just sitting in the barn doing nothing.
Let me ask you a question.
This new move is there a knuckle involved in any way?
Yes.
Yes, as a matter of fact there is.
I think that's mine.
I'm not surprised.
Listen, I need you to do me a favor.
When's the next time you're gonna see him?
- Why?
- Get an estimate on my car from him.
This garage is trying to screw me.
An estimate?
How am I supposed to do that?
Look, here's the work order with everything that broke.
Just kind of bring it up at the right time and find out.
What?
What is this?
That's fusilli Jerry.
- Fusilli Jerry?
- Yeah, Kramer made it.
- All right, listen, I'll see you guys later.
- All right.
- Hey, Assman.
- Hey.
- Well, this is Sally.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Shall we go?
All right.
- Okay.
You can't face the fact that I'm improving myself.
You're not the only one improving yourself.
I worked out with a dumbbell yesterday.
I feel vigorous.
Just take your mail and go home.
I have things to do.
I got things to do too.
Don't upset me.
I can't cry!
Getting an eye job like some Manhattanite, huh?
Well, it's already working.
Kramer made a pass at me.
Kramer made a pass at you?
You're crazy.
I'm not crazy.
He stopped short and made a grab.
He stopped short?
That's my move.
I'm gonna kill him.
- Hey, let me ask you a question.
- Sure.
What do you charge for blown shocks?
- What?
- Two-, 300?
I don't know, maybe 500.
- What about a bad gasket?
- Bad gasket?
Yeah, like a terrible gasket.
- What is all this?
- Nothing, nothing.
I'm just taking an interest in what you do.
What kind of car is it?
Any kind of a Swedish car.
All together that could run about 1600.
Is that with the parts and labor?
No.
Dave, no, please.
Not the knuckle.
Well that was great.
I mean It just came to me.
I've never in my life I've What was that?
You mean in the end?
A counterclockwise swirl.
- What's that?
- What?
- On your hand?
Let me see.
- Nothing.
I don't know.
It's a mole.
- Let me see.
- Just a little dirt.
I wanna see what's on your hand.
Give me your hand.
"Number one, take her leg " Oh, my God.
Crib notes?
You've got crib notes?
It's a very complicated move.
I couldn't remember it all.
Oh, my God, you're sick.
You know, it's not the SATs.
Assman?
I'll give him Assman!
Sixteen hundred dollars?
That's all?
They are ripping me off.
- So, what are you gonna do?
- That's it.
I'm going back to Puddy.
No move is worth this.
You don't care if he does the move anymore?
Are you kidding?
He could do every move I've ever done.
Do you know what a good mechanic is worth?
You can't compare that to sex.
- Hi, Mr. Costanza, what's..
?
- Where's your friend, Kramer?
- I don't know, why?
- I'm looking for him, that's why.
- He stopped short.
- What do you mean?
In the car with my wife.
He stopped short.
You think I don't know what that's about?
That's my own move.
I used it on Estelle 40 years ago.
I told everybody about it.
Everybody knows I stop short.
Really?
Stopping short?
That's a good move.
You're not kidding it's a good move.
- Hey.
- Hey, Frank.
Don't "Frank" me.
I know what you did.
How dare you stop short with my wife?
Come on, Frank, relax.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You think I don't know, Assman?
To think I almost split the profits on the Mansiere with you.
- Bro.
- Mansiere!
- Bro!
- Mansiere!
Oh, my God.
If I wasn't there, I wouldn't have believed it.
Me either.
They say this guy's the best.
He had to use corkscrew pasta.
Jerry, Jerry, come here.
Take a look at this.
The name on the boat.
Look at it.
- Assman!
- Yeah, he's the Assman.
Jerry, he's the Assman.
- Which one is the son?
- I am.
I'm Dr. Cooperman.
I just want you to know that this won't take long and he's going to be fine.
Excuse me, you didn't by any chance recently get the wrong license plates?
Yes, I'm still waiting for the Motor Vehicle Bureau to straighten it out.
So you're the Assman.
Million- 1 shot, doc.
Million- 1.
Where have you been?
You were supposed to fix the stove.
I've been waiting for hours.
I fell on some fusilli.
- Fusilli?
- You know, the corkscrew pasta.
It was a fusilli Jerry.
It got stuck in me.
I had to go to the proctologist.
The proctologist?
Are you okay?
- Yeah.
- Oh, I was so worried.
- Ma, don't cry!
- Oh, I can't help it!
Ma, your eyes!
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
How about the scam the airlines have with these special clubs?
One hundred fifty dollars a year to sit in a room eat peanuts, drink coffee and soda and read magazines.
Excuse me, isn't this the flight?
I already got four hours of this coming to me.
What am I paying for?
How about an I- got-all-my-luggage club?
Can I get into that?
Where's that club?
I would like to join that club.
Airlines love to divide us up into classes, you know?
When you're sitting in coach they always have the stewardess close that stupid curtain, you know?
They give you that look like: "Maybe if you had worked a little harder " What time does your flight get in?
Six?
All right, that gives us six hours.
Then I'll meet you at the Diplomat's Club.
I'll be the one without the big red sash.
Okay.
See you tonight.
- Is that the supermodel?
- Yep.
She's not gonna be back for a month, but I have six hours.
I thought you had a show in Ithaca.
I do, but it's 3:00.
I'm flying right back.
Then I'm gonna meet Bridgette at the Diplomat's Club.
Well, guess what I'm doing.
I'm going to Mr. Pitt's, and I am telling him that I am quitting.
So that's it?
You know, I never even met the guy.
I've had enough.
I am marching in.
- You're marching in?
- I'm marching.
- Hey.
Hey.
- Hey, Elaine's quitting.
- Really?
- I'm marching in.
I've done the march in.
Best feeling.
- How about the march out?
- Not as good.
You realize all the money you're losing.
Oh, boy.
Okay, that's it.
- Wish me luck.
- Yeah.
Get a march going.
March it.
- Jerry, I need to borrow your camera.
- Why?
Well, I wanna put a picture of me and my boss up in the office.
What for?
Well, he's reorganizing the whole staff and I'm on thin ice with this guy as it is.
Isn't putting his picture on your desk a little transparent?
It better be.
- Mr. Pitt, I have something to tell you.
- One second, Elaine.
- Mr. Pitt - Elaine.
Do you know what I just did?
I just amended my will to include you as a beneficiary.
What?
Well, I think of you as part of my family.
You've come to be like a daughter to me.
I want to make sure that you're taken care of after I'm gone.
Mr. Pitt.
I feel a cold coming on.
Could you get me a cold pill?
Oh, no, Mr. Pitt, you mustn't.
You have to check before you combine anything with your heart medicine.
Yes, yes.
I'll check with the pharmacist.
We don't want anything to happen to you, Mr. Pitt.
We want you to live a long, long time.
Look at that, I only got one picture left.
How about a shot of me and Mr. Morgan?
- Why?
- Why?
Because we're a team.
Come on.
Would you take this for us, dear?
Thank you very much.
Here we go.
Anyone ever tell you you look a lot like Sugar Ray Leonard?
- Excuse me?
- Yeah, you must hear that all the time.
I suppose we all look alike to you, right, Costanza?
What?
What?
No, no, no.
No, no, it's not a racial thing.
There really is a resemblance.
Don't you think he looks like Sugar Ray?
Come on, somebody.
Back me up.
Come on.
A little help.
Maybe he looks a little like Sugar Ray Leonard.
A little?
Come on.
Well, you still shouldn't have said it.
You think Morgan thinks I have a racial bias?
Maybe.
Boy, that is so unfair.
I would've marched on Selma if it was in Long Island.
- You'd have marched on Great Neck?
- Absolutely.
I still might.
I always hated those girls.
They would never date me.
- Hey.
- Hey, there you are.
- So you ready?
- For what?
He's taking me to the airport.
We got a few minutes.
Oh, yeah.
What, you got no luggage?
This is it.
I'm only going for the day.
- I just gotta pick up a toothbrush.
- Okay.
Hey, Kramer.
Who does that look like?
- I don't know.
- Come on, come on.
- Not salt, but..
?
- What, Pepper Johnson?
No.
Sugar Ray Leonard.
Oh, no way.
All right, I'll tell you what.
I'll bet you the next three people I ask two of them will say Sugar Ray.
How much?
$100?
$200?
$1000?
Wait, what are you doing?
You're not betting.
- You know he's not supposed to bet.
- Come on, Jerry, it's a lock.
Kramer, you've had this thing under control for almost three years now.
Don't start again.
- But it's a lock, Jerry.
- No.
- What're you doing about Morgan?
- You know what would be great?
If he could see me with some of my black friends.
Except you don't really have any black friends.
Outside of us, you don't have any white friends either.
- Yes?
- Hello, Joe?
- Who is this?
- It's me.
- George Costanza.
- Who?
Remember I was here a while back?
We watched Breakfast at Tiffany's together?
What do you want?
Well, I've rented another video, Joe.
And there's some popcorn.
- I thought we could do it again.
- Go away.
Remy.
Hi.
You.
What are you doing here?
Well, I got another Audrey Hepburn movie.
- Remy, is that you?
- Daddy, that man's here again.
Remy, I want you up here instantly.
You know, Remy, I was thinking.
Last time we were together, you That's great.
You know what?
Leave it.
Just pull the car around front.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
I'll take care of it.
Just throw that in there, would you?
Excuse me.
I take heart medication.
What would you recommend for a runny nose?
Take an antihistamine.
They're over there.
- It's all right to take?
- Yeah, they're great.
What about appetite suppressants?
I just saw them.
Oh, here.
Here you go.
- Thank you, young man.
- Have a good day, sir.
- This is your swanky Diplomat's Club.
- I don't see Katie anywhere.
What's this, a fellow club member?
No, she's this woman who's booking me on these college tours.
She thinks I'm some big celebrity that has to be pampered and explained every little thing.
Yeah.
I'm gonna get some snacks before my flight.
- Jerry.
- Oh, hi, Katie.
- You found the airport all right?
- Yes, I followed the planes.
I see you're having coffee.
Just so you know, they also have decaf as well.
And I talked to the hostess, they'll also be serving coffee on the plane along with a selection of cocktails and soft Thanks.
Thanks for telling me.
What's going on?
I'm Lenore Walker, Mr. Pitt's estate lawyer.
I arrived to discuss his will and found Justin had collapsed on the floor.
Oh, my God.
- Who are you?
- This is the girl I want to put in my will.
- Elaine, I - Please.
Rest, Mr. Pitt.
Oh, you're the assistant.
Why weren't you here taking care of him?
Well, he gave me the morning off.
I was doing a little shopping.
How did this happen?
He took a very dangerous combination of prescription heart medicine and these other pills.
You were supposed to talk to the pharmacist.
I spoke to somebody who worked there.
Oh, I'm gonna go and call that pharmacy.
How well do you know her?
Jerry, just so you know, before we take off they'll tell us what to do in event of a crash.
Yes, I know.
I've flown before.
Oh, good.
I just didn't want you to freak out.
The chance of a crash is very slim.
- Do you have to go to the bathroom?
- No.
Even if you have to go a little, you better go now because you can't until after takeoff.
- Hey, how you doing?
- Pretty good.
Name's Kramer.
Earl Haffler.
Nice to meet you.
I'm headed to Houston.
Where you headed?
Oh, I'm happy right here.
Isn't this place amazing?
Planes flying in from all corners of the world and they know the minute when they're arriving.
Oh, they don't know a darn thing.
That's why my flight to Houston has been delayed.
They're all morons.
Matter of fact, I'll bet you that that flight to Pittsburgh takes off before my flight to Houston.
Bet?
- Not a betting man.
- Friendly wager.
- I haven't made a bet in three years.
- Oh, come on.
Keep things interesting, pass the time.
- Okay, how much?
- How about 200.
You're on, cowboy.
- How you doing?
- Okay.
- Nice day today.
- What?
I'm George, George Costanza.
You live around here?
Now arriving at gate 12 - This could be Mexico City.
- Come on, Seattle, let's go.
- Come on, Mexico City!
- Seattle!
Seattle!
Flight number 42 from Mexico City.
Yeah, buddy.
All right, come on, let's go again.
Let's go again.
Mr. Pitt, do you need anything?
No.
You need to sit up.
Why don't I get you a pillow.
Okay.
It's a pretty full house, lighting guy's name is Lou.
- He's got a birthday next week.
- Yeah, I don't care.
By the way, I don't want you to freak out but the pilot is going to be in the audience.
Who?
Remember the plane we took here?
The pilot is going to be sitting out there watching the show.
I don't care.
Why are you telling me this?
I just didn't want you to freak out.
Why would I freak out?
Pilot.
All right, ladies and gentlemen, a big hand for Mr. Jerry Seinfeld.
Hey!
All right.
Good afternoon, Ithaca.
Welcome.
Good to see you here.
Boy, I noticed there's a lot of those orange cones you have out on the thruway on the way up here.
I was I - It didn't go very well, did it?
- No, it didn't.
And you know why?
Seeing that pilot in the audience really freaked me out.
I knew it.
If you hadn't mentioned anything, I would've been fine.
I became obsessed with him.
Why did I invite him?
Stupid.
Stupid.
When he asked for tickets, I should've said no.
- I'm gonna go chew him out.
- Oh, it doesn't matter now.
- Don't you worry, I'm on top of this.
- Yeah, you're on top of it.
And I'm on the bottom!
Well, Mr. Kramer, looks like you're in the hole $3200.
Will that be cash or check?
Come on, one more bet.
Double or nothing, huh?
All right.
But I wanna see some cash on the table.
All right, let me call my bank, huh?
All right, you stay here.
- Hello?
- Yeah, it's me.
Hey, what's up?
All right, listen, I need some cash.
- What for?
- I just need it, that's all.
Oh, no.
Don't tell me.
You're gambling again, aren't you?
You weak, weak man.
- Where are you?
- I'm at the airport.
- The airport?
- Betting on arrivals and departures.
But I'm down 3200 bucks, so you gotta get me some cash.
- I don't have that kind of dough.
- Sure you do.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Not the bag.
Help me, man.
I'm desperate.
All right, all right.
Sorry for the delay, folks.
There is a slight complication, but we're taking care of it and we'll be on our way to LaGuardia.
What is the complication?
- Mr. Seinfeld?
- Yes?
I'm sorry, but the pilot has asked that you leave this plane.
What?
Apparently he has some sort of problem with you.
I'm not surprised.
I really let him have it, Jerry.
He had no business being in your audience if you didn't want him there.
I didn't care.
Well, now the pilot doesn't want you on his plane.
He can't just throw me off the plane.
Yes, he can, if he has cause to believe that a passenger will be a disturbance.
But I'm not a disturbance.
Well, apparently you are disturbing him, sir.
But someone is waiting for me.
- Jerry, I don't want you to freak out.
- I'm freaking out!
I am freaking out!
There's a flight leaving at 8 and another one leaving at 8:30.
Which one do you want?
Which one do you think I want?
- The 8 will get you in a little earlier.
- Then we'll make it the 8.
Okay, I'll book a hotel.
A standard room or a mini-suite?
- Hotel?
- Yeah, it's 8 in the morning.
No, no, I have to get home tonight.
Bridgette's gonna be waiting for me at the Diplomat's Club.
Rent a car.
Midsize, luxury or sports model?
What's your preference?
I don't have a preference, okay?
Just make a decision yourself.
All right?
Stop bothering me with every minor detail.
Please?
Okay.
You're the big celebrity.
- Hello?
- George.
- Hey, Jerry.
How was Ithaca?
- I'm still here.
You gotta go down to the Diplomat's Club Hey, Jerry, what was the name of that exterminator who fumigated your apartment when you had fleas?
- Karl, I think.
- Karl.
Yeah, yeah.
- He was a nice guy.
- Yeah, he was nice.
- What company was it?
- Defend.
Defend.
Yeah.
You know, we spoke for a little bit.
- You need an exterminator?
- No, not really.
Oh, don't tell me.
- Because he's black?
- Gotta go.
George?
George?
Hello, this is Jerry Seinfeld.
Is Elaine there?
Hold on.
Elaine, there's a Jerry Seinfeld on the phone for you.
- Hello?
- Elaine.
I need a big favor.
Go down to the Diplomat's Club and meet Bridgette for me.
I'm late.
- That's at the airport, right?
- Right.
She'll think I stood her up.
I'll never get another date with her.
- She'll freak out!
- All right, all right.
- You sound a little freaked out yourself.
- I am a little freaked out!
Calm down.
I'll take care of it.
- All right, but you have to leave now!
- I said, I'll take care of it.
- Kramer.
- Hey.
- Okay, here it is.
- All right, good.
Here's my collateral.
So it's a mailbag.
So what?
So what?
Do you know whose mailbag that is?
David Berkowitz.
Son of Sam.
The worst mass murderer the post office ever produced.
- Where'd you get this?
- I took over his route.
And, boy, were there a lot of dogs on that route.
- Any of them talking to you?
- Just to tell me to keep off the snacks.
- Your bud is a hell of a guy.
- Yeah, don't I know it.
Okay, Cosmo, we're back in business.
Yeah.
Let's check out the board.
Now, who do you like?
All right, how about Ithaca versus Boston?
All right.
I'm gonna give you a sporting chance.
I'll take Ithaca.
- Double or nothing.
- Double or nothing.
I hope you know what you're doing.
- Where are we?
- I'm not sure.
- Is this even a road?
- Oh, we lost the road half-hour ago.
What?
Well, why didn't you wake me up?
You told me not to bother you with minor details.
- No road is a major detail.
- Okay, now I know.
Should I keep going or turn around?
Do you have a preference?
Look out!
- May I help you?
- I'm the exterminator.
Oh, yes, of course.
Come in.
Why didn't you want me to bring my equipment or wear my uniform?
Well, if the other people in the office saw that I had called an exterminator they would just panic.
They're a jittery group.
Besides, this is sort of a friendly visit.
- Karl, right?
- Do I know you?
Yeah.
We met at Jerry Seinfeld's apartment when you fumigated for fleas over there.
Seinfeld.
Oh, yeah.
Funny white guy, right?
Jerry?
Yes, I suppose he is white.
I never really thought about it.
I don't really see people in terms of color.
You know, there's someone I'd like you to meet.
Hang on a second.
- Is Mr. Morgan in?
- Mr. Morgan left for dinner.
He left?
Karl, you hungry?
Here's a new twist on car-pooling: Early this morning a lost Manhattanite drove through a residential back yard and wound up in a swimming pool near Ithaca, New York.
Comedian Jerry Seinfeld, a passenger seemed a little freaked out.
That's it!
No more questions!
I don't care!
No!
No!
No!
That's him.
That's the man who gave me the pills in the drugstore.
He's no pharmacist.
Seinfeld?
I know that name.
He called here earlier for Elaine.
Oh, by the way, order anything you want, it's all on me.
Just do me a tiny favor.
Pretend we're old friends.
Oh, my God, Mr. Morgan.
What a coincidence.
It's Mr. Morgan.
Come here.
Mr. Morgan, I want you to meet a dear old friend of mine, Karl.
I'm the exterminator.
That's what we used to call him in high school, "The Exterminator.
" He was a linebacker.
Oh, boy.
Oh, did we have some wild times.
Well, that Newman was your good-luck charm.
- Yeah, he sure was.
- I should've quit at double or nothing.
- Traveler's checks acceptable?
- Oh, I accept.
Yeah, he worked in the cubicle right next to me.
We once double-dated.
Yeah.
It's a pleasure doing business with a gentleman like yourself.
- Kramer.
- Elaine, what are you doing here?
Jerry asked me to meet his girlfriend here.
You hear about his plane in Ithaca?
What about the plane in Ithaca?
Our stupid friend freaked out the pilot single-handedly delayed the plane a whole hour.
- Can you believe that?
- Boy.
Your friend caused the delay?
- You're a cheat.
- No, wait - Nobody hustles Earl Haffler.
- Oh, come on.
- See you around, Cosmo.
- What?
Howdy, ma'am.
Poison you?
Jerry Seinfeld tried to poison you?
What?
What?
Mr. Pitt, what are you, delirious?
He's never even met you.
You're fired, Elaine.
Goodbye.
Goodbye?
- Bridgette.
- Jerry, what happened?
I'm so sorry.
I got stuck out of town.
I missed our whole time together.
Well, my plane doesn't leave for another half-hour.
Really?
Oh, my God.
It's him.
It's the pilot!
I love this place.
You know, Karl and I come here all the time.
- Is that right?
- Yeah, I come here all the time.
You wouldn't believe the rat droppings in the kitchen.
So you really are an exterminator?
This time, George, you've sunk to a new low.
Check, please.
Hey, Sugar Ray Leonard can eat here on the house.
Hear that?
Hear that?
Mr. Morgan!
Did you hear that?
Mr. Morgan!
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
Monkeys are the end of the line in the pet world.
At that level of pet ownership have a kid.
I mean, come on.
I mean, you're so close.
If you need a pet that can roller-skate and smoke cigars it's time to think about a family.
Monkeys, of course, were the first astronauts, in the '60s which I'm sure made perfect sense in the monkey brain.
"I feel that is the next logical step for me.
I've been working with the Italian guy and the crank organ and I think I'm ready to handle the maximum-reentry G-forces.
" Take toilet paper, for example.
Do you realize that toilet paper has not changed in my lifetime?
It's just paper on a cardboard roll.
That's it.
And in 10,000 years, it will still be exactly the same because, really, what else can they do?
Yeah, that's true.
There really has been no development in toilet paper.
And, I mean, everything else has changed.
But toilet paper is exactly the same, and will be so until we're dead.
Yeah, you're right, George.
What else can they do?
It's just paper on a roll.
That's it, and that's all it will ever be.
You find this interesting, don't you?
Yes.
Yes, I do.
Oh, thanks very much.
The soup was really good.
- What are you telling him for?
- What?
He's the busboy.
You think he cares about the soup?
Yeah, why, wouldn't he want the soup to be good?
Elaine, it's all this guy can do to keep from killing himself.
Come on.
You think he's back there with the chef, going, "Hey, they like the soup!
Keep it up.
" - Hey, isn't that Alec Berg?
- Yeah.
Alec Berg.
He's got a good John Houseman name.
- Yeah.
- Alec Berg.
Mr. Berg.
I can't stand him.
He is so pretentious.
- John Houseman?
- No, Alec Berg.
- Elaine!
How are you?
- Hi!
- Jerry.
- Hi, Alec.
- Did you hear about Gary Fogel?
- Yeah.
- You gonna go to the funeral Friday?
- Yeah, yeah.
Hey, did I see you on TV at the Ranger game?
- Those your seats behind the glass?
- Those are them.
Season tickets.
Unfortunately, I can't go tonight.
They're available, if you'd like them.
I'd love to.
Are you sure?
Sure.
Call my secretary.
She'll arrange everything.
- Thanks.
Thanks a lot.
- It's my pleasure.
Be good.
I actually might not use them on Friday either, so I'll let you know.
All right.
Thanks again.
Thank you very much.
Really, thank you.
Well, what about these nitwits that get on a plane with nothing to read?
- You know who they are?
- Who?
These are the people that wanna talk to you.
They got nothing else to do, why not disturb you?
I will never understand people.
They're the worst.
Something's up There's something in the air Well, what is with you?
Well I think this is it.
What's it?
- I saw Siena again.
- Siena?
He's dating a crayon.
We discussed toilet paper.
- Toilet paper?
- Yep, yep.
I told her how toilet paper hasn't changed in my lifetime and probably wouldn't for the next 50,000 years and she was fascinated, fascinated!
- What are you talking about?
- Yeah.
- Toilet paper's changed.
- Yeah.
- It's softer.
- Softer.
- More sheets per roll.
- Sheets.
- A wide variety of colors.
- Colors.
Okay, fine.
Fine!
It's changed!
It's not really the point.
Anyway, I'm thinking of making a big move.
What?
I might tell her that I love her.
Oh, my.
I came this close last night, and then I just sort of chickened out.
Well, that's a big move, Georgie boy.
Are you confident in the "I love you" return?
Fifty-fifty.
Because if you don't get that return that's a pretty big matzo ball hanging out there.
Well, I just gotta say it once.
Everybody else gets to say it.
Why can't I say it?
What, you never said it?
Once.
To a dog.
He licked himself and left the room.
Well, so it wasn't a total loss.
- Hey.
- Hey, I forgot to tell you.
I got tickets to the Rangers-Devils playoff tonight.
Oh, I'm there.
- What about you, George?
- Can't do it, can't do it.
- Sorry.
Got a date.
- So?
So?
No, no, no, if you must know I would rather be with her than go to the game.
Well, she must be a very special lady, huh, George?
- What do I do with the extra ticket?
- Oh, hey!
Can I bring David Puddy?
- He's a big Devils fan.
- Sure, fine with me.
Hey, by the way, if anybody wants an inside tour of the zoo Siena works there as a trainer.
- So she works at the zoo?
- Yeah.
Yeah, like Dian Fossey, huh?
She's the only person that's ever been accepted into gorilla society.
And you know, once those gorillas accept you you got it made in the shade.
So how long have you been a Devils fan?
- Since I was a kid.
I'm from Jersey.
- Yeah?
- We're gonna kick your butts tonight.
- Ain't no way, man!
- Yes.
- We're primed.
You almost ready?
Jerry and Kramer are gonna be here any second.
- What the..
?
- So, what do you think?
- What is that?
- I painted my face.
- You painted your face?
- Yeah.
- Why?
- Well, you know, support the team.
- Well, you can't walk around like that.
- Why not?
Because it's insane.
You gotta let them know you're out there.
This is the playoffs.
- Hey.
- Hi.
Dave's painted his face.
Yeah, yeah, that's cool.
You gotta support your team.
- Okay.
Ready to go?
- Yeah.
Let's get it on!
All right!
Go Devils!
Go Devils!
Let's go, Devils!
You stink, Messier!
We're gonna get you, Messier!
Will you sit down?
Hey, man, I'm just trying to support the team.
Will you sit down?
You're disturbing everybody.
Sit down!
Because you're a Rangers fan and you know I'm messing with their heads.
Yeah, Devils goal!
Devils goal!
Stephane Richer scores from just inside the blue line.
And the Devils Well, you know, I could've actually gone tonight.
So why didn't you?
Well, I didn't wanna break our date.
Oh, well Because I I love you.
You know, I'm hungry.
Let's get something to eat.
We took it to you.
You couldn't get it out of your zone.
We were aggressive.
- We didn't let you penetrate.
- That's enough out of you.
There's still three more games left in this series, my friend and it's far from being over, very far from being over.
Hey, what are you doing?
Watch where you're driving, man!
Don't mess with a Devil, buddy.
We're number one.
We beat anybody.
We're the Devils!
The Devils!
"I'm hungry.
Let's get something to eat.
" Yep.
- Big matzo ball.
- Huge matzo ball.
Those damn "I love you" returns.
- Well, it's all over.
I slipped up.
- Oh, you don't know.
You know how fast things deteriorate when there's an "I love you" out of the bag?
You can't have a relationship where one person says, "I love you" and the other one says, "I'm hungry.
Let's get something to eat.
" Unless you're married.
She thinks I'm one of these guys that loves her.
Nobody wants somebody that loves them.
- No.
People hate that.
- You want somebody who doesn't like you.
- Ideally.
I am never saying "I love you" again unless they say it first.
- Matzo ball soup?
- That would be me.
Hey, Jerry, you're a smart guy, right?
- No question about it.
- All right.
I was supposed to go on this special tour with George's girlfriend.
- At the zoo?
- Yeah.
But before I met up with her I stopped to look at the monkeys when all of a sudden I am hit in the face with a banana peel.
I turn and look, and there is this monkey really laughing it up.
Then someone tells me that he did it.
Well, I pick up the banana peel and I wait for that monkey to turn around, and then  I let him have it.
Kramer, you threw a banana peel at a monkey?
Well, he started it!
- It's a monkey, Kramer!
- Well, he pushed my buttons.
I couldn't help it, Jerry.
Well, I still think it's wrong.
All right, fine.
You take the monkey's side.
Go ahead.
- I'm not taking anyone's side.
- I know what happened, Jerry.
Did you call Alec Berg and thank him for the hockey tickets?
- No.
- Oh, Jerry, what are you waiting for?
Why am I gonna call?
I thanked him five times when he gave them to me.
Call him the next day.
It's common courtesy.
No.
I'm taking a stand against all this over-thanking.
Jerry, good manners are the glue of society.
If I knew I had to give him I wouldn't have taken the tickets.
You know what this is gonna do?
He'll be upset because you didn't call.
We won't get the tickets for Friday.
- You're out of your mind.
- Where are you going?
I gotta get a suit cleaned.
I have a funeral on Friday.
- Who died?
- Do you remember the guy who pretended he had cancer so I would buy him the toupee?
- So he actually had it?
- No, car accident.
He was adjusting his toupee while he was driving and he lost control of the car.
That poor priest.
He was just visiting from El Salvador.
Now he's gone completely loco.
- The one Puddy screamed at?
- Yeah.
He thinks he saw the devil.
He won't leave his room in the church basement.
That's what you get for getting mixed up with a face-painter.
What compels a seemingly normal human to do something like that?
Gotta support the team.
You know, I really hate my clothes.
I open up my closet, there's just nothing.
Nothing.
I hate everything I have.
I really hate it.
I mean, at this point, it's It's like I can wear something three or four times and that's it.
It's getting to be a terrible problem for me.
Hey, Alec.
Did you see that?
What kind of a hello was that?
Mr. Kramer, thanks for coming.
So, what did you wanna see me about?
Well, Mr. Kramer, to get right to it we're having a bit of a problem with Barry.
- Barry?
- The chimpanzee.
Well, what's the problem?
Well, he's not functioning the way he normally does.
He seems depressed.
He's lost his appetite.
He's even curtailed his autoerotic activities.
And we think this is directly related to the altercation he had with you.
So?
So, what do you want me to do?
Well, frankly we'd like you to apologize.
Well, he started it.
Mr. Kramer, he's an innocent primate.
So am I. What about my feelings?
Don't my feelings count?
Only the poor monkey's important.
Everything's done for the monkey.
Look, I'm sorry.
I Hey, that's okay.
Well, I gotta go feed the marmoset.
You know, George really likes you.
I don't Oh, she doesn't hear too well out of her left ear.
Do you think it's possible that he's mad at me because he didn't get the day-after thank-you?
- Wait.
You were at a funeral, right?
- Yeah.
Well, people never give a good hello at the funeral.
I mean, they go like this: - That's the biggest.
- That's kind of what he gave me.
Yeah, they can't go, "Hey!
You look fabulous"!
- Hey.
- Hey.
I just spoke to your girlfriend.
- Girlfriend.
Yeah, right.
- She asked me to apologize to Barry.
- Barry?
- The monkey.
- Well?
- Nothing doing.
Jerry, I didn't do anything.
It's the monkey that should be apologizing to me.
- I don't think that's gonna happen.
- Well, I'm sorry.
I tried to put the good word in for you with Siena but I don't think she heard me.
You know, left ear.
- What?
- Yeah, her boss told me that she can't hear very well out of her left ear.
What, you didn't know that?
- Oh, my God.
- What?
She probably never heard it.
Don't you see what this means?
It's like the whole thing never happened.
It's like when Superman reversed the rotation of the Earth to save Lois Lane.
Are you gonna say it again?
That's the question, Jimmy.
- I'm gonna do it.
- What?
After what you went through?
You said you'd never say it again.
I'd like to say it once to someone that can actually hear it!
- Yeah!
- Hey, buddy.
- Boy, what's going on?
- He's gonna talk into her other ear.
Listen, I almost forgot to ask you.
What happened at the funeral?
Did you talk to Alec Berg?
- Yeah, I saw him.
- So he'll give you the hockey tickets?
Well, not exactly.
He's mad, isn't he?
See, I knew it.
- I don't know if he's mad.
- What happened when you saw him?
I didn't really get a good hello.
But I was at a funeral.
So I don't know if I got a funeral hello or he was mad because he didn't get his day-after thank-you.
- See?
I told you, Jerry!
I told you!
- What do you want me to do?
I want you to get on this phone and give him his thank-you!
No.
No, I can't!
Jerry, this is the way society functions.
Aren't you a part of society?
Because if you don't wanna be a part of society why don't you just get in your car and move to the East Side.
Look, we got five hours before the game.
I am betting it was a funeral hello.
We're here.
He knows the number.
He knows we wanna go.
There's plenty of time for him to call.
You stubborn, stupid, silly man!
Hey, great dip.
You make this?
No, it's from the store.
Hey, how come people don't have dip for dinner?
Why is it only a snack?
I don't understand stuff like that.
David - David, I think we ought to talk.
- All right, that's cool.
David, I don't think we should see each other anymore.
You gotta be kidding.
How come?
Well, you see, David you're a face-painter.
Yeah, that's right.
Well, it's not that I don't like you but, well, to be perfectly honest I'm just having some trouble getting past the face-painting.
So you don't like the face-painting.
I just won't paint it anymore.
Yeah.
But you like the face-painting.
Well, I don't need to do it.
It's not like a habit or anything.
- You mean you'd stop it for me?
- Yeah, that's right.
That's so - That's so sweet.
- Come here.
I gotta go home and change before the game.
I'll be back.
We'll make out.
Siena, I love you.
Yeah, I know.
I heard you the first time.
Yeah.
Just confirming.
Hello?
Oh, hi, Mom.
No, I was expecting somebody else.
I'm sorry, I can't talk, I gotta keep the line clear.
I know I have call waiting, but I don't trust it in an emergency.
Goodbye.
Anyway I just wanna say that I'm sorry.
I lost my temper, and I probably shouldn't have.
I took it out on you and Look, if I've caused you any problems as a result of my behavior well, then, I'm sorry.
I apologize.
Even though you know, Barry, between me and you we both know that you started it.
I mean, who's kidding who?
But they tell me that you're very upset and God forbid I should disturb the very important monkey.
I hope we can put this behind us.
Let's just move on with our lives.
So no hard feelings?
- What is that?
- It's the letter D. Why is the letter D painted on your chest?
I'm going to the game and me and five guys are taking our shirts off and spell out "Devils.
" - But you said no more painting.
- No, I said no more face-painting.
And as you can see, this is not my face.
Yeah, that's right.
Well, did he call?
- No.
- Oh, come on, Jerry!
This is stupid.
It's 6:00!
It's all over!
Just pick up the phone and thank him!
All right.
Hello, Alec?
Hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld.
You know, you got a great John Houseman name.
Alec Berg.
Did you hand in your assignment, Mr. Berg?
What can I do for you, Jerry?
Well, Alec, the reason I called is I just wanted to thank you for the tickets.
I wish you'd called earlier.
I could've given you tickets for tonight.
- Oh, you already gave them away?
- Yeah.
But you know what, I have a friend he's got a couple of seats.
- You mind the nosebleed section?
- We don't care.
We wanna go.
There is one little catch, though.
Hey, great game, huh?
Let's go, Devils!
All right, let's get it up!
Let's get it up!
Come on!
Come on, D!
D!
- E. - V. - I!
- L!
S!
Hello, Father.
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
All right, what am I supposed to do here?
Should I go over there?
It's not like somebody died.
It's Beaches, for God's sake.
If she was sitting next to me, I'd put my arm around her.
I can't see making a big move like going all the way over there.
I can't.
I won't.
So she calls me this morning, tells me she's upset that I didn't console her.
I mean, it was Beaches, for God's sake.
I mean, what do you do in a situation like that?
- Where were you?
- I was sitting on the chair.
She was over here on the couch.
Well, if you were sitting next to her, you'd have to console her.
Of course.
But when you're talking about a movie like Beaches moving from the chair to the couch that's quite a voyage.
- Yeah.
Hey.
Hey, we gotta get going, come on.
- Where are you going?
- Show League game.
The Improv is playing Rochelle, Rochelle: The Musical.
Really?
Is Bette Midler playing?
Is she gonna be there?
She might be.
She's the star of the show.
Bette Midler is gonna be in the park today?
Jerry, don't tease me.
I didn't know you were such a fan.
So maybe I'll go down there and watch.
She'll be there, maybe?
- So is Gennice playing today?
- Yeah, she might be.
- What Gennice?
- That's the understudy.
I'm dating her.
- Is this Bette Midler's understudy?
- Yeah.
Understudies, now, they're a shifty bunch.
The substitute teachers of the theater world.
I'm glad that she's an understudy.
I avoid having to go backstage and think of something to say.
Going backstage is the worst.
Especially when they stink.
Then it's a real problem.
Just once I'd like to tell someone they stink.
"Hey, you know what, I didn't like the show, I didn't like you.
You just really stunk.
The whole thing, real bad.
Stinkaroo.
Thanks for the tickets, though.
" - Ms. Elaine, you late.
- I know, I know.
I didn't have change for the bus.
Nobody will give you change.
So they threw me off the bus.
But you have to wait for Lotus now.
Well, how long is that gonna take?
I have, like, a million things to do.
What?
Not long.
What is so funny?
Sunny tell a knock-knock joke.
I'm telling you, I have a sneaking suspicion they're talking about me.
I think they've been calling me a dog.
How would you know?
You don't speak Korean.
Because this woman came in with a dog and Ruby calls the dog the same word they were saying when they were pointing at me.
You know, maybe in Korean, "dog" isn't an insult.
It could be like the word "fox" to us.
"Oh, she's a dog"!
Why don't you go to another nail shop?
Because they're the best, Jerry.
The best.
Look.
Maybe I'm just being paranoid.
What you need is a translator to go in with you and tell you what they're saying.
- Yeah, who speaks Korean?
- Do you know who speaks Korean?
- Who?
- George's father.
Oh, God, you've gotta be kidding me.
How does he speak Korean?
- He used to go there on business.
- What did he do?
Sold religious articles.
Statues of Jesus, the Virgin Mary, manufactured in Korea.
George, does your father speak Korean?
- Yeah, fluently.
- Really?
In fact, he once spoke to the Reverend Sun Myung Moon.
Thanks.
- Oh, hi, Gennice.
- Hey, Jerry.
You know George.
This is Kramer.
Nice to meet you.
- Playing today?
- No.
I'm a bench player.
Boy, they really stick to that understudy rule.
- So she's coming?
- Oh, yeah, she'll be here.
Guaranteed.
Oh, no.
My frankfurter.
My frankfurter fell.
Oh, no.
It was really good.
I can't believe that I dropped it.
It's okay.
It's just a hot dog.
Don't worry, everything's gonna be okay.
It was really good.
It's Bette!
Hi.
Hi.
Look, there she is.
It's Bette.
It's Bette.
Bette?
- Hi.
- Hi.
You know, I just wanna say I think you're wonderful.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
You know, I've seen you in everything you've done.
- Really?
- Anything I can get you?
A water?
- They got Italian ice over here.
- What flavors do they have?
Well, they've got chocolate, lemon and cherry.
- How about pineapple?
- Sure.
I'll be right back.
Thanks.
- One pineapple.
- No pineapple.
Just cherry, lemon and tutti-frutti.
All right.
Anyway, Mr. Costanza, what I want you to do is to go into the shop with me and tell me what they're saying.
You do speak Korean?
I once talked to the Reverend Sun Myung Moon.
He bought two Jesus statues from me.
He's a hell of a nice guy.
You ever seen that face on him?
It was like a big apple pie.
Yeah, yeah.
Listen, Mr. Costanza, if you do this for me I can get you a manicure.
I'll pay for it.
Or you can get a pedicure if you want.
No one's touching my feet.
Between you and me, Elaine, I think I got a foot-odor problem.
- Hold it up.
Time.
- Time.
- How you feeling?
- Pretty good.
Your arm feeling okay?
What's your problem?
Now, listen, she's all over the inside of the plate.
You know, she thinks she's a big star, thinks she owns the inside corner.
I say we back her off with a little chin music, you know I what mean?
I know what you mean.
Why don't you go back and play your position there.
Just trying to help.
I know what you're trying to do.
You're throwing off my rhythm.
Go get her.
Caught that, what is it, Beaches, on cable last night.
"Wind Beneath My Wings," huh?
Give me a break.
Hey, get some talent, then you can mouth off.
- Strike three.
- What, are you blind?
You stink.
- What's that?
- Nothing.
Nothing.
I had an affair with a Korean woman.
Mr. Costanza, I don't No, I feel I need to unburden myself.
I loved her very deeply but the clash of cultures was too much.
- Her family would not accept me.
- Mr. Costanza, I'm not sure Maybe it was because I refused to take off my shoes.
Again, the foot-odor problem.
The father would look at me and say: Which means, "This guy this is not my kind of guy.
" - Pineapple?
Sure, I got pineapple.
- Yeah, all right, okay.
Move in.
Move in, everybody.
Get your shrimp here.
Bigmouth shrimp on special today.
Come on, George, we just need one run.
Come on, George!
I got the pineapple!
I got the pineapple!
Keep going!
All the way!
- Come on, come on!
- Keep going.
Run, run!
- Safe.
- Yes!
Yes!
Oh, my God, Bette's hurt!
The understudy's boyfriend probably put him up to it.
That's his friend.
You're gonna pay for this.
Fellas, fellas, that was a clean play.
Come on, it's just a game.
It's just a game!
Oh, God!
Now, don't worry.
I'm with you.
Kramer's here.
Kramer is going to take care of everything.
Here, see?
I got your pineapple.
And I saw Beaches last night for the fourth time.
Our top story: The show will go on, but not Bette Midler.
While playing softball in the park, Ms. Midler was injured when another player thoughtlessly rammed her at home plate all captured on amateur videotape.
She'll be out for at least a week from her new Broadway show, Rochelle, Rochelle: The Musical.
Thank you.
- Well, we - No, please.
This is the first time in my life that anyone has ever done anything like this for me.
I've always had to struggle so hard for everything I ever got.
And for you two to do what you did I just know this is gonna be my big break.
It's okay.
Everything's gonna be all right.
Jerry.
Come on, Jerry, open up.
I know you're in there!
Kramer, come back another time.
Yeah.
So you're all in here together.
Well, how convenient.
I hope you're all very proud of yourselves.
So, my dear, you think you can get to Broadway.
Well, let me tell you something: Broadway has no room for people like you.
Not the Broadway I know.
My Broadway takes people like you and eats them up and spits them out.
My Broadway is the Broadway of Merman and Martin and Fontanne.
And if you think you can build yourself up by knocking other people down, good luck!
Hello, everyone.
Hi.
This is my friend Frank.
What would you like today?
Manicure?
Pedicure?
I'll take a manicure.
- I don't take my shoes off for anyone.
- Yeah, I know.
What's that?
What'd they say?
They made a derogatory comment about me.
- Okay, that's it.
- What?
Where's my tail?
I heard every word you said.
You got some nerve!
That voice.
It sounds so familiar.
It reminds me of when I was a young girl in Korea and I met an American businessman.
He was a very unusual man.
Quick-tempered, with a strange, halting way of speaking.
We fell in love.
But when I brought him home to meet my father he refused to take his shoes off, and there was a terrible fight.
This man also refuses to take his shoes off.
I've never seen people treated like this!
So you brought in a spy?
Now, take your dry, bitten nails and get out!
Frank?
Kim?
Yeah, right.
It's a turkey sandwich, a side of slaw.
- You want white or dark meat?
- White meat.
Yeah, white meat.
And if I see one piece of dark meat on there, it's your ass, buster.
Oh, get me one of those black-and-white cookies.
All right, yeah.
They don't have any, but don't worry.
I'm gonna get you one somewhere.
Good.
If I don't get a black-and-white cookie I'm not gonna be very pleasant to be around.
Now, that's impossible.
- Is there anything else I can do?
- I don't think so.
Well, can I do that for you?
All right, what the hell.
So, what's the scoop on Bob Barker?
Does he really give a damn about what those things cost or is he just acting?
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
I don't even know where I'm going.
Well, that's the best way to get someplace you've never been.
Yeah, I suppose that's true.
Have you been crying?
Yeah, see, this woman, this manicurist No, no, it doesn't matter why.
That's a very nice jacket.
Oh, thanks.
Very soft.
Huge button flaps cargo pockets, drawstring waist deep bi-swing vents in the back, perfect for jumping into a gondola.
How do you know all that?
That's my coat.
- You mean..
?
- Yes.
I'm J. Peterman.
I don't know why I have to go.
I didn't do anything to Bette.
Could you stop over here?
We're picking somebody up.
It's that understudy who put the hit on Bette!
Hey, I didn't do anything.
I was never informed.
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- That's not what they said in the paper.
You can all go straight to hell.
You see that?
Do you see what I'm going through?
So what?
Someone dropped an egg on my head as I went into my building last night.
I'm being heckled on-stage.
People are yelling out "Gillooly.
" Well, I'm having a little trouble with all this.
I mean, all I ever wanted to do is sing and now I'm the focus of this big media frenzy.
And none of the other actors in the show will even talk to me.
Stop your crying, will you.
- What?
- You heard him.
Don't you chime in.
You're the reason this happened.
Oh, yeah?
I read what you said to the papers yesterday.
How you weren't in on the planning.
What planning?
You think we planned this?
- How dare you say we planned this!
- Wait, I know you three.
You knocked Bette Midler out of Rochelle, Rochelle: The Musical.
I want you creeps out of my cab.
- I had nothing to do with it.
- Get out of my cab!
You should go to prison, eat prison food the rest of your life.
Get out.
Get out, each of you.
Each and every one of you, get out of my cab!
Then, in the distance, I heard the bulls and I began running as fast as I could.
Fortunately, I was wearing my Italian capto oxfords.
Sophisticated yet different, without making a huge fuss about it.
Rich, dark-brown calfskin leather.
Matching linen vamp.
Men's whole and half sizes, Oh, that's not too expensive.
I like that shirt.
Where did you get it?
This innocent-looking shirt has something which isn't innocent at all.
Touchability.
Heavy, silky, Italian cotton a fine, almost terrycloth-like feeling.
Five-button placket, relaxed fit.
Innocence and mayhem at once.
That's not bad.
So many years, Frank.
So many years.
If only you had taken your shoes off.
Couldn't, because I had a potential foot problem.
I thought maybe you had holes in your socks.
I wiped them for two minutes on the mat.
I don't know why your father made a case out of it.
Anyway, that's all in the past.
We have our whole future ahead of us.
Between you and me I think your country is placing a lot of importance on shoe removal.
You stopped short with me?
We don't do that in Korea.
Take me home!
I never want to see you again.
Hi.
Here.
I made this for you.
- What is it?
- It's Macaroni Midler!
- Macaroni Midler?
- Yeah, yeah.
- See how you're singing?
- Yeah.
- What's that from?
- That's a song from my show.
What do you think?
You are so freaking talented.
So look who's here.
- What do you want?
- We want to talk to her.
We want to apologize and tell her the whole thing was an accident.
No, I'm sorry, it's out of the question.
- What?
- Bette is recuperating right now and I'm not gonna allow anything to disturb her.
Who are you to decide?
I'm calling the shots around here so there won't be any more accidents.
- Hey, look, Kramer, don't you - I don't want her disturbed.
All right, we are gonna go find a security guard.
- What's wrong?
- I have a very bad feeling about this.
Yeah.
Wait a second.
What are you doing?
Where are you taking me?
There's only one place where I know you'll be safe.
Are you insane?
!
- Hello, Elaine.
- Oh, hi.
- We're so excited.
- Thank you so much.
Oh, you're welcome.
- See you inside.
- Okay.
What happened?
Well, I felt bad about the spying, so I got them tickets to the show.
That's nice.
All right, see you later.
Wait, wait, wait.
I didn't even get to tell you about my new job.
- Where?
- Writing for the J. Peterman catalog.
How did you get that?
I met him.
- You met J. Peterman?
- Yeah.
What is he like?
He wore a classic horseman's duster beige corduroy collar, Nine pockets, six on the outside.
Great for running alongside a train waving last goodbyes, posing on a veranda.
- Men's sizes small, medium, large - Yeah, I'll see you later.
- Well, break a leg tonight.
- I'm really nervous.
Here, you got a telegram.
Well, look who's here.
- Listen, buddy - What, are you gonna break my legs?
You don't scare me.
You or your goons.
How do you like that.
- What is it?
- My grandmother died.
- Oh, I'm so sorry - Oh, no, it's okay.
I'm fine.
So you don't cry when your grandmother dies but a hot dog makes you lose control?
Places, everyone!
- I gotta go on now.
- Good luck.
Ladies and gentlemen, at this evening's performance the part of Rochelle will be played by Gennice Graham.
- Gennice..
?
- Gennice Graham?
- What happened to Bette Midler?
- Oh, she got hurt.
No Bette Midler?
Wait, wait.
Hold it.
Stop!
I'm sorry, I have to start it over.
Look at my shoelace.
I can't do it like this.
Please let me start it over?
Please?
Please?
Your turn!
