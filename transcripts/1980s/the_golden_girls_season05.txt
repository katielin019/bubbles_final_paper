{START OF EPISODE 1}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see The biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say, "Thank you for being a friend" Oh, girls, let me tell you this wonderful idea I had.
When I was a little girl, my mama told me my destiny.
She said, "Peacock" - that was my nickname - Peacock.
"you are destined for great things".
Why "Peacock"?
Because I was so beautiful.
Anyway, she said I don't find peacocks so beautiful.
They've got skinny necks.
And they shriek.
It doesn't matter, Rose.
And they attack chickens.
I don't care about chickens, Rose.
She didn't call me "Chicken," she called me "Peacock".
You look more like a chicken.
When you're angry, your neck sticks out like a chicken.
Rose, it doesn't matter.
I was beautiful.
That was the point.
I was breathtaking.
Even more breathtaking than I am today.
But my beauty was not everything, my mama said.
My destiny was to be more than every man's passion.
She said my destiny was to be great.
She lied to you so you'd finish high school.
Well, now I know what my destiny is, Rose.
I'm gonna be a novelist.
A great romance novelist!
That is my destiny.
I shall become a great Southern writer, carrying on the tradition of the other great Southern writers like uh All those others so famous they need not be mentioned.
Oh, girls, it's gonna be so exciting.
I am gonna make a fortune.
And I won't even have to use my imagination.
My life is a romance novel.
Your life is a sports page.
Listen.
Tell me I can't do better than this in my sleep.
"He grabbed her.
"She could feel his fingers pressing into her moist flesh.
"Her heart was pounding, her loins on fire.
As he spun her around, her dress ripping open" You know how many times I've experienced that?
Your loins have been on fire?
Yes.
"She melted" Where exactly are your loins?
Rose, it doesn't matter.
Just listen.
"She melted into his arms, faint now with the animal musk of him".
I didn't know people had loins.
I've heard of loin of pork, but In her case, the same thing.
Dorothy, you want to hear my idea?
You won't believe it.
Sorry, Blanche, I can't.
What's the matter, Dorothy?
Oh, I don't know what to do.
I just don't know.
I was in front of the class and I couldn't talk.
I was too tired to talk.
Not that they would have listened.
They were too busy sniffing the whiteout they'd stolen from typing class.
I had to excuse them early.
I mean, I just cannot get rid of this flu.
And it keeps getting worse, not better.
But it's been months now.
Maybe it's not the flu.
Flu doesn't last that long.
You ought to go back to Dr. Raymond.
I did, Blanche.
He said I'm fine.
Get a second opinion.
She did.
She went to Dr. Schlesinger.
Well, then, you are fine.
Now, you want to hear my idea?
She is not fine, Blanche.
Look at her.
I didn't say she looks fine.
I said she was fine.
She looks like hell.
Thank you, Blanche.
Oh, you know, I think in my novel, my heroine will be sick.
Tragically sick, but snatched back from death by a doctor with the hands of a peasant and the soul of a poet.
Oh, my God, I'm writing already.
Somebody take this down.
What is she talking about?
Forget her.
Dorothy, you've got to see another doctor.
Raymond is not a specialist.
Yeah, but what kind of specialist do I need?
Well, just call up Dr. Raymond and ask him.
He'll refer you.
You have to, honey.
You're getting sicker and sicker.
Just like my heroine.
Sicker and sicker.
Though, of course, my heroine doesn't look like you.
This is a romantic novel, not science fiction.
Remind me when I feel better to kick the crap out of her.
Sorry to keep you waiting, Lorraine, but there was something I had to take care of.
No, I'm not Lorraine.
You're not Lorraine Maslansky?
No.
Really?
Because I have her chart here.
Hand me my purse.
I'll check my driver's license.
I'm sorry.
Then you must be Oh, Dorothy.
Right, of course.
OK, we have Dorothy here.
Right.
Sorry to keep you waiting, Dorothy, but there was something I had to take care of.
That's all right.
A famous person - very, very famous.
But I can't tell you who it is.
Ethics - you know, we have to be quite careful about that.
But if this was Win, Lose or Draw, I'd draw a crown.
What?
That was a hint.
Oh, oh.
Do you have my test results?
Sure do.
And?
A king.
But that's it.
No more clues.
My lips are sealed.
Oh, come on, come on.
Think about it.
I don't care who it is.
It could be the king of England.
I don't care.
No, no.
England doesn't have a king.
Try Saudi Arabia.
Look, all I can think about are my test results and how to keep this gown closed.
Well, don't worry about it.
You won't be needing it.
Dorothy, get dressed.
You're fine.
I beg your pardon?
We've run every test known to man.
They're all normal.
You can get dressed, go home, enjoy your life.
Dr. Stevens, I was always healthy, and then I came down with this flu.
I can't get rid of it.
I've been sick for five months now.
I have a constant sore throat, swollen glands, fevers.
My muscles ache and are weak.
I am totally exhausted all the time.
I know, I know.
You told me.
Well, maybe it bears repeating.
Maybe you still think I'm Lorraine Maslansky.
Look, Dorothy, can I ask you a personal question?
Yes.
You're divorced?
Yes.
How's your social life?
Do you see men?
What in the world does seeing men have to do with anything?
Well, Dorothy, we know for a fact that if people are not happy - and lonely people aren't - they get all kinds of symptoms.
Depression, fatigue Symptoms very much like the ones you describe.
Look, Dr. Stevens, I don't think you understand, so I'm gonna tell you again.
I am at a point now where I am so exhausted that sometimes I cannot speak, literally cannot speak.
There are days when I can't get out of bed.
I Raising my arms to wash my hair in the shower is too exhausting for me.
I can't even do that.
I have heart palpitations.
I can't concentrate.
I forget things.
I I get confused.
Look, Dorothy, I don't believe you're sick, but you do.
You want to pursue this, you want to spend more money, that's fine with me.
So, go to New York and see the man I studied with.
He's the best neurologist there is.
I don't know anyone better.
If you have anything, anything at all, he'll find it.
Two and a half hours!
I thought you'd died.
What's wrong with you?
Nothing.
Who are you?
I'm the doctor.
We'll see about that.
Look, Mrs Petrillo.
I'm Dorothy's mother, and I want to know what's wrong with her.
And don't tell me nothing.
I know there's something wrong with her.
Mothers know.
Look, Ma, I'll talk to you about it later.
Your daughter is fine, Mrs Petrillo.
Tiptop?
Tiptop.
Then, Mr. 100% Tiptop, why the hell does she feel like hell?
Look, Ma Wait, I gotta hear this.
It could be functional.
Functional?
Mental.
Mental!
Well, let me tell you something, Mr. 100% Tiptop Mental.
My daughter may be no spring chicken, and her jaw might crack when she chews and she may have noticeable trouble digesting raw vegetables, but one thing she's not is mental.
Thanks, Ma.
Ribs, great.
Why don't you just kick the dentures out of my mouth?
We never had a barbecue in St. Olaf after the tragedy.
I guess we have to ask.
No, we don't.
She'll work it in anyway.
What tragedy, Rose?
I can't talk about it.
Fine.
Good.
But it had to do with barbecuing elk, a big fire and someone who lost his balance.
Got it.
Clear as a bell.
Well, now I know why Hemingway killed himself.
Oh, girls, I have writer's block.
It is the worst feeling in the world.
Try ten days without a bowel movement sometime.
You just sit there hour after hour after hour.
Tell me about it.
I just don't know what to do.
I don't think there's any worse feeling in the world than facing that blank piece of paper.
Tell me, how much have you written so far?
Well, that's just it.
Nothing.
That's how I know I have writer's block.
Blanche, you have to have written to have writer's block.
Otherwise, all of us have it.
Dorothy, maybe I ought to go to New York with you.
New York is a writer's city.
I could hang out at the Algonquin, talk to my colleagues, get the juices going.
Honey, I'm going just for two days to see a doctor.
I've asked Rose to go with me.
Rose?
Why her?
She's comforting.
And I'm not?
You told me you were having a pedicure when your husband was dying.
Well, of course I was, Sophia.
It was the third Thursday of the month.
If I'd cancelled, that would have been it for July and August when I'd be wearing open-toed sandals.
Angel of mercy.
Well, I didn't know he was gonna pick that precise hour to die.
How could I know that?
Well, he was in a coma.
Oh, he'd been in a coma for days.
The fact is, I happen to be very good with sick people.
I was once a candy stripper.
That's "striper".
Whatever.
You know, a volunteer.
Oh, Dorothy, I want to go to New York.
How come Rose gets to go?
Blanche, whenever I don't feel well, Rose makes me feel OK.
What is she?
Your best friend?
Rose knows I'm sick.
Well, I know you're sick.
God knows you tell me all the time.
What a waste.
Rose Nylund in New York.
It's gonna be a great trip.
You wait and see.
You're gonna be cured.
And I'm gonna get to see the Big Potato.
I said she was comforting.
I didn't say she was smart.
So, what are you doing here?
You've seen everybody.
Nobody found anything wrong with you.
And between their workups and mine, there are no more tests to run.
Yeah, but I know Look, Mrs. Zbornak.
Your main complaint is you're tired.
I get tired too.
It's called getting old.
Dr. Budd, that's not what this is.
I am sick.
I've had to give up my job because I was too tired to do it.
How'd you get here?
I flew.
No, to my office.
A taxi.
And from the taxi?
What, how did I get from the taxi to your office?
Not a hard question.
I walked.
Right.
You walked.
You're not sick, Dorothy.
The people I see can't walk.
They can't swallow.
Some of them can't breathe.
Look, don't take this the wrong way, but have you ever thought about seeing a psychiatrist?
I have seen two.
Here are their letters.
They both say there is nothing psychologically wrong with me.
They believe it is physical.
What the hell do they know?
Psychiatry's not a science.
Then why did you suggest I see one?
Because what you have is not scientific.
What else was I going to do?
Send you to New Mexico to a shaman?
There's nothing wrong with you, Dorothy, except what happens to all of us.
In case you haven't noticed, you're not 30.
Take a cruise, Dorothy.
Go to a hypnotist.
Change your hair color.
My wife became a blonde.
She's a new woman.
Yes, room service?
Hello, this is Rose Nylund, and I'm staying here in your lovely hotel.
Well, I think I need a new menu.
Mine seems to be full of mistakes.
For example, it says a small glass of tomato juice is six dollars.
I see.
Oh, room service, I'll have to call you back.
Dorothy, what happened?
Tell me, what did he say?
Nothing.
He said exactly what everyone else did.
Oh, no.
That's terrible.
Oh, Dorothy, I am so sorry.
I thought surely he'd find something, so that you'd at least have a name for this thing.
Oh, let's not talk about that.
Tell me about your day.
Oh, forget about my day.
He didn't say anything new?
Nothing.
Come on, now.
What did you do?
You've never been here before.
What do you think?
I don't know how people live here, Dorothy.
I mean, it's all very interesting, and everything in the world is here, but it's so tall and so crowded and so noisy and so much.
I've never seen so much of everything in my whole life.
I went to Bloomingdale's - the store.
I swear St. Olaf could fit into it.
I went to the top of the Empire State Building.
You know what I don't understand?
How come the fall didn't kill King Kong instantly?
I mean, sure, he was big, but that's 102 stories.
You look down  I know, it was a sad movie.
I cried too.
Every time I see it I hope, "Maybe this time it'll be different.
Maybe this time he won't die".
But he always does.
It was only a movie, Dorothy.
That was really a fake gorilla.
Oh, Rose, that's not it.
Well, what is it, Dorothy?
What happened?
Oh Maybe I am crazy.
Nobody believes me.
Everybody thinks I'm crazy.
Maybe I am.
Maybe I'm really crazy.
Oh, Dorothy, you are not crazy.
I mean, you are absolutely not crazy.
I've seen the way you walk.
I've seen how wiped out you get.
You're not crazy, honey.
You're sick.
I think so too.
I really do, but nobody believes me.
Doctors don't know everything, Dorothy.
You're right.
I mean, they think they do, but they don't.
You're right.
I mean, after all, Dr. Seuss was a doctor too.
I'm gonna finish it tonight.
I don't care if I never sleep a wink.
It's just like giving birth, Rose.
Once you get started, you can't stop.
Actually, you can, Blanche.
Ingrid Thurman stopped.
What was she writing?
She wasn't.
She was giving birth to Hans and Franz, the twins.
And she stopped right in the middle, right after Hans.
Well, what happened to Franz?
He stayed in.
For how long?
I don't know.
A long time.
They were a year apart in school.
That's impossible, Rose.
No, it isn't.
How is she?
Wiped out and depressed, even though she tries to hide it.
Oh, Sophia, she's gonna be OK, I know it.
She will be, Sophia.
Now, she's tough.
You know, there are all sorts of things that people get that they can't diagnose.
And then they disappear just as mysteriously as they came.
Gustav Ljungqvist got sick from something mysterious, and he nearly died.
Well, he did die, in fact.
Then at the cemetery, Beatrice Ljungqvist - his wife - kept screaming, "He's alive, he's alive!
I can hear him from the grave"!
Well, everybody thought it was the hallucinations of a grieving widow, so they sedated her.
But when she woke up from her sedation, she told them that he said, from the grave, "We never paid our '78 through '86 income taxes".
And his partner said, "Only Gustav would know that.
He must be alive".
So they all raced to the cemetery, and the entire town started digging like crazy - kneeling by the grave, using their hands even, dirt flying and Beatrice screaming - and when they opened that coffin, there he was, dead as a doornail.
What is the point of that ridiculous story, Rose?
The point is Gustav didn't die from his mysterious disease at all.
He lived and recovered.
Trouble was, he recovered while he was buried, so by the time they got to him, he'd died of suffocation.
I just don't believe these stories you tell, Rose.
The other tragic aspect was the IRS was waiting at the cemetery to arrest Gustav's partner, Bergstrom.
So Bergstrom killed himself right then and there, by grabbing the gun from Sheriff Tokvisten and shooting himself.
What they did then was, since the grave was still open, and everybody was right there, and Gustav and Bergstrom had been partners, so they put Bergstrom in with Gustav and had a double burial.
Unfortunately, later they found out that Bergstrom wanted to be cremated.
Oh, shut up, Rose!
I think the worst thing in the world is if your child dies before you do.
Sophia, Dorothy is not going to die.
I know that.
She'll be fine.
I know.
Why do you do that, Rose?
Why do you make up stories?
It wouldn't feel right to live anymore, you know?
If a kid dies, it wouldn't feel fair to live.
Sophia, Dorothy's not dying.
How do you know, Rose?
I know.
Oh, now, honey, she's right.
I know too, and I'm a writer.
I see things more clearly than the average person.
My perceptions are keener.
Oh, knock it off, Blanche.
Sophia, we have all seen our husbands die.
We know what that is.
Except for her.
She was getting a manicure.
Pedicure.
Well, I'm 80-something, and I've seen more death and dying than any of you.
Over the past five months, we've seen a perfectly healthy, energetic woman waste away.
She can't do anything anymore.
So what difference does it make that they don't have a name for it yet?
It's still something.
There were lots of diseases they didn't have a name for.
You think they had a name for the Black Plague when one guy had it?
Thousands had to die before they knew what it was.
Dorothy could be dying, and they just don't know it.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend"  On the last episode of "The Golden Girls" I have heart palpitations.
I can't concentrate.
I forget things.
I I get confused.
Well, now I know what my destiny is, Rose.
I'm gonna be a novelist.
Dorothy, I don't believe you're sick, but you do.
Girls, I have writer's block.
It is the worst feeling in the world.
Try ten days without a bowel movement sometime.
Everybody thinks I'm crazy.
Maybe I am.
There's nothing wrong with you, Dorothy, except what happens to all of us.
In case you haven't noticed, you're not 30.
Dorothy could be dying and they just don't know it.
Dorothy, Dorothy.
Don't smash the Play-Doh.
Sorry.
Well, as far as doctors go, you've certainly seen the best.
The best don't exist anymore.
The best are dead.
Well, I don't know about that.
Oh.
You're the exception, Harry.
I didn't mean you.
So do you think I'm crazy too?
Dorothy, I think you're very sane.
Just because a doctor hasn't found something doesn't mean there isn't something there.
Are you serious?
How come you know that and they don't?
First of all, I know you.
You're a stable person.
If you say you're sick, you probably are sick.
Now, I want you to see Michael Chang.
He's a virologist on staff here at the hospital.
There are all kinds of diseases we didn't know about before.
Look at Lyme disease.
Harry, am I gonna die?
I'm afraid so.
Do you really think so?
Sooner or later, I guarantee it.
Unless, of course, the Japanese come up with something.
There you go.
Here's his name and number.
My God, what handwriting doctors have.
I can't even read this, and I just wrote it Here it is.
Thank you, Oliver.
How are you gonna know it's not chicken soup?
We don't keep chicken soup here.
We only have vegetable soup.
If that looks like vegetable soup, you're in a lot of trouble.
How are you gonna know it's mine?
Because I'll put your name on it.
How old are you?
Too old for you.
Has he been your doctor ever since you were little?
He's not my doctor.
He's my friend.
Oh.
Oh, Oliver, Oliver!
The bottle, please.
Thank you.
Listen, Harry.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I can't tell you what it means to have someone like you believe me.
Give me that.
That's not his.
He had Buddy Kline do it for him.
This is a proxy?
He'll do it in his own bed, but there's something about doing it in a public place.
Kinda like sex.
Maybe where you come from.
Rose, what the hell are you doing?
I'm making omelets for us without yolk so we don't get too much cholesterol.
That leaves these yolks, which I hate to throw out, so I thought we'd give them to the homeless.
Fine.
Give them egg yolks.
They'll die of heart attacks.
They won't need homes.
Your heart's in the right place, Rose, but I don't know where the hell your brain is.
Morning.
Oh, Dorothy, you look terrific.
Where are you going?
To see that specialist that Harry recommended.
Wipe off your makeup.
What?
You look too healthy.
Maybe that's why they don't believe you.
You don't look sick.
She should go.
They'd believe her.
Blanche, you look terrible.
What day is this?
I've been up for 72 hours.
I had a breakthrough.
I discovered a new form of writing.
I will go down in history.
First I wrote all day, then I tore it all up, and then that night it came to me, and the words poured forth like liquid from a stream.
It was almost a mystical experience.
Somebody else was writing this.
Who?
Everyman.
This is everyman's work.
It's all gold.
Just open it anywhere and the magic will touch you.
But I'm so tired.
I must sleep.
And I cannot sleep.
I am too tired to sleep.
I will never sleep again.
I may die from this.
What am I gonna do?
My God, I'm hallucinating.
I see little balls of sunshine in a bag.
Does this mean something?
Those are egg yolks, Blanche.
My brain's gone.
My body is limp with exhaustion.
I suppose all the greats knew this feeling.
And the thing is, after all this I've decided not to sell my book.
It's too good to sell.
They can publish it after I'm dead, like Vincent van Gogh.
Van Gogh was a painter, Blanche.
Whatever.
It's all the same thing.
We're all artists.
We're all misunderstood.
He cut off his hair.
Maybe I'll cut off mine.
He cut off his ear.
I have too many earrings.
We gotta go.
I hate to leave.
I've never seen a show like this before.
Good luck, Dorothy.
I hope he finds something wrong with you.
Oh, I don't mean something wrong wrong.
I mean something wrong so you know you're right when you know there's something wrong and you haven't been wrong all along.
My God, I can't even understand people when they speak anymore, I'm so tired.
What'd she just say, Dorothy?
Was that a poem?
Rose, make her lie down.
I do try.
I try, but I just pop right up again like one of those clowns you hit.
I'll never rest.
I'll never rest again.
Have a good time, Dorothy.
Buy me a present.
I'll make you some nice hot milk and then we're gonna pile you into bed.
Rose, you're my friend so I'm gonna let you read a few pages, but you have to give me your word you won't tell anyone.
Your word.
Of course.
And then will you sleep?
Whatever.
I can trust you, I know I can.
You're from Minnesota.
People from Minnesota are honest.
They don't lie.
What could you possibly find to lie about on a farm?
Must be some state.
Lots of lakes and nice, pale people.
I'd drown myself.
Read, Rose.
Don't talk.
I must publish a guide to go with my book.
It's too full of references people could not possibly understand.
It will be taught in universities.
Rose, what is this?
Yellow eyeballs are staring at me.
Those are egg yolks, Blanche.
Blanche, you are exhausted.
You have to sleep.
To sleep, perchance to dream.
My God, what a wonderful line.
Oh!
I'm getting so good I can't stand it.
I ought to write that in my book, that line.
What do you think, Rose?
What page are you on?
To tell the truth, I don't understand any of this.
It doesn't seem to make any sense.
Doesn't make sense?
Since when are you a literary critic, Rose Nylund?
I'm not.
You're from Minnesota.
What have you read, for God's sake?
Silas Marner?
Paul Bunyan?
Nothing.
You know nothing.
People from Minnesota are considered well-read if they get through the Sears catalog.
Give me back my book.
This is why Hollywood won't get it either.
I will not have my words coming out of Glenn Close's mouth.
I'd rather die.
Come on, Blanche.
We're gonna get you to bed.
But it's my duty to the public.
No, I must have it published.
It's my duty.
Oh, my God, I'm so tired.
Come on, you can sleep right here, honey.
Tell me a story, Rose.
That always puts me to sleep.
It works every time.
Just tell me one of your boring stories.
OK.
I want you to know I'm crazy about Chinese people.
Ma.
It's a compliment.
I am.
Thank you, Mrs. Petrillo.
Chinese people revere the elderly.
In this country we throw away anything that's old.
But you people don't.
That's a beautiful thing.
You also have the most gorgeous hair in the world.
Even when it's humid.
Ma, please, let Dr. Chang read.
It's OK, Mrs. Zbornak.
I'm finished.
You've seen some wonderful doctors, but I really can't agree with their findings.
There are new diseases arising all the time - things we don't necessarily have tests for - but that doesn't mean the diseases don't exist.
See how terrific the Chinese are?
With the most terrific food.
Tasty, but not fattening.
I don't care what anyone says.
I don't get hungry an hour later.
Ma, let Dr. Chang finish.
I love Chinese checkers.
It's much better than plain checkers.
And chopsticks - what a great idea.
Who knows what fork to use at a dinner party?
Chopsticks, you don't feel like an idiot.
Ma, enough!
Dr. Chang, please.
Well, I think that you are sick.
I think you have something called chronic fatigue syndrome.
It's fairly recent.
There are many theories, but most of us believe it's a virus.
It just has not been identified yet.
The man's a genius.
By the way, I loved Flower Drum Song.
Doctors just kept telling me I was depressed.
Depression can make a person feel tired, but it doesn't start suddenly, give you swollen glands, sore throat and all the other symptoms.
Now, there are certain blood tests, which we'll do, and if those results are abnormal that combined with the exclusion of the other diseases will compose a profile that actually thousands of people fit.
So I really have something real?
I would say you most certainly do.
We should have our answers in a couple of weeks.
How long will it last?
I mean, will it go away?
Does it get worse?
Does anyone die from it?
Well, no one has died from it.
We don't know how long it lasts.
Some people recover in months, some still have it after ten years, but that happens in other diseases as well.
You take multiple sclerosis.
Some people have 20-year remissions, others wind up in wheelchairs.
There are variations.
You're a genius.
All your people are brilliant.
The Chinese invented pasta, you know.
We take credit for it, but we just added oregano.
Well All I can say at this point is try to adapt to it.
Rest when you need to, eat well, eliminate stress if you can.
Right now there is no cure, and no one thing that relieves symptoms in everyone.
Right now I'm afraid you'll just have to live with it.
Oh, why didn't they tell me, all those doctors I saw?
I'm sure some of them weren't familiar with it.
The ones who have heard about it sometimes have trouble believing it exists, since they're not able to see it under their microscopes just yet.
Those colleagues of mine, unfortunately, tend to blame the victim.
I can't tell you what a relief this is.
I'm sure.
Are there any other questions that I could answer for you?
Not now, not that I can think of.
Maybe later.
Right now I can't even think straight.
If there are no more questions, I'll order some blood work I have a question.
Of course, Mrs. Petrillo.
When I order at Fung Chow's and say no MSG, do they really put it in anyway?
I don't believe it.
Another rejection.
And this one isn't even personal.
It's a form letter.
They just filled in my name at the top, see?
Oh, I'm so upset.
I put everything into this, Rose, all of me, I held nothing back.
Then to have some snotnosed little kid from Harvard send me a form letter, oh!
I'm so mad I could scream.
That's the first time I ever heard anybody say "I'm so mad I could scream" and actually do it.
It's like saying, "I laughed all the way to the bank".
I never saw anybody do that either.
I did all this work, Rose.
I worked so hard.
Oh, I know you did, Blanche.
All I ever wanted was to be special.
I thought this would do it.
I thought I'd publish a novel and I'd be special.
'Course, I've always been special because of my looks, but they won't last forever.
I have to be realistic - another 20 or 30 years.
My face and body might start to go and then I'll have nothing to make me special.
That's not what makes a person special, Blanche.
You're special because you're a kind, decent, loving individual with a wonderful heart and a beauty that comes from your soul.
That's that Minnesota crap again about the meaning of life.
Well, Blanche, what else is there besides love and kindness?
How about fame and fortune?
That doesn't bring happiness.
Like hell it doesn't.
You know, I'm getting sick of you knocking Minnesota.
Maybe we're not as sophisticated as Miami, maybe we don't have French boutiques and valet parking and face-lifts for Christmas vacation, but we have friends and family and a sense of community and caring, and that's pretty special.
And our people are special too.
And if we have farms, that's great.
Without farms, you couldn't eat, and without eating, you wouldn't be able to go on a diet, and if you couldn't do that, what would you do for the rest of your life?
Was I harsh?
Ladies, drinks?
Champagne.
The best you have.
Dorothy, that's so expensive.
Shut up, Rose.
This is my treat.
It is a celebration.
What are we celebrating?
My daughter found out she has a debilitating disease.
Oh!
And it has a name.
I am thrilled.
We all are.
Well, of course.
Congratulations.
Champagne it is.
I can't tell you what a relief it is to just be sick, not sick and crazy, and to know what I have, and that a lot of other people have the same thing.
I don't like the name.
I think it ought to have a better name.
That's what Dr. Chang said.
Chronic fatigue syndrome makes it sound like I'm just a tired person when it is so much more than that.
I think they should name it after you.
Zbornak syndrome.
Zbornak syndrome.
That sounds like a chess move.
Devereaux's disease has a nice ring to it.
Oh, my God.
Oh, it was just a thought.
It's him.
Who?
I can't believe it.
I saw him first.
Who is it?
Where is he?
It's Dr. Budd, the neurologist I saw in New York.
The one who told me I was just getting old and to go see a psychiatrist.
Dorothy, don't make a scene.
Order without me.
Dr. Budd?
Yes.
You probably don't remember me, but you told me I wasn't sick.
Do you remember?
You told me I was just getting old.
I'm sorry.
I really don't Remember.
Maybe you're getting old.
That's a little joke.
Well, I tell you, Dr. Budd, I really am sick.
I have chronic fatigue syndrome.
That is a real illness.
You can check with the Center for Disease Control.
Oh, well, I'm sorry about that.
Well, I'm glad.
At least I know I have something.
I'm sure.
Well, nice seeing you.
Not so fast.
There are some things I have to say.
There are a lot of things that I have to say.
Words can't express what I have to say.
What I went through, what you put me through I can't do this in a restaurant.
Good.
But I will.
Lewis, who is this person?
Look, miss Sit.
I sat for you long enough.
Dr. Budd, I came to you sick - sick and scared.
And you dismissed me.
You didn't have the answer.
Instead of saying, "I'm sorry.
I don't know what's wrong with you," you made me feel crazy, like I had made it all up.
You dismissed me.
You made me feel like a child, a fool, a neurotic who was wasting your precious time.
Is that is that your caring profession?
Is that healing?
No one deserves that kind of treatment, Dr. Budd, no one.
I suspect, had I been a man, I might have been taken a little bit more seriously and not told to go to a hairdresser.
Look, I am not going to sit here anymore-- Shut up, Lewis.
I don't know where you doctors lose your humanity, but you lose it.
If all of you at the beginning of your careers could get very sick and scared for a while, you'd probably learn more from that than anything else.
You'd better start listening to your patients.
They need to be heard.
They need caring, they need compassion.
They need attending to.
Someday, Dr. Budd, you're gonna be on the other side of the table, and as angry as I am, and as angry as I always will be, I still wish you a better doctor than you were to me.
Are you all right?
I feel better than I have felt in a long time.
To my friends who made being sick a little easier because they cared.
Oh!
This is the best champagne I've ever tasted.
It should be.
It's $430 a bottle.
Rose, I can't afford that!
You did say the best.
Rose, for heaven's sake, you should have told me what it was.
Ma, what am I gonna do?
Just calm down.
I'll show you an old Sicilian trick.
This is how I grew up poor and managed to eat in the best restaurants in all of Italy.
Watch.
Look, learn.
It's awful!
Swill!
Is there a problem?
You're supposed to take off your socks before you step on the grapes.
Taste this.
Oh, dear.
Ladies, I'm terribly sorry.
I'll get you a new bottle.
No, no.
It lingers on the palate.
We won't be able to drink champagne for weeks.
Well, at least let us pay for your meal.
If you insist.
Thank you.
Now it's a celebration!
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see The biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Morning.
Oh, you've already got breakfast ready.
Becky and I were up till all hours talking.
You know, my daughter and I haven't had a talk like that since ever.
It must've been fun.
Oh, yeah.
We did each other's hair and laughed and laughed.
I can see why.
Ma, why are you still here?
You were supposed to have your checkup with Dr. Siegel this morning.
Oh, you didn't hear about Dr. Siegel.
Hear what?
I'm not going.
Ma, you are impossible.
Now, this is the third appointment you've missed.
At my age, checkups can be dangerous to your health.
You know Sam down the block, the one who thinks he's hiding his stomach by wearing Hawaiian shirts?
Yeah, Sam is fine.
His brother went for a checkup seven years ago.
The doctor said he was great.
Three days after the exam, he was dead.
Ma, he owed money to a guy named Face and got thrown off a pier.
That was one of the causes.
I'm not going.
You're going.
Rose, could you give me a hand?
Oh, sure.
If you will excuse me, Becky and I are having breakfast on the lanai.
We're still bonding.
Dorothy, how come we never bond?
We're from before bonding and quality time.
We're from when people stayed together because they had no choice.
Ma, would I be insisting on this checkup if I didn't care about you?
Why can't we just do each other's hair like Blanche and her daughter?
Oh, look, Ma.
I know you're scared.
I'll go with you.
Look, when I was little, didn't you make me go and get all my shots?
I had to lie to you and tell you we were going on the pony rides, and you fell for it time after time.
Just like Pavlov's dog, only dumber.
OK, OK, Ma, if you don't wanna go to the doctor, you don't have to go to the doctor.
All right?
I'll tell you what.
Why don't we spend tomorrow afternoon together?
We'll work on our bonding.
I'll take you to Wolfie's for an egg cream.
A chocolate egg cream?
You betcha.
Oh, boy!
A chocolate egg cream!
Forget it, Dorothy.
I smell a pony ride.
Oh, you know, I think this is the best visit we've ever had.
I think it's because you've realized I'm a grown woman.
Well, I never thought the day would come, but we are finally the same age.
Why don't you stay longer?
Oh, Mama.
I can't stay because We're telling each other everything, right?
Everything.
No more secrets.
Oh, good.
Mama Mm-hmm?
I'm getting impregnated on Monday.
I've decided the best thing for me is to go to a sperm bank and get artificially inseminated.
Why would you do something like this?
Just to hurt me?
Mama, try to understand.
I can't pass a carriage without looking in.
I heard my biological clock ticking so loudly, it was keeping me up at night.
A baby should be doing that.
Well, why don't you wait till you get married?
I don't wanna get married.
Well, then at least wait until I'm dead.
You really mean that?
Yes, I do.
And wait until all my friends are dead, too.
The last thing I need is whispering at my funeral.
I can't believe you're reacting like this.
We got so close this past week, I thought I could tell you anything.
Anything but this.
Well, Mama, I'm gonna do this whether you like it or not.
Oh.
Oh, I see, missy.
So, this is the thanks I get for all those cold nights when you were a baby crying and I'd have to get up out of bed and grope around in the dark for my slippers and robe, make my way all the way downstairs and scream for the governess?
Hungry or suicidal?
It's not easy being the mother of a child with her own free will.
I knew I felt the refrigerator open.
What's wrong?
You've been upset all day.
It's Rebecca.
I just don't understand.
Why didn't somebody tell me it was dinnertime?
Ma, it's not dinner, it's the middle of the night.
Good, then I'm dressed for it.
Blanche is upset.
Well, you would be too, if your daughter Oh, I can't even say it.
What could have happened?
The two of you were getting so close.
My little girl is gonna have a baby by artificial insemination.
I just can't bear to think about it.
I'm just being silly, aren't I?
For God's sake, somebody say something!
Eww.
Big help.
Dorothy, what about you?
You're always the sensible one around here, the free, modern thinker who keeps up with the times.
Now, what do you think?
Eww.
No wonder I'm up in the middle of the night working my way through the cheese keeper.
Thank God I don't have the thighs of a normal woman.
I tried to talk her out of it.
She says she has thought it through and there is no changing her mind.
Well, it might not be so bad.
In fact, just last week I was reading that you can buy the sperm of Nobel Prize winners.
Or was it Star Search winners?
Buy?
Well, sperm used to be free.
It was all over the place.
On the farm a lot of the animals got artificially inseminated.
Once Harry the bull went through a whole spring unaroused and the cows and my father were out of their minds with grief.
I mean, you haven't seen anything till you've seen a frustrated cow.
They can get this crazed look in their eye and you know they're thinking, "Where's mine"?
"Where's mine"?
Cows have feelings, too.
Anyway, when Harry really got lazy Dad had to bring in Mr. Hoffenheisen to spread the seed.
He did it in the most unusual way.
He'd put on this really long rubber glove.
Rose, that's a terrific story and surprisingly on-subject but I don't think that Blanche wants to hear about uncontented cows right now.
It's not that I mind becoming a young grandmother again.
Nobody believes it anyway.
Please.
It's just that it seems so unnatural.
No daddy for the baby.
And no fun trying.
I'm gonna have to agree with Blanche on this one.
Half the fun is in getting there.
And boy, did your father and I have fun trying for you.
Ma, I don't think I wanna hear this.
I wasn't gonna tell you until you're 60, but I think you can handle it now.
We lived in New York at the time and there was the San Genarro festival every year.
And your father, may he rest in peace until I get there, got so turned on by the festivities one year he couldn't wait till we got home.
Oh, Ma So he took me right there behind the sausage and pepper stand.
Hey, we were behind the garbage cans.
It's not like we were in front of everybody.
I can relate to the festivities part, Sophia.
All our children were conceived on special St. Olaf holidays.
Adam was conceived on the Day of the Princess Pig when they had the pig crowning, and Jeanella was conceived on Hay Day.
That's the day we St. Olafians celebrate hay.
Rose, do you think you could wrap this up before Rebecca goes into labor?
Then there was the Day of the Wheat when everybody came to town dressed as sandwiches.
Charlie and I forgot to put cheese between us and before I knew it, there was Kirsten.
Look, Blanche, what Rebecca is doing is really not so terrible.
I mean, look, among the four of us, each of us conceived our children in a different way.
I was totally unconscious.
When I came to, there was Stan, carving a notch in his dashboard.
I never bought that unconscious story.
I swear.
He must've slipped me something.
Apparently.
But at least what we all did was natural.
Well, not all the time.
There's some other stuff, but I probably shouldn't tell you till you're 70.
Hi.
Oh, hi, Becky.
Have you seen my mother?
She mentioned something about having a headache.
I think she's in her room.
Hanging herself.
Oh, hi, everybody.
Oh, how are you feeling?
Oh, much better.
Say, how about going out to dinner?
Have some fun.
Mama, can we talk for a minute?
I'll make the reservations.
Where would you like to eat?
I want you to be part of the process.
Oh, Becky.
Honey, I think you are headed for trouble, going off by yourself like this.
No man is gonna want to marry you with a baby.
Blanche, there are a lot of people who are single parents and they're doing just fine.
Yeah, look at me.
The right man could be just around the corner.
And he may not be.
I may turn around a dozen corners and not find anyone.
So, instead of trying, you're just gonna give up and do this crazy baby thing?
"Crazy baby thing"?
What I am doing, Mother, is taking control of my life and having the family I need.
Well, I would certainly never have a baby artificially and I do not approve of you doing it either!
Well, if that's the way you want it, Mama, then you're gonna lose me and your grandchild.
Ah, there you are.
Ma, I scheduled the appointment for your checkup.
Ma, you know you have to have a physical.
What do you want me to do?
Take you to court?
Have you declared incompetent?
I'm not incompetent.
Once when I laughed too hard, I had a little accident.
Can I fix you some breakfast, honey?
No, thanks.
Oh, I just feel terrible.
If I'm gonna spend the night tossing and turning at least I wanna wake up smelling like aftershave.
Morning.
Good morning, Rebecca.
I got up early and did some research.
There's a sperm bank not far from here.
How convenient.
No kidding.
Do they have a drive-up window?
I thought, Mama, that we could go down there and once you see these places are legitimate, you won't be so upset.
I don't want to go to a place like that.
It's too embarrassing.
What if one of the neighbors saw me going in?
What would they think?
That you're picking something up for a much younger person.
Mama, please.
It's really important to me.
Blanche, would it help if I were to go with you?
Well I'll come too.
I'll bring my camera.
It's never too soon to start a baby book.
Oh, boy, we're going to a sperm bank.
I can't think of a better way to pep up a slow day.
Ma, you're not going.
Why not?
I don't think you should be doing anything as strenuous as going to a sperm bank until you've had that checkup.
Too bad.
All right, I'll go to the doctor, but this better be a great sperm bank.
So, I guess we're going?
Oh, I guess.
What does one wear to a sperm bank?
Something attractive in rubber.
I have that.
Did you see the way those people on the elevator looked at us when you pushed "5"?
I'm so embarrassed.
Mama, they didn't look at us at all.
They didn't want to make eye contact with anybody going to the fifth floor - the sperm floor.
I think you're overreacting.
Perverts looked at us like we were perverts.
I know that look.
I thought it'd be more bank-like.
What did you expect, Rose?
I hardly think they have a Christmas club.
Hi.
I'm Rebecca Devereaux.
We have an appointment with Dr. Manning.
Right.
He'll be with you in just a few minutes.
Why don't you have a seat and I'll call you when he's ready.
I'm not here for me.
It's for a friend.
How did things go at the doctor's, Sophia?
He said I have the body of a 40-year-old.
A dead 40-year-old.
The doctor's gonna be a little while.
I guess we oughta sit down.
I suppose it's safe.
Mama, you're acting silly.
Sperm can't live outside the human body.
Does your mother know you're doing this for a living?
You know, I'm not so sure sperm can't live outside the body.
Back during World War II, my best friend Claire Osterhaus's husband was in the army and stationed in France.
Well, five months after he left St. Olaf, she got pregnant.
A lot of people thought she was fooling around, but she told me that sperm must have swum from Normandy.
Across the Atlantic, up the St. Lawrence Seaway, into the Great Lakes and then over to Minnesota.
And what did you think, Rose?
Well, I know those little guys are supposed to be good swimmers but I think it had to come over by mail.
I bet this is more fun than giving blood.
I've waited long enough.
That doctor has wasted enough of my time.
Come on.
Miss Devereaux, the doctor will see you now.
Through that door, end of the hall.
Come on, Mama.
Eyes straight, ladies.
Ma, no opening doors.
And that's pretty much the procedure.
Rebecca will be taken care of by her own doctor after selecting a donor from thousands of acceptable possibilities.
Any questions?
Plenty.
Can just anybody walk in off the street and make my daughter pregnant?
We screen the applicants very carefully.
We know everything about them.
We know their body type, their IQ, their eye color Any more questions?
Yes, just one.
What in hell are we doing here?
I feel like I'm in the middle of some awful dream, yet I know it can't be a dream 'cause there are no boy dancers.
Mother!
I just cannot believe you are actually gonna give money to someone like this sperm pusher.
You are a Devereaux.
A Devereaux has never had to pay for it.
I certainly haven't.
She's always depended on the kindness of strangers.
Fine.
Fine.
Make jokes.
I'd just like to know how you-all would feel if you thought you were gonna have a test tube for a son-in-law.
Sorry, Doctor.
I thought my mother was open enough to understand.
Thank you for your time.
Ladies.
Just outta curiosity, you don't have any Tony Bennett socked away, do you?
Blanche, your daughter is about to leave for the airport.
What the hell are you doing out here?
Well, there's still some sun.
I thought I might get a little color.
Blanche, this has to be absolutely the dumbest thing you could possibly do.
Dorothy's right.
The sun's rays can be dangerous now there's a hole in the ozone layer.
If you-all are out here to try to get me to patch things up with Rebecca, you can forget it.
Blanche, there comes a time when you have to let your daughter make her own decisions.
I remember, Dorothy, when you were deciding what you wanted to be.
Ah, yeah.
I wanted to go to college and be a schoolteacher.
Pop wanted me to be a cosmetician in a funeral parlor.
He always liked looking at dead people.
Dead people and the Dodgers.
That was it for him in the good-time department.
Sometimes, just to make him happy, I used to lie in bed with a baseball hat on.
Blanche, the point is, she let me make my own choices.
Now, this argument that you're having with Rebecca is not about artificial insemination.
Like hell it isn't.
Well, part of it is, but the bigger part, Blanche, is about control.
You refuse to see your daughter as an adult with the right to make her own decisions.
Honey, you're gonna have to learn to let go.
Yes, and the more you try to make her see things the way you see things, the more she'll resist, and then you run the risk of never seeing her again.
And never seeing your grandchild.
Never.
Think about it, Blanche.
Oh, damn, I don't want that to happen.
Then I suggest you apologize.
I know Rebecca is a grown woman, but to me she's still just a little girl.
How do you say "I'm sorry" to your own child?
Especially after all those years of sending them to their room until they were ready to apologize to you.
Now all of a sudden everything's just all topsy-turvy.
I don't know if I can do it.
Maybe it'd help if I sent you to your room.
Oh.
Rebecca.
Uh, honey Oh I'm  I'm I Oh, come on, Blanche.
Say it.
"I'm sorry".
There.
What she just said.
Oh, there.
I knew you could do it.
Oh, I've just been so dumb about this whole thing.
I should've respected what you wanted to do.
You really mean that?
Yes, I do.
Let me drive you to the airport and we'll think up baby names on the way.
Great.
I'll go get rid of the cab.
Oh Blanche, Blanche, you did the right thing.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You girls were right.
And, hey, listen.
If my daughter wants to get herself artificially inseminated, I guess that's not so bad.
Eww.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see The biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Dorothy, your father's on the phone.
Ma, Pop's been dead for 15 years.
Oh, you're right.
I'm getting old.
I meant, what's for dinner?
Mail call.
Rose.
Dorothy.
Thank you.
Here you go, Sophia.
Oh, I finally got my membership card from the Shoppers Warehouse store.
Gloria at the museum shops there, but don't you have to buy everything in large quantities?
So what?
They give you great bargains.
Wow, look at this.
If you buy ten boxes of adult diapers, they're only eight dollars a box.
Ma, you don't wear diapers.
A lot of my friends do.
I'll load up now and keep them for stocking stuffers.
This is terrible.
Trick move from your checkers-by-mail partner?
No, it's from the company Charlie worked for.
They've gone bankrupt and so has their pension fund.
I'm not gonna be getting pension checks anymore.
I can't afford to live without that pension.
Well, honey, now, let's not panic.
I'm sure they can't just cut you off.
She's right.
There has to be a good explanation.
Honey, you'll call them tomorrow, everything will be fine.
Well, what if it's not?
What if I can't pay my own way?
What if I can't afford food?
What if I have to sleep outside in some park?
You know, there's an old Italian saying for times like this: "Scapa, tu si mal fortuna".
What does that mean?
Get away from me, you're bad luck.
Rose, you're home early.
Yeah.
I called Charlie's company today and it turns out they have a legal right to cut off the pension.
Well, I don't make enough at the counseling center to live without that pension, so I figured I'd better get a new job.
I'm helping her look.
We're going through the classifieds and cutting out ads that might be of some interest to her.
"Single white male seeks traveling companion".
"Tour of European cathedrals.
No prudes".
That's my pile.
What a day.
Look at this.
Toothbrushes, 39 cents each.
I bought four gross.
Anybody in the mood to remove some plaque?
Oh, Ma, you have almost 600 toothbrushes here.
People don't use that many in a lifetime, and at your age Please, I'm way ahead of you.
I bought half pink, half blue, so after I'm gone, you and your brother Phil won't fight to see who gets them.
So that's what it feels like to be an heiress.
You're not cutting up the obituaries, are you?
I wanna make sure my canasta game is still on for tomorrow.
I'm looking for a job.
They cut off Charlie's pension.
He's dead.
How much does he need?
You know what gets me mad about this whole thing?
All those years Charlie put into that job just for the pension.
He used to say, "Rose, I hate selling horseshoes, but if I do it long enough, you'll be set for life".
Your husband sold horseshoes?
I thought he sold insurance.
Oh, he sold insurance for a while, but Charlie wasn't very good at it.
As soon as people said no, he'd give up.
Insurance salesmen have to keep going till they get a yes.
They have to keep talking and talking and talking, even if people aren't listening.
He should have taken you with him.
Anyway, after he was fired, he worked for an iron company.
He sold other things, but horseshoes were his specialty.
He had a sense of humor about it.
We couldn't pass a horse without Charlie saying: "Can I show you something in an Oxford"?
Ah, then he'd laugh and I'd laugh.
Sometimes, even the horse would laugh.
With them or at them?
Ma!
You know what you should do?
Call what's-his-name.
Ma, could you narrow that down a bit?
The what's-his-name on TV, on the news, the one who glues his head to the ceiling.
Oh, I think she means that consumer reporter on Channel 8.
Enrique Mas.
That's the guy.
Hey, that's not such a bad idea.
He helps a lot of people.
I believe he must be the best consumer reporter ever.
I didn't realize you were such a fan.
Oh, my.
Yes, Enrique Mas is a great champion of the people.
Besides, he has all that gorgeous black hair.
And those swarthy Latin good looks and the sexy way he rolls his r's.
Enrique.
Boy, I'd love to get him on a couch made out of Corinthian leather.
The woman has such lofty ambitions.
Thanks for the suggestion, Sophia, but there's really nothing Enrique Mas can do.
They have the legal right to cut off the pension.
No, I'll just have to get out there tomorrow and start looking for a job.
Be sure you dress youthfully.
How come?
You're old.
Let's face it, honey.
Companies are not falling all over themselves to hire women your age.
I wonder why it is people don't like to hire older women?
Probably makes them feel uncomfortable.
You know, they feel like they're bossing their mothers around.
Ma, stop that!
It's understandable.
Pussycat, can you lend me $20?
Ma, this is the second time this week that you've come to me for money.
Now, what happened to your allowance?
Something's come up.
A medical emergency.
Can I have the money?
What medical Ma, what's wrong?
I think I'm pregnant.
What happened?
The rabbit died laughing?
What do you need the money for?
They're having a special at Shoppers Warehouse.
It's something I really need.
What?
Tube socks.
Ma, you know, this is how Imelda Marcos got started with that shoe thing.
Now, Ma, what is going on?
I don't know.
It makes me feel good.
In a strange way, shopping there makes you feel immortal.
I don't follow.
Let's say you buy 20 cases of sardines.
This better be just an example.
Of course.
You get 20 cases of sardines, you figure: "God doesn't want me to waste good sardines".
"He's gonna wait till I finish the 20 cases".
That could take five, six years.
Yeah, well, why couldn't you just eat one case slowly?
Silly, isn't it?
What in the hell are all those sardines doing in the kitchen?
Oh, Ma!
Wait till you're my age.
We'll see what kind of straws you clutch at.
Hi, honey.
How did it go?
Not so good.
I looked all day and came up with nothing.
I'm beat.
Oh, honey.
Come on, sit down.
Relax.
Can I get you a sardine sandwich?
Maybe later.
I knew it would be rough looking for a job, but not this rough.
You didn't find anything?
Oh, I found one job I wanted.
I would have been perfect for it, but they told me I was too old.
What kind of job?
Assistant manager in a pet store.
I don't know why they didn't hire me.
I worked in a pet store in St. Olaf for ten years.
I mean, I was the one who thought up big, squeaky toys for cows.
You didn't tell them that, did you, Rose?
I didn't have a chance.
Before I could tell them my qualifications, they told me I was too old.
Well, they can't do that.
That is age discrimination.
Rose, you can fight this.
What do you mean?
What should I do?
I don't wanna make a fuss.
Well, then, call Enrique Mas and let him make your fuss for you.
Right there on television.
You gotta stand up for your rights, Rose.
All right, maybe I'll call.
Rose.
Well, I just feel overwhelmed.
How could this have happened?
Charlie and I were so careful with our money.
We saved.
We never splurged.
OK, one year, we went to Chicago to tour the stockyards.
But it was our 20th anniversary.
We had a romantic trip coming.
You must have been the envy of every woman in St. Olaf.
Oh, it was more than the stockyards.
We even got to see where Crisco is made.
The point is, we thought I'd have enough money for the rest of my life, as long as I had his pension.
Now the reality is I probably have enough for only a couple of months.
What's with the sardines?
Ma, how are we going to get rid of all of this?
Don't worry.
Tomorrow, we're getting five cases of pickled onions.
Boy, life sure has a way of throwing you curve balls.
When I was younger, I never would have imagined that I'd be worrying about money at this stage of my life.
I used to think Stan would take care of me.
I mean, we didn't have much saved, but he was a darn good novelty salesman.
Sounds naive now to think that I placed my hopes for the future on a bald pinhead with the morals of a maggot who made his living selling plastic dog-doo.
Well, at least I'm not bitter.
I always assumed I'd be kept by a younger man.
It's not too late.
They get younger every day.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
I don't know how much longer I'll be able to pay the rent.
I can't live here anymore.
Now, I won't hear any more of this.
You will call Enrique Mas and you will get that job at the pet store that you deserve.
And you will stay here with us as long as we can afford it.
She's right.
Rose, you have to fight this.
You know, every morning, when I leave the house, I see this bag lady going through the garbage over on 135th Street.
She has everything she owns piled in one of those old shopping carts.
Well, the other day, for the first time, I noticed she's about our age.
You know, you always feel sorry for someone like that, but I wondered, what did she do to get herself into a fix like that?
I thought, well, she must be lazy.
Or she must be pretty stupid to let something like this happen to her.
But the truth is she's me.
God, what am I gonna do?
Excuse me.
Can I help you?
Rose Nylund, to see Terry Franco.
Oh, hi, Mrs. Nylund.
I'm Terry.
Hi.
It was so nice of Mr. Mas to see me on such short notice.
I'm sorry.
Maybe you misunderstood me on the phone.
I'll be helping you.
Enrique will get involved and put you on TV only if your age discrimination case gets really ugly and the company tries to discredit you, drag your name through the mud and make you look stupid.
I guess we can only hope.
OK, I'll need to get some information from you.
Terry, are there any applicants for the new production assistant's job coming in this afternoon?
They'll be here at two.
Hi.
How do you do, madam?
I am  Enrique Mas.
Mrs. Nylund is here on an age-discrimination complaint.
I can assure you, I will try very hard to help you.
Could I ask you something?
I heard you mention you're gonna be hiring a new production assistant.
Could I apply for that job?
I'm a big fan of yours and I respect your work.
I know I'd be terrific.
Oh, I'm sorry.
But I'm afraid you're just not the right type.
The job requires someone with great energy and drive and quite frankly, someone of your advanced age Wait a minute.
I'm here on an age-discrimination case and you're telling me I'm too old?
Oh, it is not me.
It is  Enrique Mas.
I'm confused.
Please, let me explain.
You see, there are two mes.
There is Enrique Mas, the dedicated consumer advocate, fighting for justice and equality.
And then there is  Enrique Mas, the television personality who wants to get out of this local station and onto the networks so he can become a really big fish in a big pond.
It is  Enrique who has  reservations.
I can't believe it.
You're a fake.
I am not a fake.
Mrs. Nylund, ever since I was a little boy, I wanted to be on TV.
Do you know what that's like for a Hispanic kid?
Who were my role models?
Zorro and Ricky Ricardo.
A gay caballero and a man who couldn't recognize his own wife in a fake mustache.
I swore that if I ever got on TV, I would maintain the highest standards.
Enrique Mas demands the best.
Well, hold it right there!
You can't write me off just because I'm not 30-something.
I have experience.
And wisdom.
And insight.
I'd be perfect for this job.
You see, I am the battered consumer.
I drive a Gremlin, for God's sake.
I tell you what I'll do.
Will you accept a test?
You bet.
One of the most important parts of this job is product testing.
I will give you a test to do at home.
You will bring in the results, and I will see how you do.
But I must warn you, both Enrique Mas and  Enrique Mas demand that the results be accurate in every detail.
Oh, thank you very much, Mr. Mas.
You can call me  Enrique.
No, I don't think I can.
I don't know how to thank you all for helping me with this test.
Pay us.
Ma!
It's our pleasure, Rose.
OK, what we have to do is try these different hair-removal products, evaluate their advantages and disadvantages and see which one gets our legs the smoothest.
Sophia, why don't you try the regular razor?
Dorothy, would you like to try this thing?
What is it?
Well, that wire vibrates and it's supposed to whisk hair away from below the skin line.
I don't know whether I wanna use this.
It says it's gonna hurt.
Well, you can try it on your right leg and then use the hot wax on your left one.
Why don't we just set each other on fire?
Dorothy.
All right, all right.
Let's see if they sent a bullet to bite on.
Your choice, Blanche.
Razor or cream remover?
Cheesecake.
This reminds me of the first time I ever shaved my legs.
It was at a slumber party when I was 11 years old.
What's a slumber party without snacks?
Instead of cheesecake, let's have oatmeal cookies.
Why?
Because we have so many of them.
Ma, you didn't.
I did.
That's it.
That's it!
No more!
Now, I know that you feel that shopping at Shoppers Warehouse is some kind of a religious experience for you, but I absolutely forbid you to ever go there again.
All right.
All right.
Does this mean no cookies?
Well, as long as we own them Blanche, did you really start shaving at 11?
That seems so young.
Oh, I did it on a dare.
You know, back where I come from, everybody thought that once you started shaving your legs, why, you'd become loose.
So I shaved 'em.
What happened?
Oh, it was an old wives' tale.
I didn't become loose for another year and a half.
I remember when I started shaving.
I was 13, and I wanted to shave because I was going to a movie with Alan Steckler.
You remember him, Ma?
Small head, enormous lips.
Anyway, Ma told me that, once I started shaving, I'd never be able to stop.
I mean, she said I'd regret it for the rest of my life because my legs would have bristles.
I was right.
By the time you were 16, I could grate cheese on your knees.
When did you start, Sophia?
Oh, late.
Not till I came to this country.
In my village, hairy legs were a sign of beauty.
How do you account for that?
Dumb men, hairy women.
Actually, that's not such a big surprise.
You know, a lot of those European girls don't shave under their arms.
Is that true?
They just let it all hang out.
Really?
Bushy as can be.
Well, what do they look like in a strapless dress?
Like Milton Berle, Rose.
There's nothing wrong with it.
It's perfectly natural.
Well, it's a little too natural if you ask me.
I prefer to be smooth under my arms and from my ankle to the top of my thigh.
Get outta here.
What?
You shave above the knee?
Well, of course.
Get outta here.
Surely, Rose, you have heard of women shaving above the knee?
Get outta here.
Rose, you say that one more time and we will.
I never heard of anything like that before.
When men see that you shave your legs above the knee, what does that say to them?
Hopefully, it says, "Touch my leg".
That's in case they miss the tattoo that says the same thing.
Boy, my mother would kill me if I ever did that.
She never wanted me to shave at all.
By the time I got to high school, the kids had made up this really mean nickname for me just because I had hairy legs.
What did they call you?
Rose with the hairy legs.
Kids can be so cruel.
It's almost dinnertime.
Now, what could be taking Rose so long at that job interview?
I mean, if she's taking this long, that's a good sign, isn't it?
I mean, how long does it take to say no?
What are you asking her for?
She never said no in her life.
You know, just to be on the safe side, when she gets home, we shouldn't ask her what happened.
We should just keep the conversation in a positive direction.
That is a very good point.
I mean, she might be totally devastated.
So no matter how bad the news, let's just smile and show her that we believe in her.
Guess what.
Aw.
No, I got the job.
Rose, that's wonderful!
I don't know how to thank you.
Enrique Mas said my report was accurate and concise and very professional.
Oh, it's so exciting.
Tomorrow, I start comparing artificial sweeteners.
And next week, I get to test crash helmets.
You will leave us out of that one, won't you, Rose?
Oh, that's wonderful, honey.
That's just wonderful.
You know what the best part is?
I get to stay here.
That's what worried me most.
I mean, I don't think I ever really doubted that somehow I'd wind up on my feet, but what worried and scared me was that I'd have to leave my friends and my family.
Oh, honey.
It scared me too, but I told you you were welcome-- OK, OK, everybody.
Get washed up.
Rose, I knew you'd get that job, so I made a special dinner to celebrate.
Sophia, that's so nice.
Don't mention it.
When I was shaving my legs last night, it really made me feel good.
That you were helping Rose?
That I can still touch my ankles.
What did you make that's so special?
Sardine casserole with kind of an oatmeal cookie crust.
I hope you like it.
There's a lot.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Hi, Sophia.
Boy, I tell you, there is nothing more invigorating than spending a little time on a boat.
Oh, yeah?
Not when I sailed to America.
Picture it.
There we were - a tired, poor, huddled mass eating marinara sauce out of a can.
It was hell.
And the entertainment?
Some guy from Palermo forgot his accordion, so he sat around singing "0 Solo Mio" while squeezing a monkey.
Sophia.
Sophia what?
It was the worst time of my life.
If it weren't for pin the tail on the French, we would've gone stir-crazy.
Hi, Sophia.
Rose, I was just telling Sophia what a wonderful day we had.
Wonderful, my foot.
Blanche, you saw that dolphin.
All tangled up in that tuna boat's net.
Thousands of them die that way each year.
We have to do something.
You are absolutely right.
From this moment on, no more tuna fish.
Blanche, you hate tuna fish.
All right.
Then no more tuna fishermen.
Hi, girls.
Do these pearls look OK with this?
Honey, pearls look fine with everything, from the fanciest dress to that.
You have another date with Ken.
Oh, Sophia, do you believe it?
And I thought my head was spinning from the splash of vino in my lemonade.
Sophia, you don't put wine in your lemonade.
No.
You're right.
I don't.
It was a joke.
Ha-ha.
Your Ken is quite a catch, Dorothy.
For once I'm a bit jealous.
What's not to be jealous about?
The man's gorgeous.
He's got money and class.
I couldn't be happier for you, Dorothy.
I just want to give you a loving mother's advice: Don't blow it!
Ma, I have no intention of blowing this.
No, Ken is perfect.
I mean, aside from being one of Miami's most successful lawyers Thank you, Ma.
The man is caring.
He's sensitive.
Do you know that on weekends, he actually puts on a clown's costume and entertains sick kids at the hospital?
I mean, what more could I want from a man?
Get it out of the gutter, Blanche.
Dorothy.
Hi, sweetheart.
How was your day?
My ulcer didn't flare up and I'm having dinner with you.
So I guess it's perfect.
Hi, Ken.
Hey, Kenny.
What's a nice boy like you doing with ulcers anyway?
You got a job and a girl who'll do anything for you.
Anything.
You will, won't you, Dorothy?
I'll take that as a "Have a good time".
Don't worry, Mrs. Petrillo.
I'll have your little girl home at a reasonable hour.
Don't bother.
You kids have fun.
I won't wait up.
Have her back by Tuesday.
No questions asked.
She's gonna blow it.
OK, Paul, we'll see you at the rally on pier five.
Oh, the dolphin will really appreciate it.
Oh, isn't this exciting?
Taking part in a protest.
Standing up as free Americans and exercising our right to say: "We're mad as hell and we're not gonna take it anymore"!
I'm out of spit.
Can I go now?
and you're ready to quit?
Blanche, we joined the Friends of Sea Mammals for a reason.
You are so unmotivated.
Well, when I joined this Mammals with Blowholes thing, I didn't expect to be carrying picket signs on some grungy dock.
I was hoping more for a fundraiser cocktail party with Chinese lanterns and Portuguese, no, Hispanic waiters in tight black pants.
And we hire a band to play fish songs in pirate suits with muscles bulging.
Your mouth is watering now, Blanche.
Keep licking.
Hi, girls.
You two are back early.
Of course we're back early.
Ken called before.
He says he needs to talk to Dorothy about something very important.
Dorothy!
My God, Dorothy, he's gonna pop the question.
Oh, I don't know that.
Of course you do.
What else could it be?
Honey, congratulations.
You're more excited than I am.
Well, why not, Dorothy?
Just think of it.
Life with a successful attorney.
The summer homes, the glamorous social circles, those impulsive little trips to Europe with rascally Romans pinching your bottom.
You're a lucky girl, Dorothy.
I hate you.
This is just crazy talk.
I mean, we've only been seeing each other for three months.
I've never even thought of what it would be like if I were Mrs. Kenneth Whittingham.
Has a nice ring to it.
Go get 'em, pussycat.
Just remember, you and I come as a package.
Ma!
Hi.
Sweetheart, I am so excited.
Oh?
It's just that I've come to a major decision.
Oh?
And it's a decision that affects both of us.
Ohh?
Sit down.
Close your eyes and I'll give you a hint.
Okey-dokey.
Well?
Can you guess what my decision is?
You're becoming Irish?
No.
I'm becoming a clown.
A full-time circus clown.
Ken, isn't this a bit sudden?
Odd and a bit sudden?
No.
I've been doing it for years at children's hospitals.
It's been the one bright spot in my life.
That and you.
Dorothy, I've been lawyering Can change a man.
Yeah, but you're so successful.
I'm also 60 and I'm miserable.
Ah, I went to law school so I could fight for the little guy.
Now I'm fighting for multinational corporations.
I'm so frazzled, I find myself sneaking into the washroom to make balloon giraffes.
Dorothy, I really need for you to understand this.
I've been thinking a lot lately.
I think we're in this for the long haul.
Dorothy, I think this is going to be a very serious relationship.
I feel like a virgin.
Where do the noses go?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
What do you say?
You with me?
Of course.
Oh, great.
How about a celebration?
I'm dining with friends from the circus.
Join me?
Might as well get my feet wet.
Oh, Ken.
There won't be, like, a dozen tiny dogs, hopping on hind legs, wearing funny hats?
Oh, I wish.
Oh, come on, tell me.
How big a disaster was last night?
It wasn't a disaster, Blanche.
It was just uncomfortable.
I tried to find common ground, something I could talk to Ken's circus friends about.
But it turns out the Human Cannonball doesn't do that much reading.
Does Ken know how you feel?
He asked me how I felt, if I had a good time, and I had to tell him the truth.
I just didn't fit in with the other clowns' wives.
Dorothy, I've been thinking.
It might help you get your mind off this Ken thing for a while.
Why don't you join us at the rally?
Oh, no-- Oh, yeah, Dorothy.
Oh, do.
Oh, get out of yourself.
It's for a noble cause.
Or are you so self-centered that you'd rather wallow in self-pity?
You're right.
I'll do it.
Oh, good.
Rose, Dorothy's taking my place.
There you are, pussycat.
What's this news about Ken?
He gave you a ring, didn't he?
Yeah.
Three of them.
Look, Ma, I don't know how to say this, so I'll just give it to you straight out.
Ken is becoming a clown.
Scusi?
Ma, he's tired of being a lawyer, so he's joining the circus.
What did you do to him?
I didn't do anything.
Yeah, right.
One day the man's a lawyer, the next he's a clown.
Perfectly natural.
Ma, please!
This is hard enough as it is.
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
I just tend to get a little upset when people ruin my life!
Sophia, I don't know what all the hullabaloo is about.
Dating a circus clown would be a dream come true for me.
Reach for the stars, Rose.
No, it would.
Think about it.
Seeing him push those little pigs around in a baby carriage.
Getting hit with a bucket of confetti any time you want.
And sitting up there in the stands, watching him sweep that spotlight into a little circle and thinking, "That's my man"!
It's getting hot in here.
Why did this happen?
Just when I meet someone that I feel I have a future with, Ken does this.
I know I should be more supportive, but the fact is, I'm embarrassed.
Don't be ridiculous, Dorothy.
You love the man for who he is.
It's not like he's driving you around in a tiny car with a giant key on the back.
Is he?
Hi, sweetheart.
You are driving the Lincoln tonight?
Sure.
Oh, two things.
We're doubling with Phil and Nancy tonight.
Two things you have to remember: Call them "little people".
And they hate to be patted on the head.
I found out the hard way.
Kenny.
Come here.
What's with this clown business?
Couldn't you be a lawyer and just hang out with clowns?
I know it sounds a little odd, Mrs. Petrillo, but right now I'm just burned out on law.
Frankly, I think I can contribute more to the world in big red shoes and a spinning bow tie and carrying a little umbrella that rains on me.
I see.
Dorothy?
Here.
What did you do to him?
We may not agree with the fishermen, but we want this demonstration to be peaceful.
In the tradition of you know, the short, bald Indian fellow with the glasses and the diaper.
You know, the one who didn't eat and won an Oscar.
Your sign's drooping again.
Now, what's the matter?
It's Ken.
I don't know which end is up.
He called me this morning.
He wants me to travel with the circus.
I'm afraid we're gonna have to call it quits.
Oh, honey, I'd think twice before I cut that guy off.
At your age, how many chances at the brass ring do you have left?
All creatures must learn to coexist.
Back where I come from, they do.
That's why the brown bear and the field mouse can share their lives and live in harmony.
'Course, they can't mate, or the mice would explode.
Well, you know what I mean.
I think Rose needs to work on her metaphors.
I know you're down in the dumps, but I'm so glad you came.
I really want us to make a difference today.
Blanche, I am impressed.
You have really changed your tune.
It's funny how that happened.
There I was, staying up last night, coming up with excuses to get out of this.
And then it occurred to me.
I said, "Water Lily" That's what I call myself sometimes.
Oh.
"Water Lily, you've never done anything like this in your life.
Now, this is important.
"For the love of mother earth and the love of mother nature, commit yourself to this, Blanche Devereaux"!
Isn't that exciting?
Caught a rerun of Flipper on cable, did you?
A particularly touching one.
Where Flipper comes to the rescue.
It was only after that I picked up Rose's pamphlets and read about these magnificent creatures.
Oh, that's beautiful.
Water Lily?
Uh-huh.
All right, you dolphin people, get away from the gate.
Watch it.
What are you Why can't you people see the light?
Why can't you people see that there's another point of view?
Get away from here.
Take your hands off me!
Let her go!
Sweetheart, I came as soon as I could.
Things got out of hand down at the dock.
I'm fine.
Don't worry.
I called Ken.
He's parking the car.
Oh!
Did you hear that?
Did you hear that?
Ken is going to save us.
Everybody, did you hear that?
We'll be out of here in no time.
My mother called my boyfriend, a top Miami lawyer.
Nothing to worry about.
We are in good hands.
Oh!
Dorothy, sweetheart, there you are.
My God!
Ma, you didn't tell me he was in a clown suit!
Oh, yeah.
Ken, how could you?
Sophia called me at rehearsal.
I'll change.
I just wanted to make sure you were all right.
Is counsel for the demonstrators present?
Here, Your Honor.
Oh, God.
Will the clown approach the bench?
Dorothy, I can do this.
Can you do it without the nose?
Yes.
What the hell are you trying to do?
I know this looks odd.
But I am a registered member of the bar.
I have a card here to prove it.
We're going to jail.
I believe you, counselor, I believe you.
Just proceed.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Make it quick.
Your Honor, this may be my very last appearance before the bar.
Would you indulge me just a little?
Thank you.
You know, I have been practicing law for many, many years, and it's always amazed me how little my job actually had to do with justice.
This stuff sounds a little better when you've got lapels and a vest.
Anyway, my clients are charged with trespass.
But the only real crime they committed was their overzealous championing of the defenseless dolphin.
The dolphin, Your Honor, that for centuries has rescued men lost at sea, guided ships back to port.
No, my clients were not trespassing.
My clients were returning the favor.
They simply wanted to protect some of nature's best creations from extinction.
Your Honor you have the opportunity today to make a very disillusioned lawyer happy.
Please answer to a law higher than this state's, and dispense some real justice here.
Please, let's have a little quiet here.
That was a great speech.
Thank you, Your Honor.
But help me out here.
How about something from a law book?
OK.
The fracas occurred on a seaside dock abutting navigable waters.
I don't believe that this court has any jurisdiction.
That sounds legal to me.
Counselor, your last day has been a good one.
Case dismissed.
I want you two jailbirds to feel at home.
Dinner's at six.
Pass it on.
Rose, honey, what is the matter?
We didn't accomplish anything today, Blanche.
Those tuna fishermen will be out there again tomorrow doing the same thing.
I swear, I feel like a failure.
You can't change the world in one day.
But just think about what we did do.
I bet we saved a few dolphin by keeping that boat off the water, and the next time you're walking along the beach and you see a school swim by, why, you can think, "Maybe I saved those gorgeous creatures from those horrible nets".
You still think we were a failure?
You're right.
I just wish we could save 'em all.
You wanna do more?
Fine.
Let's go back down to the dock.
Really?
Sure.
I know a waterfront bar where a lot of foreign fishermen hang out.
Do you think they'd listen to me?
Well, sure, they will, honey.
They don't speak English and they're horny.
Where are you going?
To demonstrate.
To celebrate.
So, anything special you want to do tonight?
Ken There is something.
Dorothy, you know you have the most beautiful eyes?
And a quarter in your ear.
We really have to talk.
What's the matter?
I don't know whether this is harder to say or harder to hear.
Ken, you're a lovable man, with a lot of lovable qualities, but I don't love you.
It's this clown thing, isn't it?
I thought that's what was bothering me.
But, Ken, if I loved you, I'd follow you anywhere.
I'm sorry.
I see.
I think we were both trying too hard to make this work.
You on your terms, me on mine.
But I know that I am not prepared to give up my life.
And, Ken, could you give up the circus for me?
Could you give up the laughter?
The smiles on those children's faces?
Do you know something, Dorothy?
I don't think I could.
Could I give up the fat lady for you?
No.
Could I give up the elephants for you?
No.
The chimps?
The sword-swallower-- Ken.
I think I have a grip on this.
I guess at our age, we do a lot of wishful thinking.
We did come close, though.
If the circus is ever in town, I'll leave the tent flap open for you.
I'm gonna miss you.

Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Oh Blanche, what are you doing lining shelves on a Friday night?
I'm workin' off all my excess sexual energy.
Why don't we just hook you up to the toaster and make Pop-Tarts?
Don't make fun, Dorothy.
This is the fifth Friday night in a row I haven't had a date.
Honey, you're just in a little slump.
Is that what this is?
I never been in one before.
Well, it feels like hell.
Dorothy, how do you go through this for years at a stretch?
I have compassionate friends around me.
Well, I guess eventually this was bound to happen.
I can just feel my femininity slippi" through my fingers.
And in the past there's always been a man there to catch it.
Oh Blanche, you're being ridiculous.
You are as attractive and desirable as you always were.
But a lot of men can be frightened by that.
They don't know if they can handle that much woman.
So every once in a while this'll happen.
No, Blanche, it takes a strong, confident, sophisticated man to appreciate you.
But, honey, they're out there wanting you as much as you want them.
I knew it had to be something like that.
Thank you, Dorothy.
There really is one born every minute.
Ha ha.
Thanks for seeing us home, Miles.
It's my pleasure, Rose.
Well, hello, there.
Oh, I didn't know you had company.
Dorothy, Blanche, I'd like you to meet Miles Webber.
How do you do, Miles?
Nice to meet you.
Thank you.
A real delight.
Miles is my dancing partner at the ballroom.
Oh, yes, and tonight we were the king and queen of the rumba.
OlÃ©.
Ma, did you have a good time?
Great.
I even made a few bucks.
How did you do that, Sophia?
The place was packed with old geezers ripe for the picking.
I charged them Ma, you didn't!
Please.
I worked hard for that money.
Half the time they'd fall asleep in the middle of a song.
How would you like to hold Mr. Morelli up for two choruses of "Jeepers Creepers"?
Ma, you did all that for 10 cents?
I know.
It's worth a buck.
But all these guys lived through the Depression.
For a buck they expect a good time, a shoe shine and a full tank of gas.
Listen, Rose, I'm having a little get-together over at my place tomorrow night.
Someone I work with is retiring, and I was hoping you'd come.
Oh, I'd love it.
Around 8:00, then?
Mm.
Oh, good.
Well, good night, ladies.
Nice meeting you.
Come back and see us some time.
Good night, Rose.
Good night.
As they say in St. Olaf, helderbargenberg gefloefen wurterberg.
You wanna help us out here, Rose?
Well, there's really no English word for gefloefen.
Loosely translated, it means, "I hope you have a license to carry that gefloefen".
And, uh, this is a quality that you look for in a man?
Yes.
Oh, maybe I'm crazy to be so attracted by someone I hardly know, but I can't help it.
I've been dying for him to ask me out, but we never really talk, we just dance.
Well, what do you know about him?
Nothing.
Except he's a wonderful dancer.
Oh, well, what's that?
All that proves is he has rhythm.
I see what you mean.
You know, you can learn a lot about a man just by the way he holds you in his arms.
Whether he's kind, sensitive, caring He dipped you, didn't he?
All evening.
Oh, Lord.
So long since I've been dipped.
I can't even remember which end of a gefloefen is up.
Rose.
Well, come on in.
You're missing all the fun.
I'll bet you probably thought that a party full of college professors would be stuffy, but not this one.
You're a college professor?
Well, what did you think I meant when I said I taught Hemingway?
I thought you were old.
Come on.
I want you to meet some people, Rose.
Gale, Lillian, this is my friend Rose.
How do you do?
Hello.
Miles, we were just hypothesizing.
If you were to invite any two people, living or dead, to dinner, who would they be?
Well, Lillian picked Winston Churchill and Browning without his wife.
Rose, whom would you pick?
Just two?
Well, that's tough.
I Well, I'd feel guilty if I didn't invite my two best friends, Dorothy and Blanche, but would it be OK if Jesus stopped by for dessert?
Didn't I tell you she was something special?
Rose, why don't I get you something to drink?
What would you like?
Ginger ale if you have it.
All right.
Oh, but first I want to introduce you to two of my closest friends.
Harv, Elise, this is my friend Rose.
Take good care of her.
Hello.
We were just having a little disagreement.
Now, Harv, Moby Dick is about self-fulfilling prophesy.
Oh, come on, Elise.
The whale represents coming to terms with the self-hatred that's in all of us.
What do you think?
Uh I-I was just having a conversation with two people over there speculating on if you could have any two people in the world, living or dead, to your house for dinner, what would you eat?
Blanche, I didn't know you went out.
Are you coming back from a date?
You know, Dorothy, sometimes you can be so cruel.
Honey, If you didn't have a date, how come you're so dressed up?
Well, I sat down and tried to think of a surefire place to meet men.
It was so obvious I couldn't believe I hadn't thought of it before.
The hardware store.
I mean, hardware stores are alive with sexual energy.
Tools, plugs, sockets, nude furniture, dirty stuff like that.
Why are you home so early?
Well, I saw a very attractive man in power tools.
I piqued his interest with the usual hardware questions.
"Where does this go"?
"What does this do"?
And he followed me to plumbing, where I bought a see-through shower curtain.
And, uh, where is he now?
Tied to the roof rack of your car?
No, there was something about him that turned me off.
I think it was the way he cleaned his ears with his keys.
Hi.
You're home early.
Did you enjoy yourself?
Not really.
Miles' friends are all college professors.
I don't get it.
When we're on the dance floor, it feels like we're made for each other.
But tonight, with all his brilliant friends at the party, I felt like a fish out of water.
Oh, sure I didn't flop around on the floor with my eyes bulging out gasping for air.
I haven't done that at a party in years.
Honey, you know, anybody would feel out of her league in a room full of college professors.
You should have a home field advantage.
Why don't you invite him over here?
Dorothy's right.
We can create the illusion that you're interestin'.
That's a hell of an illusion.
Maybe we should just saw her in half.
Excuse me.
I'll get the coffee.
Dinner was delicious, Rose.
What was it?
It's a Scandinavian specialty - kuldomar.
I've never heard of that before, but it's marvelous.
Oh, you just throw together some ground pork and cabbage.
Cabbage, she serves me.
In ten minutes I could be sky-writing.
You girls were right about getting Miles on my turf.
Oh, Blanche, and I'm really grateful for you steering the table talk to things I know about.
Well, you ought to be.
It wasn't that easy working natural fertilizer into the dinner conversation.
What are you planning next?
I don't know.
Do you think it's too soon to put on the bloopers tape?
Just a tad.
So the existentialist says to the psychiatrist, "Just because you don't see a parrot on my head"  Eh?
You see?
Ooh, listen.
Rose, I was wondering.
If you're not busy Saturday afternoon, the university is playing Shostakovich.
Oh, I'd love to go.
And I'll bet we beat 'em.
Rose, honey, it's not a team.
It's a composer.
Oh.
I better get the dessert.
She sure left in a hurry.
Hey, who told her to feed me cabbage?
I thought I'd give you a hand with the dessert.
What's wrong, Rose?
"It's not a team, Rose.
It's a composer".
Couldn't you pretend it was a team and make him look stupid?
Honey, I'm sorry.
I'm not going back out there.
He'll never miss me.
Of course he'll miss you.
Rose, you're the one he came to see.
But he can talk to you.
Why should he care about what I'd have to say?
I'm just not smart enough to keep up.
Oh, now, Rose, that is not true.
It is and you know it.
I've never felt like this before.
I was one of the smartest people in St. Olaf.
I was a fool to think we could have a relationship.
Please apologize to him for me.
I'd do it, but it would just sound stupid.
Fine.
I will tell her.
Bye-bye.
Hi.
Hi, Rose.
Rose, Miles called again.
He wants you to meet him outside the concert hall.
I asked you to tell him I'm not going.
I'm not gonna do your dirty work for you, Rose.
Well, I don't wanna talk to him.
He makes me feel foolish.
I don't even feel comfortable telling him St. Olaf stories.
I wanna know exactly what he's said to make you feel that way.
Look, I'm not going out with him.
You go, Blanche.
What?
Well, you like him.
I know you do.
So you go.
Why, I couldn't.
Of course she couldn't.
You stay outta this, Dorothy.
Well, why not?
It's all over between us.
He'll know that tonight.
It's impossible.
I'd - I'd feel like a I'd feel like a A backstabbing slut?
No.
Then please go, for me.
I'll feel better knowing this thing is finally over with.
Well, since you put it that way But only as a personal favor to you, honey.
Well, I guess I'd better go get dressed.
Thank you, Blanche.
Can you believe that backstabbing slut?
Oh, Ma, you going to the ballroom again?
No.
I was thinking of wearing this when I die.
What do you think?
Come on, Rose, why aren't you ready?
I'm not going.
How come?
Miles might be there, and I don't know.
Oh, now, Rose, don't say you're going to feel stupid.
You are not stupid.
You just march to a different drummer.
Yeah, the little windup monkey banging on the snare drum.
Ma I was agreeing.
Blanche, how was the concert?
It is amazing how music that loud can be so boring.
And Miles?
Oh, even more boring than the music.
All he did all night was talk about you.
How sweet Rose is.
How attractive Rose is.
How much fun Rose is.
I might as well have worn a bra.
Did he really say that?
You're not just making that up?
I never make up stories where I come out lookin' bad.
He also said he's going to the ballroom tonight, and he hopes you'll be there.
Oh, I couldn't.
Oh, I mean, I want to, but I can't.
Why not?
What if Miles and I are dancing and I say something idiotic?
Just breathe it in his ear.
Nothing sounds idiotic if it's wet enough.
Will you come with me for moral support?
Oh, not tonight, Rose.
No, no.
I wanna get to bed early, curl up with a good book.
That's all you ever do.
No, it isn't.
Yes, it is, Dorothy.
That's all you've done lately, and it's pathetic.
What's even more pathetic is that I've been home to watch.
Dorothy, I really need you there.
I need your shoulder in case he takes his away.
Oh, all right, I'll go.
Ma, where are my dancing shoes?
In the Smithsonian, right next to Fred Astaire's.
How the hell would I know?
Blanche, you coming with us?
Oh, you're kidding.
Of course.
Oh, you'll love it.
Oh!
Nothing personal, honey, but those places are meant for desperate, hopeless people who can't find someone any other way.
Well, if you're sure.
I'd rather be tied to a tree covered in honey and have a family of grizzlies lick it off.
Why do I torture myself like this?
Girls, wait for me!
Ma, this-this place is fantastic.
I feel like I did when I was 20.
You mean unmarried and pregnant?
Blanche, look around.
Isn't this wonderful?
Aren't you suddenly the life of the party?
This place gives me the creeps.
But look, Blanche.
See how much fun everybody's having?
Yeah, right now, but wait till they hear Glenn Miller's dead.
He's not dead.
He's missing!
Stop complaining, Blanche.
Look at all the available men here.
You shouldn't have any problem.
Are you kiddin'?
This is gonna be just like fishin' in one of those trout farms.
May I have this dance, Sophia?
I got the time if you got the dime.
I'm all yours.
I don't see Miles here anywhere.
Maybe he didn't come tonight.
He almost didn't.
Hi, Dorothy.
Hello, Miles.
You left my party as soon as you arrived.
You invite me to dinner, you disappear into the house.
You send Blanche to the concert.
I was beginning to take it personally.
Shall we?
Go on, Rose.
Excuse me, Dorothy.
I am going to keep one arm around your waist to make sure you don't disappear again.
Dorothy, this is Alfred.
He's an ear, nose and throat specialist.
He says he's been lookin' for love in all the wrong places.
I was happy to see you here tonight, Rose.
I was starting to wonder how you felt about me.
Rose, is there something wrong?
You've hardly said a word.
Ah.
I'm glad to hear it.
Would you care to dance?
Oh, I I don't think so.
Oh.
I'm usually not this forward, but Glenn Miller has such an effect on me.
You don't like Glenn Miller, do you?
Are you kidding?
I was in the search party.
Let's dance.
Oh, listen to that music.
Who says you can't go home again?
Canute Trollsted.
You see, he took Ilse Frickerdeller up to Smooch Point to play hide the fingerborg.
That's a thimble.
Well, Ilse sat on his compass, and they got so lost they walked to Finland, and that's when Canute said, "You can't go home again".
Well, that's very, uh Stupid!
Rose.
Rose.
Is something wrong?
I don't know what you see in me, Miles.
I see you.
But why me?
I thought you'd like Blanche.
I like Blanche very much.
So does Blanche.
Ha ha ha.
That's better.
I feel so dumb around you.
Oh, never say that, Rose.
But you're a teacher.
You you think for a living.
Well, don't be so impressed.
I have summers off.
How you can stand listening to me and all my ridiculous stories Your stories are very refreshing, Rose.
It's like driving in the country and getting lost.
You may not know where you are, but you always have a good time finding your way out.
That was a compliment, wasn't it?
Come on.
I like you very much, Rose.
You know, you're you're very special.
I'm just lucky to be smart enough to see it.
You know, life's a ballroom, Rose, if you'll pardon the metaphor.
If you hear something you like, don't analyze it, just just dance to it.
You understand?
I think so.
Except what a metaphor is.
Who needs metaphors?
Come on.
Let's dance.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Rose, what are you doing?
I'm diapering a turkey.
It's been so long since I changed a diaper, I figured I'd practice before the baby gets here.
Ma!
Hello, Martha.
Where were you?
I'll give you a hint.
The guest of honor had lipstick on her teeth and didn't give a damn.
Who died?
My best friend, Lydia.
I'm so sorry.
She suffered so.
It was a blessing in disguise.
I always wondered why blessings wore disguises.
If I were a blessing, I'd run around naked.
Oh, that must be the baby.
There's a baby coming?
A couple from my church are going camping over the weekend, and we get to take care of the baby.
Good.
Maybe now you'll get some food I can chew.
How about a cup of tea, Martha?
A little.
I made a pig of myself at the funeral.
It was nice.
Everybody had a good time.
I'm going to miss her so much.
I know.
But you said yourself, the last few weeks were so hard on her.
At least now she's resting peacefully.
I feel so bad.
Hey, I'm the one who should feel bad.
Lydia and I were wearing the same dress.
Honey, can we go now?
I've been planning this for months - a weekend alone in the woods.
It's going to be perfect.
It sounds romantic.
Maybe you'll have another baby.
I'd better make sure we packed everything.
Well, thanks again.
Goodbye, Francis.
You be good now.
Now, don't you worry about a thing.
What a beautiful little thing.
Yes.
What is it, Rose?
A boy or a girl?
Of course!
I mean, is it Frances as in Francie, or Francis as in Frank?
I don't know.
It's wearing yellow.
We could find out, Rose.
How?
Put on the Dolphins game and see if it watches.
By looking, Rose!
We could change its diaper, and see if it has a winky.
A "winky"?
That's the scientific term for it, when it's little.
But the baby isn't wet.
We'll change it anyway.
Here you go.
Here I go?
The best time to change a diaper is when there's nothing in it.
I'll do it.
You can help me.
OK.
Ready?
One, two, three  Frank.
May I help you, madame?
How d'you know I'm not a mademoiselle?
Because what man in his right mind would leave you to languish on the vine?
If this was Sicily, you wouldn't have any lips left.
Take me to my friend Martha Lamont's table, and try not to fall in love.
Miss Lamont is waiting for you at the bar.
Oh, good.
With luck, she found somebody who'll pay for dinner.
Martha!
You look terrific.
Are those new knee-highs?
It's a new attitude - eat, drink and be merry.
Hey, Jacques.
Gimme a hand, and watch where you put it.
That was better than I thought it would be.
Now I can't wait to get down.
Hi.
Can I get you ladies drinks?
I'll have a Manhattan.
And don't slip me any of the cheap stuff.
I'll have another Harvey Wallbanger.
You've seen quite a bit of Mr. Wallbanger tonight.
I'm celebrating, because I've just had an idea that will change my life.
Order anything you like.
I'm going to have the shrimp cocktail, the cream of mushroom soup, asparagus with hollandaise sauce, and the filet mignon.
I like cholesterol as much as the next guy, but you're never gonna get blood to your feet again.
I'd like to drink a toast.
To Sophia, whom I hope I can count on.
For what?
Get your lips off Harvey and tell me what you want!
Since you mentioned it, I want you to do something for me.
I want you to come over to my place tomorrow night.
What, is it your birthday?
Sophia, there aren't going to be any more birthdays.
What are you telling me?
I have so many things wrong with me - arthritis, high blood pressure, angina, just to mention a few.
Who doesn't?
You can't get into a canasta game unless you have at least two debilitating diseases.
Your table is ready, mesdames.
I don't know, for me it was better the first time.
What do you think?
Right this way, please.
So why do you want me to be at your house tomorrow?
I want you to be there when I kill myself.
What is it, Blanche?
I can't quite make it out.
I think my eyes are tired.
Your eyes are old.
Blanche, when are you gonna admit you need glasses?
I do not need glasses.
My mother didn't need glasses till the day she died.
And then it seemed silly.
What is his temperature, Blanche?
I do not know, Dorothy.
Even with perfect eyesight, nobody can read one of these things.
Oh, my God.
It's 103.2!
The poor baby!
We'd better contact his parents.
They're out in the woods somewh- We'd better call Harry.
We're very lucky we have a pediatrician right down the street.
No, that's a bad idea.
Why?
Because by the time I get my hair done and my face on, that baby could be in serious trouble.
Let's call his real pediatrician.
OK.
Pediatrician.
Pe Here it is.
Dr. Harry Weston.
Oh, God!
Oh, come on, Blanche, he's a doctor.
He's used to seeing people at their worst.
And if you comb your hair, you can be right in that ball park.
Harry?
Dorothy.
Listen, I'm so sorry I have to call you at home, but we're taking care of the Lillistrand baby, and he's running a very high fever.
Could you come over right away?
No, this is not Blanche playing a joke.
Thanks, Harry.
Thanks very much.
He's coming?
Right away.
I'd better freshen up.
Blanche, he is not coming over to look at you.
He's coming over to look at the baby.
I will be holding the baby, next to my bosom.
What a magnificent picture.
God, I wish that thing didn't look so sickly.
I don't care if you are paying for dinner.
What you wanna do is crazy.
It's time to go, Sophia.
I don't want to see another Monday.
I don't want to wait, and end up going like Lydia.
I'm going to decide when it's over.
I always thought somebody named God did that.
You don't understand.
I'm afraid of the pain, of the hurting.
I'm afraid of being alone, of dying alone.
I can take the pills myself, but I want you to be there and hold my hand.
You're right, I don't understand.
I'd do anything to stay alive.
If my heart stopped beating, I'd want every doctor in town jumping up and down on my chest.
You say that now, but I don't have the courage to die by inches.
I'm going to do it, whether you're there or not.
I don't want to die alone.
Please, help me.
Dorothy, do you think this looks alluring and yet nurselike?
I don't know, Blanche.
Maybe the earrings put it over the top.
Oh, no, I did that for the baby - they love shiny things.
Listen, maybe you two oughtta wait in the kitchen with the kid.
Oh, I'll get it.
Freeze!
Don't go near that door.
Gimme that thing.
Hello, Frank, darling.
How do I look?
It's all wrong, Blanche.
The baby doesn't match your shoes.
Hello, ladies!
Oh, Harry, thanks so much for coming over.
Frank!
Frank, talk to me.
What's going on here?
He isn't feeling very well, so we thought we'd have you over for a drink.
Hey, why don't we just forget the baby and go dancing?
Oh!
Blanche, that is some outfit!
What do you call that?
A negligee.
Brings back fond memories.
My mother used to have one just like it.
Here, take him - he's wet.
Well, somebody better change him, or he'll get a rash on his winky.
We're sorry we had to disturb you, Harry, but he's running a fever of 103.
What do you think it is?
He could be teething, it could be the flu.
Maybe he's just a hypochondriac.
Really?
Well, let's take a look.
So, you've been keeping these ladies busy, have you?
Oh, I didn't mind.
I have such a highly developed maternal instinct.
Uh, I was talking to the baby, Blanche.
Any other symptoms?
Rash or?
No, he was fine one minute, and running a fever the next.
Is it the usual?
Huh?
Yeah.
Frank tends to get ear infections from time to time.
Is he gonna be all right?
He'll be fine.
We'll keep a close watch on him.
Give him four drops of this right now, and then once every two hours.
Give him plenty of fluids so he doesn't get dehydrated.
And I'll check back on you tomorrow.
When are we supposed to sleep?
Not that I mind.
I was born to heal.
Heel, Blanche!
Welcome back to motherhood, ladies.
I'm sure you were good mothers and you remember what to do.
Blanche, watch the others.
You look like you pick up things quickly.
Gotta go.
Bye.
What is wrong with this baby?
Honey, darling, please shut up for Aunt Blanche!
You know, back in St. Olaf, we had a surefire method for getting babies to sleep.
If herring, elk, or anyone named Sven figures in this, I don't wanna hear it.
OK, I've got another one.
Whenever my kids couldn't sleep, we always sang to them.
A lullaby?
Sort of.
"Mr. Sandman".
Oh, I don't know, Rose Dorothy, come on.
It's worth a try.
It's either we sing or he sings.
Oh, all right.
Boom Boom Well?
Well what?
After my "boom" comes your "boom," and then yours - until we're all "boom"ing.
How complicated is that herring thing?
Boom Boom, boom, boom Boom, boom, boom, boom Boom Boom, boom, boom, boom Boom Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom Boom Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom Mr. Sandman Bring me a dream Boom, boom, boom, boom Make him the cutest that I've ever seen Boom, boom, boom, boom Give him two lips like roses and clover Boom, boom, boom, boom Then tell him that his lonesome nights are over    Mr. Sandman  Yes?
Bring me a dream Make him the cutest that I've ever seen Give him the word that I'm not a rover Then tell him that his lonesome nights are over Mr. Sandman I'm so alone Boy, you guys really stink.
We were just singing the baby to sleep.
It was waking me up.
Maybe we ought to go out in the kitchen.
So we can talk.
So we can eat.
Better.
Ma, we're sorry our singing woke you.
It wasn't you.
I had a horrible nightmare.
I dreamt my Uncle Giuseppe came down from heaven and was pointing a finger at me.
I think it was a finger.
And he was warning me - if I did a certain thing, I wouldn't get into heaven.
What thing?
Try murder.
It was just a dream, Sophia.
It's not just a dream for me.
Martha wants to commit suicide, and she wants me to be there with her.
And what did you say?
I said I'd think about it.
You can't say no to somebody who pops for a $75 dinner.
Tell them, Blanche.
Ma, I can't believe that you're seriously considering getting involved in this!
Martha's a sick woman.
And she doesn't wanna get any sicker.
She's gonna do it anyway, so why should she die alone?
This is wrong, Sophia.
Forget about whether this is right or wrong.
Ma, I'm worried about you!
When Martha takes those pills or whatever and the life drains out of her, you're gonna be in that room, alone.
What are you gonna do, Ma?
How are you gonna feel?
I don't know, but I'll deal with it.
When my time comes, I sure want somebody to put me out of my misery if something tragic happens - like I get a fatal illness, or I've lost my looks.
Tell us when, Blanche.
Ma, I forbid you to do this.
Sometimes you forget - I'm the mother here.
That has nothing to do with this.
It has everything to do with this.
In the 25 years I have on you, I've learned something.
I just wish I could remember what it is.
Oh, yeah, I got it.
It's not whether you agree or disagree with somebody.
It's whether you can be there for that person when they need you.
Sophia, I can't believe you're doing this.
You know, this reminds me of the story of Gunilla Ulf's daughter, St. Olaf's very own angel of death.
Tell it, Rose.
Tell it.
Really?
All the way through?
All the way through.
But please try to make the end come as close to the beginning as possible.
Well, Gunilla Ulf's daughter was a nurse at Cedars of St. Olaf Hospital.
One night she was taking care of Sven Bjornsson, and he asked her if she would get him some more mouth moisteners and then kill him.
Gunilla brought the mouth moisteners right away, but the killing thing seemed to go against everything she'd been taught.
You're doing beautifully, Rose.
He begged and he begged, and by her coffee break, she couldn't stand it anymore, so she pulled the plug and he died.
Well, she was racked with guilt that night.
Not only had she parked her car in a doctor's spot, but she was never sure whether Sven's pleading was the pain talking, or the medication talking, or the guy in the next bed talking!
You see, the guy in the next bed was Ingmar von Bergen, St. Olaf's meanest ventriloquist.
Rose, we are going somewhere with this, aren't we?
I mean, if not, I'm gonna cut out your tongue.
Yes!
Sven came back to haunt Gunilla - since then, every Tuesday night at ten.
Nine, Central time.
Oh!
She hears noises.
Some say it's the wind, but some say it's Sven's voice whispering back from the other side, saying, "Turn around quick - his lips are moving".
You see that, Ma?
You kill someone, you end up being a Rose story.
Is this what you want?
Dorothy, I'll worry about me later.
I gotta do this.
Goodnight, pussycat.
You came.
I said I would.
Come in.
Come in and sit down.
I have something to show you.
Look, ten carats, and not a flaw.
I bought it today, on time.
Very nice.
Look, I was thinking, maybe you shouldn't go through with this No, I have to go.
I've never felt so happy.
Do you like the ring?
Reminds me of a doorknob I had back in Brooklyn.
What are you doing?
Just my way of saying thank you.
Well, I think I've taken care of everything.
Now, you'll see to it that they don't put lipstick on my teeth.
Don't worry.
I'll take them out and check them personally.
Well I guess it's time to go.
You will hold my hand?
Sure I will.
I'm so glad I don't have to go alone.
Uh d'you remember how we met?
Yes.
About eight years ago.
We shared a room in the hospital.
You had the heart scare, I was the gall bladder.
They gave you my sponge bath by mistake.
You ate my Jell-O.
It was a horrible little room.
We couldn't wait to get out of it.
Because we wanted to live.
Yes.
I remember.
Remember better.
Remember life.
I don't have much of one.
I'm not like you.
You live with friends and family, holidays and warmth.
I hear the silence.
We'll talk.
We'll talk all the time.
You can come over Thanksgiving, Christmas, every Friday night.
I may not be there, but you could always talk to Rose.
No, I want to go.
Lydia looked so peaceful.
We're not in this life for peace!
You're crying!
No, I'm not.
I don't cry.
I can see your tears.
I can see yours.
Know what that tells me?
What?
You're not as ready to die as you think you are.
You still wanna live, kid.
Some kid!
I don't know what to do.
That's the point.
If you're not sure, you can't change your mind tomorrow.
You wanted me to be here for your death.
How about letting me be here for your life?
Like a friend?
Like a best friend.
Dorothy, honey, sit down.
Pacing isn't gonna help.
I just can't stop thinking about Ma.
Look at that!
Perfect - 98.6.
Yeah, that's what it looks like to me.
Thank God!
That means he's better.
Here.
I'm pooped.
I guess there must be a reason why women have babies when they're 20ish instead of 40ish.
Blanche, the only thing in this room that's 40ish is your hairdo.
Ma.
It's OK.
She changed her mind.
Oh, Ma, Thank God!
I know, Dorothy.
I know.
That must be the Lillistrands.
Frank, we love you, but you are out of here.
Gimme a minute.
Sure.
Listen, you.
You're just starting out.
You're in for the long haul.
Keep your seat belt on - there are lots of twists and turns.
Stop that, or they're gonna come in here and sing again!
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Oh, girls, I'm so sorry to be late.
I ran out of gas on the way home.
It was just horrible.
Nobody would stop to help me.
This could never have happened in the Old South.
What has become of chivalry, when men used to open doors for you, pull out your chair, tip their hat, kiss your hand, help you down out of your carriage, leave calling cards on little silver salvers?
So how far back do you want to go?
Do you still want to be able to vote?
I cannot believe I ran out of gas.
I checked my tank yesterday.
It was half full.
Maybe the gauge is broken.
It's all those foreign cars.
They're unreliable.
Ma, Blanche drives a Buick.
So?
I'm from Sicily.
To me a Buick is a foreign car.
Oh, but I haven't told you my wonderful news.
My mother-in-law died.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Well, I'm not.
I loathed Mama Devereaux, and the feeling was entirely mutual.
Till the day George died, she always introduced me as his first wife.
I just hope the old witch went slowly.
I sense the period of mourning is over.
Oh!
I didn't tell you my really good news.
Better than the dead mother-in-law?
Yes.
George's younger brother Jamie is flying in tomorrow from Charleston to help settle my part of the estate.
You and Jamie were close?
We were classmates in high school.
I thought he was cute, but I could never date someone from my own class.
Well, I'd been dating seniors since I was 12.
I had my reputation to consider.
Shut up, Ma.
After George and I were married, I began to realize that Jamie had this yen for me.
Poor boy.
Trapped in a seething cauldron of forbidden passion for his gorgeous sister-in-law.
There were nights when he actually bayed at the moon.
But he finally realized that I was totally committed to George, so he threw himself into a marriage that was doomed to failure.
After 20 years they realized they had nothing in common.
I can't wait for him to get here and see how good I look.
You know, Blanche, Jamie may not see this as a happy reunion.
I mean, after all, he just lost his mother.
And I just ran out of gas, but life goes on.
In my village in Sicily we had a custom.
If your mother-in-law died, you were forced to wear a hair shirt, eat dirt and pound your head on a rock.
Anything to keep you from laughing.
I just don't believe I'm about to see Jamie again.
Last time I saw him was at George's funeral.
'Course, I didn't look all that good.
Red is such a bad color on me.
You wore red to George's funeral?
George liked red.
I thought I looked terrible, but the pictures came out fine.
Oh, that must be him.
How do I look, girls?
Nervous.
I am nervous.
My heart's just pounding away.
Just take a deep breath.
I always take a deep breath before I greet a man.
It thrusts my breasts forward.
Blanche!
Honey, you always did look pretty when you held your breath.
Jamie!
Why do you look so stricken?
It can't be because Mother's dead.
You two could never stand the sight of each other.
I had forgotten how much you look like George, how much you sound like him.
I can't help it.
I'm his brother.
Aren't you gonna introduce me?
To who?
Oh!
Where are my manners?
Jamie, these are my friends Dorothy and Rose.
Ladies, in her all-too-infrequent letters, Blanche has spoken of you in glowing terms.
I feel real lucky to get the chance to know you personally.
Why, thank you, kind sir.
You'll have to excuse Rose.
Every time a man speaks Southern at her, she goes all stupid.
Oh, Jamie, it's so good to see you again.
Well, I'm glad to see you too, even if it is only for the weekend.
The business with the will shouldn't take long.
I shouldn't think so.
I'd hardly expect Mama Devereaux to leave me the family silver.
As her executor, I had to go over her will with her - the list of beneficiaries - and, well, she was pretty far gone by then, but when we got to your name, she kept repeating in this weak little voice, "I want her to have it.
I want her to have it".
Well, I am surprised.
She was talking about her disease.
Well, I've got to get back to the hotel.
Blanche has consented to have lunch with me.
Would you ladies care to join us?
Oh, no, that's all right.
You two probably have a great deal to talk over.
It was a pleasure to meet you.
See y'all later.
It was our pleasure, Jamie.
See y'all.
Blanche, I love the girls, but they don't seem as old as you said.
It's the lighting.
What a charming man.
And so handsome.
As they say in St. Olaf, va-va-va voom!
Is that where that comes from?
I better be on my way.
It's my day to get groceries.
God, I hate going to the supermarket.
Rose, if you'd stop playing express-line detective, people would stop yelling at you.
Oh, I see.
So when you're standing in line reading TV Guide and you toss it on top of your ten items, I should look the other way.
I think not, Dorothy.
Dorothy, my car is gone.
What?
My car.
It's been stolen.
Oh, come on, Rose.
Slow down.
You probably just forgot where you parked it.
I'm telling you, it's been stolen.
I'm gonna call the cops.
Hold it.
Rose, don't call the police.
How come?
Because they told you never to call again.
Call the neighborhood patrol.
If it actually was stolen, one of their cars will probably spot it.
The phone book is missing.
The car's missing, the phone book is missing.
If you had a car phone, this would all come together.
Dorothy, you might show a little compassion.
Catch me on a day when the story's about me.
What's with Rose?
Rose thinks her car's been stolen.
No, it hasn't.
It's parked right outside.
Ma's right.
Well, it wasn't there a minute ago, I swear it.
How can it be gone one minute and back the next?
I think I know.
Ma, why are you carrying that phone book?
I can carry a book.
It's a free country.
Even the Statue of Liberty carries a book.
You were driving again.
Who says?
This phone book is still warm.
You were sitting on it so you could see over the steering wheel.
You know me - safety first.
You stole my car?
Only for a couple of hours.
If I had asked, would you have said yes?
No.
There you go.
That is why Blanche ran out of gas.
You'd been driving her car, hadn't you?
Do you know how embarrassing it is to drive a car with a bumper sticker that says: "So many men, so little time"?
But Ma, you don't have a license.
I have a license.
It expired years ago.
I went down and had it renewed.
Look, I absolutely forbid you to do this.
Why?
Because you drive like Mr. Magoo.
I don't understand why suddenly, out of the blue, you decided to start driving again.
I had a blind date.
Actually, he's just legally blind.
It's Mr. Panioli.
He's good-looking, a lot of laughs and he can't see his own hand in front of his face.
He's happy just as long as I brush my teeth.
Sophia, if you needed a ride, we'd be happy to give you lifts.
You want to make me happy?
Get rid of the Bobby Vinton tapes.
I have enough trouble staying awake at the wheel.
Listen, Ma, I didn't want to say this, but I'm going to.
Your eyesight is not what it used to be, and neither are your reflexes, and I want you to make me a promise.
If ever you want to drive, you come to me, let me know, and I'll go with you.
Do you promise?
Promise?
Why don't you ask me to sign it in blood?
What happened to trust?
You don't want me to drive a car, fine, but don't ask me to promise.
Don't humiliate me.
Leave me with what little dignity I have left.
Ma, I'm sorry.
Of course I trust you.
What a pigeon.
Oh, my God.
If they want to make spies talk, they should force them to grade junior-high English essays.
Kids today can't write the English language.
"The characters in The Grapes of Wrath are so real that it's interesting".
Weren't they?
Afternoon, all.
How was your lunch with Jamie?
It was magical.
We talked for hours all about George - how George loved me, how George could never take his eyes off me, how George used to save his money so he could buy presents good enough for me.
Oh, it felt so good talking about George.
It almost seemed to bring him back to life, and it made me realize why, from the time I laid eyes on him till the day he died, there was never, never another man in my life.
Blanche, you?
You were never tempted?
Never.
Didn't you have your milk delivered?
The uncanny thing is how much like George Jamie is, and it's not just that he looks and talks like him.
He's gentle like George, and he's thoughtful like George.
He's smart and funny like George.
Sometimes I get this eerie feeling that George has walked right back into my life.
Oh, Rose, Dorothy, I'm falling in love.
Novelty night.
What's more, my female instincts tell me that Jamie feels the same way about me.
Oh, it wouldn't surprise me if one day soon Mrs. Blanche Devereaux were to become Mrs. Blanche Devereaux.
I'll alert the mailman.
Don't you think it's crazy that Blanche is actually gonna marry Jamie?
Why?
They practically grew up together.
Rose, they've known each other most of their lives so it's very comfortable.
He's like an old friend.
But he's her late husband's brother.
I remember back in St. Olaf when Inga Engstran married her late husband's brother Lars, and the whole town was shocked.
That could've been because at the time Inga was on trial for her late husband's dismemberment.
It was probably a factor.
The trial went on for months.
Attorney's fees cost her an arm and a leg.
Rose, get to where they steal the brain out of the dead body and sew it into your head.
So anyway, she got a suspended sentence.
They let her go?
No, they hanged her.
I'm going to sleep.
I don't know how long I've got, but I deserve better company in my final years.
Good night, Ma.
Now, you know, Rose, I think Blanche has the right idea marrying someone she knows.
It makes it a lot easier, sharing a history together.
It helps knowing each other's idiosyncrasies.
I don't think Stan and I would have gotten together had I known that his entire family smells their fingers all day after they eat chicken.
Well, I still think Blanche is making a terrible mistake.
And what mistake might that be, pray?
Trusting that her friends won't badmouth her behind her back?
Oh, honey, that's not it.
We're a family.
And when a close member of the family thinks that she might move out, well, even though we might be happy for her, it's a little upsetting.
Well, if you're worried about the house, don't be.
Even if I move to Charleston, I'll make arrangements for you-all to stay here as long as you like.
Blanche, that's so sweet of you.
Oh, Blanche, that's not what concerns us.
It's not?
We're concerned about losing you.
Oh, right.
I don't want to lose you either.
Wait a minute.
I have a wonderful idea.
Why don't you all come to Charleston and live with me?
No, we couldn't do that.
Of course you can.
It's all settled.
I don't want to hear another word.
Why, you know, it's an old Southern tradition for the beautiful married daughter to take in her pathetic spinster sisters.
Well, when she puts it that way, it's so hard to resist.
Finished.
I have graded the last paper.
D minus?
You're gonna give the poor kid a D minus?
That's because substitute teachers aren't authorized to impose the death penalty.
Well, since Blanche is having dinner with Jamie, we have a very important decision to make.
How about pizza?
Sounds great.
Should we go healthy and get whole-wheat crusts and low-fat cheese?
Why don't we go really high-fiber and spread ketchup on cardboard?
Pizza, dammit!
Get pizza.
That's funny.
The phone book is missing again.
Wait a minute.
Where's Ma?
Is my car gone?
Hey, your car is fine.
My car is gone.
Yes?
Yes, she does.
It's the police.
There's been an accident.
You promised me you wouldn't drive alone.
Ma, I can't believe you lied to me.
I've been lying to you all your life.
Did you ever get that yellow pony I promised you when you were six?
You're not taking this accident very seriously.
No one was hurt.
It was the other guy's fault.
I have a witness.
Your witness is Mr. Panioli.
He's legally blind.
He'll say what I tell him.
What's the big deal?
Ma, you should not be driving.
You want to take away my license?
And your telephone book.
It's for your own good, Ma.
You're ruining my life.
One of us could drive you anywhere you want to go.
Oh, sure, I really want you along on dates.
Ma, will you try to be reasonable?
Sheila Patterson's daughter lets her drive.
I'm not Sheila Patterson's daughter.
You can't treat me like this.
I'm going to my room.
Oh, Ma.
I have the strangest sense of dÃ©jÃ  vu from when I was 14, except I'm Ma and she's me.
What are you gonna do about her?
I've got to be firm.
I'm not gonna let her go to the prom.
I never will forget back in high school in biology class when we were studying the octopus.
Now, I swear I meant to say eight tentacles.
No, you didn't.
Any girl who says that and doesn't blush knows what she's saying.
You were the only thing that kept me awake in biology class.
To old friends.
Oh, I wish you weren't leaving tomorrow.
So do I. Well, then, don't.
Stay on a few more days.
I've got a meeting with a client on Monday morning.
Then I'll go back to Charleston with you.
Say again.
Look, I know how I feel about you, and I flatter myself to think that you feel the same way about me.
Now, I could be coy, I could drop hints, but I'm past that.
Jamie, when George died I began to feel incomplete.
I tried to find what was missing, I tried to find it in another man.
Men.
Many, many men.
But it just wasn't there, and then you happened, and it was as if George had just stepped right back into my life again.
I just don't want to feel that incompleteness again.
Oh, just listen to me.
Am I carrying on?
I don't know what got into me.
No, I said I was not going to be coy, and I'm not.
I'm gonna say what I mean, what I feel.
I'm in love with you, Jamie.
Well, Blanche, darling I do feel something for you.
I think maybe I always have.
I knew it.
But I don't believe it's love, not the way you mean it.
The only thing we've talked about tonight and ever since I got here is George.
Now, I loved him too, I looked up to him, I tried to be just like him but I couldn't.
I couldn't be him then and I can't be him now.
You're in love with the memory I brought back to you.
Well, I certainly am not.
I am well in touch with my feelings and I certainly know my own mind, George.
Now, you've just been talking nonsense.
Take it back this second.
Jamie.
What?
You called me George.
Well don't you think I would know if I had called you Jamie, George?
I mean I mean George, Jam Oh, well, Jamie, George, what's the difference?
There is a difference, Blanche.
You're just so much like him.
But I'm not him.
I feel like a fool.
Oh, Blanche, honey.
It's never foolish to hold on to a memory.
Sometimes it's all we're left with.
I miss him so much.
I know.
I miss him too.
Morning, everybody.
Blanche, are you OK?
I stopped crying a couple of hours ago.
I've been waiting for the puffiness to disappear.
We were worried about you.
Well, I just cried and cried, and then I finally realized what I'd been crying about.
It wasn't about me and it wasn't about Jamie.
It was about George.
And I cried enough for George when he died so I decided to rejoin the living.
That's our Blanche.
I think I'll take a stroll past that new mini mall they're building.
Why?
Passing construction sites is good for your morale.
The sound of guys in hard hats making that sucking noise through their teeth makes me feel like a lady again.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Thank you.
Oh!
A person cannot open a letter anymore without being accosted by some vile, disgusting thing!
I thought it was against the law to send filth through the mail.
Oh, no.
What is it, Blanche?
A letter from the IRS.
I am being audited!
It's aggravating, yes, but you don't have anything to be worried about.
Do you?
Well, of course not.
But you know how nitpicky they can be if you forget to dot an i or you don't declare the tiniest little thing they can blow it all out of proportion.
What didn't you declare, Blanche?
You.
Me?
And Rose and Sophia.
I think over the past five years I might have forgotten to mention that y'all were living here with me and paying rent.
We just slipped your mind?
Of course not, darling.
But you know I think of you girls as family.
Now, how would it look if they thought I was charging my own family rent?
Honest.
Don't you ever get nosebleed from taking the highroad all the time?
Oh, this is such an upsetting day.
For both of us.
Why?
What's wrong with you?
I ran into an old friend from high school.
Helen Colquist - she just moved to Miami.
We spent some time together and decided we'd get together today.
I even got out the old yearbook so we could go down memory lane.
Last night she had a heart attack and died.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I've been sitting here looking through the book, and I can't believe how many of my classmates are gone.
Look.
Frank Bonatardi, tight end on the football team - heart attack, dead.
Don't think of it as Frank being dead.
Just think of it as God telling Frank to go deep.
David Brittingham.
What happened to him?
God told David to drive into a wall at 80 miles an hour.
What are you doing?
Dorothy's going through her yearbook, to see who's dead.
That's my pussycat: fun, fun, fun!
Ma, do you remember Helen Colquist?
Was she that fat woman with a wooden leg and a hairless cat named Cincinnati Jake?
No.
Then I don't remember her.
Oh, Ma, look at this.
A list I made of things I wanted to do with my life.
You know, I had a list like that - and I've done most of 'em.
Except for Burt Lancaster.
I haven't done half the things on this list.
I mean, what am I?
I am a substitute teacher.
I'll never be rich before I'm 21, I'll never be homecoming queen.
You can still be homecoming queen.
It'll just be a different kind of home.
What else is on your list, Dorothy?
Uh I wanted to entertain people.
Oh!
You, an entertainer?
Well, yes.
I was in the drama club.
I was also voted the most humorous girl in my class.
She went to a special school for the dull.
I did not.
OK, it's time for dinner.
Dorothy, tell me something else that's on your list.
An entertainer!
Entertaining people, getting my masters, and I wanted to sleep with Michael Delvecchio.
Wait a minute.
Michael Delvecchio?
Is he tall with black hair, has a mole on his cheek, sells insurance in New York City?
Yes!
You didn't miss much.
The point is, I didn't do any of the things on my list.
I mean, all my dreams went unfulfilled.
The other day I was talking to Helen Colquist.
She said she'd always wanted to go to the Holy Land.
She'd just bought the ticket.
Now she's dead.
Hi.
What a day!
You too?
You know Roger Barton, the man who works in the cubicle next to me?
He doesn't like me.
Everybody's always liked me.
Honey, maybe your chemistry's just off.
Everybody doesn't have to like you.
Oh, yes, they do.
Dorothy, you're the smart one.
Blanche, you're the sexy one.
And Sophia, you're the old one.
I'm the nice one.
Everybody always likes me.
The old one isn't so crazy about you.
Roger likes everybody else in the office.
I don't know why he doesn't like me.
I go out of my way to be friendly.
You know that happy thought of the day that I write down and give to everyone?
He doesn't even like that.
I have a plan.
What is your plan?
His dog died.
That your plan?
No.
I'm gonna replace his dog.
Rose, you don't even like bringing me my slippers.
No, I'm gonna get him a new pet to replace his.
His dog lifted his leg on an electric fence.
Poor Sparky.
To show him how sorry I am, I'm gonna go to the pound and get him another pet.
Rose, I really think you're trying too hard.
I don't.
I don't.
No, Rose, I admire you.
When you want something to happen, you go for it.
Me, I dream.
Are you back on that show biz kick again?
Yeah, Ma.
I was always pretty good at it, even way back in high school.
Do you remember those variety shows that my class used to put on?
I was really very good.
I'd get up there and tell a few jokes about the teachers, about the cafeteria food.
Ma, do you remember, "You call this tapioca"?
Timeless.
The kids really liked me.
I mean, they laughed.
I felt great.
If there's something you're aching to do, then you simply have to do it.
Remember when we went to amateur night at the Comedy Barrel?
You've got to be as good as some of those people.
I couldn't.
I'd be up there sweating bullets.
And dodging some.
No, you should try it, Dorothy.
We'd be right there, front and center, cheering you on.
This is crazy.
What if I die out there?
Oh, who cares if you stink.
Who cares if nobody laughs.
Who cares if you make a fool of yourself.
I care.
Then you got problems.
Coming.
Roger!
Roger, I can't tell you how sorry I am about what happened to Sparky.
And how are you?
I've been better, Rose.
I've come to talk to you about this cat you sent me.
When I saw him at the pound, I knew he'd be just the cat for you.
I named him Buster.
Isn't he precious?
He mauled me, Rose.
Buster did that?
But he seemed so sweet.
Well, he may be, Rose, but he just doesn't like me.
Sometimes in life that happens.
For instance, I don't like you.
But everybody likes me.
Can't say that anymore, Rose.
Do you really hate me?
Oh, yeah.
Now, here's Buster back.
You told me you were an animal lover.
I thought maybe I could replace your loss.
Well, I didn't need a replacement.
You see, I had my parakeet.
Or I used to have him until you sent that cat from hell into our lives.
You don't mean?
I don't think you're gonna have to feed Buster for a while.
Goodbye, Rose.
And when you see me at work, don't say good morning, don't leave me those cheery notes, and please don't put on those little puppet shows over the partition.
In fact, don't ever think of me again.
Oh!
Whose cat is this?
I got it at the pound for somebody, and now they don't want him.
I was talking to Sarah Antonelli the other day.
She's got a cellar full of mice and she needs a cat.
You think this guy's got the killer instinct?
Oh, I think so.
Please take him, Sophia.
His name is Buster.
He sure is cute.
I love the way he's got that jaunty yellow feather behind his ear.
Kitty, kitty, kitty!
What's in the shoebox?
Every last receipt and scrap of paper I have collected over the last five years.
Or a pair of shoes.
What am I going to do?
I'm meeting with my accountant tomorrow.
He said to bring everything.
You better include a cake with a file in it.
Where are your receipts?
I always thought you only needed a receipt if the dress you bought didn't fit.
I'm just no good at this.
That's beginning to shine through.
It was so much easier when I was married.
I'd buy something expensive, George would yell at me, I'd put on a see-through nightie, and that would be the end of it.
Why can't the government work that way?
According to the newspapers, a lot of times it does.
Uh, this money that you forgot to give to the IRS - what did you do with it?
I can't remember what I did with every penny.
I know I gave some of it to charity.
Charitable deductions!
Blanche, that's great.
What was it?
United Fund?
Greenpeace?
You remember?
In 1985 I bought the We Are The World album.
Dorothy, have you seen my teeth?
They're in your mouth, Ma.
I know that.
Don't they look good today?
I ran them through the dishwasher.
Ma, listen to me.
You got Martha Raye and Madge mixed up again.
Oh, yeah.
Listen, Ma, would you like to listen to a joke?
Is this from your act?
Could be.
I went down to the Comedy Barrel and signed up for Monday night.
Let me try this out on you.
OK, make me laugh.
All right.
Here we go.
It seems there was this doctor-- "It seems" there was?
What is this, existentialist humor?
Was there a doctor, or wasn't there?
Yes.
Yes, there was this doctor.
He's sitting in the park-- What time of year is it?
What difference does it make?
You have to set the scene.
Who is telling this joke?
At the moment, nobody.
Ma, it would be very nice if you could be supportive.
Please.
I've always been supportive.
Remember when you wanted to run away to Canada so you wouldn't get drafted?
Ma, that was my brother Phil.
Oh, yeah.
I got confused - he was wearing your dress.
OK.
How about when you were unmarried and pregnant?
I remember your exact words: "Get out of my house.
You're dead.
I have no daughter named Dorothy".
Sure, in that tone of voice it sounds bad.
But I'm supporting you now.
Didn't I come here to live with you in your twilight years?
Ma, these are your twilight years.
Are you kidding?
I'm supposed to be dead.
These are your twilight years.
Ma, I never needed you more.
I'm about to do something that is very important to me.
I mean, I could fall flat on my face.
Fall the other way - it's funnier.
Thank you and good night.
Well, Ma?
Five minutes and ten seconds.
That's a little long.
What should I cut?
After hearing that act, your throat.
Hi, Blanche.
How did it go at the accountant's?
Oh, just fine.
While I was in the waiting room, I was reading a magazine that listed the ten richest men in America.
You know, Merv Griffin's moved up a couple of notches.
He probably ate the two guys ahead of him.
Anyway, I got good news from my accountant.
I'm being audited Tuesday.
Oh, lucky you.
You don't get it.
My accountant reminded me that I've been audited before and I've never had to pay a penny in back taxes.
I have a way with auditors.
The last time I was audited I got money back from the government.
Blanche, it's not a refund when the auditor leaves two twenties on your nightstand.
D'you wanna see my vanskap kokker?
As long as I don't have to show you mine.
It's a St. Olaf friendship cake.
I'm taking it to Roger.
It's made with milk, sugar, honey, a whole lot of love, and just a drop of sunshine.
Why don't you leave the poor man alone?
I know if he got to know me, he'd like me.
Why?
I got to know you - I don't like you.
You just say that.
Repeatedly.
Rose, you've become obsessed.
You have this irrational need to get Roger to like you.
Why are you doing this?
I guess it all started when I was a little kid at the orphanage.
You see, only the happy, nice kids got adopted.
That's when I started trying to be happy and nice all the time.
'Cause the truth is, if you treat somebody really nicely, they'll take you home.
I've always found that to be true.
Right now, I feel like the kid at the orphanage.
OK, Rose, I'm going to tell you a story about a young girl in high school who was very insecure about the other kids liking her.
Now, she would do anything - anything - to gain their approval.
She would do their homework for them, while her grades suffered.
She would give them her lunch money, in the misguided belief that she could buy their acceptance.
Finally, lonely and desperate for affection she gave her virginity to the first boy who showed her the slightest attention.
Oh, boy.
You know, Blanche, until you told this story, I never realized how much we had in common.
We don't have anything in common.
That was a story Sophia told me about you.
Rose, the point is, there's always going to be somebody who doesn't like you.
Yes, and when you find that one person, you have to try even harder to get them to like you.
Did I ever tell you the story about Herder Schornborscht?
Many, many, many times.
Yes, yes, yes!
You have.
Well, then you remember, he was St. Olaf's most famous shepherd.
Well, Herder used to say, you can have a hundred sheep, and if one goes astray, that's the one you go look for.
Especially if it's the best-looking one.
Rose has got to find some new role models.
Rose!
I was just thinking about you.
Really?
Yeah, my hand was throbbing.
I brought you a vanskap kokker.
It's a traditional St. Olaf friendship cake.
Rose, I don't want any gifts from you.
I really don't wanna have anything to do with you.
Let me ask you something.
What is your idea of a friend?
A friend is someone who likes you and respects you and is willing to do things for you.
So if I was your friend, you'd be willing to do things for me and respect my wishes?
Of course.
I'd have to.
I've asked you to leave me alone, and you haven't.
What kind of friend is that?
You said you weren't my friend.
What if I say I am your friend?
Well, then I'd have to do it - you'd be my friend.
Then we're friends!
You mean it?
Forever.
Don't forget to leave me alone.
That's what friends are for.
See you, pal.
Thank you, Roger.
You don't know what it means for me to hear you say that.
See you, buddy.
You're looking pale.
Are you all right?
I was thinking, how important is it to fulfill your life's dream?
What's the big deal?
You've come this far.
You might as well go through with it.
But what if nobody laughs?
Then you'll know how Lisa Bonet feels.
OK, OK, who's got number 14?
Oh, God, I do.
OK, sweetie.
You're on next.
So, the guy says, "My St. Bernard?
I thought it was your St. Bernard".
I gotta go wash my mouth out with soap.
Good night, everybody.
There he goes, the bad boy of comedy, Dirty Dicky Hertz.
Not exactly the kind of guy you want to meet your mother.
Now, ladies and gentlemen, I want to bring out a lady who actually claims to know which one is Siegfried and which one is Roy, Dorothy "Show Us Your" Zbornak.
You'll, uh have to excuse me.
I'm a little nervous.
I'm not really a comedian.
Boy, it's a little hot up here.
How hot is it?
I don't know, but it's really hot.
Hi-ho!
As I said before, my name is Dorothy Zbornak.
And that's spelled just the way it sounds.
You're dying.
Ask us where we're from.
That's my mother, the Incredible Shrinking Woman.
She's sitting there with the two other women that I live with.
You know, at our ages, the four of us living together in the same house, we go through so many hormone changes that some nights we can actually read by the hot flashes.
You know, it's really interesting when one of us dates an eligible man - or as we call them, a live one.
Although it's not a prerequisite because I have been known to date a guy on life support.
But the trouble with dating a guy on life support is that you always have to go to his place.
Every guy has an angle.
And that's the trouble with the guys here in Miami.
They simply cannot say those three little words: "Quick, call 911".
So, that's who I am - a substitute teacher with hot flashes who still lives with her mother who heckles her.
And I wanna thank you for finding my life more amusing than I do.
Good night.
Thank you.
You're beautiful.
Pussycat, I've been working on some jokes for your act.
Why did Rose throw the alarm clock out of the window?
I don't know.
Why?
Because she's a moron.
I got a million of 'em.
That's OK, Ma.
I don't think I'm gonna be doing my stand-up routine any more.
How come?
You were great.
This morning I realized that what I've been doing is no different from my dream.
Every time I stand in front of a classroom I face the same challenges, only I come away with something that I didn't feel last night - that maybe, possibly, I've managed to teach them a little something.
Now, doing stand-up was like having sex with Stan.
I was nervous before it, felt pretty good during it, and I'm absolutely thrilled that I will never have to do it again.
How do I look?
Is today your audit?
Yes.
He should be here any minute.
Blanche, how are you going to explain that outfit?
"The zipper's in the back".
Wish me luck.
Blanche Devereaux?
Yes.
Gloria Schmidt, IRS.
Come on in the kitchen.
I'll write you a check.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Mmm!
Morning!
Morning.
Dorothy, taste this.
Mmm!
Oh, Ma, that's wonderful.
Yeah, smells fine to me.
I don't know why they're recalling it.
Good morning.
Morning, Rose.
Wait, there's something different about you.
Didn't you used to have a neck?
It's tension.
It always goes to the same place.
My shoulder's tight and my neck gets stiff and I can't turn my head.
You mean you can't move your neck at all?
No.
Look out, behind you!
Hey, you gotta make your own fun around here.
Honey, what's making you so tense?
It's my job, all the pressure.
What's the big deal?
You're just working for a consumer reporter - you're not actually on TV yourself.
Well, it is a big deal.
All those consumers are depending on me to do a good job.
If I'm not careful, people could get hurt or cheated.
Look, it's Jimmy Smits!
Ma, stop that.
Rose, you're gonna have to learn how to take care of that stress.
You can't walk around in agony.
She's right.
For a bad neck, you get into bed, lie perfectly still and wait until it's over.
Oh, no, I'm sorry.
That's not a bad neck, that's bad sex.
Hi, Mom.
Michael!
Michael!
I can't believe it.
Oh, honey, it is so good to see you.
Everybody, Michael is here.
Look, Rose, it's Michael.
I'm not falling for that again.
Hi, Blanche.
Rose.
Oh, Grandma, you look more beautiful than ever.
Relax, you're already in the will.
Now come give me a hug.
Honey, Michael, I thought you were touring with that band.
Great news, Ma.
I quit.
You quit?
You just got the job two weeks ago.
I know, but I feel like I'm in a rut.
Michael, how are you gonna support your wife?
More good news - Lorraine and I separated.
Sep-- What do you mean?
He means he and Lorraine aren't living together.
I know what he means.
It's just a breather - give each other space.
She threw you out, didn't she?
She changed the locks and everything.
I mean, she even tossed all my clothes out the window.
You can't imagine what it's like, searching for underwear in the back of a convertible.
Tell me about it.
Michael, couldn't you have tried to make it work before you just walked away?
I tried - God knows, I tried - but Ma, she didn't understand who I am.
She didn't understand I'm a free spirit.
And that's why I like to come home - 'cause you understand me.
It's not just because I do your laundry?
Michael, we were just having breakfast.
Would you join us?
That's the best offer I've had all morning.
You know, it wouldn't hurt if you backed your kid up more.
Oh, Ma, it's just that I hate to see Michael making all the wrong choices.
You know what I mean?
How could I know?
My children made all the right choices.
My son was a cross-dresser, my daughter was unmarried and pregnant.
Hell, I was the Rose Kennedy of Brooklyn!
Rose!
Honey, it's three in the morning!
Why are you staring at those light bulbs?
I'm running a consumer test for work.
I have to see which one of these lasts longer.
Rose, you ninny, don't you know staring at light bulbs for hours is bad for your eyes?
Hey, instead of worrying about my eyes, I'd be more concerned with those purple spots all over your face.
Oh, I'm sorry, Blanche.
I'm frazzled.
Not only is this due tomorrow, but I have to make sure this watch really is waterproof.
Honey, why don't you take the watch off your wrist?
Come on, Blanche!
Then I'd have my hand in a bucket of water for nothing.
Rose, listen.
I don't want you to take this the wrong way but you are driving us crazy.
Now, you've got to get some sleep.
How?
There is no way I can relax when I'm so anxious about these work deadlines.
Learn to relax.
I learned how to relax in any situation on that meditation retreat.
You went on a meditation retreat?
Yeah.
Was it successful?
Oh, yes.
By the end of the week 17 men were using my name as a mantra.
OK, how do you meditate?
Well, just shut your eyes.
Now breathe deeply.
Uh-huh.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Good.
I can't.
I'm too wound up.
Blanche!
Which one went out first?
Beats me.
Oh, great.
Now what am I gonna tell Enrique Mas tomorrow?
You are going to tell him that you are overworked.
I can't tell him that.
He'll think I can't do the job.
You can't do it, Rose - not like this.
Now, you talk to him and tell him you have too much to do.
If it means your job, it means your job.
Honey, you can't go on like this - you'll die.
Or we'll kill you.
Well, I'll think about it, Blanche.
But I'm telling you, I'm not ready to give up the most challenging, exciting job I've ever had.
Ma, Ma, listen to this.
"Saxophone player wanted at the Hacienda Hut cocktail lounge".
What do you think?
I guess I could learn.
Ma, not for you - for Michael.
For the past week all he's been doing is hanging out at the beach and having a good time.
Maybe this job at the Hacienda Hut will get him on the right track again.
You don't want Michael working in a place like the Hacienda Hut.
It is full of people just looking for easy sex and cheap thrills.
But if it'll help, I could write a letter of recommendation.
Why push Michael into a job?
Give him time to breathe.
Let him find himself.
Oh, Ma, I'm a little concerned.
He just doesn't take commitment seriously.
Ma, he quits jobs, he leaves relationships.
It's like they don't matter.
He is 30 years old.
When's he gonna grow up?
Why should he, when you make it so easy for him not to?
Are you saying it's my fault?
All I'm saying is, you have to do something, or you're gonna end up with a 60-year-old kid who can't hold a job or have a meaningful relationship, who keeps running to you all the time for emotional support.
Can you imagine a man like that?
No, I can't.
Yes, I can.
Hi.
It's me, Stan.
Come on in, Stanley.
We were just talking about you.
I thought I felt my ears burning.
Maybe that cheap toupee you're wearing retains heat.
Stanley, why are you here?
Michael and I made plans for tonight.
You know, a real father-son evening, where we can rap and share our feelings and create good vibes.
I can dig it.
Where are you taking him?
The Hacienda Hut.
I'll show him the town, give him some quality time.
Maybe it'll make up for never teaching him how to ride a bicycle.
Stanley, how come I've never seen you at the Hacienda Hut?
I never have to stay long.
I'm a chick magnet.
That's why they call me Mr. Lucky.
You mean, for 38 years I was Mrs. Lucky and never knew it?
What about the present Mrs. Lucky?
Does she know what a maggot you are?
Magnet, Dorothy.
Magnet.
Hey, Dad.
I'll be with you in a second.
Ma, could I see you in the kitchen?
Look, Ma, I'm picking up the tab for dinner tonight and I feel kind of bad because I've never treated you.
I mean, I love Dad, but you've always been there for me.
Honey, don't worry.
I'll always be there for you.
I'm glad to hear that, Ma, because I ran out of cash.
I need to borrow $30.
$30?
Michael, you're an adult.
Do you really wanna beg your mother for $30?
All right, fine.
Forget it.
I hate this.
Whenever I need money you make me feel like I'm asking.
All right.
All right, all right, all right.
Oh, but look, all I have are two twenties.
Great.
We can get appetizers.
OK, let's jam.
That's my boy.
That's my dad.
That's my money.
Dorothy, you gave him money again?
Oh!
When are you gonna realize that you will never have a good relationship with your children until you stop doing all the things for them they should be doing for themselves.
Dorothy, I finished your blouse.
And the socks?
Get right on it.
So what am I supposed to do?
You have to make him stand on his own two feet.
If I were you, I'd kick him out.
You really think I should do that?
Kick him out.
I know it sounds hard and cruel, but I've been reading about that very thing.
It's called "rough love".
No, I think it's "tough love".
Well, see there?
We've both come up with something we oughta try.
Michael?
Hi, Ma.
What are you doing up?
Waiting up for you.
I brought you something.
Change for my 40?
No, these little bamboo umbrellas.
These are mine to keep, right?
I stayed up because I want to talk to you.
I want to know how the job hunt is going.
There's not much out there right now.
You're sending out rÃ©sumÃ©s?
Come on, Ma.
Musicians don't send out rÃ©sumÃ©s - it's not like a job job.
No, you're right.
A job job is when you go to work regularly, bring home a paycheck and support yourself.
OK.
Wait a minute.
What's this all about?
Michael, you are 30 years old.
I want you to find your own place, cook your own food, and take responsibility for your life.
But, Ma, that takes money.
That's where the job job comes in.
So what are you saying?
You're kicking me out?
No.
I'm forcing you to grow up.
Fine, I'll pack my things now.
No, wait a minute.
Since I sprung this on you out of the blue, let's say you can stay here for another week.
What, and put off growing up?
Nah.
I'm outta here.
Rose, what the hell are you listening to?
It's a relaxation tape.
The rain is supposed to relax me.
Is it working?
Not really.
I keep worrying that I left my car windows down.
Oh, Dorothy, I feel so helpless.
I get upset every time I think about it.
Now, look, Rose, stop whining.
You're going to have to speak to your boss about your workload.
Wallowing in self-pity is not going to help.
How are you feeling, Dorothy?
My life is falling apart.
And now Rose is bothering me.
Dorothy, I'm sorry I bothered you.
I'm sorry I snapped at you, Rose.
It's just that I'm upset.
I am very upset.
It is because you threw Michael out?
No, it's because I can't make any sense out of those commercials for Obsession.
Of course it's because of Michael.
You just did what you had to.
Blanche, knowing that does not help.
I am going crazy wondering where he is.
I mean, he could be sleeping under a pier, for all I know.
Or in some flophouse.
Or out on the street.
Michael called.
He's staying with Stan.
Oh, God, it's even worse than I thought!
At least he can depend on one of this parents.
Look, Ma, I told you why I know, and you're wrong.
Your brother Phil is much older than Michael and I still send him money.
And do you know why?
Where I was brought up, you never turn your back on family.
Never.
I know, Ma.
When your crazy cousin Nunzio started living with his pet goat, did the family turn its back on him?
No.
And after a couple of nights neither did the goat.
Dorothy, this really isn't your problem anymore.
It's Michael's.
He just has to learn the things we need to know to be an adult.
Like how to earn a living, how to pay the rent, how to be courteous to your Friday-night mistake on Saturday morning.
I still have to work on that last one myself.
Why does it have to be so hard?
The hardest part for me was explaining to my Kirsten the difference between boys and girls.
I knew the time had come, but I kept putting it off.
Finally, I decided it was time to take the bull by the horns.
So you told her?
No, I took the bull by the horns, turned him around and showed her what makes a bull a bull.
You are kidding, Rose?
No!
That's how my mother taught me.
Honey, didn't that give you a false impression about what a man would look like?
It sure did.
Can you imagine my surprise on my wedding night with Charlie?
Boy, that bull would have been jealous.
I just wish somebody could tell me I've done the right thing.
Yeah, yeah, you've done the right thing.
Rose, tell me more about Charlie.
Not now, Blanche.
Dorothy, I know you've done the right thing.
In the animal kingdom, the whole idea is to teach offspring to fend for themselves.
Humans are the only ones who think it's their duty to care for children their entire lives.
You know, Rose, sometimes you really say some wise things.
We're also the only species who use corn holders that look like corn on the cob when we eat corn on the cob.
Oops!
Spoke too soon.
Oh, Rose, is your neck bothering you again?
Yeah.
And I'm gonna do something about it.
I'm glad you've come to your senses.
There is nothing worse than a pain in the neck.
I must be psychic.
Stanley, why are you here?
We need to talk.
Let's go in the kitchen.
Is this private?
No.
I'm hungry - you got any bagels?
Hello, Rose.
OK, Stanley, what do you wanna talk about?
It's about Michael.
What's wrong?
What happened?
Why do you have so many cheesecakes?
What about Michael?
He's fine.
He's living the life of Riley.
I cook his meals, I change his sheets, I pay his bills.
He's making my life miserable, Dorothy.
Stanley, pull yourself together.
I'm sorry.
It's not just the disruption to my life, it's seeing him do nothing with his.
Stanley, you took him in.
Now it is your problem, and you have to deal with it.
You're right.
There's only one thing I can do, and it's the hardest thing.
You're going to ask Michael to leave your home.
No.
I'm gonna ask you to ask Michael to leave my home.
He already resents you.
Why should he be mad at me too?
I've heard enough.
Get out.
See?
You're great at throwing people out.
Stanley, you're going to have to throw your own son out of your own house.
Dorothy, I can't.
How can I sit in judgment of how Michael lives his life?
Here I am, a middle-aged man selling novelties for a living.
Things could've been different if I'd applied myself You could have invented plastic vomit, instead of just selling it.
Exactly.
But Michael's different - he's got real talent.
I don't want to see him waste it.
Then help him, Stan.
How?
Set an example.
Show him that it's never too late to grow up.
You're right.
It is time for me to show some maturity.
I'm gonna be strong, Dorothy - not just for Michael, but for myself.
You know something, Stanley?
This is a side of you I rarely see.
And I must say, it's very attractive.
Really?
You wanna fool around?
Oh, yeah.
More than anything.
What is that?
Sarcasm?
I'm leaving.
More around the eyes.
I'm blending, Enrique.
I want my public to trust me.
Enrique Mas must have honest eyes.
Try number 34.
I heard Ted Koppel uses 34 around the eyes.
Enrique.
Rose.
Do my eyes look honest enough?
I, uh See?
The lady hesitates.
More around the eyes.
Make me Cronkite.
Enrique since I've been working here I can't move my head anymore, my back hurts, I can't sleep, I have trouble digesting food, I see spots before my eyes I'm not a doctor, but I think it could be stress.
Please.
This sounds very important.
We should discuss this over coffee.
Cream and sugar?
And a treat.
Surprise me.
You see, that's part of it.
I can't possibly handle all the things you give me to do.
Oh, I feel like such a failure.
Here you've trusted me with a really important job, and I'm just not doing it.
I know how hard your job is, and how good you are at it.
Until you started working for me, my neck was like that.
Well, no wonder I'm cracking.
I don't want you to crack, Rose.
I need you.
Do you believe that?
Yes.
Enough 34.
Really, Rose, speaking from the heart and not from the makeup, you're the best.
That's why I work you like a dog - out of respect.
Thank you.
But I don't want to kill you.
So I'm going to hire an assistant for you, Rose.
An assistant for me?
I can't believe it!
You can't?
I must be fading.
More 34.
Rose, first thing tomorrow you get your assistant.
I want you to know that Dad asked me to leave.
He said he agreed with you.
I don't get it - you two never agreed about anything.
I guess we both agree that we love you.
Well, you have a funny way of showing it.
Because of this, I had to call the band and beg for my job back.
You got it?
Michael, that's wonderful.
Wonderful?
It's humiliating.
Oh, Michael.
Look, I gotta catch a bus.
You got my laundry?
Michael, I want you to know I think what your mother did was right.
You may not see it now, but you'll realize it later.
Well, I guess this is goodbye.
See?
I came around to your side.
You gave him money, didn't you?
It's not like it's my money.
I took it from your purse.
Oh, Ma, I don't know if he'll ever forgive me.
The day you left me at Shady Pines, do you remember what I told you?
Of course.
You told me you'd never forgive me.
But look at us now.
Everything's fine.
You're saying no matter how bad things are between Michael and me, they'll change?
No.
I'm saying that when Michael is 83 and his retirement home burns down, your Oh.
That's right - you'll be dead.
See you, pussycat.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Blanche.
Your picture's in the paper.
And there's a big article about the Citrus Festival.
What's it say, what's it say?
"Miami will be busy this weekend with ten major conventions".
Listen to this.
"The highlight being the Citrus Festival Ball, "which is being chaired this year by 35-year-old Blanche Devereaux".
How much did that cost you?
I don't have to pay for my compliments.
You went to bed with him?
Twice.
But it's not like I wouldn't have anyway.
Oh, good.
The newspaper's here.
Gimme the classifieds.
Oh, Ma, Ma, you're not gonna answer ads in the personals again, are you?
We got a lot of complaints last time.
Hey, he asked for a single white female who likes to party, and he got one.
No, I need to make some extra money.
What for?
When you get to be my age, the quality of your life changes.
While you're at work, I'm here by myself all day, and it gets lonely.
Oh, Ma.
Maybe I could stay home more.
Or we could get a giant-screen TV.
Oh, Ma, we can't afford that.
That's the thing.
The classifieds are filled with ads from people who couldn't find a hotel this weekend, and want to rent a room anyplace they can.
I'm not opening my home to boarders.
Oh, they usually just turn out to be lowlife trash who'll make a mess, and half the time you can't get your money from 'em.
Which reminds me, Rose, your rent check is late.
Hello?
Yes, she is.
It's for you, Leona.
Who is it?
Your father.
Big Daddy?
Is that you, Big Daddy?
Hello, darling, how are you?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Well, darling, I can't come see you this weekend.
No, no, I mean it.
If it had been any other weekend I know, but I'm queen of a ball.
Ain't that something?
Here, listen to this.
Quote: "The highlight being the Citrus Festival Ball, "which is being chaired this year by 35-year-old Blanche Devereaux".
Twice.
I probably would have anyway, though.
Sorry I can't come see you this weekend, but I'll check in with you on Monday.
I love you too.
Bye.
How is Big Daddy?
I think he's just missing me.
He's a little blue.
But when this festival is over, I'll fly up and spend a few days with him.
Come on.
Look at this, look!
Here's a couple that's willing to pay $400 a night for a room.
$400?
Back in St. Olaf, the most expensive room was $18.50.
And that includes the cow.
All right, Rose.
Why would you want a cow in the room?
It's the law.
Thank you so much.
Oh, everybody get in here!
Come and see what I just got.
What is it, Blanche?
My commemorative plate from the Citrus Festival just arrived.
Can I see it?
Oh, no, darling, don't touch it.
Nobody must touch it.
It is very rare.
Only the five people on the committee get these each year.
Oh, look.
Have you ever seen a more moving piece of art?
Only at Graceland.
See what it says?
Hello?
Who's calling?
Oh, hi.
Hang on.
Blanche, it's your sister, Virginia.
Oh, for goodness Virginia, honey, is that you?
I swear the whole family's coming out of the woodwork.
Guess what?
I'm queen of a ball.
Twice.
Yeah, but I probably would have anyway.
What?
I spoke to Big Daddy just yesterday.
I see.
All right, I'll be there as soon as I can.
Blanche, what is it?
Oh, it's Big Daddy.
He's dead.
Well, if you're as friendly as your skies are, I'd sure love to get together sometime.
All right.
Bye.
I have a flight to Atlanta first thing tomorrow morning.
Blanche, honey, are you sure that you don't want one of us to go with you?
Don't be silly, I'm fine.
I'll just fly up to Atlanta tomorrow morning, tell Big Daddy I love him, and be back here in time to be queen of the ball.
Blanche, you can't do that.
Why not?
Big Daddy isn't dead.
I think Virginia's playing a little practical joke.
What kind of a person plays a joke like that?
You want to play a joke, you ring somebody's doorbell and run away.
Or you shorten the leg on somebody's walker so it wobbles.
Or you arrange for somebody to go on a long car trip with Rose.
You don't tell them their father's dead.
Now, look.
Big Daddy didn't sound sick when I talked to him.
He was just missing me.
That Virginia's always accusing me of not being there when the family needs me.
This is just her way of getting me to rush home.
Believe me, everything's fine.
Well, just the same, Blanche, I think I'd better go to Atlanta with you.
Whatever you want to do.
Ketchup to go on my lima beans.
Why?
Oh, he sometimes ate 'em that way.
He'd make up stories about how that's the way the kings and queens of Europe ate 'em.
He always made it sound so special.
He always made everything sound so damned special.
Oh, God, why didn't I go when he called?
Why didn't I go?
And this is the living room.
Oh, Blanche, it's a lovely home.
I better go check and see if the water for our tea is boiling.
There's so many memories connected to this room.
We used to have our big family reunions in here.
Generations of Hollingsworths would gather round Big Daddy with his bourbon.
While he sat there in front of a roaring fire regaling everybody with stories of the Old South, I'd sneak away up to my room and make out with cousin Abernathy.
The room has that sense of tradition.
Virginia.
Hello, Blanche, Dorothy.
Virginia, so sorry about your father.
Thank you.
Nice of you to come.
I was just going to make tea.
Anybody want anything else?
Oh, not me, thank you.
I'm too upset to eat.
I may never eat again.
Blanche.
Oh, you're right, I should keep up my strength.
Dorothy, something with frosting.
Come here, sister, and give me a big hug.
It's just a little late to be sharing a beautiful moment, don't you think?
Where were you, Blanche?
He wanted you.
He did not sound that sick on the phone.
Besides, I told him I'd be here to see him soon.
And don't you get so righteous with me.
Plenty of times you weren't there for him.
What are you talking about?
Always trying to make me out to be the inconsiderate one.
I remember when you were 16 and didn't come home for Father's Day.
I was away at school.
Oh, yes.
The Good Samaritan Academy for the Knocked-Up.
Two, four, six, eight, all us girls are three months late.
That was wonderful for him.
Didn't hurt him half as much as when you were 18, went off to Europe with that guy, Phil.
It was Philippe.
And Big Daddy understood how romantic it was to go live in Copenhagen with a tortured painter.
He painted houses, Blanche.
You are the one who has never been here for the family.
You.
I have always been here for this family, and how dare you say otherwise.
Everything you do is for Blanche.
To tell you the truth, I am surprised that you even made it to the funeral at all.
Maybe you would have been happier if I hadn't.
Maybe not happier.
But at least this family would be able to grieve for Big Daddy without wondering what is in it for Blanche.
Oh, fine.
You don't have a thing to worry about.
You won't have to think about Blanche.
Because if you're gonna be at that funeral I refuse to go.
OK, I want to go over a few of the house rules.
You share the bathroom with Dorothy's room.
The people across the street are out of town so you can use their pool.
They're friends of ours, so try and pick up after yourselves.
Hello.
Hi.
Oh!
Oh, I'm sorry, but you're not supposed to eat off that plate.
That's Blanche's Citrus Festival plate.
Are you staying here too?
We're in the room at the end of the hall.
I'm Peter, this is my wife, Maddy.
What room are you in?
I'd better check.
Sophia, who are Peter and Maddy and why are they staying in Blanche's room?
Because Dorothy's room and your room are already rented.
Well, where am I gonna sleep?
I could rent you half of my room.
Sophia, you can't do this.
Dorothy said-- Forget about what Dorothy said.
What do you want me to do?
Kick them out?
There's not a room in town.
These people come from a small town in Iowa, much like St. Olaf.
Really?
I don't lie about stuff like this, Rose.
The good people in that town saved and sacrificed so that Peter and Maddy could have one weekend of fun before his operation.
Well, he looks fine.
Oh, tell him that.
Look, call me crazy.
I don't see anything wrong with giving a veteran his last wish, and making some dough.
Well, I guess they can stay.
Thank you, Rose.
Here, take this out there, make sure they pay.
Oh, I don't think it's right to charge them.
Neither do I, but he hates pity.
I understand.
What a tool.
Blanche, if you want to change your mind, there's still time to get to the funeral.
Dorothy, come look at these old pictures.
I'm about ten years old in this one.
Big Daddy just taught me how to ride a horse.
You were quite a little porker back then, weren't you?
I was a little chunky, that's all.
Blanche, the horse's eyes are crossed.
Oh, no.
You were fat.
Every little girl goes through that ugly stage.
Ugly, yes.
But this is ugly and fat.
All right.
You seem to be getting a little bit too much pleasure out of all this.
Sorry, Blanche.
It's just that you've always described yourself as being a great beauty.
It's interesting to see that you were Plump.
fat.
Enough.
I'm sorry.
Fat, fat, water rat, Dorothy.
All right, I'll stop.
I'll stop.
But could I have a copy of this?
All right, I was fat.
I can say it.
But only because I blossomed into the extraordinary woman I am today.
Well, Big Daddy didn't care.
He always said I was beautiful.
He was so proud.
You know, there's nobody to be proud of me anymore, you know what I mean?
Yeah.
You know, when anything good happens to me, I still can't wait to tell Ma.
Listen, Blanche, I think you have to go to the funeral.
You wanted to be there for him, be there for him now.
Don't let this argument with Virginia stand in your way.
Blanche, you're never gonna feel complete until you get to say goodbye.
You don't understand.
If I go to that funeral, he's dead.
Blanche, he is.
Look here.
This is when I was crowned Azalea Queen.
Wasn't I beautiful then?
And you still haven't lost it.
Actually, this picture was taken two years after I lost it.
Oh.
Look.
Aw!
The first marine he found the bean, parlez-vous?
The second marine, he cooked the bean, parlez-vous?
The third marine, he ate the bean, rolled over the submarine Inky-dinky parlez-vous?
Oh, nice people.
Sophia, you didn't say anything about parties in the house.
Oh, so Peter and Maddy are having a few friends over.
We're making a bundle.
Boy, I wish we had thought of putting in a pay toilet.
Hello?
It was Dorothy.
Hide me.
Rose, you answer it.
I'm not gonna answer it.
I don't want to have to lie for you.
It's your daughter.
We're not that close.
You better answer it the next time.
She's gonna get mad.
Hello?
Oh, hello, Dorothy.
No, it didn't ring here.
Why?
No, everything's fine here.
Sophia?
Tell her I'm in church.
She's in church.
I said, she's in church.
No, things couldn't be better here.
How's it going there?
Oh, that's good.
Then I'll see you tomorrow.
Give my love to Blanche.
Bye-bye.
I hate lying!
It goes against my nature.
I guess that's because growing up in St. Olaf, one day every year, they'd gather all the children who lied in the town square and the mayor would point at them.
Uh, you got any glue?
Oh!
Blanche's plate!
What are we gonna tell her?
The truth.
Good.
I just need a few minutes to come up with it.
These are for you, Mama.
Hi, Big Daddy.
I couldn't go home without telling you why I didn't come to your funeral.
Same old reason.
I was being selfish.
Thinking too much about how I was feeling, instead of coming out here to pay my loving respects.
You know, going through those photograph albums yesterday, with Dorothy, I realized that I haven't always been easy to love.
Oh, I was a horrible child.
Rebellious, difficult.
But you always made me feel loved and beautiful.
Even when I did make it hard on you.
I know I haven't always given much back, honey.
I was always so worried about me.
Why, I couldn't even come and see you when you needed me, before you died, 'cause I was all caught up in that old silly ball.
There is no excuse for that.
Although I was the ball queen, did I tell you that?
Oh, that's right, I did.
Well, here I am, all caught up in myself still.
Fighting with Virginia and the rest of the family when we ought to be comforting each other.
I just feel like such a fool.
I would give up everything that I ever thought meant anything to me if I could have one moment with you.
I don't know if love can help you, wherever you are, but if it can, honey, you got it.
'Cause Big Daddy, I do love you so much.
I just wish there was some way I could know you're hearing what I'm saying.
Blanche Oh, Lordy Why, Dorothy, what are you doing?
I'm sorry, honey.
Cab driver says we'd better get going if we want to make our plane.
Big Daddy, you remember Dorothy.
Hello.
Honey, I have to go now.
You're in my prayers.
You take good care of him, Mama.
You hear me?
I love you.
I love you both.
I'm nobody's little girl anymore.
Rose, this was a great weekend!
We made $1700.
So I can get my TV.
And I've worked out what we can tell Blanche about that plate.
I wrote it down.
You be Rose, why don't I be Sophia.
This is what we'll say right after they walk in the door.
"Hi, Blanche.
You look beautiful.
Welcome home.
I love you".
"I broke the plate.
I'm such a clumsy fool".
OK.
Now you can skip down to here.
I'm not gonna do this!
You gotta.
If it's the writing, I can punch it up.
Did you call about buying the Citrus Festival plate?
Yes, I did.
Oh, Rose.
You're beautiful.
How much do you want for it?
Well, they're pretty rare.
There's only five of these.
I'd say $2000.
$2000 a plate?
What is this?
A Republican fundraiser?
Look, these plates are collector's items.
I'm only doing this because you've said you're in a jam.
Sir, we have $1700 cash.
That's it.
I'll take it.
Give him the money, Sophia.
But my TV.
How about a hundred dollars and we'll show you a good time?
Give him the money.
Nice doing business with you.
Hello, everybody.
Hello there.
Who was that?
Gasman.
Oh.
Oh, it's so good to see you both home.
We took good care of your plate, Blanche.
Oh, thanks.
You know, I became a new person on this trip.
I realized that we have so little time while we're here together, we must cherish each and every moment.
Now, this plate represents the old me.
I feel wonderful.
I could go for some cheesecake.
What is this?
Sarcasm?
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend"  Hey!
Rose, for the past half-hour, you've been humming "Jingle Bells" and yelling "Hey"!
Now, why must you do that?
Because it's too hard to hum the "Hey"!
Oh, boy, it is hell out there.
Oh, it must be at least 103, and the mall was impossible.
Did you get something for the grandchildren?
Oh, please.
You know, Robbie wants a Batman hat.
I went to six different stores.
They were all sold out.
I finally went to one store where they had one hat left, and another woman saw it.
Oh!
I cannot believe a person would push a perfect stranger out of the way, step on her hand, and give her an elbow to the forehead just for a Batman hat - but I did it anyway.
I got the hat.
No, I guess I just have this thing about giving gifts that are more fun than the ones my grandparents used to give me.
Ma, do you remember that Christmas they gave me soap in the shape of the Seven Dwarfs?
Well, now what's wrong with that?
What kid wants to play with soap?
Besides, after a couple of baths, they looked like seven suppositories.
Hi.
It's me, Stan.
I brought you a gift.
Oh, why, thank you, Stanley.
Oh, and look, there's a little card.
"Merry Christmas, Sports Illustrated subscriber".
You don't have a baseball radio, do you, Dorothy?
Stanley, why are you really here?
I am going to make all you women wealthy.
How come whenever my ship comes in, it's leaking?
I am planning on opening a research and development lab.
We can come up with new and exciting novelties that will make today's plastic vomit obsolete.
To make all of this happen, all I need from each of you is $1,000.
What do you say?
No.
OK, make it 100, but no monthly report.
Goodbye, Stanley.
Why don't I just wait outside, give you a few minutes to think this over?
Fine.
Fine.
If he's still here in the morning, let's give him coffee, OK?
It's a nightmare.
We've been visited by the yutz of Christmas past.
I am drained of what little holiday spirit I had.
That's too bad, because we still have to shop for presents for each other.
Wait a minute.
Listen, I've been giving this a lot of thought.
None of us wants to go shopping in this terrible heat, so why don't we just put names into a hat, and then we just have to pick out a gift for the one person whose name we pick?
There's only one problem with your plan, pussycat.
One of us is gonna get the gift from Rose.
Dorothy, she's right.
And you know how hard it is pretending to like Rose's gifts.
Uh-uh.
Forget it.
No way.
Oh, come on, now, Blanche, don't be so childish.
We each stand an equal chance of having our Christmas ruined.
It's not going to bother me if I get Rose's gift.
Dorothy's right.
Be a good sport.
Rose, I have to tell you about Christmas.
It is too hot to shop, the stores are mobbed, and there are only two days left.
So we've decided to draw names out of a hat.
And that way, each of us only has to buy one gift.
But, Dorothy, I love shopping, and I love giving gifts.
And besides, if we draw names out of a hat, whose names are they gonna be anyway?
The Oak Ridge Boys', Rose.
Our names!
Oh!
Gee, I'm not sure about this.
I mean, when you think about Christmas, don't you think about giving gifts?
Yes, but that's not the first thing.
When I think of Christmas, I think of Christmas in New York.
The decorations in Macy's window, the show at Radio City, skaters on the ice at Mitsubishi Center.
In the old days on Christmas Eve we used to go to midnight Mass, remember, Dorothy?
Sure I do.
Oh, Ma, the music and the candles - it was beautiful.
And the Mass was in Latin, a fine old Italian language.
Now, who knows!
Sometimes it's in English, sometimes Spanish.
If you ask me, they should go back to Latin, the language Jesus spoke.
Ma, he spoke Hebrew.
Even in church?
You know, I've been thinking Oh, that would explain the beads of sweat.
Maybe Dorothy's right.
I guess I don't need a shopping spree to give me the Christmas spirit.
My church is serving Christmas dinner to the poor people in the neighborhood, and I've volunteered to go and help serve.
That'll do the trick for me.
OK, then let's do it.
Come on, now, look Remember, you only buy for the person whose name you pick.
And it doesn't matter who picks you, because it's bound to be a terrific gift.
Go ahead, Blanche.
OK.
OK, I buy for Dorothy.
Oh, yes!
Yes, yes, yes!
Oh, yes!
Oh Boy, Blanche, I didn't realize you were such a big spender.
Go ahead, Dorothy, you go.
OK, I buy for Ma.
Yes!
Ha ha!
This really was a good idea.
This is really fun.
Oh, shut up, Rose.
Is it my turn?
Yeah.
OK.
I buy for Rose.
Oh, thank you, God!
No, no, no, Rose, you can't pick yourself.
Oh, thank goodness.
I'm so hard to shop for.
Rose, you buy for Blanche.
OK, thanks, Dorothy.
This really was a good idea.
I don't wanna spoil the surprise, but in a couple of weeks someone in this room is gonna know how to yodel.
Your brother Phil, God rest his brain, gives the worst presents in the world.
What kind of gift is dental floss?
Well, it's waxed and mint-flavored.
Here, go floss yourself.
This stinks - after the swell gift I sent him?
What was it?
A catalogue item.
L.L. Bean?
Victoria's Secret.
Here it is, my present from Kirsten.
Oh, she always knows just what her mother wants.
Ha ha!
It's a St. Olaf snowball.
Rose, there's nothing in there but snow.
That's what St. Olaf looks like in winter.
Who's for some fresh-baked Christmas cookies?
Rose, why are the Christmas cookies in the shape of American flags and Liberty Bells?
I couldn't find a Christmas cookie-cutter, so I used the Fourth of July cookie-cutters instead.
I wonder where President Bush stands on eating the flag?
Well, that's all the presents - except for the ones we know are fruitcakes.
Wait a minute.
What about the present Blanche hid behind the couch?
Oh, my gift for you.
I'll get it.
I can't wait to see the look on your face.
Me too.
Here you go, sweetheart.
Why, Rose, it's a beautiful blouse!
I hope it's all right.
Dorothy said you'd like something crotchless.
Well, I'm due at church in about half an hour.
They're starting to serve Christmas dinner at one o'clock.
I better get ready.
Hey, Rose.
Rose, could you use some extra help?
We could use all the help we can get.
Then I'm going with you.
Hey, count me in.
Since I didn't get a gift I have to bury out in the backyard, I'm feeling all Christmassy too.
Ma, are you coming?
But I rented Scarface!
All right, I'll go too.
Hey, I got an idea.
We got all these fruitcakes from this Christmas, last Christmas and the Christmas before that.
Why don't we gather them all up and And what?
Build a bomb shelter?
No.
We can unload them.
I mean, bring 'em to the church for dessert.
Well, actually, I think that's very nice.
Like we say in St. Olaf, Christmas without fruitcake is like St. Sigmund's Day without the headless boy!
Well, before we open the doors, I just wanna thank you all for taking time away from your own Christmas to provide Christmas for some that are less fortunate.
We promise to turn away no one, remembering how Mary and Joseph were turned away at the inn.
Reverend Avery, it's always puzzled me - why didn't Mary and Joseph call ahead for reservations?
Surely they must have realized how impossible it is to get a hotel room during the Christmas season?
I guess that's one for the theologians, Rose.
I can never get used to serving turkey for Christmas dinner - it's so un-Sicilian.
What did you serve?
Eels.
Eels?
Yeah, it's true.
Eels are a traditional part of a Sicilian Christmas.
Of course, after Christmas, it's eel croquettes, eel hash, eel tetrazzini.
I sure miss a traditional St. Olaf Christmas.
Excuse me, Rose, do we have time to run out and get hit by a bus?
First there'd be the Christmas pageant, with the shepherds and the angels and the two wise men.
There were three wise men, Rose.
Not in St. Olaf.
Then we'd all go down to the town square and try to form a circle.
And then we'd all go home and smoke kippers.
Why, Rose?
Because it's the best way to get your house to smell like kippers.
And then in keeping with the spirit of Christmas, it was traditional to let all the animals sleep inside that night.
And then, the next morning, the rumors would start.
And they'd continue until New Year's, and we'd all make resolutions that it would never happen again.
But then, the next year, all it took was a little eggnog and one wise guy saying, "What the hell!
It's Christmas".
All right, volunteers, stand by.
I'm opening the doors.
Welcome.
Welcome, everybody.
Merry Christmas.
I just never thought there'd be children.
I know.
And what is Santa Claus doing here?
Oh, they pay these poor, out-of-work guys 10, 15 bucks to stand on street corners ringing their bells for charitable contributions.
A lot of 'em can't afford the price of a meal.
Hello there.
Hello, Santa Claus.
Dorothy it's me, Stanley.
Stan, what are you doing here?
What happened with the research and development deal?
Ah, that was just me trying to get some extra cash to tide me through the holidays.
You were gonna cheat us?
Oh, sure, if you wanna label everything.
Stan, how could you?
What did you want me to tell you, Dorothy, that I was broke, that I miscalculated the public taste?
I thought I was gonna go through the roof with my plastic reindeer poop.
That's what happens when you aim too high.
And then I figured, with the drought and the danger of fires, the one novelty item that would really take off this season is a little Santa wearing sunglasses, driving a fire engine.
So I put every last cent I had into that hunch, and I ordered 12 gross from my supplier in Germany.
Everything is getting out of East Berlin except my fire engines.
They didn't get here till last night.
Come on, Stanley, you've been down before.
This is the nature of your business.
Why don't you go home and enjoy Christmas, then face the future tomorrow?
I can't go home.
Why not?
Catherine threw me out.
Your wife threw you out?
I had no idea she was that bright.
What happened?
Catherine accused me of infidelity.
Oh, dammit!
Stan, this makes those infidelities during our marriage seem much less special.
Why did this have to happen to me?
Broke and homeless on Christmas - why me?
Why you?
Why them?
!
Look around you.
You're not exactly alone.
This is probably the only Christmas these kids are gonna have.
Think about that for a while.
It might take your mind off your own self-pity.
I've gotta go back to work.
Mrs. Sensitive.
You know, being here reminds me of my favorite Christmas back in 1951, which I spent at the USO, making a better Christmas for our boys getting ready to leave for Korea.
I gave those servicemen something even Mr. Bob Hope himself could not give them.
A rash?
Doughnuts, Dorothy.
Big Daddy was part-owner of a doughnut shop.
Did you really think this was going to be a story about sex?
This is a beautiful Christmas story, Dorothy.
Now, that really hurts me.
I'm sorry, Blanche.
Well, anyway, after the boys had their doughnuts Actually, at this point, it does change more into a Veterans Day story.
In fact, what happened to Dorothy's ex-husband is not that uncommon.
Really?
You'd be surprised how many people are only two or three paychecks away from being on the street.
The suddenly poor are all around us.
Once you've been knocked down like that, it's very hard to recover.
What's going to happen to all these people?
I don't know.
There's no affordable housing, the rents keep going up and up, and the minimum wage has been held down.
Seems so unfair.
Well, that's because it is.
There are three million homeless, hungry people in this country.
What bothers me is, those people out there are being fed today because it's Christmas, but what will they eat tomorrow?
When the great communicator talked about his vision of a city on a hill, I wonder if it included people sleeping on gratings in the street.
Dorothy, Stan's out there feeling so sorry for himself, he's bringing down the homeless.
Blanche, will you take over for me?
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna go and try to make Stan feel like a whole man again.
Anything you need?
Yes, half a man.
Sophia, you were just putting me on about those eels, right?
Please!
In Sicily, it wouldn't be Christmas without a plate of eels.
Eels and larks.
Larks?
Honey, larks aren't eating birds, they're singing birds.
They don't sing long in Sicily.
Stanley.
Yeah?
I forgot to wish you a merry Christmas.
Some Christmas.
Oh, come on, Stanley, you're the most fortunate person here.
Big deal!
Stanley, you've always been able to turn bad holidays around.
Do you remember the Christmas we were so broke that you actually convinced the kids that Christmas was the 26th, and then you went out and got a Christmas tree from somebody's garbage?
You trimmed it with gum wrappers and pull tabs.
And then you turned on the television, and they were playing Jim Thorpe - All American, and you told the kids it was King of Kings.
And they believed it, too.
Right up to the part where Jesus had his Olympic medals taken away for playing professional baseball.
That became sort of a tradition with us.
Yeah.
You had ingenuity then.
You didn't let anything beat you.
And you can do it again, Stan, if you just work hard and turn on that Zbornak charm.
I am pretty good at that.
Oh, you could charm the pants off anybody.
I have to believe that - otherwise, I was easy.
But, Dorothy, it's different this time.
Sure, sure, I've scraped the bottom of the barrel before, but this time I don't even have a barrel!
Oh, Stan, will you stop whining?
It's pathetic.
That's the most effective way to whine.
All I need is a few bucks, just a little seed money.
OK, OK.
Here, here.
Stan, take it.
Attagirl.
To show you how much I love you, I'm not even going to count it.
I hate you, Stanley.
You are the lowest.
I'm sorry, Dorothy, if I am no longer the man you divorced.
So am I. I'd love to stick around and be belittled Fine, fine.
You've eaten.
Go somewhere else and wallow.
You better be careful.
You're not the only ex-wife I have.
Then why do you keep bothering me?
You're the only one who answers the door.
Well, I guess that about does it.
All the food is gone.
Except the fruitcake.
I don't get it.
There's more now than when we started.
I just wish there was something more we could do for these people.
Especially the children.
Yes, I know.
I'm supposed to look after their spiritual needs, but even I can't help thinking they have other needs that are far more pressing.
Well, I'd like to thank you all very much for coming.
I wish you every blessing for the New Year.
Merry Christmas!
Ho-ho-ho!
Here's Santa, with toys for all the good boys and girls.
Ho-ho-ho!
Have you all been good boys and girls?
Yeah!
Ah!
Ho-ho-ho!
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!
Oh, my gosh.
I'm proud of you, Stan.
Really proud.
That was a lovely thing you did.
You made me believe in Santa Claus again.
Me, too.
Not me - I knew it was Stan all along.
After I walked outta here this afternoon, I realized that I'm more fortunate than a lot of people.
Tomorrow I'm gonna get the jump on the Easter season.
I have a new idea for a great novelty.
It's a decorated Easter egg with a window in it.
When you look into it, you see a beautiful Easter scene.
That's not a new idea.
Those Easter eggs have been around for years and years.
Yes, but this one leaves a black circle around your eyes.
That practically screams Easter!
And, you know, Dorothy, I apologized to my wife, and in the spirit of Christmas, she's letting me come back home.
Great.
In that case, you can give me back the $60 I gave you.
Well, when I apologized, I said it with flowers.
Dorothy, I may be a lot of things, but I'm not cheap.
You know, actually, this is one of the best Christmases I ever spent with Stan.
It was pretty nice.
I can't remember feeling this proud of myself so early in the evening.
No, we did good.
I just wish we could do more.
Oh, so do I. I mean, we have a place to go home to, and so many people don't.
We should keep them in our hearts and our minds - not just on Christmas, but every day of the year.
It's more than a place to go.
It's having someone there for you.
We have each other.
There's always someone there.
That's right.
That's right, darling.
So let's go home.
Thanks, girls, for coming down and helping out.
It was wonderful.
Oh, thank you for having us.
I'm glad you asked.
And, hey, merry Christmas.
Oh  Merry Christmas.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Dorothy.
Oh, hi, Ma.
Listen to this.
"If I were truly free, O fire of my loins" "I'd take you to a paradise in the sun where we could lie naked, "bronzed body against pearl body, locked together in a frenzy of love".
Ma, who wrote that?
!
Merrill Kellogg.
Merrill Who's he?
Ask Blanche.
It's her letter.
This is from that guy in prison that Blanche has been writing to.
How are you gonna explain this opened letter to Blanche?
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.
Morning, girls.
Good morning, Blanche.
Rose opened your letter.
Blanche, I didn't.
It's no problem, honey.
It's just another one of those letters from Merrill.
I would read it to you anyway - they're not personal.
Not personal?
The man said he wants to lie naked with you on a beach.
Sure.
And I wrote him I want to make passionate love to him in a hammock suspended between two magnolia trees - you know that couldn't possibly happen.
Well, maybe if you lose a few pounds Shut up, Rose.
These letters are just a fantasy.
The man is in prison for the next 20 years for armed robbery.
Blanche, I don't think it's right to lead the guy on like that.
Why not?
The poor man is surrounded by concrete and bars.
What's wrong with bringing a little joy into his life?
Nothing at all.
Back in St. Olaf, our justice system is very progressive.
Their motto was, "Use a gun, go apologize".
I'll get it.
Mary, honey!
Hi, Dorothy.
Hey, welcome, stranger.
Come in here and sit down.
So how've you been doing?
Tell me, sweetheart, you having fun in high school?
It's OK.
Oh, I loved high school.
It seems like only yesterday - riding around with the boys in their cars, and the dances Don't forget the Hindenburg disaster.
Ma, look who's here.
Oh!
So, Mary, when's the baby due?
Ma, you're talking to a 16-year-old girl.
A knocked-up Ma, how did you know?
Because you had the same look of panic on your face when you got pregnant.
Kind of like a deer caught in the headlights of a car.
I thought only pregnant teenagers had that expression, until I saw Dan Quayle on TV.
I can't believe it.
It was only yesterday you were selling us cookies.
Now she's giving them away.
Mary, honey, have you told your father?
I tried, but since Mom died, I don't know, we're just on different wavelengths.
Well, honey, what about the baby's father?
After all, it's his responsibility, too.
We broke up.
And besides, he's away at college now.
What are you gonna do?
I don't know.
My father kicked me out.
I got so many things I gotta figure out.
I guess I gotta get a job and a place to stay.
Oh, Mary, look, you have too many things to figure out.
Why don't you stay here with us, until we can all decide what to do?
Absolutely.
Really?
Yes, we'll take care of you.
I don't know how to thank you.
Now, you come into the kitchen with me, honey.
I'll get you some pickles and ice cream.
Oh, no, thanks.
I don't have any strange cravings yet.
Strange?
I cannot believe her father could be so mean.
Not half as mean as his dog Samson.
Did I ever tell you what that dog did to my friend Ida Silverman?
No.
What?
He ate her.
Gobbled her up without a trace, support hose and all.
Ma, Ida's daughter told me she moved to Fort Lauderdale.
The woman's in denial.
I saw that dog with Ida's blue scarf in his mouth, and no one has seen her since.
Ma, what does Fred's dog have to do with this?
It's a known fact that dogs take on the personality traits of their masters.
That's ridiculous.
Oh, yeah?
Then why does your brother Phil's poodle like to wear that tutu and hop around on his hind legs?
Oh, come on, Ma.
I mean, Phil would look pretty stupid doing that by himself.
Rose.
Oh, Rose!
Blanche, what's wrong?
I never finished reading this letter from Merrill till just now.
Read that last paragraph.
"My sentence has been overturned on a technicality.
"I'm getting out on the 21st.
Now, finally, we can make all our dreams come true".
Isn't that terrible?
He's written catchier stuff, but I wouldn't call it terrible.
I'm not asking for a literary critique, you dweeb!
Merrill gets out on the But isn't that great news?
You can finally meet him.
I don't want to meet him!
I don't want him coming here - the man's a convict.
Oh, so Blanche's pen pal is getting out.
Gee, that's gonna be rough.
I bet after ten years in the jug, he's gonna be pretty short on foreplay.
Come in.
Hi.
Hi.
I brought you an extra blanket.
Thank you.
Seems like old times, huh?
I love this house.
I love this room.
I just feel so safe here.
After I'd visit Mom in the hospital, I always was so glad to come back here.
Now here I am again.
Only, this time I'm pregnant.
It's funny, huh?
What's that, honey?
It's just that I have another human being inside of me, and I've never felt more alone.
Mary, that's why you have to talk to your father.
No way.
Listen, this is the most difficult thing for a father to accept.
What, that I'm a grown woman?
But you're not a grown woman.
Just because the plumbing's in doesn't mean the house is ready to occupy.
I think I know what you're getting at.
Good, because I really didn't make that up myself.
I heard it on This Old House.
Well, I tried talking to my father, but he just went all crazy when I told him.
That's what fathers do - they yell and they barbecue.
That's what separates them from the apes.
What did your father do when he found out you were pregnant?
He chased Stan for three blocks with a salami.
How come?
They don't leave marks.
When he finally cooled down, he realized that he loved me more than anything in the world - which was lucky for me, because I never needed him more than I did then.
I don't think that's gonna happen with my dad.
Oh, you never know.
Fathers can surprise you sometimes.
Dorothy?
You remember when Mom was sick, you used to stay with me until I fell asleep?
And I used to hold your hand Ma, what are you doing?
Merrill called.
He's coming over.
I'm hiding all our valuables.
Why?
Why?
You think the man went to prison for free coveralls and some male bonding?
Quick, give me a hand with the TV.
Oh, Ma!
I cannot believe that Merrill is a dangerous criminal.
I mean, you've read his letters.
They're beautiful.
They're poetic, almost lyrical.
You can be sure he's a real gentleman.
I want Blanche.
Break out the finger sandwiches.
Mr. Astaire looks like he's hungry.
I'm Merrill.
Are you Blanche?
No.
How about you, cutie?
Boy, this guy's done hard time!
No, Blanche isn't here, and she won't be back for a long, long time.
That's all right.
I've been in prison ten years.
I'm real good at waiting.
Uh Can I get you something, Merrill?
No.
Uh, those were lovely letters that you wrote to Blanche, Merrill.
No, I didn't write 'em.
Walter, the guy in the next cell, did.
Wrote 'em to Harley, the night guard.
He's hoping to round himself up a date for movie night.
I just copied the letters and changed "Dearest Harley" to "Dearest Blanche".
Well, you did make a small contribution, Merrill.
Call me Moose - that's my nickname.
What a coincidence!
That was Dorothy's nickname in elementary school.
Remember, Dorothy?
No, I don't.
Look, Moose  What?
We don't know where Blanche is.
That's right.
She could be gone for hours.
Days.
I mean, it could be weeks before she gets back.
We're back!
Oh, we found some terrific bargains.
Mary, why don't you go try something on and show Dorothy and Sophia.
Well!
Dorothy, you didn't tell me you were expecting company.
This is Merrill.
Oh.
Well, how are you, Merrill?
Merrill!
Actually, he's more a friend of Blanche's.
We were just explaining to Merrill that there's no telling when Blanche will be back.
Oh, Lord, no.
There's no use waiting around.
You wouldn't like Blanche anyway.
She's not your type.
That's right.
She isn't.
She's very cold.
Frigid.
Hardly likes men at all.
And she's ugly.
Isn't she?
"Ugly" is a pretty strong word, Rose.
And wrinkled.
Isn't she?
She is not wrinkled.
And fat.
Stop that!
You just stop that right now.
She is none of those things, Rose Nylund.
She is gorgeous.
Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous!
All right, all right.
Sounds good.
Tell Blanche I'll be back.
And stupid.
Stupid, stupid, stupid!
Well, I'm off.
I'll be checking in for messages.
Take care of the house for me.
Where are you gonna go?
I'll be staying with my friend Janet.
She said I could spend the night there anytime.
Or was it her husband Ed who said that?
I just had a thought.
Congratulations.
Way to go.
Maybe we should sign Mary up for some natural childbirth classes.
That's not a bad idea.
I wish I'd known about them when I was pregnant.
I didn't know what to do, except scream at Stan never to touch me again and call him every name in the book.
Rough labor?
Rough conception.
Oh, she doesn't need those classes.
I think women ought to have babies the way God intended - strapped to a table, numb from the neck down.
Let me ask a question.
So, how much responsibility are we taking on ourselves here?
Oh, Ma, what are you talking about?
We can't just abandon her.
The girl needs a roof over her head, guidance, emotional support.
It's not up to us.
It's up to her father.
Oh, I tried talking to him.
He won't answer his phone calls or the messages that I leave in his mailbox.
First he lets his dog eat Ida, now this.
I'm mad as hell!
Let's go over there.
No, Ma, Ma, I don't think you should go.
This is a very sensitive situation, and it's gonna take a little patience and understanding.
That's perfect.
All I have is a little patience and understanding.
All right, all right.
But when we get there, remember we are trying to make peace.
So whatever you do, don't bring up Ida.
I won't - as long as the dog doesn't.
Hello, Fred.
Hello, Dorothy.
Mrs. Petrillo.
Why haven't you returned my calls?
There's nothing to talk about.
We're not going away, Fred.
All right, come in.
Have a seat.
Uh excuse me.
Has he eaten?
Don't worry.
He won't hurt you.
Fred, I think I know how you feel about Mary.
No, you don't.
You feel, because Mary went out and got herself pregnant, she's a slut.
Well, let me tell you what a slut is.
It's someone who gets knocked up in the back seat of a Studebaker at a drive-in movie.
It was a Studebaker, wasn't it, Dorothy?
It was a Nash, Ma.
Now, that's a slut.
Doggy, I don't know if you noticed, I'm all skin and bones.
Oh, I shouldn't say "bones".
Now where was I?
You were humiliating me.
Yeah, right, the slut.
And after all she did to me, did I turn her out?
You tried, Ma.
But did she go?
No.
And look at us today.
No one could love a daughter more.
Thanks, Ma.
So what if I don't respect her.
You've got a lot of nerve coming in here telling me how to raise my daughter.
You have no idea what I'm going through.
I gotta get outta here.
Don't worry about the dog.
He's just playing.
Yeah, right.
What did you do with Ida?
Samson.
Fred, what Ma was trying to say is that you can't just throw Mary out.
I didn't throw her out.
She walked out.
That's not how Mary tells it.
We got into a fight.
Who remembers who said what?
That's not the point.
Fred, I remember how scared I felt when I found out I was pregnant.
And you know what my biggest fear was?
That my father would hate me.
Oh, God, was he angry - and was I scared.
It was a long time before he'd accept the situation, and, Fred, until he did, I only had one parent.
Right now, Mary doesn't have any parents.
You talk like I did something wrong.
What can I say that'll make you understand?
I don't know.
Maybe I'm too stupid.
Fine, then maybe there is something I can say.
And I want to apologize for this story before I begin.
Have you ever heard of a little town called St. Olaf?
No.
Perfect.
Now, as it was told to me - and I have to admit that I wasn't listening that closely - there was this farmer named Nils Nibelung, and he had a pig named Brunhilde, and she won all the blue ribbons at all the county fairs.
Well, Nils also had a daughter named Fricka, and she won red ribbons - usually as runner-up to the pig.
Does this story have a point?
You asked that at just the right time.
Anyway, one April, Nils decided to breed Brunhilde - that's the pig, not the daughter - and he chose April because that's when pigs are at their most beautiful and desirable.
Unfortunately, so was Fricka.
So while Brunhilde and the pig were doing their thing, Fricka and the local pig breeder were doing theirs.
God, I hope I got the names right.
Anyway, when Nils heard about it, he banished Fricka from his house and his life forever.
So?
So after a while he lost interest in the pig's company and he ate her.
And he died St. Olaf's loneliest man.
Is that the end of the story?
God, I hope so.
I don't get it.
Fred, let me put it this way.
She is 16, she's scared, and she's carrying your grandchild.
Do you really want to abandon her?
Anybody home?
Oh, I thought you were gonna spend the night at Janet's.
On the way over there, I got to thinking, is there really any reason for me to be running away from Merrill?
I mean, the man has paid his debt to society, hasn't he?
After all, is there any man on earth I can't handle?
Well, I got nowhere with Fred.
And Ma was no help - there is no way to control her mouth.
Oh, my God!
What happened?
What's the matter?
Who did this to you?
The Sandinistas.
Why would they do this?
Because I knew too much.
Merrill did this about an hour ago.
Merrill?
Ma, are you all right?
What did Merrill do?
He came looking for Blanche.
I held out as long as I could.
Oh, my God!
How did he make you talk?
I think it was the white wine.
I finally told him she was Blanche and she didn't want anything to do with him.
What did he say?
He said he wanted to have something to remember you by.
So he took the silver.
Oh!
At least it's some consolation that he couldn't possibly find the secret place where I hide my jewelry.
Oh.
Did I mention there was wine and music?
I'll get it.
Hello?
Merrill!
My God!
Where are you?
Jail?
Well, they only allow you one phone call, and you called me?
What?
I'm wearing a green silk pant suit.
Underneath?
Well Oh, give me that!
Fred!
Hi, I thought I'd stop by since I was in the neighborhood.
Fred, you live in the neighborhood.
Right, Well, I wanted to come by and see Mary.
Hi, Daddy.
How're you doing?
I'm doing OK.
Good.
Look, Mary, I've been talking to Dorothy, and she really made sense.
It doesn't matter who's right or wrong.
Why don't you just come home and we'll work it out?
Sounds good.
Thank you, guys, for everything.
Don't you be a stranger now.
Don't worry.
I'll come back tomorrow and get the rest of my stuff.
Let us know how you're doing.
Don't forget, Tuesday we have mime class.
Mime class?
The Lamaze class was all filled up.
Well, we'll see you soon.
And, Dorothy, thanks for all your help.
Maybe we can get together soon and you can tell me all about that St. Olaf.
Sounds like a good place to raise a daughter.
I was desperate!
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Oh, Dorothy, by any chance, did you borrow my pearl-handled six-shooter?
Blanche, you look ridiculous.
Well, I do not.
I'm a cowgirl.
Yippee-aye-oh K-Y.
Ki-yay.
Oh, well, whatever.
Have you seen my gun?
No.
Damn!
Why wear this if I've got nothing to put in it?
I say the same thing every morning when I put on my bra.
Blanche, why are you dressed like that?
Because I am going to an authentic Texas-style barbecue, and my date is a real-life cowboy.
Morty Fishbein is a real-life cowboy?
He's from Amarillo, Texas.
He was the grand marshal of the B'nai B'rith rodeo for three years straight.
Who better to go with to a barbecue?
Hello.
Morty.
Threw your back out putting your boots on?
You're in traction?
Oh, I guess this means you're gonna be a little late?
Oh, all right.
Well, can you believe that?
Because of one little slipped disc, Morty is not taking me to the barbecue.
What a shame.
You'll miss the foot-stomping version of "Sunrise, Sunset".
You know, this kind of thing has been happening to me a lot lately.
I think it's because I'm going out with men who are too old for me.
In the last year my average date has been over 60, bald, covered in liver spots and wears a truss.
Sounds good to me.
I used to attract men who were young and active and virile, but now they just want to date girls in their 20s and 30s.
What's a great-looking gal in her 40s to do?
Perhaps we should find one and ask her.
Oh, come on, Blanche.
This is all your own fault.
I mean, take Steven.
You'd been dating him for six weeks.
The moment it looked like you were making a commitment, you dumped him.
It's like six weeks is your cutoff point.
It is not.
It is too.
You were getting along great, you liked each other, you had a wonderful time together.
I don't want to talk about it.
Besides, Steven didn't have all the qualities I look for in a man.
Hi, girls.
What a great day.
I feel so terrific.
It's like life is a giant weenie roast and I'm the biggest weenie.
No argument from this corner.
Rose, you're even more relentlessly cheerful than usual.
Thank you.
It's because I've joined this group.
They teach you positive thinking to bring health, success and love into your life.
There's a meeting tonight.
Wanna come?
Oh, Rose, come on.
Forget it.
This is just a fad.
This is for gullible people who believe in magic.
Dorothy, you're not very open-minded.
I am so.
Now shut up.
That's exactly what I'm talking about.
You should listen to yourself sometime.
What are you afraid of?
I'm not afraid of anything.
Why don't you come to the meeting?
Maybe you'll find something to make your life better.
Oh, all right.
Rose, if it'll make you happy, I'll go.
Rose, me too.
You won't regret it.
How about you, Sophia?
Remember, today is the first day of the rest of your life.
Terrific.
If I'm lucky, I may live to be seven.
Oh, girls.
You're just in time.
Where's Blanche?
She said to save her a seat.
She saw a man smiling at her out in the hall.
Everybody's smiling here.
I haven't seen so many goofy smiles since the great denture swap at Shady Pines.
Welcome to Create Your Own Miracles.
My name is Mary Ellen.
Hi, Mary Ellen.
You're special.
You're special too, and do you know why?
Because you're you, and there is nobody else like you in the whole world.
Do you understand that?
Only an idiot wouldn't understand that.
Mary Ellen, I'm completely lost.
Could you run that by me again?
After the lecture, Rose.
Just like last week.
Now, are there any newcomers here tonight?
Right over here.
Rose, no.
Oh, please, stand up and introduce yourself.
I'm Dorothy Zbornak.
I'm Melanie Griffith.
Hi, Dorothy.
Hi, Melanie.
You're special.
You're nuts.
Actually, we're not newcomers.
We're just observing.
You must have a fear of committing.
She had no problem committing me.
Look, joining a group, particularly a group like this, just isn't my thing.
I see.
So, your thing is sitting on the sidelines and playing the cynic, bursting a child's balloon so he'll learn about the harshness of life early, pointing out what's wrong with the world rather than what's right about it.
That sounds good.
Where can we sign up for that group?
Dorothy, you're a very negative person.
People are given these messages very early in life, usually by their parents.
In your case, my guess is the mother.
Guess again, oh, special one.
Is it my fault she got knocked up at 19, married a loser Look, to me, this is all a big show.
I am sure that under all these smiles, you people have to be aware that life can be pretty miserable sometimes.
Come on, Melanie.
I am sorry you feel that way, but at least be open enough to hear what we have to say.
Fine.
I think everybody really likes you, Dorothy.
Everyone is beautiful on the inside I cannot believe this.
I have a great guy like Steven just crazy about me, and I'm wasting my time here with these grinning idiots.
Let's go home.
We said we'd stay till after the meeting.
Just a word of caution - don't doze off.
I think that's when the pods take over your body.
Ma, I hate to admit it, but there may be something to Rose's positive-thinking course.
Last night I decided to write down all the negative thoughts that come into my head, and Ma, I cannot believe how many there are.
I mean, just listen to this, right here on page 187: "The faucet is dripping.
"I know it's gonna keep me up all night.
"Then I'll be tired for my crummy job tomorrow.
Life is a swirling eddy of despair".
I mean, I can't believe that something as insignificant as a leaky faucet could bring all these bad thoughts about myself.
It's a very serious thing, Dorothy.
Ma, what can I do about it?
Try changing the washer.
Ma, I'm talking about my negative thinking.
I know what you're talking about.
Remember what your cousin Frederico used to say: "People waste their time pondering whether a glass is half empty or half full.
Me, I just drink whatever's in the glass".
Ma, Cousin Frederico was a hopeless alcoholic who played boccie ball with an imaginary friend named Little Luigi.
Kind of puts that dripping faucet in perspective, doesn't it?
Hi.
Hi, Sophia.
Steven, nice to see you again.
Dorothy, it's nice to see you.
Do you mind if I get a drink?
I must have sweat off ten pounds today.
You played a lot of tennis?
Tennis, yeah.
Yeah, right.
Just help yourself to whatever's in the fridge.
It's nice that you two have worked out your differences.
I think the problem with him before was that he was on the rebound from Karen, but now that he's gotten over her, he's all mine, and I think we appreciate each other more.
Everything old and familiar has become new and exciting.
That's nice.
Maybe I should look up one of my old flames.
Yeah, but not Stan.
The other one.
I have some incredible news!
You've been traded to the Rams?
Do you know that nasty butcher down at the deli?
The little guy with four fingers?
That's him.
I don't know, but every time I order roast beef, he cheats me.
I don't know how he does it.
I stand and watch as he slices a big, juicy roast beef, but when I get home, I find these crummy, little, hard pieces, you know, from the end?
Anyway, today I went in with a positive attitude.
I told myself, "This man is my friend and I know he is going to give me a good cut of meat".
Look.
It's a miracle!
Oh, great.
Pilgrims are gonna be showing up to kiss Dorothy's luncheon meat.
Ma, I know it doesn't mean much to you, but I acted positively and things are improving in my life.
I don't know, now I feel that I have the power to make anything happen.
Boy, is it beautiful out there today.
Thank you.
Dorothy, do you think I'm dressed OK for the dog races?
That depends.
Are you competing?
Sophia, nothing you can say is gonna bother me, and you know why?
'Cause when I'm with Steven, I don't know, I get goose bumps, I feel all tingly.
Oh, I understand what you're talking about.
I feel the same way when I hear the words, "And filling in for Doc, Tommy Newsom".
This is terrific!
Terrific!
Blanche took a positive step and positive things are happening in her life.
Maybe it'll work for me.
You know what I'll try to get?
A man who is open, caring, honest, who has eyes only for me.
Pussycat, you got your roast beef.
Don't push it.
That was the hospital.
Steven's had a heart attack.
You want me to drive you to the hospital?
No.
I'm not sure that it's a good idea for you to drive yourself.
I'm not sure that I'm gonna go.
What do you mean, you're not sure you're going?
Oh, I just have some other things I have to do.
If something bad happened to somebody I care about, I'd be over in a shot.
Well, I do care about him.
I just have some things I have to do.
Like what?
Look.
I'm trying to keep this relationship casual.
If I go to that hospital, I'm in and there's no getting out.
Don't be silly.
All you do is follow the orange line down the middle of the hallways.
They lead right to the elevators.
I mean, I don't think it's a good idea to hook up with a 60-year-old man with a bad heart.
What guarantee do I have we'll have any kind of future together?
Blanche, in life there are no guarantees.
There are choices.
Well, then, my choice is either to play it safe or to take a risk.
I wish I knew what to do.
All right, all right.
I can pick up a cue.
Picture it.
Sicily, 1912.
A beautiful, young peasant girl with clear, olive skin meets an exciting but penniless Spanish artist.
There's an instant attraction.
They laugh, they sing.
They slam down a few boilermakers.
Shortly afterwards, he's arrested for showing her how he can hold his palette without using his hands.
But I digress.
He paints her portrait and they make passionate love.
She spends much of the next day in the shower with a loofah sponge, scrubbing his fingerprints off her body.
She sees the portrait and is insulted.
It looks nothing like her.
And she storms out of his life forever.
That peasant girl was me and that painter was Pablo Picasso.
Ma, I have a feeling you're lying.
Be positive, Dorothy.
OK, I'm positive you're lying.
It doesn't make any difference, Dorothy.
I know what I have to do.
In this case, I'm gonna put me first.
Ooh, now, there's a radical shift in priorities.
Look, I just don't feel like making this kind of emotional investment.
Blanche You don't understand.
I lost one man I loved when George died.
I just won't do it again.
Hi, Rose.
Hi, Dorothy.
How was your day?
Rose, I tried to be positive, but it was lousy.
Dorothy, in times like these, you have to hold onto your faith, just like Hans Gluckenflunken, St. Olaf's greatest explorer.
Rose, please, let me have a little recovery time before you start a St. Olaf story.
You see, Hans Gluckenflunken set out for Florida to find the Fountain of Intelligence.
Unfortunately, when he got to Duluth, he took a left instead of a right and he wound up back in St. Olaf.
That's how he got his nickname, Wrong Way Gluckenflunken.
Rose, how is this a story about faith?
Well, when he got back, it was the dead of winter.
Tired and hungry and but still clinging to his belief that he would find the Fountain of Intelligence, he saw the miracle water trickling out of the ground, and he fell to his knees and tasted it.
Unfortunately, it was a broken sewer main.
Two days later, he died of cholera.
What is the point, Rose?
He was positive he had found the Fountain of Intelligence.
In fact, his dying words were, "I think I've learned something from this".
Girls Am I interrupting?
I sincerely hope so.
I thought you had a date.
Oh, I cancelled.
He was just a nice man with a big boat who wanted to go to Bimini.
That sounds like hell.
I don't know, I'm just not ready to start up something with someone new.
I think it's because you miss Steven.
Uh-huh, a lot.
Why don't you go to the hospital?
Because when he got sick it scared the hell out of me.
And you did what you always do - you ran.
Blanche, it's time to stop running.
You really think so?
Absolutely.
You're right.
I will.
Oh, Dorothy, you always give me the best advice about men.
Who says wisdom comes from experience?
Oh, my God, what's happened?
Is he all right?
He'll be OK.
I just hate seeing him like this.
Oh.
Are you a relative?
I'm his wife.
His wife?
He told me his wife died years ago.
Oh!
Oh, he did, did he?
You louse!
You crumb!
This is who you're cheating with now?
A woman in her 60s?
We're through.
You'll be hearing from my attorney.
He's all yours.
Enjoy.
You're not Steven!
I'm over here, Blanche.
Oh!
Sorry about that.
Hi!
Hi, Blanche.
How are you?
Oh, never mind me.
How about you?
Coming along.
The doctor told me to keep my life nice and dull.
No more excitement for a while.
By the way, thanks for the flowers.
It was the least I could do.
I thought so too.
Oh, Steven, I'm sorry.
There's no excuse for my not being here, but the important thing is I'm back.
Blanche Wait, honey, let me finish.
I know how much we care for each other, I know how good we are for each other, and, let's face it, nobody has more fun with each other than we do.
You remember that night on the beach, when I pretended my hand was a big old sand crab crawling up your thigh?
We wrapped ourselves up in that blanket, and you about jumped out of your skin when I showed you that Savannah twister.
You remember that?
Are you all right, Mr. Gordon?
Yes, I'm fine.
Sorry.
It won't happen again.
At least not until you're out of here.
Blanche Karen and I are back together.
Karen?
Well, I thought you said it was all over between you two.
I thought it was, but she came to the hospital as soon as she heard.
Oh.
So you're gonna let one little gesture of goodwill end our relationship?
Well, she was here when I needed someone the most.
And I realized how much we still mean to each other.
I'm very happy for you.
No, I'm not.
I'm mad at me.
Damn!
Ever since my husband died I think, "If I don't leave, I'm gonna get left".
It looks like either way, I end up alone.
I'm sorry.
Not half as sorry as I am.
Do I feel stupid.
You shouldn't.
You're a terrific lady.
I'm gonna miss you.
Don't you forget me, now.
Oh, don't worry.
I'll always have this printout to remember you by.
You want me to drive tonight, Dorothy?
Oh, Rose, listen.
I'm not going to the meeting tonight.
How come?
I'm not comfortable there.
I'm not comfortable with the people.
I'm not comfortable with the whole thing.
But you need the group's support, Dorothy.
It's not a good idea to go it alone.
Did I ever tell you about my cousin Vigdor Fricken?
He tried to go it alone in a three-legged race.
Well, you know what happened to him?
Please, Rose.
I don't want to hear about your frickin' cousin.
Well, fine.
Then if you're not gonna go, I'm gonna stay home too.
How come?
I've seen you at those meetings, Dorothy.
You tried to change, but you couldn't.
If I keep going there, I'm gonna drive you crazy.
Well, Rose, I don't want you to stop doing something you believe in.
I've gotten all I'm gonna get out of it.
Besides, I'd rather be part of this group than that one.
I hate to say this, but Rose, you're special.
Thank you, Dorothy.
I could never get them to say that to me at those meetings.
Oh, Blanche, is everything all right?
Steven's back with his old girlfriend.
Oh.
Are you OK?
Oh, yeah.
I'm fine.
I guess I learned a little bit about missed opportunities and how sometimes you have to take chances.
But all is not lost.
I met a new man in the next bed.
He's recently broken up with his wife, and the good news is he has the heart of a 25-year-old.
Hey, that's great.
Yeah.
As long as his body doesn't reject it.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Dorothy, do we know anybody named Cecilia?
Your cousin, Ma.
She only has weeks to live.
Oh!
Next time I'll accept the charges.
Hello?
No.
No, we don't have a car for sale.
You must have the wrong number.
Is it a man or a woman?
A woman, interested in a Mercedes Mm-hm.
Hello.
Sorry, the car's been sold.
Uh-huh.
Blanche, what is this all about?
I have figured out the most wonderful way to meet men.
Rich, eligible men.
I put an ad in the paper saying I have a Mercedes for sale for a very low price.
You don't have a Mercedes.
But I'm renting one and pretending it's for sale.
All day tomorrow, men are gonna be showing up here for a test drive.
You can tell a lot about a man by how he drives.
You know, that's true.
Sometimes Stan couldn't even get the key in the ignition.
Hi!
Hi, everybody.
Hi, Miles.
How was your evening?
It was terrific.
We saw a marvelous production of The Glass Menagerie.
That is one of my favorite plays.
Frankly, I was a little disappointed.
Really?
When you told me you were taking me to a revival of Tennessee Williams, I was expecting something more along the lines of a sÃ©ance.
Rose, I have never met anyone like you.
Check the cornfield on Hee Haw.
Ma, why don't we go, so that Rose and Miles can be alone?
Why?
We were here first.
Ma, isn't it time for your medication?
Oh, good.
I thought my buzz was wearing off.
I really did have a good time tonight.
And don't forget, I'm taking you out tomorrow for your birthday - my treat.
Oh, no!
Rose, I forgot to tell you.
My daughter Caroline is flying in for my birthday.
Maybe we could all go out to lunch.
I'm very anxious for you two to get together.
Why don't you two come here for lunch?
I'll cook something special.
That's a great idea.
I loved what you made the last time.
What was it called - gerkinflunken?
Oh, no, that was my uncle.
The owner of St. Olaf's most famous haberdashery.
He came up with the slogan, "You don't have to be Amish to look Amish".
Gosh, I wish I could afford something pretty like this for my potential car buyers, but I'm having those end-of-the-month money problems.
Looking for a loan?
You've come to the right place.
Why, Sophia!
How'd you get your hands on that kind of money?
I'm a graverobber.
What's it to you?
Morning, Blanche.
Morning, Ma.
Sleep well?
No.
I had that recurring nightmare - the one where I'm in bed with Warren Beatty and he says, "Sorry, this is too sick even for me".
Do we have the ingredients for kerflugenglugen?
Come on, Rose, get with it.
Do what the rest of us do - buy frozen kerflugenglugen.
Oh, I could never serve store-bought candied herring.
Besides, I have my own special recipe.
I use red-hots for the eyes.
Kill her!
Kill her now!
I'll get it.
Hello?
Well, you are aware that it's a two-seater?
It's not much of a family car.
Oh?
!
How long have you and your wife been practically separated?
Well, you might as well come over for a look.
How about, say, 12:20?
Oh, good.
Well, I can't wait for you to get your hands on it either!
Goodbye.
You're not having company?
I want everything to go smoothly for Miles and Caroline.
It's a big step, meeting a man's family.
Don't worry.
Men will be over, but they'll be in and out.
Don't say it, Ma.
I have to.
At my age, when you don't say it, it can back up on you and come out some other way.
My first appointment's here, right on time.
I've been out there watching him.
He's been looking at the car and smiling.
I feel just like a fisherman with a new lure.
You catch 'em, you clean 'em!
Blanche, aren't you embarrassed, going through all this subterfuge to get a man?
A man?
I'm planning on getting a six-month supply!
Oh, hi.
Blanche?
James.
I'm here about the car.
Miles?
No, honey, it's James.
You stay right there and I'll get the keys.
How much mileage has she got on her?
Let's just say she's been around the block.
Here we go, James.
Let's put the pedal to the metal.
I can't believe anything that beautiful is so cheap.
I'm cramping up!
Miles?
No, it wasn't Miles.
We'll let you know when he gets here.
Maybe we need a signal.
How about this - I yell, "Hey, Rose, Miles is here"?
Got it.
Miles?
Rose!
You might have forgotten the signal.
I know I did.
Hi.
Delivery for a Sophia Petrillo.
Here's a president you've never seen.
Look what I got, Dorothy - a surprise for you.
Oh!
Oh.
Oh, look at these watches!
They must have cost you a fortune.
They did.
Where'd you get the money?
Is that what you say to someone who bought you a gift?
Ma, I asked you a question.
I never told you this, Dorothy, but I'm a special friend of Phil Rizzuto.
Hi, ladies.
Hello, Miles.
I want you to meet my daughter Caroline.
Dorothy.
It's so nice to meet you.
This is Sophia.
Rose, Miles is here!
Rose, Miles is here!
Who?
Hello, Rose!
Miles?
Rose, this is Caroline.
Caroline, Rose Nylund.
How do you do?
I am so glad to finally meet you.
Lunch is all set up out on the lanai.
Your father says you're a classical musician.
What do you play?
The English horn.
I didn't know horns had nationalities.
But I guess it makes sense.
If jumping beans can be Mexican and fire drills can be Chinese and flies can be Spanish  Hi, I'm here about the car.
Come in.
Have a seat.
Thank you.
How're you doing?
Blanche is out on a test drive.
Blanche said I was gonna be the first.
She's been using that line for 40 years.
That was fun, James.
We ought to get together again sometime.
I'd like to talk to you about buying the car.
Not now.
I'll get backed up on my appointments.
Are you Thomas?
I am, here for my test drive.
You don't even have to show him the car.
I'll write you a check.
No, no.
At this price, I know I want the car.
Look, I'm writing out a $5,000 deposit now.
No, I can't do that.
The banks are closed.
I can't be sure it's any good.
You've got an honest face.
I'll cash that check right here.
Ma, can I see you in the kitchen?
I've got no secrets from these people.
Shady Pines, Ma.
Right behind you.
I think you should take my check Ma, I wanna know, where did you get the money?
The government has been kinder and gentler by sending me more social security checks than they used to.
The computer made a mistake.
Ma, that money doesn't belong to you.
How much are we talking about?
Enough to have you rubbed out if you rat on me.
Ma!
So far, 170 grand.
But I haven't checked today's mail.
It was awfully sweet of you to go to all this trouble, Rose.
This is, uh delicious.
Mm, even the eyes.
Have you tried those eyes?
Oh, no!
You ate the tail before we had a chance to make a wish.
Oh, I'm sorry, Rose.
I couldn't help myself - it was all so delicious.
You certainly know the way to a man's heart.
I'll just take these in.
I'll help you.
Who wants birthday cake?
What's in it?
It's a secret.
And in some countries, a vaccine.
Listen, I'll give you $20,000 and free root canal work.
You're a dentist!
I'll tell you what, I'll give you $25,000 and free root canal work.
You're a dentist, too!
No, but I really want this car.
Mail call!
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.
See ya.
These are all checks from the government?
No, there's also an application for a gold card.
Boy, word gets around fast!
I am so happy I finally got the chance to meet you.
I'm happy, too.
Rose I've a feeling you and I are gonna be the best of friends.
There's something we need to talk about.
It's about you and Daddy.
I know it seems like a crazy match - a college professor and a farmer's daughter - but somehow what we have together seems to work.
Rose, it's only been a year since my mother died.
Daddy's still very vulnerable at this point.
I can understand why he reached out for you - you're very warm and very giving.
But he needs time.
So, please, if you really care for my father, the best thing you can do is stay away from him.
Oh, my God, Rose!
Now I've got three excited men out there - and for the first time in my life it seems like too many.
Your 1:30 appointment just got here, and I think he's interested.
Not another one!
What am I gonna do?
Didn't you think this thing through?
Didn't you think they'd want to buy the car?
No!
I assumed once they saw me, they'd forget all about the car.
Well, I'd better do something to get their minds off that car.
Why don't I offer 'em some cake?
That's Miles' birthday cake.
He'll have other birthdays.
But not with me.
Why?
What's wrong?
Caroline told me to stay away from Miles 'cause it's only a year since his wife died.
Oh, Rose, that's terrible.
Well, don't give her any cake.
Rose, those are Caroline's feelings, not Miles' - otherwise, why would he be here?
I was trying so hard to impress her.
I remember when we had to impress a man's parents, not his children.
Boy, Mother Devereaux was dead set against me marrying George.
She wanted her little boy to marry a virgin.
Hm!
How did she know you weren't?
Maybe it was all those "Honk if you've had Blanche" bumper stickers.
Oh!
I wish I knew what to do.
I could settle that thing with Miles in one minute.
I can handle men one at a time.
Blanche, could you really do something?
Sure I could.
If Dorothy will take care of that mess out in the living room.
Now, just a minute.
I have my own problems.
I'm dealing with a mother who stole money from the government.
Come on!
It's not like I'm an elected official.
Turn her in, Dorothy.
But first, go out there and take care of those men.
I have to take care of my mother.
I can't take care of both Miles and the men.
Dorothy, please do this for Blanche.
For me.
Oh, all right.
I don't want my plan to go to waste.
I still intend to date James and Thomas, so let them down easy.
Frank and Eddie, flush 'em.
Oh, Rose, don't be so upset.
Have you seen the way Miles looks when you tell those St. Olaf stories?
He looks like he's listening.
There you go!
Excuse me.
Excuse me, did you happen to see a little old lady go by?
The one who said, "What are you staring at?
I can buy you and sell you"?
Went that way.
Ma?
Now, look, Ma, we have to talk about the money.
Don't worry, pussycat.
Your sister and brother don't have to know anything about this.
I want you to promise that you'll send this money back to the government.
They're not good with money - they can't handle it.
They spent $400 for a toilet seat!
You know, Ma, I'm really surprised at you.
When I was a little girl, you told me how much it meant to you when you came here to America for the first time.
Do you remember what you thought of when you first saw the Statue of Liberty holding up her torch of freedom?
I was amazed.
You see?
I was amazed that women in this country shaved under their arms.
Ma, you told me how much America meant to you, how wonderful America was, how nice it is to be in a country that doesn't care about soccer.
That money belongs to America.
Ma, you have America's money and you have to give it back.
Dorothy, please You taught me to love this country.
You were the first one to make me feel proud of being an American.
You were the first one who put an American flag in my hand.
Ma, why don't you take a moment and think what America has given you?
Besides this 170 grand?
All right.
All right, all right, I'll send it back.
All of it?
Yes, Ma, all of it.
OK, OK.
I just hope they want it back after an 83-year-old woman rolled around in it naked.
Well, how was lunch?
I don't know how the woman does it.
The herring was not only delicious, but it looked happy!
Well, Caroline.
Did you tell your daddy about your little talk with Rose?
Not yet.
What did I miss?
I think he has a right to know.
I, uh told Rose the truth, Daddy.
It's too soon for you to have a relationship.
You what?
!
Now wait.
Could I say something?
You think your daddy has become involved too soon after your poor mother's demise, but, honey, a year is more than respectable.
Why, I've had men call me when their wives were in intensive care.
Granted, these men were not pillars of the community.
Well, he is not ready.
Caroline!
Caroline, your mother and I were married for 43 years.
They were wonderful years.
I didn't think I'd find someone I'd care about again, but this happens when it happens - I've got a second chance.
I think it would be nice if you'd be happy for me.
How could he do this?
He has needs, honey.
All men have needs.
And there are women out there who will to stoop to any means to prey on those needs - including false advertising.
I know, 'cause I've met 'em.
You just thank your lucky stars Rose Nylund is not one of those women.
I never looked at it that way.
Besides, after you get to know Rose, why, you'll you'll Oh, why spoil the surprise?
Gentlemen, please!
You don't seem to understand what I'm trying to tell you - the car is not for sale!
Why not?
It's haunted.
Haunted?
What?
The car is haunted.
I should know, I rode in it.
You look OK.
I'm 27 years old.
We're not getting anywhere.
Blanche wants James and Thomas.
I'll try to save them.
You go over there with Frick and Frack and try to ditch 'em.
You want me to offend them?
Pretend they're family.
Look, everybody named after an apostle, come with me.
Excuse me, there was no Eddie.
Have you guys ever heard of Totally Hidden Video?
Underneath this gray wig is comedian Kaye Ballard.
Thanks for being on our show.
So that's the story.
The car is not available, but Blanche Devereaux is.
I can't believe that I've been hustled!
Boy, if I wasn't a teacher and accustomed to abuse, I'd leave too!
Really?
You know, I'm a teacher myself.
No kidding?
Say, um why don't you tell me about this automobile thing again?
Say tonight, over dinner?
Oh, now, Blanche Devereaux is a very charming, attractive woman.
She is.
Shall I pick you up around 7:30?
I feel terrible about this.
Let's say 8:00.
Here.
Take her someplace decent.
Look, Rose, I made it perfectly clear to Caroline how I feel about you.
Maybe Caroline is right.
Your wife died such a little while ago.
Maybe I am taking advantage of your vulnerability.
Rose, you're a smart woman.
Oh, you are vulnerable!
Of course I am.
I'm drawn to your beauty, your charm, your unique brand of wisdom.
What about Caroline?
Oh!
Caroline doesn't know everything.
You should see the cardigan she got me for my birthday.
She can't even pick out a sweater for me, much less a whole person.
I wish she felt better about us.
She's just gonna have to get used to us.
I'm staying around.
If you'll let me.
Oh, I'll let you.
Rose Not in the kitchen - you'll dry out the cheese!
See you tonight, Rose.
Goodbye, ladies.
Bye-bye, Miles.
You take care of her.
Blanche, I can't thank you enough.
You're welcome.
Let's get to the important stuff - who am I going out with tonight?
Well, uh James says he never wants to see you again.
And, uh the truth is, I'm going out with Thomas tonight.
You're not upset, are you, Blanche?
Well, no, I'm not upset.
It serves me right.
Hey, matter of fact, take the Mercedes.
Have a good time.
Blanche, that's awfully sweet of you.
You got this coming.
Hello.
I would like to report a stolen Mercedes.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Woe is me.
Woe, O, woe is me!
Problem, Blanche?
Yes.
It's my hair - it has split ends, it's dull and listless, it makes my face look Its age?
If you're gonna make fun of somebody, make fun of Rose.
I need the professional care of the most talented hairdresser in Miami - Robert.
Oh, he's brilliant.
Do you know he was the first one ever to use mousse?
I'd check my facts if I were you, Blanche.
Mr. Ingrid of St. Olaf has been using moose ever since I can remember.
Of course, it's his own professional secret which part of the moose he uses.
But it'll keep your hair in place in winds up to I just don't believe you, Rose!
Ask Conway Twitty.
The problem is, Robert charges $300, and it's just not in my budget this month.
Oh, that's the trouble with being beautiful - the maintenance will kill you.
I have an idea, Blanche.
How about moonlighting and making some extra money?
Another job?
Rose, I already work my fingers to the bone "Picasso on your left, snack bar downstairs".
It's a wonder I'm not an alcoholic.
What I meant was, how about working for me?
I'm swamped with this project for Enrique Mas, and there is money for an assistant.
Tell me more.
Well, we're compiling statistics on supplemental healthcare for seniors.
Some companies are preying on fear and then using loopholes to avoid paying claims.
For someone on fixed income, it's a matter of life and death.
By "Tell me more," I mean, "Does it pay $300"?
Well, I suppose that'd be OK.
But I can't believe, with something this important, that you are still so self-centered.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Count me in.
Dorothy, can you drive me to the mall Friday night?
They're giving free blood pressure tests, and some of the girls and I have a high-low bet.
Ma, honey, don't you remember?
Friday night we're planning on having dinner at Joe's Stone Crab.
Oh?
It's your wedding anniversary.
Oh, yeah, right.
Sounds nice.
Ma, you didn't forget, did you?
Oh, forgive me, I forgot something.
Maybe you should ship me back to Shady Pines.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll be in the living room being feeble.
If I can find the living room!
Dorothy, what just happened?
Well, weren't you listening?
Sophia came in and asked Dorothy to drive her to the mall for a blood pressure test.
And then Dorothy told Sophia that they had a date to go out to dinner Friday night, and then Sophia said Would you hand me the newspaper?
Oh.
No, the "Metro" section.
that she and the girls Hey, don't kill the messenger.
It's Ma.
She's becoming more forgetful.
And she denies it and she gets mad.
How bad is it?
Bad.
It's not just a matter of small things anymore.
I can't believe she forgot this dinner.
I mean, every year since my father died, I've been taking her out to dinner on her wedding anniversary, because she's lonely.
Maybe you'd better talk to her doctor about this.
You're right, Blanche.
I guess I've just been hoping that things would improve by themselves.
You know, I never thought Ma would lose her memory.
Of course, I never thought Alan Alda would get on my nerves.
Ma, can we talk for a minute?
I'm going through the family album.
I thought I'd pay your father a visit.
Look, here we all are!
Your sweet sixteen party, right?
Right!
Look at that beautiful chiffon dress.
Yeah, your brother Phil always did like to make a splash.
Ah, look!
The Jersey shore, summer 1939.
Pop sure loved playing with you kids.
Why do I look so upset?
Oh, Ma, don't you remember?
Pop was a big fan of Jean Harlow's back then.
You hated it when he made sand breasts in front of the children.
He was really some character.
Oh, look at us.
Oh, boy, your father sure looked stupid.
Stupid?
Ma, this was one of your favorite pictures.
Oh, Pop looks so proud.
The idiot's dressed like an organ grinder.
Yes.
Yes, he is.
Remember, we had no money, and he refused to go on assistance.
He vowed that he would take any job to feed his family.
And we had meat on the table every night.
I don't know he did it on 10 cents a day.
Where's the monkey?
Oh, look, there you are, stirring sauce.
Ah, my old kitchen.
Yeah.
And there are the potholders Grandma made, your pasta maker.
Ah, the pantry.
Remember what Pop kept behind the pantry door?
Yeah, he carved a giant heart there that said "Sal loves Sophia".
No, Ma, it was our height measurements.
He kept track of them on the back of the pantry door.
Dorothy, that was my kitchen, that was my Sal, and he put the heart there because he loved me.
That I remember!
I'm sure you do.
Listen, Ma why don't we talk to your doctor and see what he has to say, hmm?
Yeah, well maybe.
I don't remember half these photos.
I don't remember Brooklyn.
I don't even remember you going off to your senior prom.
Ma, I never went to my senior prom.
Actually, I did remember that, but why should I be the only one here to feel like crap?
Hi.
Blanche, I thought you were gonna be working.
You don't think playing three sets of tennis in this heat is work?
When are you gonna get the survey done?
Rose, let me explain something.
Now, in this world, there are two kinds of people.
One is an industrious, hardworking, give 100%, pain-in-the-butt-to- everybody-else go-getter.
I am not one of those people.
Gee, I wish I felt better about this.
Well, I wish you did, too.
Sophia, Dorothy, how did it go at the doctor's?
It was great.
He said that Ma's memory problem could be related to a nutritional imbalance, so he put her on a special diet, and if she follows it, she'll be fine from here on out.
Oh, lucky me, I can remember from now on.
My whole past is gone!
I could have slept with JFK and don't even know it!
Ma, I don't think so.
You're not mentioned in any of the books.
Well, that doesn't necessarily mean anything.
Ma, come on, now.
He also said that there are things that you can do that might bring back some of what you've lost.
I mean, we could talk about the good old days, reminisce with old friends.
Honey, you have to look on the bright side.
I've had a lifetime of bright sides.
I'll just have to learn to do without them.
Oh, dammit.
I hate watching what this is doing to her.
I hate watching what it's doing to you.
I hate watching those FBI warnings at the beginning of video rentals.
Oh, hello, sir.
I am conducting a phone survey regarding healthcare for the elderly.
May I ask your age?
That's not so old!
And what's your general health?
That's good.
What would you say is your annual income?
Oh, that's very good!
Marital status?
Oh, I am sorry.
How long?
Three weeks!
I'd say it was time you were getting on with your life, honey.
Thank you very much.
Blanche, marital status is not a question on the survey.
Well, I'm sorry, Rose, but I ask a man 20 questions, you can bet your life one of 'em's gonna be, "Are you married"?
I can't believe it!
Haven't you done anything?
Of course I have.
Do you see this big stack right here?
Well, just behind it is what I have done.
It's only one survey, but I'm very proud of it.
I should've known this was gonna happen.
You should never work with friends.
You're fired.
You can't fire me.
That's against the law - that's sex discrimination.
Oh.
Well, I'll give you one more chance.
Wait a minute!
How is it sex discrimination?
That's what I was doing this afternoon when I didn't get this work done.
How's Sophia?
I don't know.
Today's her anniversary.
She won't come out of her room.
I've never seen her like this.
She is really depressed.
Adios!
Everybody wave goodbye!
I'm off to Brooklyn!
Honey, what are you doing?
I'm going back to the old neighborhood.
The doctor said it would help if I stirred up some memories.
Ma, you can't go back there alone!
No kidding.
I'm 83.
I walk to the driveway, it's a coin toss whether I get back.
You're coming with me.
I am?
What the hell?
You paid!
Look, I can deal with losing some of my memory.
If I didn't have to remember what's-her-name over here, I wouldn't care.
But Sal was the most important person in my life, and scrapbooks aren't doing the trick.
OK, Ma, if this is what you really want to do It's not what I want to do, it's what I have to do.
Dorothy, today is my anniversary, and I barely remember getting married.
You know, I hate getting old.
You always seem to be losing something.
First it's your eyesight.
Then people are telling you to turn down the TV set when you can barely hear it.
And you could live with that.
But this?
They're trying to take something from me that I just won't give.
I can't let this happen, Dorothy.
I can't lose my Sal.
Not again.
Isn't it good to be back in the old neighborhood, Dorothy?
Watching the kids playing stickball on the corner?
Ma, they were beating a man.
That was sort of why I called the police.
Ah, they were just having a good time.
Now, look, Ma, I don't want you to be disappointed if the new tenants don't let us in.
Buenos dÃ­as.
Oh, God!
I'm Dorothy Zbornak.
This is my mother, Mrs. Petrillo.
I know this is going to sound odd, but we used to live here many, many years ago, and we were hoping that we could look around - you know, for old times' sake.
Would that be possible?
Petrillo?
They let Italians live here?
!
Look, we came all the way from Miami.
Please?
OK.
But don't take anything.
I'm meeting my family, so I can only give you a little while.
We appreciate it very much.
You see, my mother is having a memory problem.
We were hoping that if we looked around the apartment There's no need to explain.
I have an elderly mother myself.
Oh, One more thing.
Yes?
Don't take anything.
Dorothy, look - my old wallpaper.
Oh, God, it feels the same.
And that big old window I used to look out of.
Oh, Ma, I remember when I was a little girl playing out in the street.
I can still hear your voice.
"Dorothy, fix your dress - the whole neighborhood can see your business".
Sounds like me.
Ma, we don't have too much time.
OK, let's get in the kitchen.
I want to show you that heart your father carved for me and prove to you I'm not totally crazy.
Ma, remember, it's only a carving.
Don't put all your eggs in one basket.
Hey, I may be fading, but that's the sweetest thing that man ever did for me.
I know that heart's behind the door.
I can't believe it!
They must have sanded it off.
No, Ma.
No, no.
See, Ma, it's our height chart.
You can see it through the paint.
See?
Here's Phil, Gloria, me.
I could have sworn I would have bet my life on it.
Oh, Ma, there are so many memories in this apartment.
Don't be so down.
You remember the day you brought Phil back from the hospital?
I was a little upset, because that was the day Pop usually took me to the zoo.
Well, it was the racetrack, but he called it the zoo.
You kept Phil in this room because it was the warmest room.
And I guess I was a little starved for attention, because I remember Oh, Salvadore, isn't he beautiful?
A piece of art.
But what do you have him in Dorothy's hand-me-downs for?
So he wears girls' clothes for a while - what's it gonna hurt?
Dorothy!
Sal, do something about your daughter.
Dorothy, come over here.
We know you're upset about the new baby, but we need for you to be a big girl.
Your mother's had a rough week.
First I'm called away, and then the baby's delivered by a cabby.
Cesarean!
Now I know you think Phil here's taken your place.
Well, I wanna tell you something.
I love you more than anything.
Even more than the Dodgers on five-cent beer night?
OK, even more than that.
Wow!
Daddy, I love you.
I love you, too, kiddo.
Come on, let's go to the zoo.
I got a tip on a giraffe in the sixth race.
Heh heh!
Pop sure taught me a lot about sibling rivalry that day.
When we got home I went right over to the baby and said, "I love you, Phil".
No, wait.
I wrote it on him.
Here you go, Rose.
Finished my work.
Well, turn me upside down and paint me blue!
Well, give me my money.
Look, I'm sorry we fought the way we did, but this work for senior healthcare is very important to me, and I was hoping it would be to you, too.
Well, it wasn't, but it is now.
It is?
How could I help it?
After I looked through the paperwork, I realized how expensive healthcare is for the elderly.
You know, some folks have lost their life savings.
I mean, people ought to write their congressman or something.
In fact, I am so touched, when you cut my check, don't make it out to me.
That's beautiful, Blanche.
Make it out to "Hair by Robert".
I'm not gonna declare it as income and let those lazy congressmen have my tax dollars!
Blanche, I don't wanna do that.
Oh.
Well, all right, just pay me under the table.
Oh, sure!
I know that trick.
Dorothy's done that to me before.
I go under the table and you never show up.
No way!
Boy, this room is sure alive with memories.
Those were good days.
I think I'll go up to the bedroom.
Sal and I spent our most intimate moments there.
Ma Ma, is there anything I can do for you?
Yeah, stay out.
You barged in on me enough when you were a kid.
Sally, what's going on?
What's wrong with me?
You think you got problems?
Try being dead.
Heh heh.
Sal!
What the hell are you doing here?
Relax.
I'm not really here.
I'm just a Fig Newton of your imagination.
Oh, Sal, it's been so long, I've forgotten how much you used to like Norm Crosby.
So, how are things?
"How are things"?
!
Sal, talk to me.
How are you?
What's new?
What's heaven like?
You know, everyone thinks heaven is right above.
Actually, it's a little more to the left.
What's God like?
Nice.
You should see his car!
Oh, before I forget, Gladys says hello.
You fooling around with Gladys?
Of course not.
Gladys is going out with Charlemagne.
Sophia, I see from upstairs you've kind of lost your spunk.
What's the matter?
I'm slipping, Sal, and it's frightening.
I'm even forgetting you, forgetting the good old days.
And what, I'm supposed to feel sorry for you?
That'd be a start!
Nah, the Sophia I know is a survivor.
That's why we got married.
You beat out a lot of other women.
Oh, yeah, there was a helluva long line waiting to get to you, Sal!
What's the name of that girl with the warts?
You see?
Some things you do remember.
Yeah, but only some things.
I'm 83, Sal.
I don't have the energy for this.
You have lost your spunk.
You know, maybe I don't find you so attractive anymore.
What?
!
You're not the same Sophia.
I wonder how Gladys and Charlemagne are doing.
Sure, the guy rewrote history, but can he juggle?
Salvadore Petrillo, you miserable botchagaloop!
If you so much as look at another ghost See?
There's the spunk.
It's still there.
But use it for yourself, not on me.
You think I can be OK?
If I didn't, would I have made the trip?
I miss you, Sally.
Hey, I'm always with you.
And when the time's right, see you at my place.
Ma.
Ma, Mr. Hernandez has to go.
I'm meeting the wife and kids.
We are going ice-skating.
Dorothy!
Oh, my God!
Can you believe it?
Hey, Puerto Ricans can ice-skate!
Jeez!
Dorothy!
Dorothy, look!
It's the carving.
See?
"Sal loves Sophia".
Oh, Ma!
You're Sophia?
That's right.
And I remembered.
I mixed up the rooms, but I remembered.
Of course.
I thought the carving was in the kitchen.
Sal used to hang his salamis in here.
Dorothy, I may be fading, but I'm still holding on to some of the big things.
Yeah, and you might get more back.
"Might"?
I insist!
All I need is a little more spunk.
Imagine finding that carving in here!
Kitchen, bedroom - I knew it was a room I was good in!
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Hi, Ma.
What you doing?
Thinking.
About what?
About wind, water, rocks.
Man's place in the delicate balance of nature's harmony.
Where we're going.
Where the road ends.
Gee, Ma, I never knew you were so philosophical.
I'm not.
It's those damn Infiniti commercials.
They're driving me crazy.
Hello!
Where is everybody?
We're out here, Rose.
Hi.
What's all that?
Weight-loss products I have to test for work.
You wouldn't believe the length people go to just to drop a few pounds.
I heard about one woman who even had her jaw wired shut.
Oh.
Is that something that you'll be testing, Rose?
Oh, here you all are.
How'd your physical go?
Oh, just fine.
The doctor could not believe it when I told him my age.
Why?
What age did you tell him?
Blanche, what is that thing?
She's decided to install a change machine.
Oh, it's, um, it's called a Holter monitor.
It makes a ticker tape of the heart.
What's wrong with your heart?
Oh, nothing.
Dr. Stein just thought it sounded a little irregular.
I think it's 'cause I was so uncomfortable sittin' there topless with a strange man.
Next time, just pretend you're at home and he's the bug guy.
Blanche, what did the doctor say?
Oh, he just muttered something in Latin.
I explained to him that Simon and I have been going out every night, and it's just fatigue.
And then what did he say?
He wants to match the heartbeats that this records to my activities, so, for the next 24 hours, I have to write down everything I do.
And you're not embarrassed to have him read that smut?
I'm proud of you, Blanche.
Boy, if this were me, I would be really scared.
When I'm scared, I put my head between my knees.
That's for nausea.
When I'm scared, I'm nauseous.
You remember what happened when that man tried to steal my purse?
Worked better than mace.
Honey, I'm sure there's nothing to worry about.
Well, anyway, all the same I've gotta get busy writin' down my activities, and I'd better call Simon and cancel our date for tonight.
You know, I'm really starting to care about him, and I wouldn't want him worrying about my recording his performance.
You know how fragile men's egos are.
One little thing like screaming out the wrong name, and they go all to pieces.
Nice pants, Rose.
They're called vacuum slacks.
It's supposed to inhale all the fat from your body.
Watch.
I  I must've done it wrong.
Maybe I ought to put it on suck.
Oh, hello, ladies.
What'd the doctor say?
Oh, bad news.
Oh, what?
Oh, he told me he was married.
Besides that, Blanche.
Oh, well He was a little concerned because my pulse was slow and misbehavin'.
Rose, those pants, not with those shoes.
Blanche, the doctor.
You know how they get over the slightest little thing.
And?
And Dr. Worrywart wants me to check into the hospital for more tests.
Dorothy, have you been fooling around with my Tip O'Neill calendar?
No, Ma, I haven't.
Come on!
I'm missing March.
It's the month where he's playing volleyball with Jesse Helms.
Ma, not now!
Blanche's doctor wants her to go back to the hospital for more tests.
It makes sense, just to be on the safe side.
Of course it does.
What kind of doctor would he be if he didn't wanna check out everything?
Yeah, well, if it makes him happy.
If everything's as bad as he thinks it is, he wants to put a pacemaker in me.
Everybody's got a nickname for it.
I don't think I've ever been so scared in all my life.
You know what I do when I'm scared?
You toss your cookies.
I mean besides that.
I sing.
You what?
A lullaby my mother used to sing to me when I was a little girl.
So, when I'm scared or alone, I sing it and it gives me courage.
No song is gonna help me.
Over there Over there Send the word, send the word over there That the Yanks are coming That is the lullaby that your mother sang to you?
Well, it was the only song she knew.
During World War I she gave out donuts and coffee to the doughboys before they boarded the trains for Europe.
It works, truly.
She said no one can be scared when they hear that song, except maybe the Kaiser.
I don't need a song.
I just wanna be young and beautiful and healthy again.
Blanche, that's what we all want.
I know, but I deserve it.
How are we feeling, Mrs. Devereaux?
A little nervous.
You really don't need makeup.
Well, I wanna look good just in case.
Just in case what?
In case something should go wrong.
I've been to enough funerals to see how they make up dead people.
They look like clowns.
You expect to see a dozen of 'em jump out of one coffin.
Well, nothing will go wrong.
I've done this a hundred times.
You'll be fine in a week.
All we do is cut a small incision below the collarbone, make a little pocket for the pacemaker under the muscle, then feed a tiny wire through the vein and into the heart.
Then the pacemaker gives little electric shocks to the valve which regulates the heartbeat.
You mean you're gonna cut into me?
You did know that.
Won't that leave a scar?
Two inches, tops.
Oh, I'm sorry, but I can't have any scars.
See, my clothes are all off-the-shoulder.
Sooner or later.
Sorry.
I have to give this some more thought.
No, no.
We don't have time for that.
Everybody's already washed their hands.
Believe me, it'll be all right.
Is anything wrong?
She just realized there's going to be a scar.
It's really just last-minute stage fright.
All my patients have it.
Oh, honey, I'm sure it'll be nothing.
You'll hardly notice it.
That madman wants to rip me open from stem to stern.
Your two favorite parts.
Are we ready?
I reckon so.
How do I look?
They won't be able to take their eyes off you.
Over there  Over there Send the word, send the word over there That the Yanks are coming, the Yanks are coming The drums rum-tumming everywhere Say a prayer, say a prayer Send the word, send the word to beware How's Blanche?
She's fine.
She'll be up and back on her back in no time.
Sophia, It's been wonderful watching you take care of Blanche all week.
I feel like a regular hospital worker.
Ah, that's nice.
Yeah.
I just took all the money and jewelry out of her nightstand.
Where's my money, old woman?
I knew that would get her up.
I was born to heal.
Here's your money, and your high school ring, class of Give me that.
Oh, Blanche, it's good to see you back to your old self again.
But don't forget the doctor said nothing too strenuous for a few days, then you'll be fine.
I am not back to my old self.
As a matter of fact, I may never be.
What are you talking about?
I know this sounds crazy, and if it hadn't happened to me, I wouldn't believe it either, but while I was being operated on, I had an out-of-body experience.
I was floating, looking down at myself.
I-it was like it was like Like the mirror on your bedroom ceiling?
It was like I was my own conscience.
That's when I knew things were different.
Different how?
I was in that gray area between life and death.
The time has come for me to re-evaluate my life, for me to take stock of myself.
I just know that there's a part of me that nobody's ever seen.
I find that hard to believe.
If a 5,000-year-old Indian shows up, tell him I wanna know more about his people.
Hey, Dorothy, guess who's on Johnny Carson tonight?
Who?
Johnny Carson.
Must be the anniversary show.
Rose, what's that supposed to be?
A flab stimulator.
You hook these things to your muscles.
They give out an electric charge and help get rid of unwanted fat deposits.
Does it come in a hat?
Where's Blanche?
She's out on a date with Simon.
It's her first time out, so who knows when she'll be home?
Checkout time is usually noon.
You know, Blanche has been without a date for weeks.
I know that because all the pictures on my wall are straight.
Hey, it's never easy to go without.
I remember when my mother-in-law came to stay with Sal and me when we were first married.
For two months your father and I didn't have sex.
Why not, Ma?
She slept in between us.
It was a very small place.
Have you ever seen an Italian after he's gone without?
Hm, no.
That's because your father was the only one.
She finally left, didn't she, Sophia?
Yeah.
I'll never forget that day.
Your father stayed home from work.
Unfortunately, I couldn't get the day off.
I don't know what he did, but he was happy when I got home.
Since Charlie was a traveling salesman, sometimes I'd be alone for weeks.
I used to have so much trouble sleeping, I tried counting sheep.
Rose, if there are real sheep in this story, I do not wanna hear it.
OK.
Oh, hi.
Oh, Simon.
Good to see you again.
How have you been?
A little lonely, but I'm better now.
Oh, that's sweet.
I cannot believe how much I've missed this little girl.
This guy is growing antlers.
I guess I'd better say goodnight.
I had a very nice time.
You mean, uh, our date is over?
Well, we went to dinner and a movie.
Wh-what's left?
I never know.
I'm sorry.
I-I'm just not ready yet.
You understand.
Of course, as long as it's my only choice.
I've had a life-altering experience, Simon.
I need time to think, to gather my priorities and put 'em all in perspective.
Whatever you need.
I'll call you tomorrow?
Sure.
You're not upset, are you?
No, no, no.
Boy, what a beautiful night.
Think I'll push the car home.
Your date is over?
You sound surprised.
Well, it's just that your dates usually end with a little pillow talk.
Yeah, like, "What did you say your name was again"?
I would've expected my three best friends to understand that I'm just not ready yet.
But, Blanche, the doctor said you could do everything you did before.
That's all very well for him to say.
The doctor's not me.
Blanche, what are you saying?
I've made a decision.
Blanche Devereaux has given up sex.
And what does that do to the morale of our boys overseas?
Good news, girls.
I've gained four pounds.
How is that good news?
Well, it means that all those weight-loss products don't work.
Now, to lose those four pounds I guess I'll have to go on a sensible diet that I know gets results - the St. Olaf "I can't believe this is cheese" diet.
How does it work?
You eat nothing but rice.
Good morning, ladies.
Dorothy, a Popsicle-stick purse for you.
Sophia, a Popsicle-stick potpourri box, and for you, Rose, two lovely Popsicle-stick earrings.
So, Blanche, how are we enjoying our celibacy?
Oh, just let me get a Popsicle.
I'll be right with you.
Blanche, I'm worried.
That's all you've been living on for two weeks.
Well, if I don't eat the Popsicle, how am I gonna get to the stick?
I'm glad you found a hobby, but, uh, I don't think Blanche Devereaux is going to be happy making things out of Popsicle sticks instead of making love.
Oh, I don't care about that anymore.
I don't care about anything anymore.
Life has no meaning.
So, who's for popcorn?
I don't know what to expect of myself with this thing in me.
I just keep remembering how you're not supposed to overload electrical outlets.
Maybe you just shouldn't make love when you're wet.
It was not an easy decision, but it's best that I retire from the sexual arena undefeated.
Time I hung up my gloves.
Gloves?
Boy, you do practice safe sex.
Sex is only good when your heart is in it, and that's the one organ I can't count on.
Oh, now, come on, Blanche.
You don't know that.
If that's the way you feel, maybe you should tell Simon so that he'll know where he stands.
For the last two weeks, he's been standing with his legs crossed.
I will.
I'll tell him tonight.
I can't believe it.
Blanche has gone without for two weeks.
I mean, that's like Raymond Burr saying, "No gravy".
What do you think is the matter with her?
Maybe when she had that out-of-body experience, she didn't get back in all the way.
Try to discuss science with kids.
Um I wanna thank you for a lovely evening.
I didn't think you noticed.
You hardly said a word all evening.
Where are the other girls?
Oh, they all went out to a movie.
Simon, that's why I wanted to come back here.
I wanted us to be alone.
Ooh, baby.
What?
Um Here.
I don't really know how to say this.
I never thought I'd ever be sayin' this in my wildest dreams, and you know just how wild they can get.
What I'm trying to tell you, Simon The last time we made love was the last time.
I guess it's just lucky that we took those snapshots.
What are you talking about?
I am giving up the physical side of my life.
After what I've been through, I cannot trust myself to climb the heights of passion anymore, 'cause I can't be sure of ever gettin' back again.
I know you have to be concerned about the pacemaker.
Wouldn't you be?
Blanche, everyone I know over 50 over 40 has a pacemaker.
They all lead perfectly normal lives in every way, Blanche.
But this is in me.
Oh, Simon, for the first time in my life I'm I'm just scared of intimacy.
Maybe this is my fault.
Maybe I've been pushing you.
It's not you.
Blanche, you're the same person that you always were.
You have to believe that.
Oh, I-I want to, Simon, and I have tried, but I can't.
Darling, this is not the time for your vivid imagination to give out on us.
Goodbye, Simon.
Well, if you're gonna kiss me off, I want my kiss.
Are you all right?
I think so.
I don't feel any sparks.
Well, in this instance I'll take that as a compliment.
I am a little hot, but it's nothing I can't handle.
What did you expect to happen?
I don't know.
I just kept seeing those cartoon characters with the smoke coming out of their ears.
I don't see anything.
Listen.
There's a great big old television set back in my bedroom.
What do you say we go in there and turn it off?
Long as you understand I can't make any promises.
If you'll be brave, I'll be brave.
Ma, I said I was sorry.
The least you can do when we're gonna see a movie is say it's a foreign film.
What is the big deal?
I had to stand at the front of the screen all that running back and forth to complete a sentence almost killed me.
Wasn't that Simon's car parked out front?
Are you sure?
Blanche?
She's not in here.
Maybe she had trouble with her pacemaker, and since we weren't here, she called him.
Oh, my God.
Over there Over there No, I said over there!
Send the word, send the word over there
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Pussycat, when's the last time I told you you were beautiful?
June 1, 1949.
At my wedding.
Oh, well.
That's because pregnant women have that special glow.
It's time to tell you again.
You're a beautiful woman.
What do you want, Ma?
You're so suspicious.
I'm hurt.
This is why the compliments only come every 40 years.
I'm sorry, Ma.
Sorry enough to be in the Shady Pines mother-daughter beauty pageant?
Ma, you hate Shady Pines.
Why do you want to go back?
Two words - Gladys Goldfine.
Ma, just because you don't like the woman doesn't mean that we have to embarrass ourselves in public.
This contest is my chance to put that old witch in her place, once and for all.
Not only am I a looker, but I have a daughter twice as beautiful as hers.
Ma, that's very sweet, but I still-- And then I thought, "Wait".
Your sister Gloria is in California.
So it's you or nothing.
Please, Dorothy.
If we win this thing, I can die a happy woman.
Ma, I refuse to be a part of your neurotic need to be number one.
Now, just let it go.
How many challenges do I have left in life?
Seeing if I can get halfway across the street before the "Don't Walk" sign comes on.
Trying to stay awake on the john.
Hoping it is the john.
Competition is the thing that keeps me going.
But, if you want me to let it go.
All right.
All right, Ma, I'll do it.
You've made me a happy woman.
Now, if you want to go the extra mile, I hear one of the judges has a fetish Dorothy's gonna be in the mother-daughter beauty pageant with me.
Oh, really?
Listen, I know one of the judges.
Just keep telling the little bald guy he's been naughty.
Hello, my name is David Patten.
I'm looking for a Mr. George Devereaux.
Yeah, I'll get him.
Oh, he's dead.
My husband passed away a few years ago.
Oh, I see.
What did you want George for?
I'm selling encyclopedias and his name was at the top of my list of leads.
I hope I haven't bothered you.
And I'm truly sorry about your husband.
Oh, now, that is really odd.
I mean, if he's selling encyclopedias, why didn't he try to sell us a set?
You know what else is so strange about it?
He didn't bring them in.
Rose.
No encyclopedia salesman lugs around 26 volumes door-to-door.
Are you kidding?
In St. Olaf they carry 52.
Why?
Balance.
Rose, why don't they just carry 13 in each hand?
Excuse me.
I have to make a phone call.
Dorothy, Rose.
The oddest thing just happened to me at the market.
I saw that same young man who was here the other day, looking for George.
What was his name?
David something or other?
What's so odd about that?
He was shopping.
He wasn't shopping, Dorothy.
He was undressing me with his eyes.
That handsome young man is obviously smitten.
I don't know about that.
If he had a crush on you, why did he ask about George?
Because he's been in love from afar, and that was his way of approaching.
But he he lost his nerve at the door.
Look, if you are right, I think you're taking this too lightly.
Sure, he may be infatuated with you, but he also might be some kind of nut.
Oh, I tell you, the boy's in love.
Rose, what do you think?
A sex-crazed psycho with a granny complex.
Sorry, Blanche.
I gotta call 'em as I see 'em.
Look, pussycat.
I've found matching dresses we could order for the evening-gown competition.
Ma, those are totally inappropriate.
Don't worry.
They come with matching panties.
For when we do the cartwheels.
Ma, forget it.
Oh, come on.
Mine are gonna say "Hello" and yours are gonna say "America".
Ma, why can't we wear something simple in basic black?
It's a bad idea, Dorothy.
You wear black at Shady Pines and they'll stop the show for a head count.
I knew I never should have gotten involved in this mother-daughter pageant.
I just wish I'd known how to say no to it.
I know what you mean.
I should have said no to the Miss St. Olaf beauty pageant.
It was 1951.
That was the first year they let humans enter too.
I was way ahead after the evening-gown and log-rolling competition.
People don't realize how hard it is to roll log when you're wearing an evening gown.
And the shocker is I lost out on the intelligence quiz.
Quelle surprise!
Don't I know it.
They asked me to name the seven dwarves, and I did.
But evidently I didn't name the seven they had in mind.
Rose, hand me that newspaper.
No.
You're gonna hit me with it.
No, I won't.
You promise?
I promise.
Guess who was waiting in a car outside our house.
David.
David, that's who.
I tell you, that car was there three hours ago when I left.
Blanche, the man is obviously obsessed with you.
I think he's a little nutty.
Now, look.
I've been involved in these fatal attractions before.
I can handle this.
I'll just go out there and tell him.
Hi, Mrs. Devereaux.
Do you remember me?
I was here the other day.
David, I want you to come in and sit down.
We have to have a talk.
I am tired of you lurking around outside my house and tailing me at the supermarket.
Now, enough is enough.
You have an unhealthy, obsessive love for me.
Honey, you need professional help.
Mrs. Devereaux, I don't have those feelings for you.
Oh.
I have been following you around, and I'm sorry.
But I have something to tell you, and well, this is just so difficult for me.
Oh.
Whenever I have something hard to say, I just say it fast.
In high school, when I wanted to break up with Carl Dugan, the captain of the football team.
Well, I was very nervous.
So I just spat it right out.
"Carl, I'm dumping you for Coach Wilkins".
Afterwards, I felt much better.
You just go ahead and tell me.
Go ahead.
OK.
George Devereaux, your husband, was my father.
Get out.
What?
Get out of my house.
I did not hear what you just said.
She didn't hear what he said and she was this upset.
Can you imagine if-- Shut up, Rose.
David, why would you say a thing like that?
My mother passed away recently, and I found out that for years she had received child-support checks from a trust fund in Miami.
Well, I was always told my dad died before I was born.
Then I found my birth certificate.
And there, listed as my father, was George Devereaux.
Maybe there was another George Devereaux in Miami.
This was the address in my mom's old book.
Who also lived in this house.
Believe me, Mrs. Devereaux, if I'd known he was dead, I never would have left Dallas.
Well, now you know.
Goodbye.
I know this is painful, but there's so much I need to know.
What did he do for a living?
Was he funny?
Did he have any hobbies?
He had at least one.
You're the only one who can help me.
After you've had some time, maybe I could call you.
I'm sorry about all this.
Really.
I don't want to talk about it.
Oh, how could George betray me this way?
Dammit, those wedding vows were sacred to me.
Well, they must have been.
I turned down hundreds - thousands of offers.
Teachers, doctors, astronauts.
I even said no to a journalist famous for his work on 60 Minutes.
Now, if that's not fidelity, I don't know what is.
Then I find out that the only man I ever loved cheated on me.
On me!
Oh, I could just die.
I'll bet it was Morley Safer.
I thought you were in bed.
I couldn't sleep.
It must be from living with old people.
I've been going through my diaries.
Just listen to this.
"March 3, 1967.
George just back from Dallas.
"Surprised me with the most beautiful diamond earrings.
"I love him so much it takes my breath away.
"Ours is a love so pure, so complete, "it'll outlast time itself.
I'll have the earrings appraised next week".
See?
That proves it.
Am I missing something?
Proves what?
Dallas.
Diamond earrings.
George was obviously feeling guilty about cheating on me with David's mother.
David was telling the truth.
This is tough.
I know how you feel.
I hate to say it, but Sal almost cheated on me once.
Ma.
Really?
I was pregnant with your brother Phil.
Just because I put on 40lbs and was crying all the time, your father got the wandering eye.
Did you ever find out who it was?
I never actually met her, but I heard she was a short, scrawny, birdlike thing who never shut up.
I guess variety is the spice of life.
My Charlie never cheated on me.
I think it was because the divorce laws were so stringent in St. Olaf.
The wife gets to keep everything that doesn't ferment.
Well, thank you, Rose, for rubbing my nose in the fact that you had a faithful husband Why did George cheat on me?
Why does any man cheat?
Well, there are two popular theories.
One, men are victims of an evolutionary process which genetically programs their sexual habits.
What's the other theory?
Men are scum.
OK, girls.
I'm ready.
Well, Rose, do I look like the mayor of Palm Springs?
Doug Henning is the mayor of Palm Springs?
Just play the music, Rose.
They say we're young and we don't know We won't find out until we grow I don't know if all that's true But you got me and, baby, I got you Babe I got you, babe I got you, babe They say our love won't pay the rent  Rose, what's wrong?
There's another verse.
I'm sorry.
But this song always takes me back to St. Olaf in the '60s.
And the controversial issue that nearly tore the town apart.
What, Rose?
Vietnam?
Civil rights?
Campus unrest?
Opposite-side-of-the-street parking.
Nobody could understand the concept.
It doesn't matter which side you park on, there's always an opposite side.
What an injustice.
Hemingway ran out of stories to tell and shot himself.
She just keeps on going.
Oh, for goodness' sakes.
Why, you two could be celebrity look-alikes.
Blanche.
You really think so?
Well, absolutely.
So, which one's Cheech and which one's Chong?
I'm Sonny Bono, you idiot.
Gee, I wonder how many maÃ®tre d's have heard that line.
Blanche, there's something I need to tell you.
I've told a lie and now I have a guilty conscience.
Really?
You know, I've heard that could happen.
I lied to you when I said Charlie never cheated on me.
You know, he was this traveling salesman, and one very dark night he ran out of gas in front of this farmhouse.
He knocked on the door and asked the farmer if he could spend the night.
The farmer said, "There's only one place you can sleep.
That's with my daughter".
The ironic thing was, if it had been light out, Charlie would have realized that he was just two blocks away from home.
It was really embarrassing.
That story really got around.
I must have heard it a hundred times.
Everybody thought it was a big joke.
That must have hurt.
Yeah, it hurt a lot.
It made me angry.
I was so mad, I refused to make strudel for a year.
That's not so bad.
"Strudel" was our little pet name for sex.
Wow.
You were mad.
You bet.
But I decided one mistake shouldn't erase the memories of all the good times, or how much we loved each other.
Don't throw George's memory away just 'cause he made a mistake.
Come on, guys.
We're gonna be late.
I'll get the car.
I'll meet you in front.
Oh!
You all look beautiful.
Why, thank you.
Well, David!
What are you doing here?
I'm going back to Dallas tonight.
But before I leave, there's something I have to know.
Oh, come on in.
Y'all go on.
I'll meet you there.
What is it?
Did my father ever go fishing?
What?
When I was a kid, I fantasized about the kinds of things my father and I would have done together.
Going fishing was always my favorite.
Did he?
No.
Oh.
Look, I know my coming here hurt you.
But this wasn't any picnic for me, either.
I'm angry too.
I grew up not knowing anything about my father - who he was, what he was.
I wish you could just tell me something about my father.
Whether you like it or not, I am his son.
He served in Korea.
Really?
Army captain.
Decorated for bravery.
But not before he graduated top of his class at Vanderbilt.
That's pretty good.
Well, let's see.
There's so much to remember.
Um Well, he was charming, and quite an athlete.
Intellectual.
He could match wits with anybody in town.
Very handsome.
The ladies loved him.
Apparently so.
I really appreciate all this.
Would you like to see pictures of him?
Very much.
There he is.
I've got his eyes.
I know.
And, uh, here he is in uniform.
Wait.
Is that him?
On the boat?
Well, I'll be I guess he did go fishing after all!
Say, would you like to have this?
Really?
You ought to have it.
After all, you're his son.
Make way for the winners of the Shady Pines mother-daughter beauty contest!
Ta-da!
Oh!
You won!
Actually, we're just the runners-up.
But if the reigning winners for any reason can't fulfill their duties And I'm telling you, the winning mother and daughter are 98 and 77.
If either one of them forgets to take a nitroglycerin even once Dorothy and I are gonna be cutting ribbons at Piggly Wiggly.
But the big news is we beat Gladys Goldfine.
Right, Ma?
Ah, it was a hollow victory.
Time has taken its toll on Gladys.
She's not the fierce competitor she once was.
For the talent section she was supposed to do a medley from The Fantasticks.
She started with "Try To Remember," and she couldn't.
But more important than that, what about David?
What happened?
Well, I talked to him, and he's really a very nice young man.
I think I was taking my anger at George out on David.
You're gonna have to find a way to forgive George.
I will forgive him.
It'll just take a little time.
A little cheesecake wouldn't hurt, either.
You know, Ma, I hate to admit it - I had fun this afternoon.
I'm glad to hear that, pussycat, because the Shady Pines circus is coming up.
You're not afraid of fire, are you?
You son of a You put me through all this and I could have had Andy Rooney.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" What an idiot!
Of all the lamebrained, moronic dopes.
If ever I wanted to reach right through the phone and strangle somebody.
Not really a morning person, are you, pussycat?
It's this caterer that I hired for my Save the Wetlands banquet.
He's a week late with the menu, now he tells me that he's going to serve wild duck and crayfish.
They come from the wetlands.
It's like holding a Save the Whales function on a Japanese trawler.
Is there an open bar?
You know, Ma, that's part of the problem.
Nobody cares.
Do you realize what would happen if there were no swamps?
New Jersey wouldn't have a state smell.
I'm just in over my head.
What with the banquet, press releases, petitions to be signed.
Ma, what am I gonna do?
I'll help.
Blanche, that's sweet, but, honey, aren't your hands tied with all the work that you're doing for you?
I know I'm not always the first one to volunteer, but I happen to have an affection for bayous.
Matter of fact, I became a woman in one.
I thought you lost it in a hot-air balloon.
I thought you lost it at a pancake breakfast.
Well, those don't count.
I mean, they did at the time, but this is the definitive where-I-lost-my-virginity story.
It's really nice of you to share something so personal with us, Blanche.
In a bayou?
You slut.
Mail call.
Oh, Rose.
You're here.
That's good.
I am absolutely snowed under with this wetlands thing.
And, as usual, I know I can count on you.
I'm sorry, Dorothy.
What?
But Rose, you always help out with these things.
You're involved in all the charities.
You send a contribution to Save the Rich.
I have charity-work burn-out, Dorothy.
In the last three months I have helped with raffles and bake sales and car washes.
I have to draw the line.
Well, I guess I'll manage somehow.
What is it, Rose?
Is something wrong?
I'm not sure.
St. Luke's hospital wants me to come in for some kind of test.
That's where I had my gallbladder out six years ago.
Can I see it, Rose?
They throw organs out after surgery.
The letter, Rose.
Oh.
Hm.
Seems you had a transfusion while you were there.
The hospital thinks the blood may have contained HIV antibodies.
HI V?
Wait a minute.
You're talking about AIDS.
This has to be some kind of mistake.
Don't panic.
There's just a possibility.
This is a precaution.
Well, what do I do?
We just call up the hospital and make an appointment.
Everything will be fine.
You think so?
Why, I'm sure of it.
Now, let's plan Dorothy's fundraiser.
Hey, I know what would be fun.
Uh, Blanche, we're gonna try to raise all the money in one night.
I know.
Yes, but this is a very important-- Yes.
Yes, I understand.
I understand.
Oh, boy.
Some people.
What's wrong, Blanche?
Nobody gives a damn about this Save the Wetlands thing.
I sat in our booth of ours at the mall for three hours.
Not one soul came by and asked for information.
What we need is some kind of swamp gimmick, like "Guess how many leeches are in the jar".
I don't think so, Blanche.
All right, then.
How about a celebrity auction?
Hey, if you could buy a celebrity at an auction, I'd be showering every morning with Trini LÃ³pez.
Ma, I didn't know you liked Trini LÃ³pez.
I don't, but who can I afford on a fixed income?
You don't understand, Sophia.
A celebrity auction is where famous people donate personal items to bid on for charities.
That's a great idea, Blanche, but it's a little late.
I mean, how are we gonna find celebrities to donate stuff and donate it fast?
I can pull some strings.
It so happens I know some famous people.
Who?
I don't want to divulge his name, but I'll give you a clue.
I know what the F stands for in William F. Buckley.
Does someone want to drive me to the hospital?
Your appointment's not for three hours.
Well, I'd like to get there early.
But if you don't want to take me, I'll go without you.
I might as well get used to being by myself.
What does that mean?
Well, come on.
If that test turns out positive, you won't want to be around me.
You or Miles or anybody.
Now, that is not true.
And I'm sure Miles will feel the same way.
How am I gonna tell him?
You don't have to tell him anything now.
You're just going for a test.
It's not just a test, Dorothy.
I know just how you feel.
I remember how nervous and scared and panicked I was when I went to that neurologist to have my memory tested.
How did you handle it?
Well, usually, I add a cup of bleach.
Can I help you?
I think so.
I have a two-o'clock appointment for an AIDS blood test.
My name is Well, it's You know, we encourage anonymity, so if you'd like to give us a fictitious name for our files.
Oh, that'd be great.
Dorothy Zbornak.
Fine.
We'll call you in.
You'll be seeing a counselor and then the doctor.
Meanwhile, just take a seat, Ms Zbornak.
Dorothy Zbornak.
Z-b-o-- Let's go, Dorothy.
Boy, this is creepy.
I mean, fake names.
Well, honey, it make sense.
People who test positive have trouble getting insurance, jobs.
It's terrible.
The whole process is terrible.
I wish it were over.
It will be soon.
I haven't been this scared since 1952, when St. Olaf's most active volcano threatened to erupt.
Luckily, there were some Druid priests who were in town for the opening of Stonehengeland.
They said they could stop it if they could sacrifice the town's dumbest virgin.
I don't know why I raised my hand.
It must have just been the excitement of the moment.
But they said the only way to prevent the eruption was for me to crawl through their legs, up the volcano, while they gave me my birthday whacks.
Well - and you're not gonna believe this - it turns out they weren't Druid priests at all.
Just a bunch of Shriners looking for a good time.
That's a scary story, Rose.
Why don't they call me?
I want to get this over and go home.
Rose.
Come here, honey.
Come here.
We need to talk.
What, Blanche?
This is the kind of thing I tend to keep to myself, but I want you to know.
I got tested too, so I know what you're going through.
What did you do?
Well, I just had the test, and then I had a nice long talk with myself about being with so many men, and now when I'm with a man, I know his complete history and we take all the necessary precautions.
I just wanted you to know I understand this is not an easy time.
Thank you, Blanche.
Mrs. Zbornak.
Dorothy Zbornak?
Rose.
Well, this is it.
All right, darling, come on.
I'll go with you.
Dorothy.
Ma!
Where have you been?
I always think it's nice when you're in a hospital to walk around and cheer people up.
Ah.
That's nice, Ma.
So after I had my prescription filled, I went to up to Geriatrics and sang "Anything You Can Do, I Can Do Better".
Ma.
What a tough crowd.
They threw Jell-O at me.
If you could call that throwing.
What are you reading?
This pamphlet on AIDS and teenagers.
It's really so discouraging.
Parents don't talk to their kids about sex.
This is so important you'd think they'd get past their embarrassment.
Thank God I was one of those progressive parents.
I was amazed at how you used those technical terms.
You told me never to let a boy touch me "you know where".
And you spelled "where".
Maybe I used to be old-fashioned, but times have changed.
So when I was at the pharmacy I bought you some condoms.
Your boyfriends are supposed to put them you know w-h-e-r-e.
Rose, I wish I knew what to say to make you feel better.
Say I'm OK.
You know, we always tend to think the worst so that when the news does finally come, it's never as bad as we thought it was gonna be.
Well?
Well the good news is you appear to be in fine physical shape.
Do you have any more questions?
Of course.
Do I have it?
We'll have the results when you come back in three days.
Three days?
What are you talking about?
I expect when I go to a hospital for an AIDS test to find out.
I'm sorry.
I wish it was faster, but it takes us that long to be sure.
I thought you knew.
Well, I didn't know.
First you give me that transfusion, and now you tell me this.
Honey, I guess there's really not much you can do.
Well, sure there is.
There's plenty I can do.
Like, sit around the house for the next 72 hours, scared to death he's gonna tell me I have something that's gonna kill me.
How am I gonna do that, Blanche?
How am I gonna get through the next three days?
Thank you.
What do you mean, you're canceling?
Is there anything I can say to change your mind?
I understand.
Yeah.
Goodbye.
Swell.
Now I don't have a band for the banquet.
What happened?
They decided to play at the Free Noriega benefit.
Hi, girls.
Rose, what were you doing out so early this morning?
I couldn't sleep so I went for a spin last night.
To Alabama.
Blanche, do you know at a truck stop in Tuscaloosa they have an egg dish named after you.
Really?
How are they prepared?
Overeasy.
Rose, are you OK?
I'm fine.
Never better.
In fact, I'm so fine that I've decided not to even get my results.
Oh, now, Rose-- Oh!
Look at all this stuff for the celebrity auction.
Linda Evans' compact.
Now, look, Rose-- What about the dress Jamie Farr promised us from M*A S*H?
It hasn't come yet.
But he promised.
Honey, we have a lot of other stuff.
It's OK.
No, it's not.
He let you down.
Well, I'm not surprised.
You couldn't trust Klinger on guard duty, you can't trust him now.
Rose, take it easy.
Oh, I'm the one who's supposed to take it easy?
Me?
When the Klingers of the world are kicking us in the teeth.
Rose, you're hysterical.
Wait, I've seen this in the movies.
How could he do this?
What is wrong with the man?
Ma, you almost got it.
Listen, I think we're all under a little stress here.
Now, I have an idea.
How about lunch and a movie?
My treat.
Why not?
I still have another 52 hours to kill.
Oh, this is rough.
I feel terrible.
Yeah, I really feel guilty.
Jamie Farr's dress did come.
I just remembered where I put it.
Where?
How do I look?
Ma, what were you doing in my bathroom for two hours?
The hokey-pokey.
What do you think I was doing?
Why were you using my bathroom?
There's something wrong with mine.
What?
Rose used it.
Ma, that is just ignorant paranoia.
Hey, I'm making progress.
Yesterday I used the bathroom down at the Shell station.
It's attitudes like that that add to the panic about this.
Now, what is wrong with you?
Hey, one little slip and you're all over my back.
It won't happen again.
Relax.
Why is there an R on some of our coffee cups?
Uh, R for "Regular".
Blank ones are decaf.
I don't believe you.
Look.
I know intellectually there's no way I can catch it.
But now that it's so close to home, it's scary.
Well, Sophia, I'm afraid you're just gonna have to get over that.
I'll try.
I'll try.
I'm usually not like this.
I've been using your toothbrush for months.
Hi, Rose.
What's going on?
Oh, I'm just sitting here kicking myself for not taking care of my gallbladder.
For going to that hospital for the operation, and for letting them give me blood without asking first: "Oh, excuse me, are you sure this isn't gonna kill me one day"?
Now, now, Rose.
Take it easy.
Why does everyone keep saying that?
I don't feel like taking it easy.
I might have AIDS, and it scares the hell out of me.
Yet every time I open my mouth to talk about it, somebody says, "There, there, Rose.
Take it easy".
I'm sorry, honey.
Why me, Blanche?
I'm tired of pretending I feel OK so you won't say "Take it easy".
And I'm tired of you saying "Take it easy" 'cause you're afraid I'm gonna fall apart.
Dammit.
Why is this happening to me?
I mean this isn't supposed to happen to people like me.
You must have gone to bed with hundreds of men.
All I had was one innocent operation.
Hey!
Wait a minute.
Are you saying this should be me and not you?
No.
No, I'm just saying that I am a good person.
Hell, I'm a goody two shoes.
AIDS is not a bad person's disease, Rose.
It is not God punishing people for their sins.
You're right, Blanche.
You're damn straight I'm right.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
Don't apologize.
This is what I want.
Oh, God.
This waiting is driving me crazy.
Blanche, when you were tested, how did you make it through?
Just kept it to myself and acted like a real bitch to everybody else.
No wonder we never knew.
These three days are killing Rose.
What she needs from us are calm heads.
Then that's what she'll get.
Oh, God.
You gave me an R cup!
Ma, will you stop that?
Here.
Listen, we are the only family Rose has here, so we have to help her through whatever she's going through.
Right.
Sure.
So, here's to Rose.
Whatever happens, whatever those tests show, we're here for her.
Dorothy, gimme that.
Oh, Rose, excuse me.
I didn't know you were out here.
It's OK, Dorothy.
I was just praying.
Trying to put in a good word for tomorrow.
What are you doing?
Oh, just working on this stupid flier for my stupid banquet.
It's not important.
Sure it is.
It's OK, Rose.
No, it is important.
What's the matter?
I've rewritten this thing three times, and the most persuasive slogan I can come up with is: "Save our swamps.
No, really, we mean it".
I like it.
No, you don't.
No, I don't.
It sounds like I'm selling mosquitoes, Rose.
Not that they don't serve a purpose.
All life is precious.
I care about our wetlands.
I just wish they were more glamorous, you know?
I mean, I'm trying to save something that you can't go into without wearing hip boots.
Well, some people might chuckle, but I think what you're doing is important.
I mean, people laughed at me back in St. Olaf when I spearheaded the drive to get our very own missile silo.
Oh, sure, some gloomy Gusses muttered about the plutonium thing.
But I figured if we could make our sleepy little hamlet into a first-strike target, it would help tourism.
You know, it sounds like we both have a little trouble with groups.
Maybe so.
You know that, in school, I actually joined the math club so I could meet guys.
Really.
Oh, I can beat that.
I joined the Four-H Club to be hip.
The Aldo Ray fan club.
I can beat that too.
What?
No, I can't.
That's pretty bad.
That felt good.
It's been a bad week.
It'll get better.
It's weird.
I wanted those three days over, and now that they are, I kinda feel I'd like some of it back.
I mean, any second, that door is gonna open, and that doctor is gonna tell me my future.
Your future's gonna be filled with nothing but joy and laughter.
Thank you, Sophia.
Don't thank me, thank The Miami Herald.
It's your horoscope.
Good morning, ladies.
Good morning.
I hope you don't mind.
These are my friends.
Not at all.
Your test results were fine, Mrs. Zbornak.
Oh, that's great!
Well, sure, that's great for you, Dorothy, but what about me?
Rose.
Rose, you used my name.
You remember?
Right!
Well, then, I'm fine too.
I'm fine!
Oh, thank you, God.
I wish you'd told me on the phone.
The last couple of hours were the hardest.
I know.
But even people who test negative often need more counseling.
Oh, I feel wonderful.
I feel great!
Well, evidently, you had all the emotional support you needed.
I know what you've been through.
I'm very happy things turned out.
Thank you, Doctor.
Hey!
Oh!
Oh, he's right.
You guys were terrific.
Thank you for being there for me.
And thank you for making me feel you'd always be there for me, no matter what happened.
Bet you'd like to go home and rest.
No!
I haven't felt like I've been living for the last three days.
I want to go with you to the fundraiser.
Great!
It's going to be a success.
Ma must have stuffed and mailed over 500 invitations.
"Stuffed"?
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Thank you.
Pussycat, I'm going out.
Can you give me some money?
What happened to the money I gave you last night?
Let's see.
Ten bucks went for cover charge, ten bucks went for a round of drinks.
And the other ten went into the G-string of a very cute male dancer named Mr. Big.
I know that guy.
That's just a stage name.
Ma, I don't like this new crowd that you're hanging out with.
Why are you with these people?
They're the in-crowd.
Look, the Senior Citizens' Center is divided into three cliques - the hip group, the not-so-hip group and the broken hip group.
Which group would you wanna be in?
Ma, when I was a kid, you told me it wasn't important to be in a popular clique.
You always said, "Just be yourself".
Sure, that was because no one liked you.
This is why, when I was a kid, I had an imaginary mother.
I can't believe it.
Buzz Mueller just called.
He's in town.
Buzz Mueller?
I haven't seen Buzz in almost 40 years, since we were dating in high school.
Rose, I didn't think you dated anyone before Charlie.
Actually, it was while I dated Charlie.
Rose Nylund.
You were in a love triangle and never told us.
I didn't think you'd be interested.
But you were certain that we'd be interested in the story about little Yimminy, the boy who was raised by a wild moose?
May I remind you, Dorothy, that moose didn't just raise little Yimminy, he put him through medical school.
Why were you dating Buzz at the same time as Charlie?
Because I didn't know which one I liked better.
They were so different.
Charlie liked to do all the typical teenage things.
When we'd go to a drive-in movie, he'd hide me in the trunk so we only had to pay admission for one.
After the movie he'd drive me home, let me out of the trunk and tell me all about it.
But I was looking for someone more exciting.
That's when Buzz came along.
He was St. Olaf's heppest cat.
A musician - you know the type.
He once put a whole box of Chiclets in his mouth on a dare.
Cool.
Well, I almost married Buzz.
We were talking about it when he got a call from the Spike Jones Band.
They need someone to make the whoop sound when Spike dropped his pants.
Just before he went to New York, Buzz told me he'd be back, but I never saw him again.
I waited for a while, but one gig led to another Meanwhile, Charlie and I got closer.
You know what happened after that.
Well, did Buzz ever get married?
No.
He just traveled the world playing his music.
So how did you finally get over Buzz?
I never really did entirely.
To this day, whenever I see a man drop his pants, some little part of me wants to go whoop!
I know what you mean.
Ma, we need to talk.
I waited up for you until two in the morning.
And you still weren't home.
Oh, yeah.
Gertie and I and some of the girls went to Wolfie's to pick up guys.
I called Wolfie's at 11.
You weren't there.
Guess who got lucky?
Oh, God.
What can I tell you?
A couple of egg creams, the fluorescent lights, and a retired jeweler named Schlomo all conspired to make a night of enchantment.
Not for me.
I can't tell you some of the horrible thoughts I had about what might have happened to you, although none as horrible as what you just described.
You're making too much of this.
No, I'm not.
Ma, I'm putting my foot down.
I don't like this new crowd.
So from now on I want you home at 11.
They're my friends and I like them.
I'm sorry, Ma.
This is the way it's going to be as long as you're living with me.
Good morning.
Blanche, I'm giving you 30 days' notice.
What?
I don't wanna live under this roof anymore.
I'm moving.
Don't give it a second thought.
Good morning, ladies.
Good morning, Miles.
How was the bird-watching?
Oh, Blanche, it was thrilling.
Have you eve seen a purple martin early in the morning?
Yes, I have.
Martin Gelman.
Mr. "Watch me leapfrog over this parking meter".
Well, Rose, you wanna go see a movie tonight?
Actually, I'm expecting an old boyfriend from high school.
His name's Buzz Mueller and I haven't seen him in 40 years.
But if this really bothers you?
Oh, no.
I totally understand.
It's too bad.
I was gonna take you to see Henry V. It's just as well.
I always think by the time they get to number five, those sequels get pretty predictable.
Goodbye, Rose.
Goodbye.
I can't believe you told him that.
But it's true.
Did you doubt for a minute Rocky was gonna beat that Russian?
I mean didn't you leave out some important details about your relationship with Buzz?
No.
She did exactly the right thing.
I never tell men about my past.
Why?
Takes too long.
Rose.
Buzz.
You're blonde.
You let your eyebrows grow back.
You like 'em?
Love 'em.
You are incredibly beautiful.
Oh, thank you, Buzz.
These are my roommates, Dorothy and Blanche.
Hello, there.
Pleased to meet you.
Tell me, Buzz, is "Buzz" short for something?
No.
Actually, it's not an unusual name in St. Olaf.
Everybody in my family is named Buzz.
Buzz and I are going out to lunch.
You're kidding?
Buzz is here too?
Sorry, girls.
This one's mine.
Ma, you're still here?
I thought you were moving.
I will be, smarty-pants.
I found out about this agency that matches elderly people with roommates.
Hello.
Hi, Miles.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I can't make it tonight.
I have a 24-hour Buzz bug!
Well, I'll call you tomorrow.
Thanks.
Bye-bye.
I should have told him I have a date with Buzz.
God, I hate me right now.
What a shame.
We finally have something in common and I'm moving.
I've never done anything like this before.
Tell me, is it possible to love two men at the same time?
Set the scene.
Have we been drinking?
Rose, are you saying that you love Buzz?
I don't know, but these last few days with him have been wonderful.
When I'm with him it feels like old times.
Hi, adorable.
Ladies.
Wow, you're the first sighted person I've ever seen in a suit like that.
I'm dressed like this because the band just had a rehearsal for our European tour.
It's a beauty.
Rose, how about some ice cream?
You ladies care to join us?
No thanks.
We don't wanna spoil our dinner.
Not that that outfit hasn't done a good job already.
Buzz, I'm not sure I should go.
You see, I haven't been totally honest with you.
I'm involved with someone else.
His name is Miles and he means a lot to me.
Rosie, I never should have left you 40 years ago.
I can still see you standing on the platform as the train started to roll by.
Remember, Rose?
You were walking alongside, tears rolling down your cheeks.
When the train picked up a little speed, you started to run.
Suddenly you were out of sight.
It was very painful for me.
For me too.
I ran face first into the crossing signal.
Rose, have dinner with me tonight.
You know, Miles can have you for the rest of his life, but I've only got tonight.
OK.
But I don't want you to stand out in that outfit.
I'll go change into something plaid.
Hi, girls.
Hi, Rose.
How was dinner with Buzz?
He asked me to go to Europe with him.
Rose, what about Miles?
I don't know.
I honestly don't know.
For some reason, Buzz just doesn't wanna take Miles with us.
Well, I'm leaving.
I found a compatible roommate.
There's my new address and number.
Come on.
Ma, you're joking.
It's no joke.
Ciao, auf Wiedersehen, arrivederci and sayonara.
Gee, she could have at least said goodbye.
Oh, it's you.
I thought maybe Sophia had come home.
Oh, no.
She'll be back in the morning.
She's trying to teach me a lesson.
I know my mother.
Oh, really?
You're the one who said she wasn't gonna leave in the first place.
Dorothy, it's not just your mother who left.
I feel like she's my mother too.
I know, honey, but don't worry.
She'll be back.
Now that she's gone, who am I gonna go to in the middle of the night with my deepest personal problems?
Wait a minute.
You went to my mother's room in the middle of the night?
Many, many times.
Two or three times a week.
And she was always so kind and comforting.
I don't understand.
Every time I'd knock on her door late at night, she'd say, "Not now.
I'm watching Bob Costas".
Sophia doesn't have a TV in her room.
I know.
Then after we'd finished talking, she'd always give me a piece of hard candy and a kiss goodnight.
I can't sleep.
And what's worse, I went to Sophia's room for one of our talks and then I remembered she left, thanks to you, Dorothy.
You had late-night talks with my mother?
All the time.
And she gave you hard candy?
No.
I'd ask, but she was always afraid I'd choke on it.
We just gotta get her back.
Don't worry.
One sleepless night in a strange bed will be enough for her.
In the morning, I'll go over and bring her back.
Sophia's not the only one with a sleepless night ahead of her.
To tell you the truth, I don't know what to do about Buzz.
This might be a second chance at love.
I'm thinking of going to Europe with him.
Rose, quite frankly, I don't get it.
What is this hold that Buzz has over you?
I know exactly what she's going through.
First love can be very powerful.
I felt the same way about Hayward Boyle, the star pitcher on our high school baseball team.
An amazing athlete.
That boy had exceptional control.
He was always up for extra innings.
And his delivery-- All right, Blanche.
Enough!
Yeah, we get it.
So what was he like in bed?
Good morning, Maria.
Good morning, Mrs. Petrillo.
Did you have trouble sleeping?
No.
Why?
Last night I woke up and you were sitting on a chair in my room.
Oh, yeah.
Well, where I used to live, the bathroom was across the hall.
Sorry.
It won't happen again.
Should I draw your bath?
I can draw my own bath.
I can do everything by myself.
OK, Mrs. Petrillo.
You're the boss.
Look, I'm not the boss.
I'm a poor immigrant from Italy and I feel uncomfortable having somebody wait on me hand and foot.
I'll get it.
Sit.
Oh, my God.
Oh, Dorothy, look at this.
Oh!
What do you want?
Well, we were just in the neighborhood.
We thought we'd stop by and see if you need anything.
Obviously better security.
Oh, Dorothy, the art in this room is magnificent.
I know.
I work in a museum.
I'm an art expert.
Look at this Renoir.
Actually, that's a Seurat.
His signature style was pointillism.
Notice how the little dots of color seem to blend together from a distance.
Oh, yeah.
Wanna see the Jackson Pollock in the john?
I'd love to.
Come on.
I gotta scrub the toilet anyway.
Ma, we have to talk.
There's nothing to talk about.
Oh, here's my roomie.
Hi, Malcolm.
Who's Malcolm?
You are.
OK.
Ma, he's a man.
I didn't know you moved in with a man.
What difference does it make?
He's over 100 years old.
I'm not sure he knows I'm a woman.
I think Amos and Andy are on the wireless tonight.
What do you say we stay home and laugh our asses off?
Malcolm, I told you I'm going out with the girls tonight.
Yeah, you always were the ladies' man, Tommy.
Ma, are you happy here?
Sure.
I live in a palace.
I got a maid.
It's a dream come true.
Look, Ma, I want you to come home.
I miss you.
We all miss you.
Ma, we're your family and you belong with us.
Can I still hang out with my friends?
No.
Wrong answer.
Ma.
I'm not being arbitrary.
I am worried about you.
All your friends are in their 80s.
You're driving at night, sometimes in bad weather.
You go to restaurants and eat spicy food and you're sick for three days.
I'm sorry, Ma.
I just can't say yes.
Bye.
Ma.
Ma!
You must be Tommy's boy.
How's the team look this year?
Coming.
Miles, what are you doing here?
Rose, I want the truth.
There's something going on between you and Buzz.
Yes, Miles, there is something going on.
I'm just not sure what it is.
There's someone at the door, Rose.
Rose, aren't you going to answer the door?
Hi, cutie.
Hello.
Buzz, this is Miles.
Miles, Buzz.
So you're Buzz?
So you're Miles?
You're Buzz.
You're Miles.
Buzz.
Miles.
Rose.
Huh?
Rose, I'd like to have a few words with you alone.
I'm sure Buzz won't mind.
I'll wait out on the lanai, pumpkin.
So is this the end of the road for us, pumpkin?
Oh, Miles.
Can't you see I'm overwhelmed?
I'm confused.
I don't know what I'm doing anymore.
Fine.
Let me help make it easy for you.
Dump Buzz.
Miles, I know it's asking a lot, but I'm gonna need a little time to figure this out All right.
OK.
I understand.
It's just the thought of losing you, Rose.
It scares me.
I love you, dammit.
I want us to be together.
We should be together because we wanna be, not because I boxed you into a corner with an ultimatum.
You take all the time you need, Rose.
I'll be waiting.
Coast clear?
Yeah.
Buzz, I've been thinking.
Why don't we spend some time getting to know each other before we go rushing off to Europe?
I know all I need to know.
Oh, now, look.
If you need a little bit more time, why don't I go to Europe, do what I have to do and then I'll come back for you?
That's exactly what you told me 40 years ago.
You never came back.
Yeah, but you got married.
I figure we both made mistakes.
We're even.
I don't think I made a mistake.
I wouldn't trade in my time with Charlie for anything.
I'm glad I didn't wait for you then, Buzz.
And I'm not gonna wait for you this time either.
Well I guess I'd better get going.
All right, you!
Get your hands off my woman!
Don't hit me, don't hit me, don't hit me!
I'm in the arts.
Miles.
I'm not finished, Rose.
I take back what I said before.
I'm not gonna sit around eating my heart out while you date somebody else.
I want you to stop seeing Buzz.
Okey dokey.
Because if you don't I'm sorry, but what did you say?
I said okey dokey.
Okey Okey I can't believe it.
After all these years of being sensitive, I barge in here like some macho jerk, and I get exactly what I want.
Oh, Miles, I find this side of you very exciting.
Well, it's the jungle cat in me.
I'll try to keep it carefully hidden, of course.
Oh, my God.
Now she's with the other boyfriend.
It's like living with Cher.
Ma.
Sophia, you're here.
You have your suitcase.
Does that mean you're moving back?
I don't get it.
I'm gone a few days and the dumb one's in there acting like a slut, while the slut's in here being stupid.
Of course I'm back.
Ma, it's so good to have you home.
And I was wrong.
I have no right to tell you how to run your life or who your friends should be.
I mean, you're obviously doing something right.
You've made it to 83.
I guess it's just me trying to hold on to you.
No.
You were right, Dorothy.
I was with the wrong crowd.
By the way, if anyone asks, I was here last night.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Oh, Ma, come here.
I want you to taste this.
Well?
Wouldn't it be easier to put a pillow over my face while I sleep?
Just set the table.
I'm expecting Stan and his cousin any minute.
Oh, then this sauce is perfect.
Well, maybe just a drop more disinfectant.
There!
I'm done.
Boy, it sure took you a long time to spell "Welcome Magda".
I thought that'd be too boring.
So instead I decided to depict Magda's escape from Czechoslovakia.
But isn't that barbed wire?
Isn't it amazing what you can do with icing?
Gee, you made that pack of dogs look very realistic.
But Rose, the revolution in Czechoslovakia was a peaceful one.
Nobody was chased by a pack of dogs.
But they're good dogs, Rose.
You are not gonna believe this.
My sister Charmaine just called me.
I didn't think the two of you were speaking.
Well, we're not.
Then how did you know it was her on the other end of the line?
Rose, you're bringing down the curve for the whole country.
I just don't believe it.
She is coming to town to promote a novel she's just had published.
We're all invited to a book-signing party.
Why, I can't believe she ever read a book, much less wrote one.
They're here.
I just hope Magda is nothing like Stan.
What am I gonna do about my sister coming?
By the time she leaves Miami, she'll be more famous here than I am.
Honey, only if they close the Sheraton.
Dorothy?
Cousin Magda!
Such a beautiful home!
Who sleeps with government official?
That would be my friend Blanche.
Pleased to meet you, Magda.
Thank you.
And this is my mother, Sophia Petrillo.
So you're Stan's cousin.
Please don't hold it against me.
She's OK.
Sit down, sit down.
Tell me, where's Stan?
Is he parking the car?
I take taxi.
Stanley and I have disagreement.
Oh?
What about?
He saw himself as human being.
I disagreed.
The man is pig!
He charge me rent!
His own cousin.
I can believe that.
His rates are reasonable, but the way he nickels and dimes you on the extras No, you're right.
Stan is a lazy, disgusting, sorry excuse for a man.
Now I stay here with you.
On the other hand, I hear he's got cable.
But Dorothy, I have nowhere to go.
I am stranger in strange land.
Oh, don't send me to cheap motel.
You have to pay for ice, just like at Stanley's.
Would it be all right if she stayed with us?
A novel!
How did my sister publish a novel?
I think it's all right with Blanche if you stay here.
You can have my room, I'll sleep with Ma.
Good.
Now when I wake up in the middle of the night screaming I'll have a reason.
And you remember that time Big Daddy caught us skinny-dipping with those boys?
And you told him it was our Bible study group "just practicing baptizing".
It would've worked, too, if you hadn't come up screaming: "Hey, y'all, things look bigger underwater"!
Maybe it's my imagination, but we seem to be getting along.
I know!
You just seem so refined, and vivacious, and charming.
Boy, you've really changed.
Thank you, Blanche.
Now, don't forget.
I'm gonna see you later at the book signing.
Maybe I can get a copy of your book there.
Well, it just so happens Oh, is this it?
Vixen: Story of a Woman.
Ooh, catchy title!
Would you like me to sign it?
Oh, sure!
Oh, imagine!
An autographed copy.
Will this make it harder to exchange?
Just kidding.
"To my sister Blanche.
You have inspired me more than you will ever know.
Charmaine".
That is very sweet.
I guess we'll see each other at the book signing.
Oh, I meant to ask you.
By any chance, do you happen to know what happened to Big Daddy's pocket watch?
Virginia says you took it after the funeral.
That pocket watch meant so much to me.
Big Daddy promised that watch to me.
In writing?
It was in the will.
Is this the same will where he promised the summer house to Gopher from Love Boat?
No, this is the sober will.
All right, all right, you can have the watch.
It's in my room.
Oh, not now, I'm late.
Just bring it to the book signing, OK?
Well, bye, darling.
See you there.
Did Charmaine leave already?
Oh, Rose, honey, what am I gonna do?
After all these years of jealousy and malice we finally have a chance to be friends.
But now I've got to read her book.
Why, if it's a piece of junk I'll have to tell her, and that'll just kill her.
Well, look on the bright side.
It could be good.
I was looking on the bright side.
What a day.
What's the matter?
Where's Magda?
You mean Flora the Red Menace?
She's helping Rose unload the car.
Is something wrong?
I don't want to talk about it.
Magda is driving us crazy.
All she does is complain about how awful things are in America.
Everywhere we went, something bothered her.
We showed her the mall-- She said we live in a plastic society with no soul.
This was after I bought her Beef Sticks and spreadable cheese from Hickory Farms.
Rose, everywhere you look the rich take advantage of the poor.
How can you deny there are inequities in this society?
Well, sure there are inequities, but at least we treat everybody the same.
There must be something about this country you like.
I like Slurpees.
Like 'em?
That's your fifth in the last hour.
They taste so natural and fruitlike.
Oh, Blanche, I see you've started Charmaine's book.
How is it?
Honey, I don't know if I can get through it.
You mean it's not good?
Oh, it's awful!
This book is totally unbelievable.
The heroine, Vixen St. James, is this shallow southern belle who's vain, self-centered, and a pushover for any man that crosses her path.
Yeah, she's right.
That is unbelievable.
Oh.
Oh Oh!
Ow!
You drank the Slurpee too fast again, didn't you?
It's like knife sticking in forehead.
The pain, it is it is really good!
These Slurpees are best thing about America.
Magda, how can you be such an expert on America when you've only been here a few days?
I know that Communist system is more fair.
How can you say that?
People all over the world are realizing that Communism doesn't work.
It worked for me.
I had automatic can opener, I had toaster, and I was very near top of list to get electricity.
For me, things were good.
Yeah, but if things were good for you and bad for everyone else, how is that fair?
Comrade?
Don't tell me about Communism.
I know what I know.
I am a Communist.
This is terrible!
I was raised to hate Communists.
I remember in the early '50s when McCarthy came to St. Olaf to speak in the town square.
I was never so moved by a public speaker.
Although some people thought he was a puppet for the right wing.
No, wait.
That was Charlie McCarthy.
I'd have put money on that.
But still, St. Olaf's town motto was "Better Ned than red".
Ned was sort of the town idiot.
When?
On your days off?
What do you want me to do?
Throw her out?
Yes.
And while you're at it, ditch the Commie.
I don't believe this.
I just don't believe it.
What's the matter?
Listen to this.
"Vixen stared at herself in the mirror, "her pouty lips, her flaxen hair, "her flawless alabaster skin.
"Her proud breasts seemed to be saying, 'Is it just me or is it cold in here?
'" So?
Pouty, flaxen, proud?
What do you need?
A photograph?
This book is about me!
I don't see Blanche.
She said she'd be over right after her hair appointment.
She wanted to look her best for Charmaine's big day.
Well, Blanche is handling this a lot better than I would.
I would kill Gloria if she ever wrote about my sexual escapades.
You'd kill your sister over a pamphlet?
So many books!
I know.
This is a book store.
If you need me, I'll be in the Bitter Children of Celebrities section.
Don't get lost.
Too many books.
Too many contradictory opinions next to each other.
This leads to anarchy.
These books represent different ideas.
What's going to happen now there is freedom?
The people in my country are going to read all these books and be confused.
No, the way things were, we knew what to do.
The choices were easy.
When there is one road, no one gets lost.
Not necessarily.
Back in St. Olaf, there-- Rose.
Is this a story about getting lost?
Uh-huh.
Well, don't tell us.
Show us.
Magda, there are two books I want you to read.
The first one is Thomas Paine's Common Sense.
I think it'll give you some idea of what freedom is all about.
And the second is Vanna White's autobiography.
Why should I read this?
It's just a hell of a book.
Ma.
Ma, I don't know how much more of Magda I can stand.
We're so close to the Bermuda Triangle, it'd be a shame for her not to see it.
You know, you really can't blame Magda.
It's all this Communist ideology that's been pumped into her.
I hate Communism.
Of course you hate Communism, Ma.
It's because you were raised a Fascist.
Blanche, where have you been?
Blanche?
Blanche?
Blanche!
Oh, you look just beautiful.
Thank you for coming.
Darling, I wouldn't miss this for the world.
Did you get a chance to read any of the book?
Every word.
Well, what did you think?
I should've known I couldn't trust you.
That all that "let's be sisters" stuff was just a bunch of bull.
You had no right to use my life for your book.
To twist facts so that beautiful, sacred love became so much tawdry trash.
I earned that A in history!
For the first time in my life, I'm ashamed to be a Hollingsworth.
Vixen: Story of a Woman is nothing but a vulgar collection of perverse sexual acts that are sheer and utter filth!
Hello?
Oh, just a minute.
Blanche, it's for you.
It's Charmaine again.
OK.
Blanche, don't you think you should talk to her?
She's still your sister.
No.
My sister has turned into a deceitful old woman whose only pleasure is in hurting people.
No offense, Sophia.
None taken.
Slut.
What really gets me is I was willing to be friends.
But just as I start to forgive and forget, Charmaine turns my life into a bestseller.
You know something, Blanche?
You're not the only one who ever had a problem with sisters.
When I was a kid, I had a doll named Mrs. Doolittle.
And Gloria was not supposed to-- Do we have to listen to that damn Mrs. Doolittle story again?
So your sister broke your doll.
It was 50 years ago.
It was very traumatic.
She was my favorite doll.
I didn't talk to Gloria for months.
But eventually, Blanche, I realized sisters are harder to replace than dolls.
So we made up, and I vowed right then and there never ever to fight over something so childish and silly again.
My favorite!
I have a sister story I think you'll find interesting.
She didn't just break it, she made it so the eyes would never close again.
She made Mrs. Doolittle look like a morphine addict!
There was a time in my life when I wanted to leave St. Olaf.
I just didn't feel it was big enough for me.
I had my eye on the Great White Way.
So I went to St. Gustav, the city that never naps.
That first night I walked around in amazement.
They had their own Fotomat!
Of course, it wasn't as large as the Fotomats you see today.
Now, here's the scary part.
Suddenly, I realized I was this frightened little girl alone in the big city.
Accident, my foot!
It started to rain, and I stood there in the middle of the town square and cried.
Gloria was the one who had to get the rabies shot.
I was a biter.
There I was, drenched, and someone yelled out: "Hey!
Don't you have enough sense to come in out of the rain"?
Well, then it hit me.
And when I went home to St. Olaf, I passed on this bit of street-smart savvy.
The next thing you know, in St. Olaf the in thing was coming in out of the rain.
I was the town celebrity.
Until the phrase "Watch out for that tractor" caught on.
What in hell does this have to do with sisters?
Didn't I mention?
St. Olaf and St. Gustav were sister cities.
And how did Mrs. Doolittle's hair get singed?
Did it herself?
I think not.
Now, I had very bad fight with my sister once.
Oh, really?
Tell us about it.
I turned her over to secret police.
And?
And what?
I turned her over to secret police.
No more to tell.
When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie That's amore When the world seems to shine like you've had too much wine That's amore Ma, that's lovely.
What?
Your singing.
That was me?
I was gonna ask you to turn off the radio.
Ladies, ladies, I have very bad news.
I must shorten my stay, Dorothy.
In fact, I'm leaving tomorrow.
Dorothy, move the coffee table.
I wanna do a cartwheel.
I must return to Czechoslovakia immediately because of something very valuable I learned here.
You finally understood what I was saying in the book store.
No, no.
It was story Rose told last night in kitchen about going to St. Gustav, learning to come in out of the rain-- My very favorite doll.
Dorothy, let it go.
Anyway, that trip changed her life.
Now I must have courage to change mine.
I'm going back with what I learned here.
It didn't change my life, I just went home.
Shut up, she's leaving.
See, I left Czechoslovakia because I was afraid of change, afraid of the new freedom.
But now I see in America freedom is change.
Always changing for the better idea.
I want to be part of the future of my country.
So I'm going home.
And you got that part from my story?
No, Vanna White's book.
I told you.
Anyway, now I must go pack my things.
And again, Rose, thank you for story.
You know, isn't life funny?
Last night in bed I told myself: "Nobody listens to your stories, Rose, quit telling them".
And I swore I would never tell another story as long as I lived.
And then you hear something like this, and you realize these stories make a difference.
Oh!
You know, something sort of like that happened to Hans Fliegelfleister.
I hope it's Death.
Get it, Rose.
Okey-dokey.
Charmaine!
Blanche, look who's here.
It's Charmaine.
Oh, good.
Ringside seats.
What do you want?
Among other things, your apology.
Well, unless I missed a newsflash, hell did not freeze over today.
Anything else?
Yes.
Big Daddy's pocket watch.
That watch is a family heirloom.
As far as I'm concerned you're no longer family.
I believe you said it was in your room.
Which room is that?
Turnstile at the end of the hall.
So, anyway, Hans Fliegelfleister Get out of my room!
Not till I find that watch.
Now, where is it?
I'll never tell.
Unlike you, who tells everything.
You had no right to use me, to rip off my life for profit.
I wish my bank account was as big as your ego.
Now, you listen, and you listen good.
My book is based on my life.
Oh, that book just drips Blanche Devereaux.
Only the names have been changed to protect the satisfied.
You think you're the only one who wakes up to smiles and roses?
Well, how about that inscription?
How I'd inspired you more than I'll ever know?
Oh, I write the same thing to everybody.
Just like signing yearbooks, remember?
You always wrote the same thing.
"You were the first".
Wrote it, hell.
I had a stamp made.
Oh, I guess I've just been a fool.
Blanche, we're an awful lot alike.
Too much alike.
It's probably why we never got along.
That also might be the reason why you thought the book was about you.
My God, you're right.
Oh, uh Except for that part where Vixen is terrified of losing her looks and growing old alone.
I have never felt like that.
Course!
Me neither.
That's what makes it fiction.
You remember the other day when you said you thought it was time that we were friends again?
I believe I'm ready to try.
Oh!
Oh, Blanche!
Come on, I'll make you a big cup of coffee.
Oh, darling, I smudged your makeup.
Oh, I messed up your hair.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Morning.
Morning, honey.
I had the strangest dream last night.
I was at a baseball game.
Charlie Brown was pitching and Schroeder was behind the plate.
And Lucy and Snoopy were in the outfield and they wouldn't let me play.
When I woke up I was crying.
What do you suppose it all means?
Peanuts envy?
Good morning.
Hey, you got home pretty late last night.
When I went to bed you still weren't in.
I was up all night with Mel Bushman, having one of our "where is this relationship going"?
talks.
And where is it going?
Where it usually goes - room 506 at the Quality Court.
Oh, I hate him.
God, if only he didn't wanna talk.
Oh, by the way, right after I got in, you got a phone call.
Oh From a Glen somebody.
Glen O'Brien?
Uh-huh.
Did he leave a number?
Who's Glen O'Brien?
He's the married guy she shacked up with four years ago.
Look, I'm not proud of what I did, but it didn't seem so bad at the time.
He was trapped in a bad marriage.
There's no such thing as being trapped in a marriage.
In this country you can get divorced.
In Sicily there was no divorce.
If you wanted to end a marriage, you had to resort to the lupara.
Is that some kind of legal loophole?
It's some kind of sawed-off shotgun.
Blanche, did he leave a number?
No.
Dorothy, dropping him was the smartest thing you did.
What are you gonna do if he calls again?
Don't talk to him!
Why not?
Four years is a long time.
Maybe he's divorced.
Do you think?
Sure.
Why else would he call?
Stay away from him.
See him.
Keep some self-respect.
Self-respect is for losers like Rose.
Well, sure.
You'd have some great times and some fabulous sex, but is that worth your self-respect?
Not now, loser.
Hello.
Oh, look.
I'm sorry, I'm going to have to interrupt.
I'm sure this is a very worthy cause, but to be perfectly frank, at this moment, I couldn't give a flying fig about whooping cranes.
No, I have to keep the line free.
Fine.
I'll send you a check.
Hold it, let me grab a pencil.
OK.
Whooping Cranes Box 1990, Newcastle, Louisiana, got it.
Glad I could help.
Bye-bye.
Blanche is taking me to the mall.
Wanna come?
I don't think so.
You're not teaching today.
It'll be fun.
No, I think I'd just rather sit here and read.
Hello.
Oh, hi.
Yes, I heard you called.
What a pleasant surprise.
Well I'm pretty sure I can make it.
Just let me check my book.
I seem to be clear.
He must have asked her out this century.
Where?
Fine.
Fine, all right.
Bye-bye.
What did he say?
He said he had something important to talk about.
Oh, that's my favorite lie.
Dorothy, you'll be sorry.
Ma, come on.
We liked each other.
He's a funny, warm, giving man.
He made me laugh.
I am seeing him.
All right.
Go ahead, meet your adulterer, but remember you were brought up a lady.
Keep both your feet on the floor.
I'd go better change.
Blanche, what should I wear?
If you're gonna keep both feet on the floor something you can pull off over your head.
I don't care what that salesgirl said.
I looked good in that bathing suit.
You know, sometimes I wish I did live in Brazil.
Excuse me, did one of you ladies drop this?
Is there any money in it?
Uh-huh.
I dropped it.
Sophia, you did nothing of the kind.
A lot of money in here.
That does look a little bit like Sophia's wallet.
It's a man's wallet.
Did either of you see who did drop it?
Afraid not, no.
There's over $2,000 in here.
Whoever lost this must be found.
We should turn it in to lost and found.
Wait a minute!
You're gonna give that money to a guy who makes two bucks an hour watching umbrellas?
That's a good point.
Besides, there's no ID in here.
What if we put a notice in the newspaper?
After a certain amount of time, if nobody claimed the wallet, then we could-- Split it.
Then we could split it.
I know that is what I would want people to do if I lost my wallet.
Sure.
Hold it.
Who's gonna keep the money?
I don't know you well enough to trust you.
And her I know.
So we got a problem.
This is off-the-top-of-my-head stuff, but maybe we're too close to the problem.
Maybe we should ask somebody who doesn't have a stake in this.
Maybe they could find a solution.
Dumb idea?
It's worth a try.
How about that nun over there?
What if she guilts us into giving it to charity?
I think we can agree that that's the last thing we wanna do.
On the other hand, she is a shopping nun.
She could be OK.
Excuse me.
Sister.
Yes.
These ladies and I found a wallet with money in it.
But until the rightful owner shows up to claim it, we were wondering where we could put it so it'd be safe.
In a bank?
But whose bank?
Couldn't you open a joint account in all your names?
I don't know.
See, I really don't know these people.
Well, maybe you could both put up equal amounts of your own money to show mutual good faith and open up an account.
If the money isn't claimed, you could withdraw it and split it.
If it is, at least you've made some interest.
Oh, that sounds too complicated.
I think it would work.
I'd certainly be willing to put up $2,000 of my money if you two would put up $1,000 each.
Thank you so much for your help, sister.
Go with God.
Sophia, I just don't know.
Come on.
Dorothy's bank is right over there.
She lets me draw on her account.
If he's honest enough to put up his money, we should be willing to do the same.
I guess it seems fair.
OK.
Great.
Let's go.
Sophia.
Remember, found money is supposed to be spent on something frivolous, something you would never buy for yourself.
What are you gonna get?
Underwear?
Dorothy.
Hi.
You look very pretty.
So do you.
Come in.
Nice place.
Yeah, well I was left a little strapped by the settlement.
Can I get you something to drink?
Settlement?
The divorce settlement.
I got to keep half my self-respect and she got to keep everything else.
Anyway, that's why I had to talk to you.
I had to find out how you were doing.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
I'm doing just fine.
Maybe I will have just a glass of water.
Gee, it seems so strange not meeting you in a hotel room.
I guess I shouldn't steal the towels.
Ooh, towels.
Yeah, I gotta put that on my shopping list.
Right next to "soap" and "broad with job".
I've missed you, Dorothy.
Good water.
I'm having a little trouble getting used to the idea that you're divorced, because I remember you told me that no matter how bad the marriage was, you felt that you were too old to just leave it for an uncertain future.
Kidding.
No.
Actually, I didn't have any choice in the matter.
She divorced me.
What happened?
She found you with someone else?
No.
She found herself with someone else.
I can't say that I blame her.
I mean, there was really nothing left between us.
Since things are different now, do you think there's any chance we could start over?
I don't know.
I mean, you know, four years.
Is there someone else?
No.
No, there's no one else.
Good.
You know what's interesting?
I just read somewhere that the cells in the human body completely regenerate themselves every seven years.
Isn't that interesting?
Uh-huh.
I I guess that means that we're 40% of who we were, you know, four years ago.
Dorothy.
Yes.
Actually, it's four and a half years, so that makes it closer to 35%.
You know what?
The last thing my mother said to me was that she wanted me to keep my feet on the floor.
My mother wanted me to be a priest.
I guess it's a bad day for mothers.
Rose.
Hi, how did shopping go?
Great.
Great.
It was great.
Really great.
Best shopping ever.
I was just gonna make some lemonade.
I bet you girls could really use some.
Great.
Okey-dokey.
Sophia, remember, we swore we don't tell anybody.
Not even Dorothy?
It was her money.
Nobody.
I just couldn't stand the humiliation.
You want the world to know that a perfect stranger tricked us out of $2,000?
OK, OK.
I won't tell anybody.
You don't have to worry about me, Blanche.
No one will get a word out of me.
I swear on my uncle Guido's grave.
Then the guy gave us the envelope with his money, our money, and the found money in it.
Blanche and I went to open the joint account and when the teller opened the envelope, there were just scraps of paper in it.
I don't remember any more.
That's all you're gonna get from me, no matter how many times you hit me.
Sophia, what about your uncle Guido?
He's fine.
I got a postcard from him this morning.
You two were victims of the oldest confidence game going - the pigeon drop.
But he just seemed so honest.
Well, that's why it's called a confidence game.
He has to win your confidence or you wouldn't put up the money.
It wasn't his idea.
The nun suggested it.
She was part of the team.
They always work in pairs.
I don't know what the church is coming to.
I thought it stopped with bingo.
That was no nun.
I work for a consumer protection show.
We've been warning people about this for months.
Once these scamsters have your money in an envelope, they make a switch and you wind up with worthless paper.
They prey on the old and the gullible.
Are you calling me gullible?
No.
There is one thing I think you should both do right away - inform the police.
Oh, forget it.
The reason these confidence men don't get caught is because people are embarrassed to come forward and admit they were conned.
I'm sorry, Rose.
I just can't.
Well, perhaps this little story might make you change your mind.
Back in St. Olaf there was a shepherd boy who tended his flock on the hill above the town.
A wolf kept coming down and stealing his sheep, but the boy never caught him doing it.
Because he never saw it happening, he became known around St. Olaf as the boy who didn't cry wolf.
Anyway, one day the townspeople heard the boy on the hill yelling, "Wolf, Wolf".
Well, they all figured, if the boy never cried wolf when the wolf was there, if he yelled wolf now, it stood to reason the wolf wasn't there.
Boy, nothing gets by you people.
Damn straight.
It was a bear.
A huge, ferocious, grizzly bear.
What happened to the boy?
He became known as the boy who cried continuously.
I just got off the phone with Sergeant Delfino of the bunko squad.
They picked up two people who matched the description we gave 'em.
They want us to come down tomorrow and pick out nuns from a lineup.
That must make you feel proud.
That's what Sergeant Delfino said.
"Why, you must feel proud knowing that by having come forth as you have, you have possibly saved other oldsters from a similar rip-off".
He called me an oldster.
I called him a pig.
We're having dinner on Saturday.
I really appreciate this - your meeting my mother.
Hey, you wanna get married?
Instead of meeting my mother?
No.
We can do both.
It's kind of sudden.
Think about it.
I will.
I mean, this is something to think about.
OK, let's go.
Oh, God, this is gonna be awful.
I'm looking forward to this.
You meet the mother, it gives you a pretty good idea what the daughter's gonna look like in 30 years.
Only if you lock me in the drier.
Everybody, this is Glen.
Glen, I'd like you to meet-- Don't tell me.
Rose, Blanche and Mrs. Petrillo.
These are for you.
Cannoli?
What does an Irishman know about cannoli?
When I was a kid in Brooklyn, every Sunday, my father used to go to Zampano's bakery for cannoli.
I never dreamed you grew up in Brooklyn.
Oh, sure.
Our whole block was Irish.
The other block was Italian.
We used to take turns beating each other up on the way home from school.
I think it's nice when kids take turns.
Blanche, could I see you in the kitchen for a minute?
Oh, sure.
I'll be right back, Glen.
I think you'll be OK.
So, Glen.
How come you cheated on your wife?
Wow.
Straight to Final Jeopardy, huh?
OK.
Bernice and I had been separated emotionally for years when I met Dorothy, and right or wrong, I've never been anything but grateful that that happened.
What else you wanna know about me?
Sophia, I think it's time you stopped subjecting this nice man to the third degree.
I had to check him out.
Dorothy's a smart, attractive girl, but when it comes to picking men, she's all thumbs.
But she's clean and she's got good teeth.
Cannoli?
I had to tell somebody and I couldn't wait another minute.
Glen asked me to marry him.
Pay dirt!
Well, are you gonna do it?
I haven't had time to make up my mind.
Don't dawdle.
Men have a very short memory span when it comes to that question.
Sometimes they forget before you can get your clothes back on.
Dorothy, Glen is such a charmer.
He and Sophia are really getting along.
Can I tell her?
Glen asked Dorothy to marry him.
Do it.
Oh, marry him, Dorothy.
Even if you have to sign one of those prenatal agreements.
Oh, I'm so happy.
Am I too happy?
Why am I so happy?
Is this too good to be true?
You are such a pessimist, always looking on the dark side.
A fine pessimist I'd be if I didn't.
Oh, girls.
Group hug.
Ma, what are you doing up?
Just having a Maalox moment.
What about you?
Thinking about Glen.
This whole thing is so rushed.
Ma, I'm afraid.
I'm too old to make another mistake.
I don't wanna make a fool out of myself.
Pussycat, you're never too old to make a fool of yourself.
Those were your exact words when I told you I lost that money and you were right.
I never felt so stupid.
Of course, I would have felt more stupid if it had been my money instead of yours.
Ma, what do you think I should do?
No one can help you with that decision, Dorothy.
I can't tell you what to do.
I mean, I won't be around forever.
I'd like to know there was someone here to love you and take care of you like you take care of me.
Maybe he could give you a bigger allowance.
It's nice to buy something that's not generic.
You know what I'm saying, Dorothy?
Yes, Ma.
And it's nice, you saying you love me and you care.
No.
I'm saying buy genuine Q-Tips.
If I'm gonna put a stick in my ear, I'd like a little cotton at the end.
Remind me before you leave I went back to the bakery and got your mother some anis cookies.
You don't have to try so hard.
To be honest, I still can't believe how much my mother liked you.
I liked her too.
One thing puzzled me though.
When you were all in the kitchen, why did she keep asking me if I'd lost this wallet with 50 bucks in it?
My mom, the eternal girl scout.
You were very quiet on the way over.
You gave me a lot to think about.
Oh, come on.
You had to see it coming.
I just didn't expect it so soon.
So what do you say?
Marry me and take me away from all this.
Excuse me.
Hello.
Oh, hello, Bernice.
No, I'm alone.
Well, what do you want?
Yeah, sure.
I'll sign 'em tomorrow.
OK.
Bye.
"I'm alone"?
It's gonna take a while for everybody to get used to this.
So what do you say?
Will you marry me?
I wanna get my life together.
I'm really no good being single.
Just look around.
I am looking and listening, and I can't help but remember that I've been in the room before when your wife called and you said you were alone.
Then you were cheating on her.
With you.
Yes.
But I've also been Bernice and have my husband call me and he was always alone too.
I was married to Stanley for 38 years and for approximately he cheated on me.
I told a little lie because it's gonna take her some time to get used to the idea of you and me.
Well, I'm going to need a little time to get used to it too.
Look, I'm I'm not saying you're a cheat or I'm not saying that you're like Stan.
I don't know.
Maybe there's something wrong with me.
That I'm not trusting enough but I'm gonna need some time.
So what are you telling me?
It's gonna be months or years?
Or maybe never?
Dorothy, if we were both 25, I could wait but I need someone in my life now.
Are you sure that you wanna marry me or are you just afraid to be alone?
Who wants to be alone?
Nobody.
I don't.
But if you're marrying me because I happen to be on the top of the list, then maybe I shouldn't be on the list.
So I guess this is it, huh?
I guess so.
I still love you, Dorothy.
I love you too.
If you change your mind-- If you change yours.
There's no reason why my mother shouldn't have the cookies.
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Morning, Dorothy.
I didn't want to hear it from Bryant Gumbel, and I don't want to hear it from you.
Problem?
I still don't have a date for Jenny's wedding.
My own goddaughter, and I'm gonna show up alone.
How humiliating!
Ma, don't rub it in.
I meant for me.
I called every guy I know, and they all came up with the same lame excuse.
What?
"I don't want to go".
Good morning!
Dorothy, do you have a date yet?
I don't want to go.
Dorothy.
I'll get you a date.
You can borrow one of my extras.
What kind of guy would you like?
She's not picky.
Yes, I am.
Right.
You could circle the globe without finding another Stan.
Look, why do you care if I have a date?
Family honor.
Especially at this wedding.
What's so special about this wedding?
Dorothy's goddaughter is marrying the grandson of Giuseppe Mangiacavallo.
So?
Let her tell the story.
When I was 14 in Sicily, my father arranged a marriage with a neighbor's son.
My dowry was two chickens, a ladle and a goat to be named later.
We came from a wealthy family.
But the day of my wedding, as I stood at the altar, the boy I was to marry was on a cattle boat headed for America.
That night, on a tear-stained pillow, I put a curse on him.
A curse?
Nothing fancy.
I remember I said, "Giuseppe Mangiacavallo, from this day forward, "may you and all your future generations "never know true love.
"May you be sterile, and may all your offspring be sterile.
"May your hair never lie flat, and may your socks always slip down inside your shoes".
And this is the same Giuseppe Mangiacavallo who is the grandfather of the groom?
Now you see why I want us to look good at this wedding.
Look, Ma, I don't know how to break this to you Gently.
I'm old.
Giuseppe Mangiacavallo has had a fabulous life.
He's in his 80s, he's a multimillionaire, and enjoys perfect health.
Well, it's a very slow-acting curse.
So it would appear.
That's the beauty of it.
He's been lulled into a false sense of security for the past 70 years, so I don't want you showing up like a wallflower and blowing my big moment.
Sophia's right.
Oh, Dorothy, come on.
Borrow one of my men.
One of my many, many, many, many, many, many men!
All right.
All right.
For Ma's sake.
Let's see.
You're going with Howard Dr. Howard.
How about Doug?
Oh, Dorothy, not Doug!
I couldn't possibly.
He's on my A-list.
I mean, come on, Dorothy.
He's a judge.
He's fun to be with, and I haven't paid a speeding ticket in six months.
You know, this is why I hate doing this.
You always do this, Blanche.
You always keep all the good guys for yourself and you give us the leftovers.
You know what your trouble is?
Of course not.
You're only generous when it doesn't mean anything.
But you won't give if it's going to hurt.
Hey, Dorothy, you could always call Claude Hughes.
Oh, come on, Ma.
Claude Hughes is the dullest, ugliest man I know.
So what's the problem?
He didn't want to go.
Uh, Ma, now that you've finished, could I see that?
Next time I'll ask you to hand me the candlestick.
Look, Ma, it's not so terrible if I go to the wedding alone.
Hi, Rose.
It's not fair.
I don't deserve these kinds of problems.
Oh, honey.
Maybe I can help.
I live to help.
I'm a great friend.
Contrary to popular belief.
Miles can't take me to the wedding.
He's going to be out of town at a teaching seminar.
Now I can't go.
That shouldn't keep you from going.
Oh, I have my reasons.
It's a long story.
Gotta run.
Now, what's this all about?
Well, it started Oh, my God.
at my wedding in St. Olaf's Great Shepherd Church.
Oh, it was beautiful.
Especially when all those balloons dropped from the ceiling.
You had balloons in the church?
Well, it's not as if we filled them with air.
We learned our lesson.
You put air in them, and the St. Olaf Boys' Choir would use them to make those disgusting noises.
Go on with your story, darling.
I care deeply.
Well, after the wedding, Charlie and I had the most exciting, passionate night of our lives.
After that, whenever we'd go to a wedding, we'd end up going home and putting on the cast album of Song of Norway, and going crazy on each other!
What are you saying, Rose?
Weddings get you hot?
Yes.
I mean, it was fine while Charlie was alive, but oh, I'll never forget that first wedding after he died.
So now you see why I can't go if Miles is gonna be out of town.
I might end up almost going to bed with the caterer again.
Rose, I want to help, but first you have to tell me what the problem is.
Oh, Rose, honey, you have nothing to worry about.
We wouldn't let you do something you'd regret.
That's what I was gonna say, I swear.
You're such good friends.
You hear that, Dorothy?
You're trying too hard, Blanche.
Well, you hurt me with what you said.
Oh, Dorothy, let me get you somebody hot off my A-list.
Somebody tall, good-looking, goes with everything.
Doug?
How about an ex-racecar driver?
Speaks five languages, has three car dealerships.
Has a slight limp, so he can only dance in a circle, but that works at a wedding.
Doug.
I got an anesthesiologist, but you won't feel anything.
Doug.
All right, Doug.
But listen.
Don't you forget, you be careful.
This man is on loan from the Blanche Devereaux collection.
Oh, what a beautiful wedding.
And, Ma, nothing went wrong.
A curse doesn't work in a church.
Too many statues.
Give it time.
Is it just me, or did anybody else notice the buns on that priest?
Rose, honey, take it easy.
Breathe deeply.
It'll be all right.
Don't worry, honey.
Nothing to worry about.
We're here to look out for you.
Oh, I just hope the band doesn't play the St. Olaf Wedding March.
I think the chances of their playing that are pretty slim.
I don't know.
It got awfully popular after Laurel and Hardy started using it as their theme song.
We're gonna have to keep an eye on her.
Mm.
Dorothy, I'm gonna find Mangiacavallo.
I want him to see the tasty little morsel he let slip through his fingers.
Where's Doug?
Oh, he's checking our coats.
Blanche, I want to thank you.
You know, he's really a very nice guy.
Well, that's fine for you, but I don't know why I even came.
This is the last time I ever date a doctor.
Imagine dumping me for an emergency appendectomy!
I just hate it when doctors use the Hippocratic oath as an excuse for everything.
Blanche, it was his appendix.
Sorry that took so long, Dorothy.
Shall we sit down?
Yes, let's.
Sophia!
After all this time.
I was hoping you'd come.
I wouldn't have missed it.
You still got those beautiful eyes that light up a room.
I had cataracts.
Very becoming.
OK, OK, enough chit-chat.
I fixed it so all this will come crashing down on your head.
What are you talking about?
I'm finally gonna get my revenge.
I put a curse on you.
There are no curses, Sophia!
That's a thousand miles and a hundred years ago.
Sophia put a curse on me!
Dorothy looks very happy, doesn't she, Sophia?
You really came through, Blanche.
I feel all warm inside.
This must be what they call the joy of giving.
Feels a lot like cramps.
Cocktail wiener?
Aren't you nice?
Do you like jazz?
No, ma'am.
I've always felt there was something about a man with a tray Is it warm in here?
Would you just look at them?
They look good together, don't they?
Well, I don't think so.
I think Dorothy's falling for him.
Little Miss Hard-To-Get has been letting him lead.
I'm gonna go find the men's room.
Oh, it's right down the hall on your right.
Blanche, I want to thank you.
I am really having a good time.
You know, Dorothy, there is a thin line between having a good time and becoming an obvious wanton slut.
I know.
My toe's been on that line.
Sophia, I was hoping we could dance.
Don't try to kissy up.
It's too late.
The blight is coming.
A plague on both your houses.
Actually, I have four houses and a summer home.
Come on, Ma, calm down.
There's no curse.
Nothing's gonna happen.
How could you do that to me?
Why are you making such a thing?
Leave me alone!
I hate you!
Uh, just a little lover's quarrel.
Please go on with the party.
I better see what's wrong.
Care to dance?
Love to.
Can you believe that?
Was that worth waiting I love it!
The Mangiacavallo curse is finally kicking in.
Vengeance is mine!
Do you think they'll let us take home the centerpieces?
Can you believe it?
She's been dancing with him for the last half hour!
Don't let it get to you, pussycat.
Oh, thanks, Ma.
All your whining is lousing up the happiest day of my life!
Excuse me.
Yes?
I couldn't help noticing.
How do you make your eyes twirl around like that?
It's not hard.
I just try to think of two things at once.
Well, it's very attractive.
Have you always been able to do it?
No.
Only at weddings.
Excuse me.
Look at the way Blanche is nuzzling up to him!
Look, I'm not gonna take this lying down.
I don't think you're gonna be invited.
If you'll excuse me, I just want to fix my face.
Oh, I don't know whether you've noticed, but women usually do this in pairs.
Sophia.
Am I the only one who feels like ripping her clothes off and doing the hokey-pokey?
No, Rose.
I think they're just waiting for someone to get them started.
All right, Blanche.
What are you doing?
Just trying to make myself even more attractive.
Pointless, isn't it?
I mean, what are you doing with Doug?
He is here with me.
Well, I know that.
I'm the one who set it up in the first place, Dorothy.
By the way, he said some very nice things about you.
I said you were gonna do this.
I knew you were gonna do this, and now you have done it.
Dorothy, you are starting to upset me.
Do you want to ruin my whole evening?
After all, it's your fault.
How is it my fault?
Well, if you'd let me get you somebody on my B-list, I never would have been so attracted to him.
No tissues.
Listen, Blanche, we have to talk.
Not now, Dorothy.
Suit yourself.
Dorothy, will you let me out of here?
No way, Blanche.
Oh!
Well, you can't do this.
It's a violation of my civil rights.
You have the time, you have the paper.
Why don't you sit down and write a long letter to your senator?
I have a steady boyfriend, and he's out of town, so unfortunately I'm not available.
Unless, of course, you like jazz.
Well, I've got Dizzy Gillespie back at my place.
Does he like jazz?
Why don't we find out?
Okey-dokey, daddio.
Sophia.
You still alive?
Sophia, please.
Joey's alone in the bridal suite, the bride is who knows where, and the band doesn't even know "Volare".
You've got to do something about the curse, Sophia.
Oh, so now you believe?
I guess you can't get away from your roots.
Why should I do this for you?
First you left me at the altar, you shamed me, you shamed my father.
You left me with a sullied reputation.
But we didn't do anything.
Well, how do you think that made me look?
I was a kid.
I was scared that if I got married and had a family, I never would get out of that village.
Leaving you was the toughest thing that I ever did.
Yeah.
I was quite a dish back then.
Longest legs of any girl in the village.
Dorothy, let me out of here right now!
There's only one way out, Blanche, and I don't think you can hold your breath long enough.
You're just making a mountain out of a molehill.
Five years of molehills.
They add up.
I didn't know Doug meant this much to you.
I'm not talking about Doug, this is about you.
She asked me for another chance, I gave it to her.
I trusted her.
Biggest mistake I ever made.
You're right, Aunt Dorothy, you can't trust people.
Joey just told me about some of the things that went on at his bachelor party.
Bachelor parties can be fun.
Aunt Blanche?
Darling, you look lovely.
Get help!
What you said about not trusting people made all the sense in the world.
I should go tell Joey the same thing.
Honey, it may not be the same thing.
Joey didn't lie to you.
He told you the truth.
I guess.
Sounds to me like you two just had a little misunderstanding.
Not five years of deliberate betrayal of trust!
Dorothy, you do that one more time, I'm gonna write on this wall, "For a good time, call Dorothy Zbornak".
Blanche, this is the ladies' room.
Right!
Jen, honey, I think you should go and talk to Joey.
The best thing to do in any relationship is talk.
That's right I have nothing to say to you.
Sophia, I can't believe that saying this will right 70 years of being wrong.
Just say it.
It'll make me feel better.
Sophia, I can't.
Do it.
Uh, everyone?
May I have your attention, please?
This is Sophia Petrillo, the girl who stood me up at the altar 70 years ago.
And?
And I just asked her to be my wife again, and again she said no.
Go on.
And so, from now on I'm gay.
OK.
We're even.
Now let's go take care of the kids.
Ma, have you seen Rose?
She left with Doug.
Boy, were her eyes twirling!
How could she do this to me?
Uh, you.
Who did she do this to?
What's happening?
Oh, Blanche, don't you see?
We were supposed to look after her.
We knew that she gets hot at weddings.
She was counting on us.
You don't look after me when I get hot.
That's because I also have a day job.
Here's the bridal suite.
I'll bless you in my prayers for this, Sophia.
I might as well give them the chance we never got.
Uh, this could take a while.
And it won't be pretty.
Did you ever see The Exorcist?
No.
Good movie.
Well, here goes.
Oh, sorry, kids.
Don't stop on my account.
Curse is over.
Dorothy, I wish you'd talk to me.
I really do, 'cause what I need is a good talking-to.
I don't care what you say, just so long as you care enough to say it.
You stink.
God bless you, Dorothy.
I don't want to talk about it.
I'm too worried about Rose.
I guess we weren't very good friends to her, were we?
No, we weren't.
Oh, I hope she can forgive us.
She will.
That's what she does best.
You know, Blanche, I owe you an apology.
How can I be high and mighty about my friendship with you when I can't do Rose the simple favor of keeping her out of trouble?
What I have to do is remember you for the person you are, and accept you for that.
I'm sorry, Dorothy, what did you say?
I thought I had established eye contact with one of the guys in the rhythm section.
Well, hello again.
Where's Rose?
You know, I don't know what happened.
We got in the car, we were going to my place Well, she wanted to go to my place, and then she didn't want to go to my place, and next thing I know we were headed for the airport.
Oh, that is low!
Not only do you take advantage of her, but you take her to the one area in town that has the cheapest motel rates.
Blanche, I took her to the airport so she could catch a plane to be with this guy Miles.
He must really be something.
So is Rose.
So, either of you ladies care to dance?
Doug!
You left here with another woman.
You were going to take her to your place.
Now you come back here and ask us if we still want to dance?
How can you do that?
It's still early.
Remember that restaurant in Sicily we used to go to on Sundays?
I'd save up all week for one plate of pasta that we'd share.
The checkered tablecloths, the candle in the Chianti bottle, bad paintings of the Colosseum.
You remember!
No, but the odds were in my favor.
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Oh, there it is.
Ma, what are you doing with my rÃ©sumÃ©?
Punching it up.
How's this?
"1946 - 1984: Took part in extensive anthropological research".
Why "anthropological research"?
Because it's better than saying "married to a baboon for 38 years".
Look, Ma, if I'm going to get this job as vice-principal, I'm gonna get it honestly Ooh, girls, I have a date with the most cultured, urbane, sophisticated man in the whole world!
You know George "Goober" Lindsey?
Even more sophisticated, Rose.
His name is Donald Parker Everett.
He's the new curator at the museum.
Oh, Blanche.
Honey, it's not a good idea to go out with someone you work with.
Oh, come on, Dorothy.
I've heard you talk about Ted the track coach, how sexy and virile he is.
Just talk.
I wouldn't dream of going after him.
Even if she did, he'd easily outrun her.
Rose, it's not that funny.
I know.
I think I better keep the lid on this paint thinner.
Dorothy, I can't finish this picture.
Why not?
I can't paint a horse from memory.
What you need is a model.
I know a place where you can see a horse.
I know a place where you can see horses and lots of little men in silk pants with whips.
Or you could go to the racetrack instead.
Well, that could be fun!
What do you say, Dorothy?
Um, I don't think so.
I haven't been to the track in 15 years.
Oh, go on, Dorothy, take her.
It'll be a fun afternoon and Rose can memorize a horse.
I'd rather not.
Oh, Dorothy, please.
Come on, be a pal.
I'd do it for you.
Why can't you go by yourself?
I'm afraid to go to the track by myself.
You always meet a lot of lecherous guys out for a good time who think they can impress you by throwing their money around.
Oh, damn!
I wish I didn't have to go to work today.
Well, Dorothy, you go.
You can relax and take your mind off your job interview tomorrow afternoon.
Oh, all right.
Oh, good!
I, uh, I would lend you my pass to the jockeys' lounge, but you don't want to date a jockey.
The sex is over too fast, and afterwards the only nice thing they have to say to you is, "Good girl, good girl".
Sophia, I've decided to wear this little watch on a chain, nestled cunningly in my cleavage.
What other accessories do I need?
Implants.
Dorothy's parking the car.
I have to get a horse in this picture while it's still fresh in my mind.
I don't know whether to paint Old Silver, the horse who brought the news to St. Olaf that the British had no intention of coming or Old Brisker, the horse who, because of a printing error on the ballot slips, was elected water commissioner for six months.
Hi.
Hi!
Did you have fun at the track?
You went to the track?
Oh, we had a wonderful day.
And thanks to Dorothy's expert tips, I made enough money to buy more art supplies.
Dorothy, I want to see you in the kitchen.
I'm sorry, Ma, I'm a little busy.
Fine.
I'll eat a bowl of chili and we'll talk later, in your bedroom.
Coming, Mother.
What the hell were you doing at the racetrack?
Oh, Ma, come on, you're making too much of this.
I haven't gambled in 15 years.
And I didn't put down any bets for myself today, either.
It was just nice to know that I could still pick a winner.
This from a woman who's got a Dukakis bumper sticker covering up her Mondale bumper sticker?
Look, Ma, I admit that once I did have a small gambling problem.
A small problem?
You bet against your own son's Little League team!
Ma, I had to.
I knew that their star pitcher had after-school detention.
You were his teacher, you gave him detention.
Of all the things you could have inherited from your father, you had to pick this damn gambling disease.
Oh, Ma, will you get off my back?
You don't have to worry about me.
I had a nice day at the track, and that's that.
And Pop did not have a problem.
Dorothy, I spent too many years denying your father's addiction.
He was a gambler to his dying day.
In fact, his last words were, "10 bucks says I don't need this oxygen tank".
Why, Donald.
I see by my watch that you're right on time.
You're looking lovely.
Thank you.
I'll just get my purse, and we'll go.
Oh, this is my roommate, Rose.
Hello.
Blanche, Before you leave, will you take a look at this horse and tell me if it looks like Old Brisker is pulling the beer wagon?
Honey, why don't you ask Donald to look at Old Brisker?
He knows a lot about art.
I'd be happy to.
It's quite good.
It's an interesting primitive.
In fact, it makes me think of Grandma Moses.
She must have been pretty strong to do the work of a Clydesdale.
You really can't blame her, Donald.
She doesn't work in the museum the way we do.
I call them Winter of St. Olaf, and Spring of St. Olaf, and Summer of St. Olaf.
Why haven't you painted the Fall of St. Olaf?
Because it hasn't happened yet.
Although we came pretty close when new math came along.
Rose, I think he's referring to autumn.
Donald, maybe we'd better go.
You know, Rose, we have a special section set aside for local artists.
When you finish the series, maybe we could hang them in the museum.
Wow!
Hanging in the museum?
Well, none of my relatives ever hung in a museum.
Oh, wait.
Uncle Gustav.
Well, actually, he hung in the barn.
But that was only when he discovered his horse had defeated him for water commissioner.
Oh, so you're studying for your interview?
Uh-huh.
I know it's a lot of added responsibility, but I really want this job.
Then why are you reading the racing form?
The racing form?
Why would you think I'm reading the racing form?
You can't lie to your mother.
Mothers always know when you lie.
Don't you think I knew what your brother Phil was doing in the bathroom when he said he was oiling his baseball glove?
He was working on his Simplicity patterns.
Well, good night.
Sleep tight.
See you in the morning light.
It's the best light to paint by, you know.
Oh, I like this painting.
And I'm getting better at it all the time.
Pretty soon I'll be able to copy St. Olaf's most famous religious painting, The Last Pancake Breakfast.
Blanche!
Honey, what's wrong?
You're shaking.
I have been humiliated and degraded.
Many times.
You just figured it out now?
The evening started off wonderfully.
Donald took me to a beautiful restaurant, and he ordered everything in French, which totally confused our waiter, Chip.
Then he took me dancing, and he was a perfect gentleman.
Get to the humiliation and degradation part.
Then I suggested we go back to his place.
When we got there, I went to the bathroom to freshen up.
After I had removed all of my clothes I noticed his monogrammed velour bathrobe hanging there.
Thinking only of his pleasure, I decided to slip into it.
Oh, God, I looked so fetching.
I could not wait for him to see me.
So I emerged, framed in the doorway, and slowly let the bathrobe slide from my perfect body.
And you know what he said to me?
"Put your clothes back on.
I'm gonna take you home".
How could I ever look him in the eye?
Why, I'll never be able to go back to work again.
Oh!
"Put your clothes back on"?
That's the first time anybody's ever said that to me.
Well, without shining a flashlight in my face.
Hello?
I'm Dorothy Zbornak.
I have an appointment about the vice-principal's job.
Yes, unfortunately my car broke down, and I'm stuck here at the auto mechanic's.
Is there any way that Mr. Pratt could see me later this afternoon?
He could?
Thanks so much.
I'll see you then.
$20 to win on Ma's Mouth.
It's a hunch.
Hi.
You're still painting out there?
Yeah.
But I'm having trouble.
I don't know.
I think it's impossible to paint autumn in St. Olaf.
How come?
Maybe it's because of the horrible St. Olaf falling leaf story.
Please, Rose.
If this is a story about a man named Leif, I don't want to hear it.
It's not that long No.
It has a surprise ending.
All right, Rose.
Just the ending, but keep it short.
Splat.
Hi, girls.
Hi, Blanche.
You're not gonna go to work dressed like that, are you?
No, Rose.
I'm gonna put on pumps instead of slippers.
Why does she even ask such things?
I'll allow the question.
No, Rose.
I'm not going to work.
Oh, girls, I just can't!
Donald will be there.
Blanche, you're gonna have to face that man sometime.
Look, I appreciate your concern, Rose, but I will not go into that museum today.
I have my dignity.
I have my pride.
Oh, Blanche, your copy of Slung magazine just arrived.
Ooh.
Dorothy Zbornak, you're in big trouble.
What?
What did I do?
You lied to me, that's what you did.
I was going through your purse and look at what I found.
Betting slips.
You went to the track again.
How could you, Dorothy?
I spent the best years of my life trying to give you a sense of moral responsibility.
Ma, what were you doing in my purse?
Stealing.
But, Dorothy, weren't you supposed to interview for that vice-principal's job yesterday?
I rescheduled.
For when?
All right, I rescheduled and then I missed the appointment.
Dorothy, it's happening again.
You're losing control.
Ma, I really didn't want that job anyway.
I don't need that kind of pressure in my life.
You know what you're gonna wind up with in your life?
Nothing.
Then what are you gonna do?
Sponge off your kids?
Move in with them?
Have them take care of you?
OK, bad example.
But I'm telling you, Dorothy, this is gonna ruin your life.
Well, Dorothy, I'm worried about you Oh, please, don't you start.
I had a problem 15 years ago.
That's a long time.
I've learned a little something since then.
A lot has happened.
And I've lived with the temptations.
Well, isn't that something?
You think you know somebody, then you find out something like this.
Hard to believe.
I'll say.
To think Dorothy's lived with The Temptations.
I've never even been to one of their concerts.
Rose, what are you doing?
I heard the creative process is a lot like giving birth, so I'm doing my Lamaze breathing.
Oh.
For a minute there, I thought I wasn't the only one with the invisible man fantasy.
I am so uptight.
I mean, Donald's expecting this painting, and I really don't want to let him down.
Listen, after what he did to me, feel free to let him down.
You know, Blanche, I was thinking about that story you told us about you and Donald.
You mean when I dropped my robe and stood there in all my nakedness and asked him for a romp?
Right.
I was wondering if maybe you were too direct?
In what way?
How can I explain this?
OK.
You see this little possum in my St. Olaf painting?
Well, every year she goes into her mating ritual, and gives off little signals.
I mean, she releases a scent, she changes the way she stands, she makes tiny little whistling noises.
I do that.
Yes, but don't you see?
That's all she does.
I mean, she plays hard to get.
And believe me, it works.
I mean, men find her very attractive.
You mean males?
No, I mean men.
Blanche, I need you to take me to the eye doctor.
It's time for a new prescription.
I thought Dorothy was taking you.
I don't know any Dorothy.
She's your daughter, Sophia.
I'm being dramatic, you moron.
I mean, I spit at the name Dorothy.
I have no daughter.
I have no spit.
Honey, can't you go to the eye doctor tomorrow?
Please!
I can hardly see my own hand in front of my face.
That's my hand, Sophia.
Oh, thank God.
I saw so many liver spots, I thought I was being attacked by a Dalmatian.
Dorothy Zbornak.
Yeah, listen.
I need to place another bet.
I'll get that money to you tomorrow.
No, I'm good for it.
Listen, there's a horse that looks good to me at Hialeah today.
Salisbury Shrew, in the second race.
Make it a hundred.
Let's go, Dorothy.
Oh, I gotta go.
Thanks, Frank.
Sophia, why are you up?
Same reason you're up.
You're filled with anxiety?
I'm old.
I'm not old.
Oh, forgive me.
I'm supposed to support your vain, narcissistic fantasy that you're still in your forties.
It's either that or a big rent raise.
Hi, you guys.
What are you doing up?
Sophia's old, and I'm filled with anxiety.
Blanche, you can't stay home from work forever.
Can't you just swallow your pride?
There's no room for it.
She just scarfed down a bag of Chips Ahoy.
Why are you insulting me?
It's a defense mechanism.
I guess it's to hide my feelings when I'm deeply upset.
Oh, well, I understand.
In that case, I won't take it personally.
Thanks, you human mattress.
I'm sorry.
I'm just so worried about Dorothy.
I keep remembering how bad it was the last time she let this gambling thing take over her life.
There was nothing I could do.
That's when she hit bottom.
What happened?
Because of her gambling debts, she had to borrow money from loan sharks, and she couldn't pay it back.
She came to me crying because she was gonna lose her house.
The only way we could get the money was with Sal's life insurance.
So you killed Sal?
Of course not.
By the way, what kind of policy do you have?
Well, we cashed in the policies and paid the sharks off.
But I didn't give Dorothy the money until she agreed to go to Gambler's Anonymous.
I can understand now why you're deeply upset.
Thanks, you human speed bump.
Sorry.
We understand.
I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it.
Hello?
Yes, Frank, I am aware of that.
No, I'll have the money to you today.
Cash.
Of course.
Dorothy, I need a fresh eye.
Does this look any good to you?
It's great.
You didn't even look at it.
I'll bet you can't even tell me what it is.
Well, of course I can, Rose.
It's What the hell is it, Rose?
That's it.
I don't think I want to paint for the museum any more.
Whatever you want.
It's making me a nervous wreck.
I used to love painting.
Now it's getting to be an obsession.
And obsessions can be dangerous.
That's just because you're prone to them.
Some people aren't.
Where the hell is the racing form?
Gee, I don't know.
Why do you need it?
I don't.
It's not important.
Actually, Rose, I need cash.
Quick.
And I'm up to my limit at the automated teller.
Is this about the phone call you just received?
The phone Yes, yes.
It was the paperboy.
I forgot to pay him last week.
How much do you need?
$250.
Isn't that kind of a lot for the paperboy?
Rose, the truth is The truth is, I need the money so my mother can have an operation.
Sophia needs an operation?
Well, not an actual operation.
She's just going to have her face done.
How's she gonna get it done?
Southwestern, Rose.
Look, Rose, I need the money.
You're just going to have to trust me.
Well, of course I trust you.
You're my best friend.
You can take everything I have.
Well, don't give me everything you have.
I mean, all I need is a couple hundred bucks, you know, so that I can Oh, you don't owe me any explanation.
Here.
I want you to take my bank card, and take as much money as you need, and pay me back whenever you can.
Oh, thanks a lot.
And don't you worry, I'll have this money back before you know it.
Oh, no hurry.
I trust you completely.
Yeah, well Rose, I mean, you shouldn't trust anyone completely.
Dorothy, if I can't trust you, whom can I trust?
You're practically a sister to me.
Yeah, well, sisters often lie, Rose.
And even best friends take advantage of each other occasionally.
I don't think so.
Rose, you should.
You're being very naive.
I'm not naive.
Yes, you are.
You are being naive now.
Don't you see?
I'm stealing your money.
I know, Dorothy.
But I was hoping you'd have a hard time taking advantage of somebody who cares about you as much as I do.
I need help, Rose.
Oh, God, I hate the lying!
Dorothy, I lied to you, too.
You could never have used that bank card.
You don't have my personal identification number.
And you'd never guess it in a thousand years.
Rose, honey, it's right here.
You've written it on the card.
Well, that's because I have trouble guessing it, too.
So then I went up to the podium, and I said, "My name is Dorothy, and I have a gambling problem".
You know, when I left Gambler's Anonymous 15 years ago, I thought I'd never have to say those words again.
Well, let's hope this time you get cured.
Ah, you're never really cured, Rose.
You just have to learn to live each day just one day at a time.
Well, of course you do, Dorothy.
If you took them two at a time you'd end up constantly changing your underwear.
Go ahead, stand up and say it.
"My name is Rose, and I'm an idiot".
Oh, hi, girls.
Ah, Blanche, you're finally dressed!
Yeah, I went back to work.
Good for you!
And you know what I found out the reason Donald rejected me was?
He has this strict personal rule against getting involved with anybody he's working with.
I told you.
Yeah.
Well, anyway, he knew it was either violate this rule of his, or quit his job and come after me.
So that's what he did, he quit!
And then he asked me to go out with him.
And what did you say?
Well, I've decided to take Rose's advice.
I'm playing hard to get, like that little possum in your story.
Did I mention the part where you hang upside down from the tree?
I can do that.
{END OF EPISODE 24}{START OF EPISODE 25}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Pussycat, are you doing the grocery shopping today?
Yeah.
Something you want?
Uh, pick up a couple of chicken breasts, and why don't we say 40 better make that 45 tubes of sunscreen.
Oh, Sophia, I've made that mistake before.
The best thing to do is just turn the oven down if you don't want the chicken to burn.
Rose, honey, I don't think my mother was planning on using the suntan lotion on the chicken.
What do you mean, you've made that mistake before?
President Bush is coming to dedicate the new senior citizen" center down the street.
The motorcade goes right by here.
So?
So all the neighbors on the block will be out on their lawns.
It'll be a hundred degrees out there, and they will need protection.
They can pay me or fry in the sun.
Oh, Ma, that is a terrible thing to do to your neighbors.
I'll cut you in for half.
We should also sell visors.
There's a man on our lawn.
Get the net.
Well, hello there.
Anything I can do for you?
At least now she asks.
Good afternoon.
Sorry to bother you.
I'm Agent Bell with the Secret Service.
Well, won't you come right in?
Thank you, Mrs. Devereaux.
How did you know my name?
I know all your names.
This house has been under surveillance.
Why are you watching our house?
It's a security measure.
The President wants to stop at one house on his way to dedicate the senior citizens' center.
Why he can't he use the Arco station like everyone else?
Are you saying Mr. President George Bush might stop here?
He wants to keep in touch with the people.
We chose this house as a possibility because there are four senior citizens living under one roof.
Now, a few other houses are being considered besides this one.
If you don't mind, I'll start with Mrs. Devereaux.
Fine.
We'll just be waiting in he kitchen.
Not making fun of the Vice President.
Now that we're alone, tell me all about yourself.
You first.
I've always been the kind of person who liked to have fun.
Dorothy, do you realize it has been four days since I have enjoyed the company of a man?
I know, Blanche.
I've been marking the days off on my Big Ships of the Navy calendar.
I don't think I can stand it much longer.
My body feels like a Corvette up on blocks with its engine racing and the wheels just spinning and spinning with nowhere to go.
I feel like I'm gonna explode.
Dorothy, you have to help me.
You have to do something.
Honey, there's nothing I can do, so get that look out of your eye and let go of my hand.
Girls, I am so excited.
I just got a big bonus at work.
Ah!
And guess what I've decided to do with it.
What?
I'm gonna have my breasts enlarged.
You're not serious, Blanche?
Sure I am.
Breasts are back in fashion.
And what God didn't give me, Dr. Myron Rosensweig will.
Oh, that man is the Picasso of plastic surgeons.
Just be sure he doesn't attach one of them to your forehead.
Yes.
Oh, Rose, hi.
Listen, I just picked up these pamphlets at a cosmetic surgeon, and I want you to help me decide which alterations I'll get.
Blanche, none of these women have any tops on.
Well, I know, honey.
These are the "after" pictures of satisfied customers.
I was thinking about having my breasts done like hers.
All right, Blanche, but do you think black really suits you?
Here you go, sweetheart.
Dorothy, have you ever heard of something called dirty-dancing?
Well, of course, Blanche.
They did it in that movie.
What movie?
Lawrence of Arabia, Rose.
This flier that came in the mail says they're gonna start a dirty-dancing course down at Lawson's dance studio.
What do you say, Dorothy?
Oh, no.
I can't see myself swinging my hips and wildly gyrating my pelvis.
I am not interested.
And the world heaves a collective sigh of relief.
You just hit that music, girl, and follow my lead.
Look into my eyes.
Rose!
Hi, girls.
This is not what it looks like.
What they do is their business, but if I ever see your hand on Rose's behind, it'll kill me.
Wow, what a hunk.
I know.
Eat your hearts out.
Blanche, did it ever occur to you that possibly Rose or I might be interested in Jake?
Yes.
And you still used every cheap ploy to nab him before we had a chance?
Yes.
What do you have to say for yourself?
Damn, I'm good.
Well, thank you, Mrs. Devereaux.
If the President decides to come, this administration would appreciate it if Well, if you didn't hit on him.
I thought everybody'd like some flugelkaka.
Mrs. Nylund, would you mind answering a few questions?
As long as it's not math.
Here, honey, why don't you sit right down here?
He's very nice.
Oh, if you need to know anything else about me, um, I have pictures.
So do we.
Now, our records show that you come from a town called St. Olaf.
You wanna tell me about it?
Mrs. Nylund, are you all right?
It's just that nobody's ever asked before.
Well I don't get it.
They don't seem to have anything in common.
I guess it's just like that old saying, you know - "opposites attract".
Oh, that's very true.
Back in St. Olaf, Ollie Knutenspringle and his wife Bridget were opposites in every way.
I mean, he was fat, she was thin, he was neat, she was sloppy, he was tall, she was short.
He was cheap, she was extravagant.
He was Opposites.
We get the picture!
Anyway, I'll never forget the time they sang at our annual talent show, right after the herring juggling act.
You mean to tell me that somebody actually juggled herring?
No!
It was the herring who did the juggling.
Tiny little Ginsu knives.
Really very dangerous.
I mean, one false move, they could've filleted themselves.
I hate you.
Rose, what in hell are you doing?
It is 2am.
I couldn't sleep, so I decided to get up and make a batch of spearhuven krispies.
It's an ancient Scandinavian midnight snack.
I guess after a night of pillaging and raping, a viking wants a little something to go with his cocoa.
Well, they smell God-awful.
Yeah.
Just when you're about ready to throw up from the stench, that's when they're done.
Who wants some?
Rose, if these had been offered to the Donner Party, they still would've eaten each other.
Don't be silly, Dorothy.
They're delicious.
You just have to know how to eat them.
You hold your nose with one hand, and you pop a krispy in your mouth with the other.
Mm.
Mm!
That tastes like cheesecake, fresh strawberries and chocolate ice cream.
My gosh, you're right.
That is the best thing I have ever tasted.
This is delicious.
Mm!
Hey, give me a break.
You can't smell that from the hall.
Then there was the time Hans Erikson wanted to take an elk to the prom.
The whole town was divided on that one.
Pussycat, if you're writing to your brother Phil, tell him I said thanks for the Underoos.
And Spider-Man scared the hell out of my doctor.
I'm not writing to Phil.
I'm just jotting down some things that I want to say to the President.
Oh, Dorothy, you're not gonna make a scene, are you?
Oh, hey, come on.
Give me a little credit.
I mean, it's not like I'm some kind of hothead.
Please!
I'd put you about even with John McEnroe.
Except McEnroe knows when to stop.
Come on, Ma.
She's right.
Don't you remember the ti- How could you forget?
only spare towels I could find.
Put 'em around the bucket in case the leak spreads.
Wait a minute, Rose.
Is that my Cabana Club beach towel you have there?
Is it this one with the naked man and woman being swept up in the waves?
Yes, that's it.
You can't use this towel.
Blanche, Blanche, it's an emergency.
We'll replace it next week.
Oh, no, you cannot replace this towel.
There are too many fond memories attached to this towel.
Blanche, please.
I am in no mood to hear about the parade of endless sexual encounters that you have experienced up and down the Florida coastline, with only this towel between your hot flesh and the cold, wet sand.
I brought my son Skippy home from the hospital in this towel, Dorothy.
You're lying, Blanche.
Damn, you're good.
Happy birthday, boys and girls Happy birthday to you Welcome to Mr. Ha Ha's Hotdog Hacienda.
Isn't this fun?
Dorothy, you haven't even touched your Mr. Ha Ha dog.
You're right.
There.
I touched it.
Now it's the Mr. Ha Ha birthday roundup.
When I call your name, please come up on stage.
Robbie Speener!
Please say you didn't do this.
Jeannie Taylor!
Please tell me you didn't do this.
Dorothy Zbornak!
I just wish you'd watch yourself, Dorothy, because we're all pretty excited about this visit.
Forget it, Rose.
If President Bush steps in this house, I'm not gonna waste an opportunity like that.
I'm gonna give him a piece of my mind.
You try and talk to her.
Dorothy, if the President comes here, you can't criticize him.
Watch me.
Oh, Dorothy, don't ever antagonize the man who could answer the question, "You and what army"?
What's your gripe with the President, anyway?
He calls himself the "education president," but our education system has some serious problems.
I see the illiteracy, I see dropouts, I see kids who can't even find India on a map.
Well, to be fair, Dorothy, that stumped Columbus too.
And education is just part of the problem.
I mean, there's age discrimination, women's rights Oh, Rose Rose, honey, now why didn't you tell us what was going on?
Because you can't help me find a job.
Because nobody or nothing can make me young again.
Oh, all right, Rose, so your life isn't the same as it used to be.
The rules have changed.
But it's happened before, hasn't it?
I mean, what did you do after Charlie died?
Buried him.
I mean, what did you do the next day, when you had to start putting your life together?
I couldn't do it!
I'd been a housewife for 32 years.
I totally depended on Charlie.
Yeah, but the point is, eventually you did what you had to do.
You took care of yourself.
Sweetheart, you're now in exactly the same position.
Not exactly.
I'm five years older, and nobody wants me around.
Oh, honey, we want you around.
We just can't afford to pay you.
Rose.
Rose, look at me.
Rose, listen.
You are feeling sorry for yourself.
Sure, you're five years older.
So am I, so is Blanche.
All right, so you have a few more wrinkles.
So do I, so has Blanche.
All right, you're a little thicker around the middle.
So is Blanche.
Oh, girls, I am devastated, just devastated.
Honey, what happened?
I asked my teacher for help, like you all told me to.
He said the only way I would get an A on his final is if I sleep with him.
No!
Oh, yes.
I just don't know what to do.
Get it in writing.
Blanche, that is terrible.
I hope you told him off.
Well, first I was so stunned, I didn't know what to say.
And then I marched back up to his desk and I looked him straight in the eye and I said, "I'll think it over".
Blanche, there is nothing to think over.
What he did is sexual harassment.
He cannot get away with that.
Nils Felander attempted to harass me repeatedly.
What do you mean, he attempted to?
He worked at Lars Erikson's Drugstore and Tackle Shop.
He was a soda jerk.
Now that I think about it, he was the town jerk.
Every Saturday afternoon I'd go in and have a sundae.
Well, Nils would arrange the ice cream scoops in an obscene way.
I could never prove it because by the time I would take it home to show my father, the the evidence had  Melted.
Yes.
To this day, every time I pass an ice cream parlor or a tackle shop, I blush.
Well, I just got off the phone with Washington.
I'm sorry, ladies, but the President would prefer to visit a more typical American family.
Typical?
We're typical.
I'm the mother, and I have 2.3 children.
You won't find a more typical family than that.
Girls, look.
How do I look?
Oh, great, Blanche.
Great?
Or gorgeous?
Gorgeous.
Well, what about sexy?
Yes.
Enticing?
I'll handle this.
Blanche, no woman ever looked better than you look right now, and no one ever will.
Thank you, Dorothy.
Honestly, Rose, sometimes it's like pulling teeth to get a little compliment out of you.
What do you say, girls?
Are you in this with me?
You bet we are, honey.
This is what friendship is all about - banding together when the going gets tough, sacrificing sleep and personal comfort, putting someone else's need ahead of your own.
It's beautiful.
Let me know how it turns out in the morning.
Good night.
Let's make a pact that we'll always take care of each other, that we'll never desert each other, no matter what.
You can count on me, honey.
Do you think it's gonna be that easy getting rid of me, Rose?
That was rhetorical, Rose.
Ah, but what a comforting thought, knowing you'll never be alone.
And listen, what the hell?
If we do have to go to a nursing home, let's all go together.
But what happens when there's only one of us left?
Don't worry.
I can take care of myself.
Easy, easy.
Ma!
That's my best china.
You got it for me when I got married, you remember?
Who could forget?
I carried it all the way from Sicily!
And for what?
So you could get divorced.
I should have gotten you something returnable, like a donkey.
You know, I've eaten through a lot of great times on these plates.
Yeah.
You know, with Alma here, I've been thinking a lot about the two of us.
What do you mean?
The one thing you never do is treat me like an old lady.
You treat me like a person.
I appreciate that.
You're a good daughter, Dorothy.
Ma, I'm overwhelmed.
I don't know what to say.
I'll tell you what you could say.
You could say I don't owe you the $50.
Ma, you are a crazy lady, and I love ya, I love ya, I love ya.
I love you too, pussycat.
That's beautiful.
I've got to try to convince him to choose you guys.
You're as close as any family I've ever seen.
I can't believe he bought it.
What do you mean, Sophia?
We get along great.
He's got no idea what it's like, living with you monkeys.
I get sick every time I think of the time Ma, Rose isn't talking to me.
Enjoy it while it lasts.
Now, good night.
Honey - Oh, hi, Dorothy.
Honey, can I talk to you?
No, go away.
But I can't sleep, Sophia, and it's all because Rose isn't talking to me.
I could care less.
Now get out of my room!
Sophia?
I'm not in.
Wait for the beep, then leave a message.
Beep.
Hi, this is Rose Rose, shut up and get in here!
I see you're with two double-crossing ex-friends of mine.
I'll come back later.
What do you think this is, the 7-Eleven?
I'm not open all night.
Rose, we feel terrible about what we've done.
What have you done?
We're really very sorry.
Sorry about what?
Sorry isn't good enough.
How can I ever trust you again?
Trust who?
Please, Rose, let's not talk about trust after the terrible things you wrote.
Will someone please tell me what the hell you're talking about?
Blanche and I read Rose's diary.
And she wrote some terrible things about us in there.
About you?
I didn't write anything about you.
I didn't even know you when I kept that diary.
What are you talking about?
That was my 4-H diary.
I kept it one summer when I raised two pigs for the county fair.
You kept a diary about raising two pigs?
You know another way to get a 4-H pig diary badge?
Stop!
Even surgical stockings only have so much elastic!
Hello.
Girls, this nightgown is so sheer I believe you can see right through it.
Oh, hello, Fidel.
Hello, Blanche.
How are you?
You don't have cataracts - you tell me.
Beat it, you 50-year-old mattress.
Why, you you miserable old Blanche, Blanche, Blanche.
You know the rules.
When one of you is out with Fidel, the other one does not interfere.
My apologies.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go take a long, hot, steamy bath, with just enough water to barely cover my perky bosoms.
You're only gonna sit in an inch of water?
Oh, that does it!
That does it!
No, no, no, no, ladies!
Dorothy, why don't we have a pet?
Anybody want a cracker?
Never mind.
Good evening.
Well, I guess you know why I'm here.
Sure.
Nobody can leave after just one helping of flugelkaka.
No, ma'am.
And don't even kid about that.
No, I'm here to tell you that tomorrow the President of the United States will be coming to your house.
Oh, my!
Oh!
What did you How did you do that?
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Rose, what's all this?
Oh, I want the President to feel welcome, so I'm making him a sign.
It's gonna say "Welcome, President Bush.
"We are pleased to have you in our home.
"We're really thrilled that you're visiting Miami.
"We hope you have a good time and a safe trip home, "and good luck on running the country".
It's catchy, Rose.
Are you sure you want to go to all that trouble?
Honey, he'll just be here a few minutes.
Are you kidding?
This is the most exciting thing that's ever happened to me.
More exciting than winning the annual St. Olaf me-and-my-pet look-alike contest?
Yes.
But mostly because I don't have to swim with a duck in my mouth.
Boy, when the President gets here, am I gonna let him have it.
What do you think I should hit him with first?
Inadequate funding for education?
The plight of the hungry and homeless?
Pollution of the air and the water?
I mean, the problems are endless.
Dorothy, you can't talk like that to the President.
Watch me.
Sure, there are problems, but can't we just pray they'll go away by themselves?
You haven't.
Dorothy, if you make a scene, this whole thing is gonna blow up in our faces.
Why do you say that?
Because something always does.
Let me refresh your memory.
OK, we have the suntan lotion, Chap Stick, and half a dozen cheap, tawdry romance novels.
Then we're all set.
We have everything we need for the cruise.
Girls, listen, maybe we don't have everything we need.
What are we missing?
Well, we are going away for a romantic weekend to the Bahamas with Jeff and Rich and Randy.
In this day and age it might be a good idea to take along some protection.
What kind of protection?
Two armed Pinkerton guards.
No, Blanche is talking about, uh A NestlÃ©'s Crunch?
One over.
An enema bag?
To the right.
Dentu-Grip?
Condoms, Rose.
Condoms, condoms, condoms!
Calm down, lady.
You just get outta prison?
Girls, what do you think?
Well, it's not a bad idea, but I'm a little embarrassed.
Oh, me too.
Embarrassed?
There's no reason to be embarrassed.
These are discreet professionals.
This is a private matter.
Whatever we buy is nobody's business but our own.
I'd like a package of these, please.
And, uh, I'll take these.
And I'll take these.
Now, that wasn't so bad, was it?
Uh, Joe, I need a price check on some condoms.
These three ladies here want a couple of boxes of the King George prophylactics.
The lambskins or the ultrasensitive?
Two of 'em have the lambskins and the blonde has the ultrasensitive, in black.
Plumber.
Could I see some identification?
Come on in.
So, you two are the proud parents of the new Dolan Standard Lowboy, huh?
Yes, we're sending out engraved announcements.
Well, you probably want to get her operational as soon as possible.
After all, she's quite a showpiece.
Where do I install her?
Well, actually, uh, Lou, we're going to install her ourselves.
Follow me.
Hold it.
You're not serious?
Why not?
You gotta be a man, for God's sakes!
You know, to tell you the truth, Lou, women are capable of more than just cleaning these things.
Is that so?
Well, as long as you ladies are playing plumber, why don't you play moving man, too?
Fine!
Fine, we will!
Was that a plumber?
No, Ma, no.
It was a little girl selling Girl Scout toilets.
You let a plumber get away?
We don't need him!
Like hell!
I'm going after him.
Come on, Dorothy, let's move this little beauty.
OK.
Ohh!
Ooh.
Wait, wait.
No, honey, she won't budge.
Oh, Rose, I don't think we're gonna be able to move it.
Dorothy, if the Egyptians built the pyramids, now, we can move this toilet.
Fine.
Get me and I'll have it out of here in no time.
Oh, come on.
Give me a minute, I'll think of something.
I'd love you to meet my roommates.
Unfortunately, they're not home right now.
Dorothy, I gotta talk to you.
I owe you a big apology.
For what, Ma?
For what I said before.
You know, about you not knowing a thing about plumbing.
Dorothy, you're a genius.
Ma, wait.
What are you talking about?
I walk into the living room, and there's a toilet in front of the television set.
It's an old lady's dream come true!
You wouldn't believe all the security out there.
Of course, they have to have it.
When the President comes to town, it brings out all the oddballs.
Hi, it's me, Stan.
Stanley, what are you doing here?
I'm glad you asked.
Inside this box is my best novelty yet, not to mention the perfect tie-in to the President's visit.
Ladies the George Bush point of light on a stick.
You know, Dorothy, every now and then it dawns on me you had children with this man.
Stanley, get out.
Wait.
Please.
I just took a bath on those Daniel Ortega buttons that say "four more years".
Out!
I can never tell when you ladies are kidding.
Out!
Out!
Good one.
Stan, I want you gone before the President gets here.
Come on, Dorothy.
I'm a big fan.
Maybe he'd like to meet me.
I almost voted for him.
I would've if I could have registered.
You know those things go straight to the IRS?
So could I. See you.
Oh, what did I ever see in that man?
Don't blame yourself.
You were young, you were carefree.
You were just one of those girls who marries the first guy who knocks her up.
Gee, this is really cool.
Yeah, I see that you've met Stanley Zbornak.
A novelty salesman, your ex-husband, father of your children, and if you don't mind me saying, first-class yutz.
Wow, they do know everything.
We had to run security clearances on everyone.
Everyone passed except for you, Mrs. Petrillo.
I can't believe it!
I spend one lousy night with Mussolini - and I do mean lousy - and I'm marked for life.
No, that's not it.
Our records list you as both Sophia Petrillo and Sophia Weinstock.
What's the deal?
Are you trying to hide something?
Is there a Mr. Weinstock?
OK, OK.
I'm tired of running.
Where do I begin?
Max Weinstock and my late husband, Salvadore, were in the restaurant business together in Brooklyn.
They had known each other since Ma, what's the matter?
Esther Weinstock is dead.
We grew up together.
She was my best friend.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
What happened?
She was fighting an oil rig fire in the Gulf of Mexico.
She was 88!
Well, it's great that she was able to work right up to the end.
Sophia?
Dorothy, do you hear a dog howling?
Behave yourself.
Hello, Mr. Weinstock.
Oh, my goodness, as I live and breathe!
Unfortunately.
You're little Dorothy Petrillo.
That's right.
You haven't changed a bit.
Same gorgeous smile.
Pretty eyes, beautiful figure, long golden blonde hair.
You have cataracts, don't you, Mr. Weinstock?
Since 1967.
Let's go.
Sophia.
Esther would have appreciated you being here.
I loved that woman.
She was the best, which is why she deserved a better husband.
Instead of a miserable, no-good, lowlife sleazeball.
Sophia, if you knew now what I knew then Ah, so what.
If you've got something to say, spit it out, Weinstock.
Don't push me, or I will.
There.
I pushed.
Too bad you weren't on a flight of stairs.
Ma, Ma, you're creating a scene.
Look, that was a long time ago.
Forget about it.
I can't forget.
This man stole money from us.
Because of him, our family went hungry.
Ma, we never went hungry.
Some nights I felt like dessert.
Listen, why don't we just leave this mess and go out and get something to eat?
Yeah, I'll ask Ma if she'd like to come.
It'll do her good to get out of the house.
Oh, she's been so depressed since she got back from that funeral.
I mean, she lost one of her oldest friends, and even though she made up with Max, she'll probably never see him again.
Well, you go and get her, we will try to cheer her up.
We don't want that poor little thing getting sick over this.
No.
Ma!
Oh, my God!
Dorothy, what is it?
What, honey?
Oh!
Good Lord.
Ma, what is going on here?
Afterglow.
So let's see if I've got this straight.
You and this Max Weinstock were Getting it on.
Thank you.
If you write that down, make it three times a night.
He'd like that.
And send me a copy.
So this was a casual fling?
Please.
I'm not the love 'em and leave 'em type.
At my age, I don't have the strength to do both.
We got married.
It was a lovely ceremony, no thanks to Dorothy.
Ma, listen, I have to talk to you.
Who's in charge here?
What's the problem?
I'm the caterer.
It's two o'clock.
The guests are waiting.
Why isn't the show on the road?
Ma, I know you're in there.
The wedding is off.
She doesn't approve.
She doesn't approve?
Now, look here, Stretch.
I have a hundred cheese puffs and a sensitive assistant both on the verge of collapse.
Whatever the problem is, overlook it.
My mother did with my marriage.
And if you say something smart, I'll slap you silly.
Listen, this is a private moment, so butt out, Rambo.
Ma, I have a confession to make.
Ma, I came here to beg you for the last time not to get married.
I didn't want you and Max together because it looked like you were cheating on Pop.
I know it doesn't make any sense, but I still think of the two of you as being married, and I didn't want Max taking Pop's place.
But now that I see the two of you so much in love, I realize I was just being selfish, Ma.
Ma, I want you to be happy.
And I know Pop would too.
I love you, pussycat.
This is more moving than Susan Hayward's climactic speech in I Want To Live!
You're ready to fly right out of here, aren't you?
Well, excuse me for living, Anita Bryant.
Could we please get married already, so I can get in on the hugging?
Places!
Oh, Sophia.
Honey, I want to wish you all the happiness in the world.
Oh, thank you, Blanche.
And, Sophia, I want to offer you a tradition Scandinavian wedding blessing.
Keflectoflafen flafenflurfen, potetaflingin faflafen.
I'm really touched.
I'm also soaking wet.
All right!
One group hug, and let's hit the road.
Oh, Sophia, honey  Uh-oh.
Either I mixed the Elvis list with the wedding list, or everyone in Max's family appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show.
Who cares already?
Let's just do it!
We are gathered here today to join this man and this woman in matrimony.
I just love weddings!
Oh, me too, me too.
You think you'll ever get married again?
Oh, I don't know.
I don't think so.
Me neither.
How about you, Blanche?
Oh, absolutely.
If the right man ever came along.
Course, he'd have to have the body of Mr. Mel Gibson, the personality of Mr. Johnny Carson, and the financial resources of Mr. Donald Trump.
I have a feeling the three of us are going to be together for a long time.
And do you, Max, take Sophia to be your lawfully wedded wife?
I do.
Then if no Elvis in this room has any objection to this union, I now pronounce you man and wife.
You may kiss the bride.
I do love you With all my heart Blue skies of Hawaii smile On this Our wedding day Ahahuh!
Well, thank you, Mrs. Petrillo.
By the way, what happened to Mr. Weinstock?
We found out we weren't compatible.
Thank God it was before we had kids.
All right.
Now that the Weinstock mystery is cleared up, I only have one more question to ask.
What organizations do you belong to?
We have to make sure none of them could be considered a threat to the President.
Oh, well, I'm a member of the Sierra Club, and Blanche belongs to the Daughters of the Confederacy.
And I'm a member of the Otto Club of St. Olaf.
Actually I'm an honorary member.
My name's not Otto.
I don't think that group could be considered subversive.
Subversive?
As in, "Do you advocate the overthrow of the government by force or violence"?
Violence.
Rose!
Actually there is one other organization that Rose and I belong to.
We might as well tell him.
He'll find out sooner or later.
Well, that about concludes the first meeting of the Hunk-a Hunk-a Burnin' Love Fan Club.
But before we adjourn, our secretary has a real special surprise.
A genuine Elvis artifact!
It's a partially-eaten pork chop.
Let me see.
He had beautiful teeth, didn't he?
It's wonderful!
This has to be a fake.
Elvis would never have left this much meat on a pork chop.
Dorothy, you're out of the club.
Meeting is adjourned.
Thank you, ladies.
See you next week.
Thank you for coming.
Well, I hope you're not too upset over this, Dorothy.
I've just been thrown out of an unauthorized Elvis fan club.
I'll try to pick up the pieces and go on with my life.
I mean, there must be a support group for people like me.
We're sorry, Dorothy, but the bylaws clearly state that any derogatory remarks about the King are grounds for immediate expulsion.
Maybe you ought to join an organization that is a little less fanatical in its devotion.
Like what, Blanche?
The PLO?
Is anyone as nervous as I am?
I can't believe I'm gonna meet the President of the United States.
Oh, if I say something stupid, I'll die.
Can we make a donation in lieu of flowers?
Dorothy, you're not still planning on saying all those things to the President, are you?
Oh, absolutely.
When he comes through that door, I am ready for him.
Read my lips.
I'm telling him off.
I'm telling him o Well, it's not really fair, 'cause I can hear you.
Dorothy, am I showing too much cleavage?
Yes.
Then I'm ready for him too.
Ladies, the motorcade is running late.
Now, the President won't actually be coming into the house.
He'll just be at the door for a photo opportunity.
So, Mrs. Devereaux, you might want to cover up.
Oh!
Here he comes.
Mr. President, I'd like you to meet Rose Nylund.
Hello, Mr. President.
Can I ask you something?
Why, sure.
Is the Oval Office as hard to vacuum as I think it is?
Well, I don't know.
There hasn't been a Hoover in the White House in, oh, 60 years.
That was a good one, sir.
And this is Sophia Petrillo.
Well, thank you for letting me visit your home.
You know, where I come from, when you visit somebody, you bring a little something.
A marble cake would've been nice.
Sophia!
What?
This is the President of the United States.
Then he should know better.
And this is Blanche Devereaux.
It's a real pleasure, Mr. President.
My!
You do have a lot of Secret Service men, don't you?
Hi, Blanche.
Hi, fellas.
Thank you, Mrs. Devereaux.
And, Mr. President, this is Dorothy Zbornak.
Dorothy, please?
Hello, Miss Zbornak.
I, uh Oh  Miss Zbornak is a teacher, Mr. President.
Do you have suggestions maybe on how we can help with this education thing?
Y Bush.
Well, it's good to know we have your backing.
Do you wanna let go of my hand now?
I think he means right now.
Oh, y  Well, I hope you've enjoyed this as much as I have.
Goodbye, ladies.
Goodbye, Mr. President.
I think he got the message.
