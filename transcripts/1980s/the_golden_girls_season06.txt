{START OF EPISODE 1}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Mornin', Ma.
How you feelin'?
I'm not sure.
What did we have for dinner last night?
Mexican.
Oh.
Then I'm OK.
Hi, girls.
Guess where I'm going.
A sanitarium up north?
I'm gonna enter the US Senior Sports Classic.
And I'm gonna win.
I had no idea that you could skate that well.
Oh, when I was young, my folks had me train for the US team.
Oh, the day the Olympic Committee came to St. Olaf, I was so nervous I put my skates on the wrong feet.
Oh Sonya Henderfinken's.
Morning, all.
Morning, honey.
Rose, for God's sake, you look like a giant elf.
Can I borrow that sometime?
Oh, Blanche, when is Becky coming?
I want to make sure that Ma is all moved into my room.
I'm pickin' her up at 10:30.
How come when company comes, I always have to sleep with Dorothy?
How come I always get the short stick?
It's because you are the short stick.
Put that down.
Why?
Since you're sleeping with me, no more liquid till Becky leaves.
I'm really looking forward to Becky's visit, even though she is in a delicate condition.
Yeah, knocked up and single.
How dainty.
No, I think it's great that she's brave enough to have that baby by herself.
Look who's talking - the president of knocked up and single.
At least Dorothy's pregnancy was an accident.
My daughter did it on purpose.
And went to a sperm bank.
A sperm bank.
Just the very idea of a bank havin' sperm.
At least the government didn't have to bail them out.
Well, I'm off to sign up.
Wish me luck.
I think it's wonderful that you're taking part in the Senior Sports Classic.
I might try entering it myself in 15 years, when I'm eligible.
If I can come up with an event.
The luge is the only one where you get to lie on your back.
Rose, are you all right?
Yes.
Oh, Mr. Ninervini, my ice-skating coach, said I should wear weights to strengthen my ankles.
Well, I'm off to the grocery.
Can I bring you anything?
Is that as fast as you can go?
Yes.
Don't get any dairy.
Rose, don't make fun of old people.
I'm wearing weights to strengthen my ankles.
They come in headbands?
Everybody, look who's here.
Oh!
Sweetheart, sit down, sit down.
Sit down, sit down.
Oh, you look beautiful.
How've you been?
Well, I love being pregnant.
Except for the hormones.
Yesterday I cried when the mail was late.
Oh, no, her mail was late.
Can you imagine what she was like when she had hormones?
So, I hear we only get you for three days.
Well, that depends.
On what?
On how my mother feels about my having the baby in Miami.
Here?
So close to Cuba?
I thought I could do it alone, but now that it's almost time, I'm gettin' nervous, and I realized I want to be near my mother.
I think it's great that you want to have your baby here.
Boy, in St. Olaf, the mother was always with the daughter when she gave birth.
And if the mother was out of town, then the mother of the father was there.
And if she was out of town, then we'd call Lucky Gunther.
Oh, what the hell.
She has a birthday coming up.
Why, Rose?
After the thresher accident, they replaced Lucky's arm with a forceps.
Yep.
Lucky Gunther.
He was in charge of delivering babies and handing out corn at the Rotary picnics.
Shut up, Rose.
So, Mama, is it all right if I have my baby here?
I only want what's best for you.
Don't you want to have your baby with your obstetrician in your hospital in Atlanta?
Oh, I'm not having my baby in a hospital.
I'm going to a birthin' center.
They emphasize natural childbirth in a relaxed atmosphere with no painkillers.
Becky, I know I told you where babies come from.
Did I ever mention where they come out?
Mama, why don't you just come see the place?
They have one of the biggest and best birthing centers right here in Miami.
Those theme-park people are always thinking, aren't they?
Come on.
Now, Blanche, before you close your mind, the least you can do is just take a look at the place.
I'll go with you if you need support.
Just give me a head start.
Oh.
This is a birthing center?
Where's the obstetrician?
Where's the equipment?
She'd be better off having the baby in your bedroom.
At least you've got stirrups.
And there's a better chance of finding a doctor.
First Becky conceives in a clinic, now she wants to deliver in a bedroom.
She's got the whole thing backwards.
Oh, this is all wrong.
What kind of dope would want to have a baby here?
This place makes me want to run out and get pregnant.
We have a lot of features here to create the right environment for both you and baby.
That's why we have music piped into every room.
So, uh, Mama, what do you think?
I think it would cost less to squat in a Laura Ashley showroom.
Look, I hate to be an alarmist, but what if the baby or the mother needs more than Muzak and throw pillows?
You're a meat eater, aren't you?
Sounds like there's a mommy in the making.
Sounds like there's a mommy on fire.
I'll be right back.
Oh, good.
We can sneak out.
Mother!
Becky, I have to admit, everything is well coordinated here, but, honey, wouldn't you be happier in a place where there's less stereo and more  morphine?
Well, I'm just lookin' into alternatives.
Hospitals have a rigid way of doin' things.
Why is she screamin'?
She's conscious.
I just want this to be an experience I'll never forget.
You're in luck.
You're about to see one of our deliveries.
We don't need the whole tour.
Mama that sounded just awful.
Well, darling, that is woman's lot in life - to bear the pain of childbirth.
What's man's lot in life?
Their eyebrows grow together.
Cheesecake, Rose?
Let's taste it and find out.
How's the skating going?
Oh, Coach Ninervini is really disappointed in my compulsory figures.
The only way I can make an "8" is to start with a snowman and then erase his head and arms.
By the time I do all that, the judges have lost interest.
So have I, Rose.
Honey, why don't you just quit?
Oh, they have a name for people who quit.
They call 'em "quitters".
Don't let them call you that, Rose.
You make them stick to "idiot".
Being at the birthing center today brought back vivid memories of when I delivered Rebecca.
It was so wonderful.
When I woke up, there she was in my arms, just as goofy and hung over as I was.
I vowed then and there to have 20 more.
Well, what stopped you?
The drugs wore off.
Remember how Stan was working late when I went into labor with Kate, so I called you, Ma?
Yeah, right in the middle of Uncle Miltie.
No, no.
Kate was born on a Friday.
Milton Berle was on Tuesday nights.
Yeah, I know.
Uncle Miltie was your father's pet name for - Never mind.
I was fortunate.
I was at a picnic when I delivered Kirsten.
Well, how was that fortunate?
Lucky Gunther already had boiling water in his corn pot.
Before you knew it, I was kissing her little buttery salted head.
Dorothy was born during the Depression mine.
We had no money, and when it came time to deliver, I couldn't afford to go to the hospital.
Hospitals were for the rich.
So Dorothy was born at home?
Homes were for the rich.
Babies were for the rich.
We tried selling her, but the rich have taste.
Did you have a hard labor?
Oh, it went on for days, but she was finally born.
Oh, Sophia!
Ma, nobody weighs 32 pounds when they're born.
That's what the guy from the circus said.
Hello.
Hi, darlin'.
You know, I've been thinkin'.
Maybe havin' a baby at a birthing center isn't so important.
I mean, the people at Lamaze got me a coach, so there's no reason I can't have a natural birth, even in a hospital.
Oh, Becky, that's wonderful.
And, darlin', I'll go to Atlanta with you.
I'll be right outside your door the whole time.
No, I think I better have the baby here in Miami.
I don't feel much like traveling.
Well, I just thought you'd be happier, giving birth in a place where nobody knows me.
I can't believe you.
Are you ever gonna get over my bein' a single mother?
It's just that I have a reputation in this town.
Cheesecake, Ma?
Well, I'm sorry if I embarrassed you.
You don't sound very sorry.
I had artificial insemination.
It's not like I slept with every man in town.
Chew it carefully, Ma.
Like they taught you at Shady Pines.
I would just be happier checking you into a hospital where I don't happen to be very popular with the staff.
That means more to you than being there at the most important moment of my life?
Oh, Blanche, there are so many hospitals in Miami.
Maybe you can find one where you haven't volunteered?
No.
Don't worry about it, Mother.
I'm leavin' in the morning, and I'm takin' my baby with me.
A little more to the left.
A little more to the left.
A little more to the left.
Ma.
Ma, wake up, wake up.
You're having a nightmare.
Oh, I dreamt I was in bed with Mel Gibson and Kim Basinger was to my right.
Go to sleep, Ma.
It's been 14 hours.
Just a sip of water, Dorothy?
Go to sleep.
Dorothy?
Dorothy?
Becky.
Becky, what's the matter?
Is something wrong?
I was just wondering what bein' in labor feels like.
How do you feel right now?
If I had any military secrets, I'd talk.
Showtime.
Honey, don't worry.
Just lie down.
Come on, get into bed.
We'll start timing the contractions.
I think one's coming on.
Oh oh oh.
Yikes!
Blanche, cut it out.
I'm trying to get some sleep.
Ma, Becky is in labor.
Oh.
Hold my hand.
When it hurts, squeeze.
Am I crazy or did I hear screaming?
Yes and yes.
It's Becky.
She's having the baby.
I'll put on some corn.
Um Call the County Hospital.
Tell them we'll be there in 20 minutes.
Oh, and call the coach.
The number's by the phone.
Fine.
Is there anything I can do?
Call the hospital and the coach.
You got that, Rose?
Oh, hurry.
Here comes another one.
Oh oh oh Yikes!
Hey, what do you do for a living, crack walnuts?
What's goin' on?
Something about a baby.
Oh, my God.
You mean it's started?
She's having contractions.
Don't worry about it.
Go back to sleep.
I'll call you when it graduates high school.
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
Come on, I'm taking you to the hospital right now.
Dorothy, this reminds me of when I took you to the hospital when you were in labor.
How so, Ma?
You were pregnant, I took you to the hospital.
It's not a big leap.
Ms. Devereaux, you forgot to fill out the name of the father.
I was artificially inseminated.
It was the father's last wish.
That and that people should be able to visit Graceland.
Oh, Doctor.
Thank God you're here.
I'm not the doctor.
I sell hats.
Mr. Ninervini?
Rose, who is this man?
He's my ice-skating - Oh, my God.
I must have called the wrong coach.
Oh, are you the doctor?
Yes.
The contractions have been approximately five minutes apart for the last 45 minutes.
I suggest you see how dilated she is.
Gee, I never would have thought of that.
Let's get her head up so the baby can get more oxygen.
Get her feet up so it'll be a boy.
Oh, raise her arms.
I want a girl.
Listen up!
I want three people in here - the pregnant woman, the coach and the baby.
You heard him, ladies.
OK, Doc, let's go.
If anybody is staying in here with my daughter, it is her mother.
We'll be in the waiting room if you need us.
OK.
How you doin', baby?
I'm scared.
Oh, honey, there's nothin' to be afraid of.
Just remember, pull, pull.
Oh, no.
That's skeet shooting.
Well, never mind.
We'll be just fine.
By the way, the reason that the baby's father isn't here is because he's busy.
I read the form.
I have a pretty good idea what he's busy doing.
What is taking so long?
It's been hours.
It took me three and a half days to have Dorothy.
I finally coaxed her out with a pork chop.
You know, Ma, you're really making me feel very bad.
You keep telling me how hard it was and how long it took to have me.
Did I mention the colic?
Ma, you're hurting my feelings.
Not as much as you hurt my oonie.
Ma!
I'll tell you something.
No matter how much pain I went through - and it was a lot - I wouldn't give up having you for anything in the world.
Thanks, Ma.
And I knew you'd be special.
And I didn't disappoint you?
A little.
Oh, I guess every mother feels their children are gonna be something special when they first see them.
And then we disappoint them by not becoming Olympic stars.
Oh, Rose.
Rose, honey, is that why you're training?
For your parents?
They always wanted me to be a champion ice skater.
They were so proud watching me practice.
I know their dream was for me to win a gold medal, but I hate ice-skating.
Rose, listen, you don't have to do anything to please your parents.
She's right.
I'd like to be proud of Dorothy for something, but I'm not gonna kill myself if that day never comes.
But my parents called me "Twinkle Toes".
I call Dorothy "Big Foot".
That doesn't mean she has to make tracks all over the Northwest.
What Ma is trying to say is that she loves me for what I am.
That's right - an over-the-hill schoolteacher who has to wait for the phone to ring to know if she's gonna work that day.
Ohh.
It doesn't matter what your parents want.
Rose, you're never gonna make them happy.
They're just gonna nag you and nag you until you want to grab their throats and choke 'em, but you don't, because you're in a hospital with resuscitating equipment!
In other words, Rose, hang up the skates.
Oh, Sophia.
Big Foot, thank you.
I mean, you're terrific.
You made me realize you don't have to please your parents.
I don't know how I can thank you.
No more ice-skating.
And I'm not gonna go over Niagara Falls in a barrel.
No, Rose, that you should do.
Good, good, good.
We're getting there.
Rest.
You're doin' fine.
Dr. Jackson, outside call.
Dr. Jackson, outside call.
You know why I call you pussycat, Pussycat?
Why, Ma?
Because you only gave me yarn for Christmas?
Because you fed me once and I hung around?
Because you used to put me out at night?
Because I love pussycats, and I love you.
And you were the only one in the family who could catch mice.
Rest.
Good, good.
We're getting there.
God, I don't think I can take much more of this.
Becky, if you hurry up and have this baby, I'll run down and get you some ice cream.
When are you gonna stop treatin' me like a child?
Oh, somebody's grumpy.
I want her out of here.
Why, Becky, you don't mean that.
Oh, right.
I'm in a real jokin' mood.
Now get out.
Becky You're not helpin', Mama.
Well, then I will just take a little break.
Ohh!
Mama!
Oh, honey, baby, I'm here.
One more push and we'll be there.
No, I can't.
You know I've never been real strict with you, but you have to.
No, I'll just carry this baby with me for the rest of my life.
No.
It's a bad look.
I can't, Mama.
I can't.
Listen.
Rebecca Devereaux, I think you must be about the bravest woman alive.
You do?
Honey, I couldn't do what you're doin'.
You've got courage I never had.
Why, you just decided how you wanted to have your baby, and you're doin' it.
I think that's wonderful.
I'm just so proud of you.
I just love you.
All right.
One more push, but that's it.
Attagirl, attagirl.
Come on, darlin'.
Ohh!
Oh, my God.
Oh, will you just look at him?
Mrs. Devereaux, that's the umbilical cord.
Oh.
Oh, oh, well, look at her.
Oh!
Look at this, Becky.
She's wonderful.
Oh, my gosh.
She's almost as beautiful as you were.
We did it, Mama.
We did it.
Honey, thank you for letting me be here with you.
I couldn't have done it without you.
The first time I ever held you in my arms, I knew I was holding somebody I was gonna love for the rest of my life.
Hello, little baby.
We've been waitin' for you.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Hi, Rose.
How's it going?
Hi, Blanche.
God, I hate morning people.
Ever since I've been a candy striper, I've been giving all my patients the traditional St. Olaf fun pack.
Each one has a pack of gum, a bar of soap and sock puppets.
I like to pretend one of 'em's you and one of 'em's Dorothy.
Hi, Dorothy.
How you feel?
Oh, woe is me.
I can't get a date.
Nobody asks me out.
Woe is me.
Woe - Bad puppet.
Dorothy, how's Sophia doing?
Oh, she's resting.
But a hernia is painful.
Well, honey, put your mind at ease.
The operation today is just a minor procedure.
And by the way, you have nothing to be guilty about.
What?
I don't feel guilty.
Oh, Dorothy, good God.
You were cleaning out the garage and you asked Sophia to move a sofa?
Don't start with me.
She is 84 years old, and you're asking her to do the work of two men?
It was wicker, all right?
And the La-Z-Boy?
Leave her alone.
I'm sure she feels bad enough.
Thank you, Rose.
Honey, do we have any orange juice?
Sure.
Would you like me to pour you a glass or have Sophia come in and bring you the refrigerator?
Enough.
Pussycat, I moved that safe to the attic like you asked me to.
Can I have food now?
Ma, you know I'm not giving you food, because you're not supposed to eat or drink anything the day of an operation.
I'm not going to any hospital.
Sophia, I'm working on the admitting desk.
Does that make it less scary?
Oh, sure.
In that case I'll get a boob job, too.
I'm not going.
People die there.
They go in, they don't come out.
Ma, that is not true.
I'm still not going.
Sophia, you have to go.
You can't just ignore your hernia.
Blanche is right.
Right now it's very minor.
But honey, left untreated, it could be very serious.
Honey, a trip to the hospital is the best thing for you.
You think I'm stupid?
This scam has "Shady Pines" written all over it.
Ma, be serious.
We're all adults here.
I see the way you've been eyeing my bedroom.
"Wouldn't a wet bar go great where the old lady is"?
Ma, that's ridiculous.
Why would I take you to Shady Pines when you have a hernia?
You took me there after I had a stroke.
I'm not getting anywhere.
Blanche, you talk to her.
A wet bar.
Blanche!
Look, Ma, I love you, and I know what's best for you.
And besides, I don't want to feel pangs of guilt for the next 20 years every time you say "Ow" just because I once asked you to move a sofa.
I guess I have no choice.
I'm in agony.
Did you hear that?
Agony, Dorothy.
Sophia, don't worry.
You made the right decision.
I was gonna give you this when you got to the hospital, but I'm too excited.
Here's your St. Olaf fun pack.
Thanks.
All right, I'm going.
Here, Dorothy, you throw this out.
I'll push the car around the front.
All right.
Let's see.
Who's next?
Uh, number 43?
Thank you.
OK, let's just fill out these forms.
Your name?
Brother Martin.
Occupation?
I'm a monk.
Oh, good.
I almost wrote down "Trekkie".
What brings you to the hospital, Brother Martin?
Well, I don't enjoy talking about it, but I hurt my knee dancing in my room.
Excuse me, but do I know you?
You look awfully familiar.
I get that a lot.
People say I look like Wilma Flintstone.
Not when she was on the air.
More the way she looks today.
No, no, no.
I-I can see that, too.
But you remind me of someone I used to know a long time ago.
I was cloistered in a small monastery in St. Olaf, Minnesota.
Where every spring the ducks return?
If we remember to throw out the corn.
You - You know it?
I know it very well.
I was born and raised in St. Olaf.
Well, this is extraordinary.
Did you know an Ingrid Kerclavaner?
You knew Ingrid?
She must have been 19.
She worked in the kitchen in the monastery.
Talked, talked, talked, talked.
That's all she ever did.
We were a silent order, so that was very refreshing.
I suppose it was.
Shortly after that, Ingrid died in childbirth.
You know the story?
Oh, yes.
Late one night a basket was left at the local orphanage containing hickory smoked cheese, spicy beefsticks, a baby and some kind of crackers that didn't go with anything.
Eventually, the Lindstroms took the baby.
And the beefsticks, 'cause that was the deal.
They named the baby Rose.
Did you know her - Rose Lindstrom?
Know her?
You're looking at her.
The Lord certainly works in mysterious ways.
What do you know about your father?
There was a rumor that he was a clown with Ringling Brothers, but I never believed it.
Just seemed too much to hope for.
Did you know him, too?
I've asked and I've asked.
I've never found anybody who could tell me about him.
Rose, I don't quite know how to put this, but I'm your father.
My father?
I can't believe it.
This really is the hospital.
Ma, you have a hernia.
Where'd you think I was taking you - Trampoline Village?
I told you, I thought you were taking me to Shady Pines.
I was beginning to look forward to the chicken Ã  la king.
You really think I was trying to deceive you?
Well, I was, but I don't anymore.
Now I think you're trying to kill me.
Ma, I know you're frightened, but do you think I would be pushing for this operation if I believed there was any risk?
I don't know, my little beneficiary.
Oh, God.
What's wrong, Blanche?
Oh, there's a very handsome doctor coming this way.
Dorothy, listen, if he walks by, just pretend we're having a conversation and casually mention my unparalleled ability to satisfy a man.
What, you don't think he's read the men's room wall?
Apparently not.
Wonder where Rose is?
She said she'd be here.
Oh, Rose, we've been waiting for you.
Ro-Ro-Rose?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I-I was distracted.
You're not going to believe it.
I just met my father, my natural father.
He's alive?
He's in Miami?
He's an earthling?
He just walked in.
He's a monk.
Must be a pretty reformed order.
Come on.
Let's get you signed in.
Are you sure you're up to this?
Maybe you'd rather talk.
Oh, I'm OK.
I can do this job without thinking.
OK.
Name?
Zulu, Queen of the Dwarf People.
Uh, Rose, I don't think you are up to this.
Now, where were we?
Name.
Rose Nylund.
No, no, no.
I'm fine.
Oh, here, Sophia, just sign this.
I'll fill it in later.
It's a standard consent form, releasing the hospital of responsibility.
Like if you're missing any jewelry or they kill you.
I'm not gettin' out of here alive.
Ma, will you calm down?
You are in the finest hospital in Florida.
Nothing is going to go wrong.
OK, Mrs. Petrillo, let's see if we can get you patched up, huh?
Here you go.
Thank you, Rose.
Why is a woman your age moving furniture?
For food.
Right this way.
You make me sick.
Oh, I am just so relieved that Ma came through that operation OK.
Yeah, she's a tough old woman.
Takes a lot more than someone like you to kill her.
Hi, Rose.
You going back to the hospital?
Yes.
I promised a friend I'd fill in for her tonight.
But it's the last place in the world I want to be.
Well, why, honey?
Because of my father.
How would you feel if you found out your father was a celibate monk?
It's not so unusual.
Look, Rose, we don't necessarily get the parents we want.
We get the ones we're dealt.
When I was a little kid, I got angry with my mother and father, and I imagined that I had different parents.
Who?
Who?
Well, it's really silly.
Come on.
Who?
Tell us.
Well, my dad was Errol Flynn and my mother was Amelia Earhart.
I wanted Dad all to myself.
You know who my fantasy parents were?
Who, Blanche, Masters and Johnson?
Not my fantasy neighbors.
No, my fantasy mother was the Queen of England, and then she died and I became queen.
And all the men were very happy for all the obvious reasons.
And I looked cute on the money.
'Course, all the women were unhappy, but screw 'em.
I was queen.
I never worried about who my fantasy parents were.
I only worried about who my real parents were.
Imagine, a monk who'd taken a vow of silence.
I mean, they made love, and he never even called her the next day.
Oh, Rose, I know you're disappointed.
But honey, confront your father.
Tell him how you feel.
At least you'll have some kind of relationship.
Right now you have nothing.
I'm luckier than you 'cause I had a father, a wonderful father whom I loved dearly.
But right now you have an opportunity I would give anything for - just to have ten minutes more with Big Daddy.
Oh, to hear that sweet old husky voice once more "They're admittin' who to my country club"?
Aw, there's a difference, Blanche.
That bigot was there for you.
Hello?
Yes, this is her daughter.
No, she's not here.
I-I left her with you.
I was told that she'd be in recovery till - Never mind!
I'm on my way!
What's the matter?
They've lost my mother!
Dorothy.
Wait up.
Will you wait a minute?
You just walk so fast.
I am in a hurry.
It's not sexy.
Well, it's not.
A woman should take little delicate steps as if to say, "Yes, I may be slower than you, but maybe I'm worth waitin' for".
It is the middle of the night.
My mother is missing.
I am scared to death and I'm trying to find a doctor.
You'll have to excuse me if I don't have the rolling gait of a nymphomaniac.
Well, now, look, Dorothy, I'm scared, too.
I'm terrified.
Sophia's practically my mother, too.
If we don't find her, I don't know how I'm gonna respond.
But I'd like to think I'm not gonna be any less sexy.
You're just a great big pile of estrogen, aren't you?
Oh, where is Dr. Warren?
This is insane.
Where do doctors go in the middle of the night?
Their call rooms are up on the 12th floor, but you have to take the back stairs to get to 'em.
Unless you have that special key for the main elevator.
I'm guessin'.
Where am I?
I must be dead.
Is this heaven?
Sal?
Is that you, Sal?
Sorry, ma'am.
Who's Sal?
My husband.
He's been waiting for me up here for a long time.
Boy, you're pretty young.
What brings a guy like you up here?
A lunatic.
I'm a police officer.
I was working a political rally at the Civic Center when this madman pulls out a revolver and starts blasting away from the roof.
I took a bullet pulling a baby carriage out of the line of fire.
How 'bout you?
Same.
Pardon me, but what are you doing in here all by yourself?
Who are you?
Are you an angel?
I'm the guy that shaves everybody.
Amazing.
That's not even mentioned in the Bible.
Heaven sure isn't what I expected.
Heaven?
Ma'am, you're on an elevator in a hospital.
You mean I'm alive?
Very much so.
Then what am I doing in here?
That's what I was asking.
Tell you what, ma'am.
I'll call Patient Care.
They'll send somebody.
This is our floor.
Good luck.
By the way, I'll be thinking of you.
Guys like you make it safe for old ladies like me to walk the streets.
I don't get the connection, ma'am, but thank you.
I'm glad you stopped by to visit me.
This is not a visit.
It's part of my job.
Far as I'm concerned, you're just another patient.
A monk with my nose.
Rose, I realize this is a lot to deal with all of a sudden.
You must have so many questions.
Just one, actually.
Will you be having the halibut or the chicken Kiev?
Boy, you're really angry, aren't you?
"Where has this louse been all these years"?
But I assure you, there's an explanation.
Halibut.
I'm sure there is.
I'll bet you're quite a smooth-talker.
I'm sure it wasn't the uniform that my mother fell for.
Broccoli or creamed corn?
Rose, you're terribly upset.
Corn, please.
I'm not upset.
I couldn't care less.
I guess I owe you an explanation.
You owe me a lot more than that.
Why didn't you ever come to visit me?
I stayed away because I thought my appearing out of nowhere would've been more than you could handle.
Shouldn't it be up to me to decide what I can and can't handle?
No, Rose.
Not up to me, either.
It's up to the man who brought us together today.
The intern in the paper shoes?
No, Rose.
The Lord Almighty.
All these years of wondering and-and hurting.
But now, by His bringing us together, I believe He's forgiven me.
My mother - did you love her?
Yes, very, very much.
But then the abbot found out.
Bud Abbott?
Sure'd be nice if you got one of these right.
No, Rose, the abbot.
He told me I had to choose between the church and your mother.
I chose God.
I think I have His forgiveness.
Now, more than anything, I'd like your forgiveness.
I don't know.
Lime Jell-O with pears or fresh lemon meringue pie?
Pie.
We don't have any.
We never did.
Now we're even.
Oh, any luck?
What?
Have you found her?
Yes, Blanche.
About a half-hour ago.
But now I've hidden her again, so you can find her.
The Dow was down again today.
I told my broker to short all my high-tech holdings and put it into triple-A bonds and precious metals.
Hey, you sound like doctors.
Do you think you can find out why I was left on this elevator?
You were just left here?
What's your name?
Read it yourself, right here on the bracelet.
"Zulu, Queen of the Dwarf People".
Petrillo's the name.
Sophia Petrillo.
Can you get me outta here?
OK, OK.
Who is your insurance company?
Lloyd's of London.
What do I look like?
I'm on Medicare.
We'll tell the desk.
They'll send somebody.
Oh, you're up.
Rose?
While you were sleeping, I've been thinking, and there's something I really have to know.
You said you chose God.
How could you do that when it meant giving up your own child?
I never knew there was a child.
It was only after you were living with the Lindstroms that I found out what happened to Ingrid.
By then, I didn't want to interfere with your new life.
I'm sorry.
You don't need to be sorry.
I In fact, I should thank you.
For what?
For giving me life.
Oh, and it's been a great one.
I mean, the Lindstroms were wonderful parents.
I had a wonderful husband, I have beautiful children.
And I owe it all to you.
I have grandchildren?
Yes.
And I'll bet they'd love to know you.
Oh, my.
So would I.  Rose, have you seen my mother?
Dad, these are my roommates Dorothy and Blanche.
Very pleased to meet you.
Hello there.
Rose has told me all about you two.
I know it's a little late for me to start acting like a father, but do you think you two could stop hitting my little girl with a newspaper?
We'll try.
We'll try.
You'll have to excuse us.
Rose, maybe you can help.
We're searching the whole hospital.
We can't find my mother.
Maybe she's lost.
Attagirl, Rose.
You finally got one.
Very nice meeting you, sir.
bye-bye.
Thanks, Dad.
Dorothy, you don't have to go through with this.
I never thought I'd be looking for my mother in the morgue.
Oh, I can't believe the last words I said to her were, "Shut up, Zulu".
I just wish it was me that was lost instead of Ma.
You'd be a lot easier to find.
Ma!
Oh, Ma.
We've been worried sick about you.
Easy.
Easy!
Easy.
Not healed.
Not healed!
Not healed.
Where've you been?
What are you doin' on this elevator?
I'm into easy listening.
How the hell should I know?
What difference does it make?
We found you.
Oh, what a day this has been.
I found my father.
You found your mother.
And I found you can't give a sponge bath without the patient's consent.
Ma, I'm so sorry about everything.
I'm sorry I asked you to move that sofa.
I'm sorry that you're sick.
I swear I'll never ask you to move furniture again.
Oh, God, I'm just so happy you're safe.
Speaking of God, I made a little promise that if He got me through this operation alive, I would tell you the truth about how I got this hernia.
You mean, not from lifting up the sofa?
Oh, please, it's wicker.
A few of us gals thought it would be funny to put Gladys' VW on the lawn while she was having her feet sanded.
And that's why I'm on this gurney, Pussycat.
Ma, it's OK.
As long as I found you.
Rose, push "Morgue".
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Mm, smells good.
Here, Pussycat, taste this.
Ooh!
Ma  "Bring to a near boil".
Perfect.
Ma, I could've burned my lips!
What are you doing?
My eyesight is going, so I like a prank I can hear.
Rose Nylund, what is that giant velvet painting of dogs playing poker doing out on my front lawn?
Intriguing passersby, if I know my art lovers.
And the clothes and the trunk and the boxes?
You're not havin' a yard sale, are you?
What's wrong with that?
Are you kidding?
I don't want to have to deal with trying to knock 25 cents off your "I lost my ass in Vegas" cup.
Is my cup out there?
I don't want to sell my cup.
Come on, Blanche, there's nothing wrong with Rose having a yard sale.
Right, Ma?
Here, Blanche, taste this.
Ma!
Look, Rose, I just hate the idea of a yard sale, but if you're really trying to get rid of your stuff, I'll take it off your hands for, say, $50.
OK, but a deal's a deal.
I don't want to hear you say you didn't get your money's worth just because something doesn't fit right or smells bad or makes strangers look at ya and giggle.
Good God, what do you have in those boxes?
As we say in St. Olaf, "crapola in a box".
Excuse me.
I can't stand her when she's feeling her oats.
Rose, you're a pretty sharp deal-maker.
We've all underestimated you.
Now, come over here.
Taste this.
Oh!
Ma, stop that!
Hi, it's me - Stan.
Stanley, what do you want?
Turn on your TV.
It is almost 6:28.
What's happening at 6:28?
You're gonna find out why Stan Zbornak is now a very rich man.
What is it this time, Stanley?
Whoopee cushions for the hearing impaired?
It's not a novelty.
It's a Zbornee.
What's a Zbornee?
I put up with it for 38 years, Rose.
You don't want to know.
It's not that, Dorothy.
I just used the same name.
So what is it, Stanley?
I'll show you.
It's time.
Let me turn it up.
Hi!
It's me - Stan Zbornak, and you may be wondering why I'm dressed like a potato.
That's what's different.
It's because I've invented the Zbornee, America's first baked-potato opener.
Now you can open potatoes without burning your fingers.
No!
It can't be done!
It can be done, and for only 12.95.
Over half a million Zbornees have already been sold.
Call this toll-free number now.
Remember, with the Zbornee,  a day without potatoes is unnecessary.
That's my line.
Hi, I'd like to order the Zbornee.
Rose, will you hang that up?
Times 500 thous- Stan, you're rich!
Oh!
Congratulations.
I know I called you a yutz in the past, but what I didn't tell you is that in Sicilian, "yutz" means "Apollo".
Ma, will you stop that?
It wouldn't hurt you to learn how to kiss up.
Stanley, one question.
If things are going so well, what is it you want?
Glad you asked, babe.
I need your help.
I want to export the Zbornee to Japan.
Our research shows the Japanese actually hate rice, but what they hate more is burning their fingers on baked potatoes.
Anyway, Dorothy, a major Japanese distributor is arriving next week.
Zbornco is throwing a big reception for him.
I need a date.
I want you to go with me.
I'm sorry, Stan.
There are other vegetables I'd rather go out with.
Dorothy, I need someone who's classy who can handle the rich and powerful.
Someone not too obviously sexy.
Why don't you ask Merv Griffin?
Dorothy, look.
I called every woman in my Rolodex.
I'm down to the "Z"s.
That means it's either you or my mother.
Frankly Mom chews too loud and still calls 'em "Japs".
What do you say, babe?
As they say in Japan, sayonara, Stanley.
That's another reason.
You know the language.
Hi, Blanche.
Rose, you know all that stuff you sold me?
That St. Olaf memorabilia and the things from your childhood?
A lifetime of memories.
Yeah, that's it.
Well, I came across these as I was tossing that junk in the dumpster.
That's a St. Olaf war bond.
Charlie bought us those in '42.
I didn't realize I still had those.
Wait a minute.
Are you telling me that St. Olaf printed its own war bonds?
Yes.
Oh, we were very patriotic.
In late '42, we wanted to fund the development of a top-secret weapon that we were sure would end the war.
Attack cows.
Take me now, Lord.
No one expects trouble from a cow.
The plan was, we would drop these highly trained killer cows behind the enemy lines.
It wasn't till they were airborne that we realized a cow can't pull a rip cord.
Well, the project wasn't a total failure.
If there's one thing the Germans hate, it's a mess.
Just tell me.
Is this damn bond worth anything?
Well, yes.
$1,000 - $1,000?
Well, hot damn!
I have 49 more of 'em.
We're rich!
You're half right.
Blanche, you just paid $50 for those.
You should split 'em.
Split 'em?
Are you kiddin'?
Don't be crazy.
I paid for these fair and square.
You said yourself, all deals are final.
Charlie would want me to have them.
George would want me to keep 'em.
Don't try that with me, Rose Nylund.
I'll match you dead husband for dead husband.
You are not going to believe this.
I told Stan I didn't want to go.
He sent me a kimono.
Do you know what I would look like in a kimono?
No.
I have no idea.
And listen to this.
"Dear Dorothy, in case you change your mind, "here are three things to remember at the cocktail party.
"Number one, ask for more potatoes.
"Number two, be appalled that Joe Isuzu wasn't played by an Asian actor.
"And number three, under no circumstances walk on their backs.
"Even if they beg you and they will.
"I hope you'll reconsider.
Have a potato day.
See you later, tater.
Your spuddy, Stan".
I can't believe it.
One beer.
One beer in high school, and my life is ruined.
He's trying to buy my love.
He's trying to buy my kid's love.
If I had a dollar for every time Stan has screwed up our lives Here you go, Pussycat.
Ma, where did you get that money?
Stan gave it to me.
Ma, he's trying to buy your love.
I'm sellin' it.
We cannot go on living like this with Blanche and Rose not speaking to each other.
So whatever the results of the secret ballot, we go with it.
No more arguments.
Agreed?
All right.
Yes, yes.
OK, here we go.
"Split the money".
"Let Blanche keep it".
"Give it to the old lady".
Yes!
"Split the money".
Well, Blanche, looks like the splits have it.
Big Daddy was right.
Women should not be allowed to vote.
If it's any consolation, when I wrote down "Give it to the old lady," I did mean you.
Hi, it's me - Stan.
Hi, Stan.
Come on in.
Oh, Stanley, how nice of you to stop by.
Bring me anything?
Of course.
Now, who's my gorgeous gray-haired gal?
It's me, isn't it, Stan?
You're right.
Wow, a Game Boy!
Very nice.
It sure is.
Who's your favorite fella?
Sophia, who's your favorite - Sophia.
Yeah, yeah.
Later.
Stanley, I want to talk about these gifts.
No need, babe.
Did you think the old stickman could hit the jackpot and not share with his very best used-to-be?
Let me show you something.
Come on.
Pour vous, mon ex.
Oh, a new convertible!
Oh, it's gorgeous.
Stan, I am not driving around with license plates that say "POTHEAD".
It's an abbreviation.
I didn't have room for the whole "potato head".
I don't want your car.
I don't want your money.
I don't even want to talk to you, much less go to that ridiculous reception.
So why don't you just take a hint and go away?
Just a minute, Dorothy.
I am sick and tired of being dumped on by you.
Yes, I screwed up our marriage.
We all know that.
But I wasn't a yutz for all of those years.
There were some good times before things went wrong.
Until I found out about them.
Old news, Dorothy.
This time I came up a winner.
Things have changed.
Hey, Stan, I'm her legal guardian.
We'll take the car.
Stanley, I think you'd better leave.
I thought I could make up for some mistakes, but you won't let me.
You have an image of what a Stan Zbornak is.
No matter how he's changed, you'll never see a new man.
Don't worry.
Won't bother you with any gifts anymore.
In fact, from now on, I won't bother you at all.
Hey, Stan, could I be "POTHEAD"?
Did you call St. Olaf?
What do we have to do to cash the bonds?
I'm not gonna beat around the bush.
I'm gonna tell you straight out.
Once upon a time, there was an ant and a grasshopper Oh, my God.
They're not gonna redeem the bonds.
Oh, they want to, but the city would have to liquidate all its assets.
St. Olaf would be bankrupt.
And this affects me how?
Don't you understand?
If we take that money, there won't be any left for the police cars and the fire trucks and the children's Cheese Museum.
You have a museum where children go to look at cheese?
Hey, it beats learning about it in the streets.
Oh, Sophia, no bingo tonight?
I'm staying home, trying to recapture my lost youth.
I see you haven't got it.
Today I saw something that shook up everything I ever believed in - Stan Zbornak with a backbone.
Oh, it really was a surprise.
It's Dorothy who has me worried.
She just looked so confused.
I can't figure out her problem.
I'm having a little trouble with that myself.
Pussycat, what's so terrible about accepting a present from Stan?
God knows he gave us all plenty of misery.
Maybe he's trying to tell you he's sorry.
I have to admit, Stan was pretty amazing today.
Did you see the way he stood up for himself?
This is not the same guy who screamed, "Paint my toenails!
We've just invaded Korea"!
It was kind of attractive.
Oh, but I don't know.
It's so hard to trust him.
I know what it's like to trust somebody who's betrayed you.
You're not gonna believe this, but I have a St. Olaf story about this.
I believe you.
I just hate you.
Well, Gunilla Bjorndunker, St. Olaf's tallest woman Of course, nobody ever made fun of her for that.
Anyway, when Old Space Needle was in high school she drank some cherry herring and made love in the backseat of a Fjord Fjairlane Local car.
Ah.
And she got in trouble, if you know what I mean, Dorothy.
Knukendup und schvingle.
She knows what you mean.
Anyway, her boyfriend, Yutz Hernsberg, St. Olaf's only bald high school student, had to marry her.
Why would she marry a guy like that?
Because I was young.
I I'm sorry - I'm sorry, Rose.
This is your story.
Go-Go on.
Go on.
Well, anyway, after 38 years of marriage and a painful divorce, he finally came back, having invented Hernsberg's Press-on Warts.
Who bought those?
Hags, mostly.
Don't you see?
He was successful and he wanted Gunilla back.
Well, what happened to her, Rose?
Skylab fell on her.
What is the point of this story?
!
Be thankful for your health.
This whole St. Olaf problem is my fault.
I can't believe I forgot I had those bonds.
How could I be so stupid?
Maybe it was something you ate.
Like food.
Oh, come on, honey, you're getting worked up over nothing.
I mean, Blanche is petty and selfish, but I don't think she would actually bankrupt a whole town.
God, I look good in diamonds.
Say hello to my four new best friends.
Hello.
They're just on loan from the jeweler until I decide which one I want to keep.
You know, the good thing about me is, although I am petite, I can carry a large stone.
Blanche, don't you even care about these people at all?
Of course I do, darling.
But just look at how these catch the light.
Oh, I just wish I knew the right thing to do.
You know, maybe you should sit down and think about the pros and cons.
Whenever I don't know what to do, I make a list.
I think making a pro-and-con list is a wonderful idea.
Here.
It'll help you know the right thing to do.
All right, let's see.
Pro, cashing the bonds.
I get stuff.
Con - St. Olaf, a small town, faces financial ruin.
Well, that doesn't help clear anything up.
Wait a minute, Blanche.
There's another con.
This is wrong.
Now, come on, we're family.
We always stick together.
We may not always get along, but we've always been there when we've needed each other.
Now, look.
This is important to Rose, and I think we need to stand behind her.
I mean, you're taking away a part of her, her home.
Granted, it's the cradle of idiocy.
I have a frog buried there.
All right, all right.
The bonds are in my safety-deposit box.
I'll give 'em to you this afternoon.
Blanche, thank you.
On behalf of the people of St. Olaf, I'd like to do a thank-you dance.
I'll need a pot and a sheet, a rubber band and a spoon.
Making a drum?
I guess you could.
Milk or lemon?
Scotch.
Forget it, Ma.
What are you saving me for?
OK, Rose, here they are.
Here are the bonds.
Dorothy, I want to thank you for helping me buy $25,000 worth of peace of mind.
Oh, Blanche, thank you.
I just got off the phone with the city fathers of St. Olaf, and it's been unanimously decided - they are going to build a statue to Blanche Devereaux right in the middle of Mrs. Olsen Square.
A statue.
Oh, my.
Is it going to be a big one?
Hey!
St. Olaf license plates don't say "Big Statue Country" for nothing.
Ooh!
Well, all right, that does it.
You're all my witnesses.
Oh, speech!
Speech!
Wait, wait.
Wait.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
If St. Olaf is flat broke, how are they going to pay for this statue?
Every penny comes out of the $500,000 Emergency Statue Fund.
$500,000?
Oh, but you can't touch that fund unless it's a real statue emergency.
I'm sorry, Blanche.
I've given you some really bad advice here.
Stanley, if you're here to beg me again to go to that reception, forget it.
Hey, Stanley Zbornak does not beg, OK?
I'm a man.
I have my self-respect, my dignity.
Then why are you here?
I need you to tie my tie.
Come on, Stanley.
I don't know how to do it, all right?
The Japanese are gonna be insulted if they think I already did my Sinatra impression.
Are you gonna help me or not?
This reminds me of the first time I ever did this.
Night of our senior prom.
Yeah, remember?
It took so long to get the tie fixed, by the time we got to the drugstore, it was closed.
I remember.
I remember.
God, Dorothy!
Remember our wedding day?
I made you do this even though you thought it'd be bad luck for me to see you before the ceremony.
What a silly superstition.
You know, Dorothy, all those years of marriage, through all the struggles, the one thing I wanted was to be a success.
Suddenly I have all the success I want, and it scares me.
I keep waiting for a knock at the door.
"Hi, it's me - Failure".
And I'm scared to face it alone.
What I'm trying to say is, I need your help Dorothy, like I did when we were together.
So, what do you think?
I hate to admit it, but you look good.
Well, wish me luck.
Uh, Stanley, why don't you come back here in about an hour?
Why?
It'll take me a while to get ready.
Oh, thank you, Dorothy.
Besides, I'll need someone to fasten my pearls.
Aw, babe.
The ones I gave you?
No, sweetheart.
The real ones.
Explain it to me again, Blanche.
Rose, look, if there's $500,000 in the statue fund, why can't they just take Because that's the statue money.
Well, there won't be anywhere to put the statue if there's no town left.
Wow.
A loophole!
Oh Hi, it's me - Dorothy and Stan.
Oh, hi.
How'd it go?
Ah, it was great.
Those Japanese sure know how to have fun.
What was that crazy dance called again?
They were bowing, Stanley.
Wild.
They were just wild.
They loved you, Dorothy.
No, they loved you, except, of course, for those Hirohito jokes.
Too soon?
Rose, do you think we can go call St. Olaf now, and you can explain it to them the way I explained it to you?
Well, we could try.
We might not be able to get a hold of anybody.
It's "Everybody Hide the Corn" day.
It was a perfect reception.
For once, everything was perfect.
It was you, babe.
You charmed them.
You were pretty impressive yourself.
You gave them a respectable soft sell and you made a deal that's gonna profit both sides.
You've come a long way Zbornee.
Thanks, babe.
Well, I I better be going.
It was a good evening.
Zbornak and Zbornak.
What a team.
Maybe we can do it again sometime.
Maybe.
Thanks, babe.
Dorothy.
Dorothy, you're gonna send me to an early grave.
Too late, Ma.
Good night.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" My heart!
My heart!
Everything has gone black.
I'm coming to you, Sallie.
Ma!
Oh, God!
Oh, God.
Oh, God!
Hang on, Ma!
Oh, please, please, hang on!
All right, but you have to do me a favor.
To the moon, Ma.
If you wanted a favor, you could just ask.
There are only two things I look forward to each day, and both of them involve yankin' a chain.
Has anybody seen Blanche?
She had a date last night, and this morning her bed's all made and she's not even there.
Wait a minute.
Here's our walking playground now.
Boy, it must be true love.
This guy is slowing down to 5 miles an hour.
Mornin', everybody.
Blanche, what is going on?
That guy's a little young, even for you.
What are you talkin' about?
He's a mature young man with his own business.
Now, who wants to help me pick out five magazines?
Blanche.
Please.
I'm in no mood for ridicule.
I've been going through a very tough time lately.
We're concerned, Blanche.
Jealous and concerned.
You haven't drowned yourself in young men since this time last year, when you brought those twins home from the Jimmy Smits look-alike contest.
Oh, yeah, Jorge and Esteban.
Romantic, passionate and virtually interchangeable.
Rose is right.
Every year at this time you start robbing the cra- Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute.
By any chance, does somebody have a birthday coming up?
All right, yes, damn it.
It's almost my birthday.
And I intend to forget all about it.
And if you are indeed my friends, you will forget about it, too, and never bring the sordid subject up again.
I know - I'm gonna give her a party!
You know, I actually feel sorry for Blanche Don't you, Ma?
Who's Ma?
Who are you?
Just ask the damn favor.
I need your help tonight for a charity.
I'm sorry, honey.
I have a date.
You call that a date?
Thyroid Freddie?
His eyes bug right out of his head.
He looks like he's being choked.
Now stop it.
Freddie is a fine man.
When he was younger, he could've been an astronaut, except for, well, you know, that eye thing.
I've been working for this Meals on Wheels program, and I need a driver.
Please?
Oh, all right, Ma.
I'll cancel Banjo Eyes.
Don't worry.
There'll be other dates, Gloria.
Ma, Gloria is my sister.
I'm Dorothy.
I know.
There'll be other dates for Gloria.
Yeah, I gotta agree with ya, Mrs. Ferguson.
Bobby Vinton is the king of rock-'n'-roll.
Ma, it's getting late.
Do you have to stay and visit with every one of them?
Excuse me for trying to get more involved in their lives.
That's fine, Ma, but did we really have to worm Mrs. Jenkins' dog?
Bup, bup, bup, bup.
I always just leave this one outside the door.
Really?
It's been that way since I took over the route.
OK.
This is Mrs. Taylor.
You'll get along with her just fine.
Two things - One, compliment her cat, and two, Jews control the planet.
Got it.
Oh, hi, Fluffy.
Lookin' good.
Ma.
Ma.
He's not old.
He's a perfectly healthy young man.
Just be home before midnight, Dorothy.
Excuse me, sir.
Go away.
Just a minute.
You're not old, you're not ill.
You're no slave to fashion.
Why are you taking this food?
Well, I'm hungry and I'm on the list.
Who do you think you are?
Sergeant Zbornak, Food Police.
Now, look, I don't want any trouble.
Just hand over that turkey loaf.
No, you can't.
I need this food.
Except for the carrot-raisin salad.
I've never understood carrot-raisin salad.
No, Mrs. Taylor, it's Flintstone, not Flintstein.
Lovely neighbors you got there, Mr?
No, no, no.
Get away!
Go over there.
Move!
OK, OK.
Take it easy.
Who's the macadamia?
So, uh, how you doin' today?
Uh, look, I don't understand.
You're obviously not handicapped.
Oh, I'm just as disabled as anyone here.
I find that very hard to believe.
You don't understand.
It's just too hard out there.
I haven't been out of this apartment in 22 years.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't know.
Enjoy your dinner.
How pathetic a person could live their life totally alone, devoid of companionship or love.
I wish I could do something.
Start a club.
Dorothy, how'd things go tonight?
I am so happy that I volunteered for Meals on Wheels, and I think I'm really making progress with Jimmy.
Although I could make more if Ma would stop yelling "Boo"!
You're really taking an interest in that man.
What happened to him, anyway?
The turmoil of the '60s just got to him.
The '60s were an emotional time for all of us.
I can still see Big Daddy sitting on the porch swing, swilling down home brew, picking off peaceniks with his BB gun.
Oh, God, I miss that man.
Come on, honey.
I'm sure Grand Dragon - I mean, uh Big Daddy is always with you.
Thank you.
You know, I can see why your friend got disillusioned, but I don't see why he withdrew for 22 years.
Oh, I can.
It happened to me.
When Stanley walked out, I was so devastated, I locked myself in my bedroom.
It was the one place that didn't remind me of Stan.
And I just never wanted to come out.
Fortunately, someone was there to get me out of that room.
Thanks, Ma.
Sure, Pussycat.
You know, Sophia, this birthday thing kinda has me depressed as well.
You think you could help me, too?
Sure.
No matter how bad things get, remember these sage words - you're old, you sag, get over it.
Sophia!
So what if you knew Jesus personally?
Wake up and smell the coffee, you fossil.
My mistake.
I thought since you looked like Yoda, you were also wise.
Here it is.
I needed to know when Blanche's real birthday was so I could throw her a party, so I got copies of her birth certificate, her DMV files Wait a minute.
Rose, that is an invasion of privacy.
What makes you think she wants a party?
Everybody wants a party, no matter what they say.
If you think we don't need to know Blanche's real age, maybe we should - Open the damn envelope.
I can't believe it.
After all these years, we're finally gonna know.
We're gonna know the true age of Blanche Devereaux.
"Deleted by authority of the governor".
Oh, they - These are all like that.
Rose, you know what this means?
Yeah.
She must have really jumped on this guy's bandwagon.
You almost got it, Rose.
Hello?
Jimmy.
It's me - Dorothy.
I'm fine, thanks.
What's new with you?
Oh, of course.
Nothing.
That's wonderful.
No, no, no, no.
I'll be right over.
I have done it.
A breakthrough.
Jimmy is tired of isolating.
Oh, that's great, Dorothy.
I don't think I like this whole situation, Pussycat.
Aw, come on, Ma.
I'm helping.
You're not a shrink.
Be careful.
Don't let your ego get involved.
My ego is not involved.
Look, I'm nobody special, Ma.
I'm just an average citizen.
I saw another citizen, and I reached out.
A man changed his life, and I'm just somebody who helped him do it.
Me, Dorothy Zbornak - miracle worker.
Who is it?
Jimmy, open the door.
Dorothy, I'm so glad you came.
Of course I came.
This is a big day for you.
It is.
I can't live like this anymore.
Oh, I am so happy.
I am, too.
Hey, let's celebrate.
Party time.
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind Jimmy.
Look, why don't we just save this as sort of a treat for later on, hmm?
'Cause first there's something I want you to do.
I want you to step out here, the way you do when you pick up your tray.
OK.
Now take another.
Come on.
Come on.
All right.
Now, how about one more?
That wasn't so hard.
How does it feel?
So many years inside, I forgot how much I love to travel.
You see, Jimmy, you put one foot in front of the other.
That's all it takes.
We're gonna get you out of here and to that counselor.
Oh, no, no.
We're not going to any counselor.
I thought you were tired of isolating.
Oh, I am.
Dorothy, you're the first person I've trusted in years, and you're absolutely wonderful, and I want you to live with me.
Live here?
Yeah.
All this can be yours.
All this?
Well, it does sweeten the pot, but Jimmy, I think you're missing the point.
You can name six of the Chicago Seven.
I love you.
Oh, don't say that.
David Dellinger.
Seven.
Take me.
Look, Jimmy, I like you, but not in that way.
Oh, great.
First person I reach out to in 22 years, and then you reject me.
Jimmy No, no, forget it.
Boy, you can't trust anybody.
I thought this place wasn't gonna be my prison anymore.
I thought for a second I remembered what "happy" was.
Well, thanks, Dorothy.
I'm never gonna leave this apartment again.
"Miracle worker".
I'm an idiot.
You have to stop beating yourself over the head with this.
Right.
You're not the one who made him drop out or the one who made him a recluse.
You're not the one who made him decide to live his life behind closed doors.
You're just the one who made it stick.
Don't worry, Dorothy.
Maybe Jimmy'll come around.
Oh, I wish I could believe you, but, Rose, I have been there.
After a while you feel you're just in this gigantic black hole.
We had a gigantic black hole back in St. Olaf.
Oh, God.
On Main Street, right in front of the courthouse where Charlie and I got our marriage license and our permit to have kids.
Oh, it was a lovely hole.
Everybody in town would stand around and look in it.
And they say Hollywood is the entertainment capital of the world.
Well, we didn't just look in it.
Sometimes we'd point, too.
Or spit and time it.
Then there was always that wise guy who'd have a couple of drinks and unzip himself and It's official.
I hate her.
Dorothy.
Ma, I just want to give him a call.
Pussycat, you're out of your league.
There are some people you just can't help.
It's like the Good Lord said - "You gotta know when to hold 'em.
Know when to fold 'em.
Know when to walk away".
Ma, that's not the Good Lord, that's Kenny Rogers.
God, Kenny Rogers.
Tomato, tomah-to.
The point is, there are others you can help.
All those people on our route - they depend on us.
You know, Ma, you're right.
I must say that helping always makes me feel better.
You wanna come, Rose?
Oh, no thanks.
I have to figure out which of the traditional St. Olaf party games to play at Blanche's party.
Party?
Is that why you've been sneaking around trying to find out my age?
A party?
I forbid it!
Blanche, a party is a celebration of life, and it's not just for you, but for your friends who love you.
No!
Stop being so vain.
You can't stay 42 forever.
Yes, you can if you eat right, exercise regularly and live with women who look a lot older than you.
Tell me, Rose, is "Kill the Bitch" a traditional St. Olaf party game?
I'm sorry, Mrs. Ferguson.
No, I didn't happen to see Ed Sullivan last night, but I'm sure it was a good one.
She's ready, God.
That bell is you, Fluffy.
Jimmy Jim-- Jimmy, I just want to make sure that you're OK.
Do I have to play hardball?
David Dellinger.
Don't do this to me.
Bobby Seale.
It's getting warm in here.
Tom Hayden.
Oh, God, you're good.
Abbie OK!
Just come on in here, you.
What do you want?
I don't understand you.
I see a perfectly healthy, intelligent person living like this - alone.
I'm not alone.
I've got my fish.
Fish don't reject you and fish don't judge you and fish - You gotta feed fish.
Jimmy, you deserve more.
Yeah, well, I thought I'd found it, but you dumped me.
Boy, I'll bet you've broken hundreds of hearts in your day, huh?
Thousands?
Well, yes, I have.
I mean, wherever you go, I bet you torment and tease and tantalize every man you meet.
You're right again.
Oh, come on, Jimmy, we're getting away from the point.
You are missing the point.
You are missing life.
You are missing people.
People who are happy, people who are in love, people who are towing my car away?
I'd loan you my Auto Club card, but it's really expired.
Maybe you're right.
Maybe I can't help.
You need professional help.
I hope someday you get it.
Don't you think I wanna go with you?
Dorothy, I look out that window, and I see the happy couples walking by, people walking into the supermarket.
God, you want me to get on a bus and go see a counselor?
I can't even shop for my own food.
What I wouldn't give just to make my own dinner once.
Actually, brunch is what I miss the most.
Aw, Jimmy, come on.
Let's take that extra step today and go to that supermarket.
You won't be sorry.
Jimmy, the world is filled with wonderful and exciting people.
I'll take your suggestion, Mrs. Taylor.
I'll play the Jackie Mason tapes at half speed, but I really don't think I'm gonna hear anything.
I can't do it, Dorothy.
Jimmy, you've come this far.
Do I have to?
Jimmy, you're at a crossroads.
The next step you take could be the most important one of your life.
Now, look, you trust me.
Jimmy, make that step.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Please.
Go.
Congratulations!
You're our one-millionth customer and winner of an all-expense paid trip to Mardi Gras!
Blanche, where have you been?
I've been out walking.
You know what today was?
It was my birthday.
Blanche Don't start your yammering.
It was one of the best birthdays I have ever had.
I did some soul-searching, and it occurred to me that I'm a vibrant energetic woman.
I must still have some life left in me if I can make Mel Bushman's head snap back like that.
You mean "Old Pez Head"?
You know, Rose, you were right.
What's in a number?
Why, I still have my health, I have my challenging career at the museum.
Most of all, I have you all - my family.
All that birthday nonsense was just an exercise in vanity.
And so today, for the very first time, Blanche Devereaux is gonna reveal her true and accurate age.
Right after you tell me your weight.
Coffee?
Please.
Dorothy, now calm down.
Oh, Ma, how can I?
Dorothy, what's wrong?
What's wrong?
I'll tell you what's wrong.
I single-handedly ruined a man's life today.
Which hand?
This hand.
What difference does it make what hand?
I ruined him.
I was in over my head.
I played with fire, and I lost.
Jimmy.
You forgot your sweater, Dorothy.
Come in.
How did you get here?
I walked.
Well, I'd like you to meet my roommates Rose and Blanche.
Hello.
Hi.
Would you like us to?
No, no.
I gotta start getting used to people.
Dorothy, you should know that when I got back to my place, I did some thinking - actually, I did some shaking and then I did some thinking - and I realized I was alone again.
After meeting you, I don't want to be alone anymore.
You're my friend, and if there's nice people like you out here, maybe the world's not such a bad place.
Thank you.
I know this isn't gonna be easy, but I want help.
Help and new clothes.
So, I'll go to a counselor if you'll drive me.
Drive you?
Are you kidding?
I'll listen to eight-tracks with you.
'Course, we'll have to use Rose's car.
Yeah, but whatever you want, Jimmy, I'm there for you.
I'm so glad this all worked out.
Come on in here.
I'll fix us some coffee.
Great idea, Blanche.
I think I can make it if I take it a little bit at a time.
Sure you can.
Surprise!
Ho!
Ho!
Ho!
I'm gonna kill you!
Rose, this is just a great party and the perfect gift.
How'd you know what I needed?
Oh, you.
Come here.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Blanche, would you mind coming over and actually doing something?
Well, Dorothy Zbornak, are you implying I'm not pullin' my weight?
That's between you and the laws of physics.
Come on, honey.
These are your father's things.
You should be helping.
The auction's less than a week away.
There's a lot to do.
It's just so hard for me.
Big Daddy's only been gone for a year.
Here I am, already selling off his things.
Oh, honey, it has to be done.
I know it.
I just didn't realize how seeing these things would bring back so many memories.
Like Big Daddy's Bible.
Never went anywhere without this.
Whiskey.
That explains why every Sunday after services, he'd stand up and yell, "I can lick any man in this church".
Huh.
Oh, Pussycat.
Just the person I was looking for.
I have a question for you, strictly hypothetical.
Let's say a man wants to take you out on a date.
Why is that hypothetical?
Check your calendar, Pussycat.
Uh, now, would you rather this man had looks, personality or money?
Personality.
Looks?
Money?
Why did you ask me that?
No reason.
Just wanted to get your honest opinion.
Here are the answers to that questionnaire.
Aha.
If Dorothy finds out I hired a matchmaker for her, she'll kill me.
Oh, I understand.
By the way, I'd like to change the answer on number ten.
I think a prison record does matter.
OK, but you just cut her chances in half.
Never mind.
Whatever you got.
Sophia, are you sure you know what you're doing?
Of course.
What do you think of a woman who cries herself to sleep every Saturday night because she's bored and lonely?
Your daughter does that?
I do that.
If you can fix Dorothy up with somebody, maybe I can get out of the house once in a while.
Or at least stay in and walk around naked.
Look, you better be goin'.
OK.
I'll call you tomorrow.
Oh, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
You forgot to answer the questions on the back.
And I still need a picture.
Would you settle for a thousand words?
No.
All right.
I'll get you a picture.
Now move, move.
Hey, that sign says "No soliciting".
Come back hereand I'll blow your head off, capisce?
I'll get it.
Pussycat, I have another hypothetical question.
Let's say a man is interested in you.
This isn't gonna stop until one of us dies, is it?
No.
Which of the following characteristics could you live with?
Body odor.
Schizophrenia.
Extra toes.
Ma, I couldn't live with any of those.
Look, I am perfectly capable of attracting a man who is charming, good looking and interested in personal hygiene.
Are you gonna take this seriously or not?
Blanche, are you all right?
I'm stunned.
I'm just stunned.
Honey, what's wrong?
That call.
It was Viola Watkins.
She used to be my mammy.
Your what?
My mammy - the woman who took care of me when I was little.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I don't think I ever heard anyone called "Mammy" before.
What about Mrs. Eisenhower?
"Mammy" Eisenhower.
I think only the Nixon kids got to call her that.
Anyway, Mammy says she's gonna be in town in a few days, and she wants to see me.
You don't sound very happy about it.
Didn't you like her?
Oh, I adored her.
She was like another mother to me.
In fact, she was the only friend I had.
I was a lonely child.
My sisters refused to play with me because I was so beautiful.
Do you know what that's like?
No, course you don't.
I loved her, and I thought she loved me.
And then one day, when I was ten years old, she left - no goodbyes, no explanation.
Just disappeared.
I was devastated.
We Southerners don't forget things like that.
It's true.
Possum is brain food.
You know, I had a nanny when I was a child.
She was my best friend.
I could tell her anything, and I'd know she'd keep it a secret.
Oh, we used to spend the days running and playing in the meadow.
Or playing hide-and-seek in the barn.
My nanny treated me just like I was her own kid.
Excuse me.
Is there anyone here who doesn't think she was talking about a goat?
Hi, Pussycat.
Gee, you look nice tonight.
Thank you.
But lean over here and smile.
I think you have something on your teeth.
Oh, really?
Ma, why did you do that?
Playboy is running a spread on the substitute teachers of Miami.
Oh, I'll get it.
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Blanche Devereaux.
Mammy?
Mammy Watkins?
Blanche?
I sure could use a hug.
Okey-dokey.
I was speakin' to Blanche.
Oh.
Dumplin'.
Um Mammy, I want you to meet my friends.
This is Dorothy Zbornak.
How do you do?
Nice to meet you.
And this is Rose Nylund.
We've met.
Won't you sit down?
Blanche, I wanted to tell you how sorry I was to hear of your father's passin'.
He was a wonderful, wonderful man.
Thank you.
As a matter of fact, that's really the reason I've come here.
Oh?
My friends in Atlanta read in the papers where you'd be sellin' off his things here in Miami, and before you did, there's something I'd like to ask you for.
The Bible?
No, thanks.
I don't drink.
There was a music box.
I gave it to your family, and I just can't bear the thought of a stranger buying it.
I'm afraid I'm in no position to bid for it myself, and I was hoping you could give it to me as a gift.
Let me get this right.
I don't hear from you for years and years, then out of the blue I get a phone call, and you come waltzing through that door and want me to give you a music box?
Oh, wait.
It's Mamie!
Just under the buzzer, Rose.
It was of great sentimental value, Blanche, I assure you.
It just so happens we haven't found any music box.
Yes, we have.
It's in that box - Shut up, Rose.
I'm sorry you wasted a whole trip out here, but we're not handin' out free gifts today.
Why don't you drop by again in another 30 years or so?
We'll see what we can do.
They grow up so quickly, don't they?
I had a wonderful time tonight, Jack.
Good.
So did I. You know, I don't ever go out on blind dates, but Ma was so insistent, and you sounded so nice on the phone.
I am nice.
They don't call 'em "correctional facilities" for nothin'.
And a sense of humor, too.
OK.
Boy, I bet we're both relieved Mrs. Contini did such a great job matching us up, huh?
I'll have to thank her in the morning.
Wait.
Could we back that up a second?
Who is Mrs. Contini?
What do you mean "matching us up"?
You know, Mrs. Contini, the matchmaker who brought us together.
I realize the process is hopelessly old-fashioned, but it's a lot more personal than those video-dating services, don't you think?
I'm afraid there's been a terrible mistake.
I think you'd better go.
W-Wait.
C-Can I see you again?
Probably not.
I will be at the Florida State Women's Prison.
The one in Jacksonville?
They used to come to our dances.
Why are you going there?
Murder.
Oh, you're gonna meet some great gals.
Hi, Pussycat.
Say goodbye, old woman.
Have a good time?
Do I sound like I had a good time?
How the hell should I know?
You're always like this.
Your matchmaker set me up with a criminal!
White-collar.
Ma, will you stop meddling in my life?
I am sick of it.
I told you, if I want a date, I can find one for myself.
Oh, Dorothy.
Dear, sweet, delusional Dorothy.
Blanche, if you don't mind, I'm having a heart-to-heart with my mother.
Now listen up, you withered old Sicilian monkey I don't have to take this.
Keep it up, and I'll take you to Shady Pines.
That's where I take you.
Ouch.
Guess I backed into that one.
Blanche, what do you want me to do with Big Daddy's encyclopedias?
Oh, put 'em with the Bible in the liquor cabinet.
What are you doin' here?
Blanche, I came here for more than just the music box.
It was wonderful to see you after all these years.
You are still my little dumplin'.
That's all very sweet, but you're not getting the music box.
Now, if you will please excuse me.
Blanche Marie Hollingsworth, sit down.
I'm not a little girl anymore.
You can't tell me - I said sit!
Now, Blanche, that music box is a lot more important to me than you can possibly know.
I didn't give it to your family.
I gave it to your father.
It was a special gift.
I don't understand.
Blanche, I loved your father.
Of course you did.
Everybody loved Big Daddy.
No, I mean I loved your father.
Get outta here.
We were lovers, Blanche.
That's impossible.
Big Daddy was a Republican.
These are letters he wrote me.
They're personal.
I wouldn't normally have another person read them, but they explain everything better than I ever could.
I'm sorry, Blanche.
I know this comes as a surprise.
Look, Blanche.
Oh, hi.
I found this picture of your mother and father.
What do you want me to do with it?
Mrs. Zbornak.
Mrs. Petrillo.
Oh, good.
You two are talking.
We're not talking.
I'm still furious with Ma for hooking me up with that matchmaker.
That reminds me of a story about St. Olaf's most famous matchmaker.
Oh, please, Rose, spare me the endless inane details of how Heidi Flugendugelgurgenplotz successfully matched a bull with a duck.
And how their daughter was a bull duck who ran a small tattoo parlor in Carmel.
Honey, what's the matter?
I just found out that Mammy Watkins and Big Daddy had an affair.
They were lovers.
For over 50 years.
And we can't even get anybody to do our windows.
Honey, are you sure?
Yes.
Mammy Watkins gave me these letters Big Daddy wrote to her.
"I'd swim across many oceans "for a glimpse of your face.
"I'd climb the tallest mountains "for the sound of your voice.
I'd walk a million miles for one of your smiles".
Seems authentic.
I just can't get over it.
Over what?
San Juan Hill, Rose.
Over the fact that her father had an affair with her mammy.
I don't know what to think.
This changes everything I ever thought about Big Daddy.
I always assumed that he and Mama had a wonderful sex life.
I walked in on 'em once when I was a little girl.
There was all this huffin' and puffin' and high-pitched sounds.
Then suddenly Big Daddy shouted "Glory"!
and they both lit up cigarettes.
I vowed then and there I would never do anything so repulsive.
So what happened?
Oh, Bobby Joe Porter explained to me that the cigarette part was optional.
Remember that one time you walked in on me, Dorothy?
Oh, yeah.
I still remember what you said.
"Mommy's sick.
Get help".
I would have died if I'd ever caught my parents having sex.
You never walked in on them?
Once, but they were only playing leapfrog.
Have you seen Blanche?
I think she's in her room.
Why?
I really need to talk to her.
Every time you need to talk to somebody, you go to your mother or to Blanche.
Why doesn't anybody ever talk to me?
Your advice always comes with one of those damn St. Olaf stories.
I can give advice without a damn St. Olaf story.
Now, what's wrong?
Well, I just don't think it was right of Ma to hire that matchmaker behind my back.
Now, why does she always meddle in my life?
Dorothy, I recently read about a man in Paris, France named Frudensteufer - Rose Pierre Frudensteufer.
He worked in his father's herring - no, quiche factory, and his father Lars Fr- Do I look like I just fell off the turnip truck?
No.
But you do look like the woman who used to drive it.
Her name was Uma Van Hefflan.
No relation.
Although she, too, collected string.
Well, one day - Rose, stop yourself.
You're doing two of them at the same time.
I know, and I'd like to try to handle it.
I feel like Hans the Plate Spinner.
Funny thing about - Rose!
Oh, my God, Dorothy.
I need help.
Rose, you're headed for a meltdown.
Now make a point, any point.
The point of the story - actually, two of the stories - is that you let your pride get in the way too often.
The only reason your mother did what she did was she didn't want you to be lonely.
When you think about it, the idea of a matchmaker is kinda sweet.
Dorothy, can we talk?
I just want you to understand why I did what I did.
Pussycat, I realize I was wrong by not talking to you before hiring a matchmaker, but what you don't understand is where I come from, matchmaking is an age-old tradition.
For centuries, people have been happy being brought together by a third party.
Ma, I understand.
I-I really appreciate what you're trying to do.
Good.
And in keeping with that spirit, I sold you to the sultan of Fatah.
Ma.
What?
You're a substitute teacher.
It'll be just like The King and I. Ma, why do you do this?
I want you to be happy.
I am happy.
Look, Ma, I know that you think there's something missing from my life, but there isn't.
If the right person comes along, great, but I don't need a man to be happy.
I didn't realize that about you.
On Mrs. Contini's questionnaire, there's a box about that.
Anybody for barbecued chicken?
Oh, I'm afraid we're out of charcoal, honey.
Who needs charcoal?
That's what these letters are for.
Now, if I can just find that music box, we'll have us a big ol' fire.
Blanche, what are you doing?
I certainly can't let Mammy Watkins have these things.
That'd be just like giving my consent to what happened.
For my sake and my mama's, I cannot do that.
Blanche, your father obviously loved this woman.
You loved this woman.
I think you'll feel a lot better if you talk to her.
All right, I'll talk to her, but I can't promise anything else.
I once wrote some letters to my nanny.
We know, Rose.
She ate them.
Thank you for coming.
I'm glad you called.
Please, sit down.
Well, this has been very difficult for me, but I want you to know I forgive you.
I don't need your forgiveness.
I'm not ashamed of anything I've done.
Blanche, your father and I were in love.
We didn't mean for it to happen, but it did.
In another time and place, we would have been married, but at that time in the South, it wasn't an option.
And it wasn't only physical, either.
You just don't go through what Curtis and I went through just for sex.
Although that was reason enough.
Blanche, did I shock you?
Yes.
I've never heard anybody call Big Daddy by his first name before.
He was the only man I ever loved, and now he's gone.
I'd like to have the music box.
No.
Fine.
Oh, yeah, that's right.
Walk out, just like the last time.
What are you talkin' about?
You didn't even say goodbye.
I woke up one morning, and you were gone.
I loved you.
I spent the next few years wondering what I'd done, what I'd said to make you leave me.
So that's what this is all about?
Honey, you didn't do anything wrong.
I had to leave that night because your mother found out about your father and me.
Well, you don't love a little girl for ten years and then just walk out of her life!
Aw, face it.
You didn't care.
Did you or did you not wear your very first formal - white with pink trim - to the junior prom?
And did you not come home wearin' a football jersey?
It was dark in that hay loft.
Your father and I spent many an hour trying to figure out what to do with you.
You drove that man to distraction.
Maybe you talked about me, but that's not the same thing as bein' there.
I know that.
I remember a wedding reception early one June when the most beautiful bride I'd ever seen danced with her equally handsome father.
You were there?
The song was "Tennessee Waltz," and you asked the band to play it twice so you could dance with your daddy as long as possible.
I stood in the back with the caterers so no one would notice.
You don't know how much I wanted to hug you.
I just had to see my dumplin' on her weddin' day.
Here.
I think Big Daddy would want you - I want you to have this.
Blanche, I don't know what to say.
This isn't the right music box.
That's the only music box there is.
The music box I gave your father was black enamel and played "Stardust".
Theme from Bonanza.
Well, then, I guess we went through all this for nothin'.
I wouldn't say for nothin'.
Then who the hell gave him this music box?
Hmm.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Blanche, I'm trying to decide what to get Dorothy for her birthday.
What do you think about this?
"Good looking single white male seeks fun times on a regular basis".
Well, it's something she doesn't have.
Hi.
Dorothy, you're home from school.
Aw, Ma, do you realize you've said the same thing to me just that way ever since I was in the third grade.
It's sweet.
It's not sweet, it's pathetic.
off anywhere.
Get a life!
So did you teach anybody anything today?
Well, I tried but it seems none of the kids are interested in learning how to diagram sentences.
I really don't get it.
Am I the only one who thinks diagramming sentences is fun?
You talk like this on dates, don't you?
Dorothy, you're a substitute.
Your job isn't actually to teach.
Then what is it?
To keep the kids from burning the school down before the other teacher gets back.
No, normally, you'd be right.
But this class knows that I'm filling in for the whole semester.
I must say it's really nice having the same class every day and watching them grow and learn.
And of course, they're not trying any of that usual substitute shenanigans.
Is that "kick me hard" sign a fashion statement?
Another one?
Oh, no, this isn't what you think.
No, this isn't because I'm a substitute.
This is because I am flunking the star of the football team, and he's not gonna be able to play on Saturday.
Oh, what a relief.
I thought you were the brunt of a joke.
Turns out they really hate you.
Dorothy, why don't you pass the kid so he can play?
I doubt if The Canterbury Tales is gonna come up in a huddle.
I agree, Dorothy.
Saturday's game is a big one.
And speaking as a former cheerleader and ex-bad girl in a health film, I can tell you the importance of school-sanctioned extracurricular activities.
Now, look, I want you both to know that I don't enjoy failing anybody.
Especially this kid.
But he's lazy.
In his book report on A Tale of TwoCities, he said he liked them both, but he really prefers Minneapolis, 'cause that's where Prince is from.
Hi, Rose.
Oh, hi, honey.
Rose?
Honey?
Is something the matter?
I just got back from having my teeth worked on.
Oh, what was it, a wisdom tooth?
My dentist touched me.
I think he felt my breast.
Oh, Rose, that's terrible.
What happened?
Well, when the nitrous oxide wore off, and my head began to clear, Lou, that's my dentist, said he was checking my heartbeat, but I think he was up to more than that.
Well, why, Rose?
I mean, what gave you that idea?
I don't think "wowee-wow-wow-wow" is a medical term.
How could he do a thing like that?
Believe me, just because men in the medical profession wear white, does not mean that they're angels.
He did something horrible and unethical, and he has to answer for it.
We are gonna find out who the proper authorities are, and you're gonna lodge a formal complaint.
I wish men would have breasts just for one day.
Then they'd know what it's like to be judged by some physical trait.
I mean, just because I'm built like this, you wouldn't believe how many people think I'm dumb.
Rose, you're too hard on yourself.
I know people who think you're dumb over the phone.
Doorbell!
Doorbell!
Ma, what is the matter with you?
Can't you answer the door?
My butt's asleep, and you know, I'm kinda gettin' into it.
Hi, Zbornak.
We need to talk.
Yeah, come in, Coach.
Ma, this is Nick Odlivak, the football coach.
I never thought I'd say this, Dorothy, but I think you can do better.
Coach, let me save you a speech.
Kevin deserves an F, and that's what he's getting.
In all the years I've been at St. Sebastian Kevin Kelly's the best athlete I've ever coached.
For the very first time, we got a genuine shot at taking state.
With Kevin playing, we can win that game in our sleep.
My butt's asleep.
We don't get much company.
Look, that's my decision.
Goodbye, Coach.
All right, all right, all right.
I'll tell you what.
I'll sweeten the pot.
You let Kevin play this weekend, and I'll take you out Saturday night.
You haven't read The Art of theDeal, have you, Coach?
Do I smell aftershave?
The coach was here, trying to get me to compromise my principles.
I don't see what the big deal is about passing this boy.
Why, in my neck of the woods, they practically gave grades away.
Blanche, in your neck of the woods, men named Bubba get into law school.
Look, Blanche, it's time that somebody took a stand.
I mean, it's time that somebody made a difference in Kevin's life.
Oh, Rose.
Honey, did you make the call?
Blanche, I appreciate you giving me the dental examiner's number, but when I thought about actually filing a report Rose, people like your dentist count on their victims to back down.
Honey, you have to have courage.
Rose, this is not unusual.
In most cases when a person is molested, it's by a friend or a relative.
Someone they know.
But there are other considerations.
What if I were wrong?
The last time I had courage, I confronted Lukan Ulfnooner, St. Olaf's moodiest plastic surgeon.
Thank you very much, Rose.
That was a great story.
Nice try, Dorothy.
Anyway, Doctor Ulfnooner did some work on my mom.
And do you know who she came out looking like?
Raymond Massey.
Rose, that's terrible.
That's what I thought when I accused him of malpractice and ruined his business.
Unfortunately, little did I know Know what, Rose?
That was the look she was going for.
Rose, just because you had one bad experience doesn't mean you shouldn't confront Dr. Norgan.
Now, you were taken advantage of.
Blanche, I was groggy.
And I'm not 100% sure he did it.
And as far as being taken advantage of, look who's talking.
I beg your pardon.
Why, when I submit to a man's advances, it is with my consent.
A woman has the option to say no.
Honey, you weren't given that option.
You were given nitrous oxide!
By the way, Blanche, when did you ever say no?
Did I say there was going to be a question and answer period after I spoke?
Oh, Sophia.
Thank you, honey.
How perfectly lovely.
Well, I was boiling water anyway to shrink the cyst on my backside.
I figured, "What the hell?
I'll throw in a tea bag and make myself a hero".
Ah, Father O'Mara, this is a surprise.
Hello, Dorothy.
May I come in?
Well, of course you may.
Please, come in.
Ma, Blanche, this is Father O'Mara, St. Sebastian's Dean of Boys.
Father, this is my mother, Sophia Petrillo, my roommate, Blanche Devereaux.
Hello.
Blanche Devereaux?
I've heard quite a bit about you.
All good, I hope.
I'm sorry, I can't reveal things learned in confession.
But it's nice to match the name up with a face.
Father, won't you sit down?
And would you like something to drink?
Tea would be lovely, if it's no trouble.
No, not at all.
I already had some boiling water on account of this cyst on my bottom.
Ma!
Dorothy, as you're already eminently aware, St. Sebastian's has a very big football game on Saturday.
Father, I would think that you, of all people, would have higher ideals.
The highest.
What I'm trying to say to you, Dorothy, is I truly believe that He would want Kevin to play Saturday.
Really?
I had no idea that He took such an interest in high school football.
Oh, yes.
He likes all sports.
Even gymnastics.
And I'm told you're quite the gymnast.
Oops.
Father, I could really use the support of the administration on this.
I'm thinking of the school as a whole, Dorothy.
I'm thinking of the community.
I'm thinking about Kevin.
Well, if there's nothing I can say to change your mind But I feel I should inform you that we have an active and vocal alumni and I can't be responsible for their actions.
Is that a threat?
More like a concern.
I appreciate your concern, Father, but I'm sticking to my decision.
Ma, what is it now?
You threw a priest out of the house.
You disgust me.
I'm gonna go sit in my tea.
Ma, what are you doing?
I can't believe I have a daughter who threw a priest out the door.
Ma, you have relatives who threw priests out of windows.
That was business.
Dorothy, somebody left this package for you outside on the front porch.
Oh?
What is it?
A fish wrapped in newspaper.
Oh, my God!
Dorothy, you know what this means?
White wine with dinner?
Do I look like I'm laughing?
Here, read this note.
"If Kevin Kelly doesn't play in Saturday's game, Dorothy Z. sleeps with the fishes".
Dorothy, please, give the kid a "D".
Oh, come on, Ma, it's just a prank.
Dorothy, I don't think you realize the significance of football in the South.
I've had men break dates with me to go to football games.
Oh, come on.
Nobody's going to kill me over a high school football game.
They killed this fish.
Dorothy, please.
I'm scared.
All right.
All right, Ma.
Nothing to be scared about.
I'll change Kevin's grade.
I mean, this isn't worth it.
I can't put my family through this.
I thought I could make a difference.
I can't.
They win.
Thank you, Dorothy.
That makes me feel better.
That's good, Ma.
Dorothy, can we have a big-screen TV?
No.
Dorothy, please.
I'm scared.
What's going on?
Oh, Blanche is telling me about Freud.
Why you asking her?
I'm the one who slept with him.
Sophia, this is serious, honey.
According to this book, if Rose doesn't confront Dr. Norgan, she could take her hostilities out on us.
Tunnels.
He loved to drive through tunnels.
Cheesecake.
Good idea.
Now we can be old and fat.
Let me handle this.
Rose, you obviously had a very traumatic childhood.
I need to hear your whole life.
I want you to start at the beginning and tell me your first memory.
Ma, I'm sorry.
I didn't want your last days to be like this.
Close your eyes and think back.
What do you see?
A cow.
A chicken, a goat, a lamb, a rooster no, two roosters.
A pig.
There's a man with a gun.
He lifts the gun up into the air.
He shoots it and they're off.
The pig takes the lead, the chicken is in second place, the roosters are neck and neck, right on the tail of the chicken.
They're going down the back stretch Rose, Rose, Rose.
Before the menagerie rounds the clubhouse turn, you have to make the decision to confront Dr. Norgan.
You can't keep something like this bottled up inside.
You're not alone.
I have trouble confronting people.
Yeah, right, Ma.
Like just the other day when you made the butcher cry.
The man wouldn't trim the fat.
What choice did I have?
When somebody does something wrong and it violates you, you should tell them about it.
She's right.
It's not easy living with yourself when you haven't stood up for what you believe in.
I know.
I backed down myself today.
I guess I have to go and talk to him.
You'll feel better.
I'll go.
Thank you, Blanche.
All of you.
Oh, Blanche, you did a pretty good job focusing this for Rose.
And for me.
I have to admit, you would have made a very good psychologist.
Great idea, Pussycat.
Give Blanche an office with a couch and a license to charge by the hour.
Doorbell.
Morning, Ms. Zbornak.
Can we come in?
Well, I don't know, Kevin.
Can you?
Uh, may we come in?
Yes, of course.
Please come right in.
I don't know what just happened here, but it didn't sound like it deserved an F. It's because Kevin is not an F student.
Look, it's not that I'm lazy, Ms. Zbornak.
I'm just really busy with ball.
I wanted to read The Tale of Two Cities, but I didn't have the time.
That was my fault, Kevin - for interrupting the high school experience with a book.
Hey, you didn't know.
Kevin, what're you gonna do when you're out in the world competing with young men who have applied themselves?
Like Ralph Zaldin.
You know, the boy whose underpants you turned into a hat yesterday after school?
Yeah, well, I'm sorry, Ms. Zbornak, but Ralph Zaldin's a geek.
Oh, a student pays attention, works hard, gets good grades.
Does that make him a geek?
No, that makes him a dork.
A geek is more like, you know, somebody with no friends, stays home every Saturday night, nose always buried in a book.
One word out of you and I cut off your supply of Metamucil.
Look, Kevin, the reason you're in this trouble is because you have not been working up to your ability.
I'll tell you what: if you can spare me two evenings a week, I'll give you an incomplete in English and tutor you privately until you can pass the whole course.
That way you'll be eligible to play tomorrow.
Fine.
Fine.
Well, as soon as football season's over.
Young man, she is doing you a favor.
She's taking time from her busy schedule They don't know you have no life.
Kevin, no dice.
You take it or leave it.
These are my terms.
Look, Coach, you told me if I was nice to her, she'd roll over.
I'm outta here.
If you wanna win tomorrow, it's up to you.
Kevin!
Life gets tougher outside of the Driver's Ed.
car, doesn't it, Coach?
Zbornak, I'll do whatever I have to do to make sure that Kevin plays in that game.
If you don't want to make it easy on us, fine.
But you're not gonna stop us.
I guarantee you, that boy will be playing.
Well, at least I stood up for my principles.
This is the proudest I've been of you in my whole life.
Thanks, Ma.
Can you believe it?
My whole life and this is the proudest I've ever been.
I'm depressed.
I need a cookie.
Hello, Rose.
Hello.
Well, let's get to work.
Hop in the chair.
Look, Dr. Norgan Hey, what's this "Dr. Norgan"?
What happened to "Lou"?
All right.
Lou There's something I have to talk to you about.
Great.
We'll talk while I work.
Come on, sit.
I, uh Here we go.
I'll do that.
Now, Rose, what is it that you wanted to talk to me about?
Well, I  Now, Rose, don't be ridiculous.
You can feel free to discuss any subject with me.
Certainly I remember our last appointment.
Bill's already in the mail.
No, there was nothing out of the ordinary about the procedure.
I put in a temp, and now you are ready for a crown.
I'm not talking about the procedure.
I'm sorry, I didn't get that.
You touched me.
You fondled me.
Didn't you?
Rose, this happens to dentists all the time.
A side effect of the anesthesia can be hallucinations, fantasy.
It's like a dream.
I probably brushed up against you and in your woozy state I am so sorry.
It's all right, Rose.
Well, listen, what do you say we take a look at that crown.
Oh, you must hate me.
Rose, I don't hate you.
You're a friend.
A nice person.
I look forward to our times together.
You truly are a considerate, compassionate, understanding woman.
Lovely woman.
Delicate.
Innocent.
Enchanting.
Wowee-wow-wow-wow.
Oh!
Stand back.
I'm not afraid to use this.
Rose, what are you doing?
Oh, darn you!
I believed you.
I even apologized to you.
Rose, I forgot myself.
It will never happen again.
You're damn right it won't happen again.
Not to me or to anybody else.
I'm reporting you to the State Dental Board.
Rose!
One more thing before I go.
What?
Dance.
Come in.
Oh, no.
You're not a substitute nurse too, are you?
I'm sorry about your knee.
You know, you wouldn't have been blindsided if you'd stayed in the pocket.
You know football?
I know everything.
Ah, I see some people have already signed your cast.
Uh, yeah.
Some of the guys from the team.
Uh, are you signing it?
Correcting it.
There is no K in victory.
Oh, yeah, and we'll just change this to: "Ms. Zbornak eats shiitake mushrooms".
Listen, if you're feeling guilty about not influencing my life, don't.
People have been trying to get me to be serious for years.
We made a deal.
You promised me that I could tutor you once football season was over, and it looks like it is.
Yeah, but this isn't exactly fair.
I can't move.
I know.
I know.
It'll be like teaching fish in a barrel.
Shall I begin?
Do I have a choice?
Well, you could push the call button, but I'll be done with the book by the time the nurse gets here.
So, "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times".
Good stuff, huh?
"It was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness.
"It was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity.
It was the season of Light"
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Oh, Ma, did you eat all this candy?
I was lookin' for the prize.
Prizes are in Cracker Jacks.
Boy, you forget something new every day, don't you?
Card says these are for me.
They're from Stanley.
"Roses are red, violets are blue.
I hope you enjoy this candy.
It cost me 42".
You know - and I'm guessing here - I'll bet you that Stan wrote this himself.
But it's sweet.
Yeah, real sweet.
What's that supposed to mean?
Ever since he made a fortune on that baked potato opener, he's been comin' on to you like gangbusters, and I don't like it.
Not that I've ever actually seen gangbusters But I did see Ghostbusters.
I didn't like that, either.
I mean, they couldn't give the black guy one funny line?
And how about that sequel?
Dorothy, what the hell were we just talkin' about?
Look, Ma, Stan and I have a long history together, and it's nice that we're finally able to talk to each other as friends.
Friends are one thing, but he's your ex-husband, and you're givin' him the wrong idea.
That's bad news.
I don't want to hear any more about this.
You and I can argue till the cows come home.
We're home.
Oh, what a day.
I wasn't able to get any work done today because of that new girl Abby.
I mean, she's constantly talking to me all day long.
And she never listens to me.
Do you know what it's like to be totally ignored?
So how was your day, Rose?
The truth is, she's a sweet girl looking for a friend.
And we do have a common bond.
She used to be a newscaster.
Now she's just an assistant like me.
So there's this cognitive dissonance between her actual and her ideal self which causes her to be practically dysfunctional.
But of course, I'm no psychologist.
No, you're a nitwit.
How come you know those words?
Blanche, come on, it's not nice calling her a nitwit.
But since the cat's out of the bag How do you know those words?
I guess it's from reading The American Journal of Abnormal Psychology.
It's published in St. Olaf, you know.
In fact, my Uncle Gunther used to be the editor.
And what were you, the centerfold?
I'm sorry, but I refuse to believe you have ever read a scientific journal.
Believe what you want.
See if I care.
Hypersexual bitch.
Oh, there you are, Rose.
Good.
Honey, I'm borrowing your earrings to go with this new outfit of mine.
Tell me I look stunning.
You look stunning.
You're not just saying that.
No, I'm just repeating it.
Blanche, I need to talk to you.
Oh, OK.
It's about a friend of mine.
I think she's taking advantage of me, and I don't know how to tell her.
It's as if she doesn't care about my needs just 'cause she's a lot younger than I am.
Fine.
Keep your damned earrings.
Oh, no.
No, Blanche, not you.
Abby.
Oh, right.
I was thrown by the "she's a lot younger than you" part.
So what should I do?
Say something to her.
Tell her you have to get something off your chest and put your foot down.
That girl thinks only of herself.
You're right.
Put my foot down.
Get it off my chest.
Hi, Rose.
Where you goin'?
Dorothy, I'm going to get something off my foot.
Good for you, Rose.
Careful of the carpet.
Blanche, I need to talk to you privately.
OK.
There's this person, someone I've known for quite a while, and lately there seems to be this attraction developing, an attraction I've been trying to deny.
Blanche, what are you doing?
It's a curse.
My beauty's always been a curse.
I'm sorry, Dorothy, but like the fatal blossom of the graceful jimson weed, I entice with my fragrance but can provide no succor.
I'm talking about Stanley, you idiot.
Get outta here.
Stan has the hots for me?
For me, not you, fatal blossom.
For me.
We went for a walk this morning on the beach, and he told me.
Dorothy, this came for you.
Ah?
Ah, it's from Stan.
It's steaks.
He sent me steaks.
He still has the wrong idea about you two?
Ma, it's nothing.
Dorothy, the man sent you meat.
Oh, I don't know.
I don't know.
I mean, I really do want Stan as a friend, but just as a friend.
What was that lip lock you had on him the other night?
What's this?
Oh, it's nothing.
I gave him a little kiss.
Trust me, that was no little kiss.
That was more like a dental checkup.
Your whole head was practically in his mouth.
All right, Ma.
All right.
"A little kiss," she says.
The man almost digested her.
It was like watching a Nova special.
Oh, all right.
When Stan comes over tonight, I'll talk to him.
I'll apologize to him for leading him on.
I only hope I don't hurt his feelings.
Well, there are worse things in this world than hurt feelings, Dorothy.
That's true, Pussycat.
As we say back in Sicily, sticks and stones can break your bones, but cement pays homage to tradition.
All right, Dorothy, I think it would be a good idea if we rehearsed how you're gonna break up with Stan tonight.
OK, I'll be Stan.
I didn't know you were dating Stan.
I am not, and I don't need to rehearse.
Oh, I think it's a good idea, Dorothy.
If you like, I'll be Stan.
Beat it.
I already got dibs on Stan.
You be Dorothy.
Don't be stupid.
Besides, Rose ought to be Dorothy.
No, thanks.
But I'll play Stan.
Well, I'm not playing Dorothy, although playing a sap on stilts would be a cakewalk.
No offense, Pussycat.
None taken, you cankerous little prune.
Hi, it's me - Stan.
Am I late?
Not if you're willing to play Dorothy.
Come on in, Stan.
You're fine.
Babe, you will never guess what I went out and bought today.
It's got whitewall tires, original upholstery, and it's the same one we took to our senior prom.
Stan, that's impossible.
No, Dorothy, don't give up.
We'll get this.
Uh It's in the driveway right now.
"Studebaker" right across the back just like my old one.
OK, OK, no more hints.
Rose, head down.
It's quiet time.
Stanley, what possessed you?
I love that car.
All the memories we had in that car, huh?
The cruising, the drive-ins, the road trips.
And don't forget the accident you had in that car.
What accident?
I'll give you a hint.
It cost me 10 bucks every Christmas and still calls me "Grandma".
Well, let's see.
Is it something that floats?
Come on, babe.
Let's go for a spin.
Stan, there's something I have to talk to you about first.
We can talk in the car.
Come on.
I'll get my purse.
I'll meet you outside.
Dorothy, I'm not crazy about you going out with him this way.
Ma, I told you, we're just going to talk.
I'm going to explain to him that I am not attracted to him, this is just a friendship and I'm sorry if he thinks it's more than that.
I wish I could believe you.
Just be careful.
And remember what they taught you at parochial school.
Keep both your feet on the ground, no patent leather shoes and macaroni and cheese every Wednesday.
Thank you, Ma.
She's lost it.
My God, what are you kids doin' in there?
It's all right, Officer.
We're divorced.
Are you still on the phone with Abby?
Blanche, I can't get Abby off the phone.
Tell her a St. Olaf story.
What'll that do?
Give it a shot.
You know, Abby, something like that happened to me in St. Olaf.
Sure, I understand.
Yeah, this is a good time to replace the batteries in your smoke alarm.
That's odd.
She hung up.
Oh, Sophia, you're up.
Were we makin' too much noise?
No, I'm awake because I was feeling frisky.
What say we get out the Ouija board and scare up our husbands?
Rose is still having trouble with that friend at work.
I can't just tell her to leave me alone.
Maybe someone else can, someone who's more candid about their feelings.
Well, like who, Sophia?
Give it some thought, slut puppy.
You know, Sophia, actually, you're pretty straightforward.
It's a gift.
So tomorrow at We'll take care of it.
Oh, thank you, Sophia.
You're welcome, Pussycat.
I'm not Dorothy.
From now on I'm calling everybody Pussycat.
It's cheaper than buying new glasses.
Psst.
She gone?
Are you just gettin' in?
Shh.
Yes.
Have you been with Stan all this time?
The car ran out of gas.
Ohh.
I've used that a thousand times.
Dorothy Zbornak, did you do what I think you did tonight?
I don't know what on earth you're - yes.
I can't believe this.
How could you sleep with that man?
She slept with him?
What did you think she did?
Well, she looks like she was pushing his car.
Oh, I don't know.
I don't know.
He's just been so sweet lately, and we were at the beach in the same old car that we used to make out in, and it just got to me.
It was exciting.
Dammit, Dorothy, if you'd have sex in public more often, this kind of thing wouldn't happen.
Look, I'm mad enough at myself as it is.
I mean, Stanley Zbornak made me weak in the knees.
What, you think I'm proud of that?
Who made the first move?
I guess I did.
It was dark, and Stan stopped the car.
I swear to you, I thought I was setting the parking brake.
Well, that's good.
Safety first.
To make matters worse, the sex was incredible.
It felt real and familiar.
It made me feel like I've been kissing strangers for the past seven years and then suddenly tonight I was with a familiar and I must say surprisingly agile old friend.
So what are you gonna do now?
Oh, you do have a problem, Dorothy.
How do you break off a relationship when the sex is great?
When the sex is lousy, it's easy.
Two more dates, and it's over.
Well, you know, just to make sure.
I remember the best sex of my whole life.
Was it difficult to get out of the relationship afterwards?
No, not really.
Poor Charlie died in the middle of it.
Was that really the best sex you ever had with him?
Yeah.
There was something wild about him that night.
Although I did think it was strange when he started yelling, "Rose, I'm going!
I'm going"!
Talk about your mixed emotions.
What was the best sex you ever had, Blanche?
Way to go, Rose.
Look, Blanche, it's late, there's only one cheesecake left, so let's make menopause the cutoff point.
Best sex.
Oh, it's just so hard to rate these things.
There's degree of difficulty, style points, choice of music Did they land on their feet during the dismount?
Different people have different strengths.
It's just impossible to tell, but anything over a nine is excellent.
Over a nine?
!
Points, Rose.
Points.
Oh, Sophia, did we wake you again?
No, I'm up because I'm feeling frisky.
What say we get out the Ouija board - Oh, Sophia, you already said that.
It's the middle of the night.
You want something fresh, turn on Letterman.
We were telling Best Sex Ever stories, Sophia.
Yeah, but now we're tired of telling them, so why don't we go to bed, huh?
No, wait.
It's a good thing I'm up, because it so happens that I have a story for you, the sex story to end all sex stories.
Sicily, 1922.
I stop by a little trattoria.
No, wait.
I'm thinkin' of the best meal I ever had.
I'll get it.
Hello.
Oh, yes.
Yeah, hello.
Um, no, I'm sorry, I can't discuss that right now.
Yes, I enjoyed it a great deal myself.
Really?
Yes.
OK, the earth did move.
Big quake in California.
Yeah, we'll speak soon.
I look forward to that myself.
Yeah.
Bye-bye.
Well, good night.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Why were we just telling our Best Sex Ever stories?
Gee, I don't - I don't know how it started.
Well, sure you do.
Remember?
You thought you were grabbing Stan's parking brake.
Thanks, Rose.
Well, good night.
That was Stan on the phone, wasn't it?
Something happened tonight.
All right, Ma, yes, I admit it.
I slept with Stan, and I should be ashamed of myself.
Are you this desperate, this pathetic?
Have you lost all your pride?
No, but keep it up.
We're getting there.
This is unforgivable.
Look, Ma, I admit I made a mistake with Stan tonight, but I will deal with it.
I mean, this isn't gonna ruin my life.
It was wrong, I know that, but now it's over.
It better be.
I won't allow it, not while you're living in my house.
Sophia, this is my house.
It is?
Oh, right.
Then let me give you two words of advice - enough wicker.
Sophia, I really appreciate you coming down here today, but maybe I better give it just one more try with Abby.
Rose, you're wasting your time.
No, just let me try.
Then if you sense that I'm starting to pull back Here - just squeeze my arm.
Gotcha.
Hi, Abby.
Oh, good.
You're here.
I've gotta talk to you.
Me too, and I really want you to listen - What?
I'm sorry.
I just can't get over how flabby this is.
Anyway, you know the station manager.
Well, he called me today, and there is this rumor that you're not - Excuse me, Abby.
I'd like to inject some candor here.
I'd also like to inject a tranquilizer dart into your backside.
But my dart gun was confiscated after the incident with the trick-or-treaters.
In my defense, it was dark, and I was unaware of this Ninja Turtle craze.
But I digress.
So to be brief, Abby, shut up.
Get a life.
Stop calling Rose.
She doesn't wanna talk to you, so leave her alone.
Thank you.
Is that what you wanted to say to me, Rose?
Well, I'm sorry, but I suppose so.
Excuse me.
Can I get your attention, please?
I'd like to clear the air.
Don't look at me.
I haven't had a raw vegetable in six months.
That's Mr. Percy, our station manager.
Well, the secret's out.
Our consumer reporter Enrique Mas has announced that he's leaving the show and moving on to the network.
But we feel we've found the perfect replacement.
She's dramatic, she's experienced.
Please welcome our new consumer reporter Abby Wolf.
If Abby is the new consumer reporter, doesn't that mean?
She's also my new boss.
Boy, have you got some serious butt to kiss.
What's so funny?
Oh, Marmaduke.
Look at how he drives that car.
I love my comics.
Every day, "Marmaduke" and "Apartment 3G".
I haven't read "Apartment 3G" since 1961.
Oh, well, let me catch you up.
It is later the same day.
Hello.
Oh, hi, Abby.
I guess I owe you a little apology.
You do?
Well, yeah.
I'll be right over.
Abby wants me to come over and help her get over her first-day jitters.
I know what you're thinking.
She's too dependent on me.
But I've decided it's better to be flattered than angry.
And it's nice that she needs me.
Besides, I have other friends who pay attention to me.
Special friends.
Friends like you.
Where's she goin'?
I don't think she said.
Where's who going?
Well, I guess I'll go read in bed.
Oh, no date with the missing link tonight?
Ma, I told you, I am not seeing Stan anymore.
I remember the tears that man caused me, the hatred I felt, and I don't need that grief again.
Good, because I worry about you.
You're still my little girl, you know, no matter how big you get.
Aw, thanks, Ma.
By the way, how big are you gonna get?
Good night, Ma.
Finally.
Where have you been?
Shh.
I got away as soon as I could.
You do have the Studebaker, don't you?
Almost out of gas and ready to go.
If my mother found out about this, she would kill me.
I'm getting the feeling you're ashamed of me.
Stanley, don't be silly.
Get down.
Stan, can't you even wait till we get to the car?
My God!
What are you kids doin' down there?
!
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Oh, Rose, good God.
My heart is still poundin'.
I was just in an accident.
Honey.
But don't worry.
I'm all right.
I'm OK.
Oh, thank God.
Any damage to your car?
Well, that's the one bright spot.
I had borrowed yours.
My car?
You didn't ask if you could borrow my car.
Well, I guess we both learned a lesson about leaving keys on the table.
I can't believe this.
How did it happen?
Well, you know how I like to meet rich men by gently rear-ending expensive cars at red lights?
Yeah.
Well, you say that like it isn't great.
Rose, it's the perfect plan.
You get to meet the guy, exchange addresses, then when he asks you who does good body work, you give him your phone number.
And this really works?
Well, not this time.
I had this really cute guy in a Jag lined up when this dork in a Duster cut in front of me and I nicked him instead.
Blanche, I am furious.
First you take my car without asking.
Then, when you have it, you show complete disregard for my personal property.
Rose, please have a little compassion.
I was just in an accident.
Well, what do you want me to do, carry you to your room?
Massage your neck?
Make some cocoa?
Diet cocoa.
I'm going out again tomorrow.
Blanche Oh, hi, Dorothy.
How was the funeral?
It was a humdinger, Blanche.
We closed the place.
Where's Sophia?
She's taking this pretty hard.
I guess she needs a couple of minutes by herself out in the car.
We're really gonna have to be there for Ma.
Oh, Dorothy, Sophia's like my own mother.
Until she feels better, I'm not gonna think about anything else.
My car!
It's ruined!
It's just a little scratch.
I can live with it.
What did you do with it?
Rose Do we have to do this now?
A nun has died.
More than a nun.
Sister Agnes was my mother's best friend.
Oh, she's out there alone now.
She hasn't said a word since we left the cemetery.
I have no idea how she's going to react to this.
I've made a decision.
I'm gonna become a nun.
Well, at least now you know.
Ma, what are you talking about?
God spoke to me today at the funeral.
He told me to join the order.
God spoke to you?
You haven't been eating chili dogs again, have you?
That was an honest mistake.
And to clarify, that's when I thought God was whistling to me.
This was him talking.
Oh, Ma.
Don't you think I know how crazy this sounds?
But it really happened.
Ma, I don't believe you.
God said you'd say that.
Ma.
He said you'd say that, too.
Ma, stop this.
Three for three.
Ma, this is ridiculous.
You don't want to be a nun.
Yes, I do, Dorothy.
God reminded me today that I've always had a dream, a very private dream, one I never talked about.
When I was growing up, I wanted to join the convent.
Well, until I was 17.
What happened then?
Your father put his hand in my blouse.
So?
So I felt soiled, filthy, dirty.
You know, in love.
But this time, I'm gonna fulfill my destiny.
This time, I'm gonna become a nun.
Do you believe what we just heard?
I can't believe anybody would want to be a nun.
I mean, "nun".
The word says it.
Well, you're not gonna believe this.
I've just been talking on the phone for a half-hour, and guess what.
You forgot to dial first?
No You held the receiver upside down?
Unh-unh.
It wasn't even the phone, it was the TV remote control.
No.
A shoe?
Blanche, please.
I'm not an idiot.
The TV has a remote control?
Anyway, this could be kind of important.
What?
Do you remember Mr. Nivingston, the guy whose rear end you smacked?
Well, my insurance company just called, and the guy is claiming he hurt his back.
He's threatening a lawsuit unless we settle out of court.
Oh, that's terrible.
I know.
And I'm the one he's suing, 'cause it's my car.
Oh!
Ha-ha!
Oh.
Boy, you had me goin' there for a second.
I thought you meant he was suing me.
Whew.
What?
Blanche, Rose may be taken to court for something that you did.
Don't you even care?
There's nothing to worry about.
He's just tryin' to hold up his insurance company.
There's nothin' wrong with that man's back.
How can you tell?
Because I know the crooked walk of man when his back has been injured.
I cannot tell you how many men I have seen limp out of my bedroom.
Shoulders stooped and their backs curved.
Blanche, that's different.
That's shame.
Oh, Sister Claire, how nice to see you again.
Come in.
Dorothy, this is Sister Claire.
She interviewed me last week about joining her order.
Please, sit down.
Ma, you actually went to a convent?
Why didn't I know that?
Because you're divorced.
Technically, in the eyes of the church, you don't even exist.
I spit on you.
Unless, of course, the sister would like to spit on you first.
I'm her daughter Dorothy.
You'll have to excuse my mother.
She suffered a slight stroke a few years ago which rendered her totally annoying.
And, uh, what brings you here?
The follow-up interview.
We have very strict guidelines when selecting postulants, so we're going to put Sophia through a battery of psychological tests.
It helps weed out the crazies and undesirables.
Sorry, Ma.
Can you imagine?
Rose is tryin' to blame the whole thing on me.
That woman has one hell of a lot of nerve.
Hello.
I'm a Baptist.
Excuse me.
Sister, is it all right if I sit in?
I don't think my mother would mind.
Think again.
I'd go outside, but there don't seem to be any shady pines to sit under.
Pillow, Pussycat?
We'll start with the ink blots.
Uh, "Who was a 1950s black singing group"?
Am I right?
Am I in?
Am I a nun yet?
She watches a lot of Jeopardy!
No, no.
You look at each one and tell me what you see.
It's a standard test used by psychologists, but we find it useful in our line of work, too.
Now what do you see?
I see an angel.
Very good.
How 'bout this one?
Uh, I see a dove perched upon the throne of God.
Excellent.
And this?
I see the Blessed Mother smiling sweetly as she pours love upon the hearts of the righteous standing at the gates of heaven, while St. Peter Ma!
Come on, you're making that up.
I am not.
Look, anyone can clearly see that is a picture of John Forsythe lying naked in a pool of honey Isn't it?
Do you think I would lie to get into the convent?
It does look a little like John Forsythe, doesn't it?
Look, sister, I'm sorry you made this trip for nothing, but this has gone far enough.
Ma, I cannot believe that you actually want to go through with this.
Who cares what you believe?
I had a beautiful experience.
God has called me, and I intend to answer.
You're really serious about this, aren't you?
Yes, Dorothy.
This means a lot to me.
Do you think I could leave you that easily?
A minute ago you were gonna spit on me.
Do you have this much trouble with your kids?
What's wrong, Rose?
It's my insurance company.
They've cut me off because of the lawsuit.
What am I gonna do?
Well, you need a good lawyer.
Give me the keys to your rental, and I'll go out and see if I can nail one for you.
Blanche, that's how you got me in trouble before.
Isn't there anything else you can do?
Well, I suppose we could prove Mr. Nivingston was faking his injury if we could trick him into performing certain physical acts of a sexual nature.
All we'd need is a devastatingly beautiful woman with a flair for seduction.
How about Mrs. Hufstad down the street?
I mean, she's something of a dog, but she'll do it with anybody.
I was talkin' about me.
Oh, yeah.
You will, too.
Rose, I won't go all the way.
I'll just get him in the bedroom and, uh, put him through the normal warm-ups.
And we'll have a certain Scandinavian nitwit hidin' in the closet with a camera.
Wouldn't it be better if I hid in the closet?
Yes, Rose, I suppose it would.
But do you really think you can get him to remove the neck brace?
Oh, please.
I once got a man to crawl out of a full body cast.
Well, I'm almost ready to go.
Today?
You're not goin' today?
Why didn't you tell us?
Every time I bring it up, one of you tries to talk me out of it.
We were just being selfish.
We didn't wanna lose you.
There's my ride.
Oh, Sophia.
Yep.
It's a Granada full of nuns.
Sophia, you have no idea how much we're gonna miss you.
It's like losing a member of the family.
Rose is right.
You're just like a mother to us.
We feel like your daughters, too.
I feel the same way.
Rose, just remember, you're smarter than people say you are.
You've got common sense and you know what you're doing.
Oh, Sophia.
Blanche, you're a slut.
Oh, Sophia.
Well, I better go.
Nuns don't keep well in a hot car.
We'll go out and tell 'em you're on your way.
Come on, Rose.
Well, I guess this is it.
I'm just so sorry that it took me so long to realize how much this meant to you.
It's just very hard for me to let go.
Me too.
But someone else needs me more.
It's time for me to move on.
My job here is done.
I always love it when you talk like the Lone Ranger.
Ma, I want you to know that I support your decision.
I think you'll make a great nun.
Thanks.
I needed to hear that.
I love you, Ma.
I love you, too, Tonto.
Careful, Arthur.
Watch your step.
Blanche, if I only could.
Oh, forgive me, sugar.
Well, here, I'll watch it for you, you poor thing.
Thank you, Blanche.
I can't believe how nice you're being to me even though I'm suing your friend.
Well, I've always been attracted to ever-so-slightly younger men.
Besides, just look at you.
Ooh!
Must be so frustratin' for an athlete like you.
Did you ever play any college ball?
No.
As a boy, I got as far as the Pee-Wee leagues, but then I discovered stamps.
Wow.
You know, when I first saw you, I said to myself, "Philatelist".
I like that.
Ooh, you're gettin' so tense.
Hey, why don't we go in my bedroom, see if we can't loosen you up a little?
Oh, I'm not sure.
See, my lawyer - I mean, my doctor - Sorry.
I get 'em mixed up.
They're both in the same mall.
You just forget about that old doctor.
I know a little bit about physical therapy myself.
I'm sure you do, but, you see - If it'll make you feel better, I have a complete nurse's outfit hangin' up in my closet.
I gotta tell you, that does make me feel better.
What else have you got in there?
Ooh, ho-ho-ho-ho.
Wait!
What am I doing?
I can't play nursey.
I-I'm supposed to have whiplash.
If we can't be together soon, I'm gonna have to go with somebody else.
I haven't been with a man since my husband died nine years ago, and I'm just about ready to explode.
I'll see you tomorrow, Blanche.
Yeah.
Boy, this is really beginning to chafe.
Ar-- Were you able to get him to bed?
No.
Rose still in the closet with the camera?
Yes.
Maybe you'll get him tomorrow.
Yeah.
Oh, hi, Rose.
Out of the closet, I see.
Yeah, I'm back.
Look, I got a card from Ma.
Oh, Dorothy, read it out loud.
"Dear Pussycat, I have everything I need, but it's hard to get a decent bikini wax".
Oh!
Ha-ha.
Ha-ha.
"Dorothy, I remember you fondly, and the same goes for Blanche and Rita".
"Wish you were here.
"No one can reach the third shelf in the pantry.
Best, Sister Ma".
God, I miss that woman.
Say what you want about her, we all loved having her around.
I miss someone to have a chat with at midnight.
You know what I'm gonna miss most about Sophia?
The way she used to tease me.
The way she would ever-so-subtly jab me with names like "tramp" "Floozy".
"Trollop," "harlot".
"Magic carpet ride".
"The human luge".
But she was never cuter than when she simply called you "shore leave".
Oh, God, I miss that woman.
OK, is everybody in?
I got a pair of jacks.
Ooh.
Wait, Sophia.
I have the two, seven, jack, ten and - that's right - a four.
That doesn't beat a pair of jacks.
Well, it did when you had it.
I told you.
That's called a "Whizzer".
It's only good once a night.
Uh, I'll be putting this in the collection box later.
Sophia?
Clear out.
It's the man.
Hello, Reverend Mother.
My, you look holier-than-thou today.
Save it, Sister Suck Up.
How do you explain this note I found in the suggestion box?
You said we needed money for the chapel.
I thought that would be a good fund-raiser.
A beefcake calendar of "Monks of the Midwest"?
Oh, come on.
Open up your mind.
Sophia, I'm going to go pray now.
I won't tell you what I'm going to pray for because it would hurt your feelings.
But when I'm done, I expect a complete change of attitude.
Understand?
Ooh, I'm so scared.
What is she gonna do, take away my self-denial privileges?
Ma.
Pussycat, what are you doin' here?
Oh, I just missed you and wanted to say hi and see how you're doin'.
I'm doin' fine.
Ten days celibate.
Same here.
Ma, I have a little surprise for you.
Girls?
Oh Look who it is.
It's Blanche and Rose.
Where's the surprise?
Honey, we're your surprise.
We came to see you.
Nice to see you.
What a lovely surprise.
Welcome to our little convent.
Not even a Bundt cake, huh?
Look at you.
A nun.
I didn't think I'd be shocked like this.
It's just that you look so different than when Blanche is dressed as a nun.
So, uh, what's new at home?
Oh, I did get a chance to go into your bedroom, Sophia, and there's just no way I'll be able to refund your cleaning deposit.
Totally understandable.
I'll see you in court, my child.
Sophia.
Mother Superior, this is my daughter Dorothy and my ex-roommates.
Hello.
Sophia, why don't you run along?
I need to talk to your daughter alone.
Sure.
Whatever she says, I have an alibi.
So, Dorothy, I'll bet you love your mother a lot.
Well, that depends.
What has she done?
It's not necessarily anything specific.
It's my feeling that life here is too structured for her.
I'm afraid I don't follow you.
She is a stubborn, old, vindictive pack mule of a woman who won't follow the rules.
OK, I'm back with you.
Dorothy, I think her intentions are good, but this doesn't seem to be her calling.
Oh, but this means so much to her.
Oh, this would break her heart.
I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to ask her to leave.
Oh, Mother Superior, with your permission, may I be the one to tell her?
We've been through so much together, I'm sure that any bit of bad news would be easier to take if it came from me.
Well, then, here's another one for you.
We've seen her room.
Tell her she won't be getting her cleaning deposit back.
God, I'm so confused.
I don't know where I belong.
I'm trying to wrestle with the deep religious questions of the ages.
Like, what do you really want from me?
What is my real purpose in life?
What was Edward G. Robinson doing in The Ten Commandments?
Come in.
Ma, where are Blanche and Rose?
Oh, they wanted to browse in the gift shop.
They're having a sale on John the Baptist placemats.
Ma, do you remember that summer you told me I didn't get into Girl Scout camp, and you said we were gonna have more fun than any two people ever had?
They want me out?
Yesterday.
Dorothy, I don't get it.
I know God wants my life to be meaningful.
That's not gonna happen unless I'm here.
Ma, your life is meaningful.
You do nothing but help other people.
You do Meals On Wheels, Red Cross, volunteer hospital work.
The point is, you don't have to be in a convent to make your life meaningful.
I mean, Sister Agnes belonged here, but you don't.
So who's gonna take Sister Agnes' place?
Nobody can take her place.
Just like nobody can take your place.
I miss her.
I know.
Let's go home.
All right.
But I'll be missing movie night.
But so what?
After the tenth time, it isn't the greatest story ever told.
Here you go, Ma.
Guess it's gonna take you a little while to get adjusted to being home from the convent, hmm?
To tell you the truth, Dorothy, it isn't that much different.
Whoa!
Give me that film.
Rose, go!
Run!
Good to have you home, Ma.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Blanche, look at all these flowers!
Oh, my God.
Who died?
Did one of us die?
They're mine, Sophia.
They're from a secret admirer.
Ma, look.
I got flowers.
Two bouquets of lousy, stinking flowers.
They're from my secret admirer, Dorothy.
Do you like 'em?
Every single one of 'em?
Oh, it just figures.
Oh, Dorothy, you mustn't feel so bad.
Why, this is a big day for you, too.
A girl always remembers the first time she gets flowers.
Rose, I am a woman in my 50s.
I mean, common sense says that I have gotten flowers before.
So, Dorothy, tell me.
Are those flowers from men?
Are they?
Huh?
Are they?
It doesn't matter.
It's not important that men find your daughter attractive and send her gifts as a token of their affection.
What is important is that you know it.
Write it down, all of you.
Dorothy, these are from celebrities!
Oh, Rose, that's private.
Lyle Waggoner and Sonny Bono!
Dorothy.
My poor, sweet, dead-end Dorothy.
You're sending flowers to yourself again, aren't you?
Why is it so hard to believe that I am being chased by two men?
Shut up, Blanche.
Last week, I didn't have anything to do one night - shut up, Ma.
So I went to the dinner theater and I saw Lyle and Sonny in a production of Equus.
Uh.
Our six eyes met, Sonny fell into the orchestra pit, Lyle forgot his lines and went into Under the Yum Yum Tree.
Except for the reviews, it was a magical night.
Sonny Bono and Lyle Waggoner!
Dorothy, this is an embarrassment of riches!
I wanted to tell you sooner, but, well, I was afraid that you might not believe me.
And why should we, Miss Junior Prom 1946?
Ma, you promised.
"Dating the quarterback," she says.
Buys her own corsage, spends the evening hiding in the basement, slow-dancing with a rake.
Would've gotten away with it, too, but while giving herself hickeys with a vacuum cleaner, she stepped into a puddle.
To most mothers, that would be a cry for affection.
To you, it's just ammo.
Let's just change the subject, OK?
If we're done with our journey to the land of make-believe, my secret admirer wants me to meet him for lunch.
Oh, Blanche, I can't believe you're gonna do it.
I mean, sure, the flowers are nice, but are you sure you know what you're getting yourself into?
Oh, come on, Dorothy, how much trouble can I get into in a public place?
How soon we forget the Greyhound terminal incident.
Here's a good idea, Blanche.
If you really want to be safe, why don't you let us come with you?
OK, you can all come.
But you have to promise me you won't do anything to embarrass me.
I promise.
Oh, I promise.
I'll try, but if they serve me cauliflower, it's in God's hands.
Oh, girls, there are just shivers up my spine.
His eyes could be on me right now.
The tension's unbearable.
Can you feel it?
Yes, I can.
It's unbelievable.
Where's the damn waiter?
Dorothy?
Lyle!
I hope I'm not intruding.
Not at all.
What're you doing here?
Well, it's just that we did so many restaurant sketches on  The Carol Burnett Show.
I was waxing sentimental.
Oh, by the way, I'd like you to meet my mother Sophia, Blanche, and this is Rose.
Yes, it's me.
Lyle Waggoner.
No autographs.
No problem.
Ma!
If this is true, I'm rooting for Sonny - you know, the paisan.
Besides, there's something about this guy that just honks me off.
So, Dorothy, can I see you later tonight?
Oh, I'm sorry, Lyle.
I'm busy.
Busy?
It's Sonny, isn't it?
No.
I'm just confused.
I need time to think.
You take all the time you need.
But before I go, I want you to know something: I'm so glad we had this time together Just to have a laugh or sing a song Yes, it's me.
Hey!
Seems we just get started, and before you know it Oh, go ahead, finish your meals.
Comes the time we have to say, "So long" I hate it when he does that.
Mrs. Devereaux?
There's someone in the bar for you.
Oh, God.
Oh, girls, this is it.
Can you see him, Rose?
Yes, I think I can.
He's coming this way.
Oh!
He's very handsome.
OK, here I go.
Hello Oh, my God!
No!
All right, so he's not a ten.
Blanche, honey, please.
Oh, my God.
What in hell?
Why do you look like that?
I don't believe this!
What?
Blanche, Blanche, who is this?
If I didn't know better, I would say my dead husband, George.
Well, George.
We've heard so much about you.
Blanche, George followed you all the way home.
You have to talk to him.
He's alive, all right.
I poked him with a stick.
Blanche, Blanche, I know this is crazy.
But I talked to him and I really think it is George.
And I think you should talk to him, too.
I'm scared.
If you need us, we'll be on the lanai.
And miss this?
Like hell we will.
Shady Pines, Ma.
You're bluffing.
The west wing.
Right behind you.
Shady Pines, Rose.
This really shouldn't work on me.
George, is that really you?
It's me, Blanche.
But you're dead.
At least you're supposed to be.
I buried you nine years ago.
What in hell is going on?
Well, I guess the best thing to do is just give it to you plain and simple.
Blanche, I staged my death.
He stained his desk?
!
But, George, I arranged your funeral.
The eulogy, the flowers.
I even watched 'em put you in the family mausoleum.
Well, what can I say, Blanche?
Thanks.
What a day.
I don't know if I can take much more.
Hi-ho, everybody.
It's me, Sonny.
Oh, God!
Is Dorothy around?
She's out on the lanai.
I suppose you're wondering why a man like Sonny Bono Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
On the lanai.
Blanche, that is Sonny Bono.
He's a major television star.
Boy, you have been gone a long time.
I know you're shocked and that this has caused you incredible pain.
Yeah, you might say that.
I didn't do it to be cruel.
It may seem cowardly, but I didn't know how to tell you that I just couldn't be married to you anymore.
How could you say that?
!
It's Lyle, isn't it?
I'm just confused.
I need time to think.
What's there to think about?
Sonny has the eyes of a poet, the soul of a poet.
Hey, you're through with those furry vests, aren't you?
Oh, yes, ma'am.
Take her.
Blanche!
Are you OK?
No, I'm not OK!
I feel like I'm goin' insane.
My life's been turned upside down.
Just so we're in sync, it's this husband-back- from-the-grave thing, right?
Yes, you twit!
My husband who abandoned me nine years ago, and shows up now just to tell me he couldn't stand being married to me.
Blanche.
Excuse me.
I've had some experience in marital discord myself.
Sonny Bono, get off my lanai.
Dorothy, before I go, can I make just one more plea for your heart?
Oh, all right, Sonny.
Go ahead.
That was it.
Goodbye, Sonny.
Blanche, you didn't hear me out.
I've heard all I have to hear.
I know this is rough for you, but it's been rough for me, too.
Now you're gonna listen!
Nine years ago, I found out that my partner was embezzling from the family company.
He was a clever man.
All the signs pointed to me.
My business was collapsing.
I was facing disgrace, Blanche.
I could've stayed and faced the music, but it's just this damn Southern pride.
It's the same Southern pride that kept me from being a dancer.
George, please, I've had enough surprises for one day.
Blanche, faking my death was a mistake.
For the last nine years, every day without you has seemed longer than the one before.
Now you just say the word and I'll go back where I came from, but I guess what I'm really trying to say is Blanche, will you be my wife again?
No, Sonny, I haven't made a decision yet.
Besides, Blanche needs me now.
Look, I have to go.
No, Sonny.
No.
All right, if I do it, will you hang up?
I got you, babe I got you, babe Babe Blanche, can I get you something?
No, thanks.
Oh, damn.
I just can't believe how much my life has changed these past six hours.
George is back.
He wants to get together.
I don't know what to do.
Oh, pick Lyle!
Pick Lyle!
Oh, that's Dorothy's problem, isn't it?
I just feel so horrible.
Why do men do this?
Why do they deceive us?
Picture it - Germany, 1922.
Germany?
Were you on vacation, Sophia?
Spy.
Eh, it was a summer job.
Anyway, while in Heidelberg, XQ-37 - that's me - meets a man of science.
He gives me classified documents, I give him, well, a peek at the hinterland.
It's an epic love till it falls to shambles in utter deception.
He wasn't a man of science?
He wasn't a man.
You're making this up, XQ!
I can't believe that you were ever a spy.
I can't believe I told you.
Well, I guess I'm gonna have to kill you.
Someone was actually able to deceive me once.
Do tell, Rose.
St. Olaf's most famous OB/MAG.
What's that?
Obstetrician/magician.
The Amazing Shapiro.
He delivered Bridget.
But it was so confusing.
"It's a girl!
Now it's a dove!
Now it's a glass of milk"!
I don't know how he got her in that deck of cards, but there she was, right after the King of Hearts.
"Is this your baby"?
You know, ever since the funeral I've had this dream where it's all a mistake and George is really alive.
And I just feel so happy.
We see each other, we run to embrace, but just before we hug - always just before we hug - I wake up.
And I lie there for a split second thinking George is asleep beside me.
Until it dawns on me one more time that he's really gone, and I grieve again.
I grieved for that man nine years!
How can I forgive that?
Blanche, honey, you need to get ahold of yourself.
What I need is for things to be like they were this morning, before any of this ever happened.
You know, as far as I'm concerned, George Devereaux is better off dead.
Sonny!
Sweetheart!
My little cannoli!
Sophia!
Honey!
My Mama Celeste!
Of course you remember me, Lyle Waggoner.
Nah, I don't think I do.
Sophia, you must remember Lyle.
Sonny, Lyle.
What're you doing here?
Dorothy, we need a decision now.
So, who's it gonna be?
Me or pizza man?
Oh, insults from Lyle Waggoner, huh?
How many gold records do you have?
None.
I was never married.
Put 'em up!
Oh, now, this is ridiculous.
I do not want two grown men fighting over me.
Pussycat, how many chances are you gonna get?
Proceed.
Lyle Waggoner?
You're under arrest.
Arrest?
What's the charge?
I don't have time to list all of them, but he's a prime suspect in a major crime spree.
Where?
Palm Springs, California.
It's good to be mayor.
Let's go.
No, wait.
Dorothy, have you made a decision?
Yes, I have made a decision.
Sonny, I think that Lyle is the sweetest, kindest man I have ever met.
What you have done here is a totally underhanded, inexcusable abuse of power.
Oh, Sonny, the power.
But, Dorothy!
Gumba!
Ma!
All right, now, you kids go out, have fun.
I won't wait up.
Do anything you want to her.
Will do.
Well, Mel Bushman is picking me up in 15 minutes.
Blanche, George called again.
I told you, when he calls, take the message and throw it out.
I'm back to my old self.
Blanche Devereaux has returned!
Oh, boy, strike up the gland!
How rude.
You think she'd feel sorry for me.
To tell you the truth, I don't feel sorry for you, either.
I mean, why should I?
My Charlie is dead and nobody's giving me a second chance.
Listen, Blanche.
I know what it's like to have a husband suddenly taken.
I never had a chance to say all those things I would've wanted to say.
Well, you must know how that feels.
Yes.
But after what he did to me Blanche, this isn't about getting even.
For nine years you've been missing George.
Well, he's here and I'm jealous of you.
Tell him you love him, tell him you hate him, I don't care.
But just see him before he leaves.
Do it for yourself.
Do it for all of us who wish we had the chance.
Hi.
Hi.
Dorothy said you wanted to talk to me back here.
Well, Sonny and Rose and Dorothy are making so much noise in the living room.
So, did you make a decision?
Before I can even think about that, there's something I gotta do for me.
I know this is gonna sound crazy, but I need to ask for your forgiveness.
What?
I'm the one who should be down on my knees after what I did.
George, the day you died - or didn't die - I was home alone when the phone rang.
I ran to answer it and I tripped over your damn shoes, and I said, "Oh, George, I hate you".
It was the police telling me you'd been in an accident.
Never thought I'd have the chance, but I'm so sorry my last thoughts of you were "I hate you".
Well, honey, you always were fiery.
I love that about you.
There's more.
Since the funeral, I've been with other men.
Many, many men.
I always felt like I was cheating on ya.
Oh, Blanche, every day I was gone, I always wished you'd find somebody who could make you happy.
How-how many men?
Two.
Oh, honey, you don't have to ask my forgiveness for anything.
I love you.
Good God, you're as pretty now as the day we met.
Remember that first day we met?
The University Club Cotillion.
Our eyes met and I knew you were the only man for me.
So when it was ladies' choice, I sent my fiancÃ© off for some punch, and I strutted up to you and I said, "May I have this dance"?
And I said, "The pleasure would be all mine".
And I said, "I know it".
Oh, those damn eyes.
I still haven't seen in anyone else's what I see in yours.
Oh!
Oh.
Blanche?
You OK?
Oh, yeah.
Fine.
I was just checking.
Would you sit with me for a minute?
Well, sure, Blanche.
Boy, you were doing a lot of talking in your sleep.
Oh.
You had that dream again, didn't you?
I told you, I heard voices in here, and Oh, God, it's Dorothy!
I tell you, she takes one tennis lesson Ma, Blanche had her dream.
Are you all right?
I think so.
Usually I feel empty when I realize George isn't here, but this time, it's different.
How?
I don't know, the dream was diff Oh, wait.
I got to hug him.
You know how always wake up before I get to hug George.
This time I didn't.
Oh, Blanche, that's wonderful.
It was wonderful, Rose.
When he died, I thought, "Oh, the worst part is I'll never get to hold him again".
Tonight I did.
I could actually feel him.
Still can.
And you're gonna be all right?
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.
Good night.
Get yourself a good night's sleep.
Good night.
Oh, Blanche, just out of curiosity, were "they" in the dream?
As crazy about you as ever.
I'm sorry I'm laughing, but the idea of me with one of those two is just so silly.
You picked Sonny this time.
Yes!
Well, good night.
Good night, Dorothy.
Good night, George.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see The biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Hi, Sophia.
How was your date last night?
Tony Delveccio is a dreamboat.
Aw I wouldn't mind glancing over at the night table and seeing his teeth next to mine.
Ma, please.
I mean, it's probably silly, but I'm not that comfortable hearing about your romantic escapades with men.
Then you're gonna hate this.
I fantasize about him all day.
Last night, I dreamed I was Joan of Arc, and he was coming at me with a hose.
Ma, maybe it was just a religious-experience dream.
Did he put out the fire?
Three times.
Wow, the seldom-achieved Joan of Arc fantasy triple.
Sophia, I hate you.
I think I'm falling in love.
I haven't felt his way since your father.
But Tony looks at me as a friend, as a companion.
Honey, nothing wrong with that.
Yeah, but I'm picturing him naked, and I'm not laughing.
If you want my advice, I think you should sleep with him.
Done.
That is not what she wants.
Dorothy, the man came at her with a hose.
Oh, come on, Ma.
You haven't known him that long.
Take your time.
After a few months, better yet, a few years, then you can start thinking about a more physical relationship.
Look who's giving away years here.
You know my motto - today could be the last day of the rest of the your life.
Sophia, I'll bet with a few tips from me, you can have this guy Tony in bed in no time.
That's good, because that's exactly how much time we have.
My mother does not do that.
Yes, I do.
I've just been in dry dock.
I'm back now.
I'm suited up, Coach.
Put me back in the game.
OK, but you have to listen to everything I say.
When I say "jump," you say, "On who"?
I just got a special-delivery letter from St. Olaf.
Uh-oh, it's from the Department of Water and Coffee.
Coffee?
No, thanks.
It makes me jumpy.
Rose, what does the letter say?
You read it, Dorothy.
I need both hands to cover my ears in case it's bad news.
"Dear St. Olafian, I'm afraid there's bad news".
What?
"There's a drought in St. Olaf which threatens the crops".
Oh, no.
I better send water.
"Please do not send water.
"We have found that envelopes leak.
"Until the rains come, "we ask that all citizens be celibate, "except for Ulf, the Umbrella King.
He has suffered enough".
Well, if it'll help bring in the crops.
Oh, you cannot possibly believe that abstaining is gonna change the weather?
Blanche, I don't think you realize how powerful sex is.
Once, Charlie and I actually did it till the cows came home.
'Course, I was wearing a bell.
Of course.
Hence the nickname "Dingdong".
Hey, you're probably right.
Rose, if you're really serious about going through with this, I suggest that you discuss it with Miles.
He deserves to know the truth.
I don't wanna lie.
You don't have to lie to Miles.
Just don't tell him the truth.
Turn this thing to your advantage.
Now, if you hold Miles at bay, amazing things will start to happen.
He'll become more attentive, send you flowers.
He'll be a prisoner of love, and you'll be the warden.
And if you're interested, I have costumes for both of you to rent.
Blanche, first, you tell my mother to sleep with a stranger, now this?
What makes you think you know everything about the opposite sex?
Let the record speak for itself.
I have had 143 relationships.
And no convictions.
What do ya think?
Oh, you look very pretty tonight.
Not too pretty, I hope.
I have a date with Miles.
How is he dealing with the celibacy?
Well, he's doing fine.
Although he does spend a lot of time at the batting cage.
Rose, listen.
Now, you have a very critical date coming up.
Everything I said would happen has.
He's been more attentive, he's sent you flowers, he's done your laundry and returned most of it.
We're right on schedule, but tonight he's gonna ask you if you're seeing other men.
Do you know what you're gonna say?
I'm not sure.
Just be bold, be brazen, be brutal.
Now, what are you gonna say?
I'm not sure.
Rose, if you're gonna be my lump of clay, you gotta be a little bit smarter.
When he asks you if you're seeing other men, just tweak his nose and say, "My, my, sir, I do believe you're jealous".
What about the vapors, Blanche?
Shouldn't she be overcome by the vapors?
Blanche, can I come out now?
Oh, yeah.
Hold it just a minute.
Girls, I want to present Blanche Devereaux's latest creation.
I took an 84-year-old woman and made her look like a 65-year-old drag queen.
Then I said to myself, "Blanche, too much rouge".
So, after a few minor adjustments, may I present the new Sophia Petrillo.
Ma, are you in there?
You know, this is the first time in years I felt like the real me.
Should these be lower?
Ahh, all right, this is it.
Now don't forget - you've got something he wants.
Yeah.
What?
Don't worry.
It'll all come back to you.
Take your glasses off.
And it's a good idea if you can find something to compliment him on.
Hi.
Is it my imagination, or do you have less hair on your knuckles?
It could be, Sophia.
At my age, everything starts to go.
Sophia, it's Miles.
Hey, you look beautiful.
Boy, it has been a long time for you, hasn't it, big fella?
Ha-ha-ha-ha.
Well, let's get started.
There's magic in the air tonight.
What do I do if he wants to go back to his place?
Tell him you have a lot of work you have to do at home.
I don't wanna lie.
When you get home, we'll make ya clean out the garage.
Thanks, Blanche, I owe you one.
What if I got gorgeous for nothing?
What if Tony doesn't even notice me?
Well, that's his hard luck.
There are other fish in the sea.
The only ones my age are floating on the top.
Ma, remember - don't do anything I wouldn't do.
I think I crossed that line when I got a date.
Hi, Sophia.
Hi.
You remember Blanche and my Aunt Dorothy.
Ye - Nice to see you.
Nice to see you again.
Sophia, you look enchanting.
If I wasn't such a gentleman, I'd try to ply you with wine and take advantage of you.
There's a liquor store on the corner.
She can't drink.
It mixes with her medication.
Beautifully.
Aren't they adorable?
Seems like only yesterday I was putting her into the home.
Good night, pussycat.
You have nothing to worry about.
Ma, be good.
I promise.
You're good.
A promise is a promise.
Where does a sweet Sicilian girl like you learn to do those things?
I live with a slut.
Thank her for me.
Oh, it's nice to be with a real woman.
You didn't think I was too forward?
No.
You were a perfect lady.
And once again, don't worry about the pants.
I know a lot of good tailors.
You started.
Don't think I didn't notice you playing footsie with me under the table tonight.
No, that really was a spasm.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
Ha-ha-ha.
Aw I, uh I love you.
I said I love you.
Thank you.
And you?
I care for you.
You care for me?
Yes, very much.
I probably should've said that sooner.
Well, let's go get some sleep now.
What?
You care for me?
You care for a cat or a dog or a goat.
When I tell you I love you and you tell me you care for me?
Oh, please, Sophia.
I care for you a lot.
I'm going home and don't bother driving me.
Look, Sophia, can't we talk?
Don't even say my name.
I reached out for you.
If you didn't love me, how the hell could you make love to me?
I never wanna see or hear from you again.
Good night, and thank you for a wonderful evening.
Rose, what is going on?
Now, something is wrong.
I don't know what you mean.
It's obvious you're trying to avoid any kind of intimacy.
Like that place you dragged me to tonight.
Don't get me wrong.
I enjoyed the evening of lesbian poetry but, look, Rose, to tell you the truth, it just wasn't the swell time I had in mind.
Look, I'm starting to get a little suspicious.
There's somebody else, isn't there?
My, my, sir, I do believe you're jealous.
You know, normally, I hate it when people tweak my nose, but at least you're touching me.
Look, are you seeing somebody else?
My, my, sir, I do believe you're jealous.
One tweak is cute, Rose.
Two is Don't do it again.
I'm sorry for the tone, but I am a little bit cranky and tense for all the obvious reasons.
Look, something is wrong.
Are you seeing another man?
And don't touch my nose.
I just can't be with you now.
Oh, well, all right.
Maybe maybe I can't see you, either.
Goodbye.
You mean good night.
No, I think I mean goodbye.
Oh.
Just as I thought.
Nobody likes it.
Rose, what's the matter?
Miles just left me.
Oh, way to go, Blanche.
Because of you and your lousy advice, I've lost Miles.
Well, if you're gonna come home with this attitude and tweak my nose, and by the way, don't ever do that again because I hate it, I'm not gonna help you.
How was your date with Tony?
Do you enjoy getting old ladies in trouble?
Ma, you slept with him, didn't you?
Come over here.
Look me in the eye.
Did you sleep with Tony Delveccio?
A little.
Ma!
Blanche made me do it.
Don't you have a mind of your own?
If Gladys Goldfine told you to drink a whole bottle of Kaopectate, would you?
Who blabbed?
Everybody, just calm down.
Sophia, tell me what happened.
Same old story - girl meets boy, girl loses boy, girl can't remember her address, so cab just circles and circles and circles.
You told him you loved him, and he didn't say it back, am I right?
Did you bug my bra?
Sophia, I told you never tell a man you love him first.
That's a fatal mistake.
I just wanted to hear someone say "I love you" to me one more time.
Oh, Ma.
Would it make you feel better if I told you I love you?
Yeah.
All of a sudden, I feel like singing.
Take me to a piano bar.
I'm going to sleep.
If Tony calls, tell him I faked it.
Ma!
Well, I did.
Oh, baby, oh, baby, oh, baby.
Oh, please.
Come on, Sophia, join us.
Yeah.
Ma, you can't sit there waiting for a call forever.
Who's waiting for a call?
Hello?
Hello?
That was him.
I could hear him breathing.
He wants to make sure I'm home and not out with some other guy.
I have to make him jealous.
Dorothy, put on a suit and a tie.
Let's go by his hotel.
Ma, I'm not gonna put on a suit and a tie.
Are you satisfied, Blanche?
My mother wants to date me.
I suppose that's my fault, too.
Well, you have been giving out some very bad advice lately.
I haven't had such bad advice since my drama teacher told me I'd be perfect for the lead in the King and I. So stupid here shaves her head and doesn't get the part.
Wait a minute.
Don't think I don't know what you all are gettin' at.
You think the advice I gave was bad just because it devastated four lives.
Blanche, when are you gonna realize you have to be responsible?
This isn't a game.
You're playing around with the emotions of real human beings.
I've made a decision.
I'm gonna go see Tony.
Don't do that.
Now you have him right where you want him.
I'm not listening to you anymore.
Dorothy was right.
You got me into trouble, you got Rose into trouble.
You'd get Dorothy into trouble if anyone was interested in her.
Wait a minute.
Why, just the other day, that guy who works with our gardener, you know, the one with the leaf blower, told me that I looked nice with a little lilt in his voice and tried to blow my skirt over my head.
Everything but the white horse, huh, pussycat?
Look, Sophia Petrillo doesn't give up.
She fights for her man.
She can overcome anything.
She needs ten bucks for a cab.
Last chance, Rose.
Better come go with me.
Oh, no.
I'm too depressed to go to a firehouse.
The invitation says I can bring a friend to the barbecue.
Come on, Rose.
They're firemen.
After a couple drinks, they start to do CPR.
Oh, I envy you, Blanche.
You really have it together.
Not me.
I have too many hang-ups.
Good night.
Good night.
Rose, I think you ought to know something.
I didn't tell you - in fact, I never told anybody - but I cry every Thursday night.
But I thought you were so happy.
I am most of the time, but, hey, it's hard being Blanche Devereaux all the time.
It does begin to take its toll.
It's kinda lonely not having someone nice and decent like Miles.
My advice works with my men.
You know, the shallow guys I go out with.
But if you still want my advice, here it is.
Call Miles.
Honey, Blanche is right.
Aw, he's reasonable.
He'll understand.
I'm gonna call him, and I'm gonna tell him the truth.
You were right all along, Dorothy.
The truth is always the best.
That is very wise, Rose.
Well, I don't want you to think I just made that up.
I saw it this afternoon on TV When I was watching the new Lassie.
You know, that's actually an interesting story.
You see, the new Timmy was lost, and the new Lassie was trying to tell the new grandpa where he was, so the new Lassie - Rose, did I ever tell you that I cry every Tuesday at 8:05?
Excuse me.
Hello.
Oh, Helgie.
So what's going on in St. Olaf?
I can't understand ya, honey.
Are you moaning?
No.
Say it slowly.
Oh, God, it's raining.
Oh, God, it's raining.
Oh, God Oh, God, it's raining!
Here, I've gotta get to Miles.
Boy, it must be pouring.
Sophia, it's good to see you.
I just came by to pick up my MedicAlert bracelet.
I believe I left it here last week.
I'm wearing it.
That's dangerous.
No.
It turns out we're both allergic to the same things.
Aw Aw I've missed you.
Missed me so much you haven't called me in a week?
Sophia, sit down.
I picked up that phone a hundred times, but I just couldn't make that call.
I haven't told anyone I love them since since my wife died.
That's a long time ago.
Yeah, but this I-care-for-you thing has always worked up until now.
Sophia, I do love you.
I love you, too.
So, what do we do now?
You wanna see pictures of my late wife?
I thought you'd never ask.
I brought some of my husband Sal.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see The biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Thanks for bringing the boys over, Dreyfus.
So long, kids.
Oh, I just love it when Dreyfus brings the puppies over to play.
I really think they like it, too.
That's because you bring the stick to them.
I know.
They get so excited when I fetch.
You like having them over, too, don't you, Sofia?
Yeah, I like 'em.
That's because it temporarily shifts the blame if we find a puddle on the floor.
Once, Nurse Ratched, once.
Well, I do not believe it.
Saturday, and I don't have a date.
Do you fathom what this means?
The jailbreak is off?
Oh, come on, Blanche, do what I do when I don't have a date.
I curl up with a good book, and I'm satisfied.
It's my fault.
I read to her as a child.
As a matter of fact, I'm going to the library in a few minutes.
Wanna come?
The library?
That's a great idea.
I just love libraries.
You do?
I've loved books since I was a child.
Although I certainly did grow up around some ignorant people.
Do you know what horrible thing the folks in my neck of the woods did once when I was a youngun?
Besides using phrases like "neck of the woods" and "youngun"?
They burned books.
The townspeople made a big pile of 'em in front of the library and they threw a torch on top.
Only Big Daddy was outraged.
He fought his way through that crowd, clawed his way to the top of that pile, grabbed that lit torch and turned to that crowd and said, "What are you people doing?
This is lunacy.
Ya start a fire from the bottom".
So many books.
That's why they call it a library.
It's from the Latin librarius, which means "so many books".
I'm sure you'll find something you want.
I do believe you're right.
Excuse me.
My friend here would like to apply for a library card.
What friend?
Oh, the one who's checking out everything but the books.
Hi.
What you readin'?
Oh, ho-ho.
You must be a passionate man.
Females to Fondle?
Well, it's volume seven of the encyclopedia.
Oh.
Ha-ha-ha.
My mother talked me into getting her the new Stephen King.
Well, we do have the one that came out last Tuesday.
As long as it's not about some little creature who finds new and inventive ways of terrorizing a household.
It's for my mother.
I don't wanna give her any ideas.
You're a sports agent?
I bet we know some of the same people.
I was one of the first women ever allowed in the Miami Dolphins' locker room.
Reporter?
Photographer.
Ha-ha-ha.
I don't understand.
There must be some mistake.
I'm sure my mother's card is current.
See for yourself.
It expired five years ago.
I don't know how that could've happened, but I'll put the book on my card, and I want you to know my card is always current.
I come to the library at least three times a week, and my books are always returned promptly during regular library hours, rain or shine.
Who are you to judge me?
!
Now, let me get this right.
Dinner at your place tonight?
What kind of girl do you think I am, and how could you tell so fast?
My address is on my card, and I have a meeting with a client in a half-hour, so I better get rolling.
See you at eight.
Oh, by the way, Ma, when I was at the library, they said your library card had expired five years ago.
Really?
Where could I have been?
Oh, yeah, locked in an old-age home.
Dorothy, I cannot go through with it.
I'm gonna call Ted and cancel.
Oh, Blanche, you can't.
Well, but it isn't fair.
He should've told me he was disabled.
Yeah, what a great icebreaker.
Well, if I have to go, you know what I could do?
I could take a chaperone.
That way, I'll avoid any awkward situations.
You could be my chaperone.
Oh, please.
No, I'm serious.
You're the perfect third wheel.
I don't mean that in a negative way.
I just mean you make men uncomfortable.
It's a gift.
Don't waste it.
As long as you don't mean it in a negative way.
Of course not.
Growing up in the South - God, here it comes!
The honeysuckle, mint juleps, three-legged dogs, you and Opie and Floyd and the barbershop Blanche, get to the point.
I need a chaperone.
Now, do I have to call in all the favors you owe me?
What favors?
I need a chaperone.
Now, do I have to call in all the favors you owe me?
I don't owe you any favors.
Oh, really?
"But, officer, the little old lady was with me.
She couldn't possibly have put that banana in your tailpipe".
It'll be an honor to serve.
Guess what.
I spoke with Harry this morning, and he said we can keep one of the puppies.
No!
I can't believe you said no.
Come on, Rose.
We've talked about pets.
There's no one home during the day to take care of it.
I'm home during the day.
No one lucid is home during the day.
Oh, please.
I've already named him Bingo, and he really likes me.
He follows me wherever I go.
Rose, the answer is no.
That's not fair.
Last week, you got to keep the boxboy who followed you home.
There, you see?
You don't need a dog.
If you're lonely, get yourself a man.
I don't want a man.
I just wanna come home from work and have someone jump up on my lap, lick my face and fetch a ball when I throw it.
You can get a man to do that.
I'll be right back.
Say hello to the newest member of our family.
Oh, great, we gotta live with a sad-eyed, hyperactive nuisance with the intelligence of a squeaky toy.
And now she's got a dog.
Miss Devereaux?
Yes.
Won't you come in.
Thank you, Andy.
Blanche, come on in.
Sit down.
And who's this?
Who do I look like?
I'm her mother.
Grandmother.
Having a chaperone is an old Southern tradition.
Grammy here brought me up since I was a child.
She's the one who taught me how to put up peach preserves, make my own clothes.
We was po'.
Blanche, you didn't strike me as the type who needed a chaperone.
As I said, it was a tradition.
We Southern families stick together.
We sho' do.
Well, I suppose it's been nice having someone look after you since you were young.
I had to.
When she was 15, I caught her under a pile of hillbillies.
Picture it - me with a crowbar prying cousins off left and right.
Oh, goodness, with a view like that, why I bet you look out the window a lot.
Blanche, you a little nervous?
Nervous?
Me?
Wheelchair.
Oops I mean, no, no, not at all.
Come on, Blanche, most people in wheelchairs were something else until that one second before their accident and their lives change.
Hey, take a look at this guy in the baseball uniform.
I'm still basically that guy.
Ha-ha.
Y-You certainly do have a nice place here.
I took it because I spend so much time in Miami, and I do hate hotels.
Oh, yeah, I know.
The way they charge you for the whole night when you're only there for a few hours.
My roommate Dorothy told me that.
She's a slut.
I hope you like champagne and caviar.
I love it.
Andy Oh Oh Hey, look who's not po'.
Mmm, this was just delicious.
I'm glad you feel more comfortable.
Oh, yes.
I don't know why I was nervous in the first place.
Boy, you should see this bedroom.
A giant-screen TV, a big round bed and lights that go on when you clap.
My hands are raw.
That Southern accent of yours really comes and goes.
Grits.
Alright?
Ha-ha-ha.
That grandmother of yours is really a sweetheart.
She sure is.
Bless her heart.
How do we get rid of her?
Why, Ted Tanner, are you making a pass at me?
If I strike out, I strike out, but at least I want my turn at bat.
I have to admit, I'm somewhat interested and a little bit curious and suddenly now quite nervous.
Maybe it's not meant to be with your grandmother wandering around.
She has a bus pass.
I can have Andy drive her.
Come here.
Well, mercy me.
Looks like my little magnolia just turned into a big ho'.
Rose, we have to talk.
Look, the food dish is overturned, there is a hole in the newspaper, the potted palm in the hallway has been dug up.
I cannot live like this.
Dorothy, please don't send me away.
I'll try harder.
I'm talking about the dog.
Oh.
In that case, I also saw him slip two 20s out of your purse.
Rose, obviously the dog has to go.
Well, that's not your decision.
Where's Blanche?
She's not home from her date.
She spent the night at Ted's?
You don't suppose that Nah.
Please!
Just because a man's in a wheelchair doesn't mean he can't satisfy a woman.
What do you know about this, Ma?
Picture it Sicily, 1914.
A man in a wheelchair satisfies a woman.
It's a short story, but I think it makes my point.
Hello, my lovelies.
Sophia, I'm sorry I tossed ya out last night, but it was for a good cause.
That's OK, Blanche.
Andy took me home in the limo, and, boy, did we have fun.
I figured out why they call it a moon roof.
Blanche, tell us about your date last night.
All I can tell you is Mr. Ted Tanner is quite a man.
He suits me to a "g".
You mean to a "t".
No, I don't think so, Rose.
Oh, don't hold dinner for me tonight.
I have a date.
I guess I better go get out of these clothes.
Again?
Rose, you got a reprieve.
As long as Blanche isn't here, she won't find out you brought a dog into the house.
What do I care if she finds out?
I'm not afraid.
I'm within my rights.
There is nothing in my lease that says I can't have a pet.
All right, who or what ate the heel off one my new red pumps?
I did.
Guess what.
I don't like to brag and it took me practically all morning, but by reinforcing the command with love and a doggie treat, I finally taught Bingo how to sit.
Sit down, Rose.
Okey-dokey.
I really wish you'd try to get along with Bingo.
Maybe you don't know the fun you can have with a pet?
Have you ever actually had one?
Of course I had a pet.
Remember, Ma?
I was six years old, and I wanted a pony?
Not the pony thing again.
She promised me a pony.
She swore I'd get a pony.
She brings me a little paper bird on a stick from the circus.
The kind you have to twirl around your head to get them to tweet.
And that was your pet?
They're very clean.
Then she tells me if I'm a good girl, a really good girl, God will turn that paper bird into a real one, which I believed, because why would a mother lie?
So every day, I'm being very good and praying and looking for any sign of life and becoming very attached to that ridiculous paper bird.
So you can imagine my heartbreak when one morning I find it dead.
How does a paper bird die?
Good question.
Someone used it to restart the pilot light.
Hurry up.
Get dressed.
We're gonna be late for temple.
Ma, it's Tuesday, and we're Catholic.
In that case, bacon and eggs.
Ah, girls, I just don't know what I am gonna do about Mr. Ted Tanner.
If the man wants to colorize movies, let him colorize movies.
It's show business, for God's sake.
Blanche, what's wrong?
Ted called from Philadelphia, says he's flying in, and he wants to see me.
Well, I'd think you'd be happy.
I am, but it's just that during this past week with Ted out of town, everything was on hold.
I didn't have to make any decisions about where our relationship was going.
I don't know what to do.
I'm here if you wanna pick my brain.
Rose, I think we should leave it alone and let it heal.
It was clear from Ted's tone on the phone that he wants to escalate our relationship.
He said he hoped I wasn't seeing anyone else.
I just don't know.
I think you should go for it.
See it through.
Blanche, so many times you drop somebody without ever knowing what it could turn into.
Sometimes you have to take a chance.
I don't know if I'm ready for that kind of risk.
A little risk only heightens the thrill.
It's like making love in an airplane lavatory, where you know it's wrong because the guy you're with really should be at the controls.
Well, it was just an example.
Who are you to judge me?
Well, Sophia, did you feed Bingo today?
To what?
Ma, you did feed the puppy today, didn't you?
I think we both had one of those international coffees - mocha minty or something - I don't know.
We both threw up a little.
Honey, did that mean old lady put you in the garage?
No.
The mean young lady did.
Rose, Ted's coming over later, and I don't want that dog making a big mess.
He's already been into my personal things.
Maybe we should get him some rubber toys.
They do seem to be his preference.
Look, Rose, I don't think this is gonna work out.
Now, we are out all day.
Puppies need care from someone with a knowledge of loving and nurturing.
And let's face it, that is not Ma.
Oh, Bingo, much as I love you, little guy, we've gotta do what's best for you.
Wish I knew what to say to make leaving easier.
You know, I used to have a little dog just like you back in St. Olaf.
She said St. Olaf, Bingo.
I told you, that's the attack command.
OK.
Thank you.
Oh, great news.
There's an organization called Pets for People.
They match up pets with old people.
Well, I took Bingo over there this afternoon, and already they have a perfect home for him.
I hate to say it, but I'm gonna miss the little guy.
Sure was a lot more fun than that bird on a stick.
Ehh, she's not here.
Oh, get in here, you.
Aw, I've missed you, Ted.
I missed you, too.
I have so much to tell you about, oh, how good I feel about us and how much I was worried that you being in a wheelchair would be more than I could handle, but you know what?
I realized it isn't.
I just really like you.
I am a lucky guy.
Why don't we go someplace romantic for a few days?
I have to go back home tomorrow.
Oh.
Well, take me with you.
Show me the wonders of Philadelphia.
The Liberty Bell.
The cream cheese.
I can't take you.
Why not?
I just can't.
Is there someone else?
Oh.
There's somebody else.
Oh, a girlfriend.
You got a wife?
I'm sorry.
Sorry?
I do not believe this.
You know, I kept telling myself to stay open to this, that you were just such a special guy who happened to be sitting down.
I was actually starting to feel love for you, Ted.
I thought you were noble.
Never dawned on me you could be a jerk in a wheelchair.
Ach get out.
I don't believe we have to stop seeing each other.
Blanche Devereaux never goes out with another woman's husband.
Oh, except for that one time.
Now, that was not my fault.
She was pronounced dead.
Those paramedics never give up.
Don't end this, Blanche.
My wife doesn't understand me.
Well, I do.
You're a cheat.
Get out.
Oh, as God is my witness, I will never pick up another man.
In a library.
On a Saturday.
Unless he's cute and drives a nice car.
Amen.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Rose, can you help me with this necklace?
Oh, sure.
Ugh, I'm so nervous.
Have you ever given a eulogy?
You mean at a funeral?
No, Rose, at a pie-eating contest.
Ugh, I just don't know what I'm gonna say.
Well, actually, I was asked to say a few words at Lenny Linderflot's funeral once.
Everybody thought we were good friends, 'cause all through school, he sat right in front of me because we were in alphabetical order.
But in reality, all I knew about Lenny was what the back of his head looked like.
So, what did you say?
"I loved the back of Lenny Linderflot's head.
"He had the back of the head of an honest man.
"And after seeing him face-up in the casket today, not a bad-looking guy either".
Thanks, Rose.
It's not exactly what I'd like to say about my brother, Phil.
I'm sorry.
I wish I could help.
Honey, you've been more than a help.
I wouldn't have gotten through the past few days without you.
I mean it.
Oh, stop.
So, what are you gonna say?
I don't know.
I just want to say a few words to give the man some dignity and show him a little respect.
Ready?
To run with the bulls in Pamplona?
Dorothy, you know this is my funeral dress.
I don't believe in wearing black, unless I'm a little bloated.
Oh, did you happen to notice if my mother's all right?
Oh, she's fine right now.
You know, last night she talked to me about the pain of losing a child.
I think that's got to be the most painful thing a mother can go through.
She's being a rock.
Maybe too much of a rock.
She's really keeping this all bottled up.
She's in shock.
The whole family's in shock.
I mean, a man goes out to buy himself an evening gown, you don't expect anything unusual, do you?
No.
Heart attack at his age.
I spoke to him just a couple weeks ago, he was fine.
He said he'd put on some weight, but to die trying on knockoffs at Big Gals Pay Less.
It's just all so sad.
Well, I'm all set.
What's with Satan's secretary?
Sophia, I believe Phil would have liked this dress.
Liked it?
He would have looked great in it.
I never understood why your brother wore women's clothes, unless he was queer.
People don't say "queer" anymore.
They say "gay".
They say "gay" if a guy can sing the entire score of Gigi.
But a six-foot-three, 200-pound married man with kids who likes to dress up like Dorothy Lamour?
I think you have to go with queer.
Aw, Ma, I don't know.
I mean, he must have had some deep psychological need and cross-dressing provided an emotional outlet.
I may be old-fashioned, but why didn't he just drink?
Tell me, is Big Sally coming to the funeral?
Sophia, Phil's wife's name is Angela.
Why do you call her Big Sally?
Because she hates it.
Just as she probably hates that I talked Phil into being buried in the family plot.
He never should have married her.
She hates all of us.
Not true.
She hates you.
Oh, Ma, don't you think this feud between you and Angela has gone on long enough?
It's 26 years.
In Sicily that's not a feud.
In Sicily people scream at each other for centuries, and they throw pasta at each other.
Pasta and sauce.
Rich sauce with delicious seafood.
Mussels, shrimp Wait a minute.
I think I switched from feud to food.
He looks very peaceful and natural.
As natural as a man can look wearing a black teddy.
It's a beautiful teddy.
I think more men should be buried in teddies.
I've got to remember, it's not the clothes that make the man, it's the man that makes the clothes.
Oh, God, he looks like he died in a Benny Hill sketch.
There's nothing we can do about it now.
Besides, it's probably what Phil wanted.
I'm gonna go check on Ma.
Listen, if it makes you feel any better, I don't see anything wrong with it.
Oh, thank you, Blanche.
This means a lot coming from a woman who wants to be buried dressed like a majorette.
Ma, do you want to come say goodbye to Phil?
I can't go up there, Dorothy.
Is that terrible?
Of course not.
Honey, you're doing what you can.
Does he look nice?
Yeah.
In a suit?
Not exactly.
A dress?
Not exactly.
Culottes?
Not in culottes - that would break my heart.
He's wearing a teddy.
But a masculine teddy.
Where is Big Sally?
Oh, Ma.
Her name is Angela.
Ma, I want you to make peace with her.
Hello, Dorothy.
Sophia.
Angela.
Dorothy.
I don't know if it was a good idea to have the funeral in Miami instead of Newark.
I just talked to the priest.
He doesn't know a thing about Phil.
He thinks Phil was some kinda crazy combination brain surgeon/astronaut.
Where would he get the idea that Phil had an IQ of 160?
Well, if your brother hadn't been stumped by long division Angela, about this teddy It's a beaut, isn't it?
No surprise, though.
Phil had great taste.
That's one of the things I loved about him the most from the beginning.
His sense of style.
We were married for 26 years and my family still talks about that wedding dress.
God, I wish I could wear a plunging neckline like that.
Why couldn't you bury him in a suit?
Because this is what he wanted.
You know, it hasn't been easy for me, Sophia.
It hasn't been easy.
Oh!
Ladies, I'd like to start the service soon.
Father Salerno, Angela was worried that my mother might have given you the wrong idea about what kind of man my brother Phil was.
Not to worry.
The good Lord has given me a sixth sense, so to speak.
I can tell a lot about a person just by looking at them.
He was special.
I'm sure.
What can I say about Philip Petrillo?
He was special.
Very special.
Yeah, a man doesn't get any more special than this.
Wait a minute, is this one of those hidden video things?
Huh?
No?
Sorry.
Yeah, I think special says it.
He knows Phil like a book.
No charge.
You all right, Sophia?
Why does everyone keep asking me that?
I'm OK.
I'm fine.
I don't want to talk about it.
You know, I saw a lot of this when I worked at the grief center.
You're angry about Phil's death and that's normal.
But you shouldn't be angry with Angela.
I think you haven't cried because you haven't accepted his death yet.
Thank you.
I've never been psychoanalyzed by a dipstick before.
I wonder who they are?
You mean you don't know them?
No.
Now this is awful.
What?
What's awful?
Well, isn't it obvious?
Veiled, shapely creatures, unknown to the family, coming to say one last secret goodbye to their special friend.
You mean?
That's right.
Sluts.
I can't believe they came all the way from Newark.
You know them?
Phil tried to keep them a secret, but I knew he was spending his Thursday nights with them.
Oh, I know it's hard, but try not to hate 'em, my dear.
They're just lonely creatures who reached out to another person for a little warmth.
These are the guys from Phil's poker game.
This is too funny.
I have to get my camera from the car.
Angela, I wish you wouldn't rush right back to Newark after the funeral.
Stay at the house for a couple of days.
I gotta get back to work.
I was just promoted.
Chief make-over artist in the cosmetic department at Bamberger's.
Angela, Angela, this has to end.
You know, I don't think the family even knows what the fight was about.
I'll tell you what it was about - your mother hates me.
I'm sorry, Dorothy.
I've been invited to your mother's house twice in the past 26 years and that was quite enough.
Then why don't you come to my house?
Angela, please?
OK.
I'll come.
OK.
Maybe I could show Blanche how to correctly apply her makeup.
I'd like that.
Although she might be offended if I bring it up.
That's the part I like.
Angela.
Oh.
Folks, to begin this part of the service, Phil's sister, Dorothy, will say a few words.
Dorothy.
Please don't take this wrong, but I've got to know.
You are a girl, aren't you?
Seems like I'm always mad at my brother Phil.
I was mad the day my parents brought him back from the hospital.
I thought he'd take their love away from me, and instead, their love expanded and we felt more like a family.
I was mad at him when I was ten and he was four and we moved to a new neighborhood.
I was mad because he always made new friends more easily than I did.
And I'm mad today, because I never wanted to give the eulogy at my kid brother's funeral.
I'm mad because he died.
He didn't have the wisdom to know that family members shouldn't allow themselves to grow apart.
Because when this day comes, they can no longer tell each other how they care.
If he'd had that wisdom, he could have shared it with me and I would have known the hundreds of memories I have of just the two of us - eating ice cream on the stoop of our building, or going through the drawers at Grandma's house, or dressing up like the BrontÃ« sisters.
How those memories fill me with joy.
Why didn't you have that wisdom, Phil?
Why didn't you give us a chance to tell you how much we loved you?
Here we go.
Some nice snacks.
Ah, thank you, Rose.
Oh, look.
Here's one of Phil when he was 17.
Oh-ho-ho!
He looks so handsome.
Oh, I don't think I ever saw him in a tuxedo.
When was this, his prom?
Halloween.
Listen, Angela, what do you say that you and Ma and I have dinner tonight and, you know, clear the air a little bit.
Angela, please.
Hey, I'm willing.
But to tell the truth, I don't know what I did.
I also don't know how much more I can take of Sophia treating me this way.
Hi, everybody.
I'm back.
Hi, Ma.
Did you have a nice walk?
Yeah.
Ma, where'd you get the skateboard?
Oh, yeah.
I guess there's some kid at the park with an umbrella.
Ma, how would you like to go out to dinner tonight with Angela and me?
No.
Aw, come on, Ma.
This isn't an easy time for any of us.
Forget it, Dorothy.
I don't need her to be there for me.
The shame is she wasn't there for Phil.
When you wouldn't see me, you weren't seeing him.
On the holidays, when he would try to pretend that everything was OK, deep down, it killed him that he wasn't with his family.
My children really never got to know their grandmother because you didn't want to step foot inside my house.
Well, it wasn't just their loss, Sophia.
It was yours, too.
So whatever I did, or whatever you think I did, I hope it was worth all the pain.
You showed disrespect for our family, and family is sacred where I come from.
Phil knew how I felt.
You think it was easy for me?
I did what I had to do.
But what did I do?
You know very well what you did.
I swear, I don't.
Your dowry check bounced.
What dowry check?
Your father gave us a check for two million when we agreed to let you marry Phil.
Two million dollars for Phil?
Wasn't exactly a buyer's market, was it?
Not two million dollars.
It was lire.
With the exchange rate, it came to about $47.
But the check bounced anyway.
That is terrible!
I know.
I told Sal, "Get cash".
It's terrible that that's what the fight was about.
My father offered a dowry, and Charlie wouldn't take it.
Oh, maybe that's because he knew eventually those beans would stop jumpin'.
Or maybe he just loved me.
Beans.
I'll have you know it was the biggest pumpkin of the season.
I don't know who I'm madder at - my father for thinking he had to pay a dowry, or you for lettin' this go on all these years for a lousy $47.
Nobody stiffs the Petrillos.
Fine.
You think your family was wronged?
Let me make it right.
Here.
Here's a check, we're even.
Now are you happy?
Can I see your driver's license and a major credit card, please?
It was an out-of-state check.
Angela, I'm sorry.
It's not your fault.
I'm calling the airlines.
I'm getting the next flight home.
No, please.
Angela, please.
Hang up the phone.
I don't want you to go like this.
There's nothing left to say.
My mother wants to apologize.
Then why didn't she come in?
She's shy.
Sophia is shy?
In an obnoxious sort of way.
Look, Angela, I have to get you and Ma to end this.
Not for you, not for me.
For Phil.
I realize now that I was wrong not doing it while he was still alive.
Now, come on, Angela, take the first step.
What is it gonna take?
She has to admit that she's a little witch without much sense when it comes to family matters, who takes pleasure in making other people miserable.
That wasn't so bad, was it?
Ma, she really likes you.
I think this whole thing can be fixed.
Forget it.
Ma, you know, when I think of Phil, you know what I think of?
His capacity to love.
You know, no matter what anyone did to Phil, he always gave back love.
And you know where he learned that, Ma?
From you.
Now, Ma, what's happening to you?
Oh, come on, please.
Won't you come into the kitchen?
Sure, as soon as she comes on her knees and begs my forgiveness.
I think she'd like that.
All right, the little witch is ready to apologize for everything.
She said that?
In her own old-world way, yes.
Come on.
What are you doing?
I thought we'd walk out on our knees.
Why?
Icebreaker?
She didn't apologize, did she?
Come on, now, I've had it, I've had it.
That's enough.
Come on.
Now, isn't somebody going to say something?
Ma?
Angela?
Fine.
I'll wait.
You know what I think?
That reindeer really know how to fly?
That's enough, Blanche!
I spent a lot of time at that grief center, and I know what I'm talking about.
Sophia, is that $47 the only thing that's bothering you?
It's a big part of it.
What else?
The dress thing.
Why didn't she stop the dress thing?
He's been doing that all his life.
That didn't start with me.
Oh, so it's my fault?
Are you worried that people will think it's your fault?
Oh, it's not like having a war hero in the family.
Angela, was he a good husband?
Yeah.
A good provider?
A good father for your children?
Yeah!
OK.
Now, I know no one wants to hear one of my stories right now.
That's usually a pretty safe bet, Rose.
But you need to know about my cousin Ingmar.
Ingmar was different.
He used to do bird imitations.
What's wrong with that?
Well, let's just say you didn't want to park your car under their oak tree.
No, Ingmar was different.
His mother used to say he brought shame to the house of Hausenfeffershtuledunker.
Anyway, you're all wondering where this story is going, so I'll skip the part where he ran up the stairs and down the stairs and up the stairs and down the stairs and up the stairs Rose, you're not skipping!
Sorry.
The point is, it was shame that kept Aunt Katrina from loving slow Ingmar.
And it ruined her life.
Oh, don't let that happen to you, Sophia.
Let go of the shame.
So what if he was different?
It's OK that you loved him.
I did love him.
He was my son.
My little boy.
But every time I saw him I always wondered what I did, what I said, when was the day that I did whatever I did to make him the way he was.
What he was, Sophia, was a good man.
My baby is gone.
Oh, Sophia.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend"  Thank you, Jack.
I'm Dr. Kelly.
We're going to be talking about mothers and daughters, the dark side.
And we're ready for our first call.
Hello?
Hi, you're on the air with Dr. Kelly.
I need your first name only.
My name is Cher.
And your problem, Cher?
I have a 55-year-old daughter named Dorothy, Dorothy Zbornak.
She's got problems.
First names only, please.
I told you, it's Cher.
Zbornak.
You said Dorothy Zbornak.
Oh, sorry.
So what's wrong with this Dorothy Zbornak?
She's still living home, and she's cramping my style.
Have you done anything in a positive direction to encourage separation?
When I hear her coming, I hide.
Uh, gotta go.
Morning, Ma.
Good morning, Pussycat.
Blanche, honey, are you OK?
Never better.
Why?
I've just never seen you do anything domestic.
Dorothy, I've done the laundry thousands of times.
Oh, by the way, we're out of ble-ach.
Blanche, you dropped these.
Oh, thanks.
Men's underwear?
Getting a little misty, are you, Pussycat?
I don't believe it.
Blanche Devereaux doing laundry for a man?
Not just any man.
Rex Huntington.
Ohh Rex Huntington?
Isn't he the guy who stood you up last week?
Yeah, he did, but I happen to like the man, so I'm giving him a second chance.
That was his second chance.
He stood you up the week before that.
You're enjoying this, aren't you, Dorothy?
Oh, yeah.
Look, Rex and I have had lots of nice dates together.
Maybe he's a little unpredictable, but that's what makes him so exciting.
That and these.
I wish Miles was more unpredictable.
I know where I'm going every night.
Miles and I are in such a rut.
It was never like that with Charlie.
You want to talk about a rut, try spending three nights in a row with this one.
Ma, I thought you liked the lunar landing jigsaw puzzle.
Sure, Pussycat.
It makes whatever time I have left seem so much longer.
I hate to admit it, but my relationship with Miles is really getting boring.
We even make love the same.
How?
Well, first he says, "Let's go watch TV in the bedroom".
And then I think, "Wait, he doesn't have a TV in the bedroom".
And then he says, "Come lie down.
I won't try anything".
And then we have four hours of the most boring sex you've ever had in your life.
Four hours?
I guess it could take less if I stopped playing hard to get.
Ma, you you put Buzz Aldrin's head on Neil Armstrong's body.
I did?
Yes, Ma, you did.
I'm so ashamed.
I wouldn't blame you if you sent me to bed.
Now, right now.
Look, Ma, it's important to be accurate.
Now look at the box.
Hey, Pussycat, it says here, "From ages 8 to 80".
I'm out.
I'm out.
Come on, Ma.
Hi, Dorothy, Sophia.
You kids have fun tonight?
Oh, did we ever.
There's this sewing shop on Fourth Street.
In the back they've got a thimble museum I've wanted to go to.
You could put in a thimble what most people know about thimbles.
Well, no, that's not mine.
They tell that one down at the thimble museum.
You actually had a good time at a thimble museum?
It was sew-sew.
No, again, that was not mine.
They sell bumper stickers out of the thimble museum.
So, Rose, how 'bout tomorrow night?
Hmm?
Dinner at the usual?
And, you know, uh, we've been putting off that trip to Zippertown.
Do you think we'll have time after dinner?
Well, Zippertown is always open.
I'm sorr- That was mine.
Just now, I swear.
Good night, Rose.
"Always open".
Two hours of learning about thimbles from foreign lands.
I couldn't wait to give the headset back.
Look, Rose, have you talked to Miles?
I think this is just who he is.
I don't think I was ever bored for one day when I was with Charlie.
He had a theory - "Even a trip to the bank can be exciting if you wear a ski mask".
He would say that often?
Almost as often as he'd say, "Don't shoot.
It's me - Charlie Nylund".
What's the problem?
Oh, Rex Huntington.
That's the problem.
It's 10:00, and I've been stood up again.
I feel totally unattractive, undesirable and ignored.
Oh, Dorothy, you explain it to 'em.
Well, Blanche feels the way any one of us would feel if we were stood up three times.
Three whole times.
Three in a row.
Ha-ha-ha.
Count 'em - 1, 2 Dorothy!
Oh, I'm sorry, Blanche.
Come on, honey, sit down.
Now, it's not so bad.
Do what the rest of us do.
Sure, our dance cards may not be filled, but at least we can face the lonely nights together.
We're like sisters.
You're right.
Sisters united in the battle against the opposite sex.
See you later, sisters.
It's date time.
Only first, I'm gonna let that man know just how I feel.
Rex Huntington, where ha- Looks like he knows how she feels.
You wait right here.
I'll get my purse.
I won't be a minute.
Don't bother.
It's too late to go out.
We're staying here?
I wish I could.
I just came by to give my favorite girl a kiss.
And since I've already done that, I'll just take my laundry and go home.
Come on, it's not too late to go out.
I mean, you kept me waiting for hours.
No, no, no.
I'm sorry, baby.
I'm tired.
But I'm all dressed up, and I'm wearing your favorite perfume.
Hey, I said it was too late to go out.
I guess you think I come over here to get nagged.
And to get your laundry.
Don't forget your laundry.
Well, Rex Look, I guess I do owe you an apology.
Yes, I think you do.
I got a better idea.
Tomorrow night, I'm taking you out.
I'll call you tomorrow, and we'll decide where.
We'll have a great time.
OK?
OK.
Ooh.
So that's a typical date with Blanche.
I mean, after you cut out all the dirty parts.
You know what the joke going around the teachers' lounge was today, Ma?
Me.
I know that joke.
Everybody heard on the radio that some anonymous "Ma" was complaining that her dependent daughter Dorothy doesn't have a life of her own.
What, you think you're the only gray-haired spinster substitute teacher named Dorothy wasting her life away in Miami?
I'm sorry, Sophia, but in Dorothy's defense, that sure does sound a lot like her.
Hello, Rose.
Oh, hi, Miles.
I was just listening to a song Charlie and I used to dance to.
We've danced to it, too.
Not around a campfire, hoping for rain.
Look, Rose Rose, we gotta talk.
Are things between us getting a little dull?
Oh, let's face it.
You and I are Yawn City, population - two.
Miles, do you love me?
Well, of course I do.
How much?
Well, I don't know.
Lots.
Enough to jump out of an airplane?
Well, sure, sure.
Enough to climb the highest mountain, swim the widest river, jump out of an airplane.
So, what do you say?
Dinner, huh?
Then we'll over to my place and watch some TV.
I won't try anything, I swear.
I have made arrangements for us tomorrow.
Oh?
What arrangements?
We're supposed to show up at the hangar at 10:00 in the morning for skydiving class.
Wha- You mean actually jump out of an airpl- literally?
Oh, there is nothing like skydiving.
I mean, soaring through the air the freedom of it, the whole idea of plummeting toward a pasture and watching a cow get bigger and bigger.
It's just something we should do together before we die.
Rose, could-couldn't I just run toward you yelling, "Moo"?
Too little too late, Miles.
We're gonna jump out of that airplane.
Hey, what do you want for dinner?
Nothing too heavy.
Am I fat?
What, no, "Hello.
Am I fat"?
Dorothy, I seriously want to know.
Am I fat?
Well, of course not.
Oh, this guy Rex is ruining your self-esteem.
Did he say that you're fat?
Not in so many words.
But I am starting to wonder whether "barrel-butt" is really a term of endearment.
Oh!
God, it's Rex.
Oh, Rex!
Why, you're right on time, aren't you, you devil?
You remember my roommates What are you dressed for?
We're going to a beach party.
Oh, I could've sworn you said the theater.
Once again, you're wrong.
I'll go change.
No, no, no, just skip it.
We're late.
This is so stupid.
What's the big deal?
I can go change.
No, there's no time.
You're the one that's going to be embarrassed, not me.
I'll be waiting in the car.
Boy, he makes Wallace Beery look like Adolphe Menjou.
Has been a long time since I've taken you to the movies, hasn't it?
Blanche, this guy has gone past being a challenge.
He is really treating you very badly.
Dorothy, you'll see.
I'm just reeling him in.
Blanche, look, I usually don't talk to you about the men you date.
Nor do I talk to you about the men you date.
Oh, ha-ha.
Listen to me.
I made a joke.
Blanche, this is no laughing matter.
How can you take this kind of abuse?
Abuse?
I'll have you know he has never raised a hand to me.
Verbal abuse, Blanche.
He talks like that all the time.
I just don't pay any attention.
You're making excuses for him.
Look, can we continue this conversation later, when I can find both the time and the interest?
Right now I have a date.
Look, Blanche, I'm only thinking of you.
Well, you know what I think?
I think you just ought to mind your own damn business.
I'm comin', sweetheart!
Sea of Tranquility, come to Mama.
Lunar module, you're out of here!
Yah!
That's it!
Yes!
Ha-ha!
Ha-ha-ha.
Ha-ha.
Ho-ho.
It's just a puzzle, Dorothy.
You didn't make this much noise on your wedding night.
Oh, Ma, Ma, it looks great, doesn't it?
Sure.
Let's bust it up.
No, wait.
Blanche and Rose haven't seen it.
Dorothy, they have dates.
They get to see the real moon.
Oh, I wish Blanche wasn't out on a date.
I just hate the thought of her being with that guy Rex.
I'll tell you, no man would ever treat me that way, and you know why, Ma?
The whole city knows why.
They heard it on the radio.
Rose, how was your date with Miles?
We had a great time.
He seemed much more exciting tonight.
Miles is living every moment like it's his last.
He bought champagne, and we toasted our first skydive tomorrow.
Your what?
We're gonna go skydiving.
You're going skydiving?
Mm-hmm.
A room with a view.
A room with a - I mean, good luck.
Oh, hi, girls.
Oh, Blanche, how was the beach party?
I'm not a big fan of beach parties.
I'm just glad that you got home safely.
Are you still on that Rex thing?
Listen, for your information, he apologized and apologized about the things he was sayin' when we were leaving.
Then he invited me marlin fishing, just the two of us on the open seas.
He says it's the ideal vacation.
Sure.
No witnesses.
Now, Blanche, I know you find Rex alluring, but, honey, I know where you're headed.
I mean, I was once in an abusive relationship.
Hey, Stan was a yutz, but when was he abusive?
Not Stan.
I've had relationships with other men.
Oh, yeah, the evil pen pal.
So, what did Koo Duk Kim say in his letters that hurt my little girl?
No, it was in high school.
Michael Tortelli, remember?
Captain of the football team.
Oh, he was beautiful.
Black wavy hair.
Strong Roman nose.
And he could read.
Oh, him.
He was always putting me down.
Made me feel like I had no self-worth.
Will you stop it?
This has nothing to do with me.
Maybe Rex is right.
Maybe I have gained a few pounds.
Maybe I could try a little harder.
You are buying right into this.
What makes you such an expert on relationships?
This is male/female stuff.
This is what I know.
If I need advice on jigsaw puzzles, I'll come to you.
Seconds after you jump, your chute will open automatically, and you'll lurch upwards.
Unfortunately, not high enough to get back in the plane.
Now, all you have to do is relax and enjoy the view.
The only thing to remember is, when you hit the ground, tuck and roll.
Tuck and roll.
Say it.
Tuck and roll.
Someone didn't say "tuck".
I'm sorry.
I'm a little nervous.
Well, that's good.
It'll keep you on your toes.
Too bad there won't be anything underneath 'em.
OK, we take off in five minutes.
Are you excited?
Dumbstruck.
Oh, I know that feeling.
I just hope I remember everything the instructor said.
You must know what you're doing.
You did this with Charlie.
Well, we wanted to, but - "But"?
"But"?
Rose, the way you talked, I thought you two did this all the time.
Now, I'm confused.
And, you know, I feel like I'm getting smarter.
That's why we're good for each other.
What about all those other great things you two did?
Camping, tennis, boating?
All the time.
Well, maybe only once.
See, Charlie had this unnatural fear.
Of what?
Camping, tennis, boating.
Rose, don't you see?
You're remembering the way it never was.
Then you're expecting me to compete with it.
That's not true.
Listen, Rose, I can't fight a ghost.
Gee, Charlie's not only dead, he's much younger.
Look, Rose, you know I'm nuts about you, but I shouldn't have to prove it by jumping out of an airplane.
I'm-I'm over 60.
Well, so is Paul Newman, and he still races cars.
I don't want to be compared with Charlie, and I sure as hell don't want to be compared with Paul Newman.
Although I gotta tell you, I do make a better salad dressing.
In fact, I don't want to be compared with anybody.
I'm the best me there is, and that should be enough.
It is.
Why, I don't know why I put you through all this.
Now that I think of it, I guess there were times that Charlie was a little boring.
Not that I loved him any less.
That's all I ask, Rose, that you love me even when I'm boring.
Oh, I do, Miles.
OK, it's time to take off.
Let's go home.
OK.
Rose, uh you say Charlie never did this?
I think he was scared.
He was, huh?
OK, Rose, come on.
Let's go for it.
I bet if Charlie had jumped, he'd have thrown in a few somersaults.
Don't push it, Rose.
Well, I have everything I need for the fishing trip.
Plenty of suntan lotion and a string bikini.
I don't want the fish to be the only things nibblin'.
Or floppin' around in the boat.
Blanche.
Yes?
I've been trying to think of something to say to you, some words that would make you come to your senses, and all I can come up with is, "Don't go".
That's it?
It would be wrong for me to keep quiet and let you go off with this guy when I know you're gonna be hurt.
You've had your say, but I do not agree with you, so please just stay out of it.
If you're trying to help me, you're just kiddin' yourself.
Darn it, I forgot my lucky silver dollar.
What do you need that for?
To get lucky.
Hi.
Is Blanche ready?
Not quite yet.
Would you like to sit down?
No.
I'm in a hurry.
She'll only be a few minutes.
Great.
Now we're gonna run into traffic.
I hate it when she does this.
You evidently hate it when she does a lot of things.
What?
Nothing.
I'm staying out of it.
Good.
Do you want to go light a fire under her?
No, I don't think so.
Why not?
Because I think she's getting burned enough as it is.
Would you just go tell Blanche to hurry up?
I've got to teach this woman what being on time means.
Wait a minute.
I don't want you teaching her anything.
You're starting to get on my nerves.
Good, because you're already on mine.
I don't like the way you're treating Blanche.
Under all that makeup and sexy talk, there's a little girl there, and for some reason, she's letting you take advantage of her.
I can't stop her from seeing you, but I'll be damned if I'm gonna hurry her up.
Who do you think you are?
A friend.
This is none of your business.
Just butt out.
You're hurting me.
Stop that!
Are you ready?
I think you'd better go.
Oh, look, look Uh, uh, I'm sorry.
Really, I'm sorry.
Uh Look, sweetie, you know I don't mean these things I say.
Just leave.
If I walk out that door, I'm not coming back here.
That's a promise I'm gonna see that you keep.
Are you all right?
I'm OK.
I'm so sorry.
I don't know what to say.
Honey, I'm fine.
You know, until I saw him grab you, I-I just couldn't see what he was.
Listen, it could've been a lot worse.
Most people in an abusive relationship have to hit bottom before they can get out.
You were lucky.
Your bottom is a lot higher than most people's.
Well, I'm off.
Oh, where you going, Rose?
To see Miles.
Visiting hours at the hospital are until ten.
Please tell him I hope his leg feels better.
Oh, he feels great.
He says a week in bed is just what he needs.
Tell him I'll drop by to see him again tomorrow.
I went by that thimble museum.
I got him a thimble from France.
See, it's got this little man on it, and when you turn it upside dow  I think I'll keep this one for myself.
You know, your Miles is a pretty exciting guy.
I hope you know that.
Oh, I know it now.
You don't realize how much you care for a man until you see him streaking toward the earth trying to grab a bird.
Boy, he must really love you.
Well, I love him, too.
Boy, am I glad I didn't jump.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend".
Hello?
Frank's Flowers?
Hey, Frank!
Sophia Petrillo here.
Listen, I decided the price you quoted me on those centerpieces is too high.
So I thought maybe we could make a deal.
Now, my daughter is single.
What do you mean, "Is she easy"?
You're talking about my flesh and blood.
Oh, you bet she's easy.
Sure, Dorothy'll love that.
OK, Frank.
I'll set it up.
Gotta go.
Who was that?
A florist.
Guess who just got a terrific deal on flowers for the awards banquet.
Really?
Oh, gee, Ma, you know, ever since the two of us started planning this banquet, you have been incredible.
I mean, you told me you got a great deal on the flowers, the caterer, the janitorial service.
Oh, I wish I worked this hard for charity.
You will, Pussycat, you will.
Girls, I just got a letter from my brother, Clayton.
He says he's coming for a visit next week and he has a big surprise.
Oh, that's wonderful.
I bet I know what the surprise is, too.
Clayton's met himself a girl, and he wants me to meet her.
Honey, your brother is gay.
Dorothy, I think that gay thing was just a phase he was going through.
You know, like, when Clay was in high school, all he ever wanted to do was go see gladiator movies.
It's the same kind of thing.
Almost exactly.
Rose, honey, congratulations!
I hear you've been nominated again for the Volunteer of the Year Award.
Yep.
Seven years I've been nominated for the Volunteer Vanguard Award, and seven years I've had to watch Agnes Bradshaw snatch it away from me.
Well, she's not gonna do that this year.
This year, I'm finally gonna beat her.
I'm gonna win!
Why?
Because you worked harder than Agnes?
Because she's dead.
Yep!
As a doornail.
Dead, dead, dead.
Coffee?
Rose, how can you be so cheery?
It's a terrible thing.
Come on, she was 89, and she died in her sleep.
She fell asleep driving the bookmobile.
It was a tragedy.
She was my only real competition.
Dead, dead, dead.
Muffin?
I'll get it.
I'll get it.
Clayton!
Blanche!
Oh!
You're still the handsomest man I know.
And you're still the prettiest thing I ever did see.
Now I know why they call it the "Deep" South.
You remember everybody.
Oh, ladies, it is so good to see you again.
Good to see you.
All right now, baby brother, I've waited all week.
Where is it?
Where's my surprise?
Hello, everyone.
Surprise.
You can just put the luggage over there.
OK.
Clay, I don't have any change to tip the driver.
Uh, Blanche I don't know why you took a cab from the airport.
Blanche You should've called me.
I would've picked you up.
Blanche, this is Doug.
He's my friend.
My very special friend.
Well, any friend of Clay's is-- Ah-so.
Isn't it wonderful that they became so close between the airport and here?
I hardly ever speak to my cab drivers.
Rose, Doug is not a cab driver.
No, ma'am.
Actually, I'm a policeman.
Oh.
Well, what's a policeman doing bringing fares from the airport?
I know!
I bet you do undercover work.
And I'll bet he does it damn well.
You'll have to excuse my mother.
She survived a slight stroke, which left her, if I can be frank, a complete burden.
Why don't we all go out to the kitchen and get something to drink?
That sounds good.
Say, have you ladies known Blanche for a long time?
Oh, yes.
You're in luck.
She just loves policemen.
Apparently, it's a hereditary trait.
I'll say this for Clayton, he has great taste.
Doug is absolutely charming.
And funny.
It's not every cop who can do a good Bette Davis impression.
I think I did a great job covering up how upset I am.
You mean, like how you started sobbing when Clayton asked for more fruit cocktail?
I don't really mind Clayton being homosexual.
I just don't like him dating men.
You really haven't grasped the concept of this gay thing yet, have you?
There must be homosexuals who date women.
Yeah.
They're called lesbians.
Hot damn!
It's happened!
It's finally happened!
Oh, yes!
Oh, yes!
Oh, yes!
I take it we now get The Disney Channel.
Even better.
You are looking at the winner of this year's Volunteer Vanguard Award.
Oh, Rose, honey, what are you talking about?
That award isn't going to be given out until Saturday.
I called to confirm our reservations for the banquet and they said I don't have to pay for my ticket.
The Awards Committee is paying for me.
So?
The Awards Committee wants to make sure that I'll be there to accept the award It's the only logical explanation.
I won!
Oh, Rose, honey, I think you're putting the cart before the horse.
And that's bad?
Look, Rose, I just don't want to see you get hurt.
Oh, Blanche, Doug and I were wondering what's happening with the sleeping arrangements.
Well, I'll be there in just a moment to get you two settled in.
Now, if you sleepy heads could wait just a Sleeping arrangements?
What in hell am I gonna do about the sleeping arrangements?
Well, honey, why can't you sleep on the couch and give Clayton and Doug your room?
Are you crazy?
What will the neighbors think if they see two men in my bedroom?
They'll think it's Tuesday.
They can sleep in Ma's room and she'll sleep with me.
Oh, Ma doesn't get a say.
It doesn't matter what Ma thinks.
Ma's a piece of furniture who has no feelings or opinions.
Nonsense, my little hat rack.
Blanche, I don't understand you.
You can't very well say you've accepted Clayton unless you're willing to accept the fact that he dates.
Rose is right, and besides, Blanche, in this day and age, you should be thrilled that he's in a monogamous relationship.
Of course you're right.
I've just gotta stop this overreacting.
Doug and Clayton are two consenting adults.
There's no reason to be embarrassed.
Blanche, it's such a beautiful night, Doug and I are gonna go out for little a walk.
OK.
Don't wait up.
Well, enjoy your walk.
I'm fine.
I'm OK.
I can deal with this.
Oh, look.
They're skipping.
Oh, God!
Joke!
Joke!
Just a joke!
It's a joke.
I just had the strangest crank call.
Some man wanted to know if I owned a riding crop and a leather bra and if I could lick my eyebrows.
What did you say?
I said no.
I guess we're paying full price for the cocktail franks.
Good news.
Clayton and Doug said they'd love to go to the banquet with us.
What?
Oh, are you out of what is left of your mind?
Why did you invite them?
I want everybody there for my moment of triumph.
And it'll be a lot of fun.
Fun?
Don't you understand?
They will be there together.
But, Blanche, they're here together.
Well, Dorothy, that's different.
We're talking about going out in public.
Oh, what are people gonna say?
Probably nothing we haven't heard before.
Oh, Clay, I was just telling the girls We heard what you were telling them, Blanche, and I am truly sorry you feel that way.
Will you tell me why you want to put yourself and Doug through this?
You know how people can be.
And if my own sister can't accept our relationship, what chance would I have with anyone else, right?
Right.
No!
No, what I mean We get what you mean.
Blanche, we don't have to worry about what the world thinks about our relationship.
It just doesn't matter, because we're there for each other.
I'd do anything for Doug, and he'd bend over backwards for me.
Sometimes I just love to hug my mommy.
I think it's time you told her, Clayton.
Told me what?
I wanted you to meet Doug for a very important reason.
Well, why?
Blanche, we're getting married.
Oh, that's impossible, Clayton.
Brothers can't marry sisters.
Oh, that's right, you're from the South.
Blanche and Clayton aren't getting married, you airhead.
Clayton and Doug are.
Oh.
Oh!
Oh?
It'll be a simple ceremony, just exchanging rings and affirming our commitment to each other in front of our friends.
I mean, it's not like it's gonna be a big, fancy wedding.
Although we are registered at Neiman Marcus.
Well, you have pulled some stunts in your day, Clayton Hollingsworth, but this takes the cake.
I cannot believe what I just heard.
I refuse to have any part of this!
Oh, Blanche.
Oh!
Blanche!
So, Butch, Sundance who gets to throw the bouquet?
And the winner of tonight's Volunteer Vanguard Award is Rose Nylund.
The crowd goes wild!
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.
What a surprise.
I'm absolutely speechless.
Except for the one I've prepared.
Laughter from the crowd.
First of all, I would like to thank all the little people who have made tonight possible.
Thank you, little people.
Smile for the photographers.
Wave to the fans.
Rose, they're about to announce the winner.
I wish Blanche would've come to see me win my award.
Honey, this thing with Doug and Clayton has been pretty rough on her.
Just to bring me up to speed, it's the brother-marrying- a-gay-cop-thing, right?
That's a big part of it.
I don't see what the problem is.
I think they make a lovely couple.
Well, maybe "lovely" isn't the right word.
They certainly make a husky couple.
Ladies!
I think a toast is in order.
Here's to the woman of the hour.
A woman whose grace and kindness and warmth and concern for others is an inspiration to us all.
Here's to Blanche!
And he's mad at her.
Think what he's gonna say about me.
Blanche, you don't know how much it means-- I'm not here for you.
I realize this is a very important night for Rose, and that's why I came.
Just don't mind me.
Um to Rose.
I liked his toast to Blanche better.
May I have your attention, please?
We have now come to the moment you've been waiting for, but before we hand out the award, I just want to thank all those people who made this evening possible.
Especially my daughter, Dorothy.
Dorothy, stand up and take a bow.
If I'm not mistaken, all the waiters were whistling at me.
Maybe they never saw anyone eat a steak that fast.
OK, on with the award.
Oh, God.
This is it!
Good luck, honey.
Break a leg.
Oh, please, oh, please, oh, please!
The winner of this year's Volunteer Vanguard Award is Rose Yes!
hand me that glass of water, please.
Wow!
What a surprise!
Ladies and gentlemen, for the first time in history, we have a posthumous winner - Agnes Bradshaw!
It's a fix!
She's dead!
She doesn't need that on her mantel - she's on her mantel!
Uh, at this time, the Awards Committee would like to ask Agnes' dear friend and our favorite runner-up, Rose Nylund, to accept the award for her.
What a surprise.
I am absolutely speechless.
Except for the one that I have prepared.
Laughter from the audience.
What can I say about my good friend Agnes?
I'll never forget the last time I spoke to her.
She said, "Rose, I don't understand you.
You work so much harder than the rest of us".
And I remember I said, "Well, couldn't this wait just a minute?
I'm reading to the blind".
That's enough, Rose.
Oh, but it's so golden.
Let it go.
Come on, let it go.
Let it go, you loser!
Thank you, Rose Nylund.
Let's give her a big hand.
Honey, I'm so sorry.
Uh, Dorothy, I'd like you to meet Irving Kapella.
He's the one who did the ice sculptures.
Aren't they nice?
Irving would very much like to take you out for some cappuccino and salsa dancing.
Maybe some other time.
Hey, I thought we had a deal.
Ma, what is he talking about?
What kind of deal?
Pussycat, you know how much I love you.
You sold me, didn't you?
I didn't know what to do.
I had no budget.
Oh, my God.
Now it all makes sense.
Why the hat-check guy serenaded me with "Moon River".
Why the chef gave me that extra large cut of beef.
Why the bus boy did that thing with his tongue.
Ma, how could you do this?
OK.
Hey, Irving.
Huh?
Sorry.
Our deal is off.
My daughter doesn't want to go out with you.
But we shook on it and everything.
If it makes you feel any better, I'll go out with you.
Instead of her, I go out with you?
Right.
OK.
It's so good to see you again, Blanche.
And who have we here?
Hello, I'm Susan Dodd.
I'm Clayton, Blanche's brother.
And this is Doug, he's my-- Fire!
Fire!
Everybody out!
Small fire.
It's out now.
So, who's for decaf?
Smooth!
Blanche, how could you do that?
What did you mean when you told me that you could accept my being gay?
Did you mean it was OK so long as I was celibate?
It was OK so long as I don't fall in love?
Doug is a part of the family now.
My family.
And if you don't like it, then you don't have to be a part of my family.
Blanche, I've been thinking about Clayton and Doug, and I have a question.
What?
Why do men have nipples?
I have no idea.
You think it's because God has a sense of humor and isn't as uptight as the rest of us?
It's easier for you to say that, Sophia.
It's not your brother who's getting married to a man.
Hey, it's not like the guys in my family never kissed a man.
Of course, that was business.
Although there was that one hit man who always had to have a flower in his lapel and would hold the kiss of death a little longer than he had to.
Oh, look, I can accept the fact that he's gay, but why does he have to slip a ring on this guy's finger so the whole world will know?
Why did you marry George?
We loved each other.
We wanted to make a lifetime commitment.
Wanted everybody to know.
That's what Doug and Clayton want, too.
Everyone wants someone to grow old with.
And shouldn't everyone have that chance?
Sophia, I think I see what you're getting at.
I don't think you do.
Blanche, will you marry me?
Thank you, Sophia.
I need to go talk to them.
Fine.
But I'll need an answer.
I'm not gonna wait for you forever.
Rose, honey, you feeling better?
I'm still so ashamed.
Oh, Rose, nobody's gonna remember you even making that scene.
When we left, everybody was still talking about Dorothy leading that busboy conga line.
Besides, there's always next year.
Well, I've made a decision.
I'm gonna throw myself into charity.
I'm gonna spend all my free time making other people's lives better.
I lost sight of the real goal.
It isn't about fancy banquets.
It isn't about getting your name in the paper.
It isn't about winning the award next year.
There now, that's the spirit.
It's about getting that dead woman's name off of this one.
We have to talk.
There is nothing for us to talk about.
I wasn't speaking to you.
I have just one question for you.
OK.
Do you love him?
What do you mean?
Well, you see, he's my baby brother, and I've always felt it was my responsibility to look out for him.
So, I can't just let him get married to just anybody.
So, do you love him?
I do.
Very much.
Well, good, 'cause so do I. You mean that, Blanche?
Because Doug loves me for what I am, not for what he wants me to be, or wishes I were.
I guess I deserve that.
I guess you do.
Well, Clay, this is very difficult for me.
I still can't say I understand what you're doing, but I do intend to try to respect your decision to do it.
I want you to be happy.
I am happy, Blanche.
I know.
So, are you telling me you are ready to have a brand-new brother-in-law?
I suppose I am.
Now, look here.
Now, he's not perfect.
Has a stubborn streak and a bad temper And he snores.
That'll just be our little secret.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Hi, Blanche.
Oh, hi.
How was school today?
Ah, pretty good.
Almost half the class came back after the fire drill.
Uh, price tag pinned to right sleeve.
What are you doing?
I'm taking the tags off this dress and saving them so I can put them back on again tomorrow.
That way, when I take it back, they won't know I've worn it.
You're going to wear a dress, then return - Blanche, that's illegal.
Oh, it is not illegal.
It's just wrong.
See, I love the dress, but I can't afford it, not $300 worth.
And I have a late date tonight, so I want to look stunning for it.
Besides, it's not like I'm gonna wear it all that much.
I'm just gonna put it on and take it off.
Then put it on and come home and take it off again.
Dorothy, great news.
Gladys Goldfein called.
She's taking me to see Tony Bennett.
Oh, Sophia, that's terrific.
Tell me about it.
I won't have to spend that evening with Dorothy.
No offense, my little Scrabble-holic, but there's more to life than a double-word score.
Strange attitude coming from a woman who tried to choke me because I challenged the word "flot".
Can you believe it?
Tony Bennett.
What that man does to me with his voice your father couldn't accomplish with his hands.
I know what you're talking about, Sophia.
There are men's voices that get me going like that, too.
Blanche, there are men's socks that can get you going like that.
Hi, everybody.
Hi.
Do we all remember what today is?
I'll go out on a limb and say Thursday.
But you can't go by me.
I'm in and out on my children's first names.
It's the 117th anniversary of the birth of Robert Frost.
I love him.
Always nippin' at your nose.
That was Jack Frost.
Robert Frost is the guy who interviewed Richard Nixon on TV.
Who's the dumb one now?
Ah, you're still the reigning champ, Rose.
That was David Frost.
Robert Frost was a famous American poet.
And when I was with him, he was always nippin' at my nose.
Some people found it obnoxious.
For me, it was a turnon.
Miles is cooking dinner to celebrate Frost's birthday.
He invited us all, and we accepted.
I don't remember ever agreeing to that.
Sure you did.
I distinctly remember you said, "Oh, boy, Miles reading poetry.
Sign me up.
Sign me up".
You sounded pretty definite.
Sarcasm, Rose.
That's like when I say, "You're so lucky to be a natural blonde".
Thank you.
Just forget it, Rose.
I have a late date.
You can leave early.
A promise is a promise.
Now, look, we're all very fond of Miles.
Besides, a little culture wouldn't hurt any of us.
All right, we'll go.
But I'd rather stay home and eat flot.
So overall, then, what I'd say Frost is most significantly remembered for is his simple, clear use of language and uncomplicated imagery to express the quiet values of a rural New England life.
Are we home yet?
My, oh, my, oh, my.
Just look at all the other places to be.
I mean, it is amazing, isn't it, how with a few carefully chosen words, a poet can convey the immediacy of a specific life experience?
You don't have to tell me.
Remember, I grew up in a small farm town.
"Here a quack, there a quack" "everywhere a quack, quack".
Hey, look, there's a black guy doing the news, and it isn't even the weekend.
Ma, did you turn that on?
Poltergeist.
Thanks, Steve.
And Lord knows we can use the rain.
In the news this hour, one of the FBI's ten most wanted criminals, escaped convict and underworld kingpin Mickey "The Cheeseman" Moran is dead Ma, turn it off, now.
Uh, no.
Let's just hear that to the end.
He was blown up this morning outside his home in suburban Chicago by a bomb attached to the ignition of his car, a violent end for a violent man.
You know what, ladies?
What do you say we take a rain check on the poetry reading?
I'd say no dice.
Doesn't "rain check" mean we'd have to come back?
When she kids you like that, it means she likes you.
Ah.
Well, I do have a few papers to grade, and I could use the time.
Here.
Rose, here are the poems I was going to read.
Why don't you look them over?
We'll discuss them the next time we're all together.
So long.
Bye, Blanche.
Actually, I was describing the evening.
Yeah, Burnett?
Miles Weber.
I just heard about "The Cheeseman" on TV.
Can it be?
Am I free?
Hello?
Oh, Gladys, buby.
You what?
Goldfein, I put a Sicilian curse on you.
You'll be barren!
OK, worse - you won't be barren.
And you know what else, Goldfein?
That sandwich I gave you yesterday - it was ham.
Ma, what is it?
Gladys wants to take a man to Tony Bennett in my place.
Oh, Sophia, calm down, honey.
It's all right if you want to drop your girlfriend because a man asks you out.
That's the law of the jungle.
Thank you, Sheena, Queen of the Slut People.
Ma, Gladys is your best friend.
She didn't do this to hurt your feelings.
It was probably an accident.
She must have forgotten that she already invited you.
Let me tell you something.
There are no accidents.
Nobody wrongs someone without meaning it.
Come on, that's ridic- Aah!
Ohh!
Oh!
Oh, I'm sorry.
I was gonna take this dress back.
I am sorry, Blanche.
You are sorry?
Oh, come on, it was an accident.
Or was it?
Well, I will tell you one thing - you are paying for this dress.
I am not paying for the dress.
I will pay for the dry cleaning and that's all.
I told you before, you can't return something after it's been worn.
I certainly can't now after your little spasm.
I wanted to wear something tonight that Duane's never seen me in.
Maybe you should try underwear.
Miles, I thought you were grading papers.
No, I wasn't.
I lied.
Oh, my God.
What were you grading?
Rose, Rose, I have wonderful news.
But I think you better sit down first before you hear it.
OK, you're the professor.
Well, see, I'm not.
No, I'm not really a professor.
What?
And my name is not really Miles Weber.
Well, then who?
What are you talking about, Miles?
Rose, my real name is Nicholas Carbone.
I was an accountant in Chicago, and my biggest client was the dead man we saw on the TV news bulletin this evening.
The Cheeseman?
Yeah, that's right.
You have to believe me.
By the time I found out about it, I was too deeply involved.
I was arrested.
The feds tried to pin everything on me.
You mean - Did they - Have you been to prison?
Oh, no.
I couldn't let that happen.
Can you imagine what my life would've been like if the other inmates found out how much I love to dance?
No, the D.A. offered me a deal, and I turned state's evidence.
Which put my client Mr. Moran away for a long, long time.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Yeah, you're a snitch.
No, I'm not a snitch.
I am an informant.
Oh, a snitch in a tie.
The point is, it all would have been behind me, but he escaped.
The government had to put me in the Witness Protection Program.
Gave me a new name, new job, whole new identity.
I don't know what to say.
I can't believe this story you're telling.
But you can believe the story about Henrik Felderstuhl, St. Olaf's half-man, half-grasshopper?
I'm telling you, when he rubbed his legs together, you'd swear you were on a camping trip.
OK, let me get this straight.
You mean to tell me you are personally acquainted with men who do bodily harm to private citizens for money?
I can't deny it, Sophia.
Yes.
Then take down this address.
Gladys Goldfein, 326 - Ma!
I know this is a little overwhelming, but try to look at it through my eyes.
I have my life back now.
For the first time in years, I've been able to call my friends, let 'em know where I am.
Well, you may have your life back, but I've had the rug pulled out from under mine.
Sweetheart, I I had no choice, but, Rose, I want you to know, the one thing I was never faking was the way I feel about you.
How can I believe you?
How can I believe anything you've ever said to me?
Look, I know it sounds awful, but it's not.
I can be free.
I can go back to Chicago.
And, sweetheart, I want you there with me.
Chicago?
Go to Chicago?
I don't even know you!
Oh, Rose, honey, we know how confused you must feel, but no matter how unfocused your emotions are, you must try to express them.
So just go ahead and cry if you want to, or scream or throw things if you have to, but let those feelings out, honey.
Let 'em fill this room.
Heck!
I know, baby.
I know.
Oh, Rose, this is terrible.
You have been robbed of the most basic sense of security.
No matter what else is happening, at the very least, I know that when I come home at night you are you, Blanche is Blanche, and Ma - if she's taken her medication - is my mother.
I don't know what's real anymore.
When I think of the things I've told Miles, the things he's told me.
The things we've told each other.
Things we've said in a restaurant.
Things we've said on our way to a restaurant.
Things we've said on the way home The two of you shared!
We get it!
But who was I sharing with?
If you say something to somebody who isn't really who he is, have you actually said anything or not?
And if he's heard it as someone he really isn't, has anything you've said actually been heard?
Sorry, I wasn't listening.
She wants to know what to do about Miles.
Drop him.
Ma When someone you trusted tells you something that turns out not to be true, wash your hands of them, give them the boot, dump 'em.
A little bit of Gladys Goldfein slipping into this opinion, Ma?
Who else are we talkin' about?
Now I know how my friend Mary Jane von Helfenpfelfer felt.
Oh, well.
Considering what you've been through, go ahead, Rose.
She took a vacation to Mexico and she found this poor, scrawny, helpless little Chihuahua puppy on the street.
She brought it home to St. Olaf with her, and she nursed it back to health.
She loved it.
She took it to bed with her.
She taught it to fetch.
She'd throw a ball, and he'd bring it back, and she'd throw a ball, and he'd bring it back.
Well, I guess I don't have to tell you that's pretty much what "fetch" is.
How much longer are we gonna circle the airport, Rose?
You wanna bring this baby in?
When she took the puppy to get his shots, the vet told her the bad news.
He said, "Mary Jane, this is no Chihuahua, this is a rat".
And the point, Aesop?
I thought Miles was a Chihuahua.
It turns out he was a rat.
You know, I once prepared a six-course meal with what I thought was chicken.
But it turned out to be a Ma!
Rose, in my heart, I cannot believe that Miles is a rat.
He just fell in with the wrong people, that's all.
Now look, I know you have a date with him tomorrow night.
Keep it.
I'm sure you'll find he's the same caring, sensitive man you've known all along.
My God, it wasn't my confirmation dinner, was it?
Your pop sure made everyone laugh when he made the little feet dance.
Rose, how did your date go?
Oh, Dorothy, you were absolutely right.
It was better than I could've dreamed.
When we sat down to our meal, Nick ordered a whiskey neat and a shrimp cocktail.
Which was positively uncanny, because Miles always began his meal with a whiskey neat and a shrimp cocktail.
You haven't had much experience with the uncanny, have you, Rose?
Oh, Rose, I thought I heard your voice.
I want you to start at the beginning, and tell us everything.
Booze, shrimp.
You're up to speed.
Go, Rose.
Well, to begin with, I had an absolutely fantastic time.
He's the same man, the man I love.
And that's why I told him I'd go to Chicago with him.
You'd what?
You're not moving, are you?
Only for three months so he can clean up some business, then we'll be back.
Oh, Rose, I'm so happy everything worked out.
Rose, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm gonna miss ya.
Your laugh, your smile, your St. Olaf stories OK, I'm over it now.
Gee, Ma, I think it's nice how things are working out for Rose and Miles.
It had to happen sometime, Pussycat.
Rose found a man.
And pretty soon, Blanche will find a man.
And before you know it, you - You should buy a parakeet or something.
Gladys.
Honey, how are you?
Fine, Dorothy.
Is your mother home?
Uh No, I can't say that she is.
I've been trying to call, but she keeps hanging up on me.
You sure she isn't home?
No I still can't say that, no.
Would you like to leave a message?
Oh, I don't know.
I just wanted to apologize.
What took you so long?
Ma, when did you get in?
Oh, Dorothy, grow up.
So, are you reading from a prepared statement, or are you feeling cocky enough to wing it?
I came because I was thinking, at our age, the last thing you say to somebody might be the last thing you say.
So I just want you to know that I'm sorry, Sophia.
I want to take you to the concert.
Buby.
Faccia bella.
Dorothy, learn from this.
This is what friendships are built on - loyalty, mutual respect, trust.
Give me my ticket.
What?
Gladys, you yutz.
These aren't for Tony Bennett.
They're for Tony Martin.
Of course they're for Tony Martin.
You think I'd camp overnight for tickets to Tony Bennett?
Tell you what, sweetheart.
Take Milton.
Have a swell time.
Only this time, don't throw your underwear on the stage.
Then why go?
Oh, why couldn't they put Tony Bennett and Tony Martin on the same bill?
Ah, who am I kidding?
There will never be another Woodstock.
I am never shopping at Fiedler Brothers again.
I beg your pardon?
It's a little late for that.
I've never been so humiliated in my life.
What about the time you lost the key to your handcuffs and had to go with that guy on his mail route?
It seems that before I returned the dress, I was so busy putting the price tags back on, I neglected to remove the dry cleaning tag.
Not only did they refuse to take the dress back, the store manager had the gall to accuse me of being dishonest.
That's terrible, Blanche.
If I were you, I'd take my dishonesty elsewhere.
They made me pay.
$300 for a dress I didn't even want.
Blanche, it's only fair.
You tried something crooked, and you got caught.
Now you're gonna have to scrimp and cut corners and find some way to pay for it.
I already have.
The rent increases go into effect tomorrow.
All except Sophia.
Why not her?
The rent increase was her idea.
So I'm the one musketeer.
I'll make new friends.
You won't believe the horrible thing I just heard on the radio.
Rose, we go through this every time.
"This is merely a test.
In the event of an actual emergency" No, the news!
I was just listening to the news, and The Cheeseman isn't dead.
What?
A coroner's investigation proved that Moran staged the whole thing.
He's alive?
And he knows that Miles is seeing Rose, and Rose knows me, and they always hold the prettiest one hostage.
Oh, if I could just do something to make myself less attractive.
Try soap and water.
I have to call Miles.
He must be out of his mind with worry.
Rose?
Oh, darling, we heard.
Rose, it's awful.
Oh We don't have much time.
I'm so sorry about this, Miles.
Can we get this guy outta here?
I don't want to be killed at my age.
That would be like getting tackled on the one-yard line.
Rose, you realize that Chicago is out of the picture now.
There's no way we can just stay in Miami?
No, no.
That's impossible, too, sweetheart.
I don't know where the government's gonna move us, but all I do know is everything's gonna be fine as long as the two of us are together.
I can't believe this is happening.
Maybe we better try Springfield.
He'd never find us in Springfield.
Which Springfield?
Aha!
Girls, don't worry.
As soon as Miles and I are settled, we'll let you know where we are.
No, Rose, I'm afraid we won't be able to let anybody know where we are.
But we won't tell a soul, even when we come to visit.
You can't visit.
It's too dangerous.
At least we'll be able to phone?
No, I'm sorry.
What about my children?
Rose, it's just too risky, for us and for them.
Oh, Miles This is an impossible decision.
Oh, I love you so much.
Rose, I love you, too.
But I also love my friends and my family, and the thought of leaving I'm sorry.
All right.
I understand.
Oh, I'm gonna miss you, Miles.
Rose, there won't be a day I won't be thinking about you.
Goodbye Rose, darling.
You take good care of her, ladies.
Miles, your poetry book.
Keep it, and when you read page 73, think of me.
"And when to the heart of man "was it ever less than a treason "to bow and accept the end of a love or of a season"?
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Checkmate.
Checkmate?
I thought we were playing Yahtzee.
OK, that's a do-over.
No, that is not a do-over.
You do this every time.
Last time you thought it was checkers, before that it was Battleship, and twice you yelled out "snake eyes"!
No, that was for you.
It was a mascara note.
Anyway, I can get out of this.
The game's not over till the fat lady sings.
I'm singing in the rain Hi, girls.
You're in a good mood, Rose.
Is someone expecting her "special visitor" tonight?
Oh, don't be silly, Blanche.
I haven't had my "special visitor" in years.
Neither have I. It's amazing, when you live with women, you get on the same cycle.
I am talking about your date, Rose.
Who is this secret man you're seeing?
Oh, it's not a secret.
His name's Ray.
He's a friend of Miles'.
You are dating a friend of Miles'?
You scallywag!
You skunkweed!
What's that mean?
I don't know.
What does yours mean?
Girls, Ray and I aren't dating.
Miles is in Europe with some students, and I needed an escort for the Children's Hospital fund-raiser.
Miles suggested I take Ray.
As a friend, that's all.
You're missing a prime opportunity.
Dating a boyfriend's friend is exciting.
Take it from me.
I wrote the book on dating.
Really?
What's it called?
It doesn't have a title, you twit.
Hi Oh, sorry.
Well, good night.
Oh, you going to bed already?
What's terrible about going right to bed?
Hey, Blanche, that's a great title for your book!
Rose told us about this secret date.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Rose has something called a "date," Dorothy.
How can I explain this?
Remember when you went to a restaurant and a man pulled out your chair?
Well, if that had been a date, he would have warned you first.
I thought you were going out with Stan.
I am.
I am.
See you later.
Oh, Blanche, favor?
Oh, Dorothy, come on.
This has been going on for months now.
"I have a date with Stan.
Can I borrow your bike"?
He can't pick me up or my mother'll hear the car.
You think I'm proud of this?
Go on, honey, take the bike.
Thank you.
Dorothy?
I'm just going around the block.
Dorothy!
Oh, God.
I hate what this does to my hair.
What's the matter, honey?
Did you have a bad time with Ray?
It wasn't Ray.
His ex-wife, Myra, ran into the Chowderhead's, where we were eating, and started yelling at me.
Then she grabbed a lobster out of the tank and forced me out of the booth.
How is the lobster at Chowderhead's?
Scary.
So I don't know what to do.
I tried to convince Myra that he's just a friend, but she wouldn't listen.
She won't accept the divorce.
I feel threatened.
Oh, please, that's no threat.
Where I come from, when someone wanted to make a point, they'd tie a string around your finger.
Well, come to think of it, it wasn't a string, it was a piano wire.
Actually, it wasn't your finger, it was your neck.
Anyway, it was very popular.
In fact, piano wire was our village's second biggest export.
You know what our biggest export was?
No.
Too bad.
I don't remember either.
My God, I've left brain cells all over the Eastern Seaboard.
Psst.
Psst.
Where's Ma?
Who?
Ma.
Where's Ma?
In the cemetery in St. Olaf.
Why do you want to know?
Because I thought we'd all go out and toilet paper the Westons' house.
My Ma!
Don't worry, she's gone to bed already.
Well, did you have a good time tonight?
Oh, it was wonderful.
Oh, girls, I cannot tell you how nice it is to be with Stan lately.
He's fun and attentive and sweet.
Oh, even in the bedroom, he's just Well, he's really brought new meaning to the word "solicitous".
What was the old meaning again?
Dorothy, do you love him?
Well, what does that mean, Blanche?
He was my husband, he was the father of my children.
Of course I have feelings for him.
Uh-huh.
Well, what are they?
Love.
I guess I love him.
Oh, I can't believe it.
Of course I don't love the fact that he still keeps his toupee in the lettuce crisper.
But it does look fresher, and you deal with it.
Dorothy, if you do love him, tell your mother.
She's gonna find out.
Don't you think it's better coming from you?
Oh, I guess so.
That's settled.
Now let's get a move on.
Where you going?
To get the toilet paper for the Westons' house.
But remember, we have to be really quiet.
Dreyfuss will bark at anything, and Barbara carries a gun.
Oh, what the hell.
I understand, dear, but we're not dating.
Is that the woman who threatened you with the lobster?
Why are you talking to her?
She keeps calling.
What should I do?
I'll get you off that phone.
Rose, I've fallen and can't get up.
Help me!
I can't help you right now.
I'm on the phone.
Myra Myra, please.
Who's on the phone?
It's that woman from the restaurant.
Give me the phone.
So, uh, you're Myra.
Who am I?
Some call me Sophia.
Others know me as "The Terminator".
Of course, these people have corneas that look like cotton balls.
Maybe I better talk.
Is that right?
Well, listen, Myra, I'm not afraid of you.
I'm from Sicily.
You know what the number one export of our village is?
Ransom notes.
I had a flashback in the can.
She hung up.
She's not so tough without her lobster.
She must really be nuts about that ex-husband.
You'd have to be crazy to want a relationship that badly.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Relationships, Dorothy.
Human relationships.
Remember when that guy asked you to sleep over?
Yes.
If that had been a relationship, you would've been called a girlfriend instead of a dogsitter.
Ma.
I'm not proud of this, but there's something I have to show you.
Oh, please.
I've done a lot worse.
I've done panties over pants, bras over blouses.
One Easter I wore a shower cap over my bonnet.
No, Ma.
I'm going out tonight..
with Stan.
No.
Yes, Ma, I really am.
I believe you.
I said no.
Ma, I've been seeing him secretly for months now, and we're getting close.
I see.
So, what can I say?
Will you do me one favor on your way out?
Will you back over me with the car?
I knew you'd take it well.
Ma, I am going to continue seeing Stan, and there's nothing you can do to make me feel guilty about it.
Where are you going?
Chest pains.
Ma, it's not going to work!
I don't feel guilty!
Dorothy!
Nobody help her.
We all know she's fine.
We all know what she's doing.
God, I hate that woman.
Ma!
I have some news.
I told my mother about us.
You're kidding?
How did she take it?
Pretty well.
Chest pains?
You remember.
Hey, you don't forget your wedding day.
Eat your potato.
What?
Oh, honey, no.
I know it's a very important vegetable to you, but I'm really stuffed.
Then stick your finger in it.
Stan, you pig.
Come on.
I don't ask much.
Oh, all right.
But we're gonna get you a hobby.
Something hard in here.
It's a it's a scalding hot ring!
Oh, Stan.
It's beautiful!
And it's for you, Dorothy.
And it's for keeps.
I am through with the single life.
The ski bunnies, the bar scene.
The puka shells.
Oh, Stanley, please say the puka shells.
Well, you're not leaving me a whole lot of personality room, are you?
All right, the puka shells.
So, what I'm saying is will you marry me, Dorothy?
You know, again?
Dorothy, these last few months have been incredible.
After all the struggling, we're finally into the good stuff.
Let's share it.
I don't know what to say.
Don't you see?
We belong together.
We're an artful complement of individual tastes, enhanced instead of concealed by each other.
And served in our natural juices.
You got that from the menu.
It was the special.
Cajun prime rib.
But I think it applies.
Yes.
Yes?
Yes, yes, yes.
Stanley, I will marry you.
You know, again.
You've made me so happy.
I feel so lucky.
I'm the lucky one.
Dorothy Zbornak is going to be my wife.
I want to shout it from the rooftops.
I just want to tell the whole world!
Me too!
But not my mother.
But not your mother.
What you doing, Rose?
Myra's been calling me at work and threatening me, so I'm fixing a flashlight to walk out to my car at night.
In case she's planning on surprising me.
Good.
Women should always check their cars at night before they get in 'em.
Blanche, that's a wonderful idea.
I was just gonna shine it under my chin to make myself look scarier.
I am really afraid.
I'm gonna call the police.
Well, that's a good idea, honey.
Better safe than sorry.
Girls, girls, guess what happened tonight.
Give us a hint.
The best thing that could happen to a woman.
The circus!
The circus is in town!
No, no, Rose.
No.
It's about Stan.
Well, I was close.
Stan asked me to marry him.
And?
And I accepted.
Oh!
Oh!
I don't know what to say.
Well, I sure as hell do.
Group hug!
Oh, honey!
Oh, Dorothy!
The ring!
The ring!
The ring!
Oh, Dorothy, it's beautiful!
Oh, are those baguettes?
No.
They're little pieces of potato.
He hid the ring in the potato.
Ah!
Honey, if this is what you want, we couldn't be happier.
Oh, it certainly is.
Oh, well, this is great.
And you know what we're gonna do?
We're gonna have a big shower, and a beautiful wedding out on the lanai.
It'll be wonderful.
From here on in, I guess I'm going to have to get used to calling you Dorothy Zbornak.
Rose, you've always called me Dorothy Zbornak.
I know, but I never really meant it.
So!
Another tenants' meeting I wasn't told about.
What's the topic this time?
How to lose the old lady?
No, Ma, we're past the old business.
We're into new business.
Ma Ma, Stan gave me an engagement ring.
I see.
Excuse me.
Ma, that's a microwave!
I know.
I want to get this over with as quickly as possible.
Oh, Ma, I thought you'd be happy for me.
I mean, Stan has changed.
He's made a commitment.
He's matured.
Sophia, he put the ring in a potato.
You're not helping, Rose.
What happened to the commitment he made the last time?
This one's different.
No, it's not.
He'll hurt you again.
A promise means nothing to this man.
You'll give the ring back.
That's my final word.
No, excuse me, you'll pawn the ring.
That's my final word.
"To keep Stan warm on those cold winter nights: a head cozy".
Lois, this is just too much.
Where'd you find such a ridiculous thing?
I make them myself.
And it's the perfect color for Stan.
You crossed your legs.
You lose another sticker.
Oh, Rose.
Rose, these games of yours are absolutely ridiculous.
I can't think of anyone with enough control to keep her legs apart all the time.
More chips?
I just got off the phone.
That stripper you called is on his way over.
Great, I'll start another game in the meantime.
Everybody, pay attention.
New game.
Ugh!
Oh, this is a St. Olaf favorite.
Everybody puts on a blindfold and then they choose a partner.
And then they think of a number and the other person thinks of an object.
And then the bride tags someone and they call out their number and then they switch with her, and so on and so on and so on.
However many switches there are, that's the number of children the bride will have.
And the numbers have to add up and you can collect the objects.
OK, everybody, put on your blindfold.
Everybody wearing 'em?
Yes!
OK, spatula, 11!
Sorry to interrupt.
I got a call from a Mrs. Rose Nylund.
The woman inside said you'd be here.
My God.
You are just perfect!
Now look, that is her right there.
She doesn't suspect a thing.
You got your handcuffs?
Well, yes.
OK, great.
Now look, when I give you one of these Hiya!
you go into your dance.
You got it?
Listen, I think there's been a mistake Oh, my goodness, just look who's here!
Why, we must have the music up too loud.
I'll turn it down.
There's your criminal.
Prosecute her to the utmost of the law!
Hello!
Blanche!
Oh, can you believe this?
The stripper's here and we're missing it, all because of these stupid blindfolds!
OK, Furillo, drop your pants.
It's time for a little search and seizure.
Touch me again and you'll go to prison, lady!
Honk, honk!
Blanche!
Blanche, we have company.
This means you're a real cop?
Yes, ma'am.
The name is Devereaux.
Blanche Devereaux.
Whoo!
Sophia, honey, you really ought to go out on the lanai.
You're missing quite a shower.
I'm not missing anything.
Where I'm from the marriages are arranged by the parents.
Is that what's bothering you, Sophia?
Nobody asked your permission?
It's the Italian tradition.
What do you think Fiddler on the Roof was about?
That's a Jewish musical.
What do you mean Jewish?
I remember there was Enzo Stuarti, Dom DeLuise Boy, I've got to stop seeing these things at dinner theaters.
How's it going out there?
The stripper used to be a cop, and the cop always wanted to be a dancer.
Now they're wearing each other's hats and it's really getting weird.
Ma still won't join us?
She's still upset.
Oh, I cannot believe that she's this stubborn.
Maybe you ought to take a different approach with her.
You know, a more traditional one.
Like?
Ah, I don't know.
Like, um Set up a meeting and have Stan ask for your hand.
In an Italian sort of way.
Well, what do you want me to do?
Go in, bow my head and kiss her ring?
Hey, you know something?
That just might work.
I mean, she thinks of herself as the Godfather.
I'll just make her an offer that she can't remember.
Sophia, thank you for coming.
I want you to know how grateful we are that you are seeing us at this time.
Did I sit down?
Have I sat down yet?
I'm sorry.
No, I mean, am I this short?
My God, you two are like redwoods.
So, as is tradition, I am ready to accept your various gifts and offerings.
You may begin, Dorothy.
I appreciate your sense of ritual, Ma, but just so you know, I still have Shady Pines on the speed-dial.
Moving on.
What do you want, Stan?
Stan wants to talk to you about the wedding.
Are you Stan?
Am I talking to you?
I'm Stan, Sophia.
Over here.
Oh, sorry.
I thought it was like one of those "am I sitting" questions.
Anyway, Sophia, it occurred to me that I never actually asked your permission to marry your daughter, and well, I guess in asking her hand, I'm also asking your hand.
So, what do you say?
Will you be my mother-in-law?
Marrying us both, eh?
So, uh, I suppose one could say six years ago you left us both.
Of course, that was after you spent the entire marriage cheating on us both.
The only difference is, you haven't been forgiven by us both.
So the answer is no.
I don't trust you, Stan.
And where there is no trust, there is no family.
You marry this man and we're no longer family.
You do this, you are out of my life forever.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend"  On the last episode of "The Golden Girls" I'm going out tonight.
With Stan.
No.
Yes, Ma.
I really am.
I believe you.
I said no.
Well, what's the matter, honey?
Did you have a bad time with Ray?
It wasn't Ray.
His ex-wife, Myra, ran into the Chowderhead's, where we eating, and started yelling at me.
I tried to convince her that he's just a friend, but she wouldn't listen.
For some reason, she won't accept the divorce.
I really feel threatened.
Ma Ma, Stan gave me an engagement ring.
I see.
Excuse me.
You marry this man, and we're no longer family.
You do this, you are out of my life forever.
Dorothy, I don't know if you recognize him without his leather apron, but this is Erroll.
He's our shoe repair guy.
I told him you're dying to go out with him.
I'm sorry you made the trip for nothing.
My mother refuses to accept the fact that I am getting married in three days.
So, uh, what are you doin' tonight?
Goodbye, Erroll.
Ma!
Dorothy, he's perfect for you.
He knows your shoe size and he doesn't care.
It's late.
Why didn't somebody wake me?
Because the last time I walked into your bedroom unannounced, some guy missed the trampoline and almost killed me.
That's the kind of thing I don't want you to say this afternoon when we're interviewing new roommates.
Oh, God, it'd be so much easier if she didn't have to meet you people.
Well, I hope you find somebody soon.
Actually, you'll need two new tenants.
I'm not living with you and Stan.
Yes, you are, Ma.
I want you with us, and besides, you can't afford to live alone.
Blanche will let me keep my room, and I have an interview at McDonald's.
If I can see over the counter, I'm their new fry girl.
Rose, what happened?
My brakes went out, and the car wouldn't stop.
My whole life flashed before my eyes and the Nuderflaken twins played a bigger part than I had realized.
That must've been awful.
Oh, it was.
I don't know any Nuderflaken twins.
The mind is a powerful thing.
Think of the 99% you don't use.
I stopped at a gas station and they were nice enough to give me a ride.
Oh, by the way, Chuck says, "Yo".
Chuck from Arco or Chuck from Shell?
Shell.
Big Chuck from Shell or Little Chuck from Shell?
Blanche, I think you're spending too much time at the full-service island.
Oh, boy, I think Myra tampered with my brakes.
Ever since I went to dinner with her ex-husband, she's been out to get me.
What if that's Myra?
I Hello?
Hello?
I can hear you breathing, you devil.
Now, why are you doing this?
Here, here, here.
Just calm down.
Let me handle this.
Hello, this is Blanche Dever Oh, Chuck.
Yo!
Oh, Dorothy, push the doorbell.
The door's open.
I know, but push it anyway.
This is really amazing, Rose.
The other day I was thinking: "Why doesn't our doorbell bark"?
It's probably because we didn't have a "Bark Bell".
I got it to keep Myra away.
You really think this is gonna work?
Oh, yeah, look at the box.
See how the burglar's running away from the house?
And he's saying "Yikes"!
Oh, here, honey.
This is for you.
I'm afraid to open it.
What if it's from Myra?
Oh, come on, Rose.
What if it's got a deadly black spider in it that's gonna leap out and bite me the minute I open it?
There you are.
You're wise.
You're just wise.
Good, you're both here.
Listen, I interviewed a very sweet lady on the phone and she'll be here soon.
So when she gets here, please pretend to be nice.
Well, this is good news.
You've already turned down about 12 people.
They're either too thin or too pretty or too young.
It's like you only want to live with a woman who has no sex appeal whatsoever.
You think we're dogs, don't you?
Now that's too eerie.
The dogs are on my tail again!
Run through the river!
Ma, Ma, we've just put in a new bell.
It's to scare people.
It'll never work.
Hello, are you Truby?
Yes.
Blanche?
Yes.
Come on in.
Oh, thanks.
Thanks.
Meet everybody.
Rose.
Oh, hello, Rose.
I'm Dorothy.
That's Sophia.
Sophia.
Won't you sit down?
Oh, yes, thanks.
Well, who's the lucky bride?
You must be referring to the once and future Mrs. Yutz.
My husband passed just last summer.
Oh Passed what?
A slow-moving Winnebago, Rose.
I hate when I get stuck behind one of those.
He's dead, sweetie.
But, hey, I'm used to it.
I put three in the ground.
Well, what can I tell you?
I like 'em old, rich and barely breathing.
Why don't I show you the rest of the house?
Do you mind if I ask how old you are?
Oh, 'bout as old as you are.
To lose a husband that young.
OK, places!
Dah-dah-dah!
Duh, duh, duh-dum Dum, dum duh-dum Remember, teeny steps.
We're not Godzilla attacking the city.
OK.
Dearly beloved, we're gathered here today to join Dorothy and Stanley in blah, blah, blah, followed by rings, and into the vows.
"Dorothy, I vow to you that my love is pure".
"I do vow, too".
"I vow that my love is strong".
"I do vow, too".
"I vow that I will love no other".
"I do" My God, Stanley, I feel like one of the Shirelles.
"And most of all, I vow that my marriage to my beloved Dorothy will la" Stop!
As God as my witness and in front of this entire congregation, I call an end to this wedding here and now.
Sophia, this is only the rehearsal.
It is?
Pretend you didn't hear that.
I'll see you tomorrow.
We're on the lanai!
Rose, you've got to disconnect those stupid dogs.
But it's working.
And besides, I've already named 'em.
Thanks for letting me move in early.
Ah, great day for a wedding.
Say, who tied those dead fish to the back of the car?
It's a St. Olaf tradition.
You drive until you can't stand the smell and then that's where you live.
Crazy or stupid?
We think it's a mix.
Hey, what's this?
I thought I cancelled the flowers.
I mean, it looks nice.
Sophia, you've got to stop this.
You're hurting Dorothy.
Don't you love her?
Of course I love her.
Why are you doing this?
I'm saving her from making the biggest mistake of her life.
You don't know that.
Sophia, I know you're only trying to protect her.
But let me tell you about a lesson I learned when I was a little girl in St. Olaf: If you hold a bird gently, the bird will stay.
But if you squeeze the bird, his eyes will bug out and Mr. Pet Shop Owner gets very huffy and he won't let you touch the birds anymore.
And the mice?
He won't even let Rose!
What is eight times six?
OK, now that we have a few minutes I think Rose made two very good points.
One: Not all psychotics are dangerous.
And two: Honey, you have to let go.
Dorothy's capable of making her own decisions.
Does any of this make any sense to you, Sophia?
Not completely.
I still think Rose has the capacity to kill.
Oh, Rose.
Sorry, honey.
Pencils down.
I could've used a pencil?
Oh, you just look so beautiful.
You know, this reminds me of the day I married George.
Oh, it was an exquisite wedding.
big, old church and I didn't have any underwear on.
Why?
I just felt it was the right thing to do.
My wedding was outdoors.
February 12th.
I'll never forget it.
I wore the most beautiful white flannel wedding gown.
It even had feet sewn in.
When Stan and I were married, Stan was crying, I was crying, Ma was crying.
All for different reasons, but if you didn't know us, it looked touching.
Oh, Stan and I are getting married again.
I mean, I've done this before.
Why am I so nervous?
I always get nervous at weddings.
Weddings and funerals.
I've been to so many of both I get mixed-up.
Same guest list, same flowers, handful of rice, handful of dirt.
The only difference is, after the funeral it's OK to date.
I'm beginning to like her.
Me too.
You're gonna have a lot of fun together.
Oh, Dorothy, nobody can replace you.
Oh, Dorothy, I can't believe it.
You're gonna walk down that aisle, and you won't be home tonight.
Oh, I'm gonna miss you so much.
You know, the only thing that makes me sad is leaving you and Ma.
Come on.
Come on, now.
We got to get you ready.
Do you have somethin' blue?
Do veins count?
Here.
I want you to have this hanky from St. Olaf.
It's got a little blue embroidery on it.
"Sneeze here".
And you need somethin' new.
I have this other handkerchief from St. Olaf.
This one's never been used.
Thanks again, Rose.
And somethin' borrowed.
Dorothy, I want you to have my best bracelet.
Oh, Blanche, that's very sweet.
It's just borrowin' it, you know.
I'll need it back.
OK.
You can slip it to me right after the ceremony.
All right.
It's an antique.
Give it to me.
Dorothy, you're tremblin'.
Are you that scared?
Yes.
Yes, I'm just as queasy as I was at my first wedding.
Except that I'm pretty positive this time it's not morning sickness.
Look, I'm probably just upset because Ma isn't going to be there.
I just wish she could see Stan the way I see him now.
If she didn't love you, she wouldn't be fighting so hard.
I know.
All right, let's see, you got somethin' borrowed, somethin' blue, somethin' new.
You need somethin' old.
Old enough?
Oh, Ma.
Oh, Ma!
My little girl is getting married.
Oh, Ma, I just wish you weren't against this.
Look how pretty you look.
Really?
Yeah.
Beautiful.
You remember the last time?
We were up all night letting out that dress.
Oh, Ma, you know, Stan has changed.
I trust him now, for the very first time.
Ma, I need your blessing.
It's always hard to let your children make their own decisions, but even though I worry about you, you always do the right thing.
You have my blessing.
Oh, Ma, thank you.
You know, Pussycat, we never had that mother/daughter talk about sex.
Ma, I've had sex more years than I care to think about.
I know.
I think you're doing it wrong.
Sounds like the guests are arriving.
Sophia!
You've got a second chance.
But if you hurt my daughter again, I'll make you miserable for the rest of my life.
And if I lay off meat and dairy, that could be as much as five years.
I cannot take this another minute.
Oh Oh, my God, it's Myra!
This is who you've been scared of?
So, you're Myra.
Watch out, she's dangerous.
Oh, I'm shaking.
You get that too?
What do you want, Myra?
I just came here to tell you I'm not gonna bother you anymore.
You can have Ray.
But you should know you're not the only young blonde bimbo in his life.
I don't want your husband.
I never did.
I understand that now.
I think I was just afraid of starting all over at my age.
My daughter's checking me in to a lovely retirement home called Shady Pines.
That's great.
Come out to the lanai, I'll give you the lowdown on Shady Pines.
You know, who does what for cigarettes.
Here comes the beautiful bride.
Wow, look at you.
You look perfect.
Thank you.
Stanley, I'm a little scared.
I'm not.
I just feel this is so right.
Stanley, I think we're gonna make it this time.
Dorothy, I want you to meet my best man, Marvin Mitchelson.
Oh, ho-ho.
Hello.
Oh, how lovely to meet you.
What an honor.
The honor is mine, Dorothy.
He's a lawyer.
I know who he is.
Oh, Stanley, I'm impressed.
Oh, well, since I made all this money, you wouldn't believe all the friends I have.
How about this guy?
Dorothy, you're every bit as lovely as Stan said you were.
Oh, why, thank you.
Stan.
Yeah, right.
Listen, Marv and I were talking and you know how persuasive he can be.
He said that I should and I thought well, he's the lawyer, and that's what I'm paying him for.
So why don't you?
Why don't I what?
Just sign.
It's nothing big.
It's a little pre-nuptial agreement that says - what's yours is yours and what's mine is mine.
You want me to sign a pre-nuptial agreement?
You want me to sign a pre-nuptial agreement?
Stanley, whatever happened to openness and honesty and trust?
Not to mention the 38 years that I spent as your wife, your partner, the mother of your children.
The woman who held down two jobs while you were at home, staring at a matchbook, trying to draw "Winky".
I told you she wouldn't go for it.
I don't want your money, Stan.
Marvin, give me the agreement.
Ouch!
Weddings.
Why do I always get hit at these things?
Get out, Stanley.
Get out before I need a lawyer.
I think you've got a case.
What about our guests?
What about our honeymoon in Aruba?
I'd be too confused.
Would I be using your money or my money?
Well, we could check with Marvin.
I don't think so.
I love you.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Yes.
Yes, I think I'm doing the right thing.
Please leave.
I have an announcement to make.
I've decided not to make the same mistake twice.
I'm sorry.
She turned him down.
Remember that.
If it's any consolation, Dorothy, I think what there was of your wedding was very beautiful.
And the album won't be as bad as you think.
The photographer got some great shots of your friends leaving with their gifts.
Oh, by the way, I want to thank you for not saying, "I told you so".
When you're as right as I am, you don't have to say it.
Well, I finished unpacking.
It's hard to get a life full of fun into a substitute teacher's closet.
Truby, honey, we have to talk.
I know you signed a lease, but, well, considering Dorothy's tragic misfortune.
I know, I know, but could I just stay a couple of days?
I can't stand another minute in a hotel.
I know what you mean.
If I have to come up with one more fake name.
Mm.
Dorothy, I guess we're sleeping together tonight.
Ma, I have a better idea.
In my suitcase there are two tickets to Aruba.
I think Stan owes us a little vacation, don't you?
Aruba!
I love Aruba.
Where's Aruba?
Come on, Ma.
Get goin'.
We have a plane to catch.
I've got the very things for you to take with ya.
Here, let me get that.
Ugh!
God, this has always been my worst nightmare.
A wedding falling apart at the last minute?
No, going on a honeymoon with my mother.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Well, Dorothy, I'm ready to go to work.
How do I look?
Oh, Ma, you look adorable.
Adorable?
I want to look aggressive, powerful, like a corporate killer.
Lose the hat.
Perfect.
Perfect.
Now you look like the activities director at a retirement home.
Oh, Ma, Ma, your first day.
You must be really excited.
You bet I'm excited.
This was a great idea of yours.
It's given me a whole new lease on life.
I need a raise.
Ma, you haven't even started yet.
I meant help me up.
These new Underalls are choking my pancreas.
Ma, I think this will be good for you.
Mr. Porter seems like a nice man.
I'm sure you'll have a lot of fun there.
And don't forget the money.
I haven't had a paycheck since 1942, and then I blew it all on war bonds.
At least you got it back.
No, Italian war bonds.
I fell for their slick advertising campaign.
"Buy Italian war bonds - the quickest, surest, fascist way to double your money".
Well, let's go.
Ma, you want to make a good impression?
Matching shoes.
They should match my purse?
No, they should match each other.
Hi, Dorothy.
Cooking?
No, Rose, I'm developing pictures from the Magellan space probe.
Yes, I'm cooking.
I was just trying to make conversation.
Don't talk to me like I'm stupid.
Rose, I'm concerned about Ma's first day at Cypress Grove.
Oh, I'm sure she'll do a fine job.
No, Rose, you don't understand.
She only thinks that she has a job.
I worked it out with the owner, Mr. Porter.
This flu has really knocked her for a loop, and her doctor says she has to rest for at least three weeks.
I've been working so much, I figured this is the only way I can get someone to keep an eye on her during the day.
Dorothy, that's dishonest.
She wouldn't have gone for it if I'd told her the truth.
And, oh, like you never told a lie?
That's right.
I've never told a lie.
Well, just once, when I snuck out of class to go to the movies.
It's not much of a lie.
That's what I thought.
Turned out to be the day they taught everything.
The final piece of the puzzle.
Ah, girls, it finally happened.
The most wonderful thing happened to me at the drug store today.
Oh, no.
Dr. Scholl was there in person, and I missed it.
Rose, get new heroes.
I am going to be a model.
There I was, sitting at the lunch counter, and just like Miss Lana Turner, I was discovered.
Well, not exactly like Miss Lana Turner.
You mean she was sipping a soda and you were scarfing down your usual lumberjack breakfast.
Oh, Rose.
Silly, silly, water-retaining Rose.
She was discovered for the movies.
I was discovered by a print ad photographer, and the shoot's today.
Oh, Blanche, haven't you had enough problems with photographers?
Remember the last time?
Sure, the pictures turned out fine, but it cost your friend his party's nomination.
Well I checked this guy out.
He's a pro.
Oh, imagine my face gracing the pages of Miami's biggest PennySaver.
Blanche, all this commotion over a PennySaver?
Well, I know it isn't exactly Vogue, but it is delivered with every daily in Miami.
Oh, girls, what a glorious day.
I just feel so pretty and alive and young as a teenager.
Oh, that's terrific.
By the way, you got a phone call this morning from your grandson.
He got his driver's license.
Ma, look at this place.
It's lovely.
Don't get any ideas, Pussycat.
I'm not getting any ideas, Ma.
You're scheming.
Remember Shady Pines, Dorothy?
"Honest, Ma, this is the way to the new Dairy Queen".
Ms. Zbornak.
Right on time.
Ah, Mr. Porter.
I'd like you to meet your new activities director - my mother Sophia Petrillo.
Activities director?
Surely you remember the conversation we had last - Do this for me.
You promised.
activities director?
Oh, of course I remember.
Nice meeting you.
I'm sure you'll get along well with our, uh, our little gang.
Hi, everybody.
I'm your new activities director.
What's your name, honey?
Sophia.
Sophia, move it.
You're blockin' the TV.
Tough room.
But don't worry, I'm highly qualified.
By the way, what actually does an activities director do?
Basically you'll pop in the video rental, be a fourth for bridge, a buddy.
If you do it well, we'll have trouble telling you from the other residents.
I can do that.
Good.
If you need me, I'll be in my office.
Oh, by the way, couple things you should know.
This is Mr. Lewis.
He won't be any trouble.
He's just sort of, uh, quiet.
And, uh, that's Smokey.
He fancies himself a ladies' man.
Sort of the, uh, the rooster of our little henhouse.
Whatever you do, don't dance with him.
He'll put the moves on anybody.
Smokey, I want you to meet my daughter.
Ma!
I have to go to work, and I don't want you to worry about me.
I'm going to say to you what you said to me the very first day you dropped me off at school.
"See if you can find someone who looks clean to drive you home".
I'm sorry.
It just bothers me.
Oh, Ma.
Cypress Grove has a great reputation.
Did you see the story they did about it on 60 Minutes?
No.
Short piece.
It was just Mike Wallace saying, "Sorry I bothered you".
But did you see them?
Some of those people stayed in front of that TV for eight straight hours.
Of course, throw in a bag of cheese corn, and I just described your Saturday nights.
Ma, Mr. Porter had them resting, which is something you might want to try.
I don't like this whole deal.
Shady Pines - now, there's a home.
Luxury suites, tennis tournaments.
Want a massage?
Dial nine.
And the food.
The filet mignon Oh, really, Ma?
Shady Pines had filet mignon?
One.
They'd throw it in the pit and make us fight for it.
What's wrong?
I will tell you what's wrong.
I took Rose here on my shoot today, and they want to use her hands.
Imagine.
They want to use my face but her hands.
Can you believe it?
This is the most humiliating thing that's ever happened to me.
Ah, how quickly you forget the 1964 Tokyo Olympics.
Big deal.
80,000 people had to wait 20 minutes.
The torch eventually got there, didn't it?
Blanche, I'm confused.
So they want to use Rose's hands.
What's the big deal?
Yeah, Blanche, so what?
So life threw the dumb country girl a crumb for once.
I mean, you're sexy and beautiful all the time.
Let's face it.
You have Bette Davis eyes and Freddie Krueger hands.
Oh.
I have had it with you.
I'm going to my room, and I may never come out.
Is it the weekend already?
Afternoon, Dorothy.
My, don't you look lovely today?
Why, thank you.
Oh.
And don't you look, uh, beautiful, vivacious, exquisite and, uh, uh Let's see.
Breathtaking?
Dorothy, you know, at some point I'm going to have to start questioning your sincerity.
When we get to that point, I'll let you know.
Can you believe it?
I'm beginning to think Blanche is hung up on her looks.
Boy, you don't need lightning to strike you.
No, thanks.
Not again.
Once was enough.
An extra piece of the puzzle.
I'm the one who should be excited.
Imagine.
These hands that once reached inside a chicken for a breech birth will soon grace the pages of a PennySaver.
You've come a long way, baby.
Hello.
Oh, Ma, I'm glad you're here.
I got a call from Mr. Porter.
He thinks you're pushing the folks at Cypress Grove too hard.
Big deal.
One little dance-till-you-drop marathon.
It only took ten minutes.
And what's this about their staying into the night doing homework?
A lot of them sit around waiting for their kids to write.
So I said, "Why don't you write to our lonely servicemen instead"?
I mean, we older folks have to exercise our minds, too.
And don't you forget it, Gloria.
Ma, Gloria is your daughter in California.
Uh, I-I knew that.
A mere dramatization to make my point, uh, pal.
Look, Ma, I know that you're excited about this job, but - It's more than a job, Dorothy.
That's it.
"Dorothy".
When I see them, I see me.
Don't you understand?
Of course I understand.
I know that your heart's in the right place, but No "buts".
I'm not going to sit here while people are forced to throw in the towel.
Have you ever seen what happens to a person when their brain is allowed to disintegrate and their minds turn completely to mush?
Hey, my middle finger's the longest.
Mr. Porter, I came as soon as I could.
I'm glad you're here.
We've got a problem.
It's your mother.
What about her?
I don't know where she is, where any of them are.
She took some of our guests out for a walk six hours ago.
Have you called the police?
I'll tell them to be on the lookout for old people in Miami.
There's a lead.
Hi, Pussycat.
What are you doin' here?
Ma, where were you?
You said you were taking them for a walk.
I know, but we got halfway down the block, and Lucille said, "I want a cappuccino".
The only place I know to get a really good cappuccino is Hialeah.
This is the final warning.
I don't want anything like this happening again.
Mr. Porter, you hired me to do a job, and I'm gonna do it my way.
OK, that's it.
Charade's over.
What's he talkin' about?
Sophia, you're not the activities director.
You're here because your daughter wanted us to keep an eye on you.
I'm afraid we cannot do that anymore.
Ms. Zbornak, please don't bring her back.
Keep an eye on me?
Is that true?
Look, Ma, I'm not gonna lie to you.
This man is a patient here.
He could be dangerous.
Let's get out of here before he starts causing trouble.
Dorothy.
OK, OK.
I thought you needed looking after during the day when I wasn't around, and I knew you wouldn't agree to come here as a guest So you're saying that this whole activities director thing was a put-up job?
Mostly his idea.
Oh, Ma I did it for your own good.
Nobody bothered to consult me about what was for my own good.
So goodbye, Mr. Porter.
Goodbye, Dorothy.
Thank you both for making me look like an old fool.
Ma, what are you doing?
I'm recuperating.
You're watching cartoons.
That's what you wanted me to do at Cypress Grove.
Besides, I like cartoons.
Cartoons don't lie.
Ma, stop it.
Is there something I can get you from the kitchen?
Tea would be fine.
Tea doesn't lie.
Oh, Ma, come on.
Are you saying that you never stretched the truth with me?
Those were harmless lies.
"All first-grade girls wear men's shoes"?
I put bows on them, didn't I?
You do the best you can with a pair of brown Florsheims, and this is the thanks you get.
Dorothy, it finally came - the advance copy of our PennySaver ad.
Bet my hands are better looking than your face.
Bet my face is better looking than your hands.
Oh, ladies, ladies, can't we settle this with pistols?
Come on, open it.
OK.
Oh, my God!
What's the matter, Blanche?
Oh, my God!
Oh, come on, no matter what - Oh, my God!
"Does your face look like this?
"Do your hands look like this?
You need Ponce de Leon Antiaging Cream".
I'd sue.
Dorothy Zbornak, how could you?
Oh, look, they have airbrushed liver spots all over us.
Tell me about it.
You guys look like you should be barking on the front seat of a fire engine.
I really would sue.
Oh, Rose, come here, sit down.
I just got off the phone with the PennySaver.
Now, I think I have an idea, OK?
They have six delivery trucks.
By sheer coincidence, I know two of the drivers.
I'm not worried about them.
They won't show my picture if I don't show theirs.
Now, as I see it, of the four remaining drivers, only Agnes is a real problem.
Now, Rose, here's a part of the plan you may not like.
Oh, Dorothy, did you and Sophia patch things up?
Ah, she's in her room, napping.
You know, it's so ironic.
I sent her to that home, and there she was vital and happy.
Now she's here, and, yes, she's resting, but she's behaving like those people at Cypress Grove - camping in front of the TV all day.
Poor woman.
Do you know what I think the worst part of getting older is?
Your face?
Rose's hands?
No.
I think the worst part about getting older is that overwhelming sense of, "Where did the time go"?
Was it really that long ago I was just a little girl?
Oh, why guess?
Lift up your chin, and we'll count the rings.
Dorothy, I was about to share with you a significant memory from my youth.
It was the evening my mother gave birth to Clayton.
In the spirit of the happy occasion, Big Daddy and a few of his cronies tied one on and went carousing through the streets of Atlanta, looking for some trouble.
Just then, as luck would have it, who rounded the corner but two smart-mouthed New York lawyers.
So, one thing led to another, and, well, Big Daddy and his friends ended up sort of skimming them across Higgins Pond.
It was all in good fun.
Least that was their defense.
Anyway, that was the night prohibition started.
Blanche, prohibition started in the '20s.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I meant probation.
Big Daddy went on probation.
And, uh, the point of this sordid song of the South?
Just that sometimes a daughter has to look after her own parent, as unnatural as that may feel.
Well, it wasn't unnatural in St. Olaf.
We not only took care of our old people, we revered them, honored them, put them on a pedestal.
'Course, that's how we got to be the broken hip capital of the Midwest.
That's a beautiful story, Rose.
Very inspirational.
Now we have to stop those PennySavers.
Let's go see if we can get your hair greased back and find you a flannel shirt.
Oh, great, great party, Sophia, but where's the junk food?
I've got a great idea for free pizza.
Let's call up that 30-minute pizza place, tell them we're a bunch of college kids, and when the guy gets here, one of us grandmas will open the door and say, "What took you so long"?
Oh, it's great to have you back, Sophia.
It's good to be back.
I was getting tired of sitting home and feeling sorry for myself.
They may not have wanted an activities director here, but they've got one.
So what do you say?
Let's get active.
Hey, Mr. Lewis, would you like to dance?
Oh, I can see you've had lessons.
Hey, everybody, it's 10:00.
Do you care where your children are?
No!
Oh, Blanche, there you are.
Where have you been?
My plan with the truck drivers didn't work, thanks to Little Miss Strait-laced here, so I have been in every front yard in a six-block radius gettin' these PennySavers from the paperboys.
She was a woman possessed, Dorothy.
Caught some on the fly, scaled a couple of roofs.
And she had a brilliant idea how to avoid guard dogs.
You made her wear lamb chops again, didn't you?
It's not like they slow her down.
Listen, have you seen my mother?
No.
I can't find her.
She's gone.
I ducked my head in her bedroom.
She's not th- That's it!
She never does what I tell her to do.
It doesn't take a genius to figure out where she is.
I know.
I know.
Wait a minute.
It's true on both hands.
Look.
You put your right foot in Come on, get 'em in.
Get 'em in.
You take your right foot out Let's go.
Let's go.
You put your right foot in and - Hurry up, or we'll never get to the part where you shake it all about on purpose.
Oh, God.
They got into the medication.
Ma, what do you think you're doing?
Oh, look who's here.
Everybody remembers my daughter Dorothy.
Or maybe you know her by her Indian name, "Dances With Nobody".
Ma, come home.
I'll come home when I'm good and ready.
Ma, you have been sick, and I know what's best for you.
Now, I'm taking you home, and nothing is going to stop me.
Damn it.
I should've known it was you.
Please, Mr. Porter.
I can handle her.
You haven't been able to so far.
Maybe I can handle her.
Who are you having a problem with?
You.
Oh, perfect.
I know my every move.
These people are up way too late.
This party's over.
Everybody back to bed.
I danced tonight.
First time in 25 years.
Mr. Lewis, you can speak.
How come you haven't spoken before?
No one was listening.
Not until you got here.
I've been here.
Could've spoken to me.
I don't like you.
Don't you see, Mr. Porter, you're not listening to these people.
You're only as old as you feel, and you're making them feel old.
And, Pussycat, you make me feel old, too, like I can't make my own choices.
Ma, I worry about you, and everything I did here, well, Ma it's because I'm afraid of losing you.
I understand that, but, Pussycat, give me air.
I know you love me, but maybe we can make decisions about me together.
Yes, Ma, we will.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Well, it's unspeakable, that's what it is.
Absolutely unspeakable.
Oh, Blanche, are you pretending you just found your first gray hair again?
Dorothy, just because you have to walk around lookin' like an English lawyer doesn't mean everybody has to.
For your information, I'm upset because I had a date, and he canceled.
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
Was it anybody special?
Well, that's not the point.
He might have taken me someplace where I'd meet someone who is.
You know, it's amazing.
Beneath that thin veneer of superficiality, somehow, miraculously, there is another even thinner veneer.
What am I gonna do?
What on God's green earth am I gonna do?
You can stay home tonight.
We're gonna watch one of those John Bradshaw specials on PBS.
Yeah, we're gonna see if we can't get Dorothy's inner child to shut up.
Good luck.
I'll call Mel Bushman.
Of course.
Mel Bushman.
Old reliable.
Mr. Backup.
How long has it been?
What, three years that the two of you have been insignificant others?
Yeah.
Yes, it has been.
Mel and I have something really unique.
We're like - I don't know.
What do you call it when two people get together when they need somebody but don't make demands on each other when they're apart?
Out-call massage.
That's odd.
He's usually home by now.
Well, he is the zipper king.
Maybe he got stuck in traffic.
Ha-ha!
Tell me the truth.
Do these glasses make me look stupid?
Let's just say they don't hide it.
The consumer show asked me to test these chemically treated lenses.
The theory is they don't fog up when you come in from the cold.
Excuse me.
Rose, you wanna run that looking stupid question by us again?
I'm just doing my job.
Rose, leave the glasses in the refrigerator, close the door and keep your head out here with us.
How will I know if they fog up?
The little man who lives in there who turns the light on and off, he'll tell you.
I'm not in the mood for jokes, especially about the little man.
You know he scares me.
It's really been hitting me lately.
Everybody's job down at the TV station is exciting but mine.
Well, then why not look for a more challenging position?
I did hear something about an opening for a weekend news reporter.
Oh, what am I talking about?
I don't have any experience.
You don't need experience.
You've got the one thing every TV reporter needs - hair that doesn't move.
Dorothy, Sophia, I told the news director I was interested in the reporter's position, and guess what he did.
A Danny Thomas spit-take?
No, he's giving me an actual news story to cover as an audition.
So I was hoping you could help me get comfortable on camera so I'll be ready when he gives me my assignment.
You know, Rose, that's not a bad idea.
This'll be the camera, and let me see you interview Dorothy.
Oh, no, no, no.
Not me, not me Oh, Dorothy, please.
I'm not good at this.
This is a pretend microphone.
It's really just a hairbrush.
All right, Rose.
Ready?
Go!
This is Rose Nylund.
We're here chatting with my good friend Dorothy Zbornak.
Welcome, Dorothy.
Hello.
It's a pleasure to be here.
So, can you tell me what it - Oh.
So tell me, Dorothy, what's it like being a substitute teacher?
Rose, honey, excuse me, but I think you should take another tack.
I'm not saying that my job is boring Say it, Dorothy.
Say it.
No, I just feel you should ask more probing questions.
Okey-dokey.
Let's see.
Ah.
Isn't it a fact that you have a drawer full of retirement home brochures and you're just waiting for the first sign of dribble on your mother's chin to lock her away forever?
She - She's kidding.
Your sock drawer, Dorothy.
You know, the - the one you-know-who can't reach?
I knew you were keeping pictures there, but I had no idea.
You disgust me.
Look, I don't have to stand for this.
Nail her, Rose.
Nail her.
Remember, a good reporter always gets her story, no matter what.
That sock drawer is my business.
Look, those times that Ma makes me crazy, I go into my room and have some pretend time, OK?
This is Rose Nylund signing off in a sad, sad situation.
Thanks, Dorothy.
That was fun.
Girls, I do not know what I'm gonna do.
I called Mel all last night and all of today.
I haven't gotten through to him yet.
Oh, the nerve.
If you wind up having to read a book because of that man Where can he be?
He never leaves the house, not even for me.
What is this Bushman-ia all of a sudden?
This is a man you see, what, five times a year?
A man you yourself describe as "Fred Flintstone with a better car".
Well, I may say things like that, but the truth is Mel makes me feel young and beautiful and special.
When we're together, we laugh a lot.
Why wouldn't you?
You're both naked.
There's more to Mel and me than just the physical, Sophia.
We share things.
I couldn't be intimate with just anybody.
Oh, yeah?
What about the guy who painted our address on the curb?
You make it sound like it was a one-night stand.
He'll be back when it's faded.
Honey, Mel's probably just busy with work, not answering the phone.
You'll reach him.
You always do.
Dorothy's right.
You're worrying for nothing.
I remember back in St. Ol- Hold it right there, Will Rogers.
None of us is in the mood to hear one of those St. Olaf stories.
Well, then, here's one against your will.
But to show you I'm a good sport, I'll get right to the part that'll make Blanche feel better.
Ah.
Anyway everybody in the village hated Ingmar.
So we grabbed our torches and climbed the hill to his castle and pounded on the great oak door, but there was no answer.
So we got a ladder, climbed up to the window, and we peeked in, and to our relief, there was Ingmar lying on the - Oh, wait a minute.
He was dead.
Oh, my God, Dorothy, what if she's right?
What if something's happened to Mel?
Good going, Rose.
Girls, I'm frightened.
You gotta go with me.
I gotta go check on Mel.
Oh, of course, honey.
But I'm telling you, you have nothing to worry about.
Way to go, Rose.
I thought you said that story would help.
Well, it did.
You don't know how long I've been waiting to get that one off my chest.
Oh, my God.
There must be two weeks' worth of papers here.
Now calm down honey.
This doesn't say "dead".
It says OK, let's get this over with.
Maybe we better think this over.
We don't have any right to go breaking into somebody's home.
We're not breaking in.
I have a key.
Let's see.
"Baldwin," "Baxter" Ah, here it is.
"Bushman".
No.
Oh, that's Al Bushman.
Here we go.
"Mel Bushman".
You know, girls, I've been thinkin'.
Ever since Mel and I met, I always figured he'd be around when I needed him, but I never thought about his needs.
All I cared about were mine.
I just always figured he'd be available, and he was.
Oh, girls, he's always been there for me.
I just took him for granted.
Oh, honey, honey, don't do this to yourself.
You take everyone for granted.
Thank you, Dorothy.
Well, so far nothing seems out of place.
Look at this Exercycle.
It's never been used.
Oh, yeah, we've been on it.
Don't ask, Ma.
Oh, Dorothy, look.
The zipper king's one millionth zipper.
Ohh.
I will never be able to look at another zipper without thinkin' of Mel.
Let it go, honey.
Let it go.
Mel, is that really you?
!
No, it's Claus Von Bulow.
Oh, Mel, it's great to see you.
Blanche thought you were dead.
She did?
I love it.
What makes you think something could kill Mel Bushman?
Where have you been?
I was on a vacation.
What's the big deal?
What made you think I was dead?
If Mel Bushman doesn't answer my call, then something must be wrong.
You weren't there when I needed you.
You're always there when I need you.
Well, when you deliver such services, every once in a while, a man's gotta take a vacation.
All that matters now is you're alive.
You're alive, and we're together, and I'm never gonna let you go.
Tell me she's being dramatic.
When I thought I would never see you again, I began to realize just how much you meant to me and how much I've taken you for granted and how many things I never had a chance to say to you.
What I'm trying to say is I realize how much you mean to me and that I don't need anybody else.
I wanna be a one-man woman, and you're it.
Mel Bushman, I love you.
I'm all ready for my big date.
What big date?
You're going out with Mel Bushman.
I know.
Isn't it wonderful?
Tonight, Mel and I are starting a brand-new relationship.
Do you realize how rare it is to find out the person you've been sleeping with is the person you love?
No, but you can't go by me.
I have morals.
Oh.
Girls, great news.
I got my assignment, and it's a biggie.
Oh, yeah, a biggie.
Real big.
Big, big, big.
Cat show?
Dog show.
Miami's 13th annual.
Oh, that's right, ladies.
This afternoon, I'm gonna get the scoop on man's best friend.
Oh, congratulations, honey.
I know you're gonna do a great job.
Oh, I just wish my mother and father were here to see this.
Because they'd be so proud of you?
No, because they'd be alive.
Oh!
My God, I've got goose bumps.
Mel will be here any minute.
Why are you so jumpy?
You've been out with Mel a thousand times.
I know, but now there's more at stake.
Everything's changed.
It's all new and exciting.
In many ways, I feel just the way I felt when I was a virgin.
You mean, the feeling isn't gonna last long?
Are you implying I lost my virginity at an early age?
I'm just saying you're lucky Jack and Jill magazine didn't have a gossip column.
Ma!
Please, Pussycat, I'm on a roll.
I'm sorry, Sophia, but I am not gonna let your skepticism ruin my entire evening.
Mel and I were meant to be together.
I wish I could say the same for your thighs.
God, I'm hot tonight.
I'm not gonna stand for this.
Take it, Dorothy.
But I'll bet you'll lay down for it.
Well, that was just plain rude.
Some people just don't know when to quit.
Look how they pamper these dogs.
They eat when they want to, sleep when they want to, go to the bathroom anywhere they - Hey, I do have it pretty good.
Now, if I could just get you to crack the window when you lock me in the car Ma, stop it.
Now, I want you to behave yourself.
We're here to give Rose moral support on her big day, and I don't want you doing or saying anything to embarrass her.
Hi, girls.
Oh, hi, Rose.
This is Andy.
He's my cameraman.
Andy, these are my friends.
Where do you think we should set up?
I'm not sure, Mrs. Nylund.
To tell you the truth, this is my audition, too.
How about over there?
Whatever you say.
Whatever you say.
The blind videotaping the blind.
Here goes.
And we're rolling.
We're here at the 13th annual Miami Pet Dog Expo, where you're going - All right, everybody, hands up!
All right, you, behind the desk, I want the cash.
Everyone else, I want wallets and jewelry!
Move it!
For God's sake, we've gotta do something.
But he's got a gun.
What are we gonna do?
I'm gonna do the only thing a good reporter can do.
Get the story no matter what.
All right, now you just point your camera and do exactly as I say.
Give me the ring.
Yes!
Hurry up!
This'll be far enough.
Thanks very much for making this evening a total disaster.
Sweetheart, give yourself some credit.
It wouldn't have been a total disaster without you.
Oh really, Mr. "No Guy With an Earring Parks My Car"?
My God.
You'd think an elegant restaurant like that would bring out the best in a man.
What it brought out was $250 from my wallet.
It was a special occasion.
Where I come from, $250 is 5 special occasions and a bottle of Scotch.
You'd think for all that money, they'd hang a picture on the wall.
The minimalist dÃ©cor is designed to enhance conversation.
Nothing to look at, what's to talk about?
I would think I would be enough.
Talk about you?
We didn't have to go out on a date to do that.
You think I'm borin'?
No, sweetheart, I think you're fantastic.
With a guy like me, a little fantastic goes a long way.
I mean, look what we got now.
Every couple of weeks you call me when one of your boyfriends don't show up.
I tell ya, "Bushman awaits".
We rent a movie, we order some takeout, we talk about you.
That's entertainment.
I love that.
And we cuddle.
Sometimes we do more than cuddle.
Sometimes you stay.
That's the part I like the best - when you stay.
Every couple of weeks, you bring a little class to Bushman's place.
Why, Mel Bushman, are you sayin' you love me?
Yeah.
I love you.
I love you the way we are now.
But, sweetheart, you start with relationships and love, and I gotta put on a tie twice a week to eat food I can't even see I mean, we got a problem.
I guess that without thinkin' about it, you've become a very comfortable part of my life.
When I thought you were gone, suddenly life wasn't so comfortable anymore.
I really missed you.
Nah, you missed knowing Bushman awaits.
Mm.
Hey, I haven't spent this much time thinking about feelings since we rented the Alan Alda collection.
Mel, I think it's pretty obvious our new relationship just isn't gonna work out.
I don't think so.
Why don't we call it off and go back to being friends?
I got a great idea.
Why don't you come over to my place?
I'm hungry.
I'll go to Wolfie's, get some pastrami.
We can rent Out of Africa.
We've rented it five times and never made it through to the end.
I know, but it always works.
I do love you, Mel, as a friend.
Like I said, sweetheart, you got a lot of class.
Life sucks.
Hi, Mel.
You run on home, and I'll be over soon as I check on Rose.
Bushman awaits.
I didn't get it.
What?
I didn't get the job!
Oh, Rose, your little dog show not go well?
I'm so sorry.
Let's talk about me, then.
Blanche, Rose did something absolutely incredible tonight.
There was a robbery at the dog show.
Ma and I were held hostage.
Rose was the only reporter there.
Well, shoot, I missed everything.
Let's see the tape.
OK.
This is Rose Nylund for Channel 8 News here at the Miami Pet Dog Expo, and I am an eyewitness to something shocking  people who look like their dogs.
I said keep quiet and don't move!
That handsome fella you see back there with his hand in the air is Brian Kingsley of Boca Raton.
With him is his best buddy Barney, a basset hound you'd swear was a member of his family.
As we move closer, you'll notice Barney's collar matches Brian's Rolex.
What do you think so far?
I'm glad I wasn't there.
TV does put 10 pounds on you.
I'm here beneath the information table with Bill Peterson and his similarly profiled bulldog Churchill.
It's amazing.
That bulldog could be your brother.
But I guess you get that a lot.
Actually, I do.
Uh, could we discuss this later?
Wow.
Oh, thank you, Blanche, but there's more.
The police have just informed me that there was also a robbery by an unidentified man.
Perhaps this little fella knows who he is.
I did that last part after everything quieted down.
I thought it would kinda tie things together.
Wow.
You didn't cover the robbery at all?
Was I wrong again?
I mean, I could have covered the holdup, but it would have seemed like I was giving in to sensationalism.
I'm a reporter, damn it.
They sent me to cover a story, and that's what I did.
I don't believe this.
Rose, this was the opportunity of a lifetime, a one-in-a-million shot.
How could - How could - How could they not have given you the job?
Maybe the issue here is one of - Oh, God, what can we call it?
Editorial judgment.
Really?
You think so?
Oh, yes, Rose.
Yes, I do.
I guess it just isn't the story they wanted.
Damn, you're good.
Thank you, Dorothy.
That makes me feel so much better.
To tell you the truth, I'm still not ashamed of what I did today.
If Deborah Norville stopped for every serious news story that happened around her, she wouldn't be where she is today.
Well, Bushman awaits.
You know, I learned something tonight.
A relationship is more than sex and fun and videos and good times.
Thank God this isn't a relationship.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Oh, morning, Ma.
Dorothy, when was the last time you had sex?
It's a very personal question.
That long, huh?
Perfect.
Then you shall be the queen of the Festival of the Dancing Virgins.
Ma, what are you talking about?
Once a year, the women of my village threw a festival to recapture their virginity.
It gives you a chance to say to the man in your life, "What kind of tramp do you take me for"?
We had a Festival of the Dancing Virgins in St. Olaf, too.
Every year, we'd go down to the lake, and they'd be flopping around on the dock.
Oh, no, wait.
That was the Festival of the Dancing Sturgeons.
What is wrong with you, woman?
OK, Queenie I have to make salsa grandioso again, and this time, I'm gonna teach you how.
Oh, Ma.
Not the sauce, Ma, no.
That takes weeks.
There are 152 ingredients.
I just don't have the time.
Dorothy, for 1400 years, the women in our family have been handing this recipe down from mother to daughter.
Each generation improves upon it in some way.
Like, for instance, it was my great-grandmother who added heat.
What did you add, Sophia?
A mouthful of wine.
It was an accident.
A delicious accident.
Well, Ma, I just can't do it now.
I'm gonna be teaching that honors program class, and it's going to be a challenge.
I'm gonna have students who know that Chekhov is a brilliant Russian playwright, not the guy who was the navigator on the Enterprise.
I didn't know the guy from Star Trek wrote plays.
So, what you're telling me is I'm gonna take this recipe with me to the grave.
Right along with the secret of why Uncle Gino legally adopted that goat.
Sophia, why don't you teach me the recipe?
I'm practically a daughter.
You have to hand it down to a blood relative or the queen of the festival.
When was the last time you had sex?
A couple of weeks ago.
Let's not split hairs.
Congratulations.
You're the queen.
I'm the quee-- I'm the queen?
You're also the fool, so we're saving a lot on payroll.
Aw, leave her alone.
We have to get to work on the sauce.
We begin by taking a shallow bath in olive oil at 7:34 Sicily time.
Why?
Originally it was to keep the Visigoths away.
But if ain't broke, don't fix it.
Am I convincing?
As what, ye olde towne slut?
It so happens our community playhouse is doing The Taming of the Shrew, and I'm to audition for the role of Kate, the fiery tart of Padua who no man could tame.
Hark.
Perhaps a suitor doth approacheth.
Do you think he'll thtay all night?
Rebecca, what a surprise.
Look at you.
And you used to yell at me for wearin' halter tops.
Mama, I just got a job interview, and I really need you to baby-sit for Aurora.
Aurora.
I just hate that name.
Why couldn't you have found something more musical, more - more Southern, more beautiful?
Sorry, Blanche.
Look, I know you don't like the name, and I know you think I'm bringin' her up wrong.
No, I just don't see why you have to feed her when you come to visit me at the museum.
You don't see me taking out my breast in public.
A lot.
I'd love to stay and argue with you, but I have to go.
You know how much I wanna be with Oreo, but Aurora, Mama.
Aurora.
I just have such a block against that name.
Rebecca - You promised if I moved to Miami you'd help me out, and I really need this job.
Oh, here.
You have a good time with Grandma.
Rebecca!
Will you stop sayin' that?
You keep callin' me "Grandma," she's gonna grow up to think that's my name.
yours if you talk of tales, and so, farewell.
Thank you.
Would you like to see Kate another way?
God, yes.
Next!
Blanche Devereaux.
Hi.
Larry, is that you?
No, Larry's not directing this one.
He's sick.
His back didn't go out again, did it?
How did you know?
I performed Annie for him.
Really?
Where?
None of your business.
OK.
Jason will be your Petruchio, page 85.
"Myself am moved to woo thee for my wife".
"Moved?
In good time, let him that moved you hither move you hence".
All right, all right, all right.
"I knew you at the first.
You were a moveable".
Thou hast hit it.
Come, sit on me.
Ooh.
Oh.
"Asses are made to bear, and so are you".
Women are made to bear, and so are you.
Shh, shh, shh.
"No such jade as m-- you if me you mean".
OK.
I've heard enough.
Thank you.
Oh, please.
I've waited my whole life to play this part.
Long wait.
Thank you, Miss Devereaux.
Let's take a five.
Oh, shoot.
Well, I thought you were great.
Oh!
Well, uh, I was born to act.
I've given some of my best performances on the stage.
And what about this little lady?
I bet her daddy is very proud of her.
She doesn't have a daddy, do you, sweetheart?
Really?
Well, she has a very talented mother.
How do you know?
I just saw her act.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
And your name was?
Jason Stillman.
Did you happen to see Breakfast At Tiffany's?
Yes.
Well, I was in the party scene.
Audrey Hepburn spilled a drink on me.
But they cut it out.
I'm impressed.
I've settled here in Florida recently.
Oh.
Maybe you and your daughter could join me for an afternoon at the zoo one day soon?
My daughter and I would love that.
I'll give you a call.
Are you in the book?
Bold print.
Hi, Pussycat.
How was school?
Oh, I hate those smart kids.
They may be our brightest, but they're also our rudest, considering most of them are guests in our country.
Oh, give me a class of red-blooded underachievers.
Pussycat, when you were in junior high school and the kids gave you a hard time, what did I say?
You told me I was extra-special and they were just jealous.
That's right, and if they still gave you a hard time, what did I tell you to say?
"My mother can have you eliminated with one phone call".
But, Ma, this is different.
I've always wanted to teach an honors class, but now that I am, well, the kids are making me feel stupid.
Dorothy, I'm gonna tell you something I never told you before.
When you were about 12 and we lived in Brooklyn, they called me into the school to tell me you had the highest IQ in the borough.
That's a coincidence.
I was told I had the IQ of a burro.
Ma, I had no ide-- The brightest kid in Brooklyn?
Well, that certainly explains the feeling of being right all the time.
What is it?
I don't know if you know this, but a burro can find its way back home.
Have fun shopping, Rose.
Oh, I'll be back.
Oh, Dorothy, what crossword puzzle are you doing?
Sunday New York Times'.
In ink.
Isn't Rebecca here with the baby yet?
She called and said she'd be a little late.
You know, Blanche, it's so nice to see you take this much of an interest in your granddaughter.
Well, I have to.
Jason thinks the baby's mine.
Well, don't look at me that way.
He thought the baby was mine.
I just didn't correct him.
It's not a lie.
I'm-I'm just withholding the truth.
Blanche, how could you do that?
Because over the past couple of weeks, I've really gotten to like him.
If I go back now and tell him the truth, he'll think I'm a liar.
Oh, what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to tell a fib.
Walt Whitman here has a point.
What's with this guy?
He must be blind as a bat.
There are lots of ways you can trick a man into thinkin' you're younger than you really are.
You wear sunglasses, put on a little extra makeup, go to dimly lit restaurants.
We've all done that.
Fly to Nevada to get a fake birth certificate.
Have a phony high school yearbook printed up.
Change the dates on your parents' graves.
We've all done that.
Wonder if that's Jason.
Listen, I'm warnin' you, if anybody blows the whistle on me, the old lady's out on the street.
Rose, go in the other room and cry like a baby.
Get.
Go!
Move it.
She owns us.
Jason.
Blanche.
I really wanna thank you again for these ray blockers.
I didn't think I'd get used to everything being pink, but it's kinda fun.
I guess we oughta be on our way.
Honey, Alligator Grotto has been there a thousand years.
It can wait another few minutes.
Good afternoon, ladies.
Why don't you take the glasses off and stay a while?
Yoo-hoo, gotta go.
Where's the baby?
The baby's sleeping.
Let me take a peek.
At the Greater Miami Baby Sleep Center.
It's sort of a flophouse for infants.
Oh, that must be the baby and her nanny now.
Hi, everyone.
Sorry I'm late, but you'll never guess what happened today.
Tell me later.
Give me the baby and leave.
She said, "Mama".
Ah.
Too bad, Blanche, that you weren't there.
Yeah, too bad, but I'm sure she'll say it again.
OK, let's go.
Wait.
Let me get a picture.
Isn't she the most beautiful mother you've ever seen?
Grand, just grand.
You know, Blanche, this is like a perfect family.
Well, almost perfect.
Maybe someday there'll be room for me.
And who knows maybe even a little one of our own.
And a pinch of red pepper That's not a pinch.
Did you ever get pinched by an Italian?
It takes about five minutes.
Hi.
What are you doin' up?
You have school tomorrow.
Oh, I'm just too smart for my own good.
I feel as trapped and isolated as Soren Kierkegaard in his final days.
What?
That's such a funny name.
Oh, Rose, dear, sweet, single-digit-IQ Rose.
Oh, I've been tossing and turnin'.
I can't sleep.
I don't know what I'm gonna do about Jason.
He's reached a point in his life where he's anxious to settle down.
He wants us to have another child right away.
Well, frankly, I don't know if I want another baby so soon.
I understand.
Wait a couple years, and Medicare will pay for it.
Why wait?
Have it now and The Enquirer will pay for it.
It's so unfair.
We're both about the same age, but he can go on makin' babies the rest of his life.
I feel like the Spruce Goose.
People may visit, play with the controls, but I'll never really fly again.
Hello!
And how is little Aurora doing today?
Oh, what a good girl she was this mornin'.
She was just smilin' and smilin' and smilin'.
I know sometimes it's just gas, but she was so cute.
Ma, it's not cute once you pass 80.
Oh, I thought I heard company.
Come here, you.
Aurora just got up, so you may not be able to put her down for a nap this afternoon.
That's all right.
I enjoy it when she's awake.
Mother, this is so unlike you.
You've never really liked babies.
Rebecca, go home.
You're interfering in my and the baby's bondin' time.
Before I go, I just wanna say it's been wonderful seein' the open, honest and lovin' relationship you're havin' with Aurora.
You've been great.
I love you, Mama.
Wait.
I'm not as perfect as you think I am.
There's something you oughta know.
Hi.
I hope I'm not too early.
You're right on time.
There's something I wanna tell you.
I'm not the baby's mother.
I'm her grandmother.
I don't believe this.
I should have told you sooner, but when we first met, I was very attracted to you, and I couldn't believe you thought I was the baby's mother.
What were you thinkin' of?
Well, I thought, "Who am I to judge"?
I was bald at 23.
Well, I guess this puts an end to our relationship.
You probably don't want to go out with a grandmother.
No, I'd-- I'd go out with a grandmother.
I don't want to go out with someone I can't trust.
Goodbye, Blanche.
Well, that's that.
No use cryin'.
Shall we take the baby to the park?
Why?
So you can pick someone else up?
I really thought you were gettin' to love Aurora, but you were just usin' your granddaughter to try and land a man.
Goodbye, Mama.
Thanks for baby-sittin'.
You won't have to do it again.
Oh, good, you're home for the Festival of the Dancing Virgins.
The sauce is almost ready.
I'm not staying for dinner tonight.
There's a meeting at Mensa.
That's the organization for people with high IQs like mine.
You know, in St. Olaf we had a chapter of Mensa, and across the room was Girlsa.
No, wait, those were the bathrooms at St. Olaf's only Italian restaurant.
Hold it, Dorothy.
Not stay for dinner?
Not stay for the sauce?
Miss the whole festival?
Where's your sense of family, your sense of tradition?
Ma, it's just that I want to be around my intellectual peers.
I got bad news for you, Pussycat.
You are.
I made up your IQ.
I wasn't the brightest kid in Brooklyn?
So I lied.
Did it help you get along with your honors class?
Yes, but Ma, you lied to me.
Tooth Fairy, Santa Claus, Easter Bunny.
I've been messin' with your head for almost 60 years.
I guess you don't feel like Sorten Kareerdybarten now.
That's Soren Kierkegaard.
I got her to say it again.
What's goin' on?
Oh, good, trollop.
Everybody grab a rock.
Go on, throw 'em.
I don't care anymore.
Oh, honey, you still that upset about Jason?
I'm not upset about him.
I would never get that upset about a man.
Rebecca called, asked if she could come over and get the baby's things.
I asked her if we could talk.
She said we have nothin' to talk about.
And we have so much to talk about.
The trouble is, we always end up fightin'.
Look who's here!
Oh, Sophia, see if you can get them to stay for dinner.
No, really, thank you.
I just came by to pick up a few things.
There's just plenty of food.
Thank you anyway.
I'll get the baby's things.
Come on, it's 6:30.
We're already five minutes behind schedule.
Rose, before you bring in the sauce, tell us what ingredient you added.
I don't want to spoil the surprise.
I'll give you a hint.
They're sugary and they're grrrrreat!
Dorothy, you're gonna have to do the Dance of the Virgins by yourself.
Ma!
You remember.
It's like the bunny hop, except you keep your legs crossed.
Ma, you're making this up.
I'm adding to it.
Once every year, the women of my family got together.
They danced, they laughed, they ate.
It was a celebration of mothers and daughters.
Don't turn your back on your mother, Rebecca.
Don't let your little girl grow up without a grandmother.
I'm 85, and I still cherish all the memories that I had with mine.
I think I've got everything.
Can I kiss Aurora goodbye?
No.
No?
We're not goin' anywhere.
Give me that baby.
Ohh.
Ohh.
On with the feast.
Oh, Ma, I may not have an IQ of 173, but I know what you mean by continuity and family.
And next year, I want to learn the sauce.
Deal, Pussycat.
It's not that hard.
First you get one large pot, a dozen plump tomatoes and one moron to do all the work for you.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Well, I'm off.
That would be my diagnosis.
No, I mean I'm going out.
Ma, put down the binoculars.
No, I need them.
I lost my glasses, and I'm not supposed to drive without them.
Let's analyze this for a moment.
You're now what, about 200 years old?
About.
You have no license.
You're not allowed to drive.
Curses!
Dorothy, good, I'm glad you're here.
I want you to help me go through these papers.
They're to authenticate my family tree.
Oh.
Tomorrow I have to present it out loud at the "Daughters of the Old South" initiation banquet.
You're not really gonna go through with this, are you?
Well, indeed I am.
This club is a link to the proudest of all heritages.
I remember, growin' up in Atlanta, how us girls used to pretend to be Confederate belles, and we'd receive gentleman callers.
Got to be like a competition.
In fact, I once received seven callers in one evening.
I'm just thinking out loud, but isn't Atlanta where the Center for Disease Control is?
Coincidence.
Hey, these are all right.
When I look through them backwards, you actually look demure.
Ma, get new glasses, all right?
Why must you always make such a big deal out of everything?
Who's making a big deal out of it?
I'm not making a big deal out of it.
Hi!
Hi, Barbara.
We got a call at the police station about lost glasses.
You got my message.
How many men you got on this?
Well, none really.
I did check, and nobody reported any lost glasses.
Not lost.
Stolen.
I want cops on this.
Big, burly, steroid-crazed cops.
Oh.
Sophia.
Oh, fine, get one for Blanche, too.
Throw it on my tab.
As long as I'm here, I should tell you there's been complaints from the neighbors about the noise at night.
Which neighbors?
Well, me.
Which noise?
Well, you.
Well, get earmuffs.
I pay my taxes.
Ah, Rose, another date with Karl tonight, huh?
You must really like this guy.
I do.
Karl is sweet, and he's supportive.
He understands that I still have feelings for Miles.
Rose, Miles is in the Witness Relocation Program.
You're not supposed to be telling people about him.
I didn't tell him Miles ratted on a gangster named The Cheeseman.
He just knows there's somebody I can't see anymore.
Oh, Karl is quite a guy.
Lately I've been dreaming about him at night, not Miles.
Although I do have one dream that both Karl and Miles are in.
Ohh.
And?
OK.
And Captain Kangaroo.
Oh, and look here, Dorothy.
This is my grandmother Marcelle Daboval.
Pure Southern, through and through.
Oh, Blanche, I'm sorry.
I just don't like the idea of this club.
It seems so discriminatory.
There is nothing wrong with being proud of what you are.
This club celebrates those individuals who can prove they come from 100% Southern Confederate stock.
And if you can't, then fiddle-di-doo to you.
Do you have any idea how much that hurts?
Ladies and gentlemen, Roy Orbison.
Ma, where did you get those glasses?
They're an old pair of Pop's, but at least they've got prescription lenses.
You can't possibly see through them.
Take them off before you hurt yourself.
No, they're great.
I see just fine.
Who's the black guy?
I'm about done with this side of the family tree.
I think you have the papers there from the Roquet marriage.
Yeah, wait a minute.
Oh, yeah, here.
Mm-hmm.
Walker Roquet married Rosalyn Roquet, 1861.
Rosalyn was fro- Uh-oh.
What?
I hate telling you this, Blanche No, that's not true.
I look forward to telling you this, Blanche.
The woman your great-grandfather married was born, well, outside of Georgia.
How far outside of Georgia?
Buffalo.
You're a Yankee, Blanche.
Well, no, this can't be.
A Yankee Doodle.
There must be some mistake.
You are that Yankee Doodle gal.
Let me see the certificate.
I want to see with my own eyes that my great-grandmother was that thing you said.
A Yankee.
Right.
A Yankee Doodle.
Oh, stop it.
Oh, my God.
Oh, did I mention her last name was Feldman?
Aw, no.
Oh, no, no, no.
No, it can't be.
I can't be Jewish.
I'll be damned.
The black guy is prejudiced.
This information will have no bearing on my getting into the "Daughters of the Old South.
" I'll just lie.
Oh, Blanche, this is ridiculous.
Why should you have to lie?
You're only one-eighth Yankee.
That's right.
I'm seven-eighths' Southern.
That's more than enough.
And if they don't let you in, instead of saying "fiddle-di-doo," well, you can always switch to Deedle didle deedle dum Thanks for a lovely evening, Karl.
Rose, I've got an idea.
What do you say we go away for the weekend?
Karl, I'm not sure I'm ready to.
It's because of this Miles guy, right?
I don't want to push you, but I just wish I knew what I was up against.
I mean, who is this guy?
What did he do?
Where is he now?
I wish I could tell you, but I really don't know anything about him anymore.
When I knew him, he was a professor at a college.
That's hard to believe.
It's one of the few places they have professors.
No.
Yeah.
No, I know that.
I meant I can't believe he left someone like you.
He left someone else like me?
No.
I mean you.
That he left you.
Oh.
OK.
I should be more clear.
That'd be great.
Listen, check with me later about the weekend.
I just want to be sure I'm ready, and that it's right.
I'll give you a ring.
I can't accept jewelry.
I mean, I'll call you soon.
I mean, I'll call you, Rose, soon and the phone will ring.
Oh, he really understands me.
Rose.
Rose, it's me.
Mi- Miles?
I beg your pardon.
I'm sure Blanche will be out any minute.
No, Rose, Rose, it's me.
Miles?
I've come back, Rose.
I had to see you.
But you've changed.
Well, I'm Amish, Rose.
That's my new identity in the Witness Protection Program.
See, I'm an Amish man.
I live on an Amish farm.
I carry wood, I dig holes and I milk things.
And to be frank it sucks.
I've missed you, Rose.
Oh, I've missed you, too, Miles.
No, no, Rose.
My name is now Samuel.
Samuel Plankmaker.
Isn't it dangerous for you to be here?
You might have been followed.
Oh, no, I took all kinds of precautions.
I even switched buggies on the way over.
Rose, of course, you can't tell a soul who I am.
Oh, don't worry.
Your secret is safe with me.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Boy, you find out you're a Jew with a dilemma, and these rabbis just come out of the woodwork.
Rose, who is this?
This is This is a friend.
His name is Samuel.
Samuel Plankmaker.
Samuel, these are my roommates.
Girls, you know Miles.
Samuel!
Shoot!
Sorry.
Well, I'm sorry, ladies.
It's me.
I was hoping to play a trick on you.
Silly Rabbi, tricks are for kids.
Look, ladies, I know it's a lot to ask, but I just had to see Rose.
I can't risk leaving, at least not tonight.
I need to stay here, if you'll let me.
Come on, Plankmaker.
I'll fix up a room for you.
Thank you.
I just want to go on record as saying I am against this.
That Cheeseman character could be following Miles, and there's no telling what he would do to me for information.
Blanche, you are really so self-centered.
In the first place, no gangster is going to come here.
And secondly, Blanche, this is important to Rose.
Aren't you interested in Rose's happiness?
Happiness?
I'm supposed to be happy?
Just when I was getting on with my life, Miles shows up, and for a visit.
He can't even stay.
How am I gonna move on?
How is my heart ever supposed to heal with Miles here?
Do you really think I'm self-centered?
Huh?
Come on, ya'll, hurry up.
Excuse me, folks.
I've gotta make a quick phone call.
Rose, would you mind getting me some punch?
He's gonna be late for the initiation ceremony.
Oh, take it easy, Feldman.
Hello, Billy Club?
It's me - Moran.
No, Moran The Cheeseman.
Look, I need some fake ID to get out of the country.
Yeah, I think my girlfriend's about to blab.
Well, thank you, Evelyn and Margaret, for that gripping and realistic reenactment of the defeat of General Burnside's troops at Fredericksburg.
It's hard to believe you couldn't get federal funding for this.
Mom says "hi".
I'm sorry, what?
Rose, what's going on with you?
You've been acting strange lately.
Seems like you're hiding something from me.
Oh, honey, I can't lie to you.
It's just not fair.
I have been hiding something from you.
I can't tell you where he's been, but Miles is back.
He's staying with me.
I understand, Rose.
And don't worry about your secret.
It won't go any further than me.
Now it's time to meet our new applicants and hear their lineage presentations.
So let us begin with Mrs. Louise Blakely.
Blanche, there is still time to back out.
Do you really think you can go up there and betray your heritage?
Dorothy, I belong in this club.
Why, I'm just as Southern as the fruit of a scuppernong arbor growing proudly by the lazy Mississippi.
Lawdy, Lawdy, are you full of it.
who married my Great Aunt Annalou Sellers, cousin to Claude Livaudais, who begat Elizabeth Blasingame.
Wait a minute.
Did you say Claude Livaudais?
Yes.
My great-grandfather told stories of Claude Livaudais.
He once sold horseshoes to a Union soldier.
Yankee.
No, no, I can explain.
Fie.
Traitor.
Oy vey.
Well, that was a close one.
We now call Blanche Devereaux.
Dorothy, I can't see a thing.
What's happening now?
The Harlem Globetrotters just took the court.
Hello, ladies.
I want to thank you for making time for me.
But I wonder if, instead of reading my family tree, if I couldn't just say a few words about what the South means to me.
Oh, no.
We need your family tree.
I see.
OK.
Well, I am Blanche Devereaux, nee Hollingsworth, of Atlanta, daughter of Curtis Hollingsworth and Samantha Roquet of Augusta and Shreveport, daughter of - I can't do it.
I Daughter of Feldman.
I'm a Feldman, damn it.
Of Buffalo.
Oh, ladies, now, please, I beg of you.
Let us put aside our ancient prejudices and change these rules.
Oh, ladies, let my people in.
No.
Next up, we have a lady actually I would like to say something else, if you don't mind.
Please let me in.
No!
Next up - That wasn't what I was going to say.
Yes, I am a Yankee, but hath not a Yankee eyes?
Hath not a Yankee hands?
If you prick us, do we not bleed?
If you tickle us, do we not laugh?
Sometimes all night.
I've heard her.
My point is, I am made up of many ingredients, but perhaps that is what gives me my uniquely American flavor.
Yes, for I am an American, and I'm leavin'.
I don't need your lousy club to make me feel special.
Oh, please?
No!
Oh, you lost the war.
Get over it.
Let's go.
Oh, honey, I hope you're not too upset about not fitting in with those dreadful people today.
Those small-minded peckerwoods aren't real Southerners.
I am a real Southerner.
Real Southerners are compassionate people.
They're wise and gentle, and they sit around on porch swings, regaling with stories of Abraham and Moses and all the other people who worked on the plantation.
Well, I sent Karl home.
Now I just have to talk to Miles.
Talk to Miles?
You seeing somebody else, Rose?
Ah, I can explain.
No, I understand.
Oh, Rose, of course, you're dating.
That's why I've come to a decision.
I'm going to Washington, talk to the Bureau.
I am leaving the Witness Protection Program.
I just know I need to be with you.
But the Cheeseman is looking for you.
Rose, don't worry.
So, hope I'm not interrupting anything.
Oh, my God!
You!
How did you find me?
Time to say goodbye, buddy boy.
Karl, Miles, as flattering as this is, I I don't want you fighting over me.
What?
Karl?
Is this the man you've been seeing?
Uh-huh.
But don't worry.
He's just a little jealous.
Got some bad news, Rose.
It's not you he's after.
He's using you to get to me.
This is the Cheeseman.
Oh!
My - I'll have to figure out what to do with you.
Wait a minute.
You can't come into this house waving that gun around.
Although it is a very nice one.
What is this, a Colt?
Oh, I knew all along it was a bad idea to let Miles stay here.
I'm too young to be struck down by a madman's bullet.
I've gotta find some way out of this.
I'll get it.
No one moves and no one makes a sound.
We all stand still until they leave.
Don't make a move, old lady.
Nice way to talk to your mother, Pussycat.
Who is it?
Put these on and find out.
My glasses.
Where did you find them?
I'm afraid Dreyfuss was the culprit.
He got them off the lanai.
You should really keep that gate closed.
Anybody could get in here.
It's great.
I can finally see again.
Hey, it's the Cheeseman.
Come on, get in here, both of ya.
Sophia, you recognize Karl as the Cheeseman?
You don't?
The man's been on America's Most Wanted at least six times.
The last episode was the highest rated ever.
Ever.
That must be a good feeling.
Well, it's kind of an acknowledgement.
I hate to interrupt you, but I have some bad news.
It's all over.
That's right, you're busted.
Barbara's a cop.
In a dress, without a gun.
So, basically, what you have here is a crossing-guard thing.
All right, all you gals are gonna get locked up in a closet, and us boys are going for a little walk.
Wow.
Were you ever activities director of a place called Shady Pines?
We got a lot of old business to discuss, mi amigo.
An awful lot.
Isn't there anything you can do, Barbara?
I suppose I could do this.
All right, Cheeseman, you're under arrest.
You told us you didn't have a gun.
You lied.
To a bad guy.
It's OK to lie to a bad guy.
You see that?
There's so many things we, as the public, don't understand.
I'm gonna take this creep out front and read him his rights.
Somebody call the station and tell 'em to get here, and I need handcuffs, right away.
Oh.
Oh, OK, you can borrow mine.
But please be careful with them.
They're a gift.
Ma, why don't we make that phone call from the kitchen?
Rose Rose, it's over.
I'm a free man.
I can be with you now, if that's still what you want.
Oh, that's all I've ever wanted.
But you have to promise me never to leave me again.
Well, sweetheart, I might have to for a little while.
Back on my farm in Pennsylvania, I still have an order in for 13 windmills.
Oh, screw 'em.
What are they gonna do, phone?
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend"  Blanche Devereaux's goin' on a diet.
Could you hold off until tomorrow?
I got some Sara Lee stock I'd like to unload.
Wait.
Can I have those gummy bears?
They are good, aren't they?
Oh, I don't eat 'em.
Then why do you want 'em?
To play army.
And sometimes I like to line 'em up around my bed and pretend I'm Gulliver.
Blanche, you put yourself through this hell every year.
Are you sure it's worth it?
Of course it's worth it.
On my anniversary, every year since I was married, I have slipped into my wedding dress and had my picture taken.
George was always so proud of me for stayin' svelte.
I'm gonna get into that dress this year even if it kills me.
It's not you I'm worried about.
The last time you went on a diet, you turned into that guy from Silence of the Lambs.
You did everything but butter my face.
It's gonna be different this time.
See, I'm on this drink-it-off diet.
"You have two shakes and a sensible meal every day, you lose weight the fast easy way".
I prefer the Italian diet.
You drink a bottle of wine, make a smart remark, then get your jaw wired.
Oh, Dorothy, a man called for you while you were out.
Finally.
Now we can break out that bottle of champagne we've been saving.
Ma.
Come on, Dorothy.
We might not get another chance.
Oh, sure we will.
We can just serve it at the wake.
He says he's in Miami on business and he wants to see you.
John Neretti called.
I haven't heard from him in almost 40 years.
Oh, I can't believe this.
Who's John Neretti?
He's a guy who humiliated me.
Could you narrow it down a bit, Dorothy?
He's the guy who stood me up for my senior prom.
Oh, Dorothy, I had no idea you were stood up for your prom.
Oh, that's awful.
I figured you didn't go, but to be stood up.
Oh, John Neretti was one of the toughest guys in my high school.
He smoked, he drank, he made those rude noises under his armpit.
I was totally in love with him.
And when he asked me to go to the senior prom, I was thrilled.
When I came down the stairs all dressed, Ma cried because her little girl was all grown up.
And she remarked that that night would always be the most memorable and important night that the two of us ever shared.
Remember, Ma?
Vaguely.
But John never showed up.
I've never forgotten it.
But apparently he has, or he wouldn't have had the nerve to call here.
You're not gonna call him back, are ya?
Oh, absolutely.
If John comes to Miami, I want to see him.
I don't think that's such a good idea, Pussycat.
Ma, don't you see?
When John Neretti gets here, I'm finally going to get my revenge.
He's going to see a beautiful vibrant woman who's done something with her life.
Well, Dorothy, I'd like to help, but - I can't go out with him on such short notice.
I meant "done something with her life standing up".
I'm talking about me.
Oh, my revenge will be to make John feel as bad as he made me feel.
I want him to see me, see my life, so he'll know exactly what he missed.
She doesn't know a whole lot about revenge, does she?
Well, I'm ready for John.
Oh, I've waited a long time for this night.
Dorothy, I'm begging you.
Don't go out with this guy.
He hurt you once, he'll hurt you again.
I am not going out with him.
But you said you were gonna make him suffer.
Don't you have to date a man to do that?
Not this time.
No, I have my plan all worked out, step by step.
First he'll comment on how stunning I look, and then I'll say, "Oh, John, did we have a date tonight?
Oh, I completely forgot".
And as he crumbles, I will show him the door.
What if he doesn't comment on how stunning you look?
Then you'll bring it up.
Time for my shake.
Honey, how you doin' with this diet?
Oh, no problem.
Piece of cake.
Nice big piece of chocolate cake.
Devil's food, smothered in whipped cream and coconut flakes.
And a lobster.
Blanche.
Ohh, I'm fine, I'm fine.
Ooh, a wonderful strawberry shake.
Strawberry.
Mmm.
I bet that'd go great with a burger.
Ma, you're being a little insensitive, aren't you?
A little.
Who wants an Ã©clair?
Oh, God, that's John.
Oh, I just hope I can be mean enough.
Dorothy, do that thing you do to me in the morning when I try to take a piece of bacon off your plate.
Blanche, I want to tell you something.
I've never weighed more than 100 pounds on any day of my adult life.
And because you're my friend, I want you to sit down, and I'll share with you that secret.
Tell me, Sophia.
I was born that way.
I could eat anything and never get fat.
Did anyone ever tell you you look like George Kirby?
No, no.
Wait, wait.
It's time that John Neretti learned a lesson.
That I am not that same little girl whose head can be turned by a pair of beautiful eyes and a killer smile.
Now.
Dorothy.
Dorothy, look at you.
You're as beautiful now as you were then.
How have you been?
I love you!
I, uh I'd love you to meet my friend Rose.
Oh.
Hi.
John Neretti.
Shall we go?
We've got reservations at 8:30.
Take me.
Out.
Take me out for dinner.
Sure.
Dorothy Ahem.
I thought you were gonna make him suffer.
Oh, and I will.
Tomorrow morning I'll tell him he's the worst lover I ever had.
Hope you like medieval food.
I love it.
Just glad I didn't have it for lunch.
Good evening, my lord.
Good evening, my lady.
I am Don.
I will be your fool for the entire evening.
Would you like to know about our specials?
We have pheasant and we have wild boar.
How is the pheasant?
You like chicken?
Yes.
It's chicken.
Why don't you bring us a couple of grogs while we think about it?
Diet grog if you have it.
Just sit right back and you'll hear a tale A tale of a fateful trip That started from this tropic port Aboard this tiny ship Gee, it's so strange sitting here with you.
I mean, you're so different.
Why?
Well, I remember you as that tough kid in a leather jacket.
Fights, vandalism.
You were really a juvenile delinquent.
But that's all behind you.
Tell me, what do you do now?
I manufacture spray paint.
At least all that training didn't go to waste.
If not for the courage of that fearless crew The Minnow would be lost The Minnow would be lost It's wonderful seeing you again.
I'd forgotten how charming, how vivacious, how - how lovely - Two knights and a rabbi walked into a bar.
And the first one said I would - You were saying?
Well, I was about to say I'm gonna be in town for a few more days.
Can we get together Friday night?
Oh, I can't on Friday.
The high school where I teach is having its senior prom that night.
I promised I'd chaperone.
Can you bring a date?
You can't be serious.
I'll buy you a corsage.
Make it orchids.
Just make sure you show up this time.
What do you mean?
You didn't show up at our last prom.
Not that I ever think of it.
What are you talking about?
I showed up.
What?
Yeah.
Your mother sent me away.
She what?
She said I was dressed like a bum and slammed the door in my face.
She what?
The millionaire and his wi-i-ife Something wrong?
Oh, no, no, not at all.
But I'll tell you, on the way out, I would like to stop at the gift shop.
I'm gonna be needing one of those spiked balls on a chain.
Hi, Ma.
Hi, Dorothy.
Bye, Dorothy.
Ma, come back.
I wanna sit and have a little talk.
Why?
Come on, now, would it hurt to spend a little time with your daughter?
That remains to be seen.
Rose, would you excuse us just for a minute?
Sure.
I know that tone of voice.
Somebody's gonna get it.
Ma, I'm going to ask you a question, and however you answer, I'll believe you.
Did you tell John Neretti to go away the night of my senior prom because you didn't like the way he was dressed?
Well Liar!
You knew John showed up that night, and you didn't tell me.
You didn't want me to go out with him tonight.
You knew he'd bring it up.
I can explain.
Just don't lock me away in another ill-equipped nursing home.
I promise nothing.
It's true.
I did send him away that night because he was dressed like a hood.
He started to mouth off to me, so I told him to leave and not to come back until he was wearing a decent jacket and a tie.
Why didn't you tell me?
I thought he'd come back, and when he didn't, well, I was afraid if you knew the truth, you'd never forgive me.
It's water under the bridge.
What's the big deal?
Stanley Zbornak, Ma.
That's the big deal.
When John didn't show up that night, I lost all my self-esteem.
And when Stan asked me out two weeks later, I said yes, because I didn't think I could do any better.
That's why I went to that drive-in movie with Stan, and that's why I got pregnant.
And that's why I got married.
Are you saying if it wasn't for me, you would have married John Neretti?
I don't know.
Maybe.
Or maybe I would have met somebody else, somebody wonderful.
But I'll never know because of you.
You took away my choices.
How can I ever forgive you for that?
Time for today's sensible meal.
Where's my tuna quiche?
You heard me.
I said, where's my tuna quiche?
I get 5 ounces of solid food a day, and I want my tuna quiche.
You mean that little pie?
Little pie?
Little pie?
I wanted a snack.
A snack?
!
I thought it was a little fishy.
Oh, you ate my sensible meal.
You ate my sensible meal!
Blanche, stop.
Blanche!
You're out of control.
Oh, my God.
Oh, Rose, honey, I'm sorry.
What did I just do?
This.
Honey, we know dieting is hard.
We've all been there.
I remember the time Stan and I went on that weight-loss- through-sex diet.
The idea being every time you felt hungry, you would substitute food with some sexual activity.
Did it work?
I gained 18 pounds.
Well, fine.
I won't have my sensible meal.
Tomorrow's my anniversary anyway.
I'll just have my last shake tonight.
Where's my shake?
You heard me.
I said, where's my shake?
I needed something to wash down the little pie.
Aah!
It was so fishy.
I don't believe you.
Well, if it's any consolation, I'm still hungry.
Oh, shut up!
Just shut up, you babblin', bubble-headed, bleach-blond Baboon.
baboon!
She needed a "B".
John.
Ooh.
I'll go get Dorothy.
Won't you have a seat?
Mrs. Petrillo.
It's John Neretti.
Well, you haven't aged a bit.
I said, you haven't aged a bit.
I hear you.
I'm not deaf.
"Haven't staged a hit"?
Oh, John, I'm sorry I kept you waiting.
Dorothy.
You remember my lying vicious toad of a mother.
Is there a problem?
Oh, not at all.
Happy as ever at Happiness House.
Aww.
Well, I guess we should be going.
Oh, not before I get a picture.
Oh, Rose.
Oh, come on, Dorothy, it's your prom picture.
Say "cheese".
Cheese.
Now smile.
We'll save a lot of time if you just do it.
Have a good time.
Thank you.
I never got to go to the junior prom in St. Olaf.
How come?
It was just for people named "Junior".
It fits.
My wedding dress fits.
Congratulations.
You weren't married in a white dress?
Oh, Rose, come on.
It's one thing to hear snickering when you walk down the aisle, but me in white?
Even I couldn't keep a straight face.
OK, Rose, come on, take the picture.
I gotta hand it to you, Blanche.
I never thought you'd fit into that thing.
Well, all the pain and torture were worth it.
George would be so proud of me.
My body's just as lithe and taut as the day we were wed.
Blanche Nothing.
It was an enchanting evening.
"Enchanted Evening".
That was the theme of that prom that we never got to.
Little more romantic than the theme they had tonight.
"Wear A Condom" is more than a prom theme.
It's sort of become the school slogan.
It's catchy.
Oh, I wish Stan had gone to that high school.
You know, I I've got a little confession to make.
One of the reasons I wanted to see you again was to, well, show you how well I turned out.
Well, I wanted to show you how well I turned out.
I mean, I was a mess in high school.
We all were.
Yeah.
Except for what was her name?
Roseanne De Rasmo.
Oh, she had it all together.
I wonder whatever happened to her.
She turned into a bitter lonely lady.
Came into a lot of money.
At least, that's how she was after our divorce.
I had a wonderful time tonight.
So did I. I'm just sorry I messed up in high school.
It wasn't your fault.
That was my mother's.
Actually, I've always wanted to thank your mother for that night.
Why?
For not letting me take you out.
She took one look at my clothes and my attitude.
She said it wasn't good enough for her daughter.
Her little girl deserved better.
She actually said that?
Yeah.
And a whole lot of Italian words.
I'm not too sure if it was a curse, but I did talk like a girl for about three weeks.
It was a turning point in my life.
That's when I finally started growing up.
And all that happened because of my mother?
I like to think so.
Tell you another thing I remember about that night.
How nervous I was.
Nervous?
About what?
Our good-night kiss.
I was terrified.
I figured, "Oh, she's not gonna want me to kiss her good night.
She'll -" It was worth waiting for.
Can I call you next time I get back to town?
I'd like that.
Good night.
Don't take me, Death.
Don't take me.
Oh, it's you.
Ma, you OK?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Oh, Ma, I said some terrible things to you, and I'm sorry.
I'm responsible for all the decisions I made in my life, and if my life didn't turn out perfectly, well whose has?
Mary Ann Mobley comes to mind.
She gets to sleep with Gary Collins every night.
Every night.
No, what I'm trying to say is we all make the best decisions we can make with what we know.
Exactly.
Just like it was on the night of your prom.
I did what I thought was best.
I was wrong.
I'm sorry, but you were my first.
You didn't come with a book of instructions.
Anyway, all I ever wanted was the best for my little girl.
Because you deserved it.
I didn't want you to settle for less.
You still think of me as your little girl?
Of course I do.
In fact, come on.
Sit on my lap for old times' sake.
Oh, come on, Ma.
You can't be serious.
I mean, I'm a grown woman.
What's wrong with a mother wanting to hold her child?
Dorothy, do this for me.
Sit on my lap.
Well, if you're sure.
I Oh, Ma.
Oh, this brings back so many memories.
The time I was five Bad idea!
Bad idea!
Ma, you all right?
I'm fine.
I just panicked for a minute.
Come, sit down here.
Oh, Ma.
This is just like old times.
So tell me, did you have a good time tonight at your prom, Pussycat?
Wonderful, Ma.
It was everything I wanted it to be.
Come, tell Ma all about it.
Well John bought me this beautiful corsage.
And then, when we got to the gymnasium, it was so beautiful.
Anyway, when we got there, we walked in
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend"  I'm not happy with my zabagliones.
Maybe you just need a push-up bra.
Blanche, zabaglione is a traditional Italian dessert.
It's my Uncle Angelo's favorite.
Yeah, my brother.
He's quite the scungiscoror-or-or.
Even I don't know that one.
That wasn't a word.
My dentures slipped.
Ma, Uncle Angelo's plane lands at 4:00.
You have plenty of time to make a fresh batch before then.
Good, because these aren't fit for human consumption.
Top of the morning, sunshines.
Hey, Rose, try one of these.
Oh, no thanks.
I'm doing what we all should be doing - dieting for the bachelorette auction next Saturday.
Not all of us.
I told you, Rose, count me out.
Even if it is for charity, I am not gonna stand up there and allow myself to be sold to the highest bidder like some Holstein cow at a livestock auction.
Dorothy, livestock don't get chauffeur-driven limousine rides to fancy four-star restaurants and the symphony afterwards.
Except during St. Olaf Bicentennial Day.
Rose, I am not going.
It is degrading.
Don't be a stick-in-the-mud.
It's for the Children's Hospital.
If you can't degrade yourself for a bunch of sick kids, who can you degrade yourself for?
Listen to this.
Eleanor Roosevelt in a garter belt.
Now, you can't tell us that a part of you isn't at least a little excited.
Remember last year's auction?
That rush of euphoria when the auctioneer calls out "Sold"!
and you fall into the arms of your valiant Galahad?
My Galahad was a balloon salesman named Sid.
Well, hey, who knew that sawed-off little gnome would outbid a Navy admiral?
And a fire chief.
And that jeweler who was a dead ringer for Mr. Richard Widmark.
That was a year ago.
How do you remember all this?
I tagged 'em for migratory purposes.
Dorothy, come on.
The auction needs you.
The children need you.
Please, won't you reconsider?
Oh, all right!
It's only one night.
I'll go, but I'll tell you, I really hate this.
Oh, come on, Dorothy, that balloon man couldn't have been that terrible.
I got the feeling I was the man's first date that wasn't inflatable.
Hey, I have an idea.
Dorothy just did something really nice for us.
Why don't we do something nice for her?
Why don't we buy her a man?
Well, I'm in, and I know just the person.
Free every Saturday night Oh, wait, that's a woman.
Oh, wait, that's Dorothy.
No, I meant for the auction, so she won't get stuck with another loser.
Rose, that's not a bad idea.
We were all gonna donate money anyway.
We could chip in, say, 50 bucks and buy her the bull of the ball.
Oh, but who do we know who knows a man?
Blanche, you know hundreds of men.
I know.
I just like to hear you say it.
Hiya, sweetie pie.
How ya doin'?
Fine, cupcake.
Thanks for asking.
Dorothy, I know you're in there.
You always could slam a door.
That's one of the things I love about you.
You flatter me.
Wait, wait.
Dorothy, I have to talk to you.
This wouldn't happen to be an apology for ruining our wedding, would it?
No, just something I thought I should tell you in person.
Remember my Uncle Morris?
Dorothy, he died.
Boy, you smell good.
Get away from me.
No, no, no.
You don't understand.
Something wonderful has happened.
In his will, Uncle Morris left us an apartment building - jointly.
We're partners.
Don't you see, Dorothy?
We'll be together, and we'll have a place of our own.
Oh, God, he's proposing to her again.
Will one of you raise your standards, please?
!
Sophia, I'm not proposing.
I'm here because Dorothy and I just inherited an apartment building.
We're gonna be landlords together.
It's not a very big building, but she'll still clear a couple hundred bucks a month.
Dorothy, this is wonderful.
With that kind of money, we can hire a really good-lookin' gardener.
Dorothy, it really does sound like a great opportunity.
On Stan's behalf, Charlie once made a lot of money in business with a partner who was also a lousy, no-good, underhanded, backstabbing worm.
Let me guess, Rose.
Ivan Boesky-Vanderfloovenhooven- meistergarbengerbenfleckman.
That's the louse.
So, um, what do you say, babe?
Partners?
Goodbye, Stan.
OK.
I get the message.
I guess I'm just not a person you want in your life.
Am I?
Goodbye, Stan.
Can you believe this guy?
Like I would think for a minute about being in business with him.
Nonsense, Dorothy.
You can't pass up a chance to own real estate.
It's been a lifesaver for me.
You get a bunch of saps to pay your mortgage for you every month while your equity just rises higher and higher, while those poor suckers - What I meant was it's a great opportunity to make new friends.
Look who's here.
Ah, buon giorno, Rosa.
Ah, Blanche.
Oh, my goodness.
I haven't been hugged so much since V-E Day.
Which was kinda tricky, because as you know, we lost.
Angelo, you're even handsomer than you were your last visit.
Thank you.
I been plucking, eh?
See?
I got two eyebrows now.
Everybody loves 'em.
You sit right down here, Angelo.
I got a surprise for you - zabaglione.
Your favorite.
Ah.
Mmm.
Sophia.
And that's the new batch.
I'm sorry.
I cannot pretend no more.
Uncle Angelo, what's wrong?
It's a long sad story, a story of love, a story of deception, a story of a fool.
You know the story of Elsie Holdenfelder?
Absolutely, Rose.
That one's even more popular in Europe than it is here.
I met a beautiful young Sicilian aerobics instructor.
Gorgeous eyes, angelic mouth and a behind that must have been made on a Saturday because even the good Lord himself would want to take a day off to admire it.
I lost my heart and I opened my wallet, eh?
Oh dear, the expensive gifts and fancy dinners and weekends in Mykonos, eh?
I even wore one of those, uh, tiny Speedo swimsuits, shows all your gingerbread and everything.
And she leaves me.
What does a 6'7" American basketball player got that I don't?
Well, Angelo, speaking in terms of the gingerbread alone Blanche!
Go ahead, Uncle Angelo.
Anyway, I spend so much money on this girl, I forget about my business.
The bank foreclosed, leaving me flat broke.
I got no savings, no place to live.
And I gotta tell you, a lot of women find this a negative.
It's a family curse, this obsession with women.
The men in our family are weak.
Why couldn't they all be more like Cousin Antony?
Ma, Cousin Antony had an obsession with men in cowboy hats who hung around Times Square.
What am I gonna do?
You're gonna trust in your family, because family is there when you're down, and family stops at nothing!
- nothing to help one of their own.
Blanche, I want my brother Angelo to come here and live with us.
Oh, I'm sorry, Sophia.
There's just no room.
Hey, I tried.
Wait a minute, Dorothy.
You're a landlord now.
Maybe there's a vacancy in your new building.
Don't call it my building.
I don't even know if I'm gonna hang on to it yet.
I I I understand.
Sophia, any mail I get, just address it "Guy in the Gutter, Post Office Box Anywhere".
All right.
All right, all right, Uncle Angelo.
For the time being, I guess you can use Uncle Morris' old apartment.
Oh, Dorothy, thank you so much.
My first apartment in America.
Here I will begin again.
Here I will start a new life.
Dorothy, my new life - how close I'm gonna start it to the beach?
Going once.
Going twice You still want to tell me this isn't degrading?
Don't be ridiculous.
It's for charity.
Sold!
For $4.
Well, it's degrading if you don't hit double figures.
I really appreciate your bidding on Dorothy.
It's for a good cause.
You'll be rewarded.
Not in this lifetime "Variety is the watchword for our next bachelorette" Dorothy Zbornak.
Come on up, Dorothy.
This is perfect.
The way the bidding's going, we won't be out more than $20, $30 apiece.
"If Dorothy's not off winging her way to Molokai "to assist Father Damian in his work with the lepers, you can find her hang-gliding high above the Florida Keys".
Rose, where did you get that?
From your mother.
Before she and I talked, I wasn't aware of any of it.
"She's a scratch golfer who, under President Jimmy Carter, "served as the United States Senate Majority Whip.
And she likes to read".
I figured, close with the truth.
It'll kind of anchor the rest.
I want to thank you all for holding this event on a night when my hang glider is in the shop and, uh, Congress is in recess and the lepers are on Geraldo.
Go ahead, Rose.
Right, Dorothy.
All right.
Now, let's start the bidding at $5.
$5.
$100.
Stanley, what are you doing here?
I'm buying a date with the woman I love.
Oh, jeez.
Not in front of people.
What the hell is he doing?
Didn't you give him a limit?
this man removed.
He's a lonely male impersonator.
What?
!
What is wrong with you?
The woman's been with lepers.
Stanley, stop it.
I am not going out with you.
I would rather be bound and gagged and left on an anthill covered with honey.
Sold.
Dorothy, I say that.
Sold!
She says that.
Rose, do something.
Sold!
Sorry, Dorothy.
That's $500 for the Children's Hospital.
I guess dreams really can come true.
Dorothy, here's something that'll get your mind off Stan.
According to my calculations, allowing for overhead, tonight brought in a grand total of $50.
No, $500.
5,000.
It's 5,000, Rose.
Decimal points don't have six legs.
More than 10% of it thanks to Dorothy here.
Oh, who's keeping score?
What's important is that we made a lot of money.
Together we made a consid- They were fighting over me.
Did you see it?
Well, Dorothy, to be fair, one of 'em was Stan.
Do I sense a tinge of envy there, Miss "going, going, gone" for 25.50?
You can't put a price tag on beauty, Dorothy.
Oh, sure you can - 25.50.
Oh, I'm sorry, Blanche.
No, I'm not blaming any of this on you.
It's all my fault for giving Stan so many chances.
But I can't do this again.
I mean, how many times can I make the same mistake?
How many times can you bang your head against the wall before it starts to bleed?
Nine.
Believe me, Dorothy, I know what you're going through.
I once had a relationship with a man I couldn't get rid of.
Every time I turned around, there he was, pathetically underfoot.
Long after I outgrew my need for him, he was there with flowers and candy, perfume.
I couldn't move without him following me like a puppy dog.
How'd you finally get rid of him?
Monday came, and we both had to go back to work.
Thank you, Blanche.
And thank you too, Rose.
What did I say?
Nothing.
And I can't tell you how much I appreciate it.
Ah, Dorothy, I want to talk to you about my apartment.
Ah, I'm grateful.
I love where I live.
And the last thing I want to do is come to you with every little problem.
And now your mother would like to talk to you.
Dorothy, you're making my brother live like a peasant.
He has no closet space.
Uncle Angelo, you moved in with one suitcase.
What do you need with more closets?
I don't like to talk about my brother's personal life, but a man brings a woman home, how is he supposed to play a decent game of hide and-go-seek?
Under the table, behind the couch Bambi was on to me like that.
And then there's the water pressure.
I got more water pressure than this apartment.
And another thing - W-Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Why is any of this your business?
He's my brother.
Well, I'm your daughter.
Dorothy, I've known you, what, 60 years?
Angelo I've known 85.
To tell you the truth, I don't quite trust you yet.
Uncle Angelo, in the past three days you have complained about everything in the apartment except the rent.
Reason being you don't pay any.
I told you she'd throw it in our face.
And speaking of complaints, what about that out-of control housewarming party that kept all the other tenants awake until dawn?
The one I was not invited to?
That wasn't a party.
That was a quiet dinner for two.
Hi there, Angelo.
Well, Rose and I are ready for our date.
I just think it's so sweet the way the mariachi band all chipped in to go on a double date with Rose and me.
Here they are now.
Angelo, great party the other night.
Yeah, you look great in a tux.
It wasn't your kind of crowd, Pussycat.
That's funny.
It's the same excuse you used when you didn't invite me to my Sweet 16.
Now, that was a party.
Hi, it's me Stan - from the fund-raiser?
I remember.
Come on in.
Uncle Angelo, Ma, I hope you don't mind.
Stan and I are going to go into the kitchen and talk.
Hey, great party the other night, Angelo.
Stanley, I appreciate you coming here tonight, but I've decided I'm not going out with you.
But I won the bidding at the auction.
I understand that.
But there's nothing you can say to make me change my mind.
You owe me $500.
How about Thai food?
That sounds great.
Wait, wait, wait.
I said I'm not going to go, and I am not going to go.
It's just that, well, you have different intentions than I do.
It's not my intentions, it's God's intentions.
D-Do you think this is all a coincidence?
I mean, look - your uncle visits, my uncle dies.
Your uncle needs a place to live, my uncle gives us a building.
Don't you see?
God wants us to be together, babe.
It's almost Biblical.
And thus he smote your Uncle Morris, huh?
There's a whole school of thought that says he's a wrathful God.
Yeah, well that would explain your hair.
Stanley, pay attention.
No date tonight.
OK, I guess I'll just have to go through my life without you in it.
Stanley, I am in it.
We're business partners.
That's the extent of it.
You understand?
OK.
OK, I give up.
Business partners.
I understand.
Can we shake on it?
I need you, Dorothy!
I want you!
Without you, I'm nothing.
Do you hear me?
Nothing.
Stan, as much of a turn on as this is, get off the floor.
I belong on the floor if I've driven you out of my life.
From this moment on, the floor is my home.
Enjoy.
Dorothy!
I can explain, Ma No need to, Pussycat.
Let's move quick before the cops get here.
You wipe for fingerprints, I'll get a shovel and a Hefty bag.
Sophia.
Oh, great.
It figures you couldn't finish the job.
I'm gonna go get the toaster.
Ow!
Ow!
Sophia, I'm not dead.
Not yet.
Would you slow down?
I'm an old woman!
Stan, I want no part of any of this.
I am out.
I am selling my half of the building.
Fine.
I'm glad.
I'll tear the dump down and turn it into office space for Zbornak, Incorporated.
Fine.
Fine!
Don't blame me that it means throwing your uncle out on the street.
Stan, that's blackmail.
But it's got a certain logic.
So, business partners?
I have no choice.
Business partners.
And dinner?
Absolutely not.
Stanley, you claim that you have changed.
Well, so have I. Stan, I have finally come to realize that no matter how hard you try, you cannot fix something that no longer works.
I've learned to let go, Stanley.
Dorothy And you should, too.
I don't know if I can do it.
If that guy at the auction had bid $6 million for you, I don't care what I would have had to do, I would have come up with six million and one.
You're my girl, Dorothy.
You always will be.
But if you want me to go, then that's what I'll do.
You know, Pussycat - I can't believe it.
He's not coming back.
You OK?
Yeah, I think I'm OK.
No, no, I know I'm OK.
You know, Ma, for the first time, I feel that it's over, that it's really over.
Dorothy, forgive me, but I gotta speak.
Sometimes it's harder to close the door than to open a window.
Oh, that's very wise, Uncle Angelo.
Thank you.
Actually, I was talking about the apartment, but I'll take wise.
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Hi, girls.
Oh, Rose, I missed you at breakfast.
Did you and Miles have fun last night?
Oh, yes.
We had dinner at the Mandarin Rathskeller, that new Chinese-German restaurant.
How was it?
Oh, the food was good.
But an hour later, Miles and I were both hungry.
For power.
Oh, my, that provincial Midwestern sense of humor that everybody hates.
Yes?
Hello.
I'm Detective Parres, Dade County P.D. Does a Sophia Petrillo reside here?
This is my mother.
Is there a problem?
I'd just like to ask a few questions.
I've got nothing to hide, copper.
Or do you prefer "flatfoot" or "gumshoe"?
Before my mother lost it completely, she watched a lot of James Cagney.
They colorized him.
Can you believe it?
Let the man rest.
He's got hair the color of Rose's and more rouge than Blanche.
Whatever you think she did, she's guilty.
I saw her.
Please sit down.
Mrs. Petrillo, where were you on the night of September 4th, 1985?
Did you see Awakenings?
Throw a ball at me.
How the hell should I know?
I don't even remember what color underwear I'm wearing.
Ma, the beginning of September.
That's when Shady Pines burned down and you came here to live with us.
Oh, yeah.
I'm not wearing underpants.
Mrs. Petrillo, were you acquainted with the late Maria Heartgrove?
She died?
Good riddance.
God rest her soul.
We have a deathbed confession from her stating that the two of you started the Shady Pines fire.
Why, that's ridiculous.
What did you do?
She claimed that on the night of the fire, the two of you were in your room cooking s'mores.
Nonsense.
I don't even know what s'mores are.
You remember, Sophia.
They're those little toasted graham cracker and chocolate sandwiches.
Marshmallow.
Don't forget the marshmallow.
Whoops.
In her deposition, Mrs. Heartgrove said that you were in possession of an illegal hot plate, and while you were cooking, the curtains caught on fire.
Then you panicked and fled, and the fire continued unchecked.
Now wait just a minute.
This is crazy.
Do you have any proof?
Did anybody find that alleged hot plate?
Presumably it was lost in the fire.
Maria was just out to get me.
She was always jealous because I still had my own hair.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Petrillo.
I have no choice but to bring you in on a charge of negligent arson.
My mother is 85 years old.
Surely you - I'm sorry.
The law recognizes no age limits.
Mrs. Petrillo, you're under arrest.
Well, all's well that ends well.
What?
It's a title of a Shakespeare play.
Rose, nothing is well, and nothing has ended.
Sophia's out on bail, awaiting her trial.
Well, if Dorothy had said it, you'd think it was brilliant.
So this is life on the outside.
It's changed.
You've all gotten so old.
Ma, knock it off.
You were gone an hour.
If anyone's upset, it should be me.
I had to dig up the bail money.
Please.
How do you put a price tag on getting your mother back?
What was it, $500?
Wow.
I better improve my attitude around here.
Well, Herb, here you are.
Hi.
Hi.
Girls, this is Herb Shrewsbury, our lawyer.
So, what are my chances, shyster?
Or do you prefer "ambulance chaser"?
Ma, he's here to help you.
Are you nuts?
If it helps.
Well, the trial is set for a month from now, so I'm going to need some character witnesses.
Maybe you should start by interviewing me.
I would make a wonderful witness.
I can't tell you how many times I've been badgered by lawyers.
Well, I could, but it might sound like boasting.
Oh, the stories I could tell you about me.
You're not gonna believe this, but I I shall become a great Southern writer, carrying on the tradition of the other great Southern writers like uh all those that are so famous they need not be mentioned.
Oh, girls, it's gonna be so exciting.
I am gonna make a fortune.
And I won't even have to use my imagination.
My life is a romance novel.
Your life is a sports page.
Listen.
Tell me I can't do better than this in my sleep.
"He grabbed her.
"She could feel his fingers pressing into her moist flesh.
"Her heart was pounding, her loins on fire as he spun her around, her dress ripping open" You know how many times I've experienced that?
Your loins have been on fire?
Yes.
"She melted into his -" Where exactly are your loins?
Rose, it doesn't matter.
Just listen.
"She melted into his arms, faint now with the animal musk of him" I didn't know people had loins.
I've heard of loin of pork, but In her case, the same thing.
Isn't this exciting - taking part in a protest?
Standing up as free Americans and exercising our right to say, "We're mad as hell and we're not gonna take it anymore".
I'm out of spit.
Can I go now?
and you're ready to quit?
We joined the Friends of Sea Mammals for a reason.
You are so unmotivated.
Well, when I joined this Mammals With Blowholes thing I didn't expect to be carrying picket signs on some grungy dock.
I was hoping more for a fund-raiser cocktail party with Chinese lanterns and Portuguese - no, Hispanic waiters in tight black pants.
And we hire a band to play fish songs in pirate suits with muscles bulging.
Your mouth is watering now, Blanche.
Keep licking.
Herb, I'm aware of how important it is to make a good impression in court.
Tell me, what do you think would move the jury more - cleavage or a lot of leg?
That depends on what you're going for - a chuckle or a guffaw.
Blanche, I think a conservative ensemble is in Sophia's best interest.
Oh, there'll be music?
Ma, where you going?
If he puts you three on the stand, up the river.
Ma, what are you doing up?
I can't sleep.
I keep trying to think back on that night at Shady Pines.
And?
And we're out of toilet paper.
I told you, Dorothy, I can't remember a thing.
Just because your memory is fuzzy doesn't mean that you're guilty.
Doesn't mean I'm innocent, either.
Ma!
Let's face it.
I've done some pretty peculiar things in my day.
Of course, I've got an excuse.
I'm an old lady.
I left my mind in the '60s.
Dorothy, have you seen my teeth?
They're in your mouth, Ma.
I know that.
Don't they look good today?
I ran them through the dishwasher.
Ma, listen to me.
You got Martha Raye and Madge mixed up again.
Morning, Blanche.
Morning, Ma.
You sleep well?
No.
I had that recurring nightmare, the one where I'm in bed with Warren Beatty and he says, "Sorry, this is too sick, even for me".
Well, now I know why Hemingway killed himself.
Oh, girls, I have writer's block.
It is the worst feeling in the world.
Try ten days without a bowel movement sometime.
You just sit there, hour after hour after hour.
Tell me about it.
Frisk me.
Oh, Ma, stop that.
What are you doing?
Just frisk me.
Frisk me.
It's important practice for me if I'm going to prison.
Ma, you are not going to prison.
Now think back.
Shady Pines.
What was the last thing that you remember before that fire?
Meat loaf.
Nine days in a row.
Their only witness is dead.
That ought to work in our favor.
Dorothy, that hot plate was mine.
I made s'mores all the time.
I hated Shady Pines.
I can't remember, but I know I did it.
I must have.
I'm goin' to prison.
Ma won't come out of her room.
She's miserable.
Just to keep me up to speed, Dorothy - it's this negligent arson rap and the prospect of spending the rest of her waning years in jail thing, right?
No, it's the "Rose in the kitchen" thing.
I just hate to see Sophia so unhappy.
I wish there was something we could do to make her feel better.
I mean, we're always there when we need each other.
You know, if I have a problem, Rose is there for me, and if Dorothy has a problem, I'm there for her.
I wish I knew what to do.
All right.
All right.
I can pick up a cue.
Picture it.
Sicily, 1912.
A beautiful young peasant girl with clear olive skin meets an exciting but penniless Spanish artist.
There's an instant attraction.
They laugh, they sing, they slam down a few boilermakers.
Shortly afterwards, he's arrested for showing her how he can hold his palette without using his hands.
But I digress.
He paints her portrait, and they make passionate love.
She spends much of the next day in the shower with a loofah sponge scrubbing his fingerprints off her body.
She sees the portrait and is insulted - it looks nothing like her - and she storms out of his life forever.
That peasant girl was me and that painter was Pablo Picasso.
Ma, I have a feeling you're lying.
Be positive, Dorothy.
OK, I'm positive you're lying.
This is terrible.
Trick move from your checkers-by-mail partner?
No, it's from the company Charlie worked for.
They've gone bankrupt and so has their pension fund.
I'm not gonna be getting pension checks anymore.
I can't afford to live without that pension.
Let's not panic.
I'm sure they can't just cut you off.
She's right.
There has to be a good explanation.
You'll call them tomorrow.
Everything will be fine.
What if it's not?
What if I can't pay my own way?
What if I can't afford food?
What if I have to sleep outside in some park?
There's an old Italian saying for times like this.
Scappa.
Tu si mal fortuna.
What does that mean?
Get away from me.
You're bad luck.
OK, that's it.
Drink this.
It's a secret potion from the old country guaranteed to put you to sleep.
Looks like milk.
Trust me, Rose.
Drink it.
Slowly.
That's right, down the hatch.
We call this Sicilian Sominex.
Now, you might feel a slight tingling, but believe me, you'll sleep like a baby.
I don't feel any tingling.
When's it gonna hit me?
Sophia!
Oh, I just had a terrible thought.
What if, in some weird way, all this was true and Ma went to jail?
Oh, my God.
This is very important, Rose.
It might take a couple of hours, so relax and get comfortable.
The last time someone said that to me, I had two pigs on my back and I was pushing a wheelbarrow.
Why?
To relax and get comfortable.
OK, now, where should I begin?
Let's see.
I think the one thing you need to know is that I'm the one around here with the level head, the real voice of reason.
I haven't been this scared since 1952 when St. Olaf's most active volcano threatened to erupt.
Luckily there were some Druid priests who were in town for the opening of Stonehengeland.
They said they could stop it if they could sacrifice the town's dumbest virgin.
I don't know why I raised my hand.
It must have just been the excitement of the moment.
But they said the only way to prevent the eruption was for me to crawl through their legs up the volcano while they gave me my birthday whacks.
Well - and you're not gonna believe this - it turns out they weren't Druid priests at all, just a bunch of Shriners looking for a good time.
All creatures must learn to coexist.
Back where I come from, they do.
That's why the brown bear and the field mouse can share their lives and live in harmony.
'Course, they can't mate or the mice would explode.
You want me to drive tonight, Dorothy?
Oh, Rose, listen.
I'm not going to the meeting tonight.
Oh?
How come?
I'm not comfortable there.
I'm not comfortable with the people, with the whole thing.
But you need the group support, Dorothy.
It's not a good idea to go it alone.
Did I ever tell you about my cousin Vigdov Frickin?
He tried to go it alone in a three-legged race.
Well, you know what happened to him?
Please.
Please, Rose!
I don't want to hear about your Frickin cousin.
That was very interesting, Rose, but now that I've heard you, I think I'll probably just plead insanity.
You look perfectly sane to me.
High praise indeed.
Pussycat, when I go to trial, will you be a character witness for me, tell them I'm sweet and cute and don't have it in me to harm a fly?
What, you want me to perjure myself?
Basically.
Ma, don't worry.
Everything's gonna be fine.
Thank you for trying to cheer me up, Pussycat.
You're always there for me.
I appreciate that.
We're there for each other.
I don't know of any other mothers and daughters who have gone through half of what we've gone through.
I can't tell you how much it meant to me when you and I Two-and-a-half hours.
I thought you died.
What's wrong with you?
Nothing.
Who are you?
I'm the doctor.
We'll see about that.
Look, Mrs Petrillo.
I'm Dorothy's mother.
I wanna know what's wrong with her.
Don't tell me "nothing," because I know there's something wrong with her.
Mothers know.
Look, Ma, I'll talk to you about it later.
Your daughter is fine, Mrs. Petrillo.
Tip-top?
Tip-top.
Then, Mr. 100% Tip-top, why the hell does she feel like hell?
Look, Ma Wait.
I gotta hear this.
It could be functional.
Functional?
Mental.
Mental.
Well, let me tell you something, Mr. 100% Tip-top Mental, my daughter may be no spring chicken and her jaw might crack when she chews and she may have noticeable trouble digesting raw vegetables, but one thing she's not is mental.
Thanks, Ma.
OK, girls, I'm ready.
Well, Rose, do I look like the mayor of Palm Springs?
Doug Henning is the mayor of Palm Springs?
Just play the music, Rose.
They say we're young and we don't know We won't find out until we grow I don't know if all that's true But you got me and, baby, I got you Babe I got you, babe I got you, babe You know, Ma, I guess we do have a good relationship.
It's always been good.
I know we never did some of those mother/daughter things - baking cookies, dressing alike, braiding each other's hair.
Yeah, but wasn't it great making fun of those who did?
It sure was.
But come on, Ma.
The truth is, we have done our share of fighting.
Of course we fight.
We're Italian.
We like to fight.
It's our way of showing love.
Though I don't know if there was a lot of love that time that we Hi, Ma.
Gimme your watch.
Sure.
What do you want it for?
I'm working on a magic act for the talent show at the center.
Abracadabra, 1, 2, 3.
Ma!
Relax.
Dorothy, was your card the ace of spades?
Ma, what the hell are you talking about?
I think I got chapters seven and nine mixed up.
Ohh.
This watch is broken.
Ma, Stan gave me that watch when we got married.
The marriage never worked.
Why should the watch?
I waited up for you until two in the morning, and you still weren't home.
Oh, yeah.
Gertie and I and some of the girls went to Wolfie's to pick up guys.
I called Wolfie's at 11.
You weren't there.
Guess who got lucky.
Oh, God!
What can I tell you?
A couple of egg creams, the bright fluorescent lights and a retired jeweler named Shlomo all conspired to make a night of enchantment.
Not for me.
I can't tell you some of the horrible thoughts I had about what might have happened to you.
Although none as horrible as what you just described.
Ah, there you are.
Ma, I scheduled the appointment for your checkup.
Ma, you know you have to have a physical.
What do you want me to do - take you to court, have you declared incompetent?
I'm not incompetent.
Once when I laughed too hard, I had a little accident.
I guess we do have a strange way of showing our affection.
Oh, Ma, I'm glad to see you've cheered up, but why are you walking down memory lane all of a sudden?
It's just that I may not see you for a while.
Ma, they can't prove that you started that fire at Shady Pines, and you are not going to jail.
You can't be sure of that, Pussycat, so I'm doing what I have to do.
I'm jumping bail and moving back to Sicily.
Oh, hi, Ma.
How was your nap?
Nap?
I didn't take a nap.
I'm a nervous wreck.
How could I sleep a wink with this prison thing hanging over my head?
Let's grab lunch.
Ma, it's dinnertime.
Oh, I guess I did take a nap.
Ma, I don't know why you're nervous.
You are not going to prison.
I feel like I am in prison, with you keeping an eye on me 24 hours a day.
Are you gonna keep doing that for the rest of my life?
No, only until you give up this ridiculous idea about leaving the country.
I'm not skipping bail.
I'd never make it.
Every cab driver, waitress and skycap between here and Sicily would be only too eager to talk to the police.
Why do you say that?
I under-tip.
Look, Ma, I know you're nervous, but Herb is a brilliant lawyer, and, honey, you have the love and support of all of us.
Is there anything I can get you from the kitchen?
Just bread and water.
Maybe I'll acquire a taste.
How's Sophia?
She's over that crazy idea about Sicily, but she's still very concerned about going to jail.
Well, who wouldn't be?
It's a terrifying prospect to think about.
Prison.
The coldness of it, the steel bars, the wedges of cheese hanging overhead, tantalizingly just out of reach.
Let me guess - St. Olaf County Jail?
And deli.
Look, we have to do everything we can to help Ma.
Now, the three of us have got to put our heads together and try to figure out for certain how that fire got started.
You're so right, Dorothy.
And we can start by ruling out the obvious.
Does Sophia have any friends who are or ever have been circus fire-eaters?
No.
Would she like to meet some?
Don't you worry.
Now we'll get to the bottom of this.
Lord knows we've worked our way out of tight spots before.
Who was it who got us into that Oh, just a minute, now I remember.
Come on, it's worth a try.
It's either we sing or he sings.
Oh, all right.
Boom Boom Well?
Well, what?
After my boom comes your boom and then yours, until we're all booming.
How complicated is that herring thing?
Boom Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom Boom Boom boom boom boom Boom Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom Boom Boom boom boom boom Mr. Sandman, bring me a dream Boom, boom, boom, boom Make him the cutest that I've ever seen Boom, boom, boom, boom Give him two lips like roses and clover Boom, boom, boom, boom Then tell him that his lonesome nights are over  Boom Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom Boom Boom, boom, boom, boom Boom Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom Boom Boom, boom, boom, boom Mr. Sandman Yes?
Bring me a dream Make him the cutest that I've ever seen Give him the word that I'm not a rover And tell him that his lonesome nights are over Mr. Sandman I'm so alone Boy, you guys really stink.
Look, I'm not going out with him.
You go, Blanche.
What?
!
You like him.
I know you do.
So you go.
Well, I couldn't.
Of course she couldn't.
You stay out of this, Dorothy.
Well, why not?
It's all over between us.
He'll know that tonight.
Well, it's impossible.
I'd feel like a I'd feel like a A back-stabbing slut?
No.
Then please go, for me.
I'd feel better knowing this thing is finally over with.
Well, since you put it that way But only as a personal favor to you, honey.
Well, I guess I'd better go get dressed.
Thank you, Blanche.
Can you believe that back-stabbing slut?
Well, now that we know we can work our way out of jams, exactly how are we gonna work our way out of this one?
There's one thing we could do.
We could get something to eat.
Can we concentrate?
It seems like all we ever do around here is eat.
Maybe it's all you ever do.
Oh, excuse me.
I forgot about all those other appetites you satisfy before going to the fridge.
My life is more than just sex and food.
I take care of this house.
Why, just the other day we had a leak, and the gas man came out.
Oh, no, wait a minute.
I guess that falls under sex.
And you did fix him a sandwich afterwards.
Oh, yeah.
I guess sex and food are a big part of our lives.
In fact, just recently - last summer, or last spring?
It's so hard to remember which Why does it have to be so hard?
The hardest part for me was explaining to my Kirsten the difference between boys and girls.
I knew the time had come, but I kept putting it off.
Finally, I decided it was time to take the bull by the horns.
So you told her?
No.
I took the bull by the horns, turned him around and showed her what makes a bull a bull.
You are kidding, Rose.
No.
That's how my mother taught me.
Honey, didn't that give you a false impression about what a man would look like?
It sure did.
Can you imagine my surprise on my wedding night with Charlie?
Boy, that bull would have been jealous.
Rose, quite frankly, I don't get it.
What is this hold that Buzz has over you?
I know exactly what she's going through.
First love can be very powerful.
I felt the same way about Heyward Boyle, the star pitcher on our high school baseball team.
Oh, an amazing athlete.
That boy had exceptional control.
He was always up for extra innings.
And his delivery.
Oh - All right, Blanche.
Enough!
Yeah.
We get it.
So, what was he like in bed?
I have to agree with Blanche on this one.
Half the fun is in getting there.
Boy, did your father and I have fun trying for you.
Ma, I don't think I want to hear this.
I wasn't gonna tell you until you're 60, but I think you can handle it now.
We lived in New York.
There was the San Gennaro Festival every year.
Your father - may he rest in peace until I get there - got so turned on by the festivities one year he couldn't wait till we got home.
Oh, Ma.
So he took me - right there behind the sausage and pepper stand.
Hey, we were behind the garbage cans.
It's not like we were in front of everybody.
I can relate to the festivities part, Sophia.
All our children were conceived on special St. Olaf holidays.
Adam was conceived on the Day of the Princess Pig when they had the pig crowning, and Ginella was conceived on Hay Day.
That's the day we St. Olafians celebrate hay.
Rose, do you think you could wrap this up before Rebecca goes into labor?
Then there was the Day of the Wheat, when everybody came to town dressed as sandwiches.
Charlie and I forgot to put cheese between us, and before I knew it, there was Kirsten.
Look, Blanche, what Rebecca is doing is really not so terrible.
Look, among the four of us, each of us conceived our children in a different way.
I was totally unconscious.
When I came to, there was Stan carving a notch in his dashboard.
I never bought that unconscious story.
I swear.
He must have slipped me something.
Apparently.
Those stories made me hungry.
They made me horny.
I'll tell you what.
Why don't we call the pizza guy?
See, we both win.
Hello?
What?
Oh, my God!
It's Ma.
She's at the airport.
They caught her trying to buy a ticket out of the country.
Can you believe Ma, trying to go to Sicily on my credit card?
She would've made it, too, if her chef's knife hadn't shown up on the scanner.
You want to know something crazy?
I actually feel responsible for this.
If I'd never checked her into Shady Pines, she never would have made those s'mores, there never would have been a fire, and none of this would have happened.
Hey, when you look at it like that, you are responsible.
Yeah, I never had thought about it that way.
You know, it is like they're trying the wrong person.
It is your fault.
Wait a second, girls.
Can you imagine being the one to put your mother in jail?
It was just a theory.
Follow that lady to Guilt City.
Now stop it, now stop it.
Look, nobody is to blame for this.
She's rationalizing.
Instead of pointing fingers, I thought we were gonna try to find a way out of this.
Well, we certainly are in the right place for it.
The kitchen - Crisis Central.
Yeah, we sure have solved a lot of problems in this room.
I mean, a lot.
Dorothy, it wasn't that long ago that you Oh, it's you.
I thought maybe Sophia had come home.
Oh, no.
She'll be back in the morning.
She's trying to teach me a lesson.
I know my mother.
Oh, really?
You're the one who said she wasn't gonna leave in the first place.
Dorothy, it's not just your mother who left.
I feel like she's my mother, too.
I know, but don't worry.
She'll be back.
Now that she's gone, who am I gonna go to in the middle of the night with my deepest personal problems?
Wait a minute.
You went to my mother's room in the middle of the night?
Many, many times.
Two or three times a week.
And she was always so kind and comforting.
I don't understand.
Every time I'd knock on her door late at night, she'd say, "Not now.
I'm watching Bob Costas".
Sophia doesn't have a TV in her room.
I know.
Then, after we finished talking, she'd always give me a piece of hard candy and a kiss good night.
I can't sleep.
And what's worse, I went to Sophia's room for one of our talks and then I remembered she left, thanks to you, Dorothy.
You had late-night talks with my mother?
All the time.
And she gave you hard candy?
No.
I'd ask, but she was always afraid I'd choke on it.
Why didn't somebody tell me it was dinnertime?
Ma, it's not dinner, it's the middle of the night.
Good.
Then I'm dressed for it.
Blanche is upset.
Well, you would be, too, if your daughter - Oh, I can't even say it.
What could have happened?
The two of you were getting so close.
My little girl is gonna have a baby by artificial insemination.
I just can't bear to think about it.
I'm just being silly, aren't I?
For God's sake, somebody say something.
Ew!
Big help.
Dorothy, what about you?
You're the sensible one around here, the free modern thinker who keeps up with the times.
Now, what do you think?
Ew.
Maybe we should all get some rest and figure a way out for Sophia tomorrow.
Yeah, you're probably right.
Dorothy, can we look in on Sophia, too?
She is like a mother to us.
I think she'd like that.
Here's the key.
I've been thinking about what we should do in case they do send Sophia off.
What, appeal?
No, a party, a prison party.
I made a list of all the men we should invite.
We'll be like the judges.
"I sentence you to ten minutes with me on the lanai".
See, some can be convicts and some can be guards What are you looking at?
I just cannot believe how much you think about men.
Well, hey, men are an important part of my life.
Not just my life.
They're an important part of all our lives.
Seems like hardly a day goes by here there's not an incident about some man that we're dating or used to date or want to date.
Pussycat, I'm going out with my friends.
Can you give me some money?
What happened to the money I gave you last night?
Let's see, 10 bucks went for cover charge, for a round of drinks, and the other 10 went into the G-string of a very cute male dancer named Mr. Big.
I know that guy.
That's just a stage name.
So, Ted, did I hear someone say you were a doctor?
He's not just a doctor.
He happens to be one of the top neurosurgeons in the Midwest.
Get out of here.
He's also heavy into real estate.
It's nothing much, really.
I just own a few mini-malls.
Oh, your wife must be very proud of you.
Actually, we're divorced.
Oh, I'm terribly, terribly sorry.
Hello, girls.
Dorothy, Rose, you all remember Laszlo.
Of course.
Laszlo, the artist from your museum.
Oh, we really enjoyed your lecture on modern sculpture.
I didn't think anyone was paying attention.
We sure were.
Especially Dorothy.
She even talked about taking up sculpting.
Really, Dorothy?
Oh, no, I didn't.
Yes, you did.
You said you'd like to help him mold his clay or buff his marble anytime.
Rose, you're such a kidder.
What is sex, after all?
Two clunky old bodies thrashing around against each other like animals.
You get all sweaty and flushed.
Your hair gets mussed.
You lose your breath.
You lose your earrings.
Your mouth waters.
Your nose runs.
Your heart races.
Your blood races.
Rose?
Say it, Ernie.
It's time, Rose.
Check, please!
I'm not saying I want her to go to prison.
I'm saying if she goes to prison, we have the theme for the party.
Girls, do I have news for you.
Rose, where have you been?
Trying to get hold of the fire inspector who inspected Shady Pines.
I wanted to double-check there wasn't anything wrong with the building.
And?
And get this.
They said the inspector quit three days after the Shady Pines fire.
It seems he mysteriously came into some money and moved to an exclusive Palm Beach neighborhood.
Do you know what that means?
Rose, of course I know what this means.
Then will you explain it to me?
It all sounded suspicious, but I couldn't quite piece it together.
Rose, you nitwit, that means the guy was probably on the take.
Oh, I told you everything would be fine, Ma.
Hey, I have an idea.
Let's have a getting-out-of-prison party.
See, everybody can pretend they've been locked up for about three years and they have all this pent-up sexual energy.
Everybody's all pumped up because all you ever do in prison is lift weights, so we'll get all those muscle guys with homemade tattoos What are you looking at?
You did a good job, but let's not forget there still has to be a trial, and Mrs. Heartgrove's confession is pretty strong.
I just wish we had something that reflected on her credibility.
What if we had a video of her and a friend mooning a hot dog vendor?
That would totally discredit her.
Wait a minute.
I just remembered who the friend was.
Can't use it.
Moving on.
If you think of anything else, please give me a call.
I have to be at the courthouse at a quarter to three.
There's no one in the place except you and me That's what we were singing that night.
We were having a couple of Nyquil shooters and singing "One For My Baby".
I remember.
Ma, you do?
Yeah.
I heard a smoke alarm, looked up, and saw flames coming out of the heater.
Maria was confused.
I grabbed her and the hot plate and ran out.
It was the heater.
Are you sure?
Sure I'm sure.
It was the heater.
You dig up that hot plate, Sophia, we'll go to the D.A. I think we've got enough evidence to get these charges dropped.
Ma, I am so proud of you.
Now, honey, if you could just remember where you left the hot plate.
I used it recently.
Think, Sophia, think.
What's that smell?
My God.
That's the smoke alarm in Sophia's room.
Oh, no!
Oh, yeah.
Anyone for s'mores?
Well, Sophia, how's it feel to be home?
I feel like a free man.
Well, you didn't actually go to jail.
OK, forget the free part.
I feel like a man.
I missed two estrogen shots, and I'm dying for a thick steak smothered in onions, a tall cold one, then going out and picking up a couple of - Ma.
Can I tell you something, Pussycat?
What?
I've never been so scared.
Not so much of jail.
It was not being here with all of you.
Only seeing you for ten minutes a day on visitors' day.
That's not enough time for Rose to get one of her St. Olaf stories off the runway.
All I'm trying to say is, maybe you're not much, but you're all I've got.
Am I crying, Pussycat?
No, Ma.
I guess it wasn't as touching as I thought.
Oh, Ma, I'm just glad everything worked out.
I never want to have to go through that again.
Oh, I knew it would all be OK.
Rose, I think you deserve a lot of the credit.
You were smart enough to double-check on that fire inspector.
Yes.
I'm proud of you, Rose.
Hey, you make it sound like it's the only smart thing I ever did.
I'll have you know I've done a lot of smart things over the years.
Remember?
{END OF EPISODE 24}{START OF EPISODE 25}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Hi, girls.
Oh, Rose, I missed you at breakfast.
Did you and Miles have fun last night?
Oh, yes.
We had dinner at the Mandarin Rathskeller, that new Chinese-German restaurant.
How was it?
Oh, the food was good.
But an hour later, Miles and I were both hungry.
For power.
Oh, my, that provincial Midwestern sense of humor that everybody hates.
Yes?
Hello.
I'm Detective Parres, Dade County P.D. Does a Sophia Petrillo reside here?
This is my mother.
Is there a problem?
I'd just like to ask a few questions.
I've got nothing to hide, copper.
Or do you prefer "flatfoot" or "gumshoe"?
Before my mother lost it completely, she watched a lot of James Cagney.
They colorized him.
Can you believe it?
Let the man rest.
He's got hair the color of Rose's and more rouge than Blanche.
Whatever you think she did, she's guilty.
I saw her.
Please sit down.
Mrs. Petrillo, where were you on the night of September 4th, 1985?
Did you see Awakenings?
Throw a ball at me.
How the hell should I know?
I don't even remember what color underwear I'm wearing.
Ma, the beginning of September.
That's when Shady Pines burned down and you came here to live with us.
Oh, yeah.
I'm not wearing underpants.
Mrs. Petrillo, were you acquainted with the late Maria Heartgrove?
She died?
Good riddance.
God rest her soul.
We have a deathbed confession from her stating that the two of you started the Shady Pines fire.
Why, that's ridiculous.
What did you do?
She claimed that on the night of the fire, the two of you were in your room cooking s'mores.
Nonsense.
I don't even know what s'mores are.
You remember, Sophia.
They're those little toasted graham cracker and chocolate sandwiches.
Marshmallow.
Don't forget the marshmallow.
Whoops.
In her deposition, Mrs. Heartgrove said that you were in possession of an illegal hot plate, and while you were cooking, the curtains caught on fire.
Then you panicked and fled, and the fire continued unchecked.
Now wait just a minute.
This is crazy.
Do you have any proof?
Did anybody find that alleged hot plate?
Presumably it was lost in the fire.
Maria was just out to get me.
She was always jealous because I still had my own hair.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Petrillo.
I have no choice but to bring you in on a charge of negligent arson.
My mother is 85 years old.
Surely you - I'm sorry.
The law recognizes no age limits.
Mrs. Petrillo, you're under arrest.
Well, all's well that ends well.
What?
It's a title of a Shakespeare play.
Rose, nothing is well, and nothing has ended.
Sophia's out on bail, awaiting her trial.
Well, if Dorothy had said it, you'd think it was brilliant.
So this is life on the outside.
It's changed.
You've all gotten so old.
Ma, knock it off.
You were gone an hour.
If anyone's upset, it should be me.
I had to dig up the bail money.
Please.
How do you put a price tag on getting your mother back?
What was it, $500?
Wow.
I better improve my attitude around here.
Well, Herb, here you are.
Hi.
Hi.
Girls, this is Herb Shrewsbury, our lawyer.
So, what are my chances, shyster?
Or do you prefer "ambulance chaser"?
Ma, he's here to help you.
Are you nuts?
If it helps.
Well, the trial is set for a month from now, so I'm going to need some character witnesses.
Maybe you should start by interviewing me.
I would make a wonderful witness.
I can't tell you how many times I've been badgered by lawyers.
Well, I could, but it might sound like boasting.
Oh, the stories I could tell you about me.
You're not gonna believe this, but I I shall become a great Southern writer, carrying on the tradition of the other great Southern writers like uh all those that are so famous they need not be mentioned.
Oh, girls, it's gonna be so exciting.
I am gonna make a fortune.
And I won't even have to use my imagination.
My life is a romance novel.
Your life is a sports page.
Listen.
Tell me I can't do better than this in my sleep.
"He grabbed her.
"She could feel his fingers pressing into her moist flesh.
"Her heart was pounding, her loins on fire as he spun her around, her dress ripping open" You know how many times I've experienced that?
Your loins have been on fire?
Yes.
"She melted into his -" Where exactly are your loins?
Rose, it doesn't matter.
Just listen.
"She melted into his arms, faint now with the animal musk of him" I didn't know people had loins.
I've heard of loin of pork, but In her case, the same thing.
Isn't this exciting - taking part in a protest?
Standing up as free Americans and exercising our right to say, "We're mad as hell and we're not gonna take it anymore".
I'm out of spit.
Can I go now?
and you're ready to quit?
We joined the Friends of Sea Mammals for a reason.
You are so unmotivated.
Well, when I joined this Mammals With Blowholes thing I didn't expect to be carrying picket signs on some grungy dock.
I was hoping more for a fund-raiser cocktail party with Chinese lanterns and Portuguese - no, Hispanic waiters in tight black pants.
And we hire a band to play fish songs in pirate suits with muscles bulging.
Your mouth is watering now, Blanche.
Keep licking.
Herb, I'm aware of how important it is to make a good impression in court.
Tell me, what do you think would move the jury more - cleavage or a lot of leg?
That depends on what you're going for - a chuckle or a guffaw.
Blanche, I think a conservative ensemble is in Sophia's best interest.
Oh, there'll be music?
Ma, where you going?
If he puts you three on the stand, up the river.
Ma, what are you doing up?
I can't sleep.
I keep trying to think back on that night at Shady Pines.
And?
And we're out of toilet paper.
I told you, Dorothy, I can't remember a thing.
Just because your memory is fuzzy doesn't mean that you're guilty.
Doesn't mean I'm innocent, either.
Ma!
Let's face it.
I've done some pretty peculiar things in my day.
Of course, I've got an excuse.
I'm an old lady.
I left my mind in the '60s.
Dorothy, have you seen my teeth?
They're in your mouth, Ma.
I know that.
Don't they look good today?
I ran them through the dishwasher.
Ma, listen to me.
You got Martha Raye and Madge mixed up again.
Morning, Blanche.
Morning, Ma.
You sleep well?
No.
I had that recurring nightmare, the one where I'm in bed with Warren Beatty and he says, "Sorry, this is too sick, even for me".
Well, now I know why Hemingway killed himself.
Oh, girls, I have writer's block.
It is the worst feeling in the world.
Try ten days without a bowel movement sometime.
You just sit there, hour after hour after hour.
Tell me about it.
Frisk me.
Oh, Ma, stop that.
What are you doing?
Just frisk me.
Frisk me.
It's important practice for me if I'm going to prison.
Ma, you are not going to prison.
Now think back.
Shady Pines.
What was the last thing that you remember before that fire?
Meat loaf.
Nine days in a row.
Their only witness is dead.
That ought to work in our favor.
Dorothy, that hot plate was mine.
I made s'mores all the time.
I hated Shady Pines.
I can't remember, but I know I did it.
I must have.
I'm goin' to prison.
Ma won't come out of her room.
She's miserable.
Just to keep me up to speed, Dorothy - it's this negligent arson rap and the prospect of spending the rest of her waning years in jail thing, right?
No, it's the "Rose in the kitchen" thing.
I just hate to see Sophia so unhappy.
I wish there was something we could do to make her feel better.
I mean, we're always there when we need each other.
You know, if I have a problem, Rose is there for me, and if Dorothy has a problem, I'm there for her.
I wish I knew what to do.
All right.
All right.
I can pick up a cue.
Picture it.
Sicily, 1912.
A beautiful young peasant girl with clear olive skin meets an exciting but penniless Spanish artist.
There's an instant attraction.
They laugh, they sing, they slam down a few boilermakers.
Shortly afterwards, he's arrested for showing her how he can hold his palette without using his hands.
But I digress.
He paints her portrait, and they make passionate love.
She spends much of the next day in the shower with a loofah sponge scrubbing his fingerprints off her body.
She sees the portrait and is insulted - it looks nothing like her - and she storms out of his life forever.
That peasant girl was me and that painter was Pablo Picasso.
Ma, I have a feeling you're lying.
Be positive, Dorothy.
OK, I'm positive you're lying.
This is terrible.
Trick move from your checkers-by-mail partner?
No, it's from the company Charlie worked for.
They've gone bankrupt and so has their pension fund.
I'm not gonna be getting pension checks anymore.
I can't afford to live without that pension.
Let's not panic.
I'm sure they can't just cut you off.
She's right.
There has to be a good explanation.
You'll call them tomorrow.
Everything will be fine.
What if it's not?
What if I can't pay my own way?
What if I can't afford food?
What if I have to sleep outside in some park?
There's an old Italian saying for times like this.
Scappa.
Tu si mal fortuna.
What does that mean?
Get away from me.
You're bad luck.
OK, that's it.
Drink this.
It's a secret potion from the old country guaranteed to put you to sleep.
Looks like milk.
Trust me, Rose.
Drink it.
Slowly.
That's right, down the hatch.
We call this Sicilian Sominex.
Now, you might feel a slight tingling, but believe me, you'll sleep like a baby.
I don't feel any tingling.
When's it gonna hit me?
Sophia!
Oh, I just had a terrible thought.
What if, in some weird way, all this was true and Ma went to jail?
Oh, my God.
This is very important, Rose.
It might take a couple of hours, so relax and get comfortable.
The last time someone said that to me, I had two pigs on my back and I was pushing a wheelbarrow.
Why?
To relax and get comfortable.
OK, now, where should I begin?
Let's see.
I think the one thing you need to know is that I'm the one around here with the level head, the real voice of reason.
I haven't been this scared since 1952 when St. Olaf's most active volcano threatened to erupt.
Luckily there were some Druid priests who were in town for the opening of Stonehengeland.
They said they could stop it if they could sacrifice the town's dumbest virgin.
I don't know why I raised my hand.
It must have just been the excitement of the moment.
But they said the only way to prevent the eruption was for me to crawl through their legs up the volcano while they gave me my birthday whacks.
Well - and you're not gonna believe this - it turns out they weren't Druid priests at all, just a bunch of Shriners looking for a good time.
All creatures must learn to coexist.
Back where I come from, they do.
That's why the brown bear and the field mouse can share their lives and live in harmony.
'Course, they can't mate or the mice would explode.
You want me to drive tonight, Dorothy?
Oh, Rose, listen.
I'm not going to the meeting tonight.
Oh?
How come?
I'm not comfortable there.
I'm not comfortable with the people, with the whole thing.
But you need the group support, Dorothy.
It's not a good idea to go it alone.
Did I ever tell you about my cousin Vigdov Frickin?
He tried to go it alone in a three-legged race.
Well, you know what happened to him?
Please.
Please, Rose!
I don't want to hear about your Frickin cousin.
That was very interesting, Rose, but now that I've heard you, I think I'll probably just plead insanity.
You look perfectly sane to me.
High praise indeed.
Pussycat, when I go to trial, will you be a character witness for me, tell them I'm sweet and cute and don't have it in me to harm a fly?
What, you want me to perjure myself?
Basically.
Ma, don't worry.
Everything's gonna be fine.
Thank you for trying to cheer me up, Pussycat.
You're always there for me.
I appreciate that.
We're there for each other.
I don't know of any other mothers and daughters who have gone through half of what we've gone through.
I can't tell you how much it meant to me when you and I Two-and-a-half hours.
I thought you died.
What's wrong with you?
Nothing.
Who are you?
I'm the doctor.
We'll see about that.
Look, Mrs Petrillo.
I'm Dorothy's mother.
I wanna know what's wrong with her.
Don't tell me "nothing," because I know there's something wrong with her.
Mothers know.
Look, Ma, I'll talk to you about it later.
Your daughter is fine, Mrs. Petrillo.
Tip-top?
Tip-top.
Then, Mr. 100% Tip-top, why the hell does she feel like hell?
Look, Ma Wait.
I gotta hear this.
It could be functional.
Functional?
Mental.
Mental.
Well, let me tell you something, Mr. 100% Tip-top Mental, my daughter may be no spring chicken and her jaw might crack when she chews and she may have noticeable trouble digesting raw vegetables, but one thing she's not is mental.
Thanks, Ma.
OK, girls, I'm ready.
Well, Rose, do I look like the mayor of Palm Springs?
Doug Henning is the mayor of Palm Springs?
Just play the music, Rose.
They say we're young and we don't know We won't find out until we grow I don't know if all that's true But you got me and, baby, I got you Babe I got you, babe I got you, babe You know, Ma, I guess we do have a good relationship.
It's always been good.
I know we never did some of those mother/daughter things - baking cookies, dressing alike, braiding each other's hair.
Yeah, but wasn't it great making fun of those who did?
It sure was.
But come on, Ma.
The truth is, we have done our share of fighting.
Of course we fight.
We're Italian.
We like to fight.
It's our way of showing love.
Though I don't know if there was a lot of love that time that we Hi, Ma.
Gimme your watch.
Sure.
What do you want it for?
I'm working on a magic act for the talent show at the center.
Abracadabra, 1, 2, 3.
Ma!
Relax.
Dorothy, was your card the ace of spades?
Ma, what the hell are you talking about?
I think I got chapters seven and nine mixed up.
Ohh.
This watch is broken.
Ma, Stan gave me that watch when we got married.
The marriage never worked.
Why should the watch?
I waited up for you until two in the morning, and you still weren't home.
Oh, yeah.
Gertie and I and some of the girls went to Wolfie's to pick up guys.
I called Wolfie's at 11.
You weren't there.
Guess who got lucky.
Oh, God!
What can I tell you?
A couple of egg creams, the bright fluorescent lights and a retired jeweler named Shlomo all conspired to make a night of enchantment.
Not for me.
I can't tell you some of the horrible thoughts I had about what might have happened to you.
Although none as horrible as what you just described.
Ah, there you are.
Ma, I scheduled the appointment for your checkup.
Ma, you know you have to have a physical.
What do you want me to do - take you to court, have you declared incompetent?
I'm not incompetent.
Once when I laughed too hard, I had a little accident.
I guess we do have a strange way of showing our affection.
Oh, Ma, I'm glad to see you've cheered up, but why are you walking down memory lane all of a sudden?
It's just that I may not see you for a while.
Ma, they can't prove that you started that fire at Shady Pines, and you are not going to jail.
You can't be sure of that, Pussycat, so I'm doing what I have to do.
I'm jumping bail and moving back to Sicily.
Oh, hi, Ma.
How was your nap?
Nap?
I didn't take a nap.
I'm a nervous wreck.
How could I sleep a wink with this prison thing hanging over my head?
Let's grab lunch.
Ma, it's dinnertime.
Oh, I guess I did take a nap.
Ma, I don't know why you're nervous.
You are not going to prison.
I feel like I am in prison, with you keeping an eye on me 24 hours a day.
Are you gonna keep doing that for the rest of my life?
No, only until you give up this ridiculous idea about leaving the country.
I'm not skipping bail.
I'd never make it.
Every cab driver, waitress and skycap between here and Sicily would be only too eager to talk to the police.
Why do you say that?
I under-tip.
Look, Ma, I know you're nervous, but Herb is a brilliant lawyer, and, honey, you have the love and support of all of us.
Is there anything I can get you from the kitchen?
Just bread and water.
Maybe I'll acquire a taste.
How's Sophia?
She's over that crazy idea about Sicily, but she's still very concerned about going to jail.
Well, who wouldn't be?
It's a terrifying prospect to think about.
Prison.
The coldness of it, the steel bars, the wedges of cheese hanging overhead, tantalizingly just out of reach.
Let me guess - St. Olaf County Jail?
And deli.
Look, we have to do everything we can to help Ma.
Now, the three of us have got to put our heads together and try to figure out for certain how that fire got started.
You're so right, Dorothy.
And we can start by ruling out the obvious.
Does Sophia have any friends who are or ever have been circus fire-eaters?
No.
Would she like to meet some?
Don't you worry.
Now we'll get to the bottom of this.
Lord knows we've worked our way out of tight spots before.
Who was it who got us into that Oh, just a minute, now I remember.
Come on, it's worth a try.
It's either we sing or he sings.
Oh, all right.
Boom Boom Well?
Well, what?
After my boom comes your boom and then yours, until we're all booming.
How complicated is that herring thing?
Boom Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom Boom Boom boom boom boom Boom Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom Boom Boom boom boom boom Mr. Sandman, bring me a dream Boom, boom, boom, boom Make him the cutest that I've ever seen Boom, boom, boom, boom Give him two lips like roses and clover Boom, boom, boom, boom Then tell him that his lonesome nights are over  Boom Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom Boom Boom, boom, boom, boom Boom Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom Boom Boom, boom, boom, boom Mr. Sandman Yes?
Bring me a dream Make him the cutest that I've ever seen Give him the word that I'm not a rover And tell him that his lonesome nights are over Mr. Sandman I'm so alone Boy, you guys really stink.
Look, I'm not going out with him.
You go, Blanche.
What?
!
You like him.
I know you do.
So you go.
Well, I couldn't.
Of course she couldn't.
You stay out of this, Dorothy.
Well, why not?
It's all over between us.
He'll know that tonight.
Well, it's impossible.
I'd feel like a I'd feel like a A back-stabbing slut?
No.
Then please go, for me.
I'd feel better knowing this thing is finally over with.
Well, since you put it that way But only as a personal favor to you, honey.
Well, I guess I'd better go get dressed.
Thank you, Blanche.
Can you believe that back-stabbing slut?
Well, now that we know we can work our way out of jams, exactly how are we gonna work our way out of this one?
There's one thing we could do.
We could get something to eat.
Can we concentrate?
It seems like all we ever do around here is eat.
Maybe it's all you ever do.
Oh, excuse me.
I forgot about all those other appetites you satisfy before going to the fridge.
My life is more than just sex and food.
I take care of this house.
Why, just the other day we had a leak, and the gas man came out.
Oh, no, wait a minute.
I guess that falls under sex.
And you did fix him a sandwich afterwards.
Oh, yeah.
I guess sex and food are a big part of our lives.
In fact, just recently - last summer, or last spring?
It's so hard to remember which Why does it have to be so hard?
The hardest part for me was explaining to my Kirsten the difference between boys and girls.
I knew the time had come, but I kept putting it off.
Finally, I decided it was time to take the bull by the horns.
So you told her?
No.
I took the bull by the horns, turned him around and showed her what makes a bull a bull.
You are kidding, Rose.
No.
That's how my mother taught me.
Honey, didn't that give you a false impression about what a man would look like?
It sure did.
Can you imagine my surprise on my wedding night with Charlie?
Boy, that bull would have been jealous.
Rose, quite frankly, I don't get it.
What is this hold that Buzz has over you?
I know exactly what she's going through.
First love can be very powerful.
I felt the same way about Heyward Boyle, the star pitcher on our high school baseball team.
Oh, an amazing athlete.
That boy had exceptional control.
He was always up for extra innings.
And his delivery.
Oh - All right, Blanche.
Enough!
Yeah.
We get it.
So, what was he like in bed?
I have to agree with Blanche on this one.
Half the fun is in getting there.
Boy, did your father and I have fun trying for you.
Ma, I don't think I want to hear this.
I wasn't gonna tell you until you're 60, but I think you can handle it now.
We lived in New York.
There was the San Gennaro Festival every year.
Your father - may he rest in peace until I get there - got so turned on by the festivities one year he couldn't wait till we got home.
Oh, Ma.
So he took me - right there behind the sausage and pepper stand.
Hey, we were behind the garbage cans.
It's not like we were in front of everybody.
I can relate to the festivities part, Sophia.
All our children were conceived on special St. Olaf holidays.
Adam was conceived on the Day of the Princess Pig when they had the pig crowning, and Ginella was conceived on Hay Day.
That's the day we St. Olafians celebrate hay.
Rose, do you think you could wrap this up before Rebecca goes into labor?
Then there was the Day of the Wheat, when everybody came to town dressed as sandwiches.
Charlie and I forgot to put cheese between us, and before I knew it, there was Kirsten.
Look, Blanche, what Rebecca is doing is really not so terrible.
Look, among the four of us, each of us conceived our children in a different way.
I was totally unconscious.
When I came to, there was Stan carving a notch in his dashboard.
I never bought that unconscious story.
I swear.
He must have slipped me something.
Apparently.
Those stories made me hungry.
They made me horny.
I'll tell you what.
Why don't we call the pizza guy?
See, we both win.
Hello?
What?
Oh, my God!
It's Ma.
She's at the airport.
They caught her trying to buy a ticket out of the country.
Can you believe Ma, trying to go to Sicily on my credit card?
She would've made it, too, if her chef's knife hadn't shown up on the scanner.
You want to know something crazy?
I actually feel responsible for this.
If I'd never checked her into Shady Pines, she never would have made those s'mores, there never would have been a fire, and none of this would have happened.
Hey, when you look at it like that, you are responsible.
Yeah, I never had thought about it that way.
You know, it is like they're trying the wrong person.
It is your fault.
Wait a second, girls.
Can you imagine being the one to put your mother in jail?
It was just a theory.
Follow that lady to Guilt City.
Now stop it, now stop it.
Look, nobody is to blame for this.
She's rationalizing.
Instead of pointing fingers, I thought we were gonna try to find a way out of this.
Well, we certainly are in the right place for it.
The kitchen - Crisis Central.
Yeah, we sure have solved a lot of problems in this room.
I mean, a lot.
Dorothy, it wasn't that long ago that you Oh, it's you.
I thought maybe Sophia had come home.
Oh, no.
She'll be back in the morning.
She's trying to teach me a lesson.
I know my mother.
Oh, really?
You're the one who said she wasn't gonna leave in the first place.
Dorothy, it's not just your mother who left.
I feel like she's my mother, too.
I know, but don't worry.
She'll be back.
Now that she's gone, who am I gonna go to in the middle of the night with my deepest personal problems?
Wait a minute.
You went to my mother's room in the middle of the night?
Many, many times.
Two or three times a week.
And she was always so kind and comforting.
I don't understand.
Every time I'd knock on her door late at night, she'd say, "Not now.
I'm watching Bob Costas".
Sophia doesn't have a TV in her room.
I know.
Then, after we finished talking, she'd always give me a piece of hard candy and a kiss good night.
I can't sleep.
And what's worse, I went to Sophia's room for one of our talks and then I remembered she left, thanks to you, Dorothy.
You had late-night talks with my mother?
All the time.
And she gave you hard candy?
No.
I'd ask, but she was always afraid I'd choke on it.
Why didn't somebody tell me it was dinnertime?
Ma, it's not dinner, it's the middle of the night.
Good.
Then I'm dressed for it.
Blanche is upset.
Well, you would be, too, if your daughter - Oh, I can't even say it.
What could have happened?
The two of you were getting so close.
My little girl is gonna have a baby by artificial insemination.
I just can't bear to think about it.
I'm just being silly, aren't I?
For God's sake, somebody say something.
Ew!
Big help.
Dorothy, what about you?
You're the sensible one around here, the free modern thinker who keeps up with the times.
Now, what do you think?
Ew.
Maybe we should all get some rest and figure a way out for Sophia tomorrow.
Yeah, you're probably right.
Dorothy, can we look in on Sophia, too?
She is like a mother to us.
I think she'd like that.
Here's the key.
I've been thinking about what we should do in case they do send Sophia off.
What, appeal?
No, a party, a prison party.
I made a list of all the men we should invite.
We'll be like the judges.
"I sentence you to ten minutes with me on the lanai".
See, some can be convicts and some can be guards What are you looking at?
I just cannot believe how much you think about men.
Well, hey, men are an important part of my life.
Not just my life.
They're an important part of all our lives.
Seems like hardly a day goes by here there's not an incident about some man that we're dating or used to date or want to date.
Pussycat, I'm going out with my friends.
Can you give me some money?
What happened to the money I gave you last night?
Let's see, 10 bucks went for cover charge, for a round of drinks, and the other 10 went into the G-string of a very cute male dancer named Mr. Big.
I know that guy.
That's just a stage name.
So, Ted, did I hear someone say you were a doctor?
He's not just a doctor.
He happens to be one of the top neurosurgeons in the Midwest.
Get out of here.
He's also heavy into real estate.
It's nothing much, really.
I just own a few mini-malls.
Oh, your wife must be very proud of you.
Actually, we're divorced.
Oh, I'm terribly, terribly sorry.
Hello, girls.
Dorothy, Rose, you all remember Laszlo.
Of course.
Laszlo, the artist from your museum.
Oh, we really enjoyed your lecture on modern sculpture.
I didn't think anyone was paying attention.
We sure were.
Especially Dorothy.
She even talked about taking up sculpting.
Really, Dorothy?
Oh, no, I didn't.
Yes, you did.
You said you'd like to help him mold his clay or buff his marble anytime.
Rose, you're such a kidder.
What is sex, after all?
Two clunky old bodies thrashing around against each other like animals.
You get all sweaty and flushed.
Your hair gets mussed.
You lose your breath.
You lose your earrings.
Your mouth waters.
Your nose runs.
Your heart races.
Your blood races.
Rose?
Say it, Ernie.
It's time, Rose.
Check, please!
I'm not saying I want her to go to prison.
I'm saying if she goes to prison, we have the theme for the party.
Girls, do I have news for you.
Rose, where have you been?
Trying to get hold of the fire inspector who inspected Shady Pines.
I wanted to double-check there wasn't anything wrong with the building.
And?
And get this.
They said the inspector quit three days after the Shady Pines fire.
It seems he mysteriously came into some money and moved to an exclusive Palm Beach neighborhood.
Do you know what that means?
Rose, of course I know what this means.
Then will you explain it to me?
It all sounded suspicious, but I couldn't quite piece it together.
Rose, you nitwit, that means the guy was probably on the take.
Oh, I told you everything would be fine, Ma.
Hey, I have an idea.
Let's have a getting-out-of-prison party.
See, everybody can pretend they've been locked up for about three years and they have all this pent-up sexual energy.
Everybody's all pumped up because all you ever do in prison is lift weights, so we'll get all those muscle guys with homemade tattoos What are you looking at?
You did a good job, but let's not forget there still has to be a trial, and Mrs. Heartgrove's confession is pretty strong.
I just wish we had something that reflected on her credibility.
What if we had a video of her and a friend mooning a hot dog vendor?
That would totally discredit her.
Wait a minute.
I just remembered who the friend was.
Can't use it.
Moving on.
If you think of anything else, please give me a call.
I have to be at the courthouse at a quarter to three.
There's no one in the place except you and me That's what we were singing that night.
We were having a couple of Nyquil shooters and singing "One For My Baby".
I remember.
Ma, you do?
Yeah.
I heard a smoke alarm, looked up, and saw flames coming out of the heater.
Maria was confused.
I grabbed her and the hot plate and ran out.
It was the heater.
Are you sure?
Sure I'm sure.
It was the heater.
You dig up that hot plate, Sophia, we'll go to the D.A. I think we've got enough evidence to get these charges dropped.
Ma, I am so proud of you.
Now, honey, if you could just remember where you left the hot plate.
I used it recently.
Think, Sophia, think.
What's that smell?
My God.
That's the smoke alarm in Sophia's room.
Oh, no!
Oh, yeah.
Anyone for s'mores?
Well, Sophia, how's it feel to be home?
I feel like a free man.
Well, you didn't actually go to jail.
OK, forget the free part.
I feel like a man.
I missed two estrogen shots, and I'm dying for a thick steak smothered in onions, a tall cold one, then going out and picking up a couple of - Ma.
Can I tell you something, Pussycat?
What?
I've never been so scared.
Not so much of jail.
It was not being here with all of you.
Only seeing you for ten minutes a day on visitors' day.
That's not enough time for Rose to get one of her St. Olaf stories off the runway.
All I'm trying to say is, maybe you're not much, but you're all I've got.
Am I crying, Pussycat?
No, Ma.
I guess it wasn't as touching as I thought.
Oh, Ma, I'm just glad everything worked out.
I never want to have to go through that again.
Oh, I knew it would all be OK.
Rose, I think you deserve a lot of the credit.
You were smart enough to double-check on that fire inspector.
Yes.
I'm proud of you, Rose.
Hey, you make it sound like it's the only smart thing I ever did.
I'll have you know I've done a lot of smart things over the years.
Remember?
{END OF EPISODE 25}{START OF EPISODE 26}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Oh my gosh.
It's only one week till spring break?
And I have so much to do.
I have to get new T-shirts for the wet T-shirt contest You know, I'm actually looking forward to spring break this year.
College kids.
America's best and brightest are coming to town.
It'll be nice to get mooned again.
It's more than that, Ma.
I'm talking about my school's project to get kids to read during spring vacation.
We're putting on a series of plays based on favorite children's stories.
And guess what.
I have just been made producer of the first-grade production.
This is all you have, Dorothy, so I'm going to be happy for you.
No, you know, I'm really excited about this.
We're doing Henny Penny.
You know, "Help, help!
The sky is falling".
Oh, that was never one of my favorites.
There's no prince in it.
I like a fairy tale with a nice prince in it.
A handsome prince with a big ol' codpiece and deep dark eyes and powerful thighs and muscles rippling beneath his tunic.
Blanche, you could get aroused by "Humpty Dumpty".
Are you kiddin'?
"All the king's horses and all the king's men".
Handsome men with deep dark eyes and powerful thighs and muscles and big ol' codpieces.
Blanche, how do you make it through an omelet?
Ma, what are you doing?
Reading the obituaries and checking out the people who died younger than I am now.
What is it?
You.
What about me?
You're dead.
Say what?
I told you.
You're dead.
You must be.
It says so in the paper.
"Blanche Devereaux.
Age 68".
68?
Oh, that's terrible.
They're almost as far off on your age as you are.
I wonder how this could've happened.
I know how it happened, 'cause I know who took that picture.
Chugger Dietz, the obituary editor.
I never dreamed when I dropped him he'd be so vindictive.
believe that?
68?
And dead.
Don't forget dead.
I'm going down to that newspaper this minute.
Not only am I gonna get Chugger fired, if I hurry I can get 'em to print a retraction in this afternoon's edition.
And dead.
What are people gonna think?
They'll think it's time to elect a new town slut.
Mail call.
Ah, Ma.
Here's a letter for you from Palermo.
Oh, it's the latest chess move from my old rival Serafina Gambrotsi.
Ma, how long has this chess game by mail been going on?
What, it must be ten years now, huh?
And it's going to keep on going until I beat Serafina at something.
What are you talking about?
Picture it.
Sicily, 1920.
Serafina and I were both crazy about Marco the Goat Boy.
In appearance, an Adonis.
In behavior, horny as a toad.
Little did I know he had a thing for hairy fat girls.
If I were fatter and hairier, Dorothy, Marco the Goat Boy could've been your father.
I think we all grieve.
Ma, that was 70 years ago.
I was sure you'd forgotten.
I forget nothing.
So, any mail?
Oh, Frank.
Come on in.
Ma, Frank Nann.
Frank, my mother.
Hello, Frank.
Ma, Frank is directing the production of Henny Penny.
Not anymore I'm not.
One of the kids in the play came down with the measles.
Because the audience is going to be children, too, the entire cast has been quarantined.
Oh, what are we gonna do?
I guess we'll have to cancel.
Oh, no, we can't cancel.
First grade is when kids take an interest in reading.
Why can't we recast it with adults?
Where are we going to find an adult with the childlike naivetÃ© to play Henny Penny?
Hi.
Oh, you're not gonna believe it.
I just saw a cloud that looked exactly like a cotton ball.
My God, she is Henny Penny.
I beg your pardon?
Frank Nann, Rose Nylund.
Rose, my entire cast has been quarantined.
We're in a real bind.
How would you like to play Henny Penny?
Well, I have enjoyed playing a hen in the past.
Oh, fill us in.
Parade, honeymoon or religious ceremony?
Theater.
The St. Olaf Masquers' production of Hamlet.
I don't right off recall a hen in Hamlet.
Oh, we set the play in a barnyard.
Luckily the symphony was out of town at the time.
Can I take it then that you will play Henny Penny?
I'm your chicken.
Great, I'll set the oven for 425.
Well, Frank Nann.
I haven't seen you since that weekend in Pensacola.
Goosey Loosey.
That's right.
We did have fun, Squeezy Wheezy.
No, no, I mean you'd be perfect for the part of Goosey Loosey.
We've had to recast Henny Penny.
I'm playing Henny.
Oh, and Frank's directing?
Oh, what fun!
I would love to.
Oh, wonderful, wonderful.
Then all we have to do is just order the costumes and change a few lines so that it makes sense that the two of you are playing those characters.
Now, listen, Dorothy, since both of your housemates are going to be in the play, why don't you play Turkey Lurkey?
Oh come on.
No, no, no.
No, that's out of the question.
Why?
You'd be perfect.
"Turkey Lurkey" was your nickname in high school.
Ma, it was not.
Really?
That's what they called you at the PTA.
Come on, Dorothy.
It'll be fun.
Yeah, come on.
Be a trouper.
Well, I did once do a production of Showboat in high school, and everyone said I was pretty good.
No one can sing "Old Man River" like my Dorothy.
Then you're saying you'll do it?
Well, it is my production, and as they say, "The show must go on".
Aw, Pussycat.
It'll be like the old days.
Come on, just one more time.
Get a little drunk And you land in jail I still got it.
Yes!
I've got that tub of guts where I want her.
My queen's knight attacks her king.
Banzai!
Ma, how did two Sicilian peasant girls ever become interested in chess?
Chess is like war, only cheaper.
It's the perfect game for Sicily, a country very warlike and dead-ass broke.
Well, they printed the retraction.
Let me see it.
I can't find it.
Of course you can't.
It's way down at the bottom in itty-bitty type.
"Our ad in yesterday's paper should have read 'Sit Well Cortisone Salve Prevents Hemorrhoids, ' not 'Presents Hemorrhoids.
'" Below that.
Oh, nobody's ever gonna even see it.
Everybody's gonna still think I'm 68.
And dead.
Why does she keep forgetting dead?
This is horrible.
As Big Daddy used to say, "I'm feeling lower than the rent on a burnin' building".
That's funny.
I used to live in a burning building.
And it was cheap.
It was Charlie's and my first house.
Well, scoff if you must, but it was warm and toasty.
I'll never forget Charlie throwing me over his shoulder and dashing across the threshold.
Oh, it was a beautiful place.
Three bedrooms, two baths.
Then two bedrooms and one bath.
Eventually, we outgrew the place.
Rose, come on now.
You haven't said a word since we left rehearsal.
Nobody told me Henny Penny ended that way.
Nobody told me it was a tragedy.
Rose, you've been rehearsing for three days.
Why are you makin' a scene now?
Well, that was the first time we rehearsed the ending.
I didn't know that Turkey and Henny and Goosey were all eaten by Foxy Loxy.
Oh, the humanity.
Rose, you mean you didn't even look at the end of the play until today?
If there's one thing I remember about my wedding night, it's Charlie telling me it's impolite to peek.
Rose, the play isn't real.
It's a fairy tale.
Not all stories end happily, and children have to learn that.
You call yourself a teacher?
It's people like you who are responsible for all the evil on this planet.
I guess I had that coming.
I'm not gonna stand by and see innocent children exposed to that horror story of unprovoked violence and ghastly death.
Rose, the play goes on in two days.
Well, I can't do this.
You're just gonna have to get yourself another Henny Penny.
Rose, honey, there's no reason to be upset about Henny Penny.
Fairy tales just show kids how complicated life can be, and it does it on their terms.
I remember when I first read Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, it had a profound influence on me.
Seven lonely men livin' in the woods, needin' a woman.
All of 'em with Napoleon complexes, somethin' to prove.
And jobs, Blanche.
They all had jobs.
In a diamond mine.
All I'm trying to say is we had fairy tales in St. Olaf that weren't violent, and they had positive role models.
Like Gus and the Recliner Gunilla Gets a Catalog, and Ilsa, the Girl Who Could Make Bad Food Good.
Look, Rose, if you don't do the part, there won't be any play.
Now, this is a project that I care about deeply, but I don't want you doing it for my sake, Rose.
Do it for the kids.
It's a chance to get them reading.
All right, all right, I'll do it.
And not just for the kids.
I just feel it's time I gave something back to the chicken community.
After all, a chicken once saved my life.
They are the stupidest birds.
Any mail for me?
Mm, no.
No condolence cards?
Well, where's the outpouring of grief from all the many, many men whose lives I have left barren and empty?
Maybe they just don't know you by your real name.
Well, here it is!
Serafina's next chess move.
Perfect.
I already know my next move.
And when Serafina sees it, her hair will fall out, her heart will stop, her eyes will burn like a thousand red-hot suns.
Ma, why do you keep playing this game if you hate her so much?
To relax.
Flowers for Blanche Deverucks.
No, that's "Devereaux".
It's only pronounced "Deverucks" in limericks.
Well, Blanche, here you are.
You say nobody cares about you?
What do you say now?
Oh!
From Mel Bushman.
Good ol' Mel.
The only person I can always count on.
"Dear Blanche, when I heard of your death, "it made me realize you don't know what you have till you've lost it.
So I'm back with my ex-wife.
Love, Mel".
Now that is the most insensitive thing I have ever heard.
"P.S. Sorry I missed your birthday.
Happy 68th".
It doesn't say that.
I know.
I made that part up.
Ma, why are you always trying to aggravate everyone?
To relax.
"Once upon a time "on a beautiful spring day, "Henny Penny was waking up from a nap under an oak tree "when an acorn fell from the tree and hit her on the head".
Funny, when I was a little girl in Sicily and they told this story, it was a safe that fell on her head.
"Anyway, Henny Penny being a chicken, "not the brightest bird in the world, immediately jumped to the wrong conclusion".
Oh, dear.
A piece of blue sky just fell on my head The wherefore and why is best left unsaid But I have a hunch and it's appalling That like it or not, the sky is falling "Henny decided to take action".
I should go and warn the king!
"And off she went.
"On her way, Henny came upon Goosey Loosey" "one of the most popular birds in the barnyard".
The most popular.
And the eighth graders are seeing a play today about how to be that popular safely.
Well, Henny Penny, I do declare, honey, where are you rushing off to?
The sky is falling.
I'm off to warn the king.
Are you sure?
Of course I'm sure.
I don't need something to hit me in the head in order to get the message.
Actually, in this case, it did hit me in the head.
Oh, dear!
A piece of up there just landed down here You better beware, the message is clear Though millions may find the prospect galling It's run for your life, the sky is falling This is terrible.
I think we best both go warn the king.
"And off they went.
"On their way, Henny Penny "and Goosey Loosey came upon Turkey Lurkey".
Yes, poor lonely Turkey Lurkey.
Poor dateless, hopeless, self-basting - Ma!
And where are you two featherheads fluttering off to?
Terrible news.
The sky is falling!
What?
!
A piece of it hit me in the head.
Are you sure?
Doesn't she act as if something hit her in the head?
We're off to warn the king.
Oh, dear!
A piece of blue sky just did what they said Don't stand there and sigh Get under the bed Don't stop to complain, it's no good grumbling 'Cause this isn't rain, the sky is crumbling Oh, this is terrible news.
I think we best all go warn the king.
"And off they went".
"On their way, Henny Penny, Goosey Loosey and Turkey Lurkey came upon Foxy Loxy".
Ladies, ladies, why are you in such a hurry?
Stop and smell the flowers.
We can't.
The sky is falling.
Run that by me once again?
Ohh.
A piece of blue sky Just fell on her head Just fell on my head The wherefore and why are best left unsaid But we have a hunch, and it's appalling That like it or not, the sky is falling Help!
Disaster is near Help!
We're tremblin' with fear Help.
The outlook is drear We're dreadin' Armageddon may disrupt our career And though he may refuse the news we bring We must fly and try to warn the king  This is terrible news indeed.
But it is good luck for all of us that we ran into each other.
It so happens I know a shortcut to the palace.
Really?
Yes.
Through my den.
There's a service entrance in the rear.
Oh, thank you Thank you so much.
We'll never forget this.
You're right.
I lied.
There is no service entrance.
A piece of good luck just fell in my lap Three strangers who cluck, well, it's their mishap These friends who dropped in don't look suspicious But check out my grin, they look delicious To me these feathered fools are so much meat I and mine shall dine Bon appÃ©tit   "And from that day to this, "Turkey Lurkey, Goosey Loosey and Henny Penny were never seen -" Stop!
Children, kids, it's up to you.
I mean, if you want to save us and not have us eaten by Foxy Loxy, applaud.
I mean it!
I mean, clap now if you want to see the goose and the chicken and the turkey live.
Come on, put your little hands together.
Save us, and you won't have bad dreams.
Clap, you miserable - Come on, Henny, let's get it over with.
But what about their bad dreams?
Let's go.
Come on.
Fine.
But I just want you all to know there are monsters living under all your beds.
Uh-oh.
I don't think Serafina's a worthy opponent for me anymore.
Why not, Sophia?
I'm afraid she's losing it.
I just got her next chess move.
She bid four spades.
Well, the reviews are finally in.
And according to the elementary school paper, the show was a big hit.
They have their own newspaper?
How cute.
Read it, Dorothy.
"I saw the play yesterday.
It was good.
"It was called Henny Penny.
The actors were good, especially Turkey Lurkey".
"And the others were good, too.
My friends and I all liked it".
See, Dorothy?
I knew my ending wouldn't hurt the play.
Oh, no, the show was a big success.
In fact the library's been busier than ever.
The kids are really getting excited about reading.
Where's Blanche?
She should see this review.
Oh, yes, and I hope it makes her feel better.
I've been worried about her.
Ever since she got those flowers from Mel Bushman, she hasn't been herself.
Well, I'm off to the Rusty Anchor.
Spring break comes but once a year.
