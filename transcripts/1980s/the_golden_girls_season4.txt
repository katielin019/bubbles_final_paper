{START OF EPISODE 1}
# Traveled down the road and back again # You would see Girls!
Girls, guess what.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute!
Why do you always say, "Girls, girls"?
Do you see Molly Ringwald sitting here?
You're awfully cranky today.
Well, forgive me.
My arthritis is bothering me, my social security check was late, and I realized today I haven't showered with a man in 22 years.
Ma, Pop's been dead 27 years.
What's your point?
- What are you saying?
- Isn't it obvious, Dorothy?
She showered with a dead man for five years.
Rose, what did you want?
I got two tickets to the hottest Norwegian musical in town.
Rose, you've really tempted me, but I have other plans.
- You have a date?
-  Never say that while I'm eating.
I'm teaching history for an adult-education program.
It's for people who never got high school diplomas.
- What else do they teach?
- The usual high school subjects.
You mean like the three Rs - reading, writing and rooster inseminating?
No, we just teach the first two Rs.
Fine.
But you'll be sending people out into the world who don't know you can get a nasty rooster bite if you don't warm your hands up first.
Girls, is this dress me?
It's too tight, it's too short and it shows too much cleavage for a woman your age.
Yes, Blanche, it's you.
- Another date with your mystery man?
- Oh, he's no mystery man.
Then how come you've been out with him four times, we know nothing about him?
- Well, there is one little thing -  - Hello?
-  Confused?
How could he possibly confuse this young, nubile body with that raisin in sneakers?
Well, there's only one way to settle this.
I'm going.
The hell you are!
I'm going.
Neither one of you is going.
Fidel isn't coming.
Where is he?
- We killed him.
- I know.
We might as well have put a gun to poor Fidel's head.
We were too much woman for him.
His spirit was willing, but his poor heart couldn't take it.
It's all our fault.
Our silly competitiveness did this.
Oh, come on, you two.
The man was in his seventies.
These things just happen.
You had nothing to do with his heart giving out.
Dorothy, everyone here is a woman.
We are gathered here today to honor the memory of a man who has suddenly been taken from us.
What are you looking at me for?
Just keep talking.
Fidel Santiago was a very special man.
He was kind, caring and loving.
He was a man who brought joy into the lives of all he touched.
I have the feeling he touched every behind in the room.
Fidel Santiago lived life Excuse me, Father.
Hold that thought.
Which of you was Fidel's girlfriend?
Oh!
My God, he had his burro hitched to every bedpost in town!
But that's good news, girls.
That means your cheap, animal-like lust didn't have anything to do with killing Fidel.
I'm leaving.
I'm not about to mourn a man who's been with every woman in this room.
He was never with me.
I guess even he had his standards.
Hold it.
Stay where you are.
Father, if you don't mind my saying so, I think you lost control of the room.
Excuse me.
The man in that box was a bum.
A scoundrel, a cheat and a liar.
- You got that right.
- Quiet.
I work alone.
But there was another side to him, and it was beautiful.
He awakened feelings in me I haven't felt in 35 years.
We used to hug and kiss and hold hands, and it was nice.
He made me feel attractive and desirable again.
He probably made the rest of you feel that way too.
And looking out at this kennel club, that was no small accomplishment.
You may all hate Fidel right now, but I know the next time I'm sitting in the park on a warm sunny day, and I smell the aroma of a cheap cigar I'll think of Fidel Santiago and I'll smile.
- Oh, Ma, that was very sweet.
- Just lovely, Sophia.
Sophia, can you ever forgive me for all those ugly things I said?
Of course.
It was said in the heat of battle.
You know, if I had it all to do over again, I'd let you have Fidel.
You're so generous!
The man's packing material, now you're letting me have him?
I have coat racks livelier than him!
She's giving him to me.
The man's face has more powder on it than Ann Miller's and she's giving him to me.
A piece of lumber would make a better dancing partner!
Thanks for niente!
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Don't you just love waking up with rain tapping on your bedroom window?
Absolutely.
I always throw open the window, uncork a bottle of Cold Duck and slip into my Frederick's of Hollywood ostrich-feather nightie.
Just because of rain tapping at your window?
Oh, I thought she said, "Wayne".
My mistake.
Sorry.
- Ma, where you going?
- To the market.
- Why are you going in the rain?
- The market's in Miami.
If it was in Phoenix, I'd be going in the sun.
Now, Sophia, Rose asked a perfectly sensible question.
Am I the only one she caught by surprise?
Rose, I'm gonna buy a nectarine.
I go to the market every day to buy a nectarine.
At 82, that's life - a round trip on the number 6 bus to buy a nectarine.
- That's so sad.
- Not sad.
Life.
Sad is when you have to mash the nectarine with a fork.
It's a shame Sophia has nothing constructive to do anymore.
She needs something to make her feel more fulfilled.
I'll tell you what would make her feel more fulfilled  Blanche!
A hobby.
Oh, I thought you meant, you know, a man.
You got a better hobby?
- I don't think a hobby is the answer for Ma.
- What do you think is?
I wish I knew.
Let's face it, life is as interesting as you make it, and at Ma's age it's harder to make the effort.
I should be grateful she's at least able to get out, even if it is just to buy a nectarine.
Well, girls, since it's raining, we could tackle those jobs around the house we always talk about.
- I'll change that bulb in the hallway.
- I'll hold the ladder.
I meant something like rearranging the furniture in the living room, or cleaning out the garage, or relining the kitchen shelves.
- Bingo!
- Oh, bingo's fun on a rainy day.
- She was talking about relining shelves.
- Well, that could be fun too, if we divide into teams and grease our hands.
I got arrested for that once at a party in Chattanooga.
Oh, my goodness.
Look what I found.
Double-fudge cookies.
I thought we agreed not to keep cookies in the house.
- Right, after this last box.
- You're not gonna eat them, are you?
No, Rose.
We're gonna go to some dumb country and try to use them as money.
- I thought we were gonna divide up work.
- That's right.
Rose, make a pot of coffee, Dorothy get the plates, and I'll just tear into these suckers.
- Hey!
Hey, you got any decent nectarines?
- There's nothing wrong with those.
Please!
I got a bowl of waxed bananas that'll be ripe before these are.
You're crazy.
This nectarine is beautiful.
I never saw a more perfect piece of fruit.
No?
Then try kissing my behind.
It's a real peach.
- Sophia.
- Nah, César Chàvez.
I got hungry.
- They giving you a hard time, too?
- No, I can't pick out a decent nectarine.
- This way they do it for me.
- Why don't you just ask for help?
Help?
You know who helps old broads like us?
Boy scouts in cartoons.
We gotta look after ourselves.
- They giving you any trouble?
- I can't get a refund on this lamb chop.
It looked fine in the case, but when I got it home the bottom was all fat.
- Come with me.
- Sophia, I don't wanna make trouble.
When's the last time you saw me make trouble?
- Aisle three.
- Oh, relax.
- Sir, uh - Ma'am, I'm sorry, but I already told you I can't take it back.
It's against store policy.
Are you willing to sign an affidavit?
- A what?
- An affidavit.
- It's standard in any NOPRL investigation.
- NOPRL?
The N-O-P-R- Network of Older People Retired but Living.
Sophia Petrillo, past president and legal counsel.
This store's in big trouble, mister.
I got a better case than Valerie Harper.
Excuse me, ladies.
Is there a problem here?
Only if you consider a class-action suit and a boycott by OREP a problem.
- I thought it was NOPRL.
- This is too big for NOPRL.
- This is all the way up to OREP.
- OREP?
Organization of Retired and Elderly People.
Sophia Petrillo, Executive Director and leader of the '87 march on Neiman Marcus.
Mrs. Petrillo, isn't there some way to resolve this matter?
I'm afraid not.
The wheels of justice are already in motion.
Of course, a full refund could put those wheels in reverse.
- How much?
- A buck, 17.
You got it.
Here.
Keep the change.
Thank you.
We'll be in touch.
Oh, listen.
Uh, how much for the nectarine?
- Take it.
It's on the house.
- We can't do that.
It's against the bylaws.
All right, you can pay me.
That's 45 cents.
What's inside, a pit or a pearl?
- This is a 25-cent nectarine.
- Fine.
Sold.
Don't stand there like a bump on a pickle.
Give the man a quarter.
When the waiter brought my order he set down a bowl of gazpacho in front of me.
I said, "I ordered consommé".
He said, "A hot number like you needs something spicy".
I said, "I'll give you somethin' spicy," and I poured the gazpacho down his pants.
- So you never went out with him.
- No.
I just slept with him.
He wasn't my type.
Oh, my goodness.
Blanche, how could you?
- Come on, Rose.
She's just teasing you.
- That's right, honey, I'm just teasing.
You always tease the one you love.
Actually, tease and tickle.
Actually, tease, tickle and spank.
Blanche - Actually - Blanche.
I'm sorry.
What was I talking about?
- About teasing me 'cause you love me.
- Oh, that's right.
Well, it's true.
I learned that during my sorority years when I was dating Preston Bougainvillea.
- Lord, the teasing that boy put up with.
- Because of his name.
No, because of his ears.
He had these long, floppy ears.
Kind of like a basset hound.
When he came to pick me up for our blind date I couldn't believe it.
He jumped out of the car and he ran up the walk and bounded up onto the front porch, and I remember thinking, "He's gonna trip on those ears".
But he didn't.
So there he stood before me introducing himself and, I don't know, I was still so stunned, I just kind of half-muttered a "Howdy-do" and he said, "I beg your pardon?
I didn't hear you".
Well, I don't know what came over me, but I just blurted out, "Didn't hear me?
I think you could pick up Radio Free Europe with those ears"!
And you know what he did?
He laughed.
Well, right then and there I started growing very fond of Mr. Preston Bougainvillea, and over the next several months we saw quite a lot of each other.
- Oh, that's really very sweet, Blanche.
- I know.
By the way, did you girls know that the size of a man's ears is directly proportionate to the size of his other bodily organs?
What do you mean?
He had a big, floppy pancreas, Rose.
Look, could we get back to lining the shelves?
- I don't feel like it anymore.
- What do you wanna do instead?
I know.
Let's rent an adult video, drink mimosas and French-kiss the pillows.
I don't think so, Blanche.
Fine.
I'm out of ideas.
You think of something.
How about if we rearrange the furniture in the living room?
Don't you think we ought to wait till Sophia gets back?
Maybe she'd like to help.
You know she's always exhausted when she gets back from the market.
The first thing she does is go to take a nap before dinner.
Then we'll just do it right now.
Come on.
OK.
- Well, I guess we should get back to work.
- Oh, I suppose so, but, you know, a big meal always makes me so sleepy.
Is that why you usually go right to bed after a date buys you dinner?
- Who said that?
- You did.
At the beauty parlor.
Don't you remember?
And Agnes said you were a lot of hot air, and you said she was just jealous 'cause she wasn't getting any.
And I said, "Getting any what"?
And you said, "Rice pudding, Rose".
- And I said - Can we get back to moving the furniture?
The weather's cleared up.
I think we should save a big project like this for a rainy day.
We agreed we weren't gonna waste time.
That'd be a mistake, something we'd regret for the rest of our lives.
Rose, we're eating pizza, not getting tattoos.
I just hate the idea of wasting time, I always have - ever since what happened to my neighbor in St. Olaf.
Rose are you about to educate us on the evils of wasting time by telling a long, tedious St. Olaf story?
D'you know a better way?
She has a point, Blanche.
It was back in 1955 and we had just moved into our first house, right next door to Pigpen Johannsen.
- It wasn't his real name.
It was a nickname.
- Pigpen?
No, Johannsen.
Anyway, Pigpen had just turned 80 and the town bylaws made him leave his job teaching drivers training at the high school.
- Well, at 80 it was about time.
- It had nothing to do with his age.
There was an old law on the books about driving with your shirt off.
I once got arrested for that in Chattanooga, too.
Blanche, let me ask you a question.
Are you allowed to go back to Chattanooga?
Are you kidding?
The sheriff still writes.
- Go on, Rose.
- Anyway, without a job Pigpen started feeling useless, so the town fathers thought they'd give him a new job - putting up the "Welcome to St. Olaf" sign out on Miller's Lane.
- Rose, is there a point to this story?
- Yes!
That same year on Founders' Day the governor was coming, and Pigpen forgot to put up the sign.
The governor drove straight through town without ever realizing he was in St. Olaf.
I would have thought the glazed look on everyone's face would have tipped him off.
So the point is Pigpen ruined Founders' Day all because he was wasting time.
That's right, and the town fathers took down his picture.
It had always hung in the St. Olaf auto shop, right next to Andy Granatelli.
My mother used to date him.
You know what he has under that trench coat?
A wrench?
That's what Mother called it.
Anyway, Mother was having trouble with her transmission and Andy was - It's after one o'clock.
You're late.
- So dock me.
- You do this for free.
- Then be grateful.
Anything happening?
Yeah, we got three in surgery, two in X-ray, and you gotta deliver these on your break.
In your dreams!
I'm a Sunshine Lady, not a teamster.
Now get the hell outta here, let me do my work.
Oh, uh, one more thing.
Your boyfriend was looking for you.
Sam?
He wheeled himself out here just to see me?
Yeah.
I don't get it.
He must see a side of you that's hidden from the rest of the world.
Like the dark side of the moon.
You're just jealous because you know you can never have me.
What's wrong, you don't watch General Hospital?
This place is a passion pit.
- Any flowers for me today?
- No.
- Are you sure?
The name's Leonard.
- I know your name.
You ask me every day if I have flowers for you, and the answer is always no.
Oh, wait a minute.
I made a mistake.
There are flowers for you today.
Really?
Which one?
All of them, and the balloons too.
There's no one here to deliver them right now, so you leave your walker here and just wheel these to your room.
Oh, thank you.
No!
Thank youl Hi, Sophia.
- Sam!
How are you doin'?
- I'm feeling real good today.
Your strength's coming back - you wheeled yourself down the hall.
Excuse me, I'd like to check on my husband.
Mr. Carp, prostate surgery.
Nothing yet, but he'll be fine.
I went through it myself 20 years ago.
- You had prostate surgery?
- What do I look like, a cross-dresser?
My husband had the surgery.
I was the one who went through it.
So, tell me, Sam, what's new?
So, anyway, Lars froze solid right in the middle of the lake and the town fathers mistook him for Max Brinker, the inventor of Herring Krispies.
Which, by the way, go great with borscht.
But what doesn't?
Yeah, I guess we are!
We're very tired.
We took care of a lot of odds and ends around the house today.
- What did you do, Ma?
- What did I do today?
What I do every day - I bought a nectarine.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
- Check.
- Check.
- I'll open for a quarter.
- I'm in.
I'll see your quarter and I'll raise you a quarter.
By the way, Rose, your shoe is untied.
I'm too smart for you, Sophia.
You won't distract me this time.
Besides, I'm wearing pumps.
- Your pump is untied.
- Oh, thanks.
Look!
Mr. Feinbaum's totally naked in his bedroom window!
That is the third time we caught you cheating.
Ma, you're out.
Hey, gimme a break!
When you're 80, you're allowed to cheat - just like you're allowed to take money out of your daughter's purse.
Oops!
Uh was that the phone?
Don't trouble yourselves.
I'll get it.
How did you know your mother was cheating?
Because Mr. Feinbaum never walks around totally naked.
He always wears a boy-scout neckerchief.
But never in the same place twice.
Which is why there's no Mrs. Feinbaum.
Deal.
Did you see that, Dorothy?
It was a UFO!
Rose, don't be ridiculous.
It was a plane.
Deal, come on.
Planes don't fly over residential neighborhoods.
Neither do UFOs.
They only fly over empty fields in Kentucky, where fat guys in overalls named Cooley have just run out of gas.
- I think we ought to call the authorities.
- Rose, there is no such thing as a UFO.
They were probably looking for someone to bring up to the ship.
Fine, you stay out here.
Flag them down if they fly by again.
- I'll go inside and pack a bag.
- But I wanna be the one to go.
Whose bag do you think I'm gonna pack?
- There's the bell.
That must be Ham at the door.
Come on, come on!
How do you do?
So, what exactly is "Ham" short for, Ham?
My guess would be ham and potatoes.
We'd better run along.
We don't want to be late.
- I'm sure you'll have a wonderful evening.
- It was very nice meeting all of you.
Same here.
I hope we get to see more of you.
Don't even bother.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Boy, he sure looks different from his picture.
Sometimes people can lose their looks.
Not in Sicily.
In Sicily, if you're born beautiful, you stay beautiful.
The whole town sees to it.
They check up on you, they encourage you, they never let you slip.
That's why we were so happy when Dorothy was born.
Oh, Ma.
Who needed all those people bothering us all the time!
- I'm going back outside, Dorothy.
- Fine, Rose.
Oh, Ham, you always did know how to make me laugh.
Nice to know I haven't lost it - all of it.
Now, don't you talk like that.
You haven't lost a thing.
Why, the way you can tell a story, the way you twirled me around that dance floor, you'd think it was 30 years ago.
Gosh, look at the time.
I'd better go.
Oh, baloney!
It's late now, in ten minutes it'll still be late.
You just sit yourself down right there.
Go on.
Thattaboy.
Ha ha ha.
- I had a nice time tonight, Blanche.
- You know, I did too.
And I wasn't sure I would, if you want the truth.
What?
Well, this may sound funny, but I kept thinking, "Here I am, so bald and so heavy.
"What if I show up and Blanche looks as pretty as she did 30 years ago"?
- But I don't.
- No, you don't.
What?
- You look prettier.
- Oh No, I mean it!
The face and the figure and that smile - it's all gotten better.
Unless it's my age making me see those things.
No!
I'm glad I looked you up, Blanche.
I haven't had this much fun in a long time.
- I guess I'd better get back to the hotel.
- Honey, are you sure you have to?
Blanche, are you asking me what I think you're asking me?
Think you might like some company tonight?
Maybe some other time, Blanche.
- What are you doing, Dorothy?
- Oh looking at the stars.
Pondering the universe.
I've been doing the same thing, thinking how wonderful it would be if there really were aliens.
Maybe it'd be just like Cocoon.
and they'd take us away and we'd never grow old.
See, I don't know.
I like my life.
I mean, I'm not president or anything.
I'm just a teacher.
A substitute teacher.
A divorced substitute teacher, who can't even afford her own place to live.
Beam me up!
"Beam me up"?
Dorothy, you believe?
Rose, they checked out what we saw, and it actually was a UFO.
Where are you going?
We might miss the aliens.
That would be fine with me.
Dorothy, why are you talking that way?
I think it's wonderful that there are other beings out there trying to meet us.
They might have solutions to all our problems, cures for our diseases, new story lines for ALF.
They might also have tentacles on their legs so that they can suck all the blood out of our heads!
I'm sorry, Rose.
I'm sorry.
Part of me is very excited, but part of me is petrified.
I cannot relax with this.
Unfortunately, I'm going to have to because Major Barker does not want us to say a word about this to anyone until we hear from him again.
Not a word.
Is that understood?
Yes.
I thought I heard voices.
What you girls doing?
Oh, nothing.
We're just sitting talking.
Not talking about anything special.
The subject of aliens never came up.
Well, I can give you something to talk about - my date tonight.
Which turned out to be the most humiliating evening I've ever spent.
- So, what are we talking about?
- Blanche's date.
He turned me down, again.
I'm just devastated.
Blanche, you said yourself you didn't find him that attractive anymore.
That's not the point.
The point is, to Blanche Devereaux, sexuality and attractiveness are very important - they are Blanche Devereaux.
It just tortures me to know that there's one man out there, one on the face of God's green earth, that I cannot have.
Especially if he's fat and bald!
- Blanche, forget about it.
- I can't forget about it.
There's only one thing for me to do.
I'm going to call him up, and tomorrow I'm going out with that man again.
I don't care what amount of seducing it takes, but as God is my witness, I am not returning to this house until he has begged, beseeched and pleaded with me to go to bed with him.
You know, that was the original ending to Gone with the Wind.
- That was a terrific meal.
Thanks again.
- You're welcome.
I just figured you deserved it before going back to that high-tension, dog-eat-dog pressure pit you work in.
Blanche, I run a miniature golf course.
- Your champagne, Ms. Devereaux.
- Thank you.
You will forgive me if this champagne has a little effect on me, Ham.
Sometimes just having it setting on the table sets my heart to racing.
Oh!
Feel.
Lower.
It's like there's some kind of wild animal energy in there, pounding pounding and burning, yearning and lusting, just crying out to be released.
I've never said this to another man, but I feel a heat between us, kind of a flame crackling and hissing.
I want you to put that flame out, Ham.
I want you to pluck me like a fruit, and wash me off in your kisses, and sink your teeth into my ripe, juicy flesh.
Let me make you happy, Ham.
All I need to know is that you want me as much as I want you.
Maybe some other time, Blanche.
That does it!
I will not let you humiliate me any longer.
You may not want me, Ham Lushbough, but I can promise you somewhere on this planet I will find some man who does!
- Hi, girls.
- How'd it go?
Perfectly.
When Blanche Devereaux sets out to seduce a man she doesn't drag her feet.
- Blanche - Ham Lushbough, you sex-hungry devil!
I told you, no more.
Go home and take a cold shower.
No.
Not until you know the reason why I keep telling you I can't sleep with you.
Ma, listen, maybe watching some TV in another room might be a good idea.
Fine, Dorothy, but keep the volume down.
Ma!
It's all right.
It's already out in the open anyway.
Come on in and say your piece.
Well, the reason is, we've been getting along so well as friends lately that I didn't want us to have another night like that night we had in college.
In college?
What are you talking about?
That night - the spring jamboree out at Grady's Motor Lodge?
- I never went to Grady's with you.
- Sure you did.
I'll never forget it.
You had your hair in braids, you wore a pink bathrobe - Pink, with a little lace trim?
- Yes.
- And matching slippers?
- Yes.
Ham!
That wasn't me, that was my sister Virginia.
You're ki That was Virginia?
How could I forget that?
That was the worst night I've ever spent in bed with a woman in my life!
Wait a minute, Ham.
Are you saying the only reason you've kept turning me down is 'cause of the bad time you had that night?
Yes.
Oh, well, Blanche, this changes everything.
Does all that stuff you said in the restaurant still go?
I don't think so, Ham.
The moment has passed.
We could never recapture it.
Blanche, that was just 20 minutes ago.
I'm sorry, Ham, but you were just a plaything in my game of sexual conquest.
- I was gonna use you.
- Use me, use me.
Good-bye, Ham.
If you leave now, we can still have our memories.
I'll trade all my memories for a quickie.
Beat it, tubbo.
I wonder what would happen if somebody called my sister Virginia and told her this terribly embarrassing story.
I guess there's only one way to find out.
I'm exhausted.
I'm going to bed.
Are you coming, Ma?
In a minute.
I gotta finish this article.
I love these military guys.
First they fly this top-secret bomber jet way off course.
Next they start denying it ever happened - like nobody ever saw it flying over downtown Miami.
- Rose.
- Hi, Dorothy.
Rose, there's something we have to talk about.
There was an article in today's paper.
The one about the UFO being a secret bomber?
- I'm sorry, Rose.
- Sorry for what?
Just because that one bomber wasn't a UFO doesn't mean we should stop watching for others.
Does it?
Oh.
I guess there isn't much point in sitting out here anymore, is there?
I don't know, Rose.
It's such a nice night.
- Let's stay awhile.
- OK.
You know something, Dorothy?
You don't have to tell me this if you don't want to, but underneath it all you believe in them, don't you?
You did from the very beginning.
I'm glad.
It's more fun.
It's like with Santa Claus.
The best Christmas we ever had was when all eight of my brothers and sisters, from Lily to Michael, all still believed.
That must be ten years ago now.
Dorothy!
Dorothy?
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Why do they schedule the charity softball game on the hottest day of the year?
I know it.
I'm all hot and sweaty, I'm short of breath and I'm physically exhausted.
You'd think I had a good time.
You didn't have fun?
Only thing I really enjoyed was stealing second base.
When have you not enjoyed sliding under a man in uniform?
It's hotter in here than it is outside.
Oh, no.
Of all days for the air conditioner to break down.
We'd better call the repairman.
- His number's in the kitchen.
- So is the ice cream.
We can have some while we're waiting.
- Ma, what are you doing?
- I'm giving the leftover meat loaf a thrill.
What do you think?
It's hot as hell.
Close it before the food spoils.
OK.
I meant the refrigerator.
I'm gonna call the repairman.
I already did.
He said he'd be over in 15 minutes.
That was three hours ago.
Well, let's break out the ice cream.
- What's this?
- I froze my underwear to stay cool.
I'd lend you a pair, but on you I'm afraid they'd melt too fast.
I don't believe it.
This is incredible news.
I've been nominated for St. Olaf woman of the year.
That's nice.
Did the new TV Guide come yet?
Blanche, you don't understand.
In St. Olaf this is the highest honor there is.
I never dreamed that someone as unqualified as I am would ever be nominated for anything so important.
I guess Dan Quayle really opened the floodgates.
Last year Gretchen Lillehammer won for running into the burning library and saving all the books.
That is amazing.
How'd she do that?
She took two books in one hand and one in the other and ran like the dickens.
Your library only has three books?
What happens when a person's read them all?
I guess we'll cross that bridge when we get to it.
Oh, this is so exciting.
Let me get us some refreshments before we start.
Make yourselves comfortable.
Sorry it's hot.
And here we are in the middle of a heat wave with no air conditioning.
Not necessarily.
If Rose wins, you'll be flown to St. Olaf to attend the ceremony.
Well, this year I was planning to watch it on TV.
You know, if all goes well with this here interview, you can start packing right away.
Oh, I don't think I'd bother Rose with an old interview.
You'd just embarrass her.
She's so modest.
I'm sorry, but we must conduct face-to-face interviews with all the candidates.
Here we are.
I made some nice, hot cocoa.
Now, Rose, tell us how you got up the courage to save that eagle.
It was just a bird.
- What about saving that there school bus?
- I just gave it directions.
There was a bridge washed out on the road ahead.
Really?
Wait a minute.
I can't take credit for those things.
Rose, please.
Gentlemen, you're embarrassing her.
I mean, the woman is a saint.
And she's far too modest to take credit for any of her good deeds.
So what do you say?
Do we have a winner here or not?
Rose Nylund, you are St. Olaf's woman of the year.
Ladies and gentlemen.
the fasten-your-seatbelts sign is now off.
If anyone knows how to fix it.
please report to the flight attendant.
I don't get it.
Why did we get off that jetliner in Minneapolis and switch to this rickety old thing?
Because the jets are too big to land at St. Gustave.
St. Gustave?
I thought we were flying to St. Olaf.
St. Olaf doesn't have an airport.
The only way you can get to St. Olaf is to fly to St. Gustave and then take land transportation to St. Olaf.
Even the birds do it that way when they migrate.
I don't believe this.
Could be worse.
We could be going to Beaver Falls.
Beaver Falls?
That's my stop.
I just can't believe we're on our way to St. Olaf.
Oh, I'm so excited.
You girls are gonna love it.
But I guess everybody thinks his home town is pretty special.
I do.
I'll never forget when I went back after many years, it was just as I remembered.
Garbage in the street, prostitutes in the doorways, a couple of guys hanging from their heels in the town square I can't go on.
Got a handkerchief?
Honey, why are you getting all teary?
Sicily sounds just awful.
That wasn't Sicily.
That was my first apartment in Brooklyn.
Well, I'll tell you, the best part of this whole thing is sharing the most important moment of your life with your best friends.
We're just happy to be with you when you get your little plaque.
Oh, Blanche, it's more than a plaque.
In St. Olaf it's the highest honor.
We all think of it as a reminder that no matter how bad things may be in the rest of the world, St. Olaf is still a place that's filled with honest people leading honest lives.
Well, we're just really proud of you, Rose.
I'm sure, Rose, that there is nobody who deserves that award more than you do.
This is the captain speaking.
We are about to begin our descent to St. Gustave airport.
At least I think it's the airport.
Wow, in 20 minutes we'll be in St. Gustave.
Then we'll hop on a train for Zumbro Falls and we'll grab the shuttle.
By my estimation we should be in St. Olaf in a couple of days.
Rose, listen.
It's about your biography, honey.
There's something in there that Well, what is the word I'm looking for?
I don't know exactly how to say this.
Wait a minute.
Where's Ma?
Oh, my God, no.
The curse of the Zumbro Falls tunnel.
- Sophia!
- Ma!
-  What?
- Ma, where are you?
Are you all right?
I am now.
I can't believe this is the shuttle to St. Olaf.
- How you doing up there, Ma?
- Fine.
Sophia, why don't you want to sit back here with us?
Because after three days on the road with you guys, this jackass smells better.
Thank you.
Look at that beautiful sky.
That's one of the most wonderful things about being here.
- It is beautiful.
- It looks like you could reach those stars.
I can't tell you how many people in St. Olaf have fallen off their roofs trying.
Rose, are we anywhere near St. Olaf?
We're getting close.
Look, there's the old tree house.
Gee, when I was a kid my best friend Ingrid and I used to go up there all the time.
Oh, gosh, I miss her.
I haven't talked to her in ages.
Why don't you give her a call?
- Maybe I will.
- Sure.
Hey, Ingrid!
Is that you, Rose?
Well, how are you?
Fine, Ingrid!
How are you?
Hello!
Oh, Dr. Harry Weston, and I'm not dressed, thank God.
- Hi, neighbors.
Welcome home.
-  Hi, Dreyfuss.
Hi, Harry.
What brings you here today?
You called and told me you were here.
Remember you asked me to save your mail for you?
Oh, yes.
So I did.
Thank you, Harry.
You're just about the sweetest thing in my whole zip code.
I don't know why I haven't had you over to dinner.
Well, that would be real nice, yeah.
I've also been meaning to talk to you about an examination.
Blanche, I'm a pediatrician.
Harry, I'm not sick.
Well, now I really have to go and so does Dreyfuss.
That's why we're taking a walk - because we both really need to go.
That's not what I mean.
I mean I'll be walking, Dreyfuss will be going.
- See you all.
Come on, Dreyfuss.
- (all Bye, Harry.
Boy, I know the prescription for me.
One of him every four hours.
Is this for me?
- It's from St. Olaf.
- Blanche.
What was all that stuff with Harry?
You know, the man has not dated since his wife died.
You can't spend your whole life in mourning, especially when you're the most eligible bachelor in town.
In Sicily we have a simple rule.
If your husband dies, you wait 20 years or until you grow a mustache.
Blanche, we all had an agreement.
No one dates Harry until an appropriate amount of time has passed.
I know.
18 months.
I have it marked on my calendar with a big, red circle.
As of today, that man is in play.
I'm just amazed I was able to wait so long.
He is so sophisticated and charming and rich and handsome.
He fairly screams Blanche.
At least he will before I'm through with him.
Girls, look.
It's the St. Olaf woman-of-the-year trophy.
It says here I won woman of the year after all because I embody the values of truth and honesty for which the award stands.
What happened to Emma Immerhoffer?
She was disqualified.
They found a skeleton in her closet.
- What was it?
- Mr. Immerhoffer.
This thing isn't solid gold, is it?
Oh, no.
You just peel off the gold foil and it's pure milk chocolate.
Oh, that's the loveliest trophy I've ever seen.
I'm gonna get a knife.
Rose, there is no way that we can tell you how proud of you we are.
There is.
Congratulations, Rose Nylund.
You are St. Olaf's woman of the year.
(all Oofda!
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Hi, Ma.
What you doing?
Just looking through the old photo album.
- Boy, you were a cute kid.
- Yeah, I was sorta cute.
- Look, there I am at seven.
- An angel.
- Here I am at 11.
- Adorable.
Oh Look, here I am at 15.
The beginning of the end.
- Hi.
- How did the auditions go?
Great!
You should've tried out, Dorothy.
Everybody was really stinky - you might have gotten a part this year.
Don't be silly.
Dorothy couldn't get a part.
We're doing the award-winning musical Cats.
You have to be agile, graceful and sensual.
You're right, Blanche.
How could I possibly compete with you?
You've given some of your finest performances in back alleys.
Dorothy Zbornak, I resent that remark.
Have you been talking to Ed Tyler?
That man has such a big mouth!
Which reminds me, I wanna go give him a call.
Oh, God, she's really a character!
She's also a cheap slut.
Stanley, these these seats are pretty far from the field.
Yeah.
Dorothy, baseball was meant to be seen from the bleachers, in small, intimate parks with real grass.
If there's anything I hate, it's artificial turf.
That never stopped you from growing it on your head.
Sophia, I'm having too much fun to be bothered by your insults.
- Are you comfy, babe?
- Yeah.
This must be my lucky day.
I usually end up sitting next to a fat, sweaty man who insists on taking his shirt off.
What kept you?
- You want a hot dog, babe?
- No, thanks.
- How about a sun visor?
- No.
- You want a nice cushion for your chair?
- How about cutting the crap, Stanley?
Why are we here, and what is it you want from me?
I was gonna wait until we'd sung "Take Me Out To The Ballgame" but I'll tell you now.
I'm having a little business problem.
- What's the problem?
- I'm bankrupt.
Dorothy, I just need a few bucks until the end of the month.
- Come on, Ma, we're leaving.
- Wait.
I gotta see at least one man bat.
-  Calm down!
Calm down.
What's wrong?
These two drive me crazy.
They drink milk off the floor, scratch the furniture, and this one just coughed up a fur ball!
- That was not a fur ball, it was - Rose, who cares what it was!
Now, quit driving Ma crazy.
Dorothy, our director said to prepare for our roles we must become cats.
That's why I've been playing with your ball of yarn and Blanche has been making screeching sounds in her room at night.
You've been practicing for this part for a lifetime, haven't you, Blanche?
Ma, listen.
The doctor said you are supposed to be in bed.
- Oh, I'm fine.
-  Down here, paralyzed.
What?
!
Sophia!
Honey!
Oh, dear!
Ma, I insist on taking you back to the hospital.
- I don't want to go to the hospital.
- You ought to at least see a doctor.
- Doctor's coming.
- What doctor?
- He's a friend of mine.
- We're going to the hospital.
This guy is good.
He's probably the most learned, respected neurologist in Florida.
How'd you ever meet a man like that?
We were judges at a wet T-shirt contest.
- I'm calling the hospital.
- No, Dorothy, stop.
I really feel like this is all my fault.
That's why I'm getting him - he's the best.
- And I'm gonna pay for him.
- You, paying for something?
!
- What are you saying, I'm cheap?
- Of course she is.
You're the only man I know who owns a timeshare dog.
Ma, I'm taking you to the hospital.
No, I want Stan's doctor.
I trust this sweet man.
- Mom - "Sweet"?
!
- Ma, you hate Stan.
- Not anymore.
Now I love him.
Love, love, love, love this man.
Oh, Ma!
Now, what the hell is going on?
Let me tell you something I've never told a soul.
When I was unconscious, hovering between life and death, I began a journey toward a great white light.
Along the way were all the people who went before me.
I saw my parents.
I saw your father.
I saw the Ritz Brothers.
Believe me, they're much funnier dead.
As I was about to enter the light, a voice boomed, "Before you can enter the gates of heaven, "you must patch things up with your ex-son-in-law Stan".
You see, babe?
It's all part of the big guy's master plan.
I am but a humble servant.
Mr. Belvedere is a humble servant, Stanley.
You're a horse's ass.
- How're you feeling, Ma?
- No improvement.
I'm sorry.
By the way, you're wearing your knee brace on your neck.
I know Ma is faking.
She is not really paralyzed.
It's only natural for you to feel that way.
At the counseling center we learn that the first reaction to catastrophe is denial.
- Rose, I am not in denial.
- Yes, you are.
You're just denying you're in denial.
Rose, I am not denying that I am in denial.
If you're not denying you're in denial, then you're in denial.
Look, fluffhead!
Why should I deny being in denial when I never said I was in denial?
You are the one who said I was in denial, and don't you deny it!
Listen, Dorothy, I think your mother's faking, too.
But what if she isn't?
Just try putting yourself in her position.
Do you know how much it hurts to have someone you love not trust you?
- I sure do.
- Rose, I was about to tell a story.
- I wanna tell one.
- Dorothy?
Boy, this is a no-win situation.
- But go ahead, Blanche.
- Fine.
You may never get to hear my story.
Then I'm wrong.
It isn't a no-win situation.
I was still in high school at the time and I was having an affair with a very handsome exchange student named Jean-Pierre Fontainebleau.
I think he was French or something.
He was always sneering and he wore a beret.
We weren't allowed to wear berets in high school.
It was against the St. Olaf dress code.
They did let me wear a paper cap a lot.
It was long and pointy.
More a cone shape than a beret.
Anyway, Jean-Pierre must have known about my reputation for playing the field, because from the beginning he was convinced I couldn't be faithful.
He would spy on me in my classes, he'd follow me home from school.
Some nights he would even shimmy up the oak tree outside my bedroom door, hoping to catch me in the act.
What act?
Second act of My Fair Lady.
Rose.
Finally, I had to tell him I couldn't take it anymore, and we broke up.
I was completely crushed.
I guess you really liked him.
No, I really liked the American boy he was rooming with, Bobby-Joe Nugent.
We'd been having an affair for months in the one place Jean-Pierre never looked!
The Eiffel Tower.
Actually, it was in the cutaway Oldsmobile that they kept in the Drivers Ed department at school.
Oh, lordy, the things I did in that car!
It's a good thing old St. Christopher had his back to me.
- There's no doubt about it, she's faking.
- Uh-uh.
I didn't learn to do that till I was married.
I meant Ma, Blanche!
And I'm gonna go prove it right now.
Hiya, Ma.
How're you doing?
Oh!
Oh!
Oh, Ma, I feel dizzy!
Oh, there's a pain going up my arm!
My chest!
Ma!
-  Stanley Stanley, don't worry.
I'm 82 years old.
My bones are brittle.
My muscles are atrophied.
My circulation is worse than US News & World Report.
There's no physical they can give that Sophia Petrillo can't fail.
Ma, I'll go tell the nurse you're here.
- That's a lovely chair.
- Oh, thank you.
I'd give anything for an electric wheelchair.
I don't have the strength to push this like I used to.
That's too bad.
If things go well, I'll give you this chair in a couple of weeks.
Oh I wish I had your positive attitude.
The doctors told me it'd be a waste of time.
Doctors!
What do they know?
They spend years in medical school, they still don't know enough to warm their hands before they do a breast exam.
Unfortunately, they do know I'll never walk again.
Oh.
- Stan, did you hear that?
- Yeah.
Terrible.
You got any gum on you?
Stan!
These poor people.
How can we take advantage of this situation?
Sophia, we've come this far.
Just think about the money.
Think about it so hard that you block out everything else.
Especially him.
Hi, I'm Timmy.
What's your name?
None of your business.
Leave her alone.
Ma, the nurse wants to know if you'd mind if this little boy goes ahead of you.
No problem.
Oh, no.
You need to see a doctor just as much as me.
I'll wait my turn.
No, kid.
It's your turn.
I don't need to see a doctor.
- You were right, Dorothy.
I was faking.
- Sophia, I'm shocked.
Dorothy, I had no idea.
I used to think you were the scum of the earth.
I have just downgraded my opinion!
What I did was wrong.
I feel humiliated in the presence of you courageous people.
I offer you my heartfelt sympathies.
Well, what do you say, everybody?
Shall we forgive her?
-  Help!
Help!
Let me in!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Rose is in trouble.
It took two guys to pry him off the Steinbergs' plastic flamingos.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Girls!
Girls, it's here.
I am so excited.
It's my letter from the Elvis Presley fan club.
Oh, my hands are shaking.
Dorothy, you read it.
"Dear Rose Nylund.
Your application to start an unauthorized chapter "of the Elvis Presley Hunk-a Hunk-a Burnin' Love Fan Club in your neighborhood and/or trailer park has been accepted".
This is the happiest, most fulfilling day of my life!
Which makes you the most pathetic human being on this planet.
Well, I love Elvis.
Blanche, I'd be honored if you'd be the first member of the Hunk-a Hunk-a Burnin' Love Fan Club.
I graciously accept, and promise to do a good job as president.
Why should you be president?
Well, because I saw Elvis in Harum Scarum over 50 times.
- So did I. - I have every album he ever recorded.
So have I. And every single.
I slept with him in a Motel 6 outside Chattanooga.
Congratulations, Madam President.
Blanche, why did you say that?
You didn't really sleep with Elvis Presley.
Back where I come from, there were a lot of hillbilly boys with muttonchop sideburns named Elvis.
The light was bad in the bayou.
It could have happened.
Blanche, you never slept with Elvis Presley.
Oh, all right, all right.
But I once did make love to an unattractive boy named Ernest, and in the middle of it I cried out Elvis' name.
Technically, I think that counts.
Ma, what's the matter?
Esther Weinstock is dead.
We grew up together.
She was my best friend.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
What happened?
She was fighting an oil rig fire in the Gulf of Mexico.
She was 88!
Well, it's great that she was able to work right up to the end.
- When is the funeral?
- Wednesday.
- I'll go back to Brooklyn with you.
- I'm not going, and you know why.
I guess the body was lost at sea.
Ma doesn't want to go to the funeral because Esther's husband Max Weinstock will be there.
I will not stand under the same roof with that miserable bocciagalupe.
and you know why.
See, years ago, Max and my father were business partners.
They ran a pizza-knish stand at Coney Island.
One day, Pop came home and said that Max had gambled away the profits.
Well, they went broke.
Ma never forgave him.
Max and my Salvadore were business partners - They already know, Ma.
- Oh, that's what I figured.
I got my heel caught in the carpet.
Sophia, she was your best friend.
Are you sure you don't want to go to her funeral?
Of course I want to go.
But I swore a Sicilian oath I would never cast my eyes on Max Weinstock again.
And nothing you say will make me change my mind.
- I'll buy the tickets.
- Book business class.
If I have to sit through the Three Amigos.
I'll need champagne.
All right, Dorothy.
Let's get out of here.
Ma, we have to pay our respects to the family.
And listen, if you see Max, I don't want you making another scene like at the funeral.
Scene?
What scene?
It's not my fault the klutz tripped over my foot and nearly fell into an open grave.
You didn't have to yell, "Start shoveling, boys" as he tried to get up.
Sophia?
Dorothy, do you hear a dog howling?
Behave yourself.
Hello, Mr. Weinstock.
Oh, my goodness, as I live and breathe!
Unfortunately.
- Little Dorothy Petrillo.
- That's right.
You haven't changed a bit.
Same gorgeous smile.
Pretty eyes, beautiful figure, long golden blonde hair.
You have cataracts, don't you, Mr. Weinstock?
Since 1967.
Let's go.
Sophia.
Esther would have appreciated you being here.
I loved that woman.
She was the best.
That's why she deserved a better husband.
Instead of a miserable, no-good, lowlife sleazeball.
Sophia, if you knew now what I knew then Ah, so what.
If you've got something to say, spit it out.
Don't push me, or I will.
There.
I pushed.
Too bad you weren't on the stairs.
Ma, Ma, you're creating a scene.
Look, that was a long time ago.
Forget about it.
I can't forget.
This man stole money from us.
- Because of him, our family went hungry.
- Ma, we never went hungry.
Some nights I felt like dessert.
Sophia, I kept this secret for 40 years because I didn't want to break your heart.
But now that I know it's made of stone, you might as well know the truth.
Brooklyn, 1949.
We were sitting at this table, playing a spirited game of Gin!
Four in a row.
Tonight's your lucky night.
I hope that'll continue once we get home.
He buys a new T-shirt, trims the hair out of his ears, suddenly he's Charles Boyer.
- So how was business today?
- Terrific.
We didn't have a pizza or a knish left on the shelf.
- I'd love a cup of coffee.
- I'll get everybody some.
Here, let me help.
- Max, there's something I have to tell you.
- What's wrong?
The week's receipts.
I lost them on a horse.
You what?
I got a tip.
It was supposed to be a sure thing.
I don't believe it!
That means we're out of business.
We're through.
So's my marriage.
When Sophia finds out, she'll put me out on the street.
Max, I'm sorry.
Coffee'll be ready in a minute.
Sophia, I have something to tell you.
Wait, wait.
Let me tell her.
Sophia, we're out of business.
I gambled the money away.
- That's not true.
- I wish it wasn't.
That's what happened.
I'm sorry, Sophia.
- I don't believe it!
This is insane.
- Calm down.
Calm down?
Calm down?
Did you hear what he just said?
Salvadore wanted to tell you, but I wouldn't let him.
I cared for you both too much to let your marriage break up.
And Sal felt so guilty, he never gambled again.
It was worth it.
That was a very lovely thing you did, Mr. Weinstock.
Wasn't it, Ma?
Wasn't it, Ma?
Ah, forget it.
It's ancient history.
Ma, say something to him.
I can't.
Sicilians have a hard time with apologies.
They also have a hard time passing wet cement without putting someone in it.
They manage.
Go on.
Max, there's something I gotta say to you.
What?
The knishes.
They're pretty good.
Apology accepted.
Well, that concludes the first meeting of the Hunk-a Hunk-a Burnin' Love Fan Club.
But before we adjourn, our secretary has a real special surprise.
A genuine Elvis artifact!
It's a partially-eaten pork chop.
- Let me see.
- He had beautiful teeth, didn't he?
It's wonderful!
This has to be a fake.
Elvis would never have left this much meat on a pork chop.
Dorothy, you're out of the club.
Meeting is adjourned.
Thank you, ladies.
See you next week.
Thank you for coming.
I hope you're not too upset over this, Dorothy.
I've just been thrown out of an unauthorized Elvis fan club.
I'll try to pick up the pieces and go on with my life.
I mean, there must be a support group for people like me.
We're sorry, Dorothy, but the bylaws clearly state that any derogatory remarks about the King are grounds for immediate expulsion.
Maybe you ought to join an organization that is a little less fanatical in its devotion.
Like what, Blanche?
The PLO?
Do you know what I hate doing most after a party?
Trying to find your underwear in the big pile?
Cleaning up the dirty dishes.
You twit.
Listen, why don't we just leave this mess and go out and get something to eat?
I'll ask Ma if she'd like to come.
It'll do her good to get out of the house.
Oh, she's been so depressed since that funeral.
I mean, she lost one of her oldest friends, and even though she made up with Max, she'll probably never see him again.
Well, you go and get her, we will try to cheer her up.
We don't want that poor thing getting sick.
No.
-  Ma!
Oh, my God!
- Dorothy, what is it?
What, honey?
Oh!
Good Lord.
Ma, what is going on here?
Afterglow.
Nice to see you again, Dorothy.
You too, Mr. Weinstock.
When did you get in?
Oh, you mean in town?
Yesterday.
You should have called, I could have made you dinner.
- Before you slept with my mother!
- Dorothy!
Ma, this is the most upsetting thing you have ever done.
I am shocked.
I am disappointed.
I am speechless.
- We're getting married.
- I am very lightheaded.
Dorothy?
Dorothy?
- Oh, good, I think she's waking up.
- Oh, honey, come on, sweetie.
Are you all right?
Oh, I'm fine, Rose.
Oh, that was strange.
I I've never fainted before.
Me neither.
What does it feel like after you faint?
Like this, Rose.
Ma, I think it's time you explained all this nonsense about getting married.
- It's not nonsense.
- And we're gonna do it right away.
Look, Dorothy, I know that you'll probably find it hard to understand.
But when I saw your mother again after all these years, something happened.
We talked, we laughed, we held hands, we fell in love.
Actually, we got a hot dog before we fell in love.
But the point is, we're crazy about each other.
And if this turns out to be a mistake, what the hell, we'll probably be dead before we find out.
Kiss me, you poet.
- Oh, they are so cute together!
- Oh, I know.
Isn't it romantic?
No, it isn't, it's ridiculous.
Ma, this is the biggest mistake you have ever made in your life.
Fine.
Don't come to the wedding.
Who wants you?
But just remember one thing.
If you want to send us a gift, we're registered at Jordan Marsh.
- What are you doing?
- Sending invitations for the wedding.
Oh, well, forget about that, Rose.
Do you know what we need?
An Elvis impersonator.
Sounds great.
I thought we'd get a new dishwasher first, but this could probably come in just as handy.
I mean for our next club meeting, Rose.
Membership has been waning.
Maybe this will generate a little interest.
- Oh, Blanche, that's a terrific idea.
- What's a terrific idea?
Hiring an Elvis impersonator for our next club meeting.
If you were picking an Elvis impersonator, how would you pick a good one?
I'd thump on his belly and see if he's ripe.
How the hell should I know?
Why the hell should I care?
You threw me out of your crummy club.
I'll start working on it as soon as I finish with the invitations for you-know-who's wedding.
Look, Rose, I would rather not talk about Ma's wedding.
Dorothy, don't you think it's time you gave her your blessing?
We've hired a caterer, we've ordered flowers.
The invitations are being sent.
Blanche, how can I give her my blessing?
She has hated that man for 40 years.
Now suddenly, after a three-day weekend, she decides to get married.
I cannot believe that someone can fall in love that quickly.
My Charlie asked me to marry him ten minutes after we met.
Course, we were only seven at the time.
My mother was so cute when I told her.
She said, "Rose, honey, you're just a little girl.
"You have your entire life before you, and the whole world to see.
"Now, you wait until you grow up and get sophisticated, and marry at 15 like your sisters".
But you didn't.
No, I was always kind of the gypsy of the family.
The rebel.
I wanted to see the world.
So after high school, I went to St. Gustave University to study Latin.
I didn't know you studied Latin.
First in my class, Orothyday.
Well, what do you think?
- Sophia, that looks beautiful.
- It's absolutely gorgeous.
Don't you have to be a virgin to wear a white wedding dress?
Please!
The last time I was a virgin, the Louisiana Purchase was still in escrow.
- It doesn't matter.
No one's gonna see it.
- What do you mean?
According to Sicilian custom, I can't marry unless I have you-know-who's blessing.
- Who?
- Dick Clark!
Dorothy, you idiot.
Dorothy, your mother's talking to you.
Dorothy, I spoke to your Aunt Regina in Sicily to tell her about the wedding.
She told me I'm in for some very bad luck unless I have the blessing of my eldest daughter, or my child with the most facial hair.
Either way, all arrows point to you.
Ma, you know how I feel.
I cannot give you my blessing.
Dorothy, I love you, but if you ruin my happiness, I will put a Sicilian curse on you that will be like hell on earth.
Ma, you can't put a Sicilian curse on your eldest daughter if the mother is marrying a man under five foot, seven!
You're not the only one with Aunt Regina's phone number.
Damn MCI.
Sophia?
Sophia?
Sophia?
Where'd she go?
The wedding's about to start.
- Is that you, Sophia?
-  No, it's Merlin Olsen.
I'm watering my forget-me-not bouquet.
- Honey, we've come to help you get ready.
- The wedding is off.
What's going on?
Where's Sophia?
She's locked herself in the bathroom.
She has pre-wedding jitters.
Sophia?
It's me, Max.
Now, what's all this nonsense about not wanting to get married?
Oh, Max, I love you with all my heart.
The time we spent together has been some of the happiest of my life.
But my Dorothy might be right.
Maybe it's not possible to fall in love so quickly.
Maybe it's not possible at all at our age.
But it sure felt like it the other night, when we were walking along the beach, and you took me in your arms and said, "Sophia, look up at that beautiful moon.
I wish I could throw a lasso around it and give it to you.
That's how much I love you".
- And then I said, "Darling" - Ma, stop.
Stop.
- Ma, listen, I have to talk to you.
- Who's in charge here?
- What's the problem?
- I'm the caterer.
It's two o'clock.
The guests are waiting.
Why isn't the show on the road?
- Ma, I know you're in there.
- The wedding is off.
- She doesn't approve.
- She doesn't approve?
Now, look here, Stretch.
I have a hundred cheese puffs and a sensitive assistant both on the verge of collapse.
Whatever the problem is, overlook it.
My mother did with my marriage.
And if you say something smart, I'll slap you silly.
Listen, this is a private moment, so butt out, Rambo.
Ma, I have a confession to make.
I came here to beg you for the last time not to get married.
I didn't want you and Max together because it looked like cheating on Pop.
I know it doesn't make any sense, but I still think of the two of you as being married.
I didn't want Max taking Pop's place.
But now that I see the two of you so much in love, I realize I was just being selfish, Ma.
Ma, I want you to be happy.
And I know Pop would too.
I love you, pussycat.
This is more moving than Susan Hayward's climactic speech in I Want To Livel You're ready to fly right out of here, aren't you?
Well, excuse me for living, Anita Bryant.
Could we please get married already, so I can get in on the hugging?
- Places!
- Oh, Sophia.
Honey, I want to wish you all the happiness in the world.
Oh, thank you, Blanche.
And Sophia, I want to offer you a traditional Scandinavian wedding blessing.
Keflectoflafen flafenflurfen.
potetaflingin faflafen.
I'm really touched.
I'm also soaking wet.
All right!
One group hug, and let's hit the road.
Oh, Sophia, honey  On the last episode of "The Golden Girls" Good Lord.
Ma, what is going on here?
Afterglow.
Ma, this is the most upsetting thing you have ever done.
I am shocked.
I am disappointed.
I am speechless.
We're getting married.
I now pronounce you man and wife.
You may kiss the bride.
Oh!
- Call 911!
- Call 911!
- Call 911!
911!
- Call 911!
- It's 911.
- I got it.
- Fire department, quick.
- Blanche All right, wait.
Hello, fire department?
This is Blanche Devereaux at 5161 Richm Oh!
Well, of course you know where it is.
Hi, Ed.
I'm on fire.
Why, you naughty boy!
Blanche I'll bet that's why Chicago burnt down.
Mrs. O'Leary was probably a tramp, too.
Give me that.
Look, I'm terribly sorry.
There's been a mistake.
There is no fire here.
That's right, this isn't Blanche.
So that remark about the fire hose was totally wasted.
- I set off the smoke alarm.
- How?
Cigarette.
Oh, no thank you, I don't smoke.
Now, how did you set off the alarm?
I smoked a cigarette, you amoeba.
I'm sorry, Rose, I'm sorry.
I'm just so upset that I started smoking again.
- Well, why did you start again?
- I don't know.
I don't know.
I've just been under a lot of stress lately.
My job, Ma getting married You're growing older, you don't go out much, your chin is starting to droop.
Since I've already had the cigarette, why don't you just blindfold me and shoot me?
Hello!
Honeymoon's over.
We're back.
Don't let Ma know I have been smoking.
She will kill me.
Ma!
Dorothy!
- What was that for?
- You've been smoking.
- I have not.
- Then you've been smoking.
- No, I haven't.
- Ma, it was me.
That's for lying.
Dorothy, you quit 15 years ago.
You told me you'd never smoke again.
I know, Ma, I'm sorry.
Oh You know, I quit once, I can quit again.
Hi, everybody.
It's me, Max, the blushing groom.
Well, how was the honeymoon?
I tell you, that Disney World hotel was just wonderful.
It had everything.
Good service, delicious food, a beautiful room.
What did you think of the rides?
They got rides?
Don't worry about it.
You had a good time and you never had to stand in line.
We'd like to stay and chat, but we want to get settled in our new place.
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.
Come back soon.
Oh, aren't they cute?
- We forgot something.
- We forgot to get a new place.
- You're kidding?
- Don't worry.
We just need a roof over our heads for a couple of days while we look.
Doesn't have to be anything fancy.
- Girls?
- Would you all like to stay here with us?
Here?
Gee, that didn't even cross my mind.
- What do you think, Max?
- Well, there's no pool All right, we'll stay - but only for a couple of days.
Get the bags, pumpkin.
He likes to eat breakfast in his underwear.
I hope that's not a problem for anyone.
- I need a cigarette.
- No, Dorothy!
You sit right down here.
Now, you need to exercise a little self-control.
Dorothy, listen.
You can quit smoking.
Now, just do it the way I did it, just taper off - smoke only after sex.
Good idea.
One pack'll last her a lifetime.
Dorothy?
Out in a minute, Ma.
Hiya, cupcake.
It's time to play connect the freckles.
Not now, Max.
Would you hand me the Aagh!
What the hell is going on here?
Aagh!
- Aagh!
- Aagh!
Quiet, quiet, quiet!
This has been a big mistake.
I thought Sophia was in the shower.
Hand me my glasses.
I'm blind as a bat without 'em.
Aagh!
Shut up, Max.
Blanche, hand me my robe.
Here you are.
Now, listen.
We love you two a lot, but you've been here for three weeks, and this arrangement is not working out.
I guess we forgot how hard it is to live with a man in the house.
- Why?
What did I do?
- Well, you snore.
You don't pick up after yourself.
You never remember to lift the toilet seat.
Please!
He hardly ever remembers to lift up the toilet lid.
Fine, fine.
We'll start looking for a place today.
Come on, Max.
So what did you think of the apartment?
Too many old people.
All those hearing aids interfere with the cable TV.
- You want a Life Saver?
- What kind you got?
- Peppermint.
- I don't like peppermint.
Got butterscotch?
Does it say 7-Eleven across my forehead?
- I got peppermint.
- I'll try one.
I like butterscotch better.
- What is this?
Coconut?
- Peppermint!
Don't yell, I heard you the first time.
- It's nice to sit here at the beach.
- Yeah.
Beach is nice.
Always was.
- My Sal used to like the beach.
- Tell me about it.
That's why he wanted to open a pizza-knish stand on the boardwalk in Coney Island.
Now, there was a million-dollar idea.
A million dollars was a bargain for that idea.
That business was Sal's dream.
Too bad it didn't work out.
Yeah, bad timing.
Hey!
Hey, hey.
Hey, you're driving away the birds with that noise.
- You know a real song?
- Do you have a buck?
"It Had To Be You".
That was Sal's favorite song.
-  - ?
It had to be you # It had to be you # I wandered around, and finally found Speaking of found, look what I found.
Butterscotch.
Doesn't get much better than this.
Oh, it is such a beautiful day!
It sure is.
What are you gonna do today, Dorothy?
Sit in a dark room and smoke ten packs of cigarettes.
Dorothy, I know what you're going through.
I smoked for years.
You smoked?
Rose, that's like finding out Lassie was an alcoholic.
Lassie was an alcoholic?
!
That explains why she always tipped to one side when she waved goodbye to Timmy.
Hi, everybody!
We've got some great news.
We found a place.
It's absolutely perfect.
It's near the beach, it's reasonably priced, and it's just the right size.
- Ma, that's great.
- We can't wait to show it to you.
Well?
What do you think?
Ma, this is a run-down old concession stand.
- You can't live here.
- We're not living here.
We leased it.
It took every dime we had, but it's a dream come true.
- I don't understand.
- You should have that printed on a T-shirt.
We're opening the old business.
A million-dollar idea deserves a second chance.
Ma, come on.
You're both over 80.
Starting a business is hard work.
Yeah, for amateurs.
But we've already done this before.
By the way, we'll be staying with you until the business gets off the ground.
Well, what happens if the business fails?
We'll have to talk about a night-light for the bathroom.
Max.
Put the paintbrush down a minute.
Taste this pizza.
I want an absolutely honest opinion.
- I'm dying.
- Yeah?
- It's gorgeous.
- Yeah?
Perfection!
Like velvet in my mouth.
A masterpiece!
A Picasso with mozzarella.
A Rembrandt with tomato sauce.
- I thought it needed more salt.
- And garlic.
It's a little flat.
Oh, wow!
Look at this.
- Why, the place is really coming along.
- Boy, I'll say it is.
I have to give you two credit.
It looks like it's really gonna happen.
Why shouldn't it happen?
I know the pizza business like the back of my hand.
I never noticed that before.
What do you think it would cost to remove that?
Let's talk about it at home.
It's getting late.
Let's go.
- We have a few more hours of work here.
- Aw, Ma, you're overdoing it.
- We're fine.
- Besides, we want our grand opening in time for the big beach festival this weekend.
Sophia, it's getting damp and chilly out here.
You're gonna catch yourself a cold.
Please!
I haven't had a cold in 40 years.
This is the worst cold I've had in 40 years.
My back is killing me.
I feel dizzy and nauseous.
Every joint in my body feels like it's on fire.
- Boy, you really caught a nasty bug.
- Please!
I'm 84 years old.
I feel like this every day.
Never fear, Doctor Rose is here.
I made you both an old-fashioned St. Olaf tonic.
Guaranteed to get you back on your feet and put hair on your chest.
That's the one nasty side effect they could never figure out.
I'm feeling better.
I think I'll go check the stand.
The big beach festival is this weekend.
We have to be open.
If we don't make some money, we'll lose our lease.
Max, it is out of the question.
She's right.
We're too sick.
The dream has ended.
It's over.
It's a dirty rotten shame we couldn't find somebody who could find it in their heart to help this absolutely adorable old couple fulfill their dream of a lifetime.
Oh, all right, all right.
We will.
You?
- Do you have any experience?
- No.
You're hired.
Boy, making pizza really brings back a flood of childhood memories.
Make a lot of pizza as a kid?
No.
My favorite uncle, Uncle Gunther, used to sprinkle Parmesan cheese on his hair.
Why would he do that?
He said it was the perfect compliment to the croutons he'd taped to his eyebrows.
He had a Caesar complex.
Salad, not Julius.
Rose, maybe you ought to work on the knishes.
Or did you have an uncle who was a Mr. Potato Head?
Dorothy, you're just cranky 'cause you haven't had a cigarette in a while.
Maybe a little.
But I'll tell you the truth, I think I'm over the worst.
That's great.
I'm really proud of you.
You'd think you'd miss that feeling you get with that first puff, that feeling of relaxation when you hold it in, and then the sheer exhilaration as you exhale slowly.
No, not really.
I've found other ways to ease my tensions.
Honey, would you hand me that large saucepan?
- Oh, sure.
- No, the one behind it, the really big one.
You know, you really have to give Max and Sophia credit.
This business was their dream, and they're going after it.
- I wish I'd done that with my dream.
- Fine.
- Honey, would you check on the pizzas?
- Why don't you want to hear my dream?
Because it is always the same thing with you, Blanche.
Sex, sex, sex.
I am tired of hearing it.
Maybe that's because you're not getting any, Dorothy.
Do you want the pot again, Rose?
Well, it just so happens that it was not about sex.
There's a lot more than that to Blanche Devereaux.
My dream was to be a great scientist.
Work in a laboratory.
Do research.
Find a cure for the common cold.
You know, Blanche, I owe you an apology.
I thought Then I'd knock all those test tubes off the table, grab a Ph.D., and show those lab rabbits how it's really done.
It's gonna be a long afternoon.
This is so depressing.
We haven't had a customer in two hours.
Well, that's because we need promotion.
You know, Blanche is right.
It doesn't matter how good your product is, you have to know how to promote it.
That sure was the case with Fritz Vanderhoeven, who owned the St. Olaf Motor Coach Company.
- They built a car in St. Olaf?
- They sure did.
The Vanderhoeven Rocket.
Oh, it was a beauty.
Fritz really had vision.
Actually, he had double vision, which is why it had eight tires.
So, uh What happened?
It never got off the ground.
Bad promotion.
Which was a shame, because it's the first car to this day that ran on free fuel.
It was totally powered by cow manure.
I think a lot of people were turned off by the ad - a cow sitting on a gas tank, reading the Farmers'Almanac.
- How's it going?
- Ma, what are you doing here?
I feel better and I wanted to get some air.
How's business?
We've only had two customers all day.
I think it's such a nice hot day, they're all in the water.
That's your problem?
You can't get the people out of the water?
Amateurs.
Let me show you how you run a pizza-knish stand at the beach.
- Shark!
Shark!
Shark!
-  Now they're out of the water, start selling.
- Uh, pizza.
- Step right up.
And after Ma got everybody out of the water, people started trying our food.
Before we knew it, there wasn't a pizza or a knish left on the shelf.
- The place is a hit.
- Sophia, I am very proud of you.
Not only did you save the business, but you saved all those people from the shark.
Don't look so worried.
I handle the books.
Hello?
What?
- Oh, no No, we'll be right there.
- What's the matter?
- I don't understand it.
- How could the stand burn to the ground?
- I don't know.
- We were so careful.
I have a confession to make.
The reason I sent you two ahead and said I'd lock up is because I wanted a cigarette.
And I guess I didn't put it out.
- Oh - Well, I wouldn't worry.
How much harm can it do?
The place already burnt down.
Rose, you dummy, she means her cigarette started the fire.
Max, Ma, I have never felt so bad in my entire life.
I don't know what to say.
It was an accident, pussycat.
Don't worry about it.
- That's it?
That's all you have to say?
- Uh-huh.
Oh, Ma, please yell at me.
Please scream at me.
Please make me feel guilty.
I mean, if you don't say anything, I'll feel twice as bad.
I know.
I'm not an amateur at this.
We finally found the cause of the fire.
Take me away.
Cuff me.
Well, I'd like to take you to dinner first.
Then we could play the rest by ear.
But business before pleasure.
Your fire was caused by a faulty coil in the pizza oven.
I'll write up a report for your insurance company.
But this is wonderful news!
Dorothy, it wasn't your fault.
And with the insurance money, Max and Sophia can build again, bigger and better than ever.
From these ashes a phoenix will rise!
Stronger, healthier, more vibrant, more successful than before.
Eh.
Why did you say "Ah"?
- It just came out.
- Me too.
Did you have fun rebuilding the old business?
Ah It always felt like something was missing.
I can tell you what that was.
My Salvadore.
And my Esther.
Sophia, I think we got a problem here.
Is there anything we can do, Sophia?
Go get two cheesecakes and wait up for me.
I have a feeling the four of us will be talking till dawn.
Max, do you love me?
Sure.
You?
I love you.
Are you in love with me?
What is this?
The Oprah Winfrey Show?
You know what I mean.
Are you in love with me the way you were with Esther?
- No.
Do you love me the way you did Sal?
- I thought I did.
But now I think I might have confused a great friendship with a great love.
Boy, if this was Ronald Colman and Greer Garson, there wouldn't be a dry eye in the house.
This is the kind of mistake you make when you're 19.
It gives me hope to think you can be just as dopey at 82.
So.
Do you want to get a divorce?
Hey, I'm Catholic.
I don't need a divorce on my record with St. Peter in spitting distance.
I say we get separated.
Fine.
That's a better idea.
I'll go back to Brooklyn.
My family's there, my grandkids.
And I miss the old neighborhood.
And I'll stay here in Miami.
Ever since I lost my Sal, the ladies I live with are my family.
But that doesn't mean we can't get together occasionally for You know.
You can do that when you're just friends?
Hey, I want to get in good with St. Peter, I don't want his job.
You know, me and Esther, and you and Salvadore, we were all good together.
The best.
Hey, Mister.
You want me to play "It Had To Be You," for the two of you?
I want you to play it for the four of us.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Girls!
Girls, it's here.
I am so excited.
It's my letter from the Elvis Presley fan club.
Oh, my hands are shaking.
Dorothy, you read it.
"Dear Rose Nylund.
Your application to start an unauthorized chapter "of the Elvis Presley Hunk-a Hunk-a Burnin' Love Fan Club in your neighborhood and/or trailer park has been accepted".
This is the happiest, most fulfilling day of my life!
Which makes you the most pathetic human being on this planet.
Well, I love Elvis.
Blanche, I'd be honored if you'd be the first member of the Hunk-a Hunk-a Burnin' Love Fan Club.
I graciously accept, and promise to do a good job as president.
Why should you be president?
Well, because I saw Elvis in Harum Scarum over 50 times.
- So did I. - I have every album he ever recorded.
So have I. And every single.
I slept with him in a Motel 6 outside Chattanooga.
Congratulations, Madam President.
Blanche, why did you say that?
You didn't really sleep with Elvis Presley.
Back where I come from, there were a lot of hillbilly boys with muttonchop sideburns named Elvis.
The light was bad in the bayou.
It could have happened.
Blanche, you never slept with Elvis Presley.
Oh, all right, all right.
But I once did make love to an unattractive boy named Ernest, and in the middle of it I cried out Elvis' name.
Technically, I think that counts.
Ma, what's the matter?
Esther Weinstock is dead.
We grew up together.
She was my best friend.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
What happened?
She was fighting an oil rig fire in the Gulf of Mexico.
She was 88!
Well, it's great that she was able to work right up to the end.
- When is the funeral?
- Wednesday.
- I'll go back to Brooklyn with you.
- I'm not going, and you know why.
I guess the body was lost at sea.
Ma doesn't want to go to the funeral because Esther's husband Max Weinstock will be there.
I will not stand under the same roof with that miserable bocciagalupe.
and you know why.
See, years ago, Max and my father were business partners.
They ran a pizza-knish stand at Coney Island.
One day, Pop came home and said that Max had gambled away the profits.
Well, they went broke.
Ma never forgave him.
Max and my Salvadore were business partners - They already know, Ma.
- Oh, that's what I figured.
I got my heel caught in the carpet.
Sophia, she was your best friend.
Are you sure you don't want to go to her funeral?
Of course I want to go.
But I swore a Sicilian oath I would never cast my eyes on Max Weinstock again.
And nothing you say will make me change my mind.
- I'll buy the tickets.
- Book business class.
If I have to sit through the Three Amigos.
I'll need champagne.
All right, Dorothy.
Let's get out of here.
Ma, we have to pay our respects to the family.
And listen, if you see Max, I don't want you making another scene like at the funeral.
Scene?
What scene?
It's not my fault the klutz tripped over my foot and nearly fell into an open grave.
You didn't have to yell, "Start shoveling, boys" as he tried to get up.
Sophia?
Dorothy, do you hear a dog howling?
Behave yourself.
Hello, Mr. Weinstock.
Oh, my goodness, as I live and breathe!
Unfortunately.
- Little Dorothy Petrillo.
- That's right.
You haven't changed a bit.
Same gorgeous smile.
Pretty eyes, beautiful figure, long golden blonde hair.
You have cataracts, don't you, Mr. Weinstock?
Since 1967.
Let's go.
Sophia.
Esther would have appreciated you being here.
I loved that woman.
She was the best.
That's why she deserved a better husband.
Instead of a miserable, no-good, lowlife sleazeball.
Sophia, if you knew now what I knew then Ah, so what.
If you've got something to say, spit it out.
Don't push me, or I will.
There.
I pushed.
Too bad you weren't on the stairs.
Ma, Ma, you're creating a scene.
Look, that was a long time ago.
Forget about it.
I can't forget.
This man stole money from us.
- Because of him, our family went hungry.
- Ma, we never went hungry.
Some nights I felt like dessert.
Sophia, I kept this secret for 40 years because I didn't want to break your heart.
But now that I know it's made of stone, you might as well know the truth.
Brooklyn, 1949.
We were sitting at this table, playing a spirited game of Gin!
Four in a row.
Tonight's your lucky night.
I hope that'll continue once we get home.
He buys a new T-shirt, trims the hair out of his ears, suddenly he's Charles Boyer.
- So how was business today?
- Terrific.
We didn't have a pizza or a knish left on the shelf.
- I'd love a cup of coffee.
- I'll get everybody some.
Here, let me help.
- Max, there's something I have to tell you.
- What's wrong?
The week's receipts.
I lost them on a horse.
You what?
I got a tip.
It was supposed to be a sure thing.
I don't believe it!
That means we're out of business.
We're through.
So's my marriage.
When Sophia finds out, she'll put me out on the street.
Max, I'm sorry.
Coffee'll be ready in a minute.
Sophia, I have something to tell you.
Wait, wait.
Let me tell her.
Sophia, we're out of business.
I gambled the money away.
- That's not true.
- I wish it wasn't.
That's what happened.
I'm sorry, Sophia.
- I don't believe it!
This is insane.
- Calm down.
Calm down?
Calm down?
Did you hear what he just said?
Salvadore wanted to tell you, but I wouldn't let him.
I cared for you both too much to let your marriage break up.
And Sal felt so guilty, he never gambled again.
It was worth it.
That was a very lovely thing you did, Mr. Weinstock.
Wasn't it, Ma?
Wasn't it, Ma?
Ah, forget it.
It's ancient history.
Ma, say something to him.
I can't.
Sicilians have a hard time with apologies.
They also have a hard time passing wet cement without putting someone in it.
They manage.
Go on.
Max, there's something I gotta say to you.
What?
The knishes.
They're pretty good.
Apology accepted.
Well, that concludes the first meeting of the Hunk-a Hunk-a Burnin' Love Fan Club.
But before we adjourn, our secretary has a real special surprise.
A genuine Elvis artifact!
It's a partially-eaten pork chop.
- Let me see.
- He had beautiful teeth, didn't he?
It's wonderful!
This has to be a fake.
Elvis would never have left this much meat on a pork chop.
Dorothy, you're out of the club.
Meeting is adjourned.
Thank you, ladies.
See you next week.
Thank you for coming.
I hope you're not too upset over this, Dorothy.
I've just been thrown out of an unauthorized Elvis fan club.
I'll try to pick up the pieces and go on with my life.
I mean, there must be a support group for people like me.
We're sorry, Dorothy, but the bylaws clearly state that any derogatory remarks about the King are grounds for immediate expulsion.
Maybe you ought to join an organization that is a little less fanatical in its devotion.
Like what, Blanche?
The PLO?
Do you know what I hate doing most after a party?
Trying to find your underwear in the big pile?
Cleaning up the dirty dishes.
You twit.
Listen, why don't we just leave this mess and go out and get something to eat?
I'll ask Ma if she'd like to come.
It'll do her good to get out of the house.
Oh, she's been so depressed since that funeral.
I mean, she lost one of her oldest friends, and even though she made up with Max, she'll probably never see him again.
Well, you go and get her, we will try to cheer her up.
We don't want that poor thing getting sick.
No.
-  Ma!
Oh, my God!
- Dorothy, what is it?
What, honey?
Oh!
Good Lord.
Ma, what is going on here?
Afterglow.
Nice to see you again, Dorothy.
You too, Mr. Weinstock.
When did you get in?
Oh, you mean in town?
Yesterday.
You should have called, I could have made you dinner.
- Before you slept with my mother!
- Dorothy!
Ma, this is the most upsetting thing you have ever done.
I am shocked.
I am disappointed.
I am speechless.
- We're getting married.
- I am very lightheaded.
Dorothy?
Dorothy?
- Oh, good, I think she's waking up.
- Oh, honey, come on, sweetie.
Are you all right?
Oh, I'm fine, Rose.
Oh, that was strange.
I I've never fainted before.
Me neither.
What does it feel like after you faint?
Like this, Rose.
Ma, I think it's time you explained all this nonsense about getting married.
- It's not nonsense.
- And we're gonna do it right away.
Look, Dorothy, I know that you'll probably find it hard to understand.
But when I saw your mother again after all these years, something happened.
We talked, we laughed, we held hands, we fell in love.
Actually, we got a hot dog before we fell in love.
But the point is, we're crazy about each other.
And if this turns out to be a mistake, what the hell, we'll probably be dead before we find out.
Kiss me, you poet.
- Oh, they are so cute together!
- Oh, I know.
Isn't it romantic?
No, it isn't, it's ridiculous.
Ma, this is the biggest mistake you have ever made in your life.
Fine.
Don't come to the wedding.
Who wants you?
But just remember one thing.
If you want to send us a gift, we're registered at Jordan Marsh.
- What are you doing?
- Sending invitations for the wedding.
Oh, well, forget about that, Rose.
Do you know what we need?
An Elvis impersonator.
Sounds great.
I thought we'd get a new dishwasher first, but this could probably come in just as handy.
I mean for our next club meeting, Rose.
Membership has been waning.
Maybe this will generate a little interest.
- Oh, Blanche, that's a terrific idea.
- What's a terrific idea?
Hiring an Elvis impersonator for our next club meeting.
If you were picking an Elvis impersonator, how would you pick a good one?
I'd thump on his belly and see if he's ripe.
How the hell should I know?
Why the hell should I care?
You threw me out of your crummy club.
I'll start working on it as soon as I finish with the invitations for you-know-who's wedding.
Look, Rose, I would rather not talk about Ma's wedding.
Dorothy, don't you think it's time you gave her your blessing?
We've hired a caterer, we've ordered flowers.
The invitations are being sent.
Blanche, how can I give her my blessing?
She has hated that man for 40 years.
Now suddenly, after a three-day weekend, she decides to get married.
I cannot believe that someone can fall in love that quickly.
My Charlie asked me to marry him ten minutes after we met.
Course, we were only seven at the time.
My mother was so cute when I told her.
She said, "Rose, honey, you're just a little girl.
"You have your entire life before you, and the whole world to see.
"Now, you wait until you grow up and get sophisticated, and marry at 15 like your sisters".
But you didn't.
No, I was always kind of the gypsy of the family.
The rebel.
I wanted to see the world.
So after high school, I went to St. Gustave University to study Latin.
I didn't know you studied Latin.
First in my class, Orothyday.
Well, what do you think?
- Sophia, that looks beautiful.
- It's absolutely gorgeous.
Don't you have to be a virgin to wear a white wedding dress?
Please!
The last time I was a virgin, the Louisiana Purchase was still in escrow.
- It doesn't matter.
No one's gonna see it.
- What do you mean?
According to Sicilian custom, I can't marry unless I have you-know-who's blessing.
- Who?
- Dick Clark!
Dorothy, you idiot.
Dorothy, your mother's talking to you.
Dorothy, I spoke to your Aunt Regina in Sicily to tell her about the wedding.
She told me I'm in for some very bad luck unless I have the blessing of my eldest daughter, or my child with the most facial hair.
Either way, all arrows point to you.
Ma, you know how I feel.
I cannot give you my blessing.
Dorothy, I love you, but if you ruin my happiness, I will put a Sicilian curse on you that will be like hell on earth.
Ma, you can't put a Sicilian curse on your eldest daughter if the mother is marrying a man under five foot, seven!
You're not the only one with Aunt Regina's phone number.
Damn MCI.
Sophia?
Sophia?
Sophia?
Where'd she go?
The wedding's about to start.
- Is that you, Sophia?
-  No, it's Merlin Olsen.
I'm watering my forget-me-not bouquet.
- Honey, we've come to help you get ready.
- The wedding is off.
What's going on?
Where's Sophia?
She's locked herself in the bathroom.
She has pre-wedding jitters.
Sophia?
It's me, Max.
Now, what's all this nonsense about not wanting to get married?
Oh, Max, I love you with all my heart.
The time we spent together has been some of the happiest of my life.
But my Dorothy might be right.
Maybe it's not possible to fall in love so quickly.
Maybe it's not possible at all at our age.
But it sure felt like it the other night, when we were walking along the beach, and you took me in your arms and said, "Sophia, look up at that beautiful moon.
I wish I could throw a lasso around it and give it to you.
That's how much I love you".
- And then I said, "Darling" - Ma, stop.
Stop.
- Ma, listen, I have to talk to you.
- Who's in charge here?
- What's the problem?
- I'm the caterer.
It's two o'clock.
The guests are waiting.
Why isn't the show on the road?
- Ma, I know you're in there.
- The wedding is off.
- She doesn't approve.
- She doesn't approve?
Now, look here, Stretch.
I have a hundred cheese puffs and a sensitive assistant both on the verge of collapse.
Whatever the problem is, overlook it.
My mother did with my marriage.
And if you say something smart, I'll slap you silly.
Listen, this is a private moment, so butt out, Rambo.
Ma, I have a confession to make.
I came here to beg you for the last time not to get married.
I didn't want you and Max together because it looked like cheating on Pop.
I know it doesn't make any sense, but I still think of the two of you as being married.
I didn't want Max taking Pop's place.
But now that I see the two of you so much in love, I realize I was just being selfish, Ma.
Ma, I want you to be happy.
And I know Pop would too.
I love you, pussycat.
This is more moving than Susan Hayward's climactic speech in I Want To Livel You're ready to fly right out of here, aren't you?
Well, excuse me for living, Anita Bryant.
Could we please get married already, so I can get in on the hugging?
- Places!
- Oh, Sophia.
Honey, I want to wish you all the happiness in the world.
Oh, thank you, Blanche.
And Sophia, I want to offer you a traditional Scandinavian wedding blessing.
Keflectoflafen flafenflurfen.
potetaflingin faflafen.
I'm really touched.
I'm also soaking wet.
All right!
One group hug, and let's hit the road.
Oh, Sophia, honey  On the last episode of "The Golden Girls" Good Lord.
Ma, what is going on here?
Afterglow.
Ma, this is the most upsetting thing you have ever done.
I am shocked.
I am disappointed.
I am speechless.
We're getting married.
I now pronounce you man and wife.
You may kiss the bride.
Oh!
- Call 911!
- Call 911!
- Call 911!
911!
- Call 911!
- It's 911.
- I got it.
- Fire department, quick.
- Blanche All right, wait.
Hello, fire department?
This is Blanche Devereaux at 5161 Richm Oh!
Well, of course you know where it is.
Hi, Ed.
I'm on fire.
Why, you naughty boy!
Blanche I'll bet that's why Chicago burnt down.
Mrs. O'Leary was probably a tramp, too.
Give me that.
Look, I'm terribly sorry.
There's been a mistake.
There is no fire here.
That's right, this isn't Blanche.
So that remark about the fire hose was totally wasted.
- I set off the smoke alarm.
- How?
Cigarette.
Oh, no thank you, I don't smoke.
Now, how did you set off the alarm?
I smoked a cigarette, you amoeba.
I'm sorry, Rose, I'm sorry.
I'm just so upset that I started smoking again.
- Well, why did you start again?
- I don't know.
I don't know.
I've just been under a lot of stress lately.
My job, Ma getting married You're growing older, you don't go out much, your chin is starting to droop.
Since I've already had the cigarette, why don't you just blindfold me and shoot me?
Hello!
Honeymoon's over.
We're back.
Don't let Ma know I have been smoking.
She will kill me.
Ma!
Dorothy!
- What was that for?
- You've been smoking.
- I have not.
- Then you've been smoking.
- No, I haven't.
- Ma, it was me.
That's for lying.
Dorothy, you quit 15 years ago.
You told me you'd never smoke again.
I know, Ma, I'm sorry.
Oh You know, I quit once, I can quit again.
Hi, everybody.
It's me, Max, the blushing groom.
Well, how was the honeymoon?
I tell you, that Disney World hotel was just wonderful.
It had everything.
Good service, delicious food, a beautiful room.
What did you think of the rides?
They got rides?
Don't worry about it.
You had a good time and you never had to stand in line.
We'd like to stay and chat, but we want to get settled in our new place.
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.
Come back soon.
Oh, aren't they cute?
- We forgot something.
- We forgot to get a new place.
- You're kidding?
- Don't worry.
We just need a roof over our heads for a couple of days while we look.
Doesn't have to be anything fancy.
- Girls?
- Would you all like to stay here with us?
Here?
Gee, that didn't even cross my mind.
- What do you think, Max?
- Well, there's no pool All right, we'll stay - but only for a couple of days.
Get the bags, pumpkin.
He likes to eat breakfast in his underwear.
I hope that's not a problem for anyone.
- I need a cigarette.
- No, Dorothy!
You sit right down here.
Now, you need to exercise a little self-control.
Dorothy, listen.
You can quit smoking.
Now, just do it the way I did it, just taper off - smoke only after sex.
Good idea.
One pack'll last her a lifetime.
Dorothy?
Out in a minute, Ma.
Hiya, cupcake.
It's time to play connect the freckles.
Not now, Max.
Would you hand me the Aagh!
What the hell is going on here?
Aagh!
- Aagh!
- Aagh!
Quiet, quiet, quiet!
This has been a big mistake.
I thought Sophia was in the shower.
Hand me my glasses.
I'm blind as a bat without 'em.
Aagh!
Shut up, Max.
Blanche, hand me my robe.
Here you are.
Now, listen.
We love you two a lot, but you've been here for three weeks, and this arrangement is not working out.
I guess we forgot how hard it is to live with a man in the house.
- Why?
What did I do?
- Well, you snore.
You don't pick up after yourself.
You never remember to lift the toilet seat.
Please!
He hardly ever remembers to lift up the toilet lid.
Fine, fine.
We'll start looking for a place today.
Come on, Max.
So what did you think of the apartment?
Too many old people.
All those hearing aids interfere with the cable TV.
- You want a Life Saver?
- What kind you got?
- Peppermint.
- I don't like peppermint.
Got butterscotch?
Does it say 7-Eleven across my forehead?
- I got peppermint.
- I'll try one.
I like butterscotch better.
- What is this?
Coconut?
- Peppermint!
Don't yell, I heard you the first time.
- It's nice to sit here at the beach.
- Yeah.
Beach is nice.
Always was.
- My Sal used to like the beach.
- Tell me about it.
That's why he wanted to open a pizza-knish stand on the boardwalk in Coney Island.
Now, there was a million-dollar idea.
A million dollars was a bargain for that idea.
That business was Sal's dream.
Too bad it didn't work out.
Yeah, bad timing.
Hey!
Hey, hey.
Hey, you're driving away the birds with that noise.
- You know a real song?
- Do you have a buck?
"It Had To Be You".
That was Sal's favorite song.
-  - ?
It had to be you # It had to be you # I wandered around, and finally found Speaking of found, look what I found.
Butterscotch.
Doesn't get much better than this.
Oh, it is such a beautiful day!
It sure is.
What are you gonna do today, Dorothy?
Sit in a dark room and smoke ten packs of cigarettes.
Dorothy, I know what you're going through.
I smoked for years.
You smoked?
Rose, that's like finding out Lassie was an alcoholic.
Lassie was an alcoholic?
!
That explains why she always tipped to one side when she waved goodbye to Timmy.
Hi, everybody!
We've got some great news.
We found a place.
It's absolutely perfect.
It's near the beach, it's reasonably priced, and it's just the right size.
- Ma, that's great.
- We can't wait to show it to you.
Well?
What do you think?
Ma, this is a run-down old concession stand.
- You can't live here.
- We're not living here.
We leased it.
It took every dime we had, but it's a dream come true.
- I don't understand.
- You should have that printed on a T-shirt.
We're opening the old business.
A million-dollar idea deserves a second chance.
Ma, come on.
You're both over 80.
Starting a business is hard work.
Yeah, for amateurs.
But we've already done this before.
By the way, we'll be staying with you until the business gets off the ground.
Well, what happens if the business fails?
We'll have to talk about a night-light for the bathroom.
Max.
Put the paintbrush down a minute.
Taste this pizza.
I want an absolutely honest opinion.
- I'm dying.
- Yeah?
- It's gorgeous.
- Yeah?
Perfection!
Like velvet in my mouth.
A masterpiece!
A Picasso with mozzarella.
A Rembrandt with tomato sauce.
- I thought it needed more salt.
- And garlic.
It's a little flat.
Oh, wow!
Look at this.
- Why, the place is really coming along.
- Boy, I'll say it is.
I have to give you two credit.
It looks like it's really gonna happen.
Why shouldn't it happen?
I know the pizza business like the back of my hand.
I never noticed that before.
What do you think it would cost to remove that?
Let's talk about it at home.
It's getting late.
Let's go.
- We have a few more hours of work here.
- Aw, Ma, you're overdoing it.
- We're fine.
- Besides, we want our grand opening in time for the big beach festival this weekend.
Sophia, it's getting damp and chilly out here.
You're gonna catch yourself a cold.
Please!
I haven't had a cold in 40 years.
This is the worst cold I've had in 40 years.
My back is killing me.
I feel dizzy and nauseous.
Every joint in my body feels like it's on fire.
- Boy, you really caught a nasty bug.
- Please!
I'm 84 years old.
I feel like this every day.
Never fear, Doctor Rose is here.
I made you both an old-fashioned St. Olaf tonic.
Guaranteed to get you back on your feet and put hair on your chest.
That's the one nasty side effect they could never figure out.
I'm feeling better.
I think I'll go check the stand.
The big beach festival is this weekend.
We have to be open.
If we don't make some money, we'll lose our lease.
Max, it is out of the question.
She's right.
We're too sick.
The dream has ended.
It's over.
It's a dirty rotten shame we couldn't find somebody who could find it in their heart to help this absolutely adorable old couple fulfill their dream of a lifetime.
Oh, all right, all right.
We will.
You?
- Do you have any experience?
- No.
You're hired.
Boy, making pizza really brings back a flood of childhood memories.
Make a lot of pizza as a kid?
No.
My favorite uncle, Uncle Gunther, used to sprinkle Parmesan cheese on his hair.
Why would he do that?
He said it was the perfect compliment to the croutons he'd taped to his eyebrows.
He had a Caesar complex.
Salad, not Julius.
Rose, maybe you ought to work on the knishes.
Or did you have an uncle who was a Mr. Potato Head?
Dorothy, you're just cranky 'cause you haven't had a cigarette in a while.
Maybe a little.
But I'll tell you the truth, I think I'm over the worst.
That's great.
I'm really proud of you.
You'd think you'd miss that feeling you get with that first puff, that feeling of relaxation when you hold it in, and then the sheer exhilaration as you exhale slowly.
No, not really.
I've found other ways to ease my tensions.
Honey, would you hand me that large saucepan?
- Oh, sure.
- No, the one behind it, the really big one.
You know, you really have to give Max and Sophia credit.
This business was their dream, and they're going after it.
- I wish I'd done that with my dream.
- Fine.
- Honey, would you check on the pizzas?
- Why don't you want to hear my dream?
Because it is always the same thing with you, Blanche.
Sex, sex, sex.
I am tired of hearing it.
Maybe that's because you're not getting any, Dorothy.
Do you want the pot again, Rose?
Well, it just so happens that it was not about sex.
There's a lot more than that to Blanche Devereaux.
My dream was to be a great scientist.
Work in a laboratory.
Do research.
Find a cure for the common cold.
You know, Blanche, I owe you an apology.
I thought Then I'd knock all those test tubes off the table, grab a Ph.D., and show those lab rabbits how it's really done.
It's gonna be a long afternoon.
This is so depressing.
We haven't had a customer in two hours.
Well, that's because we need promotion.
You know, Blanche is right.
It doesn't matter how good your product is, you have to know how to promote it.
That sure was the case with Fritz Vanderhoeven, who owned the St. Olaf Motor Coach Company.
- They built a car in St. Olaf?
- They sure did.
The Vanderhoeven Rocket.
Oh, it was a beauty.
Fritz really had vision.
Actually, he had double vision, which is why it had eight tires.
So, uh What happened?
It never got off the ground.
Bad promotion.
Which was a shame, because it's the first car to this day that ran on free fuel.
It was totally powered by cow manure.
I think a lot of people were turned off by the ad - a cow sitting on a gas tank, reading the Farmers'Almanac.
- How's it going?
- Ma, what are you doing here?
I feel better and I wanted to get some air.
How's business?
We've only had two customers all day.
I think it's such a nice hot day, they're all in the water.
That's your problem?
You can't get the people out of the water?
Amateurs.
Let me show you how you run a pizza-knish stand at the beach.
- Shark!
Shark!
Shark!
-  Now they're out of the water, start selling.
- Uh, pizza.
- Step right up.
And after Ma got everybody out of the water, people started trying our food.
Before we knew it, there wasn't a pizza or a knish left on the shelf.
- The place is a hit.
- Sophia, I am very proud of you.
Not only did you save the business, but you saved all those people from the shark.
Don't look so worried.
I handle the books.
Hello?
What?
- Oh, no No, we'll be right there.
- What's the matter?
- I don't understand it.
- How could the stand burn to the ground?
- I don't know.
- We were so careful.
I have a confession to make.
The reason I sent you two ahead and said I'd lock up is because I wanted a cigarette.
And I guess I didn't put it out.
- Oh - Well, I wouldn't worry.
How much harm can it do?
The place already burnt down.
Rose, you dummy, she means her cigarette started the fire.
Max, Ma, I have never felt so bad in my entire life.
I don't know what to say.
It was an accident, pussycat.
Don't worry about it.
- That's it?
That's all you have to say?
- Uh-huh.
Oh, Ma, please yell at me.
Please scream at me.
Please make me feel guilty.
I mean, if you don't say anything, I'll feel twice as bad.
I know.
I'm not an amateur at this.
We finally found the cause of the fire.
Take me away.
Cuff me.
Well, I'd like to take you to dinner first.
Then we could play the rest by ear.
But business before pleasure.
Your fire was caused by a faulty coil in the pizza oven.
I'll write up a report for your insurance company.
But this is wonderful news!
Dorothy, it wasn't your fault.
And with the insurance money, Max and Sophia can build again, bigger and better than ever.
From these ashes a phoenix will rise!
Stronger, healthier, more vibrant, more successful than before.
Eh.
Why did you say "Ah"?
- It just came out.
- Me too.
Did you have fun rebuilding the old business?
Ah It always felt like something was missing.
I can tell you what that was.
My Salvadore.
And my Esther.
Sophia, I think we got a problem here.
Is there anything we can do, Sophia?
Go get two cheesecakes and wait up for me.
I have a feeling the four of us will be talking till dawn.
Max, do you love me?
Sure.
You?
I love you.
Are you in love with me?
What is this?
The Oprah Winfrey Show?
You know what I mean.
Are you in love with me the way you were with Esther?
- No.
Do you love me the way you did Sal?
- I thought I did.
But now I think I might have confused a great friendship with a great love.
Boy, if this was Ronald Colman and Greer Garson, there wouldn't be a dry eye in the house.
This is the kind of mistake you make when you're 19.
It gives me hope to think you can be just as dopey at 82.
So.
Do you want to get a divorce?
Hey, I'm Catholic.
I don't need a divorce on my record with St. Peter in spitting distance.
I say we get separated.
Fine.
That's a better idea.
I'll go back to Brooklyn.
My family's there, my grandkids.
And I miss the old neighborhood.
And I'll stay here in Miami.
Ever since I lost my Sal, the ladies I live with are my family.
But that doesn't mean we can't get together occasionally for You know.
You can do that when you're just friends?
Hey, I want to get in good with St. Peter, I don't want his job.
You know, me and Esther, and you and Salvadore, we were all good together.
The best.
Hey, Mister.
You want me to play "It Had To Be You," for the two of you?
I want you to play it for the four of us.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
- Who's the letter from, Ma?
- Joanne Pescatore.
She's coming to Miami for a visit.
Joanne Pescatore?
Didn't she own that candy store down the street in Brooklyn?
- That was Jeanette Passadano.
- Oh.
Then who was Joanne Pescatore?
How the hell should I know?
This letter's for Rose.
Ma, why are you reading Rose's mail?
Because all you got were bills.
Listen to this.
Tell me if you think Joanne's a lesbian.
Ma.
Hi, Sophia.
Hi, Dorothy.
Guess what I've got.
A friend who's a lesbian?
Better.
I picked up our weekly lottery tickets.
Oh, girls, it's been such a glorious day.
All afternoon I was in the mood for leather and I finally found exactly what I wanted.
Fine, Blanche.
Just make sure his motorcycle doesn't block the driveway.
Can we save the chat for later?
If we hit the jackpot, I wanna live to spend it.
- What jackpot?
- I picked up our lottery tickets.
Here we go.
I forget.
How does this go again?
To win something, you have to get three to match?
Right.
If you get three coconuts, you win $100.
What if you get three palm trees?
You don't have three palm trees.
That means you win $10,000.
Ma, I know what a palm tree looks like.
You also know what a handsome doctor looks like.
It doesn't mean you've got one.
Sophia, she's right.
- Three palm trees.
- $10,000.
- Oh, my God.
We just won $10,000.
- $10,000!
- I don't believe it!
- $10,000!
Split four ways that's almost $ 2,000 apiece.
Almost.
- Where are you going, Ma?
- To order that cherry red tricycle with the grocery bag sidecar.
Don't laugh.
You ride one past a shuffleboard court, you got old guys coming out of your hair.
$10,000!
God, life is beautiful.
Now I don't feel so guilty about spending all that money on this leather jacket.
I don't mean to be a party pooper, but it looks like they sold you a jacket that someone returned.
It's kind of beat-up.
No, Rose, that's the way it's supposed to look.
It's an aviator jacket.
And now I can afford some accessories for it.
- Like a purse?
- Like an aviator.
Here, let's just put that lucky ticket in my jacket pocket for safekeeping till tomorrow.
I think we ought to go out to dinner to celebrate.
- What a great idea.
I'll go freshen up.
- Me too.
I'll get my purse.
- Where's everybody going?
- Dinner.
Get ready.
- I am ready.
I'm always ready.
-  You do that at 82.
That, and carry hard candy.
Hi, I'm Dave from Lincoln Hospital.
That's nice.
If my blood pressure goes up, you'll be the first person I call.
No, wait!
I'm from the thriftshop.
Somebody called about donating some old stuff.
Oh, yeah, right.
These boxes over here.
Oh, wait a minute.
This beat-up old thing must be for you too.
Thanks.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
- OK, let's celebrate.
- We should order champagne.
- And caviar.
- Yahoo!
We're rich!
It has to be here somewhere.
It's not in the laundry room closet.
- It's not in my bedroom, but I knew that.
- I am positive you left it on the couch.
We gotta find that jacket.
It's driving me crazy.
All right.
I wasn't gonna say anything, but since it's kinda my fault, I'll pay for a new jacket.
- What do you mean it's your fault?
- Do you know where the jacket is?
What did you do with it, Ma?
Stand back.
I know how to use this thing.
Spill it, Ma.
I'm scared.
I'll do anything you say.
Where is the jacket, Ma?
- I gave it to the thriftshop.
- You what?
- Let's get down there before they sell it.
- What's the big deal?
It was an old jacket.
We put the winning lottery ticket in the pocket.
Start the engine and open the door.
I'll jump in at the bottom of the driveway.
Uh, excuse me, sir.
We are looking for a leather jacket that got mixed up with a box of clothes we donated.
It was a terrible mistake.
It was not a terrible mistake.
It was a regular mistake.
A terrible mistake is when you forget A Different World follows Cosby.
Oh, I remember you.
I just picked that stuff up a couple of hours ago.
- Then it's still here?
- It must be.
I just put it out.
Uh, Michael decided to take this.
Dorothy, that's our jacket.
Do something.
I'm sorry, Rose.
I left my flamethrower in my other purse.
Here, let me handle this.
Listen here.
I would like to have a word with you.
I paid good money for that jacket and before you walk out of here with it, there's something I want to say.
What?
The zipper sticks a little.
Pardon.
Excuse me.
Would it be possible to try that jacket on?
Just for a minute.
Uh, no time, ma'am.
Michael has to get to the concert.
Look, if you don't mind, I would like to see this Michael.
You and the rest of Miami.
Sorry.
The entire engagement is sold out.
Michael.
- Do you know who that is?
- Sure.
The guy from Pepsi commercials.
Pepsi commercia Michael Oh, my God!
That's Michael J. Fox!
- Please can we talk to you for a minute?
- Michael, it's very important.
We won't bother you.
Michael!
Yes, yes, that's right.
It was a winning ticket, but we gave the jacket away.
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much.
Yes, I'll tell 'em.
I'm sure they'll appreciate it.
- Bye.
- What did he say?
He was in agreement.
It was a miscarriage of justice and we deserve the money.
Oh!
Great.
He also told me I'd called his Chinese restaurant instead of the Lottery Commission.
Oh.
He felt so bad, he's giving us free egg rolls the next time we come in.
Oh, what's the difference?
It's over.
If we don't have the ticket, we can't claim the prize.
Sophia, are you all right?
You haven't said a word in hours.
Oh, I'm fine.
I was thinking about what I'd planned with my share of the winnings.
I wanted to get each one of you something special for being so kind and allowing a Ionely old woman to live with you.
Oh, Sophia.
Maybe if we went to a movie it'd make us feel better.
- Can we afford it?
- Oh, come on, now.
This is ridiculous.
We are not poor.
We thought we had $10,000 and now we don't, but we're no better or worse off than we were 24 hours ago.
If that was a pep talk, it stunk.
Look at this.
There's a celebrity auction to benefit the homeless and they're selling a leather jacket worn by a major rock star at his concert last night.
- Let me see.
- What?
Oh, I don't believe it.
This is it.
This has to be it.
Come on, let's get going.
- We can't go to a charity event like this.
- The auction started 20 minutes ago.
I'm right behind you.
Hey, those gifts I was talking about, they were more tokens of affection than actual gifts, you know?
They're cheap?
Just so everyone understands the ground rules.
OK, let's roll.
The bid's 900.
sold for $900.
Congratulations.
And now, moving along to item number 17.
A leather jacket recently worn in concert by one of the world's leading musical talents.
- Get ready.
This is it.
- I have a really dumb question.
And I have a box of Chiclets.
What's your point?
- How high do we bid?
- High.
High.
I mean, even if it costs us $1,000, we'll still have $9,000 left.
Don't start high.
We might get it for a couple of hundred.
- We'll start at $100 and see how it goes.
- OK, OK, OK.
And now, may I have an opening bid, please?
- Excuse me?
- $10,000.
sold for $10,000.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you so much.
Could I say a few words to the audience?
For ten grand they should let him shower with the audience.
I guess now I'll never get to fly on the Concorde.
I'll never get to buy that emerald pendant to dangle between my perky bosoms.
And I'll never get to buy perky bosoms.
But what the hell.
Nothing else perks on this body.
Maybe we can get the jacket for a minute and grab the ticket out of the pocket.
That's a great idea.
I bet I could use a little friendly persuasion on that gentleman.
Persuasion?
This isn't dinner at the Rainbow Room, this is ten big ones.
Give him whatever he wants.
Sorry.
I guess I just didn't realize how much I wanted that money.
Thank you.
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm congressman Philip Starr and I've recently been accused of being insensitive to the homeless.
Well, I think tonight's sizeable cash contribution should lay those accusations to rest.
- He doesn't even care about the jacket.
- It's a miracle.
This is going to be easy.
Well, don't take any chances.
Sleep with him anyway.
Sorry.
And as a symbolic gesture to underscore my concern, I've done something very special tonight.
In addition to my sizeable donation, I've just dispatched my top aide to one of many shelters in our community with the jacket I've just purchased.
May it provide warmth and comfort to one of our city's homeless.
We're screwed.
- Are you sure we're in the right place?
- Mission Street Shelter for the homeless.
- This is where they sent the jacket.
- Kinda drab, isn't it?
Blanche, it's a shelter, not the flagship of the Hilton chain.
Kinda reminds me of the Shady Pines Retirement Home, except here the lights in the exit sign work.
- What's our plan?
- What is this?
Mission: Impossible?
Do I look like Peter Graves?
You could if you'd put a rinse in your hair and wear a lighter lipstick like I beg Here, I'll tell you what our plan is.
Now, there's $10,000 at stake.
To find that jacket and get that ticket we will lie, cheat, threaten and steal if we have t - Oh, hello.
- Anybody got a backup plan?
Sorry.
I didn't know anyone was here.
I was locking up.
Father, we desperately need your help.
Frankly, I'm not sure we have enough beds, but you're welcome to stay.
- Oh, we don't want to stay.
- Oh, yes, we do.
- We have to, just for one night.
- There's no need to be embarrassed.
We're not here to judge, we're here to keep you safe and warm.
Let me get some pillows.
I'll be right back.
- This is insane.
- I'm not leaving here without it.
- I'm with Blanche.
We've come this far.
- After we get in, split up and look.
Here are your pillows.
The blankets are on the beds and lights out's in just a few minutes.
The beds are right through here.
Are you gonna tie a bow in that when you've finished wrapping it up?
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to disturb you.
I'm a bit compulsive.
- It's the Minnesota farm girl in me.
- You're from Minnesota?
- Yes.
- No kidding?
So am I. Well, what a coincidence.
Isn't that amazing?
St. Olaf.
Ben Wheaton.
Pleased to meet you.
Oh, no, my name is Rose Nylund.
I come from St. Olaf.
I should've known that you weren't a saint.
It's too much to expect a miracle this late in the game.
- What happened?
- Oh, bedtime, Rose.
- Does that mean we can't talk anymore?
- No, they just like you to stay in your beds.
Oh, darn.
I didn't get to brush my teeth.
I know how you feel.
I always make sure I brush after every meal.
You wouldn't happen to have a meal on you, would you?
- What are you staring at?
- Your purse.
You just be careful, son.
There is a long list of men who bear the scars of trying the wrong thing at the wrong time with me.
Scars, I might add, that are not visible to the general public.
I thought you might have a piece of gum.
Oh.
Well, I might.
You want me to take a look?
Forget it.
Listen, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to snap at you like that.
I'm just a little uncomfortable here.
Helps if you stuff newspapers under the mattress.
That's not what I meant.
I was talking about being here at the shelter.
This is your first time?
Oh, lord, it's been ages since I heard that from a man.
Yes, it is my first time.
- I can give you a few pointers if you like.
- Now, that I've never heard before.
- Are you comfortable, Ma?
- Oh, yeah.
Before we leave, I wanna get the model number off this cot.
I'm hoping Ethan Allen makes one in knotty pine.
Ma, try to make the best of it, OK?
We're gonna be here for a while.
I don't think Blanche or Rose spotted the jacket either.
I don't believe it.
That's Ida Perkins.
What?
That's Ida Perkins.
What the hell is she doing here?
Were you kidding me about being from Minnesota?
Absolutely not.
I spent 22 years working the prime noon-to-eight shift at the Minneapolis Excelsior Hotel.
I don't believe it.
Where did you live in Minneapolis?
Oh, 22 years, lots of places, but my last home was near Bartholomew and Third.
Oh, that's a lovely neighborhood.
Why did you leave?
Well, I liked to entertain a lot, but the cardboard box I was living in was only suitable for small dinner parties.
Breakfast is cereal and coffee.
They ask for a quarter, but if you don't have it, no one makes a fuss.
Just make sure you get there early.
A lot of times they run out.
Well, lovely as that sounds, Kenny, I usually skip breakfast.
When you're 45, you have to keep an eye on your figure, if you know what I mean.
Blanche, who do you think you're fooling?
Oh, all right.
That's not what I mean.
What are you doing in this place?
You don't belong here.
- I most certainly do.
- Hey, hey, it's OK.
I'm just curious.
See, I don't belong here either.
- You don't?
- No.
I'm in graduate school.
I'm undercover, working on my doctorate in sociology.
I knew it.
I knew it.
The minute we started talking, I said to myself: "Now, how could a bright boy like him end up here"?
You're more like my own son than you are like those people you see stopping strangers for spare change.
Oh, well, that explains it all.
Now I feel much better.
So you're really a student working on your doctorate.
I'm really an alcoholic who needs a place to sleep.
- What?
- It's true.
I've already got my doctorate.
We had some great times at the home, didn't we, Ida?
We sure did.
Dorothy, Ida was the best bar none at faking an angina attack at dinner so we could swap our nonfat yogurt for real sour cream.
There wasn't a patient at Shady Pines that didn't bless Ida every time we sat down to eat a baked potato.
When did you leave the home, Mrs. Perkins?
Maybe a year now.
I don't really keep track.
Well, what made you decide to leave?
Decide?
Some things in life you never get to decide.
Some things just happen.
What happened, Ida?
I didn't know - nobody told me - that it cost money to get old.
I just figured that was one thing you'd get for free.
It isn't.
The home cost money, the doctors cost money, medicine costs money.
You know, I always thought it was sad I outlived my whole family, but I never knew it was going to be a punishment.
The hotel business started to slump.
Hundreds of people got laid off.
I went looking for work, but believe it or not, most businesses aren't anxious to train a 55-year-old black hotel porter.
Go figure it, huh?
It's all about pressure from family, from professors, from friends.
No room to slide.
Have to be perfect.
Guess what, Blanche.
I'm not perfect.
So they sent me a letter.
The money was gone.
I asked for some help.
They gave me some phone numbers.
The streets were cold in Minnesota.
It took me nearly three months, but I finally made it to Miami.
I Will you listen to me, just running on?
Tell you what, you tell me your sad story over breakfast.
Good night.
I couldn't survive out there, but I'm learning to survive here.
Which reminds me, hold on to that purse.
I didn't really want any gum.
I wander now.
I don't decide anything anymore.
I wait for things to happen.
- Look for the jacket.
- I guess.
Let's split up.
# They used to tell me ?
I was a building a dream ?
With peace and glory ahead ?
Why should I be standing in line ?
Just waiting for bread?
?
Once I built a rainbow ?
Made it run # Made it race against time ?
Once I built a railroad ?
Now it's done # Brother.
can you spare a dime?
Ida, I know it's rough by yourself.
I count my blessings that I have my Dorothy to look after me, but you can't give up.
People care.
They really do.
Good people won't let this kind of suffering go on.
You just gotta hang in there till tomorrow.
Sophia, it is tomorrow.
I found it.
Good morning.
Here you go, Padre.
Thanks for everything.
# Brother.
can you spare a dime?
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend"   Hey!
You're not even gonna ask what's wrong?
What's wrong, Ma?
I got three days to live.
Fine, Ma.
I'll scratch the Bengay off the grocery list.
I can't believe you're so insensitive.
Ma, you are not dying.
I am, Dorothy.
I had a dream last night, a death dream.
Your father spoke to me.
Spoke to you?
How?
Do I look like Rich Little?
Just listen.
I'm sitting in the living room, and the clock strikes 9:00.
Then the bell rings.
It's your father in his fedora.
He always wore a fedora on Saturday.
He walks towards me, reaches out his hand and says, "Sophia, you can come now.
There's room for you now".
That's it?
You want him to show up with Barbara Eden and the college all-American football team?
It's a dream, not a Bob Hope special.
I'm dying, Dorothy.
Saturday, 9:00.
Don't make any plans.
Ma, you're being ridiculous.
I know.
When was the last Saturday night you had plans?
Oh, thank you, Dorothy.
Those look lovely.
So do you.
Oh, Blanche, you really got all dressed up for your brother.
Well, we do come from the South.
We always felt it was important to look absolutely great in front of company.
Hi, girls.
What time does Clayton get here?
Oh, any minute now.
Oh, we better put out the welcome mat.
We don't have a welcome mat.
What about the one Dorothy says is at the foot of your bed?
Oh, there's Clayton now.
Remember what I said.
No remarks about his marriage breaking up.
He's still a little touchy.
Clayton!
Baby brother!
Sister!
Oh, my, look at you all gussied up.
Prettier than a spring-bloomin' peach tree on a dewy April morning.
Well, you oughtta talk, all fresh-scrubbed and rosy-cheeked like a country parson at a September hoedown.
Why do I get the feeling they had a maid named Honeybee when they grew up?
Come on in, Clayton.
I want you to meet my best friends Dorothy and Rose.
Nice to meet you.
It's a pleasure.
Rose, so nice to see you.
How was your trip, Clayton?
Oh, fine.
It just went by in no time.
That usually means he met a stewardess he liked.
Blanche.
Lunch, dinner or drinks?
Dinner.
I'm beginning to see the family resemblance.
Honey, come on inside.
I'll get you all settled down.
Then I want to tell you all the wonderful things I have planned for us to do.
OK.
It was so nice finally meeting you all.
See you later, Clayton.
Isn't it nice to see a brother and sister who are such good friends?
It certainly is.
Oh, I always wish that I could have been closer to my brother, Phil.
You know, go places together, share experiences.
Although I did love borrowing his clothes.
Did you like wearing boys' clothes growing up?
No, but fortunately neither did my brother Phil.
Ma, why are you sitting here in the dark?
Conserving electricity for those who will still be living past Saturday.
Oh, Ma Put out your hands, Dorothy.
What for?
So I can say hello like Magic Johnson.
So I'm gonna give you some of my personal things.
My bank book, some stocks Oh, Ma, come on, now.
This is crazy.
Hi, y'all.
Oh, fabulous.
Roy and Dale are back.
So, where are you two off to tonight?
Oh, that's a surprise.
Wait a minute.
Isn't that my silver locket in there?
Nice getting to know you, gomer.
See you around.
What's all this about a surprise?
Oh, well, I've done a little matchmaking.
Blanche, not again.
Yes, again.
Now, you are 45 years old.
You've been single almost two years.
Well, both Dorothy and I know how much fun the single life is.
Many's the night Dorothy has sat here alone in this room watching me go out on dates.
Sometimes I watch her go from the kitchen window.
It's easier to bay at the moon.
I just don't want you being afraid to get back on that horse and make a commitment again.
Here's your horse pulling up now.
Hello, Lois.
Come in.
Clayton, remember Lois from the museum?
Of course.
So nice to see you again.
Oh, it's a pleasure.
You two can get reacquainted on the way.
These are your tickets for the concert in the park.
It starts in 15 minutes, so you better hurry up, now.
Bye.
Have a good time!
Good night!
I was never any good at blind dating.
I always felt so awkward.
Oh, Dorothy, I have a surefire icebreaker I can teach you right now.
Oh, once you learn this any man is putty in your hands.
Oh, Blanche, come on.
That is ridiculous.
I mean, I'm certainly not gonna waste my time listening to this adolescent nonsense.
Did you say putty?
Ha ha ha ha.
Sit back.
Now, just play like we're at the movies.
OK.
First I start to yawn a little.
Then I put my hands up over my head like this Oh, Blanche, I know that one.
You end up with your arm around me.
Yeah, but that's just the first part.
Did you know that if you blow right on the tip of a man's earlobe, it can drive him absolutely crazy?
I'll show you.
I'm gonna be dead in 24 hours.
Couldn't you stay in the closet for one more day?
Rose, what are you doing here?
Clayton.
It's my late night at the counseling center.
But what are you doing here?
Blanche told me she was sending you on a date.
Oh, she did.
Didn't it work out?
Well, let's just say Blanche has it in her head what type is right for me, and she's way off.
I'll bet I could sit here for a minute and tell you what your type is.
I'm good at this.
Gosh, I'm stuck.
You haven't even started.
No, I'm stuck on the gum somebody left on this bench.
OK, now, you just give me your honest reactions when people go by.
That's how I'll tell.
OK.
Here comes one.
Go.
No.
Too thin.
Here comes one.
Too short?
Next.
Oh, Clayton!
Clayton, you're not playing fair.
That's a man.
That's a man and you're a man.
You're both men.
Clayton, you're that thing that everyone said Olga Larsen's nephew was 'cause he wore paisley clogs and gave out puff pastry on Halloween.
I've been called a lot of things in my time, but that's a first for that one.
Yeah, I'm gay, Rose.
But Blanche told us you were married.
I was.
After a while I just couldn't deny the truth to myself.
Seems silly still denying it to my big sister.
Well, have you tried telling her?
Every time I see her.
And I always chicken out.
Oh I know Blanche.
I mean, she'd be upset, but not for long.
And just think how it would help you two in the long run.
But how do I keep from chickening out?
By telling her.
Tonight, while you've still got your dander up.
I'm sorry.
Did I say something embarrassing?
No.
No, Rose.
You're right.
You're absolutely right.
I've got to tell her tonight.
But it's not gonna be easy.
I mean, I still haven't told Blanche I was the one who stole the Montgomery Clift poster off her wall when she left for college.
Ma, what are you doing up?
Someone left the lock off my cage.
I couldn't sleep.
I was afraid I'd have that dream again.
What are you two doing up?
Well, I'm waiting up for Clayton.
I'm gonna make sure he had a good time tonight.
My brother and I are very close.
Oh, that's sweet, Blanche.
Evening, ladies.
Well, Clayton Hollingsworth, it's about time.
You and your date must have really hit it off.
Hey, Rose.
What are you doing with Clayton?
We ran into each other in the park.
What happened to Lois?
Oh, she went home.
We weren't really suited, Blanche.
Not suited?
Clayton, sometimes I do not understand you.
Time after time I fix you up with attractive, eligible women, and nothing happens.
It's time you found yourself a woman.
Now, what is the matter with you?
Tell her, Clayton.
I will, Rose.
Tell me what?
Well, I ran into Rose in the park, and And?
And we had a long talk, and And?
And we slept together tonight.
Dorothy, all that stuff I said about preparing for a burial, forget it.
Oh, Ma.
You finally came to your senses.
Yes.
I decided to be cremated instead.
Oh, Ma.
Oh It's a great idea.
My ashes can be divided among you, your brother, Phil, and your sister, Gloria.
Nah, forget Gloria.
I don't want to spread myself too thin.
Hi, girls.
I need to talk.
Oh, honey, what is it?
All day long Blanche has been giving me looks.
I think she's really mad at me.
Look, Rose, what happened between you and Clayton last night is your business, not Blanche's.
That's just the point, Dorothy.
Nothing happened between Clayton and me.
Nothing physical, anyway.
Well, why did Clayton say the two of you slept together if you hadn't?
Because he's trying to hide something about himself from Blanche.
I don't even feel right saying it out loud.
Maybe if I just whispered it.
Clayton is a hobo?
No, Dorothy.
Oh!
Oh!
Now, now I get it.
Oh, good.
I thought I was gonna have to draw you a picture.
And I'm not sure I'd know how.
Hey!
I don't get to know?
No, Ma.
OK, have it your way, but nobody can keep a secret from Sophia Petrillo.
Whatever that guy's hiding, I could smoke it out of him in three or four quick questions.
Hello, ladies.
Perfect timing.
Ma.
So, Clayton, what do you think of this Miami weather so far?
Oh, it's lovely.
I see.
Have you ever been to Europe?
No, but it's always been a dream of mine.
Interesting.
How many fingers am I holding up?
Two.
Fine.
You can go back in the living room now.
The man's as gay as a picnic basket.
Ma, that that is That is incredible.
How did you know?
I heard him singing in the shower.
He's the only man I ever knew who knows all the words to "Send In The Clowns".
Rose, I owe you an apology.
You sure do.
I shouldn't have got you mixed up in all this.
It's just so hard to tell Blanche the truth.
Clayton, you're selling your sister short.
Now, at times, Blanche can be very understanding and compassionate and forgiving.
Get away from my baby brother, you cradle-snatching, empty-headed, two-faced dummy.
And then at other times she can be a real bitch.
Blanche, there's something you should know.
Butt out, Clayton.
This doesn't concern you.
It most certainly does concern him.
Why?
Because he was seduced by a bubble-head whose hair looks like it was colorized by Ted Turner?
Now, just a minute.
Butt out, Clayton.
This doesn't concern you.
You're gonna regret this when you have to come begging on hands and knees for forgiveness.
Oh?
Then I shall never regret it, because I never intend to apologize.
We'll see about that.
I wish you hadn't done that, Blanche.
Oh, hush up.
It was for your own good.
There's something you just don't understand.
Oh, I understand perfectly.
I pushed you into meeting all those women.
That's why this happened.
But it is over.
Rose will be just fine.
Blanche, it's not as simple Oh, Clayton, honey, leave it alone.
Blanche, listen.
Nothing happened between me and Rose.
Just like nothing ever happens between me and any of the women you set me up with.
There's a reason.
What are you saying, Clayton?
I'm saying I'm gay, Blanche.
Oh, Clayton, please be serious.
You're just saying that so I won't set you up with any more women.
No, Blanche.
Well, then you're saying it 'cause you're trying to get back at me for something.
Blanche Clay, I know you too well for this.
After all, I know it can't be true.
You're my brother.
It's true, Blanche.
Maybe I ought to just leave you alone for a while.
Clayton Hollingsworth.
You look me in the face and tell me you really are what you just said you are.
I think you heard me the first time, Blanche.
Hey, Harry.
Flip on the game, will you?
Not another game.
Come on.
Tina, let's go.
I'll see you back at the house.
Clayton.
Blanche.
How'd you find me here?
Well, I knew that you and Rose were here last night.
May I join you?
Of course.
Thank you.
You know what that popcorn reminds me of?
Rex's Drive-In out at the lake.
You remember the night my date and I parked right next to you and your date?
Pretty soon it got to be a contest who could fog up whose car the fastest.
I think you won.
You weren't doing too badly considering you were in a convertible.
Yes.
You know, Clay, I've been thinking a lot about what you told me today, and I've also been thinking a lot about that boy at Rex's Drive-In, and, honey, the two pictures don't go together.
There's just something wrong with one of them.
But it's not the one you're hoping, Blanche.
It was the heater fogging up my car windows that night.
So what can I bring you, sweetheart?
Don't you dare talk to him like that.
Now, you get out of here.
Blanche, I think he was talking to you.
Oh.
Oh.
I'm having a little trouble putting this all together.
Clayton, I just feel like I don't know you anymore.
I'm the same person I always was.
No, you're not.
You used to be just like me.
What?
Great-looking?
Yes.
Charming?
Yes.
Irresistible to men?
My God, Clayton, you are me.
But I still just can't Blanche.
I spent a long time lying to myself.
It felt a lot better when I stopped.
It feels better being honest with you, too, and I'd hate to think that this is gonna keep us from being friends.
Well, honey, of course it isn't.
Oh, no.
I'll get used to this.
I will.
Well, look at me already.
I'm practically comfortable seeing you here in a gay bar.
Blanche, this isn't a gay bar.
Clay, now, we did say we were gonna be honest with each other.
All right, now, I can do my part.
You just watch this.
You all, over at the bar.
I just want to say that I would be very proud to have any one of you date my brother.
I'd rather date you, lady.
Sweet Jesus, I've just done the impossible.
I've converted one.
Dorothy, get dressed.
We're going out to celebrate Clayton's last night in town.
Oh, terrific.
Let's go to JosÃ©'s.
We always go there to celebrate.
The food is great.
And they make all the waiters wear these really skintight bullfighters' pants.
Really?
Let's go to Amelio's.
T minus ten seconds, Dorothy.
Oh, Ma, will you give it up?
You are not dying.
Eight, seven, six There is not going to be a doorbell or a pop.
five, four, three, two one.
There is not going to be anything.
You see?
Ten seconds, nothing happened.
Oh, God!
Ma, stop.
Oh, suddenly somebody believes me.
Did I hear the bell?
Listen, Rose, do me a favor.
Look out the peephole and see who's at the door.
Sure, Dorothy.
Gee, it's kinda hard to tell.
All I can see is a fedora.
Oh, my God.
Who's that at the door?
It's me, Blanche.
The other side.
Move, Rose.
Ma, don't.
I have to, Dorothy.
Ma!
Mildred, what are you doing here?
When do I always wear my lucky bowling hat?
We're bowling tonight?
Didn't you get my message the other night?
No one answered the door.
I figured you were napping, so I yelled outside your window we had room.
Wait Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Were your exact words, "Sophia, you can come now.
We have room now"?
And were you wearing that hat at the time?
Yes.
Hasta luego, Dorothy.
I'm going bowling.
Well, let's go to dinner, ladies.
Have fun.
Rose, honey.
There's something I have to say to you.
It's just two little words, but they are the hardest two little words in all the whole world for me to say.
"Not tonight"?
No.
Blanche, if you've come here to apologize, I accept.
Just like that?
Yes.
I mean, for me, just the fact that you thought of those words is plenty considering what a selfish, conceited person you are.
But I had a whole speech planned, Rose a-about how nice you were to my brother and-and how proud I am to have such a sweet person as my friend.
Now I can't say it.
Well, sure you can.
No, I can't.
You just ruined it.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Oh, I forgive you, Rose.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" What are you doing home?
I thought you were on a date with Jerry.
So did I. He let me out at the movie theater and said he was gonna go park the car.
That's the last I saw of him.
I think you've been ditched.
Now, did I ask you?
If I want advice on getting ditched, I'll ask an expert.
Dorothy, did I get ditched?
Yes, Blanche, but don't feel bad.
Look what it's done for Sonny Bono.
Then it's finally happened.
I cannot believe it.
I have lost it, haven't I?
In more backseats than any woman I know.
You're not feeling any better, are you?
I'm fine, thank you.
You look terrible.
Gee, I guess I won't be making it in the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue this year like the rest of you.
Dorothy's concerned about your health.
We all are.
You have been walking around sick for over a week.
You'd feel a lot better if you would just obey the doctor's orders.
Look, either you're gonna follow his orders or I'll call him and tell on you.
Oh, what is he gonna do?
Come over and spank me?
If he does, tell him to come by my room.
Who can that be at this hour?
Maybe it's Blanche's date.
Oh, he better not show up here.
I'll get it.
Hi, everyone.
It's me, Stan.
Look, I know it's late, but I had to come by.
I have awesome news.
Dating someone over 12?
Ma, that's not nice.
Is that it, Stanley?
No.
Congratulate me, everyone.
I'm getting hitched.
Oh, that's wonderful.
Well, congratulations, Stanley.
Tell us all about it.
Her name is Katherine.
We met at the post office.
We discovered we had a lot in common.
Oh, is she bald too?
For the first few months I found myself sending her flowers, candy, friendship notes for no special reason.
That's lovely, Stan.
I'm impressed.
Yeah, I read in a book by some dame shrink that chicks really eat that stuff up.
Anyway, Katherine and I fell in love and on the spur of the moment we decided to get married.
The wedding is a week from tonight and you're all invited.
I talked to the kids.
They said they'll try and fly in.
I gotta go now.
I'm on my way to surprise Katherine with this.
What do you think?
I think Lisa Bonet spent more on the ring in her nose.
Don't listen to her.
It's beautiful.
I'm sure Katherine will love it.
You mean it?
Not a word.
Babe, it's a real diamond.
What's wrong with it?
I think the more appropriate question is "Where is it"?
OK, the diamond's not very big.
OK, it's not a real diamond.
It's the thought that counts.
OK, I didn't put much thought into it.
It was cheap.
I'm cheap.
What can I tell you?
Why don't you let me help you pick out something else for Katherine?
I'll help too.
There's nothing wrong with my taste.
You've seen that ring I picked for Dorothy.
Actually, he was going for a bracelet, but the mechanical claw grabbed the ring.
OK, girls.
I guess I do need some help.
I'll call tomorrow and we'll set up a time to go shopping.
I really have to run now.
I'm fixing a terrific late-night supper for Katherine.
Oh, really?
In 38 years of marriage, you never once cooked a terrific meal for us.
Neither did you.
Ma, I thought you were supposed to be taking it easy.
When I feel bad I have to take my mind off it.
There's only one thing that does that.
Cooking a big meal.
No.
Making love in a closet.
But, hey, you do what you can.
Hi, we're back.
We helped Stan pick out a ring for Katherine.
I feel terrible.
I think we spent too much money.
Stop worrying about the money.
We're talking about love.
I still think we spent too much.
You didn't spend it.
The yutz spent it.
That's what makes him a yutz.
Sophia's right.
Don't worry about it.
Ma, Ma, I think you better sit down.
Come on.
Over here.
Here you go.
Should I get Sophia a glass of water?
No, Rose.
You should sit here and watch her hack herself to death.
Are you sure?
Get the water!
I am gonna call the doctor.
I can't breathe.
Forget the doctor, Blanche.
Call the paramedics.
What is taking them so long?
It's been over an hour.
I'm sure they're doing the best they can.
The cafeteria was closed.
This is all I could find.
Thanks, honey.
Any word on Sophia?
None.
Oh, I hate waiting.
I hate hospitals.
I hate when the people put each other down on Love Connection.
I got here as fast as I could.
How'd you know where to find us?
I had second thoughts about the ring the girls made me buy so I came by the house.
The neighbors told me what happened.
I'm so happy you're cheap.
So how's Sophia doing?
We still don't know.
Stan, I'm scared.
Mrs. Zbornak?
Dr. Seymour, is my mother going to be all right?
Her condition is quite serious.
But you said it was a simple virus.
It's advanced to pneumonia.
Normally I wouldn't be this concerned, but her resistance is low.
That, coupled with her age, makes these next few hours extremely critical.
Are you saying she could die?
We're doing everything possible.
All we can do is wait and see how she responds to treatment.
Can I see her?
Not until she's out of Intensive Care.
The best thing you can do now is go home and get some rest.
I'll call if there's any change.
Come on, Dorothy, I'll take you home.
No, I'm not leaving.
Then we'll all stay.
No, you go.
Oh, no.
We're not going anywhere.
I would rather be alone.
Please.
Are you sure, babe?
Would it be stupid to ask for a group hug?
Oh, of course not, honey.
Hands above the waist, Stanley.
Hi, babe.
I hope you're hungry.
I thought I sent you home.
I was in the neighborhood.
What?
At one o'clock in the morning?
All right.
I couldn't sleep.
I kept thinking about Sophia.
How is she?
No one has said a word to me in hours.
What?
That's ridiculous.
I'm gonna find somebody, right now.
Excuse me.
I want some information and I want it now.
The john is down the hall.
It's about a patient.
Sophia Petrillo.
She's in Intensive Care.
The cafeteria's closed.
Wait.
Get a doctor in here.
Someone will be with you in just a moment.
You really care about Ma, don't you, Stan?
Hey, if someone puts you down for 40 years, I guess you have a special bond.
I can't imagine life without her telling me what a yutz I am, what a lousy husband I was, how my toupee looks like a monkey's behind.
God, I love that woman.
I do too.
Oh, what are we gonna do if she doesn't make it?
She's going to be fine.
Come on.
Let's eat.
I brought you your favorite.
Oh, you're such a sweetheart.
Chinese.
No, Italian.
Look, there's been no change on the Petrillo case.
We are very busy.
We'll call when we can.
Listen, buddy.
Sophia may be just another case to you, but we happen to love her.
We want to know how she is, regardless.
From now on, I want to be informed every hour, on the hour.
Do you understand me?
I'm sorry, sir.
I'll see that you're kept informed.
You were magnificent.
I have my moments.
Well, what do you want?
Lasagna or cannelloni?
Oh, Ma makes great lasagna.
I can never get mine to taste as good.
She says it's because I don't sing to my marinara sauce.
That's her secret.
She sings opera to her sauce.
Except, of course, during the holiday season when she sings Nat King Cole.
I love your lasagna.
You're just saying that to make me feel better.
Is it working?
Like a charm.
Excuse me.
Mrs. Zbornak.
Oh Oh!
My mother?
She's going to be fine.
You can go up and see her right away.
Thank you.
Oh, she's She's going to be all right.
Stanley, come on.
Let's go see her.
No, no, no.
You go.
You two should be alone.
I'll stay here and clean up.
I'll stop by later.
Stan, thank you for standing by me.
I don't know how I could have done it without you.
Hey, what are ex-husbands for?
Oh, Ma, you scared me to death.
You scared me to death.
You couldn't put on a little makeup?
There could be a single doctor.
I'd like to know you're being taken care of or at least getting a little on the side.
Ma, the doctor says you're gonna be just fine.
Of course I am.
I survived war, disease and two seasons of Designing Women.
Hello, Sophia.
Hi, Sophia.
We stopped by on our way to work to check on you.
How are you?
She's gonna be just fine, only this time she's going to follow the doctor's orders.
What about you?
You must be exhausted being here by yourself all night.
I wasn't alone.
Stan came by and stayed with me.
Brought me food, held me.
Showed me that special part of himself.
Right there in the waiting room?
Not that part, Rose.
Anyway, spending time with Stan made me see something that I hadn't realized.
He dyes the hair in his ears?
I noticed that months ago.
Besides that.
I'm still in love with the man, and I can't let him marry someone else.
Is it me or is the room suddenly getting darker?
Hurry up, Blanche.
Rose, stop pulling on my nightie.
It's only got one yank left in it before it falls completely apart and I'm saving that for Henry Barnsworth.
Shh.
I just don't want Dorothy to hear.
Blanche, we can't let Dorothy ruin Stan and Katherine's wedding.
I mean, it's selfish, it's adolescent and it'd put a real cramp in their honeymoon.
Rose.
For somebody who's supposed to be so smart, Dorothy's acting like a goober.
Rose.
I would say that right to her face.
'Course, I'd have to stand on a chair.
It's her, isn't it?
Now Dorothy, don't you be mad at Rose.
She's only saying what she feels.
What about you?
Do you think I'm terrible because I want my husband back?
Ex-husband, Dorothy.
Ex-husband who left you and didn't have the courtesy to tell you he was leaving.
Ex-husband who married somebody half your age just one week after the divorce.
Ex-husband who's getting married again tomorrow.
I don't know why you want that man.
He's treated you like dirt.
Even that I could overlook if he had a good body.
Look, Blanche, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but my mind is made up.
I love Stanley, I want to be with him, and I am very sorry about Katherine.
What on earth is suddenly so wonderful about Stanley?
Everything, just everything.
He has grown, he has changed.
You should have seen the way he took over when Ma was sick.
He was so commanding, so masterful, and yet so sensitive and so vulnerable.
I know I couldn't have gotten through it without him.
Listen, Dorothy.
You thought Sophia might be dying.
You were the one who was sensitive and vulnerable.
Blanche is right.
At the counseling center I see cases like this all the time.
When people lose loved ones they do things they'd never normally do.
Take Mrs. Polowski.
When her mother died, she divorced her husband, lost 30 pounds, dyed her hair and ran off to Paris with an artist ten years her junior.
I just got a postcard last week.
Yeah, and now she's miserable and bony and sick of eating snails, right?
No.
They bought a beautiful home in Cannes.
Rose!
Granted, not a great example.
Thank you for proving my case, Rose.
Ma getting sick was probably a good thing after all, 'cause it made me see how great Stan is.
All right.
What if this isn't what Stanley wants?
Excellent point.
What about that?
If you had been there that night, you'd know that he feels exactly the same way about me.
Then how come he hasn't called off his wedding and told you he loves you?
Because he is not sure how I feel.
He wants me to make the first move.
Oh, gee, I hadn't counted on this.
She makes good sense.
Rose!
I want to thank you for helping me think this through.
You know, up until now I honestly had a few doubts, but after talking to you I know exactly what I'm gonna do.
Tomorrow, before the wedding, I'm gonna tell Stan I love him.
Well, way to go, Rose.
You talked her into doing exactly the opposite of what we wanted her to do.
I guess that's why they took me off the suicide hotline at work.
Coming.
Hi.
Hi.
Can I come in?
Oh, sure.
Do I look like a man who is about to do it for the third time?
Get married, I mean.
Very handsome.
Have you lost weight?
No, I'm wearing a girdle.
Is Sophia gonna make it to the wedding?
She's not quite up to it.
But she sends her regards and Baggies for me to bring back hors d'oeuvres.
You're wearing a girdle?
And padded shoulders.
Is my head sweating?
No.
Stan, the reason I came  Is the wedding still on?
Of course.
Why wouldn't it be?
He's right.
Why wouldn't it be?
Let's go powder our noses before the ceremony.
Stan, I have to get something off my chest.
I agree.
There.
That's much better.
Boy, I'll say.
OK, let's go.
I am not going anywhere.
Would you girls excuse me?
My girdle is killing me.
He's wearing a girdle?
And padded shoulders.
And knowing him, a sock in his crotch.
What are you two doing here?
We've come to stop you from making a fool of yourself.
Why would Dorothy make a fool of herself?
Well, Stanley, you know how she gets at weddings - all emotional.
Her nose starts running, then her mascara starts running.
Soon everything's running altogether and nobody can enjoy their cake.
Stan, I have to tell you something.
Dorothy, somebody's at the door.
I'll get it.
No, you won't.
Let Dorothy get it.
But I'm closer.
Ow!
My ankle!
Oh, it must be that old plow injury.
Dorothy, honey, could you get the door?
Dorothy stepped out for a breath air.
Why's she banging on the door?
That button's coming off.
Yep, I was right.
We'd better go sew it on.
Bartender, give me another.
Come on, lady.
You don't need another.
Why not?
You've had three already.
I said give me another.
Fine.
It's your life.
Just don't blame me if you get sick.
Excuse me.
Is this seat taken?
No.
Help yourself.
Thanks.
What can I get you, lady?
How about a shot of self-confidence?
Let me guess.
You didn't come in here to drink.
You've got a problem and need someone to talk to.
Am I right?
That's right.
Then take a quarter and call a shrink.
This ain't Cheers.
Are you OK?
Just a little nervous.
I'm supposed to get married in exactly 20 minutes right here in this hotel.
Well, then, what are you doing here?
Cold feet?
Yeah, but not about him.
See, he's got this ex-wife.
You better be careful what you say.
I happen to be an ex-wife.
Not like his, I'm sure.
No one's like her.
She's superwoman.
She was the perfect wife.
Cooked, cleaned, had two kids, got an education, has never looked better, and now she has a career.
That wasn't a marriage.
That's a commercial for a mini pad.
Her name is Dorothy and she's coming to our wedding.
I mean, they're still friends.
Listen to me.
I'm so intimidated by a woman I've never even met.
Well, that's understandable.
I mean, she sounds pretty terrific.
I bet she's gorgeous, too.
No.
The daughter had a nose job and she had her mother's nose.
Evidently it was a honker.
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
You were saying I don't know what I'm saying.
All I know is I've waited all my life to find someone like Stan.
That's my fiancÃ©.
I know.
You do?
I know how you feel.
No, you don't.
See, I've never been married before, except to my career.
I guess that's why I feel so insecure about being a wife.
I want to be a good wife.
You're really crazy about the guy.
Head over heels in love.
I feel like a teenager.
He's smart, he's funny and the best lover I've ever had.
You haven't slept around much, have you?
I beg your pardon?
Nothing.
Popcorn?
Oh, no.
No, thanks.
So, you think he might still be in love with his ex-wife?
They're still good friends.
I mean, he talks about her all the time.
"Dorothy" this, "Dorothy" that.
What if she decides she wants him back?
If she's as great as you say she is, and no doubt she is, well, possibly in a weak moment, she might think she wants him back, but then maybe she'd think of the two of you together and what a nice person you seem to be, how he loves you and how much you love him and I think she'd realize that her time with him was over, and she'd let go graciously and wish him well.
In fact, I think that's exactly what she'd do.
No, she wouldn't.
Yes, she would.
No, she wouldn't.
Yes, she would.
How can you be so sure?
I'm a Leo.
We're all very sure of ourselves.
Well, it looks like I've got a wedding to go to.
I'm going to a wedding myself.
Mind if I walk with you?
Not at all.
You're a very wise person.
What did you say your name was?
I didn't.
Well, I really enjoyed talking with you.
I hope we meet again soon.
Believe me, we will.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Oh, morning, Ma.
You sleep OK?
No.
I got up in the middle of the night and there was a puddle in my bed.
Do you know how relieved I was to find out the roof was leaking?
Oh, hi, Rose.
Is the ceiling in your room leaking too?
No, Dorothy.
I just finished milking the cow I keep in my closet.
Gee, with only three hours' sleep, I can be as bitchy as you.
I'm sorry.
Look, we have to do something about the roof.
It's getting worse.
Forget it.
Blanche'll wait for the ceiling to cave in on her before she'll do anything.
Blanche, listen, we have to talk about the roof.
Dorothy, I already called the repairman.
Last night the damn ceiling caved in on my bedroom.
Knocked the Zorro mask right out of poor Ed Rosen's hand.
That must the roofer.
Sid LaBass.
You called about your roof.
Yes, come in.
Yeah.
Wait a sec.
I think I stepped in something.
That's good enough.
Mr. LaBass, I want to thank you for coming on such short notice.
You're lucky I came at all.
I got a horrible cold.
I was so dizzy, I lost my balance getting out of bed.
I guess my equilibrium's shot.
Well, I'm sure you'll feel better once you're up on the roof.
Well, I don't think I need to go up there.
I could see it was a goner when I drove up.
Oh, Sid!
Well, can't you patch it up or something?
Yeah, I could patch it up, but that won't stop more leaks when it rains again.
What are you trying to say, Sid?
You couldn't follow that?
She has trouble following Murder, She Wrote.
How much is a new roof going to cost, Sid?
Ten thou.
Well, how much is a patch job?
Oh, a couple of hundred.
Can I use your phone?
I gotta make a call.
Yeah, go ahead.
We have to discuss this.
Dorothy, we don't have $10,000.
We can barely afford a patch job.
Well, what are we gonna do?
Go without a roof?
Maybe we can talk Sid into letting us pay in installments.
Oh, that's a great idea.
He's a reasonable man.
I don't see why he wouldn't go for it.
OK.
A new roof it is.
Look, I said that payment was due today, not next Thursday.
That check better be on my desk tomorrow or you'll regret it, believe me.
Understand?
All right.
I'll talk to you later, Dad.
Oh, what have we decided?
Patch job.
Fine.
I'll do what I can.
Well, goodbye.
Where are you going?
It's my day to volunteer at the hospital.
Oh, it's really sweet of you to volunteer.
I like charity work.
Besides, I've got my eye on an eligible doctor for Dorothy.
I hope he likes charitable work too.
Listen, Dorothy, I'm going to an art show tomorrow night.
I always meet eligible men at galleries.
Why don't you come with me?
Can I come too, Blanche?
Sure.
I think it's gonna be a great show.
It's featuring the work of Mr. Jasper DeKimmel.
You ever heard of him?
I'm not sure.
Has he ever done anything in velvet?
Jasper DeKimmel's art hangs in museums all over the country, Rose.
Some of his paintings are worth thousands of dollars.
Here.
This is a DeKimmel on this brochure for the exhibit.
Hm.
I don't get it.
This kind of art does nothing for me.
You have to open your mind to new perceptions.
This is nonrepresentational art.
I work in a museum, so I understand these things.
Now, for instance, this slash of color of red across the bottom, well, that represents the setting sun.
And this jagged blue line, now, that signifies the ocean.
Then this spot of orange up here in the corner, that stands for the planets and man's eternal struggle against nature and the elements.
No, it doesn't.
That's where I put my Creamsicle down this afternoon when I answered the phone.
See?
It rubs right off.
Didn't I tell you it was gonna be special?
There's nothing but beautiful people here.
I'm glad they didn't make us check Dorothy with the coats.
Look, Ma, I think I look pretty damn good tonight.
Is it really necessary for you to constantly put me down?
I'm sorry, pussycat.
You're right.
From now on I'm gonna be a more supportive mother.
You look nice tonight.
You look better than a lot of other women here.
Like like her, for instance.
Oh, thanks, Ma.
By the way, that's a man.
Hey, that's not my fault.
Girls, look, a mime.
Oh, I just love a mime.
It's all on account of my Uncle Gustav.
He was a coal mimer.
You mean a coal miner.
No, a coal mimer.
He had a bad back and he didn't want to lose his medical benefits, so every morning he'd go down the shaft and pretend to work.
Hey.
Hey!
Why are you wearing makeup?
So your mother won't be embarrassed?
Honey, he won't pay any attention to you, no matter what you do.
Oh, yeah?
Hey, fella, your fly is open.
Girls, girls, look.
"Self-portrait by Jasper DeKimmel".
Dorothy, that picture has three noses.
Oh, I'm so glad that you find my self-portrait so interesting.
You're him.
Yes.
Gee, out of three noses, why did you keep the biggest?
All the galleries make the same mistake.
They've hung it upside down.
Oh, then those aren't noses.
Whoa!
Well, Mr. DeKimmel, I find your work absolutely riveting.
Well, so do I. I'm just not sure I understand it.
No, of course you don't.
If you had any real grasp of color, you certainly wouldn't have worn those shoes with that dress.
Oh, now, just a minute here, Mr. DeKimmel.
I see no reason for you to be insulting my friend Rose, or her shoes.
Oh, my lord!
Look at those things.
Well, the Pilgrims landed in nicer shoes.
Yes, do forgive me, ladies.
My nerves get a bit jangled at these events.
Perhaps you'd care to discuss one of my paintings.
That would be lovely.
Good.
Now, shall we start here?
Now, do you see how I echo Monet with my brush strokes?
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Do you see how I show darkness with single points of light?
Oh, yes.
Yes.
And do you see how I convey humor with my cycle of blues and grays?
Oh, yes.
Yes.
Yes.
You're idiots.
The only humor here is my own, at your great stupidity.
This picture no more echoes Monet than any of you echo a beauty queen.
And you will waste no more of my time.
Oh, yeah?
Go easy on him, Rose.
What a terrible man.
I know.
But let's not let him ruin our evening.
We can still enjoy all this art.
Dorothy's right.
Oh, look.
Two more mimes pretending to carry something.
I'm gonna have some fun with them.
Uh  They weren't mimes, were they?
Come on.
Rose, hurry, please!
These were the only towels I could find.
Put 'em around the bucket in case the leak spreads.
Wait a minute, Rose.
Is that my Cabana Club beach towel you have there?
Is it this one with the naked man and woman in the waves?
Yes, that's it.
You can't use this towel.
Blanche, Blanche, it's an emergency.
We'll replace it next week.
Oh, no, you cannot replace this towel.
There are too many fond memories attached to this towel.
Please.
I am in no mood to hear about the parade of endless sexual encounters that you have experienced up and down the Florida coastline, with only this towel between your hot flesh and the cold, wet sand.
I brought my son Skippy home from the hospital in this towel, Dorothy.
You're lying, Blanche.
Damn, you're good.
It wasn't all up and down the coast.
It was only Fort Lauderdale during spring break.
Give me the towel.
Oh!
I just hate that Sid LaBass.
It's not Sid's fault.
He told us patching the roof wouldn't work.
Let's face it, we're gonna have to come up with the money for a new roof.
Oh, it's $10,000, Dorothy.
How are we gonna come up with $10,000?
Well, I hate to do it, but I do have a couple of thousand in stock that I could cash in.
Well, I guess I could close up my Christmas club.
How much is that?
Let's see.
We're in January.
So this would be week three.
Then I have a retirement account that's about four thousand.
OK, I can borrow on my life insurance.
That should bring us close, huh?
It's settled.
We're gonna call Sid and tell him to go ahead with the new roof.
OK.
Oh, Ma, you will not believe what a terrible day we've been having.
What are you telling me for?
You think I'm hiding Father Flanagan under here?
I got my own problems.
What's wrong, Ma?
Today was the worst day ever at a hospital, not counting the unfortunate mistake Dr. Feldman made during my gall bladder surgery.
You ever tried passing a sponge?
What happened, Sophia?
I got stuck with the meanest patient in this history of medicine.
I mean, just because a person has two weeks to live, doesn't mean he has to be cranky.
Come on, Ma.
The man is dying.
I mean, have some sympathy.
You met this DeKimmel character.
You try having sympathy for a guy like that.
DeKimmel?
You mean Jasper DeKimmel?
That's right.
You got it.
Pablo Personality.
Oh, girls, listen to me, when a famous artist like Jasper DeKimmel dies, the value of his work doubles, sometimes even triples.
You know what that means?
Sure.
It means if he dies, those crummy pictures of his will be worth a fortune.
He'll have more money than he'll know what to do with.
You almost got it, Rose.
They're gonna auction off some of Jasper DeKimmel's art this week.
With a piece of inside information like this, we could make a killing buying an original DeKimmel.
Then we could sell the painting and pay for the roof and still have money to spare.
To buy whatever we want.
Oh, now, wait a minute.
Hold on, here.
Hold on.
Come on.
We're behaving like vultures, like beasts of prey.
I mean, girls, come on.
DeKimmel is a dying man.
Do we do we really want to profit from his misfortune?
It would be immoral.
We'd hate ourselves.
What time's the auction?
Eight o'clock.
We'd better get there by 7:30.
We want to get good seats.
Ma, what are you doing in here?
The searchlights were out so I tunneled out of my room with a spoon.
I couldn't sleep so I'm having some tea.
If that's OK with you, Prime Minister Botha?
Oh, I couldn't sleep either.
I had a terrible nightmare.
Was it the dream where you're a lonely old woman and your family doesn't want you so they put you in a home and never come to see you or take you out on holidays?
That wasn't my dream.
Oh, yeah, right.
That was my life.
Ma, please, for the hundredth time, Shady Pines was a beautiful retirement village.
Sure, sure.
And Attica's known for its topnotch tennis facilities.
What are you guys doing up?
Conducting a sÃ©ance to contact Liberace.
We couldn't sleep.
Why else would we be up at 4am?
I couldn't sleep either, but I think it was something I ate before bed.
What did you eat?
Nothing out of the ordinary.
A handful of Snowcaps, a couple of Devil Dogs, some Oreos.
Oh, yeah, and a Ho Ho chopped up in a bowl of fruit cocktail with heavy syrup.
Couldn't sleep?
I'm surprised you didn't try to kill the mayor of San Francisco.
Good morning, girls.
Boy, do I feel wonderful.
I just had the best night's sleep.
Blanche, it's four in the morning.
What?
Oh, for heaven's sake.
I don't believe it.
Do you know what happens if I don't spend eight hours in bed?
Iranian guys write their cousins back home and tell them not to come?
No, I simply cannot function the next day.
But I always sleep like a baby.
How could this have happened?
None of us could sleep, and we all know the reason why.
Why?
You are nothing if not consistent, Rose.
Thank you, Dorothy, but hot water and oat bran every morning takes most of the credit.
No, I know what you meant, Dorothy.
You mean the reason we can't sleep is 'cause we feel guilty about profiting from Jasper DeKimmel's impending death.
I feel creepy every time I think about it.
Oh, me too.
Look, why don't we just forget the whole thing?
What?
No one's calling anything off.
It's not our fault the man is sick.
It's not our fault the man is weaker by the hour.
It's not our fault he needs a rare blood transfusion.
Did you say a rare blood transfusion?
Yeah, I overheard the doctors talking.
In a day or two he'll be plant food.
It still doesn't feel right.
Let me tell you a story.
Picture it.
Sardinia, 1932.
I thought these stories of yours always took place in Sicily.
Can't a person go away for the weekend?
Anyway, I'm on a tour of the great caper factories of Sardinia.
I was a kooky kid going through my piccata period.
A wedge of lemon and a smart answer for everything.
Anyway, I was I was slicing an onion when suddenly this big basil tree-- Ma, what the hell are you talking about?
You're not making any sense.
I was hoping the late hour would help to mask that.
I don't have a story about taking advantage of a dead guy for money.
I got a great story about a Moroccan and a monkey, but that really comes under the heading of lust.
I'm really confused.
Look, life is tough.
I'm not happy that a fellow human being is passing away, but it's out of our control.
If we don't make a few bucks on this deal, somebody else will.
All right.
We're all in.
Fine.
Welcome to the George Bush era.
Me, me, me.
Now remember, girls, as far as anybody else here is concerned, Jasper DeKimmel is in perfect health.
Right.
I'm surprised Jasper's not here tonight.
He never misses one of these auctions.
Well, it's not because he's dying.
Girls, the auction's about to start.
Ladies and gentlemen, the first item before you tonight is a fine example of Greco-Roman statuary.
May I have an opening bid, please, of 20?
I have 20.
Do I hear 25?
Why are these statues always of naked men?
Oh, you see, Rose, the Greeks and Romans always sculpted men.
They admired the beauty of the male form.
Its sinewy, muscled hardness, its rippling loins, its chiseled buttocks.
My, it's getting hot in here.
It certainly is.
I have 25.
Do I hear 30?
Rose, you just made a bid.
How?
You did this.
I have 35.
Thank you.
Who'll give me Great, Dorothy.
Relax, Blanche.
It's only $30.
No, it's $30,000.
$30,000?
Just for doing this?
I have 35.
Who'll give me 40?
What did you do that for?
You'll need both hands to pray he gets 40.
Bid is 35.
Going once.
Oh, no!
Going twice.
Please.
Oh, thank God.
Going once, going twice, sold.
Look, girls, here comes the painting.
All right, now remember, Next we have "Community Property" by Jasper DeKimmel.
A small piece, but one which will be worth many times its current value some day.
Like tomorrow.
Keeping a secret just isn't your strong suit, is it, Rose?
Now, girls, we don't want to be overeager.
No.
Let's be very cool and laid-back.
We don't want to do anything to heat up the bidding.
Who'll open the bidding at 5,000?
One of us at a time.
I have 5,000.
Do I have 6,000?
Six.
Who'll give me 65?
Now, watch how I do this.
If you really play it cool, you can scare off the other bidders.
Uh, 6500.
I have 65.
Who'll make it seven?
I have seven.
Who'll give me 75?
My turn.
75.
I have 75.
Who'll give me 8,000?
I have eight.
Rose, what are you doing?
You just bid against us.
Oh, I guess I got carried away with the cool part.
Oh, Rose, I could just smack you.
I have 85.
Oh, give me that thing.
I have nine.
Oh!
Going once, going twice Unless you ladies would like to pay more.
No!
Sold.
$9,000.
All right, come on.
Let's go call Ma.
Ma, we got it.
We own a DeKimmel.
Even though he was a terrible man, I feel guilty.
Find out where we send flowers.
Send flowers to yourself.
The yutz is gonna make it.
They found a donor with the rare blood type he needed.
Gee, you save a guy's life, all you get is apple juice and a cookie?
Dorothy?
What did she say, honey?
What did she say?
Dorothy.
Oh, girls, let's stop sitting around here moping.
Now, that painting isn't so bad.
If you stare at it long enough, it almost looks good.
I tell myself that every week after thirtysomething.
It still gives me a headache.
The important thing is that we didn't do anything to feel guilty about.
That's right.
Ma saved a human life.
Even if it did put us in debt and even if he was the most miserable, contemptible slug on the face of this earth.
Look who's here, the runner-up.
I'm here with my crew to get started.
Sid, there's been a change of plan.
We can't afford that new roof anymore.
I don't get it.
You can't afford a roof, but you can afford a painting like that?
That's a DeKimmel, isn't it?
Yeah.
That repulsive trash is an original DeKimmel.
I have always wanted an original DeKimmel.
Don't you love the style, the technique, the use of color?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'd give anything to own a painting like that.
How about that painting for a new roof?
You're kidding.
Of course she's kidding.
That painting means everything to me.
I could never part with it.
Sophia!
Are you crazy?
Crazy about DeKimmel.
Ma'am, would you be insulted if I made you an offer for that painting?
Please!
I'm insulted by that shirt you're wearing.
That doesn't mean we can't do business.
Talk to me, Sidney.
Well, what about a new roof with a five-year warranty?
And $2500.
In cash?
No, in pistachio nuts.
Of course.
Cash, today.
Tomorrow the price goes up.
DeKimmel isn't getting any younger.
Well, $2500 seems a little steep.
$3,000.
You ticked me off.
Now you're watching a real artist at work.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Hi, Ma.
Boy, am I steamed!
They took Pat Sajak off Wheel of Fortune.
Well, that's because he has his own late-night talk show now.
Oh, yeah, right.
The man spins a big wooden wheel for eight years, suddenly he's discussing dÃ©tente with Henry Kissinger.
What else happened lately?
Mike Tyson hosting Masterpiece Theatre?
Ma, why are you so cranky today?
I'm not cranky.
I'm gassy.
I had one of those Weight Watchers broccoli au gratins for lunch.
Boy, that stuff's murder.
I'm surprised Lynn Redgrave has a friend in the world.
Hi, Rose.
Hey, how was football practice?
Terrible.
It's the laziest team I've ever seen in my life.
They didn't bust their tackles, didn't crack their blocks.
They played like a bunch of babies.
Coach, you dropped your whistle.
Oh.
Thanks, Billy, that was very nice of you.
Now you two boys run along home.
OK.
Bye.
Billy?
Yes?
I said run!
Move it, you little pantywaist!
On the double!
Rose!
Rose, take it easy.
You're pushing them too hard.
Honey, they're only kids.
You're right.
I've just been under so much pressure.
I never would have volunteered if I'd known the work that was involved.
I need help.
Mostly with your lipstick.
Emmett Kelly applied makeup with more finesse.
Boy, she's really cranky.
And you don't want to know why.
Dorothy, I just had a great idea.
Why don't you become my assistant?
Oh, Rose, forget it.
Forget it.
I don't want to get involved in sports with you.
No, Rose, you're too competitive.
You just take all the fun out of it.
Not anymore, Dorothy, really.
Believe me, all I care about is that these kids have a really good time.
Well, all right.
I mean, if you really mean it, you can count me in.
Oh, great.
Oh, with your help, Dorothy, we'll kick their butts.
We'll chew 'em up and spit 'em out.
We'll make 'em eat dirt for breakfast.
Because breakfast is the most important meal of the day.
Hi, girls.
How's it going?
How was practice, Rose?
The boys OK?
No time to chat now.
I'll see y'all later.
Bye.
Blanche, you're meeting him again, aren't you?
Who, Dorothy?
Who?
Who else?
Tom Gallagher.
Blanche, you're too good for him.
I will never understand what it is you have against Tom Gallagher.
He is a shallow insensitive snob who stands you up constantly.
Dorothy, there happens to be another side to Tom Gallagher that most people don't see.
What is it?
I don't know.
I'm one of those people.
But as long as he doesn't give me a dirty look when I order lobster, I don't care.
Blanche Oh, all right, all right, maybe he's not perfect, but I happen to be in a little dating slump right now.
I'm just happier having a man who isn't perfect than looking around for one who is.
That's what Bush told everyone when he was choosing a vice president.
Hey, Blanche.
I didn't see you.
Uh, listen Ernie, could you freshen my drink?
Oh, sure.
Look Put some extra ice cubes in it this time.
OK, Blanche I don't know why you're always so stingy with your ice cubes.
They are free, aren't they?
Blanche Ernie, you notice how I keep interrupting you?
It's because I don't want to hear what you're gonna tell me.
He called and canceled again, didn't he?
Sorry, Blanche.
He told me to buy you anything you liked.
Oh, really?
Well, then, get out your phone book and open it to the jewelry section.
It's no fun being stood up, is it?
Listen, mister, if you're looking for a quick score because you think I'm down, then you can just think again.
As a matter of fact, I was looking for a little sympathy.
Got stood up myself tonight.
Really?
Cross my heart.
What's left of it.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm just so darn angry.
My name's Blanche.
John.
John Quinn.
How do you do?
I don't know about you, but I sure feel too old to be stood up.
You're not the only one.
This is the fourth time that man has canceled.
He found somebody better, that's all.
Oh, Blanche.
Yes, he did.
Somebody younger and prettier.
Blanche, it can't be.
Well, maybe you're right.
Somebody younger and as pretty.
I think tonight may be the night I finally learned my lesson.
No more dates for a long time.
You mean that?
I do.
Well, all right, then.
I'm with you.
No more dates.
Here's looking at you.
Cheers.
Oh, I'm sorry I'm so sorry.
Did I get you?
No, no, I'm fine.
But here, let me help you.
Thanks.
This is embarrassing.
I gotta be the clumsiest guy on earth.
No.
You don't happen to know a good dry cleaner, do you?
Oh, only the best.
You know Andre's on Elm?
Sure.
Well, Andre takes his clothes to this place.
I'll write it down for you.
Thanks.
I'm glad it was red wine and not white.
Why?
White's easier to get out.
I know, but I spilled red meat on this jacket at lunch, and I wouldn't want your dry cleaner to think I was gauche.
Here you go.
Oh, thanks.
I think I'll run along now.
Nice meeting you, Mr. John Quinn.
Thank you.
Same here, Blanche, uh Devereaux.
Good night.
Good night.
Blanche?
Yes?
I know you're gonna think I'm a hypocrite for this, but is there any way I could call you for dinner?
Only one way I can think of.
What?
By looking at that napkin.
My number's on it.
Good night.
Can I get something else for you, John?
No, I think I'll call it a night, Ernie.
OK.
Take care.
Thanks, Ernie.
Tommy Turner.
Don't miss any meals, Turner.
If you're less than 70, you can't play.
Uh, Freddy Leone.
Hey, Leone, try to remember lasagna was not meant to go in a sandwich.
Uh, last but not least, Billy Haskell.
Wait a minute, wait, wait, wait.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
How much does he weigh now, Ma?
Aww.
Sorry, Coach Rose.
I tried.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Well, you said to take the book And study.
Study, study, study, study.
No game Saturday, Billy.
I'm sorry.
Everybody, I'll see you at practice tomorrow.
Thanks a lot, Rose.
You just taught a bunch of eight-year-old boys that it's more important to win than to play by the rules.
Big deal!
Two pounds?
He's our best player.
If Billy doesn't play, the team can't win.
Rose, rules were made for people like Billy.
Little bodies don't like it when big bodies fall on them.
Which is why Raymond Burr never married.
Girls, quick.
I need some advice.
Wear half as much makeup and twice as much underwear.
Take it as a standing recommendation.
Sophia, I need advice on these earrings.
Are they dressy enough for a really nice dinner?
Oh, Blanche, don't tell me you're seeing Tom Gallagher again.
No, I am not.
I'm seeing that man I told you about I met in the bar - John Quinn.
Just got off the phone with him.
He asked you out for tonight?
Yes!
I know it's a little quick, but when Blanche Devereaux wants a man, she does not stand on ceremony.
Or the floor.
You seem pretty excited about this date.
Something tells me this man is just about perfect.
John is everything Tom wasn't.
He's smart, mature, responsible.
And on time.
Would you girls keep him entertained?
I want to make sure I look perfect before he sees me.
Hello.
Hi, I'm John Quinn.
Hi, I'm Rose, Blanche's roommate.
Hi, Rose.
Won't you come in?
Could you, uh, give me a hand?
Well, sure.
That's, uh That's OK.
I'll use this.
Uh, come in.
Thank you.
Oh, how do you do, John?
I'm Dorothy.
I'm Blanche's other roommate.
Hello, Dorothy.
And I'm her gorgeous Hey, how many chances do I get?
Hello, John.
Well, how do I look?
Blanche Am I just the most adorable thing you ever saw?
Blanche Are you blinded by my beauty?
Blanche!
Oh, my God.
Want a glass of water to wash down your foot?
Blanche, was there something you didn't realize the other night?
Oh, you mean about you being blind, you mean?
Oh, goodness, no, of course I knew that.
I'm not blind.
Not that there's anything wrong in that.
C-C-Course, there's nothing so good about it, either.
Could we just go?
Great.
What restaurant are we headed to?
Harvey's at the shore.
Do you know it?
No, I don't.
Oh, you'll love it.
It has a gorgeous view.
In this formation you're lined up in a wishbone with the U-back in motion.
Any questions so far?
I've got a question, Coach Rose.
Am I an X or an O?
You're an O, Freddy.
The other team are the X's, and you're all O's.
It's easy to remember.
It's the number of points you scored this season.
Now, the tight end decoys, so it looks like we're running a draw play, then he slips into a soft spot in the zone over the middle, the flanker fakes a screen then runs a reverse behind the halfback, which gives the quarterback two options For God's sake, Rose, Eisenhower used less chalk planning D-day.
OK.
Well, then, let's just talk about a few things that happened in the last game.
Nobody blocked this X. Billy could have blocked him.
Well, maybe Billy could have, but Billy couldn't play, and we all know why.
I don't want to mention any names.
Follow my eyes.
OK, that's it for practice today.
Everybody get a good night's sleep.
Coach Dorothy, can Billy and I get weighed together and we divide it?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Nice try.
You're beginning to think like a fourth-grader already.
I told you it wouldn't work.
Happy, Dorothy?
Thanks to you, we don't stand a chance in tomorrow's game without our star player.
Rose, listen, I am getting sick and tired of being made out to be a villain simply because I play by the rules.
Relax.
It'll all be over tomorrow.
If I make it that far.
I think I caught something practicing out in the rain.
So did I. Gee, I hope none of the boys caught it.
Don't worry about it.
Those boys can't catch anything.
I've seen them practice.
Hi, girls.
Oh, hi.
How did your date with John go?
Oh, perfect.
Dinner and the symphony.
You must be really serious.
You've seen him every night this week.
You're a lucky woman, Blanche.
Your guy John is just the type I always figured was perfect for my Dorothy.
Oh, he sure is.
He's smart, he's sophisticated.
I was talking blind.
I'll get it.
Hello.
Well, hello there.
How have you been?
Yes, as a matter of fact, I am free tonight.
Well, I would just love to meet for drinks.
Seven is perfect.
Bye.
Blanche, don't tell me that you were talking to Tom Gallagher.
And what if I was?
You have plans with John tonight.
Then obviously I'll just have to cancel.
Blanche, I can't believe this!
You two don't really expect me to limit myself to one man, now, do you?
Well, when it's one terrific man, yes.
I guess you two don't know me very well.
Blanche, this is the best relationship you've been in in the last five years.
Why do you want to ruin it?
Because it's never gonna work.
Why?
Because the man is blind.
Now, would the two of you please keep your noses out of my business?
Blanche, you know something?
When it comes to other people, you're the one who's blind!
Here we go, Dorothy.
Two bowls of Sophia's homemade remedy.
Oh, Rose, this isn't gonna work.
We have the flu.
Well, we have to at least give it a try.
Today's the big game.
We can't let those kids down.
Ugh, what is in this?
Red peppers, oregano, garlic, chicken fat and lard.
Sophia swears it works every time.
Now eat up.
Oh, this is disgusting.
What's disgusting?
Your cure for the flu.
Hey, that remedy's been in our family for generations.
And it always works?
Always.
Of course, I never saw anyone eat it before.
Usually, you just throw a glop on the vaporizer.
Oh, Rose, this is - this is hopeless.
We're never gonna feel well enough to coach that game today.
Oh, I guess we'll have to forfeit.
But it's gonna break those kids' hearts.
Forfeit?
You mean quit?
You can't do that, Rose.
No member of my family ever quits.
Sophia, I'm not a member of your family.
Pretend, Rose.
I'm going for a moment here.
You never saw a Frank Capra film?
I'm taking over.
Wish me luck.
Ma, you don't know anything about football.
Please.
What's to know?
You hit a guy, you grab the pigskin, you run like crazy.
It's like shopping in Sicily.
Hi, Sophia.
Let's roll, Freddy.
We got a game to win.
That was really a sweet thing for Sophia to do.
I know.
But if she loses, I'll punch her stinking heart out.
Oh, good, I'm so glad you girls are here.
Listen, I acted so stupid last night.
I apologize.
I need to talk.
Why, Blanche?
No matter what we say, you're gonna end up doing exactly what you want.
We told you last night you were pushing away a terrific guy, and you did, didn't you?
Yes, but you don't understand why I pushed John away.
You told us.
Because he's blind.
Yes, because he's blind.
But you don't know what it meant, dating a blind man.
John took away the one thing I'd always felt secure about - my looks.
How do I always attract men?
By being pretty, by acting sexy, showing a little leg.
With John, those things don't work.
I spent half the time I was with him thinking, "What in the world does this man like about me"?
So you went back to Tom because you know what he likes.
Yes, but the whole time I was with him I was miserable, 'cause I wanted to be with John.
Well, then tell all this to John.
I guess that is my only choice.
Yes, I'm gonna look him up tonight and I'm gonna patch things up.
Oh, thank you.
I'm so glad we're friends again.
Oh, honey, of course we are.
And by the way, I have never asked you what it is y'all have.
Oh, we're not sure.
All we know is it makes your skin blotchy, and your eyes puffy and your cheeks swollen.
And you get heart palpitations.
Good thing for those palpitations, otherwise you might never have known you even had it.
OK, here's the game plan.
We keep it on the ground.
Then, when they're used to it on the ground, we attack them through the air.
I've used the same formula for 60 years of lovemaking.
Trust me - it works.
OK, everybody, hit the field.
Yeah!
You're upset 'cause you can't play, aren't you?
Still could, if you let me.
Aren't you still 2 pounds below the limit?
Yeah.
Boy, I hate being small.
Hey, being small isn't all bad.
Take it from someone who knows.
You mean you?
You see Billy Barty sitting here?
There are big advantages to being small.
One, you never outgrow your clothes.
Two, you seldom bump your head.
Three, the world thinks you're cute.
You think Danny DeVito got to be famous with his good looks?
There's nothing wrong with being small, kid, but it is wrong to cheat.
If you learn in life to follow the rules and play fair, you'll be heads above the crowd.
You know, Sophia, all of a sudden I feel so much better.
I had a feeling at your age a good clichÃ© would work.
Now eat this.
What is it?
That's a meatball and pepper sandwich.
If that doesn't put the weight on you, nothing will.
OK, get suited up.
All right!
Well, don't just stand there.
What?
It's your perfume, Blanche.
It gives you away every time.
Oh, goodness.
For a blind man, you're certainly observant.
Have a seat.
Thank you.
Your secretary told me you were meeting somebody here, so I won't keep you.
I just thought we ought to talk.
Blanche, if you've come to apologize for last night, I understand.
Well, I'm-I'm not sure you do, John.
I like you very much.
Problem is, I just don't know what it is you like about me.
See, I'm used to men liking me for my looks - at least partly - and you don't.
I sure don't.
As a matter of fact, I'm glad I never have to look at you.
What?
That's right.
You see, when I like somebody, I get to make up what they look like for myself, and when I like somebody a lot, I make up a pretty nice picture.
Would it be rude of me to ask just what that picture is you have of me?
Oh, well You make me laugh, so you got a terrific smile.
Yes.
You're smart and thoughtful, so you've got beautiful eyes.
Yes.
And you're a music lover, so you've got a big behind.
Ye- No.
Just wanted to see if you were paying attention.
I think you're just terrific.
I feel awful stupid about last night.
Don't, Blanche.
I know it's not easy.
I'd love it if we could make plans for next week.
My treat.
How about if I call you Monday?
Great.
John?
Elaine, hello.
Hi.
Blanche, this is Elaine.
Well, hello, Elaine.
I was just leaving.
John, you and Elaine have a good time tonight.
Oh, and just so you'll know, it looks like Elaine here is an even bigger music lover than I am.
Oh.
Blanche, hi.
Did everything work out with John?
Oh, yes.
We're getting together next week.
I thought you two would be in bed.
We just got out.
Ugh, feels like we spent the whole day in bed.
You say that like it's a bad thing.
Make way for the victors.
You won the big game?
No, Rose, we lost, and we all changed our names to Victor.
Of course we won.
Now it's time for ice cream.
Yeah!
Good going, guys!
Ma, wait a minute, wait a minute.
Ma.
Did you let Billy play?
Billy?
Billy Little boy, brown hair.
She knows who he is.
Uh, he played a little.
Ma, that was illegal.
Was.
I gave him a sandwich so he'd make weight.
Unfortunately, on the first play it gave him a cramp, and he had to sit out, but they won it without him.
I knew they could, because of all the discipline I taught them.
Baloney.
It's because of the team spirit that I taught them.
You're both wrong.
It was the "Statue of Mussolini" play I taught theme.
What's that?
Everybody piles on the star quarterback on the first play, and then he's out for the rest of the game.
Ma, Ma, that is a mean, underhanded, despicable thing to do.
So was World War II.
We're talkin' about Mussolini.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Gin.
Sophia, we're playing hearts.
I know.
I felt like drinking some.
If I'm gonna get through a boring Saturday night with you two, I'll need a buzz.
Ma, why are you so cranky?
I had plans with Mildred tonight.
She waited until the last minute to call and cancel it.
The woman had a heart attack.
It wasn't massive.
Girls, does this look OK?
Oh, fine.
A little overdressed for a quiet evening at home.
Oh, Blanche, didn't you hear?
Rose has a date.
A date?
Yes.
I met him briefly at the counseling center and he asked me out to dinner.
Well, Rose has a date and I don't.
What are the odds of something like this happening?
There's probably a better chance of getting struck by lightning in a house you won from Ed McMahon.
Blanche, I'm sure it's a fluke that nobody called you for a date.
They must have painted the men's room walls at the Pizza Hut.
Well, there must be something wrong with Rose's date.
There has to be.
I bet he's an airhead, or a mutant, or an insurance salesman.
Oh, that's it.
Well, Rose, you and your geek have fun.
And you said she wouldn't take it well, Dorothy.
Oh!
Sophia, I forgot to give you this letter.
Oh, from Sicily.
A gift from Cousin Vito.
A feather.
That's a message of some kind, isn't it?
What are you babbling about?
Don't play dumb, with me, Ma.
Everything from Sicily means something.
A black rose means a family member is dying.
A white carnation means a newborn is on the way.
A dead rabbit means, "My husband knows.
Get out of town".
Knows what?
The score to South Pacific, Rose.
Relax, Dorothy.
Maybe Vito just wants a handmade pillow for Christmas.
It means nothing.
Who cares?
Argh!
Sorry.
I was just so excited about this lovely gift.
Hi, Ernie.
Hi, Rose.
Ernie, I want you to meet my friends.
This is Dorothy and Blanche and Sophia.
Pleasure.
Everyone, this is Ernie Faber.
I'm sorry I'm late, Rose.
I got tied up in court.
What are you charged with?
Nothing.
I'm a corporate attorney.
Damn!
So, tell us, Ernie, have you ever been married?
I'm divorced.
Oh.
Was the breakup caused by your drinking problem?
I don't have a drinking problem.
Were you cheating on your wife?
What is this?
A Barbara Walters Special?
I guess the two of you want to get going.
It was a pleasure meeting you all.
Good night, now.
Have fun.
Bye-bye.
Well, he's perfect.
He's absolutely perfect.
I cannot believe a man like that would be interested in Rose.
Well, I guess he's not perfect after all.
That's right, Dorothy.
Thank you.
I feel so much better.
We're living with Robin Givens.
Morning, Ma.
OK.
Good morning.
Ma, what is going on?
Ever since you got that feather in the mail, you've been acting like a spy.
I'm surprised you didn't check to see if someone was hiding out in the broom closet.
Broom closet, right.
This is ridiculous.
Dorothy, she's right.
I know for a fact that two people can fit into the broom closet with room left over for a medium-sized cold-cut platter.
Now, what's going on, Ma?
OK.
I hoped I could spare you this, Dorothy, but it's best you know what's going on.
It's about Sonny Venuchio as in the famous Venuchio vendetta.
I never heard of that.
Who asked you?
This is a speech, not a quiz.
It began when your great-grandfather, Nicodemo, was run down by Marco Venuchio's milk wagon.
He ran him down in cold blood?
Very cold.
Grandpa was already dead.
Unfortunately, there was a gravediggers' strike, so the family was using him as a temporary scarecrow.
The high winds tipped him over and Marco used him as a speed bump.
But, Sophia, if it wasn't Marco's fault-- It doesn't have to be his fault.
It's a vendetta, not The People's Court.
Anyway, there's only one Venuchio alive today.
Sonny.
That feather from Vito meant he's somewhere down here in Miami, so now it's up to me to take care of him.
Oh, Ma.
Do you really expect us to believe that you're gonna go through with this?
Believe what you want.
Sicilians take these things very seriously.
You know what might happen if I didn't do my duty?
What?
Free swimming lessons with a cement kickboard.
Hi, girls.
Rose, honey, is something wrong?
No.
I'm just a little depressed.
Oh, come on now, Rose.
If there's something wrong, you can tell us.
Is it about Ernie?
He's lousy in bed.
I knew it!
I knew there was something wrong with him.
No, he's not lousy.
Well, I don't think he is.
Well, either he is or he isn't.
Well, I'm sure he's not.
Of course, I have no proof that he's not, but still, he's not.
I think.
I don't get it.
Neither does Rose.
You mean you've been seeing him for over a month and you two haven't done it?
He hasn't made one move.
There was the time we were out to dinner and I thought he was coming on a little strong all of a sudden, but it turned out he was looking for his napkin under the table.
What have you all been doing all this time?
How long can you make conversation?
Blanche, there is more to conversation than just: "Can I have a hanger for my pants, please"?
Oh, Ernie's not like that.
He's very special.
He's not the type of man who wants to hop into bed after just one date.
And this is one of his attributes?
Yes.
I love it.
In fact, I think I love him.
Oh, honey.
Rose, that's wonderful.
But I still can't understand why he hasn't even approached the subject of you know sex.
I mean, not that I'm in a hurry or anything but we have been dating a while now.
Honey, sometimes you have to stoke a man's fire a little bit.
Words of wisdom from the human torch.
Listen.
Rose, if he really means that much to you, and he feels the same way, things will happen naturally.
Yeah, but if you don't want to wait, there are other avenues you can take.
There are just dozens of ways to seduce a man, hundreds, maybe even thousands.
I think that you should forget the ones that involve swinging naked from a doorframe.
You need to get him in a romantic situation, Rose.
Why don't you ask him to take you away for the weekend?
I think we should probably try holding hands first.
Blanche has a point finally.
If he doesn't want to go away with you, then you'll know how he feels.
I'll get that.
That's probably Ernie.
Oh, I can't do it.
I can't ask him to go away with me.
I've never learned how to be aggressive.
Honey, it's as easy as riding a bicycle.
I never learned how to ride a bicycle.
It's as easy as falling off a bicycle.
Really?
Well, that is easy.
Thanks, Dorothy.
It was just a hunch.
Hi, Ernie.
Oh, Rose.
I'm really sorry.
I'm on my way to the office.
There's a small emergency.
Do you mind if we postpone our date?
I was gonna ask you-- I'd like to make this up to you.
I've been thinking How about we go away this weekend?
I know it's sudden, but I'd really like to take you somewhere special.
What do you say?
Well Yes.
That sounds wonderful.
That's great.
I'll call you later, Rose.
Looks like everything worked out after all.
Were you three listening to our conversation?
Absolutely not.
You know we would never eavesdrop.
They made me do it.
When I turn my hearing aid up to ten, I can hear a canary break wind in Lauderdale.
Oh, Rose, I'm having a wonderful time.
You're a lot of fun to be with.
Oh, I'm having a good time too.
I don't think I've had this much fun since I was a little girl back in St. Olaf.
I remember once when I was about ten You were about to tell a story.
Why did you stop?
Well, this is usually when Dorothy and Blanche interrupt me.
Anyway, I'd always go to the movies every Saturday afternoon with all my friends.
Oh, we'd have a ball.
The only problem was that our town theater was designed for silent movies.
They never put in a sound system?
No.
Luckily, our schoolteacher, Miss Sigerson, was an expert lipreader.
She'd do all the dialogue.
There were some problems sometimes.
Through most of Citizen Kane, we all thought everybody was looking for a rowboat.
Rose there's something I have to tell you.
Something I should have told you from the start.
What, Ernie?
What's wrong?
I was sort of hoping this weekend, this romantic setting, might help but it hasn't.
I was hoping that it might help me get over my problem.
What problem?
It's not easy for a man to say, Rose.
I'm impotent.
I see.
Well, in that case, why don't we see what's playing at the movies?
Yeah.
Is this the Venuchio residence?
It is?
Is Sonny Venuchio there?
He is?
Sorry, wrong number.
Sophia, does this still have to do with that vendetta business?
Blanche, don't even discuss it with her.
The whole thing is ridiculous.
Dorothy, this vendetta is a very real thing.
It goes to the root of my soul as a Sicilian..
If you don' wanna acknowledge it, that's your business.
Fine, Ma.
But I need a ride later.
I wanna go to confession.
They go easy on you if it's still just an impure thought.
Well, well, you got in pretty late last night.
I know.
So, tell us all about the big weekend.
And don't leave out a thing.
I want you to start with the sweet nothings he whispered in your ear.
Well, OK.
First, he said that I was a very attractive woman.
Yeah.
And then he said I was fun to be with.
Yeah.
And then he said he was impotent.
Urgh!
Impotent?
Are you sure?
Oh, Blanche, what would you have done?
Asked him to prove it?
I can't talk about this.
Of course you can.
Rose, We're your friends.
We're here to listen.
I mean, we've all spoken at one time or another about a sexual problem.
Not me.
It's not your fault, and it's not Ernie's.
I mean, we've all been with a man who couldn't perform.
Not me.
I just feel so so undesirable.
Oh, honey, we all have at some point.
I know, Blanche, not you.
I remember when Stanley and I were going through this.
We tried everything.
Relaxation techniques, hypnosis I fed the man so many oysters, when he passed a kidney stone, I had it appraised.
It was two years before he found a cure.
What was it?
A blonde stewardess with a butt that would have made Gandhi throw in the towel.
So, Rose, are you gonna stop seeing Ernie?
No, of course not.
Rose, how about you and Ernie seeing a sex therapist?
I suppose I could talk to Ernie.
Maybe we could make an appointment.
Well, sex therapy is one solution, but there are other ways.
Oh, Blanche, dessert toppings are not the answer.
I was talking about patience.
Rose, just tell Ernie that sex is not the most important part of a relationship.
Just ask anybody married to an Englishman.
I'm gonna call Ernie right now.
I think we have a lot to talk about.
OK, Dorothy.
I'm going for a walk.
If I don't come back, it's up to you to take care of Sonny Venuchio.
His address is on the table.
Ma, that's it.
Now, I want you to look at me and tell me this vendetta business is all a joke.
This vendetta business is all a joke.
Now I want you to look me in the eye and tell me you're not lying.
I'm not lying.
Sophia, it's for you.
He says his name is Tony the Hook.
Tell him I'll call him back.
What are you looking at?
He's my butcher.
Yeah, that's it.
My butcher.
How's your soufflÃ©, Rose?
Delicious.
I never did get the hang of making these.
There is nothing more frustrating than waiting for one of these suckers to rise and it just won't.
That's no reflection on you, Ernie.
I know why you called me, Rose.
I know why you wanted to have dinner.
You do?
You wanted to tell me that maybe we should stop seeing each other.
Ernie, that's not true.
Come on, Rose.
I mean, after all, you can't be happy with the way things are.
I mean, you're a healthy, active, sexy woman.
Well, I'm also a patient woman, Ernie.
I mean, really.
I'm probably the most patient person you know.
Go ahead.
Try to think of somebody else.
I'll wait.
Tell me honestly.
You don't think there's something lacking in this relationship?
No.
I think you're a kind, generous, caring man.
As far as the physical side goes, we'll just take things slow.
And if it turns out that we can't be anything more than just good friends, well, that's good enough for me.
I'm a lucky man to have found someone like you.
I feel the same way.
If you ask me, people rely too much on sex in relationships, anyway.
You're right.
I mean, what is sex, after all?
Two clunky old bodies thrashing around against each other.
Like animals.
You get all sweaty and flushed.
Your hair gets mussed.
You lose your breath.
You lose your earrings.
Your mouth waters.
Your nose runs.
Your heart races.
Your blood races.
Rose Say it, Ernie.
It's time, Rose.
Check, please!
Blanche, look at this picture.
A man's body was washed ashore on the beach last night.
Oh, how horrible.
And look at this.
It says: "A tan bamboo purse was found at the scene".
Do you know what that means?
The man was murdered on his way to a Peter Allen concert?
No.
It makes me think about Ma and that ridiculous vendetta.
I mean, if I didn't know Ma, I might actually consider Anybody seen my purse?
Oh, God.
Ma, how could you do this?
Relax.
I probably left it at Sonny's place.
Of course you did, right next to his body.
How did you know?
Ma!
It's all over the front page of today's paper.
Oh.
That's not Sonny.
That's a dead guy.
Of course he is, if you carried out that vendetta.
What are you talking about?
This was an '80s vendetta.
It was all symbolic.
You find the guy, drop a fish on his doorstep, boom, you wash your hands of the whole thing.
Ma, wait a minute.
If that's all you did, how come your purse is still over there?
Oh, well, maybe I did leave one thing out.
While I was giving Sonny the evil eye, I noticed he was kinda cute.
So, I decided to work in a little kiss of death too.
Well, that livened him up, and we spent a very pleasant afternoon.
Oh!
Ma, you are incredible.
Those were Sonny's words exactly.
Good morning.
Well, good morning.
Rose Nylund, you little devil.
Just look at you.
What?
Don't you get coy with me.
I can tell.
The rosy cheeks, the bright smile, the distant, not-quite-there expression.
She looks that way every day.
What's your point?
Rose has been with a man.
So what if I was with Ernie?
With Ernie?
Oh, oh, isn't that wonderful?
Oh, honey, congratulations!
I'm so happy for you.
Calm down, Blanche.
It was a roll in the hay, not a walk on the moon.
Oh, Ernie's the best thing that's happened to me in a long time.
I don't think I've been this happy with a man since Charlie.
I have to get ready.
We're going on a picnic today.
Oh, I don't believe this.
Hey, she didn't even tell us how it happened.
Same way it happened the last time you did it.
Of course, hairstyles may have changed since then.
I had a marvelous time tonight, Ernie.
So did I, Rose.
Rose, there's something very important I want to say to you.
OK.
I want you to know how much I appreciate all you've done.
After my marriage fell apart, I stopped being able to perform like a man should.
No, it's because of your warmth and understanding that I got through this.
I never thought I'd find happiness ever again.
Some marriages don't work out, but some do.
You're right, Rose.
And that's why I think that I can still patch things up with her.
What?
My wife never remarried after the divorce, and I never stopped loving her, Rose.
I see.
I have to give this a shot.
I really think I can make things work.
I hope you can, Ernie.
I know this is sudden, but it's something I really need to try.
Oh, I understand.
Really, I do.
I'll never forget what you've done for me.
It's all over.
We know.
We heard.
Now, honey, don't you be depressed.
What you did was wonderful.
And it's all because you're such a kind and sensitive and caring person.
You gave him back his manhood.
If he can find it, he can have it.
He's probably the worst lover I've ever had.
I'll get the ice cream.
I'll get the cheesecake.
I'll get the Etch A Sketch.
At my age, I need a visual aid.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" He should have been here a half-hour ago.
Dorothy, according to the rules of etiquette, you should never wait more than 20 minutes for a date.
She's already waited six months for a date.
What's another half-hour?
I hate blind dates.
You know, Ma, I never would have agreed to this if it wasn't your best friend Edna's good-looking doctor nephew.
Aw, he wasn't available anymore.
He decided to buy a woman from the Philippines.
Actually, he bought two women.
He wanted an extra for formal occasions.
Then who is this guy?
To tell you the truth, I was on the bus Wait a minute.
You set Dorothy up with some guy you met on a bus?
Please, it wasn't that glamorous.
I saw a sign on the bus.
It said, "Lonely?
Can't make connections with that special person"?
So I took $20 out of your purse, sent in a picture, they ran it through the computer and boom, you got a social life.
Ma, I cannot believe you sent my picture in to a total stranger.
I didn't send in your picture, I sent the picture that came with my wallet.
Ma, I am furious with you.
Think how mad your date's gonna be when he finds out he's not going out with Janet Gaynor.
Oh, God!
Dorothy, just remember how important first impressions are, honey.
Stand up straight.
Put your left hand on your hip.
Now, strike a very sexy, sultry pose.
Hello.
Hi, Dorothy.
What's wrong with your hip?
I was hoping you'd be my date, Rose.
Oh, gee, I'm busy tonight.
But maybe you could try me again next week.
What's in the box, Rose?
Brochures for the "Be a Pal" program.
I'm mailing them out.
How does that work?
Well, you just put 'em in an envelope and you stick a stamp on them.
Not that, you idiot.
Oh, the "Be a Pal" program?
Well, each week, you get a motherless girl and be her pal.
Help her with her homework and take her to movies and have dinner together.
That's very interesting.
Maybe I could get involved with that.
You, Blanche?
Sure.
Why, nothing would be more satisfying than to be of loving service to a lonely, motherless child.
Of course, I'll have to see pictures of the father before I commit.
If you're interested, I could call and see about sending over two girls.
Great.
Count me in.
Hi, I'm Eddie.
It took a computer to come up with this?
I'm Dorothy.
These are my friends, Blanche and Rose.
Hello, there.
How do you do?
Eddie, I hope you're not too terribly disappointed.
My mother wasn't exactly honest in sending in that picture.
I knew that.
I have quite a few Janet Gaynors in frames around my house.
Believe me, when you've been in a deep depression for a year and a half, nothing fazes you.
Well Eddie, what wonderful things have you got planned for tonight?
Nothing.
I was gonna cancel, but my therapist wouldn't let me.
Perhaps if we spoke to him together?
I'm sorry.
I'm still not really recovered.
You see, after 25 years of marriage, my wife Roberta sent me a Dear John letter.
That's terrible.
Married 25 years and she doesn't know your name is Eddie?
Well, I guess I have to feed you.
Let's go look for a place to eat, Roberta.
No, no.
Her name's Dorothy.
Your ex-wife is Roberta.
Sure.
Rub my nose in it.
Morning, Blanche.
You're up early.
I'm making a list of things to do with our little pals.
I just hope I'm good at it.
With all that enthusiasm, I'm sure you will be.
I just wanna make a difference in the lives of these youngsters.
I wanna teach 'em, I wanna mold 'em.
I wanna become a positive influence on every aspect of their young lives.
It is only one afternoon a week, isn't it?
Dorothy Zbornak, are you just getting in?
No, Blanche.
I got up early and went jogging in a park with a really strict dress code.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I need some coffee.
What's the number of the police station?
Is anything wrong?
No, I just wanna find out where I can buy the best donuts.
Of course something is wrong!
Dorothy never came home.
Yes, she did.
She's in the kitchen.
All right, spill it.
I want details.
Yes, so do I. Oh, me too.
Well, there is not much to tell.
Eddie took me to the restaurant where he had met his ex-wife Roberta.
I would think going there would just remind him of her.
It did.
Especially since she owns it, runs it and calls the place Roberta's.
As she was seating us, he begged her to come back to him.
And after he had wept over his crab cakes, I begged her to come back to him.
I guess you're not gonna see him again.
Oh, yes.
Yes, I will.
What?
Listen, pussycat, it's been a long time since you've been out on a date.
And it's quite possible you can no longer judge a good one from a bad one.
So let me be of help.
Bad date, Dorothy.
Bad, bad date.
What did you do the rest of the night?
I tried to comfort him.
I must have lost track of time 'cause next thing I knew it was morning.
Oh, I better get some rest.
We're meeting for lunch.
I don't get it.
They don't seem to have anything in common.
I guess it's just like that old saying: opposites attract.
That's very true.
Back in St. Olaf Ollie Canudenspringle and his wife Bridget were opposites in every way.
I mean, he was fat, she was thin.
He was neat, she was sloppy.
He was tall, she was short.
He was cheap, she was extravagant.
He was Opposites.
We get the picture.
Anyway, I'll never forget the time they sang at our annual talent show, right after the herring juggling act.
You mean to tell me that somebody actually juggled herring?
No.
It was the herring who did the juggling.
Tiny little Ginsu knives.
Really very dangerous.
I mean, one false move, they could have filleted themselves.
I hate you.
Anyway  Oh, good.
Here they are.
Come in, girls.
I'm Marla, this is Jackie.
We're from the "Be a Pal" program.
Yes, and I'm Blanche.
I just knew when I heard your voice on the phone that you'd be pretty.
Oh, well, thank you.
Rose, this is my little pal Jackie.
And your little pal Marla.
Hi, Marla.
Come on, sit down.
Now, is there anything special you girls feel like doing today?
Would it be too much to see a movie?
Oh, no.
We can go see Oliver & Company or Roger Rabbit.
Or Tequila Sunrise.
I hear Mel Gibson takes his shirt off a lot.
You know, Jackie, I think you and I are gonna get along just fine.
Well, just let me freshen my makeup.
Girls, why don't you come with me and I'll show you how I transform myself into a fresh-faced, innocent, young thing?
Could you skip the "innocent" part, Blanche?
The show starts in two hours.
Hi, Rose.
Blanche around?
She's showing the girls some makeup tricks before we go to the movies.
Anything I can do?
No, thanks.
I need to talk to somebody.
Oh, I get it.
You have a problem and you don't think I'm sophisticated or worldly enough to help.
Oh, Rose, I'm sorry.
You got a minute?
Sure, Dorothy.
It's about Eddie.
You know, I've been seeing him for a week now.
I'm having a relationship with him like I've never had with a man before in my life.
It is purely physical.
Eddie is the greatest lover I have ever had.
Come on, Dorothy.
If we're gonna do this, you have to tell me the truth.
No, I am telling you the truth.
Honey, there is more to Eddie than meets the eye.
But the only thing we have in common is under the sheets.
What's under the sheets?
His cappuccino maker.
Sex, Rose.
I am talking sex.
We don't go to dinner, we don't go to the movies, we just go to bed and it is terrific.
All that and cappuccino too?
Well, what's the problem?
Did I say there was a problem?
You wanted to talk about it.
Can't one have a discussion without there being a problem?
I thought maybe you were feeling guilty.
Guilty?
I have nothing to feel guilty about.
I am having the time of my life.
I just wanted to, you know, say it out loud.
But, listen, honey.
Don't mention this to anybody.
It's a thing that most people probably wouldn't understand.
Don't worry, Dorothy.
Rose Nylund can keep a secret.
Do you know what the name Nylund means in Norwegian?
No.
Well, I'm not telling you.
How do I look?
Great, Dorothy.
You going out with Eddie?
Yes.
Oh, by the way, Blanche, I borrowed your gold earrings, if that's OK?
Oh, it's fine, but I do think I should caution you - they were meant for petite ears.
They'll just have to do until Disney unveils their Dumbo line.
I'd better grab something to eat before Eddie gets here.
Wait a minute.
Why don't you just go out to eat?
There never seems to be enough time.
You know, there's something rotten in the state of Denmark.
It's their cheese.
They refuse to use preservatives.
I mean between Dorothy and Eddie.
There is something peculiar in that relationship.
You're right.
And I'm gonna find out what it is or my name isn't Sophia Sophia Sophia Petrillo.
Oh, yeah.
Maybe the doctor is right.
Maybe I do need all three pills a day.
Dorothy will never tell her.
Tell her what?
The secret that I don't know.
Rose.
There's something you know that you're not telling me.
You can ask me all the questions you want, you'll never break me.
So you're not in love with this Eddie guy?
Oh, no, Ma.
Then why are you spending all your time with him?
Eddie's a love machine?
I'm sorry, Dorothy.
I held out as long as I could.
She said she'd tickle me.
You're a regular Nelson Mandela, Rose.
So that's it?
Lust.
Look, Ma, I am a grown woman and I have needs.
Needs?
You need food.
You need air.
You need a better wrinkle cream.
You don't need sport nookie.
This is wrong for you.
Wrong for me?
This is why I didn't tell you about this in the first place.
You are always criticizing me, you are always judging me, you are always telling me what to do.
This time I'm going to do what feels right for me, and there's nothing you can say that'll make me feel guilty about it.
Boy, I wish I'd married Bing Crosby when I had the chance.
Why?
Because he was such a strict disciplinarian?
No, because now I'd be a wealthy widow with my own place in Pebble Beach, so I wouldn't have to listen to that crap.
I just haven't found a thing today.
I don't look right in American clothes.
I have a more European body.
Oh, in Europe, do they all have big butts too?
Hi, Blanche.
Hi, Rose.
Where on earth have you girls been?
We were helping elderly people get a good grip on the escalator.
We just lost all track of time.
How sweet.
Isn't that sweet?
Can you guys hold our bags?
We wanna go toss a few pennies in the fountain.
I'm gonna make a wish that we stay pals forever.
Oh, sweetie.
We'll see you in the car.
OK, bye.
Bye.
Aren't they the greatest?
Yes.
Looks like I've been a good influence on them.
Excuse me, ladies.
I need to inspect your bag.
I thought you were both asleep.
Why are you just getting in?
Because the justice system in America is an imperfect and sluggish piece of antiquated machinery.
What?
We were in the slammer.
Our cute little "pals" stole some merchandise and made us the fall guys.
We have to appear in court at noon tomorrow.
And where were you?
We were calling all night.
I was out with Eddie.
Actually, I just got home myself.
I wonder why Sophia didn't answer.
She probably thought it was me calling and decided not to answer.
It's a little guilt trick she's used on me ever since I was 15.
That and having major surgery and telling me about it two days later.
Sometimes she didn't even need the surgery.
That's guilt.
Well, the days of my mother making me feel guilty are over.
There is nothing wrong with my relationship with Eddie, and if my mother can't buy it, I'm very sorry, it is her problem.
Oh, just getting in?
Listen, if you three are just gonna use this place days, would you mind if I got one of those medical emergency beepers?
I'd feel terrible if one morning you found me on the doorstep instead of the Miami Herald.
Ma, it's not gonna work.
I do not feel guilty about staying out all night and I do not feel guilty about Eddie.
Don't underestimate me.
I could make you feel guilty about bombing Pearl Harbor if I wanted.
The point is, I don't want you to feel guilty.
There's nothing wrong with a physical relationship.
Well, then, what about what you said last night?
If you had let me finish my thought, Colonel Gaddafi, you might have understood.
I said I thought this kind of relationship was wrong for you.
Well, it's not.
Dorothy, I'm your mother.
I know you.
You're a loving and sensitive person.
But this isn't gonna be enough someday.
You'll be bored and dissatisfied and you'll end up unhappy.
I'd hate to see that happen to you, pussycat.
But if you think you can handle that, just look me straight in the eye and I'll drop the whole thing.
Ma I can handle that.
Both eyes.
Oh, Ma, I hate it when you're right, and I guess I knew you were right all along.
What are you gonna do, Dorothy?
Well, I'll have to have a talk with Eddie.
I mean, it is obvious that this relationship has to taper off.
All right, I'll end it.
Girls, I know you're gonna go to court and tell the truth.
We'd like to, but we could get in some trouble.
You see, most of the judges at juvenile court know us.
I think we've worn out our cute act.
Now, you listen to me, you little monsters.
If you think we'll be your patsies, you've have another thing coming.
Maybe some cookies and milk'd change your mind.
Here, how about $50 and you tell the truth.
What do you say?
Are you trying to bribe us?
Oh, yeah.
You catch on quick.
Make it 150 each.
Oh, you little pirates.
All right, you've got it.
Now, get out of here.
Thank you, Blanche.
Oh, beat it!
I can't believe you did that.
Don't worry.
That check was written on our vacation account that we closed last week.
The bank would sooner cash a check from Jim and Tammy Bakker.
Where are the girls?
Oh, they had a sudden change of heart.
They decided to confess.
Oh, God, that's Eddie.
I don't know if I can go through with this.
Don't worry.
We're both right beside you to help you through it.
It's not that easy.
Eddie has some kind of a strange hold over me.
Baloney.
Eddie is just a man, cut from the same cloth as the many men who have dumped you over the years.
Just think of him as all those men, Dorothy.
Become the dumper before you become the dumpee.
You're right.
I'm gonna get rid of him just the way Paul Bennington got rid of me.
The way Steve Mendlebaum got rid of me.
The way Tom We'll be here all afternoon.
Can you just open the door?
Blanche is right.
The man is history.
Hi, Dorothy.
Oh, Eddie, I want you so bad.
Dorothy.
I can't help it.
He looks so cute in that little suit.
Is something wrong, Dorothy?
Yes, there is something wrong.
Eddie, we have Eddie, stop doing that with your lip.
Doing what?
That sexy, quivering thing in the corner of your mouth.
I was just trying to loosen up a poppy seed caught in my teeth with my tongue.
Well, it's driving me crazy.
Dorothy!
Come here, Eddie.
Sit down here.
Listen, what Dorothy is trying to tell you What's that cologne you're wearing?
I'm not wearing cologne.
But that's impossible.
It smells kind of like a mixture of Old Spice and musk and And a porterhouse steak?
Yes.
That's me.
The smell really gets intense when I sweat.
Really?
Well, I'd be curious to find out just how Blanche!
Blanche!
Now, look here, Eddie.
Now, you listen to me.
Dorothy has decided she wants nothing more to do with you.
I can't understand why because I think you have about the cutest ears I've ever seen on a man in my entire life.
They make you kind of look like Bambi.
Marry me, Eddie.
Ladies, ladies, please!
This always happens.
I'm cursed.
Ever since I was a little kid, I've been absolutely irresistible to women.
I know I'm a little plain to look at No, you're not plain at all.
Oh, you're adorable.
Cute as a button.
Please.
Please, let me finish.
I know I'm plain to look at, but everything I do seems to drive the opposite sex crazy.
I don't do it on purpose.
It just happens.
The way I look at a woman.
The way I make love to a woman.
The way I kiss a woman.
The way I make love to a woman.
You said "make love" twice.
I know.
It's my favorite.
I'm not surprised you wanted to dump me tonight - the good ones always do.
They always end up wanting more than just nights filled with unbridled ecstasy.
What are you doing tomorrow night?
I'd better get going.
I've caused enough trouble.
Look, Eddie, can't we see each other occasionally, just as friends?
It won't work.
It's like trying to eat one potato chip.
Au revoir.
Oh, hello, Sophia.
Hello, Eddie.
Eddie, I never noticed that beauty mark on your neck.
What beauty mark?
That one!
Sophia!
Sophia!
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" What did you get?
I'm not sure.
I think it's coconut.
It's white on the inside but there's a red ring around the outside.
Oh, that's my lipstick.
I don't like coconut.
That's disgusting!
That piece of chocolate was in your mouth and I just put it in mine.
Big deal.
We took a bite out of the same piece of chocolate.
Call C. Everett Koop.
I only breast-fed you for two years of your life.
You wanna talk disgusting?
That's disgusting.
All right.
Enough already.
Don't take it out on me because your date dumped you on Valentine's Day.
Edgar did not dump me.
He and his lawyer were called out of town on urgent business.
Oh, please.
The man sells birdbaths for a living.
What happened - a sparrow slipped and is suing him?
I can't believe it.
Raymond called.
He's got the flu and he can't take me to the big Valentine's Day dance.
I guess I'll be keeping you company, Dorothy.
Why do you automatically assume that I don't have a date?
She assumes there are seven days in a week.
Have a chocolate, Ma.
The doctor didn't know what he was talking about when he said they were bad for you.
Well, have you ever seen anything more devastatingly beautiful in all your life?
Gosh, let's see.
Um That was a rhetorical question, Rose.
When are your dates picking you two up?
We don't have any dates, Blanche.
No dates?
On Valentine's Day?
Oh, you poor things.
Oh, I feel awful for you.
Well, the important thing is to keep your spirits up and don't get upset.
Oh.
Hello.
Oh, hello, Steve.
I'm all ready to go What are you talking about?
I spent all day getting ready.
Oh, I could just scratch your eyes out.
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you.
Drop dead.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Well, don't wait up.
I'll, uh Good night.
Blanche.
Steve called and canceled your date, didn't he?
Yes.
How did you know that, Dorothy?
I'm clairvoyant, Rose.
You're so lucky.
I get into a pool, I sink like a stone.
But how did you know about Blanche?
I cannot believe this.
Stuck here on Valentine's Day with the three of you.
Oh, this is the worst day of my life.
Quit complaining.
There are worse things that can happen to you on Valentine's Day.
I know.
Was there ever a Valentine's Day when you didn't have a date?
Please.
Until I was 80 I was combing geezers out of my blue rinse.
I'm talking about something that happened a long time ago.
My Sal and I were driving my father cross-country to a wedding when we had some car trouble.
Of course, Sal and Papa never got along anyway, so there was trouble even before we left Brooklyn.
But once we hit Chicago, the car started making a strange noise.
What are you looking at?
You don't have to pretend you know about cars.
You wanna impress me, learn to eat with a fork instead of a bread crust.
If you ask me, he ran out of gas.
Nobody asked you.
Was I talking to you?
I'm talking to my daughter.
To me, you don't exist.
Then who's driving you to your niece's wedding in California?
You're upsetting Papa.
Please find a mechanic.
It's freezing in here.
Of course it's freezing in here.
Mr. Ziti-for-Brains decides to take a shortcut through Chicago in the dead of winter.
Pop, he didn't plan it that way.
He lost the map.
He didn't know where he was going.
I could've told him where he was going.
I told you where he was going the first time I met him.
Nowhere.
That's where he was going.
You married a bum.
Excuse me.
We're having a problem with the car.
I'm sorry, I'm starting my lunch break.
When I get back, I got three jobs ahead of yous.
Beautiful.
Just what I always dreamed about - spending the winter in Chicago.
And, of course, the volcano season in Pompeii.
Look, uh, here's two bucks.
Would you lend me your tools while you're gone?
Help yourself, buddy.
Yeah.
When you want a beer you ask me which end of the opener to use.
What the hell are you gonna do with his tools?
Relax.
I'll have us out of here in no time.
The same words he used when he moved you into that crummy cold-water flat 12 years ago.
Papa, he's trying his best.
And that doesn't scare you?
You're not being fair.
You've never really given Salvadore a chance.
You know, I don't understand what you see in this man.
It's not something I can explain.
Everything you say about him is true.
Lord knows, he's not terribly bright.
He's not terribly good-looking and not much of a provider.
But I love him anyway.
I don't know why.
It's the little things.
You know what I mean?
I gotta take a leak.
Can you find the bathroom?
If not, I'll find a wall.
Sal, you having any luck under there?
To be perfectly honest, no.
No?
You botchagaloop.
Can't you do anything right?
I'm cold.
I'm tired.
I'm hungry.
You're hungry?
Here.
What's this?
Today's Thursday.
Valentine's Day.
Valentine's Day is Wait.
We left Brooklyn the 11th, so this Sal.
You planned this three days ago before we left Brooklyn.
Yeah.
I hid it under the seat when I was loading the suitcases.
Happy Valentine's Day, Sophia.
I think this is what I was trying to explain to Papa.
Come here, you big lug.
OK, I'm ready.
Let's go.
Papa, what was that noise?
My guess is machine guns.
What?
I'm in the back looking for the john, OK?
I see a bunch of guys lined up facing the wall, so I figure the toilet is broken, so I'm gonna wait in place behind one of these guys.
Suddenly, someone's yelling to me, "Get outta there.
You don't belong here".
I say, "Wait a minute.
I've peed against better walls than this in my time," when I see he's holding a machine gun.
So I decide to take his advice.
I move.
Rat-a-tat-tat, everybody's falling - like flies on your Aunt Regine.
You're letting your imagination run wild, Papa.
This is Chicago, not Sicily.
You're just a little homesick, that's all.
I saw another garage a couple of blocks away.
The car's not running.
Hey, who cares?
I am.
Ma, that never happened.
You were not at the St. Valentine's Day massacre.
I didn't say I was at the St. Valentine's Day massacre.
I said I was at a St. Valentine's Day massacre.
It was Chicago, and in those days Chicago stood for two things.
What were they?
How the hell should I know?
What am I, Studs Terkel?
I forgot.
Well, let's not just sit around wasting time eating chocolates.
Let's do something constructive.
You wanna eat some ice cream?
Mm, that's not a bad idea.
OK, Rose, go get it.
I'm too weak from disappointment.
I'm disappointed, too.
So what?
Dorothy, make her get it.
Get it, Rose.
Why are you two being so mean to me?
Because we're in bad moods.
And because we remember what you did to us last Valentine's Day.
You promised you'd never bring that up again.
What happened?
You don't remember what happened last Valentine's Day?
Please.
I'm 82.
Be thankful I remember not to wear my underwear outside of my dress.
Most of the time.
Tell your story.
Last St. Valentine's Day the three of us thought it might be fun to go away for the weekend.
So we went away to this cute little woodsy mountain retreat.
Well, when we got there were we in for a surprise.
Isn't this lodge great?
Oh, boy, it sure is.
It's just so beautiful up here.
The fresh air, the wide open spaces You know, being in the mountains always puts me in a romantic mood.
Dorothy, did you ever make love on top of a mountain?
No.
The closest I ever came was making love of top of a fat guy called Old Smoky.
Let's check in.
Hello, ladies.
Welcome to Sunny Meadows.
Oh, thank you.
We Whoa!
His klingenspritzer's showing.
Excuse me.
Where would you like me to put this?
Oh, well, buy me a drink and we'll talk.
Blanche.
I'm sorry.
Um, just hold onto it.
Uh, them.
I mean the bags.
Where do you put your tips?
Who cares?
What is going on here?
Obviously there's some confusion.
Sunny Meadows is a clothing-optional resort.
You mean a nudist camp?
Oh, well, we didn't know that.
Who made the reservation?
Well, don't look at me.
Rose, you made the reservation.
I know.
I just don't want you looking at me.
Look, I'm terribly sorry about the mix-up, but this is not for us.
We'd like to leave.
I'm afraid you're with us for the night, ladies.
The bus doesn't leave down the mountain till tomorrow morning.
Ladies, may I show you to your room?
Just point the way.
Oh, good, it's on the second floor.
Thanks a lot, Rose.
Oh, this is a great Valentine's weekend.
Stuck in a hotel at a nudist camp for ten hours.
I'm sorry, Dorothy.
It's all my fault.
I misunderstood the brochure.
"Fun in the buff at a mountain retreat.
"Hike, swim and play volleyball while the sun beats down on your fanny".
Call David Horowitz.
I mean, how can they get away with this misrepresentation?
I don't understand how people can run around showing their naked bodies to total strangers.
It's disgusting.
It's sickening.
It's terrible.
Yoo-hoo!
Blanche, would you please get away from that window for two seconds?
Come here.
I want you to see this guy playing volleyball.
Blanche, will you stop acting like a teenager?
You have seen naked men before.
What is the big deal?
Whoa.
Is that a legal serve?
Everybody seems to be having such a good time.
You know, the more you stare at everyone, the more natural it seems.
I have been thinking exactly the same thing.
Hey, why don't we just put our inhibitions aside and have some fun?
Yeah.
I mean, we don't know anybody here, and we'll never see any of these people again.
I'm really getting kinda hungry.
I wouldn't mind getting something to eat.
All right.
Then I say we just cast caution to the wind, get butt naked and have a good time.
If I had a dollar for every time you said that, I'd be a wealthy woman.
I'm starting to chicken out.
Now, Rose.
Don't you be self-conscious.
There's probably lots of people here with bodies worse than yours and Dorothy's.
Well, then let's just do it.
OK.
OK, we're almost there.
Here we go.
No, wait a minute.
Blanche, come on, this is ridiculous.
We can't go through an entire dinner holding these hearts in front of us.
Dorothy's right.
How will we cut our meat?
Well, look, either we do this or we don't do it.
Now, what's it gonna be?
We go at the count of three.
Ready?
One, two, three!
Excuse me, ladies, but we always dress for dinner here.
And in your case, we'd appreciate it if you'd do that for all three meals.
Oh, look, what are we sitting around here all depressed about?
Just 'cause it's Valentine's Day and our dates dumped us?
Yes, Blanche.
I wanted to hear it out loud before I had another bowl of ice cream.
I have an idea.
Let's go out to dinner and celebrate Valentine's Day ourselves.
Just 'cause we don't have dates doesn't mean we can't have a good time.
It doesn't?
Rose is right.
I mean, this is hardly a disaster.
We're not the only women who don't have dates on Valentine's Day.
Ma, you wanna join us?
I can't.
I have a date.
You do?
She's making that up to annoy us.
No, I'm not.
I have a date.
What's his name?
I can't tell you.
Have I met him?
No, he's from outta town.
Where is he taking you?
I'm not allowed to say.
Security reasons.
Ma, none of this is true.
OK.
I'll tell you.
It's Julio Iglesias.
You satisfied?
Make the reservation for four.
She'll tell us the truth when she gets hungry.
That is the truth.
He was visiting his aunt at the center.
He said he liked my spunk.
I guess it's not easy for anybody to accept being dateless on Valentine's Day.
What's so special about this day anyway?
Honey, it's the most romantic day of the year.
George proposed to me on Valentine's Day.
We know.
You told us.
So what?
You don't have anywhere to go.
I wasn't gonna tell you about that night, I was gonna tell you about another night many years later.
Same little romantic bar where George proposed.
My finest champagne and two glasses.
Very romantic.
Well, it is St. Valentine's Day, after all.
You can pour both of them.
I'm not expecting anybody.
It is St. Valentine's Day, lady, not St. Patrick's Day.
I'm not gonna drink them both.
I'm just celebrating.
My husband proposed to me in this very bar on St. Valentine's Day.
After that, we sort of made it a tradition and came back every year, so since he passed away I've just continued the tradition by myself.
Oh.
That's so romantic, proposing over champagne.
I never think of things like that.
I'm gonna ruin this whole night, I know it.
Wait, don't tell me you're thinking of popping the question right here on St. Valentine's Day, just like George did?
Yeah.
But now I'm thinking maybe it's a bad idea.
No, no.
Don't be nervous.
Don't you see?
This was meant to happen.
I'm here to help you.
I can tell you everything George said to me.
I don't know if that will work.
Sure it will.
Oh, come on, now.
We may be from different generations but some things never change.
Love is love, period.
Yeah, I suppose, but every couple is different.
You just listen.
We were sitting right here.
George took my hand in both of his and looked deep into my eyes and and he said, "You know, Blanche, you're a very special lady".
And then he said how he just couldn't bear the thought of spending even one day out of the rest of his life without me right there.
And then he said: "Blanche, would you be my wife"?
And after I stopped crying I said yes.
Blanche, you're right.
Love is love, period.
Some things never change.
I'm gonna go through with it.
Well, good for you.
Here.
And thank you for listening.
Oh, Victor, come on.
Let's get a table.
There's something I have to tell you.
Maybe I'm wrong.
Maybe some things do change.
Blanche, what a lovely, sweet story.
Tell me, did his girlfriend ever show up?
You're right, Blanche.
Some things never change.
My date'll be here soon.
I'd better get ready.
Oh, Ma, will you knock it off?
Ah, you're right.
At 82 what am I gonna get ready?
I always have my purse, and I shouldn't pee until he's got the motor running.
At any age you oughta be ready for your date, Sophia.
Blanche, she doesn't have a date.
No, I was thinking more about that time that the three of us were getting ready to go away on that Valentine's Day cruise with our steadies.
Oh, I remember that.
And we were picking up some odds and ends at the drugstore.
OK, we have the suntan lotion, Chap Stick, and half a dozen cheap, tawdry romance novels.
We're all set.
We have everything for the cruise.
Maybe we don't have everything we need.
Why?
What are we missing?
We are going away for a romantic weekend to the Bahamas with Jeff and Rich and Randy.
In this day and age it might be a good idea to take along some protection.
What kind of protection?
Two armed Pinkerton guards.
No, Blanche is talking about, uh A NestlÃ©'s Crunch?
One over.
An enema bag?
To the right.
Dentu-Grip?
Condoms, Rose.
Condoms, condoms, condoms!
Calm down, lady.
You just get outta prison?
Girls.
What do you think?
Well, it's not a bad idea, but I'm a little embarrassed.
Oh, me too.
Embarrassed?
There's no reason to be embarrassed.
These are discreet professionals.
This is a private matter.
Whatever we buy is nobody's business but our own.
I'd like a package of these, please.
And, uh, I'll take these.
And I'll take these.
Now, that wasn't so bad, was it?
Uh, Joe, I need a price check on some condoms.
These three ladies here want a couple of boxes of the King George prophylactics.
The lambskins or the ultrasensitive?
Two of 'em have the lambskins and the blonde has the ultrasensitive, in black.
The lambskins are $12.95 and the black's a dollar extra.
Look at all these people staring at us.
Oh, this is humiliating.
I've never been so embarrassed in my life.
All right, just what in hell are all of you staring at?
Haven't you ever seen three vibrant, healthy, sexually active women before?
We are embarking on a weekend cruise with some longtime gentlemen friends, and if we decide to be intimate, then we'll be prepared.
We're not embarrassed, we're not uncomfortable, we are not humiliated.
We're gonna walk outta here today with our heads held high, secure in the knowledge that what we have done is morally and socially responsible.
Isn't that right, girls?
I have no idea who this woman is.
I bought these for my brother.
Rose.
Rose!
I was never so embarrassed in my entire life.
But it did turn out to be a lovely Valentine's cruise.
Well, it did not.
We never even had to use those condoms.
You didn't?
I used every one of mine.
Late at night I filled 'em with water and threw 'em at the people in the limbo line.
I wonder who that could be?
Probably my date.
Don't make a fuss over him.
Your fiery Latin entertainers have a very short fuse.
Happy Valentine's Day.
Raymond, I thought you were sick.
And I thought you had to work.
You told me you had a last-minute emergency.
So they're all liars.
That's an asset when you're planning a surprise like this.
We've got reservations for dinner and dancing.
Ma, I bet you were in on this all along, weren't you?
Of course I was.
These dimwits' idea of romance is a Coors Light and a Love Boat rerun.
All right, let's go.
The limousine's waiting.
You little devils, you.
Wait a minute.
Honey, are you sure you don't wanna join us?
You got a marzipan bar in your ear?
I told you.
I've got a date with you-know-who.
Ma, we love you.
Yeah, right.
Oh You fell for it.
I did.
Julio?
Hello, Sophia.
Why didn't you use the front door?
I didn't want to be seen.
Well, what's the point in going out with Julio Iglesias if no one's gonna see us?
Tell me.
No.
Once we hit the deli, I'd appreciate it if you'd serenade me with "Begin the Beguine".
All right.
We sing together.
Oh, come on.
Let's try it together.
When they beguine The beguine That's it.
Perfect.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend"  Why are you both wearing black?
Did you just come from a funeral?
No, Rose.
We were singing backup for Johnny Cash.
Of course we were at a funeral.
Who died?
My best friend, Edith Flannery.
I thought Mildred Feinberg was your best friend.
She was, but we've grown apart.
I think her death had something to do with it.
I really thought Edith would be around longer.
She was only 88 and in perfect health.
Then one night, bingo, she closes her eyes and she's gone.
She died in her sleep.
Are you deaf?
I said she died playing bingo.
Well, I guess Phyllis Glockman will be my new best friend.
Ma, I thought you hated Phyllis Glockman.
I do, but the rate my friends are going, I won't have to spend much time with her.
I think Sophia's really been shaken up by this.
She's not the only one.
Dorothy, what do you mean?
Ma's 82 years old.
Edith was only six years older.
You can guess what I'm thinking.
You're thinking your time with Sophia may be running short.
Wow, Blanche.
That's amazing.
Now guess what I'm thinking.
I was talking to Edith's daughter after the funeral.
She'd flown in from San Francisco.
She kept telling me how bad she felt that she hadn't seen her mother in over a year.
It's hard to stay close to someone when they live clear across the country.
I live in the same house with my mother, yet we spend little quality time together.
You know, sometimes we'll be watching TV and I start wondering how many more times I have left like that.
And I find myself staring at her, like I'm trying to freeze her face in my memory.
Like I never want to forget one single line or wrinkle.
Suddenly she'll say, "Why are you staring at me?
I've been wanting to pick my nose for the past half hour".
Well, Dorothy, I live by one simple rule.
Share your love with people today 'cause they may be gone tomorrow.
That's a beautiful sentiment, Blanche.
Comes from dating a lot of traveling salesmen.
I heard a fable when I was a little girl in St. Olaf that might help.
Can I tell you?
That's right, Rose.
Wait till my defenses are down and take advantage of me.
Okey-dokey.
Once upon a time in the magical land of Flafluevenhaven lived Toonder the mediocre tiger.
He was mediocre because there was nothing special about him.
He wasn't talented, he wasn't smart, he wasn't rich, he wasn't handsome.
He wasn't good at anything.
If he also wore a bad toupee, she could be describing my Stanley.
Anyway, it made Toonder's wife miserable that her husband was best known for being mediocre.
I understand Marilyn Quayle feels the same way.
So she asked her fairy godmother to grant Toonder the ability to perform incredible feats of magic, and her wish was granted.
Toonder the Mediocre became Toonder the Magnificent.
I guess he didn't want to change the monograms on his towels.
Well, Toonder the tiger spent so much time performing that he didn't have enough time to spend with his wife.
She told him that she missed the time they had together when he was just mediocre, so Toonder used his magic only once more, and that was to make his powers disappear.
And they lived happily ever after?
No, actually she got bored and ran off with Wiseblat the weasel - Toonder's old business manager.
But they lived happily ever after.
What happened to Toonder?
Oh, who cares, Blanche?
Hey, once you hear "happily ever after," it's over.
Well, Dorothy, did you get anything out of this?
Actually I did get an idea.
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna take Ma away for the weekend to a cabin in the Florida Keys, where we can spend some quality time together.
You got that idea from her fable?
No, I got it from this brochure somebody left on the table.
But I'll tell you, I never would've read it if her fable hadn't bored me to tears.
Thank you, Rose.
You're welcome.
Ma, I have a surprise for you.
You've got a date Saturday night.
Better.
Ma, we're going away for the weekend, just the two of us.
So pack your bags, we're off to a cabin in the Keys.
Wait a minute, Dorothy, you pulled this one on me once before.
Remember Shady Pines Retirement Village?
She told me we were going to a resort.
We pull up to this place that looks like the Bates Motel and two goons in white coats drag me inside.
For the next year and a half, I'm forced to make lanyards against my will.
Ma, you know that's not how it was.
You're right.
Sometimes they forced me to make moccasins.
No thanks.
Not again.
Ma, all I want us to do is go away together, just the two of us.
Ma, we'll go anywhere you want to go.
Great.
I want to go to Disney World.
Then that's where we're going.
Oh?
All of a sudden you're gonna take me after I've been asking for years?
That's right.
Leave your shoe sizes and whether you want your moccasins in brown or black.
Oh, hello.
This is Dorothy Zbornak.
I'd like to confirm my reservation on flight 505 to Orlando.
Uh-huh.
Uh, now, let's go over the arrangements I made to have my mother taken away at the departure gate.
You don't know what I'm talking about?
Neither do I. Goodbye.
Hi, Ma.
Are you ready to go?
You bet, pussycat.
I'm glad you stopped being so suspicious.
Oh, please, if you can't trust family, who can you trust?
There's our cab.
Oh, girls, don't forget to pick me up one of those hats with ears.
We won't forget, Rose.
It's not for me, it's for one of the girls in my Sunshine Cadet troop.
Yeah, we know, Rose.
I'm too old for that silly stuff but the girls love it.
Right, Rose.
You want R-O-S-E sewn on the back?
If it's not too much trouble.
Space Mountain, here I come.
Ma, I told you, no scary rides.
Then we'd better find another way to get to the airport.
The cabby is wearing a turban.
They are going to have such a great time.
What are you doing?
Oh, just doodling.
What do you think?
Let's see.
Oh, it's a tiger.
With multicolored stripes, wearing a tuxedo, a top hat, and holding a magic wand.
Oh, my gosh, it's Toonder the magnificent tiger.
Yes.
Oh!
I've been thinking about him ever since you told us that fable.
You know when you just can't get something out of your head?
Oh, yeah, water's the worst.
That's why I always wear earplugs when I shampoo.
I was talking about your fable.
Listen, Rose, I've come up with an idea.
With your stories and my illustrations, we just might have a bestseller here.
What do you say to us teaming up and writing a kids' storybook together?
Oh, Blanche, that's a terrific idea.
When my children were small, I bought those illustrated storybooks all the time.
And I bet your kids loved them.
No, they had their own books.
Ma, you've been in there for 20 minutes, now, what are you doing?
Painting a fresco on the ceiling.
It's a bathroom.
What do you think I'm doing?
What are you writing?
Oh, nothing.
What do you mean nothing?
What is that?
Well, Ma, you have such a great sense of humor.
I can never remember all the funny things you say, so I've decided to keep a journal.
Journal?
Who the hell are you?
Bill Moyers?
That is classic.
"Bill Moyers".
Fine.
I'll give you great stuff while we're on Space Mountain.
Not so fast.
Ma, I have a surprise for you.
What is it?
Remember all those photos we kept in Pop's old cigar boxes?
I've organized them into these albums.
Ma, they're for you.
They're for us.
They're for later.
Let's go.
Come on.
Ma, the park can wait.
Let's do this now.
OK, but let's make it quick.
Oh, Ma, look.
Here's you holding me when I was a baby.
Do you remember what was going through your mind then?
Oh, yeah.
I'll never forget that summer day in 1932.
I was thinking, "Boy, am I blessed to have such a precious baby in my life".
Oh, Ma, that's beautiful.
Things are going just great.
Look at this.
You're holding my hand while I'm skating.
What were you thinking then?
I'll never forget that winter day in 1934.
I was thinking, "Boy, am I blessed to have such a precious two-year-old in my life".
Oh, look.
Here's one of us on a bicycle built for two.
I'll never forget that spring day in 1940.
I was Ma, you're making this up.
Of course I am.
How the hell should I remember what I was thinking back then?
I still look for Ed Sullivan on Sunday nights.
The scary part is sometimes I find him.
Ma, why can't you make me happy?
I want to do this.
OK, OK, if a trip down memory lane is gonna make you happy, pussycat, I'm willing to take a short stroll.
Listen, I'll tell you what we'll do.
We'll order dinner in, we'll finish looking at the photos, and then we can reread these old letters.
Gee, it's too bad you didn't bring along the slides.
Ma, now you've got the spirit.
I finished a sketch of Toonder's little pals, the Dingleheimer twins.
Wow.
This book is really coming along.
Yeah, and you can chalk it all up to synergism.
Yeah, synergism.
What would we ever do without it?
Good old synergism.
You have no idea what it means, do you?
Not a clue.
Synergism is the powerful energy that is generated by two people engaged in the same activity.
Up till now, I had no idea it could occur outside a Howard Johnson's motor lodge.
You still have no idea what I'm talking about, do you?
Nope.
Oh, but I can't tell you, Blanche, how much I enjoy working with you.
Me too.
You know why?
'Cause we're not just partners, we're friends.
We're good friends.
I feel I could say anything to you.
Of course you can, sugarplum.
Even criticize your artwork.
Of course.
The whole point of collaborating is to get beyond our egos and come up with something we both like.
What do you think?
This could use a few minor changes.
Drop dead.
Whatever happened to getting beyond your ego?
My ego has nothing to do with it.
These drawings are brilliant.
I have lived with these characters all my life.
I'll determine if your drawings are brilliant, and that one needs work.
What's wrong with it?
You forgot Melvin the loneliest sea otter's little beanie with the propeller on top.
No, I didn't.
It blew away.
It did not.
It did too.
Big wind came along, blew it right off his head.
That couldn't have happened.
I say it did and you're gonna write it in the story.
And what if I refuse?
You see this eraser?
I'm going to rub out Melvin's little friend, Mookie the sailor.
You wouldn't.
Try me.
No, please, Blanche.
I'll do anything you say.
I thought you'd see it my way.
Oh, Pop was sure a lousy photographer.
Who is that?
Uncle Vittorio.
His head's cut off.
How can you tell?
Because that's exactly how he looked in the morgue after he turned state's evidence against Benny the Blade.
Oh, Ma, this is so special, spending this time together.
Yeah, right.
You know, Dorothy, I think we're missing a box of slides.
They must be in the suitcase in the closet.
Oh, I'll take a look.
Ma, where are you going?
I can't stand it anymore.
Your life is supposed to flash before your eyes when you're dying, not on when you're on vacation.
I've waited my whole life to ride Space Mountain and nothing is gonna stop me.
Why are you always taking her side?
Who'd have thought it would rain for 24 hours straight?
Red sixes.
Does this look like a game of solitaire?
It's your turn.
I'm sorry, Ma.
I was trying to remember when was the last time I said I love you.
After lunch, when I said you had grilled cheese stuck to your chin.
Now will you make your move, for God's sake?
You're really making this difficult for me.
You know I'm not great when it comes to dealing with emotions.
Whenever someone starts talking about their deepest feelings, I usually get uncomfortable and tune out.
I don't know why.
Where do you think it comes from, Ma?
Huh?
Oh, sorry, Dorothy.
My corn pad slipped.
You were saying?
Never mind.
You think the rain is ever gonna let up?
You know something?
I honestly don't care.
Who needs outside distractions?
What we have here is more important.
What we have is getting on my nerves.
Ma, where are you going?
Someplace where there are no pictures, no slides, and no walks down memory lane.
I'll come with you.
What?
Are we nuns?
We don't have to travel in pairs.
I'm outta here.
Hey, Sam.
What's that you're playing?
Oh, just a little something.
Stop it.
You know what I want to hear.
No, I don't.
You played it for her.
You can play it for me.
But I don't think that I If she can stand it, so can I. Now play.
OK.
You're the boss.
It's a world of laughter It's a world of tears It's a world of hopes And a world of fears There's so much that we share That it's time we're aware It's a small world after all Ma.
Of all the saloons and gin joints in the world, she had to walk into mine.
Ma, I've been looking everywhere for you.
We really need to talk.
Ma, why are you trying so hard to ruin my weekend?
You don't get it, do you?
This weekend could've been a lot of fun, until you decided we were gonna have quality time.
Is that so horrible?
Ma, all I wanted to do was have us finish unfinished business and say things to each other that we never said before.
Dorothy, this isn't On Golden Pond.
I know, Ma.
And you're not Jane Fonda.
All right.
You made your point.
Quality time has to come naturally it happens when you're not thinking about it.
Like when we're cutting vegetables.
That's quality time.
I was hoping for something a little more magical than that.
Let me tell you a little story.
When I was a kid in Sicily, I loved lightning bugs.
I'd stand out in the field and watch them light up the night sky.
That was magical.
That was spectacular.
I tell you, I saw a thousand points of light.
It was a kinder, gentler America.
I turned to my wife, Barbara, and I said Ma, what the hell are you talking about?
Oh.
Sorry, I must have lapsed into George Bush's inauguration speech.
Where was I?
Lightning bugs.
Right.
I liked them so much, I'd catch them in glass jars so I could watch them light up whenever I wanted, but they always died.
I see what you mean.
They needed their freedom.
No, they needed their air.
I always forgot to punch holes in the lid.
The point is it's the same with all magical moments.
You can't capture them forever, no matter what Kodak tells you.
So what you're saying, Ma, is that, like a lightning bug, I put you in a glass jar and, waiting for you to light up, I nearly suffocated you.
Jeez, Dorothy, you sure know how to beat a metaphor to death.
Ma, I love you.
I love you too, pussycat.
Promise you'll never make me do this for the rest of my life.
OK.
Only if you promise you'll live forever.
OK, I promise.
How can you make a promise like that?
Hey, if I don't come through, what are you gonna do to me?
Blanche.
Rose, listen.
I think maybe I owe you an apology.
When we were having our argument, I may have said things I didn't mean.
Like when you said I was a dummy?
No.
Anyway, the important thing is to stay partners and finish our book.
Forget it.
There isn't gonna be any book.
Now what are you saying?
Did I just lapse into Swedish?
Read it and weep.
"Tales of Toonder the Tiger and His Friends, by Hans Christian Lockerhueven".
Well, who's Hans Christian Lockerhueven?
Only St. Olaf's greatest author.
He wrote the classic fairy tale, "Hansel and Hansel".
You told me your parents made up these stories.
I thought they did, but when I called my sister for more stories, she suggested I pick up the book that Mom and Dad got them from.
This is great.
We've been writing stories that have already been written.
Well, if it's any consolation, they do it all the time on Mr. Belvedere.
Well, my dream is crushed.
I always wanted to be rich and famous and now it's not gonna happen.
I know a poem that might help.
It goes: "Never, ever give up your dreams, "even when they're doused in sorrow, "because even though they seem far away, they could come true tomorrow".
I wrote that, Blanche.
You know, it isn't half bad.
It's better than a lot of them you read on greeting cards.
I have hundreds of them.
You know what I'm thinking, Rose?
That with your drawings and my poems, we might go into the greeting card business together?
No.
I'm thinking about a place out at the beach where the waves break so hard, they knock the bathing suits right off the men coming out of the water.
Come on.
Maybe we can salvage the rest of this day after all.
Come on, let's go.
Hi, Ma, how's the packing going?
It'd go a lot better if I had a screwdriver.
I just bought some postcards to remember the trip.
I don't need postcards, pussycat.
I'll remember this trip for a long time.
Oh, just our luck.
The rain lets up when we're leaving.
Hey, Ma, we still have a little time and there's one more thing I want to show you to make this terrific weekend complete.
Oh, no, Dorothy.
We looked at pictures and slides and letters and diaries and locks of hair.
What's left?
Our family history in shadow puppets?
Ma, better.
Now, this is what I call quality time.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend"   Puff the magic dragon Lived by the sea And frolicked in the autumn mist In a land called Honah Lee Puff the Thank you!
That was very odd.
If I increase my steroids by 100 milligrams, I can sing just like Barbara Mandrell.
Would that get me on the show?
No.
But if you're ever in prison, I bet it'd get you everyone's dessert.
Oh, this is terrible.
The Ladies Auxiliary puts me in charge of the variety show, and we can't come up with one decent act.
It's too bad we're not back in St. Olaf.
Why?
They have a lot of talent back in St. Olaf?
No.
It's lunchtime there.
I could really go for a smoked kipper hero.
All right, who's auditioning next?
I'm next.
Ma!
What the hell are you doing here?
I gnawed through my leather restraints and outran the new guard dog.
I'm here for the audition.
Forget it.
You force your way into the show every year, and every year, it's a total disaster.
You can't sing, you can't dance, you can't tell jokes.
I'm sorry, you can't be in the show.
"You can't be in the show.
You can't be in the show".
Who are ya - Ricky Ricardo?
For your information, I'm not here to audition.
Why are you here?
I realized I had no talent, so I decided to become an agent.
Why Ryan O'Neal hasn't come to the same conclusion, I'll never understand.
Anyway, I'm proud to announce I'm the exclusive worldwide representative of the Donatello Triplets!
Hit it, my magnificent little songbirds.
I don't wanna take it anymore I'll just stay here locked behind the door Just no time to stop and get away 'Cause I work so hard to make it every day Ooh-ooh Ooh-ooh And it's hard to say Just how some things never change And it's hard to find Any strength to draw the line Oh, I'm just burning, doing the neutron dance Oh, I'm just burning, doing the neutron dance What do you think?
They're adorable!
Love 'em!
They're perfect for the show.
Take five.
Go wait in the van.
It's not professional to have them here while I'm negotiating.
Negotiating?
Sophia, this show is for charity.
The word "charity" is not in a good agent's vocabulary.
Ma, thank you very much for your time, but there are plenty of other talented people here willing to do the show for free.
Who's next?
The Sklarkievich Brothers.
Hello.
I am Misha Sklarkievich.
My brother Andrzej is still in Poland.
Why don't you show us what you can do?
Is better with my brother.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Is better with my brother.
If you change your minds, you know where to find me.
Dorothy, I have terrible news.
We don't have an MC for the talent show.
Kent Ferguson, the KTMB weatherman, has just dropped out.
You have to be kidding.
What happened?
He's filling in for Willard Scott on the Today show.
It seems Willard ate some bad scallops on the air that he got through the mail.
He wandered over to the critics' corner and lost his cookies on Gene Shalit.
Gene thought it was because Willard disagreed with his review of The Accidental Tourist.
Willard apologized and left the studio.
Officially, they're saying he's "on assignment".
Well, at least some good came of it.
It's about time someone threw up on Gene Shalit.
Oh, volunteering to organize this variety show is the worst idea we have ever had.
We've hardly sold any tickets, we can't find an MC and every act that we have auditioned is awful.
Dorothy, I've got some good news.
I've had a change of heart.
I'll let the triplets be in your show for free.
Why, Sophia, that's w You don't know how much good this does us.
Wait just a minute.
What's the catch?
That is so typical of you.
Why do you automatically assume because I'm trying to do something nice there's a catch?
So there isn't a catch.
I didn't say that.
It just ticks me off that you automatically assume there's one.
Ma, what is it you want?
For the moment, only for you to feast your eyes on the Great Alfonso!
The Great Alfonso!
Seymour.
Hello, I'm the Great I'm the Great Alfonso.
What?
Pull the damn rabbit out of your hat!
Oh, right.
Right.
Abracadabra, hocus-picus Pocus.
My God, where's the damn rabbit?
I left it in the other hat.
Sophia, he's terrible.
No, he's not.
He's terrific.
Oh, you mean the act?
We'll work on that.
So that's it.
You're willing to give us the Donatello Triplets if we put your new boyfriend in the show.
That's blackmail.
That's show business.
Hi, girls.
How's everything going?
Awful.
Kent Ferguson canceled.
We don't have an MC for the talent show.
We don't even have any talent for the talent show.
The whole thing's gonna be a disaster.
I'll be the laughingstock of the Ladies Auxiliary.
Oh, honey Would it help if I got Bob Hope to be our MC?
How are you going to get Bob Hope?
Easy.
He's my father.
Rose, have you been forgetting to wash the fruit before you eat it?
I'm serious.
Bob Hope is my father.
Well, sort of.
I mean, he could be, maybe.
Rose, what the hell are you talking about?
There's something I've never told you girls.
I spent the first eight years of my life at the St. Olaf orphanage.
Gunther and Alma Nylund are my adoptive parents.
How come you never told us about this before?
I loved my parents so much, I really never think about it.
But I sure did before I became their daughter.
When I was at the orphanage, I used to daydream all the time that my real parents would knock on the door and take me away.
So, like most of the kids there, I started fantasizing about who they might be.
I had a particularly clear picture in my head of my father.
Anyway, one day, they took us all to the movies, and when Bob Hope came on the screen, I stood up and yelled, "My God, that's my father!
That's him"!
Rose, honey, you don't still actually believe that?
Believing that got me through some very rough times, Blanche.
I mean, whenever I had a problem I couldn't solve, I'd just write Bob Hope a letter or go to one of his movies, and suddenly I was able to work it all out.
All my life, I always felt he was there if I needed him.
That's why I know he won't let me down now.
I don't know whether to cry or commit you.
You just leave it to me.
I know in my heart he'll be here.
Rose, just so I get this straight, you never actually met Bob Hope?
No.
But I'm sure looking forward to it.
And now I'd like to thank all those bake-sale participants who raised money for the religious cult deprogramming center.
I'm happy to report that Doris Levy's son Marshall is now back in law school.
Now it's time for an update on our biggest and most important charity fund-raiser of the year - the annual hospital variety show benefit.
I'd like to call on our chairman Dorothy Zbornak for an update.
Dorothy?
Well, I'm  I'm very happy to report that, uh, this year's variety show is really coming along.
The first thing I'd like to discuss - Yes, Frieda?
I heard that ticket sales are not going very well, I heard you have not been able to find any good talent and I heard that Kent Ferguson has canceled and we don't have an MC for the show.
I heard you've been sleeping with the Japanese guy who blows the leaves out of your driveway!
It so happens Dorothy is doing a terrific job.
Matter of fact, she's in the middle of negotiations with some very big-name celebrities to be our MC.
Like who?
Well, like Great news!
We've got Bob Hope for our MC!
Nice work, Dorothy.
Meeting adjourned.
Goodbye, ladies.
See you soon.
Take care.
Bye-bye.
Rose, how did you get Bob Hope?
Well, I called his office.
I have to talk to you.
Not now, Ma.
What did he say?
I didn't talk directly to Bob Hope.
Alfonso has a new trick.
Give him your keys.
Who did you talk to, his agent?
No.
This is one of those mental tricks you're gonna love.
Who did you talk to?
A very nice receptionist at NBC.
I am focusing all me powers on this metal object.
That's idiotic!
No, be patient.
It's a very good trick.
You're basing this whole thing on a conversation you had with a telephone operator at NBC?
We're going to have to go and tell everyone it was all a big mistake.
VoilÃ !
Oh, will you I thought you'd be Just go.
Go.
All my keys are bent.
Don't just stand there.
Applaud the man.
How'd it go, Dorothy?
Awful.
When I told everyone at the club that Bob Hope wasn't going to be in the show, they actually booed me.
Ohh.
I've never been so humiliated in my entire life.
Aw, come on.
You've been humiliated plenty.
Remember when you tried out for cheerleading in high school?
Ma, why do you constantly look for ways to amuse yourself at my expense?
Because we don't have cable, and I can't crochet.
This is who I am, Dorothy.
Learn to live with it or medicate me.
I still can't believe that Rose caused all this trouble.
Unbelievable.
This whole fantasy about Bob Hope is sick.
Sick.
If she's gonna have fantasies, they ought to be the normal, healthy kind - like sweaty Argentinean cowboys whipping things while they ride naked on the back of Brahma bulls.
I have to remember to stop using your towels.
This Rose/Bob Hope thing reminds me of a similar situation back in my village.
Florence Pontevecchio used to fantasize that Alberto Bolognese was her brother.
Who was Alberto Bolognese?
He was the boot maker in the village.
What's so special about that?
Did I say it was special?
I said it was similar.
I'm having a cup of tea, talking.
The two of you have a look on your face like you paid for Phantom of the Opera tickets.
Excuse me for not being Somerset Maugham.
Better I should say nothing from now on and sit here like a pincushion!
Hi, girls.
Did Bob Hope call?
Rose, will you stop being an idiot?
Bob Hope is not gonna call, and he is not gonna MC our show.
Why, what do you mean?
I said he'd be here, and he will.
Rose, Rose, this is not Miracle on 34th Street.
You are a grown woman holding on to childhood fantasies.
Bob Hope is not your father.
He has no idea who you are, and he's not about to come anywhere near this place.
That's not true.
He's here in Miami.
It's right in today's paper.
She's right - he is in a golf tournament here.
Apology accepted.
Rose, what the hell are you talking about?
That doesn't mean he's gonna be in our show.
Don't you see, Dorothy?
He's here in Miami because he knows I need him.
This is all working out.
I can feel it.
Dorothy, I think I might have a way to get Mr. Hope to be in our show after all.
Why don't we go to the golf tournament, find Mr. Hope and explain our situation?
He's always doing charity events.
I guess it's worth a shot.
Yeah.
You don't have to go through all that trouble.
He'll be at the show.
What you need is faith.
And what you need is a psychiatrist who enjoys a challenge.
Excuse me, you guys got any extra shaving cream?
Sure.
Oh, this is so weird.
I've never been in a men's locker room before.
Neither have I. I really like the new carpet they Me neither.
This is ridiculous.
This is never gonna work.
Listen, the caddy said Mr. Hope just finished his round of golf.
He's gotta be in here somewhere.
What if he is?
He's not about to do a favor for three people who look like Sam Snead with a hormone problem.
Look, you two stay here.
I'm gonna check out the rest of the locker room.
I'll start with the Jacuzzi.
You don't know where the Jacuzzi is.
Yeah, it's just down the hall, second door I'll ask somebody.
This has been a nightmare.
Oh, don't worry, Dorothy.
It's all gonna work out.
Because Bob Hope Bob Hope won't let us down.
Right.
Rose, Rose, I have known you for over five years.
In that time, I have heard the most bizarre stories I have ever heard in my entire life.
There was Clovis the two-headed mule who skied backwards on buttermilk.
It was cottage cheese.
The point is, Rose, this Bob Hope story is odd, even for you.
Bob Hope's gone.
We just missed him.
Oh, what?
I saw him getting into a limousine and driving away.
They said he's going to the airport.
That can't be.
The show is tomorrow tonight.
He wouldn't leave before that.
He knows I'm depending on him.
There must be some other explanation.
Maybe Maybe I'm just a foolish old woman who's lived a silly fantasy her whole life.
Oh Honey.
Now now, honey.
Oh, honey.
All right, that's it.
We gotta get that antique dealer off the membership committee.
And what he knows you ain't got time to learn These boots are made for walkin' And that's just what they'll do One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you  The Donatello Triplets, ladies and gentlemen.
I'll bet those boots have more miles on them than - Uh "Joan Collins' waterbed".
Her waterbed.
And now I have a real treat for you - straight from Poland, the Sklarkievich Brothers!
Where's your brother?
Oh, do the best you can.
Hey!
Hey!
So?
Do we go on next?
Ma, I can't let him.
Hey, I let you have the Donatello Triplets.
A deal is a deal.
Sophia, Alfonso will only embarrass himself.
Please.
If he was worried about being embarrassed, he wouldn't walk around with that much hair in his ears.
Besides, he called his old vaudeville partner, and they've perfected one of their old tricks.
I know, I know.
It's better with your brother.
Well, it can't get any worse.
Alfonso, you're on.
Well, it looks like I'm in the show after all.
Girls, something terrible has happened.
Gee, and everything was going so well up until now.
Look at these programs.
Bob Hope's name is still on 'em.
Who's in charge of the programs?
I forgot.
I guess I figured he was gonna come.
We have to make an announcement and refund everybody's money.
And I guess now is as good a time as any.
Well, this is all my fault.
Let me do it.
Oh And now my beautiful assistant will step into the magic box.
Alfonso, I need to make an announcement.
Yes, well, take your time.
I forgot the magic words.
Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Rose Nylund, and I'm responsible for what's happened here tonight.
Uh Because of a silly childish dream, I let you all down.
I had this crazy idea that I had a special connection to a very special person, and that's why on all your programs it says that the guest celebrity for tonight's show is Presto!
Bob Hope!
Hey, I know this show is for charity, but that's the smallest dressing room I've ever had in my life.
Oh, my God, you're really Mr. Bob Hope.
Being this close to you is the biggest thrill of my life.
If you were any closer, there wouldn't be room for my car keys.
Mr. Hope, could we impose upon you to entertain for a few minutes?
Will I entertain?
I didn't put this makeup on to go bowling.
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Bob Hope!
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Did you hear Did you hear that Ronald Reagan has just moved back to Hollywood?
Just what Hollywood needs - another unemployed actor.
Do you know Reagan left office with the highest popularity rating since FDR.
He was more popular than Tammy Bakker at a Maybelline convention.
I can't believe it.
How on earth did he get here?
You know how Alfonso kept talking about his old vaudeville partner?
It turns out it was Bob Hope.
Isn't that a kick?
Since Ron and Nancy moved back to California, we've had earthquakes almost every day.
Do you think God could be a Democrat?
But earthquakes don't bother the president.
If Sam Donaldson couldn't shake him up, nothin' will.
Oh, Rose, I think we owe you an apology, honey.
You were right after all.
You don't owe me any apology.
This was a lucky coincidence.
I'm just glad it all worked out.
Boy, but I have learned one lesson - no more silly daydreams for me.
Now, Nancy Reagan has mixed feelings about moving back to California.
She's afraid her husband might not have as much free time to spend with her anymore.
Thanks, Dad.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Hi, Blanche.
Girls, you are my very best friends in the entire world, and I trust and respect you more than any people I know.
So I want you to tell me the truth.
Now, honestly, do you think I'm competent at what I do?
Based on the sounds from your bedroom, I'd bet you're damn near spectacular.
I am talking about my job at the museum.
Of course you're competent.
They wouldn't have kept you for five years if you weren't.
Then why is my boss constantly looking over my shoulder?
I would guess a plunging neckline and a push-up bra.
I swear, sometimes I think I just wanna throw in the towel and take an early retirement.
I wonder if you can collect Social Security at 49, 50.
Blanche - the address of the Social Security building?
Come on now.
You had a bad day at work.
Happens to all of us, but we're not retiring.
I just don't know what I'd do if I retired.
No problems to solve, no challenges.
I'd be afraid my mind would go soft.
Don't even talk that way, Rose.
That's crazy talk.
It sure would be nice to have some investments to fall back on, though.
I just never had a mind for that.
Me neither.
I never had a mind for money matters.
I always used to let Stanley handle all our investments.
Did he have a head for numbers?
Stanley?
The man used to have to get naked to count to 21.
Little more.
Another one.
Now, if you ask me, we are doing fine, starting out slow, you know, going in on that certificate of deposit together.
It's the simplest form of investment.
An idiot couldn't screw it up.
By the way, Rose, what was the rate today for the CD at the bank?
I didn't go to the bank today.
I was called to work early, so I asked Sophia to go for us.
You let Ma leave the house with $3,000 of our money?
What's wrong with that?
What's wrong?
!
Odds are she'll probably come back with a handful of magic beans!
Dorothy, just relax.
Your mother is a responsible woman.
She knows how long it took us to save that money.
You can trust her.
Don't get mad.
Ma, did you buy the CD today?
Not exactly.
I said, don't get mad.
Sophia, what did you do with our money?
I think you're gonna be really impressed.
I made a very shrewd deal with a guy I met at the bus stop.
Oh!
Now, I know it's a big responsibility to take care of one, but I bought a boxer.
You spent $3,000 for a dog?
He's no dog.
He's a winner.
Come on in, Pepe.
Ma, you bought a prizefighter?
It's a once-in-a-lifetime investment.
A week from now, you're gonna be kissing the ground I walk on.
You're gonna be looking up at it from the other side.
What happens a week from tonight?
Pepe, tell them.
Â¿QuÃ©?
Pepe, boom-boom.
Kill Gonzales!
Attaboy, tiger.
Hey, Pepe, why don't you do some roadwork while we talk?
Â¿QuÃ©?
Immigration, Pepe.
Immigration.
Nobody has to worry about anything.
This is the chance of a lifetime.
Even if Pepe loses next week's fight, he still gets $10,000.
How is that possible?
It's a guaranteed purse.
And for our lousy 3-grand investment, that's a $7,000 profit.
Pepe gets the standard 20%, and we're left with a tidy sum for only one week's work.
So 20% is standard for a boxer?
It is if he doesn't speak English.
Ma, that's it.
Forget it.
Take him back.
To where, Customer Service?
Besides, I believe there's a no-return clause on fighters.
Unless you're Robin Givens.
Ma, this isn't making any sense.
It's all legit.
I checked it out.
If you don't mind, we're gonna make a few phone calls in the morning to try to find out what this is all about.
The whole thing is ridiculous.
Fine.
In the meantime, I'll bunk with you.
I told Pepe he could have my room.
He's staying here with us?
Hey, we're in training.
And set another place at the table.
Hey, Pepe.
Pepe, you like ravioli?
Â¿QuÃ©?
Boom-boom.
Kill Gonzales!
Yeah, his name is Kid Pepe.
That's right.
He's supposed to have a fight next week.
Yeah, thank you.
I'll hold.
OK, Kid, there are three things you have to remember in the ring.
One - keep your face covered, two - keep your head down and three - keep moving at all times.
Incidentally, the same rules apply if you're ever dining at a clam bar in Little Italy.
Ma, will you turn that down?
I can't hear.
Uh, yes, yes.
Yes, I'm still here, yes.
Oh.
So the contract is valid?
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much.
Everything is on the up and up.
He does have a fight scheduled.
All we have to do is hire a cut man, but I can probably do that on my way back from the dry cleaner's.
Gee, it sounds so natural, doesn't it?
Then I guess till next Tuesday, we are Kid Pepe's managers.
What happens after Tuesday?
We take our winnings and buy a heavyweight.
OK.
A middleweight and a microwave.
Ma, forget it.
This insanity lasts exactly one week, and that's only because we have a chance of possibly getting our savings back.
The minute the fight is over, it is "Adios, Pepe".
No!
No, no, Pepe!
Get back here and boom-boom.
Wouldn't it be something, though, to make $7,000 in 7 days?
It sure would.
Oh, girls, remember what we're dealing with.
My mother bought this man at a bus stop.
Jab.
Left.
Jab, jab, left.
Ma, you don't know the first thing about boxing.
Please.
I used to be known as the Don King of Sicily.
Of course, I used to wear my hair differently then.
I might be able to help Pepe, too.
You can be a constant reminder of what might happen if you spar without headgear.
I mean I might be able to help him with this.
A, my name is Anne, and my husband's name is Alf.
We come from Anhoev, and we sell antlers.
This is ridiculous.
The important thing is that we get our money back.
What difference does it make if Pepe wins?
Ten grand.
Say what?
Ten grand.
If Pepe wins, the money's doubled.
Didn't I mention that?
Hands up, Pepe.
Come on.
Ma, get the music.
Pussycat, get some sleep.
The big fight's tomorrow.
Words that have echoed from mother to daughter since time began.
OK, so I don't turn a phrase like Harriet Nelson.
You still better get some sleep.
I can't, Ma.
I'm too nervous.
About the money?
No, Ma.
I'm always a wreck the night before any welterweight Division B match-up at the local arena.
Of course I'm worried about - Ma, how could you do this?
How could you gamble with our money?
Let me tell you a story, Dorothy.
Picture it - Sicily, 1920.
Two young girls pack their bags and leave their tiny village to seek fame and fortune and a meal cooked without oregano.
Their journey takes them to a seaside town where a ship prepares to depart for the New World.
They're just - The New World?
Anybody can say Baltimore.
There's an art to telling these stories.
Sorry.
Where was I?
Departing for the New World.
Oh, right.
Anyway, the price of steerage turns out to be 900,000 lire.
Or approximately a buck and a quarter.
Which is exactly the amount of each girl's life savings.
Exactly?
That's why this is a story instead of an immigration report.
May I continue?
One girl chooses to spend her money and take a chance on adventure.
The other plays it cautiously and books only a ferry to Sardinia, saving the rest of her money for a rainy day.
Lemme guess, Ma.
You were the one who chose adventure.
You also would've said Baltimore instead of the New World.
You're no good at this.
I'm the girl who played it safe.
Maybe if I'd made the other choice, I'd have been prime minister of Israel instead of my good friend Golda Meir.
Ma, you never met Golda Meir!
Please!
I almost married her husband, the man who perfected the hot dog.
Oscar Meir.
Ma, you're not making any sense.
All right, Dorothy.
Let me level with you.
All my life, I've been the practical one.
Your father was the dreamer.
So when this opportunity came along, I could hear his voice like he was standing next to me.
"Sophia, take a chance.
Go for it".
I didn't mean to hurt you, pussycat.
I guess I did it for your father.
Oh, Ma That's a load of crap.
I'm dancing as fast as I can, Dorothy.
Hey, I did a dumb thing, and I feel terrible.
What else do you want me to say?
At least it was a start.
You can also tell me again how everything is going to work out just fine.
Everything is gonna work out just fine.
All the Kid has to do is step into that ring tomorrow, and we'll make our money back.
Dorothy, he's gone!
What?
Pepe's gone!
I went to take him milk and cookies, and his room is empty.
He can't be gone!
We have to find him!
Sophia, where are you going?
Out the window before I'm thrown out.
On my own, at least I can tuck and roll.
Are you sure this is the right place?
No, but it was the only address we could find in Pepe's room.
I feel uncomfortable about going through Pepe's things.
Me, too.
Although it was kind of exciting opening his closet and seeing his little boxing trunks hanging there with that provocative nickname on 'em.
Blanche, Everlast is a brand name, not a nickname.
What kind of a place is this, anyway?
I don't know.
An old office building or a warehouse.
Looks to me like the kind of place where shady dealings go on.
I say we just forget our money and save our behinds.
Why?
You've got a lot more behind than you do money.
No, I'm with you.
I say let's cut our losses and get out of here.
Excuse me.
This is a private session.
What is going on here?
What does it look like?
The opposition kidnapped our fighter and is trying to turn him into a sissy boy by making him play the violin.
Come on, Pepe.
Ma!
Ladies, I guess I've got some explaining to do.
You sure do.
Like why you snuck out on us.
Like why you used us.
Like why you're speaking better English than Sylvester Stallone.
Pepe, what is this all about?
The violin.
In two days, I have an audition for the Juilliard School of Music.
Yeah, right.
And I'm Jimmy Swaggart's favorite way to pass a lonely afternoon.
No, it's true.
This is my teacher.
He's been coaching me in the evenings.
I see.
And is there anything else that you feel we're entitled to know before we kiss you and the $3,000 goodbye?
You'll get your money back.
I'm gonna fight tomorrow.
I need that purse in case I get into Juilliard.
You need a purse to go to Juilliard?
You understood more when he spoke Spanish, didn't you, Rose?
Frankly, I don't understand much, either.
Pepe, why didn't you tell us all this when Sophia first brought you home?
I was afraid you'd back out of the deal.
I needed your money for the entrance fee for the fight.
Entrance fee?
Oh, yeah, right.
Didn't I mention that?
No problem.
It comes out of Rose's share.
What about the Spanish?
Why did you pretend to only know Spanish?
Image.
Cuban boxers are supposed to know their right from their left, not much else.
And you think that we are that narrow-minded and prejudiced that we actually felt that way?
You bought into it, didn't you?
Hey, I didn't invent Kid Pepe.
I just conformed to your image of a simple-minded Hispanic fighter.
Well, I am a Cuban.
But hath not a Cuban eyes?
Hath not a Cuban hands?
Organs?
Dimensions?
Senses?
Affections?
Passions?
Fed with the same food?
Hurt with the same weapons?
Subject to the same diseases?
Healed by the same means?
Warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as you are?
If you prick us, do we not bleed?
If you tickle us, do we not laugh?
If you poison us, do we not die?
I also considered auditioning for the Actors Studio.
Why does every fighter become an actor?
Just once, I'd like it the other way around, if for no other reason than to see Chevy Chase get his butt kicked.
You can't fight.
You can't take a chance like that.
I have to.
I need the money for school.
What about your hands?
What if something happens to your hands?
They'll be fine.
And after tomorrow, I'll never fight again.
Or never play the violin again.
Excuse me.
Are we back to real life?
Or are the two of you performing a scene from Golden Boy?
Ladies, I've spent years working with this boy, watching him turn into a masterful musician.
You yourselves have heard how he makes the violin sing.
But his fate is in your hands.
Please Please don't make him step into that ring tomorrow.
You mean and lose all our money?
Yes.
That's the most touching thing I've ever heard.
I don't know what to say.
I do.
Fat chance, grandpa!
Oh, no!
What's everybody doing up?
We settled this.
The Kid wants to fight, and we need him to fight.
There's no problem here.
Everybody back to bed.
Ma, stop that.
We have to consider this very carefully.
We could be holding the man's fate in our hands.
I once held a man's fate in my hands.
I'm shocked.
It was back in high school.
I was dating the quarterback of the football team.
All the major colleges were trying to recruit him.
I was pretty sure he was leaning toward Notre Dame 'cause he asked me how to spell it.
But secretly, I was hoping for Alabama.
Going to Notre Dame would put such a wrench in our relationship, with all those priests skulking about the campus.
Anyway, one night, he told me he'd finally made his decision.
He was gonna enroll at the little junior college just 5 miles outside of town.
When I said, "Honey, why?
They don't even have a football team," he answered by slipping a ring on my finger and proposing marriage.
well, I could not believe it.
I sat there for almost half an hour just staring at that ring.
Finally I said, "Honey, this will not do.
I cannot accept this ring".
Because you loved him too much to stand in the way of his career.
No, because it was a piece of cheap glass, and the band was turning my finger green.
Well, no matter what your reasons were, you obviously made the right decision.
He probably went on to a very successful career in football.
Actually, he was so crushed by my rejection that he gave up football and turned gay.
You don't "turn gay.
" You're either gay, or you're not.
You had nothing to do with it.
Dorothy, if he had been gay before, he would have had better taste in jewelry.
That sure convinced me.
Let's get some shut-eye.
It's almost fight time.
Oh, Ma!
Dorothy, I'm not asking the Kid to win.
He has to step in the ring, and we make our money.
Sophia, if he steps in the ring, he might hurt his hands.
Unless it turns out that he's so bad that he gets knocked out before he can throw a punch.
Is everybody thinking what I'm thinking?
That that was a really mean thing to say.
As a general rule, Rose, you should not be the first to answer.
Rose, if we can convince Pepe just to show up there and get knocked out, everybody'll get what they want.
What if he won't go along with that?
We'll talk him into it.
There's no shame in taking a dive.
In Sicily, it's a time-honored tradition.
Pepe, could we have a word with you?
There's something we'd like to discuss.
Can it wait?
Right now, I've got a few things on my mind.
Like that big sucker over in the other corner?
That's right at the top of the list.
We want to talk about your fight strategy.
We have an idea.
Yeah?
What do you want me to do?
Fall down.
What?
!
They want you to take a dive.
Ma!
It wouldn't be a dive, exactly.
Just protect your hands by not using 'em.
If you get knocked out, you get knocked out.
I can't do that.
It's immoral.
Immoral?
What's so moral about two guys standing up in the ring beating each other bloody?
It just isn't fair.
To whom?
To the gamblers?
Gambling is illegal in this state.
Besides, you're such an underdog, even Benny the Weasel won't give odds.
I overheard that at bingo the other night.
This way, everybody wins, and nobody gets hurt.
What's wrong with that?
All right, I'll do it.
Great!
Hey, Pepe, your mother's a tramp!
I'm gonna kill you, Gonzales.
It's a good thing he doesn't play trumpet.
His lip looks like meat loaf.
Just relax.
Don't be nervous.
I'm not nervous.
Are your hands all right?
They're fine.
He never threw a punch.
That's all behind you now, Pepe.
This is the moment you wanted.
Good luck.
Before I start this piece, I just have one question to ask.
Do I play the violin?
Oh, no.
I'm afraid I can't remember the piece I'm supposed to play.
Look, this happens sometimes after a fight.
Can I come back tomorrow?
I'm afraid not.
You won't be eligible again until next year.
Jeez, I can't believe I blew it.
Pepe, it's not your fault.
They are not going to give you another chance because you're Cuban.
Huh?
Because you're Cuban.
Ohh Because I'm Cuban.
But hath not a Cuban eyes?
Hath not a Cuban hands?
Organs?
Dimensions?
Senses?
Affections?
Passions?
Fed with the same food?
Hurt with the same weapons?
Subject to the same diseases?
Healed by the same means?
Warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as you are?
If you prick us, do we not bleed?
If you tickle us, do we not laugh?
If you poison us, do we not die?
Brilliant!
Absolutely brilliant!
That was the finest audition for the acting school that we've seen all week.
Congratulations.
I'm so glad Pepe has the opportunity to be an actor.
Why?
When was the last time you saw a Cuban Macbeth?
He'll get out of school and spend his whole career getting arrested on TV cop shows.
Ma, you don't see the bright side of anything, do you?
No.
But I can fake a smile.
Congratulations, Pepe.
I'm so happy for you.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Thanks, honey.
Girls, you will never guess who I just got off the phone with.
Trudy McMann, your best friend from high school.
She's coming to Miami for your high-school reunion.
Sophia, that's incredible.
You must have ESP.
No.
I have a phone extension in my bedroom.
Ma, how many times do I have to tell you not to listen in on my conversations?
About twice a year.
Like your phone is ringing off the hook.
Like you got such a full social calendar.
You're the only person who ever got a refund on call waiting.
All right, Ma, all right.
Dorothy, high-school reunions can be so much fun.
I will never forget mine.
I was the most successful person there.
Blanche, didn't you go to school with that brilliant doctor who won the Nobel Prize?
Oh, yes, but she let her looks go to hell.
You do sound excited, Dorothy.
Well, I am, I am.
But mostly it's about seeing Trudy again.
A girl never had a better friend than Trudy McMann.
What, Ma?
Oh, nothing.
My underwear just hiked up on me.
Right while you were lying.
Ly - Why do you say I'm lying?
"A girl never had a better friend than Trudy McMann"?
Somebody here doesn't remember prom night, 1946.
Why?
What happened?
I don't know.
I'm that somebody.
No, I think what Ma is referring to  is a little practical joke that Trudy played on me.
All of us on the tennis team decided that we would wear our tennis whites to the prom.
Well, I showed up, and I was the only one.
Oh, no!
Your date must have been horrified.
No.
Her brother was a really good sport about it.
No, Trudy and I played a lot of practical jokes on each other.
It was all part of a happy, healthy rivalry.
Oh, I was the butt of all kinds of jokes growing up.
Actually, it ran in the family.
In our breakfast room, we had one whole wall covered with "kick me" signs we had collected.
Oh, there was a story attached to each one of them.
And in some cases, the original Scotch tape.
So when's Trudy coming?
Uh week after next.
Which reminds me, I have to rush.
Where to?
Tennis lessons.
I figure, if she's gonna be here, we ought to have a nice, quiet game.
Oh, that's sweet.
And a lot of crap.
I'm gonna mop the court with her.
Oh, my.
Looks like our Dorothy still holds a grudge.
'Course she holds a grudge.
We Sicilians are good at that.
That, and holding a grudge.
Sophia, you said "holding a grudge" twice.
Hey, if you're good at something, you brag about it.
I am so excited.
I can't believe I'm going to see Trudy again after all these years.
I'm excited for you, too, Dorothy.
That's why I want everything perfect.
I'm making Scandinavia's oldest and most traditional appetizer treat - cheese and crackers.
Cheese and crackers, Rose?
Not eggs gafloofen?
Ham and gunterhoggins?
Pigs in a svenkabluden?
No, but you sure know how to make a girl's mouth water.
Oh, my God.
That's her.
I sure hope time has been good to Trudy.
Good, not great.
Oh, Trudy.
Dorothy.
Oh  It's been so long.
Boy, you look It's been so long.
I know, and you - you look exactly the way you did at our high-school graduation.
'Course, rumors were that you were three months' pregnant.
I want you to meet my husband Jack.
You didn't tell me you had such a handsome husband.
Didn't tell you he was rich, either.
That's my Trudy.
You haven't lost your sense of humor.
Or those pesky ten pounds.
Mrs. Petrillo, is that you?
No, it's Jane Fonda.
Come on.
Give us a hug.
Aw, Trudy, it's so good to see you again.
Honey, meet my roommates - Rose and Blanche.
It's a pleasure.
Dorothy's told us so much about you.
All good, I hope.
Well, actually Sit!
Well, finally I get to meet the infamous Dorothy.
Boy, has Trudy told me stories about you two.
I'll bet she has.
We had such a great time back in high school.
Like the time you and Trudy ran against each other for class treasurer?
You know, back in St. Olaf, I ran for president of the Bull Castration Club.
There is no sound in this world sweeter than a bull's moo as it climbs an octave.
Did you win?
No.
Lost by a hair.
I admired you after that loss, Dorothy.
You just picked up the pieces and went on.
Just like you did after Stanley ran off with that stewardess.
Boy, I envy you your gumption.
And I your breast implants.
This may not be my place, but you two hardly sound like old friends.
Blanche is right.
We should be more positive.
Dorothy, you look wonderful.
Ah.
The left one turned out nice.
Dorothy!
Oh, come on, Rose.
I'm just kidding.
They're both practically the same size.
How about giving me a hand in the kitchen?
Were they like that in high school, Mrs. Petrillo?
Oh, no.
Her breasts were actually a lot smaller back then.
I meant, were they rivals?
What is this - Nova?
I don't have all the answers.
I'm afraid you'll have to excuse Sophia, Jack.
Oh.
You heard that?
I thought I was safe backed up against these pillows.
Why don't we see what's keeping Trudy and Dorothy?
Probably got caught up reminiscing.
You know how it is when old pals get together.
Excuse us.
Well, that's that.
How does it feel to have your butt whipped?
Well, sometimes I find it strangely titillating, but Oh!
You were talking to her.
Trudy, how about if tomorrow we play a real game?
Something that requires real skill.
You mean like midget ice bowling?
I'm talking about tennis, you doofus.
Aren't you afraid of being humiliated on the tennis court?
Me humiliated?
I think you forget, Trudy, we have to wear tennis dresses.
You're on, you pathetic middle-aged cow.
I am looking forward to it, you miserable sack of cellulite.
Did I tell you that Larry Prowse called the other day?
Really?
Did he ever get married?
Three times.
Actually four, if you count Victor.
Can you believe it?
Two women competing like that, and there's not even a man at stake.
In Sicily, women compete for everything.
The most famous example is the Great String-Cheese War of '47.
But why should I bore you with that?
You all have college credits.
You took history.
Sophia, have you been out in the hot sun too long?
It's a possibility.
Is there wax running out of my ears?
Boy, Trudy is beating the dickens out of Dorothy.
Oh I just have to catch my breath.
Are we gonna play, or do you wanna forfeit?
No way.
No, Dorothy Zbornak doesn't know the meaning of the word "forfeit".
And she's a teacher, too.
No wonder the Japanese are ahead of us.
I'm gonna kill you, Trudy.
Oh, do you really think she can make a comeback?
I'm sure she can.
Dorothy's running Trudy all over the court.
Oh, Trudy tripped.
And she's not getting up.
You think something's wrong?
I think she's fainted.
I hope it's not anything worse.
It is.
I've seen that look before.
You don't think?
There are two things in this world a Sicilian knows.
When pasta sticks to a wall, it's done.
When a body sticks to cement, it's dead.
Why did it have to happen this way?
I feel like a murderer!
I will not hear any more of that nonsense.
It was a freak occurrence on a tennis court.
She's right, Dorothy.
You did nothing wrong.
Technically.
I mean, nothing that would hold up in a court of law.
But why Trudy?
She was the most energetic, alive person I ever knew.
At the Center, Dorothy, we teach acceptance.
In life, some things are inevitable, and you just have to accept them.
She is right, Dorothy.
I know because I've been there myself.
You killed your best friend, too, Blanche?
Sorry, Dorothy.
I remember I was a blossoming belle who had just won the Little Miss Magnolia Pageant.
Blanche, before you start, realize I am very vulnerable now and in no mood to hear a story about you and some yahoo cracker with four first names pawing at each other under a magnolia tree.
Well, pardon me, Dorothy, but we can't all come from places as socially acceptable as Brooklyn.
I'm sorry, Blanche.
Go on with the story.
Just try to shy away from words like "tarnation" and "catfish".
Fine.
Anyway, I was about eight years old when I first met Cathy Lee on the playground.
We became fast friends, just as thick as Louisiana blackstrap molasses on a stake of johnnycakes as high as an elephant's knee On a riverboat floating down the Mississippi delta.
Finish the damn story, Blanche!
Anyway, it was at our Southern seafood fry that I proudly dragged Cathy Lee over to meet my folks.
My mama took one look at Cathy Lee and forbad me ever to see her again.
Why?
Because her mother was not in the Daughters of the Confederacy.
Oh!
How my heart went out to little Cathy Lee, standing there while our servants snickered at her servants.
But Mama insisted I break off the friendship, or I wouldn't get brand-new riding boots for Christmas.
So I did.
Blanche, why is this a story about acceptance?
Because years later, to get back at me, Cathy Lee slept with my daddy.
That was something I had to accept.
Mama accepted it, too.
Along with a brand-new Cadillac Eldorado for her birthday.
You know, my family had a few dollars, and I loved them dearly, but when you get right down to it, basically, they were trash.
Don't worry, Dorothy.
The reunion'll get your mind off of it.
People should be coming in a couple of hours.
The party.
The party!
I totally forgot!
There is no way I can face those people.
Honey, of course you can.
You were all friends of Trudy's.
You can console each other.
It'll help you to cope.
Maybe this is just what I need.
Aw, yeah.
Good for you, Dorothy.
Of course, breaking the news will not be easy.
Want my advice?
Wait a couple of hours before you do.
Stuff like this can put a real damper on happy hour.
And listen, Rose, remember, mum's the word.
Dorothy will break the bad news in due time.
OK?
Excuse me.
Has anyone seen Dorothy?
She said hello and then disappeared.
Is there a problem?
No!
No problem at all.
Everything's fine.
It's not like anyone died or anything.
It's so good to see everyone.
But where's Trudy?
She hasn't seen me in years.
I can't wait to see the look on her face.
You could wait six months, it wouldn't change.
It's been almost two hours.
We can't keep up this charade.
Somebody has got to get Dorothy to come out and break the news.
But she's so fragile now.
We have to be tender and compassionate, kindly and sympathetic and caring and understanding Stop babbling, you yutz.
I'll do it, I'll do it.
Picture it - Sicily, 1852.
Ma, I am in no mood.
And besides, you weren't alive in 1852.
What?
We can't learn from history?
It was mid-century and a disillusioned Italy looked to the house of Savoy for leadership.
Giuseppe Garibaldi, our courageous leader, and not a bad dresser, thought, "Let's regain some national pride and jump into this Crimean War thing".
Of course, there was a big kickoff party at Giuseppe's beach house, and everyone came.
Coincidentally, this was also the night his wife Rosa hit her sexual peak.
Ma, I am in here because of guilt.
This is not a story about guilt.
This is a story about being a bad hostess.
While Rosa had Giuseppe in the bedroom with his saber around his ankles, were strip-searching mice for a piece of cheese.
Ma, so what's your point?
That Rosa and I throw bad parties?
That's my minor point.
My major point is that, like Rosa, you're screwing around in the bedroom when there are important things to do outside.
I can't believe it.
That makes sense.
I mean, you went the long way around but that actually makes sense.
Look, pussycat, your friends deserve to know about Trudy.
And they'll understand, because they are your friends.
Oh, Ma.
Ma, thanks.
Well here goes.
Everybody Everybody, can I have your attention, please?
Uh I know I've been a bit scarce tonight, but there is a reason.
Something tragic happened this morning.
Oh, Ma, I need your help.
Sure, sweetheart.
Trudy's dead.
Please, everybody.
It happened this morning when we were playing tennis.
Trudy's heart just couldn't take it.
I'm so sorry that I dragged her out on the court and made her run back and forth so hard.
I wish it had been me instead of her, because it's all my fault.
We might as well take down that banner and put up one that says, "Welcome to the Dorothy Killed Trudy Party"!
Oh, darn.
Someone's late.
Dorothy'll have to give her speech all over again.
Hi, everybody!
Trudy?
I don't believe this.
Is that you?
In the flesh.
Yeah, but I can't believe you're really here!
I don't understand!
How did you?
It was all staged, Rose.
A patented Trudy McMann practical joke.
Well, I don't find that one bit funny.
It was cruel, Trudy.
Come on!
It was just a practical joke like we did in high school.
Some of the things we did in high school are not necessarily appropriate when we're adults.
Like staying up all night and carousing around, dating every other man you meet.
I'm losing credibility here, aren't I?
Trudy, you did a very cruel thing.
OK.
OK.
If I went too far, I'm sorry.
Maybe you ought to apologize to Dorothy.
She's back in her bedroom.
Uh, Dorothy?
Are you all right?
Go away.
Dorothy, honey, it's Rose.
We need to talk.
I said go away.
Leave it to me.
In a few minutes, I'll have her beaming from ear to ear.
Oh, my God!
Trudy!
Dorothy!
Jack!
How come you're alive?
How come you're in bed with my husband?
I asked you first.
Honey, it's not what it looks like.
Obviously.
Dorothy thought I was dead, tried to comfort you, and the two of you got carried away.
OK, it is what it looks like.
I can't believe this.
I was just playing a prank.
Do you have any idea how I feel?
What kind of person jumps into bed with her dearest friend's husband?
Not necessarily a bad person.
Sometimes circumstances Oh.
You were talking about her.
I think I'm gonna faint.
Gotcha!
Dorothy, what the hell is going on here?
Revenge!
It suddenly occurred to me - what if this was the ultimate practical joke?
So I dragged it out of Jack, and the two of us cooked up this topper.
Jack, I can't believe you went along with this.
So I got in bed with Dorothy.
It was a joke!
Don't even think it, Ma.
If you knew before, why didn't you tell me?
Ma, you have a big mouth.
Me?
If I had a big mouth, do you think your one-night stand with the bug man would still be a secret?
Oops.
Dorothy Zbornak, this is the most underhanded, sneaky practical joke anyone has ever made, and I have just one thing to say.
Boy, have I missed you!
Oh, Trudy Trudy!
I've missed you, too.
Wait just a minute.
You two are not mad?
Are you kidding?
Our friendship was built on years of this.
Trudy, you have made this one hell of a reunion.
Speaking of which, there's a party out there.
Come on!
Well, Dorothy Zbornak, I cannot believe you put Rose and me through this.
Yeah!
What are you talking about?
You knew Trudy was playing a practical joke all along, and you never shared it with your best friends?
We thought you were devastated.
We suffered right along with you.
Yeah!
That was insensitive.
Insensitive!
Selfish.
Selfish!
As far as we are concerned, Dorothy Zbornak, you have gone too far this time.
No.
This is unforgivable.
We are never gonna speak to you again.
Right!
Gotcha.
Very, very convincing, Blanche.
I can't take all the credit.
I did have some help.
Right, Rose?
Rose?
Rose?
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" I didn't know you were good at making malts.
Good?
I'm an expert.
Didn't I tell you I worked in a malt shop when I was in high school?
Soda jerk?
No, thanks.
I'll have a malted.
Oh, thanks.
Aren't you gonna have one, Dorothy?
Oh, no.
After you've worked in a malt shop, the greatest pleasure you can get is slurping up what's left in the blender.
Yum.
Is it any wonder I never breast-fed her?
What are you doing out?
I thought you were in your room.
I whittled a gun out of a bar of soap and overpowered the guards.
I went to the mini-mall.
They opened a Little Slice of Sicily pizzeria.
So I walk in, and this guy strikes up a conversation with me.
Turns out he owns the chain and wants me to be in a commercial.
Sophia, that's amazing!
I'll say.
It's rare you find anybody in a mini-mall who even speaks English.
OK.
OK, Ma.
Where are you going to shoot this commercial?
Well, we discussed many exotic locations, and we settled on right here.
Oh, now hold on.
I don't want a TV crew coming in here, messing up my kitchen, setting up all that video equipment.
How about shooting it in your bedroom, Blanche?
The equipment's already set up.
Blanche, I don't think you're gonna have to worry.
It's not gonna happen.
Has anybody seen a small bottle of pills?
Brown bottle, Patton's pharmacy label, your name on the prescription?
Yeah.
Never saw it.
Ma.
All right.
Yesterday, I was looking for the oregano and accidentally knocked them into the sink.
I forgot all about it.
Great.
Now I won't be able to refill the prescription till tomorrow.
Tomorrow's a holiday.
Pharmacy's closed.
Maybe I have another bottle in my room.
I can't understand how you could forget to tell Rose about that accident.
Forgive me, my memory's not as good as it used to be.
Nothing on me is as good as it used to be.
Once upon a time, I had a butt you could bounce a quarter on.
Now you could lose a Krugerrand in the creases.
Hello.
Oh, I'm sorry, I hope I'm not interrupting anything.
Dorothy, meet my director Sy Ferber.
Sy, my daughter Dorothy.
Daughter?
You're kidding.
Sy, I assure you, I won't be flattered if you say you thought she was my sister.
No, no.
I just had an idea.
Little Slice of Sicily is a family restaurant, and a mother-daughter commercial would be great.
How'd you like to be in it?
I don't know.
I'd have to check my schedule.
You see, I'm a substitute teacher.
Please!
So someone else sets up the driver's-ed cones.
All right, Ma.
Actually, Sy, I'd be delighted to do it.
Beautiful!
Guess what.
I'm going to be in that commercial with Ma.
Dorothy, I told you I don't want a bunch of strangers traipsing through my kitchen.
We'll pay you $1,000 a day.
Allow me to give you the grand tour.
Oh, no, don't come in here.
Everyone out!
What's wrong, Rose?
The slightest noise, and my humpaflagel cake will fall.
Oh, why, why, why?
Rose!
Honey, calm down.
You could make another cake.
Look, we're gonna set it up over here.
Dorothy, I'll put you here.
Sophia, I want you Excuse me, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
I'm very upset.
Rose!
This man is paying me $1,000 a day to make a commercial in my kitchen.
I live here.
I've every right to use this kitchen.
Miss, this'll only take a second.
It'll only take a second to knock you on your keister, buddy.
What's it gonna be?
Look, if I wanted this kind of abuse, I'd be directing The Roseanne Barr Show.
Oh, but, Sy Look, the commercial is off.
Just forget it.
Well!
Rose, now look what you did!
I didn't do anything wrong.
Rose, why are you acting like this?
I don't know what the hell you're talking about.
Get off my damn back!
Dorothy, what time is it?
Uh, 9:30.
Why do you ask?
Phyllis Gluckman is giving me a ride to my acting lesson.
If I'm gonna be in a commercial, I wanna be good.
What are you talking about?
The commercial is off.
No, it isn't.
I got the director to change his mind.
He's coming back here to shoot the commercial?
No, he doesn't want to get anywhere near Rose.
He's gonna shoot it at his studio.
But if he shoots it at his studio, then I get screwed and have nothing to show for it.
Welcome to show business.
Well, goodbye.
Hi, Sophia.
Later.
Hi, girls.
Oh, loved meeting your director friend yesterday.
Rose, are you all right?
Never better.
Why do you ask?
Maybe because yesterday you acted like a crazy person?
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.
I was a little on edge.
Don't worry, it won't happen again.
Rose, what are those pills for?
The doctor prescribed them when I wrenched my back.
I didn't know you'd hurt your back.
It's an old farm injury from St. Olaf.
I'll never forget when it happened.
It was time to plant the crops, but after 17 years of pulling the plow, poor old Bessie was worn out.
Why didn't you just get another mule?
Bessie wasn't a mule.
She was a big fat lady who pulled farm plows for a living.
For God's sake!
What about tractors?
Come on, Blanche.
If she was too old to pull a plow, how could she ever pull a tractor?
Anyway, we had to till the soil, so I volunteered to pull the plow, and I hurt my back.
How long have you been taking these pills?
I guess around 30 years.
Rose, I doubt that your doctor wanted you to take those things for 30 years.
What makes you such a medical expert?
The doctor prescribed those pills, and I only take them when I need them.
Have you ever considered the possibility that you might be dependent on them?
Are you calling me an addict?
I really resent that.
You think I can't do without those?
Here, you take 'em.
Oh, come on, Rose!
No, I insist.
Obviously you don't believe me.
This is the best way to prove it.
Rose, what the hell are you doing?
Oh, I couldn't sleep, so I decided to rearrange the kitchen cabinets.
I'm sorry I woke you.
Go on back to bed.
Rose, what are you doing with these?
Nothing.
You were looking for those pills.
Blanche, get rid of them.
You can't do that.
They're mine.
Get rid of them.
I thought you said you could take these or leave 'em.
That's true, and right now, I wanna take them.
Rose, you can't stop taking these pills.
You have a problem.
I can stop!
And I'll start stopping tomorrow.
Oh, boy, will you be proud of me.
You just wait.
Only I can't stop tonight.
Why not?
Because Because.
Because tonight is the anniversary of the death of my beloved cat Fluffy.
You have never had cats.
You're allergic.
OK, it's the anniversary of the death of my beloved brother Fluffy.
You're gonna have to do better than that.
Aw, give her some credit.
The woman has never told a lie in her life.
Nobody does it great the first time.
Look, the truth is I can't stop tonight because I'm afraid.
I don't know if I can.
That's because you're hooked on these, Rose.
But, honey, there's a place for people with this kind of problem.
Please, what is she gonna do in the NBA?
Rose, let us call a rehabilitation center for you.
No, I don't need one of those places.
I can't go to one of those places.
I'd be too ashamed, too embarrassed.
What is there to be ashamed of?
You have a medical problem.
Was Betty Ford embarrassed?
Was Liza Minnelli embarrassed?
She should have been.
Did you see Arthur 2?
Rose you have to do this.
No, I can stop by myself.
I can quit cold turkey.
Cold turkey?
After 30 years, doing it alone without professional help could be dangerous.
I won't be alone.
I'll be with you.
If you'll just see me through the night, I know I can lick this.
Come on, what do you say, girls?
Are you in this with me?
You bet we are, honey.
This is what friendship is all about.
Banding together when the going gets tough.
Sacrificing sleep and personal comfort.
Putting someone else's need ahead of your own.
It's beautiful.
Let me know how it turns out in the morning.
Think this is gonna work?
I don't know.
We should just go along with whatever she wants to do.
The important thing is to keep Rose's mind occupied.
Hey, give me some lipstick.
I'll draw a face on my hand.
What are you doing up?
I've got an hour till my paper route starts, so I thought I'd do some chin-ups.
I was worried about Rose.
I'm a member of this family, too.
I'm sorry.
Ma, that's really very sweet, considering we have to get up so darn early tomorrow for that commercial.
I said she was family.
I'd do anything for that girl.
Well, is everybody ready for a spirited game of Googenspritzer?
Googenspritzer?
You said we were gonna play Monopoly.
I said it was like Monopoly, only instead of Atlantic City, they use St. Olaf geography.
Well, I'll be the bank.
Oh, good.
There's the cashbox.
Honey, this is empty.
Oh, I know.
The St. Olaf Bank was one of the first savings and loans to go under.
Bad management?
Bad contractor.
They built the bank on marshland, and it sank.
All that was left were a few deposit slips and a pen with a chain attached to it, floating in the muck.
Amazing.
My story?
No.
My patience at this hour!
Can we get on with this?
OK, I'll go first.
Four.
Oh, it says, "Pick a card".
How odd.
I can either buy the library or the phone booth in the center of town.
I'll buy the library.
If I were you, I'd buy the phone booth.
Why?
People use the phone booth.
It's my turn.
Oh, six.
Ha-ha!
What luck!
I own Logenbeuton Avenue!
Ha-ha.
Game's over, I win.
You win?
Rose, how?
You bought one street in St. Olaf.
I bought the only street in St. Olaf.
That means I'm gonna tear down your phone booth.
This is the stupidest game!
I could just Dorothy, Dorothy.
I could just play all night.
Set it up again, Rose.
Rose, how about a piece of Bundt cake?
Oh, no, thanks.
I'll try some, Dorothy.
"Try some".
Right, like it's some big experiment, like you got no idea what it tastes like.
Like you don't shovel it in by the pound every chance you get.
Ma!
Girls, I really don't feel very good.
I gave this a shot, but I can't make it.
Rose, yes, you can.
No, I can't.
I can't, Dorothy!
It's too hard.
I wish you'd all stop acting like you know what I'm going through because you don't.
You don't have any idea.
Well, I might not have any idea what it's like to feel the kind of dependency you do, but there was a time in my life when I tried quittin' something.
Blanche, you don't mean?
Sex, Dorothy.
I tried quittin' sex.
Obviously you fell off the wagon.
And onto a naval base.
It was just after I'd lost George, and it just seemed an appropriate thing to do.
Of course it did.
Your husband had just died.
So what?
I hadn't.
The point is, I was still feeling a little vulnerable, and I was afraid if I got intimate with somebody too quickly, I might end up getting hurt, so I just gave it up, cold turkey.
And it worked for you, Blanche?
Well, not entirely.
Barely a month had gone by before I started feeling those awful stirrings and urgings.
I was like a spring-bloomin' peach bud just ripened to dewy fruition, waitin' to be plucked by the first handsome man to come my way.
You were looking for some nooky.
Exactly.
Then came the moment of truth.
There was a man, he asked me to sleep with him.
I said no.
But I knew something greater than my will power was necessary for me to resist him, so I called my sister.
Did she talk you through it?
Oh, better than that.
She drove straight over, took him by the throat, said if he ever tried that again, she'd shoot him through the head.
Just because he made a pass at you?
Oh, did I forget to mention that the man was my sister's husband?
I'm going to bed.
Ma, you can't.
Yes, she can.
We're not proving anything by sitting here any longer.
We might as well all go.
I can't believe I'm hearing this.
Does this mean you're giving up when you've gotten this far?
No, it means I can see the sun coming up over the Donaldsons' house.
It's morning.
We made it!
She's right.
Oh, that's wonderful!
Oh, congratula - I'll bet you feel better already.
Oh, I really do and mostly because you guys were there for me.
I'll never be able to repay you.
Think nothing of it.
We were glad to help.
Oh, I'm glad to hear you say that because if I can't sleep tonight, we might have to do it all over.
So, when I say, "action," you pick up the pizza, taste it and say, "Mmm, that's a mighty tasty pizza".
Is everybody ready?
Yeah uh, one thing.
Do I look at my mother or at the camera?
Look at the camera, and here's a little tip.
Look at it like you're making love to it.
It might help if you give her a reference she's more familiar with.
OK, this is a rehearsal.
We're gonna run through it once, and then we'll do it for real.
And go!
Guess what, Ma.
I found you some real good pizza like you used to get in Sicily.
Boy, do you stink.
Dorothy, Dorothy, relax.
Just try and be yourself.
You can do this.
I'm sorry.
I'll get it this time.
All right, here we go.
Everyone settle.
And go!
Guess what, Ma.
I've found some real Sicil No, that's not it.
What is the line?
"Ma, I found some real good pizza, just like you used to get back in Sicily".
Ah.
Sy, now I know what the trouble is.
There's something wrong with the line.
That's why I can't say it.
Something wrong with the line?
I'm an English teacher.
I should know.
The reason I can't say it is because the line itself is not grammatical.
See, it should be "really good pizza," not "real good".
"Perfect pizza with pizazz".
Even better.
Hey, I can act and write!
Gee, I love this business!
You don't mind if I make the change, do you?
No, not at all.
In fact, I think I want to make a change, too.
OK, Dorothy, let's see ya smile!
This one's for the camera.
And action!
Look, Grandma, I've found you a real good pizza, just like you used to get in Sicily.
Mmm that's a mighty That's a mighty lousy pizza!
Ma, you never tasted it before?
No, and I never will again.
What the hell are you doing?
Sorry, Sy.
You can't pay me enough to endorse that slime on a shingle.
Ma, this is a nationwide commercial.
There is a lot of money involved here.
Sorry.
There are two things a Sicilian won't do - lie about pizza and file a tax return.
Forget it, Sy.
Rose, spit it out!
But, Dorothy Right now, Rose!
This is Fred Flintstone.
His nose is dissolved, but it's definitely Fred Flintstone.
They're my vitamins.
I'm sorry I didn't trust you.
Don't apologize.
But I misjudged you, Rose.
No, you didn't.
Here are my pills.
I took one last night.
But, Rose, you got through an entire night without them.
I thought you had it beat.
So did I!
Dorothy, when you were staying up with me, I felt like I was safe, that I could rely on your strength to get me through it.
But, Dorothy, you're not enough.
These are even stronger than you are.
Honey, let me call a recovery center.
No, Dorothy.
Listen, this is not just gonna go away, Rose.
I know.
But I think the first step is for me to make that call.
Any sign of Rose?
Not yet.
You know, Dorothy, I'm a little nervous.
Rose was on those pills for 30 years.
If one month in the hospital has helped her kick the habit, she may not be the same Rose we know.
She may be an entirely different person.
I know because it happened to me once.
Before my mama sent me off to beauty camp, I was a pencil-thin, flat-chested, four-eyed nerd.
I don't believe it.
You pencil-thin?
Hi, girls.
Oh, my gosh, have we missed you!
Oh, Rose!
You look wonderful!
Gimme a big hug!
I'm so happy to see you!
Oh, sweetheart!
Oh, Rose!
It just must feel wonderful bein' cured!
Oh, I'm not cured.
What do you mean?
I'll never be cured, but I know now I can live without drugs my whole life, one day at a time.
I'm just glad you got that monkey off your back.
I never had a monkey on my back, Sophia.
Although, when I was a child, I had a chicken named Gordon.
Oh, and what a great chicken!
And he was a great singer, too.
Gordon could cluck the scores of all the big Broadway musicals.
I've heard a lot of poultry do show tunes, but nobody could hold a candle to him.
Of course, no chicken likes to be that near an open flame.
Same old Rose.
Same old Rose.
Oh, anyway, he was a great entertainer.
We thought for a while he was a great dancer, too, till we discovered he had two left wings.
He'd just shuffle along there.
Oh, how he loved music, especially Gilbert and Sullivan.
Oh
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Ma, did you have a sardine sandwich for lunch again?
Dreyfuss!
Ma, what the hell is Dreyfuss doing here?
Calm down.
I just ran into Harry Weston.
They're all leaving town, and they needed someone to watch Dreyfuss.
I volunteered.
Yeah, well, unvolunteer.
Why?
You think I can't do it?
You think I'm irresponsible?
Yes, Ma.
You think I'm forgetful?
Yes, Ma.
You think I'm irresponsible?
You already said that.
That's emphasis.
You never heard the "I have a dream" speech?
Ma, face it.
You cannot be trusted.
Every time you get yourself into something like this, I end up covering for you.
I am not gonna end up taking care of this dog.
Did I ever mention that I almost died giving birth to you?
The pain was so intense, they gave me a towel to bite on.
They gave you a towel at the hospital?
What hospital?
You were born on a pinochle table at McSorley's bar.
Hospital?
Like your father was a member of the Etna family.
The closest he ever got to a hospital was when he came to deliver ice.
Ma, guilt is not gonna work.
You're right, Dorothy.
I was naive to think you'd give an old woman one last chance to regain her daughter's respect.
Now I guess I'll just stick my head in the oven All right, Ma!
Maybe guilt will work.
But, Ma, this is the last time.
Oh, thanks, pussycat.
You won't regret it.
Now, would you mind taking him out for a walk tonight?
Ma, forget it, forget it.
The dog is all yours.
Oh, come on.
Why is there a big hairy beast in my house?
My guess is because he bought you dinner.
Well, Blanche, I gotta run.
Well, thank you for a lovely afternoon, Gary.
I hope I see you again real soon.
You can count on it.
Bye, Gary.
Well, you and Gary certainly seem to have hit it off.
Well, why shouldn't we?
The man's perfect.
He only owns the most successful chain of funeral homes in Greater Miami.
With this heat wave we're having, he's got 'em stacked up like firewood in all four locations.
Hi, girls.
Is she here yet?
Who, Rose?
My sister.
I left you a note on your bathroom mirror.
Why did you leave a note on my bathroom mirror?
It was the only one that had enough steam.
Which sister is this, Rose?
My younger sister Holly.
Frankly, I'm not too happy about it.
This is a terrible thing to say, but I don't really like her.
We haven't gotten along since we were kids.
Why is she coming here, then?
Well, she's here on business.
She's a world-renowned flautist.
She plays the flute?
No, Dorothy, she plays the flaut.
It's a Scandinavian instrument that looks like a tuba, except it's got hair on the bottom.
Of course she plays the flute!
I'm sorry, I guess I'm just a little wound up.
That's Holly now.
Will you guys help me through this?
Well, sure, absolutely.
Thanks a million.
God, I hate this woman.
Holly.
Oh, Rose!
Oh, Rose!
It's so good to see you.
You look just wonderful.
So do you.
Come on in and meet my friends.
This is Wait, wait!
Let me!
She's attractive, witty, and great fun to be with.
This must be Dorothy.
And she's smart, sexy and stylish to a fault.
This must be Blanche.
Did I get it right?
You're right.
Thank goodness.
I worried all the way over here I'd get it backwards.
I could have lived with smart and sexy.
You do live with smart and sexy.
Who's this?
Holly, this is Oh, wait, now, Rose, let me.
She's feisty, zesty, and full of old-world charm Sophia!
She's mopey, dopey, and full of crap, Rose's sister.
Don't mess with me, kid.
I have the home-court advantage.
Honey, what you looking for?
Nothing.
Now, Sophia, tell me the truth.
All right.
Dreyfuss is gone.
He ran away?
No, we had a falling out and agreed to a trial separation.
Of course he ran away.
When?
I'm not sure.
I have it pinpointed sometime between 10:15 today and late last Thursday.
You have no recollection of Dreyfuss since last Thursday?
I have no recollection, period, since last Thursday.
Anything could have happened in three days.
I just hope I'm not carrying Steve Garvey's baby.
Honey, listen, don't panic.
As soon as the girls get home from work, we'll fan out through the neighborhood and find Dreyfuss.
No go, Blanche.
I need to handle this myself.
Why?
Because if Dorothy finds out I lost Dreyfuss, she'll never trust me with anything again.
That's why I'm begging you.
Please, promise me, on your mother's grave, you won't breathe a word of this to Dorothy.
You promise?
Yes, sure, Sophia.
Good.
Now I can save what I know about you and the twin rabbinical students for another time.
Hi, Rose.
Hi, Gary.
Come on in.
I just wanted to drop off Blanche's earrings.
They must have fallen off in my car the other night.
I'll get Blanche.
She's in the kitchen.
No, don't do that.
Actually, there's something I want to talk to you about.
What is it, Gary?
Rose, I find you very attractive.
Much more attractive than most of the women I come in contact with.
Aren't most of the women you come in contact with dead?
What I was talking about is us.
Would you consider going out with me?
What about Blanche?
I think it would be best if she stayed at home.
Unless you know something that I don't.
You're disgusting!
Gary, hi!
What are you doing here?
I was just bringing back your earrings.
Well, I've gotta run.
Thank you.
See you Saturday?
You bet, darling.
Rose Nylund, if I didn't know better, I might think you were tryin' to steal my boyfriend.
I'm innocent, Blanche.
I know it.
That's why Gary's dating me.
Ha ha ha!
He's a lewd, horny, oversexed beast with five hands!
You don't have to build him up to me, honey.
I like him fine already.
It's 5:00.
Where's Holly?
Out with Dorothy, I think.
Still?
Oh, I'm gonna owe Dorothy big for this one.
You know something, Rose?
I don't think you're being fair to Holly.
Now I spent three afternoons with her this week, and she was lovely company each time.
Last night she even took me out to Antonio's.
Antonio's?
But that's right down by my office.
Why didn't you guys call?
Holly did call.
She said somebody said you weren't there.
But I was.
Well, I guess it was just a mix-up.
The point is, we had a terrific time.
I really like Holly.
Holly!
That has to be one of the funniest stories I've heard in ages.
Doesn't Rose ever tell St. Olaf stories?
All the time.
Hello, Blanche.
Hi, Rose.
Hi, darling.
Well, it sounds like you girls had a nice afternoon.
Nice doesn't begin to describe it.
We went shopping, we had lunch, we saw a movie, and we picked up theater tickets for tonight.
Oh, great.
What are we seeing?
Oh, I feel terrible.
See, you told me you'd probably be busy tonight, so I just got seats for Dorothy and Blanche and me.
Oh, well, honey, don't worry.
You can have my ticket.
Oh, no, Dorothy, that wouldn't be fair.
No, the three of you should go.
And we can meet for coffee afterwards.
Oh.
Great.
She's doing it again.
First it was Antonio's, then it was the tickets.
She's leaving me out intentionally.
Rose, they were just misunderstandings.
Now you're overreacting.
I guess so.
Oh, these things happen between sisters all the time.
I remember once my sister Virginia wouldn't talk to me for a month, all because I smiled at her boyfriend.
There.
Listen to Blanche.
Of course, I was skinny-dipping on his property at the time.
Don't listen to Blanche.
All right, it was his bathtub.
We were blowing suds off of each other when she walked in.
Blanche, what is the point of this story?
Point?
There's no point.
I just like telling it.
Well, Blanche, what do you think?
Sophia, what have you done?
Saved my puckered little Sicilian behind, that's what.
When Dreyfuss didn't come home again this morning, I went to the pet shop and got a duplicate.
Amazing, isn't it?
Yeah, except for one thing.
Dreyfuss came home this afternoon.
Holy cow!
Don't worry, just take that dog back to the pet shop.
I can't, the pet shop's closed till Monday.
Somebody help me with the groceries.
Oh, great.
That's Dorothy.
I gotta get both dogs into my room.
Come on, boys.
You know, Sophia, I'm not too sure that's a good idea.
Dorothy sees me with these two, she'll know I screwed up.
Yeah, but there's something I think you're not considering here.
Sophia!
Oh, dear.
Sophia, I think you're makin' a big mistake.
I just need to keep the new dog hidden till Monday.
It's a piece of cake.
That's not the mistake I mean.
With both those dogs in the same room, how are you gonna know which is the old one and which is the new one?
I'm screwed.
Oh, come on, help me with these.
We have to meet Holly at the movies in ten minutes.
OK.
I am so mad, I could spit.
Rose, what happened?
It's Holly.
Those directions she gave me for meeting you guys for lunch were totally wrong.
Come on, now, Rose, you don't think she did that to you on purpose?
Well, I do.
Oh, honey, that's silly.
You don't know Holly.
She just got her directions all mixed up.
It was a mistake.
Just like it was a mistake leaving me out of dinner at Antonio's, and a mistake leaving me home from the play?
Rose, you are overreacting to this.
Now calm down.
Let's just go and enjoy the movie.
What movie?
We're meeting Holly.
Didn't she mention it to you?
No!
And I'll suppose you'll say it's just a silly mix-up.
Well, I'm not falling for that again.
I'm not going.
Fine, Rose, fine.
But I do think it's time that you realized that Holly is a terrific person and would not do anything to hurt you or anybody else.
And the sooner you realize that, Rose, the happier we'll all be.
Come on, Blanche.
Another slice of cheesecake, Blanche?
Oh, I really shouldn't.
Honey, what harm can it do?
Lately you've been eating like a bird.
Yeah, Rodan.
Oh, girls, I'm so glad you're still up.
I need to talk to you.
I have a problem.
Oh, honey, we know you do.
You gotta stop buying your hair colorin' out of the 99-cent-or-less bin at the Pic 'n Save.
This problem has to do with Holly.
Her hair's not the color of a Twinkie.
Holly has done something terrible, Blanche, and I think you ought to know Listen, darling, whatever it is, I'm really not interested.
What?
Blanche and I have been talking about this.
There is a problem, all right, but it's not between us and Holly, it's between you and Holly.
Ever since she arrived, you've been trying to convince us that she's been doing terrible things.
And, Rose, it simply isn't true.
See, we happen to like Holly.
So, whatever the problem is, will you just kind of leave us out of it and you settle it with her, OK?
All right, Rose, out with it.
What did Holly do that's so terrible?
Why do you care?
You won't believe me anyway.
Hey, Sicilians can always recognize two things - when someone is telling the truth, and when they've had their fingerprints changed.
I know whatever you're gonna say is the truth.
This afternoon I saw Blanche's boyfriend, Gary Tucker, kissing my sister Holly.
Oh, please.
You're such a liar.
I swear on my mother's grave.
OK, OK, I believe you.
What should I do, Sophia?
Well, this is a very complex and perplexing question.
It has to do with honesty, friendship, love, hate all the biggies.
So what should I do?
Please!
Socrates sat under an olive tree in a sheet for years thinking about this kind of stuff.
I'm a poor immigrant with a third-grade education.
Give me two minutes!
Sorry.
OK.
I got it.
My Uncle Carlo always used to say, "Honesty is the best policy".
Of course, Uncle Carlo died a penniless drunk.
I don't understand.
The point is, if you're honest every second of every day, it doesn't always turn out for the best.
That was the case with my Uncle Carlo.
He honestly remembered the license number of the trigger man in the Sanducci vendetta.
So what you're saying is that because nobody's gonna believe me anyway, I'm better off if I let people find out what's going on for themselves.
I wouldn't chisel that into a stone tablet, but it sounds serviceable at this hour.
Oh, thanks a lot, Sophia.
Good night.
Uh, hold it, Rose.
I need some advice too.
You need advice from me?
Yeah, frightening, isn't it?
It's about Dreyfuss.
OK.
What about Dreyfuss?
The other day I thought he was lost, so I got a second dog, and then the first one came back.
Sophia, are you kidding me?
Come see for yourself.
Wow, two Dreyfusses.
No, one Dreyfuss.
I want to return the second, but I don't know how to tell which is which.
That's where you come in.
What do I do?
Well, there's only one thing I can think of.
We used to do it back on the farm, and I may be a little rusty, but it's worth a shot.
Whatever it is, do it.
I'm desperate.
OK.
Here goes.
Dreyfuss, come here, boy!
This one's Dreyfuss.
I don't get it, Blanche.
This isn't like you.
Come on, Gary calls at the last minute, cancels your date.
You're not the least bit upset or suspicious.
Well, Dorothy, give me some credit.
What kind of person would doubt a man whose mother needs emergency gallbladder surgery to save her life?
Besides, the hospital said the operation would take five hours, and that restaurant just would not hold our reservations past 8:30.
Blanche, Dorothy!
I wasn't expecting you home till later.
Well, I got off work early, and Blanche's plans were canceled.
So what are you up to tonight, Holly?
Oh, nothing.
Just a quiet evening at home.
Where did those pants come from?
According to the label, The Gap.
Hold it, Dorothy.
Don't you get it?
Holly has company!
Well!
Nice going, girl.
You're a pretty fast worker.
I guess that's something we have in common.
That's something else you have in common.
Gary Tucker.
You miserable, no-good lowlife!
You told me your mama was havin' surgery.
She is.
Blanche, please let me explain.
Why?
So you can make up some cockamamie story about how you're two ships that passed in the night and it'll never happen again?
Save your breath, I've heard all that before.
You have?
Yes, only usually I'm one of the ships.
Well, Rose, it's all out in the open now.
I can see that.
Holly, I'd like to speak with you in the kitchen, please.
Well, uh, I'll just grab my pants and go.
Holly Rose, I don't need a lecture.
It's over.
No, it's not.
I'll leave in the morning.
Obviously, I won't be coming back.
So that's where it ends?
Well, that's neat, isn't it?
You walk in here, borrow my friends for a while, then start acting like a stupid jerk and waltz right out as if nothing ever happened.
Do you want an apology?
I want an explanation.
Holly, I can't figure you out.
You're smart, you've got a career, you're attractive.
Why do you always have to act like such a jackass?
Maybe I just never learned to be the great person my big sister was.
Oh, Holly.
It's true, Rose.
You always had the friends.
I didn't.
You had boyfriends, girlfriends.
You were friends with every animal on the farm.
I never learned how to make friends.
You never learned how to keep friends.
You never thought of anybody but yourself.
It's about time you stopped looking around for other people to blame.
This is your problem.
Oh, I always used to feel so guilty for not getting along with you, but that's over.
Just because we're sisters doesn't mean we have to be friends.
I'd like to be someday, but you're gonna have to make the first move.
Goodbye, Holly.
Honey, are you all right?
I'm fine.
Oh, Rose, honey, can you ever forgive us?
Well, it all depends.
Will you believe what I say from now on, even if it isn't what you want to hear?
Oh, of course we will.
Will you believe me when I tell you that somebody isn't as nice as they seem?
Of course we will.
Will you believe me when I tell you about how our pig Lester always predicted the Best Supporting Actor Oscar winner every year since 19 Don't push it, Rose.
OK, I forgive you.
Oh, there he is.
I've been looking all over for that dog.
Harry Weston just pulled up.
Time for Dreyfuss to go home.
Now, see, that wasn't so bad, was it?
No, you're right.
Actually, he was very little trouble.
Yeah, no trouble at all.
Now come on, Dreyfuss, let's go.
Yo, Dreyfuss!
It's checkout time.
He's acting as though Dreyfuss isn't even his name.
Of course Dreyfuss is his name.
Right, Dreyfuss?
Dreyfuss!
Come on.
Maybe we'll swing by the pet shop on the way home.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Girls, I am so excited.
I just got a big bonus at work.
Ah!
And guess what I've decided to do with it.
What?
I'm gonna have my breasts enlarged.
You're not serious, Blanche?
Oh, sure I am.
Breasts are back in fashion.
And what God didn't give me, Dr. Myron Rosensweig will.
Oh, that man is the Picasso of plastic surgeons.
Just be sure he doesn't attach one of them to your forehead.
Yes.
Hello.
What's shaking?
Blanche's breasts.
That's why she's gonna have 'em Shut up, Rose.
Ma, I haven't seen you all morning.
Where have you been?
I went to see my friend Lillian.
Lillian, at Shady Pines?
Oh, you remember Shady Pines?
That retirement home you stuck me in that resembled Sing Sing.
My mistake, Sing Sing has a movie night.
Sophia, how is Lillian?
I don't know.
She wasn't there.
There was someone else in her bed.
It was weird.
Lillian?
Oh, did you say Lillian?
My God, you got a call about her this morning.
I was so caught up in my breasts, I totally forgot.
It happens to all of us, Blanche.
That's why my rent check was late.
It's from your friend Gladys at Shady Pines.
She says Lillian was sent to Sunny Pastures.
You see, Ma, your friend is fine.
Fine?
Are you kidding?
Sunny Pastures is the worst nursing home in the city.
It's every old person's nightmare.
That, and a childproof cap on the Kaopectate bottle.
Ma, if it's licensed by the state, your friend will be just fine there.
You don't understand.
It's where people wind up when they can't afford a place like Shady Pines.
It's the bottom of the barrel.
I have to see if Lillian is OK.
What?
Ma, wait.
If it'll make you feel better, I'll take you.
Oh, good.
Now while we're there, will you promise you'll hold my hand the entire time?
Oh, Ma, are you really that scared?
No.
I just wanna make sure you're not grabbing at brochures behind my back.
Oh, Rose, hi.
Listen, I just picked up these pamphlets at a cosmetic surgeon, and I want you to help me decide which alterations I'll get.
Blanche, none of these women have any tops on.
Well, I know, honey.
These are the "after" pictures of satisfied customers.
I was thinking about having my breasts done like hers.
All right, Blanche, but do you think black really suits you?
I was talking about the shape.
See, these are regal and dignified and upscale.
And 50 percent off.
Dr. Rosensweig over-ordered on the Vixen 3 model.
Blanche, are you sure you're not being a bit silly?
Why?
Let me tell you something.
When I was a schoolgirl, I developed early, and all the boys noticed and hit on me.
Not one boy was ever interested in my mind.
Get outta here.
It's true.
But you, Blanche, I mean, men are drawn to you because of your charm and your wit and your zest for life.
I mean, you can have the operation or not.
Men won't care one bit about your breasts.
Really, Rose?
Not with me around.
Oh, hi, girls.
Did you all find Lillian?
You bet we did.
And that Sunny Pastures was everything that Ma said it would be.
And how.
There was crud on the floor, rats in the hallway, and 60 people to every blanket.
It wasn't fit for human life.
Although, in my village in Sicily, it would have been a two-star motel.
Ma, you're exaggerating.
But not by much.
It was pretty bad.
Boy, when you hear horrible stories like that, it brings up so many questions.
It sure does.
Why do we let things like this happen?
Why can't we care for our elderly the way they do in Japan?
Why are there 17 sets of hooters on the coffee table?
Those are mine, Sophia.
Oh, well, let me put on my big surprised face.
Oh, I just wish there was something we could do for the poor thing.
There is.
I wanna sort of adopt Lillian, visit her often.
I'm gonna need rides.
Oh, you can count on us, sweetheart.
You sure can.
Absolutely.
Now, come on, it's getting late.
Let's get dinner, hmm?
Notice how they seem to follow you wherever you go?
This is it, Sophia?
Well, this doesn't seem so bad.
Believe me, you have to get into it more before you realize how bad it really is.
Just like War and Remembrance.
Excuse me, ladies, but visiting hours are over.
Oh, then I guess we'll just come back No, we don't.
We're not here to visit.
We're not?
No, we're here to see about checking in Mom.
You two are sisters?
Uh It's a long, involved, and somewhat sordid story.
If you want to get a clearer picture, I suggest you rent the cassette of Chinatown.
Sophia, what's going on?
It's a little surprise.
We're not visiting Lillian as much as we're breaking her out.
What?
We can't do that.
I mean, that's wrong.
What if we get caught?
Lillian is a great friend.
Will you do it, please?
Well, OK.
Good.
I'll keep the staff busy, you get Lillian.
She's down the hall, last door on the right.
Go.
Hello.
I'm John Porter.
I'm in charge of admissions.
Oh, yeah.
Hi.
I wanted to talk to you about my mother.
About checking her in?
No, about her collection of commemorative plates.
Of course about checking her in.
She's 125.
You can't pry the yogurt out of her hands.
Uh, I'll get the papers from my office.
OK, Sophia.
Let's go.
Go where?
That's not Lillian.
You said you were Lillian.
You think I'm in here because I'm good with names?
Rose, try again.
She's in bed 68.
Now hurry.
Come on, honey.
OK, let's fill this out.
Uh, please.
Um And you are?
Sophia.
Sophia Pe Hawkins.
OK, Mrs. Pehawkins, um Maybe you can tell me about your mother's history?
Picture it.
Sicily, 1900.
An olive-skinned woman sets sail for the new world.
I was talking about her medical history.
So was I. You think that was a pleasure cruise?
There was smallpox, scurvy, typhoid.
And that was business class.
What I need to know is, does your mother require any special medical care?
She does.
Uh An old war injury.
Remember the Maine?
She didn't.
She was a frogman and swam right into the bulkhead.
They put a metal plate in her head, and now she gets HBO through her eyeballs.
Don't look at me like that.
If Tyson has another fight, you may wanna set her up in the rec hall.
This is all hard to believe.
If it's not true, my name isn't Sophia Pehawkins.
Excuse me.
Rose, what the hell is going on?
I ask for Lillian, you bring me Eubie Blake's parents.
What's wrong?
They were the only other people back there.
There is no way Lillian is in this ward.
Hi, Sophia.
What are you doing here?
Oh, Lillian.
Thank God I found you.
I'm taking you away from here.
You are?
How are we gonna get out?
What about them?
Leave it to a pro.
Runaway wheelchair!
Runaway wheelchair!
Wait a minute!
Come back here.
Oh, hi, Blanche.
How was your appointment with Dr. Rosensweig?
Well, I was so nervous that I just rushed right in there and pulled off my top, and said, "Well, what do you think"?
What did he say?
He said, "I think you're probably looking for Dr. Rosensweig".
"But if you ever want a discount on life insurance, call me".
Oh, boy, do I need a cup of coffee.
What's the matter?
Oh, this whole Lillian thing.
The woman was up all night.
Ma is exhausted.
Oh, this is all my fault.
Ah, well.
Don't worry about it.
At least I called the home and checked her out for a week's visit.
So we're not kidnappers anymore.
Ma, sit down.
Ma, we need to talk about Lillian.
I said I'll take care of her.
Ma!
I already take care of you three, so I'll do a little more cleaning, a little more cooking, and make up one more bed in the morning.
Sophia, you don't make my bed.
I know.
It's impossible to put a fitted sheet around a big, hairy guy named Ed.
Hello, everyone.
Isn't it a lovely morning?
It sure is, sweetheart.
How about some pancakes?
Again?
We had pancakes yesterday.
Lillian, you weren't here yesterday.
Here you are, honey.
A nice cup of tea.
Lillian, Sophia tells me that you were in the Ziegfeld Follies.
Oh, yes.
Those were the days.
You must have been something.
I was quite a looker.
Almost as pretty as you.
Why, thank you.
Of course, I had bigger breasts.
Sophia, do you think I could take a bath before breakfast?
It's been a while.
Let me help.
She's my friend.
I wanna help her.
Oh, it's just wonderful to think about, isn't it, the two of 'em together?
And they're so cute.
Thinking about your breasts again, aren't you, Blanche?
I don't know this place.
Lillian, it's OK.
And I don't know you.
Lillian, I'm Dorothy.
And this is Sophia.
We're your friends.
We brought you here from the home last night.
Oh, OK, right.
I'm sorry.
Now, why don't you go and take that nice, hot bath?
Come on, sweetheart.
Ma, maybe you need a break.
Why don't you sit this out?
What?
Like I can't handle it?
Like it's too much for poor old Sophia.
Like I'm so ancient, I don't have the energy.
Get the lights on your way out.
Well, I guess it's my shift.
It's OK, Dorothy.
I think she's finally asleep.
Oh, thank God.
I am exhausted.
I haven't been this tired since my wedding night.
Well, a night of unbridled passion should take it out of you.
Who said anything about passion?
I was tired from picking up beer cans from Stan's poker buddies.
I just cannot believe Lillian's only been here 24 hours.
I cannot believe that Ma thought she could handle her alone.
It's almost too much for the four of us.
This just makes me so mad.
I mean, people like this really need help.
Then there are places like Sunny Pastures.
Well, there weren't any Sunny Pastures in the South.
At least, not when I was growing up.
I remember this one old man.
His name was Ben.
All he did all day long was sit out there on his family's front porch in that old hickory rocking chair and whittle.
Just whittle.
I used to pass by there on my way home from school, and I'd say, "Hi, Ben".
And he'd yell back, "Hi, Blanche.
Stay away from my grandsons".
Anyway, I realized that Ben could spend all his days happy, whittling away, because his family was there for him.
I will never forget that look on his face.
He was happier than a Kentucky yearling frolicking in blue grass as high as a hoot owl's perch on the top of a spring In English, Jethro!
In English!
He was happy.
Anyway, Ben got older, and I guess a little bit frail, and This is the hard part of my story.
One autumn day, I walked by that porch and old Ben was gone.
I bet he died in the bed he was born in.
No, he was sent up the river on a morals charge.
Are you OK, Sophia?
You're awfully quiet.
What?
Oh, it's just that talking about Lillian makes me think about the future.
Oh, Ma.
Honey, you have nothing to worry about.
Who said I was talking about my future?
You three aren't exactly spring chickens, you know.
She's right.
One way or another, we're all in the same boat.
I know, but right now, our big problem is Lillian.
We obviously can't take care of her, and Sunny Pastures is not doing its job.
What are we gonna do?
I know what I'm gonna do - make Sunny Pastures do its job.
I'm gonna see the man who runs that place and give him a good what for.
I can be pretty mean and pretty tough when I want to be.
There's only one thing I'll need.
What, Dorothy?
My mother to come with me.
No, no, no, no.
I have the purchase order right here in front of me.
This was your mistake, and we're not paying for it.
Problems, problems, problems.
The world is bringing me problems.
And you are?
We are the world.
I'm Dorothy Zbornak.
This is my mother Sophia.
We're here to talk to you  Hello.
No.
No, I did not order It was 40 bedpans.
I'm sorry.
You were telling me?
What we wanted to talk to you  Sorry.
Hello.
Oh, good.
Tell 'em to drop it off at the south end loading dock.
Right.
I'm so sorry.
It's always like this.
You were saying?
Mrs. Zbornak?
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I just figured if I opened my mouth that the phone would start ringing.
Anyway, what I  That's OK.
I'll just let it ring.
We're here because we have a very dear friend who is a patient here, and we have some concerns.
She's a lovely old woman, very sweet and very kind, and we would really hope that in some way, you know, you could Dammit!
Will you answer the phone?
Uh-huh.
Bill the insurance company first.
The state takes care of the rest.
So, you have some concerns about Sunny Pastures?
Actually, they're more like complaints.
Oh, complaints?
Oh, well What you need to do is fill out these forms and mail them back to me.
Yes, and then what happens?
Then it goes right here into my inbox.
This is outrageous.
Lillian's problems cannot wait that long.
She is old, she is sick, and she needs better care right now.
I agree.
What?
Look, ladies, Sunny Pastures doesn't operate at a profit.
Our patients' social security and Medicare pay most of our bills.
The government subsidies pick up the slack so we can meet minimum standards.
Then maybe minimum standards aren't enough.
Right again.
And this year, the government's made cutbacks.
We're operating in the red and doing the best we can.
Are you telling me that nothing can be done?
Look, I'd love to help your friend.
I'd love to help all our patients.
And if you have any ideas on how to make it better, I'm all ears.
Hello.
Well, girls, how did it go?
Terrible.
I can't believe you live and wind up in a place like Sunny Pastures.
I guess money makes the world go round.
Hey, you live 80, 90 years, just getting up too fast makes the world go round.
Hi, everyone.
Where's Lillian?
I have some really good news.
She's napping.
What news?
Well, I spent the day going around town, and I think I found the perfect place for her.
Really?
Well, it's not as nice as Shady Pines, but the staff really seems to care, and the patients are happy.
Rose, that is fantastic.
And it won't cost any more than Sunny Pastures?
Well, that's the one little problem.
Lillian's benefits won't quite cover the costs.
She'll need another $150 a month.
Little problem?
Rose, how could you get our hopes up like that?
I mean, who has an extra $150 a month?
I do.
What?
I do!
We'll use that bonus check I got at work.
But, Blanche Don't try and talk me out of it, now.
My mind is made up.
Blanche, are you sure?
Sure, I'm sure.
Lillian ought to be covered for two years with that money in my bosom account.
Blanche, I'm proud of you.
But why the sudden change of heart?
Oh, well.
I guess this cosmetic surgery business is pretty trivial, really.
I'll do fine with what God gave me.
Having Lillian here made me realize that my problems are pretty trite.
I suppose something like this does make your breasts seem rather small.
Well, sort of.
Well, then.
That's that.
Lillian's problems are solved.
Isn't this terrific?
Terrific?
Ma, this is wonderful.
I mean, this is a real happy ending.
So, how come I don't feel all that happy?
I don't know.
Is it because we know that Lillian's just plain lucky?
That a lot of old people do slip through the cracks and are forgotten?
And maybe it may not be too long until we're elderly ourselves?
I know, girls.
Let's make a pact that we'll always take care of each other.
That we'll never desert each other, no matter what.
You can count on me, honey.
Do you think it's gonna be that easy getting rid of me, Rose?
That was rhetorical, Rose.
Ah, but what a comforting thought, knowing you'll never be alone.
And listen, what the hell?
If we do have to go to a nursing home, let's all go together.
But what happens when there's only one of us left?
Don't worry.
I can take care of myself.
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Hi, Ma.
What are you eating?
Ziti.
Ma, it's nine o'clock in the morning.
You're eating a bowl of pasta?
No, I'm eating a bowl of Nabisco Zitios.
Of course I'm eating pasta.
I need to gain weight.
I'm wasting away, Dorothy.
What do you mean?
I got weighed this morning.
I couldn't believe what I saw.
98lbs.
What do you usually weigh?
Ma, you lost one pound.
Thank you, RenÃ© Descartes.
I'm looking for advice, not arithmetic.
Ma, you cannot get upset over one pound.
Maybe you can't.
I can.
For 50 years my weight hasn't changed by an ounce, and as far as I'm concerned, until I'm back to 99, I'm no longer Sophia Petrillo.
Morning, Dorothy.
Morning, Sophia.
Who?
Dorothy, do you realize it's only two weeks till Phyllis's Memorial Day beach party?
There's only two weeks till we have to get back into bathing suits again.
Well, I just slipped into last year's bikini and I think I look pretty good, but you give me your honest advice.
Can I still pull it off?
Right now I'd be surprised if you could cut if off.
Are you implying that I might have gained weight?
There's only one way to find out.
Here's the scale.
Oh, fine.
Whoa!
Sophia, were you looking?
Uh, no, not till you stepped off.
But I know it's not a good sign when the first rebound goes into the low 120s.
Blanche, honey, don't worry.
All you need is a little spring tune-up.
And I suppose you don't?
No, not really.
Prove it.
Put your money where your mouth is.
If there isn't already a sweet roll there.
All right, all right, but, now, nobody look.
I always thought you had to pass zero to hit that number.
Obviously the scale is broken.
I'm not surprised after that kind of punishment.
Rose, you think you're so tiny, why don't you get weighed?
Oh, I don't need to.
I never gain weight.
Show us, Rose.
Well, OK, but I can promise you I weigh exactly the same as I did on my wedding day.
Moo!
Obviously we all need to lose a few pounds.
We might as well start right now.
It's still two weeks until Phyllis's party.
Oh, but how?
We could try another health club.
Oh, no way, Rose.
I'm sure you haven't forgotten what happened that time we tried that.
Remember the outfits we ended up with?
Oh, Lord have mercy.
This seems like a nice club.
But it's for women only.
What's wrong with the nice coed gym we just saw?
Come on now, Blanche, that was nothing but a pickup scene.
People running around in skimpy outfits, collecting phone numbers.
That's not true.
I was not in a skimpy outfit and I got all these.
Hello.
My name is Yvonne.
Have you been here before?
See?
You go to a woman's gym, you get hit on by a woman.
I work here.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to imply anything.
She just thought you were a lesbian.
Yvonne, we want to join a gym.
What kind of exercise are you interested in?
Nothing radical, just to lose a few pounds Tone up.
Slim down.
Get into my summer wardrobe.
Get into my winter wardrobe.
Get into my bathrobe.
Yvonne, we are desperate women.
You've got to help us.
I know just what you need.
Aerobics.
It's what I do.
But, Yvonne, you're much younger than they are.
I know you'll love aerobics.
It stretches every muscle in your body.
Honey, I've been stretching this body for years.
Blanche, sticking your feet out of the sunroof of a Chrysler New Yorker doesn't count.
We have a beginners' class starting in 15 minutes.
With some hard work, your body can look as good as mine.
All right.
We better get you some outfits.
Oh, it's OK.
We brought our sweats.
Sweats?
Look, ladies, if you're serious about training, you want to get off on the right foot, starting with good workout shoes.
Now, these are beautiful, and a bargain at $85.
$85?
That's a bit exorbitant.
And expensive too.
We do have cheaper brands, but anyone who's serious wouldn't even go near them.
Then we'll take those.
Fine.
You'll also need aerobic suits, warmup outfits, wristbands, headbands, leg warmers.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Leg warmers?
You need to keep your thighs warm.
What are you using now?
Friction.
That's why we're here.
Ladies, I'm sorry.
When you told me you were serious, I took you literally.
Just forget this stuff.
Wear your sweats.
Oh, no, Yvonne.
We want all that stuff.
We do.
We really do.
Well, I don't.
I'm gonna stick with my sweat suit and my PF Flyers.
I'll see you girls in the locker room.
Yvonne, she's not serious.
Never has been, never will be.
OK, then you'll need new gym bags, water bottles, vitamin packs, and most importantly, a sports training bra to minimize jiggle and bounce.
Yvonne, honey, I think you're missing the whole point of having breasts.
We'll take them.
Great.
Nice outfits, girls.
Shut up, Rose.
I'm Yvonne and this is it!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Whoo.
OK, everybody, let's warm up.
Whoo!
Whoo!
And stretch.
Legs wider.
Oh, ow.
That hurts.
I'm not having any trouble.
Why is it that doesn't surprise me?
OK, everybody on their feet.
Whirlybirds.
Whirlybirds.
Jackhammer.
Jackhammer.
Windshield wipers.
Windshield wipers.
Charley horse.
Charley horse.
She has a cramp, you pea brain.
All that money and we only went twice.
Can you believe it?
What are you cooking now, Ma?
A Petrillo family delicacy.
Double-fudge, amaretto, ricotta cheesecake.
What's in it?
This cake is guaranteed to make me gain back that pound.
Ma, all this eating you're doing is ridiculous.
Now, I am sure you are already back up to 99lbs.
We'll see.
Wrong again, Kreskin.
Still 98.
I can't remember the last time I weighed 98.
Probably college.
Where'd you go to college, Blanche?
The University of Jupiter?
Girls, we still have one big problem to solve.
How are we gonna make ourselves look good for the party?
How else, Rose?
By dieting.
It's gonna take a little patience and a little determination, but mostly it's gonna take willpower.
We are facing some long, painful, hunger pang filled nights.
Who wants to lick the spoon?
I do.
Maybe we could just change our hairdos.
Now, we cannot do that, Dorothy.
I'm still trying to recover from the last time.
Remember, about the same time of year - two years ago, was it?
That little dinky place.
Gee, Ma, I don't know if this was such a good idea.
I think you're right.
Maybe I should've done my own hair.
I've been doing it for years.
That's why it looks like something you buy on a stick at halftime.
Sophia, we're just a little bit nervous.
This is a very important event.
We want to look perfect.
Please!
The man works with scissors, not a sandblaster.
Ma, this is all a mistake.
We don't belong here.
This is one of those Miami Beach shops for little old ladies.
Come on, let's get out of her All right, ladies.
Whose hair do I wash next?
Mine.
I'm first.
I'm the dirtiest.
Oh, God, you are gorgeous.
Yes, I know.
I am Eduardo.
Eduardo, tonight is important to us.
We want to look our best.
Don't worry, ladies.
After Eduardo does a woman's hair, the years melt away.
She's transformed into a breathtaking, sensuous, vivacious goddess of beauty.
I tried to get all that on the sign, but they charge by the letter.
We should begin by your telling me what you would like.
Here.
I have a picture.
This is not you.
You are a vixen.
For you, I see a saucier cut.
An Audrey Hepburn look.
Simple, elegant, and something to accent these delicate features.
Can you really do all that?
My dear, in many respects, styling hair is like making love.
To do it well, one must have trust, respect and a chair you can pump up and down.
I am your clay.
Mold me.
Not so fast, Eduardo.
What are you going to do with me?
You have good bones.
Yes, this is a strong, noble face, full of wisdom and sincerity.
You could be a Greek goddess.
Go on, Eduardo.
I said go on, Eduardo.
Give him a break.
He barely got it out once with a straight face.
What about me?
Could I be a goddess too?
No, no.
You are an earth mother.
Sweet, compassionate, but bubbling with sensuality just below the surface.
Oh, that's a relief.
All this time I thought it was gas.
Ladies, it's time.
Time to walk through the looking glass.
Time to take that last glimpse of your former selves.
Time to take that giant step into the world of Eduardoism.
You've been drinking again, haven't you?
Right.
The magic begins.
Oh, I'm feeling younger and sexier already.
Dorothy, how do I look?
Like something that came out of the air duct of the starship Enterprise.
What?
What?
Ladies, it's time.
Time for the unveiling of another Eduardo masterpiece.
Sit back, feast your eyes, and meet the woman you always dreamt you could be.
Eduardo, you've done it again.
And again.
And again.
Sophia, I still cannot believe you talked us into that.
Please.
You three looked gorgeous.
We didn't even look like ourselves.
What's your point?
Ma, you are not helping matters.
We are trying to think of a way we can make ourselves look better for that party.
OK, let me think.
It's too bad we're not back home.
There's no place like Sicily.
Why do you say that, Sophia?
Because in Sicily I could solve this with one phone call.
To whom?
Nicodemo the Ugly.
Whenever you wanted to look gorgeous at a party, you hired him to be your date.
You mean women paid him to stand next to them at parties and look disgusting?
Please.
They paid through the nose.
That's also how he usually gave them their change.
Girls, maybe we don't even need to worry about our bodies.
At the counseling center, we teach people that changing their dispositions can sometimes be just as effective in making a good impression.
Rose, if you're thinking of one of those personality-enhancing exercises, you're forgetting we tried that already once too.
And I'll never try that again.
Remember?
Three years ago.
It seems like yesterday.
Damn!
What's the matter, Pussycat?
I can't balance my checkbook.
Oh, to hell with it.
I'm only off by a few pennies.
A few pennies.
To you it may not be much, but in Sicily a few pennies could make the difference between owning a gun and having to insert bullets into your victim manually.
OK, Ma, I'll try it again, but believe me,  there's nothing in this world I hate more.
I spoke too soon.
Hi, babe.
It's me, Stan.
Wait, let me rephrase that.
It's me, the new Stan.
What are you talking about?
Don't you notice a difference?
Can't you see the glow?
Can't you see the light radiating off me?
Sure.
It's the porch light glaring off your head.
I thought I heard a man's voi Oh, it's you, Stan.
I'm so happy you're all here.
I have just had an incredible experience that I wanted to share with my dearest friends.
So what are you doing here?
I just finished a seminar with an encounter group called Realizations.
Realizations.
Let me guess.
It's a group that promises to remove all emotional blocks, self-denial and lifelong hang-ups in two days.
Miss Know-It-All, for your information it takes three days.
So what did it do for you?
I've learned a hell of a lot about what makes Stanley run.
Why I'm so reluctant to make commitments, why I can't keep friends, why all my business ventures seem to fail.
I finally have an answer.
Because you're a schmuck?
Did you take this seminar?
Stan, I think we've heard enough.
Look, I've gone through a life-changing experience.
I feel like I'm free to love anybody.
Oh, please.
You said the same thing after you had your vasectomy.
That's OK.
In Realizations, I learnt that people usually hurt each other unintentionally, therefore they deserve a second chance.
I hate you.
Nothing can bother me.
Not now.
I'm in a fellowship that accepts me, cares for me and loves me.
They'll always be there for me, and I'd like to enroll all of you in that fellowship.
No.
But you've got to.
Why?
Because if I don't meet my quota for enrolling new people in this loving, accepting, caring fellowship, they're gonna kick me out on the street and never speak to me again.
Please.
At least hear me out.
All right, Stanley.
We'll listen to what you have to say.
Beautiful.
How about we all go someplace and get comfortable, get some coffee, have something to eat?
I'll go change.
Why?
We're only going into the kitchen.
Boy, I hope you have some cheesecake.
Stan, that's it.
I've had it with your freeloading.
Get out.
Dorothy, you have so much hostility, so much aggression, so much mistrust.
This problem goes deeper than I thought.
I'm gonna need a steak with that cheesecake.
Get out!
Dorothy Out!
I'll just leave you the brochure.
Can you believe that man?
He actually thought he was gonna help us.
Well, he did have one good idea.
What was that?
Cheesecake.
You know, Dorothy, to this day I cannot understand what you saw in that man.
Picture a man 20lbs lighter, long, wavy hair, rippling muscles.
I can't believe Stan looked like that.
He didn't.
Do you think if I ever met a man who looked like that, I would've married Stan?
Maybe we shouldn't be so tough on the guy.
This brochure actually looks interesting, once you get past the picture of the guy in the turban waving from the front seat of the Rolls-Royce.
Sophia, those things are just silly.
"The unexamined life is a life not worth living".
That's very deep.
And if you're into this, very reasonable.
It's 17.95 for that slogan printed on a turban-shaped night-light.
Oh, that is so typical.
All those swamis are just out for a buck.
They can't teach you anything that anyone with any common sense doesn't already know.
I didn't know that.
A visual aid.
Oh, really, Ramdas?
If it's all so easy, let's hear you answer this question.
"Describe your best friend".
Dorothy, that's a really good question.
Oh, yes, and I'd love to hear the answer.
Well, my best friend is a woman, someone I have a great deal in common with.
Is she pretty?
Yes, she's attractive.
Attractive as in wholesome?
Or attractive as in drop-dead stunningly gorgeous?
Attractive as in attractive.
All right.
What else?
She's someone I share my innermost secrets with in strictest confidence.
You mean like the time you told me you borrowed Blanche's car, dented it, and said the bag boy at the grocery store did it?
That's not a secret.
I just forgot to mention it.
I think she means more like the time she told me that she went skinny-dipping with your cousin Lars before he gave up the pulpit back in St. Gustave.
That's a better example of a secret.
Oh, then you have been talking about me.
I'm your best friend.
She's been talking about me, Blanche.
I haven't been talking about either one of you.
What?
I've been talking about both of you.
I mean, how could I chose between you two?
You're both my best friends.
Dorothy, how sweet.
Oh, that just gives me a warm, tingly feeling all over.
If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go slip under the covers and enjoy it.
OK, Dorothy, she's gone.
You can tell me the truth.
You were talking about me, weren't you?
That's OK.
It'll be our own little secret.
That, and the dent in Blanche's car.
Got you.
You are such a liar.
What?
Neither of them is your best friend.
Admit it.
I'm your best friend.
You're right.
I was talking about you, Ma.
You are my best friend.
Just like I'm your best friend.
Best friend?
Please.
You aren't even my favorite child.
When you were 13, there were neighbor children I liked better.
Best friend.
How about picking up a tab once in a while, pal of mine?
Or letting me open my own social security check?
Best friend!
Yeah, right.
That little exercise certainly did not enhance things around here.
Oh, I wouldn't say that.
After Ma blabbed the truth, you turned the silent treatment into an art form.
Oh, there's my cake.
Oh, Ma.
Now, you cannot eat cake after that big bowl of pasta.
It's not healthy.
Sophia, I just thought of something.
You're worried about losing a pound.
Have you ever thought you may not be the same height you always were?
You know, Ma, Blanche could be right.
This could be exactly why you're losing weight.
Come with me.
Remember the first week you were here, we put a mark on the back wall to measure how tall we were?
You said they did that at the home to show how your height was declining.
Oh, Blanche is right.
You are a little bit shorter.
You don't have to worry about losing weight.
And you don't have to eat that cake.
Why do I get the feeling you three are most happy about the last part?
Oh, you mean us have some cake?
Honey, we can't do that.
We're dieting.
Sure smells good though.
Looks even better.
Bet you it tastes even better than that.
You three are dieting.
I'm throwing it away.
Don't!
Oh, girls, we can't do this.
Now, remember the party.
It's two weeks from Saturday.
No, it isn't.
This year Phyllis moved it to Sunday.
Then we have an extra day.
We can worry about our bodies tomorrow.
I'll get the plates.
I'll get the forks.
I'll get the hot fudge.
I'll get the butter.
We may have to grease the doorway to get the three of you out of here.
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see the biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Dorothy, give me a seven-letter word which means: "lonely, middle-aged woman desperate to meet men".
Is that a clue on your crossword puzzle?
No, I'm getting you a personalized license plate for your car.
Here you go, sweetheart.
Dorothy, have you ever heard of something called dirty-dancing?
Well, of course, Blanche.
They did it in that movie.
What movie?
Lawrence of Arabia, Rose.
This flier that came in the mail says they're gonna start a dirty-dancing course down at Lawson's dance studio.
What do you say, Dorothy?
Oh, no.
I can't see myself swinging my hips and wildly gyrating my pelvis.
I am not interested.
And the world heaves a collective sigh of relief.
Rose, how about you?
You wanna learn dirty-dancing?
I don't know.
For some odd reason, dirty-dancing always sounds dirty.
Come on, Rose.
You know you like dancing.
I like square-dancing.
This is just like square-dancing.
All right, count me in.
Oh, great.
Just one thing.
When you do-si-do, your legs are wrapped around your partner's neck.
Oh, look.
It's a letter from my friends Philomena and Dominic Bosco in Sicily.
Oh.
They're visiting Miami with their daughter Gina.
Who are they?
Oh, well, Gina and I were born within minutes of each other at the same hospital in Brooklyn.
That's when Ma became friendly with Philomena, before the family moved back to Sicily.
Will the Boscos be staying with us, Sophia?
Unless there's a bidding war with the neighbors.
Well, even if we lose, at least they'll be close by.
Don't worry.
They won't be any trouble.
They'll all stay in my room.
Oh, Ma.
Three people in one bed?
What'll the Boscos say?
If you throw in a goat, they'll say, "This is just like home".
Hi, Ma.
Here.
I wanna know what you think of my pasta pesto.
It's for the Boscos.
They'll be here any minute.
Ma, this is awful.
I'm also boiling the crud off the sink stop.
Try the other pot.
Hello, Dorothy.
Hi, Sophia.
Hi.
Tell me, how did the class go?
Oh, not so bad, really, although it was harder than I'd expected, but I'm sure that in time I'll be able to master the technique and absorb the subtleties.
She stunk.
But the teacher said I was a natural.
Let me get this straight.
Blanche couldn't get the hang of dirty-dancing but you could?
Dorothy, now do you see why I'm so embarrassed?
Can you imagine a dance with movements just like making love, and I can't do it?
Relax, Blanche.
Maybe standing up is what's throwing you.
There are the Boscos.
Philomena!
Sophia!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh, this is such a warm, wonderful moment.
Oh, I just wish I spoke Italian so I'd know what they were saying.
So good to see you, Sophia.
So good to see Oh!
And this must be Dorotea.
You know, you probably don't remember, but over 50 years ago I held you naked in my arms.
And you peed on his suit.
It's OK.
Look.
You can hardly see it anymore.
Oh, let me introduce my friends.
This is Rose and Blanche.
Oh, what a charming old world couple.
Welcome to Miami.
Questa mi sembra una donna di strada.
What did she say?
Er, she says she wants to thank you for your gracious welcome.
Oh, my Italian must really be rusty.
I could swear she asked if you were a streetwalker.
Tell me, where, uh, where is Gina?
Isn't she with you?
She's outside.
She's bartering with the cabby, you know.
Imagine a man who take cash over a rooster.
Well, tell us, now, what brings you all to Florida?
Well, we are here to take our daughter back to Sicily for her wedding.
Yeah, but Gina came with you.
Gina is not our daughter.
She's not?
No.
You are our daughter.
Please, ignore him.
The man spent 90 days on the high seas drinking grain alcohol from a goat bladder.
Dominic speak the truth.
After Gina take a blood test for her marriage we find out it is not possible she is related to us.
At the hospital there must have been some mix-up.
You mean they switched the babies?
Oh, but this is ridiculous.
Absolutely.
We can prove it.
Dorothy, show 'em your driver's license.
Look.
Look, I know this is a shock, but it gets better.
You are getting married.
To the most handsome man in the village.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
There is not one shred of evidence, not one logical reason, why I should not believe that this woman is my mother or that Gina is her real daughter.
Buongiorno.
I'm Gina.
Oh, Ma, that's disgusting.
Can't you find a better place to clip your toenails?
Don't call me Ma.
Call me Sophia like my other friends.
Look, Ma, I am very upset, so please stop teasing me.
Dorothy, I've never told this to anyone before.
The day I left the hospital with you, I had a gnawing feeling in the pit of my stomach.
Because you suspected I wasn't your daughter?
No, because I was in labor for 38 hours.
And the doctor bought his obstetric tools from a restaurant supply store.
Now, stop talking crazy and go to bed.
Good night.
Dorothy, you got a cough drop?
No.
A hard candy?
No.
A Tic Tac?
Does it say Kmart on the back of my nightgown?
As a matter of fact, it does, you cheapskate.
You know, Ma, I remember when I was a little girl-- Oh, God.
I used to have these terrible nightmares - monsters in the closet - and you'd always let me sleep in your room.
You remember, Ma?
And I remember how you and Pop would get me to stop crying.
You'd put your arms around me and kiss me and say: "As long as you're in my arms, everything's gonna be OK".
Ma, that's what I need now.
A parent to hug me and tell me everything's gonna be OK.
Don't worry, baby.
Everything is gonna be molto bene.
What the hell is going on here?
I heard your voice in the hallway.
I wanted to see why my bambina was up so late.
Don't call me your bambina.
Dominic, you wake the bambina!
Stop saying that!
Don't raise your voice at your mama.
You're not too old for me to take you across my knee.
You lay a finger on me, your teeth will be back in Sicily before you are.
That's my girl!
You've got lots of spirit just like your beautiful mama.
Thank you.
This has gone far enough.
What's gone far enough?
I was talking to her.
Look, from now on she'll be Ma number one.
You're Ma number two I'm slowly going out of my mind.
All right.
Enough.
Tomorrow I'll go to the hospital and have a blood test and settle this whole mess once and for all.
Capeesh?
Now, go to bed.
Oh, thank heaven this'll all be settled tomorrow.
Thanks, Ma.
Oh, I love you, Ma.
Ma.
Ma?
Are you talking to me?
But Blanche-- Don't even speak to me.
What you did was terrible.
I've never been so humiliated in my entire life.
That's not true.
What about the time you got caught with the Orkin man?
Don't comfort me, Rose.
All right, girls.
What happened?
Blanche and I went dancing.
She was sure she could out-dirty-dance me, even though I am better in class, so we went to a club.
Well, I got up first, and I was pretty good and then Blanche got up.
And she was bad?
Well, I couldn't tell.
I was blinded by the reflection off some gold chains on a guy named Mick.
But I think the laughter spoke for itself.
That's enough, Rose.
Dorothy, what are you doing up?
Oh, I couldn't sleep.
I just keep thinking about Ma and whose mother she really is.
You're worried she might be Gina's?
No, I'm worried she might be Phil Rizzuto's.
I've noticed the phrase "holy cow" creeping into her conversation a lot.
Oh, Dorothy, you have nothing to worry about.
Blanche, of course I do.
I am confronting the possibility that the woman I have lived with and known and loved for my entire life may not even be my mother.
Honey, that's exactly the point.
What's the difference if she did or didn't give birth to you?
You two really know each other and you really love each other - a lot more than most mommas and their children ever do.
Nothing that has happened or will happen can ever change that.
Of course, I could be wrong.
Excuse me.
Would you like a cup of coffee?
Oh, no, thank you.
The vending machine gave me two by mistake.
Hospitals.
Nothing ever works the way it's supposed to.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Just because a hospital vending machine screws up a lousy cup of coffee doesn't mean the hospital did anything wrong.
Oh, sure, a mistake like getting two babies mixed up makes the headlines.
But the point is - statistics back me up - hospitals are remarkably efficient institutions.
I mean, seriously.
How often does a hospital mix up two babies?
Have you ever heard of such a thing?
Well, have you?
Are you here for the methadone program?
I'm sorry.
I'm here for my mother.
Surgery?
No.
Blood test.
Oh.
You?
I have someone going into surgery.
I can understand why you'd be a little nervous.
No matter how many times you have to go through something like this, I guess you're never really prepared for it.
Look at me.
My hands are shaking.
I'm sweating.
My head is spinning.
I wish I could be only a little nervous.
Dr. Watkins to OR.
Dr. Watkins to OR.
Well, that's me.
I have to run.
Ma, what took you so long?
All they did was draw a little blood.
At my age, that's like wildcat-drilling for oil.
Ma, when are you gonna get the results of the blood test?
I'm a nervous wreck.
It'll only take a few minutes.
Relax, would ya?
Oh, Ma, how can I relax?
Any minute now somebody can walk in here and tell me you're not really my mother.
Let me remind you of something that may set your mind at ease.
Are you going to tell a story?
No, I'm gonna sing a Negro spiritual.
Shut up and listen.
Do you remember the first day you went to school?
No.
I do.
You looked so adorable in that pink and white polka-dot dress.
I loved that dress.
Even after you outgrew it, it was tucked away in an upstairs closet for years.
You put it away for sentimental reasons?
No, your brother Phil hid it there.
He used to like to wear it when he visited the firehouse.
Anyway, we got to the school and I walked you to your classroom, and as I turned to go you started to cry, "Mommy!
Mommy!
I want Mommy".
But the teacher told me to go, so I did, and I left you there screaming, crying, with the tears pouring down your face.
I guess all kids go through that the first day of school.
No, you were the only one.
It took a good half-hour to calm you down, but that didn't last long.
Oh.
What happened?
Every time the teacher turned her back, little Debbie did something she shouldn't.
Of course, her mother was the same way every time her father turned his back.
The woman was a real tramp.
Yeah.
But, uh, you digress.
Right.
So, there's Debbie putting gum in your hair, hiding your lunch, stealing your toys when no one was looking.
When I come to pick you up, I figure you'll say you never wanna go to school again.
But what do you tell me?
You love it.
You made a new friend named Debbie.
Ma, what the hell does this have to do?
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
How did you know what happened?
If the teacher didn't see Debbie-- I saw.
I stood at the window and watched you for four hours, in case you needed me.
You didn't?
No big deal.
Any real mother would do that for her kid.
Mrs. Petrillo?
I have the result of your test.
Thanks.
Let's roll.
I'm really looking forward to dance class today.
I can see that.
You're wearing your heat-seeking stretch pants.
Blanche, you're not dressed for class.
That's because I'm not going.
Why not?
Why not?
I will tell you why not.
Because I cannot flounce around a dance floor like some cheap trashy slut in heat.
Lord knows, I've tried.
Blanche, look-- Rose, please.
I do not need a lecture.
I am a klutz.
I can accept that.
I guess it's no big thing.
You're just awkward when it comes to your body.
Say what?
You have no coordination.
Obviously the stories about all your romantic escapades have been greatly exaggerated.
Just what is that supposed to mean?
Blanche, if you can't do a simple dance, how do you expect me to believe that story about you and the Flying Fanelli Brothers?
That was all true.
To this day I get flushed every time I pass a junglegym.
Oh, come on, Blanche.
That story is no truer than the one you told about you and Buzz in the lunar module.
Oh, that does it.
Rose, I would never lie about the US Space Program.
Awkward when it comes to my body, huh?
No coordination?
You wanna see a body defy the laws of nature, physics and Dade County?
You just hit that music, girl, and follow my lead.
Look into my eyes.
Rose.
Hi, girls.
This is not what it looks like.
What they do is their business, but if I ever see your hand on Rose's behind it'll kill me.
Ciao, everybody.
We gotta catch a boat.
Oh, Ma, they're leaving.
We're taking our daughter Gina back home to marry Guido.
Your daughter Gina?
Well, what about Dorothy?
Dorothy.
What'd they say about the blood test?
We didn't wait around for the results.
I don't need a blood test to tell me who my mother is.
A mother is someone who raises you and loves you and is always there for you.
I don't need any more proof than that.
Me neither.
I raised her, and I was the one who got her through that awkward period.
The 50 toughest years of my life.
That's the same way we feel about our Gina.
It's not that it wouldn't be nice to have you as a daughter, Dorotea, but we love Gina.
And so does Guido.
He wrote us he could never love anyone but Gina.
He wants us to return her to him right now.
Dorotea, I am so sorry we put you through all this.
You would have made a wonderful daughter.
But then, you already have - for your mother, Sophia.
Arrivederci.
Ciao.
Ciao.
Ciao.
Oh, what sweet people.
Oh, I hope everything works OK for Gina.
Why shouldn't it?
She's got a man waiting for her back home who owns a goat.
In Sicily that makes you a yuppie.
You know, Rose, all that dancing has just done wonders for me.
I feel so energized.
I feel so alive.
I feel like working this body up into a manic frenzy.
Well, great.
We still have time to get to class.
Who cares about class?
The circus is in town.
I say we go look up the Flying Fanelli Brothers.
How about a cup of tea, Ma?
Hm?
Good idea, pussycat.
Ma, you never thought I wasn't your daughter, did you?
Of course not.
Because if you wanna check the results-- Oh, don't talk crazy.
Go on and make the tea.
I'll be right in.
What have you got there?
Nothing.
Ma, when you said you forgot your keys and you went back into the waiting room, you got the results of the test, didn't you?
What if I did?
Let me see the lab results, Ma.
Mrs. Petrillo to you.
Then I'm not your daughter.
Got you, Dorothy!
It was just a shopping list.
You have absolutely no sense of humor.
Just like your uncle Vito.
At least, I think he was your uncle Vito.
Kidding.
Just kidding.
{END OF EPISODE 24}{START OF EPISODE 25}
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see The biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" This was a lovely afternoon.
Oh, I'll say.
I just love the legitimate theater.
You know, I missed Mr. Lee J. Cobb in Death of a Salesman.
I missed Mr. Marlon Brando in Streetcar Named Desire.
Well, I was damned if I was gonna miss Mr. Dick Butkus in Pal Joey.
And there's a brand-new water heater in the garage and wall-to-wall carpeting in all the bedrooms.
Ma, what the hell are you doing?
Selling the house.
And that's a working fireplace, and with these cathedral ceilings, you could stack 50 VCRs if you wanted to.
So, you think it over, and if you're interested, give us a call.
I make offer now.
If you like, you call me.
Sophia, honey, you can't just sell my house.
Is this in dollars?
No, it's in cucumber rolls.
Of course it's in dollars.
Sophia, what's this all about?
You tell me.
I'm not the one who put the for-sale sign on our front lawn.
What?
Oh, damn!
Those Donaldson boys must have moved that sign from the MacKenzies' front lawn and stuck it on ours.
Then this is all a mistake.
Yeah, but this sure isn't.
Oh.
Blanche, what do you mean?
Would you seriously consider selling the house?
Well, no.
I mean, I don't think so.
You have to admit this is an awful lot of money.
Frankly, more than I think the house is worth.
And as your agent, three percent of it is mine.
What do you say, Blanchey?
Do we close the deal?
Oh, I just don't know.
This is all so sudden.
There's so many things to consider.
Oh, look, Blanche, if you're worried about us, don't be.
I mean, just because you're selling the house doesn't mean that we can't all find another place together.
Oh, I wasn't worried about you.
I was worried about the tax consequences of all this extra income.
I'm kidding.
Oh, I love you.
You're my family.
Listen, we're sticking together no matter what happens.
I don't know.
It might be hard to find a place as perfect as this was for the four of us.
Oh, hell, if we did it once, we can do it again.
All we need is a little luck.
It was luck that brought us together the first time.
I will never forget when I first put up that notice at the supermarket.
Remember?
Are you OK?
Oh, I'm fine.
Oh, I know exactly what you're going through.
I can read it in your face.
You can?
Oh, sure.
Your husband or your boyfriend dumped you.
Honey, don't let it get you down.
It's just the nature of the beast.
They'd do it in the mud if they had to.
You just go sleep with his best friend.
That'll even up the score.
Am I on Candid Camera?
You mean, you didn't get dumped?
Well, actually, I did.
By my landlord.
He threw me out of my apartment, but I couldn't sleep with his best friend.
He's over 80 years old and thinks he's the Archduke Ferdinand.
Why did he throw you out?
Well, the new owners of the building don't allow cats and I'm not about to part with Mr. Peepers.
Oh, I guess you two have been through a lot together, huh?
Yes.
I found him last week.
But I wouldn't feel right having a home if he didn't.
We've become very attached.
You know what I think?
That shows great strength of character.
I like you and I like cats.
I also happen to have a room for rent, and the name is Blanche Devereaux.
Why would you name a room Blanche Devereaux?
Oh, it's been such a lovely day.
Mr. Sunshine really gave us one of his biggest and brightest smiles.
Oh, I feel like putting my arms around Mother Nature and giving her a big kiss.
Hi, you must be Dorothy.
And you must be Mrs. Rogers.
I didn't catch your name.
I'm Rose Nylund, your new roomie.
Blanche has told me all about you.
Sorry your husband dumped you.
You can borrow my bubble bath any time you want.
That'll help ease the lonely nights.
Thank you very much.
I see you two are getting acquainted.
Yes, I'm just gonna take my stuff to my room.
It's the second on the left down the hall there?
Dorothy, the second on the left is mine.
Blanche had promised it to me.
Blanche promised it to me too.
Didn't you?
Whoops.
Oh, great.
Great.
What are we supposed to do now?
Back in Minnesota, we'd settle this kind of a dispute with some good-natured logrolling.
Sorry, Rose.
My log is in the shop.
What do we do now?
Toss a coin?
OK.
All right.
I'll take tails.
OK.
Tails.
You win.
I'll make it up to you, Dorothy, I promise.
Listen, if there's ever a night where you can't sleep, I'll come to your room and sing "Kum Ba Ya".
Rose, I don't know what to say.
Yes, I do.
Don't ever do that.
It just doesn't seem possible that five years has gone by since we moved in together.
It's gonna be rough if we have to go our separate ways.
We've all learned to depend on each other so much.
Especially Rose.
What's that supposed to mean?
Oh, honey, it just means that sometimes you tend to be a bit naive, simple, childlike.
She's calling you a moron.
You don't want to live with a woman like that.
Tell her to sell the house.
Ma.
Oh, yeah?
Well, it just so happens that there are a lot of things I can do better than you guys.
Name one.
Can you tighten a horn on a helmet?
Smoke a herring in a pine log?
Check a bull for a hernia?
I guess the really rough part is getting him to turn his head and cough.
Come on, Rose.
Pick a category we can compete in.
All right.
What about that dance marathon?
Whose butt got whopped that night?
How did you know that Wally Oh, you mean at the actual dance marathon?
That's right.
Seems to me I showed you two guys a thing or two that night.
Ladies and gentlemen, our charity dance marathon is now entering its seventh hour.
Let's give our contestants a great big hand.
Hi, girls.
How are you holding up?
Oh, fine.
Just doing fine.
Terrific.
You know, this reminds me of the big dance back in St. Olaf to kick off Pretzel Week.
My Uncle Gunther, after the great Beer Nut shortage of '29 Foul!
Foul!
Send the judge over here.
This woman is trying to put us to sleep.
You're just exhausted and you're trying to blame it on me.
Exhausted?
I'll show you who's exhausted.
Maestro, how about something with a little octane?
OK, little lady.
All right, boys, take it away.
A one, two, a one, two, three, four.
Out of my way, amateurs.
Blanche, do you mind if I give it a try?
Oh, for heaven's sake, go on.
No, Dave, I better do this by myself.
You might get hurt.
Three, four.
Girls, I'm really worried.
Usually, by the time I've finished a cheesecake, I can solve any problem I'm trying to beat, This time I'm coming up empty.
Then why is the top button on your skirt open?
I'm talking about selling the house.
I just don't know if it's the right thing to do.
Well, honey, you don't have to decide tonight.
You should take all the time you need.
The point is, if you turn a nice buck on this place today, you can buy a bigger and better place tomorrow.
But I'm not sure I want to go right out and buy a new house.
Maybe I want to take some time to travel first.
I have relatives scattered all over this country I don't get to see very much.
If it's relatives you want, you should stay right here in Miami.
Howard Johnson's does less business than this house has over the years.
That is true.
We've all had our share of family showing up.
I think things are going very nicely.
Save it, Ma.
I am going to tell Uncle Angelo the truth.
It's only for a couple of hours more.
Ma, I can't do it.
I mean, pretending we're married, acting as though nothing happened, it's making me crazy.
It's time to take my heart medicine.
You need a glass of water to take your pill?
Not pills.
I'll take a shot of Scotch, Uncle Angelo, I have a confession to make.
Good.
I get my Scotch, we go in the closet.
No, it's about Stan and me.
You know something, Dorothy?
On your wedding day, Sophia told me she said your marriage was never gonna last.
That made me very sad.
And now to see you and Stan so happy after all of these years, it does an old man's heart good.
And so does that.
Uncle Angelo I'm so glad I disobeyed the doctor's orders and risked this long trip to see the both of you so much in love.
Now, what were you saying?
Uncle Angelo, I wanted to say Well, don't just stand there, Papa Bear.
Come give Mama Bear a big bear hug.
Can I get you another slice of cake, Uncle Angelo?
No, thank you.
I'll take a slice darling.
No problem, sweetheart.
Hurry back, dumpling.
My feet have wings, barf bag.
Dorothy, please hang in there a little while longer, and Angelo will be on a plane headed for Brooklyn.
Wish I'd taken my raincoat.
Why are you two dressed like that?
Well, these are our costumes for the play, Dorothy.
We were in the middle of dress rehearsal when they told us all to go home right away.
There's a hurricane heading for Miami.
You know, I think I will take a slice of cake Hello.
Uh, Uncle Angelo, I'd like you to meet um uh I'm Sister Rose.
Piacere.
Nice to meet you.
I'm Sister Blanche.
Nice to meet you, Sister Blanche.
We're here, uh, collecting lingerie for needy sexy people.
I just heard on TV the airports are closed.
There's a big hurricane headed this way.
They want everyone to stay just where they are.
That means that we could be trapped together for days!
Oh, Jesus!
Please protect us and watch over us in this, our hour of need.
Amen.
Ah, Lucy.
Hi.
Aunt Blanche.
Get in here.
I want you to meet my friends.
This is Sophia and Dorothy and Rose.
Nice to meet you, Lucy.
Let me get a look at you, girl.
Mmm, terrific little figure, gorgeous hair, perfect skin.
Just like looking in a mirror.
Get some Windex.
How was your trip?
Oh, it was wonderful.
I met a gorgeous, single doctor on the plane.
At 30,000 feet, she picks up a doctor.
Now I see the family resemblance.
In fact, I'm supposed to meet him in a half-hour, if that's OK.
But, darling, you just got here.
Aunt Blanche, you always said: "If you've a stallion eating oats outta your hand, best close the gate before you give him the sugar".
You said that, Blanche?
I won't go if you don't want me to, but I do want to go, so can I?
Would your mother let you go?
No.
Then go.
Thank you.
You're the best.
I'll see y'all later.
Oh, isn't she something?
I'm really proud of her.
Now, if I could just manage to rope myself a doctor that easily.
Honey, I don't think there's enough sugar left in the bowl.
Angela, that was the best meal I've ever had in my life.
Well, how good could it have been?
You left half of it.
I ate every bite.
Well, there's some sauce left.
If you really liked it, you'd take a hunk of that bread and sop it all up.
You can afford it.
Oh, no, I can't.
I've put on a few pounds.
You just haven't noticed.
What am I?
Blind?
I can see that.
I meant the bread.
You can afford the bread.
It's only 89 cents a loaf.
Angela, why don't you sit down?
I'll serve dessert.
Gosh, you two made such a fantastic meal, I can't imagine what you came up with for dessert.
I made dessert.
Damn!
What'd you say, Blanche?
Yum.
I said yum.
Rose, is this another one of those Scandinavian Viking concoctions?
Yes.
It's called genurkenflurken cake.
It's an ancient recipe, but I Americanized it.
So one might say you brought geflurkenurken into the '80s?
Yes, but I'm not one to blow my own vertubenflugen.
I can't even reach mine.
So, Sophia, have you all had a chance to catch up on old times?
Yeah, Angela filled me in on how all my friends and family back home are doing.
How is everybody, Angela?
Dead.
Angela and I are the only two left of the original family.
That's terrible, Angela.
Does that mean you're all alone back in Sicily?
Oh, no.
I have a goat.
It's really a shame you and Ma don't live closer to each other.
Dorothy is right.
How many years do we have left?
in the same town.
You wanna come back to that little village in Sicily?
Please, do I look like a woman who beats her laundry on a rock?
I meant you should move here to Miami.
Oh, that's a great idea.
Angela, you would love Miami.
Aunt Angela, what do you say?
Oh, I don't know.
I'm too old to pick up and move to a strange country.
What are you talking about?
Before your husband died, you lived here for 30 years.
I don't know.
Oh, come on, honey.
Now, just think about it.
Who would you rather live with?
Your sister or a goat?
Give me a minute.
Cousin Rose?
Cousin Sven!
Oh!
Oh, let me look at you!
Boy, have you grown!
We've never met.
But admit it, you have grown.
Uh, Rose, could you introduce Blanche and me?
Of course.
Dorothy, this is Blanche.
Blanche, this is Dorothy.
We have jokes like that around here all the time.
It's like living in a house full of Howie Mandels.
Sven, I'm Dorothy.
Hello.
And I'm Blanche.
Welcome.
Thank you.
Rose tells us you're getting married.
Yes, and I hope I'm good at it.
I don't have that much experience with women.
A big, strong, handsome thing like you?
Get out of here.
Well, it was nice meeting all of you.
No!
That was an expression, Sven.
You know, I never thought I'd say this, but I think Rose got the brains in that family.
Listen, let's make a pact.
If we decide to keep this house, we're gonna limit the number of relatives that get to come to visit.
I wonder who that could be.
I'm sure it's no one.
Hi, it's me, Stan.
See?
What did I tell you?
Stanley, what do you want?
I need to borrow a car.
No.
Doesn't anybody want to know why I need to borrow a car?
No.
Fine, fine.
I know when I'm not wanted.
Is anybody eating that?
All right, Stanley.
Why do you want to borrow the car?
Ah!
I am involved in a new business venture.
Stan's Pizzas.
The gimmick is I can deliver a pizza faster to your house than Domino's.
There's only one problem.
What?
It's impossible.
I cracked up my car trying.
So the reason you want to use our car is so you can deliver pizzas?
No.
Actually, what I would really like for you girls to do is be my drivers.
I belong in the front office - supervising, franchising, teasing the high-school girls that work for me.
I sense I may have just lost you.
Ah, what the hell.
I'm out of the pizza business.
Is there anything else to eat?
Stanley, why do you always end up here when you have a problem?
You're my best friends.
But we don't like you.
I know, but you're still my best friends.
Well, you can't depend on coming around here forever.
Blanche is thinking about selling the house.
Selling our house?
You can't be serious.
We've had great times here.
We have had great times here.
You've just had free food.
That is not true.
We've had a million laughs under this roof.
Do you Do you remember the time I came over?
Dorothy, I know it's been a while, but try to control yourself.
I need some rest.
What the hell is that for?
You're not getting into this bed, Stanley.
Then where am I supposed to sleep?
On the floor, like any dog.
Fine.
Just fine.
Stan Zbornak doesn't have to beg a woman to get into bed.
Women come to me.
Yeah, right after they get the approval number on your MasterCard.
Good night.
Oh, shut up.
Stanley, if you're doing what I think you're doing, you're in big trouble.
I was just remembering the first time you ever kicked me out of bed and I had to sleep on the floor.
Emile Zundt's Hidden Honeymoon Hideaway in the Poconos.
"Where every cottage is April in Paris".
And every bathroom, Calcutta in July.
Do you remember how I convinced you to let me back into bed?
No.
I've got a crush on you Sweetie pie All the day and nighttime Hear me sigh Oh, Stanley Zbornak, I don't believe that you're trying to charm me.
Is it working?
I don't think so.
Then you leave me no choice.
I'll have to pull out the big gun.
You're wasting your time, Stanley.
I'm familiar with the big gun.
Here goes.
Embrace me My sweet, embraceable you Embrace me You irreplaceable you Dorothy!
Dorothy, I just had a terrible nightmare.
Ma, what was it?
This.
Break it up.
Stanley, think of me as the Berlin Wall.
Try to climb over me, and you'll know what barbed wire between your legs feels like.
Gotcha.
Dorothy, how did this start?
Cole Porter?
Gershwin.
Thank God I came in time.
We've certainly had some good times, haven't we, girls?
Yes, we have, and we'd like to have more, so would you please leave, Stanley?
Girls, I've made a decision.
What is it, Blanche?
There are just too many precious memories in this house.
I'm not about to trade them in for a few lousy dollars.
It's Yakamora.
He's doubled his offer.
Tell him we'll be out by the first of the month.
Thank you for being a friend Traveled down the road and back again Your heart is true You're a pal and a confidante And if you threw a party Invited everyone you knew You would see The biggest gift would be from me And the card attached would say "Thank you for being a friend" Couldn't sleep either, Dorothy?
No, Rose.
Are you upset because Blanche is gonna sell the house and we can't live together?
No, I'm upset because Joe Piscopo didn't get the lead role in Rain Man.
Oh, of course I'm upset about the house.
Ma, it's 2am.
Where have you been?
I stuffed pillows under the sheets so I could fool you during bed check.
What is this, Stalag 17?
I went for a walk.
I couldn't sleep.
I had a nightmare.
Tell me about it, Sophia.
Sometimes I can interpret dreams.
Blanche sold the house and I wound up back at Shady Pines.
Hmm.
This is a tough one.
Dorothy, please don't send me back.
Ma, I am not sending you back to Shady Pines.
Oh, my God!
She found a cheaper home.
Blanche, please, please don't sell the house.
What the hell is that holding up your stockings?
Get out of there.
Girls, listen.
I know I told Mr. Yakamora that I'd sell him the house, but I just don't think it's fair to make that decision by myself now.
Give me some advice.
Just tell me what to do.
Well, it's your house, Blanche.
You have to make your own decision.
Since when have you all been so shy?
We always tell each other what to do.
Honey, are you all right?
I'll be fine.
Is this about Arnie?
No, Blanche.
She's upset because they keep changing the taste of Coke.
Arnie wants me to go away with him on a cruise to the Bahamas.
Oh.
Oh, and you're upset because he wants you to pay your own way?
I'm upset because we'll be all alone.
In the middle of the ocean.
On a ship.
In a stateroom.
With a bed.
Oh.
I don't know what to do.
I haven't been with a man in that special way since Charlie died.
Get out of here!
It's true.
Charlie was the only lover I ever had.
And my first time was on our wedding night.
Get out of here!
Oh, back off, Blanche.
Not all of us are classified by the Navy as a friendly port.
Maybe it sounds strange but, without Charlie, I thought that part of my life was over.
I never gave it a second thought.
Until now?
Then I think you should go on the cruise.
Honey, if the situation is right, you'll know it.
But I'm not sure I'm ready.
Oh, honey, I know what you're going through.
The bottom line is, if you take a chance in life, sometimes good things happen, sometimes bad things happen.
But, honey, if you don't take a chance, nothing happens.
I'm gonna take a chance.
Oh, that's wonderful!
Oh, great, Rose!
Oh, I have to look in my closet.
I don't even know what to wear for the first night on the ship.
A life jacket and a great big smile.
Gee, I wonder what Rose is doing right now.
You mean, you wonder if she's doing it right now.
No, I just wonder if maybe we didn't push her into something too fast.
What I can't understand is how in the world she managed to wait 15 years.
How long did you wait after George died?
Till the paramedics came.
Ma!
What about you, Dorothy?
Who was the first after Stan, hm?
Blanche.
Her divorce lawyer.
How did you know?
It's always the divorce lawyer.
Oh, it was a terrible time for me.
You know, I'd gone on an eating binge when Stan left and I put on quite a bit of weight.
Plus, I was not a 20-year-old.
You know, when you're 20, no matter what you do, everything stays where it's supposed to.
Now when you lean over, it looks like somebody's let the air out of your face.
What?
Honey, lean over a mirror some time and take a look at yourself.
Where's a mirror?
There's one in the tool drawer.
I think you'd better take a sedative before you look.
Don't be silly.
I look at my face all the time.
How different could it be leaning over?
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, Dorothy, why didn't you tell me about this before?
Only on your back, Blanche.
That way everything slides back and you look like you just had a face lift.
Oh, you're right.
I'm gorgeous.
I'm gonna have to meet men lying down.
I thought you did.
Of course, that way, not only does your face fall back but your chest does too.
Unfortunately, it falls back and off to the side.
Well, it's too late to do anything until morning.
We might as well get some sleep.
I can't sleep.
I'm wound up tighter than the girdle on a Baptist minister's wife at an all-you-can-eat pancake breakfast.
Wow, that's tight.
Back in St. Olaf, when I couldn't sleep, I'd get into my pajamas and have a nice glass of warm milk and slip under the covers and count cows jumping over my bed.
It'd usually work like a charm, except every once in a while there'd be a cow with a particularly low udder and it would brush across my forehead and wake me up.
I just don't know what I'm gonna do.
I'm just torn and confused.
Guess I'll have to think about it all tomorrow.
After all, tomorrow is another day.
Calm down, Scarlett.
There's no need to be so dramatic.
Please.
She can't help it.
Everyone around here acts like a ham.
There's been more bad acting, bad dancing and bad singing under this roof than a Suzanne Somers Special.
Rose!
Blanche!
Dorothy!
Go, Dorothy, go!
Gosh, I didn't realize how long Dorothy's solo is.
I sure hope the doctor says she's gonna be all right.
I won't dance.
Don't ask me.
Pay attention.
You're in for a treat.
Oh, Ma, not another act!
No, Dorothy, not just another act - the act.
I've taken a classic and reworked it Sophia style.
Thanks for the medicare For Blue Cross and Blue Shield For a hip that finally healed Remember on prescriptions Generic is a steal We thank you so much OK, what do you think?
Now, don't hold back.
I can take the criticism.
Depressing.
Awful.
Stinky.
Go to hell, all of you!
I will not have that filthy beast in my house.
It belongs in a barnyard.
This is not a farm chicken.
Count Bessie is a show-biz chicken.
Wait till you see this.
A show-biz chicken.
What does she do?
Play the piano?
She plays the piano.
You just wait till you see this.
OK, honey, come on.
It's showtime.
Yeah, come on, sweetheart.
Oh, I know.
I know.
Here we go.
OK, Count, hit it!
Isn't she incredible?
What do you say, girls?
Can she stay?
I guess so.
All right.
Oh, thank you.
Just be sure to keep her in her cage.
Oh.
Maybe I can convince the count to give us some live entertainment with dessert.
Have you any requests?
How about "Bye Bye Birdie"?
Girls!
Girls, Count Bessie is missing.
I went out to the garage to feed her and her cage was empty.
Where could she be?
Aunt Angela Where did you get this chicken?
The garage.
I guess this means no live entertainment with dessert.
Oh, hello, there.
How'd you do?
We came in second.
Oh, that's terrific.
What'd you get?
Treated badly.
They told us to get out of the way when they took the winner's picture with Anita Bryant.
Oh, what do those old judges know?
I'd love to hear your song.
Oh, forget it, Blanche.
Please.
Oh, no.
The whole experience was too painful.
Please.
We want to put it out of our minds.
Please.
Hit it, Rose.
I have to say what I feel Miami has so much appeal A great place to get a seafood meal Miami Miami, Miami You've got style Blue skies, sunshine, white sand by the mile When you live in this town Each day is sublime The coldest of winters Are warm and divine Miami, Miami You've got style Blue skies, sunshine, white sand by the mile Hit it!
There's ball clubs and nightclubs All within reach Dance the samba till morning Then lie on the beach Each view is a postcard Each day a great time Going home!
The cream of the crop, it's the top of the line Miami, Miami You've got style Blue skies, sunshine, white sand by the mile Miami You've got style Look, you're all confused and upset about this house business.
There's only one thing you can do.
What is that, Sophia?
Take the advice of a wise old Sicilian.
You, Sophia?
No.
Charlie Callas.
Many years ago, my father had a similar problem when he was selling real estate.
I didn't know that Grandpa ever owned any real estate.
He didn't.
That was the problem.
You see, it turned out he really didn't own the Vatican.
Although he did have a very close friend who swore he was there the night Pop won the deed in a card game from Pope Ronnie the Magnificent.
Sophia, you're not making any sense.
Excuse me, Mrs. Kierkegaard, it's 4am.
Ma, is there a point to this?
And if there wasn't, what are you gonna do?
Put decorative bars on my window?
Yes, there is a point.
If you're gonna sell real estate, make sure you own it.
Sophia, I do own this house.
Oh.
Is anybody else hungry?
Now that you mention it, I could really go for a pizza.
I've been thinking about Chinese.
I could go for a burger and fries.
Why don't we order it all?
Oh, Sophia, that'd be crazy.
So, this would be the first time we did something a little out of the ordinary around here?
Ma, thank God you're here.
Arrested for prostitution.
I can't believe it.
Sophia, we're innocent.
I know that.
I can't believe these dumb cops would think anyone would pay money to sleep with you.
Sophia, did you come to bail us out?
No, Rose, she's dropping off a manicotti with a file in it.
Well, girls, we're gonna get to see Mr. Burt Reynolds after all.
I thought these beautiful tickets were all gonna go to waste.
So which one of you isn't going?
Well, I'm the one who won the tickets.
Yeah, well, my mom's the one who's bailing us out.
I lost Butter Queen.
Haven't I suffered enough?
We'll draw straws.
No.
We'll flip a coin.
No!
Sophia, we had this all settled.
Now, try and be understanding.
Understanding?
I came down here to bail you out and you're still not letting me go?
Ma, will you stop complaining and get us out of here?
Where are your roommates, Mrs. Petrillo?
They're not here.
Ma!
Don't "Ma" me, you cheap floozie.
Ma, Ma, you would do this to your own flesh and blood?
You'll get over it, Dorothy.
And if you don't, who cares?
I'm on my way to see Burt Reynolds.
And then - you're gonna love this - Dom DeLuise takes me by the arm and insists I tell Burt the story.
Sophia, I don't want to hear any more about it.
Not even the part when Burt and Dom insisted I repeat the story to Loni Anderson?
That's it.
I don't want to hear another word.
Oh, Cinderella's back from the ball and her three wicked roommates are jealous.
We are not jealous, Ma.
We are angry.
You left us sitting in jail.
Hey, I sent over the bail money.
You were out an hour later.
I think that was just about the time I was nibbling a giant shrimp out of Jerry Reed's hand.
You're making this whole thing up just to rub it in.
You have never met these people.
Jealousy is a very ugly thing, Dorothy.
And so are you in anything backless.
Hello.
Is Sophia around?
Oh, hi, Burt.
How about a little lunch?
Listen, if you're buying, how about a big lunch?
Great.
My God, you're Mr. Burt Reynolds.
I hope so, otherwise I got the wrong underwear on.
These the roommates you told me about?
Yeah.
Which one's the slut?
I am.
Rose, it is not here!
Look again.
It has to be.
Rose, I have read every want ad in the paper.
Mine is not here.
Are you sure you dropped it off at the newspaper office?
Dorothy, you told me exactly what you wanted me to do a dozen times.
Any idiot could have done it.
I know, honey, but you were the only one going downtown.
Are you sure that you dropped it off at the newspaper office?
Yes!
Six people already called while you were out.
Give that to me.
I'll try and find it for you.
Dorothy?
Have we met?
Not yet.
I'm here because of your ad in the paper: "Willing to do anything, $8 an hour, no job too big or small".
Yes, yes, of course.
Please come in.
I'm sorry.
I didn't expect people to actually come here.
I just figured, you know, that I would be going to them.
That's the way it'll work in the future, when my video camera gets back from the shop.
So tell me, what type of work is it that you need done, Mr Toto.
Mr. Toto.
Oh, no "Mr." Just "Toto".
You're Dorothy, and I'm Toto.
At least for the next $8.
Dorothy, you owe me an apology.
Your ad's right here.
Oh, Rose, this is the personals column.
So what?
So what?
You put an ad in the personals column that said I will do anything for $8 an hour?
Oh, look, it's right under an ad that reads: "History professor seeking nonsmoking Oriental woman who is into Wesson oil and bears a resemblance to Florence Henderson".
Is that signed "Doug"?
Yes.
I know him.
He's a sick man.
I'm terribly sorry for this mix-up.
Goodbye.
Oh, my God, I don't believe this!
I'm gonna call the cops if you don't get out of here right away, you pervert!
Hi, Father Rossi.
Here's the canned goods for the needy.
Oh, no.
Oh, I'm I'm terribly sorry.
I promise that I will say Hail Marys until Madonna has a hit movie.
Hi.
Here's my $8.
Let's get started, Dorothy.
Oh, I'm not Dorothy.
She is.
I'll give you $4.
Let's get started.
How would you like your rear end kicked across the street?
Oh, great.
Here's the other $4.
Girls.
Girls, there is a busload of Greek sailors out front.
They wanna know how many drachma there are in $8.
Girls, guess what I found.
Fernando!
That's not Fernando.
What do you mean, that's not Fernando?
How could you tell?
All you have to do is look in his eyes.
Or at the price tag stuck to his back.
Oops!
Thanks for trying, Blanche.
It's nice to know I have a friend like you who cares.
Dorothy, I have a confession to make.
Rose didn't lose Fernando.
I gave him to Daisy when she was helping out with the rummage sale.
Well, then there's no problem, honey.
Just call Daisy and get Fernando back.
She's a very sweet kid.
She'll understand.
I tried that.
She said no.
What do you mean?
She's not a sweet kid anymore.
She's holding Fernando for ransom.
Come on!
Dorothy, she sent me one of his ears.
You!
Good morning.
Well, kid, what do you want?
I changed my mind.
I was wrong to ask for all those gifts.
Dorothy, you see?
I knew she'd come to her senses.
I decided cash is better.
That way I can buy exactly what I want.
I'll get my purse.
No.
Blanche, I'm not gonna let you do that.
I've been doing a lot of thinking.
If, after all the years of love and companionship, Fernando and I are meant to part company, I'll just have to accept that.
Time to time, life deals you an unfriendly hand.
There's nothing you can do about it.
I guess there's a lesson to be learned here.
Sometimes life just isn't fair, kiddo.
I cannot talk about this anymore.
I'm just gonna call Yakamora and give him my decision.
Go ahead.
Make your call.
We'll give you some privacy.
We'll go in the other room.
Come on, Ma.
Let's go.
What do you think she's gonna do?
I think she's gonna sell.
It's just too much money.
Oh, no.
Blanche is too sentimental.
I think she's gonna stay.
What do you think, Ma?
Ma!
Quiet.
Oh, this is just the operator.
Your phone is working fine.
Ma, what did you hear?
You're never gonna believe what happened.
You are never gonna believe what happened.
Yakamora decided not to buy the house.
What happened?
Well, he went on a shopping spree and he spent all his money.
He bought a department store in Fort Lauderdale and a condominium in Orlando, a baseball team in Tampa, and I think one of the Landers sisters.
But what were you gonna tell him?
What if he hadn't backed out?
What difference does that make now?
The important thing is we're staying together.
You were gonna sell, weren't you?
Damn straight.
But I was not gonna let it break us up.
We are staying together.
I don't care what happens.
We are family.
We are a team.
Come on, everybody, group hug.
