{START OF EPISODE 1}
Michelle, go to sleep.
You have a big day tomorrow.
This is not working.
I know someone who can't sleep thinking about her first day of kindergarten.
So do I. How about if I sing you a nice, soft, soothing lullaby?
Michelle's getting sleepy Oh, no, she's not She's excited about kindergarten Because she gets milk In a little carton When I need to sleep I get milk and cookies She's got the can't sleep School's starting Too excited about kindergarten Need some milk and cookie blues Oh, yeah That chick knocks me out.
Yeah.
Hey, everybody, I'm home!
Hey, I'm-- Hey, Comet, it's your Uncle J. Please, don't get up.
Hey, wake up.
Wake up!
Hey, everyone, wake up.
I'm home!
- Hey, girls.
I missed you.
- Hi.
Hey, Joseph.
Hey, Michelle.
- Hey.
- Hey.
It's 3 a.m. School starts tomorrow.
You're making lunches.
Welcome back.
That's it?
I've been on tour all summer and that's all I get?
Next time, come home earlier.
Becky!
Beck, I'm home.
Wake up.
Beck, wake up.
- Jess, you're home.
Hi, honey.
- Hey.
It's so good holding you in my arm-- Have mercy.
I know, I look like Frosty the Snowman.
It's just that two weeks ago when I saw you, you looked pregnant.
But now you look enormous.
Enormously pregnant.
I know, it was amazing.
I mean, one morning I woke up, looked down and my feet were gone.
Hey, how you doing, little baby?
Daddy's home.
It kicked.
What's it doing up so late?
You have to read this book.
It tells you everything you need to know - about having a baby.
- All right.
Chapter one.
I think we already covered that chapter.
I'm out of here, Dad.
Oh, wait a minute.
Come here.
It's my big girl's first day of high school.
- Come sit on my lap.
- Dad.
It seems like only yesterday I was holding you in my arms and I saw my reflection in your little bald head.
Dad, I have to go.
How do I look?
Cute.
Cute?
You're supposed to say I look way too hot and can't leave the house dressed like this.
I'm sorry, honey.
You look very sexy.
Hola, Deej.
Big Dan.
Hi, Kimmy.
Wow, you look nice today.
Thanks.
My dad said the same thing.
You see, Deej, you don't always have to dress hot to attract attention.
People are gonna like you for who you are on the inside, not how you look on the outside.
I know it might seem weird for me to say this but I think right now you can actually learn a lesson from Kimmy.
Ready, Deej?
I have to go back upstairs and change.
Dad wants me to be more like you.
No, no, no.
You just go to school.
Please, make new friends.
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye.
All right, right this way.
Bring it on down.
Swing that back end around.
Swing it around.
Right there.
I'm an expectant mother, not a jumbo jet.
Please, the baby can pick up your sarcasm.
- What are you talking about?
- I've been up reading that book and it says that the baby can sense everything that's going on.
So starting right now, I want happy voices and soothing sounds.
Don't you think you're going overboard with this?
Oh, is that what you think?
Hey look, pal, I'm gonna be a father, okay?
- Do you know what a big job that is?
- Oh, gosh, no, Jess, tell me.
That means I'm gonna be responsible for another human life, okay?
And I want it to start out right.
So for now on, carry this around.
Jess, I am not going to listen to Elvis 24 hours a day.
I figured that, so.
I bet its little lip's curling up right now.
My God, it heard me call it "it".
We have to find out if it's a boy or girl.
Now, Jess, you promised that we'd be surprised.
Happy sounds, soothing voices.
No.
Now, Jess, you agreed that we'd be surprised.
But I want you to change your mind.
- It's not gonna happen.
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.
Don't you worry, your parents aren't always this kooky.
- I'm not changing my mind.
- Yes, you are.
Hey, girls.
Ready for your first day of school?
Are you kidding?
This year, I'm getting a man teacher and he is a major babe.
Oh.
Fourth grade is gonna be so awesome.
Hey, I look good, I feel good, and I'm wearing a smile that says: "Stephanie Tanner, you're a winner".
How about you?
Are you ready, Michelle?
Not as ready as she is.
Are the other kids gonna like me?
Oh, of course they're gonna like you.
But to be sure, you should do what I did my first day of school.
See, when all the kids asked me my name, I just went: "Hello, my name is Joey Gladstone".
And all the kids laughed and we became friends.
Okay, you try it.
Hello, my name is Joey Gladstone.
That's good, but next time try using your own name.
Hello, my name is Michelle Tanner.
Hello, my name is Michelle Tanner.
Well, girls, here we are.
This is my school?
It's so big!
Well, you're a big girl now, Michelle.
I'm not that big.
Michelle, you're gonna be fine.
But if you need any help your big sister's right in the same school.
- Right, Steph?
- Don't worry, Michelle.
Kindergarten is just like preschool, only without the naps.
Too bad.
I'm good at naps.
Come on, everybody.
Are you coming, Michelle?
I don't know about this.
- Come on.
Let's go.
- Come on.
Jason.
Here's your classroom, Michelle.
Doesn't this look like the happiest place on Earth?
No, that's Disneyland.
- Hello, I'm Miss Wiltrout.
- Hi, I'm Danny Tanner, and this is Joey.
Mr. Tanner.
How do you do, Joey?
- And what's your name?
- Michelle Elizabeth Tanner.
This is my first day at school.
That's okay, it's everybody's first day.
Oh, excuse me.
Please don't climb on my desk there.
Michelle, you have a great first day of school.
I know you're gonna love it.
You'll have fun, honey.
I hope you're right.
And, Michelle remember what I told you about making new friends.
- Bye, honey.
- Bye, Michelle.
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.
- Who are you?
- My name is Michelle Tanner.
You are a strange kid.
They hate me already.
I'm out of here.
Oh, this is our first one.
I'm so happy.
Excuse me, excuse me.
Have you seen my sister Stephanie Tanner?
I don't know about this.
All right.
Let me help you down here.
We'll just sit.
Now, remember, we don't wanna know if it's a boy or a girl, okay?
- Okay.
All right, yes, I understand.
- This is an interesting sonogram.
- Boy-- - It's a boy!
We'll name him Jesse Junior.
How's his hair?
Does he need mousse?
I'm not saying it's a boy.
Oh, then it's a girl.
Jessica Junior.
- She's not dating until she's 35.
- I didn't say it was a girl.
What's left?
All we wanna know is if the baby is healthy.
Relax.
You don't smoke and you don't drink.
You're doing everything just right.
The babies will be just fine.
See that, Jess?
The babies will be just fine.
Now, let's go.
Did you say babies?
Did she say babies?
That's what I said.
You're having twins.
Who's having twins?
You are.
Congratulations.
Jess, we're having twins!
Oh, honey.
Twins I just wanted to know if it was a boy or a girl.
Twins.
We're having twins.
That's two babies at one time.
The first baby comes out, then the second baby.
Then we take them home and raise them?
That's generally how it works.
Here's your sonogram.
Oh, Jess, this is so exciting.
Our first baby pictures.
See, here's one little head and there's the other.
Sometimes one hides behind the other.
Oh, honey, that's so cute.
They're already playing together.
Any more hiding back there?
No.
Oh, this is so exciting.
I've gotta get down to work and tell everyone.
Okay.
I'm gonna stay and ask a few questions.
- Okay.
We'll celebrate tonight.
- All right.
Honey, we're having twins!
Jesse, are you all right?
Oh, no.
Oh, I'm fine.
No, I'm great.
It's an extra baby, so I'm extra happy.
You know, before I was just responsible for one human life.
Heck, now I'm responsible for two human lives.
I'm fine.
Really.
I mean, I'm so-- Can I just lay down real fast for a second?
Could you just click the oxygen on as fast as you can?
One of the most exciting things about fourth grade is that we'll be using computers.
Has anyone ever used one?
I've used my sister D.J.'s computer.
She used up the last of the cream rinse in the shower this morning.
That's why my hair doesn't have as much body and bounce as it usually does.
I guess I'll sit down now.
I'm really not a geek.
No one said you were.
All right, another thing we'll be doing is breaking the class into discovery groups.
And here's our first discovery.
Psst.
It's me, Michelle.
I know who you are.
Stephanie, would you like to introduce us to your guest?
Not really.
I'm her sister Michelle.
Hi, I'm Mr. Lowry.
You were right.
He is a major babe.
Why aren't you in kindergarten?
Nobody likes me there.
I wanna stay with you.
What a sense of humor.
Can I take her back to kindergarten?
- Of course you can.
- Thanks.
But try not to teach anything until I get back.
I don't wanna go back.
Don't worry, Michelle.
Your big sister's on the job.
Now, there's no reason why any of those kindergarten kids shouldn't like you.
I mean, you're a terrific little person.
Don't tell me.
Tell them.
Look what I found.
There you are, Michelle.
What happened?
That boy said I was strange.
She talks with her hands on her head.
I think I can help here.
May I?
Oh, be my guest.
Michelle was just trying to show you kids the cool new way to say hello.
The Bullwinkle way.
Okay, antlers up.
Now, repeat after me.
Good morning, Michelle.
Good morning, Michelle.
Good morning to you.
Wasn't that fun?
Let's all thank Michelle for showing us how to be a little bit cooler.
See, Michelle?
They like you.
Well, my work here is done.
Good job.
- Stephanie.
- Yes, Michelle?
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.
Good boy, Comet.
You cleaned your plate.
Now, remember what I taught you.
Attaboy, Comet.
Good dog.
Yes.
You know, Joey, you can learn something from that dog.
- Oh, hey, guys.
- Hey, Jess congratulations, man, you're having twins.
Way to go, buddy boy.
When you do something, you really do it, huh?
- Where have you been all day?
- I was at the doctor's office.
Your appointment was three hours ago.
I forgot I had a car.
Plus, my head is just kind of jammed.
I mean I-- I mean, you know, having a baby is great but having twins.
Twins are gonna be twice as great.
Twice the love, twice the hugs, twice the kisses.
It's not that simple, Jesse boy.
Twins are twice the feeding, twice the crying, twice the diapers and twice the responsibility.
- Who are you?
- I'm your evil twin, Manny Tanner.
You need a shower, Manny.
Jess, twins will mean twice as many "I love you, Daddys".
You live in a bubble, you Lysol-loving hug freak.
I'm cracking up here.
Come on, Jess.
You're gonna make a great father.
What do you know?
You're 33 years old and you wear Scooby-Doo pajamas.
Just the bottoms.
And I suppose you're my evil twin.
Yeah, what was your first clue, Sherlock?
Well, you look a lot like me.
Hey, Jess, you can kiss your rock 'n' roll days goodbye.
You won't look cool with a twin on each arm and a spit-up rag on each shoulder.
You know, for an evil twin, you're not very nice.
Oh, good comeback.
- Yeah, it's very funny.
- You know, I'm really sick of you.
You really make me nauseous.
Good comeback.
Would the four of you guys just stop!
Oh, thank God, it's just the two of you.
Guys.
You know, Jess, you've been up all night.
- I think you just need to get some sleep.
- No, I don't need any sleep.
Maybe a little nap wouldn't hurt.
Hi, Uncle Jesse, wanna play?
Not right now, shorty.
I got a lot of stuff going on in my mind.
Thanks.
Not so fast, mister.
Park it right here.
Michelle, I really don't wanna talk right now.
You always talk to me.
I guess you're right.
I've been spilling my guts to you since before you were able to talk back, huh?
Spill those guts.
Well, you heard about this twins thing, right?
Yes, I did.
I'm very proud of you.
Thank you, but.
I don't know, I guess I'm just apprehensive.
Appre-- What?
Apprehensive.
It means-- It means that I'm nervous about twins.
This has got to be our little secret, okay?
Because I'm afraid to talk to the family about it.
You know, they think of me as being so together and in control all the time.
I just don't want them to see me like this.
I don't know what to do.
- I do.
- You do?
Stephanie!
- What are you doing, Michelle?
- Stephanie helped me at school.
She's a genius.
- What's wrong, Michelle?
- Nothing.
Nothing's wrong.
Uncle Jesse's apprehensive.
That means nervous.
I'm fine, Steph.
I'm fine.
All right.
No offense, but I think you're just a little young for this problem.
Okay, in that case D.J.!
- What is it?
- Uncle Jesse's apprehensive.
No, I'm not apprehensive.
I'm fine.
Okay, girls, now, this is an adult thing.
No problem.
Dad, Joey, Aunt Becky!
Uncle Jesse's apprehensive.
- Jesse's apprehensive.
- I'm fine.
Everybody, I'm fine.
Okay, I'm fine.
I'm just having a bad hair day, that's all.
I'm a little apprehensive about my pH balance.
You said you were apprehensive about the twins.
Here's another new word for you: Blabbermouth.
I know that one.
Jess, I thought you were happy about the twins.
I am.
I'm extremely happy.
I'm happy.
I'm thrilled.
I'm lying.
Becky, I'm scared to death.
Uncle Jesse, you're never scared.
Yeah, well, I've never been a father before.
You know, having one kid is scary enough but the thought of having two?
You're the greatest uncle in the world.
Yeah, but being an uncle is easy.
I listen to your problem, throw in my two cents and then I dump the final decision on your dad.
But now, I'm gonna be totally responsible.
My babies' lives are gonna be in my hands.
I make one wrong decision and I screw up two lives.
I'm sorry, Becky you must think I'm a jerk.
No, honey.
I'm just as scared as you.
Oh, great.
Who's gonna take care of our kids?
You know, what you guys are going through is perfectly normal.
I was a nervous wreck the first time I became a parent.
Once you hold that little baby in your arms I'm telling you, you can't believe the feeling.
Come on, you two are gonna make great parents.
And just remember, we'll be here whenever you need us.
Jess, for the past four years you've been living in this house and you've been Uncle Jesse.
But now, I'm gonna get to be Uncle Danny.
Your kids are gonna be so clean.
I'll babysit my new cousins anytime, except for Friday and Saturday nights.
And I'll take Friday and Saturday, until I start dating.
I'll help too, but no diapers.
They make me apprehensive.
I tell you, guys, I'm still a little scared but knowing that I got you guys to back me up really makes me feel happy.
Well, honey, I am sure we're gonna make our share of mistakes but one thing is for sure.
No two kids are gonna be loved more.
You count on that.
Oh, you guys gotta see our first baby picture.
Aren't they cute?
They'll look a lot better once they get eyebrows.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
D.J., D.J., D.J., wake up.
It's Saturday morning.
I'm sleeping.
Then why are you talking?
I'm talking in my sleep.
Good night.
You're missing Road Runner cartoon.
Hey, Looney Tune.
Hey, cut the mneeping.
When you reach a certain age, you're just too mature to waste your Saturday mornings watching cartoons.
Michelle, quick.
You're missing the Road Runner.
Wile E. Coyote just ran off a cliff and he's standing in midair.
Come on, let's go, because as soon as he looks down you know it's gonna be:  How come he doesn't fall until he looks down?
That's how cartoon gravity works.
Now, come on, let's go.
Oh, well, I'm up.
Hey, Michelle, look who came over to play.
- Hi, Teddy.
- Hi, Michelle.
So, what are you two crazy kids up to, a little tea party?
We're gonna play Terminator 2.
: Oh, no problemo.
Hasta la vista, baby.
Consider that a divorce.
I'm the party pooper.
I'll be back.
Let's play house.
Okay, I'll be the daddy.
I'll be Uncle Jesse.
Uncle Jesse?
You should be the mommy.
I don't know how to be the mommy.
- Why not?
- I don't have a mommy.
You should get one.
Mommies use fabric softener on your pajamas.
My daddy does that.
Mommies always have good candy in their purse.
My daddy has Wet-Naps in his wallet.
Mommies smell nice and wear pretty dresses.
You got me there.
It's too bad you don't have a mommy.
You're missing something good.
Yeah, you're right.
I need a mommy.
Dad, just to save you some more cleaning what's the capital of Ecuador?
Steph, wouldn't it be better if you looked it up instead of me telling you?
You don't know, do you?
Not a clue.
Dad, I have to write a paper about what it's like being another person.
So, guess what.
I'm gonna live in someone else's house for two days and someone else is gonna live here.
That sounds like a neat idea.
So who's gonna live here?
Hola, Mr. T. Dad, do something.
She's got luggage.
God save us all.
Dad, it's for school.
Every good grade helps me get into college.
You know, a good education is highly overrated.
Just relax.
You guys are gonna have a great time because Kimmy's not really Kimmy.
Kimmy's gonna be me.
And I'm not gonna be me anymore because I'm gonna be Kimmy.
Am I going too fast, Mr. T?
I want my little girl back.
Don't look at me.
She's right here.
Okay, look.
I suppose we can give this a try as long as you can behave like D.J. Well, there are a few slight differences.
I don't do housework, homework, or anything else with "work" in it.
Well, enjoy the new me.
AdiÃ³s, Tanneritos.
- Bye.
Bye.
So, what do we do now?
You people like to hug, don't you?
- Hey, guys.
Hey, Jess.
Hi.
- Can you believe it?
Jesse and the Rippers got turned down by another record company.
They said our image is too soft.
Where do those jerks get off calling me soft?
I'm as tough as anybody.
Oh, hello in there.
How are my little twinsie-winsies?
Did I just say "twinsie-winsies"?
Yessie-wessie, Jesse.
They're right.
I'm a wuss.
Beck, what am I gonna do?
I have a big showcase tomorrow night for another record company.
Well, you and Joey used to be in advertising.
Why don't you get the old team back together and come up with a bad image.
What's this bonehead know about being bad?
He watches cartoons all day.
Are you trying to tell me that the Tasmanian Devil isn't bad?
- What does he do?
- It just so happens he spins around and slobbers.
You're an idiot, but I'm desperate.
- Let's go.
- Idiot?
Bye, Becky.
Aunt Becky, can we talk?
Sure, sweetheart.
What do you wanna talk about?
How do I get a mommy?
Um, well, first your daddy needs to fall in love with a nice lady.
How do you fall in love?
Well, I fell in love with your Uncle Jesse over a candlelight dinner with flowers and soft music.
Oh, it was very romantic.
Was there kissing?
Yes, there was.
Ooh.
Oh, it was just a little good-night kiss that lasted three hours.
How come nobody kisses my daddy?
Well, that's a good question.
I don't know.
I mean, your daddy's a great guy.
Okay, so he spends all his time cleaning and he talks too much, especially about himself.
All your daddy needs to do is find a nice lady who's a good listener, and who needs a housekeeper.
Now, I'm sure that she's out there somewhere.
And when he finds her, he'll fall in love, and then you'll have a new mommy.
Do you understand?
Yes, I do.
My daddy needs help.
What it's like to be D.J. Tanner.
Day one.
I'm about to discover the joy of having a little sister.
Hey, squirt, get me two doughnuts, pronto.
In your dreams.
Don't you get it, kid?
I'm the big sister.
I gave you a direct order, now snap to it.
Excuse me, Comet.
Gibbler, let me tell you how this sister thing works.
You're a pain in my neck, and I'm a pain in yours.
It's a jungle in here.
So if you want a doughnut, you march your little bird legs down to the kitchen and get it yourself.
Go ahead, I'll time you.
Ready.
Go.
Go.
You're losing time.
Comet, there goes one human you're smarter than.
Jess, it's macho, it's tough.
It's that hard-edge rock 'n' roll image we've been looking for.
I love it.
I hate it.
- Come on, Jess.
It's totally Nelson.
- Ah!
I look like Cousin Itt.
Joey, think more on the lines of, like, Whitesnake and Ratt and Poison.
Groups like that.
I need something to grab the audience by their throat and just rip it apart.
Okay, hold on.
I'm getting something.
What are those birds that swoop down that everyone's afraid of?
Pigeons?
No.
Bigger, darker, scarier.
I got it.
You are Vulture.
- Vulture, I like it.
- Yeah?
It's dark.
It's vicious.
It's kind of like a buzzard, but it's got better hair.
Yeah.
Ladies and gentlemen, cover your heads.
Hide your dead and bandage your open wounds.
- Yeah.
- Here comes Vulture.
Come on, do it.
Do it.
Vulture.
Scarier.
Darker.
More tongue.
More tongue.
All right, now, children it's time to put away your crayons and clean up your desks.
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
- Oh, yes, Michelle.
- I got crayon on my desk.
Oh, that's all right.
A little cleanser will clean that right up.
Do you like to clean?
Oh, yes.
I always say a clean room is a happy room.
My daddy says that too.
All right, another day without an injury.
Oh, hi.
Brandon T. and Brandon L., here are your moms.
Oh, and there's Michelle's dad.
Hi, Michelle.
Daddy, guess what.
Guess what.
Guess what.
What?
What?
What?
Miss Wiltrout said a clean room is a happy room.
Sounds like my kind of teacher.
That is very good news.
- Hello, Mr. Tanner.
- Nice to see you again.
I'll let you two talk.
So how's Michelle doing?
Well, she did very well in art class today.
Unfortunately, most of it wound up on her desk.
Hmm.
Well, do you mind if I take this whole thing home and hang it on the refrigerator?
I got a secret.
What?
Tell me.
My daddy and Miss Wiltrout are gonna fall in love.
They are not.
They are too.
I'm getting a new mommy.
Our teacher's gonna be your new mommy?
Watch this.
You know, if you buff these desks with a cheesecloth I think it will bring out the natural luster of the Formica for you.
- I'll make a note of that.
- Right.
Daddy, can Miss Wiltrout eat at our house?
Well, sure, I guess if Miss Wiltrout's looking for someplace to eat we'd love to have her over.
How about lunch tomorrow?
Well, lunch sounds lovely.
Perfect.
It's a date then.
Yes.
Hey, little sis, you know what I learned from trading places with D.J.?
There's no one I'd rather be than me.
Except maybe Madonna, because she's really rich.
Or maybe Julia Roberts.
People say I look just like her.
Kimmy, I'm in the closet.
I've closed the door.
Does that mean anything to you?
Yeah, I should talk louder.
Hey, I like your outfit.
You should, it's yours.
D.J., you're back.
What have the Gibblers done to you?
Nothing.
I'm just trying to get the total Kimmy experience.
Now, back off, squirt.
I just came back to get my skates.
You didn't tell me it was roller-derby night at your house.
It's me and your dad versus your mom and brother in the ultimate grudge match.
No holds barred, no time limit.
Watch out for my mom.
She hides an eggbeater in her pants.
Got it.
You know, Kimmy, it's kind of fun being you.
Hey, Mr. T., pretty sharp sweater.
Not.
Hey, totally stony dog collar.
All right.
Wow.
Danny, you really fit in.
That Mister Rogers sweater didn't give you away at all.
Hey, man, I know you dudes.
Wait till you guys see the special effects I rigged.
The guys from the record company are gonna be totally stoked.
Hey, bogus sweater, dude.
Oh, thanks, man.
It's machine-washable.
- All right.
- All right.
Whoa, I gotta go start the show.
Peace, hippies.
Peace, baby.
The Smash Club presents the world premiere of Vulture.
One, two.
One, two, three!
Hey, get me down.
It's stuck.
Just sing.
I'll fix it.
I wanna rock He wants to rock Joey, get me down.
Joey, get him down You're dead meat.
He's dead meat  What are you doing?
- Hold him for a second.
Just hold him.
Hey, I'm trying to play.
- Get me down!
- Be careful, sweetheart.
- Just keep singing, they love you.
What?
Keep singing, they love you.
Whoa!
One, two, three, four!
Way to go, sweetheart!
Yeah!
Thank you.
Thank you.
Rock 'n' roll, everybody.
Vulture lives.
Oh, come on, Jess, talk to me.
Vulture wasn't that bad.
And the firemen were happy to get you down.
It's their job.
Thanks to you, I got rock 'n' roll's biggest wedgie.
Okay, you don't wanna fly?
You could always burrow up from under the stage and be "The Gopher".
The Gopher.
Oh, there's a real tough image.
Hey, ask any gardener who he fears the most.
And if you remember back to the movie Caddyshack, you know : you kill those varmints and they always come back.
It's kind of a Cinderella story, you know so I got that going for me, which, you know, it's a plus.
This whole thing was just a big mistake.
I'll go back to being Jesse and the Rippers.
I'm gonna find some record company out there who wants me for me.
And if not, you can always make a living playing Peter Pan.
Ah!
- Daddy, my teacher's here.
Hurry up.
- I'm coming, Michelle.
Here.
Women love flowers.
Well, that's very sweet of you.
Wait a minute.
You look very handsome.
Well, thank you very much.
Now, be nice and don't talk about yourself.
Michelle, I do not talk about myself.
Okay, maybe I do a bit, but that's because when I was 5 I didn't really have any friends.
Daddy.
Okay, you're right.
I'll do my best.
- Well, here I am.
- Hello.
- How are you?
- Good.
Hello, Michelle.
- These are for you.
- Dandelions, my favorite.
Daddy is the nicest man in the whole world.
Well, I don't know if I'm the nicest man in the whole world.
Although some people think I might be the cleanest.
In fact, in high school, I founded the F.J.A. Future Janitors of America.
Well, enough about me.
Why don't we go eat some lunch.
Ah.
This way, please.
Oh, look at that.
Michelle set the table all by herself.
Oh, it looks very pretty.
There's no candles because I can't play with matches.
Isn't he a gentleman?
Yes.
He gets a gold star for good manners.
And she also made lunch all by herself.
What do we have here?
We have peanut butter and jelly, and milk.
Uh, sweetheart, there's only one glass of milk here.
I know.
Now you could share.
Have a nice lunch.
- Michelle, aren't you gonna eat with us?
- You need to be alone.
She sure went to a lot of trouble for this.
You know, she's really doing very well in school.
You don't need to suck up like this.
Hey, we Tanners are not suck-ups.
Goody two-shoes maybe, but not suck-ups.
Well, maybe she just wants us to be very good friends.
I guess.
Bon appÃ©tit.
Are you in love yet?
Oh, dear.
Here, here.
Arms up.
Arms way.
Have a sip of milk.
Mmm, good boy.
That's a good boy.
Thank you.
Michelle what did you just say?
I said, are you in love yet?
Michelle.
- We're just friends.
- Then you better start kissing.
Your teacher and I are not going to kiss and we're not gonna fall in love.
Now, I'll never get a new mommy.
Oh, dear.
I'm sorry.
I had no idea this was what she had in mind.
I'll talk to her.
Excuse me for a moment?
- Oh, yes.
Yes, of course.
- Thanks.
Oh.
Come in.
- Hi, Michelle.
- Hi, Daddy.
I think we have to talk.
I think we'd better.
I'm sorry you went to so much trouble today.
I wish I had a mommy.
Well, I know you don't remember but you had a wonderful mommy.
And she loved you very, very much.
It's no fair.
All the other kids have mommies.
Well, I know it might seem like everybody else has a mommy but, honey, the truth is some people just have a mommy or they just have a daddy or a grandma, or a grandpa, or an aunt and uncle.
There's all different kinds of families.
- Really?
- Yeah.
What makes a family is when you have people who take care of one another and love each other.
You have a very special family.
You have a daddy, and an Uncle Jesse and an Aunt Becky and a Joey.
I bet nobody in school has a Joey.
That's a pretty safe bet.
So you see, you and your sisters, you're pretty lucky.
Because you have four people who care about you and love you very, very much.
I love you very, very much.
I love you too.
Come on, let's go have lunch with your teacher, okay?
Will I ever get a new mommy?
- Well, I hope so.
- Have you met the school nurse?
She's very hot.
Really?
How hot is she?
What color hair does she have?
- Hot pink.
- Hot pink.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Hurry up.
I'm coming, Michelle.
That was a big one.
All right, stay cool, Michelle.
The Katsopolis cure for hiccups never, never fails.
You gotta flap your arms like a chicken and wiggle your eyes like Groucho.
This has nothing to do with a cure.
I was just trying to see if you were dopey enough to do it.
All right, now, here's the real cure.
What you do is take a sip of water.
Okay, now.
Now, now, okay.
Now what you gotta do is say the magic words: Have mercy.
Have mercy.
See that?
All right, we'll go to the cure recommended by the New England Journal of Medicine.
Ah!
That wasn't very nice.
- I'm telling Daddy.
- Come on, I'm just trying to help.
Don't get me in trouble here.
It worked, didn't it?
Dad!
Okay, chapter six.
What do we know about Jefferson?
He owns a cleaning store, and he's married to Weezie.
Don't mind Kimmy.
She has a seat reserved in summer school.
So, Rick, are you free this weekend?
I know D.J.'s free this weekend.
Very subtle, Kimmy.
Well, I don't have any plans.
Hey, they're opening a new roller coaster on Saturday night at Thrill Mountain.
The Squirminator.
Well, that's this weekend when we're both free.
Yeah, that's not obvious.
You know, I was thinking that maybe you and I could-- Hey, you must be Rick.
The Rickmeister Rickarama, the Rickshaw man, Rikki-Tikki-Tavi.
My annoying little sister was just leaving.
No, your adorable little sister was just making herself comfortable.
Uh-- Hey.
Wait a minute.
Moment, please.
Can we talk?
Just a-- How rude!
So, Rick, where were we?
You nutty teenagers are always goofing around.
As if you didn't want me in my own room.
Bye-bye.
So, Rick, we were just talking about Thrill Mountain.
Thrill Mountain?
I love Thrill Mountain.
Deej, remember the time you threw up on the Wild Weasel?
- No.
- How could you forget?
You were pigging out on corn dogs and they had to stop the ride for 30 minutes to hose it down.
Well, sounds like you're not ready for the Squirminator.
I gotta go.
See you in school tomorrow.
Bye, Rickmonster.
Rickatoni, Rickory-dickory-dock.
Stephanie, you ruined everything.
Rick was just about to ask me out.
Maybe he'll ask you out tomorrow.
Oh, sure.
By tomorrow, he'll find someone who can hold her corn dogs.
They'll fall in love on the Squirminator, and I'll end up desperate and alone.
You'll never be alone.
You'll always have me.
I don't want you.
You're always in my way.
I'm getting my own room.
You, little sister, are history.
Come on.
The Deejenizer.
The Dijon mustard.
Come on, you're just.
- Hey, sweetheart.
- Hi, honey.
- How you doing?
- Mm-hm.
Good.
- How are my little twinsters doing?
- Fine.
What'd you get me?
Just what you wanted, salt-and-vinegar potato chips.
Oh, honey, is that what I asked for?
Because I really have a craving for garlic-and-cheddar chips.
Mm.
Well, I had a feeling you might change your mind.
Especially after the second time you paged me at the market.
So I got every chip-- Every chip known to man.
It's the pregnancy variety pack.
Oh, honey, you are so thoughtful.
You didn't happen to get any with ridges, did you?
What's the big deal about ridges?
It's like a potato chip that needs to be ironed.
Honey, those ridges help you scoop up a lot more bean dip.
- Oh, no, the bean dip, I forgot.
- Sweetie, you know what?
It doesn't matter.
We have to set up - for our childbirth class right now.
- Right.
You can shop for bean dip after class is over.
Oh, goody.
Whoa.
A million billion chips and nobody in the kitchen?
Oh, nuts, childproof.
- You need to move this furniture back.
- See you, guys.
Have a good time.
You guys are welcome to stay for childbirth class.
It's really interesting.
Oh, we'd love to, Becky, but darn our luck we're stuck with these two tickets to the Warriors game.
- Those are the breaks.
Let's roll, buddy.
- Okay, pal.
Hi.
Hi.
Guys, this is Lisa Green.
She teaches our childbirth class.
Hi, Lisa.
I'm Danny Tanner, your eager student.
Enjoy the game, Joey.
Hi, I'm Joey Gladstone, ex-Warriors fan.
Nice meeting you both, but in order to join our class one of you has to be pregnant.
Well, I have been retaining an awful lot of water lately.
That's funny.
Actually, I'm just taking the class in case Jesse passes out in the delivery room and Becky needs a backup coach.
And I'll be there to back up Danny when he passes out.
Well, okay.
You're welcome to stay and observe.
That's great, because I have a lot of questions about childbirth.
Like, for instance are you and your husband planning any children?
Actually, I'm single.
Well, what a coincidence.
So am I. Daffy Duck.
No, he just spits when he talks.
It's-- Be a tough choice for you.
Dad, Uncle Jesse, Joey may I please see you guys in the kitchen?
Actually, I'm kind of busy, honey.
Is it really important?
Dad, this is my biggest crisis this week.
Okay, we're coming.
Excuse us.
Pull it open, Comet.
These are doggie-proof too.
Michelle.
Honey, did you take these potato chips without asking?
I told you we would get in trouble.
Excuse me, if I may have your attention.
I would like to make a very important presentation entitled: "My Own Room: Together We Can Make It Happen".
- The first point I'd like to make is that-- - Don't listen to her!
Thank you, Stephanie, you've just illustrated my first point: "Interruptions".
I cannot talk on the phone do my homework or entertain my friends without-- That's ridiculous.
I do not-- Steph, let's hear what D.J. has to say then you'll get your chance to interrupt.
That's all I ask.
Moving on to my next point: "Two different worlds".
I go to high school, land of maturity.
Stephanie and Michelle go to elementary school.
Tiny town.
Now, they share a school, they should share a room.
I object!
I happen to be in fourth grade and have nothing in common with a kindergarten baby like Michelle.
Who are you calling a baby, baby?
Children, please.
To bring up my next point: "Strange but true facts".
Stephanie and Michelle are the exact same ages Stephanie and I were when we started sharing a room.
- Isn't that amazing?
- That is amazing.
It's like that thing where Kennedy had a secretary named Lincoln and Lincoln had a secretary named Kennedy.
What's amazing is you're able to dress yourself every morning.
In conclusion, I've paid my dues, and I deserve my own room.
If there's any justice in this world, then you'll set me free.
Gentlemen, I thank you.
Okay.
Steph, do you have a rebuttal?
No, but you should hear my side of this.
Please don't make me live with a 4-year-old baby.
I'm not a baby.
I'm 4 and three-quarters.
You're still a little shrimp.
Stop calling me names, you cheesehead.
Okay, that's enough, you two.
Just give us guys a second, and we're gonna talk this over.
- Can I see chart number two--?
- Get in here.
Okay, we've come to a decision.
Dad, that's so unfair.
You haven't even heard what I have to say.
Sorry, just a habit.
It just so happens that we agree with you.
- You do?
- You do?
Yep.
Starting this weekend, Michelle is gonna move in with Stephanie and, D.J., you get your own room.
Finally, my own room!
I have to go tell Kimmy.
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you.
Nice knowing you, kid.
Hey, guys, Lisa needs some help setting up.
- Any volunteers?
- Danny.
Honey, I'm a little chilly.
Could you get my wool socks?
All our winter stuff is up in the crawlspace.
- I'd have to crawl up there, get all dirty-- - Thank you, sweetheart.
No problem, darling.
Two more months.
Just two more months.
Well, Michelle, I guess it's just you and me.
I don't wanna live with you.
Why not?
You look up to me.
That's because I'm short.
Michelle, we're gonna be roommates.
This should be the happiest day of your life.
Read my lips: Pbbbt!
Nobody wants to live with me.
Comet, you don't know what it's like to have everyone against you.
Well, if D.J. and Michelle don't wanna live with me I'll just find a place of my own.
Thanks for the offer but it might be a little crowded in your doghouse.
Breathe in.
Breathe out.
Breathe in.
Cleansing breath.
Okay, let's all take out our focus objects.
Remember, this is what the mothers will be concentrating on during labor.
Here you go, babe.
Focus on the King.
Jess, when you give birth you focus on the King.
All right.
Better?
Much.
Our last exercise will be deep breathing with our focus objects.
Okay, try it again.
Breathe in.
Breathe out.
Okay, keep going.
- Hi there.
- Hi.
You know, if I seem a little advanced it's because I've already been through four births my three daughters and, of course, my own.
Seeing my three girls being born was the most beautiful experience of my life.
Yeah, tell me about it.
When Fred and Wilma had Pebbles, I cried for a week.
Ya-ba-da-ba--  I love those voices you do.
You know, I do a few cartoon voices myself.
Hey, stop chasing me, you mean cat.
- That was really good.
Thanks.
Who was that?
That was Tom, you know, the little mouse from Tom and Jerry.
Tom was the cat.
Jerry was the mouse.
And neither one of them ever talked.
Get a life.
Joey's right.
Jerry is a mouse that never talks.
But what is fascinating is that Mickey, he's also a mouse and he can just talk for hours on any subject.
Yeah, yeah, like Pluto, for instance.
I mean, this guy's a dog.
He wears a dog collar and lives in a doghouse.
Yet Goofy, who's also a dog drives a car, plays golf and lives in a condo.
That is exactly what I was talking about.
You know what?
You two are actually perfect for each other.
I'm sorry I tried to pick you up.
I'll be right over here.
Lis, would you like to go out for pizza sometime?
I'd love to go out with you just as soon as class is over.
- Class is over.
Snack time.
All right, here's a little snack for you.
Whoa, watch out, guys.
It's feeding time.
Mm!
Mm!
Honey, you know what I just got a craving for?
A nice slice of seedless watermelon.
- Doesn't that sound good?
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, really good.
- Watermelon's out of season right now.
I'd probably have to go to Mexico to get it.
Well, you've got a car.
Do you believe this, guys?
She'd send me to Mexico to get her seedless watermelon.
- I mean, do you believe this?
- I know.
Well, wait a minute, wait a minute.
We shouldn't have to send them.
They should be happy to go.
- Yeah.
- Right.
Yeah.
Ho-ho-hold it, baby boomers.
Now, going to the market and stuff like that, that's fine.
But leaving the country to get seedless watermelon because you have some wacky craving, that's where I draw the line.
Yeah.
Next thing you know, she's gonna want Swiss chocolate.
- Oh, that does sound good.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Swiss chocolate.
I'm not going to Switzerland.
Jess, you're missing the point.
It's not about where you go.
It's about you guys being there for us.
I mean, okay, so maybe we're a little overemotional.
And maybe we do get a little demanding.
But that's because our hormones are running wild.
I mean, we're happy, we're sad, we're hot, we're cold, we're huge!
And all we want are ridgy potato chips and a nice slice of juicy watermelon with a side of Swiss chocolate.
Now, is that too much to ask?
I don't think so!
No, sweetheart, no, no, no, I'm sorry.
It's not too much to ask.
I know the babies depend on you for everything so you should be able to depend on me, I'm sorry.
Oh, Jess, what's wrong with me?
I mean, you're so patient and understanding and I don't deserve you.
No, no, you do.
You deserve me.
She deserves me, right, guys?
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, now you wanna be my friend.
I'm gonna be normal again someday, right?
I hope so.
May I help you?
Just measuring my new room.
Kimmy was right.
There is enough room for a hot tub.
No so fast, sister.
This is still my room.
Michelle, you heard Dad.
You're moving in with Stephanie, and I'm getting this room all to myself.
You just stay in your own room.
Stephanie moved out.
- No, she didn't.
- Yes, she did.
- No, she didn't.
- Yes, she did.
- No, she didn't.
- Yes, she did.
Why am I arguing with a 4-year-old?
I'm 4 and three-quarters!
You're right.
She's gone.
Duh!
Well, where did she go?
Follow me.
Stephanie?
Did someone forget how to knock?
Stephanie, what are you doing in here?
I live here.
Isn't it cool?
I turned the sink into a wet bar, the tub into a waterbed and I'm thinking of turning the toilet into a love seat.
Hi, girls.
- Is there something you wanna tell me?
- Stephanie lives in the potty now.
Oh, really?
Well, I love what you've done with the place.
Thanks.
I've got the cable guy coming Tuesday.
Honey why did you move in here?
Because I've got no place else to go.
D.J. and Michelle don't wanna live with me.
Girls, I don't like what I'm hearing.
Maybe we should just rethink this whole idea of changing rooms.
No, no, no rethinking.
Your original thinking was perfect.
Just give me a chance to work this all out.
Okay, Deej.
Heck, you've had enough Dad talks over the years.
I think I've given you enough wisdom to handle this on your own.
- Thanks, Dad.
- I won't mention how important it is - to treat each other with respect.
- I got it.
I'm sorry, these Dad talks are hard to give up.
Why don't you say we just skip the speech go straight to the hugs and we'll start packing?
No, thank you.
Michelle.
Great start, Deej.
Dad would be proud.
Oh, would you mind closing the door on your way out?
Steph, come on.
I've given you five years.
Give me five minutes.
Fine, five minutes.
Ready.
Go.
Steph, I know we can work this out.
We always work things out.
Yeah, but this time it's personal.
Steph, we've been through way too much together to throw it away now.
We've laughed.
We've cried.
We weren't just roommates, we were soul mates.
Very touching.
Four minutes.
Steph, if you stay in here this could ruin everything.
Is this some kind of revenge because I've been such a terrible sister?
No.
You've been a great sister.
That's why I don't want you to leave.
If you go, I'll miss everything.
Listening in on your phone calls hearing if you got a date for the weekend then reading your diary to see how it went.
Steph, I'll be right down the hall.
You can visit me whenever you want.
My door is always open.
Unless it's closed, and then you knock.
But it won't be the same.
No, not exactly the same.
You're gonna be the big sister in the room.
Michelle's gonna look up to you just like you looked up to me.
But one thing will never change.
I'll always be your big sister, and I'll always love you.
I'll always love you too, Deej.
Now that we have the old team back together maybe between the two of us we can outsmart Michelle.
Piece of cake.
Michelle, can we come in?
Whose room is this?
It's your room.
Okay, come in.
Welcome to my room.
Michelle, if you don't move you're missing out on a wonderful experience.
Living with Stephanie was the happiest time of my life.
Then why don't you keep her?
Well, I've been happy long enough.
It's time for you to be happy.
This is my gift to you.
Michelle why don't you wanna live with me?
Because you called me a kindergarten baby.
I'm sorry.
What I meant to say was, "You're in kindergarten, baby"!
Nice try.
Come on, if you live with me, I'll give you a bag of cookies.
- Okay, I'll live with you.
- Really?
You're lucky I love cookies.
Well, Michelle, now that we're living together I only have one rule.
- I'm the boss.
- No, I'm the boss.
- No, I'm the boss.
- I'm the boss.
Oh, this is beautiful.
You two were made for each other.
- I'm the boss.
- I'm the boss.
- No, I am.
- No, I am.
- No, I'm the boss.
No, I'm the boss.
I'm the boss.
- Yes.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
All right, it's finally finished, Michelle.
My new brand-new studio.
What do you think?
Look at this.
I got a 16-track, keyboards, a big console.
Oh, look at this drum machine.
You'll like this, watch.
Huh?
Pretty cool, huh?
You've got better toys than I do.
To show my appreciation to your dad for letting me build a studio down here I got a great idea.
We'll do a song.
- What song do you wanna sing?
- Let's sing the spelling song.
All right, the spelling song it is.
Here we go.
One, two, one, two, three, four.
A-B-C-D-- Cut!
Not that spelling song.
The cool spelling song.
R-E-S-P-E-C-T Find out what it means to me Sock it to me, sock it to me Sock it to me, sock it to me Sock it to me Ho-ho-hold it, hold it, Michelle, hold it.
I'm sorry, but I just love those "sock it to me's".
Sock it to me, sock it to me Sock it to me, sock it to me Sock it to me, sock it to me-- Aah!
Heh-heh.
Kimmy, you've gotta tell me.
This is a nightmare.
What's a nightmare?
Uh, this whole savings-and-loan crisis.
Why are you hiding behind the counter?
Oh, I wasn't hiding.
I'm cleaning my cleaning products.
Oh, yeah, it's Friday.
Boy, Mr. T, you sure know how to kick off a weekend.
- See you.
- Hey, come back here, you.
Okay.
Spill it, Kimmy.
Why is everybody talking about me behind my back?
Because they don't have the guts to tell you to your face.
Well, gotta go.
Get back here, you coward.
Kimmy, start talking.
Uh, I love what you've done with your new room.
All you need now is a poster of Patrick Swayze on your ceiling.
Just kick back and hope the Scotch tape gives out.
Kimmy, please, I'm desperate.
Look at this card I got from Kathy Santoni.
"My thoughts are with you during your mega-crisis".
I can't believe it.
I'm having a mega-crisis, and I don't know what it is.
Deej, sit down.
I guess it's better if you hear this from your best friend.
The word that's going around is you're the worst kisser in school.
I am not.
- Who said that?
- Todd Mitchell.
Todd Mitchell?
I could kill him.
He walked me home from the library.
He tried to kiss me, but I didn't want to.
So I turned my cheek, and he slobbered all over my ear.
Ew!
He doggy-kissed you.
Come in.
No, wait.
So, honey, how was school today?
Fine, Mr. T, and thank you for caring.
Deej, you seemed a little upset downstairs.
I just want you to remember that you can talk to me about anything.
Dad, there is something I wanna say to you.
Oh, great, great.
I'm right here, honey.
Kimmy and I wanna be alone.
Fine.
Great, that's a good idea.
What's important here is we've opened up the door for communication.
Right, Dad.
Bye.
Bye.
Damage control.
This bad-kisser thing could ruin my social life forever.
Just how far has this rumor gone?
Hard to say.
I heard it from my algebra teacher.
Living on this side of the room is gonna be so cool.
I got the cool window, the cool closet and the cool mirror to look at my cool self.
I'm cool too.
Look at this.
You're not hanging up Barney the Bear in my room.
It's my room too.
Yes, it is.
And I have the perfect spot to hang Barney.
Right inside the closet where he can hibernate all winter.
Hey, is this a trick?
Michelle, bubee, baby, would I trick you?
Yes, you would, and don't call me bubee.
Hi, girls.
Steph, did you hear D.J. mention anything that might be bothering her?
Dad, I live with a kindergarten kid now.
The only hot rumors I hear are who put their mouth on the water fountain.
Daddy, could you put Barney over my bed?
Oh, you bet I can, honey.
I'll tack him up right over here where nobody can miss him.
Oh, careful, Danny.
Careful, Danny, careful.
Oh, thank you, Danny, that felt good.
Don't you think Barney looks cool?
The coolest.
I know some tricks too, bubee.
D.J.?
- Hi, Daddy.
- Michelle.
Don't scare Daddy like that.
Daddy just got whiplash.
What are you doing?
I'm just putting away some laundry.
But laundry day is Monday.
Yeah, well, I switched it with dusting day.
You know, just to keep life exciting.
Okay.
All right, observe very carefully as I screw in this light bulb.
Okay, all right, okay?
I only wish the twins were already born.
They'd be so proud of their dad.
Very cute.
Now, come on, this is very important.
When the light is on, it means that I am recording and I'm not to be disturbed for anything whatsoever.
What if Godzilla attacks, like in those old Japanese movies?
Godzilla is attacking, we must inform Jesse.
We can't, the red light is on.
You are the mother of all idiots.
Your insults have no effect on me.
Jess, this is a big moment.
I know, the first time working in my new studio.
No, I'm talking about our partnership.
You and I were in the ad business together for three years.
And now, you're committed to your music.
I'm going back to my comedy full-time.
It's the end of an era.
I'll miss you, man.
Joey, Joey, please, Joseph.
Get a grip, okay?
We live in the same house, we'll see each other.
Run along upstairs, the red light is on, that means I'm not to be disturbed.
Go, go, go.
I love you, I miss you.
Okay, go.
Okay, fine.
I can take a hint.
I've a very full and busy life of my own.
I'll just go upstairs, make some nachos, get ready for a little Yogi Bear.
Uh, Jess, there's one little problem.
This doorknob came off right in my hand.
That's impossible.
I installed it myself.
Well, that explains it.
Give it.
It's stripped.
We're locked in here.
We'll just yell for help.
Did you soundproof this room yourself?
- Yeah.
- Then they'll hear us.
- Hey, Becky.
Hey.
- The guys downstairs?
- Yeah.
Oh, wait.
The red light's on, that means they're recording.
JESSE AND JOEY : Help!
Help!
They're doing the Beatles song, "Help"!
Oh, man.
I could use some help myself.
D.J.'s having a mega-crisis, and she won't talk to me about it.
Well, if she won't talk to you how do you know she's having a mega-crisis?
Oh.
Well, I kind of, sort of, saw this card in her sock drawer when I was putting away the laundry.
It's not Monday.
Okay, I was snooping.
But it's driving me nuts that she won't talk to me.
I'll see you later, Dad.
I'm going over to Kimmy's.
Before you go, honey.
Look.
I have this feeling that you've got a problem and you're not sharing it with me.
Dad, there's no problem.
Kimmy, do I have a problem?
Well, your dad is kind of nosy.
Look, Dad, I'm fine, really.
I gotta run, bye.
Bye.
Did you see that?
She lied right to my face.
Well, I hate to get technical, but you lied too.
You never mentioned your little raid on her sock drawer.
What's happening to me and D.J.?
We used to be so close.
Becky, I feel like I'm losing my little girl.
Kimmy, we need a plan.
We have to get people to stop saying I'm a bad kisser.
I got it.
Just make out with every guy in school until they change their mind.
Deej, wait a second.
Um, look, I was just thinking.
You and I hardly have any time to hang out anymore.
What do you say we hang out tonight?
Dad, I can't just hang out with you.
Kimmy and I have plans.
- To do what?
- To hang out.
Come on, why don't you hang out with your dad?
You know what would be totally a blast?
We go bowling.
Whoo!
Gee, Mr. T, that sounds nifty.
Are Wally and the Beav coming too?
Oops.
One step too far.
Later, Deej.
Dad, I haven't been bowling since my seventh birthday.
Yeah, and you loved it.
Okay, Dad, if it means that much to you.
- Let's go bowling.
- That's my girl.
Just let me get my ball, my shoes my corn protectors, then we're out of here.
I can't take it.
That thing keeps looking at me.
That's because he likes you.
Michelle, here's a fun idea.
How would you like to be in the Big Girls Club?
I'm a big girl.
I should be in that club.
You're gonna love it.
It's got a secret song and everything.
Ooh!
How does it go?
Um.
I'm a big girl, you're a big girl Yada-yada-yada-yada-ya!
I like the little dance.
Now, all we have to do to get in the Big Girls Club is get rid of all our baby stuff.
Uh-oh.
You mean Barney, don't you?
There's nothing more babyish than a toy bear.
Well.
Okay.
Nice knowing you, Barney.
I know this is painful, so I'll get rid of Barney for you.
And I'll get rid of Mr. Bear for you.
Freeze.
Drop the bear.
Now, step away slowly.
You said no toy bears in the Big Girls Club.
But Mr. Bear is not a toy.
He's a member of the family.
So is Barney.
He keeps the monsters away.
There are no monsters in here.
See, he's doing a good job.
Okay, the bears stay.
Are we still in the Big Girls Club?
Yeah, yeah, whatever.
Yay!
I'm a big girl, you're a big girl Yada-yada-yada-yada-ya!
I can't hear you.
I'm a big girl, you're a big girl Yada-yada-yada-yada-ya!
One more time.
I'm a big girl, you're a big girl Yada-yada-yada-yada-ya!
If we get a running start and crash into that door, we'll break it right down.
That will never work.
It will if we hit it at the exact same time.
That door will pop right open.
- We got no choice.
- Okay.
We gotta do it together, and it's gotta be precise, so I'll count.
- All right.
- We'll go on three, you ready?
- Mm-hm.
- One, two, three, go.
- Hey, the light.
- Ow!
What happened to you?
You left the red light on.
No wonder nobody has come downstairs to get us.
It's a good thing I caught that.
Guys, lunch is ready.
Boy, I thought that red light would never go off.
You guys are really working hard.
Jess, I am very, very, very proud of you.
Ow!
Oh, Deej, isn't this fantastic?
You're doing great, honey.
Dad, all I did was write our names on the score sheet.
Well, since the last time you bowled, your handwriting has really improved.
- Okay, Dad, you're up.
- Right.
What I want you to know is the most important part of bowling is getting a good rhythm going, okay?
So first you do that.
Then push off, arm back, hop and swoop.
Go, baby.
Go, baby.
Go, baby.
Strike!
All right, the Dan man still has the touch.
Dad, we're in public.
Oh.
You know what?
This is just great.
Why don't we join a father-daughter league?
Something to think about very carefully.
All right, now, remember, push off, arm back, hop and swoop.
Go, baby.
Go, baby.
Go, baby.
Go-- No, baby.
No, baby.
Hey, we'll get them on the next ball, honey, don't worry about it.
That's why I'm here, to help you with your problems.
Whether they be in bowling, at home or at school.
Any of those pertain to you?
Dad, for the millionth time, I'm fine.
Second shot.
Okay, now, remember, Deej.
I know.
Stop, drop and roll.
No, that's what you do in case of a fire.
It might work here, though.
Go ahead.
Go, baby.
Go, baby.
Go, baby.
All right, one big one!
High five, low five, on the side.
Dad, no one does that anymore.
Oh.
Sorry, I just got carried away with all this father-daughter fun.
Okay.
Hey, Deej!
The pins are that way, Mr. T. What a nice surprise.
D.J., we have to get to the mall right away.
Dad, aren't you up?
Oh.
Right.
Guess who's down at the food court spreading more rumors about you.
Todd Mitchell.
We have to put a stop to this.
Hey, Dad, this has really been a lot of fun but do you mind if I go down to the mall with Kimmy?
Right now?
Deej, we're only in the second frame.
I paid for 10.
Well, one of my friends really needs me.
Thanks for understanding.
You're the best, Dad.
I won't be out too late.
This is so much fun.
Let's join that father-daughter league.
You bet, sweetheart.
- Hey, Dad?
- All right, D.J., you're back.
Can I borrow 10 bucks?
Oh, sure.
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
High five.
Daddy, Daddy, I got a strike!
That's my girl.
I love you, Daddy.
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, Deej.
Was everything all right at the mall?
Yeah, fine.
Deej, don't you think we should talk?
Okay.
So how did you bowl?
No, not about that.
I mean, what's going on with you.
I know you're having some kind of problem.
Dad, give me a break, it's no big deal.
Since when is a mega-crisis nothing?
Mega-crisis?
Where did you get that?
I don't know, it just kind of popped into my head just now.
You mean you just popped into my sock drawer and went through my personal property.
- How could you do that?
- It was an accident.
- I was putting away your laundry.
- It's not Monday.
You were spying on me, and you know it.
What was I supposed to do?
You wouldn't talk to me.
Maybe it was none of your business.
What's next, are you gonna bug my phone?
Hey, I don't like that tone, young lady.
Well, I don't like you invading my privacy.
I'm your father, I'll invade Normandy if I want to.
Look, just stay out of my sock drawer, and stay out of my life.
- Get back here right now, D.J. - I can't wait to get out of this house.
Hold it.
I'm not through talking to you yet.
Well, I'm through listening.
See, you don't even knock.
You have no respect for my personal space.
Don't you dare tell me about respect.
You're yelling at me and slamming doors.
- What happened to my sweet little girl?
- Don't you get it?
I am not your little girl anymore.
Oh.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry too.
Dad, I don't mean to hurt your feelings.
I just meant that I'm growing up.
I don't need to come to you with every little problem.
Why not?
You used to tell me everything.
That's when I was a kid.
When you were my age, did you go tell your parents everything?
No.
They were old.
They were my age.
Look, Dad, if there's some serious problem that I can't handle, I'm gonna come to you.
Just like I always did.
And I'll be here for you, Deej.
I know you will, Dad.
- I love you.
- I love you too.
I'm sorry, I should have never read that card.
Besides, switching laundry day threw off my whole cleaning schedule.
It's okay.
So you really wanna know about my mega-crisis?
Hey, I don't wanna pry.
I'm dying to know.
Well, see, I got this rep as the worst kisser in the school.
Oh, thank God.
Dad, that is not a good thing.
Oh, right, that's bad, right.
You see, I never even kissed this guy, but he started spreading this ugly rumor.
So Kimmy and I tracked him down at the mall.
Kimmy got him in a headlock, and I threatened him with a squirt bottle of mustard until he told everybody the truth.
Well, he did the right thing.
Those stubborn mustard stains are murder to get out.
Deej, I know you're kind of busy right now but wouldn't it be nice if we could both set aside some time just to hang out with each other once in a while?
Sure, Dad.
Let's go get some frozen yogurt.
My treat.
Do you mind if I drive?
I'm gonna get my learner's permit in a couple months.
Oh, man, it never ends.
I'll tell you what, I'll drive.
You can work the radio, okay?
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Wow, here's something interesting: "Genius pigeon graduates college".
Joey, how can you read that junk?
Oh, my God.
He went to the same school I did.
Attention all family members.
Report to the kitchen immediately.
Training camp is about to begin.
Don't try to run for it, I've got the house surrounded.
Move it, move it, move it.
- Hut, hut, hut.
Let's go.
- What's going on?
- What's wrong?
- Attention.
As you were.
God, I love the sound of my own voice.
This weekend, Tanners from all across this great country of ours are gathering at Lake Pollock for a fun family reunion and picnic.
First we're gonna hug them, then we're gonna kiss them and then once those picnic games begin we are gonna kick some Tanner behind.
Michelle you will be with Uncle Jesse in the balloon relay race.
All right.
We're gonna kick some Tanner behinds.
Where does she get this stuff?
Okay, D.J. and Steph you two will be tied together in the three-legged race.
We won't let you down, Dad.
Deej, we've gotta practice.
From now until the picnic, we'll spend day and night tied together.
Sounds like a dream come true.
Someone needs to work on her team spirit.
Joey!
As the only winner from our family last year we are counting on you to repeat as champion in the pie-eating contest.
I am the world's greatest pie-eater.
Nobody can touch me.
Aunt Phyllis, if you're out there doing your needlepoint, know this: I will destroy you!
Okay, man.
You can pump up with these.
- Get practicing.
- All right.
Who wants to spar with the champ?
I need a little competition here.
Oh, blueberry.
I'll try.
Okay, assume the position.
And, go!
Come on, come on, come on.
- Come on, Aunt Becky.
- Come on, Uncle Joey.
Come on, come on, come on.
Faster!
Come on, faster, guys!
Beat Aunt Becky!
Beat Aunt Becky!
Becky's gaining on you, Joey!
Come on!
She's gaining on you, Joey.
Come on!
Go!
We run out of forks?
Hi, honey.
Be with you in a jiff.
It's okay.
I'll just stay here and snack.
- Finished.
- We have a new champion.
- Great.
- Yes.
Hey, man, no fair.
She's having twins.
She's eating for three.
Besides, I think I had a blueberry up my nose.
This is all very fascinating, but I wanna tell you guys something.
I just met with a new record company.
They heard my music and loved it.
- Honey, that's great.
- It's not a done deal yet.
They said they'd give me a record contract if I come up with one great hit song.
I got very big news.
You're my partner in the balloon race.
Oh, right, at the picnic.
- Let's practice right now.
- All right, we will, I promise.
But right now I'll go downstairs and write the greatest song ever.
Just give me 10 minutes.
That is the kind of groundless confidence we need to win that Tanner family trophy.
Because we are the Bay Area Tanners and we are gonna win, right?
Aunt Phyllis, you are dead meat.
Come on, Deej, we have to practice for the three-legged race.
Steph, can't you see that I'm busy?
Dad, D.J.'s not showing any team spirit!
All right, all right, let's get this over with.
Okay, now tie it up real tight so it won't fall off.
Now, we have to practice day and night, night and day until we have it perfect, so we can win.
Okay.
Okay, now, let's practice walking first.
Ready, go.
That's my phone.
I bet it's Ben Andrews.
He's unbelievably hot.
I can't get this knot out.
Ben, don't hang up.
Steph, you're coming with me.
But we have to practice.
D.J.: We'll practice going upstairs.
Come on.
Inside, outside, inside, outside.
Ben, don't hang up.
Keep ringing.
Keep ringing.
Come on, hurry.
Inside, outside, inside, outside, inside, outside.
I'm coming, Ben.
I'm coming.
Keep ringing.
Keep ringing.
Keep ringing.
Keep ringing.
Keep ringing.
Hello?
- It's for you.
- Thanks.
I gave your number out for emergencies.
Hello.
Oh, hi, Eric.
I'm looking At three-day-old pizza crust I'll give it to Joey He'll eat anything Guess what time it is.
Time for me to write a decent song.
Nope.
It's time to practice.
You need to walk like this: Waddle, waddle, waddle.
Thank you, Michelle.
Now let me get back to my tune here.
You gotta practice too, partner.
All right, give me that.
Waddle, waddle, waddle.
There.
Now take off.
I gotta get back to my music.
Can I hear it?
Well, all right.
It's not really finished yet, but it starts like this: Then I do, like, a verse, then a chorus and a real nice bridge and then I do another chorus and it ends like this: - What do you think?
- You got nothing.
Tell me about it.
Write a song like this.
Five little speckled frogs Sitting on a hollow log Eating some most delicious bugs Yum, yum Thank you, Michelle.
One jumped into the pool Where it was nice and cool Now there are four speckled frogs Ribbit, ribbit Four little speckled frogs I'm inspired now.
Sitting on a hollow log Eating some most delicious bugs Yum, yum One jumped into the pool Where it was nice and cool Now there are three speckled frogs Ribbit, ribbit Three little speckled frogs Enough!
I hope you have a good reason for interrupting me.
I sure do.
Check this out, Jess.
Another Elvis sighting.
This time they spotted him in Portland, playing miniature golf with Bigfoot.
Hi, honey.
- How's the song going?
- Oh, terrific.
Great.
He gots nothing.
I got nothing because I got no privacy.
Can you please leave me alone?
Okay, Mr. Cranky Pants.
Out.
You don't want me to leave too?
Uh-huh.
After I waddled down here to bring you this snack?
Mm-hm.
Well, honey, don't take this the wrong way, but: Thank you.
- Uncle Jesse, I have an idea.
- Hmm?
You should write a song about a turtle and a duck.
Thank you, Michelle.
Run along.
A turtle and a duck.
Oh, there was a turtle and a duck Let's go, people.
It's picnic time.
Move it, move it, move it.
Oh, I am so proud of you girls.
You've mastered the three-legged walk.
It's as if you're not even tied together.
- We're not.
- We're not.
- Stop talking when I talk.
- Stop talking when I talk.
Becky, I just want you to know that I've entered the pie-eating contest as a wild-card entry.
Joey, you don't stand a chance.
Of course I do.
I've switched to the Tasmanian Devil technique.
Now, when I see that pie, it's gonna be like:  Hola, fellow picnickers.
My bag's in the van and I'm ready for action, coach.
Kimmy, as much as we'd love to have you on this trip, there's no room in the van.
Plus, you gotta be a member of the Tanner family.
But I am a member of the Tanner family.
At least that's what my parents keep telling me.
Everybody, I gotta talk to you.
Yay, Uncle Jesse's here!
Michelle, I think we've had enough bullhorn, okay?
All right, everybody into the van.
Get the luggage.
Move it, move it, move it.
Here, Uncle Jesse, wear your T-shirt.
It's a poly-cotton blend.
Dad said it wouldn't shrink, but I think it's just cheaper.
This is what I gotta talk to you about.
I've been up for four days, I can't come up with a song so I'm gonna pass on this picnic and stay home and work.
- What?
Why?
- What do you mean?
Well, look on the bright side, Tanners.
Now there's room in the van for me.
Jess, we need you now more than ever.
Yeah, it's just not the same without you.
Yeah, you've gotta go.
Come on, honey, it'll be good for you.
Yeah, relax, take your mind off your work for a while-- I wanna keep my mind on my work.
This is my one shot at a record deal.
But you're my partner in the balloon race.
- Well, get another partner.
- But you promised.
- Michelle, I can't.
- But you promised.
Michelle, I have to write a song.
- But you promised.
- Then I'm gonna break my promise.
I'm not going to the stupid picnic, so leave me alone.
- Jess.
- Uncle Jesse yelled at me.
Oh, Michelle, I'm sure he didn't mean anything by it.
Come on, we're still gonna have fun at the picnic.
Uncle Jesse not nice anymore.
I've just written The Brady Bunch theme.
Maybe no one will remember.
What am I saying?
And we'll all have chicken and dumplings When she comes When she comes And we'll all have chicken and dumplings And we'll all have chicken and dumplings And we'll all have chicken and dumplings When she comes When she comes One more time!
She'll be comin' 'round the mountain-- All right, all right.
Are we there yet?
No, honey, we're not at the motel yet.
When will we be there?
When we get there.
I was just asking.
Don't have a cow.
I think what Michelle's trying to say is she has to go to the bathroom.
No, I don't.
All right, I do.
Please, Danny.
I'm dying.
Didn't I say not to drink that thermos of Tang?
- But, Danny-- - Hey, don't make me come back there.
Dad, Kimmy's looking at me.
No, I'm not.
Kimmy, stop looking at Stephanie.
Something stinks.
Well, we're in the woods, honey.
It's probably a skunk.
I know that smell.
Kimmy, put your shoes back on.
Oh, give me a break.
Fresh cup of coffee, black, and keep it coming.
Switch to decaf, will you, son?
You're jangling my nerves.
I'm sorry, I just have a lot on my mind.
Hey, sonny, make me one of them sprout salads.
And put the Io-cal dressing on the side, will you?
Thank you, thank you very much.
I lost 72 pounds on this diet, man.
I got sprouts coming out my sideburns.
You know, you look exactly like.
Well, no, you're gone.
I mean, you're not gone, you're here, but-- Never mind me, I'm just having a bad day.
Go ahead, finish your salad.
You don't wanna hear my problems.
- Probably not.
- My problem is my family.
They're driving me nuts, so I blew up at them.
You see, I finally got a shot at a record deal but I gotta come up with one really great song.
And they're all mad because I'm not going to some stupid picnic.
Picnic?
They gonna have barbecue there?
I guess so.
But I don't have time for that.
My whole career's on the line.
Well, why aren't you home working on the record?
Well, I'm practically finished.
I just-- You know, I came out for a cup of coffee.
- You got nothing, do you, boy?
- Well, I-- I wrote a song about a turtle and a duck.
Not really top 40, though.
You wanna know what my real problem is?
Yeah, lay it on me.
See, I got twins coming.
You know, I want them to be proud of their old man.
I wanna be a success.
It's why I've been working so hard.
I want them to look up and see platinum records on the wall.
Babies don't care about platinum records.
All they care about is if their daddy loves them, is there to hug and kiss them.
Shame on you for snapping at your family.
Over a picnic?
I also broke a promise to my 4-year-old niece.
I wish you hadn't told me that.
You're so busy chasing your pot of gold you're forgetting what's really important.
If you wanna be a success, then you be a good father.
A good husband, a good friend.
After that, it's all gravy.
Oh, that sounds good.
Hey, sonny, throw some gravy on that salad, will you?
Well, it all makes a lot of sense.
Thanks a lot.
I don't know why I dumped all this on you.
I feel like I know you or something.
Hey, let me buy your meal.
Thank you, thank you very much.
I swear, the way you say "thank you, thank you very much".
- You remind me so much of-- - I know.
Wayne Newton.
Thanks a lot.
You have a nice night.
Listen, son, it's kind of cold out there.
You might need this.
Now, you take care of business.
Hey, son, throw some gravy, come on.
Thank you.
Let me see them mushrooms.
I hope they can fix the van.
What if they can't?
What if we're stuck here forever?
In that case, we're bear snacks.
All right, Danny, I think I got it.
Give it a try.
Oh, Joey.
All right, we did it!
We got the hood open.
Oh, man.
No wonder we broke down.
It's filthy under here.
We're in big trouble.
Somebody's coming.
I hope it's the ice cream man.
- All right.
- Honey, what are you doing here?
I was gonna meet you at the picnic.
Something wrong with the van?
Yeah, the engine is filthy.
Have a look for yourself.
Oh.
- Joey, give it a start.
- Okay.
All right.
All right, turn it off.
It's just a loose distributor cap.
Which you never would've found if I hadn't got the hood open.
Look, guys, you'll never guess who I met today in a diner.
- Who?
- It's a guy.
He looked exactly like Wayne Newton.
But we got to talking and I'm sorry I snapped at you guys today.
I just got so wrapped up in this record deal you know, riding around on my high horse that I forgot about the things that are important to me in my life.
And that's the people that I love.
You guys.
So I hope you can forgive me.
Oh, of course I can forgive you.
You can let go now, Kimmy.
Jess, don't be so hard on yourself.
We know what pressure you've been under.
No, we don't.
Come on, Michelle.
Can't you forgive your Uncle Jesse?
Your name is Uncle Meanie.
- You're still mad at me, huh?
- Duh.
Well, I deserve a "duh".
I'm sorry I let you down, kid.
You yelled and you broke a promise.
Well, if it makes you feel better, I felt terrible all day.
That helps a little.
All right then, how about this: You and I are gonna enter that balloon race and we're gonna win and have the most fun we've had in our life.
How do you like that?
That helps a lot.
All right, munchkin.
Come on, give me a little love.
Excuse me.
Everything okay here?
Yes, officer.
Okay, that's it then.
Why don't we go?
Everybody in the van.
Dad, haven't you polished that enough?
You're starting to wear off the inscription.
But I'm just so darn proud of you guys.
It was almost a total sweep.
We took the balloon relay and the three-legged race.
Too bad about the pie-eating contest.
Danny, we're really sorry we let you down.
Who would've known when Aunt Phyllis took out her dentures like that that she could gum down a pie that fast?
Everybody come down to the studio.
I want you to hear a new tune.
Great.
All right, it's the world premiere of this tune.
I don't know if the record company will like it, but I'm proud of it.
And I'll tell you something.
I couldn't have done it without you guys.
It goes a little something like this.
Sometimes you lose your place And all you're searchin' after Is right before your face Riding on your high horse Believing your own lies Don't you know When everyone is kneeling We're all the same size Just a little more love Is all we're hoping for Just a little more peace Is all we need Take away the colors Don't you understand It all breaks down To the heart of the man?
All one, think how strong we'd be If you and me give a little more love Break it down!
Take away the colors Don't you understand It all breaks down It all breaks down to the heart, child All of the one, all one All one, think how strong we'd be If you and me give a little more love It ain't that tough To give a little more love Take away the colors Don't you understand How strong we'd be If you and me give a little more love Love, love
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
You are welcome to play with my old tap shoes.
But keep in mind, tap dancing is a skill that requires grace and rhythm.
I got grace and rhythm.
How was that?
Well, we know the taps work.
Okay, now watch your big sister and see how it is done.
Tea for two And two for tea Me for you And you for me  Tea for two And two for tea  And that is how it is done.
Tea for two And two for tea Very good, Michelle.
For tea And tea for two And two for tea And tea for two What have I done?
Deej, I sure hope the twins are a boy and a girl because I picked out the perfect names.
Elvis and Priscilla.
Well, what if they're two girls?
Well, then I'll name them Priscilla and Elvisa.
So if you get two boys you're gonna name them Elvis and Priscillo?
See, I didn't think about-- No, that's good.
See, I gotta think this through.
It's so important what you name your kid because it can determine the whole personality.
You think I'd have cool hair and a great band if my name was Marvin?
Marvin and the Rippers?
I don't think so.
Why are you so obsessed over this name thing?
Well, I don't want my kids going through what I. Never mind.
Never mind what?
Never mind.
Okay, you have a secret.
I'll just go digging through your past until I. Till you what?
Never mind.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Hey, Jess.
Hey, Joe.
You look good.
How'd your act go over at the club last night?
I bombed.
Those foreign tourist groups are tough crowds.
I had to keep waiting for the interpreter to translate my Bullwinkle.
Thank you, good evening.
My life's going nowhere.
Oh, come on, what happened to the happy-go-lucky grinning Joey we all know and love?
He's gone forever, man.
Jess, no matter what I do, I can't catch a break.
Come on, today's a brand-new day.
Yeah, until I read my bad review in the paper.
Well, no paper today.
There's a paper strike.
See that?
Your luck's already changing.
Talk to me.
Joey, it's KFLX Radio.
No, I don't know how much Deputy Dawg weighs.
- What am I, an idiot?
- Don't hang up!
Hello.
Yes.
Without his gun and badge, Deputy Dawg weighs exactly 43 pounds.
Really?
I just won two tickets to the Donny and Marie reunion.
My name's Joey Gladstone.
I'll be by to pick the tickets up this afternoon.
No, thank you.
Oh, wait, I almost forgot.
I gotta wait for the cable guy.
He's supposed to be here between 9 and 6.
No way, I'm not that lucky.
Hi, I'm Linda from Hilltop Cable.
You're the cable guy?
Hold on, don't move.
Come right in, the TV's in the living room.
- You're Joey Gladstone, aren't you?
- Uh-huh.
I've seen your act.
You are very funny.
You must have seen it in English.
TV, living room.
Jess, I think she likes me.
How do I look?
Well, you got the Hugh Hefner robe thing happening, that's a plus.
But I'd buff up the Ninja Turtle slippers.
I already buffed them once, but I'll buff them again.
Well, everything seems to be okay now.
I put a booster on your cable out back.
Oh, thanks.
Wow, we never got the Truck- and Tractor-Pull Network before.
Let's just say that's our little secret.
Oh, thanks, Linda.
You know, this is really turning out to be a great day.
Oh, not for me.
I just tried to get Donny and Marie tickets but they're sold out.
That's amazing.
I just won two front-row seats.
You wanna go?
Sounds great.
Um.
Here's my number.
- Call me later?
- Absolutely.
Oh, I love your slippers.
I'll wear them tonight.
- Bye.
- Thank you.
Jess, I got the date.
I'm on the roll of a lifetime.
See that?
That extra buffing paid off.
- Let's watch Wake Up, San Francisco.
- Oh, okay.
Hi, we're back with a special guest who works right here at Channel 8.
I grew up watching this man.
He was like a father figure to me.
Not that I didn't have a great father.
Although my dad did wear socks with his sandals, which got kind of cheesy-- Danny.
Danny, we're only a half-hour show.
Here he is.
The host of San Francisco's favorite cartoon kiddie show, Ranger Roy.
Howdy ho, junior rangers.
- Howdy ho, Ranger Roy.
- Howdy ho, Ranger Roy.
I used to love this guy.
I used to watch him every day when I was a kid.
Now everyone give themselves an official Ranger Roy bear hug!
You got that date just in time.
And now I have an announcement to make to all your viewers.
After 30 years in the Enchanted Forest me and my buddy, Merle the Squirrel, are retiring.
- Right, Merle?
- Right, Roy.
We're packing up our nuts and moving to Florida to an enchanted condo.
Don't worry, junior rangers.
I'll be choosing a new ranger to carry on the cartoon fun.
I'd be perfect for that job.
You know, my best friend Joey would be perfect for that job.
I'm interviewing today.
Bring him on down.
I can't wait to tell him-- - Jess, this is a dream come true.
I can't believe it.
It's my lucky day.
If you want your luck to last, let go.
Tea for two And two for tea Tea for two And two for tea You're not watching.
Michelle, I watched all the way to school.
I watched during school.
I watched all the way home from school.
I watched, and I watched, and I watched.
Good, now watch this.
Tea for two And two for tea Tea for two And two for tea Tea for two And two for tea Tea for two And two for tea Hey, girls, I'd like you to meet a very special friend of mine.
Say hello to Mr. Woodchuck.
Hi, girls.
Hello, Mr. Woodchuck.
Say, I'm very hungry.
Is that tap board made of wood?
Mr. Woodchuck's gonna audition with me today at the Ranger Roy Show.
And I know I'm gonna get it because today is my lucky day.
Now, if I could just remember where I put my car keys.
A $20 bill, this is my lucky day.
Can you believe that?
Huh?
My lost Binaca.
I can't miss.
Ahh.
- Wanna see something amazing?
- Sure.
Tea for two And two for tea Tea for two And two for tea Tea for two And two for tea Thanks for meeting my friend Joey.
- Good luck today.
- Tanner, I never shake hands.
Oh, of course, you invented the Ranger Roy bear hug.
- Lay one on me.
- Get away from me.
What's the matter?
Well, now that I'm retiring, I can tell you the truth.
I suffer from acute physical paranoia.
Anyone touches me, I hyperventilate and break out in hives.
That's why I started that whole "hug yourself" thing.
Howdy ho, Ranger Roy.
Oh, this is the comedy genius I was telling you about, Joey Gladstone.
- Pleasure to meet you, sir.
- Good luck, Joey.
You can't touch him.
Well, nobody can touch him, he's a living legend.
But if anybody's gonna fill his hiking shoes, it might as well be me.
Ranger Roy, here.
Check this out, sir.
Uh, Mr. Woodchuck, Merle the Squirrel lives here in the enchanted tree house.
How would you like living there?
Well, I have been looking to branch out.
RANGER  Cute.
What else have you got?
Well, basically, sir, I do every cartoon voice known to man.
Well, blow me down.
Whoa.
Eh, what's up, doc?
Oh, I hate that rabbit.
Jetson, get in here.
I'm sorry, George.
Gladstone, you're the man I've been looking for.
- Really?
I got the job?
- Mm.
Oh, thank you, Ranger Roy, sir, Your Highness, Your Woodsiness.
I love you.
Joey.
- Stop hugging him, Joey.
- You don't know what this means to me.
I'm just as choked up about this as you are.
Just let-- Let go of the man.
Thank you so much for the job.
I gotta call my agent.
This is the luckiest day of my life!
Forgive Joey.
He didn't know what he was doing.
You made a real smart move by hiring him.
He's fired.
- Come on, go, baby, go!
- Go, go, go!
- Pull it, pull it, go, go!
- Go, go!
- Yes!
- Yes!
Boy, how did we ever live without the Truck- and Tractor-Pull Channel?
Somebody took my tap shoes.
Does that finger in my face mean you think it's me?
Duh.
Steph, what do you know about this?
Well, I know I'm just as sad about this tap-shoe tragedy as she is.
Oh, please.
Howdy ho, junior rangers.
Guess who is the new Ranger Roy!
- All right!
- Joey, you got the job.
You guys, talk about a lucky day.
First a newspaper strike saved me from a bad review.
Then I won tickets to Donny and Marie.
Then a beautiful woman came over and fixed our cable and she's going out with me tonight.
I'd pinch myself, but I'd probably just strike oil.
You guys are gonna love this.
I found out why Uncle Jesse is so obsessed with finding cool names for the twins.
I called Grandma, and she said that Uncle Jesse's real name is Hermes.
Hermes?
I married a Hermes?
I got a Uncle Hermes?
Yep.
He was teased so much in kindergarten that he begged Grandma to change it to Jesse.
Hey, those are my tap shoes.
Drop them.
You guys see what Comet dug up?
Well, you know how dogs like to bury things.
In a plastic bag?
Stephanie Tanner, you should be ashamed of yourself.
All right, I did it.
And I'm glad.
All day long it's been: "Tea for two," tap, tap, tap.
"Tea for two," tap, tap.
I couldn't take it anymore!
It was either get rid of those tap shoes or lose my mind.
"Tea for two," tap, tap, tap.
"Tea for two," tap, tap.
Thank you for finding my shoes, Uncle Hermes.
You're welcome.
What did you call me?
Uncle Hermes.
That's your name.
Who told you my name was Hermes?
- Grandma.
- She's lying.
Jess.
Okay.
It's Hermes.
Hermes is not only the Greek god of swiftness but it's also my great-grandfather's name.
I'll have you know he saved the whole town from destruction when he raced a river of lava down a mountain barefoot.
All right?
He went to tell the whole town that the volcano erupted.
No one was left in the town because who could miss a volcano erupting?
The point I'm trying to make is the name Hermes is equated with strength, courage and very hot feet.
So now, who among you will make fun of a name so bold and so courageous as Hermes, huh?
I'm sorry, honey.
We didn't realize the name meant so much to you.
Did you want me to call you Uncle Hermes?
No, what am I, some kind of geek?
Come here.
Joey, I gotta talk to you about something.
I know, the newspaper strike's over and I got a bad review.
But who cares?
I'm gonna be Ranger Joe.
- They can't touch me.
- Joey, listen--  Oh, hold on, one second.
Hello?
Uh-huh.
Well, I'll be down right away to pick up the tickets.
Oh, no.
My fourth cousin's a janitor at KFLX.
All family members are disqualified from winning the Donny and Marie tickets.
Uh-huh.
Well, sure, I'll take a KFLX sweatband.
Mm-hm.
Bye.
Boy, of all the rotten luck.
Yeah, speaking of rotten luck--  Just a second.
- Oh, hi, Linda.
- Joey, bad news.
Oh, no.
They're taking away my Truck- and Tractor-Pull Network, aren't they?
Worse.
The whole cable's out.
But we're still on for that concert, right?
Well, it turns out I don't have those tickets after all.
That is so typical.
You were just using me.
No, I wasn't.
I swear.
You want a KFLX sweatband?
Sure, where is it?
I don't have it right now.
Oh, there's a shock.
Boy, if this wasn't my lucky day, I'd be a little blue right now.
Joey, sit down, carefully.
Look, um I think Ranger Roy is having second thoughts about giving you the job.
Why?
What did he say?
- He said you were fired.
- What are you talking about?
He loved me so much he was speechless.
That's because he couldn't breathe.
He has a condition known as acute physical paranoia.
Oh, no.
I was on him like a piranha on a pork chop.
Oh, my God.
I have to stop that thank-you telegram I sent him.
How could a telegram hurt?
- Danny, it's a Hug-O-Gram.
- A what?
A guy dressed in a bear suit who hands you balloons and gives you a great big bear hug.
I even paid extra for the tummy rub.
I'm no expert, but I'd say your lucky streak is over.
Maybe not.
Maybe I can still get a second shot at that job.
I gotta stop that bear.
STAGE  We're on in one minute.
Ranger Roy?
For me?
And a Hug-O-Gram from Joey Gladstone.
No, stop that bear!
Get off him, it's a mistake.
Get off him.
The man can't stand to be touched.
Hey, buddy!
- Sorry about this.
I still owe you for the tummy rub.
Yeah, you do.
Ranger Roy.
I guess you got your bear hug, huh?
Kids, why don't you go find a stump?
We're on in 15 seconds.
- Tanner, cover for him.
- Me?
Here, here.
Take Merle!
I don't know anything about puppets.
Except if you machine-wash, their eyes come off.
That's good enough.
You're on.
In five, four, three, two.
Ranger Roy, Ranger Roy Loved by every girl and boy He's Ranger Roy Howdy ho, junior rangers.
Howdy ho, Daddy.
Where's Ranger Roy?
He's taking a little breather.
It doesn't matter, because I'm here.
I'm Ranger Dan.
If you're a ranger, where's your uniform?
Oh, well, that's a very good question.
And here's the answer.
He's an undercover ranger.
Hey, thank you, Earl.
It's Merle.
He's funny.
Okay, you know what?
It's time to meet my deputy ranger.
Come on over here, and, everybody, let's say, "Howdy ho, Ranger Joe".
No, thank you, Ranger Dan.
What Ranger Joe doesn't realize is this could be his big chance to be somebody.
Forget it.
My luck's run out.
Ah, there's a good lesson to be learned, boys and girls.
You make your own luck in this crazy, mixed-up world.
Sit down, buddy.
Kids, let's all give a big "howdy ho" to Ranger Joe.
Howdy ho, Ranger Joe!
Go get them, buddy.
Howdy ho, junior rangers.
Junior rangers, what do you say we say hello to the hippest, coolest critter in the forest, Mr. Woodchuck.
Thank you, Ranger Joe.
Thank you, kids.
So how do you like living here in the Enchanted Forest?
Well, it looks delicious.
I've never seen so much wood.
It kind of reminds me of where I'm from.
Oakland.
Hey, kids, how would you like to hear a Mr. Woodchuck joke?
Yeah!
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?
- Isador.
- Isador who?
Isador made of wood?
Howdy ho, junior rangers.
Howdy ho, Ranger Roy!
Well, junior rangers, it looks like Ranger Roy's back in the Enchanted Forest.
So I'll just take a hike to the Enchanted Unemployment Office.
Not so fast.
I have an announcement.
This show is the last one for Merle and me.
Aww.
But the good news is, Ranger Joe is taking over.
Yeah!
Shucks, golly, you really mean it, Ranger Roy?
The smiles on these faces show me that I've made the right choice.
So here's your official ranger hat.
Wow, it fits and everything.
This is the luckiest day of my life.
Okay, kids.
Now let's give Ranger Joe a great big bear hug.
Okay, kids, cut it out.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Good morning.
- Hey, good morning.
- Good morning.
- You guys missed breakfast.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I was up all night with this belly.
Did you guys ever try to sleep with a watermelon in your pajamas?
Yeah, once.
Yeah, it was a pretty rough night for me too.
What are you talking about?
You were sleeping like a baby, all cuddled up with your blankie.
You have a blankie?
How adorable.
It's not a blankie, it's a blanket.
All right, it's Mr. Blanket.
Beck, look, I'm sorry you can't sleep.
I feel bad for you.
I mean, I wish I could carry those twins for you.
Oh, gee, Jess, you're really going out on a limb there.
No, I mean it, I would like to know how it feels to be pregnant.
Good.
I'll arrange it.
What does she mean by, "Good, I'll arrange it"?
I don't know, but medical science is doing some pretty darn amazing things nowadays.
Becky, wait up!
Hey, Dad, don't forget I'm gonna be home late after school today.
I'm meeting Eddie Johnson, my adopted grandparent, at the nursing home.
I'm really proud of you, Deej.
Volunteering to spend some of your free time visiting a senior citizen, it's great.
Well, I'm kind of nervous about meeting Eddie.
I mean, what am I gonna talk to him about?
He's 75 years old.
Well, you talk to him about his life.
He's been through the Great Depression two world wars, five Stooges.
Ask him how he felt the first time he saw Curly use that eye-gouge deflector.
Oh, why you-- Thanks, you've been a big help.
Come on, Deej.
Eddie's gonna like you a lot.
You're a terrific girl, and you're doing a wonderful thing.
You make me realize that there's a lot of hope for the younger generation.
Hey, Deej, guess how many corn dogs I can fit in my mouth.
Six.
Eight if I remove the sticks.
Then again, "hope" might be too strong a word.
- Have a good day.
- Bye, Dad.
Bye, Joey.
Bye, girls.
Okay, ready to jump, Comet?
One, two-- Time-out.
Why can't Comet jump over you?
Because I'm the trainer, and you're the thing he jumps over.
Okay, just asking.
Okay, ready, Comet?
One, two, three, jump!
If you wanna see tricks, you should see my dog, Coco.
Drinking from the toilet is not a trick.
It is when she does it through a straw.
- Coco's the smartest dog on the block.
- Oh, yeah?
Why don't we invite all the dogs on the block to come over after school to do their best trick?
Then we'll see whose dog is the smartest.
Well, you're on.
I know Coco's smarter than Comet.
Kimmy, you're not even smarter than Comet.
Okay, old-timer, what's the name of this game?
- Gin.
- That's the name.
That's $24,000 you owe me.
Just put it on account.
Yeah, on account of you got no money.
Eddie, you have a visitor.
Hi, Mr. Johnson, I'm D.J. Tanner from the Adopt-A-Grandparent program.
I'm here to visit you.
Well, say, yeah, I got a little time before Love Connection starts.
Check her in.
Start visiting.
So, Eddie.
So, D.J. What was the Great Depression like?
How does it sound?
Depressing?
Good answer.
Yeah.
Well, you know, you smile just like my little girl, Gloria.
- Really?
- Yeah.
She's all grown up now, living in Florida.
I haven't seen her since.
Hey, wait a minute, what are we doing here?
We're supposed to be having fun.
You know how to play bumper pool?
- No.
- Me neither.
Grab yourself a cue over there.
We'll learn together.
Comet, you remember what to do?
Michelle, do you remember what to do?
Duh.
Okay, ready to jump, Comet?
Jump.
Way to go, Comet.
Good boy.
Good dog, Comet.
Here's your treat.
Good girl, Michelle.
Here's your treat.
Hey, this is a liver snap.
Oh, sorry, I gave Comet your cookie.
What a rip-off.
Jess, come on.
Come on.
You said you wanted to know what it was like to be pregnant.
Now, get down here.
You done?
Not yet.
Okay, now I'm done.
I'm not wearing this thing.
It's gotta weigh 25 pounds.
Wait a minute, so does this thing.
I went through a lot of trouble to get that sympathy pad from my childbirth coach.
If you really wanted to know what I was going through you would wear it for more than five minutes.
Unless, of course you're not man enough to be pregnant.
I'm as much man as you are.
Oh, yeah?
Fine.
I'll make you a little bet.
Since we've been arguing over wallpaper for the nursery I'll bet you that you can't last one day in that pad.
And if I win, I get to put up my choice.
Fun at the circus.
Yeah, and when I win, we'll put up my choice.
Elvis the wallpaper.
You know, Jess, you can talk the talk but can you walk the walk?
Yes, Eddie, that is three games in a row.
Okay, okay, so that's $24,000 I owe you.
Get it from him.
Eddie, I'll see you next week.
I have to get home.
My sisters are having this dog show.
I promised I'd be the judge.
Oh, boy, would I love to go to a dog show.
I mean, a man who loves dogs as much as me that would just about make my day.
Would you like to go to the dog show?
Oh, if you insist.
Well, great.
Do we need to get permission for you to leave?
What do you think?
I gotta ask just to get out of this door?
I've done whatever I want all my life except for those 41 years I was married.
- Well, great, let's go.
- Okay-- Let me just tell my friend I'm stepping out.
D.J.: Okay.
Hey, I'm getting out of here, you old goat.
I'm going to a dog show.
That little girl isn't allowed to take you out of here.
What if you have one of your spells out there?
I'm not gonna have any of my spells.
Now, just here.
Take-- Hold on to this candy bar.
I'm not allowed to eat candy.
I know that.
Just hold on to it.
Uh, nurse, Ferguson is over there trying to sneak a candy bar.
- Go on over there and nail him.
- Mr. Ferguson.
- Shall we?
- I'd be delighted.
Follow me, Eddie.
The dog show's in the backyard.
Eddie, this is my Uncle Jesse.
How you doing, Eddie?
Oh, boy, a pregnant man.
I gotta get out more often.
No, see, Eddie, I'm not really pregnant.
See, I'm-- I had this bet with my pregnant wife and she bet I can't wear this for 24 hours.
Let me tell you, it's been two hours and I feel great.
Of course, my back hurts, my ankles are beginning to swell and I think I'm retaining water.
Oh, good, Deej, you're here.
We're ready to start the dog show.
- Eddie, this is Joey.
- Hi.
Well, Joey, what branch of the service are you in?
Actually, I'm Ranger Joe from the Enchanted Forest.
Hey, let's just get going, huh?
You do have that special glow.
Hey, Eddie, you can help me judge the dog show.
Eddie, are you coming?
What?
Oh, yeah.
Come on, Gloria.
You gotta hurry.
You're gonna be late for school.
- What are you talking about?
- Huh?
Well, you just called me Gloria.
I'm D.J. Hey, yeah, I know who you are.
Come on, D.J., we gotta get to that dog show.
Hi.
- Hey.
Well, I picked up first prize for the dog show.
A pooper-scooper.
- So how's your bet with Becky coming?
- It's going good.
I'm gonna take this off for a while because my back is killing me.
Yeah, but, Jess, that would be cheating.
Don't be such a goody-goody.
I'm not cheating because of me.
It's for guys across the country who shoot off their mouths and suffer for it.
Here, you watch the kitchen door.
I'll watch the front door.
Gotcha.
You know, I know us men are cheated out of experiencing the miracle of birth but who cares.
I bet I could take the weights out of that and put feathers in and Becky would never know the difference.
My neck is killing me.
Thanks, Danny.
Oh, could you get my back?
Hey, who's watching the kitchen door?
I am.
- Then who's?
- Take a wild guess.
Oh!
Hi, Beck.
Thanks a lot.
She didn't come through my door.
Beck, I'm sorry, I was just taking a break.
Look, I'm strapping this puppy right back on.
No, no, no.
That's not how it works, buddy boy.
I can't unstrap this puppy.
You lost.
I get to pick the wallpaper.
Fun at the circus.
That nursery is gonna be full of clowns, all laughing at you.
All right, all right, you win.
I admit it, you babes are pretty tough to carry that around for nine months.
Oh, well, I know I complain sometimes, but the truth is it's worth it.
Carrying our twins has been the most wonderful experience of my life.
You're incredible.
How does a total body massage sound?
Oh, like heaven.
Good, because I could really use one.
Okay, guys, when we win first place there'll be something extra in each of your bowls.
It better not be dog food.
Okay, next up, you've seen him at all the local fire hydrants.
You've even chased him off your own lawn.
Now, here he is in person.
Give it up for Sparky!
Thanks, Ranger Joe.
Sparky will now do his funny walk.
Yay.
I give him four stars.
That little wiener Sparky's gonna be tough to beat.
I wonder why Kimmy didn't show up with Coco.
Because her dog's a chicken.
Hey, I made a joke.
Okay, now it's time for our last contestant.
He's a Pisces.
He loves windsurfing and rubber pork chops.
Please say hello to the amazing Comet!
And the amazing thing he jumps over.
And now, Comet will fly through the air, over my little sister and land on the other side.
Okay, on your mark.
- Get set--  Sorry I'm late.
We've gotta do this fast.
I've gotta get Coco back in my mother's lap before she wakes up.
Okay, Comet, go!
Come on, Comet.
Do your stuff.
Comet, like this.
Oh, that was an excellent jump, sweetheart.
I did my job.
Where's my cookie?
And now, for your listening pleasure Coco Gibbler will accompany me in "Polly Wolly Doodle All the Day".
Oh, I went down South For to see my Sal Take it, Coco.
I think Comet and Coco are in love.
If they get married, that would make us in-laws.
Comet, think about this.
Sure, she's all fluffed up and groomed now but how's she gonna look in the morning?
Okay, the decision of the judges is unanimous.
Eddie?
And the winner is the dog with the funny walk, Sparky.
We won!
We won!
All right, young man here is your prize.
A pooper-scooper?
Haven't you ever heard of a trophy?
Why don't I show you how good that pooper-scooper works?
Teddy, why don't you give it a try over here.
Hi, I'm Nurse Thomas from the Golden Gate Nursing Home.
Um, D.J., Eddie was not allowed to leave the home without being signed out by a family member.
He never told me that.
Where is Eddie?
He was here a minute ago.
He's probably in the house.
Is Eddie okay?
I'm afraid not.
Come on.
Eddie?
Here you are.
You cleaned up your room real nice, Gloria.
Gloria?
You're doing it again.
Now, you be nice or I'm not gonna let you watch Howdy Doody.
Howdy Doody?
That was on before I was born.
Eddie, why are you doing this?
Doing what?
You just called me Gloria and said I couldn't watch Howdy Doody.
I did?
I was just playing around, D.J. Eddie, there's a nurse here looking for you and I think we're both in trouble.
Why didn't you tell me you weren't supposed to leave?
So I snuck out and had a good time.
Now, what's the big deal?
The big deal is you're not allowed out without permission.
Come on, D.J., you worry too much.
Everything's fine.
Everything's not fine.
I wanna be your friend, but friends need to tell each other the truth.
You want the truth?
Most of the time, I'm fine but every now and then, they say that my mind sort of drifts off.
But I always find my way back.
Are you gonna be all right?
Hey, come on, Eddie Johnson's a fighter.
He's in here.
Eddie, not good.
Don't shoot.
I'll go peacefully.
Hey, I'm really sorry if I caused you all this trouble.
And if you don't come to visit me anymore I'll understand.
But I gotta tell you this has been one of the best days I've had in a long time.
I had a great time too.
Okay, let's go back.
Bye.
Dad I was talking to Eddie and he didn't know who I was.
Well, sweetheart, the nurse told me that Eddie is showing the early signs of Alzheimer's disease.
It affects his memory and sometimes he doesn't know where he is or what he's doing.
Is he gonna get better?
Well, the truth is if he has Alzheimer's he's gonna get worse.
And there's no cure?
Not yet.
I can't believe this.
I really liked Eddie.
What am I supposed to do?
Just keep going back there and watch him get worse and worse?
I know, I know.
This is not an easy thing to do.
Why did I become a volunteer?
Why did you?
Well, because I wanted to help people.
Well, I think you know the best way to help somebody is by being their friend.
Did you see Eddie at the dog show laughing today?
He just said today was one of the best days he's had in a long time.
That's all thanks to you, Deej.
You can do a lot for him just by brightening up his day and giving him someone to look forward to.
I'll be right back, Dad.
We gotta start taking field trips to this house.
In one afternoon, I saw a dog show a man in a ranger suit and a pregnant man.
Eddie, you need a nap.
Eddie, wait.
Um, I wanted to ask you something.
Would you stay for dinner with me and my family?
Actually, we'd love to have you both.
Well, I need to get back to work but Eddie can stay if he wants.
I couldn't impose.
But just out of curiosity, what are you having?
- Lasagna.
- I'll impose for lasagna.
Bye.
Behave.
- Bye-bye.
D.J.: Bye.
Would you like to help me set the table?
I'd be delighted.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
What are you doing?
Waiting for Jeremy to call.
That's it.
I don't care how cute his dimples are or how bad I need a date for Friday.
I wait for no man.
For more than an hour and a half.
I'm pathetic.
Hello.
Hi, Jeremy.
You're late.
Is that Jeremy?
Hey, Mr. Dimples, D.J. waits for no man.
Michelle.
He sounded cute.
Next time, give the guy a break.
Howdy ho, Jess.
Oh, howdy ho, Ranger Joe.
Hey, don't I get a "Howdy ho, Mr. Woodchuck"?
Oh, the joys of living with a kiddie-show host.
Have a good show today, Joe.
Say, something looks delicious.
I'm making beef stew.
I was talking about the spoon.
Is it made of wood?
Get out of my face or it's gonna be woodchuck stew, okay?
Well, aren't we Mr. Grumpy-Rump?
Back off, Bucky.
- Make me, mousse-hair.
- You wanna take this outside?
I'm arguing with a puppet here.
And you're losing.
Okay, Dad, you thought it over.
Can I do it?
Please, please, please?
Guys, tell him to let me do it.
Come on, Danny, what's the big deal?
Let her do it.
Do what?
Steph's teacher thinks she might have a career as a professional dancer.
Only one thing's stopping me from being the happiest I've been in my whole life.
Of all people.
Steph, this is a big commitment you're talking about.
It means taking special classes before and after school and on weekends earlier bedtimes and less TV.
I don't care what it takes.
I'll do anything.
Come on, Danny, the kid's got a dream.
If I focused on my music in the '70s, who knows what would've happened.
Yeah, it might've been you singing "Macho Man" in that headdress.
I would not have been in the Village People.
If I were, I'd have been the construction guy.
You know, when I was Steph's age all I ever dreamed about was winning an Olympic gold medal in the high jump.
To this day I sometimes wonder, if I'd given it my all would I have made it?
- No.
- No.
Do you want me to go through my whole life wondering if I would've made it?
Whoa, good guilt.
Dad, I promise I won't let you down.
Please let me do it.
Please, please, please?
Okay, if this is what you really want.
I won't be like my dad was when he refused to let me put a high-jump pit in the living room.
If this is your dream, sweetie, you go for it.
Thanks, Dad.
Thanks, guys.
You go out there and be the best darn high jumper you can be.
Dad, I'm a dancer.
That's even better.
Okay, Michelle, I'll stuff the envelope and you put the stamp on it.
Ew, gross.
Don't you have some chocolate stamps?
Becky, there's no way you'll get Jesse to go to your baby shower.
You'd have to club him over the head, tie him in a sack and drag him there.
Joey, this is the '90s.
Men are much more open-minded about these things.
Now D.J., don't you think your Uncle Jesse would like to go to his own baby shower?
Sure, if you club him, sack him and drag him.
No, I can't club him.
But I can trick him.
That's what I'll do.
I'll make it a coed baby shower, and I'll invite all of his buddies.
But I'll tell him it's a regular party.
And then when he shows up, he'll just have to go along with the whole thing.
- We're all gonna keep this secret, right?
- Right.
- Right.
- Right.
Oh, no.
She's never kept a secret in her life.
Uh-huh.
You don't know when I put on your makeup.
Oops.
Hey, what's going on?
Nothing, Uncle Jesse.
Like I said, what's going on?
We don't have a secret.
Right, Aunt Becky?
Well, okay, sweetheart, you caught me.
I wanted to have a party.
You know, one big final monster blowout before we become parents.
Really?
That's a good idea.
What can I do?
Nothing.
Nothing at all.
I'll take care of everything and all you have to do is show up.
- How does that sound?
- Sounds good to me.
What sounds good to you?
Nothing.
I don't wanna miss this party.
Now, that's how you keep a secret.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, Michelle, my darling.
I have a surprise for you.
Whoa, baby.
Not so fast.
You little sugar freak.
All right, now, Michelle.
While I make this triple-dip double-fudge whipped-cream sundae with a cherry on top just out of curiosity, is there some kind of I don't know, secret about this party Becky's throwing?
I can't tell you.
- You missed a spot.
- Thank you.
Well, Michelle, you know I sure would love to share this ice-cream sundae with you.
I'd sure love that too.
Mmm, well, then, let's talk about that secret, shall we?
What do I do?
What do I do?
Well, you can start by holding this spoon while I put on these chocolate sprinkles.
- Chocolate sprinkles?
- Uh-huh.
And your favorite and mine.
The cherry.
The party is a baby shower.
Now, drop that cherry.
Aha, a baby shower.
It's worse than I thought.
Thanks, Michelle.
You're welcome.
Is there anything else you wanna know?
No, there's nothing else I wanna know.
I'd hate to spoil your dinner.
Let me have a bite.
Do you wanna help put up decorations for Aunt Becky's baby shower?
I wish I could, but I've gotta get to my dress rehearsal.
You know, I have to give you credit.
Ever since you started taking these dance classes all I've seen you do is eat, sleep and dance.
If I had your discipline and dedication I'd have no life.
Comet, I have a life.
I have friends.
Who I never see anymore.
And I have my family.
Who I never see anymore.
But I have eight hours free every night.
Of course, that's when I'm sleeping.
Who am I kidding?
I have no life.
You're right, Comet.
I'm gonna tell Dad I quit.
You guys are gonna love these shower games.
We have Guess the Number of Diaper Pins.
- Ooh.
- Ooh.
Name that Baby Food.
- Ah.
- Ah.
And the always popular Draw the Baby on a Paper Plate on Your Head.
I feel so much better about giving away those 49er tickets.
Hey, Beck, where are you?
- Um, I'm up here, sweetheart.
Oh, there you are.
Are you sure there's nothing I can do for this blowout party you're throwing?
Nope.
Everything's taken care of.
Everything's taken-- Isn't she a jewel?
The way she babies me and showers me with love?
Well, sweetheart, uh, why don't you go to the movies?
And by the time you get back, we'll be ready to rock.
Here's 10 bucks.
And she even gives me the money.
Can you believe this?
All right, I can't wait.
This is gonna be the biggest, baddest blowout this block has ever seen.
Shake, rattle and roll.
Well, he got the rattle part right.
Boy, Deej, I'm starting to feel a little guilty about this.
Love you, sweetheart.
You should have just clubbed him.
Uh, Dad, can I talk to you about this whole dance thing?
Yeah, I wanna talk to you too.
Wait until you see your costume for the recital.
It's right here.
Okay.
What do you think?
It looks great.
Yeah, I stayed up all night sewing on the extra sequins.
I felt like Liberace's dad.
Steph, do you know your teacher thinks you're the most promising student in her class?
I might not have made it as a high jumper, but you.
You could wind up as a star on Broadway.
She's dancing She's dancing She's dancing She's dancing Just looking at her You can tell she's a winner She's Stephanie Tanner She's one ball of glamour That's me!
I'm your Broadway baby I'm the one I can dance any dance And make it second to none She taps and spins And does high kicks all over the place But through it all I still keep up The smile on my face Stephanie Tanner You're a dream come true I'm living out my childhood ambitions Through you  She's the best darn dancer On Broadway She's Stephanie Tanner That's me!
Stephanie Tanner And she's here to stay   Dad, Dad, Dad, snap out of it.
- Dad.
- Oh, right.
Sorry.
Oh, Steph, I am so glad you talked me into letting you do this dance program.
Honey, when you put your mind to something, you go all the way with it.
Now, what is it you wanted to tell me?
Uh, just that I'm ready to go.
Great, let me get my car keys and we are out of here.
She's Stephanie Tanner And she's here, ho, to, hey, stay You guys are gonna love this baby shower.
Deej, tell them how to play our first game.
Well, Becky, whoever has the bunny stamp on their rattle wins this lovely set of blue potholders.
I won.
Those are gonna go great with my checkered dish towels.
As if I care.
Beck, I'm back.
Oh, okay, everybody, get ready.
Surprise!
What the heck?
Boy, if I didn't know better, I'd say this was a baby shower.
It is a baby shower.
Isn't this a fun surprise?
Oh, yeah, this is one of my new favorite fun surprises.
I wish I had known, because I invited some friends to what I innocently thought was, like, a big major blowout, though.
Well, that's okay.
The more, the merrier.
Oh, really?
Oh, good.
Okay.
Guys, come on in.
Thank you, boys.
Hold it.
Tiny, Brain Dead, if you are gonna fight, please, no blood on the carpet.
- Oh, man.
Well.
Oh, Jess, this is all my fault.
I deserve to have my baby shower ruined.
Beck, these guys are my friends.
I put them up to it.
I've known about your scam for a week now.
You have?
I wonder who told you.
I have no idea.
Boy, am I getting sleepy.
Time for my nap.
Excuse me, boys.
Freeze, munchkin.
Did you tell Uncle Jesse our little secret?
I'm sorry, but the man had ice cream.
You bribed her with ice cream?
And chocolate fudge and whipped cream and a cherry.
Oh, that is low.
Oh, and not telling me about a baby shower, that's not low?
If I'm not in trouble, may I go back to the party?
Sure.
Go ahead.
Oh, yeah.
He had sprinkles too.
I'm sorry, Jess.
This is all my fault.
I should have never tried to trick you.
Well, I was a little sneaky with that ice-cream motif.
I got an idea.
Let's just always be honest with each other, huh?
Okay.
- So be honest.
- Uh-huh.
If I would've just asked you to go to the baby shower you would have come, right?
No.
It's a good thing you tricked me.
Okay, everybody say, "Hi, family".
Hi, family.
I'm going backstage before the big recital to meet the star herself.
And there she is.
Oh, look at that.
A dancer prepares.
Let's see if we can get a word with her.
Oh, Miss Tanner.
Dad, what are you doing back here?
As focused as she is, she still knows I'm her father.
Steph, listen to me.
I got some great news.
I am sitting next to the director of the Bayview Dance Academy.
If he likes your performance tonight we can get you into their summer dance camp.
So I'd be dancing my whole summer vacation?
- Every day?
Nothing but dancing?
- Yeah, isn't that wonderful?
They're gonna start, don't be nervous.
Just break a leg and don't be nervous.
I'm nervous enough for the both of us.
Welcome to our recital.
I'd like to remind you that bright flashes and lights are distracting to our dancers.
Tanner, you're blinding me.
Thank you.
Our first performance is our advanced modern dance group doing some street dancing to "Motownphilly".
That's my Stephanie in the middle.
She dances as well as that McHammer guy.
That's M.C. Hammer.
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.
Let's take a short intermission.
Stephanie?
What happened?
I got all messed up and I didn't know what to do so I started doing anything.
I guess I just don't have what it takes.
Honey, sit down.
Steph, you had that routine down cold.
I think you blew it on purpose.
Why would I do that?
I was wondering the same thing.
Okay.
I blew it on purpose.
But I thought this was something you really wanted.
It was.
At first.
But then, I never got to see my friends I missed the baby shower and I never got to do anything fun.
I don't wanna go to dance camp all summer.
Steph, if you wanted to quit, why didn't you just tell me?
How could I?
I begged you to let me do this.
I didn't want to let you down.
I would have understood.
Dad, you had me starring on Broadway.
And you were doing high jumps in the chorus line.
Maybe I did get a little carried away, huh?
So you're not disappointed in me?
No.
It's great to have a dream, but it's okay to change your dream too.
You don't have to dance if you don't want to.
I still wanna dance, just not all the time.
Okay, why don't we go back to the way things were before when dancing was just part of your life, instead of your whole life.
Thanks, Dad.
I love you.
Oh, I love you too.
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.
Guys, I'm really sorry I messed you up.
That's okay.
Uh, can we have another chance?
Yeah.
- Absolutely.
Are you ready?
Yeah.
- Okay.
Let's go for it!
Whoa.
Ladies and gentlemen, we'd like to try that number for you one more time.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Happy birthday to me Happy birthday to me Where is everybody?
Right here.
Happy birthday to me Is there something you'd like to say to me?
We said happy birthday to you at breakfast and everywhere else we saw you today.
But I'm 5 years old.
This is a very big day.
- Happy birthday, Michelle.
- Happy birthday, Michelle.
Don't say it if you don't mean it.
- Happy birthday, Michelle!
- Happy birthday, Michelle!
Why, thank you.
- Is it time for my party yet?
- Nope.
You still have two hours and 29 minutes to go.
How long is that?
Two Sesame Streets and a Mister Rogers.
I'll never make it.
- Oh.
- Let's start the party now.
Michelle, your little friends aren't here yet.
Who needs them?
We got cake, we got balloons, let's do it.
I know what we can do until then.
Why don't we take your official picture for your baby book?
Jess, grab the book.
Joey, set up the shot.
I'll grab the camera.
This is gonna be the best picture I ever took.
All right.
Okay, now give me a big 5-year-old smile.
Not you.
The other 5-year-old.
Cheese!
All right, Michelle.
This has everything in your entire life, starting from the day you were born.
Look, Michelle, here's your birth announcement.
And there's your hospital bracelet.
What's this?
This is your very first tube of diaper-rash cream.
I used to rub it on your little tushy.
Dad.
Sorry.
All right, this is the picture I took the day Joey and I moved in.
Remember the first time we tried to change Michelle's diaper?
Are you kidding?
I still have nightmares.
Jesse, what if she needs to be - changed?
- Check it out.
Go.
We have a winner.
- Now what?
- Joseph, put yourself in her place.
What would you want done?
I've never changed a diaper.
Me neither.
At least you touched one.
All right, look out.
I'll show you how it's done.
Come here, child.
You believe this guy?
- All right, make yourself useful.
- I'll take the south end.
Good.
- Watch out.
Okay.
- Step one, step two.
Step one, step two.
- Step one, step two.
Step one, step two.
Okay, good.
Look out.
Okay, keep her coming.
Showtime.
- Where do we put the baby?
- Where do we put the child?
Uh, the pot.
Over here.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Joey, this is a living thing.
You don't just stick it in a pot.
Use a meat rack.
I'm an idiot.
Come on.
- Okay.
All right, good.
- All right.
Great.
- Settle down here, there we go.
Are you gonna cook Michelle?
- We're changing her diaper.
- Oh, then how do you roast a turkey?
Steph, Joey and I are busy.
Joey, strip her.
All right.
Careful there.
You're in control.
- All right.
Slide it off and-- Ew!
- Ew!
Huh.
Good thinking, Joey.
Keep it fresh.
- Okay, hold her up.
I'll clean her off.
- Good idea.
Come on, Michelle.
All right.
You're missing, you're missing!
All right, come on.
Gently now, gently now, gently.
There we go.
This is great.
We should be mothers.
- Oh, yeah.
- All right, just dry her off.
Okay, fan her.
- Fan her fanny.
- Fan her fanny.
- Fan her fanny.
- Fan her fanny.
You know, these babies have it made.
I would kill for this kind of service.
All right, diapers.
- Diapers, diapers.
Where are the diapers?
- Diapers.
- Diapers, diapers, diapers.
Diapers.
Hey, superabsorbent.
Bring it over.
- Okay.
- Now what?
- Okay, spin her.
- Spin her.
- Spin her.
- Spin her.
All right, now we'll wrap her up in this.
Come on.
Put her right in here.
Here we go.
- It's too easy.
- Works for me.
- He, you spill some juice on the counter?
- Just wipe it up with Baby Tidy Bottom.
You guys were dumb.
Well, we were learning on the job.
Every time you had a first, we had a first.
Like the first time we tried to give you cough medicine.
All right, Joey, you try to give her her medicine.
I give up.
Okay, Michelle.
Here it comes.
Come on.
It tastes really good.
Watch this.
Smile.
The baby's watching you.
Mmm.
Mmm.
And she's waiting for her Uncle Jesse to swallow.
This stuff's terrible.
Remember your first workout?
- Work it out.
And go.
Okay.
- And up!
Now go!
Again!
And up!
Now breathe!
Now go!
Now go!
Now work it!
- Now go!
Feel the burn!
Now go!
Now up!
Now work it!
Now go!
- Now feel the burn!
Now go!
Now work it!
Now go!
- Now feel the burn!
Now go!
Obviously, you feel pretty secure about those chubby little legs of yours.
And we made our debut as hairstylists.
Let's give you that Marilyn Monroe look.
Kind of, bangs sweeping to the left.
Kind of, the curls framing the face, huh?
She's got the look to pull it off but I think it'd be a crime to cover that pretty little face.
See, I say we pull it back, give her a more sophisticated kind of look.
More the Madonna/Brigitte Nielsen kind of thing.
Like this.
See?
Look.
That's Jack Nicholson.
Why don't we give her kind of a Pebbles Flintstone kind of a. A fun 'do.
That's Don King.
- Maybe just a bow.
- Bow.
I remember one of your biggest discoveries.
You'll tell your sisters for me, won't you?
Ah, thank you, honey.
You take all the pressure off.
Give me a kiss.
Thanks.
All right, little munchkin, you enjoy your new bed but no more jumping up and down, okay?
- Okay, Uncle Jesse.
- All right.
Hello.
And your first punishment.
MICHELLE : This is no fun, no fun Looking at the wall Michelle?
Yes, Daddy?
Are you ready to be a good girl now?
I'll be a very good girl.
Good.
And did you learn a lesson from all of this?
Yes, I did.
No swimming in the kitchen.
Yes, no swimming in the kitchen, that's a very important lesson.
But there's a bigger lesson here.
Daddy, Uncle Jesse and Joey, we know what's best for you.
So, honey, when we ask you to do something you should do it.
- Deal?
- You're the boss.
Okay, then.
Punishment is over.
Time to play!
No, it's not.
Time for bed.
Can we watch Arsenio?
- What do you think?
- I think it's time for bed.
You think right.
It's time for bed.
To bed, I said.
Daddy?
Am I still your little princess?
Oh, you got it, dude.
I like being your little princess.
I like it too, honey.
What do you say, let's put this new picture on the very last page.
That's it.
And now, the Michelle Tanner baby book has come to an end.
That's it?
I'm finished?
Well, you're not finished.
Just your book is.
Are you gonna start a new book?
Well, in a few weeks when we have twins we're gonna make a new book for them.
Yeah.
That's gonna be fun.
Another book.
I don't want my book to be finished.
I wanna be the little princess.
Forget my birthday.
I'm staying 4 years old.
Michelle?
- Michelle.
Baby.
D.J.: Where are you?
Michelle?
- Michelle?
- Hmm, I wonder where Michelle could be.
You found me.
Big deal.
Okay, sweetie, move over.
Michelle, you have to know, no matter how old you get you're always gonna be my little princess.
Just like Stephanie's always gonna be my little ladybug.
And D.J. is always gonna be my little tennis-ball head.
Somebody wanna trade?
I like being the baby.
I'm good at it.
Oh, shorty, you're not special because you're a baby.
You're special because you're you.
I ought to know, because you and I go way back.
We've had a lot of cool times together, haven't we?
Sing this:  I got you, babe Sing it.
I got babe That settles it.
You be Sonny.
Sing it again.
I got you, babe I want a babe She's back, and she's cooler than ever.
Yo, hot wheels!
Remember when I almost moved out?
I'm gonna miss you.
I'm gonna miss you too, pal.
But we have to put on our bravest face now, okay?
We've gotta be really brave about this thing.
So let me see your brave face.
Can you smile for me?
Thattagirl.
All right, now that we've got this bravery thing give me the biggest, most gigantic, most greatest hug you ever gave me.
Ready?
And go!
Hug, hug, hug.
Ah, thattagirl.
This is a goodbye present.
Michelle, that's your pig.
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure.
Well, in that case, here.
I want you to have this.
This is my pink bunny.
I want you to put it up on the wall.
And whenever you look at it, you can think of me, okay?
You got it, dude.
- Goodbye, Michelle.
- Goodbye, Uncle Jesse.
You see, Michelle, I could never leave you because you're my special pal.
- And I love having you for a little sister.
- Yeah, me too.
We've had a lot of laughs.
You wouldn't believe the things I got you to do.
I don't care what's in the bag.
No!
I shouldn't do it, should I, Michelle?
What if?
Look, Michelle.
I've got a cookie.
Yeah, you want the cookie?
They're yummy.
Want some cookie?
Yeah.
Come get the yummy cookie.
Oops!
The cookie accidentally jumped into the bag.
Go find it!
Unzip the bag, Michelle.
Let's see what's in there.
Never mind the cookie.
Get the zipper open.
Let's see what Uncle Jesse's hiding in there.
You found it!
- May I help you?
- She did it.
Shame on you, Michelle.
D.J.: And you learned a few tricks.
You can be my dog.
I'll call you Peanut.
D.J.: Michelle?
Go hide on the bed.
But no barking.
Hey, Michelle, have you seen Sparky?
No Sparky here.
Have a nice day.
Did that bunny rabbit just bark?
That was me.
Maybe it's a doggie.
D.J.: But if we really needed you, you were always there.
- Leave the shirt alone.
- No.
Leave it alone!
You're in big trouble, mister.
I'm gonna go upstairs and see if your sisters are up there.
They're not doing anything wrong.
Well, that pretty much means they are, doesn't it?
You cannot go upstairs.
Oh, yes, I can.
He's coming!
He's coming!
He's coming!
He's coming!
He's coming!
He's coming!
He's coming!
He's coming!
He's coming!
D.J.: Hurry, he's coming.
Hurry.
He's coming!
He's coming!
He's coming!
He's coming!
He's here.
I did the best I could.
Kimmy, how could you do that?
!
It's not polite to yell.
Michelle, I have enough problems without the Polite Police on my tail so just stay out of this.
You forgot to say please.
That's it.
This is not polite.
This is not polite.
This is not polite.
This is not polite.
Thank you.
You are not welcome!
May I have that cupcake, please?
No, you may not.
But I was polite and I said please.
I was polite too.
I said, no, you may not.
Guess what.
Politeness Week is over!
How rude!
You are a piece of work.
Thank you.
I think.
What Stephanie's trying to say is you're a really cool young lady.
If you got any more stories about me, I wanna hear them.
All right, a nickel.
All right, a Cheeto.
Ice-cream man.
Ice-cream man.
Ice-cream man.
Wait for me, I got money.
Give me back my money, you pig.
Why are you very mad?
Uncle Jesse locked me out.
Now, why would Uncle Jesse do something like that?
I don't know.
I'm a fun girl.
I'm just guessing, but I think Uncle Jesse and Aunt Becky just want some privacy.
What is privacy?
Well, privacy means that they just want to spend some time together.
- Just the two of them.
- What are they doing in there?
Well, they're doing their taxes.
Are they going to do their taxes every night?
For the first couple of months.
I'm Popeye the sailor man I'm Popeye the sailor man I'm strong to the finish 'Cause I eats me spinach  I'm Popeye the sailor man Toot, toot.

And the older you get, the cooler you're gonna be.
But you gotta keep growing up.
So are you ready to turn 5 now?
Yes, I am.
It's party time!
Not so fast.
You still have two hours and 13 minutes to go.
This is the longest day of my life.
Okay, party animals.
We've got some more decorating to do.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Okay, kids, are we ready to start Michelle's fifth birthday party?
Yeah!
Wait a minute.
This is a Flintstones caveman party.
Cave people never say, "Yay".
They say, "Ooga, ooga".
How do you know they said, "Ooga, ooga"?
Because I'm Wilma Flintstone.
I was there.
Now, if we all say, "Ooga, ooga," I bet we can get the rest of my Bedrock buddies to show up.
Ooga, ooga!
Yeah, ooga ooga, everybody.
Hi, I'm Barney.
This is Betty.
We're the Rubbles.
And now, to meet the world's only housebroken dinosaur, Dino!
What kind of dinosaur are you?
I'm a tidy-o-saurus.
Please, kids, whatever you do, keep the cave floor clean.
Wilma!
Could you give me a hand picking up these crumbs?
My arms haven't evolved yet.
Ooga ooga, Dino.
You know, Dad, the kids love all the props you got to borrow from the station.
Deej, it was real sweet of you to dress up and play along like this.
Well, just remember, when I get my driver's license I have two words for you: red Porsche.
And I have two words for you: bus pass.
All right, all right, cave kids it's time to bring out our favorite 5-year-old cave babe Michelle "Pebbles" Tanner.
Ooga ooga!
Ooga!
Ooga!
This is Comet, my pet stegosaurus.
That's not a stegosaurus, that's a golden retriever.
You got a bad attitude.
Hey, we're missing somebody.
How can we be a modern stone-age family without Fred Flintstone?
I wouldn't do this for anyone but Michelle.
Wilma!
I'm not Wilma.
Just practicing.
Jess, I think it's time.
I know, put on your costume.
You're gonna make a great preg-o- saurus.
I'm gonna get my club.
No, I mean, I think it's time to have the babies.
- No.
- I think so.
- Get out of here.
- I really do.
- No.
- I think so.
Get out of here.
Jess, get a grip.
It's happening.
You know that indigestion I've been having?
From Joey's Cocoa Puff omelets.
I got it too.
Yeah, my pangs of indigestion are now coming 10 minutes apart.
So are mine.
Jess, it's not indigestion.
I know it's three weeks early, but I'm going into labor.
What am I going into?
I don't know.
Maybe you're having sympathy pains.
No, honey, this is impossible.
We're not ready to have the kids.
I didn't finish the nursery, pick out the names, practice the drill.
So you can't possibly be going into labor because I'm not ready yet.
Well, ready or not, here they come.
- No.
- Yes.
- Get out of here.
- Jess, we've already played this game.
Now, come on, I am ready to have our babies.
Have mercy!
Oh, honey, we gotta get to the hospital.
Hey-- See, I'm gonna be cool.
I'm not gonna be like those husbands who get all crazy and go nuts because their wife's in labor.
I'm calm, cool and collected because, hey, babe, I'm there for you.
I'll pack.
Ready.
Here, grab an end.
Honey, we're having a baby, not going to Europe.
Oh, you're right, we gotta lose something.
All right, which do you like better the blue silk or, say, the black rhinestone?
For childbirth?
The blue silk.
See, that's what I would've gone for, the blue silk.
Jess, I've been packed for six months, so let's just go.
- Come on, let's go.
Here we go.
- Okay.
Kids, that's enough.
That's enough.
We've had a lot of fun, haven't we?
I'm losing my balance, kids.
Kids.
That's enough, I mean it.
Okay, okay.
Clubs down there, kids.
Sorry, Dino boy.
I guess having a dinosaur hunt wasn't such a hot idea after all.
Everybody, this is it.
Becky's ready to have the twins.
No.
- Really?
- Get out of here.
Don't start that again.
It's true.
I'm gonna have the babies.
At my party?
This is better than Chuck E. Cheese.
Let's go, gotta get to the hospital.
Carry this.
Girls, help your Aunt Becky out.
- Hey, look, a dorkasaurus.
Out of the way, Kimmy.
Let's go.
Come on, you guys.
D.J.: Becky's having her twins.
Oh, I can help.
My hamster just had triplets.
There's nobody here but us kids?
That could never happen.
It's true, we're home alone.
Let's eat birthday cake!
Wait!
First, I need to make a wish and blow out the candles.
Is anybody allowed to play with matches?
No.
Me neither.
I'll have to pretend.
Enough already.
Cut the cake.
Is anybody allowed to use a knife?
No.
I'll cut the cake.
I take karate.
Hi-ya!
Let's pig out!
Oh, no, we're too late.
Sorry, Michelle, in all the new-baby excitement I completely forgot about you and your friends.
That's okay.
Have some cake.
We'll have some cake.
All right, clear the path.
Woman in labor here.
Move, move, move it!
Jess, why don't you just stick a sign on my back that says "wide load"?
You're three weeks early.
Didn't have time to make it.
We need a wheelchair.
We need a wheelchair, please-- Hey, look at that, Doogie Howser.
Excuse me.
Here we go, sit down here in a wheelchair.
Forgive him, he's basically lost it.
All right.
Hey, excuse me.
Pardon me, we need some service here.
Well, how long have you been walking erect?
Very funny.
Look, I'm having twins here.
I need service, can you call a bellhop or something?
Would you like a poolside room or an ocean view?
Honey, would you like a poolside room or an ocean view?
Jess, she was kidding.
I knew that.
Fill out these forms-- I mean, would you care to register?
Sorry I'm late.
I had a little trouble getting my tail through the revolving door.
Mr. T people are staring.
Lose the lizard suit.
Why should I?
I look fabulous in lavender.
And I'm really into this character.
The truth is, I'm not wearing any pants.
You're not wearing any pants?
Gross!
Kimmy, do me a favor.
Call home and tell them everything's okay.
- You got a quarter?
- Where would I keep it?
Just call collect, and tell them to please bring some pants.
Right.
Bring pants because he's not wearing any.
Would Puff the Magic Dragon like a hospital gown?
Actually, I'd love one.
And the name is Dino.
Come with me.
NURSE : Dr. Cartwright, call the nurses' station.
- Hi, Rebecca.
- Oh, hi, doctor.
Your birthing room's all ready.
How are you doing?
Fine.
Contractions are seven minutes apart.
- Good.
- Mine are every time I breathe.
- What do you mean?
- She says I'm having sympathy pains.
But would I have them right around this black spot?
Mind if I take a look?
Ow!
Jesse, I'm afraid you may need to have your appendix out.
Now?
Mm-hmm.
What?
No, I can't have my appendix taken out, I'm going into labor.
I want you to see Dr. Larkin in Emergency right away.
Orderly, I need a wheelchair.
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm staying here with my wife.
That's very sweet, but you're gonna do what the doctor says.
How serious is this?
It's fairly routine, but it's something we need to take care of now.
- Have a seat, Jesse.
- I don't believe this.
- Jess, what's going on?
Are you okay?
- Oh, sure.
I'm fine.
Just figured, heck, while I'm here, might as well have my appendix taken out.
Can't you just let Becky have the babies?
- You are so competitive.
- You think I wanted this to happen now?
Doctor, if I have to go into surgery, am I gonna be back in time to help my wife?
There's no way to know.
You need to sit down.
Danny, listen.
If I don't make it out in time, can you help coach Becky through the childbirth?
Jess, no problem.
I've been through this three times before.
I can do this with one hand behind my back.
Which I may do to keep this gown closed.
Beck, I'll be back as soon as possible.
Now, try to wait as long as you can to have the twins.
I'll do my best.
I'm sorry, Beck.
There's no place in the world I'd rather be than right here with you.
I love you.
I love you too.
Hurry back, honey.
Wait for me.
Nice buns.
Yes, I know you just dropped your son off but it's amazing at how much birthday fun you can cram into 15 minutes.
Uh-huh.
Okay, bye.
Okay, kids, your parents are on their way to pick you up.
We have to get to the hospital before the babies are born so let's wait for them out on the porch.
Move it, people.
The party's over.
But you never opened your presents.
Hold it, people.
The party's back on.
Okay, kids, we're gonna play a new game now.
It's called Open the Present You Brought as Fast as You Can.
How do you play?
Well, you open the present you brought as fast as you can, hence the name: "Open the Present You Brought as Fast as You Can".
I think I get it now.
Okay, everybody get in a straight line.
All right.
Now, ready, get set open the present you brought as fast as you can.
All right, there we are, we're opening we're having a great time.
Oh, good, look how fast this guy's going.
Oh, good, it looks beautiful.
That's it, great.
Those are some beautiful presents.
Now, hold them out so Michelle can see what she got.
Love it, love it, love it.
Like it, love it, like it, love it.
That looked bigger on TV.
And that officially ends the party.
Please place your presents gently on the floor and proceed to the nearest exit.
Okay, that would be this way.
Have a nice day and don't forget, buckle up.
Come on.
Thanks for the presents and thanks for coming.
This was a strange party.
Sing it.
I'm sorry.
Becky, just keep breathing, okay?
We're almost through this one.
Okay, the main thing is not to think about the pain.
There is no pain.
Pain is not part of their vocabulary.
Pain does not exist.
Danny, do you think you could say the word "pain" just a few more times?
Sorry, I'm just trying to help keep your mind off that not-so-great feeling.
Are you ready for us?
Come on in, everybody.
Did you have the twins yet?
- No, not yet.
- What's taking them so long?
Maybe they can't decide who should come out first.
Well, it could take a while.
According to my biology teacher, a woman can be in labor for days.
Where's Jess?
It turned out his stomachache was really appendicitis.
- Is he gonna be all right?
- I'm sure he's gonna be fine.
- He just has to have an appendectomy.
- Appen-what?
Well, boys and girls, in scientific terms an appendectomy is when they take that thingamajig out of your tum-tum that you really don't need need.
Hey, everybody, great news.
Kimmy, is Jesse okay?
I don't know.
I got lost.
But I did find Luc this really cute guy with two broken arms.
So I volunteered to spoon-feed him his Jell-O.
Is Uncle Jesse gonna miss the babies being born?
Oh, I hope not.
I really want him to be here.
Don't worry, Beck, because either way, he's gonna get to see the birth.
Excuse me.
All right.
Come on in, guys.
Danny, what is this?
Becky, it's your own camera crew.
You know Mark and Eppie.
I know who they are.
What are they doing in my room?
Remember when you announced you were pregnant on Wake Up, San Francisco?
You promised our viewers we'd get to see the whole thing on tape.
Yeah, well, that's when I was thin, my hair was done, and I wasn't sweating.
That's not sweat, that's a mother's glow.
Come on, let's do a quick little intro before your next contraction, huh?
- Danny, I am not gonna do this.
- We're rolling.
Hi, I'm Rebecca Donaldson, and I'm in labor.
And I am Danny Tanner, and right now, we are in Rebecca's very hospital room where she's about to give birth to twins.
I'm gonna be here every second coaching Becky and giving you the play-by-play as we all watch in amazement the miracle of life.
Well, Danny, about that miracle.
It's kind of a private thing that I'll be happy to talk about when I return to the show in a few weeks.
But until then, this is Rebecca Donaldson saying get out of my room.
And cut.
You're doing great, Rebecca.
It's not gonna be long now.
Oh, I wish Jesse were here with me.
Okay.
That one's over.
Oh, man, that was the toughest contraction yet.
Gee, Danny, maybe you should lie down.
No, Becky, I've made it this far.
I'm gonna go all the way.
Sponge.
Thanks.
- Jesse's out of surgery.
- Is he okay?
Surgery went fine.
Oh, Jess, you made it just when I need you.
This is a pretty room.
He's still a little groggy from the anesthesia.
Jess, I just want you to know you should be really proud of Becky.
She's doing a really great job.
Hey, I know you.
You're-- - Danny.
- No, that's not it.
You guys need us for anything else?
No, we'll take it from here, thanks.
Hey, you've been a really great coach, thanks.
Anytime.
Thank you, Donny.
Close enough.
Oh, honey, I'm so glad you made it in time.
In time for what?
The birth of our babies.
Oh, that's right.
You're having my baby.
Jess, just hold my hand.
Won't your husband, Donny, be jealous?
Jess, you're my husband.
I get a wife and a baby in the same day.
Radical.
Okay, Rebecca, here comes another contraction.
- We're gonna push on this one.
- Okay.
Get ready, deep breath and push.
Whoa!
Whoa!
Good girl.
Six.
Good girl.
Five.
Four, three.
Come on.
Come on, you're doing great, I can see the head!
Come on, Rebecca!
- Whoa!
- Shut up!
Beck, I'm so proud of you.
Look what we brought into this world.
Thank you for giving me two beautiful, healthy little boys.
Look at him smile.
- I love you.
- I love you too.
And thank you for making this the happiest day of my life.
I can't believe it.
I'm the father of two identical twin sons.
Hey.
Hey, bub, I'm your daddy.
And I'm your mommy.
Hi.
Becky, can you believe it?
We're parents.
How are we doing so far, Dad?
I think they dig us.
Look at this, they got your little nose.
And they have your cute smile.
How did they end up with Fred Mertz's hair?
- You guys feel up for some visitors?
- Sure, come on in.
Come on, everybody.
- Hi, family.
- Hi, family.
- Hi, everybody.
- Hi, everybody.
Hi, little baby boys.
My name is Joey, and I'm gonna teach you how to do archery, bowling, hockey, racecars-- Joey, they just learned to open their eyes.
Okay, then we'll just play peekaboo.
And, guys, I'm your Uncle Danny.
I don't do any funny voices but thanks to me, your diapers are gonna smell April fresh.
What are their names?
Well, we each got to pick a name.
So I picked Alexander, after my high school teacher who gave me the inspiration to go into journalism.
And I picked Nicholas after my father, who gave me great hair.
You hear that, baldy?
Grow, grow.
Which one is which?
We don't know yet.
All right.
All right, who wants to be Alexander?
We have a volunteer.
They look exactly alike.
How are you gonna tell them apart?
You could put a drop of red nail polish on one of their backs.
That's what I did with my turtles.
Your babies are very cute.
You get two thumbs up.
Thank you, Michelle.
They're so little.
They could wear my dolls' clothes.
Hey, back off, shorty.
They're boys.
Michelle, we're really sorry you had to cut your birthday party short.
It's cool.
Michelle, just think, now you get to share your birthday with the twins.
- That means triple birthdays.
- Is that a good thing?
Well, you get three birthday cakes.
That's a very good thing.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
You wanna help me make breakfast, Michelle?
Sure, I can smash some eggs.
Whoa, you don't smash them.
You crack them on the side of the bowl very gently.
Observe.
Now, do you think you can do that?
Duh.
Michelle, that was perfect.
Thank you very much.
Now, would you like to scramble them up?
I sure would.
Okay, that's it.
I just saw Jesse and Becky pull up.
They're home from the hospital with the twins.
Oh, man.
I hear footsteps.
Are you ready?
Welcome home.
Well, I can feel the love.
- We're home.
- Hi.
Look at this.
Nicky, Alexander, this is your family, remember?
Oh, isn't that cute?
They look like little Elmer Fudds.
Hello, you rascally rug rats.
Joey's right.
My babies look like Elmer Fudd.
Honey, honey, it's okay.
Joey wasn't thinking.
You know how he has trouble with that.
Now, everybody, we have to be a little sensitive to Becky's feelings.
Doctor said she'll be a little over-emotional the next few days.
Well, it's not my fault.
The doctor said it's very common for new mothers to have mood swings.
Why are you all staring at me?
Because you were just talking to us.
Oh, well, thanks for listening.
- Is that a mood swing?
- Six-point-two.
- Can I hold one of the babies?
Sure.
- Can I hold one too?
- Absolutely, Steph.
- But you have to sit down first, okay?
Okay.
- Hey, bub.
Hey, bubba.
- Come here, baby.
- Hey, come on, pal.
Here we go.
It's okay.
- It's okay.
Okay.
All right, here we go, Deej.
- Be careful with his head.
D.J.: Okay.
Oh, how sweet.
- I'm next.
- I'm afraid you're too little.
In case you forgot, I'm 5 years old now.
That's a whole hand.
Michelle, babies are very delicate.
I'm sorry, you're just not old enough yet.
The twins are so cute.
Let me tell everyone, let's not get in the habit of calling them "the twins".
They're two entirely different people with two entirely different identities.
So which one's Nicky and which one's Alexander?
Beats me.
But I do know Nicky loves Elvis.
And Alex loves to burp.
But their names are on their hospital bracelets.
Hey, Kimmy, get the camera.
Grandparents are gonna want pictures.
Wait a minute.
If my mom's gonna see this I have to put on the booties that she made for the boys.
Hold it a second.
No sons of mine are gonna be wearing any tutti-frutti booties, all right?
I knew it.
You hate my mother, don't you?
No, I-- Mood swing.
No, I-- I love your sainted mother.
Did I--?
Did I say tutti-frutti booties?
No, I meant-- I meant cutie-wootie booties is what I meant.
You're just saying that.
No, no, no.
They're adorable.
Aren't they adorable?
Help me out here, please.
- I'd wear them.
They're cute.
- See?
- Oh.
Well, I'm so glad you like them.
All right.
This is where your mommy and daddy live, huh?
And this is the bed.
That's where you guys got started.
- Jess.
- It's the highlight of the tour.
Okay, here's the rest of the room, fellas.
What do you think?
- Honey, I'm gonna unpack.
- Okay.
All right.
And in here, this is your room.
This is the nursery, huh?
Fellas, what do you think?
I know what you're saying, you're saying, "Hey, Pop, we deserve walls".
And I promise, some day you'll get them.
All right.
Oh, this is gonna be the perfect place, guys.
And you're gonna have the perfect life because I'm gonna be the perfect dad.
I mean, my dad was great, but he did make a few mistakes like he was always bugging me about my long hair.
Let me tell you guys, it's not gonna happen to you.
You know why?
Because you're bald.
I was just kidding.
I'm kidding.
I'm do-- You know, I like to joke around sometimes, you guys will learn.
Oh, I love you so much.
Can I have a kiss?
Can I have a little kiss?
I'm gonna be the best dad in the world.
I promise you guys.
Oh, this is so fun.
I'm hanging out with my boys, my boys.
High-five.
Give me a high-five.
Give me a high-five.
Give me a high-five.
Give me a high-five.
Give me a high-five.
High-five, high-five me.
Right on, brother.
So the doctor's taking my blood pressure and you're not gonna believe this, it registers nothing.
It turns out there was this hole in that little squeeze ball.
You know, that thing that looks like a turkey baster.
What, we're out of time already?
I can't believe this.
Boy, time sure flies when I'm telling stories, doesn't it?
Tune in tomorrow when my guests will be Chef Sol Wong and cartoon-show host Ranger Joe Gladstone.
Becky, enjoy your babies.
Don't worry, the show's in good hands.
- So long, San Francisco.
SINGERS : Wake up!
Well, pretty good show, huh, Mr. Strowbridge?
- You need a cohost.
- A cohost?
Yeah.
Someone to complement you.
Why?
I compliment myself all the time.
Watch this.
Good show, nice work, Danny.
Tanner, I'm sure you're gonna really like Vicky Larson.
She's starting tomorrow.
Oh, Vicky, come.
- She's starting tomorrow?
- Hi.
Tomorrow works for me.
Hi there.
I'm-- I'm Danny Tanner.
Welcome to my world.
- Well, it's nice to meet you, Danny.
- All right, you two, so talk, mingle.
Make chemistry.
So have you ever done a morning talk show before?
Well, no, but that doesn't mean that I haven't-- Well, don't you worry about a thing.
I am gonna teach you everything I know.
For instance, words like "speaking of" can smoothly get you from one subject to another.
That's what we people in the talk-show biz call a segue.
- Segue, I think I got it.
- Vicky, they want you in wardrobe.
I guess I'll see you tomorrow.
Oh, "I'll see you tomorrow".
That's an excellent way to end a show.
Oh, boy, you're catching on already.
There, now doesn't that feel much better without those hospital bracelets?
- You're allowed to take them off?
- Well, it's not like they're mattress tags.
But how do you tell them apart?
Oh, it's easy.
Nicky is in the mint-green booties, yes.
And Alex is in the peach ones.
Hi, sweetie.
Listen, will you girls do me a favor and entertain the boys while I put these bracelets in their baby books?
- Sure.
- Now, don't you guys dare do anything cute while I'm gone, okay?
Okay, let's play with them.
I'll take Alexander, you take Nicky.
- Hi, Alexander.
Hi, buddy.
- Hi, Nicky.
Peekaboo.
- Hi, hi, hi, you're a cutie.
- Peekaboo, peekaboo.
Okay, switch.
- Hi, Nicky.
Hi.
- Hi, little buddy.
Hi, hi.
Okay, Daddy's back.
Come on, D.J., let's put the laundry away.
Won't that be fun?
Steph, it's me.
Sorry.
I'm better now.
Hi, bub, hey.
I'm older now.
Want me to hold anything?
Oh, no thanks, Michelle.
You-- You run along and play, okay?
That what I always do.
Play, play, play.
What?
What was that?
Oh, you want me to take off those girly booties?
Hey, guys, I-- I don't blame you.
They're out of here.
There we go.
Now we can go back to being real men.
This little piggy went to market.
This little piggy rode his Harley-Davidson.
- This little-- - Oh, Jess, Alexander needs to be nursed.
- Wanna bring him in the other room?
- Sure.
- Thanks.
- Okay, Alexander needs to be nursed.
Where'd your bracelets go?
Hey, Beck?
You guys, wait here.
Stay out of the fridge.
Beck, what happened to the babies' bracelets?
I took them off and put them in their baby books.
- How are we gonna tell them apart?
- Oh, it's simple.
Alexander's in the peach booties, and Nicky's in the mint-green ones.
Listen, about these booties.
I really think they're a little girly for me.
Jess, my mother made those booties, and I want my sons to wear them.
And I don't think that's too much to ask.
- Why are you putting me through this?
- I'm sorry.
I'm wrong.
No, I-- I love those boot-- Any good red-blooded American boy would love to wear those booties.
In fact, could you call your mother up and ask if she can make a pair for me?
- Oh, I bet she would.
- Yeah.
- Now, please go bring me Alexander.
- Okay.
Thank you.
Guys, we gotta put your booties back on.
Why?
Because your mom's about this far from losing it.
Okay, Alexander, you have the peach motif.
Which--?
Who's Alexander?
Which one of you is Alexa--?
Whoever's Alexander, raise your hand.
Anyone?
Anyone?
Oh, my God, I don't know who's who.
I mixed up my own kids.
Some father.
I can just hear it now.
You telling your shrink: "Oh, we were fine, till my old man took off my booties.
I almost spent the rest of my life not knowing if I was me or my brother".
- Jess?

Listen, I gotta find out who is who now.
Now, Nicky, whoever you are, I know you love Elvis.
So give me some kind of sign, okay?
Ready?
I'm just a hunk of, hunk of burning love.
I'm just a hunk of, hunk of burning love.
Come on, guys.
Do something.
Curl a lip.
Anything.
- Morning, Jess.
- Oh, hi.
Morning.
- Are the babies awake?
- Yeah, yeah, they're awake.
Happy, healthy, confident in knowing who they are.
Oh, honey, look.
Nicky burped.
Oh.
- I thought Big Al was the king of burps.
- Hey, you.
You better watch out.
Nicky's making a run for the crown.
Yes, he is.
Yeah, he's making a run for the crown now.
Aha.
All right, you little gas bag, you must be Big Al.
Okay, what we're gonna do is we switch.
We'll switch the booties.
Shake, shake, shake Shake, shake, shake Shake your booties Everybody sing along.
Shake your booty You guys don't know the song.
That's right.
You missed the '70s.
Lucky you.
Shake, shake, shake Shake, shake, shake Shake your-- Now we're all set.
There we go.
Wait a minute.
Becky saw you guys the other way around.
Well, all right, we'll just.
Here.
I got it.
We simply do this.
We do this.
Ready?
Bada bing, bada boom.
And you thought your old man was a dope.
All right.
Okay.
Now you burped.
Guys, you're messing me up here.
I can't be changing your booties for 18 more years.
Hi, Dad.
- Hi, Mom.
- How you doing?
Fine, fine.
You know, I was thinking.
Wouldn't it be funny if we accidentally mixed up the kids and we really didn't know who was who?
Funny?
That would be horrible.
I mean, that would be a tragedy.
I mean, they'd go through life never knowing their true identities.
And that's why I will never let that happen.
Okay, I'm another day older.
Could I hold the babies now?
Jess, I have a feeling she's never gonna give up on this.
I think you're right.
Okay, Michelle, sit down, I'll grab you a kid.
All right, you sit back up in there, okay?
Now, remember, you gotta keep your hand behind his head.
And don't jostle him and don't drop him and-- Pretty much don't even move a muscle.
You're making me very nervous.
Sorry.
Here you go.
- All right.
There he is.
Oh, hi, sweetie.
Look at me.
I'm holding a baby.
Look how happy he is, Michelle.
That's because he likes me.
He's your little cousin.
He looks up to you.
If you have any questions, talk to me.
I love you.
- All right, you two, have a good show.
- Thanks, Mr. Strowbridge.
Vicky, these are for you.
That's very sweet, Bill.
Now, Vicky, give us some of that Emmy-award-winning style.
You, uh--?
You won an Emmy?
Well, actually, I won two of them in D.C. for investigative reporting.
I-- I thought you said you never did a talk show before?
That's true, but I anchored the evening news for five years.
Why didn't you, uh, tell me that?
Because you never stop talking.
In five, four, three, two.
SINGERS : Wake up!
Wake up, San Francisco.
Hi, I'm Danny Tanner.
And temporarily filling in for my cohost, Rebecca "Hurry back soon" Donaldson is Vicky Larson.
Actually, it's Vicky "I'm gonna be here for four weeks so let's have a good time" Larson.
Okay.
Well, let's bring out our first guest, shall we?
He is the host of The Ranger Joe Cartoon Show.
Let's hear it for my good friend, Joey Gladstone.
SINGERS : Ranger Joe, Ranger Joe  He's the greatest guy I know  He's Ranger Joe - Hey, Joey.
Hi, Danny.
- Hi.
- Vicky.
- Welcome to the show.
Thank you.
- Welcome to the show, Mr. Woodchuck.
Thanks, Danny.
I'll just watch.
Well, Joey is hosting the cartoon marathon all this week.
Speaking of cartoons.
Like that segue, Danny?
Not bad.
Joey, do you feel that violence in cartoons today has an adverse effect on our children's social consciousness?
- Well, actually, Vicky-- - Excuse me.
Vicky, please Joey is just a sweet, lovable, goofy guy.
Please don't try and clog his head with these kind of controversial issues.
Actually, Vicky I'm glad that I finally have the chance to articulate my position.
Articulate?
Yes, I've given this issue a lot of thought and while violence is certainly endemic to our society on my show, I only run cartoons where the violence is non-reality based.
That is to say, if we see a mouse drop a battleship on a cat the emulation of that act by a small child would be virtually impossible.
That's a fascinating observation.
Yeah, especially coming from a man who plays "Jingle Bells" on his armpits.
We'll be right back with more of Ranger Joe, Ph.D. - And we're clear.
Great interview, Joey.
Oh, thanks, Vicky.
You know, you are really wonderful.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
What do--?
What do you mean, she's wonderful?
She's overbearing, abrasive and arrogant.
Man, you are so hot for her.
I know.
She's gonna drive me nuts.
- Okay.
Ready for round two?
- Yep, let's get it on.
I mean, let's get on with it, the show.
Hi, we're back.
And we're talking with cartoon-show host.
Here you go, Uncle Jesse.
My junior-detective kit.
Shh.
Keep your voice down.
- Why?
What do you need this for?
- I can't tell you.
Then I can't let you use it.
All right, girls, I'm gonna tell you a secret.
But you can't tell Becky because, well, you know how she's been.
- Nuts?
- She hasn't been nuts, she's-- Yeah, nuts.
Yeah, she's been nuts.
What happened was I mixed the twins up and I can't tell who's who.
What?
They're your own kids.
Even baboons know their own babies.
Out!
Ooh.
Sore spot.
All right, this is what we do.
What I'll do is take a footprint of one of the babies.
And I'll compare it to the original birth certificate right here, okay?
Deej, get the ink out.
I'll take, uh.
Whoever you are.
Come on.
Alrighty.
Here we go.
Here we go.
Okay, ready?
And ink him.
Son, this better be your last set of prints.
Okay.
And do this.
Look at that.
See?
All right, now we just compare it with the original and we'll be jake.
Hey, where is everybody?
We're in here!
- Shh, Stephanie.
- No, we're not!
Look at this.
Becky's gonna see this.
D.J., help me here.
Let's put his foot in my pocket.
Oh, here you are.
Jess, it's time to feed the boys.
Uh, I think I hear Dad calling.
Coming, Dad.
Dad's at the store.
You are really having a bad day.
Jess, is--?
Is there some reason that our son's foot is in your pocket?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Well, there's-- There's-- There's a perfectly good reason.
And-- And that is because.
Well-- Well, because he kicked his booty off and-- And he-- And I wanted to keep his foot warm.
There-- There you go.
There's a-- There's a perfectly good reason.
Is there a perfectly good reason that his foot is covered with ink?
Where is my head today?
I-- I must have left another inkpad in my pocket.
Why don't you tell me the truth?
Well, the truth is, I was taking his footprints because I took their booties off, and now I can't tell them apart.
I'm some great dad, huh?
Even baboons can tell their kids apart.
Honey, why didn't you tell me?
Well, I was just trying to avoid the mother of all mood swings.
I know I've been a little crazy, but if there's some problem with our kids you have to tell me so we can work it out together.
I know, I just-- I just wanna be the perfect dad, that's all.
There is no such thing as the perfect dad.
But you're going to be a great dad, and you're already a great husband.
And I love you.
Have mercy.
Well, we're doing pretty good so far.
I mean, our kids are happy, they're healthy we just don't know who the heck they are.
But I'm gonna find out right now, all right?
Now, let's see.
This one.
See, it's got a little squiggle here and a little squigg-- We have a match.
You-- You with the inky foot, my friend, are Big Al.
Isn't that great news, guys?
They're so excited, they're speechless.
Guys, I've been going crazy all day.
I found out who you are.
You're Al, you're Nicky.
High-five.
Give me high-fives.
High-five.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
- Good morning, everyone.
Good morning.
Hey, it's Jesse, remember him?
Jess, we've barely seen you since the twins were born.
How's it going, Dad?
Oh, it's going fine.
And it's not Dad, it's Mighty Dad.
I stayed up all night, finished the nursery.
I gotta sweep up the sawdust.
Take the kids' clothes, fold them.
And I got just enough time for a nutritious breakfast.
Lay some doughnuts on me.
There you go.
And we thank you.
Oh, my ride's here.
Come in, Mighty Dad.
Yeah.
Read you loud and clear, Mighty Momma.
We have a situation in the attic.
You need a backup?
Affirmative.
We've got a number two in progress from twin number one.
Ten-four on number one's number two, over and out.
Girls, I'd like you to say hi to Vicky Larson.
She's filling in for Becky on my show.
D.J.: Hi.
Hi.
Daddy, you're right, she is a pretty girl.
Why, thank you, Danny.
Hey, Daddy, are you gonna ask her on a date?
Michelle, where would you get an idea like that?
From Stephanie.
I heard it from D.J. I heard it from Joey.
I heard it from Danny.
You see how these crazy rumors get started?
Girls, I'm sure that Vicky feels that you don't mix business with pleasure.
- Well, yes, I do feel that way.
- Great, it will work out perfect.
I won't ask you out, and you won't say no.
Hey, you guys, you'll never guess who Bay City Magazine picked as Bachelor of the Month.
Thank God he left his clothes on.
Thank you, Kimmy.
Oh, wow.
What a surprise.
I-- I don't know what to say.
You could say three years of sending in your picture finally paid off.
Vicky, I hope you don't think I did this just as an easy way to meet women.
Oh, of course not, you probably did it to get publicity for the show.
Absolutely.
Having a lot of strange women chasing after me boy, that's-- That's the last thing I want.
Hi, does the Bachelor of the Month live here?
Yes, he does, but you're the last thing he wants.
Hey.
No-- Hi, sorry about that door in your face.
Come on in, I'm Danny Tanner.
No problem.
I'm Penny Allen.
I just jogged over from down the street and across the Bay Bridge.
If you're not busy, can I take you out to dinner tonight?
Sure.
We can talk about it on the show.
That will be fascinating.
Great, I'll pick you up at 7.
- Well, I gotta run.
Bye-bye.
- Bye.
Well.
What do you know?
I, uh.
I got myself a date tonight.
But what about my bedtime story?
We'll fill in for Dad.
Yeah, how often does Dad have a date anyway?
Not very often.
All right, Nicky, Alex, you're about to take your very first look at your brand-new nursery, huh?
Come, guys, come with us.
Ooh.
- Hey.
What do you guys think?
I can feel the excitement.
Look at this.
Look, look, look.
I got you an Elvis mobile, huh?
Watch this, they're all shook up, see?
I just hope they can sleep with the glare from those sequined jump suits.
It will be okay.
All right, what's next, Mighty Momma?
Diaper check, Mighty Dad.
Here we go.
Up we go.
Ah, fresh as a daisy.
Oh, I got the fertilizer.
Let me ask you guys a question here.
Now, every time you're wet, you're dry.
Every time you're awake, you're asleep.
Every time you're spitting up, you're hungry.
Guys, you're identical twins.
Do something identical.
Honey, you seem a little cranky.
Why don't you take a nap.
What, a nap?
Two hours of sleep a night is more than enough for Mighty Dad.
That's the spirit.
Next time, I say we go for triplets.
You may have to go without me.
- Hey, bub.
See that Elvis?
"And from then on, all the other tugboats cheered when Melvin, the littlest tugboat, went toot, toot.
The end".
When Daddy tells the story, he goes, "Toot, toot"!
Toot, toot!
A little louder.
Toot, toot!
A little softer.
Toot, toot.
You forgot to pull the handle.
Here's your glass of kitchen water.
Are you sure it's from the kitchen?
Taste it.
Yep, that's the kitchen.
Now, we turn on the light.
And we lock your dollhouse.
- Sweet dreams.
Sweet dreams.
See, I told you we could do it just like Daddy.
Uh-uh.
You need to work on your tugboat.
Well, I think I'll have another chance.
Dad made a date for every night this week.
You got to be kidding.
No.
Dad's out having fun right now.
What could be more fun than me?
SINGERS : Wake up!
Before we bring out our first guest, I'd like to give you the update on Danny Tanner, Bachelor of the Month, Day 10.
Last night was so romantic.
Amber and I spent the evening riding bumper cars.
Oh, boy, can she bump.
I don't think our viewers need to hear about another one of your shallow dates.
- Our first guest for today is-- - Excuse me, did you just say shallow?
Well, you've been out with 24 women in 10 nights.
What would you call that?
Quality time.
Like I said, Danny, shallow.
Oh, I'm sure your dating life is so deep.
I can just picture you out with some stuffed shirt discussing Russian literature over white wine and Brie.
Oh, I can imagine what your dating life is like.
"Gee, Amber, I wonder which bumper car goes the fastest"?
Well, if you'd-- If you'd like to find out what I'm like on a date why don't you experience the real thing.
Are you asking me out right here in front of all our viewers?
Sure makes it harder for you to say no, doesn't it?
Yeah, why don't you come over to my house tonight and-- And I'll-- I'll take you out to dinner.
What do you say?
Is it a date?
- It's a date.
- Great.
And then tomorrow, you-- You can tell everybody that I'm not the shallow, bubbleheaded bachelor you think I am.
Or I can call it like I see it.
Jess, that is the third Cindi that's called Danny today.
How does he keep all these women straight?
Well, see, I used to use memory tricks, like, uh.
Like if I went out with Lisa and she wore lace it was Lacy Lisa, right?
Heather wore leather, so-- Well, that one's easy.
And then, like, Rhonda was, like, uh help me, Rhonda.
Help, help me, Rhonda.
- Help you do what, Jess?
- Whoa!
Here, this stuff is clean.
Great, because all this stuff is dirty.
Does it ever end?
Honey, one more thing.
Don't forget to change the crib liner because Alex spit up again.
Is it my imagination, or is more coming out than going in?
I know.
It's one of the mysteries of science.
Hey, what happened to Mighty Dad and Mighty Momma?
We're mighty pooped.
You two should really pace yourselves.
The twins don't even move yet.
That's a wet cry.
- Whose turn is it?
- Whose turn is it?
- Yours.
- Yours.
- All right, I'll go.
- All right, I'll go.
Once upon a time, there was a lad named Daniel.
And he became the Prince of the Month.
But Prince Daniel's cohost, Princess Vicky she thought that Daniel was nothing more than a shallow maiden chaser.
So Prince Daniel decided to sweep Princess Vicky off of her feet with his charming, dashing ways, and make her eat her words in front of the whole TV kingdom.
Not your best story.
Wait, I'm not done.
And the two of them sailed off into the sunset on a beautiful magic tugboat.
Toot, toot!
I do love that tugboat.
Okay, honey, you've got your kitchen water.
We turn the nightlight on.
We lock the dollhouse door, and we say, "Sweet dreams".
I thought we were gonna play.
Daddy's tucking me in.
Before dinner?
Well, Teddy, I have a date tonight so we're doing Michelle's bedtime routine a little early.
Now I can get up and play.
This is a strange family.
I'll see you in the morning, honey.
Daddy, can I go on your date with you?
No.
No, dating that's something you'll do when you're.
Well, in your 30s.
Good night.
My daddy's always leaving me.
How come?
Because he's spatula of the month.
If you say so.
I wanna go on my daddy's date.
But your daddy said no.
Then we have to be very sneaky.
Uh, we?
That's right, you're my date.
Uncle Jesse and Aunt Becky are on their way down.
- Is their surprise dinner ready?
- Yes, I made my specialty.
Pork and beans in a white-wine sauce.
- Hey, everybody.
Hey, Danny.
Hi, Dad.
D.J.: Hi, Dad.
Guess where I'm going?
On a date.
Yeah, but not just any date.
Guess who I'm going out with?
Princess Vicky.
Man, I told that story to everybody.
D.J.: Bye.
- Bye-bye.
Steph, sweetie, what is it?
We're very busy.
Ah, the Katsopolis party of two.
Right this way.
Your table is awaiting.
Over there, and you right over there.
Wow, this is very sweet of you.
- Hey, you guys did this for us?
- That's right.
Jesse and Rebecca, you've won a night of free childcare and a romantic dinner for two.
Pork and beans?
In a white-wine sauce.
- Well, thank you.
Thank you, guys.
All right.
- Wow.
- Boy.
Gee, I can't believe we have the whole evening to ourselves.
All right, this is a chance to have an adult conversation without talking about the babies.
We'll catch up on the rest our lives.
- You're right.
- Okay.
So how's your music going?
Well, I haven't spent much time in the studio since the babies were born.
Babies.
So, uh.
So you miss the Wake Up, San Francisco show?
Boy, tell you the truth, since the babies have been born I haven't had much time to think about it.
- You said it.
- I said babies.
- Yeah.
- Right.
You know, Nicky did the cutest thing today.
Really?
What did he do?
Well, when he sneezed, he looked like a bunny rabbit.
- Oh, I missed a bunny sneeze?
I can't-- - Yeah.
Okay, we're doing it.
We're-- Come on, now, this is a chance to really enjoy ourselves.
- And let's take advantage of it, okay?
- You're right, you're right.
All right, girls, diaper alert.
We have a little problem here, so let's settle this the mature adult way.
Rock, Scissors, Paper.
One, two, three.
- Scissors cut paper.
- Scissors cut paper.
Joey, you lose.
You have to change Nicky's diaper.
- Have fun.
- Come on, girls.
- Good luck.
- Hey, come on.
Give me a break here, okay.
Okay.
: All right, let's see what you got here, Swee'Pea.
Whoa!
Oh, gosh.
Nothing sweet about this.
I should change me name to Poopeye, that's for sure.
Oh, gosh.
Okay, let's get you cleaned up here.
Now, I volunteered to do this out of the goodness of my heart.
So let's have a nice thank you for your Uncle Joey.
Well, blow me down.
Oh, gosh, you missed me, you little squirt.
Oh, gosh.
Well, at least your mom and dad get to enjoy a nice romantic dinner to themselves.
I'm very excited you agreed to come with me here, Vicky.
This is gonna be a lot of fun.
Well, welcome to Chez Lyon, the hippest bistro in town.
Prices are high, portions are small and the waiters are snooty.
You're gonna love it.
I can't wait.
I hope the chairs are hard.
Oh, thank you very much.
Right this way.
We did it.
I've never been that quiet in my whole life.
Me neither.
Much better.
Let's go eat.
- Sir, your table is ready.
- Thank you.
Um, could the lady and I have a nice booth instead, perhaps?
A booth?
I'm afraid not.
Right this way.
This is a grown-up restaurant.
Let's act like grown-ups.
This way, my dear.
- Good evening.
- Thank you.
- Good evening.
- Hello.
Thank you.
Ah, they have the most delightful pÃ¢tÃ© here.
You're going to enjoy this.
Would you please tell Frederick bonjour from Danny Tanner.
Frederick quit a year and a half ago.
Oh, um, did he leave any pÃ¢tÃ©?
So, Danny, do you come here often?
Very funny.
So, what would you like to talk about?
Politics?
Russian literature?
All right.
Which Karamazov brother did you find most compelling?
Oh, I don't know.
Hoss?
Little Joe?
Okay, we can go in now.
There's my daddy.
Let's go surprise him.
But there's no chairs for us.
Here's a bigger table.
Daddy.
- Excuse me.
Who are you here with?
My daddy.
He's on a date.
Oh, so that'll be four.
I'll start with a Happy Meal.
I'll have what she's having, but hold the pickle.
Whoa, baby.
There's a happy meal.
Grab a fork.
Daddy's missing all the fun.
Daddy.
Uh, Danny, there's a young lady waving at you.
Oh, yeah, I know.
It's all part of the price I pay for being Bachelor of the Month.
Well, I don't wanna make you jealous, so I'm not even gonna look.
No, really, you-- You ought to look.
Daddy, you gotta try the happy meal.
Oh, my God, it's my daughter.
Michelle, how did you get here?
In your car.
We were hiding in the back seat.
If we're in trouble, it was her idea.
You're both definitely in trouble.
Please, into the booth, both of you.
- Is everything all right?
No.
My daughter and her friend stowed away in my car.
Michelle why did you do that?
Because I never see you anymore.
Is that because you're the spatula of the month?
Eat your dessert, Teddy.
Michelle, how could you say you never see me anymore?
I see you every morning, and I told you a bedtime story tonight.
Before dinner doesn't count.
You don't tuck me in anymore.
Sweetheart, if I'm not able to tuck you in for some reason there's always someone else there to tuck you in.
It's not the same.
You do the best tugboat.
Actually, she has a point there.
I do one heck of a "toot, toot"!
That does not excuse you from leaving the house and sneaking into my car.
Am I in big trouble?
Well, actually, it's not all your fault.
I should've talked to you about this whole dating thing before I started going out every night.
I know how important it is to you that I tuck you in.
It's important to me too.
I love our special times together.
I'll tell you what.
Why don't you and I make a special date tomorrow night at your bedtime for me to tuck you in.
What do you say?
Is it a date?
It's a date.
I love you, honey.
I love you, Daddy.
Oh.
Danny, since we're all here, why don't we make this a double date?
Okay.
Well, if you'll excuse me I'll call home and tell them that the kids are okay.
I wonder how much she tipped for that booth.
Excuse me.
Here we go.
This is okay with your daddy, right?
Right.
I had a great time, Michelle.
I hope we double date again soon.
Tomorrow's good for me.
Honey, why don't we go over your social calendar when I come up to tuck you in, okay?
I'll be waiting with the tugboat book.
Toot, toot!
You still got it.
Look, Vicky, I'm sorry.
This wasn't the scintillating evening I was hoping for.
Actually, it was fun.
I hope you don't mind if I tell our viewers you're a terrific dad.
Thanks.
Look, I got a little carried away with all those women suddenly wanting to go out with me.
The truth is, I'm not really a super-stud bachelor.
Somehow, I knew that.
You know, I'm just looking for somebody special.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
I'm going through the same thing.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Well.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Ooh!
I'll be right up, honey.
Toot, toot!
- Well, I'll see you at work tomorrow.
- Okay.
- Good night.
- Night.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Jolting Joey Gladstone is at the plate.
Stephanie Tanner, the crafty right-hander, is on the mound.
The windup, the pitch.
Strike three.
You're out!
What?
That ball was outside by a mile.
Ball four!
It was a strike!
- It was a ball!
- It was a strike!
- It was a ball!
- It was a strike!
- It was a strike!
- It was a ball!
Oh, so it was a ball.
Thank you very much.
Hey, you tricked me.
You're out of the game.
- What?
- You heard the ump.
You're out of here.
Yeah, hit the showers.
And wash behind your ears.
All right, fine.
I'm out of the game?
I'm just taking my bat and ball and I'm going home.
Hold it, you're back in the game.
Play ball!
- Play ball!
- Play ball.
Danny, dare I ask what you're doing?
I'm cleaning my leaves.
You're gonna clean every leaf in the garden?
Of course not, Joey, that would be totally compulsive behavior.
I'm just doing the dirty ones.
Hello, boys.
Hey, biker babe, how's it going?
Not good.
A boy said: Baby, baby Stick your head in gravy Well, Michelle, if he said that, then he's the baby.
Next time, you just be a big girl and say: So so suck your toe All the way to Mexico You're a wonderful role model.
At least I don't simonize my plants.
Michelle, why would somebody call you a baby?
Because I still need baby training wheels.
Honey, that's all right.
Kids take off their training wheels at all different ages.
I was even a little older than you.
Danny, you still had training wheels on your paper route.
I wanna learn how to ride right now.
That's the Tanner spirit.
I wonder who could teach me.
Daddy?
Michelle, honestly, I'd love to teach you but Vicky's coming over and we've got to work on next week's shows.
- I'd love to teach you tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?
Hello, Joe.
Danny, can I teach her how to ride?
Please, please, please?
With a cherry on top?
You know I can't say no to that.
That's why I said it.
Okay, sweetheart.
But I am gonna be the one that teaches you how to drive on your 30th birthday.
Michelle, when I get finished with you, you're gonna be riding on two wheels.
- Yes!
- Burning rubber.
- Yes!
- Popping wheelies.
- Yes!
- Jumping over school buses.
Oh, no, no, no.
Yes, yes, yes.
You two are the most beautiful babies in the whole world.
Now, I know every other mother says that but every other mother is wrong.
Because you two really are the most beautiful babies in the whole world.
Yes, you are.
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi, honey.
I was just out getting the mail.
It is a perfect day in San Francisco so I got a great idea.
We pack the kids up and go on their first car ride.
- What do you think?
- Jess, that's a great idea.
Can we do that?
Well, they're our kids, it's our car.
I think, it's legal.
What do you say, Nickster, Big Al, you cats wanna go for a ride?
See that?
They're psyched.
Boy, just like the old days.
I can't believe we're doing this.
We're gonna hop in the car, take a drive just like we did before we had the two most beautiful babies in the whole world.
Beck, we're still the same fun-loving, free-spirited people it's just there's more of us.
Now, I've got the perfect place to go.
- The Harley shop.
- Aunt Ida's.
- Aunt Ida's?
- The Harley shop?
The new Ultra Glides are in, and the kids were just saying yesterday they're dying to see them.
But Aunt Ida's got a new hairdo.
Aunt Ida hates me, all right?
She calls me the Hoodlum.
For your wedding she got you that book, Smart Women, Foolish Choices.
- Oh, she's kidding, just kidding.
- Yeah, I love her comedy.
Jess, come on, honey, she's still my aunt and she's begging me to bring them over.
All right, all right, okay.
We'll visit the Harley shop, we'll go check out Ida's new 'do, okay?
That's great.
We'll be like spontaneous.
We're gonna ride like the wind.
Huh, boys?
Ride like the wind.
- Okay!
- Grab a kid.
Let's go!
Oh, wait, honey, before we ride like the wind Alex needs to be fed, yes, he does, and Nicky needs to take a nap.
We don't want them to be cranky when we go to Aunt Ida's.
Yeah, Ida's cranky enough for all of us.
All right.
Here we go, boys, you gotta eat and take a nap.
Then when we're done, we're gonna ride like the wind, huh?
Doesn't that sound great?
They can hardly contain themselves.
Oh, no, I hate this video.
Where's the remote?
It's on top of the TV.
Oh, well.
Girls, it's such a beautiful day outside.
Wouldn't you like to go get some fresh air?
- No.
- No.
- Don't you have some homework to do?
- No.
Do you have some friends you wanna hang out with?
- No.
- Let me give you another option.
Please leave.
Look, I gotta work in here, okay?
Vicky's coming over.
- Ooh.
- Ooh.
There is nothing to "ooh" about.
Oh, yes, there is, you kissed her.
Dad, don't be so embarrassed.
You two make a cute couple.
Go for it.
Look, it was one little good-night kiss.
We haven't even talked about it since.
What?
You've worked with her every day and you haven't even brought it up?
Why are you such a chicken?
I am not a chicken.
This is a very delicate situation, and I'm proceeding cautiously because--  Will you girls please give me a break?
Maybe she doesn't even remember the kiss.
Maybe she hated it.
Think positive.
Maybe she doesn't remember she hated it.
That's Vicky.
- Ooh.
- Ooh.
There's nothing between us.
- Hi, Danny.
- Hi.
- Hi, girls.
- Hi, Vicky.
We were just talking about you.
No, no, we weren't.
Yeah, we were talking about the fact that you were just outside the door, but now that you're inside our talk is pretty much over.
Thanks for catching me up.
Well, Steph, let's go to the store.
Do you guys need anything?
Milk, juice, ChapStick?
Thanks, we'll be fine.
You can take your time at the store.
Are you sure you don't need any more Binaca, Dad?
Bye, girls.
Aren't they precious?
Danny, you seem a little nervous.
Is anything wrong?
No.
No, no, no.
Well, great.
Then should we get to work?
Yes.
Yes, yes, yes.
Uh, I made a list of possible guests for next week Joe Montana, Henry Kisser, Sean Penn.
- Kisser?
- Excuse me?
You just said Henry Kisser.
No, I said Henry Kissinger.
It's written right there.
Why would I say Henry Kisser?
Oh, that's right.
Why would you say that?
It's not on your lips.
Your list, your list.
Vicky, why are we doing this?
We both know that we kissed last week.
You're right.
And now that it's out in the open, I think, the best thing to do is to forget it ever happened.
Right!
It's forgotten whatever it was.
I mean, not that it wasn't a nice kiss.
I liked it.
Really?
I liked it too.
A lot.
But that doesn't matter now, because.
- It never happened.
- It never happened.
All right, Michelle, you got your helmet.
You got your goggles, you got your elbow pads.
You got your knee pads, you got your shin pads.
You ready to ride?
I don't know if I can move.
Well, better safe than sorry.
You don't want to get hurt.
Hurt?
Why did you say that word?
I'm sure you won't get hurt, but this way at least you'll be protected in case you fall off.
Fall off?
More bad words.
Okay, time out.
Forget about all those bad words.
There's really nothing to it.
Now, watch carefully as I get on the bike push off and pedal.
See?
Nothing to it!
No hands!
- Hello.
- Hello.
This isn't my bike.
That's not my kid!
I'm available!
Probably not into big guys with small bikes.
Okay, now, it's your turn, Michelle.
Just hop on, push off, and start peddling, and I'll hold on to the back.
- That's it?
Piece of cake.
All right, get on the bike.
I'll hold on to the back.
And trust me, there's nothing to worry about.
Okay?
On your mark, get set, start peddling.
Attagirl.
All right, looking good.
This is easy.
Attagirl.
You're doing it all by yourself!
I am?
Holy cow!
Whoa.
Michelle, are you okay?
I am so sorry.
Are you hurt?
You let go of me.
I only let go because you were doing so well.
Then why am I in this bush?
Okay, let's get you out of there, kiddo.
I think you're gonna be okay.
No, I'm not.
I got a scrape!
Ouch!
Well, it's not a bad scrape, you're gonna be just fine.
Let's get back on the bike and try again.
What am I?
Nuts?
This time I promise I won't let go.
I'll never trust you again.
Michelle.
Michelle!
Come on, sweetheart.
Michelle, I'm sorry you fell off your bike.
Okay, if you won't talk to Joey, will you talk to your old pal Bullwinkle?
Okay.
Tell Joey I'm very mad at him.
Joey, Michelle is very mad at you.
Maybe you could tell her that it was just an accident and I love her like crazy?
- Maybe she won't believe you.
- She will.
- She won't.
- She will.
- She won't.
- She will.
- I saw a smile.
- Oops.
Nope too late, I already saw you smiling.
Only because you were funny.
Well, that's a start.
Can I fix that scrape for you?
Can Bullwinkle do it?
Why, certainly.
Dr. Bullwinkle T. Moose at your service.
Just have a seat in my office.
Okay, here we go.
Now, sit tight for a moment.
Now, this may sting a little.
- Ouch, that stings a lot!
- I'm sorry.
You lied again.
Now, I really don't trust you.
It wasn't me, it was Bullwinkle.
Oh, sure, blame it on the moose.
Okay, you're fed, changed, dressed and still napping.
And one hour later we're ready to be totally spontaneous.
Not so fast.
We've gotta put on our C.T.H.'s.
Our car-trip hats.
Jess, Aunt Ida hates it when you wear your hat backwards.
I know.
Boys, get ready to bug your Aunt Ida.
There you go.
There you go.
All right!
Now, we're ready to ride like the wind.
Wait a minute.
We need extra diapers.
Right.
All right, you guys rest up because when you meet Aunt Ida you won't sleep for days.
Jesse Katsopolis!
Here.
Let's grab this bag.
- Okay.
- All right.
Got the diapers.
- Baby wipes.
- Baby wipes.
Very good.
You know what?
Nicky's got a rash.
We need that baby butt stuff.
Here it is.
Okay, one more diaper and we are set.
Just to be safe, we better take everything on the changing table.
Good thinking.
Here we go.
Let's get this.
All right, there we are.
We're spontaneously packed and ready to ride like the wind.
Oh, wait a minute, Jess.
It could get windy.
- We better bring blankets and scarves.
- Good thinking.
But, wait a minute.
What if it rains?
We're gonna have to get their slickers and galoshy-booties, all right?
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
It could get really hot.
Sunsuits.
You know what?
We don't know what's gonna happen.
I say we take the whole dresser.
Honey, I just had a thought.
I mean, this is the first time the boys will be away from home.
Maybe we should bring something familiar and comforting.
Right.
Their Elvismobiles!
You know.
I've been looking for an excuse to hang these on the rear-view mirror anyway.
Do you think they might miss their stuffed animals?
They'll miss their stuffed animals.
We gotta take them!
Here you go.
- Ready, and catch!
- Got it!
- And catch!
- Got it!
- And catch!
- No!
Okay, we've gone over all the days of the week Monday, Tuesday, all those other days.
I'm sorry, Danny.
What did you say?
I have no idea.
I can't think about anything but that kiss.
Me too.
This is crazy.
We work together.
You're right, we cannot start a relationship.
Yeah, and who knows where I'll be after Becky comes back to Wake Up, San Francisco.
Let's just forget about it.
It's forgotten.
Whoa!
Make Out, San Francisco!
Steph!
Go to your room.
I mean, hi.
- You learn to ride that bike yet?
- That's Michelle.
Nice shade of lipstick, Dad.
Don't you girls have somebody else you can go embarrass?
Sorry, Dad.
You two have fun playing tonsil hockey.
Have I mentioned to you how precious they are?
Vicky why are we doing this to ourselves?
I don't know.
Maybe we should just go with it.
You know what?
You're right.
Let's be crazy, let's be totally outrageous.
Vicky, come with me.
Let's fly to Paris tonight.
Danny, Danny, we have a show to do tomorrow.
How about frozen yogurt?
You wild man.
- Vanilla.
- You're insane.
With sprinkles.
Get the door.
Okay, just follow the sound of my voice, Jess.
Come on, straight ahead.
There you go.
All right, here we go.
We're ready to ride like the wind.
Do you think we really need all this stuff?
I mean, we're only gonna be gone two or three hours.
That's what Gilligan said.
Oh, yeah, good point.
We wouldn't want to get shipwrecked without our Elvismobiles.
Beck, it only took us two hours to get ready to be very spontaneous to go to the Harley shop and Aunt Ida's, let's go.
Jess, let's face it.
Life as we knew it is no more.
Next time we want to be spontaneous, let's plan ahead.
Honey, could you get that?
Kidding.
Aunt Ida!
We were just coming to see you.
Becky, that's not funny.
Hi, Jesse.
Hi, Aunt Ida.
Beautiful new do.
I was in the neighborhood.
Turn your hat around, you look like a hoodlum.
My little babies.
- Hi, Michelle.
Hi, Michelle.
Wanna buy a bike?
It's only 50 cents.
No, thanks.
Hey, Joey told us you fell off your bike.
So why don't we get one last shot of you sitting on the bike that you're never gonna ride again?
Is this a trick?
Michelle, bubbie, baby.
If we wanted to trick you, we'd think of something a little more clever than asking you to sit on your bike.
Now, sit on your bike.
I'll hold you.
Steph, how does she look?
I think the light would be better way over there.
Steph, you are so right.
Now, Michelle, I'll hold you steady, you just start peddling.
Stop the bike.
I wanna get off.
All right, hop off.
- This was a trick.
Shame on you!
- We're sorry, Michelle.
We thought you should give your bike another chance.
Maybe you didn't see this scrape.
Girls, can I talk to Michelle for a minute?
- Sure.
- Good luck.
Michelle, it's obvious you're way too smart to fall for a trick.
It's very obvious.
Would you go for a bribe?
Never!
What do you got?
Well, if you give me a chance to teach you how to ride you can have your very own copy of The Little Mermaid.
No, thank you.
It's your favorite movie.
It's on cable all month.
Michelle, I'm sorry that you had an accident.
But I had to let go.
That's how you learn.
Otherwise, every kid you see riding a bike would have a grownup hanging on the back.
That's better than falling in a bush.
I'm gonna tell you something I should've told you before we ever started.
You don't know what you're doing?
No, that learning to ride a bike is hard work.
No matter how many times you fall you have to keep trying because once you get it right, it's really worth it.
Are you sure about this?
Hey, come on, you and I are buds.
We go way back.
Until you wiped out, did I ever let you down?
No.
Well, then how about giving your old pal Joey one more chance?
- Okay, old pal.
- Attagirl.
Kiss?
You're not gonna let me go, right?
No way.
Not until you say so.
Okay, let's do it!
All right, you're doing it, Michelle.
- Let go!
- Are you sure?
- Let go!
- Are you really, really sure?
I said, let go!
Way to go!
I'm not in the bush!
Michelle, I am so proud of you.
You did it all by yourself.
Uh-uh, Joey, I did it with you.
Wanna go for another ride?
Okay, let's go!
Okay, Michelle.
Here we go!
I'll race you home!
- Try and catch me!
- Michelle, Michelle!
Michelle, not so fast.
Wait for me!
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
All right, Beck, let's make this really interesting, okay?
Whoever burps their baby faster gets out of diaper duty for the whole entire day.
- What do you say?
- You are on, pal.
Because I have Alex and let's face it, he is the king of gas.
Yes, that may be true, but we want it more.
Right, Nicky?
See that?
He's got the eye of the tiger.
All right, ready, and burp them.
Come on, Nicky.
Come on, come on.
Come on, Alex, come, my baby.
- What's going on?
Go, Alex.
We're having a little contest to see who could burp the fastest.
I won.
I'm still the burp champion.
In your face.
Okay, boys, this is your first trip to Aunt Ida's.
And we're gonna have a good time.
She's gonna hug you and kiss you and pinch your little cheeks for about three hours.
All right, boys, let's get out there and make Channel 8 a winner.
Because we're lean.
We're mean.
And we're clean.
Honey, I've never actually seen you on ice skates.
Do you know anything at all about hockey?
I took the kids to Smurfs on Ice.
What's to know?
The point is: the boys are back and we're having a good time.
- We're hanging out together, the boys.
- That's right.
- Hanging out like the old days.
- Right.
One for all and all for one.
Just like the Three Musketeers.
Athos.
- Porthos.
- Annette.
It's not Mouseketeers, it's the Musketeers.
Guys, I have a question.
Why do I have to be the goalie?
Danny, come on.
Goalie is the safest position on the ice.
Yeah?
Then why am I wearing  Joey, how fast are those pucks going anyway?
Not fast.
Ninety, 100 miles per hour.
Maybe I should just sit on the bench and make you guys some hot cocoa.
I got it, I think.
- Hey, Vicky.
- Hey.
Ooh, I can't wait to see my co-host in action.
Really?
Guys, what are we waiting for?
Hot cocoa?
Let's get out on the ice.
All right, let me rub your bald little heads for good luck, okay?
Beck, if they don't start growing hair within a week I'm buying them both matching baby toupees.
All right, here we go.
Okay, Deej, we're leaving.
I'll be right out, Vicky.
Bye, Dad.
Have fun at the game.
Try not to get hurt.
Hey, I can take care of myself.
But Deej, if anything happens to me I love you so much.
Thanks for giving up a Saturday to babysit, hon.
Oh, it's no problem.
I was supposed to go out with Steve, but he never called.
It's no big deal.
Okay, so he's a total hunk.
But it's no big deal.
Did I say that already?
Because it's no big deal.
Oh, and I want you to make sure Stephanie finishes her book report.
I don't want Michelle outside because she has the sniffles, okay?
Got it.
Thanks, Deej.
I owe you one.
You mean, like, one red Mustang convertible?
No, I mean like one more big dad hug.
Come here.
Hi, Stephanie.
Hello, Michelle.
Michelle, do you mind?
No.
Don't you have anything better to do than sniffle in my ear while I'm working?
I don't know where it comes from, but it just keeps coming.
D.J.: I'll get it.
- Steve.
Hi.
- Hi back.
You look great.
Thanks.
Well, it's nice to see you.
What are you doing here?
Didn't you get my note about going to the movies?
I gave it to Maria to give it to Kimmy to give to you in Home Ec.
Oh, no wonder I didn't get it.
Kimmy always ditches Home Ec.
She says she's gonna marry a doctor and get a maid.
- Hey, let's go to the movies.
- Great, we're out of here.
Wait, I'm not out of here.
I have to babysit.
Oh, too bad.
No, wait, I can go.
- What about babysitting?
- Oh, yeah.
Well, that's no problem because we'll take my little sisters with us.
Your little sisters?
Oh, you'll love them.
They're adorable.
Wait till you see them.
Okay, we're going to the movies.
Put on your coats and act adorable.
I cannot leave this house.
Dad said.
Well, Dad's not here.
I'm in charge.
That makes me dad.
Until the real dad comes back and makes you grounded.
You don't get it.
The hottest guy in the junior class is in our living room.
He has his own car and he can grow a mustache in less than a month.
Are you sure you wanna do this?
Well, sure, I'm sure.
Girls, come with me.
I'd like you to meet a very good friend of mine.
Steve, these are my sisters, Stephanie and Michelle.
Let's see you grow a mustache.
Not that I don't trust you, Stevearino.
But can I see your driver's license?
I told you they were adorable.
We'd better get going.
Thunder Raceway starts in a half hour.
Thunder Raceway?
I believe that's rated PG.
Parental guidance suggested.
No parents, no guidance, no go.
Come on, Steph, give me a break.
The only G-rated movie out is The Littlest Sea Lion.
- I've been dying to see that.
- Yeah, me too.
I love when the little sea lion goes:  - I'm really sorry about this.
- Hey, it's all right.
Hopefully, we won't even be watching the movie.
Why not?
Okay, no more questions.
Everybody in the car.
I got the front seat!
Wanna hear something amazing?
Sure, kid.
I told you they were adorable.
Okay, we got drinks, popcorn, mints, licorice, chocolate raisins and of course, bonbons.
You forgot the nachos.
Michelle, let's not be pigs.
Steph, where's my change?
Change?
If there was any money left, I would've bought nachos.
Oh, Steph.
Excuse me, could you save our place?
Thanks.
Steve, this is really embarrassing but I don't have enough money to pay for my sisters.
I only have enough for us.
We should just forget the whole thing.
No, no, wait.
Why don't you just buy our tickets.
Kimmy started working here.
Maybe she'll have an idea.
That'll be a first.
Thank you.
Enjoy the show.
Don't spill anything.
I'm the one that has to clean up.
Hey, Kimmy, we need to talk.
I know.
You're with Steve Peters.
So why'd you bring those rug rats?
I had no choice.
Hey, can I borrow 10 bucks?
Yeah, sure.
But I can't get it right now.
I'm on duty.
If I leave, kids will sneak in.
Kimmy, that's the answer.
You have to sneak my sisters in.
What?
You're asking me to commit a crime my first day on the job?
I'm shocked.
- You're not gonna do it?
- Well, of course I'll do it.
But I'm still shocked.
Thanks, you're my hero.
Thank you.
- Come on, Michelle.
- I got our tickets.
Great.
- Thank you, enjoy the show.
- Thanks.
You two, go right on in.
Hold it.
Where's our stubs?
Uh, you don't need any.
Tell them, Kimmy.
Yeah, that's right.
Because you're the one millionth customer.
I'm the one millionth customer?
All right.
What do I win?
A new car?
No, you win a free pass for you and a guest.
Oh, let's see.
Who should I take?
What are you?
Nuts?
Take me.
- Come along.
- Let's go.
Keep the line moving.
Thank you.
- How's this?
- Perfect.
This is cozy.
It'll be even cozier when you two move behind us.
Come on, right now.
Let's go.
Enjoy The Little Sea Lion.
See you when it's over.
All right, a Pink Panther cartoon.
Shh!
I don't wanna hear a peep out of you two until the movie's over.
- Peep.
- Peep.
I mean it.
Watch this, Michelle.
He's gonna put his arm around D.J. He's getting closer, closer.
D.J., watch out!
That's it.
You two, in the back row, right now.
Come on.
Move it, move it, move it.
How rude.
Now, where were we?
I think we were right about here.
Excuse me, young ladies.
I'm sorry to bother you.
We've had some kids switching theaters.
Could I check your ticket stubs?
We don't need any.
I'm the one millionth customer.
And this is my guest, one millionth and one.
- Better come with me.
- Come on, Michelle.
I'll bet we won a new car.
Oh, sorry, I'll wait.
Smooch away.
Kimmy, what is it?
My manager just busted your twerpy sisters.
He's taking them into his office.
Oh, man, if he calls my dad, I'm dead.
You're dead?
I could lose my job.
They better not squeal on me.
G-I-B-B-L-E-R.
Gibbler.
Now, why would Kimmy Gibbler tell you that you're the one millionth customer?
We've only been open a week.
Well, sir, I'm sorry to have to tell you this but you've hired a nut case.
Well, now, don't cry.
I'm not crying, I got the sniffles.
That was a good one.
Here you are.
Girls, I am so disappointed in you.
- Who are you?
- I'm their sister, sir.
The good sister.
What scam did they run this time?
The old one-millionth-customer story?
But Kimmy said that-- Shame on you, blaming sweet, poor, innocent Kimmy.
Sir, they may look cute, but don't be fooled.
They've been sneaking into G-rated movies all over town.
In fact, they're known as Snake and Sniffles.
Which one am I?
Well, I called your home, but no one answered.
Oh, that's too bad.
My father needs to know about this.
Don't worry, I'll make sure they get punished like they've never been punished before.
Snake, Sniffles, let's go.
I'm Sniffles?
Yes, you're Sniffles.
Oh, I get it.
That's because I have the sniffles.
Good one.
Oh, sir?
One last thing.
The popcorn could be a little fresher.
And stay out.
All right, you two girls have a seat.
Now, we are not out of the woods yet.
We can't tell Dad what happened so we have to tell him what didn't happen.
You mean, you want us to lie to Dad?
No, I don't want you to lie.
I just want you to tell a fib.
A tiny little fiblet.
Why?
So you won't get in trouble?
You didn't do your book report, so you're in trouble too.
Rats.
Am I in trouble like Snake?
No, but one day you will be.
And Stephanie and I will be there to bail you out.
- So will you help us?
- Let me think.
All right, I'm in.
Now, the secret to a good lie-- Fiblet, is details.
Now, Steph.
You worked on your book report all day.
For lunch you had a bologna sandwich sliced diagonally with a glass of chocolate milk and a Ho Ho.
Can I have a Ding Dong instead of a Ho Ho?
Whatever.
Now, Michelle.
When Dad asks you what you did today, you say: "D.J. and I played Candyland and I won".
Can I have a Ding Dong too?
What is it with you kids and Ding Dongs?
If Snake gets one, then Sniffles should get one too.
Okay, you get a Ding Dong for winning Candyland.
Wow, I had a great day.
Are you sure this will work?
Oh, it can't miss as long as we stick to our story.
Now, Michelle, what did you do today?
Duh.
I went to the movies with you and got in trouble.
We're doomed.
Michelle, you played Candyland with me and won a Ding Dong, remember?
Oh, yeah.
Can I take back my "duh"?
Come on, get off my case.
So I wasn't the best skater out there.
You call that skating?
Your butt never left the ice.
Even flat on my back, I got some good shots off.
Yeah, you got the winning goal for the other team.
The goalie should have blocked that shot.
Or any shot.
Danny, what the heck were you doing on your hands and knees anyway?
I was just cleaning the slush around my area.
It's not an area.
It happens to be a goal crease.
And you're supposed to be defending it, not cleaning it.
I was defending it, until it got all icky.
- Danny, you got a real problem.
- You got a problem.
You take this hockey stuff way too seriously.
Hey, listen, Dippity-do head.
What, Elmer Fudd face?
Take that back, Dohead.
Make me, Fuddface.
Hey, hey, hey.
Dohead, Fuddface.
Come on.
What happened to the Three Musketeers?
Musketeer this, Mop & Glo.
It's Mr. Mop & Glo to you, buddy.
Okay, boys, you made it through your first visit to Aunt Ida's.
And I promise we'll get all that lipstick off.
Here we go.
Hello, boys.
Hello.
We were just horsing around.
That's right.
Just three guys horsing around.
Yup, it's a guy thing.
Oh, isn't that cute?
Your daddy and his buddies roughhousing like little boys.
Well, I guess that's how you strengthen those bonds of male friendship.
Just like those chimps we saw last week at the zoo.
Becky's right.
We're no better than chimps.
Yeah, what's wrestling around on the carpeting gonna prove anyhow?
Wanna see who can do the most push-ups?
Yeah.
Get used to it.
Here comes Dad.
Now, everybody remember their stories.
Bologna sandwich, book report.
Candyland, Ding Dong.
- Hey, girls.
Hello.
Deej, thanks again for babysitting.
It's great to know I have a mature, responsible daughter that I can count on.
Thanks, Dad.
D.J.: I am scum.
I'm lower than scum.
I'm the scum they scrape off scum.
- Steph, did you finish your book report?
- Sure did.
And I had a bologna sandwich, diagonally sliced a refreshing glass of chocolate milk, and a Ding Dong.
That sounds so fake.
Sounds like you had a really productive day.
He bought it.
How was your day, Michelle?
Let's see.
We're busted.
I played Candyland with D.J. and I won a Ding Dong.
Yes!
That's great.
You know what, honey?
Let me get a tissue and wipe your nose for you.
There you go.
I've turned my sisters into liars.
But good liars.
I got an idea.
Since you girls were all cooped up in the house all day we'll go to a movie tonight.
- All right.
- Uh-oh.
He knows something.
How about The Littlest Sea Lion?
Have you girls seen it?
No, Dad, I can honestly say we haven't.
Great.
Since you're becoming so responsible maybe it's time I raised your allowance.
I don't deserve a raise.
How does two-fifty more a week sound?
Sounds great.
Why is he torturing me?
I love you, sweetheart.
I can't take it anymore.
I can't take it anymore.
Dad, Steve came over and we took Stephanie and Michelle to the movies.
We didn't have enough money, so I made Kimmy sneak them in and then we got caught and I forced them to lie to you about the whole thing.
And that's what really happened.
I feel so much better.
Ooh, that's a bad face.
I'm really sorry, Dad.
So am I. I can't believe this.
It's true.
The whole thing about the bologna sandwich?
Never happened.
Go ahead, Dad, ground me.
All right, you're grounded, all three of you.
We're all grounded?
- Even me, your little princess?
- Dad, they don't deserve it.
I told them that they weren't lying, just telling a fiblet.
They still went along with it.
Ultimately, you're each responsible for the choices that you made and you're gonna have to accept the consequences.
Huh?
That means: you do the crime, you do the time.
Does this mean no Little Sea Lion?
No Little Sea Lion.
That's the second time I missed him today.
Deej, what happened?
We got away with the whole thing and then you blew it.
I couldn't go through with it.
You ever hear that little voice in your head saying, "This is wrong"?
Sure.
But I told it to shut up and I listened to you.
Do I have a little voice in my head?
Yeah, everybody does.
It's called your conscience.
And when you do something you know is wrong your conscience reminds you over and over and over and over until you do something about it.
It sounds like a pain in the neck.
Look, I'm really sorry I got you guys grounded.
But thanks for backing me up.
Tell you what, Steph.
I am gonna help you with this book report.
And after that, Michelle, you and I are gonna play Candyland.
And I promise to spend more time with both of you guys.
Give me a hug.
Hey, you guys can hang out in my room any time you want.
Whoa, D.J., don't get carried away.
Yeah.
Let's start.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Nicky, take it easy.
Save some room for the Peking duck.
Just a little pre-solid food humor.
Oh, I can't believe I have to go back to work already.
I'm gonna miss my pookey bears so much.
You'll see them in an hour.
You're putting them on your show today.
Yeah, but what if they do something cute?
What if they learn to talk?
I'll have them call you.
Okay, let's roll.
Today's our big "Farewell Vicky Show".
And?
And our even bigger "Welcome Back Becky Show".
You and Vicky were going pretty hot.
Thought you'd be down about her leaving.
Down?
Me?
Mr. Up?
Mr. Life-Of-The-Party?
Oh, yeah, man, let the good times roll.
Why did she have to go?
Morning, everyone.
- Morning.
- Good morning.
What are we looking at, Ranger Joe?
Nothing.
I have a stiff neck.
Boy, sure hope my neck loosens up before my show or it's gonna be bird watching day.
Yeah, we can look for woodpeckers.
Well, Joey, keep your chin up.
Guess you have no choice.
Forget it.
You cannot borrow my clothes.
- Please?
- No.
- Please?
- No.
Please, please, please?
I'll do it.
No, no, no.
Remember, my clothes are untouchable, off-limits.
This means you.
Understand?
I understand.
Not.
I'm wearing D.J.'s sweater.
She's gonna have a cow.
All right.
Lunches.
Kisses.
All right, have a good day at school.
Doing all right, boys?
Don't get up.
I'll get it.
Talk to me.
Speaking.
Guys, it's the record company.
Tell me you love the song.
You like the song.
Well, maybe you can learn to love it.
I mean, as a kid, like, I hated blue cheese.
I thought it was like eating, like, sweat socks, but-- No, really.
But eventually, I-- Right.
Okay.
I'm sorry too.
Bye.
Boys your old man got rejected again.
But you still love me, right?
That's what I thought.
Now, we're all in the same boat.
Out-of-work high-fives.
Out-of-work high-fives, come on.
Wake up!
Wake up, San Francisco.
I'm Danny Tanner.
And I'm Vicky Larson.
Today is my last day because Rebecca Donaldson is back from maternity leave.
I'm gonna miss you, Danny.
Oh, Vicky.
You know, I just forgot, we're still on camera.
But, Vicky, I have a big surprise for you.
I spoke to our station manager.
He wants you to do weather reports here on Wake Up, San Francisco.
Isn't that wonderful?
It would be except this morning I was offered an incredible job anchoring the news in Chicago.
Chicago?
The Windy City?
You'll have to wear a hat.
You'll get hat hair.
Why don't we talk about this after the show - because Rebecca's waiting to come-- - Chicago?
Didn't they have a really big fire there?
It was over a hundred years ago.
I'm sure it's out by now.
Hi, I'm Rebecca Donaldson and I'm welcoming myself back to the show.
Welcome back, Becky.
Why, thank you, Becky.
- Welcome back.
- Welcome back.
Thank you.
Thank you, Vicky.
Thank you very much.
I would like all of our viewers to meet the two reasons that I've been out of work for the last eight weeks: Nicky and Alex.
Come on in, boys.
Hi.
Hi, baby.
And, everybody, this is my wonderful husband, Jesse.
Say hello, honey.
Hello, honey.
And these are our boys.
They're identical twins.
Oh, except Alex has a birthmark on his tushy just like his daddy.
- I'm out of here.
- Oh, no.
Honey.
Honey.
Come on.
I am so proud of this guy.
Do you know what he's gonna do today?
He is going to take care of the kids do the shopping, do the laundry, and cook us a wonderful dinner.
Yeah, right after that, I'm gonna wrestle a bobcat with my bare hands.
Have mercy, 14 pounds.
You guys been sneaking to the kitchen, eating cheeseburgers at night?
All right, there you go.
Here we go.
Fellas, you see this?
This is what you're gonna look like if you don't start growing hair.
Come on.
I got our dinner, Uncle Jesse.
Hold it.
I'm not buying all that junk food.
You better buy these cookies.
I already ate four.
I mean, five.
Billy Bunny cereal.
I gotta have it.
Hold it, Michelle.
Hold it.
Let me tell you something.
Just because there's a goofy character on the box doesn't mean the product's any good, all right?
Oh, my God.
Elvis peanut butter.
Uncle Jesse, isn't that the same thing as Billy Bunny cereal?
No, it is not.
Elvis is a man, not a cartoon.
Now, what do you guys want?
Smooth or Hunka Hunka Chunka?
We'll take both.
All right.
Hey, Nicky, how you do--?
- Did we bring any diapers?
- Diapers, aisle three.
All right, I got an idea.
Come here, pal.
Here we go.
Here, this ought to keep you smelling pine fresh till we get there.
All right, girls, we need milk and bread.
Got it.
No more junk food.
Hey, I saw you on TV this morning.
Really?
Thank you.
You're Rebecca's husband, Jesse Donaldson.
- It's Katsopolis.
Jesse Katsopolis.
- Whatever.
I'm George and it's nice to meet another househusband.
I'm not a househusband.
I'm a musician.
Yeah, I'm a screenwriter.
I'm just doing this because my career's temporarily on hold, okay?
I said the same thing to my wife when she went back to work.
That was four years ago.
So for four years, all you've done is take care of the kids and the house?
Of course not.
I mean, there's shopping and carpools and oh, my favorite soap, General Hospital.
Listen, I gotta run.
I'll see you Thursday, double coupon day.
Hope I can sleep Wednesday night.
These Funky Franks are pretty good.
I better try a few more just to make sure.
Uh-oh.
What have I done?
I got mustard on D.J.'s sweater.
She's gonna have a cow.
Tell me something I don't know.
Yesterday, I dropped your toothbrush in the toilet.
All right, come on girls, let's go.
All we need are paper towels.
I'll get one.
Wait, hold it, Michelle.
Hold it, hold it, hold it.
- I'm just trying to help.
- Well, thank you.
But you never take from the bottom.
Always take from the top.
Like this, you see?
I could've done that.
I set the table, Uncle Jesse.
Thank you.
I'm too full to eat dinner, Uncle Jesse.
Now I know why they call them Funky Franks.
All right.
Michelle, take one plate away.
Now you see it, now you don't.
That's my laundry.
I'm gonna go check on the boys.
I'll be right back.
I threw D.J.'s sweater in.
I hope that mustard stain came out.
It shrank!
That won't fit my Barbie.
- Hi.
- Deej, my loving sister.
How nice to see you.
I'm just going to go in the living room and, oh, practice my moonwalk.
Steph, the '80s are over.
Oh, girls, just in time for dinner.
Oh, sorry, Uncle Jesse, but Kimmy and I are gonna go study at the library.
We'll catch a burger on the way.
Is that the thanks I get after slaving over a hot stove all day?
Boy, you sound just like my mom.
Only more bitter.
There goes another plate.
Hey, Jess.
Did you lose something?
Yeah, the use of my neck.
I tried to crack it myself.
You know, it's amazing how many people need shoeshines.
Where's Becky and Danny?
They said to tell you they had to work late and they'll be late for dinner.
Michelle two more plates.
Why do I even bother?
Well, I gotta go see a chiropractor so I'm not gonna be here for dinner either.
- Michelle: - What is this, a joke?
Jess, can you do me a favor and sew this button onto Mr. Woodchuck?
Oh, love to.
Boy, this floor needs a wax job.
Not only am I Mr. Mom, I'm Mr. Woodchuck's mom.
What a day.
Are you totally bummed?
Yeah, totally.
Go ahead, tell me all about it.
I'm just afraid, you know?
What if I never get a record deal?
I mean, is this it for me?
Cooking, cleaning, watching the kids while Becky's at work?
I gotta make some changes in my life.
Can we eat dinner first?
Sure, kid.
I hope you're hungry, because it's just you and me eating.
I think you forgot somebody.
Bon appÃ©tit, Comet.
All right, there.
Your button's on, you sawdust-sucking tree freak.
You have no snappy comebacks since Joey's hand's not up your back, huh?
That's what I thought.
- Hi, honey.
Hi.
- I'm sorry I missed dinner.
- That's okay.
Hello, boys.
I tell you, Jess, I know I should be happy about Vicky's new job in Chicago, and I am.
I'm feeling a little guilty that I'm not happy enough, you know?
I think I hid my feelings pretty well although I did weep all over her goodbye ice cream cake.
I'm fine about this, I really am.
Just.
Do you guys know a good therapist?
I'll be leaving now.
- He's taking it well.
- Yes, he is.
So, honey, how was your day?
Well, the record company called.
They didn't like my demo.
- Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry.
- That's all right.
I'm shaking things up.
I got myself a gig tonight.
I'm playing with an oldies band at the airport lounge.
The airport lounge?
Honey, isn't that a step down?
From unemployment?
No, it's music, it's a paycheck.
Besides, I get a real nice coloring book and those little wings.
Honey, I've been gone all day.
I mean, this was supposed to be our time together.
Well, this is my time to make some money for my family.
Jesse, I make more than enough money to support our family.
Thanks for reminding me.
You have some problem with me making a decent living?
I have a problem with me making a decent living.
So now I know what argument I'm in.
This is about your stubborn macho pride.
What pride?
I don't have any pride.
I lost my pride.
I'm going to get some pride.
Say goodbye to Mr. Donaldson.
Hey, Steph, have you seen the heating pad?
In Dad's top drawer.
You know he preheats his socks in the winter.
- How's your neck, Joey?
- Oh, it's much better.
I just can't make any sudden moves.
Look what fits me.
- Michelle!
- What?
Oh, I just threw my neck out again.
Way to go, stupid.
Hey, I have the exact same sweater in my closet.
Well, it's a small world after all.
And that one has a button missing right where this one has a button missing.
Can someone explain this?
I just wear them.
I don't shrink them.
Steph?
All right, this is your sweater.
I stole it, I stained it, I shrunk it.
I should've buried it.
Okay, D.J., have that cow.
I'm so sorry, D.J. I'll do anything to make it up to you.
Well, make it up to Kimmy.
I borrowed that sweater from her last summer.
Oh, yeah, that is my sweater.
So, Steph, you'll do anything to make it up to me?
This is my worst nightmare.
Okay, Kimmy, I deserve this.
What do you want?
Well, actually I haven't had a pedicure in my whole life.
Ew, gross.
Not the sock!
Run for it!
Thank you, and do you know what?
Thank you.
Well, welcome to the terminal lounge, the hippest room on the departing level.
We are The Diplomats and no, you're not in an elevator.
Thank you, Irv, I love you.
What are you guys doing here?
Well, we thought we'd come down to see you.
I thought you said this was an oldies band.
I get it.
Talk to you after the set.
MAN : Flight 19 to Chicago is now boarding at gate six.
Hey, buddy what are you staring at?
Oh, I'm not staring, I just have a stiff neck.
You want me to adjust it for you?
I'll just adjust my chair.
Okay, for our next number, we have a-- Oh, yes, sir, you have a request?
Yes, sir, what would you like to hear?
Watch my luggage while I go to the john.
Who wrote that one?
Gershwin?
Hit me, Irv.
Okay.
Well, then, we'll do this song.
I'm sure you'll all enjoy it.
It goes something like this.
Vicky, I can't believe you're moving to Chicago.
Danny, I've been thinking about this all day.
I'm gonna take that job here doing the weather.
Really?
That's great.
But wait a minute.
Vicky, what about Chicago?
That was your dream job.
But San Francisco has one thing Chicago doesn't.
Rice-A-Roni?
All right, two things.
Vicky, I can't let you give up your dream for me.
If you stay here and do the weather, you're gonna hate it.
And then pretty soon, you're gonna start to hate me.
I could never hate you.
I may resent you a little.
MAN : Final boarding for flight 19 to Chicago.
Vicky, you've gotta get on that plane or you're gonna regret it.
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.
You're right.
Oh, Danny, I'm gonna miss you.
I'm gonna miss you too.
Goodbye, sweetheart.
MAN : Flight 17 to Reno, now available for preboarding.
I can't do it.
Vicky, you need to be strong.
No, I can't do it because I don't have luggage or a ticket.
I have to go through this whole goodbye again tomorrow?
Yes but we'll always have the terminal lounge.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
We're gonna take a short break but I bet you won't even know we're gone.
MAN : Passenger Wilson, please pick up the white courtesy phone.
Passenger Wilson.
Well.
Hey, Jess, I really like the new band.
They really make you look young.
- Do me a favor.
Point me to the restroom.
- Sure.
Jess, honey, is this really what you wanna do?
No, this is what I have to do.
Sing "Glow Worm" in an airport lounge?
I'll admit it's not the coolest gig in the world, but it's still music.
And you gotta admit, Irv is one bad mama in his own right.
Jess, what about your music?
You can't give up on that.
I'm not giving up on my music.
And if I get lucky, you know, it'll be great, I'll get a shot.
Right now, I gotta contribute to my family.
But you do contribute.
You're a great husband, you're a great father.
I'm talking about money.
Whether I make a million dollars or $1, I can't just let you go to work and make all the money for this family.
I'm a man.
Maybe I'm old-fashioned, but that's who I am.
And that's who I love.
Sweetie, I'm really sorry if I hurt your feelings.
And if you think it's important to be a Diplomat then I back you 100 percent.
Thank you.
What's important is the "tuneage" in this joint.
We gotta work on the playlist.
All right, Dips.
You guys, come on.
Now, I know deep, deep down inside you there's gotta be some kind of wild rock 'n' roll maniac dying to get out.
All right, we'll fake it.
A little rock 'n' roll music in E. Shall we, fellas?
Here we go.
That's it, swing with it, boys.
Swing it.
Irv, hit me, babe.
Hit me, Irv.
That's it.
Oh, my neck.
I'm cured.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
- Now could we lick the spatula?
- No, not yet.
Stephanie's birthday cake has to be perfect, so keep frosting.
Now could we lick the spatula?
Yes, now we can lick the spatula.
It's about time.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Michelle.
Michelle, now we have to make some more frosting.
Gee, what a shame.
Okay, let's see, it's Friday, right?
That means I clean the baby bottles, and you clean the baby bottoms.
Hey, there's my two biggest fans.
Boy, Rock, I gotta get more sleep.
I'm seeing double.
Oh, would you look at that?
I got them laughing again.
Well, Joey, don't get too excited.
They crack up at anything.
Yeah, yesterday I blew my nose, they busted a gut.
I'll make them laugh.
Hello, I'm Michelle-winkle.
I said, I'm Michelle-winkle.
Get it?
Hey, what's your problem?
This is funny stuff.
Don't worry, sweetie, I think they're just tired.
- Boys, you need your beauty sleep.
- You mean "ruggedly handsome" sleep.
Oh, yeah, right.
Ruggedly handsome.
- Say goodbye, Uncle Joey.
- Bye.
I wanna be funny like you.
No problem at all, Michelle.
Welcome to Joey Gladstone's Comedy College.
You'll have those babies laughing so hard there won't be a dry diaper in the house.
Ha-ha-ha!
Not a bad power-laugh.
A little more power, less laugh.
Ha-ha-ha!
Ha-ha!
- Hey, not bad.
Ha-ha!
There you go.
Come on, Dad.
Please take me to your show today.
I gotta meet Tommy Page.
Maybe he'll autograph his picture.
I'll try to get him to sign it, but you cannot cut school - because a rock star's on my show.
- He's not just any rock star.
His poster's hanging over my bed.
He's the last thing I see before I fall asleep.
Except the inside of my eyelids.
This is so cute.
Stephanie's first childhood crush.
You know, I had the same thing with George Michael.
Until his earrings got bigger than mine.
I am not a child.
Today is my 10th birthday.
The big 1-0.
Dad, I can't believe you wouldn't let your own daughter meet her all-time, favorite singer in the whole universe on her birthday.
And I thought you loved me.
Great guilt trip.
Thanks.
Did it work?
No.
I'm losing my touch.
Okay, get out of here and have fun at school.
You know, Dad, that was pretty cold.
I mean, it is her birthday, and she does worship the guy.
Look, I'm gonna tell you something, but you gotta keep it a secret.
I told Tommy what a big fan Stephanie is and he agreed to stop by her party after school today.
Dad, Stephanie's gonna go nuts.
I know.
Am I the raddest, baddest dad a kid ever had?
You were until you said that.
Here you go, boys.
Wow!
Say yo, yo, yo!
This is Joey-Joe Badstone at Stephanie Tanner's pumping up the jams and jamming up the pumps, you know what I'm saying.
Yeah, hey, neither do I. All right, everybody, party.
Uncle Jesse, none of the boys will dance.
Well, all right, I'll help you out here.
All right, fellas, listen up.
Now, I realize you guys might be a little shy around women.
You know, you're wondering if you're over-moussed, under- deodorized.
I know how you feel.
You mean, you were shy around girls?
No, what am I, a dork?
Go ask them to dance.
No!
Girls, all right, it's ladies' choice.
Grab your favorite guy and go for it.
Ho-ho-ho-ho!
Not me.
The little ones.
Ew!
Where's Tommy Page?
Tell him his love slave is ready to fulfill his every wish.
D.J., why did you tell Kimmy?
Because I tell Kimmy everything.
Okay, then tell her to go home.
No can do, Mr. T. I saw Tommy's limo outside.
Now, where are you hiding that hunkalicious boy toy?
He's waiting downstairs.
Freeze, Gibbler, I need him in one piece.
Now, look, right now I want the two of you to go out there and tell Jesse and Joey that we're ready, all right?
And, Kimmy, please, don't do anything to embarrass us.
I'll be a perfect lady, until I see Tommy.
Then you'll have to hose me down.
Tommy.
D.J.: Joey, he's ready.
All right.
Everybody, please move back.
Stephanie, please have a seat right here, honey.
Sweetheart, this is my special gift from me to you.
Tommy Page!
Happy birthday, Stephanie.
- Thanks.
- Happy birthday, sweetheart.
Dad, he's the best birthday present ever.
Can I keep him?
Deej, you can let go now.
I'll be cool.
Tommy!
- Hello.
- Hi.
I'm Stephanie's best friend, Kimmy Gibbler.
Can I have your autograph?
Just sign it, "To Kimmy, the woman of my dreams".
Kimmy, he writes music, not science fiction.
No, look, it's no problem.
- Where do you want me to sign it?
- Oh, here, autograph my shoe.
Ew!
Okay, that's enough.
- But wait a minute, he didn't sign it yet.
- That's fine, everything's beautiful.
Tommy, I've never seen that woman before in my life.
Thanks so much for coming.
Uh, would you sign my CD?
You're the birthday girl.
Thanks, be right back.
Don't move.
Watch him till I get back.
Thanks for your help on the piano.
Really sounded great.
It was my pleasure, thank you.
You know, I-- I dabble in music myself there, Tom.
You heard of my band, Jesse and the Rippers?
Yeah, didn't you play in Seattle this summer?
Yes, we did, yes.
Played a little club near the university over there.
Oh, cool, yeah, I was playing at the Kingdome.
Kingdome, that's nice.
If you're into, you know, big stadiums and a lot of money.
I prefer to play the small, intimate places where I can split a pizza with my audience.
If you'll excuse us.
Hi, Tommy.
My name is Michelle.
Well, hi, Michelle.
It's really nice to meet you.
My birthday's in November.
Start working on my song.
- You're funny.
- I'm in comedy college.
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Hi, I'm Stephanie's sister, D.J. Is this your first time in San Francisco?
Yeah, but I haven't had the chance to see anything.
You should go down to Chinatown and Fisherman's Wharf.
Maybe you could show me around tomorrow.
Me?
I'd love to.
I'm back, I'm back, I'm back.
Sorry I took so long.
Whoa, Steph, how many gallons of perfume did you put on?
I just put on one little dab.
On every inch of my body.
Could you sign this?
I'll treasure it forever.
Sure.
"To Stephanie.
Love, Tommy".
There you go.
Which sounds better, Comet?
Mrs. Tommy Page?
Stephanie Page?
Stephanie Tanner Page?
Or Mrs. Stephanie Judith Tanner Page?
No, Comet, you don't get a belly rub until we decide what's going on these wedding invitations.
Hey, thanks for a great day, Tommy.
I never ate tacos in a limo before.
Actually, I've never been in a limo before.
Yeah, I figured that out when you went to go sit up in the front seat with the chauffeur.
Do you wanna come to my concert tonight?
I can get you backstage passes.
Yeah, that would be great.
Great, well, I gotta go downstairs, Jesse's waiting for me.
I promised Stephanie I'd make her a tape of that song.
Well, thanks for a really great day.
I'll see you later.
Yes.
Okay, Alex, Nicky, I'm gonna teach you your first word.
Are you ready?
Mommy.
Mommy.
Nicky, Alex, get ready to laugh because here comes the first graduate of Joey Gladstone's Comedy College.
Michelle "Shecky" Tanner.
Boy, do I got a headache.
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Maybe you didn't see this arrow in my head.
Joey, I'm dying out here.
Well, Michelle, maybe you should just go to your big finish.
Do I have to do this?
Mm-hm.
Everybody knows that a pie in the face is the oldest joke in the book.
But we also know that it always gets a laugh.
- Okay, let me have it.
- Okay.
Are you ready?
I'm ready.
I did it.
I am funny!
Michelle, I'm supposed to throw the pie in your face.
This was funnier.
Well, just for that, you get a big sloppy kiss.
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
- Hi, Steph.
- Hello.
Aunt Becky, can we talk woman to woman?
Sure, but I thought you'd be downstairs listening to Tommy record your song.
This is more important.
What would you do if another woman stole Uncle Jesse from you?
That would never happen because your Uncle Jesse and I have a loving and committed relationship based on mutual trust and respect.
She'd never know what hit her.
Got it, Aunt Becky.
She's toast.
Whoa, wait a minute.
Is this about a boy at your party?
Well, yeah, sort of.
He really liked me but another woman stole my man right out from under my nose.
The scuzz-queen.
You're kidding.
So who is this scuzz-queen?
Well, she was like a sister to me.
But not anymore.
I'm gonna win him back.
There's nothing wrong with letting him know why you're the one he should be with.
Right, and if that doesn't work, she's toast.
I know he's here.
Where'd you stash him?
Tommy's in the studio recording.
But I can't go down until the red light's off.
All right, Tanner, I want details.
What happened with you and Tommy?
Before or after he kissed me?
No.
You were lip wrestling with the stud puppy?
I am so happy for you.
Now mind if I take a crack at him?
Yes, I mind.
He's not running a kissing booth.
We're starting a real relationship.
Hey, it was worth a shot.
Well, good luck, Deej.
When that red light goes off, it's a green light for love.
All right, good job.
Come on out.
That was nice of you to write that song for Stephanie.
Thanks, but I gotta be honest.
I didn't write it for Stephanie.
I wrote it for my girlfriend, Melanie.
I just changed all the Melanies to Stephanies.
Do me a favor, don't mention it to Stephanie.
Do me a favor, don't mention it to Melanie.
Just happened to see the red light go off.
Not that I was waiting for the red light to go off, because I have a life.
But since the light did go off, thought I'd come down and see why.
- Oh, hi, Tommy.
- Hi, D.J. - Oh, hi, Tommy.
- Oh, hi, Stephanie.
Oh, that's right.
I'm the invisible uncle, I forgot.
I'm gonna get a drink.
What do you want, Tommy?
- Ice tea, lemon, no sugar.
- Ice tea, lemon, no sugar.
Say the magic word, "Tommy," and bada bing, I'm back in the room.
I got the party pictures back.
Here's a nice one of us, suitable for framing.
Steph, don't you have something to do?
Don't you worry your pretty little pointed head about me.
I don't think Tommy wants to look at pictures of a 10-year-old's birthday party.
No, it's okay.
No, D.J.'s right.
You'd probably rather look at pictures of her.
- Hm?
- What pictures?
Here's one of D.J. when she had the mumps.
Doesn't she remind you of Mr. Potato Head?
Give me that.
- Here's my favorite: D.J.'s first bath.
- Oh!
- You're dead.
- And in this one - you can see a little rash on her fanny.
- Yeah, check it out.
That's it.
Excuse us, but I would like to have a little chat with my sister.
No, that's okay.
I don't really feel like chatting.
I do, now.
Don't worry, Tommy, I'll be right back.
No, she won't, I promise.
Stephanie, how could you do this to me?
What about what you did to me, you backstabbing, boyfriend-stealing traitor?
What?
You thought Tommy was your boyfriend?
- You're dreaming.
- He was too my boyfriend.
- Girls-- - And he's gonna dump you and come back to me after he finds out you drool in your sleep.
I do not.
Yes, you do, and I have the picture to prove it.
- Hey-- - Where did you get that?
You didn't know I took this, did you?
I knew it would come in handy.
- All right.
- Give me that, you little worm.
Girls.
Girls.
- What's this all about?
- I don't know, but there they go.
- Girls.
D.J. - Come on.
Give me that.
Hey, Jesse, what is going on here?
Next time you bring a star home, try Angela Lansbury.
Stephanie thinks Tommy is her boyfriend.
She's showing him embarrassing pictures of me.
He was too my boyfriend till you stole him.
- You're insane.
- I am not insane.
He signed my CD, "Love, Tommy".
He signed my CD, "Love, Tommy".
But he wrote a special song just for me.
And he kissed me.
I love him, and he loves me.
Look, Steph, I know you feel very strongly about this and I don't mean to hurt your feelings, but I don't think this is really love.
I think it's just a crush, you know?
Steph, your dad's right.
You know, when it's really love, your-- Your heart starts pounding and-- And your toes curl, and you start sweating-- Well, this isn't it.
Hey, Steph?
Look, we all know what you're going through, okay?
And sometimes you wish for something so badly that you start believing it's true.
Yeah, Steph, face reality.
Tommy was just being nice.
He's not in love with you.
He's in love with me.
What?
When did this happen?
You just met him.
Well, I know we only spent a couple hours together and it's true we haven't talked about commitment yet but I think it's getting pretty serious.
You know that nice little talk we just had with Stephanie?
Now I think we're gonna have that talk with you.
Dad, Stephanie is a child.
I am a woman.
Is it safe for me to come up yet?
Tommy, would you please straighten everybody out about what's going on between us?
Well, D.J. and I had a really fun day, and I hope that we can be good friends.
Friends?
You mean, just friends?
Yeah.
I'm sorry if you misunderstood.
Well, now that she's out of the way, I guess it's just you and me, Thomas.
Stephanie, I wanna be friends with you too.
You mean friends like you're just friends with D.J.?
Uh-huh.
But you wrote "Love, Tommy" on my CD.
I always write, "Love, Tommy".
Sometimes I'll even forget and I'll write it for a guy.
Yeah, you-- You gotta watch that.
Look, I didn't mean to cause any trouble.
I hope you'll still come to my concert tonight, okay?
- I gotta go.
Nice meeting you all.
- Nice meeting you.
- Thanks for this.
- Thanks a lot.
Thanks a lot, Tommy.
Tommy, are you leaving?
Yeah, but it was really great meeting you, Michelle.
Wow, you are such a babe.
Thanks.
Goodbye.
I'm gonna marry him.
Oh, man, it never ends.
Can I help you?
Well, I thought if I'm miserable and you're miserable we might as well be miserable together.
Sit.
Be miserable.
I was so dumb.
I was so sure he liked me.
At least you didn't make up wedding invitations.
You know what the weirdest part is?
Everything Dad, Joey, and Uncle Jesse said was right.
I hate when that happens.
If this was just a crush, I don't know if I can take it when I really fall in love.
What's that gonna feel like?
I don't know.
I don't think I've ever really been in love before.
But I hear it's pretty intense.
I hear the same thing.
You know what I just realized?
I am sitting here talking to you about love and boys.
Steph, you're really growing up.
I must be.
Because ever since I turned 10, life got so complicated.
Well, one day we are gonna be dating like crazy and I want you to know that I will never ever steal one of your boyfriends.
Because guys are gonna come, and guys are gonna go but you and I will be sisters forever.
Sisters forever.
And I want every one of those embarrassing pictures back.
You got them.
- And the negatives.
- We'll talk.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
And now for your bedtime story.
The Cat in the Hat, by Dr. Seuss.
Excuse me, why is it called The Cat in the Hat?
Because it wouldn't have the same ring to it if it was The Cat in the Vest.
Very interesting.
Now let's begin our story.
The sun did not shine.
Excuse me, how come the sun didn't shine?
Because it was raining.
Very, very interesting.
It was too wet to play.
So we sat in the house All that cold, cold wet day.
Excuse me, what day of the week was it?
Excuse me, I just figured out your little plan.
You were asking me questions after every sentence so I'll be reading you this story for the next two hours and you will never go to sleep.
You're pretty smart, Michelle.
You're pretty smart too.
Check this out, boys.
Daddy's cookies.
Have a little whiff, there you go.
Times like this I bet you wish you guys had teeth, huh?
Come on, you guys wanna swing?
Let's swing.
Here we go.
- Hey, Jess.
Hi, Danny.
- Cookies, I'll get the milk.
- Hi, my boys.
Hi.
Hi, sweetie.
Oh, look at that, gingerbread men.
Oh, not just gingerbread men.
I have a whole gingerbread family.
See, you got your gingerbread Rebecca.
Isn't she a fox?
Have mercy.
Your gingerbread Danny.
Notice the resemblance there.
Nose and the whole--  And, of course, your gingerbread Joey.
There you go.
Why am I bald?
Sorry, Joey, I used the last bit of frosting on my hair.
- You better get a record deal real soon.
- Yeah.
Well, in the meantime, I may have a job for you.
I need a song to introduce cartoons on The Ranger Joe Show.
I need something snappy.
Would you do it?
Would you do it?
Would you?
Would you?
Would you?
Joey, I don't do snappy.
You get a royalty every time they play your song.
- Call me Mr. Snappy.
- Hi.
How's it going?
Good.
- Gingerbread cookies.
How was school?
I have big, big news.
Milk coming your way.
Michelle, look at this.
- I have big news, people.
Michelle, wait.
I don't want you to spoil your dinner, honey.
Thank you.
As I was saying, I have big, big news.
I'm talking large, I'm talking huge I'm talking massively gigundo.
You're talking too much.
What is it?
You are looking at the spelling-bee champion of Mr. Lowry's fourth grade class.
- Steph, that's wonderful.
- Congratulations.
Honey, could you get down?
You're getting the seat cushion dirty.
Wait, there's more news.
This Friday, I'm in the finals for best speller in the fourth grade.
That's terrific, Steph.
If you make best in school, you go on to the city and then the state, and then you could become the national champion.
We could all meet the president.
Dad, calm down.
I'm never gonna beat Davey Chu.
He's the smartest kid in school.
They call him the human dictionary.
Whoa, I don't wanna hear that kind of negative attitude.
If you wanna be a winner, you gotta think like a winner.
That's right.
Listen up, human dictionary Stephanie Tanner is gonna tear you vowel from vowel and eat your consonants for lunch.
Grr!
You're right.
Davey Chu, prepare to be pulverized.
P-U-L-V-E-R-I-Z-E-D.
Pulverized.
Grr!
- Very good.
- Steph, you're gonna do great.
- You've been reading since you were 4.
- Hey, I'm 5.
How come I can't read?
Not everyone starts to read at the same age.
I'm sure you'll read very soon.
I wanna read right now.
Michelle, where are you going with my paper?
To the bathroom.
That's where Joey reads.
Gentlemen, may I present the Ranger Joe cartoon theme song in C major.
Jesse Katsopolis, composer.
Giddyup, giddyup Giddyup and go Here's another great cartoon From Ranger Joe Yee-haw!
- What'd you think?
- Totally wrong.
What?
Totally wrong?
What--?
What was the guns and the thing and the spinning?
Jess, it just doesn't have that childlike quality I'm looking for.
Childlike?
Joseph, kids loved it.
Look at these kids.
I mean, look at their faces, they're elated.
I need something a little more cartoony, something like:  It's time for another cartoon I'll tell you what, I'll lend you a videotape of my favorite cartoons.
In no time at all, you'll be  a cartoon aficionado.
Thanks.
I'm so excited.
Hello, my beautiful daughter Michelle.
We're gonna use this superduper letter board to help you to learn to read.
I know how to read.
Watch.
The sun did not shine.
It was too wet to play.
Actually, sweetheart what you were reading on that page there says: "Copyright 1957".
How come you never read that part?
Michelle, I think it's wonderful that you wanna learn to read books but you can't just memorize what I read to you every night.
Why not?
Because it'll start to catch up with you around college.
Let's start off by learning the sound of each letter, okay?
- Like A is for-- - Apple.
That's right.
But I have a system that is gonna make learning to read even more fun.
Okay?
This is Daddy's special system.
A is for Ajax.
B is for Brillo.
C, Clorox.
It's gone!
Gone, gone, gone!
- What's gone?
- My brain.
The spelling bee's tomorrow, and I can't remember how to spell "success".
How many C's and how many S's?
And where the heck do they go?
Steph, get a grip.
You're a winner, remember?
All you need is a mnemonic device.
What the heck is that?
It must be for cleaning.
No, a mnemonic device is a little trick I have to help you remember.
Like take the word "success".
What you do is double the C double the S and you will always have success, got it?
Double the C, double the S. - S-U-C-C-E-S-S.
Success.
- That's right.
If you're having any trouble with words, a mnemonic device will help you.
Davey Chu's gonna wish he never learned the alphabet.
I can spell "alphabet".
Well, the word "alphabet" is in there someplace.
Okay, sweetheart, ready?
D is for Drano.
Here comes Stephanie.
Doesn't she look smart?
Of course she does.
Intelligence runs in our family.
It must have skipped a generation.
You left the lens cap on.
Boy, that trophy's gonna look nice in my bedroom.
Only if I let you borrow it.
You're going down, Chu.
And it's all thanks to two little words: mnemonic device.
Dream on, Tanner.
They don't call me the human dictionary because I'm good at kickball.
Good afternoon, parents, students and friends.
Welcome to the fourth-grade spelling championship.
Now I'd like to introduce the top spellers in the fourth grade.
Frannie Weisberg.
Randy Gaines.
Davey Chu.
And our first speller, Stephanie Tanner.
- Yeah!
All right, Steph!
- Go get them, Steph!
Stephanie, your first word is "mnemonic".
Mnemonic.
- Would you repeat the word, please?
- The word is "mnemonic".
And a very fine word it is.
Uh, mnemonic.
A device or trick to help you remember things.
Mnemonic.
Stephanie, this is not a definition bee.
I need the spelling.
Spelling?
Oh, I'll give you spelling.
Rhododendron.
R-H-O-D-O-D-E-N-D-R-O-N.
Rhododendron.
You have 10 seconds to spell "mnemonic".
Mnemonic.
N-E-M-O-N-I-C.
Mnemonic.
- Yes!
- Yeah!
Great, honey.
Uh, I'm afraid that's incorrect, Stephanie.
The next speller is Davey Chu.
Mnemonic.
M-N-E-M-O-N-I-C.
Mnemonic.
Correct.
Now, that eliminates Stephanie Tanner.
Thank you, Stephanie.
What?
That's it?
I did all that studying for one lousy word?
Come on, have a heart.
Give me a do-over.
Do-over.
- Do-over.
Do-over.
Please, can I have another chance?
Any other word.
Any other word.
I'm sorry, Stephanie.
You can take your seat with the class, sweetheart.
All right.
Okay, our next speller is Randy Gaines.
Randy, your first word is "incandescent".
Incandescent.
I-N-C-A-N-D-E-S-C-E-N-T.
Stephanie, sweetheart, you've already been eliminated.
Eliminated.
E-L-I-M-I-N-A-T-E-D.
Eliminated.
D.J., D.J., come here!
Michelle, what is it?
Look.
I can read your name, "D.J." Michelle, that's very good.
Do you wanna try something a little harder?
Sure.
I heard this was good.
Let's hold off on The Hobbit.
Have a seat.
Let's start with this word.
- Now, do you know what this says?
- That's my name.
"Michelle".
But do you know why it says "Michelle"?
I have no idea.
Well, let's start with the M. Do you know what sound that makes?
Like Mop & Glo.
I see you've been studying with Dad.
Now for the I. Do you know what sound that makes?
Piece of cake.
I is like "eye".
Well, not exactly.
That "eye" starts with an E. It sounds like an I, but it isn't.
But the I in your name doesn't sound like the "eye" that starts with the E. It sounds like I as in "it".
If you say so.
You see, Michelle, vowels have long sounds and short sounds.
And if the vowel is long it says its own name.
A, E, I, O, U. If the vowel is short, it has a different sound.
"Ah," "eh," "ih," "ah," and "a".
Huh?
Right, just like "huh".
However, a short vowel can be changed into a long vowel if the word has a silent E, like the word "date".
If you take off that E the word becomes "dat".
But that's a really bad example because "dat" is not a real word.
I'm never gonna learn how to read.
I guess I didn't help much, did I?
Duh.
"Mnemonic" has a silent M?
Who ever heard of a silent M?
Silent K, yeah, maybe.
But silent M--  Steph, hold it right there.
We have to talk about this.
Is Stephanie home?
She forgot her ribbon.
Steph, would you look at that?
Davey brought you your ribbon.
Hot dog.
Mind if I put this trophy down?
It's really heavy.
That trophy would be mine if they didn't give me the one word I didn't know.
Davey, what Steph means to say is congratulations.
What I mean is I can outspell him any time.
Come on, Chu.
Right here, right now.
If you beat me again, I'll carry your lunch tray for a week.
- Books too?
- Books too.
- And buy me ice cream?
- Don't push it.
Okay, you're on.
You sure you wanna do this?
This guy knew how to spell "ecclesiastical".
Ecclesiastical.
E-C-C-L-E-S-I-A-S-T-I-C-A-L.
Ecclesiastical.
All right.
Let the games begin.
I'll get the dictionary.
- Hey, Jess.
- Hey.
How's my theme song?
Did you come up with anything like:  It's time for another cartoon Joseph, I've spent a couple hours watching your favorite cartoons and came up with a very important conclusion.
You're a sick man.
But I did come up with a perfect song.
I programmed sound effects in this, and I think you're gonna love it.
- Listen to this.
Goes like this.
- Great.
Okay, all right.
Oh, look out  Duck  Crash and ka-boom  Here comes another Ranger Joe cartoon  ROAD RUNNER'S VOICE : Beep, beep!
Huh?
Huh?
Now, now, now, Jess, I wanna say this nicely.
I hate it.
Hate, what?
Hate is such a strong word.
What do you--?
What do you want?
Something stupid like:  Here comes another cartoon  - That's it.
- What's it?
That note, that "boing," whatever you hit.
That's perfect.
Jess, you are a musical genius.
That's my theme song.
What are you talking about?
That's the stupid song you've been singing.
I didn't write that, you wrote that.
You gonna pay me for that?
You're right.
I did write that.
Hey, thanks for trying.
Ho-ho-ho-ho!
Wait a minute!
What about my:  Huh, Joseph?
Didn't that just--?
You owe me, Gladstone.
Without thatyou got nothing!
B-E-N-I-G-N.
Benign.
That's correct.
Okay, Steph, it's your word.
- "Trigonometry".
- Trigonometry.
T-R-I-G-O-N-O-M-E-T-R-Y.
Trigonometry.
Yes!
That's my girl.
I mean, correct.
Okay, Davey, spell "photosynthesis".
Hey, Michelle, how's your reading coming?
I quit.
I'm too dumb to read.
Hey, now, that kind of talk stops right here, young lady.
Come here, I wanna talk to you.
Now if anyone knows about being dumb, it's your Uncle Jesse.
Hey, let me go back and rephrase that.
See, when I was in first grade there were two kind of reading groups.
There were the Bluebirds and the Robins.
And I was a Robin and everyone knew the Robins were kind of slow readers so I thought that meant I was dumb.
So instead of spending my time trying to learn to read I spent all my time beating up the Bluebirds.
- So you're dumb like me?
- No, I wasn't dumb.
That's the point I'm trying to make.
I thought I was dumb so I gave up trying.
I mean, I got bad grades for a long time and then I realized that I'm a smart guy.
I won't let the same thing happen to you, because you're a smart girl.
Oh, please.
Oh, please, yourself.
Now, to start reading, all you have to learn is one really cool word, okay?
And I'm gonna teach it to you right now.
You ready?
Here is the word.
Okay, now, in this word, the A sounds like "ah".
Here we go again.
You just stick with your Uncle J, okay?
The A sounds like "ah".
And the T sounds like what?
What sound does the T make?
"Tuh".
That's right, "tuh".
Okay, now put them together and what do you get?
"Ah-tuh".
"Ah-tuh".
"Ah-tuh".
- At.
- That's it.
At.
You just read "at".
I did?
Yeah, you did.
It's great.
Now, what sound does the letter C make?
"Ca," like Clorox.
I see your dad's been teaching you.
All right.
Now, here we go.
"Ca" and "at," put them together, what do you get?
"Ca-at".
- Faster.
- "Ca-at".
Cat.
I read "cat".
She just read another word, ladies and gentlemen.
This chick is on fire.
Reading high-fives.
Can you dig it?
I knew that you could.
All right.
Let's try another one.
The ever-popular H. Okay?
What does that say?
"Ha-at".
- Hat.
- All right.
I did it again.
I'm unbelievable.
Yes!
I'm so proud of you.
That's terrific.
We'll just read a little each day and before you know it you're gonna be reading a book, I promise.
- Which book?
- Well, here-- Hey, this is the perfect one.
Now, watch.
Now, when I point to a word, you say it, okay?
- "The".
- "Cat".
- "In the".
- "Hat".
Right on, sister.
What are you--?
You can't tickle me!
E-P-I-P-H-A-N-Y.
Epiphany.
That's correct.
Stephanie, I'm sorry, I gotta go home for dinner.
Hey, if you quit, you forfeit, Chumeister.
Dad, next word, please.
This is gonna be the last word, all right?
"Sarsaparilla".
Sarsaparilla.
S-A-S-P-A-R-I-L-L-A.
Sarsaparilla.
I'm sorry, Steph.
Why?
Because it's sarsaparilla.
S-A-R-S-A-P-A-R-I-L-L-A.
Sarsaparilla.
Man, that's right.
You are the human dictionary, aren't you?
Now there's a silent R?
I hate this language.
- Steph.
- I gotta go home for dinner.
Well, Mr. Tanner, I must say it's been quite a delectation.
Yeah, certainly has.
"Delectation".
Better not be a putdown.
Steph?
I'm really disappointed in you.
I know.
You said I was a winner, but let's face it, I'm a loser.
I'm not disappointed in you because you lost.
I'm disappointed because of the way you lost.
- Honey, you were a sore loser.
- That's because I hate losing.
Nobody likes to lose.
But everybody loses sometimes.
You did your best, tried your hardest, and Davey beat you fair and square.
Why didn't you congratulate him?
Because I was mad.
Were you mad at him for winning or mad at yourself for losing?
- Do I have to answer that?
- Yeah.
I guess I was mad at myself.
I just wanted to be the best.
You are.
You're the best speller in your class.
You might even be the best speller in this house.
- Dad.
- Okay, you are the best speller in this house.
Sweetheart, you have to be proud of your accomplishments.
But no matter how good you are at something there always may be a Davey Chu out there who might be just a little bit better than you are.
It's just as important to be a good loser as it is to be a good winner, honey.
You're right.
I'm sorry, Dad.
I can't wait till I lose again so I can show you how good I am at it.
Now you're talking like a winner.
Come here.
Aww.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
- I'll get it.
- We'll both get it.
One moment, please.
I'll be right with you.
Daddy, there's a monkey at the door.
That's gotta be my sister.
Your sister is a monkey?
Excuse me.
- Surprise.
- Hey, hey, hey, Wendy.
- Hi.
- You're back.
Girls, it's Aunt Wendy and her monkey.
- Look at the monkey.
- Wait a second.
Is it safe - for the kids to be near the monkey?
- Absolutely.
She's very tame.
I raised her all by myself from a little baby.
I was studying chimpanzees in Uganda and I found poor Ginger all by herself.
Everybody wave hi to Ginger.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Girls, give your Aunt Wendy a hug.
Hi.
- Hi.
Come on, let's sit down.
I wanna hear everything.
Hey, come on, Ginger, let's have a seat.
Dad, we gotta get a monkey.
Honey, you know the rule.
No jungle animals in the house.
Hey, Ginger, can you do a monkey face?
Not bad.
Try a chicken.
What's going on here?
Ho-ho-ho!
A monkey, a girl with blond hair.
It's gotta be the jungle girl.
- Hi.
- How you doing?
Nice to see you.
Nice to see you.
This is my wife, Rebecca.
This is Wendy, Danny's little sister.
It's nice to finally meet you.
- That's Ginger.
- Oh-ho-ho!
Hi, Ginger.
Listen, she's got her hand in my pocket.
What's her hand doing in my pocket?
I mean, I know what it's doing in my pocket but I mean, why is she doing it?
That's amazing.
Ginger's usually so shy with strangers.
She must really like you.
Oh, goody.
Oh-ho-ho!
Okay, that's enough of that, Ginger.
Oh, yeah, okay.
Nice to meet you.
How you d--?
Oh, okay, yeah.
All right, listen, I'm not a. I'm not really a monkey type of guy.
Thank you.
- Is this thing tame?
- Yes, she's very well-mannered.
Oh.
And I think she has the hots for my husband.
Hey, Ginger, he's mine.
All right.
Jess, I just cleaned the coffee table.
Could somebody slide a coaster under her or something?
Danny, if you're that worried about Ginger, maybe I should get a hotel.
Don't you be silly.
I wouldn't have it.
You're gonna stay here with me.
Ginger can get a hotel.
- Hey.
- Joey, look who's here.
Oh, my goodness, Wendy Tanner, you little cutie.
You have not changed one bit.
Very funny, Joey.
I'm just kidding.
Come on, give me a hug.
Why, so you can stick a sardine down my back?
I haven't pulled that bit since I was in eighth grade.
If you're so worried about it, just give me a little handshake.
Oh, yes.
- Yes.
You can go home again.
- Joey, that was so lame.
Sorry, I saw you coming so I grabbed the nearest fake hand I could find.
That's it, Joey.
Wanna pick up right where we left off?
Fine.
I'm calling your mom.
See if I even care, see if I even care.
Okay, would you guys just call it a truce, please?
All right, let's shake on it for real.
Come on, Danny.
We got a lot of catching up to do.
I have a job interview at 3 at the zoo.
Think you could give me a ride?
You know, I'd love to, but I gotta tape some promos.
Joey, do me a favor.
Why don't you take Wendy and maybe you can get across town without playing a trick on her.
Okay.
Well, you better hold my sneezing powder my whoopee cushion and my exploding tuna.
What are you doing in my lap?
What, do I look like Santa Claus?
Somebody's got a monkey crush.
Oh!
I got two words for you: banana Binaca.
Not the hair.
Watch the hair.
Look what just got delivered.
It's addressed to Tanner.
Rip that sucker open.
Michelle, I don't know if this package is for me.
But there's only one way to find out.
What the heck is that?
I bet it's from Africa.
It says, "I am Nikata.
Feed me or a curse will be brought upon your household.
Enjoy".
What's a curse?
It's a magic spell that brings a bunch of bad luck.
Then we better feed him.
Michelle, there's no such thing as magic spells or curses so we're not gonna have any bad luck.
Hey, squirtarinos.
Gibbler's here.
That's very bad luck.
True, but it's not Nikata's fault, it's D.J.'s.
Listen, you guys.
Kimmy and I are doing beauty makeovers so the bathroom is off-limits for the next three hours.
You're gonna need three years for Kimmy.
Don't hate me because I'm beautiful.
This guy is making me nervous.
Michelle, nothing bad is gonna happen.
He's just a silly block of wood.
MALE  Feed me.
You heard the man, feed him.
And five and six and seven and eight.
- One.
- And one and two - Two.
- and three and four and five.
Three.
Come on, Beck, how trendy can you get?
Baby aerobics?
Jess, it'll help the boys develop their motor skills.
They'll crawl earlier, walk sooner who knows, maybe even potty train faster.
Double time.
And one and two, and one and two.
Okay, okay, I think we've had enough.
Yes, we have.
Come on, boys, time to hit the showers.
Yes, come to Mommy.
Go to Mommy when you're crying.
Go see Mommy.
There you go.
Oh, crying babies.
Oh, great, the zoo crew is back.
- I think somebody missed somebody.
- Yeah, okay.
Okay, listen.
Look, Ginger.
I hate to break it to you, but it's over, all right?
I'm a happily married man.
There's nothing going on between you and me.
All right, okay.
All right, listen.
Listen, listen here.
Now, look, I can't hang out with you, you know.
You wanna find a playmate?
Go find Michael Jackson.
I don't wanna hurt your feelings.
You're a beautiful monkey.
You got gorgeous eyes, really nice ears a winning personality.
It's just that you're too short for me.
So, Wendy, what do you think?
You gonna take that job at the zoo?
I don't know, but I do know I had a great time with you today.
Oh, me too.
Hope I didn't drive you nuts with all my animal voices.
No, it was fun.
I've always wondered what a Tasmanian devil sounded like.
Boy, I'm sorry I played all those stupid tricks on you back when we were kids.
The truth is, I really did like you.
Well, the truth is, when I was a little girl I had a secret crush on you.
Well, what if I told you I had a secret crush on you right now?
I'd say the secret's out.
- Hey, you're back.
And you're kissing.
- Hi, Danny.
Wow.
I don't know what to say.
When you guys left here you weren't even friends, and now boy, you're very friendly, aren't you?
Yeah, isn't it great?
And thanks to you for getting us together.
Oh, hey, don't mention it.
Joey, why don't you and I get dinner ready now?
Wendy, you must be tired.
If you want, you can rest in my room.
All right.
Yeah, I am a little jet-lagged.
Ginger, wanna take a nap up in Danny's room?
Whoa.
Wait a minute.
I haven't quite monkey-proofed the sheets yet.
Oh, don't worry, I'll take care of Ginger.
I am a monkey expert.
I've read every Curious George book.
- Great.
Thanks, Joey.
- Sure.
Ginger, are you gonna be a good girl?
I'll see you guys later.
And I'll see you a little later, you Tasmanian devil.
Why don't you cop a squat up here on the couch?
We'll get to know each other.
Hey, what do you say we get out this month's National Geographic see if any of your friends are in there?
I got an idea.
We could pick nits off each other.
Joey, we need to talk.
I'm trying to bond with the little chimp.
What you're trying to do is bond with my little sister.
What's wrong with that?
Your sister happens to be a great girl.
Joey, I wanted you two to be friends.
I didn't want you to make a move on her.
You know, if I didn't know you better I'd swear you didn't want me going out with your sister.
Look, it's just not a good idea, all right?
Danny, I really don't care what you think, okay?
- You don't care what I think?
- No, I don't.
I'm your best friend, Joey.
Well, you're not being my best friend now.
- I'm as involved as you are.
- You're not involved.
It's my sister and you.
- Where'd Ginger go?
- I don't know.
You're the monkey-sitter.
Why don't you just mind your own business, okay?
You have no right to tell me who I can date.
Now, if you'll just back off and get out of my way, I got a monkey to find.
- Joey.
- Don't "Joey" me, okay?
My avocado mask is hardening.
Yeah, I'm turning into guacamole.
Mm.
Let's scrape this off with Doritos.
Girls, have you seen Ginger?
Sorry, Joey, we can't see anything.
Just my luck.
I finally meet a woman I really like and I lose her monkey.
- Out of my way, Danny.
- We should wake Wendy.
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
Making me look irresponsible.
That would play into your hands.
I just thought maybe she knew a secret monkey call or something.
Okay, Kimmy, one more minute and I'll comb out your perm and shampoo in the special rinse.
I hope you like the color I mixed for you.
It's very subtle.
Thanks, Deej.
I wouldn't trust my hair to anyone but you.
D.J.: Kimmy, you can't afford anybody but me.
Good point.
D.J.: Time's up on our fruit facials.
Okay.
All right, Kimmy, it's time to make you beautiful.
Oh, Alex.
Isn't that precious?
You rocked your daddy to sleep.
Now can you burp him for me?
Mm.
Oh, I'm awake.
I'm awake.
I didn't miss anything.
When did we have a baby?
Come on, honey, you were up all night with the twins.
Oh, hello.
Why don't you take a nap?
Yeah, that's a good idea.
And why don't you join me?
We could turn the lights down lock the doors, and nap like we did on our honeymoon.
Mm.
- I could go for a good nap.
- Have mercy.
- I'll be right in.
- Can't wait.
Okay, you guys, now, I want you to go to sleep.
And if you wake up, just talk among yourselves, okay?
Hi, Becky.
Mm.
Is that a new perfume?
It's a walk on the wild side, isn't it?
Mm.
Can't keep your hands out of my hair, huh, honey?
Oh, I love you.
Oh.
Oh, that feels good, honey.
You know all the right spots.
Little bit of rough stuff tonight, huh, honey?
Has Uncle Jesse been a bad boy?
Becky when was the last time you shaved your back?
God.
I just made out with a monkey.
- Did you see that?
- Yes.
And, honey, I think I learned a few tricks from Ginger.
Get over here.
Whoa.
I knew I should've knocked.
There you are.
Okay, come on.
Come to your buddy Joey.
Oh, man, she hates me.
Why won't that monkey give me a break?
I don't know, but if you talk sexy to her, she'll nibble on your ear.
Would you forget about the monkey for a second?
- You and I have to talk.
- There's nothing to talk about.
You told me you didn't want me going out with your sister.
- Joey, would you listen to me?
No, I won't.
Are you ready to take that nap?
Yeah, right after I take a bath.
Ew!
Ugh!
D.J.: Well, I think I've done all I can do.
I can't wait to see it.
Trust me.
You can wait.
Boy, do I look that stunning?
I'm definitely stunned.
Doesn't she look cute, girls?
You look like Bozo.
She means Francesca Bozo, that Italian supermodel.
I'm talking about Bozo with the ball on his nose.
D.J., what did you do to me?
It's not D.J.'s fault, it's Nikata's.
He's cursed this whole house.
We gotta go feed him.
- I've gotta see my hair.
- Kimmy, don't.
Oh, my God.
I am so sorry.
I'll pay to have it shaved.
No, no, no, I love it.
And finally, I'm one step ahead of Madonna.
And the best part is, my mom's gonna freak out.
Thanks, Deej.
Happy to help.
How do we feed him?
You got me.
He has no stomach.
He's just a head on a stick.
Here comes Ginger.
There goes Ginger.
- Ginger, come back here.
- Joey, come back here.
Hi, Dad.
Steph, what are you doing?
I'm trying to stop the horrible curse on this household.
Oh.
Well, keep trying.
Boy, tough house to take a nap in.
Hey, my Nikata bank.
What do you mean, "bank"?
I bought it for my tacky souvenir collection.
Watch.
MALE  Feed me.
Thank you.
Have a nice day.
You mean there's no curse?
No, it's just for fun.
See, Michelle, you little kids will believe anything.
Oh, please.
Ah.
There you are, you little missing link.
Okay, now, come to Joey.
Ginger, no.
Hey, Ginger.
Hey, Ginger.
Yeah, come on in.
Please?
Ginger, look, there's nothing to be afraid of.
Just don't look down.
Ginger.
Ginger.
Joey, what are you doing out there?
I'm baking bread.
What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm trying to get a chimp.
Joey, it's dangerous out here.
Would you get in the house right now?
- I'm tired of you treating me like a kid.
- I don't treat you like you're a kid.
I know what's best for you.
Get in here before you catch cold.
- See?
You're doing it again.
- Okay, excuse me.
Now you got nowhere to run to.
Joey, would you listen to me?
No, you listen to me.
I'm a nice guy, Wendy's a big girl.
She doesn't need you to protect her from me.
I am not trying to protect her from you.
Oh, no?
Well, then, what are you doing?
I'm trying to protect you from her.
Protect me from her?
What are you talking about?
Joey, I don't wanna.
I don't want you to get hurt.
Wendy is the kind of person, she's totally committed to her work.
She could pick up tomorrow and just wind up halfway around the world.
I've seen her break a lot of hearts, okay?
Well, I appreciate you looking out for me but I really like Wendy, and I'm willing to take that risk.
So would you just do me a favor and stop trying to be my dad?
I'm sorry.
I gotta learn to let go.
But you are turning into a fine young man.
Well, thanks.
So would you just be my friend?
I'll be more than that.
I'll be your best friend.
- Hey, Ginger.
- Ginger.
- Open the window.
- Would you open the window, please?
- Go get Wendy.
- Thank you.
- Ginger.
- Fine.
Get Wendy.
I'll bet you thought you were pretty funny with that little window gag, huh, Ginger?
Hey, thanks for saving us, Wendy.
I thought you were taking a nap.
I couldn't stop thinking about that job at the zoo.
If I take it, it's gonna mean living in a big city with noise and traffic and pollution.
So you're not gonna take it?
Well, it also means hot showers and pizzas and my little Tasmanian devil.
So I'm taking it.
All right.
You know what?
You two actually make a pretty nice couple.
It's great you're gonna be in town.
Well, we just have one little problem.
Your monkey's been hiding from me all day.
I think she hates me.
Then why is she hugging me?
Because her favorite game is hide and go seek.
Well, great.
Mine too.
Hey, put her there, babe.
Everything okay?
I looked out the window and I saw three monkeys in a tree.
Oh.
Good gosh.
All right, okay, I give up.
Let me go get dressed, I'll dry my hair and we'll catch a flick.
What's that?
Okay, fine.
We'll go see the Planet of the Apes.
And there goes another nice couple.
Come on.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Guess what time it is?
- Four-thirty?
- Nope.
It's time for The Michelle Show.
Michelle It's not that I don't love seeing The Michelle Show over and over but I have to do The Homework Show.
My first guest is Yogi Bear.
I'm smarter than the average bear.
Terrific show.
One of your best.
And now, here's D.J. Michelle, I don't do impressions.
I said, now, here's D.J. Hello, I'm George Washington.
I was your very first president.
How's it going?
Wow, you sound just like him.
Amazing, isn't it?
And that's our show.
Michelle   Here's Uncle Jesse.
We've been looking for you everywhere.
Why?
Because that's how you find somebody, silly.
You're my little munchkin but I got a lot of work to do so go hit the yellow brick road.
Hey.
Where did that drum come from?
It's inside this machine.
Get out of here.
You get out of here.
I got a whole band right here.
Watch.
I'll show you guys how I construct a song.
First, we start with the drums, like this: Add bass.
Guitar.
Little horns.
And Elvis.
ELVIS  Thank you very much.
We gotta play with that.
Freeze.
Stick your hands where I can see them.
Stick your hands down.
Okay, let me tell you guys something, this is not a toy store.
This is very expensive equipment that I'm still making payments on.
Under no circumstances are you to touch anything in this whole entire studio.
My feet are touching the floor.
She's got you there.
You guys run along and I'm gonna get back to my work.
But it's Saturday.
You should be playing.
Get some fresh air.
I'd love to put on my play clothes and hit the sandbox with you bozos but the good Uncle Jesse keeps saying, "Be responsible, finish your work then go out and enjoy some well-earned relaxation".
The good Uncle Jesse is a nerd.
I'm hip, but he's doing his job.
Otherwise, I'd be listening to the bad Uncle Jesse who says: "Oh, work is for chumps.
Go out and party.
You're having a good hair day, go share it with the world".
The bad Uncle Jesse sounds cool.
It's one thing to be cool, it's another thing to know right from wrong.
Now, I'm gonna sit here and I'm gonna finish my work.
Starting tomorrow.
Who wants ice cream?
Me, me, me.
Timmy Fanelli is twice as cute as Jimmy Fanelli.
No.
Jimmy Fanelli is 10 times cuter than Timmy Fanelli.
- No way.
- What are you guys arguing about?
They're identical twins.
Jimmy's two minutes older.
He's much more mature.
That is the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
Let me get this straight, you are calling me dumb?
Gibbler, you're so dumb you don't know how dumb you are.
I know how dumb I am.
You're the one who's dumb.
Capital D-U-M.
Dumb.
Kimmy, there's a B. Where?
I hate those things.
I think we have a winner.
Deej, how can you be friends with this?
Hey, she picked me.
She got stuck with you.
Please, you guys have been arguing the whole way home.
Not all the way.
Only since Lake Street.
- It wasn't Lake Street, it was Chestnut.
- No, it wasn't.
I can't believe this.
You guys are arguing about where you started arguing.
Now, you're gonna shake hands and be friends.
All right, kid, put her there.
Gotcha, shrimp boat.
Stuff it, bird legs.
That's it.
Look, you're my sister and you're my best friend.
Now, we are not leaving until you guys start acting nice to each other.
Fine.
- What are you doing?
- I'm ordering pizza.
This could take months.
- Years.
- Centuries.
- Infinity.
- Double infinity.
- Triple infinity.
- Quadruple.
There she is.
Wendy and I are going bike riding.
Ever since my sister moved back to San Francisco you've been singing show tunes.
That is just not true.
I hope you know what you're getting yourself into.
I mean, my sister is a pretty serious athlete.
You're not exactly in tiptop physical condition, you know?
Wendy happens to like me for who I am.
I don't have to do anything special to try and impress her.
- Hey.
How you doing?
- Hi, Danny.
One-eighty, 181, 182.
- Hi, Wendy.
- Hi, Joey.
Just doing my little morning pump up.
Today I'm working on abs, pecs and lobes.
Lobes?
You're working out your ears?
Yep.
Feel the definition in these babies.
I love a man with ears of steel.
And his brain is one big ball of aluminum foil.
All right, let's throw those bikes on your rack and head on out.
I don't have a bike rack.
I don't even have a car.
Well, the trail's 20 miles away.
How the heck are we gonna get there?
Ride our bikes.
Oh, sure.
Yeah.
The 20-mile ride there will be a nice warm-up.
And the 20-mile ride back will be a nice little cool down.
Especially for a guy who can do You're absolutely right.
I am in tiptop riding condition.
Yes, sirree.
I just hope the old bike can take it.
That's your bike?
Oh, yeah, a lot of the top riders are going back to the banana seat.
Hello?
Anybody here?
This looks like big fun.
Ah, ah, ah.
Michelle Elizabeth Tanner, I am shocked.
So am I. Who are you?
I'm the good Michelle.
I tell you the right thing to do.
Don't listen to that wimp.
Uh-oh.
You must be the bad Michelle.
Duh.
Don't listen to her.
Stick a sock in it, goody pants.
You got a bad attitude.
Thanks.
Now go on, break the stupid rules.
But I'll get in trouble.
Not if you don't get caught.
Good girls always follow the rules.
What do I do?
What do I do?
What are you, a chicken?
Be good.
Be good.
Be good.
- Party.
Party.
Party.
- Be good.
Be good.
- Party.
Party.
Party.
- Be good.
Be good.
Be good.
Enough.
It's party time.
All right.
You're bad to the bone.
Where did I go wrong?
Michelle, what are you doing?
Come here.
- Didn't I tell you not to touch my stuff?
Jess.
Don't tell Daddy.
You'll get me in trouble.
Hey, is everything okay down here?
Everything is super.
No, everything is not super.
She was down here playing with my stuff after I specifically told her not to.
Really?
Did you do that, Michelle?
I was just having fun.
Well, your fun is over now.
For the rest of the day, you're gonna be in your room, and no TV.
Can I rent a videotape?
No tapes, no cable, no pay-per-view.
You gotta be kidding.
No, I'm not.
You break the rules, you're gonna be punished.
Thanks a lot, Uncle Tattletale.
I am not a tattletale.
Danny, she just called me a-- So I'm a tattletale, but it's not my fault.
You were messing around with my stuff.
I thought I was your little munchkin, but I was wrong.
Okay, Michelle, that's enough.
Now, come with me up to your room.
I hope you're happy.
I still got you, Comet.
Comet, time for your walk.
I'm totally bummed.
I hope you learned your lesson.
Hey, princess, go kiss a frog.
You got me in trouble.
That wasn't me.
That was Uncle Tattletale.
He is a blabbermouth.
Wanna make him very sorry?
You should mind your own business.
Now, now, be polite.
How do I make him sorry?
You run away from home.
Uncle Jesse will never squeal on you again.
Sounds good to me.
I'm out of here.
GOOD  Michelle, be a good girl.
BAD  Don't listen to her.
Pack that suitcase.
Don't do this.
This is a big, big mistake.
Get a life.
Get the door, Teddy.
- Who is it?
Michelle Tanner.
- Hi, Michelle.
- Hi, Teddy.
Can I live with you?
Sure.
Come on in.
Guess what?
Michelle's gonna live with us.
Does your dad know you're here?
No.
When you run away, you don't tell.
Why did you run away, sweetheart?
To teach Uncle Tattletale a lesson.
She's really cute.
Can we keep her?
I'm a fun girl.
Until we get this straightened out, you're welcome to stay here.
Thanks, New Dad.
All right, this is a big moment, Beck.
It's our son's first attempt at solid food.
And here's a shot of the proud father watching.
Honey, why don't we get some video of the baby?
Okay, we should get the kid too.
Here we go.
Okay, we're going to start with the strained bananas.
- And action.
All right.
She's grabbing the spoon, the spoon's in the strained bananas the strained bananas are going into the mouth and here's another shot of the proud father watching.
- Jess.
- Sorry.
Back to the baby.
Open wide.
Here we go.
Strained bananas in.
And, whoa, strained bananas out.
Here's the father encouraging his son.
Come on, son, you can do it.
Do it for Dad.
Do it for Dad.
Sorry.
Back to the baby.
Okay, take two.
And strained bananas in.
- And it's a keeper.
- All right.
Way to go, Nick.
Have you seen Michelle?
She's not in her room.
- What do you mean?
She's grounded.
- I checked the house.
- Don't know where she is.
- She's gotta be around.
- I'll check front.
- I'll check back.
Michelle.
Michelle.
Phone.
- Hello?
Oh, thank God.
Yeah.
Okay.
We'll be right over.
Thanks, Henry.
Well?
Michelle went down the street to Teddy's house.
She ran away from home.
- What?
- What?
Why would she do that?
Well, she was mad at me.
She called me Uncle Tattletale.
- I'll see to it she never runs away again.
- Well, what are you gonna do?
I'm gonna hug her, then I'm gonna kiss her then I'm gonna ground her for life.
Whoa, whoa, hold it, tall man.
- I've got a better idea.
- What?
Just do what my dad did to me when I ran away.
I guarantee she'll never do it again.
You sit here.
You sit here.
- Why do we have to do this?
- Yeah, it's never gonna work.
Sure it is, I saw it on TV.
"Little sisters and best friends who hate each other.
On the next Geraldo".
Give me a break.
Look, the idea is, you guys can learn to be friends if you find things that you have in common.
Now, each time you agree, you move your chairs closer.
When you disagree, you move them apart, understand?
- We're not idiots.
- Speak for yourself.
Okay, what's your favorite book?
- Charlotte's Web.
- How To Pick Up Boys.
There you go.
You both read a book.
Actually, I never read it.
It's a book on tape.
Moving right along.
- What's your favorite food?
- Pizza.
There you go, Kimmy.
You love pizza.
Not as much as I love trout.
Deej, this is so stupid.
It sure is.
There you go.
You guys both agree it's stupid.
Move your chairs closer.
Now, come on, let's keep going.
I don't wanna keep going.
You're always telling me what to do.
Yeah, she's so bossy.
I'm sick of it.
We agree again.
And D.J.'s always late.
Oh, I know, the hair-spray queen.
- She has to look perfect at all times.
- I know what you mean.
Do you know she's never complimented my hair?
Me neither.
I think you've got the idea.
I've tried to tell her to chill out.
But when she's on one of her power trips, forget it.
And did you ever watch TV with her?
I know.
She never lets go of the remote.
Now that we're all friends, why don't we just change the subject?
Oh, and sharing a bathroom with her.
Hey, you might as well just go down to the Texaco station.
I could go on for hours.
- Do you like frozen yogurt?
- Love it.
- Strawberry?
- My favorite.
- Yeah, let's go.
Yeah.
- Girls, wait.
I like frozen yogurt too.
Pick a card.
Any card.
Oh, man.
I got the Old Maid again.
Don't play this for money.
Teddy, where am I gonna sleep tonight?
We're out of beds.
You can sleep in the kitchen with Sparky.
I used to have a dog.
Those were the days.
Michelle, I think that's your family.
I bet they're coming to say they're sorry.
- Hi, Danny.
Hi, Jesse.
- Hi.
- Where's my little girl?
- She's in the living room.
All right, Danny.
Be strong, remember the plan.
Hello, boys.
Do you have something to say to me?
Yes, Michelle, we feel very bad that you left home.
I knew it.
Keep going.
Well, we miss you very much, munchkin.
And you'll never be Uncle Tattletale again?
I don't know.
You don't live with us anymore.
- I don't?
- No, remember?
You don't like our rules, you wanna live here.
That's cool.
I brought extra clothes, your toothbrush, everything you need in this suitcase.
What is this, a joke?
It's not a joke, Michelle.
There's nothing funny about running away from home.
- Bye-bye.
- See you, kid.
If you need us, you know the number.
Give us a buzz.
Bye, sweetheart.
Wait.
You forgot something.
What?
What did we forget?
Me.
Really?
You mean you wanna come back and live with us?
Even with Uncle Tattletale?
Yes, I wanna go home.
- And we want you to come home.
- Yeah, we missed you.
Michelle, don't you ever do this again.
- You had us worried sick.
- It wasn't very smart, young lady.
You're telling me.
I was gonna sleep with the dog.
You're not gonna sleep with anybody but your own bed.
My room.
My bed.
My pig.
I love this place.
All right, come on, Michelle.
It's time for one of our little talks.
Now, what you did today was very wrong.
I know.
I should never touch your stuff.
That's right.
But I'm talking about running away.
That was very dangerous.
You're never to leave this house without our permission.
If you have a problem, talk to me or someone else in this house, capiche?
Caphiche.
All right, now level with me.
Why'd you really run away?
I was mad at you because you got me in trouble.
I felt terrible about getting you in trouble.
But I couldn't let you break the rules.
Because if you did it today, you'd do it all the time.
- And that's not cool.
- Am I still your little munchkin?
You can still be my little munchkin if you stop calling me Uncle Tattletale.
Okay, Uncle Jesse.
All right.
You're never gonna run away again?
- Never ever, ever, ever.
- All right, let's shake on it.
Ready?
I love you, munchkin.
I know.
I love you, Uncle Jesse.
I know.
I'll see you after dinner, kid.
Uncle Jesse, were you really gonna leave me at Teddy's?
What do you think?
That was very sneaky.
I've got another good idea.
I don't wanna hear it.
Let's sneak out and watch Yo!
MTV Raps.
I want you out of here.
I like the way she dresses.
- Michelle, I'm so proud of you.
- Thank you.
And remember, always do the right thing.
Oh, I will.
She can get on my nerves.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Okey-dokey.
Now, where did I put that other shoe?
Hi, Mr. Woodchuck.
I wish you were real.
I am real.
Who said that?
I did.
You can't talk without Joey.
Did you ever think he can't talk without me?
Hello, Joe.
Pay no attention to that man under the bed.
Joey, you're busted.
Okay, so it wasn't Mr. Woodchuck talking it was actually me.
Duh.
Duh.
All right.
Now, remember, cow kids, the very important code of the West: Always keep your saddles dry, now, you hear?
Hey, I've got an idea.
Let's get all dressed up and I'll take an official family portrait.
Oh, no, no, no.
I hated that when I was a kid.
I not gonna put Nicky and Alex through that kind of torture.
Oh, come on, honey.
I saw your family portrait.
You and your father looked adorable in those dad-and-lad leisure suits.
We looked like father-and-son hot-tub salesmen.
Come on, Jess.
Oh, all right, but I want my kids to look cool.
Oh, of course they'll look cool.
Now, where are those lavender sailor suits?
- Hey, Jess.
- Hey, how did it go?
- Did D.J. get her learner's permit?
- It was a nightmare.
- She flunked?
- Worse.
- I passed.
All right, Deej.
I failed.
I don't get it.
I copied every one of D.J.'s answers and I still flunked the test.
Kimmy, they give everyone different tests, so no one can cheat.
- They do?
- Uh-huh.
That's what's wrong with the world today.
No one trusts anyone.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Okay, Dad, let me have the keys.
Deej, you just have your learner's permit.
You can't drive a car unless there's a licensed adult in the front with you.
Fine, you can have shotgun.
Let's roll.
Look, I'm just not sure you're ready yet, you know?
Dad, I took Driver's Ed.
I passed the written test and I'm 15.
The state of California says I'm ready to drive.
Yeah, but the state of California doesn't have to sit in the front seat with you.
Dad, come on.
Yeah, Dad, come on.
I'm sure when you were 15 you were just dying to get behind the wheel of your mom's Pacer.
Not me.
I was perfectly happy taking the bus.
And my dates were very impressed with the extra legroom.
Dad, this is really cruel.
Please don't make me beg.
- All right.
- Thanks, you're the greatest.
Let's go.
Okay, just let me shower, shave and, you know, paint the house.
- Dad.
- Danny.
Okay, okay.
Boy, everybody's so uptight around here.
I wrote a song about a duck and a pig.
Michelle, will you please leave us alone?
Rita and I are busy telling fortunes, okay?
Tell mine, tell mine.
Okay.
In the very near future you'll be singing a song about a duck and a pig out in the hall.
That was easy.
Too easy.
She'll be back.
I'm back.
Michelle.
I didn't finish my song.
Where was I?
Oh, yeah.
That's enough.
If you don't get out right now I'm gonna call the hairy, scary monster.
Oh, please.
All I have to do is say his name three times.
Oh, hairy, scary monster.
That's one.
Is he nice, like the Cookie Monster?
Are you kidding?
He scares the Cookie Monster.
Because he's the hairy, scary monster.
That's two.
Uh-oh.
Next comes three.
It sure does.
- Hairy, scary-- - Don't say it!
Joey, help.
Joey, help!
Michelle, what is it?
He's coming.
Michelle, would you take it easy?
Who's coming?
Stephanie said there was a hairy, scary monster.
Oh, no, I said it.
Michelle, there's no such thing as a hairy, scary monster.
That's two.
One more time and he comes.
Okay, you've gotta trust me on this one.
I'm gonna say it one more time and you'll see, nothing's gonna happen.
Wait.
Okay, go ahead.
Okay.
Hairy, scary monster.
It's okay, you can look now.
See, there's no monster.
What a rip-off.
Now, Michelle, when Stephanie was telling you about this hairy, scary monster, were you bugging her?
It's possible.
Well, I think Stephanie just played a little joke on you just to get rid of you.
So don't you think you should forgive and forget?
What are you, nuts?
I'm getting them back.
What was I thinking?
Look how smoothly I'm driving.
Do you notice?
D.J.: Yeah.
Notice my braking?
I even filled the car with gas for you.
There's nobody better to teach you than your old dad.
All right.
Okay, Dad.
Hand over the keys.
Uh, uh, uh.
First, let's go over a few small details.
- Dad, the keys.
- Uh, uh, uh.
Now, this is an automobile, Deej.
Hood, headlights, bumper, bugs.
Keys.
Okay.
- Dad.
- Sorry.
Yes.
- Okay, be careful opening the door.
- Okay.
- Okay, seat belts on.
- Very good.
Can I be any more responsible?
Okay, and the car on.
Whoa, whoa, aren't you forgetting something?
Oh, yeah.
Radio on.
Oh, Dad.
Deej.
Dad, I have to learn to drive with music like a normal person.
I don't want you driving like a normal person, I want you driving like me.
Just follow my instructions completely now, okay?
First, adjust the mirrors.
Very good.
Now, Deej, listen to me.
Get your radar out, okay?
Examine the big picture.
Check for traffic, pedestrians, stray cattle.
Dad, we're in an empty parking lot.
Are you gonna question every instruction I give you?
Sorry.
No cattle.
Very good.
Now, secure the litterbag.
This is unbelievable.
Litterbag secure, sir.
Anything else?
No, I guess that about covers it.
Why don't we just pack it in for today and let it all sink in?
What?
I didn't even get to drive.
Okay, I guess we can move on to lesson number two.
Okay.
Now, with your hands holding the wheel firmly at 10 and two.
That's 11 and one.
Ten and two.
Okay, put your foot on the brake and carefully put the car into drive.
Okay, now slowly and gently, take your foot off of the brake and put it onto the accelerator, pressing ever so lightly.
Ever so lightly!
Put it in park.
Put it in park.
Dad, you're making me so tense.
Tense is good.
It'll keep you alert.
Okay, okay, okay, I'm sorry.
Let's start over again, okay?
Hands at 10 and two.
Foot on the brake.
Put the car into drive this time keep your foot off of the gas pedal.
Let's just master the fine art of riding the brake, okay?
Oh, this is nice.
There's no need to be a speed demon.
D.J.: Dad, I think a snail just passed us.
Wait, stop!
Stop!
Now what?
You're heading straight for that tree.
Don't you see it?
You can't mean that tree on the other end of the lot?
Dad, I'm nowhere near it.
I didn't say you were near it.
I asked you if you saw it.
You'll never learn to drive if you don't listen to me.
Well, I'm never gonna learn, because you don't want me to learn.
Okay, that's it.
You are way too emotional to be in the driver's seat.
- Switch places.
Out of the car.
- Fine.
- Fine.
- Fine.
- Fine.
Fine.
D.J.: Fine.
- Fine.
D.J.: Fine.
- Fine.
D.J.: Fine.
What are you doing back there?
Well, I'm really not in the mood to sit next to you.
You don't trust me.
You don't want me to drive.
You don't wanna help me, so please just leave me alone.
This went well.
Okay, Jess, all ready.
Bring in the boys.
Cheese.
What have you done to my babies?
I took them down to the Harley Shop.
They opened a new department: Tykes on Bikes.
What's that on your heads?
Do-rags.
Nice touch, huh?
- Do-rags?
- Uh-huh.
Oh, my mother's gonna love this picture.
Honey, I don't want everyone knowing my kids are baldies.
Sweetheart, lots of babies are bald.
Not me.
When I was born, the doctor smacked my butt and gave me a blow dryer.
That figures.
Well, I have to admit, you guys do look awfully cute.
Okay, smile.
Come here, pumpkin pie.
All right, Nicky, give me that Elvis lip.
Sorry, Mom.
- How'd the driving lesson go?
- Ask him.
She's got a serious attitude problem.
Me?
He was screaming at me like a maniac.
Excuse me, but that's a natural reaction when somebody's hot-rodding.
I better go take care of this.
Okay, fellas, now that he's gone, what do you say we play a game?
Hide the do-rags.
Let me tell you something, police officers have pulled me over just to compliment my driving.
I bet they were on foot.
Danny, lighten up, now.
You know, teaching someone to drive, it should be a fun thing.
- You really think so?
- Absolutely.
Oh, thanks, Uncle Jesse.
This is gonna be so fun.
Me?
You want me to teach you to drive?
Yeah.
Who better?
You know everything about cars.
You're the Road Warrior.
I guess I am, huh?
Well, that's fine with me if it's okay with your dad.
Is it okay, Dad?
I don't know, Deej.
You really wanna learn to drive from a guy who's dressed like a pirate?
It's a do-rag and it's gone, okay?
You can trust me.
I'm a father now.
But if you wanna take her out again yourself-- No, no, I trust you.
I trust you.
Thanks, Dad.
Just be very, very careful, okay?
All right, now, Deej, what have you learned so far?
Uh, how to secure the litterbag and check for cattle.
Good.
Well, if a cow has to throw away a gum wrapper, you'll be ready.
Hello, yeah, Governor Wilson's office?
Yes, hi, Danny Tanner here, concerned citizen.
Yeah, I was just wondering is there any way we can raise the driving age to 35?
Check it out, "Doogie Howser reveals his most intimate secrets".
"Doogie likes tuna fish and music".
Boy, he really spilled his guts.
- Guess what?
I'm a cheerleader.
- Not now, Michelle.
Give me a A. Give me a B. Give me a C. Give me a D. Give me an O-U-T.
Out, Out.
Way out.
This is my room too.
Okay.
I guess I'm gonna have to call the hairy, scary monster.
Oops, I said his name once.
I'm not scared.
Oh, really?
Hairy, scary monster.
That's two.
I'm still not scared.
You will be.
Hairy, scary.
Run, Michelle, run.
I don't think so.
Okay, you asked for it.
Monster.
Well, well, well, look who's not here.
Okay, there is no monster.
But get out anyway.
Thank you, Joey.
You're very welcome, Michelle.
Joey, we knew it was you all along.
Right, Rita?
- Heck, no.
Okay.
Now, look, you guys are all even now, okay?
So let's call a little truce.
Steph, no more scaring Michelle.
When Stephanie's here with her friends, you gotta give her some space.
Deal?
Deal.
- Deal.
Okay, here, put this on, Michelle and let's all howl on it.
Ready.
Wow, I never thought I'd be driving your Mustang.
I like to call her Sally.
Mustang Sally.
You know, there's only 1100 of these in the whole country but mine is the only one with a complete set of Elvis lug nuts.
All right.
Go ahead, start it up.
You mean I don't even have to wrestle you for the keys?
D.J., driving should be a very calm, cool, soothing experience.
Now, turn the key and let's cruise.
Listen to that baby purr.
She's talking to you, Deej.
You hear her?
Yeah.
She's saying I should've learned to drive with you in the first place.
Uncle Jesse, you're the coolest.
I know, it's just something I've learned to live with.
All right, now, before you put it into drive I want you to feel the vibrations.
Okay, listen to Sally.
That way, you become the car and in turn the car becomes you.
Yeah.
I am the car.
Righteous.
All right, now go to the lamppost and make a right.
You mean I get to leave the parking lot?
This is so cool.
Okay, is there anything I should know before making my very first turn?
Sally will tell you.
Now, just simply feel it.
Feel it.
Feel it.
Feel it.
Feel it!
My baby, my-- It's just a car.
It's just a car.
It's just a c. I am so sorry.
I feel terrible.
I promise I'll do better tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
Why am I watching this?
You made it back.
How'd it go?
Oh, everything was fine.
Oh, thank God.
Except for the accident.
- You got in an accident?
- Well, nobody got hurt.
I just put a teeny tiny scratch on Mustang Sally.
Everything's okay, right, Uncle Jesse?
Sure, it's just a car.
I should've never let you go out.
Why can't you be cool about this like Uncle Jesse?
He's taking me out again tomorrow.
Actually, Deej, I was thinking, what's the rush?
I mean, you know.
San Francisco has such an excellent, excellent public-transportation system.
You know, like I always say, there's no place like a bus to make new friends.
I can't believe you're saying this.
You sound just like Dad.
I passed the test.
I got my learner's permit.
It was amazing.
I took home the manual.
I read the stuff inside.
And then when I took the test I remembered the stuff that I read.
You mean you studied.
Is that what I did?
Wow.
Oh, that's my dad.
He's taking me out for a driving lesson right now.
Oh, what a joker, he's wearing a blindfold.
For the first time in my life, I wish I was a Gibbler.
All I wanna do is be able to drive a car like everybody else in America.
Why are you guys making this so hard for me?
Sweetheart, I know I've been crazy about all this but for the last 15 years, I've been trying to protect you.
When you learned to walk, I covered the whole house in foam rubber.
I can't foam-rubber all of San Francisco.
I know.
I got estimates.
Deej, if anything ever happened to you I don't know what I'd do.
Dad, don't worry.
Nothing is gonna happen to me.
How do you know that?
There's a lot of bad drivers out there.
Kimmy Gibbler is out on the road right now.
Deej, I know how you feel but I'm a father now too, and so I know how your dad feels.
I mean, since the day my kids were born, I haven't stopped worrying about them.
It's really nice that you guys are worried about me.
But what am I supposed to do, ride a bike the rest of my life?
Of course not.
How about a horse?
Dad, you have to let go.
I know, I have a hard time letting go but now I have to let go of you at 55 miles an hour.
But, Dad, the more I practice, the better driver I'm gonna be.
Danny, she's right.
Somebody's gotta teach her.
It's either us or Mr. Gibbler.
I vote for us.
Thanks, Dad.
- Thanks, Uncle Jesse.
All right.
And this time, I'll try not to be so tense.
Right, and I'll try not to be so laid-back.
Thanks.
Let's get out there.
Whose car are we gonna take?
- His.
- His.
All right, fine.
We'll take mine.
I mean, considering I trust her more than you do.
What are you talking about?
I trust her just as much as you do.
- Okay, fine.
We'll take yours.
- All right.
Okay, you guys ready?
Oh, yeah, yeah, we're cool and calm and belted in really tight.
Now, whatever you do, don't use the feel-it method.
Just pull out and take it nice and easy.
Yeah, but not too easy.
You have to drive defensively.
Yeah, but you don't wanna be uptight.
Are you calling me uptight?
- Uptight, paranoid, whatever.
- Oh, now I'm paranoid?
- I care-- - I realize that, but-- Hey, if you boys don't behave I'll turn this car right around and go straight home.
- Sorry.
- Sorry.
Okay, signal.
Check my mirrors.
Look over my shoulder and pull out into traffic for the very first time.
- I'm really driving.
I love it.
She's pretty good, huh, Danny?
- Yeah, I'm feeling good about this.
- Can I turn on the radio?
- No.
No.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
D.J.: Dad.
Dad.
Oh, look at this, here come my girls and I bet they can't wait to hug their dad.
Will you tell D.J. to stop hogging the bathroom?
It just so happens I was in there first.
Well, pin a rose on your nose.
Girls, I'm still in the hug mode.
She turned off my Beauty and the Beast tape.
After the hundredth time you played it.
I'm trying to learn the words.
I guess I can put my arms down now, huh?
Uh, tough day.
I gotta start screening those junior rangers.
I had a cryer, two wetters, and some kid got a splinter in his butt.
Was the splinter made of wood?
Excuse me, but we were talking about D.J. hogging the bathroom.
D.J.: I was not hogging the bathroom.
- That's why you stay in there-- Okay, hold it.
Hold it, hold it.
If I didn't know any better, I'd say this wasn't the happiest family.
Oh, please.
You know what?
I've got a great idea.
Reserved seating in the bathroom?
No, let's take time out from all this bickering and go out together as a family.
I hereby declare tonight Tanner Family Fun Night.
- Oh, man.
Come on, go with me on this.
Two hours of nonstop feel-good Tanner family fun.
- What do you say?
- I guess.
Oh, that's the spirit.
Go get your coats, come on.
Honey, I don't wanna argue with you but are you saying that my mother is wrong?
No, sweetheart.
I'm saying your mother's insane.
Oh, darling, you must be joking.
My mother simply suggested that we use cornstarch when we diaper the boys.
But we wanna keep the boys dry, not grow crops in their underpants.
You know what you need?
A little dose of Tanner family fun.
Grab the twins and come to dinner with us.
- You know what?
That sounds real good.
- But we'll pass.
We will?
We don't want the boys going out during cold and flu season.
Come on.
Don't you think you're babying them?
Well, sweetheart, they are babies.
Sure you don't wanna come?
We're gonna sing show tunes on the way.
When you put it that way, why take a chance during cold and flu season?
- We'll have to pass.
- Okay, miss the funnest night of the year.
Okay, everybody, let's go.
It's Tanner family fun time.
Come on, everybody.
Hut, hut, hut.
Okay, where do you guys wanna eat?
- I want pizza.
- I want burgers.
- I want tacos.
- I need chocolate cake.
No problem, I'll find a Mexican-Italian burger and cake emporium.
Oh, yeah, could I have picked a better restaurant than this, huh?
These pirates look real.
Ahoy, ye scurvy seadogs!
Welcome to ye Pirate Cove.
This way.
Shiver me timbers.
Dad, this place is so lame.
What if my friends see me here?
That would make them just as lame as you, wouldn't it?
Yo ho, yo ho.
Got you there, matey.
Just slap your barnacles right here.
Okay, we've got three shipmates.
- Thank you.
- And two little buccaneers.
A kiddie menu for moi?
How rude.
Look, it got puzzles.
Connect the dots.
Very challenging.
Don't worry, I'll help you.
I'm not into fish.
You got any pizza?
Aargh.
Maybe you didn't notice the boat, pal but we got kind of a seafood thing going on here.
But I'll go up to the galley and see if I can't drum you up a sliver of dried salted beef.
- Yum.
- Har-har-har.
What a goofball.
Now, why don't we all get in the pirate spirit?
You know what?
What better way to get into the pirate spirit than donning our cardboard pirate hats?
Dad, you look like a dweeb.
Yes, but I'm a dweeb having fun.
You know why?
Because everything is more fun with a hat on.
Come on, put your hats on.
Let's go.
Are you swabbies ready to order?
Dad, please don't make me order from the kiddie menu.
You know what, honey?
You're right.
This is Tanner Family Fun Night and sweetheart, you can have anything you'd like.
I believe I'll have the sunken treasure.
"A scrumptious assortment of King Neptune's favorites from the bottom of the sea".
That sounds like a fun meal.
Whoa, $23.95.
Boy, fun doesn't come cheap around here, does it?
Aargh.
I believe I'll have the chocolate cake.
Oh, a delicious slab of cake near as big as your head, me hearty.
Whoa, baby.
Too bad we're out.
No chocolate cake?
What a rip-off.
Excuse me.
Everybody get down.
Get down, get down.
- D.J., what's wrong?
- There's some kids here from my school.
- Oh, yeah, there's Shelly Phillips.
- Dad, please.
Don't do anything to attract attention.
Happy birthday to you Chocolate cake.
Happy birthday to you Happy birthday, dear Sarah Her name's not Sarah.
Oh, sorry, wrong table.
Come back with the chocolate cake.
You have a big mouth.
Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Hey, Beck, we're back.
Got your favorite pizza.
Pineapple and anchovy.
I believe you forgot something.
Oh, yeah, extra cheese.
I've been thinking about this extra cheese thing.
It's a rip-off.
How do you know if you get extra cheese or not?
- You don't.
- I was talking about the baby's hat.
The one I asked you to put on if you took the baby into the cold air.
Yeah, I know the hat, I put it on.
It must've fallen off on my way out.
Really?
And landed behind this pillow?
What are the odds of that?
Million-to-one, say?
- Probably.
- Yeah.
Ah, Jess, look at this.
His head is freezing.
My mother says that 60 percent of the body's heat is lost through the head.
Sixty percent of his body is his head.
That's why he should be wearing a hat.
He's gonna get sick.
Beck, he can't wear the hat in the house.
It'll stunt his hair growth.
- What hair?
- The hair I'm trying to grow if we can get some sunlight and fresh air on his bald little head.
You know what, if you don't believe me, maybe you'll believe my mother.
She always said, "A hat on the head keeps a child out of bed".
Well, I'll call my mom on the other line.
She's got a few sayings of her own.
My favorite is, "My boy is always right".
Oh, hi, Mom.
Yeah.
Mom, listen, could you talk to Jesse?
He has a very cavalier attitude with the babies.
Hi, Mom.
Becky is really overprotective with these kids.
- Mm-hm.
- Mm-hm.
- She wants to talk to you.
- She wants to talk to you.
- I don't wanna talk to her-- - Be nice to my mom.
- Right now, yes.
- No, you-- - Hi, Nedra.
- Hi, Irene.
- How are you?
- Yeah, fine, fine.
- Right.
Yeah, well-- - Listen.
- My mom always said that-- - My mom always said that-- Let me just ask you this.
Did you really say, "A hat on the head keeps a child out of bed"?
Really?
You stitched it on a sampler?
Right, I got it.
"A scarf on the throat goes great with a coat".
Right.
Oh, yes, I'm writing these down.
Yeah, oh, yeah, got them.
Okay, hold on.
Your mom wants to talk to my mom.
Good because your mom wants to talk to my mom.
I can't put my mother through this.
Ma, doesn't Becky's mom squawk like a chick--?
Hi, Becky's mom.
No.
Oh, no.
I didn't say squawk like a chicken.
No, no, no.
I said talks like Charles Dickens.
Okay, yeah.
God bless us, every one.
Oh, nice move, Jess.
- Uh-oh, that's Alex.
- Hold it, Becky.
You can't go charging in the room every time the kid makes the slightest peep.
Watch me.
If you're doing this to annoy me, it's working.
Come here, bub.
Mommy's here.
Oh, yes, yes, yes.
What's the matter, little baby?
See, there you go again.
You're treating them like mama's boys.
Now, he's gotta stand on his own two feet.
Jess, he doesn't even know he has feet.
Babies need to feel secure.
Their personalities are affected by every decision that we make.
That's why we gotta be cool, so they'll grow up to be cool.
Beck, these kids were born to be wild.
Excuse me.
They were born to be little gentlemen.
That'll make a fine tattoo.
Beck, you're turning our kids into wimps.
I think from now on, you should let me make the parenting decisions here.
Well, that would be a good plan, except every decision you make is wrong.
Point is, I know more about raising kids than you do.
- Ha!
- Yeah.
I bet if I raised Alex and you raised Nicky my child would be perfect, and yours would be a mess.
In the words of Michelle, "please".
I can just imagine how Alex would turn out.
Oh, and I can just imagine what you would do to Nicky.
Mommy, Mommy.
Mommy, guess what?
Guess what?
What?
What is it, Alex, dear?
I have big news.
Where's Daddy?
He's in the bathroom.
Jess.
Honey.
Not now, Beck.
I'm moussing my new hair plugs.
Jess, would you stop obsessing about your hair?
Whatever you're losing on your head, you're growing on your back.
Thank God, where do you think I got these plugs from?
Daddy, Mommy, I made the team.
Oh, Alex, that's wonderful.
Oh, Jess, isn't that wonderful?
Yeah.
- Yes, isn't that great, Father?
Hey, that's terrific, son.
Getting into sports there.
Attaboy.
Yeah, what are you playing, football, basketball there?
- Chess.
- Chess.
Actually, I'm the equipment manager.
I get to carry all the pieces, and set them up before each match.
We even have a cheer.
Take your time!
Take your time!
Think, think, think!
Outmaneuver your opponent Till he's in a quandary!
That's nice.
That's a nice cheer there, son.
That quandary cheer, I like that one.
That's a terr-- What have you done to our son?
Oh, like you did such a good job with Nicky.
I thought you were gonna talk to him about riding the motorcycle in the house.
I am.
I'm gonna talk to him right now.
Son.
Hey, Ward.
Hey, June.
Hey, Beav.
Nicholas, what did I tell you about riding that motorcycle in the bedroom?
Nick is a biker, okay?
He's gotta ride his bike.
He's too young to ride in the street.
So he's gotta ride in the house.
Nick, but just be careful.
Wear a helmet when you go up and down the stairs.
I know.
Don't pop a plug.
You can tell I have plugs?
Only when I look at them.
Well, Jess, you didn't raise a mama's boy.
Well, he's just going through a difficult stage.
His life.
Mommy, I'm chafing again.
Oh, hold on one second, sweetheart.
Mommy's coming.
Turn around.
Here's the cornstarch.
What a dork.
Mommy, Nicholas just called me a dork.
You see how you messed up Alex.
Not as bad as you messed up Nicky.
Well, at least he doesn't cry.
He can't help it.
He has a rash.
If he's got a rash, he should take it like a man.
You see what'll happen if we baby these kids?
Oh, my kid would never turn out to be such a wimp.
But your kid, that was pretty scary.
That would never happen.
Are you saying your kid wouldn't be out of control?
No, I'm saying I'll never lose my hair.
If I do, I'd get one of those rugs that stays on in the wind, in the pool and everything.
Hey, Jess.
Does this baby look a little flushed to you?
Yeah, he does.
He's warm, too.
He sounds congested.
Becky, what do we do?
The kids have never been sick before.
All right, don't panic.
I'll take his temperature.
- All right, I'll get the humidifier.
- I'll call the doctor.
And I'll take him out, just in case he's contagious.
It's okay, sweetie.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Mommy's gonna take your temperature, okay?
What is taking my dinner so long?
- Are my friends looking at me?
- D.J., nobody is looking at you.
Can I wait in the car?
Honey, there is no fun happening in the car.
All the fun is right here.
Why did I order this?
Here, Michelle.
Ew, gross.
Kill it, Daddy.
Michelle, it's just an octopus, and it's already dead.
Excuse me, sir.
Would you put our little eight-legged cephalopod back in the tank, please?
Are you sure it's not my birthday?
Yes, sweetheart, for the hundredth time, it's that little girl's birthday.
That's why she gets the chocolate cake, all right?
Is she gonna eat the whole thing?
Michelle, just suck it up and move on.
Ahoy, knackwurst and potato pancakes for the landlubber.
Well, it's about time.
Hey, I know you, you're Ranger Joe from TV.
Hey, kids, look who's here.
It's Ranger Joe.
- Look at this.
There you go.
- Ranger Joe!
Kids, I'd like to sign your autographs but could you wait till after I finish my dinner?
I'm finished.
Okay, where's that pen?
Hi, D.J. Oh, hi, Shelly.
What are you guys doing here?
We thought it'd be a riot to come goof on all the lame families that come here.
That's why we're here too.
Uh-uh.
It's Tanner Family Fun Night.
I gotta tell the guys this one.
I've gotta find a new school.
Ew.
This one has eyes.
I'm sorry, but I can't eat anything that's looking at me.
You can't let all this food go to waste.
Joey, you want to eat it?
Danny, that's not dinner, it's Marineland.
A whole semester trying to be cool wiped out by one night of Tanner family fun.
Okay, that's it, we're out of here.
Check, please.
Not so fast, matey.
I spy a landlubber who hasn't finished his sunken treasure.
And that means you walk the plank.
Plank!
Plank!
Plank!
Enough.
Aargh.
- That's your favorite letter, isn't it?
- Any last words?
Yes, there's something I'd like to say to my family.
Tonight, I had a dream that people who love each other could go out together.
To laugh, to have fun, to eat fish.
But who was I kidding?
Only myself.
Okay, I'm ready now.
Dad, wait!
- What?
This is my fault.
I'm the one who ordered the Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau.
And if anyone deserves to walk the plank, it's me.
Hold on, hold on.
I should be the one who has to walk the plank.
The reason we didn't have fun tonight was because of my bad attitude.
So someone sneezed on my knackwurst, big deal.
Dad, Joey's right.
We all had bad attitudes.
I admit, when I first came here I was a little embarrassed.
But now that I'm up here, standing on a boat and seeing everybody stare at me, I'm totally humiliated.
My turn.
Sarah, are you gonna eat all that cake?
Oh, you know, this was really sweet of you guys to come up here.
This is the Tanner family fun I was hoping for.
I'll walk the plank, but not because I didn't clean my plate.
Because I came here for Tanner Family Fun Night.
And gosh darn it, we're gonna have some fun.
- Am I right, me buckos?
- Yeah.
Okay, man overboard!
Well, blow me down.
Cannonball!
Cowabunga!
- I'll go wait in the car.
- Aargh.
What the heck?
Hey, hey, thank you.
Look out.
It's okay, honey.
You're gonna be all right.
Jess, when is the doctor gonna call?
It's been over an hour.
I know.
Becky, I'm sorry.
This whole thing is my fault.
- It's not your fault.
- Yes, it is.
I should've listened to you in the first place.
I took Alex out without a hat to get pizza, and now he's got a fever.
I'm sorry.
Honey, it was Nicky you took out without a hat.
It was?
Becky, I don't know what I'm doing here anymore.
I know what you mean.
I feel like these kids should come with an owner's manual.
Hello.
Yes, Dr. Arnold.
Okay, thanks for calling back.
Listen, Alex has a temperature of 101.
Yeah, yeah.
We did the compress.
Right.
Did the humidifier.
I took the other baby out.
Yeah, right.
We did it.
Did it.
That's it?
What am I paying you for?
Just kidding.
All right, thanks, doc.
Bye.
What did he say?
He said we're doing everything right, and there's nothing else to do.
Hey, Jess, look at this.
Alex's temperature is back to normal.
We did it?
We got him through his first fever?
- Yes, and we didn't even argue about it.
- We didn't even call our moms.
Beck, I'm sorry.
I've been a real pain.
I'm sorry too.
Honey, we both want what's best for our kids and we just disagree sometimes on how to get there.
Yeah, about this parenting thing, I mean, these kids are gonna be hanging around the house for a good 18 to 19 more years.
We better come up with a plan.
Okay, instead of arguing so much, we should really listen to each other.
Then we can take the best of what each of us has to say and compromise.
That's a good plan.
Well, we make a great team.
Actually, I smell an opportunity for teamwork as we speak.
Okay, so, what do we use, partner?
- Cornstarch or baby powder?
- I say we go for a little combo platter.
All right, we'll make a very special baby butt blend.
Here we go.
I'll mix and you apply.
Oh, what a team.
All right, we're ready.
Let's take them off--
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Oh, Michelle, look at you.
Your very first cleaning belt.
Honey, it seems like only yesterday you could barely hold a Handi Wipe, and now look at you, sweetheart.
You got your own squeegee.
I'm really growing up.
Yes, you are.
You know, I'm gonna tell you a little secret.
D.J. and Stephanie, they've never really fully appreciated the beauty of tidiness.
But you, Michelle, you are the one that can carry the Tanner tradition of total cleanliness into the 21st century.
I can do it.
I know you can.
Because what are we?
We're the lean, mean, cleaning machine.
Let the spring-cleaning begin.
You know what, before we call the others in, let's practice your squeegee technique on this table right here.
Okay?
Okay, take out your squeegee.
Now, feet spread slightly apart, shoulders level.
Okay, choke up on the handle.
Now, keep your eye on the dirt at all times.
Do it, baby.
You're a natural.
I learned from the best.

Peekaboo.
Where's Mommy?
Peekaboo.
Where's Mommy?
Peekaboo.
Where's Mommy?
JOEY : Behind your hands.
What am I, a dummy?
Joey.
Joey, look!
Nicky's crawling!
My baby can crawl!
Oh, my gosh, Becky, your son's turned into a walrus.
Jess!
Jess, come quick!
Oh, your dad is gonna be so proud of you.
What?
Jess, you have to see what Nicky did.
Hey, it's your turn to change him.
No, Jess, Nicky can crawl.
Look.
Doesn't crawling involve some sort of movement?
Well, I swear, honey, he was just crawling up a storm a minute ago.
Go get the camera so we can videotape it.
All right.
Jess!
Quick!
What?
The kid's a potato.
Jess, I swear, he was really hauling tush.
Yeah, it's true, honey.
He just doesn't do it when you're around.
All right, fine.
I'll just sit here until he crawls.
Jess!
What?
Nothing.
Guess what day it is?
It's spring-cleaning day.
The happiest day of the year.
All right.
Come on, let's humor him.
It's time to clean.
Let's squeegee!
Dad, do we have to do this today?
The dirt'll be here next weekend.
Yeah, it's the first sunny day in weeks.
Don't worry, you guys are gonna get to go outside.
One of your jobs is to polish and clean the mailbox.
Hot dog.
Danny, it's your own personal Christmas.
What fun do you have in store for us today?
Well, this could be the most exciting spring-cleaning since '88.
Oh, yeah, that was the year I got to Simonize the rain gutters.
Hey, Jess, maybe you can take the rain gutters this year.
My ship has finally come in.
Okay, everybody.
It is time for the traditional handing out of the assignments.
Okay.
Excuse me.
Each area of responsibility has been personally selected to reflect the strengths and abilities of each and every member of the cleaning crew.
Aw, man, I got toilets again?
Well, who knows 'em better than you, really?
What's my job, Daddy?
What's your job?
You get to be Daddy's special helper.
I'm Daddy's special helper.
Well, pin a rose on your nose.
Okay, troops, dirt is the enemy.
We take no prisoners.
Now, get out there and make me proud.
On your mark, get set, clean!
Grab your Brillo and your broom.
Grab your Brillo and your broom.
Danny is a loony tune.
Danny is a loony tune.
Sound off How did I get stuck waxing this guy?
Hola, Tanneritos.
Hi, Kimmy.
Come on, Deej.
The football team's having a car wash.
If we hurry, we can see the entire defensive line in wet tank tops.
Sorry, Kimmy, but we're doing spring-cleaning.
Hey, dad will be happy.
There's only one wad of Joey's gum under here this year.
All right, I'm finished with the fireplace.
Let's see what's next.
Clean the logs?
Well, there.
I finished cleaning every toilet in the house.
They're spotless.
So if you have to go to the bathroom, please go to the Texaco station.
What's wrong with you people?
How can you get this house any cleaner?
It's already the cleanest house in America.
For the first time, Gibbler actually is makin' some sense.
Had to happen some time.
Fresh sponges.
Get 'em while they're hot.
Danny, we don't need sponges, all right.
We did all our jobs.
The house is clean.
We're out of here.
We'll see you later.
Bye.
Freeze!
Are you telling me you guys cleaned this entire house in two hours?
Oh, pu-lease.
Danny, we've been workin' here.
Check the statue.
Okay, I'll do just that.
Get my trusty rag out here.
Okay.
A little wax in his ear, but, uh, not bad.
Okay, let's move on.
Jesse, I believe your job was to clean the fireplace.
Special helper, white glove, please.
My pleasure.
We never clean at my house.
We move in, trash the place for five years, then move out.
Okay, here we go.
Just check in here.
Huh.
Well, what do we have here?
Yes, what do we have here?
It's just a little soot.
Just a little soot?
Did you hear that, Michelle?
I'm afraid I did.
You know, I've been making random inspections of every room in the house.
And so far I've found the following: mold, mildew, fungus, soap scum.
Not soap scum?
Yes, soap scum.
Ooh.
Guys, come on.
Once a year I ask you all to roll up your sleeves and really do a job on this house.
If you do a job, you give 100 percent.
Otherwise, let's not do a job at all.
Okay, let's not do the job at all.
Oh, come on.
I know you don't mean that.
You all take as much pride in a clean house as I do.
Let's get back out there and really clean.
And when you're all done, I got a special surprise for you.
You're taking us to Happy Mountain?
No, it's even better than that, honey.
I'm putting new shelf paper in each and every one of your closets.
Yay!
What?
Everyone, come in.
I have to tell you something.
What?
Come on.
What is it?
Is it just me, or is Dad worse than ever this year?
Hey, there's nothing wrong with your dad wanting to be a little clean.
All right, wanting to be very clean.
All right, he's a psycho with a dust mop.
It's not just the cleaning.
He gets so carried away.
He's the only parent who packs a coaster in your lunch.
What about all his rules?
Does it really matter if you chew each bite of food 24 times?
Yesterday, I only did it 22, and let me tell you, it felt good.
Well, your dad does like to pay attention to detail.
Every detail.
On every subject.
In the universe.
Mm.
What drives you crazier?
His stories or his rambles?
What's the difference?
Here you are.
Did we forget today that it was spring-cleaning?
That's another thing.
He turned our sweet little Michelle into a junior neat freak.
Do you really care if the inside of the chimney is clean?
Yes, I do.
And so does Santa Claus.
She's totally brainwashed.
Everything should be washed.
Now, let's get busy!
Poor kid.
She's really turning into Dad.
Yeah, before you know it, she's gonna start rambling.
Making up crazy rules.
Making stupid schedules.
The last thing we need around here is another Danny.
I hear ya.
Yeah.
Dad's coming down.
Line up for inspections.
Do we line up by size, alphabetically or by age?
IQ.
Joey, you're at the end of the line.
Okay, everybody, stand up straight and look clean.
Ready for inspection, O prince of tidiness.
Here's your white glove.
Uh, I won't be needing that, honey.
There's not gonna be any inspection.
No inspection?
Dad, we just cleaned for four hours.
Well, thanks, but-- Look, I'm gonna take a little drive up to the mountains and just do some thinking, okay.
So I'll be back later.
You guys just have a nice day.
Attaboy, Norman.
You're doing great.
Boy, the guy at the Rent-A-Burro place was right.
I'm glad I sprang for the midsize.
All right.
Keep going.
All right, you made it.
Good boy.
Ooh.
Oh, yeah.
This feels great.
I'm gonna start riding a burro to work every day.
Oh, man, would you look at that.
Come here, Norman.
Right there is fine.
That's fine.
You know, I've had a lot of time to think today.
Oh, man, what an eye opener.
You should've been in that closet with me.
The people I love most in the world think I'm nothing but a compulsive, neurotic, rambling jackass.
No offense.
How did I get so messed up?
I guess it goes back to my mom.
On my fifth birthday she gave me my own set of vacuum cleaner attachments.
She used to call me her special helper.
Oh, my God, that's exactly what I'm doing to Michelle.
She's-- She's probably gonna grow up and write one of those tell-all books, Daddy Cleanest.
I gotta make some changes in my life.
Norman, thanks for listening to me, buddy.
I guess you get a lot of guys who come up here just to talk, huh?
Hey, if you're ever in San Francisco, drop by for some cappuccino, okay?
Isn't this view amazing?
Oh, man, nature is just so beautiful.
It's so-- So natural, and yet so dirty.
Look at this.
There's dirt everywhere.
Look at this mountain, Norman.
It's just one big pile of dirt.
But do you animals care if the forest isn't vacuumed?
I saw what you did on the trail back there, Norman.
For you guys, nature is just one big restroom, isn't it?
You know what?
From now on, there's gonna be a new Danny Tanner.
Somebody who everybody likes and they wanna be around.
Norman, it's the dawn of a new man.
Yeah, natural, spontaneous, carefree primitive.
Join me, Norman.
Join me.
Come on, Norman.
Chime in, baby.
All right, boys, come on, crawl for your daddy, okay?
See, it's very simple.
It's-- Right hand, left knee.
Left hand, right knee.
Very simple.
Let's take off.
You guys wanna race?
Here we go.
On your mark, get set, and we out of here.
Let's go boys.
Okay, boys, come on, come--  Look, Joey.
Jess learned to crawl.
Oh, what a good boy.
I just wanna see my kids crawl.
Is that too much to ask for a father?
Jess, look!
What?
Look at this.
My boys are crawling.
They're mobile.
All right!
They're not just lumps of potatoes anymore.
They're-- They're actually like little Slinkys.
We're gonna have to babyproof the house.
That's all right, we'll dig their little gates out.
Good goin', boys, all right!
You're such a good boy.
Guys, do some laps around the playpen until we make this place safe for you.
D.J.: Dad's back!
Yeah, we just saw him pull up.
I'm home.
Hey, Danny.
How you doin'?
Whoa.
Whew.
Dad, someone has to say it.
You don't smell good.
Honey, I-- I smell like nature.
Like the mountains and the trees.
You smell like a donkey to me.
Heh.
But, hey, it's just great to have you back.
Ah, don't worry about it.
There we go.
Danny, aren't you gonna pick that up?
Sure, next time I go out.
You see, everybody, I've changed all my priorities.
You can say goodbye to Captain Clean, because from now on I'm gonna live my life totally natural.
Hm.
Naked?
Oh, great, potato chips.
Thank you.
I'm starved.
Mm.
Thank you.
Who the heck is that guy?
A man works up a powerful thirst riding a burro.
Dad, you're drinking from the milk carton.
You said that was illegal.
Well, the new law is, "Hey, it's cool".
Danny, were you kidnapped by the Grateful Dead?
Hey, who's the tall, dirty guy  who smells like a donkey?
Hola, Gibblerito.
Is that really you?
I'll find out if it's the real him.
The real Danny Tanner would not tolerate a nice glop of chocolate on his nice clean refrigerator.
There you go.
What do you say to that?
What do I say to that?
I say, hey, it's cool.
Okay, yeah, that's fine.
But what if somebody a little less mature came along and turned that little glop of chocolate into a smiley face?
Daddy, do something.
Joey's making a mess.
I'll do somethin'.
I'll add some hair.
There we go.
All right.
Perfect.
I'll find out it it's for real.
Okay, Mr. T, have a cow and toss my rear out of here.
Ah, Kimmy, I love your high jinks.
Daddy, you're scaring me.
Oh, don't worry, honey.
Your dad's just a fun-lovin' guy, not some psycho with a dust mop.
Come on, everybody.
Why don't we have some ice cream?
That'll be fun.
Here we go.
Everybody, grab a spoon.
No dishes?
No, sweetheart.
We're gonna eat this right out of the carton.
Mm.
There you go.
This is very wrong, but I'll eat it.
Dig in.
Come on, you guys.
Oh, man.
Fix this.
Here we go.
All right.
Yeah.
That looks a lot more natural.
Okay.
Dad, what are you doing?
Oh, I'm, uh-- I'm unorganizing my closet.
What kind of nut lived in here, huh?
Hey, Danny, back in the kitchen when you said: "Psycho with a dust mop".
Where'd you get that from?
Oh, I don't know.
Yes, you do.
You heard me say it, didn't you?
Okay, uh, look, I was, uh, putting shelf paper in D.J.'s closet when you all were having your little family meeting.
Ouch.
Listen, Danny, we're sorry.
We're embarrassed by that.
We didn't mean those things we said.
We were just letting off a little steam, that's all.
No, no, what you said was true.
Andyou hurt my feelings, but I'm glad I know how you really feel about me now.
And I've changed.
Let me show you.
Watch this: no more baking soda in my sock drawer.
There you go.
You girls have a brand-new dad.
I don't want a new dad.
I'll chew each bite 24 times, just like you said.
I just want my old dad back.
So do I. Who cares if you're a neat freak?
If it wasn't for you, I would never make my bed.
Me neither.
You guys really mean all this?
Danny, of course we mean it.
You keep this family running.
Yeah, you keep us organized.
I mean, there's nine people living here.
Without you, it'd be total chaos.
You know, I think I went too far the other way.
I gotta find a balance between Captain Clean and Sergeant Sludge.
And could you help Michelle find a balance?
Today, she made my bed, and I was still in it.
Yeah, I guess I better have a talk with my special helper.
But you know what, I gotta vacuum up this baking soda first, 'cause it's driving me crazy.
Now, listen, before you do that, just do us all kind of a big favor.
Take a shower.
Okay.
I'll be right out.
Michelle, I think we have to have a little talk.
I lined up all my animals.
They go to little, to big.
Look, sweetheart Why do you want your animals like that?
Because they're neat and they're clean, and that's the way you like 'em.
Sweetie, come here.
Honey, I think it's wonderful that you want things neat and clean.
But sometimes your dad likes things a little bit too neat and too clean.
And too much of anything is not good.
Even ice cream?
Yes, even ice cream.
Maybe you should be a little less like your dad and maybe a little more like your sisters.
You want me to be a slob?
No, I don't want you to be a slob.
But just because your dad likes things neat and tidy doesn't mean you have to be exactly like me.
I just want you to be Michelle Tanner.
I can do it.
Aw, that's great, honey.
Now, are you sure you want your animals to sleep like that?
Could they sleep on my bed with me?
Yeah, but only if you get in it.
Go ahead.
I'll throw them to you.
Okay?
Okay.
Here's Blinky and Pookie.
Here's Jimmy.
Okay, there's little Joel bear with the beautiful little blue ribbon.

All right, Michelle.
Now, we don't wanna drown the plants, okay?
We just want to spray 'em.
So two squirts per plant, okay.
Here we go.
One.
Two.
Whoa, whoa, ho, ho.
Oops, I missed the plant.
"Oops, I missed the plant".
You specifically aimed at my coif, young lady.
And there's only one way to handle this.
Squirt bottles at three paces.
Follow me.
We'll do it like they did in the Old West, all right.
Now, we go back to back, and we take three paces, and we turn around, and we fire, got it?
All right, here we go.
One.
Two.
Three!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
That's not how they did it in the Old West.
I never heard of the Old West.

"Thank you, Bay Area Broadcasters.
"I never dreamed I'd be honored with this, uh, prestigious award for Best Talk Show Host".
No, that sounds too rehearsed.
How 'bout, uh "What an incredible surprise!
I only wish I would've prepared a speech".
Danny, give it up.
We're never gonna win.
Every year Wake Up, San Francisco gets beaten by Up and at 'Em, Oakland.
I don't know what people see in that show.
Cheerleaders wrestling in a syrup pit.
Howdy-ho, fellow nominees.
Howdy-ho, Ranger Joe.
You guys ready for the awards show tonight?
I am so nervous.
I've never been nominated for anything in my life.
Neither has Mr. Woodchuck.
I hope we win.
Knock on wood.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi, Deej.
Hey.
Deej, where were ya?
Oh, I was just hanging out.
You're 45 minutes late.
You should've called.
Why don't you just strap a beeper collar on her and track her like a wildebeest?
Why don't you just go live with a wildebeest?
Look, Dad, I'm sorry.
But the hottest band in school is coming over to use Uncle Jesse's studio, so please don't do anything to embarrass me.
Deej, when did I ever do anything to embarrass you?
Today.
Come on in, guys.
Everybody, this is Pete.
How's it going?
Tim.
Tony and Sludge.
The Funky Tongues.
The Funky Tongues?
Boy, I could've used you guys when I was licking stamps for my Christmas cards.
Well, that took care of today.
The studio's downstairs.
Thanks.
And, D.J., you're lookin' real good today.
Thanks.
What, uh?
What did that guy mean by: "D.J., you know, you're lookin' real good today"?
I think he meant she was looking real good today.
Well, why didn't he say anything to me?
I'm lookin' real good today.
Danny, you're lookin' real good today.
* You're gonna burn * * You're gonna burn * Shop this shows fashion, download the "LookLive" app in iTunes That was, uh loud and painful.
Thank you.
All right, here we go.
You guys got yourself your very own demo.
Yes.
Thank you.
All right, way to go.
All right, okay.
Don't get too excited, now.
A demo doesn't mean you're gonna get a record deal.
Oh, that's cool.
I mean, we're just in it for the women.
And, man, this guitar is a ticket to Babeland.
Oh, you know, I, uh I got a few chicks, uh, in the old days myself.
Oh, yeah?
Did you have a band in high school?
Fourth grade.
Come on, guys.
D.J.: Hi.
Hi, girls.
Hi.
Hi.
So, Pete, I've been thinking.
Yeah.
You know what your band needs?
A couple of fly girls.
* Bop, chh, bop-bop-bop Bop, chh, bop * Come on, Deej, be a fly girl.
* Bop, chh, bop-bop, bop * Kimmy, you're flying solo on this one.
Uh, thanks for hooking us up with your uncle.
Listen, you, uh, wanna get together tonight?
Tonight?
Yeah.
It's kinda short notice.
I'm free.
On second thought, you noticed me.
I noticed you.
That's enough notice.
So, Sludge, what are you doing tonight?
Oh, here, let me help you with that.
He wants me.
Bad.
Okay, boys, now your mommy and daddy are going out, okay?
But it's just for a few hours.
So you guys gotta stay together, okay?
Don't fall apart.
Be very, very strong--  I'm gonna miss you guys so much.
Jess.
Honey, bad news.
Hm?
I just talked to Aunt Ida.
She can't babysit tonight.
What?
We have to go out tonight.
I'm having my best hair day of the year.
Deej, can you watch the twins?
Sorry, I have a date tonight.
I can do it.
I won't have a date for five years.
Steph, that's very sweet, but you know what?
You're still a little too young.
I'll do it.
Michelle, you're younger than me.
I'm just trying to help.
Give me a break.
How are we gonna find a babysitter at the last minute on a Friday night?
Hola, Tanneritos.
No.
Why not?
There you go.
Kimmy can babysit.
Why don't you just throw your kids to a pack of wolves?
Hey, I've babysat for every kid on this block.
The screaming Taylor baby, the Watson brats, and your very own squirt and squirt junior.
Don't call me squirt.
Don't call me squirt junior.
Jess, let me talk to you for a second.
Look, I think we should let Kimmy babysit.
Stephanie's backing her up, and we can call every 15 minutes.
Every 10 minutes.
All right, we have no choice.
Kimmy, you're in.
All right.
My rates are $5 an hour, but since you're in a bind, it's 7.50.
Oh, one more thing.
I don't do dogs.
I can doggysit.
Comet will do anything for a Doggy Doodle.
Here, Michelle.
Sit up.
See?
Good boy, Comet.
Hey, that's pretty good.
Will these Doggy Doodles work on the twins?
"And, everybody, I-- I'd like to thank "my orthodontist, Dr. Freidman, "uh, without whom I wouldn't have the perfect smile that I have today".
I'll get it!
Oh, by the way.
I have a date tonight.
You didn't tell me you had a date.
Hi.
Hey.
What's up?
With, uh, Sludge, isn't it?
It's Pete.
Sorry, it's kinda last minute.
Ready, Deej?
Yeah, I'm ready.
You know what?
I-- I'm not.
Uh Come here, Pete, why don't we, uh, real quick have a little father-to-new-date chat?
All right.
Dad, we're just going to a movie.
Ah, well that means that, uh, Pete, you'd be driving, huh?
Do you have, uh, auto insurance?
Collision?
Comprehensive?
Uninsured motorist?
Yeah, yeah.
I'm-- I'm covered.
Ah.
Any unpaid parking tickets?
Uh, overdue library books?
Have you had your flu shot, Pete?
I'm clean.
Ask my parole officer.
Parole officer?
It's a joke.
Chill out.
Dad, could you lay off the third degree, please?
Pete's a nice guy.
Okay.
Okay, you guys.
You have a good time.
All right.
Be back in 20 minutes.
Whoa, 20 minutes?
Hey, it's a joke.
Chill out.
Drive careful.
D.J.: Bye.
Well, how do we look?
You rented a tuxedo for your dummy?
Yeah, and he looks pretty snappy, doesn't he?
Yeah, except for the shoes.
They gave me two lefties.
Uh-oh, I'm pulling right.
I'm pulling right.
All right, let's go, guys.
This new mousse is only guaranteed 45 minutes.
Jess, about that, uh, kid Pete that you worked with today?
What do you think of him?
He's a good kid.
Ah, that's a relief.
D.J. just went out with him.
What?
You let her go out with that animal?
You just said he was a pretty good kid.
He's in a band.
All he thinks about is girls.
He's exactly how I was at 17.
Oh, my God.
Gibbler, get in here right now.
Tell me everything you know about this Pete guy.
He's a legend.
Girls throw themselves at him.
They say he's never heard the word "no".
And D.J.'s out with him?
I would love to be D.J. right now.
On her way to the drive-in in that hot black and red van.
Drive-in?
Van?
My baby.
You guys ready to go?
Yeah, we can't go.
D.J.'s at the drive-in.
In a hot black and red van.
With the lead singer of the Funky Tongues.
We gotta go get her.
Here, Beck.
We'll meet you at the dinner.
You take Mr. Woodchuck.
Come on.
Oh, oh, oh.
What are you doin'?
You try walking with two left shoes.
Aw.
Well, at least I have a date.
You behave yourself.
Good boy, Comet.
Comet did his business.
Then he gets a treat.
I wish I got a treat every time I did my business.
Let's go play, Comet.
Okay.
Let's see what's on the menu.
As if you had a choice.
Strained squash.
Ew.
I just remembered, I once had a traumatic experience with squash.
I had to eat it.
Here, you feed 'em.
It's your job.
You feed 'em.
Come on, Steph, be a bud and nourish the little drool puppies.
All right, Kimmy, I'll feed 'em.
But it'll cost you.
How 'bout a dime?
How 'bout a dollar?
Deal.
Per kid.
Burps are extra.
You guys, these shoes are killing me.
All right, all right.
We're moving, we're moving.
I can't believe someone actually went to the drive-in to watch the movie.
D.J., where are you?
Okay, all right, all right, all right, already.
Hey, guys, let's check the red van.
Can't see inside.
The windows are all steamed up.
They better be making soup in there.
All right, you two, the party's over.
Come on out.
Sorry, wrong van.
Do your parents know what you're up to?
There's the Phantom of the Prom.
Ew, he just put that piranha in the punch bowl.
D.J., this movie's lame.
Why don't we hop in the back and get a little more comfortable?
I'm pretty comfortable right here.
Oh.
That's right, I forgot.
You're a freshman.
This must be, like, your-- Your first time at a drive-in, right?
No, I come here all the time.
I was just here Sunday for the swap meet.
Come on, let's get in the back, listen to a little music for a while.
Okay?
Okay.
Boy, it sure is private back here.
Yeah, now all we need is a little romantic music.
Boy, that makes you wanna just get up and dance.
Whoa, D.J., just relax.
* You're gonna burn * * You're gonna burn * * You're gonna burn * I hear Pete's song.
* You're gonna burn * Here's D.J.'s coat.
* You're gonna burn * Pete, let's just watch the movie.
How come?
I just don't feel right about this.
All right.
That's cool.
I'll go get us some popcorn, all right.
Okay.
Be right back.
* You're gonna bu-u-u-urn *   What are you guys doing here?
We were worried about you.
Where's Pete?
He's getting popcorn.
Would you guys please leave?
I'm on a date, okay?
How come you didn't tell us you were going to a drive-in?
In Tony the Tiger's van.
Look, can we please talk about this later?
I don't want Pete to see you here.
Do you know how embarrassing this is?
Put yourself in my shoes.
I'd love to.
You got a left and a right?
Pete's coming back.
Please leave.
I-- I promise I'll tell him to take me home.
Just don't let him see you here.
Hi, Pete.
You're back.
Yeah.
Yeah, let's, uh Go ahead and get in front, all right?
Uh, wait.
Just a minute.
We should straighten up first.
I come from a very neat family.
Hello.
Hello.
I, uh-- I guess you're wondering what we're doing here in your van.
In our tuxedos, yet.
Tell him, Joey.
Well, it's, uh-- Well, Pete, it-- Heck, it's a very funny story.
And, uh, no one, uh, really tells it funnier than Jess.
Jess, tell him.
Yeah, see, it is a funny story, actually.
Well, you know what?
It's not even a story.
It's a-- You know that demo tape we were making?
Uh, I just was wondering.
You want the whole song on that tape?
You wanted the whole song, right?
Yeah.
Okay, good.
Because I-- I was-- Okay, I put the beginning, middle-- It's all on the-- We can leave now.
Yeah, we're done.
Uh D.J., why don't we just go ahead and call it a night?
Actually, you can go ahead and go home with your dad.
Okay.
Keep up the good work.
Okay, let's get you two to bed so I can hit the phone.
Ew.
Steph, would you mind disposing of the toxic waste?
Once again, it'll cost you.
All right, all right.
But do something quick, before the smoke alarm goes off.
Come here, little guy.
Ooh, boy.
Ew.
You too?
You're getting a kick out of this, aren't you?
Good boy.
You look very pretty.
Okay, you can have another treat.
Sit.
You sure like these Doggie Doodles.
They look like a cookie.
And they smell like a pork chop.
I wonder what they taste like.
Yuck.
Yuck.
I should have known.
You drink from the toilet.
Is it over?
Yeah, you can breathe now.
Hi, girls.
How are my adorable babies?
Yeah, adorable if you don't have a sense of smell.
I'm surprised your wallpaper isn't peeling.
Could you please pay me so I can go home?
Okay, Kimmy, I owe you $10.
Let me get my purse.
And, Kimmy, you owe me Let's see.
Two feeds, two burps, two number two's, and a number one.
That comes to Ten dollars.
What a rip-off.
Can we make Kimmy our regular babysitter?
Deej, we need to talk.
You can't keep giving us the silent treatment.
Okay, fine, let's talk.
I'm totally humiliated.
When this gets around school, I'll never be asked out again.
But that's what you wanted, isn't it?
I think we were doing better with the silent treatment.
Guys, wait.
All right, let's go.
D.J.!
You know we have to talk about this.
Fine.
You said I was old enough to date.
You said you trust me.
You said you had confidence in my judgment.
But you really didn't mean it, did you?
I mean, the-- The first time I go out with a guy that you don't like, you come charging in like the date police.
You completely overreacted.
All three of you owe me an apology.
I think she's right, guys.
We did get a little crazy, didn't we?
I'm going to my room.
I'm sorry, Deej.
Yeah, so am I. Me too.
It's all right.
Let's just forget about it.
Everybody makes mistakes.
Yeah.
I just hope that next time you'll think things through a little better.
Yeah.
Sorry.
I don't know what I was thinking.
I wasn't thinking either, really.
That was-- That was really wrong.
I'm sorry.
You know, Deej, one more thing.
Wait a minute.
I knew that was too easy.
Sweetheart Why did you lie to us about where you were going tonight?
I didn't lie.
I said I was going to a movie.
Yeah, but you conveniently forgot to tell us it was a drive-in movie.
With a guy who's never heard the word "no".
Did I forget to mention that?
Yeah.
Look, D.J., you're 15 years old, and you still live by the rules of this house.
And if you're gonna go on a date, you have to tell us exactly where you're going.
I just didn't want you guys to freak out.
What makes you think we would've freaked out?
I mean, just 'cause we ran around the drive-in in our tuxedo, what?
Well, I guess it's my turn to say I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
And, Deej, you going out with guys is a whole new experience for us, you know.
I mean, we just have to trust each other.
We just want what's best for you.
Thanks, guys.
Do me a favor.
No more commando raids on my dates.
All right, and no more drive-ins for a while, okay?
Deal.
Deej, are you okay?
Yeah, everything's fine.
Becky.
Oh, man, we won!
Finally, somebody has recognized our talent.
Vindicated after four long years.
Well, actually, they recognized Joey's talents.
He won for Best Children's Programming.
Oh, I don't believe it.
This is great.
Oh, vindicated after four long months.
Well, congratulations, Joey.
Thanks.
Can I just--?
Can I hold it for a second?
Sure.
Thanks.
He's an immature baby.

{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
Well, bon appétit, Michelle.
Oh, boy.
"Pasghetti".
I can show you right now a much neater way to eat "pasghetti," all right?
Just pick up your tablespoon.
That's right.
Now, using your spoon as your spaghetti helper, you put some noodles on your fork, like this, and then you turn the fork around and around and around, until you wind up with a nice, neat ball of spaghetti.
Yeah, this is much neater.
Next time, I'm making SpaghettiOs.
Keep eating.
I gotta clean you up anyway.

Gladstone.
Yeah?
Mr. Strowbridge wants to see you in his office.
Okay.
All right, uh, Teddy, Aaron, Michelle, you guys stay right here.
The boss wants to see me.
Are you in trouble?
I can't be in trouble.
I-I bought him a big, gigantic cheese log for Christmas.
Heh.
So why are you sweating, Ranger Joe?
Well, that's because I'm working under these hot lights, and sweat is the body's natural cooling system.
Heh.
You're a nervous wreck.
I knew I should have bought him the beer sausage.
Hey, Teddy, wanna play at my house today?
No.
I'm playing at Michelle's house.
She's my best friend.
Yuck!
What is your problem?
You're a girl.
Duh.
I don't play with girls.
But I'm a fun girl.
You should play at Michelle's house.
They have great stuff in their refrigerator.
Well okay.
But I better not get girl cooties.
You got a bad attitude.
She's right.
Give me five, give me five.
You sure?
He's always there.
Hey.
Hi, honey.
Check this out.
I just taught the boys how to play catch.
Honey, how can they play catch?
They just learned how to dribble.
All right.
Our kids are natural athletes.
Now, you watch this, okay?
Look alive, guys.
Here's the wind up and the pitch.
It's a Nicky and Alex double play.
All right.
These kids are headed for the big leagues.
Yeah.
Long as they can wear those bibs.
Come over here.
Good catch.
I missed you.
Come on in, kids.
Hi, Daddy.
Hey, cutie.
Mm.
Mwah.
Mwah.
Let's play superheroes.
I'll be Batman.
I'll be Superman.
I'll be the Little Mermaid.
That's not a superhero.
That's a fish.
Well, Aaron, how about if Michelle is Wonder Woman?
That's impossible.
She doesn't have black hair.
What was I thinking?
You could be Superman's mother.
What does Superman's mother do?
She lays out Superman's pajamas.
Big wow.
Come on, let's go!
Hey, superheroes no running on the steps!
Okay, let me have him.
Hm.
Come on, big leaguers, time to hit the showers.
Oh, Nicky, nice drool.
You can use that for your spitball.
Hm.
How did the show go, Joe?
Uh, the show went great.
My meeting with Strowbridge was a disaster.
He says I need a sidekick.
Uh, that's a good idea.
Instead of talking to kids all the time, you'll have an adult.
Get some snappy banter going.
You know, you're right.
There's only one guy perfect for the job.
Me?
Yes.
No.
Yes.
No.
Yes.
No.
Boy, can banter get any snappier.
Come on, Jess, you could do all the music.
Put a band together.
Be my posse.
No, no, no, no.
I-I don't wanna be some dorky ranger dressed up like an overgrown Cub Scout.
No offense.
Jess, you don't have to be some dorky ranger.
You could be somebody macho and rugged, like a lumberjack.
Lumberjack Jess.
No, Joseph, I'm not-- Lumberjack Jess.
Ah?
Yeah, I could live with that.
Plus, I need the money.
Well, great.
You start tomorrow.
Welcome aboard.
: Get it?
A board is made of wood.
Board, wood.
It's a wood pun.
I got a million of them, and you'll hear 'em all.
Ow!
* Lumberjack Jess * Okay.
* Lumberjack Jess * Get the beaver off my shoulder.
I'm not a beaver.
It's for me.
Hi, Kimmy.
D.J., why doesn't Kimmy call you on your own phone?
Oh, I just left her house.
She knew I wouldn't be upstairs yet.
You will never guess what I-- Can I have some privacy, please?
Oh, sure, I'll just go hide in the hamper for a while.
Thanks, Dad.
Oh.
No problem.
You will never guess what I heard from Kathy Santoni.
Oh, that's hilarious.
I can't believe it.
Tell me more.
And there's this rumor going around that Roxanne is stuffing her bra with two-ply paper towels.
Because during lunch today, she spilled juice on her blouse, and it absorbed--  --like that.
No kidding.
Uh-- So, Kimmy, what's going on for the weekend?
Mom's got the roller derby championships.
Wanna go?
Oh, I just remembered what I wanted to tell you.
Um, you know how Stephanie's always reading my diary and going through all my stuff?
She's the queen of the sneaks.
I've come up with the ultimate revenge.
She won't know where, and she won't know how.
But when she least expects it: boom!
What's going on?
What did she do?
No, Kimmy, I just said all that stuff because I'm gonna teach Stephanie a lesson.
No, I don't need your mother's stun gun.
I'll call you later.
I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead.
Oh, boy.
Oh, no.
Hey, Steph.
What's wrong?
You seem a little tense.
Me?
Uh-- Nope.
No tension here.
Heh.
Cool as a cucumber.
Oh, good.
Well, do you wanna go up to my room?
We can play that new computer game I got.
Your room?
Alone?
No witnesses?
I don't think so.
Okay.
Well, I'll get you-- Uh-- Catch you later.
I'm doomed.
Superman!
Batman!
Superman, Batman, your breakfast is ready.
Thanks, Superman's mother.
Your pancakes are delicious.
Let's play wrestling now.
I'm the Ultimate Warrior.
I'm the Macho Man.
Don't tell me, I'm the Macho Man's mother.
You got it.
Freeze.
It's my room, and I say we play house.
I love playing house.
Playing house is for girls.
I hate playing house.
Let's play guns.
Don't you listen?
We're playing house.
Okay.
Let's play house, and blow it up with our guns.
Baby Love Button is not a gun.
Come on, Teddy.
Come over to my house.
I got phasers.
Cool.
But what about Michelle?
Yeah, what about Michelle?
If you play with her, I'll tell the whole school that you're a girl lover.
I don't want that.
Sorry, Michelle.
Way to go, Teddy.
Come on, let's be men.
I lost my best friend.
Okay.
Now, Lumberjack Jess lives in the Enchanted Forest.
Right.
So he should be fun and magical.
And bring joy to the children of the world.
Fun, magic and joy, okay.
And have fun.
And have fun.
See.
Yeah, fun.
Yeah, yeah.
Okay.
Uh-- Uh, howdy-ho, kids.
I'm Lumberjack Jess.
I'm Tinkerbell.
Now I'm Tinkerbell.
Well, I never said sprinkle fairy dust.
Uh, fun, magical, and-- And be manly.
Strong, you know.
What do you know about being manly?
You still wear footsie pajamas.
Hey, my feet get cold.
Does that make me any less of a man?
It's not the footsies that bother me.
It's that trap door in back with the missing button.
Can I hang out with you guys?
My friends went home.
Oh, sure, Michelle, you can hang out.
Lumberjack Jess here is learning how to be a real man.
You could learn how to be a man?
I gotta see this.
All right.
You guys wanna see a manly character?
Mm-hm.
Watch this.
Okay.
I'll show you a manly character.
Hi.
I'm Lumberjack Jess.
I walk with a manly swagger.
Because I have a manly job.
I like to pull up my manly pants.
Scratch my manly scratch.
And when I see a friend, I like to give him a manly punch.
Yo, Joseph.
And then, I like to have a laugh at his expense.
I have a question.
What makes boys different than girls?
There's-- Well, okay.
--boys-- Y-yeah, boys and g-- Girls and then Take the birds and the bees for-- And flowers.
Right, and throw in flowers-- Flowers.
Yeah, you know-- Why don't you just tell her?
Michelle, you know, uh, a question like that can only be answered by a manly man.
Take it, Jess.
Ahem.
All right, uh, so  What you're asking is, uh, what's the difference between, uh, boys and-- And girls, right?
That's the question.
What's the answer?
Yeah, I figured you'd be asking that.
All right, well, uh, okay, there's a lot of differences.
For instance, uh, boys get to lead when you dance.
Um Oh, right.
See, boys can grow a little mustache and a little beard.
And, oh, the best part is-- The best part is, at a concert, or, say, a ball game or something, the lines at the men's room are so much shorter.
Being a boy sounds like fun.
Phew.
It's the funnest.
So, uh does that answer your question?
Yes, it does.
Oh, thank God.
Stephanie.
I have something for you.
I don't want it.
Yes, you do.
Here.
What's wrong?
It's your favorite dessert.
A double-fudge-chocolate homemade brownie just for you, my loving sister.
I baked it myself.
You want me to eat that?
Sure.
You mean, chew it up and swallow it, and have it go through my bloodstream?
Steph, you're acting like I'm trying to poison you or something.
Try it.
It's really good.
Well, thank you, D.J. I'll just take this non-poisonous brownie and throw it out in the backyard!
Because I know you're out to get me.
What are you talking about?
I listened in on your phone call.
Stephanie, I'm shocked.
What did you hear?
Your evil plot.
But it's gonna take more than a brownie to do me in.
I already did you in.
Huh?
Huh.
I saw you eavesdropping, so I made up all that revenge stuff just to drive you crazy.
Well, it just so happens it worked.
Well, I hope you learned your lesson.
I sure did.
Your personal life is your own business.
And I'll never listen in on your phone calls again.
Good.
I'll just read about it in your diary.
What?
Oh, nothing.
Come on in, kids.
Hey, Michelle!
Teddy and Aaron are here.
Why are we here?
Michelle said she had a big surprise for us.
Oh, yeah.
It better be good.
Hey, Teddy.
Yo, Aaron.
Michelle what are you doing?
I'm a boy now.
Let's play guns.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Last one up the stairs is a girl.
Whoa!
Danny, what's going on?
Michelle just said she's a boy.
Oh, Danny, don't worry.
When I was Michelle's age, I was a real tomboy.
Didn't you ever go through a phase like that?
You know, uh, one Halloween, I ac-- I actually wanted to be Julie Andrews.
That doesn't leave this room.
No problem.
Bang!
Bang!
Bang!
Bang!
I got you, Teddy!
Teddy, are you hurt?
What are you doing?
I'm being the nurse.
This man has a serious owie.
Hey.
I thought you said you were a boy.
So?
A boy can be a nurse.
Let's get out of here.
She's not a real boy.
I guess you're right.
Nice try, Michelle.
Hey, you kids having fun?
Bang!
Bang!
Bang!
Get the giant!
I got you.
No.
Lucky for me, I just sprayed myself with my anti-ray-gun repellent.
You were right.
He is strange.
Michelle, I didn't mean to break up your game.
I'm a crummy boy.
Hm.
That's because you're a girl.
Why are you trying to be a boy?
Because Teddy doesn't want to play with girls anymore.
Oh.
So that's what's going on here.
Looksweetheart, I know you feel bad about this, but you gotta understand.
Teddy is just going through a stage right now.
What's a stage?
Well, a stage is when you go through something.
And then, eventually, you grow out of it.
You once went through a stage where you didn't like cake.
No way.
It only lasted 10 minutes, but, uh you get the idea.
Teddy right now is going through his I-don't-wanna-play- with-girls stage.
I don't like this stage.
Oh.
I know.
But don't you worry.
Before you know it, all the boys are gonna wanna play with you all the time.
And that's when I go through my keep-away-from-my-daughter stage.
I just want my best friend back.
Sweetheart, if he's really your best friend, he'll come back around.
Because real friends like you for who you are.
Who am I?
Who are you?
You are Michelle Tanner.
You are one terrific person.
You're sweet, you're funny you're friendly, you're kind Keep going.
Hm.
I could go on forever.
You always do.
Come on, Teddy.
Sit with the boys.
Okay.
Don't have a cow.
Hi, Michelle.
Hello, Theodore.
Hi, my name's Michelle.
My name's Denise.
Do you like boys?
Nah.
Boys are gross.
Yeah, boys are gross.
Okay, kids, come on, let's put those tongues away, and let's put on our happy faces.
Okay, we're on in five, four, three, two * Ranger Joe * CHILDREN : * Ranger Joe *  * He's the greatest guy I know * CHILDREN : * Ranger Joe * Howdy-ho, Junior Rangers.

Junior Rangers, it's a very special day here in the Enchanted Forest.
Say hello to my new sidekick, Lumberjack Jess.
I told you.
They're laughing because of this stupid hat.
Oh-ho.
They're not laughing at your hat.
Yes, we are.
Is, uh, something wrong, Lumberjack Jess?
Yeah.
I feel like a lumber jackass.
Listen, uh-- Uh, Ranger Joe, I don't really, uh-- I don't really fit into this Enchanted Forest thing.
Oh, sure you do.
Heh.
You signed an enchanted contract.
Heh.
Oh, that's right.
And I do need that enchanted paycheck.
Mm.
All right, kids, you wanna see the real Lumberjack Jess?

Because, well, that's all I can move.
Okay, Lumberjack Jess, take us home.
JESSIE AND  * Ranger Joe * * Ranger Joe *  * Be back tomorrow With a brand new show * * Ranger Joe *  And we're clear.
Great show.
Let's go have fun.
Hey, where are you going?
To play with my new best friend.
What's your name again?
Denise.
Denise.
And you can't play with us.
Why not?
Because you're going through a stage.
I am?
You just wanna play with boys.
No, I don't.
Aaron's too bossy.
Do you wanna be my best friend again?
I really do.
Yay!
The stage is over!
Let's go play at my house.
Teddy!
Are you a girl lover?
Yep.
See you.
Hey.
Can I come too?
Okay.
We're playing hide-and-seek.
Thanks, Michelle.
You hide, and we'll find you.
Maybe.

Girls, as you know, in my youth, I was a Honeybee.
Now, I'm not the kind of person who likes to brag, but, huh, my hive voted me Queen Bee and retired my antennas.
Sounds like bragging to me.
Okay, all you Honeybees, it is time right now to welcome into the hive a new honey of a bee, let's hear it for Michelle Tanner.
"Plea-zzz" save all your buzzing until the end.
Okay, it is time right now for me to present to you, Michelle, the official Honeybee sash.
You know, honey, I-I can't believe you're my last little baby bee.
You know, I've put three bees through the hive.
I don't mean to drone on, but who better to drone with than a bunch of bees, huh?
Daddy, my sash.
Oh.
Right.
Sorry.
Excuse your antennae.
There you go.
How come I don't have any badges?
Because you have to earn them by doing projects.
You know, I had so many badges, I had to wear two sashes.
In fact, I earned a badge for earning the most badges.
Somebody's bragging again.
* Oh, Lumberjack Jess And Ranger Joe * * Friends forever Wherever they go * * Through thick and thin They'll never part * * One has hair The other has heart * What do you think?
You're fired.
What?
Fire-- Oh-- Oh, yeah, I get it, you want your name first.
You're such a baby.
* Ranger Joe-- * Uh, Jess, Jess.
Forget about the music.
You're still fired.
What?
There's been some big budget cuts down at the station, and they decided you're out.
I almost said to 'em, "Hey, if he goes, I go".
But I really like it there.
You're really firing me?
I'm fired?
Why are-- Fire him!
Get rid of the woodchuck.
Look, I'll do the dumb jokes, I'll wear the stupid outfit.
I'll do anything but sit on your hand.
Jess, look, I don't know how to break it to you, but, uh, we don't pay him a salary.
He's a puppet.
What am I doing?
I'm begging to be on a kiddie show.
I'm jealous of a bucktoothed beaver.
Nah, this wasn't my dream, to be on a kiddie show.
I-- You know what, this is a sign.
I'm gonna put all my energy right back into my music.
You know what?
I just heard of this new label, Fat Fish Music.
I'm gonna put a great demo together and get it to them right away.
You know what, thanks.
You actually did me a favor.
Yeah, my pleasure.
If I'd known you'd be so happy, I would've fired you weeks ago.
Boy, Deej, you sure are going to a lot of mucho trouble.
Well, I have to get my dad in the mood.
I can't just say, "Dad, I'm going to Spain".
He worries when I say, "Dad, I'm going to the mailbox".
My parents were really excited when I told them about Spain.
They already bought me a one-way ticket.
Okay, everybody, you can come down now.
She said, "Hello, my family".
Whoa-ho.
Qué pasa?
He said, "Whoa-ho.
What's happening"?
She either said "Dinner's ready," or "It's time to clip your nose hairs".
Okay, Deej.
What do you want, how much is it gonna cost me, and why is the dog wearing a hat?
Well, there's this summer study program in Barcelona.
No.
I'll get to live with a Spanish family.
No.
I'll study the language and expand my horizons.
No.
Doesn't that sound exciting?
No.
So you're not saying that I'm not allowed not to go, right?
What'd you just say?
I don't know.
I just wanted to get you off that "no" thing.
Ah, Danny, come on.
At least think about it.
I mean, this is D.J.'s chance to learn about a new culture.
Yeah, come on, Danny.
Remember that one summer when we took that trip together?
Joey, we rode our bikes to Oakland.
Dad, when D.J.'s in Spain, can I have her room?
Oh that's very caring.
Deej, this is a big decision.
I need some time to think about it.
Dad, please.
This is a once- in-a-lifetime opportunity.
Don't worry, Mr. T., I'll be with her every minute, as we sample the art, the music, the tango.
Come on, Mr. T., we want to see the world.
All right, Kimmy.
Let's start with the back door.
Adios.
Olé.
Look, why don't we just sit down for dinner.
I'm serving paella.
Muy bueno.
Ooh.
Muy bueno.
Who's ready for dessert?
Michelle's trying to earn her first Honeybee badge for cooking.
You gotta taste it.
Well, I guess it wouldn't hurt to have dessert as an appetizer.
I call it Michelle's pudding surprise.
Ooh, sounds delicious.
What's the surprise?
I think it's cheese.
Surprise!
Michelle, you put cheese in the pudding?
Velveeta.
And that's not all.
Mm.
Olives.
Don't you like it?
No, it's-- It's very different, honey.
Boy, it's good.
Mm-mm.
Mm-hm.
Then how come nobody's swallowing?
Hey, everybody.
DANNY AND  Hey.
Hi, honey.
Oh.
Fiesta.
Cool.
How'd it go at the record company?
So far, so good.
At least they heard of me.
They're gonna listen to my tape and get back to me.
Let me tell you guys something.
I have a feeling something good's gonna happen.
Eww.
But that's not it.
That was awful.
Michelle cooked it.
I was trying to get my Honeybee badge.
Oh, I didn't say awful.
No, no, no.
I said awfully good.
Boy, that's awf-- You know what-- In fact, I'm gonna have some more.
Here we go.
See that.
Hm-hm-hm-hm-hm.
Velveeta?
And, uh olives, is it?
You could stop eating.
I know you don't like it.
You know, Michelle, you know what.
We'll give it to, uh We'll give it to Comet.
Hey.
Comet will like it.
He likes anything.
Here you go, Comet.
Shop this shows fashion, download the "LookLive" app in iTunes I guess it needed more olives.
Are you laughing?
Are you laughing?
Look at that.
What's that?
Can you--?
Feel that.
See that bunny's tail?
See that?
What's up?
Oh, can you feel that?
It's soft, huh?
It's soft like your big jelly belly.
Give me that thing.
Ah, ah.
The hair, the hair.
Let go of the hair.
I know you're jealous.
Hey.
Give me that.
Gimme, gimme, gimme that.
Becky, what color is that hair?
It's, uh  gray.
What?
Well, it's, uh, a light shade of black, resembling the color gray.
I have gray hair?
Well, just a couple of them.
What?
A cou-- Coup-- Here.
Here.
Here you go.
Stay right there.
How can I have gray hair?
I'm only twenty-nine.
I can't have gray ha-- Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho.
Yank 'em.
Yank 'em.
Yank 'em.
Well, okay.
They say for every gray hair you pluck, two grow in its place.
Drop that hair.
Jess, would you relax?
So you have a couple of gray hairs.
At least you still have your hair.
Yeah, but for how long?
I feel it receding.
I'm-- You know what?
I'm feeling it in my sleep.
I know how to check for this.
I know how to check.
Oh, my God.
It's moved 4 millimeters north.
Beck, I'm gonna have one of those foreheads that start at my eyebrows and go all the way to the back of my neck.
Ah, see.
Word's out.
It's probably the Hair Club for Men.
Talk to me.
Oh.
Sure I'll hold.
It's David Janolari from Fat Fish Music.
Yes, Mr. Janolari.
Hello.
Oh-- Uh-huh.
Oh.
Well thanks for crushing my dreams so fast.
All right.
That's okay.
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
He said they like my music  they like the sound, they like the look.
They just don't hear a hit single.
Jess, look, I know it's disappointing.
But you can't let it get you down.
You know what, I have an idea.
How about tomorrow you and me and the boys spend the day together?
Come down to the studio, okay?
The Beach Boys are gonna be on the show.
Come on, they're your friends.
Like, I wanna be around them.
They had hit records when they were 18.
I'm almost thirty, I got nothing.
Jess, life is not a contest.
Honey, things happen when they're supposed to.
No.
Time's running out.
So is my hair.
This is so frustrating.
I mean what happens if I never make it in the music business?
Dad, come on.
The suspense is killing me.
Can I go to Spain with Kimmy or not?
I know when you're trying to make a decision that could change the entire course of my life, the last thing you want to be is pushed.
Soyou won't catch me pushing you.
No sirree.
No pushing here.
Deej.
I know.
I'm pushing.
I'm backing off.
Sweetheart, I told you.
I've just-- I gotta think about this a little more, okay?
Oh.
Deej.
Have you seen your Uncle Jesse?
He's upstairs.
Oh, great.
Jess!
Come on down!
I'm kind of busy.
Jess, this is really important.
Come on down now.
Deej.
Uncle Jesse is gonna flip.
Mike and Bruce from the Beach Boys are here.
I promised them some good old-fashioned home cooking.
Quick, call Chicken on Wheels.
Come on in, you guys.
Oh, hi.
Hey, when do we eat?
Thirty minutes or less.
Ha!
She's a kidder.
Jess!
What, Becky?
What's so important?
Whoa-ho-ho-ho-ho!
The Beach Boys.
Whoa-ho-ho-ho-ho!
Miss Clairol.
Hey, Doctor Love, how you doing?
How ya doing?
Bruce.
How ya doing?
It's the Beach Boys.
And I-- And I got my-- Thanks for the warning.
Well, how did I know you'd be dying your hair?
Why are you dying your hair?
Because I'm worth it.
Well, honey, Mike and Bruce came over because they heard you had a new studio, and they'd like to jam.
Cool.
And eat Becky's home cooking.
Becky can cook?
I mean, huh-- Boy.
Hey, when she cooks, look out.
That's cool.
You want to play?
That's great.
I'll call the guys.
They'll be over in 10 minutes.
It'll be good too, 'cause it'll give me time to comb out and rinse.
Otherwise, I'll streak.
* If every word I said, Could make you laugh * * I'd talk forever * * Ooh * * Mmm-mm-hm * * I asked the sky Just what we had * * Ooh, it shone forever * * Oh-ho * : * Forever Forever * * I've been so happy Loving you * Ha-ha!
Woo!
You guys, that was totally excellent.
Totally.
Let's eat.
That is such a cool song.
I sang that song to Becky at our wedding.
I'll tell you, you know, if I had a song like "Forever", I'll bet you Fat Fish Records would sign us  like that.
You want it.
You got it.
Leon, please pass the coleslaw.
You mean it?
Uh-- We can record "Forever"?
Sure.
As long as Becky keeps cooking up food like this.
Oh.
Well, I'll give you the phone number.
I mean, recipe.
Oh.
Well, I mean, this is cool.
That-- That would be great if we did that.
Yeah.
I mean Normally we record stuff that we write.
But, quite frankly, who's buying it?
I mean, you know what, Elvis never recorded anything he wrote.
I wonder what it would've been like if Elvis had-a done a Beach Boys song.
* If everybody had an ocean, Across the U.S.A. * That's scary.
How about it like this though.
* If everybody Had an ocean *  * Ooh * * Across the U.S.A. * * Ooh * * Then everybody'd be surfing * * Ooh * * Like Californ-i-a * * Ooh * * You see 'em wearing Their baggies * * Huarachi sandals too * * Ooh *  Hang ten!
* A bushy Bushy blond hairdo * * Ooh * * Surfin' U.S.A. * * Ooh * Hey, munchkin.
Give me a good-luck kiss.
I've got this great version of "Forever" that I cut with the Beach Boys.
I'm taking it down to Fat Fish Records.
I'm telling you something, they gonna love this baby.
Will you taste my new recipe?
Oh.
That sounds tempting.
All right, you know what, I'll take just a really tiny, little sample.
Just give me a little tiny sample, okay?
Here we go.
Mm.
Hm-hm.
Interesting.
What is it?
Tuna cream.
So, that would be tuna and?
Oreo ice cream.
Ah-ah-ah.
Ah.
I'll never get my cooking badge.
Oh.
Now, come on.
I don't want to hear that kind of talk.
I mean, well, tuna cream may not be one of the 31 flavors but you gotta have perseverance.
Perse-- What?
Perseverance.
It means, you know, you never give up.
You keep on trying.
I mean, look at your Uncle J. Now, I've been plugging away at this music business for ten years.
I've been writing songs, taking goofy gigs.
You know why?
Because I will do anything to keep my dream alive.
* We're caught in a-- * * I can't walk out * * Because I love you Too much baby * * I said buy me those Kitty Krispies, man * * And I'll be Your best friend * * Meow-wow, meow-wow Meow-wow, meow-wow * * Oh, hey there, Mr. Egghead You scientific dude * * Whenever you're around * * I'm in a scientific mood * * You can tell us How the bird flies * * Or how the fungus grows * * The creation Of the universe * * Or how we blow our nose *  * The farmer in the dell The farmer in the dell * * Viva Las Dairy-o The farmer in the dell * * The cheese stands alone The cheese stands alone * * Hunka hunka stinky cheese The cheese stands alone * * When you're laughing * * Scooby-dooby-doo * * Oh, when you're chuckling * * Scooby-doo-doo * * Ah, the sun it is a come A-shinin' through * One, two, three!

You were desperate.
I'm hip.
I never gave up.
You know why?
Because I got what?
Perseverance.
Right on, munchkin.
Ha-ha.
All right, let me give you a little tip now.
All right, you like pudding, you like cheese, so you put 'em together.
You like ice cream, you like tuna, again, you put 'em together.
Stop putting things together.
You gotta lose the combo deal.
Just try one thing.
Try something simple.
Thanks, Uncle Jesse.
I love you.
I know.
I love you too.
I know.
What was I thinking?
It needs olives.
Dad, would you please tell me if I can go to Spain.
Okay, look.
I've been thinking about Spain.
You gotta understand, this is a big decision.
It's a decision that I've been wrestling with all day.
And if you know anything about wrestling, which I do, because I was dorm champ in the 145-pound class You know, I was really wiry back then too.
They used to call me the human pipe cleaner.
Forget it, Deej.
You're not going.
Not necessarily.
Sometimes when he rambles it's good news.
How would you know?
He never gets to the news.
Kimmy, don't be rude.
He might change his mind.
We don't know what he's gonna say.
Maybe we want him to change his mind.
Maybe he hasn't made up his mind.
Maybe you want me to lose my mind.
Dad, I can't take it anymore.
Just tell me either way.
Okay.
You promise you'll write me every day?
Of course.
I'll bring stationary, a penc-- I'm going?
!
You're letting me go?
Thank you!
Good decision, Mr. T. She already told the school yes.
Well, I said, "Yes, unless my Dad says no".
Okay, follow me.
OJs on a stick.
Get 'em while they're cold.
Ooh, thank you, sweetie.
All right.
Oh, look at that.
Okay, boys.
Are you ready to taste your first popsicle?
Ooh.
That's good, huh?
Happy tongue.
Fruity, sophisticated, yet mischievous.
Heh-heh.
And best of all, it comes on a stick.
You mean it?
You really like 'em?
Yeah.
Well, guess what?
The incredibly talented chef who made OJs on a stick, is our very own Michelle Elizabeth Tanner!
I did it!
I can cook!
Congratulations, honey.
You're gonna get your first Honeybee badge.
Thank you.
I may open a restaurant.
Hey, everybody.
This is, uh, David Janolari from Fat Fish Music.
How ya doing?
Hi.
Hey, a real family.
Cool.
This guy has the best ear in the music business.
That's strange.
Yesterday you said he wouldn't know good music if it bit him on the-- Whoa.
Heh-heh.
Kids.
Don't you love 'em?
Huh.
Listen, you aren't gonna believe this.
That's why I brought David.
If he says it, you have to believe it.
Tell 'em.
Well, I heard the kid's tape of "Forever" and it blew me away.
I'm not even here.
I had no choice.
I had to sign him.
Honey, you signed.
Congratulations!
Congratulations.
I'm finally gonna have a record out.
Ten years of struggling has finally paid off.
'Cause you got perseverance.
Cool kid.
Hey Jess, cat.
Let's rap.
When you think of major superstars like Michael Jackson or Hammer, what do you see?
Funny pants?
No, no, no, no.
You see dancing.
I do?
Of course you do.
That is why we are gonna take that sweet little song of yours, re-record it, turn up the energy, pump up the beat, and make the hottest dance video ever to hit MTV.
Uh, Dave-- Cat.
Heh.
Uh, there's just one small problem.
Um I don't dance.
Ah, come on, a guy with your looks and talent?
Can't dance?
I don't believe it.
Believe it.
Our dog Comet's better.
Anyway, don't worry about it.
'Cause when we get through with you, everyone in this country will be dancing  "the Jessman".
Jessman?

Nicky, take it easy.
Save some room for the Peking duck.
Just a little, uh, pre-solid food humor.
Oh, I can't believe I have to go back to work already.
I'm gonna miss my pookey bears so much.
Aw, well, you'll see them in an hour.
You're puttin' 'em on your show today.
Yeah, but what if they do something cute?
What if they learn to talk?
I'll have 'em call you.
Okay, let's roll.
Today's our big "Farewell Vicky Show".
And?
And our even bigger "Welcome Back Becky Show".
You and Vicky were going pretty hot there.
I thought you'd be down about her leaving.
Down?
Me?
Mr. Up?
Mr. Life-of-the-Party?
Oh, yeah, man, let the good times roll.
Why'd she have to go?
Morning, everyone.
Morning.
Good morning.
What are we lookin' at, Ranger Joe?
Nothin'.
I have a stiff neck.
Boy, sure hope my neck loosens up before my show or it's gonna be bird-watching day.
Yeah, we can look for woodpeckers.
Well, Joey, keep your chin up.
Heh, guess you have no choice.
Ha!
Forget it.
You cannot borrow my clothes.
Please?
No.
Please?
No.
Please, please, please?
I'll do it.
No, no, no.
Remember, my clothes are untouchable, off-limits.
This means you.
Understand?
I understand.
Not.
I'm wearing D.J.'s sweater.
She's gonna have a cow.
All right.
Lunches.
Kisses.
All right, have a good day at school.
Doing all right, boys, huh?
Uh-- Don't get up.
I'll get it.
Talk to me.
Speaking.
Oh.
Guys, it's the record company.
Tell me you love the song.
You like the song?
Oh, well, then maybe you can learn to love it.
I mean, as a kid, like, I hated blue cheese.
I thought it was like eatin', like, sweat socks, but-- No, really.
But eventually, I-- Right.
Okay.
I'm sorry too.
Bye.
Boys, your old man got rejected again.
But you still love me, right?
That's what I thought.
Now, we're all in the same boat.
Out-of-work high-fives.
Out-of-work high-fives, come on.
* Wake up!
* Wake up, San Francisco.
I'm Danny Tanner.
And I'm Vicky Larson.
And today is my last day because Rebecca Donaldson is back from maternity leave.
I'm gonna miss you, Danny.
Oh, Vicky.
You know, I just forgot, we're still on camera.
But, uh, Vicky, I have a big surprise for you.
I spoke to our station manager, and he wants you to do the weather reports right here on Wake Up, San Francisco.
Isn't that wonderful?
Uh, i-it would be except this morning, I was offered an incredible job anchoring the news in Chicago.
Chicago?
The Windy City?
Y-- You'll-- You'll have to wear a hat.
You'll get hat hair.
Uh, Danny, why don't we talk about this after the show because Rebecca's waiting to come on-- Chicago?
Didn't they have a really big fire there?
It was over a hundred years ago.
I'm sure it's out by now.
Hi, I'm Rebecca Donaldson, and I'm welcoming myself back to the show.
Welcome back, Becky.
Why, thank you, Becky.
Welcome back.
Welcome back.
Thank you.
Thank you, Vicky.
Thank you very much.
Um, I would like all of our viewers to meet the two reasons that I've been out of work for the last eight weeks: Nicky and Alex.
Come on in, boys.
Aw.
Hi.
Hi, baby.
Aw, come.
And, everybody, this is my wonderful husband, Jesse.
Say hello, honey.
Hello, honey.
And these are our boys.
They're identical twins.
Oh, except Alex has a birthmark on his tushy just like his daddy.
I'm outta here.
Oh, no.
Honey.
Honey.
Come on.
I am so proud of this guy.
Do you know what he's gonna do today?
Mm.
He is going to take care of the kids, do the shopping, do the laundry, and cook us a wonderful dinner.
Yeah, right after that, I'm gonna wrestle a bobcat with my bare hands.
Have mercy, 14 pounds.
You guys been sneaking down to the kitchen, eatin' cheeseburgers at night?
All right, there you go.
Here we go.
Uh, fellas, you see this?
This is what you're gonna look like if you don't start growin' hair.
Come on.
I got our dinner, Uncle Jesse.
Whoa, h-h-hold it.
I'm not buyin' all that junk food.
You better buy these cookies.
I already ate four.
I mean, five.
Billy Bunny cereal.
I gotta have it.
H-h-hold it, Michelle.
Hold it, Michelle.
Let me tell ya something.
Just because there's some goofy character on the box, it doesn't mean the product's any good, all right?
Oh, my God.
Elvis peanut butter.
Uncle Jesse, isn't that the same thing as Billy Bunny cereal?
No, it is not.
Elvis is a man, not a cartoon.
Now, what do you guys want?
Smooth or Hunka Hunka Chunka?
We'll take both.
All right.
Hey, Nicky, how you do--?
Whoa-ho-ho.
Did we bring any diapers?
Diapers, aisle three.
All right, I got an idea.
Come here, pal.
Here we go.
Here, this ought to keep you smelling pine fresh till we get there.
All right, girls, we need milk and bread.
Got it.
No more junk food.
Shop this shows fashion, download the "LookLive" app in iTunes Hey, I saw you on TV this mornin'.
Really?
Thank you.
You're, uh, Rebecca's husband, Jesse Donaldson.
It's Katsopolis.
Jesse Katsopolis.
Whatever.
I'm George, and it's nice to meet another househusband.
I'm not a househusband.
I'm a-- I'm a musician.
Yeah, I'm a screenwriter.
Look, I-- I'm just doing this because my career's temporarily on hold, okay?
Yeah, you know, I said the same thing to my wife when she went back to work.
That was four years ago.
So--?
So for four years, all you've done is take care of the kids and the house?
Of course not.
I mean, there's, uh, shopping and carpools and, oh, my favorite soap, General Hospital.
Listen, I-I gotta run.
I'll see you Thursday, double-coupon day.
If I could sleep Wednesday night.
Hm, these Funky Franks are pretty good.
I better try a few more just to make sure.
Uh-oh.
What have I done?
I got mustard on D.J.'s sweater.
She's gonna have a cow.
Tell me something I don't know.
Yesterday, I dropped your toothbrush in the toilet.
All right, come on girls, let's go.
All we need are paper towels.
I'll get one.
Wait, h-h-h-h-hold it, Michelle.
Hold it, hold it, hold it.
I'm just trying to help.
Well, thank you, but you never take from the bottom.
Always take from the top.
Like this, you see?
I could've done that.
I set the table, Uncle Jesse.
Thank you.
I'm too full to eat dinner, Uncle Jesse.
Now, I know why they call 'em Funky Franks.
All right.
Michelle, take one plate away.
Now you see it, now you don't.
That's my laundry.
I'm gonna go check on the boys.
I'll be right back.
I threw D.J.'s sweater in.
I hope that mustard stain came out.
It shrank!
That will fit my Barbie.
Hi.
Deej, my loving sister.
How nice to see you.
I'm just going to go in the living room and, uhoh, uh, practice my moonwalk.
Steph, the '80s are over.
Oh, girls, just in time for dinner.
Oh, sorry, Uncle Jesse, but Kimmy and I are gonna go study at the library.
We'll catch a burger on the way.
Is that the thanks I get after slaving over a hot stove all day?
Boy, you sound just like my mom.
Only more bitter.
There goes another plate.
Hey, Jess.
Did you, uh, lose something?
Yeah, the use of my neck.
I tried to crack it myself.
Do you know, it's amazing how many people need shoeshines.
Where's Becky and Danny?
Oh, they said to tell you they had to work late, and they'll be late for dinner.
Michelletwo more plates.
Why do I even bother?
Well, I gotta go see a chiropractor, so I'm not gonna be here for dinner either.
Michelle: What is this, a joke?
Hey, Jess, can you do me a favor and sew this button onto Mr. Woodchuck?
Oh, love to.
Boy, this floor needs a wax job.
Not only am I Mr. Mom, I'm Mr. Woodchuck's mom.
What a day.
Are you totally bummed?
Yeah, totally.
Go ahead, tell me all about it.
I just-- I'm just afraid, you know?
What if I never get a record deal?
I mean, is this it for me?
Cooking, cleaning, watching the kids while Becky's at work?
I gotta make some changes in my life.
Can we eat dinner first?
Sure, kid.
I hope you're hungry, because, uh, it's just you and me eatin'.
I think you forgot somebody.
Bon appétit, Comet.
All right, there.
Your button's on, ya sawdust-sucking tree freak.
Oh, you have no snappy comebacks since Joey's hand's not up your back, huh?
That's what I thought.
Hi, honey.
Hi.
I'm sorry I missed dinner.
That's okay.
Hello, boys.
I tell you, Jess, I-I know I should be happy about Vicky's new job in Chicago, and I am.
But I-I'm feeling a little guilty that I'm not happy enough, you know?
I think I hid my feelings pretty well, although I did weep all over her goodbye ice cream cake.
I'm fine about this, I-- I-- I really am.
Just  Do you guys know a good therapist?
I'll be leaving now.
He's taking it well.
Yes, he is.
So, honey, how was your day?
Well, the record company called.
They didn't like my demo.
Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry.
Eh, it's all right.
I'm shaking things up.
I got myself a gig tonight.
I'm playing with an oldies band at the airport lounge.
The airport lounge?
Mm-hm.
Honey, isn't that a step down?
From unemployment?
Nah, it's music, it's a paycheck.
Besides, I get a real nice coloring book and those little wings.
Honey, I've been gone all day.
I mean, this was supposed to be our time together.
Well, this is my time to make some money for my family.
Jesse, I make more than enough money to support our family.
Thanks for reminding me.
What--?
You have some problem with me making a decent living?
No, I have a problem with me making a decent living.
Oh, okay, so now I know what argument I'm in.
This is about your stubborn macho pride.
What pride?
I don't have any pride.
I lost my pride.
I'm going to get some pride.
Say goodbye to Mr. Donaldson.
Hey, Steph, have you seen the heating pad?
In Dad's top drawer.
You know he preheats his socks in the winter.
How's your neck, Joey?
Oh, it's much better.
I just can't make any sudden moves.
Look what fits me.
Michelle!
What?
Oh, I just threw my neck out again.
Way to go, stupid.
Hey, I have the exact same sweater in my closet.
Well, it's a small world after all.
And that one has a button missing right where this one has a button missing.
Can someone explain this?
I just wear 'em.
I don't shrink 'em.
Steph?
All right, this is your sweater.
I stole it, I stained it, I shrunk it.
I should've buried it.
Okay, D.J., have that cow.
I'm so sorry, D.J. I'll do anything to make it up to you.
Well, make it up to Kimmy.
I borrowed that sweater from her last summer.
Oh, yeah, that is my sweater.
So, Steph, you'll do anything to make it up to me?
This is my worst nightmare.
Okay, Kimmy, I deserve this.
What do you want?
Well, actually, I haven't had a pedicure in my whole life.
D.J., MICHELLE &  Ew, gross.
Not the sock!
Run for it!
* Glow, little glowworm Glimmer, glimmer * * Glow, little glowworm Glimmer, glimmer * * I got a gal That I love so * * Glow, little glowworm * * Glow * Thank you, and do you know what?
Thank you.
Well, welcome to the terminal lounge, the hippest room on the departing level.
We are The Diplomats and no, you're not in an elevator.
Thank you, Irv, I love you.
What are you guys doing here?
Well, we thought we'd come down to see you.
I thought you said this was an oldies band.
I get it.
Talk to you after the set.
MAN : Flight 19 to Chicago is now boarding at Gate 6.
Hey, buddy.
What are you starin' at?
Oh, I'm not staring, I just have a stiff neck.
You want me to adjust it for ya?
I'll just adjust my chair.
Okay, for our next number, we have a v-- Oh, yes, sir, you have a request there?
Yes, sir, what would you like to hear?
Watch my luggage while I go to the john.
Who wrote that one?
Gershwin?
Hit me, Irv.
Okay.
Well, then, uh, we'll do this song.
I-I'm sure you'll all enjoy it.
It goes something like this.
* You must remember this * * A kiss is just a kiss * * A sigh is just a sigh * Vicky, I-I can't believe you're moving to Chicago.
Danny, I've been thinking about this all day.
I'm gonna take that job here doing the weather.
Really?
That's great.
But wait a minute.
Vicky, what about Chicago?
That was your dream job.
But San Francisco has one thing Chicago doesn't.
Rice-A-Roni?
All right, two things.
Vicky, I-- I can't let you give up your dream for me.
If you stay here and you do the weather, you're gonna hate it.
And then pretty soon, you're gonna start to hate me.
I could never hate you.
I may resent you a little.
MAN : Final boarding for Flight 19 to Chicago.
Vicky, you've gotta get on that plane or you're gonna regret it.
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.
You're right.
Oh, Danny, I'm gonna miss you.
I'm gonna miss you too.
Goodbye, sweetheart.
MAN : Flight 217 to Reno, now available for preboarding.
I can't do it.
Vicky, you need to be strong.
No, I can't do it because I don't have luggage or a ticket.
You mean I have to go through this whole goodbye again tomorrow?
Yes, but we'll always have the terminal lounge.
* The world will always Welcome lovers * * As time goes by * Thank you.
Thank you very much.
We're gonna take a short break, but I bet ya won't even know we're gone.
MAN : Passenger Wilson, please pick up the white courtesy phone.
Passenger Wilson Well Hey, Jess, I really like the new band.
Thank you.
They really make you look, uhyoung.
Do me a favor and point me to the restroom.
Sure.
Jess, honey, is this really what you wanna do?
No, this is really what I have to do.
Sing "Glow Worm" in an airport lounge?
I'll admit it's not the coolest gig in the world, but it's still music.
And, heh, you gotta admit, Irv is one bad mama in his own right.
Jess, what about your music?
You can't give up on that.
I'm not givin' up on my music.
I'm still gonna work on my music.
And if I get lucky, you know, it'll be great, I'll get a shot.
But Right now, I gotta contribute to my family.
But you do contribute.
You're a great husband, you're a great father.
I'm talkin' about money.
Now, whether I make a million dollars or $1, I-I can't just let you go to work and-- And make all the money for this family.
I'm a man.
You know, maybe I'm old-fashioned, but that's who I am.
And that's who I love.
Sweetie, I'm really sorry if I hurt your feelings.
And if you think it's important to be a Diplomat, then I back you 100 percent.
Thank you.
What's important is the "tuneage" in this joint.
We gotta work on this playlist.
All right, Dips.
You guys, come on.
Now, I know deep, deep down inside ya there's gotta be some kind of wild rock 'n' roll maniac just dying to get out, huh?
All right, we'll fake it.
A little rock 'n' roll music in E. Shall we, fellas?
Here we go.
