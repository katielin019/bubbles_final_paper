{START OF EPISODE 1}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
Hi, Dr. Crane.
Hello, Woody.
Set me up, will you?
Coming right up.
Boy, you know, no matter how many times I come in here, I can't get over how silly you look in that ridiculous outfit.
Really?
I kind of like it.
People treat me with a little more respect.
And there's another bonus.
Saves me that couple extra hours I used to spend every morning picking out a shirt.
Yes, that can be very time consuming.
Whatever happened to the good old days?
Everything was better.
Sam still owned the bar.
He wasn't out circumnavigating the globe.
Yonder sat Diane with a book.
Norm and Cliff were permanent fixtures in this place.
God, how I miss those hail-fellows-well-met.
Where has it gone, Woody?
Oh, hey, come on, Dr. Crane.
It'll be all right.
: Will it?
"Oh, death in life, the days that are no more".
Who said that?
Who said what?
"Oh, death in life, the days that are no more".
You did.
No, no, you see, I mean who said it first?
Y-You said it both times.
You know, you're right, Woody.
Some things never change.
Especially the simple ones.
And don't you forget it.
Making your way in the world today Takes everything you've got Taking a break from all your worries Sure would help a lot Wouldn't you like to get away?
Sometimes you want to go Where everybody knows your name And they're always glad you came You want to be where you can see Our troubles are all the same You want to be where everybody knows your name You want to go where people know People are all the same You want to go where everybody knows your name.
Afternoon, everybody.
Norm!
Well, that was it, Woody.
Last chance; I'm out of here.
You caught them by surprise.
I'm telling you, they'll get it.
Woody, new crowd's a bunch of stiffs, okay?
They're never going to get it.
Hey, Woody.
Hey, Eddie.
: How you doing?
Good, how are you?
Good.
You know, I passed Norm Peterson on the stairs.
He didn't give me the time of day.
Oh, it's 3:15.
Thanks.
Well, would you like a drink, or did you just drop in for the time?
Now that you mentioned it.
Say, is, uh, Carla around?
She said she wanted to talk to me.
Said it was real important, eh?
She just went upstairs.
She'll be back down in a minute.
Good.
Well, we haven't seen you for a while, eh?
Yeah, you know, Carla and I kind of drifted apart.
I don't know, I haven't seen her in months.
The usual?
You bet, Woody.
Good memory.
Thanks.
What is your usual?
Uh, just give me a beer.
Coming right up.
Sam around?
Oh, didn't you hear?
No.
Sam sold the bar to some big corporation.
Bought a boat.
He's sailing around the world with it.
Hey, well, good for Sam.
Thought he was supposed to get married.
Well, Miss Chambers went off to write her book, only that didn't work out, and last we heard, she was out in Hollywood trying to write for TV.
I'll bet whatever she comes up with, it'll be pretty darn good.
I bet it will.
Oh, Eddie?
Hey, Carla.
What did you want to talk to me about?
Okay, see ya.
Yeah, see ya, Eddie.
So, Carla, what did Eddie say about his impending fatherhood?
He wants to think about it.
Mmm.
Well, my guess is he'll do exactly what I or any normal, red-blooded men would do in this situation.
On the other hand, you might actually hear from him again.
No, I'm joking, I'm joking.
Come on, am I the only cut-up left in this morgue?
Come on!
Remember the old days when things were fun?
Do you remember when the bar was brimming with scamps, and atop every barstool perched an irrepressible Merry-Andrew?
You remember that, Sam?
Oh, my God, Sam!
Sam!
Sam, you're back!
Ah, yeah, you bet I'm back.
Oh, look at Woody!
: Hey, man, how are you?
!
Good.
Whoo!
Look at this.
Hey, everybody.
Who are these people?
Things just aren't the same anymore, Sam.
Boy, yeah, I'll say.
Can't believe the number of changes around here.
Thank God you're still pregnant, huh?
: Yeah.
Who's the lucky guy?
Everybody but Eddie LeBec.
Eddie.
Yeah.
You thirsty?
I'll get you a seltzer.
Yeah, get me something to drink here.
Sam, what happened to your around-the-world sail?
Well, it kind of lost some of its appeal, Woody, after I sank.
Sank?
Where?
Somewhere in the Caribbean.
Well, you must feel terrible.
Well, no, not really.
You know, a lot of good came out of it.
I discovered a reef that nobody had ever heard of, and even named it after me.
"No Brains Atoll".
Maybe you two should start calling each other in the morning.
Sammy, it's part of the new regime.
They're running this joint like a military outfit.
Well, that's too bad.
Oh, no, look at that.
What happened to my photograph?
Never mind; now you're back, you can buy back the bar, things can be the way they were.
I don't have enough money to buy back an ice cube.
But anyway, you know, hey, I just want to work here.
If I can't be the boss, I can at least be the highest-paid employee.
Yeah, well, I don't know.
We got two bartenders already, Sam.
You're kidding.
Who?
Well, hold onto your sides.
I'm going to introduce you to Mr. Chucklepuss.
Hey, Wayne.
Sam this is Wayne; Wayne, Sam Malone.
How do you do?
Hello.
Sorry, Wayne, but Sam is going to take over your job.
Yeah, well, there's no reason why you can't hang around and be a relief bartender.
I'm hardly a relief bartender.
Yeah, that's right.
You know, uh, Wayne has bored the hell out of people in some of the finest bars and restaurants in Boston.
And as he'd be the first one to tell you, he can make any drink known to man.
Oh, is that right?
Try me.
Okay.
Um, a moonbeam.
With or without curaçao?
Serendipity, neat.
That only comes with ice.
Saddleback.
Onion or olive?
Both.
Stick 'em in your nostrils.
Well, that's all right.
What the hell, I'll just come at this from another angle.
Uh, who's, uh, who's running the show now?
Oh, no, no, I-I wouldn't approach it that way.
No, this new manager eats live sharks for breakfast.
Ah, but don't go by me.
I've hated every boss I've ever had.
How can you say that?
I was your boss.
Yeah, right.
Oh, I was; come on.
Anyway, I really hate her.
"Her"?
Whoa-- a woman?
Oh, is she married?
Who'd marry her?
An unmarried woman.
Might take me all of five minutes to get my job back.
Ha-ha-ha.
Why?
What?
Oh, no, what, is she one of those pasty-faced little business school graduates with thick glasses and her hair pulled back so tight she hears through her eyes-- one of those?
She's coming right now.
Why don't you be the judge of that?
Watch this.
I came up with a few new grabbers while I was out at sea.
Mm-boo-ah.
Miss Rebecca Howe, Sam Malone.
Sam, Rebecca Howe.
How do you do?
Ah-voo-ah.
And to you.
If you'll excuse me.
Boy, you know, she's almost as great-looking as I am.
Almost.
Gee, I wonder what she'll make me for breakfast?
Miss Tortelli, you have a couple of customers in the corner that look like they're on the verge of a good time.
You better hurry over there and put your usual stop to it.
Yes, ma'am.
Good afternoon, Miss Howe.
Hello, Woody.
I mean Wayne.
Did you lose your name tag again?
Yeah.
But I found my pants.
Keep up the good work, Woody.
Uh, excuse me.
Um, I want to apologize for my behavior back there.
I was led astray.
Somebody told me that you were kind of a schnauzer.
Uh-- Sam Malone.
Yes.
Yes.
You're the gentleman that used to own this bar.
Well, I heard you were sailing around the world.
Well, I was going to do that, but, uh, something kept pulling me back here, and I just couldn't figure out what it was, till now.
Which reminds me of the other thing I heard about you.
: Oh, no Wait, let me set the record straight here.
There have been a lot of ridiculous, unbelievable rumors about my sexual prowess.
I just want to tell you that most of them are right on the money.
You know, Mr. Malone, we've known each other only seconds, and I'm already tired of you.
Uh, w-w-wait a minute, wait a minute.
I know you think you've had just about enough excitement for one day, but there's more.
I'm back and I'm ready to jump behind the bar.
We're fully staffed, Mr. Malone.
Jump somewhere else.
Uh, well, hold on a second.
Can't we, uh, can't we discuss this?
We just did.
No, no, no, I meant someplace private where we could slip out of our things and say howdy.
I don't know if I find your come-ons disgusting or merely pathetic.
I do know you're giving me a headache behind the eyes.
It feels like a little insect boring into my brain.
Oh!
You didn't knock.
Habit.
Oh, my God.
Boy, this place doesn't even look like my office anymore.
Thank you; it wasn't easy.
How could you do this?
I mean, you-you took away all the all the charm, all the warmth.
Where's Dave?
"Dave"?
My moose head.
I set him free.
If he really loves you, he'll come back.
This is, uh, a lot of changes to absorb in such a short time here.
Would you just get out of here?
: Oh, hey, come on.
Lighten up.
Running a bar should be fun, you know?
No, visiting a bar should be fun.
Running a bar is hard work.
Mr. Malone, I have had a great deal of training and education to get to this point, and it's important to me that I succeed; that it succeed.
Well, in that case, you're missing a great opportunity here.
You see, having a sports celebrity in the bar is great for business.
I mean, you take a look at your, uh You take a look at your, uh, at your major places in Atlantic City.
They got your Willie Mays, your Mickey Mantle It seems a critical difference here is that I've heard of those people.
Oh, now Wait a second here.
You know, a lot of people may not know this, but I happen to be quite famous.
Well, I don't care if you're famous or not-- I don't need a bartender.
But you're perfectly welcome to come here as a patron anytime.
And I personally guarantee you'll be treated with every courtesy.
Unless you're waited on by Miss Tortelli.
Now, if you don't mind Wait-wait a second here.
Um I sold this bar because it had a lot of, uh, bad memories for me.
But once I got away from it, I realized that it had a lot of good memories, too.
Mr. Malone, I really Please, please listen.
I'm not enjoying this, either.
There was, uh, one memory in particular that I have been trying to shake.
See, I was, uh, I was afraid that I was gonna walk in here today, and, uh see her face everywhere I looked, but instead, what I saw was all these silly changes you made in here.
I happen to think it's No, no, I mean, it was good.
It helped me.
Look, what I'm trying to say is, uh, this place is the closest thing I have to a real home.
I want to come back.
Please.
I'm very sorry, Mr. Malone.
I wish that I could help.
I see.
Wait a minute.
I guess we could use another relief bartender a couple of nights a week.
Well, it's a start.
I appreciate that.
Don't mention it.
You've had some tough breaks.
Oh, not so bad really.
You lost the bar.
And now you tell me that's your home.
You lost your girlfriend.
And I guess you were some sort of an athlete who's having a lot of trouble getting over it.
Anyway, I just hope working here can help fill a little of the emptiness.
Yeah, well, I'm sure it will.
Thanks again.
You're not doing this out of pity, are you?
Pity?
Well, yeah.
I I can't take this job if it's just pity.
It's not just pity.
There are other things.
Oh.
Well, good.
Like what?
Like It's pity.
Just pity?
Just pity.
No respect?
No.
No personal value?
Do you like my shirt?
Actually, that's a great shirt.
Well, you know what they say.
Uh, pity and a nice shirt, and the world's your oyster, huh?
Well, uh, I got the job.
All right.
Wow!
Great.
Well, it's-it's only part time, you know.
I mean, you do have two bartenders.
Yeah, well, maybe not for long.
I've already launched "Operation Wayne Down the Dwain".
Our boys are in the air.
What do you mean?
Wha Cheers.
Mr. Malone, will you fill out this W-4 form and return it to me?
You bet.
Mr. Drake for you.
Give it to me.
No, wait a minute.
I'll get it in my office.
I locked myself out.
No, I didn't.
Well, so much for her dress shield.
Why?
Who-who's this, uh who's this Drake guy?
He's vice president of the corporation you sold out to, and she's got a third-degree case of the hots for him, and he doesn't know she's alive.
Yeah, I have my doubts myself.
Mm.
Hey, Carla, you used to, uh, listen in on my phone conversations.
Never.
I'm insulted.
Show me how to do it, will you?
Just press that third button, pick up the receiver.
Well, no, I have not sent that statement over yet, but I'll send it right away.
No, it's no problem, I love you.
I mean, I'd love to.
I'd love to.
Oh, by the way, I hired a new relief bartender.
Kind of a sad case, really.
Sam Malone.
Used to play for the Red Yes, that's him.
Well, of course I tried to get him full time.
Wonderful drawing card.
Yes, sir.
I'll sweeten the offer.
Of course.
Thank you.
Good-bye.
Rats.
Mr. Malone?
May I speak with you a moment?
Sure, what's up, Becky?
I've just been in there thinking.
Mm-hmm.
You know, maybe I'm cutting off the bar's association with sports too quickly.
Oh, I don't know, Becks, I think you were right in the first place.
Besides, I, uh, I don't think I could live on a relief bartender's salary.
Well, what if I made you full time?
I don't think I could survive on a full-time bartender's paycheck, either.
Does that, uh, include all the usual perks-- medical, dental, horizontal?
Mr. Malone, we can discuss the terms later.
The important thing is that you come back to work here.
Oh, I don't know.
: Please.
Since you're practically begging-- Ha!
-- yeah, I guess I could take the job.
Uh, you know, I'm gonna hate the see Wayne hit the streets.
Yes, I agree.
Woody, may I see you in my office, please?
You bet, Miss Howe.
No, no, wait, uh, no, not Woody.
Uh, what about Wayne?
I happen to think Wayne is a very talented bartender.
I don't think he's so great.
No, Ms. Tortelli?
No.
I bet there are a lot of drinks he doesn't know how to make.
Impossible.
I know every drink there is.
Oh, yeah?
I say that a customer is gonna come into this bar tonight and order a drink you've never heard of.
No way, never happen.
Well, if it does, will you take a hike?
All right.
And if I win?
Then you get Sam's sailboat.
Deal, Sam?
It's a deal.
You're on.
I love sailing.
Oh.
This looks like a nice, friendly tavern.
Heck, I'll give it a chance.
Norm!
Not now, you idiot.
Yes, sir.
Let's see.
What do I feel like today?
What am I in the mood for?
I guess a, uh, Screaming Viking'd do it.
Don't you, uh mean a Laughing Swede?
No.
What's the matter, Wayne?
You heard the man.
That drink does not exist.
There's been many a morning I wished to God it hadn't.
I've never heard of that drink, and no one else has, either.
This gentleman made it up.
Do I have to take my business else No, please, sir.
Excuse me, Miss Howe, I can make that.
You want the cucumber bruised?
Slightly.
Shall I get your coat, Wayne?
There is no such thing as a Screaming Viking.
I assure you, Miss Howe.
Screaming Viking over here, please.
I don't know what's going on here, but I've been a barten Bartender, make it two.
Coming right up.
Wait a minute!
There is no such drink as a Screaming Uh, I think I'll have a Screaming Viking.
Although, the, uh the name itself is a misnomer, since the Vikings were not actually the murderous plunder Would you shut up!
And welcome, stranger.
You know what I'm in the mood for?
Screaming Viking.
Screaming Viking!
Screaming Viking!
Yeah, Screaming Viking.
Screaming Viking!
Screaming Viking!
Miss Howe!
I'm sorry.
I gave it a shot.
But obviously, I am not liked by the customers or the employees.
Screaming Viking!
I haven't been called that since my honeymoon.
Mr. Malone?
May I see you in my office?
Yes, ma'am.
Whoo-hoo.
Here's to the best Screaming Viking in town.
Here you go.
What's this?
A severance check.
Please be a stranger.
Why?
Wha What did I do?
In baseball-ese, Mr. Malone, you showed me up.
You and the rest of the katzenjammer kids.
Good-bye.
Now, wait a minute.
What about that conversation you had with your, uh My what?
Your-your heart.
Your heart.
Y-You pity me.
You've spent your pity, Mr. Malone.
Okay, fine.
Yeah, you know, I don't want your pity, anyway.
You know, I can live without this job.
I'll find another way of supporting myself.
And my mother.
I mean, now that the doctor's only giving me six months to live.
Come on!
Please listen.
I swear to you, nothing like this'll ever happen again.
Come on, a decent boss would give me a second chance.
And I'll tell you something, I Don't say, "A guy would".
I wasn't gonna say, "A guy would".
But he would.
All right.
I'll give you another chance.
All right, thank you.
Thank you.
But I want to make something very clear.
Okay.
You've just got one chance left.
Mm-hmm.
And as far as I'm concerned-- again, in baseball-ese-- it's the bottom of the ninth, you've got two outs, two strikes, and no balls.
Okay, all right.
I'm still at the plate, though, right?
Right.
All right.
Now, I think Woody would probably appreciate a little help out there.
Yes, ma'am.
Can Can I ask you just one small favor?
What?
Can I see you smile?
Why?
You know, it'd just be a friendly gesture, to prove there are no hard feelings.
Oh, come on, I bet you're the kind of girl that lights up a room when she smiles.
That's stupid.
I'll give you a little help.
Watch this, watch this.
Hmm.
Gee, I was wrong.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
I hate this uniform.
It is ugly.
It makes me look like a beached whale.
And on top of everything I can't find any earrings to go with it.
Try some broccoli.
Ha-ha-ha!
I mean it, Sam.
I really hate it.
I used to like it, but now I'm getting kind of tired of it.
Feel like I'm wearing the same thing every day.
Listen, I'm not a big fan of them either but let's just give it our best here.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on, Sam No, no, don't Can't you just talk to the Iron Maiden?
Convince her to get rid of them.
Come on.
Oh Miss Howe, uh about the uniforms.
Oh, I'm glad you reminded me.
The dry cleaning plant is on strike.
Now, we may not have fresh uniforms for at least a week, so I want you to be extra careful with those.
Oops.
Oh, no.
Um you guys are going to get it.
Didn't you hear what Miss Howe just got through  I get it.
Yo  Making your way in the world today Takes everything you've got Taking a break from all your worries Sure would help a lot Wouldn't you like to get away?
Sometimes you want to go Where everybody knows your name And they're always glad you came You want to be where you can see Our troubles are all the same You want to be where everybody knows your name You want to go where people know People are all the same You want to go where everybody knows your name.
Hi, everybody.
Hey, Dave.
All right.
How are you?
I know who you are.
I've seen you on the news.
I can't believe it.
Hey, everybody.
It's Dave Richards, Channel 10.
Channel 13.
Oh, sorry.
Never mind.
Sam, I got a proposition for you.
No, no, no if she's not good enough for you, I sure don't want her.
No, no, it's nothing like that.
You see, I have to give up my TV spot, I on Sports.
They're looking for a fill-in for the week and I thought you might be interested.
Boy, sports on TV I've never really considered that.
: Think I'd be any good at it?
Who knows?
It may turn out to be a permanent gig for you.
That's how I got my start.
Whoo, boy, I don't know.
Oh, come on, Sam.
Come on.
Every time we watch Dave, you say, "I can do better than that stump".
Thank you, Carla.
You're too kind.
Come on, Sam.
You'd be great.
You talk good like me and you're handsome.
Of course, Sam.
What do you say?
Listen if I were you, okay-- and believe me, not a day goes by I don't wish I were-- I would take this job.
Sam, look It's a lot of fun.
You see, you get to sit behind this desk.
You don't have to wear pants.
It's my little joke on the audience.
I do know sports, and I'm articulate at that.
Hey, you know something?
I'm going to do it.
All right!
Congratulations.
Thanks, man.
You're on at 11:00.
Wait a minute.
Tonight?
Without any preparation or anything?
Sure, I do it all the time.
Look, I want you to get down to Wardrobe ASAP, huh?
All right.
See ya.
Wait, wait, wait.
Whoa, man.
Who do I talk to over there?
A very good friend of mine, Phil somebody or another.
I forget.
Anyway, I got to get going, meet my lady.
She's terrific.
Huh?
This time the Dave Machine is finally settling down.
Well, hey, congratulations, man.
Excuse me.
The alarm just went off.
I make an ungodly amount of money and I know exactly how to use it.
You must be a friend of Mr. Malone's.
Well, you know what they say, "The good-looking ones travel in pairs".
And, uh, that's certainly true in your case.
Do you have the time?
Good, 'cause I just wanted to remember the exact moment I met the biggest jerk on Earth.
Tough woman, tough woman.
You got that right.
I wear a cup to work.
Well, the pulsating Dave Machine's history.
All right, man, take care.
Excuse me, Dave.
Dr. Crane here.
If you're interested, I happen to conduct a little session for narcissists about once a month.
My policy: only show up if I get an award.
This is the Big Dave Machine saying good night and may the sports be with you.
You know, I bet if you held your ear up to his, you could hear the ocean.
I'll have to try it sometime.
It, uh, may not work for you.
Hey, guys, I'm off to the station.
Listen, do me a favor, will ya?
Woody, Carla, close up for me.
You know Whoa, Sammy, you're forgetting something a little important here.
What?
You don't own this joint anymore.
Oh, boy.
And even if you did, Field Marshal Howe wouldn't give you the night off.
Yeah, yeah.
Silly me.
What am I going to do about this, huh?
Sam, may I suggest deception?
Well Hold on your horses there, Frasier.
As a psychiatrist, isn't it your job to seek and uphold the truth?
Oh, get real, Cliff.
You know, you got a good idea there, Frasier.
Yeah.
Lying.
I do lying.
Woody, come here.
Do me a favor.
When Miss Howe comes out of the office here, go down the hall and call the bar.
I'll answer.
What do I say?
Nothing.
Just stand there and hold the phone.
Okay, I'll give it a try.
Um, Miss Howe, we're running low on napkins.
So order more.
I don't know how many more.
I don't run the bar anymore.
Thank you.
I appreciate this very much.
I'll get it.
I'll get it.
Cheers.
Yeah, this is Sam Malone.
What?
You say my apartment's been robbed?
Oh, Sammy!
You say I've been cleaned out?
Well, damn.
Yeah, I guess I could get over there right away and maybe expect not to be back here for a few hours, huh?
Well, thank you very much.
Thank you.
That was my landlord.
Do you believe this?
I've been robbed.
What's happening to this city?
Go on, Sammy.
ALL : Go, Sammy!
Go, Sammy!
Go, Sammy, go!
We're a, uh, victim support group.
I see.
Well, I better hire a relief bartender.
Hello?
Is there somebody on this phone?
Oh, uh, hi, Miss Howe.
It's-it's me, Woody.
Woody, are you using this phone?
No, no, not really.
What are you doing, Woody?
Oh, I'm just standing here holding it.
Woody, hang up the phone, please.
I have to hire another bartender now.
Oh, no, Miss Howe, I'm really sorry.
I swear I'll never do it again.
And Keller is scheduled to be executed on Friday.
I guess he won't be around then for the Patriots-Buffalo game this Sunday.
For that and all the sports, a new member to the Channel 13 team, here's former Red Sox pitcher Sam Malone.
Nice to have you with us, Sam.
Thank you, Joanne.
I'd just like to say that you look better live than you do in person.
Thank you.
Oh, very slick.
Very slick indeed.
Yes.
Five bucks says Sammy has Joanne at 11:00.
Red Sox pitcher Paul Willis went on the 15-day disabled list today.
Willis has floating cartilage in his knee and tomorrow will undergo arthroscopic surgery.
All right!
I can't bel On his first night!
Club soda, Woody, please.
Sure, Miss Howe.
Today on This Old House, we're going to be grouting counter tile, so I'm sure you'll want to stick around for that.
But first, let's go in the kitchen.
Don't you guys usually watch sports?
Yeah, well, yeah, usually, but, uh, they're going to be putting up drywall in a minute.
The subflooring is just being laid.
And now for the I on Sports commentary.
You know, the world is full of negative people.
Okay, so the Sox aren't having such a great season, but that's no reason to boo and say bad things about them.
You know, I don't know where I heard it, but I thought you were supposed to root, root, root for the home team.
So the next time you're in Fenway, you can't yell something nice, don't yell anything at all.
This has been just one guy's opinion.
Joanne?
Thank you, Sam.
You've given us all a lot to think about.
We'll be right back with the weather after this message.
And we're clear.
That was quite a commentary, Sam.
Well, I hope I didn't offend anyone, you know?
I just feel like it had to be said.
Mm.
Would you mind a little friendly critique?
No, no.
Go ahead.
I know this is the first time you've done this, but I think you might want your commentaries to be a little more Oh, what's the word I'm searching for?
Interesting.
Interesting.
Right.
You know, that gives me something to shoot for there.
Say, uh, there's a late-breaking story over at my place around 12:00-ish.
Care to cover it?
Sorry, I don't do fluff pieces.
And in five, four, three, two Well, it was a little chilly coming into work today.
Dr. Buzz, what does our weather look like?
Not to waste any of the grout.
Remember, it's nine cents a ton This looks really fascinating.
Oh, I'll say.
Gee, you should've seen this guy put the flasher on the roof.
I'm so sorry I missed that.
I was watching Sam do the sports on Channel 13.
Sammy!
Our I on Sports!
How was I?
You were great, Sam.
Hey, I never found the scores so fascinating.
Yeah, it was pure Musburger, Sammy.
Sammy, it was the single greatest exhibition of sportscasting I've ever seen in my life.
And I am not just saying that in order to get a free beer.
If the spirit does move you, Sammy, I take a size 12 sudsy.
Hey, thank you, guys.
You know, coming from you, it means a lot.
So, Carla how was I really?
It was like watching old people eat.
You delivered the sports fine, but you got to jazz up the commentary.
Yeah, yeah, boy, they said that same thing down at the station.
You know, you got to talk about something a little more interesting than rooting for the home team.
That's like saying, "let's all drive safely".
There goes tomorrow's commentary.
You know, I want to do so great at this job, but it's kind of tough, you know?
I got to come up with five opinions a week.
Well, they couldn't pay me enough.
You know, I'll worry about this later.
Right now I got to get Rebecca to give me the rest of my nights off.
No problem there, Sammy.
I don't think you work here anymore.
What are you talking about?
Vampira knows.
She was watching TV in her office.
She has a TV in there?
Yeah, one of those little tiny ones, like her heart.
Great.
Uh, Ms. Howe?
I have a confession to make.
You know that story about my apartment being robbed?
I made that all up.
No!
Yeah, yeah.
Actually, I was down at Channel 13 doing the sportscast.
Hope you're not mad.
Well, you used to be the boss.
How did you feel when people lied to you?
Ah, well, I had a rule.
When anyone ever lied to me, they had to go to bed with me.
Well, that's one way to make sure it won't happen again.
You know, Mr. Malone, you haven't been dealing fairly with me.
I know, I know.
I'm sorry.
It's just that this this means a lot to me.
And now I suppose you're going to ask me for the rest of the week off.
Yeah, I know, it's a lot to ask.
No, it isn't.
You're on.
Oh, great.
What, am I fired or something?
Not at all.
Look, I figure one of two things will happen: either you'll do well, they'll offer you a job and I'll never see you again; or you'll screw up, humiliate yourself and come back here a crushed and broken man.
Either way, I win.
Son of a gun, you do have heart.
Of course I do.
Tell me though.
What'd you think?
How'd I look out there?
I've never seen you look better.
Really?
You should always be this size.
Let me give you some advice here: never do this to a guy.
Guys, guys, he's about to do the commentary here.
Anybody know what the topic's going to be?
Well, no, no, he said he was going to crank it up by taking a firm stand.
Hey, Woody, wasn't he rehearsing with you?
Yeah, but he made me promise not to tell you guys.
It's too exciting.
And I don't remember.
Tonight I'm going to tackle the issue that's tearing professional sports apart-- natural grass or artificial turf?
Now this reporter's not afraid to say that he's firmly in favor of natural grass.
It's softer, causes fewer injuries, and let's face it, folks: it looks prettier on TV.
That's just one guy's opinion.
Joanne?
Gee, Sam, I heard somewhere that in an indoor stadium it's impossible to grow real grass.
Well, yes, yes, uh in indoor stadiums, you have to use the fake stuff.
And I've heard that some of the more recent synthetic blends actually do help reduce injuries.
Oh.
Well, I hadn't heard that, Doc.
That's pretty amazing.
So what are you saying here, Sam?
Well, I guess I'm saying that I could go either way on it.
So you have no opinion on this?
No, I have two opinions.
And that's one guy's opinions.
SAM : The Graf-Everett final may be a good match-up, but if you ask this I on Sports, the fact that Martina Navratilova decided to sit this one out Ooh, to say "Martina Navra- whoever" without even You know, I got a phone call today from a teenager saying I was taking advantage of my status as an ex-ballplayer and that old squares like me shouldn't be doing the sports.
Well, Corky, tonight's commentary is directed right at you.
Time to rap about a controversy Gonna take a stand, won't show no mercy A lot of folks say jocks shouldn't be Doing the sports news on TV I don't want to hear the latest scores From a bunch of old broadcasting school bores So get your scores from a guy like me Who knows what it's like to have a groin injury G-G-Groin, g-g-groin G-G-Groin injury.
Joanne.
Dr. Buzz, there must be some weather.
Ah, poor Sammy.
Bet you they fired him after that display, huh?
Yeah, I guess he won't be showing his face around here tonight.
Would you come into a place where everyone thought you were a complete idiot?
Never mind.
Well, I suppose he's out wandering the streets, rapping incoherently.
Yeah, yeah, but what if he comes in?
What are we going to say to him?
Well, just tell him he was brave.
Yeah, like a kamikaze pilot.
Wow, I always wanted to meet one of those guys.
The stories they must tell, huh?
Well, I guess as per usual, it's up to me as his best friend to tell him the truth.
You?
I'm sure he'll understand if I tell him.
Hey, nobody is tighter with Sammy than me.
I'm the one who should tell him he stinks.
So what'd you think of my commentary tonight?
I thought you were wonderful.
It just felt great up there.
I tell you, ever since I sold the bar I've been floundering.
It's like I'm standing in quicksand.
You know, I've been trying to get my feet planted on the ground and all of a sudden, it's all come together.
It's like everything I've ever done in my life has been leading up to this moment.
My knowledge of sports, my good looks, my ability to rhyme.
You know, I tell you, I think I found my niche in life.
They liked you down at the station?
Are you kidding, liked me?
Man, they were speechless.
Oh, hey, yeah, Rebecca.
Listen, uh, did you catch my act tonight?
Yes, I did.
So what'd you think?
Now you can be honest with me.
Honest?
Mm-hmm.
Let's see as news rappers go, I thought you were fine.
But maybe rapping has just been kind of done to death.
Oh, no, you think so?
I mean, I'd hate to think I looked stupid out there.
No, no, not at all.
No, no, no, it's just that it's not unique anymore, Sam.
I mean, uh, you know, it'd be one thing if you were the first guy to rap, but they're rapping on stations all over town.
You don't want to be the last on a long train of rappers.
Yeah, Norm is right there, Sammy.
I mean, you got to do something different.
Do something revolutionary, something that no sportscaster does anymore.
You know, like, uh read the sports.
You know, I have been working on something, but I was afraid it was too much.
But if you guys think that rapping's old hat you know, I just may give it a shot.
I'm going to work on it right now, as a matter of fact.
Suppose we ought to stop him?
Oh, no, wait a minute.
How do we know it's going to be another bad idea?
I mean, it couldn't be as bad as tonight, could it?
: Hi, everybody.
: Hi, Little Sam.
Are you ready for tonight's Oh, my God.
LITTLE  I sure am.
I think the Red Sox are making a big mistake trading away young players for veterans who can only help them for a season or two.
Don't you agree, Little Sam?
No, I think you're full of hooey.
If I paid five bucks to get in the ballpark, I want to see them win now.
What do you know?
Your head's wooden.
Well, your lips are moving.
If either of them mentions the bar, I'm suing.
Stop it.
Well, that's two guys' opinions.
Joanne?
Oh, boy.
It seemed like such a good idea at the time.
Boy, I wanted that job so bad.
I wanted to make it work.
I guess I just went over the edge, huh?
Hey, make him talk, Sam.
Make him say my name.
Maybe later, Woody.
My lips are kind of tired right now.
I know things seem a little bleak right now, but, um, I think there's two important things to look at here.
One: at least you took a chance.
And two-- and this is the important one-- you know when to quit.
Yeah, boy, that's true.
You know, I came real close to losing my dignity tonight.
I've been thinking about it, you know, I'm going to hang up the old Channel 13 blazer.
You know, if that phone were to ring right now and they were to beg me to come back, I wouldn't do it.
I think it's just time that I grew up and accepted what I am: a bartender.
And a damned good one at that, too.
Cheers.
It's the station.
Well, you're kidding me.
The switchboard's lighting up?
Well, look, hey.
Listen, I'm sorry, I don't care if they loved me.
I happen to have a job already and I have friends and I have my dignity.
Yeah.
Well, thanks anyway.
Yeah, bye-bye.
Very admirable, Mr. Malone.
Well, I still have a little nobility left.
All right.
Okay, Sam.
Oh, I have to cancel that relief bartender.
Oh, maybe you ought to, uh Hello?
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
Well, that cute little dimple?
Well, I think I still got it.
It's kind of hard for me to see back there.
Um, Renee, I'm going to have to get back to you.
Yeah, bye-bye.
Uh, Linda, sweetheart, uh, can we continue this over lunch?
Well, um, your place.
Don't cook.
Let me guess-- personal call?
Very.
Malone, I find winking really smarmy.
Yeah, but beneath this smarm is a lot of charm, and I think you know that.
I know this I want you out of my office now.
All right, all right.
I'm sorry.
I know I'm not supposed to get personal calls here, but what the hey, you know; super-strength Sammy has been off the shelves now for over a year-- there's a lot of pent-up demand out there.
What can I say?
Say, "I'd better get back to work.
I don't want to get fired".
You're cute when you're humorless.
Did you know that?
Cheers.
No, Simone, I'm sorry.
Sam's working.
: Simone?
Wait, wait, wait.
Try him later at home.
Well, then, perhaps on your next visit to the States.
Simone?
Man, you just cost me a roll in the hay.
I owe you one.
You're on.
I didn't mean that.
Wait a minute.
I think we need to get something  Making your way in the world today Takes everything you've got Taking a break from all your worries Sure would help a lot Wouldn't you like to get away?
Sometimes you want to go Where everybody knows your name And they're always glad you came You want to be where you can see Our troubles are all the same You want to be where everybody knows your name You want to go where people know People are all the same You want to go where everybody knows your name.
Geez listen to this.
"Scientists discover wild parrot who claims to be Elvis".
So?
"So"?
I mean, this one wins the "Too stupid for even you, Cliff" award.
Now, really, must you two wallow in this sensationalistic tripe?
It pains me no end to see America's wits dulled and their morals abrogated by this opiate of the asses.
Well, let's check this out, Cliffie.
"I was Sigmund Freud's love child".
No!
I've heard rumors that he betrayed Martha with his sister-in-law, but I never dreamed there were progeny.
You rapscallions.
What are you whistling about, huh?
You haven't got a dime to your name.
You're working for a woman who's a meat grinder, and you look like a baboon in that uniform.
Boy, life really stinks.
You okay?
I feel like puke.
Well, you're wearing the right uniform.
Want to talk about it?
No, what's there to say about a no-good, ice-eating little geek like Eddie LeBec.
He's known since a week ago that I got his bun in my oven, and what the hell has he done about it?
Jack Diddley.
Don't look now, but your ice-eating geek just walked in.
Don't you just love him?
Hi, Carla.
Hi, Eddie.
You, uh, busy?
Just a minute.
Uh, look, would you just write down what you want, and hand it to Howdy Doody over there?
I'm all yours.
Okay.
So, what's new?
Well, I, uh, I've had a lot on my mind lately.
Yeah?
You know, training camp's really been rough and a lot of competition at goalie, and really having to work my tail off to keep up, eh?
Sounds rough.
Yeah.
Say, you know, uh, since I'm already here, there's something I've been wanting to ask you.
Yeah?
It's a question.
I like questions.
Okay, but, see, this is the kind of question a guy really doesn't want to ask if he thinks he might get "no" for answer.
Well, it's kind of hard for a girl to give an answer until she knows what the question is.
Okay, but, you see, it would be a lot easier for a guy if he had some sort of sign Ask me, you little frog!
Okay.
Carla, would you?
Yes!
Yes!
Oh, oh, oh.
Eddie, yes.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Carla, do you mind if we, you know, we keep this quiet?
You know me, I don't like a lot of hoopla.
Oh, yeah, sorry.
Would it be okay if I just told Sam?
I guess.
Hey, Sammy!
Me and Eddie are getting married!
Oh, my God.
Hey, hey, hey.
Get over here, Eddie!
What's going on?
Oh, great news, Miss Howe.
Carla's marrying Eddie LeBec.
Oh, that cute little guy with the dents in his nose.
Hey, listen up, everybody.
Wait, wait, wait, here we go.
Here we go, here we go.
I want to be making a toast to my beautiful bride-to-be.
Listen, you know, I don't make my living using words, so this is gonna be kind of hard for me, okay, but here it goes.
Uh, Carla Well, you know.
Well, you know.
Yeah.
I love you, sweetie.
Hey, congratulations, man.
This is terrific.
Thanks.
Are you gonna take her on a honeymoon?
Hey, got any suggestions?
Yeah.
New Orleans.
I found a great little honeymoon spot just kind of tucked away off Bourbon Street.
Great food, very romantic, steamy atmosphere, you know.
Yeah, I had the time of my life, and then Vera tracked me down.
Well, if I get any time off from training camp, I thought maybe Carla might like to see Waikiki.
Waikiki Honolulu, Hawaii?
Sure, we'll hit them all.
Yeah, right!
I only hope I can get some time off from the Howitzer.
Sorry.
Miss Howitzer.
Time off?
Well, you'll be having all the time in the world.
You think I'd be having a wife of mine work in a crummy bar like this?
No offense, Miss Howitzer.
It's Miss Howe.
Oh, take it easy.
They're just complimenting your big guns.
Wait a minute.
Y-You're telling me that I don't have to work anymore?
You mean, I can just sit around the house all day, eating peanut butter out of a jar, and watching my toenails grow?
She's, uh, quite a catch, Ed.
Boy, you know, I'm gonna miss you around here.
Oh, Sammy, I'll drop by once in a while to watch all you 9-to-5'ers spill drinks on your butler suits.
So, when's the big day, Carla?
Well, I'd like to do it as soon as possible before my little hunk of back bacon here changes his mind.
Ah, no way, I'm not one of those flakes you used to go out with.
Oh, but listen, we have to get married on a day with a two in it 'cause two's my lucky number.
Rats.
Mine's three.
Oh, no sweat.
Lucky two, lucky three We can get married on the 23rd or the 32nd.
That's right, honey.
Oh, right, right.
No, um As long as it's not on a Wednesday.
Ooh, yeah, bad juju.
Yeah.
This is going to be an interesting wedding-- the two most superstitious people in the world.
Hey, hey, don't say that, it's bad luck.
Listen, whatever you do, don't make any plans afterwards 'cause we're going to throw you the biggest wedding reception in history right here Oh, great!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Force of habit.
Not my place to do that.
I'm sorry.
Ms. Howe's going to throw you the biggest wedding reception  I need to talk to you right now.
Uh, wait before you say anything, let me just, uh I had an idea.
Why don't you invite your boss, what's-his-name, Evan Drake.
You know, he's a sports fan, so I hear.
Maybe he'd enjoy meeting Eddie LeBec there.
You know, you could throw him a big bash, impress the pants off him.
What were you going to say?
I was going to tell you to smile more.
Mm-hmm.
I didn't say smugly.
Excuse me, I have a phone call to make.
Hey there, Eduardo, looks like you and Carla aren't the only lovebirds in town.
Check out DeeDee and David there.
Who?
DeeDee and David Lefsowski, the Weekly Gabbers' odd couple of the month.
See, she weighs in there at 480 pounds, and he tips the scales at a mere, uh, 92.
But I mean, just look at the love in his eyes.
I think that's fear, Cliff.
Cute baby he's holding.
That's her arm, Woody.
Cute arm he's holding.
Hey.
Picked a date yet?
Yep.
Eddie wants to do it a week from Saturday, anytime before 4:00 p.m. which is okay with my psychic, as long as our auras remain in the blue spectrum, and there's no solar eclipse.
It's really tough planning a wedding, isn't it?
Ooh, tell me about it.
You know, I'm just a little nervous about waiting eight days.
Gives Eddie an awful long time to come to his senses.
Look at him.
He's absorbed in thought over there.
Well, maybe not.
There.
The table looks nice.
Woody, don't you think the table looks nice?
I think it looks nice.
Looks nice.
You think so?
Oh, damn, I bet chucklebrain forgot to pick up the napkins.
Oh, no, Sam didn't forget.
Eddie brought these special wedding ones they had made up.
"We don't want to get married.
We have to.
Ha, ha".
Cute.
You see the little hillbilly with the shotgun?
Yes, he's nice, isn't he?
But I think these are just a little too funny for the reception.
Burn them.
Did you remember to get the cinnamon almond decaf?
Yeah, I did.
Who likes that?
Evan does.
Everyone does.
Excuse me, Miss Howe, I know it's none of my beeswax, but it seems to me like you're awfully nervous about Mr. Drake coming by today.
Do you like him or something?
In a business sense, yes.
I admire his skills and accomplishments.
You like him.
Boys we're all set up with my buddy Bruce.
He can get us the same silverware Carla picked out from the Filene's catalog for over two-thirds off.
Oh, yeah.
So what's the bite-ski?
I'll catch you guys later.
Say, Norm, there isn't any chance that this stuff is stolen merchandise, is there?
No, of course not.
Listen, if anyone asks, we never heard of Bruce, we can't find the receipt, and if you run into me up on the street, call me Larry.
My mind's at ease.
So, Sam, what are you concocting there?
You know how superstitious Carla and Eddie are.
I thought I'd mix them up a batch of my good-luck wedding punch.
It never fails.
Isn't that the same stuff you made when you were getting married to Miss Chambers?
Woody, you want to flush this down the toilet.
Hi, guys.
Hey.
Hey.
Carla, what are you doing here on your wedding day?
Oh, oh, actually I came by to get my last paycheck.
See, the bridal shop has this policy about their wedding gowns-- "Fork over the jack, or it stays on the rack".
So where is it?
Oh, I'm so sorry that I don't have it ready for you right this very second.
I guess I've just been busy putting up every single decoration and ordering all the hors d'oeuvres and getting a band together at the very last minute so that your reception could be just perfect for you.
Could you step on it?
I'm in a hurry.
Soda, bartender.
Coming right up.
So how's the bride on her big day?
Couldn't be better, Sammy.
All celestial omens are favorable.
Seems that Eddie and I picked the one day this century when all the planets and constellations are in perfect alignment.
So either we get married by 4:00 today, or we wait until the year 2042.
I don't know, call me old-fashioned, but I still think you ought to get married before your baby does.
How'd you manage to swing a church wedding?
You know, being divorced and all.
Don't you remember?
I had my marriage to Nick annulled years ago.
Oh, right, right, right, right.
Took forever.
Mm-hmm.
But things got speeded up when Nick tried to sell the Bishop his watch.
Oh, hey, isn't that Eddie LeBec sashaying down those stairs, there, Doc?
Sure looks like it.
But Carla's here.
Isn't there some superstition about the groom seeing the bride before the wedding?
Nobody believes in that anymore.
You saw me.
I saw you.
I saw you see me.
I saw you see me see you.
Oh Shut up.
You're making it worse.
Oh, my God.
We were so careful about every single thing, and then we blew the single most important superstition of all-- seeing the bride on the day of the wedding.
What are you doing here?
I was meeting my mother.
What are you doing here?
I came by to get my check!
That's it.
We've blown it.
We can't get married now.
Call me in 2042.
Yeah, okay.
I'll see ya.
You guys are kidding.
Come on.
Eddie.
Wait a minute.
What am I doing?
Carla Look, I don't want to give up the best thing that ever happened to me.
Oh, come off it, Eddie.
You're just as superstitious as I am.
Well, not anymore.
And I'm going to prove to you there's nothing to all that mumbo jumbo.
Woody, hand me a mirror.
Huh?
You know, the one Sam's always looking at himself in.
What are you going to do?
I'm going to break it.
The bad luck is starting already.
He's lost his mind.
Hey, that's my mirror.
You see?
Nothing.
The ground didn't open up and swallow me.
That's because they want you out in the open where lightning can get you.
Don't do that!
Oh!
Which shoulder do you throw salt over to avoid bad luck?
The left, the left.
No!
No, no!
Forgive him, demons of Hell.
He's a hockey player.
Don't, don't answer it.
Don't, don't Cheers.
Thanks, Woody.
Carla, it's for you.
Go on.
Go on, answer it.
Would you take it.
Come on.
Hello.
Oh, hi, Dr. Nadelson.
How did my tests come out?
You've got to be kidding.
What?
What is it?
Twins.
He spills the salt, he breaks the mirror, and I'm the one having twins.
I told you something horrible was going to happen.
What is so bad?
Twins means we're twice blessed.
Yeah, I had twins once.
It was the happiest day of my life.
Lighten up.
Lighten up.
Carla Carla, this is great.
Eddie You're really happy about this?
I'm the happiest man on Earth.
Listen, Carla, you and me, we can we can overcome any obstacles that are in our way.
You're a great guy, Eddie.
Dumb as a skate blade, but a great guy.
Ma!
Oh, my baby's home!
You see?
I knew things would look up.
What's wrong?
Ma, nothing.
Everything's aces.
It's just that, hey, when you called about getting remarried, I realized how much I love you.
I just wanted to be with you on this day.
And?
Uh, and Dad's TV shop-- it went under.
We got evicted, and I can't get unemployment 'cause Daddy didn't declare me an employee.
Well, I'm just glad my little boy's here for my wedding.
What about his lovely wife?
I'm just glad my little boy's here for my wedding.
Actually, Mother Tortelli, we didn't want to return to Vegas.
We don't think it's any place for children to grow up.
You're having a kid?
I'm talking about us.
So, if we could find someone here in Boston with an nice house and lots of extra room Do you know anyone like that, Mother Tortelli?
No, no, no.
You don't want to come live in my little, tiny, overcrowded house.
Ma, it's just temporary.
Just till I get back on my feet.
Hey, if it's a problem, we'll find someplace else to stay.
Yeah.
I think I saw a nice cardboard box in the alley.
See, see?
What did I tell ya?
This is the bad luck I've been warning you about.
Carla, don't worry about it.
I mean, the more the merrier.
Look, I'm going to get a major salary bump this season, and then I'll buy us all the biggest house in Boston.
Wow.
A new house?
You bet.
Now do you finally believe that nothing bad is going to happen?
No.
I'll just have more closet space when it does.
Anthony, I'm Eddie LeBec.
I guess I'm your new stepfather.
I'm hoping one day you'll call me "Dad".
Hey, Nick Tortelli is my dad.
You are not my father, and you never will be!
Anthony!
You only knocked up my ma so she'd have to marry you.
Ma, I'm sorry.
The guy was asking for it.
Come on, Annie, let's go.
Forgive him.
He has the hot passion of his race, and I have the envy of every woman I know.
Well, this is it.
This is the bad luck.
I mean, what could be worse than my kid hating my husband?
Look, it's okay.
He's just a kid.
Oh, you don't get it, Eddie.
He's the nicest one I got.
Look, Carla, he's just being protective of his mother.
God knows that I think my maman's the greatest woman on Earth.
And I can only hope that our kids feel the same way.
Are you from this planet?
Carla, here's your final paycheck.
Thank I might say that you have been a unique employee, and it's going to be very difficult to fill your uniform.
Thanks.
You don't happen to know any other short, pregnant cocktail waitresses, do you?
Yeah, can I help you?
Eddie LeBec.
Maman?
!
Tu es merveilleuse!
Je ne peux plus attendre pour que tu rencontre Carla.
Là voil, au bar.
Carla Carla.
Carla.
Non, Maman Maman Eddie, c'est qu'elle est belle.
Non, non, Maman.
C'est Carla.
Carla!
Non, non, Maman.
No, no, no, no.
Me Rebecca.
Her Carla.
Enjoy.
Carla.
I'm so happy to meet you.
Non.
Non.
Je ne permettrai jamais mon fils à marier ce petit souris avec le grand ventre.
Maman Maman Je ne permettrai ce mariage noon, avec le Maman.
O, mon Dieu!
She says she has to catch a bus.
Maman!
I get the feeling she wasn't nuts about me.
What'd she say?
What makes you think I'd know?
'Cause all you pompous windbags speak French.
She said she'll never allow this marriage.
Especially to a pregnant hussy who's only trying to trap her son.
Then she said she'd rather be dragged around town by her tongue or else she called you a small grapefruit.
Eddie, Eddie, Eddie, Eddie, wait a minute.
Before you say anything, I know what your mother said.
And it doesn't matter to me.
You finally convinced me that our love can conquer any bad luck that comes our way.
I mean it.
Anthony and Annie moving in, your ma hating me, Anthony hating you, twins Every time one of these little piddling things came up, I kept thinking you were going to say the wedding's off.
The wedding's off.
Yeah, that's what I kept expecting you to say.
The wedding's off.
Yeah, yeah, we're all clear on what I thought you'd say.
The wedding's off.
But you never said it.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Last time on Cheers: Hey, Sam, me and Eddie are getting married!
She's, uh, quite a catch, Ed.
Seems that Eddie and I picked the one day of the century when all the planets and constellations are in perfect alignment.
So we either get married by 4:00 p.m. today, or we wait until the year 2042.
This is going to be an interesting wedding, the two most superstitious people in the world.
Hey, hey, don't say that.
It's bad luck.
Our love can conquer any bad luck that comes our way.
Hey, that's my mirror.
I mean it, Anthony and Annie moving in You don't want to come and live in my little, tiny overcrowded house.
Your ma hating me I'm so happy to meet you.
Car-la.
Anthony hating you You are not my father and you never will be.
Twins I had twins once.
It was the happiest day of my life.
Every time one of these little, piddly things came up, I kept thinking you were going to say the wedding's off.
The wedding's off.
Afternoon, everybody.
Norm!
Hey, Mr. Peterson, would you like a beer?
No, I'd like a dead cat in a glass.
Men, you are looking at one sharp bargainer.
Not only did I get Carla and Eddie eight sterling-silver place settings, but I also got Bruce to throw in matching weenie tongs and lemon zester.
That's great, man, except the wedding's been called off.
Ah So what happened?
Eddie freaked out about being a father?
No.
Eddie's mom met Carla.
Hate at first sight.
Yeah, how'd you know?
Well, that's the "law" part of "mother-in-law," see.
So Eddie's not going to marry Carla because his mother doesn't approve.
I tell you, it's pathetic to see a grown man so tied to his ma's apron strings.
Well, that reminds me, Mr. Clavin, you mother called and said she couldn't make it for dinner tonight.
Oh, great.
What am I supposed to do with that casserole-- just throw it away?
Making your way in the world today Takes everything you've got Taking a break from all your worries Sure would help a lot Wouldn't you like to get away?
Sometimes you want to go Where everybody knows your name And they're always glad you came You want to be where you can see Our troubles are all the same You want to be where everybody knows your name You want to go where people know People are all the same You want to go where everybody knows your name.
Mr. Malone, remember that reception you talked me into?
Well, it seems that the bride is in my office and she's having a little problem with the groom.
She wants him to die with festering boils.
It's just the usual prenuptial jitters.
It'll be all right.
It will not be all right.
I invited my boss, and he's really excited about this.
Now, if Mr. Drake shows up here expecting a reception and there isn't a reception, I'm gonna have egg all over my face.
Actually, uh, you know, most complexion experts swear by the old egg facial.
It tightens one's pores.
Although yours look pretty tight to me.
I want to talk to you a minute.
Miss Howe, I think I can get this wedding back on track.
Thank God.
Yeah, but I have one little condition.
You pull this off and you can have anything you want.
Really?
Except that.
Actually, all I want to do is get rid of these stupid uniforms.
Mr. Malone, ever since you have worked here, you have done nothing but whine about these uniforms.
Now, I put a great deal of thought into them and I happen to think they make a statement.
Oh, yeah.
They say I'm a lima bean.
All right.
Fine, fine.
If you insist on keeping these uniforms, then there'll be no wedding, no wedding reception, and you and Mr. Drake can spend an intimate evening watching 40 quarts of guacamole turn black.
Fine, fine.
Get rid of the uniforms.
Okay.
Woody.
Yo.
Get on the phone.
Tell the church we're running a little bit late.
Cliff, see if you can catch up with Eddie there.
You betcha.
Norm, stay in the office and make sure Carla does not trash it.
Yes, you.
Frasier.
Go pick up Carla's gown, will you?
Right.
Oh, say, if anybody needs me, Just tell them I'm at Gown-O-Rama, tra-la.
That was all well and good.
Thank you.
How do you plan on getting the bride and groom back together?
I'm going to rely on my wits.
Well, you're halfway there.
You better believe it.
Sam.
Father Berry at Carla's church said we gotta hurry because he's got two weddings planned after Carla's, a bake sale, a slide show of the Knights of Columbus' trip to the Holy Land, and a CYO hootenanny.
Thank you, Woody.
Sam?
Mmm?
I'm, uh I'm thinking of becoming Catholic.
We'll talk about it later.
Hey, Sammy, I got Eddie.
Great.
Where's Mama?
I tipped the cabbie to take her back to the hotel.
You already paid back that buck.
I'm not gonna marry her, Sam.
I mean, I can't go against mémère's wishes.
Maybe some day, after Mama gets to know her and starts to like her.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
What about the planets and the tea leaves?
I mean, if you don't marry her now, you're going to have to wait till 2042.
Sam, it's no use.
I mean, maybe Carla's right.
Ever since I saw her on our wedding day, we've had nothing but bad luck.
You know, I happen to think that it's bad luck to be a jerk to the woman you're in love with.
Now, come on, Eddie.
Just talk to her.
Okay.
I guess I could just talk to her.
Great, great, great, great, great, hold that thought.
How's it going?
Pretty good, pretty good.
It better be, or my butt's in a sling.
Is there room for two in there?
Eddie's arm.
His neck.
How's it going?
Oh, not too bad.
I don't think we've broken anything vital yet.
Eddie's foot.
Sweetheart.
Eddie's femur.
Sit down.
Hey.
Stop, stop.
Would you give the guy a break, please?
He had to break a mirror, right?
He had to spill the salt.
He had to thumb his nose to the Fates, and look what happened.
They turned him into a wuss.
The important thing is that the wuss came back.
Does he have a note from his mommy?
Oh, come on, just talk to the guy.
I don't talk to spineless jellyfish.
All right, fine.
I'll just, uh, go out there and tell him to leave.
Hey.
Does he look really pathetic and cute?
Have you ever seen a puppy in the rain?
Well I guess I can let him off the hook, but first!
He has to come in here, get down on his knees and sweat blood.
He was hoping you'd say that.
You're smiling.
The wedding's on.
Oh, yeah.
This uniform is almost off.
Old engineer Sammy's got the matrimony express right back on schedule.
Eddie.
Eddie, Eddie.
Wait a minute, man.
Whoa.
Where you going?
I can't face her right now.
I mean, even if I did change my mind and decide to stand up to Mama, Carla would never forgive me for the way I ran out.
I mean, if I went in there right now, she'd tear my head off.
Come on, Eddie.
I think you're underestimating Carla just a bit here.
What, you don't think she'll be mad?
No, I don't think she'll stop at your head.
Norm Listen, she wants to forgive you.
All you two need is a few moments together in private.
Okay, but could we do it out here, where there are plenty of witnesses?
All right.
Okay.
Just sit down right here.
Relax.
If he even looks at the door, break his legs.
Sam!
The wedding frock you ordered.
I got some pretty weird looks on the bus with this thing.
There was also one rather interesting invitation.
Sam.
Father Berry.
The other wedding party's starting to stack up in the vestibule.
Ah, I can't talk to him now, man.
I-I gotta talk to Eddie here.
I just talked to Eddie.
I gotta talk to Carla.
Carla?
Mm-hmm.
Carla.
Father Berry?
Listen, Sam can't talk right now, but, uh while I got you on the phone, can I ask you a question?
Do you have to pay any membership dues to be a Catholic?
I told you I wouldn't talk to him unless he comes in here begging.
Come on.
Carla, we don't have time for this nonsense.
Hey, I got an idea.
Get out of your clothes.
Oh, Sammy, any other time I'd love to, but, really Well, I just think that, you know, uh, you're sweaty.
You're tired, Maybe you'd like to change into something else.
Well, hey, like this, for instance.
No way.
Oh, come on.
Just, just try it on.
You know, see how it fits in case you want to get married someday.
Years from now.
Years from now.
Well, you know, I might not be pregnant then.
Right.
Come on.
Oh, what the heck.
This might be the last chance I get to see what I look like in one of these.
Yeah.
Besides, I'm out 36 bucks.
Eddie, Eddie.
Sammy.
I know what you're doing here.
You think I'm going to get all decked out like Miss Bride of the Year, take one look in the mirror and forget all about being mad at Eddie.
and I'm going to go out there, and Eddie's going to take one look at me and forget all about his mother.
Then, we'll march down the aisle and live happily ever after.
Am I right?
Yeah, that's basically it.
You got a problem with that?
Nah, just checking.
Here I come.
Woo-woo.
Sam Do you really mean "woo-woo," or are you just saying "woo-woo"?
No, no.
I don't say "woo-woos" lightly.
Huh?
Holá.
Okay.
Ah, look at you.
Okay.
Let's give it a shot.
All right.
Sammy, zip me.
Well, I'll be darned.
These things go up, too, huh?
Oh, Carla.
You look That's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me.
Oh Oh, listen.
Let's get to the church.
We have to get married before 4:00.
Hot dog!
Care to help me with my pants?
Carla?
It's your church.
Would you tell them we're on our way.
Well, that's just it.
They had to go ahead with the other wedding and cancel yours.
I knew it.
I knew it!
You're out of uniform.
Dear friends, you have come together  It sure was nice of the Monsignor to let Carla and Eddie get married here in the rectory chapel.
Yeah, it was kind of nice of us to buy all those raffle tickets, too.
Good Lord, it's crowded in here.
But on the upside, it does satiate any desire I might have had to visit Tokyo.
Edward, have you come here freely without reservation to give yourself to Carla in marriage?
Edward?
Carla, where's Edward?
Carla?
Where's Carla?
Excuse me.
Excuse me!
Lady with a baby.
Excuse Would you get off the dress!
All right, all right, all right.
Crank it up, Father.
All the forces in the universe say we have to be done by 4:00.
Oh, no!
Do you, Edward Raymond, take Carla Maria Victoria Hurry!
Hurry!
Please, hurry!
Angelina Theresa Apollonia  Oh, rat!
Why couldn't my parents have named me Judy?
Go on, go on, go on.
Hey, here they come!
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the moment we've all been waiting for.
Appearing for the first time anywhere, the happy couple, Mr. and Mrs. Eddie LeBec.
That's a keeper.
Hey, guys, it's your wedding day.
Show a little teeth here, all right?
I can't, Sammy.
We were pronounced man and wife at 4:01.
We might as well have been pronounced dead.
We're doomed.
Music, music!
Aw, come on, you guys.
Think about all the wedding gifts you got to open over there.
Yeah.
I guess I should be grateful Eddy didn't fall down the church steps and break his leg.
How is it, anyway?
I think I just wrenched it a little.
They don't look too happy to me.
No.
They do look married, though.
What's that ugly-looking thing?
It's not an ugly thing.
It's a Wabby.
What's a Wabby, Webecca?
It's a "Women of Boston Business" award.
I'm very proud of it.
It happens to be very prestigious.
Thousands of women have won it.
What's it doing out here?
You trying to impress your boss?
I'm glad you reminded me.
I'm completely forgot he was coming.
Yeah, sure you did.
Hey, you know, every time Evan Drake's name gets mentioned you get a little red around the gills.
Do you have a crush on him or something?
I beg your pardon.
He happens to be a married man.
Although not happily.
Oh, you do have a crush on him.
How cute!
"Oh, Evan, Evan".
Great stuffed mushrooms, Cliffie.
Try the Swedish meatballs.
They're out of this world.
Yeah.
Ooh, try 'em together!
Together!
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Do you plan on leaving any hors d'oeuvres for latecomers?
Hey, you snooze, you lose.
Ooh-ooh!
Rumaki!
Come on.
And now it's time for the traditional first dance, and we all know who's going to start it.
Holy cow, it isn't me, is it?
Let's welcome the happy couple Carla and Eddie to the dance floor.
The greatest love the world has known Hit me again, Harley.
Third time's the charm.
So, uh, where's your big-shot lover boy?
I told you he is not my lover boy.
The big shot SOB is in a meeting.
Choke on it.
There's a happy pair.
Say cheeseburger.
Uh, no, no.
All right, that was a good one, even with Miss Howe's eyes kinda gimpy like that.
Oh, Norm, look.
We forgot about the dessert table.
And we call ourselves guests.
Ma, you want to trade partners?
Why not?
I'm going to die.
I'm going to dance with my mother, all right?
How about a cup of coffee, huh?
Why would I do that?
Well, because I've seen a lot of ladies hit the champagne in my time.
One minute they're doing just fine.
The next minute it kind of sneaks up on them and they're doing all sorts of wild and crazy Why am I giving you coffee?
So, Eddie, what's Mother Tortelli like in bed?
What are you looking at, pretty lady?
I'm looking at you.
Well, I'm looking back at you.
I think I'm beginning to see you in a whole new light.
Why don't you tell me what you see?
You have a really weird face.
Your eyebrows are growing together like a big old ugly caterpillar.
Oh, look, they're cutting the cake.
And now as the hour draws late, it's time for the bride to throw the bouquet.
Okay, come on, come on, everybody.
You all ready?
Okay, heads up, you old maids.
Dr. Crane, a girl's supposed to catch the bouquet.
Well, then the girls should have been a little bit quicker.
Here, knock yourself out.
I think it's time for me to pack it in.
Uh, you know, I don't think you're in any condition to drive, Miss Howe.
Let me give you a lift home, all right?
I don't know.
I've never been alone in a car with such a hairy guy.
Are you sure you weren't in The Planet of The Apes?
Can anybody else please take me home?
There's room in our car.
You can sit on my lap.
Darling, you're married now.
You don't have a lap.
Come on.
You think I'm so ugly?
I'll let you get a bag and put it over my head, all right?
Just a minute.
Let me get my bag.
And yours.
I'm not crazy about the way that girl flirts.
And now, folks, as the lucky couple gets ready to embark on their new life together, let's all throw some rice, the symbol of fertility.
Ow!
Oh, ow!
Ah!
I can't go out here, Eddie.
Why?
No, it's too dangerous.
I'm okay.
Who are we trying to kid here?
We're living in the shadow of the curse we brought on ourselves.
I can't go on with this.
Come on, Carla.
No, no, no.
I think maybe we should get an annulment.
Oh, would you two stop it?
!
I can't believe This should be the happiest day of your lives, and all you've done is moan and groan all day long.
I mean, come on.
It's one thing to play along with this superstition stuff for, you know, for some fun, but you're letting it interfere with your happiness here.
You two are wonderful.
You got everything in your life to look forward to.
Please, please, come on.
Trust me.
Nothing bad is going to happen.
You got my personal word on that.
I mean, superstition, it's for the birds.
Just go on with your normal life.
Woody, do you mind?
All right, fine.
Go ahead.
Answer it.
It's probably just somebody who wants to, uh, know what time the bar closes.
We close at 2:00.
Eddie, it's for you.
Some guy from the Bruins.
Maybe, maybe you oughta Probably just want to congratulate me on my wedding.
Yeah, right.
That's it.
That's it.
Hello.
Oh, hiya, Frank Yeah, how's it going?
It's Frank.
Yeah, uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Okay, yeah.
Yeah, thanks a lot.
Good-bye, Frank.
Do I smell a bonus?
They cut me from the team.
They're going with the youth movement.
They tried to trade me, but nobody wanted me.
I'm sorry, Carla.
I guess all the superstitions finally caught up with us.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
I can blame a lot of things on superstition, but you aren't the greatest goalie in the world, honey.
What are you saying to me, Carla?
Well, you know, the end of last year you were losing it, and now you're older, and your reflexes are shot.
Oh, thanks a lot.
I'm feeling a lot better already.
And if that wasn't because of superstition, then maybe the twins aren't bad luck either.
Could it be possible that I'm just having twins because the eggs split?
Whoa, whoa!
And maybe your mother hates me because she's stupid.
And Anthony hates you because he takes after his no-good rat-faced father.
And all those things that we thought were bad luck had nothing to do with superstition.
It was just life.
Unfortunately, it happens to be my life.
What the heck?
I'm married and in love with a great guy.
So, I guess that evens things up.
No, it doesn't.
But it makes life worth living.
No, it doesn't.
But it's something.
So let's get on with it.
What do you say, hubby?
I say let's get on with the honeymoon, eh?
See you at 2:00 A.M. Somebody's got to work in this family.
Hi.
I'm Mrs. Eddie LeBec.
What'll you have?
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
Sam, I found an apartment.
Hey, good for you, Woody.
It's got everything I ever wanted.
What's that?
A living room and a bedroom.
Dare to dream there, Woodman.
Isn't this in Chinatown?
I don't think so, Sam.
Well, yeah, I think it is.
Did there seem to be a lot of Chinese restaurants around?
Yeah, I guess.
And, uh, a lot of, uh, signs hanging hither and yon in Chinese there?
Yeah, come to think of it.
Yeah, lots of Chinese people walking around on the street, I suppose.
Yeah, but that could just be a coincidence, you know?
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll call my landlady.
If anyone would know, Mrs. Chung would.
Making your way in the world today Takes everything you've got Taking a break from all your worries Sure would help a lot Wouldn't you like to get away?
Sometimes you want to go Where everybody knows your name And they're always glad you came You want to be where you can see Our troubles are all the same You want to be where everybody knows your name You want to go where people know People are all the same You want to go where everybody knows your name.
So, uh, Woody, how's the ol' apartment working out?
Oh, great, Mr. Clavin.
You know my landlady, Mrs. Chung?
Yeah.
She's teaching me a new word in Chinese every day.
The trick is to work it into the conversation smoothly.
Say, Carla, seen any interesting  lately?
What are you babbling about, Festus?
is the Chinese word for "doorknob".
Well, here's a couple of  right here.
Hey, Bobby.
Any new twists in the pretzel business?
Hey, I haven't heard that one before, right, Sammy?
So you want the usual four cases?
Yeah.
Excuse me.
I'm the new manager here.
Congratulations.
So, uh, that's four, right, Sam?
Mm-hmm.
I handle all the ordering around here now.
Really, Sam?
So how many cases do you want?
How many did he say?
Four.
I want five.
She's the boss.
I'll call you later.
I saw that little wink, Mr. Malone, and I don't appreciate it.
I'm tired of you undermining my authority.
Now I want delivery men to deal with me and me only.
Is that clear?
You certainly put me in my place.
Speaking of my place, why don't you grab your negligee and join me?
As disgusting as that offer is  I think I'll have to decline.
And I'm taking your picture down.
Whoa, whoa, wait a sec.
You don't understand.
I mean, it's a tradition around here.
It's always hung there.
Mr. Malone, I'm afraid things are different now.
This isn't your bar anymore.
: Things are different now.
This isn't your bar.
Don't do that.
I hate that.
: What?
I just, uh, bit my tongue, that's all.
: Way to go, Sammy.
Give me a scotch, Woody.
Sure thing, Dr. Crane.
Hey, by the way, when you go to the restroom, I want you to notice that the  have been shined.
I'm hardly concerned about doorknobs at the moment.
You understood me?
Yes.
It was only a matter of time.
Well, doesn't anybody care to know what I am concerned about?
No.
Well, Fras, you know normally, I wouldn't give a rat's tokus about anything that happened to you, but the last guy I waited on threw up on my leg.
Now, this couldn't be any worse, right?
Shoot.
It's my love life.
I'm gonna go find the guy that threw up on my leg.
What's up, Frasier?
Well, Sam, this morning, Lilith and I had the worst fight we've ever had.
And I'm almost ashamed to admit it, but I I even considered striking her.
I mean, it wasn't completely without provocation.
She did throw a chair at me.
Just it's the same argument we've had all the time lately.
It Only this time, she-she issued an ultimatum.
She she said we ought to get married, or we're through.
Well, Frasier Crane does not cotton to emotional blackmail.
Frasier, propose to her.
Get it over with.
The truth is, she's got her hook in you.
Well, Sam, I'm not a fish.
I'm a man.
There is a difference.
I know that.
A fish would stand a chance.
Trust me, propose.
I couldn't, uh, help but overhear what you were talking about there, Fras.
Yeah.
: We tried like hell, but, uh, we heard it anyway.
Well, it's not that I don't care for Lilith.
It-It's just that I fear I-I tied myself to her because, well, you know, I haven't been all that successful with women.
Ah.
For some reason, I don't think they find me sexy.
Get out!
Guys, huh?
Come on!
Uh, you know, Fras, I wouldn't kick you out of bed for eating crackers.
Maybe subconsciously, I've-I've settled for Lilith because she's the only woman that ever liked me for well, not my brain.
Oh, Frasier, please.
I know of plenty of women, they-they find you attractive.
Yeah Oh, look, I know you're just being nice No.
but you see, I'm not really trying to shop around.
I mean, Lilith Sternin is a a good woman.
Strong, durable, reliable.
She'd make a hell of a radial tire, actually.
Oh, I'm just too young for a commitment.
You see, I haven't been with all that many women.
Especially ones with a caboose like that.
Well, Fras, uh, talk about a small world.
You know it's common knowledge around here that Miss Howe finds you très attractive.
Oh, now stop it.
She does not.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Gentlemen, gentlemen, am I blowing smoke here, or am I giving the man the straight skinny?
It's true.
He's right, Frasier.
Rebecca likes the cut of your jib.
Well, the Cranes always have been known for their jibs.
No, seriously.
It's outlandish.
I mean, the woman hasn't even given me an indication.
Uh, I don't know, Fras.
You know, I think you'll find, uh, where there's smoke, there's, uh, fire.
Could I have a club soda, please, Woody?
Oh, sure thing, Miss Howe.
Thank you.
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?
Were we right, or were we right, huh?
I mean, there must be some mistake.
What?
A mistake?
!
She was coming on to me?
No, no, she was trying to wipe something off her lip.
: Oh, yeah.
Doc, Doc, she talks about you all the time.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, yeah.
Look, look, if you don't believe us, uh, just go over there and ask her out.
You'll have your answer.
All right, I'll do it.
I mean, it's not like I haven't had any encouragement.
I can come hither as well as the next guy.
Is this the men's room?
It's around the corner.
Oh, uh, terribly sorry.
Well, I've laid the groundwork.
I can just follow up that up tomorrow.
Oh, right now, I'm running late for dinner so I better get back.
You know, Lilith goes into a blinding rage if I'm not home the minute the meat hits the platter.
Guys thanks for being here for me.
My compadres, huh?
Yeah.
No, no, no, no.
That was really That was a terrible thing to do.
Yeah.
Yeah, uh, I-I wonder why we did it.
'Cause we're a bunch of nimrods.
"Your hostess, Rebecca Howe".
What is this supposed to be?
Something to identify me to people who might have questions, comments or suggestions.
I saw one in a supermarket and thought it was a good idea.
I've seen headcheese in the supermarket, too, but I don't frame it.
I guess what I'm saying is, I love it.
I don't want to hear another word about this, Mr. Malone.
I know you have trouble dealing with a woman in a position of authority.
Whoa, wait a minute.
I resent that.
I've never had trouble with a woman in any position.
That's exactly what I'm talking about.
You give me no respect.
Now, maybe you took this job lightly when you were in charge, but I take it very seriously.
And as for you, Mrs. LeBec, I would think that as another working woman that perhaps you would lend me some support.
Instead of always sniping behind my back.
What do you see we just wipe the slate clean here and start a new era of mutual support?
Wonderful idea.
Absolutely.
You know, I don't think we're ever going to able to look at you the same way again.
Great.
Good evening, gents.
Frasier.
Frasier.
Carla, how about some suds there?
Yup.
Hey, Fras, what's up?
Well, my spirits for one thing.
I've just told Lilith that I want my freedom, so that I can pursue the fair Rebecca.
Wait a minute, now, wait.
You dumped Lilith, 'cause of what Cliff said?
What I said?
You're the one Gentlemen, gentlemen.
There's plenty of credit for both of you.
You two opened my eyes, made me realize that there are other fish in the sea.
So what did Lilith have to say when you flushed her?
Well, I don't actually know yet.
Uh, I was going to tell her face-to-face, but then I thought that an eloquently written letter would be a bittersweet reminder of what we had together.
You chickened out?
Precisely.
Well  to the hunt.
Yes?
Hello, Rebecca.
Why do I suddenly feel nervous as a schoolboy?
Uh Well, let me-let me come directly to the point by telling you that you couldn't have chosen a more opportune moment to declare your feelings.
Let me assure you, the feeling is mutual.
I've just recently rid myself of an entanglement.
I find myself free to ask you if you'd like to join me for dinner.
Who are you?
My God.
What have I done?
You leaving so soon, Dr. Crane?
Yes, Woody, I've got to convince the woman I love that I'm not a complete ass.
Good luck!
Oh, thank God.
What was that, Tootsie Roll?
I said, uh, thank God I'm home.
I couldn't agree more.
How was your day at the office?
It was fine.
How was yours?
Delightful.
Here, I'll just make us a couple of drinks, and then we can start relaxing.
Where is the envelope you left for me on the table?
Envelope?
What envelope?
Frasier.
It's wicked of you to tease me.
I saw it, but wanted to save it to open while you were here.
It's probably either tickets to the ballet or the symphony.
Or perhaps one of those cards with a handsome couple walking hand in hand on the beach at sunset that I cherish so.
You know, that is exactly what it was.
Good Lord, I guess I'm becoming quite predictable.
You know, I'll just have to think of another way to enchant you.
I've got it.
Look, it's a flock of seagulls.
Let's have our drink.
Here's to the most beautiful woman in the world.
Let me guess-- you read the letter.
Yes, I read the letter, you licentious quack!
And what facile tripe it is!
"We both need time to grow, to develop as people".
Who is the slut?
She's no slut!
What slut?
Well, I mean, look, it was all a mistake.
It's just a big mistake.
Oh, you bet it is, mister.
You want your freedom?
!
Ha, I'll give you freedom-- from your teeth!
No, Lilith!
Not the Royal Doulton.
You're right.
I realize when I contemplate the destruction of property that I'm overstepping the bounds of decorum.
If there's any hope of our salvaging any of our relationship, we must remain calm and discuss this in a rational, truthful manner.
All right.
I'll be honest with you.
There was a woman.
But I am a man of honor.
I did not betray you.
Nothing happened.
You broke off our relationship for the possibility of a relationship?
A mere fantasy?
How flattering.
All right, I'll be honest with you.
You see, I only wanted to spare you.
This woman is a a sex-starved Circe who drew my ship onto the rocks and there I foundered.
What's her name?
Well, let's just, you know, leave her name out of this.
Frasier, are we going to clear the air or continue to hold back?
Unless you identify this woman, doubt and suspicion will fester in my consciousness.
Every woman I meet will provoke the question, "Is this the one, is this the one, is this the one, is this the one is this the one"?
It's Rebecca Howe.
She runs Cheers now.
So, now we know the slut's name.
Please, Lilith don't you think you could forgive me?
I don't know.
At this moment, my feelings for you are ambivalent.
I need to sort them out.
I'm going to go out and wander the streets aimlessly.
I'll take my usual route.
You know, I have an idea, Popsicle.
Uh, why don't I run upstairs and make us a nice warm, soothing bath, hmm?
Well, Mr. Bubble does always cheer me so.
Once begun, it's half done.
Are you sure this is okay with Miss Howe?
Woody, she loves this kind of stuff.
This is good, wholesome humor.
In fact, I bet she gives you a raise for doing such a good job.
Oh, don't stop.
I already saw it.
And I must admit, I haven't laughed so hard since junior high.
I helped.
Mr. Malone.
Yeah?
I want this nonsense with my picture to stop.
I did you a favor by hiring you back, and this is not a very nice way to repay me.
You're right.
You did do me a favor, and now I'm going to do you one.
I'm going to give you a tip on how to deal with people who work for you.
Lighten up a little bit.
I mean, you got to make some compromises.
I see.
You want me to hang your picture back up.
Right.
Done.
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, that was easy.
Wait, uh let's try some more compromises here.
Um I want to sleep with you you don't want to sleep with me at all, am I right?
Right.
Okay, so what's half of 25?
Your I.Q.?
Wait, uh please.
Um, I'm a little sensitive about people making fun of my intelligence.
I'm sorry.
That's all right.
But I wasn't making fun of your intelligence.
Good.
I was making fun of your lack of intelligence.
Cliffie, girl fight, 12:00 high.
Rebecca Howe?
Mm-hmm.
You and I are both mature women, and I think we should handle this openly and with civility.
Believe me, I could be doing you a very big favor.
Frasier is not an easy man to live with.
He's obsessively compulsive about neatness.
The sex is good, but he pouts unless you compliment his performance.
Fortunately, his male ego can be satisfied with a simple "Thank you, Conan".
I don't know who you are, and I don't know who Frasier is, but I do Conan?
You really don't know Frasier, do you?
No, I don't.
God, I'm such a fool.
How could I let him do this to me?
It's all right.
It happens to everybody.
He made up this whole story just to avoid committing to me.
And the worst part is he's going to get away with it.
They always do.
Yeah, men are such a pain.
I have someone who's very special to me, but he wouldn't notice me if I set fire to my hair.
Him?
No, definitely not him.
I prefer the Fortune 500 type-- one who owns blocks, not one who plays with them.
Look, they're flirting with me.
Well, I really do have work to do.
Perhaps we can have lunch together sometime.
I'd like that.
Lilith.
Lilith.
Well, good night.
Good night.
Mr. Malone, are you developing a tic?
That was a wink.
Then you're developing into a tick.
And stop looking at my rear end.
Lucky guess.
Lilith.
Thank God you're here.
You haven't confronted Rebecca yet, have you?
Hardly.
Oh, good.
How did you know where I was?
Well, when I realized you hadn't come upstairs, I-I toweled off, and then suddenly, it dawned on me-- that little firebrand's gone down to Cheers to fight for her man.
See, I think it best that I do this myself, and, uh I think next week's a really good time.
You did have an affair with this woman, didn't you?
That is what you told me.
Well, of course.
Well, then end it right here and now.
I need to know that it's over.
You've got to cut this off before she falls more deeply in love with you.
And you've got to let me watch.
You know, I-I've got an idea.
Let's go to Maine.
Lilith Lilith, Lilith the left-hand side of my body's gone completely numb.
You know what that means, don't you?
Yes, you're stalling.
It's down the hall to the left.
Thank you.
Ms. Howe, let me introduce myself.
I'm Lilith Sternin.
You don't know me, but of course this man needs no introduction.
He only needs a conscience.
Frasier has something he wants to say to you.
Listen very carefully and do what you must do.
I'm I'm sorry, Rebecca, but it's-it's-it's time it was over.
I hope you can forgive me.
Now let's go to Maine.
Frasier, don't be so heartless.
She deserves better than that.
Uh, uh, no, no, please, please, don't try to articulate your feelings.
Uh just let me say my little piece, and then I'll be out of your life forever.
Now, just remember the part about not saying anything.
I know it sounds like a cliché to to say that this is going to hurt me more than it does you but it doesn't make it any less true for you see, it is I who will be condemned never again to see your haunting eyes, your silken skin, your shimmering hair.
But it-it's time that we part.
Farewell, sweet Rebecca.
How will I live without your passionate kisses?
You won't have to.
Oh, Frasier Frasier, for God's sakes, she was only joking.
Well, so was I. Come on.
I was just playing along.
I'm a dead man.
Sweetheart?
Buttercup?
You were just kidding, weren't you?
My joy!
Lilith.
Please, uh, all I can say is please have mercy on me.
I Look, it's the God's honest truth.
Rebecca and I did not have an affair.
I wanted to, but she wasn't sure A small point, but she wasn't even sure who I am, so I didn't really want to.
Uh, my body wanted to, but my brain didn't.
Well, part of my brain did, but Well, that part's dead, and I guess what I'm trying to say is Will you marry me, make me the happiest man alive?
This is obviously a ploy to get yourself out of the ridiculous situation you're in, and the answer is yes, my steed, yes.
Are you you're serious?
Yippee.
Hey, everybody, we're going to be married.
Someday.
No, soon.
Eh, we finally got those lovebirds together, huh?
Yeah, just needed that little push, I guess.
: Matchmaker, matchmaker Make me a match
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
Boy, look at her.
What a glow she has.
You know, strange as it sounds, there are actually times when I resent being a man.
Ah, that's all right, Fras.
Sometimes we resent you being one.
I was referring to Carla's condition.
You see, she's able to do something we men never shall-- experience the miracle of creating a new life.
You know, I'll have to admit.
I've often wondered what it would like to have another human being moving around inside you.
Must be spooky, but real neato.
Yeah.
There's probably nothing so awesome in the entire universe.
Yes, gentlemen, I'm afraid that we've been relegated to the position of observer.
Passive, sitting on the sidelines.
Doomed by nature to a life of envy.
God, feels like there's a dump truck parked on my bladder.
Well, then again, nature is wise in her way.
Making your way in the world today Takes everything you've got Taking a break from all your worries Sure would help a lot Wouldn't you like to get away?
Sometimes you want to go Where everybody knows your name And they're always glad you came You want to be where you can see Our troubles are all the same You want to be where everybody knows your name You want to go where people know People are all the same You want to go where everybody knows your name.
What makes me think this belongs to you?
My jasmine scented oriental massage oil.
Oh, God.
God, I thought I'd lost this.
I found it wedged underneath the couch cushions in my office.
Ah.
I don't think I want to know how it got there.
I'm kind of curious.
Tell you what.
Why don't you, uh, put that back where you found it, and that way, we'll know where it is when we need it.
When hell freezes over.
Well, that's perfect, 'cause this stuff heats up when you rub it in.
Now, what what's wrong with her, you know?
Maybe one of the chains in her underwear is twisted.
Afternoon, everybody.
Norm!
Hey.
What's going on, Mr. Peterson?
Let's talk about what's going in Mr. Peterson.
Beer, Woody.
How's the job-hunting going?
Oh, lots better, Sam.
Today I actually got turned down for an executive position.
It's a good way to lose that.
I'm sorry, Mr. Peterson.
You've been cut off.
Oh.
Okay, where's the camera?
This is no joke.
According to my books, you are way over your credit limit.
Well, what's the big deal?
What's he over-- ten, 20 bucks?
But in other words, under $900, huh?
You can't cut off one of our regulars.
The poor guy is unemployed.
Look, Miss Howe, uh, Norm here is in a very delicate spot.
His self-confidence has been shattered.
Uh, what he needs from us now is help and support.
Isn't there some other way to resolve this problem?
Well, you could pay his bar bill.
Norm, the woman will not listen to reason.
Maybe he could work it off, huh?
No, I'm serious.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.
Listen, maybe there's some accounting he could do for the bar.
Our corporation's books are handled by Franklin, Sussman and Gurwitz.
Ooh, they're very good, Sam.
They canned me a couple years ago.
Please.
Are you good at anything?
Yeah, but you cut him off.
No, no.
Come on, don't you have any other skills?
I can barbecue.
Oh, hey, hey.
Yeah.
All right, well, I, uh I did a little house painting in college.
You know, to make ends meet.
: Norm, Norm, Norm.
Norm, I think they're talking about a job where you get, uh, paid with money, not with little grain pellets dropped out of a chute.
Cliff, you, uh, you got something against painters?
: No, no, no.
I I'm in favor of hiring the blithering.
Do do you need any painting done around here?
I guess you could repaint the office.
Are you willing?
It's been an awfully long time.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
It's gonna take you at least, what, seven or eight seconds to relearn that skill.
'Cause, you know, Cliff, I'm beginning to pick up a little thread here.
Uh Ah.
Would you mind explaining this little obsession you have about painters?
Well, all right.
Uh, well, it's manual labor.
I mean, it's beneath you, Norm.
Well, if you take a job like this, we're gonna be on entirely different social strata.
We'll have nothing to talk about, all right?
Semigloss or enamel?
Hey, Woody, would you close up for me tonight?
I got to get home.
No problem, Carla.
By the way, I really am envious of you having a nice big family to go home to.
Oh, yeah, it's great, all right.
I got 11 people living under a roof that was meant for only six.
Gino's dog just had puppies on my side of the bed.
My daughter-in-law is driving me nuts, and somehow, my mother-in-law got a hold of our address.
Puppies.
You lucky duck.
You seem to be enjoying yourself.
Oh, sorry.
Uh No, that's all right.
Oh, uh, you got a phone call here, uh Eva Ake?
I could swear it was a man.
Oh, well, there's paint here.
Evan Drake.
Uh That's my boss.
Yeah.
What did he say?
Well, he said, he, uh he wants you to tear up my bar bill.
I Well I didn't think I'd get away with that.
Uh, but, no, he said he's on his way over here.
Sometime, like, uh around nowish.
Now?
!
God.
Shall I, uh, comb my hair, too, or will I be leaving?
This is just a business meeting.
Rebecca Howe.
Oh, hello, Mr. Drake.
I thought you were-- Norm.
No, no, no, I know you're not Norm.
You're Evan.
What I meant to say was-- Get out of here.
No, no, no, not you.
You stay right where you are.
No, I swear Get out!
Oh.
Hello?
Well, that was fast, Mr. P. Yeah, she got a phone call from Mr. Drake.
Hey, Mr. Peterson, I really feel bad about you being cut off.
Yeah.
You know, I remember the good old days when you used to come in here and say something funny.
I'd pour you a beer.
You'd drink it, I'd pour you another one, you'd drink that, too.
Yeah.
Yeah, I remember, Woody.
So look at that-- hardly even touched.
Yeah.
I'll tell you, I don't normally drink beer, but, uh, I just cleaned the taps, and I wanted to make sure that everything was all right, so I had one.
It was like a mountain stream, only colder, fresher.
You know, sometimes there's nothing like a nice cold beer to really hit the spot.
Yeah, I think I read that somewhere, Woody.
You know, I-I really like this color.
I think it's gonna really spruce up the office quite a bit.
Again, it's just an opinion.
Uh  Is there something wrong?
Right.
Well, yes, I understand, of course.
Here, here, have a seat, have a seat.
Just relax.
Oh, God.
Here.
Some authority figure.
I'm sorry.
It's probably just job stress.
Oh, you shouldn't be having job stress.
You're doing a great job here.
Oh, tell that to Mr. Drake.
He said I should consider the last fiscal report a personal embarrassment.
Norm, I need your help.
Uh, you just started.
You're-you're gonna do fine.
Things are gonna turn around, I swear.
Uh No, you idiot.
My hair's stuck to the wall.
Oh, great.
No, no, it's really It's not, uh not that bad.
I paid big bucks to have Vera's hair frosted.
Didn't turn out half as good.
Well, maybe I better take off.
When people are upset, they they like to be alone.
Nonsense.
I'm fine.
Talking about me.
I'm feeling a little queasy.
Oh, please stay.
I mean, this office is a real inconvenience like this.
All right.
Would you, uh, would you like to talk about what just happened?
No.
Phew.
You really do seem to be enjoying this job.
Yeah.
Yeah, I actually do, you know?
I think painting is just so vastly different from accounting.
This is real, you know?
This I have some control over.
I mean, when I look back, I finish a job, I can say, "You know, I did that".
Door must have moved.
You know, I think that this color is the exact same color as Mary Lou Sebold's car coat.
Who?
This girl I had an insane crush on in the third grade.
Except she had no idea that I was alive.
I used to leave little notes for her.
"I love you".
And one day, I finally got up the nerve to sign one, N.P. The next week, she was going steady with my best friend, Nicky Petropolis.
What'd you do?
The only thing I could do, really.
I went over to Nicky, and I calmly explained the situation.
Then I sat on him.
Oh, God.
I think that's the first time I've really laughed since I took over here.
Oh, it is, trust me.
Why'd you tell me that story?
Well, I don't know.
It's kind of late.
We're alone.
I'm a man, you're a woman.
Maybe it's the paint talking.
Norm?
Yeah.
Do you find me cold?
You?
Cold?
No.
No, I wouldn't say cold.
Coolish.
In the brisk area, but, uh Why?
Who, uh who says you're cold?
Everyone.
Oh.
Well I don't think you're cold.
Really?
Yeah.
I always meant to tell you that, but I didn't feel as though I could approach you.
Thank you, Norm.
Oh.
Thank you.
Uh, well, I'd better get out of here.
Um, would you mind locking up for me?
No, no, I don't mind at all.
Listen, would you please not, uh, mention that I like painting to the guys?
Cliff already thinks I'm a weenie.
Well, from what I've seen, he's an authority.
Yeah.
Well And, really, thanks for letting me paint an office that clearly didn't need it.
No problem.
You're a nice man, Norm.
You're kind of nice yourself.
I guess we like each other.
Guess so.
Great.
This will just be our little secret.
Oh, yeah.
I am a little worried about the direction this bar is taking.
How so?
Well, it just doesn't seem right when the stakes for a game of pool is a round of wine spritzers.
Not even the pool room is safe from the encroaching hordes of yuppiedom.
How long will it be until we're all suffocated beneath an avalanche of alligator shirts, German cars, and racquetball club memberships?
Oh, oh, by the way, Sam, uh, may I have another Perrier with lime?
Have a cup of coffee or something, Sam?
Make it a beer.
On the house.
I say we check the office for pods from outer space.
I wonder what that's all about, huh?
Look, did it ever occur to any of you that she just might be a nice woman?
Oh, yeah, right.
And so am I.  So, how come you guys are so chummy, huh?
Sorry, Sam.
Can't talk about it.
Kind of private.
Oh, give me a break.
Guys are supposed to talk about girls behind their backs.
Didn't I tell you everything about me and Diane?
Well, now's your chance to thank me.
I'm not really at liberty to go into details.
Suffice it to say, Miss Howe had a little personal crisis last night, okay?
Few tears were shed.
Real tears?
You sure she didn't just pull a hair out of her nose?
No, Carla.
She got a little sad, and I happened to be there to comfort her.
I think it really just takes a little warmth and compassion, and she warms right up to you.
Compassion, huh?
Mr. Malone.
Mm-hmm.
Do you realize we're running low on seltzer?
I'm so sorry.
Ho-How can these things happen?
Is there anything I can do?
Yes, let me know next time.
Well, of course I will.
I just hope that's enough.
Are you feeling all right?
Yes, thank you very much.
That's very sweet of you to ask.
Norm, I gave you my address, didn't I?
Yep.
See you tomorrow.
See you.
Whoa, what was that all about?
Just a little bit of painting at her apartment.
Listen, uh, you know, I can really sympathize with your situation of painting.
Uh, you know, if the fumes and everything bothers you, you can always spend the night at my place.
I don't think so.
That's it.
I say she's a guy.
Good night, Sammy.
Say, uh Norm, wait a second here.
You know you know, I like to paint.
Why don't I help you, man, you know.
Come on.
No.
I know you.
You just want to log a little sack time with her.
Come on, no.
The truth is, I just I got to find out if there's a real human being in there, man.
I-I can't keep working for a cold fish.
Please, come on.
All right.
But no funny stuff.
No, I swear to God.
I won't touch her.
I won't touch her.
I make no guarantees about you.
You've been driving me crazy in this little white outfit.
Yeah?
You should see me in my caftan.
Oh, hi, Norm.
Come on in.
Thank you.
I was just Hi.
Oh, God.
Now it knows where I live.
Sorry, I, uh, needed a helper, and when I checked around, most of the fellas expected to be paid.
And you're doing this for nothing?
Well, it's an act of compassion.
I'm doing this out of the goodness of my heart.
Norm.
Yeah.
I'd like all the wood here and the moldings done in high gloss.
Great.
You have any questions, if you need anything, I'll be in the back.
Okay.
So that's where the old bedroom is, huh?
Sammy?
What?
I'm not doing anything.
You promised.
No, I'm fine.
All right, I want to start with, uh, sanding for you.
Here.
All right.
All right, uh, try this post right here.
Yeah.
I'll do a little taping.
Hey, come on.
Hey, Sam.
What?
Sam, uh you have to do it with the grain, okay?
Oh.
Sand with the grain.
My arm hurts when I do it like that.
Very sorry, Sam.
That's the way it has to be done, all right?
I don't think I like sanding.
Just try to tape one pane at a time, all right?
I don't think I like taping, either.
Norm.
Hmm?
It's Carla on the phone.
Your wife needs you at home right away.
Something about two feet of water in the basement.
Oh, boy, that's serious.
That's, like, a foot more than usual.
I'm sorry.
It's just a little delay.
I'll be right back.
No problem.
Sammy, can I, uh, trust you here alone?
Yeah.
Swear to God I won't touch her.
Tragic, huh?
Absolutely tragic.
I beg your pardon?
Oh, I just couldn't help thinking about Norm's basement.
Yes?
Well, it's not just, you know, the water filling up.
You know, it's those photo albums, those old letters.
Cherished mementos, you know, ru-ruined for : Oh, I'm sorry.
Ooh, boy.
Oh, this is embarrassing.
I-I'm sorry.
I just, uh : I can't help feeling this way ever since my dog, Lucky, died.
Something is going on here.
I'm not exactly sure what it is.
Could it be that you're jerking me around?
Okay, uh  I'm sorry.
It's just that there's a rumor going around the bar that you've got this soft side, and I just thought I'd like to see it for myself.
Maybe get to know you better.
I guess I ought to just Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
I want to get this straight.
You came over here on your day off to paint my living room in hopes of getting to know me better?
Pretty silly, huh?
What'd you want to know?
Well?
Um, I'm thinking.
I-I didn't think I was gonna get this far.
Uh Well, all right, all right, Um where were you born?
San Diego.
San Diego.
California, huh?
No, Kansas.
Come on.
My father's a captain in the Navy.
My mother's an interior designer.
My brother's a surgeon.
My other brother's an attorney.
My sister was Miss San Diego.
The only really happy moment of my life is when I ran away to San Francisco and hung out with Grace Slick.
Do you want to know the lyrics to "White Rabbit," or can I quit now?
Ah.
Boy, it sounds like some of the kids in your family are pretty successful, huh?
Yeah, well, if you measure success in terms of wealth, happiness, and my father's undying devotion, maybe.
Yeah.
Boy, I know.
I got a brother like that.
International lawyer.
Handsome, smart, funny.
And the guy plays the piano, and he speaks four languages, flies his own jet.
Seems like my whole life I've been trying to get out from under his shadow.
I know just what you mean.
Does he ever come in the bar?
No, but, uh, I'll call him, if you'll call Miss San Diego.
Nah.
They'd probably end up leaving together.
Well, hell, this is kind of a warm and friendly moment, isn't it?
I must admit, it's a better moment than I ever thought I'd have with you.
I'm glad this happened.
Yeah, me, too.
Me, too.
Will you excuse me a moment?
Sure.
What are you going to do?
I think I better change.
Honesty.
Who would have thought?
Say, can I, uh-- great, great-- can I, uh, put on some music here?
Sure, be my guest.
I'm gonna be at the gym for a couple of hours.
But you just go right on You jerk.
Wha what?
This whole thing about coming over here and painting is just another stupid attempt to get me into bed.
I-I am shocked and and deeply insulted.
God.
I told you all that personal stuff about my brothers and my sister and me being the fattest girl in high school.
Wait a minute.
You didn't tell me that.
Well, I wasn't.
Get out.
Slow down here.
Just li I admit it.
I'm a attracted to you.
Now, what's the big deal?
Is that a crime or something?
You know, are you always this defensive about people who find you sexy?
No, just you.
Is that right?
Well you know, I'll tell you something, lady.
There was a time when I was considering making love to you, but now it's out of the question.
As a matter of fact, you know, I wouldn't make love to you if you asked me, if you begged me to make love to you, I wouldn't.
Go ahead, just ask me.
Just try it.
See what happens.
Would you make love to me?
Well, okay, but just once.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
Let's just concentrate on the, uh, left side, okay?
Yeah.
We have a boy.
No, no, wait, wait.
It's a girl.
It's a boy again.
This is weird.
All right, maybe it's a girl.
I-I Still trying to figure out what Carla is, huh?
No, Cliff, we're trying to find out what sex my babies are.
See, if the ring goes back and forth, it's a boy.
If it goes around in a circle, it's a girl.
And if it just dangles there doing nothing, it's a Clavin.
I can tell you something we used to, uh, do on the farm.
We'd take a fresh laid chicken egg and we'd put on a spoon and hold it over the woman's stomach.
If it dipped down, it was female, if not, male.
So how often did you predict the sex of the babies?
Never.
This was to predict the sex of the chicken.
All right, you take a spoon, right?
Making your way in the world today Takes everything you've got Taking a break from all your worries Sure would help a lot Wouldn't you like to get away?
Sometimes you want to go Where everybody knows your name And they're always glad you came You want to be where you can see Our troubles are all the same You want to be where everybody knows your name You want to go where people know People are all the same You want to go where everybody knows your name.
Good afternoon, everybody.
Sam, you got you room for one more tosspot?
Let me have a beer, will you?
You betcha.
How you been there, Frasier?
Well, you know how it is for a psychiatrist this day and age.
Divorces, hopelessness over financial situations, rampant paranoia.
Thriving, never better.
Oh, and get this.
I just heard a little bit of information about someone with whom we're all acquainted.
Is it juicy?
Well, yes.
Could it embarrass someone?
Oh, most definitely.
Is it me?
No.
Spill it.
Well, I had lunch today with an ex-colleague of mine who attended the University of Connecticut at the same time as a certain Miss Rebecca Howe.
Now, it seems that this particular Rebecca Howe was known as-- well, let's just say it-- the party girl on campus.
Our Rebecca?
Miss Granite Panties?
The one who goes through life with her knees bolted together?
It's got to be a mistake.
Yeah, yeah So, does anyone know what college ours went to?
It wouldn't surprise me one bit if it was Rebecca.
I don't know.
No, I mean, it's us quiet, reserved types who, when properly stimulated, turn into your average churning hunk of burning funk.
Now, Cliffie, uh, can you tell me exactly at what point in your life you came to that big fork in the road where reality took a left and you hung a sharp right?
Excuse me, is there a Cliff Clavin here?
Uh, would Mr. Clavin know what this is about?
Yeah, I'm a neighbor of his, Jim McNulty.
His mother said he'd be here.
All right, just a minute.
Uh, Mr. Clavin, you here for a Jim McNulty?
Uh, yeah, yeah, sure.
Uh, you know how it is.
Some guys in bars don't like you to know they're here.
Hey, Cliff, remember me?
Yeah, yeah.
Jim McNulty.
You own a house down at the corner.
You ever going to take those Christmas lights down?
Yeah, as soon as a weekend goes by you don't have another garage sale.
Listen, I, uh, I've been going around to good neighbors like yourself hoping I can get your support.
Well, uh what am I looking at here?
Oh, it's a petition agreeing not to sell out to these big developers who've been trying to buy up our houses and build mini malls.
Jimbo, Jimbo, Jimbo.
You know, new development only increases property values.
I wouldn't sign that petition if you beat me senseless.
You know, it may be too late, but let's give it a try.
You know, I'll never understand people like you.
You got no conscience, no sense of community, no interest in keeping our neighborhood beautiful.
If you, uh, want to beautify the neighborhood, why don't you stay indoors?
Yeah, at least I don't live with my mother.
I don't blame you; I've seen your mother.
Yeah, my mother's a saint.
: Yeah-- Saint Bernard.
Oh, yeah?
Forget it.
Ah, I'm outta luck.
Somebody's already using the pool table.
The lady in question.
Sam, Sam, find out where she went to college.
Yeah, okay.
Afternoon, Sam.
Hey, boss.
How's business today?
Oh, pretty slow.
Me and the guys just sitting around talking about where everybody went to college.
You were?
Well, I was wondering what it would be like to go to college.
Well, picture a place with 20,000 people all acting the way you do.
Sounds like fun.
Listen, uh, where did you go to college?
The University of Connecticut.
Am I missing something here?
No, no, no, no, not at all.
We, uh, we're just, uh, such big fans of their football team, you know, the fighting insurance salesmen.
Boy, oh, boy.
Don't you just love this Yorkshire pudding, Ma?
That's a real delicacy.
The English didn't think so.
Actually, Yorkshire pudding was invented in the late 1770s during a beef shortage.
A person could be given a little bit of beef and soak up the gravy with the pudding, thereby fooling his stomach into thinking he was having a fuller dinner than he actually was.
And you wonder why nobody asks us out anymore.
So how was your day?
Ah, okay, Ma.
Oh, our neighbor, Nut Butt McNulty stopped in Cheers today.
He was, uh, circulating some kind of petition.
The one to stop development?
Yeah.
I signed it.
You did?
Well, who in his right mind wouldn't?
Besides you, of course.
Ma, we-we-we're for progress here.
If we don't stop these people, we could lose our home.
Well, it's probably about time we got out of this rattrap anyway.
Clifford.
This "rattrap" is where you, for want of a better term, grew up.
I think it's time somebody looked at the scrapbook.
Aw, come on, Ma.
Not the scrapbook.
Yes, Clifford, the scrapbook.
Misty watercolor memories of the way we were.
Oh.
Look at this one.
Ah No, Ma.
I'm not gonna look.
You're not gonna get me this time.
Oh, we had fun that day.
Ma!
It is not working.
Oh, I'd forgotten this one.
This has got to be the handsomest picture of you I ever laid eyes on.
Which?
Oh, Ma, come on.
My ears are even covered with acne.
I'm your mother, Clifford.
I'm looking at your soul.
Ah, there's me sliding down the old banister.
I always thought you spent entirely too much time doing that.
Eh Eh, it was fun.
Oh, look, there's your favorite hiding place in the closet.
Yeah, yeah.
You used to be in there for hours.
Yeah.
Well, that's 'cause you always locked the door on me, Ma.
Well, look at the result.
You're a very polite young man.
Oh, now there's where we planted the elm tree in the yard.
Yeah.
Oh, you named him Elmer.
Mm-hmm.
And look at our Elmer now.
So tall and strong.
Just like my boy.
Yeah, yeah, I can remember raising him from a sapling, Ma.
I even carved my first slingshot out of his branches.
And cried every winter when the leaves fell.
Yeah, yeah, that tree is like a brother to me, Ma.
Just imagine, you know, something that I planted, and I nurtured, is gonna be there for future generations to enjoy.
Unless they chop it down to put up a Jiffy Lube.
Come on, Ma, they wouldn't do that, would they?
They'll do that as soon as look at you.
Well Oh, Ma, no, they won't.
Oh No, Ma They're not gonna cut down my tree!
A-and they're not gonna touch this house either!
And they're not gonna take our land!
That's my boy.
Where are you going?
Well, it may sound a little bit silly and all, Ma, but, uh I'm gonna go out there and sit in my tree.
You got right ahead.
Never fails.
Well, uh, interestingly enough, Yorkshire pudding was invented in the 1700s during a beef shortage.
All right, stop everything.
I've got a major news flash.
I just had lunch with Miss Howe's former college classmate and it seems that she had a nickname at UConn.
Give, give.
Well, he wasn't sure how she came by this appellation, but it seems that at some point during her little sojourn there, she became known as "Backseat Becky".
Boy.
What do you suppose that means?
Woody.
What that means is when Miss Cliff, Cliff.
Why don't you let someone who's been there, tell it?
Wood, she likes to do her cushion pushin' on four wheels.
Miss Howe?
Really?
You know, uh, back where I come from, we used to say something about girls like that.
What?
"Let's date 'em".
Oh, looky here.
You know, something tells me I'm going to be completely obnoxious about this.
What's so funny?
Oh, we were just talking about nicknames, you know.
Different funny nicknames that people have.
Did you ever have a nickname?
As a matter of fact, no.
Really.
Nothing, huh?
Not a Spark or Lefty or Bubba or something?
Sorry.
Guys, we ought to give Rebecca, here, a nickname, uh You know, something that, uh, kinda fits her personality.
All right.
Kinda dignified.
Kinda businesslike.
Kinda reserved.
Let me think.
Oh, yeah.
Anybody?
Backseat Becky!
Gee, that, uh, that works for me.
I kind of like "Bubba".
Oh, God.
Then you probably know the whole sordid story.
Well, actually, no.
Well, that's because there isn't one.
Hey, hey, come on, come on.
Don't worry about that.
Listen, the truth is I'm looking to buy a new car, and I, uh, I need an expert opinion.
Uh now what-what what model do you think has the best rear shocks?
Have you driven a Ford lately?
I guess she gives new meaning to the term "four on the floor".
All right, all right.
If you insist on an explanation, I will give it to you.
You know how sometimes as a joke, you call someone the exact opposite of what they really are?
Well, I was really shy in college, so my friends thought it would be a huge gas to call me "Backseat Becky".
Well, it's simple, it's, it's logical, and we don't believe it for a second.
Wait a minute.
I-I believe her.
Us virgins have to stick together.
I told you the truth.
If you don't want to believe it, fine, just believe whatever you want.
All right, here's the real truth.
I was very aggressive in college, a real go-getter.
I never took a backseat to anyone.
No.
No, no.
No, Mr. Cronin, I'm not listening.
The case is closed.
I'm not taking any offers, and that's final.
I'm sorry if I've upset you, Mrs. Clavin.
Clifford, would you tell this gentleman, please, we're not selling our house?
I was just trying to make an offer on your house, and your mother won't listen.
Well, that's because she has got more sense in her bony little frame than you have in your little finger.
Reverse that.
You are not going to run the Clavins off our land.
I don't care what you offer us, you just can't put a price on love, family and our memories.
Take it or leave it-- $250,000.
$200 and Oh, my God, we're rich.
But Ma, Ma, you can't do this.
A Clavin cannot be bought off.
I'm only a Clavin by marriage, Clifford.
Oh Oh, guys, you gotta help me.
She's going to go through with this.
Well, why don't you offer to buy the place back?
Sammy, I don't have enough money for a down payment.
Wait a minute.
Can either of you guys lend me $50,000?
I'm sorry, Cliff, you never paid me back that million from last week.
Well, it's been a pleasure doing business with you, Mrs. Clavin.
Thank you.
Uh uh There!
There!
Now what are you going to do?
Well, first I'm going to take this contract down to the office, and then I'm going to call my wife and ask her what I'm supposed to pick up at the grocery store.
Ah, Ma, but after all we've been through together.
Just last night you were saying how much the house meant to you.
Last night I was poor.
Tonight I'm not.
I never thought I'd have the chance, but now I can go to Florida.
Florida?
Oh, for crying out loud.
Who'd ever want to live in that stinkhole?
Clifford, I'm doing this as much for you as I am for myself.
You're 39 years old.
It's time to cut the cord.
Ma, I am not leaving that house!
Clifford I am not leaving that house!
Well, I'm afraid you're going to have to.
Oh!
Oh, yeah, fine.
Go off by yourself.
See how you like it.
After a week of cooking your own meals, doing your own dishes, washing your own hair, you'll be back.
Oh, well, well, well, if it isn't the ultimate driving machine.
Okay, okay, I give up.
Look, I'll tell you the real story, but it's kind of personal so can we do this in private?
Sure, you bet.
You bet.
Say, if you're too embarrassed to say something, feel free to act it out.
I was living in a women's dorm on campus Mm-hmm.
and one night a fire broke out.
Ah.
Well, I didn't have time to change my clothes, so I had to run out to the parking lot wearing only a teddy; black, but see-through.
All of a sudden, I was caught in this fire engine's headlights.
I didn't know what to do.
I looked all around, and suddenly, I spotted this open convertible.
I climbed in, and I slunk down to the backseat.
Suddenly, this hulking fireman was standing over me.
He was magnificent.
I looked in his eyes.
I knew what he wanted, and I wanted it, too.
I peeled off his black rubber raincoat.
He ripped off my teddy.
I can still feel the heat on my flesh.
But it wasn't the fire-- it was us.
When it was over, I opened my eyes, and I noticed we weren't alone.
Others had watched and not said a word.
And that's why I'm known as "Backseat Becky".
Satisfied?
Thanks for the story, Carla.
Here's your ten bucks.
Yeah, the $20 one would have killed him.
So wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Why do they call you "Backseat Becky".
That will cost you a hundred.
Hey, you know, you're kind of a pig.
Maybe we can be friends.
Excuse me.
I've got to find Norm Peterson.
Does Mr. Peterson know what this is about?
Never mind.
There he is.
Norman.
Hi.
You got to help me.
I'm desperate.
What?
Cliff's locked himself in the house.
No, I've tried everything.
He won't budge.
Ours is the last house on the block scheduled for demolition, and that's today.
I'm at my wit's end.
You got to help me.
I'll talk to him.
I'll see what I can do.
Oh, thank you, Norm.
I hope he doesn't try anything crazy.
The last thing on Earth I want to see is my son's face on the 11:00 news.
There's a whole city out there that agrees with ya.
the world's biggest ass!
Clifford, now take off those silly handcuffs.
I can't.
I flushed the key.
Norman, go outside and see if you can find some tin snips.
Ask for Biff.
He loaned us the hard hats.
Clifford, sometimes I really worry about you.
Look what they did to Elmer.
I'm sorry, dear, but what can we do?
Come on, Ma, you're the one who taught me that if you believe in something, if you really want it, then you're just going to have to fight for it.
The house is sold.
They're going to tear it down.
Well, then I am going down with it.
Clifford, does this house really mean that much to you?
Yeah, Ma.
Yeah, it really does.
: Then it means that much to me, too.
I don't know what we'll do.
We'll find a lawyer.
We're going to fight this together.
We'll save our home.
Oh, Ma, together?
Really?
Really, son.
Oh!
What are you going to with that thing?
Cut your handcuffs off.
Yeah?
Well, that's a little bit dangerous!
What?
No, no.
I'm wearing a hard hat.
It's okay.
A hard hat?
Get that thing away from me!
Cut the post!
Isn't that a little drastic?
No, Ma, I think we're going to remodel in here anyway.
There.
I think we're going to beat this thing.
So do I. Now we're going to find a lawyer.
Okay.
But first, I want to treat you boys to a Popsicle!
: Oh, Ma.
What was that?
Ah, probably just a squirrel on the roof.
Big one.
Uh-oh!
Ma!
Imagine we got a quarter of a million for this dump.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
Woody, here's your dinner.
Oh, thanks, Carla.
Boy, I'm going to be glad when I drop this double load.
My veins are killing me.
Your veins, huh?
Yeah, varicose veins.
I had them stripped twice already.
How do they do that?
Surgically.
They cut a hole in your leg, and they pull the vein out.
No kidding?
Yeah, it's like pulling a long, slimy worm out of you flesh.
Gee, imagine that.
Can you believe maintaining that postcoital tristesse is gender oriented.
Do you mind, Dr. Crane?
I'm trying to eat.
Making your way in the world today Takes everything you've got Taking a break from all your worries Sure would help a lot Wouldn't you like to get away?
Sometimes you want to go Where everybody knows your name And they're always glad you came You want to be where you can see Our troubles are all the same You want to be where everybody knows your name You want to go where people know People are all the same You want to go where everybody knows your name.
Woody, does it look like we're going to get a good turnout for our auction?
Oh, yeah.
I'll bet by now there isn't anyone in Boston who doesn't know about it.
What auction?
We're having an auction?
It's terrific.
It's a benefit for Children's Hospital.
All these women get together and they bid for an evening on the town with eligible bachelors.
Local celebrities, athletes.
They raise a lot of money, they do it every year, and it's a great deal of fun.
Where'd you hear about it?
I must have been to one once.
Anyway, I told Mr. Drake Who'd you bid on?
I told Mr. Drake I thought it would be great publicity for Cheers.
Who'd you bid on?
And since it's for a good cause, he agreed Who'd you bid on?
A hairy linebacker.
Are you satisfied?
Ooh.
Oh!
Were you?
The point is, Mr. Drake thinks it's a great idea.
Woody So, Sammy, you going to be taking part in this auction?
Are you kidding me?
I hate that stuff.
It's one thing for guys to bid on chicks, but that's sick.
You know, as a matter of fact Here you go.
Excuse me.
Listen, I'm going to save you the embarrassment of asking and then being turned down.
I'm not going to be doing your auction.
So just forget it.
No way.
Not me.
Fine.
We need to create a stage.
I think right there as you walk in the door Hey, what's "fine" supposed to mean?
Well, it means I hadn't planned to ask you in the first place.
Oh, well, good, good.
'Cause I really don't care for that stuff.
All right.
We need a podium.
Because the emcee is going to be standing at the podium, and all the women will be standing around Excuse me, one more time here.
Why why hadn't you planned on asking me?
Well, I guess I just don't find you as irresistible as some do.
You, for instance.
But if you want to participate, you're perfectly welcome No, hey, forget it.
I'm sorry.
It doesn't matter to me either way.
I'm only doing this for charity.
You know, Vera has that carved on our headboard.
So we're agreed then, right?
Just plain simple gold wedding bands.
With an exquisite marquise diamond on mine so we can tell them apart.
You give me such glee.
Here we are.
Sit here, my betrothed.
I'll go get us something to drink, and, oh, uh, exchange a few lies with my buds.
I understand.
Your daily dose of male bonding.
Well, not for much longer.
You know what's are breaking up that old gang of mine.
As a guess, I'd say hypertension and cirrhosis.
You're irrepressible.
Sam, champagne, please.
Ah, guys.
Norm, Cliff.
Won't be long now before the boys of the bar are going to have to manage without me.
Can do.
Yeah, no sweat, Fras.
Champagne, huh?
Well, wild romance is a fictive term with no correlation to any actual physiological behavior.
We, nevertheless, like to humor convention by going through with these preposterous rituals.
Champagne, huh?
Hey, Frasier, can I ask you something?
When you and Lilith wake up in the morning, which one of you is the first to scream, "What have I done"?
Well, my darling, to us.
Thank you, darling.
It's been a lovely evening.
You've revealed previously unsuspected depths of romanticism.
Well, Lilith, we have a whole lifetime of romantic evenings ahead of us, but for now, we've got to plan.
We don't have much time.
We've got to get the wedding license, have blood tests, see the lawyer draw up the prenuptial agreement, invite the guests Excuse me.
What prenuptial agreement?
Well, wherein we decide what you are or are not entitled to in event of a divorce.
It's merely a safeguard.
You're already planning for the divorce?
Have you selected my cemetery plot also?
Well, assuming we stay together, you'll be right between me and Cousin Lemuel.
I cannot believe my ears.
This is your idea of romance?
Lilith, man does not live by romance alone.
He also needs hardheaded practicality.
If your head was any harder, it would etch glass.
Where are you going?
I have no intention of spending the rest of the evening, let alone the rest of my life, with a compulsive, anal retentive, chowderhead.
Now, Lilith, let's just both stop right now before we say something to spoil the mood.
Why don't you go make love to your accountant.
You know, if more people followed that advice, this world would be such a happier place.
You know, I just figured out what you're doing here.
You're using reverse psychology.
You really want me to be in that auction of yours, so you're pretending that you don't, am I right?
I don't care if you're in the auction.
I don't care if you're not in the auction.
Yeah, right.
I have never felt more honestly and passionately indifferent about anything in my life.
I really don't care.
All right, okay, you win.
I'm volunteering, all right?
I hear 200.
Three.
Okay, I have 300.
Anybody give me 350?
I want 350.
No.
Okay, Going once going twice Sold for $300!
Okay, okay, I'm going to let you gals take a breather while we get the next big hunk up here on the block.
Boy, oh boy, you can call me a traditionalist, call me out of step with the times, but I prefer to get my women the old-fashioned way.
In a plain brown wrapper?
Ah, women.
They can talk all they like about romance, but what it really comes down to is just pure animal lust.
Is that supposed to refer to me?
If the shoe fits.
Things a little strained between you two?
Oh, why should you ask that, Sam?
Just because she's a pigheaded witch?
!
So you two kids set a date yet?
This is great.
We're just $2,000 away from breaking the record.
How many guys do we have left?
Just Sammy.
Oh, well.
There's always next year.
$2,000?
Oh, gee, I might actually have to comb my hair.
Come on, you guys, there's no way he can get that by himself.
God, if we just had one more hunk.
All right, all right, all right.
Mr. Clavin, that is a really sweet gesture but, um isn't there some regulation against, uh government employees in uniform participating in this kind of a thing?
Oh, that is a very salient point, and one which I came within a hair of overlooking.
I thank you.
I shudder to think what might have happened.
We all do.
Woody.
Woody, what about you?
You're young, single, cute.
Come on, Woody, what do you say?
Oh, gosh, Miss Howe, I  Oh, come on.
Come on, buddy.
I don't know, I'm going to have to give this some very serious thought.
There isn't time.
That's okay.
I'm finished.
I'll do it.
Good!
All right, man.
Shucks.
I hope I'm not making a mistake.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
Being gawked at and herded around like a prized pig.
Gee, now that you put it like that.
Yeah, sounds great.
Now we have a little bonus for you ladies.
Please welcome our next eligible bachelor-- Mr. Woody Boyd!
Good evening, ladies.
I happen to be a very good chef, and your evening with me will be a wonderful home-cooked country meal with all the fixin's from my native land, Indiana.
And let me just mention my special ingredient-- pork.
And please remember, this is for charity.
Who'll start the bidding at 100?
$100.
Excuse me.
200.
I have 200.
Do I hear 250?
Uh, you know, I think pork might actually be out of season.
Three.
I have 300.
Do I hear 325?
I'm going to go out on a limb here, Cliffie, and say this is not her first time in a bar.
I have $325.
Do I hear 350?
Four.
I have 400.
Do I hear 450?
You can't do that.
Okay going twice Sold to the lady right over there.
How do you do?
You better be good.
Yes, ma'am.
Uh, will you excuse me a minute?
I have to do a couple things before we go.
Cute little gal there, Woody.
Is it me, or is she a little scary?
Woody, the electric chair is a little scary.
Hey, you know, um, Now Sam only has to reach 1,600 to break the record.
The day any woman pays 1,600 for Malone, I'll tattoo his name on my butt.
Sammy, quick, loan me 1,600 bucks.
And now, our grand finale.
Former Red Sox great Sam Malone!
Come on up here, Sam.
Yeah!
The big gun!
Whoo!
Thank you, thank you.
Ladies, let's see.
Your enchanted evening with me will begin with a leisurely sunset drive up to a small, secluded oceanside inn, where we will enjoy a candlelit, romantic dinner for two.
Yes, yes.
And then this being the beginning of the weekend, who knows where dinner will lead?
Well, okay.
Does anyone want to start the bidding at, uh, say, $100?
I meant $250.
$250!
I have 250.
I have $300.
Do I have $400?
We're rolling now!
I see you Do we hear $600?
Do I hear 650?
You were saying?
Okay, we have $600.
Come on, ladies, loosen those purse strings.
They stopped at $600.
Uh, no problem.
$650!
Carla, where are you going to get $650?
Don't need it.
See?
All you got to do is goose the bidding a little bit when it starts going down.
$900!
$900.
Now, do we have 950?
Come on, ladies-- hot stuff here!
I have 900.
Do I hear 950?
That's it; they're not going any higher.
No problem.
950!
Carla.
I hear 950.
$1,000!
I have $1,000!
You can keep 'em going all night.
$1,100!
We are rolling!
Do I have 1,250?
Oh, come on, now, ladies.
$1,250!
Well, well, well.
$1,300.
Do I hear $1,300?
That sly Rebecca, huh?
Quite a date you're passing up, here, ladies.
I said 1,250.
Do I hear 1,300?
Come on, now, ladies.
You heard the young lady.
Will anyone say 13?
Not me.
I'm out.
She wants him more than I do.
No, please, please Going twice Please.
going for the last time.
I bid $2,000.
Sold!
Yes, we broke the record, Mr. Drake.
Sam, all by himself, got $2,000.
Well, thank you very much.
Good-bye Mr. Drake.
Okay, well, here you go.
It's called Larry's Sanitary Tattoo.
Make sure you ask for Frank.
He likes to do it the old-fashioned way.
You'll scream a lot.
What do you think you're doing?
Helping charity.
Don't worry, it's just some money I had put aside to buy you a ring.
You are not actually going to go off with Sam to some inn on the Cape for the weekend?
Why not?
Did we have a prenuptial agreement to the contrary?
No, of course not.
Sam, I understand we're going to the Cape.
I'll just bring the car around.
We can stop at my place, and I'll throw some things in a bag.
Actually, Lilith, you know, that won't be necessary.
Perhaps not, but I believe in being prepared.
I hope you do, too.
Wha-ho!
Sammy, looks like you're going to get your lobster boiled.
Ah, no, I'm not.
She's just doing that to bug Frasier.
Well, you know, you could always trade with Woody.
I don't think her intentions are honorable.
Sam, Sam, I I-I've got to talk to you.
You can't go through with this.
Come on, man, she's just doing it to make you jealous.
Oh, God, I'm losing her, Sam.
Oh, would you stop that?
You're my friend.
I'm never going to take a woman away from you.
What about Diane?
And didn't God punish me with a vengeance?
Well, yes, but gee whiz, Sam Oh, come on.
Listen, wait a minute.
There's got to be You know, I'll tell you what.
You know, this ought to be a chance for me to bring the two of you together again.
What do you mean?
Well, all right, l-listen.
I'll pretend to go along with the date, right?
I'll rent the room, I'll get some wine, and then I'll tell her how great you are, and then pow, you burst in on us.
I do?
Yeah.
Yeah, why not?
I mean, you followed us up there.
It'll prove how crazy you are about her.
She'll be putty in your hands.
Well, it has a certain panache.
Yeah, here you go.
Here's the address.
Now, uh, be up there by 9:00, and, uh, just throw me out of there, man.
Show me no mercy.
By God, I'll send you packing!
All right.
Ready to go, Sam?
Yes, yes, you bet, yes, sirree.
Coming.
I'm eager to get somewhere we can be alone.
Oh, not half as eager as I am.
My God, look at that, Cliffie, will you?
She's smoked about eight packs of cigarettes.
Where does all the smoke go?
I'm waiting to see where it comes out.
You guys got any last-minute advice for me?
Yeah, leave a trail of bread crumbs.
A little more bubbly here?
Whatever you suggest, Sam.
I'm agreeable to anything you suggest.
Ah, well, good, good, good, because, um, quite frankly, I'd like to talk just a little bit more about Frasier.
You know, uh, one of the, uh, qualities that I admire most about him is his reliability.
He's always very punctual, isn't he?
Frasier, Schmasier.
Let's have some fun.
Heck of a guy, Frasier, I'll tell you.
A lot of, uh, remarkable qualities   Uh you know, he's, uh, he's faithful, he-he's devoted  And he's, uh, musical, too.
Very musical guy, you know?
He's always, uh, whistling something or singing some tune.
Or making that that funny little chirping noise he makes with his lips.
What are you doing?
It's too bright.
Talk about bright.
I tell you, uh Frasier's just about the brightest guy I've ever met.
You don't mind if we turn some of these back on, do you, in case we want to read later, or something?
Hey, you know, Frasier reads a lot, doesn't he?
Sam, we've talked enough about Frasier.
Let's talk about you.
Oh, me, well, I'm just a an ordinary guy who happens to respect and admire the hell out of Frasier, I'll tell you.
Smell good?
You bet; I sniff him every time he comes in the bar.
Listen to that music.
Makes me want to do uninhibited things.
Well, you know, that just about wraps up our date here.
Uh, I hope you don't feel ripped off, or anything, but I think we ought to be getting back.
What's your hurry, sailor?
Well, I just thought that, uh All right, good, good, good.
Yeah, check around the bed and make sure you haven't left anything there.
Uh, then, uh, you know, to tell you the truth, it's getting kind of late.
I'd like to, uh, I'd like to drive back.
What are you, uh?
: That's very funny.
Lilith, may I, may I have my keys, please?
Lilith, stop it; I'm serious.
Lilith, I want my Lilith, I-I don't I'm very serious, now.
Listen to the tone of my voice.
Give me my car keys.
Oh, don't Why do you want to go back?
We have such a nice room here.
Nice?
I wouldn't let a dog sleep here.
Maybe the curtains aren't that bad.
Feel that music, Sam.
Lift me down.
Oh, all right.
Oh!
Oh!
Dance with me.
Uh, I don't think that's such a good idea.
Well, maybe just a little bit.
Do you know what I always have the urge to do whenever I see you, Sam?
Uh, please don't tell me.
Unbutton your shirt.
: Oh, oh, well Uh, boy, they didn't, uh, set the clocks back and forget to tell me, did they?
Did you read Lady Chatterley's Lover?
Uh, Lady Chatterley's Lover?
Uh, yes, as a matter of fact, I did read that.
Or parts of it, at least.
I have the strangest desire to twine flowers in your chest hair,  then deflower you.
Listen, Lilith, uh Mmm.
Mmm.
Oh, boy.
Mmm Aha!
I found you kissing!
Got her all warmed up for you, there, Fras.
And yourself in the process, I see.
Oh, come on.
Well, let's just step outside, settle this like gentlemen.
Oh, don't be ridiculous, man.
At least do me the honor of pulling up your pants.
All right, I will.
All right.
Now, what is going on here?
I might ask you the same.
Look, I'll ask the questions around here!
Would you two stop sniping, for goodness sake?
Do you have any idea how ridiculous you look?
You two were actually going to Oh, of course not.
That was only for your sake.
What?
You mean you knew I was coming?
Frasier, darling, yin to my yang, I know your mind as I know my own.
Of course I knew you'd come.
I knew you could do no other.
Besides, I could hear your muffler behind us all the way up Route 3.
And what a joke on me.
What a cruel, wonderful joke on me.
Why, Lilith, why?
Because I was angry about that prenuptial agreement.
Oh.
And hurt.
Look, I'm-I'm sorry I ever brought that up in the first place.
It's just that I've seen so many failed marriages.
I just wanted some insurance, I guess.
Of course, I I forgot I'm marrying the perfect woman.
Don't forget that, Frasier.
And I certainly didn't mean to hurt you with Sam.
By the way, what took you so long getting here?
Oh, well, when I first arrived, I went to the wrong room.
Uh By the way, we're having breakfast tomorrow with Jack and Peggy in number eight.
I'm paying.
Frasier, you dear, sweet ninny.
I do love you, you know.
And I, you.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
Whoo!
Sorry I'm late.
Boy, you will not believe what happened to me.
I made a right-hand turn onto Boyleston and ran right into this stupid parade.
Then my car backfired, and scared the tar out of these two cute little poodles in tutus who were dancing by.
Dancing poodles.
Yeah.
Anyway, the dogs spooked and ran away, and this cute little girl in blue sequins ran after them right in front of this little car full of clowns that swerved to miss her, and the car ran right in front of this elephant, the elephant reared up, threw this swami guy off that was riding on his tusk.
Sam, this is the lamest excuse you have ever given me.
Why don't you just say, "I'm sorry, Rebecca, I overslept.
It won't happen again"?
It really makes me I'm sorry, Rebecca, I just overslept.
It won't happen again.
Making your way in the world today Takes everything you've got Taking a break from all your worries Sure would help a lot Wouldn't you like to get away?
Sometimes you want to go Where everybody knows your name And they're always glad you came You want to be where you can see Our troubles are all the same You want to be where everybody knows your name You want to go where people know People are all the same You want to go where everybody knows your name.
Frasier, I'm double-parked outside.
Finish your drink and let's go.
Oh, in a minute; I just touched my glass.
Don't balk, jelly bear.
I'm not balking, moon pie.
I'm simply trying to finish my drink.
You'd understand if you had as trying a day as I've had.
The kind of day you've had?
Lord, if I hear one more yuppie snivel about his inability to love, I'll smack him.
Boo, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.
I saw nine clients today with no lunch.
I saw ten.
multiple personalities.
Oh, yeah, well, you Come on, please.
You're a little tense; you got to relax, take a few days off.
You know, maybe a vacation, or something?
Vacation?
Ha!
You make it sound so easy, Sam.
As if one could just pick up just like that.
We are professionals, with commitments and obligations.
Our patients depend upon us.
I'll clear my schedule if you will.
Nassau or St. Thomas?
Let's go talk to the travel agent.
There you go.
Have a good time.
Has anybody seen Woody?
He was scheduled to be here at 6:00.
He's going to be late.
Good God, people.
I don't even know why I bother to prepare a work schedule.
Everybody just comes and goes as they damn well please.
Yeah, he, uh, he did send these, though.
"I'm sorry I'm late.
Please dock my pay".
Now, this is the way to be late.
Where is the little  anyway?
I don't know.
Oh, no, Sam.
I've been a mother for 18 years.
When someone says "I don't know" like that, they know.
Cough it up, or I'm going to get it out of you another way.
I don't know; I'm telling you the tru Oh, a-a-all right, all right, all right, all right.
Uh, he's auditioning for a play.
A play?
Yeah.
Hicky McHick from Hicksville wants to act?
He's been hanging out at this little local playhouse and, you know, doing all the odds and ends.
Sweeping, cleaning toilets-- everything no one else wants to do.
I wonder if Woody'd like to act over at my house?
Yeah.
Uh, hey, wait, here he comes.
He's very sensitive about this.
Don't say anything about his acting.
Hey, everybody.
Hey, Woody.
If I knew you wanted a "role" so badly, I would have stopped at the bakery.
Sam!
I'm sorry.
But how'd the audition go?
Great.
Said my lines faster than anyone else.
Yeah, Woodman, when did you get bit by the old acting bug?
Oh, back in high school in Hanover.
I was in the chorus of the senior class production of Hello, Donald.
Isn't that isn't that Hello, Dolly?
Oh, no, no-- they had to change the name.
Donald Wexler was the only guy who could sing the part.
So, what's this, uh, play you tried out for?
Well, it's a brand-new one.
It's called Authors in Hell.
I'm hoping to play either Mark Twain, one of the guys from the Algonquin Round Table or Satan.
But heck, I'd be just as happy playing a fire- breathing incubus.
They get to stay onstage the whole four hours.
Hey, hey, that's my director, Grif Palmer.
This must mean I got the part.
Or that he's thirsty.
Hi, Mr. Palmer.
Can I get you a drink?
No, thanks.
I got the part!
Woody, you're a multitalented young man.
I didn't get the part?
Well, you know, I've tried out so many times, and I've never gotten a part.
Maybe I'm just wasting my time in the theater.
Come on, Woody, don't give up so easily.
Once upon a time, there was a young man named Grif Palmer who also auditioned for many a role that he didn't get.
As many as me?
Well, no.
Wait, wait, I've got a thought.
What would you say if I told you I've selected a fresh, new face to understudy the role of Mark Twain?
I think you'll be hearing his name quite a bit from now on Mr. Woody Boyd.
Hey, that's me!
Hey, everybody, I'm going to be an understudy!
Hey, all right.
All right, Wood.
That's good.
Woody, this isn't going to interfere with your job, is it?
Gee, I don't think so.
Well yeah.
I'm sorry, Woody, I need you here nights.
Miss Howe, this is my golden chance.
I have to do this.
Don't you understand, I just gotta do it!
I just gotta!
That was really good, man.
Can I talk to you just a second here?
Let him do it.
I would love to, but I need him here.
Well, he'll be here.
You saw that performance.
They're not going to let him go on.
Break a leg, Woody.
All right!
Welcome to the theater, Woody.
To the ranks of the Lunts and the Oliviers.
To a profession rife with style, with history, with dignity.
To a calling I only hope will bring you as much joy as it has brought me.
Hi.
Hello.
You know Grif Palmer?
Yeah.
He's the janitor at my kids' school.
: Hello, good-mannered and agreeable children.
Hey, everybody, look who's here.
It's that famous actor Robert De Zero.
Uh, Carla, it's me, Woody.
Woody, you have been coming in here dressed in that ridiculous getup for three weeks.
Now, when are you going to stop this nonsense?
Carla, as an understudy, I have to be dressed and ready to go on at a moment's notice.
Putting on makeup like this can take hours.
But I wouldn't expect you to understand.
Why, 'cause I'm not in the theater?
No, because you don't wear makeup.
Huckleberry alert.
Hey, Mark Twit!
Woody, would you run upstairs and get some change?
Ones and fives.
New bills if they've got them.
: "Uh, let us not be too particular.
"It is better to have old secondhand diamonds than none at all".
Do you think you could manage it without any quotes?
"I could do it as easy as falling off a log".
Woody, just do it!
"When angry, count four.
When very angry, swear".
Damn it!
There you go.
Sam, run upstairs and get me some change.
Aw, come on, that's a junior bartender's job.
You are the junior bartender.
Oh, right.
Yeah.
Yeah, but I'm-I'm working my way up, you know?
Pretty soon, I might even own my own bar.
Good evening, ma'am.
Oh, hello, there.
Oh, thank you.
I'm blind as a bat without glasses.
I've never seen a bat with glasses.
That's funny.
: Yeah, I can imagine.
I believe it might rain soon.
: "One of the brightest gems of the New England weather is the dazzling uncertainty of it".
: Well, what can you do?
"Everybody talks about the weather, but no one ever does anything about it".
Uh, may I have a glass of white wine, please?
Wine.
White wine.
Uh let's see, now.
They have a lot of wine in San Francisco, don't they?
Oh, I suppose they do.
"One of the coldest winters I ever spent was summer in San Francisco".
Sorry, that's as close as I could get.
You're rather amusing.
Well, thanks.
But I've been quoting Mark Twain.
I know; I think that's amusing.
And, uh, I suppose that you've been told that you look something like him.
Yeah, I get that a lot.
You know, you look a little bit like Emily Dickinson.
She's one of the authors in hell.
Oh, that's an unkind assumption, sir.
Although she's never been one of my favorites, either.
Here's your change.
And, oh, yeah, a little something for you here.
What is it?
One of the shrimps from up at the buffet table.
Ew!
You're lucky.
My first choice was an oyster.
So was mine, but I hired you.
I haven't seen you in here before, have I?
Uh, no, I don't get around much since my husband, Lloyd, passed away.
We used to come by here every evening during our walk, but, uh, Lloyd never let us come in.
He got jealous when I was around other men.
I can see why.
Oh, for heaven's sakes.
Oh, I think you're blushing.
Oh, it's the wine.
Although as Mark Twain said, "Man is the only animal that blushes".
"Or needs to".
All aboard the S.S. Delmonico.
Embarking at 0900 hours for Nassau, St. Thomas, Martinique, and other exotic ports of call.
So you took my advice, huh?
Yes.
As of close of business today, it's just us.
A couple of fun-loving swabbies lost at sea.
We'll be todo incomunicado.
No business, no clients, no phone call  Lilith, we promised no beepers.
I won't give it up without a fight.
You'll have to perform a strip search.
The vacation has begun.
Now hear this.
Hear this, Sternin.
Prepare to be boarded.
Folks, I have a bit of bad news that may affect a lot of you.
I'm not going to beat around the bush, I'm just going to come right out and say it.
Last call.
Well, what the heck, maybe I'll give Vera a thrill and go home a little early tonight.
Although, you know, she did look kind of thrilled when I left.
Excuse me, Mary, uh listen, I'll be back in a second, and then then I'll see you home.
Oh, that's all right.
But thank you.
I've had a wonderful evening.
Well, I have, too.
I really enjoyed your company.
You're a very nice lady.
And you're a lovely gentleman.
And may I add, you have the most glorious head of hair I've seen on any man since my Lloyd died.
Gee, I hate to disappoint you, but this is a wig.
Yes.
So was Lloyd's.
Um, pardon me, ma'am, uh, but that adorable bartender over there.
Woody?
Uh, yes.
Is he keeping company with anyone in particular?
Not that I know of.
Well, I think he's very special.
Well, I guess that's the nicest way of putting it.
Good night.
Night.
Oh, Woods.
You know that dust in a dress you've been yakking with?
Mary?
You didn't, by any chance, happen to tell her that you're wearing old man makeup for a play, did you?
That sort of thing is pretty hard to work into polite conversation.
With your makeup, and the lighting in here, and those Mr. Magoo glasses of hers-- I think she got the wrong idea.
She's got the hots for you.
Carla, you're crazy.
She's just a sad old woman who needed someone to talk to.
You of all people should understand that.
There's no way she's gonna go for me.
I mean, in order for her to fall in love with me, I'd have to be the best darn actor in Boston.
Oh, no, I'm the best darn actor in Boston.
: Hello, mon.
I'm sorry, uh, Limbo Night's Tuesday, man.
Hey, mon, you stop bad mouth styling, or I'm gonna have to bop you on the head with a banana boat, mon.
Frasier, please cut the calypso.
Isn't it enough the cabdriver already took a swing at you?
You guys look like you had a good time.
We had oodles of fun.
And we lost a combined Wait, you lost weight on a cruise?
I heard there were wall-to-wall meals.
There were also wall-to-wall waves.
Yes.
Well, fortunately, after three days of giving Chef Hugo's fine cuisine back to the sea, we were fitted with these little, uh, ear patches.
They seemed to do the trick.
And put us to sleep for the rest of the trip.
So you guys spent seven days and nights snoozing and barfing your way through the Caribbean?
And we've never felt slimmer and more refreshed.
Well, what say we go get some lunch there, my little marine melon?
Anything you want.
Just promise me you won't refer to the waitress as "Sista".
Day-o Day-ay-ay-o Daylight come, and me wanna home.
You're not the only one.
Oh, hey, Woody.
I thought your, uh, play closed.
It did, last night.
Oh, so, uh what's with the old geezer drag?
I was with Mary.
Another date, huh?
It wasn't a date.
I just took her to lunch, then a movie, and then dancing.
Hey, Woody, Woody, Woody, Woody.
Man, this is crazy.
You, you know, you've been out with Mary every night this week.
You can't spend your life dressed up like Mark Twain.
Why not?
He did.
Oh, Sam, I I don't know what to do.
I've tried to tell her, but every time I do, she just stares at me with those big lonely eyes.
I mean, who'd have thought that my God-given acting talent was gonna turn out to be a curse?
Are we voting?
You got to nip this in the bud.
Yeah, I agree there, Woody.
A young, such as yourself, to be spending so much time with an older woman is eh, it's just unnatural.
Yeah, well, how about you, Cliff?
You spend lots of time with your mother, and she's old.
My ma's not old, and she's never gonna die before I do, so just shut up, okay?
!
Hey, hey, Woods.
Mary just came in.
Maybe you should get her a glass or something.
She doesn't drink in the afternoon.
No, I mean to put her teeth in.
Hi, Mary.
Hi.
What are you doing here?
I just wanted to see you again.
Yeah.
Look, can we sit down?
I'd like to talk with you a second.
All right.
Listen, I I know how lonely you've been since Lloyd passed away.
Oh, how lonely I was.
I'm not anymore.
You know, : loneliness is highly underrated.
It's one of the few things left that you can still do alone.
Did Mark Twain say that?
No, but I'm kind of running out of his material.
There's something I want to give you.
It's Lloyd's watch.
Oh.
I want you to have it.
No, I couldn't.
Oh, please.
Ah, gee, thanks, Mary.
Would you excuse me for a second?
Sure.
Oh, wait.
I just want to memorize the way you look in this light.
: Go ahead.
Sam, I don't know what to do.
Now she's memorizing the way I look in different kinds of light.
Oh, I don't know, Woody.
Women do that all the time.
Yeah, and she gave me her dead husband's watch.
You could do a lot worse.
Listen, you got to end this.
Right now, go on.
I don't know how.
You know, I-I can't stand the thought of hurting somebody's feelings.
I know.
Carla, you've been dumped a million times.
What's the best way to do it?
You know, the only reason I'm not cleaning your clock is because you remind me of Jed Clampett.
Listen, you are not dumping her.
You're leveling with her.
Now, it's-it's the only honest thing to do.
Now, go on, be a man.
Do it.
You're right, Sam.
It's time I stood on my own two feet and did what's right.
Right.
Will you come with me?
This is something you got to do by yourself.
I can't.
Well, I-I'm not gonna do it, Woody.
: Please, Sam, I can't do this by myself.
You've got to help me.
All right, all right.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Thank you.
You believe I'm just an understudy?
Um, Mary, Yes.
Woody wants to tell you something.
Well, um Mary, you see Uh I mean, you know, uh, how I don't suppose there's any chance you understand what I'm talking about yet.
Actually, I do.
Let me explain something to you, Woody.
I'm a very lonely woman since I lost my husband.
My family lives out of state.
I never see my grandchildren, and most of my friends have moved or passed away.
Seems my days are so hard to fill.
I swear, there are mornings when it didn't seem worthwhile getting out of bed.
A-And then I met you Stop.
Stop.
Will you marry me?
Heavens, no.
I'm three times your age.
You know that I'm young?
Well, Woody, I may be old, but I'm not stupid.
Well, why didn't you ever tell me this?
Well, I enjoyed your company so.
And besides, every time I wanted to, you started quoting "The Jumping Frog of Calaveras County" Now, I hope you're not upset with me.
Oh, are you kidding?
I'm just glad I didn't have to dump you.
And besides, you had such fun playing the part, and you were quite excellent.
You sure you don't want to marry me?
: Ah, no, Woody.
Well, will you be my grandma?
Uh, well, maybe a favorite aunt.
It's a deal.
My birthday is July 23rd.
I just gave you the watch.
By the way, we're still on for pot roast on Saturday.
Leave the wig at home.
Bye-bye.
Bye.
Well, I guess in a really weird way, it kind of worked out, didn't it?
Huh?
Yeah.
I'm still a little depressed.
Why?
Well, I mean, Mary knows I'm a good actor, but now that Authors in Hell is closed, I'm not gonna get to show the rest of the world.
Oh, yeah.
You know what, I got an idea.
Why don't you do it right here?
Hop right up there, and show the show the whole bar.
: I don't know.
All right.
Gather 'round, everybody.
I'm going to do Authors in Hell.
I mean, if that's all right with you, Miss Howe.
Well, I was planning to wait for the movie, but go ahead.
Imagine if you will a huge book opens up, and I-- Mark Twain-- step out.
I am surrounded by various tormented American writers.
And Satan.
The lights dim.
: Persons attempting to find a motive in this narrative will be prosecuted.
Persons attempting to find a moral in it will be banished.
Persons attempting to find a plot in it will be shot.
Woody, go on.
Well, I just sit here and smoke.
I don't talk again till the middle of act four.

How long's it been?
Well, two to ten, with time off for good behavior.

You need change.
Maybe I can help you, huh?
Great.
Hold it, hold it.
Oh, come on, guys.
Give me a break.
I'm a reformed man.
Oh, yeah?
Well, maybe you wouldn't mind if we monitored this little transaction.
Yeah.
Wouldn't mind at all.
Okay, you got 50 bucks.
Here's one, two, three, four, five.
Norm, what time is it?
Gee, my watch must be fast.

Wait.
You can't be that old.
When were you born?
'47.
There you go, barkeep.
Thank you.
Good to see you, guys.
Yeah.
Hey, Sam, long time no see.
What was Harry the Hat doing here?
He just came in for a beer.
Oh.
And some change.
Oh   Making your way in the world today Takes everything you've got Taking a break from all your worries Sure would help a lot Wouldn't you like to get away?
Sometimes you want to go Where everybody knows your name And they're always glad you came You want to be where you can see Our troubles are all the same You want to be where everybody knows your name You want to go where people know People are all the same You want to go where everybody knows your name.
Afternoon, everybody.
Norm.
How's life treating you?
It's not, Sammy, but that doesn't mean you can't.
Uh, boy, I'd love to, man, but I don't have a dime to my name.
And my boat sank and everything Yeah, I know-- the bottom of the Caribbean.
What is that, the 17th or 18th time we heard that speech?
Oh, hey, Normie?
Listen, that was great meat loaf last night, huh?
It was, wasn't it?
You know, uh, Cliff, I've been meaning to talk to you.
Hmm?
I don't mind you staying with us for a little while till you get your new place, but, uh, it's beginning to be a little bit of a problem for Vera.
The dishes, the bed, the way you leave the bathroom in the morning.
: You got to start leaving something for her to do, pal.
I mean, she wants to spend time with me.
Booze, Woody, and quickly.
What's the matter, Dr. Crane?
Oh, I'm devastated.
I need something expeditious and brutal to numb my sensibilities and blast me into sweet oblivion.
How about a boilermaker?
Make it a mimosa.
What's got you so upset?
Some college professor has just published an article that refutes everything I said in my last paper.
Sounds like a shoot-out at the cuckoo corral.
What could motivate an honored and distinguished colleague to launch a personal attack like this?
Well, now, maybe it's just a, you know, honest difference of opinion between scholars.
Oh, goose poop, Sam, the man's a yahoo.
Hey, Sammy?
Mm-hmm.
You want to see what makes Rebecca's loins ache?
Sure.
Well, he just walked in.
It's the great and powerful Evan Drake.
See to my table upstairs.
Uh, yes, sir.
She's skipping the thrill ride that's Sammy Land for that?
While I think of it, take care of that telex to Paris.
First thing tomorrow.
Now.
Uh, yes, sir.
What's she see in him?
Money, power, prestige.
Yeah, but I'm several inches taller than him.
Sam Malone.
Evan Drake.
How do you do?
I've been looking forward to meeting you.
I was a big fan of yours.
Oh.
Any fan of mine is certainly welcome here, especially one who could fire me like a shot.
What can I get you?
You got some 20-year-old Scotch?
Uh, no, but we got some pretzels that have been around for a while here.
How about a Dewar's, huh?
That'll do it.
So, Mr. Drake, things are going pretty good at the old bar.
Well, I'm glad to hear that.
We sank a lot of bucks into it.
Oh, boy, don't talk to me about sinking, man.
I lost my boat and Yeah, I heard.
Oh.
I remember watching you pitch, Sam.
I'll bet you got a lot of great stories, huh?
Well, yeah.
I got a million of 'em.
Hold still, I'll be right there.
Mr. Drake, they're ready for you upstairs now.
I'll tell them to wait.
You know how people are always catching you naked when you don't want them to?
Well, this time Can you settle an argument here?
How much you figure a guy like that pays for his socks?
I don't want to talk to anybody I've seen those at Barney's.
They're about  Even I pay a dollar for mine.
The next thing I know, there's a guys standing next to me So there I am in the locker room signing the game ball for this guy, buck naked.
I tell you, I'll never forget his name, because it was so unusual.
Ueberroth.
Peter Ueberroth-- the Baseball Commissioner?
Uh, that's where the story kind of falls apart.
I'll be right back.
Where you been?
I had to change a flat.
Mr. Drake's here.
Carla, don't even think of joking about that.
Hello, Mr. Drake.
Oh, my God.
I didn't know you'd be here.
I look messy.
Close your eyes.
Not you, Woody.
An attractive woman.
A little jumpy, though.
Yeah, but she makes it work somehow, doesn't she?
You know, some of the guys down at corporate have asked her out, but she always shot them down.
You tried your luck with her yet?
Oh, no.
I have a rule about not dating people I work with.
Struck out, huh?
Every time.
Yeah, you know, some of the guys there in the office think she's a What?
a lady's lady.
Rebec?
Oh, no.
Oh, I can't believe it.
I'm so sorry, Mr. Drake.
I would have been here sooner, but I was working on my car.
Uh well, I got a lunch partner.
Well, you know it was really nice to see you again.
Even if it was just for a short while.
Oh, by the way, I'm hosting a little party Friday night for some of the key people.
I would love it if you could come.
Oh, Mr. Drake, I'd-I'd-I'd-I'd really love that.
That's great.
black tie.
Yeah, here's the address.
And bring a date.
Uh, or a companion, or whatever.
Sam.
I wonder what he meant by "a companion or a whatever".
Who knows?
What's so funny?
Uh, well, it seems that the love of your life there thinks that because he's never seen you date anybody that maybe you well, prefer ladies.
You-you set him straight, didn't you?
Based on what?
God, I I can't believe this.
He's all I ever think about, and now he thinks that I'm Yeah, yeah, it's a nutty world, isn't it?
You know something, though-- I'm bet you could change his mind real quick if you were to show up at his party just crawling all over this incredibly good-looking, hot, macho stud.
You for instance?
You recognized the description.
Look, Sam, just because I put my work before my social life, does not mean I don't have boyfriends.
I have boyfriends.
I could pick up that phone and have a dozen dates for Friday night.
Yeah, but could you get one as great looking as I am?
Blindfolded, gagged and with both hands tied behind my back.
We were just talking about a party Friday night.
Sammy, where is it, and what time should I be there?
Good evening, Sam.
Hey.
Can I, uh, get a glass of water.
Got the hiccups, huh?
Yes.
It's merely psychosomatic.
I guess I'm still upset about that journalistic stab in the back.
You ought to put a bag over your head.
No, no.
I'd look ridiculous.
I'm just going to do what my mother always taught me.
Oh, yeah, you're right, the bag would look silly.
There.
Hey.
Oh, damn.
Wow, Miss Howe.
You look pretty enough to take to a barn dance.
Thank you.
Sam, when I'm gone tonight, I want Why are you wearing a tuxedo?
Why does Superman wear a cape?
To rescue people.
This is your big party night, isn't it?
Yes.
He did tell you to invite somebody, didn't he?
Yes, and I did-- an old boyfriend Ryan.
Oh, really?
Yes, and it wasn't an easy decision.
Yeah, I'll bet not.
I thought about asking Steve, but he had a modeling gig in New York.
And then Jean Pierre is such a bore.
Keep humming, though.
Keep humming.
Keep it up.
Keep humming.
come on.
I think it worked.
Frasier, I'm telling you, you should put a bag on your head.
Carla, I'm not putting any  bag on my head.
Oh, give me the damn bag.
You know what else I found works, is putting a lemon in your mouth.
Wait a minute, you can actually get a whole lemon in your mouth?
Well, young man, let's take a trip over to Mr. Wizard's laboratory.
Yeah?
Woody What's this message, "Urgent.
See Woody"?
Oh, right.
Uh, Ryan from the escort service called, said there a mistake in the booking.
He couldn't make it tonight.
Said to be discrete about it.
That's why I wrote the note that way.
Sweetheart, can you help me with my cufflinks?
Sam, you are not going with me.
No way.
An escort service?
You couldn't get a date from an escort service?
I am not going with you.
There are a lot of people that hang out here that I'd rather be seen with.
Dr. Crane would probably enjoy a stylish evening with refined company.
I'm cured.
I think I'm cured.
I think I'm cured!
Just remember now, I don't go all the way on the first date.
Do you think that's her?
This is ridiculous.
Listen, uh, why don't you let me freshen your drink up there, and I'll find out if that's his wife.
I'm not even thirsty.
Don't be obvious.
Uh, do that again there, will you, partner?
Nice party.
Ah, glad you like it.
Yeah, yeah.
I guess I was way off base about Rebecca, wasn't I?
Oh, yeah, way off, way off.
On the way over in the car, she was all over me like a cat in heat.
Interesting.
Say, uh, I haven't met your wife here.
Oh, no, that's not her.
Uh, she's in Bora Bora.
Oh, uh, visiting family?
Actually, we're, uh, we're separated, Sam.
Oh, oh, well, that's too bad, 'cause she's missing a heck of a party here.
Well, thanks a lot.
Well?
She's in Bora Bora.
They're separated.
I knew it.
I knew it, I knew it.
You know, I gotta tell you, I'm a little bit confused here.
The red sauce is for the shrimp, and the mustard's for the egg roll.
That's not what I meant.
But thanks.
No, I was just wondering why haven't you made a play for this guy?
I mean, how long have you been carrying a torch?
It's not a torch.
What a silly expression.
I am not carrying a torch.
All right.
Two years.
Two years?
You haven't dated?
You haven't done anything with anybody for two years?
My God, what happens to a person's body?
You haven't given him a clue?
You didn't how you feel or anything?
Oh, sweetheart.
You got to tell him tonight before you explode or something.
I can't.
I wouldn't know what to say.
Well, hell, I'll tell you what.
Let's rehearse it right here, just the two of us.
You really think that'll work?
Absolutely-- just pretend that I'm Mr. Drake here, and you've finally gotten me alone and you're going to tell me.
Okay.
Okay.
Mr. Drake No Evan.
Evan No, no.
With feeling.
Evan.
Yeah, that's good, that's good.
Now, uh, run your hand up my thigh, here.
Wait a minute No, no, trust me.
Guys think that's charming.
I just want to leave.
No.
Hey, listen.
You're never gonna find a better time than this.
I mean, he just separated with his wife, he's here alone, we're at a party, you look terrific.
Now, call me crazy, but this could be the perfect moment.
You're right.
Yeah.
I have to seize the moment.
There you go.
Good girl.
Mr. Drake?
Yes, Rebecca?
Take me.
What the hell are you doing?
I'm sorry.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Sam, I think she needs to go home.
No, I don't need to go home.
Good night.
I'm humiliated.
I know.
Come on.
And disgraced.
I'm going to kill myself.
I still think that thigh thing would have been charming.
Cheers.
Oh, hi, Mrs. Peterson.
Yeah, just a minute.
Hello.
Hi, Vera.
Whoa.
That's great news.
Great.
Cliffie.
Here, she wants to talk to you.
Me?
Huh.
So, uh, what's the good news?
That she wants to talk to you.
Yeah, Vera.
Oh?
Well, uh, uh, you following the recipe exactly?
Oh, gee, no, Vera, look.
It's supposed to be two cups of water, not vinegar.
No, uh, get ahold of yourself, now, Vera.
Y-y-you're making a cake, not building a bomb.
He obviously hasn't had her tuna casserole.
Hello, young lovers Wherever you are I hope your troubles are few   Stupid.
Hey, Woody.
Where is Rebecca?
Uh, she was just playing the jukebox then she went into the office.
Thank you.
Yeah.
I'll be right over.
Oh, I gotta get over there, Normie.
She's-she's up to her armpits in batter.
You don't mind if I stay, Cliff.
I've already seen that.
Yeah.
Don't blame me.
I told you to talk to the guy, not inhale his gum.
I couldn't help myself.
Yeah, well, at least you know how he feels now-- he's not interested.
Who wanted to know that?
You did.
You were miserable not knowing.
I was happy being miserable.
Now you've ruined it.
Oh, listen.
Now, just Come on, sit down here, will you?
Relax, please.
Just, you know, just Could I have this?
I'm probably gonna lose my job.
Oh, right.
Sure.
He's gonna come over here and fire you because of one lousy kiss.
Talk about paranoid.
Miss Howe.
Mr. Drake's here to see you.
Talk about coincidence.
I'm dead.
No, you're not.
Now, I'll take care of this.
Uh Woody, can you stall for a minute there?
Sure.
You know, in high school, I entered the 4-H Club Not us, Woody-- him, him.
Not us, him.
Out there, boy.
Come on.
Okay?
Sure, Sam.
Would it have killed you to be a little more specific?
What am I going to do?
Well, just wait.
Uh Well, all right, I'll-I'll go out there and I'll tell him, uh, that you were bombed and that it didn't mean anything.
Terrific.
Wonderful image.
A girl goes to a party and gets hammered, then turns promiscuous.
Well, all right, all right, uh I'll-I'll tell him that, uh, that you were trying to make me jealous 'cause you're crazy in love with me.
That's Let me see.
My choices are I'm a boozy slut or a complete idiot.
I'd go with the idiot.
I already did.
So, that's how we knew, beyond a doubt, that we were putting way, way too much bran in the pig's fodder.
Hi, Evan.
Oh, Sam What are you doing here, huh?
Well, I was on my way to the airport, and I thought I'd come by here and clear this matter up before I left.
Oh, yeah, listen, I gotta tell you, that whole thing at the party was my fault.
I mean, we had had a little tiff, and she was trying to make me jealous.
Yeah, I figured it was something like that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, I better go back there and apologize to her.
Wait, wa You're going to apologize?
Well, yeah, I overreacted.
I was a little rough on her.
Oh.
Yeah.
Uh, actually, uh, give me a second here, will you?
Um She probably needs to freshen up.
She's pretty upset by this whole thing.
Her mascara's probably down in her shoes by now.
How much do I owe you for that, bartender?
Oh, no charge, Mr. Drake.
I mean, after all, you kind of own the place.
Oh, no, no, no, no, I'll pay for it.
Credit card okay?
Sure.
All right.
I'll need to see a driver's license.
Listen, I did my best.
I mean, I gave him the jealousy story, but he just didn't buy it.
I tell you, man, he is really steamed.
Damn.
You know, he said that if, uh, if you were really in love with me, that he might understand.
You know, that it would explain everything, but he just didn't buy that.
Oh, God, what am I going to do?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Unless Unless what?
What?
Ah No, no, yeah, yeah, that wouldn't work.
No, no, what?
Tell me, please.
Well, all right, well, maybe, you know, if well, if he were to walk in here and find you kissing me more passionately than you kissed him Forget it, forget it, forget it.
All right all right.
You know, you never give up.
You are always on the make.
Let me tell you something, buster.
All right.
I still have a little self-respect.
I have a little pride.
Have it your way.
Hello.
Oh.
Ha.
Sorry, Evan, there.
I didn't, uh, didn't hear you come in there.
You know how it is with young lovers, here.
We just can't keep our hands off each other.
Yeah.
You're a lucky man, Sam.
Oh, yeah, you're telling me.
Well, this little honey of mine gives me a lot of good loving, don't you?
Sure do, punkin.
Well, I just came by to apologize for how I reacted earlier.
Apologize?
To me?
Well, yeah, I told Sam outside.
You told Sam?
Gotcha.
So why don't we just not say anything more about it?
I think that's a great idea.
Uh, let me walk you to the car here.
Yeah.
Malone.
No, no.
I think we should say nothing more about this.
Sam, get back here.
Ha.
Some women just can't get enough.
You haven't met my wife, Sam.
Oh Oh Good night.
Hey, listen.
Come on.
I'm just having a little fun with you.
You know, I know why you're upset.
You found out something in that room you hadn't counted on.
Your true feelings were revealed.
What?
No woman can kiss like that and not mean it.
Are you nuts?
No, no, no.
No, it can't be done.
You can't fake passion like that.
Oh, is that right?
Hey, Fras.
Nice try.
Frasier?
Frasier?
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
Hey, how about a couple of beers?
I'm afraid I'm going to have to see some ID.
All righty.
Thank you.
And If I can see yours, please.
Why don't we just forget about it.
Let's just get out of here.
Guys, guys, wait a minute.
Before you run screaming from here, let me ask you something.
This friend of mine is having twins.
All right, it's me.
Now, I don't care if they call each other cute little names like "Chipper and Skipper," or if they pretend to be each other, make their teachers' lives a living hell.
See, what worries me is that they'll have ESP, you know, and they'll communicate silent, evil thoughts and I won't know what they're saying about me.
You think that's weird?
Well?
We're discussing it.
Making your way in the world today Takes everything you've got Taking a break from all your worries Sure would help a lot Wouldn't you like to get away?
Sometimes you want to go Where everybody knows your name And they're always glad you came You want to be where you can see Our troubles are all the same You want to be where everybody knows your name You want to go where people know People are all the same You want to go where everybody knows your name.
Listen up, everybody.
Clifford Clavin has decided to make a major life change.
Don't bother-- you'd be a dorky woman, too.
That's a good one, Carla.
A good one.
All right, Cliffie.
What's up, bud?
There's a new condo complex going up on my route.
You know, one of those places filled with beautiful people having the time of their lives.
I said to myself, Clifford C., you'd take to that place like a fish takes to water.
All slimy with your eyes bulging out?
Shouldn't you be squatting in a field somewhere, Carla?
Well, make a long story short, I am, uh, Boston's newest homeowner.
Bought a condo.
Hey.
Wait, wait.
That means you're moving out on me?
Normie, I can't live with you forever.
Well, you can't do that.
Who's gonna mix Vera's cocoa?
Who's gonna rub her feet?
Who's gonna talk to her?
Normie, I'm afraid you're just gonna, uh, have to pick up the slack.
No.
No, no, no, no, no.
Not me.
Maybe I can hire some high school kid.
Did everybody see that?
Yes, I've started smoking again.
I've been under a lot of pressure, and I needed something to calm my nerves, all right?
And I don't want to hear any stupid remarks about yellow fingernails or kissing ashtrays, and if you use the phrase "coffin nails," you better be a mortician.
Any questions, comments, snide remarks?
No?
Good.
Well, it certainly has calmed her down.
Uh, excuse me.
You know, I have to apologize.
I feel like this is my fault.
What are you talking about?
Well, obviously you started smoking again because you got some sort of pent up sexual frustration going on.
And I don't think we have to tell each other who's responsible for that, now do we?
Oh.
Hey.
Come on, I'm just trying to help here, you know?
You know what you ought to do, you ought to come on over to Dr. Sammy's Stop Smoking Center.
Today's special is a free chest exam.
Sam, is this one of those two-week programs with a simple two-day follow-up?
: Those guys.
Come on in.
Hey.
What a surprise, you guys.
Welcome to Chez Cliff.
Sounds like party central out there.
Well, I just hope that they can, uh, keep up with the Chairman of the Broads.
Cliffie, I brought you the traditional housewarming gift.
Whoa, six-pack.
Yeah.
Well, a five-pack.
Well, uh, so, you guys ready for the grand tour?
Okay.
Yup.
Right here we have the living room.
Mm-hmm.
Right over here is the bedroom.
Whoa.
Hey, slow down, let me catch my breath here.
Whoa, almost forgot the kitchen.
Yeah, I think the builder did, too.
Let me, huh, put these beers on ice here.
Yeah, good idea.
It's not too cold in here, buddy.
Oh, yeah, yeah, I noticed that, Normie.
I think it's the, uh, amalgamator valve.
I've been meaning to strip it down, check out the engine, you know.
I think I better put, uh, some more Freon in the regulator, too.
Or else you could just turn this little dial to cold.
Well, yeah, if you're you know, you want to take a stopgap approach.
Oh, hey, did you notice the pool on your way in?
Yeah.
So when, uh, summer rolls around, and all those girls are out there in their French cut bikinis, I don't have to tell where I'll be.
Standing right here with a pair of binoculars?
That's right.
Boy, oh, boy.
Hey, thanks for coming by, you guys, but, you know, I don't mean to be rude, but, uh, I got to ask you to skedaddle.
I got somebody soft and sweet with a voice like a nightingale coming over.
Who, the busboy from Melville's is coming over here?
No, no, Woody.
Ruben's not coming over here.
It's a it's one of the women in the building.
Wait a minute, Cliffie.
Are we actually talking a female here?
Oh I mean, a real, live, breathing woman, three-dimensional, no posters, no polyurethane?
Well you know, Normie, Sally is the real McCoy, and she is one gorgeous babe, to boot.
All right, well, this I got to see, Cliffie.
Yeah, maybe we could stick around and meet your lady friend, huh?
Uh, no, you know, I, uh, guys, I really don't think that's a very good idea.
Well, why don't you bring her by the bar or something?
Well, you know, I've been trying to get the woman to go out, Normie, but, uh, she just wants to stay, uh, held up here in our little hideaway.
I guess I'm her love hostage.
Well, that's something I definitely don't care to see.
Okay.
Good to see you.
Hey, if I'm not down at the bar, send out a missing swinger's report.
Oh.
Hi.
Hi, Sally.
Hi.
Hi.
Guess what?
I have great news.
What?
I was named employee of the month at the Yarn Barn.
Well, I tied.
That's-that's really great news, Sally.
I'm really happy for you.
So I was thinking maybe to celebrate, we could go out.
I got a-a better idea.
Why don't, uh we just stay in?
Oh, Cliff, we've done that every night this week.
I was thinking maybe we could go to that bar you're always talking about.
You're kidding.
That dive?
Uh, you know, uh, Sally, I, uh spend all day, you know, walking around, uh, uh, outside, and, you know, at the end of the day, I just like to come back to my own little apartment here and just sort of relax and take it easy and, uh get my tensions relieved, if you know what I mean.
Yes, I know what you mean.
I'll get the lights, huh?
Fine, I'll-I'll just get comfortable.
And I'll, uh, meet you on the sofa in about five seconds.
All right.
Have you got the, uh, you know?
Oh, yeah.
And now, here's the host of Jeopardy, Alex Trebek.
Thank you.
Welcome once again to our show.
We are delighted, of course, to welcome back our returning champion, the lady from Boca Raton Uh-oh.
Here comes Madame Nicotine.
I just had the most disgusting morning of my life.
Ooh, can't wait to hear about it.
I just spent the last hour at a no-smoking clinic looking at pictures of ugly ashtrays, rooms filled with smoke, people coughing.
And the worst one was a cigarette snuffed out in the yolk of a fried egg.
Mm.
Bet that stopped you from wanting a cigarette, eh?
No, but I think it's put me off eggs for good.
I'll be in the office, chewing on my hair.
This is going to be fun.
Carla, what are you doing?
I am going to torment her with this fresh pack of cigarettes.
No, Carla, you mustn't!
Carla, now, granted, she's been in rather a foul mood lately, but Rebecca has made a serious life decision, and what she needs now more than anything else is encouragement and support, and I for one am not going to fail her.
Oh, Rebecca?
What do you want, Bone Dome?
!
Here, try these.
They're menthols.
Next case.
Dr. Crane, I-I'm really sorry.
I think I'm just a little on edge.
Look, I apologize, too.
I behaved very unprofessionally.
It's just that I'm really frustrated because I can't seem to kick this habit.
Well, listen, may I suggest something that seems to have worked for many of my patients?
Changing doctors?
Thank you, Carla, no.
You're engaged right now in a psychological battle with your will.
Now, you've got to bring to the foreground every weapon available.
Promise yourself that if you smoke one more cigarette, you'll do the most disgusting, repulsive thing you can imagine.
Dr. Crane, I can't even imagine  Sam Malone if I smoke another cigarette, I'll go to bed with you.
Darn thing's on the blink again.
Excuse me,  Rebecca?
What?
Uh, there's a problem I'd like to talk over with you.
I am really trying to quit, all right?
Oh, no, no, no, it's not about that.
It's, uh I met this girl.
And?
Oh.
People usually stop me at that point.
Anyway, uh night after night I keep begging her to come down to the bar and meet the guys, but she just won't come.
Just wants to stay at home and watch Jeopardy.
Uh, I think that maybe she's a little-little bit ashamed about the way she looks, and she's afraid she might embarrass me.
So, uh, you got any suggestions, or what can I do?
Let me see here.
Um Oh.
Have you ever seen those beauty magazine makeovers?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Sure, sure.
Well, then what are you bugging me for?
Oh, wait a minute.
If you ever see me with a cigarette hanging out of my mouth, would you do me a favor?
What's that?
Kill Sam.
Did you, uh, dab lip gloss on your eyelashes so they sparkle like the North Star?
Yes, Cliff.
I'm coming out now.
Okay.
Listen, don't stand too close, okay?
Try me from a distance first.
Okay.
All right, I'm backing up.
All clear!
Wow.
Gee, thanks, Cliff.
Oh, isn't it about time for Jeopardy?
Huh?
Jeopardy.
Jeopardy.
Uh All right.
Uh Why don't we go out?
Really, Cliff?
Sure.
Great.
Okay.
I'll-I'll just, um, go do a little more blending, and then we'll go.
I'll just, uh, be out here on the front porch and catch a little breath of fresh air.
I got a fox!
Carla, Carla, Carla, Carla.
Ladies room, ladies room.
Please.
No, I'm not following her in there again, Sam.
I'm one puff away from paradise.
Come on.
Please.
There's only so much polite conversation you can make yelling over a stall.
Cliff, this isn't a dive.
Well, no, by a dive, I meant that, uh it was below street level.
Oh, right.
Yeah, let me introduce you to my cronies.
but I gotta warn you first, they can be a little bit crude, all right?
Hey, guys.
Va-va-va-voom, huh?
Hello.
I, uh, thought we'd met all of Cliff's cousins.
Oh, I'm not his cousin.
No, she's my date.
Would you like a little seat here?
I'll get you something to drink.
Nice to meet you.
Likewise.
Well, I'll tell you.
She's what guys back down on the farm where I come from would call ethereal.
Woody, where exactly was this farm?
A couple of beers, there, Wood man.
You got something on her, don't you?
You found something incriminating in her mail.
For God's sake, Cliff, just ask her for money.
Don't be vicious.
Look, look, look, is it so hard for you people, and whatever you are, Carla, to believe that, uh, this, uh, beautiful woman would go out with me on her own accord?
No, of course not, Cliff.
I can think of any number of reasons why a woman might behave that way.
You can?
Well, of course, but remember I'm a psychiatrist.
So, hey, w-where's Sammy?
I wanna show him one gorgeous Bostonian that slipped through his net.
He's over there hauling her in.
Ho!
Ahem!
Sammy!
Oh, Sammy.
Oh, young fellow.
Oh-ho, boy.
Oh, Cliff, do you know each other?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Can I have a word with you, Sammy?
Yeah, see, she's with me.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Excuse us, Sally.
Hey, she is one very pretty lady.
Yeah, thank you, Sam.
Another one of your, uh, cousins?
She's my date.
Really?
Well, is she, um?
Well, we think so.
Well, congratulations, man.
Yeah, yeah.
Great.
Listen, Sam, about that over there No, I'm sorry.
I want to apologize if I was out of line there, but, well, the truth is, you're gonna have to expect that kind of thing happening from now on.
What do you mean?
Well, she's definitely a major-league looker, there, Cliff.
I mean, guys are gonna be hitting on her all the time.
Ah, you don't have to worry about that, Sammy.
Sally is a one-man woman.
Better check your arithmetic there.
Hmm?
Ho!
Hey, Sally.
Cliff, look who's here.
It's Jeff.
From 325.
Hey, I-I know you.
You're the guy with the binoculars.
Uh, Sally, I think it's, uh, about time we, uh, vamoose out of here.
You know, Jeopardy's going to be starting in a little while.
Let's go, Sally.
Listen, uh, Jeff just got a new Porsche Turbo and he wants to take me for a ride.
You don't mind, do you?
Well, uh We'll just be gone a few minutes.
You don't mind, do you.
Oh, no.
No, I-I don't mind.
: That's fine.
I don't care.
I don't mind at all.
Beer here, Woody.
Excuse me, excuse me.
What was that lady doing in there?
Oh, oh, no, no, no.
You know no, you don't understand.
See, we W-Wait a minute.
We have we have this little bet between us.
Let me let me explain here.
See, I get to go to bed with her if she smo Ow!
All right, fine.
ALEX  Jamie Kelt is a correct response, but you forgot to phrase that in the form of a question.
That's why they call it Jeopardy.
Beer, Sam, please.
Are you okay, Cliff?
However, you get to make the next selection.
Jeopardy used to be our show, Normie.
It's just not the same watching it by myself.
I just don't know if I can go on without her.
She's only been gone for ten minutes.
Yeah, I had to make her beautiful, Normie.
I've created a beautiful monster.
What am I going to do?
What is Paraguay?
What is Paraguay?
Right.
Yeah!
All right!
Well, thanks a lot, Normie.
What is Notre Dame?
!
What is Notre Dame?
That's right.
Ooh, yeah!
Hey, hey, hey, Carla.
Do you smell smoke?
Come here.
Of course I smell smoke, you dink.
It's a bar.
I can also smell beer, sweat and lousy tips.
No, no, no, no.
No, she's smoking in there.
I knew she couldn't last this long.
Oh A-ha!
Oh, uh hey, uh, where's the pool table?
Ah, wrong room.
I knew it!
I knew it!
I knew it!
I'm not going to say I knew it, but I knew it.
I knew it.
Now, this was your idea, too.
I did not come up with this.
This is your idea.
What a great idea!
Oh!
Well, what do you say?
Uh, shall we, uh, strip down to our smiles here and show the, uh show the couch here a good time?
No.
We'll go to my place.
Excuse me?
Ooh!
You're really going to go through with this, aren't you?
Yes, I am, but I want to get one thing straight.
Ooh, yeah, yeah.
My smoking has nothing to do with sexual frustration over you or anyone else.
It's just a stupid habit.
But I made a pact, so now I'm going to suffer the consequences no matter how vile or disgusting they may be.
Let's go.
Well You don't really want to do this, do you?
No, it's all right.
I'll just close my eyes and imagine someone appealing.
Besides, I have a feeling it won't take long.
You know, gee whiz, you know, if-if you're not going to get in the spirit of this, then I-I just don't want to do it.
No, come on, come on, a deal's a deal.
No.
Look, I made a pact.
I just want to get it over with.
No, I don't want to do it.
You know, I have some pride.
I have some dignity.
I'll tell you what.
You find someone else to do your dirty work.
Thinks she can mess with Sam Malone.
What happened?
She asked me to go to bed with her, and I said no.
Oh!
Oh, Cliff, I have never driven so fast in my whole life.
I had the best time.
Eh, great, great.
So did I. Cliff, is something the matter?
No, uh, nothing's the matter.
What could be the matter?
I'll tell you what's the matter, Little Miss Porsche.
Try to do a girl a favor, help her become a little bit more attractive, and next thing you know, she's out there attracting people.
Is that what's bothering you?
This makeup?
Is that what all this is about?
Well, yeah, you got to admit, before you put it on, you were a a sweet thing who, uh was content to sit by a dear friend's side on an evening and watch a rousing, wholesome game of Jeopardy.
So all I have to do to make things right between us is take off all this silly makeup and go back to being the way I was?
Wow, you you'd do that for me?
No way.
I like the way I look in makeup.
Wait till they get a load of me at the Yarn Barn.
It makes you look like a cover girl.
I'm sorry, Cliff.
That's what you're stuck with.
You're just going to have to learn to live with it.
Well, I guess I'm big enough of a person not to let your appearance get in the way of our relationship.
I'm glad.
Besides, appearances don't matter at all.
Of course they don't.
Like, it doesn't bother me that you wear those funny white socks.
Of course it doesn't.
Or that it looks as if you trim your mustache with a butter knife.
Eh, another fine example.
Cliff, have you ever considered joining a gym?
Oh, you ever considered wearing flats?
I can help you with that smoking problem, you know.

Hey, good afternoon, all you warmhearted and generous people.
Cliffy.
What's with the box?
Well, the, uh, postal carriers are having a food drive, and if you, uh, good samaritans fill this box with canned goods, I'll, uh, win a free trip to Disney World.
Yeah.
Imagine that-- Pirates of the Caribbean, Mr. Toad's Wild Ride and me.
So, who are the cans for?
Uh, I don't know.
Poor, needy, somebody like that.
Boy, they make such a fuss about Mother Teresa.
Excuse me there, Doctor, but, uh, do I, uh, detect a wry note of cynicism there in your comments?
Cynical?
Me?
How could I possibly be cynical?
Living in a nation in which we celebrate the holy birth of a babe in a manger with Perry Como in Hawaii.
Hey, boss lady, what you all duded up for?
You mean, why am I not wearing a sweatshirt and plastic earrings?
Yeah.
'Cause I just came from the company Christmas party.
Ooh!
Did you corner Mr. Drake under the mistletoe and make nice-nice?
None of your business.
Oh, Rebecca didn't get her Christmas goose.
But I did have plenty of time to make out next week's schedule.
Whoa, whoa, wait a second here.
You got us working on Christmas Eve.
That's a holiday.
No, Christmas is a holiday.
Well, it's a holiday eve.
I'm gonna pay you all time and a half.
No.
Hey.
No, forget it.
We cannot be bought.
I can.
Sweetheart, don't you want to be home with your family?
Would you?
Good point, good point.
Uh, Woody Uh, Woody can't work.
He has to go back to Indiana, be with his folks.
Not this year, Sam.
I'm a big boy now.
I got commitments in the city.
I landed a part in our children's theater production of The Story of Snow.
I play the King of the Flakes.
Hmm.
That'd be a stretch.
Listen We only have a matinee on Christmas Eve, so I'd be happy to work that night, encores permitting.
Great.
Oh, and just so you guys know I'm not pulling rank, I'm scheduled to work that night, too.
No.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Listen, no way am I punching the clock on one of the most sacred of family nights in the whole year.
Oh, and what do you have planned?
An intimate little dinner with one of your nieces?
She makes it sound so cheap.
Oh, joy.
Christmas Eve.
By this time tomorrow, millions of Americans, knee deep in tinsel and wrapping paper, will utter those heartfelt words-- "Is this all I got"?
I hope you're not hanging that there for my benefit.
Are you kidding me?
Who'd want to kiss somebody who makes everyone else work on Christmas Eve?
Oh, all right.
The reviews are in.
We're a hit!
Good for you, Woody.
Let's, uh, take a peek.
Congratulations.
Okay.
"The Story of Snow was way excellent.
"I think any kid in Miss Pedesta's class who misses it is a full-on goon".
And that from the kid who panned Goldilocks.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm gonna call my mom and read it to her.
Yeah?
Boy, I'll tell you, I sure am glad I stayed in Boston after all.
If I was home right now, I'd just be sitting around listening to my aunt and uncle talk about who's dead and who's sick and who lost part of their head in a thresher.
Hello, Mom?
: I miss you all so much.
Would you look at the poor slob?
Forced to humiliate himself in some stupid outfit just to make a few bucks for the holiday season.
Yeah, why doesn't he just wear a sign, "Loser for hire"?
Hey, Peterson?
You're late again.
I'm not covering for you this time.
No, no.
I think you have the wrong Peterson.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Well, when you find the right one, would you tell him not to sweat in the hat so much?
Well guess I'm busted.
Okay, I didn't mention anything to you guys, 'cause I thought that you guys just might razz me a little bit about being a Santa Claus over at Nagle's.
That was you?
Mm.
That's what my kid meant when she says that "Santa smells like the place where Mommy works".
A-Are you making the stuffing bone dry, the way I love it?
Ooh.
Well, can't you freeze some and mail it to me?
Well, no, not the gravy.
That would be stupid.
My mother.
Oh, God.
Can you believe Rebecca?
As long as one customer stays, we all stay.
It's 10:30.
The guy's been nursing the same drink for over an hour.
Yeah, I wish he'd hurry the hell up so we could get out of here.
Christmas tree's okay Presents are all wrapped.
Mm.
All the kids are in bed.
And Eddie's waiting up for me so that we could exchange our goodies in private.
You don't wait until Christmas morning to open your presents?
Oh, yeah, but we like to exchange our goodies in private.
Hey, you know what?
Let's you, me and Woody exchange presents right now, and when he leaves, we can leave.
Come on.
Oh, good idea, yeah.
Ooh.
Dad repainted the Wise Men?
Well, is Balthazar still black?
Hey, Woody, Woody, as soon as you're finished, we're gonna exchange presents.
Okay, Mom, got to go now.
Love you.
Bye.
Here you go, Sam.
Here you go, Carla.
Oh, hey Oh, no, wait.
That Miss Howe's.
You you got something for Rebecca?
Well, it's nothing special.
It's just an antique silver frame with a silhouette of her face that I cut out in black velvet.
Wow.
Oh, I'm glad you like it, 'cause I got you the same thing.
Well, it's your face.
Yeah, I better give her my present now, too.
You-you gave Rebecca a present, too?
You don't even like her.
What are you doing?
It's a Christmas tradition, Sam.
It's called kissing up.
Yeah, and besides, I'd sure feel like a doofus if I didn't get anything for Miss Howe, and she got all those wonderful presents for us.
Oh, man!
I didn't get her anything.
Oh, well, don't feel bad, Sam.
I mean, just because everybody else got her something.
The pretzel salesman, the beer distributor, the relief bartender-- that guy she fired after one day.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, wait a minute, though.
All those guys are just trying to get her in the sack.
I got some shopping to do.
All right, Happy New Year!
Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukah.
Now get lost.
I can't.
Why not?
I'm expecting friends.
Oh, yeah, right.
Merry Christmas, Al.
Merry Christmas.
Well, hello, hi!
Merry Christmas, Al.
Merry Christmas, Al.
Hello.
How are you?
Buon Natale.
Feliz Navidad.
Joyeux Noel.
Merry Christmas and shalom.
Ditto.
Now go home.
And take ten of these deadbeats with you.
Oh, would that I could, Carla, but Lady Bountiful here insists on doling out these obligatory gifts so that people will pretend they like us in the New Year.
My little Scrooge.
If he doesn't cheer up, Santa's going to give him a lump of coal and make him sleep on the couch.
Merry, merry.
Thanks.
Happy, happy.
All right.
Where's Sam?
I've got a little something for him.
Oh, he went to buy a gift for Miss Howe.
Oh, too bad he didn't wait around.
He could have just given her this.
I don't think so.
That's mentholated preshave for tough beards.
Oh.
Just as well.
That's what I got her.
He did it again, damn it!
The third year in a row, Walt Twitchell has cheated me out of my rightful place in the Magic Kingdom.
And he did it by one lousy dented can of Spam.
You know, Clavin, I know you're dying to go to a place where no one looks twice at funny costumes and big floppy ears, but I think you missed the point here.
A lot of food got to needy people.
Isn't that what it's all about?
Well I guess you're right, Carla.
Oh, Mr. Clavin, I'm glad you're here.
I got something for you.
Ah, thanks, Woody, but, uh Wait a minute.
Chow mein and leechy nuts?
Woodrow, think very carefully.
Were these in the bar before 4:00 p.m. today?
Yeah, they were here.
I just forgot to put 'em in the box.
Oh, that makes one more can than Twitchell.
I win.
Deck the halls with suntan lotion.
Disney World, here I come!
Well, I guess it's true what they say.
Charity begins in Orlando.
Oh!
You Yoo-hoo!
Hey, wait, no!
I see you in there!
Hey, come on.
Please, no.
Please, open.
Oh, please!
Hey, please open up.
Excuse Oh, great, listen.
Uh, is there any, uh, store open around here this time of night?
Oh, geez.
Oh, oh, bless you, sir.
Thank you, thank you for being open.
Sorry, we're closed.
Oh Oh!
Merry Christmas.
Are you all right?
No.
No, I'm trying to get a gift for my boss.
Everything's closed, I'm cold, it's wet and I'm miserable.
Well, I've got plenty of presents here.
Maybe you could use one of these?
Well you must be an angel.
You don't have wings under there, do you?
Mm-hmm.
What?
I'm a stewardess.
Oh oh oh, God.
Oh, bless your heart.
Hey!
Well, let's Whoo!
let's see what I've got.
Oh, thank you.
Okay.
Oh, well.
What's this, uh, this one right here?
Oh, those are ear muffs.
But you don't want those, they're too impersonal and boring.
No, they'd be perfect for her.
Your boss is a her?
Yeah, well rumor has it.
Oh, well, I've got some things that I bought for myself she might like.
No, no, the ear muffs are perfect.
Let me just write you out a check here.
Oh, how 'bout a nice silk teddy?
Mm, I love to lounge around in my house with this.
Oh, yeah?
Mm.
Mm-hmm.
Uh what-what else did you buy for yourself in there?
A black lace garter belt.
Ooh.
Trust me, you can never have too many of these.
Ah Mm-hmm.
Let's see, we have baby dolls  and a short kimono : Merry Christmas, Sammy.
and a satin camisole Mmm!
Evening, everybody.
Norm!
Santa, what can I get you?
Finally, someone wants to get me something.
I am so happy this holiday season is over with.
The whining, the crying, the screaming, the temper tantrums Okay, I wasn't your traditional Santa Claus.
Come on in.
Right over there.
I'll get you some beers.
I'll be right with you.
What's with all the bowls full of jelly?
Just having a little get-together after work.
Kind of a class reunion, you know?
Wow, you guys all went to the same school?
Santa school.
It covered all the basics-- the hair, the makeup, how to talk the kids into asking for the big-ticket items.
: Okay.
Whoa, look who's here, huh?
Oh, no, what if a little kid walks in here?
Sweetheart, it's almost midnight Christmas Eve.
What a time to find out.
Why don't you, uh yeah, grab a seat right here and I'll go get us something hot for our toddies, huh?
Thanks, Sam.
All right.
Hey, Carla  I got a present for Rebecca.
See you picked up a little package for yourself, too.
Hey, you, know Why not?
I've been a good boy and it's just what I asked for.
Sam.
Yeah?
Please accept this Merry Christmas from Frasier and me.
Oh, hey, wow, that's great.
Thank you very much.
Listen, I got you something, too.
Um, I left it over in my, uh, other, uh, apartment.
Can, I, uh, can I get it for you next week?
Of course, whenever you'd like, Sam.
Or whenever you get a chance to buy it.
Ignore him, Sam, he has a bug up his chimney.
Oh Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
Yeah, uh, let me have the ear muffs.
That's the, uh my boss lady over there.
Woody, Carla, Sam.
These are just little tokens of appreciation from me to you.
Oh, my you got us presents?
Oh, wow!
You know, there were so many choices, but I think I done good.
A coffee mug with the corporate logo.
A night shirt with the corporate logo.
Yeah, well Thanks.
Thanks.
That's great.
You're welcome.
Oh, and know that I don't expect anything in return.
Oh, um, we got you gifts.
Oh, uh  Yeah Yay!
Here, why don't you, uh, open mine first there?
"To Rebecca from Sam".
Oh, you shouldn't have gone to the trouble.
Oh, just a little something to keep your ears warm.
My God.
Diamond earrings.
I don't believe this!
I don't either.
I thought I was a kiss up, but Sammy wins the pucker sweepstakes.
Hey, if he got her diamonds, I wonder what he got us.
Yeah.
Oh, big whoop-- a wallet.
Thanks for the soap, Sam.
Ooh, and it's pink, too.
Uh, listen, I'm sorry about the mix up here, but my boss seems to really love the diamond earrings.
Can I buy them from you maybe?
Well, they were for my mother.
They cost $500.
$500?
Um, I'll be right back.
Rebecca?
Sam, uh I don't know what to say.
I'm really overwhelmed by your generous gift, but I think it's inappropriate.
You mean you're you're giving it back?
You don't you don't want to keep it?
I think I should.
Oh, well if that's the way you feel, but I I want you to know that I wouldn't have bought these for you unless I wanted you to have them.
Well, they are pretty.
Thank you.
Is that "thank you" you're giving them back to me, or "thank you" you're going to keep them?
I'm afraid that I've misjudged you.
You're very sweet.
Aw.
Would you like to come over to my house tonight for a late supper?
Well, that sounds very inviting.
And I'll wear my new earrings.
: And very little else.
Uh, damn!
Oh!
That witch is gonna make me work tonight.
Yeah, and after I gave her the earrings, too.
I just can't believe it.
Oh, I guess that means there's no lingerie fashion show, then?
Well, maybe we could do it some other time.
What do you think?
Well, I don't know.
It just seemed like such a Christmasy thing to do.
Yeah.
Oh, well.
Just write me a check for the earrings and I'll be going.
All right, and that was be fantastic-- dollars.
And there we go.
All right, uh, well, thank you very much.
You sure, uh, you sure you're not upset about this?
No, I'm just going to go over to my mom's house.
She's probably still up getting everything ready for tomorrow.
Yeah.
You know, baking the bread and icing the cookies and stuffing the turkey.
Yeah.
Stuffing?
Oh, yeah, my mom makes it from scratch.
Gee, so does mine.
Yeah, but does your mom make it bone dry?
You could gag on it.
Hey, don't tell me.
Do you have a manger scene on your front lawn?
The biggest on our block.
Oh The Wise Men are my favorite.
Oh, I love Balthasar.
Oh, Balthasar's good, but Melchior, he's the best.
: Okay, well Listen, I'd introduce you two, but something tells me you've known each other for years.
You driving, Carl?
No way, B.J. I'm over my limit.
Don't ask me.
I'm gonna sleep where I fall.
Yeah Doesn't that just epitomize the spirit of Christmas in the '80s?
Merry Christmas.
A gaggle of pie-eyed Santa Clauses You have a good night.
Take it easy.
all trying to find a designated driver to take the sleigh ride home.
Well I hate to leave, but, uh I've got a busy night, and a long haul ahead of me.
Night.
Anyone remember that guy from class?
No.
I don't, uh Beats me.
I thought he was a friend of yours.
No, no, no.
Not a friend of mine.
No, he came over with you.
No, I could swear that he came with Okay, wait, now wait.
Wait a second now.
You don't suppose  Did you hear that?
Nah Suppose it could be the wind, but it sounded like sleigh bells.
Oh, come on, guys.
I mean, seriously, there must be some explanation.
Well Geez, do you do you think there actually could be a Oh, my wife's gonna kill me.
I left the lights on in the station wagon again.
Can one of you guys give me a jump?
Eh!

Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
Hello.
Carla, what are you doing in?
You're not due in for another hour.
I had to get out of my house.
It was a zoo.
Serafina took the hedge clippers to the shag carpet.
Little Lotte unplugged the refrigerator to see if frozen peas melt faster than ice cream.
Gino made a volcano for a science project in the microwave.
And on top of everything else, me and Eddie had a big fight.
Oh, geez, what about?
He had the nerve to say I don't know how to control my kids.
I don't know.
We just  Hello.
Cheers can't seem to see eye to eye on the right way to discipline 'em.
Carla, it's for you.
: Oh God Hello.
I thought we settled this.
No, you definitely cannot hit him.
No, you cannot lock him in the closet, and you absolutely cannot wash his mouth out with soap.
Anne-Marie, you untie your stepfather right now!
Making your way in the world today Takes everything you've got Taking a break from all your worries Sure would help a lot Wouldn't you like to get away?
Sometimes you want to go Where everybody knows your name And they're always glad you came You want to be where you can see Our troubles are all the same You want to be where everybody knows your name You want to go where people know People are all the same You want to go where everybody knows your name.
Cheers.
Yeah, hi, Carla.
Bye, Carla.
Hey, what was that about?
Uh, it's just Carla reminding us it's her night off.
Normie, you, uh you ever feel like we're getting in a little rut here?
How do you mean, Cliff?
Well, every day, we come into the same bar, sit on the same stools, drink beer, night after I mean, there's got to be something a little bit more to life.
Cliffie, for the last time, I am not changing barstools with you.
Well, I, for one, applaud your desire to shake things up a bit, Cliff.
Sometimes I think I'd give anything for a change-- no matter how slight-- in this deadly, unvarying routine of life.
What can I get you, Dr. Crane?
The usual.
So, Sam, uh, anything interesting in the corporate newsletter there?
Oh, well, let's see here.
Uh yes.
Did you know that the, uh, corporation that owns this bar purchases one percent of all the string made in America?
Whoo!
My blood pressure, Sam, please.
Aw, come on, guys.
There must be something going on in our lives that we can talk about.
Well, Norm, what did you do today?
Well, I just about finished the first coat of paint at Cliff's apartment.
Oh, yawns all around.
Next?
Oh, I got a ticket this weekend.
Oh, Woody, we're not that desperate.
Ah, speak for yourself.
Parking or moving?
Parking, but it was my own fault.
I, uh I let the meter run out while I was watching them film Spencer for Hire.
What?
Spencer for Hire?
That's my favorite!
Was Robert Urich there?
Oh, yeah.
It's his show.
And you saw him?
Oh, my God!
Oh, eh, well, Normie over here's met him.
You lie!
What's he really like?
Well, you know, he just sped past me in his BMW, but he seemed like a real courteous driver.
You know, I've heard that about him.
Oh, would  would you stop it?
I mean, the guy puts his pants on one leg at a time just like everybody else.
Why is everybody so gaga over actors?
Hold it, hold it.
I'm still picturing him with his pants down around his ankles.
So, Wood, how long did you watch them film?
Till some guy came up and put me in one of the crowd scenes.
Now, wait You were in a scene with him?
!
: I can't believe it!
Woody!
Whoa!
You're going to be on national TV?
Weren't you nervous?
Oh, yeah, I was, until I talked to Mr. Urich.
You talked to him?
I'm dying!
What did he say?
He said it was a cold day.
: And what did you say?
I agreed with him.
Ooh, good move.
Then I loaned him my gloves.
Yeah?
What'd he say?
Thanks.
Oh!
Can't you just hear him?
You know, the truth is I know how you feel.
I felt the same way about Haley Mills when I was 12.
When weren't you 12?
Hello, ladies, can I help you?
We're here about the book club.
Oh, you probably have us confused with the public library.
Happens all the time.
It's two blocks down.
This is Cheers, isn't it?
Oh, yes.
But there's no way Excuse me.
I'm Rebecca Howe.
You must be Mrs. Miller.
MRS.
Yes.
We're here to make the final arrangements for our Sunday night meetings.
Great.
Well, let me show you the back room.
I hope everything suits your needs.
Yoo-hoo!
Uh, Miss Howe, can I speak to you for a minute?
Uh, you go on ahead, and I'll join you in just a minute.
What is what is this about a-a book club?
Ever since I arrived here, I have been desperately trying to upgrade the clientele in this bar.
We will upgrade some other night.
Sunday is the night that we have our weekly pool tournament.
You said it.
That's right.
Well, just have your pool tournament another night.
Oh, right!
Like we can, uh, rearrange our schedule here.
Right.
Well, what about Monday night?
Yo, guys, we got a lady right off the boat here, doesn't speak any English.
Tell her what happens Monday night, will you, please?
Football!
How about Tuesday?
Darts Night.
Wednesday?
Well, recovery from Darts Night.
Thursday's Poker Night.
Friday's a night to howl.
And, uh, Saturday night is Date Night, so, uh, where does that leave us?
Horny on Sundays.
Yo.
The book club will meet here on Sunday, period.
Miss Howe?
Oh, come!
We have a few questions.
Of course.
Say, excuse me.
I don't mean to be rude, but, uh, do you ladies comprise a book club?
Yes, that's right.
Well, the salon of the '80s.
You know, it's encouraging to meet a group of adults who still read in this day and age rather than pay homage to the great god, television.
I can't tell you how heartened I am Excuse me.
I have a cigarette going back there.
Of course.
Hey, Woody, when you were on the set there, you see any famous actresses?
Huh?
No.
What about all the drug stuff you hear about in show business-- see any of that?
No.
There's a lot of that juicy backstabbing going on on the set?
No.
Hey, guys, you got to hear these stories.
Yeah.
So, uh, Normie, you think you'll be, uh, through, uh, painting my apartment tomorrow, or what?
Yeah, I'll finish up tomorrow.
Can you have a, uh, check ready for me, Cliff?
Well, I'll, uh give you one now.
Uh, okay, pay to the order of Norman Peterson one zillion dollars!
There you go!
Buy yourself a yacht, young fella.
Cliff, uh, you are going to pay me for this job, aren't you?
Hey, Normie, look, you, uh, didn't charge me last year when you painted Ma's house, did you?
Well, that was before I was a professional.
Oh, I'll say.
We never did get those windows unstuck.
Cliff, I finished half your place.
I'll be happy to come by and finish the rest of it, okay?
I'd appreciate a check.
If you've got a problem with that, why don't we work out a payment schedule right now?
Look, uh, Norm, money is not a problem.
You know that.
It's just, uh, well, I'm not a cheap man.
Oh, a statement I'll wager has never been uttered by anyone but a cheap man.
Look, Norm, if I knew you were going to charge me for all this, I would've demanded a better job.
Now, I've been letting you slide, buddy.
If you think the work is so worthless, just finish it yourself, Cliff.
Well, uh, not that I couldn't.
I mean, it doesn't exactly take a Phi Beta Kappa to stick a brush in a bucket, slap it on a wall, does it?
I mean, any monkey can do that, huh?
Oh, yeah, as opposed to the high level of skill and precision it takes to shove a postcard through a slot.
That's enough, enough, okay, enough, Normie.
I'm, uh, waiting for an apology.
Fine.
I'll drop it in the mail.
That way, you'll never get it.
Well I certainly don't have to stand here and take that.
Mm, good news, everyone.
I've found a way to make him leave.
You'll rue this day, my friend.
I am going to make a laughingstock out of you in front of your whole pseudo-profession.
Very Joan Crawford.
Oh, glad you guys could make it.
Hey, wipe your feet there, would you?
Hey, Mr. C., uh, what time's the game start?
Oh, any minute now, there, Woody.
Hey, look at this place.
So this is what you finally picked out, huh?
Oh, yeah.
Was it everything you'd thought it be, there, Sammy?
No, no, I like it.
Well, you know, I've been meaning to have you guys over here for a while now.
I want to take this opportunity to, uh, make a public apology to my pal Normie here.
I got out of line a little bit, uh, the other night in the bar, and, uh, I just hope you can, uh, find it in your heart to forgive me, there, Norm.
Don't worry about it.
I said some stupid things, too.
All right!
Hey, hey, see that apple in the underwear commercial there?
Yeah.
He played a doorman in my Spencer for Hire.
Oh, yeah?
Talk about range.
You know, it's actually a good paint job, Cliff.
Oh, yeah, thanks, there, Normie.
You know, I, uh you know, I thought I could do this by myself, but, uh, when I started, I realized that I needed somebody with your specialized skills and talents, eh Well, well, takes a big man to admit that, Cliff.
Ah Glad you appreciate the value of professional labor.
Oh, yeah, I sure do, uh Listen, if you guys don't mind, I'd like to introduce you to the, uh, skilled artisan who did this fine work.
Yeah, he's in the, uh, bathroom over here, finishing up.
Uh, hey, Duane, come out here.
Cheers.
Oh, hang on a second.
Mr. Peterson, it's Mr. Clavin.
Come on, now, it's been a whole week.
Maybe he wants to make up.
Take a message.
Can I take a message?
Okeydokey.
What'd he say?
What are you doing, there?
Miss Howe put moi in charge of refreshments for the book club.
Well, yeah, but what are those?
Finger sandwiches.
You know, the part that takes the most time is getting that middle knuckle right.
Woody, they don't actually have to look like fingers.
Yeah, right, Sam.
Boy, it hardly feels like a Sunday without a pool cue in my hand.
Yeah.
Why don't we go to Old Town Tavern, shoot some stick?
No, no, no, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What, are you kidding?
Tonight happens to be Woody's big debut on Spencer for Hire.
Can't imagine what it's going to be like to see, uh, somebody we actually know up on that TV screen.
Yeah.
Well, Norm, I'm-I'm loathe to chide you for your short memory, but I appeared on the tube just a few short weeks ago.
Oh, well, yeah, Frasier, uh, no offense, but a bunch of do-gooders sitting around jabbering about a nuclear freeze is one thing.
We're talking prime time cop show here.
Evening, ladies.
I'm really excited about you being here.
The rest of your group's already in the back.
Oh, thank you very much.
It should be a special evening.
Tonight, we're discussing English agrarian life before the Reform Bill as portrayed in Elliot's Middlemarch.
Would you care to join us?
You know, actually, we were just discussing that at the bar, and I'm a little burned out on it.
Oh.
Miss Howe?
I put the tea and the lemonade in the back for the ladies, and, uh, these are ready for you.
Thank you, Woody.
Woody, when I said I wanted finger sandwich These look delicious.
Excuse me.
Yes, yes, yes.
I'm missing something in my tea.
All right, uh, lemon here?
Sugar?
A touch of brandy.
Ah.
Well, all right.
There you go.
Don't be shy.
Thank you very much.
Bye-bye.
Hey, hey, everybody.
My Spencer for Hire is on.
Woody, when's your big scene?
It's hard to tell.
You know, in television, we shoot out of sequence.
I wonder if you might have a little gin back there.
Gin, in a bar?
Uh whoa!
It's your lucky day.
There you go.
Thank you.
See, I've had this cold.
That's, that's the street I was on!
That's my scene!
PATRONS : Woody!
Woody!
Woody!
There I am!
Where?
!
Where?
!
Where are you?
There!
Right there in the corner!
That's a fire hydrant.
No, no, right next to it.
That's my sleeve!
Woody, we can't see your face.
What?
!
Don't you recognize my shirt?
That distinctive plain white one?
All right, well, now it's gone to commercial.
You missed it.
Oh, Woody, you telling me?
That's it?
!
Hey, you know, lots of people have white shirts.
And arms.
How do we know you were even on the show, Woody?
Of course I was.
Oh, you got to believe me.
Oh, yeah, I bet that's you driving the little chuck wagon right now, huh?
Yah!
Yah!
No, no, no.
I swear.
I met Robert Urich and everything.
Yeah, Wood, let us know when your pants are on Dallas.
What shall we do with a drunken sailor?
What shall we do with a drunken sailor What shall we do with a drunken sailor Earl-aye in the morning?
Hey-oh, up she rises God, not again.
Hey-oh, up she rises, hey-oh What the hell is happening to our book club?
I think it had something to do with that last round of margaritas.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
That does it!
I am putting a stop to this right now.
No, let me handle this.
You're not used to dealing with those rowdy book club types.
Sam, this is my bar.
I am in charge.
All right.
I am perfectly capable of restoring order.
You are so cute when you're macho.
Hey, Woods.
I'm just curious, um, did a lot of other shirts audition for that role?
Hey, Woody, there's an article in here that says your shirt is now dating Morgan Fairchild.
But she says they're just friends.
Come on, guys.
I'm telling you, I really did do it.
Sure thing, Woody.
Cheers.
Oh, hi, Robert Urich.
Yeah, yeah, this is your old pal, Woody.
Oh, well, I thought your performance was wonderful tonight, too.
Yeah.
: Yeah.
What?
Oh, uh, yeah, that shirt?
Yeah, I-I picked it out myself.
Uh, Sears, I think.
Yeah, okay, well, thanks for calling.
I'll see you around the studio.
All right, bye.
See?
How could we have ever doubted him?
Boy, do we have egg on our face, huh?
Go on!
Boy you sure, uh you sure taught them a lesson, didn't you?
By the way, what, what do they do with a drunken sailor?
Malone?
Get in there.
Oh, so you do need me, huh?
The right man for the job.
No, no, no.
You don't understand.
They asked for you.
They did?
Yes, they said, "Send in"  Did you hear that?
What did you?
Could you say that slower, please?
"The tall hunk with the rippling rump".
And you automatically thought of me.
Isn't that interesting?
Would you just get them out of here, please?
I will ripple them into submission.
Are you catching that?
Said the monkey to the Hey, guys.
Hey.
Hi, Cliff.
Hey, where's your monkey?
Oh, no, it's not my monkey.
I just rented him to play a little, uh, joke on Normie.
Good one, huh, Zippy?
Yeah, it gets funnier every time you mention it, Cliff.
It was funny when you sent me over that crate of bananas, really funny when you started having my mail addressed to "Cheetah".
Particularly hilarious when you sent over the organ grinder.
You know, Cliff, you just keep getting funnier and funnier.
You get any funnier, I may have to kill you.
Ho!
Ho!
ho!
Ho!
That's it, call the cops.
What are they doing?
They're grabbing me, teasing me, making fun of me, and stuffing money down my shorts.
Hey, small bills, too.
That's great.
: Fresh meat!
Fresh meat!
Send in the young one!
Fresh meat!
Fresh meat!
Say, is the, uh, book club still meeting?
After a fashion.
Oh, well, good.
You know, I dropped by the office and dug up an old paper I wrote when I was an undergrad.
I was always rather proud of it.
So I thought I might share it with them.
Frase, I don't think you understand what's going on back there.
Oh, Sam, you're hardly one to condescend to me.
Oh, ladies!
Good God!
Please!
I'm a doctor.
Good night.
Bye-bye.
Good night.
Good night.
Thank you.
Good night.
Not bad for a night's work.
You got for I only got ten.
Well, Sam, perhaps you didn't, uh, shake it until they couldn't take it.
Now, let me see.
Where are my keys?
Oh, that's right.
I was using them as castanets.
What are you doing, Woody?
I'm wringing my hands with guilt.
Oh.
I don't think I've actually seen that before.
Why?
I told a terrible lie to the guys, Sam.
Oh, you mean about being on that TV show?
No, no, that was true, but I got a telephone call, and I pretended it was Robert Urich on the other end.
I mean, I-I didn't hurt anybody or anything.
Although your-your plumber seemed a little confused.
Well, I'm Don't worry about it.
I'm sure everyone will forgive you.
But it was a lie, Sam, and I've never told a lie before.
What?
No, no, wait.
That's a lie.
I-I've told lies See, now, that's two lies.
See how much easier it gets?
Oh, my God, I'm out of control.
What's next?
Murder?
No, no, hey, Woody, Woody, Woody Woody, Woody.
Looks like the old pool tournament is out again for next week.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah?
Fancy that.
Well, did you tell Norm?
When he hears that, he'll go ape.
Cliff, your delivery of jokes is as bad as your delivery of the mail.
Oh!
Oh!
Mighty Joe Young strikes back there.
How'd you become a mailman anyway?
What, did you flunk out of tollbooth school?
Hey, all right, now, that's a good one.
Yep.
Know why, uh, dogs hate mailmen?
They just want to be like everyone else.
All right, that's it.
It's go time.
Okay, fellas, this is the guy I've been telling you about.
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Wait!
Wait!
Wait!
Wait!
No, come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Cli Look at yourselves, here.
Cliff!
Cliff, this is your friend, Norm.
Norm, this is your buddy, Cliff.
You don't want to do this.
Now, do you?
All right, all right!
Hey, whoa!
Somebody help me here, man, will you?
Hey, stop!
Hey, stop it, now.
Listen, I You guys have been friends for years.
Think of all the things you've done together.
You, you Drinking beer together.
And I'm sure there's a lot of other stuff, too.
Hey, you know, you're partly at fault here.
You made fun of his profession, and you refused to pay him.
And you, Norm Actually, you didn't do anything at all, did you?
I'll tell you what.
Why don't you let me hold him, and you biff him one?
I don't know, Sammy.
I just want this to be over with.
Yeah, me, too.
Well, I'm sorry, Norm.
Just make out a bill, and I'll pay it.
I'll give you that discount.
All right, uh, I I guess that monkey stuff was a little bit out of line, huh?
It was actually pretty funny, but  It's a small man who can't laugh at his own profession, you know?
Yeah.
I just want to let bygones be bygones, all right?
And the important thing is we're just still friends, hmm?
You mind, guys?
Oh, oh, no, sorry, sorry.
Hey, hey, come on.
Yeah, Normie, I'm, uh, I'm sort of sorry about everything that happened.
Oh, well, Cliff, I'm even sorrier for what's about to happen.
Huh?
What do you mean?
You're dead meat, Peterson!
Let's go shoot some stick.
Hey, Woody.
Hey, Bob, how are you doing?
Fine.
Look, I was just passing by, and I wanted to return your gloves.
Thanks for letting me use them.
Hey, my pleasure.
Listen, could you hang on a second?
Sure.
I got some friends you'd love to meet.
Yeah.
Miss Howe?
You'll never guess who's here.
Bob Urich.
Woody, it's been a horrible night.
I'm really not in the mood to be teased.
No, no, it's the truth.
He's really here.
Woody, go away!
She's a big fan of yours.
Hey, guys!
Bob Urich's here.
Oh, sure, Wood.

Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
Oh!
Oh!
Sam, I think Carla has a drink order.
Sweetheart, are you all right?
Sammy, I think this could be it.
I think the twins are coming.
Oh.
Ooh, ooh!
What do you know?
The Sixers are in town tonight.
Isn't it amazing how Carla's labor pains always seem to coincide with Celtic home games?
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Wait a minute.
Now, you think that I would exploit this beautiful thing called motherhood just to go to some stupid basketball game?
I'm insulted!
Carla, I'm not falling for it this time.
You can scream till you shatter every glass in this bar, but you're not going anywhere.
Sweetheart, you're just going to have to give birth right here in the bar.
Come on.
It won't be that bad.
Remember, the last kid you had here was no big deal.
All you had to do was a little snip-snip and a quick mop-up and you were right back on your feet.
Let me call you a cab, Carla.
It's all right.
I got one waiting.
Thank you.
Hey, uh, there wouldn't happen to be another seat in the delivery room, would there?
No, no.
There are only seats for me and Eddie, Sam.
Oh, come on.
Maybe next child.
Making your way in the world today Takes everything you've got Taking a break from all your worries Sure would help a lot Wouldn't you like to get away?
Sometimes you want to go Where everybody knows your name And they're always glad you came You want to be where you can see Our troubles are all the same You want to be where everybody knows your name You want to go where people know People are all the same You want to go where everybody knows your name.
Announcement!
Announcement!
I just got a phone call, and if things work out, it might be my ticket out of here.
Don't you even want to know what it's about?
There's more?
Yes.
I have been asked to organize a cocktail party for Mr. Daniel T. Collier.
Ooh, Daniel T. Collier, the lemon wafer king?
No, no, that's Donald P. Cooper.
Hey, I love those lemon wafers.
You ever dip them in cocoa and try to get them out without breaking them?
Yeah, yeah.
Do you know you can make a mock apple pie with those?
Excuse me.
Those are Ritz Crackers.
Stop talking about wafers!
This is Daniel T. Collier, the chairman of the board, the chief executive officer of Lillian.
Oh Sammy, don't you have, like, the slightest bit of guilt selling this bar to a corporation named Lillian?
Well, we used to be called Drax Chemical, Dye and Munitions, but people had trouble believing our motto: "We care about people".
Okay, I'm going to need the best of everything: the best food, the best liquor.
The best bartenders.
You?
Good one, Sam.
Did I say something funny here?
Well, actually, I didn't get it either.
I was just laughing to be polite.
But in my own defense, I do get some things that no one else does.
When there's a shine on your shoes There's a melody in your heart Shiny shoes, huh?
Shiny shoes, shiny shoes.
Ah, gents, notice anything different about me today?
Okay, I'll go out on a limb.
New shoes?
Yes, siree, Normie.
And for a limited time only, thanks to the US Postal Service, you, too, can be saying to your feet, "Thanks for your support".
Are we to deduce from this, Cliff, that you are now selling mail-order shoes?
I am not selling shoes here, Doctor.
I'm selling dreams.
Dreams of a little cobbler in Missouri who pours his heart into every sole.
Actually, Cliff, with a pair of dark socks those could look halfway decent.
How much are they, Cliff?
$19.99.
Well, what the heck?
For 20 bucks, I'll give it a shot.
All right, order me a size 11.
Normie, Normie, Normie, these are not your assembly line clodhoppers.
These are precisely machine-measured.
How do I do it then?
Just trace your tootsies on a cocktail napkin over here, fellas, all right?
I'll tell you.
This brings back memories of my dad when I was a kid.
Did you all always used to order your shoes through the mail?
He was always getting taken by some huckster.
Sam, if you were throwing a party, would you order Dom Perignon or Cristal?
Cristal.
Dom Perignon it is, then.
This is getting insulting.
You know, I don't think that she respects us.
What do you mean "us," Sam?
You're the one who goofed up that champagne thing.
Woody, come on, man.
We're a team.
Is that the insulting part?
This the point is, she doesn't think that we're worthy of hanging around with her society friends.
She thinks we're nincompoops.
Nincompoops?
Let's go, Sam.
We're going to talk to her.
What?
Nobody calls Woody Boyd a nincompoop.
Except my dad.
Miss Howe, with all due respect, that nincompoop crack really hurt.
Woody, I didn't call you a nincompoop.
All right, then why you won't let us tend bar at your party?
Is it because you think we're incompetent?
You think we're not smooth enough?
You think we're uncouth?
No, I need you here.
Oh, okay.
Let's go, Sam.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
Sam, now, look.
Really, why do you care?
Why on Earth do you want to work this party?
All right, you know, by not hiring us, what you're doing is you're telling the rest of the world that Sam Malone is not fit for the society of decent folks, that he's incompetent, that he's a clod.
What about me, Sam?
You, too, Woody.
I'm going to tell you something, lady.
We may not have come out of Harvard.
We may not belong to a yacht club.
We may not have tended bar at a polo tournament, but we know how to do our job and we do it with dignity and class.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
The job is yours.
All right!
Whoa, baby!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Whoo, baby!
Lovely party, Rebecca.
Why, thank you, Mr. Collier.
Isn't this place something, Sam?
Ooh, yeah.
I think it's even nicer than Wheeler's Funeral Parlor in Hanover.
Of course, that's not the most fun place in town.
Well, I'll bet not.
That would be Bob's Funeral Parlor.
Oh, my God.
Woody, is it me or is that woman gorgeous?
You look nice, Sam, but I'm going to have to go with the woman.
Do me a favor here, will ya, buddy?
Hold down the fort here while I pass that lady a tray of smoked Sammy.
Great party, huh?
Yes.
I'll have a Manhattan.
What?
Oh, this.
Well, you think I'm a bartender, huh?
What do you think you are?
Well, to tell you the truth, I used to be a bartender, but now I'm an eccentric millionaire.
I just dress like this to remind myself of my modest beginnings.
Back behind the bar.
I pay her to say that.
It keeps me humble.
Malone, now!
Ooh, that was a good one, huh?
I'm going to have to give her a raise, huh?
Looking good.
Woody, what are you doing?
!
That is not a trash can.
That is a work of art.
Oh, my God.
This is just what I need is for Collier to see this.
He is a collector.
Oh, hey, let's calm down now.
Nobody's seen anything yet.
Woody, take it in the kitchen and clean it out.
Sure, Sam.
Sorry, Miss Howe.
Woody, go.
Just go.
I got you.
I got you.
I tell you, Sam.
This is the last time I'm going to throw one of these fancy parties.
The next time one of these hotshots wants  Don't worry, Ms. Howe.
It was only a tray of glasses.
Thank God.
Let's not tempt fate, Woody.
I'll clean it myself.
They weren't great glasses, Sam, and they were dirty.
Just a guess here: uh, the vase?
It was there.
I was holding it.
It was right in my hands, and now it's gone.
Maybe we can glue it back together and no one will ever know.
Forget that.
Oh!
Just calm down now.
Calm down.
It was an accident.
I'm sure Mr. Collier will understand.
No, he won't.
This isn't the first time I've goofed up at the company.
I started out as a junior executive and I'm diligently working my way down to the mailroom with a brief stopover at that Siberia called Cheers.
Shh-shh.
Stop it.
Just calm down here.
Calm down.
I know.
I'll just resign now, move back to San Diego, join the Navy, grow old and die.
Oh Boy, Sam, I really feel sorry for her.
Never thought I'd say it, but so do I. Look at this party she threw together here, and then that happens.
Poor kid.
You think they'll make me manager?
Hey, yo, over here.
You know, Woody, I'm about to do a decent thing here.
Get out.
Yeah.
I'm going to take the fall for this.
What the hell?
I'm a great bartender.
I can get a job anywhere I want.
Sam, that's the second nicest thing you've ever done.
Well, thank you.
What's the nicest?
When you let me drive your Corvette.
Right.
Right, right.
That's good.
That's good.
Excuse me, young man.
What happened to the vase that was sitting there?
Somebody move it?
Sir, I have a confession.
My name is Woody Boyd, and by accident, I broke your vase.
You you broke it?
!
You Do you know how many years I waited to add that to my collection?
Do you realize the significance of that piece?
No, sir.
And I also broke some glasses.
No, Sam, I can't let you do it.
It wouldn't be right if you Uh, Mr. Collier, there's been a terrible accident.
Yes.
This person just told me how he destroyed my vase.
But Woody didn't do it.
What she means is I didn't do it on purpose.
Yes, I know.
The only thing that can match my great disappointment at losing the vase is the admiration that I feel for this boy.
Woody, you showed great courage and integrity in stepping up to face the music here.
Rebecca, would you mind standing in for Woody for a little while?
You wouldn't mind, would you?
I'd like to get to know him better.
You want a drink?
Well, sure.
Well, just tell the girl.
Miss Howe, I'll have a gin and tonic.
Well, come on.
She'll bring 'em in.
Oh.
Another Manhattan.
Manhattan, huh?
I own a lot of that, you know?
Right, the eccentric millionaire routine.
You know, I got to tell you the truth here.
I'm getting kind of bored serving all these stiffs drinks.
What do you say you and I go out and spend some of my money?
What time does France close anyway?
I think they're remodeling.
Oh.
Have any other suggestions?
Unfortunately, my mansion's being painted and my yacht's in dry dock.
Well, let me see Oh, I know it.
I know it.
You know, my chauffeur's got a little one-bedroom apartment downtown.
What do you say you and I go slumming?
Let me guess: you're not really rich at all, are you?
Well, now, define "rich".
I have my health.
I uh, think I'll just stick with the drink.
Let me get this straight: when you thought that I was a millionaire, you were ready to go out with me, but now that I'm just a healthy bartender, you don't want to have anything to do with me.
I gotta tell you, lady, that makes you an incredibly shallow person.
Do you actually think this sort of approach is going to work?
Absolutely.
You see, I'm an incredibly shallow person myself.
Between the two of us, we couldn't make a decent wading pool.
What do you say, huh?
Don't I know you from somewhere?
Yeah, well, you probably caught me out at Fenway, huh?
Of course.
I bought a bag of peanuts from you.
Another round of brandies for Butch and Sundance.
They're really, uh, hitting it off, huh?
I should say so.
They're in there singing school songs.
If you hate Ivy League fight songs, wait till you hear one from bartending school.
You're not taking this very well, are you?
What, that little backstabber?
Oh, now cut that out.
Woody took a big risk, you know.
You broke the vase and he took the blame for it.
It didn't have to turn out that way.
He just had your best interest at heart.
I know.
I could just hug him till his tongue turns black.
You know, I'm not convinced you're a millionaire, but I am sold on the eccentric part.
Well, that's a start.
And since I'm not getting any interesting nibbles tonight anyway, I'm reconsidering your offer.
Nibbles are my specialty.
Great.
Well, what time will you be getting off?
Oh, listen, I've got to show you a trick shot.
Now you watch this.
Got you again, Pinky!
You can't do that!
Oh, uh You seem to have something in your eye, Woodhead.
I'll get it for you.
Oh, Pinky, stop!
It's noogie time!
Oh, no!
No!
No!
No, Woody!
No!
No more!
I see our serving wench is here.
I mean, hello, Miss Howe.
: Oh, Woody.
I tell you, you have no idea how hard it is to find young fellas with your stuff in this day and age.
You ought to see the buttoned-down brats my granddaughter drags home from college.
She really deserves someone more solid, someone real.
Someone with a strong back and a thick neck, you know?
Someone like you, Woody.
Thank you, sir.
I couldn't.
Yeah, I could.
She's out in Vail right now on a skiing holiday.
I'm going up there tomorrow.
Woody, why don't you join me?
You mean that, Pinky?
You bet I do.
Well, I don't know if Miss Howe would be too happy Oh, she'll be thrilled.
To my toes.
See?
So, great, I'll go tell Jamison to arrange it right now.
Ah!
Woody, where do you get these things?
!
Go figure, Miss Howe.
I mean, you break the vase, and I end up being the big boss' buddy.
Isn't life funny?
Do you mean funny "ha-ha" or funny "a living nightmare"?
Is something wrong, Miss Howe?
Yes, something is wrong.
I am the one who should be playing pool.
I'm the one who should be smoking cigars and drinking brandy.
I'm the one who should be going out with his granddaughter.
You know what I mean.
Well, I'm sorry, Miss Howe.
I was only trying to help.
Okay, Woody, we're all set.
I'll stop by the bar tomorrow afternoon and pick you up.
Pinky, I have a confession.
I didn't break your vase.
Miss Howe did.
Whew, glad I got that off my chest.
You broke my vase?
Well, actually, yes.
That's the most cowardly thing I have ever heard.
You'd let this fine young man take the blame for your clumsiness?
I don't know, Miss Howe.
I'm going to have to seriously reconsider your future with our organization.
Uh, Pinky, wait a minute here.
Uh, Miss Howe is a very nice lady.
Klutzy, sure, but she has a heart of gold.
Well well, all right.
Woody, if you'll vouch for her, I'll give her another chance, I guess.
Thanks, Pinky.
Hey, by the way, your barn door's open.
Woody!
Hey, everybody.
Look what the shoe fairy left under my pillow.
Okay, Fox and Hounds, that's you, Pete.
Uh, Hugh, you had the Executives.
Uh, Norm, you had the Old Smoothies, didn't you?
Uh, let's see-- Frasier.
Would you give those to Frasier?
All right, who had the, uh, Playboy?
Who else?
Hold it.
Hold it.
Wait a minute.
You bought shoes from Boston's fashion king, Oh Leg the Weenie?
Yeah.
I can't leave you guys alone for a minute.
Hey, Cliff, I got to hand it to you.
These are really comfortable.
Eh, you bet ya.
What style are these?
The Star Fighter.
Oh.
Yes.
I was sorely tempted to get the Coup de Villes, but, uh, I do love tassels, so  Cliffie, mine squeak.
Uh, after a few weeks of constant wear, it'll be all right.
Make it stop.
Normie, what's the big deal?
I mean, squeaky shoes are only a problem if you're a mugger.
Cliff, mine are a little squeaky, too.
Mine are squeaking, too, Cliff.
In E Minor.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, stop!
Freeze, everybody.
Back on your barstools right now.
Go on.
Hurry up.
Thank you.
Miss Howe.
May I see you for a moment?
Yes, sir.
He's changed his mind.
I'm doomed.
Next stop: hell.
Compliment his tie.
Last night at the party someone broke an irreplaceable vase.
That's a very nice tie.
Are you listening to me?
We found the remains in the trash.
Now, is it any of your people?
You mean you don't know who broke it?
Unfortunately, I had a little too much to drink.
The whole evening's rather foggy.
And you mean you don't remember anything, and you have no idea who did it?
No, but when I find out, they're going to wish they never crossed my path.
'Cause I'll find a way to make their life a living hell.
I don't blame you.
And you know, when you find out who did it, give me a call, because I'd like to give them a piece of my mind.
Guess who, Pinky?
!
Woody!
Woody!
What in God's name do you think you're doing?
Oh, I'll show you what I'm doing.
Ah!
Noogie!
Who is this madman?
This is Woody Boyd.
Woody, last night, a very valuable vase was broken at Mr. Collier's.
But he doesn't remember who did it.
Of course he knows who did it.
It was Fire!
Fire!
What fire?
Now wait.
Hold it!
Now hold it.
There is no fire.
She didn't say "fire".
Uh, she said "flyer".
Yes, yes, I thought I saw Amelia Earhart up there.
Great, uh, nice save, Rebecca.
What in God's name is going on here?
Well, it's the, uh Squeaky Shoe Club.
Look, I intend to get to the bottom of this.
Now Miss Howe, you were in charge of that party last night.
Do you or do you not know who broke my vase?
Of course she does.
I certainly do.
It's time the truth came out.
It was Me.
No, Sam.
Yes, Rebecca.
I want to do this.
You, huh?
Sir you have grit.
You don't ski by any chance, do you?
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
Making your way in the world today Takes everything you've got Taking a break from all your worries sure would help a lot Wouldn't you like to get away?
Sometimes you want to go where everybody knows your name And they're always glad you came You want to be where you can see Troubles are all the same You want to be where everybody knows your name You want to go where people know people are all the same You want to go where everybody knows your name.
So, did you get a chance to see Carla's babies?
Oh, we sure did.
There are two of the cutest little guys you've ever seen.
Ah, who do they look like, Carla or Eddie?
Well, they're twins.
They kind of look like each other.
What's this?
"Carla's Tips".
Yeah, it was Carla's idea.
She does some of her best thinking in labor.
This is ridiculous.
How does she expect to be tipped if she's not even here?
Well, actually, she's doing a lot better than she usually does.
Hello, Samuel.
Hey.
Well, pardon my appearance, everybody.
We always do.
Sorry.
I was covering for Carla.
Oh, hey, you're doing a fine job.
The reason why I look like I've been up all night is because, well, I've been up all night reading that little opus.
All right, Lust for Justice.
Yeah, Vera talked me into reading this.
Oh, is she a fan?
No, no.
When Vera's talking, I'll read just about anything.
Yeah.
I almost ruptured a disc delivering those Book of the Month club copies and I decided to see what all the hooha was about.
Yeah, two thumbs up, right?
Oh, yeah.
Finest piece of trash not written by a Junta or Jackie in modern literature.
Good Lord.
Another piece of salacious mind candy.
God, this is over Who could imagine he'd know this many words?
Yeah, well I checked.
He uses a lot of them twice.
Yeah, well, Frasier, you want to borrow it then?
No way you'll find me reading it.
Just look at these reviews.
Suit yourself.
"I couldn't put it down".
Cheers.
Oh, yeah, she is.
Miss Howe, Mr. Drake.
Mr. Drake?
I wonder what he's calling about.
Woody, how did he sound?
Happy, mad, pleasant, annoyed?
Well, he sounds kind of weird.
Like an old woman with a lisp and a thick German accent.
Woody, that's his secretary.
Oh, well, then she sounded pretty happy.
Hey, Anthony, Annie, what's up?
Sam, I'm swallowing my Tortelli pride to ask if I might borrow five bucks.
That was very difficult for him.
Is it okay?
I want to get a present for my mom and the twins.
Sure.
What are you going to get them?
Five bucks.
She'll like that.
Thanks, Sam.
Hey, I don't know when I'll be able to pay you back.
Job market's been really bad lately.
I haven't been able to find a job anywhere.
Actually, we have an opening for a temporary waitress to sub for your mom.
What do you think?
Ah, I don't want to be a waitress.
No, I was thinking about her.
No, I don't want my wife to work.
I could do it if I want to.
Nuh-uh.
Nuh-huh.
Nuh-uh.
Nuh-huh.
Nuh-uh.
W-Why don't you two talk about it.
Of course we will.
Communication is the cornerstone of our marriage.
Nuh-uh.
Nuh-huh.
Well, well, well.
Hey, Normie, look who's developed a lust for justice.
Yeah.
Do you mind?
Lorenzo is hemorrhaging.
Oh, he dies.
Don't tell me.
Don't tell me.
Yeah, yeah, that's true.
We don't want to spoil the part where Monica first comes in.
Were you shocked or what when she turned out to be a man?
Oh, no, no, I saw I wish I was in the land of cotton Old times there are not forgotten Look away, look away, look away You know, sometimes I like to play little guessing games.
Do you like to play little guessing games, guys?
Let's play a little guessing game.
I just spoke to Mr. Drake and he suggested that I hire a young girl he knows to cover for Carla.
Now, why do you suppose a busy, important man like Mr. Drake would take time out of his day to get a simple cocktail waitress a job?
Oh, oh, oh.
Uh, she's, uh Norm.
She's a friend of the family.
Possible.
He's, uh, paying off a debt.
I like that.
He feels sorry for her.
He does have a soft heart.
Maybe she's sleeping with him.
Of course that little tramp is sleeping with him!
Do you think I'm stupid?
Is this still part of the guessing game?
No, no, no.
This is just too perfect.
Evan found a nice little bowl for his goldfish to swim in.
Safe, out of the reach of the other executive sharks.
Obviously, he forgot about the Great White Sammy.
Well, we've reached a compromise, Sam.
I'm taking the relief waitress job.
Great.
What's the compromise?
I'm letting her.
Wait a minute.
I am in charge around here and it is my responsibility to hire people, and I have just be informed that I am hiring someone else.
They're going through a tough time right now.
Why don't you let Annie work just for tips?
Tips?
!
Yeah.
If I'm gonna work here, I demand a set salary, plus tips, plus two coffee breaks, plus weekends off.
That is completely out of the question.
Okay, then I demand that tip thing.
It's a deal.
I need a Scotch, rocks, two white wines and a draft.
Okeydokey.
Come on, corn cob.
Arriba.
Boy, I tell ya, Annie's getting to be a real pro, huh?
Yeah, she's sure rattling off those drink orders, huh?
That's nothing.
How about the way she puts me in my place?
Can you believe it?
Her first day on the job and Evan's little tart is late.
That's because she knows I can't do anything about it because her lover boy is the big boss.
Isn't she just the queen of gall?
Oh, no, that was Charlemagne's wife, I think.
Well, you know, if memory serves, I think her name was Cathy.
Listen, have you ever thought that you're reading this whole thing wrong?
That maybe she's just a four-eyed little geek that Evan Drake is trying to help out?
Right.
And Cliff is leaving his brain to science.
I guess, you're still covering for Carla, huh?
Guess again.
Okay, uh, here's another possibility.
Instead of firing someone, you send them to the worst job in the organization.
Usually the poor schlep just gets fed up and quits.
They've tried that on me a bunch of times.
Works like a charm.
You know, you might be right.
She's probably just some pathetic little dishrag whose last great hope is working here at Cheers.
I got to stop jumping to conclusions.
Excuse me.
Is Miss Howe here?
Mr. Drake sent me.
Oh, you must be the slut.
Excuse me?
Slot.
You're here to fill the slot.
Welcome to Cheers.
Why don't you just follow me in to my office and we'll fill out your W-4 form.
Great.
And I'll need a phone number and a job history, and a number we can call in case you meet with some horrible disfiguring accident.
Sam?
What?
Could I ask your opinion as a passionate macho stud horse?
Sure.
I may have to stamp out the answer with my foot, but go ahead.
Well, it's bad enough that Anthony's lost all his ambition and can't get a job.
Right.
But ever since I started working here, he's become insanely jealous.
Why am I late?
When am I coming home?
Why am I dressed like such an ultra-fox?
I mean, if it weren't for the six times a day we make love he'd be no fun at all.
Six?
Whoo!
Can't think of anything that I can do six times a day.
Hit me again.
Will you, Sam?
Listen, it's kind of tough on a husband, you know, to have his wife supporting him.
It's a It's a pride thing.
It is a pride thing, Sam.
I remember once when I was out of work, Vera had to support us.
I tell ya, the day that woman left to deliver phone books The proudest day of my life, actually.
What do you want me to do?
You want me to talk to him?
Would you, Sam?
Thanks.
Yeah.
Yeah, you're welcome.
Hey, I saw that!
Anthony!
I can't believe you're spying on me.
Suddenly, everything makes sense.
You're taller than me.
You have a Corvette instead of a bus pass.
And your hair does that cool blow-dry thing.
And now you've got my wife.
Well, aren't you gonna stay and fight for me?
What's the use?
Hey, Anthony, come on, now, don't Have you ever had to defend Vera's honor?
Well, no, not per se.
But on more than one occasion I've held her place in line while she parked the car.
Could you believe that?
After I gave that man the best 28 months of my life.
Well, why don't you go catch up with him and patch things up.
Forget it.
He's a wimp and he can't get a job.
And his jealousy is ruining our marriage.
Not to mention that he left the cap off the toothpaste for, like, the kajillionth day in a row.
I had no idea that the wounds were so deep.
Well, as far as I'm concerned, he can just go and Oh, God!
I've just lost the only man I've ever loved.
Oh, no, wait.
Sit here, will ya?
Listen, he'll come back.
Don't you worry about that.
Now, he's not gonna leave a beautiful girl like you.
You really think so, Sam?
Oh, absolutely.
He'll be right back.
I mean, do you really think I'm beautiful?
Hey, anyone see the conclusion of the White House Murders last night?
No!
Don't say anything.
I've got it on tape.
Did you believe it was the vice-president?
Please!
How about where the First Lady popped out of a pool of her own blood and strangled the Russian ambassador?
No No Yeah, that was my reaction exactly.
Well, thank you, one and all, for ruining yet another plot for me.
I'll be off, now, but before I go there's something I'd like to share with you.
In Citizen Kane.
Rosebud is the name of his sled.
In Murder on the Orient Express, everyone did it, and Luke Skywalker's father is Darth Vader.
Ha!
Ah, why doesn't the guy tell us something we don't know, huh?
Darth Vader is Luke's father?
See you soon.
Bye.
"Bye".
How dare she put on that sweetness and light when it's so obvious she's nothing more than a sordid little harlot.
Hypocrite.
Doing a great job, Laurie.
Keep it up!
I need a couple of drafts, Sam.
Okay.
But, oh, you, uh, You and Anthony still not talking?
Talking?
I can barely stomach necking with him.
He's a wimp.
Not like my Sam.
Tell me, how do you feel about moonlit walks by the beach and dinner by a roaring fire?
I hate them.
I-I can't stand them.
Bleah.
Yay!
Me, too.
No, no, no.
I was kidding.
I love them.
Too late.
You know, if someone ran over Laurie in the parking lot, I bet it would look like an accident.
Do you want to make 500 bucks?
Just, don't Listen to yourself.
You're going crazy here.
We both have a problem with these new waitresses.
Why don't we help each other out, here?
Oh, like I scratch your back?
And I'll scratch your front.
What do you propose?
Well, all right, uh now, we don't know for sure that Laurie is Evan Drake's mistress, so why don't you let a guy who knows women better than they know themselves find out, all right?
Okay.
Laurie, you got a second here?
Yeah.
How do you feel about, uh moonlit walks on the beach with a dinner by a roaring fire?
Oh, I love those.
Well, would you like to join me?
Oh, no, no, but thanks for asking.
She's his mistress.
How do you know that?
She turned me down.
That just proves she has a weak stomach.
I'll handle this myself.
Oh, wait a second.
Wait a minute.
What about my little problem here, you know?
Sam, I don't have time to handle some silly little teenage crush.
It is not silly.
Oh, yes, Miss Howe?
Laurie, my, you are such a busy little bee.
I bet you just won't have an ounce of energy left for your leisure time.
Oh, that's okay.
I've lots of energy.
I'll bet you do.
You know, you and I really haven't had a chance to get to know each other.
What do you like to do in your leisure time?
Well, I, uh, I like to read.
In bed?
Sometimes.
What else do you like to do in bed?
Sleep.
Oh, well.
Let, let's imagine here, that you are asleep in bed, and you roll over.
Did you fall on the floor, or did something impede your progress?
Excuse me?
Oh, nothing.
It's must my warped, wonderful, wild sense of humor.
By the way, how do you know Evan Drake?
Well, he's uh a friend.
Oh.
Well, then maybe you could help me out.
I was gonna buy him a gift.
Perhaps you know what size he wears in slacks or shirts or jockey shorts.
Oh sure, but he doesn't wear jockeys.
He wears boxers.
Never mind, then.
I'm gonna pop her.
I'm gonna pop her.
I'm gonna pop her right in the kisser.
I'm gonna pop her!
Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop!
That's good.
Now-Now do, uh, bacon frying.
You know, Darth Vader cannot be Luke Skywalker's father.
They don't have the same last name.
That's right, Woody.
I'd better call out the Imperial Guards.
Stop it, Mr. Peterson.
You're scaring me.
You know, Sam, I was just thinking about us last night as I was in the tub shaving my legs and pumicing the dead skin off my knees and elbows and waxing my Uh, is-is there a point to this?
Do I have to say it?
Can't you just feel it?
Would you stop that?
This is silly.
Now, just Of course it's silly, but love is silly, isn't it?
Romeo and Juliet were silly in a mad, passionate way.
Are we silly, Sam?
Are we?
Y-You maybe, but I'm not.
Listen, young lady, I happen to be a very close friend of your mother-in-law, and out of respect, I'm ending this conversation right now.
You can end the conversation, Sam, but you can't end the feeling.
Honey, I'm flattered, but this is nuts.
I mean, I You know, I'm old enough to be your f a youthful uncle, all right?
I mean, when-when when I'm 60, you're-you're gonna be 22.
Oh, my God, that can't be right.
Uh all right, uh All right, when I'm 60, uh, well, you'll be looking pretty good, actually.
Um so, why don't you call me when I'm 60?
I can't wait that long.
Oh, don't.
Just  Hey, knock it off!
All right, you, outside.
You're gonna get what's coming to you.
I am not going outside with you, Anthony.
Not you.
Her.
I mean, come on.
You're twice as big as me.
Hey, but you stay away from her, if you know what's good for you.
Thank you for the warning.
Come on, Annie.
Let's go.
Why should I listen to you?
Because I happen to be the new Assistant Night Manager at Burger Burger Burger.
You got a job?
Hey, an important job.
When I tell people to chop lettuce, they say, "How high"?
And now, I am telling you, Missy, if you don't come with me this instant, we're through forever.
I am so totally turned on right now, I could spit.
Well, I guess it's true what they say: power is the ultimate aphrodisiac.
A uniform doesn't hurt, either.
Can you wear it all night?
Oh, maybe the hat.
Ooh.
Boy, Sam, lucky for you, he got that job, huh?
Lucky, hell.
I got him that job.
I traded in a few favors and got him in.
Wow.
As a matter of fact, are you interested in buying a secondhand car with this giant hamburger on top?
Five-speed or automatic?
Uh, Miss Howe?
Yes, Laurie, dear?
Well, uh, Mr. Drake is dropping by, and I was wondering if I could just break away for a for an early lunch.
Lunch.
Is that the fashionable term for it these days?
No, I think I've always called it lunch.
Well, you just run along with Mr. Drake to your lunch, and don't eat so much, you can't walk back.
Okay.
Excuse me, Sam.
What did she mean by that?
Oh, she's, uh, under a lot of pressure nowawdays.
I volunteered to help her release some of it, but she  Probably didn't help, by asking for an early break.
Mm.
I better apologize.
Oh, Normie, do my eyes deceive me, or is this the start of girl-fighting season?
Luckily, we have our, uh, luxury box seats just in time.
That's right.
They cost a little bit more, but they're worth it.
Miss Howe, if it's more convenient, I'll just take my lunch break one hour Listen!
Let's just cut the crap here, all right?
I know how you got hired here, and I know what your relationship is to Mr. Drake.
You do?
Well, give me credit for having an ounce of a brain.
You can tell me to go to hell, but there's something I have to know.
Do you love Evan Drake?
Well, yes.
I see.
: And does he love you?
Does he love you?
!
Well, of course he does.
Well, then there's only one thing left to say.
Oh, my God.
Oh!
Oh, damn, it's a knockout.
Didn't even get to any hair-pulling.
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.
What the hell's going on?
Mr. Drake.
Daddy.
D-Daddy?
Daddy?
Daddy.
Daddy.
What happened?
Oh, I think she hit me.
You hit my daughter?
No, I'm fine.
Yes, I did, but it was an accident.
I have a nerve disorder.
A nerve disorder?
Yes, she Yes.
She was dropped as a child on her  And-And you better stand back, because I just never know when it's gonna go off.
Ooh.
Oh!
Aah!
See?
I'd better get back on that medication.
Are you all right, baby?
I'll be all right.
Thank you.
I mean her.
Yes, Daddy.
Oh.
So, uh, Laurie's your daughter.
Why didn't you tell me, kiddo?
Well, Daddy said not to.
I didn't want her to have any special treatment.
I want her to know what it feels like not to be the boss's daughter.
What a fabulous idea.
And so smart of you not to tell anyone who she was.
Do you have any cotton in your office?
Yeah.
Let's put some food in my baby, huh?
Again, again, please accept my apology, and it was so nice to see you, Mr. Drake.
If you don't mind, I'll wait till after you've had the medication.
Do you think he bought that nerve disorder thing?
I think he bought that nerve disorder thing.
Is it getting darker in here?
Oh, Sam, stop being such a big baby.
Yeah, well Here, let me look at your nose.
Ow, ow, ow, ow.
: Oh, my God!
What?
Oh.
Huh?
What-What?
Hey, everybody, I'm back.
Hey, Carla.
All right.
Anything new since I've been gone?
Mm, no, not much.
Uh, well, nothing special.
Yeah, yeah.
How about yourself?
The usual.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
TV  English is, of course, a member of the Germanic sub-family of the Indo-European Isn't this fascinating?
Must be what TV's like after you're dead.
All right, Normie, turn off that claptrap.
The cavalry has arrived.
I just raided Vincent's Video Emporium for the finest '50s sci-fi fare.
All right.
Yeah, get ready for a rollicking evening of, uh, pod people, invisible monsters and wisecracking robots.
Ooh danger, danger!
Danger, danger!
I love this stuff.
Yeah?
Oh, now there's one of my favorites-- Invasion of the Body Snatchers.
All right.
Good one.
A particularly trenchant analysis of the collective American psyche during the Cold War era, with the pod people representing the dehumanizing effect of the McCarthy hearings.
I guess we got, uh, plenty of other movies there.
Here we go.
Day the Earth Stood Still-- a real classic.
Oh Klaatu barada nicto  For my money, the finest allegorical retelling of the life of Christ on film.
Even better than E.T. Next batter.
Forbidden Planet.
Well, that's a good choice.
It's a witty revamp of Shakespeare's The Tempest with Robbie the Robot standing in for the sprite Ariel.
Well, so what'll it be?
TV  This, then, was the height of the literary use of Middle English.
By the end of  Making your way in the world today Takes everything you've got Taking a break from all your worries Sure would help a lot Wouldn't you like to get away?
Sometimes you want to go Where everybody knows your name And they're always glad you came You want to be where you can see Our troubles are all the same You want to be where everybody knows your name You want to go where people know People are all the same You want to go where everybody knows your name.
Look, are you sure?
Check out Mr. Evan Drake over there, acting like he owns the place, eh?
Thinks that he's just some, uh, big shot corporate executive, eh?
Doesn't have to pay attention to the common man like you and me?
We're not important enough.
Well, actually, Cliff, if it helps to alleviate this envy that seems to be eating you up right now, studies have shown that rich people are than most of us.
Oh, come on, that's a crock.
Well, of course it is, but we have to cling to it, don't we?
Thank you.
Damn.
Bad news?
Yeah, a very important client and I were going to take the corporate yacht out for a little cruise, but he had to hurry home.
Illness in the family?
No, they overthrew his government.
Ah, on the weekend, to boot, huh?
Just can't make plans with dictators.
Sam, why don't you join me?
We're heading out to Martha's Vineyard.
Oh, I'd love to.
Why don't we make it a romantic weekend, huh?
Oh, well, I'm flattered, Evan, that's : No, no, no, no.
I meant bring Rebecca along.
Rebecca?
Why would I want to do that?
Well, the last I heard, you two were a hot item.
Uh, well, uh I'm not going to hear any more about it.
I don't know, man No, no, no.
You two are coming.
Now, just call my secretary.
She'll give you all the details, all right?
Oh, Mr. Drake?
Hmm.
Um, I'm an insignificant cog in the vast machinery of your corporation.
Nice to meet you.
You being a rich and powerful guy, you might think you'd let yourself get all fat and lazy, but you look like you keep yourself in pretty good shape.
Well, I get to the gym a few times a week.
Good, good, then maybe you can catch the truck that's towing your Rolls.
I love to see rich people haul butt.
Well, let's see here.
What little mermaid would like me to scale her tail this weekend?
What, you're not taking Miss Howe?
No, I thought I'd have fun instead.
I'm tired of barking up that tree.
I thought Mr. Drake told you to take her.
Well, I'll just, uh, tell him we broke up, or something.
Besides  I got this, uh, gorgeous dental hygienist that I've been trying to impress, and flossing every day just isn't doing it.
She'll love this yacht thing.
She's, uh, into money in a big way.
It's amazing how superficial some people can be, isn't it?
Oh, tell me about it.
Good thing for her she's got a great set of hooters.
Good luck.
Mmm, thank you.
Hold it, hold it hold it, hold it, hold Look, no, I'm telling you, Normie, recent research into the Revolutionary War indicates that the, uh, defenders of this area were not called the, uh, Minutemen after all.
Oh, like every history book is then wrong, right?
Oh, they were actually called the Minute Men.
A lot of them under three feet tall, as a matter of fact.
Right.
Way back in history, people were shorter.
All right, fine.
Take, for example, the, uh, the Knights of the Round Table.
Yeah?
Genuine midgets.
You're a very lonely man, aren't you?
Julie, sweetheart, come on, it's the middle of winter.
You're going to have to bundle up.
I don't know, pack a wool bikini, or something.
All right.
: Okay, bye-bye.
Whee.
All right.
Julie is set.
Sammy, come here.
Let me see if I got this straight.
What?
Drake invited you and Rebecca.
Mm-hmm.
Uh, Rebecca's got the major hots for Drake.
You take Julie instead of Rebecca.
Rebecca is left standing alone on the dock.
Hey, what's that in her hand?
Oh, must be your severed head.
Uh, don't worry about it.
Rebecca's not even going to find out she was invited.
Well, Sam, looks like we're going to be shipmates.
What do you mean?
I just saw Evan outside, and he told me the good news.
I'm going to be your date.
Uh, well, here uh here's the bad news.
I've already invited somebody else.
Un-invite her.
Sam, I have been dying for this chance to get to know Evan in a social setting.
He only sees me as some tough businesswoman in tailored suits.
I want him to see me in sportswear.
No you don't understand.
See, Julie is really important to me.
I've been working like crazy to-to set something up with her for almost three days now.
All right, all right.
I'll, uh, I'll call Evan and I'll try to fix it up.
I what am how am I going to explain Julie tagging along?
Oh, I don't know.
Tell him she's your sister.
My sister?
Rebecca, this is a hot, gorgeous, sexy woman.
Yeah, he'll believe that.
Oh, this looks just marvelous, Lorenzo, just marvelous.
Grazie, signore.
Thanks again, Evan, for, uh, making room for my sister here on such short notice.
Yeah, I really appreciate that.
This yacht must have cost a fortune!
Mmm.
Well, did it?
Well, the important thing is that it gets me where I want to go.
Ah.
Yep.
All I really need is a boat beneath my feet and a star to guide her with.
And of course, a helicopter pad.
Oh, you have a beautiful laugh, Julie.
Doesn't she brighten up the old tub, Lorenzo?
It is like a ray of sunshine to have a woman as beautiful as Miss Malone onboard.
Oh, and of course you, too.
Oh, yeah, yeah, of course.
Oh, thank you, Mr. Drake, it's nice Wow, you must be very proud of your brother.
He was one heck of a pitcher, I'll tell you.
It's too bad he's not playing now, when he could be making some real money.
Isn't she sweet?
You two are very close, aren't you?
Mm.
Oh, yeah.
She's, um, like a sister to me.
I'm afraid I didn't have much in common with my brother.
Oh, you, too-- same with my brother.
Julie, you told me you didn't have another brother.
Well Uh, well she doesn't, actually, but I do.
Well, well, it's not actually his brother.
They're just such close friends that Sam likes to think of him as his brother.
We just don't have anything in common, that's all.
Everything is ready, sir.
Ah.
Ah.
Hey!
Everyone help themselves here.
I have to have a word with the chef.
Hey, I have three for him, "Keep it coming".
Whoo!
You know, this is kind of fun, pretending to have this whole different personality.
If you like it, you might want to get one of your own.
Wow, would you look at this.
Lobster, cracked crab, caviar Hey, ham.
Whoo!
I wonder what this spread cost.
You know, Julie, you seem very concerned with the price of things.
Don't you find that a little rude?
Well, it's not like I asked him how old he is.
What do you think?
Find anything to your liking?
Actually, yes.
So have I.  So I guess your cabin is that, uh, really big one upstairs, huh?
Uh-huh.
Ah, I'd really like to see it.
Well, maybe I could take you on the captain's tour right after dinner.
Oh, I'd really like that.
Do you think your brother would mind?
What brother?
Ah.
Great.
Tonight is the night.
Yeah.
I can feel it in my bones.
Right after dinner, I'm gonna tell Evan how I really feel.
Mmm.
No, I'm gonna show him how I feel.
I'm going to seize the moment.
Fine, do what you want.
Right about then, I'm going to be seizing Julie's headboard.
Well  May I propose a toast?
Oh, yeah.
Yes.
To a night full of promise and possibilities.
Hear, hear.
Hear, hear.
Hear, hear, yeah.
Well, I hope Lorenzo has seen to everything.
Julie, this is your cabin.
I hope you find it comfortable.
Thank you.
I'll check in on you later, sis.
Oh, uh, that's okay.
I think I'm getting a headache.
Well, not to worry.
I'll just drop by with the old family cure.
Your cabin, you two.
Ah.
Good night.
Good night.
Sleep tight.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
I'm sure you don't have bedbugs on this boat, or any other kind of bugs.
Do they even have bugs at sea?
Well, maybe water bugs Good night.
What is my problem?
Huh?
Every time I talk to him, I sound like a complete idiot.
Sam?
Mm-hmm.
Did you ever get tongue-tied with a woman?
Oh, sure, lots of times.
As a matter of fact, once we had to go to the emergency room.
They do have bugs at sea.
Oh, now Hey, this is a great room, isn't it?
Too bad I won't be using it.
Yeah, well, if I get lucky, I won't, either.
Sam, do you have to do that in front of me?
What?
Oh, I'm sorry, but Julie's a dental hygienist.
This is gonna be the first thing she checks.
Maybe the second.
You know, I love it when you talk stupid, Sam.
Uh-huh.
Didn't she just say she had a headache?
No, no.
For Evan's benefit.
No, she's got the kind of headache where you go straight to bed and take a couple of Sammys every four hours.
God, I cannot believe I'm sharing a stateroom with you.
I will never get any mirror time.
All right, all right.
Thank you.
Just Oh, what can I get you?
Well, let's see.
Uh, today's my birthday.
What's a good birthday drink?
Oh, well, Sam always buys a free beer for people on their birthday.
Hey, that's great.
Uh, actually, it's, uh, my girlfriend here's birthday, too.
Oh, well, she gets a free beer, too, then.
Funny thing is, it's our birthday, also.
Oh, yeah, that's how we all met.
We were, uh, at the same party.
Wow.
Free beers all around then, huh?
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey, there, Mr. Hoof and Mouth, will you put your thinking cap on?
Hey, what are the chances of those four people having a birthday on the same day?
The odds must be astronomical.
I'm just glad I was here to see it.
Hey, hey Woody, Woody, Woody, Woody Don't you think it's the slightest bit of a coincidence that those four people happen to have the exact same birthday as Cliff and me?
Really?
A pitcher will be fine.
Yeah.
Two.
You've been working on your hair all this time, and it still looks like that?
Like what?
Like something you'd surf on.
Well Give me the brush.
Get down.
All right.
God am I really gonna have the guts to go through with this?
Yes, I am.
I have to.
And now There you go.
Yeah, that's great.
This is really going to be tricky tonight.
Yeah.
I have to create just the right romantic mood with Evan.
Yeah.
Do you have any suggestions on how I could do that?
Oh, yeah, that's easy.
What you do  is you knock on his door, and you tell him that you're having trouble sleeping, that you need some air.
And then you get him to take a little stroll around the deck with you, and then when the the moment's right, you tell him you'd like to see him naked.
Works for me.
Yeah.
I'm out of here.
Okay.
Good luck.
I-I was just heading up on deck.
I was just going up on deck, too.
I just changed my mind.
I just changed my mind, too.
Whoa-ho!
That was quick.
Was it everything you thought it'd be?
Sam, don't be stupid.
All right, here I go.
Go on.
I changed my mind, decided to get some fresh air.
Me, too.
Oh, but I forgot my So did I. Would you do something about that damn Julie?
What?
She keeps heading up on deck every time I open up the door.
Julie?
What the hell's she doing?
We got a date.
That would probably send me to the rail, too.
Here I go again.
You ready for the Captain's tour?
Oh, I don't know.
I don't think I'm dressed for it.
Maybe you could help me pick out something.
Oh, my God!
What?
I just saw Evan go in Julie's cabin, and my life has no meaning.
You're crazy.
I'm not, I saw it.
Shoot me now!
: J-Julie?
Uh, Sam, I told you I have a headache.
Oh, wait a minute.
What?
Hey, Drake's in there, isn't he?
Oh.
Oh.
Well I don't believe this.
What?
You're-You're throwing me over for that guy?
Why?
Just because he has more money than me?
More money than I'll ever hope to have?
More money than most of America h?
I'm losing this argument, aren't I?
Good night.
Okay.
I don't believe the nerve of that woman.
I believe it.
Of course I believe it.
Because she is nothing more than a classless bimbo.
Hey, don't defend her to me.
To think, you know, I have wasted three days on that lost cause.
Three days?
!
Try wasting two years.
Two years of waiting by the phone for him to call.
Two years of making excuses for why he didn't.
Two years of dreaming about him and thinking about him.
Living every moment for Evan Gregory Drake.
Wow.
Boy, you sure have me beat.
I'm just so disappointed in him.
Disappointed?
Think how I feel.
I mean, he's in there boinking my sister.
Oh.
I am never gonna have a husband or babies.
Oh, now Or a family.
All I have is my stupid career, : and I don't even like it.
Hey, come on now.
Listen, you-you are a-a beautiful, intelligent woman.
Oh, Sam, please, not now.
What?
Oh, come on.
What-What you think that I'm?
Listen, I made a lot of stupid passes at you, but this is not one of them.
Hey  you are a terrific person.
You know, a lot of good things are gonna happen, and I'm sure the right person's gonna come along.
Well, what if he already did, and I didn't know it : because of Evan?
Well, then, if you miss him, then he wasn't the right person.
Oh.
Really?
Yeah, really.
Really?
Uh-oh.
Um listen you're in a very, uh emotional state right now, and I I don't want to take advantage of that.
If you want me to leave, you just say so.
I don't seem to be saying anything.
Oh Oh, I'm sorry.
No, it's all right, Evan, come in.
Well, I can't sleep until I get something off my chest.
Well, read a book, man, and-and get back to us in about three hours, huh?
No, no.
Go on, Evan.
Sam I got where I am in life because I have always dealt honestly with people I respect.
Hey, that's great.
Can we talk about it in the morning, please?
Sam, I tried to seduce your sister.
Oh, oh, oh Oh, well, that's a that's a shocker.
Um, may maybe we ought to sleep on it, huh?
Sam, please, give me my day in court, will you?
You see, I Well, since my marriage broke up, I have been feeling lonely.
Still, a man gets urges.
Mm.
But I guess I'm just too old-fashioned to think I can find any real happiness that way.
Nothing happened, Sam.
Oh And I just wanted to explain that to you, so, uh Uh, excuse me.
Well Good night.
Yeah, yeah, good night.
: All right.
Now All right, okay.
Where were we here?
I have never loved that man more than I do right at this very minute.
Me, neither.
So where were we?
God, he needs someone so badly.
Oh, come on!
I haven't used that "men have urges" line since I was in the fifth grade.
Excuse me, Sam.
What?
Come on!
What are you gonna do?
You gonna go chasing after him?
No, no, no.
Please.
It isn't the right time.
I just have to think.
I'm gonna go up on deck and sleep and look at the stars.
Uh, li-listen, you can't  You can't just work me up like that, and then walk out of here.
Please.
Sam No, please.
I believe you have a sister with a vacancy sign on her door.
Right, right.
Say hello to the stars for me there, sweetheart.
Boy, this Okay, all right.
: Um, Julie?
: Listen, uh, why don't we let bygones be bygones here?
Um, you were tempted, I was tempted, but what the hell?
We're both consenting adults, huh?
I sure hope there's, uh, some room in that bunk of yours for me.
There isn't.
I got to stay off boats, man.
Hello.
Hey, Carla.
Did you pick your mother-in-law up?
Yeah.
I tried to pawn her off on some Hare Krishnas, but I think she's the only thing they won't take at the airport.
So, how's it been going?
Oh, fine.
Well, they tried to pull that old birthday gag where they get a free round of beers, but I caught on after the fifth round.
Oh, Gomer, Gomer, Gomer.
Geez!
Well, lucky for me, I remembered that Mr. Clavin and Mr. Peterson already had their birthday.
Those foam suckers were in on this?
!
That does it.
Where are they?
Hey, hey, hey.
I want to talk to you.
Nobody stiffs this bar.
Oh Oh  You owe me for five rounds.
Hey, come here.
Ooh.
All right, Cliffie, we split up.
There's no way she can catch both of us.
Norm-Norm, she's she's gonna come after me first, Normie.
Yeah.
Ready?
No, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no.
No.
Get back here.
Get Oh, oh.
Ooh, ooh.
Hey!
Where's the tip?
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
Come in.
Mind if I use your office?
Again?
Hey, you think I like having to do this?
You know how hard it is to breast-feed twins?
I haven't had my bra off and on this much since junior high.
Hey.
Maybe you could help.
What do you mean "help"?
Well, you got a decent set of ducts.
Maybe I could use you as a decoy.
You see?
While I'm pumping one kid, the other one's attached to you.
Are you serious?
Sure!
It'll shut 'em up.
So they won't get milk.
Life is hard.
Making your way in the world today Takes everything you've got Taking a break from all your worries Sure would help a lot Wouldn't you like to get away?
Sometimes you want to go Where everybody knows your name And they're always glad you came You want to be where you can see Our troubles are all the same You want to be where everybody knows your name You want to go where people know People are all the same You want to go where everybody knows your name.
Good evening, everyone!
Hello.
You know, it's uncanny, my darling, but there's not a room you step foot into where you're not the most beautiful woman there.
That's deplorable sentence structure, Frasier.
What you mean to say is that I am the most beautiful woman in any room I enter.
Yes.
Well, thank you for correcting me in front of 30 people.
There you go, your usual cured spritzer.
Thanks, Sam.
Hey, the big day is around the corner, isn't it?
Yeah, next Saturday.
Lilith and I have been in the process of writing, editing, rewriting, and researching our wedding vows.
Hi, boss.
Hiya.
Hello, Rebecca.
I have a small favor to ask regarding our impending wedding.
Since all my close friends will be out of town, and we have had a previous conversation, and our eyes have met on a number of occasions, I was wondering if you'd consent to be my maid of honor.
Me?
Isn't that usually your best friend?
You are my best friend.
Oh, I'm very flattered.
Um I guess so.
Sure, Lila.
Lilith.
Right.
Right.
I knew that.
Let's discuss wedding gowns.
Do you think black Sam, it, uh, goes without saying of course, that you'll be my best man.
Aw, I-I don't want to do that.
It makes me feel so uncomfortable.
I mean, a best man has to give a toast, doesn't he?
No, look, I-I took the liberty of writing down a few things.
Then I'd be honored.
Oh, that's great.
: What are you doing for a bachelor party?
Oh, actually, I haven't any plans.
Well, would you like to have one tonight?
Well, what do you think, darling?
Uh, would I like a bachelor party?
Well while I feel that particular ritual is as passé as taking the topknot of one's dead enemy, I will not deprive you of the experience.
Immature though it might be.
She's a gamer!
Oh!
We're on!
Fellas, stag party tonight.
Hey!
All right.
You know, uh, being maid of honor means you have to throw Brunehilda a bridal shower.
Oh, right.
I guess I should do something.
What kind of shower do you think?
Kitchen?
Linen?
Look at who she's hitching up with.
Better make it marital aids.
I'll handle this.
Uh, Lilith?
What do you say we have a little get-together at my place tonight?
That would be lovely.
Now, you're gonna have to tell me who to invite, because I don't know anything about you.
I only wish there were some way I could repay you, Rebecca.
Oh, don't mention it.
If you ever need to admit a family member to a mental institution, I could certainly speed up the paperwork.
That's very dear of you.
Well, gents Yep.
My last night of freedom.
Yep.
One last chance to loosen the old noose, so to speak.
Really have some fun while I still can.
Do I hear the pitter-patter of cold feet?
No!
No!
Not at all.
I mean, as long as I'm in love with this woman and she has my dear old mother tied up in the cellar, I'm gonna go through with it.
Darling could I speak with you a moment?
Excuse me.
The ball and chain.
Frasier, do you realize that is the fourth derogatory remark about marriage you've made this evening?
Oh, come on, my angel.
I mean, they're they're jokes.
I mean, everybody knows my mother is dead.
That's what makes it funny.
No one loves a good joke more than I. But I find that-- as our wedding day approaches-- the frequency of these quips has increased.
Are you having second thoughts?
Well, only that I love you more now than I did five minutes ago.
Leaving aside your schoolboy sophistries, let me make you an offer.
If, after your madcap night of debauchery and vomiting, you still feel you want to go through with the wedding plans, call me and tell me so.
But Lilith, that's entirely unnecessary.
I beg to differ.
Up until this point, you've only seen my warm and vulnerable side.
Now I must become cold and analytical.
As if you could, my treasure.
Frasier, I need your reassurance.
I'll be awaiting your call.
Boy, this bachelor party should be keen.
"Keen"?
Hey, I don't know about Indiana, but around here when guys get together to send another guy off to his doom, things can get a little raunchy, you hear me?
You fellas ever dress up farm animals in women's clothing?
No.
Well, then I'm one up on you.
Gentlemen!
You know, I, I was listening to a rock and roll station on my way over here, and you know, to put me in the mood.
There was a passage in one of those tribal songs that I feel, uh well, is the keynote for this evening.
"Everybody have fun tonight".
"Everybody Wang Chung tonight".
Yeah, I think we got a madman on our hands here.
I had a nap.
You know, gentlemen I I can't tell you how touched I am that you all-- to a man-- came back for my party.
We never left.
Boy, this is gonna be some night.
Oh, a real guy night.
Yeah!
Check your X chromosome at the door.
I wonder what the women are doing?
Oh, they're probably, uh, hanging around, drinking some European coffee you know, mocha Finland or the like, eh.
Passing around a bunch of brownies, saying, "No, I really shouldn't," and then stuffing their faces.
To the man of the hour, huh?
Mr. Frasier Crane, and to all the girls we've loved before.
Hear!
Hear!
I've, uh loved quite a few.
How 'bout a fill-up, huh?
Cliffie.
A big difference between loving women and annoying them in the checkout line, okay?
Ah, women.
They're tough to figure out.
Yeah, but they're sure fun to play with while you're trying.
If you guys could have one woman, any woman in the world, who would it be?
Oh, that's easy.
Kathleen Turner.
Wah-wah-wah-wah!
Give me Kim Basinger in 9 1/2 Weeks.
Ten weeks.
Ten weeks.
Jill Eikenberry.
You know, L.A. Law?
She's married to that short, dumpy guy on the show.
Something about her, I like.
Lilith Sternin.
Loni Anderson.
Boy, she's got a set of oompahs that John Phillip Sousa would kill for.
I swear to God.
My very first time was in the sixth grade.
School crossing guard.
No!
Hey, I swear to you.
Wow, that's more exciting than my first time.
Wedding night, Norm?
Uh, the following week.
Yeah.
Hey, hey, good news, guys.
Wife says I don't have to go home till midnight.
Ooh, yeah.
The bad news is, she'll still be awake when you get there.
Eh, I don't know.
Women, women.
You know, uh, once they get their claws in you, they just don't let go, you know what I mean?
Oh, I don't know, Cliff.
I wouldn't say that about all women.
I'm sure Loni Anderson doesn't do that.
And I know my Lilith.
Why, just today, she presented me with an opportunity to back out of the marriage if I so desire.
Now, is that blind faith or what?
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh, what?
Seems to me that she might have changed her mind and is just trying to let you down easy.
That's the most preposterous thing I've ever heard.
Oh, I don't know, now.
If you had a 200-pound marlin, and you're about haul him on the boat, would you stop and ask him if he wanted to go back in the water?
Be careful, Dr. Crane.
This could be a trick question.
I think the laws are different in each state.
Well, I-I certainly don't believe that's true in Lilith's case.
I don't know, Frase, Sammy could have a point there.
Do you really think Lilith wants me to back out?
Could be.
Could be.
I'd think about it, Doc.
Well, then let's just see how the night progresses.
Maybe Lilith Sternin will get her wish, after all.
Where's that stripper?
Let's get Bubbles or Peaches, or whatever her name is out here and have at her!
No, you, uh, you stay right there.
Yeah.
We are amused.
Whoo!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Karen!
Dr. Crane!
You know each other?
She's one of my patients.
Karen, I hope you're doing this for the money, because this certainly won't square things between you and your father.
I'm sorry I spoiled your party.
Oh, nonsense, Karen, you didn't spoil anything.
And under the circumstances, : we understand, don't we, guys?
There, you see?
Well, bye-bye, now.
Bye-bye.
Maybe I shouldn't get married.
Oh, come on, what are you talking about?
Oh, it's time I realized that there are two Frasier Cranes.
Frasier the prospective groom who sent Karen on her way, and Frasier the pig who wanted to see her shake her nonnies.
You know, I've never revealed this to anybody, but when Diane left me at the altar, I well, there was a tiny voice that kept saying, "You're off the hook, you're off the hook".
Yeah, the only voice I heard was Vera's just yapping and yapping.
You ever notice it's always the women who want to get married?
Yapping and yapping.
Well, you know, when I think of all the unhappy people whom I've counseled over the years, whose lives have been scarred and destroyed by marriages badly cast, I could write a book.
I have written a book.
Come on, now, Fras.
You're just having last-minute jitters.
Geez, I-I don't know.
Maybe Lilith isn't the woman for me.
What do you think of her, guys?
Tell me, listen, I-I-I demand complete honesty.
Well, uh, Doc, I'll be honest with you.
: Uh, ixnay, ixnay.
Oh, no, Normie, no, I just wish that I was there for you.
No, uh I was, uh, waiting for you to wise up, there, Doc.
You know, I mean, Lilith Sternin-- I mean, even the name makes the old butt cheeks, uh, tighten up, you know what I mean?
I mean, she is Olive Oyl without the good fashion sense.
And that personality, geez Hey, whoa, whoa, come on, hey, Cliff, that's enough.
Yeah, you think so?
Yeah, yeah.
All right.
Sam, you know, you've been uncharacteristically mute.
I mean, surely you have some opinion on this.
No, no, do it, man.
I think you should walk off together into the sunset, you know?
Live happily ever after.
Translation: Frasier Crane, you're a complete fool if you get married.
I did not say that.
Now, listen, Sam, I know exactly what you're thinking.
I mean, every fiber of your body speaks it.
You live it every day.
Give me one good reason why the single life is better than being married.
Okay, uh well, let's see.
When I get home, I don't have to explain to anybody uh, where I've been or what I've been doing.
If I was out having a good time, I don't have to call home to see if I can stay later.
Oh, that reminds me.
There, right there.
There you go.
See, that's what you're losing, man-- your freedom.
You know, I can eat doughnuts for dinner if I want to.
Nobody nags me to put down the toilet seat.
I am the king of my own remote control.
I can date anybody I want to, and if somebody better turns up-- and somebody always does, bless their hearts-- then I can date them the very next night.
You know, I don't have to worry about forgetting an anniversary, no mother-in-laws, no father-in-laws, no laws, period.
I only asked for one reason.
My God.
I'm, I'm actually beginning to have doubts.
No.
You know, I've got to hear the voice of my beloved just to reassure me.
Uh, Woody, Woody, give me Rebecca's number, and hand me the phone, would you?
Oh, Dr. Crane, if Miss Howe answers, could you ask her something for me?
What's that, Wood?
Ask her if she has Prince Albert in a can.
Don't tell her it was me.
No.
Hello.
Yeah, h-hello.
Is that you, Carla?
Yeah, yeah, who is it?
Uh, it's Frasier.
What's all that noise?
What's going on over there?
We're making a quilt.
Well, can I speak to Lilith, please?
Well, is it important?
She's showing the male stripper where to put his things.
What?
Oh, I-I got to get back.
I-I got a bet this guy's packing socks.
She'll call you back sometime.
What happened?
Oh, nothing.
Seems Lilith is indisposed at the moment.
She's helping to undress a male stripper.
A male stripper?
Well, where do they put the tassels?
The thought of my Lilith having one last carnal fling with some fellow in a Speedo is beyond belief!
Now, Frasier, I mean, just 'cause some guy strips in her honor doesn't mean they're going to wind up in the sack together.
Oh, no, no, no, you don't know my Lilith.
I'll tell you, once her libido's cut loose, I mean, there's no tying her down, unless, of course, that's what she's into for the evening.
She's, right now, she's with him.
Oh, no, hey, hey, come on, take it easy here.
She's with that man-- that sweating, chiseled, Frasier.
pulsing, throbbing Hey, hey, whoa.
sexy Creme de Menthe?
You couldn't find some water?
My God, Sam.
You realize what this this means?
Well, I-I don't know the clinical term for it, but it seems to me you were going a little scooters there.
I was jealous, Sam.
I-I was insanely, blindly jealous.
If ever I needed a clearer gut-level demonstration of my feelings, I mean, that was it.
Yes, yes, it's perverted.
Yes, it's childish, but yes, it's love.
Maybe you ought to go see her right now.
I will, Sam.
There's just one matter that has to be rectified first.
Cliff, in light of my recent decision, I now take offense at your remarks about Lilith.
In short, I'm going to kick your sorry butt.
Ah, now, come on, Doc, just cool down, will you?
It was just a joke.
Oh, you mean like that costume you wear every day?
Whoa!
All right, put up your dukes, Dr. Cream Puff.
Okay, now we got a party, eh?
All right, all right, uh, before we start, let's just, uh, set a few ground rules, all right?
Uh, no punching in the face because that can cause severe brain damage.
Oh, oh, all right, uh, just one other thing.
Uh, no hitting below the belt.
I'm about to be married.
Uh, all right, all right, fair enough, fair enough.
All right, well, no hitting in the, uh, right shoulder, though.
That's my bag shoulder, all right?
What about the, um, upper thigh area?
Uh Oh, no, I think we covered that on page five over here.
Yeah.
Well, then, where does that leave us?
I don't know; it's leaving me with writer's cramp, I'll tell you.
Well, let that be a lesson to you.
As for me, I'm going to go back to my beloved, throw my arms around her milky-white shoulders, and let me tell you something, fellas.
I'm going to tell her I'm devoted to her, and that I'm dedicating the rest of my life to her.
Hello, everyone.
Frasier, is that you?
Good.
I hope this doesn't spoil the bachelor party, but the engagement is off.
It's over, history, kaput.
Good night.
What?
!
She's kind of juiced.
I can't be engaged to you, Frasier, because I'm marrying Randy here.
If anyone wants to get us a wedding gift, his butt is this size.
Why don't you sit down, Dr. Sternin?
Oh, "Dr. Sternin" is a little formal, isn't it?
You can call me Sheena, Ruler of the Jungle of Love.
Can somebody sober her up?
Hey, I think you lost a button.
We'll handle it from here.
Thanks, Randy.
Happy to do it.
There's still the matter of cab fare.
Oh.
Here, there you go.
Great.
Thanks.
See you.
Oh, Randy, don't leave me.
I'll never be able to hear "Shock the Monkey" again without crying.
Lilith, what were you thinking of?
!
I'm sorry, Frasier, it's just that I felt the need to get back at you.
I waited all evening for you to call and say that the wedding was still on, but you didn't, you cur.
I did call!
Didn't Carla tell you?
She was too busy licking Bosco off Randy's chest.
I became increasingly more distraught and foolish as the night grew long.
Of course, the 11 tequila shooters didn't help.
And now, the epilogue is that my behavior has probably cost me the one man I truly love.
Oh, you can probably still catch him.
Woody, I don't think you're following along closely enough.
Listen, you're not the only one who's behaved irrationally tonight.
Lilith I want to marry you anyway.
You do?
Absolutely.
For the rest of my life, I will always cherish those words: "Lilith, I want to marry you anyway".
Come, my sweet.
Let's get on with our life together.
Uh, thank you all.
: Yeah, way to go, Doc.
Good night, Doc.
See you, Doc.
Oh, Lilith, just, uh promise me two things.
Never leave me for another, and uh don't throw up on me in the cab.
Well, guys, what do you think?
What'll we do now, huh?
I got to get home.
Yeah, I got to tell my wife, too.
Yeah, I'm out of here, too.
Me, too.
Good night, Sam.
Good night, Sam.
Yeah.
Hey, that reminds me.
I promised Vera I'd pick up some Chinese food.
Oh, that's nice of you, Norm.
Well, I spilled it on the floor this morning.
Yeah, well, I'll be saying good night there, Sammy.
I, uh, I am married to the U.S. Postal Service.
What the hell, Sammy, we all can't lead your carefree life.
Well, good night.
Yeah.
Oh, boy.
Party's over?
Yeah.
They all had women they had to run home to.
Saps.
I just came back to lock up.
Oh, come on, hey, I always do that.
Oh, that's right.
You're a real night owl, aren't you?
Yeah.
One of the great joys of being single.
You don't have to tell me.
Those women at the shower-- they have no idea how to have fun.
Five minutes after Randy left, we got into this heated debate about which was better, mayonnaise or Miracle Whip.
Turned into a fistfight.
Ha!
Ah, that's pathetic.
Boy, you know, I'll never trade in the single life.
Me, neither.
Good night, Sam.
Yeah, good night.
Ah.
Freedom.
You want to go get a cup of coffee?
Oh, you bet I do.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
No, no, it's a well-documented fact that the female of the species is irresistibly drawn to men in uniform.
Yeah, just yesterday, some lonely, frustrated housewife saw me coming up the garden path, you know, peeking through the window, and she tries to coyly titillate me by pulling down the shade so I wonder what's going on behind it.
Let me dispel the mystery.
She was puking.
Carla, don't you get bored just hanging around here all day waiting to take cheap shots at me?
Yeah, I should get a beeper.
All right, look.
That's it.
I am sick and tired of being your whipping boy.
Today the worm turns.
You are not going to insult me any longer, because I am not going to give you the chance.
As of from right now, I am shutting up, zipping my lip.
And my friends support me.
Making your way in the world today Takes everything you've got Taking a break from all your worries Sure would help a lot Wouldn't you like to get away?
Sometimes you want to go Where everybody knows your name And they're always glad you came You want to be where you can see Our troubles are all the same You want to be where everybody knows your name You want to go where people know People are all the same You want to go where everybody knows your name.
You know something, chaps, I had a particularly fascinating session this morning.
No, honestly.
Someone I was seeing for the first time.
Extraordinarily beautiful, young woman, who's uh, rather unique malaise is to be aroused with sexual frenzy by Oh, good Lord.
Excuse me.
I don't really think I should be discussing my patients here.
Uh how about discussing them over here?
Well, I suppose it wouldn't violate any doctor-patient confidentiality if I don't use names.
Pour the beer, Woody.
I thought you weren't going to use any names, Dr. Crane.
Woody Well, it seems this woman has her passions inflamed by men who dance.
Wait a minute, Wait a minute.
Men who dance?
That's weird.
What's even more bizarre, is that she will catapult herself compulsively into the arms of any man in tights or tap shoes.
Fascinating fixation.
Huh.
Ooh, geez.
I've got to go.
I'm sorry.
Where you going?
My ballet class.
No, no, lunch, lunch.
That was a little psychological humor.
You know, as my old professor used to say, if you can't laugh at your patients, what fun are they?
See you later.
Norm.
Morning, everybody.
Norm!
Can I pour you a draft, Mr. Peterson?
A little early, isn't it, Woody?
For a beer?
No, for stupid questions.
Pour.
Would you believe the board of directors is asking for a breakdown of projected earnings for the next six months?
Yes.
Rebecca, I started painting Mr. Drake's house.
I want to thank you for that recommendation.
Oh, it was my pleasure, Norm.
How's it going?
Great, great.
He's out of town for a few days so, uh, I thought it'd be a good time to get started in his bedroom.
I was doing a little prep work over there this morning, and I must say, that's a cute photo of you he has next to his night stand there.
What?
Just kidding.
I will kill you, Norm.
You know, uh, I am over there all by myself, so if you want to drop by and, uh, check any of the house out, I can get you in.
No I can't.
Oh, go on.
You're dying to look in his drawers.
That's right, he won't be there.
The last thing on my mind is Evan Drake and where he sleeps.
No, I don't want to be distracted.
I've got to get these figures into the bed of directors board of directors.
Shall we say in one hour?
I'll be there.
Excuse me, I'm looking for Dr. Crane.
He mentioned he'd be here.
Oh, I'm sorry, you just missed him.
Oh, darn.
I had a session earlier today and left a package in his office.
When I went back, it was locked.
Gee, I don't know what to tell you.
But then again, I don't know what to tell most people.
Uh, excuse me.
Uh, you had a session with him?
Are you a patient of his?
That's right.
Why?
Oh, just curious.
Well, it's not that important.
I just thought if I caught him, I could still get my package back.
I understand perfectly.
Well, I'm out of luck, I guess.
I'll just have to stop by tomorrow.
Gotta dance, gotta dance Why are you doing that?
This?
Oh  I guess it's kind of an old reflex with us hoofers.
Oh.
You're a dancer?
Well, kind of.
Yeah my name's Sam Malone but people call me Bojangles.
Jennifer McCall.
Jennifer McCall, whoo That's a beautiful name for a beautiful girl.
Well, thank you.
I have to be going.
Well, at least let me, uh, waltz you to the door here, all right?
I know I'm not very sophisticated, but I don't think what Sam is doing is right.
Well, look, don't you put yourself down with me, and I happen to agree with you.
I mean, standing around tending bar all day is like the worst thing a dancer could do for his calves.
Speaking of calves, Woody, was it painful when the cow kicked you in the head?
You get used to it.
Why don't I stop back and um, we'll go to lunch.
Oh, I'm looking forward to it already.
Ow, got a cramp.
Oh, God Ow, Woody And, uh, here's his bedroom.
I feel kind of queasy.
Like I don't belong here.
Like I'm doing something wrong.
I know-- that's how I feel in my bedroom.
I just feel kind of like I'm trespassing.
Like I'm invading his privacy.
This is not right.
This is not right.
I should not be doing this.
I shouldn't.
I shouldn't, I shouldn't.
Would you like to be alone?
Sorry.
Well, as long as I'm here, I guess it wouldn't hurt for me to just look around a little bit.
Sure.
Now, I suggested Navajo white, but he went with sandstone.
What do you think?
This is where he keeps his clothes, isn't it?
Do you think anybody heard that?
Like who?
I don't know.
I'm just nervous.
God, there's no way I could explain it if I got caught.
How are you going to get caught?
Because people always get caught in this situation.
What if Evan comes back unexpectedly.
Look, he's in Europe, okay?
You don't come back unexpectedly from Europe.
You come back unexpectedly from the movies or shopping.
But you don't come back unexpect  What?
What?
Oh, my God, it's Mr. Drake!
He's back unexpectedly from Europe!
Oh, I have to get out of here.
Norm, are you here?
Uh, yes, sir.
Be right down, sir.
No, that's all right, I'm coming up.
For the love of Go, go, go, go, go.
Norm  Oh, oh, right, right.
Okay.
Ah, Norm there you are.
Hi, sir.
What are you doing here, sir?
Oh, I wound up everything in a marathon session.
I haven't slept for three days.
Three days.
Let me take you out for a cup of coffee, sir.
No, no, no.
All I want to do is sleep for about a week.
Should I get your pajamas, sir?
No!
No?
No.
Oh, I thought you meant my pajamas.
No, they're, uh, they're too far away from here and I don't even think they'd fit Mr. Drake.
Actually, I think you'll find a clean pair of pajamas in the bag.
I thought you were going to fix that.
Oh, yeah, that squeak.
I'm going to fix that squeak, sir.
You should go to another room.
I may need to use the jaws of life.
Uh, no, just leave it, will ya?
As a matter of fact, forget the painting thing, too.
I'm a light sleeper, and I don't want to hear you rattling your paint cans.
Well, that's one thing I've never been accused of, sir, is rattling my cans.
Please, I mean it, Norm.
Scoot.
Huh?
Yes, sir.
: So you're a really light sleeper, sir?
Yes, but I have excellent hearing, Norm.
Yeah, most light sleepers do.
That's what makes them light sleepers.
So you just left her in the closet?
Believe me, I did everything I could to get the guy out of the room for like one minute, but he wouldn't budge.
So you just left her in the closet?
There was nothing else I could do, okay?
So you just left her in the closet?
Carla, it wasn't my fault, all right?
It's been at least an hour.
She should have snuck out by now.
Oh, come on.
She'd be here if she'd gotten away.
You gotta get her out of there.
Hey, look.
You, uh, you think of it as an adventure.
She's the damsel in distress and you are the knight in shiny white armor, leaping upon your steed.
And driving it into the ground up to its knees.
No, no, no, no, and saving a damsel.
I guess you're right, you're right.
I gotta go do this.
Listen, uh, Cliffie, if I'm not back in an hour, go ahead and finish my beer.
This is your beer.
Sammy, I hear you got a sure thing lined up, huh?
Mm, no, I never like to use the term "sure thing".
I prefer the term "in the bag".
What?
What?
Ah, Sammy, come on.
Isn't this, you know, pretending to be a phony-bologna dancer a little bit beneath you?
I mean, when I go picking up girls, I don't need all that stuff.
All I need is a wink and a smile.
And a rag doused with chloroform.
I don't know, Sammy.
It looks to me like you're getting a little desperate.
What are you talk I'm not desperate.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Ready, Sam?
Oh, hi, Jennifer.
I'll be right with you.
See you guys later.
Ready to go?
Mm-hmm.
Mr. Drake!
Mr. Drake, sir!
Sorry, sir, but Mr. Peterson said it was an emergency.
What?
Emergency?
Yeah, structural, Evan.
It's just a damn good thing I went back and checked those blueprints.
This ceiling could go at any second.
Ceiling?
Yeah, it's a crack, sir.
It extends all the way into, uh, here.
: Get me out of here.
What crack?
There's nothing wrong with that ceiling.
I'm only thinking of your safety, sir.
Now, I'd feel much better if you slept in a different room.
Peterson, get out.
And close that closet door.
Well, wait a minute.
Many people prefer to sleep with the closet door open.
Is there something wrong with you?
Yeah, it's, um, it's the paint fumes, sir.
They make me giddy.
Really.
And, uh, I'm afraid they can be hazardous to your health, sir.
Oh, nonsense.
No one was ever killed by paint fumes.
But, uh, they can cause brain damage.
Evidently.
Now get out of here.
Sir, I have some paint cans in the closet there.
I'd feel much better for you if I tightened those lids.
Whatever, just do it, get out of here.
Norm, I'm so glad to see you.
You gotta get me out of here.
Okay.
Every time I open the door, it squeaks and he starts to wake up.
If he finds me here in the morning, he will fire me, hate me, and he is never, ever going to want to be my boyfriend.
Aw  Norm, are you talking to your paints?
Uh, yes, I am, sir.
Come on, come on.
Just, just calm down, all right?
Calm down.
Calm down.
Okay?
Everything's going to be fine.
I'm going to get you out of Whoo, cashmere.
Here's my plan, okay?
I'm going to walk out of here.
I'm going to leave the closet door yea bit open, right?
So it won't squeak.
Now you wait until he's good and sound asleep, and then you just walk on out of here, okay?
Okay.
If you're hungry, I brought you some chips.
Cajun style?
Never mind.
Just go ahead.
Okay, all right.
Good luck.
Is he asleep?
Get lost.
Getting lost, sir.
Oh, like an open door would really kill you, Greyson, huh?
So you just left her in the closet?
I had a foolproof plan to get her out of there and the whole thing got spoiled by this anal-retentive butler.
Mr. Peterson, you gotta get her out of there.
Oh How did I get myself into this?
I should have never become a house painter.
I should have listened to my mother and become a matador.
You know, Norm, you are probably too logical.
What?
Yes, you see, it's an established psychological fact that the more outrageous a lie one tells, the more readily will the victim believe it.
You see, if you told Mr. Drake a sufficiently outlandish story, odds are he'd buy it.
No, that's impossible.
No, Woody, it's a stroke of genius.
Frasier, you're brilliant.
That is one of the most brilliant ideas you've ever had.
And you've had a lot of brilliant ideas.
Thank you, Carla.
See, Woody?
It works.
Bonehead bought it.
All right.
All right.
All right, I guess I just gotta go do this.
I've got to do it.
If it doesn't work out, tomorrow I'm going to be shopping for toreador pants.
Hey, where you going?
I gotta get Rebecca out of the damn closet.
You just left her in the closet?
Where's Frasier, man?
I gotta talk to him.
Where's your date?
She's at my apartment.
I told her I was going out for some ice.
I don't know, something's wrong here.
I've been dancing my brains out and nothing, zilch.
Frasier, you know that, that beautiful girl you were treating this morning?
I treated two beautiful women this morning, Sam.
Which one?
The one that had the hots for the dancers.
Yes, why?
Well, uh, you didn't cure her, by any chance, did you?
You don't just "cure" someone overnight.
Most patients require dozens of costly sessions to make even minimal progress.
God, I love this profession.
Well, I don't know.
Something's wrong.
Maybe it's my dancing.
You treated two beautiful girls this morning?
What did you treat the other one for?
Um, pyromania.
Pyro pyromania.
Pyro     What?
Stop!
You can't go in there!
Up, sir!
Up quick!
Bees!
Killer bees are coming this way from Mexico and they're hopping mad, sir!
Bees?
Yeah, those suckers could swarm through here like a buzz saw.
Sir, you don't have any honey in here, do you?
Peterson, get out of here.
And if you come back in here again, I'm going to have Greyson use his gun.
Understood?
Yes, sir!
Hey, he was talking to me, okay, Greyson?
Look, sir, let me just get your robe.
I'm very concerned about these bees.
Well, never mind.
They've gone.
Yeah.
There they go.
They're headed up to Canada or someplace.
What is it?
Bee sting.
They're back, sir.
Peterson, what the hell is going on?
Sir, I'm sorry.
I I didn't want to have to tell you this, but you're forcing me to.
Oh, please, tell me quickly.
If I don't sleep, I'll die.
And I'm gonna take you with me.
It's, actually, it's kind of personal.
Do you mind, Greyson?
Sir?
Whatever.
Anything that will get him out of here.
Sir, to begin with, when I was a little boy, I was very poor.
Peterson, I'm not going to survive any story that begins with when you were little.
Oh, right.
Sir, I've had this fantasy that's haunted me all my life.
At night, when I'm lying in bed, it comes and torments me.
Oh, I know the feeling.
Yes, sir.
Of course you do.
Anyway, this is my fantasy, sir.
It's a little outrageous.
So, uh, just stay with me.
Even though I was born poor and I'll never be a rich man, somehow, it wouldn't make any difference if one time, sir, just one time, just one darn time, I could do something symbolic, like carry a rich man across the lawn in his pajamas.
Come here.
I know, I know, I know, it sounds crazy, I know.
Sir, no.
sir, I don't have a fever.
No, I know that.
I'm feeling for the lobotomy scar.
Sir, sir, please.
Sir, please, please.
All right, all right, all right, all right!
Look, if I actually let you do it, Uh-huh.
would you promise me, would you swear on your mother's grave that you would let me sleep?
Yes, sir, I swear.
I prom No, no, no, no, no.
you've got to do more than promise.
You've got to give me your solemn oath as a crazy person.
My oath, my vow, my pledge.
I promise you.
All right, okay.
Thank you so much, sir.
All right.
Thank you, thank you very much, sir.
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you so much, sir.
You know, sir, I don't mean to flatter you, but you're very firm for your age.
Thank you very much, sir.
It was everything I dreamed it would be.
Whoa, hey, whoa, who made the bed?
I did, sir.
When?
The instant Mr. Drake vacated the premises.
You mean you came in here the instant we left and you haven't left since?
Aw, sir.
Sir.
Sir?
I don't know quite how to tell you this, sir.
We've got to own up, sir.
I've got to tell you the truth.
Now ow!
What?
What?
Ah!
Ah!
Ahh!
You should do that before you go to sleep.
It clears the lungs.
Ahh!
You'll sleep much better.
Sweet dreams.
Hi, sir.
Oh, I knew it, I knew it.
You broke your word.
No, no, no.
You lied to me, Norm.
No, no, no, sir.
You see, I went back to the bar to tell everyone about my dream coming true.
And since none of their dreams have come true, they wouldn't believe mine.
Why are you doing this to me?
Why?
Sir, my dream is to have people know that I carried a rich man across the lawn in his pajamas.
You're going to hurt me.
No, sir.
I just need witnesses.
I've got several lined up outside.
Greyson would fill out the troop nicely, sir.
Just a couple minutes, This is a nightmare.
then it'd be all over, sir.
You can sleep, I promise.
This isn't happening to me.
This is a nightmare.
Don't worry about it, sir.
We're going out now, but only for a minute!
Will there be any more bees?
Oh, no, no, no, sir.
You shut your eyes now.
All gone, all gone.
Hey, guys, here they come.
Here they come.
They're coming, they're coming.
He's got Drake.
Oh, here they come.
Yes, Norm.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
Whoa, Cliffie, new Weekly Gabber I see, huh?
Yeah, you betcha.
Look at this headline here.
"Suicidal Twin Kills Brother by Mistake".
Oh, Cliff, you don't actually believe that pack of lies, do you?
Well, Dr. Crane, it just shows you how much you know about free press here in America.
I mean, uh, they can't print it unless it's the truth.
Well, granted, you know, some of these stories might be a bit exaggerated, but, uh, I guarantee you at the core of each is the kernel of truth.
Allow me to demonstrate.
Hey, hey.
Come here, fella.
Listen, I just won five bucks in the lottery.
Pass it on, will ya?
Thanks a lot.
The truth has begun its journey now around the bar.
When it returns, it may be a little bit distorted, you know.
People will be saying I won $500, maybe $5,000, maybe five million dollars, but I guarantee you the essence of the message will be the truth.
Hey, Norm, get this.
Some geek brain's all jazzed because he just won five bucks.
Touché.
Making your way in the world today Takes everything you've got Taking a break from all your worries Sure would help a lot Wouldn't you like to get away?
Sometimes you want to go Where everybody knows your name And they're always glad you came You want to be where you can see Our troubles are all the same You want to be where everybody knows your name You want to go where people know People are all the same You want to go where everybody knows your name.
Listen up, everyone.
One of the most influential reviewers in the city has been going around to different bars in the area reviewing them.
Need I say more?
Yes.
Woody, in case he comes in here, I want everybody on his best behavior.
Aw, gee, does this mean we're going to have to cancel the midget tossing contest?
Sam, please don't joke about this.
This really means a lot to me.
Oh, don't worry about it.
I'm sure we'll do great.
As long as the reviewer doesn't happen to be that SOB Murray Treadwell.
You remember him?
Well, I'm not saying it is, but what if it were?
Well, then you better kiss your butt good-bye.
Actually, that sounds more like a job for me, doesn't it?
What's the matter with him?
He's a hater.
The guy hates everybody.
I hate people like that.
Yeah.
He gave Cheers a really bad review a couple years ago.
Really bad.
I almost stopped coming here.
What did he say?
A bar full of bores.
Yeah, oafish clientele.
Dumb lug of a bartender.
Well, we're under new management here.
A lot of things have changed.
Like what?
We have ferns.
Didn't he say anything nice?
Yes, as a matter of fact, he said the one saving grace was the refreshing lack of ferns.
You guys are just trying to rattle me.
With the changes I've instituted and with Carla locked in the storage closet, everything's going to be fine.
Hi, guys.
Oh, Carla, Eddie called and said he got a job as a penguin.
Great!
Hey, did you hear that, everybody?
My husband just hooked on with the Pittsburgh Penguins.
Hey, that's great.
Pittsburgh-- they're an up-and-coming club, huh?
I'd say Eddie LeBec is on his way to becoming a legend.
Gee, Cliff, what a great thing to say, thanks.
I meant every word of it, Carla.
: Can Eddie get us tickets?
You know, what I like best about that team What?
is their uniforms.
I mean, the Penguin uniforms are far and away the coolest in the league.
Hey, everybody!
Eddie?
Who else could it be?
Wow, Carla, are their home uniforms that neat-looking too?
Hey, Carla, listen.
It's been breaking me up, you know, not being able to find work, not being able to support you and the kids.
It's like I was losing myself as a man.
Well, now, you know, I got a job.
Aren't you proud of me?
Eddie, take off your beak.
This is a joke, right?
You're with Pittsburgh.
Pittsburgh?
No, I'm with the Wonderful World of Ice.
You know, that big ice show.
They're hiring lots of hockey players like me.
Hey, at least you won't have to worry about renting a tux, Eddie.
Yeah, what are they paying you, Ed?
Seven, eight fish a day?
Hey, you guys, knock it off.
He's got himself an honest job.
He gets paid.
He, um come on, help me out here, man.
All right, all right.
Can it, you clowns.
You know, a lot of people criticize hockey players.
They say they're wasting their time.
After their careers are over they're not prepared for anything.
Well, my Eddie just proved them wrong.
Thank you, Carla.
You walked around in public in that thing?
I thought you'd get a kick out of it.
Listen, uh, Carla, I got to fly to Seattle tomorrow.
You can't fly in that thing, can you?
No, Woody, I'm going on an airplane.
I know, I mean you're not going to fly in that thing, are you?
Seattle?
I just I can't believe you're going to be that far away.
It won't be that long.
Look, I'll call you every day.
Hey, maybe you want to come out and see me, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah, well you know, it's really a long way, Eddie.
We'll talk about it tonight, okay?
What do you want for dinner?
I don't know.
I kind of got the urge for mackerel.
Gee, I'm sure going to miss you, Carla.
Well, who wouldn't?
You know, not to be overly sentimental, but you're the best husband I ever had.
I'll see you, Carla.
Yeah, see ya Penguin.
I wonder where couples get those cute little names they call each other.
Well, soon.
Eddie, look, I just can't fly out of here.
Are you forgetting I got seven kids?
Oh, right, eight.
Look, look, I'd love to talk to you some more, but Sam's calling me.
What?
Ow!
Be right there, Sam.
Okay, I'll talk to you tomorrow then, bye.
Hey, uh, Carla, I couldn't help but notice that Eddie calls you every single day asking you to go out there, and you just keep giving him the brush-off.
I mean, hey, what gives here, little lady?
Drop it.
Or I'll set your face on fire and beat out the flames with your butt.
Well, does that satisfy your curiosity, Cliff?
Totally.
But it does raise a series of other questions.
Hey, hey, hey.
That restaurant critic guy's here.
Where?
Right over there, see?
Oh, my God.
How do I look, Sam?
You've got a little drool on the corner of your mouth there.
No, no, no, leave it.
I think I better go see what he wants.
No, relax.
Carla's got it.
Oh, my God!
Carla, you don't mind, do you?
Not at all.
When you're through, there's a table of six in the corner.
Hello.
You're Murray Treadwell, aren't you?
Yes, and you must be one of the Flying Wallendas.
No, I'm Rebecca Howe.
I'm the new manager here.
I hope you enjoy your visit here.
Oh, I'm sure I will.
Would you like a drink?
That seems vaguely appropriate.
I'll get it.
You probably want something specific.
How about a vodka martini?
Excellent choice.
Anything special?
Stirred, shaken, two olives?
A little sword?
I'd like it today.
Coming right up.
Vodka martini for Mr. Treadwell and make it snappy.
Oh, no, that's the one drink I don't know how to make.
Things seem to be going very well.
Yeah, just make sure he gets a napkin.
We only lost about a thousand points on that last time.
As if it would have really killed him to use the paper towels.
Thank you, Sam.
Here you go, Mr. Treadwell.
Notice the cocktail napkin.
There's plenty more where that one came from.
Mm, very nice.
Yes, we make a good martini here.
Oh, that, too.
Very sweet of you.
Do you have any questions about Cheers?
Actually, I do.
But, unfortunately, I'm running a little bit late.
Would you, by any chance be free for dinner tonight?
Dinner?
Yes, it's the third meal of the day.
We could find somewhere nice and quiet where we wouldn't be disturbed.
Uh I don't know.
You know, the more time you and I spend together, the happier I think you'll be with the review.
Will you excuse me a minute?
I just want to check my schedule.
He wants me to have dinner with him.
That means he expects something for a good review.
I'll get the petty cash.
Sam.
He wants me to compromise myself.
Honey, we all do.
Why do I even talk to you?
I'm not going to make a big deal of this.
It's just going to be another business dinner.
That's all.
Everything will be fine.
Listen to me.
Listen.
If, uh, one thing should lead to another tonight and you wake up in the morning and find out you done something you wish you hadn't, I just want you to know, I'd love to take you out tomorrow night.
So I stand by my original review, "the Hungry Heifer is a trough".
Okay, fine.
But listen, if you can find a better 25-ounce steak for $1.99, pal, you just let me know, all right?
I'd be happy to have dinner with you tonight.
Great, I'll pick you up at 7:00.
Terrific.
I'll see you then, Mr. Treadwell.
Please, call me Murray.
All right, all right, sure thing, Eddie.
Okay, listen, break a wing.
I know, I know, I know, you hate those jokes.
Listen, just keep a stiff upper beak.
I'm sorry.
All right, bye-bye, bye-bye.
Oh, heck.
That was your husband on the phone there, Carla.
Why was he calling you?
Well, he's upset.
He wanted me to ask you, find out why, you know, you won't go see him.
How can I, Sam?
I can't afford a plane ticket to Seattle.
Well, now I could loan you the money.
Great.
But who could get the time off?
If it's for the sake of your marriage, I'm sure we could work something out.
If you'd like to take a leave of absence for say, a year, that would be fine.
I-I really, I don't know why everybody thinks I could just pick myself up and go.
I got two newborn babies.
Take them.
Tykes fly free.
Yeah, usually in the seat right next to me.
Look, I can't go, so let's just drop it, okay?
Geez.
Just came up for a drink order.
Carla, Eddie's afraid that you're ashamed of him.
Well, I'm not.
Well, tell him.
Don't tell me.
I will!
The minute he gets back.
You're not afraid to fly, are you, Carla?
Me?
Afraid to fly?
Me?
Well, it must be something.
I am not afraid to fly.
I'm not!
I'm afraid to crash.
Did you have a bad experience?
Yes, I did!
First time in an airplane.
It was on my honeymoon with Nick.
We're going to New York-- short flight, no problem, right?
Well, suddenly, the plane hits turbulence, right?
Me and Nick were thrown all around that bathroom.
I haven't flown since.
Sweetheart, that was just one time.
I mean, look at me.
When I was playing ball, I must have flown and I don't remember anything happening.
'Cause you were always drunk.
Damn right.
Good afternoon.
Hey.
Oh, hey, Frasier.
Yeah.
You're just the man I'm looking for here.
You looking for my camaraderie, Sam, or do you want some free psychiatric advice?
Uh that free thing there.
Good.
Come on.
What do you say, Carla?
Oh, no way, Sam.
Uh-uh.
I like my head this size.
Just keep him away from me.
He's the only shrink we know.
Oh, stop, Sam.
You're embarrassing me.
What's the problem?
Well, Carla wants to visit Eddie on the West Coast, but she's afraid to fly.
Well, do you mean, by afraid to fly, what?
Um she's claustrophobic, agoraphobic, or acrophobic?
Death-o-phobic.
Well, you know, Carla, I've done a lot of reading lately about fear of flying.
I've always wanted to conduct a workshop for people with your problem.
I'm sure I could scare up a few people like you.
Oh, no pun intended.
None noticed, I am sure.
No way, Frasier.
I am not going to wind up in your office, strapped to some table with electricity shot through my head.
Carla, that's not part of the therapy.
Oh, yeah?
What about Diane?
Now, look.
I never treated Diane with any kind of shock inducement.
Of course, now I wish I had.
No, no.
The key to this therapy, you see, is, uh desensitization.
Over a period of sessions, we slowly break down your fears until you're ready to get on a plane.
And, at the end, we all take an actual flight.
Yeah?
Well, fly this, Orville.
Cheers.
Hey, Sam.
Oh, hey, Eddie.
Long time no hear.
Yeah.
How you doing?
Oh, the show?
It's okay.
It's kind of a hockey players' reunion.
Listen.
Did you talk to her, Sam?
I mean, what did she say?
No, listen.
The problem, Eddie, is not that she's afraid to see you.
It's that she's afraid to fly.
Carla, afraid?
Carla's not afraid of anything, Sam.
See, that's just an excuse.
I mean, she's ashamed of me.
You know something?
It's just not working.
I'm going to quit.
No, wait.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Listen, he's so sure you're ashamed of him that he wants to quit.
Really?
Yes.
Give me this phone.
Eddie?
I'm coming to see you.
I'll be there in about a week.
Really?
Aw, gee, Carla.
I got the biggest smile you ever saw on my face.
I wish you could see me.
Eddie?
Before we take off, I'd like to commend you.
It's been an intense week, but here we are, finally, at the end of our journey.
Or should I say, perhaps the beginning of the end of our journey.
I guess we're all set.
Let's get this show on the road.
Dr. Crane, uh I I hope you don't mind.
I brought along a little Saint Christopher's medal.
Oh.
Well, no.
If that helps you, that's fine.
Oh, great.
Anybody else want one?
Now, now, Carla.
All religious artifacts must be stored either below the seat in front of you or in the overhead bin.
There, now.
Isn't this fun?
Huh?
Now we're going to take off in a few minutes, so what should we all be doing?
People?
Well, we should be focusing on our happy place.
That place where we most like to be where we're most relaxed.
Can you see it?
Excuse me, sir.
We'll be taking off shortly.
Would you please sit down?
Oh, yes, of course.
Just a moment.
All right, now, you're in your happy place.
Hmm?
You're at peace with the world.
Oh, God.
Now, just stay in your happy place.
If it's the beach, just imagine that that sound is the gentle rippling of the water.
Carla, where's your happy place?
On the floor of my stomach, clutching the earth with both hands.
Good.
Good!
Oh!
Uh Dr. Crane I've forgotten where my happy place is.
I think yours was in the Berkshires.
Oh, yes.
Mine is in the Berkshires.
Look, everybody can be in the Berkshires if they like.
The Berkshires is an expansive and wonderful wooded wonderland.
That's going to go up like a Roman candle when this baby crashes into it!
Ladies and gentlemen, we've been cleared for takeoff.
So please, sit back, relax.
Thanks for flying with us.
Did he say, "Thanks for dying with us"?
Just relax.
I'll be sitting right here beside you.
If you're a little nervous, go ahead and grab on to me.
Afternoon, everybody.
Norm!
Norm!
Norm!
What's the story, Mr. Peterson?
"Bobbsey Twins Go to the Brewery".
Let's just cut to the happy ending.
Uh-oh!
We got the Cheers review today.
Oh, God!
Here it comes.
Well, at least you'll all know I didn't compromise myself.
And that we probably got a horrendous review and I'll get fired.
I can still look at myself in the mirror and say, "Would it have killed you"?
"Hurrah, hurrah for Cheers, the best bar in Boston".
Oh, you slept with him.
I did not.
"Warm, inviting, a delight from top to bottom".
The bar or you?
I did not sleep with him.
Oh, stop it.
I think I respect you more now than I ever did.
I did not sleep with him.
You just have a filthy mind.
Nobody else in here thinks that, so just shut up.
How was he?
I did not sleep with him.
Yeah.
Cheers.
As a matter of fact, she is.
Hold on one second.
It's your boss.
Hello.
Mr. Drake.
Did you happen to catch our remarkable review?
Good?
Oh, it was fantastic.
Yes.
We're all very proud.
Yeah, well, you know, we work pretty hard No!
I did not sleep with him.
Good air in and the bad air out.
That's good.
Nice, easy breathing.
Now, there.
Don't you all feel better?
Now, now.
Remember what we learned.
Meow, meow, meow.
Meow, meow, meow.
Meow, meow, meow.
That's just a little kitty cat.
C-A- Clear Air Turbulence.
Now now that you're all relaxed, we can take this opportunity to, uh well, further discuss the irrationality of our fears.
Anyone?
II I just wish I had more control.
I think I'd feel better if I were flying the plane.
Trust me.
That doesn't help.
How do you know?
I was a pilot for this airline.
You were?
I was flying a jumbo jet-- full plane-- and it occurred to me that all these people had their lives in the hands of someone like me.
I couldn't go up again.
Forget the pilot!
What about those mechanics, huh?
I mean, what if one of those guys has a bad day?
Forgets to screw in a lug nut?
Carla, they're trained technicians.
Aren't they in a labor dispute?
Yes, but it's almost over.
Well, what happens if we get hit by lightning?
Oh, now, I'm sure the plane is designed to handle that.
Or if a teeny, tiny little bird gets in the engine?
God!
What bird would be flying at 30,000 feet?
We're at 30,000 feet?
This plane is too heavy to be up that high!
If anything happens, we're all just going to drop like spit off the Prudential Building.
Carla, now you're being silly.
Listen, statistics prove that this is The hell with statistics.
Does the words "ice on the wings" mean anything to you?
Oh, that is simply the sun glinting off the wings.
Does that look like ice to you?
Meow, meow, meow.
Meow, meow, meow.
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.
Will you stop that incessant caterwauling?
Meow, meow, meow.
Why aren't they serving drinks?
Hey, Fras, you okay?
I'm fine.
Fine.
You look a little green.
I'm perfectly all right.
Where is that damn cocktail cart?
What was that?
What?
That pinging noise.
I heard it.
I heard a ping, a ping, ping.
What, have you all gone deaf or something?
Hey, hey, ease up.
Do you feel cold air rushing in here?
No.
My God!
There's a leak in the fuselage!
Calm down, Frasier.
Oh, God, look!
It's the wings!
They're flapping around like a wounded duck!
We're all gonna die!
Frasier!
You're not in your happy place.
What do you mean?
In a grave?
We're going down!
We're going down!
I got to get out of here!
Mommy!
Mommy!
Frasier!
Honest, Eddie.
I'm flying out tomorrow night.
Yeah.
Frasier's class taught me how stupid it was to be afraid of flying.
Oh, me, too.
I can't wait to get you alone, strip you out of that penguin outfit, and climb all over ya.
We're sharing a room with the three little pigs?
Well, they're used to huffing and puffing.
All right.
See you then.
Sam, you don't really think Miss Howe would do anything she shouldn't have to get a good review, do you?
No, Of course not.
Then why do you keep teasing her?
Well, haven't you ever noticed how her chest kind of heaves when she's angry?
I always avert my eyes.
You're kidding me.
No.
I'm a leg man.
Excuse me, miss?
I couldn't help but overhear your conversation.
I've had a fear of flying for years, and I think it's time that I confronted it.
How can I get into that class that worked miracles for you?
I can do better than that.
The doctor's over there.
Hey, Fras?
I'm in my happy place.
Sign up early.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
Payday, payday.
Sam, Carla, Woody.
Oh, come to Papa, baby.
Boy, have I got plans for you.
Yeah, no kidding, Woody?
What are you going to do with it?
Put it in the bank.
Whoo, don't get arrested, buddy.
Hey, Shoulder Pads, freeze.
Yes, Carla?
I seem to be a little short.
Yes, but you have a warm personality.
When you added up my paycheck, I think you forgot to count a couple of fingers and toes.
Oh, I'm afraid I had to dock you a total of two and three quarters hours for being late last week.
I had good excuses.
Three deaths in the family since Monday?
It's been a bad week.
Carla, Carla, here's a little time management trick that I use.
I set my watch ahead a half an hour.
That way, when I think I'm getting someplace on time, I'm actually fooling myself into getting there early.
Hey, you know, that makes good business sense, boss.
I guess if I set my watch an hour ahead, it'd be twice as good, huh?
Right.
Hey, what do you know?
It's lunch time.
No wonder I'm so hungry.
Making your way in the world today Takes everything you've got Taking a break from all your worries Sure would help a lot Wouldn't you like to get away?
Sometimes you want to go Where everybody knows your name And they're always glad you came You want to be where you can see Our troubles are all the same You want to be where everybody knows your name You want to go where people know People are all the same You want to go where everybody knows your name.
What you reading, Cliffie?
Oh, the, uh, Massachusetts Scientific Journal.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah, you know, this, uh, magazine is sent to some of the most prestigious and high-minded intellectuals in the greater metropolitan area.
How come you have it?
Some guy on my route left town and uh, didn't leave a forwarding address.
Oh, hey, Carla, looky here.
It says the Britain Institute's doing research on twins.
Maybe you can get your gruesome twosome in there, eh?
Yeah, right, like I got nothing better to do than schlep Little Elvis and Jesse around.
Especially so some pointy-heads can plug electrodes into their skulls to see what makes them slobber.
That's too bad; they're offering, uh, 50 bucks apiece.
I always wondered what makes them slobber.
Sorry I'm late.
Where's Sam?
He's upstairs having lunch with Evan Dreck.
Oh, God, Mr. Drake shows up on a day that I'm late?
Well, don't worry.
I've covered for you.
Told him you were drunk.
What does this mean?
When did Evan start taking Sam to lunch?
When did the two of them become good friends?
When did I start talking to myself?
Hey, maybe he's going to put Sam in charge of the bar again.
What?
Don't make me laugh.
Sam, I'm serious about that offer.
Now, I want to move you up.
What do you say?
Oh, sounds tempting.
When I see you behind that bar, the more convinced I am your talents are being wasted.
Yeah, I know, I know, but they won't let me bring a bed in here.
Yes, yes, boy, thank you; of course I will.
I, uh, I'll get the ball rolling.
Hello, Mr. Drake.
It's so wonderful to see you again.
Yeah, I'm going to use your phone.
You scum-sucking, power-hungry, backbiting creep.
You stole my job.
Ah, come on.
That's not true.
But I will bite your back for you if you want.
Oh, well, then, what were you talking to Evan about?
He just offered me an executive position down at headquarters.
You scum-sucking, power-hungry, backbiting creep!
Hi, Mr. Drake.
I was just congratulating Sam.
Great.
Uh, it's all set, Sam.
Hey, uh, listen.
Uh, I'm really excited about this, but are you sure that I'm qualified?
I mean, you know, I never even finished college.
How far did you get?
Halfway through the application.
I still have it here if you Nah, that's okay.
You're qualified.
See you tomorrow.
All right.
Whoo.
Something funny is going on here.
Why did he hire Sam?
Why is he making him an executive?
What's the matter with me?
Well, for one thing, Miss Howe, you talk to yourself an awful lot.
Hmm.
Mr. Malone, I hate to rush you, but people are waiting.
Have you made a decision yet?
Yes, Mimi, I have.
I'll take the tuna on toast with iced tea.
Done.
Oh, and, uh, after lunch, we'll, uh, finish the memo I was drafting.
Where did we leave off?
"To whom it may concern".
Boy, I like the way that sounds.
Mr. Malone, some gentlemen are here to see you from the firm of Peterson, Clavin and Boyd.
Peterson, Clavin and Boyd, Peterson, Clavin and Boyd.
Uh, Mimi, tell them I'm in an important meeting and can't see them, please.
Hey, get in here, you mugs!
Uh, Sam, don't be nice, now.
If you really have a meeting, we don't want to bother you.
No, no, oh, come on.
Get in here.
Get in here.
Well, major corporate digs, buddy, eh?
Talk about your office in the sky.
Hey, oh, hey, lookit down here.
There's a guy washing windows.
Ooh.
That's one job you wouldn't catch me doing for all the bridges in Bridgeport.
Standing on a platform there, suspended hundreds of feet over certain death.
You said it.
Hey, let's throw something at him and scare him, eh?
Hey, you know, actually, uh, these, uh, windows don't open.
You're in a what's called a climate- controlled office.
Very impressed, Sam, eh?
Oh, hey, Sammy, you do look every inch the corporate muckety-muck there, doesn't he?
Well, you know, I don't want to brag.
Mimi, get in here and brag for me, will you?
Just kidding, Mimi.
While I have you, Mr. Drake is on his way over.
Oh, guys, I'm sorry, men, uh  Oh, yeah, sure.
That's okay.
That's all right.
Uh, we're running late for our next appointment anyway, boys.
Where is that?
It's at the bottom of the lobby escalator watching the secretaries go up to the lunchroom.
All aboard for the Underalls Express, now leaving Track 29.
: You mugs!
Ah, Sam.
Oh, hey, Evan.
I'm sorry.
I was engrossed in my work here.
Just came to check on you.
How you doing?
Looks like you're making yourself at home here.
Desk.
Supplies, huh?
And the requisite picture of your, uh self.
It's not really a great one, but it's the only big one I had.
Yeah, well You're all set then, huh?
Yeah, oh, yeah.
Full steam ahead.
Take no prisoners.
Excellent.
All right.
You know, I, uh I do have, uh, one little question, though.
Shoot.
W-What do I do?
Ah, yes, well, now, yours being a newly created position, your responsibilities as yet are not clearly defined.
Well, uh, that helps, that helps.
But we're looking for your input.
Input-- got you; all right, input.
Yeah, well, listen, I'm going to be late for lunch, so, uh, we'll talk later at softball practice, huh?
Oh, hey, you got a softball team, huh?
Oh, yeah, all the corporations do.
It's a lot of fun, very casual.
Wear cleats.
Hey, I'll have lots of input for you then, sir.
Okay, all right.
Input, input.
Let's see, here.
Mimi, call Maintenance.
Ridiculous.
Stupid Sam.
Executive?
I'm sorry.
Are you talking to me?
No, I was talking to my Yes, I was.
So, you say that they did make Sam an executive?
Oh, yeah, absolutely.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Giving him the red carpet treatment over there.
He's a regular Armand Hammer.
Oh, that reminds me.
I got to change the baking soda in my refrigerator.
Hi, everybody.
I just got back from twin testing, and I would like to announce that I now like science than I used to.
Hey, all right.
I found out that Little Elvis is a lot more aggressive in certain situations than Jesse.
Or is it vice versa?
Ah, who cares?
Not these twins.
Whoa.
People, I have an announcement!
Mr. Sam Malone, the newest member of the corporate softball team, just pitched a shutout against General Electric!
I'd say I loved pinning back the ears of a Fortune 500 company.
Kind of makes you feel proud to be part of the corporation, doesn't it?
Rah-rah-rah.
Hey, you know, I never knew that you were a cheerleader.
Although I have always admired your pom-poms.
Sam, uh, why does your jersey say "Heppel" on the back?
Oh, that was some guy who used to work for the company.
They haven't had time to order mine yet.
Supply problems.
"Supply problems".
Yeah.
Yes, that happens a lot in large corporations.
You know, Sam, they were really lucky to get you on the team.
You want to know how lucky?
They just made the playoffs the day before they hired me.
Oh, my!
I finally figured it out.
Life makes sense, and I am not crazy.
Well, that's only a layman's opinion.
Sam is a ringer.
Evan just hired him to win the championship.
In two weeks, he'll be out of there.
Now, Rebecca, you can't tell him that.
At least let the man enjoy his day in the sun.
All right.
Sam has taken enough hard knocks this year.
No, it's pleasure enough for me to just know.
I won't break his heart.
Oh, hey, uh, Rebecca, the guys decided that you could be our cheerleader on one condition.
Lose the bra.
I won't break his heart.
I will rip it from his chest.
Here are those copies of your report, Mr. Malone.
Oh, great.
You got colored paper.
Oh.
Hey, hey.
Look at that.
Lots of input.
Am I interrupting anything?
Oh, hey, Rebecca.
No, come on in.
Thank you, Mimi.
Well, Rebecca welcome to the, uh, executive office.
Would you like to have a seat in the executive chair there?
Or maybe on the executive sofa?
Or how 'bout the executive lap?
No, but, uh, seriously, uh, what-what brings you down to corporate?
Oh, I have a little information about your promotion that I'm going to really enjoy sharing with you.
Oh, yeah.
Listen.
Before you do, there's something I want to talk to you about, too.
Uh, sit down, please, sit down.
Uh I just want to say tha-that I'm sorry, you know, for teasing you the way I did and everything.
I know we both had a lot of fun with it, but i-it wasn't right.
That's okay.
I just wanted No, no, no.
See, it, it wasn't okay.
I mean, absolutely not.
I I think I was just trying to, you know, show off in front of the guys.
Truth is this is all kind of new to me.
I keep expecting somebody to come through the door and say, "Malone, job's over.
You're through.
"Get out of here," and it's a big joke.
Good.
Is it my turn now?
No, in a second, in a second.
You know, the, uh first thing that I did-- when I was alone in the office here-- I, uh, called my father, who I hadn't talked to for over three years.
And when I told him where I was sitting, you know, what I was looking out at, and, uh, what, what my title is  for the first time ever, he told me how proud he was of me.
: Anyway.
Whoa!
Uh, what-what are you dying to tell me here?
Just that we are darn proud of you, too.
Oh, thank you!
God, that's great.
Thank you.
Hey, hey, get a load of this.
My folks, uh-- their wedding anniversary is next month.
I'm gonna fly them in here, and I'm gonna give them the grand tour.
I just can't wait to see their faces.
Stop.
What?
Sam I didn't want to have to tell you this, but now I have to.
All right, all right, What do you got?
No, I actually did want to have to tell you this, but I wanted to enjoy it, and now you've ruined that, and I have to tell you anyway.
You're not gonna be here next month.
What do you mean?
Malone, you're a ringer.
Ooh, I did like doing it a little bit.
Wh-What do you mean, ringer?
I mean that Evan just hired you to win the championship.
And when that's over, you're history.
Oh, boy.
I should have expected this.
Sam, it's just the way of the business world.
No, no, no, no.
I mean, that you are jealous.
How petty of you.
I can't believe this.
You know, the fact that I played baseball has nothing to do with this job.
I am a good executive.
And, you know, you are way off base, and I'm gonna prove it to you.
Mimi, get-get Mr. Drake on the phone right away.
Right away, Mr. Malone.
Sam, you don't have to do this.
You know, I was hired for a lot of reasons.
Like what?
Yeah, I'll tell you, "like what," like this report, for example.
This sucker is loaded with input.
Sam, as one friend to another, I really am just trying to do you a favor.
Mr. Drake is still in a sales meeting.
What do you mean, a sales meeting?
Why aren't I there?
I-I'm the Eastern the Western I-I'm the Southwest I'm the "Eastern Regional Sales Manager".
I don't know, but he said to rest up your arm because you're starting tonight.
Well, there's just probably some mix-up.
You know, maybe I missed a memo or something.
I'm gonna go, uh, straighten this out right now.
Don't you have a job to go to or something?
Mimi, call Maintenance.
All right, have your people coordinate with Marketing.
We'll get this campaign on the boards.
Will do.
Sorry I'm late.
I guess that about wraps it up.
Uh, say, before you go, I just want to say that I'm really backed up with paperwork, and I won't be able to make the game tonight.
What?
What?
Can't make the game?
Hey, wait a minute, Evan.
I-I didn't give up my office two weeks to let this guy do paperwork.
Easy, Heppel.
Heppel?
What?
You're Heppel?
But I thought that you were supposed  Oh, boy.
I-I am a ringer.
That's right.
I'm right, aren't I, that I'm a ringer?
Well, I'll be straight with you, Sam.
Sure, we originally hired you to pitch for the softball team, but, uh, actually, you've turned out to be somewhat of a surprise.
Oh?
Yeah, yeah, you're a much better hitter than we anticipated.
Come on.
Man, this really bites it.
I mean, here I thought you wanted me for my mind, and it turns out you just wanted me for my body.
Where have I heard that before?
Is it really that bad, Sam?
I mean, you make good money.
Everyone around here likes you.
What's the problem?
The problem is that, you know, as soon as softball season's over, I'm out of here.
You don't have to be.
We'll find a place for you.
I mean, uh, softball season next year.
No, no, no.
You know, if I'm gonna stay here, I want it to be for legitimate reasons.
I mean, come on, Evan, at least look at my report.
Now, if you think that I have what it takes, you know, after looking at that, to be an executive right here, right now, the way I am, then, you know, then fine.
But otherwise, I think you know, we should just shake hands like gentlemen and part company.
Ho!
Lock up your women!
Sammy's back.
Sam, you know, I'm sorry to hear about the termination there, buddy.
Yeah, tough luck, pal.
Yeah.
Hey, easy come, easy go.
No, truth is, it was a shock, but then I, uh  I went into the executive washroom, and I splashed some water on my face, and I looked in the mirror, and the mirror looked back and said, "You're not an executive, man.
Get back to where you belong".
All right.
Yeah.
Smart there.
I thought they only had mirrors like that in the movies.
It's good to be back.
Oh, Miss Howe will sure be relieved.
Yeah?
She said that you'd be shattered and we should all be really nice to you.
She did, huh?
Mm-hmm.
Well maybe I ought to go set her mind at ease.
Ooh.
Hi, Rebecca.
Oh.
How are you, Sam?
Well, I'm kind of shattered.
I was afraid you might be.
Do you mind if I stand here for just a little while?
It's kind of hard for me to go back out there after what happened.
I feel so humiliated.
You just take as long as you need.
Would you like to talk about it?
You mean about how bad I feel?
Yeah, you know, sometimes that helps.
Well, I feel pretty bad.
So bad.
I know.
And I feel terrible that I had to tell you.
Oh, well there's no sense in us both feeling so bad.
Oh, God.
I just hate to see you like this.
Oh oh.
You know Hmm?
sometimes these things happen.
But you will always have your job here.
Oh, it's not just losing the job.
It's that I was, you know, taken advantage of.
I know.
I know.
You know, that I was used, that I was just, you know, manipulated by somebody who just cynically wanted to get something from me.
Malone, what are you doing?
I-I'm feeling bad.
No, you are feeling pretty good.
Okay, I admit it.
I'm not a sad guy.
I'm a happy, horny guy.
You know we need pity, too.
Oh, God, you are choice, Malone.
You are just really choice.
You will do anything for a roll in the hay.
If you will play on my sympathies, then you will stoop to anything.
God, I am tired of fighting you.
I just don't have the strength to do it anymore.
If this is what you really want, then by all means.
Take me here.
Take me now.
Please, please.
Are you serious?
Oh, yes.
I want it bad.
Well, all right.
Is something wrong?
Oh, nothing.
Oh, baby, oh, baby.
Le-Let me get this straight.
Is this what I can expect in the way of full participation?
Until I get tired.
Was it good for you?
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
Hey, Sack-Happy, how you doing?
Hey, there, Rubber Thumbs.
Hey, I thought you'd be on a dim route by now.
I don't see you pushing many number one sacks there, Clavin.
What the heck are they talking about?
It's kind of a postal rap.
Hey, there's a flap that you had a brush with utility.
Ah, 604 is all the way.
Yeah, well, you know the scheme fin.
Yeah.
You know, I actually once thought of asking Cliff what it all meant, but then it occurred to me he might tell me.
Making your way in the world today Takes everything you've got Taking a break from all your worries Sure would help a lot Wouldn't you like to get away?
Sometimes you want to go Where everybody knows your name And they're always glad you came You want to be where you can see Our troubles are all the same You want to be where everybody knows your name You want to go where people know People are all the same You want to go where everybody knows your name.
Well, I, I can't put this off another minute.
What's up, Frasier?
I'm a man in a predicament, Sam.
I've got to find a gift for the dearest, sweetest, most wonderful woman on Earth.
So, you finally dumped Lilith, huh?
No.
It's our one-month anniversary, and I'm just stumped about what to get her.
Any suggestions?
Well, you could get her a nice "mank".
"Mank"?
Yeah.
You know, it's a mock mink.
I got one for Vera.
You cannot tell it from the real thing.
It's great.
Unless, of course, it rains, and then you just toss it in the dryer, and you leave the house for a couple hours.
Well, I suppose I'll think of something.
Wish me luck.
Hey, Cliff, new suit?
Oh, well, no, actually, I just had it dry cleaned there, Doc.
Uh, hey, Woody.
a beer, and uh, one for mi compadre here, Normie.
Are you all right?
Yeah, no, it's just Sorry.
I thought Cliff was going to buy me a beer.
Well, uh, well, I am.
Hey, hey, Norm, Norm, no, come on, now, knock it off there, will you?
Geez.
It's just that my annual civil service raise came in today, you know, at three and a half percent, just like clockwork, you know, as if, uh, carrying that bag wasn't honor enough.
Wow, Mr. Clavin, you got a raise, huh?
Yup.
I've been hoping for a raise for two years now.
I haven't gotten diddly.
Well, Woody, that is an outrage.
You ought to walk right up to Miss Howe, look her square in the eye, and demand diddly.
Ah, tell you what, you work overtime, you get over-diddly, pal.
And, uh, diddly- and-a-half on weekends, : and, uh, golden diddly on holidays, too.
Uh, Cliff, Cliff The secret is knowing when to stop.
Hey, uh, Sam?
Yeah?
Do you think Miss Howe would give me a raise if I asked her?
Well, let's see, uh, you're a good bartender, you've never had a vacation, you never been out sick.
Probably not.
Aw, gee, really, Sam?
Oh, she's tough.
Maybe if you get her in a good mood.
Uh, how do I do that?
Well, put her in a good mood, you know?
Be nice to her; compliment her.
Compliment-- right.
Yeah.
Okay, thanks, Sam.
Mm-hmm.
I'll do it.
Uh, what should I compliment?
I don't know; first thing you see, Woody.
Come in.
Miss Howe, did I ever tell you you have a nice?
uh, smile?
Thank you, Woody.
: Yeah.
Was there something you wanted?
Well, uh, Miss Howe, I've been here at Cheers for quite a while now.
I'm a good worker, I don't take vacations, I'm never sick, and I was just wondering if No, Woody, Woody, I'm going to have to stop you right there.
I cannot give you a title.
"Title"?
Yes, I know you deserve it, but the front office just doesn't let me hand those things out.
No, Miss Howe, you don't understand.
You know, sometimes people work here ten, 15 years before receiving a title.
How can I justify?
Miss Howe, I want a raise.
Oh, is that all?
That's fine.
How much do you want?
Just like that?
Well, of course.
I thought you came in here to beat me out of a title, but if you just want to settle for money, well, that's fine.
Wait a minute.
Let's just stick with this title thing.
No, no, Woody, you said you would settle for a raise.
Now, I'm going to hold you to it.
Oh, no, I blew it!
I should have demanded a title.
Money gets spent, but titles are forever.
No, Woody, I told you Doggone it, Miss Howe, you're not going to palm some raise off on me.
I don't want money.
I-I deserve a title.
Woody, I've met some tough negotiators in my life All right, you deserve it.
I'll go to the mat for you.
Congratulations.
You're the new Senior Bartender.
Get out!
Senior Bartender?
!
Wait till I tell my folks!
To think I came in here asking for a stupid little raise, and now this.
I just hope it doesn't go to my head.
Oh that's what's nice about you, Woody.
Nothing ever goes to your head.
Hey.
So, did you get the raise?
Sammy, Sammy, Sammy, Sammy, Sammy.
There's more to life than money.
Oh, no, you didn't get the raise.
I got something much better.
You're looking at Cheers' new Senior Bartender.
Oh, Woody, you didn't fall for that, did you?
Fall for what?
Oh, man, she conned you.
She talked you into accepting a title instead of a raise.
I don't believe you.
Hey, I'd like to see you do better.
: Hey she may be able to pull the wool over your eyes, but not mine.
As a matter of fact, I'll prove it to you.
You know, I'm due for a raise around here.
Behold the master here.
Woody, watch the bar.
Sam.
Mm-hmm.
Considering my new title, I don't think you can just give me orders like that.
You're right.
Please forgive me.
Um, I respectfully request permission to ask you to watch the bar, sir.
Money can't buy that kind of respect.
I was wondering The answer is no.
Oh, come on, a little raise is not going to kill you.
No, a little raise is not going to kill me.
And neither are those little free rounds of drinks we're always giving everyone.
Or the little bar tabs all our friends are always running up.
But you add them all together, and they spell bankruptcy.
Which is probably more than you can do.
Wait a minute.
What do you mean "bankruptcy"?
We're losing money, Sam.
And as long as we are, no one's getting a raise.
Nothing.
All right, all right.
But if you want to go out there and save face in front of your friends, I can give you a title just like I did Woody.
Oh come on.
A-a title to save face?
How childish do you think I am?
Senior Bartender, huh?
Well, Wood, you know, I'd say a, uh, little promotion like that kind of deserves a round of drinks on the house.
Aw, gee, Mr. Peterson, I'd love to, and I-I'm real sorry, but gosh, I-I just don't think I'd better.
Boy, you give a guy a title, he turns into a fascist.
So, Wood, now that you scratched and clawed your way to the top of your profession, are you still going to talk to us little people?
"Little people"?
Oh, right, uh, you folks don't like to be called midgets anymore.
Sure, I'll talk to you.
It won't be easy with your tongue in another state.
So, Sam, how much did you get?
Well, it's kind of complicated, Woody.
It's all tied up with bonuses and stock options.
But I can tell you that, uh, you're looking at the new Executive Supervising Bartender.
Well, congratulations, Sammy.
You know, I'd say a promotion like that kind of deserves a round of drinks on the house.
Nice try, man.
Well, you know.
You just couldn't stand it, Sam, could you?
That I had a title and you didn't.
Oh, come on, Woody.
These titles don't mean anything.
You want to switch?
Right.
Senior Bartender.
Like I've been dying for that one all my life.
Hey, at least mine's a real great title and not a stupid made-up one like yours.
Hey, mine is not made up.
Hey, hey, all right, all right, all right, knock it off, all right?
!
Will the Senior Idiot Bartender and the Executive Supervising Moron shut their yaps for about ten seconds?
You're bartenders.
That's it.
You're a bartender and you're a bartender, period.
Carla's right.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, me, too.
I, however, am the Managing Director of Waitresses.
Well, uh, congratulations, Carla.
You know, I'd say Give it up, Norm.
That does it.
What?
Miss Howe, I heard about Carla and Sam's new titles, and I must say I've got a problem.
You've got a problem?
I'll tell you about problems.
I will tell you all about problems.
We've been losing money for the last three months.
I have just been informed that if we continue to lose money, the bar is going to be put on the block, and then my career will be over, and so will everyone's drinking days here at Cheers.
Understood?
Well maybe it isn't exactly my place to say this, but Cheers means about as much to me as it does to anyone here.
This is, uh, pretty bad news.
I'd say bad news like this deserves a sympathy round of drinks on the house.
What?
Oh, what?
!
You really don't think we're gonna lose the bar, do you?
I don't know.
I mean, what are we gonna do?
Where are we gonna go?
Home?
All right, listen, listen, listen.
We-We got to think of some way to drum up business.
Well, what do you want us to do, force people to drink here?
Pour beers down their throats?
No, Carla.
Well, don't be hasty, Sam.
Let her talk.
Norm, you-you work for the big firms.
What do they do when they need a lot of money?
All right, first off, they They go and fire all the dead wood.
Yeah, then what?
I'm long gone by then, Sam.
Well, what if we got something real valuable that everybody wanted, and then gave away chances to win it?
A raffle?
Sam, would you mind giving my idea a little consideration before you just jump in with yours?
No, no, no R-Rebecca, hey, I think we, uh We put our heads together here and came up with a solution to your problem.
Sam, please.
This is my problem.
I'll handle it by myself.
No, hey, listen.
Everybody needs a little help now and then.
All right, Sam, what's your great idea?
Well, I-I think you're gonna like it.
It's-it's, uh, real special.
I-I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
It's, uh well, we hold a raffle.
Oh, please.
Well, actually, it was, uh, Woody's idea.
We could give away a Caribbean cruise.
Hey, Woodchuck, not a bad idea.
You think she just handed me this title?
Listen, it'd be perfect.
I mean, people would be pouring in here.
We'll be out of the red in no time.
Come on, let's give it a shot.
All right.
Why not?
It's a mark of how desperate I am that I'm willing to take any half-baked, hair-brained scheme from a bunch of bozos like this.
All we ask for is a little faith.
Eureka!
I have found it.
Sam, anything compare to the ebullient feeling one gets having discovered and then purchased a fine work of art?
Yeah, sticking your foot in a pan of scalding hot water when you got a fungus itch.
Well, you may not know art, but you know what you like.
So, uh, correct me if I'm wrong there, Doc, but that's from the, uh, Machiavellian Cubist era, isn't it?
No, Cliff, but, uh, thank you for participating just the same.
No, my anniversary gift to Lilith is an abstract expressionist piece.
Would it be rude to ask what something like that might cost?
No, not if you like and appreciate it.
Sorry to interrupt.
Say, Frasier, w-why'd you buy her a painting?
Why-Why not get her something she might actually want?
Oh, no, Lilith will love this.
Oh.
It's an original Tidwell.
See, it represents man's struggle against intransigent fate.
It's called Number Seven.
No.
Here, here.
Drink it in for a moment.
And what does it say to you?
It says, we got a live one.
I don't know.
I kind of like it.
Looks like a couple of dogs getting real familiar.
Oh, wow.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah, it sure does.
Somebody, hose 'em down.
I should have known better than to show you Philistines a fine work of art.
Rebecca?
Yes.
Uh, do you mind if I keep this in your office for a few days?
It's my anniversary gift to Lilith.
Certainly.
I hope she loves you very much.
Woody, aren't you finished numbering those Ping-Pong balls yet?
Almost.
I'm just putting happy faces on all the zeros.
There's a shocker.
Boy, I can't believe this.
This place has been packed for two weeks now.
This contest was a great idea.
I don't know.
I kind of like the way it used to be around here.
Yeah, know what you mean, Normy.
All these damn people here treating us like some kind of public gathering place.
I think this little raffle idea of mine turned out pretty well, don't you?
Don't you think you ought to give me a little thank you?
A little pat on the back?
Or you on your back?
Oh, Sam, when you say things like that, you make me love you even more.
You're being sarcastic, right?
Are you?
Oh, Dr. Crane, I'm glad you're here.
I hate to mention this, but you've had that picture of the two dogs in my office for quite a while now.
When are you giving that to Lilith?
I'm going to give it to her tonight.
And by the way, they are not-- and I can't say this more emphatically-- two dogs.
Whatever.
I want them out of my office.
They keep reminding me of how lousy my social life is.
Yeah, but to be honest with ya, I wouldn't mind winning that Caribbean cruise prize.
Yeah, call me Ishmael, but, uh Well, the Clavin men, uh, all go down to the sea.
I guess I must have salt water in my veins.
Too bad there isn't an air bubble.
Frasier?
Oh, why there she is now, the ray of sunshine I call my blushing bride.
Dear, that color jacket is not good on you.
Yeah.
Sorry, fellas, she's all mine.
You can't have her.
Well, anyway, Happy Anniversary, my sweet.
Same to you.
Are you ready for dinner?
Yes.
Oh, just first, I've got a little surprise for you.
Now close your eyes.
Oh, Frasier, love, I'm really not a proponent of surprises.
My father once asked me to close my eyes, and he left for two years.
Well, then, keep your eyes open.
Uh, by the way, are you familiar with the artist Tidwell?
Of course.
Isn't he the one who did the painting of the two dogs commingling, then sold it for an ungodly amount of money to some ninny?
Yes, that's him.
Well, what's my surprise?
Oh, surprise.
Well, it's nothing, really.
It's no big deal.
It's just, um, my car.
Why, Frasier, I'm overwhelmed.
Your Mercedes?
You know, nothing says loving like something from Stuttgart.
Shall we?
But what does this have to do with Tidwell?
Oh, well, that's his name, you see.
I give all my possessions, uh, pet names.
Well, by the way, my, uh, cufflinks, Bert and Ernie.
Attention.
Attention, everyone.
Now's the moment we've all been waiting for.
I hope you're as excited as I am, because this is probably the most exciting event I've ever been to in my entire life.
Well, e-except for the time that our prize cow Velveeta gave birth to a two-headed calf.
Now I don't know how many of you have seen a two-headed calf get born, but the ones who have will bear me out.
Woody, Woody.
Actually, it's not as exciting as you might think.
Only one of the heads could move.
Woody.
The other one just seemed kind of dazed.
Hey, Woody, pick the damn number, will you then?
Oh, okay, okay.
And the winner of the Cheers all-expense paid trip to the Caribbean is Number 99.
Hey, that's me!
Say, Woody, uh, when you turn this it kind of looks like a 66, doesn't it?
It sure does.
Uh, excuse me.
We have a correction.
The winner is 66.
Don't.
I've got it.
I'm 66!
Everybody, stop the music, stop the music!
What's going on here?
You called 99.
Oh, he's right.
It is 99!
Whoa, whoa.
Hey, stop the music here.
Uh, Wood, Woody, man, we've got a little problem here.
MAN 2: Hey, what's going on?
W-What's the problem?
You chose 99 first.
Yeah, but but 66 comes before 99.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, what the hell kind of place is this?
Who's the manager here, and why aren't they serving free drinks to calm this angry crowd?
This is This starting to stink as rotten as those, uh, game show fixes back in the '50s.
Gentlemen Gentlemen, excuse me here.
There's obviously been some mistake, and I'm very sorry about that, but would one of you please have the decency to just give up the trip?
No way!
Forget it.
Forget it.
No, lady, no.
Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, come on.
You guys don't really want to go to the Caribbean, do you?
Do you have any idea what the sun does to your skin down there?
Oh, what are you talking about?
I'll tell you what I'm talking Here, I want to introduce you to last year's winner, man.
He's actually 24.
I fell asleep on the beach.
Yeah, thank you.
See what I'm talking about.
Listen, lady, I don't want to be a hard case about this, but if I don't get my trip, you'll be hearing from my lawyer.
Hey, what's your boss's name?
I want to complain.
That's it.
I've had it.
My career is over.
Oh, no, come on, don't give up now.
Listen, you have come so far to get to where you are.
You gonna throw all that away?
Come on, go back out there and fight.
Show them how tough you are.
How?
Cry your pretty little eyes out.
No man can resist that.
That is insulting.
I will not use those tactics.
I will handle this in a professional, businesslike manner.
All right, all right.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
There has been a mistake made, but I am the manager, and I'm willing to take responsibility.
What's important to me is that I have two satisfied customers, so I'm going to see to it that both of you get that trip.
All right.
Of course, that will probably mean the end of my job.
My career.
My life, actually.
But I don't want that to have any bearing on this.
: I just want you both to be really happy.
And maybe you could send me a postcard from the Caribbean and address it to me at Oh, I don't know.
The YWCA or skid row or something.
Now wait a minute, there, dear, don't cry, uh  You won't lose your job.
I'll, uh, give up the prize.
You-You will?
Yeah, sure.
I never win anything anyway.
I've always been a loser.
I've never been able to hold down a job.
Uh The, uh, wife left me a couple of years ago, and the my, uh My kids won't talk to me.
I   Oh, there, there.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, listen, uh I-I don't really need to go to the Caribbean.
You go.
No, no.
No, no, no.
No.
I-I want you to go.
Oh, yeah, my wife will understand.
I'm married to the most wonderful woman in the world.
I mean, she's so kind, so understanding.
And to think that she can maintain such a wonderful attitude, despite being confined to that wheelchair.
It's just  That's That's the most beautiful thing I've ever heard.
You know something, they should both go.
Yeah, they should both go.
Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute.
What about my sob story?
I got eight kids.
Heard it.
Well, how can they both go?
We don't have enough money for two trips.
Well, that figures, huh?
Oh, what a rip-off!
MAN 3: Yeah.
Uh, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, take it easy.
Take it easy now.
Maybe they can't both go on a cruise, but they can Uh, they can both win a prize.
What are you talking about?
Well, sure, sure, our other first prize.
Listen, one of you guys can go on the cruise, and the other one gets this very, uh, very, special surprise.
Yeah, we have a We have a wonderful, uh, wonderful other first prize.
It's a-a beautiful painting.
Huh?
Oh, my God, is that an original Tidwell?
Y-Yes, it certainly is.
I've always wanted a Tidwell.
Um Uh, would, uh Would mind taking the cruise?
Not at all.
: Thanks.
Boy, I've dreamed of owning a Tidwell all of my life.
And you tried to tell us you were a loser.
Thanks.
Oh, music.
Say, does that, uh, painting give you any idea how to thank me?
Yes, Sam.
Next week, we'll all chip in and have you fixed.
Uh, excuse me, folks.
We still have the consolation prize to give away.
Ping-Pong balls.
No, Woody, Woody, Woody, man, don't do that.
All right.
And the winner of the Cheers consolation prize is Number 11!
Oh, no, here we go again.
No, Woody, let me explain something to you.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
There you go.
Cheers.
Oh, yeah, hi, Vera.
Uh, let me see if he's here yet.
Oh, yeah, he just walked in.
Yeah, here he is right now.
All right, bye.
Yeah, yeah, it's for you.
Hi, honey.
Yeah.
I, I have no idea.
I mean, uh did you try that broom closet?
Well, how about the pantry?
Well, that would be a good place to look, okay?
All right.
Okay, let me know, thanks.
Oh, here.
Well, what's Mrs. Peterson doing?
I don't know, she's looking for the fire extinguisher.
Was there a fire in your house?
I have no idea.
Should I have asked?
Making your way in the world today Takes everything you've got Taking a break from all your worries Sure would help a lot Wouldn't you like to get away?
Sometimes you want to go Where everybody knows your name And they're always glad you came You want to be where you can see Our troubles are all the same You want to be where everybody knows your name You want to go where people know People are all the same You want to go where everybody knows your name.
Attention, everyone, attention!
I'm getting rid of that television.
And I am replacing it this weekend with a new 27-inch screen TV with a direct hookup to the Cable Sports Channel.
Thank you.
Kind of a jerky thing to do, but I liked it.
That means we'll be able to watch that world welterweight championship bout between Hector "The Hammer" Rodriguez and Julio "The Hacker" Rodriguez.
Who do you think's gonna win?
My money's on Rodriguez.
Julio "The Hacker" Rodriguez has got a glass jaw.
My uncle Fergie had a glass eye.
He used to take it out and scare the cat.
This is Cheers, Dorothy.
Isn't it amusing?
Frasier, would you be a dear and get us some drinks?
Sam, can I have three martinis please?
Make mine a double.
How's married life treating ya?
Quite a change, huh?
Well, you know, Lilith and I did live together for a year before we wed.
So other than the fact that I now see it stretching endlessly before me, until I lie rotting in the grave, there's no real difference.
Now, Lilith, if you, your family, and generations of your ancestors had lived with the boot of oppression on your throat, would cutting out a man's heart seem that extreme?
So who's the party girl?
Dorothy Greenberg.
She's an old childhood chum of Lilith's from New York.
She's been visiting for a week.
She's a professional student.
She's writing her dissertation on the Comuneros' uprising in Paraguay during the 1700s.
She can't talk about anything else.
Believe me, when you've heard one Bruno de Zavala joke, you've heard them all.
Sam, I got to get this over with.
Listen, there's something I got to ask you, and I don't want you to take it the wrong way.
What is it?
Would you come to dinner at my house tonight?
Hey, I thought we were friends.
Well, it's just that Eddie wants us to practice our social skills so he can invite his boss over to dinner.
Can't you ask somebody else?
Please?
Come on.
I'm sure any one of the guys would love to go.
Guys, am I So, uh I'll expect you at 7:00?
Yeah, all right.
All right.
Where'd you guys go?
Go?
Huh?
We were right here all the time, Sammy.
By the way, uh, thanks for hogging that invitation to Carla's house all for yourself.
There's room for one more.
Sam, you sit here.
Thank you.
What is this, Sammy-- no date?
Uh, your mom didn't want me to bring one.
I always like to be the prettiest woman in my house.
And you always will be, baby.
You're no magazine cover yourself.
Now.
Oh, these look great.
Mm-hmm.
You know, Carla, it's, uh, nice to see you surrounded by such a loving family.
Oh, it's eerie, Sam.
Mmm.
I got a husband who does windows.
And all the kids are out of jail.
For the first time in my life, when morning comes around, I want to open up my eyes instead of my wrists.
That's beautiful, honey.
Uh, and who knows, Ma?
Someday well, you can look forward to having grandkids.
: Carla, a grandmother?
You've got to be kidding.
No, no.
Sammy, it's true.
I think I'd like to be a grandmother someday.
I mean, get all the fun, none of the responsibility.
Just seeing the little brats when I want to.
I think you're gonna be surprised what a sweet little old granny I'll be.
That's great, 'cause I knocked up Annie good.
What!
?
Hey, hey, hey!
Oh!
Oh!
Carla!
Carla!
Carla!
What are you thinking of?
!
I just waxed that table.
Come here, come here.
Come on, come on.
Get off.
Come on.
Come here, come here.
And besides this is family business.
Let's, um Let's talk about this later, okay?
So what kind of car do you drive, Ed?
I thought you said you wanted to be a grandmother.
Someday.
Like years from now, when you've moved thousands of miles away.
Carla, please.
I drive a Corvette myself.
How could you do this?
!
Hey, I'm going to be 20 in two years.
I can hear my biological clock ticking.
Do you know what it takes to raise a kid?
Ma, will you relax?
I got a job.
You think you can support a family pushing cheeseburgers?
!
Well, I thought we'd all stay here.
Ho-ho, great.
More people in this house.
I get about 19 on the highway, Whose stupid idea was this anyway?
Hey, I was getting bored sitting around the house.
I thought this might give her something to do.
I'll give you something to do!
Oh!
No, no.
Carla, Carla, Carla!
Come on.
Well if this is the way that we are going to be treated on the happiest day of our young lives, then I don't want to live in this house anymore!
Anthony!
You should probably come with me.
But we haven't eaten yet.
Your hair is full of bread crumbs.
We could butter your head and make a sandwich.
I had a sandwich for lunch!
Oh, go on.
Go, go!
Get out of here!
Let's see how long you last on your own!
I give you three days!
Two, two tops!
You hear me?
Carla, come on.
Calm down.
Sammy, you get 15 in the city?
Hey, so they're gonna have a baby.
They'll, they'll find their way through it.
You don't understand.
My life is over.
I'm going to be a grandmother.
I mean, I might as well wrap myself up in a black babushka, get fat and grow hairs out of my moles.
Oh, come on.
You're exaggerating.
Do I have to get out the family album?
Oh, God, this is terrible.
Look at my life.
I never had a childhood.
I married Nick when I was 15.
Never got to go to the prom or homecoming, to a slumber party, to Fort Lauderdale on Spring Break.
Or on one lousy date with Fabian.
Now I don't even get a middle age.
Go straight from grade school to Granny.
I don't know what to say, Carla.
Just don't say anything, okay?
There's nothing anybody can say that's gonna change anything, so just don't say anything.
Yeah, but, Carla Sam, I said don't say anything.
Weren't you listening to me?
Yes, Carla I said don't say anything!
Nobody listens to me.
I listen to Shut up, shut up, shut up!
Just stay away and leave me alone!
I'm going to my room, wait for the angel of death.
Oh, here's one of my favorite paintings of the Comuneros.
It depicts the peasant army struggling to push this cannon to the top of the hill.
Later, they found out they were on the wrong hill and had fired on their own village.
These people had no luck.
That's fascinating, Dorothy.
Isn't that fascinating, Frasier?
Oh, yes, yes.
You know, these stories make me long to visit Paraguay right now.
I hired you as a temporary waitress.
What on earth were you doing with your blouse off?
Serving drinks.
This is not a topless bar.
What, I'm supposed to get tips for good service?
Yes, dear, that's the way we do it around here.
Well, I'm sorry, but I don't beauties like these under wraps.
Out.
Out!
God, that is the fourth temp waitress we've gone through.
I hate this bar.
Excuse me, Miss, can we get some service?
Yes, sir.
Miss, this martini is too dry.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'll take care of that.
I've had it.
Isn't Carla ever coming back?
I was not born to be a waitress.
I was born to manage waitresses.
Oh, Miss?
You'll get it when I'm damn good and ready!
Oh, God.
Well, we tried to cheer up Carla, but I don't think it worked.
Yeah?
How far did you get?
About a half block away.
She hit Mr. Clavin with a rock.
Woody, uh, would you have a little look-see?
Is there a lump up there?
Well, let's see.
No.
Gee, Mr. Clavin, do you pluck your eyebrows?
We can't get along without Carla here.
How can we get her back?
Uh, well, I don't know, but let's start at square one here.
We know that, uh, she's upset about having a grandchild, right?
Another round, Sam?
Coming right up.
Table 11, please.
Well, she was complaining that she'd missed out on all that teenage stuff, you know?
Homecoming, proms, may What-What if we do something to take her back to her teen years?
Like get her pregnant?
No.
That's been done to death.
W-What else did she say?
What else?
Uh, let me think, let me think.
All right, something about a sleep over.
No, no, I know.
Slumber party.
Yeah, slumber party.
A slumber party?
Right.
Well, that's it.
Why don't we just throw the woman a slumber party, and that'll cheer her up.
Recreating a ritual of youth is often just the thing to get someone out of depression centered on a fear of aging.
I find it also helps to listen to heavy doses of Credence Clearwater Revival.
Great.
I'm gonna do that.
All right.
Just one question.
What-what do you do at a slumber party?
Well, the phrase "slumber party" would imply that one sleeps, but somehow I sense that's meant to be ironic.
Terrific.
We're really on a roll here.
I have a patient of that age.
I suppose I could do some research and help you put something together.
Thank you, Lilith.
I would really appreciate that.
Certainly.
Say, Rebecca, if you're in need of some extra guests, I know a couple of fun-loving gals who could really use a night on the town away from boring old me.
And, uh, Lilith, you've always told me that you found Carla an interesting, uh psychological case study.
Won't you be lonely?
Well, it'll give me a chance to be alone with Dorothy's books and a roaring fire.
Well, what do you say, Lilith?
Big wheel keep on turning Proud Mary keep on burning Rolling Rolling Rolling Rolling  Rolling on the river You know, you don't often get to see them loosen up like this.
: Come on in, the coast is clear.
Hi, Eddie.
Hey, how you doing?
Good.
Hi, uh how are you?
There you go.
Thank you so much.
Sure, sure.
All right, I'm gonna put on the 45s.
Where's Carla?
She's in the back room knitting.
Oh, that's a sign she's perking up.
I don't think so.
It's her death shroud.
Oh, no.
I forgot the marshmallows for the hot chocolate.
That's okay, we'll use the ones for the s'mores.
Then what will we use for the s'mores?
Why don't we just skip the s'mores?
You've been trying to get rid of the s'mores since we've started.
No, I haven't.
You most certainly have Shh!
Shh!
Go get Carla.
Hey, Carla, could you come out here for a second?
No!
I'd like to discuss something about your, uh, grave site.
Be right there.
Now!
Surprise!
What the hell are you doing here?
We're having a slumber party!
That's right, Carla.
Hold on to your hat; the gals are here.
Eddie, get the gun.
Now, Carla, we know you're down, but being alone is no way to deal with depression.
You need your friends around you.
Good idea.
Who the hell are you?
Dorothy.
Dorothy Greenberg.
Well, listen, Dorothy, Dorothy, get the hell out of here, and take all this crap with you.
Now, come on, Carla.
Go, go, go!
Come on.
Why'd you let them in?
Because for the last four days you've been sitting around moping and whining and scaring the kids.
I mean, for God's sake, you haven't yelled at them once.
Don't you think children notice those things?
You're right, I'm not a fit mother.
I'll leave immediately.
No, no, no.
Come on, Carla, look.
Look, if you're not gonna do this for yourself, will you do it for me?
I can't live with you like this anymore.
Look, sweetie, gi-give it a chance, would you?
Come on, give it an hour.
Look, if I do this, would you and the Supremes promise to leave me alone, get off my back?
We promise.
All right, let's get the thing over with.
Let the slumber party begin.
I'm going to take off for about an hour, then I'm gonna come back and help you clean up after you have all your wacky gal fun.
Bring body bags.
Well, Lilith, you have the list.
Where do we start?
All right, let's see.
All right, so on the list we have to do, uh, each other's hair.
Then we talk about boys.
Ooh, tell scary stories.
Have a pillow fight, and then for the grand finale, assorted madcap pranks.
What kind of pranks?
According to my patient, when the first person falls asleep, the others take her underwear, dip it in water and then put it in the icebox for an hour to freeze it solid.
Or they could let you wear it for ten minutes.
Why don't we just move to the pillow fight?
Do that again, and they'll be tracing you in chalk.
Uh-oh, Carla.
I saw the corners of your mouth twitching.
Are there little elves pulling on them?
Up.
Up.
Oh, here they go again.
Are you trying not to smile?
No, I'm getting ready to spit on you.
Yep, in a little under an hour, Hector "The Hammer" Rodriguez will be nailing Julio "The Hasbeen" Rodriguez into the canvas on our new TV.
Cliffie, in your dreams.
I say "The Hammer" goes down in five rounds.
You're on.
I say three.
Two.
All right.
Get some money up here.
We don't even have a manual.
How are you gonna hook that thing up?
Easy, Sam.
They included a special videotape showing exactly how to hook everything up.
So all we have to do is hook everything up, watch the tape, and then we'll know exactly what to do.
Okay, how long before Woody spots the flaw in his reasoning?
I say, uh, eight minutes.
Give me three.
Okay, I say five.
I say two.
Yeah, I'm in, I'm in.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
There you go.
I'm in for ten.
Cheers.
Sam, we're over here at Carla's, but things aren't going very well.
I thought that maybe you guys could come over and crash the party.
You know, something to shake things up a little bit?
I'm desperate.
Oh, really?
I bet you're kind of sexy when you're desperate, huh?
Breathing heavily?
Sam.
Is your chest heaving?
Sam, please.
Is your nightgown clinging to your sweat-soaked body?
Yes.
We're on our way.
Hang on here.
How can I hook this up to watch the tape if I don't know how to hook it up?
Uh, two minutes.
No.
Who had two?
Listen, guys, uh, that was Rebecca.
Uh, slumber party's gone sour.
Let's go help her out.
Wait, wait, Sam, what about the fight?
Oh, come on.
You think Woody's gonna be able to fix that?
No one but Carla can hook up a TV around here.
So we'll go cheer her up and bring her back.
Don't be so harsh on the kid, Sam.
Have a little faith here.
Wait a minute.
What are all these wires?
Party's gone sour, you say.
Want another s'more?
Not sweet enough for me.
I think I'll just have a bowl of syrup.
Look, Carla.
Lilith's hair is coming out nice.
Yeah, in clumps.
Carla, do you want me to fix your hair, too?
What do you say?
I say your hour is almost over.
Right.
Um, let's see what's next on the list?
Ooh, good!
We get to tell scary stories.
You want to hear a scary story?
I'll tell you a scary story.
My life, that's a scary story.
Wonderful, Carla!
Okay, who's next?
Oh, I hope it's not some boys trying to crash our slumber party.
What?
!
Hi, listen.
What?
!
I know, I know you don't want to see me.
But I'll bet you want to see the Four Swell Guys.
We're going to be bringing you memories of your swinging teenage years.
: Do you remember this, Carla?
Duke, Duke, Duke, Duke of Earl Duke, Duke, Duke of Earl Duke, Duke, Duke of Earl Duke, Duke, Duke of Earl As I walked through this world Duke, Duke, Duke of Earl Nothing can stop Shut up!
Duke, Duke Why do you all keep coming over here?
We're trying to cheer you up.
Well, stop it!
You can't cheer me up.
Why do people think they always have to rush over a-and talk somebody out of it when they're feeling lousy?
Look, this grandmother thing is just something I have to work through, and I will in time.
There's nothing any of you guys could do.
Unless you can make me 15 again.
Can any of you make me 15 again?
Well, can you?
Look, if you really cared about me, you would just get out of my house and do what I asked you to a long time ago.
Just just leave me alone.
You mean you really want to be left alone?
Let's go, guys.
Come on.
Now what?
The party was stupid.
This was not a stupid party.
Oh, well, I stand corrected.
It was the social event of the season.
Shut up.
Oh, yeah?
You want a punch in the mouth?
You're gonna be all right?
Yeah.
I appreciate what you tried to do, Sam.
I'll be okay, you know?
You know, something always comes along, some little something, makes everything work out.
But I got to find it myself.
You can't do it for me.
All right.
You know my number.
Sorry, Carla, I, uh  just forgot my jacket.
Darn these pants.
Why do they keep doing this?
I had them fixed.
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
Carla, you look spiffy.
You going out tonight?
Yeah, Eddie and I are catching a movie.
This is his last night in town.
He's going out on the road again with the ice show.
Uh-oh.
What's that supposed to mean?
Oh, nothing.
Well, you know, I get this image of, you know, chorus girls in skimpy costumes, you know, skating around, lonely husband on the road, far away from his, uh, connubial connubials, if you know what I mean.
Well, y-you're not worried?
Not at all.
I know my Eddie, and I trust him completely.
He is the sweetest, most faithful, loving husband in the whole world, and I thank God every day he married me.
If ever there was a one-woman man, it's Eddie LeBec.
Hey, Carla, what movie you going to see?
Fatal Attraction.
Making your way in the world today Takes everything you've got Taking a break from all your worries Sure would help a lot Wouldn't you like to get away?
Sometimes you want to go Where everybody knows your name And they're always glad you came You want to be where you can see Our troubles are all the same You want to be where everybody knows your name You want to go where people know People are all the same You want to go where everybody knows your name.
Good evening, everyone.
You'll be glad to know I decided to take your advice and become more dynamic.
I have just left a seminar that has changed my life.
In a few short hours, I have become the essence of self assertiveness.
Five.
Four, three, two, one!
What's going on here?
What's going on?
Hey, I run this place.
What's happening?
Yeah!
If somebody doesn't tell me what's going on, I am gonna start crying.
Aw, we're sorry.
Uh, we didn't know you were here.
Today is our anniversary.
This is the day, two years ago where Cheers beat that scourge down the road, Gary's Old Town Tavern, in bowling!
That's-That's the big deal?
It's the only time we ever won anything.
I take it that they've beaten us at things.
At everything.
Touch football, softball, darts, ugliest toes, you name it I think the current tally is 173 to one, but we are presently on a winning streak.
Yeah!
We're number one!
We're number one!
We're number one!
Yeah.
We're number one!
Sammy!
Sammy!
Isn't it about time for the call?
Oh-ho!
By golly, yes, it is.
Time to give him a call?
Hear ye, hear ye.
It's time for the ceremonial call to Gary's!
The call!
The call!
The call!
All right.
Yeah!
Hello, Gary.
It's Sam Malone.
Yeah, I was just calling to say hi, see how you're doing.
No.
You know, for the life of me, I-I can't think of what brought you to mind.
No, wait a minute, may Maybe it was because two years ago tonight, we waxed your heinie in bowling!
Yeah!
No, no.
Oh The poor sap is begging for a rematch.
No.
No, no.
I'm sorry, Gary, no.
No, there'll be no rematch.
The moment of victory is frozen in time.
That's right.
Gar Hello?
Gary?
The guy is such a poor loser.
Drinks on the house!
Carla, Carla, once more around the bar, huh?
Huh?
All right.
We're number one!
We're number one!
Hold it.
Hold it!
Where is the trophy?
Who moved it?
What?
Oh, come on.
It's got to be around here somewhere.
Hey, now listen, this is not funny.
Where is the trophy?
Wa-hay-hay hait a minute.
This smacks of Gary.
Hey, you mean he had a spy in here?
Yeah, hey, that's right.
Who was that guy at the end of the bar drinking imported beer?
Mm-hmm.
Very suspicious.
You know none of us can afford that stuff.
Let's storm the place!
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Come on, let's not turn this into mob rule here.
Just a couple of guys go over and talk to him first.
Come on.
All right, Sam, I think you better take me because, uh, they got to be intimidated by the authority of my uniform.
Uh Actually, I think I'll take Woody.
You know, in case there's some trouble, I'd like to have someone young and strong around.
Come on, Woody.
Good luck.
Oh!
Our trophy!
Oh, Sam!
What did you do to Gary?
Did you punch him right in the face?
Uh, n-not exactly, no.
He did ask out a waitress.
Hey.
Sam.
Hey.
What are you all sitting around here like a bunch of wimps for?
It's what wimps do.
Let's go over to Gary's and torch the place!
Come on!
Oh, no, no, come on, whoa, whoa.
There's got to be a cooler way of doing this now.
We got to use a little cunning.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'd like to do something to Gary and make him really miserable.
Why don't you marry him?
Why don't you?
Why don't you?
Why don't you?
You!
You!
You!
You!
That's it!
I do not want this thing getting out of hand.
If this bar becomes a high school locker room, my patronage, other than the Bowery Boys, will disappear.
No, in this case, I'm afraid I must agree with Rebecca.
Thank you, Dr. Crane.
Well, it's-it's not for your dollar-grubbing, you know, front office, kissy face reasons, but it's because revenge is never the answer.
You see, a potentially unending cycle of juvenile retaliation can only lead to a well, a kind of mob mentality, which will ultimately result in a regrettable act.
Wait a minute, Doc.
When Diane left you at the altar, aren't you the guy who enrolled her in every tape, book, and record club known to mankind?
Yes, but that was different.
The pompous witch deserved it.
No, no, no, no, come on.
We got to think of something to get our pride back.
Like what Sammy, huh?
Well There is one thing you can beat Gary's Old Town Tavern at.
Oh, yeah?
What's that?
Maturity.
It's Al.
Hey, Al, why aren't you at Cheers?
Holy mackerel, this isn't Cheers?
Uh-oh, Malone's back.
And this time, he brought some muscle.
Ooh!
Sammy, I-I can't go through with this, not when this guy's taking shots at me.
No, no, that was a shot at me.
You're right.
Yeah.
Okay.
Gary?
Mm-hmm.
We're here in peace.
Now we want to let bygones be bygones, so we brought along some champagne to bury the hatchet.
What do you say, huh?
Is that right?
No tricks?
No tricks.
Wow, that's damn decent of you, Malone.
Milt, some glasses.
I'll be honest with you.
I mean, last night at Cheers, all we could talk about was revenge.
That trophy meant a great deal to us.
But then, you know, cooler heads, light of day and all that kind of thing, we just well, we realized that to do battle with you would just destroy both of us.
At least we have the satisfaction of knowing that we, uh, we beat you in one thing.
Maturity.
Oh, actually, I'm afraid you came up short there, too.
I just sent a dozen roses over to Cheers with an apology note.
Oh.
Oh, well.
Here's to Cheers.
No, no, no.
To Gary's.
Yeah, to Gary's!
Yeah!
Whoo!
Gary, Gary, I think maybe you ought to keep that back window locked.
You know, people could sneak in here and steal some of this fine crystal.
Come, my little vandal, our job here is done.
You know what gets me about this, Malone?
It's how weenie this stunt was.
This is the best you could come up with?
I am embarrassed, all right.
Not for me, but for you.
That's pretty small.
Oh, yeah?
I told you we should have fixed his brakes.
No, no You think I'm humiliated?
I'm not humiliated.
Pretty weenie.
Now I'm humiliated.
Then, after lunch, I had a patient.
Three separate personalities, each one more boring than the other.
As a matter of fact, he's the only one who can tell them apart.
Now, Lilith, darling, let's remember our caveat.
No more shop talk.
It's the weekend.
It's time to engage in nice, normal conversation.
I'll, uh, get us some drinks.
Woody?
Why do you have this obsession with labeling everything?
Normal, abnormal, weekday, weekend.
Well, darling, I was only trying to create a certain In other words, control the conversation.
That's rather compulsive, isn't it?
Well, how anal of you to notice.
Oh, the whole world's anal to you.
Well, what say we, uh, sleep in late tomorrow and have eggs Benedict?
I love you.
Pest control.
Where should we start?
Excuse me.
What's this about?
Your rat problem.
Rat problem?
Aren't you the one that called about a rat problem?
No, of course not.
No.
We don't have rats.
Well, that's what we understand, ma'am.
Rats in the building-- big gray ones.
That's why we're here.
Excuse Everybody hold on.
There are no rats here.
Oh, of course, Rebecca, we believe you.
If you should run across any white ones, about yea big, I'd be happy to give you four dollars apiece for them.
What do you use them for?
Snacks.
Everyone just stay where you are.
There are no rats.
Free round of drinks on the house.
I wouldn't do that, ma'am.
Those little buggers might already have gotten into your beer.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I'll chance it.
Sam, did you call anyone about a rat problem?
No, no.
We have a rat problem?
Ew, God.
I didn't call, you didn't call.
Who called?
Gary.
Gary.
Gary.
How did he know we have rats?
Uh, look, if you need us, uh here's our card.
Come again.
"Now that's a stunt.
Love, Gary".
He's mine.
Mess with us, huh?
Wait till he finds the prune juice in his Kahlua.
Yeah, what about the sneezing powder in the ventilation system, huh?
That was the coup de ville, huh?
Yeah, Gary's messed around with the wrong guys.
I wish I was there to see the stupid looks on their faces, you know?
Hey, hey, who's the chrome dome?
I don't know.
I've never seen him before.
Uh-huh.
Afternoon.
I'll have a draft.
Excuse me there, uh, pal of mine.
Yeah?
Eh, what exactly are you, uh, doing in here?
Getting a drink.
Aha.
So, uh, you're not from the neighborhood, are you?
No, no, I'm from Framingham.
Uh, my wife's at Mass General.
She just had a double bypass, and I thought I'd unwind a little with a drink.
That okay?
Sure.
Let's shave his head and put him on a bus!
Excuse me.
On second thought, I think I'll check to see if they have a juice machine in the ICU.
Yeah.
You do that, pal.
Hey, you tell Dr. Gary the gang at Cheers says hello.
Huh?
Right, huh?
: Okay.
I don't know.
What, does he think we're idiots or something?
Did anybody remember to grease the bar stools over at Gary's?
Oh yeah.
Yeah, I did.
Woody, get this man his favorite.
Hello, everyone.
Thank you, thank you.
You're too kind.
May I please see the manager?
I'm the manager.
Can I help you?
Oh, so you're the manager.
Finally something in this place worth looking at.
I'm, uh, Gary from the Old Town Tavern.
Well, well, well.
I never expected to see you step foot in this bar.
Now I can call the exterminator.
Oh, gee, I'm sorry you feel that way.
Although I can't say I blame you.
Things did kind of get out of hand, but hey, we're both professionals here.
Why don't we just call this whole thing off before we lose any more customers?
Look, uh, I have to admit, that when I first heard that you personally authorized some of these pranks, I was a little ticked off myself.
But now that I've met you, why don't we call that water under the bridge, and have a new era of peaceful coexistence?
Hmm?
All right.
Truce.
Whoa, I feel like a giant weight has been lifted from my shoulders.
Do you mind if I call you sometime and maybe we go out for a cup of coffee?
Sure, why not?
I like coffee.
Uh, see ya.
How could you do that?
How could I do what?
After all that's happened around here, you can go on a date with that rat?
Would you please not say that word?
I happen to think Gary made a lot of sense.
Besides, he's kind of cute.
Cute?
!
You think Gary's cute?
Yeah, he's got a real cool face and a nice body.
He looks kind of like an athlete.
Hey, what am I?
Jealous.
Excuse me.
There are sheep in my office!
Whoa, sheep.
Ho-ho!
You got to admire that, huh?
I thought it smelled like home.
I'm gonna get him.
I'm going to rip his head off.
Aw, but he's so cute.
And then I'm going to tie him up, and I'm going to take a lighter, and I'm going to torch him from the tip of his toes to the top of his head.
How come you never do stuff like that to me?
Don't worry about it.
Don't worry about it.
It's all taken care of here.
You all set?
Yep.
Tool box, check.
Coaxial cable, check.
VCR, check.
Tape.
Check.
Good luck, babe.
Carla?
Carla?
Carla?
You're not going to do anything illegal, are you?
What makes you say that?
Ladies and gentlemen!
Ladies and gentlemen!
Gary's Old Town Tavern is once again proud to present the finest in world-class boxing on the largest screen TV available in any bar in the greater Metropolitan Boston area!
Grab a drink, sit back, relax, and let the bloodletting begin!
TV  All right.
The months of waiting are over.
We've heard all the hype, we know how many millions are on the line.
This is the big one.
Here we go!
Good evening, I'm Norm Peterson.
And I'm Clifford C. Clavin.
Welcome to an evening of poetry.
We're so glad that you've chosen to ignore the fisticuffs they're watching over at Cheers right now, uh, three blocks down and on your right, drinks half price if you mention, "Gary sent me".
Tapped into the cable.
Instead, relax with us and enjoy as we read and interpret the many works of Dante Gabriel Rosetti, the famous 19th century poet and fancy guy.
Clifford?
Norman I'd like to start with "The Ballad of the Dead Ladies".
Ah.
An excellent choice.
It's written in iambic pentathlon with, uh, rhyming couplets, every couple of couplets.
"Tell me now, in what hidden way "is Lady Flora the lovely Roman"?
Oh, oh, oh.
Hey, uh, Gary.
What's up, buddy?
I want to know, did you enjoy the, uh, fight the other night?
Yeah.
Who'd you bet on-- Shelley or Keats?
You guys are great.
I tell you, I didn't know you had it ya.
You know what?
This is going to go down in the annals of gags as one of the greatest.
Here, give me your hands, guys.
I got something better for you, though, than a trophy now.
Come on, Gare.
No, no, no.
On the level.
No crossed fingers, standing on both feet.
I am a personal friend of Wade Boggs.
The Wade Boggs, who was gonna come over to my place, sign some autographs, but I rerouted him over here.
He should be here any minute.
You take good care of him, okay?
You guys are the greatest.
I didn't know you had it in you.
Take care.
Did you guys hear that?
Wade Boggs is coming here.
All right.
All right.
Who's Wade Boggs?
"Who's Wade Boggs"?
!
He's only the greatest third baseman in Red Sox history.
Guy's a pure hitter.
He's only popped up six times in five years.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
I'm standing in a room full of idiots.
That's true.
What's your point?
Gary's not gonna send the real Wade Boggs over to see us.
He's gonna get some guy in a Wade Boggs suit, claiming to be Wade Boggs.
We're all gonna slobber all over him, buy him drinks, beg him for autographs and Gary'll come in and bust a gut laughing at us.
Excuse me.
Can I help you?
Yeah, uh, Gary sent me over to sign some autographs.
Hi, I'm Wade Boggs.
Hi.
Wade Boggs, huh?
Yeah, how you doing?
I'm Babe Ruth.
Yeah, I'm his, uh, good friend Dizzy Dean.
And I'm Woody Boyd.
Are you sure that isn't Wade Boggs?
I mean, it really looks like him.
Oh, Carla, come on.
That's not Wade Boggs.
Wade Boggs is a big, strapping lad like myself.
Uh, Mr., uh, Wade Boggs, what, uh what are we batting these days?
Something like .
360, huh?
.
361.
Oh.
Well, welcome to Cheers, Mr.-- : Wade Boggs.
I thought you folks were, uh, Red Sox fans.
Oh, yeah, we're, we're Red Sox fans.
: Sure, Mr. Wade Boggs.
As a matter of fact, uh, we'd, uh, like to give you a nice welcome that we give all great sports stars that happen by to Cheers here.
Maybe I ought to get out of here.
Hurry, guys!
Let's get him!
Whoo-hoo!
Man, that guy was a lot quicker than he looked.
Yeah.
Let's, uh, check out this guy's wallet.
Find out who this joker really was.
Yeah, this, uh, this guy's name was Wade Boggs.
Wait.
Wow, what a coincidence.
Well, I guess Gary went to a lot of trouble to make up fake I.D.'s for this guy and credit cards and photo of him with Jim Rice and Dwight Evans.
Oh, I'm sorry I'm late, guys.
I had a rough night.
I was out showing Gary's steady chick the time of her life.
Whoo.
Did I miss anything?
No, no, just an average day.
We refilled the pretzel bowls, played a little darts, pantsed Wade Boggs, watched a little TV.
Wait, you did what?
Oh, man, we thought it was another one of Gary's tricks.
So that's who was running out there in his underwear in traffic.
You know, you see Gary has pulled off the greatest, most ingenious trick of them all.
He's gotten us to get ourselves.
Frasier's right.
We can't top this.
Gary's beaten us.
You know, it's really rather Machiavellian.
Hey.
Come on, guys.
So we've been humiliated in every sport.
We've still got something that Gary can't take away.
Our pride?
Hell, no.
We never had that.
We have got the great Wade Boggs' pants!
Well, it's either this or nothing.
We're number one!
We're number one!
We're number one!
We're number one!
We're number one!
Hey!
We're number one!
Pretty weenie.
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
Oh, Fras.
You make it home okay last night, buddy?
Yeah, thanks for putting me in that cab.
I figured you had a little too much when you started making fun of that longshoreman's mother.
Oh, Lord, I don't remember a thing.
What-what did I say?
Something like, uh, "Unions are for mommy's boys who can't get their own jobs," I think.
Oh, why didn't he kill me?
Well, you-you said you wanted to wait and take him on when there were more people here.
So, uh, you said you'd meet the guy back here today, about, uh, right about now, actually.
No, wait.
Whoa, whoa.
The guy couldn't make it!
Whoop, there he is.
Oh, oh!
No, no, no, no, no.
That's just a car.
Okay, why are you taunting me like some sort of play thing?
It's just my little hangover cure.
: Didn't help me a bit.
No, but mine's gone completely.
Making your way in the world today Takes everything you've got Taking a break from all your worries Sure would help a lot Wouldn't you like to get away?
Sometimes you want to go Where everybody knows your name And they're always glad you came You want to be where you can see Our troubles are all the same You want to be where everybody knows your name You want to go where people know People are all the same You want to go where everybody knows your name.
How you doing, Woody?
Fine.
Is that a new shirt?
You mean the one I'm wearing?
Yes.
You look very nice today.
Very cute.
Really?
You You mean it?
Me?
I mean, me-- you think me look cute?
Well, I did.
Hey, fella.
You a little sweet on Rebecca there, huh?
Nah, get out.
No, come on.
You've got that kind of dopey look.
Hey, get over here.
You can tell us, come on.
Well okay.
Uh, last couple of months, I have kind of noticed her.
In fact, if it weren't for Mr. Drake, I really might go after her.
Come on, Woody.
Hey, hey, that's good, Woody, good.
What's so funny?
No disrespect, Rhinestone Cowpie.
But I really don't think her idea of a hot date is a butter-churning contest in Tobacci-flats.
Hey, you're forgetting something.
Miss Howe said I was cute.
Yeah, but, Woody, I think she thinks you're cute, kind of like she thinks a puppy dog is cute.
Yeah, I know.
Hey, is that a cut?
Oh, so you guys really don't think she'd go for me, huh?
I may just have to show you.
You couldn't get to first base.
First base, nothing.
I can hit a home run with her.
Oh, come on.
Aah!
You can't hit a home run.
Can so.
In fact, by midnight tonight, I can get a kiss.
A kiss, huh?
That-that what you meant by home run?
Yeah, sure.
What else could it be?
I thought you meant go all the way.
You mean marry her?
Sam, where is your mind?
All right.
Wait a minute now.
I got ten bucks says Woody can get that kiss.
Come on.
Will you stop it, Norm?
I mean, Woody's got about as much chance of getting a kiss out of Rebecca as Sammy here.
Yeah.
Hey, whoa, wait, listen, sure, Woody can't do it, but you think I can't come through?
You know, rumor has it, Sam, that, uh, the woman finds you utterly repulsive.
Rumor?
Heck, it's in the newsletter.
Hey, would you guys give me a break?
You're talking to Sammy here.
I am the king.
Well, when was the last time that Rebecca said you were cute?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, Sam.
Might be time to hang up those lips, buddy.
Hey, no, no, no.
Hey, listen, I still got it.
And if you need proof, then fine.
I will get that kiss from her, and before Woody, too.
Oh!
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Well, there's an expression we used to have back in Indiana.
Yeah?
Same to you.
All right, all right.
I got ten bucks on Woody, huh?
Me, too.
I'll put, uh, 20 bucks down on the kid.
You're putting 20 on Woody?
Uh, you're right, Sammy, make that 50.
Come on, you're putting me on here.
No, Sammy.
I mean, look at that face.
Okay?
That sweet, innocent face.
The kind of face we all hate and resent, but we will cash in on it.
Okay, all right.
You know, I'm going to teach you doubters a lesson.
I'm gonna take all bets.
Okay, let's set the ground rules here.
All right, wait a second.
A kiss before midnight tonight.
It's got to be a full one on the lips, all four lips touching.
For an entire three count.
Wait, wait, wait, but, uh, there's got to be a bona fide witness.
No, I'll do it, I'll do it.
You know, I think this is gonna be better than our contest for the biggest spit bubble.
Hey, well, it's possible.
Explain this to me.
If, uh, the winner is gonna get a kiss from Rebecca, what does the loser get?
Well, uh a kiss from Norm.
Then, of course, there is no loser.
CLIFF : All right, Normie.
So, when are we gonna see some action?
Oh, what are you worried about?
I got all day here.
I'll see you guys.
Oh, Sammy.
Anyway, I got this sewn up.
I don't know, Sammy.
I'm on your side, but you know, a lot of women come into this bar wanting to meet the sexy bartender, and more and more of them are not talking about you.
Hey, wait, wait, wait.
Listen, you're not losing faith in me here, are you?
I mean, you-you still think I-I got it, don't you?
Sure I do, but you know, you can't take this thing for granted.
Get a little older, you got to work harder, or date uglier.
Well, you know, come to think of it, Woody is kind of cute, isn't he?
Mm.
Oh, this is not good.
: This is not good for my image at all.
I mean, if I let Woody win here, then every young punk with a pair of lips is gonna be challenging me.
All right, I got a way to go here.
Watch this.
Hey, hey, these go to table six.
And you owe 'em some change.
Hey, boss.
What, are you doing inventory?
That's right.
Boy, you know, it is getting warmer.
Maybe we ought to be ordering some more rum and  Sam?
Oh, my God, are you all right?
No.
Not that.
Mouth-to-mouth.
Are you sure?
Mouth-to-mouth.
All right.
Oh, God, does anybody know mouth-to-mouth?
I do, I do, I do.
It's okay, I'm all right, I'm all right.
Works every time.
Low, Sammy, real low.
Not worthy of the king.
Entering Nick Tortelli country.
Hey King Woody.
It does have a ring to it.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'll be right Yeah, say it Sam, see what you think.
King Woody.
Your Grace.
Hey, hey.
Afternoon, Woody.
Oh, yeah, hi.
Are you okay?
Oh, yeah, sure.
Great.
Oh, you wouldn't want to know anyway.
Well, of course I would.
Really?
Very much.
You sure?
Yes.
Honestly?
When was the last time someone actually struck you?
Well, see, I'm, uh, trying out for this part in a play.
It's a really important part, and it's a really well-known play.
Uh, Bus Station.
You mean Bus Stop?
I'll never get it.
This is great.
He's gonna be so worried about his dumb play, he's probably gonna forget all about the bet.
At least his memory loss isn't from senility.
Gee, I'm so glad you're on my side, Carla.
See, the thing is, the audition's tomorrow, and I don't have a chance to work with any of the other actors to prepare my part.
Actors have to do that, you know.
Say, Miss Howe, do you think maybe you could read with me?
Oh, gee, Woody, I'm sorry.
I-I'm really busy with this inventory.
Oh, yeah, sure, I understand.
I'll just lose the part.
All right, Woody.
But you have to promise to make it quick.
Thanks, Miss Howe.
Hey, I hope you don't mind, it's a love scene.
Did you hear that?
Love scene.
Ow!
Love scene!
Sometimes the little hamster falls asleep in the wheel.
Okay, if you could just sit here.
All right, Woody, but I'm expecting a beer distributor in five minutes.
No problem.
Sell it, make me believe it.
Carla?
Well, it really helps when you have an audience.
Is there gonna be any nudity?
Not unless you're planning something repugnant.
All right, so what are we doing here?
Okay.
The scene is between a wayward, young, rodeo buff, Bo-- that'd be me-- and, uh, the sexy showgirl, Cherie.
That's you, I guess.
Okay, uh So where do we start?
Uh, right here before it says, "They kiss".
Oh, oh, golly.
When you kiss someone for serious, it's kind of scary, ain't it?
Yeah, it is.
Now I'm supposed to kiss you.
Sorry, I, uh, hope I'm not interrupting anything here.
What is it, Sam?
Uh we're out of vermouth.
So order more.
Uh, is that okay?
Yes, if we're out of it.
We are.
Then order more.
Vermouth?
Yeah!
Sam, would you excuse us, please?
Okay, where were we?
Uh Wait.
Oh, oh, golly.
When you kiss someone for serious, it's kind of scary, ain't it?
Yeah, it is.
Sorry, I, uh I wouldn't interrupt like this except it's important.
What is it, Sam?
I ordered the vermouth.
Sam, would you get out of here?
We're right in the middle of a scene.
Oh, a play!
Oh, I love good dramatic stuff.
What is this, uh, Tennessee Ernie Ford?
Sam, get out.
Come on.
All right, all right, all right.
Play fair.
All right, all right.
Play fair?
That's my opinion of the play so far, but with enough rehearsal, it might play great.
Okay, let's pick it up.
All right.
Oh.
Oh, golly.
When you kiss someone for serious, it's kind of scary, ain't it?
Yeah, it is.
Wait a minute.
I just ordered two cases of vermouth yesterday!
Sam's crazy.
Better make that move, Sammy.
Time's getting short.
No, this is how I like it.
Late innings, game on the line.
Yeah.
The cool character steps to center stage.
Well, I don't know, Sammy.
You seem to be sweating a little bit up there.
No, I'm not.
Yeah, that's okay.
Nothing wrong with sweating.
I, myself, have perspired once or twice.
We could grow rice.
Oh, watch this.
Say, Rebecca.
Oh, excuse me for a minute.
Caroline, are you all right?
You look kind of depressed.
: Oh, Sam, it's the same old thing.
What?
I'm so in love with my boss, and I just can't get him to notice me.
Well, have you tried kissing him like this?
Oh, my God.
That was That was Oh, thank heaven you showed it to me.
There's no way anyone could possibly describe it.
If I kiss him like that, he's bound to fall in love with me.
Bye, Sam.
Bye-bye.
You two have a great honeymoon.
Thank you so much.
Anything to get my disc player back.
Hey, hey, hey By the way, Rebecca, how are things between you and your boss?
Anything, uh, I can do?
These lips remind you of anything?
Yeah, I think the liver in my freezer's gone bad.
What happened?
She couldn't possibly have seen through your little morality play.
Huh!
Oh hey!
What's going on here?
Whatever do you mean?
Sam and Woody are trying desperately to kiss me.
Boy, someone's a little full of herself, isn't she?
Come on, Carla.
What's the story here?
One woman to another.
Why would I tell you something about my two closest best friends in the whole world?
I'll give you a paid day off.
They got a bet.
They want to see who could kiss you by the end of the shift tonight.
Why would they do such an asinine, juvenile, thing?
Look at the contestants.
Actually, Woody's doing it 'cause they were razzing him.
Sam's trying to prove he still got it.
Other than that, just cheap thrills.
Don't tell them I know.
Wait a minute.
You're not cooking up something that's going to humiliate my friends and make them look stupid, are you?
Well, yeah.
How can I help?
Oh, Miss Howe?
Can I ask you a question?
Sure, Woody.
What do you want to know?
Um which key unlocks the storage room?
I don't know.
Hold it still.
Look carefully, very carefully.
You're getting sleepy.
Very sleepy.
Woody?
Very, very, sleepy.
You'll do whatever I say.
Woody, go to sleep.
Oh, no.
I made her disappear.
To recap, sitting in the bar today, we have, among others, a man who was actually simple enough to hypnotize himself.
I'd like to offer the suggestion that we've seen it all.
Ten hut!
Happily, I stand corrected.
Well, it's time for me to be all that I can be.
You enlisted in the Army, you idiot?
Hey, we do more by 9:00 a.m. than most people do all day.
And that's a selling point to you?
Yeah, and I've had a bellyful of that Ayatolah guy.
Quite frankly I don't like what's been happening in the Persian Gulf.
So, I'm off to, uh I'm off to Persia.
I just wanted to shake a few hands, say good-bye.
Kiss a few girls for the last time.
Well, baby this is good-bye.
Yep, this may be the last time you ever see this dogface.
You can always take a gander at this one.
Sam, I had no idea you were this dedicated.
This is a wonderful thing you're doing for our country.
Well, thank you.
Kiss me, Sam, kiss me.
No, I can't kiss another soldier.
Not after Kevin.
Kevin?
Who-who's Kevin?
Kevin was my boyfriend in high school, and we really loved each other, and then he enlisted in the Army, and I never wrote, and I never saw him again.
Well, he sounds like a creep.
Kiss me and make him jealous.
No, Sam, I'm sorry.
Come home safely, doughboy.
Damn!
I mean, what does it take?
!
Well, maybe you're being too subtle.
One hour.
I don't think either of you heartthrobs got the lips to win.
Serves you right if you lose, Sam, doing all that weird stuff.
Me?
What about you?
You-you and that acting routine.
You know something, Woody, I'm getting a little sick and tired of you.
You and your wholesome farm boy bit.
You're not so dumb.
I resent that.
You're just upset because you're not king of the hill.
Well, that's too bad.
And I'll tell you another thing.
I'm thinking about not writing you when you're overseas.
Oh, break my heart.
Sam?
Can I speak with you a moment?
You sure can.
Over there Over there Send the word, send the word Over there Yeah?
Sam, I know what you and Woody are up to.
I-I don't know what you're talking about.
I want you to win.
What?
I want you to win.
All right!
And they said that I was losing it.
Okay, so, uh, let's get on with the dirty deed here.
No, no, no, we have to make this look really natural.
Otherwise they'll think the kiss is a setup.
Kiss, oh, sweetheart, no, no.
Someone mislead you there.
Uh, we're supposed to sleep together.
You're trying my patience.
All right, all right; a kiss, a kiss, okay.
Uh so, uh, how do you want to do this?
All right, here's the plan.
You go home and change.
and I'll tell the others I'm really beat and I have to go in and take a nap in my office.
And you come back and wake me, and I'll act like I'm having this really erotic dream, and give you this long, passionate kiss.
Oh, God, I love this.
I love this.
Oh!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
Uh Carla's supposed to witness this.
Okay, bring her along.
Oh, and then I'll spit and rinse my mouth out to make it look really legit.
Nice touch, nice touch.
Yeah, so long there.
Oh, wait a minute.
What do you got on your lips there?
Oh, no one.
Can I talk to you a minute?
Listen, I know what you and Sam are up to, and I want you to win.
Hey, Cliffie.
Hi, Sam.
Where is everybody?
Oh, most have gone home.
Carla's in the back.
Rebecca's asleep in her office.
Rebecca's asleep?
Yeah.
She said she was up late last night doing the books, or something.
Mm.
Oh, yeah, she said she wanted me to wake her up right about now.
Better go do that.
Oh, no, no, that's, that's uh, my job.
Oh.
Want to help me here, Carla?
Mmm.
Mmm.
"Mmm"?
"Mmm?
Mmm?
!
Oh!
Sammy and Woody sittin' in a tree K-I-S-S-I-N-G  You were supposed to be Miss Howe.
That's a rotten thing you did.
Don't talk to me about rotten.
What about all this kissing nonsense?
Yeah, that's different.
There's money involved.
Well, I am going to say this once and once only.
I am a person who cannot be used.
Now if you'll excuse me, I've got to drive Mr. Drake's valet to the airport.
Call me a romantic, but I always knew you two would end up together.
I can't believe I kissed you.
Yeah, well, you're lucky I didn't punch your lights out, man.
Yeah?
You and what army?
Hey, hey, hey, guys.
Come on, now.
Relax.
Geez, you guys, you were tricked.
It's no big deal.
I mean, you're such good friends.
You mean a lot to each other.
I mean, don't walk away mad.
Go on, kiss and make up.
Remember, you both owe me a big wet one.
Ah Ah, I couldn't stay mad at you, Sam.
You're just like a brother to me.
Yeah, and if anyone ever does knock off the king around here, I guess I hope it's you, man.
No hard feelings?
No hard feelings.
Listen, Sam, now that everything's okay, can I ask you something, guy to guy?
Yeah, sure.
How was I?
Don't-don't do that.
No, I mean it's a question you can't ask a girl.
I mean, is there anything I need to work on?
No, see, I-I don't want to talk about this, Woody.
I was nervous, so I might have been a little dry.
Oh, for God's!
Yech!
No, I'm serious, Sam.
Hey, do you want to know how you were?
{END OF EPISODE 24}{START OF EPISODE 25}
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
Yeah, it's just a hop, skip and a jump from the office to the Ginza.
Look who just slithered in.
The carpet cobras, featuring Evan "The Snake" Drake.
I'm all right.
How are you?
Rebecca, I've got to use the phone here.
Oh, you're a phone person, too?
So am I. Isn't it amazing how much we have in common?
Thanks.
You know that Drake guy?
He's probably the kind of bloke that has his knuckle hair removed with electrolysis.
Yeah, he's probably got one of those electronic zappers that he uses to forestall his receding hairline.
And I bet ya, I bet ya a dime to a donut that he has his loofa and he rubs himself raw to get rid of his cellulite.
Well, it was in last month's Soldier of Fortune, okay?
Making your way in the world today Takes everything you've got Taking a break from all your worries Sure would help a lot Wouldn't you like to get away?
Sometimes you want to go Where everybody knows your name And they're always glad you came You want to be where you can see Our troubles are all the same You want to be where everybody knows your name You want to go where people know People are all the same You want to go where everybody knows your name.
Oh.
Oh!
Sam, listen.
Don't you find it interesting that of all the fine restaurants in Boston to dine, that Evans should repeatedly dine at Melville's right upstairs from where I can be found every day of the week?
No, no.
But I do find it interesting that your button's undone there, and your bra has a little bow in the middle.
So, uh, what, you think the big guy's finally coming around, huh?
No, he's in there using my phone.
Can't you see?
Since his divorce became final, he uses all of his spare time to be around me.
He is in my office right now sitting in my chair, his lips just inches from the mouthpiece that I use every day.
You're right.
I'm an idiot.
Excuse me.
Rebecca, can we talk?
Excuse me, Sam.
I'm being beckoned.
Listen, if-if this is what you think it is, can I give you some advice?
What?
If you're going to make an ass of yourself, take it outside.
I'm not going to make an ass of myself.
All right.
I was just getting it out of my system.
You wanted to talk to me, Mr. Drake?
Yes, yes, yes, I do, Rebecca.
Let's sit down here, okay?
Thank you.
Well, this conversation is long overdue.
I couldn't agree more, with all my heart.
You don't know what I'm going to say.
Oh well, I agree again.
Something something very exciting is happening to me.
It's going to change my whole life.
It's a huge risk.
Take it!
Take it!
I'm moving to Tokyo.
I'm going to take over the Japanese division.
I leave tonight.
Yes, darling, yes!
I told her to take that outside.
I don't believe it.
Everything was going so well.
Then everything went so black.
Oh, don't worry about it.
Women faint all the time.
Well, in cartoons, they do.
Do you think he noticed?
Yes, yes, I-I think he did.
He, uh, he said that every time he sees you, you do something more bizarre than the time before.
What did you say?
Well, honey, I had to agree.
He is leaving for Japan tonight forever, and I never got to tell him how I feel.
Well, hey No, wait.
You know, listen, why don't you tell him at the good-bye party?
What good-bye party?
The one you're gonna throw for him tonight.
Listen, it's a great idea.
I'll make it a a Japanese theme.
Yeah, yeah, we'll have chips and cheese.
Sam, I will never have Mr. Drake.
I will never have any man.
I will just dry up, crumble into dust and blow away.
Oh, come on.
That doesn't sound like you.
That sounds like some lovesick self-pitying, whiny No, that's you all right.
But I'm not gonna let you give up.
What do you care?
What does anybody care?
Listen, I pride myself in being a connoisseur of beautiful babes, and I'll tell you.
I'm not gonna sit by and watch a great woman like you going to waste.
It's like, a a thoroughbred pulling a milk wagon.
It's like a rare wine pulling a milk wagon.
Sam, I can't tell him.
Oh, please, please, do this for me, will you?
I've been watching this sappy movie for God knows how long.
I want to see if the girl gets the guy.
If only once I'd ever had any little bit of encouragement from him.
Some teeny, tiny shred of evidence that he even knew I existed.
Well, now, he-he did express some concern while you were out cold there.
Oh, yeah, I bet.
What'd he say?
Gee, I-I hope she's not dead.
He did?
Oh, God.
And all this time I thought maybe I was kidding myself.
for he's a jolly good fellow That nobody can deny.
That's a perfect illustration of life's bitter irony, isn't it?
Oh, how's that, Cliff?
I mean, would you pass the beer nuts?
There's a guy like Drake It's a fabulous job Hey, it's time to make your move.
Come on, he's had a couple of drinks.
His resistance is down.
He's feeling all warm, sentimental.
Hell, I think I'll tell him I love him.
All right, all right.
Mr. Drake?
Hello, Rebecca.
Hi.
You're not gonna faint, are you?
Oh, no.
No, I'm fine.
I just thought that this might be a good opportunity to tell you something that I've wanted to tell you for a long time.
Miss Howe, may I speak with you for a moment, please?
Carla, can't it wait?
I don't think so.
It's kind of a woman's problem.
Ah, leave those to the experts.
But I What?
What?
What?
Look, look, look, I wouldn't have butted in, but I know that tonight is your last chance to tell the boss you got a case of the screaming thigh sweats for him.
How did you know that?
Woody put out a special edition of the newsletter.
Why didn't I just write it on the bathroom wall?
I'm way ahead of you.
Anyway, look, I've been down this road a few times myself, and take it from a pro, there is one thing you always have to do before you tell a guy you love him.
What's that?
Lose the mustache.
Uh, Mr. Drake, there's something that I Evan.
Yes?
We're really gonna miss your carpet.
Yeah, you take care.
Anyway, Mr. Drake, there's something I've wanted to tell you a long time There you go, Mr. Drake.
Hmm?
Oh, thank you, thank you, Woody.
Damn.
I changed all my American money into yen.
I don't have a tip for you.
I'm sorry, Woody.
Oh, that's okay, Mr. Drake.
I don't need a tip from you.
Okay.
Cheap, cheap, cheap.
Mr. Drake, as I was about to tell you Hey, hold on, hold on Woody, Woody, come here a second.
I've got these company courtside tickets to the Celtics-Lakers game.
Will you take those in lieu of a tip?
Huh?
Yes, sir.
I-I hope you'll forget about that cheap crack.
What cheap crack?
You're a prince.
Anyway, Mr. Drake, um, I've wanted to tell you something for a really long time.
Mm-hmm.
Hold on there, you two.
Let's, let's get a picture.
Smile.
Ah!
Hmm.
Mm-hmm.
I just hate those flashbulbs, don't you, Mr. Drake?
Mr. Drake?
These are some USDA, uh, prime tickets here.
So, uh, who's going with you?
Oh, gee, I don't know.
Well, I think the obvious choice would be me, Woody.
I mean, Cliff here is always making fun that, uh, you're a yokel.
Whereas, I completely ignore the fact that you're a yokel.
Mr. Drake, I No.
Evan.
I'll call him Evan.
Evan I'm a man, you're a woman.
I No, no.
You get lucky?
Oh!
I'm sorry.
I The important thing, Mr. Drake, is that  I finally have you alone so I can tell you what I've wanted to tell you.
Pardon me, Mr. Drake.
Excuse me.
But we're gonna have to leave now if you're gonna make your plane.
Oh, yeah.
Thanks, bud.
But Mr. Drake, I've really got to tell you something important.
Uh, Rebecca, hold the thought.
Better yet, telex it, okay?
Bye, Rebecca.
Hold that drink for me, babe.
Sweetheart, sweetheart, he He's gone, and you got to go on with your life now.
I mean, you got to pick up the pieces and-and start behaving like a mature person.
Well, now you're cookin'.
All right.
Excuse me.
Mr. Drake seems to have forgotten his topcoat.
Tell him it's hanging on the coat rack.
Uh, I believe Mr. Drake's, uh topcoat is in the topcoat closet.
Sam, I said to tell him No, no.
Uh, yes, we keep all of our executive topcoats in this closet right here.
It's, uh, way in the back there.
Way, way in the back.
Watch the hat there.
Watch the hat.
There do not appear to be any topcoats in here.
Oops.
My mistake.
Ooh!
Is there a light switch?
Whoa, oh!
Does anyone have a key here for this closet?
I'm-I'm afraid we're gonna have to make a key there.
Can you hold on?
Yeah, but be quick.
Oh, dear.
Martin seems to be locked in the closet there.
Does anyone know how to drive a limo around here?
Well, I've driven a tractor.
It can't be that different.
No, Woody, when I said anyone, I meant Rebecca.
Well, in the future, Sam, you might try using a little something that's popular back in Indiana called "direct address".
I'm I'm sorry.
Sam, forget it.
I'm going to let that man out of there.
Hey, don't give up.
Don't give up.
What do you want me to do?
You want me to masquerade as a chauffeur, get him alone on the highway, and tell the man I want to have his babies?
Martin, I'll be getting that key now.
I love you, Mr. Drake.
There.
I said it.
I love you.
I love you more than anyone I've ever loved in my whole life.
I love you more than any woman's ever loved a man.
Mr. Drake?
Hello?
Ow!
Oh, God.
Rebecca?
What are you doing up there?
Where's Martin?
Uh Martin got sick looking for your topcoat, sir, so I'll be driving you to the airport.
I appreciate that, if it's not too much trouble.
Uh anyway, now that I've got you alone here, Mr. Drake, the real reason I'm filling in for Martin is so that I could tell you what I wanted to tell you all night.
What I've been trying to tell you since the first time I met you.
Get off my tail, scuzzball!
Mr. Drake, with all my heart Could you turn right at the next corner here, Rebecca?
We have to pick up Christy.
Oh, yes, sir.
Mr. Drake, with all my heart Christy?
Yes.
She's the young lady who is accompanying me to Japan.
"Accompanying" in the modern sense of the word?
Yeah, you might say so.
She's a very special woman.
Very up front.
Aggressive, even.
You know, the first time we met a few months ago, she was the one who actually asked me out.
God, that's refreshing.
Mm-hmm.
Ah.
Anyway you wanted to ask me something?
Oh, yes, sir.
I just wanted to tell you that that this is really a lot of car to handle.
I can't believe I have the strength to keep from swerving into the oncoming traffic and killing us both.
Sammy?
Yeah?
You mind if I ask you a question?
No, go ahead.
I've been trying to figure out your strategy.
Hmm.
You know, I've always admired you for being sort of a selfish, egotistical pig.
Why, thank you, Carla.
But suddenly, you're locking chauffeurs in closets, and giving going- away parties.
It's like you're bending over backwards to help Boss Howe score with Mega-Boss Drake.
Mm-hmm.
This kind of self-sacrifice isn't like you, and it's scaring me.
Please, please, tell me you have some sleazy ulterior motive.
Fear not, little one.
Aha.
So you don't think they're gonna make it.
I just wanted to bring this whole thing to a boil, so when it blows up, I can swoop in and gather up the pieces.
I call it my, uh, vulture position.
Sammy?
Mm-hmm.
You've got Wessonality.
Thank you.
Hey, hey, hey, huh?
How about that?
According to vulture time, I bet that's my, uh, wounded little sparrow right now.
Hello?
Hi, Rebecca.
O-Okay.
Uh, can you hold one second, please?
Quote: "Sam, I need your help".
Unquote.
Yeah.
I'm-I'm taking off right now.
Here we go.
Here we go.
Why don't you go in and sit down there?
Here you go.
There you go.
Do you feel like you can talk about it yet?
Thank you for bailing me out of jail.
Anytime.
Oh, God.
This has been the worst night of my life.
Oh.
Of anybody's life.
I pour out my heart and soul to the man I love, then he tells me he's taking someone else across the globe.
I hate guys like that.
And she's really cute, Sam.
Oh.
And they made out in the back seat.
And he didn't even roll up the window.
The man is a pig.
I tried not to look, but the rearview mirror was just huge, and I couldn't help it.
And then I got so upset, I just wrapped the company limo around a 7-Eleven.
Well, that is dreadful.
Very, very, very sad.
And then Evan and his cheap imitation Geisha bimbo whore grabbed a taxi.
While I had to stand there and wait for a tow truck.
Oh, and then this cop came along, and he asked me to see my chauffeur's license.
God, if only I'd had one.
Or if only I'd remembered to bring my purse with my own driver's license.
Or if only I'd resisted arrest and he just shot me dead.
Well maybe I ought to leave you alone now.
By yourself with some music with your depression alone.
Sam, can I offer you a cup of coffee or olives?
I didn't have a chance to go to the grocery store.
I, um just kind of don't want to be alone right now.
Then you shouldn't be.
You need consolation now.
And warmth.
Lots and lots of warmth.
You know, Sam, I don't have anything sexual in mind.
I just need a shoulder to cry on.
Oh, honey, you cry on anything you want.
Gee, Sam what I needed right now was a friend.
Mmm.
And you're the best friend I have in the whole world.
: No, no.
No, you got plenty of friends.
What, girlfriends, maybe?
Old college friends?
No I've kind of grown apart from my old friends, and I haven't had a chance to make new ones with work and everything.
Well, that that just leaves Yeah, you.
I'm your best friend?
Crazy, huh?
I really think I ought to go.
Sam, why?
Hey, I like you.
I mean, there's not anything I wouldn't do for you in the world, but I-I know what's gonna happen if I stay here.
You're going to cry some more, and I'll comfort you some more, and the next thing you know, uh, your pantyhose will be hanging from the lamp.
Sam, please, don't go.
Hey, I can't be trusted.
Trust me.
Le-Let me just leave here now as a friend, please?
Oh, I'm sorry, I Listen.
I want to try this.
For the sake of our friendship, I am just gonna resist my sexual urges, and that's all there is to it.
Now, come here.
There.
All right.
All right, now : You know that I loved Evan Drake since the first time I met him.
I'm sorry, this is not working.
Hot fire below.
Hello.
Hi.
Listen, if this is what it takes to be a friend, then I really want to give it a shot, okay?
So we've got all evening here.
Pour your heart out.
Where are you?
I'm downstairs at a pay phone.
But just, uh, pretend like I'm right there beside you, all right?
Thanks, Sam.
Yeah.
Yeah, you're welcome.
Well : as you know, I have loved Evan Drake since the first time I saw him.
I know.
Sam, this is silly.
Get up here.
No Sam, you know what I've been through.
You're not going to take advantage of me.
Oh, yeah?
Do me a favor, will you?
Check your bra.
How did you do that?
